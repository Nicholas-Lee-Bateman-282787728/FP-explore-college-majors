869335,A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8,B0006IUD9Y,Adam,"[2, 3]","I have long thought that some of the best stuff on TV can be found among HBO's Original Series. I'm a big fan of some of HBO's better known dramas including Rome and The Sopranos, as well as of some lighter fare such as The Ali G Show and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Strangely, I'd barely even heard of The Wire until very recently, when a friend of mine (who generally has very good taste) was raving about it. Up until then, I hadn't given The Wire a chance, which was a mistake.  At his suggestion, I purchased Season One on DVD and was quickly hooked.  I've recently completed Season Two and I remain very much into the story.Season 2 of The Wire begins with a new case, with a new focus - the Baltimore ports and union dockworkers smuggling various ""product"" ashore.  This aspect of the story is new, but most of the key characters (including all the significant law enforcement officers and the key members of Barksdale's crew, and of course, Omar) remain, although some have reduced roles.  Season Two also introduces a number of new characters, and they're every bit as well crafted and believable as those from Season One.This is likely not an original opinion, but I think what really sets The Wire apart is its realism. Granted, I'm an upper middle class nerd who's lived a coddled life, so I may not be the best qualified reviewer to comment on the realism of a show about drug dealers in the West Baltimore projects, but to me it achieves realism in a way that many if not most television (as well as big screen) dramas fail. It isn't over dramatized. The cops look and generally act like cops (they don't look like models and they live in crappy apartments, for example). The ""bad guys"", similarly, look and act like rational participants in ""the game"" would be expected to. The character development is excellent, and as a viewer I related to (even rooted for) characters on both sides of the law - in fact there are both protagonists and antagonists on both sides.I'd consider The Wire one of the best dramas in recent memory, and I'd definitely recommend continuing the series if you've already completed (and presumably enjoyed) season one.As for the ultimate endorsement, will I be continuing the Series? You bet, I'll be ordering Season 3 on Amazon soon after I submit this review.",5,Just as good as the superb first season,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,2295,"['have', 'long', 'thought', 'best', 'stuff', 'TV', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'HBO', 'Original', 'Series', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'HBO', 'better', 'known', 'dramas', 'including', 'Rome', 'Sopranos', 'as', 'well', 'lighter', 'fare', 'such', 'Ali', 'G', 'Show', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'Strangely', ""'d"", 'barely', 'even', 'heard', 'Wire', 'very', 'recently', 'when', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'taste', 'was', 'raving', 'then', 'had', ""n't"", 'given', 'Wire', 'chance', 'was', 'mistake', 'suggestion', 'purchased', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', 'was', 'quickly', 'hooked', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'completed', 'Season', 'Two', 'remain', 'very', 'much', 'story.Season', '2', 'Wire', 'new', 'case', 'new', 'focus', 'Baltimore', 'ports', 'union', 'dockworkers', 'smuggling', 'various', 'product', 'ashore', 'aspect', 'story', 'new', 'most', 'key', 'characters', 'including', 'significant', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'key', 'members', 'Barksdale', 'crew', 'course', 'Omar', 'remain', 'have', 'reduced', 'roles', 'Season', 'Two', 'also', 'number', 'new', 'characters', ""'re"", 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'crafted', 'believable', 'Season', 'One.This', 'likely', 'not', 'original', 'opinion', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'Wire', 'apart', 'realism', 'Granted', ""'m"", 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'nerd', 'who', 'lived', 'coddled', 'life', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'qualified', 'reviewer', 'comment', 'realism', 'show', 'drug', 'dealers', 'West', 'Baltimore', 'projects', 'realism', 'way', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'television', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'dramas', 'fail', ""n't"", 'dramatized', 'cops', 'look', 'generally', 'act', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'models', 'live', 'crappy', 'apartments', 'example', 'bad', 'guys', 'similarly', 'look', 'act', 'rational', 'participants', 'game', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'character', 'development', 'excellent', 'viewer', 'related', 'even', 'rooted', 'characters', 'sides', 'law', 'fact', 'are', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'sides.I', ""'d"", 'consider', 'Wire', 'one', 'best', 'dramas', 'recent', 'memory', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'continuing', 'series', ""'ve"", 'already', 'completed', 'presumably', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'one.As', 'ultimate', 'endorsement', 'will', 'be', 'continuing', 'Series', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ordering', 'Season', '3', 'Amazon', 'soon', 'submit', 'review']",N/A

869337,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B0006IUD9Y,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 2]","After Season One, which focused on a gang of Baltimore drug dealers, Season Two of The Wire shifts focus to the docks. We're introduced to a new cast of characters, from the tough Polish-American who runs the stevedores union to his feckless son and a creepy band of international criminals headed by ""The Greek"" who smuggle prostitutes from Eastern Europe as well as heroin.Many of the characters from Season One also reappear.It takes a couple of episodes to set up the premise for this season but once that's done the drama becomes riveting.What impresses me so much about this series is the panoramic view it takes, which reminds me of Tolstoy. Some characters are fundamentally trying to do the right thing but crushed by their circumstances. A few are just utterly evil, but even these are human with their foibles, their sense of humor, their loves, hatreds and desires. One crime boss attends economics classes at night school and tries to apply its lessons to his business. A hired assassin is an avid reader of Harpers and The New Yorker. And most characters are somewhere in the middle. They want to do good but sometimes it's just easier not to.Like all the best drama, there are moments of comedy and also tragedy, incredible surprises, brilliant performances and a steady ratcheting up of tensions.

869343,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0006IUD9Y,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","When The Wire started it was easy to see it as just another cop show, until its overwhelmingly high quality lifted it onto another level. After all, the narrative of Season 1 was simply that of cops versus drug dealers, with some murky political dealings on the side but these were left relatively unexplored. Season 2, however, shows creator David Simon's real plan: he is trying to craft the definitive portrayal of the turn-of-the-century American city. Like a Grand Theft Auto game, progressing onto Season 2 'unlocks' another chunk of the city, this time the docks and a new cast of characters, including Eastern European criminals, the unions and their families, and introduces an important new thread to the tapestry of the show.At the end of Season 1, Lt. Daniels' unit successfully cracked the Barksdale case, but political infighting between different police departments saw arrests made prematurely. Whilst Avon and D'Angelo were sent down, the evidence against Avon was flimsy and his time inside was limited, whilst back on the street the formidable Stringer Bell has been put in charge. Meanwhile, Daniels has been booted down to work in the evidence lock-up and McNulty has been sent over to the harbour patrol, to his extreme annoyance, whilst Freamon and Bunt are working in homicide. When McNulty fishes a body out of the harbour and port authority police officer Beadie Russell uncovers thirteen corpses in a freight container, the police's attention is turned to the harbour. This garners the interest of Commander Valchek, who is anxious to bring down the head of the stevedores' union, Frank Sobotka, after his union raises more cash for the local church's new stained-glass windows than Valchek's.Season 2 of The Wire sprawls slightly more than the first season, a result of the story having to incorporate a large number of new characters and locations whilst at the same time keeping tabs on the characters from Season 1. The project gangs, Stringer Bell, Omar and so forth are firmly on the back-burner for the season, with their story forming a subplot that clears up some loose ends from the first season and sets up the events of Season 3, where they return to prominence. Whilst characters such as Omar and Bubs get limited screen time as a result compared to the first year, at least they don't vanish altogether. Luckily, the new characters are a good match for the originals. Union politics and the gradual loss of American industry and hands-on labour are covered in a fascinating manner. Frank Sobotka (played by Chris Bauer) is the character whom the season's themes centre on, showing how an essentially decent man who values loyalty and fair play is gradually morally eroded, ground down by the city institutions and effectively destroyed, whilst the start of the same process is shown happening to his nephew Nicky (Pablo Schreiber). On the law-enforcement side, Amy Ryan makes a good impression as Beadie Russell, the working beat officer who is pulled into the detective unit formed to investigate the port situation and finds herself out of her depth, until she steps up. On the street side of things, the fascinating character of Brother Mouzone (Michael Potts) is introduced very late in the season, as more pieces are set up for the third year.The Wire remains dramatically intense, with several deaths (one in particular) and shocking plot developments meaning you don't know who is safe, or who can be trusted. The show's black sense of humour is retained (the entire investigation starts due to a personal feud between Valchek and Sobotka over whose union gives more money to their local church), the fascinating investigative tactics used by the police are expanded upon and the increasingly bleak portrayal of the modern American city is balanced by a few decent characters and moments of hope.The Wire: Season 2 (*****) takes slightly longer to get going than Season 1, but remains gripping, intelligent and adult television and the climax is much harsher.",5,Excellent,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,4007,"['When', 'Wire', 'started', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'as', 'just', 'cop', 'show', 'overwhelmingly', 'high', 'quality', 'lifted', 'level', 'narrative', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'simply', 'cops', 'drug', 'dealers', 'murky', 'political', 'dealings', 'side', 'were', 'left', 'relatively', 'unexplored', 'Season', '2', 'however', 'creator', 'David', 'Simon', 'real', 'plan', 'trying', 'craft', 'definitive', 'portrayal', 'turn-of-the-century', 'American', 'city', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', 'game', 'progressing', 'Season', '2', ""'unlocks"", 'chunk', 'city', 'time', 'docks', 'new', 'cast', 'characters', 'including', 'Eastern', 'European', 'criminals', 'unions', 'families', 'important', 'new', 'thread', 'tapestry', 'show.At', 'end', 'Season', '1', 'Lt.', 'Daniels', 'unit', 'successfully', 'cracked', 'Barksdale', 'case', 'political', 'infighting', 'different', 'police', 'departments', 'saw', 'arrests', 'made', 'prematurely', 'Whilst', 'Avon', ""D'Angelo"", 'were', 'sent', 'down', 'evidence', 'Avon', 'was', 'flimsy', 'time', 'inside', 'was', 'limited', 'back', 'street', 'formidable', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'been', 'put', 'charge', 'Meanwhile', 'Daniels', 'been', 'booted', 'down', 'work', 'evidence', 'lock-up', 'McNulty', 'been', 'sent', 'harbour', 'patrol', 'extreme', 'annoyance', 'whilst', 'Freamon', 'Bunt', 'are', 'working', 'homicide', 'When', 'McNulty', 'body', 'harbour', 'port', 'authority', 'police', 'officer', 'Beadie', 'Russell', 'uncovers', 'thirteen', 'corpses', 'freight', 'container', 'police', 'attention', 'turned', 'harbour', 'interest', 'Commander', 'Valchek', 'who', 'anxious', 'bring', 'down', 'head', 'stevedores', 'union', 'Frank', 'Sobotka', 'union', 'more', 'cash', 'local', 'church', 'new', 'stained-glass', 'windows', ""Valchek's.Season"", '2', 'Wire', 'slightly', 'more', 'first', 'season', 'result', 'story', 'having', 'incorporate', 'large', 'number', 'new', 'characters', 'locations', 'whilst', 'same', 'time', 'keeping', 'tabs', 'characters', 'Season', '1', 'project', 'gangs', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'Omar', 'so', 'forth', 'are', 'firmly', 'back-burner', 'season', 'story', 'forming', 'subplot', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'first', 'season', 'up', 'events', 'Season', '3', 'where', 'return', 'prominence', 'Whilst', 'characters', 'such', 'Omar', 'Bubs', 'get', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'result', 'compared', 'first', 'year', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'vanish', 'altogether', 'Luckily', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'match', 'originals', 'Union', 'politics', 'gradual', 'loss', 'American', 'industry', 'hands-on', 'labour', 'are', 'covered', 'fascinating', 'manner', 'Frank', 'Sobotka', 'played', 'Chris', 'Bauer', 'character', 'whom', 'season', 'themes', 'centre', 'showing', 'how', 'essentially', 'decent', 'man', 'who', 'loyalty', 'fair', 'play', 'gradually', 'morally', 'eroded', 'ground', 'down', 'city', 'institutions', 'effectively', 'destroyed', 'start', 'same', 'process', 'shown', 'happening', 'nephew', 'Nicky', 'Pablo', 'Schreiber', 'law-enforcement', 'side', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'good', 'impression', 'Beadie', 'Russell', 'working', 'beat', 'officer', 'who', 'pulled', 'detective', 'unit', 'formed', 'investigate', 'port', 'situation', 'depth', 'up', 'street', 'side', 'things', 'fascinating', 'character', 'Brother', 'Mouzone', 'Michael', 'Potts', 'introduced', 'very', 'late', 'season', 'more', 'pieces', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'third', 'year.The', 'Wire', 'dramatically', 'intense', 'several', 'deaths', 'one', 'particular', 'shocking', 'plot', 'developments', 'meaning', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'safe', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'show', 'black', 'sense', 'humour', 'retained', 'entire', 'investigation', 'starts', 'due', 'personal', 'feud', 'Valchek', 'Sobotka', 'union', 'more', 'money', 'local', 'church', 'fascinating', 'investigative', 'tactics', 'used', 'police', 'are', 'expanded', 'increasingly', 'bleak', 'portrayal', 'modern', 'American', 'city', 'balanced', 'few', 'decent', 'characters', 'moments', 'hope.The', 'Wire', 'Season', '2', '*****', 'slightly', 'longer', 'get', 'going', 'Season', '1', 'gripping', 'intelligent', 'adult', 'television', 'climax', 'much', 'harsher']",N/A

869348,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B0006IUD9Y,Brian Maitland,"[0, 1]","I guess it's a harsh statement but following the comings and goings of stevedores (longshoremen to those of us out West) did not grip me as much as Season One where the drug dealers of West Baltmore were the focus.I loved the way they started Season Two with McNulty on shore patrol which helped lead the series into this new world. It plods a bit as I found the stevedores not at all really likable or fascinatingly drawn personalities. They basically came across as lumps. Maybe that's what they are but the union boss Frank Sobotka is the least likely lead character to drive this season. He just seems ""there"" and that's about it.Worse is his son, Ziggy, who was just plain obnoxious and with that scrawny body of his seems a very unlikely stevedore. Although (spolier alert!) something Ziggy does starts the whole house of cards to come apart at the seams, it seems a tad out of the blue. Even so, what was the point of the duck Ziggy buys?You do get the ""assemble the squad"" slant a few episodes in to be again led by Daniels and you know the story is going to get rolling from there. Also, the last two episodes is where things really grip you and the ""ship hits the plans"" to loosely paraphrase that timeworn cliche. Those episodes saved this season from being a run of the mill one to one where I am looking forward to Season Three and seeing how it all works esp. regarding Barksdale and Bell's relationship.Also, in Season Two music plays a huge part in setting the scenes and shows the difference between black (hip hop/rap) and white (alt rock) cultures of today. The choice of ""Love Child"" on the jukebox in one scene at the stevedores' hangout bar to rag on Ziggy was brilliant.Lastly, McNulty is not used as much as he was in Season One and being basically a peripheral character may have been a unique choice but he was vastly underused. At least the scenes with the stickup artist Omar still are well worth watching and he remains the strangest moral compass of all when it comes to right and wrong...at least in his world.It all came down to the fact that the world of the docks was just not as interesting as that in the towers and low rises from Season One.",4,white folks just ain't as interesting,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,2178,"['guess', 'harsh', 'statement', 'following', 'comings', 'goings', 'stevedores', 'longshoremen', 'West', 'did', 'not', 'grip', 'as', 'much', 'Season', 'One', 'where', 'drug', 'dealers', 'West', 'Baltmore', 'were', 'focus.I', 'loved', 'way', 'started', 'Season', 'Two', 'McNulty', 'shore', 'patrol', 'helped', 'lead', 'series', 'new', 'world', 'bit', 'found', 'stevedores', 'not', 'really', 'likable', 'fascinatingly', 'drawn', 'personalities', 'basically', 'came', 'lumps', 'Maybe', 'what', 'are', 'union', 'Frank', 'Sobotka', 'least', 'likely', 'lead', 'character', 'drive', 'season', 'just', 'it.Worse', 'son', 'Ziggy', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'obnoxious', 'scrawny', 'body', 'very', 'unlikely', 'stevedore', 'spolier', 'alert', 'something', 'Ziggy', 'starts', 'whole', 'house', 'cards', 'come', 'apart', 'seams', 'tad', 'blue', 'Even', 'so', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'duck', 'Ziggy', 'do', 'get', 'assemble', 'squad', 'slant', 'few', 'episodes', 'be', 'again', 'led', 'Daniels', 'know', 'story', 'going', 'get', 'rolling', 'there', 'Also', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'where', 'things', 'really', 'grip', 'ship', 'plans', 'loosely', 'paraphrase', 'timeworn', 'cliche', 'episodes', 'saved', 'season', 'being', 'run', 'mill', 'one', 'one', 'where', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'Season', 'Three', 'seeing', 'how', 'esp', 'regarding', 'Barksdale', 'Bell', 'relationship.Also', 'Season', 'Two', 'music', 'huge', 'part', 'setting', 'scenes', 'difference', 'black', 'hip', 'hop/rap', 'white', 'alt', 'rock', 'today', 'choice', 'Love', 'Child', 'jukebox', 'one', 'scene', 'stevedores', 'hangout', 'bar', 'rag', 'Ziggy', 'was', 'brilliant.Lastly', 'McNulty', 'not', 'used', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'Season', 'One', 'being', 'basically', 'peripheral', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'unique', 'choice', 'was', 'vastly', 'underused', 'least', 'scenes', 'stickup', 'artist', 'Omar', 'still', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'strangest', 'moral', 'compass', 'when', 'right', 'wrong', 'least', 'world.It', 'came', 'down', 'fact', 'world', 'docks', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'towers', 'low', 'rises', 'Season', 'One']",N/A

At best it would end up being a secret santa present or a rotating loan between friends and family. The Wire is different and actually worth the investment. The second season at first seems like a departure from the first season as the focus is squarely on the Baltimore dock workers. Similar to the first season you have to endure a few ""slow"" episodes at first, which are necessary to set the stage for what is to come. The plot of the second season itself becomes increasingly interesting as you move through the season and you are introduced to political characters who really become prominent in later seasons. As with the first season, the beauty of the show lies in the careful character development and the attention to detail. There are no extra characters who appear in one episode never to be seen again - even the seemingly least important background character will come up again later in the season and again in subsequent seasons. More importantly there are no filler episodes in the season - each one is important to the plot of the season, the overall plot of the series and to the development of major and minor characters.I wouldn't consider myself a tv junkie or a dedicated fan of crime dramas like Law & Order, but this series is simply too good to miss out on. Watching the season again, particularly after having watched the subsequent seasons, you gain an even greater appreciation for the character development and you pick up on a ton of details that didn't seem important the first time through.",5,"Still the best series of all time, but a notch below Season 1",1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,1661,"['Buying', 'television', 'series', 'DVD', 'generally', 'wasted', 'investment', 'once', 'watch', 'series', 'rarely', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'best', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'secret', 'santa', 'present', 'rotating', 'loan', 'friends', 'family', 'Wire', 'different', 'actually', 'investment', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'departure', 'first', 'season', 'focus', 'squarely', 'Baltimore', 'dock', 'workers', 'Similar', 'first', 'season', 'have', 'endure', 'few', 'slow', 'episodes', 'first', 'are', 'necessary', 'set', 'stage', 'what', 'come', 'plot', 'second', 'season', 'increasingly', 'interesting', 'move', 'season', 'are', 'introduced', 'political', 'characters', 'who', 'really', 'become', 'prominent', 'later', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'beauty', 'show', 'careful', 'character', 'development', 'attention', 'detail', 'are', 'extra', 'characters', 'who', 'appear', 'one', 'episode', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'even', 'seemingly', 'least', 'important', 'background', 'character', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'again', 'later', 'season', 'again', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'More', 'importantly', 'are', 'filler', 'season', 'one', 'important', 'plot', 'season', 'overall', 'plot', 'series', 'development', 'major', 'minor', 'characters.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'tv', 'junkie', 'dedicated', 'fan', 'crime', 'dramas', 'Law', 'Order', 'series', 'simply', 'too', 'good', 'miss', 'out', 'Watching', 'season', 'again', 'particularly', 'having', 'watched', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'gain', 'even', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'character', 'development', 'pick', 'up', 'ton', 'details', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'important', 'first', 'time']",N/A

With the huge cast of characters they have to work with it's amazing there's not an off performance nor ever a scene that doesn't feel in place. Everything builds on what we know about the City of Baltimore and the wide variety of characters from the first season, introduces a whole new slew of characters, and it feels authentic every step of the way. If perfect television exsists this is it.The thing I like best about Season 2 is how it builds on our emotion and familiarity with the characters we know and shows these characters from sides we haven't seen before. I was really involved with these character and cared about the new case that comes about, even as almost no one is without their flaws and misdeeds. I sympathised with the cops in dealing with the higher ups sometimes more concerned with political motives or vendetas than they are about justice. Even in the streets, while the characters may not be as sympathetic, I really got involved with their situations, and with the streets not being directly connected to the central case of the season the conflict becomes more of a moral one than one with the police. The ports, which we have no famaliarity from the first season and are a big part of the central case of this season, are introduced seemlessly, and the characters are ones than many will come to care and relate deeply to: the struggling working man. I couldn't pick a favorite character if I wanted to.I'm not going to spoil anything here. Watching it for yourself it an experience you won't forget. It works on emtion, on comedy, on drama, and on suspense. In no show I've ever seen, not even the Sopranos, has all four of those elements been done as well as it is here.

About two years ago, after constantly being told how great it was both in real life and on television/movie forums, I picked up the DVD box set. Watched the first two episodes and it just didn't grab me, so I stopped watching. I eventually just gave it away to someone I know who already loves the show.So the other day I was a bored and, for the simple reason I couldn't really find anything else to watch, decided to try it again since it was free on Prime. By the end of the first season, which I watched in two days, I was floored and officially hooked. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. After the first episode of season 2, I was confused and frankly agitated. Who the f--- are these people? How are dock workers in any way going to be as interesting as the hardened thugs in season 1? And I already missed the gang (McNulty & co.) being together. I was about to just give up again but decided to weather the storm.The only reason I'm writing this review is to tell new fans (like me) to stay with it if you have no idea what the hell is going on and want to give up. Not only does season 2 get better, I think it might actually surpass the first season in quality. This show's got balls to do an almost complete 180 in its second year and demand its viewers to be patient all over again. Stick with it. By episode 4, everything starts falling into place. And it just gets better from there. And better.To think, seasons 3 and 4 are said to be the apex of The Wire. Can't wait. At first I wasn't sure this show would equal or, dare I say, eclipse The Sopranos, a show I've watched and rewatched countless times. Now? I'm a believer.

869366,A1FF2KROA1D87,B0006IUD9Y,Denise P,"[2, 2]","One of the best series on TV.  Runs at least neck and neck, I think better then the Sopranos.The characters are fascinating and complex.  Some of the best story telling and acting I've seen in a long time.  The characters personalities are compelling and captivating.  You just get hooked.I was a Soprano's snob.  I just felt it was the best thing on TV and safely tucked away in Jersey so I didn't have to think about the crimes affecting my life.Before I viewed The Wire, I guess I didn't want to be bothered with the whole urban crime thing, especially so close to home.  I felt like what on earth could these kids, with pants hanging down to there knees and rap music blasting have to say that's intelligent?I found that the crime hierarchy is so much like the Sopranos, organized to the point of being genius.  I found just like the Sopranos there is a Family like element, but a brutality that is unbelievable.There are characters you will love but know they are paid to kill.  Characters you find ultimately ruthless almost with animal cunning.  Then you will find some characters eloquent in there lifestyle and speech.Among the characters in Season one, a young dealer who lives in a condemned building with about 6 little elementary school kids.  He buys food for them and sends them off to school.  He's lost with no parents like those kids.  The show isn't preachy in any way.  It just is.Also The Wire is about both sides of the coin.  The police officers, politics, and lifestyles are just as riveting.  Cops that drink too much, have an awful family life, fighting with ex's, or not giving a damn.The Second Season of The Wire is no exception.

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[6, 6]","Each year, so many people whine that The Wire doesn't get Emmy nominations, it threatens to become the Lexus of topics to whine about.  I felt that when I finished watching the extraordinary second season of The Wire, and in particular about the performance of Chris Bauer, but I realized what I was really feeling is the sadness and fear that such brilliant work will go unvalidated, that feeling that it is simply the truth that this is one of the finest series every created, and it just takes a few ""experts"" to agree with me to make that true.  We'll leave aside the obvious argument about the accuracy of The Emmys, and I'll just mention why I know I'm right.  Season 2 takes a couple episodes to warm up to - truly a product of season 1's perfection, a change in scope is not initially welcomed - as, in presenting the inner workings and corruption of the Baltimore port takes a few episodes to even understand.  Once you do, though, you realize the extraordinary human story at its center - this season, there are the cops and drug dealers of season 1, but the true spark is in Dock Foreman Frank Sabotka (Bauer), his obnoxious, lanky, wannabe son Ziggy (James Ransone), and his cooler, wiser meathead nephew Nick (Pablo Schreiber).  Frank is being investigated by Major Valchek (Al Brown), ""because he's an a--hole,"" which is to say, for nothing, but when 13 sex-trafficked Eastern European hookers show up dead in a dock canister, his whole world of smuggling comes under scrutiny.  It's that scrutiny that makes The Wire so intoxicating - Frank is far more human and varied than Valchek anyway, and the interplay of that younger generation (leading to one stunning, frustratingly human turn after another) gives it as much humanity as relevance, so much so that the structure of society seems to be equally as indicted as the personalities at its center.  Did I mention that those cops and dealers are just as fascinating as they've ever been also?  One halfway-point shock killing of a beloved first season character shows just how risky this show will be to make its stories true.  To pull off as much as The Wire does in 12 episodes takes as much vision as it does skill and bravery - it is, quite simply, the height of creative expression.",5,"""Business, always business""",1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,2254,"['year', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'whine', 'Wire', ""n't"", 'get', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'become', 'Lexus', 'topics', 'whine', 'felt', 'when', 'finished', 'watching', 'extraordinary', 'second', 'season', 'Wire', 'particular', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Bauer', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'fear', 'such', 'brilliant', 'work', 'will', 'go', 'unvalidated', 'feeling', 'simply', 'truth', 'one', 'finest', 'series', 'created', 'just', 'few', 'experts', 'agree', 'make', 'true', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'aside', 'obvious', 'argument', 'accuracy', 'Emmys', ""'ll"", 'just', 'mention', 'why', 'know', ""'m"", 'right', 'Season', '2', 'couple', 'warm', 'up', 'truly', 'product', 'season', '1', 'perfection', 'change', 'scope', 'not', 'initially', 'welcomed', 'presenting', 'inner', 'workings', 'corruption', 'Baltimore', 'port', 'few', 'episodes', 'even', 'understand', 'Once', 'do', 'though', 'realize', 'extraordinary', 'human', 'story', 'center', 'season', 'are', 'cops', 'drug', 'dealers', 'season', '1', 'true', 'spark', 'Dock', 'Foreman', 'Frank', 'Sabotka', 'Bauer', 'obnoxious', 'lanky', 'wannabe', 'son', 'Ziggy', 'James', 'Ransone', 'cooler', 'wiser', 'meathead', 'nephew', 'Nick', 'Pablo', 'Schreiber', 'Frank', 'being', 'investigated', 'Major', 'Valchek', 'Al', 'Brown', 'hole', 'say', 'nothing', 'when', '13', 'sex-trafficked', 'Eastern', 'European', 'hookers', 'show', 'up', 'dead', 'dock', 'canister', 'whole', 'world', 'smuggling', 'scrutiny', 'scrutiny', 'Wire', 'intoxicating', 'Frank', 'far', 'more', 'human', 'varied', 'Valchek', 'anyway', 'interplay', 'younger', 'generation', 'leading', 'one', 'stunning', 'frustratingly', 'human', 'turn', 'much', 'humanity', 'relevance', 'so', 'much', 'structure', 'society', 'be', 'equally', 'as', 'indicted', 'personalities', 'center', 'Did', 'mention', 'cops', 'dealers', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'fascinating', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'also', 'One', 'halfway-point', 'shock', 'killing', 'beloved', 'first', 'season', 'character', 'just', 'how', 'risky', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'make', 'stories', 'true', 'pull', 'off', 'as', 'much', 'Wire', '12', 'episodes', 'as', 'much', 'vision', 'skill', 'bravery', 'quite', 'simply', 'height', 'creative', 'expression']",N/A

869373,A312DJ13DFEU96,B0006IUD9Y,"Evan Bernick ""Benny Blanco""","[5, 11]","It's uncanny how ""The Wire"" has progressed in a fashion similar to that of the Godfather trilogy. The first season, like the first Godfather film, is the most intense, the most immediate, the most intimate. The second season is more detached, has a broader scope and is more ambitious, and though well-crafted and intelligent, keeps the viewer slightly at a distance. The third season, well, it's barely worth talking about, as David Simon uses the characters as mouthpieces to give voice to his own political leanings in a distracting fashion and the storylines become increasingly improbable. Seriously, does anybody believe that Omar would have survived for that long robbing dealers in the projects? And whose brilliant idea was it to introduce the cartoon cutout hitman, Brother Muozone? But I digress.Don't misunderstand, the second season of ""the Wire"" is highly effective, as McNulty and co. find themselves pursuing a different breed of criminality; one that, in contrast to Barksdale's crew, has no loyalty, no values other than monetary values, and no moral compunction whatsoever. It's telling that when the cops finally crack down on them, they want to turn each other in but don't know enough about one another to do so. The central villains in season 2 are much like Stringer Bell in season one; they destroy the lives of those beneath them, and beat the system at the same time. The lower level guys, like Frank Sabotka, his son, and his nephew, don't stand a chance. Neither, on the Barksdale front, does D'Angelo, whose lament that ""It don't matter that some fool say he different"" sums up the situation concisely. Men like Bell, Vondas, and the Greek will win, while the Wallaces, the Ziggy's, and the D'Angelo's will eventually do themselves in.This is powerful stuff, and it's well orchestrated and plotted. On the cops' side, things get a little more uneven. McNulty and Bunk are still hilarious together-- McNulty's feud with Rawls had me rolling. Unfortunately, Kima and Cheryl's subplot becomes positively annoying (I can't stand Cheryl), and Beatrice Russell, the dock policewoman, is an unfortunate screenwriter's device; she tells the audience what they should be feeling at every possible opportunity.And Omar, well... he's outstayed his welcome. And the lesbian stick-up girls he teams up with, what the hell? This isn't ""Queer as Folk,"" damnit. There's some overrepresentation going on here. The kids from the PJ's should have whacked Omar in Season one when he rolled up on them in broad daylight and turned his back to them. But I digress...If you're used to network TV, the first two seasons of ""The Wire"" will shock you. I'm talking about ""The Godfather"" because this stuff merits comparison. But make no mistake about it; you want to stick to Season one and two, especially season one.

869375,A248YV1PRDUFV0,B0006IUD9Y,Frugalshopper,"[4, 16]","I just watched the second season of The Wire and while I loved the first season and look forwad to what appears to be a return to the more cohesive formula that marked the first season, season two was found to be lacking.  The pacing and character development is disjointed, and the new additions to the cast added little to the overall enemble.  Specifically, the charcter of McNulty is floating aimlessly thorughout the first part of the season, while we are still shown the drug dealing crew from the first season, they appear to be little more than filler to keep the viewer interested and hoping that something better is to come until a little more than half way through the season, and the white, female officer who comes in via the dock story is so bland and of so little importance, there were whole scenes with her where I wondered why her character was there.  As for the primary focus of the story this season, the corruption on the docks, none of the characters really came across as being strong enough to be involved in any of their criminal enterprises.  One character in particular , Ziggy, should have been nothing more than a one episode story arch where he is introduced, we see what a scummy, racist loser he is, and he is killed.  Because of his drug and dock connections, this might have been a more interesting and sustainable storyline than the story of 14 dead hookers from Russia, whose ultimat resolution was just as bland and insignificant as the story that spwaned the resolution.  At the end, my only thought was I sat through 12 hours for THIS.  The saving grace are the strong acting performances from the oficers of season one and the dealers (especially Stringer and Omar who are clearly on a collision course).  If the goal was to show that there is more to crime in Baltimore, than black drug dealers, the writers could have focused on police, or political corruption, or if they still wanted the dock theme, really deal with the role the white controlled docks have and continue to play in sustaining the drug scurge of the inner-city.

Episode 1 has the best hook of any episode, ending with the discovery of 14 dead women in a container box.  As with each new season, the focus shifts to a new failed institution.  That institution here is the stevedores' union on Baltimore's harbor.The cast in season 2 expands dramatically, as we are introduced to several members of the stevedore's union and the members of a shadowy criminal syndicate smuggling drugs and other contraband in through the ports.  The Sobotka family--father and local union president, Frank; Frank's competent and ambitious nephew, Nick, and Frank's bungling son, Ziggy--is the central focus in the union storylines.  The old police team from season 1 has been dispersed.  McNulty and Daniels have been banished to the city marine and evidence units, respectively, to suffer for their sins.  Carver is a sergeant in the Southwestern district, Greggs has a desk job, and Freamon is back in homicide after an absence of 13 years, 4 months.  Predictably, the old team is eventually reunited after Frank Sobotka crosses Major Valchek.Baltimore is a city where the north washes up against the south, and the emphasis on the stevedores helps highlight the divide between the northern culture of police and dockworkers dominated by white ethnics and the southern culture of a drug game dominated by blacks.  Police officers mourn with an alcohol-soaked wake at the local police bar; gang members mourn by bringing an excessive amount of food over to the deceased's home.The updated opening sequence uses the same theme song--Way Down in the Hole--but sung by Tom Waits himself and with clips from the new season.DVD extras include: a series index, commentary on episode 6 by Dominic West (McNulty) and Michael K.

One can also see it as an illustration of American decline.The port is a hotbed of crime, with illegal importation of women from Eastern Europe for prostitution, with drugs via the French Connection, with theft of goods from incoming containers, or theft of entire containers, and exportation of stolen goods, such as luxury cars. Plus local drugs distribution troubles. Plus the occasional murder, like here the death of 14 women destined for a Baltimore brothel, but suffocated in a container.Heavily involved in all port crime is the head of the local union, Frank Sobotka. The man is a kind of Polish Robin Hood: a criminal, but all for the good of the union and the workers. While he is undoubtedly involved in crime, he is still a 'good guy', not out for personal enrichment. The income from crime goes towards greasing politicians, and to welfare payments, like support of accident victims or unemployed. Like all men with a cause, he fails as a family man and loses his son.The sad fact is: the port is in decline. Sobotka's union members hardly find enough work to stay out of trouble. Former industrial buildings are standing empty or are used for other things. It is an industrial waste land.In Sobotka's words: we used to export all kinds of stuff from this port.

Steckfus,"[4, 4]","I'm not going to give an episode by episode synopsis of this masterful season of what is the greatest show ever aired on television, in my opinion.  However, in the view of this reviewer, this is finest season David Simon and Ed Burns wrote.I've seen the negative reviews and have heard many people complain that Season 2 is ""slower,"" ""takes longer to develop,"" and ""the characters aren't as interesting.""  The reality is that each of these individuals along with each of the reviewers on this site that are saying this have never been to Baltimore.  I've lived in Baltimore my entire life and was born here.  My family to this day runs a small manufacturing business in the steel industry and this season pretty much captures each side of the true Baltimore - this is a blue collar manufacturing and port town plagued by heroin, disease, prostitution, and perhaps the highest murder per capita rate in the entire world (if you don't count Detroit).  And that is what The Wire strives to achieve.....this isn't just a dramatic cops and drug dealers show....this is epic about the city of Baltimore and here we witness the decline of the city's industries that have long supported its communities (along with the drugs, murder, gangbangers, ect.)At the beginning of the first episode when McNulty is on the boat, they go by the former Bethlehem Steel Sparrow's Point plant.  McNulty says his father worked there but was laid off.  That is the theme - The deindustrialization of this town, and hence, our country.In my opinion, Frank Sobotka is possibly the greatest character of the entire show (except for Omar).  He has the responsibility to so many men at the port but doesn't have the work to give them so he has to resort to bringing in contraband for the greeks.  By the way, the prostitutes in the barrels and the giant drug bust REALLY HAPPENED here several years ago and there IS a large Greek community here (even though the greek wasn't really greek).  Also, another perk for me here is NO MARLOW.....Stringer Bell is the perfect villain here, an Adam Smith-following, enterprising, kill everyone in his way, straight up businessman.I'll stop there but if you want to really witness every side of Baltimore and really know what this town is about, look no further.",5,The Finest Season Of The Wire,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,2274,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'episode', 'episode', 'synopsis', 'masterful', 'season', 'what', 'greatest', 'show', 'ever', 'aired', 'television', 'opinion', 'However', 'view', 'reviewer', 'finest', 'season', 'David', 'Simon', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'wrote.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'negative', 'reviews', 'have', 'heard', 'many', 'people', 'complain', 'Season', '2', 'slower', 'longer', 'develop', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'reality', 'individuals', 'reviewers', 'site', 'are', 'saying', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Baltimore', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Baltimore', 'entire', 'life', 'was', 'born', 'here', 'family', 'day', 'small', 'manufacturing', 'business', 'steel', 'industry', 'season', 'pretty', 'much', 'captures', 'side', 'true', 'Baltimore', 'blue', 'collar', 'manufacturing', 'port', 'town', 'plagued', 'heroin', 'disease', 'prostitution', 'perhaps', 'highest', 'murder', 'capita', 'rate', 'entire', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'Detroit', 'what', 'Wire', 'strives', 'achieve', '..this', ""n't"", 'just', 'dramatic', 'cops', 'drug', 'dealers', 'show', '.this', 'epic', 'city', 'Baltimore', 'here', 'witness', 'decline', 'city', 'industries', 'have', 'long', 'supported', 'communities', 'drugs', 'murder', 'gangbangers', 'ect', 'beginning', 'first', 'episode', 'when', 'McNulty', 'boat', 'go', 'former', 'Bethlehem', 'Steel', 'Sparrow', 'Point', 'plant', 'McNulty', 'father', 'worked', 'was', 'laid', 'off', 'theme', 'deindustrialization', 'town', 'hence', 'country.In', 'opinion', 'Frank', 'Sobotka', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'character', 'entire', 'show', 'Omar', 'responsibility', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'port', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', 'give', 'so', 'resort', 'bringing', 'contraband', 'greeks', 'way', 'prostitutes', 'barrels', 'giant', 'drug', 'bust', 'REALLY', 'HAPPENED', 'here', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'large', 'Greek', 'community', 'here', 'even', 'greek', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'greek', 'Also', 'perk', 'here', 'NO', 'MARLOW', '..Stringer', 'Bell', 'perfect', 'villain', 'here', 'Adam', 'Smith-following', 'enterprising', 'kill', 'everyone', 'way', 'straight', 'up', 'businessman.I', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'there', 'want', 'really', 'witness', 'side', 'Baltimore', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'town', 'look', 'further']",N/A

In and of itself, amazing!. So kudos to the producers/directors, script writers and actors. Here's my concerns with Season II.Like Gershwyn's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" or Bernstein's ""West Side Story,"" does anything that follows Season I become less than the brilliant initial tale? Does Season I become the high water mark which can never be surpassed? I don't know.Wire 2 is better. It's filmed more seamlessly, the stories are related but seemingly develop independently of each other. So why am I holding my breath?The success of 24, with which this must be compared, seems to have some differences. 24 recycles 'some' characters, saves some for later shows, and kills off some characters. Some characters are shelved for reasons unbeknownst to us, the viewers. So what we get are new, important faces. And the characters do have baggage from previous shows, (Tony's drinking; Michelle's climb to the top), but for the most part, the personal issues are different. Jack's got anger issues, then he's an addict. Well, that was unexpected.Here in Wire 2, McNulty's still a brilliant drunk. Flash. That doesn't work anymore. The gifted Irish poet throwing up on his shoes . . . tedious. Mrs. (former) McNulty, well sure now she doesn't trust the old catting Mr. (Det.) M. Why should she? He sleeps around and . . . throws up on his shoes. Even the bedroom scene where she goes back to Dominic West, (which maybe the hottest ever filmed for television), is kind of silly, almost pandering to base tastes, thrown in to show a little nudity, an expression of more broken promises that considering the trivializing of relationships by McNulty, are extremely well deserved.And Chris Bauer, a brilliant gifted actor, is a union boss, not an out of work Shakespearean actor. When he pines to Pablo Schreiber (Nick) about the loss of dignity, the loading and unloading of ships on the backs of men building America, and 'this band of brothers,' (you almost want to hear the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sing ""America The Beautiful,"") he's still a union man. He lives for the union, not to strut his foolish player upon the stage. If he had that much introspection, you wonder, maybe he wouldn''t be involved with the mob? I can't imagine Jimmy Hoffa saying ""if you cut me, do I not bleed.""Even Greggs who was extraordinary in I is forced to play the role of the expecting husband. She does so, well, but why are we forced to watch it? It's almost comedic. Herc and Carver are reduced to Rocky's Paulie role (""I don't get no respect."")Is it still the best on TV? Yes. By far. Is it a victory for HBO? Yes, by far. But it seems to be headed for a serial instead of each season being a new season. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",5,"""You're still the one . . .

And there are some Bad Men behind the scenes with sinister foreign accents and sinister monikers like ""The Greek"" who calmly assure the people they torture that they have their solemn word that they'll be spared if they offer the information they're being tortured for but then have them garroted anyway. You'd think this is ""Die Hard"".And then the acting is often ridiculously over-the-top. ""Season One"" was remarkably understated in this regard with exemplary performances throughout but here various characters vie for who can chew the scenery with more aplomb. It's more and more evident that the central character, McNulty, is miscast: Dominic West far more readily suggests that he'd be more naturally attuned to the pages of ""Gentleman's Quarterly"" than as a sleep-in-his-clothes self-destructive (but dedicated) cop; his drunk scene is about as unconvincing as it gets. And although many of the characters are clearly meant to be eccentrically loveable, I have to admit I find them irritating. The writing is contrived, attempting to capture the Poetry Of The Streets but failing ignominiously. Of course there is ""earthy"" humour in abundance but it continually falls flat; to compensate, we are shown lots of reaction shots of people laughing uproariously to let us know humour WAS intended. In fact, there's a constant straining for effect rather than natural story-telling. It's as if the writers are vainly shooting the plot up with adrenalin when it is so plainly dead.Still, it makes me appreciate Season One all the more........",2,Weak continuation of the First Series,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,2007,"['Season', 'One', 'Wire', 'was', 'riveting', 'follow-up', 'bore', 'comparison.First', 'problem', 'feeble', 'plot', 'loosely', 'based', 'Baltimore', 'docks', 'never', 'traction', 'continually', 'scratching', 'something', 'latch', 'never', 'coming', 'close', 'intensity', 'concentration', 'First', 'Series', 'Secondly', 'even', 'semblance', 'plot', 'unconvincing', 'surprisingly', 'conventional', 'Guess', 'what', 'dockers', 'are', 'ripping', 'off', 'containers', 'are', 'Bad', 'Men', 'scenes', 'sinister', 'foreign', 'accents', 'sinister', 'monikers', 'Greek', 'who', 'calmly', 'assure', 'people', 'torture', 'have', 'solemn', 'word', ""'ll"", 'be', 'spared', 'offer', 'information', ""'re"", 'being', 'tortured', 'then', 'have', 'garroted', 'anyway', ""'d"", 'think', 'Die', 'Hard', '.And', 'then', 'acting', 'often', 'ridiculously', 'over-the-top', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'remarkably', 'understated', 'regard', 'exemplary', 'performances', 'here', 'various', 'characters', 'vie', 'who', 'can', 'chew', 'scenery', 'more', 'aplomb', 'more', 'more', 'evident', 'central', 'character', 'McNulty', 'miscast', 'Dominic', 'West', 'far', 'more', 'readily', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'naturally', 'attuned', 'pages', 'Gentleman', 'Quarterly', 'sleep-in-his-clothes', 'self-destructive', 'dedicated', 'cop', 'drunk', 'scene', 'as', 'unconvincing', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'eccentrically', 'loveable', 'have', 'admit', 'find', 'irritating', 'writing', 'contrived', 'attempting', 'capture', 'Poetry', 'Streets', 'failing', 'ignominiously', 'course', 'earthy', 'humour', 'abundance', 'continually', 'flat', 'compensate', 'are', 'shown', 'lots', 'reaction', 'shots', 'people', 'laughing', 'uproariously', 'let', 'know', 'humour', 'WAS', 'intended', 'fact', 'constant', 'straining', 'effect', 'rather', 'natural', 'story-telling', 'writers', 'are', 'vainly', 'shooting', 'plot', 'up', 'adrenalin', 'when', 'so', 'plainly', 'dead.Still', 'appreciate', 'Season', 'One', 'more', '..']",N/A

Both are interesting and quite frankly unusual subjects for television that are written with what seems like a reasonable about of knowledge.Again, the trigger for the investigation is both pathetic and very realistic. A dispute between a union leader and a police captain over whose donated window will be where in the church turns into a police investigation of the union. As in the first season, it captures how little the police often know and how aribitrary the reasons for starting investigations can be. Its also good at showing why investigations of drug organizations above street level are so difficult.The only things I can really fault are that the show drifts too much into moral lessons. The show has the son and another realtive of the union boss get into trouble. Then it has a heavy-handed message trying to blame the union head for their personal corruption.

The bar scene with Ziggy and the stevedores in the first episode of Season 2, for example, is one of the funniest pieces of writing I've seen anywhere - novels, films, and theater included.  David Simon and Ed Burns together created the storyline for the entire series so every episode is meaningful to the overall arc - there are no ""standalone"" episodes that have been farmed out to other writers (as with other shows) that turn out to be interesting detours but do not evolve the main characters or plot.Comparisons with ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Godfather"" just make sense.  This is a show that can enjoyed casually on its surface but also rewards close viewing for those who wish to explore its many layers.  This show is so well-conceived and executed that it could be a topic of literary study in a college course - no kidding.On top of all this, the cinematography is simply gorgeous.Spend twelve hours with ""The Wire"" and in all likelihood some of these characters, scenes, images, and plot twists will remain with you the rest of your life.",5,Writing That's So Good You May Want To Turn On The Subtitles,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,1676,"['Wire', 'so', 'good', 'essentially', '12-hour', 'film', 'be', 'conveniently', 'divided', '1-hour', 'segments.Watching', 'DVD', 'one', 'episode', 'right', 'can', 'be', 'transcendent', 'experience', 'akin', 'getting', 'swept', 'away', 'great', 'novel', 'where', 'are', 'completely', 'transported', 'world', 'lose', 'fascinating', 'universe', 'vivid', 'characters', 'totally', 'absorbing', 'plot', 'unpredictably', 'time.Another', 'bonus', 'watching', 'Wire', 'DVD', 'can', 'literally', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'writing', 'series', 'just', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'certainly', 'did', 'entirety', 'bar', 'scene', 'Ziggy', 'stevedores', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', '2', 'example', 'one', 'funniest', 'pieces', 'writing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anywhere', 'novels', 'films', 'theater', 'included', 'David', 'Simon', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'together', 'created', 'storyline', 'entire', 'series', 'so', 'episode', 'meaningful', 'overall', 'arc', 'are', 'standalone', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'farmed', 'other', 'writers', 'other', 'shows', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'interesting', 'detours', 'do', 'not', 'evolve', 'main', 'characters', 'plot.Comparisons', 'Sopranos', 'Godfather', 'just', 'make', 'sense', 'show', 'can', 'enjoyed', 'casually', 'surface', 'also', 'rewards', 'close', 'viewing', 'who', 'wish', 'explore', 'many', 'layers', 'show', 'so', 'well-conceived', 'executed', 'could', 'be', 'topic', 'literary', 'study', 'college', 'course', 'kidding.On', 'top', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'gorgeous.Spend', 'twelve', 'hours', 'Wire', 'likelihood', 'characters', 'scenes', 'images', 'plot', 'twists', 'will', 'remain', 'rest', 'life']",N/A

I commend the Amazon reviewer (above) on his synopsis of the show and nothing more need be added in terms of plot detail or character explanation. He sums it up very well.The best parts of this show, I think, are as follows:1) Nothing comes easy. Unlike an episode of CSI or Law & Order, which wrap up in 40 minutes, it takes an entire series of The Wire to reach a conclusion.2) Shades within characters. Whether the characters are good or bad, in 'The Wire', we see all sides. The 'bad guys' have their redeeming features; the 'good guys' show stunning flaws.3) Brilliant, tight writing. An enormous cast is expertly choreographed in a sprawling plot that, admittedly, does take six episodes to really 'take off'. For patient and intelligent viewers though, this is part of the fun.4) Nothing is 'sensational'. There's nothing that 'solves' the case immediately; there's no slow-mo meaningful shots to emotional music (ala Cold Case); no musical score emphasises the tense or dramatic moments; and there is nothing at all gratuitous about any drug use, coarse language or violence. Everything is realistic, right down to the occasionally indecipherable language of the tenement blocks or the shipping talk of the stevedores.I think these are the strong points of the show. There's many more, but these are what come to mind for me.The only unfortunate thing is that 'The Wire' is really only a 'once only' watch. It doesn't quite have the humour or replay value of The Sopranos or Deadwood. But don't let this put you off. That said, it would be a crime to watch 'The Wire' casually, without taking time to absorb every plot detail.

The Barksdale drug syndicate is still in motion, albeit with a lack of quality product. A beef between two Pollocks has Baltimore Maj. Stan Valchek forming a detail (ring a bell?) to target Frank Sobotka, leader of the local longshoremens union.And who, you might ask, is on that detail? Why, none other than our illustrious detectives from season one of ""The Wire,"" minus McNulty, who has been relegated to duty as marine police (""He's either gonna quit, or drown... that's the only way he's gettin' off that boat,"" says his boss).The second season of ""The Wire"" goes waaaaay further down the rabbit-hole, delving into all sorts of areas: there's the longshoremen who, when they're not stealing off the docks for themselves, are sneaking cargo through the ports. There's the organized criminals whose cargo is being snuck. There's The Greek, a mysterious criminal mastermind who, well, may or may not be Greek. There's Ziggy Sobotka, Frank's dumba** son, who can't seem to pull a clean caper to save his life, and his cousin Nicky, who's impressing the Greeks with his business savvy in......the drug trade, which is where the Barksdale crew comes back into the picture. It's all interconnected, and it would be unfair to say how. Just that it's great.This second season, in addition to presenting another very realistic, gritty criminal investigation, touches on other areas of our social fabric. In one montage, a detective, talking about the detail's surveillance equipment, marvels ""Ain't technology great?"" while Sobotka and his union buddies are watching a promo film about the robotic cargo technology that threatens to replace them. Another storyline follows a rift between the jailed Avon Barksdale and his No. 1 man, Stringer Bell, over how and where their product gets distributed.And, of course, everyone's favorite characters (or at least mine), Det. Drunk (I mean Bunk) Moreland and my man Omar are back, stealing this season's gut-busters, especially when Omar appears as a witness in one of Avon's shooter's murder trial.Add to that McNulty trying, probably too hard, to put his family back together, and it's another great season, well worth watching.",4,More complex and even more entertaining than the first season,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2227,"['Wow.At', 'times', 'may', 'seem', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'once', 'Barksdale', 'drug', 'syndicate', 'still', 'motion', 'lack', 'quality', 'product', 'beef', 'two', 'Pollocks', 'Baltimore', 'Maj.', 'Stan', 'Valchek', 'forming', 'detail', 'ring', 'bell', 'target', 'Frank', 'Sobotka', 'leader', 'local', 'longshoremens', 'union.And', 'who', 'might', 'ask', 'detail', 'Why', 'none', 'other', 'illustrious', 'detectives', 'season', 'one', 'Wire', 'McNulty', 'who', 'been', 'relegated', 'duty', 'marine', 'police', 'gon', 'quit', 'drown', 'only', 'way', 'gettin', 'off', 'boat', 'boss', 'second', 'season', 'Wire', 'waaaaay', 'further', 'rabbit-hole', 'delving', 'sorts', 'areas', 'longshoremen', 'who', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'stealing', 'off', 'docks', 'are', 'sneaking', 'cargo', 'ports', 'organized', 'criminals', 'cargo', 'being', 'snuck', 'Greek', 'mysterious', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'who', 'well', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Greek', 'Ziggy', 'Sobotka', 'Frank', 'dumba**', 'son', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pull', 'clean', 'caper', 'save', 'life', 'cousin', 'Nicky', 'who', 'impressing', 'Greeks', 'business', 'savvy', 'drug', 'trade', 'where', 'Barksdale', 'crew', 'back', 'picture', 'interconnected', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'say', 'how', 'Just', 'great.This', 'second', 'season', 'addition', 'presenting', 'very', 'realistic', 'gritty', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'touches', 'other', 'areas', 'social', 'fabric', 'one', 'montage', 'detective', 'talking', 'detail', 'surveillance', 'equipment', 'marvels', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'technology', 'great', 'Sobotka', 'union', 'buddies', 'are', 'watching', 'promo', 'film', 'robotic', 'cargo', 'technology', 'replace', 'storyline', 'rift', 'jailed', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'No', '1', 'man', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'how', 'where', 'product', 'distributed.And', 'course', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'characters', 'least', 'mine', 'Det', 'Drunk', 'mean', 'Bunk', 'Moreland', 'man', 'Omar', 'are', 'back', 'stealing', 'season', 'gut-busters', 'especially', 'when', 'Omar', 'witness', 'one', 'Avon', 'shooter', 'murder', 'trial.Add', 'McNulty', 'trying', 'probably', 'too', 'hard', 'put', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'great', 'season', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
869434,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B0006IUD9Y,Patrick L. Randall,"[0, 0]","The first season of ""The Wire"", the gritty Baltimore crime drama, set the standard by which all crime shows and premium cable shows should be measured.  Season two of ""The Wire"" had an awful lot to match up to and it doesn't quite succeed at the level of the first season, but it is still strong entertainment.This season begins with the task force no longer being together following the pyrrhic `success' over the Barksdale Gang from the previous year, with Jimmy McNulty working harbor patrol as payback for his rogue attitude towards his superiors.  It's pyrrhic in that Avon Barksdale only received a small prison sentence due to another lieutenant taking the falls for most of the murders (he was going away for life anyway.  So, why not take a few more sentences on top of it), and Stringer Bell remained largely untouched.In this season, while the activities of the Barksdale Gang are still followed, with Stringer Bell as the de facto head while Avon is incarcerated, but they remain largely a background plot.  The primary focus is the dock workers and stevedores in the Baltimore Harbor.  Major Stan Valcheck (father-in-law of `Prez' from the task force) seeks to settle an old score against stevedore union head, Frank Sobotka, by having the task force brought back to investigate connections between Sobotka and smuggling being run by a nebulous underground crime lord, known only as ""The Greek"".The investigation storylines are not as crisp and popping as in Season 1, but the relationships among the characters are as strong as ever.  There are some hilarious moments, such as when Jimmy McNulty tries to go undercover in a prostitution ring and uses a really bad British accent to make him seem like a legitimate client.  This is particularly funny because McNulty's portrayer, Dominic West, was born and raised in Britain and has a perfect British accent in real life.The other intriguing relationship is between the meek `Prez' and overbearing Valcheck.  Valcheck has always viewed `Prez' as someone he could push around and step over.  Where's the breaking point for `Prez'?Overall, I enjoyed Season 2, and there are elements that I will want to go back and watch again when I make another pass through the series.

The crime bosses in this one are a fascinating and mysterious mix, whose organization and purpose remain deliciously unexplained.  There is also FBI involvement that turns in a shocking direction that is utterly unpredictable.

869445,AO6U3C5QH8CON,B0006IUD9Y,"Samuel Louis ""raisindot""","[13, 24]","I've been watching ""The Wire"" since it was first aired. Season One set the standard for intelligent, gripping, no-compromise drama that required you to meet it on its terms. Even if you couldn't understand the street-corner dialogue or the fraternal ""cop speak"" or the numerous plot twists, the grittiness and well-defined characters on both sides of the law made up for it.Season 2 doesn't match up to the intensity of Season 1 or the Jacobean rebound of Season 3. Its main problem is that the main narrative moves from the ""corners"" of Baltimore to the corruption-laden wharves of the harbor. A season-long who-dunnit concerning a shipping container of dead illegals spurs numerous examinations of union corruption and the decay of Baltimore's mercantile economy. The new characters introduced--nearly all white, and not very interesting--remove the main narrative thrust from the McNulty/Daniels/Barkesdale/Stringer axis that drove Season 1 forward. With these main characters--and their streetcorner dramas--serving as B stories, the dramatic tension decreases substantially.If one were on a budget, I'd recommend getting season 1 and 3, and either renting (or borrowing from a library) this one. The other seasons are watchable; this one is a bit of a chore to get through.",3,"A minor let down from Season one, but still a classic",1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,1278,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Wire', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'Season', 'One', 'set', 'standard', 'intelligent', 'gripping', 'no-compromise', 'drama', 'required', 'meet', 'terms', 'Even', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'street-corner', 'dialogue', 'fraternal', 'cop', 'speak', 'numerous', 'plot', 'twists', 'grittiness', 'well-defined', 'characters', 'sides', 'law', 'made', 'up', 'it.Season', '2', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'intensity', 'Season', '1', 'Jacobean', 'rebound', 'Season', '3', 'main', 'problem', 'main', 'narrative', 'moves', 'corners', 'Baltimore', 'corruption-laden', 'wharves', 'harbor', 'season-long', 'who-dunnit', 'concerning', 'shipping', 'container', 'dead', 'illegals', 'spurs', 'numerous', 'examinations', 'union', 'corruption', 'decay', 'Baltimore', 'mercantile', 'economy', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'nearly', 'white', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'remove', 'main', 'narrative', 'thrust', 'McNulty/Daniels/Barkesdale/Stringer', 'axis', 'drove', 'Season', '1', 'forward', 'main', 'characters', 'streetcorner', 'dramas', 'serving', 'B', 'stories', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'substantially.If', 'one', 'were', 'budget', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'season', '1', '3', 'either', 'renting', 'borrowing', 'library', 'one', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', 'watchable', 'one', 'bit', 'chore', 'get']",N/A
869446,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0006IUD9Y,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 0]","I fell in love with HBO's ""The Wire"" about half-way through the first season.  While I had heard all the rave reviews, I resisted the show at first because too much of the show seemed tied to the charismatically self-destructive Detective McNulty (Dominic West).  But as the show continued to spin its tangled tale of the Baltimore drug scene, with one perfectly-captured subplot adding new layers to the emerging whole, I couldn't resist.So I leapt into Season Two with reckless abandon . . . and dare I say it, Season Two is even better than Season One.  Season Two starts out simply enough, with a body being fished out of the bay by McNulty, now exiled to water patrol after offending one-too-many superiors.  Then thirteen dead bodies are found in a shipping container on the Baltimore docks, and the show takes off from there.What elevated Season One is how electrifying it made the routine drudgery of police work.  Using hard-won knowledge from Baltimore's real-world crime scene, the writers showed how complex a police procedural can be, and also how gripping.  If anything, Season Two offers an even more complex tapestry of subplots - the hard-knock life down on the Baltimore docks and union politics add even additional spice to the show's smorgasbord of police procedural, civic corruption, drug tales, and tidbits of personal life.Adding even more joy to the mix are a new batch of criminals from Eastern Europe, including ""The Greek,"" who bears more than a bit of a resemblance to the villain in ""The French Connection.""  Some had accused Season One of being too ham-fisted on racial issues b/c the drug kingpin and all his henchmen were black.  Such accusations were baseless, but one could not find any such quibbles here, as these new villains are as ruthless and evil as they come.But fear not - Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell, and everyone's favorite twisted Robin Hood (Occupation:  ""I rob drug dealers.""), Omar are back and in full force.""The Sopranos"" may get all the headlines for HBO series, but for my money, ""The Wire"" is every bit as fantastic a show, and perhaps even more so.

869447,A30X7VQZILMFZT,B0006IUD9Y,Sertorius,"[3, 4]","The greatest difference between the Wire and other police procurals is not necessarily quality, though the Wire is superbly written and acted, but rather the level of sheer authenticity it brings to the table.  There is very little suspension of disbelief required here; this is the world as we know it and people, warts and all, as we know them.  Unlike the fake, scripted 'reality' of reality television; the Wire gives us an artistic representation of reality.  Now back to your regularly scheduled review.Season 2 of the Wire is an even more intricate (though not necessarily superior) tapestry than Season 1.  All of the major players are back, though some (like D'Angelo Barksdale) have been relegated to supporting rolls.  To this mix is added a large number of new point of view characters, a number of supporting cast and a few movers and shakers lurking in the shadows.  The seasons principal threads start off very distant, particularly that of the Barksdale crew, but are slowly and meticulously woven together as the season progresses.  The stevedores on the Baltimore docks often have center stage and their is something Shakespearean in their inevitable fall.  The only mistep here is in the character of Ziggy, who inspires visceral loathing from his first moments on the screen.  The detectives from the first season of the Wire, start off scattered (mostly to unpleasant duties) but are slowly drawn back as the stakes of the investigation rise.  Once again they make enemies (particularly McNulty who has a genius for it), and once again they decide to do the best job that they are allowed to by their superiors.  The Barksdale crew have their own problems that don't intersect much with the other groups until the final episode.  The stage is set for their involvement in Season 3 though, and Stringer Bell is shaping up to be a more formidible crime lord than Avon Barksdale ever was.By the end of Season 2 of the Wire noone is really happy.  The investigation is largely sucessful, but fails to apprehend the major players who had been using the stevedores.  The stevedore's hopes for the future are shattered, their union crippled, and their personal lives in ruin.  There is really no clear winner, though there are many losers; once again much like real life.",5,The real reality show...,1121472000,"07 16, 2005",2005,2285,"['greatest', 'difference', 'Wire', 'other', 'police', 'procurals', 'not', 'necessarily', 'quality', 'Wire', 'superbly', 'written', 'acted', 'rather', 'level', 'sheer', 'authenticity', 'table', 'very', 'little', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'required', 'here', 'world', 'know', 'people', 'warts', 'know', 'fake', 'scripted', ""'reality"", 'reality', 'television', 'Wire', 'artistic', 'representation', 'reality', 'Now', 'back', 'regularly', 'scheduled', 'review.Season', '2', 'Wire', 'even', 'more', 'intricate', 'not', 'necessarily', 'superior', 'tapestry', 'Season', '1', 'major', 'players', 'are', 'back', ""D'Angelo"", 'Barksdale', 'have', 'been', 'relegated', 'supporting', 'rolls', 'mix', 'added', 'large', 'number', 'new', 'point', 'view', 'characters', 'number', 'supporting', 'cast', 'few', 'movers', 'shakers', 'lurking', 'shadows', 'seasons', 'principal', 'threads', 'start', 'off', 'very', 'distant', 'particularly', 'Barksdale', 'crew', 'are', 'slowly', 'meticulously', 'woven', 'together', 'season', 'stevedores', 'Baltimore', 'docks', 'often', 'have', 'center', 'stage', 'something', 'Shakespearean', 'inevitable', 'fall', 'only', 'mistep', 'here', 'character', 'Ziggy', 'who', 'visceral', 'loathing', 'first', 'moments', 'screen', 'detectives', 'first', 'season', 'Wire', 'start', 'off', 'scattered', 'mostly', 'unpleasant', 'duties', 'are', 'slowly', 'drawn', 'back', 'stakes', 'investigation', 'rise', 'Once', 'again', 'make', 'enemies', 'particularly', 'McNulty', 'who', 'genius', 'once', 'again', 'decide', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'are', 'allowed', 'superiors', 'Barksdale', 'crew', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'intersect', 'much', 'other', 'groups', 'final', 'episode', 'stage', 'set', 'involvement', 'Season', '3', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'more', 'formidible', 'crime', 'lord', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'ever', 'was.By', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'Wire', 'noone', 'really', 'happy', 'investigation', 'largely', 'sucessful', 'apprehend', 'major', 'players', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'using', 'stevedores', 'stevedore', 'hopes', 'future', 'are', 'shattered', 'union', 'crippled', 'personal', 'lives', 'ruin', 'really', 'clear', 'winner', 'are', 'many', 'losers', 'once', 'again', 'much', 'real', 'life']",N/A

869465,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0006IUD9Y,Wheelchair Assassin,"[80, 83]","Coming off the utter triumph of its first season, The Wire faced a pretty big test in trying to move on without compromising its astoundingly high quality, but having just finished watching I'm pleased to say any traces of a sophomore slump are virtually nonexistent.  Once again, the show brings just the right mix of cynicism, humor and tragedy to its stories of crime, punishment, and lives on the edge.  I don't know about the claims on this site that season two is superior to its predecessor, but The Wire's standards of writing, characterization, and realism are still very much intact.  Not to mention, The Wire's sprawling focus and blink-and-you're lost complexity are, if anything, stepped up as it juggles multiple, often tangentially related, plotlines over the course of its twelve-hour running time.  This season certainly doesn't see The Wire abandoning its examination of crime in Baltimore's black ghettoes, but rather expanding the view of its microscope to cover the illegal activities of the (mostly) white working class on the docks of the city's East Side and the international syndicate that provides their side income.  As a result, the reach of the show has become even more comprehensive, stretching from the projects to the docks to the police headquarters to the prison system.  At times there's a bit of a too-many-cooks feel to the events of this season as the show tries to shoehorn the struggles of the disrupted Barksdale-Bell drug crew into the main plotline (in a setup for the third season, it turned out), but that's a small complaint, as what goes on the screen is still probably the best TV out there.Season two starts with the major players, on both sides of the law, dispersed all around Baltimore, with McNulty and Daniels serving punishment duty as a result of their actions at the conclusion of the first season, Avon Barksdale and his nephew D'Angelo in lockup following their arrests, Omar hiding out in New York waiting to testify in a key murder trial, and Stringer Bell left trying to maintain his and Avon's housing-project drug empire in the face of serious supply problems.  McNulty, especially, has become a train wreck, with his addictive personality and dissatisfaction with his new post on the Maritime Police reaching new heights of self-destructiveness highlighted by an hilarious episode-opening bender that sees him smashing up his car and having random sex with a diner waitress before passing out in her bed.  It's not long, though, before everyone gets back together, as a personal vendetta draws the attention of Major Stan Valcheck (aka Prez's father-in-law) to the longshoreman's local led by his old neighborhood rival Frank Sobotka.  It does feel a bit contrived seeing the wire team brought together for another case, but seeing them do their thing in all its detail is still just an fascinating as ever when they finally get to it.  The show still provides a better look into modern policing than anything I've ever seen, from the nuts and bolts of surveillance work to the internecine wrangling that does nothing but impede the actual solving of crimes.  Not to mention, there are plenty of shocking moments thrown in to shake up the audience, from a pile of dead bodies in a container at the conclusion of the first episode to some truly cringe-inducing murder scenes to the sight of shotgun-toting street criminal and all-around tough guy Omar making out with his boyfriend.Season two introduces a new cast of villains, led by the mysterious elderly crime lord known only as The Greek and his murderous underlings, who have taken advantage of the local longshoremen's declining fortunes to turn the city's docks into their own personal way station for drugs, prostitutes, and God knows what else.  It also delves into the hard-boiled existence of a people who, in their own way, have been forgotten almost as much as blacks in the housing projects as the U.S. continues its transition to a middle-class country.  In the role of Frank Sobotka, Chris Bauer makes a more than convincing everyman, as we see the character dealing with everything from his crumbling union to his bumbling wannabe-criminal son to his nephew's increasing involvement in the urban drug trade.  As he struggles to keep his local (and his family) together in the face of the tightening scrutiny of the cops and the pressure of the Greek's crew, Sobotka also becomes increasingly symbolic of the decline of American union labor, but at the same time he emerges as a compelling character in his own right.  Frank is a relic and a dinosaur and he's starting to realize it more and more, but he still fights to maintain as much of his niche as he can, keeping up his determined front even as things fall apart around him.  He's proud of his job and what he's accomplished, and his grim resolve to resist his declining fortures sends him on an inexorable path to the season's grim resolution.While they don't assume center stage as much as in the first season, the Bell-Barksdale crew and many of its central figures are still around to one extent or another, with a whole new set of problems (ranging from the imprisoned D'Angelo's newfound independence to the aforementioned dearth of quality product) putting Stringer and Avon in major damage-control mode.  Left to run the crew largely on his own, Stringer emerges as an even more fascinating and complex character, a villain whose intelligence and calculation are matched only by his ruthlessness; you get the sense this guy would kill his own mother in the name of business.  At the same time, though, it's hard not to admire his single-minded commitment to being the best at what he does, no matter how tough the decisions it requires of him.  Watching Stringer work, I couldn't help but think he would've made a great captain of industry if he had been born in the suburbs instead of the projects.  This season also sees the start of the rift between Stringer and Avon that would only intensify in the third season.  Needless to say, the emergence of this division is handled in the show's usual organic and realistic manner, with the tension between Avon's street-soldier philosophy and Stringer's all-business approach culminating in their vastly different attempts to resolve their supply problems.  Fortunately, the problems in the Bell-Barksdale camp do give us viewers Brother Mouzone, a bowtie-wearing Muslim hitman from New York with an odd combination of comprehensive education and seemingly unmatched deadliness, who's brought in by Avon to protect the crew's territory and ends up running into some problems of his own involving a long-running grudge between Omar and Stringer.As others have noted, the events of any season of The Wire are difficult to encapsulate in a review; anything anyone can write short of a full-length magazine feature is just going to be a bare-bones outline that comes nowhere near capturing the exhaustive detail that goes into each episode.  Suffice it to say, then, that season two is a seamless progression from its predecessor, while at the same time setting up events that continue to unfold even now, two seasons later.  It's just part of an ongoing saga, but at the same time everything that happens in this season is worth watching in its own right.  Every season is brilliant in its own way, from the intense, propulsive first to the sprawling, tragic, recently completed fourth, and season two is no exception.  If you've never seen this show, you're missing out on the best TV has to offer.
