And at that, it came off pretty well.Although there was some strained credibility in the origin of the creature, my gosh, this is a Monster Movie.  Since when did they have anything BUT a strained basis in fact?  It made just enough sense to get on with the elements that make a good Monster Movie: a viscious critter doing awful things to human victims; chases; hair-breadth escapes; a slow revealing of the monster; a resourceful heroine in peril....you know, Monster Movie stuff.If you loved Ray Harryhausen's 50's monster movies (20 Million Miles to Earth, etc.) you will like this film.  If you DON'T like the genre, for crying out loud don't get this film.Looking at the other reviews, I liked most of what others didn't.  I liked the darkness. The tunnels lit only by flashlight and the dark recesses of something so mundane as a museum were used exceptionally well to build suspense.  I liked the actors and thought they all did well with the material.I thought Hyam's did a nice job of building to the climax.  AND the Critter here is a dandy.  Stan Winston did just fine and the combination of full size models and CG worked well and gave the Critter unusual and credible motion.It is a gory movie done with style.  There are some nasty decapitations etc., but this is, after all, a Monster Movie.  If you like that stuff, you'll love this flick.Of course Alien is a better-realized film, but there is still room for another Monster Movie. This is a first-class B movie.  It has every right to be judged on its merits, which are considerable.  I found it engaging all the way through.  I have a fondness for the genre.3-1/2 to 4 stars.  Entertaining all the way.  I will now get the book and see what everyone was harping about, but it won't change my opinion on how well the movie works.  It may not be the book, but it works as a movie.",4,It's a Monster Movie Folks,990230400,"05 19, 2001",2001,1988,"['did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Relic', 'was', 'book', 'have', 'ordered', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'release', 'just', 'judged', 'Monster', 'Movie', 'came', 'off', 'pretty', 'was', 'strained', 'credibility', 'origin', 'creature', 'gosh', 'Monster', 'Movie', 'when', 'did', 'have', 'anything', 'BUT', 'strained', 'basis', 'fact', 'made', 'just', 'enough', 'sense', 'get', 'elements', 'make', 'good', 'Monster', 'Movie', 'viscious', 'critter', 'doing', 'awful', 'things', 'human', 'victims', 'chases', 'hair-breadth', 'escapes', 'slow', 'revealing', 'monster', 'resourceful', 'heroine', 'peril', '.you', 'know', 'Monster', 'Movie', 'stuff.If', 'loved', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', '50', 'monster', 'movies', '20', 'Million', 'Miles', 'Earth', 'etc', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'like', 'genre', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'film.Looking', 'other', 'reviews', 'liked', 'most', 'what', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'liked', 'darkness', 'tunnels', 'lit', 'only', 'flashlight', 'dark', 'recesses', 'something', 'so', 'mundane', 'museum', 'were', 'used', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'build', 'suspense', 'liked', 'actors', 'thought', 'did', 'well', 'material.I', 'thought', 'Hyam', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'building', 'climax', 'Critter', 'here', 'dandy', 'Stan', 'Winston', 'did', 'just', 'fine', 'combination', 'full', 'size', 'models', 'CG', 'worked', 'well', 'gave', 'Critter', 'unusual', 'credible', 'motion.It', 'gory', 'movie', 'done', 'style', 'are', 'nasty', 'decapitations', 'etc.', 'Monster', 'Movie', 'like', 'stuff', ""'ll"", 'love', 'flick.Of', 'course', 'Alien', 'better-realized', 'film', 'still', 'room', 'Monster', 'Movie', 'first-class', 'B', 'movie', 'right', 'be', 'judged', 'merits', 'are', 'considerable', 'found', 'engaging', 'way', 'have', 'fondness', 'genre.3-1/2', '4', 'stars', 'Entertaining', 'way', 'will', 'now', 'get', 'book', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'was', 'harping', 'about', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'opinion', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'book', 'movie']",The Relic VHS

425098,AMICVV9N2U2R4,630448187X,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[2, 2]","I was all for expecting The Relic to be another run-of-the-mill monster movie. Boy was I wrong. This just might be the best monster movie I have ever seen, with a believable and action-packed story, good acting and thrilling special effects - thrilling because they bring something thrilling to life; the monster.Centering around the gala opening night of a museum exhibition in Chicago, ""The Relic"" follows evolutionary biologist Dr Margo Green and Lt Vincent D'Agosta as they unravel the mystery of a monster that holds the entire museum in its grasp. With the power down and the people trapped in the museum, they have to find a way to escape.This is one well-conceived and believable story featuring themes such as rapid evolution and mixed DNA. Furthermore, Penelope Ann Miller is superb in the leading role. While the good stuff doesn't begin until about 40 minutes to the end, it sure gets good, with the suspension, action and terror rising.Of course, the main attraction of The Relic is the monster. Similar to Jaws, the actual monster is hidden for much of the film. There, however, the similarities end. When the wait is over, The Relic reveals itself to be an excellent beast, aesthetic and even beautiful. It's stupendously brought to life with excellent animation. The scenes with the monster wouldn't look out-of-date on the screen today.Like many excellent films, The Relic has one awful DVD cover. It says nothing about the thrill and even beauty of what is found within. I use the term ""beauty"" loosely, there's some gruesome things that happen but nothing that steps over the line too much. Overall, The Relic is an excellent film. Bear with it for its first half and watch with your eyes glued to the screen as it draws towards its conclusion. I won't even spoil how the beast looks, you need to see it for yourself.",4,"Cool Monster, Good Story, Solid Movie",1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1836,"['was', 'expecting', 'Relic', 'be', 'run-of-the-mill', 'monster', 'movie', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'monster', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'believable', 'action-packed', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'thrilling', 'special', 'effects', 'thrilling', 'bring', 'something', 'thrilling', 'life', 'monster.Centering', 'gala', 'opening', 'night', 'museum', 'exhibition', 'Chicago', 'Relic', 'evolutionary', 'biologist', 'Dr', 'Margo', 'Green', 'Lt', 'Vincent', ""D'Agosta"", 'unravel', 'mystery', 'monster', 'entire', 'museum', 'grasp', 'power', 'down', 'people', 'trapped', 'museum', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'escape.This', 'one', 'well-conceived', 'believable', 'story', 'featuring', 'themes', 'such', 'rapid', 'evolution', 'mixed', 'DNA', 'Furthermore', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'superb', 'leading', 'role', 'good', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'begin', '40', 'minutes', 'end', 'sure', 'good', 'suspension', 'action', 'terror', 'rising.Of', 'course', 'main', 'attraction', 'Relic', 'monster', 'Similar', 'Jaws', 'actual', 'monster', 'hidden', 'much', 'film', 'however', 'similarities', 'end', 'When', 'wait', 'Relic', 'be', 'excellent', 'beast', 'aesthetic', 'even', 'beautiful', 'stupendously', 'brought', 'life', 'excellent', 'animation', 'scenes', 'monster', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'out-of-date', 'screen', 'today.Like', 'many', 'excellent', 'films', 'Relic', 'one', 'awful', 'DVD', 'cover', 'nothing', 'thrill', 'even', 'beauty', 'what', 'found', 'use', 'term', 'beauty', 'loosely', 'gruesome', 'things', 'happen', 'nothing', 'line', 'too', 'much', 'Overall', 'Relic', 'excellent', 'film', 'Bear', 'first', 'half', 'watch', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'conclusion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'spoil', 'how', 'beast', 'need', 'see']",The Relic VHS

I am in the camp that thinks this film is a travesty of the fine book by Preston and Child.  As I was reading the book I was envisioning scenes and situations and even the monster and, upon seeing the film about a week later, was disappointed in every way but one.They had no business keeping the name of the book, since two of the four main characters are eviscerated -- FBI Special Agent Pendergast, the heart of the team, and Bill Smithback, reporter.  Unbelievable.  Also the monster was not as scary as the book, not even as scary as the drawing on the cover of the book, except in one scene.  The movie did do a better job of having Margo battle the monster using her scientific skills, and one of the last sequences, where the creature is on fire and chasing Margo through the museum, is one of the best effects I've ever seen.  It's spectacular.  But there were also a lot of scenes that made me howl (with derision) whereas the book is fast, intelligent and scary as all getout.  Too bad the filmmakers didn't have more respect for the book.I tried to view the film as independent from the book, wondering if I'd be afraid if I hadn't read the book first, but I honestly don't think I would.  This was a real wasted opportunity.

425112,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,630448187X,Brian,"[2, 2]","Maybe I'm just naive, but I completely fail to understand why this movie receives so much unfair negativity. As a life-long fan of horror and monster movies, I was thoroughly entertained.My spouse and I caught ""The Relic"" in an overly chilled and packed theater with some friends of ours a short while after its release, years before I ever bothered to read the book, and the DVD has been a mainstay of our collection ever since.While I do admit the novel did go into a little more detail and flesh out more of the movie's weaker moments, I was still able to accept both mediums for what they were. I've never been the type of person who rips a movie to thousands of gory shreds because it didn't perfectly follow the novel it was based upon. Movies hardly ever stick to their source media one hundred percent; that's just a given. I was an avid reader of Fangoria magazine at the time, so I was already aware of the creative changes that were made within the screenplay. There would be no Bill Smithback or Detective Pendergast. The brain-sucking creature, Kothoga, was actually called ""Mbwun"" in the book, and the film was set in Chicago instead of New York. I've since read the Preston/Child novel from cover to cover and these differences, while admittedly extreme in comparison, do not adversely affect my positive opinion of the film. I rather liked Tom Sizemore's portrayal of Lieutenant D'Agosta. He seemed right for the role. James Whitmore, Linda Hunt, and Penelope Ann Miller were also uniform picks.But the real star, hands down, is the creature, itself! This ""thing,"" for lack of a better word, is straight out of your worst nightmare! It reminded me, quite frankly, of something I'd expect to see in a ""Resident Evil"" game. It's presence throughout the film was precipitated by a wet sort of snuffling sound. It was enough to set my every nerve on edge, sitting in that dark theater, because I couldn't begin to imagine what could possibly be making that sort of noise! And when it was finally revealed during the film's final reel, I was not disappointed. The legendary Stan Winston is known for his contributions to such films as ""Aliens, Jurassic Park, Predator, and Pumpkinhead."" But here, he created a unique and truly terrifying beast! From the moment it shows up, all bets are off and this movie plunges into classic old-school monster mode!If you haven't already been able to figure it out, by virtue of my enthusiasm, I had an all out blast with this flick! It won't appeal to everybody, I grant you, but it was far from the irredeemable garbage that so many here are making it out to be.",5,A standout personal favorite.....,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,2611,"['Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'naive', 'completely', 'fail', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'unfair', 'negativity', 'life-long', 'fan', 'horror', 'monster', 'movies', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained.My', 'spouse', 'caught', 'Relic', 'overly', 'chilled', 'packed', 'theater', 'friends', 'ours', 'short', 'while', 'release', 'years', 'ever', 'bothered', 'read', 'book', 'DVD', 'been', 'mainstay', 'collection', 'ever', 'since.While', 'do', 'admit', 'novel', 'did', 'go', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'flesh', 'out', 'more', 'movie', 'weaker', 'moments', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'accept', 'mediums', 'what', 'were', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'movie', 'thousands', 'gory', 'shreds', 'did', ""n't"", 'perfectly', 'follow', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'Movies', 'hardly', 'ever', 'stick', 'source', 'media', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'just', 'given', 'was', 'avid', 'reader', 'Fangoria', 'magazine', 'time', 'was', 'already', 'aware', 'creative', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'screenplay', 'would', 'be', 'Bill', 'Smithback', 'Detective', 'Pendergast', 'brain-sucking', 'creature', 'Kothoga', 'was', 'actually', 'called', 'Mbwun', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'set', 'Chicago', 'instead', 'New', 'York', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Preston/Child', 'novel', 'cover', 'cover', 'differences', 'admittedly', 'extreme', 'comparison', 'do', 'not', 'adversely', 'affect', 'positive', 'opinion', 'film', 'rather', 'liked', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'portrayal', 'Lieutenant', ""D'Agosta"", 'seemed', 'right', 'role', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'were', 'also', 'uniform', 'real', 'star', 'down', 'creature', 'thing', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'straight', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'reminded', 'quite', 'frankly', 'something', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'game', 'presence', 'film', 'was', 'precipitated', 'wet', 'sort', 'snuffling', 'sound', 'was', 'enough', 'set', 'nerve', 'edge', 'sitting', 'dark', 'theater', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'imagine', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'making', 'sort', 'noise', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'revealed', 'film', 'final', 'reel', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'legendary', 'Stan', 'Winston', 'known', 'contributions', 'such', 'films', 'Aliens', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Predator', 'Pumpkinhead', 'here', 'created', 'unique', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'beast', 'moment', 'up', 'bets', 'are', 'off', 'movie', 'classic', 'old-school', 'monster', 'mode', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'virtue', 'enthusiasm', 'had', 'out', 'blast', 'flick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everybody', 'grant', 'was', 'far', 'irredeemable', 'garbage', 'so', 'many', 'here', 'are', 'making', 'be']",The Relic VHS

425126,A2198FZZMTJ38H,630448187X,D. Litton,"[67, 77]","So there I was, beginning to watch &quot;The Relic,&quot; and snoring at yet another movie with a beginning sequence of a tribal ritual involving an American observer who ends up finding himself in danger. And then, two minutes later, my interest was peaked, and stayed that way for the movie's running length. &quot;The Relic,&quot; while not being the most original monster movie ever made, is certainly a good example for other movies to follow. The story is intelligent and involving, while the suspense keeps viewers involved in a way that is almost frightening by itself.The movie begins with the aforementioned tribal sequence, then takes us to Chicago, where a mysterious unmanned shipping vessel has made its way to port. On board, Lt. Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) finds the mangled corpses of the crew, and does what any other cop would do: puts someone else in charge of getting the details. Days later, at the Museum of Natural History, boxes from the vessel arrive and get the attention of Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller), who finds a mysterious growth she believes to be fungus on the leaves found in the box.Her examination takes a backseat to the story's main premise, which includes lots of gore and intensity. When a cop is found brutally mutilated in the men's bathroom at the museum, the establishment is closed for investigation, much to the dismay of curator Dr. Ann Cuthbert (Linda Hunt), whose worries about an expensive gala force D'Agosta to hurry his investigation. D'Agosta also stumbles across the fact that the victims found on the ship and the cop are found with a section of the brain removed, the section responsible for hormone release.The gala goes on according to plan, but soon, things begin to go awry. The museum's security mainframe goes down, enclosing our main characters and a few party attendees inside. Whether or not the creature is responsible for this is left unexplained, as is his intelligence. But he certainly knows his way around the museum, and as the bodies begin to drop, the movie builds itself to an intense climax that has suspense leading up to it all the way.Much of that suspense is due mostly to Peter Hyams, the director of photography as well as the director of the movie, whose use of shadow and light are a key element in bringing out the fear in all of us. There's nothing scarier than what we can hear but cannot see, and Hyams uses this to his advantage by supplying little light to the movie's most intense moments. Scenes in underground tunnels are lits by flashlights alone, while the museum's basement areas are dim and murky. Not only is this a fright factor, but it gives the movie a sense of style.That fright is also kept up to speed by keeping the creature's full appearance in the dark until much later in the film. Done in live action and CGI, the monster is authentic-looking and realistic, a very convincing achievement. Not until the last half hour to we get a full revelation of the creature in its entire, and even then, the suspense still keeps coming.The movie's story is intelligent, providing an explanation for almost every action and reaction seen on camera. The plot does more than just put its characters in dangerous situations, something that most movies of this genre are famous for. It gives the characters a chance to decipher the puzzle and figure out the monster's origins, and while those facts are somewhat laughable and contrived, they are convincing from the mouths of the actors, who do a stunning job on the film.The movie also seems to poke fun at the many horror tactics used along the years, but keeps up a serious demeanor while doing so. Scenes involving key characters going into dark rooms, hearing sounds and running away, only to find their fears were in vain, give us a sense of relief but also build up a false sense of security. I practically wanted to scream at some of the actions taken by certain people, who, if they've ever seen &quot;Alien,&quot; should know better than to do what they do.I had a lot of fun with &quot;The Relic,&quot; a movie that has been downed for its all-too-familiar similarities to other creature features.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","A museum doesn't seem like a logical place to find a giant primordial reptilian monster with a taste for brains.But that seems to describe ""Relic,"" which is loosely based on a novel by Douglas J. Preston and Lincoln Child. It tries mightily to add the ""Alien"" monster-movie aesthetic to a more cerebral setting, but the sludgy pace and massive plot holes make it a chore to sit through -- and no matter how many gory body parts it flings at you, nothing really horrifies.A ship arrives in Chicago with its crew horribly murdered, and Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) has no idea what has happened. The cargo -- crates from a roving anthropologist -- is sent to the Museum of Natural History for their ""Superstition"" exhibit, but Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller) finds nothing inside but a stone idol and leaves covered in a strange fungus.Then a security guard is brutally murdered in a bizarre way -- he's decapitated, his brain is torn out and his hypothalamus goes missing. D'Agosta immediately shuts down the museum and begins searching for the killer, but Green begins to suspect that something more bizarre is afoot. But even if they can figure out what the killer is, they may not be able to stop it.Just a warning: fans of Preston and Child's thriller series will be hugely disappointed in ""Relic."" The unique lead character has been completely cut out of the story -- imagine an adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" without Frodo Baggins -- and the plot is transformed into a generic monster movie with generic characters. It feels sort of like ""Alien,"" except without the feeling of being trapped (since they can easily leave the museum) or the build-up of tension and horror.One of the biggest problems is that the movie never really gets SCARY. There are scenes of gore and graphic violence -- heads pop off, a man is torn in half, explosions -- but it's not really frightening. The plot also proceeds at a glacial pace, with predictable twists (wow, what's going to happen at the gala?) and a big explosive finale that feels out-of-sync with the ponderous story.It's also almost impossible to see what's happening in many scenes, except vague dark shapes careening through small rooms. Would it kill somebody in the museum to switch on the lights, or did the monster magically turn off the electricity?And there are so many gaping plot holes and illogical elements that your brain might rip ITSELF out. For instance, we are supposed to believe that a mindless beast the size of a bull rhino is somehow able to remain CONCEALED in a museum. How? I don't know. Then again, the museum has a bizarrely large number of damp, dripping tunnels.Most of the characters are pure stereotype -- Tom Sizemore does what he can with D'Agosta, but the character is basically a standard hard-boiled New Yawk cop with no real development. I assume that Miller's Dr. Green is meant to be the heroine, but her condescending insistence that everything that is not purely based on cold hard science (like anthropology or psychology) is ""superstition"" just left me wishing the monster would eat HER hypothalamus.""Relic"" is mildly diverting as a monstrous-creature-running-amuck-eating-brains flick, but the glacial pace and massive logical holes left me wishing for more monster, less tedium.",2,Dusty relic,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,3294,"['museum', ""n't"", 'seem', 'logical', 'place', 'find', 'giant', 'primordial', 'reptilian', 'monster', 'taste', 'brains.But', 'describe', 'Relic', 'loosely', 'based', 'novel', 'Douglas', 'J.', 'Preston', 'Lincoln', 'Child', 'mightily', 'add', 'Alien', 'monster-movie', 'aesthetic', 'more', 'cerebral', 'setting', 'sludgy', 'pace', 'massive', 'plot', 'holes', 'make', 'chore', 'sit', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'gory', 'body', 'parts', 'nothing', 'really', 'horrifies.A', 'ship', 'Chicago', 'crew', 'horribly', 'murdered', 'Lieutenant', 'Vincent', ""D'Agosta"", 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'cargo', 'roving', 'anthropologist', 'sent', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'Superstition', 'exhibit', 'Dr.', 'Margo', 'Green', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'nothing', 'inside', 'stone', 'idol', 'covered', 'strange', 'fungus.Then', 'security', 'guard', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'bizarre', 'way', 'decapitated', 'brain', 'torn', 'out', 'hypothalamus', 'missing', ""D'Agosta"", 'immediately', 'down', 'museum', 'searching', 'killer', 'Green', 'suspect', 'something', 'more', 'bizarre', 'afoot', 'even', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'killer', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'it.Just', 'warning', 'fans', 'Preston', 'Child', 'thriller', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'Relic', 'unique', 'lead', 'character', 'been', 'completely', 'cut', 'story', 'imagine', 'adaptation', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Frodo', 'Baggins', 'plot', 'transformed', 'generic', 'monster', 'movie', 'generic', 'characters', 'sort', 'Alien', 'feeling', 'being', 'trapped', 'can', 'easily', 'leave', 'museum', 'build-up', 'tension', 'horror.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'SCARY', 'are', 'scenes', 'gore', 'graphic', 'violence', 'heads', 'pop', 'off', 'man', 'torn', 'half', 'explosions', 'not', 'really', 'frightening', 'plot', 'also', 'glacial', 'pace', 'predictable', 'twists', 'wow', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'gala', 'big', 'explosive', 'finale', 'out-of-sync', 'ponderous', 'story.It', 'also', 'almost', 'impossible', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'many', 'scenes', 'vague', 'dark', 'shapes', 'careening', 'small', 'rooms', 'Would', 'kill', 'somebody', 'museum', 'switch', 'lights', 'did', 'monster', 'magically', 'turn', 'off', 'electricity', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'illogical', 'elements', 'brain', 'might', 'rip', 'ITSELF', 'out', 'instance', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'mindless', 'size', 'bull', 'rhino', 'somehow', 'able', 'remain', 'CONCEALED', 'museum', 'How', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Then', 'again', 'museum', 'bizarrely', 'large', 'number', 'damp', 'dripping', 'tunnels.Most', 'characters', 'are', 'pure', 'stereotype', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'what', 'can', ""D'Agosta"", 'character', 'basically', 'standard', 'hard-boiled', 'New', 'Yawk', 'cop', 'real', 'development', 'assume', 'Miller', 'Dr.', 'Green', 'meant', 'be', 'heroine', 'condescending', 'insistence', 'everything', 'not', 'purely', 'based', 'cold', 'hard', 'science', 'anthropology', 'psychology', 'superstition', 'just', 'left', 'wishing', 'monster', 'would', 'eat', 'HER', 'hypothalamus', 'Relic', 'mildly', 'diverting', 'monstrous-creature-running-amuck-eating-brains', 'flick', 'glacial', 'pace', 'massive', 'logical', 'holes', 'left', 'wishing', 'more', 'monster', 'less', 'tedium']",The Relic VHS
425129,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,630448187X,Einsatz,"[5, 6]","First of all, I loved the book Relic and its sequel Reliquary.  It didn't bother me that in this case great liberties were taken with the book when they `transformed' it for the screen.  I love the movie as is by not comparing it to the book.  No matter what, you will always have the source material, intact; it's not as if it disappears when a movie adaptation comes out.As for the criticism that most of this movie suffers from poor lighting....I can't argue that point.  The lighting is peculiar and not a little deficient.  The revelation that surprised even me is that the director Peter Hyams filmed it that way on purpose.  He referred to it as ""exotic light"" consisting of shadow, darkness, hints of shape and movement; the less details seen the better.  He wanted confusion; he wanted terror built from what isn't seen as well as what is seen.  I might not agree with him on all of that as I am one of those people who like to see everything.  I don't believe that much darkness serves his purpose as well as he thought it did, and yet, this is one of my favorite films that I return to often, also upgraded to this Blu-ray version.  It's just as exciting the umpteenth time viewed as the first.  But it is, literally, dark, even in scenes that didn't make sense.  For example, the work space in the museum is also poorly lit.  How could scientists work under such conditions, they have to see what they're working on.  In addition, the museum is also dimly lit, how are you supposed to see the exhibits without proper lighting?  I think a better balance could have been struck between these scenes and the ones in the tunnels where darkness made sense, was even expected.  But of course no amount of second guessing is going to do any good at this point.  The movie is what it is and I love it.  The acting is great, the story moves along quickly, there's plenty of fright along the way as well as humor, and then of course, it stars the incomparable Linda Hunt.

425135,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,630448187X,G. Dowling,"[11, 13]","As I am sure anyone reading this review has seen the movie, I will primarily focus on the BD.  Though it must be said, ""The Relic"" has held up nicely over time.  The story of a monster on the loose in a museum, is the stuff of Saturday afternoon creature features.  Complete with a pretty young scientist, and a hard edged cop, all spouting off wonderful creature-feature dialogue about old legends and genetic mutation.  What makes the movie work so well is a very nice prestigious cast:  Penelope Ann Miller as anthropologist Margo Green, Tom Sizemore, reminding us why he was such an edgy leading man despite his personal demonds, as detetective D'Agosta.  Supporting players like James Whitmore, Linda Hunt, and a wonderful cameo by the late Audra Lindley as a foul-mouthed coroner make this the classy gala affair the movie centers on, and makes the proceedings feel more convincing and grounded than they are.  Above all, the A-movie production values, courtesy of Gale Ann Hurd give the movie some fabulous special effects both CGI (which have held up nicely) and awesome creature effects by the late Stan Winston.  Peter Hyams also managed to get the clearance to let this movie be a hard R-rated affair with lots of gore, decaptiations, and body splitting carnage.  Very fun, guilty pleasure of a movie...which while not a runaway hot, still did better than anyone expected and it has developed a loyal cult following.  The SD DVD was fine, but had many problems such as compression noise and the low bitrate couldn't handle the crushing shadows and blacks director Peter Hyams employs.  It is all the more of a treat that the Blu-ray is given first-rate treatment by LionsGage.""The Relic"" is a dark movie.  Very dark.  Peter Hyams, acting as his own DOP, employs heavy shadow and even in lit scenes, nothing burns brighter than 12 watts it would seem.  This has been a common complaint of the movie as it obstructs seeing the creature or the terrific CGI.  On the documentary and commentary, included for the first time on this disc, he makes a great case for why he did it this way.  His point is about focusing on natural light only, even when it is too dark, such as the scenes in the tunnels where the police are tracking the beastie...he points out that if they need flashlights to see, why not only show thw audience what is visible by flashlight or other available lighting.  This makes a good point and the movie would not have been as effective had it been subjected to increased lighting.  It allows us to feel like we are in the dark with them, not knowing what lurks off the light of our flashlight.The Blu-ray transfer makes for a real treat.  The MPEG 4 AVC encode allows the blacks and shadows to render more detail and keeps it true to Hyams' vision.  There is no artificial brightening or porcessing used.  Hyams made his case in my mind, and the tranfer is free from all of the DVD's flaws, and it looks marvelous.  The CGI effects look detailed and textured.  There are crushed blacks, but they are from the original master, and not the BD encode.  In short, it looks the best it ever has since the editing bay.The sound is a powerful DTS HD-MA 7.1.  It is a house-shaking, booming, exhilarating mix that is immersive (we can hear dripping water from every channel) with wonderful ambient and directional effects, but once the monster mayhem begins, the movie is full of devastating bass and exciting effects as the creature lumbers, runs, rips heads off, gets set on fire, etc.  It is a terrific transfer.The disc has spare feature, but LionsGage recorded a new commentary by Peter Hyams, a new documentary on Hyams, and the theatrical trailer.

On top if this, the creators were able to get the atmosphere just right (a phenomenon where the visuals, sound, and acting seem to come together in perfect harmony, allowing the viewer to feel like their experiencing something more than just a movie).Atmosphere is how I separate the great movies from the just good, and The Relic has it.  The slow reveal of the monster is perfect and the lighting sets the perfect mood for the story (most of it takes place in near darkness).

It's a frustrating treat for the eyes of horror, but one hopes for a little bit more.Penelope Anne Miller stars as Dr. Margo Green, an evolutionary biologist at the Chicago Natural History Museum (no such thing, I imagine; this was filmed at the Field Museum), and Tom Sizemore is here too as a cop investigating some deaths there and outside the museum, nasty deaths, too. I think Hyams does a great job setting up a doom-choked mood; acting as his own cinematographer, he gives the film a dark and dusty look which is appropriate to being set in a museum. I'd have preferred a little more light so that we could see a little more of the museum and what makes it such a wonderfully creepy setting for a horror film, but still, it works, and besides, seeing this on VHS, maybe I should be giving this movie the benefit of the doubt when things are, I trust, a little clearer on DVD. Unfortunately he's got this incredibly annoying habit of framing close-ups way too close. I don't know if the version on video is pan-n-scanned or simply unmated, so I don't know if it would have looked better, or worse, on the big screen. But these close-ups happen a lot and are a bit annoying.Stan Winston's creature, the Kothoga, is just great. At the time of this film's release, he said frequently that this was the best creature he'd yet created. It's kind of hard to describe, like a cross between a lion and a beetle, but it's big, it's nasty, and it's exceptionally well realized with animatronics and CGI (unusually good CGI for a creature that's hairy; hairy animals are much more difficult to create with computers than scaly ones). This movie's almost worth a rental just for one incredible shot of the Kothoga chasing down one unlucky guy, grabbing him, and ripping off his head, all in one flawless shot.Sad to say, the story surrounding this monster is ordinary, courtesy of four screenwriters. The central problem with the story is the character of Dr. Green, who has to be one of the most irritating big-screen heroines I've seen in my lifetime. The story itself, problem has no great shakes other, with the obligatory False Scare By Cat happening no more than ten minutes in, followed up later on by a False Scare By Cleaning Lady. There's a lot going for this movie, but it needed a lot more work in the creative department before being shot, not to mention Hyams needing a good, stern lecture about his use of close-ups. Beside that if you haven't seen this then I would recommend this to monster-movie enthusiasts, but most others won't get a lot out of this one.",3,An unwelcome brain sucker that might not be worth your time,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,2684,"['Relic', 'be', 'one', 'love-it-or-hate-it', 'movies', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'sitting', 'fence', 'frustrating', 'treat', 'eyes', 'horror', 'one', 'little', 'bit', 'more.Penelope', 'Anne', 'Miller', 'Dr.', 'Margo', 'Green', 'evolutionary', 'biologist', 'Chicago', 'Natural', 'History', 'Museum', 'such', 'thing', 'imagine', 'was', 'filmed', 'Field', 'Museum', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'here', 'too', 'cop', 'investigating', 'deaths', 'there', 'museum', 'nasty', 'deaths', 'too', 'think', 'Hyams', 'great', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'doom-choked', 'mood', 'acting', 'own', 'cinematographer', 'film', 'dark', 'dusty', 'look', 'appropriate', 'being', 'set', 'museum', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'little', 'more', 'light', 'so', 'could', 'see', 'little', 'more', 'museum', 'what', 'such', 'wonderfully', 'creepy', 'setting', 'horror', 'film', 'still', 'besides', 'seeing', 'VHS', 'maybe', 'should', 'be', 'giving', 'movie', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'trust', 'little', 'clearer', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'got', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'habit', 'framing', 'close-ups', 'way', 'too', 'close', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'version', 'video', 'pan-n-scanned', 'simply', 'unmated', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'better', 'worse', 'big', 'screen', 'close-ups', 'happen', 'lot', 'are', 'bit', 'annoying.Stan', 'Winston', 'creature', 'Kothoga', 'just', 'great', 'time', 'film', 'release', 'said', 'frequently', 'was', 'best', 'creature', ""'d"", 'yet', 'created', 'kind', 'hard', 'describe', 'cross', 'lion', 'beetle', 'big', 'nasty', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'realized', 'animatronics', 'CGI', 'unusually', 'good', 'CGI', 'creature', 'hairy', 'hairy', 'animals', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'create', 'computers', 'scaly', 'ones', 'movie', 'almost', 'rental', 'just', 'one', 'incredible', 'shot', 'Kothoga', 'chasing', 'down', 'one', 'unlucky', 'guy', 'grabbing', 'ripping', 'off', 'head', 'one', 'flawless', 'shot.Sad', 'say', 'story', 'surrounding', 'monster', 'ordinary', 'courtesy', 'four', 'screenwriters', 'central', 'problem', 'story', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Green', 'who', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'irritating', 'big-screen', 'heroines', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lifetime', 'story', 'problem', 'great', 'other', 'obligatory', 'False', 'Scare', 'Cat', 'happening', 'no', 'more', 'ten', 'minutes', 'followed', 'up', 'later', 'False', 'Scare', 'Cleaning', 'Lady', 'lot', 'going', 'movie', 'needed', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'creative', 'department', 'being', 'shot', 'not', 'mention', 'Hyams', 'needing', 'good', 'stern', 'lecture', 'use', 'close-ups', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'monster-movie', 'enthusiasts', 'most', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'one']",The Relic VHS

The monster design is great, but some of the CG is bad; it didn't bother me much, though, considering the movie is about 15 years old. And this monster can walk on walls, take huge leaps, run on four legs and swim, which I liked because it added variety. I also liked how they explained how the monster was created and what it really was in detail. The museum/lab setting was also great, I really enjoyed it. The story was great and the acting was fine.Overall, I definitely recommend watching The Relic.

Mostly because I'd read the book by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, and really did enjoyed the story.  The film is more than a little erratic in what it takes from the book and what it invents anew and I felt somewhat cheated.  One notable lack is Agent Prendergast, who goes on to occupy a major role in the series that followed the original novel.  The film gives away too much of the plot right away and misplays the characters a bit.What I did miss is that this horror film based on a genetic premise (gen migration) which is at least partially true isn't all that bad if you wait long enough to forget the book.  Tom Sizemore plays Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta who is investigating a deserted ship is found floating on Lake Michigan.  When towed in, it is found that the entire crew has been decapitated.  Suddenly a parallel murder happens in the Museum of Natural History and D'Agosta is faced with a museum full to twisty passages and a killer with a taste for human brains.The lady of the story is Penelope Ann Miller, who plays Dr. Margo Green.  And who had a stronger part in the book.  She is an evolutionary biologist struggling for grants at the museum.  She finds the clues that lead to the origin of a beast that in short order is terrorizing all the attendees an evening party for the museums new exhibit on superstition.  From that point on it's flying body parts, screaming crowds, and wild chase scenes.Given the lack of exceptional acting, interesting scenery, and cool side effects, the film still manages to be a bit better than the mediocre impression that I originally had.

Tuxedos and terror all in one huge building.WIthout spoiling it, let me say that this is a great movie to watch with your girl. It is well made enough, it's just that the plot is so predictable and stereotypes abound. As the lead character (Penelope Miller) works hard on her science to compete for a grant with an Asian co-worker, the co-worker is made out to be sinister and crooked -- ala Fu Manchu. He is then futher denigrated as a coward when he flees the monster but ends up being out-maneuvered. He can write a grant but he don't know how to get the hell out of Dodge. Yeah, right.Tom Sizemore appears in another macho role, and should thanks Wesley Snipes for making him a star in ""Passenger 57."" At any rate, he fears not the dark, slime or sounds that would tell anybody else that there's a monster nearby, let's book. NOpe, not Tommy boy. He and Penelope stand up to the mega-sized beast, who also has some human DNA, and during that time the guests are eaten up, one by one. A group of them escape through the tunnels under the Museum, but for the most part, the monster has a field day.ONe last point: The Relic is a movie heavy on scientific jargon and discussoins of genetics and DNA.

There wasn't anything particularly awful about the film but I felt like I've seen some of the concepts of the movie one to many times such as the two main characters... they begin to have feelings for each other and I originally thought that one of them was going to die but it was too clich&eacute; for that and it had a somewhat Hollywood ending with a predictable big explosion scene!Plot: It was discovered by a man of science, it was brought to a museum to be studied by scientists, it was eaten by a science pet (The Beetle), and now science has taken an evolutionary step and just in time for a new exhibit to open and now it's chow time for the creature that is part reptilian, part bug, and part human that will decapitate as many people as it can in a 109 minute process!Review: The film screamed Hollywood made to me like crazy! It had some good terrifying moments and some humorous comic-relief along with intense scenes to make up for the boring scenes. Plus another problem with the film was that it was a bit to dark and I felt like I was watching AVP-R: Alien vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) but just a tad bit lighter version! The special effects were phenomenal for the time and the acting was superb! But the film was a box office flop and it didn't deserve that. It had good and bad things to it.... Even if it had one big story for one small area of back story to cover it!Acting: As I said before the acting was superb and it definitely was. It wasn't the best performance I ever saw but it was pretty awesome!Gore: Decapitations, a body torn in two, and blood splatter! It had a liking to those decapitations.Bottom Line: Hectic and a Helluvalot of fun!

The monster-in-the-house scenario is given one more tired spin here and is distinguished only by a strangely boring cast and a criminally tedious screenplay. The film unfolds largely inside Chicago's Museum of National History but fails to make use of this potentially spectacular location - mainly because of director Hyams' impenetrable decision to shoot most of it in the dark. (I spent ten minutes fiddling with my set's brightness and contrast, to no avail.) That choice is typically made to improve the look of less-than-realistic digital effects (e.g. ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park""), but we rarely see the ""monster"" here and when we do it looks like just another of Stan Winston's rubber toys - never more so than in the ""Alien""-aping moment when it presumably lives the dream of the film's key demographic and licks the heroine's chest.

Director Peter Hyams does a great job staying true to the acclaimed 1995 novel of the same name (written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child), using a great balance of humor and terror to entertain.  The premise revolves around a frazzled researcher (Penelope Ann Miller) working at the Chicago Museum of Natural History who happens to come across a strange shipment.  The shipments are empty besides a strange kind of plant life that is unknown to the scientist.  Miller thinks nothing of it until museum workers start showing up dead, jeopardizing the grand opening of the museum's biggest exhibit opening in history.Tom Sizemore (in a refreshingly funny performance) stars as the detective assigned to the case, not realizing the terror that is running amok in the museum.  Both Sizemore and Miller work together to put the pieces of the mysterious deaths together, all the while attempting to survive against a fiendish beast of a monster that is eating everything in sight.

What is implied in the film (which apparently went over the heads of those  who gave this movie a negative review) but given some attention in the book  was that the Amazonian Indians fed the genetic altering substance to the  museum guy because they wanted the monster to destroy civilization and  therefore save their rainforest homeland from destruction and  development.Okay, enough insight.  I found The Relic to be a very  entertaining thriller.  I liked Tom Sizemore as Detective D'Agosta and I  have always been a fan of Penelope Ann Miller.  Like all well paced horror  films, The Relic starts out with a small body count and works its way up to  a grand finale. The creature, called the Kothoga, is pretty hideous  looking.  My main problem with the gory climax is that the monster seems to  be in more places at once, one minute it kills someone in the sewers below  the museum and the next minute it is taking out a SWAT team inside the  museum.If, like me, you are a fan of movies like ALIENS and DEEP RISING,  The Relic will be right up your alley.",4,Above Average Monster Movie,963792000,"07 17, 2000",2000,1208,"['saw', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'are', 'changes', 'mostly', 'names', 'characters', 'who', 'killed', 'What', 'implied', 'film', 'apparently', 'went', 'heads', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'negative', 'review', 'given', 'attention', 'book', 'was', 'Amazonian', 'Indians', 'fed', 'genetic', 'altering', 'substance', 'museum', 'guy', 'wanted', 'monster', 'destroy', 'civilization', 'therefore', 'save', 'rainforest', 'homeland', 'destruction', 'development.Okay', 'enough', 'insight', 'found', 'Relic', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'liked', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Detective', ""D'Agosta"", 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'well', 'paced', 'horror', 'films', 'Relic', 'out', 'small', 'body', 'count', 'way', 'grand', 'finale', 'creature', 'called', 'Kothoga', 'pretty', 'hideous', 'looking', 'main', 'problem', 'gory', 'climax', 'monster', 'be', 'more', 'places', 'once', 'one', 'minute', 'someone', 'sewers', 'museum', 'next', 'minute', 'taking', 'out', 'SWAT', 'team', 'museum.If', 'are', 'fan', 'movies', 'ALIENS', 'DEEP', 'RISING', 'Relic', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'alley']",The Relic VHS

425202,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,630448187X,trebe,"[2, 2]","The Relic (1997) is a big budget creature feature that gets many of the basics right.  Involved with the unraveling of a dark horrific mystery, director/cinematographer Peter Hyam's film grabs and holds your interest.  Leaving behind a trail of blood and severed heads, the dreadful threat is kept nicely hidden in the dark, until near the very end.  When the creature is finally revealed, its exact nature and form are a surprise, rendered with some excellence by Stan Winston's team of special effects wizards.The majority of the film is set in Chicago, mostly at the Museum of Natural History.  John Whitney an anthropologist with the museum, is exploring in Brazil, and sneaks aboard a ship bound for America, to try and find some crates with artifacts that he intended to send back to the museum.  The crates are not aboard, and are sent to the museum by another route.  Weeks later, Whitney's boat is found floating in Lake Michigan, with no survivors on board.  Police detectives Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore), and his partner Sergeant Holllingsworth (Clayton Rohner) are assigned to investigate the bizarre murder of the entire ship's crew.The decapitation of a guard at the museum, brings the police to the scene, and the facility is closed down, just before an important exhibit is about to open.  D'Agosta questions the staff, which includes Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller), Dr. Ann Cuthbert (Linda Hunt), Dr. Albert Frock (James Whitmore), and Dr. Greg Lee (Chi Muoi Lo), but no one knows anything.In the crates Whitney sent back are a stone statue of the devil god ""Kothoga"", and some leaves with a strange substance attached.  Dr. Green begins an investigation of the unknown substance, which eventually provides some leads to what is happening.  Under pressure from the Mayor, the museum reopens so the grand opening of the new exhibit hall can take place.  It is on this night that the mysterious beast strikes again, creating a disaster of epic proportions, as the facility loses electrical power, and goes into lockdown, trapping people inside, and then soaking them with water from the fire sprinkler system.  Emergency electrical power is limited, leaving the occupants mostly in the dark, as fire rescue and the police attempt to get into the building.Driven by the quest to find the monster, the film moves at a brisk pace.  With an ""all business"" approach, it doesn't get involved in the character's personal lives, and romance is not a factor.  Like some major studio productions, the story takes a few outrageous and unbelievable turns, designed to crank up the level of excitement.  While these elements do add to the drama, they also tend to make the movie ridiculous, as The Relic escalates into a bloodfest.The film's strong points include a unique creature, a suspenseful and creepy atmosphere, and a story based on both science and an intriguing legend.  The vicious Kothoga is surprisingly fast moving, and truly scary.  The suspense is particularly dense, as D'Agosta and his team probe a series of underground tunnels below the museum in the darkness, with search dogs.The Kothoga has an uncanny ability to appear wherever there are people, so death is almost a constant.  There is no help from the outside, so at the end it mostly comes down to Dr. Green battling the creature, in an overdramatic but well staged final act.  It's ridiculously dumb adventure, but one what is still fun.  On the Bluray edition, Peter Hyams (Outland, 2010, Timecop) provides a rather dry but informative commentary track.  Serving as both director and cinematographer for the film, Hyams offers more of his thoughts on moviemaking a separate interview.",4,"a creepy monster in a museum movie, with a major contribution from Stan Winston...",1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,3676,"['Relic', '1997', 'big', 'budget', 'creature', 'feature', 'many', 'basics', 'right', 'Involved', 'unraveling', 'dark', 'horrific', 'mystery', 'director/cinematographer', 'Peter', 'Hyam', 'film', 'grabs', 'interest', 'Leaving', 'trail', 'blood', 'severed', 'heads', 'dreadful', 'threat', 'kept', 'nicely', 'hidden', 'dark', 'very', 'end', 'When', 'creature', 'finally', 'revealed', 'exact', 'nature', 'form', 'are', 'surprise', 'rendered', 'excellence', 'Stan', 'Winston', 'team', 'special', 'effects', 'wizards.The', 'majority', 'film', 'set', 'Chicago', 'mostly', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'John', 'Whitney', 'anthropologist', 'museum', 'exploring', 'Brazil', 'aboard', 'ship', 'bound', 'America', 'try', 'find', 'crates', 'artifacts', 'intended', 'send', 'back', 'museum', 'crates', 'are', 'not', 'aboard', 'are', 'sent', 'museum', 'route', 'Weeks', 'later', 'Whitney', 'boat', 'found', 'floating', 'Lake', 'Michigan', 'survivors', 'board', 'Police', 'Vincent', ""D'Agosta"", 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'partner', 'Sergeant', 'Holllingsworth', 'Clayton', 'Rohner', 'are', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'bizarre', 'murder', 'entire', 'ship', 'crew.The', 'decapitation', 'guard', 'museum', 'police', 'scene', 'facility', 'closed', 'down', 'just', 'important', 'exhibit', 'open', ""D'Agosta"", 'questions', 'staff', 'Dr.', 'Margo', 'Green', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'Dr.', 'Ann', 'Cuthbert', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'Dr.', 'Albert', 'Frock', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'Dr.', 'Greg', 'Lee', 'Chi', 'Muoi', 'Lo', 'one', 'crates', 'Whitney', 'sent', 'back', 'are', 'stone', 'statue', 'devil', 'god', 'Kothoga', 'leaves', 'strange', 'substance', 'attached', 'Dr.', 'Green', 'investigation', 'unknown', 'substance', 'eventually', 'leads', 'what', 'happening', 'pressure', 'Mayor', 'museum', 'so', 'grand', 'opening', 'new', 'exhibit', 'hall', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'night', 'mysterious', 'beast', 'strikes', 'again', 'creating', 'disaster', 'epic', 'proportions', 'facility', 'electrical', 'power', 'lockdown', 'trapping', 'people', 'then', 'soaking', 'water', 'fire', 'sprinkler', 'system', 'Emergency', 'electrical', 'power', 'limited', 'leaving', 'occupants', 'mostly', 'dark', 'fire', 'rescue', 'police', 'attempt', 'get', 'building.Driven', 'quest', 'find', 'monster', 'film', 'moves', 'brisk', 'pace', 'business', 'approach', ""n't"", 'get', 'involved', 'character', 'personal', 'lives', 'romance', 'not', 'factor', 'major', 'studio', 'productions', 'story', 'few', 'outrageous', 'unbelievable', 'turns', 'designed', 'crank', 'up', 'level', 'excitement', 'elements', 'do', 'add', 'drama', 'also', 'tend', 'make', 'movie', 'ridiculous', 'Relic', 'bloodfest.The', 'film', 'strong', 'points', 'include', 'unique', 'creature', 'suspenseful', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'based', 'science', 'intriguing', 'legend', 'vicious', 'Kothoga', 'surprisingly', 'fast', 'moving', 'truly', 'scary', 'suspense', 'particularly', 'dense', ""D'Agosta"", 'team', 'probe', 'series', 'underground', 'tunnels', 'museum', 'darkness', 'search', 'dogs.The', 'Kothoga', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'appear', 'are', 'people', 'death', 'almost', 'constant', 'help', 'outside', 'so', 'end', 'mostly', 'down', 'Dr.', 'Green', 'battling', 'creature', 'overdramatic', 'well', 'staged', 'final', 'act', 'ridiculously', 'dumb', 'adventure', 'one', 'still', 'fun', 'Bluray', 'edition', 'Peter', 'Hyams', 'Outland', '2010', 'Timecop', 'rather', 'dry', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Serving', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'film', 'Hyams', 'more', 'thoughts', 'moviemaking', 'separate', 'interview']",The Relic VHS

He gets freaked out and tries to stop the crates he was shipping back to the United States from reaching there. Fast forward several weeks later to the harbor in Chicago. A boat from Brazil is found with all the crew decapitated. Forward another week to the Museum of Natural History in Chicago where most of the film's action takes place. A museum guard is found decapitated in the men's bathroom two nights before a big fundraising gala. The police have the museum shut down and want to postpone the gala, but the mayor won't have it. The event goes on and of course lots of people get killed.The movie starts interesting during the first ten minutes, but quickly slows down until the last forty minutes.

However, once the big event begins and you see what the monster is, the movie rivets you to your seat.I enjoyed THE RELIC, but would have enjoyed it more had it been faster paced.
