I found it watchable but little else. Somehow it all seemed so familiar.The plot involves a drifter (Vaughn) who is on his way to California to (supposedly) see his brother. He needs cash and hires on with a feed ranch. Varied sorts of troubles ensue and things go South rather quickly.The cast is pretty good. This must have been earlier in the careers of Paul Rudd and Vince Vaughn but they still do an admirable job. Jeremy Davies is good but he usually plays a nut case so there isn't much new there. Ashley Judd is pretty to look at and she does a decent job, but her character wasn't written particularly well. The big surprise was Kate Capshaw. I guess it's good she married Steven Spielberg, because the horrendous job she does acting in this would pretty much cut off the rest of her career.The directing is pretty much meat and potatoes. Carter Burwell's music score is good and the other areas of production are all professional. I guess I just didn't believe it all. It's almost a caricature of the genre.

No, it's not by Tennessee Williams, but it might as well be.Certainly owing a great debt to the masterful Southern playwright, this film has all the elements of one of Williams' plays. There's the heat, the rural locale, the unspoken mystery, the sexy male drifter and the faded Southern belle.The Locusts takes place in the 1950's. With the arrival of a drifter, (Vince Vaughn), life changes for many residents of the small town. He gets hired on by the local feed ranch's owner, an aging drunken widow (Kate Capshaw). Clay, the drifter, quickly becomes her new lover, and in the process, also befriends her quiet teen aged son ""Flyboy"" (Jeremy Davies). The boy hasn't spoken a word in years and is completely withdrawn since the death of his father. He only speaks to his pet bull. Clay tries to get the boy out of his shell, much to the chagrin of the boy's mother. Clay doesn't understand what's going on, but soon it is all revealed and Clay realizes he's stumbled into a hornet's nest.The acting is superb and the craftsmanship of the film is excellent. Ashley Judd and Paul Rudd also appear in smaller, but pivotal roles. This is a fine film.I still swear it has to be a Williams' play.....",4,Incredible film!,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,1289,"['are', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'fan', 'Locusts', 'must', 'have', 'film', 'collection', 'No', 'not', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be.Certainly', 'owing', 'great', 'debt', 'masterful', 'Southern', 'playwright', 'film', 'elements', 'one', 'Williams', 'plays', 'heat', 'rural', 'locale', 'unspoken', 'mystery', 'sexy', 'male', 'drifter', 'faded', 'Southern', 'belle.The', 'Locusts', 'place', '1950', 'arrival', 'drifter', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'life', 'changes', 'many', 'residents', 'small', 'town', 'hired', 'local', 'feed', 'ranch', 'owner', 'aging', 'drunken', 'widow', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'Clay', 'drifter', 'quickly', 'new', 'lover', 'process', 'also', 'quiet', 'teen', 'aged', 'son', 'Flyboy', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'boy', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'word', 'years', 'completely', 'withdrawn', 'death', 'father', 'only', 'pet', 'bull', 'Clay', 'get', 'boy', 'shell', 'much', 'chagrin', 'boy', 'mother', 'Clay', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'soon', 'revealed', 'Clay', 'stumbled', 'hornet', 'nest.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'craftsmanship', 'film', 'excellent', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'also', 'appear', 'smaller', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'fine', 'film.I', 'still', 'swear', 'be', 'Williams', 'play', '..']",N/A

Vince Vaughn gives a stellar performance as a mysterious drifter who shows up in Sealy, Texas and takes a job as a ranch hand on a beef farm run by cold and seductive Kate Capshaw.  Capshaw's husband committed suicide after finding his wife making out with a ranchhand.  Their impressionable 13 year old son was then committed to a mental home after breaking down from the tragedy.  He is now 21 and is superbly emobided by the underrated Jeremy Davies.Vaughn establishes a relationship with him and also steals the girlfriend of a fellow employee.  Ashley Judd shines as the girl who wants to settle down with Vince, but doesn't know he has a shady past.  The movie's biggest drawback is the lackluster performance of Capshaw; she is lethargic and a more energetic actress would have made her character more devastating.Nonetheless, with Davies and Vaughn especially good, the movie is worth a look, but it is rather depressing.",3,DARK SHADOWS,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,996,"['LOCUSTS', 'downbeat', 'film', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'stellar', 'performance', 'mysterious', 'drifter', 'who', 'up', 'Sealy', 'Texas', 'job', 'ranch', 'hand', 'beef', 'farm', 'run', 'cold', 'seductive', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'Capshaw', 'husband', 'committed', 'suicide', 'finding', 'wife', 'making', 'out', 'ranchhand', 'impressionable', '13', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'was', 'then', 'committed', 'mental', 'home', 'breaking', 'down', 'tragedy', 'now', '21', 'superbly', 'emobided', 'underrated', 'Jeremy', 'Davies.Vaughn', 'relationship', 'also', 'girlfriend', 'fellow', 'employee', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'shines', 'girl', 'who', 'settle', 'down', 'Vince', ""n't"", 'know', 'shady', 'past', 'movie', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'Capshaw', 'lethargic', 'more', 'energetic', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'character', 'more', 'devastating.Nonetheless', 'Davies', 'Vaughn', 'especially', 'good', 'movie', 'look', 'rather', 'depressing']",N/A
684269,A179GX8E3M4G52,B00005UJYB,"Mr D. ""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[5, 8]","I have a thing about Ashley Judd. She is one of my favorite actresses so it's not surprising that I look for her movies. Last night I watched `The Locusts,' a slow moving movie of high drama set in rural Missouri and of course featuring Ashley Judd as Kitty, who was actually supporting actress to, Kate Capshaw who played Delilah Ashford Potts.The way the story goes, the widow Potts owns Ashford farm, a cattle feed farm, employing many of the area's young men and occasionally taking one of them as her lover.Clay Hewitt (Vince Vaughn), a drifter, is hired by Potts, who has plans for him but he takes up instead with Kitty. He also makes friends with his boss's twenty-one year old mute son, Flyboy (Jeremy Davies) and with persistence begins to bring him out of his shell.Reputedly, thirteen year old Flyboy found his father hanging from a tree and had been institutionalized until recently, where he went home and became the cook. Flyboy wouldn't talk and performed his duties with his gaze diverted and the widow Pott's seemed to like it that way. When Clay befriended her son, Pott's seemed to resent it and started to do mean things. This ultimately ended in tragedy.ConclusionAlthough the story didn't particularly grab me, there was some damn good acting here. No not from my sweetheart Ashley Judd, though she did alright. Both Vince Vaughn and Jeremy Davies played their characters to a tee and put on great performances. Even Paul Rudd did his character proud.The story centered around Flyboy and Clay's efforts to get him to open up. Fly boy ostensibly discovered his has father hanging from a tree after committing suicide. The alleged reason he killed himself was that he once often found his serial adulteress wife in his bed with a lover.Neither the plot, story, time period (late 50's) or setting were particularly compelling for me. Nevertheless, the movie was well directed, the cast was well chosen and they did a commendable job.

684270,A31AF65HNP73TP,B00005UJYB,Munga,"[2, 2]","Although the subject line is very dark and hopeless, the acting was over the top.  I have never seen Vince Vaughn more beautiful and passionate... This is the first movie I saw him in and it caused me to want to see all his movies thereafter.  Now, it seems, he is bent toward more comical and silly films.  Still, in this movie he gives a performance full of presence.  One might even compare him to a young Paul Newman or dare I say?.... even Brando? It must have been the 'wife beater' shirts...Jeremy Davies plays the part of a broken [but gentle] man-child, with grace.  His presence in each scene will only incite the most empathetic of all virtues from the viewer.  Truly, I wanted only to save him and it was frustrating to see the tragic turn of events that was to seal his doom.  It is my observation that Jeremy goes on to play many roles similar to this one.Kate Capshaw is nothing less than brilliant and persuasive.  She conveys the epitome of the evil human being; so full of selfishness; a soul completely absent of conscience; a mother completely devoid of maternal feelings... ""Mommy Dearest"" will seem like a walk in the park compared to Kate's character.I believe this movie is worth watching.  The lack of hope and the onslaught of sorrow might have you feeling empty; much the way reading, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" may make you feel, but it's truly a movie that deserved a closer look.  I can't imagine why this isn't to become one on the list of classics.I disagree with the criticisms that others have given this movie in the previous reviews.  The attempts at compassion and befriending may be shallow (and indeed they are) but they are no different than those attempts in the movie ""Of Mice and Men"".  There is reason for this, I believe.  The strength is in the main characters and their own private hell... no so much in their intamacy with each other.",4,Outstanding Acting,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,1877,"['subject', 'line', 'very', 'dark', 'hopeless', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'more', 'beautiful', 'passionate', 'first', 'movie', 'saw', 'caused', 'want', 'see', 'movies', 'thereafter', 'Now', 'bent', 'more', 'comical', 'silly', 'films', 'Still', 'movie', 'performance', 'full', 'presence', 'One', 'might', 'even', 'compare', 'young', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'dare', 'say', 'even', 'Brando', 'must', 'have', 'been', ""'wife"", 'beater', 'shirts', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'part', 'broken', '[', 'gentle', ']', 'man-child', 'grace', 'presence', 'scene', 'will', 'only', 'incite', 'most', 'empathetic', 'virtues', 'viewer', 'Truly', 'wanted', 'only', 'save', 'was', 'frustrating', 'see', 'tragic', 'turn', 'events', 'was', 'seal', 'doom', 'observation', 'Jeremy', 'play', 'many', 'roles', 'similar', 'one.Kate', 'Capshaw', 'nothing', 'less', 'brilliant', 'persuasive', 'conveys', 'epitome', 'evil', 'human', 'being', 'full', 'selfishness', 'soul', 'completely', 'absent', 'conscience', 'mother', 'completely', 'devoid', 'maternal', 'feelings', 'Mommy', 'Dearest', 'will', 'seem', 'walk', 'park', 'compared', 'Kate', 'character.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'lack', 'hope', 'onslaught', 'sorrow', 'might', 'have', 'feeling', 'empty', 'much', 'way', 'reading', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'may', 'make', 'feel', 'truly', 'movie', 'deserved', 'closer', 'look', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', ""n't"", 'become', 'one', 'list', 'classics.I', 'disagree', 'criticisms', 'others', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'previous', 'reviews', 'attempts', 'compassion', 'befriending', 'may', 'be', 'shallow', 'indeed', 'are', 'are', 'different', 'attempts', 'movie', 'Mice', 'Men', 'reason', 'believe', 'strength', 'main', 'characters', 'own', 'private', 'hell', 'so', 'much', 'intamacy', 'other']",N/A

It'sthe story of how everyone is unique, each person has their ownstrengths and weaknesses, life experiences, socialpressures and too often, people have only a limitedroad on which they can walk, on the path of Life and Work.Clearly, Vince Vaughn is at his best in this movie,feeling at ease and natural in the role of an ""olderbrother"" to another individual, who is stigmatized,psychologically impaired, and physically disabled, named Flyboy.The character is played convincingly by Jeremy Davies, whoperhaps some may underestimate, considering the later valuable role inSpielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Kate Capshaw, does a fine job.Some have noted the manic, omnipresent ""smoking"" of thismovie, which defies explanation. Perhaps it's just adevice that was seen as having worked well in theearlier movie, with Judd too, SMOKE, perhaps the director decidedto employ it in LOCUSTS as well.The most difficult to believe part, is when Vaughn, atotal stranger to a small town, hooks up, and gets hiredon the basis of one beer, in the local tavern. However,for the remainder of the movie, all the scenes areextremely believable and the story unfolds convincingly, thuscaptivating the viewers' attentions.Overall, what makes this movie succeed, is the charm and""utopia"" of another time and space, perhaps 200 years ago,of a small town, in rural America, aside from thetragic, and insidious story underpinning how Flyboy'shumanity was destroyed as a child, for example. Other aspectsthat many will find interesting, is the libido betweenVaughn and the girls on the farm, including Ashley Judd,the unease felt by the other men feel in face of all of this, thetension of a new hired hand joining the group, learningan entirely new, and unappetizing profession, and more.LOCUSTS simply takes the viewer on a trip for 90 minutes,and as such is a valuable addition to a collection.

They just don't make movies like this anymore. Very Tennessee Williams-feeling. The cast was superb-with one exception. Kate Capshaw just plain sucks in this film. Her delivery is so flat you'd think she was reading from cue cards. Thankfully, this wonderful drama is saved by the rest of the cast. Vince Vaughn is dreamy, like a young Elvis, you can feel the heat coming off the screen from this guy, and it makes me wonder why he is routinely cast in goofy comedies these days. It's a shame, because he nailed this role. Jeremy Davies is excellent, in a role that could make or break this film, he makes it and then some. Beautifully shot, interesting story, first rate acting (except Capshaw).

684278,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B00005UJYB,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[0, 2]","""The Locusts"" can be summed up (perhaps unfairly) as ""Vince Vaughn ain't Paul Newman"".The writer and director, John Patrick Kelley, obviously loves degenerate Southern melodrama. And as I strongly believe in ""learning through imitation"", I have no right to criticize him for attempting to reproduce the kind of film he enjoys. But that doesn't mean ""The Locusts"" is successful.""The Locusts"" is a mechanical copy of plays and films from an era Kelley (probably) hasn't lived through. It's noteworthy that Kelley has a character talk about ""the parameters of a relationship"", something no one outside academia would have said in 1960 (assuming /anyone/ said it). When Flyboy asks Clay if he wants to hear one of his late father's records, it's an LP, not a 78. And how dumb can you be to name the villainess ""Mrs Potts""? (Angela Lansbury would likely have played the part more-convincingly than Kate Capshaw.)The ending is poorly motivated and ludicrously overwrought, more likely to provoke laughter than tears.With the exception of Jeremy Davies' Flyboy, the performances are uniformly flat and uninteresting. The writing is uneven and the direction uninspired; the actors wind up looking bad. The photography is similarly dull and devoid of atmosphere.If you're new to screenwriting (as I am), I nevertheless encourage you to see ""The Locusts"", as a outstanding example of how /not/ to write a genre film.",2,lacking all conviction...,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,1406,"['Locusts', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'perhaps', 'unfairly', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Paul', 'Newman', '.The', 'writer', 'director', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Kelley', 'obviously', 'degenerate', 'Southern', 'melodrama', 'strongly', 'believe', 'learning', 'imitation', 'have', 'right', 'criticize', 'attempting', 'reproduce', 'kind', 'film', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Locusts', 'successful', 'Locusts', 'mechanical', 'copy', 'plays', 'films', 'era', 'Kelley', 'probably', ""n't"", 'lived', 'noteworthy', 'Kelley', 'character', 'talk', 'parameters', 'relationship', 'something', 'one', 'outside', 'academia', 'would', 'have', 'said', '1960', 'assuming', '/anyone/', 'said', 'When', 'Flyboy', 'Clay', 'hear', 'one', 'late', 'father', 'records', 'LP', 'not', '78', 'how', 'dumb', 'can', 'be', 'name', 'villainess', 'Mrs', 'Potts', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'more-convincingly', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'ending', 'poorly', 'motivated', 'ludicrously', 'overwrought', 'more', 'likely', 'provoke', 'laughter', 'tears.With', 'exception', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Flyboy', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'flat', 'uninteresting', 'writing', 'uneven', 'direction', 'uninspired', 'actors', 'wind', 'up', 'looking', 'bad', 'photography', 'similarly', 'dull', 'devoid', 'atmosphere.If', ""'re"", 'new', 'screenwriting', 'am', 'nevertheless', 'encourage', 'see', 'Locusts', 'outstanding', 'example', 'how', '/not/', 'write', 'genre', 'film']",N/A
