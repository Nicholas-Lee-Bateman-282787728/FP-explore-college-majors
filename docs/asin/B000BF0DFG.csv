941528,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B000BF0DFG,Happy Reader,"[5, 5]","This is Set Three out of six total Collection Sets. Set Three has six ""Inspector Morse"" episodes. The first four episodes are the BBC Series 4 in its entirety. (The BBC uses ""series"" instead of ""seasons"".) The last two episodes are the beginning, in the same order, of the BBC Series 5. I think the middle four episodes are some of the best of ""Inspector Morse"" EVER![Note: You don't want to confuse the six ""Collection Sets"" with a newer run of ""Inspector Morse"" DVD's, called simply ""Sets"". There are eleven ""Sets"", called ""Inspector Morse Set One"", and so on. Each ""Set"" has only three episodes on three discs.]Episodes:The Infernal Serpent - first aired January 1990The Sins of the Fathers - aired January 1990Driven to Distraction - aired January 1990Masonic Mysteries - aired January 1990Second Time Around - aired February 1991Fat Chance - aired February 1991THE INFERNAL SERPENT:A young man is forced into a car. He's protesting he won't do ""it"", but it doesn't look like he has any choice. Later, it's raining hard as people leave a Beaufort College debate late at night. One of them, Dr. Julian Dear, is attacked. His colleague, Headmaster Matthew Copley-Barnes, shows up just in time to see the the apparent assailant's face, we know it's the young man forced into the car. Dr. Dear dies, making it murder, and Morse and Lewis are stumped.The next day, celebrated journalist Sylvia Maxton arrives at the Headmaster's house. After her father died, when just a girl, she moved in with Blanche and Matthew Copley-Barnes. But something is wrong with this homecoming. She hasn't been in contact for a long 17 years. The air crackles with pent animosity - but why? It's an umbrella and a photograph that help solve the mysteries.Trivia: This episode was written by Alma Cullen based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. The episode title is from ""Paradise Lost"" by John Milton.THE SINS OF THE FATHERS:A man finishes typing a letter in his office. He scrunches up the carbon paper, throwing it away, and then burns another letter in an ashtray. The next we see of him, it's his dead body, found the next day by a worker. Lewis rushes into Morse's office exclaiming, ""You'll never believe this, Sir. We have to visit a brewery!""They troop over to the Radford Brewery, a proud old name in the brewing business. Charles Radford tells them that his brother, the recently deceased Trevor Radford, had been working late on a ""defense document"". Farmers was bidding to take over the family-held brewery, and Trevor was against it. The police discover that the newly used carbon paper was of a letter dated 1986, four years before. Stranger still, when Morse goes to tell Trevor's wife there's bad news, she looks at him and asks, ""Someone died? Is it Charles?"" Now why would she worry first about Charles instead of Trevor?This story is a Greek tragedy, told with excellent acting, both understated and in-your-face.Trivia: This episode was written by Jeremy Burnham based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Using an electric typewriter and carbon paper dates it. But that's the only thing that does, for it's a timeless tale of rotten family dynamics and secrets passed from parent to son.DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION:Chief Superintendent Strange (consistently marvelous performances by James Grout) is beside himself. There's been two similar brutal murders, and the police have no leads whatsoever. Now, the viewer knows who the killer is. Sort of. He wears old black leather gloves, drives a stickshift, keeps duct tape in his glove compartment, and plays the Cole Porter songs, ""You Do Something to Me"" and ""Why Can't You Behave"" while stalking his prey. Creepy.Persistence pays off, though, when Morse and Lewis discover that both women had one thing in common, a car dealership owned by the too-slick Jeremy Boynton. Morse is so sure that Boynton's the murderer, he risks his career on harassing the dealer, and, at one point, Lewis says he just can't follow him there. Boy, this is a great episode.Trivia: This episode is written by Anthony Minghella based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, Kevin Whately says, ""If we'd got on like a house on fire as characters, it would have made it dull and flat.""MASONIC MYSTERIES:Morse drives Beryl Newsome to the full dress rehearsal of the Oxford amateur production of ""The Magic Flute"", where they're both in the chorus. Morse wants to get to know her better, but she's sharp with him, saying, ""I've just had enough of men for the moment."" Unfortunately, a fellow thespian, Sandra, is eavesdropping.After getting in their costumes, Beryl is called away for a phone call. At the same time, the dresser sends Morse back because he's missing his medallion, part of his costume. While Morse is backstage getting his medallion, Beryl is finding out that there's no one on the phone. ""Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?"" You're getting a bad feeling about this.Sure enough, not only is Beryl stabbed to death while holding the phone, but Morse is the one to find her. In his shock, he actually picks up the knife. Naturally, Sandra is only too happy to tell the police that Morse appeared to be forcing his attentions on Beryl.To his anger, Morse is pulled off the case and is a suspect. Remember Morse's Law from ""The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn""? There's always a 50/50 chance that the man who found the body, did the deed. Lewis, however, is still on the case, working with Chief Inspector Bottomly. Bottomly talks to a very uncomfortable Lewis, ""Look Lewis... What's his, um, sex life been all these years? And, people do sometimes, suddenly, if they're disgruntled or humiliated, perhaps ... (pregnant pause) He drinks a lot, doesn't he?""Who is framing Morse? Is it a nemesis from the past? Because soon another person close to Morse is killed.Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell based on the characters created by Colin Dexter.SECOND TIME AROUND:Charlie Hillian is retiring from the Thames Valley CID and writing a book. They give him a big send-off party and Charlie drinks too much. Chief Inspector Patrick Dawson used to be at Thames Valley. He and his wife came from London to see Charlie off into retirement. They take Charlie home after the party, and settle him on the couch before leaving for their hotel.The next morning, Mrs. Keelan, Charlie's housekeeper, finds Charlie on the floor, dead, a window broken and the desk rifled. Morse and Lewis are on the case, but Dawson begs to be allowed to help, knowing it's not his jurisdiction. What can Morse do but say ""Yes"" - everybody is furious that one of their own, and a popular one at that, was struck down.It looks like this is not a simple burglary gone wrong. The only thing missing is the chapter of Charlie's book that covered an unsolved murder from years before. There are numerous suspects, and this well-told tale has a surprise and a little heartbreak that I didn't see coming.Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. This episode has a lovely small part for Sam Kelly, who plays Walter Majors, Charlie's ghostwriter, with metaphysical rumpledness.In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, John Thaw says this about his character, Morse: ""The puzzle of solving a murder is what sort of drives him on. And when that's gone and he's solved that particular clue, then he's back to reality. And he doesn't like the reality of it. I think that's probably why he drinks. More than most.""FAT CHANCE:Back to Oxford college for this episode. Victoria, her arm in a sling, is sitting for her Divinity Examination. She is dressed in a cleric's black robe as a political statement. She is a member of The PAX Group, headed by Hilary Dobson, a group working towards women's ordination in the Church of England. In the middle of her exam, Veronica stands up, obviously unwell, and falls to the floor dead.She's been poisoned, and the first question for Morse and Lewis is, how was she poisoned? She took communion just before the test, administered by a chaplain and priest virulently opposed to the goals of the PAX Group. The priest, Jeffry, rifled her room while she was at the exam.But a Morse murder can't be that simple! PAX runs a hostel for young women, where Victoria was counselor to the troubled and overweight Dinah. Dinah has gone into hiding. She had been taking part in the trial of an experimental weight-loss supplement at a local fat farm. Mr. Gold, odious owner of the spa, asks his pet scientist, Hank, ""You say the fat woman's on the loose again?"" Hank: ""Who listens to fat women? Especially when they have no evidence.""Trivia: ""Fat Chance"" was written by Alma Cullen, based on characters created by Colin Dexter. This episode seems ahead of it's time, with it's commentary on body image.",5,Episode Synopsis of Some of the Very Best of Inspector Morse!
