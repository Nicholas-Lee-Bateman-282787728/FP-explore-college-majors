928367,A2ZBFVSY21EMZN,B000AM4PFY,"Jesse Penitent ""zekaille""","[8, 9]","I bought this at Wal-Mart for $5.00 and change.  For that price, I don't mind that most of the stories were...well...boring. Curiously four of the stories weren't actually predictable...but they were, well, boring.  On the other hand, the story that WAS predictable was also the most interesting to watch and that one really was worth the five dollars I spent.In order of exellence:Crevices:  If you couldn't see where this was going, you have never seen a horror movie.  On the other hand, this was the only one to create a genuine atmosphere of pure terror and creepiness.  I slept with the lights on that night, even though I knew the lights wouldn't protect me.5 BIG starsSpiderwoman:  Despite what folks have said about the ""bad"" CGI, I found it acceptable.  The big reveal of the Spiderwoman (and her rapid fast movements) was on the chilling side, but I found much scarier the non-CGI effects that simply used camera trickery to make you THINK you were seeing extra arms and legs.  The urban legend motif was just silly.  3 stars.Presentiment:  Annoying, but has a good (if rather expected) twist 3/4 in.  And there is a second twist that isn't as shocking but does take you by surprise.  The acting, however, was over the top.  Or maybe I just don't understand Japanese culture.  Two and a half stars.Sacrifice:  Weeeellll...who cared, really?  Lots of camera cuts and people staring hard at something only they can see...but it all adds up to a mother-daughter bond and a giant head straight out of the old Muppet skits on SNL.  Felt as if it had been cobbled together from various ideas that weren't good to start. 1 and a half stars.Blond Kwaidan:  Huh?  Not even bad enough to laugh at.  Almost no set up: just an obnoxious man with a thing for blonds and....a blond who may be dead.  Or not.  Yeeeeccccchhhhh. Negative Million stars.To summarize:  even though it's less that ten minutes long, ""Crevices"" is a compact, neat little chiller that is, indeed, worth the cash you have to lay out to get it.  The rest is eminently skippable.",3,For a Five Dollar Movie....,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,2047,"['bought', 'Wal-Mart', '5.00', 'change', 'price', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'most', 'stories', 'were', 'well', 'boring', 'Curiously', 'four', 'stories', 'were', ""n't"", 'actually', 'predictable', 'were', 'well', 'boring', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'WAS', 'predictable', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'interesting', 'watch', 'one', 'really', 'was', 'five', 'dollars', 'spent.In', 'order', 'exellence', 'Crevices', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'horror', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'create', 'genuine', 'atmosphere', 'pure', 'terror', 'creepiness', 'slept', 'lights', 'night', 'even', 'knew', 'lights', 'would', ""n't"", 'protect', 'me.5', 'BIG', 'starsSpiderwoman', 'what', 'folks', 'have', 'said', 'bad', 'CGI', 'found', 'acceptable', 'big', 'reveal', 'Spiderwoman', 'rapid', 'fast', 'movements', 'was', 'chilling', 'side', 'found', 'much', 'scarier', 'non-CGI', 'effects', 'simply', 'used', 'camera', 'trickery', 'make', 'THINK', 'were', 'seeing', 'extra', 'arms', 'legs', 'urban', 'legend', 'motif', 'was', 'just', 'silly', '3', 'stars.Presentiment', 'Annoying', 'good', 'rather', 'expected', 'twist', '3/4', 'second', 'twist', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'take', 'surprise', 'acting', 'however', 'was', 'top', 'maybe', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Two', 'half', 'stars.Sacrifice', 'Weeeellll', 'who', 'cared', 'really', 'Lots', 'camera', 'cuts', 'people', 'staring', 'hard', 'something', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'up', 'mother-daughter', 'bond', 'giant', 'head', 'straight', 'old', 'Muppet', 'SNL', 'Felt', 'had', 'been', 'cobbled', 'together', 'various', 'ideas', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'start', '1', 'half', 'stars.Blond', 'Kwaidan', 'Huh', 'Not', 'even', 'bad', 'enough', 'laugh', 'Almost', 'set', 'up', 'just', 'obnoxious', 'man', 'thing', 'blonds', '.a', 'blond', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'dead', 'not', 'Yeeeeccccchhhhh', 'Negative', 'Million', 'stars.To', 'summarize', 'even', 'less', 'ten', 'minutes', 'long', 'Crevices', 'compact', 'neat', 'little', 'chiller', 'indeed', 'cash', 'have', 'lay', 'out', 'get', 'rest', 'eminently', 'skippable']",N/A
928368,ADF5Q9UJ6FWOC,B000AM4PFY,Lil' E,"[1, 2]","As a spoiled American, as soon as i see a movie that is low budget, i dismiss it almost immediately. But in this case, i gave it a chance, i survived the first horrible ""Spiderwoman"" short and im glad i pulled through! the rest of the stories were actually pretty good! like, i was legitimately scared at some points in the movie and at the very least, constantly freaked out. each short is only like 20 minutes long, which is good because it keeps things interesting, pulls you in just enough, delivers the climatic/scary blow, then moves you into a new, different story. It reminds me of an Asian version of Campfire Tales, a movie of short stories, really scary/creepy. So yes, this movie is kind of low budget, not the worst quality though, some pretty decent acting and effects, stories that definately give you goosebumps. I really liked it, because each story was so varied from the last and it's just a good change of pace, instead of trying to force a 2 hr long barely-scary movie down your throat, it gives just a few short scary stories to work with. It gives you a little taste of japanese culture too. all around, a good flick to check out.",3,Low Budget but Good Quality!,1239926400,"04 17, 2009",2009,1153,"['spoiled', 'American', 'as', 'soon', 'i', 'see', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'i', 'dismiss', 'almost', 'immediately', 'case', 'i', 'gave', 'chance', 'i', 'survived', 'first', 'horrible', 'Spiderwoman', 'short', 'im', 'glad', 'i', 'pulled', 'rest', 'stories', 'were', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'i', 'was', 'legitimately', 'scared', 'points', 'movie', 'very', 'least', 'constantly', 'freaked', 'out', 'short', 'only', 'like', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'good', 'things', 'interesting', 'pulls', 'just', 'enough', 'climatic/scary', 'blow', 'then', 'new', 'different', 'story', 'Asian', 'version', 'Campfire', 'Tales', 'movie', 'short', 'stories', 'really', 'scary/creepy', 'So', 'yes', 'movie', 'kind', 'low', 'budget', 'not', 'worst', 'quality', 'pretty', 'decent', 'acting', 'effects', 'stories', 'definately', 'give', 'goosebumps', 'really', 'liked', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'varied', 'last', 'just', 'good', 'change', 'pace', 'instead', 'trying', 'force', '2', 'hr', 'long', 'barely-scary', 'movie', 'throat', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'scary', 'stories', 'work', 'little', 'taste', 'japanese', 'culture', 'too', 'around', 'good', 'flick', 'check', 'out']",N/A
