This one's no different in that almost every element is at least a little different than what Stephenie Meyer wrote in the related book. I did notice in BD part 1 that some of the small details, such as during Renesmee's delivery were there but not explained, which will possibly confuse someone who hasn't read the book, (it's still bloody though).I got the two disc edition, everyone should, for the extras- and found that what few deleted scenes there are will be found buried in the documentary feature (Alice calling Bella, Edward showing Bella how many eggs she'd eaten during honeymoon serve as examples) and that there are no music videos.It all looks very good, will probably satisfy most fans and irritate the critics, worth viewing.

1260931,A242ZUQE305G8C,B002BWP49C,A.Dream,"[0, 1]","For those of you who have read the books, it's kind of required to watch the movies. Even though we all know the movie is never as good as the book, we still have hope. Now, if you're in it just to see the cool graphics, clothes, compare your vision to real-life, then fine, this should be a lovely movie for you. You know what's going on and you are prepared to judge the movie.The real test of a book-gone-bigsceen film is if people would still watch it even if the book hadn't been famous beforehand. (Alice In Wonderland, anyone? Eragon?). Sadly, I do not believe this series of films would be a success in that case. If you completely ignore the books, the movie is decent. The graphics are good, but they aren't seamless. You can tell what is fake, and you can see it not matching perfectly with what is real. I'm always annoyed when that happens. It's like those photos you see of people pretending to hold the Statue of Liberty or something in their hand. Yeah it looks cool at first but when you look close it's easy to see you're just holding your hand close to the camera, far away from the object you're pretending to hold.Anyway, if you do factor the books into the equation, the movies really fail. It's not just having a different internal expectation than what is on the screen; it's that basic facts were completely overlooked. What's rule number one of Cullen world? Everyone is perfect. But does that hold true in the movies? Nope! I see sunspots/moles, acne, and general non-attractiveness. Makeup and airbrushing could have solved that, but no one did it. Rule number two? They aren't human. So why do they tremble? Why do their hands shake ever so slightly when they pick things up, just like humans do? Some brushups could have covered that. The whole feel is supposed to be inhuman, but that just doesn't come across at all. Even when they park their cars it isn't perfect. They're just as crooked as the other 'humans'. Again, easy to fix, yet it wasn't done. Ruins the whole effect for me. I expect attentention to detail, and it just isn't there.Next, we move onto errors. Obviously movie people can't just take the book and make it into a movie. That would be too simple, right? They have to add and subtract their own scenes until it all bears just a passing resemblence to the books. Which is fine if you're approaching the movies without first reading the books, but since most of us have all ready read the books...Finally, the actual characters. They fail. Sorry. Let's start with Bella. I've all ways liked Bella. She can be a little whiny, but other than that she's great. She's supposed to be sweet, innocent. Wanting to help everyone and everything. The movie? She's a tough little tomboy. There is no sweetness their. She's like the tough girl in highschool everyone knew, smoking out behind the school,  out playin' with the boys all the time. Decent girl, but all ways took herself too seriously. We all knew she'd marry a redneck and spend her days howling at her pack of sons whenever they got to roughhousing, cigarette hanging from her fingers. This is not the Belle portrayed in the book. But it's what you get in the movies.Next we have Edward. He's the same way. You expect Mr. Proper, and you get wanna-be tough chick's boyfriend. His speech is not what you'd expect from a man who was born a century ago. I mean, I don't expect him to be proper at all times, but he at least has to know how to do it when needed, and you just don't get the sense that he does. There's no 'ancient' feel. He isn't special.Moving onto Alice. Seriously, what happened? Tiny little pixie girl has turned into normal sized girl. I mean, she's taller than Bella at times! There's nothing pixie-like about her at all. She's average.Now Carlisle is someone I like. I think his character fits the part very well. His features can convey the sense of perfection the vampires so needed. You actually get an inhuman feel from him.As for the wolves, eh. Graphics could have been better. I've seen better work with dragons, and I'm fairly certain dragons are harder to create than a wolf. You rarely get the feeling that the wolves are really 'there'. They dont' mesh together with the real characters. It breaks the effect.The graphics and sounds were something I expected to be perfection. They weren't. Whenever anyone jumps up to a window, you get this horrible 'whoosh'ing sound, and the graphics fail to make it look real. The running is so terribly awkward as well. I don't care if they think it's how it looks. It just doesn't look real. Believable.And that's about it for the facts that were missed. :D I won't bother to get into how my personal visions didn't match with the big screen. :)",4,"If you know the books, watch.

1260934,A1NMHU4RJZO1GW,B002BWP49C,A. Hollett,"[9, 17]","I haven't liked this series from the very beginning. Unfortunately, I have been subjected to each movie by my wife so, alas, I have seen it. There are so many bad parts about this movie it's hard to know where to start. That being said, I'll go chrnologically:Let's start with the wedding. Yes, yes, it was a lovely setting and everything, but I have once rather important question. If the wdding is taking place in the middle of the day why are none of the sparkly vampires SPARKLING? I hate the whole sparkling vampire schtick to begin with, but at least stay true to the storyline if that's the backstory in the books. Then, at the reception, why did I feel like I was watching a bad sitcom with the various cheesy toasts?Fast forward to the honeymoon. This was your stereotypical happy honeymoon couple doing honeymoon things. I won't go into the wedding night thing because honestly it wasn't all that remarkable. So he broke the headboard and in the morning the room was trashed. Big deal. Yet, once again, they'e playing around in the middle of a sunny, cloudless day and nary a sparkle from the sparkly vamapire. I guess they burned up their special effects budget on the CSI/House biology sequences. Then, when Bella discovers she's pregnant, some native woman starts babbling in hr native tongue, only there's no translation (at least not on the copy that I watched) so no one has any clue what she's even saying since Edaward doesn't bother to translate for Bella.Back to Forks and now we're treated to Bella starting to look thinner and more ghastly. Interestingly enough, my wife remarked about how much better Kristen Stewart looked in the beginning of the movie compared to all of the other movies. My explanation was instantaneous, having already known the plot: It's so when they make her look sunken and withdrawn from the fetus people would actually notice a change in her appearance. Low and behold, the first time we see Bella starting to feel the effects of the fetus feeding off her body, she looked just like she had in the previous three movies.So, for the next hour and a half we're treated to the vampires freaking out trying to figure out how this baby can be born and not kill Bella, Jacob leapfrogging back and forth between dealing with losing Bella and becoming friends with the vamps to hating them and back again, and the werewolves saying that because Bella's pregnant and that's never happene before so, of course, everyone in that house has to die. Oh, and isn't it just a coincidence that the vampires hadn't fed in weeks so they're just a tad bit hungry. How interesting that none of them go blood crazy when the O negative starts getting poured into a shake for Bella yet during the final C-section scene it's game on.That, of course, leads us to the ""climax"". First of all, I seriously question the logic behind the decision that the skilled physician should be the one to make the blood bank run and leave a bunch of untrained morons behind to take care of a nearly dead Bella. This, of course, leads us to the ""bloody"" C-section scene. Honestly, a huge deal was made about this being such a bloody and grotesque scene, but I've seen worse on primetime dramas like CSI, House, and Bones. Sure, they showed a tiny section of either intestine or bowel, but no where near as bloody as all of the reviews made it out to be when it first came out. Now, if reviewers had said the bloodiest in the series, then I could understand it. Also, why did they (either the screen writers or Stephanie Moyer herself) have a completely untrained, blonde bimbo performing the C-section? Yes, when my wife is in a life or death situation regarding birth, I want the scalpel handed off to the completely untrained blonde woman and have her hack away. I know this is only fiction, but come on now.The end of the movie was just annoying. Jacob imprinting on the baby (can you say pedophile boys and girls?), the ""fight"" between the vamps and wolves, and the incredibly annoying wait to see if it worked. Oh yes, I was certainly on the edge of my seat waiting to see just what happened. Would Bella really come back from the dead as a sparkly vampire, or is it too late and she's already dead (fingers crossed on that one). Who cares that it's already given away since this movie was called ""Breaking Dawn: Part 1"", maybe they'll make part two and have no Bella in it. Yeah, that's it. Then, FINALLY, Bella opens her eyes and they're red, roll credits. Oooooo, how suspensful. Even the credits looked completely B movie in style. I thought this was supposed to be a blockbuster film. Couldn't they drop a couple of bucks on the font at least?In a nutshell, this was a pathetic attempt at stretching about 30 minutes of story into a two and a half hour movie and failing miserably.

1260935,AAZRWLML88IZK,B002BWP49C,A kids review,"[5, 20]","Stephenie Meyer's vampire-human-werewolf romance has captured the female demographic since the first book was published back in 2005, and the film adaptations have understandably been a huge hit as well. The latest chapter in the saga, which amounts to the first half of the final book, debuted last November to the tune of over $280 million in domestic totals and a worldwide gross exceeding $700 million. By now, it's well known that the Twilight films aren't very good, but that didn't stop hordes of fans from watching the marriage of Bella and Edward, the subsequent consummation of that marriage, and the ensuing complications that arise when a human attempts to birth a vampire. Even within the franchise itself, Breaking Dawn Part I is the worst, it's slow, joyless, and loaded with unintentionally hilarious moments. But let's be honest: this film was made exclusively to satisfy its existing fanbase, who are only too eager to eat it up; everyone else will have to be content with the fact that there's only one more to go.",1,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part I,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,1033,"['Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'vampire-human-werewolf', 'romance', 'captured', 'female', 'demographic', 'first', 'book', 'was', 'published', 'back', '2005', 'film', 'adaptations', 'have', 'understandably', 'been', 'huge', 'hit', 'as', 'well', 'latest', 'chapter', 'saga', 'first', 'half', 'final', 'book', 'debuted', 'last', 'November', 'tune', '280', 'million', 'domestic', 'totals', 'worldwide', 'gross', 'exceeding', '700', 'million', 'now', 'well', 'known', 'Twilight', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'hordes', 'fans', 'watching', 'marriage', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'subsequent', 'consummation', 'marriage', 'ensuing', 'complications', 'arise', 'when', 'human', 'attempts', 'birth', 'vampire', 'Even', 'franchise', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', 'worst', 'slow', 'joyless', 'loaded', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'exclusively', 'satisfy', 'existing', 'fanbase', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'too', 'eager', 'eat', 'up', 'everyone', 'else', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'content', 'fact', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'go']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

Yes I sat in the second roll staring up at the big screen and did get vertigo briefly. Yes I liked the movie.Unfortunately, Stephanie Meyer had an ax to grind with lead Robert Pattinson? For some reason, he got all the bad camera angles and he looked less than vampiric. Leaving the freckles noticeably visible on Roberts' back for all to see and mottled shades of unvampiric white on his otherwise acceptable physique. I dare say that perhaps Robert had a moment where he blurted out loud, ""Hi, I'm Stephanie Meyers and I lost 200lbs. on the Nutri-system weight loss diet."" Reminds me why Scott Speedman did'nt reprise his role opposite Kate Beckinsale in UnderWorld due to ticking off Len Weizmann by supposedly going hanky-panky behind the scenes when Len was'nt there?Alas, the Avatar ending in the movie really spoiled it for me. It was just as bad as Gail-ann Hurds' pathetic ending on Walking Dead where the audience is supposed to fall for a ridiculous Bambi scene as the actors so uncharacteristically get caught up in a bizarre touchy feelie moment and egg their young charge to get close to touch a fawn? Oh well, looks like I ain't watching Walking Dead anymore.Another major turning point is the latter books made to film are more diverging from the text. This is not a bad thing given the movie pulls it out except for said ending. Albeit, these changes from the novel are minor deviations that actually add to the viewing enjoyment i.e; Bella naming her baby instead of Jacob? Anyway, can't wait till Part 2 comes out.

1260941,AP29W0C7AQ0QJ,B002BWP49C,Allen Hall,"[6, 8]","This is one of the worst movies I've seen.I know it's sort of the ""in"" thing to hate on Twilight, and there are good reasons for that.  It depicts an abusive relationship between two unlikeable people who have absolutely nothing in common, beyond a sort of warped physical attraction, and tries to convince the reader that this is romantic.  It's been called misogynistic, classist, racist, and ableist, among other -ists, and transphobic.  We could talk about all of this, and more, and many have, but as far as I'm concerned, it all boils down to one thing:It's not entertaining.I only ask one thing from a movie, and that's to be entertained.  It may be cerebral, or melodramatic, or a big, dumb action movie, but as long as it's entertaining, I don't care.  This is why I love Ed Wood, adore The Asylum, and count ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" among my favorites.  Yes, all of these are, technically, of a lower quality than the Twilight series, but I don't care because they entertain me.  The Twilight series does not.The reason for this is a near-total lack of conflict.  Instead, what you get is a fear of the possibility of conflict.  You see, Stephanie Meyer tries to set up her own vampire/werewolf mythos, which is fine, but then she makes an excuse and sets it aside it whenever it would mean the characters would have to deal with the consequences of their actions.  The result is a series 4,000 pages long and almost completely static, and it translates into some truly agonizing movies.""Breaking Dawn: Part 1"" is the worst offender.  It's two hours long.  Absolutely nothing happens for the first hour, apart from some terrible music, at which point the movie's pseudo-conflict finally arrives: Bella gets pregnant.  I will ignore all of the questions this raises about Stephanie Meyer's mythos because, by this point in the series, she's already made so many excuses of her own to ignore it that, frankly, who cares.  Then nothing happens and there are some CG werewolves that are even worse than the music and nothing happens until fifteen minutes to the end, when Bella goes into labor.  The baby breaks her spine, Edward chews it out of her womb, the CG monstrosity posing as an infant is given the world's most embarrassing name, and Jacob turns into a pedophile.  All of this is especially interesting because Stephanie Meyer has said she doesn't watch or read horror because it's icky and that the ""Twilight"" movies had to be PG-13 so she could see them.  I don't like hypocrites.That's it, really.  It's two hours long.  I'd say maybe forty-five minutes of it actually needs to be there.  I only just saw it, and even with the RiffTrax commentary, I was so bored I could barely pay attention.I will say that there are three (3) things worth seeing in this movie:1. Watch it if only to skip the entire movie and see the Volturi scene in the end credits.  The actors clearly don't care.  They're just doing what they want and it's a riot.2. Robert Pattinson's makeup makes him look like he's about to die of alcohol poisoning.3. At the end of Bella's getting-ready-to-have-sex montage, she looks like she's trying to psyche herself up to muck out the pigs.  Seriously, she's finally going to screw this guy she's been trying to screw for three movies, and she looks like she's about to puke.  Being nervous about sex is one thing, but this is just hilarious.",1,So boring not even RiffTrax could save it.,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,3379,"['one', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen.I', 'know', 'sort', 'thing', 'hate', 'Twilight', 'are', 'good', 'reasons', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'two', 'unlikeable', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'common', 'sort', 'warped', 'physical', 'attraction', 'tries', 'convince', 'reader', 'romantic', 'been', 'called', 'misogynistic', 'classist', 'racist', 'ableist', 'other', '-ists', 'transphobic', 'could', 'talk', 'more', 'many', 'have', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'down', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'entertaining.I', 'only', 'ask', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'be', 'entertained', 'may', 'be', 'cerebral', 'melodramatic', 'big', 'dumb', 'action', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'why', 'love', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Asylum', 'count', 'Birdemic', 'Shock', 'Terror', 'favorites', 'Yes', 'are', 'technically', 'lower', 'quality', 'Twilight', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'entertain', 'Twilight', 'series', 'not.The', 'reason', 'near-total', 'lack', 'conflict', 'Instead', 'what', 'get', 'fear', 'possibility', 'conflict', 'see', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'set', 'up', 'own', 'vampire/werewolf', 'mythos', 'fine', 'then', 'excuse', 'would', 'mean', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'deal', 'consequences', 'actions', 'result', 'series', '4,000', 'pages', 'long', 'almost', 'completely', 'static', 'truly', 'agonizing', 'movies', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', '1', 'worst', 'offender', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'Absolutely', 'nothing', 'first', 'hour', 'apart', 'terrible', 'music', 'point', 'movie', 'pseudo-conflict', 'finally', 'Bella', 'pregnant', 'will', 'ignore', 'questions', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'mythos', 'point', 'series', 'already', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'excuses', 'own', 'ignore', 'frankly', 'who', 'Then', 'nothing', 'happens', 'are', 'CG', 'werewolves', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'music', 'nothing', 'happens', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'end', 'when', 'Bella', 'labor', 'baby', 'spine', 'Edward', 'womb', 'CG', 'monstrosity', 'posing', 'infant', 'given', 'world', 'most', 'embarrassing', 'name', 'Jacob', 'pedophile', 'especially', 'interesting', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'said', ""n't"", 'watch', 'read', 'horror', 'icky', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'had', 'be', 'PG-13', 'could', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'really', 'two', 'hours', 'long', ""'d"", 'say', 'maybe', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'actually', 'be', 'there', 'only', 'just', 'saw', 'even', 'RiffTrax', 'commentary', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'could', 'barely', 'pay', 'attention.I', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'three', '3', 'things', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie:1', 'Watch', 'only', 'skip', 'entire', 'movie', 'see', 'Volturi', 'scene', 'end', 'credits', 'actors', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'re"", 'just', 'doing', 'what', 'want', 'riot.2', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'makeup', 'look', 'die', 'alcohol', 'poisoning.3', 'end', 'Bella', 'getting-ready-to-have-sex', 'montage', 'trying', 'psyche', 'up', 'muck', 'out', 'pigs', 'Seriously', 'finally', 'going', 'screw', 'guy', 'been', 'trying', 'screw', 'three', 'movies', 'puke', 'Being', 'nervous', 'sex', 'one', 'thing', 'just', 'hilarious']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

If Stephenie is smart (and we all know that she is) she'll also be writing The Next Installment Starring Renesmee to be released at around the same time!Yes, sigh, alas, I too have become A Member of This Cult and Brewer & Drinker of The Kool-Aid!However, I don't feel too bad because I recently realized a few things about this franchise:The tip-off came in Twilight: New Moon when Alice showed a vision-as-proof to The Volturi of Bella & Edward joyously running in slo-mo and sparkling in the sunlight.I said to myself:""I've seen this before, but where... Oh Yes, NOW I remember where I've seen this before!""This film is the final culmination, yet, This ENTIRE Series of Books and Movies is essentially a A Gen-X/Y/Millenium Version + Re-Telling (with an on-screen love-triangle) of A Previously Told Tale of Super-Empowerment at Life Or Death + Love Story that creates an All-Powerful Male/Female As 100% Equals Super-Powered Duo.1975: The Six Million Dollar Man (Like Edward, himself is created against his will at just such a moment of life or death!) who then goes on to find/create His Ideal Mate via finding her and then upgrading her (At a similar moment of life or death!) The Bionic Woman.2012: Edward Creates Super-Powerful Vampire Queen Bella who will be as Powerful, Better, Stronger, Faster, and Prettier than everyone (Just as he is!) and she then gets to Cheat-Out + Beat + Friend The Super-Model Pretty but Perpetually Miserable/Barren Rosalie by getting knocked-up by Edward in Paradise with The Edward-Baby, Having Her Make The Best A Woman Can Make Grade Super-Baby with The Edward Baby-Batter, and then, after A Dramatic Bout With Death + Revival By Edward + Taking A Nice Long Restorative Nap while her body Heals and is Vampo-Bionically Rebuilt + Super-Model Airbrushed and Tightened-Up via Edward's Own Venom, thus having Bella Feminist Awaken and thus Emerge More Skinny + Super-Model Beautiful + Powerful Than Ever as well as Better, Stronger, and Faster!Obviously, the difference in this variation is that Bella WANTED to become a Vampire anyway, but, Renesmee's Pregnancy and Birth made it so She HAD To Become One in order to survive the experience and not die (for more than a few dramatic moments, of course).And just as what made the SMDM/BW joint + cross-over episodes + follow-up reunion TV movies so fun -- Steve and Jaime In-Love 4-EVA and going power butt-kick with their bionics! -- THE REAL TREAT will be coming in Part 2 when Bella, after 3.5 books and films of co-dependent depression, mooning, whining, and powerlessness gets her guy, has her baby, and then becomes SUPER-Empowered via an Upgrade!  Which is the Life-Journey of many a woman of this species.  This is basically The Story Of The Bionic Woman without the idiotic killing her-off, skipping the 10 years of amnesia, and with her getting married and knocked-up and empowered right away!If she isn't yet, Stephenie Meyer should be laughing her way all the way to the bank since she's essentially scored a Literary, Film, Pop-Cultural and Financial Estro-Feminist Coup + Touchdown with a retelling with her Estro-Maxed-Out and Default Female Bell-Curved retelling of this story that proved to be such a hit in 1975 and now is again in a meaner and sleaker version.  It's actually my contention that the current spat of Vampire-Werewolf + Love-Story Properties is really the culture having a collective unconscious debate of exactly what the correct mix and ratio of Vampire + Werewolf and Male + Female should be in humans going forward.  People love-to-love Underworld because Selene is a non-whiny/co-dependent butt-kicker and love-to-hate Twilight because Bella took 3.5 books and films to get it together before Powering-Up in Part 3.5!The one weakness of the book and movie franchise is that it took so lonnng for Bella to become Vampo-Bionically Powerful and Empowered, to lose the co-dependency, and that (In an almost ripped-off the cover of one of Those Ridiculous Harlequin Novels that are much beloved by Team Va-JJ!) Jacob is her Native American Love-Slave whose Final Reward is: To Lose 1 Girl, Not Get A Suitable + As-Good Replacement, and then to Look After Lost Desired Girl's Daughter For All-Time!This, I would not have minded, if Jacob had Happy-Ending'd with Leah or Someone New FIRST.However, I think WE ALL have A Pretty Good Idea why Stephenie chose to keep Jacob's Dance Card Open for Later Use...Note To Studio:Since you're taking time to Milk This Thing for ALL It'$ Worth, could you also PLEASE Amp-Up and, perhaps, Lord of The Ringsercise THE FINAL BATTLE SEQUENCE so that we the audience get The Battle Royale Emotional Pay-Off that WE DESERVE before Bella ends the Vampiric Arms Race with Her Power and becomes The Queen for All Eternity!",5,Breaking Dawn Part 1 Great...

She ties up a lot of loose ends, and her story makes sense, at least in terms of the world she is trying to portray.  It's apparent she did her homework on vampire mythology, because she introduces the concept of an offspring that is partly living human, partly vampire. This concept is NOT new to this book or this generation! The 1/2 vampire is well noted in literature - it has a generic name - the &#34;damphyre&#34;... or &#34;damphire&#34;.  So she has built upon an existing mythical concept, in a way that is wholy 21st Century in its style.The last movie (well, 2 movies) in the video sequels of the Twilight Saga is an entertaining and interesting movie.  Clearly the book, &#34;Breaking Dawn&#34; is far too large a novel to fit comfortably in a single 2 hour movie! There's enough material in the novel for 3 or 4 movies, if somebody wanted to belabor the point, so to speak.

As a huge fan of the others I was really looking forward to this. There is some graphic stuff at the end so I would not take younger girls to see this. *SPOILERS*The good:The wedding was absolutely beautiful, Charlie was funny/touching (they should be thankful they cast Billie Burke), Kristen Stewart did an awesome job looking like a horrifying walking corpse as the pregnancy progresses (there must be some cgi at work here, she looked like a skeleton). Bella and Edward had some playful moments on the honeymoon, and Edward gets to show more facets of his personality and has some fun for a change (though he some very emotional moments at the end). Leah and Seth were good, (many 'Awwwww' moments from the crowd over BooBoo Stewart). Taylor's been criticized but I think he did a great job, particularly when he comes to dance with Bella at the reception, it was sad. Lautner had some very emotional, touching scenes. He really is the perfect Jacob.  The birth was horrifying, which may fall into good or bad for you.The bad:The imprint. Honestly, they did the best they could with the material. They did kind of a flash forward type of montage where we see wolves, Reneesme, reflections of her older in a wolf's eye. I would have much preferred he went with Leah, Lautner had good chemistry with the actress playing her.The ugly:The two teenaged morons sitting behind me that laughed maniacally through the whole movie and made complete spectacles of themselves. If you hate Twilight, why are you there?Kristen Stewart did a great job portraying the pregnancy, and it was painful to watch her condition deteriorate. Rob and Taylor were both emotional and spot on. I actually got teary eyed at the little montage they play at the end of the movie, showing flashbacks from the others. Depending on your taste, there is not a ton of wolfpack stuff in this one  (I was fine with this because I thought it was a bit repetitive in the novel). It stays true to the book, in some area's really improves on it.

Picture a musical movie, the guy is having a great chat with a girl and then he ruins it by starting to sing...UGH!  That's the basic gist.  The only other area was when they had the wolves in telepathic mode...the voice over should've been LOUDER and the music background MUCH lower. It was hard to understand what they were saying.

1261017,AB34G6VKP28L,B002BWP49C,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[2, 2]","Reviewing a Twilight movie is rather subjective because it is a simple fact that fans are going to love it no matter what and no one else cares. That being said, I liked this film about as much as I liked the book.The time has come for Bella (Kristen Stewart) to give up her humanity and become the vampire wife of Edward (Robert Pattinson). Pre-wedding jitters combined with the absence and noticeable disapproval of her friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) cast a slight shadow over the day, which unfolds just as her future sister in law Alice has planned -- beautifully, even though her father Charlie is a tad disgruntled at her marriage at eighteen, her mother has had a little too much to drink, and her friends suspect she must be pregnant to be tying the knot so young. But it isn't long before the couple is pronounced man and wife and find themselves on a gorgeous island for their honeymoon -- one Bella insists on spending as a human, much to the consternation of anyone who knows. Their passionate night of lovemaking leaves her a little bruised and her husband too intimidated that he might hurt her again to revisit the experience, but Bella manages to convince him to give it another try and the next day wakes up feeling a little bit odd.Within hours, she is convinced that she might be pregnant -- but is such a thing even possible? Apparently it is, and the debate over whether or not to let the ""demon spawn"" live in spite of its seeming intent to kill her from the inside out overshadows all that follows -- which I must admit, is not enough to make a dull book into a four-hour two part film. It's a given that this movie is only for the diehard fans, because for anyone else it will feel melodramatic and slow, without much going for its second half. The first twenty minutes are great (albeit, drug out with internal anxiety over marriage and the wedding night) but once Bella starts bloating like a balloon while simultaneously becoming emaciated, the film follows the same trend that plagued the book -- it abandons all former consistency within the series, all the fun and humor and romance, and turns into a B-grade horror plot. There simply is not enough plot to keep any sort of momentum going and the actors are not solid enough to let it stand purely on emotion alone. Granted, it is not all bad, there are some nice moments here of decent characterization and the acting is much better than when this gang first hit the big screen. There's even a lovely short scene midway through the closing credits with the Italian vampires that are going to present problems in part two. The cinematography is lovely and I particularly enjoyed some of the sweeter moments between Edward and Bella on their Honeymoon.Opinions are going to be varied when it comes to this movie -- if you are a die-hard fan of the book, you will enjoy it, because it is faithful to the source material (though certain compelling things, such as Edward's doubt about his ability to be a parent, are omitted). If, like me, you did not care for the book, there is a very good chance you will have the same feelings about the film.

I thought that this series would've actually grown a brain and a half, and now I'm convinced as all hell that it won't happen.Breaking Dawn Part 1 is another 2 hours of wasted time with virtually no storyline, and still continues to mock and humuliate the Underworld series in every way possible with sparkly vampires and werewolfs that are suppose to be hideous and not gentle. Basically this piece is about teen marriage, sex, and what happens afterwards. The birth scene that this movie shows hardly brings any real power, and (spoiler to those who haven't seen the whole movie) they make the movie fade to the end credits like they did with Avatar.Again, I don't understand how most reviewer's are giving this 5 stars. I wonder what they took before watching this. As far as movies go going out 2011, this movie is not just the biggest embarassment of the year, but the biggest embarassment in the history of mankind. Another thing that had me going WTF is that this feature did a Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows and is split into 2 parts. Honestly, I think they're trying to cash in with this movie in the same way that Harry Potter 7 parts 1 and 2 were done. Despite what they're doing with Breaking Dawn, this movie along with part 2(and this is a guarantee) will still embarass themselves further, and will be no where near as great as Harry Potter 7 was. I can't wait till this series finally finishes itself, so then that way in 20 years from now someone will say team edward or team jacob, and I'll be saying team what.Years from now, the people giving this 5 stars will soon realize how dumb this series is, and will eventually ultimately leave their books and their movies to collect dust.",1,"I Wish I Could Give This 0 out of 5 stars.

I am however, unfortunate in the fact that yet again, I wasted my money. I have slogged through both the books and movies in this series in an attempt to understand the fanbase (many of whom are my friends) and have come away feeling like I have done nothing but waste my time and money. The good news is that because I rented it, it was cheaper for one and I had the option of fastforwarding through vast portions of this yawn fest.First of all, this movie is of course only part 1 of the last book, although I agree with most reviewers in stating that the book really doesn't have enough substance to qualify needing two movies since most of the dialogue in the first portion of the book (before the climax), is internal.About the only good thing I say about this movie is that the backdrops are elaborate and visual eye candy (especially since the rest of the film is boring).The acting is stilted (but I guess I can't expect much when they have crappy books to work with in the first place) and very wooden. This isn't much of a departure from any of the other films.The wedding was obnoxious. The overextended kissing scene was unnecessary. The honeymoon portion (which I know takes up a lot of the first part of the book) was so boring that I ended up fast-forwarding through it (hey, there was no real dialogue, so why do I need to slog through it?).The special effects for the 'wolf pack' are laughable. Are you seriously telling me that with the special effects the movie industry possesses and with the vast amount of money that this stupid series raked up that they couldn't afford DECENT SFX to make the wolves believable? Especially when you consider that the werewolves don't even mimic classical werewolves, but instead look like overgrown wild wolves! I do not think it would have cost much more or been that difficult to make them believable.And oh, the birth scene.. It was graphic in the book, I think less so here, honestly, but still gross. This portion really only serves to scare the crap out of underage girls from ever wanting to have sex. It was like watching a really demented version of ""The Miracle of Life"". I personally think it would have been better (in both film and book) had Bella died and the story continued with her daughter and Edward.And do I even need to go into how entirely wrong and/or disturbing it is that the teenage werewolf ""imprinted"" on a newborn infant? Pedophilia comes to mind.. also, lack of free will on the part of the imprintee.Also, baby Renesmee (stupid name, BTW) = creepy!There is just so much wrong with these films (and the books) that I can't understand how anyone could give any of them more than 2 stars.

Everyone got a little better; they even remembered to thaw out the frozen fish stick that plays the female lead for this film. I'm pretty sure she smiled once for this movie. The films might have outgrown their original low budget director and the mistakes that go along with that since the first film but the screenwriter stayed the same, I guess that's why the films never quite got past the after-school drama/soap opera feel. No need to mention contrived love triangles and shallow story, that's what this is all about. Honestly, this is a great improvement from past films in the series, and it's nice to see almost everyone on screen coming into their own. It no longer has the cardboard cutout feel where you wonder if some of the cast were picked freshly from the mall and stuck behind a movie camera.The soundtrack I'd rate lower than the movie, and I don't think it's worth buying. I can only assume it's aiming for the all grown up feel, but it ends up feeling just plain middle aged, and makes you think maybe you're too young to be watching this movie instead of too old. Nothing memorable about the songs for me; it's the kind of music you have to try to shout over in a restaurant during dinner. Wonder what happened to Desplat, or that nice young fellow with the husky singing voice from the first movie? Won't even bother with the lyrics during the wedding scene, maybe ""warm poison rat"" would be a good description for Kristen, except that she lacks warmth. Yes I know you picked the song for the first movie, but still. At least thumbs up for the continuity.I'll complain about the usual things that get lost in translation from book to movie. The depth and connection you feel with the supporting cast gets supplanted in favor of extraneous fight scenes which the screenwriter added that the book didn't have, as well as lovely scene focusing on, get this, getting off a plan, being in a car, getting out of a car and walking through a very unnatural staged party on a street. Then a boat. Or wait, was that getting on a plane? Doesn't matter. Does it? So long and thanks for all the ambiance.I do look forward to the next installment but I'm really just a glutton for punishment.

1261043,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B002BWP49C,D. A. Reed,"[11, 19]","This movie. What to say about it. After seeing it last night, it's not bad, it's not good. It's just boring. From what I read from one critic, he said he was laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be humorous but other than Bella's dad who got some funny lines and her back being broken, I found nothing funny. The two action scenes near the end would've been nice but they take place at night and the way the action is handled makes it very hard to make out. There are quite a few things that aren't explained such as how can the werewolves all of a sudden ""talk"" in their beast mode if before they never displayed such an ability? How can Edward, who is essentially the living dead, produce sperm in order to get Bella pregnant? And I don't know if this is a plot hole or if this was explained and I missed it but why does Carlisle keep human blood at the house when his group of vampires drink animal blood? Up until now the werewolf/vampire treaty has never been broken so I wouldn't think he'd keep it there for an emergency but like I said I don't know if that't something I missed myself or if that's a plot hole.If you saw the trailer than you pretty much got what happens in the whole film which itself is padded out with repetitive exposition (such as everybody stating how dangerous the baby will be) and several unnecessary flashbacks and dream sequences. In fact, other than ripping off another, more highly successful film/book franchise in splitting their last film in two & more money, I don't see how there's enough material to even support part II that they couldn't have fit in here. Even for Harry Potter, the last movie split in two is a money ploy and I'm pretty sure, fans of Potter and Twilight alike, would've sat through their respective final films as a whole. Not even Return of the King was split in two and it's probably longer than both parts of Deathly Hallows & Breaking Dawn put together.Nothing interesting happens, Bella essentially gets what she wants without learning anything. She hasn't evolved over the course of the previous films, she's remained the same and, other than a few cuts and bites, she hasn't suffered to get where she is now. I'll probably get a lot of flack for this but in Lord of the Rings, Frodo suffers by carrying the fate of the free people of Middle Earth. Harry Potter suffers practically from when he turned one when his parents died and in the subsequent films/books, his godfather, friends and headmaster die for him. What happens to Bella? She falls in love with a vampire while playing on the emotions of the perpetually shirtless werewolf boy. She was almost killed by evil vampires in the first one, got emo and suicidal in the second one after Edward left her and some people died and were turned into an army to kill her in the third but she didn't give a crap about any of those people who disappeared/died even after learning they were turned into vampires in a plot to kill her. In this she gets married, has awkward sex, learns she's pregnant with a horrible CGI baby and gets turned into a vampire through sheer convenience of the plot. The acting from all three leads is pretty bland, even Lautner who I previously said was the only good actor for movies 2 & 3, is rather bad. The background vampires of the first three films get actual stuff to do while the background werewolves are split in two factions. One is out to destroy the abomination that is Bella's child while Jacob (even though he tells them to go away) leads two others for some vague reason but they're hardly featured so I didn't care if they lived or died.So Twilight fans are probably going to love it, regardless of the problems that have existed since film one. If you're not a fan, don't see it. This isn't the worst film that I've seen this year (here's looking at you Green Hornet) but as the first of a two-part finale it doesn't feel like it. Other than this vaguely hinted vampire war, this film doesn't build up to that until an after thought, after credits scene with the Legion of Vampires.

1261055,A3NF0H730HCE0W,B002BWP49C,"Deanna in Cali ""DJ""","[6, 16]","So I have seen all the other Twilight movies and have enjoyed them for exactly what they are: campy, mildly entertaining fantasy romance melodrama.  I have not read the books, but knew what to expect plot-wise from this movie thanks to every magazine, news show, and email homepage that insisted on spilling Twilight ""secrets"" and ruining it for those of us who wanted to - I don't know - SEE what happens in the movie instead of having it's details babbled to us.Anywho . . .The Good:There were a few very honest moments in the movie that I appreciated.  1) Bella being very nervous about her first sexual rendezvous with her new husband.  On many of these teen shows and movies, people just hop into bed like it's no big deal.  How they played this scene out, how tastefully it was done and the fact that they waited 'til marriage was beautiful and honorable. 2) Bella examining herself in the mirror the next morning through new de-virginized eyes. 3)  Flashbacks of Bella's life as she is dying/in the process of being changed into a vampire.  It really gives you the sense that one life is ending and another is beginning; it's a rebirth.I also like that Jacob [Taylor Lautner] got a lot more screen time.  I started off the series being ""Team Edward"" but am now squarely ""Team Jacob"".  He's a waaaaaay better character than Edward: strong, assertive, and, uh . . . actually still alive!  Of course the tanned six-pack doesn't hurt either.  ;)Some of the special effects were good (Bella's back breaking, making her look even thinner when sick and pregnant, her transformation to vamp).I love how smartly they ended the movie (with a split-second shot of Bella's new vampire eyes).  It definitely leaves you wanting to know what happens next and what the new Bella is like:  How strong will she be?  What special abilities will she have?  And most importantly . . . will her acting skills improve?The Bad [better pull up a chair for this part]:Obviously, watching a movie about fictional creatures (vampires & werewolves) requires one to exercise a certain amount of suspended disbelief, but there were elements that were downright ridiculous (100+ year old dead guy impregnating someone), and MANY things that were inconsistent from movie-to-movie.Exhibit A:  When did Edward stop sparkling in the sunlight?  Is this explained in the book? Sure, there were plenty of scenes where the weather was overcast, but how about when Edward and Bella were on a beach in broad daylight?  I thought Edward's skin was supposed to be like diamonds - I guess when he's in a committed relationship he downgrades to cubic zirconium.Exhibit B:  The characters personalities are inconsistent from movie to movie.  In the first two Tilight films, Jasper was played like in immature newbie vampire that was wrestling with his vegetarianess.  Now all the sudden he's mature?  His Southern accent seems to come and go as it pleases too.Exhibit C:  The werewolves seem to have shrunk dramatically.  In the last movie, they appeared to be the size of clydesdale horses.  In Breaking Dawn, they look roughly the size of your neighborhood guard dog.  Not to mention the fact that they have entire conversations [telepathically, of course] in wolf form.  Felt like they'd spliced in a scene from that Zookeeper movie with Kevin James.More badness . . .A VERY out-of-place cheesy wedding reception scene, chock full of sit-comy toasts from Bedwards' [Bella/Edwards] friends and family.  I *almost* appreciate the attempt at adding some levity early on since the audience knows the movie will take a dark turn.  But the result is awkward.Three words:  BELLA'S.  WEDDING.  DRESS.  This was the most truly awful, cheap-looking garment I have ever seen in a film wedding in my life.  I can't believe this was designed by Carolina Herrera.  They must've run out of money after making all those cgi werewolves.  It looked like the spandex leotard from a Halloween costume left in the clearance bin at the dollar store.  Now if stick-figure Kristen Stewart couldn't make it look flattering, I can't imagine what it would like on a woman who actually eats breakfast.  The sad part is, there is a scene where Bella dreams about the wedding before it happens, and the dress in the dream [different dress] is STUNNING.  What happened to *that* dress - was it too fancy for the conscious Bella Swan?And for the worst part . . .Jacob ""imprints"" on Bella's half-vampire baby, Renesmee.  Yes - that's right - an 18-YEAR-OLD dude falls instantly in love . . . with a newborn.  Should I call the police, or will you do it?Despite the cheese factor, the long, slow chunk of the movie that was spent on the honeymoon scenes, and the inconsistencies, will I still see BD Part 2?  Sure.  Why?  Because it's likely to be much better than BD Part 1, which is the weakest of the Twilight films.  And best case scenario, I might finally get an answer as to why a vampire and a werewolf would fight over a girl who has no life goals (other than to die), and constantly appears as though she is experiencing severe menstrual cramps.",3,"Awkward, slow and cheesier than a grande quesadilla [**contains spoliers**]",1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,5083,"['So', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'Twilight',

I saw the first three movies which I borrowed from my local library and really enjoyed them so I decided to fork over the rental fee so as not to have to wait in the library queue for this one.The synopsis and many other reviews here do a great job of explaining the plot in detail so I won't repeat what's already been said and said well by others. I'll just add a little perspective on this movie from someone that is fairly unfamiliar with the story on the whole -This movie had a very different pace than the others; it moves along a little more slowly to let parts of the story develop that I'm sure will be critical to the final installment. I liked the wedding scene where Bella clings on to her dad's arm for dear life until she locks eyes with Edward. That and her teetering on the high heels, asking can't she just go barefoot. The other movies seem to be built more around the ensemble but his movie definitely takes a deeper look at Bella's character, reminding us that this is actually *her* story - she narrates it from the beginning of each movie which is something as a Twilight novice I'd almost forgotten.It will be interesting for me to see how this all plays out.

1261063,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B002BWP49C,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 8]","""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" ends dramatically with Bella (Kristen Stewart) accepting Edward's (Rob Pattinson) engagement ring along with a promise to wax eternally immortal with him before she adds any more visible years to her already painfully virginal and vaguely melancholic eighteen.  As a heroine for the early 2000's, Bella epitomizes the sorrow and confusion of a generation that is well familiar with the breakdown of the traditional family, could Google whatever they think they need to know about just about anything on the Internet and questions their parents' attitudes about being able to do it all, 24-7, without flipping out or being under the care of a permanent life-therapist.  No wonder she opts to join a well appointed, financially secure vampire pride--why contemplate an uncertain future when you can live forever off the spoils of family money, never worry about employment, career or heath care?  Why not pledge to be faithful through sickness and in health when the only illness encountered will be an occasional thirst for Type O or Type A?  Sure, the Volturi could swoop down, either twist some necks or peck their hungry beaks into still-human family members, but hey, that's what being ultimately ""connected"" really means--especially when you have a pack of huge wolves and infinitely strong bloodsuckers as your front and rear guard.  Director Bill Condon understands Bella's choice.  He opens ""Breaking Dawn: Part 1"" with our about-to-become-a-vampiress BFF tottering on wedding-white high-heeled stilettos (she switches them out for tennis shoes to still relate to the klutz-contingency in the audience) to ascertain that Bella is still on pretty shaky ground despite the promise to live happily ever after.""Dawn"" has its moments of action-packed excitement, filmed in the gloaming under the light of a seemingly faraway full moon that barely illuminates snarling computer-generated wolves battling for alpha supremacy or attacking the hungry Cullen clan intent on protecting Bella for what seems like a breach in the famous Northwest wolf-vampire treaty.  However, the main thrust of this installment is not driven by the rivalry between Edward and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) anymore--Edward, after all has won his fair maiden and seems prepared for such a life altering maturity even his randomly skewed hair has settled down to a smoother domestic bliss despite the film's major predicament--this Twilight chapter is re-dedicated to Bella who like a fractured-fairytale Sleeping Beauty finally awakens to her true desire and tells the rest of the 21st century world to virtually blow itself to oblivion.Stewart plays the role comfortably with as much vulnerability and sensitivity as she admirably did in ""Speak.""  The other characters dance to her tune--most notably showing growth is Lautner, who despite moments of un-shirtedness and glimpses of taut muscle seems more believably angry and sarcastic rather than just a beefcake spouting lines of unemotional dialogue.As ""Dawn"" includes sensitively handled marital consummation (Edward demonically destroys the bed) and some pretty horrific vampire-birthing sequences, parents should see the film ahead of time to see if it meets with their standards and those that they wish to teach their pre-teens.  With that in mind, understand that the overall tone of the film wafts with the same melancholy as the other three previous installments--post-honeymoon Bella spends the rest of the film looking gaunt and drained as she stubbornly sticks to her moral guns and her ""baby"" sucks away at her life's blood.The concept of ""imprinting"" is reintroduced to the audience but is not explained as fully as it can be.  Perhaps a flashback of the Sam, Leah and Emily episode would explain Jacob's future experience at the end of the film with more clarity for those who have not read the novels.The return of Carter Burwell's moody music--most notably the lyrical ""Bella's Lullaby"" --underlines Bella's journey from girl to woman especially in the climatic montage, in the psychologically-fueled nightmares prior to the wedding and the dreamy honeymoon sequences replete with moonlight and pillow feathers.Bottom Line?  Director Bill Condon does author Stephanie Meyer's ""Breaking Dawn"" justice in this the first of a one-two punch conclusion of the Twilight Saga films. In this Bella, Jacob and the Cullens ward off the werewolves and biology, quick thinking and genetics does the rest.  ""Dawn"" is just an ordinary episode in the life of anti-heroine Bella Swan Cullen who totters into marriage and motherhood while philosophically eschewing her prolonged 21st century identity angst.  No fans of the series will be disappointed--however this reviewer recommends seeing the first three films first.

Awful; no that doesn't do it justice.  Mind-numbingly boring; well, we're getting closer.  How about the biggest waste of 2-hours plus in my entire lifetime (and I'm a little long in the tooth)?  On the nosey.  I am darn near speechless at just how awful this movie was.  Not much has changed.  Well, Bella and Edward now talk in barely audible whispers; before they just grunted at one another.Eduardo and Bella (Lugosi) get married.  Finally.  He looks just as transluscent as he ever did.  Bella, well, she has more screen presence than a rock...but hasn't mastered a turnip--just yet.  Edward did FINALLY manage to do something with that hair.  As usual, every whisper, every look, every nuance these two characters have, you would think the fate of the earth rests on the outcome.  They float through their wedding vows and after-party. Taylor Lautner (the werewolf) finally shows up, and he and Bella have a b*tch fight about lord knows what.  Hopefully, by the next picture, Lautner's sac will have dropped because he was BY FAR the biggest woman on the screen.  To see him on screen playing this beast who's supposedly in love with one of the main characters is the ONLY touch of comedy through this gawd-awful POS.Come honeymoon time, it seems Eddie and what's-her-name finally knock boots and she's pregnant (and GROWING) in two weeks.  Who knew?  Honeymoon interrupted, they jet back to the northeast so Bella can look like a cadaver (her BEST moments) and the werewolf clan can run around and howl.  A lot.  And a reason for Bella to show she can now be frail and speechless.  A lot.  Also, some of her better moments.I rented the first movies in this series.  I actually watched this one on the movie screen.  What was I thinking?  All I can say is, I hope the Mayan's are right and the world ends before the release of Part 2.

1261076,A2CLCT73B5JV5F,B002BWP49C,Dora A. Smith,"[1, 2]","The reviewers are right; the Twilight Saga series are poor movies.  It's hard to see how even teenagers could enjoy them, and impossible to see how anyone else could.  Alright, the werewolves are cute, but I'm perfectly happy to watch ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"", or Airbuddies, when I want to see cute talking dogs.All four of the series so far drag.  There's little plot, and little action.  Long periods of time are spent in adolescent mooning, and in smooching.  Half of the little tension there is, which isn't much, is concerned parents acting mildly concerned.  Two brief fights and two brief episodes with speeding vehicles occur per movie.  The Jacob vs the Vampire thing is way overplayed. The young male werewolves in human form are corny.  It takes the couple four movies to manage to get married, and at the end of the fourth the baby is barely born - at the cost of the life of the mother, who is brought back as a vampire at the very end of the movie, for those who spent four movies wondering if and when that would happen.Some vampire chiefs in Italy who are mean for no apparent reason, not even because they are vampires, mush in and out of the action pointlessly killing people for no reason at all, not even vampire reasons.  For instance, a young girl was made a vampire to build a big army of vampires to kill the seven member vampire family.  She alternately hides from the fighting and participates reluctantly in the action.  The vampire family try to rescue her.  The vampire chiefs kill her in order to prove that they don't give any second chances.  Neither killing the girl nor the reason given to do so make any sense.  Her death doesn't contribute in any way to the subsequent plot, nor to the general mood, except to the general air of insanity and depression. It doesn't even figure in subsequent thought or discussions about marriage.  Of course, I did begin doing housework because I knew that whatever was going on when I left would be exactly what was still happening when I came back in five or ten minutes - and I wasn't disappointed even once.An entire village in Italy that allegedly drove out the vampires, actually permit the chief vampires to live in a castle in their midst and visit them to become vampire food.  Not a whole lot of this movie makes a whole lot of sense.Throughout the movie we hear those much vaunted songs that are sold on those much vaunted sound tracks; they have no melody and no rhythm, and would appeal to only to a 16 year old enjoying a long bout of mooning depression.After learning that Indians are werewolves defending their tribal territory from vampires, and seeing the seemingly endless chain of new vampires being created everytime one of them feeds, which we're given to believe they do constantly, it makes no logical sense that there are still humans on the planet.  But not alot about this movie makes any logical sense.The entire movies couldn't appeal to anyone but mooning 16 year olds with depression, and wouldn't appeal to most of them.Honest to God, having spent three evenings and part of a Sunday watching them, I am now depressed.I definitely won't be running to the movie theaters to watch ""Endless Depression"" Part two!Parents whose teens go wild about this movie might want to have their mental health professionally evaluated.",2,"Little action, much mooning, tragic and senseless outcome",1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,3321,"['reviewers', 'are', 'right', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'series', 'are', 'poor', 'movies', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'even', 'teenagers', 'could', 'enjoy', 'impossible', 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'Alright', 'werewolves', 'are', 'cute', ""'m"", 'perfectly', 'happy', 'watch', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Chihuahua', 'Airbuddies', 'when', 'want', 'see', 'cute', 'talking', 'dogs.All', 'four', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'drag', 'little', 'plot', 'little', 'action', 'Long', 'periods', 'time', 'are', 'spent', 'adolescent', 'mooning', 'smooching', 'Half', 'little', 'tension', ""n't"", 'much', 'concerned', 'parents', 'acting', 'mildly', 'concerned', 'Two', 'brief', 'fights', 'two', 'brief', 'episodes', 'speeding', 'vehicles', 'occur', 'movie', 'Jacob', 'vs', 'Vampire', 'thing', 'way', 'overplayed', 'young', 'male', 'werewolves', 'human', 'form', 'are', 'corny', 'couple', 'four', 'movies', 'manage', 'get', 'married', 'end', 'fourth', 'baby', 'barely', 'born', 'cost', 'life', 'mother', 'who', 'brought', 'back', 'vampire', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'who', 'spent', 'four', 'movies', 'wondering', 'when', 'would', 'happen.Some', 'vampire', 'chiefs', 'Italy', 'who', 'are', 'mean', 'apparent', 'reason', 'not', 'even', 'are', 'vampires', 'mush', 'action', 'pointlessly', 'killing', 'people', 'reason', 'not', 'even', 'vampire', 'reasons', 'instance', 'young', 'girl', 'was', 'made', 'vampire', 'build', 'big', 'army', 'vampires', 'kill', 'seven', 'member', 'vampire', 'family', 'alternately', 'fighting', 'reluctantly', 'action', 'vampire', 'family', 'try', 'rescue', 'vampire', 'chiefs', 'kill', 'order', 'prove', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'second', 'chances', 'killing', 'girl', 'reason', 'given', 'do', 'so', 'make', 'sense', 'death', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'way', 'subsequent', 'plot', 'general', 'mood', 'general', 'air', 'insanity', 'depression', ""n't"", 'even', 'figure', 'subsequent', 'thought', 'discussions', 'marriage', 'course', 'did', 'begin', 'doing', 'housework', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'when', 'left', 'would', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'still', 'happening', 'when', 'came', 'back', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'even', 'once.An', 'entire', 'village', 'Italy', 'allegedly', 'drove', 'out', 'vampires', 'actually', 'permit', 'chief', 'vampires', 'live', 'castle', 'midst', 'visit', 'become', 'vampire', 'food', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'sense.Throughout', 'movie', 'hear', 'much', 'vaunted', 'songs', 'are', 'sold', 'much', 'vaunted', 'sound', 'tracks', 'have', 'melody', 'rhythm', 'would', 'appeal', 'only', '16', 'year', 'old', 'enjoying', 'long', 'bout', 'mooning', 'depression.After', 'learning', 'Indians', 'are', 'werewolves', 'defending', 'tribal', 'territory', 'vampires', 'seeing', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'chain', 'new', 'vampires', 'being', 'created', 'everytime', 'one', 'feeds', ""'re"", 'given', 'believe', 'do', 'constantly', 'logical', 'sense', 'are', 'still', 'humans', 'planet', 'not', 'alot', 'movie', 'logical', 'sense.The', 'entire', 'movies', 'could', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'anyone', 'mooning', '16', 'year', 'olds', 'depression', 'would', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'most', 'them.Honest', 'God', 'having', 'spent', 'three', 'evenings', 'part', 'Sunday', 'watching', 'am', 'now', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'running', 'movie', 'theaters', 'watch', 'Endless', 'Depression', 'Part', 'two', 'Parents', 'teens', 'go', 'wild', 'movie', 'might', 'want', 'have', 'mental', 'health', 'professionally', 'evaluated']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

1261084,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B002BWP49C,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[22, 56]","Ever since I read the epic disaster that was ""Breaking Dawn,"" I have been eagerly anticipating this movie. It was one of the vilest, silliest, grossest books I've ever read in my life, and I assumed that the movie would at least be funny. I mean, there's a scene where Edward chews open Bella's uterus!Well, ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I"" managed to disappoint me. While there are some jaw-droppingly stupid moments, most of the movie is simply droningly dull -- there's more padding than actual story here, riddled with painfully awkward acting, monotonous sex scenes, and lots of important topics (like abortion) that the writers aren't NEARLY smart enough to address.Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are finally getting married... and we get to see every single step of it. Everything. We see hairstyling, shoes, invitations, furniture arrangement, awkward toasts and the newlyweds making out at the altar (classy!). Oh, and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) freaks out when he discovers that Bella plans to actually (gasp!) have sex with Edward on their honeymoon.So they finally have melodramatic sex... only for Bella to get lightly bruised, which upsets Edward so much that he refuses to have sex with Bella again... for about a day.But then, Bella unexpectedly gets pregnant (wow, sex leads to pregnancy! WHAT A TWIST!). Excepting Rosalie, the Cullens all want her to abort the baby, but Bella refuses to do so even though it's killing her. This threatens to spark off another battle between the werewolves and vampires, because Bella is the center of the universe.The worst thing about this dreadful movie is that they broke the ludicrous ""Breaking Dawn"" story into two separate movies. This works when you have an epic story (""The Hobbit"") or a plot-heavy one (""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows""). But for a tween-porn romance about how special Bella is for having a functioning uterus, it's the kiss of death.So to fill out all the space NOT occupied by plot or characterization, the movie is crammed with padding. Lots of padding. Endless padding. We're forced to watch Bella shaving her legs, lounging around the house, and listening to hideously unfunny wedding toasts (except for Charlie's). Even the SEX feels like it has been padded -- I spent most of the PG-13 sex scenes wondering if Bella would ever change expression during sex (and no, she didn't).But the movie REALLY jumps the rails when Bella gets knocked up with her demonspawn. Suddenly we're assaulted with hellish birth scenes, sexual fantasies about a newborn baby, and ghastly CGI wolves. And whenever those CGI wolves are onscreen, the mood jumps from ""stoned"" to ""hilariously hammy"" (""I AM THE GRANDSON OF THE CHIEF!"").Oh yes, and there are massive plot holes that render most of the plot pointless. For instance, the Cullens whine at Bella to have an abortion or she'll die. At that point, she appears to be at least 8 months along. WHY DOESN'T CARLISLE GIVE HER A C-SECTION?The acting is pretty much what you would expect. Kristen Stewart seems grossed out by even pretending to have sex with a man, and Bella is her usual graceless, mumbly, whiny, mouth-breathing self. She spends most of the movie either LITERALLY begging Edward for sex or cuddling up next to Jacob.And Edward shows just how abusive and obnoxious he can be, INFORMING Bella that she's going to get an abortion and emotionally blackmailing her when she won't.  As for Jacob... well, kiss any likable qualities in this character goodbye. After ranting about the evils of imprinting, he becomes a brainwashed pedophile engaged to a baby. And everyone is okay with this.I at least expected ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I"" to be horrible in a MST3K way, but sadly it just ends up a slow, dull grind riddled with gaping plot holes.

1261087,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002BWP49C,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","TWILIGHT: BREAKING DAWN (2011, 117 minutes a full 6 of which are credits) may be credited highly for one vital 'gift': no matter how insipid, dumb or vacuous, it has kept me watching (to have myself a good laugh if nothing else). Frankly I thought all this story up to this point was covered in the last novel - but then what do I know of such things. The real question is, why blow a franchise like this, regardless of how unworthy it is as cinema?Here, Bella (hope I spelled that right!!) and Edward set their absolute wedding date, get married and honeymoon near Rio de Janeiro. There: it's about half the film right there. How interesting. Aside from some dopey honeymoon whoopie and attendant humor, which you might expect between a vampire and a mortal, there's nothing happening.That is, until the girl realizes she's pregnant. This is impossible!! A mortal conceived a miraculous vampire baby by a vampire father! Whose eyes will it have? What sort of nighttime feeding schedule will it need? Will its mother survive? Of course none of that is any dumber than the rest of this silly series, but I know I wondered all that to myself. I also thought ultimately, Jacob might have to be turned into a vampire (well, maybe not but in this film he defects to their side for Bella's sake). I wondered what names they'd give the baby (that was spelled out clearly when the time came, so crap, I guess ""Mitt if it's a boy or Condolezza if it's a girl"" is down the tubes).It was interesting to me to see what would occur with Jacob once he defected from his wolf pack, or, um, tribe or whatever it is. Yes, I know how insulting all that is to Native Americans, but this is pretty dumb so as not to be taken seriously. That may be the most interesting thing presented here. And I just read a hilarious review that describes Jacob as having suddenly turned ""pedophile"" for a girl not yet born - see, THAT kind of thing is what happens when you have films that are this stupid.Finally, the Vulturi make an appearance after the major end credits, because we can't have them being left out, and good old Michael Sheen is going to start a hunt of his own. The Cullens now have something he wants: a bouncy baby vampire girl. Was it a girl? I really could not tell. I did notice Dakota Fanning and her gay pals are on vacation and Sheen stepped back in after having gone mysteriously missing.Well, it's the usual nonsense, the pained, aching frowns emanating from both Bella and Edward to match the stormiest of centuries, the whiny music-video style (a bit toned down in this entry), and I have to say they are learning to improve the dialogue - but definitely not the acting. Miss K. Stewart still looks like a hung-over dimwitted lesbian and nothing in Hollywood will ever help, poor thing. Robert still can't act and about Mr. Taylor L. it is best to remain silent. Everyone else is a cardboard cutout here.All of which I find a dreadful waste. Think about it: a vampire! One could become an expert in EVERY field of learning. One could be an inventor extraordinaire and live to see one's inventions change the world. One could cure diseases, learn to compose music, the possibilities are as infinite as a vampire's existence. Yet here we have one physician (apparently he already was one when he became a vampire) surrounded by a gaggle of boneheads.It is this set of ideas that really angers me about this sort of tripe.

To forgive for no...","[3, 4]","First, I still like the Twilight movie franchise and have found it to be unique, powerful and romantic.  So far, though, Breaking Dawn Part 1 is my least favorite and that is because it appears rushed.  Instead of trying to drag out the franchise for dollar$ they probably should have combined Breaking Dawn Parts 1 & 2 into a 2.5 or 3 hr film.  While it may have been a bit long, as much as people love this series they would have made their way to the theatre through a hurricane no matter the personal cost to their lives and sat through a 3 hour movie.  I'm disappointed that the producers of Twilight decided to drag out the last two parts to the series (to capitalize on profit, I'm sure).As for content, it's a bit ""lite"" which is really saying something since all of the Twilight movies can be described that way by degrees - lol!  The most powerful part of the movie was definitely the birth of Renesmee (horrible choice for a name in a movie script) which was pretty grim and made me wince several times.  Other than that though, the wolf pow-wow where they speak to each other telepathically was kind of silly, the lead up to the wedding and the wedding itself was too fast, the dialog seemed much lighter than in the previous films, and I didn't walk away feeling quite as emotionally full as I had after viewing Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse.  Also, not sure what all the hype was about but the sex scene between Bella and Edward was really mild... nothing overtly graphic or extreme (maybe they altered and cut part of the scene?).Overall, I liked Breaking Dawn Part 1, but found it not to be in the full spirit of the first 3 movies.

1261134,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B002BWP49C,Jason,"[14, 25]","Twilight, Breaking Dawn, Part 1 continues the tale of Bella (Kristen Stewart), a young girl with a truly agonizing life.  Facial expressions nearly non-existent, she has struggled through her teen life in Forks, WA with Bell's Palsy and has been unable to convey her emotions.  Particularly her love.  This makes life especially difficult because she finally made the choice between necrophilia and bestiality.  She decided to marry Edward (Robert Pattinson) in Eclipse, dropping Jacob (Taylor Lautner) like a bad habit, and this is where BD begins.Until the wedding -beautiful by the way - it was unclear whether or not Bella also had Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  Perhaps Bella doesn't, but Kristen Stewart portrays the character that way.  It became very apparent during her walk up the aisle.  Personally, I think Stewart was going for nervousness, but it definitely came across as a stomach-twisting case of Montezuma's Revenge.  The undeniably best portion of Stewart's performance was when she was a prostrate corpse just before change-over.  Although there was a glimmer of hope when she had a gruesome spinal injury that made me think she might possibly channel the only successful acting performance of her career fromCake Eaters.  Meanwhile, Pattinson continues to evolve as an actor, appearing to show true anguish, pleasure, and contentment throughout various plot arcs.  Lautner does little more than fulfill his contractual shirt-removal obligation once or twice.Despite the subject matter, the drama in BD is relatively toothless.  Bella gets pregnant on the Honeymoon - a sequence that was rumored for months to be steamy but instead is ridiculous - and the baby grows like Robin Williams inJack.  Naturally the undead baby in her womb presents a certain ""Superman can't get a human woman pregnant""-dilemma, and complications arise.  As Bella battles for her life, the vampires and werewolves position for a showdown over the bundle of joy/abomination.After such an improvement inEclipse, it's shocking so much gets worse.  The directing change from David Slade to Bill Condon was a horrendous choice.  Where Slade succeeded, Condon utterly fails.  Condon is too singularly focused, and leaves nearly everything else out.  The subplots for other characters?  Gone.  The tightly filmed battles between vampires and werewolves?  Gone.  The film regresses to the ubiquitous staring contests.  And don't even get me going on the hokey, molecular-level view of what's going on when Bella transforms from dead-acting to dead.  When one of the two characters carrying a film literally breaks their back in the film, perhaps it's analogous to why someone incapable of carrying a film shouldn't be asked to do so.Ultimately this was a tribute to the teenage girls who have made Stephanie Meyer rich.  The breakdown is A) Love scenes, B) Pregnant Bella turning so skeletal she almost dies, C) An animalistic birth that almost kills the mother.  Had I known I would have watchedBasic Instinct,The MachinistandAlien.  The average movie fan will not like this film; the Twilight fanatics will continue to shriek like little girls.",2,"If Eclipse was a positive move forward, Breaking Dawn slams the car in reverse",1323907200,"12 15, 2011",2011,3131,"['Twilight', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', '1', 'tale', 'Bella', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'young', 'girl', 'truly', 'agonizing', 'life', 'Facial', 'expressions', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'struggled', 'teen', 'life', 'Forks', 'WA', 'Bell', 'Palsy', 'been', 'unable', 'convey', 'emotions', 'Particularly', 'love', 'life', 'especially', 'difficult', 'finally', 'made', 'choice', 'necrophilia', 'bestiality', 'decided', 'marry', 'Edward', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Eclipse', 'dropping', 'Jacob', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'bad', 'habit', 'where', 'BD', 'wedding', '-beautiful', 'way', 'was', 'unclear', 'not', 'Bella', 'also', 'had', 'Irritable', 'Bowel', 'Syndrome', 'Perhaps', 'Bella', ""n't"", 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'character', 'way', 'became', 'very', 'apparent', 'walk', 'aisle', 'Personally', 'think', 'Stewart', 'was', 'going', 'nervousness', 'definitely', 'came', 'stomach-twisting', 'case', 'Montezuma', 'Revenge', 'undeniably', 'best', 'portion', 'Stewart', 'performance', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'prostrate', 'corpse', 'just', 'change-over', 'was', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'when', 'had', 'gruesome', 'spinal', 'injury', 'made', 'think', 'might', 'possibly', 'channel', 'only', 'successful', 'acting', 'performance', 'career', 'fromCake', 'Eaters', 'Meanwhile', 'Pattinson', 'evolve', 'actor', 'appearing', 'show', 'true', 'anguish', 'pleasure', 'contentment', 'various', 'plot', 'arcs', 'Lautner', 'little', 'more', 'fulfill', 'contractual', 'shirt-removal', 'obligation', 'once', 'twice.Despite', 'subject', 'matter', 'drama', 'BD', 'relatively', 'toothless', 'Bella', 'pregnant', 'Honeymoon', 'sequence', 'was', 'rumored', 'months', 'be', 'steamy', 'instead', 'ridiculous', 'baby', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'inJack', 'Naturally', 'undead', 'baby', 'womb', 'certain', 'Superman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'human', 'woman', 'pregnant', '-dilemma', 'complications', 'arise', 'Bella', 'life', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'position', 'showdown', 'bundle', 'joy/abomination.After', 'such', 'improvement', 'inEclipse', 'shocking', 'so', 'much', 'worse', 'directing', 'change', 'David', 'Slade', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'was', 'horrendous', 'choice', 'Where', 'Slade', 'succeeded', 'Condon', 'utterly', 'Condon', 'too', 'singularly', 'focused', 'nearly', 'everything', 'else', 'out', 'subplots', 'other', 'characters', 'Gone', 'tightly', 'filmed', 'battles', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'Gone', 'film', 'ubiquitous', 'staring', 'contests', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'going', 'hokey', 'molecular-level', 'view', 'what', 'going', 'when', 'Bella', 'dead-acting', 'dead', 'When', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'carrying', 'film', 'literally', 'back', 'film', 'perhaps', 'analogous', 'why', 'someone', 'incapable', 'carrying', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'asked', 'do', 'so.Ultimately', 'was', 'tribute', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'rich', 'breakdown', 'Love', 'scenes', 'B', 'Pregnant', 'Bella', 'turning', 'so', 'skeletal', 'almost', 'dies', 'C', 'animalistic', 'birth', 'almost', 'mother', 'Had', 'known', 'would', 'have', 'watchedBasic', 'Instinct', 'MachinistandAlien', 'average', 'movie', 'fan', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'Twilight', 'fanatics', 'will', 'continue', 'shriek', 'little', 'girls']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

1261138,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B002BWP49C,Jean-ren Leroux,"[29, 44]","This comment is mostly for some ""real"" men out there.Here, in Montreal (Qu&eacute;bec, Canada), you can't say that you like ""Breaking Dawn"" if you're a ""real"" man. It's not cool. It's not manly. People will think of you as weak or ""girlie"". In general, if you're a ""real"" man, it's a good thing to say that you went because your girlfriend or your wife forced you. Is it the same where you are? Anyhow, I liked it immensely. And I don't consider myself a ""weak"" man nor do I think that I'm more in touch with my feminine side than any other regular Joe. My point is: I doubt seriously anyone who destroys this movie on the simple basis that it's a ""chick flick"".If you didn't like it because of its narrative structure or whatever technicality, it's one thing. I can respect that. This film, like the others, isn't an intellectual movie made to re-invent cinema. ""Breaking Dawn"" employs clich&eacute;s after clich&eacute;s and I would even describe it as ""cheesy""... but in a good way. It is honest with what it is trying to achieve. The characters are consistent and true to themselves. The movie starts and we're right there in the action. We don't waste any time with any sort of intro. The scenes flow very well and the rhythm is always good.  The actors (especially Kirsten Stewart) are better and better. I didn't think the fourth book would make a great movie, let alone a two-part movie but I stand corrected. This first part was awesome. All to the honor of the director. I was sad that it was over. The book is well respected. And the ending is just as great as the one in ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part One"". You have to remain seated through the end credits though cause there is one more scene later on that will set up the next installment. During the projection, you will even spot Stephanie Meyer, the author of the novels, in one of the scenes. She's smiling directly at us (we're seeing her through Bella's point of view) and it's touching cause this whole thing is ""her baby"".No really, this film as a lot going for it. If you dismiss it on the simple fact that you're a ""real"" man and that the characters talk too much about their feelings, well maybe you should re-evaluate your own relationship with your tender-half. Maybe you're jealous of the love Bella and Edward have for each other? Maybe you feel like you're not showing enough affection the way Edward or Bella do?Go see it. Let your manly armor down for two hours. After that, if you have constructive criticism, then God bless you.

I of course own all three as I own every movie based on any book I love but unlike it's Predecessors this one hits it hard and by that I mean really really good, I couldn't express how good without ruining anything for those who have not seen it or read the books but it's definitely something to sink your teeth into if you know what I mean ;)!I had high hopes for this just because they were breaking it into two parts which was something I wish all of them could have done but if they were to choose one title to do two parts I'm really glad they chose this one.. This story would have been impossible to do in one film without hacking the book into pieces while in the process so I will love to put my stamp on this with a 5 star review! Actually I like the other movies somewhat better just because of the effort on part one of this (I really thought they were gonna do a hack job so strongly that I almost didn't buy it)..You get love, sex, intrigue, betrayal and some really cool action, this is a milestone in the twilight series so much so that I actually am craving more and I mean NOW! Finally people have grown up, kids turn into adults and leave the high school child drama behind them while stepping into a whole new realm where lines will be drawn, bonds broken and all those childish walls will come crashing down.. For those of you that have loved these movies there is no reason why this would not become an instant favorite sure to be a classic in movies of this genre.. With this addition to the twilight series in movie form it has become an instant favorite to me and I will proudly put it right next to Interview with the Vampire, now that is saying something to me..For my fellow twilight book hounds then I will say that with being split into two parts it is able to build the story more closely to the book than any of the previous attempts, I won't say that they didn't leave anything out..Of course with any book to movie that is impossible but needless to say without spoiling anything they do shave off quite a lot on the jacob melodramatic side story which doesn't bother me because if they had to leave anything out I would rather them leave that out than to take away other more important aspects of the story...Now since they did the two part split, when you get to that all important part we were craving for and dieing to find out (TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS NEXT) :) ....Now they have a whole two more hours to really bare down on the really juicy stuff!!!!!Cheers Cheers and more Cheers for this ( I can't believe I'm saying it, Finally!)Lastly, to those concerned or worried still thinking hmmm should I get it? Is it really that good? Well I will say this, this film is not without it's slower parts to it but trust me they need it to build in to what is coming next and since they did this one the way it is I can tell you with sure certainty that they will NOT disappoint any of us in bringing probably the best conclusion to a series that I can ever remember( If they stick to what they did here)Bottom line pure wicked joy!!!",5,Wicked good!

1261152,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B002BWP49C,JLind555,"[4, 9]","What ""Breaking Dawn"" adds up to is a watered-down version of a godawful book.  It doesn't have the audacity to be as godawful as the book.  It doesn't do much of anything.  It's just ""meh"".The wedding scene drags out interminably, to the point where you wished they had climbed out the window and eloped.  The South American scenery is beautiful but the honeymoon scenes don't come close to being interesting.  About the only thing remotely interesting is Bella's nightmarish pregnancy; her post-delivery transformation is a big yawn.Characters... what characters?  After planning the wedding, perky little Alice has nothing to do the rest of the movie.  Emmett's and Jasper's parts have shrunk to the point that if weren't in the film nobody would miss them.  I liked Seth in the book but he's not developed enough in the movie.  And Leah, who was a feisty character in ""Eclipse"", is just plain pathetic in this movie.  Rosalie is semi-convincing as doting auntie, and Taylor Lautner gives a pretty good performance as Jacob, although his imprinting on a newborn had me retching.  Actually, Kristen Stewart gives the best performance in the film; we can almost feel her pain as whatever is growing inside her is eating her up from the inside out.  Billy Burke gives his usual understated, standout performance as Bella's dad.  And Robert Pattinson, as usual in this series, just looks gorgeous without making much effort at acting.The movie tries to improve on the book in spots and fails abysmally.  There's an unintentionally hilarious scene where all the wolves have a big pow-wow in dubbed English.  One almost wishes they would bark and howl with subtitles translating what they were howling about but that might have been even funnier.  And the big transformation scene, which is the linchpin of the book, looks like a poor imitation of some scenes out of ""Fantastic Voyage"".  But since the book had Bella lying like an inert lump and never twitching an eyelash while she was being burned alive internally, I guess all the movie could do was show her lying like an inert lump.  It just isn't very interesting to watch.So what we have to wait for in Part 2 is Bella being a very well-bred newborn, Jacob imprinting further on Renesmee, and the climactic battle scene with the Volturi in which everybody stands around yacking and then turn around and go home.

While general consensus may differ from this opinion, Breaking Dawn: Part 1 is the closest these films have ever come to being ""good."" Perhaps I went in with such low expectations that the film became better as a result of my own bias. Alas, no, I contribute this ""success"" to Academy Award winning director Bill Condon (in the interest of fairness, his Oscar win came for screenwriting) taking the reins and managing to do the unthinkable; elevate the material and those whose job it is to convey the material. This is certainly the best looking, most well-directed, and well-acted entry thus far. That's not to say the acting has actually teetered into the realm of the convincing or that the film succeeds as a good piece of cinema, but at least it's compelling more often than unintentionally hilarious.With Summit Films taking a page from Warner Bros. treatment of the final Harry Potter movie, this film represents 50% of the last hurrah of the Twilight Saga and it enters territory previously unexplored in the past three films. In a typical review I would warn you that spoilers may follow, but any information I'm about to divulge about the plot seems to be common knowledge. I have never read the books or actively tried to have the story spoiled for me, but I also don't live under a rock and knew many plot details beforehand. Breaking Dawn opens with characters receiving invitations to the wedding of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). The first person we see receiving an invitation is Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who storms out of his house upon hearing the news and before you know it...There goes the shirt. Yes, the long awaited human/vampire union has arrived and goes off mostly without a hitch. Minutes later, Edward and Bella have arrived on a private island in Brazil for their honeymoon. Here, the abstinence metaphor of the story is disregarded in favor of providing audiences with the most long-awaited onscreen deflowering in years. I warn you not to be too intrigued by this prospect as the ""sex scene"" is a total cop out. When the core audience that has made millionaires of many studio executives is under the age of seventeen, what can be shown is significantly restricted. In Breaking Dawn, the moment of truth is a swift cut to the next day where the room is in shambles and Bella is covered in bruises. I almost felt bad for the Twilight fans. They waited so long for...this?Of course, the plot really begins when Bella discovers that she's pregnant with Edward's vampiric spawn and the fetus is growing at an accelerated rate that prompts them to rush back to Forks, Washington to be watched over by the Cullen Clan. Turns out that no one was aware a human could be impregnated by a vampire and that Bella's pregnancy will likely result in her death. Not satisfied with one dramatic conflict, Bella's pregnancy ends the peace treaty between vampires and werewolves making it Jacob's responsibility to dissent from his pack and help protect Bella.After three years and three films of heavy petting, you get marriage, sex, and pregnancy all within an hour. Having previously been an allegory for abstinence, Twilight now succeeds at being an allegory for how quickly a young girl can ruin her life. The bizarre plot of Breaking Dawn works in its favor, making it more mature and compelling than its predecessors although its flaws simply cannot be overlooked. While the acting has improved exponentially, the dialogue has not and the visual effects are still piss poor. After three films, Pattinson has grown as an actor and no longer looking nauseated in every scene, actually manages to give Edward some depth of character. Lautner's boyishness hinders his performance in that it makes it hard to accept him as a masculine romantic lead. His determination and obsession with Bella make you want to reassure him ""everything's going to be OK, scamp"" rather than scream ""yeah, bro!"" Stewart, a usually capable actress in non-Twilight material, makes Bella more tolerable than ever but fails to make some of the film's most important scenes convincing. During the wedding scene, Bella doesn't look excited or nervous or jittery. She looks sick with a chronic stomachache. Meanwhile, Bella's pregnant look seems to be modeled after the people on ""Meth Project"" billboards. I don't need Twilight fans to explain the logistics behind her pregnancy; I'm aware that it's responsible for making her look that way. Pregnant belly aside, Bella seems to be in the throes of crystal meth addiction rather than suffering through a vampire pregnancy. The most embarrassing piece of acting comes from the pack of werewolves having a meeting in their werewolf form. The poorly-rendered CGI-wolves snarling at each other while the laughable voice performances sound lazily frustrated make this scene unintentionally humorous. Ironically, one of the most consistent aspects of all four films is Billy Burke as Charlie Swan. As in the previous entries, Burke is effortless and charming, continuing his trek through these movies unscathed. He is so natural and likable amidst the chaos that it makes his performance seem Oscar-worthy. His speech at the wedding actually made me smile; one of the few times I've ever smiled during these films for the right reasons.Despite reportedly being a real-life couple, there remains a noticeable lack of chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson. Since this is where Bella officially, with no regrets, chooses Edward over Jacob I wonder why Stewart and Lautner have more chemistry and emotional connection. One of the most poignant moments of the whole saga occurs in a scene between Bella and Jacob after the wedding. Is this a reflection of the acting or is this how the story was written? The latter would make sense. I've given up trying to criticize the particulars of the story. I have many questions, beginning with why the Cullen Clan puts up with the immature girl with no personality, but my biggest question is about the logistics behind the sparkling. I don't know it works, but I know there are several scenes depicting Edward in broad daylight...And he's not sparkling. Did the filmmakers forget? Or am I just ignorant to the ways of the sparkle?I have not read the books, but I now feel comfortable placing any blame on my qualms with the storytelling and/or dialogue on Meyer rather than screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg. I think Rosenberg does the best she can with the little freedom she has to tamper with the original text. I put bias aside watching these films, but I'll admit that I have no faith in the quality or intelligence of the writing. There's a moment of Edward and Bella playing chess, Bella making her game-ending move and exclaiming ""I win!"" The possibility that this wasn't the line she was passively given and that the writer had no idea what ""checkmate"" was did occur to me.It's common knowledge that Meyer is Mormon, but nothing has made that more apparent than Breaking Dawn. When Bella is pregnant, the story becomes, with no subtlety, an allegory for the evils of abortion. The most uninformed, absent-minded viewer would be able to pick up on this. Edward alludes to abortion by saying they need to ""get that thing out"" and a character later scolds another for saying `fetus' with ""Say it! It's a baby."" It's hard to ignore the anti-choice stance made when Bella, knowing her pregnancy will likely kill her, decides to go through with it. I don't believe the quality of a film is affected by it taking a stance on a controversial issue, whether that stance is parallel to my own or not, I just wish they could have been a little more subtle with their handling of this issue. I'm aware the Twilight Saga has never been much for subtlety, you've heard the dialogue, but the message is a little too heavy-handed and draws more attention to itself than necessary.Breaking Dawn is very well shot, particularly in regards to the locale of the honeymoon, and it boasts a professional feel that the series lacked previously. Condon has not changed water into wine but his proficiency makes the long-awaited birth scene into a surprisingly harrowing moment, even without the restrictions considered. It's a well-edited and assembled scene that is certainly one of the most impressive in the movie. The execution of the final scene is actually effective too, an achievement I fully attribute to Condon as it's not what's being shown but how it's being shown that ultimately matters. Even with these moments of success, his handling of the imprinting scene is a low point. I don't know who could have handled this in a convincingly serious manner, but it plays like a bad joke and could possibly be the most embarrassing moment of Condon's career, as well as Lautner's.Each Twilight film has been progressively better than the previous entry, or perhaps less terrible. Breaking Dawn skates close to the edge of being an acceptable movie, with the writing being what ultimately holds it back. Even with a knowledgeable director, compelling scenes, and actors who finally seem to care, it just can't rise above the foundation of Meyer's putrid writing. I admit that, despite how many times I rolled my eyes, I almost liked Breaking Dawn. For the first time with this series, I was entertained enough to say ""hey, that was acceptable for the emotionally stagnant melodrama it is."" I did not think it was almost a good film, I did not almost understand its cultural impact, nor did I almost embrace the characters or their plight. With Eclipse, the Twilight Saga became more tolerable by morphing into an action film. Breaking Dawn becomes more tolerable by (almost) morphing into a horror film. I stand by my assertion that no one years from now will look back on these films fondly and I believe that the popularity of this series will completely die out with the release of the final movie next year. I found Breaking Dawn compelling enough at times and it entertained me, but it's still a mediocre and poorly written mess.

After finally receiving my Blu-Ray version from Amazon (I'm not going to forget my disappointment when they didn't pre-ship for a LONG time), I decided a review was overdue.I have loved all of the Twilight movies, despite the criticism they have received.  I think that Breaking Dawn: Part 1 was the best one so far, although there is a special place in my heart for the first movie.  Seeing the characters I loved so much come to life for the first time was so special.  I'll never forget how I felt the first time I saw Rob Pattinson as Edward!I thought that this movie could have felt slow, but the director managed to keep it exciting and full of action (even though some of that action was not found in the original story, grrr).  I was so happy that there was not part of the movie narrated from Jacob's perspective, like there is in the book.  I think it would have really slowed the movie down and changed the tone of it completely.My favorite part of the movie was the wedding: Bella and Edward have been heading towards that wedding since Edward walked into the cafeteria in Twilight.  Didn't Bella look so beautiful?  Although I did enjoy the honeymoon too...I loved the special effects, especially the way Bella looked while pregnant.  She was scary!  And I loved the way they handled her transformation.  She looked like Snow White: so beautiful!  But one question---has Kristen Stewart always been this tiny?  She is so, so small.  I could not believe how thin she looked in her wedding dress and in her swimsuit on the honeymoon.Overall, I loved Breaking Dawn: Part 1.

1261208,A1H3T42XDD12A5,B002BWP49C,Lenoir,"[6, 10]","....but it's a long two hours before they do.Breaking Dawn, the book, was unequivocally the worst piece of ""literature"" I've read, and I've read thousands of books in my life. So I wasn't going to bother seeing the movie, as I'd gotten the impression it followed the book pretty closely. But I was curious to see what the screenwriters (most of whom are probably still in rehab after being strapped with trying to adapt this piece of swill) could have done with it. Plus, I got a free rental. As it turns out, no magical healing powers of rewriting for screen could mend this debacle of fiction. Though I give the writers credit for at least trying, if only, as it appears, half-heartedly. For instance, they did try to put a Band-Aid on the glaring inconsistency Meyer dragged into the book about vampires being able to have children. (Meyer, hack writer she turned out to be, broke the Golden Rule of Writing by not sticking to the parameters she'd established within her own fiction.) But this Band-Aid was merely a vague reference by Carlisle, I believe, as to it being rare but having happened before, and Edward using a Yahoo search engine. Hey! Job done! I'm convinced, aren't you? And nice cross-product promotion while we're at it.They also tried - realizing the obnoxious and incomprehensible use of a name like Renesmee (pardon if I screwed up the spelling there, but does it even matter?) - to make a funny scene of smirking and dubiousness by some of the characters when the name was introduced. Again, the attempt was half-hearted, and the scene fell flat. I mean, really, what COULD they do with that? Nice try guys. Oh, but the ""love scene"" was good comic relief at least. When Edward broke the bed frame in the heat of..... what was that? Passion? I burst out laughing and couldn't stop! That WAS supposed to be funny, right?Sadly, the remainder of the movie stuck all too faithfully to the book. The chemistry between Bella and Edward was truly dead. The characters behaved vaguely and out-of-character. (I suspect the actors were actually in a state of shock at having signed up for this project.) The romantic aspects were awkward and empty. And Jacob imprinted on the baby. Speaking of Jacob, just as in the book, he let me down. For, in the book, he seemed like the only one any sane, reasonable person could relate to, because he realized the insanity of the situation and what needed to be done to fix it, and yet in the end, he became a victim of the Body Snatchers, too.Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Rosemary's Baby; this movie carried similar themes to both of those films. It's too bad the writers didn't just outright abandon the idea of trying to keep the lovey-dovey nonsense in Breaking Down and just aim for a horror film from the start, because THAT might have worked. As it was, it ended up being a horror film anyway, just not the right kind. Horrified is the word I would use to describe a film that was all too clearly used by Meyer as a platform to promote her anti-choice religio-political views. It was like watching a public service announcement on the subject, it was so heavy-handed. Perhaps even more appalling were the other themes presented, such as pro-domestic abuse (or at the very least, pro-turn-a-blind-eye-to-it advice), pro-anorexia, and pro-arranged marriage. Some people have referred to the imprinting of Jacob and the baby as bordering on pedophilia. I think maybe that's overstating it a little. But there's no denying the disturbing implications of the adult Jacob exchanging a meaningful we're-meant-to-be-mates-someday gaze with Bella's newborn infant. Truly shudder-worthy. And don't even try to argue that the wolf imprinting wasn't about mating, as the Tweens, in their denial and blind devotion to Meyer have tried to do. I'm sickened that the studio would invest in something aimed at young adults that contained so many twisted and disturbing messages. Then again, looking at the not-so-special special effects, they didn't invest that much.  There were moments it felt like I was watching the CW.It's sad to see the 5-star reviews for this.  5 stars? Really?  (Although, it quickly becomes noticeable how brief those reviews usually are, having not much to support the rating.)  I have to wonder, though, if these people have ever seen an actual good movie or read an actual good book in their lives, or else they're just not very discerning in their tastes and judgement.  Sadder still is that publishers and Hollywood pander to this indiscriminate demographic. :/I was going to add an extra star for the costume designer's wedding gown creation. It was very lovely, and I know they had no guidelines to go by, considering that Meyer only bothered to describe it in her book as... what was the word? ""Gorgeous""? Oh yes, that was helpful. However, I have to take that star right back because I was continually distracted throughout the movie (which may have been a good thing) by wondering what was up with all the Cullens's hair. It appeared to me as if they were all wearing cheap wigs. I'm not sure if they were or not, but I kept noticing it, so....Then again, I am giving the second star right back for one wonderful addition to the movie that occurred as an addendum during the closing credits: that of Aro having his receptionist killed due to her poor spelling and grammar.Honestly, the only useful message this movie offered. Take it to heart, kids. :)",2,On the Upside the Credits Do Finally Come....,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,5436,"['.but', 'long', 'two', 'hours', 'do.Breaking', 'Dawn', 'book', 'was', 'unequivocally',

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[1, 2]","Granted my husband and I are not the target demographic for this movie, so perhaps I am judging it a bit harshly, but I felt this dragged. The romance between Edward and Bella is lovely, and all the settings and filming are beautiful (their wedding is exquisite), but splitting Breaking Dawn into 2 parts, and focusing exclusively on the romance side in this part, diminished the opportunity for action in this film, and that left the pacing slow for anyone who isn't completely in it for the romance alone. Granted, there are some wolf/vampire fighting scenes, but there isn't an overall arc of action, like there was with 'bad vampires' Victoria or Laurent in the earlier movies. So there's no real suspense or fear, which is a problem in a vampire movie. There's also a few scenes with Jacob that are written in such a way that they don't seem to make a lot of sense, although they did in the book. Also, the sound-quality when the wolves are 'talking' psychically was a bit hokey, and diminished those scenes.So, if you're a fan, and mostly one of Edward and Bella's romance, you might love this, but if you're in it for the action, this won't be the film for you.

1261234,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B002BWP49C,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[455, 541]","I just saw ""Breaking Dawn"" part 1, and I was VERY impressed, even if as a man I am probably not the most typical fan of ""Twilight"" series. I rather liked all the ""Twilight"" movies until now and this one is, to my personnal taste, as good as the previous ones - and even in one aspect a little bit better, as Edward and Bella finally become lovers. Below, you will find a short description of what I believe are the best elements of this film, with very limited SPOILERS:1. Actors. All actors evolved as the serie continued and I believe they all got better with time. Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are both excellent, but - in my humble opinion - it is Kristen Stewart who in this movie shines the most. Quite a lot of people frequently criticized her actorship claiming that she simply can not play at all and has a very limited assortment of expressions in her tool box. But for me, after reading ""Twilight"" books, this is how the character of Bella should be. I can hardly picture her wide smiling with all her teeth bared or doing any other highly extraverted things like that. In fact I believe that either by design or by accident Kristen Stewart got the things right about this character - her minimalistic approach to facial expressions actually makes (for me) Bella very believable and also quite likeable. In this part of the story, Bella takes a more dynamic approach to life by taking her destiny firmly under control. She makes important decisions and takes extreme risks, stubbornly resisting the opposite advice of all her family and friends - all of that in a deceptively unassuming way... And Kristen Stewart acted in the movie exactly as I pictured Bella did it, when I read the books. A very good job!Other actors are also great, with Ashley Greene and Billy Burke being as usual the pillars - but amongst the supporting roles it is Nikki Reed who really gets the most praise from me. She has a much bigger role in this film and she is perfect in it! The one (little) disappointment is Jackson Rathbone, who changed comletely his haircut for this film and as a result his character, Jasper, seems much less impressive, which is a pity. He also seems to appear very little in the ""first line"", almost as if the director preferred to hide him a little...2. Visual aspects. As usual, the images of state of Washington are great, but the tropical island where Bella and Edward spend their honey moon is also very pleasantly showed. Dark forests filled with (were)wolves are very much present here and they are a great background for the story.3. Music. As usual in those series, music and songs have been selected very carefully and with a great taste.4. The (were)wolf pack. The Quileute wolves are shown here even more and better than in the previous part. The scene of their war council, when they are all in the werewolf form, is absolutely great! The scene when Sam (the alpha male) asserts and confirms his power over the pack is excellent - as good as the description of Jacob's defiance and its consequences.5. The wedding. A very nice and moving scene with some humour elements, especially when the guests make speeches offering toasts. Emmett, Jessica and Bella's father give here a great show. In the same time Mike Newton obsesses on vampire bridesmaids from the Denali clan, to the point of drooling (and I TOTALLY understand him!). Bella's mum and, suprprise surprise, Rosalie (!) are also real treasures in wedding scenes.6. Quileute wolves vs. Cullen coven confrontation. This heartbreaking, tense and at moments violent conflict in which both sides are trapped against their will is a great moment in the Twilight saga - and its final resolution is even better! Finally it is true what the Beatles were singing - all you need is love! Babies help too...7. The fight for Bella's life, Renesmee's bloody birth and Bella's fate - excellent! Those were moments very difficult to film - but the challenge was met succesfully! Nothing more about it to avoid more spoilers, but I was very impressed!Conclusion: it is an excellent movie which I watched with great pleasure. My wife, who usually is a much harder person to please, loved it too and she is going to see it again with some girlfriends. And we will certainly both wait with great expectations for the ""Breaking dawn"" part 2. If it was done as well as that one, it will be certainly worth waiting one year to see it...",5,"A very tasty story about love and death dancing with wolves, mixing happiness and sadness, despair and hope - and sex and blood!",1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,4409,"['just', 'saw', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'part', '1', 'was', 'VERY', 'impressed', 'even', 'man', 'am', 'probably', 'not', 'most', 'typical', 'fan', 'Twilight', 'series', 'rather', 'liked', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'now', 'one', 'personnal', 'taste', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'ones', 'even', 'one', 'aspect', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'finally', 'become', 'lovers', 'will', 'find', 'short', 'description', 'what', 'believe', 'are', 'best', 'elements', 'film', 'very', 'limited', 'SPOILERS:1', 'Actors', 'actors', 'evolved', 'serie', 'continued', 'believe', 'got', 'better', 'time', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'are', 'excellent', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'who', 'movie', 'most', 'lot', 'people', 'frequently', 'criticized', 'actorship', 'claiming', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'very', 'limited', 'assortment', 'expressions', 'tool', 'box', 'reading', 'Twilight', 'books', 'how', 'character', 'Bella', 'should', 'be', 'can', 'hardly', 'picture', 'wide', 'smiling', 'teeth', 'bared', 'doing', 'other', 'highly', 'extraverted', 'things', 'fact', 'believe', 'design', 'accident', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'got', 'things', 'right', 'character', 'minimalistic', 'approach', 'facial', 'expressions', 'actually', 'Bella', 'very', 'believable', 'also', 'quite', 'likeable', 'part', 'story', 'Bella', 'more', 'dynamic', 'approach', 'life', 'taking', 'destiny', 'firmly', 'control', 'important', 'decisions', 'extreme', 'risks', 'stubbornly', 'resisting', 'opposite', 'advice', 'family', 'friends', 'deceptively', 'unassuming', 'way', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'acted', 'movie', 'exactly', 'pictured', 'Bella', 'did', 'when', 'read', 'books', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Other', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'being', 'usual', 'pillars', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'who', 'really', 'most', 'praise', 'much', 'bigger', 'role', 'film', 'perfect', 'one', 'little', 'disappointment', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'who', 'changed', 'comletely', 'haircut', 'film', 'result', 'character', 'Jasper', 'much', 'less', 'impressive', 'pity', 'also', 'appear', 'very', 'little', 'first', 'line', 'almost', 'director', 'preferred', 'hide', 'little', '2', 'Visual', 'aspects', 'usual', 'images', 'state', 'Washington', 'are', 'great', 'tropical', 'island', 'where', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'spend', 'honey', 'moon', 'also', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'showed', 'Dark', 'filled', 'were', 'wolves', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'present', 'here', 'are', 'great', 'background', 'story.3', 'Music', 'usual', 'series', 'music', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'selected', 'very', 'carefully', 'great', 'taste.4', 'were', 'wolf', 'pack', 'Quileute', 'wolves', 'are', 'shown', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'better', 'previous', 'part', 'scene', 'war', 'council', 'when', 'are', 'werewolf', 'form', 'absolutely', 'great', 'scene', 'when', 'Sam', 'alpha', 'male', 'power', 'pack', 'excellent', 'as', 'good', 'description', 'Jacob', 'defiance', 'consequences.5', 'wedding', 'very', 'nice', 'moving', 'scene', 'humour', 'elements', 'especially', 'when', 'guests', 'make', 'speeches', 'offering', 'toasts', 'Emmett', 'Jessica', 'Bella', 'father', 'give', 'here', 'great', 'show', 'same', 'time', 'Mike', 'Newton', 'vampire', 'bridesmaids', 'Denali', 'clan', 'point', 'drooling', 'TOTALLY', 'understand', 'Bella', 'mum', 'suprprise', 'surprise', 'Rosalie', 'are', 'also', 'real', 'treasures', 'wedding', 'scenes.6', 'Quileute', 'vs.', 'Cullen', 'coven', 'confrontation', 'heartbreaking', 'tense', 'moments', 'violent', 'conflict', 'sides', 'are', 'trapped', 'will', 'great', 'moment', 'Twilight', 'saga', 'final', 'resolution', 'even', 'better', 'Finally', 'true', 'what', 'Beatles', 'were', 'singing', 'need', 'love', 'Babies', 'help', 'too', '7', 'fight', 'Bella', 'life', 'Renesmee', 'bloody', 'birth', 'Bella', 'fate', 'excellent', 'were', 'moments', 'very', 'difficult', 'film', 'challenge', 'was', 'met', 'succesfully', 'Nothing', 'more', 'avoid', 'more', 'spoilers', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Conclusion', 'excellent', 'movie', 'watched', 'great', 'pleasure', 'My', 'wife', 'who', 'usually', 'much', 'harder', 'person', 'please', 'loved', 'too', 'going', 'see', 'again', 'girlfriends', 'will', 'certainly', 'wait', 'great', 'expectations', 'Breaking', 'dawn', 'part', '2', 'was', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'certainly', 'worth', 'waiting', 'one', 'year', 'see']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

The ones who make the movie go for kids watching it only and that is far from the truth. The last book Breaking Dawn actually, i was disappointed. I did not like the view switching off Bella to Jacob. It should have been Edward...but should have stayed with Bella and Edward as to their thoughts etc. But, Waiting through 3 novels wondering when he was going to bite her and for them to get married..then there is hardly no honeymoon at all.. I was hoping the movie would be more romantic with at least showing as much as TV does. It was like, did they do it or not? I feel there should have been more scenes of Bella and Edward..not naked, but kissing ..cudding..making one think they were having sex on the honeymoon and after. It was too short, as to, they have sex 3 times in the book..twice in the movie and suddenly she is pregnant! Then, She turns away from Edward..who is her husband for gosh sakes and runs to Rosalie whom always disliked her...She could care less if she dies, if Edward has any say about the baby, if the baby is going to be a monster..instead all she cares about is that it is born..the whole point of the previous 3 novels/movies was for her to be with Edward and for him to bite her and have sex....I got married wehn i was 17 and pregnant by 18 and i can tell you, i did not even think of it as real until it was born and if they would have told me it was going to kill me etc...i certainly would not have went through the pregnancy. I remember too, being embarrassed by putting on sexy nightie or being naked. One thing, starting with the swim when they first arrive at The Isle could have been more romantic. Why cant they have an extended version at least on DVD that shows more? Edward always seemed to me like he had no desire to have sex with Bella and after he finally does it and sees he did not kill her...he never wants to do it again...even though she is happy and doesn't care that she has bruises..odd that she never feels pain..broken bones..bites etc...amd the honeymoon playing chess for gosh sakes! What couple just married would want to sit around playing chess? They would be out shopping, or touring or cudding on the beach etc.....Anyway..overall i was disappointed.....They also left out the parts where Jacob kept insulting Rose...the part that she has a new fancy car....I did not like it that they did not show the complete vows at the wedding..just bits of it....I was hoping the DVD i purchased might have an extened version of scenes they cut, but no such luck....I have seen movies on normal TV that show more of a couple on a honeymoon than this movie did....I was sort of stunned..not giving away ending..but they ended it like another popular movie.....Also..Why do the Cullens look different in each movie? Different hair styles etc..? I wish SM would write a book about Renesmee at least..but guess she is rich and could care less now...The bond between Bella and Edward seems to be missing in this movie and overall..i thought they could have done better with this film..or at least put a longer version out on DVD. This film seems to be afraid some 10 year old might see Bella and Edward having sex...for gosh sakes, it is the theme..them having sex for first time......at least they did not take focus off Bella like they did in the book....after 3 movies..looks like the Directors would have learned something..but overall, the 1st movie had more of the feel of the book...the relationship and the way they looked..especially Edward..in the next movies they have him dressed up in suits etc and he looks nothing like a 17 year old..and the 4 books are only like a year and a half time spam, so why do The Cullens etc etc always look so different? It seemed to me, SM'ers view of marriage is to not have sex, or as little as possible and having a baby is ultimate even if death comes from it....Do ones duty, no matter what!",4,Good,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,3948,"['do', 'love', 'Twilight', 'series', 'i', 'am', 'older', 'person', 'ones', 'who', 'make', 'movie', 'go', 'kids', 'watching', 'only', 'far', 'truth', 'last', 'book', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'actually', 'i', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'view', 'switching', 'off', 'Bella', 'Jacob', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Edward', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'thoughts', 'etc', 'Waiting', '3', 'novels', 'wondering', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'bite', 'get', 'married..then', 'hardly', 'honeymoon', 'all..', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'romantic', 'least', 'showing', 'as', 'much', 'TV', 'was', 'did', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'scenes', 'Bella', 'Edward..not', 'naked', 'kissing', '..cudding..making', 'one', 'think', 'were', 'having', 'sex', 'honeymoon', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'have', 'sex', '3', 'times', 'book..twice', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'pregnant', 'Then', 'away', 'Edward..who', 'husband', 'gosh', 'sakes', 'runs', 'Rosalie', 'whom', 'always', 'disliked', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Edward', 'say', 'baby', 'baby', 'going', 'be', 'monster..instead', 'about', 'born..the', 'whole', 'point', 'previous', '3', 'novels/movies', 'was', 'be', 'Edward', 'bite', 'have', 'sex', '.I', 'got', 'married', 'wehn', 'i', 'was', '17', 'pregnant', '18', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'think', 'real', 'was', 'born', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'etc', 'i', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'went', 'pregnancy', 'remember', 'too', 'being', 'embarrassed', 'putting', 'sexy', 'nightie', 'being', 'naked', 'One', 'thing', 'starting', 'swim', 'when', 'first', 'arrive', 'Isle', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'romantic', 'Why', 'cant', 'have', 'extended', 'version', 'least', 'DVD', 'more', 'Edward', 'always', 'seemed', 'had', 'desire', 'have', 'sex', 'Bella', 'finally', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'never', 'do', 'again', 'even', 'happy', ""n't"", 'care', 'bruises..odd', 'never', 'pain..broken', 'bones..bites', 'etc', 'honeymoon', 'playing', 'chess', 'gosh', 'sakes', 'What', 'couple', 'just', 'married', 'would', 'want', 'sit', 'around', 'playing', 'chess', 'would', 'be', 'shopping', 'touring', 'cudding', 'beach', 'etc', '..Anyway..overall', 'i', 'was', 'disappointed', '..They', 'also', 'left', 'out', 'parts', 'where', 'Jacob', 'kept', 'insulting', 'Rose', 'part', 'new', 'fancy', 'car', '.I', 'did', 'not', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'complete', 'vows', 'wedding..just', 'bits', '.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'DVD', 'i', 'purchased', 'might', 'have', 'extened', 'version', 'scenes', 'cut', 'such', 'luck', '.I', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'normal', 'TV', 'show', 'more', 'couple', 'honeymoon', 'movie', 'did', '.I', 'was', 'sort', 'stunned..not', 'giving', 'away', 'ended', 'popular', 'movie', 'do', 'Cullens', 'look', 'different', 'movie', 'Different', 'hair', 'styles', 'wish', 'SM', 'would', 'write', 'book', 'Renesmee', 'least..but', 'guess', 'rich', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'now', 'bond', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'be', 'missing', 'movie', 'overall..i', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'film..or', 'least', 'put', 'longer', 'version', 'DVD', 'film', 'be', 'afraid', '10', 'year', 'old', 'might', 'see', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'having', 'sex', 'gosh', 'sakes', 'theme..them', 'having', 'sex', 'first', 'time', 'least', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'focus', 'Bella', 'did', 'book', '.after', '3', 'movies..looks', 'Directors', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'something..but', 'overall', '1st', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'feel', 'book', 'relationship', 'way', 'looked..especially', 'Edward..in', 'next', 'movies', 'have', 'dressed', 'up', 'suits', 'etc', 'nothing', '17', 'year', 'old..and', '4', 'books', 'are', 'only', 'year', 'half', 'time', 'spam', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'Cullens', 'etc', 'etc', 'always', 'look', 'so', 'different', 'seemed', ""SM'ers"", 'view', 'marriage', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'having', 'baby', 'ultimate', 'even', 'death', '.Do', 'ones', 'duty', 'matter', 'what']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1
1261242,A1LXBTR6AJ5DZY,B002BWP49C,Marjorie R. Morrow,"[0, 0]","The Twilight Saga movies as well as the books are my favorites!  Stephenie Meyer, the author of the books, is a very inspired author with a fabulous imagination.  Her books have the classic impossible romance of a teen-aged girl in love with the impossibly handsome vampire; the actors chosen to portray these characters are very beievable, and these are very popular movies with a built-in cult fan base of all those readers who loved the books and want to see their imagination fulfilled.  In this 4th installment of the movies based on the books, we have the long-awaited beautiful wedding of Edward Cullen and his love, Bella Swan, then there's the third person in the triangle, Jacob, the Indian/werewolf/shape shifter also in love with Bella.  There's the rest of the Cullen family who are just as amazing, then there's Bella's father, the inimitable Chief of Police of the authentic town of Forks, Washington, who lends a comic touch in giving a toast to the groom reminding him that he ""can shoot a gun and can follow him to the ends of the earth because he's a cop""!  Then there's the honeymoon location (a surprise to Bella) on a deserted island named ""Isle Esme"" (a gift to Edward's ""mother"" Esme from her handsome vampire husband, Doctor Carlisle Cullen).  With Edward's strength, the honeymoon bed is wrecked and Bella awakens the next morning with pillow feathers floating about.  They, unbelievably conceive a child (unheard-of among a vampire married to a human) and go back home to Washington for the difficult pregnancy. A must for anyone who's read the series or is interested in the popular vampire phenomenon.

And, admittedly, the books are so terribly written, it's mind-numbing. But I love vampires and I have totally been drawn in by this story. The ""Breaking Dawn"" novel is my favorite installment in Stephenie Meyer's series, especially the first half of the book, which is what this film covers. And it's AWESOME! The lamest aspect of the film is the scene where the CGI wolves are all ""talking to each other"" in the woods. Very stupid. But the rest of the movie is great! Some people are saying that the film drags, but the first part of the book is really character-focused on Bella and Edward. There's no external drama for a change, except for the pissed off pack of wolves. And it's wonderful! Yes, I do wish the movie had been as graphic as the book. There should have been more sex and violence. But basically, this movie is ALL ABOUT sex and violence. What's not to love?! My understanding is that the producers needed to tone down a bunch of the graphic sex and, um, birth scenes so as to avoid an NC-17 rating or an R rating.

1261267,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B002BWP49C,M. Oleson,"[3, 5]","The art director in this film deserves some love for creating some very cool houses.  The house owned by Dr. Carlisle and his vampire brood is to die for.  Also when Edward and Belle go to an island off the coast of Rio de Janeiro for their honeymoon, their rented beach house is terribly romantic.  But who knew that when vampires make love they destroy their bedrooms.  This must get expensive if you have any sort of love life.Anyway, after much angst, Edward and Belle do get married but while on their honeymoon, she gets pregnant.  This is evidently a big surprise to all concerned.  A little research would have suggested it was possible so maybe some vamp size condoms would have been appropriate.  We also learn that vampire/human babies grow very rapidly and very aggressively.  After a short gestation period, Belle appears to be doomed if she goes ahead delivering the baby she definitely wants.  She can't be talked out of it.Jacob enters the picture again as the uncomfortable 3rd wheel, refusing to go away even after Belle is married and preggers.  Most of the movie is the usual moody, sullen, gloomy looks given to each other.  I've seen better acting on those Mexican soap operas.  I was hoping at least for the spawn to be some horrendous monster configuration but nope, she is the most adorable baby you've ever seen...and seems to have made an imprint on the jilted Jacob.  Now that sounds interesting.  Will Belle live?  I don't know, but I do know the final chapter of the series is due in the fall of 2012.The version of this movie I had was a Blu ray but for whatever reason only had the 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack.

From what I can tell, no extra fluff was included and the story flowed very well from start to finish without me having to constantly ask what was going on. Too many writers and directors assume that the audience is made up of diehard fans and skip too many vital parts, glad to see that this time was different. Well, if parts were skipped that is fine, because what I saw worked.Having not read the book, I had no idea what to expect in this show. Not sure how much to reveal here since any plot points will be a movie giveaway, all I can say is that the special effects people are geniuses. The visuals that they were able to accomplish are stunning and to my utter amazement, the flow was steady and at no time did I check my watch to see how much longer I had to sit there.The end, well, that was perfect.

The director made the most of the scenery, the music and the actor's nuances and abilities. ""Breaking Dawn"" was disappointing. I would have loved to have seen more Edward and Bella honeymoon moments.The wedding was lovely.  However the speeches (with the exception of Edward's, which was perfect!) were far too short.  In the book, Bella says that Renee and Esme got along like a house-on-fire.  There was none of this in the movie.  It would have been nice to see the two Mums helping Bella chose her wedding gown, the flowers etc.From the trailer, you're lead to believe that Edward and Bella spend some time dancing with the locals in Rio.  In reality they only spent approx. 5 seconds kissing in front of the locals.  It would have been lovely to see a lingering Bella/Edward street dancing scene very much in the style of the school ball finale in ""Twilight"".I liked the honeymoon.  However it needed to have more Edward and Bella walking along the beach, swimming in the moonlight, cuddling on the bed etc. Robert Pattinson has a beautiful smile.  His whole face lights up.  We needed to see more of it.  Robert also has very expressive eyes.  The film needed more of the Bella/Edward tender looks and touches.  A female director understands the romantic things that ladies love and want to see.There should have alot more Edward supporting Bella during her difficult pregnancy.  One of the best parts of the whole movie is when Jacob accidentally sees Bella and Edward on the couch in an inimate moment - enjoying and delighting in the miracle that they've created.Catherine Hardwicke did such a wonderful job directing ""Twilight"".

1261306,AQR22MPF45M3P,B002BWP49C,Rachel Ford,"[24, 73]","Seldom do I see movies that are profoundly, intrinsically reprehensible. Breaking Dawn was one of those movies. It's the sort of film that would-be abusers and pedophiles probably dream of; and so tedious that it will put the rest of us to sleep.This movie consists of three main events: a wedding, a honeymoon, and a pregnancy/birth. All of these are a thin veil for the true point of this film: that the noblest and rightest course of action a woman can take is to be cut open and bleed out for the sake of a fetus that every expert she's consulted predicts will die anyway. There is a lot of blood, gore and horror - but that's the ""romantic"" part. Somewhere, lost deep in this quagmire, are a few doomed attempts at excitement, but these are fleeting and inconsequential.I will discuss in more detail the movie as a whole, but first, what makes it truly appalling: the spousal abuse, irrational pro-fetus and anti-woman message, and pedophilic overtones. (spoilers below)First...the pro-woman-dying message (which consumes the entire latter part of the movie: the pregnancy/birth. I say ""pro-woman-dying"" because to call this pro-life is as hideous a travesty as calling Dr. Mengele ""pro-life"". This is not a story of a woman who finds herself pregnant and ""chooses life""; this is the story of a woman who finds herself pregnant, is told by experts (a doctor, and both a human and vampire woman with supernatural sight) that the baby and she will die, and, even as she is starving nigh unto death, persists in this doomed pregnancy. As an emergency delivery is necessitated, she is the one who demands that they cut her open before the pain killer has kicked in because ""he's suffocating!""; she is the one who gives the order for her stomach to be cut open and the infant removed, while she bleeds out on the table. Naturally, in this twisted fantasy, the baby *doesn't* die - and, although the skeletal Bella looks like she could be something out of Dr. Mengele's operating room as she bleeds out on the table, never fear. You see, being starved, having her ribs broken, and being gutted was only the prelude to an eternity of happily ever after - just as the doctor and the other people who had any way of knowing were wrong about the infant, they're wrong about her too: she is revived, lovelier and more alive than ever before. The effects of starvation are gone, the wounds are healed; and, on top of it all, she is now immortal. Choosing a gory, horrid death for yourself because you carry a zygote, you see, is really just the key to making all of your dreams come true.Secondly...spousal abuse. Bella wakes up after her wedding night to find their room torn to pieces and herself covered in bruises because, dontcha know, Edward ""can't control"" himself with her. She, of course, delighted in this encounter, and spends what seemed like an eternity chasing Edward (now remorseful, and swearing not to touch her) around their honeymoon island, begging for him to do it again. As with the first point, this is yet another appallingly backwards, misogynistic message for young people (this movie's target audience). Bella is only brutalized because he loves her so much; she loves it, begs for more, and gets it. So, don't worry girls...those bruises are a token of affection, and those hangups where you need to beg and beg and beg for intimacy are really your fault - because you do this to him!Finally...pedophilia. Jacob has, throughout the series, been an interesting cross of inflated ego and lack of testicular fortitude. Now, add to that illustrious resume, pedophile; because, maybe fifteen minutes after she's cut out of her non-sedated mother, Jacob comes in and ""imprints on"" Bella's newborn. If that sounds dirty, there's good cause; because (as was clearly stated earlier in the movie, for those fangirls who will try to delude themselves otherwise) he's marking her as his future mate - something that she has no control over, but will be forced to ""be happy"" with. Don't worry, though...Papa Edward does what any father would do, and radiates pride as he declares that his wife's ex has just ""imprinted on"" their fifteen minute old baby. Some people are naturals at parenting, right?These are the lowlights of this appalling waste of time. The full chronology of the movie goes something like this:Bella whines and pouts about having to wear a dress and heels to her wedding.Edward reveals his ""rebel"" past, and vampires everywhere die of laughter.Bella has a nasty nightmare about her and Edward killing everyone at their wedding.Bella sulks through her wedding.Bella forces Edward to abuse her on their wedding night.Bella chases Edward around the island, for a long time, begging him to do it again.Bella ends up crying because of Edward's rejection; Edward finally gives in.Bella realizes she's pregnant; the big bad wolves (Jacob's pack) aren't happy.Bella almost starves to death; Jacob rebels against the wolves, and swears to protect Bella.Bella gets cut open and bleeds to death.Jacob imprints on the infant; the nasty wolves go home.Everyone is happy. Hooray.I cannot emphasize enough what utter trash this movie is. The first three were enjoyable; this is complete tripe. The author's perverse fundamentalism overshadows everything else, and this becomes not a silly romance, but an appalling piece of misogynist propaganda. Save your time and money; if you're really desperate, find some drying paint to watch. That will be more entertaining, and less offensive.",1,"Cinema cesspool -- boring, bizarre, misogynist",1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,5498,"['Seldom', 'do', 'see', 'movies', 'are', 'profoundly',

1261309,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B002BWP49C,Ranny Levy,"[0, 0]","Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn pt. 2 is the final installment in the Twilight series, adapted from Stephenie Meyer's novels. This dramatic ending concludes the tale of Bella and Edward on their journey, defying the odds of love. I have never really been a fan of the Twilight series, never read any of the books or waited in line at the midnight premieres. I'm not a huge fan of dairy products, and this series contains an awful lot of cheese. But food jokes aside, I didn't completely dislike this film. Don't get me wrong there were definitely some parts that were way too dramatic, but overall I would say this is by far the best film in the Twilight Saga.The cinematography and special effects weren't anything different from the previous films, so I think they were pretty well done. However, I was very confused when I saw Renesmee. I couldn't tell if she was real or not because she looked so computer edited. I also have a problem with Bella's makeup in the opening scene. This movie picks up right where it left off and in the last film, the final scene is Bella lying on the table after she gives birth. When this movie starts, it is Bella waking up on the table two days after the birth of her daughter. But her makeup and hair are perfect. If she had been unconscious for two days how would she have on spotless makeup? Another detail that I noticed that didn't seem right was Edward and Bella's new home. Who made it? And who could design, build and furnish an entire home in only two days? I pretty sure vampires don't have super-human-carpenter powers. One last visual detail that was weird for me was Renesmee's room. When you first see it, it's a nursery, but then a day or two later it's completely different and completely refurbished. How on earth do the Collins afford to refurbish their homes every week?!I can't say I have a favorite character because the acting done by each character is a little far-fetched. I understand that the story line itself is far from realistic, but I feel like all of the actors over-played their roles. I do have a favorite scene though. The final battle scene completely shocked me, and made me actually enjoy the movie. I haven't read the books so I had no idea what to expect, but I got completely sucked into it. I watched this film with my friend who isn't a Twilight fan either, but she and I were squealing in shock during the ending scene. After the movie I felt like such a nerd because I got so into the film, but in all honesty I actually enjoyed it. No, I will not become a Twi-hard fan now, but I do have a lot more respect for this series now. And I'm thinking about reading the books.This film is the most violent and sexual out of the whole series so I recommend it for ages 13 and up. Obviously if you're a huge Twilight fanatic, you're going to see this movie no matter what anybody else tells you. And if you completely despise the movies (which I'm sure some of you probably do) you're not going to see the film no matter what your told.

1261310,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B002BWP49C,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[3, 9]","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part I continues the trend of a series of films that have successfully attracted a popular following for fans and upcoming fans alike.  And when comparisons arise within most recent times, one major film box office competitor comes to mind, the Harry Potter series that concluded its run with a two-part climax.  Breaking Dawn does quite the same with Part I with the three major actors Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen), Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan), and Taylor Lautner (Jacob Black) reprising their roles as vampire, mortal, and wolf; with the last three films that showed the spurts, growth, and ups and downs of their friendship, there appears to be much growth that showed within the fourth film of how that friendship was tested.For the most part, the film begins with preparations made for Edward and Bella's wedding.  And no different from a wedding between two mortals, there also appears to be the so-called cold feet and anxiety, especially between vampire and mortal.  However, it is Bella's premonitions and nightmares that clearly show her anxieties.  But as viewers will see, there is a difference between nightmares and reality.  As the film proceeds, the never ending tensions between Edward and Jacob are evident, and outside the circle of friendship between Edward, Jacob, and Bella that is depicted within the film, one may think that the film may progress within the same lines as the last two films - the intense emotions of jealously and rivalry.  But in Breaking Dawn, one may see the maturity that develops especially between Edward and Jacob that derives from exterior tensions and rivalries outside their circle but between their respective families of vampires and wolves.  And what breaks the tension temporarily, the laws of nature and family history that comes in the form of the birth of a new addition.Breaking Dawn Part I has an intensity that differs from the last three films.  And like Harry Potter, fans and new fans may be impatient for the next and last installment.  But no doubt, the ending of this film may have viewers at the edge of their seat especially with last hour that ended with a suspenseful and surprised ending - it's all in the eyes.",5,Bone Crunching and Suspenseful,1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,2222,"['Twilight', 'Saga', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', 'trend', 'series', 'films', 'have', 'successfully', 'attracted', 'popular', 'following', 'fans', 'upcoming', 'fans', 'alike', 'when', 'comparisons', 'arise', 'most', 'recent', 'times', 'one', 'major', 'film', 'box', 'office', 'competitor', 'mind', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'concluded', 'run', 'two-part', 'climax', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'quite', 'same', 'Part', 'three', 'major', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'Jacob', 'Black', 'reprising', 'roles', 'vampire', 'mortal', 'wolf', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'showed', 'spurts', 'growth', 'ups', 'downs', 'friendship', 'be', 'much', 'growth', 'showed', 'fourth', 'film', 'how', 'friendship', 'was', 'tested.For', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'preparations', 'made', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'wedding', 'different', 'wedding', 'two', 'mortals', 'also', 'be', 'so-called', 'cold', 'feet', 'anxiety', 'especially', 'vampire', 'mortal', 'However', 'Bella', 'premonitions', 'nightmares', 'clearly', 'show', 'anxieties', 'viewers', 'will', 'see', 'difference', 'nightmares', 'reality', 'film', 'proceeds', 'never', 'ending', 'tensions', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'are', 'evident', 'circle', 'friendship', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'Bella', 'depicted', 'film', 'one', 'may', 'think', 'film', 'may', 'progress', 'same', 'lines', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'intense', 'emotions', 'jealously', 'rivalry', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'one', 'may', 'see', 'maturity', 'especially', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'exterior', 'tensions', 'rivalries', 'circle', 'respective', 'families', 'vampires', 'wolves', 'what', 'tension', 'temporarily', 'laws', 'nature', 'family', 'history', 'form', 'birth', 'new', 'addition.Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', 'intensity', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fans', 'new', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'impatient', 'next', 'last', 'installment', 'doubt', 'ending', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seat', 'especially', 'last', 'hour', 'ended', 'suspenseful', 'surprised', 'ending', 'eyes']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

And if you are contemplating having a baby with a vampire, then you REALLY don't want to catch this fourth film based on the series of phenomenally successful novels by Stephanie Meyer.In this installment, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her dreamy vampire boyfriend Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally get hitched, but happiness is fleeting for the newlyweds as the still-human Bella finds herself coping with the most disturbing and problematic movie pregnancy since ""Rosemary's Baby"" (or ""Alien,"" if you want to count that as a pregnancy).In purely narrative terms, this is a fairly static entry in the series, as Bella wastes away to skeletal status through the ordeal, and everyone sits around discussing the moral implications of having an unprecedented cross-species child, especially when the birth experience itself will likely spell death for the mother.  There's a halfhearted attempt at revving up the action when the werewolves threaten to intervene by killing Bella, but the star-crossed and loyalty-divided Jacob (Taylor Lautner) defuses the situation in quick order (it also leads to a ludicrous voiceover conversation among the wolves that provides some unintentional laughs for the audience).Still, Stewart gets to do more intense acting than she has thus far in the series, and Bella's transformation plus the addition of the child offer new story possibilities for ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2,"" due for release in November 2012.",2,action largely washed away by suds,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,1712,"['**1/2If', ""'re"", 'developing', 'cold', 'feet', 'prospect', 'tying', 'knot', 'especially', 'happen', 'be', 'human', 'intended', 'vampire', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'watching', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', '1', 'written', 'Melissa', 'Rosenberg', 'directed', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'are', 'contemplating', 'having', 'baby', 'vampire', 'then', 'REALLY', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'catch', 'fourth', 'film', 'based', 'series', 'phenomenally', 'successful', 'novels', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer.In', 'installment', 'Bella', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'dreamy', 'vampire', 'boyfriend', 'Edward', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'finally', 'get', 'hitched', 'happiness', 'fleeting', 'newlyweds', 'still-human', 'Bella', 'coping', 'most', 'disturbing', 'problematic', 'movie', 'pregnancy', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Alien', 'want', 'count', 'pregnancy', 'purely', 'narrative', 'terms', 'fairly', 'static', 'entry', 'series', 'Bella', 'away', 'skeletal', 'status', 'ordeal', 'everyone', 'sits', 'discussing', 'moral', 'implications', 'having', 'unprecedented', 'cross-species', 'child', 'especially', 'when', 'birth', 'experience', 'will', 'likely', 'spell', 'death', 'mother', 'halfhearted', 'attempt', 'revving', 'up', 'action', 'when', 'werewolves', 'threaten', 'intervene', 'killing', 'Bella', 'star-crossed', 'loyalty-divided', 'Jacob', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'situation', 'quick', 'order', 'also', 'ludicrous', 'voiceover', 'conversation', 'wolves', 'unintentional', 'laughs', 'audience', '.Still', 'Stewart', 'do', 'more', 'intense', 'acting', 'thus', 'far', 'series', 'Bella', 'transformation', 'addition', 'child', 'offer', 'new', 'story', 'possibilities', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', '2', 'due', 'release', 'November', '2012']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

The wedding was way too drawn out, and boring to the point that I actually nodded-off, and fell asleep a few times. We do not need, to waste (1) hour demonstrating a wedding, to include a soft porn honey moon (sex) scene to make a point! The wedding and the pregnancy could have been gently explained in 20 minutes. Furthermore, I don't appreciate the honey moon soft porn sex scene! The pumping action in the bed was a bit much for (Parents) to view with their kids don't you think? That sex scene was kind of long and drawn out, and very unnecessary for kids to see. The producers need to realize that (Parents) are taking their kids to see this film, and I'm sure much embarrassment was caused by this sex scene. So finally after all the ""bull"" we finally get into the ""meat and potatoes"" of the script. But only the last (50) minutes of the movie was GREAT and on point! Great cinematography, great CGI, great effects and action. Great cliff-hanger!

(He has some of the best lines and he delivers them perfectly.) Bill Condon seems to really get the whole idea of this franchise, because the film is quite faithful to the plot and tone of the novel.There were some interesting contrasts in this film too.  The wardrobe and set dressing of the wedding were some of the most beautiful I've ever seen on film.  From the beauty of the wedding sequence the film progresses to the rather gruesome birthing.

There were some weak moments though.Cons: When I first saw ""Twilight (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" I thought, ""The action in this film leaves much to be desired."" I felt the same way about this film. The directors for ""New Moon"" and ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" made the vampires' movement much easier to believe. Like ""Twilight,"" the action in this film was a bit clumsy and even too unrealistic for a vampire movie. Watching the scene with Jasper and Emmett hopping up and down in the window before the ""bachelor party"" are prime examples of how the film got a little goofy when it could've been much better. In ""Breaking Dawn,"" they looked like they were jumping on trampolines and it was really lame. After the directors/producers already saw the right way of vampire movement, I don't understand why they reverted back to the amateur way of doing it. The extra dance twirls with Taylor and Kristen were a bit much, too. Once was enough. The rest reminded me of that awkward love scene in ""Abduction.""Pros: Unlike many women, I don't ooh and aww when I see a wedding dress, but even I had to applaud the dress that was picked for Bella. It was beautiful. My mouth dropped open when I saw the dress and Kristin Stewart looked amazing in it. I think Kristin got to show some more versatility in this film. I liked her comedic scenes when trying to coax Edward into having sex again after a very ""busy"" bedroom experience. I did not enjoy ""Breaking Dawn"" the book, but Bella's character was MUCH more likeable in the movie. I'm Team Jacob so any scene with Taylor Lautner and the rest of the wolfpack was enjoyable to me, and I really like Leah. I always wanted her to be more developed in the book so I'm hoping Part 2 continues to do that the way Part 1 does. Robert Pattinson was great, too, but I like the love rivalry with Jacob more. Actually the entire cast did a great job in this film like all others, and I liked the voices talking over each other with the wolves. That was the first time I saw that in action, and I thought that was a great idea considering they can all read each other's minds.That birth scene was graphic. I hid my head in my hood at one point because I was so grossed out by the chewing birth of this bloody demon baby. Ugh! This film is far more mature than the others. Can't wait to see Part 2. (I knew Part 1 was going to leave me counting down the days on my calendar again.

1261352,A2U7DXDNYBBLQJ,B002BWP49C,"Shane Windham ""Shane Windham, author""","[4, 7]","but this one really disappointed me. I enjoyed the second and third entries in this series. The first movie didn't move me much at all. But this one I found to be even worse than the first. And I genuinely didn't want to be of that opinion. I had heard negative things about this movie, but wanted to give it the benefit of my doubt; the way I do with almost everything receiving negative hype. In my experience, the negativity is almost always overstated, and things aren't as bad as people tend to be saying. Sadly, that is not the case with this film in my opinion.Firstly, I should point out that I'm normally a fan of films like this. I'm a male, but I really do enjoy a good love story. However this film felt like almost pure fluff. And the story wasn't sensible to begin with. If you had never seen another Twilight film, you would be utterly lost while watching this. Most of the CGI was obvious and overdone. Plainly put, the film focuses too much on the more trivial parts of the story, and tries too hard throughout.Part of what's wrong here is that this is where the storyline begins to break down in the arena of common sense. If you've ever been in a truly loving relationship, you're going to spend the entirety of your watching experience wondering why Bella's made the choice that she has. She loses her entire life in order to be with Edward, but doesn't seem to be any more needing of him than she is of Jacob. As an example, Jacob is called upon by Edward within the story to try and help Bella, because he has a deeper connection with Bella than Edward can understand. And had she chosen Jacob, the penalty to her reality would have been much less severe. This and many more flaws in the realism of the storyline make this hard to take to heart. It doesn't help that the scripting was terrible in most places.The argument between the wolves was almost impossible to follow; due to some very poor sound structuring. The birth scene was overly grotesque for a movie that spent half of its time focusing on a wedding and honeymoon. The vampires are no longer shimmering in this film. And...clearly, I was not pleased with a great many things about this film.If I had to point to a redeeming quality about this film, I would point to the imprint moment. And it was supremely heartfelt and moving. Again though, had I not known the storyline before watching this, I probably wouldn't have understood what I was even seeing. But do know that the imprint moment is excellent. This would have been a one star review otherwise. Even if you strip my feelings about the shoddy storyline away from this review, the direction of the film is still uninteresting and sloppy.I sincerely wanted to like this film. But I didn't. You may feel differently. And that's to be expected. But I consider it appropriate to give my honest opinion in all cases. And, in the case of this film, my opinion isn't a positive one. There are better movies to spend twenty dollars on. Even when this is a five dollar film, there will still be better movies to be had. Watch it if you must (most will still want to, and I get that). But don't say I didn't warn you that this one really is worthy of passing on.",2,I hate to admit it...,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,3196,"['one', 'really', 'disappointed', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'third', 'entries', 'series', 'first', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'much', 'one', 'found', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'first', 'genuinely', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'opinion', 'had', 'heard', 'negative', 'things', 'movie', 'wanted', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'way', 'do', 'almost', 'everything', 'receiving', 'negative', 'hype', 'experience', 'negativity', 'almost', 'always', 'overstated', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'tend', 'be', 'saying', 'Sadly', 'not', 'case', 'film', 'opinion.Firstly', 'should', 'point', 'out', ""'m"", 'normally', 'fan', 'films', ""'m"", 'male', 'really', 'do', 'enjoy', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'However', 'film', 'felt', 'almost', 'pure', 'fluff', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'sensible', 'begin', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Twilight', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'utterly', 'lost', 'watching', 'Most', 'CGI', 'was', 'obvious', 'overdone', 'Plainly', 'put', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'trivial', 'parts', 'story', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'throughout.Part', 'what', 'wrong', 'here', 'where', 'storyline', 'break', 'down', 'arena', 'common', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'truly', 'loving', 'relationship', ""'re"", 'going', 'spend', 'entirety', 'watching', 'experience', 'wondering', 'why', 'Bella', 'made', 'choice', 'entire', 'life', 'order', 'be', 'Edward', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'needing', 'Jacob', 'example', 'Jacob', 'called', 'Edward', 'story', 'try', 'help', 'Bella', 'deeper', 'connection', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'can', 'understand', 'had', 'chosen', 'Jacob', 'penalty', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'less', 'severe', 'many', 'more', 'flaws', 'realism', 'storyline', 'make', 'hard', 'take', 'heart', ""n't"", 'help', 'scripting', 'was', 'terrible', 'most', 'places.The', 'argument', 'wolves', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'follow', 'due', 'very', 'poor', 'sound', 'structuring', 'birth', 'scene', 'was', 'overly', 'grotesque', 'movie', 'spent', 'half', 'time', 'focusing', 'wedding', 'honeymoon', 'vampires', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'shimmering', 'film', 'clearly', 'was', 'not', 'pleased', 'great', 'many', 'things', 'film.If', 'had', 'point', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'film', 'would', 'point', 'imprint', 'moment', 'was', 'supremely', 'heartfelt', 'moving', 'Again', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'storyline', 'watching', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'even', 'seeing', 'do', 'know', 'imprint', 'moment', 'excellent', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'otherwise', 'Even', 'strip', 'feelings', 'shoddy', 'storyline', 'away', 'review', 'direction', 'film', 'still', 'uninteresting', 'sloppy.I', 'sincerely', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'may', 'feel', 'differently', 'be', 'expected', 'consider', 'appropriate', 'give', 'honest', 'opinion', 'cases', 'case', 'film', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'positive', 'one', 'are', 'better', 'movies', 'spend', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'Even', 'when', 'five', 'dollar', 'film', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'better', 'movies', 'be', 'had', 'Watch', 'must', 'most', 'will', 'still', 'want', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'one', 'really', 'worthy', 'passing']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

I gain from other reviewers that the die hard twilight fans that have read the books may love the movie more, or be more critical or downright mad/disapointed, Im neither, Ive watched the entire saga with my family and ""Breaking Dawn"" had a few highs and low'sA point of intrest is there are a few scenes in the movie that you wont get or understand if you have not read the books, I only know this from reading others detailed reviews.SPOILER ALERT.. your faired warned.  The part with the wolves talking was just awfull, bad CG, and the fact that this ability only shows up in this movie is a little hokie, Bella's walk with her dad down the Isle before she lays eyes on Edward was also Horrable, she looked like she was in pain, not mental anguish but real pain.. I also agree that the whole ""sparkly vampire issue"" is true, why dont they sparkle in this movie ? The lovemaking scene that these movies have led up to this point was a big letdown, im not asking for porn but they coulda done alot better. If you can get past this stuff and take the movie for exactly what it is and not what you want it to be if your a die hard fan you can get some enjoyment out of it, I put my feet up, got snacks and crashed on the couch.. I think the Overall acting in this last installment is better than previous twilight movies, there's less fighting action, and just more storytelling.. a few parts drag but overall its a fun popcorn movie to continue on with the Twilight saga. i gave it 3 stars instead of four becouse the parts of the movie that i commented on were BAD and truly brought my opinion down.. and tweaked my overall opinion of the movie.

The action doesn't pick up until the last 40 minutes or so.The greatest tension is created by the question of Bella's survival.

Like others, I greatly anticipated the Breaking Dawn movie and their relationship moving forward.  However, I don't think this director likes vampires.  It seems to me BD takes away the fantasy (for the most part) and replaces it with just a teenage love story.  Do I love the story...sure, but the fantasy is the vampire/human relationship.  Condon takes away the make-up...no pearly white, sparkly vampires in this flick!  Also, I have to mention the hair...Almost everyone changes, Edward goes much shorter, Jasper gets a cut and color, Rosalie (Blondie) goes brunette, Carlisle...etc.  I want my vampires sparkly and beautiful, darn it!  Some of the best book material was totally overlooked, i.e., before/after cars, telling Charlie of the marriage plans, the wedding fittings, etc.  However, we get stupid toasts at the wedding for comic relief??? And an extended shot of Rio's street dancers????  If you blink, you'll miss the much anticipated wedding night...no Edward making eggs endlessly for Bella, no snuggling and movie watching.  When we get home to Forks, all our vampires (who are now extremely humanized) are busy..no statues here, and the wolves have turned into cartoon figures complete with dialogue.  The Cullen home doesn't even seem to have the allure of the previous movies.  Bella's final scenes - not in the tight ice blue dress of the book, but flowing cobalt.  Yes, I'll see the next one, but I won't anticipate it quite the same way knowing that it will pick up where this one left off and I can't help but wonder, what changes I'll notice next.

I really enjoy this movie. The scenes I enjoy most in Twilight Sega: Breaking Dawn is with the wolfs. I am a wolf lover. I even have a wolf dog. I think they did a great job making those wolfs. The way they act, move, and attack is great to watch!!!!Three stars I rated on here wasn't for the movie. It was for the blu ray that I own. I think Blu ray sucks!!!!

Right before it goes to main menu it tells me that not all blu rays are able to play. After reading that I have to sit and wait for it to load even longer.I'm sorry Blu ray fan's, but I don't have a dvd that gives me any problems like that. The reason I am talking about this on here is because before I sit down to enjoy a movie I like to watch the special features first. I was almost done watching all of the special features on this blu ray, or at less the one I own. I don't know if all of the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn blu rays have this problem. But n e who, after the special features there is a What's New option. Which I am guessing is previews. I don't have cable because I have a lot of dvd's to watch. I like to watch the previews on the dvd/blu rays so I can see what new movies to add to my collection.Well when I clicked into Whats new with my remote it took forever to load just to tell me it's not able to read it and to try later.

1261404,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002BWP49C,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","I know I am not the film's target audience. Whoever the filmmakers are, they are not making the ""Twilight"" saga for a forty-something male, who is not a big fan of the vampire / romance genre. But when Bill Condon, director of such films as ""Gods and Monsters"" ""Kinsey"" and ""Dreamgirls"" is to helm ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn,"" I hoped things might be a bit different. Plus, the film's photography is by Guillermo Navarro, Oscar winner for ""Pan's Labyrinth.""So, having watched ""Part 1"" of the two-part finale of the franchise, I still don't know what to say about it. Though I don't think the film is as terrible as some critics say, the film often feels like a long and slow warm-up for the next installment, which I hope will be full of action. Well, in short, I thought ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn"" was pretty boring.The film takes nearly two hours to tell us what can be told in one hour (as Amazon's editorial review has neatly summarized). Edward and Bella marry, but a human-vampire marriage is not all romantic and sweet. Not a bad story, but more hints as to what is to come, or some subtexts under the melodramatic romance would have been of great help in interesting us, fans or non-fans of the series, in the drama between the married couple.We are also given chances to see the CG werewolves fighting, but not much, and the visual quality is at best acceptable. The subplot about Jacob and his clan, which could have been more interesting than the main plot, is sidelined by the birth scene that would seem very horrid to some. Technically the film is competent, and considering the drawn-out storyline, uninspired dialogue and bland acting from some, if not all, players, Bill Condon did a pretty good job as director.",2,A Very Long Warm-Up for the Up-Coming Part 2,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,1744,"['know', 'am', 'not', 'film', 'target', 'audience', 'Whoever', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'making', 'Twilight', 'saga', 'forty-something', 'male', 'who', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'vampire', '/', 'romance', 'genre', 'when', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'director', 'such', 'films', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'Kinsey', 'Dreamgirls', 'helm', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'hoped', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'different', 'film', 'photography', 'Guillermo', 'Navarro', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'So', 'having', 'watched', 'Part', '1', 'two-part', 'finale', 'franchise', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'as', 'terrible', 'critics', 'say', 'film', 'often', 'long', 'slow', 'warm-up', 'next', 'installment', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'full', 'action', 'Well', 'short', 'thought', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'was', 'pretty', 'boring.The', 'film', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'tell', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'one', 'hour', 'Amazon', 'editorial', 'review', 'neatly', 'summarized', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'marry', 'human-vampire', 'marriage', 'not', 'romantic', 'sweet', 'Not', 'bad', 'story', 'more', 'hints', 'what', 'come', 'subtexts', 'melodramatic', 'romance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'help', 'interesting', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'series', 'drama', 'married', 'couple.We', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'chances', 'see', 'CG', 'fighting', 'not', 'much', 'visual', 'quality', 'best', 'acceptable', 'subplot', 'Jacob', 'clan', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'main', 'plot', 'sidelined', 'birth', 'scene', 'would', 'seem', 'very', 'horrid', 'Technically', 'film', 'competent', 'considering', 'drawn-out', 'storyline', 'uninspired', 'dialogue', 'bland', 'acting', 'not', 'players', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'director']",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

1261406,A3C3TB9WPIUGTX,B002BWP49C,tyger88,"[3, 9]","I have not read the books so I didn't know what to expect from the beginning of the end of this series. I was more disappointed in the choices the new director made rather than in the storyline. Has this director even SEEN the other movies because nothing flowed properly with this movie at all. All of a sudden the vampires can be in full sunlight and not sparkle even a little bit...why is that? There were plenty of full sun scenes and none of the vampires sparkled, not even a little body glitter...nothing.The vampires makeup looked absolutely terrible this time. Seeing it at the theater made them look very pasty and sticky like their Mom's had packed on way too much grease paint for Halloween.Their eyes...at the wedding many of the vampire guests had very freaky looking red eyes and none of the human guests noticed?? The Cullens eyes seemed to switch all the time from gold, to black to gold...no idea why. Had they forgotten their contact lenses on some days?I also wasn't happy with the overly excessive use of music and staring...lots of staring set to music, it took the place of dialogue in many scenes. I didn't like the music selections this time, either. Very dull and forgettable. The other movies used music more appropriately and there were some very memorable, haunting songs that really stuck in your head. Not this time.The funniest part of all, the wolves ""talking"". Not a good idea and I nearly laughed out loud when they began to ""talk"" in their heads while still in wolf form and they could hear each other. This fact has been alluded to in the past, but we don't need to actually hear it. It could only have been made worse if they had made the wolves' mouths move in time to the words as many kiddie animal movies do. No, this scene would have played out much better if they had all been in human form. And yes, the wolves seemed much smaller and less imposing this time.Am I the only one who is left wondering why Edward said he could finally hear the baby's thoughts and then called it a HE when the baby was clearly a SHE? Was Edward simply lying to Bella to try to give her some comfort?I watched this movie with a friend who hasn't seen a single one of these yet, and she completely hated it. She said the vampires looked ugly and she asked how they could be in the sunlight? My point exactly.No, Breaking Dawn is not my favorite movie in this series. I think it could have been alot better with a different director.Now to address the three major concerns that have some reviewers in such an uproar...which I find to be rather silly, myself.1. Bella's bruises.I don't view Bella's bruises from her honeymoon as spousal abuse. Anyone who has seen this from the beginning knows that Edward has always been afraid of hurting Bella because vampires are so strong, which is why they have never been together before. Once he saw the bruises he was horrified and did his best to avoid her. Bella pursued and seduced him because she wanted to feel human for as long as possible, not because she liked being hurt. She knew that feelings and sensations would change once she was no longer human, that's all, nothing abusive or perverse about it.2. Bella's choice to keep the baby even though it could end her own life.Bella knew that keeping their baby was her one and ONLY chance to have a child, once she became a vampire, no chance of babies. When she discovered she was pregnant against all odds...they didn't think it could happen, she chose to keep it because she hadn't realized before how much she wanted a baby.  Bella has also witnessed Rosalie's pain and anguish from never having a child of her own. So yes, Bella did risk her own life to save the baby, but she had always intended to be turned into a vampire, so she expected to be turned at the last minute of death, like the others in the Cullen family.3. Jacob imprinting on the baby.I was not offended by Jacob's imprinting on the newborn, I don't understand how anyone can view that as pedophilia. I see it as Jacob's ultimate sacrifice for Bella. He is now the protector and guardian of Renesmee. Jacob knows he can't have Bella and he refuses to love anyone else, so he chose to use his imprint to save the life of her newborn that she fought so desperately to bring into the world. That in no way means he intends to make the baby his bride. Jacob knew that if he imprinted on the baby, all the wolves would have to respect that (their ultimate law) and not kill the baby or harm her in the future. Edward was humbled and proud to announce the fact that Jacob imprinted on the baby because he knew what a great sacrifice it was for Jacob to go against his pack and save the child's life. Jacob will lead a solitary life without a mate because he chose to be the protector of Bella's baby. Jacob loves Bella, she loves Edward and the baby so Jacob saved the baby's life for Bella. That's all. Nothing pervy about it. Some people need to quit slanting things to their own sick, twisted way of thinking. And by the way...these are just fiction books and movies. They are not intended for real-life interpretations or representations...so why on Earth would anyone be so offended by a movie? No one is forcing you to watch, so don't.",4,Not my favorite in the series...,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,5228,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'beginning',

I know that the big thing is to split the final installment of a saga to really get all the details of the plot out, seriously for this case this was really just about how much money Summit Entertainment could pocket from billions of pathetic teen-aged women.The plot is so shallow and simple a 6 month old can probably figure it out. No one wants to see Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattenson do ANYTHING  of the sort together that was in this film. Terrible dialogue, unearthly script and just a waste of my precious time.

Even when she receives a warm welcome, her mood stays as dark as the grey skies over the Pacific Northwest. Soon, she meets Edward, a Steppenwolf character. He's handsome enough, but a loner and a mystery, the kind that Bella would like to solve. When she's assigned to his lab bench in science class, he nearly bolts like a spooked horse. That just tweaks her interest even more.Then an out-of-control car nearly crushes her. Edward 'pushes her out of the way,' or so she tells people. The truth is far stranger, though, and leads her to solve his mystery. That (plus the fact that he just saved her life) just commits her to him even more. Much to everyone's surprise, including his own, he reciprocates. Although Bella's father worries that he's a little old for her - if he only knew! - only a biologically driven tension really invades their happiness. Oh, and a couple of thoroughly bad badguys.Some nice moments follow, including a ""meet the family"" scene with more than usual awkwardness. We see some realistically poor teen judgement, too, the kind so believably motivated by an overheated romantic sense. Giving away much more of the plot would mean giving too much away, but there's some good action, fearful moments that never go too far, and charming humor at the family baseball game.This could have been a mess of a genre-hopping teen romance flick, but the pieces came together nicely.
