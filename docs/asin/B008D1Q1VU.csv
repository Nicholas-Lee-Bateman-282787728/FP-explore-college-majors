1550534,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B008D1Q1VU,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[17, 18]","This is a set of four DVD's starring Cary Grant packed onto one hub in an economical set from TCM.MY FAVORITE WIFE (1940) has Nick Arden (Cary Grant) remarrying immediately after his first wife, Ellen Wagstaff Arden (Irene Dunne) was declared dead, seven years to the day she was lost at sea.  But Cary can't consummate the new marriage because Ellen comes back and keeps getting in the way, even posing as an old family friend to reacquaint herself with her children.  What's worse, Ellen was shipwrecked on an uncharted island with hunky ""Adam"" (Randolph Scott) for all those years.  Cary has to contend with his jealousy and the moral and legal complications of having two wives and not quite knowing what to do with either.  A very funny comedy of errors that holds interest all the way through.  The attempted 1962 remake of this movie, SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE, halted production when Marilyn Monroe died but was remade in 1963 as MOVE OVER, DARLING with James Garner and Doris Day.In THE BACHELOR AND THE BOBBY-SOXER (1947), Cary plays a professional artist and amateur bon vivant who keeps getting into scrapes at night clubs.  Cary comes before a judge (Myrna Loy) who ""sentences"" Cary to go out with her teen-aged sister (Shirley Temple), who has become infatuated with him when he spoke at her high school.  Cary retaliates by out-teening the teenagers; the ""power of Hoodoo"" slang exchange is a classic.  An accomplished supporting cast and bright writing by Sidney Sheldon (watch for the ""birthday cake"" night-club scene) made this a well-deserved hit.MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE (1948) reunites Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, this time as an overcrowded Manhattan couple with kids who commission a brand-new house in Connecticut.  What could go wrong?  Everything, and the film nicely balances satire and slapstick.  Melvyn Douglas is on hand as the family friend whose sardonic view of things punches up the topical satire.  This film was semi-remade as THE MONEY PIT in the 1980s.  Families newly arrived to ""the country"" from the city will recognize the problems of 1948 as still funny today.  A top hit.If there is a weak link in this chain of hits, it must be NIGHT AND DAY (1946, Color, Warner Bros.), which miscasts Cary Grant as writer-composer Cole Porter.  It's a largely fictionalized biopic which doesn't even hint at Porter's homosexuality but has him in an on-again, off-again marriage to a wealthy woman (played by Alexis Smith), who keeps getting pushed to the side due to Porter's workaholic involvement in musical theater.  The best part of this film is the many Cole Porter songs ""sold"" to us by such talents as Jane Wyman, Eve Arden, and Mary Martin.  The look of this film is terrible; if I had not known better I'd have sworn it was colorized, and not very well at that.  NIGHT AND DAY runs 128 minutes but seems longer.Other than NIGHT AND DAY these are legendary Hollywood black-and-white comedies and well worth owning.  This set makes them quite affordable.IMDb ratings:MY FAVORITE WIFE - 7.3NIGHT AND DAY - 6.1THE BACHELOR AND THE BOBBY-SOXER  -  7.2MR.

Curious though about the attempt at a bio of Cole Porter I googled him. His homosexuality IS hinted at in the movie and there is no romance developed - which makes this an oddball to stick with the other movies in itself, and a waste of time for me. It's not funny, Porter is portrayed as dull as the ladies in his life complain he is, and as a bio it's completely inaccurate. As a musical it's also a fail. Even though Porter wrote some classics, there were too many that were forgettable.But the other movies are classic Cary Grant and I had to give this stars for them.

While the acting is only as good as Grant ever is...it is the music and the production numbers that set this one apart.  Many great actors from the period are in this movie (singing & dancing) and it's great to get a glimps of them. But what this movie proves is that Cole Porter's music is still terrific today.  (But during WWII it was so new it was well, new).  If you like Cole Porter's music, you will enjoy this movie. If you don't know Cole Porter's music, you have to see this movie.
