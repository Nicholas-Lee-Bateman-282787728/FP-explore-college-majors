1077058,A20MXB65JKHMNC,B000QUEQ4U,Amazon Customer,"[11, 14]","First off, I do like the show, but not as the Dresden Files I know and love (i.e. the book series). Paul Blackthorne actually does a pretty good job, but doesn't quite come off as the overly-chivalrous, wiseass Harry of the books (and has yet to blow up as much stuff). I will say that Terrance Mann does a great Bob, one I like much better than the Bob of the books (who's a lot less British, a little less funny, and a little more horny), but the rest of the casting seems problematic to me. First of all, one of Murphy's leading characteristics was that she was short and blonde, and looked totally the opposite of a tough Chicago cop. Was it really necessary to change that (or make Susan Rodriguez a blonde for that matter?) or the multitude of storyline changes (like turning the evil adoptive father Justin DuMorne into Harry's uncle and changing his name to Morningway, this weird Bianca-as-nice-vamp-and-Harry's-ex thing, giving Murphy a kid, or the complete dismissal of the yet-unresolved and barely mentioned plotline centering around Murphy's dad?). Then there's the random prop changes (I don't think any fan of the books could honestly see Harry walking around with a hockey stick for a staff and a drumstick blasting rod, er `wand' for the uninitiated, and then there's the fact that we have yet to see Harry's infamous black leather duster) and I'm still not clear on why they made Mister orange. Is it really that difficult to track down a big grey tabby?I'm still waiting to see what the writers will do with characters like Michael, Thomas, Molly and Mouse (Harry's temple rhino, er puppy), if they bother to include them at all, and it would be nice to get some Sidhe politics and some of the vampire war eventually.Still, I can see where some of those changes were necessary. The TV series is definitely lacking in the gloom and doom of some of the books (especially the last few), but if it did remain completely faithful they probably wouldn't have gotten a following outside of fans of the novels.All in all, not a bad show when considered separately from the books, and for those who haven't read them, wait until you've seen a few episodes of the show, you'll enjoy it much more.",4,"Pretty good, but nothing compared to the books...",1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,2206,"['First', 'do', 'show', 'not', 'Dresden', 'Files', 'know', 'love', 'i.e', 'book', 'series', 'Paul', 'Blackthorne', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'off', 'overly-chivalrous', 'wiseass', 'Harry', 'books', 'yet', 'blow', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'stuff', 'will', 'say', 'Terrance', 'Mann', 'great', 'Bob', 'one', 'like', 'much', 'better', 'Bob', 'books', 'who', 'lot', 'less', 'British', 'little', 'less', 'funny', 'little', 'more', 'horny', 'rest', 'casting', 'problematic', 'First', 'one', 'Murphy', 'leading', 'characteristics', 'was', 'was', 'short', 'blonde', 'looked', 'totally', 'opposite', 'tough', 'Chicago', 'cop', 'Was', 'really', 'necessary', 'change', 'make', 'Susan', 'Rodriguez', 'blonde', 'matter', 'multitude', 'storyline', 'changes', 'turning', 'evil', 'adoptive', 'father', 'Justin', 'DuMorne', 'Harry', 'uncle', 'changing', 'name', 'Morningway', 'weird', ""Bianca-as-nice-vamp-and-Harry's-ex"", 'thing', 'giving', 'Murphy', 'kid', 'complete', 'dismissal', 'yet-unresolved', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'plotline', 'centering', 'Murphy', 'dad', 'Then', 'random', 'prop', 'changes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fan', 'books', 'could', 'honestly', 'see', 'Harry', 'walking', 'around', 'hockey', 'stick', 'staff', 'drumstick', 'blasting', 'rod', 'er', 'wand', 'uninitiated', 'then', 'fact', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Harry', 'infamous', 'black', 'leather', 'duster', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'clear', 'why', 'made', 'Mister', 'orange', 'really', 'difficult', 'track', 'down', 'big', 'grey', 'tabby', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'writers', 'will', 'do', 'characters', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'Molly', 'Mouse', 'Harry', 'temple', 'rhino', 'er', 'puppy', 'bother', 'include', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'get', 'Sidhe', 'politics', 'vampire', 'war', 'eventually.Still', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'changes', 'were', 'necessary', 'TV', 'series', 'definitely', 'lacking', 'gloom', 'doom', 'books', 'especially', 'last', 'few', 'did', 'remain', 'completely', 'faithful', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'following', 'outside', 'fans', 'novels.All', 'not', 'bad', 'show', 'when', 'considered', 'separately', 'books', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'wait', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'much', 'more']",The Dresden Files: Season 1

Don't base a character on the show as totally different from the books.  The two characters that drove me crazy in the show are Bianca and Butters.  Bianca in the books is one of Harry's greatest enemies and causes him all kinds of strive for many years.  Butters is portrayed as a goofy overnerdish M.E.  He is a nerd, as is Harry and the pound puppies, but he isn't goofy or as strange as he is portrayed.2.  The way that they did Bob was almost spot on, how else could you do him.  However he acts a bit as Harry's conscience, and  as we all know it's the other way around.3.  They missed Mac's Bar.4.  They only use his problems with technology when it suits them.5.  Justin is much more evil in the books.6.  I had a problem with his staff and wand.

I wish it had a chance to grow. There are many potentially good shows that never had a chance to go anywhere because they were cut after their first season (Firefly, Moonlight). It is especially upsetting when I see so much crap on TV that people seem to love. Husband and i recently cut the cable cord and we are happier watching reruns of good shows like this than anything on regular TV.Anyway, back to this show.. Like I said they made a lot of edits from the books, but this was still entertaining. Going through the character:Dresden - I like the way he is portrayed. They changed little aesthetic things about him but his essence is there. He drives a jeep instead of the VW, his staff is a drum stick, his coat is wrong but he plays the character well.Bob - Nothing at all like the book Bob but I like this version of Bob. I think making him a visible being is needed in TV land but the perverted Bob of the books is missed :) this is a good character.Murphy is a bit annoying, she seemed overly anti-Dresden. but Murphy in the books was not on Team Dresden fully for the first couple books either. She is a good demeanor for Murphy but with brown hair.Butters - in the show so little didn't really get a chance to make an opinionMorgan - really like him a lotSusan - also didn't really see her enough to make a full opinion but she is blond not brunette.I think as a Dresden fan there were a lot of changes that seemed silly, but as a TV show it was entertaining and would of liked to see more.

1077076,AB56DZ4IX5AIF,B000QUEQ4U,A. Young,"[0, 0]","The films of the TV series are based loosely on the books but are nonetheless compelling and fascinating viewing. The principal characters are all present in the TV series, although in some cases (such as Bob the spirit in the skull, Bianca the vampire and Old Mai) they are modified from their characters as they appear in the books.  Morgan is not bad.  He has the detestation of Harry perfectly acted, and yet is forced by his position on the White Council to give what can only be called unwilling assistance to Harry at various times.  Lieutenant Murphy is quite well done and she has the correct abrasive nature with Harry but still manages to show some respect and ""unwilling liking"" for him.  They work as a good team, just as they do in the books, even if there is abrasion all the time.It would be impossible for a 3/4hour long episode to create, in that time period, one of the 10 books published - so the movies take an aspect of the books that perhaps might be a chapter or several chapters, and make that into a full episode. Each episode is a complete story and they are very nicely rounded off.  It is very pleasing that the series does not descend into ""gory details"" very much at all.  You know a particularly horrific thing has happened and you can see the corpse, but you are thankfully not shown the blood and details which too often is used to ""sell"" movies these days.  The Dresden Files stands on its own merit and doesn't need anything more except its stories to help.If there is one flaw with the Zone 1 version I received from Amazon, it was that it was lacking in subtitles.  The PAL version available in Australia does have excellent subtitles and is much better for viewing by those with hearing impediments.  On the other hand, the Zone 1 version has a large amount of extra material about the making of the series which seems to be partially lacking in the Australian release.The dvd series is an excellent way to tempt a newcomer to read Jim Butcher's books and the dvd and book series complement each other very nicely because neither is exactly the same and the books are far more complex in their stories and overall structures.I highly recommend the Dresden Files disk as an exciting journey through the worlds of magic and fantasy and the only reason this review did not give 5 stars is the lack of subtitles on the disk.....But to a person with normal hearing, consider it a 5 star rating.

While not all episodes follow their book role-model, I find that it gives it somewhat new, fresh outlook on things. I'm especially happy with choice of lead actor who plays Harry Dresden himself - they couldn't of picked a better guy for the role (maybe a bit taller, but hey... ;) ).Go read the books (in order, please, you will enjoy it much better) and then get these DVDs and immerse yourself once more into the world of Harry Dresden, wizard for hire.",5,Excellent adaptation of awesome books!,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,816,"['Something', 'really', 'wrong', 'world', 'when', 'show', 'Dresden', 'files', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'Season', '1.I', 'grabbed', 'one', 'Jim', 'Butcher', 'books', 'library', 'pure', 'chance', 'got', 'hooked', 'up', 'instantly', 'Books', 'are', 'excellent', 'many', 'twists', 'popular', 'mythos', 'vampires', 'demons', 'dragons', 'etc', 'end', 'series', 'did', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'translating', 'new', 'media', 'not', 'episodes', 'follow', 'book', 'role-model', 'find', 'somewhat', 'new', 'fresh', 'outlook', 'things', ""'m"", 'especially', 'happy', 'choice', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'Harry', 'Dresden', 'could', ""n't"", 'picked', 'better', 'guy', 'role', 'maybe', 'bit', 'taller', 'hey', 'read', 'books', 'order', 'please', 'will', 'enjoy', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'get', 'DVDs', 'immerse', 'once', 'more', 'world', 'Harry', 'Dresden', 'wizard', 'hire']",The Dresden Files: Season 1

1077090,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,B000QUEQ4U,brainout,"[1, 1]","Okay, based on some of the reviews I made myself watch all of this deservedly-cancelled, season of Dresden Files.Why didn't it work?  First, it's trying to be a Charmed version of the popular Mickey Spillane Mike Hammer, only you don't know the Hammer angle until several episodes in, when the sexy-whisper (somewhat) witty voiceovers begin each episode.  That's a nice way to begin an episode, so why didn't they do it consistently?  Why didn't they take the third-to-the-last episode, and begin there?You coulda done the Greek drama thingy with that episode, making it begin the series; and from its voiceover beginning introducing Morgan et al., go back to what was MorningWay family, why important -- play on Morning Star, Satan's name pre-fall, since a star lights the way, cute -- then who the High Council was, etc.  So by the time you go full circle back to the present as all good Greek drama does, the viewer can say 'aha!' as the 'now' portion of the story (Moi and Morgan) unfolds.  Thus the viewer has an appreciation for the root characters.  You'd have to insert some flashbacks for establishing Murphy, but that's okay.  So at this point, that one episode is maybe 90 minutes, so becomes three episodes, establishing the series for the audience, getting them invested in the characters.THEN you could have started what is here called 'Episode 1', renamed 4.  The reader is clued in.  He now understands, and the wash rinse repeat part of each episode with ever more magic repeating as he's seen too many times, won't be boring.No, thoughtful introduction of the characters and style so you can IDENTIFY and CARE ABOUT the characters, wasn't desired.  After all, the lame Charmed series didn't bother to make you like the characters, but gave them wooden lines and script, so why not imitate that, in Dresden?Just hit on the magic over and over, always solving some case usually with someone out to get Dresden, wash rinse repeat.  That too, was the Charmed mantra.  And since Charmed kept on running, the mantra was wrongly assumed to be successful.Except, here the scripting and plotlines are not for teenyboppers.  Charmed only appeals to the not-quite adult set.  So to take the same wooden lines and then put them in a gritty Hammer context, just makes everything contrived.Now if A-flight actors were used, maybe the bad script could be overcome.  A Stellan Skaarsgard or even Nicholas Cage (who produced Dresden) might be able to pull off those lines, because someone of their caliber, is more important than the lines said.  We just like watching them act.  The teenyboppers just like the three lead girls in Charmed, so their wooden lines and plots and shallowness, all don't matter.But when you use lesser actors (not less in talent, but lower in recognition), then you had better make the script and storylines, A-level.  Alas, that doesn't happen here.  Instead, some dingdong imposed the same finish-story-in-one-episode rule that Warner imposed on Angel and Buffy, effectively killing both series.FOR IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS YOU WILL PAY ATTENTION TO LONG PLOTS.  And, you want them.  Just as in real life.  A short story can still be told on a lower level, but you need hanging threads to keep the audience coming back.  And they won't come back, if not invested in the characters.But the actors don't have the material to MAKE you become invested in the characters, if a) the script stinks, and b) there is no ongoing story line with lots of twists and added info per episode.  Buffy and Angel succeeded in large measure, not simply due to the chemistry between the lead characters (budding love story being always the long-term plot), but due to all the cast's stories, and you CARE about all the cast.  Many plots and subplots, many things to learn each episode, so you keep coming back.  Same, for Smallville and every other series.  Why do you think daytime soaps have such a loyal following?But did the script writer learn anything from the successful series which had been out ever since Bewitched (that followed the same complex ongoing plot rules)?  NO.  So what did the actors have to work with?  Flat dialogue, no character introduction and development, stereotypes, and wooden lines.  No backup long story except the all-too-predictable budding romance between Dresden and Murphy.  Who were forced to play two-dimensional stereotypes.  Since he's like Don Jones and she's like Stephanie Zimbalist, we weren't wholly disinterested.  But that's not enough, to be 'like', when you have no good storyline and no witty script to carry even one episode, to term.Direction and film editing are okay.  But you know:  the point of a series is to tell a LONG story, not wash rinse repeat.  The real story in a series is the long one, with each wash rinse repeat serving as a foil to unveil the pieces in the long story.  Just as in real life:  today you do the wash, tomorrow you go shopping, but what you LEARN each day is the real story of your life.We learn from Dresden, that the writer needs to be fired or given a long rehab in basic storytelling.  Or else, the producers need to revisit their intentions, versus execution.  And try again.This could have been a good series.  It can be, again.  REDO IT, please.",2,Mike Hammer Charmed?

1077102,AWO0Q404FVX04,B000QUEQ4U,"C. Fields ""Making your brain hurt since 2005.""","[22, 47]","First, let it be known that I own and have read ALL of the ""Dresden Files"" books. Now when I heard that quite possibly my favorite book series was being made into a TV show I was excited. Then I heard it was being made by Sci-Fi channel and I immediately had doubts. As it turns out those doubts were well founded. Sci-Fi channel took a great thing and turned it into another piece of primetime trash. But enough bashing Sci-Fi and their grave mistake that has made me lose what little confidence I had left in them.The TV show of ""Dresden Files"" has an innumerable amount of glaring problems. First and foremost they're with Harry, the sarcastic and ever cynical wizard-protagonist.First and foremost with Harry is that his wizarding gear has been dumbed down into the everyday. He carries a hockey stick with engraved runes as his staff and a drumstick as his blasting-rod. Seriously, how much worse can it get? Harry's trademark duster has been replaced by an almost mundane leather jacket. The unstoppable warhorse known by ""real"" fans of the ""Dresden Files"" as the Blue Beetle has been replaced by a 1940's era ARMY surplus Jeep.Second, Bob. Bob has been a source for hilarity since the beginning of the ""Storm Front"" novel. You don't get much more comedic than a sex-addicted air spirit living in a skull trading refuge from one of the Queens of the Sidhe for a repository of knowledge. He's the wizardly equivalent of a computer. In the TV series, Bob has been replaced by a former human wizard who appears occasionally talking in his stuck up English accent and fancy duds. Not a shred of the Bob that Jim Butcher readers have come to love.Third, some of the extra characters in the story. Murphy is completely different than who she is in the book. Not the short, cute, blone tough-chick cop we know and love. She's replaced by this brunette single mom trying to be tough in a man's world, with wizards. Anyone else see the problem? Morgan, Harry's would-be executioner and rival (for lack of a better term) in the novels is described as a man with an almost Will Riker-esque look. Now ""Affirmative Action"" replaced him with a minority-Morgan who makes people feel better about themselves by making Harry's life a living hell. Billy the Werewolf and the 'Alphas' are not to be heard of. Ancient Mai, who only makes 2 real appearences in the books, is the one who's trying to get Harry convicted of black magic and killed (and in coincidently a very unsavory character herself). That's just the tip of the iceberg.Fourth, I could go on and on about how watered down and bad the story is. However that would take up too much time and could probably provoke me into a rant.

I haven't had time to read the last three or four books in the series, but I loved all of the works prior to the aforementioned unread ones.  I had looked forward to watching the Sci-Fi TV series version, but couldn't watch it live and awaited the DVD with anticipation.  It sucks that the series was cancelled.  It is one of the best fantasy shows out there, and in spite of the predictable changes they made to the show, it was still enjoyable.  The special effects were better than most and the storylines were dark and entertaining.  Harry Dresden (Paul Blackthorne) is a bit cooler and darker than the book version -- kind of a supernatural James Bond.  (And why is his staff a hockey stick or a drumstick?)  But, like in the book, he has his fair share of inner demons and complexities, which made him an interesting character in this one as well.  Valerie Cruz does a good job as Murphy, Joanne Kelly is just how I pictured vampire Bianca to be, and Morgan (Conrad Coates) is pretty good too (though he wasn't black in the book).  I really like Terrence Mann as Bob.  In the series, he takes human form, whereas in the book he literally talks from a skull, but I can see that this change is necessary for the show.  Due to the show's abrupt cancellation, the show never reached its potential, and we didn't get to see other characters, like Michael and Thomas.  Sci-Fi should have given this one a chance.  It could have become a sleeper hit.  Alas, at least I get to keep this awesome DVD, and I still have the book series to enjoy.

I recommend both very highly.In case you don't know anything about the series, it is about the adventures of Harry Dresden, a wizard. Harry hires himself out as sort of a private detective for weird cases. It seems like the Chicago police are his main client - when they get a really weird case, they call him in.I think that most people will like the Harry character. He is a powerful wizard, but still a rather humble and all around nice guy. He has interesting friends as well, including Bob who lives in a skull (the ghost I think of a medieval wizard) and Murphy of the Chicago police (a lady cop and one tough cookie as they used to say).Give the DVD's a look and if you like them, try the books as well.Why this series was canceled I will never understand.

And there was Morgan, a Warden of the High Council, which is the governing body of the wizard community.For the price - less than $15, this is certainly worth the money.

Riffle ""TV dude""","[0, 0]","If you insist the books are the only iteration version of this concept, if you insist all TV should have the production budget and production values of major motion pictures, and if the book versions of the characters that you have visualized in your head are the only acceptable realizations, then this series isn't for you.On the other hand if you can relax and accept someone else's interpretation of this concept, if you can understand the need to create a new character for exposition in a television version of a book, and if you can be patient and allow some subtle development, you might be able to enjoy this television show.It's not great and the lack of budget shows here and there. But I do enjoy some light diversion once in a while and this show isn't terrible at that. To compare it to the books is going to lead to frustration in most devoted fans. On the other hand, what movie or TV show can come close to the depth, structure, and complexity of the book on which it's based. If you are a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, the movies are pretty lame and never come close to the experience of reading...and they cost millions and millions per movie. So, here we have Mr. Butler's stories mashed together and realized in a budget SyFy show. It's not perfect and it's not the best show ever, but it's at least it's fun and a decent diversion.On specific characters-- I applaud the use of Bob as a confidant who is constantly serving in an expository manner to help move the story along. The actor playing him is funny and this Bob adds a way to show Harry's conscience that we read about in his head in the books.I also applaud the new version of Morgan. In the books he is a stupid jerk who never seems to get any development. So to tighten up that aspect of the stories, Morgan is allowed to be intelligent and grow and appreciate Harry sometimes.I realize if you read the books, loved the books, and can't accept any other version of any of the characters or plot lines, then you're going to be annoyed by this TV version. I read the books, and like them. I watch the show and like it.Maybe someday the books will explode in popularity and then warrant a 200 million dollar movie--I hope so.

But i do know that i have enjoyed each and every episode on Sci Fi channel and now again with the First Season DVD set...kind of weird that's cancelled.  But it has First Season on the set...weird.  But i really enjoy the various characters in the show.  Harry Dresden with all the issues, drama and back story past that most wouldn't even believe.  Wizard for hire and detective as well neither are where he wants to be but, hey it pays ok and with all the weirdness: monsters, dragons, vampires, skinwalkers and various other weird as hell things that do more than bump in the night.  They body slam you to sleep.  I love his character because it's played with not with a sense of oh i'm important.  It's more like i'm a wizard...dang it isnt there anything else.  But he accepts it and goes out to protect those in of protecting..big city and all that.I also like Bob and what he brings as well being someone without a body for having raised someone that he loved from the dead.  It got him a nice little one way trip to the neighbor skull where he resides and comes out whenever Harry needs him...many times when he doesn't.  I just enjoy his character and how knowledgable he is and is always there helping out Harry even when we think he isn't like (in one episode).  Also Murphy who at first doesnt want to hear anything Harry has to say about the weirdness going on.  She doesnt want to be bothered with it...to weird and all that.  But as the season progresses she believes a bit more with each occurence and several that happen to her that kind of force her to see.  Dresden isn't some no talent hack out there exploiting people's fears weird crap is going and i need to be down with the guy that can help me solve some of this madness.I also enjoyed the other actors/actresses in the series as well.  The guests were cool as well such as Claudia Black.  I can't help but think what could've and should've been for this series...yet again another series that i find myself getting attached to and loving, wanting to see each week getting cancelled..yet again (ratings anyone).  I'm just glad that i have this on DVD and hope that by some miracle the Dresden Files is renewed by another network if possible.  I would love to see this go and progress into something outstanding.Features on last disc include commentary on ""Things That Go Bump"" and a making of Featurette which is interesting in of itself.

1077135,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000QUEQ4U,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[125, 134]","Imagine if Harry Potter grew up to be Philip Marlowe, and you'll have a pretty good idea of what ""The Dresden Files"" is like.While it starts weakly -- and is rarely faithful to Jim Butcher's novels -- ""The Dresden Files"" manages to whip itself into a solid supernatural-mystery series, with a pretty good cast and some genuinely twisty-turny mysteries. And, of course, a snarky ghost living inside a skull.Harry Dresden (Paul Blackthorne) is Chicago's only wizard-for-hire, with a tragic past, a hockey-stick staff, and a companion spirit named Bob who lives in a skull (Terrence Mann). He's also perpetually in bad with the wizard council, and moderately famous among the supernatural crowds lurking around Chicago.As the series opens, Harry is approached by a young boy who claims he's being stalked by otherworldly forces -- and his mother confirms that he's been followed by blackbirds, crows and ravens ever since he was born. Even worse, a skinned body is found in a nearby apartment -- and the malevolent skinwalker who stole the woman's dermis may be after the boy as well.Arguably the premiere is the weakest of the series, since there's little actual detecting going on. But things perk up in the following episodes. Harry tackles a hellspawn in love, a serial killer murdering werewolves, a bodysnatching murderer, a fertility clinic with a dark secret, a bunch of young thieves using deadly magic, and an attempt to frame Bianca, the sultry vampire club-owner.Things get even worse when Harry is trapped with a bunch of hostile wizards inside a deadly cloud, which can only have been conjured by one of them. And when Bob is stolen, Harry finds himself confronting his cruel uncle Justin -- whom Harry ""self-defensed to death"" five years ago.""The Dresden Files"" are only loosely based on the Jim Butcher novels -- it's not as dark or as complex, and a lot of characters are changes. But take it as its own animal, and it ends up being a very solid detective series... albeit one where the suspects and victims just happen to be vampires, devils, lycanthropes, incubi and necromancers.The plots are genuinely mysterious and gritty, sometimes with genuinely surprising answers, and odd twists on typical urban-fantasy, like vampire junkies. The stories are kept from being too grim by Bob, who provides some witty dialogue to offset the cop-style stuff (""And you wonder why your life is an unending series of insurmountable intellectual, financial and emotional hurdles!"").If the series has a problem, it's that sometimes they overuse the handheld camera, especially in fight scenes. And the CGI ranges from decent (Bianca's vampire transformations) to somewhat hokey (dragon, werewolves), but not bad considering.Blackthorne is just right for the role: quirky, likable, and a little bit charming.

They didn't but it takes a little time to settle in to the show if you're familiar with the books because of the differences.The basic idea is that Harry Dresden, named for the magician Houdini not the 'boy who lived,' is the only wizard in the Chicago yellow pages. He deals in things lost and unexplained problems and is called in on police cases that are about to go in the 'little green man' file.Dresden is a wise cracking, somewhat shabby looking fellow, who would be quite at home hanging out with litterary detective like Philo Vance and Nick Charles.For a more adult look at a world similar to Buffy's this is what you want. There are only two real problems with it. (1) The DVD's seem really lacking in extras. (2) If you're familiar with the books, this gets in the way of the TV show as you see where some of the book plots were borrowed, but don't quite marry up and the cast of supporting characters is markedly different. This would not be so bad if it wasn't that they drift close to the book characters, and miss.

I like noir-ish detective stuff and fantasy fiction. This show crossed them both perfectly and offered an interesting new story with every episode. So what do the execs at the Sci-Fi Channel do? They cancel it. And it's not because the rating were low either. It was because they were not reaching the correct demographic. What IS the correct demographic exactly?The show revolves around a wizard named Harry...Dresden; a Chicago-based Private Eye. He helps out the police with their bizarre, head-scratching cases without ever revealing his powers. Armed with a hockey stick sceptre and a drumstick wand, his methods occasionally rouse The High Council, the magical governors who are always weary of Harry since he used Black Magic to kill his uncle.It can be accused to ripping-off anything from CSI, Buffy, Charmed or even Law & Order, but I think that The Dresden Files stood well on its own two feet. The cold, wintry (often Xmasy) feel to the show and the naturalised look sits well with the supernatural element and there is a dynamic range of characters. Though my favorite has to be Bob (Hrothbert of Bainbridge), the ghost of a gentlemanly wizard cursed to live the rest of eternity inside his own skull when he's not helping Harry with his latest case. He's played by Terrance Mann, who you may remember as Johnny Steele, singing 'Power of the Night' in the original Critters movie.I am sad that The Dresden Files never made it past a single series.

I watched the first show of this series, eager in my hopes for it because Jim Butcher had put so much hope on it as well.I was very disappointed.Sure, books and movies/shows are not the same.  Heck, I wasn't excepting that they would do any of the books straight over as plots for the series -- actually I was kind of hoping against it.  Be that as may be, I was appalled, as a lover of the books, at what I saw.Harry is fine.  Murph ... is wrong.  She is not cute-n-tough, but just tough (and when did a child come in to the picture for her?).  Bob bothered me at first for showing up ... but that wore off and then I got annoyed because he was nothing like Bob!  Where were all the wisecracks?  Where were the demands for romance novels and the havoc he wrecked upon sorority houses?  Where was his wisdom?And then there was Morgan...Instead of being a rather thick, battle-hardened, utterly-by-the-books, tough as nails guy with a huge sword, he was a suave, sophisticated politico.No, beyond Harry, none of the characters felt right to me.  The plots were often nonsensical, but this can be chalked up to massive last-minute re-editing (bad move, studio!).  The connection with the books was so weak as to be demoralizing.So the show never found an audience and, despite being underbudget, SciFi decided to can the series in favour of Flash Gordon before the show had a chance to build an audience of its own.So, The Dresden Files is gone.Rest in peace.",2,"Loved the novels, disappointed with the show",1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,1780,"['Now', 'show', 'officially', 'cancelled', '08/03/07', 'time', 'put', 'wrap', 'matters.I', 'really', 'loved', 'first', 'four', 'Harry', 'Dresden', 'books', 'have', 'grown', 'less', 'enamoured', 'later', 'volumes', 'most', 'recent', 'one', 'gotten', 'back', 'roots', 'less', 'Saving', 'World', 'more', 'acting', 'detective', 'magic', 'watched', 'first', 'show', 'series', 'eager', 'hopes', 'Jim', 'Butcher', 'had', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'hope', 'well.I', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed.Sure', 'books', 'movies/shows', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'Heck', 'was', ""n't"", 'excepting', 'would', 'do', 'books', 'straight', 'plots', 'series', 'actually', 'was', 'kind', 'hoping', 'Be', 'as', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'appalled', 'lover', 'books', 'what', 'saw.Harry', 'fine', 'Murph', 'wrong', 'not', 'cute-n-tough', 'just', 'tough', 'when', 'did', 'child', 'come', 'picture', 'Bob', 'bothered', 'first', 'showing', 'up', 'wore', 'off', 'then', 'got', 'annoyed', 'was', 'nothing', 'Bob', 'Where', 'were', 'wisecracks', 'Where', 'were', 'demands', 'romance', 'novels', 'havoc', 'wrecked', 'sorority', 'houses', 'Where', 'was', 'wisdom', 'then', 'was', 'Morgan', 'Instead', 'being', 'rather', 'thick', 'battle-hardened', 'utterly-by-the-books', 'tough', 'nails', 'guy', 'huge', 'sword', 'was', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'politico.No', 'Harry', 'none', 'characters', 'felt', 'right', 'plots', 'were', 'often', 'nonsensical', 'can', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'massive', 'last-minute', 're-editing', 'bad', 'move', 'studio', 'connection', 'books', 'was', 'so', 'weak', 'be', 'demoralizing.So', 'show', 'never', 'found', 'audience', 'being', 'underbudget', 'SciFi', 'decided', 'can', 'series', 'favour', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'show', 'had', 'chance', 'build', 'audience', 'own.So', 'Dresden', 'Files', 'gone.Rest', 'peace']",The Dresden Files: Season 1

What the hell viewer would stick around long enough to watch a series grow legs, especially if he was already familiar with the much better crafted bops by Jim Butcher?Harry is a born and well-trained wizard (the latter only hinted at in the series) who assists the Chicago Police department on cases that smack of the unexplainable, while also grabbing private detective-type cases involving magic.  Based on the immensely successful series of novels by Mr. Butcher, whoever designed this series did an absolutely terrible job.  The viewer will never get to know Harry well enough to care whether or not he is gobbled up by demons; the structure of the series wanders all over the globe without any sense of style; Harry is played as an awkward, largely incompetent nincompoop who only occasionally seems to know what the hell to do with his magic.When the episodes are good, they're very good; these, coincidentally or not, do not seem to be the stories written by the series' producers.  They intrigued me enough to purchase the first book of the series, and I really enjoyed it, thus ordered the rest.  So where did the translation from novel to television go wrong?  Answer:  everywhere.Paul Blackthorne gives a credible performance, although to me, he wasn't attractive enough for me to love him just because he got the job.  The supporting cast is all good, although I will never understand why networks and producers alter characters for no good reason.  Murph plays great as a non-blond, tough-edged policewoman; Bob is great as a handsome and not-quite-so-lecherous ghost who regularly escapes the skull that has entrapped him for millennia; Morgan the Harry-hitman for the Magical Council is interesting as an African American.  But why did these characters have to vary so much from the book?  Couldn't you producers honor the original designs that you bought to begin with?  Is this purely an ego trip?  Why don't you adapt the Bible, and change everybody in it to dancing monkeys (actually, that might be an improvement)?In fairness, by the time the series ended, in addition to wishing it had been better, I was sorry I'd never see more.  That's why I'm reading the books.",2,"Jim Butcher, kick these people's asses",1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,2413,"['am', 'great', 'fan', 'supernatural', 'bought', 'series', 'only', 'discover', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'start', 'about', 'episode', 'three', 'time', 'proverbial', 'Sword', 'Damacles', 'had', 'probably', 'already', 'fallen', 'What', 'hell', 'viewer', 'would', 'stick', 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'watch', 'series', 'grow', 'legs', 'especially', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'much', 'better', 'crafted', 'bops', 'Jim', 'Butcher', 'Harry', 'born', 'well-trained', 'wizard', 'latter', 'only', 'hinted', 'series', 'who', 'Chicago', 'Police', 'department', 'cases', 'smack', 'unexplainable', 'also', 'grabbing', 'private', 'detective-type', 'cases', 'involving', 'magic', 'Based', 'immensely', 'successful', 'series', 'novels', 'Mr.', 'Butcher', 'whoever', 'designed', 'series', 'did', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'job', 'viewer', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'Harry', 'well', 'enough', 'care', 'not', 'gobbled', 'up', 'demons', 'structure', 'series', 'wanders', 'globe', 'sense', 'style', 'Harry', 'played', 'awkward', 'largely', 'incompetent', 'nincompoop', 'who', 'only', 'occasionally', 'know', 'what', 'hell', 'do', 'magic.When', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', ""'re"", 'very', 'good', 'coincidentally', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'stories', 'written', 'series', 'producers', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'purchase', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'thus', 'ordered', 'rest', 'where', 'did', 'translation', 'novel', 'television', 'go', 'wrong', 'Answer', 'everywhere.Paul', 'Blackthorne', 'credible', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'attractive', 'enough', 'love', 'just', 'got', 'job', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'networks', 'producers', 'alter', 'characters', 'good', 'reason', 'Murph', 'great', 'non-blond', 'tough-edged', 'policewoman', 'Bob', 'great', 'handsome', 'not-quite-so-lecherous', 'ghost', 'who', 'regularly', 'skull', 'entrapped', 'millennia', 'Morgan', 'Harry-hitman', 'Magical', 'Council', 'interesting', 'African', 'American', 'why', 'did', 'characters', 'have', 'vary', 'so', 'much', 'book', 'Could', ""n't"", 'producers', 'honor', 'original', 'designs', 'bought', 'begin', 'purely', 'ego', 'trip', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'adapt', 'Bible', 'change', 'everybody', 'dancing', 'monkeys', 'actually', 'might', 'be', 'improvement', 'fairness', 'time', 'series', 'ended', 'addition', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'sorry', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'more', 'why', ""'m"", 'reading', 'books']",The Dresden Files: Season 1

My prayers were answered by the Scifi network with this awesome show.I was already a fan of the book series and this show does an excellent job of adapting the stories written by Jim Butcher.  Like in Charmed, magic exists but regular people don't know about it.  Harry Dresden is the only Wizard P.I. in the phone book.  Most think he's a crack pot, but some know he is their only hope.  He works as a consultant to the police via Det. Murphy on those cases considered bizarre.  Along the way there are werewolf serial killers, vampire club owners, and innocents that need to be protected.The show doesn't overdo the special effects, rather using them less frequently but with greater impact.  Which is actually in keeping with the books.  Harry is faithfully recreated and played by Paul Blackstone.  And then there is Bob.  The portrayal of Bob is one of those rare instances where a book character has been drastically changed, but in a good way.  In the books he is an incorporeal spirit residing in a skull.  This is fine in the books where a reader's imagination is boosting the concept, but would not translate well to TV.  Producers cleverly decided to make him a human-looking ghost with a dry wit and snappy dialog.

1077182,A2AWDN78GY6WNM,B000QUEQ4U,Jerry Larson,"[1, 1]","Despite my low expectations of any new Sci-Fi Channel series, I watched a couple of episodes of ""Dresden Files"" when it was on in 2007, thought it was pretty good, and that's how I found out about the novels, of which I became a huge fan.My recollection of the TV series was that it wasn't too bad, maybe rose to the level of pretty good, but when I found out it was on Amazon Prime, and went back and watched the whole series, I found out I was wrong.  It's not pretty good.It's excellent!If you happen to be a fan of the novels, you have to accept that this is not the novels; it's a different adaptation of the Harry Dresden canon.  Most, or maybe all, of the episodes are based on, or at least share ideas with, the early novels, and some things are the same, but some are different.  That's how it is.  Jim Butcher himself said that it's to be considered an alternate reality, and if you expect the TV series to be the same as the novels, you'll be disappointed.  I struggled with it a little bit myself.  I can accept that there are reasons for most of the differences; I can see why Murphy is different, why Bob manifests with a human appearance, etc.  I can't see why they had to change Murphy's first name, or turn the Blue Beetle into this stupid jeep, but whatever.  You have to get past that to appreciate the TV series.  That said, it is the same character, by the same author, and in essential ways it's faithful to the spirit of the Dresden stories.If you haven't read the novels, I'd say best thing is to watch this series first and enjoy it for what it is, then look into the novels.  If you have read the novels, you have to have a talk with yourself and make it clear to yourself that this series is related to the novels, but it's not them, and don't expect everything to be the same.  If you can do that, it's very enjoyable.The casting, acting and direction are superb, and so is the writing.  It's really good TV.  The special effects are pretty weak for the 21st century; I guess they didn't have the budget.  Some of the sets are gorgeous, though-- Harry's place, his uncle's mansion.  I'm talking about the series as a whole; I found the first episode, ""Birds of a Feather"", rather weak, though it does get the job done in terms of setting up the characters, setting, and premise.  The scary monsters just aren't scary enough, though.If you watch the episodes in order of appearance, it gets better and better.  The last two in particular are outstanding.I don't know why it wasn't continued; partly, I'm sure, it's just because the SciFi Channel, or Squiffy or whatever they call themselves now, has no taste and always cancels the best shows, e.g. Farscape.  Perhaps, it didn't catch on with enough viewers-- but as someone else pointed out, they kept showing it at weird times, which is one of the things they do when they want to kill a show.Actually I'm not sure that the  TV series could have developed the way the novels have.  It certainly would take a bigger budget; you'd need a huge cast before you got very far, and lots of CGI.  This is the Harry of the early novels, just scraping by, not the powerful wizard that Harry becomes in the later novels.  The characters were already developing in different directions; for example, Harry and Morgan, Harry and Murphy, work together pretty well by the end of the 12 episodes, long before they got to that point in the novels.  Anyway, this is what it is.  Approach it with an open mind, and I think you'll be pleased.",5,Love it for what it is,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,3501,"['low', 'expectations', 'new', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'series', 'watched', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Dresden', 'Files', 'when', 'was', '2007', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'how', 'found', 'out', 'novels', 'became', 'huge', 'fan.My', 'recollection', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'maybe', 'rose', 'level', 'pretty', 'good', 'when', 'found', 'was', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'wrong', 'not', 'pretty', 'good.It', 'excellent', 'happen', 'be', 'fan', 'novels', 'have', 'accept', 'not', 'novels', 'different', 'adaptation', 'Harry', 'Dresden', 'canon', 'Most', 'maybe', 'episodes', 'are', 'based', 'least', 'share', 'ideas', 'early', 'novels', 'things', 'are', 'same', 'are', 'different', 'how', 'Jim', 'Butcher', 'said', 'be', 'considered', 'alternate', 'reality', 'expect', 'TV', 'series', 'be', 'same', 'novels', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'struggled', 'little', 'bit', 'can', 'accept', 'are', 'reasons', 'most', 'differences', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Murphy', 'different', 'why', 'Bob', 'human', 'appearance', 'etc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'had', 'change', 'Murphy', 'first', 'name', 'turn', 'Blue', 'Beetle', 'stupid', 'jeep', 'whatever', 'have', 'get', 'past', 'appreciate', 'TV', 'series', 'said', 'same', 'character', 'same', 'author', 'essential', 'ways', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'Dresden', 'stories.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novels', ""'d"", 'say', 'best', 'thing', 'watch', 'series', 'first', 'enjoy', 'what', 'then', 'look', 'novels', 'have', 'read', 'novels', 'have', 'have', 'talk', 'yourself', 'make', 'clear', 'yourself', 'series', 'related', 'novels', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'everything', 'be', 'same', 'can', 'do', 'very', 'enjoyable.The', 'casting', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'superb', 'so', 'writing', 'really', 'good', 'TV', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'weak', '21st', 'century', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', 'sets', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'though', 'Harry', 'place', 'uncle', 'mansion', ""'m"", 'talking', 'series', 'whole', 'found', 'first', 'episode', 'Birds', 'Feather', 'rather', 'weak', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'terms', 'setting', 'up', 'characters', 'setting', 'premise', 'scary', 'monsters', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', 'enough', 'though.If', 'watch', 'episodes', 'order', 'appearance', 'better', 'better', 'last', 'two', 'particular', 'are', 'outstanding.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'continued', 'partly', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'Squiffy', 'call', 'now', 'taste', 'always', 'cancels', 'best', 'shows', 'e.g', 'Farscape', 'Perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'enough', 'viewers', 'someone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'kept', 'showing', 'weird', 'times', 'one', 'things', 'do', 'when', 'want', 'kill', 'show.Actually', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'TV', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'way', 'novels', 'have', 'certainly', 'would', 'take', 'bigger', 'budget', ""'d"", 'need', 'huge', 'cast', 'got', 'very', 'far', 'lots', 'CGI', 'Harry', 'early', 'novels', 'just', 'scraping', 'not', 'powerful', 'wizard', 'Harry', 'later', 'novels', 'characters', 'were', 'already', 'developing', 'different', 'directions', 'example', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Harry', 'Murphy', 'work', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'end', '12', 'episodes', 'long', 'got', 'point', 'novels', 'Anyway', 'what', 'Approach', 'open', 'mind', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased']",The Dresden Files: Season 1

The first few episodes were just a little slow but interesting and certainly good enough to tempt me to watch more.  As the season went on, however, the writing and acting seemed to improve with every episode until the show ranked up there as a ""must see"" for me on a weekly basis.When the season ended, I missed the show so much I picked up copies of all of the books by Jim Butcher and read them in order over the course of two weeks.  They were that enjoyable.What's really surprising is that the show and the books are both excellent, yet really very different.  I have to say that the books are definitely better - they are very involved with each novel being a self contained ""case"" in the files of Harry Dresden and also advancing the central overarching plots of the series.  They are very addictive and enjoyable - well written pulp fiction with a science fiction/mystery/fantasy bent.Still the show stands up very well on its own.  It's definitely more episodic with less emphasis on the growth of the characters and central plot themes, which is due to the limitations of the shows being 44 minute self contained stories.  The characters, from Bob to Murphy to Bianca to Dresden himself are all significantly different than the characters in the books.  And remarkably this works well for the show.My suggestion would be to watch the series OR read the books, then take a short break and go back and enjoy whichever medium you didn't choose during the first go-around.

So when I first heard of The Dresden Files TV show, I thought, ""I'll pass.""When I bought a new iPod and visited the iTunes store to see what I could download, I saw The Dresden Files. This time I thought, ""It's only $1.99 for the first episode. Why not?""I watched it in bed one night, my little ear buds in and the iPod screen about six inches from my face. I was mesmerized. Something about the show really clicked with me.The next morning I told my wife about it. ""I know you're going to think I'm nuts, but I really liked The Dresden Files. I watched and episode last night. It was compelling and well acted. It had an air of magic about it, and not because it's a show about a wizard who has a shop in Chicago.""We found The Dresden Files DVD set at a local store and bought it.For the last couple of weeks, we've watched an episode a night, totally engrossed. Completely hooked.We haven't seen a show this well done in many years. It's on par with LOST for its believable, smart, witty characters. It's on par with Buffy the Vampire Slayer for its otherworldly milieu.Everything about the show, from its setting in Chicago (actually filmed in Toronto, but it looks like Chicago, one of my favorite cities) to its hapless lead character, a wizard named Harry Dresden, to its cast of fascinating supporting characters (Bob, the ghost who lives in his skull, Murphy, the attractive but smart police woman, and many others) is first-rate. This is an extraordinary television series.Which can only mean one thing: It got canceled.Apparently, the morons at the Sci-Fi Channel didn't pick up the series for a second season. I'm not even sure it was given the chance to have a complete first season since there are only 12 episodes in this DVD set. Why a network wouldn't want a show this exceptional is beyond me.But The Dresden Files is in very good company. Consider Firefly, the brilliant sci-fi Western created by Joss Whedon. FOX was the moronic network that time, dropping it after less than 14 episodes. or consider Carnivale, the jaw-dropping series axed by HBO after two seasons.I've never figured out why networks are so stupid. They complain ad revenues are down, along with viewership. Yet, they cancel the shows that are the most well done and best loved. It makes no sense at all. I wish I could be in charge of a network, just for a week. I wouldn't ax any shows. I'd ax the axers, get rid of every MBA bean-counting suit who wouldn't know a well-made show if it drove up next to his Bimmer at a stop light.Anyway, The Dresden Files is superb. The dialog is witty. The characters are the most ""real"" and believable I've ever seen in a TV series. And the stories are compelling.I can't recommend The Dresden Files highly enough.

1077196,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B000QUEQ4U,Justin G.,"[25, 34]","I wanted to love this series. I really did. I'm a fan of the Dresden Files books, and was hoping the Sci-Fi Channel series would become one of those cult hits like Buffy or the X-Files. Unfortunately the series never lived up to its potential, and therefore never became a hit.The premise of the series was simple enough. Harry Dresden is an openly practicing Wizard - sort of a P.I. of the paranormal. Unfortunately the paranormal aspects were downplayed in favor of straight investigation and police work, making me wonder why I shouldn't just watch Law & Order instead. The series benefited from solid performances by Paul Blackthorne and Valerie Cruz (as Harry and Lt. Karen Murphy, respectively), but suffered from poor special effects and mostly forgettable stories.Not surprisingly, the only episode that really impressed me was the one based on the novelStorm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1). That episode (was it the pilot?) was the one that relied heaviest on magic and the supernatural. It also had better than average effects and stayed truest to Jim Butcher's stories. The rest of the series follow the novels in a vague sense, but take a lot of liberties, not all of which are bad. I could get past the fact that neither Harry nor Karen were exactly as the books depicted them. Heck, I'll probably be picturing these actors next time I read a Dresden novel. I didn't even mind the Jeep or the fact that Bob (well played by Terrance Mann) had a human presence. And I loved the idea of using hockey sticks and drumsticks as weapons and wands. What I couldn't get over was the fact that magic played such a minor role in the series, when it was the very thing that would have made it stand out.The Dresden Files was a fun but flawed series that never really found its footing.

I love Jim Butcher's novels and Harry Dresden.  While not an exact adaptation of Butcher's well-beloved series, THE DRESDEN FILES - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON are still a lot of fun and well worth watching.I have always thought of this series as a kind of Harry Potter meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Charmed meets X-Files meets Sam Spade.  And somehow, that weird and wonderful combination just works.  These shows have great atmosphere.  The cinematography is clearly inspired by 1940s film noire.  The colors are just muted enough to send you back in time to that era.  The acting is great.  Paul Blackthorne is an inspired choice to play our favorite wizard, Harry.  Rough around the edges, sarcastic humor, tongue-in-cheek wit, world-weary voice, always fighting for the underdog, Blackthorne captures Harry to a tee.  Now, whenever I read the books, I hear Blackthorne's voice in my head.  That is a good thing.  Terrence Mann is first-rate as Bob, the skull in Harry's basement.  Mann is another excellent choice, as put upon and droll as Butcher wrote.  But here, Bob's spirit can manifest outside of the skull, which is good for us.  We get to really see the interactions and the bond between Harry and Bob.  This is a definite plus, dare I say an improvement from the books.  Something like an animated skull would not have worked nearly as well.  The rest of the cast are equally good, committed to their roles and to the series.  They make it all work, and add to the audience's enjoyment of these shows.The plots are loosely based on different excerpts from various early Dresden books.

1077205,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000QUEQ4U,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 2]","Is my opinion of this TV series skewed because I read the first three novels before approaching the DVD?  Maybe.  But I think, if I encountered this series cold, I would have been just as disappointed.  It aims low, has remarkably little respect for the audience, and has no ambition.  Regular science fiction, fantasy, and mystery audiences are likely to be justly disappointed.That said, if you want to enjoy this series, let me give you a step-by-step guide to the process.  Step one is to put aside anything you know about the novels.  This series borrows character names and a handful of core concepts, but it is essentially a wholly separate beast.  If you can clear the novels from your head, you might have a chance of liking this.  A small chance.Step two is to have modest expectations.  One trait I have enjoyed in the Dresden novels is the epic scope, which is a rare characteristic in recent paperback fiction.  The novels seem huge, but these episodes seem small.  So if you come in looking for heroic grandeur you will be frustrated, but if you can simply appreciate the story in small nuggets, maybe you'll like this.Step three, watch selectively.  Toward the end of the series, you'll find two episodes, ""Things That Go Bump"" and ""What About Bob,"" that are actually quite good, if inconsistent with the novels.  It seems that, as the series was running out, the creative team found their courage and began making episodes that respect the audience's ambition.  Too bad it was already too late.Step four, go easy on the actors.  Terrance Mann's fake British accent is good, but he plays a dead Englander as an immobile starched shirt.  Paul Blackthorne's fake American accent sounds like he's working lines with a mouth full of quick-drying cement.  I really enjoyed Valerie Cruz as Murphy, but she was criminally underutilized, which I felt was an insult to the audience.My fifth and final step is to simply put aside all critical knowledge of TV.  If you take on this show as an attempt to create the Hill Street Blues of fantasy, you're in for a disappointment.  If you can just watch the show as is, maybe you'll be transported by its serviceable special effects and workmanlike acting.  Or maybe you won't, I don't know.",2,Step By Step,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,2241,"['opinion', 'TV', 'series', 'skewed', 'read', 'first', 'three', 'novels', 'approaching', 'DVD', 'Maybe', 'think', 'encountered', 'series', 'cold', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'disappointed', 'low', 'remarkably', 'little', 'respect', 'audience', 'ambition', 'Regular', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'mystery', 'audiences', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'justly', 'disappointed.That', 'said', 'want', 'enjoy', 'series', 'let', 'give', 'step-by-step', 'guide', 'process', 'Step', 'one', 'put', 'aside', 'anything', 'know', 'novels', 'series', 'character', 'names', 'handful', 'core', 'concepts', 'essentially', 'wholly', 'separate', 'beast', 'can', 'clear', 'novels', 'head', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'liking', 'small', 'chance.Step', 'two', 'have', 'modest', 'expectations', 'One', 'trait', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Dresden', 'novels', 'epic', 'scope', 'rare', 'characteristic', 'recent', 'paperback', 'fiction', 'novels', 'seem', 'huge', 'episodes', 'seem', 'small', 'So', 'come', 'looking', 'heroic', 'grandeur', 'will', 'be', 'frustrated', 'can', 'simply', 'appreciate', 'story', 'small', 'nuggets', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'like', 'this.Step', 'three', 'watch', 'selectively', 'end', 'series', ""'ll"", 'find', 'two', 'episodes', 'Things', 'Go', 'Bump', 'What', 'Bob', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'inconsistent', 'novels', 'that', 'series', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'creative', 'team', 'found', 'courage', 'began', 'making', 'episodes', 'respect', 'audience', 'ambition', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', 'already', 'too', 'late.Step', 'four', 'go', 'easy', 'actors', 'Terrance', 'Mann', 'fake', 'British', 'accent', 'good', 'dead', 'Englander', 'immobile', 'starched', 'shirt', 'Paul', 'Blackthorne', 'fake', 'American', 'accent', 'sounds', 'working', 'lines', 'mouth', 'full', 'quick-drying', 'cement', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Valerie', 'Cruz', 'Murphy', 'was', 'criminally', 'underutilized', 'felt', 'was', 'insult', 'audience.My', 'fifth', 'final', 'step', 'simply', 'put', 'aside', 'critical', 'knowledge', 'TV', 'take', 'show', 'attempt', 'create', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'fantasy', ""'re"", 'disappointment', 'can', 'just', 'watch', 'show', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'transported', 'serviceable', 'special', 'effects', 'workmanlike', 'acting', 'maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'know']",The Dresden Files: Season 1

Sozaeva ""Obsessive bibliophile""","[5, 5]","""The Dresden Files"" is not, for those interested, a direct translation of Jim Butcher's books into a television series.  Rather, the characters and ideas of the Harry Dresden, Wizard for Hire books have been taken and - in my opinion - brilliantly used as background to create mostly completely new stories for the television series.  (The only ones I noted that were closely related to any books were the werewolf episode and the skinwalker episode, and even those were only loosely based on the original books).  There are a great many changes made in order to make the series more ""watchable,"" I suppose - it has already been mentioned that Bob is given a ghostly body, and I absolutely LOVE what they have done with him. The actor playing Bob - Terrence Mann - is a brilliant actor and brings charm and class to the role.  Harry, alas, does not drive the Blue Beetle, although in one episode we see him working on it.  Rather he drives a dilapidated old Jeep.  Also, rather than having a snazzy staff and blasting rod, he carries around a hockey stick and a drum stick for a wand - I thought this was even weirder than carrying a staff, if you ask me.  A cane would have been better, but *shrug*  Michael is conspicuously absent from the cast of characters, which absence I felt most keenly.  HOWEVER, all that said, I still enjoyed this show immensely and felt that the scriptwriters and producers did Jim Butcher's creation proud.  Paul Blackthorne is a perfect Harry Dresden - scruffy yet charismatic, charming yet somehow seeming to be bumbling along all the time.  We don't see a lot of overt magic, nor lots of special effects, but what we do see is very neat and well done - the episode ""Things that go Bump"" is especially good, with all the neat glowing runes all over the wall, the green fire - the dragon!  Awesome stuff.I noticed in one of the one-star reviews that there is a rumor this show is not going to be renewed for a second season.  I sure hope that is NOT the case, as I feel this show has a great deal of potential.  I have talked with other people around who are also fans of this show - it seems to have quite a following and I believe it would be sorely missed if it were cut off so quickly.  I would hate to see this become another ""Brimstone"" - another terrific show with a great premise cut off in its prime before it had a chance to grow.

Shortly thereafter, I bought the DVDs of the first (and, sadly, the only) season on Amazon. The casting of Harry's and Murphy's characters was inspired; Paul Blackthorne is a genuinely likable Harry, and Valerie Cruz is a fresh rendition of the gutsy-yet-vulnerably human police inspector. The special effects were well-balanced between vivid imagery and believability, not overdone or unduly burdened with ""production values"" as is so often the case with this video genre. The decision on the part of the tele-playwrites to diverge from the book series' plot lines was a wise move and didn't violate the spirit of the original characters' portrayals in the print series.I must confess that I only read the Harry Dresden books AFTER viewing the TV series on Netflix. THAT may account for my disappointment with the print version, which I found to be long-winded and over-written, given the time span of the plot lines and the short arc of the action of each story. BTW: I am not shy about reading LONG, INTROSPECTIVE mysteries; it's just that the word count should justify my time spent.The termination of THE DRESDEN FILES series after only one season is a testimony to the lack of target-audience insight and the inability to recognize quality entertainment product on the part of the network's programming directors and other top decision-makers.

Emery,"[3, 4]","First, I want to point a ""shame on you"" finger at the 1 star reviews who's reason for the single star is simply that the series has differences from the book. With all due respect, grow up! You name ONE book made into a series that DOESN'T have differences in it!(I might get a slew of ""did not help"" votes from those people for saying that. Eh, not too concerned.)The series should be judged as a series, not how it compares to the books.The Characters:Harry Dresden comes off as very likeable and naturally funny. A wizard listed in the phone book, yet reluctant hero. He can pull off some pretty nice magic when he wants, yet is conservative and careful as to when he will use it or not.The actor playing him, Paul Blackthorne, does a fine acting job, a very believable performance.Lt. Connie Murphy is an...ok...character, in my opinion. She's a touch single divorcee, mother, and indluges Dresden's more magical aspects even though she doesn't believe in magic herself. The only real negatives that I have about her is:A)She has no believable chemistry with Dresden, in my opinion, so the eventual hint of her attraction toward him feels weird.B)The episodes are more enjoyable when it's just Dresden and she's only in a limited number of scenes.Hrothbert ""Bob"" of Bainbridge is an amusing character, the obvious comic relief character. However...The actor playing him though does a horrible accent, and his acting seems better suited for a stage play than a TV series...very overly dramatic delivery and body movements; too much too often, in my opinion.Warden Donald Morgan, a Warden of the High Council (kind of the police, for wizards and supernatural beings) is pretty good, mostly serious but just enough charisma to be a likeable character. I like the banter between him and Dresden when there is a difference of opinion, based not only on Morgan being a stickler for the rules but also because he and Dresden have different personalities.The Writing:The writing seems tamer than it probably should be, though it was good enough that I stuck with the series all through it's original television run. I liked that they didn't rely on a bunch of flashy magic scenes, focusing more on character interaction and devlopment. The writing kind of reminded me of Doctor Who, in that it was safe for kids to watch, for the most part.Personally I found no memorable quotes in the series, though lots of witty banter.All of the episodes felt nicely done, not a dud in the bunch.Overall:Though not a show filled with much special effects, it's worth watching for the character of Harry Dresden, who I have nothing negative to say about. Had they given this series a second season, no question I would have watched it.If you're looking for a show similar to Supernatural, Buffy, or Witchblade, this is not that show, in my opinion....well, kind of like Witchblade, actually.If however you're looking for a show that has some supernatural elements while mostly a fun detective show, this one will please you.That's My Opinion But You're Welcome To It.",4,Not a classic but definitely worth owning!,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,3049,"['First', 'want', 'point', 'shame', 'finger', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'who', 'reason', 'single', 'star', 'simply', 'series', 'differences', 'book', 'due', 'respect', 'grow', 'up', 'name', 'ONE', 'book', 'made', 'series', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'have', 'differences', 'might', 'get', 'slew', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'votes', 'people', 'saying', 'Eh', 'not', 'too', 'concerned', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'series', 'not', 'how', 'books.The', 'Characters', 'Harry', 'Dresden', 'off', 'very', 'likeable', 'naturally', 'funny', 'wizard', 'listed', 'phone', 'book', 'yet', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'pretty', 'nice', 'magic', 'when', 'conservative', 'careful', 'when', 'will', 'use', 'not.The', 'actor', 'playing', 'Paul', 'Blackthorne', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'very', 'believable', 'performance.Lt', 'Connie', 'Murphy', 'ok', 'character', 'opinion', 'touch', 'single', 'divorcee', 'mother', 'Dresden', 'more', 'magical', 'aspects', 'even', ""n't"", 'believe', 'magic', 'herself', 'only', 'real', 'negatives', 'have', 'A', 'believable', 'chemistry', 'Dresden', 'opinion', 'eventual', 'hint', 'attraction', 'feels', 'weird.B', 'episodes', 'are', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'when', 'just', 'Dresden', 'only', 'limited', 'number', 'scenes.Hrothbert', 'Bob', 'Bainbridge', 'amusing', 'character', 'obvious', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'However', 'actor', 'playing', 'horrible', 'accent', 'acting', 'better', 'suited', 'stage', 'play', 'TV', 'series', 'very', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'delivery', 'body', 'movements', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'often', 'opinion.Warden', 'Donald', 'Morgan', 'Warden', 'High', 'Council', 'kind', 'police', 'wizards', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'pretty', 'good', 'mostly', 'serious', 'just', 'enough', 'charisma', 'be', 'likeable', 'character', 'banter', 'Dresden', 'when', 'difference', 'opinion', 'based', 'not', 'only', 'Morgan', 'being', 'stickler', 'rules', 'also', 'Dresden', 'have', 'different', 'personalities.The', 'Writing', 'writing', 'tamer', 'probably', 'should', 'be', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'stuck', 'series', 'original', 'television', 'run', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'bunch', 'flashy', 'magic', 'scenes', 'focusing', 'more', 'character', 'interaction', 'devlopment', 'writing', 'kind', 'reminded', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'safe', 'kids', 'watch', 'most', 'part.Personally', 'found', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'series', 'lots', 'witty', 'banter.All', 'episodes', 'felt', 'nicely', 'done', 'not', 'dud', 'bunch.Overall', 'not', 'show', 'filled', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'worth', 'watching', 'character', 'Harry', 'Dresden', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'negative', 'say', 'Had', 'given', 'series', 'second', 'season', 'question', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'it.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'show', 'similar', 'Supernatural', 'Buffy', 'Witchblade', 'not', 'show', 'opinion', '.well', 'kind', 'Witchblade', 'actually.If', 'however', ""'re"", 'looking', 'show', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'mostly', 'fun', 'detective', 'show', 'one', 'will', 'please', 'you.That', 'My', 'Opinion', ""'re"", 'Welcome']",The Dresden Files: Season 1

This addictive series had at least a few more seasons worth of stories in it, and--judging at how good this, the first season was--I'm sure things would have just kept getting better and better.  But, alas, we're left with one twelve episode season.I've never read an entire ""Dresden"" book.  I can see you readers going to vote this review as ""unhelpful"" right now, but I urge you to wait a second.  I've read one of Jim' Butcher's short stories featuring Harry Dresden, which was remarkable, and I am currently waiting to receive the first book in the mail (I'm anal about having my collection in only hardcover, and the book was just release for the first time in that format).  I don't have much prior knowledge of the Dresden-verse to base my interpretation of the show on, and I think that my review, because of that, shall be as unbiased as any you'll find here.The mythology of here is great; Harry's powers are never used to cop out of a tricky plot line, only to supply interesting twists in the story.  Each episode will keep you on your toes, urging you to try to figure out the mystery along with Harry, which--seeing as Harry isn't only a wizard, he's also a good detective and pretty much a hero--you likely won't be able to.  While each episode is a standalone monster-of-the-week type story, the interactions and development BETWEEN the characters (specifially between Harry and Bob, as well as Harry and Murphy) becomes the over-arching storyarc of the season.The choice to make Bob appear as a visual ghost instead of a disembodied voice coming from a skull (as he does in the books) was an intelligent one.  Bob's situation and his reflections on it make for some of the most dramatic and emotional moments this series has to offer.  And speaking of those teary little moments, the fact that this show never shied away from the soft-side of Harry was one of the best things about this show; they were willing to focus on the characters as much as the mythology, and that made the show better.I did have a few minor quibbles, though: The pilot, ""Storm Front,"" was filmed before Bob was cast, and also back before some major changes were made.  The placement of this episode in the middle of the series was mind-boggling, in that it felt as if it took place long before the series.  There's no Bob in the episode, it appears Harry is operating out of a different place, and he's in love with a girl who isn't mentioned for the rest of the series.  If only a few scenes had been re shot, the episode would have fit into continuity so much better.  And, not to hate on Paul Blackthorn, who I truly loved as Harry Dresden, but sometimes his American accent (he's a British actor) didn't sound quite right.  I have to stress though, for the most part, I think he did a wonderful job.I was going to end this review with a list of the best episodes, but as soon as I started to pick out the standouts, I realized that there was something that I loved about all of them.  If forced to, I'd say the last two episodes of the series were when the acting, writing, and directing were the strongest, but I'd rather just recommend watching the entire series.  Unfortunately, it didn't last long.

No, it does not deflect or catch bullets, or require Harry to hold it up in front of said firearm. Did they even bother to read the books?The series could have been called ""The Storefront Wizard"" and skipped Dresdin altogether.

1077299,A3747YPXOBXRAT,B000QUEQ4U,Stephen Mann,"[1, 1]","Visual Media versions of print stories often vary from the original source material, causing outrage in those who wanted to see the story made for film. This show polarizes people more than just about any other. It would be fair to say that in its day The Dresden files created as much shock and horror from Jim Butcher's readership as poor old Peter Jackson generated with his LotR trilogy.Let me start by saying that I've read most of the Dresden Files books, and regard them as an okay waste of a few hours but very uneven in feel. Butcher's admitted approach to writing them (according to a talk he gave in NY shortly after the publication of White Night) means that a Dresden story can never be more than a spectator sport anyway; the reader has no chance of anticipating events and becoming thereby part of the story. You pays your money etc.The TV Dresden is what would be called today a ""re-imagining"", not quite a Star Trek ""reboot"" but a remix using the basic ideas from which the books are built. In this approach lies much of the chagrin. ""Harry doesn't look right"". ""Murphy doesn't look right, and they changed her name"". ""What on earth is Bob doing with a face?"" ""The Chateau Dresden isn't right"". etc etc etcWell, let's get that out of the way. All the complaints are spot on. The physical descriptions of just about everything from Dresden to Bianca to the Blue Beetle (now a olive green jeep) are different to those in the books. Big Furry Deal.Okay, anyone who doesn't want show spoilers should move on.The TV Dresden is an excellent envisioning of the Wizard private eye, with a great screen presence and just the right amount of slobbish attitude for the role. Much has been made of the improvised nature of the Wizard Staff (or Hockey Stick) and blasting rod (now a drumstick) but I think these actually work well to reinforce the image of the down-at-heel, one step away from the bailiff wizard with barely two bucks to rub together. The Jeep was picked for the ease of camera work (can't see the actors in a VW Beetle) but the rationale for the Beetle in the books actually works better for the Jeep (lack of mechanical complexity) in my opinion. Murphy isn't blonde, but *is* in-your-face feisty (though I have to agree changing her name was dumb and the suggestion she has a nine year old daughter - whom we never see - is unnecessary). Some characters from the books appear wearing new and unexpected faces. Some are in very different roles than in the books - Bianca is a vampire of the Red Court, but that's about all that survives the transition to the screen. If this is going to ruin the experience for you, better save your dollars for more books.The Special Effects are good for their day (people forget how quickly the state of the art in CGI advanced when they critique this show sometimes) but sometimes have a slightly bargain basement feel, especially when the producers attempt to ""wow"" the viewer. As I say, the pace of progress should inform the viewer, but it should also inform the maker of cgi-intensive shows and dictate a suitable approach to using SFX.What really makes or breaks a show is, of course, the plot and character interaction we get to see, and like any show in its first season, these tend to vary. Occasionally there is a whiff of ""the special effects will blind everyone to the lack of quality plot here"", but on the whole the plots are tight, the stories compelling and the chemistry between the actors is convincing, especially that between Harry and Bob the Skull.Remaking the character Bob into a cursed sorcerer whose spirit is bound to the skull for eternity for a wizardly crime was inspired, and getting the actor Terrence Mann to play Bob was genius. The irony of Paul Blackthorne (Harry) being an Englishman using an American accent and Terrence Mann being an American using an English accent is a free gift (both seem well executed to my ears). Scenes between Bob and Harry are generally high spots in each show, though sometimes the actors have to work with dialog that makes them work for their money.Finally, I thought combining Dresden's workplace with his voluminous living quarters was a good move. It gave the actors space to use when setting the scene for each episode.I enjoyed the show, and this three disc set represents it in a nice package. there are a couple of deleted scenes, a couple of commentaries and a ""making of"" featurette and that's it for the special features. I wished for more, but didn't buy the discs for the blooper reels and cutting room floor sweepings.I'm sorry this show didn't get a large enough following to garner a second season. The first season was only twelve episodes too (do you remember when a season was 24 shows or more?) so it burned bright but burned quickly. I doubt being more faithful to the books would have made it more popular, but who knows? Personally, I rather like the original touches the show added to the Dresden Files, *including* the hockey stick and a Bob you can see.",4,Not The Dresden Files From The Books (And Take From That What

1077318,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000QUEQ4U,Tim Janson,"[20, 21]","Well there is good new and bad news for fans of Harry Dresden. The good news is that the complete first season of the Sci-Fi Channel TV show is now on DVD. The bad news is that it looks like it will be the ONLY season on DVD. The dim-witted executives of the network have evidently decided to cancel the series after just one season. Apparently they need more room on their schedule for Star Trek reruns, professional wrestling, and movies about giant snakes and bugs. Let me get this straight...Dresden is canceled after one season yet we get a second season of Who Wants to be a Superhero? This is why the Sci-Fi channel continues to be the most under-performing network in existence.This three-disc set contains all twelve episodes and a smattering of special features. The show is based on a very successful series of fantasy/mystery novels by Jim Butcher. Set in Chicago, Harry Dresden (Paul Blackthorne) is a wizard-for-hire...you can even find him in the Yellow Pages. This is an urban landscape populated by vampires, werewolves, demons, and both good and evil wizards. Dresden is frequently called on for assistance by beautiful police lieutenant Connie Murphy (Valerie Cruz), to help solve bizarre cases that deal with the supernatural. Murphy is a skeptic, but she also knows that Dresden gets results. Harry is frequently aided and advised by the spirit of a long deceased wizard named Bob (Terrence Mann), who normally resides inside his own skull, which Harry owns.The TV series doesn't get into as much detail as the books of course, but some of Butcher's various factions do find their way into the show such as the White Council, or High Council, who is the governing body for wizards in the world. There are also various groups of rival vampire clans such as the Red Court and Black Court.In the pilot episode, ""Birds of a Feather"", a middle-school boy wants to hire Harry because he thinks that monsters are after him. Harry dismisses it as a kid's over-active imagination. However, when Murphy calls in Harry to help with a murder case of a woman skinned alive, Harry realizes the boy's claims were no joke.""Storm Front"" is based on Butcher's first novel of the same name. A pair of lovers are found dead with their hearts ripped from their chests. Exploded out of their chests is more accurate and Harry knows only one thing could have done this...black magic. The High Council suspects that Harry is the murderer and sends their chief Warden Morgan to keep an eye on him. Harry has to find out who committed the murders and how before the crime is pinned on him. This was the only book in the series that I've actually read and although it's a very condensed version, I thought it was a very strong adaptation of the book.In ""Bad Blood"", the beautiful vampire nightclub owner, Bianca, comes to Harry for help after an attempt is made on her life. She thinks the High Council is responsible. When the Council's assassination squad is wiped out, they blame Bianca and Harry finds himself trapped between the two parties with no hope of compromise.I've mentioned only a handful of the episodes but there really isn't a bad episode in the dozen. Those who have read all the books may pick apart some of the details but one has to allow for poetic license for TV. Paul Blackthorne is superb as Harry because he isn't your typical, pretty boy leading man. He plays the character in reserved fashion, staying within the role and never chewing scenery.

But all of a sudden in episode 8, Harry starts breaking out the firepower and starts showing a little of his defiance and anger and why his enemies might start to fear him a little. Paul Blackthorne does a nice job with Harry, making him both likeable, human, amusing, and at the same time showing his relentlessness and strength.I don't mind the changes from the book, it's kind of fun to see things from a different angle, and bearing in mind that they probably couldn't afford to do a lot of scenes in the Never-never for instance. I *am* hoping to catch a glimpse of Michael Carpenter by the end of the series, but I don't know whether that will happen or not.I did like seeing the blue VW beetle up on the rack at the mechanic's shop, nice homage to the book, and it was good to catch a glimpse of Mister.Can't they ever keep a fun series on the air long enough for it to catch on?
