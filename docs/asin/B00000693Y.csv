493367,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00000693Y,Acute Observer,"[1, 3]","The January Man, 1989 filmIt is New Year's eve. People celebrate the start of a new year in hope of better times. A wealthy heiress is murdered! She was a friend of Mayor's daughter, and the Mayor wants action now! There is a fire, a fireman rescues a child and gives artificial respiration to save her. A detective talks to fireman Nick. He is reinstated to the police force. His career depends on Nick's acceptance. Nick returns to his apartment and finds visitors there (for the light). The Mayor explains his policies and exercises his powers. A woman visits Nick Strayer and looks at his books. [Can you tell about a person by his/her readings?] Did Nick forgive Franklin for making him the fall guy? Nick and Christine argue over their past. Nick was blames in a scandal. His new office is redecorated!Detective Nick wants all the reports and photographs for all the eleven murders. Also a NEC computer with Lotus Agenda. [Product placement?] He attends Alice Hawkins' funeral. He follows a young woman to an ice-skating rink. They talk. What next? She tells Nick about Allison, they visit the apartment. [That computer dates this movie.] Nick looks at the records of the murder victims. The murderer picked the locks of the victims! What was the motive? Can he figure out the next murder? Nick and Frank argue over who Mom loved more. Bernadette meets Mrs. Starkey. Nick studies the day of the murder, each was on a prime number. But where will the next murder occur? Is there a pattern to these murders? We see another murder. A man goes out a window. He broke a window to get in, unlike the previous eleven murders. The Mayor arrives, Nick explains why this could be the wrong man, but he is ignored. He returns home to find Bernadette. Can he solve the crime anyway? Nick looks at the stars in the skies. Can he get support?Can Nick get a volunteer as a decoy? Yes. A computer is used to analyze the crime scenes. There is a pattern to the locations. Which floor? There is a tune whose notes fit the locations. Nick prepares a stake-out. They see a man pick a lock! They will send in da decoy instead of the occupant. [Is there a flaw in their plan?] There is a chase down the stairs. Police cars arrive. ""Do you know who I am?"" Nick wraps up the killer for delivery to the police. ""He's nobody"" says Nick. Nick rejects Christine, but she gives him a check. [Was this the missing evidence?] Bernadette kisses Nick. Will they be happy together?I found parts of this story implausible. Remember what Raymond Chandler said about murders created for a puzzle? The seems based on the story of the ""Boston Strangler"" but modified into a comedy / drama. It is too funny for a murder mystery and too serious for a comedy. Compare this to ""Wrongfully Accused"", a parody of ""The Fugitive"". Does the disguise of the killer seem both false and implausible? Not to mention controversial. Was this the first movie to use a personal computer to help solve a murder?",2,Catching a Serial Killer,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,2960,"['January', 'Man', '1989', 'filmIt', 'New', 'Year', 'eve', 'People', 'celebrate', 'start', 'new', 'year', 'hope', 'better', 'times', 'wealthy', 'heiress', 'murdered', 'was', 'friend', 'Mayor', 'daughter', 'Mayor', 'action', 'now', 'fire', 'fireman', 'child', 'artificial', 'respiration', 'save', 'detective', 'talks', 'fireman', 'Nick', 'reinstated', 'police', 'force', 'career', 'Nick', 'acceptance', 'Nick', 'apartment', 'visitors', 'there', 'light', 'Mayor', 'policies', 'powers', 'woman', 'Nick', 'Strayer', 'books', '[', 'Can', 'tell', 'person', 'his/her', 'readings', ']', 'Did', 'Nick', 'forgive', 'Franklin', 'making', 'fall', 'guy', 'Nick', 'Christine', 'argue', 'past', 'Nick', 'was', 'blames', 'scandal', 'new', 'office', 'redecorated', 'Detective', 'Nick', 'reports', 'photographs', 'eleven', 'murders', 'Also', 'NEC', 'computer', 'Lotus', 'Agenda', '[', 'Product', 'placement', 'Alice', 'Hawkins', 'funeral', 'young', 'woman', 'ice-skating', 'rink', 'talk', 'What', 'Nick', 'Allison', 'visit', 'apartment', '[', 'computer', 'movie', 'Nick', 'records', 'murder', 'victims', 'murderer', 'picked', 'locks', 'victims', 'What', 'was', 'motive', 'Can', 'figure', 'out', 'next', 'murder', 'Nick', 'Frank', 'argue', 'who', 'Mom', 'loved', 'more', 'Bernadette', 'Mrs.', 'Starkey', 'Nick', 'studies', 'day', 'murder', 'was', 'prime', 'number', 'where', 'will', 'next', 'murder', 'occur', 'there', 'pattern', 'murders', 'see', 'murder', 'man', 'out', 'window', 'broke', 'window', 'get', 'previous', 'eleven', 'murders', 'Mayor', 'arrives', 'Nick', 'why', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'man', 'ignored', 'home', 'find', 'Bernadette', 'Can', 'solve', 'crime', 'anyway', 'Nick', 'stars', 'skies', 'Can', 'get', 'support', 'Can', 'Nick', 'get', 'volunteer', 'decoy', 'Yes', 'computer', 'used', 'analyze', 'crime', 'scenes', 'pattern', 'locations', 'Which', 'floor', 'tune', 'notes', 'fit', 'locations', 'Nick', 'stake-out', 'see', 'man', 'lock', 'will', 'send', 'da', 'decoy', 'instead', 'occupant', '[', 'there', 'flaw', 'plan', ']', 'chase', 'down', 'stairs', 'Police', 'cars', 'arrive', 'Do', 'know', 'who', 'am', 'Nick', 'up', 'killer', 'delivery', 'police', 'nobody', 'Nick', 'Nick', 'Christine', 'check', '[', 'Was', 'missing', 'evidence', ']', 'Bernadette', 'Nick', 'Will', 'be', 'happy', 'together', 'found', 'parts', 'story', 'implausible', 'Remember', 'what', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'said', 'murders', 'created', 'puzzle', 'based', 'story', 'Boston', 'Strangler', 'modified', 'comedy', '/', 'drama', 'too', 'funny', 'murder', 'mystery', 'too', 'serious', 'comedy', 'Compare', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'parody', 'Fugitive', 'disguise', 'killer', 'seem', 'false', 'implausible', 'Not', 'mention', 'controversial', 'Was', 'first', 'movie', 'use', 'personal', 'computer', 'help', 'solve', 'murder']",January Man VHS
493368,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00000693Y,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 10]","Comedy?  Thriller?  Suspense?  I guess that these are all words or genres that you could use to describe this film.  I would use these words if I wanted to gloss over the true feeling of this film.  I would use these words if I had to sell this wallow-some film to a distributor who didn't know any better.  I would use these words lightly, because if I ever believed them the battle would be forever lost.  This was not a comedy.  It was not a thriller.  It definitely was not a suspense.  So, what was it?  After viewing this film I came to the conclusion that The January Man reminded me of a puzzle put together by a two-year-old.  While all the pieces were in the box to put together, sadly the infant size brain of the child chose to smash the pieces together instead of place them in corresponding orders.  Thus, you have a jumbled mess with wedged pieces of what could have been an overall beautiful picture.  With poor acting, a confusing plot that literally went nowhere and an ending that felt forced and premature, one can see that this puzzle is unfixable by even the best puzzler in the world.  If I were those involved with the creation, I would definitely be ashamed.To begin, what was wrong with the actors?  Nobody seemed like they were giving 10% much less 50% of their effort for this film.  Even the great ones like Keitel, Kline, and Sarandon felt like they were walking through the motions with equally confused eyes and hearts.  Kline's New York accent faded in and out throughout the film giving us no glimpse of his actual character.  His role was never fully defined, so the other half of the time that we watch him on screen we just don't care about him at all.  This was one of the worst leading characters of all time.  Thankfully, a completely miscast team that seemed more interested in the money than actually ""acting"" backs him up.  Keitel was horrible in this film.  I am a huge fan of his body of work, but in this one he walked, talked, and gave those emotionless eyes a rest.  He provided nothing of value to this production.  The same can be said about Sarandon, whose character seemed unfocused and undervalued, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who never really got her feet wet in Hollywood until Maid Marion arrived at her doorstep.  Alan Rickman was wasted, as well as the one-leveled voices of Danny Aiello and Rod Steiger whose only direction from Pat O'Conner was to yell.  In other words, if you are interested in seeing this film for the acting, you will be greatly disappointed.Second, perhaps the acting can be overlooked by a strong story line?  WRONG!  This was the most convoluted script that I have ever seen Hollywood produce.  We spend the first forty minutes learning about an event that happened two years ago that is never fully explained anyway.  It reminded of those times that the teacher would say in class that we should all listen up because this wasn't going to be on the test.  Then why bother.  This set the spiraling downfall for the rest of the film.  This unavailable information also lead to some pretty choppy chemistry between the actors.  I never say Kline and Keitel as brothers.  I never saw the relationship with Sarandon possible.  In fact, now that I think about it, I didn't see any of the actors meshing well together because they were working with a script that was focused on all the wrong parts.  Eventually, The January Man gets so caught up on this secondary story that we find ourselves rushed into an ending and a solution that seems laughable instead of plausible.  We even have a villain that is so confusing that I don't even think he knew what he was doing in the film.  The final thirty minutes of this film were the worst parts of this movie, second to all the parts before that.  Whoever wrote this script must have just forgotten the basic rules of storytelling because nothing meshed well at all.Finally, I would have to comment that the marketing for this film could feel like a cheated ticket to some filmgoers.  After reading some reviews for this film, I was expecting to find myself chuckling out loud at the antics of Kevin Kline and his spin on the world of investigation.  I was wrong.  There was no humor in this film at all.  Even when O'Conner tried to bring some in, it seemed forced and unhealthy.  I must repeat, this is not a comedy.  It even isn't really that suspenseful, nor is the thrilling aspect actually that thrilling.  I must admit that whomever sold this film to a company under the guise that it was a comedy should be awarded the ""Best Salesman of the Decade"" award.  Somebody believed this film was funny and even pasted a preview to it with the word ""comedy"" written all over it.  Someone sold the company a broken product ... hook, line, and sinker.  I just ask you to beware.Overall, this film was horrible.  From the poor acting, the cryptic story that needed some form of decoder ring to understand, the passionless actors, to the harshly branded word ""comedy"", January Man proves that not all films should be made and that an advanced screen process should be used regularly.  I genuinely encourage you to skip this film.  No good will come of you watching this mess.  I promise.Grade: * out of *****",1,"The world is either great or wretched, isn't it?",1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,5232,"['Comedy', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'guess', 'are', 'words', 'genres', 'could',

You root for the good guys, you love it when the bad guys get theirs'. Kline's  character is a mixture of tough love and eccentric genius. He and his love  interests play well off each other. All the supporting stars around Kline  do a top rate job and leave the circle unbroken. Allan Rickman is really  funny as a way offbeat artist who gets roped in to helping Kline figure out  where and when the serial killer is going to strike. The final scene  between the killer and Kline is somewhat slapstickish but also a  choreographed ballet that would make the old silent stars proud. I've  watched this movie many times and I never get tired of it. I know many of  the lines by heart but I can always find something small and wonderful I  missed the time before.

493370,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00000693Y,Austin Somlo,"[2, 4]","Viewed: 10/04, 5/08Rate: 15/08: The sole reason for revisiting The January Man is to see how bad it was. It's not the kind of a film that is ""so bad it's so good"" or ""so bad it's bad"" but rather ""so stupid it's so absurdly ridiculous."" Indeed it was. Ever get the moment when you have a box of jigsaw puzzle where none of the pieces fits in together? That's what happens with the dialogues of The January Man. There wasn't a single line that connected, and there wasn't a scene that made sense. Oh the scenes...they were painfully bad and not to mention how embarrassingly bad some of them were. The sight of Rod Steiger overacting and Danny Aiello too was enough to make me want to drop a nuclear weapon on my mind. In short, it was almost of a contest to see who the worse actor of the day was. Harvey Keitel looked uncomfortable standing there and absorbing the lines from Rod Steiger, Danny Aiello, or Kevin Kline. He must have been thinking, ""What the f*** am I doing here?"" And his face said it all. Now to the meat of the picture where the picture fails in its entirety: the bizarre setup of the serial killer mystery. First, Starkey deduces that the murder happens on the day that corresponds with the prime number of the date of each month. Then there is some astrological sign...excuse me...constellation sign...about the choosing of the apartments. Thereafter, we have a selection of rooms in terms of a musical tone. Finally, we have our The January Man. He does this, more or less, in a day. Interestingly, I don't see a sign of an investigation team who previously worked on the case. Instead, the files were just whisked away in some lost unlocked office right in the file cabinet. Back to the apartment thing, I wonder what would happen if that room has a male occupant living there instead of a woman. Or a possible idea that she might be going away on a trip? Or perhaps a husband and wife? How does the killer know it's that exact room from the exterior point of view when he walks inside of the apartment? If he actually did think up of this elaborate scheme, it would be nice to know if he really has a clue how appealing the idea of life could be for him. Speaking of the relationship between the characters of Susan Sarandon and Kevin Kline, their conflict was poorly explained, and, needless to say, what was the point of bringing it up? Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wasted in this film even though she does a gratuitous nude scene. At any rate, I thought she did fine in her role. It's nice to see Alan Rickman again who is actually good in this picture but also wasted. The January Man tries to pass off as a comedy (at least that's what I think) and fails to create a single laughter from me. Moreover, it almost doesn't fall into mystery section since the idea of having one may have filled in the premise in terms of why the film was made in the first place in order to bring in light of everything else (and there was, in fact, nothing else to be seen). Whenever Starkey cooks dinner, the wife from Frenzy comes to mind. That didn't help either. All in all, despite its ""all-star"" cast, The January Man has all of the elements to be defined as the prototypical Ed Wood murder mystery movie. Man, this film is a mess. This one deservingly sees its rating fall from `4' to `1'.",1,Rod Steiger and Danny Aiello Are Screaming At Each Other!,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,3307,"['Viewed', '10/04', '5/08Rate', '15/08', 'sole', 'reason', 'revisiting', 'January', 'Man', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'bad', 'bad', 'rather', 'so', 'stupid', 'so', 'absurdly', 'ridiculous', 'Indeed', 'was', 'Ever', 'get', 'moment', 'when', 'have', 'box', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'where', 'none', 'pieces', 'fits', 'together', 'what', 'dialogues', 'January', 'Man', 'was', ""n't"", 'single', 'line', 'connected', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'scene', 'made', 'sense', 'Oh', 'scenes', 'were', 'painfully', 'bad', 'not', 'mention', 'how', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'were', 'sight', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'overacting', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'too', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'drop', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'mind', 'short', 'was', 'almost', 'contest', 'see', 'who', 'worse', 'actor', 'day', 'was', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'looked', 'uncomfortable', 'standing', 'there', 'absorbing', 'lines', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'thinking', 'What', 'f***', 'am', 'doing', 'here', 'face', 'said', 'Now', 'meat', 'picture', 'where', 'picture', 'entirety', 'bizarre', 'setup', 'serial', 'killer', 'mystery', 'First', 'Starkey', 'murder', 'day', 'prime', 'number', 'date', 'month', 'Then', 'astrological', 'sign', 'constellation', 'sign', 'choosing', 'apartments', 'Thereafter', 'have', 'selection', 'rooms', 'terms', 'musical', 'tone', 'Finally', 'have', 'January', 'Man', 'more', 'less', 'day', 'Interestingly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'sign', 'investigation', 'team', 'who', 'previously', 'worked', 'case', 'Instead', 'files', 'were', 'just', 'whisked', 'away', 'lost', 'unlocked', 'office', 'right', 'file', 'cabinet', 'Back', 'apartment', 'thing', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'room', 'male', 'occupant', 'living', 'instead', 'woman', 'possible', 'idea', 'might', 'be', 'going', 'away', 'trip', 'perhaps', 'husband', 'wife', 'How', 'killer', 'know', 'exact', 'room', 'exterior', 'point', 'view', 'when', 'walks', 'apartment', 'actually', 'did', 'think', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'know', 'really', 'clue', 'how', 'appealing', 'idea', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'Speaking', 'relationship', 'characters', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'conflict', 'was', 'poorly', 'explained', 'needless', 'say', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'bringing', 'up', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mastrantonio', 'wasted', 'film', 'even', 'gratuitous', 'nude', 'scene', 'rate', 'thought', 'did', 'fine', 'role', 'nice', 'see', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'again', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'picture', 'also', 'wasted', 'January', 'Man', 'pass', 'off', 'comedy', 'least', 'what', 'think', 'create', 'single', 'laughter', 'Moreover', 'almost', ""n't"", 'fall', 'mystery', 'section', 'idea', 'having', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'filled', 'premise', 'terms', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'first', 'place', 'order', 'bring', 'light', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'fact', 'nothing', 'else', 'be', 'seen', 'Whenever', 'Starkey', 'dinner', 'wife', 'Frenzy', 'mind', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'all-star', 'cast', 'January', 'Man', 'elements', 'be', 'defined', 'prototypical', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'murder', 'mystery', 'movie', 'Man', 'film', 'mess', 'one', 'deservingly', 'rating', 'fall', '4', '1']",January Man VHS

I mean: Kevin Kline, Harvey Keitel AND Alan Rickman! What more could a grown woman want?The movie uses clich&eacute;s with a twist: a heroic but difficult cop (Kline) who has been unjustly sacked and is now a fireman, but - being a genius in his work - gets called back to solve mysterious killings. Of course, the police department is against the idea. But there is no choice and he starts to work in his own terms, for instance bringing along an assistant, a moody artist (Rickman in a part where he speaks very little, which is always a shame). Brother (Keitel) isn't too thrilled either, because they still love the same woman (Sarandon). Mayor's daughter (Mastrantonio) gets sucked in, because her friend is murdered.The movie has all the elements of comedy, humour, suspense and good actors and actresses - and still it misses something.

You have a script from Oscar winning writer John Patrick Shanley (Moonstruck); a cast any director would die for; and an initially interesting premise.  But even with all that, THE JANUARY MAN is not a good movie.  Shanley's script is so disjointed and the only attempt at comedy seems to be Kline's physical confrontation with the killer.  It takes the movie at least thirty minutes to focus on the killings, and even then, it plods along.  Shanley may have tried to hard to force the genres to work, and it shows.  And director Pat O'Connor should be required to do community service for his mishandling of this talented cast.  Kevin Kline, usually a strong presence in any film, plays Nick Starkey like it was an After School special--bland, unfocused and murky.  Susan Sarandon, who has won an Oscar, tries to be a kind of Julia Roberts femme fatale, but she's about as seductive as a seahorse.  Rod Steiger and Danny Aiello overact so badly, it's hard to believe these gentlemen have given us such good work in the past.  Harvey Keitel needs to play villains if this is how he chooses to embody a ""good guy"" for a change.  Alan Rickman's Ed is stereotypical artiste, but he at least adds some needed color to the movie.  And Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio is pathetically dull and lethargic.THE JANUARY MAN could have been a good thriller, but under O'Connor's awful direction and Shanley's poorly developed script, it merely becomes one of those classic examples of a good movie gone bad.",2,WHAT WENT WRONG?,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,1539,"['What', 'world', 'happened', 'clunker', 'have', 'script', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'writer', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'Moonstruck', 'cast', 'director', 'would', 'die', 'initially', 'interesting', 'premise', 'even', 'JANUARY', 'MAN', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'Shanley', 'script', 'so', 'disjointed', 'only', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'be', 'Kline', 'physical', 'confrontation', 'killer', 'movie', 'least', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'focus', 'killings', 'even', 'then', 'along', 'Shanley', 'may', 'have', 'tried', 'hard', 'force', 'genres', 'work', 'director', 'Pat', ""O'Connor"", 'should', 'be', 'required', 'do', 'community', 'service', 'mishandling', 'talented', 'cast', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'usually', 'strong', 'presence', 'film', 'Nick', 'Starkey', 'was', 'School', 'special', 'bland', 'unfocused', 'murky', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'be', 'kind', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'femme', 'fatale', 'about', 'as', 'seductive', 'seahorse', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'overact', 'so', 'badly', 'hard', 'believe', 'gentlemen', 'have', 'given', 'such', 'good', 'work', 'past', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'play', 'villains', 'how', 'embody', 'good', 'guy', 'change', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Ed', 'stereotypical', 'artiste', 'least', 'needed', 'color', 'movie', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mastroantonio', 'pathetically', 'dull', 'lethargic.THE', 'JANUARY', 'MAN', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'thriller', ""O'Connor"", 'awful', 'direction', 'Shanley', 'poorly', 'developed', 'script', 'merely', 'one', 'classic', 'examples', 'good', 'movie', 'gone', 'bad']",January Man VHS

The characters unravel intriguingly but very fluidly, and it is easy to relate to almost all of them (I bet we can all think of parallels in our own lives.)Theme-wise it is ostensibly presented as a suspense movie where an ex-cop (Kevin Kline) is re-instated into a homicide detective role to solve a brutal murder spree by a NY psychopath. There is an interesting subplot of unrequited romance between Kline's character and his brother's (who is commissioner of police) wife. Kline's artist friend, his new girl friend (the Mayor's daughter), and in fact the Mayor himself -- are all amusing characters. But Kline is clearly the pivot of the movie, he turned what many might consider a very below standard screenplay and turned it into a very keepable film.The cinematography is neat, the dialog entertainingly scattershot and the movie flows with a very good pace. Most people who revile this under-rated but actually very watchable movie do so because it doesn't fit any Hollywoodesqe molds. It is not a suspense movie alone (clearly, to me, it didn't make any overt attempts to be) -- it is also a very adult and somewhat intellectual but credible study of multiple intertwined characters.The ending surprised me a bit, but I don't think it was chinsy or overdone.

493400,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00000693Y,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 0]","""The January Man"" is an offbeat thriller for adults -- it's as if a Sherlock Holmes movie were made by the writers of ""Seinfeld"" after watching ""Breakfast at Tiffany's.""The always pleasant and underused Kevin Kline stars as Nick, a disgraced police detective reluctantly put back into service to track down a serial killer whose MO relies on a baffling series of logical quirks.  Along the way, we meet his upwardly mobile ex-girlfriend (Susan Sarandon), now married to his generally unlikable brother (Harvey Keitel), the mayor he works for (Rod Steiger), and the mayor's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  Danny Aiello and Alan Rickman round out the cast, as Nick's hostile police superior and artist best friend respectively.  The cast is without fail entertaining and works hard to create strong characters.The movie's greatest strength is also the one thing that will most annoy some audiences -- it invests a lot more in the characters than the plot.  In this, ""The January Man"" is much more a lighthearted drama than a serious thriller, and if you're looking for the latter, there are far better movies in the genre, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" perhaps the best example.  On the other hand, if you want to watch a movie that actually takes the time to develop its characters, this may be the one for you.  In fact, I was actually hoping there would be more on them because of how the sincere investment works, and that's the movie's only real flaw.Take, for instance, the scene where Kline seduces Mastrantonio or, perhaps, where she allows herself to be seduced.  After following her from a funeral to ice skating (it works better on screen than it sounds), his moment of complete honesty at her urging about his desire for her is the one thing she might hear to agree to sleep with him.  How the scene turns out, including the un-formulaic behavior of the characters, has a ring of grown-up truth to it, if you've walked this planet enough years and found yourself in situations you'd never dreamed of being in.  But audiences looking for a standard Hollywood resolution will likely be shaking their heads instead.Norman Jewison's steady direction never interferes with the unfolding of the story nor relies on the sorts of visual distractions that movies with even less plot and characterization must turn to today to keep the audience's attention.  There is something very 1960s in the way the characters are conceived and something very 1970s in the way the story is told, even if it is a product of the late 1980s.  Except for the music and fashion and some computer nonsense, one might believe it had been made a decade before.  These, again, may seem to work against each other, but actually give the film more dimension than many made after 1980.",4,Underrated and Misunderstood Dramedy Thriller,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,2767,"['January', 'Man', 'offbeat', 'thriller', 'adults', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'movie', 'were', 'made', 'writers', 'Seinfeld', 'watching', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'always', 'pleasant', 'underused', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Nick', 'disgraced', 'police', 'detective', 'reluctantly', 'put', 'back', 'service', 'track', 'down', 'serial', 'killer', 'MO', 'baffling', 'series', 'logical', 'quirks', 'way', 'meet', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'now', 'married', 'generally', 'unlikable', 'brother', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'mayor', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'mayor', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mastrantonio', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'Nick', 'hostile', 'police', 'superior', 'artist', 'best', 'friend', 'respectively', 'cast', 'fail', 'entertaining', 'hard', 'create', 'strong', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'greatest', 'strength', 'also', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'most', 'annoy', 'audiences', 'lot', 'more', 'characters', 'plot', 'January', 'Man', 'much', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'drama', 'serious', 'thriller', ""'re"", 'looking', 'latter', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'movies', 'genre', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'perhaps', 'best', 'example', 'other', 'hand', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'actually', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'fact', 'was', 'actually', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'how', 'sincere', 'investment', 'works', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'flaw.Take', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'Kline', 'Mastrantonio', 'perhaps', 'where', 'be', 'seduced', 'following', 'funeral', 'ice', 'skating', 'better', 'screen', 'moment', 'complete', 'honesty', 'urging', 'desire', 'one', 'thing', 'might', 'hear', 'agree', 'sleep', 'How', 'scene', 'out', 'including', 'un-formulaic', 'behavior', 'characters', 'ring', 'grown-up', 'truth', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'planet', 'enough', 'years', 'found', 'situations', ""'d"", 'never', 'dreamed', 'being', 'audiences', 'looking', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'resolution', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'shaking', 'heads', 'instead.Norman', 'Jewison', 'steady', 'direction', 'never', 'unfolding', 'story', 'relies', 'sorts', 'visual', 'distractions', 'movies', 'even', 'less', 'plot', 'characterization', 'must', 'turn', 'today', 'keep', 'audience', 'attention', 'something', 'very', '1960s', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'conceived', 'something', 'very', '1970s', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'even', 'product', 'late', '1980s', 'music', 'fashion', 'computer', 'nonsense', 'one', 'might', 'believe', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'decade', 'again', 'may', 'seem', 'work', 'other', 'actually', 'give', 'film', 'more', 'dimension', 'many', 'made', '1980']",January Man VHS
