E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I was all ready to sit here and claim that Heavy Petting is just another predictably written romantic film but then... they go and throw a funny and highly intelligent dog into the mix, and it works!  It won me over!Alright, so it didn't win me over initially- it took time for the storyline to develop because quite frankly, the first 30 minutes of film are pretty darn awful and cliched focusing entirely around two single men doing really idiotic and unfunny things at a nightclub in an attempt to impress the ladies.  It was terrible.  I was honestly preparing myself for the worst but then, to my surprise, the movie *does* slowly improve once the dog enters the picture.A couple scenes that were really hysterical to me were the following-- When the man enters a pet store and asks for the biggest toy available.  Well the cashier man gives him the surprise of his life!- When the man takes his dog to a clothing store and the dog walks around like a fashion model, lol.  I don't even know how they trained the dog to go along with this.  This happens later in the film.- When the man and his girlfriend were trying to make out in bed, but every time the man would look over towards the chair he'd see the dog watching him, and would then become distracted.- When the man was trying to sleep and the dog would sneak up towards his face and let out a shocking bark, lol.  Then the man turns around and does the same thing to the dog!!!- When the dog was digging in the mans pants at the exact moment the man was attempting to make his first move on the girl, lol.Overall, Heavy Petting is proof that a dog CAN make a difference in the quality.  What was originally going to be a 2-star movie is now 4 solid stars.

There are some great comedic moments; the male lead rather reminds me of a young Dick Van Dyke in that he possesses both boyish goofiness and great comedic timing.  If you like a good romance and dogs, I think you'd like this movie.",4,Okay...I found it quirky and sweet.,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,356,"['unfavorable', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'decided', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'found', 'sweet', 'unexpected', 'fun', 'are', 'great', 'comedic', 'moments', 'male', 'lead', 'rather', 'young', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'boyish', 'goofiness', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'like', 'good', 'romance', 'dogs', 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'movie']",Heavy Petting

He decides that he'd like to pursue her and things are going pretty good until she brings a cute dog home named, Babydoll.Now, the problem is, Charlie is not a dog lover and both he and the dog know it.  Just how is Charlie going to pull off acting like one for his new lady.As the story moves along, the adorable dog weaves her way into the very heart of Charlie and he begins to enjoy being with the dog more than the lady. Now he is in big troule because without one, he cannot have the other.This movie was somewhat entertaining but not one that I personally would sit through again. I liked Charlie but my favorite was Babydoll  who I am sure could woo anyone to her side with the blink of her adorable eyes.But to me the story lags a bit and the main highlights were the antics between the man and dog.
