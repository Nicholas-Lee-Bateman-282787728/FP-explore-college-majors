I was aware it was on TV, but never got around to tuning into it. So, I originally started the series on Netflix and bought the DVDs as they came out. It's been a wild ride, and after picking up the first season after it had been out for a while, the other seasons were picked up the week they came out. And this has to be my favorite season. The R2/3PO adventures were probably the only ones that are my least favorite, but the rest of the season is so rock solid that it is phenomenal. I got this on 10/29 and have watched it twice so far. The whole Ventress storyline, the Maul storyline, all of it is awesome. Not too much bad to say other than what I said for season 3: Where's the extras? I kind of like the whole video commentary idea, but I wish they added the artwork books like they did for seasons 1 and 2. But, other than that, live it, love it!

From the reveal of the treacherous jedi general krell, to the rebirth of a beloved sith darth maul. This season adds even more conspiracy to the clone wars.

I found the first half of the season generally disappointing. The Mon Calamari arc didn't do any favors to Admiral Ackbar's character. The Umbaran battle arc has impressive visuals, but dragged on a bit long. I generally found the slaver's arc to be uninspired, with too many silly stereotypes (including an entire race of slaver's with Russian accents).The second half of the season really picked up the pace with Obi-Wan Kenobi's undercover arc. I loved seeing more of the bounty hunters, especially Cad Bane! There were some great moments foreshadowing Anakin Skywalker's downfall. Then, of course, the finale, with Asajj become a freelance agent, Boba Fett getting a helmet, and Darth Maul!Overall, this season definitely showed that the animators have the technical capability to do just about anything on the show.

THIS season however, exceeded expectations!  Unlike Seasons 2 and 3, this season ends on a cliffhanger note that leaves you wanting more, so I can't wait for Season Five.The beginning of the season is sadly weak however.  I found the Mon Cal trilogy to be boring and way too predictable, with no surprises really at all.  Shadow Warrior was a better episode, but again, there was nothing in that episode that made me believe it needed to be there.  Mercy Mission and Nomad Droids were also fun to watch, but pointless in the end.The Umbara arc however put the season on an amazing track, full of surprises, twists, and excellent characters and character development.  The last episode in the arc, Carnage of Krell is one of my favorite episodes!Unfortunately, a great arc led to a weak arc, with the Zygerrian slavers.  I wasn't a big fan of the comic books based on this arc, and I wasn't a big fan of these episodes.  While Kidnapped and Slaves of Republic weren't terrible episodes, Escape from Kadova were one of my least favorite episodes this season.The stand alone episode A Friend in Need on the other hand, was excellent.  It was great to see Pre Vizla again, and the situation has changed with the Death Watch.  The end of the episode left me wanting to see more of them.But alas, the writers keep us waiting by bringing in a different storyline that will change the way you viewed Anakin's sudden turn to the dark side in Star Wars Ep III forever.  Deception and Friends and Enemies were excellent, The Box was a bit weak, but the arc stands strong with its wrap-up episode Crisis on Naboo.Then, finally, the season shifts it's attention back to Asajj Ventress, where she is thrown into a mess of an episode that felt like it was taking elements from Twilight, Harry Potter, and  Lord of the Rings.  Also (spoiler alert), this episode has zombies in it.  Yes.  Though this isn't really new to fans who have read Death Troopers and Red Harvest, both of them being star wars zombie novels, this is a big surprise for a series that's supposedly aimed for kids.Then, the season goes from mystical, magical chaos, to old-fashioned bounty hunter action called Bounty, which is an entertaining but poorly-written episode.  Then there's Brothers, where we see Darth Maul return, and man did Sam Whitwer do an excellent job doing the Sith Lord's voice!  Though Brothers was a tedious start, the season wraps up with an excellent finale Revenge, where we are left with so much debate as to what's going to happen next.  It should be fun to the finish!One more thing, the animation is so-well done this season.  It's unpredictable what they will do, and this season was just one surprise to the next!

1551893,A28ATQ7TK6I71J,B008FTX6OU,Jaster Mereel,"[0, 0]","I am a big fan of the series and have been watching since the beginning.  Even if you watched the series in HD on TV you haven't truly experienced it.  The Blu-ray brings out the sound and picture to whole new levels.  Season four has darker undertones than past seasons.  The series is starting to draw closer in the timeline to Anakin's fall and the Empire's birth in Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith.The season starts off with a multi-episode story on Mon Calamari.  Decent story arc, but the highlight is a younger Ackbar, as only a General not yet an Admiral. Next they introduce the most annoying Jedi ever, General Krell, and you will dislike him intensely. Fortunately he is dealt with eventually.  This four episode story arc has a lot of battles featuring the clones and the 'Shadow People'.  A nice change from the constant droid armies although droids are included in their army to a lesser degree.  The 'Shadow People' introduce some new monstrous machines to the Star Wars universe.The second half of the season finishes strong with Obi Wan taking the guise of a bounty hunter to uncover an assassination plot involving Cade Bane.  Obi Wan undergoes extensive facial reconstruction and an implanted voice chip to alter his speech.  Apparently, in the Star Wars universe one can have massive face surgery in a matter of hours with no scars and then eventually change back rather easily a few weeks later.  Anyway, the season ends strong with the return of Darth Maul.  Darth Maul looks kind of goofy with his reconstructed body with a new spider torso.  Maul teams up with his brother Savage Opress to take revenge on Obi Wan who sliced him in half in Episode I, Phantom Menace.  Savage Opress also goes against Asajj Ventress.  Ventress has improved as a character since Dooko dropper her as apprentice as she is only looking out for he own interests.The season includes all the major characters including Grievous, Rex and other clones, R2 and C-3PO, young Boba Fett and more.

Episodes with a space battle are always the highest ranking most viewed ones.Sadly in 2012 there weren't any......in any series....what a downer.Clone Wars could have cornered the market on exciting strategic space combat. Instead we get about 42 seconds of space battle in one episode.....and thats it.Kind of MASSIVELY dissapointing.You know Star Wars is famous for its space battles, in 6 films there are 4 of them, and the others at least have a chase sequence.This series doesn't even have those.And if anyone says ""that undersea stuff was kind of like a space battle"". Feel free to compare the ending of the GIJOE film with the space battle in Mass Effect 3.The previous season had 3 episodes with space battles and season 4 tops that with 1 short one. Thats pathetic and a complete misunderstanding of what the audience wants.Don't get me wrong, it doesn't have to be all space battles. But its like a chocolate chip cookie, and the space battles are the chips.So we were sold a chocolate cookie with one small chip. Which doesn't make me want another one.TWOThe Slaves of the Republic story is COMPLETELY copied from a comic book story.
