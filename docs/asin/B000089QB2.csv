I said to myself to ask to tell me a story. I could imagine Kevin De-Kline who narrates it sitting in a classroom to read for the children and tell them this story. I would highly recommend my sister to watch this. I don't even care if it's from 4-12 year old children, I just wanted it because Kevin Kline narrates it. I heard other things and I was so surprised at some points. TV movies count as of a movie too. I saw this with my mum and she said that it was good.",5,MATD,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,573,"['love', 'Merlin', 'Dragons', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Documentary', 'Story', 'said', 'myself', 'ask', 'tell', 'story', 'could', 'imagine', 'Kevin', 'De-Kline', 'who', 'sitting', 'classroom', 'read', 'children', 'tell', 'story', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'sister', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', '4-12', 'year', 'old', 'children', 'just', 'wanted', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'heard', 'other', 'things', 'was', 'so', 'surprised', 'points', 'TV', 'movies', 'count', 'movie', 'too', 'saw', 'mum', 'said', 'was', 'good']",N/A

I had recorded MERLIN AND THE DRAGONS in the early 1990s on channel 31 which had a weak UHF signal so the picture is fuzzy on that recording. Then I spotted this title and an animated PEGASUS special on amazon.com, both at a low $8.00 and $9.00 price! Both specials I had watched on LONG AGO AND FAR AWAY and it was great to get them both with crystal clear picture and sound on the dvd format! The full hand drawn animation in MERLIN is based on the illustrations of Alan Lee who has painted lovely water colour pictures of characters from Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS and also illustrated Peter Dickenson's MERLIN DREAMS. At the beginning of this animation there is a stone in the foreground with a face on it that looks just like the stone on the cover of the MERLIN DREAMS book! In this watercolour backround style a young boy Arthur is seen speaking to an old Merlin about his nightmare in which he pulled a sword from the stone and his fears about whether he can be a good king. So Merlin then told him about about the fears and doupts of young Emris and how this boy defeated the cruel tyrant Lord Vortigan. The Alan Lee designed animation showed Emris's visions of the future that led to the release of two very dramatic flying dragons  and also how Emris used his ability to mind meld with a hawk to end the rule of this cruel tyrant! When Arthur found out who Emris really was it gave him confidence in his own ability to rule! Glad to get these specials at such a low price with great picture quality! Thank you Amazon.com!",5,Very glad to have a clear video picture of this special I had seen on a fuzzy LONG AGO AND FAR AWAY bradcast!,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,1650,"['Prices', 'sellers', 'greatly', 'vary', 'Amazon.com', ""'m"", 'always', 'glad', 'get', 'item', 'great', 'condition', 'low', 'price', 'had', 'recorded', 'MERLIN', 'THE', 'DRAGONS', 'early', '1990s', 'channel', '31', 'had', 'weak', 'UHF', 'signal', 'picture', 'fuzzy', 'recording', 'Then', 'spotted', 'title', 'animated', 'PEGASUS', 'special', 'amazon.com', 'low', '8.00', '9.00', 'price', 'specials', 'had', 'watched', 'LONG', 'AGO', 'AND', 'FAR', 'AWAY', 'was', 'great', 'get', 'crystal', 'clear', 'picture', 'sound', 'dvd', 'format', 'full', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'MERLIN', 'based', 'illustrations', 'Alan', 'Lee', 'who', 'painted', 'lovely', 'water', 'colour', 'pictures', 'characters', 'Tolkien', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'also', 'illustrated', 'Peter', 'Dickenson', 'MERLIN', 'DREAMS', 'beginning', 'animation', 'stone', 'foreground', 'face', 'just', 'stone', 'cover', 'MERLIN', 'DREAMS', 'book', 'watercolour', 'backround', 'style', 'young', 'boy', 'Arthur', 'seen', 'speaking', 'old', 'Merlin', 'nightmare', 'pulled', 'sword', 'stone', 'fears', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'king', 'So', 'Merlin', 'then', 'told', 'fears', 'doupts', 'young', 'Emris', 'how', 'boy', 'defeated', 'cruel', 'tyrant', 'Lord', 'Vortigan', 'Alan', 'Lee', 'designed', 'animation', 'showed', 'Emris', 'visions', 'future', 'led', 'release', 'two', 'very', 'dramatic', 'flying', 'dragons', 'also', 'how', 'Emris', 'used', 'ability', 'mind', 'meld', 'hawk', 'end', 'rule', 'cruel', 'tyrant', 'When', 'Arthur', 'found', 'out', 'who', 'Emris', 'really', 'was', 'gave', 'confidence', 'own', 'ability', 'rule', 'Glad', 'get', 'specials', 'low', 'price', 'great', 'picture', 'quality', 'Thank', 'Amazon.com']",N/A
