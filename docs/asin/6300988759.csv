241387,A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A,6300988759,"Bruce Gray ""gurpsgm""","[2, 4]","In this, the 79th, and concluding, episode of the Classic Star Trek series, Kirk is forced into transferring personalities with Janice Lester, a woman who has always dreamed of being a Starship Captain, but could not make the grade.And it's easy to see why the grade was never made.  Lester is very petty and cruel, and cannot handle the reins of power at all.  It doesn't take long for the crew to realize that something is very wrong with their Captain and fight to take the ship back.But the most awful part of this episode is the acting.  Shatner is at his absolute ""best"" at over emoting in this one, even taking the time to adopt a foppish girlish walk and filing his nails.  It's a miracle the almost erotic scenes of Kirk (while having Janice's personality) and Lester's boyfriend got by the NBC censors in 1968.  The scene where Kirk is forced into the personality transfer machine is almost laughable, because Kirk should have been able to overpower Lester without any trouble.  He's fought with Klingons hand-to-hand - and this woman succeeds where many far more powerful opponents fail?  Hah!A really good story of transferral of personality was almost totally ruined by the acting.My score - 5 out of a possible 10 (the slightly higher grade due to the fact that it's still ""Classic"" trek).",3,Last is not the best,1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,1303,"['79th', 'concluding', 'episode', 'Classic', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'Kirk', 'forced', 'transferring', 'personalities', 'Janice', 'Lester', 'woman', 'who', 'always', 'dreamed', 'being', 'Starship', 'Captain', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'grade.And', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'grade', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'Lester', 'very', 'petty', 'cruel', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'reins', 'power', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'crew', 'realize', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'Captain', 'fight', 'take', 'ship', 'most', 'awful', 'part', 'episode', 'acting', 'Shatner', 'absolute', 'best', 'emoting', 'one', 'even', 'taking', 'time', 'adopt', 'foppish', 'girlish', 'walk', 'filing', 'nails', 'miracle', 'almost', 'erotic', 'scenes', 'Kirk', 'having', 'Janice', 'personality', 'Lester', 'boyfriend', 'got', 'NBC', 'censors', '1968', 'scene', 'where', 'Kirk', 'forced', 'personality', 'transfer', 'machine', 'almost', 'laughable', 'Kirk', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'overpower', 'Lester', 'trouble', 'fought', 'Klingons', 'hand-to-hand', 'woman', 'where', 'many', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'opponents', 'fail', 'Hah', 'A', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'transferral', 'personality', 'was', 'almost', 'totally', 'ruined', 'acting.My', 'score', '5', 'possible', '10', 'slightly', 'higher', 'grade', 'due', 'fact', 'still', 'Classic', 'trek']",N/A
241388,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6300988759,Charles Ashbacher,"[4, 4]","Some of the best acting that William Shatner has ever done is in this episode. Many years earlier, Captain Kirk and Dr. Janice Lester had loved and then parted. He went on to captain a star ship and although she went on to a career in archeology, she remained psychotically obsessed with Kirk. In her studies, she finds a machine that is capable of transferring personalities between bodies. By arranging to have nearly all of the members of her team die of radiation poisoning, Janice Lester is able to lure the Enterprise to Camus II. She is able to get Kirk alone with her and she transfers her personality into Kirk's body and Kirk's personality into her body.They beam back to the Enterprise, where &quot;Kirk&quot; starts behaving irrationally. His facial expressions and mannerisms change, which is immediately recognized by the crew. Eventually, McCoy orders &quot;Kirk&quot; to submit to a complete set of physical and emotional tests, which reveal nothing unusual. While this is happening, Spock meets with &quot;Lester&quot; and after performing a Vulcan mine meld, Spock realizes that the transfer has occurred. &quot;Kirk&quot; is rapidly growing more irrational, &quot;his&quot; movements and speech becoming more psychotic and taking on a more feminine form. Spock is accused of treason and a hearing is convened. During the hearing, Scotty also realizes that &quot;Kirk&quot; is not right and speaks to McCoy during a recess. Their conversation is recorded and played back as &quot;Kirk&quot; accuses them of mutiny. He then sentences them to death, which then forces the remaining officers to make a decision. They refuse to follow orders and eventually the personality transfer is reversed.What makes this episode work is the acting of Shatner while Kirk is possessed by the personality of Janice. His facial features and gestures become more feminine in subtle but obvious ways and his hysteria is kept well within reasonable bounds. The scene where &quot;Kirk&quot; tries to convince her lover to kill &quot;Janice&quot; was well played, although within the strict limits of the times. Having one male touch another in a loving manner was certainly not possible in the world of network television in 1969.The weakest part of the episode is the mild way in which everyone reacts to the alleged transfer. It would have been a simple matter for &quot;Kirk&quot; and &quot;Lester&quot; to be asked questions that only James Kirk would know. Those tests would have been sufficient evidence for Dr. McCoy to temporarily relieve &quot;Kirk&quot; of his command. Nevertheless, the strong overcomes the weak and this is one of the better episodes of the final season.",4,Strong acting by Shatner as a woman in a man's body,1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,2678,"['best', 'acting', 'William', 'Shatner', 'ever', 'done', 'episode', 'Many', 'years', 'earlier', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Dr.', 'Janice', 'Lester', 'had', 'loved', 'then', 'parted', 'went', 'captain', 'star', 'ship', 'went', 'career', 'archeology', 'remained', 'psychotically', 'obsessed', 'Kirk', 'studies', 'machine', 'capable', 'transferring', 'personalities', 'bodies', 'arranging', 'have', 'nearly', 'members', 'team', 'die', 'radiation', 'poisoning', 'Janice', 'Lester', 'able', 'lure', 'Enterprise', 'Camus', 'II', 'able', 'get', 'Kirk', 'alone', 'personality', 'Kirk', 'body', 'Kirk', 'personality', 'body.They', 'beam', 'back', 'Enterprise', 'where', 'quot', 'Kirk', 'quot', 'behaving', 'irrationally', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'change', 'immediately', 'recognized', 'crew', 'Eventually', 'McCoy', 'orders', 'quot', 'Kirk', 'quot', 'submit', 'complete', 'set', 'physical', 'emotional', 'tests', 'reveal', 'nothing', 'unusual', 'happening', 'Spock', 'quot', 'Lester', 'quot', 'performing', 'Vulcan', 'mine', 'meld', 'Spock', 'transfer', 'occurred', 'quot', 'Kirk', 'quot', 'rapidly', 'growing', 'more', 'irrational', 'quot', 'quot', 'movements', 'speech', 'becoming', 'more', 'psychotic', 'taking', 'more', 'feminine', 'form', 'Spock', 'accused', 'treason', 'hearing', 'convened', 'hearing', 'Scotty', 'also', 'quot', 'Kirk', 'quot', 'not', 'right', 'McCoy', 'recess', 'conversation', 'recorded', 'played', 'back', 'quot', 'Kirk', 'quot', 'mutiny', 'then', 'death', 'then', 'remaining', 'officers', 'make', 'decision', 'refuse', 'follow', 'orders', 'eventually', 'personality', 'transfer', 'reversed.What', 'episode', 'work', 'acting', 'Shatner', 'Kirk', 'possessed', 'personality', 'Janice', 'facial', 'features', 'become', 'more', 'feminine', 'subtle', 'obvious', 'ways', 'hysteria', 'kept', 'well', 'reasonable', 'bounds', 'scene', 'where', 'quot', 'Kirk', 'quot', 'tries', 'convince', 'lover', 'kill', 'quot', 'Janice', 'quot', 'was', 'well', 'played', 'strict', 'limits', 'times', 'Having', 'one', 'male', 'touch', 'loving', 'manner', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'possible', 'world', 'network', 'television', '1969.The', 'weakest', 'part', 'episode', 'mild', 'way', 'everyone', 'alleged', 'transfer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'simple', 'matter', 'quot', 'Kirk', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lester', 'quot', 'be', 'asked', 'questions', 'only', 'James', 'Kirk', 'would', 'know', 'tests', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sufficient', 'evidence', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'temporarily', 'relieve', 'quot', 'Kirk', 'quot', 'command', 'Nevertheless', 'strong', 'weak', 'one', 'better', 'episodes', 'final', 'season']",N/A

On their way to Beta Aurigae, the U.S.S. Enterprise receives a  call for help from Camus II. The landing party finds only Janice Lester and  Dr. Coleman, who claim that the everyone else was killed by celebium  radiation. In fact, Janice is quite ill from it.  Unaware of Lester's  feelings of hatred toward him, Kirk sits with her, recalling their days  together. Kirk is suddenly trapped into a life-entity transfer with Janice.  His personality is in her body, while she takes over his, finally becoming  captain of a starship. Kirk, with Janice's essence, tries to kill her  victim, but fails. McCoy transports Janice, with Kirk's essence, to sickbay  to try and treat her illness. While Kirk, trapped in Janice's body, tries  to convince everyone that he's really the captain, Janice takes control of  the ship and diverts it to the Benecia Colony. There she plans to leave her  body, that houses Kirk's essence, thereby eliminating all her problems.  The crew becomes suspicious of her actions and, when Spock tries to  question her, she charges him with mutiny. They realize something is wrong  and Janice/Kirk is relieved of duty. When the transfer weakens and finally  breaks, Kirk returns to his body, as Janice's essence returns to hers.  Janice makes a last attempt to hurt Kirk, then collapses. Dr. Coleman, in  love with Janice, requests that he be allowed to care for her. The U.S.S.

241390,A3JB0FTLVHKN4M,6300988759,"Lily Bart ""lilybits""","[1, 4]","This final STAR TREK episode carries the crude, macho sexism of the classic series to an all-but-apocalyptic extreme. A weak, jealous woman, unable to accept the fact that men are ""naturally"" superior to women, uses an ancient alien mind transfer machine to ""take over"" the body of Captain James T. Kirk!The moral couldn't be more obvious -- even in Kirk's body, Doctor Janice Lester is weak, unstable, and in short still inferior. Kirk's loyal crew(his ""boys"")quickly guess the truth and turn on the sissified, effeminate captain (a little gay bashing thrown in with the sexism)while restoring the ""true"" captain to his rightful body. The whole thing would be really offensive if it weren't such classic camp.Ironically enough, the concept of ""Kirk in a woman's body"" could very easily have been spun the other way. Imagine Jim Kirk experiencing the humiliations of being trapped in a woman's body first hand! Next time you watch the episode, watch the scenes were the actress (with ""Kirk"" inside her) is trapped in a cell with Bones, Scotty, and the gang. Imagine Scotty drooling over the ""woman"" and copping a feel! Imagine Kirk inside the woman, feeling humiliated and demeaned, and thinking, ""gee, is this what I did to all those girls?"" It could have been explosive -- it could have been BLACK LIKE ME for feminists!Or imagine a couple of those red-shirted guards making a pass at ""Kirk"" in a woman's body -- how would ""he"" respond?

By the time they arrive, the only survivors are Dr. Coleman and Dr. Janice Lester. Dr. Lester is quite ill and cannot talk. McCoy, Spock and Coleman leave Kirk with Janice under the guise that Kirk's presence will quiet her - the two were once lovers when they attended Starfleet Academy.The bitter Dr. Lester has morphed regret into anger and seething hatred for Kirk and even hatred toward her own body as a woman. As Kirk walks across the room to investigate an alien device on the wall of the cave, the once gravely ill Lester hops out of bed and clicks what appears to be a garage door opener. Kirk is frozen against the alien device. Lester stands next to him and engages the device and we see some cheesy SFX that is unsophisticated, but to the point - Lester is transferred into Kirk's body and vice versa.Lester now feels vital and alive in Kirk's body. She picks up her former coil, now occupied by the consciousness of Kirk and lays the body back into the bed. Shatner does some of the best acting of his career as he speaks with his voice, but with a heart that is clearly not his own. Janice tells Kirk (trapped in Janice's body) that she hates being trapped in the body of a woman. That she hates Kirk and she will finally be captain of a starship thanks to the alien transferrance. The only way to ensure that the transferrance will not be reversed is to kill Kirk in Lester's body. As she attempts to strangle the neck of her former self, the footsteps of the crew are audible and she must stop.Lester has been bitter for years and the resentment has made her truly mad. As she parades around the Enterprise, more and more people are raising their eyebrows as ""Kirk"" does not seem to be himself.  Emotional tirades and other displays of chaotic behavior force McCoy to perform tests on Kirk to make sure he's ""all there.""Coleman is definitely involved, but is he being coerced? What is motivating this man to stand idly by like this - even to the point to participating in Lester's schemes at further deception. When Kirk (as Lester) is finally able to get a visit from Spock in Sickbay, a mind meld proves to Spock that it is Kirk in Lester's body and vice versa. Soon, Spock, McCoy & Scotty are in the brig, preparing for a Court Marshall against them for mutiny.For some unexplained reason, we never see Uhura in this episode - Barbara Baldavin plays the unnamed Communications Officer in Nichelle Nichol's stead.When the crazed Janice (in Kirk's body) now calls for an immediate execution of his senior officers, the entire crew is convinced that Kirk must be stopped.

Janice Lester is Kirk and Kirk is Janice Lester.Definetely, there's nothing new about that idea! Comedies have been using the idea of one character becoming another character through a brain transplant for years. The difference here is that you're supposed to know that Janice is Kirk because Janice acts rational, and you're supposed to know that Kirk is Janice because he acts like a nut case.. and also, Star Trek is not a comedy.A warning to any film producer: NEVER make an episode like this in this day and age! The lawsuits will be pouring in from BOTH political extremes. Woman's groups will sue over the film's idea that a woman in command is too irrational. Religious groups will sue because of the idea of a man and a woman trading bodies. There wouldn't be an activist group left that wouldn't sue.On the other hand, the fact that this episode crosses so many boundaries is what makes it one of the best ST episodes ever made. The director wasn't afraid to take a risk.Of all things, Shatner has to act like an irrational woman. Even little mannerisms have to be effeminate.
