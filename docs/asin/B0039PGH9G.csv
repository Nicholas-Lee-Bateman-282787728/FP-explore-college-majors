The first part of it was a bit weird, unusual, but when it got to the second part I understood how much I enjoy the movie. I didnt want to go anywhere else just to sit and wtch. In my opinion it is a different kind of a movie and the actors are great. I have no complains about nothing. It's a brilliant film. If you want to know it better then watch it yourself. i gave my opinion and I definitely don't care about haters of the movie. And I totally understand a guy who would give it a thouand stars. Im on his side. I just wonder whether there will be or possibly no second riverworld. I honestly think there will be no riverworld 2. But I so loved it.

1333879,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B0039PGH9G,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[1, 1]","There are many negative reviews of this mini-series and I began watching with some trepidation as I have read the Riverworld series of novels by Philip Jose Farmer. Perhaps because my expectations were low and because I knew the basic premise, the miniseries of Riverworld was better than I expected, even though much was changed and condensed from the series of five novels, which I recommend to any viewers who were intrigued.Humanity has been resurrected on the banks of an endless river on a planet that is clearly not Earth by creatures who remain mostly in the shadows with a mysterious agenda. Everyone who has ever lived has been resurrected or cloned into a healthy, youthful body with all of their memories up to death but nothing after. It is hinted that the Earth has finally been destroyed and no clue as to how long it has been between death and resurrection exists. Human nature is still in full force and even though food is provided and the climate is mild strong men and bullies arise and try to exploit others.In the midst of all of this, Matt is resurrected and begins looking for his fiance and for answers to the conundrum. He is accompanied by Mark Twain among others, aided by a mysterious rebel in the aliens and opposed by Richard Burton, here the villain, though a hero in the books. Burton and Matt also want the same woman, Matt's fiance, which is a complete departure from the books.I enjoyed watching Riverworld, but see how a viewer unfamiliar with the books would be confused and underwhelmed. This miniseries needed two more episodes to tell the story that Farmer told, even with the changes made for television. Enjoyable, but an opportunity to make something really interesting was missed.

1333882,A17RYD415IF0OA,B0039PGH9G,Christopher Horne,"[1, 2]","This so called 'miniseries' sounded like something that I would enjoy watching.  Ideas were supposed to come from the books Riverworld (which very well could of being has how I have not read the books I would not know).  If the movie takes some ideas from the books then I would love to read them, however if none of the ideas come from the books then I might just be wasting money.  I will still be looking into getting the books to compare the 'miniseries' to, I just hope they are better than the 'miniseries'.Okay, so enough about my rant about books.  In these two episodes that span three hours (yes I said two episodes that span three hours, three pointless hours) there is really nothing going on.  The main character Matt dies, gets reincarnated, and has to save this fictional world.  He meets up with other people who have also died and been reincarnated.The plot is there but it is severely lacking in building up of a climax, and any major detail as to why they are doing what they are doing.  The last ten minutes of the second episode just confuses one.  The first episode is dragged on, and the second episode isn't that much better.Let me go into things that I liked.  I liked the idea behind the 'miniseries'.  That is really all that I liked.Now it is time for the bad.  The historical characters seemed fake.  I mean this as to they acted differently than how I was taught in school (of course this could just be me.  I have been out of school for a while now so I could just have this idea from somewhere).  The plot was lacking, the characters acted out of character.  The main character was a complete and total waste of time.  Every twist that they try to throw into the plot just makes the movie that much worse.Again I have never read the books that go along with this 'miniseries', but if you have read the books, please by all means STAY AWAY FROM THIS 'MINISERIES'.

I believe it might have been the story that kind of threw me off as far as trying to follow the movie.  Believe me when I say that ever since I was a little boy, I have never been able to read any kind of book because I can't stand reading that small print that is in books.  This may be a bad thing for me, but I just could never sit down and read what a lot of people take for granted as far as reading a book and getting into it.  I could never do that.  I guess in order for me to experience things, I literally have to see what is going on in order to follow a particular story; I guess that's why I prefer reading comic books to reading a good book.  So this movie is good to me, but to others that I have mentioned it to; they don't like it because they say it did not follow what the author of the book intended for a movie to show.

I will say, after watching this second version, I have absolutely no interest in seeking out and reading any of his books.  This is the danger authors risk whenever they allow someone to adapt their work for the screen.I really didn't care for this production; it was (at worst) painfully dull and too long by half.  I found it to be limited in scope and a little too repetitious.  All the characters were either sad, mad, or worn weary (which I suppose comes from dying and dying and dying).

1333889,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B0039PGH9G,Gregorio,"[2, 2]","I thought this was, for the most part, pretty good.  I've never read any of the Phillip Jose Farmer novels on which this film is based (although I'm now interested enough to pick one up and give it a try).  I had seen the trailer for this SyFy channel epic and based on that and the cool looking cover art I decided to pick it up when I saw it in the store (got it dirt cheap during release week).Sometimes I like made for cable movies and I'm glad I found this one to be interesting and entertaining enough to keep me watching till the end, and I'm sure I will actually give it a few more viewings.  The reincarnation premise is fascinating, the environment is fascinating, the overall concept is intelligent and thought provoking.  Sadly, most of the characters in the film are rather dull and I never developed any real emotional connection to what was going on with them.  The performances are mostly very good, especially (and predictably) from Alan Cumming as the Judas Caretaker (who gets quite a bit of screen time in the second half of this nearly three hour film).  Leading man Tahmoe Penikett as hero Matt Ellmann is also excellent and is one of the few believable and sympathetic characters in this project.  Director Stuart Gillard keeps him shirtless for quite a while during the second hour for no apparent reason other than to show off his super ripped physique. Heros need to be hunky I guess.  Peter Wingfield as Richard Burton is fine as the chief villain.  Mark Deklin plays Samuel Clemmins and he gets some great one liners but his southern accent is pretty lame.  There are tons of other characters who come and go and perform random mysterious activities and then disappear from screen for long stretches (one supporting character just falls off the side of a mountain and no one seems to notice or care that he is never heard from again).  The narrative is often confusing and seems thrown together and events occur that are never explained.  What on earth is that room full of plants with robots tending to them?  It (like so many things in this film) is never explained or even acknowledged.  Still, as full of holes as this thing is, I enjoyed it.I thought the CGI effects were actually pretty good, especially for something on the SyFychannel.  The real star of this film is the gorgeous location photography.  This is a beautiful looking film and the high definition videography is often breathtaking.  Astoundingly beautiful.PICTURE QUALITYNo complaints from me.  Outdoor scenes are outstanding.  It looks as if you could step into the screen and be in the world.  There is a huge amount of depth in these images and the colors are realistic and never oversaturated.  Indoor scenes are mostly pretty good looking but sometimes just a wee bit soft.  One night sequence has a tiny bit of video noise but it is very slight and not distracting at all (it may even have been added as a ""grain"" effect by director Stuart Gillard since it only occurs once in a war time flashback).  At any rate I thought this had a stunning picture and I would say 95 percent of this looks entirely perfect.  I think it looks as good as a movie made for HDTV can look and I was impressed.  REALLY IMPRESSED.AUDIO QUALITYThe disc has a DTS lossless 5.1 soundtrack and I thought it sounded very good.  The film has a striking and sometimes whimsical musical score by James Guttridge that blends middle eastern, liturgical chant, classical and pop with great skill and it sounds great coming from all the speakers.  The rear speakers make fine use of ambient sounds and your subwoofer will give you a few good blasts here and there (watch out for the club explosion during the opening sequence!).  I couldn't always understand everything actors were saying but I think this is the fault of some rather poor attempts at accents than the fault of the soundtrack.

I recommend splitting this in half while watching it, though.  I only vaguely remember SciFi's earlier attempt at this story, but this new version is definitely closer to the original, for both good and bad.This miniseries was intended to be the pilot of a series, so as such, I can forgive its incompleteness.  Anything left unexplained could be covered in future episodes.  However, considering the possibility that this won't be turned into a series, they really should have explained Burton's motivations more fully.  There are a few problems with the plot, for instance: Clemens steals the boat from Pizarro.  He heads upstream towards the source of the river.  An unknown amount of time later, he meets Pizarro.  This could work if Pizarro died, came back to life upstream, and established a new kingdom, I guess, but do you buy that explanation?  Rewiring everyone's heads to speak English is, well, okay, it's cheesy, but what do you want them to do?Reagarding the actors/characters: The hero is fine, I suppose, and is appealing to the ladies.  Laura Vandervoort and the actresses playing the Japanese and Italian women are attractive, so I'll have to exempt myself from judging their acting skills.  I don't have a problem with the Caretaker aliens.  The actor playing Clemens/Twain is more of a charicature than a character.  The actor playing Burton gets a pass here, because most people don't have an idea of how Richard Burton (the 19th century British explorer, not the 20th century actor) is supposed to act.  I'm guessing the writers were told from on high ""you must have a black character and a gay character"" so they deliberately made these their weakest characters to express their resentment.Personally, I'd rather see them start all over again rather than try to turn this into a series.  X-files had its ""monster of the week"" format, Smallville had a ""meteor freak of the week,"" would Riverworld have its ""famous historical person(s) of the week?""  How long would that be interesting?  Where were they planning on going with this series?  If they had the folks behind Battlestar Galactica or Lost do this instead, the quality of the plot and acting would improve drastically, but we'd get yet another series in which there are no pure heroes or villians (which could work) and which ends with a lot of loose ends and a finale that ticks off a lot of people (which would suck).  Maybe if they stuck even closer to the books... nah, that'll never happen.2.5 stars rounded up to 3 because I'm feeling generous.",3,Enjoyable if your expectations are low,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,2683,"[""'ll"", 'shift', 'comparison', 'books', 'mini-series', 'comments', 'section', 'save', 'space.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'fun', 'entertaining', '3', 'hours', 'recommend', 'splitting', 'half', 'watching', 'only', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'SciFi', 'earlier', 'attempt', 'story', 'new', 'version', 'definitely', 'closer', 'original', 'good', 'bad.This', 'miniseries', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'pilot', 'series', 'so', 'such', 'can', 'forgive', 'incompleteness', 'Anything', 'left', 'unexplained', 'could', 'be', 'covered', 'future', 'episodes', 'However', 'considering', 'possibility', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'turned', 'series', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'explained', 'Burton', 'motivations', 'more', 'fully', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'plot', 'instance', 'Clemens', 'boat', 'Pizarro', 'upstream', 'source', 'river', 'unknown', 'amount', 'time', 'later', 'Pizarro', 'could', 'work', 'Pizarro', 'died', 'came', 'back', 'life', 'upstream', 'established', 'new', 'kingdom', 'guess', 'do', 'buy', 'explanation', 'Rewiring', 'everyone', 'heads', 'speak', 'English', 'well', 'cheesy', 'what', 'do', 'want', 'do', 'Reagarding', 'actors/characters', 'hero', 'fine', 'suppose', 'appealing', 'ladies', 'Laura', 'Vandervoort', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Japanese', 'Italian', 'women', 'are', 'attractive', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'exempt', 'judging', 'acting', 'skills', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'Caretaker', 'aliens', 'actor', 'playing', 'Clemens/Twain', 'more', 'charicature', 'character', 'actor', 'playing', 'Burton', 'pass', 'here', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'Richard', 'Burton', '19th', 'century', 'British', 'explorer', 'not', '20th', 'century', 'actor', 'supposed', 'act', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'writers', 'were', 'told', 'high', 'must', 'have', 'black', 'character', 'gay', 'character', 'deliberately', 'made', 'weakest', 'characters', 'express', 'resentment.Personally', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'start', 'over', 'again', 'rather', 'try', 'turn', 'series', 'X-files', 'had', 'monster', 'week', 'format', 'Smallville', 'had', 'meteor', 'freak', 'week', 'would', 'Riverworld', 'have', 'famous', 'historical', 'person', 'week', 'How', 'long', 'would', 'that', 'be', 'interesting', 'Where', 'were', 'planning', 'going', 'series', 'had', 'folks', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Lost', 'do', 'instead', 'quality', 'plot', 'acting', 'would', 'improve', 'drastically', ""'d"", 'get', 'yet', 'series', 'are', 'pure', 'heroes', 'villians', 'could', 'work', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'finale', 'off', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'suck', 'Maybe', 'stuck', 'even', 'closer', 'books', 'nah', ""'ll"", 'never', 'happen.2.5', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', '3', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'generous']",N/A

It is filled with bad high school amateur acting, way too many character stereotypes (black guy is always dirty, yelling and in chains and is used as nothing more than a jive talking sidekick character, Spanaird guy is cocky and barbaric for no reason, Japanese girl is silent and wise, the blond women are always wearing make up and dressed clean in J. Crew fashion whiles everyone else is dirty and wearing robes and there is the obvious evil white guy behind it all who wants to rule the world) , production looks commercial and cheap, wardrobe looks like it was supplied by Old Navy and Express. Everyone is brainwashed to speak and understand english yet someone forgot to tell the actors that a lesson in accents was required for the part because all the English-as-a-second-language accents are horrible and at times bordering on offensive. Doesn't even deserve one star!I never read the book or even saw the earlier version but this movie or TV series obviously cannot possibly add anything new or genuine to whatever Riverworld is supposed to be.I only saw it for Peter Wingfield who used to play Methos in Highlander and even a good actor such as him is wasted in this pointless TV movie.July 11th, 2010 ADDENDUM:Because of my highly negative critique from 50 minutes of viewing Riverworld, a couple of random internet fans of the show urged me to see the rest of the movie and fix my initial review.So I just watched the entire thing and I am now even more fervent about this being a really bad piece of Sci-Fi entertainment. The acting and horrible accents actually manages to get worse. The plot eventually just doesn't make any sense: Our main hero, a macho news reporter, dies in reality then wakes up in an idyllic universe where everyone is young and he can't die and he meets all his good friends and an extremely beautiful Japanese monk/warrior who for no reason befriends him and follows him around. However, our hero spends his time tracking down a woman he was dating for a few months back in reality whiles other men are tracking this woman down. The plot entails of these men using all their energy trying to kill the hero, who can't die, find his girlfriend so they can either take over or destroy the world. Some people have horses, swords and spears and some have guns and river boats, whiles some have hot air ships and bazookas for no explained reason. All the whiles God-like blue people float around, do nothing that makes sense and spurt out Yoda-like prose. I sum it up with one scene: Our hero has a Black friend that he reuinites with early on in Riverworld. The friend claims to have died 6 years after our hero died in the real world, yet this Black friend appears to be wearing the same clothes and same hair cut as he did in the scene or on the day that the hero died. This Black guy is also supposed to be the hero's best-est friend in the whole world yet when they reunite for a second or third time in Riverworld, after a heart wrenching separation, the hero barely acknowledges the Black friend. However in a proximal scene the hero reunites with the Japanese woman, whom he barely knew during his brief stay in Riverworld, after no real separation and they hug and dance and cry and cuddle and chat of old times like they were friends since birth. I won't even mention how hokey the final climax scene of this garbage is.I really would like to read the book that this is based on.

""Riverworld"" tells the story of Matt Ellerman (Tahmoh Penikett, ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Dollhouse""), a war zone journalist, as he wakes from death along the banks of a seemingly endless river where everyone who lived and died on the earth has been reborn into their youthful bodies. But what is the purpose of this place? Why has Matt been ""chosen"" by the blue-skinned alien Caretakers? Is it an afterlife or a purgatory? What *is* Riverworld?These questions and more fuel this strange journey along the banks of an endless river, populated with a lively cast of characters each with their own agenda. As Matt begins the search for his missing fiance, Jesse (Laura Vandervoort, ""V"", ""Smallville""), he runs afoul of Sir Richard Burton (Peter Wingfield) and Francisco Pizzaro, joins forces with Samuel Clemins, a.k.a. Mark Twain (Mark Deklin), and begins an epic journey along the mighty and endless river to find the source of Riverworld and find answers to his many questions.""Riverworld"" raises many questions over the course of its four hours, and not all of them are answerable. While questioning the very purpose of humanity on an alien world, ""Riverworld"" neatly dodges overloading the viewers with existential angst while providing thrilling action and fascinating glimpses into the microcosms of history that have developed along the banks of the titular river: Francisco Pizarro's conquering Spanish army and the slave camps they've set up as part of their empire, and Mark Twain's riverboat and its memorable crew draw polar opposites of the good and the bad arising in the Riverworld.The characters populating ""Riverworld"" are well-developed and flawed enough to be human. Characters darkly discuss the ""suicide express"" -- killing oneself and seeing where one ends up along the river -- and the lively slave trade that has come into existence in the forests, while Matt finds himself caught in a deadly chess game between the Caretakers as those who wish to destroy Riverworld and those who wish to save it begin a civil war fought through the human champions they've chosen, leading to a fairly disturbing torture sequence that forces Matt to question everything he knows about himself, his purpose, and his love for Jesse.All of this isn't to say that ""Riverworld"" is without fault -- while it is an original and intriguing story, many fans of Farmer's novels will be frustrated with the changes made to modernize the story. The Caretakers themselves are never satsifactorily explained, and Matt's continued quest to reunite with Jesse despite the discoveries of her dark side rearing its admittedly ugly head is fairly inexplicable. In fact, there are several aspects of ""Riverworld"" that are never truly explained, and the miniseries itself was left far too open -- while it is a possiblity that ""Riverworld"" will be developed for series, if it is not, fans of the miniseries will never recieve closure on some of the issues raised within the miniseries. Also, certain mea culpas are required: While Tamoe, a Japanese female warrior, was played rather well by Jeananne Goossen, the historical liklihood of her existence is rather slim. The deus ex machina explanation of why everyone in the Riverworld spoke English was also a bit of a ""gimme,"" though it's overlookable after a while. This incarnation of ""Riverworld"" was certainly a vast improvement over the campy 2003 production, at least.Still, Penikett capably carries much of the weight of ""Riverworld"" on his shoulders as he turns Matt into an everyman, representing all of us within himself as he is forced to question everything around him when he awakes to this strange planet. Peter Wingfield once more masterfully plays the villain of the piece, but where Burton could have been a simple ""bad guy"" he is instead a human being with motivations not entirely unsympathetic. Mark Deklin, of course, steals nearly every scene he is in as he deliciously plays Mark Twain to the hilt, and Alan Cumming is suitably mysterious as the leader of the dark side of the civil war being fought between the Caretakers.Ultimately, ""Riverworld"" was an enjoyable exploration of an intriguing world, introducing viewers to a likeable cast of characters, and the climactic and somewhat troubling finale was suitably explosive, to say the least. Never sparing on excitement and mysterious enough to keep viewers questioning, the open-ended nature of ""Riverworld"" will undoubtedly have many viewers wishing for a fully developed television series. As ""Riverworld"" doubled Syfy's viewership and broke records for miniseries premieres on weekends, it might not be a far-fetched idea.While ""Riverworld"" can, at times, be as meandering as the titular river, it is never dull, and always as flowing and exciting as any journey down the vast, mystical river can be.Four out of five stars.",4,A Fascinating Journey into a Mysterious

So when I watched the 2010 movie by Riverworld Productions / Vivendi, I was not picky about its consistency with the books. But even with vague memories of the literature, some of the inconsistencies were obvious: energized spheres instead of mushrooms, plates instead of pails, and killed persons reborn with clothes on instead of without them.I have read that this ""movie"" was supposed to be a pilot for a Sci-Fi Channel series. As pilots go, it was pretty satisfying. If I were going to write some of the episodes, the pilot allows for some powerful stories, themes, and sub-themes, with a good underlying plot. There are many mysteries to reveal and doors within doors to open.I was especially pleased with the blue-faced Caretakers, priestly characters who probably have all the answers, but are stingy with them.Regarding the movie's weakness, I do not include the above mentioned inconsistencies. In fact they were imaginative takes on Farmer's concepts. But I was pricked with questions regarding realism and logic. For example, where did Sam Clemens get his bullets? Where did Richard Burton's henchman get his rockets? Where did Sam get his cigars and whiskey? How in this wilderness world did Sam build his riverboat? We did not see a sophisticated arms factory. We did see a character making a sword, but Sam's revolver and the rockets would require more than a crude blacksmith. Nor did we see any distilleries, tobacco fields, or shipyards. We did see much of the river, riverbanks, pine trees, rocks, and mountains.I can use my own imagination to come up with possible answers as to where those, and other, objects came from, but I should not have to do that. Would the series have provided the answers?The Blu-ray version sparkles with crystal-clear images of the wilderness, and I could not complain about the sound. Some of the special effects were fine, some were poor. The acting was okay. I recognized a number of the actors and actresses, including some from Stargate SG-1, Smallville, Battlestar Galactica, and Percy Jackson & Olympians: The Lightning Thief.I subtract a star from my rating because the pilot did not result in a series. Therefore, as it stands, the pilot is a movie.
