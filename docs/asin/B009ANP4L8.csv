We never see it unwrapped (sheets) and the very few times we did see it it looked about as amaturish as you can get. Granted I'm sure they couldnt find or use a real life baby for the closeups, but still. I'm sure they wanted it to look ugly.....most babies are ha.Second: The attacks...sigh...if this were a Chucky Doll sure it makes more sense, comes alive when it chooses too and carefully kills everyone. here the baby kills everyone vampire style. The other deaths i never understood. Seems anyone who comes near the baby is possesed into killing themselves....except the sister and detective. why?The acting from the entire cast isn't bad. Some didn't do as well as others, but I think the script could take the blame on that.Some questionalble moments like the deaths in the hospital. Why wasn't the mother arrested? In reality she would have been. Second why did the mother keep the baby knowing it kills? Third, how is her sister and the detective and the creepy guy the only ones to live after coming in contact with baby?I watched the film mainly and only to see some of my favorite actress'.

These are the people that make the sort of stuff that ends up on the idiotically-named SyFy Channel - Siamese sharks, that sort of thing. In fact, from the montage of clips, I saw only one that I'd seen that was worth anything at all. Don't be gulled, it was worth very little.Anyway, woman gives birth to Devil Baby which promptly kills the two attending doctors and spends the movie trotting around LA or somewhere looking for it. It's a pretty deserted LA or somewhere, something we should note well. Baby winds up in the hands of a guy with tattoos on his face and that's about it.The body count rises in direct proportion to the temptation to turn this mess off. Rotten script, peppered with such profundities as &#34;You effing bitch&#34; (wow...) helps to anchor this awful film to the bedrock of mindlessness whence it sprang. Terrible acting and lame direction make sure that it sinks.The baby itself is an absolute horror. It's a plastic thing with no moving parts and it grows horns at the end. It goes for the jugular which means that its intended victims have to writhe and make some sort of effort to make it look like they are trying to pull the damn' thing off. Good luck with that.By the way, right at the end, the mother's t shirt is torn, exposing her boobs. When the film FINALLY grinds to a halt, it is in one piece. While we're on the subject, note the hideous boob job scars on the sacrificial victim at the start. UGH.If you watch the &#34;Extras,&#34; it's apparent that no-one involved in this has the slightest degree of self-consciousness. I can't say it's a pity because whether this had been played for laughs or not, everything about this reeks of childish amateurishness. Enough said.

1594163,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B009ANP4L8,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[9, 10]","The year 2012 sure is getting a raw deal when it comes to being associated with catastrophic events. First, we're speeding towards the end of the Mayan calendar which supposedly signifies the coming of the apocalypse. Now the Asylum marks the actual beginning of the end as ""12/12/12.""Armageddon might occur on December 21st, but the official kick-off begins on the 12th when the son of the Devil is born. At least that's what this over-the-top and completely disgusting low -budget mix of ""It's Alive,"" ""Grace,"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" wants us to believe.Baby Sebastian's birth on December 12, 2012 is marked with tragedy from the moment he arrives in the delivery room. The doctors delivering the baby are brutally and inexplicably murdered. After taking the newborn home, it becomes evident to mother Veronica that something is very wrong with her child. Death seems to surround him wherever he is. She soon realizes Sebastian is the child of Satan and will fully embrace his evil calling on December 21st.As a movie, I have to say that ""12/12/12"" isn't all that badly paced or put together. There are still the amateurish camera angles and bad acting we're all used to with the Asylum's movies. What ruins this is its mission to push the envelope of tastelessness as far as they can and get away with it. I'm all about giving the audience something shocking they can drop their jaws at, but they go way too far in my opinion.Let me give you just a few examples of sections of the film where I was looking away and closing my eyes in abhorrence. They show the demonic child coming out of the woman's private parts. You want to talk about causing someone to never want to undergo natural childbirth. Now add a highly inappropriate incestuous situation between the mother and child. Top it off with a rather graphic rape scene and you get a good idea of the sort of quality you can expect from ""12/12/12.""I love horror movies and enjoy the ""Satanic Panic"" films of the 1970s and 1980s just as much as the next fan does. I understand why the Asylum felt the need to exploit such foul matter. Many genre fans are always looking for someone to push the visual limits of gore and violence. The Asylum wanted to get those people's attention. I just think there are certain places you don't go and many of them were visited in ""12/12/12.""Movies like ""12/12/12"" make me angry. I enjoyed the idea of the movie going into it. It sounded like a fun little flick that would scare up memories of several other classic films I've appreciated. It turned out to be a completely joyless experience I found myself abhorred by. I actually turned it off and then decided to watch the entire thing so I could properly review it and warn potential viewers about it before they see anything they'll never be able to unsee.",2,"Movie Review: ""12/12/12""",1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,2800,"['year', '2012', 'sure', 'getting', 'raw', 'deal', 'when', 'being', 'associated', 'catastrophic', 'events', 'First', ""'re"", 'speeding', 'end', 'Mayan', 'calendar', 'supposedly', 'coming', 'apocalypse', 'Now', 'Asylum', 'actual', 'beginning', 'end', '12/12/12', 'Armageddon', 'might', 'occur', 'December', '21st', 'official', 'kick-off', '12th', 'when', 'son', 'Devil', 'born', 'least', 'what', 'over-the-top', 'completely', 'disgusting', 'low', '-budget', 'mix', 'Alive', 'Grace', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'believe.Baby', 'Sebastian', 'birth', 'December', '12', '2012', 'marked', 'tragedy', 'moment', 'delivery', 'room', 'doctors', 'delivering', 'baby', 'are', 'brutally', 'inexplicably', 'murdered', 'taking', 'newborn', 'home', 'evident', 'mother', 'Veronica', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'child', 'Death', 'surround', 'wherever', 'soon', 'Sebastian', 'child', 'Satan', 'will', 'fully', 'embrace', 'evil', 'calling', 'December', '21st.As', 'movie', 'have', 'say', '12/12/12', ""n't"", 'badly', 'paced', 'put', 'together', 'are', 'still', 'amateurish', 'camera', 'angles', 'bad', 'acting', ""'re"", 'used', 'Asylum', 'movies', 'What', 'mission', 'push', 'envelope', 'tastelessness', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'get', 'away', ""'m"", 'giving', 'audience', 'something', 'shocking', 'can', 'drop', 'jaws', 'go', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'opinion.Let', 'give', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'sections', 'film', 'where', 'was', 'looking', 'away', 'closing', 'eyes', 'abhorrence', 'show', 'demonic', 'child', 'coming', 'woman', 'private', 'parts', 'want', 'talk', 'causing', 'someone', 'never', 'want', 'undergo', 'natural', 'childbirth', 'Now', 'highly', 'inappropriate', 'incestuous', 'situation', 'mother', 'child', 'Top', 'off', 'rather', 'graphic', 'rape', 'scene', 'get', 'good', 'idea', 'sort', 'quality', 'can', 'expect', '12/12/12', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'Satanic', 'Panic', 'films', '1970s', '1980s', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'fan', 'understand', 'why', 'Asylum', 'felt', 'need', 'exploit', 'such', 'foul', 'matter', 'Many', 'genre', 'fans', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'someone', 'push', 'visual', 'limits', 'gore', 'violence', 'Asylum', 'wanted', 'get', 'people', 'attention', 'just', 'think', 'are', 'certain', 'places', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'many', 'were', 'visited', '12/12/12', 'Movies', '12/12/12', 'make', 'angry', 'enjoyed', 'idea', 'movie', 'going', 'sounded', 'fun', 'little', 'flick', 'would', 'scare', 'up', 'memories', 'several', 'other', 'classic', 'films', ""'ve"", 'appreciated', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'completely', 'joyless', 'experience', 'found', 'abhorred', 'actually', 'turned', 'off', 'then', 'decided', 'watch', 'entire', 'thing', 'could', 'properly', 'review', 'warn', 'potential', 'viewers', 'see', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'unsee']",N/A

I can't believe they spent money to make this.Let's forget about the fact that it's far from original. That much I expected with the slew of movies about Doomsday and evil children. With that said, why on planet Earth would these people release a movie where the baby looks absolutely awful? I mean at least try to fool us with something that could pass for a real baby. This baby looks like a monster to start with, and you mean to tell me she was surprised the baby was an offspring of the devil. Correction, the baby looks like a doll she's holding, and you can see it. They didn't even try to hide it, it was obvious, it was right there in the camera. The acting was absolutely abysmal. Again, no big shocker there. The last straw was when they showed this monster watching his so-called parents making love and in the next scene you see vulgar relations happening between this child and mother, and that's putting it nicely. I was done after that. The director had to be one sick individual to agree to tape something like that garbage. The screen-writer's were sick for writing it. I don't know what they were trying to prove, or if they were going for shock value, but they failed miserably. I don't think there's one good thing I can say about this movie. In fact, I couldn't even finish this crap, and the only reason I gave it a chance to begin with is because I have been pleasantly surprised in the past by some ""B"" rated movies.

Our ""Damien"" or Sebastian in this case is born C-section, the kind of C-section where they use no anesthetic and the mother (Sara Malakul Lane) cries in pain.Our infant, which looks like an ugly prop from a David Lynch film, was apparently inspired by the bunny in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" as he can fly around and grab people by the jugular with his long razor sharp teeth. In spite of the kid having teeth and clearing out the birthing room in a deadly fashion, mom ignores it all and opts to breast feed...ouch!12/12/12 is something that is used by a doomsday cult, most likely because my nephew born on 6/6/66 is boring and sells insurance.The detective (Steve Hanks) has a fondness for lollipops...Oh where did the writers come up with that?!This is a low budget film that goes absolutely no where. The plot doesn't flow well and is haphazard.
