The effect, though, has a down side.  Though there are a few moments of powerful drama, the movie never pauses long enough to deeply engage us in the characters' struggle to survive their loss.

The film has been so widely reviewed that the story is well known: a middle class Italian family - a psychotherapist father, a devoted mother, a teenage daughter and son - seem to have all the joy of the closely knit family of everyone's dreams.  A small kink of a minor crime by the son in this placcid life is dealt with and yet is compounded by an accidental drowning of the son.  The effect this loss has on the family, especially the father, is at once devastating but has healing resolutions.  The son's girlfriend gains entry into this grieving family and together they find the journey to recovery.  Many lessons here: how does a successful therapist cope with his own personal loss?  how does a broken family unit re-enter life? how does an unknown but extended part of the family make an impact on this grieving and become part of the healing?  All of this is told in the simplest way, photographed beautifully, and acted superbly.

709101,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00006ADG1,Gregor von Kallahann,"[9, 11]","This is only the second Nanni Moretti film that I've seen, and although I know he's known for his comedies, this and CARO DIARIO (the other film I am familiar with) tackle pretty weighty topics of death and dying, how to live in the face of death, the value of work (especially, creative work) and, well, life itself (what does it all mean? how can we make it meaningful? all the big questions).Unlike the largely autobiographical CARO DIARIO, THE SON'S ROOM is a work of fiction and therefore a little easier to deal with. It is, in fact, quite understated, as many other viewers have noted, but there are suggestions of the inner turbulence each character experiences in dealing with the sudden death of a beloved member of the family.  Each member of the immediate family has his or her moment of breakdown or dysfunction.  Yes, it's predictable enough that we KNOW they're going to get their act together somehow.  But it's just unpredictable enough that we don't know how or when or after how many setbacks.Some have commented on the Italian ""feel"" of the movie, and that difference is certainly apparent when you compare it to an American film on a similar theme, such as ORDINARY PEOPLE, say, or more recently, IN THE BEDROOM (speaking of ""room"" movies).  Both American films are powerful, emotional tours de force.  Contrary to the cultural stereotype of some perhaps, THE SON'S ROOM, is somewhat reserved in its portrait of grief.  Not every scene builds to an emotional climax.  In fact, some minor storylines, like the fossil theft, are essentially dropped in light of the larger drama that overwhelms them.  In that, this film seems actually somewhat truer to life than its American ""counterparts"" (if that's what they are).I found myself often agreeing with Darragh O'Donough's very qualified review posted above, even though his assessment of the film seems much harsher than my own.  To me, the film's strength lies, ultimately, in its understatement.  But I must admit, I will have to consider more, O'Donough's assertion that the theme of the film is more one of alienation than grief.  That's an interesting take, and it may just well be true.  Oddly enough, I'm not sure that that's the theme Moretti and team imagined they were addressing.  I'm also not sure how much that matters.Either way, THE SON'S ROOM is one to see.",4,"Meditation on Life and Death...and Grief and Love, the Works",1065830400,"10 11, 2003",2003,2342,"['only', 'second', 'Nanni', 'Moretti', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'know', 'known', 'comedies', 'CARO', 'DIARIO', 'other', 'film', 'am', 'familiar', 'tackle', 'pretty', 'weighty', 'topics', 'death', 'dying', 'how', 'live', 'face', 'death', 'value', 'work', 'especially', 'creative', 'work', 'well', 'life', 'what', 'mean', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'meaningful', 'big', 'questions', '.Unlike', 'largely', 'autobiographical', 'CARO', 'DIARIO', 'THE', 'SON', 'ROOM', 'work', 'fiction', 'therefore', 'little', 'easier', 'deal', 'fact', 'quite', 'understated', 'many', 'other', 'viewers', 'have', 'noted', 'are', 'suggestions', 'inner', 'turbulence', 'character', 'experiences', 'dealing', 'sudden', 'death', 'beloved', 'member', 'family', 'member', 'immediate', 'family', 'moment', 'breakdown', 'dysfunction', 'Yes', 'predictable', 'enough', 'KNOW', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'somehow', 'just', 'unpredictable', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'when', 'how', 'many', 'setbacks.Some', 'have', 'commented', 'Italian', 'feel', 'movie', 'difference', 'certainly', 'apparent', 'when', 'compare', 'American', 'film', 'similar', 'theme', 'such', 'ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'say', 'more', 'recently', 'IN', 'THE', 'BEDROOM', 'speaking', 'room', 'movies', 'American', 'films', 'are', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'tours', 'force', 'Contrary', 'cultural', 'stereotype', 'perhaps', 'THE', 'SON', 'ROOM', 'somewhat', 'reserved', 'portrait', 'grief', 'Not', 'scene', 'emotional', 'climax', 'fact', 'minor', 'storylines', 'fossil', 'theft', 'are', 'essentially', 'dropped', 'light', 'larger', 'drama', 'film', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'truer', 'life', 'American', 'counterparts', 'what', 'are', '.I', 'found', 'often', 'agreeing', 'Darragh', ""O'Donough"", 'very', 'qualified', 'review', 'posted', 'even', 'assessment', 'film', 'much', 'harsher', 'own', 'film', 'strength', 'ultimately', 'understatement', 'must', 'admit', 'will', 'have', 'consider', 'more', ""O'Donough"", 'assertion', 'theme', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'alienation', 'grief', 'interesting', 'take', 'may', 'just', 'well', 'be', 'true', 'Oddly', 'enough', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'theme', 'Moretti', 'team', 'imagined', 'were', 'addressing', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'matters.Either', 'way', 'THE', 'SON', 'ROOM', 'one', 'see']",N/A

Obviously it tries really, really hard to present a sensitive picture of a family dealing with the sudden death of a teenage son.Maybe it's a cultural thing.

I lost a sister in childhood and I certainly appreciate the devastation such an event has on the whole family so I am not unsympathetic to the feelings of any such family.  I think it's really the fault of the film maker. For the bulk of the film he shows us scene after scene of the family members breaking up in grief. Artistically it just doesn't work to build sympathy; it is so overdone that it turn the viewer off.In my experience life goes on, there are happy moments mixed up with sad ones and then there is the ongoing process of taking care of daily life.  This family is well off so the mother can afford to take time off of her glamorous publishing job until she feels like returning and the father, a psychiatrist, decides to quit his work altogether.

They all seem to be types, none of them elicits any genuine sympathy from the viewer.

This movie to me was comparable to American television movies where something terrible happens to a family and how they cope with it. It was an Italian film, but on the whole it was of the same viewing quality as these movies, maybe a little less slick in appearance.Also some of the scenes were so banal. Like just before the boy drowns a sense of danger is created by the girl on the moped kicking one of her friends on another moped, the close passing of a truck as the father drives to his patient etc. Or when the boys' casket is nailed shut and is screwed shut interchanged with images of the mourning father. How fat can you lay it on?Especially the beginning of the movie is excruciating. A very one-dimensional portrait of the family, if they were black, they would be called the Huxtables.

First routine and happiness, the second chaos and sadness.The above are just some things I noticed about the movie which didn't make sense to me. I won't even go into the storyline which is rather unplausible at some points even though it is completely predictable. What bothers me most though is that all of this must have been done on purpose, but why? The end result is a bland film which may have been made with a lot of care, but just doesn't come across. This is the first movie I have seen by this director. I have heard that his other movies are better. I hope so, because this film hasn't made a great impression on me.",1,Based on a true story,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,1610,"['was', 'surprised', 'ending', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'above', 'caption', 'beginning', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'comparable', 'American', 'television', 'movies', 'where', 'something', 'terrible', 'family', 'how', 'cope', 'was', 'Italian', 'film', 'whole', 'was', 'same', 'viewing', 'quality', 'movies', 'maybe', 'little', 'less', 'slick', 'appearance.Also', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'banal', 'just', 'boy', 'sense', 'danger', 'created', 'girl', 'moped', 'kicking', 'one', 'friends', 'moped', 'close', 'passing', 'truck', 'father', 'patient', 'etc', 'when', 'boys', 'casket', 'nailed', 'shut', 'screwed', 'shut', 'interchanged', 'images', 'mourning', 'father', 'How', 'fat', 'can', 'lay', 'Especially', 'beginning', 'movie', 'excruciating', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'portrait', 'family', 'were', 'black', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'Huxtables', 'course', 'offset', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'first', 'First', 'routine', 'happiness', 'second', 'chaos', 'sadness.The', 'above', 'are', 'just', 'things', 'noticed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'storyline', 'rather', 'unplausible', 'points', 'even', 'completely', 'predictable', 'What', 'most', 'though', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'purpose', 'why', 'end', 'result', 'bland', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'lot', 'care', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'across', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'director', 'have', 'heard', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'hope', 'so', 'film', ""n't"", 'made', 'great', 'impression']",N/A

Moretti plays Giovanni, a successful psychoanalyst who has a seemingly idyllic family life.  His gorgeous wife works in the art world, his daughter is a bright student-athlete, his teenaged son often gives up time with friends in order to pal around with old dad, and the family sings along with the radio when they take weekend jaunts to enjoy the beautiful Italian scenery.  They're almost like an Italian Brady Bunch.  However, their happiness unravels when the family encounters a life-changing tragedy.I had mixed feelings about ""The Son's Room.""  I definitely appreciated the realistic portrayal of a family facing a crisis.  In particular, the movie keeps histrionics to a minimal yet allows each character's grief to be fully explored.  Perhaps the most intriguing part of ""The Son's Room"" was the intertwining of Giovanni's work as a psychoanalyst and his difficulties working through his grief.  As he attempts to find some sense of meaning to the tragedy and a feeling of closure, his work with his clients suffers and he begins to experience counter-transference.  Some of these scenes are quite interesting and add something new to this genre.  On the other hand, the movie's odd tone kept the characters at a distance, making their reactions somewhat cryptic at times.  Moretti's acting was particularly off-putting to me; I'm not sure what he was going for during several scenes, but I had the impression that he simply is not a good enough actor to pull off this complicated role.The film won the coveted Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival - the first Italian entry to do so since ""The Tree of Wooden Clogs"" (1978).  Notably, it beat out ""Mullholland Dr."" for the award, despite the popularity of David Lynch with the Cannes crowd.  ""The Son's Room"" is a solid, above-average family drama, although I thought it was a tad ordinary for a Palme d'Or winner (I would have voted for ""Mullholland Dr."" or even ""The Man Who Wasn't There"").  I'm glad I viewed the film, but it didn't make me want to seek out more of Moretti's work.",4,"""For one thing after other will grow clear.""",1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,2121,"['Nanni', 'Moretti', 'directs', 'stars', '2001', 'Italian', 'film', 'Son', 'Room', 'Moretti', 'Giovanni', 'successful', 'psychoanalyst', 'who', 'seemingly', 'idyllic', 'family', 'life', 'gorgeous', 'wife', 'works', 'art', 'world', 'daughter', 'bright', 'student-athlete', 'teenaged', 'son', 'often', 'up', 'time', 'friends', 'order', 'pal', 'around', 'old', 'dad', 'family', 'sings', 'radio', 'when', 'take', 'weekend', 'jaunts', 'enjoy', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'scenery', ""'re"", 'almost', 'Italian', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'However', 'happiness', 'unravels', 'when', 'family', 'life-changing', 'tragedy.I', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Son', 'Room', 'definitely', 'appreciated', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'family', 'facing', 'crisis', 'particular', 'movie', 'histrionics', 'minimal', 'yet', 'character', 'grief', 'be', 'fully', 'explored', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'intriguing', 'part', 'Son', 'Room', 'was', 'intertwining', 'Giovanni', 'work', 'psychoanalyst', 'difficulties', 'working', 'grief', 'find', 'sense', 'meaning', 'tragedy', 'feeling', 'closure', 'work', 'clients', 'suffers', 'experience', 'counter-transference', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'add', 'something', 'new', 'genre', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'odd', 'tone', 'kept', 'characters', 'distance', 'making', 'reactions', 'somewhat', 'cryptic', 'times', 'Moretti', 'acting', 'was', 'particularly', 'off-putting', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'several', 'scenes', 'had', 'impression', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'actor', 'pull', 'off', 'complicated', 'role.The', 'film', 'won', 'coveted', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'first', 'Italian', 'entry', 'do', 'so', 'Tree', 'Wooden', 'Clogs', '1978', 'Notably', 'beat', 'out', 'Mullholland', 'Dr.', 'award', 'popularity', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Cannes', 'crowd', 'Son', 'Room', 'solid', 'above-average', 'family', 'drama', 'thought', 'was', 'tad', 'ordinary', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'winner', 'would', 'have', 'voted', 'Mullholland', 'Dr.', 'even', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'glad', 'viewed', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'seek', 'out', 'more', 'Moretti', 'work']",N/A
