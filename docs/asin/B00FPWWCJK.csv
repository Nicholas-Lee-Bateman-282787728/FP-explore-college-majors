1672667,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00FPWWCJK,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","We received this movie as part of the Film Movement series.  We've encountered a lot of unexpected, small-wattage international gems that way - 'Teddy Bear' from Denmark as a notable example.  &#34;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow&#34; was another pleasant surprise.  We'd seen the trailer, which frankly seemed to reduce expectations.  But the film experience itself easily surpassed those. Writer/director Arvin Chen has come up with a small gem here.And, for anyone with a fear of 'foreign' film who thinks they won't relate to something from Taiwan: Chen was born and raised in California, attended USC, wrote the first drafts of the film in English.  The themes he explores here are universal and transportable across cultures.Leads Richie Ren (Wei-chung) and Mavis Fan (Feng) are likable presences.  Fan's background as a singer is put to good use here in the neat dream-like sequence that gives the film its title.I really liked Kimi Hsia as Wei-chung's little sister, Mandy - beautiful eyes, comedic delivery, involved in what I thought was the film's neatest trick: imaginary repartee with the star of a maudlin love story who has jumped off the screen and to her side as she wallows in abject self-pity during a pre-wedding break-up. Sounds treacly. It's not. Writer/director Chen plays it for a spot of fun and gets the tone of it exactly right than to Ms. Hsia.  We need to see more of her.",4,Another winning international film brought our attention courtesy of Film Movement,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,1401,"['received', 'movie', 'part', 'Film', 'Movement', 'series', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'lot', 'unexpected', 'small-wattage', 'international', 'gems', 'way', ""'Teddy"", 'Bear', 'Denmark', 'notable', 'example', '34', 'Will', 'Still', 'Love', 'Me', 'Tomorrow', '34', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', ""'d"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'frankly', 'seemed', 'reduce', 'expectations', 'film', 'experience', 'easily', 'surpassed', 'Writer/director', 'Arvin', 'Chen', 'come', 'up', 'small', 'gem', 'here.And', 'anyone', 'fear', ""'foreign"", 'film', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'relate', 'something', 'Taiwan', 'Chen', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'California', 'attended', 'USC', 'wrote', 'first', 'drafts', 'film', 'English', 'themes', 'here', 'are', 'universal', 'transportable', 'cultures.Leads', 'Richie', 'Ren', 'Wei-chung', 'Mavis', 'Fan', 'Feng', 'are', 'likable', 'presences', 'Fan', 'background', 'singer', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'here', 'neat', 'dream-like', 'sequence', 'film', 'title.I', 'really', 'liked', 'Kimi', 'Hsia', 'Wei-chung', 'little', 'sister', 'Mandy', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'comedic', 'delivery', 'involved', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'film', 'neatest', 'trick', 'imaginary', 'repartee', 'star', 'maudlin', 'love', 'story', 'who', 'jumped', 'off', 'screen', 'side', 'abject', 'self-pity', 'pre-wedding', 'break-up', 'treacly', 'not', 'Writer/director', 'Chen', 'spot', 'fun', 'tone', 'exactly', 'right', 'Ms.', 'Hsia', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'her']",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?

When it ends, there are several obvious paths the continuation could have taken, both happy and sad. Yet, the viewer should concentrate on the movie itself and the deep emotional undercurrents that cannot be denied, no matter how hard the people try.Weichung is an optometrist that has been married to Feng for nine years and they have an adorable young boy. Feng is in her late thirties and understands that if they are to have another child it must be soon and so she raises the issue with Weichung. The reaction is not what she expected, for Weichung has run into an old gay friend named Stephen at his sister's engagement party. That meeting rekindles the suppressed gay tendencies that Weichung possesses and he seriously questions his marriage and the life path that he has selected. Stephen has found what for him is an ideal solution, he has married a lesbian so both of them are free to pursue their true sexual feelings while being socially acceptable.Weichung's world is further complicated by his sister's questioning of her impending marriage. They have just announced their engagement when his sister comes to him to say that she now realizes that the marriage is not what she wants. Meanwhile, Feng recognizes Weichung's emotional turmoil, which is enacted at a very low level. There is no dramatic scene of emotional confrontation between Weichung and Feng, where he is forced to make a choice as to what path he is going to take. Other complications include Weichung and Feng receiving significant work promotions that give them both significantly more responsibility.The understated yet deeply felt emotional turmoil within Weichung is what makes this movie the gem that it is. He knows what he is yet he is still deeply devoted to his son and in a real sense loves his wife. The uncertainty at the end is fitting, given the obvious lack of clear path within the mind of Weichung. I think another five minutes of action where he makes a decision would have degraded the movie and the scene involving Weichung's boss giving up control of the store and leaving was a stroke of genius.",5,A gem with an ambiguous ending,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,2228,"['are', 'person', 'stories', 'have', 'clear', 'resolution', 'end', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'disappoint', 'When', 'are', 'several', 'obvious', 'paths', 'continuation', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'happy', 'sad', 'viewer', 'should', 'concentrate', 'movie', 'deep', 'emotional', 'undercurrents', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'people', 'try.Weichung', 'optometrist', 'been', 'married', 'Feng', 'nine', 'years', 'have', 'adorable', 'young', 'boy', 'Feng', 'late', 'thirties', 'are', 'have', 'child', 'must', 'be', 'soon', 'so', 'issue', 'Weichung', 'reaction', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'Weichung', 'run', 'old', 'gay', 'friend', 'named', 'Stephen', 'sister', 'engagement', 'party', 'meeting', 'suppressed', 'gay', 'tendencies', 'Weichung', 'possesses', 'seriously', 'questions', 'marriage', 'life', 'path', 'selected', 'Stephen', 'found', 'what', 'ideal', 'solution', 'married', 'lesbian', 'are', 'free', 'pursue', 'true', 'sexual', 'feelings', 'being', 'socially', 'acceptable.Weichung', 'world', 'further', 'complicated', 'sister', 'questioning', 'impending', 'marriage', 'have', 'just', 'announced', 'engagement', 'when', 'sister', 'say', 'now', 'marriage', 'not', 'what', 'Meanwhile', 'Feng', 'Weichung', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'enacted', 'very', 'low', 'level', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'emotional', 'confrontation', 'Weichung', 'Feng', 'where', 'forced', 'make', 'choice', 'what', 'path', 'going', 'take', 'Other', 'complications', 'include', 'Weichung', 'Feng', 'receiving', 'significant', 'work', 'promotions', 'give', 'significantly', 'more', 'responsibility.The', 'understated', 'yet', 'deeply', 'felt', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'Weichung', 'what', 'movie', 'gem', 'what', 'yet', 'still', 'deeply', 'devoted', 'son', 'real', 'sense', 'wife', 'uncertainty', 'end', 'fitting', 'given', 'obvious', 'lack', 'clear', 'path', 'mind', 'Weichung', 'think', 'five', 'minutes', 'action', 'where', 'decision', 'would', 'have', 'degraded', 'movie', 'scene', 'involving', 'Weichung', 'boss', 'giving', 'up', 'control', 'store', 'leaving', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius']",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?
1672669,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00FPWWCJK,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow is a tender character study. The subject matter could have gone a dark difficult direction; instead it was handled in a wonderful manner. It isn't a cute quirky romantic story the cover art suggests, instead it is an hour and forty minutes spent with several unusually complex characters.The central conflict is the question of love and homosexuality, within the boring routine of day to day life. And yet this film appears mainstream, it is non-judgmental; things are the way they are because they are just that way. There are dream sequences that appear seamlessly. In one scene, the lead character is riding on the train, this is the third or fourth time we have seen the exact same opening sequence on the train. The new cut is to the train car full of handsome young men. At first I didn't notice all the men, the director held the shot long enough to finally notice. He cuts back to the lead character and then back to the train interior full of men and women. These dream sequences are so beautifully done.The film is presented in Taiwanese with English subtitles. The film was shot in an extra wide format, wider than 16:9; there are letterbox bands above and below the film. The film is not rated. There is no nudity. Homosexuality is a central theme of the film. There is some strong language in the subtitles. Mature younger viewers should be able to watch this film.I loved this film.The bonus short is by the same director. The 12 minute film had to be a test bed for some of the things done in Will You Love Me Tomorrow. The short is a wonderful sweet film about a guy that works in a noodle stand. It is a sweet tender film.I was provided a review copy.",5,Tender,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,1700,"['Will', 'Still', 'Love', 'Me', 'Tomorrow', 'tender', 'character', 'study', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'dark', 'difficult', 'direction', 'instead', 'was', 'handled', 'wonderful', 'manner', ""n't"", 'cute', 'quirky', 'romantic', 'story', 'cover', 'art', 'instead', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'spent', 'several', 'unusually', 'complex', 'characters.The', 'central', 'conflict', 'question', 'love', 'homosexuality', 'boring', 'routine', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'yet', 'film', 'mainstream', 'non-judgmental', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'are', 'just', 'way', 'are', 'dream', 'sequences', 'appear', 'seamlessly', 'one', 'scene', 'lead', 'character', 'riding', 'train', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'exact', 'same', 'opening', 'sequence', 'train', 'new', 'cut', 'train', 'car', 'full', 'handsome', 'young', 'men', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'men', 'director', 'held', 'shot', 'long', 'enough', 'finally', 'notice', 'back', 'lead', 'character', 'then', 'back', 'train', 'interior', 'full', 'men', 'women', 'dream', 'sequences', 'are', 'so', 'beautifully', 'done.The', 'film', 'presented', 'Taiwanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'extra', 'wide', 'format', 'wider', '16:9', 'are', 'letterbox', 'bands', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'nudity', 'Homosexuality', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'strong', 'language', 'subtitles', 'Mature', 'younger', 'viewers', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'film.I', 'loved', 'film.The', 'bonus', 'short', 'same', 'director', '12', 'minute', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'test', 'bed', 'things', 'done', 'Will', 'Love', 'Me', 'Tomorrow', 'short', 'wonderful', 'sweet', 'film', 'guy', 'noodle', 'stand', 'sweet', 'tender', 'film.I', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'copy']",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?
1672670,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B00FPWWCJK,John D. Cofield,"[1, 1]","This Taiwanese film with English subtitles tells two interconnected stories.  Weichung is a businessman in his late thirties, married to a very pretty woman named Feng.  They have a young son, and all appears to be going well for them except that Weichung has a vague feeling of unhappiness or discontent. That comes to a head when Weichung's sister Mandy, who is engaged to Sen Sen, hires Stephen as her engagement photographer.  Stephen, it turns out, is an old friend of Weichung, and he immediately wants to rekindle the gay relationship the two had had years earlier.  At first Weichung rejects Stephen, but as the film goes on we see his own doubts and those of Feng, Mandy, and Sen Sen grow as they question their commitments to each other.Despite the serious nature of the main story line, this is a film with some light hearted moments that suggest the ultimate fates of the main characters will be happy.

1672672,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00FPWWCJK,Paul Allaer,"[4, 4]","Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies, and that I am a subscriber to their DVD-of-the-Month club. This movie is in fact the December '13 release in that on-going series.&#34;Will You Still Love me Tomorrow?&#34; (2013 release from Taiwan; 106 min.) focuses on two couples. As the movie opens, we get to know Feng and her husband Weichung, a couple in their late thirties with a young son. We see them getting ready for another routine day (Feng has an office job, Weichung works in a Lenscrafters-style eyeglasses retail store). Soon thereafter we are introduced to the second couple, consisting of Weichung's younger sister Mandy and her fianc&eacute;. The couples' stories are intertwined to a degree, but are fueled by two events: on the one hand Fend is once again bringing up the issue of planning for another baby with Weichung, and on the other hand Mandy is overcome with fear that she made the wrong choice, both as to her husband-to-be and her lifestyle if she were to marry. Will these couples be able to resolve their problems? To tell you more of the plot-heavy storyline would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second full-length feature from American-Taiwanese director Arvin Chen. It is clear that Chen has a nose for finding a good story that brings a new (or at least: different) perspective. The pressure, direct and indirect, that the couples feel, both from their immediate families (parents, in particular) and society as a whole, to conform to a certain expected 'family unit' and/or lifestyle, is suffocating. Second, if you wonder about the movie's title, yes it is indeed the Shirelles tune (Fang sings it at a karaoke-dinner party one evening with co-workers). Third, be sure to check out the 10 min. interview with Arvin Chen in the DVD bonus materials, as he gives great insight on certain aspects of the movie that will otherwise escape you. Last but not least, as is always the case, the Film Movement DVD contains a bonus shortie, in this case Chen's debut as a writer-director, the 13 min. &#34;Wei&#34; (from 2006), in which a teenage boy is in love with the daughter of a noodle stand owner but struggles to express his love. Well worth watching!Bottom line: I really enjoyed this movie, even though (or perhaps because of) its bittersweet undertones about life in general, and love relationships in particular. As a result, &#34;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?&#34; is another great addition to the ever-growing Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies.
