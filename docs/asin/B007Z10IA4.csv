For those thinking it may be something like Being Human, it misses the mark by a mile. The first series is awful and would never have bothered to keep watching had I not already purchased both series. Happily, the second series is better, with tighter and more cohesive stories. They got rid of the leads from the first and it generally works better all round, but is overall a huge disappointment.",3,Well not up to usual British standard,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,509,"['Not', 'sure', 'new', 'approach', 'shows', 'Brits', 'Tried', 'true', 'always', 'best', 'where', 'are', 'concerned', 'thinking', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'Being', 'Human', 'mark', 'mile', 'first', 'series', 'awful', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'bothered', 'keep', 'watching', 'had', 'not', 'already', 'purchased', 'series', 'Happily', 'second', 'series', 'better', 'tighter', 'more', 'cohesive', 'stories', 'got', 'rid', 'leads', 'first', 'generally', 'better', 'round', 'overall', 'huge', 'disappointment']",Bedlam: Series 2

I've never seen a show where the whole cast is replaced, it's just strange. Something I've noticed with British shows is that they kill off the main characters almost always. I don't know if its to shock and awe their audience or if the production companies just can't hold onto their actors, either way, it makes for bad t.v. Definitely won't be watching anymore Bedlam.",1,"A whole new cast, really?",1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,495,"['finished', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'Bedlam', 'instantly', 'bought', 'season', 'two', 'Low', 'behold', 'entire', 'cast', 'been', 'replaced', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'where', 'whole', 'cast', 'replaced', 'just', 'strange', 'Something', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'British', 'shows', 'kill', 'main', 'characters', 'almost', 'always', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'shock', 'awe', 'audience', 'production', 'companies', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'onto', 'actors', 'way', 'bad', 't.v', 'Definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'anymore', 'Bedlam']",Bedlam: Series 2
