E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I actually wanted to give the Groomsmen a rating of 3 out of 5 stars but then I realized (like an hour into it) that I wasn't ignoring the majority of the pointless arguments taking place between all the characters as much as I initially thought.The storyline is honestly just a bunch of 30-something year old immature guys preparing for a wedding.  Among the group are two brothers, and two friends.Throughout the film we find out about each of the guys, how they grew up, their many secrets, and how they are preparing for the upcoming wedding.  The most obvious problem is that, as I mention above- there's nothing but one argument after another taking place between the friends, so while watching the movie you might feel like you're slowly becoming immature yourself!Interesting approach not focusing on the actual wedding though.  I also wish Brittany Murphy would have received a bigger role.  She was basically pushed in the background so the guys could be the main center of attention.There's also a LOT of swearing taking place- be prepared for that.  Swearing, immature characters, and a storyline that's basically nothing but a big party scene involving numerous drunk arguments and a weak attempt to form a rock band and perform music together.  That about sums it up... and I liked it, haha.  I'd definitely understand if someone really despised a film like this, though.  Honestly a good portion of the storytelling is nonexistent, but there you have it.",4,barely a 4 star film,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,1469,"['actually', 'wanted', 'give', 'Groomsmen', 'rating', '3', '5', 'stars', 'then', 'realized', 'hour', 'was', ""n't"", 'ignoring', 'majority', 'pointless', 'arguments', 'taking', 'place', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'initially', 'thought.The', 'storyline', 'honestly', 'just', 'bunch', '30-something', 'year', 'old', 'immature', 'preparing', 'wedding', 'group', 'are', 'two', 'brothers', 'two', 'friends.Throughout', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'guys', 'how', 'grew', 'up', 'many', 'secrets', 'how', 'are', 'preparing', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'most', 'obvious', 'problem', 'mention', 'above-', 'nothing', 'one', 'argument', 'taking', 'place', 'friends', 'so', 'watching', 'movie', 'might', 'feel', ""'re"", 'slowly', 'becoming', 'immature', 'Interesting', 'approach', 'not', 'focusing', 'actual', 'wedding', 'also', 'wish', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'bigger', 'role', 'was', 'basically', 'pushed', 'background', 'guys', 'could', 'be', 'main', 'center', 'attention.There', 'also', 'LOT', 'swearing', 'taking', 'place-', 'be', 'prepared', 'Swearing', 'immature', 'characters', 'storyline', 'basically', 'nothing', 'big', 'party', 'scene', 'involving', 'numerous', 'drunk', 'arguments', 'weak', 'attempt', 'form', 'rock', 'band', 'perform', 'music', 'together', 'sums', 'up', 'liked', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'understand', 'someone', 'really', 'despised', 'film', 'though', 'Honestly', 'good', 'portion', 'storytelling', 'nonexistent', 'there', 'have']",The Groomsmen
1015618,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000HRMAVS,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 4]","The Groomsmen is a movie about growing up and dealing with the facts of life as one approaches the thirty- something years. This movie features Edward Burns who stars, directs, and wrote this movie. He plays Paulie, a man who is more stable than the guys he has chosen for his wedding party but who starts to fall apart as his wedding day draws nearer. He is starting to wonder whether or not he should really get married and talking to his brother and friends only complicates matters. He is starting to doubt how he feels even though, deep down inside, his feelings are true. It appears to be an instance of cold feet but it is up to Paulie to figure this out and he has only seven days to come to his senses.Each of the five friends/family in this movie has some sort of personal problem/issue and this forms the basis of the film. The guys are a little juvenile at times and a little abrasive at others. They are outspoken and yet they have a difficult time expressing certain personal concerns. This basically sums up what the movie is all about. It isn't a goofy slapstick comedy about a guy and his wedding party. In fact, there are no actual wedding scenes relating to the movie until the end when the credits roll. This is actually a movie about family matters, friendship, confession, reconciliation, and acceptance.This movie is part comedy and part drama with the bulk of the time spent on serious moments and emotional trauma. I watched this film hoping for some comedy but I wasn't disappointed with what I got. The Groomsmen is generally a serious movie and I admit I wasn't impressed when I started to view it. At first, it appeared to be an annoying waste of time with a bunch of guys drinking away their problems, allowing their tempers to flare at each other, and trying to reconnect with their younger days. The film slowly takes shape near the end when the pieces start to fall into place.Performances in this film are nice and those who view will likely find someone they can relate to. Emotions run high in this movie, whether it's an adrenaline- fueled outburst or a personal moment between one of the guys and his wife. And the guys and girls in this movie are effective in conveying these emotions. Ironically, Edward Burns himself might be the least acceptable of the cast. His Paulie character is a little stiff and Burns performance is nothing exceptional. But he is still adequate and the support he gets from those around him easily compensate for his own blandness.The Groomsmen isn't a film that will appeal to everyone. The primary audience for this movie is thirty something males and the women who live with them. The movie seems a little shallow at first and I know that some viewers will be turned off by the constant cussing and the physical fighting. But I must give Edward Burns credit for taking what looked to be a hodgepodge of a film and turning it into a worthwhile piece of entertainment with a messages that ring clear: Communicate, be honest, and let others know how you feel. Don't wait until tomorrow to get something off your chest. Be true to yourself and let your feelings be known. Too much waiting and you could miss out on some of the best years of your life.",3,Thirtysomething Men Facing Mid Life Crises,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,3216,"['Groomsmen', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'dealing', 'facts', 'life', 'one', 'thirty-', 'something', 'years', 'movie', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'who', 'directs', 'wrote', 'movie', 'Paulie', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'stable', 'guys', 'chosen', 'wedding', 'party', 'who', 'fall', 'apart', 'wedding', 'day', 'nearer', 'starting', 'wonder', 'not', 'should', 'really', 'get', 'married', 'talking', 'brother', 'only', 'matters', 'starting', 'doubt', 'how', 'feels', 'even', 'deep', 'down', 'inside', 'feelings', 'are', 'true', 'be', 'instance', 'cold', 'feet', 'Paulie', 'figure', 'out', 'only', 'seven', 'days', 'come', 'senses.Each', 'five', 'friends/family', 'movie', 'sort', 'personal', 'problem/issue', 'basis', 'film', 'guys', 'are', 'little', 'juvenile', 'times', 'little', 'abrasive', 'others', 'are', 'outspoken', 'yet', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'expressing', 'certain', 'personal', 'concerns', 'basically', 'up', 'what', 'movie', ""n't"", 'goofy', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'guy', 'wedding', 'party', 'fact', 'are', 'actual', 'wedding', 'scenes', 'relating', 'movie', 'end', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', 'actually', 'movie', 'family', 'matters', 'friendship', 'confession', 'reconciliation', 'acceptance.This', 'movie', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'drama', 'bulk', 'time', 'spent', 'serious', 'moments', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'watched', 'film', 'hoping', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'what', 'got', 'Groomsmen', 'generally', 'serious', 'movie', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'when', 'started', 'view', 'first', 'appeared', 'be', 'annoying', 'waste', 'time', 'bunch', 'guys', 'drinking', 'away', 'problems', 'allowing', 'tempers', 'flare', 'other', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'younger', 'days', 'film', 'slowly', 'shape', 'end', 'when', 'pieces', 'start', 'fall', 'place.Performances', 'film', 'are', 'nice', 'who', 'view', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'someone', 'can', 'relate', 'Emotions', 'run', 'high', 'movie', 'adrenaline-', 'fueled', 'outburst', 'personal', 'moment', 'one', 'guys', 'wife', 'guys', 'girls', 'movie', 'are', 'effective', 'conveying', 'emotions', 'Ironically', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'might', 'be', 'least', 'acceptable', 'cast', 'Paulie', 'character', 'little', 'stiff', 'Burns', 'performance', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'still', 'adequate', 'support', 'easily', 'compensate', 'own', 'blandness.The', 'Groomsmen', ""n't"", 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'primary', 'audience', 'movie', 'thirty', 'something', 'males', 'women', 'who', 'live', 'movie', 'little', 'shallow', 'first', 'know', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'constant', 'cussing', 'physical', 'fighting', 'must', 'give', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'credit', 'taking', 'what', 'looked', 'be', 'hodgepodge', 'film', 'turning', 'worthwhile', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'messages', 'ring', 'clear', 'Communicate', 'be', 'honest', 'let', 'others', 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'tomorrow', 'get', 'something', 'chest', 'Be', 'true', 'let', 'feelings', 'be', 'known', 'Too', 'much', 'waiting', 'could', 'miss', 'out', 'best', 'years', 'life']",The Groomsmen

One of the chief frustrations in watching his films is the casting implausibilities and unrealistic situations he puts his characters through. This film thankfully did not have those problems and it really was entertaining to watch through.Minor points but they somewhat bothered me............#1 if the characters are all 33-35 and Jay Mohr has a 2006 inspection sticker in his window, these characters were between ages 6-8 when Loverboy's ""Turn me Loose"", Eddie Money's ""Shakin'"" and Marshall Crenshaw's ""Someday, Someway"" were playing on the radio, which means 1980-1982. I didn't get the connection as to why this particular music meant anything to these characters who were 6-8 at the time.#2..........if you tell me in the script that the Brittany Murphy character is pregnant and this is the reason for the impending wedding, does she need to hold her stomach in every single ensuing scene to reminds us she is pregnant? Watch for this and it will drive you crazy as you watch her scenes. I just didn't understand the need for her to be holding her belly in every single scene she was in this movie.We get it, she's pregnant.But again, I think Edward Burns refound his way here and this was an enjoyable movie to watch.

1015621,A2KU5RUDF2VO80,B000HRMAVS,J. Kenney,"[13, 14]","I Just reviewed LOOKING FOR KITTY, Ed Burns' other neglected 2006 release.  This is the finer film (That one is OK, too), a very plausible slice-of-life looking at a group of mid-thirties guys looking at their lives when one, Burns, is getting married (to Brittany Murphy, who has prominence on the cover, and is important, but secondary to the male leads).  It's well-tread territory, but Burns has an excellent supporting cast (John Leguiziamo, Jay Mohr, Donnell Logue and Matthew Lillard, who gives his best performance to date) and doesn't force things; there are several well-played scenes where the actors get to do their thing.The state of theatrical film release in 06 is such that this crowd-pleaser barely got out of New York and L.A., which is a shame; in a summer of overheated overpriced Hollywood flicks it was a nice change of pace.  Of course, the dvd box has that ""REAL GENIUS/ MODERN LOVE what where they thinking?"" photoshop quality -- Burns is never seen wearing that ridiculous shirt at any time in the movie (it looks like its 1985 and he's going to the Flock of Seagulls concert or something), nor does he ever carry her on his shoulders like that.  The theatrical poster showed the five guys in a bar having a drink, and that should've stayed the cover, as it didn't mislead the viewer.  The film is a comedy, but it's not a WEDDING CRASHERS comedy, definitely more of a meeting of BIG CHILL or RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN with THE BREAKFAST CLUB.
