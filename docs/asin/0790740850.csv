While part of this movie does have to do with boxing, it is just a vehicle to better show the audience deep character changes happening inside the heart and mind of the lead character, P.K. (called Peekay in the book, apparantly, although I never read it). The director deserved any awards that were lying about when he made this film!The story is about a small British boy, P.K., who is orphaned at a young age and lives in an all-Afrikaans boarding school. He is harrassed and beaten, and eventually comes under the tutilage of 'Doc', an eccentric and wise old man from Germany. When Doc is taken to prison, he is treated exceptionally well, and introduces P.K. to Piet, a black inmate who teaches the small boy to box. In this way P.K. grows up, witnessing tragic and terrible happenings around him as well as triumph as he outrgrows his thin, scared figure and becomes a muscular, self-confident and strong-willed man. The film follows him as he grows as a human being, striving to change his world and live life to its fullest. The story is one without flaws, and although is a bit unbelievable (I don't think this is a true story; however, it very well might be) it is very convincing.The preformances are exellent, the best of which is definitely from Stephen Dorff, who plays P.K. His accent is wonderful considering I'm almost sure he's American. Mueller-Stahl as Doc is obviously spectacular, as always, and the acting of Morgan Freeman, who plays Piet... well, I needn't say more! The story is deeply stirring, sending literal chills down my spine as I watched. While the flakish, yet spunky, character of Maria (P.K.'s sheltered love interest who matures more with him then I think she would have otherwise in her entire lifetime) is played well, her character seems to be there simply to add a love story to an already fabulous film. The romance is quite touching, however, and is a nice distraction from the chaos of P.K.'s world.A film not to be missed.",5,"Gorgeous, Stirring Film",1000252800,"09 12, 2001",2001,2113,"['Not', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'director', 'quot', 'Rocky', 'quot', 'quot', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'quot', 'two', 'well', 'done', 'rather', 'shallow', ""'fighting"", 'movies', 'part', 'movie', 'have', 'do', 'boxing', 'just', 'vehicle', 'better', 'show', 'audience', 'deep', 'character', 'changes', 'happening', 'heart', 'mind', 'lead', 'character', 'P.K', 'called', 'Peekay', 'book', 'apparantly', 'never', 'read', 'director', 'deserved', 'awards', 'were', 'lying', 'about', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'story', 'small', 'British', 'boy', 'P.K.', 'who', 'orphaned', 'young', 'age', 'all-Afrikaans', 'boarding', 'school', 'harrassed', 'beaten', 'eventually', 'tutilage', ""'Doc"", 'eccentric', 'wise', 'old', 'man', 'Germany', 'When', 'Doc', 'taken', 'prison', 'treated', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'introduces', 'P.K', 'Piet', 'black', 'inmate', 'who', 'small', 'boy', 'box', 'way', 'P.K', 'up', 'witnessing', 'tragic', 'terrible', 'happenings', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'triumph', 'thin', 'scared', 'figure', 'muscular', 'self-confident', 'strong-willed', 'man', 'film', 'human', 'being', 'striving', 'change', 'world', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'story', 'one', 'flaws', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'true', 'story', 'however', 'very', 'well', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'convincing.The', 'preformances', 'are', 'exellent', 'best', 'definitely', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'who', 'P.K', 'accent', 'wonderful', 'considering', ""'m"", 'almost', 'sure', 'American', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'Doc', 'obviously', 'spectacular', 'always', 'acting', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'Piet', 'well', 'need', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'story', 'deeply', 'stirring', 'sending', 'literal', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'watched', 'flakish', 'yet', 'spunky', 'character', 'Maria', 'P.K', 'sheltered', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'more', 'then', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'entire', 'lifetime', 'played', 'well', 'character', 'be', 'there', 'simply', 'add', 'love', 'story', 'already', 'fabulous', 'film', 'romance', 'quite', 'touching', 'however', 'nice', 'distraction', 'chaos', 'P.K', 'world.A', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

Like most novels, it's a pretty big hunk of fiction.  One of the reasons why the work of hack SF writer Phillip K. Dick gets made into so many movies (apart from the fact that he's as much the darling of the MLA as he is the object of old-line science fiction fannish contempt) is that he wrote lots of short fiction - novelettes and novellas*** -- and the average movie script really can't encompass more of characterization, detail and plot than is contained in a novelette.If you're a screenwriter or a producer, you can't expect to pack into a two-hour movie every character and plot element of a novel exactly as written.  Even the bladder-busting *Lord of the Rings* and *Harry Potter* movies don't do that.Frankly, when I saw *The Power of One* I was disappointed to discover that the guard sergeant who murdered Geel Piet *didn't* die the slow agony of metastatic cancer (as framed in the novel) instead of enjoying the quick and relatively painless off-stage fate of simply getting found hanged by the neck in Geel Piet's cell.  Shucks.But I knew enough to live with my disappointment, and that means I can enjoy this movie *AND* the novel, each as an example of good art.  If the best revenge is living better than the boob who offends you, let's take it as given that I'm enjoying perfect vengeance on the most oafish of my predecessors on this site.Take that, you clods.--------------*** SFWA defines a novelette as being between 7,500 and 17,499 words -- between short story and novella length -- while the novella is defined as running from 17,500 to 39,999 words.  40,000 words and more is by their definition a novel.",5,"Cinema is a different medium, damnit...",1072051200,"12 22, 2003",2003,1909,"['silly', 'boogers', 'who', 'gripe', 'how', 'film', ""n't"", 'wholly', 'recapitulate', 'novel', 'need', 'length', 'two-by-four', 'applied', 'briskly', 'head', 'shoulders', 'necessary', 'distraction.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'one', 'folks', 'who', 'read', '*The', 'Power', 'One*', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'most', 'novels', 'pretty', 'big', 'hunk', 'fiction', 'One', 'reasons', 'why', 'work', 'hack', 'SF', 'writer', 'Phillip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'apart', 'fact', 'as', 'much', 'darling', 'MLA', 'object', 'old-line', 'science', 'fiction', 'fannish', 'contempt', 'wrote', 'lots', 'short', 'fiction', 'novelettes', 'average', 'movie', 'script', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'encompass', 'more', 'characterization', 'detail', 'plot', 'contained', 'novelette.If', ""'re"", 'screenwriter', 'producer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'pack', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'character', 'plot', 'element', 'novel', 'exactly', 'written', 'Even', 'bladder-busting', '*Lord', 'Rings*', '*Harry', 'Potter*', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'that.Frankly', 'when', 'saw', '*The', 'Power', 'One*', 'was', 'disappointed', 'discover', 'guard', 'sergeant', 'who', 'murdered', 'Geel', 'Piet', ""*didn't*"", 'slow', 'agony', 'metastatic', 'cancer', 'framed', 'novel', 'instead', 'enjoying', 'quick', 'relatively', 'painless', 'off-stage', 'fate', 'simply', 'getting', 'found', 'hanged', 'neck', 'Geel', 'Piet', 'cell', 'Shucks.But', 'knew', 'enough', 'live', 'disappointment', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'novel', 'example', 'good', 'art', 'best', 'revenge', 'living', 'better', 'boob', 'who', 'let', 'take', 'given', ""'m"", 'enjoying', 'perfect', 'vengeance', 'most', 'oafish', 'predecessors', 'site.Take', 'clods.', '***', 'SFWA', 'novelette', 'being', '7,500', '17,499', 'words', 'short', 'story', 'novella', 'length', 'novella', 'defined', 'running', '17,500', '39,999', 'words', '40,000', 'words', 'more', 'definition', 'novel']",N/A

(Guy Witcher, Simon Fenton, Stephen Dorff) - short for Peter Phillip Kenneth Keith - is a British lad in South Africa who lands in an Afrikaans boarding school after his parents fall ill.  Given the era and immigration pattern, the school is attended heavily by Nazi regime supporting German children who are disdainful of P.K. and eager to unleash torture - particularly from the oldest student - which would likely destroy the average child's psyche.Luckily P.K. is resilient, and supported by a series of mentors who help mold him into a young man of strong will, courage, intelligence and strength necessary to battle the evils of Apartheid.  Initially he is sent to live with his uncle's friend Doc (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a famous German pianist who opens P.K.'s eyes to the world, exposing him to the wonders of nature and molding his reasoning skills.  Through unfortunate circumstances, Doc is incarcerated but he's treated more like a respected guest.  As a result, P.K. not only gets freedom of movement, but also to learn from another wise man, Geel Piet (Morgan Freeman).  Under Piet's tutelage, P.K. grows into a boxing champion who, as the result of myths and his grasp of various African languages, holds significance to the future of united South African tribes.I have not read the book, so the best that I can say is that the tragedies displayed, the outcomes and lessons learned, are monumentally profound and impeccably filmed.  Each difficulty faced and overcome brings a viewer closer to not only the protagonist, but also his plight.  I clenched my fists in support when P.K. boxed; I hummed in unison when the chants of thousands propelled him on.Obviously, the acting in this film is superb.  Each version of P.K. is perfect for eliciting the appropriate emotion (e.g. sympathy for the youngest, strength the eldest).  Freeman and Mueller-Stahl are wonderful as always, and probably could serve as wise advisors in real life.  A few other characters provide spunk and life to various aspects of the story, but the surprise of the film is a young Daniel Craig as the brutal Sgt. Botha, a man with a grudge against P.K.I'd be remiss if the soundtrack wasn't mentioned.  Quite possibly the most powerful soundtrack ever recorded, each note evokes emotion the likes of which I've never experienced so consistently within a movie.  Even without the film, the African hymns, chants, and orchestral pieces would be considered inspirational.  Legendary Hanz Zimmer should be applauded.A hero's journey, The Power of One is about the ability of internal strength to influence others towards a common goal, creating a unified ""Power of One.""

Virtually unknown to the viewing audience thanks to release errors made when the movie came out in 1992, the story provides a showcasefor the acting talents of Stephen Dorff - then a virtual unknown, today one of our strongest young character actors; he stars as Peekay, a young English orphan torn by the promise of an easier future outside of his native South Africa and his love for all things and most people of his land.  He is drawn by his past and the lessons learned from a series of wise mentors, who see in him the promise and hope of a better future for South Africa.  Color blind, he grows up speaking many tribal languages, and is foreign only to the politically powerful movement that created the system of Apartheid in South Africa.Power of One was recommended to me by a dear friend, who said the movie inspired him in many ways.  He was so right.  The music, a mixture of soaring melodies and tribal songs, inspires on its own.  The scenic beauty of the land of South Africa, from the grasslands to the waterfalls is breathtakingly portrayed on film and captured with true artistry in the DVD.There are many fine supporting players in this tale, some famous, some unknown.  Like most tales of heroes and leaders, they shine for awhile in the tale of the child, the adolescent and then the young man Peekay (kudos to the casting director for the two youngsters who play Peekay in his early years; they light up the screen!) and each one's sun sets as Peekay lives through the losses and tragedies that form the backdrop for most heroes.Really a fine tale - a little long in the last hour, some gratuitous violence - a story of the African struggle that few of us know was taking place while the world watched the Nazis.If you see the Power of One, and are moved by the story, be sure to read Courtenay's novel.

But it is in a harsh labor prison where he learns he can make a difference to the Natives there.

108340,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0790740850,Only-A-Child,"[4, 6]","John Avildsen could be considered the most interesting director of his generation if only for the huge range of quality among his films and the fact these differences seem to have little correlation with his level of experience.  His best films include Joe (one of his first efforts), Rocky (several years later), and this film (late in his career).  Mixed in between these high points are some moderate successes (Lean on Me and Save the Tiger) and some total dogs (Neighbors, The Karate Kid, WW and the Dixie Dance Kings, and Rocky V).  It is hard to believe that it was same person, you either have to credit Avildsen with the ""courage"" to take on even the most hopeless of scripts or with such financial desperation that he had to take anything that came his way.With Avildsen the ""courage"" angle (willing to attempt something without fear of failure and able to bounce back after failure) is the more likely, since courage is the recurring theme of most of his films: the solitary individual pitted against the oppressive and dehumanizing forces of the ""status quo"".This is certainly true of ""The Power of One"".  Bryce Courteney's book had that same theme and the film adaptation preserved it.  Critics of the adaptation (and lovers of the book) complain that this is about the only thing that Avildsen preserved.  While they are technically correct, their complaints are rather silly because the book(s) were basically un-filmable (at least commercially) and film is a different medium making comparison illogical anyway.  While all adaptations contain many elements of a story, there will be omissions and changes-particularly with a novel like Courteney's.  Those who complain that this adaptation was incomplete and inaccurate probably complained that ""Clueless"" was an inaccurate adaptation of Jane Austin's ""Emma"".  The point is that a movie is a movie and a book is a book.Actually this film was a blending of Courteney's story with Stephen Covey's ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" with the main character having to move from dependence to independence (private victory) before he can become effectively interdependent (public victory) and influence others. Despite an ending showing this public victory, the theme is really more interior in its meaning.This is a more political story than the novel but the political elements are superficial and simplistic.  And the premise of a white boy leading a whole race of people to their salvation is a bit over the top, an unnecessary and forced way of extending Courteney's individual inner power to a collective unity.  But such is the nature of film, where pacing considerations and time constraints make reliance on stereotypes necessary to economically convey a message.  And in a sweeping historical story like this there is no way to provide a great deal of depth to the characters.  But Avildsen does a good job with his main character, a consistent style of frequent reaction shots of PK remind the viewer that the film is entirely his point-of-view and his impressions as he grows up.  The solitary individual pitted against an oppressive power structure, his ""power of one"" being an ability to experience personal tragedy/inhumanity and yet retain his humanness, a child who does learns to not let fear restrict the experience of living.What makes the film good is that while Avildsen's political message is heavy-handed and stereotyped, he makes good use of the time this buys him for other story elements.Some have asked why Fay Masterson's ""Maria"" character was added to the screenplay (Maria was not in Courteney's novel).  This was a special subtle touch by Avildsen.  Masterson is as perfect looking as Nicole Kidman but somehow much more real.  Two of the best visual scenes in the film revolve around her character.  The first is PK's initial glimpse of Maria in the audience at his championship fight (homage to Rocky's search for Adrian in the crowd).  It is visually amazing-Masterson has an angelic glow in this shot which makes PK's instant enthrallment and improbable pursuit seem quite believable.  And Masterson handles the subtle acting requirements of this difficult role extremely well, representing those Afrikaners who were able to overcome their childhood indoctrination, see their racist institutions for what they were, and work for change.  The other key scene is Maria's funeral where Avildsen shows her father's sudden grasp of what a special person she was, and special for the very qualities he tried to suppress in her while she was still alive.  This scene could have been clumsy and silly but Avildsen stages it with such subtlety that we accept that her father has been inspired to work for reform.  Film is such a powerful medium because when done correctly it can visually tell a story in a few seconds more convincingly than in a hundred pages of text.Bottom line this is not a perfect movie nor is it an accurate adaptation of the book.  It is a very entertaining film more ""inspired"" by the book than adapted from it.  It has great visuals of the veldt and has wonderful African music.  The historical subject is worth telling and the individual themes of justice, hope, and courage offer a very positive message.Then again, what do I know?

PK, an English boy is cared for by his Zulu nanny and as a young child starts to learn and respect the ways of the tribes in South Africa.  When he gets a little older he sent to a Africaaner boarding school where he is the only English boy and is the object of the worst kind of bullying there.  He is urinated on and subject to some of the worst kinds of humilation that the other boys can come up with.His nanny takes him to a medicine man who helps him find the courage within and gives him a pet chicken.  Jaabie, the worst of the bullies, has his chicken hanged.  It is there that he learns through experience what it is like to be the object of predjudice and to be hated not based on who a person is but based on something that is only a small part of who they are, like where they come from. Ultimately after Jaabie tries to hang PK upside by the feet and throw stones at him and a teacher catches Jaabie, Jaabie is expelled.Later on when PK's mother dies he goes to live with his grandfather.  PK meets a German pianist, Doc and they connect.  Doc takes PK under his wing and gains even more respect and liking for the black people in South Africa.  After WWII Doc is imprisoned but the warden allows P.K. to visit him and he also allows Doc to keep a cactus garden and piano in his cell.  Doc becomes dismayed that PK's grades aren't very good and finds out that smart kids are bullied in PK's school.  Doc asks one of the black prisoners, Geel Piet, to help PK.  Geel Piet teaches PK to box.  PK begins to see more and more how the black people in South Africa are so horribly treated.  Geel Piet teaches PK to think first with the head and then with the heart.  P.K. becomes the prisoners' unofficial letter writer and he treats everyone the same and they call him the ""Rainmaker"" which is kind of like calling him a hope giver and peace maker at the same time.  P.K. organizes a kind of concert where unbeknownst to the warden the prisoners are singing about how badly they're treated and hope.  When Geel Piet reveals this to the warden, he kills Geel Piet.After the war is over Doc goes back to Germany.  PK ends up gettting a scholarship to a prestigious school and becomes one of the boxing champions there.  He meet, Maria, an Africaaner girl, and they start dating, in secret because he father doesn't approve, because he is one of the leading intellectuals and might soon become the head of the South African government.  PK goes to one of the local townships and boxes against the local black champion, Gideon.  Gideon loses but he and PK become friends in the process. PK and Maria decide to start teaching English to the local black populations of these townships.There is a big raid where Maria gets killed.  PK and Jaabie have it out one last time.

PK is about to give up until Gideon shows him how much good he has done by teaching people English.

It has been one of my favorites for years.I found out about the book by catching a scene of the film on HBO, namely the prison concert scene. I was moved and had to read the book.i have never seen anything besides that one scene until now.I found the film  distracting.  Namely the child actors who played PeeKay (the teenager, not the very young child.)  It was so bad I had to turn the film off.I found it the constant narrative of the cyhild over what was happening very distracting especially as the book is written as a retrospective, and as beautiful as the line is ""the Lonliness birds layed big stone eggs in my heart.."" it sounds a little sophisticated coming from a five year old.I was also disappointed to see major sections of the book cut out - in particular the train ride where PeeKay meets Hoppie Groenwald, the boxer who dubs the child the next welter weight champion of the world..I think if the film had simply followed a chronological  manner, itwould have been better. i didn't like being told what was happening. i prefer storytelling in which i am allowed to discover the mysteries as well.  And it needed more of the original story.  that and the irritating teenage actor bugged the heck out of me.so if havent read the book, then you're probably fine.  but if you have, don't rent the film or buy it.  go back and read it again...(three stars because Morgan freeman is in it, and because i love the book)",3,disappointed,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,1463,"['First', 'off', 'i', 'love', 'LOVE', 'book', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'years.I', 'found', 'book', 'catching', 'scene', 'film', 'HBO', 'namely', 'prison', 'concert', 'scene', 'was', 'moved', 'had', 'read', 'book.i', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'one', 'scene', 'now.I', 'found', 'film', 'distracting', 'Namely', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'PeeKay', 'teenager', 'not', 'very', 'young', 'child', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'turn', 'film', 'off.I', 'found', 'constant', 'narrative', 'cyhild', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'very', 'distracting', 'especially', 'book', 'written', 'retrospective', 'as', 'beautiful', 'line', 'Lonliness', 'birds', 'layed', 'big', 'stone', 'eggs', 'heart..', 'little', 'sophisticated', 'coming', 'five', 'year', 'old.I', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'see', 'major', 'sections', 'book', 'cut', 'out', 'particular', 'train', 'ride', 'where', 'PeeKay', 'Hoppie', 'Groenwald', 'boxer', 'who', 'child', 'next', 'welter', 'weight', 'champion', 'world..I', 'think', 'film', 'had', 'simply', 'followed', 'chronological', 'manner', 'itwould', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'being', 'told', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'i', 'prefer', 'storytelling', 'i', 'am', 'allowed', 'discover', 'mysteries', 'well', 'needed', 'more', 'original', 'story', 'irritating', 'teenage', 'actor', 'bugged', 'heck', 'me.so', 'havent', 'read', 'book', 'then', ""'re"", 'probably', 'fine', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'film', 'buy', 'go', 'back', 'read', 'again', 'three', 'stars', 'Morgan', 'freeman', 'i', 'love', 'book']",N/A

This is a story about a small boy who was not only raised by his mother, but a sweet mammy also, who after his mother took ill, had to leave his home, his mother, his mammy and best childhood friend at a tender young age, without no one to direct him until he meets his mother's friend, who winds up raising P.K. until the Nazi's arrest them for being at the wrong place at the wrong time. There, P.K. meets the character played by Morgan Freeman, who I might add, is an excellent actor. They become fast friends and he soon starts to teach P.K. how to box. As P.K. grows up, he becomes well known by the Africans who are also in the same prison, and they look up to P.K. for some freedoms and safety. I can't tell you anymore, you just have to see it for yourself. The African music sung in this movie is beautiful, and enjoyed by all.

I re-watch it frequently and enjoy it every time.After seeing the film, I tried the book but found it too muddy and long-winded to be worth the effort to finish.  It was, I think, Courtenay's first book and half-autobiographical as well, which is never a good combination because of the temptation to throw in everything but the kitchen sink.Although I didn't like the book, it wasn't because I expected it to be like the film!  I didn't like the book because I don't like long books that aren't written very well.  (I didn't like books 6 and 7 of the Potter series, either, and for the same reason.  Ditto Jean Auel's books 5 and 6.)Both the film and the book are ""growing-up"" / ""coming-of-age"" stories, but the film is allegorical rather than (semi-)autobiographical.The film shows 7 vignettes, separated by heartbreaking losses, from the life of an Anglo-South-African boy, covering the period from his birth in 1930 to the official imposition of Apartheid in 1948.1) Persecution at an Afrikaner school for being a ""rooinek"" (redneck), an Afrikaner term for Anglo-Africans.  The Afrikaners were the original European invaders of southern Africa in the 17th century, mostly from the Low Countries and France; Afrikaans can be considered a dialect of Dutch.  The English invaded later;2) An introduction to life, music, and learning by a world-class German concert pianist, 'Doc', who serves as a father-figure to PK;3) The realisation, when the English authorities imprison Doc at the start of WW2 simply for being German, that the Afrikaners aren't the only ones who can be cruel and stupid;4) An introduction to self-defence and self-confidence through boxing by Geel Piet ('Yellow Pete'), a Cape-Coloured (mixed-race) prisoner (brilliantly portrayed by Morgan Freeman, as he always does);5) An introduction to resistance and freedom-in-the-heart, when PK, Doc, and Geel Piet collude to supply the Black prisoners with tobacco, and then when they create a double-edged entertainment at the end of WW2, nominally for the prison authorities but really by and for the prisoners themselves;6) The realisation that not all Afrikaners are like his Nazi tormentor at school, Jaapie Botha, or the psychopathic prison guard Sgt. Bormann.  This comes in two stages, first when he sees the Afrikaner owner of a boxing gym, Hoppie Gruenwald, treating everyone equally regardless of color, and then when he falls in love with a privileged Afrikaner girl, who turns out not to share the White supremacist views of her professor father.7) The realisation that in unity there is strength, and that staying in South Africa to help work for ""a good tomorrow"" for everyone is a better use of his life than going to England and studying at Oxford for a conventional career.There are several Black African actors in the film and every one of them is excellent except for the poor little kid who got stuck with the almost-non-role of Tonderai (the son of PK's nanny and his 'best friend').  He's so bewildered and ignored that it's painful to watch!Four of the African actors had significant individual speaking parts (Nanny (Nomadlozi Kubheka), the medicine man Debula Manzi (Jeremiah Mnisi), the boxing promoter Elias Mlungisi (Winston Ntshona), and PK's buddy/second lead Gideon Duma (Alois Moyo).  Only Ntshona and Moyo seem to be professionals, judging by what can be found on the web.The camera work is very fine, especially in the dreamy images of the landscape and countryside.The music is a special part of the film.  None of the songs are especially traditional --nearly all were written, or at least adapted, for the film, I believe-- but as always the choral call-and-response singing is impossibly beautiful.",5,It is a FILM.
