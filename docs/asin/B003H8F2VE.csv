However, this was a good Christmas movie worth adding to my collection.  The story is funny, and most of the original cast is back.  For the most part, the cast changes are good ones.  I can't really think of any that made me think the change runied the movie.  Most of the original elves are back as well.Unlike some of the other movies from ABC ""Family"" that have come out at Christmas, such as Holiday in Handcuffs, this movie is actually enjoyable and okay for the entire family.  ABC did not try to forward their liberal / statist agenda with this movie.
