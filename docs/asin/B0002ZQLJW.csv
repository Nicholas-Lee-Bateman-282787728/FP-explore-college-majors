We have been studying the history of theologians and it is often enlightening to see how it is put into film.  Of course, we understand that there are enhancements, but based upon what I know about John Wesley and his method of study and teach, the movie does well.

It did not set him up on an altar as someone that he was not, neither did it throw him into the gutter to &#34;humanize&#34; (as we call it today) him in corrupt ways that he did not take (I've seen other documentaries that tried to be more &#34;relevant&#34; by doing that).To my knowledge, this movie stays very close to his diary and attempts to be very accurate to history.And, a huge plus, the acting is NOT PAINFUL in anyway, which is sometimes the case in these old religious documentary dramas.Well worth it!
