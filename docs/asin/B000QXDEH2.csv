1078099,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B000QXDEH2,Amanda Pike,"[26, 28]","I just started watching the show Jekyll on BBC America and I have to say it's the greatest version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde I have EVER seen.  It's so good I had to start watching more episodes from a British friend because I noticed there were some cuts made to the version that aired on BBC America.  Hyde is like a hyper active and malicious child who enjoys tormenting things and though is capable of love doesn't admit to it or understand it.  In a way his psychotic hyper activity reminds me of Drew Sarich's portrayal of Armand in the Lestat musical.Hyde, at one point, saves Dr. Jackman's (Jekyll) children when one of them is put in a lion's cage in a zoo.  He claims he only did it to kill a lion.  Later when Hyde is ranting 'They're not my family they're HIS family' someone threatens Jackman's wife and Hyde asks 'Are you threatening my family?'  and when the man says yes Hyde promptly slits his throat.  You don't know if you should be repulsed or pity this child-like sadist.Hyde has a warped sense of humour, listening to Disney show tunes and at one point singing The Lion Sleeps tonight after slaughtering a lion in a zoo.  It's dark. It's funny.  It's suspenseful.Now, I don't usually like Jekyll and Hyde stories but this is the best version I have ever seen and James Nesbitt (Jackman and Hyde) does the best duel roles I have ever seen where you really almost think they really are two different men even though the physical changes are subtle compared to most Jekyll and Hyde transformations.I love this.

The script also puts some intriguing twists on Robert Louis Stevenson's original story while still retaining its main themes and tensions. In fact, Jekyll was well on its way to becoming one of the best TV programs I've ever seen until the last couple of episodes. No spoilers here, but I was disappointed with some moments in episode 5, which got a bit slap-sticky and a bit full of itself, and I did not like how the series as a whole ended in episode 6.

There are subtle differences in the way that this show was produced, compared to a typical U.S. show- not necessarily better or worse, just different. There is a tremendous amount of attention given to the details of the program, including the suspenseful music and the excellent pacing of the miniseries. Each episode is essentially a small mystery, tying into the larger story arc of Jekyll and Hyde. Once I started watching, I was hooked, and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. This was an interesting, engaging, modern take on the classic tale of Jekyll and Hyde. The way that the core of the classic story was worked into a contemporary setting was effective and intelligent, retaining a hint of its supernatural origins, but also taking the opportunity to explore the duality of man.What really sets ""Jekyll"" apart, however, is the outstanding performance by James Nesbitt as ""Dr. Jackman"" (Jekyll and Hyde). I had never heard of him before I watched this show, but I can say without reservation that he is one of the most talented actors I have ever had the pleasure of watching. He brings the dual roles of Jekyll and Hyde to life. He is utterly convincing as the dual personalities, transforming from the timid intellectual into the aggressive, confident monster that lives within- with no CGI, makeup, or special effects.

Nothing prepared me for Nesbitt's outstanding performance in this updated Robert Louis Stevens' ""Dr. Jekyll Mr.  Hyde"" with cell-phones and the latest's technology for Jekyll (he's called Tom Jackman in this 2007 version)and Hyde's use even allowing for Hyde and Jackman (Jekyll) to be in contact with each other via a cell phone--marvelous touch!  Nesbitt playing of both roles is stupendous.  There are times; I thought there were different actors for each role.  Nesbitt even appears different physically in both roles.  His performance is a ""tour de force""; Nesbitt is simply brilliant.Having read Stephen's novel and having seen many films of' ""Dr. Jekyll Mr.  Hyde"", I was completely ""blown away"" by this 2007 version that is outstandingly written by Steven Moffat and directed by Douglas Mackinnon.  It is at one moment extremely funny (especially Hyde in a very morbid and scary way)and at the next moment very scary.  Hyde is really a most frightening creature.  All of the acting is really tremendous in ""Jekyll"".  I also adored the sub-plot involving a secret organization that is keeping a ""close eye"" on Hyde to see just how he ""works"" and being behind his very creation for the orgznization's benefit-- the organization contains a bunch of very  violent and nasty characters that are willing to do anything to get Hyde including feeding Jackmann's son to wild lions.  I remained very "" glued"" to my TV all through this production.

An old, old tale is completely redesigned to the modern world, more than one century later. No descendents he had that dear Doctor Jekyll since he died a virgin. But Mr. Hyde had a lot of descendents, because he was no virgin indeed, particularly with the maid of the family. And the very classic doppelganger living inside you, me, or anyone is back on track for one more series of adventures. Of course we are no longer in a jingoistic village society when London was a loose network of big villages and New York one big hamlet in America. So the state and private interests that want to take control of the world are tracking, tracing and hunting the descendent, Dr Jackman. One of the two will have to die, Dr Jekyll or Mr. Hyde. One has a family, wife and twin boys, one Jekyll and one Hyde of course. They, the bad ones, both military and mercenary, try to capture Dr Jekyll in order to turn Mr. Hyde into a super - killing? - machine that could be used in some shadowy and dark business. They had tried to clone the man but that never succeeded, so they want the real man. But Mr. Hyde is a monstrous super-person or superman and it takes more than one bullet to kill him. Dr Jackman is weak of course but he is protected by his doppelganger who will try not to share the damage. That idea has often been used in horror literature by Anne Rice, Stephen King, Clive barker, and quite a few more. But here we are slowly, at times too slowly, moving to a dramatic end that has to be de-dramatized if there is to be a sequel one day.  But the best part of this series is not only the creative plot or intrigue, but also the great acting of these TV actors, who are not only TV actors, far from it. That's what is best with BBC programs: they use ""normal"" actors that act ""normally"", that is to say very well, and it is a pleasure to watch the episodes that never become humdrum and habitual. It is a very British syndrome: actors work both and equally well for TV and the cinema, and at times the stage. You can very well see an actor in a series tonight, in a theater in Charring Cross Road on the following night and in some cinema on the third night. And that actor, or actress, will be just as good in the three locales. So, what about the next season since we know now this doppelganger-ism can be carried by women and can be invested in twins? We are longing for the next series of six episodes, let's say ten years later.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",5,"Once you like it, twice you love it",1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,2671,"['BBC', 'series', 'are', 'rejuvenating', 'when', 'compared', 'standard', 'series', 'have', 'elsewhere', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'European', 'markets', 'old', 'old', 'tale', 'completely', 'redesigned', 'modern', 'world', 'more', 'one', 'century', 'later', 'No', 'descendents', 'had', 'dear', 'Doctor', 'Jekyll', 'died', 'virgin', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'had', 'lot', 'descendents', 'was', 'virgin', 'indeed', 'particularly', 'maid', 'family', 'very', 'classic', 'doppelganger', 'living', 'anyone', 'back', 'track', 'one', 'more', 'series', 'adventures', 'course', 'are', 'longer', 'jingoistic', 'village', 'society', 'when', 'London', 'was', 'loose', 'network', 'big', 'villages', 'New', 'York', 'one', 'big', 'hamlet', 'America', 'state', 'private', 'interests', 'want', 'take', 'control', 'world', 'are', 'tracking', 'tracing', 'hunting', 'descendent', 'Dr', 'Jackman', 'One', 'two', 'will', 'have', 'die', 'Dr', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'One', 'family', 'wife', 'twin', 'boys', 'one', 'Jekyll', 'one', 'Hyde', 'course', 'bad', 'ones', 'military', 'mercenary', 'try', 'capture', 'Dr', 'Jekyll', 'order', 'turn', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'super', 'killing', 'machine', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'shadowy', 'dark', 'business', 'had', 'tried', 'clone', 'man', 'never', 'succeeded', 'want', 'real', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'monstrous', 'super-person', 'superman', 'more', 'one', 'bullet', 'kill', 'Dr', 'Jackman', 'weak', 'course', 'protected', 'doppelganger', 'who', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'share', 'damage', 'idea', 'often', 'been', 'used', 'horror', 'literature', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Clive', 'barker', 'quite', 'few', 'more', 'here', 'are', 'slowly', 'times', 'too', 'slowly', 'moving', 'dramatic', 'end', 'be', 'de-dramatized', 'be', 'sequel', 'one', 'day', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'creative', 'plot', 'intrigue', 'also', 'great', 'acting', 'TV', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'TV', 'actors', 'far', 'what', 'best', 'BBC', 'programs', 'use', 'normal', 'actors', 'act', 'normally', 'say', 'very', 'well', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'episodes', 'never', 'become', 'humdrum', 'habitual', 'very', 'British', 'syndrome', 'actors', 'work', 'equally', 'well', 'TV', 'cinema', 'times', 'stage', 'can', 'very', 'well', 'see', 'actor', 'series', 'tonight', 'theater', 'Charring', 'Cross', 'Road', 'following', 'night', 'cinema', 'third', 'night', 'actor', 'actress', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'three', 'locales', 'So', 'what', 'next', 'season', 'know', 'now', 'doppelganger-ism', 'can', 'be', 'carried', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'invested', 'twins', 'are', 'longing', 'next', 'series', 'six', 'episodes', 'let', 'say', 'ten', 'years', 'later.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",Jekyll

It keeps you riveted the entire time and constantly wondering what he will do next. Nesbitt's dual role is superbly played right down to body language and subtle facial cues, and the supporting roles are very well played to further enhance the whole experience. The script and screen-play alternately makes you laugh when you least expect it, then totally shocked by the next move, then intrigued by the next revelation. The whole story is taken in a totally new direction that is both fantastic and believable. My only ONLY complaint is that the ending leaves something to be desired. I won't spoil it, but by this point you've already figured out the point made in the end scene. It could've been left out completely without harming the whole at all.I love a good suspense but I'd long ago given up on any good scare movies. Jekyll takes the cake on both - and keeps you thinking long after besides. Every few months I find myself watching it again.

1078135,A1ZQYRVSZDI42J,B000QXDEH2,"Julie L. Hayes ""bibliophile""","[1, 1]","Tom Jackman (James Nesbitt) has a bit of a problem. On the surface, he seems to have everything he could possibly want--a beautiful wife, Claire (Gina Bellman) who adores him and a set of twin sons that he loves to death. But Tom's problem lies beneath the surface. He's just discovered that someone else is sharing his personal space, and this someone else is more than just a facet of Tom's personality, he's an entity all of his own that happens to also inhabit Tom's body. &lt;lj-cut text=""And he's a psychopath."">Tom leaves his family, for their own protection, but doesn't offer a reason, and takes a sleazy flat where he installs a chair with a wicked containment system, and a psychiatric nurse, Katherine (Michelle Ryan) to help him keep an eye on things. She helps him keep track of the comings and goings of his alter ego, who is basically an overgrown child as well as devilishly charming. He calls himself Mr. Hyde, after the character in the Robert Louis Stevenson story. Tom sets rules for him, and non-obedience has its consequences, primarily being restrained for long periods of time, which Hyde abhors. He communicates with Hyde by means of a Dictaphone which he always carries with him.A distraught Claire hires a detective, Miranda, to follow Tom, who reports back that he isn't having an affair, as she feared. But Miranda doesn't tell Claire all that she's found out. Claire confronts Tom, demanding to know what's going on. He traces the photographs back to Miranda and her pregnant partner, Min. He tells her he knows she's been following him, he's seen the big black van. While Miranda admits to her surveillance, she tells him he has other problems--she doesn't own a big black van.In searching for the truth, Tom begins to wonder if somehow he is related to Stevenson's original Dr. Jekyll, and that maybe the story wasn't the piece of fiction everyone believes it to be. All roads lead to Rome, and what he learns threatens the lives of everyone around him, as a hundred year old plot is uncovered. The lines between good and evil become blurred, and it's hard to tell which side is which, and which side will emerge victorious.The entirety of Jekyll is six short episodes, which is a travesty. I could have kept watching for a lot longer, I was so intrigued by the characters. But the BBC, in its infinite wisdom, stopped there, for its own reasons. The series was penned by veteran Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat. Quite the pedigree, eh? Interestingly, when David Tennant announced his departure from that long-running series, apparently James Nesbitt was mentioned as a possible replacement, but he declined the role, saying he could not follow in the footsteps of Tennant and Eccleston. But I digress.This show will pull you in from the beginning, from the first image of the chair in the flat. It'll keep you guessing and speculating and trying to keep ahead of what's going on trying to second-guess the truth. But chances are you'll still be wrong.James Nesbitt is brilliant as Tom Jackman/Hyde. He plays both roles to perfection, and at times you forget that they aren't two different men. They look different, sound different, move differently and act differently. Hyde is a hedonist, an amoral child who does what he wants, when he wants, and has no interest in the consequences.  He is also quite charming, and fascinating to watch.At first, I really didn't like Tom's wife Claire, and her poor me I want my husband back brand of sniveling. But as the series progressed, I saw her in a different light, and came to appreciate her as a person. By the end, I saw her as a worthy mate to Tom, and the perfect foil for Mr. Hyde. An interesting side note on the actor who plays Tom's best friend, Peter Syme - he played a pilot in the Star Wars film, and inspired his nephew to go into acting also, and years later he too played in Star Wars films. The nephew's name, by the way, was Ewan McGregor.The acting is superb, the writing quick-witted and fascinating. There is never a dull moment, especially not when Mr. Hyde is around. It's only six hours long, but it's a fascinating six hours, and a journey I heartily recommend. In the hierarchy of films that deal with the infamous case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I place this series at the top. If you enjoy this, find the soundtrack to the musical version of Jekyll and Hyde, as sung by Robert Cuccioli. But be warned not to bother with the DVD, for that contains David Hasselhoff in the title role and is to be avoided at all costs because oh my God, he can neither sing nor act. Just saying.Side note: I find it interesting and sometimes amusing when British actors take on an American accent. I imagine the British feel the same way when Americans attempt theirs.",5,An updated version of a classic story that will leave you breathless,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,4755,"['Tom', 'Jackman', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'bit', 'problem', 'surface', 'have', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'want', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Gina', 'Bellman', 'who', 'set', 'twin', 'sons', 'death', 'Tom', 'problem', 'surface', 'just', 'discovered', 'someone', 'else', 'sharing', 'personal', 'space', 'someone', 'else', 'more', 'just', 'facet', 'Tom', 'personality', 'entity', 'own', 'also', 'inhabit', 'Tom', 'body', 'lt', 'lj-cut', 'text=', 'psychopath', '>', 'Tom', 'family', 'own', 'protection', ""n't"", 'offer', 'reason', 'sleazy', 'flat', 'where', 'chair', 'wicked', 'containment', 'system', 'psychiatric', 'nurse', 'Katherine', 'Michelle', 'Ryan', 'help', 'keep', 'eye', 'things', 'keep', 'track', 'comings', 'goings', 'alter', 'ego', 'who', 'basically', 'overgrown', 'child', 'as', 'well', 'devilishly', 'charming', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'character', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'story', 'Tom', 'rules', 'non-obedience', 'consequences', 'primarily', 'being', 'restrained', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'Hyde', 'abhors', 'Hyde', 'means', 'Dictaphone', 'always', 'him.A', 'distraught', 'Claire', 'detective', 'Miranda', 'follow', 'Tom', 'who', 'back', ""n't"", 'having', 'affair', 'feared', 'Miranda', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Claire', 'found', 'out', 'Claire', 'confronts', 'Tom', 'demanding', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'photographs', 'back', 'Miranda', 'pregnant', 'partner', 'Min', 'been', 'following', 'seen', 'big', 'black', 'van', 'Miranda', 'surveillance', 'other', 'problems', ""n't"", 'own', 'big', 'black', 'van.In', 'searching', 'truth', 'Tom', 'wonder', 'somehow', 'related', 'Stevenson', 'original', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'maybe', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'piece', 'fiction', 'everyone', 'be', 'roads', 'lead', 'Rome', 'what', 'lives', 'everyone', 'hundred', 'year', 'old', 'plot', 'uncovered', 'lines', 'good', 'evil', 'become', 'blurred', 'hard', 'tell', 'side', 'side', 'will', 'emerge', 'victorious.The', 'entirety', 'Jekyll', 'six', 'short', 'episodes', 'travesty', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'watching', 'lot', 'longer', 'was', 'so', 'intrigued', 'characters', 'BBC', 'infinite', 'wisdom', 'stopped', 'there', 'own', 'reasons', 'series', 'was', 'penned', 'veteran', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'writer', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'pedigree', 'eh', 'Interestingly', 'when', 'David', 'Tennant', 'announced', 'departure', 'long-running', 'series', 'apparently', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'was', 'mentioned', 'possible', 'replacement', 'declined', 'role', 'saying', 'could', 'not', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Tennant', 'Eccleston', 'digress.This', 'show', 'will', 'pull', 'beginning', 'first', 'image', 'chair', 'flat', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'guessing', 'speculating', 'trying', 'keep', 'ahead', 'what', 'going', 'trying', 'second-guess', 'truth', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'wrong.James', 'Nesbitt', 'brilliant', 'Tom', 'Jackman/Hyde', 'roles', 'perfection', 'times', 'forget', 'are', ""n't"", 'two', 'different', 'men', 'look', 'different', 'sound', 'different', 'move', 'differently', 'act', 'differently', 'Hyde', 'hedonist', 'amoral', 'child', 'who', 'what', 'when', 'interest', 'consequences', 'also', 'quite', 'charming', 'fascinating', 'watch.At', 'first', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'Tom', 'wife', 'Claire', 'poor', 'want', 'husband', 'back', 'brand', 'sniveling', 'series', 'progressed', 'saw', 'different', 'light', 'came', 'appreciate', 'person', 'end', 'saw', 'worthy', 'mate', 'Tom', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'actor', 'who', 'Tom', 'best', 'friend', 'Peter', 'Syme', 'played', 'pilot', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film', 'inspired', 'nephew', 'go', 'acting', 'also', 'years', 'later', 'too', 'played', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films', 'nephew', 'name', 'way', 'was', 'Ewan', 'McGregor.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'writing', 'quick-witted', 'fascinating', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'especially', 'not', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'around', 'only', 'six', 'hours', 'long', 'fascinating', 'six', 'hours', 'journey', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'hierarchy', 'films', 'deal', 'infamous', 'case', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'place', 'series', 'top', 'enjoy', 'find', 'soundtrack', 'musical', 'version', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'sung', 'Robert', 'Cuccioli', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'bother', 'DVD', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'title', 'role', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs', 'oh', 'God', 'can', 'neither', 'sing', 'act', 'Just', 'saying.Side', 'note', 'find', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'amusing', 'when', 'British', 'actors', 'take', 'American', 'accent', 'imagine', 'British', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'Americans', 'attempt', 'theirs']",Jekyll

Lot's of horror, lot's of humor, plenty of over the top performances by James Nesbitt, who totally sells the potentially tired premise. A great supporting cast with equally strong performances. The writing is superb as Hugo Award-winning Steven Moffat who penned some the scariest, best written stories of the new Doctor Who series (The Empty Child, Blink) reworks Stevenson's century-old concept.Some mild spoilers follow...Much of the exposition is given in later episodes through flashbacks and some hyper-race memory, but the series opens with  Dr. Tom Jackman, having left his life and family behind in  a desperate attempt to protect them from his ""dark side"" eventually dubbed Mr. Hyde.Dr. Jackman has left is family and job. ""Blackouts"" lead him to hire a psychiatric nurse, played by Michelle Ryan (the new The Bionic Woman) to oversee his transformations and serving as a mediator between Hyde and Jackman. His wife, Claire played by Gina Bellman (from Coupling), has hired a private detective to find out what's going on with Tom, while he fears Hyde even learning about his family. The private detective Meera Syal (of The Kumars at No 42 a.k.a granny) accidentally reveals Tom's family to Hyde after an unscheduled change takes place. Hyde befriends Claire and the kids as ""Uncle Billy."" Upon his ""return"" Jackman  learns that his family is at risk...other external forces are trying to draw Hyde out for their own covert agendas. While at the zoo with his sons along with shady family friend (played by James Lawson Star Wars' Wedge), Tom converses on his cellphone with his very awake alter-ego and literally enters the lion's den to save his son. A mystery woman, claiming to be his mother, reveals that Tom is a direct descendant of Dr Henry Jekyll, who had no heirs. Dr. Jackman flees, fighting his dark side as he may Hyde is still coming, as are the organization planning to catch him.Claire eventually learns of Hyde, confronting him demanding her husband back. But there's lots more flashbacks, reveals and twists before she'll get anything of the kind. She may have to learn dark secrets and not only about Tom.The language and mood of the series is dark and adult, but I'd recommend it, plenty of heart-pumping thriller pacing along with its grislier moments. Nesbitt's transformation into Hyde is subtle from an effects stand-point, but from an acting aspect it is rocking! Gina Bellman's performance is also stand-out good.The series has many shockingly disturbing moments, even when Hyde isn't on screen (well Nesbitt is) like... A terrifying message in Jackman's own blood on a wall, ""When you sleep, I will eat your children,"" the children locked asphyxiating in steel caskets or just about whenever Jackman's Family is alone with Hyde.Ultimately, the truth about Jackman is revealed and it is not as unexpected as some of Hyde's actions throughout the climax of the show. Enough questions remain support a second series, hopefully with as much of the ""surviving"" original cast as possible.Speaking of cast, I was shocked to see that Amazon failed to list the leading actor James Nesbitt on the DVD info, I mean I love Ewan McGreggor's Uncle Wedge, but props to the man playing two roles for Pete's sake!",5,RUN IF YOU WANT TO LIVE...RUN IF YOU WANT TO LIVE...RUN IF YOU WANT TO LIVE...RUN IF YOU WANT TO LIVE..,1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,3322,"['Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'classic', 'story', 'make-over', ""n't"", 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Lot', 'horror', 'lot', 'humor', 'plenty', 'top', 'performances', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'who', 'totally', 'potentially', 'tired', 'premise', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'strong', 'performances', 'writing', 'superb', 'Hugo', 'Award-winning', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'who', 'penned', 'scariest', 'best', 'written', 'stories', 'new', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'Empty', 'Child', 'Blink', 'Stevenson', 'century-old', 'concept.Some', 'mild', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'Much', 'exposition', 'given', 'later', 'episodes', 'flashbacks', 'hyper-race', 'memory', 'series', 'Dr.', 'Tom', 'Jackman', 'having', 'left', 'life', 'family', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'protect', 'dark', 'side', 'eventually', 'dubbed', 'Mr.', 'Hyde.Dr', 'Jackman', 'left', 'family', 'job', 'Blackouts', 'lead', 'hire', 'psychiatric', 'nurse', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Ryan', 'new', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'oversee', 'transformations', 'serving', 'mediator', 'Hyde', 'Jackman', 'wife', 'Claire', 'played', 'Gina', 'Bellman', 'Coupling', 'hired', 'private', 'detective', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'Tom', 'Hyde', 'even', 'learning', 'family', 'private', 'detective', 'Meera', 'Syal', 'Kumars', 'No', '42', 'a.k.a', 'granny', 'accidentally', 'Tom', 'family', 'Hyde', 'unscheduled', 'change', 'place', 'Hyde', 'Claire', 'kids', 'Uncle', 'Billy', 'return', 'Jackman', 'family', 'risk', 'other', 'external', 'forces', 'are', 'trying', 'draw', 'Hyde', 'own', 'covert', 'agendas', 'zoo', 'sons', 'shady', 'family', 'friend', 'played', 'James', 'Lawson', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Wedge', 'Tom', 'cellphone', 'very', 'awake', 'alter-ego', 'literally', 'lion', 'den', 'save', 'son', 'mystery', 'woman', 'claiming', 'be', 'mother', 'reveals', 'Tom', 'direct', 'descendant', 'Dr', 'Henry', 'Jekyll', 'who', 'had', 'heirs', 'Dr.', 'Jackman', 'fighting', 'dark', 'side', 'may', 'Hyde', 'still', 'coming', 'are', 'organization', 'planning', 'catch', 'him.Claire', 'eventually', 'Hyde', 'confronting', 'demanding', 'husband', 'back', 'lots', 'more', 'flashbacks', 'reveals', 'twists', ""'ll"", 'get', 'anything', 'kind', 'may', 'have', 'learn', 'dark', 'secrets', 'not', 'only', 'Tom.The', 'language', 'mood', 'series', 'dark', 'adult', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'plenty', 'heart-pumping', 'thriller', 'pacing', 'along', 'grislier', 'moments', 'Nesbitt', 'transformation', 'Hyde', 'subtle', 'effects', 'stand-point', 'acting', 'aspect', 'rocking', 'Gina', 'Bellman', 'performance', 'also', 'stand-out', 'good.The', 'series', 'many', 'shockingly', 'disturbing', 'moments', 'even', 'when', 'Hyde', ""n't"", 'screen', 'well', 'Nesbitt', 'terrifying', 'message', 'Jackman', 'own', 'blood', 'wall', 'When', 'sleep', 'will', 'eat', 'children', 'children', 'locked', 'asphyxiating', 'steel', 'caskets', 'just', 'whenever', 'Jackman', 'Family', 'alone', 'Hyde.Ultimately', 'truth', 'Jackman', 'revealed', 'not', 'as', 'unexpected', 'Hyde', 'actions', 'climax', 'show', 'Enough', 'questions', 'remain', 'support', 'second', 'series', 'hopefully', 'as', 'much', 'surviving', 'original', 'cast', 'possible.Speaking', 'cast', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'Amazon', 'failed', 'list', 'leading', 'actor', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'DVD', 'info', 'mean', 'love', 'Ewan', 'McGreggor', 'Uncle', 'Wedge', 'man', 'playing', 'two', 'roles', 'Pete', 'sake']",Jekyll

I was not disappointed.This series contains 6 episodes with the first 5 entitled ""Jekyll"" and and last one ""Hyde.""  Each episode runs a little under one hour and the time will fly by as you watch the story unfold.  I will not provide any detailed summaries as that will ruin the beauty of this very innovative show.  This series turned the usual ""Jekyll and Hyde"" story on its head, it's much more then a modern take on the old story.  Modern science combined with big business is a very scary combination.  Is Dr. Jackman a clone of the original Dr. Jackyll?  Who is his real mother?  What triggered Dr. Jackman's transformation into Hyde?  All of these questions are answered and there are some genuine twists that I did not see coming (although you can see the clues looking back).The lead actor is amazing, we see subtle differences between Jackman and Hyde.  As violent or primative as Hyde acted, I could not help but like him.  Maybe that was just me and I should seek help?  The American heading up the ""Hyde"" task force for the super secret project was a great character.  The fact that it was an englishman playing a  stereotypical american was vastly entertainly.  All of the characters were well acted and I liked that in every subsequent episode, we see a little different side of each character.The only problem I have with this show is near the end when Dr. Jackman/Hyde 's family is threatened.  No supersonic speed or strength was used when it could have been.  What's up with that?  I understand they used that scene to get the ending they wanted but they could have written this part a wee bit better to match the rest of the series.  I deducted one star for this disappointing section that fell short and dragged on.Overall, I highly recommend this series for something different and great - how come we don't get to see these kinds of shows here in the States?

The series, which runs eight episodes, was created and written by Stephen Moffat, who I recognized as the mastermind behind the hilariously raunchy Coupling (the original BBC series, not the wretched American adaptation), but who apparently is a much revered writer on the newer Dr. Who series.In addition to having awesome talent behind the camera, the series benefits from an outstanding cast, led by James Nesbitt as Dr. Tom Jackman, who may or may not be the descendant of Dr. Henry Jekyll, who has no descendants...it's complicated. Jackman is our man of dual aspect, and communicates with his Hyde via a pocket dictaphone, leading to messages varying from ""Why can't you ever leave me a message about where you parked the car?"" to ""This guy has a knife, but use non-lethal force."" Nesbitt is excellent as both sides of Jackman, and as Hyde he's electric.Not knowing about Tom's hidden Hyde, his wife suffers through the resulting estrangement, until she too is drawn into his dual life. Gina Bellman, who played the hot airhead Jane on Coupling, is in fine form as a strong, smart, passionate wife and mother, forced to deal with the realization that she's not just Mrs. Jackman, but Mrs. Hyde...and wait till her husband gets home. And what's the deal with their twin sons...?But this is no horrific domestic drama, it's sheer pulp wonderfulness, as Tom realizes his daily routines -- and secrets -- are under close observation by some shadowy organization with lots of money and lots of power. And they, naturally, are very, very interested in getting their hands on Hyde for their own nefarious purposes.The resulting story is full of wit, action, humanity, inhumanity, sexiness, brutality, surprise, and most of all HYDE.As I said earlier, the story lasts just eight episodes, but I was left hungry for more.
