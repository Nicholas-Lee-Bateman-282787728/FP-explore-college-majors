She then meets a man (Liam Neeson) who causes her own sexuality to blossom. But an ""incident"" occurs between Neeson and the daughter that filters back to the ex-husband who then fights Keaton for custody of the girl. Neeson is made out to be a sleazebucket at the trial, and Keaton sacrifices him in the attempt to win her daughter back. Of course Keaton's all-out battle to win her daughter back is admirable, and I suppose it is meant for us to think of her as a victim of a male-run society that is penalyzing her for her sudden sexual blossoming and openness in child rearing. I couldn't help, though, shedding a tear or two for Neeson, who is the sacrificial lamb here. Keaton's performance is typical, which for me is not saying very much: I don't care for her as an actress and find her overacting most of the time.",3,Between a rock and a hard place,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,969,"['Based', 'Sue', 'Miller', 'novel', 'somewhat', 'frigid', 'woman', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'raising', '8-year-old', 'daughter', 'using', 'modern', 'open', 'ideas', 'then', 'man', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'own', 'sexuality', 'blossom', 'incident', 'Neeson', 'daughter', 'back', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'then', 'Keaton', 'custody', 'girl', 'Neeson', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'sleazebucket', 'trial', 'Keaton', 'attempt', 'win', 'daughter', 'back', 'course', 'Keaton', 'all-out', 'battle', 'win', 'daughter', 'back', 'admirable', 'suppose', 'meant', 'think', 'victim', 'male-run', 'society', 'penalyzing', 'sudden', 'sexual', 'blossoming', 'openness', 'child', 'rearing', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'shedding', 'tear', 'two', 'Neeson', 'who', 'sacrificial', 'lamb', 'here', 'Keaton', 'performance', 'typical', 'not', 'saying', 'very', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'actress', 'find', 'overacting', 'most', 'time']",N/A

247638,A15RB66290XLRH,6301225368,Jessica,"[16, 25]","Being a tremendous fan of Diane Keaton's work, I rented this movie (I'm still... that this movie isn't sold anywhere), and it immediately rated as one of my top-ten favorite Keaton videos. It honestly is an enigma that this movie didn't get enough praise it deserves.  Most of the scenes are incredibly sweet, warm, and intimate. That's what makes this movie so great. When Keaton's character, Anna, meets Liam Neeson's character, Leo, there's a unmistakable bond forming. I especially love the scene when Anna goes to Leo's apartment and Leo and Anna becomes one, dancing in front of Leo's sculpture, making shadows on the wall from the light shining on them from behind. This is an esoteric concept of first love. I really thought it was so sweet when Anna confessed to Leo that she thought she wasn't very good at sex, and he gently assures her that they can fix that. There's no judgment in that scene;it's obvious that Leo really loves Anna, and their love is vivid.  Another favorite scene is when Anna and her daughter, Molly, are in the bathtub with Leo reading to them. This is truly intimate, and I just love the fact that they were so open-minded about being naked in front of Molly. There's just so much tenderness and love. It was, to me, beautiful.  And yet another favorite scene is when Molly has a bad dream and goes into Anna's room while she and Leo are making love, and they comfort her until she falls asleep.There's another display of intimacy, about caring and love. The three of them together was absolutely wonderful.  That is why I found it incredibly appalling that Anna's ex-husband, Brian, goes to court for something that happened between Molly and Leo that had absoluely no intention of happening. (I won't ruin the ending for you). But I found the ending truly sad and final. A soon-to-be family are wrenched apart by an innocent mistake. I felt bad, because I knew they could have had a wonderful life together. I also felt bad for Anna and Leo. I could really see their love shown for each other. They were so comfortable together; their feelings for each other were vivid and beautiful. This is a movie of non-judgment and unconditional love, and that's what makes it so special.  I honestly don't understand why this movie was considered a failure. Keaton is at her best in this movie, and Neeson is simply wonderful. I consider myself as an efficient movie critic, and I know which movies are bad or good. This movie is a MUST-SEE!!! I acclaim Keaton especially for her wonderful work in this movie. 'The Good Mother' is proof that Keaton is one of the world's most rare and special actresses.  If you're not suffering from brain deterioration, immediately rent this movie! You won't regret it.",5,Simply a must-see,983577600,"03 3, 2001",2001,2731,"['Being', 'tremendous', 'fan', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'work', 'rented', 'movie', ""'m"", 'still', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sold', 'anywhere', 'immediately', 'rated', 'one', 'top-ten', 'favorite', 'Keaton', 'videos', 'honestly', 'enigma', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'praise', 'Most', 'scenes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'warm', 'intimate', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'When', 'Keaton', 'character', 'Anna', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'character', 'Leo', 'unmistakable', 'bond', 'forming', 'especially', 'love', 'scene', 'when', 'Anna', 'Leo', 'apartment', 'Leo', 'Anna', 'one', 'dancing', 'front', 'Leo', 'sculpture', 'making', 'shadows', 'wall', 'light', 'shining', 'behind', 'esoteric', 'concept', 'first', 'love', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'sweet', 'when', 'Anna', 'confessed', 'Leo', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'sex', 'gently', 'can', 'fix', 'judgment', 'scene', 'obvious', 'Leo', 'really', 'Anna', 'love', 'vivid', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'Anna', 'daughter', 'Molly', 'are', 'bathtub', 'Leo', 'reading', 'truly', 'intimate', 'just', 'love', 'fact', 'were', 'so', 'open-minded', 'being', 'naked', 'front', 'Molly', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'tenderness', 'love', 'was', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'Molly', 'bad', 'dream', 'Anna', 'room', 'Leo', 'are', 'making', 'love', 'comfort', 'asleep.There', 'display', 'intimacy', 'caring', 'love', 'three', 'together', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'why', 'found', 'incredibly', 'appalling', 'Anna', 'ex-husband', 'Brian', 'court', 'something', 'happened', 'Molly', 'Leo', 'had', 'absoluely', 'intention', 'happening', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'ending', 'found', 'ending', 'truly', 'sad', 'final', 'soon-to-be', 'family', 'are', 'wrenched', 'apart', 'innocent', 'mistake', 'felt', 'bad', 'knew', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'wonderful', 'life', 'together', 'also', 'felt', 'bad', 'Anna', 'Leo', 'could', 'really', 'see', 'love', 'shown', 'other', 'were', 'so', 'comfortable', 'together', 'feelings', 'other', 'were', 'vivid', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'non-judgment', 'unconditional', 'love', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'considered', 'failure', 'Keaton', 'best', 'movie', 'Neeson', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'consider', 'efficient', 'movie', 'critic', 'know', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'good', 'movie', 'MUST-SEE', 'acclaim', 'Keaton', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'work', 'movie', 'Good', 'Mother', 'proof', 'Keaton', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'rare', 'special', 'actresses', ""'re"", 'not', 'suffering', 'brain', 'deterioration', 'immediately', 'rent', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A
247639,A2LJKDPRVR907S,6301225368,Lisa Siegel,"[30, 36]","I was warned before watching this movie that it would not be one of those 'sit in front of the television with a bowl of popcorn' movies.  For half of the movie, I just sat there, my eyes glued to the screen, watching Diane Keaton in a simply wonderful and dramatic role.Anna Dunlap (Keaton) is a newly divorced woman with an adorable six year old daughter.  They have a wonderful relationship, and it is very evident when you sit down and watch them together.  Enter Liam Neeson.  He starts out as a person with whom you would not want to get to know, but after a few minutes, he reveals that he's just in a bad mood and he is actually quite nice.  When he first meets Molly (the very adorable Asia Vieira), she is very shy towards him, but she learns to like him and you can see that there is a bond between them.  When something happens (I don't want to say what), and Molly's father wants full-time custody of her, the movie becomes a full-blown drama.  It is, I admit, hard to watch some of the courtroom scenes, but they are so powerful and they draw you into the story.  In a way, I saw the end result coming, but not exactly like it did.  It definitely showed finality in the family.Keaton's performace, like I said above, was incredibly powerful and she does a wonderful job portraying Molly's mother.  The main reason I bought this movie was because of Diane Keaton, since she is my favorite actress and this movie shows her in her best dramatic role, in my opinion.  If only it had received higher reviews when it came out.  But I go by what looks good to me, and to me, this looked good, mainly because of the cast and the story.",5,"So Powerful, So Wonderful",1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,1641,"['was', 'warned', 'watching', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'one', ""'sit"", 'front', 'television', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'movies', 'half', 'movie', 'just', 'sat', 'there', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'watching', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'dramatic', 'role.Anna', 'Dunlap', 'Keaton', 'newly', 'divorced', 'woman', 'adorable', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'have', 'wonderful', 'relationship', 'very', 'evident', 'when', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'together', 'Enter', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'out', 'person', 'whom', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'few', 'minutes', 'just', 'bad', 'mood', 'actually', 'quite', 'nice', 'When', 'first', 'Molly', 'very', 'adorable', 'Asia', 'Vieira', 'very', 'shy', 'towards', 'like', 'can', 'see', 'bond', 'When', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'what', 'Molly', 'father', 'full-time', 'custody', 'movie', 'full-blown', 'drama', 'admit', 'hard', 'watch', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'draw', 'story', 'way', 'saw', 'end', 'result', 'coming', 'not', 'exactly', 'did', 'definitely', 'showed', 'finality', 'family.Keaton', 'performace', 'said', 'was', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'Molly', 'mother', 'main', 'reason', 'bought', 'movie', 'was', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'favorite', 'actress', 'movie', 'best', 'dramatic', 'role', 'opinion', 'only', 'had', 'received', 'higher', 'reviews', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'go', 'what', 'good', 'looked', 'good', 'mainly', 'cast', 'story']",N/A

Diane Keatons charactor starts off a little too sweet, almost like an air head.  But I continued watching because I have known women to have that type of personality.  It was the middle half of the movie that shook me to the core. Her character changes completley as would anyone who goes through the conflict she must deal with.  The life changing experience (a daughter she clearly cherishs is taken away for (innocent?) sexual misconduct)  forces Keeton's character to ""grow up"" makes the movie fabulous.
