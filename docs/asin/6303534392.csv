Yes the students seem to be extremely flexible dancers and there is artistic lighting and filming, but I appreciated the effort. This video offers a dynamic flowing yoga session and conveys the feeling of being in a real class. The instructor is down to earth and sincere. As an intermediate student, I found it to be challenging yet doable. I would not recommend it for beginners, but I think intermediate students who like Ashtanga and Power Yoga will really like this tape.",5,Good yoga--good workout!,1001030400,"09 21, 2001",2001,599,"['was', 'reluctant', 'buy', 'few', 'negative', 'comments', 'people', 'being', 'too', 'pretty/showy', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Yes', 'students', 'seem', 'be', 'extremely', 'flexible', 'dancers', 'artistic', 'lighting', 'filming', 'appreciated', 'effort', 'video', 'dynamic', 'flowing', 'yoga', 'session', 'conveys', 'feeling', 'being', 'real', 'class', 'instructor', 'down', 'earth', 'sincere', 'intermediate', 'student', 'found', 'be', 'challenging', 'yet', 'doable', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'think', 'intermediate', 'students', 'who', 'like', 'Ashtanga', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'will', 'really', 'like', 'tape']","Bryan Kest - Power Yoga, Vol. 3 - Sweat VHS"

Sullivan,"[11, 11]","I started w/ Ali MacGraw's ""Yoga Mind & Body,"" and then moved up to Kathy Smith's ""New Yoga Challenge"" and now Bryan Kest's video, ""Sweat,"" has once again advanced me further in my yoga practice.Now, I do other yoga routines daily (along w/ strength training & cardio), but one day I week I like to work all the kinks out with a good power yoga video. It's not easy finding one that's challenging but do-able for me, and I'm quite pleased & thankful that ""Sweat"" fits the bill nicely.You start w/ sun salutations, add warrior poses & side stretches (holding for several breaths), some twists & arm balances, and then to the floor for a little abs work, some forward fold variations, a nice long-ish backbend, and then you finish by stretching out your back with the plow pose. Well, that's the gist, anyway.Bryan's instruction is fine, but not for beginners. It's more for people who already are familiar with the poses, who might appreciate some fine-tuning: he tells you where to look and what muscle(s) should be turning out while others turn in, etc. ... He seems quite gentle & motivating to me.Yes, he does kinda pose a bit, which is a little silly but, hey, he's got a fine body, there, so power to him. And he handles his students in class, which, combined with his posing & the artsy production quality, comes off as kinda sexy -- something I've never seen nor did I expect to see in a yoga video. At first, it was a little odd to me, but now I think it's cool. He rolls people's shoulders under & pulls on their legs during relaxation pose and, man, that looks like it'd feel good!Anyway, I think Bryan Kest's ""hands on"" yoga instructing is great, and I often try to extend my own body the way he's demonstrating on his students, and I find it helps me settle deeper into each pose. I've been doing this tape once a week for awhile now, and the time always FLIES by, and I'm always loose & refreshed when it's over. I have been challenged, but I haven't been frustrated. Cause, after all, its not about depth in a pose, but about breathing and feeling something, as Bryan reminds us throughout the tape. And, oh, you'll feel something, alright!",5,Love the Workout!,1022025600,"05 22, 2002",2002,2154,"['started', 'w/', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'Yoga', 'Mind', 'Body', 'then', 'moved', 'up', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'New', 'Yoga', 'Challenge', 'now', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'video', 'Sweat', 'once', 'again', 'advanced', 'further', 'yoga', 'practice.Now', 'do', 'other', 'yoga', 'routines', 'daily', 'w/', 'strength', 'training', 'cardio', 'one', 'day', 'week', 'like', 'work', 'kinks', 'out', 'good', 'power', 'yoga', 'video', 'not', 'easy', 'finding', 'one', 'challenging', 'do-able', ""'m"", 'quite', 'pleased', 'thankful', 'Sweat', 'bill', 'nicely.You', 'start', 'w/', 'sun', 'salutations', 'add', 'warrior', 'poses', 'side', 'stretches', 'holding', 'several', 'breaths', 'twists', 'arm', 'balances', 'then', 'floor', 'little', 'abs', 'work', 'forward', 'fold', 'variations', 'nice', 'long-ish', 'backbend', 'then', 'finish', 'stretching', 'out', 'back', 'plow', 'pose', 'Well', 'gist', 'anyway.Bryan', 'instruction', 'fine', 'not', 'beginners', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'are', 'familiar', 'poses', 'who', 'might', 'appreciate', 'fine-tuning', 'where', 'look', 'what', 'muscle', 'should', 'be', 'turning', 'out', 'others', 'turn', 'etc', 'quite', 'gentle', 'motivating', 'me.Yes', 'kinda', 'pose', 'bit', 'little', 'silly', 'hey', 'got', 'fine', 'body', 'so', 'power', 'students', 'class', 'combined', 'posing', 'artsy', 'production', 'quality', 'off', 'kinda', 'sexy', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'did', 'expect', 'see', 'yoga', 'video', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'odd', 'now', 'think', 'cool', 'people', 'shoulders', 'pulls', 'legs', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'man', ""'d"", 'feel', 'good', 'Anyway', 'think', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'hands', 'yoga', 'instructing', 'great', 'often', 'try', 'extend', 'own', 'body', 'way', 'demonstrating', 'students', 'find', 'settle', 'deeper', 'pose', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'tape', 'once', 'week', 'awhile', 'now', 'time', 'always', 'FLIES', ""'m"", 'always', 'loose', 'refreshed', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'challenged', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'frustrated', 'Cause', 'not', 'depth', 'pose', 'breathing', 'feeling', 'something', 'Bryan', 'tape', 'oh', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'something', 'alright']","Bryan Kest - Power Yoga, Vol. 3 - Sweat VHS"

No other yoga teacher's tapes leave me feeling as simultaneously loose, strong and tingling as Bryan's do.  I feel that these workouts have also helped my athletic endeavors by making me much stronger, smoother and better able to move my whole body dynamically.  I really wonder about the people who say that these workouts didn't make them sweat -- from what I can tell, every pose has deeper and deeper levels you go to to increase the muscular, breathing and balance challenge in the pose.
