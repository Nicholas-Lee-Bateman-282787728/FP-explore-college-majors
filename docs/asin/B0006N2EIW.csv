871203,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0006N2EIW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","My original intention was to rip into this movie with as much savagery as I could muster, but I just can't do it for some reason.  Sure, They Call Him Sasquatch is a terrible movie - make no mistake about that - but I suppose it has a few good points.  The two rednecks did make me laugh, as did the lady with the psychic connection to Bigfoot - and it's a little difficult to judge the two grumpy old men too harshly when I fully intend to become a grumpy old man myself some day.  Still, you could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out this movie had an estimated budget of a million dollars.  Someone at the heart of this production had to be embezzling because they surely didn't spend that much money on the movie - more like a couple hundred bucks, if you ask me.  Maybe Garry Marshall demanded the rest of the dough for appearing in such a legacy-killing film.Basically, this is yet another ""put a bunch of dummies in the woods and see what happens"" movies, with the only twist being that these yahoos are ""serious"" Bigfoot hunters.  You have the two rednecks who want to mount a ""Sas-kee-atch"" head in their trailer, two long-time Bigfoot hunters competing against each other, a science geek (and his horny wife) who plans to lure the beast with pheromones and Bigfoot voice recordings, a talkative dentist and his family (his wife tries to communicate with the Sasquatch through her psychic link to the legendary creature), two members of the rock group Bigfeet, and a TV reporter and his cameraman.  The group is visited from time to time by some hairy lunatic who warns them to leave.  Virtually all of these people are quite stupid and go about proving it on a regular basis.  The only hope you as the viewer have is that there will indeed be a few funny moments here and there - the film has absolutely nothing else to offer.  Fortunately, there actually are a few funny moments, thanks largely to the two rednecks - but it's not enough to make They Call Him Sasquatch a pain free experience.  There were moments when I began questioning my love for bad movies, wondering why I torment myself with films like this.  Still, since it did make me laugh a few times, I'm going to be really generous and give this film two stars.  You're going to need a real passion for bad movies in order to make it through this one, though.",2,Stinks like a skunk ape -- but it does manage to deliver a few laughs,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,2350,"['original', 'intention', 'was', 'rip', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'savagery', 'could', 'muster', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'reason', 'Sure', 'Call', 'Him', 'Sasquatch', 'terrible', 'movie', 'make', 'mistake', 'suppose', 'few', 'good', 'points', 'two', 'rednecks', 'did', 'make', 'laugh', 'did', 'lady', 'psychic', 'connection', 'Bigfoot', 'little', 'difficult', 'judge', 'two', 'grumpy', 'old', 'men', 'too', 'harshly', 'when', 'fully', 'intend', 'become', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'day', 'Still', 'could', 'have', 'knocked', 'feather', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'had', 'estimated', 'budget', 'million', 'dollars', 'Someone', 'heart', 'production', 'had', 'be', 'embezzling', 'surely', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'that', 'much', 'money', 'movie', 'more', 'couple', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'ask', 'Maybe', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'demanded', 'rest', 'dough', 'appearing', 'such', 'legacy-killing', 'film.Basically', 'yet', 'put', 'bunch', 'dummies', 'woods', 'see', 'what', 'movies', 'only', 'twist', 'being', 'yahoos', 'are', 'serious', 'Bigfoot', 'hunters', 'have', 'two', 'rednecks', 'who', 'want', 'mount', 'Sas-kee-atch', 'head', 'trailer', 'two', 'long-time', 'Bigfoot', 'hunters', 'competing', 'other', 'science', 'geek', 'horny', 'wife', 'who', 'lure', 'beast', 'pheromones', 'Bigfoot', 'voice', 'recordings', 'talkative', 'dentist', 'family', 'wife', 'tries', 'communicate', 'Sasquatch', 'psychic', 'link', 'legendary', 'creature', 'two', 'members', 'rock', 'group', 'Bigfeet', 'TV', 'reporter', 'cameraman', 'group', 'visited', 'time', 'time', 'hairy', 'lunatic', 'who', 'leave', 'Virtually', 'people', 'are', 'quite', 'stupid', 'go', 'proving', 'regular', 'basis', 'only', 'hope', 'viewer', 'have', 'will', 'indeed', 'be', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'else', 'offer', 'Fortunately', 'actually', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'thanks', 'largely', 'two', 'rednecks', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'Call', 'Him', 'Sasquatch', 'pain', 'free', 'experience', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'began', 'questioning', 'love', 'bad', 'movies', 'wondering', 'why', 'torment', 'films', 'Still', 'did', 'make', 'few', 'times', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'really', 'generous', 'give', 'film', 'two', 'stars', ""'re"", 'going', 'need', 'real', 'passion', 'bad', 'movies', 'order', 'make', 'one', 'though']",N/A

Neal McDonough (Boomtown, Medical Investigation, Desperate Housewives, Walking Tall (2004) stars as reporter Ned Dwyer, who is sent to the wilderness to investigate reports of Sasquatch sightings after two hunters obtain footage of one, but accidentally erase it. Ned's boss, Stu (played by Garry Marshall, creator of Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley and Mork and Mindy) is the one who sends Ned out on this seemingly wild goose chase. Ned meets with several individuals in the woods, including two dueling old-time Bigfoot experts (comic actor Chuck McCann and Warren Belinger), a family with a matriarch who can supposedly call in a Sasquatch with her voice and have psychic connections with it; the two hunters, a camera man and a scientist and his wife, along with a rock band called the Bigfeet. A local forest dweller, Buzz Schott, attempts to warn the group to leave, a real mountain man. The search goes on, and hilarity ensues. Does the group find the legendary beast? I recommend renting this one to find out. I would give it about 4 stars out of 5.

It is low budget and pretty hokey, but it does have some laughs. I gave this one 3 stars because it was exactly what I expected it to be when I bought it.  Actually, I bought it as a result of a family movie selection project.  Okay, I picked the worst movie of all of us, but we all enjoyed it.  We and/or I will probably never watch it again, but it was mildly amusing for a family movie night. No nudity or cursing.  The film is about some idiots trying to find evidence of Sasquatch. There's a reporter following the antics and he gets involved in the mishaps.  Most of the humor is predictable and silly.  The movie did seem to drag a bit towards the end, but all in all, it could have been worse. I probably wouldn't recommend a buy here.

Howell ""boriskhan""","[0, 0]","What we have here is a humorous look at what may be the variety of 'message board sasquatch hunters' that are all over the internet. A cast of improv comedy actors are gathered together to represent such a possible cross-collection of these less-than-scientific investigators and you get a crazy film that seeks out the big fella. Neal McDonaugh 'stars' in this film to give it a bigger name to promote. This film obviously lacks the big money for making a feature film but to make up for it we are presented with a variety of insanely crazy characters from all varieties of life and it is well done using up-and-coming actors.
