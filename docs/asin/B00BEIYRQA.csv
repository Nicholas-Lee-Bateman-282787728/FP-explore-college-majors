1632059,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00BEIYRQA,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I don&#8217;t know about you, but I really hate when a film I&#8217;m highly anticipating shows itself to be a huge waste of time.  When the year began (2013) there was one film that was at the VERY top of my most anticipated list; &#8216;The Counselor&#8217;.  This just had everything I wanted in a movie.  First, it had an original screenplay (the first) written by Cormac McCarthy, who writes such marvelously constructed books that served for some really great films in the aughts (namely &#8216;No Country for Old Men&#8217; and &#8216;The Road&#8217;).  Next, it had a pretty stellar cast.  I mean, Fassbender is so hot right now (in more than one way) and the idea of Cruz, Bardem, Pitt, Perez and Ganz in the same film made me really excited.  Third, early word was that the script was crazy and that the plum role of the devilish Malkina was going to Cameron Diaz, an actress who is really underrated and deserved a break, critically.  But really, the sole reason I was rooting for this to work was that Ridley Scott is in dire need of a true comeback, and I was praying that this was going to finally be his Oscar ticket.This was absolutely, undeniably, 100% abysmal.I don&#8217;t even know what to say about this.  Like, I&#8217;m at a complete and total loss for words, and that rarely happens.  I don&#8217;t even know how to go about reviewing this, because in my mind I didn&#8217;t really watch anything at all.  The film felt like one, long, boring conversation that made no sense whatsoever and failed to grab my interest one bit.  The character development was a joke, the performances were embarrassing and the plot was so thick with holes (or maybe they weren&#8217;t holes at all and we just weren&#8217;t really given a plot) that I found myself wishing I had decided to pass on this entirely.And let&#8217;s talk about Cameron Diaz for a minute.  I was one of her chief champions prior to seeing this.  I declared her underrated and declared, in advance, that this was going to be the performance of the year!  I wanted this to be so wonderful for her, but this character is a joke.  What is so alarming about this is that it isn&#8217;t even all her performance (which is pretty bad, to be honest), but the character itself is just so uninteresting.  Yes, she likes cheetahs and there is that car scene, but that scene itself is so ridiculously shot that it feels like a parody of a much better executed sequence.  I think it was a true disservice to her performance to redub it without the accent (which remained in some scenes and thus made her performance uneven) because it took any soul the character had, any spice, and threw it out the window.Like the rest of the film, Malkina was just bland.Drugs, snuff films, murder, dangerous cats, fast cars, wet windshields and Penelope Cruz have never been so dull.  I can&#8217;t believe that the one film I anticipated most this year just turned out to be the worst film I saw in 2013.Yes, I mean that.  This was worse than that dreadful &#8216;Walking with Dinosaurs&#8217;.

He says *to hell* to grammar and punctuation. Because who needs commas when 17 uses of ""and"" will do? Why make 12 little sentences when one large one will do? Why make your characters speak normally when they can converse in existential soliloquies? Heck, why name your characters at all?In spite of this, he is probably the most influential author alive, and one of the most divisive. His sentences can make a grown man weep, laugh, and disturbed...frequently all at once. His characters are broadly drawn, vividly realized, and unforgettable. They inhabit a dark, morally ambiguous world where Argentine vixen go cheetah hunting in the Mexican desert, where people are decapitated by razor wire stretched across roads.

1632073,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B00BEIYRQA,Brian C.,"[5, 6]","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. You have been warned. This movie has a lot of negative reviews and I have to admit, I was somewhat disappointed with the movie myself. I had very high expectations going in, as I think a lot of people did. Cormac McCarthy's first original screenplay certainly generated a lot of interest. I will be the first to admit: this movie failed to live up to the hype, fell far short of Cormac McCarthy's best novels, and it is simply impossible in this case to lay the blame on Hollywood or bad acting. Hollywood is notorious for diluting and ruining genuinely original writing but that is not what happened here. Nearly all of the problems with this movie are problems that can be traced to the script.All that having been said, I think this movie is a lot better than many critics are making it out to be. I think a lot of the complaints that people had with the movie arose from a confusion of genres. People are treating this movie as if it was meant to be a thriller. I saw it described in one review as a ""drug-war"" thriller and in another as ""a meditation on capitalism in the form of a thriller about cocaine trading."" Obviously, the plot of this movie revolves around a lawyer who gets caught up in the drug trafficking trade with disastrous results. But, is that what this movie is about?We learn very little about the specifics of the deal that the counselor (played by Michael Fassbender) has made. We know that he is involved with moving cocaine from Mexico to Chicago and that is about it. We also learn very little about the cartels themselves. We see some low level cartel members involved in the operation of transporting the cocaine in a sewage truck but there is only one scene where we get to see a high-ranking cartel member and he spends his time quoting the Spanish poet Antonio Machado, as opposed to talking about the drug-trade or money (he is most certainly NOT an image of unbridled capitalism; if anything he is an image of death and mortality).What the movie focuses on, and it seems to me nearly all the critics neglect this fact, are the relationships between the counselor and Laura (played by Penelope Cruz) and Reiner (played by Javier Bardem) and Malkina (played by Cameron Diaz). They are the central characters in the film. The plot involving the drug deal is ancillary in this sense: it is an external force that disrupts the relationships in the film. I also do not think the movie is about greed. Reiner makes it very clear that the counselor is not motivated by greed. He tried to appeal to his greed in the past and it did not work. There is only one character who I think is motivated purely by greed and that is Malkina.Ultimately, I think this movie is a movie about grief and the suddenness and inevitability of death. The most powerful scenes in the movie are: the scene where the counselor is talking to the high ranking drug cartel member and trying to make a deal to trade his life for Laura's, and the scene where the counselor receives a dvd from the cartel which, because of the set up by Westray (played by Brad Pitt) earlier in the film, we assume is a video of Laura's murder. The counselor's breakdown when he sees the dvd is extremely powerful and, in it, we are confronted by our own helplessness in the face of death.The theme of our helplessness is precisely why (I think) so many people are disappointed in this movie. They were expecting a ""drug-war"" thriller, a battle between good and evil, but, as Mr. Compson says in The Sound and the Fury (I am paraphrasing): when we wage war against the world and fate, we are not only destined to lose, there is never really even any fight, because there is no one to fight. We have all seen ""drug-war"" thrillers and we have certain expectations. This movie disappoints those expectations which, I think, is a good thing.For example, when Laura is kidnapped by the cartel. Here is the standard story that we have all seen a million times (that might be hyperbole): the cartel calls up the counselor and demands that he make reparations for the money he ""stole"" or his wife will die, they let him talk to his wife on the phone, the counselor vows to rescue her, puts together a scheme, meets some challenges on the way, but ultimately prevails (with lots of explosions, car chases and gun battles in between).Here is what we actually get: the counselor figures out that Laura has been kidnapped because she never shows up at their arranged meeting. No one from the cartel tries to contact him about it. No one from the cartel tries to make any kind of deal with him (the cartel is, in that sense, as inexorable as fate; you cannot negotiate or make bargains with death or god). The counselor reaches out to some friend of his, who puts him in touch with a high-ranking cartel member, they have one fairly short conversation on the phone, the counselor receives a dvd of his wife's murder, and he goes home. There is never even a shred of hope that the counselor might be able to get his wife back.The plot unfolds (or unravels) mechanically from the moment the drug deal goes wrong. It just disintegrates. I can understand why viewers who are used to taut, developing, spiraling plots would be disappointed with a decaying disintegrating plot but, personally, I found it a refreshing change of pace, and, I would have been far more disappointed if Cormac McCarthy had turned in a formulaic plot (one reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes, who I generally enjoy, was disappointed that the car chase scene ""lacked suspense"". I have two questions: first, would you really want to watch a lengthy car chase scene written by Cormac McCarthy? Is that the best use of his talents? And second, does anyone still get excited by car chase scenes?)There are also people who complained that the plot is ""confusing"". It is true, Cormac McCarthy does not waste time explaining things to his audience. He lets the audience figure things out for themselves. Personally, I think that is a good thing. I get very frustrated with ""exposition dialogue"" in movies and television, dialogue that states the obvious, or has no purpose other than filling the audience in. The plot of the movie is not really complicated enough to require that anyway. There are really only three moving pieces: the counselor (who is allied with Westray and Reiner), the drug cartel, and Malkina (who works for no one but herself).I give McCarthy credit for writing what I think is a well-crafted, non-formulaic plot, that is emotionally powerful. Still, this is certainly not a perfect movie. It suffers from a number of flaws that I think reviewers have nearly universally picked up on.The first and most obvious problem is the dialogue. The critics of this movie are describing the dialogue as ""pretentious"", ""pompous"", ""pseudo-profound"", and other similar descriptive terms. While I do not necessarily agree with those adjectives (the term ""pretentious"" is almost always misused, and terms like ""pseudo-profound"" are often used when people stare into a deep pool and are disappointed when all they see is their own reflection on the surface) but I agree with the general sentiment. There is some dialogue in this movie that might work in a novel (although I am not even sure about that) but seems very out of place on the screen (""the truth has no temperature""; ""it is like being in love with easeful death"" (a reference to Keats).There is also a lot of dialogue that I think is just wasted. For example, Westray spends a lot of time trying to convince the counselor that the drug cartels are seriously dangerous (""You might think there are things that they are incapable of but you'd be wrong""; ""They will cut out your liver and feed it to their dogs.""). I don't think, in this day and age, anyone but the hopelessly nave needs to be convinced that the drug cartels are dangerous and capable of horrific violence, and the counselor certainly seems worldly enough to grasp the risks of his venture (""Oh, you mean the drug cartel might actually kill me if things go wrong? I had never thought of that!""). It was necessary for Westray to tell the story of the snuff tape to set up the most devastating moment in the movie but all the other time he spends talking about how dangerous the cartel is seems wasted.The second problem I think has to do with the characters. None of them are all that likable, which is actually fine with me. I don't need to like characters but I need them to be interesting. There is one extremely interesting character in the movie: Malkina. The rest are sort of boring. We learn very little about the counselor or what makes him tick (Is he a good lawyer? An idealist? A scumbag who gets criminals out on technicalities?). We learn very little about Laura (Where did she meet the counselor? What does she do for a living? How does she feel about her fiance's involvement in the drug world?). We could say the same thing about all the other characters in the movie, except for Malkina.Malkina is quite a triumph, in my opinion. Cormac McCarthy is often criticized for the lack of female characters in his novels but, in this movie, the most interesting character is a woman. She is cruel, deceptive, cunning, and vicious. The scene where she goes to confession, just to mock the institution, along with the belief in God, is a brilliant little scene. Malkina clearly finds something disturbing about the fact that Laura is religious, it does not fit into her hedonistic, materialistic, nihilistic philosophy. She imagines that the priest must be getting off listening to the women talk about their sins (an attempt to fit religion into her own hedonistic philosophy) so she goes to test it out. Perhaps she imagines that she will be able to convert the priest to her own hedonism or perhaps she just wants her own disillusionment to be confirmed. There is, however, no doubt that without Malkina this movie would have been much less interesting.The movie has a lot of flaws. I do not think there are any living novelists who are better writers than Cormac McCarthy. There are probably some who are just as good, but none who are better. There are certainly lots of screenwriters who are better screenwriters than Cormac McCarthy but, then again, there are even more that are worse!",4,Better than the reviews would lead you to

Cameron Diaz gets the best lines in the entire movie but the one that stole my attention completely was the scene with Ruben Blades and how he conveys very profound thoughts in a few carefully chosen words.

The Counselor.The Counselor is a cautionary tale of how bad things happen to really, really, really stupid people. And I mean REALLY stupid people. Like, the wife who's lawyer husband flies to Amsterdam to buy her and ring and takes her to a pool party in Ciudad Juarez. No red flags there, missy, he's totally legit!Then you have said husband - a lawyer who likes to do legal gigs for shady people and hook up with ultra-shady people to make money on the side. Because if you're rich enough to fly to Amsterdam to buy your wife a ring, you totally need to kick it in Juarez with a moronic drug dealer who wears bad silk shirts and keeps cheetahs as pets. I see no risk there.And as for said moron... he apparently needs no business skills to survive in his violently competitive market. All he needs is a stupid rich lifestyle in an incredibly dangerous area. Because nothing bad happens to those people.I forgot to mention the super street smart cowboy dude who is in on the lawyer's drug deal, despite seeming too smart to have anything to do with him. He is very confident in his ability to vanish without a trace when something bad happens, and when something bad happens he promptly shacks up at a posh London hotel and bangs a random girl, who was planted to steal information from him. But this guy is smart, right? Oh wait, he was hanging out with idiot lawyer boy... nevermind.Ridley puts these four dumber-than-possible characters into a wild and crazy world where anyone can make a cameo appearance and not even have a point. Hey look, it's that guy from The Shield, and he's talking to some dude about a corpse in a barrel! Wow, profound.

I had to endure some of the worst dialogue and completely pointless scenes in order to get there, and to be honest it really wasn't worth it.

1632090,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00BEIYRQA,DanD,"[4, 6]","I've been a Cormac McCarthy fan for years; when his screenplay for THE COUNSELOR first came available, I immediately snatched a copy and read it in a couple of sittings.  I knew pretty much right away what I was getting into, of course; and I could also see how it might not translate accurately to the screen.Well, it translates pretty well.  The thing is, this is more of a filmed literary work than a movie.  Aside from a few flourishes from the supporting cast (a couple good scenes with Penelope Cruz, Brad Pitt doing his reliable Brad Pitt thing), the only actor who flexes much muscle here is Michael Fassbender (and he is utterly superb).  That's because THE COUNSELOR is more concerned with ideas: corruption, greed, collateral damage.  It's a conceptual and spiritual sequel to McCarthy's NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (you're probably more familiar with the Coen Brothers' film adaptation, though you should check out the novel, easily McCarthy's most accessible).  This film follows a nameless attorney's downward spiral into the crime world, where must face an unanswerable paradox: what do you do with a coincidence, in a world without coincidences?THE COUNSELOR starts slow, but gradually builds itself toward something resembling a plot.  Ridley Scott's direction is mostly sound, though his casting decisions are questionable.  Granted, there's not a lot Cameron Diaz could've done with her role (it's mostly allegorical), but one can't help but feel she's miscast (she's also not too great with McCarthy's dialogue).  The same goes for Javier Bardem, who at least still makes an effort.  Actor-wise, this is Fassbender's film, and he delivers a stellar, nuanced performance.  But ultimately, of course, this film belongs to Cormac McCarthy.  Be forewarned: that may not be what you're expecting or looking for.

1632101,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00BEIYRQA,Doug Park,"[6, 7]","Whew! I wasn't ready for this.WARNING: Many people will casually pick up and watch this film, noticing the prominent cast and hoping for just another good legal thriller that more or less follows the formula. Those people are in for a big unpleasant surprise. THE COUNSELOR will NOT warm the heart when justice is served in the end. This film also requires close attention and won't make much sense to people who just want to be entertained without having to think too hard. [Please note that I'm not trying to insult said people and am often among them myself.] Though gory and violent, THE COUNSELOR goes no farther in those areas than lots of other films do: It's the story itself that is so bleak and disturbing. Another thing: Depending upon interpretation, certain aspects may seem misogynistic and prove particularly alienating to many women.Though a true literary genius, novelist Cormac McCarthy is not known for his cheery optimism. In this venture into film writing, he reaches new depths of pessimism that sometimes border on the darkest nihilism. Nevertheless, there are obvious basic morals to be drawn from THE COUNSELOR.McCarthy spits in the face of so many storytelling conventions here, creating a tale that's seldom told but so often true. It's all about the young and recently engaged ""Counselor,"" played by Michael Fassbender, who finds himself succumbing to a shady deal with a worse-than-shady crowd. The plot flies in many directions, and the sheer number of characters can be a little overwhelming. It's hard to place where everyone fits in and the game each person is playing. The transitions are abrupt, which, for some reason, seems intentional even though it doesn't exactly work. In those respects, the storyline is indeed flawed, which is why I give this film four stars instead of five. It's essentially a video novel, not simply a film adaptation of a book, something that could hasten the development of a whole new subgenre of filming. Still, let's not forget that the first novels were badly plotted, the first suspense films unsuspenseful, the first poems badly rhymed, etc. This early effort in ""video novelization"" or whatever we choose to call it employs techniques that work all the time on paper but are harder to utilize on screen. The character development in particular just isn't quite there.Regardless, THE COUNSELOR is expertly filmed, well-acted, and compelling. Cameron Diaz especially stands out as Malkina, a character who's hard to forget no matter how much we may want to forget her. The larger-than-life dialogue is arresting in itself. This sort of script is hard to make work. Many films have tried it, but most have failed, and very few have succeeded this brilliantly. The early exchanges of dialogue between all the major sets of characters are important in foreshadowing and allowing the audience some clue of what's going on here and what will ultimately happen. I know that I missed some things on first view but am eager to watch this again. . .and again.",4,"""And the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining""",1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,3019,"['was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'this.WARNING', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'casually', 'pick', 'up', 'watch', 'film', 'noticing', 'prominent', 'cast', 'hoping', 'just', 'good', 'legal', 'thriller', 'more', 'less', 'formula', 'people', 'are', 'big', 'unpleasant', 'surprise', 'COUNSELOR', 'will', 'NOT', 'warm', 'heart', 'when', 'justice', 'served', 'end', 'film', 'also', 'close', 'attention', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'having', 'think', 'too', 'hard', '[', 'Please', 'note', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'insult', 'said', 'people', 'am', 'often', 'gory', 'violent', 'THE', 'COUNSELOR', 'farther', 'areas', 'lots', 'other', 'films', 'do', 'story', 'so', 'bleak', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'Depending', 'interpretation', 'certain', 'aspects', 'may', 'seem', 'misogynistic', 'prove', 'particularly', 'alienating', 'many', 'true', 'literary', 'genius', 'novelist', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'not', 'known', 'cheery', 'optimism', 'venture', 'film', 'writing', 'new', 'depths', 'pessimism', 'border', 'darkest', 'nihilism', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'obvious', 'basic', 'morals', 'be', 'drawn', 'THE', 'COUNSELOR.McCarthy', 'face', 'so', 'many', 'storytelling', 'conventions', 'here', 'creating', 'tale', 'seldom', 'told', 'so', 'often', 'true', 'young', 'recently', 'engaged', 'Counselor', 'played', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'who', 'succumbing', 'shady', 'deal', 'worse-than-shady', 'crowd', 'plot', 'flies', 'many', 'directions', 'sheer', 'number', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'overwhelming', 'hard', 'place', 'where', 'everyone', 'game', 'person', 'playing', 'transitions', 'are', 'abrupt', 'reason', 'intentional', 'even', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'work', 'respects', 'storyline', 'indeed', 'flawed', 'why', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'essentially', 'video', 'novel', 'not', 'simply', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'something', 'could', 'hasten', 'development', 'whole', 'new', 'subgenre', 'filming', 'Still', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'first', 'novels', 'were', 'badly', 'plotted', 'first', 'suspense', 'films', 'unsuspenseful', 'first', 'badly', 'rhymed', 'etc', 'early', 'effort', 'video', 'novelization', 'choose', 'call', 'techniques', 'work', 'time', 'paper', 'are', 'harder', 'utilize', 'screen', 'character', 'development', 'particular', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there.Regardless', 'THE', 'COUNSELOR', 'expertly', 'filmed', 'well-acted', 'compelling', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'especially', 'out', 'Malkina', 'character', 'who', 'hard', 'forget', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'may', 'want', 'forget', 'larger-than-life', 'dialogue', 'arresting', 'sort', 'script', 'hard', 'make', 'work', 'Many', 'films', 'have', 'tried', 'most', 'have', 'failed', 'very', 'few', 'have', 'succeeded', 'brilliantly', 'early', 'exchanges', 'dialogue', 'major', 'sets', 'characters', 'are', 'important', 'foreshadowing', 'allowing', 'audience', 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'what', 'will', 'ultimately', 'happen', 'know', 'missed', 'things', 'first', 'view', 'am', 'eager', 'watch', 'again', '.and', 'again']",The Counselor

But the script is an endless diatribe of philosophy from every character with whom the Counselor is concerned with. None of the characters are well-rounded, just thrown onto the palette. And we just don't care about any of them. Fassbender cruises through this, we just don't feel his pain until the end when he breaks down and even then, do we know why he needed this deal? He didn't seem to be poor. Diaz is woefully out of her depth here. We don't care about her either. She is the catalyst for the deal gone wrong...like she needs more money. We don't know anything about her occupation, her income, why she would let her boyfriend get killed, why she is so hateful and care-free.Arrrgggh I just didn't feel anything about anything with this film. And there are some random scenes...the biker talking about his dog-biscuits???? I mean what???Rosie Perez...her small scene, pivotal or not, gave no push.

Clearly he's enamored with McCarthy, read a script that played out as eloquent wordmanship, but forgot to apply any suspense or empathy...these are critical no?I've watched this twice because I want to like it. Scott's films have their own trademarks that I enjoy even with the volume down. Like Prometheus, we were anticipating something truly wunderkind but got an episode of Deep Space Nine; hanging off flimsy and pretentious philosophy...again lacking strong characters and suspense.Perhaps jumping from one project to the other has clouded Scott's judgement.

1632118,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BEIYRQA,Grady Harp,"[10, 13]","For those Cormac McCarthy fans this film will probably be disappointing. Cormac's novels bask in run-on sentences, philosophical tangents and just smart ideas while they accompany the well-paced story. This, however, is a straight screenplay, not an adaptation of one of his books, and therein lies the problem. If sitting still through endless conversations about grief, the meaning of life, the impact of loss on the human soul etc entertain you, then you'll love this very slow film. If that kind of thematic dialogue calls attention to itself purely for the sake of `profound thinking', then perhaps you will be disappointed with a film packed with excellent actors but lacking a credible story. Examples of seated dialogue: 'I suspect that we are ill-formed for the path we have chosen. Ill-formed and ill-prepared. We would like to draw a veil over all the blood and terror that have brought us to this place. It is our faintness of heart that would close our eyes to all of that, but in so doing it makes of it our destiny... But nothing is crueler than a coward, and the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining.' And more: `When it comes to grief, the normal rules of wealth do not apply. Because grief transcends value. A man would give entire nations to lift grief off his heart and yet, you cannot buy anything with grief, because grief is worthless.' When isolated and read (as in McCarthy's fine books) it works well, but place these words as a substitute for dialogue and it pretty much crashes and burns.The region is the El Paso/Suarez border. A rich and successful lawyer, the Counselor (Michael Fassbender), is about to get married to his fianc&eacute;e Laura (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) but soon becomes entangled in a complex drug plot with a middle-man known as Westray (Brad Pitt). The plan ends up taking a horrible twist and he must protect himself and his soon to be bride as the truth of the drug business is uncovered and targets are eliminated. The other characters who walk on and off the set include a diamond dealer (Bruno Ganz), a wealthy questionably legal dealer Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his all important mistress Malkina (Cameron Diaz), the jailed mother (Rosie Perez) of a druggie biker (Richard Cabral) - but they all have so little to do with what's going on (whatever that is) that they remain interesting cameos.

1632133,A11W5PP5FM494X,B00BEIYRQA,Jake H. -- Chicago,"[2, 7]","I like this kind of movie.  I like an intricate crime drama.  I like snappy, writerly dialogue.  I like an old-school noir sensibility -- something you might describe as sexy pessimism.  I like a collection of good looking actors, led by a knockout femme fatale.  I'm a big Robert Towne fan (writer of Chinatown).  Tequila Sunrise is an underrated classic.  I wish Hollywood made more of that sort of thing.  I bemoan today's lack of quality suspense films, and dearth of quality writing.  So, despite many bad reviews, I thought I had to give this film a try.  I thought it would at least have all of those things, and it did, especially the pessimism (in this case, nihilism).  And I thought, How bad can it be?  Well, I found out.  Yes, it had that fun writerly dialogue, but the film was executed so poorly in every other respect that, by the end of it, I thought it was about the worst, most dispiriting, most laughably bad movie I had seen in years.  If it had been populated by any characters one might have been moved to take an interest in, then it would have been an upsetting downer.  But it might at least have been an interesting movie.  As it is, it's just tedious and ridiculous and icky.The plot manages to be both thin and confusing.  I'm usually suspicious when people complain that they didn't get the movie, and I suspect that they just weren't paying attention.  Here, though, basic groundwork is needlessly held back, not just initially but for the whole film.  It's confusing because the characters -- who they are exactly, and what they're up to exactly, and why exactly -- are not explained.  We know that our main character is a criminal defense attorney for drug dealers, and that he lives lavishly.  We know that he's in love with Penelope Cruz, or, at least, in love with making love to her.  We know absolutely nothing about her except that she's cute and nice.  He has decided before the beginning of the film, for reasons unclear, to involve himself in the business end of his clients' business for the first time.  We know nothing else about him.  We don't know why he would risk his life and career to engage directly in a drug deal, except that, even as he is buying an expensive diamond ring, drives a Bentley, and lives in a modernist mansion, he is somehow hard up for cash.  We don't know what role exactly he would play in the contemplated transaction, what exactly it is (other than the movement of drugs across the country), or why his services, whatever they may be, would be useful or desirable or command a high price.  Anyway, he never appears desperate.  He never registers any emotions whatsoever, except at the end.  He merely reacts blandly and participates in empty chatter.  As a consequence, our main character, the film's namesake, never emerges as a real person.  He just comes across as a vacuous moron.Is he doing the drug deal to pay for the ring?  We're to understand that it's an expensive, high quality ring, and that it's an expression of his love for Cruz.  Anyway, it's not clear, like much else.  But, if that's the reason, no amount of smooth talk from the diamond merchant about the worthy meaning of adornment, no amount of literary irony whereby the adornment ends up risking the person it adorns, could lend credence to so risible a conceit.  Here's a tip: before getting in bed with a notoriously brutal Mexican drug cartel, consider a ring worth less than, say, your Bentley.  Or maybe you could finance the ring!  Many better options, ring-wise.Javier Bardem, as a drug dealer/presumable client, is entertaining -- the only character you sort of get.  He muses about this and that -- the thing about women, etc. -- and provides some of the foreshadowing.  (The movie has a lot of foreshadowing.  Don't introduce the machine that cuts the victim's carotid &#34;and sprays blood all over the spectators&#34; in Act I if you're not going to use it in Act III.)  He's living with Cameron Diaz, the villain/anti-heroine of the movie.  She's supposed to be tough, ruthless, savvy, with a whole philosophy to match -- something about the truth and beauty of being amoral.  She is repeatedly and unsubtly compared to a cheetah.  She sports an elaborate cheetah-spot tattoo and keeps a couple of big cats as pets.  She even, in one of the film's few amusing moments, humps a Ferrari, displaying an animal-like indifference to humping matter.  If all that sounds like fun, it could have been, except that Diaz doesn't make it.  She's got the look, but she can't read the lines -- or, at least, didn't in the chosen takes.  When suggested that her viewpoint is &#34;cold,&#34; she says, &#34;I don't believe that truth has a temperature.&#34;  That's a pretty good line.  When she says, it comes across as silly -- you don't believe it.  She's about as menacing as a valley girl.  And, even though she's supposedly a criminal mastermind, it's unclear what she ends up gaining or how.  As for Brad Pitt, I'm not sure who he is supposed to be other than a fount of grinning and sanctimonious advice.The movie is dark and, I think, is meant to be serious in its darkness.  Pulpy fun it ain't (especially when you realize what's probably on that disc we glimpse at the end).  But without convincing characters or situations, the darkness is unearned and artificial.  It comes across as merely sour, like bad milk.  You just want to spit it up, dump the rest down the drain, suppress the urge to vomit, and forget the whole thing.",1,Nifty Dialogue Can't Save Otherwise Rancid Trash,1394668800,"03 13,

The film stars Michael Fassbender as the eponymous Counselor--who gets in over his head in a drug deal around the troubled Juarez, Mexico/Texas border area--as well as Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz and Brad Pitt. The film deals with themes of greed, death, the primal instincts of humans and their consequences...or so says Wikipedia.Well, I'm not so sure about the theme of greed or primal instincts.  Sure, Fassbender's character needs, or thinks he needs, a few more dollars after he flies to Amsterdam to buy his beloved Laura (Penelope Cruz) a 3.9 carat diamond ring.  And Reiner, the Counselor's entrepreneurial friend played by Javier Bardem, does seem to revel in primal experience after his girl friend, Malkina (Cameron Diaz), who has a cheetah print tattoo and owns two pet cheetahs, makes love to his Ferrari.  I think that's what he's reveling in...she surely is.THE COUNSELOR is a wild ride, folks.  Very well done with snippets of one astonishing scene after another. And all with beautiful people living in beautiful places and wearing beautiful clothes.  Costume designer Janty Yates collaborated with Giorgio Armani to create the wardrobes for Fassbender and Cruz's characters.  Designer Paula Thomas dressed Cameron Diaz's character, Malkina, with about fifteen extravagant outfits accessorized with like and large jewelry. For Javier Bardem's character, Yates chose a widely colorful wardrobe that was mostly made up of pieces of Versace.  Bardem's hair was the actor's own idea and inspired by film producer Brian Grazer's hairdo. Brad Pitt plays a middle man in the drug deal and wears his cowboy hat and shoes well; it's his ""Thelma and Louise"" role updated.The movie does have a literary theme. Toward the end of the film, the Counselor seeks the advice of The Jefe (Rub&eacute;n Blades), a cartel kingpin, about his problems.  The Jefe quotes the Spanish poet Antonio Machado and recites a bit of his poem ""Campos de Castilla"" ...Caminante, no hay camino. Se hace camino al andar...which translates in its original context as: ""Wanderer, your footsteps are the road, and nothing more; wanderer, there is no road, the road is made by walking. By walking one makes the road, and upon glancing behind one sees the path that never will be trod again..."" He concludes by telling the Counselor to live with the choices he has made: ""You are the world you have created. And when you cease to exist, that world you have created will also cease to exist.""A Tampa Bay Times critic called this film a ""guilty pleasure.""

However, the promise of excellence is unfulfilled. As the story unfolds, it falters. Ultimately, the storytelling technique resorts to telegraphing the dramatic punches.It's a pity: there are some scenes - especially early in the movie- which I thought were clever and indeed funny- as black comedy.The opening scene involving Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz creates an expectation that you are going to see a movie which is challenging and engaging- indeed confronting, particularly as you know the talent involved in the making of the movie.But, the interesting start is not sustained. As the story progresses, it becomes at times pretentious and even in poor taste (the scene involving Cameron Diaz and the Ferrari, for example). Sadly, the entertainment and engagement level continues to decline as the movie progresses, and it becomes repellent.Most of the characters are very unsympathetic (Penelope Cruz is an exception), and the story presents a gloomy and nihilistic view of the world.I suspect the writer sought to present a confronting allegorical tale, but ultimately, it's a tale told in a grim and tiresome fashion.With all the talent involved in this movie, it is a pity the result was so disappointing.

I swear I was into the movie 30 minutes and I still had no idea what the hell was going on, who was the bad guy, who was the good guy, was there a cop? I don't know.  Somehow Fassbender has involved himself into a drug deal to get himself out of debt.  Oh and by the way, Fassbender has the cash on hand to fly himself to Amsterdam to meet with a Diamond Cutter and buys a flawless 3.9 carat diamond for Cruz.  I guess they didn't have any decent diamonds in Texas.  He meets with Bardim who I assume is the dealer?  Bardim who is involved with Diaz is a club owner who is also going into business with Fassbender, I think?  Brad Pitt is some Cowboy dude who is brokering the drugs from Fassbender to get the from Mexico to Chicago in the back of a sewage truck (that apparantly has DOT permission to cross the Border from Mexico to Chicago?)  Oh my god it just gets worse and worse....4 - Scott did an absolute horrible job tying anything together.  I'm sure when they all sat down at the initial screening, Ridley and his gang of cronies were patting themselves on the back for scoring such a large cast of A-listers that there was no way this moving was going to be a flop.

It is Oscar Sunday and today I bring you my review on: The Counselor.In the movie we get introduced to a guy who is known throughout the movie simply as, Counselor. Mr.Counselor lives a pretty above decent lifestyle: the nice car, house, beautiful girlfriend. But one thing that is apparent early on is that he has ties to some pretty dangerous people or people with bad dealings. An example would be Counselor and one character discussing a drug deal. But without giving too much away, here are more details on why I choose to review this movie.First, the characters. I enjoyed how well each actor personified his/her role in the movie. The story line has a dark tone; and I don't mean grotesque or horrifying, but more like a cunning, devious feel to it. The Counselor is not exactly unpredictable, but there are times when you are not always sure who to trust. The Counselor is not great but fortunately for the viewer, it does has some good moments.I have read a lot of the reviews for this movie specifically. As for my final thought, it would be to say that Ridley Scott certainly has not made a classic or movie to completely rave about with The Counselor, but it is an intriguing, mentionable addition to his filmography as a director.

When I first saw the trailer for this film I thought it was going to be incredible. I mean how could it not be, with one of the greatest directors of all time in Ridley Scott, a fantastic writer who's adapted novel won Best Picture (No Country for Old Men) in Cormac McCarthy and an excellent cast which includes Javier Bardem (Oscar Winner for No Country), Penelope Cruz, Michael Fassbender and Cameron Diaz, not to mention a smaller role from non other than Brad Pitt.I watched the unrated extended cut, which isn't always better, but since Ridley Scott essentially invented the Director's Cut I thought it would probably be the best version to watch, in spite of all the bad press. The first and most obvious problem with the movie is it's pacing. This will probably turn most people off, immediately calling the film 'boring'. Unfortunately the pacing really interrupts a smooth flow of the movie and steals a sense of desire and motivation from the viewers. While there is a story underneath there somewhere it is hidden beyond a collection of philosophy and seemingly unnecessary vulgar stories.

1632166,A1G698SYJIVGAX,B00BEIYRQA,Kevin Berne,"[5, 8]","This is a complicated yet great movie, I will not elaborate on that any further and while many people don't seem to get this movie this should not detract anyone from discovering it for themselves.The reason for me writing this is being fed up with studio politics (again!) concerning the two versions of this movie contained within this edition. I have had it with studios suggesting to us movie fans that obviously and miraculously  only inferior versions of their movies are shown in cinemas and that we as fans would owe it to ourselves to buy the consecutive home release of these films because only they contain the only true cut. So, this version features both the 1.57 hrs theatrical cut as well as the 2.17 hrs extended cut. The operative word here is ""extended"". This longer version contains an audio commentary by the film's director, Ridley Scott. In this commentary, he states multiple times that the extended version is just that: extended. It is not a director's cut by any means, all of the scenes that were taken out were deleted for a reason and are not meant to be within the movie at all. Having watched both cuts I find the theatrical and therefore director's cut of the movie to be perfect at slightly under two hours running time. The extended scenes in the longer version do not add anything substantial, useful or relevant but they slow the movie down quite a bit, which hurts it since pacing is very important in a film that is mostly comprised of people having high end conversations. To sum it up, the extended cut may be interesting in terms of getting a glimpse into the evolution of a movie, the way the movie is advertised however is just misleading and all the numerous internet reviewers that go on about how much better this movie is in its elongated version obvioulsy either do not share the director's vision or simply don't know what they are doing having bought into the studio BS. On a side note, this keeps happening to a lot of Ridley Scott films. Gladiator for example was a fantastic movie in its theatrical version, and even when released also in a extended cut a disgruntled Ridley Scott rang with himself not to say anything wrong in the special edition DVD/BD introduction. He even then specifically stated that the theatrical version was the director's cut and that the longer version was for enthusiasts at best. The same thing happened with American Gangster, in the commentary of which Scott described in detail why which scene had to be cut only to have them reinserted by the studio in the extended cut DVD/BD and sold as the superior version. Same case with Black Hawk Down, by the way. It should also be mentioned that whenever people claim that a longer cut was no problem since it contains anything anyway these people should consider the fact that the movie's soundtrack has to be heavily altered, remixed and repeated to accommodate the additional footage, thereby in fact altering the dynamic of even unchanged scenes. Lengthening a movie is mostly a bad idea contrary to common believe, and if the longer version would be the director's cut it would gladly be called that by the studios: a ""director's cut""!I would like to mention perhaps the most striking example of a director's cut: Ridley Scott's brother, the late Tony Scott and my favorite director, made the movie Revenge in 1990. Due to studio pressure, reshoots had to be done to artificially create a more elaborate love story in the first half of the movie. In 2007 Tony reconstructed his directors cut of the movie by removing almost 30 minutes of material and just reinserting a few new takes, also many takes were altered. This shorter version was much better because it acknowlegded itself as being a movie, not a book and therefore trying to keep a proper pacing without boring the viewer to death. The point I am trying to make is that a movie is basically created three times: In writing, in shooting and finally in editing. While no one would buy a movie the sript of which has been changed for the home release or that was reshot with different actors, yet studios have made us believe the heavily recut and elongated versions they sell us would actually improve a movie.

1632183,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BEIYRQA,M. Oleson,"[2, 5]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.With a cast of Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt and Cameron Diaz, I just had to see this film.  Add one of my favorite directors, Ridley Scott and story teller Cormac McCarthy and this has to be one of the better films of the year, right.  Well, no.  McCarthy hands off his novel but this time, also has responsibility for the screenplay.  Unfortunately he fumbles the ball.The story is about an unnamed defense attorney, only known as counselor (Fassbender) who gets into debt.  Although it is never really explained, part of it likely comes with the price of a huge diamond ring he buys for his betrothed, Laura (Cruz).  In one scene, which is indicative of the problem of the movie, the counselor is talking to Laura, telling her how much he loves her.  Now I can get into a little love talk, but none of this one way communication is realistic or even interesting, just long winded sappy dialog.  I found myself trying to identify the cool song playing softly in the background (Neil Young?).  Scott and his production team do get the little things right.  In addition to a good soundtrack, the movie looks great.  Both the counselor and the local narcotic kingpin, Reiner (Bardem) have homes to die for.The counselor, needing some quick cash calls upon a onetime client, Reiner, to hook him up with the transportation of some coke.  He gets in over his head and innocently changes events that allow the cocaine to fall into the hands of a competitor.  Now everyone is in trouble from the Mexican cartel that runs things.  The best thing in the movie is Bardem as the somewhat slimy but fun loving Reiner.  His girlfriend, Malkina (Diaz) is also a piece of work.  The scene where she has sex with Reiner's yellow Ferrari remains, unfortunately, stuck in my head.  But Reiner's play-by-play recounting is hilarious.Scott and McCarthy clearly had their sights set on ""No Country For Old Men"" neo noir style.

1632184,A222AIW06ERYM2,B00BEIYRQA,Moses Avalon,"[0, 2]","First, let me say that I agree with another reviewer who brilliantly made fun of those who hated this movie, and give it one star, because they thought it was too confusing. That is true. This is a taunt, thoughtful, psychological thriller. It's not for those who see names like Brad Pitt and Penelope Cruz and think it's going to be a mindless action film.You have to pay attention, fill in a few blanks for yourself, and have a basic understanding of the drug world, at least the drug world taught to us by Hollywood.If you have that you will likely enjoy this movie very much. It's definitely a &#34;guy flick.&#34; It is uncomplimentary to women in almost every way imaginable. Exploiting both stereotypes of how shallow yet ruthless women can be.For that reason I deduct a star. The characters could've been better flushed out especially given the level of talent attracted. most every character in this film is a philosopher and has their moments when they drone on for a page or two about the meaning of life as seen through the eyes of those in the drug world. It gets a little tiring after the fourth or fifth time. There are also some logic problems as characters seem smart enough to figure out A,B,C, but not smart enough to to figure out D,E, and F.  But most people tend not to realize that actors don't write their own dialogue. They are paid to say what's on the page the way the director tells them to say it.The real credit here for anything you like about this movie goes to Ridley Scott.

The Counselor is one such piece of cinematic claptrap and let me state right up front what I reckon is the one and only thing wrong with this turgid turkey: the writing. God's Holy Trousers but Cormac McCarthy is about as clueless about screenwriting as Charlie Rose is about everything. Besides Fassbender's title character, who just keeps muttering ""Jesus"" every five minutes in startlingly fake mental distress, the ceaseless catalogue of bite-sized profundities spouted by nearly every other character makes The Counselor sound like a dubbed into English version of one of those unspeakable French movies from the 60s written and directed by some self-appointed intellectual knob--Godard at his most obnoxiously supercilious springs easily to mind. ""The truth has no temperature"" intones a laughably unsinister Cameron Diaz. ""Gimme a farking break"" I intone right back at the screen. Then this doozy oozes to the surface, courtesy of a clearly embarrassed Bruno Ganz, a diamond dealer: ""To partake of the stone's endless destiny, is that not the meaning of adornment? To enhance the beauty of the beloved is to acknowledge both her frailty and the nobility of that frailty. At our noblest, we announce to the darkness that we will not be diminished by the brevity of our lives."" At this point I was frantically looking about for someone to shoot me. But this preposterous film just kept rolling on interminably. And then what about the countless cack-brained observations about women? Here's one of Javier Bardem's unintentionally hilarious pronouncements: ""Men are attracted to flawed women too of course, but their illusion is that they can fix them. They just want to be entertained. The truth about women is that you can do anything to them except bore them."" Well said, Javier, but did you know that the truth about you in this film is that you look silly in that hair and decidedly uncomfortable to boot? In fact if good actors of the calibre of Fassbender, Bardem, Pitt and Cruz can be made to look like total amateurs, made to seem so incredibly ill at ease, then the lines they have to deliver must be very bad indeed. I've read nearly all of McCarthy's novels but stopped admiring them when he started pandering to the masses with the less-than-stellar Border Trilogy--everything after these three went further downhill as far as I was concerned, not necessarily bad writing, just sort of lacklustre and ho hum. But this first foray in film is most definitely bad writing, comically and cringe-inducingly bad, and I just guess I am astonished that this dude could cook up this crap and think it worth anybody's time. Ridley Scott also resembles McCarthy in my estimation in that he too started out with a few humdingers but somewhere round about the time of Gladiator started to lose his considerable movie mojo. At any rate these two old geezers should have known better than to punish the public with this putrid picture. To accentuate the one star rating above I will add my own personal rating for tripe of this magnitude: Eleven thumbs down.",1,Burn before viewing,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,3334,"['Normally', ""'m"", 'sort', 'nitwit', 'instantly', 'dismiss', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'dig', 'quickly', 'move', 'something', 'better', 'occasionally', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'down', 'chute', 'so', 'ghastly', 'get', 'bloody', 'bleeding', 'burned', 'bits', 'feel', 'impelled', 'put', 'index', 'finger', 'keyboard', 'Counselor', 'one', 'such', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'claptrap', 'let', 'state', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'what', 'reckon', 'one', 'only', 'thing', 'wrong', 'turgid', 'turkey', 'writing', 'God', 'Holy', 'Trousers', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'clueless', 'about', 'screenwriting', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'everything', 'Fassbender', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'just', 'muttering', 'Jesus', 'five', 'minutes', 'startlingly', 'fake', 'mental', 'distress', 'ceaseless', 'catalogue', 'bite-sized', 'profundities', 'spouted', 'nearly', 'other', 'character', 'Counselor', 'sound', 'dubbed', 'English', 'version', 'one', 'unspeakable', 'French', 'movies', '60s', 'written', 'directed', 'self-appointed', 'intellectual', 'knob', 'Godard', 'most', 'obnoxiously', 'supercilious', 'springs', 'easily', 'mind', 'truth', 'temperature', 'laughably', 'unsinister', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Gim', 'farking', 'break', 'intone', 'right', 'back', 'screen', 'Then', 'doozy', 'surface', 'courtesy', 'clearly', 'embarrassed', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'diamond', 'dealer', 'partake', 'stone', 'endless', 'destiny', 'not', 'meaning', 'adornment', 'enhance', 'beauty', 'beloved', 'acknowledge', 'frailty', 'nobility', 'frailty', 'noblest', 'announce', 'darkness', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'diminished', 'brevity', 'lives', 'point', 'was', 'frantically', 'looking', 'someone', 'shoot', 'preposterous', 'film', 'just', 'kept', 'rolling', 'interminably', 'then', 'what', 'countless', 'cack-brained', 'observations', 'women', 'Here', 'one', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'pronouncements', 'Men', 'are', 'attracted', 'flawed', 'women', 'too', 'course', 'illusion', 'can', 'fix', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'truth', 'women', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'Well', 'said', 'Javier', 'did', 'know', 'truth', 'film', 'look', 'silly', 'hair', 'decidedly', 'uncomfortable', 'boot', 'fact', 'good', 'actors', 'calibre', 'Fassbender', 'Bardem', 'Pitt', 'Cruz', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'look', 'total', 'amateurs', 'made', 'seem', 'so', 'incredibly', 'ill', 'ease', 'then', 'lines', 'have', 'deliver', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'indeed', ""'ve"", 'read', 'nearly', 'McCarthy', 'novels', 'stopped', 'admiring', 'when', 'started', 'pandering', 'masses', 'less-than-stellar', 'Border', 'Trilogy', 'everything', 'three', 'went', 'further', 'downhill', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'writing', 'just', 'sort', 'lacklustre', 'ho', 'hum', 'first', 'foray', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'bad', 'writing', 'comically', 'cringe-inducingly', 'bad', 'just', 'guess', 'am', 'astonished', 'dude', 'could', 'cook', 'up', 'crap', 'think', 'anybody', 'time', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'also', 'McCarthy', 'estimation', 'too', 'started', 'out', 'few', 'humdingers', 'somewhere', 'round', 'time', 'Gladiator', 'started', 'lose', 'considerable', 'movie', 'mojo', 'rate', 'two', 'old', 'geezers', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'punish', 'public', 'putrid', 'picture', 'accentuate', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'will', 'add', 'own', 'personal', 'rating', 'tripe', 'magnitude', 'Eleven', 'thumbs', 'down']",The Counselor

1632191,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BEIYRQA,Paul Allaer,"[5, 8]","""The Counselor"" (2013 release; 117 min.) brings the story of a lawyer (played by Michael Fassbender), whom everyone calls ""counselor"" and whose real name we never learn and who wants to get in on a ""deal"". As the movie opens, we see the counselor and his girlfriend Laura (played by Penelope Cruz) making out in bed before the counselor is flying out to Amsterdam to buy her a large engagement diamond (I suppose the producers don't know that it's not Amsterdam, but nearby Antwerp, Belgium which is the diamond capital of the world). Back in El Paso, TX, we get to know another couple, Reiner (played by Javier Bardem--in real life the husband of Penelope Cruz, incidentally) and Malkina (played by Cameron Diaz), living an extravagant life style. The counselor pleads with Reiner to get in on a ""deal"" (it's never explained exactly what that deal is, other than we can assume it's a drug deal). Reiner introduces the counselor to a middleman named Westray (played by Brad Pitt), who cautions the counselor against it. Meanwhile, in a separate story line we meet Ruth (played by Rosie Perez), who's serving time in prison and her court-appointed lawyer is the counselor. Ruth asks him for a favor, namely to bail out her son, who just got arrested for going 206 MPH on his motorbike. At this point we are not even half-way into the movie. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this movie was written by noted author Cormac McCarthy, he of such novels as All the Pretty Horses, The Road, and No Country For Old Men, all of which were turned into an interesting, if not successful, movie. If you add that this movie was directed by none other than Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, and last year's Prometheus, just to name those), and you also see the all-star cast attached to this movie, you can't help but have high expectations. Alas, it was not to be. The finer points of the plot are simply impossible to follow, as there are too many characters and subplots, and not enough explanations. But do not despair, there are some real pluses to this movie, none more so than the all-star cast performances. The movie features several Ridley Scott alumni: Michael Fassbender (also in last year's Prometheus) gives a gamely performance in the title role, but even better is Brad Pitt (also in Thelma & Louise) as the slick middleman. This movie has gained some notoriety for the (in)famous car-sex/self-gratifying scene from Cameron Diaz. To be honest, I found it off-putting and about as sexy as watching the grass grow or the paint dry. I will take the far more subtle opening scene with Penelope Cruz over that any day. Really enjoyed Rosie Perez and Bruno Ganz in their small roles. Last but not least, the movie soundtrack (from up-and-coming Daniel Pemberton) is quite good too.I had seen the trailer for ""The Counselor"" a couple of times, and given the writer-director-all star cast, I was really looking forward to this movie. I went to see it right away when it opened today. The screening I saw this at tonight here in Cincinnati was poorly attend, and that does not bode well for this movie commercially. All that aside, if you go into this with low expectations, I still think it is worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",4,3.5 stars...

There are two films I know that have the darkest, most nihilistic endings for a protagonist in the history of film.  Fritz Lang's ""Scarlet Street"" which leaves the main character alive but having lost his very identity; the other is this one.Ignore the bad reviews.  ""The Counselor"" is a first-class film with extraordinary characters and great filmmaking skill.  Michael Fassbender is great as usual as the Counselor whose one mistake destroys his soul.

1632207,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00BEIYRQA,Robert Hayes,"[0, 2]","THE COUNSELOR is a visually stunning movie with good performances by its star-studded cast, but the overly talky nature of the film made it feel like a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive movie. The story is rather simple: An unnamed lawyer, referred to only as &#34;Counselor&#34; (Fassbender) gets more than he bargains for when he enters into a one-time drug deal. Most of the movie is composed of these philosophically heady conversations and salacious anecdotes. While I would expect a movie to have some of these attributes, having a movie almost entirely composed of them starts to wear down on you a little bit. Fortunately, there were a few moments that moved the story along. Even still, they were few and far between (especially with the extended cut I watched). One part I thought was slightly miscast was Cameron Diaz as Malkina, Reiner's (Bardem) cheetah-loving mistress. There was an icy quality to her character and performance, but I didn't really buy her as somebody who wasn't American (she was supposed to be Argentinian). There are also several glorified cameo roles where they show up, talk for a little bit and then exit the picture. Most of the what they said had nothing to do with the story at all, and only served as mouthpieces for Cormac McCarthy's heavy-handed dialogue. Speaking of the dialogue, the script was the first one written by McCarthy directly for the screen, and it shows. He may be a high-caliber novelist, but he sorely needed someone to keep his style in check (like the Coen Bros. on NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Ridley Scott did an impeccable job as usual in delivering a visually compelling film, with a few great action sequences (as well as one scene with Cameron Diaz which I will not spoil...suffice it to say, you won't have seen anything like it before). However, the script supporting it just isn't disciplined enough to the make the movie work like it should. One other nice thing I could say is that I enjoyed the score, which punctuated at all the right moments and was never overpowering. Generally speaking, I count this as an interesting misfire.

This is a layman's impression of a disturbing piece of art. Disturbing, as in why we came, and art, as in the most brilliant colors. Given art is in your eye; this movie is not for everyone. It was for me. I was left thinking about it, moving the pieces around to find hidden combinations, unlocking revelations. My grandfather, at 95, said to me &#34; You know why I lived so long? I have been Very Careful...&#34; Now that is deep, and the characters in this story exist on the edge of the line between too much and not enough. &#34; When you cease to exist, this World you have created also ceases to exist. &#34;While the general package was what I have been waiting for from Hollywood for months, it does suffer from a common problem that many films seem to share lately; bad audio fidelity. As a consequence, it is hard to get the intricate details in every word of dialogue, and that is a MUST to stay connected to the plot. Yes, there is a very well defined plot, but it is elusive enough without having to strain to make out what was said. I hate subtitles, so that's why 4 stars. We dont all have noise cancelling home theaters, so PLEASE MIX THE AUDIO FOR AVERAGE TV!!!

The movie was really just too slow for me to get into. The main problem for me was that the movie was nothing more then 10-15 min scenes of long dialog conversations that were so jumbled that halfway through it just became confusing. It could just be me but each scene didn't seem to connect smooth to the next one and it was just too confusing to follow.

1632249,A3H72OSXBBNKXH,B00BEIYRQA,W. Wilson,"[4, 5]","One of the things I think that differentiates McCarthy from a vast majority of authors is how he seldom spends time explaining things. It's almost provocative (and oftentimes confusing) but the payoff, the message, is tremendous: if someone were to read a piece by McCarthy, that person is treated with a respect found nearly no place else. In a phrase, he's saying &#34;You're smart enough where I don't have to tell you everything.&#34; One might also venture to say that he's trying to capture the ambiguity of reality, which is kind of a feat in and of itself. That's what he has done with The Counselor. You aren't told everything; you aren't let into any of the characters heads and you are not allowed to know explicitly what drives them. Instead, you are an observer, like in real life, trying desperately to keep up with the way that these people are all about. This is NOT for everybody. One of the previous reviews called it &#34;lyrical&#34; and I think that's quite apt. The characters often speak metaphorically and it's left up to the viewer to decide exactly what those words were meant to imply. It's like one long, visceral poem where at the end, you may be unsure of its intent, but you know that whatever it wanted you to feel, you felt it.This film is for literary and film-focused people. It's a study, not a blockbuster, and it never seeks to even pretend that it is. The performances by the central cast are all phenomenal (not to mention from the auxiliary cast and an awesome and appropriate cameo by Dean Norris!), chewing up the dialogue. At times it felt like a stage production, but that, I believe, is to the benefit of the film. The score is also tremendous, not in the booming fanfare kind of way, but more along the lines of what Gustavo Santaolalla did in The Last of Us; mostly subtle so as not to distract from the (frequently) difficult to follow (but absolutely satisfying) dialogue, but &#34;loud&#34; enough to keep things from getting stale.Again, this is not a blockbuster, so for those expecting set piece after set piece, seek it elsewhere.
