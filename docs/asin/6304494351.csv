I saw it in the Spring of '79 on it's opening day on a double-bill with a film I've long since forgotten.  If there were five people in the audience that would have been alot.  I remember a couple of cute girls about my age sitting a few rows behind me getting weepy about the movie.  At that time I had the self-esteem of a doorknob so naturally I didn't approach them.  I digress for sure.  Bottom line, the film works as an affecting romance but falls short as family drama.  The love story between fledgling singer Michael Ontkean and aspiring hearing impaired dancer Amy Irving is palpable and touching.  Buyer beware because there are intermittent intrusions by Ontkean's annoying family.  Viveca Lindfors, however, has an effective turn as Irving's protective mother.

425843,A3IXC749UVCXWF,6304494351,Sabrina M. Messenger,"[4, 4]","Yes, ""Voices"" is a love story, but it's not a glittery fairy tale in the style of current romantic films. Rather it's about the romance one can find in reality. It's the story of two ordinary residents of the gritty working class city of Hoboken, NJ who lived in two different worlds.Drew Rithman, (Ontkean) is a truck driver who dreamed of becoming a rock star. Rosemarie Lemon, (Irving) was a teacher from an overprotective upper middle class family. She longed to become a professional dancer. Both of them had families who constantly discouraged them and tried to hold them back at every turn. Both felt very misunderstood by their families and friends.If they had followed the 'rules' of their families, Drew and Rosemarie would've never met. Yet, the two people did meet each other. They got to know each other and they eventually discovered that despite their different lives, they had common ground, and that despite the lack of support from their families, they could still be happy together and still encourage each other to achieve whatever it is they wanted.All of the actors did a fine job, but Irving's performance really stands out in this specific film. She had very little dialogue but her expressions and movements spoke volumes.Unfortunately, the late 1970s and early 1980s were not the best years for romantic movies at the cinema. It just wasn't the general public's taste, and critic seemed to absolutely despise the genre. In fact, the New York Times did its very best to bury this film with a very cynical and condescendingly negative review. Other critics reviews were mixed. Truth of the matter is that it Voices was considered a box office failure.However, in the opinion of this movie enthusiast, ""Voices"" was a wonderful movie that succeeds in touching the hearts of those viewers of independent thinking who don't or won't blindly accept the opinions of professional movie critics like just so many sheep. As far as I'm concerned, Voices didn't get half the attention it should've received back in 1979.Despite the reviewers calling it ""so-so"" and ""predictable"", to me wasn't wasn't just another sappy run-of-the-mill Romeo and Juliet style chick flick.  The first time I saw Voices, it was clear to me that this movie was done with heart and passion, and really seemed more like an art film than a commercial release.  In fact, when ""Voices"" was released to theatres back in the Spring of 1979, it was considered by some people to be a very important 'breakthrough' movie.What made ""Voices"" so special and different than other movies in the romance genre?Well, Rosemarie, the female protagonist in this movie, was hearing impaired, and in those days few if any movies featured people with disabilities in romantic roles! Looking back, it's hard to believe that there was actually a time when people actually had the kind of misconceptions of disabled person that Voices addressed, but they did. Some honestly believed that deaf people could not become dancers, or do anything but be deaf! In fact, 30 years ago the term ""deaf"" and ""dumb"" (implying stupid rather than not being able to speak) was synonymous...and a considerable number of people were still being institutionalized instead of remaining in the mainstream.  I can still remember how people told ""Helen Keller"" jokes back then...that's how ignorant people were about deaf culture back then.Voices"" was one of several films that was instrumental in debunking the myth that deaf people were unintelligent or incapable of having talents and skills...or that it was a bad idea for them to be romantically involved with anyone, hearing or deaf. This movie, at that time, was one of the first full length feature films to demonstrate that people with disabilities in general (and hearing impaired people in particular) can still live full, happy normal romantic lives...and that with loving and supportive people in their lives, they can still go for their dreams and do most if not all the things that abled bodied people do.Yet, this movie also had its bit of controversy, too...from the deaf community itself!According to a 1991 book on American Sign Language published by Galluadet University press, there were a number of deaf actors who were very upset that a hearing actor, Amy Irving was selected over a deaf actor for the role of Rosemarie Lemon. Despite the fact that Amy understands ASL, has a credible ""deaf speaking voice"" and has a deaf sister who taught at a school for the deaf, the actors disagreed with her being casted in the movie. They saw it as discrimination.In fact, some of those actors formed a group called ""Coalition Against Voices"" and protested at the San Francisco premiere of the film, not so much to encourage a boycott of ""Voices"" but to make the powers that be in the film industry aware of their existence and of the discrimination that deaf people faced each day! Because of the demonstration, MGM made the promise to use more deaf actors in future films...that promised helped to pave the way for many hearing impaired actors, including actors like Marlee Matlin whom you may remember in her Oscar winning role in the 1986 film ""Children Of A Lesser God."" It's interesting when you consider that Matlin went on to compete in the reality show ""Dancing With The Stars"" in 2008. She accomplished in real life what some people back in the 70s would have said was ""impossible!""At any rate, I always felt this movie had a positive and empowering message for both hearing and hearing impaired alike.Something else I love about this film? The theme song! The theme song can often determine the success or failure of a romantic film...and to me ""I Will Always Wait For You"" is the perfect song for demonstrating the love between Drew and Rosemarie, and also describing their promise to each other to be there for each other, to make time for each other, and to be supportive of each others goals and dreams. This lovely song was penned by prolific songwriter Jimmy Webb and sung by former Guess Who member Burton Cummings.I know this film is difficult to find, but if anyone has the opportunity to view this very special movie in this year, the 30th anniversary since its release, they really should do so.",5,A beautiful but underrated film I've not forgotten in 30 years,1239408000,"04 11,
