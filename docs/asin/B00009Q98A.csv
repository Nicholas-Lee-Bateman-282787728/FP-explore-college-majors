756705,AYUK7W0DRBZ8A,B00009Q98A,"Arbela ""Amazon Woman""","[5, 5]","but a great Yoga DVD for those with some experience.Yee does not spend a lot of time on alignment, which can be dangerous for beginners.  The comment on feeling it in the ""lower back"" from a couple of reviewers is a red flag right there.  Not that one cannot have some normal soreness in that region, but busting out Yoga poses without proper instruction can easily lead to lower back strain.  So if you're new to Yoga, I would look elsewhere.Those of you with some experience, Yee's practice starts out slow, but it's a nice way to warm up.  He gradually builds.  I'm a fan of Bryan Kest, Shiva Rea and Baron Baptiste, and I would say Yee's practice is as vigorous.  Not a lot of variety here, but sometimes it's good to pull back and really work a few poses in detail.  I was tired afterwards!He does move a little too fast for me in the seated poses ~ I like to linger and sink in ~ so that's the reason I gave it 4 out of 5.  Kest is great for letting you hang in a pose, so now I resent it when I'm not allowed to do so.Beginners, look into Yoga Journal's Basics DVDs.  The alignment instruction is great.  After that and maybe spending a little time at an Anusara or Iyengar studio, by all means...pick up this DVD.  :oD",4,Like others have said ~ not for beginners...,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,1226,"['great', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'experience.Yee', 'not', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'alignment', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'beginners', 'comment', 'feeling', 'lower', 'back', 'couple', 'reviewers', 'red', 'flag', 'right', 'there', 'Not', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'normal', 'soreness', 'region', 'busting', 'out', 'Yoga', 'poses', 'proper', 'instruction', 'can', 'easily', 'lead', 'lower', 'back', 'strain', 'So', ""'re"", 'new', 'Yoga', 'would', 'look', 'elsewhere.Those', 'experience', 'Yee', 'practice', 'out', 'slow', 'nice', 'way', 'warm', 'up', 'gradually', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'would', 'say', 'Yee', 'practice', 'as', 'vigorous', 'Not', 'lot', 'variety', 'here', 'good', 'pull', 'back', 'really', 'work', 'few', 'poses', 'detail', 'was', 'tired', 'afterwards', 'move', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'seated', 'poses', '~', 'linger', 'sink', '~', 'reason', 'gave', '4', '5', 'Kest', 'great', 'letting', 'hang', 'pose', 'so', 'now', 'resent', 'when', ""'m"", 'not', 'allowed', 'do', 'so.Beginners', 'look', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'Basics', 'DVDs', 'alignment', 'instruction', 'great', 'maybe', 'spending', 'little', 'time', 'Anusara', 'Iyengar', 'studio', 'means', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'oD']",N/A

Rodney Yee's Total Body Workout is a graceful power yoga practice that will enhance your well-being and create superior endurance, strength & flexibility. I have been practicing yoga on & off since 1998 but have almost exclusively taken up my practice to include yoga (3x/week vinyasa/power) and walking (3x/week) for the past 6 months.  I was into strenuous aerobics & weight training for the better part of a decade and was feeling really burned out & just constantly tired (physically & mentally).  I always knew that yoga would center me and create a feeling of inner peace but was pushing myself to the limit with hard core workouts that left me unsatisfied.Now I practice my yoga and have not only enhanced my fitness level but feel grounded and present in my everyday life.  Nothing will make me go back to torturing myself through workouts again.  I'm leaner, stronger, more toned and most importantly, I feel finally happy in my own skin.

I was challenged by the back bends, and did a couple rounds, but I had to back off at the end. I was very warmed up and flexible and learned slight adjustments to put myself further into the pose.

This unfortunately is not the case with Rodney Yee.  Yee masks his lack of practical innovation with bland repetition and overly stylized movements indicative of a person who has tried hard to bring show off dance moves to yoga.  It is easy to create a workout where I do A, B poses, then A, B, C poses, then A, B, C, D poses, etc.  This kills time and creates the illusion of physical transformation through variation on a theme.  There is no question when I do Brian Kest or Baron Baptiste that I truly feel worked out.  I did Yee's Power Yoga for a week, grew bored with it, then placed it at the bottom of my Power Yoga DVD pile.  Even though he is somewhat comprehensive with back bends, plow poses, and upturned bow, his introduction is essentially a time killer of ineffectual gesturing and movements which do very little to stimulate the body.  I will say this is Yee's best DVD.  At least he's not insulting my intelligence as he has on virtually every other workout of his that I own.

The level of poses is not extremely complex, but he gives you a complete body workout in about 63 minutes.  Those of you familiar with Yee's &quot;Power Yoga the complete workout&quot; will note that this work out goes 60+ minutes straight, versus breaking up the workout into three types (stamina, strength, and flexibility).  This workout will build endurance for sure.  I like how this DVD is a little less rushed than the first Power Yoga DVD.  The poses are held longer, and are slightly more difficult than the first DVD, but the pace is slower.  In this DVD you may feel less rushed than you did in the previous Power Yoga DVD with moving from one pose to the next.  If you are new to Yoga, this may be tough for you.  Although these poses may or may not be difficult for everyone, the sequence and the amount of time you spend doing them may be.

I'm not saying that there are not challenging poses mixed in, because there are some challenging poses such has half moon and some good back bending poses such as wheel (3xs) and camel, but the rest was average.  Rodney seems to like going from staff pose to cobbler back and forth over and over again and I'm not sure why.  Perhaps it adds some additional grounding.  For me, it disrupted the flow and was a bit annoying.On the positive, his directions are exceptional.

He has a calm way of cuing (it's done as a voice over but in a nice pleasant way) and he has used an excellent setting - Hawaii (for some reason I find this also adding to the relaxation factor).For the beginners the first half uses easier poses like downward dog and the sun salutations and the advanced people can do the more challenging section which includes moves like upward bow and a standing back bend.  The stretch at the end is fantastic and you come away feeling nice and relaxed yet like you have done a great workout.

I'm fairly new to yoga, but athletic so I have no problems getting into the poses or with flexability-and have taken yoga courses outside of these videos.The Good: Yee's delivery is spot on for what I want. Clear, solid, and calm. The workout moves between easier poses quickly, and lingers on other-more difficult poses... perfect. After this video I feel clear and calm. There is a good 10 minute warm up, 20 minutes of some balancing poses, and then about 10 minutes worth of nice hip-openers to cooldown. I like the flow of this dvd... it's got a great rhythm, easy to get into. It's very helpful that Yee uses the traditional English names for the poses (EG. triangle pose, extended-angle pose, bow pose, etc). These are the names your most likely to hear in another video or studio, so when he calls out the next pose-you know exactly what to expect.Nuetral: At times, Yee describes the poses in terms that newer practitioners won't understand. ""EXAMPLE: Form an arch from the root of your sacrum to the crown of your head"" and so forth. I understand where these parts of my body are, but that doesn't mean I can ""feel"" what he's describing mid-pose. No matter, I just discard this information and continue. At times the voice narration is behind the onscreen demonstration... only a problem if your watching the TV instead of doing the poses.The Bad: My real complaints here are that (1) the workout feels somewhat short at around 40 minutes, and (2) isn't that challenging-apart from the three upward bows in sequence. I generally use this DVD on days when I don't want the more rigorous [but stunted flowing] workouts provided by Brian Kests ""Power Yoga"" series.The Verdict: This is a solid purchase and I get a lot of use from the DVD. I really enjoy Yee's flow, instruction, and delivery. I feel very calm and refreshed after completing this routine. On the downside, the workout feels ""incomplete""... as if Yee left 20 minutes worth of poses on the cutting room floor.",4,"Yee: a good teacher, but a workout that leaves something on the table...",1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,2049,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'Brian', 'Kest', 'Power', 'Yoga', '1', '2', '3', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'new', 'yoga', 'athletic', 'so', 'have', 'problems', 'getting', 'poses', 'flexability-and', 'have', 'taken', 'yoga', 'courses', 'videos.The', 'Good', 'Yee', 'delivery', 'spot', 'what', 'want', 'Clear', 'solid', 'calm', 'workout', 'moves', 'easier', 'poses', 'quickly', 'lingers', 'other-more', 'difficult', 'poses', 'perfect', 'video', 'feel', 'clear', 'calm', 'good', '10', 'minute', 'warm', 'up', '20', 'minutes', 'balancing', 'poses', 'then', '10', 'minutes', 'nice', 'hip-openers', 'cooldown', 'flow', 'dvd', 'got', 'great', 'rhythm', 'easy', 'get', 'very', 'helpful', 'Yee', 'traditional', 'English', 'names', 'poses', 'EG', 'triangle', 'pose', 'extended-angle', 'pose', 'bow', 'pose', 'etc', 'are', 'names', 'most', 'likely', 'hear', 'video', 'studio', 'so', 'when', 'out', 'next', 'pose-you', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect.Nuetral', 'times', 'Yee', 'poses', 'terms', 'newer', 'practitioners', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'EXAMPLE', 'Form', 'arch', 'root', 'sacrum', 'crown', 'head', 'so', 'forth', 'understand', 'where', 'parts', 'body', 'are', ""n't"", 'mean', 'can', 'feel', 'what', 'describing', 'mid-pose', 'matter', 'just', 'discard', 'information', 'continue', 'times', 'voice', 'narration', 'onscreen', 'demonstration', 'only', 'problem', 'watching', 'TV', 'instead', 'doing', 'poses.The', 'Bad', 'real', 'complaints', 'here', 'are', '1', 'workout', 'somewhat', 'short', '40', 'minutes', '2', ""n't"", 'challenging-apart', 'three', 'upward', 'bows', 'sequence', 'generally', 'use', 'DVD', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'more', 'rigorous', '[', 'stunted', 'flowing', ']', 'workouts', 'provided', 'Brian', 'Kests', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'series.The', 'Verdict', 'solid', 'purchase', 'get', 'lot', 'use', 'DVD', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Yee', 'flow', 'instruction', 'delivery', 'feel', 'very', 'calm', 'refreshed', 'completing', 'routine', 'downside', 'workout', 'incomplete', 'Yee', 'left', '20', 'minutes', 'poses', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor']",N/A

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[358, 366]","My primary reasons for taking up yoga were to lose weight, reallign my back, increase flexibility, and achieve more relaxed breathing. Yee's Total Body Workout, a little over an hour, achieves all my goals. First, let me say you need to have about six months of basic yoga in order to do these moves and you probably can't be more than thirty pounds overweight; many of the moves require a body that is reasonably muscular. I've got six months of yoga and thirty years of bodybuilding (both a blessing and a curse) behind me so I can do 90% of the moves. Secondly, you should invest in a thick yoga mat; they go for about forty dollars and if you sweat a lot like I do, place a beach towel over the mat so you don't slip. The only other piece of equipment you might need is a ten-dollar strap or just a belt for some of the lying leg stretches.I like Yee's screen persona. He is authentic, direct, and clear. He spares you New Age pretentiousness, self-aggrandizement, and any other affectations.The workout is vigorous and fast-paced. For the first five minutes, a warm-up period, you think you're going to get off with an easy workout but within twenty minutes you're sopping with sweat. The first couple of times you might just have to figure out what Yee is doing. By the third workout, you should be able to follow along seamlessly. It's worth the work. You'll burn between 500-700 calories per workout; that's over a pound of fat a week or fifty-two pounds a year.On a more subtle note, I've noticed my breathing is more relaxed throughout the day and there appears to be a connection between relaxed breathing and less consumption of food. I've always been cursed with a voracious appetite, and while my daily hour of yoga hasn't totally cured it, my hungers are lower, I'd say 10% less than without the yoga.Also with bodybuilding and cardio at the gym, I come home exhausted and must nap for a good hour before I can do anything productive. With yoga, I don't need a nap. I'm already energized.It's important to change your yoga workouts so you don't go stale.

This dvd is one of his best in my opinion.This is definitely a vinyasa yoga dvd, meaning that the movements flow one into the other fluidly so no one position is ""held"". That's not to say that there aren't some sections where he holds certain stretches, but overall I found this to be much more in the vinyasa style than his other dvds. You go through a Sun Salutation sequence several times throughout the practice.I found this to be one of his more advanced dvds, aimed toward those with at least some yoga experience. Beginners could do this as well, but may need to work up to some of the movements and watch the dvd before trying it. The most difficult poses are probably a full back bend (upward bow) and some balancing poses like half moon and warrior 3. I enjoyed that this dvd got my whole body temp up as each muscle felt both strengthened and stretched through the repetition and flow of poses.If you're a fan of yoga, Rodney Yee is one of the best instructors, and this dvd is arguably my favorite of his.",5,One of Rodney Yee's best,1301961600,"04 5, 2011",2011,1259,"['am', 'fan', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'find', 'be', 'very', 'knowledgeable', 'instructor', 'style', ""n't"", 'too', 'heavily', 'focused', 'mental/spiritual', 'side', 'yoga', 'OR', 'purely', 'physical', 'side', 'rather', 'nice', 'balance', 'two', 'dvd', 'one', 'best', 'opinion.This', 'definitely', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'meaning', 'movements', 'flow', 'one', 'other', 'fluidly', 'one', 'position', 'held', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'sections', 'where', 'certain', 'stretches', 'overall', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'vinyasa', 'style', 'other', 'dvds', 'go', 'Sun', 'Salutation', 'sequence', 'several', 'times', 'practice.I', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'advanced', 'dvds', 'aimed', 'least', 'yoga', 'experience', 'Beginners', 'could', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'need', 'work', 'up', 'movements', 'watch', 'dvd', 'trying', 'most', 'difficult', 'poses', 'are', 'probably', 'full', 'back', 'bend', 'upward', 'bow', 'balancing', 'poses', 'moon', 'warrior', '3', 'enjoyed', 'dvd', 'got', 'whole', 'body', 'up', 'muscle', 'felt', 'strengthened', 'stretched', 'repetition', 'flow', 'poses.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'yoga', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'one', 'best', 'instructors', 'dvd', 'arguably', 'favorite']",N/A
756754,A3AWSYQDJ4FENK,B00009Q98A,tea,"[2, 2]","...which is exactly why I bought this DVD and I love it! I'd started off with Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners DVD and after about a month's practice with it wanted to graduate to a tougher workout. Initially I found the DVD extremely hard (on the first day I couldn't go beyond 20 minutes). As others have stated, it is not a beginner-level workout and ideally I should have picked up one of Yee's other DVDs. But this was the only 60 minute workout by Rodney Yee that I could find. Make sure you familiarize yourself with what the poses entail (for which I recommend the Beginners' DVD) before you begin.But bit by bit, with regular practice I found my strength and stamina going up. By the end of the second week I could do the entire 60 minutes, albeit with modifications. I am in my second month now and though still hard, I have started enjoying the workout.Of course, I still rely on modifications, for instance, I do the bridge pose instead of upward bow; modified camel instead of camel; when I take my leg up they're bent (not straight like Rodney's) etc. etc. But in the first month, with my thoughts along the lines of ""aaaaah I'd rather be doing the dishes""(a much despised chore), I was at a whole different level! But I digress. My point is that even if you aren't a seasoned practitioner, stick with the DVD and with time you will get stronger. Just remember to not push yourself too hard.On another note, I love the background music though it took a while to grow on me. As for the sequence - the first 30 minutes consists of mountain pose, forward bend, plank, push-up, up/down dog followed by warrior two/triangle/extended side angle/warrior one/half-moon/warrior 3. Yes, it can get repetitive but personally I enjoy the repetitive-ness! The latter half has back-bends,camel,upward bow, some seated bends and twists among others.And finally a word about the instructor - Rodney Yee is amazing. After a couple of times, I didn't even need to look at the screen as his instructions were spot-on. He doesn't really give a breakdown of the poses, but does give valuable tips that help in safe and effective execution of the poses.I just wish Gaiam and Rodney Yee would incorporate the matrix technology in their DVDs. I am now looking for an alternative for variety. All other Rodney Yee DVDs have multiple 20-minute practices which seems to be the format in demand. But they are difficult to use for a longer practice without the matrix.",5,"An hour long, repititive, tough workout...",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2452,"['exactly', 'why', 'bought', 'DVD', 'love', ""'d"", 'started', 'off', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'DVD', 'month', 'practice', 'wanted', 'graduate', 'tougher', 'workout', 'Initially', 'found', 'DVD', 'extremely', 'hard', 'first', 'day', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', '20', 'minutes', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'not', 'beginner-level', 'workout', 'ideally', 'should', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'one', 'Yee', 'other', 'DVDs', 'was', 'only', '60', 'minute', 'workout', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'could', 'find', 'Make', 'sure', 'familiarize', 'what', 'poses', 'entail', 'recommend', 'Beginners', 'DVD', 'begin.But', 'bit', 'bit', 'regular', 'practice', 'found', 'strength', 'stamina', 'going', 'up', 'end', 'second', 'week', 'could', 'do', 'entire', '60', 'minutes', 'modifications', 'am', 'second', 'month', 'now', 'still', 'hard', 'have', 'started', 'enjoying', 'workout.Of', 'course', 'still', 'rely', 'modifications', 'instance', 'do', 'bridge', 'pose', 'instead', 'upward', 'bow', 'modified', 'camel', 'instead', 'camel', 'when', 'take', 'leg', ""'re"", 'bent', 'not', 'straight', 'Rodney', 'etc', 'etc', 'first', 'month', 'thoughts', 'lines', 'aaaaah', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'doing', 'dishes', 'much', 'despised', 'chore', 'was', 'whole', 'different', 'level', 'digress', 'point', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'seasoned', 'practitioner', 'stick', 'DVD', 'time', 'will', 'get', 'stronger', 'Just', 'remember', 'not', 'push', 'too', 'note', 'love', 'background', 'music', 'took', 'while', 'grow', 'sequence', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'consists', 'mountain', 'pose', 'forward', 'bend', 'plank', 'push-up', 'up/down', 'dog', 'followed', 'warrior', 'two/triangle/extended', 'side', 'angle/warrior', 'one/half-moon/warrior', '3', 'Yes', 'can', 'get', 'repetitive', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'repetitive-ness', 'latter', 'half', 'back-bends', 'camel', 'upward', 'bow', 'seated', 'bends', 'twists', 'others.And', 'finally', 'word', 'instructor', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'amazing', 'couple', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'look', 'screen', 'instructions', 'were', 'spot-on', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'breakdown', 'poses', 'give', 'valuable', 'tips', 'help', 'safe', 'effective', 'execution', 'poses.I', 'just', 'wish', 'Gaiam', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'would', 'incorporate', 'matrix', 'technology', 'DVDs', 'am', 'now', 'looking', 'alternative', 'variety', 'other', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'DVDs', 'have', 'multiple', '20-minute', 'practices', 'be', 'format', 'demand', 'are', 'difficult', 'use', 'longer', 'practice', 'matrix']",N/A

You then seamlessly progress to a vigorous standing series that flows in and out of a variety of poses in a delightfully unexpected and surprising helpful way.  Concentration is key here if you want to tap into your deeper strength, balance and alignment.  RY then moves you to the floor for an unusual and smoothly continuous series of stretches, core strengtheners, backbends and twists (no inversions) before leading you through a much needed relaxation finish.The spectacular setting helps set your mood when you first watch the DVD to become familiar with the routine before doing it.  RY's beautifully melodic, calm and non-judgmental voice makes it easy to establish a focused and even meditative state of concentration. Once actually in the class, RY's instruction and cueing are perfect; I've done the class three times now and find I do not need to look at the screen at all (unless I want to, of course) because he leads you through everything so well.The poses themselves are not new or particularly challenging for a practiced yogi.  However, the unusual, continuous flow and tempo of the sequences demand your complete concentration if you want to do the asanas correctly.

I've lost 50 pounds, am stronger, more alert, yet calmer than before I started.  I cannot explain why, but I went from having chronic allergies to having none at all.  My dentist also claims I found a cure for gum disease.  I assume this is from the breathing.  After starting this program I searched and bought several workout DVDs to mix it up with this one. My complaints were always the same.  Either the teacher talked too much or they were incredibly slow.  I am interested in the philosophy behind Yoga but save all that for bonus features.  Don't tell me while I'm stuck in Downward Dog for five minutes.  I wanted a fairly even paced, rigorous  flow with poses that worked the whole body.  Rodney Yee created the best I have found.I've read some reviews that state this is not for beginners.  Of course a beginner like I was will not do every pose, or in my case all the poses perfectly.  I was not a flexible person but can now do every pose correctly.  I have torn cartilage in my knee so a couple of poses (the lotus series) are impossible.  The secret is to stick with it and the pose will come.  I have now modified the ending a bit to include a few poses from Astanga, inversions, and more half boat poses.  My only criticism is that Yee does not do enough work on the abs.The workout is 60 minutes and is a flowing vinyasa sequence that combines Sun Salutations with standing poses, forward bends, back bends, twists, and arm balances for a complete total-body workout.  The workout seems to drag toward the last 10 minutes so I have modified as mentioned above by adding more half boat poses and a few inversions such as shoulder stands.  I highly recommend doing this workout in the morning and have not suffered by getting up earlier to accommodate my work schedule.  I have turned many people on to Yoga as everyone has asked how I lost 50 pounds without changing my diet.  Oh yeah, I am 50 years old.  This was my answer to my mid life crisis. Definitely cheaper than buying a red Porsche.",5,The Best Yoga Workout Out There,1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,2173,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'workout', 'morning', 'last', '12', 'months', 'can', 'definitely', 'say', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Total', 'Body', 'Workout', 'best', 'there', ""'ve"", 'lost', '50', 'pounds', 'am', 'stronger', 'more', 'alert', 'yet', 'calmer', 'started', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'why', 'went', 'having', 'chronic', 'allergies', 'having', 'none', 'My', 'dentist', 'also', 'found', 'cure', 'gum', 'disease', 'assume', 'breathing', 'starting', 'program', 'searched', 'bought', 'several', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'mix', 'up', 'one', 'complaints', 'were', 'always', 'same', 'teacher', 'talked', 'too', 'much', 'were', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'am', 'interested', 'philosophy', 'Yoga', 'save', 'bonus', 'features', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'m"", 'stuck', 'Downward', 'Dog', 'five', 'minutes', 'wanted', 'fairly', 'even', 'paced', 'rigorous', 'flow', 'poses', 'worked', 'whole', 'body', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'created', 'best', 'have', 'found.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'state', 'not', 'beginners', 'course', 'beginner', 'was', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'pose', 'case', 'poses', 'perfectly', 'was', 'not', 'flexible', 'person', 'can', 'now', 'do', 'pose', 'correctly', 'have', 'torn', 'cartilage', 'knee', 'couple', 'poses', 'lotus', 'series', 'are', 'impossible', 'secret', 'stick', 'pose', 'will', 'come', 'have', 'now', 'modified', 'ending', 'bit', 'include', 'few', 'poses', 'Astanga', 'inversions', 'more', 'half', 'boat', 'poses', 'only', 'criticism', 'Yee', 'not', 'do', 'enough', 'work', 'abs.The', 'workout', '60', 'minutes', 'flowing', 'vinyasa', 'sequence', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'standing', 'poses', 'forward', 'back', 'twists', 'arm', 'balances', 'complete', 'total-body', 'workout', 'workout', 'drag', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'have', 'modified', 'mentioned', 'adding', 'more', 'half', 'boat', 'poses', 'few', 'inversions', 'such', 'shoulder', 'highly', 'recommend', 'doing', 'workout', 'morning', 'have', 'not', 'suffered', 'getting', 'up', 'earlier', 'accommodate', 'work', 'schedule', 'have', 'turned', 'many', 'people', 'Yoga', 'everyone', 'asked', 'how', 'lost', '50', 'pounds', 'changing', 'diet', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'am', '50', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'answer', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'Definitely', 'cheaper', 'buying', 'red', 'Porsche']",N/A

This is a well-made DVD and challenging workout for a beginner. I found the positions challenging without being too tiring or difficult to do until after about half an hour. Rodney Yee progresses from easier poses to increasingly difficult ones, and I have to stop at about 30 minutes because I haven't developed the strength to do the poses after that mark. Even though I have to cut it short, I still find that I get a really good workout, and I've found that I'm much more toned overall after I started using this DVD and alternating it with my cardio workouts.I highly recommend this for beginners and those looking for overall toning without creating bulkiness.",5,"Good instruction, lovely background",1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,806,"['third', 'fourth', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'bought', 'decided', 'try', 'out', 'yoga', 'workout', 'instead', 'running', 'back', 'injury', 'well-made', 'DVD', 'challenging', 'workout', 'beginner', 'found', 'positions', 'challenging', 'being', 'too', 'tiring', 'difficult', 'do', 'hour', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'easier', 'poses', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'ones', 'have', 'stop', 'about', '30', 'minutes', 'have', ""n't"", 'developed', 'strength', 'do', 'poses', 'mark', 'Even', 'have', 'cut', 'short', 'still', 'find', 'get', 'really', 'good', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'found', ""'m"", 'much', 'more', 'toned', 'overall', 'started', 'using', 'DVD', 'alternating', 'cardio', 'workouts.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'looking', 'overall', 'toning', 'creating', 'bulkiness']",N/A

I only gave it 4 stars because on the back of the video box it mentions arm balances.  There are no arm balances on the video version.  Maybe on the DVD version.  One of the 1st reviewers said that there is a crane pose? Not on the video version.  I was disappointed and annoyed that the video description was incorrect on this matter.  Also on Collagevideo, the review said something about a standing back bend.  Very misleading.  Those of us who take yoga classes thought that meant dropping into upward facing bow from a standing position.  No so.  It just means that you stretch back after finishing a sun saluation. Other than that, the poses are not difficult for any adv. beg./intermediate practitioner.  The best part of the class is going back and forth between staff pose and plow pose.  How wonderful that is for your back! Also, with bow pose you hold your feet from the inside instead of the outside, this appears to give a wonderful stretch to the shoulders.  There are no inversions, arm balances or really challenging poses.  All in all it is good for those of us long time yogis who are short on time, but want to get the kinks out. Looking forward to anything else Rodney does.  He NEVER bombards you with useless chatter like Baron Baptiste or Bryan Kest--NO &quot;repor with the floor&quot; nonsense; just very useful instructions.

756762,A3IB6BLXU304PF,B00009Q98A,Zenful,"[12, 18]","Yes this is Rodney and he is lovely and the workout is adequate but I found that, compared to other Gaiam Dvds (of which I own 10 or so) the ""cinematography"" of this one was quite bland.  I had purchased it having read the reviews here, and did the routine for the first time last night.  Although it is a GOOD and CHALLENGING workout (and indeed much lengthier than others on the market) I just was not inspired and truthfully, got a bit bored.There are so many videos on the market and the one thing I LOVE about the Gaiam series is always the lovely scenery and beautiful music. Let's be honest, that is why we all love the Gaiam series!  I think this one was a rush job because neither were very good. Rodney is on top of a hill the entire time and the music is more elevator than relaxation. As for the workout yes it was decent and thorough (you start with sun salutations and finish with upward arrow in a slow repetitive progression increasing in difficutly), although I found it a bit monotonous through the one single routine and repetitive music which is about 1 hour in length.  Also agree with R Smith comment posted here- the narration is also a bit loud and not as soothing as other Rodney videos.  Basically, something is just a bit off about the presentation of this series.I enjoyed the Rodney Yee Yoga for Strength and Flexi DVD much better and would recommend that one over this one for any one who has trouble ""self motivating"" and finds the music and scenery an added benefit to the workout regiment.  If that is NOT important to you, however, then I would encourage you to add this to your collection as it would actually be a good DVD to take on holiday with you or when travelling if you need 1 DVD that will give you a good solid hour long workout.  You should be at the intermediate level to complete the entire workout.Namastei.",3,"Okay, but disappointing for Gaiam",1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,1856,"['Yes', 'Rodney', 'lovely', 'workout', 'adequate', 'found', 'compared', 'other', 'Gaiam', 'Dvds', 'own', '10', 'so', 'cinematography', 'one', 'was', 'quite', 'bland', 'had', 'purchased', 'having', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'did', 'routine', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'GOOD', 'CHALLENGING', 'workout', 'indeed', 'much', 'lengthier', 'others', 'market', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'inspired', 'truthfully', 'got', 'bit', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'videos', 'market', 'one', 'thing', 'LOVE', 'Gaiam', 'series', 'always', 'lovely', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'why', 'love', 'Gaiam', 'series', 'think', 'one', 'was', 'rush', 'job', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'Rodney', 'top', 'hill', 'entire', 'time', 'music', 'more', 'elevator', 'relaxation', 'workout', 'yes', 'was', 'decent', 'thorough', 'start', 'sun', 'salutations', 'finish', 'upward', 'arrow', 'slow', 'repetitive', 'progression', 'increasing', 'difficutly', 'found', 'bit', 'monotonous', 'one', 'single', 'routine', 'repetitive', 'music', '1', 'hour', 'length', 'Also', 'agree', 'R', 'Smith', 'comment', 'posted', 'narration', 'also', 'bit', 'loud', 'not', 'as', 'soothing', 'other', 'Rodney', 'videos', 'Basically', 'something', 'just', 'bit', 'presentation', 'series.I', 'enjoyed', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Yoga', 'Strength', 'Flexi', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'one', 'one', 'who', 'trouble', 'self', 'motivating', 'music', 'scenery', 'added', 'benefit', 'workout', 'regiment', 'NOT', 'important', 'however', 'then', 'would', 'encourage', 'add', 'collection', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'good', 'DVD', 'take', 'holiday', 'when', 'travelling', 'need', '1', 'DVD', 'will', 'give', 'good', 'solid', 'hour', 'long', 'workout', 'should', 'be', 'intermediate', 'level', 'complete', 'entire', 'workout.Namastei']",N/A
