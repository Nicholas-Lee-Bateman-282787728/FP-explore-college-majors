There are no famous actors or actresses in it, although Eleanor Bron, who plays the evil headmistress Miss Minchin, looks familiar. This is a beautifully produced adaptation of the original book, which I remember rather better than many others in this cycle of books made into movies. And like the Shirley Temple version, it ends with Sara reunited with the father who was presumed dead in World War I. In the book, as I recall, the kindly old man next door, or rather his son, adopts Sara. But in modern times, unfortunately, this would be taken as too suggestive of child abuse or at least exploitation.So it goes. Literature suffers for the sins of man.Anyway, the stories of India which Sara tells to the other girls are illustrated by the movie, including a ""Prince Rama"" who has blue skin. So we are to imply that he is not merely magical, but a god. Sara, of course, knows little of such details. She is relating the stories her nurse told her in India and embellishing them with her fertile imagination.It's a story celebrating imagination, but at one point poor Becky says, ""This time I think you have gone too far."" When you see the movie, you may be inclined to agree with Becky, although nominally there is a material-world explanation for what clearly seems to be some very powerful conjure magic.You should see it, and share it with your kids and grandkids.

The acting is good, the costumes and set believable and the interweaving of Hindu mythology that parallels the plot of the movie is nicely done. The one thing I did not like was the portrayal of Indians in the film, but this is also a fault of the book. They fell into the old stereotypes of Indians and India as exotic, mysterious, and mystical. The Indian servant of Mr. Randolph, though central to the plot, reminded me so much of portrayals of black servants and slaves in earlier movies, as servile, loyal, always smiling, wise beyond their station and years, and mysterious. Yet, I liked the racial reconcilliation portrayed in the friendship between Sarah and Becky and like how Becky is adopted by Sarah's father at the end.

In the history of film, a handful of pictures stand out for the jaw-dropping, revolutionary power of the vision that their directors brought to the screen.  Think of ""Napoleon"", ""The Scarlet Empress"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Breathless"", ""2001"".  Alfonso Cuaron brings the same intensity to bear in his production of ""A Little Princess"", creating a masterpiece whose stampeding procession of set pieces knocks the viewer to the floor .  Awash in blazing light, burnished golds, and vernal greens, the film's mystical India and menacingly enchanted New York create an intoxicating atmosphere for the Blakean story of a little girl horribly lost in an unforgiving world once she is bereft of her beloved father.  Young Sara's gifts for imagination and compassion war against Miss Minchon's brutish system of materialism and grinding practicality in a story that is accessible to children but offers higher truths for the adult.  The screenplay, awash in references to the ""Ramayana"" and with hints of pantheistic intuition, compliments the Shelleyan Romanticism of the visuals.  Cuaron and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki achieve a kind of pictorial radiance matched only by the Bertolucci of ""Little Buddha"" and ""Beseiged"".  The incisive editing, the soaring cranes, create an exhilarating sense of wonder:  the unbelievable audacity of the scene in which Sara consoles a little girl hurls us over any objection to the sentimentality  by sheer creative authority-- the swooning poetry of the images and words forces our belief.  Long before the famous Snow Scene, the viewer is wheeling over with  intoxication at the beauty of this film.

None of us read the book so I'm not sure what is driven by the book and what is the movie's merit or fault. The child actors are well chosen.

The scenes in India are particularly gorgeous. The acting is, by and large, superb.

As the 1939 Shirley Temple  version, this &quot;LP&quot; simply appropriates the characters' names and  the vague situation. Most of the action in the second half of the  film--including the discovery of the attic room, the ashes incident, the  wild chase and the ending--are from the Temple picture, not the  book.Similarly, the characters deviate significantly from those  described in the book. Liesel Matthews is excellent, but she does not have  the personality of Burnett's Sara Crewe.

87712,A11ZCZ874OORU0,0790725657,"EJ ""EJ""","[10, 14]","The book is my very favorite ever. It touched me deeply as a child, and even as an adult I dust off my old hardcover and reread it every few years. The movie was a profound disappointment--a cotton candy-like ball of Hollywood fluff more worthy of the Olsen sisters than an adaptation of one of the best novels ever written.Many details of the story were changed, an overhaul I would endorse if the new stuff were compelling. I personally do not feel movies need to slavishly follow books, as a great director can bring a fresh eye to a classic story, making it his own. But here, every addition or change was pointless and served only to diminish the power of the story. As just one example, in the original story--where hunger was a major theme--Sara gives a starving illiterate scullery maid a meat pie to eat. In this movie, it seems to be about lack of luxury footwear: Sarah gives the servant a pair of Mae West style fur-trimmed slippers with a note that says, ""Let's be friends.""But it's not the minor details that result in this movie becoming a tragic dumbing down of a great classic, it's the big ones. The main message of the movie is a jawdroppingly meaningless platitude:""every girl is a princess."" The original, by contrast, was about one exceptional girl whose beautiful soul and empathy for others continued even as she was transformed overnight from a rich, pampered elite boarder to a pauper. In the book, her self-control and nobility of spirit made her a princess, no matter her circumstances. Lesson to little girls: It's what's inside that matters.For those who love the book, I highly recommend the BBC version starring Amelia Shankley. This beautiful, realistic and haunting version brought tears to my eyes. I watched it for the first time last night on YouTube simply because I had to cleanse myself from the insipid Cuar&oacute;n version. I recommend that anyone reading this skip the intermediate step and pass right to the BBC version, which is also available through Amazon on DVD:A Little Princess.",1,Tragic Dumbing Down of A Great Classic,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,2030,"['book', 'very', 'favorite', 'ever', 'touched', 'deeply', 'child', 'even', 'adult', 'dust', 'off', 'old', 'hardcover', 'reread', 'few', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'profound', 'disappointment', 'cotton', 'candy-like', 'ball', 'Hollywood', 'fluff', 'more', 'worthy', 'Olsen', 'sisters', 'adaptation', 'one', 'best', 'novels', 'ever', 'written.Many', 'details', 'story', 'were', 'changed', 'overhaul', 'would', 'endorse', 'new', 'stuff', 'were', 'compelling', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'movies', 'need', 'slavishly', 'follow', 'books', 'great', 'director', 'can', 'bring', 'fresh', 'eye', 'classic', 'story', 'making', 'own', 'here', 'addition', 'change', 'was', 'pointless', 'served', 'only', 'diminish', 'power', 'story', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'original', 'story', 'where', 'hunger', 'was', 'major', 'theme', 'Sara', 'starving', 'illiterate', 'scullery', 'maid', 'meat', 'pie', 'eat', 'movie', 'be', 'lack', 'luxury', 'footwear', 'Sarah', 'servant', 'pair', 'Mae', 'West', 'style', 'fur-trimmed', 'slippers', 'note', 'Let', 'be', 'friends', 'not', 'minor', 'details', 'result', 'movie', 'becoming', 'tragic', 'dumbing', 'great', 'classic', 'big', 'ones', 'main', 'message', 'movie', 'jawdroppingly', 'meaningless', 'platitude', 'girl', 'princess', 'original', 'contrast', 'was', 'one', 'exceptional', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'soul', 'empathy', 'others', 'continued', 'even', 'was', 'transformed', 'overnight', 'rich', 'pampered', 'elite', 'boarder', 'pauper', 'book', 'self-control', 'nobility', 'spirit', 'made', 'princess', 'matter', 'circumstances', 'Lesson', 'little', 'girls', 'what', 'inside', 'matters.For', 'who', 'love', 'book', 'highly', 'recommend', 'BBC', 'version', 'starring', 'Amelia', 'Shankley', 'beautiful', 'realistic', 'haunting', 'version', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'YouTube', 'simply', 'had', 'cleanse', 'insipid', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'version', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'reading', 'intermediate', 'step', 'pass', 'right', 'BBC', 'version', 'also', 'available', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'Little', 'Princess']",A Little Princess VHS

When her father is killed in battle and there's no one to pay for Sarah's school fees, the cruel headmistress forces Sarah into a life of poverty. She quickly befriends the other servant girl whose name is Becky, and somehow manages to live through the hardships that come her way. The ending just blew me away.

Sara develops a close bond with Becky, who is also a servant at the school. Throughout the movie, Sara's strength and her kind nature will enchant everyone who watches the film.

The riches-to-rags-to-riches story is one of the author's best. This Warner Bros. production is very Americanized but it's tons of fun and visually pleasing.Sara Crewe is moved from exotic India, where she makes up fantasy stories based her Ayah's retelling of Indian mythology, to New York for boarding school. Headmistress Miss Minchin (played excellently by Eleanor Bron) is a sort of Cruella de Ville. The school building itself is sort of fantastical (reminds me of Harry Potter a bit) and there is a very ""Annie""  vibe to the whole thing, only it's a boarding school, not an orphanage. I expected the film to break out into a song and dance segment at any moment.The premise here is not that Sara is a princess in rags but ""every little girl is a princess."" This will resonate with the current princess craze for little girls.  Personally, I don't hold with ""every girl is a princess"" because you just end up with a Bridezilla someday but that is another discussion. Meanwhile, Sara does her princessly best under duress as a household drudge, paying back her father's debts to Miss Minchin; and all along there are hijinks with the other pupils and Miss Minchin's fat and silly sister. Miss Amelia has a far better role in this film than in the book. She's a welcome comic relief.If you expect a novelization as faithful to the book as the Harry Potter films are faithful, you will be disappointed.

87738,A24ZYSYICMEGSD,0790725657,Jody Mosier,"[4, 4]","I liked this film alot. The scenery and costumes were beautiful, and the acting was brilliant. I especially enjoyed the presence of Ermengarde and Lottie, two wonderful characters from the book who were not in the previous Shirely Temple version. However, I've noticed that the filmmakers borrowed some scenes from Shirley's film, especially toward the end. The climax of the film is very similar to Shirley's: The Indian servant sneaks into their room at night, decorates it all up nicely, and then later Miss Minchin comes in and blames the girls for stealing the stuff. She locks them in their rooms and calls the police. The girls attempt escape by going out on the ledge and into the window of the house next door. Sara makes it but Becky gets caught. Sara hides in the house (in the ST version she manages to get to the hospital) and, while still on the run, happens to find her father, who doesn't remember her. Just as she's about to be caught by the police, her father remembers her and comes to her rescue -- and all is happily ever after.The original story ends differently. In the book, the Indian servant comes back night after night with new additions and good food, and the girls' newly decorated attic room is never discovered by anyone else. The old man who lives next door is actually a very kindhearted gentleman, as opposed to the bitter, cold man in the film who hardly gives Sara a second glance. He secretly sends Sara some fine, new clothing and Miss Minchin, who believes Sara has some wealthy, distant relative, allows her to wear them and begins treating her more decently, even allowing her to resume her lessons in the classroom. One night, the Indian servant's monkey escapes into Sara's room. She goes over to the house next door to return it, and starts a conversation with the old man. Upon telling him her name, she finds that he is a friend of her father's who has been looking for her for two years. Although Sara's father really does die in the book, the ending is still very happy. While I enjoyed this film, I think the directors should have stuck closer to the original story than the previous film version.

The school is run by the hard-nosed Miss Minchin (expertly played by Eleanor Bron), who, upon learning that Sarah's father is presumed dead, turns Sarah into an impoverished servant. Like most of Burnett's great stories, this one pits one optimistic, winning child against the overwhelming odds of a harsh world. Sarah's ability to bring joy to the other girls she meets builds her a powerful support network, and in the end her triumph is tremendously moving.

Even if they aren't pretty, or young, or smart, they're still princesses. All of us! Didn't your father ever tell you that? Didn't he?&quot;Well no. My Dad didn't call me a princess, and that's because I'm a guy. But after seeing this movie, I was really beginning to wish I was. &quot;A Little Princess&quot; is quite simply amazing. It is the most magical family movie there is. I just can't recommend it high enough. I saw this at the movie theater, 7 times and it is quite easily my favorite film of all time.Set in 1914, &quot;A Little Princess&quot; tells the story of a girl called Sara who goes to a strict boarding school while her father from England goes to fight the War. The school is run by a mean spirited head teacher called Miss Minchin. From the start, Miss Minchin is jealous of Sara who considers herself to be a princess. After all, her Papa has told her that she will always be his little princess. Despite the harshness of Miss Minchin, Sara continues to fill those around her with magic as she tells stories to them of a beautiful princess and her prince.The emotion begins early in this movie, firstly being when Sara and her Papa say goodbye as he goes into war. Midway through the movie Sara hears that her Papa has been killed in battle. I have to say, when I watched this I was gone. Ok I wasn't gone yet, but I was holding the tears in. Actress Liesel Matthews who plays Sara is so genuine, and director Alfonso Cuaron definitely brings out the best in her. It is at the end which is complimented by the music of Patrick Doyle, that I really did feel a few tears going by my face. It happened just after Sara realized she may truly have lost her father forever.The DVD itself just has a trailer and it would be great if it had more extras, but the moie is just so wonderful that you have to buy this DVD. In addition, the subtle Dolby Digital 5.1 is just right for a movie such as this.&quot;A Little Princess&quot; made my heart feel so much, and I really felt like a girl, getting upset over a family movie like this.

If you have read the book, then you will know what happens in the movie.The movie gives a bit of a modern twist to the book. The book was set earlier on (late 19th century), but this film is set a decade or two later, near the beginning of the 20th century. This doesn't make much of a difference, though. There's some great scenes in the movie, such as Sara being introduced to her French teacher and she shows some dismay since she already knows French. Ms. Minich reprimands her and tells her to apologize to the French teacher, and she does so - in perfect French. The teacher then proceeds to tell Ms. Minich that she could learn a thing or two from young Sara. Of course, being the bitter woman Ms. Minich is, she does not take too kindly to being shown up by her new student, even though Sara had no malicious intentions and did not mean to embarrass her teacher. Of course, when Sarah loses her father (and money) Ms. Minich does not hesitate to take her petty 'vengeance' on the poor girl.Overall it's a great film, and if you loved the book, you should love this movie, since it remained true to the book despite the changes here and there.",5,Worthy film adaptation,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,1365,"['movie', 'not', 'exactly', 'book', 'what', 'important', 'book', 'presented', 'way', 'faithful', 'what', 'book', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'what', 'intended', 'teach', 'who', 'read', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'bit', 'modern', 'twist', 'book', 'book', 'was', 'set', 'earlier', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'film', 'set', 'decade', 'two', 'later', 'beginning', '20th', 'century', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'though', 'great', 'scenes', 'movie', 'such', 'Sara', 'being', 'introduced', 'French', 'teacher', 'dismay', 'already', 'French', 'Ms.', 'Minich', 'apologize', 'French', 'teacher', 'so', 'perfect', 'French', 'teacher', 'then', 'tell', 'Ms.', 'Minich', 'could', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'young', 'Sara', 'course', 'being', 'bitter', 'woman', 'Ms.', 'Minich', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'kindly', 'being', 'shown', 'up', 'new', 'student', 'even', 'Sara', 'had', 'malicious', 'intentions', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'embarrass', 'teacher', 'course', 'when', 'Sarah', 'father', 'money', 'Ms.', 'Minich', 'not', 'hesitate', 'take', 'petty', ""'vengeance"", 'poor', 'girl.Overall', 'great', 'film', 'loved', 'book', 'should', 'love', 'movie', 'remained', 'true', 'book', 'changes', 'here', 'there']",A Little Princess VHS

They seem to have forgotten that he is responsible for this beautiful retelling of a classic children's book.This movie is based more on the classic Shirley Temple version than it is on the book, which means that it takes some creative liberties.  Gone are the diamond mines (the best part!) and back comes the father.  I did not really like these changes.  The movie is also transfered from London to New York, so it's a little unclear what they were doing in India.Despite those qualms, though, this is a brilliantly filmed fable.  The girls are wonderful: dorky Ermegard, prissy Lavinia, spoiled Lottie, and Sarah pulls off the admirable feat of not being completely insipid (if you think that this is an insult, then you haven't read the book).It is good for all ages.

87769,A3N3U3AVEDH462,0790725657,Mei L. Po,"[27, 39]","I had such high hopes for this film when I heard that it was being 'defended' against major changes (such as the introduction of a love interest). Alas, instead it merely underlined what ""Little Women"" had already shown me: be wary of movies based on books you love. -A few of the changes made- the transposition of the setting from England to America, the recasting of Becky the scullery maid as a Black slave girl- were merely interesting differences; but the damage done to character and story by other 'revisions' was enormous.This movie took one of my very favorite characters and destroyed her. The whimsical, Hans Christian Anderson-type fairy tales which she tells in the book are changed, in the movie, to stories that are darker, brooding, and rather scary, styled after Hindu myths. All the imaginative ideas which, in the book, she comes up with herself, are spoon-fed to her by her father in the movie. Sara Crewe of the book is a heroine's heroine; the girl portrayed in the movie is obnoxious, bratty and rude; plus, they changed the entire story by changing the ending. Lastly (and, for me, worst) the movie completely redefines the whole meaning of being a princess: in the book it's what gives Sara the strength to continue being kind, courteous, loyal, caring, and generous to others, even when those others are nasty to her. In the movie, we are told, EVERY girl is a princess- no matter how much like a common street beggar she behaves.--fyi a far better film adaptation was made by Wonderworks, starring Amelia Shankley; unfortunately it is out of print and extremely difficult to find.",1,READ THE BOOK INSTEAD,993600000,"06 27, 2001",2001,1608,"['had', 'such', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'being', ""'defended"", 'major', 'changes', 'such', 'introduction', 'love', 'interest', 'Alas', 'instead', 'merely', 'underlined', 'what', 'Little', 'Women', 'had', 'already', 'shown', 'be', 'wary', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'love', '-A', 'few', 'changes', 'made-', 'transposition', 'setting', 'England', 'America', 'recasting', 'Becky', 'scullery', 'maid', 'Black', 'slave', 'girl-', 'were', 'merely', 'interesting', 'differences', 'damage', 'done', 'character', 'story', 'other', ""'revisions"", 'was', 'enormous.This', 'movie', 'took', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'characters', 'destroyed', 'whimsical', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Anderson-type', 'fairy', 'tales', 'book', 'are', 'changed', 'movie', 'stories', 'are', 'darker', 'brooding', 'rather', 'scary', 'styled', 'Hindu', 'myths', 'imaginative', 'ideas', 'book', 'up', 'are', 'spoon-fed', 'father', 'movie', 'Sara', 'Crewe', 'book', 'heroine', 'heroine', 'girl', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'obnoxious', 'bratty', 'rude', 'changed', 'entire', 'story', 'changing', 'ending', 'Lastly', 'worst', 'movie', 'completely', 'whole', 'meaning', 'being', 'princess', 'book', 'what', 'Sara', 'strength', 'continue', 'being', 'kind', 'courteous', 'loyal', 'caring', 'generous', 'others', 'even', 'when', 'others', 'are', 'nasty', 'movie', 'are', 'told', 'EVERY', 'girl', 'princess-', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'common', 'street', 'fyi', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'adaptation', 'was', 'made', 'Wonderworks', 'starring', 'Amelia', 'Shankley', 'unfortunately', 'print', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'find']",A Little Princess VHS
87770,A2R37EWT0FX9O8,0790725657,MichaelJohn,"[0, 0]","I saw this movie on TV maybe a year or two after it came out in 1995. I remember enjoying it back then but I had since forgotten much about it. Thankfully, it's now available on DVD from Warner Brothers and it should be your very next movie purchase.If you haven't seen this movie yet order this DVD asap and when you watch it take the phone off the hook to make sure there are no interruptions, then gather the whole family around the TV and enjoy a truly family movie masterpiece. However, this is not a kids movie, there are many mature themes presented, in a gentle way though. And there is a scary monster briefly in a fantasy scene. Probably best for kids 8+ (but others will have different opinions on this).At the end of the movie mom will be crying but this is no cause for alarm- these will be very happy tears. Don't be surprised if Dad is holding back tears too.The credits at the beginning have the style of being for a children's movie. I was wondering if this was for children only. Then, the opening scene looks like something from a stage play and I thought if this is the way the whole movie looks I wasted my money. But that first scene was a fantasy scene (as you realize later). What happens next is the movie itself starts and within moments stunning beautiful cinematography of a river or lake in India with a huge Buddha head in the water and two children sitting happily on top of it! When a stunning scene like this is early in a film, you know you're watching something special.In brief, the movie is set in 1914 and little girl, Sarah, is sent to a boarding school in New York, New York (after spending all her life in India) when her father must fight for Britain in the First World War. The girl is played by the beautiful and radiant newcomer Liesel Matthews. DVD notes say that thousands of girls were auditioned for the part of Sarah.The whole movie is told from Sarah's point of view and there are very few movies that have true cinematic magic, but this one does. For example, the scene where she parts with her father is one of the most tender and touching moments I've ever seen in all cinema. Several other scenes are spell-bindingly magical too.Sarah becomes friends with most of the other 20 or so girls in the boarding home and soon teaches them how to awaken their sense of imagination, tells them wondrous stories of mythical India, and that ""all little girls are princesses"". However, the wicked and stern headmistress, played to perfection by Eleanor Bron, will have none of this imagination stuff from the girls. In fact, they can't even talk during dinner!As scenes unfold, so does the cinematic magic. The music score is also wonderful and is brilliantly effective in the movie climax- which I now consider one of the greatest moments in all movies.The cast is perfect. Several of the girls seen in the movie went on to other movies and TV shows. Although they are seen very briefly, take a close look and you'll see:-Camilla Belle (only 9 years old here). She appeared in Jurassic Park: The Lost World and you've seen her in other movies and TV shows too.  Too bad she's only seen very breifly in this movie.- Kaitlin Cullum (9 years old here too). She played the part of Elizabeth in TV show Grace under Fire (1993) and was Katelyn in Galaxy Quest movie. She was also played the part of Eve Plumb/Jan Brady in TV movie ""Growing Up Brady"" (2000). She also won Best Young Actress Under 10 in the Television 1994-1995 17th Young Artists Awards.-Heather DeLoach (as Ermingarde) is the ""Bee Girl"" from the Blind Melon music videoThe DVD is double sided- TV format on one side, wide-screen on the other. You get three theatrical trailers- the one for this movie and two from Secret Garden (1993 and the black & white trailer from the 1949 movie). You also get production notes and brief bios with still pics.The best movie of 1995. Best cinematography as well. It didn't win these awards in 1995 but it should have.

Liam Cunnigham is so handsome and gentle as her father, who adores his only and motherless child the way all children want to be loved. And the ""curse"" put on the snobby Lavinia is priceless!!! They could not have chosen a better child actress to play Sara. Liesel Matthews embodies her character so well that you forget that she's acting. The fantasy sequences are glorious to look at, and the little girls at the school are adorable in their uniforms. Eleanor Bron is superb as Ms. Minchen. You just love to hate her.

The DVD package is simple, no booklet, no disc graphic, but I wasn't expecting to be blown away with a bunch of extras, although a couple of extras would have been nice.  The disc comes in widescreen and full screen versions, as well as 3 trailers.  So, I put the disc into my machine and enjoyed this beautiful film.  The sound was remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1, and although this is not your shoot-em-up, explosive film that really takes advantage of 5.1, this film uses its surround elements quite nicely.  Sometimes the vocals sound a little too tinny (too much treble), but overal the stereo separation and ambiance is soothing and pleasant.  Picture quality is beautiful, with very rich color saturation and fine detail throughout the disc.  This really is a beautiful looking film, and the DVD format  unlocks the beautiful colors quite impressively.  I recommend this film for those who appreciate beautiful cinematography, and for those in the mood for a non-violent family picture.

I identify with Sara so much, from spending time in India as a child to having a close relationship with my father.This movie is based off the 1905 British novel of the same name but that's all the two have in common.  I haven't read the book but I know enough to know the movie stands on its own.  The story begins in 1914, the beginning of WWI in British India.  Sara Crewe, the daughter of the wealthy Captain Crewe live there until the war begins and Sara's father enrolls her in the prestigious academy her late mother attended in NYC.  The school is headed by the evil Miss Minchin who is clearly jealous of Sara's relationship with her father.  Sara quickly becomes the most popular student and even makes friends with Becky, the servant girl.  Sara brings joy to everyone she comes across with her imagination and belief that all girls are princesses instilled by her father.  Sara's optimism is tested when she learns her father is killed in battle and the British government controls his assets, leaving Sara penniless and forced to become a servant.The symbolism and imagery is amazing in this movie.  I love how Sara's telling of the ancient story of the divine Hindu couple Rama and Sita is juxtaposed with the fate of Sara's father and the development of the story.This movie is a children's movie but people of all ages will love it.

There have been several film versions of this movie made but so far the best one that I have seen is the BBC version. The Warner Bros. version is notable for its dramatization of Sara's stories which are very stylized and lavish and focus on the folktales of Krishna, Vishnu and the like. That is the one aspect of this movie which makes it special besides a brief scene of Sara's childhood in India. However, I felt that changing the nationality of Sara, the oversimplification of Miss Minchin as a classic Hollywood bad guy with no redeeming qualities, and the pathetic slapstick romance of her sister Amelia detracted greatly from the overall story.Most importantly of all, the focus of this movie on the supposition that ""All girls are really princesses."" undermined what I have always felt was this story's greatest strength. Sara treated everyone as equals and rose above her difficulties because of her belief in herself. She voiced this belief in terms  of being a princess but the basis was really that if someone is special and has advantages then they have a responsibility to those around them to treat them fairly and to share those advantages whenever possible. Someone who is truly special does not need to belittle others and can trust themselves to handle whatever life may give them. Saying that ""All girls are really princesses."" is something which, in my opinion, hands worth to people on the basis of merely being female and thus removes the necessary value of the need to earn that privilege. It is a syrupy sentiment that says that females are special because they are female, a supposition which has been a part of the whole ""project self-esteem"" debacle and its feminist counterpart. A more useful idea, I believe, is that all people are capable of being special and have special qualities within them which, if they develop them and work to make the best use of them, will naturally help them to create the person they want to be. I think that the BBC version of this movie handles that aspect of the story much better than this one does.",3,BBC did it better.,1050364800,"04 15, 2003",2003,2226,"['classic', 'children', 'book', 'definitely', 'more', 'appealing', 'girls', 'are', 'focus', 'story', 'worthwhile', 'message', 'anyone', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'film', 'versions', 'movie', 'made', 'so', 'far', 'best', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'BBC', 'version', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'version', 'notable', 'dramatization', 'Sara', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'stylized', 'lavish', 'focus', 'folktales', 'Krishna', 'Vishnu', 'like', 'one', 'aspect', 'movie', 'special', 'brief', 'scene', 'Sara', 'childhood', 'India', 'However', 'felt', 'changing', 'nationality', 'Sara', 'oversimplification', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'bad', 'guy', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'pathetic', 'slapstick', 'romance', 'sister', 'Amelia', 'detracted', 'greatly', 'overall', 'story.Most', 'importantly', 'focus', 'movie', 'supposition', 'girls', 'are', 'really', 'princesses', 'undermined', 'what', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'story', 'greatest', 'strength', 'Sara', 'treated', 'everyone', 'equals', 'rose', 'difficulties', 'belief', 'herself', 'voiced', 'belief', 'terms', 'being', 'princess', 'basis', 'was', 'really', 'someone', 'special', 'advantages', 'then', 'have', 'responsibility', 'treat', 'fairly', 'share', 'advantages', 'whenever', 'possible', 'Someone', 'who', 'truly', 'special', 'not', 'need', 'belittle', 'others', 'can', 'trust', 'handle', 'life', 'may', 'give', 'Saying', 'girls', 'are', 'really', 'princesses', 'something', 'opinion', 'worth', 'people', 'basis', 'merely', 'being', 'female', 'thus', 'necessary', 'value', 'need', 'earn', 'privilege', 'syrupy', 'sentiment', 'females', 'are', 'special', 'are', 'female', 'supposition', 'been', 'part', 'whole', 'project', 'self-esteem', 'debacle', 'feminist', 'counterpart', 'more', 'useful', 'idea', 'believe', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'being', 'special', 'have', 'special', 'qualities', 'develop', 'work', 'make', 'best', 'use', 'will', 'naturally', 'help', 'create', 'person', 'want', 'be', 'think', 'BBC', 'version', 'movie', 'aspect', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'one']",A Little Princess VHS

87794,A4FX5YCJA630V,0790725657,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[3, 3]","Warner Brothers' &quot;A Little Princess&quot; followed the critical success of their previous adaptation of Frances Hodgeson Burnett's classic story &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, which despite being one of the best children's movies recently created had a reasonably quiet (though by no means unsuccessful) run at the box-office. Sadly it seemed that children needed explosions and action and strobe lights and goodness knows what else in order to justify their time at the movies. But this didn't stop Warner Brothers' from creating &quot;A Little Princess&quot; and I for one am glad they did. Wonderful casting, beautiful visuals and a tearful ending make this a family classic.Sara Crewe is the daughter of an adoring father; Captain Crewe, a high-ranking army officer stationed in exotic India. Raised under the belief that she and every other woman in the world is naturally a princess, she knows of no hardships in her life. But the year is 1914, and war is on the horizon. With her father called away to fight, Sara is taken to a New York boarding school for girls under the control of the stately Miss Minchin. It is with this matriarch that Sara goes head-to-head with, as their philosophies on life are so utterly opposite. Harbouring resentment and jealously toward the little princess, it is as much cruelty as it is kindess when Miss Minchin employs Sara as a servant girl after news of her father's death.Suddenly Sara has gone from the girl who has everything to the girl who has nothing. Her faith in magic and storytelling shattered, she refuses to acknowledge the good she has already done in befriending several classmates, and it is up to the very real presence of magic in her life to intervene: watch how one &quot;coincidental&quot; gust of wind blows her shawl into the feet of someone who can change her fortunes once more, setting off a chain reaction that just might lead her once more to her father...Liesel Matthews begins her debut as Sara Crewe, and creates her wonderfully - youthful innocence and wisdom beyond her years combine to create this wonderful character who brings joy to the life of so many, from the distraught Lottie to the servant girl Becky, with whom all contact is strictly forbidden. Her fall from grace to her gradual renewal of faith is just beautiful to watch in a performance not matched until Rachel Hurd-Wood played Wendy in 2003's &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Likewise, Liam Cunningham as Captain Crewe plays a devoted father, and I loved how his scenes of war coincided with Sara's storytelling: the magic poison of the demon Ravana becomes mustard-gas in the trenches, and Ravana's roars become the scream of war-planes overhead.Eleanor Bron excellently plays the aristocratic Miss Minchin, with her exterior of charisma, grace and culture underlying her inner spite and nastiness. However, Bron does not play her simply as the one-dimensional bad guy, and neither is she without her moments of humanity: she obviously finds it difficult in telling Sara that her father has died, and when Sara finally confronts her head-on, Minchin's hastily wiped-away tears tell us better than any words that she never had a father as loving as Sara's was.Alfonso Cuaron directs &quot;A Little Princess&quot; and does so beautifully, from the povery-stricken streets of New York, where a single yellow rose is the only splash of colour, to the bright and exotic worlds of India that appear at intervals as Sara tells the mythological tale of Rama and Sita throughout the movie(and it's interesting to note that the actors that play these two lovers are the same that play Sara's own mother and father!) There are some sublime moments of imagery and beauty captured here, including the flower-sellers in the streets, Sara threading the dew-covered rose in the handle of the door, the black-clad lawyer watching the laughing girls, Sara spinning in the snow storm at her window...I could go on. And as all these scenes are coupled with appropriate music, be it strains of exotic India or a sorrowful choir, they remain in your mind for a very long time. In the simplist possible terms, this is a beautiful movie.There are some things I didn't particulary like, such as the amnesia plot device that they use on Captain Crewe (though I admit there wasn't really a way around this), the fact that Sara has the upper body strength of a grown man when she manages to hoist herself up on the windowsill by her fingertips, and the completely un-neccessary love story between Minchin's sister and the milkman. However, worst for me was the last scene in which Miss Minchin appears: beforehand we had witnessed the depths of her her wickedness when she lies about Sara's parentage even though Captain Crewe is standing right before her. After the father and daughter's tearful reunion, we see her standing in the rain and turning away, alone with her hate. Her story should have ended here with this powerful scene, but instead we get a truly awful continuation where she is working as a chimney-sweep - a conclusion as implausible as it is silly. I close my eyes and fast-forward every time I see it.Although ultimately I think I liked &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; more, &quot;A Little Princess&quot; is its more than worthy follow-up, with almost every particular magnificently created (though incredibly different from the original novel!) See it - it's a thousand times better than any of the rubbish aimed at kids these days (&quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; anyone?) and I look forward to seeing more of Alfonso Cuaron's work in the next

87797,ANEDXRFDZDL18,0790725657,Serene Night,"[1, 1]","A Little Princess is based on the 19th century novel entitled ""Sara Crewe: Or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's boarding school."" The story and most film versions are similar but have some intriguing differences including a happier ending which I prefer. This story is so popular that it has inspired several remakes. While this remake is by no means the /best/ I have seen, it is definitely quite entertaining and solid, and visually stunning, if a bit `kidified.'Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews)is a likeable young girl raised in India whose father is rich and leaves her at a boarding school in NYC to pursue a career in the army. Her unconventional outlook is quite different than the other girls her age who are all somewhat cowed by the two headmistresses.  Sara befriends several girls, and alienates Lavinia, Miss Minchin senior's favorite. After her father's assets are seized, Miss Minchin does the unthinkable- she forces Sara to become a servant. Sara's hard work and perseverance are not dampened by Miss Minchin's cruel treatment and endear even her worse enemies in the end.I felt the actress who played the young girls Sarah and Becky were quite well done, as well as Lavinia and Hermengarde. Miss Minchin's senior and junior were well portrayed. I felt the father's acting was rather weak, and did not like the change from London to New York which dampened the `Dickensian feel' that the original possesses.The school is a beautiful building, though, all shades of rich bottle green, and simply must be seen for the setting alone.*****Spoiler Section *******There were things I preferred that they do better.Miss Minchin's cruelty to Sara was never explained. I think they should've fleshed out this character a bit, to explain why she was so threatened by Sara and why she was so hard. Likely, she herself had been abandoned and left in a boarding school and had all her dreams and hopes dashed.The turnabout from Lavina at the end was also sort of `tacked on' and unbelievable. Bullies can and do change. But not without some reason. No reason is given.I felt the ending was silly with Miss Minchin becoming a chimney sweep.  That probably appeals to the small kids to see the `villain' punished, but I found it silly.The `princess mantra' got a bit much. I realize Disney made being a princess popular amongst kids, however I think it stereotypes girls and tells them they are `special no matter what' is simply not true. Everyone deserves life, love and happiness and you do not have to be anyone but yourself to get that.End SpoilersThis is a solid work, sure to entertain kids and those who like ""A Little Princess.""",4,Entertaining,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,2634,"['Little', 'Princess', 'based', '19th', 'century', 'novel', 'entitled', 'Sara', 'Crewe', 'What', 'Happened', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'boarding', 'school', 'story', 'most', 'film', 'versions', 'are', 'similar', 'have', 'intriguing', 'differences', 'including', 'happier', 'ending', 'prefer', 'story', 'so', 'popular', 'inspired', 'several', 'remakes', 'remake', '/best/', 'have', 'seen', 'definitely', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'solid', 'visually', 'stunning', 'bit', 'kidified', ""'Sara"", 'Crewe', 'Liesel', 'Matthews', 'likeable', 'young', 'girl', 'raised', 'India', 'father', 'rich', 'boarding', 'school', 'NYC', 'pursue', 'career', 'army', 'unconventional', 'outlook', 'quite', 'different', 'other', 'girls', 'age', 'who', 'are', 'somewhat', 'cowed', 'two', 'headmistresses', 'Sara', 'several', 'girls', 'Lavinia', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'senior', 'favorite', 'father', 'assets', 'are', 'seized', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'unthinkable-', 'Sara', 'become', 'servant', 'Sara', 'hard', 'work', 'perseverance', 'are', 'not', 'dampened', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'cruel', 'treatment', 'endear', 'even', 'worse', 'enemies', 'end.I', 'felt', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'girls', 'Sarah', 'Becky', 'were', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'Lavinia', 'Hermengarde', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'senior', 'junior', 'were', 'well', 'portrayed', 'felt', 'father', 'acting', 'was', 'rather', 'weak', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'London', 'New', 'York', 'dampened', 'Dickensian', 'feel', 'original', 'possesses.The', 'school', 'beautiful', 'building', 'shades', 'rich', 'bottle', 'green', 'simply', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'setting', 'alone', '*****Spoiler', 'Section', 'were', 'things', 'preferred', 'do', 'better.Miss', 'Minchin', 'cruelty', 'Sara', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'bit', 'explain', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'threatened', 'Sara', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'Likely', 'had', 'been', 'abandoned', 'left', 'boarding', 'school', 'had', 'dreams', 'dashed.The', 'turnabout', 'Lavina', 'end', 'was', 'also', 'sort', 'tacked', 'unbelievable', 'Bullies', 'can', 'do', 'change', 'not', 'reason', 'reason', 'given.I', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'silly', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'becoming', 'chimney', 'sweep', 'probably', 'appeals', 'small', 'kids', 'see', 'villain', 'punished', 'found', 'silly.The', 'princess', 'mantra', 'got', 'bit', 'much', 'realize', 'Disney', 'made', 'being', 'princess', 'popular', 'amongst', 'kids', 'however', 'think', 'girls', 'tells', 'are', 'special', 'matter', 'what', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'Everyone', 'life', 'love', 'happiness', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'anyone', 'get', 'that.End', 'SpoilersThis', 'solid', 'work', 'sure', 'entertain', 'kids', 'who', 'like', 'Little', 'Princess']",A Little Princess VHS

A small but important part of the action takes place in images from East Indian imagination.The movie apparently teaches that make-believe can transform your world and make it wonderful, though the teaching is undercut by the slapstick ending of a comic romance and elopement.Fantasy stories can help us see clearly and prepare us for real life, but I don't think this one does so.

Sara has all she could ever want at the school, the most delightful riches and confort and a bunch of new friends, however, when Miss Minchin informs Sara that her father has been killed in war, Sara is then turned into a servant.  She is now required to work for the school in order for Miss Minchin to recover the financial losses caused by Captain Crewe's tragic death.This Warner Brothers film is wonderfully done.  Very detailed surroundings give the movie a believable air that it is set in a more old-fashioned New York.  Liesel Matthews does a magnificent job of portraying the main character, Sara Crewe as well as all the other actors and actrices portraying their own characters.  I have never read the original F. H. Burnett book, although I have a copy and I plan on reading it soon, so I can't really compare the movie to the book.  Either way, the movie is definitely an inspiration to reading the novel, which I expect to be quite different based on other viewers' reviews.  I almost forgot to mention that the movie has beautiful music, nice soft ballads that are a combination of a classical rhythm and an indian-like chorus, as well as the repeated addition of the lovely song, ""Kindle My Heart.""If you enjoy this movie, I also recommend viewing the 1993 version of The Secret Garden, filmed by the same studio.

If you read the book you would be amazed at how far they strayed.  1.  The story is supposed to take place in England, not New York.  2.  The story is supposed to take place in Victorian times, not during WW1! 3.  The father really dies, he doesn't come back, and he dies from a fever, not on a battlefield.  4.  There is absolutely no locket in the entire book, yet it is one of the biggest storylines in the movie.  5.  The whole idea of the movie is to examine the riches to rags theme, how people treat you, how you behave like a princess no matter what condition you are in, and treat others the same way, and is a sound portrayal of the lowerclass life in Victorian England; cook, skivies, maids of all work, etc.  And the many homeless children on the street.  We don't even get to see Carrisford and his legal advisors searching for Sarah, all over the world, only to find out she is living in the attic one house over.  In other words, you are your neighbour's keeper.  If you want to see an accurate portrayal of this treasured novel, please watch the 1986 BBC production starring Amelia Shankely.  This movie, cute as it is, shouldn't even bear the title.  Oh, and completely forget her walking a plank to get to the neighbour's house.  That doesn't happen in the book, either.  Nor does the reading and stories at night, nor the attempt to get a necklace back, nor the sister escaping with the milkman, nor the spell on Lavinia's hair.  And Lavinia doesn't get Sarah's room, either.  That goes to a new student.

Leslie Matthews is superb as Sara, and Liam Cunningham is excellent doubling as both her father, Captain Crewe, and as Prince Rama. The entire cast is wonderful. I love the scenes in the beginning set in India. They set just the right magical mood for the story. I also love the scenes in the attic at Miss Minchin's. They are fun and imaginative. The escape across the rooftops is actually suspenseful in this version - it wasn't in the Shirley Temple film. Most everything is more effective. The Temple version was carrying so much political baggage at the time that it weighed the story down. Thankfully, this one is free to fly. And the ending is far, far more satisfying.The theme, ""every girl is a princess,"" is universal and timeless, and one that every little girl should hear and believe. And what better way than in this classic tale presented so well by filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron.

True there were qirky moments (like in the enactment of the story that Sara tells) but they fit the movie, providing complementations rather than breaking the story. The script was simplistic and even a little sappy but the acting was supperb even then on all performer's parts. Thus the performances were fantasitc, and the editing was on the mark.All in all, what I thought would be a ""girl-child"" movie turned out to be a movie that ALL audiences could get into, and stay with from the beginning to the end.

Based upon the beloved children's classic, this adaptation begins with Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews) regaling her Indian friend and Indian nanny with a mythological tale in Simla, India in 1914. Sara's father decides to send her to New York to study at the same boarding school attended by Sara's late mother. Given Sara's wealth, she is given a warm welcome by the haughty and greedy headmistress (Eleanor Bron) whilst Sara's father goes off to fight in the first world war.Sara's free-spiritedness is stifled by the domineering headmistress, and when tragedy strikes, Sara finds herself being kept on at the school in the capacity of a housemaid where she is treated abominably. Her only happiness comes from her flights of imagination, until Sara is finally able to find true happiness.The ending diverges from the book, but I felt this was ok given that the audience for such movies are usually young children. My kindergartner was satisfied with the happy ending, though we also know how the book ends (we read it prior to viewing the movie). The lead actress who plays Sara Crewe, Liesel Matthews credibly captures the strong will and determination of the spunky heroine.
