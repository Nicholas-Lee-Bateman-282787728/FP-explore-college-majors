On the equipment, Ball $2 at Tjmax, the band and light weights $4.50 at Play It Again Sports. This is a 150 minutes of video for $9.99, still a great deal with the added $6.50 in equipment. The rest who cares, it's just cosmetic. On the actual video, the warm ups and cool downs are great, I use them to augment some of my other videos that don't have good warm ups or cool downs. The workouts are quick and fast pace, which is why I bought them, for days when I don't have a lot of time. If one of the workouts isn't enough for you just repeat it as a circuit, or pause the video and do extra reps of each exercise. I do not recommend ever doing a workout that isn't for your trimester and month of pregnancy. I really liked that the workouts are completely different for each month of your trimester for the first two trimesters, you can really get board of the same workout. The exercises are good, safe, and challenging, most of them are different from all the other videos I have reviewed. I am also very happy to finally have abdominal work explained for the second trimester, such as splinting your abs. However I have to add for the same price you can get her Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy Workout video which has third trimester workouts and postnatal workoutsGabrielle Reece: The Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy",4,The Content,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,1508,"['First', 'must', 'say', 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'addressing', 'how', 'great', 'Gabby', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'trainer', 'background', 'quality', 'buying', 'ball', 'weights', 'band', 'equipment', 'Ball', '2', 'Tjmax', 'band', 'light', 'weights', '4.50', 'Play', 'Again', 'Sports', '150', 'minutes', 'video', '9.99', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'added', '6.50', 'equipment', 'rest', 'who', 'just', 'cosmetic', 'actual', 'video', 'warm', 'ups', 'cool', 'downs', 'are', 'great', 'use', 'augment', 'other', 'videos', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'warm', 'ups', 'cool', 'downs', 'workouts', 'are', 'quick', 'fast', 'pace', 'why', 'bought', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'one', 'workouts', ""n't"", 'enough', 'just', 'repeat', 'circuit', 'video', 'do', 'extra', 'reps', 'exercise', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'ever', 'doing', 'workout', ""n't"", 'trimester', 'month', 'pregnancy', 'really', 'liked', 'workouts', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'month', 'trimester', 'first', 'two', 'trimesters', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'board', 'same', 'workout', 'exercises', 'are', 'good', 'safe', 'challenging', 'most', 'are', 'different', 'other', 'videos', 'have', 'reviewed', 'am', 'also', 'very', 'happy', 'finally', 'have', 'abdominal', 'work', 'explained', 'second', 'trimester', 'such', 'splinting', 'abs', 'However', 'have', 'add', 'same', 'price', 'can', 'get', 'Complete', 'Fit', 'Healthy', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'video', 'third', 'trimester', 'workouts', 'postnatal', 'workoutsGabrielle', 'Reece', 'Complete', 'Fit', 'Healthy', 'Pregnancy']",Gabrielle Reece - Fit and Healthy Prenatal Workouts

Offering a month-by-month pregnancy workout program covering the first and second trimesters, as demonstrated by Gabrielle Reece while carrying her second child, Fit & Healthy Prenatal Workouts is an excellent baby or bridal shower gift. An inexpensive exercise ball, fitness band, and small hand weights are recommended but not required, and all pregnant women should consult their physicians before embarking on an exercise program - but if the physician OKs it, then Fit & Healthy Prenatal Workouts is definitely one of the best workout options available!

1119675,AQYY2OH4BRCZG,B000YGGNEW,"Ms. Piper Valentine ""jet_set""","[1, 1]","I am trying out all the prenatal DVDs I can get my hand on, granted, I didn't start these until 30 weeks because I work all the time and mostly just use the elliptical.  I'm an obstetrician, and honestly you don't need to use workout specific to pregnancy in the first trimester and really in the beginning of the second trimester either.  This is why this video is so ridiculous - it has a new workout for each month you are pregnant up until 6 months (24 weeks), which isn't even into the 3rd trimester yet.  First off, most people don't even find out they are pregnancy until they are at least 4 weeks along (you miss your first cycle at 4 weeks.)  I think they hardest time to find appropriate y, that,exercise is as you get more and more pregnant, so it just seems ridiculous to me that this only goes until 24 weeks.Not only that, I didn't actually bother to do the workouts because I was 30 weeks along when I got it from Netflix, but I watched part of it anyways and Gabi Reece seemed totally disengaged from the workout and the trainer and it looked pretty boring.She apparently has a different pregnancy video, and I plan on trying that one too.

1119676,A1WJB8XX7ZC9H9,B000YGGNEW,"Nicole Domini ""Nicole Domini""","[9, 11]","I saw this featured in Fit Pregnancy and thought this would be a great workout dvd, but I ended up hating it.First of all, you will need a chair, hand weights, an exercise band, a towel, a yoga ball... quite a bit of props, I think, for a 15 minute workout session!  What was worse was that it was not mentioned ANYWHERE on the dvd packaging or even in the introduction to the workouts that you would be needing any of these.  So on the first day I was ready to workout, I got all geared up, only to realize I didn't own half of the props I needed, so I wasn't able to do the workout, and instead had to wait until I went out and bought the necessary equipment.Once I got the equipment, I realized, this workout is ridiculous!  I think I burn more calories jumping up to get my ball, then my strap, then my weights, then my chair, then my ball and my chair... than actually doing the exercises.  What makes it worse is that Gabrielle has her personal trainer with her who hands her each of the props, so she is able to start the next set of exercises right away.  Since I don't have a personal trainer on hand, I have to get up and get the props by myself.  By the time I get situated, Gabrielle is already well into her exercises.And on the subject of the trainer:  he is really really annoying.  Everytime Gabrielle tries to get a word in, even if it's just a sarcastic joke, he talks right over her.  He interrupts her constantly, and this is really annoying to me.I also didn't get the impression that Gabrielle and her trainer ever rehearsed this workout before filming.  As the trainer is trying to explain to Gabrielle how to prepare for an exercise, she's completely confused and seems to have no idea what he is talking about.I thought I'd like this workout, but I was very disappointed.  I even gave it about three tries before deciding to sell it back.I wouldn't recommend this dvd to anyone.~Nicole",2,"I wanted to like this, but...",1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,1910,"['saw', 'featured', 'Fit', 'Pregnancy', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'workout', 'dvd', 'ended', 'up', 'hating', 'it.First', 'will', 'need', 'chair', 'hand', 'weights', 'exercise', 'band', 'towel', 'yoga', 'ball', 'quite', 'bit', 'props', 'think', '15', 'minute', 'workout', 'session', 'What', 'was', 'worse', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'mentioned', 'ANYWHERE', 'dvd', 'packaging', 'even', 'introduction', 'workouts', 'would', 'be', 'needing', 'So', 'first', 'day', 'was', 'ready', 'workout', 'got', 'geared', 'up', 'only', 'realize', 'did', ""n't"", 'own', 'half', 'props', 'needed', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'do', 'workout', 'instead', 'had', 'wait', 'went', 'out', 'bought', 'necessary', 'equipment.Once', 'got', 'equipment', 'realized', 'workout', 'ridiculous', 'think', 'burn', 'more', 'calories', 'jumping', 'up', 'get', 'ball', 'then', 'strap', 'then', 'weights', 'then', 'chair', 'then', 'ball', 'chair', 'actually', 'doing', 'exercises', 'What', 'worse', 'Gabrielle', 'personal', 'trainer', 'who', 'props', 'able', 'start', 'next', 'set', 'exercises', 'right', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'personal', 'trainer', 'hand', 'have', 'get', 'up', 'get', 'props', 'time', 'get', 'situated', 'Gabrielle', 'already', 'well', 'exercises.And', 'subject', 'trainer', 'really', 'really', 'annoying', 'Everytime', 'Gabrielle', 'get', 'word', 'even', 'just', 'sarcastic', 'joke', 'right', 'constantly', 'really', 'annoying', 'me.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'Gabrielle', 'trainer', 'ever', 'rehearsed', 'workout', 'filming', 'trainer', 'trying', 'explain', 'Gabrielle', 'how', 'prepare', 'exercise', 'completely', 'confused', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'talking', 'about.I', 'thought', ""'d"", 'like', 'workout', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'even', 'gave', 'three', 'tries', 'deciding', 'sell', 'back.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'dvd', 'anyone.~Nicole']",Gabrielle Reece - Fit and Healthy Prenatal Workouts
