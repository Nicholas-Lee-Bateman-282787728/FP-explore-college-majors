1460259,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005GNU5N8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 7]","- A customer in December: ""Well, I'm here to take my tree.""- The gruff tree lot proprietor: ""You're late. Christmas comes in November around here.""So around this season - this holiday season - the sentimental bug takes a big bite out of me, and I'm left walking around wishing people merry this and happy that and slipping a dollar or two in those donation pots outside them shopping stores. Around this season, I am an easy touch. And a holiday movie would have to really suck arse for me to get all up on its case. And if you think that preamble is set up so I can bag on NOVEMBER CHRISTMAS, think again.NOVEMBER CHRISTMAS premiered on CBS in 2010, and it became an instant modern classic. It is enchanting. Not in the sense that something magical happens in terms of angels and elves and flying reindeer. This film grounds itself in more mundane context. It posits that an entire community can pull together and, with kindness and humanity and extra effort, achieve something extraordinary and, yep, magical. There's a lot of Christmas movies out there. I challenge any of those to present a truer depiction of the meaning and the spirit of Christmas.This movie is populated with established actors like Sam Elliott, John Corbett, Sarah Paulson and Karen Allen. And yet an utterly captivating performance by a young girl named Emily Alyn Lind is what lingers days and weeks and years later. In a Rhode Island town, she plays 8-year-old Vanessa Marks, a very, very sick girl who nonetheless keeps up a good front. Fearing the worst, her parents (Corbett and Paulson) decide to speed up the holidays so that she could experience them one last time. In August, when the father asks the local farmer (Elliott, gracefully aging) if he had any pumpkins and, weeks later (but still prematurely), if he could tag a Christmas tree off the Christmas tree lot, the perceptive farmer suspects what the father is up to and plays along. And soon the small Rhode Island town is playing along.This film doesn't only focus on the embattled Marks family. Other characters are featured and, over time, one by one, we learn how they impact the life of little Vanessa. One of my favorite characters is the teen waitress (Elizabeth McLaughlin) with the checkered past who aspires to be a children's writer and ends up befriending Vanessa. Anyway, I really, really like this movie. It checks all the boxes required for an entertaining and meaningful holiday film. The word ""heartwarming"" is applied ad nauseam to films like this. Except that NOVEMBER CHRISTMAS absolutely earns that word. Caution: You may need a hankie.Note that this film is adapted from Greg Coppa's short story. He wrote a short story sequel titled ""A Partridge in a Persimmon Tree"" which takes place twelve years after ""November Christmas"" and focuses on Sam Elliott's character, farmer Jesse Sanford. Both stories are collected in his anthology November Christmas & Other Short Stories, which is available on Kindle.",5,hope in a snow globe... instantly one of my very favorite Christmas movies...,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,2968,"['customer', 'December', 'Well', ""'m"", 'here', 'take', 'tree', 'gruff', 'tree', 'lot', 'proprietor', ""'re"", 'late', 'Christmas', 'November', 'here', 'So', 'season', 'holiday', 'season', 'sentimental', 'bug', 'big', 'bite', ""'m"", 'left', 'walking', 'wishing', 'people', 'merry', 'happy', 'slipping', 'dollar', 'two', 'donation', 'pots', 'shopping', 'stores', 'season', 'am', 'easy', 'touch', 'holiday', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'suck', 'arse', 'get', 'up', 'case', 'think', 'preamble', 'set', 'up', 'can', 'bag', 'NOVEMBER', 'CHRISTMAS', 'think', 'again.NOVEMBER', 'CHRISTMAS', 'premiered', 'CBS', '2010', 'became', 'instant', 'modern', 'classic', 'enchanting', 'Not', 'sense', 'something', 'magical', 'happens', 'terms', 'angels', 'elves', 'flying', 'reindeer', 'film', 'more', 'mundane', 'context', 'entire', 'community', 'can', 'pull', 'together', 'kindness', 'humanity', 'extra', 'effort', 'achieve', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'yep', 'magical', 'lot', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'challenge', 'present', 'truer', 'depiction', 'meaning', 'spirit', 'Christmas.This', 'movie', 'populated', 'established', 'actors', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'John', 'Corbett', 'Sarah', 'Paulson', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'yet', 'utterly', 'captivating', 'performance', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Emily', 'Alyn', 'Lind', 'what', 'days', 'weeks', 'years', 'later', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'town', '8-year-old', 'Vanessa', 'Marks', 'very', 'very', 'sick', 'girl', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'up', 'good', 'front', 'Fearing', 'worst', 'parents', 'Corbett', 'Paulson', 'decide', 'speed', 'up', 'holidays', 'could', 'experience', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'August', 'when', 'father', 'local', 'farmer', 'Elliott', 'gracefully', 'aging', 'had', 'pumpkins', 'weeks', 'later', 'still', 'prematurely', 'could', 'tag', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'lot', 'perceptive', 'farmer', 'what', 'father', 'plays', 'along', 'soon', 'small', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'town', 'playing', 'along.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'only', 'focus', 'embattled', 'Marks', 'family', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'featured', 'time', 'one', 'one', 'learn', 'how', 'impact', 'life', 'little', 'Vanessa', 'One', 'favorite', 'characters', 'teen', 'waitress', 'Elizabeth', 'McLaughlin', 'checkered', 'past', 'who', 'be', 'children', 'writer', 'up', 'befriending', 'Vanessa', 'Anyway', 'really', 'really', 'movie', 'boxes', 'required', 'entertaining', 'meaningful', 'holiday', 'film', 'word', 'heartwarming', 'applied', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'films', 'NOVEMBER', 'CHRISTMAS', 'absolutely', 'word', 'Caution', 'may', 'need', 'hankie.Note', 'film', 'adapted', 'Greg', 'Coppa', 'short', 'story', 'wrote', 'short', 'story', 'sequel', 'titled', 'Partridge', 'Persimmon', 'Tree', 'place', 'twelve', 'years', 'November', 'Christmas', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'character', 'farmer', 'Jesse', 'Sanford', 'stories', 'are', 'collected', 'anthology', 'November', 'Christmas', 'Other', 'Short', 'Stories', 'available', 'Kindle']",November Christmas
