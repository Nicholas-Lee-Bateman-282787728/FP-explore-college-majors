For one reason or another, Pioneer ended up with the rights to the first 3 DBZ movies (Instead of FUNimation), and the end results speak for themselves! This thing just screams quality! The dubbing is good, and very close to the original Japanesse script (FUNimation NEVER came close to being on the dot)! The music is left untouched, and you even get to hear the ORIGINAL theme song! After hearing this it's hard to think kind of the American theme songs and score.Not to mention the DVD has better picture quality then the FUNimation releases! Folks, I don't know if buying enough of these means Pioneer will be able to dub more DBZ (Although it won't likely ever happen again), but it's nice to have a company know what they're doing for once!

Dead Zone was too short (but was very good), Tree of Might was a re-dub for video and really was bad with the  acting (it was exhilerating to see Gohans wee-wee again,though,....... uh  wait, never mind) but The World's Strongest takes the cake with some of the  best scenes of fighting ever and possibly the best dub ever.  When Goku  (voiced by Peter Kelamis who is not that good as Goku, or at least not as  good as the first Goku, Ian Corlett) screams  &quot;KAAAIIIOOOO-KENNNNNNNNN&quot; you will literally feel chills down  your spinal chord.

The title theme for the movie 'Head-cha-la' was really neat, and I liked  it muchly.The fighting scenes, and the original North American seiyuu  also made this movie cool, with the great way it was dubbed, the newer  voices wouldn't have done as good as a job.So, out of the three movies  I've seen so far, 'The Tree of Might' and 'Dead Zone', this is the best of  all three.  I can't wait until the next movie gets released.
