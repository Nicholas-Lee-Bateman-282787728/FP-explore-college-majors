I do hope that is covered on this or one of the future sets. I'd be nice of Shannon actually joined the rest of the cast in a Look Back featurette. I don't know if she'll be there nor would I actually count of it. But in my opinion, Shannon was the best Jo. As for the second Jo, had Shannon remained or came back to the show, the second Jo could have been someone new so there would be 4 Borgs - 2 guys and 2 girls. All the monsters were fu ny I.

The series itself had a good story line and while some of the characters were a bit over the top, that's what makes the series as fun as it was. One of the things that I liked best was that it brought me back to when I was a kid reading comics. Each time I picked up a comic I wished that I too could find the mutant M on my hand as I got older. This series showed three kids who had their dream come true. The other thing that was great about this was that you had the chance to see the first 27 episodes, and while there will be more that will be coming, this was a great first start!",5,A Great DVD Set!,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,709,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'back', '1990', 'so', 'watching', 'was', 'fun', 'always', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'new', 'television', 'series', 'series', 'had', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'were', 'bit', 'top', 'what', 'series', 'as', 'fun', 'was', 'One', 'things', 'liked', 'best', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'reading', 'comics', 'time', 'picked', 'up', 'comic', 'wished', 'too', 'could', 'find', 'mutant', 'M', 'hand', 'got', 'older', 'series', 'showed', 'three', 'kids', 'who', 'had', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'other', 'thing', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'first', '27', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'start']","Big Bad Beetleborgs: Season 1, Vol. 1"

Everything they touched turned to gold. Digimon, Spiderman, X-men, Power Rangers, why it's enough to make King Midas seethe with jealously.But then their main cash cow Power Rangers started to droop by the wayside in the ratings department and they began to look elsewhere for well of steady cash. So they imported once again from the land of the rising sun and got to work. The results were, shall we say, less than desirable.First there was VR Troopers, a once intially planned gateway show for Jason David Frank's acting career after he ended his tenure as the Green Ranger. Then there was Masked Rider, the less said about that the better and then, Beetleborgs.The premise is as follows: Three ""average joe"" children who love comic books stumble into a haunted house on a dare and free an Elvis impersonator ghoul who moonlights as a genie from his prison in a piano organ. As a reward, he imbues them with the likeness of their favorite superheroes, the Big Bad Beetleborgs (Red Striker, Blue Stinger, and Green Hunter respectively). However, this also results in the freeing of the Beetleborg's arch villians, the Magnavores and their treacherous hordes of no good nicks. To further combat these foes, the children are also given individual superpowers such as telekinesis, super speed, and super strength.While it seems like a brilliant idea in theory, combining monster movies with comic books and children's natural love of insects, it falls incredibly short. Namely in the writing department (cringe worthy dialogue be damned). This had to due with another internal issue that Saban was going through, ""Do we write serious or comedic shows?"". The best example of this is Power Rangers Turbo, which decided to follow it's source material's (Gekisou Sentai Carranger) lead with devastating results.So was this show the victim of unfair treatment by it's writing staff? I think a standing ovation of ""YES"" at the highest octave possible is in order.",2,"One ""Big Bad"" Pun After Another (Or The Butchering Of An Otherwise Great Concept)",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,2070,"['Haim', 'Saban', 'Shuki', 'Levy', 'owned', '90', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Krofft', 'owned', '70', 'make', 'mistake', 'Everything', 'touched', 'turned', 'gold', 'Digimon', 'Spiderman', 'X-men', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'why', 'enough', 'make', 'King', 'Midas', 'seethe', 'jealously.But', 'then', 'main', 'cash', 'cow', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'started', 'droop', 'wayside', 'ratings', 'department', 'began', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'well', 'steady', 'cash', 'imported', 'once', 'again', 'land', 'rising', 'sun', 'got', 'work', 'results', 'were', 'shall', 'say', 'less', 'desirable.First', 'was', 'VR', 'Troopers', 'once', 'intially', 'planned', 'gateway', 'show', 'Jason', 'David', 'Frank', 'acting', 'career', 'ended', 'tenure', 'Green', 'Ranger', 'Then', 'was', 'Masked', 'Rider', 'less', 'said', 'better', 'then', 'Beetleborgs.The', 'premise', 'Three', 'average', 'joe', 'children', 'who', 'love', 'comic', 'books', 'stumble', 'haunted', 'house', 'dare', 'free', 'Elvis', 'impersonator', 'ghoul', 'who', 'genie', 'prison', 'piano', 'organ', 'reward', 'likeness', 'favorite', 'superheroes', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Beetleborgs', 'Red', 'Striker', 'Blue', 'Stinger', 'Green', 'Hunter', 'respectively', 'However', 'also', 'results', 'freeing', 'Beetleborg', 'arch', 'villians', 'Magnavores', 'treacherous', 'hordes', 'good', 'nicks', 'further', 'combat', 'foes', 'children', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'individual', 'superpowers', 'such', 'telekinesis', 'super', 'speed', 'super', 'strength.While', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'theory', 'combining', 'monster', 'movies', 'comic', 'books', 'children', 'natural', 'love', 'insects', 'incredibly', 'short', 'Namely', 'writing', 'department', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'dialogue', 'be', 'damned', 'had', 'due', 'internal', 'issue', 'Saban', 'was', 'going', 'Do', 'write', 'serious', 'comedic', 'shows', 'best', 'example', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Turbo', 'decided', 'follow', 'source', 'material', 'Gekisou', 'Sentai', 'Carranger', 'lead', 'devastating', 'results.So', 'was', 'show', 'victim', 'unfair', 'treatment', 'writing', 'staff', 'think', 'standing', 'ovation', 'YES', 'highest', 'octave', 'possible', 'order']","Big Bad Beetleborgs: Season 1, Vol. 1"
