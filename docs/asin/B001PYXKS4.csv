1230147,A3UWYCISNFHO2X,B001PYXKS4,albarino,"[0, 0]","I saw this as a DVD in 2013. I'll not summarize the narrative of TES as that is already available on this page. I found TES to be in the ranks of a number of very strong documentaries, but in my view it isn't quite the status of an essential, must-have timeless classic. The hand-held camera, you-are-there approach is not new, though it is indeed effectively used here. Finally, I consider my 4-star rating a solid endorsement.The strength of the film is in its capacity to get viewers ""into"" the disorganized and corrupt medical environment in post-Soviet Ukraine and the people who have little choice but to rely upon it. The film gets its recognition, I believe, because of the novelty of its subject -- heroic neuro-surgery under very challenging conditions in a little known country -- and the vulnerable and hopeful humanity of patients and families yearning to be cured of their brain tumors. My (and virtually all viewers) empathy and compassion went out to the family of the young girl who died after a very challenging surgery, as well as to Marian, the young man whose tumor caused him to have epileptic episodes. However, Marian's skull-invasive surgery -- photographed up close and personal -- was happily successful. Male viewers will never again look at a cordless drill as a mere construction tool!Though I found TES to be overall engaging, the strong subject matter of neuro-surgery as pioneered by Drs. Henry Marsh and his Ukrainian colleague, Dr. Igor Kurilets, was not sufficient for me to award a 5th star, top rating. What the film lacked was an interpretive voice to provide a moral context, an evaluative insight/reflection on the work of Marsh and Kurilets. While it was important to hear their back-and-forth dialogue throughout the film, a few important matters went unaddressed.For example, towards the end of TES, Marsh remarks after Marian's surgery -- paraphrasing here -- that our entire self comes from the physicality of our brains. I was astonished by this reductive conclusion, since it cannot account for the altruism that has brought Marsh to repeatedly volunteer in a daunting environment for 15 years. And at the end, he rhetorically observes, ""if we cannot help people, we are nothing."" Well, who says? There is another British brain scientist (not mentioned in TES) who claims we have determining neuro-patterns that cause us to selfishly aggrandize ourselves, families, clans to the exclusion of outsiders. This is supposedly because we are evolutionarily and genetically wired to selfishness from early humankind's survival struggles in a harsh climate of scarcity.What then is it in Marsh's ""brain"" that has drawn him to help the helpless, provide hope? What is it in OUR ""brains"" that entertains and causes us to thrive on hope? Answer: it isn't our brains and their chemistry. Rather it is in our MINDS, from which springs our conscience, compassion, desire for love and justice ..... and sense of transcendence. Give THAT some THOUGHT. (And while you are at it, attend to this very matter by reading Marilynne Robinson'sAbsence of Mind: The Dispelling of Inwardness from the Modern Myth of the Self (The Terry Lectures Series)Earlier in the film, Marian attends his local Orthodox Church where the congregation is gathered in the multi-icon presence of God, Jesus, Mary and the Saints. They sing the liturgy with the priest -- a community being renewed by God's grace in difficult times. As they file out of the worship service, the congregation drops scarce money into Marian's hat to pay for his surgery: mindful caritas in action, a no-brainer, don'cha think?",4,"Dr. Marsh says: ""Our humanity is the physicality of our brains"" (OH????)",1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,3611,"['saw', 'DVD', '2013', ""'ll"", 'not', 'summarize', 'narrative', 'TES', 'already', 'available', 'page', 'found', 'TES', 'be', 'ranks', 'number', 'very', 'strong', 'documentaries', 'view', ""n't"", 'quite', 'status', 'essential', 'must-have', 'timeless', 'classic', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'you-are-there', 'approach', 'not', 'new', 'indeed', 'effectively', 'used', 'here', 'Finally', 'consider', '4-star', 'rating', 'solid', 'endorsement.The', 'strength', 'film', 'capacity', 'get', 'viewers', 'disorganized', 'corrupt', 'medical', 'environment', 'post-Soviet', 'Ukraine', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'choice', 'rely', 'film', 'recognition', 'believe', 'novelty', 'subject', 'heroic', 'neuro-surgery', 'very', 'challenging', 'conditions', 'little', 'known', 'country', 'vulnerable', 'hopeful', 'humanity', 'patients', 'families', 'yearning', 'be', 'cured', 'brain', 'tumors', 'My', 'virtually', 'viewers', 'empathy', 'compassion', 'went', 'family', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'died', 'very', 'challenging', 'surgery', 'as', 'well', 'Marian', 'young', 'man', 'tumor', 'caused', 'have', 'epileptic', 'episodes', 'However', 'Marian', 'skull-invasive', 'surgery', 'photographed', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'was', 'happily', 'successful', 'Male', 'viewers', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'look', 'cordless', 'drill', 'mere', 'construction', 'tool', 'found', 'TES', 'be', 'overall', 'engaging', 'strong', 'subject', 'matter', 'neuro-surgery', 'pioneered', 'Drs', 'Henry', 'Marsh', 'Ukrainian', 'colleague', 'Dr.', 'Igor', 'Kurilets', 'was', 'not', 'sufficient', 'award', '5th', 'star', 'top', 'rating', 'What', 'film', 'lacked', 'was', 'interpretive', 'voice', 'provide', 'moral', 'context', 'evaluative', 'insight/reflection', 'work', 'Marsh', 'Kurilets', 'was', 'important', 'hear', 'back-and-forth', 'dialogue', 'film', 'few', 'important', 'matters', 'went', 'unaddressed.For', 'example', 'end', 'TES', 'Marsh', 'remarks', 'Marian', 'surgery', 'paraphrasing', 'here', 'entire', 'self', 'physicality', 'brains', 'was', 'astonished', 'reductive', 'conclusion', 'can', 'not', 'account', 'altruism', 'brought', 'Marsh', 'repeatedly', 'volunteer', 'daunting', 'environment', '15', 'years', 'end', 'rhetorically', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'people', 'are', 'nothing', 'Well', 'who', 'British', 'brain', 'scientist', 'not', 'mentioned', 'TES', 'who', 'have', 'determining', 'neuro-patterns', 'cause', 'selfishly', 'aggrandize', 'ourselves', 'families', 'clans', 'exclusion', 'outsiders', 'supposedly', 'are', 'evolutionarily', 'genetically', 'wired', 'selfishness', 'early', 'humankind', 'survival', 'harsh', 'climate', 'scarcity.What', 'then', 'Marsh', 'brain', 'drawn', 'help', 'helpless', 'provide', 'hope', 'What', 'OUR', 'brains', 'thrive', 'hope', 'Answer', ""n't"", 'brains', 'chemistry', 'MINDS', 'conscience', 'compassion', 'desire', 'love', 'justice', '..', 'sense', 'transcendence', 'Give', 'THOUGHT', 'are', 'attend', 'very', 'matter', 'reading', 'Marilynne', ""Robinson'sAbsence"", 'Mind', 'Dispelling', 'Inwardness', 'Modern', 'Myth', 'Self', 'Terry', 'Lectures', 'Series', 'Earlier', 'film', 'Marian', 'local', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'where', 'congregation', 'gathered', 'multi-icon', 'presence', 'God', 'Jesus', 'Mary', 'Saints', 'sing', 'liturgy', 'priest', 'community', 'being', 'renewed', 'God', 'grace', 'difficult', 'times', 'file', 'worship', 'service', 'congregation', 'scarce', 'money', 'Marian', 'hat', 'pay', 'surgery', 'mindful', 'caritas', 'action', 'no-brainer', ""don'cha"", 'think']",N/A

1230149,A167K0YA96FD56,B001PYXKS4,Ian Gordon Malcomson,"[0, 0]","By far one this is one of the most meaningful human-interest documentaries I have ever watched. It breathes a transcending sense of compassion and humanity not found in too many films these days. On the one hand we have an English brain surgeon, Dr. Henry Marsh, who has dedicated himself to rendering medical assistance to impoverished Ukrainians who have been diagnosed with life threatening tumors. Originally motivated by a personal experience as a young father of not being able to help his baby son, who had a life-threatening brain mass, Marsh has over the last fifteen years reached into the lives of dozens of Ukrainians and given them fresh hope. Teaming up with an equally inspiring Ukrainian internist, Igor, Marsh has performed some incredibly delicate operations under the most primitive of conditions. What makes this film worth watching is the detailed attention it gives to the operational procedures. While perhaps not suitable watching for the faint of heart, ""The English Surgeon"" does highlight the difficult conditions under which this very skillful man works, with relatively little guarantee of reward. The filmmaker takes time to look at diagnosis, treatment and follow-up from the patients' vantage. Many enter Marsh's antiquated operating room with mixed hope, plenty of courage, and a strong resolve to pull through. While there are some who make it, others tragically don't like Tara and another desperate young lady with inoperable brain cancer. Their stories are included as a reminder of the incontrovertible truth of modern medicine that while it has the power to cure it does not have the power to withstand death regardless of how strong the human will is. Out of this despair comes a sense of compassion that Marsh is able to share because he has been there many times before. It is not hard to see why Marsh has fallen in love with the people of this area, because like Christ in ancient times, he is dealing with a people who are visibly suffering because they need a physician they cannot afford.",5,Who are we if we can't help!,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,2035,"['far', 'one', 'one', 'most', 'meaningful', 'human-interest', 'documentaries', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'transcending', 'sense', 'compassion', 'humanity', 'not', 'found', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'days', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'English', 'brain', 'surgeon', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'Marsh', 'who', 'dedicated', 'rendering', 'medical', 'assistance', 'impoverished', 'Ukrainians', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'life', 'threatening', 'tumors', 'Originally', 'motivated', 'personal', 'experience', 'young', 'father', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'help', 'baby', 'son', 'who', 'had', 'life-threatening', 'brain', 'mass', 'Marsh', 'over', 'last', 'fifteen', 'years', 'reached', 'lives', 'dozens', 'Ukrainians', 'given', 'fresh', 'hope', 'Teaming', 'up', 'equally', 'inspiring', 'Ukrainian', 'internist', 'Igor', 'Marsh', 'performed', 'incredibly', 'delicate', 'operations', 'most', 'primitive', 'conditions', 'What', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'detailed', 'attention', 'operational', 'procedures', 'perhaps', 'not', 'suitable', 'watching', 'faint', 'heart', 'English', 'Surgeon', 'highlight', 'difficult', 'conditions', 'very', 'skillful', 'man', 'relatively', 'little', 'guarantee', 'reward', 'filmmaker', 'time', 'look', 'diagnosis', 'treatment', 'follow-up', 'patients', 'vantage', 'Many', 'enter', 'Marsh', 'antiquated', 'operating', 'room', 'mixed', 'hope', 'plenty', 'courage', 'strong', 'resolve', 'pull', 'are', 'who', 'make', 'others', 'tragically', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Tara', 'desperate', 'young', 'lady', 'inoperable', 'brain', 'cancer', 'stories', 'are', 'included', 'reminder', 'incontrovertible', 'truth', 'modern', 'medicine', 'power', 'cure', 'not', 'have', 'power', 'withstand', 'death', 'regardless', 'how', 'strong', 'human', 'will', 'despair', 'sense', 'compassion', 'Marsh', 'able', 'share', 'been', 'there', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'Marsh', 'fallen', 'love', 'people', 'area', 'Christ', 'ancient', 'times', 'dealing', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'visibly', 'suffering', 'need', 'physician', 'can', 'not', 'afford']",N/A
