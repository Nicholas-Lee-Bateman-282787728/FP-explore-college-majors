1027571,A1FDX34BXFXNS8,B000JLIYRQ,"Eric Rachut ""Furor teutonicus""","[14, 16]","To the foregoing reviews I would only add that Kolberg was and is in eastern Pomerania (Hinterpommern) and not East Prussia.  It is - at this moment in history -under Polish rule as a result of the ethnic cleansing of 1945. The Prussian queen (Luise) depicted was and is highly regarded by the Prussians both for her steadfastness against the French and her refusal to accede to her husband's Calvinism.The Prussian officer who organizes the defense of the town gives a speech in the city square, towards the end of the film.  You will note that as he does so his voice changes - into that of Hitler.  Audiences of the time would certainly have noticed this.The film was a pet project of Josef Goebbels, who diverted significant resources and thousands of troops (as extras) to its making.  One wonders what Gneisenau would have said about such trading of lives for glitz.The modern battle of Kolberg, at the close of World War II, was a bloody and pitiless affair fought out, ironically enough, not only between German defenders and Russian attackers, but between Frenchmen on the German side (Waffen-SS Division Charlemagne) and Germans (Communists) on the Soviet side.Since it accomplished nothing other than a weakening of the war effort, I would not rate this highly as propaganda, certainly not as highly as, say, Sieg im Westen or Alexander Nevsky.",3,DIVERSION OF WAR EFFORT,1289433600,"11 11, 2010",2010,1355,"['foregoing', 'reviews', 'would', 'only', 'add', 'Kolberg', 'was', 'eastern', 'Pomerania', 'Hinterpommern', 'not', 'East', 'Prussia', 'moment', 'history', '-under', 'Polish', 'rule', 'result', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', '1945', 'Prussian', 'queen', 'Luise', 'depicted', 'was', 'highly', 'regarded', 'Prussians', 'steadfastness', 'French', 'refusal', 'accede', 'husband', 'Calvinism.The', 'Prussian', 'officer', 'who', 'defense', 'town', 'speech', 'city', 'square', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'note', 'so', 'voice', 'changes', 'Hitler', 'Audiences', 'time', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'noticed', 'this.The', 'film', 'was', 'pet', 'project', 'Josef', 'Goebbels', 'who', 'diverted', 'significant', 'resources', 'thousands', 'troops', 'extras', 'making', 'One', 'Gneisenau', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'such', 'trading', 'lives', 'glitz.The', 'modern', 'battle', 'Kolberg', 'close', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'bloody', 'pitiless', 'affair', 'fought', 'out', 'ironically', 'enough', 'not', 'only', 'German', 'defenders', 'Russian', 'attackers', 'Frenchmen', 'German', 'side', 'Waffen-SS', 'Division', 'Charlemagne', 'Germans', 'Communists', 'Soviet', 'side.Since', 'accomplished', 'nothing', 'other', 'weakening', 'war', 'effort', 'would', 'not', 'rate', 'highly', 'propaganda', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'highly', 'say', 'Sieg', 'im', 'Westen', 'Alexander', 'Nevsky']",Kolberg: The Restored 1945 Epic
1027572,A2BSRSOG7B2RSI,B000JLIYRQ,Mr. H. C. Orr,"[5, 16]","Made towards the end of the Second World War, ""Kolberg"" is a great eample of how Nazi cinema never really recovered from the exodus of stellar directorial, acting and production personnel upon Hitler's ascent to power in 1933.Directed by the infamous Veit Harlan -who also helmed the vicious anti-semitic propaganda ""Jud Suss"" (1940)- ""Kolberg"" tells of the eponymous town valiant defence against Napoleon's army in 1806. The chilling overtones to the story clearly mark it as National Socialist propaganda.  For instance, the film labours the need of citizens to fight when they are threatened, and makes a triumph of the eventual accptance by Gneissenau that death is better than surrender.Unforunately, these are the most interesting elements of the film. Generally the direction is lacklustre, the large cast sparsely used, and the battles over too fleetingly to really make any claim to being a war epic. Heinrich George's performance is the stuff of steely resolve one would expect, but the romantic elements are not handled well either by Harlan or the actors (including the generic stoic Aryan character played by Kristina Soderbaum, who was also cast in the superior ""Ohm Kruger (1941)).Harlan's film only seems to spring into life when dealing with the wholesale destruction of Kolberg, filming the collapsing buildings with gusto. German audiences of the time knew all too well about destruction, but few ever saw the finished film, as it was released as the Nazis were on the verge of defeat. In reality, they didn't miss very much.",2,The Home Front,1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,1544,"['Made', 'towards', 'end', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Kolberg', 'great', 'eample', 'how', 'Nazi', 'cinema', 'never', 'really', 'recovered', 'exodus', 'stellar', 'directorial', 'acting', 'production', 'personnel', 'Hitler', 'ascent', 'power', '1933.Directed', 'infamous', 'Veit', 'Harlan', '-who', 'also', 'helmed', 'vicious', 'anti-semitic', 'propaganda', 'Jud', 'Suss', '1940', 'Kolberg', 'tells', 'eponymous', 'town', 'valiant', 'defence', 'Napoleon', 'army', '1806', 'chilling', 'overtones', 'story', 'clearly', 'mark', 'National', 'Socialist', 'propaganda', 'instance', 'film', 'need', 'citizens', 'fight', 'when', 'are', 'threatened', 'triumph', 'eventual', 'accptance', 'Gneissenau', 'death', 'better', 'surrender.Unforunately', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'elements', 'film', 'Generally', 'direction', 'lacklustre', 'large', 'cast', 'sparsely', 'used', 'battles', 'too', 'fleetingly', 'really', 'make', 'claim', 'being', 'war', 'epic', 'Heinrich', 'George', 'performance', 'stuff', 'steely', 'resolve', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'romantic', 'elements', 'are', 'not', 'handled', 'well', 'either', 'Harlan', 'actors', 'including', 'generic', 'stoic', 'Aryan', 'character', 'played', 'Kristina', 'Soderbaum', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'cast', 'superior', 'Ohm', 'Kruger', '1941', '.Harlan', 'film', 'only', 'spring', 'life', 'when', 'dealing', 'wholesale', 'destruction', 'Kolberg', 'filming', 'collapsing', 'buildings', 'gusto', 'German', 'audiences', 'time', 'knew', 'too', 'well', 'destruction', 'few', 'ever', 'saw', 'finished', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Nazis', 'were', 'verge', 'defeat', 'reality', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'very', 'much']",Kolberg: The Restored 1945 Epic

1027574,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,B000JLIYRQ,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[39, 41]","Kolberg comes under the notion of what I call classy propaganda.  Make no mistake, this film was a Nazi production. As such its interesting to see how they use history to make their point.  Kolberg was an actual town in what use to be East Prussia.  The film takes place just after the epic defeats of Jena-Auerstadt which saw the complete defeat of the old Prussian army by Napolean in October 1807.  There is a preamble dated later in 1813 in which Gneisenau, one of the great Prussian army reformers of the period has a spirited discussion with King Fredrich William III of Prussia.  The King is shown representing the elitest interests of Prussia, and is hesitant to declare a renewed war against Napolean who has just suffered his great defeat in Russia (1812).  Gneisenau argues that the King should lead his people, and rise the peasants as well as the nobility against the French.  F.W. III is relectant as he is more fearful of social unrest against established order, than of Napoleonic domination!  These were critical issues of the time in Prussia, which the movie uses as clever propaganda to urge the German viewers of 1945 to rise up in the same way and support the Nazis, i.e. Hitler!  This subtle distortion of German history makes for interesting play in the movie, which will use the same themes throughout.The scene then changes back to Kolberg in 1807 with a Prussia still reeling from recent defeats.  The town is issued an ultimatum by the French to surrender, as most of the other fortified towns of Prussia had already.  Nettlebeck, the burgermeister of the town urges resistance and forms a local defense to resist the French.  This goes against the local garrison commander, who in typical old Prussian army style would rather surrender to Napolean than see the common people resist against him.  The film portrays the clash between Nettlebeck and the old Prussian commander with obvious overtones of the Nazi's appeal to eliminate such class distinctions.  Interesting stuff.  This is a propaganda film with some interesting character development and social/historical issues.There is also reference to a Major Von Schill who rises to the defense of Kolberg as well.  Schill actually belongs to a slightly later period when Prussia thought of rising with Austria in 1809 when the later declared war against Napolean again. Many Prussian officers wanted F.W III to support Austria.  The king declined as he did not think the country ready to ally against the French.  Events were to prove him correct as Austria was crushed at Wagram in 1809, but the reverberations of these events in Prussia saw some like Major Von Schill take things into their own hands.  Schill was crushed by the French later that year, but the movie combines his actions with Kolberg.  Another historical inaccuracy, but interesting none the less.Eventually the film shows the arrogant French move against the heroic town of Kolberg.  Napolean and his marshalls are shown in amusing caricatures of galic arrogance!  Funny stuff.  Although there is one accurate scene which has Napolean visiting the tomb of Frederick The Great and claiming if he were still alive they would not be there.  Quite true, and L'emporeur actual did say that. Marshall Mortier, one of Napolean's relatively competant generals conducted the actual siege of the town.The battle scenes are a bit exaggerated as Kolberg suddenly seems to have legions of Prussian defenders to rain destruction down upon the French assault columes.  Again, this is slanted.  Portray the French as stupid and arrogant, the Prussians as noble and heroic!  Thats part of the fun of films like this, to see where the history becomes propaganda!  Still, the movie does not go too far off in comparison to more recent epics like Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"".Kolberg resists against the fire and storm of French bombardment and the obvious comparisons to the allied bombing of Germany at that time is apparent.There is an interesting scene showing a portrayal of the Queen of Prussia who is seen by the female heroine in the film.  The Queen, a celebrated beauty of the time, is shown as almost angelic!  What were the Nazi producers thinking here!  Napolean claimed her to be the only real man in Prussia at the time. Certainly she had more spirit than her weak husband.Towards the end the film mentions the Treaty of Tilsit which saw a peace concluded bwtween the three emperors, F.W III of Prussia, Tsar Alexander III of Russia and Napolean.  Kolberg is still shown repulsing every French effort to take it, until suddenly the French decide to simply stop attacking because of the terms of the treaty.  This comes across as a miracle in the film, and no doubt the German audiance of the time was intended to see it that way.  By 1945 Nazi Germany needed a miracle in order to survive!The film pays no attention to the fact that in 1807 the Tsar of Russia came to the assistence of Prussia, and fought two bloody battles at Eylau and Friedland against Napolean.  Nazi propaganda would not like to portray the Russians as helpful in any way!Kolberg is an unususal work.  It combines history with propaganda in interesting way.  We know this is a Nazi production, yet there is a surprising amount of subtlety here.  Cinema students of propaganda can get a lot out of this film, but it is also worthwhile to those interested in the period it portrays, as well as the techniques of the film itself.  The DVD could use a documentry to explain a lot of these issues, and to describe the major efforts that were made to pruduce it.  Troops and material were used to make this film, which certainly were needed elsewhere!  Kolberg can be seen in several different ways.  As Nazi propaganda, as heroic resistance against tyranny (a bit ironic) and as just a good 1940s era foreign film.  Anyway the viewer wishes to see the film, they should find it worthwhile.",4,"Kolberg, Classy Propaganda",1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,5900,"['Kolberg', 'notion', 'what', 'call', 'classy',
