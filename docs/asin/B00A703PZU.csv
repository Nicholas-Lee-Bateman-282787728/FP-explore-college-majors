1606135,A2S85GBJBOT8MW,B00A703PZU,American,"[2, 2]","This movie was pretty good.  It is about a team of 6 Korean explorers going to the Point Of Inaccessibility in Antarctica. One question I had through the movie, if it is so inaccessible why is there so much debris from previous groups in the area?  I can understand the debris from the British expedition but why the fishing camp or whatever it was?  Also why the marker over the spot of the POI?  How many expeditions had already been there?  I did like that you never were sure what was reality and what was the past seeping through.  And that the Koreans were never able to really deviate from the trail of the British.  I did wonder how they went from having only 1 week worth of food to having enough for 3.  Overall it was a good movie and I do recommend it.",4,Pretty Good Thriller/Horror,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,764,"['movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'team', '6', 'Korean', 'explorers', 'going', 'Point', 'Inaccessibility', 'Antarctica', 'One', 'question', 'had', 'movie', 'so', 'inaccessible', 'why', 'there', 'so', 'much', 'debris', 'previous', 'groups', 'area', 'can', 'understand', 'debris', 'British', 'expedition', 'why', 'fishing', 'camp', 'whatever', 'was', 'Also', 'why', 'marker', 'spot', 'POI', 'How', 'many', 'expeditions', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'there', 'did', 'like', 'never', 'were', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'reality', 'was', 'past', 'seeping', 'Koreans', 'were', 'never', 'able', 'really', 'deviate', 'trail', 'British', 'did', 'wonder', 'how', 'went', 'having', 'only', '1', 'week', 'worth', 'food', 'having', 'enough', '3', 'Overall', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'do', 'recommend']",Antarctic Journal
1606136,A36W7A0PHT4Q2J,B00A703PZU,B. Elazier,"[2, 2]",I liked Antartic Journal. The movie is a very creepy and suspenseful Korean horror flick. Six Korean explores go on an expediition in Antartica. But the team finds a journal and a dead body from a British expedition back in 1922. And things just get creepier from there for the team of explores.,4,I liked it.,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,295,"['liked', 'Antartic', 'Journal', 'movie', 'very', 'creepy', 'suspenseful', 'Korean', 'horror', 'flick', 'Six', 'Korean', 'explores', 'go', 'expediition', 'Antartica', 'team', 'journal', 'dead', 'body', 'British', 'expedition', 'back', '1922', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'creepier', 'team', 'explores']",Antarctic Journal

I review these things to let you know whether you might like the film m,or not, not to be erudite.Maybe a Korean audience would know what this was about, but I have no freaking idea. It didn't know what it wanted to be: adventure, man against the odds, ghost film or what. It was surreal and over the top as six men try to march to some fictitious point called the P.O.I. I mean---they could have just choppered there, so it's a phony expedition to begin with. And when they start dying one by one, I mean, like, it's time to use the sat-link to call in the rescue party, like Bear and Les' do on TV.But the &#34;captain&#34; keeps driving his men onward into death, and they follow, against all reason and intelligence. Maybe this fictitious point at the Antarctic requires some special &#34;bushido&#34; from men, not just flying down to it, I don't know. But something special is supposed to happen when they get there.I did not get the plot; I did not get the ending; I was not interested or entertained. I feel I wasted my time and could have been watching a good Bollywood comedy or a Jap/Chinese period piece.Korean film is not good at this sort of story. It was more Jap/Chinese. Koreans are great at comedy, period pieces, and mobster stuff, but this was just too philosophical and obscure for me to enjoy or be innerested in---I mean, I don't want to work THAT hard to get the point.Also, the cgi (men plodding across trackless wasteland) and green screen (dark skies, caverns, etc.) stuff didn't work for me and was just irritating.Give it a miss, is what I advise :)Sorry..",2,I don't quite know what to say about this film other than give it a miss.,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,1699,"['do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'desire', 'dissect', 'film', 'review', 'things', 'let', 'know', 'might', 'like', 'film', 'm', 'not', 'not', 'be', 'erudite.Maybe', 'Korean', 'audience', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'have', 'freaking', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'adventure', 'man', 'odds', 'ghost', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'surreal', 'top', 'six', 'men', 'try', 'march', 'fictitious', 'point', 'called', 'P.O.I', 'mean', '-they', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'choppered', 'there', 'phony', 'expedition', 'begin', 'when', 'start', 'dying', 'one', 'one', 'mean', 'time', 'use', 'sat-link', 'call', 'rescue', 'party', 'Bear', 'Les', 'do', 'TV.But', '34', 'captain', '34', 'keeps', 'driving', 'men', 'onward', 'death', 'follow', 'reason', 'intelligence', 'Maybe', 'fictitious', 'point', 'Antarctic', 'special', '34', 'bushido', '34', 'men', 'not', 'just', 'flying', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'something', 'special', 'supposed', 'happen', 'when', 'get', 'there.I', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'plot', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'interested', 'entertained', 'feel', 'wasted', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'good', 'Bollywood', 'comedy', 'Jap/Chinese', 'period', 'piece.Korean', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'sort', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'Jap/Chinese', 'Koreans', 'are', 'great', 'comedy', 'period', 'pieces', 'mobster', 'stuff', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'philosophical', 'obscure', 'enjoy', 'be', 'innerested', '-I', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'work', 'THAT', 'get', 'point.Also', 'cgi', 'men', 'plodding', 'trackless', 'wasteland', 'green', 'screen', 'dark', 'skies', 'caverns', 'etc', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'just', 'irritating.Give', 'miss', 'what', 'advise', 'Sorry..']",Antarctic Journal
