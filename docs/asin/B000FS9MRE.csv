I missed the concert they had in June(Philly area),so I really had to buy this.This DVD is all music,no talking, interviews etc.The way they adapt ELP's keyboard dominated music to guitar works really well most of the time.The bass player is very good doing everything from Emerson's keyboard runs to double leads with the guitar player.The only negative I have is with the camera work. They should show Carl more.At the end of Tarkus they should be showing Carl,not back and forth to the guitar an bass player.This is only a minor complaint,because this is a whole concert,mistakes and all.If you like Carl you should check it out.A great buy.",5,"Carl, You're still the Man !",1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,693,"['Being', 'huge', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'fan', 'had', 'buy', 'missed', 'concert', 'had', 'June', 'Philly', 'area', 'so', 'really', 'had', 'buy', 'this.This', 'DVD', 'music', 'talking', 'interviews', 'etc.The', 'way', 'adapt', 'ELP', 'keyboard', 'dominated', 'music', 'guitar', 'works', 'really', 'well', 'most', 'time.The', 'bass', 'player', 'very', 'good', 'doing', 'everything', 'Emerson', 'keyboard', 'double', 'leads', 'guitar', 'only', 'negative', 'have', 'camera', 'work', 'should', 'show', 'Carl', 'more.At', 'end', 'Tarkus', 'should', 'be', 'showing', 'Carl', 'not', 'back', 'forth', 'guitar', 'bass', 'player.This', 'only', 'minor', 'complaint', 'whole', 'concert', 'mistakes', 'all.If', 'Carl', 'should', 'check', 'out.A', 'great', 'buy']",N/A

You have the always-excellent Carl on drums, a great bass player who is laying everything down perfectly, and a young guitar player who is simply amazing.  Together, these guys play every type of music - heavy, prog, fusion, precision, etc, and they're playing the songs of ELP, no less.  I got this last month, and I still can't get it out of my DVD player.  These guys rock, and you can definitely crank this DVD.  It doesn't come in 5.1 sound, but I'm okay with that - I can still crank the music up in stereo just like I used to do when I was in high school (before 5.1 was invented!).

994902,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B000FS9MRE,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[10, 15]","This DVD performance features the 54 year old Carl Palmer and a bass guitarist and a lead guitarist that probably weren't even born until the eighties when ELP had already broken up and departed from each other for more than 15 years.  Keith Emerson and Greg Lake got together again in 1986, but Carl was with Asia during that time.Anyway, the two young guitarists performing with Carl were pretty good but the whole concept of Carl Palmer trying to simulate the classics of ELP with these two kids appears to be kind of like a desparate attempt to stay in the spotlight of today's paying audience.Carl Palmer was even less of the Carl Palmer that we ELP fans have grow fond of over the years. First of all, the gongs were gone.  And for the lack of vocals, this show wasn't fully well-rounded. The backbone and depth of ELP's music was rather bleak.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it's just so extremely limited for a legend like Carl Palmer to be doing these days to stay alive in the music world.  Realistically, I think these guys performing together doing all new material, and NOT ELP material, would have been a better, more glorifying show.  Carl should have considered that.As for the DVD itself:  The sound quality is 2.0 stereo.  No better than any 1980's video sound recording, however, the video quality is the lowest quality one could imagine for a fairly recent filming.  This show was filmed in 2004, but the picture quality looks equal to DVD released concerts filmed like in 1978 or thereabouts.  It's not an extreme eyesore, but I sure expected something better than this for this recently filmed show.But, it is worth watching once, anyway.  The two young guitarists did do pretty good for what couldn't help but be a limitation beyond their control.But, don't let me discourage you.  Please check it out for yourself.",3,"It's worth renting once, but I won't bother buying this",1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,1842,"['DVD', 'performance', '54', 'year', 'old', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'bass', 'guitarist', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'probably', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'born', 'eighties', 'when', 'ELP', 'had', 'already', 'broken', 'up', 'departed', 'other', 'more', '15', 'years', 'Keith', 'Emerson', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'got', 'together', 'again', '1986', 'Carl', 'was', 'Asia', 'time.Anyway', 'two', 'young', 'guitarists', 'performing', 'Carl', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'whole', 'concept', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'trying', 'simulate', 'classics', 'ELP', 'two', 'kids', 'be', 'kind', 'desparate', 'attempt', 'stay', 'spotlight', 'today', 'paying', 'audience.Carl', 'Palmer', 'was', 'even', 'less', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'ELP', 'fans', 'have', 'grow', 'fond', 'years', 'First', 'all', 'gongs', 'were', 'gone', 'lack', 'vocals', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'well-rounded', 'backbone', 'depth', 'ELP', 'music', 'was', 'rather', 'bleak', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'so', 'extremely', 'limited', 'legend', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'be', 'doing', 'days', 'stay', 'alive', 'music', 'world', 'Realistically', 'think', 'guys', 'performing', 'together', 'doing', 'new', 'material', 'NOT', 'ELP', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'glorifying', 'show', 'Carl', 'should', 'have', 'considered', 'that.As', 'DVD', 'sound', 'quality', '2.0', 'stereo', 'No', 'better', '1980', 'video', 'sound', 'recording', 'however', 'video', 'quality', 'lowest', 'quality', 'one', 'could', 'imagine', 'fairly', 'recent', 'filming', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', '2004', 'picture', 'quality', 'equal', 'DVD', 'released', 'concerts', 'filmed', '1978', 'thereabouts', 'not', 'extreme', 'eyesore', 'sure', 'expected', 'something', 'better', 'recently', 'filmed', 'show.But', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'anyway', 'two', 'young', 'guitarists', 'did', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'limitation', 'control.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'discourage', 'Please', 'check', 'out']",N/A
994903,A2792QUVUEP74U,B000FS9MRE,Shred,"[8, 11]","If you ever wanted to know what ELP music sounded with a wild electric guitarist in a power trio format this is the disc to buy. Carl Palmer's put together an excellent 3 piece band and the arrangements of ELP music in this format are interesting and entertaining.Palmer is as usual just an amazing drummer and nothing more need be said about that.The bass player, Dave Marks, is just amazing. He is an 8 string player who not only plays Greg Lakes bass parts but also takes on parts of Emerson's keyboards as well. His solo, thoughtfully using digital delays to layer on multiple tracks is just amazing. He is simply stellar throughout the show.The young guitar player, Paul Bielatowicz, is also amazing. I'll give this kid a lot of credit. He had to pull off Keith Emerson's multiple parts, with multiple keyboards with only a guitar. In the mad tapping style of Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and John Pettruchi this kid did a great job.However I do have some criticisms. I thought his guitar sound got a bit grating after a while. I understand he had to cut through the din and cover Keith's parts but . . .Look kid, if yer gonna try to emulate Satriani, Vai and JP, then you need to put away that Paul Reed Smith guitar and pick up a super shredder like an Ibanez. As a guitar player myself I know there's a reason those guys, and myself, play an Ibanez. It has the tone, the neck, the large frets you need to have that insane speed, and sharp but fat tone that you really need to tap and shred.A PRS is a great guitar but it's a bit more like a Les Paul and you simply can't handle it as well for that type of music.  Maybe only shredder guitarists will know what I mean here. Another annoying thing was his tone. It was the same treble/bridge pickup, with the same cheap mode of distortion thoughout 95% of the show and it really got grating.Kid, ... flip that pickup switch and try playing with the neck pickup to get a fatter sound and change up your tone a bit!If you notice a lot of the time Steve Morse will play just the opposite of most players and play his rhythm parts with the bridge pickup, and his solos with the neck to give then a fatter, more ballsy tone.I know some will think this is silly criticism, but his thin, cheap distortion tone really got on my nerves after a while.  Anyone else notice that?I wanted to reach through the screen and smash that guitar, and his effects pedals to bits as I thought that guitar slowed his maniacal playing down, and gave him a constant grating tone.Oh, and by the way there are a couple of spots where the tape editors must have been toking it up because the sound and the pic are just slightly out of sync.Another MAJOR complaint is they advertise this as having the song ""Trilogy"". Well, it's there, during the blackened out rolling of the credits for just a few seconds. It sounds like an excellent version of the song, maybe the highlight of the entire show, and I felt ripped off that it really wasn't included on the disc as a performance.  That REALLY got me angry!This disc loses a star, or at least half a one, for those ""flaws"".Other than that I thought that the band was great and that this was a really interesting disc.This disc is definitely worth having and Carl Palmer shows why he is simply one of the best drummers in the universe.",4,Carl Palmer is the worlds best drummer!,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,3306,"['ever', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'ELP', 'music', 'sounded', 'wild', 'electric', 'guitarist', 'power', 'trio', 'format', 'disc', 'buy', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'put', 'together', 'excellent', '3', 'piece', 'band', 'arrangements', 'ELP', 'music', 'format', 'are', 'interesting', 'entertaining.Palmer', 'as', 'usual', 'just', 'amazing', 'drummer', 'nothing', 'more', 'need', 'be', 'said', 'that.The', 'bass', 'player', 'Dave', 'Marks', 'just', 'amazing', '8', 'string', 'player', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'Greg', 'Lakes', 'bass', 'parts', 'also', 'parts', 'Emerson', 'keyboards', 'well', 'solo', 'thoughtfully', 'using', 'digital', 'delays', 'layer', 'multiple', 'tracks', 'just', 'amazing', 'simply', 'stellar', 'show.The', 'young', 'guitar', 'player', 'Paul', 'Bielatowicz', 'also', 'amazing', ""'ll"", 'give', 'kid', 'lot', 'credit', 'had', 'pull', 'off', 'Keith', 'Emerson', 'multiple', 'parts', 'multiple', 'keyboards', 'only', 'guitar', 'mad', 'tapping', 'style', 'Joe', 'Satriani', 'Steve', 'Vai', 'John', 'Pettruchi', 'kid', 'did', 'great', 'job.However', 'do', 'have', 'criticisms', 'thought', 'guitar', 'sound', 'got', 'bit', 'grating', 'while', 'understand', 'had', 'cut', 'din', 'cover', 'Keith', 'parts', '.Look', 'kid', 'yer', 'gon', 'try', 'emulate', 'Satriani', 'Vai', 'JP', 'then', 'need', 'put', 'away', 'Paul', 'Reed', 'Smith', 'guitar', 'pick', 'up', 'super', 'shredder', 'Ibanez', 'guitar', 'player', 'know', 'reason', 'guys', 'play', 'Ibanez', 'tone', 'neck', 'large', 'frets', 'need', 'have', 'insane', 'speed', 'sharp', 'fat', 'tone', 'really', 'need', 'tap', 'shred.A', 'PRS', 'great', 'guitar', 'bit', 'more', 'Les', 'Paul', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'as', 'well', 'type', 'music', 'Maybe', 'only', 'shredder', 'guitarists', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'here', 'annoying', 'thing', 'was', 'tone', 'was', 'same', 'treble/bridge', 'pickup', 'same', 'cheap', 'mode', 'distortion', '95', '%', 'show', 'really', 'got', 'grating.Kid', 'flip', 'pickup', 'switch', 'try', 'playing', 'neck', 'pickup', 'get', 'fatter', 'sound', 'change', 'up', 'tone', 'bit', 'notice', 'lot', 'time', 'Steve', 'Morse', 'will', 'play', 'just', 'opposite', 'most', 'players', 'play', 'rhythm', 'parts', 'bridge', 'pickup', 'solos', 'neck', 'give', 'then', 'fatter', 'more', 'ballsy', 'tone.I', 'know', 'will', 'think', 'silly', 'criticism', 'thin', 'cheap', 'distortion', 'tone', 'really', 'got', 'nerves', 'while', 'Anyone', 'else', 'notice', 'wanted', 'reach', 'screen', 'smash', 'guitar', 'effects', 'pedals', 'bits', 'thought', 'guitar', 'slowed', 'maniacal', 'playing', 'down', 'gave', 'constant', 'grating', 'tone.Oh', 'way', 'are', 'couple', 'spots', 'where', 'tape', 'editors', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'toking', 'up', 'sound', 'pic', 'are', 'just', 'slightly', 'sync.Another', 'MAJOR', 'complaint', 'advertise', 'having', 'song', 'Trilogy', 'Well', 'there', 'blackened', 'out', 'rolling', 'credits', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'excellent', 'version', 'song', 'maybe', 'highlight', 'entire', 'show', 'felt', 'ripped', 'off', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'disc', 'performance', 'REALLY', 'got', 'angry', 'disc', 'star', 'least', 'one', 'flaws', '.Other', 'thought', 'band', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'disc.This', 'disc', 'definitely', 'worth', 'having', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'why', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'drummers', 'universe']",N/A

Davis ""tmdavis21""","[1, 1]","I'm 56 and fairly picky.I always wondered what this music would sound like done with a guitar, but when I heard this guitarist compared to Satriani and Vai.  I held off.  I tire of that kind of guitar playing real fast.  But this guitar player and bass player ARE ""Very Musical""  This is real music.  I like some of this better than ELP.  It's more understandable to me anyways.  I happen to like the sound.  I'm not really an Ibanez/Demarzio type guy.  Vai and those guys are good players but just because this guy taps I wouldn't put them in the same catagorie. Paul's tapping is not a hokey crescendo thang but applied as the music calls for it.  This guy I can listen too.  I buy prog and jazz guitar DVD mostly.I don't compare these guys to ELP.  There is no point.  This is a different format doing some excellently written music. This interpretation is great.  These guys will stand up in any arena.  Paul's sound is classic mixed with modern technique.  That makes him unigue folks.  He doesn't use a bunch of effects, in fact barely none at all.  These guys are NOT trying to emulate ELP.  This is music.  It's not Palmer making dough.These guys also smile and arn't afraid of the audience.  This is a DVD after all.
