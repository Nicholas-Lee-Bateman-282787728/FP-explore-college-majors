221887,A4MQ75RMLWTS4,6300216543,A. Bouardi,"[23, 24]","The story of Frank Serpico, an honest Nyc cop, is one of the most compelling police movies ever made.  Al Pacino gives the character a lot of class and cool.  Serpico is an easy-going guy with very clear morals about what's right and what's wrong.  As he moves from precinct to precinct in dire hope of finding an honest place to work, all he finds are more and more corrupt cops...and it seems to be driving him insane both morally, and insane because the cops aren't comfortable with cops who don't take money.  The film does a great job of displaying how the corruption is corrosive and unjust to the people of our country...but esp. interesting is that this wonderfully directed Sidney Lumet film is really very much like a suspense adventure chase...but at a much slower speed in which you can watch as things crumble and go to pot.  Pacino plays the role in an understated manner...perhaps due to his knowledge of the real Frank Serpico, or maybe a creative choice.  Either way, it's not his usual boisterous way...no crooked looks, no playful grins, etc.  You'll forget Pacino is in this character.  That Academy is worthless for not handing out an Oscar for this or Scarface or for Godfather I or II...or Dog Day Afternoon or Glengarry Glen Ross.",5,Very compelling story.,997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,1254,"['story', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'honest', 'Nyc', 'cop', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'police', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'character', 'lot', 'class', 'cool', 'Serpico', 'easy-going', 'guy', 'very', 'clear', 'morals', 'what', 'right', 'what', 'wrong', 'precinct', 'precinct', 'dire', 'hope', 'finding', 'honest', 'place', 'work', 'are', 'more', 'more', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'be', 'driving', 'insane', 'morally', 'insane', 'cops', 'are', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'cops', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'money', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'displaying', 'how', 'corruption', 'corrosive', 'unjust', 'people', 'country', 'esp', 'interesting', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'film', 'really', 'very', 'much', 'suspense', 'adventure', 'chase', 'much', 'slower', 'speed', 'can', 'watch', 'things', 'crumble', 'go', 'pot', 'Pacino', 'role', 'understated', 'manner', 'perhaps', 'due', 'knowledge', 'real', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'maybe', 'creative', 'choice', 'way', 'not', 'usual', 'boisterous', 'way', 'crooked', 'looks', 'playful', 'grins', 'etc', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'Pacino', 'character', 'Academy', 'worthless', 'not', 'handing', 'out', 'Oscar', 'Scarface', 'Godfather', 'II', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross']",Serpico VHS
221888,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300216543,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Serpico, 1973 filmThe opening lists the names of the people who worked on this film, adapted from the Peter Maas book. The first scenes show a wounded Serpico being sped to a hospital. Serpico thinks back to his beginning as a policeman. He will be tested as to his character while fighting crime. Serpico is taught how the system works while he is on the job. An arrested rapist is encouraged to inform on his playmates; Serpico uses diplomacy and learns more. Serpico joins the Identification Division to advance his career. Serpico gets the label of ""weirdo"" and hangs out with artists (or beatniks?). Serpico's grooming allow him to be well disguised. He learns that who you know is important (as in other fields of work).The story continues and shows Serpico's experiences at work in New York City. His police partners work hard at their job. Serpico works undercover. He trusts his handler; but is his trust misplaced? The political reality is that the system exists with the knowledge and tolerance of the rulers. [This is another example of the feudal system, as in politics; those who swear fealty to the ruler are always rewarded.]The Commissioner tells the police brass to go ahead and investigate corruption. But rumors about Serpico abound among the police. Serpico will talk, but he won't testify against the other policemen. He is warned about what can happen if the force is not with him. [Can any institution be reformed from within?]The 'NY Times' prints a front-page story, and the Whitman-Knapp Commission starts to investigate. Serpico is transferred to Brooklyn South to work on drug dealers; this could be dangerous. Then a drug bust goes wrong and Serpico is shot. His gold shield (#761) came through (he is now a first-grade detective). But the wound damages his hearing in his left ear and affects his left side. The film ends by showing Serpico making a speech. But what has really changed since then? There are parts in this film that suggest it was oriented to a foreign audience. The film suggests no answers to the recurring problem of big city corruption. Would placing the police in the Civil Service system prevent corruption? Does it work with other government agencies? Or is corruption inherent in our civilization, like human error?",4,"Corruption in New York, Again",1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,2270,"['Serpico', '1973', 'filmThe', 'opening', 'names', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'film', 'adapted', 'Peter', 'Maas', 'book', 'first', 'scenes', 'show', 'wounded', 'Serpico', 'being', 'sped', 'hospital', 'Serpico', 'back', 'beginning', 'policeman', 'will', 'be', 'tested', 'character', 'fighting', 'crime', 'Serpico', 'taught', 'how', 'system', 'job', 'arrested', 'rapist', 'encouraged', 'inform', 'playmates', 'Serpico', 'diplomacy', 'more', 'Serpico', 'Identification', 'Division', 'advance', 'career', 'Serpico', 'label', 'weirdo', 'out', 'artists', 'beatniks', 'Serpico', 'grooming', 'allow', 'be', 'well', 'disguised', 'who', 'know', 'important', 'other', 'fields', 'work', 'story', 'Serpico', 'experiences', 'work', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'police', 'partners', 'work', 'hard', 'job', 'Serpico', 'undercover', 'handler', 'trust', 'misplaced', 'political', 'reality', 'system', 'knowledge', 'tolerance', 'rulers', '[', 'example', 'feudal', 'system', 'politics', 'who', 'swear', 'fealty', 'ruler', 'are', 'always', 'rewarded', ']', 'Commissioner', 'police', 'brass', 'go', 'ahead', 'investigate', 'corruption', 'rumors', 'Serpico', 'abound', 'police', 'Serpico', 'will', 'talk', 'wo', ""n't"", 'testify', 'other', 'policemen', 'warned', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'force', 'not', '[', 'Can', 'institution', 'be', 'reformed', ']', ""'NY"", 'Times', 'prints', 'front-page', 'story', 'Whitman-Knapp', 'Commission', 'investigate', 'Serpico', 'transferred', 'Brooklyn', 'South', 'work', 'drug', 'dealers', 'could', 'be', 'dangerous', 'Then', 'drug', 'bust', 'wrong', 'Serpico', 'shot', 'gold', 'shield', '761', 'came', 'now', 'first-grade', 'detective', 'wound', 'damages', 'hearing', 'left', 'ear', 'left', 'side', 'film', 'ends', 'showing', 'Serpico', 'making', 'speech', 'what', 'really', 'changed', 'then', 'are', 'parts', 'film', 'suggest', 'was', 'oriented', 'foreign', 'audience', 'film', 'answers', 'recurring', 'problem', 'big', 'city', 'corruption', 'Would', 'placing', 'police', 'Civil', 'Service', 'system', 'prevent', 'corruption', 'work', 'other', 'government', 'agencies', 'corruption', 'inherent', 'civilization', 'human', 'error']",Serpico VHS

Pacino gets completely into the role...he becomes Serpico, an honest open-minded hippy cop in the '60s pitted against his corrupt disgusting colleagues and the higher ups who not only allow the corruption, but (as the film hints at) conspire to crush those who try to expose it.You must see this film uncut, as many of us saw it only on TV with much of the intensity cut out.  Of course the film adds some extra drama to it not in the actual Peter Maas biography, just as Alan Parker did in Midnight Express.Some tidbits:  They actually had a year long TV series Serpico in 1975.  And watch for the newly finished World Trade Center in the background (during the actual events it wasn't yet finished...not nitpicking...just something of interest).Finally this is Al Pacino's definitive performance, in my opinion a superior role and film to The Godfather.

221890,A2HUU0YW6HNNQE,6300216543,"A.F. ""musicfan585""","[4, 4]","Out of all the performances he did in the 1970s, Al Pacino's amazing, realistic performance in Sidney Lumet's 1973 film SERPICO is by far his most underrated.  Even though the movie was a success and critics praise this as one of Pacino's best roles (I would agree to that), SERPICO was sandwiched in between the two GODFATHER movies which contained Pacino's most famous role of Michael Corleone.  It seems that some have forgotten this film, but luckily I read about it recently and now have discovered how great this movie really is.  It was also a groundbreaking motion picture - the first movie ever to expose police corruption among the NYC departments.  Corruption was known to exist in police departments, but it remained largely underground and unknown to the public.  When the original book was published followed by the film version which became SERPICO, it exposed the public to a hidden evil that was lurking right under their noses and how one honest cop tried to change all that for good.The film is based on a true story, on the life of Frank Serpico (Pacino).  It begins in the late '60s and ends in 1972, during Serpico's five-year ordeal as a NYC undercover cop.  When we first see Frank in his younger years, graduating from training, he's an idealistic man who wants to help people.  It's clear from the start that Serpico is not your average policeman: he is honest, a do-gooder, wants to help people, by-the-book, and his facial and top hair are extravagant.  He hates wearing the uniform and becomes a part of the plainclothes division.  As time rolls on, Serpico notices that various police officers are taking money from criminals as well as bribes, and also beat the criminals mercilessly.  It's all drug money or the like, and Serpico wants no part of it.  Throughout the movie, he constantly ignores the copious bribes offered to him by his peers.  Thus, Serpico hops from precinct to precinct hoping to work with honest cops, but it turns out that every precinct in the city is even worse than the last one.  Frank wants to expose this police corruption, but his so-called ""friends"" give him false promises and drive him towards frustration.  He begins to snap, it damages his relationships, and when he says that he is all alone in this case, you can't help but believe him.Serpico's story is not a triumphant one.  For all the good he tried to do and for all the effort he tried to do to put an end to rampant corruption, he is constantly spit on for his actions.  Pacino really gives an effective performance throughout.  He starts off as a nice, humble guy who wants to do the right thing at the beginning, and by the end the right thing almost causes him to lose his life.  This is a really great showcase for Pacino's talent.  Sidney Lumet directs the film with gritty expertise.  You really feel like you're there in New York circa 1970 and it just adds to the painful, grim realism of the film.  The special features on the DVD are also good, the best of which is a short but rewarding two-part documentary on the making of the film.SERPICO is a towering achievement.  It deserves more credit that it gets.  Here is a movie that features one of our greatest actors in prime form and a wrenching story told the way the real Frank Serpico would've wanted it: honest.",5,One Man vs. Citywide Corruption,1055721600,"06 16, 2003",2003,3301,"['performances', 'did', '1970s', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'amazing', 'realistic', 'performance', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', '1973', 'film', 'SERPICO', 'far', 'most', 'underrated', 'Even', 'movie', 'was', 'success', 'critics', 'praise', 'one', 'Pacino', 'best', 'roles', 'would', 'agree', 'SERPICO', 'was', 'sandwiched', 'two', 'GODFATHER', 'movies', 'contained', 'Pacino', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'have', 'forgotten', 'film', 'luckily', 'read', 'recently', 'now', 'have', 'discovered', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'also', 'groundbreaking', 'motion', 'picture', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'expose', 'police', 'corruption', 'NYC', 'departments', 'Corruption', 'was', 'known', 'exist', 'police', 'departments', 'remained', 'largely', 'underground', 'unknown', 'public', 'When', 'original', 'book', 'was', 'published', 'followed', 'film', 'version', 'became', 'SERPICO', 'exposed', 'public', 'hidden', 'evil', 'was', 'lurking', 'right', 'noses', 'how', 'one', 'honest', 'cop', 'tried', 'change', 'good.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'life', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'Pacino', 'late', ""'60s"", '1972', 'Serpico', 'five-year', 'ordeal', 'NYC', 'undercover', 'cop', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'Frank', 'younger', 'years', 'graduating', 'training', 'idealistic', 'man', 'who', 'help', 'people', 'clear', 'start', 'Serpico', 'not', 'average', 'policeman', 'honest', 'do-gooder', 'help', 'people', 'by-the-book', 'facial', 'top', 'hair', 'are', 'extravagant', 'wearing', 'uniform', 'part', 'plainclothes', 'division', 'time', 'rolls', 'Serpico', 'various', 'police', 'officers', 'are', 'taking', 'money', 'criminals', 'as', 'well', 'bribes', 'also', 'beat', 'criminals', 'mercilessly', 'drug', 'money', 'like', 'Serpico', 'part', 'movie', 'constantly', 'copious', 'bribes', 'offered', 'peers', 'Thus', 'Serpico', 'precinct', 'precinct', 'hoping', 'work', 'honest', 'cops', 'out', 'precinct', 'city', 'even', 'worse', 'last', 'one', 'Frank', 'expose', 'police', 'corruption', 'so-called', 'friends', 'give', 'false', 'promises', 'drive', 'frustration', 'snap', 'damages', 'relationships', 'when', 'alone', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'believe', 'him.Serpico', 'story', 'not', 'triumphant', 'one', 'good', 'tried', 'do', 'effort', 'tried', 'do', 'put', 'end', 'rampant', 'corruption', 'constantly', 'spit', 'actions', 'Pacino', 'really', 'effective', 'performance', 'off', 'nice', 'humble', 'guy', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'beginning', 'end', 'right', 'thing', 'almost', 'lose', 'life', 'really', 'great', 'showcase', 'Pacino', 'talent', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'film', 'gritty', 'expertise', 'really', 'feel', ""'re"", 'New', 'York', 'circa', '1970', 'just', 'painful', 'grim', 'realism', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'best', 'short', 'rewarding', 'two-part', 'documentary', 'making', 'film.SERPICO', 'towering', 'achievement', 'more', 'credit', 'Here', 'movie', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'prime', 'form', 'wrenching', 'story', 'told', 'way', 'real', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'would', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'honest']",Serpico VHS

Al Pacino's Performance as Serpico is one of the best in his career, he plays it so cool and professional that it's easy to forget that back in 1973 he was still at the beginning of his career. He makes character of Frank Serpico unforgettable. The film itself is very credible and honest with no clich&eacute;s that are often appear in this kind of genre.

221892,A9Z4C6SSRUL0E,6300216543,A. Liu,"[4, 5]","Before anyone who is expecting a good old-fashioned Good Cop V.S. Bad Asses action thriller, hold your horses. Although it is unlikely that anyone who really enjoys a piece of fine motion picture should be disappointed by ""Serpico"", there are no nature-defying stunts, bloodthirsty lengthy shoot-out, or high-speed downtonw car chase. All you will get, is a near-perfect blend of gripping story (based on true event), mesmerizing performances, and skillful yet subtle and minimal directing. ""Serpico"" is not a story about a supercop on his way to solve a gruesome crime done by some twisted psychopath, with extreme force or genius instincts. Yes, ""Serpico"" is a courageous and heroic figure, but he is also as down to earth as your next door neighbor painting his house. This is about a personal struggle, a tough test on a individual's hope, faith, and moral. While this movie may not be described as an epic masterpiece, it is indeed a milestone in cinematic achievements.By this DVD, Paramount did a great job preserving this film that made Al Pacino being reconized as one of the finest actor in our era. The picture is sharp and clean, though at time the colors may seem muddy. The 5.1 Dolby Digital is as good as you could expect from a sound track remastered from it's mono original. Whileas it may not give your surround system a good workout, it does provide a better dimension to some of the much-needed ambience.For extra, ""Serpico: from Real to Reel"" is a short documentary about the birth of this movie, and ""Inside Serpico"" is a longer behind-the-scenes featurette which reveals more lights from the history, production, and the public reaction upon its release back in 1973. Most part of these documentaries conisists largely of newly-filmed interview clips with producer Martin Bregman and director Sidney Lumet. To top it off, there is also a 2 minutes, yet somehow redundant ""Serpico: Favorite Moments"" interview clips with Bregman and Lumet each talking about their favorite part of the movie. All these could be string together to be a more fluent featurette, but I guess by seperating them this way, they could make the Special Features resume looks more impressive.There is also a Photo Gallery and a Original Trailor available.",5,The reason they make films in the beginning...,1040688000,"12 24, 2002",2002,2251,"['anyone', 'who', 'expecting', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'Good', 'Cop', 'V.S', 'Bad', 'Asses', 'action', 'thriller', 'hold', 'horses', 'unlikely', 'anyone', 'who', 'really', 'piece', 'fine', 'motion', 'picture', 'should', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Serpico', 'are', 'nature-defying', 'stunts', 'bloodthirsty', 'lengthy', 'shoot-out', 'high-speed', 'downtonw', 'car', 'chase', 'will', 'get', 'near-perfect', 'blend', 'gripping', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'event', 'mesmerizing', 'performances', 'skillful', 'yet', 'subtle', 'minimal', 'directing', 'Serpico', 'not', 'story', 'supercop', 'way', 'solve', 'gruesome', 'crime', 'done', 'twisted', 'psychopath', 'extreme', 'force', 'genius', 'instincts', 'Yes', 'Serpico', 'courageous', 'heroic', 'figure', 'also', 'as', 'down', 'earth', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'painting', 'house', 'personal', 'struggle', 'tough', 'test', 'individual', 'hope', 'faith', 'moral', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'described', 'epic', 'masterpiece', 'indeed', 'milestone', 'cinematic', 'achievements.By', 'DVD', 'Paramount', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'preserving', 'film', 'made', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'being', 'reconized', 'one', 'finest', 'actor', 'era', 'picture', 'sharp', 'clean', 'though', 'time', 'colors', 'may', 'seem', 'muddy', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'expect', 'sound', 'track', 'remastered', 'mono', 'original', 'may', 'not', 'give', 'surround', 'system', 'good', 'workout', 'provide', 'better', 'dimension', 'much-needed', 'ambience.For', 'extra', 'Serpico', 'Real', 'Reel', 'short', 'documentary', 'birth', 'movie', 'Inside', 'Serpico', 'longer', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'more', 'lights', 'history', 'production', 'public', 'reaction', 'release', 'back', '1973', 'Most', 'part', 'documentaries', 'largely', 'newly-filmed', 'interview', 'clips', 'producer', 'Martin', 'Bregman', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'top', 'off', 'also', '2', 'minutes', 'yet', 'somehow', 'redundant', 'Serpico', 'Favorite', 'Moments', 'interview', 'clips', 'Bregman', 'Lumet', 'talking', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'string', 'together', 'be', 'more', 'fluent', 'featurette', 'guess', 'seperating', 'way', 'could', 'make', 'Special', 'Features', 'resume', 'more', 'impressive.There', 'also', 'Photo', 'Gallery', 'Original', 'Trailor', 'available']",Serpico VHS

To watch Serpico is to see the fascination of the development of a character in Al Pacino. Also, Serpico is unique in combining authority and sub-culture in one person, and it works very well. I love the three parts about this film: the scene where Serpico explains his desire to be a cop, the moment when he finally gets the gold shield, and the final ending where I see him with a sheepdog and the closing statements. It is interesting to see him grow his beard and hair long while doing his job. All in all, Serpico is almost a near classic.8/11: When I think of Al Pacino, I think of Serpico. What a great performance. Unfortunately, the film isn't up to par as I hoped. The biggest drawback of it is the pacing. At times, it moves well, but much of it is very slow. If you look at the opening credits, especially the cast, you will notice that it only shows Al Pacino's name. That's it. The film is all Al Pacino as Frank Serpico. And that's one of the coolest on-screen characters I've ever seen. The hair, the clothes, the hats, the attitude and the whole get-up, I love it all. I also love the story, the hopelessness of it all, being defeated by the morass of the system. The ending is a classic. All in all, Serpico features the finest work in Al Pacino's career. I am raising the rating of Serpico from `8' to `9'.",5,Al Pacino's Greatest Performance.,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,1456,"['Viewed', '6/05', '8/11Rate', '96/05', 'great', 'performance', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'story', 'up', 'well', 'However', 'not', 'very', 'complete', 'watch', 'Serpico', 'see', 'fascination', 'development', 'character', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Also', 'Serpico', 'unique', 'combining', 'authority', 'sub-culture', 'one', 'person', 'very', 'well', 'love', 'three', 'parts', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'Serpico', 'desire', 'be', 'cop', 'moment', 'when', 'finally', 'gold', 'shield', 'final', 'ending', 'where', 'see', 'sheepdog', 'closing', 'statements', 'interesting', 'see', 'grow', 'beard', 'hair', 'long', 'doing', 'job', 'Serpico', 'almost', 'near', 'classic.8/11', 'When', 'think', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'think', 'Serpico', 'What', 'great', 'performance', 'Unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'hoped', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'pacing', 'times', 'well', 'much', 'very', 'slow', 'look', 'opening', 'credits', 'especially', 'cast', 'will', 'notice', 'only', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'name', 'film', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'one', 'coolest', 'on-screen', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hair', 'clothes', 'hats', 'attitude', 'whole', 'get-up', 'love', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'hopelessness', 'being', 'defeated', 'morass', 'system', 'ending', 'classic', 'Serpico', 'finest', 'work', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'career', 'am', 'raising', 'rating', 'Serpico', '8', '9']",Serpico VHS

Chronicling the true-life story of Frank Serpico, a police officer who exposed corruption in the NYPD, the film comes from that exquisite golden age of cinema, lasting from the late '60s through the late '70s, when paranoia infected the country and our most trusted and honored institutions were becoming suspect.  It's got the grainy, neo-realistic feel that so many of the films from that time period had (and as many of Lumet's own films had), yet it never really works.  Lumet's pacing is poor; no scene lasts longer than a minute or two.  While one would think this would make for a film with some narrative drive to it, just the opposite happens.  It's as if in the editing room all of the important parts of each scene got left out, and what we've been given as a final product is an outline of Serpico's story.  No characters beyond Pacino's is really developed, and even he struggles to make something substantial out of his role.  This came directly on the heels of ""The Godfather"" from the year before, the film that put Pacino on the map.  ""Serpico"" gives testament to Pacino's abilities and range as an actor; his performance is quite different from that of Michael Corleone. But for me, it's not until his mesmerizing performance in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" from 1975 that Pacino really flexes his acting muscles and shows what a true cinematic treasure he is.26 years later, Pacino was to star in ""The Insider,"" another thriller where he played a character who helps to expose corruption, this time in the world of corporate America.  My advice is to see ""Serpico"" for the place it holds in Pacino's career, but then see ""The Insider"" for a suspenseful, terrific movie.Grade: C",3,A Disappointment from Two Cinema Greats,1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,1797,"['film', 'directed', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'starring', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'Serpico', 'mediocre', 'best', 'Chronicling', 'true-life', 'story', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'exposed', 'corruption', 'NYPD', 'film', 'exquisite', 'golden', 'age', 'cinema', 'lasting', 'late', ""'60s"", 'late', ""'70s"", 'when', 'paranoia', 'infected', 'country', 'most', 'trusted', 'honored', 'institutions', 'were', 'becoming', 'suspect', 'got', 'grainy', 'neo-realistic', 'feel', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'time', 'period', 'had', 'many', 'Lumet', 'own', 'films', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'Lumet', 'pacing', 'poor', 'scene', 'longer', 'minute', 'two', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'narrative', 'drive', 'just', 'opposite', 'happens', 'editing', 'room', 'important', 'parts', 'scene', 'got', 'left', 'out', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'final', 'product', 'outline', 'Serpico', 'story', 'characters', 'Pacino', 'really', 'developed', 'even', 'make', 'something', 'substantial', 'role', 'came', 'directly', 'heels', 'Godfather', 'year', 'before', 'film', 'put', 'Pacino', 'map', 'Serpico', 'testament', 'Pacino', 'abilities', 'range', 'actor', 'performance', 'quite', 'different', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'not', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', '1975', 'Pacino', 'really', 'flexes', 'acting', 'muscles', 'what', 'true', 'cinematic', 'treasure', 'years', 'later', 'Pacino', 'was', 'star', 'Insider', 'thriller', 'where', 'played', 'character', 'who', 'expose', 'corruption', 'time', 'world', 'corporate', 'America', 'advice', 'see', 'Serpico', 'place', 'Pacino', 'career', 'then', 'see', 'Insider', 'suspenseful', 'terrific', 'movie.Grade', 'C']",Serpico VHS

I love everything about this film especially Al Pacino who gives the performance of a lifetime. Pacino was so convinving as undercover cop Frank Serpico that it is scary. This film defined the way police corruption is looked upon in the eyes of everyday policemen and it also became one of the first films in the 1970's to explore the antihero in its most complex form. This movie was s smash hit at the box office in 1973, when it was release and it was nominated for I believe five Academy Awards including Best Picure of the year and the Best Actor for Al Pacino, sadly enough neither the film or the actor won the coveted award. A lot of people say that it was The Godfather that Pacino proved that he was a great actor and even though in The Godfather he did an excellent job as Michael Corleone, it was in SERPICO, that I feel he was at his very best. He did follow with other great films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and BOBBY DEERFILED and he was brilliant in both but it was after watching SERPICO for the first time that I became aware of Pacino's brilliant acting talent. This film is a MUST if you care about excellence in acting or if you just one to see a great movie.  I highly recommend the book in which the film is based on it is also excellent. You should read the book first and then see the movie to get a better understanding of everthing that the character goes thru but either way if you see the film first and read the book after is no biggie.

It is widely known that  unprofessionalism and lax ethics runs rampant to this day throughout the force, and it is readily apparent in the way they treat ordinary citizens on the street to say nothing about protestors, minorities, or at times even elected officials.The best parts of Serpico do a fine job of portraying the subtle and not-so-subtle pushing and prodding, the hazing that goes underway with cops. But Pacino chose to play this part as something of the antithesis of Michael Corleone and I actually found his character rather uncompelling. He kind of does this compromised ""staring of into the distance"" thing with his acting (a man caught in the middle) throughout the film, and then gets annoyed in a couple of scenes. The real Frank Serpico has a nasally, annoying voice and Pacino incorporated this into his character -- but the whole thing comes across as kind of half-baked and even corny -- he's the hepcat hiPpiE cOp. You can tell that everyone at the studio and behind the scenes played up this angle to the extreme. Only it just sits on the surface.So tonally the film is very preachy and way overlong, shot in a kind of docudrama style that has message written all over it. Although Lumet was known for his ""gritty"" style, I have always found it workmanlike. I never got the feel for the energy of New York street of the early 70s from Serpico, nor much of the inspiration for the lead character wanting to be a cop in the first place. This is a ""man in the middle"" film that is so enamored with its theme of urban corruption it just never hits its stride.

It is important because it demonstrated that Al Pacino could carry a successful film as the star.  The supporting cast was excellent as well.  This movie is based on the true life story of a New York City police officer who joined the force as an idealistic young man only to discover that the force was full of corruption.  The more he fought against the corrupt policemen that he worked with every day, the more corruption he discovered and the more he found that as a single man trying to uncover the wrongdoing of the force and trying to make a difference in a positive way, the more frustrated he became.  Eventually, when he found all other avenues closed to him, he went to the media, the New York Times and a commission was finally formed to investigate the issues in the department.  For his trouble and trying to do the right thing, Serpico was shot and almost killed by fellow police officers.  At one point, he was told that a police officer who did not take money when it was offered could not be trusted.  Since Serpico could not be trusted, a conspiracy was formed to eliminate him.  His idealism quickly became frustration and cynicism.Serpico lives on in real life in Europe.  This movie is based on a book by Peter Haas and the account is pretty much true to life and not fictionalized. The women in his life and his family are pictured and add realism to the story and also are a sounding board to the frustration that he experienced during these years. Serpico grew as a person and during the course of the film, Al Pacino shows himself to be a brilliant actor. This early film helped set him as a versitile and talented actor.

The Godfather was really Marlon Brando's showcase vehicle, and The Godfather, Part Two was a year away, while Dog Day Afternoon, also with Lumet, was another year further out. Pacino's Frank Serpico covers alot of ground in his time on the force, and the two and a quarter hour film moves so briskly that it seems much longer, but in the good sense. As a biopic, it wisely focuses on the meat of the man's public impact, not a cradle to grave psychodrama. We see the thousand little ways that corruption breeds and spreads. Not only is evident it out and out graft and bribery, but in parking ticket quotas, freeby lunches, and the like of countless seemingly harmless acts. Serpico will have none of it, as he is shunted from precinct to precinct, and mocked by his fellow cops as a goody-goody, untrustworthy, and dangerous- all because he's decent and ethical. The non-stop harassment eats away at his insides and his mind, destroys his relationships with women, and lands him on a mission to clean things up, by whatever means he can.However, bureaucracy slows down his quest, until he connects with another cop, Bob Blair (Tony Roberts), who guides him across minefields of political machinations, until they both decide to go public to the New York Times. Consequently, Serpico is abandoned on a drug bust, by his partners, and shot in the face- the point at which the film begins, then proceeds to its coda. The film ends with Serpico going public at the Knapp Commission hearings, and then we get the credits telling us of the aftermath. Sidney Lumet had a perfect grasp of the streets and the times in this film, and the old clich&eacute;s about them not making films like this any more is true. Compare this to the Academy Award-level `issues' films of recent vintage- The Hours, Million Dollar Baby, Monster, or this year's Brokeback Mountain- and there's simply no comparison. Realistic, but poetic, films like this are just not made by the damnable Hollywood machine any longer. And few independent films can afford the budget and time needed to craft so meticulous a work- Joe Carnahan's recent Ray Liotta vehicle Narc being a welcome exception. Yet, films like this, Dog Day Afternoon, The French Connection, The Conversation, Taxi Driver, All The President's Men, Apocalypse Now, and the like, still tug at the American psyche.

SERPICO is a classic of 1970s cinema and of Lumet's film catalog.  Watching SERPICO is like taking a big breath of fresh air.  I love returning to the realism of the 1970s.  Lumet's camera always seems to cut right through all of the muck, casting a bright light on his character's lives, situations, and surroundings.  SERPICO is the true story of a virtuous cop in a corrupt system.  A veteran of the plain clothes unit, Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) lives and breathes the streets of New York.  We follow him from his graduation from the academy and observe his entire progression as a cop in the force.Pacino is at the top of his art form: he lives and breathes this cop.  Things start going badly for Serpico because he is the only plain clothes cop in the city who is not accepting bribes from the local gangsters and underworld.  While Serpico lives in an idealistic world in which the cops are cleaning up the streets and making New York a safer place to live, the other cops are merely using the force to make a very good living.  They give no thought or care for crime.As Serpico begins to seek advice and counsel on how to improve his situation, he begins to realize just how far the corruption goes.  SERPICO works because it traps our character.  He is a cop.  He has always wanted to be a cop.  He cannot just quit.  But he can't turn to anyone for help either because the whole force is corrupt.  What is ironic is that in a world of drugs, murder, and money, Serpico's greatest enemies are his fellow police officers.SERPICO is not a terribly uplifting film.  It is inspiring to watch a man whose character is so unquestionable that you feel bad for your own inadequacies and failings.  But it is also hard to see a good man suffer at the hands of a corrupt system.  Please: see this movie and give it the reviews that it deserves.

In 'Serpico' Al shows us he just doesn't do gangster roles.  Based on a true story, 'Serpico' is about an honest cop who is caught in a dishonest police department.  The beginning sequences are dreamy and happy, but soon it becomes much darker.  Soon Serpico realizes being honest is more dangerous then being corrupt.  The entire department is against him and there are physical attacks on him.  It goes to the point where he loses his girlfriend.  That was good though because the girlfriend was a bad actress.  That was one of two main flaws of the movie.  Some of the acting was bad and the screenplay was weak.

His work in Serpico is full of the beauty and rage of classic poetry.Lumet's direction is street-smart, bordering on documentary style at times, absolutely riveting from the first image of a gravely wounded Serpico to the last shot of Serpico with his dog, all alone in the world with his integrity.  Lumet also manages to bring in humorous scenes, such as the one in which Serpico and other cops try marijuana and get the munchies--sounds silly, but it's not.  Lumet is an actor's director and lets his cast establish the momentum of the film.The supporting cast is uniformly impressive, with Tony Roberts as an interesting foil for Serpico and a host of solid character actors playing various cops who are hostile to or just plain weirded out by Serpico.The extras are not bad, although I was hoping to find out more about the ""real"" Frank Serpico.  He does have an interesting website and is very much alive and well, in spite of all the tragedy he has faced.Actually, this movie shows that there are 2 ""real Frank Serpicos,"" and one of them was Al Pacino in 1973.  The only slight criticism I have of the movie is a tendency to make Frank look too good and everyone in the NYPD (almost) look like a scumbag--he almost comes across as Saint Francis, not just Frank--but, it's a movie no matter how gritty it is, and some oversimplification goes with the territory.

221926,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,6300216543,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 1]","Ever heard of Al Pacino? Well, I'm sure you have. Ever seen Scarface, The Insider, Heat? Or how about Dog Day Afternoon, The Panic in Needle Park, or Scent of a Woman? Yeah, he's been in numerous movies ever since the early 70's, and I'm sure you recognize at least his face. But in case you haven't noticed, Al Pacino is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of 20th-century cinema. In fact, he's one of my favorite actors of all time, and there's a very good reason for it: this guy can really act. He's been parodied several times on film and on TV, but that's because everyone knows how good he is. From The Godfather trilogy to Insomnia, his performances are MORE then just solid gold. A professional method actor, he simply becomes his characters, whether they are fictional (Ricky Roma) or real-life (Lowell Bergman). He's not Al Pacino in The Godfather trilogy, he's Michael Corleone in the Godfather trilogy. He's not himself in Dick Tracy, he's ""Big Boy"" Caprice. No matter how you look at it, this guy is a living legend among actors. However, if Glengarry Glen Ross or Carlito's Way doesn't impress you enough, then maybe Serpico will.When The Godfather was released back in 1972, it made Pacino, who was unknown at the time, a movie star. Studio executives already saw him as a ""profitable"" performer, but it looked like Pacino was concentrating more on cinematic material rather than money, because his next movie didn't look and feel like a typical Hollywood-style film. Serpico is based on the real-life story of Frank Serpico, a cop who refused to adapt to the corruption that took place in the NYPD. The film was made back in the early 70's, and the budget looks pretty modest from the looks of it, but that's beside the point. What really matters is how mesmerizing this movie is. This is a carefully-directed tour de force that showcases not only Pacino's spectacular acting talents, but also gives us an incredibly solid character study of the man who would become famous in police departments everywhere. Here is an individual who is honest and is fully dedicated to his work, but who is also tormented by the fact that the people he is working with are secretly breaking laws. This would result in him fighting against corruption, with some severe sacrifices along the way. I must say that Pacino plays the part perfectly, of course. The appearance, the mannerisms, and the ANGER of Frank Serpico are shown with real strength and heart. This is one of his greatest roles.Aside from the fact that this movie showcases young Pacino at his best, the movie is photographed beautifully and written extraordinarily well. Director Sydney Lumet breaks away from over-the-top action and suspense and delivers with a slow and steady pace, which I think is really appropriate for this kind of film. The supporting cast (Barbara Eda-Young as Laurie, Tony Roberts as Blair, John Randolph as Sidney Green) is all-around excellent. The music by Mikis Theodorakis is a pleasure to listen to (except during one specific sequence, in which the music sounds as cheesy as the theme for a 70's cop show).After my first viewing of Serpico, I instantly fell in love with it. It has quickly become one of my favorite films of all time. I think that the movie is going to get better and better after repeated viewings. In conclusion, this is a great movie, and if you're a fan of Pacino, then you have to see this film. Too bad, though, that the DVD has now been discontinued. You'll have to buy a new copy as quickly as possible, or just purchase a used one from here or elsewhere.Grade: A",5,Success after The Godfather,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,3589,"['Ever', 'heard', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'Ever', 'seen', 'Scarface', 'Insider', 'Heat', 'how', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Panic', 'Needle', 'Park', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Yeah', 'been', 'numerous', 'movies', 'ever', 'early', '70', ""'m"", 'sure', 'recognize', 'least', 'face', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', '20th-century', 'cinema', 'fact', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'time', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'guy', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'been', 'parodied', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'TV', 'everyone', 'how', 'good', 'Godfather', 'trilogy', 'Insomnia', 'performances', 'are', 'MORE', 'then', 'just', 'solid', 'gold', 'professional', 'method', 'actor', 'simply', 'characters', 'are', 'fictional', 'Ricky', 'Roma', 'real-life', 'Lowell', 'Bergman', 'not', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Godfather', 'trilogy', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'Godfather', 'trilogy', 'not', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'Big', 'Boy', 'Caprice', 'matter', 'how', 'look', 'guy', 'living', 'legend', 'actors', 'However', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'Carlito', 'Way', ""n't"", 'impress', 'enough', 'then', 'maybe', 'Serpico', 'will.When', 'Godfather', 'was', 'released', 'back', '1972', 'made', 'Pacino', 'who', 'was', 'unknown', 'time', 'movie', 'star', 'Studio', 'executives', 'already', 'saw', 'profitable', 'performer', 'looked', 'Pacino', 'was', 'concentrating', 'more', 'cinematic', 'material', 'rather', 'money', 'next', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'feel', 'typical', 'Hollywood-style', 'film', 'Serpico', 'based', 'real-life', 'story', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'cop', 'who', 'refused', 'adapt', 'corruption', 'took', 'place', 'NYPD', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'back', 'early', '70', 'budget', 'pretty', 'modest', 'looks', 'beside', 'point', 'What', 'really', 'matters', 'how', 'mesmerizing', 'movie', 'carefully-directed', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'not', 'only', 'Pacino', 'spectacular', 'acting', 'talents', 'also', 'incredibly', 'solid', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'famous', 'police', 'departments', 'everywhere', 'Here', 'individual', 'who', 'honest', 'fully', 'dedicated', 'work', 'who', 'also', 'tormented', 'fact', 'people', 'working', 'are', 'secretly', 'breaking', 'laws', 'would', 'result', 'fighting', 'corruption', 'severe', 'sacrifices', 'way', 'must', 'say', 'Pacino', 'part', 'perfectly', 'course', 'appearance', 'mannerisms', 'ANGER', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'are', 'shown', 'real', 'strength', 'heart', 'one', 'greatest', 'roles.Aside', 'fact', 'movie', 'young', 'Pacino', 'best', 'movie', 'photographed', 'beautifully', 'written', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'Director', 'Sydney', 'Lumet', 'away', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'suspense', 'delivers', 'slow', 'steady', 'pace', 'think', 'really', 'appropriate', 'kind', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Barbara', 'Eda-Young', 'Laurie', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'Blair', 'John', 'Randolph', 'Sidney', 'Green', 'all-around', 'excellent', 'music', 'Mikis', 'Theodorakis', 'pleasure', 'listen', 'one', 'specific', 'sequence', 'music', 'as', 'cheesy', 'theme', '70', 'cop', 'show', '.After', 'first', 'viewing', 'Serpico', 'instantly', 'fell', 'love', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'think', 'movie', 'going', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'conclusion', 'great', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Pacino', 'then', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'Too', 'bad', 'though', 'DVD', 'now', 'been', 'discontinued', ""'ll"", 'have', 'buy', 'new', 'copy', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'just', 'purchase', 'used', 'one', 'here', 'elsewhere.Grade']",Serpico VHS

The score and audio tracks have also been cleaned up in this Paramount re-release, and it's worth every cent.Sidney Lumet is often thought of as an actors' director, more so than a cinematic genius, but &quot;Serpico&quot; more than delivers in both arenas.  Al Pacino's portrayal of the eccentric Frank Serpico -- a NYPD cop of unyielding integrity -- is one of his best roles ever.  He's animated, tough and very human in his role, and one can sense that a lot of the real Serpico rubbed off on him.  &quot;Serpico&quot; also boasts an excellent supporting cast.

Murray Abraham, Judd Hirsch.Director Lumet is featured in the two &quot;making of&quot; featurettes that are included on the DVD, and it's fascinating hearing his method of shooting and his and producer Martin Bregman's reminisences.

Serpico isn't quite as timeless as Pacino's and Lumet's second collaboration - the classic Dog Day Afternoon (also based on a true story, but with a bit more liberties taken) - but it rises entirely thanks to Pacino, who turned Serpico into a universal icon of integrity and idealism, with his beard, long hair and penetrating stare, as a hero who fights within the establishment and against it.Along with The Godfather saga and Dog Day Afternoon this is one of Pacino's greatest performances, and one that earned him an Oscar nomination, and helped make him one of the prominent American actors of the 70's, alongside the likes of Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman. Serpico was a part of the revolution in American cinema in that period, which was becoming younger, darker and grittier - and like films such as Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, Dog Day Afternoon, Straw Dogs, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Midnight Cowboy - it stands the test of time. It's definitely not the best of that list, and it's not high on the list of all-time essential classics; but it's fascinating, gritty, realistic drama, with an important message, and for Pacino's performance alone it's worth every minute.",5,David vs. Goliath in New York City,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,1514,"['story', 'police', 'officer', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'who', 'practically', 'single-handedly', 'took', 'stand', 'enormous', 'corruption', 'NYPD', 'paid', 'dearly', 'still', 'fascinating', 'still', 'relevant', 'thanks', 'killer', 'performance', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'biopic', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'test', 'time', 'Serpico', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'timeless', 'Pacino', 'Lumet', 'second', 'collaboration', 'classic', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'also', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'bit', 'more', 'liberties', 'taken', 'entirely', 'thanks', 'Pacino', 'who', 'turned', 'Serpico', 'universal', 'icon', 'integrity', 'idealism', 'beard', 'long', 'hair', 'penetrating', 'stare', 'hero', 'who', 'establishment', 'it.Along', 'Godfather', 'saga', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'one', 'Pacino', 'greatest', 'performances', 'one', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'helped', 'make', 'one', 'prominent', 'American', 'actors', '70', 'likes', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Serpico', 'was', 'part', 'revolution', 'American', 'cinema', 'period', 'was', 'becoming', 'younger', 'darker', 'grittier', 'films', 'such', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'test', 'time', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'list', 'not', 'high', 'list', 'all-time', 'essential', 'classics', 'fascinating', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'drama', 'important', 'message', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'alone', 'worth', 'minute']",Serpico VHS

221942,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6300216543,J from NY,"[1, 1]","Sidney Lumet's film ""Serpico"" is a brilliant depiction of Peter Maas' book on this simple, angry, and compassionate man who would end up turning the NYPD on it's head with the Knaap Hearings and firsthand eyewitness accounts of police corruption.Frank Serpico, now 73, is played by a young Al Pacino straight off the first installment of the ""Godfather"" trilogy.  An idealistic young man who expects nothing more than to do what a police officer is actually supposed to do--protect the innocent and fight crime wherever it is found--finds himself in the NYPD of the early to late 1960's.  This a time in which the Italian American mafia had grown in power very significantly, before the Joseph Pistones and Henry Hills and Sammy Gravanos of the world appeared.  Lumet's skill in filming pre-Giuliani NYC almost reaches the level of Martin Scorsese.From the first frame of the film one can see what is coming.  Serpico's alienation from his lazy, alarmingly serene fellow police officers is at first harmless, but when he realizes the reasons for their serenity (a cop gives him an envelope filled with 300 dollars for no apparent reason) the nightmare begins.  Naturally he believes that taking it to an authority figure in the department will start some kind of investigation.  He is told (and this is taken directly from the book) that if he decides to make any trouble over it he will be discovered ""facedown in the East River"" once all the investigations are over.  The Commissioner seems almost annoyed that he has to be bothered with any of this.  Doesn't Serpico know that the guys take money from mobsters and shake down drug dealers?  What planet is he from?This story is almost biblical in nature and Lumet certainly took pains to make the other cops (with the exception of one or two other honest cops who tried to help him) around Serpico look agents from some Satanic agency a la Miss Baylock in the Omen.  Obese, cruel looking, base and violent, his position of honesty and refusal to participate even one inch in any division's dishonesty makes you fear for the guy.In the tradition of the saints, he remains joyful and full of life despite his untenable situation.  Girlfriend after girlfriend come and go, at first enjoying his joie de la vivre and then being overwhelmed by his moods of agitation and fury at the corruption surrounding him.  Pacino does all this with his trademark intensity: perhaps the best scene in the film, also taken from the book, is when he humiliates a mobster who he arrests on the street for running numbers and who is a good buddy of all the men he works with.Running from official to official, he is screwed around with to the point where one can visibly see him losing faith in the system.  His best friend, a more formal but equally just cop (Bob Blair played by Tony Roberts in an understated, realistic performance) uses all the connections he has to get Serpico a hearing on police corruption.It happens, but not before Serpico is set up by a group of his fellow officers and shot in the face.This is a tale for the ages and one which should not be forgotten.  The might of one strong, good man truly cannot be nailed down by a thousand weak corrupt ones.

221949,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6300216543,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 2]","One of the more underrated performances of Al Pacino's gifted early career, SERPICO was filmed in between THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER, PART TWO, and was quickly followed by another incredible performance in DOG DAY AFTERNOON.Pacino plays frank Serpico, a New York cop who couldn't be bought. Based on the biography SERPICO by Peter Maas, Producer Martin Stegman and Director Sidney Lumet capture perfectly the gritty realities of Frank Serpico's tenure with New York's Finest, when for a time it seemed that Serpico was alone in his refusal to take graft and his resistance to the system that allowed it to flourish. Other cops hated him. These qualities nearly cost Serpico his life, as he went to the New York Times to expose police corruption.The film is an artifact of its era (the early Seventies) and maintains a steady but not frenetic pace. SERPICO's visual and stylistic influence can be clearly seen in such TV cop dramas as the old KOJAK, and today's LAW & ORDER and NYPD BLUE.Pacino embodies Serpico's mix of innocence, frustration and impotent rage at the machine even more effectively than Maas's book does. He also plays out Serpico's rather unconventional Sixties lifestyle to the hilt, a lifestyle that made Serpico a pariah amongst his fellows. Watch carefully: The ""be-in"" party scene beautifully foreshadows Pacino's performance as SCARFACE Tony Montana in the Club Babylon ten years later, and Pacino's depiction of Serpico's assumption of disguises (as a junkie, a deliveryman, and a Hasidic rabbi) are moments of humor in what is overall a rather grim biopic.Serpico was eventually shot in the face by a pusher while on narcotics detail, and lay unattended and bleeding profusely while his fellow cops went after the perpetrator.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 0]","Al Pacino had appeared in ""The Godfather"", but was not yet the film icon that he started to become, in part, because of ""Serpico"".  Francisco Serpico was an honest Italian cop - courageously honest.  When he saw widespread corruption among New York Cops everywhere he was offered the opportunity to participate in the payoffs that the police were receiving left and right.  Initially, Serpico simply abstained.  The corrupt cops became of suspicious of Serpico - at one point in the film he is told ""who can trust a cop who won't take a payoff?""  Because of his dedication to honest police work and a burning desire to ""do the right thing"" Serpico goes from a non-participant in the graft to actively fighting it.  He is understandably frustrated over and over when his reports to the police authorities are met with not much more than ""you're doing a good job, Frank, keep up the good work and we'll reach out for you when the time is right"".  The right time never arrives and Serpico, prodded by his friend Bob Blair (played by Tony Roberts), brings his complaints outside of the department - first to the Mayor's office, then finally to the New York Times.Serpico is treated by his fellow police officers initially as an eccentric goody-goody, then later subjected to death threats.  The film is bookended by a sequence in Serpico's life when he is transferred to a narcotics division then probably set-up for assassination.  The point-blank bullet that Serpico's partners lead him into doesn't kill him and Frank is alive today, lecturing at police academies and for organizations interested in having a ""lamp lighter"" - giving support to those who have the inclination, but perhaps not the courage, to speak up about things that are plain wrong.Now, thinking about the film later, I wonder what was going on in the minds of the other policemen.  Presumably, many of them didn't WANT to be crooked cops.  Certainly the ""extra"" money that they received was tempting - perhaps they looked at those extra dollars as compensation for what was not a lot of pay in a dangerous profession.Serpico is one of the most visible examples of someone ""doing the right thing"" against incredible odds, even as his life was threatened.

It was Sidney Lumet's ""Serpico"" released a year later, that confirmed his status as a movie star in his own right. This true story of an NYPD cop standing alone in the midst of corruption on a staggering scale, is both compelling and engaging. Pacino immerses himself in the role and it's not only his appearance that changes as the movie progresses. It seemed as though I could see the exhaustion gradually wearing him down from the sheer stress of trying to do his job with integrity, while enduring the hostility of his colleagues and the futility of fighting a system he couldn't beat.

The film that cemented Mr. Pacino as one of the best actors of his generation was Serpico.  Based on the Peter Maas book of the same name, Serpico is the true story of a New York undercover cop who seems to be the only honest cop on the force. Due to his honest nature, the other cops are leery of him and refuse to accept him as a real cop.  To that end, he moves from precinct to precinct in search of a friendly work environment, but wherever he goes, he finds the same old situation.  Serpico then goes to the higher-ups in the department, but they too have no use for his accusations.  Finally, he goes public with his accusations and that triggers an investigation into the dealings of police officers.  Serpico becomes a marked man and is nearly intentionally killed by another cop who while Serpico is on an undercover operation.  Mr. Pacino brings a realistic approach to the role and you feel sympathy for Serpico.

It's one of those movies that brings me to an abrupt stop when I'm channel surfing although I don't come across it that much lately.  Many people may have forgotten or never knew the story of the New York City policeman named Frank Serpico.  However, his revelations about graft and corruption in the NYC Police Dept were a major event in the city.Al Pacino does a terrific job of bringing the character of Serpico to the screen.  His unassuming but tenacious effort to just be an honest cop makes for a different sort of hero.  From practically his first day on the job he is confronted by offers of bribes and he soon comes to realize that it is systematic throughout the force.  Every time he thinks he's found someone to hear his protests he's reminded that everyone is part of the problem or afraid to do anything about it.  The way the whole story is woven makes for an interesting movie but it is the acting that raises the level even higher.  This seems to be just the sort of role made for Al Pacino.  The script enables him to be more than just a cop.  There is a romantic and social side of Serpico.  However, that may only have been as an opportunity to show the effects of his obsession and frustration with reforming the system.  His achievement ends up being a pyrrhic victory.Some of the scenes seemed a bit exagerated but my biggest complaint about ""Serpico"" is quality of the cinematography.  Each time I've seen it on TV it looked like we were watching a very used video.  I haven't purchased or seen a new DVD version but I trust someone was able to clean it up.

I'd even go as far to say that Lumet might have been one of the pioneers of movies that inspired the best directors of today to ask questions like ""is that what would really happen"" and ""is that how a person would really respond"" before allowing a scene to get printed.Serpico still had its 70s era movie making quirks, but overall it was ahead of its time for making you feel ""truly involved"" with its characters. And having a young, talented Al Pacino in the cast (as the lead) certainly helped make an award-winning film. (The year prior {1972} Pacino made his breakthrough in The GodfatherThe Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III).)Serpico is based on the real-life exploits of a NYC cop that is credited with exposing broad, long-standing corruption in the NYC police department (Serpico was a cop from 1959 - 1971). Clearly this exposure was not wanted by his colleagues. And the 1973 movie is a dramatic documentation of what Serpico went through trying to be an honest cop.The movie gets a bit long in the badge by the final 30 minutes, but the suspense of seeing if/how Frank Serpico collars his peers keeps you interested.The audio wizards have given Serpico a nice Dolby 5.1 make-over, and the picture quality has been enhanced as well.

Here it's the New York City police, and you can see how Peter Maas's book on the real Serpico must have appealed to him. But his way into such stories is through character, and Al Pacino gives us a here a stubborn, honest, not-always-likable man who simply can't stand it that so many police are on the take -- not always in a very big way, but to Serpico, you're either honest or your not. And of course, his colleagues in the police department soon find out that he won't take money -- he doesn't hide the fact that he won't -- and you have this absurd situation where his colleagues don't trust him because he's honest. The story of the movie is of Serpico's increasing isolation, and the psychological toll it takes on him and on those who love him. He never goes Howard Beale-crazy, but he becomes paranoid too, and yet he wants to remain a cop. By the end, after a series of transfers into new precincts and jurisdictions where his reputation precedes him, he is distrusted before he even starts, and in his final assignment, in a Brooklyn narcotics squad, we see his new colleagues making him do the most dangerous work and hesitating to help him when he gets in trouble. ( I had recently watched John Wayne in ""Red River,"" and Pacino's stubborn, willful sense of his rightness is similarly troubling, even though he is more clearly ""right"" than Wayne's character.)Lumet's direction is excellent. You don't get pretty pictures -- just an unobtrusive rightness about the setting and cinematography of every scene. The same is true of movies like ""Network"" and ""The Verdict"" with their very different settings. And action is always tightly tied to character revelation, so that none of the gunfights and chases seem gratuitous.  Lumet also knows that you can't treat serious, systemic corruption -- corruption that goes ""right to the top"" of an organization -- and end a narrative with a sentimental kiss-off.  As in ""The Verdict"" and ""Network,"" the ending of ""Serpico"" is dark, consonant with the story.  Remember the scene where Serpico is testifying to the investigating committee?  All the high-level corrupt actors are still there, still in charge.  There's a tough-mindedness about Lumet that one can't help but respect.The supporting cast of largely unheralded actors is excellent, and Pacino (in 1973 just a year out from ""Godfather"" Part 1) gives a performance of great intensity that nevertheless is not all about chewing the scenery -- and, as we know, Pacino can chew scenery better than anybody (see ""The Devil's Advocate""). Given that Serpico, as an undercover cop, is often himself ""acting,"" the focus and discipline of Pacino's attention to the character is impressive.

But for me, the cream of Pacino's crop was in the 1970s, and among his great performances in that decade was in the 1973 movie ""Serpico.""  In this feature directed by Sidney Lumet (who also directed another Pacino film, 1975's ""Dog Day Afternoon""), Al plays a cop who joins the force with the best of intentions.  He's honest, sincere, and treats criminal suspects impartially--qualities that should enable an officer to advance in his field.  Instead, Frank's kindness and humanity make him an object of scorn and contempt among his peers, who engage in shady dealings and suspicious activity.  Frank's job ultimately takes a toll on his life, both professionally and romantically, and by the end of the movie, he's transformed from an eager-to-please cop to a jaded officer.  The movie is an effective and scathing commentary on police corruption, and it earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor (he was previously nominated for Best Supporting Actor for 1972's ""The Godfather"").  The DVD offers a decent picture and surround sound for a movie of this age, and the extras include retrospective interviews with the filmmakers.  I was disappointed that Pacino isn't featured in any of these interviews, but aside from that, I thought they were overall informative.

221998,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,6300216543,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[1, 2]","Sidney Lument made a brilliant move choosing to direct Serpico. And executive producer Dino De Laurentiis made a brilliant move choosing him to direct it. This is the film that put Al Pacino on the map.With realistic acting and realistic actors - no makeup and flashy costumes and shots- Serpico has a gritty realistic feel that makes the story stand out even more than it would have otherwise. Al Pacino showcases his acting technique in the portrayal of a beleaguered New York cop who just wants to do his job. When he finds himself amidst high levels of corruption and money payoffs, he sets out to make it right. Unfortunately, the higher up he goes, he only discovers that the corruption is higher up than he could have thought.Time has been good to this film and it still shines over 30 years later as a superb police film and real-life dramatization. Frank Serpico is a hero in the true sense of the word: putting his own life on the line in order to stop corruption.The DVD package is great, and includes several special features including a making of featurette where director Sidney Lument talks about his quick and dirty directing style (and the fact that Serpico went from filming to theatre in only five months). There's also a short about Serpico himself, and the book by Peter Maas, that the movie was based on, as well as a brief short with Lument detailing his favorite scenes from the film.Don't miss this film if you want to see a monument of cinematic quality and Pacino establishing himself as a true star.",5,Monument of cinematic quality,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,1527,"['Sidney', 'Lument', 'made', 'brilliant', 'move', 'choosing', 'direct', 'Serpico', 'executive', 'producer', 'Dino', 'De', 'Laurentiis', 'made', 'brilliant', 'move', 'choosing', 'direct', 'film', 'put', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'map.With', 'realistic', 'acting', 'realistic', 'actors', 'makeup', 'flashy', 'costumes', 'shots-', 'Serpico', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'feel', 'story', 'stand', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'acting', 'technique', 'portrayal', 'beleaguered', 'New', 'York', 'cop', 'who', 'just', 'do', 'job', 'When', 'amidst', 'high', 'levels', 'corruption', 'money', 'payoffs', 'out', 'make', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'higher', 'only', 'corruption', 'higher', 'up', 'could', 'have', 'thought.Time', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'still', '30', 'years', 'later', 'superb', 'police', 'film', 'real-life', 'dramatization', 'Frank', 'Serpico', 'hero', 'true', 'sense', 'word', 'putting', 'own', 'life', 'line', 'order', 'stop', 'corruption.The', 'DVD', 'package', 'great', 'several', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'making', 'featurette', 'where', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Lument', 'talks', 'quick', 'dirty', 'directing', 'style', 'fact', 'Serpico', 'went', 'filming', 'theatre', 'only', 'five', 'months', 'also', 'short', 'Serpico', 'book', 'Peter', 'Maas', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'as', 'well', 'brief', 'short', 'Lument', 'detailing', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'monument', 'cinematic', 'quality', 'Pacino', 'establishing', 'true', 'star']",Serpico VHS
