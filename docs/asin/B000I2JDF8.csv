1018930,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000I2JDF8,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","A girl has got to do what a girl has to do, circa 1933. That is the overarching theme of the film under review, Baby Face. And what a down in the dregs speakeasy life, pimped off on by a money-grubbing Prohibition father girl does then, and now for that matter, is the best she can. And the best she can is to use her sexual attractiveness, her feminine wiles, and her gold-digger's heart to move up the social ladder. The film traces Baby Face's (played by a young and fetching, fetching more before she gets her hair all marcelled, Barbara Stanwyck) hard grind up the social scale using those talents. Starting from an ""easy rider"" on a tramp train up to the high and rarified airs of the CEO of a bank she single-mindedly get what she wants, or what she thinks she wants.Now this story of a girl doing the best she can is hardly a new one but what makes this film stand out is its rather explicit and upfront look at social reality and sexual themes. No question Baby Face is a kept woman, no question she will exchange her sexual favors for money, jewels, and maybe power, power over upscale men. These themes usually in the past have been kept under veil and this film, or rather films if you watch the two versions provided, is a no holds barred affair in the scramble to get out from under. The other version is a more sanitized offering, more up to Hollywood 1930s code.The companion films would make for a good cinema student's class project. Moreover, the underlining ""philosophy"" presented is rather startling for a ""fluff"" movie as Baby Face is early on exposed to a nutty professor-type  (really a shoemaker and  maybe no so nutty), a foreign nutty guy, who is touting the virtues of Nietzsche' Will To Power and his various war of all against all notions. That in 1933 (as Hitler starts kicking some Nietzsche doors down in troubled Germany). So all this socially significant material in an hour and one half film.

1018933,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,B000I2JDF8,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[1, 2]","Babyface stars a VERY young Barbara Stanwyck in a rare and early Warner Bros. sound film dating from the end of Prohibition to the worst years of the Great Depression.Stanwyck plays Lilly, the beautiful but jaded daughter of a speakeasy owner, in the tough, industrial town of Pittsburgh. Each night after work, an unwashed rabble of rough men come to a dingy 2nd floor dwelling, where Lilly serves their liquor.Her father seems to be pimping her. It is a grotesque life, but Lilly is tough and cynical, and she makes the best of it. An abusive man with a cigar forever in his mouth, her father gets his just desserts and dies early on when his still explodes.With no other family or possessions to keep her behind, Lilly takes the advice of an old mentor, a German cobbler man with a passion for Friedrich Nietzche, who advises her to leave for New York where she can ""will to power"", using her beauty to exploit men and make a new life for herself. She brings with her an African-American female comrade, Chico, who shares her adventures in the big city.Lilly wields her feminine charisma as an unabashed tool of survival. Love is her deadly weapon -- there's no bones about it. First step is just to land a job. A quick trip to an empty office with the personnel manager takes care of that problem.As she penetrates the corporate structure of a large bank (or vice versa), Lilly moves from man to man, all the way to the top, leaving fractured marriages and broken, lovesick men in her wake. The film almost turns this into a game of Monopoly for her. Her shameless, ""floor-by-floor"" strategic assault, as the camera zooms on a model skyscraper from one office to another, charts her course up the corporate ladder. Most unusual.With a story by Darryl Zanuck (later the studio head of 20th Century Fox for decades) under a pen name of Mark Canfield, the production values are impressive for the period, especially compared to ""Red Headed Woman"" from MGM -- which is also in the ""Forbidden Hollywood"" DVD set. Babyface is a copycat story (also similar, I'm told, in some aspects to Marlena Dietrich's ""Blue Angel""), but far better written and well-directed. Whereas Red-Headed Woman is often flat in choreography and direction, Warner Bros' Babyface is far superior in lighting, camera movement, set design, and editorial technique.From the peculiar 1930's-style open-title sequence with the funny actor vignettes, to the jazz-driven score, Babyface reflects its era so well. (Hey folks, instead of THX, it's ""Vitaphone"", the very latest technology!) The acting and dialogue of early talkies is lousy compared to modern films, and yet its purity and simplicity is part of its great charm. By today's standards, Babyface is physically tame, yet Lilly's immorality is hyperbolic, brutally honest. There are some great life lessons to be learned here, and Babyface never strays off topic. Warner Bros and Darryl Zanuck's story puts all the cards on the table.In the final act, the playboy-CEO of Gotham Bank, played by George Brent, falls for Lilly, and then sees his bank collapse in scandal. The Depression and Prohibition are just oozing out of this Art-Deco opus.This film aroused the censors and played a key role in the implementation of the Hayes Code. The ""pre-release"" version of Babyface (which was lost until it was discovered in the Library of Congress' vaults in 2004) is superior to the print that was shown to the public, but comparing the two censored and uncensored versions is what make the DVD release so very special. The two key areas of censorship for your review are the cobbler's advice to Lily in reel 1, and the ending of the film was also significantly changed.Babyface is a specialty item for connoisseurs of cinema that not all may appreciate, but it's a real treat for those who acquire a taste for it. The performances from the sexy Stanwyck and all her lovesick male suitors are an amusing and campy treasure. The Jazz-age settings, costumes, and hairstyles are lavish and nostalgic.  5 stars.",5,"There's Nothing Like a Little Good, Old-fashioned Immorality",1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,4024,"['Babyface', 'VERY', 'young', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'rare', 'early', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'sound', 'film', 'dating', 'end', 'Prohibition', 'worst', 'years', 'Great', 'Depression.Stanwyck', 'Lilly', 'beautiful', 'jaded', 'daughter', 'speakeasy', 'owner', 'tough', 'industrial', 'town', 'Pittsburgh', 'night', 'work', 'unwashed', 'rabble', 'rough', 'men', 'come', 'dingy', '2nd', 'floor', 'dwelling', 'where', 'Lilly', 'liquor.Her', 'father', 'be', 'pimping', 'grotesque', 'life', 'Lilly', 'tough', 'cynical', 'best', 'abusive', 'man', 'cigar', 'forever', 'mouth', 'father', 'just', 'desserts', 'dies', 'early', 'when', 'still', 'other', 'family', 'possessions', 'keep', 'behind', 'Lilly', 'advice', 'old', 'mentor', 'German', 'cobbler', 'man', 'passion', 'Friedrich', 'Nietzche', 'who', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'can', 'will', 'power', 'using', 'beauty', 'exploit', 'men', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'herself', 'African-American', 'female', 'comrade', 'Chico', 'who', 'shares', 'adventures', 'big', 'city.Lilly', 'feminine', 'charisma', 'unabashed', 'tool', 'survival', 'Love', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'bones', 'First', 'step', 'just', 'land', 'job', 'quick', 'trip', 'empty', 'office', 'personnel', 'manager', 'care', 'problem.As', 'corporate', 'structure', 'large', 'bank', 'vice', 'versa', 'Lilly', 'man', 'man', 'way', 'top', 'leaving', 'fractured', 'marriages', 'broken', 'lovesick', 'men', 'wake', 'film', 'almost', 'game', 'Monopoly', 'shameless', 'floor-by-floor', 'strategic', 'assault', 'camera', 'model', 'skyscraper', 'one', 'office', 'course', 'up', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'Most', 'unusual.With', 'story', 'Darryl', 'Zanuck', 'later', 'studio', 'head', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'decades', 'pen', 'name', 'Mark', 'Canfield', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'impressive', 'period', 'especially', 'compared', 'Red', 'Headed', 'Woman', 'MGM', 'also', 'Forbidden', 'Hollywood', 'DVD', 'set', 'Babyface', 'copycat', 'story', 'also', 'similar', ""'m"", 'told', 'aspects', 'Marlena', 'Dietrich', 'Blue', 'Angel', 'far', 'better', 'written', 'well-directed', 'Red-Headed', 'Woman', 'often', 'flat', 'choreography', 'direction', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Babyface', 'far', 'superior', 'lighting', 'camera', 'movement', 'set', 'design', 'editorial', 'peculiar', ""1930's-style"", 'open-title', 'sequence', 'funny', 'actor', 'vignettes', 'jazz-driven', 'score', 'Babyface', 'era', 'so', 'well', 'Hey', 'folks', 'instead', 'THX', 'Vitaphone', 'very', 'latest', 'technology', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'early', 'talkies', 'lousy', 'compared', 'modern', 'films', 'yet', 'purity', 'simplicity', 'part', 'great', 'charm', 'today', 'standards', 'Babyface', 'physically', 'tame', 'yet', 'Lilly', 'immorality', 'hyperbolic', 'brutally', 'honest', 'are', 'great', 'life', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'here', 'Babyface', 'never', 'topic', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Darryl', 'Zanuck', 'story', 'cards', 'table.In', 'final', 'act', 'playboy-CEO', 'Gotham', 'Bank', 'played', 'George', 'Brent', 'Lilly', 'then', 'bank', 'collapse', 'scandal', 'Depression', 'Prohibition', 'are', 'just', 'oozing', 'out', 'Art-Deco', 'opus.This', 'film', 'aroused', 'censors', 'played', 'key', 'role', 'implementation', 'Hayes', 'Code', 'pre-release', 'version', 'Babyface', 'was', 'lost', 'was', 'discovered', 'Library', 'Congress', 'vaults', '2004', 'superior', 'print', 'was', 'shown', 'public', 'comparing', 'two', 'censored', 'uncensored', 'versions', 'make', 'DVD', 'release', 'so', 'very', 'special', 'two', 'key', 'areas', 'censorship', 'review', 'are', 'cobbler', 'advice', 'Lily', 'reel', '1', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'significantly', 'changed.Babyface', 'specialty', 'item', 'connoisseurs', 'cinema', 'not', 'may', 'appreciate', 'real', 'treat', 'who', 'acquire', 'taste', 'performances', 'sexy', 'Stanwyck', 'lovesick', 'male', 'suitors', 'are', 'amusing', 'campy', 'treasure', 'Jazz-age', 'settings', 'costumes', 'hairstyles', 'are', 'lavish', 'nostalgic', '5', 'stars']",TCM Archives: Forbidden Hollywood Collection - Volume One (Waterloo Bridge / Baby Face / Red-Headed Woman)
1018934,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000I2JDF8,calvinnme,"[11, 12]","When Turner Classic Movies first came into existence they cleaned out Warner Brothers' vault of 1930's and 40's era classics. It's about time some of them came out in boxed sets such as this one. The theme of this particular box set is pre-code Hollywood, and includes three films that illustrate why the decency code came into existence.Film industry censorship began in 1922 following a trio of scandals that rocked Hollywood: the Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle murder trial, the never-solved murder of director William Desmond Taylor, and the drug-related death of matinee idol Wallace Reid. In 1930, a new version of the Production Code was drafted to standardize the censorship requirements of various states, since the inception of talking films made it difficult to arbitrarily cut offending scenes. However, the studios merely paid lip-service to the Code since they were more interested in finding ways to lure dwindling Depression era audiences into theatres. The pre-code era came to an abrupt close beginning July 1,1934, when watchdog groups threatened boycotts of all films and the Legion of Decency was established to monitor movies. Studio heads finally bowed to the public pressure and the era of censorship began, lasting until the establishment of the industry's rating system in 1968.In ""Baby Face"" Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck), hardened by growing up in a speakeasy, leaves her blue-collar town for New York determined to get ahead by any means necessary. Thanks to some sage advice from a local cobbler (Alphonse Ethier) she has taken to heart the teachings of Nietzsche and has decided to sleep her way to the top, floor by floor. In the end, she's gone through seven men, ruined lives, and lost what little bit of compassion and humanity she may have started out with in the beginning. She's married to the president of a bank and has a suitcase with over a half a million dollars in it, given to her by her husband during good times. However, her husband now is in trouble with the bank over business decisions he has made, and he needs the money that he once gave her to get the bank and himself out of trouble. Will Lily start over in poverty with the man she loves, or will she set sail with the money in her suitcase? It seems funny now, but one of the things that the censors had trouble with in this film and actually cut were some scenes with Lily discussing Nietzche's philosophy of turning situations where one is a victim into where you are in control. I guess this was a dangerous idea during the depths of the depression.In ""A Red Headed Woman"", Jean Harlow has her trademark platinum hair dyed an unlikely shade of red. Jean plays Lil, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who's determined to climb the business and social ladder in the same way that Stanwyck's character did in ""Baby Face"". Likewise, Jean sets her sights on her boss Bill and refuses to take ""no"" for an answer. In this film, though, her boss is already married. This doesn't bother or slow down Lil one bit. The shameless homewrecker uses every trick in the book to snag him until her behavior borders on what would be considered ""stalking"" in today's lexicon. Red Headed Woman wavers wildly between comedy and weighty melodrama, with Harlow showing great comic flair as well as pathos in her portrayal of Lil. More significant, though, is the plot. It is more than a little risqu&eacute;, and is an example of the type of film that simply couldn't be made a few years later. With marital infidelity, innuendos, violence, and sadism (when Bill finally slaps Lil out of frustration, she says, ""Hit me again! I like it!"") this is thoroughly adult fare, even by today's standards. Chester Morris was usually cast as a rather boring hero type, which makes him a perfect contrast opposite the amoral Harlow. Once Lil gets what she wants - married to Bill - society and her family do not accept her as such, and continue to side with Bill's cast-off first wife. Lil soon becomes bored with life as an executive's wife and goes back to her old ways. Will Bill see the light or will even more tragedy result for all involved?While the 1940 remake of the final film ""Waterloo Bridge"" starring Vivien Leigh might be better known, this 1931 original version of the acclaimed wartime romance stars Mae Clarke, who transcends the tawdry material with a luminous performance that should have assured her of a bigger career. Unfortunately, Waterloo Bridge remained out of the public eye for more than 50 years, leaving Clarke to be best remembered as the woman into whose face James Cagney smashes a grapefruit in ""The Public Enemy"". Her career never took off the way Harlow's and Stanwyck's did. In Waterloo Bridge, Mae Clarke is an American chorus girl who marries an officer in London during World War I. After he's reported missing, his family cruelly rejects her and, desperate to survive, she drifts into prostitution. However, remember that ""reported missing"", especially in the chaos of World War I battlefields, does not necessarily mean definitely dead. The heroine in this film, unlike the other two, is a somewhat sympathetic character. This is the one movie I had not previously seen, and it was quite good. It probably would be more remembered if it was not for the remake of nine years later that involved bigger stars.These are all excellent films especially with the restored footage, I found the video quality to be quite good even considering the age of the films, and the insightful commentary by Robert Osborne is always a welcome treat. The only bad thing I can say about the set is the somewhat high price which works out to about ten dollars a film, which is pretty pricey for three older movies, even if they are classics.",5,Three

He doesn't even offer her happiness, just to use this power she possesses as an attractive woman to turn the tables on the situation.  He reads and provides texts of Nietzsche as the literary basis.  Consider that she was at a crossroad after the death of her father, disgusted with being used as a sex object, spurned the related job offers, and was just looking for something legitimate a woman could do support herself.  While the prospects may have been limited in those days, her mentor did her no service in encouraging her to return to the area of her exploitation, turning it around to her ""benefit.""While the playing out of her manipulative rise was cleverly portrayed and makes fascinating viewing, one must be objective enough to note her anguish at the end about how she had to subvert her natural feelings to accrue her pile.  She finally makes a sound choice on her own to give it up for the far more satisfying intangibles, its compensation value having revealed itself as empty and unrewarding.

1018939,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B000I2JDF8,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[6, 8]","This is the first in what hopefully will become a regular series of pre-code films. All three films (Baby Face, Red-Headed Woman, and the first version of Waterloo Bridge) push the envelope in regard to their openly dealing with a variety of taboo subjects such as promiscuity, adultery, prostitution. And unlike later post-code films which obliquely tackled the same topics, for the most part the heroines in two of these movies really don't suffer and/or 'pay for their sins'.Let's start with Baby Face. This is probably the strongest entry or debateably a tie with Red-Headed Woman. Barbara Stanwyk is Lilly Powers, a quick whitted woman who wants to escape her drab (yet unsavory) past by sleeping her way up the social ladder. Stanwyk is just great as she chews up men on her quest for wealth and riches. She's cold and calculating, yet oddly sympathetic on a certain level. If you look closely, you'll even glimpse John Wayne in a incidental part as one of her co-workers.Red-Headed Woman is basically a variation of Baby Face. This time the protagonist is played very differently by the wonderful Jean Harlow at her comedic best. Harlow makes no attempt at subtlety and camps it up as the homewrecker from hell (or in this case the wrong side of the tracks).Undoubtedly, this is one of her best parts in spite of the fact that this film is often ignored. I'd have to describe her character as one really smart and calculating dumb blonde.The last offering Waterloo Bridge is the weakest entry. It is not nearly as interesting as the previous two pictures and lacks the comedic elements showcased in the former entries. Aside from an early screen appearance by Bette Davis in a supporting role, there is nothing that really distinguishes it as exceptional except its subject matter.Overall, I stand by my 5* rating since I found all films enjoyable.

1018942,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000I2JDF8,David Baldwin,"[5, 5]","These Pre-Code films are being touted for the frankness of the subject matter.  What I found interesting is despite the supposedly sordid material on display it seems that the makers were censoring themselves and only alluding to the most base behavior demonstrated by the films' ""heroines"".  For the most prurient among us there is no nudity or wanton displays of carnal knowledge.  As far as I'm concerned that's alright because in this age of anything goes some of our auteur's could use a little self-policing.  The best of the bunch is ""Baby Face"" where Barbara Stanwyck plays a down-and-outer who has been mistreated by men her whole life.  Directed to Nietzchean philosophy by a professorial type she learns how to exploit her feminine wiles in the corporate world and leaving casualties in her wake.  There's a certain morality in the end that some may take offense to but I found it to be satisfying.  ""Waterloo Bridge"" is a rather conventional love story between an American girl and a Canadian G.I.  What distinguishes the film is that the girl is a streetwalker and the makers make no bones about her profession.  A gritty film that could have been better if the principals, Mae Clarke and Kent Douglas, were better actors.  Check out the remake with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor even if it is a somewhat sanitized version.  The weakest film in the set I found to be is ""Red Headed Woman"".  Once again we find a girl from the wrong side of the tracks(Jean Harlow) attempting to sleep her way to the top despite the ancilliary damage she may cause.  The film suffers from a certain degree of staginess and incidental campiness.  Harlow, a gifted comedienne taken before her time, elevates the otherwise inert material.

1018947,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B000I2JDF8,Douglas M,"[154, 160]","The films of Pre-Code Hollywood (before 1934) have always held a special place in the history of Hollywood. The subjects were treated far more realistically than after the Code was imposed. This selection focuses on 3 films with 3 major central performances.""Baby Face"", starring a relentless Barbara Stanwyck, is a 1933 Warner Brothers film which traces the rise and rise of a tart. Stanwyck was quoted once as saying that the film was slated for her to give her glamour but that is the least of it. She is certainly dolled up but it is her tough realism that really makes the role as she leaves a trail of men in her path from poverty to riches. The early scenes in her father's speakeasy are particulary powerful. Look for a young John Wayne in the cast too. The DVD contains the recently discovered Director's Cut before the film was hacked by the Censors, so you really get to see what the fuss was about. It is interesting to observe how the cuts did not destroy the flow of the story. Part of the Censor's objections was that the heroine did not get her come-uppance so the tacked on ending in the cut version assures us that she ends up where she started, which was in fact ambiguous in the original version.""Red Headed Woman"" is probably Jean Harlow's toughest role, playing like Stanwyck a heartless tart who climbs her way to the top. Other actresses on the MGM payroll did not want the unsympathetic role but Harlow, with hair dyed from the trademark platinum blonde, has the requisite humour to put it over. Parts of the film are very funny with Una Merkel entertaining as Harlow's sidekick. The ending is hilarious  with no contrived retribution for our heroine. The film really helped put Harlow on top and type cast her in the public's mind even when MGM later softened her image.""Waterloo Bridge"" is the early Universal version of the MGM favorite, this time directed by James Whale. Film historians who have seen this version have always claimed it is far superior to the version starring Vivien Leigh in 1940 with a memorable performance by Mae Clarke. (By the way, that's Mae Clarke peeking out of the DVD Case). It is a treat to see and notable for a very early appearance of Bette Davis in a small supporting role. Compared to the MGM film, this version is much closer to the original play, both in script and the way it is filmed. It has a realism and sense of tragedy which is more moving than the glossy tearjerker from MGM.  Douglas Montgomery, as the soldier, is far more convincing than the starry Robert Taylor but you can see why it would never have been the box office bonanza the MGM version was - the difference between parsimonious Universal in 1931 and glamorous MGM in 1940.The DVD set contains trailers of ""Baby Face"" and ""Red Headed Woman"" and a cursory introduction by Robert Osborne. The film prints are fine given the age of the films. The worst is probably the released version of ""Baby Face"" but once you have picked up where the cuts were made, you may not view it again, so it doesn't matter.The package would have been improved with a suitable documentary about the significance of the films, if only because both ""Baby Face"" and ""Red Headed Woman"" explore some interesting ideas about the power of woman over men. In both films, men are the victims, in the former of Stanwyck's hatred and the latter Harlow's greed.

1018948,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000I2JDF8,Ed Uyeshima,"[23, 24]","Before the Hays Code neutralized the sexually oriented behavior that could be shown in Hollywood movies for three decades, there was a crop of movies that reflected a more laissez-faire attitude toward risqu&eacute; subjects like promiscuity, homosexuality and drug use. In what looks to be the first volume of an intriguing series, this two-disc DVD set from Turner Classic Movies contains three epochal works from that brief period that started with the talkie revolution and ended abruptly in 1934.The oldest of the trio, 1931's ""Waterloo Bridge"", is fairly typical of the pre-code genre and has only a fleeting similarity to the glamorous 1940 MGM version with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor.  Directed by James Whale before he peaked with ""Frankenstein"" and ""Showboat"", this film is set in WWI London and stars the long-forgotten Mae Clarke, an actress best known for being the recipient of James Cagney's grapefruit attack in ""The Public Enemy"". She plays Myra, an American chorus girl who turns to prostitution when her show closes. Unlike Leigh's ethereal ballerina in the later film, Clarke's Myra is all bitterness with a shaft of hope in the form of an American soldier named Roy, whom she accidentally meets during an air raid. He comes from a wealthy family who find out about her profession, which leads to the inevitable consequences. Clarke is solid as Myra, though she does go overboard in her breakdown scene. Kent Douglass is rather wooden as Roy, though he certainly captures the soldier's callow nature. Done on the cheap by Universal and at only 81 minutes, it's an interesting and sometimes poignant curio thanks mostly to Whale's dexterity with melodrama. A freshly scrubbed, 23-year old Bette Davis shows up in the inconsequential role of Roy's sister.In full hellcat mode even without her platinum blonde tresses, Jean Harlow has her breakthrough role starring in 1932's more comically oriented ""Red-Headed Woman"", an obvious MGM product given its high production values. She plays Lil Andrews, an unapologetic gold-digger who seduces her boss Bill Legendre and steals him away from his staid fianc&eacute;e Irene. Bored and tried of being looked down upon once they are married, she moves on to an older, wealthier man to ensnare but not before she tries to shoot her husband. But Lil's amoral behavior finds her being further rejected, especially when she is caught with a French chauffeur, played by a very young Charles Boyer with his trademark continental flair already established. For all the pain Lil causes to the other characters in the story, she ends up happily unrepentant in Paris, a fact which really defines this as a pre-code movie. At only 21, Harlow is already confident and brassy, even though Anita Loos' script has her teetering precariously between comedy and melodrama. Chester Morris is rather stiff as Bill, but Una Merkel shines as Lil's best friend Sally. Take note of the forthright way the camera lingers on Lil and Sally as they change in and out of their negligees.By far, the most interesting of the three films is 1933's ""Baby Face"", a hard-boiled Warner Brothers film starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck. A consummate master at portraying Machiavellian cool, a technique she perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"", Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, the well-worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel-town. She has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father's customers. Once her father dies in a distillery explosion, she hops a freight train to New York and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank. This would come across as preposterous were it not for Stanwyck's blazing work here. With her dead-eyed stare and amoral seduction methods, it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality. One of the young men she seduces along the way is a fresh-faced John Wayne as of all things, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama gets heavy-handed toward the last third of the film with a murder-suicide, a hush-hush job in Paris to keep Lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to Lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury. A tacked-on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before Stanwyck sears the screen. The film has curious touches like Lily's bonding friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality.The first disc contains ""Waterloo Bridge and ""Red Headed Woman"" with an introduction by Turner Classic Movies' Robert Osborne. The second disc has two versions of ""Baby Face"" - the original theatrical release version and the newly found, uncensored version, which includes seemingly minor edits and scene extensions that really make this an even more fascinating movie.",4,A Fascinating Trio of Pre-Code Hollywood Films Highlighted by Stanwyck's Blazing Performance,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,4936,"['Hays', 'Code',

1018949,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B000I2JDF8,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[2, 2]","We obtained this collection because we were curious to see films that were considered forbidden during the 1930's and it is interesting to realize what Hollywood gets away with today, vs. what was considered taboo in the early part of the 20th Century.To briefly remind ourselves of what the 30s was all about... the USA's population was 123 million people, living in 48 states with a life expectancy of 58 years for men and 61 for females. People were making an average salary of $1,400 and unemployment had risen to 25%. What once was known for the land of opportunity had become the land of desperation and Americans fell into the Great Depression. Rather than a society where people advanced in the natural progression of economic means, Americans experienced a time where survival became the keyword and while democracy prevailed, the attitude and lifestyle of many focused on climbing at whatever costs, to reach monetary power.Baby FaceBarbara Stanwyck is a favorite of ours, so we selected this movie as first in the collection, and were delighted to see a very young Stanwyck playing the part of a young woman who lives her life struggling to make ends meet by working for her despicable father, who attempts to ""sell"" her favors to his clients. A friend gives her books for her to develop her mind and he counsels her to learn the works of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche so she learns ""to use men"" to get herself out of the life she has and to move up until she reaches ""her potential.""So... she moves to New York City and ""uses men"" all the way to the top, climbing from floor to floor until she reaches the boardroom. At some point, she meets her match, a man that sees through her manipulation of men to acquire wealth, and astutely he turns it around, sending her to work at one of the bank's branches in Paris, France. They meet again and finally this woman finds love and marriage and is confronted with the perennial quandary: now she has much but must give it all up to save the man, whom for the first time in her life, inspires her to say ""I love you."" Excellent film.Red-Headed WomanJean Harlow performs as a young woman in search of fortune and she sets her eyes on the ""boss,"" played by Chester Morris. She takes the mail to his home and makes advances to him, so preposterous that it is sickening to watch. By now we were realizing that aside from these movies surfacing forbidden topics, such as undressing in front of the cameras, which is a mild exposure of arms and legs, or alluding to sexual scenes may have been seen as sinful, the topics were about men and how easily they fall pray to a woman willing to do anything for their money, power or protection.The main character is able to break her boss's marriage, destroying his family and happiness. As the plot thickens, she moves on to another wealthy older gentleman, but this time her new husband hires a private detective and soon has proof of her betrayal to both husband and lover, for while the older gentleman takes her out in style, she is also having an affair with his French chauffeur, played by Charles Boyer.The movie has a rather poignant subject for the times, it is interesting to watch, but the performances are a bit contrived.Waterloo BridgeThe final film in this collection is about a chorus girl played by Mae Clarke who is forced to walk the streets to make ends meet. A soldier played by Kent Douglass is the well to do man she has been looking for, but these are the times when a girl from the lowest class is not permitted to marry, however pure her intentions are, into a wealthy family.Frankly, it is remarkable how the movies of the 30s seem to have substance and tell stories that teach the consequences of our actions. While society was not yet as advanced as ours, the effort is worth seeing and enjoying.

Starring Barbara Stanwyck as Lilly ""Baby Face"" Palmer, a barmaid who decides to climb the social ladder by seducing every man who can open the doors for her on the way to the top. The film was submitted to the New York State Board of Censors for consideration. It was quickly rejected and soon banned across the United States for its explicit sexual innuendo. With some of its steamier scenes either cut or re-shot, and a new ending tacked on, it was finally released, still full of sexual innuendo. After the Production Code was enforced in 1934, the film, even in its censored version, was not allowed to be re-released. Amazingly enough, in 2004, a copy of the original, un-edited film was unearthed in the Library of Congress. After 70 years, the uncensored Baby Face finally received its public premiere at Film Forum in New York City on January 24th, 2005 and was subsequently released on DVD in the first volume of Warners' Forbidden Hollywood collection.Note the vhs of the same name is the censored theatrical version and not the 2004 discovered original 1933 version which appears here for the first time.",4,Stanwyck shines in newly found pre-code Hollywood,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,1196,"['Baby', 'Face', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'notorious', 'pre-Code', 'films', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'Starring', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Lilly', 'Baby', 'Face', 'Palmer', 'barmaid', 'who', 'climb', 'social', 'ladder', 'seducing', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'open', 'doors', 'way', 'top', 'film', 'was', 'submitted', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'Board', 'Censors', 'consideration', 'was', 'quickly', 'rejected', 'soon', 'banned', 'United', 'States', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'steamier', 'scenes', 'cut', 're-shot', 'new', 'ending', 'tacked', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'still', 'full', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'Production', 'Code', 'was', 'enforced', '1934', 'film', 'even', 'censored', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'be', 're-released', 'Amazingly', 'enough', '2004', 'copy', 'original', 'un-edited', 'film', 'was', 'unearthed', 'Library', 'Congress', '70', 'years', 'uncensored', 'Baby', 'Face', 'finally', 'received', 'public', 'premiere', 'Film', 'Forum', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'January', '24th', '2005', 'was', 'subsequently', 'released', 'DVD', 'first', 'volume', 'Warners', 'Forbidden', 'Hollywood', 'collection.Note', 'vhs', 'same', 'name', 'censored', 'theatrical', 'version', 'not', '2004', 'discovered', 'original', '1933', 'version', 'here', 'first', 'time']",TCM Archives: Forbidden Hollywood Collection - Volume One (Waterloo Bridge / Baby Face / Red-Headed Woman)

This is some good watching and is really harmless. I love vintage movies and I think this is some of Stanwyck's best acting next to my favorite picture of her's ""Stella Dallas"". All the different wierd reviews from others like there's not enough info presented on the disc with the movie.

1018954,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B000I2JDF8,J. Michael Click,"[318, 326]","There seems to be a great deal of pre-release confusion concerning what will actually be included on this upcoming set, and why.  In the interest of sorting things out, I should first point out that although this is the first ""Forbidden Hollywood"" collection to be released by Warner Home Video on DVD, the franchise itself is not new.  There were previously two ""Forbidden Hollywood"" boxed sets and a number of double features released on LaserDisc back in the 1990's.  Additionally, quite a few ""Forbidden Hollywood"" titles were also offered on VHS cassette.  From the git-go, ""Forbidden Hollywood"" titles were only culled from that cache of movies that premiered during the few short years after the introduction of ""talkies"" and the imposition of the Hays Production Code in 1934.During this time frame, roughly 1929 to mid-1934, Hollywood studio product became increasingly concerned with subject matter that would later be condemned as taboo after the Code came into effect; these so-called ""pre-Code talkies"" were filled with characters who indulged in premarital sex, extramarital affairs, and even gay and lesbian liaisons.  Films touched on hot-button topics such as rape, abortion, feminism, having children out-of-wedlock, drug abuse, and other social ills.  And mind you, these things weren't just delicately hinted at in screenplays ... they frequently were shown on-screen and discussed quite frankly.  After the Hays Code was adopted by the motion picture industry as a self-censorship tool, this group of films was deemed unacceptable for future distribution and exhibition without judicious editing to trim out now-objectionable material, and so they became, literally, ""Forbidden Hollywood"" product.This new two-disc DVD set will feature three titles, but four films, two of them extremely rare.  The first disc will include James Whale's 1931 ""Waterloo Bridge"", a film once thought ""lost"" and for the last 20 years only screened at film retrospectives (and apparently once or twice on TCM several years ago).  The 1940 remake starring Vivien Leigh, though a wonderful and deservedly beloved film, will not be included here since it is not from the pre-Code era, and was never suppressed as part of the ""Forbidden Hollywood"" catalogue.  Instead, the second film on this first disc will be the racy 1932 Jean Harlow vehicle, ""Red-Headed Woman"", which pushed the envelope back in the day for its bold depiction of a sexually free secretary who sets her sights on her married boss.The second disc will include two versions of a single film, the 1933 scorcher ""Baby Face"", starring Barbara Stanwyck as a blonde bombshell who - after being pimped out by her father in her own hometown - moves to New York and sleeps her way up the corporate ladder to the very top.  Many film historians point to ""Baby Face"" as the single film most responsible for the introduction of the Hays Code, the one that ushered in an era of censorship that was to last for more than 30 years.  Intriguingly, the version that so shocked the public was actually an edited version of the original cut, which then disappeared for over 70 years ... until a complete print was found, restored, and finally premiered on the revival circuit in early 2006.  That long-awaited, long-sought original version will be included on this set, as will be the edited version that managed to cause such an uproar when it played theatres in 1933.And there you have it, the official contents of the ""Forbidden Hollywood Collection, Volume One"", enough to have a large number of pre-Code devotees jumping for joy at the chance to finally see (and own!) some seldom-displayed jewels.

There's Jean Harlow as Lil in  Red Headed Women & Barbara Stanwyck as Lily in Baby-Face, the movie with the famous song of the same name. Mae Clark as Myra, trolling for men off of Waterloo Bridge, completes this trio of trollops. She is out of the running simply because she's lovable & sympathetic as a World War I hooker in London, trying to keep it together. She actually falls in love with a GI. I give it by a lovely nose to Barbara. The movie is simply better & made better. At this point, she is a better actress that Jean. Lily's been damaged by her barkeep father who pimps her out in steel town. He dies in a fire that burns the saloon down & she heads for NYC. There she selects a high rise bank & goes to work. She has a plan. It's simple. Use sex to work her way up the corporate ladder. She disposes of a young, love-struck John Wayne early on. There is a long list of leading men & I'm sorry I lost count & track. But she works her way thru lots of men discarding each as she moves up the hierarchy. Men die & kill for her. She doesn't appear  to like sex that much, only to use it. Rich & notorious, she reaches the top & marries the CEO. But the company is headed for the rocks & her husband is broke & in trouble with the law. She is rich & at first refuses to help. He shoots himself. At this point, she suddenly realizes that she loves this man. That should be the end of the movie, Lily wallowing in the grief she deserves. But the brains at Warner couldn't leave it alone. They tagged another ending on it. Lily's husband recovers from a bullet in the head & they return to poverty & happiness in steeltown. Stanwyck did not appear in that scene. which was obviously shot later. There's a little S&M in Red Headed Women if that's your taste but Baby-Face is still slightly better.

Harris ""terlat""","[25, 29]","I too have waited a long time to see the Pre-Code films on DVD, but this Warners release is part of the continuing saga from this company to shortchange its fans.  The quality of Red-Headed Woman is lousy, worse than the prints I've seen and taped from TCM.  Apparently there's someone new overseeing the vaults for TCM/Warners because there's no real attempt to remaster these films properly.  The mislabeling of discs also shows poor quality control.The pluses are the very good prints of Waterloo Bridge and Baby Face, especially the newly-discovered ""pre-release"" version, which makes more sense than the second version, especially considering the fairly ambiguous ending that doesn't include the obligatory punishment scene censors demanded.For any of you who are not yet initiated into the fan club of scholars who love the Pre-Code era, this is still a must-have set.  The era was really the only one in the history of film that gave women the Nietsche-like ""Power"" Barbara Stanwyck's friend in Baby Face told her she owns over men.  The period from 1930-1934 was rare in that it featured radical stories with women leads who subverted the patriarchal society by using their sexuality one skyscraper floor at a time. The pretense was the exhibitors' desire for as many ""women's pictures"" as possible; box office was down significantly at the start of the Depression and theatre managers rightfully claimed that 75% of their audience was female.  In downtown cities they shopped whenever they could, met each other for lunch, and sometimes hopped from one theater to the other.  Hollywood responded by taking advantage of the lax censorship at the time, but when the industry's greatest fear faced them in 1934--the threat of censorship from the New Deal--the studios caved. (See the publication Variety from this era.)  No wonder feminist theorists have written so much about this era.Now, two more negatives before I end this basically downbeat review:  No extras--where's the documentary ""Complicated Women"" or other commentaries?  How about the price, $39.95 for just three films with a short running time, when the box set would have been more reasonably priced at $30 list.  Come on, folks, let's rally for better quality, more films, extras, and reasonable prices for future box sets.

I had heard of a couple vaguely but had never really paid much attention to finding them.  I enjoyed them all.  Red Headed Woman has Harlow as hussy of the worst persuasion yet she triumphs over everyone.  Waterloo Bridge is a very nice story. It is not romantic as the Vivien Leigh/ Robert Taylor version but very good with a shocking ending.  No it isn't Anna Karenina style.  My favorite which is available in two version here is Baby Face.  Barbara Stanwyck shows that she was a top notch actress from the start.  One of the great screen actresses of all time.  She is another gold digger like Jean Harlow but reads Nietzsche for pleasure reading and enlightenment.  Her life is more well developed as is her character.  Her black friend becomes her maid.  The two versions are definitely a requirement to view preferably one after another.  You have to watch them all the way through too!  You will love it!

1018964,A1GF7BR6K22GZD,B000I2JDF8,Mark Norvell,"[12, 12]","Wow. This collection is a real treasure and worth every penny.  Three Pre-Code films with en extra print of 1933's ""Baby Face"" before it was cut. The prints look great with only some mid-film scratching on, I think, 1932's ""Red Headed Woman"" but it doesn't last and doesn't distract. They look good because great care was taken to preserve them and obviously they are of historical significance. ""Baby Face"" is very adult with Barbara Stanwyck ""sleeping"" her way up a huge New York skyscraper but frankly she saves the ""sleeping"" for the bigger game at the top. It's more like ""quickies"" on the way up. And she's tough as nails and gives a very entertaining performance. You can tell the parts that were censored because they're more than a little frank. Now, ""Red Headed Woman"" allows Jean Harlow to play an out and out floozy who's literally manic to marry her already married boss. A young Una Merkel ( who later became a fine character actress) is funny as her gal pal who gets a kick out of Harlow's carrying on. But then it gets pretty serious as Harlow goes over the top when her trashiness catches up with her. Pretty bizarre film really but worth it to watch Harlow. But for me, the real find is James Whale's ""Waterloo Bridge"". His ""Frankenstein"" star Mae Clarke plays a world-weary prostitute who falls in love with a 19 yr.old soldier in London WW1. It's a good story (with Bette Davis in a small role) and not at all worthy of censorship. Yes, it's frank and adult but not played at all for sensationalism. Clarke is excellent and should have been a bigger star. It's atmospheric and beautifully made and you can see the Whale genius at work here. Very, very good.

1018965,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B000I2JDF8,mrliteral,"[0, 1]","There are many gripes about older movies that I consider rather lame:  they aren't in color, the special effects are not that great, etc.  There is, however, one complaint that is somewhat legitimate, and that is how some movies were watered down due to the Production Code.  At its peak, the Code would keep films as far away from reality as possible:  violence would be bloodless, husbands and wives would sleep in separate beds and authority figures (such as policemen) were beyond corruption (except for the occasional politician).  Of course, the best directors and writers knew how to cleverly dance around the Code, but many other movies were utterly tame when depicting crime or romance.Forbidden Hollywood Volume One is a collection of three movies made before the Production Code was in full force.  Although mild by today's standards, they were much grittier than anything that would come out just a few years later.  In addition, they happen to be good movies.Jean Harlow is the title character in Red-Headed Woman, a secretary with ambitions to seduce her boss.  She eventually succeeds in ruining his marriage, but she still aspires to loftier stations in life.  It's something of a commentary on class, with the lesson being that when a woman comes from the wrong side of the tracks, no amount of jewels or furs can redeem her.  Not the most politically correct message, but the movie is decent enough.Waterloo Bridge is actually a remake that would be remade again in later years.  The star here is Mae Clarke, most well-known for being Elizabeth in Frankenstein (the Karloff version) and having a grapefruit shoved in her face by James Cagney in The Public Enemy.  In this movie, she is a showgirl turned prostitute who falls for an American soldier while living in WWI London.  In a reversal of Red-Headed Woman, she keeps pushing the man away because she doesn't consider herself worthy of his attentions.  This film was directed by James Whale (who did such films as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein and The Invisible Man) and is pretty good until the last scene which seems tacked on and provides an unnecessary twist.Finally, Baby Face has Barbara Stanwyck as the daughter of a speakeasy owner who sleeps her way (actually, there isn't much sleeping involved) to New York and to great wealth, using men along the way (including a young John Wayne as an accountant!).  The DVD for this movie has two versions:  the original theatrical release and a recently discovered earlier version with additional scenes that were obviously too risque even for the pre-Code era.There aren't much extras with this set, but based on the quality of the movies themselves, this set merits four stars.  If you think that all old movies are as daring as tepid water, this is a good opportunity to see that there was a time when movies took a bit of a chance.",4,When things were risque,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,2863,"['are', 'many', 'gripes', 'older', 'movies', 'consider', 'rather', 'lame', 'are', ""n't"", 'color', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'etc', 'however', 'one', 'complaint', 'somewhat', 'legitimate', 'how', 'movies', 'were', 'watered', 'down', 'due', 'Production', 'Code', 'peak', 'Code', 'would', 'keep', 'films', 'far', 'away', 'reality', 'possible', 'violence', 'would', 'be', 'bloodless', 'husbands', 'wives', 'would', 'sleep', 'separate', 'beds', 'authority', 'figures', 'such', 'policemen', 'were', 'corruption', 'occasional', 'politician', 'course', 'best', 'directors', 'writers', 'knew', 'how', 'cleverly', 'dance', 'Code', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'utterly', 'tame', 'when', 'depicting', 'crime', 'romance.Forbidden', 'Hollywood', 'Volume', 'One', 'collection', 'three', 'movies', 'made', 'Production', 'Code', 'was', 'full', 'force', 'mild', 'today', 'standards', 'were', 'much', 'grittier', 'anything', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'addition', 'happen', 'be', 'good', 'movies.Jean', 'Harlow', 'title', 'character', 'Red-Headed', 'Woman', 'secretary', 'ambitions', 'seduce', 'boss', 'eventually', 'ruining', 'marriage', 'still', 'loftier', 'stations', 'life', 'something', 'commentary', 'class', 'lesson', 'being', 'when', 'woman', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'amount', 'jewels', 'furs', 'can', 'redeem', 'Not', 'most', 'politically', 'correct', 'message', 'movie', 'decent', 'enough.Waterloo', 'Bridge', 'actually', 'remake', 'would', 'be', 'remade', 'again', 'later', 'years', 'star', 'here', 'Mae', 'Clarke', 'most', 'well-known', 'being', 'Elizabeth', 'Frankenstein', 'Karloff', 'version', 'having', 'grapefruit', 'shoved', 'face', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'movie', 'showgirl', 'turned', 'prostitute', 'who', 'American', 'soldier', 'living', 'WWI', 'London', 'reversal', 'Red-Headed', 'Woman', 'pushing', 'man', 'away', ""n't"", 'consider', 'worthy', 'attentions', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'James', 'Whale', 'who', 'did', 'such', 'films', 'Frankenstein', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'pretty', 'good', 'last', 'scene', 'tacked', 'unnecessary', 'twist.Finally', 'Baby', 'Face', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'daughter', 'speakeasy', 'owner', 'who', 'way', 'actually', ""n't"", 'much', 'sleeping', 'involved', 'New', 'York', 'great', 'wealth', 'using', 'men', 'way', 'including', 'young', 'John', 'Wayne', 'accountant', 'DVD', 'movie', 'two', 'versions', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'recently', 'discovered', 'earlier', 'version', 'additional', 'scenes', 'were', 'obviously', 'too', 'risque', 'even', 'pre-Code', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'extras', 'set', 'based', 'quality', 'movies', 'set', 'four', 'stars', 'think', 'old', 'movies', 'are', 'as', 'daring', 'tepid', 'water', 'good', 'opportunity', 'see', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'took', 'bit', 'chance']",TCM Archives: Forbidden Hollywood Collection - Volume One (Waterloo Bridge / Baby Face / Red-Headed Woman)

Green's &lt;em>Baby Face&lt;/em> was one of a string of early-thirties blockbusters--&lt;em>The Bitter Tea of General Yen&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Night Nurse&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>Forbidden&lt;/em> among them--that turned a young actress named Barbara Stanwyck into a pre-code sensation, the wet dream of every straight American male born between the turn of the century and World War I. Ironically, however, the full film would not premiere in America for seventy-two years; despite having been submitted for release a few whiskers before the Hays Code shut its iron jaws, all but stopping American innovation in film for some thirty-four years, it was trashed by the New York Board of Censors, and five minutes of the film was cut prior to its 1933 release. At the time, it was considered one of the most &lt;em>outre&lt;/em> films ever made. (Needless to say, at its July 20, 2005 premiere, had it been rated, it would have barely made a PG.)We start off with an escort, Lily Powers (Stanwyck), trying to get out of the business. (The first thing the New York censors found objectionable: her father was her pimp, and early in the film she spews a wonderful monologue blaming him for, well, everything from the bubonic plague to the heartbreak of psoriasis.) She runs away with her best friend, Chico (&lt;em>Jezebel&lt;/em>'s Theresa Harris in an early example of the Best Black Friend role[link removed for Amazon consumption]), to the city. And when she finds out life there is harder than she thought it was going to be, daddy's little girl comes out to play. After all, men generally think with the other head, right?NOTE: the following paragraph contains spoilers.But what &lt;em>really&lt;/em> got down the blouses of the censorship committee was that, in essence, she got away with it. (Ironically, the ending reshot for the censors has her getting away with it more, if anything; the original ending gives her a much starker lesson to reflect upon.) Good girls don't [censored for Amazon consumption] their way to the top and get away with it. Of course, good girls don't get pimped out by their fathers or dally with the hired help (there is still some debate on whether that's actually there or not) either. So the censors chop, chop, chop away and what do we end up with? A woman who [censored for Amazon consumption] her way to the top not because of her dysfunctional home life, but because &lt;em>she wants to&lt;/em>, pretty much. How is that closer to code than giving her a reason? I dunno, but the moral of the story is this: ignore the censored version for anything but comparison purposes. The original cut is now widely available. It's more coherent, Stanwyck's character has greater depth, and it's got more of a flow to it.

The male lead is also great.The main reason for packages like this is to not just see some films you probably have not seen before, but to reconsider an aspect of film history. These movies make a compelling argument that the Hays Office, and the subsequent age of repression was also a patriarchal reassertion (even if secondarily).

The series featured movies made before there were strict rules placed on what was and was not considered decent in movies, many of them with shocking and very modern subjects including sex, drugs, and crime. This is the first DVD release of that series, two previously released films and a new one.Let us start with Baby Face, perhaps the most shocking of all pre-code films. We have two versions here, the uncut version and the one that was released to the public. The uncut version features less than ten minutes of new footage throughout the film. It is difficult to recognize all of it because none of it disrupts the flow of the film. The story is about Barbara Stanwyck, a woman who was pimped out by her father to the drunken men who visited their illegal saloon. She has hardened herself to men, and when her father dies, she sets her sights on a large office building and sleeps her way to the top. This might sound dull, especially since this subject is not uncommon in modern films, but Stanwyck's likability and boldness make for a wonderful movie, one you can watch over and over. Watch for an early appearance by John Wayne.Next we have Red Headed Woman, a film starring platinum blonde Jean Harlow with a dye job. Her character is similar to that in Baby Face, but she's much classier in a beautiful wardrobe. Lil schemes her way into the arms of a married man and does all she can to turn his life upside down. She moves from man to man with no regard for her reputation or the dignity of the men she ruins. Although she's an evil character, we somehow enjoy the ride anyway. Also appearing is Una Merkel as Lil's loyal friend.Last is a new release, Waterloo Bridge. Mae Clarke plays a chorus girl turned prostitute who meets up with an innocent soldier on leave (Kent Douglass). The two fall in love but she cannot marry him because of her previous life. Clarke's acting is brilliant, subtle, but incredibly telling of her abilities. She seems much more beautiful here than in any other film. This version is vastly different from subsequent re-makes and stands tall on its own. Also appearing is a young Bette Davis in an early role.Unfortunately, manufacturers made a mistake when labeling the disks. Disk one has photos of Harlow and Clarke but features both versions of Baby Face. Disk two has a photo of Stanwyck but holds the other two movies and the introduction by Robert Osbourne.All in all, this DVD release is fantastic.

1018978,A2P1TDEWO0PPX3,B000I2JDF8,Temple Meade,"[9, 10]","These movies are outstanding in many ways, but in two especially. First they let us know that our grandparents and parents had just as many conflicts with romance, love and sexual congress as we do. Second, they may help to bring recognition to two largely forgotten actresses, Jean Harlow and Mae Clarke.A few days ago, after watching China Seas with a friend he asked me, ""what is the whole Harlow Legend about"" I told him to watch Red Dust, or better still Red Headed Woman. In her early movies Jean was young healthy and full of sass. In her later films as illness overtook her the light was gone. Miss Harlow was always best in comedy. The dramatic roles assigned to her were generally so one dimensional that no actress could have made anything of them. Red Headed Woman is a comedy and Jean sparkles. The movie was a 'succes de scandale' in 1932 and audiences were laughing despite themselves. The kind of raw-naked ambition Jean gives Lill has now become so familiar to us that some people may not get the point. Please bear in mind that in 1932 girls like Lill could not have careers in Law or Politics. Remember, this is a comedy.Mention Mae Clark and if people know who you are talking about they will probably recall Jimmy Cagney and the grapefruit. There was so much more and Waterloo Bridge will introduce you to it. Miss Clarke as Myra Deauville is always genuine in a role that could easily become maudlin, cloying and artificial.

1018979,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000I2JDF8,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[8, 10]","This collection of three pre-code Hollywood dramas provides an interesting glimpse into what Hollywood could get away with before the Hays Code began censoring films. The ""Code"" turned films from more adult interesting fare into something that inhabited a fantasy world of separate beds for married couples forcing film writers, producers and directors from shying away from more adult themes. It impacted films for both good ( by preventing more exploitative films) and bad giving birth to the absurd ratings system that we have today (how does a film get a PG to a PG-13 it has to do with the use of the ""f"" word and it's relationship with sex splitting films into different categories based on semantics a lot of times). While I recognize that ratings are essential to helping parents maintain control of what their children see, it also has become a nearly meaningless marketing advantage (if want to turn a film into a marketing wonder make sure it doesn't have a ""G"" rating) or stigma that haunts the industry even today (for more info on this see the forthcoming ""This Film Has Not Been Rated"").Warner and TMC have combined forces for this look into pre-code Hollywood with a trio of films that would have (or did in one case) suffer at the hands of censors that used a hatchet to remove subtly from many Hollywood films. The first film in this collection ""Waterloo Bridge"" was the second film (although this was the third film he worked on. Whale also worked uncredited on Howard Hawks' ""Hell's Angels"") to be directed by James Whale (""Frankenstein"", ""The Old Dark House"", ""The Bride of Frankenstein""). Based on the play by Robert E. Sherwood this film is deftly directed which is a surprise given how early this was in both Whale's career and in the history of talkies. Mae Clarke plays Myra a streetwalker who falls for Roy (Douglass Montgomery) a Canadian solider stationed in London who doesn't realize that she's a hooker when he falls in love with her. After Roy proposes Myra runs out on him believing that her sordid past will destroy any chance of happiness for them.Well acted and directed it's clear why Whale's early films caught on with the public-he has a natural flair as a film director even though his background was in stage directing. The film was later remade in a sanitized version by MGM in 1940. The studio purchased the rights to the original (to take it out of circulation as well as to own all versions of the story) which is why this neglected minor classic has been out of circulation for so long. As a long time fan of Whale's work I have been trying to catch this film for years and always just managed to miss it when it would occasionally be allowed out of the vault. Keep in mind the time when the film was made; the camera isn't as nimble as it would be within a year or two as the camera often had to be encased in a booth to prevent its sounds from being picked up by the sound equipment!Also included is ""Red Headed Woman"" a 1932 film starring Gene Harlow, Lewis Stone and Charles Boyer. Directed by Jack Conway and adapted by Anita Loos from a novel by Kate Brush, Harlow is cast as Lillian a lady who will do anything to land a wealthy husband. She picks out Bill (Chester Morris) a man already happily married and damages his married to Irene (Leila Hyams). After Bill gets divorced he marries Lillian but she never gains acceptance by his wealthy friends. She schemes to seduce a wealthy friend of Bill's and later blackmail him.Yikes! Harlow looks terrific in this film a film that's too revealing by standards that would be instituted in less than two years. ""Red-Headed Woman"" pulls every clich&eacute; out of the drawer regarding ""fast"" women. There's a brief glimpse of nudity in the film.Slightly better is ""Baby Face"" a film that put the bubbles into soap opera. Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily (what's with all the women named Lily or Lillian? What did MGM have against that name?) a girl who runs away from home and finds a job at a bank in the big city by sleeping with the first employer she runs across. She uses the ""stepping stones"" to success working her way up the corporate ladder. When a thwarted lover takes matters into his own hands and murders the latest in Lily's line of succession, things become a bit complicated for the ""Baby Face"".Unlike ""Red-Headed Woman"" which features a brief section of nudity(!), ""Baby Face"" plays the story pretty straight even if sex seems to drive everything in the film. Unlike a lot of code films Lily isn't punished for her deeds. It's a fascinating film of the period with breezy pacing (for the time) and an early appearance by a young John Wayne. ***The film is presented in its original uncut glory and then in a version that the studio recut to make it more acceptable to code standards. With a bit of dialogue here, the right cut there the film appeared to be a bit more ""moral"" when compared to the original version. I'm surprised that the uncut version survives in any form as most films of the era that were altered are available only in their butchered re-edited versions. ---""Forbidden Hollywood"" looks quite good in this transfer. The version I received had the titles on the discs mixed up but other than that (a pretty minor issue), the transfer looks quite good with nice, clean presentations and solid mono sound. The uncut version of ""Baby Face"" looks slightly better than the final version of the film. I suspect its because the uncut version of the film was probably never released or only had a limited release.While I'm happy to see these films released with nice transfers I would have loved to see more extensive extras included. We get a brief introduction by Robert Osborne and the trailer for ""Baby Face"" but no commentary tracks which would have been useful particularly given the issues that came to exist after these films were released and a discussion of the Hays Code, it's impact on Hollywood, etc.According to a recent discussion at The Digital Bits HTF, the set was originally supposed to have a documentary on the pre-code films but Warner ran into clearence issues. However, volume 2 will have six films and a documentary on this era to make up for it.Three pre-code films one of them presented in ""before"" and ""after"" edits make this an essential purchase for fans of vintage Hollywood cinema. James Whale's ""Waterloo Bridge"" is my personal favorite but I'm biased towards even Whale's lesser efforts. All three films are quite good with ""Red-Headed Woman"" the weakest of the bunch even with the brief nudity evident in the film.",4,"A solid collection of classic pre-code films that could use
