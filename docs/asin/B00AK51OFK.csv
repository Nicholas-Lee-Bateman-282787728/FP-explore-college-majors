It goes back to the 40s and 50s when the valley was filled with orchards and takes us from then to now. It focuses particularly on Robert Noyce and eight other engineers who left Shockley Semiconductor to start their own company. They started Fairchild Semiconductor and created the work environment they wanted, one that acknowledged and appreciated the input of everyone. Eventually, these engineers would split up and start other companies and the expanse of the tech industry began. Noyce was one of the engineers responsible for developing the silicon chip which the valley became known for.

1612688,A2CZ953EHLEXWB,B00AK51OFK,Old Gray Moose,"[6, 6]","So much of Tech History is focused on Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, but without the revolutionary steps in computer HW design from 1957 to 1971 neither of them would have had the computing HW available to bring computers ""to the masses"". This documentary covers how a crack team of bright young engineers, mathematicians, and physicists (mostly from Bell Labs) started with big clunky computers based on discrete transistors literally ""wired"" together, to printed circuit boards, and finally the invention of the single chip microprocessor. And all this evolution happened in just 14 years!!! Also revealed are the origins of Fairchild and INTEL (as well as dozens of famous spinoffs) as these companies were the incubators for this revolutionary new technology. A fascinating film that reveals the names of the lost heroes of the Tech revolution. Robert Noyce is not a household name like Gates and Jobs, but he should be. He was to the development of modern computing HW, what Robert Oppenheimer was to development of the atomic bomb. Also interesting that both would not have been possible without DoD/NASA funding.This film should be required viewing for all electrical engineers, computer engineers, and IT professionals. The tech revolution changed the world. Gates/Jobs are only the 2nd half of that story.
