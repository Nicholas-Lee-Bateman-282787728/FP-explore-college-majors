Usually, this results in ill wrought PC crap like Spike Lee's 1989 fantasy, Do The Right Thing. Instead, they crafted an improvisational workshop concoction called Everyday People, about the closing of a fictive Jewish deli and restaurant called Raskin's in the heart of Brooklyn. And, the truth is, it's not a bad film. Is it great? No. Is it in a league with such classic New York films as Manhattan or My Dinner With Andre? No. But it is Do The Right Thing admixed with last year's Oscar winner, Crash; except that it's better written. Yes, it is a film filled with vignettes, and some don't work, but about three quarters of them work well enough for me to recommend the film.... My only lament over Everyday People is that the scenes that do not work, which get a little too speechy and preachy, seem to have come, from McKay's own admission, the improv process. Any artist has to have a real vision of their art. Without it, it gets ungainly and formless, which mars parts of this film. A better screenwriter could have tightened this film up into something excellent, perhaps even great, rather than merely being good. Nonetheless, when it is good, the film is quite good, and much better than Do The Right Thing or Crash. Sometimes, especially when you just want to relax and watch a `little' movie- one sans graphic sex and/or violence, that's more than enough.",3,Solid,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,1460,"['2004', 'HBO', 'Films', 'decided', 'try', 'hand', 'polemical', 'subject', 'race', 'New', 'York', 'Usually', 'results', 'ill', 'wrought', 'PC', 'crap', 'Spike', 'Lee', '1989', 'fantasy', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Instead', 'crafted', 'improvisational', 'workshop', 'concoction', 'called', 'Everyday', 'People', 'closing', 'fictive', 'Jewish', 'deli', 'restaurant', 'called', 'Raskin', 'heart', 'Brooklyn', 'truth', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'great', 'league', 'such', 'classic', 'New', 'York', 'films', 'Manhattan', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'No', 'Right', 'Thing', 'admixed', 'last', 'year', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Crash', 'better', 'written', 'Yes', 'film', 'filled', 'vignettes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'three', 'quarters', 'work', 'well', 'enough', 'recommend', 'film', 'only', 'lament', 'Everyday', 'People', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'speechy', 'preachy', 'seem', 'have', 'come', 'McKay', 'own', 'admission', 'improv', 'process', 'artist', 'have', 'real', 'vision', 'art', 'ungainly', 'formless', 'parts', 'film', 'better', 'screenwriter', 'could', 'have', 'tightened', 'film', 'up', 'something', 'excellent', 'perhaps', 'even', 'great', 'rather', 'merely', 'being', 'good', 'Nonetheless', 'when', 'good', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'much', 'better', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Crash', 'Sometimes', 'especially', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'relax', 'watch', 'little', 'movie-', 'one', 'graphic', 'sex', 'and/or', 'violence', 'more', 'enough']",N/A

The movie was shot in a famous restaurant I use to eat in which closed it's door before the film was made. I would like to see Everyday People on The Broadway stage as a play. Powerful movie about everyday people and the lose in their lives. Another play that come into my mind is The Ice Man Cometh, another O&#34;Neil play.

The answer is a bit simpler than I usually expect and a bit more complex too.  It is about a diner located in Brooklyn which is undergoing gentrification.  The owners of the diner are expected to sell out to some corporate giants such as Banana Republic and Hard Rock Cafe.  The area is run down and has been going down for a long time.  The working class people who frequent the restaurant and work there are just on the cusp of poverty.  Their lives aren't the greatest, but there is no promise that the area will allow them to better their lives.  The diner is a symbol of some stability and safety.  The script was written after several practices in repretory theatre.  The acting is terrific and very enjoyable to watch.  I found that the movie grew on me with repeated viewings.  There is always another layer to uncover.  A very nice movie and well worth a viewer's time.",5,Grows on You with Repeated Viewings,1169769600,"01 26, 2007",2007,990,"['found', 'movie', 'be', 'bit', 'off', 'putting', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'what', 'movie', 'asked', 'answer', 'bit', 'simpler', 'usually', 'expect', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'too', 'diner', 'located', 'Brooklyn', 'undergoing', 'gentrification', 'owners', 'diner', 'are', 'expected', 'sell', 'out', 'corporate', 'giants', 'such', 'Banana', 'Republic', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Cafe', 'area', 'run', 'down', 'been', 'going', 'down', 'long', 'time', 'working', 'class', 'people', 'who', 'frequent', 'restaurant', 'work', 'there', 'are', 'just', 'cusp', 'poverty', 'lives', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'promise', 'area', 'will', 'allow', 'better', 'lives', 'diner', 'symbol', 'stability', 'safety', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'several', 'practices', 'repretory', 'theatre', 'acting', 'terrific', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'found', 'movie', 'grew', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'always', 'layer', 'uncover', 'very', 'nice', 'movie', 'well', 'viewer', 'time']",N/A
862585,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B00067BCAO,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[0, 0]","This is not your everyday movie. With a story to tell about the closing of a Brooklyn restaurant, it resembles a documentary in its structure - more a slice-of-life complexity of situations than the usual plot-driven story line with a beginning-middle-end in that order. Artistically the camera seems to catch the action on the fly, and instead of 2-3 central characters, there is a large ensemble, each person with his own particular conflict to resolve. Some scenes play out between people whose differences have you cheering first for one side and then the other. A mother, for instance, berates her poetry-writing daughter for not aspiring to a corporate job like she herself has. Each is right in her own way.Set in a racially mixed Brooklyn neighborhood, the film also wants to open up the subject of race relations and racial identity. Not limited to differences between blacks and whites, it explores different points of view among its African-American characters. A business-suited professional carrying his cup of Starbucks objects to the assumptions of a man selling black ribbons on the street for young black males who are victims of prejudice. Later, each of them has his own unsettling encounter with some of those same young black males.As the director and producer explain in the commentary, much of the content of the film was developed in workshops with the actors, and thus, like documentary, the final cut is the result of considerable editing. It would have been nice for the DVD to include another 30-45 minutes of these out-takes. A party of MTA workers is glimpsed in some scenes, for instance, and it would have been interesting to get their story. The commentary also points out the painstaking efforts to capture the ambiance of New York itself - things you don't notice in a single screening: the street scenes visible outside the front windows and the reflections in the display cases of passing traffic and pedestrians. Altogether it is a fine film, up to the standards of HBO, and well worth seeing more than once.",5,A day in the life . . .,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,2046,"['not', 'everyday', 'movie', 'story', 'tell', 'closing', 'Brooklyn', 'restaurant', 'documentary', 'structure', 'more', 'slice-of-life', 'complexity', 'situations', 'usual', 'plot-driven', 'story', 'line', 'beginning-middle-end', 'order', 'Artistically', 'camera', 'catch', 'action', 'fly', 'instead', '2-3', 'central', 'characters', 'large', 'ensemble', 'person', 'own', 'particular', 'conflict', 'resolve', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'people', 'differences', 'have', 'cheering', 'first', 'one', 'side', 'then', 'other', 'mother', 'instance', 'poetry-writing', 'daughter', 'not', 'aspiring', 'corporate', 'job', 'right', 'own', 'way.Set', 'racially', 'mixed', 'Brooklyn', 'neighborhood', 'film', 'also', 'open', 'up', 'subject', 'race', 'relations', 'racial', 'identity', 'Not', 'limited', 'differences', 'blacks', 'whites', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'African-American', 'characters', 'business-suited', 'professional', 'carrying', 'cup', 'Starbucks', 'objects', 'assumptions', 'man', 'selling', 'black', 'ribbons', 'street', 'young', 'black', 'males', 'who', 'are', 'victims', 'prejudice', 'Later', 'own', 'unsettling', 'encounter', 'same', 'young', 'black', 'males.As', 'director', 'producer', 'explain', 'commentary', 'much', 'content', 'film', 'was', 'developed', 'workshops', 'actors', 'thus', 'documentary', 'final', 'cut', 'result', 'considerable', 'editing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'DVD', 'include', '30-45', 'minutes', 'out-takes', 'A', 'party', 'MTA', 'workers', 'glimpsed', 'scenes', 'instance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'get', 'story', 'commentary', 'also', 'out', 'painstaking', 'efforts', 'capture', 'ambiance', 'New', 'York', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'single', 'screening', 'street', 'scenes', 'visible', 'front', 'windows', 'reflections', 'display', 'cases', 'passing', 'traffic', 'pedestrians', 'fine', 'film', 'up', 'standards', 'HBO', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'once']",N/A
