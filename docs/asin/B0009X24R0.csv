This is just superb on every level.  I have the old Bolshoi production which was filmed on a soundstage.  Try as they might, they couldn't bring the soundtrack up to modern expectations.  The laser disc version came close.  I was thrilled to see this new 1990 production on DVD with sound as spectacular as the dancing.  The music of this ballet can stand alone.  I have it on CD.  It's one of the best works by Khachaturian.  Add the fantastic dancers and colorful sets and you've got a dynamite production.

915204,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B0009X24R0,David Bower,"[3, 3]","My review will focus on the ballet as my copy of this performance is on LaserDisc, not DVD. I have owned my copy of this performance for many years and always delight in playing it again. I have found this performance to combine beauty and excitement from its dramatic beginning all the way through. The music is beautiful and the dancing is both dramatic and beautiful.Irek Mukhamedov dances the role of Spartacus with great energy and makes it easy to understand his popularity at this time. If my information is correct, this is one of the last performances he did for the Bolshoi before leaving to join the Royal Ballet in London. Alexander Vetrov dances a very threatening Crassus and joins with Mukhamedov in turning in a powerful performance.Both women's leads, Phrygia, the wife of Spartacus, danced by Lyudmila Semenyaka, and  Aegina, the mistress of Crassus,  danced by Maria Bilova, are well danced by these two fine ballerinas.For me the music is one of the major attractions to this ballet and the music is very well performed by the Bolshoi orchestra. Another feature is the corps de ballet. Spartacus requires a large number of men dancers and the Bolshoi can provide all of the men dancers needed. The icing on the cake here is both the men and women dancers do outstanding jobs.All told this is a very rewarding ballet experience; if you're a fan of ballet, especially if you appreciate the music of Khachaturian, you'll enjoy this ballet performance.",5,A Beautiful and Exciting Ballet Experience,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,1468,"['review', 'will', 'focus', 'ballet', 'copy', 'performance', 'LaserDisc', 'not', 'DVD', 'have', 'owned', 'copy', 'performance', 'many', 'years', 'always', 'delight', 'playing', 'again', 'have', 'found', 'performance', 'combine', 'beauty', 'excitement', 'dramatic', 'beginning', 'way', 'music', 'beautiful', 'dancing', 'dramatic', 'beautiful.Irek', 'Mukhamedov', 'role', 'Spartacus', 'great', 'energy', 'easy', 'understand', 'popularity', 'time', 'information', 'correct', 'one', 'last', 'performances', 'did', 'Bolshoi', 'leaving', 'join', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'London', 'Alexander', 'Vetrov', 'very', 'threatening', 'Crassus', 'Mukhamedov', 'turning', 'powerful', 'performance.Both', 'women', 'leads', 'Phrygia', 'wife', 'Spartacus', 'danced', 'Lyudmila', 'Semenyaka', 'Aegina', 'mistress', 'Crassus', 'danced', 'Maria', 'Bilova', 'are', 'well', 'danced', 'two', 'fine', 'music', 'one', 'major', 'attractions', 'ballet', 'music', 'very', 'well', 'performed', 'Bolshoi', 'orchestra', 'feature', 'corps', 'ballet', 'Spartacus', 'large', 'number', 'men', 'dancers', 'Bolshoi', 'can', 'provide', 'men', 'dancers', 'needed', 'icing', 'cake', 'here', 'men', 'women', 'dancers', 'do', 'outstanding', 'jobs.All', 'told', 'very', 'rewarding', 'ballet', 'experience', ""'re"", 'fan', 'ballet', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'music', 'Khachaturian', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'ballet', 'performance']",N/A
915205,A84TOOCIEF6FX,B0009X24R0,David Webb,"[0, 0]","Most ballets feature prima ballerinas, but Irek Mukhamedov (Spartacus) was clearly the star of this work. His dancing was phenomenal. It was an eruption of masculine power, elegance and presence. I would certainly follow him into the abyss. Aleksander Vetrov was menacing and virile as Crassus. Lyudmilla Semenyaka elegantly danced the role of the sensual Phrygia who was the consort of Spartacus. She made many difficult dance moves seem effortless and flowing. She and Spartacus were the most well proportioned pairing I have seen. Their interplay was marked by many lifts in which their bodies intertwined like vines. This was different from other ballets I have seen. Some of the lifts exhibited the spectacular strength of  Mukhamedov. Maria Bilova was sensational as Aegina who conspired with Crassus to help defeat Spartacus. This ballet has strikingly dramatic concluding scenes. Except for the famous love theme, the music was unknown to me. Khachaturian's score was pulsating and vibrant. It worked well with every aspect of this piece. The Bolshoi Orchestra produced a great sonic platform for the dancers. The sound quality was excellent. Most classical ballets concern fairy tales like the Sleeping Beauty or phantasms like Giselle. This work features classical dancing but the interplay of Spartacus and Phrygia departs from the traditional pas de deux, and has more of a modern dance feel.  Another potentially unique aspect of this ballet is the prominence of a separate male corps de ballet. This is not my favorite ballet but it should have wide appeal to lovers of classical dance. I will never see the Bolshoi in person so it is great to see them in performances like this. There are a few problems with this film as with all ballet films. However, the overall quality of sight and sound were excellent considering that this was a live performance",4,Spartacus Spartacus Spartacus!,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,1867,"['Most', 'ballets', 'feature', 'prima', 'ballerinas', 'Irek', 'Mukhamedov', 'Spartacus', 'was', 'clearly', 'star', 'work', 'dancing', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'was', 'eruption', 'masculine', 'power', 'elegance', 'presence', 'would', 'certainly', 'follow', 'abyss', 'Aleksander', 'Vetrov', 'was', 'menacing', 'virile', 'Crassus', 'Lyudmilla', 'Semenyaka', 'elegantly', 'danced', 'role', 'sensual', 'Phrygia', 'who', 'was', 'consort', 'Spartacus', 'made', 'many', 'difficult', 'dance', 'moves', 'seem', 'effortless', 'flowing', 'Spartacus', 'were', 'most', 'well', 'proportioned', 'pairing', 'have', 'seen', 'interplay', 'was', 'marked', 'many', 'lifts', 'bodies', 'intertwined', 'vines', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'ballets', 'have', 'seen', 'lifts', 'exhibited', 'spectacular', 'strength', 'Mukhamedov', 'Maria', 'Bilova', 'was', 'sensational', 'Aegina', 'who', 'conspired', 'Crassus', 'help', 'defeat', 'Spartacus', 'ballet', 'strikingly', 'dramatic', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'famous', 'love', 'theme', 'music', 'was', 'unknown', 'Khachaturian', 'score', 'was', 'pulsating', 'vibrant', 'worked', 'well', 'aspect', 'piece', 'Bolshoi', 'Orchestra', 'produced', 'great', 'sonic', 'platform', 'dancers', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'excellent', 'Most', 'classical', 'ballets', 'concern', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'phantasms', 'Giselle', 'work', 'classical', 'dancing', 'interplay', 'Spartacus', 'Phrygia', 'departs', 'traditional', 'pas', 'deux', 'more', 'modern', 'dance', 'feel', 'potentially', 'unique', 'aspect', 'ballet', 'prominence', 'separate', 'male', 'corps', 'ballet', 'not', 'favorite', 'ballet', 'should', 'have', 'wide', 'appeal', 'lovers', 'classical', 'dance', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'Bolshoi', 'person', 'great', 'see', 'performances', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'film', 'ballet', 'films', 'However', 'overall', 'quality', 'sight', 'sound', 'were', 'excellent', 'considering', 'was', 'live', 'performance']",N/A

This indicates how much I like it.  The performance is great, and the music thrilling.  I consider the overture to be one of the most exciting pieces of music I know (other than some parts of The Ring operas), and the following ""Might of Rome"" sequence keeps the feeling up.  In addition to the superb dancing, the acting is very moving.  Some time ago I bought another version by a different ballet company but although it was good, the Bolshoi version with Irek Mukhamedov and others is much better, I think (so I gave that one away).

The choreography and expressive dancing fully succeeded here.  The dancers' movements were both strikingly athletic and gracefully delicate and the costumes and scenery were extremely effective in setting the period atmosphere.  Aram Khachaturian's music was lush, beautiful and sometimes poignant, well performed by the theater orchestra.The Romans, led by Crassus, are obviously the bad guys.  Having the Roman soldiers march in a goose-step like the Nazis was extremely expressive.  Also, in some of the scenes the motions of the aristocratic Romans were more fluid and graceful than those of Spartacus' slave followers, who were more primitive and athletic.  This powerful visual symbolism was used to show the class differences between the antagonists.Phyrigia danced with heart-breaking grace, expressing feminine beauty at its loveliest.  Her love scenes with Spartacus were beautifully erotic.All technical aspects of this dvd were first rate.This production grabbed my attention from start to finish.
