But the DVD, for this to have came out in late 2011, there is no excuse not to remix the audio in 5.1....I'm not even sure this is a stereo mix! I heard no stereo separation in my speakers. What a shame! This DVD could have been the BEST DVD ever for Waylon. The Picture quality is 5 stars, very crisp and clear! The show was performed just  few hours before dawn and it looks great, you can see the landscape and all the fans out there, was a huge concert! This is still a MUST OWN DVD for any Waylon fan, just wish they took the audio and remixed in 5.1 but beggars cant be choosy I guess. The Best DVD out there for Waylon (in my opinion)is Waylon Live from Austin 1989.",4,"No 5.1 or even stereo mix, Video is fantastic",1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,744,"['Waylon', 'GREAT', 'steller', 'concert', '5', 'stars', 'easy', 'DVD', 'have', 'came', 'out', 'late', '2011', 'excuse', 'not', 'remix', 'audio', '5.1', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'stereo', 'mix', 'heard', 'stereo', 'separation', 'speakers', 'What', 'shame', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'BEST', 'DVD', 'ever', 'Waylon', 'Picture', 'quality', '5', 'stars', 'very', 'crisp', 'clear', 'show', 'was', 'performed', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'dawn', 'great', 'can', 'see', 'landscape', 'fans', 'there', 'was', 'huge', 'concert', 'still', 'MUST', 'OWN', 'DVD', 'Waylon', 'fan', 'just', 'wish', 'took', 'audio', 'remixed', '5.1', 'beggars', 'cant', 'be', 'choosy', 'guess', 'Best', 'DVD', 'there', 'Waylon', 'opinion', 'Waylon', 'Live', 'Austin', '1989']",N/A

1461076,A11CRJ5LQ5SYNY,B005HK13RM,"Linda ""Amazon Fan""","[3, 3]","The quality of this DVD is very good.  It shows Waylon in his outlaw prime.  I love Waylon Jennings so seeing him in mid-1983 and knowing that in June of 1984 he kicks his cocaine habit made seeing this video very special.  Even in the height of his addiction he was performing and doing an admirable job.  I loved the entire video and kept wishing the camera would pan around to whatever he was doing when Mooney's hands were being shown.  The band is great and so was he.  He and Jessi are so in love and she was such a marvelous influence..without her, I'm sure he would have continued drugging right up to the end.  As it is, they had 18 wonderful years after.  I liked him as the outlaw with the long hair and hat.  He was so special!  I read his autobiography and learned just how special he really was.  There'll never be another Waylon! If you like country mu8sic, you've got to get this DVD.",5,Waylon in His Prime--Simply Wonderful,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,900,"['quality', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'Waylon', 'outlaw', 'prime', 'love', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'seeing', 'mid-1983', 'knowing', 'June', '1984', 'cocaine', 'habit', 'made', 'seeing', 'video', 'very', 'special', 'Even', 'height', 'addiction', 'was', 'performing', 'doing', 'admirable', 'job', 'loved', 'entire', 'video', 'kept', 'wishing', 'camera', 'would', 'pan', 'whatever', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'Mooney', 'hands', 'were', 'being', 'shown', 'band', 'great', 'so', 'was', 'Jessi', 'are', 'so', 'love', 'was', 'such', 'marvelous', 'influence..without', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'drugging', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'had', '18', 'wonderful', 'years', 'liked', 'outlaw', 'long', 'hair', 'hat', 'was', 'so', 'special', 'read', 'autobiography', 'learned', 'just', 'how', 'special', 'really', 'was', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'Waylon', 'like', 'country', 'mu8sic', ""'ve"", 'got', 'get', 'DVD']",N/A
