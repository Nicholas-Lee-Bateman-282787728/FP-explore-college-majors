The vast majority of his films from ""Defiant Ones"" to ""Uptown Saturday Night"" have merit on some level. My personal favorite is ""Shoot to Kill"", but this is an excellent addition to any DVD library. What surprised me is I had not heard of it until I spotted it on Netflix and rented it. I was impressed with the story and acting by all. A sweet story of a small town and a man that could not touch anyone, but had a great impact on the town's feelings. Beautiful carpentry and excellent directing, sets, cars, costumes, and music add to the experience. Rich in what makes life interesting, this drama pits an elderly man against the all to well known new shopping center developer.

512238,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00001WY7P,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE SIMPLE LIFE OF NOAH DEARBORN (1999, Hallmark Pictures, 120 minutes) stars the immortal Sidney Poitier as Noah Dearborn, a 91-year-old marvel who farms his 35 acres and keeps to himself. When a greedy development eyeballs his land as part of the future shopping mall, things begin to get out of hand.What I found so compelling is the story of this man, who would have been born just after 1900. He is black and naturally I suppose one can imagine the hardships of his whole life. What strikes me about the way this character was written is Noah can't physically touch those about whom he cares most. This is of course a psychological reaction to his profound family losses--he is the only one of his family surviving.Poitier ranks highest among actors for all time. The way he uses his eyes in this film will surely move you to tears, the way Noah himself with his very silence seems to do so much good for other people. Not only was I touched deeply as a part-black man (my father was black and born in 1911), but I can readily identify with Noah's inability to touch others. Even my father had that problem, and Poitier's Noah reminded me of my father in so many ways.A young psychologist befriends Noah and even manages to save the day when things get ugly. I loved Poitier's work here--but then I will always watch anything with him in it.The Last Brickmaker in Americais another excellent example of Poitier's latter-day genius-level works. It reminds one of the stars of the past and how they are actually still with us, always. This is a very easy-going, compelling Hallmark Film that is unusual for that. It makes me wonder if this is originally a Hallmark movie production.I suggest you get this film because it is of far more importance to black history than you might think, and it is always a gift from heaven to see Sydney Poitier at work!",5,The Immortal Life of Sydney Poitier,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,1855,"['SIMPLE', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'NOAH', 'DEARBORN', '1999', 'Hallmark', 'Pictures', '120', 'minutes', 'immortal', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Noah', 'Dearborn', '91-year-old', 'marvel', 'who', '35', 'acres', 'When', 'greedy', 'development', 'land', 'part', 'future', 'shopping', 'mall', 'things', 'begin', 'get', 'hand.What', 'found', 'so', 'compelling', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'just', '1900', 'black', 'naturally', 'suppose', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'hardships', 'whole', 'life', 'What', 'way', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'Noah', 'ca', ""n't"", 'physically', 'touch', 'whom', 'most', 'course', 'psychological', 'reaction', 'profound', 'family', 'losses', 'only', 'one', 'family', 'surviving.Poitier', 'ranks', 'highest', 'actors', 'time', 'way', 'eyes', 'film', 'will', 'surely', 'move', 'tears', 'way', 'Noah', 'very', 'silence', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'other', 'people', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'touched', 'deeply', 'part-black', 'man', 'father', 'was', 'black', 'born', '1911', 'can', 'readily', 'identify', 'Noah', 'inability', 'touch', 'others', 'Even', 'father', 'had', 'problem', 'Poitier', 'Noah', 'reminded', 'father', 'so', 'many', 'ways.A', 'young', 'psychologist', 'befriends', 'Noah', 'even', 'manages', 'save', 'day', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'ugly', 'loved', 'Poitier', 'work', 'here', 'then', 'will', 'always', 'watch', 'anything', 'it.The', 'Last', 'Brickmaker', 'Americais', 'excellent', 'example', 'Poitier', 'latter-day', 'genius-level', 'works', 'one', 'stars', 'past', 'how', 'are', 'actually', 'still', 'always', 'very', 'easy-going', 'compelling', 'Hallmark', 'Film', 'unusual', 'wonder', 'originally', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'production.I', 'suggest', 'get', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'importance', 'black', 'history', 'might', 'think', 'always', 'gift', 'heaven', 'see', 'Sydney', 'Poitier', 'work']",The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn VHS
512239,ARU2H2PYTNCAX,B00001WY7P,e_j_buster,"[1, 8]","This is another one of those movies that pretends to be wholesome but is actually loaded with disgusting hidden messages.  There are so many things morally wrong with this movie that it would take several pages to adequately address everything.  So I'll just mention a few things here.This movie is about a 91 year old man who makes ALL of the ladies' hearts swoon.  Literally, every woman (young and old) in this film is totally smitten with this 91 year old man.  Whether or not this is realistic is beside the point.  The point is that this movie is pretending to say that,""with a passion for your work, it's possible to transcend age.""  But this movie is produced by the same people in Hollywood who are constantly telling us that being youthful is what it's all about.  If we listen to Hollywood, 35 is old.  So the premise of the movie is disingenuous because it is coming from the same source that tells us that 35 is old.But we can even find examples within the movie itself which prove that the supposed positive message (about transcending age) is disingenuous.  For example, in this movie, there are two particular women who are hot for Noah.  One is an attractive soft spoken fiftysomething  woman (only 40 years younger than Noah).  Noah treats her like crap.  The other woman is a mouthy thirtysomething tramp.  Guess which one Noah prefers..... The fact that Noah is hot for the thirtysomething tramp while being totally uninterested in the attractive fiftysomething woman shows that the fundamental message in this film is disingenuous.  The youthful woman wins Noah's affection, while the fiftysomething woman is treated like last week's ham sandwich.In the end, it is unclear whether or not Noah takes the young tramp to bed, but it is implied that he does.

You have this 90 year old man(Poitier) who is a carpenter. He enjoys what he does, he gives a helping hand to those who need it, and lives very simple. Then you get these people who want to put up a mall at the very location where Noah lives, and he doesn't want to sell. The uncanny thing about this guy is he is a workaholic, but he lives an unhurried life. He is 90, but he looks younger. He drives an ancient car from the 1930s that looks like it's in mint condition. He has some valuable property that these people want and they try to declare him incompetent and unfit to get it. How sad. Yet, the movie will not disappoint you.

512272,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00001WY7P,Tom Brody,"[2, 2]","THE SIMPLE LIFE OF NOAH DEARBORN concerns an elderly carpenter with deep roots in a small town, located in Anywhere, U.S.A.  In a nutshell, the carpenter (Sidney Poitier) has devoted his life to hand carpentry in the service of the townspeople for decades and decades, carving elegant doorframes, building chairs, carving wooden architectural cornices, and such.  All this he does using hand tools, which he learned to use from his now-deceased Uncle Silas.  Mr.Poitier is loved by the townsfolk for his skills in contributing to various woodworking projects, involving architectural accoutrements, park benches, and furniture.  After setting the tone for this, and other characters, the plot thickens.  A team of lawyers representing a shopping mall developer make plans to remove Mr.Poitier from his land.  First, they offer him about $300,000.  Then, they offer him about $600,000.  Then the lawyers manage to have Mr.Poitier committed to a mental hospital.  Then, they send a team of surveyors and bulldozers to the outskirts of Mr.Poitier's farm.  (Don't worry, I won't give away any more of the plot.)PERSECUTING NON-CONFORMISTS.  This movie develops the theme of non-conformism, a conventional theme in Hollywood, and the issue of persucution of a non-conformist.  Mr.Poitier is seen by the lawyers a non-conformist because of his unwillingness to develop any long-term relationship with other humans.  But the Mr.Poitier's reluctance to take off time from his carpentry in order to develop a long-term relationship is carefully explained, in the movie, as resulting from his self-devised technique for avoiding pain from loss of his Uncle Silas.  The theme of persecuting a non-conformist can be found in the Twilight Zone episode, THE MONSTERS ARE DUE ON MAPLE STREET.LOVE FOR ONE'S CRAFT.  A noble theme throughout this movie is Mr.Poitier's devotion to the craft of carpentry.  Any person out there in the audience possessing a technical skill, for example, in carpentry, engineering, chemistry, or computer science, will easily become emotionally emersed in this movie.  SPIRIT OF ST.LOUIS featuring Jimmy Stewart (as Lindbergh) is another movie where the theme is a man's love for one's craft (aviation).  AMADEUS featuring Tom Hulce (as Mozart) is yet another movie about a man's devotion to his craft (composition).REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS.  Another overriding theme in THE SIMPLE LIFE OF NOAH DEARBORN is the team of lawyers representing the shopping mall.  Threats from real estate developers is a recurring Hollywood theme, as most recently set forth in the PIXAR movie called, ""UP,"" and a decade or so ago, in POLTERGIEST, starring Zelda Rubinstein as the spiritual medium.  The theme of encroachment by real estate developers can also be found in the classic book for children, THE LITTLE HOUSE, by Virginia Lee Burton.  Real estate developers is a fact of life that is a source of frequent litigation, as is abundantly evident in books on property law, found in the campus book store of any law school.HOTTIE.  Actress Mary-Louise is a young hottie, who is the heroine of the film.  She is a physician, with training in psychiatry.  Her interesting way of speaking and her interesting facial expressions will keep all viewers, both male and female, glued to the television screen throughout this movie.  At first, she is the sweetie of one of the aggressive real estate lawyers.  But then, allegiances change somewhat.  FIVE STARS to this easy-to-understand movie.  It is suitable even for little kids.  There are no guns. There are no bad words.  And thank gawd, there are NO COMPUTER GRAPHICS.",5,A simplistic feel-good story that makes excellent use of traditional themes.,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,3614,"['SIMPLE', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'NOAH', 'DEARBORN', 'elderly', 'carpenter', 'deep', 'roots', 'small', 'town', 'located', 'Anywhere', 'U.S.A', 'nutshell', 'carpenter', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'devoted', 'life', 'hand', 'carpentry', 'service', 'townspeople', 'decades', 'decades', 'carving', 'elegant', 'doorframes', 'building', 'chairs', 'carving', 'wooden', 'architectural', 'cornices', 'such', 'using', 'hand', 'tools', 'learned', 'use', 'now-deceased', 'Uncle', 'Silas', 'Mr.Poitier', 'loved', 'townsfolk', 'skills', 'contributing', 'various', 'woodworking', 'projects', 'involving', 'architectural', 'accoutrements', 'park', 'benches', 'furniture', 'setting', 'tone', 'other', 'characters', 'plot', 'thickens', 'team', 'lawyers', 'representing', 'shopping', 'mall', 'developer', 'make', 'plans', 'remove', 'Mr.Poitier', 'land', 'First', 'offer', '300,000', 'Then', 'offer', '600,000', 'Then', 'lawyers', 'manage', 'have', 'Mr.Poitier', 'committed', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Then', 'send', 'team', 'surveyors', 'bulldozers', 'outskirts', 'Mr.Poitier', 'farm', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'plot', 'PERSECUTING', 'NON-CONFORMISTS', 'movie', 'theme', 'non-conformism', 'conventional', 'theme', 'Hollywood', 'issue', 'persucution', 'non-conformist', 'Mr.Poitier', 'seen', 'lawyers', 'non-conformist', 'unwillingness', 'develop', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'other', 'humans', 'Mr.Poitier', 'reluctance', 'take', 'off', 'time', 'carpentry', 'order', 'develop', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'carefully', 'explained', 'movie', 'resulting', 'self-devised', 'technique', 'avoiding', 'pain', 'loss', 'Uncle', 'Silas', 'theme', 'persecuting', 'non-conformist', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'MONSTERS', 'ARE', 'DUE', 'ON', 'MAPLE', 'STREET.LOVE', 'FOR', 'ONE', 'CRAFT', 'A', 'noble', 'theme', 'movie', 'Mr.Poitier', 'devotion', 'craft', 'carpentry', 'person', 'there', 'audience', 'possessing', 'technical', 'skill', 'example', 'carpentry', 'engineering', 'chemistry', 'computer', 'science', 'will', 'easily', 'become', 'emotionally', 'emersed', 'movie', 'SPIRIT', 'OF', 'ST.LOUIS', 'featuring', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Lindbergh', 'movie', 'where', 'theme', 'man', 'love', 'one', 'craft', 'aviation', 'AMADEUS', 'featuring', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Mozart', 'yet', 'movie', 'man', 'devotion', 'craft', 'composition', '.REAL', 'ESTATE', 'DEVELOPERS', 'overriding', 'theme', 'THE', 'SIMPLE', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'NOAH', 'DEARBORN', 'team', 'lawyers', 'representing', 'shopping', 'mall', 'Threats', 'real', 'estate', 'developers', 'recurring', 'Hollywood', 'theme', 'most', 'recently', 'set', 'forth', 'PIXAR', 'movie', 'called', 'UP', 'decade', 'so', 'ago', 'POLTERGIEST', 'starring', 'Zelda', 'Rubinstein', 'spiritual', 'medium', 'theme', 'encroachment', 'real', 'estate', 'developers', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'found', 'classic', 'book', 'children', 'THE', 'LITTLE', 'HOUSE', 'Virginia', 'Lee', 'Burton', 'Real', 'estate', 'developers', 'fact', 'life', 'source', 'frequent', 'litigation', 'abundantly', 'evident', 'books', 'property', 'law', 'found', 'campus', 'book', 'store', 'law', 'school.HOTTIE', 'Actress', 'Mary-Louise', 'young', 'hottie', 'who', 'heroine', 'film', 'physician', 'training', 'psychiatry', 'interesting', 'way', 'speaking', 'interesting', 'facial', 'expressions', 'will', 'keep', 'viewers', 'male', 'female', 'glued', 'television', 'screen', 'movie', 'first', 'sweetie', 'one', 'aggressive', 'real', 'estate', 'lawyers', 'then', 'allegiances', 'change', 'somewhat', 'FIVE', 'STARS', 'easy-to-understand', 'movie', 'suitable', 'even', 'little', 'kids', 'are', 'guns', 'are', 'bad', 'words', 'thank', 'gawd', 'are', 'NO', 'COMPUTER', 'GRAPHICS']",The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn VHS
