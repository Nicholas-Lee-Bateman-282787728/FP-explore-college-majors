Was the story based on a segment that actually happened during World War II?  No... at least I don't think it was.  I honestly don't know.  Maybe it was and the writers exaggerated it.I WAS having a bit of trouble understanding which army were the Germans and which ones were the British the entire time.  They both played a more important role compared to the American soldiers, who only appeared briefly.For every good, action packed gun-shooting scene, we had to put up with some questionable scenes that were either an indication that the writers didn't know how to make the action scenes look realistic, or didn't know how to make them flow properly.  Or maybe the writers were going for a parody of the entire film.  It was honestly confusing to me because I'm not sure what the writers intentions were.No, the Last Drop is not a quality war movie, but the amount of action, fairly decent acting by all the characters, interesting storytelling, and the plot development were good enough to give the film a passing grade.  Was it confusing understanding even HALF the things taking place in the film?  Oh yeah, definitely.

969873,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000E6ESTO,Grady Harp,"[4, 8]","THE LAST DROP could have been a better WW II film had the writer and director decided on the focus.  The directorial choices vary from very fine (mixing black and white grainy shots from war footage with stagy though competent settings in color) to questionable (allowing a musical score including steel guitar music and contemporary sounds to intrude into a time when such instrumentation was not even known) to mediocre (allowing the actors to be caricatures instead of players in a tense drama).Essentially the story is set before Christmas with the dropping of troops via gliders into Holland to secure a secret mission involving looted Nazi treasure.  The Germans are fast-driving to capture it and send it to Berlin before the Allies land.  The British team is determined to maintain custody of the goods until war's end.  And then of course there is a group of self-promoting Germans who simply want to capture the treasure for their own reward.  Not a bad set of conflicts, but the film's problems are centered on some bad casting choices that prevent the momentum from being as relentlessly forward as good war films should.  Some of the cast members look so much alike that it becomes difficult to determine just who is who: in one case this is intentional as the plot reveals in its ending, but in most cases it is a problem due to cramped dialects, stiff acting, and over the top parody.  With the exception of Billy Zane and Michael Madsen there are no big names here and in many ways that is a good thing because the two stars are the weakest characters.Though the plot outline has possibilities - what is war but greed under different names - the mixture of ribald humor and gut-wrenching realism fail to make the story work.

The film jumps from seriousness to parody; from classic war scenes to grotesque; from hilarious (or intended hilarious) situations to violent realistic sequences.In some aspects ""The Last Drop"" resembles ""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970), except that this last one was frankly in slapstick key (and was a good comedy BTW).The story is as follows. When Operation Market-Garden was launched trying to end WWII in a couple of months, Operation Matchbox was a secret mission inside the original one.The small commando party has secret goals known only to the Leader. The group lands (crashes) on Holland aboard of a glider and immediately are attacked by German forces.From this point on several groups of conflicting interests are introduced: an SS group with a secret mission, a group of rogue German soldiers in search of loot & revenge, a couple of infiltrated Dutch resistant, an accountant that is despised by all the other parties and last but  not least a caricature American Colonel with his corresponding armed  detachment.The plot grows more and more confusing with each scene... until at last film's end arrives and liberates the patient spectator.It is a pity some good resources are dilapidated as special effects and cinematography that are high-quality by themselves.Playacting if hard to evaluate as I think performers were as confused as viewer trying to identify which were the real traits of their characters.This is poor war film, that only hard-core WWII fan should give it a try.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",2,You Will Need Till The Last Drop of Your Patience to Watch This Film Until the End.,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,1574,"['Last', 'Drop', '2005', 'not', 'very', 'successful', 'hybrid', 'product', 'film', 'jumps', 'seriousness', 'parody', 'classic', 'war', 'scenes', 'grotesque', 'hilarious', 'intended', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'violent', 'realistic', 'sequences.In', 'aspects', 'Last', 'Drop', 'Kelly', 'Heroes', '1970', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'frankly', 'slapstick', 'key', 'was', 'good', 'comedy', 'BTW', '.The', 'story', 'When', 'Operation', 'Market-Garden', 'was', 'launched', 'trying', 'end', 'WWII', 'couple', 'months', 'Operation', 'Matchbox', 'was', 'secret', 'mission', 'original', 'one.The', 'small', 'commando', 'party', 'secret', 'goals', 'known', 'only', 'Leader', 'group', 'crashes', 'Holland', 'aboard', 'glider', 'immediately', 'are', 'attacked', 'German', 'forces.From', 'point', 'several', 'groups', 'conflicting', 'interests', 'are', 'introduced', 'SS', 'group', 'secret', 'mission', 'group', 'rogue', 'German', 'soldiers', 'search', 'loot', 'revenge', 'couple', 'infiltrated', 'Dutch', 'resistant', 'accountant', 'despised', 'other', 'parties', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'caricature', 'American', 'Colonel', 'corresponding', 'armed', 'detachment.The', 'plot', 'more', 'more', 'confusing', 'scene', 'last', 'film', 'end', 'patient', 'spectator.It', 'pity', 'good', 'resources', 'are', 'dilapidated', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'are', 'high-quality', 'themselves.Playacting', 'hard', 'evaluate', 'think', 'performers', 'were', 'as', 'confused', 'viewer', 'trying', 'identify', 'were', 'real', 'traits', 'characters.This', 'poor', 'war', 'film', 'only', 'hard-core', 'WWII', 'fan', 'should', 'give', 'try.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

During Operation Market Garden, another operation of British commandos, ""Matchbox"", is dropped behind enemy lines with hopes of obtaining a warehouse full of Nazi treasure, gold and famous paintings.  At the same time, a trio of rogue German soldiers is on their way to claim the treasure for their own.  This movie had potential, and I did enjoy it, but there are just too many storylines to keep up with.  Along with the British and German soldiers, there's an inept American general with his troops, resistance fighters, a revenge plot line, and several more.  However, the movie isn't all bad.  The action scenes are pretty well done, and when the story focuses on the two main plots, the British and Germans, it's an entertaining movie.Billy Zane plays Oates, the Canadian pilot of the glider carrying the British troops.  When the glider goes down, Oates tags along with them.  Zane is good, but his character has a Canadian accent that goes in and out.  Michael Madsen makes a brief appearance as General Colt, an American general who wants the treasure for himself.  His scenes, which are few and far between, are pretty painful to watch.  Karl Roden and Alexander Skarsgard play Beck and Voller, two of the rogue German soldiers seeking the gold.  The rest of the British commandos include Tommy Flanagan in a good part, Sean Pertwee, Rafe Spall, Neil Newbon, and Nick Moran.  The DVD has widescreen presentation, a Last Drop trailer, and trailers from three other movies.
