And I don't know exactly why, but I think it's because this was somewhat of a formulaic comedy similar to just about every other comedy out there.But the more I look back on the theater, I think I went into it looking for a &quot;classic&quot; comedy, something new and mind blowing, and this isn't that. This is along the lines of Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and even as far down the food chain as say Duece Bigalow or The Ladies Man.  (yes, I have targeted SNL Flicks there, but this movie DOES star Will Ferrell).  That being said, I think of this movie as having some great lines and or scenes (Shawnn William Scott's small part is one of my favorite parts of the entire movie).If you're looking for some goodhearted, crude, humor, then this is the flick, it's not a &quot;classic&quot; (it's not Animal House, as much as it wants to be), but it's well worth a watch or two.

611558,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JM1F,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The thing about movies like this is that they could very easily be forgettable and almost unforgivable in their ridiculousness.  I mean, how many movies about reckless middle aged men acting like twelve year olds can you stomach before you swear off the genre altogether?  Still, there is something almost endearing about Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn that make their shtick worth watching and completely enjoyable.  Sure, even they have had missteps and they can and do get old after a while, but overall their names draw me to them and their films and so that brings me to `Old School', one of their more successful ventures.The film is really dumb, when you look at it from a plot perspective.  I mean, you have Mitch, a straight laced man with a philandering wife who is best friends with two very immature men who are experiencing issues with their wives as well.  After catching his wife in the act (with two blind folded individuals), Mitch leaves home and rents a house near the campus of a nearby collage.  His two buddies are thrilled, for to them this means parties and college girls and drunken mistakes.  Mitch isn't really into all of that (why are they friends again?) but he's pulled into the debauchery and soon finds himself starting his own fraternity in an attempt to save his home (since the school wants to claim it for academic purposes).  His fraternity obviously seeks out the `losers' and becomes a joke until the very end when they prove themselves in ridiculous fashion and all is right in the world (including a happy ending for Mitch).Like I said, it's really dumb and yet it all works together thanks to some really funny jokes and the charisma that Ferrell and Vaughn bring to their scenes.  Ferrell is especially hilarious here, really nailing his take on, well, Will Ferrell (he does play himself or a variation of himself almost always).  The stupidity is balanced out by the humor, which is surprisingly well placed.  Even Wilson, who is a bore most of the time, comes out unscathed thanks to his charming persona and the chemistry he has with his co-stars.  Pompeo (the `other' Renee Zellweger) is beautiful as ever and adds a clich&eacute;d touch to the film (love interest with scuzzy boyfriend).It's not for everyone, and it's not for every mood, but if you like mindless humor with real bite, this one will work.",4,`Old School' brings new laughs...,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,2353,"['thing', 'movies', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'be', 'forgettable', 'almost', 'unforgivable', 'ridiculousness', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'reckless', 'middle', 'aged', 'men', 'acting', 'twelve', 'year', 'olds', 'can', 'stomach', 'swear', 'genre', 'altogether', 'Still', 'something', 'almost', 'endearing', 'about', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'make', 'shtick', 'worth', 'watching', 'completely', 'enjoyable', 'Sure', 'even', 'have', 'had', 'missteps', 'can', 'do', 'get', 'old', 'while', 'overall', 'names', 'draw', 'films', 'so', 'Old', 'School', 'one', 'more', 'successful', 'ventures.The', 'film', 'really', 'dumb', 'when', 'look', 'plot', 'perspective', 'mean', 'have', 'Mitch', 'straight', 'laced', 'man', 'philandering', 'wife', 'who', 'best', 'friends', 'two', 'very', 'immature', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'experiencing', 'issues', 'wives', 'as', 'well', 'catching', 'wife', 'act', 'two', 'blind', 'folded', 'individuals', 'Mitch', 'home', 'house', 'campus', 'nearby', 'collage', 'two', 'buddies', 'are', 'thrilled', 'parties', 'college', 'girls', 'drunken', 'mistakes', 'Mitch', ""n't"", 'really', 'why', 'are', 'friends', 'again', 'pulled', 'debauchery', 'soon', 'starting', 'own', 'fraternity', 'attempt', 'save', 'home', 'school', 'claim', 'academic', 'purposes', 'fraternity', 'obviously', 'out', 'losers', 'joke', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'prove', 'ridiculous', 'fashion', 'right', 'world', 'including', 'happy', 'ending', 'Mitch', '.Like', 'said', 'really', 'dumb', 'yet', 'together', 'thanks', 'really', 'funny', 'jokes', 'charisma', 'Ferrell', 'Vaughn', 'bring', 'scenes', 'Ferrell', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'here', 'really', 'nailing', 'take', 'well', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'play', 'variation', 'almost', 'always', 'stupidity', 'balanced', 'out', 'humor', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'placed', 'Even', 'Wilson', 'who', 'bore', 'most', 'time', 'out', 'unscathed', 'thanks', 'charming', 'persona', 'chemistry', 'co-stars', 'Pompeo', 'other', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'touch', 'film', 'love', 'interest', 'scuzzy', 'boyfriend', '.It', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'mood', 'like', 'mindless', 'humor', 'real', 'bite', 'one', 'will', 'work']",Old School

The film was a hysterical look at a group of fraternity buddies at college out looking for a good time. The film made a legend out of then ""Saturday Night Live"" castmember John Belushi and became a comedy classic.25 years after the release of ""Animal House"" came ""Old School"". Well, ladies and gentleman, you finally have the 21st century version of ""Animal House"". I mean seriously, consider the facts: both films have to do with old college buddies out to for a good time, and both feature showstopping performances by ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members (Will Ferrell is so funny in this film).Mitch Mitchell (Luke Wilson) is a successful bsinessman with a beautiful home and an equally beautiful girlfriend (Juliette Lewis). But things soon come crashing down when he realizes that his girlfriend is cheating on him. Distraught, he moves out and seeks sollace from his friends Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and the newly married, ex - party boy Frank ""The Tank"" Ricard (Will Ferrell, playing the Bluto of this film). Their plan: to turn Mitch's new home into a college fraternity, where kids can enjoy loud music, alcohol and hot women galore. The plan becomes a huge success - until dean Prichard (Jeremy Piven, who is hysterical) intervenes, saying that Mitch's house is college property and he must move out. What ensues is an all out war to keep their beloved frat and the good times rolling.""Old School"" is chock full of hilarious and unforgetttable moments, including the opening scene where Mitch realizes his girlfriend is cheating on him, a KY jelly show that goes horribly wrong, and Frank getting shot in the neck with a dart. But none are more funnier when Will Ferrell takes of his clothes and begins streaking. The best part is when his wife catches him, forces him to get in the car and go home, when Will all of a sudden spits out, ""Do you think KFC is still open?""In addition to its strong main cast, it also features some great supporting roles and cameos by Elisha Cuthbert (Jack Bauer's daughter on the first three seasons of ""24""), Snoop Dogg, Seann William Scott (Stifler from ""American Pie""), and most hilariously, Andy Dick (I can't really go into detail about the latter's part).I haven't watched all the extras, but I can tell you that the ""Inside The Actors Studio"" spoof is definitely worth the price of this dvd. ""Old School"" is a great film for everyone who enjoys fine Americsn comedy (and especially ""Animal House"" fans).",5,"""Animal House"" For The 20th Century",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,2519,"['1978', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'called', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Animal', 'House', 'film', 'was', 'hysterical', 'look', 'group', 'fraternity', 'buddies', 'college', 'out', 'looking', 'good', 'time', 'film', 'made', 'legend', 'then', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'castmember', 'John', 'Belushi', 'became', 'comedy', 'classic.25', 'years', 'release', 'Animal', 'House', 'came', 'Old', 'School', 'Well', 'ladies', 'gentleman', 'finally', 'have', '21st', 'century', 'version', 'Animal', 'House', 'mean', 'seriously', 'consider', 'facts', 'films', 'have', 'do', 'old', 'college', 'out', 'good', 'time', 'feature', 'showstopping', 'performances', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'cast', 'members', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'so', 'funny', 'film', '.Mitch', 'Mitchell', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'successful', 'bsinessman', 'beautiful', 'home', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'things', 'soon', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'cheating', 'Distraught', 'out', 'seeks', 'sollace', 'friends', 'Beanie', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'newly', 'married', 'ex', 'party', 'boy', 'Frank', 'Tank', 'Ricard', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'playing', 'Bluto', 'film', 'plan', 'turn', 'Mitch', 'new', 'home', 'college', 'fraternity', 'where', 'kids', 'can', 'enjoy', 'loud', 'music', 'alcohol', 'hot', 'women', 'galore', 'plan', 'huge', 'success', 'dean', 'Prichard', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'who', 'hysterical', 'intervenes', 'saying', 'Mitch', 'house', 'college', 'property', 'must', 'move', 'out', 'What', 'out', 'war', 'keep', 'beloved', 'frat', 'good', 'times', 'rolling', 'Old', 'School', 'chock', 'full', 'hilarious', 'unforgetttable', 'moments', 'including', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Mitch', 'girlfriend', 'cheating', 'KY', 'jelly', 'show', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Frank', 'getting', 'shot', 'neck', 'dart', 'none', 'are', 'more', 'funnier', 'when', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'clothes', 'streaking', 'best', 'part', 'when', 'wife', 'get', 'car', 'go', 'home', 'when', 'Will', 'sudden', 'spits', 'out', 'Do', 'think', 'KFC', 'still', 'open', 'addition', 'strong', 'main', 'cast', 'also', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles', 'cameos', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'daughter', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', '24', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'Stifler', 'American', 'Pie', 'most', 'hilariously', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'detail', 'latter', 'part', '.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'extras', 'can', 'tell', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'spoof', 'definitely', 'worth', 'price', 'dvd', 'Old', 'School', 'great', 'film', 'everyone', 'who', 'fine', 'Americsn', 'comedy', 'especially', 'Animal', 'House', 'fans']",Old School

In the spirit of Animal House and PCU, Old School brings together a strange amalgam of immature males who wreck havoc on their college campus through wild parties, outrageous pranks, and outright criminal activities. Starring Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Farrell (of Saturday Night Live fame), Old School reads like a great SNL skit. You'll laugh yourself silly over this one.When Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) returns home early from a business seminar at his extraordinarily boring job, he finds his girlfriend cheating on him. They break up, and he's forced to move out. Moving into an off-campus dwelling at his old school, Mitch's friends Frank Ricard (Will Farrell) and Bernard ""Beanie"" Campbell (Vince Vaughn) reminisce about the glory of their fraternity days. The days of all fun and no work... Frank gets married, despite Beanie's attempts to talk him out of it at the altar (during the ceremony), but he quickly grows despondent and longs to enjoy the freedom of his youth once again. Meanwhile, Beanie is a bona fide family man with a successful business, but he too would like to relive the fun of their fraternity days.Together, the three men decide to turn Mitch's house into a fraternity. They recruit a series of misfit students from around campus - nerds, social rejects, homeless men, and ninety-year-old womanizers. The hazing rituals are beyond description, and the parties are ridiculously outlandish and hilarious. All is going well (for everyone but Frank whose wife catches him running down main street naked) until Dean of Student Affairs Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), a former estranged classmate of the three men, decides to crack down on the fraternity. When he does, the fraternity must pass a series of tests and obstacles in order to retain their charter (and this, the climatic high-point of the film, is also the funniest of all).Fun from beginning to end, Old School will not win any awards for dramatic scenes or cinematography. But it will win a lot of points as an outright hilarious comedy. If you haven't seen this film, then you really don't know what you're missing. Old School is a classic cult comedy fulfilling the dreams of countless former college fraternity members who ache to relive the greatest party days of their lives. Because it's so funny, Old School is a definite must-see film.

Pulling from movies like Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, or any movie about college boozefests, this movie gives a hour and some change of nothing but zanyness. Let me say that I love Will Ferrell and he steals the show on every movie he plays in (i.e.- Austin Powers, Ladies Man, etc). Will plays a recovering alcoholic by the name of Frank ""The Tank"". He decides that Frank ""The Tank"" needs to be put behind him, so he changes his life and gets married. However, he has a friend name Beanie (Vince Vaughn) that has other ideas. Beanie is a married man who hates marriage......figure that one out. Beanie is hell bent on going back to the days of his youth and he needed a way to do it. Thus, enters Mitch (Luke Wilson) who after finding out his girlfriend is a freak moved to a house that was near the college campus. Frank and Beanie decide to cheer him up by throwing this wild, binge drinking party (Mitchapalooza). That's when the madness begins. Frank The Tank relapsed back to his old ways and soon becomes the life of the party when he joins in on the binge drinking. Add some willing co-eds, banging music, more drunk college students, and Snoop Dogg (better known as Snoop-a-Loop) and you have yourself a legendary party. The three men become instant legends on campus and decide to form a Fraternity that is like none other. They do it to spite the dean who hates their guts because they picked on him when they were teens. That's where it really gets crazy. Mitch becomes known as the Godfather. Frank begins to have marital problems. From streaking to K-Y Jelly wrestling to tranquilizer darts, this movie delivers nothing but good times. Will Ferrell is one of my favorite comedians. His physical comedy is probably one of the best in the business. He doesn't take it as far as Jim Carrey does, which is a good thing. He gives you just enough to keep you in stitches. Vince Vaughn plays the part of a sleazy salesman to the max. Once again, I will say that comedies are supposed to be more funny than real. If you want real life, watch real life stories or a drama based on a true story. Comedies are founded on the premises of making people laugh and this comedy is no exception. If you want to laugh, rent this movie. It's hilarious. If you enjoyed Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, and any other college boozefest, then you will love this movie. The ending is a bit cliche and the plot is a bit too farcical, but what it is is good slapstick comedy. Oh yeah, there is even a love story thrown into the madness. I give it an A.

I am also a huge Vince Vaughn fan, so when you get them together with a script allowing them to take over and expose their comedic genius then I am all for it.  Sure, Luke Wilson is the star but put him on the screen with either of the aformentioned and he fades into the backdrop.  The film revolves around three friends, each of which are having women troubles.  You have Frank (Ferrell) who has just got hitched but his marriage is already having trouble.  Then theres Mitch (Wilson) who just caught his girlfriend (Julitte Lewis) having some S&M fun with a few people in their house.  And finally we have Beanie (Vaughn) who is successful and married to a beautiful woman (Leah Remini) and has two children but is missing the fun he once had with booze and young women.  So, in an effort to bring themselves up from the slump they are in they decide to throw a large party at Mitch's new house near the local college campus.  The party is a success and they are the new kings of the town.  (The whole 'Frank the Tank' scene is the greatest scene in the film)  There's one problem, and his name is 'Dean' Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Pivon in a hilarious role).  Gordon has history with the three party animals and is determined to have them evicted.  So, in an effort to save their home they start a fraturnity which turns into the base for one hilarious film.  Cameos from the likes of Snoop Dogg and Sean Williams Scott as well as the always funny Andy Dick give this film even more cred.  Throw in the spark of a new love for Mitch with the beautiful Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) and her jealous and perverted boyfriend Mark (Craig Kilborn) and throw in Elisha Cuthburt for good messure and you have a non-stop laugh fest that will never get old.",5,"""I saw Blue, and he was glorious!""",1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,1773,"['am', 'HUGE', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'fan', 'am', 'also', 'huge', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'fan', 'so', 'when', 'get', 'together', 'script', 'allowing', 'take', 'over', 'expose', 'comedic', 'genius', 'then', 'am', 'Sure', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'star', 'put', 'screen', 'aformentioned', 'backdrop', 'film', 'three', 'friends', 'are', 'having', 'women', 'troubles', 'have', 'Frank', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'hitched', 'marriage', 'already', 'having', 'trouble', 'Then', 'Mitch', 'Wilson', 'who', 'just', 'caught', 'girlfriend', 'Julitte', 'Lewis', 'having', 'S', 'M', 'fun', 'few', 'people', 'house', 'finally', 'have', 'Beanie', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'successful', 'married', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Leah', 'Remini', 'two', 'children', 'missing', 'fun', 'once', 'had', 'booze', 'young', 'women', 'So', 'effort', 'bring', 'up', 'slump', 'are', 'decide', 'throw', 'large', 'party', 'Mitch', 'new', 'house', 'local', 'college', 'campus', 'party', 'success', 'are', 'new', 'kings', 'town', 'whole', ""'Frank"", 'Tank', 'scene', 'greatest', 'scene', 'film', 'one', 'problem', 'name', ""'Dean"", 'Gordon', 'Pritchard', 'Jeremy', 'Pivon', 'hilarious', 'role', 'Gordon', 'history', 'three', 'party', 'animals', 'determined', 'have', 'evicted', 'So', 'effort', 'save', 'home', 'start', 'fraturnity', 'base', 'one', 'hilarious', 'film', 'Cameos', 'likes', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Sean', 'Williams', 'Scott', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'funny', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'give', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'cred', 'Throw', 'spark', 'new', 'love', 'Mitch', 'beautiful', 'Nicole', 'Ellen', 'Pompeo', 'jealous', 'perverted', 'boyfriend', 'Mark', 'Craig', 'Kilborn', 'throw', 'Elisha', 'Cuthburt', 'good', 'messure', 'have', 'non-stop', 'laugh', 'fest', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'old']",Old School

He takes every scene that he appears in, hands down.  The idea for this film is quite original. I agree with the reviewer who remarked that the comedy in this film is quite fresh until it becomes a classic ""beat-all-odds"" competition at the end.  There is never a dull moment.  As with any modern comedy, there are many inconsistencies and storylines that are not completed or followed out: Wilson sleeps with an underage girl without consequence &amp; Ferrell's divorce that passes without a problem or second mention.  But following these storylines would have detracted from the central pivot of the film: the second coming of the fraternity.  Before watching this film, I thought much of the comedy would focus upon this fraternity.  But the comedy that exists in the tangential storylines is enough to carry the entire film.""Old School"" is an exciting and fresh comedy.

In the pantheon of movies that qualify for this genre, it rates above 'PCU' and is close to 'Animal House.'  Although many of the traditional ""fraternity movie"" elements are present in this movie, it does have some of its own twists.The movie focuses on three men that are currently out of school and have fallen into a rut.  Luke Wilson plays Mitch ""The Godfather"" Martin.  Mitch returns home from a real estate conference to discover his live in girlfriend has been living an alternative lifestyle (to put it mildly).  Unable to cope with this, Mitch moves out of the house and into a property close to the local college campus.  Mitch's buddies, Frank Richard (played by Will Ferrell) and Beanie (played by Vince Vaughn), quickly start working on a plot to get Mitch's social life back into gear....The usual ""fraternity movie"" pranks and plot lines show up.  Mitch, Beanie, and Frank launch a fraternity which only has some college students, but they run into trouble with the Dean, played by Jeremy Piven, who seems to have it in for the fraternity for no apparent reason other than he is the Dean and thats what Deans do.  There are some scenes that contain hazing, pranks, and party antics that are legendary (if not urban legends).Contrary to what you might think, Will Ferrell is not the main character of this movie.  He does play a significant role, but the movie really focuses on Luke Wilson's character.  That being said, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn steal the show throughout the movie as their character's antics are a great juxtaposition to Luke Wilson's straight man.DVD enthusiasts will be pleased by all the extras.  There is the standard 'making of' documentary.  There is a spoof of ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" in which Will Ferrell plays James Lipton as he interviews the cast and director of the movie.  Personally, I felt this feature was a bit flat and slow.  There is a pretty good outtake reel as well amongst other features.Overall, I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for a mindless good time.  This movie is by no means a thinker.  While it might be suitable for teens, its not for children.  It did deserve its R rating.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[15, 18]","I know, I know, the plot for this film has been rehashed from &quot;Animal House&quot; and countless other college debauchery flicks, but so what?  OLD SCHOOL is a hilarious romp of scintillating and titillating proportions, a 90-minute mad dash of sight gags, crude one-liners, and tongue-in-cheek zaniness.  If college fraternities were really like this I never would have left academia (well, I did have my own &quot;eight-year-plan,&quot; but that's another story).Three thirtysomething buddies (Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell) decide to revitalize their lives by cranking up a college fraternity whose members are not required to be students at the local university.  Of course, such a blasphemous act draws the ire of the college's administrators (insert &quot;Animal House&quot; plot here), and accordingly, the fledgling frat must do battle with the corrupt, unscrupulous establishment.  Sure, this ground's been covered before in countless other movies, but OLD SCHOOL adds its own loony spin of mayhem--from concrete blocks tied to fragile appendages, to eye-opening mud wrestling.While OLD SCHOOL's cast, from top to bottom, is excellent, Will Ferrell dominates this film (much like Dangerfield in &quot;Caddyshack,&quot; or Belushi in &quot;Animal House&quot;).  As Frank &quot;the Tank&quot; Ricard, a newlywed with a party animal mentality, Ferrell's over-the-top antics are bust-a-gut, roll-on-the-floor funny.  Ferrell, whether he's streaking or performing a gymnastics floor exercise, carries this film like a fullback with a football.If in fact we equate entertainment with escapism (which I do), OLD SCHOOL delightfully fits the bill.  You'll forget the problems of the day with this puppy, and you'll have fun in the process.--D.

One of several movies that have been engendered by the truly classic ""Animal House,"" ""Old School"" is about on par with ""Road Trip"" when it comes to plausibility, humor, and grossness.Like ""Animal House,"" ""Old School"" involves men living together in a fraternity. Unlike ""Animal House,"" the fellows in the fraternity aren't in their late teens and early twenties, but are mostly married men, several years beyond college age, whose marriages are on the rocks, and who have decided to move into a house near a college campus and form a fraternity of sorts (one where enrollment in the college is not necessary).There is little in this movie that is the least bit profound, and the storyline is rather thin. However, there are a number of really funny scenes, and Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell in particular do their usual outstanding job of making their characters come alive. Although there are a few scenes that amply warrant the ""R"" rating the movie received, for the most part the movie consists of funny, though sometimes sophomoric hijinks.

Through parties, and subversive behavior the frat finds it's way to stay on campus and more importantly make us the audience laugh. The frat brothers are as diverse as it gets, from an enormously overweight kid to an incredibly old sailor named Blue. I wasn't really a huge Will Ferrel fan going into this film, but after seeing this hilarious film with some seriouss spray milk through the nose moments I came out ranking his performance up their with the likes of Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, and Dan Akroyd. His scene in the pool will go down in history as one of the all time great comedy classics. The only weak parts in this film to me were some of the romantic sub-plots between Luke Wilson and his old high school sweet heart.

They saw I was renting the DVD and told me it was a crappy movie.  I didn't believe them.  I thought that because they were young, maybe they just didn't get it.  Maybe they couldn't relate to some middle aged men trying to recapture some of their youth. Or maybe the jokes were just too mature or referenced too much of the seventies. But, they were right.  It has nothing to do with character study at all.  It is just a bunch of dumb, juvenile jokes that even teenagers don't think is funny.This movie starts off promising, and there are some funny moments in the first half.

611641,A2NUHWMHA9XNKV,B00005JM1F,Lady Raven RAVE!,"[2, 5]","Old School, One of the Most Hilarious Comedies You'll Ever WitnessIf you have not seen the comedy ""Old School"" then you are missing a great laugh. With Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson as the stars of the movie, you will not be disappointed with this two-hour long stretch of pure fun. This movie, while some parts are quite fictional, relates well to college students, especially those in a fraternity or sorority. Will Ferrell (Frank) and Vince Vaughn (Beanie) long to relive their college years at their friend's expense. Luke Wilson (Mitch) buys a house on a college campus, because he wants to get away from his broken relationship with his wife. Mitch comes home at the beginning of the movie to find her sleeping with another man. Frank and Beanie create the brilliant idea that they will start a college fraternity on this campus, but they run into a terrible problem because the dean remembers how ruthless these men were to him in college, and he is trying to get rid the campus of them. As three older men, who once lived the college life, try to start a fraternity, they meet many challenges with the college's administration. The challenges that these men endure are what make the movie so funny. In one scene of the movie, Frank loses his wife because of the time he spends at the fraternity house. ""Old School"" is a great movie based purely on the non-stop laughter you will have. Between the challenges of the commencement of the fraternity and the everyday lives of Frank, Mitch, and Beanie ""Old School"" gives every audience a sense of humor about their own lives. Not only is the movie hysterical in and of itself, it illustrates to everyone that life should not be taken so seriously. In the end, Mitch gets the girl that truly loves him, and Frank is finally happy once he becomes the president of the fraternity. Beanie goes back to his normal life of selling audio equipment, but he still lingers around the fraternity that he helped build. The final moral to the movie is how the founders of the fraternity take care of the students they pledged into the fraternity. Yes, the pledgeship that these students endure is quite comical, but when they are faced with being expelled from school, the three founders and all the students in the fraternity are what push them through the tough times. This is a movie that you must see if you enjoyed your college years and if you just need a good laugh.",5,"another corky, silly &funny movie i love",1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,2427,"['Old', 'School', 'One', 'Most', 'Hilarious', 'Comedies', ""'ll"", 'Ever', 'WitnessIf', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'comedy', 'Old', 'School', 'then', 'are', 'missing', 'great', 'laugh', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'stars', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'two-hour', 'long', 'stretch', 'pure', 'fun', 'movie', 'parts', 'are', 'quite', 'fictional', 'well', 'college', 'students', 'especially', 'fraternity', 'sorority', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Frank', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Beanie', 'long', 'relive', 'college', 'years', 'friend', 'expense', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Mitch', 'house', 'college', 'campus', 'get', 'away', 'broken', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Mitch', 'home', 'beginning', 'movie', 'find', 'sleeping', 'man', 'Frank', 'Beanie', 'create', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'will', 'start', 'college', 'fraternity', 'campus', 'run', 'terrible', 'problem', 'dean', 'how', 'ruthless', 'men', 'were', 'college', 'trying', 'get', 'rid', 'campus', 'three', 'older', 'men', 'who', 'once', 'lived', 'college', 'life', 'try', 'start', 'fraternity', 'meet', 'many', 'challenges', 'college', 'administration', 'challenges', 'men', 'endure', 'are', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'funny', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'Frank', 'wife', 'time', 'fraternity', 'house', 'Old', 'School', 'great', 'movie', 'based', 'purely', 'non-stop', 'laughter', 'will', 'have', 'Between', 'challenges', 'commencement', 'fraternity', 'everyday', 'lives', 'Frank', 'Mitch', 'Beanie', 'Old', 'School', 'audience', 'sense', 'humor', 'own', 'lives', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'hysterical', 'everyone', 'life', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'so', 'seriously', 'end', 'Mitch', 'girl', 'truly', 'Frank', 'finally', 'happy', 'once', 'president', 'fraternity', 'Beanie', 'back', 'normal', 'life', 'selling', 'audio', 'equipment', 'still', 'fraternity', 'helped', 'build', 'final', 'moral', 'movie', 'how', 'founders', 'fraternity', 'take', 'care', 'students', 'pledged', 'fraternity', 'Yes', 'pledgeship', 'students', 'endure', 'quite', 'comical', 'when', 'are', 'faced', 'being', 'expelled', 'school', 'three', 'founders', 'students', 'fraternity', 'are', 'what', 'push', 'tough', 'times', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'enjoyed', 'college', 'years', 'just', 'need', 'good', 'laugh']",Old School
611642,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JM1F,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","First of all, a banana is not a vegetable.  A vegetable is a usually herbaceous plant (such as the cabbage, bean, or potato), which is grown for an edible part that can be eaten as part of a meal.  In contrast, a banana is an elongated usually tapering tropical fruit with soft pulpy flesh enclosed in a soft and usually yellow rind.Second of all, the myth of Romulus and Remus is a Roman legend and not a Greek story.  Seduced by the god Mars (not Ares), the Vestal Virgin Rhea Silvia bore twin sons, Romulus and Remus.  Left to die in a basket on the river Tiber by her wicked uncle Amulius, the babes washed up on shore and were nursed by a she-wolf and fed bits of food by a bird until they were found and raised by a shepherd.  Growing to manhood they discovered their true identities and eventually founded the city of Rome, over the dead body of Remus.When a film like &quot;Old School,&quot; which takes place across the street from a college campus, gets the facts wrong it certainly takes away from your enjoyment of the comedy.  Maybe when Will Ferrell's Frank is streaking down the street he is doing that wrong as well.  Maybe Vince Vaughn's Beanie does not give you the keys to Speaker City if he cannot beat a competitor's deal.  Maybe Luke Wilson's Mitch does remember what happened when he woke up in bed with an under aged coed.&quot;Old School&quot; is about the aforementioned trio of friends who are disenchanted with becoming adults in the real world and who end up turning the house Mitch is renting into a college fraternity so that he can stay there.  That particular situation is contrived, to say the least, but then it ends up being pretty clear that the point of this film is to put three thirtysomething guys in situations that borrow from &quot;Animal House&quot; and pretty much every other party animal college film you have seen.Ironically, given that this is the &quot;unrated edition,&quot; which means they throw everything back into the movie except a handful of deleted scenes, the storyline of &quot;Old School&quot; ends up seeming like scenes have been cut.  The relationship between Mitch and Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) hits a couple of stereotypical snags and they end up getting resolved off screen.  However, the biggest offense of this film is that when it comes time for the frat boys to take on the evil, wicked, bad, mean, and nasty Dean Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), the film fails to come up with anything that is either particulary memorable or especially funny.  Instead of having a climax, this film just sort of peters out at the end.Yes, there are some big laughs, such as when we learn a new use for asphalt bricks, but the film is mostly Vaughn and Ferrell stealing scenes from Wilson, who really does not have a whole lot to do here.  The extras include the previously mentioned deleted scenes, some outtakes and bloopers, and a less than steller parody of &quot;Inside the Actor's Studio&quot; (Ferrell does double-duty but the other two stars and writer-director Todd Phillips (&quot;Frat House,&quot; &quot;Road Trip&quot;) look lost during the proceedings.

Also, it's just another excuse to watch Will Ferrell (one of the funniest guys alive in my opinion) doing what he does best: make us laugh until we fall from our seats. Also, this Unrated version is the one you want to have, where they make sure not to hold back any punches. And did I mention that, for a change, the special features [aren't bad]?The plot is the least important thing. Actually, it's very formulaic: Luke Wilson's character buys a house on campus territory and lets his crazy friends (played by Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell) to make a giant monster of a party. It's so wild, that the next day he is kicked off the University grounds by the Dean (played by Jeremy Piven, who does the complete opposite of his character in ""PCU""). So the three friends have only one solution: start a fraternity. From then on, you know the drill. They have to overcome all obstacles and beat the system that's trying to bring them down.The movie is also a wonderful parody of ""Fight Club"", not only because of key scenes involving the recruiting of new frat members, but also because it carries the same load of self-destruction, especially regarding the character of Will Ferrell: Frank the Tank, a guy who realizes he doesn't want to live the life of a married man and returns to the life he used to have in college, mainly becoming a sloppy drunk. You can see also lots of cameo appearances, like 24's Elisha Cuthbert, Juliette Lewis, Sean William Scott and Snoop Dog. The humor in this film is very 80's, but it doesn't come close to the stupidity of teen films like ""American Pie"", ""Not Another Teen movie"" or ""Just Married"". This one is made by proffesionals, and you can see that.Now, for the edition, I think the best thing is the Inside the Actors Studio spoof. I would buy the DVD for this feature alone! You know from SNL that Will Ferrell does a great impersonation of James Lipton, and here he does a 20-minute piece in which Lipton interviews him and the rest of the cast. The fact that no one is laughing and the interview has a ""serious"" tone makes it even funnier! Just watch it and you'll pass out laughing. I know I did. The other features are ok, but this is the one to check out.So, in conclusion, ""Old School"" may not be the best comedy around, but it makes a sincere effort in avoiding the cliches of today's comedies and return to hard-core stuff with great, experienced comedians. For all fans of will Ferrell is a must see, but if you want the best college comedies, you're better off getting ""Animal House"".

I wasn't let down at all.Mitch Martin(Wilson) is in his early thirties and works in the real estate business. He goes home one night to find his girlfriend with some other people and the relationship is off. In his depression he goes and buys a house up near the local Harrison University.Frank(Ferrel) is getting married. He is a little unsure of marrigae but does it anyways. He however can't pass up the chance to party with Mitch at his new place.Beanie(Vaughn) is a millionaire. He owns six electornic stores and he looks at Mitch's new place as a huge opportunity. The place is right by the school that means one stop long party every night and everyday.The first party is a blast and Mitch becomes a hero to these local university students. However, there fun is stopped short by Dean Pritchard(Piven) who says they can't live in student housing. They have until the end of the week to leave. The guys don't like that idea and they decide to start a fraternity.They get there pledges and the fraternity is on. Pritchard won't stop though and he will do anything to shut them down. Now the guys  must keep the party rolling and stop Pritchard before he stops them.This movie is hilarious. There isn't anything not to like about it. The three major stars make the movie. Will Ferrel is one of the funniest guys alive. Old School is his funniest movie to date. Vince Vaughn is the man. He's his normal funny self and Luke Wilson is great. It's the funniest movie of his carear. You have to love these three guys in the movie.I love Old School. This reminded me a lot of Animal House and a lot have labeled it as this generations Animal House and I agree. This is a great frat humor movie and if you love that kind of stuff you will love Old School. If you prefer a cleaner comedy than this is not your ideal movie.Check Old School out.

While it's in no way an outstanding movie, it gets the job done in the Funny Department.  I'm not really picky when it comes to comedies.  As long as I laugh, I'm pretty happy.  This movie made me laugh numerous times, no matter how goofy or lame the gag.Mitch thought he had the perfect life, until he came home early one day and found out some of his girlfriend's &quot;erotic&quot; pastimes.  Needless to say, the two break up and go their separate ways.  Now, Mitch has to move out and start a new life, while still being broken up about the whole ordeal.  His friends, Beanie and Frank, are determined to get their friend to be happy again---so they decide the best course of action is starting their own fraternity!  The guys may be in their thirties, but they still know how to have a good time and live it up as if they were still in college.  However, the dean is none too happy with the new &quot;frat house&quot; and is determined to get it shut down, no matter what it takes.  All of this leads up to a very hilarious movie.Directed by Todd Philips (&quot;Road Trip&quot;), &quot;Old School&quot; is highly entertaining and comical.  It's raunchy, of course, but it still knows how to be funny without going over-the-top in every scene or gag.  While it's in no way a masterpiece, I was very entertained for the entire 1 hour and 32 minutes.  Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn are very funny in their roles and really make the script work.  The person who really steals the show, however, is none other than Will Ferrell as &quot;Frank 'The Tank.'&quot;  I don't know if the movie would have been half as good without him.  He really knows how to take his comical antics to the limit and is never afraid to try anything new (even if it means &quot;streaking&quot; in a neighborhood, only to be caught by his new wife moments later).  All in all, the movie has many elements of hilarity that works most of the time.The DVD has some neat features to offer.  One of the main highlights is that this is &quot;uncensored&quot; and shows footage that could have never been shown in the theatres.  I've never seen the theatrical version, so I have no idea what was added.  I do know that it is an extremely outrageous movie and can tell why exactly it is &quot;uncensored.&quot;  Surprisingly, this movie is offered in DTS.  I don't really see this as a movie needing it, but hey, I'm not about to complain about it.  Extras included are bloopers and outtakes, deleted scenes, featurettes, commentary, and more.  Plenty of cool features to play around with.I ended up really enjoying &quot;Old School&quot; for what it was.  There will be many people who will not enjoy the raunchiness of the movie, but there will be many others who will.  If you're looking for just a plain ol' good time, then this might be the movie to check out.  The movie did its job and made me laugh.  That's usually all that I look for in a comedy, and this film succeeded in doing that--many times, for that matter.",4,"&quot;Honey, you think KFC is still open?&quot;",1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,3092,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'funny', 'goofy', 'quot', 'Old', 'School', 'quot', 'way', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'job', 'done', 'Funny', 'Department', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'picky', 'when', 'comedies', 'As', 'long', 'laugh', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'happy', 'movie', 'made', 'numerous', 'times', 'matter', 'how', 'goofy', 'lame', 'gag.Mitch', 'thought', 'had', 'perfect', 'life', 'came', 'home', 'early', 'one', 'day', 'found', 'girlfriend', 'quot', 'erotic', 'quot', 'pastimes', 'Needless', 'say', 'two', 'break', 'up', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'Now', 'Mitch', 'move', 'out', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'still', 'being', 'broken', 'up', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'friends', 'Beanie', 'Frank', 'are', 'determined', 'get', 'friend', 'be', 'happy', 'again', 'decide', 'best', 'course', 'action', 'starting', 'own', 'fraternity', 'guys', 'may', 'be', 'thirties', 'still', 'know', 'how', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'live', 'up', 'were', 'still', 'college', 'However', 'dean', 'none', 'too', 'happy', 'new', 'quot', 'house', 'quot', 'determined', 'get', 'shut', 'down', 'matter', 'what', 'up', 'very', 'hilarious', 'movie.Directed', 'Todd', 'Philips', 'quot', 'Road', 'Trip', 'quot', 'quot', 'Old', 'School', 'quot', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'comical', 'raunchy', 'course', 'still', 'how', 'be', 'funny', 'going', 'over-the-top', 'scene', 'gag', 'way', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'very', 'entertained', 'entire', '1', 'hour', '32', 'minutes', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'roles', 'really', 'make', 'script', 'work', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'however', 'none', 'other', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'quot', 'Frank', ""'The"", 'Tank', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'half', 'good', 'really', 'how', 'take', 'comical', 'antics', 'limit', 'never', 'afraid', 'try', 'anything', 'new', 'even', 'quot', 'streaking', 'quot', 'neighborhood', 'only', 'be', 'caught', 'new', 'wife', 'moments', 'later', 'movie', 'many', 'elements', 'hilarity', 'most', 'time.The', 'DVD', 'neat', 'features', 'offer', 'One', 'main', 'highlights', 'quot', 'uncensored', 'quot', 'footage', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'shown', 'theatres', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'version', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'added', 'do', 'know', 'extremely', 'outrageous', 'movie', 'can', 'tell', 'why', 'exactly', 'quot', 'uncensored.', 'quot', 'Surprisingly', 'movie', 'offered', 'DTS', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'movie', 'needing', 'hey', ""'m"", 'not', 'complain', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'bloopers', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'more', 'Plenty', 'cool', 'features', 'play', 'around', 'with.I', 'ended', 'up', 'really', 'enjoying', 'quot', 'Old', 'School', 'quot', 'what', 'was', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'enjoy', 'raunchiness', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'will', ""'re"", 'looking', 'just', 'plain', 'ol', 'good', 'time', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'did', 'job', 'made', 'laugh', 'usually', 'look', 'comedy', 'film', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'many', 'times', 'matter']",Old School

Puerile Frank (Will Ferrell) has recently married and may have gotten himself in over his head. And Beanie (Vince Vaughn), their cynical friend who is securely married with children, sees it all as an opportunity to party like they did when they were young. To start anew, Mitch leases a house that happens to be right next to a college campus. At Beanie's urging, the house becomes party central for the nearby college students. In an effort to shut the parties down, the Dean of the university succeeds in having the house zoned for university use only. So the revelers declare themselves a fraternity -an equal opportunity fraternity that will admit any man of any age who wants to pledge. When the conniving Dean comes up with a new plan to shut them down, the guys will have to prove that they are a real fraternity or close their doors permanently.To say that ""Old School""'s humor is sophomoric would be an understatement. ""Old School""'s humor is infantile. The audience is hit over the head with gross-out physical comedy, beer bongs, K-Y jelly wrestling, nudity, and four-letter words. And the film does not apologize for it. ""Old School"" spoofs and celebrates fraternity life. And some of it is funny. But the gags get tiresome, and boredom sets in only a third of the way through the film. It may be the lack of credibility, and therefore sympathy, in the characters. At no point in this film does it make any sense that Mitch is even involved with the fraternity. Or it may be that gross-out jokes fall flat after the first ""oh, gross"". But I found ""Old School"" to be a snooze.I wasn't impressed by any of the main characters, but there are a few supporting roles that may be worth mentioning. I like Juliette Lewis' swinging girlfriend character a lot. Ex-Late Late Show host Craig Kilborn does a very convincing obnoxious womanizer. And Ellen Pompeo jumps off the screen as Mitch's potential love interest, Nicole. The camera loves her, so I think we'll be seeing more of Pompeo in the future.

611662,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,B00005JM1F,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[5, 8]","The boys that brought us ""Road Trip"" are back again with ""Old School"" and it's pretty much what you'd think it would be.THE STORY:Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank (Will Ferrell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) are a bunch of 30-something guys who decide to open up a frat house near their old college campus and pretty much get into all the clich&eacute; frat things to some pretty hilarious results.  Among other things they let in just about EVERYBODY (including an old homeless Vet) into the frat and they take on the crooked college Dean who holds a grudge against them from their old college days.THE COOL THINGS:Overall, the film is what you'd expect.  It's a ""dumb"" comedy and the boys get themselves into some pretty hilarious fixes.  Nothing sophisticated here which is good.  We've got streaking, we've got the sophomoric humor and that's about it.THE NOT-SO-COOL THINGS:Well, given that it's a ""dumb"" comedy as you'd expect, some things are pretty funny and then again, some things aren't all that funny.BEST SCENES:1. The BJ School2. The Tranquilizer Dart3. The ""Exam"" Scene4. The KY Wrestling sceneTHE DVD EXTRAS:As standard for these new DVDs, you've got a truckload of extras.  Like the film itself, some of them are hilarious and some of them aren't.1. ""From the Cutting Room Floor"" - 8 deleted scenes2. ""Old School Orientation"" - 13 minute film synopsis featurette3. ""Inside the Actors Studio Spoof"" - 21 minute spoof of a ""serious"" talk show segment with the main cast and directors, complete with overly dramatic host and canned audience reactions.  It got old after like 4 minutes...4. ""Outtakes &amp; Bloopers"" - 5 minute montage5. Commentary Track6. 3 TV Spots &amp; 1 Trailer from the films promotion7. Sneak Peaks:  Trailers for ""Biker Boyz,"" ""The Fast and the Furious Tricked Out Edition,"" and ""Head of State""8. Photo Gallery9. Cast Bios10. Filmmaker Bios11. Production NotesTHE VERDICT:Well, for a ""dumb"" comedy this is definitely one of the better ones.  It was waaay better than ""Road Trip"" but as with stuff in this genre it's just okay.  You'll get a good laugh and you'll also shake your head a few times too.  Overall, not bad for a weekend rental and if you loved the movie the extras justify this as a pretty good addition to your collection if you're so inclined.GRADES:The Movie:  3  starsThe Extras:  5 starsOverall:  4  starsRecommended if you need a mindless laugh",4,Pretty Funny,1085356800,"05 24, 2004",2004,2391,"['boys', 'brought', 'Road', 'Trip', 'are', 'back', 'again', 'Old', 'School', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be.THE', 'STORY', 'Mitch', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Frank', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Beanie', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'bunch', '30-something', 'guys', 'who', 'decide', 'open', 'up', 'frat', 'house', 'old', 'college', 'campus', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'clich', 'eacute', 'frat', 'things', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'results', 'other', 'things', 'let', 'just', 'EVERYBODY', 'including', 'old', 'homeless', 'Vet', 'frat', 'take', 'crooked', 'college', 'Dean', 'who', 'grudge', 'old', 'college', 'days.THE', 'COOL', 'THINGS', 'Overall', 'film', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'boys', 'get', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'fixes', 'Nothing', 'sophisticated', 'here', 'good', ""'ve"", 'got', 'streaking', ""'ve"", 'got', 'sophomoric', 'humor', 'it.THE', 'NOT-SO-COOL', 'THINGS', 'Well', 'given', 'dumb', 'comedy', ""'d"", 'expect', 'things', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'then', 'again', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny.BEST', 'SCENES:1', 'BJ', 'School2', 'Tranquilizer', 'Dart3', 'Exam', 'Scene4', 'KY', 'Wrestling', 'sceneTHE', 'DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'standard', 'new', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'got', 'truckload', 'extras', 'film', 'are', 'hilarious', ""aren't.1"", 'Cutting', 'Room', 'Floor', '8', 'deleted', 'scenes2', 'Old', 'School', 'Orientation', '13', 'minute', 'film', 'synopsis', 'featurette3', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'Spoof', '21', 'minute', 'spoof', 'serious', 'talk', 'show', 'segment', 'main', 'cast', 'directors', 'complete', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'host', 'canned', 'audience', 'reactions', 'got', 'old', '4', 'minutes', '4', 'Outtakes', 'amp', 'Bloopers', '5', 'minute', 'montage5', 'Commentary', 'Track6', '3', 'TV', 'Spots', 'amp', '1', 'Trailer', 'films', 'promotion7', 'Sneak', 'Peaks', 'Trailers', 'Biker', 'Boyz', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Tricked', 'Out', 'Edition', 'Head', 'State', '8', 'Photo', 'Gallery9', 'Cast', 'Bios10', 'Filmmaker', 'Bios11', 'Production', 'NotesTHE', 'VERDICT', 'Well', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'was', 'waaay', 'better', 'Road', 'Trip', 'stuff', 'genre', 'just', 'okay', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'also', 'shake', 'head', 'few', 'times', 'too', 'Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'weekend', 'rental', 'loved', 'movie', 'extras', 'justify', 'pretty', 'good', 'addition', 'collection', ""'re"", 'so', 'inclined.GRADES', 'Movie', '3', 'starsThe', 'Extras', '5', 'starsOverall', '4', 'starsRecommended', 'need', 'mindless', 'laugh']",Old School

611673,A3U4VUSBJMR5KP,B00005JM1F,Patrick A. Hayden,"[0, 2]","A movie like ""Old School"" should know better than to mess around with a serious plot.  Most college gross-out comedies like this one don't.  Even ""Animal House"", the Gold Standard of college comedies knew enough just to have a plot that led to various gags, concluding with the incredibly funny final act.  All that was just so the guys could mess around.  For the first 2/3rds of ""Old School"", the movie knows enough than to take it's plot too seriously.  And for those 60 minutes, it's low comedy at it's best.The basic plot outline is that Mitch(Luke Wilson) has just broken up with his long time girlfriend when he discovers that well, she's been cheating on him.  Big time.  Anyway, he gets a new house on the outskirts of a college campus, and his friend Beanie(Vince Vaugn, laying on the smarm), who feels trapped in his marriage and REALLY misses college, convinces him to form a frat to allow Mitch to keep his house, which the vengeful college dean(Jeremy Piven, painfully unfunny for the first time ever) wants taken over by the school.  Mitch relents in the face of the needs of his friends, especially Frank""The Tank""(played by Will Ferell in a star-making performance), who just got married but has quickly gotten seperated because he a booze hav a special relationship that some might call addictive, but which Frank considers necessary.Anyway, the start the Frat, with a rogues gallery of pledges, some of whom are not students, such as ""Blue"", played by Patrick Crenshaw, who is just barely outshone by Farell for comic brilliance.  The movie moves from one set of gags to another, mostly howlers that will have you in stitches.  Then, the movie simply stops being that funny.  The plot takes over, and instead of simply being a vessel for more jokes, it takes over completely, with the gags becoming fewer, and the ending being really, really unsatisfying.This was the same problem Writer/Director Todd Phillips had with his first mostly funny film, ""Road Trip"".  There, just towards the end, too much plot takes over, and the ending feels rushed, just like it does in ""Old School"".  While the last frames are funny, the big 20 minute hole in which the plot takes precedence over the jokes hurts the overall ranking for the film.  Also, Phillips can't write women well, and it shows in the opening scene and in Luke Wilson's sort of romance with Ellen Pompano's character.  It's just very weak.The DVD itself, however, does have some great stuff.  The unrated edition has more risque, nasty stuff if you're into that sort of thing(heh), and the disc also has a hilarious bit in which Will Ferell reprises his interpretation of ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" host James Lipton in which he showers the film and actors with praise better suited for a Royal Shakespere Company production of Hamlet.  There are also deleted scenes that are pretty clever.  There is one thing Phillips has been consistantly good at: picking music for the soudtrack.

611676,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00005JM1F,Patrick L. Randall,"[47, 56]","""Old School"" brings back the fun and irreverence of the days of ""Animal House"" that so few movies seem willing to revisit.  Comedy these days seems built around 'paint-by-numbers' formulas or 'let's see how much we can gross people out' shock characteristics.  Current releases like ""Boat Trip"" and ""Bringing Down the House"" fall in the former category while any movie involving Tom Green or the Farrelly Brothers falls into the latter category.  In ""Old School"", it's refreshing to see a movie that takes a 'devil may care' attitude with its plot and characters while also have the common sense to push the envelope where appropriate without ever crossing the line (following ""Animal House's"" lead).In ""Old School"", Mitch (played by Luke Wilson) is depressed after a breakup with his longtime girlfriend.  He moves into a new house near the local college campus and his two best friends, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank 'the Tank' (Will Ferrell) decide to cheer him up by using his new house to throw a wild 'freedom' party.  In a party complete with nubile co-eds, binge drinking, and a performance by Snoop Dogg, the party becomes legendary and draws the ire of the college dean, who just happens to be some nerd that Mitch, Beanie, and Frank tormented in high school.  He attempts to take the house from Mitch by claiming it can only be used for campus-related events.  This sparks Beanie's imagination to create the most unorthodox fraternity in existence to circumvent the dean's ruling.  From there, ""Old School"" engages in the type of 'us against the administration' hi-jinx that made ""Animal House"" such a riot.Will Ferrell gives a performance worthy of John Belushi with his Bluto-esque take as Frank the Tank, whose relapse back into his college days fractures his brand new marriage.  Yet, it doesn't seem to affect Frank too too much.  Ferrell, as witnessed by his years on Saturday Night Live, is one of the more gifted physical comedians performing today.  He has the lunacy of a Jim Carrey without any of the pretentiousness or self-importance that seems to plague Carrey.  Vince Vaughn gives another winning performance as a typical, sleazy salesman type who remains just enough on the side of respectability that you still like the guy.  It's classic Vaughn.  Luke Wilson's performance isn't quite as memorable, but his lovable-loser demeanor fits the role of Mitch perfectly.  There are a number of other supporting characters that, while barely more than one-dimensional, make this film a winner (Blue, the 80-year fraternity pledge is a personal favorite).With world events becoming more somber and depressing and with movies becoming increasingly disappointing, it's quite a relief a no-frills good time can be had at a theater.

I didn't know much about Luke Wilson and Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn, while funny, have never turned out a comedy so hilarious I couldn't describe my feelings.  Well, while this film didn't do that either, it did surprise me.  It was a solid, quite funny story.  For all three men, it's to be listed among their finest works (I've seen Luke Wilson in other movies and TV shows since first seeing this movie.)  The premise of three guys long out of college starting a fraternity may be a stretch, but this cast makes it work and work well.  Even the really old guy who's pledging fits in and Patrick Cranshaw doesn't waste an ounce of talent on frivolous humor.  I did find the subplot with Wilson's love interest a bit distracting at times, but Ellen Pompeo did well and her story ark did actually tie into the main plot at times, so I'll let that go...the scene with the supportive waiter was pretty funny.  In the end, this is a very good, funny movie and, though Will Ferrell was my favorite, all the cast contributed to the plot and its hilarity.

Then at the end it turns into a 1980s Donner film, where a 400-pound kid is suddenly endowed with the ability to flip through the air like an Olympic gymnast, and Will Ferrell's character begins speaking expertly about a political topic he knows nothing about, actually stumping James Carville.

Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn - all of whom are very good in their roles - play a trio of thirtysomething losers who have never really grown up, despite the fact that one of them is married with children, another has just gotten married and the third wants desperately to have a meaningful relationship.  The three come up with a scheme to create an ""unofficial"" fraternity at the local college, giving men of all ages a chance to get away from the rules and restrictions of everyday adult life.Although there are a few undeniably funny moments in the film, ""Old School"" is basically a numbskull comedy filled with junior high-level jokes and pratfalls, some of which work but most of which don't.  Like far too many comedies that advertise themselves as freewheeling, daring and iconoclastic, ""Old School"" ends up literally ""old school"" in the end, coming out foursquare in favor of responsibility, seriousness and conformity.  In other words, it wants us to identify with these juvenile grownups, then turns right around and makes them just like the people they've been going after all along.

If the four hadn't had a history going back to their school days, Dean Pritchard's relentless fight to end the fraternity would've been lost in the mix.Basically, the story revolves around three men who appear to be lost in their post-college years and decide to form a fraternity in the midst of Mitch's failed marriage and Frank's inability to grow into married life. Living in a campus house and overcoming glitches within the system, the fraternity becomes the most popular group on campus to hang out with despite their unusual and questionable personalities. As the film unravels, the fraternity is forced to face real life challenges that test their friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and heart.The chemistry between Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson is fantastic and demonstrates the true bonds of friendship. The casting in this movie was brilliant and made it that much more hilarious. It includes some of the best one-liners you'll hear come out of Hollywood. It ranks alongside, if not above the American Pie trilogy and is a modern day 'Animal House', an absolute must for any college student.The only problem I have with this movie is its length.  Some of the deleted scenes were not only hilarious, but essential to the plot and should've been used in the final cut. However, that's a minor detail in the final outcome.In addition, if you're a fan of Whitesnake or Kansas, this movie is a living homage to your music.Grade: A+",5,We're going steaking!!,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,1817,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'First', 'all', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'regards', 'relationships', 'characters', 'Mitch', 'Nicole', 'Mitch', 'Darcie', 'Bernard', 'Lara', 'most', 'overlooked', 'important', 'detail', 'connection', 'Mitch', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Bernard', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Frank', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Dean', 'Pritchard', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'four', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'history', 'going', 'back', 'school', 'days', 'Dean', 'Pritchard', 'relentless', 'fight', 'end', 'fraternity', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lost', 'mix.Basically', 'story', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'lost', 'post-college', 'years', 'decide', 'form', 'fraternity', 'midst', 'Mitch', 'failed', 'marriage', 'Frank', 'inability', 'grow', 'married', 'life', 'Living', 'campus', 'house', 'overcoming', 'glitches', 'system', 'fraternity', 'most', 'popular', 'group', 'campus', 'hang', 'out', 'unusual', 'questionable', 'personalities', 'film', 'unravels', 'fraternity', 'forced', 'face', 'real', 'life', 'challenges', 'test', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'teamwork', 'heart.The', 'chemistry', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'fantastic', 'true', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'casting', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'hilarious', 'best', 'one-liners', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'alongside', 'not', 'American', 'Pie', 'trilogy', 'modern', 'day', 'House', 'absolute', 'must', 'college', 'student.The', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'length', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'hilarious', 'essential', 'plot', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', 'final', 'cut', 'However', 'minor', 'detail', 'final', 'outcome.In', 'addition', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Whitesnake', 'Kansas', 'movie', 'living', 'homage', 'music.Grade', 'A+']",Old School

It offers a vicarious escape from a mundane, suburban reality for those individuals looking to recapture the days of their elder-adolescence.  It encourages the recently thirty-somethings to embrace their residual immaturity and not abandon their proclivity to party.  It also has obvious value with those still living their elder and younger adolescence.  Story line goes a little something like this:  Dude breaks up with girlfriend and realizes his life has become a cesspool of barbeques and picnics, completely devoid of the reckless abandon he used to thrive off of.  His friends begin marrying off and as a way of reclaiming his more carefree days he moves to a college campus and becomes the founding father of a faux fraternity which doesn't discriminate on age, academic standing, class status, or even being a student.  As their popularity swells they battle for recognition from the university which they find themselves loosely affiliated, while the sinister dean plots to ka bash their senseless shenanigans.  Through out their plight there's a continual stream of comedic antics that carry an otherwise sluggish plot.  Its success and popularity are a direct result of combining and expanding upon the recent comedic successes of movies like American Pie, Van Wilder, and Office Space.

611688,A13910TC3NZ6LE,B00005JM1F,Sam Bethune,"[5, 6]","First off, a word of warning to those who haven't seen the unrated version of Old School...the menu screen features topless girls.  Not that I'm a prude or anything like that, but it might be a good idea to send younger children out of the room BEFORE you put it in the DVD player.Having said that, I feel it is necessary to address the comments of one customer reviewer who asked how anyone could dare to compare Old School to the classic Animal House and complained that the plot had been &quot;done before&quot;.  As to the first complaint, it should be noted that Old School was produced by Ivan Reitman, who has been associated with a number of great comedies in the last few years, including Animal House.  As to the second, I must respectfully disagree.  The notion of some thirty somethings starting their own fraternity has not to my knowledge been done before, although this movie is somewhat derivative of college comedies such as National Lampoons Van Wilder and PCU.The basic plot of Old School is simple enough-three 30somethings played by Vince Vaughn, Will Farrell, and Luke Wilson decide to relive their college days by starting their own fraternity.  All three actors are in top form here, even Wilson, who is cast against type as a straight man.  But it's Vaughn's performance as the group's leader that really makes Old School funny.  Jeremy Piven, also cast against type, is the uptight dean of the college who carries a grudge because he was picked on by Wilson's Farrell's and Vaughn's characters when they were younger.  Much like Animal House's Dean Wormer, he tries to get the frat tossed off campus but is unsuccessful.While Old School isn't quite as funny as Animal House, it is certainly worth watching as it carries on the comedy tradition set by that film, although the formula is slightly different.",4,Good Comedy; Be Careful With the Unrated DVD Version,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,1831,"['First', 'off', 'word', 'warning', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'unrated', 'version', 'Old', 'School', 'menu', 'screen', 'topless', 'girls', 'Not', ""'m"", 'prude', 'anything', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'send', 'younger', 'children', 'room', 'put', 'DVD', 'player.Having', 'said', 'feel', 'necessary', 'address', 'comments', 'one', 'customer', 'reviewer', 'who', 'asked', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'dare', 'compare', 'Old', 'School', 'classic', 'Animal', 'House', 'complained', 'plot', 'had', 'been', 'quot', 'done', 'quot', 'first', 'complaint', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Old', 'School', 'was', 'produced', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'who', 'been', 'associated', 'number', 'great', 'comedies', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'including', 'Animal', 'House', 'second', 'must', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'notion', 'thirty', 'somethings', 'starting', 'own', 'fraternity', 'not', 'knowledge', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'derivative', 'college', 'comedies', 'such', 'National', 'Lampoons', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'PCU.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Old', 'School', 'simple', 'enough-three', '30somethings', 'played', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'decide', 'relive', 'college', 'days', 'starting', 'own', 'fraternity', 'three', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'even', 'Wilson', 'who', 'cast', 'type', 'straight', 'man', 'Vaughn', 'performance', 'group', 'leader', 'really', 'Old', 'School', 'funny', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'also', 'cast', 'type', 'uptight', 'dean', 'college', 'who', 'grudge', 'was', 'picked', 'Wilson', 'Farrell', 'Vaughn', 'characters', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'Much', 'Animal', 'House', 'Dean', 'Wormer', 'get', 'frat', 'tossed', 'off', 'campus', 'unsuccessful.While', 'Old', 'School', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'Animal', 'House', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'comedy', 'tradition', 'set', 'film', 'formula', 'slightly', 'different']",Old School

There is little message, just laughs.

Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) moves into a college house and is talked into starting a fraternity by his friends.The movie was great. The comedy was brilliantly unpredictable.

To sum it up, Vince Vaughn, Will Farrell, and Luke Wilson start a fraternity in the midst of female problems in order to save Wilson's character from losing his house.

Will Ferrell's frantic yelling, Luke Wilson's quiet acceptance of his life, and Vince Vaughn's adamant holding-on to being a partying bachelor made Old School a comedy classic when it came out just a few short years a go. In the vein of Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, the story focused on an unlikely group of guys on a college campus: grown up men who aren't even going to the school.The story begins when Mitch (Wilson) loses his cheating girlfriend. His friends, Frank (Ferrell) and Beanie (Vaughn) hatch a plan to get career-oriented Mitch back into the social world; they rent him a house on-campus, and turn it into the most high-profile fraternity (complete with Snoop Dogg concert) around.Compared to every other college-oriented comedy since the 80s, Old School was a breath of fresh air. The film finally seemed to realize that there's more to humor than gross-out jokes and physical humor, combining drama, likable characters, and memorable scenes all with the type of humor people have come to expect from a movie starring Will Ferrell. Putting the emphasis on a man in his 30s who's not even in college also is a fresh move, as it allows for exploring more than just getting good grades, or fitting in with peers. Thanks to Mitch's age and current status, Old School is not only a movie about the college frat life, but also about mid-life in general. What would a real 30-year-old man do if he found himself in Mitch's shoes, homeless with a new frat house, girl-less with dozens of sorority sisters throwing themselves at him, and friends trying their hardest to live like they were still young and not married? Most likely, they'd do exactly what Mitch does.Old School may not be as funny as other films by its stars, but it's still a fantastic movie full of humor, memorable moments, quotable lines, and lovable characters. The trio of Vaughn, Ferrell, and Wilson offer some of their best performances here, and it's a treat to watch again and again.Score: 4/5THE DISCOld School is one of those movies filmed for high-def transfer before it became a standard, so while the transfer is high-def, it's not quite at a level as other films since then. The 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 encode looks, to my eye, almost identical to the HD DVD release Old School originally saw. Compared to the DVD, there's a better clarity to textures and more noticeable details, but nothing that will blow you away going, ""Wow, this is the power of Blu-ray!""For a comedy movie like Old School that has no huge catalog of action scenes or graphically impressive feats, the transfer is a solid one. It's much better looking than the DVD, but once again, nothing you'd want to show off your home theater set-up with.Unlike the video, the audio in the Blu-ray release is an improvement over the HD DVD version as it offers TrueHD 5.1 surround. Unfortunately, the surround is very rarely noticed given it's a dialog-heavy movie that is, once again, light on the effects. Only during a few scenes (the first party; the competition at the end; the classic fight between Mitch, Frank and the Dean) is the surround actually noticeable without looking for it.One area where the disc suffers is in the features department. With all of the DVD releases of Old School over the years, it looks like DreamWorks just didn't have anything new to bring to the plate. (And, to make matters worse, all features are in standard definition.) If you've already cleared the features on your DVD release(s) of the film, you'll find nothing new to take your time here. What is here is still entertaining, but it looks like they're officially dried up.For those who don't own one of the DVD releases, Old School on Blu-ray contains an audio commentary featuring Vaughn, Ferrell, and Wilson (along with director Todd Phillips). The commentary isn't something for film students, as most of the stars' time is spent riffing on one another than discussing the film, but if you're a fan of MST3K or any of the three actors involved, chances are you'll like it.The other features are a little more entertaining for all audiences. First, there's the obvious deleted and extended scenes collection. With 8 scenes and 13 minutes of runtime, there are a few gems hidden on here. To go along with those, there's a 5 minute outtakes and blooper real. Oddly enough, compared to many it's rather lackluster. Perhaps the best (actually, it IS the best) feature on the disc is the Inside the Actor's Studio spoof with Will Ferrell reprising his SNL role of James Lipton. In it, ""Lipton"" interviews Vaughn, Ferrell, and Wilson about Old School. If you've ever seen Will's SNL skits with the overanalytic windbag that is Lipton, you'll love this.Score: 2.5/5VERDICTIn the end, whether or not you buy Old School on Blu-ray depends on several questions. Do you already own the movie on DVD? If you do, is it worth the price to upgrade to Blu-ray for HD picture? And if you don't, is HD picture and audio important enough to you that you'll spend $20 instead of picking up a used/new copy of the DVD for under $10? If you don't mind spending the extra cash, Old School is a great movie and the Blu-ray transfer is a very serviceable one. For most people, though, a film of this type with no new Blu-ray extras to speak of will likely be good enough on DVD with upscaled presentation.Overall Score: 3/5",3,School is back in

However, as I continued to watch, I began to wonder if I was seeing the same movie everyone else saw.Now, I do tend to favor a different type of comedy, namely the Christopher Guest movies &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;, &quot;Best in Show&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;, but there have been a decent amount of what one would call low brow comedies that I have enjoyed.  I liked the Austin Powers movies and &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;, I even liked &quot;Half Baked&quot; with all its stupidity, but &quot;Old School&quot; was just a dud.  The jokes and gags all had a oddly familiar feel to them, like I had seen them already many times over, and they had lost their appeal a long time ago.  Even the turn of events in the movie, with the cliched &quot;mean dean of the college&quot; and the against all odds ending didn't come off as funny but rather as tired and overused.There really isn't much more to say about &quot;Old School&quot;, I mean, it's not like it warrants an in depth analysis of its &quot;plot&quot;. To me, it's just a movie that failed to do what it was supposed to do, namely making me laugh.",1,Just Not Funny,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,1471,"['know', 'am', 'minority', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'had', 'laughed', 'exactly', 'two', 'times', 'time', 'was', 'certainly', 'expected', 'evening', 'quot', 'gut-busting', 'quot', 'laughter', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'considering', 'single', 'person', 'talked', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'However', 'continued', 'watch', 'began', 'wonder', 'was', 'seeing', 'same', 'movie', 'everyone', 'else', 'saw.Now', 'do', 'tend', 'favor', 'different', 'type', 'comedy', 'namely', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'movies', 'quot', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'quot', 'quot', 'Best', 'Show', 'quot', 'quot', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'quot', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'amount', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'low', 'brow', 'comedies', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'liked', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'movies', 'quot', 'Something', 'Mary', 'quot', 'even', 'liked', 'quot', 'Half', 'Baked', 'quot', 'stupidity', 'quot', 'Old', 'School', 'quot', 'was', 'just', 'dud', 'jokes', 'gags', 'had', 'oddly', 'familiar', 'feel', 'had', 'seen', 'already', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'lost', 'appeal', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Even', 'turn', 'events', 'movie', 'cliched', 'quot', 'mean', 'dean', 'college', 'quot', 'odds', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'funny', 'rather', 'tired', 'overused.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'say', 'quot', 'Old', 'School', 'quot', 'mean', 'not', 'warrants', 'depth', 'analysis', 'quot', 'plot', 'quot', 'just', 'movie', 'failed', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'namely', 'making']",Old School
611708,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B00005JM1F,T O'Brien,"[2, 2]","Old School is a very funny movie that is a throwback to Animal House starring John Belushi.  The movie is about three friends in their thirties all struggling to realize that they're getting older so they start a fraternity on a college campus.  Seeing that they cause so much trouble and that many members don't even go to the school, the evil dean steps in and tries to revoke the charter.  Some scenes will have you rolling around on the ground in tears they are so funny.  The iniation with the cinder blocks, picking up the pledges, and the school spirit routine with Will Ferrell in the mascot suit are all hysterical.The cast for Old School is surprisingly good.  Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughan are very good together throughout.  Wilson plays the straight man although he has several funny scenes.  Ferrell is great through the whole movie as Frank the Tank.  His streaking scene and his inspirational speech, a la John Belushi, are two of the funniest scenes in the movie.  Vaughan's speech at Frank's wedding is also very good as he tries to convince him not to get married.  Juliet Lewis, Craig Kilborn, Andy Dick, and Sean William Scott all make basically cameos, but are all very good.  William Scott as a white trash animal holder is very good as Ferrell shoots himself in the neck with a heavy duty tranquilizer.  The Unrated DVD Special Edition doesn't offer much that is different from the movie that was shown in theaters.

611711,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JM1F,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","OLD SCHOOL is a comedy that stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell. Wilson portrays Mitch Martin, a real estate lawyer who arrives home early from a business training seminar to find his wife about to participate in an orgy. This break off their relationship and Mitch finds himself alone again and moving into a house on the campus of the local university. Meanwhile Frank Richard (Will Ferrell), one of Mitch's best friends, is getting married. The other part of the trio, Bernard &#34;Beanie&#34; Campbell (Vince Vaughn) tries convincing Frank not to get married right up until Frank's bride arrives at the altar. Beanie has a successful business and is married to a very attractive women and has a couple of kids, but he's feeling trapped. The Dean of the University, Dean Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Piven) threatens to seize Mitch's house, but Beanie discovers a loophole in the seizure clause and Beanie, Frank, and Mitch turn the house into a new fraternity that is open to men of all ages in the community, including those who have no association with the university whatsoever. A battle between the new fraternity and the dean ensues, while in the meantime the three founding fathers of the fraternity face relationship struggles of their own with the women they love.OLD SCHOOL includes allusions to many movies, but seems to have been most heavily influenced by ANIMAL HOUSE and FIGHT CLUB and seems to be a homage to both of those films. The ANIMAL HOUSE allusions are obvious, e.g. popular fraternity that the dean tries to close down. The FIGHT CLUB references aren't quite as obvious, but they are there and there are many. For example, the wrestling matches take place in the basement, club propaganda is photocopied at work, the men appear disheveled at work, in many of the fraternity scenes Vince Vaughn dresses in outfits similar to those of Tyler Durden, etc. In fact director Todd Phillips has said that he thought of OLD SCHOOL as being a comedy version of FIGHT CLUB.With such a talented cast and a witty script full of film references, one would think that OLD SCHOOL would be a memorable and hilarious movie. Unfortunately, it's not. There were some parts of OLD SCHOOL that I found incredibly funny. For instance, watching Will Ferrell streak through a party and run naked down a public street was hilarious. In fact, Ferrell is the funniest thing about the movie. Just about every time he is on screen I found myself laughing at the antics of his character. I also enjoyed Luke Wilson's performance. Wilson portrays Mitch as a very likeable, down-to-earth, and realistic person. However, Ferrell and Wilson are about the only two characters who work well in the movie. Vince Vaughn can speak almost as fast as an auctioneer, but his character just doesn't fit with the rest of the characters in the film. Jeremy Piven is a very talented actor, but in OLD SCHOOL I don't believe that his character used to be the guy that Mitch, Beanie, and Frank used to beat up and neither do I believe that was able to rise through the ranks of academia to become the university dean. Most of the women in the movie are only background characters that are used as fodder for comic material. There are a variety of scenes in the movie that seem funny at first, but are juvenile at best and then quickly become boring and dull. There are many sexual references in the movie that have very little to do with the plot and seem basically to have been thrown in simply to have thirteen-year-old males buy movie tickets or the DVD. The movie had a lot of potential, but it doesn't come together in a coherent manner.However, with the movie on DVD, one can get a better understanding of what the movie could have been. Some of the extras on the DVD include the usual director's commentary, a spoof of &#34;Inside the Actor's Studio&#34;, deleted and extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes, and a making of featurette. Most of the deleted and extended scenes that are included on the DVD probably should have been kept in the movie because they add a great deal to the characterization and plot development. For instance, there is a scene where a college girl wants to sleep with Beanie, but he refuses. The scene in the movie makes Beanie seem like a complete jerk while the extended scene allows the audience to relate to Beanie and actually see him as a human being. I really enjoyed watching most of these scenes and they allowed me to appreciate the movie a bit more. The other special feature that I really liked was the &#34;Inside the Actor's Studio spoof&#34;. I found it hilarious; seeing Will Ferrell have a conversation with himself as two different characters is hilarious.Overall, OLD SCHOOL is a movie that will probably appeal most to teenage males and some college students as well as fans of Ferrell, Wilson, or Vaughn. Other than that, I'd skip this comedy and watch ANIMAL HOUSE instead.",3,Poor Comedy Homage,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,4920,"['OLD', 'SCHOOL', 'comedy', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Will',

611714,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00005JM1F,wellwellwell,"[38, 42]","I just saw this movie about three hours ago, and I have to say it is the best movie I've seen in the theater in a long, long time.  The starring cast is unbelievable, as Luke Wilson (from 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and 'Legally Blonde'), Will Ferrell (SNL funnyman/'A Night At The Roxbury' star), and Vince Vaughn (from both 'Made' and 'Swingers') star as three married buddies who begin a fraternity; or something like it.  And along with the three stars, there's a great list of supporting roles and cameos.  Including Sean William Scott (Stifler of 'American Pie'), Andy Dick, CBS Late Late Show's Craig Kilborn, and Jeremy Piven.  And once you get past the long cast list, you have a very funny movie.  As the movie starts, you get a glimpse of each of the three stars and their lives; as far as their marriages go.  Then as it turns out, none of them are really happy.And as Mitch (Luke Wilson) gets divorced and moves into a frathouse near a college, they decide to start a fraternity.  But it's not like any old club on campus--for this one you don't even have to go to the college.  Anyway, as the film roles on, you can imagine what (and if you saw the previews, you get the gist of it) they do.  They drink, party, and slowly drift away from the lives they have with their wives.  And I have to say, out of the three star performances, Vince Vaughn's was the best.  Will Ferrell's certainly is the funniest, but Vince was great.  He sort of carries in the same swagger-style he had in the riotous movie 'Made'; something that works very well for him.  I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that the previews don't even begin to prepare you.  It's definitely not one of those movies that is only funny in the previews.  The laughs portrayed there are multiplied by 100, at least.For those of you who saw 'Road Trip' you'll not be let down with 'Old School'.  And being that it's from the same director (Todd Phillips), that makes sense.  But this one is better.  Much better.  This time around the director takes it to a whole new level.  And the characters are more well-rounded here than they were in 'Road Trip'.  The slogan of the movie says it all: ""All the fun of college.  None of the education.""  I think that speaks for itself.So I could leave you here saying that if you liked 'Road Trip' you will like 'Old School'; and that's it.  But that's not true.  This is not just a ""teen cult"" movie--or whatever they're calling it these days--it's much much more than that.  It's a hilarious movie with an astonishing/almost too hilarious cast that will keep you laughing even through the closing credits (courtesy of Ferrell and Vince).  And it's not every day I put an exclamation point on my review titles, much less two.  I gave the movie 5 stars because that's what it deserves.  It's a 5 star movie, there's not getting around it.

This movie is, simply put, absolutely hilarious, and it's got lots of brains and heart to go with the goofball humor.  I'm not really into lowbrow comedies, but ""Old School"" is a very intelligent take on the typical fratboy fare.  The humor is goofy, but witty at the same time, and there are even some real emotions on display.  The plot revolves around three thirtyish friends who start up a fraternity with some local college students, and it gets a nonstop stream of laughs out of the idea of guys trying to reclaim some of their lost youth.  Will Ferrell is especially great as the loopy Frank, whether he's shooting himself with a tranquilizer dart at his friend's son's birthday party, setting himself on fire trying to jump through a hoop, or belting out an unforgettable rendition of Kansas's ""Dust in the Wind"" at the funeral of an elderly pledge.  The underrated Luke Wilson makes a perfect straight man as Mitch, and Vince Vaughn is the picture of intensity as Beanie.  It's really too bad this movie doesn't seem to be getting much attention.  I don't go to the movies much anymore, but this one was more than worth the trip.",5,"Some good, unclean fun",1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,1245,"['was', 'expecting', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'Old', 'School', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'something', 'THIS', 'good', 'movie', 'simply', 'put', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'got', 'lots', 'brains', 'heart', 'go', 'goofball', 'humor', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'lowbrow', 'comedies', 'Old', 'School', 'very', 'intelligent', 'take', 'typical', 'fratboy', 'fare', 'humor', 'goofy', 'witty', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'even', 'real', 'emotions', 'display', 'plot', 'around', 'three', 'thirtyish', 'friends', 'who', 'start', 'up', 'fraternity', 'local', 'college', 'students', 'nonstop', 'stream', 'laughs', 'idea', 'guys', 'trying', 'reclaim', 'lost', 'youth', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'especially', 'great', 'loopy', 'Frank', 'shooting', 'tranquilizer', 'dart', 'friend', 'son', 'birthday', 'party', 'setting', 'fire', 'trying', 'jump', 'hoop', 'belting', 'out', 'unforgettable', 'rendition', 'Kansas', 'Dust', 'Wind', 'funeral', 'elderly', 'pledge', 'underrated', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'perfect', 'straight', 'man', 'Mitch', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'picture', 'intensity', 'Beanie', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'much', 'attention', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'much', 'anymore', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'trip']",Old School

While there were several hilarious scenes -- Will Ferrell streaking through the streets of town to name one -- the overall laughs were not as many and somewhat trite.

(And that's being nice.) The director, who's also the co-writer, has absolutely no idea how to create interesting characters, get them to interact in an amusing manner appropriate the the plot, or ""build"" the story to a comic catharsis. It's like listening to an early Dvorak symphony -- good ideas, poor development. Todd Phillips is a ""talent"" on the level of John Hughes.If you were hoping the unrated version included NC-17 material, forget it. There's nothing that goes beyond the R rating of the theatrical release. And the end credits include a gratuitous scene in which two of the ""bad"" characters die in a gruesome freak accident.If you want a genuinely funny movie about college life, try ""Animal House,"" ""Back to School,"" or ""Real Genius."" Heck, ""Amadeus"" is a _lot_ funnier, and it isn't even _billed_ as a comedy.So, why is this DVD is a ""must-buy""? Have you seen ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" on Bravo? The host, James Lipton, is one of the most pompous, nauseatingly fawning intellectual jerks ever to walk the planet -- even worse than Dick Cavett. One of the DVD extras is a devastatingly nasty send-up of the show, with ""Old School""'s director and the three principal actors a Lipton look-alike's guests.
