Not to mention the lead actress appears on the cover in a string bikini. So what the average viewer expects is a romantic comedy with lots of bounce and jiggle.  However, the flesh factor here is miniscule.Even though this film is ""unrated,"" it's not because of racy content. This film is a weak ""R"" at the very worst... but the reality is this is a strong PG-13.You were warned.",1,"WARNING!

Two 30 something year old men looking for love in Miami, that behave like they should be in high school. The actors are all decent but none are leads they would all be great character actors and nothing more. The Italian family is a mockery and insulting to Italians.

954444,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B000C20VMI,Danielle Turchiano,"[1, 4]","Well, if you're a fan of Krista, Kristin, Chris, or Brad (all of whom are underrated and underworked), you should check out this film because they are all really funny in it.  From Krista's wacky Italian accident, to Chris' equally wacky facial expressions, all four of the primary cast prove they have a knack for physical comedy.  However, the film itself lacks the production value needed to cut it with the rest of Hollywood's standards. For one thing, many of the shots are soft focus-- almost to the point of being just plain blurry-- which I don't believe was intentional: it looks like the Assistant Cameraman missed his mark while pulling focus one too many times. Also, the tone is not consistent throughout: there are moments that are full of lowbrow comedy and then moments that drag and bore as the sort-of-chuckle gets played to death. The lighting is often mismatched and overdone--much like a network three-camera sitcom. The soundtrack is superb, though, with three original hits from Ana Lovelis. This is an independent film at its very core: it was written and produced by two complete newcomers to the film world, and that shows. A nice first time effort, but very much an amateur film. It's almost surprising it brought in the name talent (and DP) that it did.",3,"Great Cast, Lackluster Film",1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,1281,"['Well', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Krista', 'Kristin', 'Chris', 'Brad', 'whom', 'are', 'underrated', 'underworked', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'Krista', 'wacky', 'Italian', 'accident', 'Chris', 'equally', 'wacky', 'facial', 'expressions', 'four', 'primary', 'cast', 'have', 'knack', 'physical', 'comedy', 'However', 'film', 'production', 'value', 'needed', 'cut', 'rest', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'one', 'thing', 'many', 'shots', 'are', 'soft', 'focus', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'just', 'plain', 'blurry', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'intentional', 'Assistant', 'Cameraman', 'missed', 'mark', 'pulling', 'focus', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Also', 'tone', 'not', 'consistent', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'full', 'lowbrow', 'comedy', 'then', 'moments', 'drag', 'bore', 'sort-of-chuckle', 'played', 'death', 'lighting', 'often', 'mismatched', 'overdone', 'much', 'network', 'three-camera', 'sitcom', 'soundtrack', 'superb', 'though', 'three', 'original', 'hits', 'Ana', 'Lovelis', 'independent', 'film', 'very', 'core', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'two', 'complete', 'newcomers', 'film', 'world', 'nice', 'first', 'time', 'effort', 'very', 'much', 'amateur', 'film', 'almost', 'surprising', 'brought', 'name', 'talent', 'DP', 'did']",Shut Up and Kiss Me

Even the mob guys that they used were over-the-hill mob guys that had some heft (pun perhaps not intended) in the 80s but are slated as b-movie actors now. The leading characters, particularly the two males, are, as one reviewer noted, underworked and underappreciated.If this had been made two decades ago, it might have reached cult status. Who knows? There are worse movies with such status made back then.This reviewer lived through the '80s and has no desire to revisit them in the form of a poorly made film.

954448,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000C20VMI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 9]","As a curiosity, I watched this film to check out Krista Allen and Brad Rowe--two performers that in the right material could break out of relative obscurity.  While I wasn't expecting much, unfortunately I got just that--not much.  A juvenile comedy, ""Shut Up and Kiss Me"" has the great distinction to feature grown men acting like twelve year olds.  On a perennial search for love, two kids (um, I mean bachelors) equate sexual attraction for feelings and we're meant to buy into these ""love"" stories. Absolutely brain-dead and overcooked, this isn't the movie for me.Every gag that can be overplayed is.  There are the fart jokes, breast jokes, virginity jokes, homophobic jokes--it's all here.  Usually, this type of sophisticated humor would be in a high school films such as ""Porky's""--but here, our lead character is an investment manager.  Needless to say, the film knows absolutely nothing about the subject.  There is a ridiculous mob subplot, as well, which is best left to your imagination.I don't want to spend too much time on this one, but a final thought....What's interesting to me is that it's easy to dismiss a movie of this caliber when it is fairly unknown to begin with.  If, however, this exact same movie was marketed by a big studio and headlined Ryan Reynolds, for example, there would absolutely be people who thought it was hysterical.  Most bad movies are inoffensive enough, and this movie is slight and inconsequential.  But a bad movie raised to popular acclaim and big box office--that's what really offends my senses.",1,"Too Bad ""Shut Up"" Didn't Take It's Own Advice",1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,1550,"['curiosity', 'watched', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'Krista', 'Allen', 'Brad', 'Rowe', 'two', 'performers', 'right', 'material', 'could', 'break', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'unfortunately', 'got', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'A', 'juvenile', 'comedy', 'Shut', 'Up', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'great', 'distinction', 'feature', 'grown', 'men', 'acting', 'twelve', 'year', 'olds', 'perennial', 'search', 'love', 'two', 'kids', 'um', 'mean', 'bachelors', 'equate', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'feelings', ""'re"", 'meant', 'buy', 'love', 'stories', 'Absolutely', 'brain-dead', 'overcooked', ""n't"", 'movie', 'me.Every', 'gag', 'can', 'be', 'overplayed', 'are', 'fart', 'jokes', 'breast', 'jokes', 'virginity', 'jokes', 'homophobic', 'jokes', 'here', 'Usually', 'type', 'sophisticated', 'humor', 'would', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'films', 'such', 'Porky', 'here', 'lead', 'character', 'investment', 'manager', 'Needless', 'say', 'film', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'subject', 'ridiculous', 'mob', 'subplot', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'left', 'imagination.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'one', 'final', 'thought', '.What', 'interesting', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'caliber', 'when', 'fairly', 'unknown', 'begin', 'however', 'exact', 'same', 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'big', 'studio', 'headlined', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'example', 'would', 'absolutely', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'hysterical', 'Most', 'bad', 'movies', 'are', 'inoffensive', 'enough', 'movie', 'slight', 'inconsequential', 'bad', 'movie', 'raised', 'popular', 'acclaim', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'what', 'really', 'senses']",Shut Up and Kiss Me
