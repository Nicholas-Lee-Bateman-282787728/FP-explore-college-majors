I had never seen any of the previews so I had no expectations other than liking Andie MacDowell's work.First, the scenery of this movie is absolutely gorgeous.  I can't remember the name of the town where they filmed, but if you watch the extras, they will tell you.The acting is really good.  Like many movies, this one isn't perfect.  Some scenes seem implausible, and the twist in the movie is unexpected.  But I've read through some of the other reviews and I still think that the twist isn't a reason to write off the whole movie.  There are sad parts, and some people think that a sweet woman like MacDowell's character Kate would never be friends with the women in the film.  But in real life, how many of us have friends that seem really great but when you look closely you can see that they're selfish or arrogant?  I know I have.  And it isn't always a reason to cut them out of your life.  So I found that portion to be a good element to the story.  I found the character of Janine far less likely as a high-powered law enforcement officer who is intimidated by her friend.  But again, it wasn't a factor that spoiled the movie.Overall, this may not be a warm fuzzy in which no matter what, everything is coming up roses at the end. But personally, those movies seem far less realistic.  There is great acting, beautiful backgrounds, and plenty of funny moments.",5,"Not a classic US chick flick, but still a great movie",1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,1435,"['picked', 'up', 'whim', 'one', 'day', 'living', 'England', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'previews', 'had', 'expectations', 'other', 'liking', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'work.First', 'scenery', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'town', 'where', 'filmed', 'watch', 'extras', 'will', 'tell', 'you.The', 'acting', 'really', 'good', 'many', 'movies', 'one', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'scenes', 'seem', 'implausible', 'twist', 'movie', 'unexpected', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'still', 'think', 'twist', ""n't"", 'reason', 'write', 'off', 'whole', 'movie', 'are', 'sad', 'parts', 'people', 'think', 'sweet', 'woman', 'MacDowell', 'character', 'Kate', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'friends', 'women', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'many', 'have', 'friends', 'seem', 'really', 'great', 'when', 'look', 'closely', 'can', 'see', ""'re"", 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'always', 'reason', 'cut', 'life', 'found', 'portion', 'be', 'good', 'element', 'story', 'found', 'character', 'Janine', 'far', 'less', 'likely', 'high-powered', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'who', 'intimidated', 'friend', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'factor', 'spoiled', 'movie.Overall', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'matter', 'what', 'everything', 'coming', 'up', 'roses', 'end', 'personally', 'movies', 'seem', 'far', 'less', 'realistic', 'great', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'backgrounds', 'plenty', 'funny', 'moments']",Crush
708377,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00006ADD0,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 9]","This quirky chick comedy tries to take itself seriously, then has second thoughts and reverses itself, losing all credibility in the process.  Kate (Andie MacDowell) is a forty-something headmistress of a private school.  She and her friends Janine (Imelda Staunton) and Molly (Anna Chancellor) spend much of their time drinking and telling ribald war stories about their exploits with men.  When Kate takes a tumble with twenty-something Jed (Kenny Doughty), their fling turns into a romance that turns a bit too serious for her friends' sensibilities.Their plot to break up the lovers goes terribly wrong, creating a rift between Kate and her friends.  Serious melodrama ensues as the light hearted comedy becomes ponderously morose.  Then suddenly, inexplicably and incongruously everything is fine again and it is like nothing ever happened.  The story is cute in the beginning, but loses believability after it makes the first somber twist.  The melodrama is realistic, but the reconciliation is utterly implausible.Andie MacDowell delivers an excellent performance.  She is light and breezy in the romantic parts and forcefully emotional in the dramatic scenes.  She conjures a believable character, but the script makes her look loopy because she makes so many obviously foolish choices.  Imelda Staunton steals the show with a droll presentation.  Staunton is unabashedly honest and blase as she delivers one outrageous zinger after the other.  Anna Chancellor is adorable as the police chief, and she looks like a little munchkin next to the towering Staunton and MacDowell, creating constant visual comedy by contrast.  Kenny Doughty is mostly window dressing, a Brad Pitt clone without many lines.  His entire job consists of being sexy and irreverent, which he accomplishes without much trouble.This film is destined for a long run on Lifetime.  It will play a lot better with women than men.  Despite some good performances, the screenplay leaves one rolling one's eyes in disbelief.  I rated it 6/10.

708378,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00006ADD0,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","CRUSH is now a ten year old film written and directed by John McKay, a film that stands up well with the passage of time and the observations of feminine behavior.  It is blessed with a fine cast of actors and has the courage to take a comedic start and turn it into a tragic mode without destroying the main theme of the special friendship among a small group of women.Kate Scales (Andie MacDowell) is a headmistress of a private school in a smallish English town and is close friends with policewoman Janine (Imelda Staunton) and physician Molly Cartwright (Anna Chancellor): each of the women is in the 40s range of age and each is single, their social life is meeting together for booze, smoking, and gossip and competing by putting themselves down for having the worst faux pas with men.  Kate encounters a young former student of hers, Jed Willis (Kenny Doughty) as he plays the organ for funerals.  There is a mutual attraction and soon they are having a frequent physical relationship.  Jed is sincerely in love with Kate but Kate feels the 20 some odd year difference in their ages in an insurmountable gap - though she is passionately attracted to Jeb. When Kate shares her 'affair' with Molly and Janine her friends are appalled and set out to destroy a relationship they feel is completely wrong and doomed to failure.  Molly and Janine take extreme measures to see to it that the couple is broken up and their intentions result in a tragedy they all must face. The repercussions of this behavior creates a whole new set of circumstances and despite the tragic elements the friends are able to reunite by film's end - with very clear discoveries about each other and changes in each of their lives.There is a lot of well written and well delivered humor in the first half of the film with the trio of women creating a bond that seems to be ceaselessly entertaining. The introduction of Jed - played to perfection by the very talented Kenny Doughty - changes the theme of the story and while many viewers will feel negative about the turn of events there is here a chance for the examination of the spectrum of friendship that is solidly written and performed.  What seems to be a bit of fluff movie develops into a psychological study that makes it stand above many other 'chick flick' comedies.

No one is saying that all 40 year old women are desperate, sleazy, selfish and stupid. However, these three certainly are. Now, if that is a valid subject for a film is another question.....One of the things that movies used to do, but seem to have forgotten how, is to show characters grow and change. When two people meet and fall in love, please, let us see some aspect of what sparks their attraction. But no more. What this couple sees in each other is never clear. I'm not doubting, I'm just wondering. We never see them together unless they are copulating or sharing coy glances. What do they talk about? What do they do when they ahe their clothes on? And they, like the busy doctor and the high-ranking police woman, sure seem to have lots of free time....I have always found Andie MacDowell wildly over-rated. I bought the hype all those years ago and saw ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" and found her uninteresting and unconvincing. ""Groundhog Day"" was a great film in spite of, not because of, her. Nothing I've seen her in was improved by her wooden and stilted delivery. And here she is so totally implausible as the headmistress of a school that you are almost forced to laugh. Not a ******* chance, guys. This silly woman has no drives other than libido and ego, no manifestation of intellect other than bookshelves full of nice old books, and no ability to lead anyone anywhere except to her crotch.

708381,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00006ADD0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 7]","I was not familiar with ""Crush"" previously--but with Andie MacDowell, Imelda Staunton, and Anna Chancellor as the stars, I decided to give it a try.  It is a surprisingly well made picture with some very nice performances.  Ostensibly billed as a romantic comedy, the movie tries to be too many things to too many people.  With a shifting focus and tone throughout, it isn't wholly successful and some of it's parts have more impact then the overall film does.The film begins as a genial buddy comedy, shifts a bit into a surprisingly mean spirited romantic comedy, then into a heavy drama, and back into warm lightheartedness.  It's a bit uneven, which is unfortunate because there are a lot of great qualities within this picture.  I can't help but think that if ""Crush"" hadn't been quite so schizophrenic--maybe been a light romantic drama with comedic elements--I would have loved this movie.By far the most successful element within ""Crush"" is the romance.  I'm not typically known for my soft heart, but I found the relationship formed between Andie MacDowell and Kenny Doughty very believable and well done.  MacDowell is a school headmistress, and Doughty a former pupil--so there is about a 20 year age difference between them.  From the tentative flirting, to the sexual liaison, to the discovery of real love--I thought these two were great.  Had the whole picture been focused on this story, I'd have been with it wholeheartedly.However, there is a mean streak to these characters as well.  And while this isn't totally unbelievable, I found it somewhat unnecessary.  Anna Chancellor, especially, as MacDowell's best ""friend"" doesn't believe this May/December romance will work.  So she is so malicious, unsupportive and destructive--it's hard to imagine rooting for these two to remain friends.  Skepticism is one thing, evil is another.Overall, ""Crush"" is worth a look.  Had the plot and some of the over-the-top elements been scaled back, the movie had true potential.  As is, the uneven tone keeps me from giving it more than 3 stars.

708385,A2887J6P8VPB5H,B00006ADD0,Nichomachus,"[0, 2]","Recently seeing GREEN CARD led to me borrowing this from the library, where I had been ignoring it. Andie MacDowell is a fabulous, underreated actress. She has that smile that hits a man like a truck. The other two lead actresses, Imelda Staunton (the Police Inspector) and Anna Chancellor (the golddigging GP) are also fine as the English best friends of MacDowell, an American headmistress at an English prep school (an obviously improbable combination). All three do well with what they are given, but this movie flounders in its own confusion. It doesn't know what to be; the little comedy there is is poorly written, the melodrama is more than excruciating, and basically the thing just doesn't hang together.Writer/Director John McKay could have used a better editor, both of the film and of the script. A little outside criticism from some well meaning friends may have made the thing more coherent. He tries to synthesize a screwball cartoonish essence with a sappy ""growth through emotional turmoil and healing"" thing that never seems to work. From the credits, McKay adopts a great comic style (reminiscent of Wes Anderson), using hard cuts and thematic music to introduce the characters to us that is excellent, but that flavor of ironic spontaneity is promptly lost, never to return.The relationship between the three women never even rises to the level of its own clich?, so its scheming quality and eventual breakdown is obnoxious and never either believable or amusing, being neither dramatic nor comic. MacDowell's relationship with the kid was annoying more than anything. It never seemed like a real relationship. I found him to be a rather odious little fellow, and fairly stupid. Thus I kind of rooted for her friends in trying to break it up. However, Chancellor's character was underwritten and cartoonish, thus her subsequent behavior, when McKay is awkwardly trying to turn it into a drama, is merely ridiculous.Ultimately, the film is as superficial and two-dimensional as the characters, and mainly through underdevelopment. Oh well. Too bad. Life goes on.

It's like someone took the stereotypical British reserve and tried (hugely unsuccessfully) to blend it with mawkish sentimentality normally associated with Hollywood blockbusters of this ilk.Kate, Molly and Janine are all man-trashing, wine-swilling best buds, and when Kate finds romance with a man 20 years her junior, her 'friends', convinced this is a bad idea, do everything in their power to attemot to convinve her otherwise. The plot goes from predictable, to ridiculous, and back to predictable again, with very little room in between for anything worthwhile or redeeming.MacDowell, Staunton and Chancellor are very fine actresses, so why their performances cannot save this terrible film from the festering recesses of Mundane is something I still haven't worked out. They each give decent turns as their respective characters but thanks to pedestrian editing and a ridiculous plotline, their performances are overshadowed.It's partly the fault of a plot that isn't sure if wants to be a romantic drama, a screwball comedy or a portrayal of the evil nature of humanity. Why would Chancellor go so far as to seduce MacDowell's new lover in order to prove his unsuitability? Why would Staunton stay happy as a clam inthe background, offering neither advice nor caution to either of her so-called friends? All the good acting in the world couldn't save these huge idiosyncratic discrepancies from themselves.The script is merely pedestrian, and the direction, forgettable. Even the most ardent followers of the 'Chick-Flick' genre will be hard-pushed to find any redeeming features in 'Crush' to warrant spending your hard-earned cash on it.

The first half is reasonably engaging, as we follow the anxious exploits of a 40-something headmistress (played with sincerity by modeling's most famous plainjane, Andie McDowell) who falls first in lust and then in love with a man 15 years her junior.  Their romance survives a series of trials and tribulations, including the general disapproval of the locals, but not the interference of her suspicious friends, one a sweet but mousy cop and the other a pushy doctor whose mean-spirited plan to out the boyfriend as a philanderer leads to senseless tragedy.  Getting a handle on just what the movie is saying is tough--on one hand, it's about eschewing convention for true love, but, alas, that never actually happens, as the romance ends abruptly.  There are the expected and cliched nods to sisterhood, motherhood, and the joys and pains of living, as well as a creepy subtext that men are really only necessary for sex and procreation.  (Driving the point rather clumsily home is the fact that the doctor, a masculine horse of a woman, comes to realize she doesn't need men at all; her character also plays into a rather ugly sexual stereotype.)  There's nothing particularly wrong about the performances, cinematography or the score of ""Crush,"" but the film suffers from relying too much on semi-realized moments of female bonding to make up for a story that goes off in several directions without really getting anywhere.
