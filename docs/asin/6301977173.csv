Some of the songs aren't quite outstanding but nothing is below ""okay"".  Some of the songs, such as the beautiful Charlie Pride ballad used as the theme song, really get to me since the writer of the song was able to encapsulate part of what Twain was doing with this material.  Whitaker as Tom, who I grew up watching in Family Affair and Sigmund & the Seamonsters (where's the complete series release of Sigmund anyway?!), shows some talent for this material and Jeff East as Huck is about perfect.  I'm always left with a good feeling as the credit roll and happy I picked up this DVD to replace a lacking VHS I recorded.With that said, this DVD is mediocre and in need some a new release.  This film represents kid's musicals of the time, along with Oliver!, etc, and should get more respect than MGM has done here.  That's not to say the VHS is better, not by a long shot.  Many shots are just fine, others have a graininess that was probably always there, but with some work this could be a cleaned up widescreen print that would make us fans happy.  Probably won't ever get it...but if it ever comes (blu ray would be nice!) then they will sell at least one copy of it to me.

286137,A3FHSLWEMH7JD8,6301977173,"Elizabeth G. Melillo ""gloriana""","[15, 26]","This film is definitely not for anyone who is especially fond of the independent, delightfully manipulative and clever boy who was the brain child of Samuel Clemens's classic.As one example, the book has great  fun with the scenes involving Aunt Polly, a simple minded soul who thinks  herself quite clever, and the genuinely shrewd Tom, who plays on catering  to Polly's illusions about her own wit. This is a far cry from beautiful,  intelligent Celeste Holm's portrayal of Polly - and the family's poverty,  clearly seen in the book, disappears, as the Sawyers occupy a beautiful  home and are close friends with wealthy Widow Douglas.Some of the plot  is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original. Tom's taking  off to &quot;play pirates&quot; after Becky jilts him is changed into a  troubled kid's escape after Aunt Polly tells him how &quot;no good&quot;  his father was - the humour, and the engaging portrayal of adolescent  &quot;first love&quot; is gone. The theme of Tom's learning responsibility  is overworked, and sequences that are hilarious in the book (Sunday school,  classroom, etc) are largely left out. The enchanting Becky Thatcher is  reduced to a tomboy. And isn't much of the picnic sequence ruined when a  gathering of kids is changed to a song-and-dance outing for families? (Tom  Sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more  concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let's not turn it  into a commentary on &quot;family values&quot; a la 1990s political  correctness.)Johnny Whitaker's singing voice has all the appeal of  chalk squeaking on a blackboard. His rendition of &quot;If I Were God&quot;  (aside from its text having nothing to do with the story - Tom's only  church interests are in time to play with his pinch bug) is pure purgatory  for the listener.",2,The best of Mark Twain's work - left out!,958089600,"05 12, 2000",2000,1847,"['film', 'definitely', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'especially', 'fond', 'independent', 'delightfully', 'manipulative', 'clever', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'brain', 'child', 'Samuel', 'Clemens', 'classic.As', 'one', 'example', 'book', 'great', 'fun', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'simple', 'minded', 'soul', 'who', 'quite', 'clever', 'genuinely', 'shrewd', 'Tom', 'who', 'catering', 'Polly', 'illusions', 'own', 'wit', 'far', 'cry', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'portrayal', 'Polly', 'family', 'poverty', 'clearly', 'seen', 'book', 'Sawyers', 'occupy', 'beautiful', 'home', 'are', 'close', 'friends', 'wealthy', 'Widow', 'Douglas.Some', 'plot', 'distorted', 'ways', 'remove', 'charm', 'original', 'Tom', 'taking', 'off', 'quot', 'play', 'quot', 'Becky', 'jilts', 'changed', 'troubled', 'kid', 'escape', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'how', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'father', 'was', 'humour', 'engaging', 'portrayal', 'adolescent', 'quot', 'first', 'love', 'quot', 'gone', 'theme', 'Tom', 'learning', 'responsibility', 'overworked', 'sequences', 'are', 'hilarious', 'book', 'Sunday', 'school', 'classroom', 'etc', 'are', 'largely', 'left', 'out', 'enchanting', 'Becky', 'Thatcher', 'reduced', 'tomboy', ""n't"", 'much', 'picnic', 'sequence', 'ruined', 'when', 'gathering', 'kids', 'changed', 'song-and-dance', 'outing', 'families', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'quite', 'realistic', 'setting', 'forth', 'kids', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'concerned', 'fretting', 'parents', 'let', 'not', 'turn', 'commentary', 'quot', 'family', 'quot', '1990s', 'political', 'correctness', 'Johnny', 'Whitaker', 'singing', 'voice', 'appeal', 'chalk', 'squeaking', 'blackboard', 'rendition', 'quot', 'Were', 'God', 'quot', 'text', 'having', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'Tom', 'only', 'church', 'interests', 'are', 'time', 'play', 'pinch', 'bug', 'pure', 'purgatory', 'listener']",N/A

It carries a top notch cast with Johnny Whitaker, Celeste Holm, Warren Oates, Jeff East, and Jodie Foster in one of her breakout films of her career!MGM released this on Laserdisc in the 80's.  That transfer was great for the limited medium of the laserdisc.  It did include the original overture, and ""exit music.  It was also presented in the wide screen format.  With the DVD format able to present programs with many different formats, why MGM pulled this transfer for release on dvd boggles the mind.  I attempted to write emails to MGM home video to express my feelings about this release, however, no reply.As a film, it is top notch entertainment.  Filmed on location on the Mighty Mississippi River, I give the film 4 stars.  This poor transfer is what is rated here.  The film makers deserve much better, Especially Don Taylor and the cinematographer Frank Stanley.  The Laserdisc transfer did have the film's audio remixed into stereo, as well as updated color restoration.  It would be great to see this film transferred into wide screen, and ""re-mastered"" for the new dvd formats available.  Ironically, cable network Turner Classic Movies broadcast this movie in the wide screen format (July, 2010).The question as to who to write to is confusing.  MGM/UA home video is distributed by 20th Century Fox Video, but they still keep the release label under the MGM/UA label.

286143,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,6301977173,Mark Baker,"[1, 1]","I hadn't heard of this 1973 movie version of the classic Mark Twain story until recently, but I absolutely had to see it.  After all, it had music by the Sherman Brothers (best known for their work in Mary Poppins).  And I love a good musical.The book stays very true to the novel.  Tom Sawyer (Johnny Whitaker) is a young boy growing up in 1840's Hannibal, Missouri.  An orphan, he's being raised by his Aunt Polly (Celeste Holm).  And he is quite the handful.  He regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East).  He constantly lies to get out of trouble, too.Through this movie, we watch as Tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery.  He tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him.  And he develops a crush on new girl Becky Thatcher (a young Jodie Foster).  But will Injun Joe (Kunu Hank) get his sworn revenge on the boy?This movie is extremely faithful to the book, hitting all the highlights of the classic.  Frankly, that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going.  Once I got into the story, I was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale.  The scenery and costumes recreate the times well.  And the acting was pretty good.Unfortunately, I found the songs disappointing.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good either.  They aren't especially memorable or singable, and they don't really advance the story.  I would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs.Despite that rather major flaw for a musical, I must admit to enjoying it.  It has a sweetness and innocence that I enjoyed.  And the songs are easy to overlook since they aren't a major part of the movie.

He lives with his frustrated Aunt Polly and her children, goody-goody Sid, who has it in for Tom, and lovely Mary, who is Tom's only supporter when he gets himself into trouble. Tom's best friend is Huckleberry Finn, an outsider who lives off the land and water and has no one to look after him. The two boys love to fish, go swimming, play pirates on the river, and hang out with their pal, Muff Potter, the friendly town drunk. The days pass pretty much regularly like that for Tom, Huck, and their friends. That is, until two people shake up their world. One is a sweet little girl named Becky Thatcher, the daughter of the new judge in town. When Tom meets Becky, it's love at first sight. Unfortunately, the other disruption in the lives of Tom and Huck is not quite as benign. The menacing figure known as Injun Joe makes more than a little trouble for the boys when they witness him murdering the town doctor one night in the graveyard and putting the blame on poor Muff Potter! It suddenly becomes Tom's difficult decision of whether or not to break his pact of secrecy with Huck and save their innocent, drunken friend from the gallows!If you are a fan of Mark Twain's delightful tales of boyhood adventure, AND if you love a good family musical, look no further than 1973's ""Tom Sawyer.""

I had vague memories of seeing parts of it on the Disney Channel as a kid, and I finally picked it up on DVD at my local retailer for under 5 dollars. True, the DVD is in full screen, and it's also true that it cruelly teases us by presenting the trailer (the only extra feature) and film credits in widescreen(and this movie screams widescreen!), but for a price like that, it's worth picking up until a definitive edition comes along! The songs are fantastic! Naturally, it's the Sherman brothers! They do a wonderful job of capturing the feelings and situations of Mark Twain's classic characters! They're catchy too! You'll be singing them in your head long after the movie is over! The performances are top notch as well! Johnny Whitaker is exactly what I would think a young Mark Twain might have looked like, and he's perfect for the role of Tom, full of energy, scheming, and stretchers. Jeff East is wonderful as Huckleberry. Now, I'm dying to see him reprise the role in the sequel that came out a year later! Of course, everyone loves little Jodie Foster, here taking on the important role of Becky Thatcher. Celeste Holm and the rest of the cast are terrific too, but I'm going to name Warren Oates as my favorite in the lovable role of Muff Potter and with the highly enjoyable song ""Man's Gotta Be (What He's Born To Be)."" Of course, the story stays mostly true to what we've seen before on the screen, but the outstanding job done here in adapting ""Tom Sawyer"" into a musical version takes it to a whole new level! Perhaps the 1938 David O. Selznick version is still the best straight interpretation of the story (and I admit that Disney's 1995 teenie-bopper version, ""Tom and Huck,"" is a guilty pleasure, but I LOVE Rachael Leigh Cook) , but if you're looking for something with a little extra ""oomph,"" try out 1973's musical masterpiece, ""Tom Sawyer.""",5,A Glorious Experience!,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,3615,"['Tom', 'Sawyer', 'rascally', 'young', 'boy', 'doing', 'best', 'grow-up', 'carefree', 'mischievous', 'banks', 'Mississippi', 'River', 'Hannibal', 'Missouri', 'frustrated', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'children', 'goody-goody', 'Sid', 'who', 'Tom', 'lovely', 'Mary', 'who', 'Tom', 'only', 'supporter', 'when', 'trouble', 'Tom', 'best', 'friend', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'outsider', 'who', 'land', 'water', 'one', 'look', 'two', 'boys', 'love', 'fish', 'go', 'swimming', 'play', 'pirates', 'river', 'hang', 'out', 'pal', 'Muff', 'Potter', 'friendly', 'town', 'drunk', 'days', 'pass', 'pretty', 'much', 'regularly', 'Tom', 'Huck', 'friends', 'two', 'people', 'shake', 'up', 'world', 'One', 'sweet', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Becky', 'Thatcher', 'daughter', 'new', 'judge', 'town', 'When', 'Tom', 'Becky', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Unfortunately', 'other', 'disruption', 'lives', 'Tom', 'Huck', 'not', 'quite', 'benign', 'menacing', 'figure', 'known', 'Injun', 'Joe', 'more', 'little', 'trouble', 'boys', 'when', 'witness', 'murdering', 'town', 'doctor', 'one', 'night', 'graveyard', 'putting', 'blame', 'poor', 'Muff', 'Potter', 'suddenly', 'Tom', 'difficult', 'decision', 'not', 'break', 'pact', 'secrecy', 'Huck', 'save', 'innocent', 'drunken', 'friend', 'gallows', 'are', 'fan', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'delightful', 'tales', 'boyhood', 'adventure', 'love', 'good', 'family', 'musical', 'look', 'further', '1973', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'MGM', 'Studios', 'featuring', 'wonderful', 'music', 'Disney', 'Sherman', 'Brothers', 'conducted', 'John', 'Williams', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'treat', 'anyone', 'sense', 'adventure', 'mischievous', 'fun', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'movies', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'one', 'years', 'had', 'vague', 'memories', 'seeing', 'parts', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'kid', 'finally', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'local', 'retailer', '5', 'dollars', 'True', 'DVD', 'full', 'screen', 'also', 'true', 'cruelly', 'presenting', 'trailer', 'only', 'extra', 'feature', 'film', 'credits', 'widescreen', 'movie', 'widescreen', 'price', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'definitive', 'edition', 'along', 'songs', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Naturally', 'Sherman', 'brothers', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'capturing', 'feelings', 'situations', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'classic', 'characters', ""'re"", 'catchy', 'too', ""'ll"", 'be', 'singing', 'head', 'long', 'movie', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'as', 'well', 'Johnny', 'Whitaker', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'young', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'perfect', 'role', 'Tom', 'full', 'energy', 'scheming', 'stretchers', 'Jeff', 'East', 'wonderful', 'Huckleberry', 'Now', ""'m"", 'dying', 'see', 'reprise', 'role', 'sequel', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'later', 'course', 'everyone', 'little', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'here', 'taking', 'important', 'role', 'Becky', 'Thatcher', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'terrific', 'too', ""'m"", 'going', 'name', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'favorite', 'lovable', 'role', 'Muff', 'Potter', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'song', 'Man', 'Got', 'ta', 'Be', 'What', 'Born', 'Be', 'course', 'story', 'mostly', 'true', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'outstanding', 'job', 'done', 'here', 'adapting', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'musical', 'version', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Perhaps', '1938', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'version', 'still', 'best', 'straight', 'interpretation', 'story', 'admit', 'Disney', '1995', 'teenie-bopper', 'version', 'Tom', 'Huck', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'LOVE', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'extra', 'oomph', 'out', '1973', 'musical', 'masterpiece', 'Tom', 'Sawyer']",N/A

The sound is terrible too, and it was terrific on the laser disc in 5.1 surround.  You're missing the wonderful, detailed orchestrations by John Williams of the tuneful Sherman Brothers score.

The songs are surprisingly good in this film. All of them are catchy, memorable and have clever lyrics. I don't know why this movie is so obscure today, seeing as how it has a stellar cast including Celeste Holme as Aunt Polly, Johnnie Whitaker as Tom, and a young Jodie Foster as Becky. Whitacker is perfect in the role with his wild red hair. I especially love the famous white washing scene, which, in this movie, has a great song called ""Gratifaction"" to go along with it. The film is full of laughs, too, due to great supporting characters like the lovable drunk, Muff Potter, the local busybody, the Widow Douglas, and the trouble-making Huck Finn.

I was shocked to see my widescreen smile go to a fullscreen frown in minutes. I then read the back of the box and realized the error of MGM's ways. Had I took the time to read this in the store I doubt I would have bought it, though in hindsight who knows when another issue will be made, I'll likely ditch this and get that when it does. The best part about this release (and most important) is the sound anyway, and WOW they squeeze a lot of mileage out of Stereo Surround! I then rechecked the box to see if this was 5.1 and it wasn't but man oh man you'd never guess it twasn't! The picture is grainy on certain shots, others it is clear and bright, and it bothers me there ain't a whisker of an extra, but I guess that's for the ""special edition"". 2/5On with the show!I really like this movie and always have. Being brought up on it I guess it's almost forced, almost like a religion, but watching this as an adult you certainly appreciate different things about the movie. I see Aunt Polly is VITAL to this movie, her lone performance raises this to another level. Celeste Holm was superbly cast! Johnny Whitaker in my mind IS Tom Sawyer however during casting I am surprised more thought wasn't put into casting a Tom that could, umm, you know, sing a note:) Jeff East as Huck has always been solid and Warren Oates as Muff Potter still shines. Watching this as full-grow'd man I do have regrets that more footage wasn't shot between the glorious Jody Foster's Becky and Johnny's Tom. That chemistry is almost scary considering it's comin' from young'ns. And who could forget the PC incorrect staggerin', ""Injun Joe?!"" He haunted us all but now we just sit back and laugh... gulp, I didn't mean to say that JOE!!
