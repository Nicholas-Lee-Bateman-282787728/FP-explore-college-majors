I didn't think that I was familier with the show but as I was watching it I actually remembered seeing some of the episodes when I was a kid back in 19...  cough cough ). Need I say that as I was watching, I saw WHY I didn't remember it. It's bad and not even the funny kind of bad, it's just the irratating kind of bad.

1111236,A3DQBSA9YPD8GZ,B000WPJT1E,Doug,"[0, 0]","This is a classic 1950's early western.  Jim Davis of Dallas fame is the lead character, a railroad detective.  He is mirrored by a female sidekick that does a pretty good job of being relevant. This is not deep plot material, the guns don't match the time period and the time period bounces all over the place from the civil war to the late 1870s.  The plots try to mimic real events but only barely.  Hangings, executions and shootings are commonplace and Jim Davis plays a tough gritty character who also does the narration. I gotta say this is no Gunsmoke or Rawhide, but not a bad show to watch on a rainy day.",5,Tough guy,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,615,"['classic', '1950', 'early', 'western', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'Dallas', 'fame', 'lead', 'character', 'railroad', 'detective', 'mirrored', 'female', 'sidekick', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'relevant', 'not', 'deep', 'plot', 'material', 'guns', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'time', 'period', 'time', 'period', 'bounces', 'place', 'civil', 'war', 'late', '1870s', 'plots', 'try', 'mimic', 'real', 'events', 'only', 'barely', 'Hangings', 'executions', 'shootings', 'are', 'commonplace', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'tough', 'gritty', 'character', 'who', 'also', 'narration', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'Gunsmoke', 'Rawhide', 'not', 'bad', 'show', 'watch', 'rainy', 'day']",N/A
