Don't get me wrong:  the entire concert is well concieved and all.  But I feel the thing as kind of a ""rush rush"" job just to put more cash in ALW's already hefty pockets and nothing else.  Unlike most other Broadway programs, which seem to contain and evoke more passion.Nevertheless, MASTERPIECE does contain some awesome highlights; and by this regard, is at least worth a look.Elaine Page is, as always,  very good here; her voice just seems to shine.  Kris Phillips, on the other hand, while an alright singer, didn't impress me at all in this show.  Music of the Night, for example:  he literally seems to strain and tense up through the entire song; exhibiting neither emotion nor depth.He has a good voice.  It's just obvious here that Broadway is not his forte.It is up to you to buy Masterpiece or not.  For me, it's not worth it; there is so much better stuff out there:  Hey! Mr. Producer, the Lloyd Webber 50th birthday show, Michael Ball at Royal Albert Hall, the Les Mis concert, etc.Perhaps I have higher standards than some when it comes to musical theater.  But to me, MASTERPIECE isn't that great of a concert.",3,Alright ... Not One of the Best ...

As far as I got it seemed like they just picked the noisiest Lloyd Webber tunes and pranced and shouted them.  It all started off with a glowing cross and JC Superstar.  It was a drag.  Sondheim is a mediocre hack (his one song is ""Send in the clowns""), but at least he's quiet.  Never did like Bway, though I grew up on OBC albums.  Just some songwriters (Rodgers & Hart, Porter, Berlin, Gershwin without his dreadful brother Ira, a little Jule Styne but not much, he was mostly Tin Pan Alley and movies anyway until I think ""High button shoes"").  Bway shows are long and creaky and back-breakingly boring.  And with the exceptions I mentioned, it's all children's music anyway.  Sondheim is nothing; ALW does/did have some talent.  But it's all children's music.  Some pretty or catchy tunes if you're lucky, but mostly blah to terrible.  With the exceptions I mentioned.  A few (like Kern or Hoagy Carmichael or Frank Loesser) got off some good tunes, but not enough to qualify them for the big time.  Loesser started out as strictly a lyricist, then with ""Praise the lord and pass the ammunition"" (hardly a gem, but a WWII hit, and he liked it) began writing his own music.  But with only 3 hit shows (unless you count that awful ""Most happy fella"") and a few stray pop tunes, hardly a full canon.  One last note.  America did not invent the musical comedy.  It just diluted it.  About this ALW DVD.  It is drab and loud and the one slow tune I heard (""I don't know how to love him"") was sung with a very weak ineffectual voice.  The voice that yelled Superstar and the song from Joseph wasn't weak and ineffectual though.  Just colorless and LOUD!  It reminded me of an aging Gruberova.  ""Roberto Devereaux.""  2 females dressed like something out of ""How to succeed in business..."" YELLING Donizetti.  Or Ethel Merman.  At least she had some personality.  So much shop talk about Bway.  I hate it.  Only 3 musicals I ever saw I did not hate were 2 by Rodgers and 1 by Coward.  I saw the other ALW special (his 50th birthday), all rock and religion.  But if I were tied to a pole and had to choose which to be subjected to, I would take the 50th birthday DVD.  More musical, more colorful.  But I hated and didn't finish it too.",1,Lousy,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,2282,"['Loud', 'raucous', 'barren', 'forced', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'As', 'far', 'got', 'seemed', 'just', 'picked', 'noisiest', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'tunes', 'pranced', 'shouted', 'started', 'off', 'glowing', 'cross', 'JC', 'Superstar', 'was', 'drag', 'Sondheim', 'mediocre', 'hack', 'one', 'song', 'Send', 'clowns', 'least', 'quiet', 'Never', 'did', 'like', 'Bway', 'grew', 'up', 'OBC', 'albums', 'Just', 'songwriters', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'Porter', 'Berlin', 'Gershwin', 'dreadful', 'brother', 'Ira', 'little', 'Jule', 'Styne', 'not', 'much', 'was', 'mostly', 'Tin', 'Pan', 'Alley', 'movies', 'anyway', 'think', 'High', 'button', 'shoes', 'Bway', 'shows', 'are', 'long', 'creaky', 'back-breakingly', 'boring', 'exceptions', 'mentioned', 'children', 'music', 'anyway', 'Sondheim', 'nothing', 'ALW', 'does/did', 'have', 'talent', 'children', 'music', 'pretty', 'catchy', 'tunes', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'mostly', 'terrible', 'exceptions', 'mentioned', 'few', 'Kern', 'Hoagy', 'Carmichael', 'Frank', 'Loesser', 'got', 'off', 'good', 'tunes', 'not', 'enough', 'qualify', 'big', 'time', 'Loesser', 'started', 'out', 'strictly', 'lyricist', 'then', 'Praise', 'lord', 'pass', 'ammunition', 'hardly', 'gem', 'WWII', 'hit', 'liked', 'began', 'writing', 'own', 'music', 'only', '3', 'hit', 'shows', 'count', 'awful', 'Most', 'happy', 'fella', 'few', 'stray', 'pop', 'tunes', 'hardly', 'full', 'canon', 'One', 'last', 'note', 'America', 'did', 'not', 'invent', 'musical', 'comedy', 'just', 'diluted', 'ALW', 'DVD', 'drab', 'loud', 'one', 'slow', 'tune', 'heard', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'love', 'was', 'sung', 'very', 'weak', 'ineffectual', 'voice', 'voice', 'yelled', 'Superstar', 'song', 'Joseph', 'was', ""n't"", 'weak', 'ineffectual', 'though', 'Just', 'colorless', 'LOUD', 'reminded', 'aging', 'Gruberova', 'Roberto', 'Devereaux', '2', 'females', 'dressed', 'something', 'How', 'succeed', 'business', 'YELLING', 'Donizetti', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'least', 'had', 'personality', 'So', 'much', 'shop', 'talk', 'Bway', 'hate', 'Only', '3', 'musicals', 'ever', 'saw', 'did', 'not', 'hate', 'were', '2', 'Rodgers', '1', 'Coward', 'saw', 'other', 'ALW', 'special', '50th', 'birthday', 'rock', 'religion', 'were', 'tied', 'pole', 'had', 'choose', 'be', 'subjected', 'would', 'take', '50th', 'birthday', 'DVD', 'More', 'musical', 'more', 'colorful', 'hated', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'too']",N/A

In some ways this is the musical equivalent of the new version of ""Karate Kid"".  While neither qualifies as great, the location seems to pump up the enjoyment.  Elaine Page is clearly the star here and she even gets a warmer reception than Fei Xiang (Kris Phillips) from the mostly sedate Chinese audience.  The rest of the singers are certainly competent but no one else really stands out, performing Webber's better known songs from his now familiar musicals.  I was also a bit surprised to see the orchestra was composed locally and they are really very good.

The selection was slightly different from the norm, but that was good, because almost all the songs were my favorites.  The British company sang very well. I thought the Chinese female singer needed to project her voice a bit more.  I find Chinese who sing Western operas, are not able to project their voices while singing.

This is just some concert they did in China and it's not even a show, just some nerds singing songs is what I call it. Without a doubt, Webber is a cool cool dude, but this was horrible! The special features show the cast going on a hiking trip on the great wall of China. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO WITH ANDREW LLOYD WEBBEER??? And it's so bad, they had to throw in a free CD that sucks just as much as the DVD. if you see an Andrew Lloyd Webber show, make sure it has costumes, sets and that kind of stuff.
