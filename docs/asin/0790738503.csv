Because of this, I vowed NOT TO SEE IT!All right...granted, this movie has a marvelous cast, and even boasted a cameo role for Patrick Macnee (the first -- no, make that the REAL John Steed), but this was just another case where a great cast does not necessarily a good movie make.Well, I kept my vow for all these years, but finally broke down and recently watched The Avengers, the movie.OUCH!Even Sean Connery couldn't pull this one out of the dumpster!  It was painful.  I was only able to suffer through half of it before I had to eject the disk in self defense!  To cleanse myself, I watched three straight hours of the REAL Avengers immediately.If you are tempted to watch this travesty because you fancy one of the stars...DON'T.

I waited with much anticapation when I started to see photos of the film.  Then came the trailer.  WOW!  I couldn't wait  to see the film.  But to find out that the folks at Warner Bros. didn't let  advanced sneak peek for critics to see this, you knew something was wrong.  So there I was waiting to see this and found out how horrible the reviews  were.  When I finally saw the movie I thought scenes were missing.  What  does this mean?  We were jipped!  False advertising from the WB!  The  movie to my mind is OK, but all the missing scenes were in the darn  trailer!  There were really absurd moments (the Teddy Bears were the  funniest to the audience at the theater).  I thought the worst was the lack  of explanation for Bad Emma.  How did she come to be?  The original Steed,  Patrick Macnee reduced to being invisible?  It'd been great to see the two  Steeds side by side.  Uma was OK but sure looked uncomfortable doing a  British accent.  She looked great in the leather outfit though!  Ralph as  Steed I thought was the best acting in film.  Seemed a more silent, maybe  dark Steed?  Connery as the villain was OK but his objections should've  been more realistic.  The Alice character seemed to me the highlight of  this film for something that worked.  The movie did seem to be a combined  mixture of a couple Avenger episodes. But to adapt it as the 1960's was  wrong. They should've put it into the 1990's.

I suspect one reason there was a negative reaction to this film was because many people missed the original series. The original series was before my time, so I had nothing to miss so to speak.Moving on, the movie tries to create a 60s feeling, and to a great deal they succeed. We see John Steed gradually walk through a series of 'obstacles' to test his spy abilities. Uma Thurman and John Steed meet, and right away, we see that Uma Thurman does not always play by the established rules. We are lead to believe that Uma Thurman has sabotaged her own project, and of course we know that that is a little too obvious. So, Mrs Peel and John end up working together to find the real problem.We then meet Sean Connery who carries some charm and is obviously very intelligent. But he shows his dark side as well. Moving on, we see that Connery's plan is to control the world with his weather controlling device. (Alright. A bit cliche. But this is a 60s recreation, so a bit of the cliche was probably inevitable.) Also worth mentioning is that all the nations of the government are fighting and bickering at the crucial moment and accomplishing nothing. Sean Connery walks in and announces his intentions to control the world. And of course they continue to argue and bicker uselessly. There is something utterly hilarious about how Sean Connery silences the politicians very simply: ""Oh...DO SHUT UP!""I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But there is a nice 60s charm; there is the right amount of action; the right amount of story; and a nice amount of internal trouble where we should feel safe; and the comedy is well balanced too. And the final showdown between John Steed and Sean Connery is very well done. Also worth mentioning is that John Steed and Mrs Peel work together well without stomping over each other.Another character I feel obliged to mention is 'Mother.' Rather than being the cliche behind the scenes man, he seems to know that things aren't always what they seem; he is open to reason and the finding of the truth; and when he discovers the truth, he tries to save Mrs. Peel, even though he is old and injured. It's also worth mentioning that at one point he refuses to believe that Steed and Peel have simply vanished, and he sends out a rescue party. (The kind, benevolent, open to reason boss, who knows when he has to face the danger. And just the right touch of being fatherly.)If you are expecting the original series, you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you are willing to see this in its own light, it's really a nice film. Also a great way to have a 60s night!My advice is to at least give it a chance.",5,At Least Give It A Chance,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2740,"['know', ""'m"", 'minority', 'really', 'did', 'love', 'movie', 'suspect', 'one', 'reason', 'was', 'negative', 'reaction', 'film', 'was', 'because', 'many', 'people', 'missed', 'original', 'series', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'time', 'had', 'nothing', 'miss', 'so', 'speak.Moving', 'movie', 'create', '60s', 'feeling', 'great', 'deal', 'succeed', 'see', 'John', 'Steed', 'gradually', 'walk', 'series', ""'obstacles"", 'test', 'spy', 'abilities', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'John', 'Steed', 'meet', 'right', 'away', 'see', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'not', 'always', 'play', 'established', 'rules', 'are', 'lead', 'believe', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'sabotaged', 'own', 'project', 'course', 'know', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'So', 'Mrs', 'Peel', 'John', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'together', 'find', 'real', 'problem.We', 'then', 'meet', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'who', 'charm', 'obviously', 'very', 'intelligent', 'dark', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'Moving', 'see', 'Connery', 'plan', 'control', 'world', 'weather', 'controlling', 'device', 'Alright', 'A', 'bit', 'cliche', '60s', 'recreation', 'so', 'bit', 'cliche', 'was', 'probably', 'inevitable', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'nations', 'government', 'are', 'fighting', 'bickering', 'crucial', 'moment', 'accomplishing', 'nothing', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'walks', 'announces', 'intentions', 'control', 'world', 'course', 'continue', 'argue', 'bicker', 'uselessly', 'something', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'how', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'politicians', 'very', 'simply', 'Oh', 'DO', 'SHUT', 'UP', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'nice', '60s', 'charm', 'right', 'amount', 'action', 'right', 'amount', 'story', 'nice', 'amount', 'internal', 'trouble', 'where', 'should', 'feel', 'safe', 'comedy', 'well', 'balanced', 'too', 'final', 'showdown', 'John', 'Steed', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'John', 'Steed', 'Mrs', 'Peel', 'work', 'together', 'well', 'stomping', 'other.Another', 'character', 'feel', 'obliged', 'mention', ""'Mother"", 'Rather', 'being', 'cliche', 'scenes', 'man', 'know', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'what', 'seem', 'open', 'reason', 'finding', 'truth', 'when', 'truth', 'save', 'Mrs.', 'Peel', 'even', 'old', 'injured', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'one', 'point', 'believe', 'Steed', 'Peel', 'have', 'simply', 'vanished', 'out', 'rescue', 'party', 'kind', 'benevolent', 'open', 'reason', 'boss', 'who', 'when', 'face', 'danger', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'being', 'fatherly', 'are', 'expecting', 'original', 'series', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'willing', 'see', 'own', 'light', 'really', 'nice', 'film', 'Also', 'great', 'way', 'have', '60s', 'night', 'My', 'advice', 'least', 'give', 'chance']",N/A

I am old enough to have seen the original TV series the first time around and while I remember it fondly, it was definitely a product of its time. What makes this film so enjoyable for me is that it is not merely trying to copy the old series but to reinvent it. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are John Steed and Emma Peel this time around. No they aren't Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg nor should they try to be. They have created their own version of the characters and they work quite well together. Their overwritten dialogue is overplayed with just the proper restraint. Sean Connery as Sir August, the principal villian, seems to be underplaying his role until you notice his eyes. Watch the eyes of all the characters. They are an important motif throughout the movie. Jim Broadbent's liquid eyes as ""Mother"" are full of knowledge and sympathy while Fiona Shaw's traitorous ""Father"" is literally blind to everything. Patrick Macnee (the original John Steed) has an important cameo as an invisible man. He holds the key to the mystery but he cannot be seen.Director Jeremiah Chechik (BENNY AND JOON) has created a modern day fairy tale out of the old series while retaining the droll humor and the surreal touches (the brightly colored teddy bears are a good example). Much of the look of the film resembles the illustrations of modern day children's books especially THE POLAR EXPRESS. My only real complaint with the film is Eddie Izzard's use of the f-word. It is totally out of character with the rest of the film and was added solely to get a PG-13 rating. I was hoping the DVD would include the missing footage cut from the film before its release but no cigar. Sources close to the film say that it would clarify a number of points including the two Mrs Peels. Perhaps we will see it in a future reissue. So for the meantime put away your preconceived baggage and try and take the film on its own terms and you may be pleasantly surprised as I was. After all seeing is believing.

The people who developed the film were huge Avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie. When Warner's realized that they didn't have a big budget summer film for 1998,they rushed production on The Avengers, threw a lot of money at it, and more or less told the producers they wanted a big hit. Needless to say, pandering to the masses and doing good &quot;Avengers&quot; are incompatible, which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused (though I am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than I ended up) . Unfortunately, take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense. Apparently, the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money, which is exactly how much they made.Regarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch.

I don't know why I revisited ""The Avengers"" but I'm glad I did.  Common criticisms of the film at the time are these.  Fiennes as John Steed and Thurman as Emma Peel had no chemistry.  Connery as Sir August De Wynter was lackluster as the villain.  London, a bustling city, is oddly bereft of people.  Eddie Izzard as one of Connery's henchmen has no dialogue which is strange for a man who makes his living as a stand-up comic.  For the first two criticisms I'll say the critics are dead wrong.  For the second two I'll say that the makers of the film were making an ironic stab at comedy that may have gone over some people's heads.  Viewing this film unbiased by the criticisms at the time of it's release I'll say it's chief virtues are not only Fiennes, Thurman, and Connery but also terrific supporting work by Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, and Eileen Atkins. Patrick MacNee also has a decent cameo.  The film has decent production values and special effects but they're secondary to some cheeky dialogue notably between Fiennes and Thurman.  It's rare that I do a 180 on a film but that's the case here.  This film may have its detractors but if you go into it with an open mind you may find delight in ""The Avengers"".",5,Time Is The Great Avenger,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,1996,"['Nineties', 'was', 'fashionable', 'Hollywood', 'adapt', 'popular', 'television', 'series', 'big', 'screen', 'best', 'being', 'Fugitive', 'very', 'worst', 'mind', 'Lost', 'Space', 'were', 'high', 'hopes', 'riding', 'Avengers', 'Summer', '1998', 'dream', 'cast', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'iconic', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Things', 'did', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'film', 'when', 'film', 'release', 'date', 'kept', 'getting', 'pushed', 'back', 'Things', 'looked', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'previewed', 'critics', 'naturally', 'daggers', 'were', 'drawn', 'when', 'was', 'seen', 'public', 'followed', 'suit', 'saw', 'theatre', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'expectations', 'what', 'were', 'expectations', 'bad', 'film', ""n't"", 'film', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'revisited', 'Avengers', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Common', 'criticisms', 'film', 'time', 'are', 'Fiennes', 'John', 'Steed', 'Thurman', 'Emma', 'Peel', 'had', 'chemistry', 'Connery', 'Sir', 'August', 'De', 'Wynter', 'was', 'lackluster', 'villain', 'London', 'bustling', 'city', 'oddly', 'bereft', 'people', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'one', 'Connery', 'henchmen', 'dialogue', 'strange', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'first', 'two', 'criticisms', ""'ll"", 'say', 'critics', 'are', 'dead', 'wrong', 'second', 'two', ""'ll"", 'say', 'makers', 'film', 'were', 'making', 'ironic', 'stab', 'comedy', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'people', 'heads', 'Viewing', 'film', 'unbiased', 'criticisms', 'time', 'release', ""'ll"", 'say', 'chief', 'virtues', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'Fiennes', 'Thurman', 'Connery', 'also', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'work', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Patrick', 'MacNee', 'also', 'decent', 'cameo', 'film', 'decent', 'production', 'values', 'special', 'effects', ""'re"", 'secondary', 'cheeky', 'dialogue', 'notably', 'Fiennes', 'Thurman', 'rare', 'do', '180', 'film', 'case', 'here', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'detractors', 'go', 'open', 'mind', 'may', 'find', 'delight', 'Avengers']",N/A

This film bore little resemblance to that wonderful show. The original Avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful, almost comic book quality characters.  However, in this film, the plot meanders. Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch.

106755,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,0790738503,Duane Thomas,"[14, 19]","To understand why The Avengers movie so totally misses the mark, you have to understand why the original Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg British TV series worked so well. This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.When Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.To John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.The Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.So that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.The casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.There are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.",1,"Great TV Show, Lousy Movie",1090627200,"07 24, 2004",2004,4697,"['understand',

Jeremiah Chechik had offered to reedit the film which was cut from its original length of 115 minutes down to 87 minutes, which would be nice to see since I believe there is enough here to actually make a good film. Perhaps a director's cut will one day be released. In the mean time there are still bits and pieces here for one to enjoy.

And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.First off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way ""Toys"" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.Then there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named ""Evil Peel,"" and gets to say the line, ""You just saved me from myself."" Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the ""funnier"" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!It's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film.

Unfortunately, a lot of scenes which were in the trailer were deleted from the film after what are rumored to be terrible test screenings, and in the end, we wind up with what looks like an action movie trailer for the real thing (please excuse me for using Ridley Scott's descrption of his own film ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" when talking about the Director's Cut). The original length of the movie is rumored to run aywhere from 115 minutes to 2/1/2 hours. Frankly, I LOVED the movie, but am left feeling cheated because the Director's Cut has not been released. Warner Bros. should plan to release it, as there is a fan base, however small, for this movie. Also, there's a narrative error caused by the editing down to 86-89 minutes-SPOILER AHEAD!!!-when infiltrating Sir August De Wynter's lair, how did the real Doctor Peel know the code words (""How now, brown cow?"") to get into the lair with John Steed, as the line is not heard in the film prior to the scene?-SPOILER OVER!!! I enjoyed the acting of everyone involved, but felt that Sean Connery was underused (and, judging by the trailer and information on another site, most of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor). SPOILER ALERT!!! Patrick Macnee's cameo was good. I guess the reason he chose not to appear on screen (and why Ms. Rigg turned down a cameo in the film) is because they didn't want the cameos to distract the audience from the plot of the movie. It also would have been nice to see Honor Blackman, another Bond Girl, appear in the film as well. Trivia: Patrick Macnee also appeared in a Bond film: ""A View To A Kill."" PLEASE, somebody contact Warner Bros. & urge them to release the Director's Cut of this movie and the Director's Cut of""Anna Karenina"" starring Sophie Marceau, Sean Bean, James Fox, Phyllida Law and Alfred Molina.

Sean Connery stars as Sir August de Wynter, an evil scientist who plans to threaten the world with his hi-tech weather machine which produces such phenomena as tornadoes, hail storms, extreme temperatures, and mechanical insects for good measure.  He makes his intentions known to world leaders and tells them that they must ""purchase"" their weather from him at a very hefty price.Enter our two heroes, John Steed, played by Ralph Fiennes, and Mrs. Peel, played by Uma Thurman.  Steed is a Bond-like special agent working for a British counter-intelligence agency.  He and his partner Mrs. Peel have been assigned to destroy De Wynter.  Uma Thurman is excellent in her role.  From her high speed driving skills to her cat-like climbing reflexes, she's the perfect counterpart to Steed's intellect and no-nonsense approach.The special effects were the high point of the film, especially the spectacular weather effects.  The tornadoes and hail storms looked very realistic, and the final battle between Steed and De Wynter is astounding.  I enjoyed this movie for several reasons.

Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable.  Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch.  First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.  So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves.  Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel.  Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion.

I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......On the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.In its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.The basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.After the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.A perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.There's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.I read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.The acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.The film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.Special effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).I'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.(On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)The Avengers is rated PG-13 and contains violence and language.",1,Terrible in every way.,1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,7069,"['Being',

Beusch,"[6, 11]","I really, really, really hope that Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, Honor Blackman and Linda Thorson didn't see this abortive attempt to recreate the cult British series from the 1960's. Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen. For every adaptation like The Fugitive, there are dozens of bombs like My Favorite Martian, The Mod Squad and this dud.I am actually one of the few unlucky people to actually see this ""film"" in the theater. I fell asleep. So just to be fair and to have a complete impression of the film, I rented the DVD. I fell asleep twice more before I saw the entire film. It was so bad it made me wish I had fallen asleep a third time.What makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).The film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series.Do yourself a favor. Instead of buying this waste of precious natural resources, buy the DVD set of the Emma Peel episodes of the original series.

I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque?This movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes.This movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin.The saddest thing is it could have been good and I really did want to like this.",1,Sean Connery/Ralph Fiennes  Hang Your Heads In Shame,1005696000,"11 14, 2001",2001,2346,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'put', 'review', 'perspective', 'wanted', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'movie', 'think', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'fine', 'actor', 'more', ""'m"", 'Scottish', 'custom', ""'re"", 'Scottish', ""'m"", 'one', 'Sir', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'greatest', 'fans', 'was', 'best', 'Bond', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'doing', 'fine', 'job', 'great', 'movies', 'such', 'Hill', 'Untouchables', 'even', 'accent', 'was', 'bit', 'ropey', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Rock', 'Outland', 'etc', 'fine', 'ambassador', 'nation', 'world', 'greatest', 'living', 'Scotsman', 'popular', 'acclaim', 'BUT', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'Sir', 'Sean', 'when', 'made', 'pile', 'poo', 'Did', ""n't"", 'read', 'script', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'banking', 'cheque', 'movie', 'stinks', 'Not', 'remake', 'sixties', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'was', ""n't"", 'Not', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'potential', 'did', 'Not', 'series', 'had', 'cult', 'following', 'movie', 'had', 'ready', 'made', 'audience', 'tap', 'one', 'worst', 'scripts', 'ever', 'plot-holes', 'could', 'drive', 'car', 'poor', 'editing', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'choreographed', 'directed', 'action', 'scenes', 'could', 'ever', 'see', 'Take', 'bow', 'Mr', 'Jeremiah', 'Chechick', 'also', 'director', 'fine', 'Benny', 'Joon', 'awful', 'National', 'Lampoons', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'movie', 'also', 'fine', 'English', 'accent', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'truly', 'awful', 'acting', 'display', 'not', 'just', 'incredibly', 'wooden', 'uncharismatic', 'performance', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes.This', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'let', 'critics', 'see', 'prior', 'theatrical', 'release', 'word', 'mouth', 'soon', 'spread', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'stone', 'anyway', 'According', 'Total', 'Film', 'Magazine', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'was', 'hacked', 'down', 'mere', '89', 'minutes', 'theatrical', 'release', 'disastrous', 'test', 'screening', 'thus', 'making', 'Don', 'MacPherson', 'screenplay', 'supposedly', 'based', 'Shakespeares', 'Tempest', 'make', 'even', 'less', 'sense', 'Voted', 'second', 'worst', 'blockbuster', 'ever', 'made', 'readers', 'UK', 'Total', 'Film', 'magazine', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'anybody', 'career', 'particularly', 'harmed', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'previous', 'outing', 'had', 'been', 'sequally', 'awful', 'Batman', 'Robin.The', 'saddest', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'really', 'did', 'want', 'like']",N/A

Granted, the superfeminine Diana Rigg isn't playing Mrs. Peel...and yes, dapper, veddy British Patrick McNee isn't parlaying Steed, but they did pretty well with what they had, and had a plotline that you were actually able to FOLLOW, to boot! This is something I remember the TV show NOT having...most of the stories were just platforms for Emma to be stylish in, with no clues, no O. Henry, no real DISCERNIBLE plot thread to speak of...just the barest of storylines....The story involves Steed first MEETING Emma, (again!) and Emma being a major renaissance woman...doctor, meteorologist, psychologist, etc....the woman holds more degrees than a Kelvin thermometer!! The film opens up with Steed being tested for reflexes and skills as he strolls through a mockup of a British village. Pram-pushing nannies throw knives, pub drinkers try to run him over, bobbies attack him unbidden...he comes through with flying colors. Switch to Emma Peel's fabulous flat in London...she gets the call from the elite arm of the BSS that Steed works for after it's discovered that she, or a double of her, has sabotaged her own project.What follows are chase scenes from hell; some VERY mannered acting; Sean Connery chewing the scenery as a megalomaniac meteorologist and businessman who wants to, what else, RULE THE WORLD...by controlling the weather. Steed and Emma go after him when it's discovered, unequivocally, that it IS a double of Emma sabotaging her project...and in fact, attempting to kill the original Mrs. Peel!The cinematography and art direction for this film is EXCELLENT. The music, however, except for the lifts from the series, seems somewhat inappropriate and overly ponderous. There are some hair-raising chase scenes in the film, one with a fleet of mechanical, anti-personnel hornets, and Connery's acting is perfect for his role. The style of the series is recaptured nicely, especially with the villians' confab scene in teddy bear mufti in the middle of the film, and Emma wandering through what looks like M.C. Escher's summer home.All in all, the phlegmatic bearing of Fiennes and Thurman in the face of it all remind you an AWFUL lot of the original Steed and Emma, and the climax between Steed, Emma, Connery, Eddie Izzard, Fiona Shaw, as the very teutonic-looking ""Father"", (supposedly one of the GOOD guys,) and Connery's henchmen is fairly entertaining.While it may never win a spot on AFI's top 100, it IS diverting. My one complaint is...why did they have to pick UMA THURMAN...Ms. Box Office Poison herself, to play Emma? Was Nicole Kidman busy? Emma Thompson? Miranda Richardson? WHY A YANK??!!

Is this as fast as you can go?""I much preferred this movie to most of the James Bond movies. For one, the wit is wicked, Uma Thurman (Mrs. Peel) was born to wear a catsuit and Ralph Fiennes is a most dapper John Steed. This movie has style, yet the backdrop is a special effects surreal dream. If you love storms moving in on a beach, rainy days or just gothic style weather, this is for you.While drinking tea most often, these two secret agents fight crime in style while resisting the impulse to drown in more than a hands-off sexual chemistry. I could watch these two play mind games for hours. In one scene John Steed is discussing Dr. Emma Peel's profile and states:""After all, according to your file you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia, based on traumatic oppression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior.""Then, he states that she is just his style. Of course, she is not the type of woman he needs to save from herself or anyone else for that fact and more than likely he is describing the other Mrs. Peel who seems much more violent. This Mrs. Peel can take care of herself, thank you very much.So, what is the diabolic plan they must thwart?  Ah, yes....the evil aristocrat, Sir August DeWynter. He plans to threaten the world with his fantastic high-tech weather machine. He is capable of threatening mankind with raging ice storms, scorching temperatures and mechanical insects. The special effects in regards to the weather are seamless and spectacular.The script is delicious, the chemistry drips over the edge of the mind into a pool of absolute surging tension and visually, The Avengers is very compelling.

Plus, he looks absolutely smashing with that suit and bowler hat.Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg, but does make the role of Emma Peel her own in this film with beauty and grace.  And I thought the chemistry between her and Fiennes was excellent.I think Sean Connery relished playing an over-the-top diabolical mastermind in this film, and you can see that he was just having a ball.The special effects are awesome, and I think this film could very well be a cult classic, just as long as it isn't compared with the orignal series.

Terribly miscast as superspy John Steed--Fiennes is charmless in the role that Patrick  MacNee so ably brought to life on television--he resembles a child wearing his father's hat (and not too happy about it).  Uma Thurman fares little better.  While she was terrific in both ""Kill Bill"" films, she's way out of her league looks-wise and charisma-wise when compared to Diana Rigg's simply scrumptious Emma Peel.  And then there's the story, or what passes for it, something about a scene-chewing though not particularly convincing Sean Connery controlling the world's weather.  Director Jeremiah Chechik and whoever is willing to take the blame for the script get some of the surface details of ""The Avengers"" formula right but completely miss the boat with regard to the TV series' wit, style, and sophistication, another (typical) modern misstep of focusing on form and ignoring substance.  To be fair, a lot apparently was cut from the film before its release, but it's hard to imagine anything salvaging ""The Avengers""--and the DVD is sans deleted scenes, so the point is moot.

106808,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0790738503,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","In an age of director's cuts and extended additions, the irony is that the films that need restoration the most are the very ones that never get it. Thus the Weinsteins chose not to restore The Fall of the Roman Empire, MGM/UA chose not only to ignore the existing four-hour rough-cut version of Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade but actually put out a cut version of the theatrical version and the much-troubled 1998 movie version of The Avengers will never be seen as it was originally intended. It's not the catastrophe its often portrayed, but the studio only had themselves to blame for the over-reaction by violating the quid-pro-quo relationship with the press by not screening it for the critics, a public relations disaster that lead to many publications imposing a blacklist on articles about their films for months after and picking it as their turkey of the year.Warner Bros. 75th anniversary year was certainly not good one, with flop after flop turning their planned celebrations into commiserations. Perhaps in any other year there would have been less pressure on trying to turn an always optimistically surreal cult item into a blockbuster despite increasingly bad word of mouth, but by the time it emerged from lengthy post-production, the film was covered from head to toe in self-inflicted wounds. What had started out with a two-hour plus running time went to a 101-minute compromise cut to a released version that ran only 81 minutes without credits with Michael Kamen's original score replaced by a quickie effort from Joel McNeely as they tried to unsuccessfully make it more conventional to an audience unfamiliar with the series while alienating the original fans. It's just a surprise they didn't try to edit it down further to the length of a TV episode - even the troubled movie version of The Saint only lost its last 20 minutes. In the process they simply turned an interesting misfire into a much shorter, more confusing misfire and ended up with something too surreal for mainstream audiences, and too mainstream for Avengers fans. (The BFI was offered the chance to screen and preserve the original cut in 1999, but all too typically blew it by not bothering to return the studio's calls!)The loss of the original (and heavily trailered) opening was certainly a huge mistake. Instead of seeing Mrs Peel (or is it?) breaking into and destroying a weather station, something that triggers the plot (a variation on both the original show's A Surfeit of H20 and Our Man Flint with a weather-controlling eccentric millionaire holding the world to ransom), the film now opens with Steed taking on policemen, milkmen and machine-gun toting nannies with only his bowler and brolly - an enjoyable enough introductory scene but not as essential to understanding what's going on. That's just the first of many plot holes the film is left with, but they're still the least of the film's problems.On the plus side, Ralph Fiennes wisely doesn't attempt a Patrick McNee impersonation as Steed, opting for a more formal, slightly reserved approach that lacks Macnee's effortless bonhomie but works well enough on its own terms. Jim Broadbent makes a good `Mother' and Eileen Atkins (in a cameo originally intended for Diana Rigg) effortlessly steals her few scenes. But if they're all on good form, just about everyone else isn't. Indeed, there's miscasting on an epic scale here - Fiona Shaw overacting for England yet again as `Father,' Eddie Izzard exuding all the menace of a fluffy kitten and Uma Thurman delivering a turn bad enough to make you sorry they didn't cast Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs Peel instead. You feel almost sorry for her and wonder how she ever got another job after this - she can't do comedy, she can't do the accent, she can't do sophisticated, she can't do the banter and most of her action scenes hit the cutting room floor, which reduces her to not much more than a clotheshorse. That there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Fiennes is just another nail in the coffin.Sadly it's a performance more than matched by what originally seemed the film's great casting coup. Sean Connery, once again showing the keen commercial instinct that led him to turn down X-Men, Lord of the Rings and The Mask of Zorro, gives a career-worst performance in his first role as a villain since 1959's Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and 1984's Sword of the Valiant. Looking like Windsor Davies playing a dirty old man but without the restraint, his introductory single-entendre scene with Thurman is painful to watch as she flounders and he mistimes every line - it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Robbie Moffat film where amateur actors only get one take and it goes in the picture whether they fluff it or not. It cannot be stressed enough just how absolutely awful he is for much of the film, and considering how often Connery's double stood in for him Peter Sellers-style even on non-action scenes because of the star's feuds with the director and producer (shades of LXG) you find yourself wondering if his better moments may not even be him.There's a lot about it that's good - the teddy bear scene is spot on and worthy of the original show while Patrick McNee's cameo non-appearance is fun - and a lot that isn't - Roger Pratt's dour photography overcompensates for the primary colors of Stuart Craig's production design and Anthony Powell's costumes. Yet while it's a mess that often stops making sense thanks to the unsubtle re-editing, it's still surprisingly watchable, with just enough moments that do work and give a hint of what could have been to keep you soldiering on through the patches that fall flat. It's just a shame we'll probably never see the film the way it was originally intended to judge it on its own merits rather than the studio's second-guessing.Not much in the way of extras here - just  a  trailer  and som e  text notes - though the disc does have an acceptable widescreen transfer.",3,Not a catastrophe but certainly a mess,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,5970,"['age', 'director',

The opening 45 minutes is  smashing-which is perhaps why the ending is so frustrating.The main  reason for this let-down is not the ridiculousness of the plot. MISSION  IMPOSSIBLE, most Bond films, and even JURASSIC PARK have all had commercial  success with plots that weren't much better than this.  Rather, the failure  of this film comes in my mind from Sean Connery.  If this were the only  example of his acting one had ever seen, one would have difficulty seeing  how the man ever won an Oscar (R).  His performance is truly abysmal.  Yes,  the situations he's placed in and the lines themselves have a certain  hollowness to them, but all meglomaniacs in all action films are, well,  silly.  Though I do think one or two scenes exploring a bit more of de  Wynter's character might've been in order, films have been more satisfying  with less-scripted villains.  The glaring difficulty is that Connery  obviously doesn't *believe* in his character.  It's absolutely obvious that  he's not having fun-even with the good lines.  As a result, we don't  either.By contrast, Fiennes and Thurman are having the time of their  lives, playing roles that seem to have been tailor-made for them, despite  having originated with other actors.  There are really no scenes which  their presence doesn't immediately help, and one can't help but feel that  if the movie had simply had a different actor cast as the villain, their  chemistry would've gone better appreciated by the viewing public.(DVD  notes: There are really no additional features on the DVD, which is  surprising.  The production team were all huge fans of the TV show and  spent years trying to bring this puppy to screen.  One would've thought  they'd have been absolutely passionate about trying to explain what had  been a big part of their lives for years.)",3,Connery's de Wynter freezes finale,961286400,"06 18, 2000",2000,2003,"['ultimate', 'disappointment', 'AVENGERS', 'fans', 'especially', 'viewers', 'being', 'first', 'introduced', 'AVENGERS', 'mythos', 'film', 'least', 'while', 'show', 'bad', 'side', 'opening', '45', 'minutes', 'smashing-which', 'perhaps', 'why', 'ending', 'so', 'frustrating.The', 'main', 'reason', 'let-down', 'not', 'ridiculousness', 'plot', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'most', 'Bond', 'films', 'even', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'have', 'had', 'commercial', 'success', 'plots', 'were', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'failure', 'film', 'mind', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'were', 'only', 'example', 'acting', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'difficulty', 'seeing', 'how', 'man', 'ever', 'won', 'Oscar', 'R', 'performance', 'truly', 'abysmal', 'Yes', 'situations', 'placed', 'lines', 'have', 'certain', 'hollowness', 'meglomaniacs', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'well', 'silly', 'do', 'think', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'exploring', 'bit', 'more', 'de', 'Wynter', 'character', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'order', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'satisfying', 'less-scripted', 'villains', 'glaring', 'difficulty', 'Connery', 'obviously', ""n't"", '*believe*', 'character', 'absolutely', 'obvious', 'not', 'having', 'fun-even', 'good', 'lines', 'result', 'do', ""n't"", 'either.By', 'contrast', 'Fiennes', 'Thurman', 'are', 'having', 'time', 'lives', 'playing', 'roles', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'tailor-made', 'having', 'originated', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'scenes', 'presence', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'help', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'movie', 'had', 'simply', 'had', 'different', 'actor', 'cast', 'villain', 'chemistry', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'better', 'appreciated', 'viewing', 'public', 'DVD', 'notes', 'are', 'really', 'additional', 'features', 'DVD', 'surprising', 'production', 'team', 'were', 'huge', 'fans', 'TV', 'show', 'spent', 'years', 'trying', 'bring', 'puppy', 'screen', 'One', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'absolutely', 'passionate', 'trying', 'explain', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'big', 'part', 'lives', 'years']",N/A

And although it ain't the &quot;real thing,&quot; it deserves kudos for being a noble, and even entertaining, effort.",3,Faithful in spirit,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,527,"['Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay', 'back', '1966', 'was', '6th', 'grade', 'discovered', 'Steed', 'Emma', 'TV', 'adored', 'So', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'never', 'expected', 'quot', 'live', 'quot', 'originals', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'faithful', 'was', 'tone', 'wackiness', 'old', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'minority', 'thinking', 'believe', 'quot', 'Avengers', 'quot', 'was', 'brought', 'lovingly', 'screen', 'ai', ""n't"", 'quot', 'real', 'thing', 'quot', 'kudos', 'being', 'noble', 'even', 'entertaining', 'effort']",N/A

It was cheeky, weird and campy. All these elements make the transition to the big screen version. What's missing is the soul of the  television series.I'm not sure, though, that the original would play  well today without some updating. Like many things from the 60's, it was  something very much of its time. Look at the Connery Bond films...they  wouldn't be as accepted today as they were then.The time frame within  gives us a context. Without the context, the material doesn't always work.  The original series for all of the well written episodes had episodes that  were poorly plotted messes. Like the Star Trek series of films, the past  seems to add an luster to these dramas that they don't always  deserve.Still, the original series was always a cut above the average  American television programs. It was always witty and the cast, more often  than not, could pull off the show precisely because of their charm. This  along with the bizarre elements that would crop up in the scripts made The  Avengers always good fun. The film doesn't completely pull it off, but  there are moments that work as well as the original series.Fiennes  brings his own intrepetation to Steed. To have expected him to play it like  MacNee is pretty unrealistic and it probably wouldn't have worked. The same  goes for Thurman. However, for me she's the weak link in the  cast.Connery plays his part over the top. It works precisely because it  worked in the original series. Expectations can be daunting and this film  had too many expectations.

The Avengers must find him and stop him. Even the great Connery couldn't save this dog from the DVD discount bins in Walmart, although his performance brings the only class to this sham.Ralph Fiennes is an outstanding actor in many other things. In this one he just missed that brilliant sparkle that the British own, and he doesn't get it. While he was brilliant in movies such as Schindler's List, this is another one of his hit and misses. I'm not very familiar with Uma Thurman, I know a lot of people drool over her, and it's obvious why. However, she also didn't have that chic magic that the original Mrs. Peel possessed.The plot and scenery remind me of a well-made computer animation game--today's audience accepts this sort of 'near realism' but I could do without it, I would have enjoyed more thought provoking plot lines.I wouldn't own this one but it's worth a watch on one of the premium movie channels if you're bored.

Now I do admit that I am to young to understand the better parts of the show, I'm 24. Yet in terms to the movie it was not to bad. The acting could have been better, yet the costums were cool and had that over the top feel that the orginal show had.Although the toung and cheek humor was a bit lame in the movie and could have been developed a bit more. Uma Thurman did do an okay job playing Mrs. Peel, yet more could have been said about her and personality because she does differ from the TV show. It would have been better of the movie to keep her with the same persona as the orginal Mrs. Peel then add to it to make it more 90's. The same for Ralph Fiennes. He does seem to lose his temper more in the move in contrast to the show. There are plot holes but what movie doesn't have at least one. Most people are right in that some things needed to be explaned better. The editing is really bad in the move.The Art Department did an amazing job for the look and feel of the move. The same with the FX too simple great. Also with the Visual Effects were stunning.The cinematograph is another thing that saves this film from being a total bomb.This move seems to wanna reach the post 60's crowd and apeal more to the teens of the 90's. with that in mind this really is not a really bad movie. For the die hard 60's kids this will be painful, but the new generation this is a pretty good flick.
