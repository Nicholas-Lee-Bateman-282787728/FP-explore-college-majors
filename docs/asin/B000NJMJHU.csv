He is called upon to consult on an unusual case involving a man covered in a strange orange powder. Briggs is accidentally contaminated by this substance (which he later finds out is only used in ancient tribal rituals). This results in what appear to be blackouts and hallucinations. As the days pass, Briggs realizes that these experiences are actually 30 year old memories from someone else's life! Not just any memories, but those of a serial killer! Briggs becomes obsessed w/ finding out the truth behind these visions. MEMORY is a fast-moving tale of mystery and suspense w/ mystical overtones.

The plot handles these themes of memory and its relationship to real life with no more than average effectiveness with a fair degree of incoherence reducing the impact of the relevant scenes.

The acting and execution is pretty good - I was drawn by the Billy Zane and Dennis Hopper combination - but it's just too messy to function properly.  At times a psychological thriller with anthropology roots, at others a family drama with hints at cyber predators, the best I can say is that it's mostly science fiction.Dr. Taylor Briggs (Billy Zane) is a neurologist who has devoted his professional life to curing the disease (Alzheimer's) affecting his mother.  While at a conference abroad in the Amazon, he is consulted on a bizarre local case of a man, ostensibly American, who is covered in red dye and in possession of an unusual MRI.  The MRI shows tumors that have specifically targeted the memory centers of the brain.  When Dr. Briggs accidentally becomes exposed to the mystery patient, he begins having recurring black-outs and dreams that cause concern.  Together with a retired doctor (Hopper - who is criminally underused) and a few assorted but relatively unimportant friends, Briggs discovers the cause for his hallucinations and dark dreams may tie together his broken past and the sickening exploits of a serial killer.Essentially this movie reminded me of a pedophile's version of [Kiss the Girls]], but with the ""inside the killer"" genre.

It's surprisingly good, although I'm still not sure I understand the plot in it's entirety.For instance: why would exposure to some guy's shamanic memory serum all the sudden turn Billy Zane on a specifically personal quest to find out who his real father was?  Does the memory serum itself have some kind of good willed soul that steers him in this direction?  Why wouldn't it just make him nuts with all sorts of memories at once until it got out of his system?I really wished Dennis Hopper had turned out to be the maniac; after all, he seems like one anyway, even as the benevolent scientist ""would be"" father of Zane's character.  The hallucinations in this film range from hokey to very, very effective; Ann Margret gives a chillingly effective performance as the torchbearer of a very perverse evil.  At times this reminded me of Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" and at other times like the crazier parts of ""Rambo 3"": it's almost as though Roger Corman and Luis Bunuel decided to take the reigns together in an unlikely collaboration.Nonetheless, the plot keeps you guessing and the ending is actually pretty shocking.",5,Strangely entertaining,1198454400,"12 24, 2007",2007,1286,"['When', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'good', 'previews', 'were', 'grade', 'B', 'trash', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'anticipating', 'opening', 'credits', 'surprisingly', 'good', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'understand', 'plot', 'entirety.For', 'instance', 'why', 'would', 'exposure', 'guy', 'shamanic', 'memory', 'serum', 'sudden', 'turn', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'specifically', 'personal', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'real', 'father', 'was', 'memory', 'serum', 'have', 'kind', 'good', 'willed', 'soul', 'direction', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'nuts', 'sorts', 'memories', 'once', 'got', 'system', 'really', 'wished', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'maniac', 'one', 'anyway', 'even', 'benevolent', 'scientist', 'would', 'be', 'father', 'Zane', 'character', 'hallucinations', 'film', 'range', 'hokey', 'very', 'very', 'effective', 'Ann', 'Margret', 'chillingly', 'effective', 'performance', 'torchbearer', 'very', 'perverse', 'evil', 'times', 'reminded', 'Hitchcock', 'Spellbound', 'other', 'times', 'crazier', 'parts', 'Rambo', '3', 'almost', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'decided', 'take', 'reigns', 'together', 'unlikely', 'collaboration.Nonetheless', 'plot', 'guessing', 'ending', 'actually', 'pretty', 'shocking']",Memory
1057407,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000NJMJHU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 10]","""Memory"" starts off by providing the correct pronunciation of the word and what appeared to be the complete dictionary definition of the term.  For some reason this made me think of ""Memento,"" which was a mistake because this horror thriller is nothing like that ambitious film.  Billy Zane stars as Dr. Taylor Briggs, who was exposed to some strange stuff in Brazil that is causing him to have flashbacks.  What is odd is that these appear to be somebody else's flashbacks, and to make things even more interesting the memories seem to be those of a serial killer who targets young women.  Given how old the memories appear to be the only cast member running around who would seem to fit the bill is Max Lichtenstein, who is played by Dennis Hopper, which moves the serial killer possibility into the realm of the so patently obvious that you have to discount it (the music cues only reinforce such suspicions since the movie is trying so hard to nudge us in his direction).  But Briggs has family issues, so we pay attention because such exposition is also the key to unraveling the mystery, such as it is.Beyond the ""who"" the more interesting question is the ""how,"" because picking up on somebody else's memories is not something that happens every day.  The need to solve such mysteries never really gets beyond the ""because they are there"" stage, and for my money ""Memory"" is harmed by attempting to explain the science behind what is happening.  When somebody such as myself, who never even got as far as taking high biology, rolls their eyes and laughs out loud at the idea that memories can be contained in DNA, then it must really be bad.  It occurs to me that this sort of scientific mumbo-jumbo could have worked decades ago on something like ""The Twilight Zone,"" but then Rod Serling, Richard Matheson, and the rest of the ""Zone"" writers were all about the payoff, and that is where ""Memory"" suddenly looks like somebody slipped in the last real from another horror film.  I swear, if you fell asleep for five minutes and woke up during the final scenes you would think that you had slept through the end of one movie and were watching the conclusion of the second on a Billy Zane-double feature.  I would accuse this film of  engaging in bait and switch except there is no reason to assume those responsible for this film were thinking that far ahead.""Memory"" is directed by Bennett Davlin, who co-wrote the script along with Anthony Badalucco and Russ Turley, which might explain why the ending seems so unlike the rest of the movie.  The other major characters in the story are Tricia Helfer of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fame as Stephanie Jacobs, an artist who becomes Briggs' romantic interest in the film (yes, she does a nude scene, but, no, there is nothing to see, so do not rent ""Memory"" in that hope) and Ann-Margaret as Carol Hargrave, the owner of a Gallery who sets up the introduction of the scientist and the artist.  I was wondering why Ann-Margaret bothered to make this movie, because in 2006 she was having something of a mini-comback what with making ""The Break-Up"" and ""The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause.""  Therefore it would hardly seem necessary for her to make a movie like this one unless she gets to do something a bit different, which she does, so that may have been part of the rationale.  But then I discovered this film was really made in 2005 and sat on the shelf for a while, which strikes me as bizaare given all the crap that goes direct to video.  This film might fail more than it succeeds, but it does feature a pretty good cast for this type of movie.",3,Fans of horror thrillers do not need to remember to see this film,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,3603,"['Memory', 'providing', 'correct', 'pronunciation', 'word', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'complete', 'dictionary', 'definition', 'term', 'reason', 'made', 'think', 'Memento', 'was', 'mistake', 'horror', 'thriller', 'nothing', 'ambitious', 'film', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'stars', 'Dr.', 'Taylor', 'Briggs', 'who', 'was', 'exposed', 'strange', 'stuff', 'Brazil', 'causing', 'have', 'flashbacks', 'What', 'odd', 'appear', 'be', 'somebody', 'else', 'flashbacks', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'memories', 'seem', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'young', 'women', 'Given', 'how', 'old', 'memories', 'appear', 'be', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'running', 'who', 'would', 'seem', 'fit', 'bill', 'Max', 'Lichtenstein', 'who', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'serial', 'killer', 'possibility', 'realm', 'so', 'patently', 'obvious', 'have', 'discount', 'music', 'only', 'reinforce', 'such', 'suspicions', 'movie', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'nudge', 'direction', 'Briggs', 'family', 'issues', 'pay', 'attention', 'such', 'exposition', 'also', 'key', 'unraveling', 'mystery', 'such', 'who', 'more', 'interesting', 'question', 'how', 'picking', 'up', 'somebody', 'else', 'memories', 'not', 'something', 'day', 'need', 'solve', 'such', 'mysteries', 'never', 'really', 'are', 'there', 'stage', 'money', 'Memory', 'harmed', 'attempting', 'explain', 'science', 'what', 'happening', 'When', 'somebody', 'such', 'who', 'never', 'even', 'got', 'as', 'far', 'taking', 'high', 'biology', 'eyes', 'out', 'loud', 'idea', 'memories', 'can', 'be', 'contained', 'DNA', 'then', 'must', 'really', 'be', 'bad', 'sort', 'scientific', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'decades', 'something', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'then', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'rest', 'Zone', 'writers', 'were', 'payoff', 'where', 'Memory', 'suddenly', 'somebody', 'slipped', 'last', 'real', 'horror', 'film', 'swear', 'fell', 'asleep', 'five', 'minutes', 'woke', 'up', 'final', 'scenes', 'would', 'think', 'had', 'slept', 'end', 'one', 'movie', 'were', 'watching', 'conclusion', 'second', 'Billy', 'Zane-double', 'feature', 'would', 'accuse', 'film', 'engaging', 'bait', 'switch', 'reason', 'assume', 'responsible', 'film', 'were', 'thinking', 'far', 'ahead', 'Memory', 'directed', 'Bennett', 'Davlin', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Anthony', 'Badalucco', 'Russ', 'Turley', 'might', 'explain', 'why', 'ending', 'so', 'rest', 'movie', 'other', 'major', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'Tricia', 'Helfer', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'fame', 'Stephanie', 'Jacobs', 'artist', 'who', 'Briggs', 'romantic', 'interest', 'film', 'yes', 'nude', 'scene', 'nothing', 'see', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'rent', 'Memory', 'hope', 'Ann-Margaret', 'Carol', 'Hargrave', 'owner', 'Gallery', 'who', 'up', 'introduction', 'scientist', 'artist', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'Ann-Margaret', 'bothered', 'make', 'movie', '2006', 'was', 'having', 'something', 'mini-comback', 'what', 'making', 'Break-Up', 'Santa', 'Clause', '3', 'Escape', 'Clause', 'would', 'hardly', 'seem', 'necessary', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'do', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'rationale', 'then', 'discovered', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'made', '2005', 'sat', 'shelf', 'while', 'bizaare', 'given', 'crap', 'direct', 'video', 'film', 'might', 'fail', 'more', 'feature', 'pretty', 'good', 'cast', 'type', 'movie']",Memory

How a small production company gets a cast like this is beyond me, but this was just a great movie! Billy Zane is a guy with a clouded past, who decides to use an experimental drug to restore his memory. Only to vividly remember a murder he witnessed, but was it his memory or someone else's? I don't like Zane one bit, but in this movie, he's pure genius. What was really striking about this film, (especially since it's a low budget b-movie), was the imagery. Everything is so vibrate and methodically done. First time director, Bennett Davlin, really has you sitting on the edge of your seat. It really feels like you're alongside Zane, seeing what he sees. As for the ending, I never saw it coming. I've seen a lot of films, and you've got to have a pretty good story to surprise me!
