Gary Oldman is the bomb. But more importantly, he takes chances and that's exactly what he did with this film.THE BACKWOODS takes place in Northern Spain in 1978. Two couples are vacationing together, each in different stages of their marriage. The realism between Norman and Lucy is raw, there are moments I wanted to look away, the intimacy, the pain felt so real. The characters are fleshed out excellently before the ""real"" pain begins.Norman and Paul go on a misguided hunting trip in the woods and stumble on a seemingly abandoned house with a horrible secret. Locked away inside is a feral child chained and in rags. The child has deformities and has suffered tremendously, judging by her reaction to the men.Rather than leave her there to possible starve, since there wasn't any food in the shack, Paul decides to take her back with them. He reasons with Norman that they can feed her, clean her up and then take her to the police.And perhaps Paul's plan would have worked, except for the group of violent Spanish heathens who show up on his doorstep, determined to take back possession of their property. When the inevitable clash occurs, ill-fated choices are made, sad attempts at redemption and the grudging respect between two enemies.But even more surprising is the character development of Norman, the layers that strip away till the naked core is bloody and bruised.THE BACKWOODS won't be everyone's cup of tea. Everything isn't nice and neatly wrapped up at the end. I have to admit, the ending was a bit shocking for me, something I didn't see coming. But the film delivers. The atmosphere, the moodiness, the beautiful scenery, meaty characters that you can relate to, all this makes THE BACKWOODS a superior film experience.If you're wanting to veg out,rest your brain and not think, then this isn't your film. However if you want something to haunt your dreams and quite possibly your waking hours as well, THE BACKWOODS is the one.

The family and the villager don''t kill her for her abnormality but they don't let her interact with the rest of them possibly from superstition/ignorance - that is never made clear.  Basque is obviously given no preferential government support to develop unlike Tibet.  It is perhaps similar to the Australian Outback.According to Wikipedia, the Basque people have distinct dna.  This is also the case with the Tibetans.""In 1920, H. G. Wells referred to the Mediterranean race as the Iberian race. He regarded it as a fourth subrace of the Caucasian race, along with the Aryan, Semitic, and Hamitic subraces. He stated that the main ethnic group that most purely represented the racial stock of the Iberian race was the Basques, and that the Basques were the descendants of the Cro-Magnons. In 1994, in his book The History and Geography of Human Genes, population geneticist L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza stated that ""there is support from many sides"" for the hypothesis that the Basques are the descendants of the original Cro-Magnons.""This is a French Spanish coproduction which is appropriate because France and Spain both occupy native Basque territory where the inhabitants still speak their language and identify themselves as Basque.  Some of this story may be referring to the assimilation policy of aborginal children inRabbit-Proof Fencebut masked as a horror film.  All four of the stars are obviously non-native although Gary Oldman's character claims parial Basque ancestry like haoles who are part Hawaian or Johnny Depp who is given to reminding everyone of his Native American ancestry but in this film, the locals are having none of that.I think by making this one of many in a wave of horror films, there is more of an audience for this film which basically just puts our eyeballs on the Basque region and doesn't really do much else.

1140377,A3RBNLTA0UUFEZ,B00136MBUM,"Nolene-Patricia Dougan ""Dougs""","[13, 17]","While holidaying in the Basque region of Spain, two couples discover a child whose hands are severely misshapen.  The child has been gravely mistreated, and, as a result, cannot communicate. The two couples reluctantly decide to rescue her and report her circumstances to the authorities. However, severe weather and the denseness of the forest surrounding their holiday home make it impossible for them to make a quick getaway. Soon, the local inhabitants become aware that the girl is missing, and they rightly suspect the holiday-makers of taking her. Suspicions and paranoia begin to fester, and it isn't long before violence erupts. The villagers demand the little girl's return, and her rescuers refuse to give her up. A deadly game of cat-and-mouse ensues, making a return to normalcy impossible for everyone involved.The premise for The Backwoods is an intriguing one. The idea of how quickly basic human instincts make situations spiral out of control, is nearly always used to good effect in movies. For any writer/director, this concept opens up a myriad of opportunities to shock, as well as to fascinate. This fact probably accounts for why this device is a much-overused set piece. Films of this genre, when well executed, are guaranteed, at the very least, cult-classic status (e.g., Deliverance and Straw Dogs). However, when poorly executed, the resultant films can resemble a confusing, farcical mess. Unfortunately, The Backwoods is an example of the latter.The Backwoods starts off well, trying to develop the main characters, before violence eventually erupts. However, what we have learned of their character in the initial scenes gives us little insight as to why the characters react as they do to the situation they are dealt. For example, Oldman's character, Paul, is the only one of the four main characters who is thoroughly determined to save the girl. At no time does he falter, even when he could save his life by telling the villagers where the disfigured girl is. This character trait does not hold true, because, up to this point, his character has appeared arrogant and overbearing, with little or no regard for those around him. Having said this, the four leads all give solid, believable performances, and, for the most part, cover up, rather than expose, the inconsistencies in their characters' nature.Apart from flaws in the development of central characters, this movie has other problems. First, the deformity that the little girl has seems too ludicrous to be believable. If you have ever seen Batman Returns, and you remember the misshapen hands that The Penguin had, you will get the idea. As a viewer, the fact that the little girl has ""Penguin hands"" makes it hard to take her plight seriously.  And finally, the main reason why this movie is farcical rather than stimulating is the movie styles to which it chooses to pay homage. I can understand the stylish, 1970s-vibe it tries to recreate, and I can also appreciate the nods directed toward Peckinpah and Boorman. But, what I can't understand is why the writer and director chose to insert a Sergio Leone-style climactic scene. Up until the final scene, the movie has tried to be dark and thought-provoking. Up until the final moments it has tried to teach the audience something about the human psyche; it has failed miserably, but it has tried. And then, all of the sudden, ten minutes before the end, you have a man-on-man gunfight, reminiscent of a spaghetti western. This ultimate fight appears to be forced and is very much out of place. The only thing that links this final scene to what has preceded it, is the fact that the ultimate scene's outcome is as confusing and pointless as the rest of the movie.In short, The Backwoods is a jumbled mess, which is full of inconsistencies in character, plot, and style. The only factor that rescues The Backwoods from being a complete disaster are the proficient performances of its lead actors. If you want to watch a film that explores basic human instincts, why not try Magnolia Pictures', The Signal. You will find that film a lot more entertaining and a lot less confusing than this shambolic piece of filmmaking.",2,"Unfortunately, a bit of a confusing mess.",1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,4169,"['holidaying', 'Basque', 'region', 'Spain', 'two', 'couples', 'child', 'hands', 'are', 'severely', 'misshapen', 'child', 'been', 'gravely', 'mistreated', 'result', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'two', 'couples', 'reluctantly', 'decide', 'rescue', 'report', 'circumstances', 'authorities', 'However', 'severe', 'weather', 'denseness', 'forest', 'surrounding', 'holiday', 'home', 'make', 'impossible', 'make', 'quick', 'getaway', 'Soon', 'local', 'inhabitants', 'become', 'aware', 'girl', 'missing', 'rightly', 'suspect', 'holiday-makers', 'taking', 'Suspicions', 'paranoia', 'begin', 'fester', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'violence', 'erupts', 'villagers', 'demand', 'little', 'girl', 'return', 'rescuers', 'refuse', 'give', 'up', 'deadly', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'ensues', 'making', 'return', 'normalcy', 'impossible', 'everyone', 'involved.The', 'premise', 'Backwoods', 'intriguing', 'one', 'idea', 'how', 'quickly', 'basic', 'human', 'instincts', 'make', 'situations', 'spiral', 'control', 'nearly', 'always', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'movies', 'writer/director', 'concept', 'up', 'myriad', 'opportunities', 'shock', 'as', 'well', 'fascinate', 'fact', 'probably', 'accounts', 'why', 'device', 'much-overused', 'set', 'piece', 'Films', 'genre', 'when', 'well', 'executed', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'very', 'least', 'cult-classic', 'status', 'e.g.', 'Deliverance', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'However', 'when', 'poorly', 'executed', 'resultant', 'films', 'can', 'resemble', 'confusing', 'farcical', 'mess', 'Unfortunately', 'Backwoods', 'example', 'latter.The', 'Backwoods', 'off', 'well', 'trying', 'develop', 'main', 'characters', 'violence', 'eventually', 'However', 'what', 'have', 'learned', 'character', 'initial', 'scenes', 'little', 'insight', 'why', 'characters', 'react', 'do', 'situation', 'are', 'dealt', 'example', 'Oldman', 'character', 'Paul', 'only', 'one', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'determined', 'save', 'girl', 'time', 'falter', 'even', 'when', 'could', 'save', 'life', 'telling', 'villagers', 'where', 'disfigured', 'girl', 'character', 'trait', 'not', 'hold', 'true', 'up', 'point', 'character', 'appeared', 'arrogant', 'overbearing', 'little', 'regard', 'Having', 'said', 'four', 'give', 'solid', 'believable', 'performances', 'most', 'part', 'cover', 'up', 'rather', 'expose', 'inconsistencies', 'characters', 'nature.Apart', 'flaws', 'development', 'central', 'characters', 'movie', 'other', 'problems', 'First', 'deformity', 'little', 'girl', 'too', 'ludicrous', 'be', 'believable', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'remember', 'misshapen', 'hands', 'Penguin', 'had', 'will', 'get', 'idea', 'viewer', 'fact', 'little', 'girl', 'Penguin', 'hands', 'hard', 'take', 'plight', 'seriously', 'finally', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'farcical', 'rather', 'stimulating', 'movie', 'styles', 'pay', 'homage', 'can', 'understand', 'stylish', '1970s-vibe', 'recreate', 'can', 'also', 'appreciate', 'nods', 'directed', 'Peckinpah', 'Boorman', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'writer', 'director', 'chose', 'insert', 'Sergio', 'Leone-style', 'climactic', 'scene', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'tried', 'be', 'dark', 'thought-provoking', 'final', 'moments', 'tried', 'teach', 'audience', 'something', 'human', 'psyche', 'failed', 'miserably', 'tried', 'then', 'sudden', 'ten', 'minutes', 'end', 'have', 'man-on-man', 'gunfight', 'reminiscent', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'ultimate', 'fight', 'be', 'forced', 'very', 'much', 'place', 'only', 'thing', 'final', 'scene', 'what', 'preceded', 'fact', 'ultimate', 'scene', 'outcome', 'confusing', 'pointless', 'rest', 'movie.In', 'short', 'Backwoods', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'full', 'inconsistencies', 'character', 'plot', 'style', 'only', 'factor', 'Backwoods', 'being', 'complete', 'disaster', 'are', 'proficient', 'performances', 'lead', 'actors', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'basic', 'human', 'instincts', 'why', 'not', 'try', 'Magnolia', 'Pictures', 'Signal', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining', 'lot', 'less', 'confusing', 'shambolic', 'piece', 'filmmaking']",The Backwoods

1140379,A3V79KXIY09MOE,B00136MBUM,"Stacy ""Amazon Junkie""","[1, 1]","I have to give it to the director and all of the staff that filmed The Backwoods; the film truly does have a feel of late-70s nostalgia. That being the case, while the setting feels genuine, the plot tends to meander and never really picks up much of a pace. The story is simple: two couples are going on a vacation to an old farmhouse in the Basque Mountains of Spain. They are British; the couple who own the farmhouse speak fluent Spanish, the other two do not. On their way to the getaway they stop at the ""last sign of civilization"" and grab a quick drink. Some Spaniards drinking at a table say some rude things about English tourists only knowing enough Spanish to get drunk, the fluent gentleman admonishes them, the wife of the first guy walks into the doorway of the pub with a wet shirt on and showing it off to the patrons, and off they go.After this setup, you are waiting for the suspense to start. Couple #1 (who don't speak Spanish) are going through a difficult period on their marriage, with the wife being cold and almost rude to her husband, who lacks a spine. Couple #2 are much more worldly, the husband owns the farmhouse, is more of an outdoorsman, and is the de facto ""leader"" of the group. Everyone looks up to him for guidance, especially the husband from couple #1. With this setup, the two men go hunting and find a ""deformed"" girl locked up in a squalid cabin alone, filthy, feral, and with only a doll to keep her company.Now, the plot summary already tells you that they attempt to rescue the girl and it irritates some of the villagers. At this point you would think that the action picks up a bit, maybe you would see some stalking or other aspects to raise the tension. Nope. Eventually those same guys from the bar in the first scene show up at the cabin, looking for the girl. Now, you're thinking, FINALLY! some action! Nope, not really. Granted, the actions taken in this film exhibit a more ""normalized"" response to a threat than a slasher movie, and yes, there is death, but the way that everything plays out is so expected and clich&eacute; that I kept watching the movie just to see if my predictions were right.In short, the story has the main plot: the mystery of a deformed girl being locked up in a squalid cabin: why, how, who. Then there are subplots: the marital issues of Couple #1, the indecisiveness of husband #1, the cold and rude way that wife #1 deals with him; all of these are introduced as the story drags along. The biggest problem is that you lack so much information about who is the bad guy/motive that a lot of what happens just seems random, with the differing plots and subtexts working their way into each scene without resolving anything. By the time the ending comes along, you really don't care anymore.I am sure that this movie is meant to demonstrate the outdated and cruel thinking that happens in the more rural areas of Europe, something akin to the backwoods ""antics"" displayed in movies like ""Deliverance"". But, taken as a suspense title meant to shame the ""wrong"" thinking and dangers of discriminating against those born differently. Between the wandering dialogue and plot that never makes a stronger statement than ""hmm maybe that's bad and you shouldn't do that"", you will need a horror/suspense infusion, STAT! My antidote?

1140380,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00136MBUM,trebe,"[2, 3]","With some solid acting performances, The Backwoods (2007) is a tense and edgy thriller with some dark undercurrents swirling beneath the surface, as newcomers to the Basque region in Spain, run afoul of some the locals.The year is 1978, and Paul (Gary Oldham) has invited his friend Norman (Paddy Considine) and his wife Lucy (Virginie Ledoyen), who are having marital problems, to come to his home located deep in the woods for a visit.  Paul's family was originally from the area, and he has moved there to live with his wife Isabel (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who is Spanish.  Paul himself speaks fluent Spanish, and tries to be a hospitable host, though he often comes off as a condescending know-it-all, talking down to Norman.While wandering through the woods hunting, Norman and Paul run across a cottage, break in, and discover a young girl with deformed hands, imprisoned inside.  Returning home with the girl, Paul decides to take her to the nearest village, and turn her over to the police.  While on the way, a distracted Paul slams his SUV into a tree, forcing the group to return to the cabin.The following day, a group of men with guns arrive at the house.  Their leader Paco (Lluis Homar), says they are looking for a missing girl.  Paul joins the search party intending to lead them away, and tells Norman to take the girl to the police.  Norman however, decides to stay put, lying to the women about what Paul told him to do.  This is a decisive point, as from here Norman takes charge of the women and little girl, while Paul matches wits with Paco, who knows more about the situation than it seems.  Violence soon erupts, as Paul brutally drowns a man, while Norman employs his shotgun, and heads into the woods with the women in an attempt to reach help.The film's ending is somewhat confusing and perhaps unsatisfying, as the child is saved, but things do not conclude in a neat and tidy manner, and there are jagged holes left for the viewer to fill in.  The situation between Lucy and Norman deteriorates under stress, and becomes one of the key elements.  It's a point of discussion, whether they have any future together.  Directed by Koldo Serra, Backwoods has some impressive cinematography, and some strong acting performances, particularly by Gary Oldman, Lluis Homar, and Paddy Considine.  The story while fairly credible, does unravel at the end, and the unconventional finish may be unsettling.  The action sequences are mostly very well done, and except for the terribly clich&eacute;d standoff at the end, pretty realistic.

1140381,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00136MBUM,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 7]","""The Backwoods"" (original title ""Bosque de sombras"") follow the story of two married couples holidaying in Spain and their nightmarish experiences. One couple is played by Gary Oldman and Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n and the other by Paddy Considine and Virginie Ledoyen. I don't know why, but the time is set in the 1970s. Perhaps they wanted to call up the memories of two masterpieces made in the 70s: ""Straw Dogs"" and ""Deliverance.""In fact, Paddy Considine's mild-mannered character Norman might remind us of Dustin Hoffmann's hero in the Sam Peckinpah classic. Two male characters Norman and Oldman's Paul, who has an assertive personality, travel to the ""backwoods"" in Spain with their wives for a summer holiday only to get involved with conflict with the locals after finding a little girl imprisoned in a shack.If you look at the DVD jacket of the film, you will find the filmmakers are using the face and name of Gary Oldman to attract potential viewers. It is understandable. As you know, he is an excellent actor, whose charismatic performance alone is always worth the money you pay. But I must say that in ""The Backwoods"" the task of carrying the whole story to the end is not given to the character Oldman plays. You wish you could see more of his acting, which is not his best, it is certain, but surely his presence could have raised the tension of the film a little higher than it is.In fact ""The Backwoods"" takes too much time to build up the tension it really needs. The film's pace gets faster in the second, but it never delivers the goods it promised at the beginning of the story. It tries to tell its story with a psychological depth, but female characters are bland, almost like ciphers, and as to the male ones the character development looks too sudden, which needs more insight.""The Backwoods"" is directed by Spanish-born Koldo Serra. Like many recent Spanish-made thrillers, the cinematography is very atmospheric. Actually, each scene is shot professionally; violence erupts at times and ugliness of human nature is shown, but ""The Backwoods"" does not really thrill or surprise us with raw energy or depth that this kind of film needs.It is not that ""The Backwoods"" is awful. It is just that the film needs some distinctive style that sets that apart from others.",3,Gary Oldman and Paddy Considine in So-so Spanish Thriller,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,2300,"['Backwoods', 'original', 'title', 'Bosque', 'de', 'sombras', 'follow', 'story', 'two', 'married', 'couples', 'holidaying', 'Spain', 'nightmarish', 'experiences', 'One', 'couple', 'played', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Aitana', 'S', 'aacute', 'nchez-Gij', 'oacute', 'other', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Virginie', 'Ledoyen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'time', 'set', '1970s', 'Perhaps', 'wanted', 'call', 'up', 'memories', 'two', 'masterpieces', 'made', '70s', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'Deliverance', 'fact', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'mild-mannered', 'character', 'Norman', 'might', 'remind', 'Dustin', 'Hoffmann', 'hero', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'classic', 'Two', 'male', 'characters', 'Norman', 'Oldman', 'Paul', 'who', 'assertive', 'personality', 'travel', 'backwoods', 'Spain', 'wives', 'summer', 'holiday', 'only', 'get', 'involved', 'conflict', 'locals', 'finding', 'little', 'girl', 'imprisoned', 'shack.If', 'look', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'using', 'face', 'name', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'attract', 'potential', 'viewers', 'understandable', 'know', 'excellent', 'actor', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'alone', 'always', 'worth', 'money', 'pay', 'must', 'say', 'Backwoods', 'task', 'carrying', 'whole', 'story', 'end', 'not', 'given', 'character', 'Oldman', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'acting', 'not', 'best', 'certain', 'surely', 'presence', 'could', 'have', 'raised', 'tension', 'film', 'little', 'higher', 'fact', 'Backwoods', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'tension', 'really', 'film', 'pace', 'faster', 'second', 'never', 'goods', 'promised', 'beginning', 'story', 'tell', 'story', 'psychological', 'depth', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'bland', 'almost', 'ciphers', 'male', 'ones', 'character', 'development', 'too', 'sudden', 'more', 'insight', 'Backwoods', 'directed', 'Spanish-born', 'Koldo', 'Serra', 'many', 'recent', 'Spanish-made', 'thrillers', 'cinematography', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'Actually', 'scene', 'shot', 'professionally', 'violence', 'erupts', 'times', 'ugliness', 'human', 'nature', 'shown', 'Backwoods', 'not', 'really', 'thrill', 'surprise', 'raw', 'energy', 'depth', 'kind', 'film', 'needs.It', 'not', 'Backwoods', 'awful', 'just', 'film', 'distinctive', 'style', 'apart', 'others']",The Backwoods
