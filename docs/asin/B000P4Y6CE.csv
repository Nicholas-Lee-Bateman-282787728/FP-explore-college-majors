1068436,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000P4Y6CE,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 4]","The title Great Happiness Space (2006) is derived from the Rakkyo host club in Osaka, Japan, a happy space in a night club frequented by young females whose dreams are fulfilled by young male attention - the Japanese Host Boys.The focus is on the club's owner Issei, who along with his staff of host boys party with the girls, sweet talk them, tell them what they want to hear, establish fake relationships, drink expensive champagnes, sex and all about keeping them and getting to their pocketbooks.  This isn't a one on one deal, the young men sit the evening with several women.  But primarily, the evening is spent chugging down very very expensive champagne.Where do the girls get the money, you might ask?  Prostitution.  It averages that 80 percent of the patrons are prostitutes earning a ton of money, who in turn, blow it on their fantasy guys.  The circle of money.We get a glimpse of the hiring of the young men, looking cool, dyed hair, nice clothes, and oozing with an appeal to girls.  The prostitutes are easy to persuade, with low self-esteem, lost souls, lonely, as prostitution is not about the sex and love.  So, here, the escape to fantasy revolves around love and attention, regardless of reality or price.The documentary does not answer some questions.  It seems these girls make hundreds in a night, and perform in seedy street rooms, as the film leads us to believe.  We are not informed about the logistics of spending thousands in these clubs, do they have expensive drug habits?  Shop pimps? Rent?  Apartments?  Families to support?  Education?  I did not come away determining where, other than the club, does their money go??As far as the male hosts who can earn $30,000 in a month {that's what they say}, the camera follows them home one evening and ""home"" did not appear to be penthouses.  So the viewer is left without pertinent information as a followup to the excessive income for young men.  It is mentioned how their excess drinking can damage to the liver.  What happens to these men when they choose not to continue this career?  Otherwise, this is an opening of your eyes documentary that many have not been exposed to before.  ......Rizzo",4,The Circle of Money!,1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,2179,"['title', 'Great', 'Happiness', 'Space', '2006', 'derived', 'Rakkyo', 'host', 'club', 'Osaka', 'Japan', 'happy', 'space', 'night', 'club', 'frequented', 'young', 'females', 'dreams', 'are', 'fulfilled', 'young', 'male', 'attention', 'Japanese', 'Host', 'Boys.The', 'focus', 'club', 'owner', 'Issei', 'who', 'staff', 'host', 'boys', 'party', 'girls', 'sweet', 'talk', 'tell', 'what', 'want', 'hear', 'establish', 'fake', 'relationships', 'drink', 'expensive', 'champagnes', 'sex', 'keeping', 'getting', 'pocketbooks', ""n't"", 'one', 'one', 'deal', 'young', 'men', 'sit', 'evening', 'several', 'women', 'primarily', 'evening', 'spent', 'chugging', 'down', 'very', 'very', 'expensive', 'champagne.Where', 'do', 'girls', 'get', 'money', 'might', 'ask', 'Prostitution', '80', 'percent', 'patrons', 'are', 'earning', 'ton', 'money', 'who', 'turn', 'blow', 'fantasy', 'guys', 'circle', 'money.We', 'get', 'glimpse', 'hiring', 'young', 'men', 'looking', 'cool', 'dyed', 'hair', 'nice', 'clothes', 'oozing', 'appeal', 'girls', 'prostitutes', 'are', 'easy', 'persuade', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'lost', 'souls', 'lonely', 'prostitution', 'not', 'sex', 'love', 'So', 'here', 'escape', 'fantasy', 'revolves', 'love', 'attention', 'regardless', 'reality', 'price.The', 'documentary', 'not', 'answer', 'questions', 'girls', 'make', 'hundreds', 'night', 'perform', 'seedy', 'street', 'rooms', 'film', 'believe', 'are', 'not', 'informed', 'logistics', 'spending', 'thousands', 'clubs', 'do', 'have', 'expensive', 'drug', 'habits', 'Shop', 'Rent', 'Apartments', 'Families', 'support', 'Education', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'away', 'determining', 'where', 'other', 'club', 'money', 'go', 'As', 'far', 'male', 'hosts', 'who', 'can', 'earn', '30,000', 'month', 'what', 'say', 'camera', 'home', 'one', 'evening', 'home', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'penthouses', 'viewer', 'left', 'pertinent', 'information', 'followup', 'excessive', 'income', 'young', 'men', 'mentioned', 'how', 'excess', 'drinking', 'can', 'damage', 'liver', 'What', 'men', 'when', 'choose', 'not', 'continue', 'career', 'Otherwise', 'opening', 'eyes', 'documentary', 'many', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'exposed', 'Rizzo']",The Great Happiness Space (Original Japanese Version with English Subtitles)
1068437,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000P4Y6CE,Chris Luallen,"[10, 11]","This is an excellent documentary about a host club in Osaka called Cafe Rakkyo. The owner is an energetic, charismatic guy named Issei. Issei and his fellow ""host boys"" spend the evening talking, singing, flirting, drinking and sometimes having sex with a variety of women who pay big money for their company.I expected the majority of the female customers to be older and perhaps unattractive. But instead most were as young and good looking as their male hosts. In fact, about 70%-80% were prostitutes and others who worked in Japan's vast and very kinky sex industry. This explains how these women could afford to pay so much for an evening's entertainment. Issei claimed to be able to make as much as $50,000 a month while one of the female customers said she had spent as much as $7,000 in a single night. The host boys' favorite technique of manipulation was to create the ""illusion of love"" and thus get the infatuated girl to keep returning in hopes of an eventual relationship outside the club. As another reviewer mentioned, there also seemed to be an element of pimping involved. Many of the women in the sex industry tried to rationalize their jobs by saying they needed to keep making the big bucks so they could afford to ""support"" their beloved host boy.Trying to understand the pyschology behind all this is a  complicated task and I am certainly not the one to do it. But one thing I did notice, while travelling in Japan, is that none of the 4 women I dated would allow me to pay for anything, even dinner, and so all costs were shared. My only explanation is that traditional Japanese society is so sexist that perhaps these ""modern"" women are determined to escape the bonds of male domination by using their newly acquired economic power. That certainly seemed to be part of the ""turn on"" for the female customers at Cafe Rakkyo.In any case, I found the subject matter to be fascinating and would recommend this doc to anyone interested in human sexuality and gender identity.",5,The Strange World Of Japanese Host Clubs,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,1996,"['excellent', 'documentary', 'host', 'club', 'Osaka', 'called', 'Cafe', 'Rakkyo', 'owner', 'energetic', 'charismatic', 'guy', 'named', 'Issei', 'Issei', 'fellow', 'host', 'boys', 'spend', 'evening', 'talking', 'singing', 'flirting', 'drinking', 'sometimes', 'having', 'sex', 'variety', 'women', 'who', 'pay', 'big', 'money', 'company.I', 'expected', 'majority', 'female', 'customers', 'be', 'older', 'perhaps', 'unattractive', 'instead', 'most', 'were', 'young', 'good', 'looking', 'male', 'hosts', 'fact', 'about', '70', '%', '-80', '%', 'were', 'prostitutes', 'others', 'who', 'worked', 'Japan', 'vast', 'very', 'kinky', 'sex', 'industry', 'how', 'women', 'could', 'afford', 'pay', 'so', 'much', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'Issei', 'claimed', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'as', 'much', '50,000', 'month', 'one', 'female', 'customers', 'said', 'had', 'spent', 'as', 'much', '7,000', 'single', 'night', 'host', 'boys', 'favorite', 'technique', 'manipulation', 'was', 'create', 'illusion', 'love', 'thus', 'get', 'infatuated', 'girl', 'keep', 'returning', 'hopes', 'eventual', 'relationship', 'club', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'element', 'pimping', 'involved', 'Many', 'women', 'sex', 'industry', 'tried', 'rationalize', 'jobs', 'saying', 'needed', 'keep', 'making', 'big', 'bucks', 'could', 'afford', 'support', 'beloved', 'host', 'boy.Trying', 'understand', 'pyschology', 'complicated', 'task', 'am', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'notice', 'travelling', 'Japan', 'none', '4', 'women', 'dated', 'would', 'allow', 'pay', 'anything', 'even', 'dinner', 'so', 'costs', 'were', 'shared', 'only', 'explanation', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'society', 'so', 'sexist', 'perhaps', 'modern', 'women', 'are', 'determined', 'escape', 'bonds', 'male', 'domination', 'using', 'newly', 'acquired', 'economic', 'power', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'be', 'part', 'turn', 'female', 'customers', 'Cafe', 'Rakkyo.In', 'case', 'found', 'subject', 'matter', 'be', 'fascinating', 'would', 'recommend', 'doc', 'anyone', 'interested', 'human', 'sexuality', 'gender', 'identity']",The Great Happiness Space (Original Japanese Version with English Subtitles)

1068439,A3JI0XP54T2HQS,B000P4Y6CE,Dan Bergevin,"[1, 1]","I love the theme that comes up often in Japanese culture, the theme of ""who am I, and am I connected to my real self?"" This is a very pervasive theme in Sion Sono movies (particularly Noriko's Dinner Table) and has never been driven home with more force than with The Great Happiness Space.This is a film about a companion bar and the men who work there. They are paid to entertain women, and by ""entertain"" I mean eat with them, talk to them, pour them drinks and sing to them. Romantics and antics. And it's all paid for by the women, who develop obsessions with particular companions. Of course, each companion can't entertain just one person - they have rent to pay. So you end up with girls in contentious positions with other girls over guys who they pay to hang out with them. And most of these girls are full-time prostitutes.Through conversations with these companion clients you start to get a sense that the personalities they create in their lines of work, and the personalities they create when they are with ""their"" men, are both facades. What lies beneath is anyone's guess, there doesn't really seem to be any room in their lives for a real self. Being a prostitute, with the various roles that entails, and being the faux girlfriend to an employee of a companion bar, blurs the line of real personality to the point that it stops being the point. These girls seem to understand that they aren't really ""with"" the guys they pay to obsess over, but they don't really seem to care. It's bizarre and sad, and it's even profoundly existential when you consider your own self-made illusions and the careful constructs you use to keep them in operation.From no other source could I learn this much about myself or about the human need for companionship at any cost (literal financial cost and emotional cost as well). It's a well made film and it carries a powerful message that will have totally different implications for every viewer. For every person who watches this and sees nothing but a freaky mess of people, there will be someone who pauses and reflects.

1068440,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000P4Y6CE,Jeffery Mingo,"[4, 30]","This documentary looks at the world of men in host clubs.  Somewhere in the description, they say the men are ""male geisha.""  This is true in that their job entails making the opposite sex happy in festive settings.  However, geisha are trained to sing, dance, and play instruments; these men seemed to just flirt.  Also, I got the sense that geisha mostly worked for men older than them.  The female clients here were young, probably same-age.I don't want to continue demeaning stereotypes of Asians ""looking alike.""  Still, all the males here had dyed hair, were about the same weight, height, and age, and wore similar clothes.  They did seem like clones of each other.This documentary is filmed in Osaka, rather than Tokyo.  Too often, a country's biggest city gets all the attention and the other towns are rendered invisible:  London, Paris, Kingston, Cairo, etc.  I am glad a different part of Japan was covered.I really think the subtitles may have been lying.  When the women stated how much they spend on male hosts, dollar signs come up, but it must be yen.  I can see someone blowing 40,000 yen in one night, but you'd have to be Trump or Gates to blow $40,000 in the same time, as the subtitles say.By speaking only to the hosts and their clients, this felt surface-y or watered down.

1068441,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000P4Y6CE,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[19, 24]","I don't know much about the Japanese industry on this but I thought it was a interesting outlook. Throughout the world almost everyone that visits strip clubs or even brothels enters the exchange with the understanding that it's just flesh for money. ""The Great Happiness Space,"" is a documentary by director Jake Clennell. Clennel profound us into the world of Japanese host clubs in after hours Osaka. Here, young men spend their nights providing physical but mostly emotional attention to women - or clients as they're referred to. In the early evening men pace the streets and woo women into a club in hopes of scoring a wealthy girl in needs of lip service.Upon first visit the woman selects a ""host"" from a book, and he becomes the person that she will always spend time with. Often multiple women spend time with the same host. Competition, more accurately financial competition, ensues for the host's attention. A talented host can find themselves making thousands of dollars per night. In the U.S. women have the upper hand in nightlife entertainment. They are handed free drinks and always command attention from men individually or in groups. Even strip clubs, once considered blighted trash accessible only from neon lit back alleys, have become more acceptable as entertainment venues for both men and women.The opposite exists at 'Cafe Rakkyo' in Osaka. The men of this and other host clubs seduce women with sweet talk, understanding, champagne, and large stuffed teddy bears. These women pay out the nose for the attention and companionship of the hosts. And they know that the attention and companionship is an act, but conversely they admit that an emotional connection exists. If the women suffer emotionally then the men suffer equally as much physically. Owner Issei explains that the trickiest part is keeping female clients ""in the dream,"" - that is the host must continue to sell the dream that they could be together and in love at some point. When reality hits, as it did for one client, the game is done.My only fall out about this film is that it dragged a bit long and not really develop into any profound conclusions.  Both sides are brutally honest in discussing their realities, to the point it makes everyone else in the world seem like an opportunist just like them. The truth is, this is what everyone else is doing in every relationship in their lives. Telling people what they want to hear, going along with what happens at work because you need the paycheck and compromising your virtues to the point of denial. The gigolos convince themselves what they're doing is justifiable. Strangely, the men seemed more effeminate than the women. Putting a lot of effort into their hair and jewelry, to the point of becoming freakish. Another interesting analogy is that these gigolo boys seem to be ""pimps"" to the females in the movie. The females sell their bodies to make money to spend on the males. I certainly don't believe Osaka as a whole is nearly that seedy.

It's a pity in a way, but such pleasures are available only to the wealthy, or to young women who themselves work in the sex industry to afford the services of the ""selling hosts"" whom we get to meet, one by one.Cleverly the director of the documentary takes us there through a classic narrative strategy--the old ""first day on the job"""" bit, as we see a young man right off the farm, good looking but dressed plain, like an Amish bumpkin, and he impresses Issei with his deep respevct and obedience.  Soon he will be making $25,000, $30,000 a month.  I wonder what these boys do with all that money?And also, we see that all of their clients are actually slaving away in order to be able to afford their visits to the great happiness space, and the implication is that the hosts are having sex with these women.  The main host, Issei, says that he personally has slept with five hundred clients in the past year.  What we see however, is a lot of flirting and drinking and sitting next to each other, for which the women are charged exorbitant sums.  For such a seedy film, the movie is strangely coy about showing anything resembling actual sex between client and host--when, where do they do it, and most intriguingly, if a bottle of champagne is $10,000, then how much do they have to spend to feel the mighty loins of Issei heave within them?

1068445,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B000P4Y6CE,stoic,"[6, 6]","The Great Happiness Space is a unique documentary about ""host clubs"" in Osaka, Japan. The hosts are male prostitutes who entertain lonely women at the clubs. The movie is fascinating both for what it says about Japanese culture and for the reasons women give for hiring prostitutes.Viewers leave the familiar and descend into Osaka's neon-filled nightlife. The filmmakers focus both on the hosts and on their clients. The different perspectives give the film depth.The men are money-hungry cynics. Some are making small fortunes, but very few would-be hosts succeed. Hosts tell conflicting stories about ""how far they go"" with clients. All of the men have longish, tinted hair; by Western standards, they look somewhat feminine. Viewers see amusing scenes of hosts trying to ""hustle"" women who are walking down the street.The surprisingly-young women who visit the clubs do so in hopes of bonding with a host. One woman confesses that she broke up with her fiancee after falling in love with her host. The viewer's heart breaks for her when the host later tells the filmmaker what he thinks of her.My wife and I both loved this film. If I had to complain, I would say that the filmmakers might have asked the men about their lives away from work - especially their ""real"" relationships with women. The film is in Japanese with English subtitles; it didn't bother us, but some people dislike subtitles.To learn about a different side of Japan, The Great Happiness Space is a difficult film to top.",5,Another Side of Japan,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,1496,"['Great', 'Happiness', 'Space', 'unique', 'documentary', 'host', 'clubs', 'Osaka', 'Japan', 'hosts', 'are', 'male', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'entertain', 'lonely', 'women', 'clubs', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'what', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'reasons', 'women', 'give', 'hiring', 'prostitutes.Viewers', 'leave', 'familiar', 'descend', 'Osaka', 'neon-filled', 'nightlife', 'filmmakers', 'focus', 'hosts', 'clients', 'different', 'perspectives', 'give', 'film', 'depth.The', 'men', 'are', 'money-hungry', 'cynics', 'are', 'making', 'small', 'fortunes', 'very', 'few', 'would-be', 'hosts', 'succeed', 'Hosts', 'tell', 'conflicting', 'stories', 'how', 'far', 'go', 'clients', 'men', 'have', 'longish', 'tinted', 'hair', 'Western', 'standards', 'look', 'somewhat', 'feminine', 'Viewers', 'see', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'hosts', 'trying', 'hustle', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'walking', 'down', 'street.The', 'surprisingly-young', 'women', 'who', 'visit', 'clubs', 'do', 'so', 'hopes', 'bonding', 'host', 'One', 'woman', 'broke', 'up', 'fiancee', 'falling', 'love', 'host', 'viewer', 'heart', 'breaks', 'when', 'host', 'later', 'filmmaker', 'what', 'her.My', 'wife', 'loved', 'film', 'had', 'complain', 'would', 'say', 'filmmakers', 'might', 'have', 'asked', 'men', 'lives', 'away', 'work', 'especially', 'real', 'relationships', 'women', 'film', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'people', 'dislike', 'subtitles.To', 'learn', 'different', 'side', 'Japan', 'Great', 'Happiness', 'Space', 'difficult', 'film', 'top']",The Great Happiness Space (Original Japanese Version with English Subtitles)
