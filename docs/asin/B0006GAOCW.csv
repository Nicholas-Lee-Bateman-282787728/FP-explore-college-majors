His daughter, Susan Ford, married her Secret Service agent, I believe. The audience might not even know there WAS a President called ""Gerald Ford""!So I enjoyed it cause it reminded me of the REAL press at the time that  a REAL ""Love Story"" actually happened in the White House. Didn't see ""Chasing Liberty"". Caught ""First Daughter"" on FX channel. Thoroughly LOVED it. Clean, wholesome poking fun at the tabloids that cover the REAL ""First Daughters"". The script uses all the girls who grew up in the White House for its basis - up to and including the Bush twins bouts with drinking...The chemistry between Mark Blucas and Katie Holmes  - dancing to the wonderful carefully selected music and their first date at the fair  - was gloriously innocent!

867404,A2MJZ8YVV229P3,B0006GAOCW,"Anna Banana ""AB""","[3, 3]","To be perfectly honest, after the first hour I thought I had the whole movie figured out... and then it twisted in the opposite direction and I was totally shocked!Katie Holmes plays Samantha MacKenzie, the President's Daughter who is trying to fit in and have a normal college experience. Only there are some things in her way, such as security guards following her everywhere, press close on her tail, and she just can't get rid of her White House mannerisms that kinda make everyone around her flinch and go ""what was that?"" Amerie plays her roommate Mia who is used to lots of attention and has trouble letting it go. Seemingly perfect timing, Sam meets her perfect guy (Marc Blucas playing James)... a little too perfect at first, as they are both brainiacs, kind, funny and well, he's crazy about her. It seems everything is going to work out perfectly! I was almost disappointed when the movie twisted in a completely different direction!While I was at first shocked, I quickly got over it and was pleasantly surprised and proud that the script succeeded in being unpredictable (because most movies are predictable). Then I became disappointed. It seemed the film was going steady in a good direction, and I felt kind of let down, like they could have done more, like the story could have developed into something truly charming and touching, however it seems they decided to veer away from the romance of the film and focus more on the main character's adolescance and learning about herself. It seemed to me like the movie was strolling along and then suddenly dropped off a cliff, however safely landing.It was not unpleasant. Despite the twist, they managed to give it a cute (although almost cliff hanger) ending, and a beautiful final scene. I must admit I was slightly disappointed with the outcome between Sam and James, but I guess I can't always be satisfied!A very entertaining film however some letdowns and [I feel] almost unnecessary twists. Nevertheless, I have no doubt you will enjoy it as I did. The script is witty and aimed more at preteens and teens then adults, as it is completely clean, and some of the jokes just won't reach adults as they are just not very funny, however I think I might have laughed at them when I was younger so it's not totally hopeless.The acting makes up for most of these faults however, as Katie Holmes was charming and fun to watch, as was Marc Blucas who isn't exactly ugly either!",4,unpredictable! refreshing!,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,2440,"['be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'first', 'hour', 'thought', 'had', 'whole', 'movie', 'figured', 'out', 'then', 'twisted', 'opposite', 'direction', 'was', 'totally', 'shocked', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Samantha', 'MacKenzie', 'President', 'Daughter', 'who', 'trying', 'fit', 'have', 'normal', 'college', 'experience', 'Only', 'are', 'things', 'way', 'such', 'security', 'guards', 'following', 'everywhere', 'press', 'close', 'tail', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'rid', 'White', 'House', 'mannerisms', 'kinda', 'make', 'everyone', 'flinch', 'go', 'what', 'was', 'Amerie', 'roommate', 'Mia', 'who', 'used', 'lots', 'attention', 'trouble', 'letting', 'go', 'Seemingly', 'perfect', 'timing', 'Sam', 'perfect', 'guy', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'playing', 'James', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'first', 'are', 'brainiacs', 'kind', 'funny', 'well', 'crazy', 'everything', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'perfectly', 'was', 'almost', 'disappointed', 'when', 'movie', 'twisted', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'was', 'first', 'shocked', 'quickly', 'got', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'proud', 'script', 'succeeded', 'being', 'unpredictable', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'predictable', 'Then', 'became', 'disappointed', 'seemed', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'steady', 'good', 'direction', 'felt', 'kind', 'let', 'down', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'something', 'truly', 'charming', 'touching', 'however', 'decided', 'veer', 'away', 'romance', 'film', 'focus', 'more', 'main', 'character', 'adolescance', 'learning', 'seemed', 'movie', 'was', 'strolling', 'along', 'then', 'suddenly', 'dropped', 'off', 'cliff', 'however', 'safely', 'landing.It', 'was', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'twist', 'managed', 'give', 'cute', 'almost', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'ending', 'beautiful', 'final', 'scene', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'outcome', 'Sam', 'James', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'be', 'satisfied', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'however', 'letdowns', '[', 'feel', ']', 'almost', 'unnecessary', 'twists', 'Nevertheless', 'have', 'doubt', 'will', 'enjoy', 'did', 'script', 'witty', 'aimed', 'more', 'preteens', 'teens', 'then', 'adults', 'completely', 'clean', 'jokes', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reach', 'adults', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'however', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'laughed', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'not', 'totally', 'hopeless.The', 'acting', 'up', 'most', 'faults', 'however', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'was', 'charming', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'who', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'ugly', 'either']",N/A

When I finally saw this movie, I realized that I couldn't expect anything less from Jerry O'Connell. I'm not quite sure if that's a compliment... but I still enjoyed this movie. It's very formula, very sappy, yet there's something about Katie Holmes and Marc Blucas that just sorta clicked.This is a sweet little movie about daddy's (the President's) little girl, who just wants to have a normal life without the photographers or the swarming secret service. Her respite is a college 3,000 miles away from that big, white house she lives in. Her conflicts include a jealous roommate who's used to being the center of attention, bad press because of her ""crazy"" behavior at a couple of parties, and meeting and falling for the totally hot resident advisor (Blucas). Michael Keaton co-stars as the President and Jerry O'Connell provides an unneeded, extremely cheesy narration at the beginning and end.Yes, this movie is very similar to Chasing Libery, a film that I actually like better, mainly because Mandy Moore's turn as the First Daughter had more punch and less sap. The one thing I liked better about First Daughter is the way the ""big twist"" is handled, which I won't giveaway here... though I will say that in First Daughter I was surprised and in Chasing Liberty I expected it. I probably didn't expect the twist in this movie because I had already seen it once and didn't think the movies would be quite that similar, but oh well, it was handled better here. Added all up, however, Chasing Liberty wins... but certainly don't ignore this one.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 10]","If you're looking for a good family film with clean language, clean scenes, and a clean script, you couldn't go wrong here. FIRST DAUGHTER has all those prerequisites.The film introduces us to Samantha (Katie Holmes, PIECES OF APRIL) who happens to be the daughter of the current President of the United States -- played well by Michael Keaton (BATMAN). She's on her way to college and adulthood but with little emotional support from her mother and father. Every aspect of her life has been laid out for her, and now she has to try and find out ""who"" she is. Is she really happy? Does she have an opinion on ...well ...anything?The film pulls us through her early time at Redmond University but does so using a lopsided script and rushed revelations. She has to contend with the overbearing status of her secret service contingent, her every move being tracked by the tabloids, and a roommate who has personal baggage of her own.Although the film was at times touching (especially when Keaton and Holmes are on screen together as father and daughter), the script rushes us through any trials and tribulations, as well as life-changes regarding parenthood and growing up.Also the movie felt like an overly sweet pill that was difficult to swallow. Even though Samantha had problems, there was never anything even remotely obstacle-like that she couldn't have easily overcome with her available resources (as shown when she takes her friends on a trip in an Air Force One jet; which, by the way, would NEVER happen, so credibility was seriously lost there).But I'm sure this film will have a pretty powerful appeal to the preteens and early teens out there.

This is the main idea behind ""First Daughter"", a film about a girl who has spent most of her life in the spotlight and longs to be treated like an ordinary person.This movie follows a typical movie formula. We have all seen plenty of films involving young adults moving away to go to college and this movie isn't much different. It follows this young girl as she moves far away from her parent's residence at the White House; gets followed around by security personnel; meets a guy and falls for him; and struggles with the media to protect her privacy and reputation.What makes this movie fail in the end is its lack of any real story and the lack of any feeling for the characters. Michael Keaton's portrayal as the U.S. president isn't that good, and you really get annoyed by his indifference toward his daughter. Actress Margaret Colin seems out of place as well. She plays Keaton's wife, and she has very little to say in this movie.If there is anything redeeming about this film, it would have to be Katie Holmes in the lead role. Katie is a pretty woman, but in a cute and innocent way. This makes her character that much more compelling. She seems so helpless and so sweet, you can't help but root for her to triumph over the media and its annoying and unethical treatment of her.

How else do we describe the eerily similar ""First Daughter"" and ""Chasing Liberty."" Let's be honest, if these movies had come out 5 years apart people still would have raised eyebrows at the similarities.  That said this movie was quite bad and I just don't know who would be interested in this film. If anything it says that we like our movies just as we like our politicians: light and fluffy. There is no edge here at all. Good luck figuring out which party this president is supposed to represent (I'm guessing Republican, but it is highly debatable).  Plus this film's idea of rebellion is...um...sliding down a hill? Dancing on a table? Drinking alcohol? Wow...hardcore. I also find it a bit disingenuous when these princess movies make money off telling kids that really it's best to be ""normal"" and that being privileged is overrated, and then following it up with a scene of unrestrained greed. The reason they do that is that in reality all kids want to be rich far more than they want to be normal and the filmmakers know this. I also have to somewhat dump on Katie Holmes performance here. For somebody who seems to have potential choosing this cream puff role did nothing to impress me.  Even when she was supposed to be angry in this film she came off as timid. My question to you is this: Can Katie Holmes play any role other than Joey from ""Dawson's Creek?"" Can she play angry, mean, crazy. . .or is sweet all she does? In this case she was severely upstaged by Amerie who played her roommate. I also did not like the way that the film seemed to have no new idea's in its head. For example, how clich&eacute;d to have it so that Holmes' character doesn't like ""Hail to the Chief."" For most of the film I didn't have the energy to build up a strong dislike it, but then it kept going and going, with happy ending piled on top of happy ending. By the time they got done piling happiness on me I was quite angry to say the least. **1/4",2,I Wonder if that Stud is a Special Agent,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,2113,"['what', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'ruses', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'last', 'year', 'somebody', 'sold', 'exact', 'same', 'script', 'two', 'directors', 'had', 'movie', 'made', 'twice', 'How', 'else', 'do', 'describe', 'eerily', 'similar', 'First', 'Daughter', 'Chasing', 'Liberty', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'movies', 'had', 'come', 'out', '5', 'years', 'apart', 'people', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'similarities', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'bad', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'film', 'anything', 'like', 'movies', 'just', 'politicians', 'light', 'fluffy', 'edge', 'here', 'Good', 'luck', 'figuring', 'out', 'party', 'president', 'supposed', 'represent', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Republican', 'highly', 'debatable', 'film', 'idea', 'rebellion', 'um', 'sliding', 'down', 'hill', 'Dancing', 'table', 'Drinking', 'alcohol', 'Wow', 'hardcore', 'also', 'find', 'bit', 'disingenuous', 'when', 'princess', 'movies', 'make', 'money', 'telling', 'kids', 'really', 'best', 'be', 'normal', 'being', 'privileged', 'overrated', 'then', 'following', 'up', 'scene', 'unrestrained', 'greed', 'reason', 'do', 'reality', 'kids', 'want', 'be', 'rich', 'far', 'more', 'want', 'be', 'normal', 'filmmakers', 'know', 'also', 'have', 'somewhat', 'dump', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'performance', 'here', 'somebody', 'who', 'have', 'potential', 'choosing', 'cream', 'puff', 'role', 'did', 'nothing', 'impress', 'Even', 'when', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'angry', 'film', 'came', 'off', 'timid', 'question', 'Can', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'play', 'role', 'other', 'Joey', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Can', 'play', 'angry', 'mean', 'crazy', '.or', 'sweet', 'case', 'was', 'severely', 'upstaged', 'Amerie', 'who', 'played', 'roommate', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'seemed', 'have', 'new', 'idea', 'head', 'example', 'how', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'have', 'so', 'Holmes', 'character', ""n't"", 'like', 'Hail', 'Chief', 'most', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy', 'build', 'up', 'strong', 'dislike', 'then', 'kept', 'going', 'going', 'happy', 'ending', 'piled', 'top', 'happy', 'ending', 'time', 'got', 'done', 'piling', 'happiness', 'was', 'quite', 'angry', 'say', 'least', '**1/4']",N/A

Yet the movie on the whole can still hand out nice surprises every now and then. Katie Holmes has a unique face and looks intelligent enough to want to be independent as well as not to disappoint the First family. More importantly, Marc Blucas (her love interest) is not like the stereotyped Prince Charming for a teenager. At least he also looks sophisticated and mature and gives a strong case why the first daughter would fall for him. The two make an attractive couple and are on the same wavelength when they share the views on science etc.The twist in the movie, at least I didn't see it coming, is good. Considering how many such plots have appeared on screen, I must say this one at least is not as predictable and does give me some credibility as a story about real people. The President and First Lady are not given a significant part here. The young couple already is a good reason to watch the movie. The love songs that accompanied the ball room dances are pleasant and well-chosen.

867419,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B0006GAOCW,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[24, 29]","Katie Holmes proves charming as daughter of the President of the United States in the romantic drama `First Daughter.' From director Forest Whitaker, `First Daughter' features Holmes' playing the character of Samantha Mackenzie - a freshman who navigates college classes, while dealing with testy roommates and romantic entanglements - all under the ever watching eyes of a cadre of Secret Service bodyguards.Add Michael Keaton as a President running for reelection and Marc Blucas (from the television series `Buffy the Vampire Slayer') as a graduate student with a secret agenda to the mix and the ingredients are all here for an enjoyable, if not intellectually stimulating, diversion for a couple of hours.Where this DVD fails, however, is its delivery on special features. We have a very short featurette on the choreographed ballroom dancing scenes, as well as a tribute piece to the famous composer Michael Kamen who died shortly after starting work on the picture.There are also two deleted scenes that are actually merely extensions on existing scenes - more birth control products for Samantha as she endeavors to make her boyfriend jealous and more of Holmes dancing on the bar. They add nothing to the picture and its quite obvious why the extra seconds were trimmed from the final theatrical release.Where the DVD does deliver the goods though is in the rather laid back commentary from the three young stars (Holmes, Blucas and Amerie). It starts a little slow, but soon livens up as the three began to relax. The three share some entertaining anecdotes about life on the set, and their experiences working with Michael Keaton. However, the commentary also highlights what is missing from the DVD as the three discuss all the outtakes from the picture, and Blucas even speculates (incorrectly as it turns out) as to their presence on the DVD.As is the case with so many releases these days, we have the cropped full-screen version on one side of the disc and the original theatrical widescreen presentation on the flip side, with the special features split (half on each side).",4,"Saw an advance DVD of this charming, family film",1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,2091,"['Katie', 'Holmes', 'charming', 'daughter', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'romantic', 'drama', 'First', 'Daughter', 'director', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'First', 'Daughter', 'features', 'Holmes', 'playing', 'character', 'Samantha', 'Mackenzie', 'freshman', 'who', 'college', 'classes', 'dealing', 'testy', 'roommates', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'ever', 'watching', 'eyes', 'cadre', 'Secret', 'Service', 'bodyguards.Add', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'President', 'running', 'reelection', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'television', 'series', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'graduate', 'student', 'secret', 'agenda', 'mix', 'ingredients', 'are', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'diversion', 'couple', 'hours.Where', 'DVD', 'however', 'delivery', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'very', 'short', 'featurette', 'choreographed', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'tribute', 'piece', 'famous', 'composer', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'who', 'died', 'shortly', 'starting', 'work', 'picture.There', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'merely', 'extensions', 'existing', 'scenes', 'more', 'birth', 'control', 'products', 'Samantha', 'make', 'boyfriend', 'jealous', 'more', 'Holmes', 'dancing', 'bar', 'add', 'nothing', 'picture', 'quite', 'obvious', 'why', 'extra', 'seconds', 'were', 'trimmed', 'final', 'theatrical', 'release.Where', 'DVD', 'deliver', 'goods', 'though', 'rather', 'laid', 'back', 'commentary', 'three', 'young', 'stars', 'Holmes', 'Blucas', 'Amerie', 'little', 'slow', 'soon', 'up', 'three', 'began', 'relax', 'three', 'share', 'entertaining', 'anecdotes', 'life', 'set', 'experiences', 'working', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'However', 'commentary', 'also', 'what', 'missing', 'DVD', 'three', 'discuss', 'outtakes', 'picture', 'Blucas', 'even', 'incorrectly', 'out', 'presence', 'DVD.As', 'case', 'so', 'many', 'releases', 'days', 'have', 'cropped', 'full-screen', 'version', 'one', 'side', 'disc', 'original', 'theatrical', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'flip', 'side', 'special', 'features', 'split', 'half', 'side']",N/A

The only reason I watched it was because I attempt to watch every movie that I can despite whether or not I know it's going to be awful just from watching a thirty second preview.First of all, I think that all movies that are about the 'first daughter' are going to suck. I think that, like the Defence Against the Dark Arts job at Hogwarts in the Harry Potter books, they're cursed or at least that's the rumour going around. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised. It's always the same story... overprotective father/president, mother/first lady that just wants the best for the election never mind the daughter's feelings, the first daughter is always an only child, and romance is always a key element. Oh yes, and the leading man always either betrays the leading lady (the first daughter) one way or another or is some guy that she meets whilst running away from the guys in the black suits with walkie talkies hidden in the lining of their clothing. Needless to say, this movie has all the cliches, therefore making the same mistakes as all the past `first daughter' movies.A cast full of ""today's"" popular actors and actresses, or at least the so-called ""hotties"", was evidently an effort to save the movie from the script's errors. Obviously, this little manoeuvre did not work. I saw right through that as soon as I realised exactly how poor the acting was. My guess was that they didn't even try. They knew the movie was going to flop and who wants to break a sweat over a movie that's not going to sell enough copies to buy them a brand new car? Certainly not Hollywood actors that's for sure.I suggest that not only do you not purchase this movie, you decide against buying any movies that centre around the first daughter. They're never going to make a good or realistic movie about the first daughter, so why waste your money? Save it and spend it on something that's actually good.

Her father and mother (Margaret Colin) accompany her to her California college with all the fanfare and security guards one might expect.  Sam wants to be 'just a normal person' and talks her assigned roommate Mia (Amerie Rogers) into sticking with her.  Despite the restrictions of 'life in a glass house', Sam finds joys and trials in trying to be a private person drowned in a public persona.  She falls for James her Residence Advisor (Marc Blucas) and that starts the errors in judgment that result in her being recalled to the White House until her father's election is over.  How Sam resolves her identity against the overwhelming odds and seeks her own existence is the punch of the closing of the film.In less than capable hands than those of Whitaker and his fine cast this film would have been extraneous bubble gum.  It just shows that good folks can give a weak plot a bit of pizzazz and manage to make some important social commentary despite a weak script.

Okay, she's the US President's daughter leaving the White House and isn't going incognito like Audrey Hepburn - but under the full glare of the media spotlight. This has obviously been inspired by Chelsea Clinton's much-publicised time at college, with burly big secret service agents always on tow to protect the Prez's little girl which becomes a predictable running gag throughout the movie.What starts out as a teen movie with a lippy black girlie sidekick sharing a dorm room with daddy's girl and plenty of Frat jokes and pumping soundtrack soon settles down in to a charming Princess Diaries type family film that will appeal to everyone who likes fun romantic comedies. A neat plot twist (which I won't give away) puts a clever spin on the love story and heightens the tension of this charming film.Katie Holmes, as always, is a delight to watch. Director Forest Whitaker does a great job and watch out for his brief cameo appearance as a presidential aide on board Air Force One (he also narrates the story). Michael Keaton seems a bit cold and distant at first as the Prez but soon loses his stuffiness and you warm to him by the end of the movie.Some great extras with deleted scenes and two features - Katie Holmes and love interest Marc Blucas being put through their paces as they learn ballroom dancing, and a tribute to composer Michael Kamen who died during the production but left a haunting fairytale theme tune that makes the film sparkle with gold dust.",4,ROMAN HOLIDAY STYLE ROMANTIC COMEDY,1119139200,"06 19, 2005",2005,1609,"['Reminiscent', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'star', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'playing', 'princess', 'sneaking', 'palace', 'bit', 'fun', 'Okay', 'US', 'President', 'daughter', 'leaving', 'White', 'House', ""n't"", 'going', 'incognito', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'full', 'glare', 'media', 'spotlight', 'obviously', 'been', 'inspired', 'Chelsea', 'Clinton', 'much-publicised', 'time', 'college', 'burly', 'big', 'secret', 'service', 'agents', 'always', 'tow', 'protect', 'Prez', 'little', 'girl', 'predictable', 'running', 'gag', 'movie.What', 'out', 'teen', 'movie', 'lippy', 'black', 'girlie', 'sidekick', 'sharing', 'dorm', 'room', 'daddy', 'girl', 'plenty', 'Frat', 'jokes', 'pumping', 'soundtrack', 'soon', 'down', 'charming', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'type', 'family', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'who', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'neat', 'plot', 'twist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'clever', 'spin', 'love', 'story', 'tension', 'charming', 'film.Katie', 'Holmes', 'always', 'delight', 'watch', 'Director', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'great', 'job', 'watch', 'out', 'brief', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'presidential', 'aide', 'board', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'also', 'story', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'bit', 'cold', 'distant', 'first', 'Prez', 'soon', 'stuffiness', 'warm', 'end', 'movie.Some', 'great', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'two', 'features', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'love', 'interest', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'being', 'put', 'paces', 'learn', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'tribute', 'composer', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'who', 'died', 'production', 'left', 'haunting', 'fairytale', 'theme', 'tune', 'film', 'sparkle', 'gold', 'dust']",N/A

867437,A22MQ2OAHY8SIJ,B0006GAOCW,"KittyKins ""KittyKins""","[0, 0]","I absolutely love this coming of age film that is a fictitious look at what could happen if the president's daughter went to college.  It's also a very touching love story.  To start I have to say that I had a very hard time finding this film!  I had seen a preview a long time ago, but didn't see it in the theatre.  Finally through multiple searches (um...President's daughter...er...no) it came up.  I rented it on i-tunes and then loved it so much I bought the dvd.  This has got to be one of the most under-rated films in this genre and I wonder why when it's so well done!  I have read that it had many negative reviews, but keeping things in perspective, most movies of this genre are marked down by critics. Most of these well meaning people are males over 40 years of age who can't really understand why the film doesn't appeal to them (lol).  As someone who is a fan of this type of film, I have to say that it's one of the best in my collection and is comparable to movies such as ""The Princess Diaries"" and ""What a Girl Wants"".  It also has a great balance between touching moments, both happy and sad, and humour too.  It's one of my favourite love stories and is really enjoyable which is why I gave it 5 stars.  There is very little potentially offensive material which includes the odd mild swear and one quiet use of Christ's name, mention of birth control, and one incident of over-drinking as a minor.  I also enjoyed the effective use of music such as Sinatra's ""The Way You Look Tonight"" which added to the emotional intensity of many scenes.Samantha is the president's daughter and goes to Redmond College (thrilled that my Mom went there too).  In a gentle exaggeration of what could happen and what we hope the real president wouldn't do, she goes with a full security team and secret service agents.  This really hampers her ability to have any chance of enjoying the college experience.  Sam meets James who is in one of her classes and the two quickly bond.  Finally Sam is able to be herself, and as they fall in love, she enjoys some freedom and independence.  The romantic chemistry between Sam (Katie Holmes) and James (Marc Blucas) is just outstanding and they are a very stunning couple. This film showcases Katie Holmes' beauty and good acting ability, and in fact the whole film is very well acted.  At first I wasn't wild about how the president is portrayed, mostly because the president is a bit a jerk at times in how he relates to his daughter and seems to put his political aspirations above his daughter's happiness.  At times I imagined how it would be if Colin Firth was playing the role, but I guess he's not qualified with the British accent, haha.This film also highlights the problems that famous people face with being hounded by the paparazzi.  In the film Samantha mentions that the only time she had privacy was in utero.  This reminded me of the famous quote by Queen Elizabeth's favourite governess Marilyn Crawford, who said ""Royals are only private in the womb.""  Such a sad commentary about what has happened to many of our celebrities today!My only disappointment is that it does have a bit of a bitter-sweet ending and that it was sort of a set up for sequel that never happened. I would have loved to see the continuing story!

867439,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006GAOCW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[23, 32]","Do not confuse ""First Daughter"" with ""Chasing Liberty,"" even though both films are about the daughter of the President of the United States and the title of the former was the working title of the latter.  Actually these two films are a lot closer than ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact,"" but there was never a notion of the two films battling it out to be the best President's daughter movie of 2004 the way those films dueled for best object from space trying to hit the Earth movies did back in the summer of 1998.Having succeeded in progressing beyond the role of Joey that got her noticed on ""Dawson's Creek"" in films such as ""Wonder Boys"" and ""Pieces of April,"" Katie Holmes is forced to take a step backwards in this 2004 romantic comedy.  The same thing can be said for her leading man, Marc Blucas, who had his part in ""The Alamo"" left pretty much on the cutting room floor and is basically back to doing the Riley Finn character he played on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  Both Holmes and Blucas deserve better, but while the script is dressed up with the trappings of serious things, once you get passed those you are talking strictly predictable clich&eacute;s.  Although director Forest Whitaker adds some lyricism with the narration and opening sequence, the script keeps this one from really going anywhere good.Samantha Mackenzie (Holmes) is the only daughter of a first term President (Michael Keaton), and she is heading off to college during an election year.  Of course Sam yearns to be a normal kid when she arrives at the University of Redmond in California, but that is pretty hard when the school band and drunken frat boys are all doing ""Hall to the Chief,"" and pretty much impossible when reporters are sitting outside your dorm and you sit in class surrounded by roped off empty seats and a buffer of Secret Service agents between her and her classmates.  Sam's only initial success is in convincing her skeptical roommate, Mia Thompson (Amerie), to stick around for the fun and be the stalwart best bud through the nonsense to come.  Then she meets her new resident advisor, James Lansome (Blucas), and discovers for the first time in her life somebody with who she can be herself.The only problem with that is that given the political world in which she grew up it is hard to believe that Samantha Mackenzie ever had the chance to develop a real sense of self.  However, ""First Daughter"" has a bigger problem in trying to keep things real.  Since I started voting for President there have been a lot of teenage daughters in the White House, from Amy Carter to Chelsea Clinton and the Bush twins, and the basic rule has been to leave them alone (remember when ""Saturday Night Live"" apologized for making jokes about Chelsea?).  Clearly one source of inspiration for this movie has been the exception to this rule, which is when a first daughter is busted for underage drinking, because as we all know if a teenage girl makes a major mistake like that it is fodder for the national grist mill.But ""First Daughter"" jumps the gun on this one.  This is a film that has Joan Rivers making a joke about Sam looking like a terrorist had dressed her while the President is making thinly veiled references to exactly that possibility.  Even Jay Leno is making jokes on ""The Tonight Show"" about the way this teenage girl dresses before she actually does anything to embarrass her parents.  The justification is that Sam is a target throughout the entire film.  Students protesting her father's administration feel free to call her out on the quad and reporters with their cameras are apparently allowed to camp out in front of her dorm, when they are not stalking her out on the streets.  Yet in the real world such things would not be allowed and first daughters tend to be surrounded by a cadre of friends who fiercly protect their privacy.There is a moment in ""First Daughter"" where the film touches us when Sam is out jogging with her secret service detail, stops running, and breaks down.  The agents keep their distance and the sense of the painful bubble of isolation in which she lives her all too public life becomes palatable.  Her life has reached rock bottom at that point and as the rest of the film quickly plays by the numbers without trying to build on the emotions it has finally revealed.  Sam's mother (Margaret Colin) turns out to be a political Machiavelli, the election becomes more important than education, and the last act of the film disintegrates into real basic connect the dots to hurry along to the ending (despite some nice moments by Keaton).  Throughout the film Sam is being urged to say what she thinks and not what is written for her, but the big payoff for this I was expecting never showed up.  Then there is the final shot of the movie, which is supposed to be the requisite happy ending.  But ask yourself if Samantha really wants to be doing what she is doing given what she is wearing and what time it is?  Just so you know, the answers to both parts of the question would be ""No.""In terms of the obvious double-bill with ""Chasing Liberty,"" it would be interesting to see which one you like best because both films have pretty good chemistry between the boy and the girl but suffer from weak scripts and less than satisfactory endings.  In fact, the way both films jump to the (semi) ""happy"" ending is a rather odd coincidence, which is a strange complaint given they both have the same semi-shocking revelation.  I like Holmes' performance a bit more and the running gags with the secret service agents in this one, but the other film has better locations and more interesting supporting characters.  However, if these films did not have Katie Holmes and Mandy Moore as their starts I shudder to think that they would have each lost another star and have descended to the level of not worth

She gets to wear some sweet duds in this movie ala formal dresses.The little father-daughter connection between her and Michael Keaton was also sweet-I wanted to call my dad and tell him I loved him after watching it. What was up with the Mom though? She seemed kinda off and she gave a look to Katie's love interest at the ball that was a little drunk and pervy I think.I also thought the chemistry between her and the James guy was great-they would make really cute kids. Tell them to hook it up and grace the world with some uber pretty children. And the best part is the chemistry is like, PG rated, so you don't have the cover the kids' eyes at all-all you get is a couple kisses and a pretty mild shimi-shimi dance from Katie in hot pants during her not-so ""wild""acting out moment.All in all, a very sweet movie with a really asthetically pleasing cast(think of walking clearasil and noxema and whitestrip advertisments all melded into one-or uh, like several-body/bodies)- and don't miss seeing Amerie as Katie's roomie-she's a really great singer-in her movie debut.

867466,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006GAOCW,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 5]","I give only two stars to this Fox's romantic comedy ""First Daughter"" not because of its unlucky resemblance with Mandy Moore's ""Chasing Liberty"" or the acting of Katie Holmes, which is not bad at all. She is sweet and cute even though the film completely misses its target audiences by including her embarrassing `table dancing' sequences.No, I am disappointed by something else. ""First Daughter"" is pleasant, maybe too pleasant for me. I was thinking that the film is about the romantic life of Katie Holmes' character Samantha, only daughter of US President Mackenzie (Michael Keaton) running for the second term (reminding us of the real-life counterpart George W. Bush and his twin daughters). What happens if Samantha goes to college and falls in love with another student?Though some hints are given, the film wisely removes direct mention to the politics in real life. You don't know much about the president himself or his policies and party (except that he is very likable), but that kind of decision is understandable because the film is meant to be a romantic comedy that can be enjoyed by everyone.Still ""First Daughter"" does not have much romance in it. When the film should be romantic with Samantha's romance with the resident adviser Marc Blucas, it fails to be so, its romance interrupted by the unnecessary plot twist and the film's attitude after that point, which takes itself too seriously. The silly antics like water slide episode and Katie in blue bikini do not help, and neither does the subplot about Samantha's friendship with her roommate (played by Amerie).The film is directed by Forest Whitaker who won Oscar for his terrific acting in ""The Last King of Scotland."" I don't know what attracted him to this film, but I know his orthodox approach does not work here, ending up with rather tepid storytelling and bland characters. We need wit, satire, or at least biting kind of humor, and wilder romance and more imagination and fantasy.
