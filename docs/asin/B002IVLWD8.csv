1270881,A1ARPLFACHIK7Y,B002IVLWD8,"apriles78 ""aes78""","[1, 1]","With a title like Bollywood Dance Blast, you'd think this DVD would be ... well, more of a blast. First of all, Hemalayaa was all by herself, which I thought would be a plus since it would cut down on distractions. But her voice-overs were horrible. She actually faked shaking her voice to make it sound as if she were in the workout,. And while I was trying to adjust to this, she did it again. And again. Very hokey! The workouts were actually a lot better without Hemalayaa speaking (using the music only feature).There are two longer aerobic workouts that pretty much seem the same. The moves are repeated over and over. On the plus side, you will probably have no trouble learning the moves. On the negative side, you might get bored with the tedious redundancy.The best part of the DVD was the 5-minute extra bonus workout ... with the sound turned off. That way you won't have to hear about putting on your ""beautiful, sexy, spiritual boots"" and other silly nonsense.In this DVD, Hemalayaa isn't wearing what you see on the cover... anywhere. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would have bothered to purchase this if I had previewed it first. But at least it provides cardio workouts in a format that's a little more fun than some workouts out there.Hemalayaa is an enthusiastic instructor, but she really needs to work on how she presents and organizes her material. For more of a genuine Bollywood experience, get Hemalayaa: Bollywood Burn. That is more of a blast! Also, in Bollywood Burn Hemalayaa includes a cute Bollywood dance number in the blue costume she wears on the cover. It's great for getting the real deal Bollywood.",3,Where's the blast?,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,1650,"['title', 'Bollywood', 'Dance', 'Blast', ""'d"", 'think', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'more', 'blast', 'First', 'Hemalayaa', 'was', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'plus', 'would', 'cut', 'down', 'distractions', 'voice-overs', 'were', 'horrible', 'actually', 'faked', 'shaking', 'voice', 'make', 'sound', 'were', 'workout', 'was', 'trying', 'adjust', 'did', 'again', 'again', 'Very', 'hokey', 'workouts', 'were', 'actually', 'lot', 'better', 'Hemalayaa', 'speaking', 'using', 'music', 'only', 'feature', 'are', 'two', 'longer', 'aerobic', 'workouts', 'pretty', 'much', 'seem', 'same', 'moves', 'are', 'repeated', 'over', 'plus', 'side', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'trouble', 'learning', 'moves', 'negative', 'side', 'might', 'get', 'bored', 'tedious', 'redundancy.The', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', '5-minute', 'extra', 'bonus', 'workout', 'sound', 'turned', 'off', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'hear', 'putting', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'spiritual', 'boots', 'other', 'silly', 'nonsense.In', 'DVD', 'Hemalayaa', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'what', 'see', 'cover', 'anywhere', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'bothered', 'purchase', 'had', 'previewed', 'first', 'least', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'format', 'little', 'more', 'fun', 'workouts', 'out', 'there.Hemalayaa', 'enthusiastic', 'instructor', 'really', 'work', 'how', 'material', 'more', 'genuine', 'Bollywood', 'experience', 'get', 'Hemalayaa', 'Bollywood', 'Burn', 'more', 'blast', 'Also', 'Bollywood', 'Burn', 'Hemalayaa', 'cute', 'Bollywood', 'dance', 'number', 'blue', 'costume', 'cover', 'great', 'getting', 'real', 'deal', 'Bollywood']",N/A
1270882,A3F8DJPNU5NJ69,B002IVLWD8,K. M. Kline,"[16, 17]","I thouroughly enjoy the Bollywood workout series by Hemalayaa and was super excited when a new one came out. Hemalayaa's energy is a bit contagious, and she seems much more genuine than most workout gurus so I enjoy her workouts more. I hate some skinny girl who has never truly had to work out in her life saying ""good job"" every three seconds.What is different about this movie in the series is that it is less about the steps or moves and more about just getting moving. A lot of the movements truly have no right and wrong. They are just about having fun and getting your heartrate up.The one thing I didnt like at first was how focused her speech was on your spiritual cleansing. It seemed like we were more focused on getting rid of our negative energy than the weight. After you get into the workout more though you realize that she is just showing you the intent behind your movements so you can make them your own. This truly is less about learning a dance and more about just finding a way to get moving and have fun.While I love learning Bollywood dance choreography (though there are some elements of the bollywood dance such as the gita walk) and still really want to see her do a Bollywood dance workout with veils for arm toning, this is nice and a welcome addition to my ever growing workout dvd collection. I enjoyed hopping around, shaking my stuff, and definently worked up a good sweat!I would definently recommend this dvd to anyone who can let themselves go and have fun or anyone who has a willingness to do so!",4,Still waiting for that Bollywood Veil Workout Hemalayaa :),1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,1534,"['thouroughly', 'enjoy', 'Bollywood', 'workout', 'series', 'Hemalayaa', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'when', 'new', 'one', 'came', 'out', 'Hemalayaa', 'energy', 'bit', 'contagious', 'much', 'more', 'genuine', 'most', 'workout', 'gurus', 'enjoy', 'workouts', 'more', 'hate', 'skinny', 'girl', 'who', 'never', 'truly', 'had', 'work', 'out', 'life', 'saying', 'good', 'job', 'three', 'seconds.What', 'different', 'movie', 'series', 'less', 'steps', 'moves', 'more', 'about', 'just', 'getting', 'moving', 'lot', 'movements', 'truly', 'have', 'right', 'wrong', 'are', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'getting', 'heartrate', 'one', 'thing', 'didnt', 'first', 'was', 'how', 'focused', 'speech', 'was', 'spiritual', 'cleansing', 'seemed', 'were', 'more', 'focused', 'getting', 'rid', 'negative', 'energy', 'weight', 'get', 'workout', 'more', 'realize', 'just', 'showing', 'intent', 'movements', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'truly', 'less', 'learning', 'dance', 'more', 'about', 'just', 'finding', 'way', 'get', 'moving', 'have', 'fun.While', 'love', 'learning', 'Bollywood', 'dance', 'choreography', 'are', 'elements', 'bollywood', 'dance', 'such', 'gita', 'walk', 'still', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'do', 'Bollywood', 'dance', 'workout', 'veils', 'arm', 'toning', 'nice', 'welcome', 'addition', 'ever', 'growing', 'dvd', 'collection', 'enjoyed', 'hopping', 'around', 'shaking', 'stuff', 'definently', 'worked', 'up', 'good', 'sweat', 'would', 'definently', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'let', 'go', 'have', 'fun', 'anyone', 'who', 'willingness', 'do', 'so']",N/A

With that being said, this is not a dance workout strictly on technique. This features 2-20 minute cardio dance routines: REMOVING OBSTACLES and CELEBRATE. The choreography is uncomplicated and simple to follow. The basic dance moves for both workouts are the  ""Queen's March"" (regular march), ""Shake & Bake"" (a pivot & hip shake), ""Indian grapevine"" (grapevine with Indian arms) and ""Show walk"" (walk in a circle).  You'll do these repeatedly and with add-ons to increase cardio by adding movement in the upper body/arms/shoulder/hands, adding a hop, or increase to a faster pace.REMOVING OBSTACLES is just that, kick off your shoes and liberate yourself from anything holding you back or down. The movement will begin in the lower body, then move onto the upper body. You will remove your obstacles by moving as if you were ""sweeping"" it away and then ""stomping"" it in the ground.CELEBRATE with moves that convey giving and receiving.  You will shimmy and plie here plus all the basic moves. Fast percussion beat will assist you in the dance moves and add a cardio pace.Overall, it has a touch of mystic, spirituality, self-affirmations with an exotic Hemalayaa flair.

It's as if she were using the dance as some sort of magic and or for personal self growth. Great considering you get a fun workout in the process.Some of the moves I really enjoyed were the ""shake and bake"", touch down run celebration, and the magic hand flutters. She also has a really good energy and sense of humor. I loved her let your inner drama queen out comments.Also as some has mentioned she has a real genuine quality about her. She's the real deal and is not fakey.I also love how muscular she looks. You can tell she actually does the work out and has a proud self image that is not based on stereotypes. I highly recommend this video if your looking for something a little different in your workout.Finally i've seen her most recent Bollywood Party Workout DVD which I like the best. It's super fun and light hearted. She had me laughing and dancing the whole time. Again, a wonderful sense of humor. I loved her playfulness of dress with her gold Lamay stretch pants with shiny silver tassels. In this one she was comfortable enough to talk you through the workout as she danced along. I could tell she had really come into her own.
