767720,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000AQS8F,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","""Twas The Fight Before Christmas"" centers around the plot of spoiled Princess, who tricks Santa into giving a Christmas present only to her, and coal to the rest of the children all over the world including Powerpuff Girls. And what Princess gets is the superpower of chemical X, which allows her to fly like her hated Buttercup, Bubbles and Blossom.Special episode for PPG is nothing special as far as its story goes on, but still the film is fun, and would be a suitable choice for kids because it does not contain ""violence"" of ripping up monsters or knocking out poor Mojo Jojo. The most violent scene is its opening credit where three girls beat up the ""villains"" (as they did before the opening title appears in every episode). The story looks padded at times, with repetitious flying sequences, but overall it is OK though I still don't understand why the producers thought of pitting Girls against Princess, most annoying character in the series.But if you want some clever gags or wacky humor (like me), this special will be disappointing. I don't think PPG is intended solely for kids and actually its content is often meant for adult viewers. You don't find here the hilarious send-ups of the Beatles of ""Meet the Beat Alls"" or memorable new supporting characters (like Girls' new neighbor Robin with her funny one-liner), all of which are obviously aimed for adult audiences. There are some cultural references, and unlike the regular episodes the narration is recited in the style of ""Twas The Night Before Christmas"" with couplets, but not enough even for this comparatively short program.I think Santa would know everything about Powerpuff Girls if he is really Santa, and he wouldn't think they are really naughty; Princess would rather create her own chemical X using everything money can buy. The story is weak and full of plot holes, but all in all this is a decent film with the solid voice acting from the regular cast, enjoyable for the younger viewers and perhaps for some of the older ones.",3,OK for Younger Viewers,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,2014,"['Twas', 'Fight', 'Christmas', 'centers', 'plot', 'spoiled', 'Princess', 'who', 'Santa', 'giving', 'Christmas', 'present', 'only', 'coal', 'rest', 'children', 'world', 'including', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls', 'what', 'Princess', 'superpower', 'chemical', 'X', 'fly', 'hated', 'Buttercup', 'Bubbles', 'Blossom.Special', 'episode', 'PPG', 'nothing', 'special', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'still', 'film', 'fun', 'would', 'be', 'suitable', 'choice', 'kids', 'not', 'contain', 'violence', 'ripping', 'up', 'monsters', 'knocking', 'out', 'poor', 'Mojo', 'Jojo', 'most', 'violent', 'scene', 'opening', 'credit', 'where', 'three', 'girls', 'beat', 'up', 'villains', 'did', 'opening', 'title', 'episode', 'story', 'padded', 'times', 'repetitious', 'flying', 'sequences', 'overall', 'OK', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'producers', 'thought', 'pitting', 'Girls', 'Princess', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', 'series.But', 'want', 'clever', 'gags', 'wacky', 'humor', 'special', 'will', 'be', 'disappointing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'PPG', 'intended', 'solely', 'kids', 'actually', 'content', 'often', 'meant', 'adult', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'hilarious', 'send-ups', 'Beatles', 'Meet', 'Beat', 'Alls', 'memorable', 'new', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Girls', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Robin', 'funny', 'one-liner', 'are', 'obviously', 'aimed', 'adult', 'audiences', 'are', 'cultural', 'references', 'regular', 'narration', 'recited', 'style', 'Twas', 'Night', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'couplets', 'not', 'enough', 'even', 'comparatively', 'short', 'program.I', 'think', 'Santa', 'would', 'know', 'everything', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls', 'really', 'Santa', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'really', 'naughty', 'Princess', 'would', 'rather', 'create', 'own', 'chemical', 'X', 'using', 'everything', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'story', 'weak', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'decent', 'film', 'solid', 'voice', 'acting', 'regular', 'cast', 'enjoyable', 'younger', 'viewers', 'perhaps', 'older', 'ones']",N/A
