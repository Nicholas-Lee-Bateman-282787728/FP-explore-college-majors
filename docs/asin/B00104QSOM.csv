1124202,A2QGP7E8LSC7TG,B00104QSOM,,"[5, 6]","This paragraph will only mention the barebones nature of this two-disc set. It's not much and one can easily get by with the single-disc DVD edition. I would've loved to see more than just the production/research stills set to music. That would've made for an excellent companion to this movie.And what a movie it is: A character study of an empty shell of a man who is lacking anything resembling a conscience. The person is neither ""good"" nor ""bad"": Plainview is amoral. He doesn't care as long as he gets what he wants. And, even when he does succeed, it's never enough.The scene with his ""brother"" is where the murder isn't done out of any motive other than his ""brother"" was conning him. That is beautiful irony.The opening scenes details that as starkly as possible. Plainview doesn't even care about nearly dying in his mine out in the middle of nowhere. Despite having a badly mangled leg he literally drags himself to get his ore appraised. Everything and everyone, including himself, is simply a tool and nothing more. What's also interesting about the opening scenes is that for 14 minutes there is no dialogue.The attention to detail by longtime DP Robert Elswitt is impeccable. Sure there was a lot of research into oil drilling but it's Elswitt's photography that brings it all into striking focus. Death and injury is a part of the job as we see the pain up close. Even the drilling for oil as the drill bit breaks off and impales the bottom of the shaft as oil percolates up through the ""wound"" is seen as a symbolic bloodletting as oil is brought up to the surface and collected in pools above ground. Then it gets literal as the block and tackle rig collapses and caves in the skull of a man working with Plainview at the bottom with a red mist upon contact.It's with the death of the driller where Plainview appears to contain some shred of compassion for the driller's now-orphaned son. And even his adopted son is a part of Plainview's plans: A cute faade to hide his own amoral nature which is revealed in the next scene that contains the first lines of dialogue in the movie (Plainview's monologue in that scene is reproduced in full on one of the panels of the DVD packaging).On an unrelated note, how can one after watching ""Magnolia"" not see the parallel of the collapse of the pulley into a mine and not think of raining frogs?The ending of the movie may be considered a copout or something a bit more harrowing. Plainview's last two words of dialogue sum up the ending. It's here where viewers can be easily divided over the ending of the film. But then what other way would that be?Daniel Day Lewis as Plainview is a marvel to watch. Given the character he's as slick as they come in the oil biz. It's the kind of performance that drives this character study. From the mannerisms to his smoother-than-silk in pitching business towards naive landowners it's both a compelling performance to watch. And yet the character is as unsympathetic as they come.On the opposite end is Paul Dano playing two roles as twin brothers: The first offering Plainview offering him a prospect for oil to drill. The latter is an evangelical preacher. Dano does what he can with the former in all its naive innocence, Dano shines as the preacher who tries to win Plainview into his flock without realizing the empty void of amorality that Plainview epitomizes.Paul Tomas Anderson did a phenomenal job with this film. The human drama and tragedy in this film handily outshines ""Magnolia"". And while ""Magnolia"" tried its best to be upbeat in parts there is no such tropes to be found here. Everything is played straight without any sense of release; there's not even a smile at the end.Above everything else this is a rare film that's meant to be savored. Not many of those kinds of films are made today. Of all the films released by studios this is one worth spending the money and time for.",5,A harrowing look into amoral greed.,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,3898,"['paragraph', 'will', 'only', 'mention', 'barebones', 'nature', 'two-disc', 'set', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'single-disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'just', 'production/research', 'set', 'music', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'excellent', 'companion', 'movie.And', 'what', 'movie', 'character', 'study', 'empty', 'shell', 'man', 'who', 'lacking', 'anything', 'resembling', 'conscience', 'person', 'good', 'bad', 'Plainview', 'amoral', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'long', 'what', 'even', 'when', 'succeed', 'never', 'enough.The', 'scene', 'brother', 'where', 'murder', ""n't"", 'done', 'motive', 'other', 'brother', 'was', 'conning', 'beautiful', 'irony.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'details', 'as', 'starkly', 'possible', 'Plainview', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'nearly', 'dying', 'mine', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'having', 'badly', 'mangled', 'leg', 'literally', 'get', 'ore', 'appraised', 'Everything', 'everyone', 'including', 'simply', 'tool', 'nothing', 'more', 'What', 'also', 'interesting', 'opening', 'scenes', '14', 'minutes', 'dialogue.The', 'attention', 'detail', 'longtime', 'DP', 'Robert', 'Elswitt', 'impeccable', 'Sure', 'was', 'lot', 'research', 'oil', 'drilling', 'Elswitt', 'photography', 'striking', 'focus', 'Death', 'injury', 'part', 'job', 'see', 'pain', 'up', 'close', 'Even', 'drilling', 'oil', 'drill', 'bit', 'breaks', 'bottom', 'shaft', 'oil', 'up', 'wound', 'seen', 'symbolic', 'bloodletting', 'oil', 'brought', 'up', 'surface', 'collected', 'pools', 'ground', 'Then', 'literal', 'block', 'tackle', 'rig', 'collapses', 'caves', 'skull', 'man', 'working', 'Plainview', 'bottom', 'red', 'mist', 'contact.It', 'death', 'driller', 'where', 'Plainview', 'contain', 'shred', 'compassion', 'driller', 'now-orphaned', 'son', 'even', 'adopted', 'son', 'part', 'Plainview', 'plans', 'cute', 'faade', 'hide', 'own', 'amoral', 'nature', 'revealed', 'next', 'scene', 'first', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'Plainview', 'monologue', 'scene', 'reproduced', 'full', 'one', 'panels', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'unrelated', 'note', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'watching', 'Magnolia', 'not', 'see', 'parallel', 'collapse', 'pulley', 'mine', 'not', 'think', 'raining', 'frogs', 'ending', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'copout', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'harrowing', 'Plainview', 'last', 'two', 'words', 'dialogue', 'sum', 'ending', 'here', 'where', 'viewers', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'divided', 'ending', 'film', 'then', 'what', 'other', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Plainview', 'marvel', 'watch', 'Given', 'character', 'as', 'slick', 'come', 'oil', 'biz', 'kind', 'performance', 'character', 'study', 'mannerisms', 'smoother-than-silk', 'pitching', 'business', 'towards', 'naive', 'landowners', 'compelling', 'performance', 'watch', 'yet', 'character', 'as', 'unsympathetic', 'come.On', 'opposite', 'end', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'playing', 'two', 'roles', 'twin', 'brothers', 'first', 'offering', 'Plainview', 'offering', 'prospect', 'oil', 'drill', 'latter', 'evangelical', 'preacher', 'Dano', 'what', 'can', 'former', 'naive', 'innocence', 'Dano', 'preacher', 'who', 'win', 'Plainview', 'flock', 'realizing', 'empty', 'void', 'amorality', 'Plainview', 'epitomizes.Paul', 'Tomas', 'Anderson', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'film', 'human', 'drama', 'tragedy', 'film', 'handily', 'Magnolia', 'Magnolia', 'tried', 'best', 'be', 'upbeat', 'parts', 'such', 'tropes', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Everything', 'played', 'straight', 'sense', 'release', 'not', 'even', 'smile', 'end.Above', 'everything', 'else', 'rare', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'savored', 'Not', 'many', 'kinds', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'today', 'films', 'released', 'studios', 'one', 'worth', 'spending', 'money', 'time']",There Will Be Blood
1124203,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B00104QSOM,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[4, 5]","Actors can be divided up into two categories: Of coarse there are good actors. More interestingly, there are actors that are generally considered to be good, maybe really are good, and then the category in which Daniel Day-Lewis belongs.Indeed there is many a fine actor that has worked in the movies and are famous and loved for their great performances. Often these actors are always quite recognizable in whatever role, however different from the last, that we find them in. No doubt you can come up with your own very long list of these performers! I don't know that there is anything all that wrong with that. There is this much smaller group of performers out there that achieve what is actually the ultimate goal of their particular craft. These performers disappear into the role and what you see on the screen is only the character. Your attention goes to the character and to such an extent that you find yourself amazed that this is the same actor that you'd seen in previous roles.Daniel Day-Lewis actually reminds me of the great director Stanley Kubrick. They are masters of their art. You could at times not help but wish they'd give us more in terms of their output because they're just so damn good -- and by *good* I mean about as perfect as a person can be in doing what they do. You realize though, that your maybe getting a little greedy because when they worked they put *everything* they had into it. Kubrick is gone and we have to live with the fact that we'll not get anymore more Kubrick films. But in all probability we will see -albeit barely recognizably, Daniel Day-Lewis practicing his craft, taking the form of another  character.Watch MY LEFT FOOT, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, GANGS OF NEW YORK, THERE WILL BE BLOOD and tell me there is a better actor in the world now.",5,Shapeshifting Daniel Day-Lewis,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,1800,"['Actors', 'can', 'be', 'divided', 'up', 'two', 'categories', 'coarse', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'More', 'interestingly', 'are', 'actors', 'are', 'generally', 'considered', 'be', 'good', 'maybe', 'really', 'are', 'good', 'then', 'category', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'belongs.Indeed', 'many', 'fine', 'actor', 'worked', 'movies', 'are', 'famous', 'loved', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'are', 'always', 'quite', 'recognizable', 'role', 'however', 'different', 'last', 'find', 'doubt', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'very', 'long', 'list', 'performers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'wrong', 'much', 'smaller', 'group', 'performers', 'there', 'achieve', 'what', 'actually', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'particular', 'craft', 'performers', 'disappear', 'role', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'only', 'character', 'attention', 'character', 'extent', 'find', 'amazed', 'same', 'actor', ""'d"", 'seen', 'previous', 'roles.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'actually', 'great', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'are', 'masters', 'art', 'could', 'times', 'not', 'help', 'wish', ""'d"", 'give', 'more', 'terms', 'output', ""'re"", 'just', 'so', 'damn', 'good', '*good*', 'mean', 'as', 'perfect', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'realize', 'maybe', 'getting', 'little', 'greedy', 'when', 'worked', 'put', '*everything*', 'had', 'Kubrick', 'gone', 'have', 'live', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'not', 'get', 'anymore', 'more', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'probability', 'will', 'see', '-albeit', 'barely', 'recognizably', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'practicing', 'craft', 'taking', 'form', 'character.Watch', 'MY', 'LEFT', 'FOOT', 'THE', 'LAST', 'THE', 'MOHICANS', 'GANGS', 'OF', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'THERE', 'WILL', 'BE', 'BLOOD', 'tell', 'better', 'actor', 'world', 'now']",There Will Be Blood

Daniel Day Louis is excellent as the greedy and selfish Daniel Plainfield.  The movie is different than I expect by the fact that there was such a rivalary between greed and religion.I don't know who the character of the young religious healer was but I hated him from the spot.  He played an excellent roll because I could understand how he got under Daniel' skin.The realationship between Daniel and the boy and then his brother showed how he was nice to each one of them but when they did something against Daniel, Daniel got total revenge with no half measures.Daniel was never even interested in women because they were never as important as money.I like the fact that he was so independant and would not sell out to Standard Oil.  I thought he was going represent a big oil conclomerate as opposed to an indivual.  Which is why the movie worked so well because you had to wait and see who would get his sole.I like in the end that they showed who the charlaton really was and what he had to do to pay for it.Overall I think people who are independant will like this movie, it moves slow at first but it speeds up as it goes along.The extras on the DVD 2nd disk were interesting and stressed the conflict between religion and greed.",4,Greed is good,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,1335,"['was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'about', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Louis', 'excellent', 'greedy', 'selfish', 'Daniel', 'Plainfield', 'movie', 'different', 'expect', 'fact', 'was', 'such', 'rivalary', 'greed', 'religion.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'character', 'young', 'religious', 'healer', 'was', 'hated', 'spot', 'played', 'excellent', 'roll', 'could', 'understand', 'how', 'got', 'Daniel', 'skin.The', 'realationship', 'Daniel', 'boy', 'then', 'brother', 'showed', 'how', 'was', 'nice', 'one', 'when', 'did', 'something', 'Daniel', 'Daniel', 'got', 'total', 'revenge', 'half', 'measures.Daniel', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'interested', 'women', 'were', 'never', 'as', 'important', 'money.I', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'independant', 'would', 'not', 'sell', 'out', 'Standard', 'Oil', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'represent', 'big', 'oil', 'conclomerate', 'opposed', 'indivual', 'Which', 'why', 'movie', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'had', 'wait', 'see', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'sole.I', 'end', 'showed', 'who', 'charlaton', 'really', 'was', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'pay', 'it.Overall', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'independant', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'slow', 'first', 'up', 'along.The', 'extras', 'DVD', '2nd', 'disk', 'were', 'interesting', 'stressed', 'conflict', 'religion', 'greed']",There Will Be Blood

1124209,A3RWR50VUII07D,B00104QSOM,"All Red ""Red""","[10, 14]","""There Will be Blood"" was a mixed bag for me.  Sorry, but there are moments of greatness and there are just moments.I will not deny that some of the visual scenes captured by Bob Elswit are some of the most spectacular that are on film.  The oil drilling scenes are simply unparalleled- absolutely some of the best camera work that I have ever seen-VERY memorable.Jonny Greenwood's dissonant violins are used to great effect, as well as the pizzicato strings, the arpeggiated cello and the triumphant Brahm's Violin Concerto to fit the mood and the action of this film. This was an ideal soundtrack that propelled and energized the film, creating superb tension.My biggest problem is the screenplay by Paul Anderson.  The attempt is huge, but is so overly focused on Daniel Plainview ( I think the name speaks volumes) that Anderson's attempt to rival Plainview's greed and contemptible behavior with that of the other oilmen and of the opportunist preacher, Eli Sunday, causes the film to be very lopsided in over focusing on a character who refuses to speak about his past and is simply what you see ""in plain view"" like oil on top of the ground with the underbelly yet to be tapped. Though these characters were well acted, they never become any more than cardboard cut-outs with no heart  revealed.  These characters, even the oil-drillers and the church people have little to no affect in them. In the final scene in the bowling alley, there is a great explosion of temperament, but in the end what is revealed except what is ""in plain view.""I absolutely stuck with the film, though I personally felt that the film was very uneven overall.  The film began to unravel  at the 1928 point when H.W marries Mary and the scene shifts to the grand house where Plainview lives.  From that point, what had been a very well calculated film became rushed and ultimately sought to reveal motivation of the main characters which turned out to be nothing shocking at all.  Plainview and Sunday were never anymore than what you ever saw in the film from the very start-opportunists.  The ending???  Not my choice! I felt as though I had just seen the ending of ""The Sopranos"".  Where is Plainview going from here?: more despicable behavior? more greed? more need to be #1? more killing? more rage with no understanding of inner self?

1124213,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00104QSOM,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[0, 2]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***This movie solidifies Daniel Day-Lewis as the breakout actor of this decade. Always selective in his roles, he does the character of Daniel Plainview with such brilliant intensity, humor, love, hate, and subtlety that you never realize his character is changing as the movie progresses.The story is not at all highly dramatic and complex, following the simple story of Plainview's attempt to get at the vast ocean of oil beneath a small western village. The movie is primarily a character study, as Daniel takes up perhaps 90% of the movie.Paul Dano, as Eli Sunday, plays opposite Daniel not too often, but in such a social duel with one another that doesn't overwhelm or underwhelm. And you begin to notice throughout the movie that Eli becomes more and more like Daniel as the story progresses.The movie's focus on Daniel is done in such a way that the movie is about him, but not in a megalomaniacal way that he must be on screen at all times. Other characters shine around him, and play off of him to make their own characters that much more interesting.The music is highly unique, and definitely would break the movie if it were any different, or non-present at all.  It almost works like a silent movie if it were just the music and subtitles.  It could even work as a musical without singing.But the highest marks the movie gets, the most brilliant part of the film, the most frightening element of it, and the meaning behind my vaguely grotesque review title, is the fact that the character of Daniel Plainview is written and portrayed with such affection, reality, and depth, that he is very nearly a real person.  He could seem to be more real than many living people today.Daniel Day-Lewis knows and perfectly executes every emotion the character would experience, in such a way that even when he goes overboard, it's utterly believable that such a character would say such a thing, or do such a thing.  There are no gaps in personality or lapses in logic.  From the beginning, you are frightened by how utterly real a person he is, and how utterly good-natured, kind-hearted, and human he is!  Even as he sets about his work, his primary concerns are less with making money and more with making sure his workers are provided for, the town (Little Boston) provided for, and everyone working happily at full capacity.Even as he slowly becomes insane, he retains aspects of humanity, as he sobs mournfully for his lost brother after learning the truth and killing the imposter Henry Plainview.  He even sobs, and drinks himself to sleep after confronting his son (at the end, when he's grown up), revealing he was an orphan he took care of after his father died, and severing all ties to him.  He does all he can for HW after the boy loses his hearing, and keeps careful tabs on him when he's sent away to a school for the deaf, constantly questioning Fletcher Hamilton about his accomodations.The nomination and subsequent winning of Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis, after watching this performance, is absolutely no contest.

In it, we see the corruption of capitalism and its bizarre relationship with religion.  Both are portrayed as two sides of the same coin.Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Daniel Plainview, an obsessive oil man who brooks no opposition to his ways.  His chief protagonist is Paul Dano as Eli Sunday, an old fashioned fire and brimstone preacher.  These two are the central players in a story told against a backdrop of the California oil rush in the early twentieth century.A strong case can be made for Day-Lewis to win an Oscar as best actor.  He is absolutely overpowering in this film.  He is a true master.  Yet for all his hard work, the film itself can be ponderous at times.  The story sometimes dawdles with long sequences without dialogue as scenes are slowly set.  If only the film could be tightened up to some degree.  The broader panorama of the film is magnificent.The film's concluding scene is a highlight.  It is here that the viewer is a witness to the depth of the corruption that is only hinted at elsewhere.  Yet, this scene is also one not for the faint hearted.

1124215,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00104QSOM,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","There comes a point when even a great film can be over-hyped; when even a marvel of cinema, a masterpiece if you will, will get so much attention and accolades that it becomes `that movie that failed to live up'.  On the outset, while watching `There Will Be Blood' you could come to believe that to be true of this film.  Heralded as PT Anderson's finest film to date and regarded as one of the two cinematic masterpieces of this year past, `There Will Be Blood' has an obligation to deliver.  What is sad is that many people are not aware of exactly what it plans to deliver.  I can see now how backlash can begin, but I'm here to say that `backlash' in this case is undoubtedly undeserved.Paul Thomas Anderson's epic masterpiece (there, I said it) `There Will Be Blood' is not the movie many may believe it to be.  It is a slow and conflicted journey through the desperations and frustrations placed upon us by greed and selfishness.  It exposes the similarities between materialism and religious self-righteousness and it proves that nothing good can come of evil.`There Will Be Blood' is loosely based of off Upton Sinclair's novel `Oil!' but truly it serves as Anderson's very own vision.  Anderson pits oilman Daniel Plainview against religious preacher Eli Sunday in a small town of Little Boston during the turn of the century.  Plainview is a greedy man, a selfish man who will do anything he can to get what he wants, but Sunday is not much different.  Sunday is a man consumed with a fire that matches the determination of Plainview himself.  They are a perfect match; thus they are perfect enemies.The film moves at a slow pace, taking it's time to build and flesh out these characters.  Aside from Plainview and Sunday you have Daniel's son, H.W., a young yet oddly mature boy who takes in much more than one would expect.  As his fathers `business partner', young H.W. stands comfortably at his father's side; a sight that is often as chilling as it is heartbreaking.`There Will Be Blood' is a film that opens with such a savage calm, a feeling of unsettled tranquility.  The score blazing in the distance, Plainview mining for gold; not a word spoken and yet so much is being said.  It ends on a completely different note; one of tranquil savagery; a burst of manic violence that leaves the viewer feeling oddly subdued.  It's such a masterful way to open and close a film; opening in such a way that keeps us on edge and closing in such a way that puts us at ease.Yet another reason why PT Anderson should have won that directing Oscar.The film is masterfully crafted; a film that just fits so beautifully together, each facet connecting nicely with the next.  It's beautifully shot; the Oscar winning cinematography is spellbinding to say the least.  The score is also a huge plus here, lending a helping hand in creating the perfect mood for this piece.  I remember falling in love with Greenwood's score when I first heard it, but hearing it within the confines of this film adds a whole new light to its grace and beauty.And then there is the acting...Much credit has been given to Daniel Day-Lewis for his performance as Daniel Plainview.  He's won just about every award imaginable and has received countless amounts of praise and admiration, for which he has received it with the utmost sincerity and gratitude.  I am here to acknowledge once again his magnificence here.  Day-Lewis completely becomes Daniel Plainview.  He doesn't look like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't sound like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't act like Daniel Day-Lewis.  Daniel Day-Lewis does not exist within this character; only Daniel Plainview is present.  He flawlessly boils to the surface this mans flaws and transgressions, his bolstering greed and domination.  There are moments when you know that this man is thinking the worst and yet all we see is that sly grin and his eyes, those eyes that speak volumes.  This is not just one of the finest performances of the year, but perhaps in the history of cinema.Daniel is not without good company though.  There are two other performers here that steal scenes and command attention.  Young Dillon Freasier, who plays H.W., delivers a brilliant performance.  He masterfully creates and otherworldly maturity that chills the bones while speaking barely a word.  Pay close attention to the relationship between father and son; there are volumes to be told.  Of course we have Paul Dano who plays the eccentric Eli Sunday.  His performance is mind-bogglingly good.  There is a scene where he proceeds to expel the arthritis from the hands of one of the members of his church.  It's the first scene where we really get a glimpse into this very complex character.  It's brilliant to say the least and it serves as a masterful building block for what is to come.`There Will Be Blood' is a film that everyone should see.  Everyone should know what they are about to witness first; that way they can really embrace it for what it is.  This is not an action film, nor a thriller in your most conventional sense.  `There Will Be Blood' is quite frankly one of the best character studies I've seen in recent years.  It's a film that flawlessly exposes the inhumanity within humanity and forces the audience to accept the `ugly' within our souls.  As many have noted; this is not a film that wants to be liked.  It will not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside, but it will leave you with much to ponder, much to think about and contemplate and will thus leave you with much to remember.",5,"Drink up;

Paul Dano did well as Eli Sunday, and he was so creepy and perfect for his part. Ciaran Hinds also has a supporting role, and I was so happy to see him again. He's one of my favorite actors. The movie wasn't slow-going, but it was slow in the beginning. It spanned several years in the early 20th century when everyone was on the quest for oil. I liked the story of the two main characters striving for wealth and power by the same means but for two very different goals. It was interesting to watch this movie develop and ""finish""...

I won't go through the story-line because others have done a good job on that. And yes the cinematography is beautiful. But I have two problems with this film. Firstly, the story itself. OK, two rival characters each tormented by their own obsessions set in an epic historical background. But so what? We've seen that stuff so many times before. It's what Hollywood's about. Which makes it too self-consciously an attempt at 'greatness.' And that's where it goes wrong. Foreign films don't make this mistake the way we do in America. They convey a message and then let the viewer decide whether the movie's great. It's like we're constantly being reminded ""this is a great movie, guys."" Secondly, I have a problem with Day Lewis himself and found the preacher more convincing. Day Lewis is too perfect. He's such a competent method actor that I found myself wondering - maybe one day we can programme a robot to act perfectly and we won't need actors. Like Meryl Streep. For me when you see a truly great actor perform not only must they be competent but they must seem human. Bogart plays hundreds of different characters convincingly but you somehow can see Bogart's soul shining through as well as the soul of the characters he acts. Day Lewis is a great vehicle but who is Day Lewis himself? Having seen many films of his I still don't know.

1124221,ARA48345JZPZR,B00104QSOM,Archmaker,"[1, 2]","Intense, shrewd and ultimately crazed not only applies to Daniel Plainview, the wily exploiter of resources, both mineral and human, who is brought to living, breathing, complex life by Daniel Day Lewis, but in some ways also to this weird and idiosyncratic film that is its own crazy testament to the collaboration of two brilliant, obsessive filmmakers, the aforementioned Mr. Day Lewis and the equally passionate Paul Thomas Anderson.The film touches on two major threads of, especially American, life: entrepreneurial commerce and fundamental religion, that in their benign forms have contributed to the energy and elevation of American history and life, but in their more deranged incarnations have brought untold misery and tragedy. Here we see the passion and drive produced by both and how these passions can be manipulated and directed and how wielding and bending these powerful forces can ultimately warp and pervert the manipulators themselves.  Absolute power, ya know?Lewis's Daniel Plainview lives for one thing only, the capture and exploitation of oil.  It is turn-of-the-century America, and a man with guts and drive and shrewd savvy can create his own wealth and empire, if he has the daring and nerve.  Plainview has all of that and a corresponding amorality and misanthrope that allows him free rein to do whatever he deems necessary.  He will use any means or person to achieve his end, and we come to see that the end isn't the acquiring of wealth, it is the ""acquiring"" itself.  It is the ""using"" of the land and the people on it, it is the exploitation of human and mineral resources that is his ultimate satisfaction, if such a restless and disdainful spirit can ever truly know satisfaction, peace, or any form of recognizable human happiness.Daniel Day Lewis's Plainview is a complex and astonishing portrayal.  His speech cadences bear a subtle and eerie similarity, without being derivative, to the late John Huston's, and this created, for me, a haunting resonance of Plainview as a younger version of the complete, total, and very human monster that was Huston's Noah Cross in Chinatown, another entrepreneurial magnate whose amorality allowed him to be ""capable of anything"".Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is first rate, and his bravado in creating such an eccentric film of a strange and compelling era in American history, little thought of nor reflected upon in our times, and yet the source of many of the wonderful and awful themes still playing themselves out in American life today, fulfills a promise made by a man willing to climax a film about modern Southern California with a Biblical rain of frogs.  Anderson has the daring and the passion and he has found the perfect match for his material in his lead actor.  The supporting cast, crew and crafts have all likewise done their work well.It is not a perfect film, it's a tad long and has its diversions and occasional sidetracks, and the ending seems a bit contrived, but only a little.  We must see that in the end Plainview's ruthless grip is a grasp upon nothing more than his own vanity and the final emptiness of avarice.  He is ""finished"".  Well worthwhile for those willing to let the film play out in its own way, and it has at its core an unforgettable, complex and mesmerizing central character and performance.",4,"Intense, shrewd, and ultimately crazed........",1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,3320,"['Intense', 'shrewd', 'ultimately', 'crazed', 'not', 'only', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'wily', 'exploiter', 'resources', 'mineral', 'human', 'who', 'brought', 'living', 'breathing', 'complex', 'life', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'ways', 'also', 'weird', 'idiosyncratic', 'film', 'own', 'crazy', 'testament', 'collaboration', 'two', 'brilliant', 'obsessive', 'filmmakers', 'aforementioned', 'Mr.', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'equally', 'passionate', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson.The', 'film', 'touches', 'two', 'major', 'threads', 'especially', 'American', 'life', 'entrepreneurial', 'commerce', 'fundamental', 'religion', 'benign', 'forms', 'have', 'contributed', 'energy', 'elevation', 'American', 'history', 'life', 'more', 'deranged', 'incarnations', 'have', 'brought', 'untold', 'misery', 'tragedy', 'Here', 'see', 'passion', 'drive', 'produced', 'how', 'passions', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'directed', 'how', 'wielding', 'bending', 'powerful', 'forces', 'can', 'ultimately', 'warp', 'pervert', 'manipulators', 'Absolute', 'power', 'ya', 'know', 'Lewis', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'one', 'thing', 'only', 'capture', 'exploitation', 'oil', 'turn-of-the-century', 'America', 'man', 'guts', 'drive', 'shrewd', 'savvy', 'can', 'create', 'own', 'wealth', 'empire', 'daring', 'nerve', 'Plainview', 'corresponding', 'amorality', 'misanthrope', 'free', 'rein', 'do', 'whatever', 'necessary', 'will', 'use', 'means', 'person', 'achieve', 'end', 'come', 'see', 'end', ""n't"", 'acquiring', 'wealth', 'acquiring', 'using', 'land', 'people', 'exploitation', 'human', 'mineral', 'resources', 'ultimate', 'satisfaction', 'restless', 'disdainful', 'spirit', 'can', 'ever', 'truly', 'know', 'satisfaction', 'peace', 'form', 'recognizable', 'human', 'happiness.Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Plainview', 'complex', 'astonishing', 'portrayal', 'speech', 'cadences', 'bear', 'subtle', 'eerie', 'similarity', 'being', 'derivative', 'late', 'John', 'Huston', 'created', 'haunting', 'resonance', 'Plainview', 'younger', 'version', 'complete', 'total', 'very', 'human', 'monster', 'was', 'Huston', 'Noah', 'Cross', 'Chinatown', 'entrepreneurial', 'magnate', 'amorality', 'allowed', 'be', 'capable', 'anything', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'direction', 'first', 'rate', 'bravado', 'creating', 'such', 'eccentric', 'film', 'strange', 'compelling', 'era', 'American', 'history', 'little', 'thought', 'reflected', 'times', 'yet', 'source', 'many', 'wonderful', 'awful', 'themes', 'still', 'playing', 'out', 'American', 'life', 'today', 'promise', 'made', 'man', 'willing', 'climax', 'film', 'modern', 'Southern', 'California', 'Biblical', 'rain', 'frogs', 'Anderson', 'daring', 'passion', 'found', 'perfect', 'match', 'material', 'lead', 'actor', 'supporting', 'cast', 'crew', 'crafts', 'have', 'likewise', 'done', 'work', 'well.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'tad', 'long', 'diversions', 'occasional', 'sidetracks', 'ending', 'bit', 'contrived', 'only', 'little', 'must', 'see', 'end', 'Plainview', 'ruthless', 'grip', 'grasp', 'nothing', 'more', 'own', 'vanity', 'final', 'emptiness', 'avarice', 'finished', 'Well', 'willing', 'let', 'film', 'play', 'out', 'own', 'way', 'core', 'unforgettable', 'complex', 'mesmerizing', 'central', 'character', 'performance']",There Will Be Blood
1124222,ABALLVO1U2DTJ,B00104QSOM,a reader,"[10, 42]","I can't say how much I hated this movie.  The main reasons are:1) It depicts Christianity in a very evil and slanderous way.  A major element of this film is a young ""preacher"" and a ""church"" which the local people are very committed to.  The preacher and the church were  cartoonish in their evil, bizarre and kooky beliefs, and in their mean behavior.2) The central character is a rotten man.  He is an industrious and, in many ways, successful businessman.  However, he hates people in general, is murderous, and full of selfish ambition.  He appears to be a socialist's cartoonish view of ""greedy"" capitalism.3) The ""music"" was very grating and annoying, for quite a bit of the movie.  This noise is akin to fingernails on a blackboard.  It seemed intentional, to create an uneasy mood.  However, it was just very unpleasant--not something I want to hear in my living room.4) There was very little depicted in the movie that was noble, uplifting, encouraging, or virtuous.Overall, I thought this movie was evil and useless nihilism.

1124223,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B00104QSOM,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 1]","I first saw There Will Be Blood without knowing anything about the plot or who was in it. I'm kind of glad I did it that way now, because nearly every review you read has people on one of two sides: that it's pure genius and one of the best movies of all time, or that it's boring and nothing happens. I can totally see where the bored crowd is coming from, since this really is a movie where nothing really happens. It's more of a character study than it is of anything else, despite what plot summaries may lead you to believe. As for it being one of the best movies ever made...I can't quite say that, though it definitely is in my personal top 10.Daniel Plainview is running an oil business. Oil and money are the main things that make him live. He has a son of sorts (a baby he took in from an employee who was killed on the job) named H.W., and together they go around getting the trust of towns to let Daniel drill on their land. When he starts to really get things going, he encounters a bit of a road block- a young boy named Eli who's the definition of 'crazy Christian', who can see Daniel for who he is, and also wants in on the money.That's the basic plot summary, but the majority of this movie revolves around Daniel and showing just how far he'll go to get what he wants. Murdering people isn't a big deal as long as it means making more money, and he even goes so far as to get baptised in Eli's church to win over one man who wouldn't let Daniel drill in his area unless he joined the church. As the movie continues, Daniel essentially snaps and becomes consumed by his hatred. THAT'S what the movie's really about. Eli's in the movie for a good while, but not even half of the run time when it comes down to it. Personally, even with this movie being as long as it is, with 'nothing happening' since it's very dialogue driven, I loved it. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance I've ever seen in a movie, and I'll never forget the name of Daniel Plainview. Even people I know who were bored out of their minds watching this remember the character's name because he did that great of a job with the character. Paul Dano does excellent as well, making you hate him whenever he opens his mouth, and especially when he tries to be seen as a prophet.There are many long shots where the camera will just pan around or very, very slowly zoom in, and the first 15-20 minutes of the movie is sure to test anyone's patience if they're a casual movie watcher. Don't think I'm one of those artsy movie buffs, I can't stand those types, and I won't call the director a genius, but the fact that I wasn't bored for a second while watching this really says something, where I'm the kind of person who wants story progression at a steady pace and no slow spots. If you're looking for action, this movie doesn't have much aside from an incredible fire scene, some people getting shot, a short fight and of course the final scene that even people who haven't seen the movie know about. I also have to give credit to Johnny Greenwood for providing the film's score. For a period piece, there's a lot of experimental music, and his track titled Convergence was used flawlessly here. If I had to say anything bad about the movie, it's that I would've liked some more closure on things, mostly because so many people argue if the ending was a dream, in Daniel's head or real.For the blu-ray, this is a standard release, matching the quality of the dvd in every aspect, but slightly better for obvious reasons. So I won't waste time there, but things do look and sound good. Audio is in English, Spanish and French, as are the subtitles if you need them. The special features are all the same as those on the special edition 2 disc dvd set. You get the pictures and research featurette for the making of the movie, the trailers, the Fishing bit, the haircut and interrupted hymn deleted scene, and the Dailies Gone Wild feature. Finally, there's the History of Petroleum short film, made in the 1920s, and eventhough it seems a little out of place here, it's worth a watch, especially since they did such a good job of cleaning up the picture quality for it. The main complaint anyone who cares for special features is that there's no commentary track. I hear Paul Thomas Anderson isn't big on those, and I can respect that. But for everyone whining about the ending, I'd appreciate it if he would just come out and confirm the ending so it can be put to rest. I don't think he'd be one of those 'every movie should be like Fight Club' kind of people.I doubt a special edition or anniversary set will come out for this movie with the commentary track that everyone wants, so as it is, this blu-ray gets a 3 out of 5 from me. But the movie- the most important thing, gets a 5. Just know what you're getting into before you rent or buy it. This is a character study, plain and simple. But it's a damn good one with one of the finest performances ever, and Daniel Day-Lewis earned every bit of that Best Actor award for his portrayal as Daniel Plainview.",5,"I get bored easily, and I

1124225,A6JJ7CD3RN1W5,B00104QSOM,a writer,"[1, 3]","""There Will Be Blood"" is one of those dark, disturbing and insistent stories that compels you to watch, even when you'd rather turn away to a sunnier subject. It reminds me of ""Chinatown"" with its unsentimental view of the past and sinister subtexts. It's more than a story of greed and commerce in expanding late 19th century America; it traces a man's ambition to get whatever he wants at whatever cost.Such a universal theme is usually to be found in Shakespeare, and requires an actor with enough emotional heft to pull it off. Daniel Day Lewis is as hard as stone in the role of Daniel Plainview, the driven oil prospector who sacrifices everything on his way up (or is it down?).The film has a number of scenes that show how far Plainview will go to achieve his dream, but the one that clinched it for me was the oil derrick fire, drawn out in an almost agonizing pace by the director and stoked up by a mesmerizing score. Plainview and his crew, having unplugged an underground cache of oil, scramble to contain a flare-up that threatens to destroy both men and machinery. The scene starts at dusk, and as night falls, the combination of flames and inky black sky heighten the drama. With very little dialogue, the actors play out a modern myth: Prometheus bringing down the sacred fire. It's a chilling scene when Plainview, staring out of oil-streaked eyes at the derrick, mutters to his assistant that the rig is OK, but that his son (injured in the initial explosion), isn't. You can see the calculations that Plainview makes throughout his career that eventually catch up with him.There's so much in the way of film surprises that it would be best to see it for oneself.

He does a great job creating the character that in many ways is very similar to the Butcher character he played in Gangs of New York. However, setting the great acting aside this movie sucked. It was one of those movies i came into expecting to love but ended up hating. I sat through it once and I will not ever set through it again. It was long boring and pretentious. The movie was well acted by all involved but a well acted movie without a true storyline makes it a very unwatchable film. Its a mess from beginning to end. As such i cannot recommend it to anyone out there. I know for some reason a lot of people love this movie but for regular ""joe American"" this movie will be a borefest. I actually like artsy movies but this one was too much of nothing for me to like it. Not to mention i hated all the characters in it except for maybe Plainview's adopted son and his bit part didn't help out the movie in the least. So there you go.

1124227,A1N134HXXST079,B00104QSOM,"Baking Enthusiast ""Liza""","[2, 4]","What is director Paul Thomas Anderson saying with this film?  ""There Will Be Blood"" has been likened to ""Citizen Kane"" often enough that I initially wondered if the parodying of publishing magnate, Wm Randolph Hearst, in Kane had been revisited here in the form of TWBB's main character, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), as an oil tycoon.  Already fierecely debated in this forum, I can only add that what I took away from this film are no more than (a) the battle to death of two men--a misanthrope obsessed with oil who clings to the maxim ""trust no one,"" and an equally ambitious and crafty bogus preacher, and (b) the corrosive effects and systemic rot of extreme ambition above all else, both in capitalistic and evangelical pursuits.(The story has been synopsized many times already so I'll just limit my post to my opinions of the film.)(1)  Actors - Great performances by Daniel Day Lewis as lead and Paul Dano as Eli Sunday.  Lewis' portrayal of the megalomaniacal Plainview is outstanding--the avarice, the obsession, the greed all come across with ferociousness.  Dano is not to be upstaged as he portrays the histrionics of a bible-thumper, at times lucidly cunning and other times insanely possessed of the same evils he purports to banish.  The best scenes in this film are those with both as they humiliate each other at turns.(2)  Screenplay - Its story is mistakenly attributed to Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!.""  TWBB was only inspired by it.  At first depicting the entrepreneurial spirit and guts of the early 1900s, it then focuses its lenses on the price that is inevitably paid along the way to a  success that's measured in money and power.  Plainview wants to build an oil empire; Sunday wants to build an evangelical empire.  Someone has to pay for all this empire-building.  Both destroy each other and themselves in the end.Of particular note is the screenwriter's (Anderson) ability to tell an incredible story within a believable context.  Plainview and Sunday are both bigger than life (they're meant to be), but at no time did I find it a stretch to believe that such characters would behave in the manner that they do.Much has been made of the ending when Plainview uses the analogy of a milkshake in taunting his foe, Sunday, with the fact that he already owns the underground riches (oil drainage, he says) of a tract Sunday is proposing to broker on Plainview's behalf, with monetary compensation of course: ""I drink your milkshake.  I drink your water.  Everyday I drink the blood of the Lamb...""  Many thought it ridiculous and it has actually turned into a joke associated with the film.  Fact is, Anderson got the idea from a 1924 congressional hearing transcript (from the Teapot Dome Scandal, the contextual basis of Upton Sinclair's novel) where a senator describes oil drainage as:  ""Sir, if you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake and my straw reaches across the room, I'll end up drinking your milkshake.""  It's meant simply to illustrate that Plainview's finger is in every oil pot and he knows it, and Sunday's religious fervor has, and always has been, useless in impeding Plainview.(3)  Editing - Regarded as an epic by some (drivel by others), the film is over 2 hours in length.  Its length does not bother me.  Insatiable ambition, greed, oil, faith, industry, murder, revenge, fraud--many themes incorporated into one big picture so, if it takes 2  hours to effectively depict them, then that's what it takes.  In reviewing the scenes while fresh in my mind, I cannot think of any one scene that should have been cut.  Every single one, I believe, contributed to the understanding of the story and its main characters.(4)  Cinematography - The spectacle of oil rigs, derricks, gas explosions and such were unexpected.  (I mean, really, how exciting can an oil rig be?).  Shots of gushers, rigs aflame, mud, dirt, etc. were so artistically done that one can almost feel the slickness of the oil and the acrid smell as it burns, and heighten the dangers that surround such enterprises.  Wide panoramic shots of the rugged, dry land of Southern California were dazzling, its landscape broken by silhouettes of derricks and oil rigs, and once in a great while, swaths of brilliant blue water amidst the greys and black.  If there is an inconographic representation of California's oil boom, I'd have to say it would be this sort of shot.  Close-ups of the actors, filthy most times, unkempt, faces and limbs bronzed by outdoor labor, added to the realism.  Dirty fingernails, sweat pouring from their bodies, drenched in the oil that would make them rich, dust and mud beneath their feet--all were astoundingly photographed, down to the grease that rings their collars.  Technically, it's inarguably a superior film.It's a rough, rugged, hardscabble world here with characters that cannot or will not exorcise the malignancy that has taken root in themseleves.  It's a bold and visceral film that's well worth the lengthy view.",5,The bottomless pit of greed,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,4978,"['What', 'director', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'saying',

This is good stuff. The storyline surrounding his son is pretty good too.A good portion of the beginning is oddly quiet with eerie violin strings playing for several minutes, making it appear like a good horror film is about to kick in... but no, it's not anything like a horror film.  In fact for a while I was wondering if anybody would actually SPEAK!Actually the violins are REALLY good throughout the movie, always giving you the feeling something ominous is about to take place such as a brutal killing scene or one of the characters completely snapping suddenly... no, doesn't ever happen.And where's the BLOOD?

The actor, Paul Dano, was previously unknown to me, but he did a fine job portraying the Sunday brothers here. There Will Be Blood may not be faithful to Upton Sinclair's original story but it is a compelling portrait of evil in this world. I always laugh at those who think human beings are more good than evil. I have never seen any evidence for this being true in the course of my life.

1124231,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B00104QSOM,Bill Garrison,"[4, 11]","THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a perfect example of the disconnect of Hollywood and its version of a ""good"" movie and what the American public will pay to go see. This movie was nominated for several awards, including best picture, and Daniel Day Lewis picked up the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Plainview is an oil man. He's an independant oil man and very persuasive at getting land owners to let him drill on their land. Plainview gets word of a town that has tons of oil, and he heads there with his young son. Plainview convinces the town to let him drill on their land, and promises new roads and schools and much wealth for the people.This movie is all about Daniel Plainview, his son, and the person he truly is. As the movie progresses, Daniel Plainview doesn't change, he just reveals what kind of person he is. The movie is based on the novel OIL, by socialist Upton Sinclair, yet the movie contains no political message against big oil or big business. Plainview's primary adversary in the movie is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a pastor of a small church in the town. While the church's beliefs are anything but mainstream, the movie has really nothing to say about religion.This is a movie made in Hollywood for Hollywood. I'll admit I enjoyed Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview. In the film, Plainview looked exactly like a 1980s Tom Selleck. I also enjoyed the scenery and early 20th centurey setting. For the first twenty minutes of the movie, there is no dialogue. This is very unrealistic and shows that the filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson is trying to take the viewers out of the movie and notice the director.This is a well made movie with a good performance by Lewis. But it is also an overlong character study of a despicable man. I can see why this movie won awards, and I can also see why it was a box office failure.

1124233,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00104QSOM,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 5]","Similar to the filmCast Awayin which Tom Hanks carries the entire production, THERE WILL BE BLOOD has that same air due to the phenomenal performance by Daniel Day-Lewis ...with one big exception. Hanks was alone, so there really was no other supporting cast to compare him against while on his little island (unless you count the volleyball, `Wilson'). Daniel Day-Lewis was surrounded by a fine cast, but he outshone everyone of them by leagues.Not surprising, Day-Lewis won every acting award in every awards ceremony in 2007 (from the Oscars on down).More of a story about greed, There Will Be Blood is also a battle of wills: one with god-fearing faith and the other without. The faithful is represented by a fire-breathing preacher named Eli Sunday (Paul Dano,Little Miss Sunshine). Apparently an identical twin, Eli's brother Paul finds the successful oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and offers up his family's ranch in California as a place where ""oil runs on the surface of the ground."" Daniel and his `son' head onto the ranch and discover that there is, indeed, a lot of oil to be had. Making an initial promise to Eli that they'll ""build a new church"" for the local congregation, Daniel sets to work buying up all the surrounding property and dropping his first rig into the ground. Problems quickly arise with Eli, however, who has his own form of greed: the greed of religion. Wanting his money to build his church, Eli inserts himself into Daniel's business and the two quickly bump heads. Bad things begin happening around the new oil derrick: a well-man dies, an explosion and fire, and the sudden head injury of Daniel's son, H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier).The greed of Daniel Plainview knows no bounds, and the internal corruption that it causes is eked out in terrible portions. When Daniel put his son on a train and abandons him, we see that there's much more beneath the surface of this fractured man. Morality isn't something he's familiar with. Eli quickly zeroes in on this and all but forces Daniel to be baptized and saved in order to continue his successful drilling of the area. This is something that will come back and haunt both Eli and Daniel at the end of the film.Again, it is the awe-invoking performance by Day-Lewis that carries the film throughout its 158 minute length. The other actors do fine jobs, no doubt about it, but they pale in comparison to Day-Lewis' John Huston inspired performance (his voice was impeccable).This is a pretty dark film with not-just-a-few allusions that lean toward biblical text (many of the character names are taken straight from the bible, including Abel, Mary, Daniel, and Eli). The allusions go deeper than simple names, however, and watching There Will Be Blood one can't help but see them. The great part about this is that the ending doesn't wind up where you think it should. Forget redemption. You'll know how harsh Daniel Plainview's life has become when you hear him say, ""I'm finished.""

Anderson has created a moumental but flawed film about one man's ambition as it comes into conflict with the concept of faith. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil!, There Will Be Blood tells the story of independant oilman Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) as he struggles to get rich in turn of the century America.Day-Lewis,channeling John Huston, gives a career defining performance as a man totally alone in his ambition to become rich. This film is a character study more than an action narrative. Daniel Plainview is a complex man with no friends, no sense of history and presumably no morals as he attempts to control his destiny in the growing oil business. When he comes into conflict with an evangelical preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) true colors are shown and a fight to the finish is begun.The performance by Day-Lewis won him a deserved Best Actor Oscar. Also of note is the great camara work by Richard Elswit and the unique musical score by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead.I viewed the two disc edition which features the film on disc one and special features on the second disc. The special features include 15 minutes of stills and research to a Greenwood score, two trailers and some deleted scenes. These extras run for about 30 minutes. The main feature here is The History of Petroleum (1923-27) a silent black and white film produced by Sinclair Oil and the US Bureau of Mines. This short is also scored by Greenwood.This film is definately worth checking out but may be a better rental than purchase. One further note the packaging on this set is horrible.

I absolutely loved it. From the moment it began till the moment it ended I was having the time of my life. I was fully and wholly engaged, emotionally moved, shocked, challenged, and thrilled.There Will Be Blood is about this nation and the people who inhabit it. It is also about the origin of this nation, it's core values, morals, and the stuff that drives us...money and more simply greed. Religion and capitalism are exhibited at their most base and corrupt forms in this film. The empty vessel of the business man and the phony preacher. Each drives the other further away from any happy medium of honest business or any real search for spirituality. As a result of this power play Plainview's view of a religion as a sham are confirmed. Ultimately money and greed win out in the end but with not much to show for it.The one thing this film illustrates perfectly that most money hungry business types never seem to get that money in and of itself will do nothing for your life unless you have something that you want to do. Gathering up more and more money and growing richer and richer while destroying everyone around you will never amount to anything and ultimately your soul will be far more derelict than that of a simple common man. Of course this film is not about common men. The men in this film are examples of extraordinary men, each with drive and power lust of a different kind. The common men in the film are literally and figuratively beaten. Money and the power it brings are atop this pyramid in this film. The anger and beatings and sacrifices trickle downward. Each man exerting his authority over the one below him on the scale. Even Plainview's son exhibits his grasp for power with the fire he sets and then at the end his defiance of being controlled by the very man who made him. His loss of hearing was symbolic and could be interpreted as an unconscious desire in the boy to not listen to the words and desires of the father, thus escaping becoming the father.The film shows a story and we sit and watch it unfold.  That is just the surface. The film is full of symbolism, metaphors and subtext. On a very simple level it's greed vs righteousness or ambition vs deception. Daniel and Eli are opposite sides of the same coin. In the end Plainview wins but is still lost. he is also, as he says, ""finished"" because without his doppelg&auml;nger there anymore to drive him, he has nothing left to do. This aspect of his personality is evident earlier in the film when he is offered a million dollars for his oil. He declines due to silly syntactical technicalities in the offer he is given because Plainview needs to constantly push forward and barrel roll over everything and everyone in order to exist. In the end, after he has driven his son away, squashed the competition, and killed Eli he has fulfilled his life's purpose and the film ends. Plainview can also be seen as representation of this country.As a country we act and behave much in the same way Plainview does. And often times with no real sense as to why the things being done by this country are being done at all. It's a hidden nasty drive that pushes this economy forward and drives us as consumers. Now while this theory may be a stretch for some I still think at least aspects of this are alluded to by the film. The disregard for the land, the kid in a small box who is ultimately exposed as a mere business commodity, the quick and sudden deaths of men who are expendable, women who are barely seen or who do little or nothing, and ultimately the oil. All this speaks volumes for where we are as a country today. The fact that we are still bound to oil as a commodity  is no coincidence. That is what this film is about.

1124244,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00104QSOM,C. B Collins Jr.,"[7, 10]","This is an exceptional film that explores America's unique obsessions with driving ambitious industry and evangelical religion. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, Oil, the film is a stand alone excellent product that is independent of the novel. The complex subject matter can be explored because of the film's narrative structure that is chronological and straight forward story telling as well as the exceptional acting demonstrated by all the main characters. The film may be interpreted as fascinating character study and it may also be interpreted as an exploration of the darker side of capitalism encountering the darker side of evangelism.The film begins in 1898 with scenes of Daniel Plainview, a silver miner, discovering silver and simultaneously breaking his leg through a nasty fall down a mine shaft. We see this man literally crawl to stake his claim before he discovers oil in his second attempt at exploration. Gradually this man hires a crew and begins a series of discoveries of oil until in 1902 an accident kills a driller and Daniel informally adopts the orphaned child HW as his son. In 1911 Plainview and his business associate are approached by a California sheep herder, Paul Sunday, who reveals for a small payment where oil can be found on his family farm. Daniel and his adopted son act like hunters and visit the Sunday farm and find the claims are true. From this point a struggle begins between Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, the charismatic evangelical preaching son in the Sunday family. This tension builds as the Sunday family is pushed into the sidelines as Plainview's wealth and dominance builds. Multiple dramatic episodes unfold as a derrick explosion and fire leave young HW deaf. A long lost younger brother of Daniel appears only to eventually be revealed to be less than he promises. Eli Sunday establishes the Church of the Third Revelation and becomes a force that Daniel must compromise with to maintain control of property rights and workers.As character study, the film is exceptional. We see Daniel as a man of amazing drive and determination. He is ambitious and crafty. These characteristics lead to outstanding industry and internal corruption. He moves from a speculator who strategizes to get oil out of the ground to a man obsessed with control of the land rights of the oil fields and the maneuvers needed to outwit his competition and maintain power.  He cares for the orphan HW but his parenting skills and priorities are out of order. HW is rendered deaf in a derrick explosion and eventually Daniel is able to get him into a school for the deaf where he learns sign language allowing him to communicate. Daniel also opens up when he thinks his long lost younger brother, Henry, joins him and wishes to work in the oil field. In conversation with Henry we hear Daniel's philosophy with such comments as: ""I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed.""  He also states: ""I hate most people."" Later he says: ""I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.""  Prophetically he says:""I want to make enough money to get away from everyone.""  It is with Eli Sunday that we see revealed the most amazing sides of Daniel's personality. Daniel relishes in humiliating the evangelist and his family until through the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli gains power over the local landowners and Daniel must become `saved' and part of the congregation to gain access to their land-rights. Daniel must undergo the trial of acting like his soul has been saved by Jesus so as to gain financial advantage. This humiliation further buries his soul under his unresolved inner demons and pain, twisting him further from human experience and compassion. Daniel Day-Lewis plays this role with attention to every small detail of expression which paints a frightening portrait of fierce heartless greed and lust for power driven by some inner absence of recognition of his fellowman's dignity.The character of Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano, is only a bit less complex.  This young man gains power through evangelical fundamentalism and after several years of humiliation and beating from Daniel, seeks his revenge is forcing Daniel to become saved by Jesus to gain property rights. But Eli knows that Daniel is not really saved, for Eli also is prideful and uses his church as a theater to degrade and belittle Daniel when he knows Daniel is desperate for the land rights to take his oil to the Pacific Ocean.In addition to an astute character study, the film is also a study in American capitalism and American evangelism. We see the dark under belly of both and we see the results when the two forces clash.

1124245,A1MVLC8E5WJDD3,B00104QSOM,C. Boerger,"[3, 8]","P.T. Anderson is one of the more interesting filmmakers working today, and one of the most maddening. I've seen all his films, and will continue to see them, which says something, yet while I usually go into a P.T. Anderson film hoping to love it, because it looks so good on paper, I invariably end up leaving disappointed, frustrated, empty, with the sense that the movie could have should have been so much better if only it had been imbued with certain qualities, namely emotional and intellectual depth. There Will Be Blood is Anderson's best film, and in some ways is close to being a masterpiece, but ultimately it left me with the same feeling of emptiness as the others and with a boatload of reservations. TWBB is an unqualifiedly interesting film, but is it unqualifiedly great? I would have to say no. Part of me thinks that it is a great film, the rest of me thinks it is only pretty good. In order to explain this ambivalence it is necessary for me to explain my feelings toward the director himself.The snobbish critic David Thomson(who strangely enough reveres Anderson) derides directors such as Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese for ""knowing more about film than they know about life."" I think that description applies to Anderson more than it does to anyone else. I get the sense that P.T. Anderson(The Man Who Would Be Kubrick, or Scorsese, or Fill In The Name Of Director Here) doesn't filter the scenes in his films through the prism of his own real life experiences, he filters them through his idiosyncratic artistic conceits and most of all through his experiences watching other people's films, and as a result his movies come across as quirky for the sake of being quirky, movieish for the sake of being movieish. An example of this is the much discussed ending of There Will Be Blood, which borrows heavily from Stanley Kubrick, particularly A Clockwork Orange. Like Orange, TWBB ends with its protagonist uttering a deadpan one-liner dripping with irony, ""I'm finished"" instead of ""I was cured."" Like Kubrick, Anderson juxtaposes a spirited piece of classical music(in this case Brahms instead of Rossini) with visions of violence and depravity. It's as if, while mapping out this scene, Anderson asked himself, ""What would Stanley Kubrick do?"" Fine, if you're looking for filmic inspiration you can't do much better than Kubrick. The problem is, the black comic tone of the finale is completely inappropriate to the rest of the film. In effect, Anderson's films end up being amalgams of interesting, often great scenes that don't really cohere, that just remind the viewer of the works of superior directors(Kubrick, Altman, Scorsese, Huston, Welles...). Anderson seems insistent that none of his scenes be boring or predictable, hence we get instances in TWBB of Daniel Plainview beating the hell out of Eli Sunday for no apparent reason. Is this really how the character would react in these circumstances? Or is it just Anderson thinking, every scene in every one of my movies must serve to augment my pedigree as a brilliant artiste, therefore I'm just going to give free reign to my idiosyncrasies and if people don't like it, the hell with them, they're Philistines anyway? Does he intentionally underdevelop his characters for the sole purpose of being able to get away with such weirdness, allowing himself to fall back on a cushion of artistic ambiguity? In other words, you can't really question the motivation of a character you don't understand, right? In the same vein, why does Plainview's adopted son H.W. spend the entire film with the same dull, oblique look on his face? One gets the impression that Anderson saw a character in another film with a similarly unwavering expression(Barry Lyndon perhaps?), thought it was cool, and wanted to copy the effect, because it really does little toward creating any empathy for the boy. Since H.W. is such a cipher anyway, we never question his steadfast bemusement. It's rather ironic, isn't it, that Anderson expects his audience to be disturbed by the way Plainview uses his son as a prop, even though the filmmaker himself is no better. H.W. is nothing more than a prop in the film, a vehicle for showing how emotionally stunted his adoptive father is. By the way, in the book Oil! the boy is actually the central character, we see the events through his eyes, and in effect he is a three-dimensional person. For me, this represents a missed opportunity on Anderson's part, a chance to provide the audience with symnpathetic counterpoint to the twisted megalomaniacal father figure rather than a half-formed child who goes deaf as a pretext for shuttling him off to San Francisco, and out of the story, and who doesn't grow up until the last act. Again, this is a case of forsaking reality in the service of inappropriate quirkiness, or movieness, or whatever you want to call it, and the result is a lack of an emotional connection between the film and the viewer.  Every Anderson movie strikes me the same way. Even the overwrought Magnolia, awash in tears, failed to elicit an emotional response, and since I approach any work of art WANTING to be deeply affected, I place the blame on Anderson's shoulders instead of my own.But to focus solely on the negatives is to deny what a truly entertaining and engrossing film this really is. Enough has been said about Daniel Day Lewis' performance already, so I won't add to it except to say that while he's onscreen(which is most of the film) you can't take your eyes off of him. Ditto the cinematography, this is a visually stunning motion picture. I also enjoyed the music, which is discordant, sometimes to the point of being off-putting, but always appropriate to the mood and rhythm of the moment. The opening scene, though also greatly indebted to Kubrick(the beginning of 2001 to be exact, with its lack of dialogue and jarring, atonal music), is astonishing. I greatly admire Anderson's style in certain types of scenes, I loved individual episodes, I liked the movie as a whole, I'm just not entirely convinced that what I saw is a masterpiece, or that Anderson is capable of creating a masterpiece unless he stops watching movies all the time and starts focusing on the real world.The fact that I was inspired to write this review, disjointed as it is, must indicate that I have been thinking a lot about There Will Be Blood, and I am interested in watching the picture again, which is always a good thing. Is that enough to make this a great film? The jury is still out.",4,A great film...or is it?,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,6523,"['P.T', 'Anderson', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'filmmakers', 'working', 'today', 'one', 'most', 'maddening',

Desert land is being bought up and wells are being dug by hand. One of these pioneers is Daniel (Lewis). Having already made his fortune he travels with his adopted son to a small desert shack said to be containing oil.Overnight Daniel buys up thousands of acres and turns this one shack is turned into a full size town with a train station, roads, house for workers, and accompanying businesses. This first 1:10 is very exhilarating as we see a how a town is built from scratch and progress is made. The excellent photography and musically score also add to this.However the next 1:30 minutes are a downward spiral. Both Daniel and the plot seem to stagger forward without direction on substance. Daniel abandons his son whom goes deaf and mad after an accident and murders a con man pretenting to be his lost brother. Down right embarrassing are the scenes with a crazed preacher with a Christ complex who mocks Daniel. These scenes were not humorous even in a dark way.

The Rockies run to the WS, and two little films entitled There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men. Both brilliant epics, one being substantially better than the other. That one is Blood.Daniel-Day Lewis. Wow. Hard to imagine a better actor ever gracing this earth. The movie is based around Day-Lewis. It's what makes the picture click. PTA is a great director, no doubt, but this is Daniel's show.Day-Lewis plays a man named Daniel Plainview. Kind of a mean guy, really. But he is an entreprenuer who adopts a baby left behind by one of his dead workers. He uses the kid to make profit and put a smile on people's faces. The entire film is about plainview making his fortune via any means necessary. And by the end, you'll feel like you got hit with a baseball bat.This movie is HUGE, the definition of a major motion picture. But not hokey in any way. Its not Pirates or King Kong. It is a stunning masterwork on all levels, from the script to the cinematography to Day-Lewis' performance. This is an earnest as a film gets.Idiot viewer beware: if you think that the film has heaps of gratuitious violence because of the name or that you won't have to do any thinking to comprehend it, please, go enjoy Norbit instead. This movie is the equivalent of a social issues class, hitting you over the head with morals and practically shouting questions at you in so many words.Trust me. See this movie. Unless you qualify as a retard like some of the other reviewers on this site. It SHOULD have won best picture at the oscars. No Country did because that movie was packaged flawlessly in every which way. But Blood is gritty, not too stylish, and perfect for the thinking viewer. Sometimes I think that the only reason NCFOM got so much praise was because it was a Coen brothers film. If you had seated Michael Bay or someone to make that film, well then Blood would have been noted as practically the ONLY film in 2007 worth a hoot.P.S.for every Bush-lovin, flag-wavin America fanatic out there, which I am indeed not, you had better love this film because it doesn't get any more purely American than this.",5,American Classic...,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,2197,"['Let', 'face', 'America', 'world', 'were', 'dull', '2007', 'Here', 'what', 'was', 'interesting', 'Rockies', 'run', 'WS', 'two', 'little', 'films', 'entitled', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'brilliant', 'epics', 'one', 'being', 'substantially', 'better', 'other', 'one', 'Blood.Daniel-Day', 'Lewis', 'Wow', 'Hard', 'imagine', 'better', 'actor', 'ever', 'gracing', 'earth', 'movie', 'based', 'Day-Lewis', 'what', 'picture', 'click', 'PTA', 'great', 'director', 'doubt', 'Daniel', 'show.Day-Lewis', 'man', 'named', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Kind', 'mean', 'guy', 'really', 'entreprenuer', 'who', 'baby', 'left', 'behind', 'one', 'dead', 'workers', 'kid', 'make', 'profit', 'put', 'smile', 'people', 'entire', 'film', 'plainview', 'making', 'fortune', 'means', 'necessary', 'end', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'got', 'hit', 'baseball', 'bat.This', 'movie', 'HUGE', 'definition', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'not', 'hokey', 'way', 'not', 'Pirates', 'King', 'Kong', 'stunning', 'masterwork', 'levels', 'script', 'cinematography', 'Day-Lewis', 'performance', 'earnest', 'film', 'gets.Idiot', 'viewer', 'beware', 'think', 'film', 'heaps', 'gratuitious', 'violence', 'name', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'thinking', 'comprehend', 'please', 'go', 'enjoy', 'Norbit', 'instead', 'movie', 'equivalent', 'social', 'issues', 'class', 'hitting', 'head', 'morals', 'practically', 'shouting', 'questions', 'so', 'many', 'words.Trust', 'See', 'movie', 'qualify', 'retard', 'other', 'reviewers', 'site', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'oscars', 'Country', 'did', 'movie', 'was', 'packaged', 'flawlessly', 'way', 'Blood', 'gritty', 'not', 'too', 'stylish', 'perfect', 'thinking', 'viewer', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'only', 'reason', 'NCFOM', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'praise', 'was', 'was', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'had', 'seated', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'someone', 'make', 'film', 'well', 'then', 'Blood', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'noted', 'practically', 'ONLY', 'film', '2007', 'worth', 'hoot.P.S.for', 'Bush-lovin', 'flag-wavin', 'America', 'fanatic', 'there', 'am', 'indeed', 'not', 'had', 'better', 'love', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'purely', 'American']",There Will Be Blood
1124249,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00104QSOM,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 6]","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an oilman, pure and simple. He searches for it, buys, cheats, or steals the land where he finds it, and then he drills for it. He has little patience for human realations, but sees everything as a magnificent struggle, with the land, with the oil, with the workers he must hire to drill for it. You wouldn't like this man, but you'd respect, or at the very least, fear him. He is like a force of nature, and only pretends to have normal human feelings in order to negotiate a better deal when he is buying, cheating, or stealing land on which to drill for oil. Daniel Day-Lewis has really thrown himself into the role, and he aims to play the role to the hilt, without caring at all about the audience liking his character. In fact, the less you like him, the better he is doing his job. But it can be lonely, and when he thinks he has found a long lost brother, Henry Brand (Kevin J. O'Connor), he confesses his feelings:Daniel Plainview: I see the worst in people. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little, Henry... to have you here gives me a second breath. I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people.[laughs]He adopts a son, if only to have a friendly face to distract the people when he comes to buy, cheat, or steal their land. When the boy becomes ill, he sends him away. A preacher from the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano .... Dwayne in Little Miss Sunshine) is trying to manipulate him into giving money to his church. Eli sunday tries to make him feel guilty in order to exploit him.Eli Sunday: So say it now- I am a sinner.Plainview: I am a sinner.Eli Sunday: Say it louder- I am a sinner!Plainview: I am a sinner.Eli Sunday: Louder, Daniel. I am a sinner!Plainview: I am a sinner.Eli Sunday: I am sorry Lord!Plainview: I am sorry Lord.Eli Sunday: I want the blood!Plainview: I want the blood.Eli Sunday: You have abandoned your child!Plainview: I have abandoned my child.Eli Sunday: I will never backslide!Plainview: I will never backslide.Eli Sunday: I was lost, but now I am found!Plainview: I was lost but now I'm found.Eli Sunday: I have abandoned my child![Plainview glares at him]Eli Sunday: Say it... say it![Plainview mumbles]Eli Sunday: Say it louder... say it louder!Plainview: I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my boy!The Sunday farm is only fit for growing weeds, and raising goats. The soil is alkaline, and the water is salty but there is oil. The only problem for Eli is that his brother Paul Sunday (also played by Paul Dano in a dual role) has already sold the land to Plainview.Eli Sunday: Daniel, I'm asking if you'd like to have business with the Church of the Third Revelation in developing this lease on young Bandy's thousand acre tract. I'm offering you to drill on one of the great undeveloped fields of Little Boston!Plainview: I'd be happy to work with you.Eli Sunday: You would? Yes, yes, of course. Wonderful.Plainview: But there is one condition for this work.Eli Sunday: All right.Plainview: I'd like you to tell me that you are a false prophet... I'd like you to tell me that you are, and have been, a false prophet... and that God is a superstition.Eli Sunday: ...but that's a lie... it's a lie, I cannot say it.[long pause]Eli Sunday: When can we begin to drill?Plainview: Right away.Eli Sunday: How long will it take to bring in the well?Plainview: Should be very quick.Eli Sunday: I would like a one hundred thousand dollar signing bonus plus the five that is owed with interest.Plainview: That's only fair.Eli Sunday: I am a false prophet and God is a superstition. If that's what you believe, then I will say it.Plainview: Say it like you mean it.Eli Sunday: Daniel...Plainview: Say it like it's your sermon.Eli Sunday: This is foolish.[long pause]Eli Sunday: I am a false prophet! God is a superstition! I am a false prophet! God is a superstition! I am a false prophet! God is a superstition![pause]Eli Sunday: Is that fine?Plainview: Those areas have been drilled.Eli Sunday: What?Plainview: Those areas have been drilled.Eli Sunday: ...no they haven't...Plainview: It's called drainage. I own everything around it... so I get everything underneath it.Eli Sunday: But there are no derricks there. This is the Bandy tract. Do you understand?Plainview: Do you? I drink your water, Eli. I drink it up. Everyday. I drink the blood of lamb from Bandy's tract.[How can this be? Plainview is really taking delight in turning the tables on the 'false prophet.']Plainview: Drainage! Drainage, Eli, you boy. Drained dry. I'm so sorry. Here, if you have a milkshake, and I have a milkshake, and I have a straw. There it is, that's a straw, you see? You watching?. And my straw reaches acroooooooss the room, and starts to drink your milkshake... I... drink... your... milkshake![sucking sound]Plainview: I drink it up!There Will Be Blood is a tour de force performance from Daniel Day-Lewis. You might not like the character he is playing, but you have to admit that he is totally commited to that character, and matches Plainview's intensity, pound for pound, every second he is onscreen.The cinematography and settings are magnificent. The composer of the film's music was Jonny Greenwood, primarily famous as the guitarist for the British rock band Radiohead. There is some Brahms and music from other composers, but the bulk of the music was by Greenwood, and it really adds to the epic granduer. This is an epic of man against nature. There are long stretches where there is no dialogue at all, just man battling against nature, struggling and striving to pump that oil out of the ground. Living in Bakersfield, an oil town, I see oil derricks all around me. Some of the action takes place right here, for instance, scenes were shot in Santa Clarita, and they talk of a pipeline through the Tehachapi Mountains. That is right down Kern Canyon. We have a Kern County Oil Museum, and other historic sights in Taft. All that history is right around us, and it made me curious about how they got all the oil pumping. There Will Be Blood tells that story very well.TEN PIVOTAL ROLES OF DANIEL DAY-LEWISGangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)(2002) ....

1124253,ACBFF25XJC2T7,B00104QSOM,Choice Critic,"[0, 3]","This movie is as good as it gets in modern moviemaking.  Daniel Day-Lewis, our greatest living actor, adds his greatest character portrayal yet to a seemingly unlimited range of characters past. He plays Daniel Plainview an oil wildcatter during the age of the post-Reconstruction ""Robber Barons.""Not all of the Robber Barons were financial wizards like Jay Gould or conniving accounting monopolists like John D. Rockefeller, unethically stealing the profits of the hard working entrepreneurs who made the great oil and mineral discoveries of the time.  Daniel represents the driven, rugged individualist who resisted and defeated Rockefeller and the railroads' attempts to reap the fortune of his almost literally back-breaking efforts.But in his quest, struggle and ultimate financial success Plainview pays a heavy price. The brutal, ruthless life he leads to attain his ambition for wealth leaves him resembling more a denizen of nature  than a resident of the human race. Whether he lost his soul in his childhood, in his quest, or never had one in the first place, is for the viewer to decide.The scene with his ""brother"", Henry, is truly chilling when Daniel first reveals his brutal, misanthropic nature. Only Daniel Day-Lewis could deliver such blood curdling dialogue in that scene; slowly, in a philosophical manner explaining to Henry his hateful feelings toward all others with a fatalistic smile on his face.  He is a man comfortable in a skin in which many others would not be.  Kevin J. O'Connor's portrayal of Henry is outstanding as a desperate soul who never betrays Daniel, and is as loyal as a brother, but dies at Daniel's hand.Daniel, as is shown throughout the movie, has a very perverse view of family and loyalty.  The development of his relationship with his adoptive son, H.W., is the clearest view into Daniel's character and ultimately renders the final verdict on Daniel's lifelong quest for wealth. Daniel's hardened and embittered nature is never shown more pointedly, and brutally, than in his final scene with H.W. (""a [...]in a basket!""). It is the savagely destructive psychological counterpart to the physical destruction Daniel wreaks in the final scene with Eli Sunday, the ""false prophet"".Paul Dano as Eli Sunday, the greedy charismatic preacher, has received many accolades for his performance.  It is good, though not as good as O'Connor's ""Henry"" or the young H.W. (Dillon Freasier).The main problem is not so much Dano's performance as his character's physical appearance.  Day-Lewis ages slowly but markedly through the thirty-five year period of the movie.  Dano, however, looks exactly the same age in the final confrontation in the bowling alley as he does when he first encounters Daniel at Eli's family dinner table.There is also a scene later in the movie, some time after the scene at the family dinner table, in which Daniel beats and humiliates Eli in front of others.  It is almost a cinematic non-sequitur since the tension and rivalry between the two has not built to the point to justify the scene.Regardless, those two items of criticism are slight in the context of a truly great movie.  The cinematography and the musical score lend greatly to its dark atmospherics. It is encouraging to see that it was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson whose previous undistinguished work includes the voyeuristically juvenile ""Boogie Nights"" and the embarrassing attempt at romantic comedy, ""Punch Drunk Love"".It does shows that an artist can grow beyond the exploitative and immature sides of Hollywood cinema as he matures.  It undoubtedly helped Thomas to have Daniel Day-Lewis as the star, rather than an Adam Sandler.  This is Day-Lewis's movie and he is the best.I have used the word ""brutal"" on a number of occasions in this review.  The era of the Robber Barons was just that.  This movie effectively conveys the history you may read about the era and the unforgiving state of nature that produced men like Daniel Plainview.As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the Plainview character is ""loosely"" based on a character named Vern Roscoe in the novel ""Oil,"" written by Upton Sinclair. Sinclair's fictional character, in turn, was ""loosely"" based on a real person, named Edward L. Doheny.  He is profiled in Wikipedia if you would like more information about him.All such ""loose"" associations are irrelevant in a great movie. Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis have produced a cinematic masterpiece. It will be considered a classic in due time because of the timelessness of its theme and the greatness of its performances.I'm finished.",5,Epic Movie about an Epic Era,1224288000,"10 18, 2008",2008,4601,"['movie', 'as', 'good', 'modern', 'moviemaking', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'greatest', 'living', 'actor', 'greatest', 'character', 'portrayal', 'yet', 'seemingly', 'unlimited', 'range', 'characters', 'past', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'oil', 'wildcatter', 'age', 'post-Reconstruction', 'Robber', 'Barons', 'Not', 'Robber', 'Barons', 'were', 'financial', 'wizards', 'Jay', 'Gould', 'conniving', 'accounting', 'monopolists', 'John', 'D.', 'Rockefeller', 'unethically', 'stealing', 'profits', 'hard', 'working', 'entrepreneurs', 'who', 'made', 'great', 'oil', 'mineral', 'discoveries', 'time', 'Daniel', 'driven', 'rugged', 'individualist', 'who', 'resisted', 'defeated', 'Rockefeller', 'railroads', 'attempts', 'reap', 'fortune', 'almost', 'literally', 'back-breaking', 'efforts.But', 'quest', 'struggle', 'ultimate', 'financial', 'success', 'Plainview', 'heavy', 'price', 'brutal', 'ruthless', 'life', 'attain', 'ambition', 'wealth', 'resembling', 'more', 'denizen', 'nature', 'resident', 'human', 'race', 'lost', 'soul', 'childhood', 'quest', 'never', 'had', 'one', 'first', 'place', 'viewer', 'decide.The', 'scene', 'brother', 'Henry', 'truly', 'chilling', 'when', 'Daniel', 'first', 'brutal', 'misanthropic', 'nature', 'Only', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'could', 'deliver', 'such', 'blood', 'curdling', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'slowly', 'philosophical', 'manner', 'explaining', 'Henry', 'hateful', 'feelings', 'others', 'fatalistic', 'smile', 'face', 'man', 'comfortable', 'skin', 'many', 'others', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'Kevin', 'J.', ""O'Connor"", 'portrayal', 'Henry', 'outstanding', 'desperate', 'soul', 'who', 'never', 'Daniel', 'as', 'loyal', 'brother', 'Daniel', 'hand.Daniel', 'shown', 'movie', 'very', 'perverse', 'view', 'family', 'loyalty', 'development', 'relationship', 'adoptive', 'son', 'H.W.', 'clearest', 'view', 'Daniel', 'character', 'ultimately', 'final', 'verdict', 'Daniel', 'lifelong', 'quest', 'wealth', 'Daniel', 'hardened', 'embittered', 'nature', 'never', 'shown', 'more', 'pointedly', 'brutally', 'final', 'scene', 'H.W', '[', ']', 'basket', 'savagely', 'destructive', 'psychological', 'counterpart', 'physical', 'destruction', 'Daniel', 'final', 'scene', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'false', 'prophet', '.Paul', 'Dano', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'greedy', 'charismatic', 'preacher', 'received', 'many', 'accolades', 'performance', 'good', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'good', ""O'Connor"", 'Henry', 'young', 'H.W', 'Dillon', 'Freasier', '.The', 'main', 'problem', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Dano', 'performance', 'character', 'physical', 'appearance', 'Day-Lewis', 'ages', 'slowly', 'markedly', 'thirty-five', 'year', 'period', 'movie', 'Dano', 'however', 'exactly', 'same', 'age', 'final', 'confrontation', 'bowling', 'alley', 'when', 'first', 'Daniel', 'Eli', 'family', 'dinner', 'also', 'scene', 'later', 'movie', 'time', 'scene', 'family', 'dinner', 'table', 'Daniel', 'beats', 'humiliates', 'Eli', 'front', 'others', 'almost', 'cinematic', 'non-sequitur', 'tension', 'rivalry', 'two', 'not', 'built', 'point', 'justify', 'scene.Regardless', 'two', 'items', 'criticism', 'are', 'slight', 'context', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'musical', 'score', 'lend', 'greatly', 'dark', 'atmospherics', 'encouraging', 'see', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'undistinguished', 'work', 'voyeuristically', 'juvenile', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'embarrassing', 'attempt', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', '.It', 'artist', 'can', 'grow', 'exploitative', 'immature', 'sides', 'Hollywood', 'cinema', 'undoubtedly', 'helped', 'Thomas', 'have', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'star', 'rather', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Day-Lewis', 'movie', 'best.I', 'have', 'used', 'word', 'brutal', 'number', 'occasions', 'review', 'era', 'Robber', 'Barons', 'was', 'just', 'that', 'movie', 'effectively', 'conveys', 'history', 'may', 'read', 'era', 'unforgiving', 'state', 'nature', 'produced', 'men', 'Daniel', 'Plainview.As', 'been', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Plainview', 'character', 'loosely', 'based', 'character', 'named', 'Vern', 'Roscoe', 'novel', 'Oil', 'written', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', 'Sinclair', 'fictional', 'character', 'turn', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'named', 'Edward', 'L.', 'Doheny', 'profiled', 'Wikipedia', 'would', 'like', 'more', 'information', 'him.All', 'such', 'loose', 'associations', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'great', 'movie', 'Anderson', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'have', 'produced', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'due', 'time', 'timelessness', 'theme', 'greatness', 'performances.I', ""'m"", 'finished']",There Will Be Blood
1124254,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00104QSOM,Chris Pandolfi,"[150, 179]","""There Will Be Blood"" is probably the absolute best film of the year, and this is due to more than the extraordinary talent of Daniel Day-Lewis. At its core, it tells a story of insatiable greed, of how the lust for absolute power can drive anyone into a state of pure evil. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"" the descent of oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (Lewis) is long and slow, but it's definitely constant--he starts off in 1902 with drive, passion, and charisma, only to lose himself to hate, arrogance, and a complete lack of decency by 1927. By the end of the film, absolutely nothing about this man is likeable, and one gets the sense that he wanted it that way all along: ""I hate most people,"" he says at one point. ""I look at people and I see nothing worth liking."" Here's a character that can't be pitied, simply because he created exactly what he wanted for himself.The first ten minutes of ""There Will Be Blood"" contains no dialogue, but it still manages to establish a cohesive story. It begins in 1898, during which a lone prospector digs for oil in the mountainous deserts of Texas. By 1902, an entire team led by Plainview has made camp in the area and has successfully struck oil. One day, a well accident kills one of the workers, leaving an infant boy without his father. For as yet unknown reasons--be they selfless or selfish--Plainview decides to care for the boy and raise him as his own. The story then flashes forward to 1911, which opens with Plainview trying to negotiate a deal with the locals of a small town. When the deal falls through, Plainview is introduced to Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), a young man from a small community called Little Boston; he offers Plainview his family's property in exchange for a handsome sum of money. Apparently, that property is rich with oil.Without missing a beat, Plainview and his son, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), enter Little Boston posing as quail hunters. After discovering that the Sunday property does, indeed, contain oil, and after setting up camp with his team, Plainview gets acquainted with the devoutly religious Sunday family. The son, Eli (also played by Paul Dano), is thought to be a spiritual healer, and he shows this side of himself during some passionate church meetings. He and Plainview share an interesting relationship, to say the least; Plainview initially states that he likes all churches and thus doesn't belong to any specific sect of Christianity, but as the film progresses, it's obvious that church--or more specifically, God--has not and never will be a part of his life. Eli, who believes he has the power to heal his fellow parishioners, falls into disfavor when H.W. has an oil-related accident that can't be healed.Things take an unexpected turn when a man claiming to be Plainview's long lost half brother enters the picture. His name is Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), and he's come from a job in New Mexico to be a part of Plainview's life, to work for him and help him find more oil. Something about him clearly isn't right from H.W.'s point of view, and he makes this clear through a drastic act I won't reveal. I will say that, as time goes on, Plainview also begins to suspect Henry, which actually isn't saying a whole lot since his very nature is to be distrustful. One understands this all throughout the film--with even the subtlest of expressions, Plainview can easily express the anger, hostility, and fear that are slowly taking control. It seems all he has left is to let himself be manipulated, especially by Eli: if he wants permission to run an oil pipe through a piece of property he doesn't own, he must agree to be baptized in Eli's church. And as you might expect, Eli will actually be leading the ceremony. Watching Plainview being forced to say things he doesn't believe is a mesmerizing experience, not only because it foreshadows what lies ahead, but also because the scene is incredibly intense.Pretty much the same thing can be said about the entire film, which thrives on tension despite appearing to be low-key. One of Lewis' expressions is an almost frightening counterpoint to Johnny Greenwood's score, a Bernard Hermann-inspired opus of screeching, tremulous strings. Such music is heard even during the ""calmer,"" ""insignificant"" moments, such as shots of Plainview walking from one room to another. This would be inappropriate were this any other film. But this isn't any other film; ""There Will Be Blood"" is all about expressing Plainview's emotional turmoil, and as such, it's easy to believe that he's never had a quiet moment in his head. It's also easy to believe that entering his mind would be one of the most terrifying experiences imaginable, not just because of his contempt for humanity, but also because of the depths to which his contempt will sink him.The final twenty minutes of this film takes place in 1927, at which point Plainview is more morally than physically aged. He's rich beyond his wildest dreams, yet he's emotionally bankrupt, and this is shown through two brief but significant meetings. I won't describe what happens or reveal whom he speaks to, but I will say he does everything he can to make everyone hate him, including us. In essence, we hate him just as much as he hates himself, which isn't pathetic so much as it's detestable. I realize that such an ending is not a typical crowd pleaser, but considering the story that's being told, typical doesn't apply, here. This goes double for Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, one of the best I've seen in a long time. To sum everything up with a brief phrase, ""There Will Be Blood"" is an absolutely brilliant film.",5,"Greed, That is. Black Gold.

1124255,AN9J46667D80O,B00104QSOM,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[1, 3]","This is, hands down, without a doubt, one of the strangest damn movies I have ever seen. Unsettling and weird and wonderful and fantastic.The plot is simple: a man, Daniel Plainview, steamrollers over everyone and everything in his path in order to get oil, and thereby, money and power. There's a great many comparisons that can be made between this character and Charles Foster Kane (and if you haven't seenCitizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition), do so), the primary difference being that Kane at least was somewhat likable. The best you can say for Plainview is that he is, at times, pitiable.Mostly the movie is a character study, pitting Plainview against a young preacher, Eli Sunday. His church is called The Church of the Third Revelation, which if you're a smart-a$$ like me tells you everything you need to know about who he is and what he does. Suffice to say that in modern times he'd have big hair, a bad suit and the ability to cry/plead for money on cue whenever a TV camera is on him.It's very hard to describe this movie beyond what I've said, at least as far as the plot goes. The cinematography is mind-blowing and the music is... well, effective. There's a weird sound that plays over the soundtrack from time to time. It sounds rather like an air-raide siren if you only played out the first note of it and then didn't stop.It is one of the most memorable and effective films I've ever seen. It's very hard to watch at times, but entirely worth it, if for no other reason than Daniel Day-Lewis' performance.One last note: whomever thought this was a good idea for DVD packaging needs to be smacked, cause it totally isn't.

1124257,ASU5IH3CM6XXE,B00104QSOM,ChrisTyrrell,"[6, 14]","As a movie, this movie is not any good.  There Will Be Blood is a film about Daniel-Day-Lewis as an oil man who has a son and a bowling alley, but it's not like Vice Versa or like The Big Lebowski.  The story begins in the time of World War I, when gold prospectors and oil prospectors were looking for gold and oil, respectively, whilst real Americans were fighting the Germans.  I don't want to make my review too political, though, because I could go on for days!Daniel-Day-Lewis plays his part like a game show host, and for all the talk of how wonderful he is in the role, I just don't get it.  He got an Oscar for this?  I think he did not deserve the Academy Award over Clint Eastwood for the Space Cowboys movie.  I know that the Academy probably feels they've awarded Clint too much in the past, but I think that's silly because he's so talented and just because he's always great, doesn't mean a cliched movie like There Will Be Blood should benefit!!I don't like that the movie is in black and white, although stylistically I understand what Paul Thomas Anderson was going for.  The guy that played the priest was really good, and I was rooting for him to beat Daniel-Day-Lewis in every scene.  This movie might have made more sense if they cut the part about Daniel-Day-Lewis' son--there is such a thing as too much plot!--and focused on the oil parts, since that's what it's about.I'm not saying that There Will Be Blood should have been a musical, but if the directors had made it a little peppier, it might have been a fun little film.  As it is, it's probably one of the worst things you could ever watch, and when your kids say they want to see it you should make sure to watch it with them because it has strong adult themes.I believe in America, but I do not believe in this movie.

1124261,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00104QSOM,Clare Quilty,"[3, 6]","I'm a huge P.T. Anderson fan and, of course, was very excited when -- years after ""Punch-Drunk Love"" -- he reappeared with a new movie: ""There Will Be Blood,"" a two-and-a-half hour epic about oil prospectors at the turn of the century. I saw it the day it opened.On my first viewing, though, I didn't know what I thought. I respected the film. I thought Day-Lewis was amazing. I knew it was a daring, challenging effort. But I didn't know if I actually liked it, especially that crazy ending. The whole thing seemed to contain very little of the P.T.A. that I liked so much.I was so perplexed I went back and saw it again. And that's when it really affected me. That's when certain sequences -- an oil fire, a speech about schools and bread, even just the sight of a drifting cloud shading a desert camp, a dab of oil on a baby's forehead or the shapes of oil wells sprung up on the horizon -- became profoundly, inescapably moving.This is a movie so rich and deliberate and limestone-dense that knowing what will happen in the end actually sharpens its impact. It's in a second viewing that one can fully appreciate the characterization Daniel Day-Lewis brings to the role of Plainview.But other elements are just as strong or very nearly -- young Dillon Freasier, who had not acted before, is astonishingly potent as Plainview's mostly silent son; Kevin J. O'Connor uncannily mirrors and converses Day-Lewis' characterization; Ciaran Hinds does a lot with very little as Fletcher Hamilton, Plainview's tough but watchful and subtly tender right-hand-man. And much was written about the abrasive edges of Jonny Greenwood's string-heavy score, but it's impossible to listen to a piece like, for example, ""Prospector Arrives"" and not be moved; he's created a rarity of a score -- music that's absolutely inseparable from the film, and almost seems to have been created simultaneously with the direction.The movie's biggest talent, however, is Anderson. Many directors have lately tried to channel Terrence Malick (for example ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" which is a beautiful, haunting movie -- but really not much more than a gorgeous ode to ""Days of Heaven""). Anderson does evoke Malick, but he incorporates enough of his own style and voice that the film transcends imitation and becomes something else entirely -- possibly something greater even than Malick's own films.---The double-disk DVD is taking flack for not offering a wealth of material. But I think it's a fine, handsomely presented package. I think the extra disk offers just enough background on the film without giving away everything.A slideshow and through a 1923 documentary, ""The Story of Petroleum,"" offers many of the sources and much of the inspiration behind much of the movie, beyond what was drawn from Upton Sinclair's novel, ""Oil!""A fine deleted scene, ""Fishing,"" shows us that -- contrary to what Plainview tells a crowd early in the film -- he occasionally DOES lose his tools down the hole and has to spend weeks fishing for them. The scene is great to see -- and sheds a lot of light on the relationship between Daniel and Eli's father -- but it would've interrupted the flow of the final narrative, and I'm glad it wasn't in the final cut.I'm also glad there's no alternate audio track. Yes, P.T.A. gives some of the most interesting commentary around, but I honestly appreciate that he's leaving hidden some of the mysteries hidden behind this strange and wonderful and beautiful film. It's not for everyone, I realize, but I think it's the best movie of this year and last year and possibly the year before that. It just took me a second viewing to figure that out.",5,Didn't like it?

1124263,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00104QSOM,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","Part of me was not looking forward to ""There Will Be Blood"", the latest from Paul Thomas Anderson who did ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"". Part of it is that a lot of times the films come across as slightly pretentious; as if the film is genuinely a classic right out of the gate and anyone who says otherwise just doesn't know movies or hasn't seen it enough to fully appreciate it. However, I will admit the guy does have filmmaking talent and screenplay-wise, he writes very sharply and even in complex matters and with his latest, you can see that there is a solid filmmaker underneath here and indeed many were calling the film the best of 2007, but after 3 viewings, I still think there's promise but not a fully realized film here.The film takes place in the late 19th/20th century where self-made oilman Daniel Plainview has been going from place to place making promises and drilling in the ground for lucrative and money-making oil deposits. With his adoptive son, H.W., Daniel is quite ambitious and committed to his successes and amassing of wealth so when Paul Sunday of the town of Little Boston arrives with talks of an untapped oil deposit, Daniel and his son head down there only to find a problem in Eli Sunday, Paul's brother, who can sell and promote his church just as well as Daniel's love for oil and money.I recently saw Magnolia again, which was a film on first viewing I didn't really care for, but deciding to revisit it, I thought I'd at least give it another shot and while it still had its problems, I liked it slightly more. The same thing happened with this film where its pacing and length problems weren't as glaring and it's lack of a compelling narrative wasn't as troublesome. Ultimately, the film is more a character study than anything as we see a character get more demanding, oppressive and quite foregone. The comparisons to ""Citizen Kane"" are well founded and while the film did keep me interesting, there were other times where I felt it wasn't as compelling as it should've been.Every year there tends to be one of those performances where it's kind of obvious they're going to win so it was without shock that Daniel Day-Lewis won, who's utterly convincing and explosive who's quite comfortable slipping into his darker half. We have Paul Dano who holds his own despite the age difference (although his choking cat impression during a sermon is unintentionally funny, as well as Day-Lewis' ""drainage!"" line). Aside from H.W., and a role by Kevin J. O'Connor who's best known for comedic roles in ""the Mummy"" and ""Deep Rising"", everyone is kind of set dressing.Where the film stumbles a bit is in its score. Nothing wrong with it and some scenes work quite well but there's one sound, an irritating crescendo dissonance that opens the film and re-appears, is grating and in other scenes it doesn't quite match up. Then there's the ending scene which takes place in, of all places, a bowling alley, with unintentionally funny parts and a weird use of the word ""milkshake"". A subplot is needed for story and character but it still extends its length to dragging levels. But then its near-wordless opening sequence, a spectacular setpiece involving a derrick fire and Day-Lewis' performance keep you interested.Its less-than-stellar assortments of goodies aside, There Will Be Blood is indeed a worthy watch, however, I'm not going to call it an outright masterpiece because everyone says it is.",4,Climbing to the top can bring you to Hell,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,3436,"['Part', 'was', 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'latest', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'who', 'did', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Magnolia', 'Part', 'lot', 'times', 'films', 'come', 'slightly', 'pretentious', 'film', 'genuinely', 'classic', 'right', 'gate', 'anyone', 'who', 'otherwise', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'movies', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enough', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'However', 'will', 'admit', 'guy', 'have', 'filmmaking', 'talent', 'screenplay-wise', 'very', 'sharply', 'even', 'complex', 'matters', 'latest', 'can', 'see', 'solid', 'filmmaker', 'underneath', 'here', 'indeed', 'many', 'were', 'calling', 'film', 'best', '2007', '3', 'viewings', 'still', 'think', 'promise', 'not', 'fully', 'realized', 'film', 'here.The', 'film', 'place', 'late', '19th/20th', 'century', 'where', 'self-made', 'oilman', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'been', 'going', 'place', 'place', 'making', 'promises', 'drilling', 'ground', 'lucrative', 'money-making', 'oil', 'deposits', 'adoptive', 'son', 'H.W.', 'Daniel', 'quite', 'ambitious', 'committed', 'successes', 'amassing', 'wealth', 'so', 'when', 'Paul', 'Sunday', 'town', 'Little', 'Boston', 'talks', 'untapped', 'oil', 'deposit', 'Daniel', 'son', 'head', 'there', 'only', 'find', 'problem', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'Paul', 'brother', 'who', 'can', 'sell', 'promote', 'church', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'Daniel', 'love', 'oil', 'money.I', 'recently', 'saw', 'Magnolia', 'again', 'was', 'film', 'first', 'viewing', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'deciding', 'revisit', 'thought', ""'d"", 'least', 'give', 'shot', 'still', 'had', 'problems', 'liked', 'slightly', 'more', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'film', 'where', 'pacing', 'length', 'problems', 'were', ""n't"", 'glaring', 'lack', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'was', ""n't"", 'troublesome', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'anything', 'see', 'character', 'get', 'more', 'demanding', 'oppressive', 'quite', 'foregone', 'comparisons', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'are', 'well', 'founded', 'film', 'did', 'keep', 'interesting', 'were', 'other', 'times', 'where', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'compelling', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been.Every', 'year', 'there', 'be', 'one', 'performances', 'where', 'kind', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'going', 'win', 'was', 'shock', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'won', 'who', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'explosive', 'who', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'slipping', 'darker', 'half', 'have', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'who', 'own', 'age', 'difference', 'choking', 'cat', 'impression', 'sermon', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'Day-Lewis', 'drainage', 'line', 'Aside', 'H.W.', 'role', 'Kevin', 'J.', ""O'Connor"", 'who', 'best', 'known', 'comedic', 'roles', 'Mummy', 'Deep', 'Rising', 'everyone', 'kind', 'set', 'film', 'bit', 'score', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'scenes', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'one', 'sound', 'irritating', 'crescendo', 'dissonance', 'film', 're-appears', 'grating', 'other', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'up', 'Then', 'ending', 'scene', 'place', 'places', 'bowling', 'alley', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'parts', 'weird', 'use', 'word', 'milkshake', 'subplot', 'needed', 'story', 'character', 'still', 'length', 'dragging', 'levels', 'then', 'near-wordless', 'opening', 'sequence', 'spectacular', 'setpiece', 'involving', 'derrick', 'fire', 'Day-Lewis', 'performance', 'keep', 'interested.Its', 'less-than-stellar', 'assortments', 'goodies', 'aside', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'indeed', 'worthy', 'watch', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'call', 'outright', 'masterpiece', 'everyone']",There Will Be Blood
1124264,A2RTA6PN7OCLOM,B00104QSOM,ClydeNut,"[2, 3]","Film is quite an interesting art form. At times it can show quite alot on screen and say absolutely nothing, sometimes it can show very little on screen but make what little that is say quite a bit. Sometimes film can take a fairly simple premise of an oil tycoon trying to rise in his business and make something of true artistic value. But it doesn't only take reels of a film, it also takes a well rounded full plot to give the film the substance it needs to be true art.Let me begin with the character of Daniel Plainview; within the first few scenes, which are almost completely silent, Daniel Day-Lewis has transformed into a desperate, poor gold miner trying to make something of his life. Then that character is taken to be the working man, just trying to make a living. With a steady pace into the future, you find a wealthy, upper-class entrepreneur. But throughout the film, as his social status and wealth grew higher, the character that is truly inside him has grown lower and lower; he is never satisfied, and doesn't know how to satisfy himself other than trying to buy more land and creating a monopoly for himself. But as he buys more land and further builds his empire, his character sinks lower and lower. Daniel Plainview is a truly developed character in a film which is, essentially, a character study. This enough makes the film an intellectual fiesta. I could go into further analysis of this character, but I would be giving far too much away.Johnny Greenwood's score is fantastic; combined with the masterful cinematography, it is very well part of the story.

DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","I doubt if Upton Sinclair would recognize his muck-raking novel, Oil!, as the source more-or-less for There Will be Blood, but I hope he'd at least be impressed with Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious near-bullseye of a movie. I was engrossed all the way through, partly, of course, by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance. As much as Day-Lewis does an extraordinary job, Anderson's writing and directing, I think, deserve nearly as much praise. The only drawback I saw was that Daniel Plainview's character and story were simply too complex and rich to be easily contained in a movie. Plainview and his story requires a big, fat novel. I'm amazed and impressed that Anderson came as close as he did. In fact, I wound up reassessing my feelings toward Anderson. I'd always lumped him in with that group of his peers who were relatively young when they had a huge success, with Hollywood and the critics falling all over them praising them as the latest bunch of wunderkinds...then seeing them picture by next picture unable to come close to either matching their first success or going beyond it. If I had to characterize this group with one- or two-word descriptions, they'd be: Wes Anderson: Cocoon-boy; Quentin Tarentino: Permanent Juvenilia; Steven Soderbergh: Boring; Christopher Nolan: Gone Hollywood; Paul Thomas Anderson: Too self-conscious. (And this is all just personal opinion.)But with There Will Be Blood, Anderson, for me, shows huge growth and depth. I'm not sure how I'd characterize him now. Nothing the others have produced so far comes close, in my opinion, to the growth Anderson displays here. This is a movie of major, serious themes, and all about Plainview's character. I think in collaboration with Day-Lewis he has accomplished...well, I don't know. A masterpiece? Who knows...maybe we'll have a feeling about that in five or ten years. I think the movie is so rich in looking at Daniel Plainview that the movie will be be around for quite a while.",5,"A significant film, and one which shows significant growth from Paul Thomas Anderson",1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,1966,"['doubt', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', 'would', 'recognize', 'muck-raking', 'novel', 'Oil', 'source', 'more-or-less', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'hope', ""'d"", 'least', 'be', 'impressed', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'ambitious', 'near-bullseye', 'movie', 'was', 'engrossed', 'way', 'partly', 'course', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'performance', 'As', 'much', 'Day-Lewis', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'Anderson', 'writing', 'directing', 'think', 'deserve', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'praise', 'only', 'drawback', 'saw', 'was', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'character', 'story', 'were', 'simply', 'too', 'complex', 'rich', 'be', 'easily', 'contained', 'movie', 'Plainview', 'story', 'big', 'fat', 'novel', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'impressed', 'Anderson', 'came', 'as', 'close', 'did', 'fact', 'wound', 'up', 'reassessing', 'feelings', 'Anderson', ""'d"", 'always', 'lumped', 'group', 'peers', 'who', 'were', 'relatively', 'young', 'when', 'had', 'huge', 'success', 'Hollywood', 'critics', 'falling', 'praising', 'latest', 'bunch', 'wunderkinds', 'then', 'seeing', 'picture', 'next', 'picture', 'unable', 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'first', 'success', 'going', 'had', 'characterize', 'group', 'one-', 'two-word', 'descriptions', ""'d"", 'be', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Cocoon-boy', 'Quentin', 'Tarentino', 'Permanent', 'Juvenilia', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Boring', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Gone', 'Hollywood', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Too', 'self-conscious', 'just', 'personal', 'opinion', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Anderson', 'huge', 'growth', 'depth', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', ""'d"", 'characterize', 'now', 'Nothing', 'others', 'have', 'produced', 'so', 'far', 'close', 'opinion', 'growth', 'Anderson', 'here', 'movie', 'major', 'serious', 'themes', 'Plainview', 'character', 'think', 'collaboration', 'Day-Lewis', 'accomplished', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'masterpiece', 'Who', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'have', 'feeling', 'five', 'ten', 'years', 'think', 'movie', 'so', 'rich', 'looking', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'be', 'quite', 'while']",There Will Be Blood
1124267,AGHJ9BMVMGIOL,B00104QSOM,colinwoodward,"[8, 15]","""There Will Be Blood,"" which, if you haven't heard about, or seen, tells the story of an early-20th century oil tycoon, named Daniel Plainview, making his fortune in the American west. The movie tracks Plainview's rise from a lone miner (in the beginning, we see him break his leg going deep underground to grab $3 worth of gold) to a ruthless and powerful millionaire. Plainview eventually conquers a large patch of California oil territory. At the end of the movie, he is a wealthy but bitter, deranged man, shouting at his adopted son like a mad sultan.On a positive note, the movie looks fantastic. The period details--from the dress to the oil rigging to the polished bar wood--are excellent, and the movie won a deserved Oscar for cinematography. Daniel Day-Lewis is good in the role of Daniel Plainview, but familiar. He seems to be playing Bill the Butcher again, only this time on the West rather than East coast. Day-Lewis plays the role as bigger than life, but after a while, the movie needs less grandeur and more subtle humanity.I found the movie challenging, but also disappointing. For one, it's way too long. It might have been a great movie had it been about 100 minutes or so. But it simply doesn't have enough plot to justify its length. And in its two and a half hours, Day-Lewis's character occupies almost all of every scene. We don't like Plainview that much at the beginning. By the end, we loathe him. Most of the supporting cast members simply look on as we watch Day-Lewis dominate the proceedings.All this would be okay, I think, if director Paul Thomas Anderson knew when to let us have enough. Unfortunately, the movie's misanthropy is unrelenting and ultimately self-indulgent. That doesn't make for fun viewing. Some critics, such as Peter Travers and Roger Ebert, have brought up parallels between this movie and Citizen Kane. Kane, however, had a main character we cared about and secondary characters that were well-defined and sympathetic. Here, we see Plainview stomp and shout and threaten and drool, and after a while, we wish someone would put a bullet through his head. Charles Foster Kane could be cruel, but he was more sad than tyrannical. Plainview merely is a greedy sociopath.Citizen Kane also had a goal: we wanted to find out what ""Rosebud"" meant. Would Kane's last words solve the mystery of his life? Here, there's no sense of climax. It ends long after we feel it should have ended. And Anderson's handling of the last scene goes horribly wrong. It becomes a farce. Ever see an ending to a movie and feel like your watching the DVD extras--the version that was cut out--but you're not?Anderson is at his best when he doesn't try so hard. His first film, ""Hard Eight,"" and his previous one, ""Punch Drunk Love,"" are more focused than his more ambitious projects ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" Anderson has lots of talent, but like his contemporary Quentin Tarantino, he's erratic. Film buffs should demand of Anderson a movie that's more than just dust, blood, whiskey, and Old Testament bluster. ""There Will Be Blood"" starts promisingly, but as its main character descends into madness, the drama gets weaker not stronger.

Its ending would rank as one of the worst in history (think Akira Kurosawa's Rashomom) if only the rest of the film had been stronger. Also, in no way, shape, nor form is the film an `epic.' Other than the word `surreal' the term epic may be the most overused and misused word in the arts. An epic is a tale that covers a great deal of history, time, and place. It also delves deeply into the characters and plot. There Will Be Blood is a series of cursory sketches that are meager and often poorly connected. I spoke of the hit and miss cinematography, but the musical scoring to this film is even worse. And, even if one were to put aside the technical lack, and the script problems, there's the acting. It's simply not good. The two main characters, Lewis and Dano have no chemistry, in the sense that their hatred of each other never seems genuine. And, while Dano is a cipher emotionally, Lewis chews scenery even more than he did as Bill The Butcher In Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York. Granted, while not a great film, that film was better written than this one, but there is a certain cartoonishness in Lewis's portrayal that neuters all attempt at real drama. One cares not a damn for any of the mannekin-like characters- save perhaps for the faux brother, whose very fakeness was designed merely to show of Lewis's character's rage and psychopathy, but did nothing of the sort. It only made the faux brother's character seem slighter by his casual dismissal from Daniel's life. Also, the tale is both too linear and too sparse in development to have any real poesy. It relies not on characterization but grotesques- they aren't even caricatures. And, after the first fifteen minutes, I kept wondering what a real visionary director like Theo Angelopoulos or Michelangelo Antonioni would have done with this film's premise- even its footage, for quality editing could have severely tightened the film up, and made it less dependent upon overwrought theatrics. In essence, one can tell this was a Hollywood film, even from the first minutes of silence.There Will Be Blood attempts to be epic, great, and tie in with the current political zeitgeist by showing viewers the beginnings of what caused global warming. Instead, it is a meandering tale that relies on soap operatic tricks (such as Bandy's blackmailing Daniel into Eli's church- why?) that don't even have a payoff, however cheap; as well as being dull and poor in almost every filmic aspect (not unlike its twinned, wildly overpraised critical cousin, the Coen Brothers' No Country For Old Men). That this film got so raved over as a great piece of cinema shows how little critics and filmgoers today understand real art and/or care about it. Which scenario is worse is open for debate.

1124270,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B00104QSOM,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[1, 3]","Paul Thomas Anderson's film adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel,Oil!is a somber masterpiece. There Will Be Blood is a fascinating examination of mankind's descent into madness, greed and zealotry. But rather than being heavy-handed or pretentious, the film is subtle, ironic and darkly humorous. It's not often that you see an American film that so skillfully balances these themes without being tainted by political partiality. Nor has there been a film in recent years that so rightly caused controversy. And yet I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be affected by it... or to forget it.As viewers, we are first introduced to Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) while he's working as a miner in 1898. Soon after his interests turn to oil. From the onset we can see that he is a single-minded, determined man of an unusual nature. His main concern in life isn't himself, or his workers, or even his own son. His only care is his business and even that he pursues with seeming indifference. Daniel is not an emotive individual. He's coldly ambitious and the only evidence of his feeling human emotion at all is his explosive anger. But Daniel hides his temperament from the people he scams. He uses his son as a mascot, promoting a fabricated image of a family run business. He unrelentingly pursues landowners with a confidence that borders on egomaniacal. Still, he isn't a monster... yet. When a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) claims that his family farm has oil that seeps through the ground, Daniel is at first skeptical of a man who appears so earnest. Paul intends to be paid for his information and he doesn't care if his family loses money to Plainview. This suits Daniel well (opportunism and industry went hand in hand in the early 20th century). Daniel and his son, H.W. arrive in Paul's small town where they meet the Sunday family. Their son Eli, Paul's identical twin brother, is a preacher of a fanatical Evangelist cult and he's reluctant to allow his family to sell their land to Daniel. He can see that Daniel is a successful man and that he may be able to profit from Daniel's keen sense of business. The pairing of these two men, both dangerously greedy and prideful, leads to a dramatic confrontation. Eli says that God will curse the oil well unless Daniel pays tribute to the church and allows Eli to bless the derrick. When Daniel dismisses Eli disaster strikes and H.W. suffers the consequences. Before long a stranger shows up in town declaring that he's Daniel's long lost brother. But he is not what he seems and Daniel's discovery of this brings him to the precipice of insanity and pushes him over the edge. His combined guilt for his mistakes with H.W., his all-consuming hatred of Eli and his blind ambition lead him to a horrific finale. The last scene of the film is an electrifying and unsettling culmination of one man's journey into madness.This film isn't for everyone. I loved it but I enjoy stories told from the dark depths of the human psyche. The film isn't as violent as the title implies but it is shocking and disturbing.

1124272,A51IK68MWKV5R,B00104QSOM,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[3, 7]","I went into There Will Be Blood expecting a solid movie, but nothing on the scale writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson delivers. I enjoyed Magnolia and especially Boogie Nights for various reasons (often despite their flaws), but in those films, Anderson seemed to be merely following the multiple-character trail Robert Altman blazed many years before. This film really feels like a truly original story by a much more mature storyteller.In addition to the terrific acting from star Daniel Day Lewis (and to a lesser extent, Paul Dano in a dual role), there were two major plusses about this movie. First, that I had no idea where the story was going. In an age where it seems that one movie is pretty much like another, this is a welcome surprise.The second additional plus was the terrific modern-classical score from Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood (including portions of his Popcorn Superhet Receiver). It is the first in recent memory that both calls unnecessary attention to itself (mostly due to its use of dissonance during particularly dramatic scenes) and remains true to the film.Most of the time, when I notice that I'm hearing a score, it's because it's particularly bad. A good score, most of the time, should be like a good editor: if they're doing their job, you won't notice them. But Greenwood's music outdoes itself on both fronts, making the music from There Will Be Blood also the first score since Danny Elfman's peak in the early 1990s that I am actually considering purchasing on CD.",5,Paul Thomas Anderson grows up,1210032000,"05 6, 2008",2008,1504,"['went', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'expecting', 'solid', 'movie', 'nothing', 'scale', 'writer/director', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'delivers', 'enjoyed', 'Magnolia', 'especially', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'various', 'reasons', 'often', 'flaws', 'films', 'Anderson', 'seemed', 'be', 'merely', 'following', 'multiple-character', 'trail', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'blazed', 'many', 'years', 'before', 'film', 'really', 'truly', 'original', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'storyteller.In', 'addition', 'terrific', 'acting', 'star', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'dual', 'role', 'were', 'two', 'major', 'plusses', 'movie', 'First', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'age', 'where', 'one', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'welcome', 'surprise.The', 'second', 'additional', 'plus', 'was', 'terrific', 'modern-classical', 'score', 'Radiohead', 'Jonny', 'Greenwood', 'including', 'portions', 'Popcorn', 'Superhet', 'Receiver', 'first', 'recent', 'memory', 'calls', 'unnecessary', 'attention', 'mostly', 'due', 'use', 'dissonance', 'particularly', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'true', 'film.Most', 'time', 'when', 'notice', ""'m"", 'hearing', 'score', 'particularly', 'bad', 'good', 'score', 'most', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'editor', ""'re"", 'doing', 'job', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Greenwood', 'music', 'fronts', 'making', 'music', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'also', 'first', 'score', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'peak', 'early', '1990s', 'am', 'actually', 'considering', 'purchasing', 'CD']",There Will Be Blood
1124273,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00104QSOM,Craig Matteson,"[9, 13]","I do not regard this as a great film.  Nor do I understand why Daniel Day-Lewis, a fine actor, won the Academy Award for impersonating John Huston's performance diction flawlessly.  But there you go.  People rave about this film and Day-Lewis won the Oscar(tm).  If you look back over the history of these awards you will find a lot of head scratchers that must have made a lot more sense in their time than they do today.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview who is a monster.  In retrospect, the world this character inhabited would have been much better off if he had simply died in the pit we see him working in at the beginning of the movie.  Plainview is a man driven by a soul emptying hatred of everything and everyone which must arise from the same regard for himself.  He is a solitary man whose only appetite is to build his business and make money so, as he later says, he can get away from everything.  We see him make no friends, he has not a single woman in his life (nor are there many female roles in the movie).  He acquires his son when a hand dies in a pit.  Rather than send the kid to relatives, he takes him on as a prop so when he tells farmers and investors that he is a family man with family feelings he has some evidence.How he treats the boy, H. W. he is called, shows how conflicted Daniel is.  He shows genuine delight in teaching the boy his trade and demonstrating his prowess in front of him.  But when the boy is made deaf in an explosion at a well, Daniel sends him off in a very cruel fashion because his value as a prop is diminished.  However, I think it is also because a deaf son can't fully share his world.  It is interesting that they never try to communicate by writing to each other.  Was the boy not taught to read or write?  An indication of this comes when someone claiming to be Daniel's half-brother shows up.  H.W. looks at pictures in the man's diary but holds the book so the writing is upside down and he never looks at it or turns it around to read it.The central conflict in the movie is Daniel's lifelong conflict with Eli Sunday, a religious zealot whose entire ambition centers on building his Church of the Third Revelation.  Daniel came to the Sunday land because Eli's twin brother Paul told him about the easy oil there.  Daniel paid him and then found a way to pay Eli's father, Abel Sunday (significance in the name? The innocent victim?), quail money (as Daniel told H.W.) instead of oil money.  You see, Daniel came to the land with H.W. posing as a man interesting in quail hunting rather than admitting he was looking for oil.  Daniel demonstrates his ability to make bitter enemies needlessly when Eli tries to strong arm his way to bless the new well.  Instead, Daniel introduces Eli's sister and blesses the well himself.  Later, Eli finds a way to humiliate Daniel (to be fair, he uses the same method to humiliate each convert).  At the end of the movie, Daniel returns the insult.But the grimness of the movie and Daniel's inability to allow anyone to exist outside of his own universe of dominance is a horror.  He commits tremendous emotional and/or physical violence against anyone who fails to stay within the bounds he has determined for them in his own warped mind and empty soul.  The problem is that this is a character who is so sick in the soul that he is mostly useless in telling anything but a singular horror story.  Do the writers suppose that all oil men or business men are possessed of this sickness?  I can't believe they would buy into such a childish notion.  Nearly every business person I know enjoys their success, using their work to improve the lives of others, and has great friendships.  Yes, there are exceptions, but not to the cartoonish extremes of Plainview.The film also wears its artiness on its sleeve.  Like a lot of middle-brow movies pretending to be high-brow art, they are clever with some interesting elements that invite a level of thought that the viewer can congratulate himself (or herself) for formulating.  However, the movie is just too ham fisted and unrealistic to be high art.  Since there are long stretches without dialog and the images during those stretches don't really do much, the musical score provides us with strong and loud cues telling us when to be disoriented, anxious, and so forth.  It isn't that the music selected isn't interestingly done, but that it doesn't form a unity and is far too obvious in its intention to be an artistic achievement.  It is more like advertising or melodrama in purpose even if the music itself is drawn from actual musical artworks.  One doesn't congratulate a commercial for using Beethoven by calling it art.Daniel finally gets his riches and builds a huge empty mansion that is more prison than palace.  He has all the trappings of luxury, but no appetite to enjoy them (he uses one main hall and his artifacts for target practice) and no friends to share them with.  When the adult and married H.W. wants to strike out on his own, Daniel responds with hatred, cruelty, and demonstrates how his emptiness of soul creates a world destroying vacuum for everyone unfortunate enough to come in contact with him.  At the end the conflict between Eli and Daniel becomes ridiculously horrible and the movie simply ends rather than show us Daniel either facing the consequences of his brutality or escaping them.For me, this was a grim film that was so unpleasant that I never want to see it again and recommend that you don't even bother with it.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",2,"Grim, cartoonish, and

Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood""(in my personal opinion)is a masterpiece! Now I'm not the most educated reviewer here on amazon so I speak for myself and do not intend to push on you what you should think about this film(or any film for that matter). For me the story that is being told  is always very important, but never as important as the way in wich the storyteller chooses to tell it. ""There Will Be Blood"" is a brilliant example of a director taking a ordinary tale of good old american greed and turning it into an extraordinary tale of how the darkness of the human soul tends to destroy the lighter more intelegent side. This is no ""good guy, bad guy"" movie. This is real life where everyone has a good and bad side and(I quote Daniel Plainview)where religion is nothing but a superstition. This is a place where power cries out to the ugly side of life and money pumps the veins and keeps our 75% souless existance moving foward and will surely be the reason for our demise. It seems a few reviewers here at amazon pretty much(in so many words)believe that they would have made a better movie than P.T. Anderson but to each is there own.

1124276,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00104QSOM,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 3]","Having been praised for his Altmanesque work on such multi-character and interweaving storyline films as Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Paul Thomas Anderson has set out for completely new territory, and the results, while not necessarily commercially palatable for mainstream audiences, is a unique tale of greed, power, and the loss of one's soul in There Will Be Blood.  Adapted loosely from Upton Sinclair's novel, Oil, this is truly a labor of love by Anderson, who has elicited a stunning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis.A struggling oil miner in 1898, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), slaves away on a dig until it begins to yield oil.  Years later, he raises a child as his son amid the rural setting and buys oil fields while paying little or nothing for them.  One day a stranger, Paul, offers to sell his family's land knowing there is some oil.  Plainview sets forth to this property in the guise of a hunter and makes an offer to the religious family.  The elder son, Paul's brother Eli (Paul Dano), is mistrustful.  Eventually Plainview gets his land, begins to pump oil, and coddles the locals in a public relations sleight of hand.  Although not a religious man, he subjugates his convictions to secure needed land rights.  As Eli becomes a rising force of religious zeal, Daniel becomes a wealthy oil baron.  Enter a mysterious man who has family ties to Plainview, and the quest for money and power takes on another aspect that complicates matters.  Plainview's thirst for oil will stop at nothing until he is eaten away to a vindictive, monstrous self, setting the stage for a macabre reunion with an old face.This is a slice of the industrial revolution and the horrors of quality control in keeping with author Sinclair's The Jungle. The period setting, with its raw, forbidding environment and dangerous existence, is vividly realized.  This was a time where greedy men dealt with their own kind for personal gain, and women stood their place.  Its antecedents are other similarly themed films like Giant, Greed, and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, while it's lack of warmth and stark visuals would have impressed director Stanley Kubrick.  It was a time where future billionaire's were in the making.  As such it is a fascinating history and culture lesson all at once.  Is this how the West was really won?  Is this the darker side to Manifest Destiny?Aside from watching Plainview's amassing of wealth, the core relationship he has with his son, who witnesses much of his machinations, is an interesting one.  Plainview at times shows paternal affection only to betray any semblance of loyalties and love for the prospect of oil.  In fact, the film is filled with betrayals such as the way Plainview cheats families out of their potential wealth and a gut wrenching scene with his son on a train.  It is a bleak film, but you've got to admire the singular vision with which Anderson and Lewis convey this character.  We are fascinated by Plainview, but we don't have to like him.There is a scene that illustrates Plainview's willingness to sacrifice his beliefs (or non-beliefs) in order to gain more oil fields.  Set in a small church, this baptism scene is the highlight of the film and goes so over the top that it is a hoot.  Further, when Plainview makes a play for land rights among sellers, his pitch becomes canned and rehearsed like a well `oiled' commercial.  He is a selfish con man, a liar, and a cheat.  As much as you want to find something redeeming about him, it never fully emerges.  He is also a most unforgiving and vengeful man in the worst way.Former Oscar winner (My Left Foot) Lewis, like legendary actor Paul Muni, has limited his film output over the years.  That he chose to do this based on Anderson's script speaks highly of the attraction of other high profile stars (e.g. Tom Cruise in Magnolia or Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love).  Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine) is pretty compelling as Eli, quite a weird, and ominous figure.  The cinematography (Robert Elswit) recalls Days of Heaven.  The minimalist score (Jonny Greenwood) is a bit unusual as it almost becomes an accompanying sound effect than theme.The movie does have some impressive, opening minutes that are visual without talking.  Some of the dialogue has a sadistic bite to it while the staging of scenes lends itself to a strong theatricality; despite its wide expanse of land setting, it has a claustrophobic feel.  The pace of the film, which may test the audience's patience, is quite deliberate and almost slows to a halt, but Lewis surprises and fascinates at every turn.  Watch out for the bizarre ending which may perplex some viewers.  Although some may not appreciate it, others will simply relish this informal history lesson in the making of a turn-of-the-century mogul as personified by an acting giant who is about to add another gold statuette to his collection.",4,Oil and Family in THERE WILL BE BLOOD,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,4902,"['Having', 'been', 'praised', 'Altmanesque', 'work', 'such', 'multi-character',

All three features long steadicam takes, raw and blunt Oscar worthy performances, 70's glamour setting, full of neon lights (true for both 'Boogie Nights' and 'Casino') and underrated protagonists (Mark Wahlberg, Ray Liotta and Bob De Niro)'Magnolia' would be PT's attempt to be like his idol Robert Altman and this would be his ""Short Cuts'. Taking place in a single location and 9 different people with their own individual lives that somehow are intertwined through divine intervention (death, raining frogs, freak accidents, etc.)Finally, 'There Will Be Blood' can be viewed in many perspectives. It could be PT Anderson's take on a period piece - Scorsese style - 'Gangs of New York'. Hell, even Daniel Day Lewis' performance in that is just a rehearshal for this film. But I dare say it's more Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven'. 'There Will Be Blood' is biblically epic in proportion and filled with allusions to Christian themes.Daniel Plainview can be viewed as a very flawed human being. A rouge and a knave no doubt, but still very much human with very human needs and desires. One can understand the pressure and the power that could bring about one's downfall. For a man to degenerate to that level of insanity at the end of the film goes to show how much money can be the root of evil and how it could corrupt the very essence of one's soul.Daniel Plainview does not hesitate to murder anyone who gets in his way. By the end of the film, he had murdered two people (an imposter posing as his long lost brother and Eli Sunday, a devious bible-thumping scumbag). But he destroyed many more lives along the way. Most notable of all, his adopted son.Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of the man is short of perfection. He can be too 'showy' at times and I believe he may have gone too far in his method acting. Paul Dano shines in playing two characters, both identical twins. His sermons were described as being fanatical bordering on dogmatic zealousness and also betrayal. Both characters' fates are intertwined with each other. Both were trying to rip each other off and by the end of the film, trying to literally 'screw' each other up. But of course, guess who got the upper hand?Say what you will with about this film. Plainview is beyond redemption, so is Eli Sunday, as he remained incorrigible and devious right to the very end. This is one fine film with fine period detail and shots of wide plains of early 20th century America that harkens back to 'Days of Heaven'.",5,PT Anderson's Days of Heaven (Spoilers within!),1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,2718,"['one', 'were', 'reflect', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'PT', 'Anderson', 'filmography', 'other', 'directors', 'would', 'have', 'say', ""'Boogie"", 'Nights', 'would', 'be', 'PT', 'Anderson', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'glitzy', 'glamarous', 'gangster', 'epics', ""'Goodfellas"", ""'Casino"", 'three', 'features', 'long', 'steadicam', 'raw', 'blunt', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performances', '70', 'glamour', 'setting', 'full', 'neon', 'lights', 'true', ""'Boogie"", 'Nights', ""'Casino"", 'underrated', 'protagonists', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Bob', 'De', 'Niro', 'would', 'be', 'PT', 'attempt', 'be', 'idol', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'would', 'be', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'Taking', 'place', 'single', 'location', '9', 'different', 'people', 'own', 'individual', 'somehow', 'are', 'intertwined', 'divine', 'intervention', 'death', 'raining', 'frogs', 'freak', 'accidents', 'etc', 'Finally', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'many', 'perspectives', 'could', 'be', 'PT', 'Anderson', 'take', 'period', 'piece', 'Scorsese', 'style', ""'Gangs"", 'New', 'York', 'Hell', 'even', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'performance', 'just', 'rehearshal', 'film', 'dare', 'say', 'more', 'Terrence', 'Malick', ""'Days"", 'Heaven', ""'There"", 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'biblically', 'epic', 'proportion', 'filled', 'allusions', 'Christian', 'themes.Daniel', 'Plainview', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'very', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'rouge', 'knave', 'doubt', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'human', 'very', 'human', 'needs', 'desires', 'One', 'can', 'understand', 'pressure', 'power', 'could', 'bring', 'about', 'one', 'downfall', 'man', 'degenerate', 'level', 'insanity', 'end', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'can', 'be', 'root', 'evil', 'how', 'could', 'corrupt', 'very', 'essence', 'one', 'soul.Daniel', 'Plainview', 'not', 'hesitate', 'murder', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'had', 'murdered', 'two', 'people', 'imposter', 'posing', 'long', 'lost', 'brother', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'devious', 'bible-thumping', 'scumbag', 'destroyed', 'many', 'more', 'lives', 'way', 'Most', 'notable', 'adopted', 'son.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'portrayal', 'man', 'short', 'perfection', 'can', 'be', 'too', ""'showy"", 'times', 'believe', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'method', 'acting', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'shines', 'playing', 'two', 'characters', 'identical', 'twins', 'sermons', 'were', 'described', 'being', 'fanatical', 'bordering', 'dogmatic', 'zealousness', 'also', 'betrayal', 'characters', 'fates', 'are', 'intertwined', 'other', 'were', 'trying', 'rip', 'other', 'end', 'film', 'trying', 'literally', ""'screw"", 'other', 'up', 'course', 'guess', 'who', 'got', 'upper', 'hand', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'film', 'Plainview', 'redemption', 'so', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'remained', 'incorrigible', 'devious', 'right', 'very', 'end', 'one', 'fine', 'film', 'fine', 'period', 'detail', 'shots', 'wide', 'plains', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'America', 'back', ""'Days"", 'Heaven']",There Will Be Blood

Therefore, I will keep this review short and re-review the film after I watch it sober.  The one element that stood out the most to me was the amazing performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, which I definitely would consider as the leading performance of the year.  Lewis's ability to immerse himself in the mind of his character seems to me nearly unprecedented for a leading man.  Sure, a lot of actors play a variety of roles and do well in them.  Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Jack Nicholson, etc. are all good examples.  However, although these talented performers play different roles on paper, they seem to be playing the same character on the screen.  In other words, they play their own personalities and selling points more than they play the character; instead of utterly transforming themselves into the character, they place their own personalities in the role and situation of the character.Daniel Day-Lewis, however, is completely different.  Watch ANY movie that he is in and compare it to ANY other movie.  He is COMPLETELY different in every role, and when I say different, I mean that sometimes its even difficult to tell that it is him performing.  He seems to lose his sense of personality to the point where I don't even know what Daniel Day-Lewis's actual personality is like: He just embodies his characters at every possible level.

1124284,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00104QSOM,DanD,"[5, 6]","I'm not sure where to begin this review.  I usually start with a summary of whatever I'm reviewing (movie, book, CD), and then go into my thoughts on it.  But how do I summarize this movie?  Daniel Plainview becomes an oil man and is determined to keep his position, no matter what the cost?  Anyone who's seen this film can tell you that such a statement barely summarizes the plot of ""There Will Be Blood.""The movie isn't really about plot, anyways.  I mean, it's there, yes; it's a hell of a story, loosely based upon Upton Sinclair's outstanding 1927 effort, ""Oil!"".  But even ""Oil!"" wasn't so much about plot as it was about a social concern (as were most, if not all, of Sinclair's novels).  ""There Will Be Blood"" (it is definitely Paul Thomas Andeson's movie; he wrote it, he directed it; it doesn't feel much like an adaptation at all) is more about humanity, about one character's ""growth"" (I use the term lightly) as he succumbs further and further to his greed.  Daniel Plainview, as portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis (who thoroughly deserves the Best Actor trophy he took home for this), is a downright evil man.  We are given little motivation for his evil (aside from greed; but we all suffer from that, don't we?) nor should we be given one.  I have heard people complain that the movie is dark, that it is uncomfortable to watch, that it has no redeeming features.  This is all true--thank God.  It is an honest portrayal of a dishonest man, and never once succumbs to the pressure to be a box office sensational feel-good film.I should say a little bit about other aspects of the movie, although if you've already seen it then such a rehash is pointless, and if you're curious about watching it you're already convinced one way or the other.  Paul Dano, as Plainview's ""nemesis"" (be warned: such terminology does not apply in a film such as this), is a wonder as always.  Why I've never heard of him, outside of ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" I do not know, and is something I aim to rectify.  Kevin J. O'Connor, as Plainview's long-lost brother, is impressive; we can forgive him his turn as the comic relief in cheesy-yet-enjoyable horror fare such as ""Van Helsing"" and ""The Mummy.""  Dillon Feasier, as Plainview's adoptive son, is mesmerizing; it's rare you find a child actor with that much depth.  The scenery also becomes a star of the film; shot in part where the recent ""No Country For Old Men"" was filmed (Anderson and the Coen Brothers would occasionally disrupt one another's filming), the landscape awes and captivates.  The musical score underlies the depth of the film--something that's been rare in Hollywood, though as of late has been making something of a comeback.Have you made up your mind yet?  I can't blame you if you don't feel like seeing this movie; I was skeptical myself at first.  Even after the film, I had to think a while.  It wasn't until after a month or so that I decided that not only did I enjoy this movie, but that it is one of my favorites.  It's not an easy thing to watch, I'll admit.

Clendenin,"[1, 3]","This film is almost three hours long, and there's not a word of dialogue for the first fifteen minutes, but I could barely believe it when the credits rolled. Based upon the novel Oil! (1927) by Upton Sinclair, the film is set in the wild California frontier at the end of the 19th and beginning of the early twentieth-centuries. Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Daniel Plainview, a silver miner who discovers crude oil on his land, and Paul Dano, who plays a preacher named Eli Sunday who sells rights to the oil on his family's property in order to help his church. Playview and Sunday become moral rivals, and thirty years later, at the end of the film, both characters have been deeply corrupted. Plainview goes mad, whereas Eli admits that he's a fake and God doesn't exist. In an important sub-plot, Plainview's adopted son lives under his father's very dark shadow, and declares at the end of the film, ""I thank God I have none of you in me."" Plainview's own last words are a confessional understatement: ""I'm finished.""

This film takes the cakes, in my opinion.

I have hunch that the folks who disliked ""There Will Be Blood"" just never knew any really scary guys like Plainview.  Probably didn't have a Plainview in the family.  No Plainview as a dad, for example.  I imagine it's possible, these days, to grow up and never have to deal with a guy like Plainview in a real life-or-death (or dishonor) type of situation in the middle of blazing hot stinking desert with no way out.  Today, we hose down Saddam's palace with a machine gun and fix our lipstick.  Hoo-ah.  That's scary but it's not the kind of scary that this film celebrates.  This is movie about the demons of the masculine world.  If you ain't seen any of them, then bless your little heart.  You are very fortunate.  You won't understand anything about Plainview because he's from another planet.  You'll sit there trying to figure out when somebody REAL is going to appear.  You'll just throw up your hands in frustration at this weird caricature of a greedy and hateful man.So, it's cool.  You didn't grow up around a Plainview.  You didn't live in a time when the Plainviews made a living out of solid rock with their bare hands.  You haven't seen that, and you don't understand it, and that's probably a good thing.

1124287,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B00104QSOM,Danny G.,"[3, 6]","There's one central theme that runs through the Daniel Day Lewis character's life: financial success at any cost! He wrecks every human relationship in his adult life. He destroys his health! He suppresses his sexuality. (It's obvious he's gay since he shows zero interest in women.) But he can't let any intimate relationships get in the way of success! He rejects his only son over something so trivial it would be laughable under different circumstances. He admits he's full of hate but does nothing to rid himself of such feelings. He even rejects God and all religion - because he believes in nothing but himself, which is a recipe for disaster!Unfortunately, he's a perfect example of the Protestant Work Ethic. He works hard, very hard. He has the single-minded determination to become successful. He's intelligent and knows how to manage people. He's well spoken and very clever. He successfully manipulates both church and the local community to do his bidding. But in the process he damages the natural environment in orders to make his wealth. He steals from others because he can get away with it. He uses an innocent child to gain leverage with those around him. Literally anything goes in order to be a financial success.False religion is the other side of this story's coin. Again the Protestant Work ethic is portrayed as doing whatever it takes in order to succeed. This time it's a preacher who has his eye on the big time. He too knows how to manipulate people to get the wealth and power he wants. While he does not kill anyone like the self-made business man does, and certainly does not deserves his fate, all God means to him is a way of making great wealth. In the end, when that wealth fails him, he admits for the very first time what a foul human being he truly is!This is a very dark cautionary tale about the destructive power of greed and believing in ""the ends justify the means!"" What makes this tale so incredibly sad is that the preacher's and the business man's life could have turned out so differently if they did not allow themselves to become so profoundly corrupt. These two men did not have to become evil in the end! They could have used their success to the benefit of others - something they apparently never learned how to do! But all they cared about was themselves, which, in the end, led to their mutual destruction!See:Age of Greed: The Triumph of Finance and the Decline of America, 1970 to the Present (Vintage)andOne Simple Act: Discovering the Power of Generosity",5,What A Scathing Indictment of Capitalism and False Religion!

Wend,"[5, 7]","I must confess that I had high expectations prior to seeing There Will Be Blood, and from the previews I expected Daniel Day-Lewis' character to be much more violent that he proved to be.  This film is an amazing tour-de-force for Mr. Day-Lewis; he is on screen in almost every scene and so absorbed into Daniel Plainview that you forget this is acting.  Plainview is a man who not only distrusts the world but has nothing but suspicious contempt for those around him.  Paradoxically, he wants to portray himself as a family man and palms off the child of one of his deceased workers as his son (nicely played by Dillon Freasier).  He cares nothing about having a family but reacts violently to the mere suggestion that he is less than a perfect parent.Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is so large that it tends to dominate those of his fellow-actors but Paul Dano as Eli Sunday, the local preacher of the Church of the Third Resurrection is equally amazing.  Like Plainfield, Eli is performing for the local townspeople and there is a fiery scene where Eli casts out a ""ghost"" that is giving elderly woman arthritis.  An interesting performance is turned in by Kevin J. O'connor as Plainview's presumed long-lost half-brother.  The meekness of O'Connor's performance is quite a contract to Day-Lewis' and for a moment in the film Plainview has somebody who he really believes to be family and gives him a job.  Cairn Hinds has a small role as Plainview's right-hand man, the one he sends on errands he does not want to do and, unfortunately does not have enough screen time.The film begins with no dialogue for several minutes as we watch Day-Lewis digging what seems to be his first oil well alone, gradually changing into a scene years later where he has a small crew of workers. The music by Jonny Greenwood is quite a pastiche with the music sometimes a bit disruptive and sometimes very interesting. I was a bit puzzled by his use of Violin Concerti by Mendelssohn and Bruch as they did not really fit the scene for me.I have read comments on how There Will Be Blood is the first great American film of this century but I think the statement is overblown.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson has crafted a truly gripping film but it is very limited in scope. The film is marvelous in depicting the mistrust Plainview has for the world and everyone in it but there is little character development and I found the film on the long side, wondering how the story was going to wrap up.

This film is a brilliant, if unusual character study.  The first thing anyone should notice about this film(besides Daniel Day's oscar winning performance) is the soundtrack by Johnny Greenwood.  It is easily the best score of the year, and immediately distinguishes this film.  The first twenty minutes are without any dialogue, and it is to the score's credit that it engages the audience so much.  Then there is Daniel Day Lewis.  He enthralls for every second of the film's admittedly long runtime.  He is terrifying, funny, and fascinating to watch.  Overall this film may not be mainstream, but it is never boring.  It was easily one of the top ten films of 2007 and well worth a rental or even a blind buy.",5,"May not be the most mainstream film, but a brilliant one",1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,827,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'having', 'one', 'negative', 'review', 'amazon', 'was', 'right', 'so', 'i', 'feel', 'should', 'put', 'thoughts', 'film', 'brilliant', 'unusual', 'character', 'study', 'first', 'thing', 'anyone', 'should', 'notice', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'soundtrack', 'Johnny', 'Greenwood', 'easily', 'best', 'score', 'year', 'immediately', 'film', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'dialogue', 'score', 'credit', 'audience', 'so', 'much', 'Then', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'second', 'film', 'admittedly', 'long', 'runtime', 'terrifying', 'funny', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Overall', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'mainstream', 'never', 'boring', 'was', 'easily', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'films', '2007', 'well', 'rental', 'even', 'blind', 'buy']",There Will Be Blood
1124294,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00104QSOM,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 2]","Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, a simple oil man.  He started off very rough, alone dealing with the discomfort and pain of digging holes in order to obtain the lubricating riches of Texas tea.  As his business began to grew, he received a tip that would have him drilling for oil in a desolate village where he has to associate, nay, negotiate with devoted Christians like a claimed prophet named Eli Sunday (Paul Dino) in order to accomplish his mission.  He treated this business like a family business, as seen with his son H.W. Plainview, but he never felt so isolated.  Like business, his own greed has grown, becoming mean and distrusting others, even his own kin; turns out he's not really a simple man.  Spanning over 20 years in the early 1900s, it's a progress of Daniel being a wealthy oil businessman but so has his cold self-being, and what can be said of the aftermath is this..."" There Will Be Blood.""There are a lot of positive things to say about his role (Oscar-worthy; marvelous; captivating), but it's easy to say Day-Lewis is the right man for this character.  Day-Lewis is known for being a picky actor, but he usually makes the right choice on film roles, and he certainly made a great one here, for his role entices on brutal charisma.  Daniel Plainview was selfish, deceitful & malevolent and Day-Lewis brought these characteristics to the film with such depth that it's not easy to hate the character.  He also has this intimidating aura that even when he doesn't lift a finger, his presence can be threatening.""There Will Be Blood"" is simply great, no way around it.  Director P.T. Anderson crafted a visceral delight unlike his early multi-character films, emphasizing on only one person to carry the weight for about 2 1/2 hours.  It's a long film, but the main character constantly brings something new to the table, whether it's negotiating for his business or being baptized for buying land; it doesn't feel like the film drags.  Other than Day-Lewis, the rest of the cast are pretty good.  Not sure about Paul Dino as the preacher, but I think he pulled it off, as is the kid who played H.W. Plainview who grew up with his share of unfortunates.  The film looks as beautiful as it is ugly; I like the locations and the sight of the workers in those large oil drilling devices incorporates the danger and grittiness this film shows.Much praise has to be said about the movie's eerie score.  When I saw the movie's trailer, it was the score that made me want to see this film, and Jonny Greenwood made great use of stringed instruments to make the movie sound periodic and menacing.  From the beginning of the film, the music heightens itself to a point of shock; I knew from then I was in for a messy film, and the music accurately fits the film's tone.  I think the score is more terrifying than the movie itself.What surprised me the most about this movie is its rating, because despite being R-rated for violence and being an otherwise brutal film, there is hardly any graphic violence. Most of the violent parts appear accidental, and one scene regarding a use of a handgun isn't as bad as you see in a PG-13 action film.  In fact, the only graphic scene worthy of this movie's rating is the last scene of the film, and personally, it made a symbolic point of this movie's themes.  In a field of enterprise and religion, there's never room for both of them and the sins of trade can never be lost to faith.  And that whoever came up with the movie title has a sense of humor.",5,Business vs. Church: A Slippery Bout,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,3518,"['Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'simple', 'oil', 'man', 'started', 'off', 'very', 'rough', 'alone', 'dealing', 'discomfort', 'pain', 'digging', 'holes', 'order', 'obtain', 'lubricating', 'riches', 'Texas', 'tea', 'business', 'began', 'grew', 'received', 'tip', 'would', 'have', 'drilling', 'oil', 'desolate', 'village', 'where', 'associate', 'nay', 'negotiate', 'devoted', 'Christians', 'claimed', 'prophet', 'named', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'Paul', 'Dino', 'order', 'accomplish', 'mission', 'treated', 'business', 'family', 'business', 'seen', 'son', 'H.W', 'Plainview', 'never', 'felt', 'so', 'isolated', 'business', 'own', 'greed', 'grown', 'becoming', 'mean', 'distrusting', 'others', 'even', 'own', 'kin', 'out', 'not', 'really', 'simple', 'man', 'Spanning', '20', 'years', 'early', '1900s', 'progress', 'Daniel', 'being', 'wealthy', 'oil', 'businessman', 'so', 'cold', 'self-being', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'aftermath', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'are', 'lot', 'positive', 'things', 'say', 'role', 'Oscar-worthy', 'marvelous', 'captivating', 'easy', 'say', 'Day-Lewis', 'right', 'man', 'character', 'Day-Lewis', 'known', 'being', 'picky', 'actor', 'usually', 'right', 'choice', 'film', 'roles', 'certainly', 'made', 'great', 'one', 'here', 'role', 'entices', 'brutal', 'charisma', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'was', 'selfish', 'deceitful', 'malevolent', 'Day-Lewis', 'brought', 'characteristics', 'film', 'such', 'depth', 'not', 'easy', 'hate', 'character', 'also', 'intimidating', 'aura', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'lift', 'finger', 'presence', 'can', 'be', 'threatening', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'simply', 'great', 'way', 'Director', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'crafted', 'visceral', 'delight', 'early', 'multi-character', 'films', 'emphasizing', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'carry', 'weight', 'about', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'long', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'constantly', 'something', 'new', 'table', 'negotiating', 'business', 'being', 'baptized', 'buying', 'land', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'drags', 'Other', 'Day-Lewis', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Not', 'sure', 'Paul', 'Dino', 'preacher', 'think', 'pulled', 'off', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'H.W', 'Plainview', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'share', 'unfortunates', 'film', 'as', 'beautiful', 'ugly', 'like', 'locations', 'sight', 'workers', 'large', 'oil', 'drilling', 'devices', 'danger', 'grittiness', 'film', 'shows.Much', 'praise', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'eerie', 'score', 'When', 'saw', 'movie', 'trailer', 'was', 'score', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'Jonny', 'Greenwood', 'made', 'great', 'use', 'stringed', 'instruments', 'make', 'movie', 'sound', 'periodic', 'menacing', 'beginning', 'film', 'music', 'point', 'shock', 'knew', 'then', 'was', 'messy', 'film', 'music', 'accurately', 'film', 'tone', 'think', 'score', 'more', 'terrifying', 'movie', 'itself.What', 'surprised', 'most', 'movie', 'rating', 'being', 'R-rated', 'violence', 'being', 'otherwise', 'brutal', 'film', 'hardly', 'graphic', 'violence', 'Most', 'violent', 'parts', 'appear', 'accidental', 'one', 'scene', 'regarding', 'use', 'handgun', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'see', 'PG-13', 'action', 'film', 'fact', 'only', 'graphic', 'scene', 'worthy', 'movie', 'rating', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'personally', 'made', 'symbolic', 'point', 'movie', 'themes', 'field', 'enterprise', 'religion', 'never', 'room', 'sins', 'trade', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'lost', 'faith', 'came', 'up', 'movie', 'title', 'sense', 'humor']",There Will Be Blood

1124297,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B00104QSOM,D. Hartley,"[3, 5]","In the audacious opening shot of his magnificent, sprawling, demented epic, ""There Will Be Blood"", director P.T. Anderson presents us with a tracking shot of a vast expanse of rocky, desolate scrub land, scored by an ominous, discordant drone. When the camera (literally) disappears down a hole, we are introduced to the story's protagonist, a lone, shadowy figure, chiseling away at the subterranean rock wall of a derelict well with a fierce, single-minded determination. There is nary a word of dialogue uttered during the ensuing 15 minutes or so of screen time; yet through the masterful implementation of purely cinematic language, we are given a sufficient enough glimpse so as to feel that we may already have some inkling of what it is that drives this man, even though we do not yet even know his name. Stylistically, this scene is more than a little reminiscent of the prologue for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". What we witness in the film's introduction may not be quite as profound or seminal as Kubrick's rendering of ""the dawn of man"", but it does put the spotlight on something just as primeval. It is something that is buried deep within the capitalist DNA-the relentless drive to amass wealth and power through willful exploitation and opportunism (hey, don't knock it- it's what made this country great!)Flash forward a few years, and we find that our mystery man not only has a name, but has made a name for himself in the midst of California's turn-of-the-century oil boom. The ambitious Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) has moved up from prospecting for precious metals to leasing tracts of land for the oil drilling rights. He is well on his way to becoming a very wealthy man. He did not get to this place in his life by being a nice guy (who does?). He is a bachelor; but in order to give an impression as a sincere ""family man"", he totes a young orphan along to business meetings, who he introduces as his son (not unlike Ryan and Tatum O'Neal's con artist team in ""Paper Moon""). In his worldview, you are either with him, or you are his ""competitor"". In fact, Plainview is the quintessential lone wolf, having very little tolerance or use for people in general, unless they can help him further his agenda.Plainview's biggest payday arrives in the form of a furtive and enigmatic young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), who walks out of the desert one day with a hot tip about a possible oil field that lies beneath his family's central California ranch land. Everything appears to be going swimmingly until Plainview crosses paths with Sunday's twin brother Eli (also played by Dano) a fire and brimstone evangelical who sees his family's business partnership with Plainview as a potential cash cow for building up his ministry. The relationship between these two characters forms the heart of the story's conflict.Plainview and Sunday are in reality two peas in a pod; they both employ their own fashion of charlatanism and manipulation to get what they want. They circle each other warily, grudgingly accepting that they need each other to achieve their goals. Plainview sees himself as an empire builder, and promises the milk and honey of economic prosperity to sway the landowners to his way of thinking. The somewhat unhinged Sunday envisions himself as a prophet, and uses the lure of eternal life and the theatrics of faith healing to win over his followers. He clearly sees (plainly views?) Plainview as the Devil; this is proffered by the director in one of the film's most stunning visual moments, where Anderson frames Day-Lewis in ominous silhouette against the hellish backdrop of an oil well fire, recalling the image of Chernabog in the ""Night on Bald Mountain"" segment from ""Fantasia"". I also think it is significant to note that when we are first introduced to Plainview, he emerges from underground (the Underworld?). The resulting confilict between prophet and profiteer makes for a compelling tale.The story spans thirty years; culminating on the eve of the Depression, by which time the obscenely wealthy but completely soulless Plainview has morphed into a reclusive Charles Foster Kane type figure, alone in his mansion. The film's jaw-dropping climatic scene is destined to be dissected and argued over by film buffs for some years to come.The story is rich in allegory; especially in the character of Plainview, who is the very personification of the blood-soaked history of profit-driven expansionism in America (and it goes without saying that the particular brand of puritanical religious zealotry represented by Sunday has been responsible for its fair share of damage throughout U.S. history as well). This film reminded me, oddly enough, of the excellent documentary ""The Corporation"", in which the filmmakers build a psychological profile of the typical corporation, as if it were a person. The summation from that film's official website says:""To assess the `personality' of the corporate `person,' a checklist is employed, using diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization and the standard diagnostic tool of psychiatrists and psychologists. The operational principles of the corporation give it a highly anti-social `personality': it is self-interested, inherently amoral, callous and deceitful; it breaches social and legal standards to get its way; it does not suffer from guilt, yet it can mimic the human qualities of empathy, caring and altruism.""That works for me as a profile of Plainview, and to some extent, Sunday as well. The famously dedicated and meticulous Day-Lewis is nothing short of astonishing in his role. I dare say it is one of his finest performances to date. He does make some interesting choices; especially in his carefully measured vocal inflection. I swear that he is uncannily channeling the voice of the late Jack Palance. But it works-and maybe it's not such a stretch, since director Anderson appears to be channeling the mythic style of George Stevens' westerns (""Giant"", obviously; and in a tangential sense, ""Shane""). Credit must also go to Paul Dano (""Little Miss Sunshine""), who does an admirable job of holding his own against the greatest character actor on earth. In a recent TV interview, Dano said that Day-Lewis never once broke character, even refusing to acknowledge him off-camera.This marks the most cohesive and mature work from director Anderson, who adapted his screenplay from Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"". Anderson's previous films have shown a tendency to polarize critics and audiences. I personally find him one of the most unique American filmmakers working today, and I think that this movie is going to surprise a lot of people. Kudos as well for Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood's soundtrack.",5,Out here in the fields,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,6728,"['audacious', 'opening', 'shot', 'magnificent', 'sprawling',

1124298,AC63924IPU3IS,B00104QSOM,"DKMI ""dkmi""","[17, 25]","I'm shocked to see that the overwhelming majority of reviewers are giving this movie a five star review.  Why?  The movie does look stunning, and the acting of Daniel Day Lewis is superb.  The movie is well done, but the ever important story is not.Lewis' character in this film is Daniel Plainview.  He's a loner and an ambitious beyond belief (really) oil tycoon.  He is evil and somehow gets away with being evil unchallenged by anyone.  He embarasses the town's preacher multiple times, yet no one in the town seems to care.  He kills a man and no one bothers to ask what happened to him.  In the end, he is so drunk that he can hardly stand, yet once he does rise, he drinks a lot more and then is able to chase around a sober man and beat him to death.  These story flaws ruin the movie.  There is very little drama here - just one bad deed by Daniel after another.  No explanation why he is the way he is.  We know nothing of the man even after having to watch him for over 2 1/2 hours other than that he apparently loathes everyone - including himself.The attention to detail was remarkable.

When they got here, I had planned to watch them back to back but I only had time for 1 so I picked Fargo. Partly instinctively (I mean who doesn't love Fargo) and partly cuz it was a gray blustery day outside and Fargo seemed to fit. I thought about it later and I was glad I waited on There Will Be Blood because it's in that category of movie that deserves a certain amount of respect and willingness to gleefully endure an epic because the payoff is so good. Dances With Wolves, Gone With The Wind, Cat On A Hot Tin Roof... You know movies that are best in 1 long sitting with no distractions and preferably alone. Movies like Fargo and Pulp Fiction can be watched in a group or just certain scenes with your pals, and that's great. I mean who doesn't have lines from both of those movies memorized and you say them to a friend... who also love the movie and laughs and says his ""Honey Bunny"" line back to ya. But, movies like this one, get in your head with their slow unwind and great storytelling and they move you through every human emotion without you even realizing they have done it. Acting plays a huge part in this movie cuz neither of the leads could have been played by anyone else. He makes you want to BE an Oil Man... or at least invest in his wells, and the Preacher, Hell, I wanna slap him too.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","When was the last time you saw an actor portray an absolutely vile and reprehensible human being and want to give said actor a standing ovation?  Folks, Daniel Day-Lewis is as brilliant as he is mesmerizing as ambitious oilman Daniel Plainview in THERE WILL BE BLOOD, a powerful film depicting the oil industry in the infancy of the 20th Century.  Over the span of about 30 years, we see Plainview transform from a smooth-talking salesman to a vicious, greedy tycoon; the common theme throughout this transformation is Plainview's utter contempt for his fellow man.  No one--not even his own blood--is worthy, especially if they happen to get in Plainview's way.Day-Lewis is riveting playing such an odious, contemptible character; whether he's feigning compassion or committing cold-blooded crimes he's totally convincing and believable.  This film is a one-man show, as Day-Lewis completely dominates every scene he's in--not in an overbearing manner, but masterfully and brilliantly.  That's not to say the supporting cast isn't up to par, because it is; led by Paul Dano playing a young faith healer with a most annoying girlish scream, the cast augments Day-Lewis's performance.  Honorable mention goes to Kevin J. O'Connor playing Plainview's long lost brother Henry.THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a finely crafted film featuring award-winning cinematography by Robert Elswit and a most haunting musical score by Jonny Greenwood.  Haunting is a great word to describe this film; stunning yet another, as Day-Lewis delivers a most disagreeable character via an exceptional performance.  See this movie!--D.

I did not realize it at first, but there is no spoken dialouge for the first 15 minutes of the film...I practically jumped when the first words came across, as the 15 minutes of spoken silence where quite effective, giving us an insiders look at the stages of extracting oil in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Daniel Plainview's persistence pays off, as his oil business steadily grows and expands, while raising his young son in the early 20th century.  From the get-go, Daniel is not the nicest or most honest man around, and any gentlemenship he displays is out of business rather than kindness.  For awhile we only know the business side of Daniel, yet desire to know more, which eventually comes around but not until later on in the film.  The desire to understand this man more kept a certain suspense going.  Things are fairly calm throughout the first hour of the film, and you expect (even hope) for something to go wrong to make things interesting.  They do, certain tragedies strike and tensions build, primarily between Daniel and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), the leader of the local church.  The deeper meaning of the story begins to unfold, when we discover the villainous (in his own ways) Plainview and Sunday are more alike than different as would like to believe.Though the film has it's moments and messages that are interesting and make a point, it's the performance of Day-Lewis that is unforgettable and make this film sharp.  He brings all the right elements as a perfected actor should, allowing the role to come alive as if it were the very real thing.Acting - 5Characters - 4Drama - 4Story - 4Overall - 4",4,An effective presentation of the explored subject,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,2195,"['will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'mine', 'thanks', 'creative', 'work', 'writers', 'director', 'perfected', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'was', 'pleasant', 'joy', 'ride', 'entertainment.The', 'film', 'music', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'hear', 'horror', 'film', 'director', 'gazing', 'desert', 'sunny', 'day', 'western', 'U.S', 'music', 'erie', 'perhaps', 'grants', 'immidiate', 'forshadowing', 'what', 'come', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'first', 'spoken', 'dialouge', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'practically', 'jumped', 'when', 'first', 'words', 'came', 'across', '15', 'minutes', 'spoken', 'silence', 'where', 'quite', 'effective', 'giving', 'insiders', 'look', 'stages', 'extracting', 'oil', 'late', '19th', 'early', '20th', 'centuries.Daniel', 'Plainview', 'persistence', 'off', 'oil', 'business', 'steadily', 'expands', 'raising', 'young', 'son', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'get-go', 'Daniel', 'not', 'nicest', 'most', 'honest', 'man', 'gentlemenship', 'business', 'rather', 'kindness', 'awhile', 'only', 'know', 'business', 'side', 'Daniel', 'yet', 'desire', 'know', 'more', 'eventually', 'around', 'not', 'later', 'film', 'desire', 'understand', 'man', 'more', 'kept', 'certain', 'suspense', 'going', 'Things', 'are', 'fairly', 'calm', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'expect', 'even', 'hope', 'something', 'go', 'wrong', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'do', 'certain', 'tragedies', 'strike', 'tensions', 'build', 'primarily', 'Daniel', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'leader', 'local', 'church', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'story', 'unfold', 'when', 'discover', 'villainous', 'own', 'ways', 'Plainview', 'Sunday', 'are', 'more', 'alike', 'different', 'would', 'like', 'believe.Though', 'film', 'moments', 'messages', 'are', 'interesting', 'make', 'point', 'performance', 'Day-Lewis', 'unforgettable', 'make', 'film', 'sharp', 'right', 'elements', 'perfected', 'actor', 'should', 'allowing', 'role', 'come', 'alive', 'were', 'very', 'real', 'thing.Acting', '5Characters', '4Drama', '4Story', '4Overall', '4']",There Will Be Blood

1124305,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00104QSOM,Doug Anderson,"[8, 10]","Best Direction: Paul Thomas Anderson, Best Actor: Daniel Day LewisWhat is really striking about this film is its minimalism. Though based upon a sprawling novel (Upton Sinclair's OIL) Anderson has eliminated all but the bare essentials. Early in the film those bare essentails are tools, rock, a tent and the fierce determination to find something. In the opening scene we watch a man in a narrow chimney-like tunnel that reaches 50 yards below the earth's surface chipping away at a wall of rock. When this man climbs out of this chimney of rock and the camera pans back we see that this man is toiling in a massive and barren landscape. This sparse scene is our introduction to Daniel Plainview whose existence depends upon this ongoing search, and is, in fact, one and the same with this ongoing search. This is a rough-hewn vision of America and American character circa 1900. Its as if the very nation is searching for itself in the forlorn desert-scapes of Texas. Though much later we learn a few sparse details about Plainview's childhood, Anderson's lean style is at one with his lead character; there is no Freudian attempt to explain character with formative experiences; there is no Rosebud moment in this film! Sentiment is completely lacking. We might recall the austere aesthetic of Treasure of the Sierra Madre or think of the grim determinism and detachment of Citizen Kane while watching There Will Be Blood but this film does not make a play for our emotions in the way that Welles' and Huston's films do but rather it makes its appeal with the uncompromising integrity of its no-nonsense realist aesthetic. And this is why the film is so powerful, for the key to Daniel Plainview is not that his family or the nation or the world or God or woman or his fellow man has done something to him. This is not yet another victim film. Rather the power of the film is that Plainview has crafted himself into Daniel Plainview by choice. Plainview has chosen to extricate himself from the world of human emotions. And this stoic stance is, in part, the reason he succeeds for Plainview remains dispassionate in his decisions while other men make decisions based upon emotional needs. Plainview despises emotion but he knows mens interests and how to speak to them, to earn their trust, and to have them sign away their property to him and not some other landgrabber. He is not just a speculator, prospector or oil man but a politican of sorts whose plain speak appeals to the common man even though it veils blatant self-interest. For Plainview life is a contest, an endurance challenge; and though no one will ultimately win this challenge the pleasure, for Plainview, is in seeing other men lose faith, hope, and heart. Daniel Day Lewis does the impossible: he makes the character of Daniel Plainview seem singular and archetypal at the same time. With this character Anderson and Day Lewis bring to life an aspect of American life that has been left largely unexamined in American cinema of late: the selfishness, the emptiness, and the de-humanizing affects/effects of material accumulation. These powerful themes remain in plain view the entire film and yet we are so entranced by them, and by the stark beauty of the landscape, and by Daniel Day Lewis's uncompromising performance that we never feel like we are being lectured at or preached to. If one thinks of Paul Thomas Anderson's previous films (the dripping with camp 70's porn expose that was Boogie Nights and the seedy frenetic dysfunctional collage that was Magnolia) one is wholly unprepared for the crafted quiet of this piece of cinematic realism. The film is as carefully crafted and as grimly deterministic as a Kubrick film and yet this does not, in any way, feel like a Kubrick film. For despite the fact that Anderson's style is at one with his lead character's world view that lead character, believe it or not, has a (humanizing) sense of humor. And it is during two or three of the films most climactic moments that Anderson/Day Lewis show us this usually hidden dimension of Plainview. These brief glimpses of humor are finally what allow for some connection to be made between the lead character and the audience. The humor shows us that the character is aware of the absurdity of his predicament(s) and this self-awareness, ultimately, is what makes Plainview a more complex, a more fascinating, and a more sympathetic character than we may have initially thought. This subtle insertion of humor, in two or three key scenes, is, in the end, what makes Anderson's direction and Day Lewis' performance something beyond great.",5,"Best Adaptation, Direction, Acting By Far",1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,4613,"['Best', 'Direction', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'LewisWhat', 'really', 'striking', 'film', 'minimalism', 'based', 'sprawling', 'novel', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', 'OIL', 'Anderson', 'eliminated', 'bare', 'essentials', 'Early', 'film', 'bare', 'essentails', 'are', 'tools', 'rock', 'tent', 'fierce', 'determination', 'find', 'something', 'opening', 'scene', 'watch', 'man', 'narrow', 'chimney-like', 'tunnel', '50', 'yards', 'earth', 'surface', 'chipping', 'away', 'wall', 'rock', 'When', 'man', 'chimney', 'rock', 'camera', 'back', 'see', 'man', 'toiling', 'massive', 'barren', 'landscape', 'sparse', 'scene', 'introduction', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'existence', 'ongoing', 'search', 'fact', 'one', 'same', 'ongoing', 'search', 'rough-hewn', 'vision', 'America', 'American', 'character', 'circa', '1900', 'very', 'nation', 'searching', 'forlorn', 'desert-scapes', 'Texas', 'Though', 'much', 'later', 'learn', 'few', 'sparse', 'details', 'Plainview', 'childhood', 'Anderson', 'lean', 'style', 'one', 'lead', 'character', 'Freudian', 'attempt', 'explain', 'character', 'formative', 'experiences', 'Rosebud', 'moment', 'film', 'Sentiment', 'completely', 'lacking', 'might', 'recall', 'austere', 'aesthetic', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'think', 'grim', 'determinism', 'detachment', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'watching', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'play', 'emotions', 'way', 'Welles', 'Huston', 'films', 'do', 'rather', 'appeal', 'uncompromising', 'integrity', 'no-nonsense', 'realist', 'aesthetic', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'powerful', 'key', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'not', 'family', 'nation', 'world', 'God', 'woman', 'fellow', 'man', 'done', 'something', 'not', 'yet', 'victim', 'film', 'power', 'film', 'Plainview', 'crafted', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'choice', 'Plainview', 'chosen', 'extricate', 'world', 'human', 'emotions', 'stoic', 'stance', 'part', 'reason', 'Plainview', 'dispassionate', 'decisions', 'other', 'men', 'make', 'decisions', 'based', 'emotional', 'needs', 'Plainview', 'emotion', 'mens', 'interests', 'how', 'speak', 'earn', 'trust', 'have', 'sign', 'away', 'property', 'not', 'other', 'landgrabber', 'not', 'just', 'speculator', 'prospector', 'oil', 'man', 'politican', 'sorts', 'plain', 'speak', 'appeals', 'common', 'man', 'even', 'blatant', 'self-interest', 'Plainview', 'life', 'contest', 'endurance', 'challenge', 'one', 'will', 'ultimately', 'win', 'challenge', 'pleasure', 'Plainview', 'seeing', 'other', 'men', 'lose', 'faith', 'hope', 'heart', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'impossible', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'seem', 'singular', 'archetypal', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'Anderson', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'bring', 'life', 'aspect', 'American', 'life', 'been', 'left', 'largely', 'unexamined', 'American', 'cinema', 'late', 'selfishness', 'emptiness', 'de-humanizing', 'affects/effects', 'material', 'accumulation', 'powerful', 'themes', 'remain', 'plain', 'view', 'entire', 'film', 'yet', 'are', 'so', 'entranced', 'stark', 'beauty', 'landscape', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'uncompromising', 'performance', 'never', 'feel', 'are', 'being', 'lectured', 'preached', 'one', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'films', 'dripping', 'camp', '70', 'porn', 'expose', 'was', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'seedy', 'frenetic', 'dysfunctional', 'collage', 'was', 'Magnolia', 'one', 'wholly', 'unprepared', 'crafted', 'quiet', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'realism', 'film', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'grimly', 'deterministic', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'yet', 'not', 'way', 'feel', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'fact', 'Anderson', 'style', 'one', 'lead', 'character', 'world', 'view', 'lead', 'character', 'believe', 'not', 'humanizing', 'sense', 'humor', 'two', 'three', 'films', 'most', 'climactic', 'moments', 'Anderson/Day', 'Lewis', 'show', 'usually', 'hidden', 'dimension', 'Plainview', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'humor', 'are', 'finally', 'what', 'allow', 'connection', 'be', 'made', 'lead', 'character', 'audience', 'humor', 'character', 'aware', 'absurdity', 'predicament', 's', 'self-awareness', 'ultimately', 'what', 'Plainview', 'more', 'complex', 'more', 'fascinating', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'initially', 'thought', 'subtle', 'insertion', 'humor', 'two', 'three', 'key', 'scenes', 'end', 'what', 'Anderson', 'direction', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'performance', 'something', 'great']",There Will Be Blood

He's greedy, ruthless, cruel, and shamelessly manipulative, to be sure ... but it's really the touch of humanity he occasionally displays that truly makes him tragic, because you can see that beneath all his contempt is a sad, broken-hearted man. Although capable of affection, whenever Daniel feels abandoned or betrayed he reacts viciously and often violently, destroying any possibility of authentic relationships.Throughout the movie his character's fate is tied to that of Eli Sunday, a theatrical minister who, despite superficial differences, is as ruthlessly ambitious as Plainview is. Sunday is Plainview's nemesis and mirror ... their mutual hatred is due to the fact that they surely see all of their own loathsome qualities reflected in the other. Throughout the film the two characters spar, compete, play mind games and torture each other.Although the film ends with a final confrontation between the two characters in which one apparently ""wins"", powerhouse director P.T.

What I found was a great tragedy painted in greys that edge toward darkness through the course of the story, no recourse anywhere to be found. I first took notice of Day Lewis in Gangs of New York and was deeply moved by his performance of Bill the Butcher; his portrayal of the oilman in Blood was a massive advance in both depth and subtlety. For me, the story is run by the characters - and by Day Lewis' character especially, who is nearly constantly onscreen -which is to say that the particulars of the story aren't important; this is a myth, painted in the dark tones of human interaction. Every ounce of 'false' human warmth is stripped away (and the riveting score assuredly helps with that)to give us a portrait of human greed so essential and to the bone that I, at least, was spellbound. I would almost say horrified, but I think ""dread"" is a better word. It's very understandable that many people don't come to movies for this sort of experience, and dislike Blood. Day Lewis shows us an unknowable man - from the start you feel that he may be a terrible man, and as the story unfolds you see that it is true; for me, the oilman's darkness was not far beneath the surface, and the portrayal of this may have intentionally paralleled the movie's ostensible topic - the search for underground oil. Day Lewis' portrayal makes the story that much more painful because we never know why he is the way he is; and we can never truly put a finger on who he is, though we undoubtedly know he is a 'bad man'. Most people like badness nailed down - call it 'evil,' make it obvious, have a clearly 'good' opposition, etc. You'll find none of that here; to me, it's the ambiguity in the face of such utter terribleness that makes this movie profound.

1124314,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B00104QSOM,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[4, 9]","...this is my least favorite Paul Thomas Anderson film (his others which were far, far better: Punch Drunk Love, Magnolia, Boogie Nights).  Technically, it's superb: cinematography, the always-stellar acting of Daniel Day Lewis, score, script, film editing, etc.  However it starts off VERY slow (no dialogue for first ten minutes) and never really picks up because the film is mainly a character study of the workaholic and rapacious oilman Daniel Plainview that DDL plays, yet without any clear antagonists or dramatic tension, other than Eli Sunday, a creepy small-town farmboy-cum-preacher who makes a series of feeble attempts to grab his own piece of the pie, and Plainview's adopted son HW who later becomes estranged from him.Due in large part to the title and to watching Plainview's ruthlessness and greed, I kept thinking this was going to be one of those ""chickens coming home to roost"" karmic tragedies where you see the main character build himself up obsessively and then, through his own inherent flaws, fall apart at the end.  Instead, Plainview merely plateaus into a kind of deeply entrenched and isolated state of evil by the end---still dominant and a bit more twisted and violent than before, but now an eccentric recluse sort of like Howard Hughes.After some thought it was clear to me that Anderson has made what is more or less a ""message movie"" very much in the spirit of Upton Sinclair: a full frontal assault on the two most cherished myths in American history---namely, that of the capitalist entrepreneur ""self-made man,"" and of the church being a moral beacon and pillar of the community.  This film provides a blistering counterpoint: Daniel Plainview the oilman is a heartless, obsessive, one-dimensional workaholic who has neither scruples nor humanity; Eli Sunday the charismatic but hypocritical small-town preacher is equally ambitious, manipulative and ruthless but is at heart impotent and pathetic whenever confronted by Plainview directly, and finally destroyed (literally and figuratively) by Plainview at the end.  In other words, we are presented with a very dark vision of business making religion its whore, as much as religion wants to milk business but is too inept to succeed.  Plainview, as the embodiment of small entrepreneur allowed to grow into large scale industrial tycoon, is simply a psychotic beast who eats Sunday for lunch, right along with all the gullible, weak and passive common people (like Sunday's congregation, whose land he swindles from them) whom Plainview systematically deceives and exploits to make his fortune from though they imagine that they are following Sunday.As Phillip Roth wrote in The Human Stain, ""Human history is a story of the ruthless and the defenseless.""This is a subtle and hard to dispute social-historical analysis, which Anderson's film unfortunately does not do a very good job of communicating clear, in no small part because of how slow and monochromatic it is.",3,"Slow and tedious, though well-intended...",1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,2961,"['least', 'favorite', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'film', 'others', 'were', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'Magnolia', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Technically', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'always-stellar', 'acting', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'score', 'script', 'film', 'editing', 'etc', 'However', 'off', 'VERY', 'slow', 'dialogue', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'film', 'mainly', 'character', 'study', 'workaholic', 'rapacious', 'oilman', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'DDL', 'plays', 'yet', 'clear', 'antagonists', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'other', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'creepy', 'small-town', 'farmboy-cum-preacher', 'who', 'series', 'feeble', 'attempts', 'grab', 'own', 'piece', 'pie', 'Plainview', 'adopted', 'son', 'HW', 'who', 'later', 'estranged', 'him.Due', 'large', 'part', 'title', 'watching', 'Plainview', 'ruthlessness', 'greed', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'chickens', 'coming', 'home', 'roost', 'karmic', 'tragedies', 'where', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'build', 'obsessively', 'then', 'own', 'inherent', 'flaws', 'fall', 'apart', 'end', 'Instead', 'Plainview', 'merely', 'plateaus', 'kind', 'deeply', 'entrenched', 'isolated', 'state', 'evil', 'end', '-still', 'dominant', 'bit', 'more', 'twisted', 'violent', 'before', 'now', 'eccentric', 'recluse', 'sort', 'like', 'Howard', 'Hughes.After', 'thought', 'was', 'clear', 'Anderson', 'made', 'what', 'more', 'less', 'message', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'spirit', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', 'full', 'frontal', 'assault', 'two', 'most', 'cherished', 'myths', 'American', 'history', '-namely', 'capitalist', 'entrepreneur', 'self-made', 'man', 'church', 'being', 'moral', 'beacon', 'pillar', 'community', 'film', 'blistering', 'counterpoint', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'oilman', 'heartless', 'obsessive', 'one-dimensional', 'workaholic', 'who', 'scruples', 'humanity', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'charismatic', 'hypocritical', 'small-town', 'preacher', 'equally', 'ambitious', 'manipulative', 'ruthless', 'heart', 'impotent', 'pathetic', 'whenever', 'confronted', 'Plainview', 'directly', 'finally', 'destroyed', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Plainview', 'end', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'presented', 'very', 'dark', 'vision', 'business', 'making', 'religion', 'whore', 'as', 'much', 'religion', 'milk', 'business', 'too', 'inept', 'succeed', 'Plainview', 'embodiment', 'small', 'entrepreneur', 'allowed', 'grow', 'large', 'scale', 'industrial', 'tycoon', 'simply', 'psychotic', 'beast', 'who', 'Sunday', 'lunch', 'right', 'gullible', 'weak', 'passive', 'common', 'people', 'Sunday', 'congregation', 'land', 'whom', 'Plainview', 'systematically', 'make', 'fortune', 'imagine', 'are', 'following', 'Sunday.As', 'Phillip', 'Roth', 'wrote', 'Human', 'Stain', 'Human', 'history', 'story', 'ruthless', 'defenseless', 'subtle', 'hard', 'dispute', 'social-historical', 'analysis', 'Anderson', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'communicating', 'clear', 'small', 'part', 'how', 'slow', 'monochromatic']",There Will Be Blood

NCFOM is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, while TWBB is based on the book ""Oil!"" by Upton Sinclair. NCFOM is set in 1980, TWBB is set in the early 20th century. One's about violence, the other's about greed. And so on. But I do admit, I slightly prefer NCFOM over TWBB, mostly because of the silent suspense and the absolutely creepy performance of Javier Bardem. But TWBB is still a great film as well.As I've said before, this film is mostly about greed and how it affects us and the people around us. Daniel Plainview (played by the excellent Daniel Day-Lewis) is a wealthy businessman who relies on oil for his profits. Accompanied by his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), both individuals are led to a barren California city called Little Boston. There, they discover oil that's been leaked out of the ground due to a recent earthquake. With careful planning, Daniel attempts to buy the entire city, with just a few issues at hand. A young man by the name of Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) wants $10,000 to build his church, The Church of the Third Revelation. From this point on, it's a battle between religion, hypocrisy, wealth, and family.Like NCFOM, TWBB tends to be very slow-moving. I see this in a good way. This film doesn't move too quick because we get to see the characters being clearly and fully affected by the oil that's sleeping underground. They are fully realized, as the slow pacing helps us understand these people. Speeding it up in a Hollywoodized way won't help since this is indeed a character-driven story. With the slower and steadier way, there is no confusion on what's going on, and the partial ambiance that surrounds the movie adds to the tension between Daniel and Eli. Speaking of Daniel and Eli, I just have to say that the actors have done a splendid job. Before this, I've seen only one film that stars Day-Lewis: Last of the Mohicans. He was absolutely amazing in that film, and he is even more amazing here. You never know when he's going to lose his temper, or what he's really going to do in the next scene, which makes the character even scarier. Meanwhile, according to imdb, Dano had only four days to prepare for the role of Eli, since another actor had to be replaced for reasons unknown. Thankfully, he was able to pull it off. The quiet determination of the character is fully realized, and you can never tell if he's a hypocrite or just someone who thinks he's seen God. As for the supporting cast, they play their parts very well. The one exception here is Kevin J. O'Connor: he's seems very wooden at times. But other than that, Dillon Freasier and the other supporting actors can be very believable throughout the entire film.Almost everything else in TWBB(cinematography, set designs, etc.) are flawless. And I say almost, because I had just one tiny problem. A few music cues that are chosen here don't seem to fit the scenes that they play in. But the music can be very appropriate at times, like Johhny Greenwood's percussive ""Convergence"" when both tragedy and success strike in the middle of the film. The piece itself adds greater suspense and drama in this very important part of the film. TWBB overall is one of the more marvelous films of 2007. Day-Lewis deserved the oscar, as well as Robert Elswit for the stellar cinematography.Grade: A-",5,"""I have a competition in me . . .

1124319,A10JDPEQ8GJ2K1,B00104QSOM,Erik Bateson,"[7, 9]","When I first saw ""There Will Be Blood,"" I was disappointed. While I enjoyed the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and I appreciated the gorgeous cinematography, the film did not do much for me. For one thing, it felt pretentious and overlong, the work of a talented, but self-indulgent director.What a difference a second viewing makes. One of my favorite film critics, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune, picked the film as his favorite of the last decade, so I decided to revisit it. After that re-viewing, I watched it a third time. This is the rare film that grows on repeated viewings.The second time around, I did not find the pacing of the film to be slow, but patient. The film, to me, really penetrates to the heart of the American tradition of rugged individualism and the good and bad of capitalism (put roughly, the first half of the film shows the good of capitalism and the second half shows the bad). Daniel Day-Lewis is just mesmerizing as Daniel Plainview, a character so mysterious, he makes Kevin Spacey in ""The Usual Suspects"" look like Mary Poppins. The lack of any backstory or context provided for him and his son, H.W., will no doubt frustrate some filmgoers, and this film is certainly not for everyone, but for me, it's really excellent stuff.Every time I come back to this film, I find something new in it; the more I see it, the stranger and sadder and more ambiguous the film seems to me. Many critics have taken issue with the last forty five minutes or so of the film, which takes place much later than the earlier part of the film, but for me, that is what really makes the film great. I would compare the ending of the film to the ending of ""Apocalypse Now""; frustratingly eccentric for some filmgoers, but for me, absolutely great.If you haven't seen this, see it, and if you have, see it again.

He travels the country identifying opportunities where to buy land that yields black gold, oil, to gain power, wealth and status.It is during the early part of the 20th century and we get the impression that the process was brutal, without regard to the cost of human life and at times with dire consequences for the families that lived on the land where oil was found.The movie confronts religion and family values against capitalism and the acquisition of power, and it is terrible to see how a young man who claims to be a prophet forces Daniel Plainview to accept religion in exchange for land where to build a pipe line, later paying back by having to renounce his beliefs in exchange for money to cover debts resulting from the market crash that leaves him penniless.Not a movie I will see again... anytime soon.",2,Not a movie I will ever see again...,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,1467,"['acquired', 'movie', 'had', 'won', 'several', 'awards', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'one', 'favorite', 'stars', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'found', 'disappointed', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'story', 'clear', 'indication', 'where', 'ambition', 'corruption', 'big', 'business', 'specially', 'oil', 'industry', 'can', 'take', 'individual', 'passions', 'lack', 'humanity', 'individuals', 'simply', 'abhorrent.The', 'film', 'delves', 'beginnings', 'oil', 'industry', 'United', 'States', 'seen', 'life', 'self', 'made', 'oilman', 'name', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'country', 'identifying', 'opportunities', 'where', 'buy', 'land', 'black', 'gold', 'oil', 'gain', 'power', 'wealth', 'status.It', 'early', 'part', '20th', 'century', 'get', 'impression', 'process', 'was', 'brutal', 'regard', 'cost', 'human', 'life', 'times', 'dire', 'consequences', 'families', 'lived', 'land', 'where', 'oil', 'was', 'found.The', 'movie', 'confronts', 'religion', 'family', 'values', 'capitalism', 'acquisition', 'power', 'terrible', 'see', 'how', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'prophet', 'forces', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'accept', 'religion', 'exchange', 'land', 'where', 'build', 'pipe', 'line', 'later', 'paying', 'back', 'having', 'renounce', 'beliefs', 'exchange', 'money', 'cover', 'debts', 'resulting', 'market', 'crash', 'penniless.Not', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon']",There Will Be Blood

The beginning of the movie shows a man all alone beaten and battered by his hard work for the Geological Survey, and getting hardly anything in return for it.  After a lot of hard work and perseverance he becomes a successful Oilman prospecting for crude oil, the blood of the Earth, and living the good life of luxury .... but that isn't enough for him.  And if money galore isn't enough for a man then how must he relate with those around him?A main theme through the movie is how the Oilman and the Pastor in the story get along.  The music during these scenes seems to suggest what I had suspected: Battle of the Shamans.  There's an odd twist to the interrelationship between these two characters.  The Christian Pastor seems like a decent human being who perhaps really is a man of genuine faith, but there's no doubt that, at the same time, he is also a trickster who capitalizes on the gullibility of his churchmembers and his miracles are of course, well, less than miraculous.  Not so with the Oilman, his miracles are quite real and the proof is concretely validated everywhere.  Problem is the Oilman is a divided man as well; there's the sense in the movie that he has a heart and does what he can to prevent injustices and abuse, but at the same time he's extremely anti-social and when his temper flares it flares much, like a Psycho or Friday the 13th movie.  The Oilman is tired of the dishonest people around him, he can't stand the way people constantly lie to get ahead instead of actually doing the gritty hard work, and the next time he meets another liar like that he just might snap ... and does, and then there is blood.This leaves me fascinated with the story as I love & hate both men at the same time, and can't help but to relate with the both of them as well.  Plus, it is worthy of noting that there is, in my opinion, much more real politics shown in this flick than there is any movie about presidents, congressmen, and senators.  I found it fascinating that Standard Oil's name was dropped in the movie, a slight hint to the Rockefeller's for those who are familiar with that corrupt story.  Geopolitics is a central theme in the movie and it's shown fairly well: Finders keepers & Possession is 9/10ths of the law.  In addition to all this the movie has some very interesting classical music playing throughout, some Arvo Part (nice choice), a Violin Concerto by Brahms (another great pick), etc.  All in all though, not everyone is going to be able to understand, relate with, and like this movie, but I definetely did.  5 Stars.",5,The Plain View,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,2676,"['Something', 'movie', 'time', 'found', 'amazing', 'amount', 'analytical', 'philosophy', 'beginning', 'movie', 'man', 'alone', 'beaten', 'battered', 'hard', 'work', 'Geological', 'Survey', 'getting', 'hardly', 'anything', 'return', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'perseverance', 'successful', 'Oilman', 'prospecting', 'crude', 'oil', 'blood', 'Earth', 'living', 'good', 'life', 'luxury', ""n't"", 'enough', 'money', 'galore', ""n't"", 'enough', 'man', 'then', 'how', 'must', 'relate', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'how', 'Oilman', 'Pastor', 'story', 'get', 'music', 'scenes', 'suggest', 'what', 'had', 'suspected', 'Battle', 'Shamans', 'odd', 'twist', 'interrelationship', 'two', 'characters', 'Christian', 'Pastor', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'perhaps', 'really', 'man', 'genuine', 'faith', 'doubt', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'trickster', 'who', 'gullibility', 'churchmembers', 'miracles', 'are', 'course', 'well', 'less', 'miraculous', 'Not', 'so', 'Oilman', 'miracles', 'are', 'quite', 'real', 'proof', 'concretely', 'validated', 'everywhere', 'Problem', 'Oilman', 'divided', 'man', 'well', 'sense', 'movie', 'heart', 'what', 'can', 'prevent', 'injustices', 'abuse', 'same', 'time', 'extremely', 'anti-social', 'when', 'temper', 'much', 'Psycho', 'Friday', '13th', 'movie', 'Oilman', 'tired', 'dishonest', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'way', 'people', 'constantly', 'lie', 'get', 'ahead', 'instead', 'actually', 'doing', 'gritty', 'hard', 'work', 'next', 'time', 'liar', 'just', 'might', 'snap', 'then', 'blood.This', 'leaves', 'fascinated', 'story', 'love', 'hate', 'men', 'same', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'relate', 'as', 'well', 'worthy', 'noting', 'opinion', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'politics', 'shown', 'flick', 'movie', 'presidents', 'congressmen', 'senators', 'found', 'fascinating', 'Standard', 'Oil', 'name', 'was', 'dropped', 'movie', 'slight', 'hint', 'Rockefeller', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'corrupt', 'story', 'Geopolitics', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'shown', 'fairly', 'well', 'Finders', 'keepers', 'Possession', '9/10ths', 'law', 'addition', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'classical', 'music', 'playing', 'Arvo', 'Part', 'nice', 'choice', 'Violin', 'Concerto', 'Brahms', 'great', 'pick', 'etc', 'not', 'everyone', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'relate', 'movie', 'definetely', 'did', '5', 'Stars']",There Will Be Blood

1124328,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B00104QSOM,Genevieve Hayes,"[9, 14]","""There Will Be Blood"" tells the story of an early 20th Century oil tycoon, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his interactions with those around him, in particular, his son and a young preacher, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano).""There Will Be Blood"" has received much critical acclaim and is currently ranked at #107 in the IMdB Top 250, and yet, I just can't see why. Paul Thomas Anderson is a very good writer and director, as has been demonstrated by his earlier works ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"", but the sprawling character structure format Anderson used in his previous works, just doesn't work in this case. Instead, I just found ""There Will Be Blood"" to be overly long, depressing and unfocussed.One of the biggest problems with ""There Will Be Blood"" is that there just aren't enough major characters to sustain 2  hours of film. Whereas ""Magnolia"" must have had around a dozen major characters in it, ""There Will Be Blood"" only really has one, Daniel Plainview, and he isn't all that interesting. Daniel Plainview's character doesn't seem to change or develop at all for the duration of the movie. I think that one of the main purposes of this film is to show the interaction between Plainview and Eli Sunday (the interaction between capitalism and religion), but there aren't all that many scenes in which these characters interact and they are too spaced out to really have much of an impact (and in my opinion, don't adequately justify the ending of the film). I think that this film could have been greatly improved by trimming it down to around 100 minutes, so as to intensify the focus on these scenes.As with all of Anderson's movies, ""There Will Be Blood"" is beautifully filmed, but in a way, that makes it all the more frustrating. It's like a big, beautifully wrapped Christmas box that only contains a pair of socks. It definitely does not deserve all of the awards and nominations that it received. In my opinion, ""Breach"", which was released in the same year as ""There Will Be Blood"" and received virtually no nominations, is a much better written and acted movie (Chris Cooper was brilliant in ""Breach"", while Daniel Day-Lewis seemed to be almost overacting in this film) and whereas I doubt I will ever watch ""There Will Be Blood"" again, I suspect that my copy of ""Breach"" will be viewed many more times.",2,This was nominated for best picture?

My family was involved in the oil industry in one way or another from 1959 to 1987. One of the first places the film names is Signal Hill in Long Beach CA where my mother was a dispatcher for many years, and my father was a scientist that developed the project to inject steam into the tar in Yorba Linda Ca, that was later adopted to Kern County and other places that provide a majority of domestic crude oil. I myself worked for many years on oil rigs in Kern County (Oildale, Belridge, Taft etc. until my last day when I nearly lost my hand in '87) So.... I thought a film about the early days of California's oil industry would be fascinating.But here is the deal,Every character in the film is  so narcissistic and amoral that the great acting and stunning cinematography was just wasted. I didn't care about any of the characters in the story (with the exception of the wife of the son) enough to enjoy the film at all.So if you want a movie that is well acted, and well filmed, but is unmoving and dull with an annoying soundtrack, this is for you.

On journeying there he finds a small rural community living on the edge of existence in a mid west that while is still wild carries much of the innocence and generosity that for us in the West unfortunately has become something of a bygone era.The first suggestion that there may be a conflict of interests comes when Day-Lewis buys up land in the area but one member of the community refuses to sell until he speaks with him personally, something Day-Lewis declines and later lives to regret.  A local religious leader requests that he bless the well when it opens, Day-Lewis a business minded man only declines and so begins a spiraling conflict between business and religion that sets the theme of the film.The town grows and so too does Eli, the young religious leaders congregation.  His fiery sermons grip the community and when an accident occurs at the well causing injury to Day-Lewis's son Eli is not slow in blaming this on the lack of the well being 'blessed' before use.  There is also a conflict between Day-Lewis and the established oil companies that wish to buy out all smaller rivals Day-Lewis included.Day-Lewis ever the lonely man throughout the film meets what he thinks is his long lost brother, someone who feels could share in his success.  The conflict between business and religion grows reaching a climax when Day-Lewis is forced into conversion in order to close a business deal.Day-Lewis does a first rate job in this film.  His acting is superb, his tone and personality carry the viewer back to a bygone era in American history.  The director has clearly gone to some work in capturing a small community that once 'did not even have bread' slowly turn into a thriving 'oil town'  The tone of the film is dark (Even in the brightest light of the desert) and really does capture the sparse surroundings of the mid west.The dramatic conclusion at the end of the film I felt was something of an anti climax.  I actually hoped for something better but I found the dialogue between Eli and Day-Lewis first rate.  Two men who had formed a grudging alliance over the years while remaining bitterest enemies deep inside.While Eli is ever the sly sneaky individual, keen to exploit religion and keep an iron grip on his small community.  Day-Lewis the shrewd business man whose only real love is for his adopted son will stop at nothing to achieve his business aims and hold on to what he has at whatever costs.My only complaint about this film would be the musical score.

The film is a long song (158 minutes), covering a fascinating span of time in turn of the century California when oil gained the lure of gold and transformed the land and the people into creatures of capitalism and greed and lust, and were it not for the presence of Daniel Day-Lewis' powerful performance as the man who makes it all happen, the story itself would become tiresome.  It doesn't.Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a silver miner in 1898, but soon discovers oil and begins on a mission to become wealthy, owning most of the oil fields from the mountains of central California to the Pacific Ocean. With his medicine man manner of getting people to do what he wants he pursues his greed relentlessly, disrupting small sleepy towns like Little Boston as he gains access to the wealth of the black gold.  There are odd characters along the way, such as the evangelist Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) who become crushable clods beneath Plainview's boots. The progress of the story is well known to most: it is the telling of the tale in the hands of wholly credible, completely physically immersed Daniel Day-Lewis that makes the story seem new.The film's grimy atmosphere is well presented in Robert Elswit's cinematography and the odd musical score by Jonny Greenwood is as ominous as the vantage of Plainview. Greenwood elects to weave classical works into the fabric of the film: when young HW falls deaf after an explosion the silence is partnered by one of Arv&ouml; P&auml;rt's 'Fratres', and the film's credits are displayed over the Anne-Sophie Mutter/von Karajan recording of Brahms' Violin Concerto. Strange bedfellows, yes, but entirely appropriate to the overall mood of the film. The journey is long and depressing, but the power of Day-Lewis' performance is magic.

Only two things wrong with this movie, 1)some one made it, 2) I watched it.If you took away the dialogue, music, acting, scenery, cinematography and costumes, you would have ""Ishtar"" and that would still be an improvement over this movie.  For the first ten minutes there is no dialogue but some of the worst background music you've ever heard that had nothing to do with what was happening.  There are so many pregnant pauses in this movie I was afraid it would give birth to something worse.  Grumbling and growling do not make a movie.Half the time we have no idea who the people are who pass through this movie, they're there and then they're gone.  The writer/director based the movie on an obscure 'Upton Sinclair' novel; he should have left it buried in the library.  A good deal of the movie is spent watching people staring, not doing anything but staring or just walking.  You can cut the tension with a feather, please.Should I ever meet Paul Thomas Anderson (sounds like a serial killer), I would be tempted to tie him to a chair, tape open his eyes and make him watch 'Andy Warhol's Empire State Building' which is 24 hours of watching the ESB and that's still better than this movie and makes more sense.This is the kind of movie that gives 'Art Movies' a bad name, or any moving picture for that matter.

1124335,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B00104QSOM,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[5, 11]","To me, this is a typical PT Anderson film.  It has great sequences in it. It also has incredibly bad ones.  It's overlong (and I love long films).It has great performances, and it has bad ones.  Its dialogue is awful.  It has great cinemtography and production design, but thematically it's a mess.  In other words, There Will Be Blood is an incredibly uneven film, which is consistent with all of PT Anderson's work.PT Anderson is an anomaly in his age bracket.  He's a Gen X director, but has no real sense of Gen X ""irony"" or smugness.  He has ambition coming out of every pore of his body.  You have to admire the hell out of him for that.  He wants to make the great, grand picture.  Most of his peers make very shallow films (Tarantino's Grindhouse is a good example).  I can't imagine PT Anderson watching Switchblade Sisters and saying ""this is a great film"".  I can see him saying ""that chick is hot, but I still shouldn't be watching this garbage"".  Having said that, he just can't make a really consistent film.  This was his first film in nearly 6 years (the last one was Punch Drunk Love in 2001), and overall, There Will Be Blood is a mess.There is a lot of good here.  The cinematography is gorgeous.  It's one of the most beautifully shot films I've seen in a while.  The production design is fantastic (by Jack Fisk, one of the best in the business).  The acting by Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing.  Lewis's face, eyes, and voice are so expressive that you forget some of the bad dialogue that you can't take your eyes off of him.  There are some downright surreal, intense scenes.  When Daniel Day Lewis kills his ""brother"", it's one of the most effective scenes in the film.  Music, look, acting, it all gels.  The next scene (in a church) is purposely overlit, and continues the surrealism.  It's very good.  The rest of the film continues the haunted look, which I really liked.Unfortunately, these good things are undone by many bad things.  The dialogue here has to be some of the worst I've heard in a long time.  Andreson has never been able to write really good dialogue, and here it's really bad.  Lewis's monologues are really obvious, and the infamous line ""I drink your milkshake"" has entered into movie folklore, but not for the majesticness of the speech, but for the camp value.  There's also a really, really bad line in one of Paul Dano's (Eli Sunday is the name of the character.  Rather obvious for a preacher, eh?) where he says ""I will gum you!"".  The townspeople are portrayed as simpletons, something that seems to always happen in period pieces like this.  There is no real motivation for Lewis's character other than he is greedy.  Thematically, his desertion of his son (he does it twice in the film) makes no sense.  One scene he is playing with the boy, then the boy goes deaf, then Lewis puts him on a train.  Then he comes back.  Then later in the film, Lewis tells his son he's an orphan who Lewis just used as a prop to get people to go along with his plans.  This is obviously not true, but there is no explanation, narratively or artistically, as to why there's such inconsistency.  PT Anderson seems to be stuck between a straightforward narrative and a surreal tone, and it doesn't work.  And the final scene, while beautifully shot and designed, is unintentionally funny, much like the frogs finale in Magnolia.Dano's character is poorly drawn.  Many have said he was miscast, but I would argue that he just didn't have a good character to build on.  He's the cliched preacher.  The rest of the character are caricatures.  The music score is another problem.  Sometimes it's perfect (like in the brother's death scene), other times it's so out of place.  Anderson was trying to do someting different obviously, but it just doesn't work overall.  The score is reminiscent of Stravinsky and Mozart, and sounds more like a symphony than a film score.  Many have said that Johnny Greenwood's score would make a good listening experience in itself, away from the film.  They're right.Many have said that PT Anderson borrows (or steals) from Kubrick here.  He does.  The leaps in time recall the abrupt time changes in 2001 and Full Metal Jacket, the madness of Lewis recalls The Shining (he's even walking the same way Jack Nicholson does at the end of The Shining), and the eerie, deliberately uttered dialogue in the final scene is reminiscent of the billard room scene in Eyes Wide Shut.  Anderson also said in interviews he wanted to emulate the Dawn of Man sequence in 2001 in the opening of the film (which has minimal dialogue).  Regardless of whether Anderson is ripping off Kubrick or simply being influenced by him (there is a difference between the two), the whole film still doesn't flow, like 2001, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut do.So, overall, this film has enough great moments in it to view it.  It is not as good as Citizen Kane or Giant.  Those films had a lot of depth and character that this one simply lacks.  See There Will Be Blood (great title, by the way) for Daniel Day Lewis, the cinematography, production design, and, if you're into that sort of thing, laugh at the unintentionally funny scenes.",3,"I will gum you!!!

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[0, 1]","Director Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia"") achieves something very rare in films, he manages to create a really extraordinary film whose main character Daniel Plainview played by Daniel Day-Lewis (""My Left Foot"") is for the most part reprehensible. With the exception of rare moments of affection for his deaf son, whose deafness is caused by an accident at his father's oil wells, Plainview cares for no one on earth, hates most people, is highly competitive and filled with unstoppable greed and ambition.The film is based on a novel by Upton Sinclair OIL and is set in the early decades of the 20th century when a lot of Americans acted like Plainview-- to a lesser degree we hope-- in their quest for wealth at whatever expense.The critics could not get enough of this film. Daniel Day-Lewis earned an Oscar for best actor for his portrayal of Plainview. While he is supported by good performances by other actors, notably that of Paul Dano (""Little Miss Sunshine"") as the hell-fire minister of the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli Sunday, the film ultimately belongs to Day-Lewis.In addition to his statement about greed, Anderson also shoots a nice arrow into fundamentalist, crazy religion.

1124346,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B00104QSOM,I'm Right,"[1, 1]","To celebrate my 100th passive-aggresive review shot out like projectile diarrhea out on Amazon's pages to the horror of many, I've chosen a personal favorite of mine: There Will Be Blood, where the only criticism I can find about it is the name. There Will Be Blood chronicles the life of Daniel Plainview, an ambitious miner-turned-oilman in search of fortune during the early 1900's when the industrial revolution was hitting the western United States.The themes present throughout the film range from family to isolation, greed to power, and creation of a town to destruction of one's mind. The whole time slowly showing Daniel's fall from grace and descent into alcohol-fueled madness in his self-percieved 'victory', whilst he's isolated himself from everyone that loved him into his hollow mansion.Early on in the movie one of Daniel's men dies due to a rigging accident, leaving his infant son behind to the care of Daniel Plainview. When Daniel's going from town to town offering his services he uses his 'son' H.W. to show everyone that he is a family man and not a faceless Union Oil lobbyist. As his business expands Daniel shows H.W. the tools of the trade, some tips and pointers, and is raising H.W. to be his successor. However due to another oil accident (before the insurance days) H.W. is caught in the loud pressure release of the excavation and becomes permanently deaf, unable to communicate to Daniel anymore. So what does Daniel, the warm-hearted and loving family man do? Send his son off to a San Francisco boarding school for the deaf of course! After his 'healing' from Eli however Daniel takes his son back and brings him a teacher, in order to assist with communicating.Near the end when Daniel is in his lofty mansion his son approaches him to tell him that he's breaking off with his father and starting his own drilling company in Mexico. Daniel takes this as a business threat and disowns H.W. right there on the spot, calling him nothing more than a cute face used for buying land. H.W. walks away and Daniel is left alone in his dark mansion, a few fleeting memories of H.W. passing through his mind, showing the audience that Daniel really did love his adopted son at some point. So what drove them apart, was it H.W. going deaf? Was it Daniel gaining all of his riches? Or did they just slowly have a falling out as H.W. matured more and grew to know his father in another light?Another plot point in the movie is where Daniel meets his long lost supposed brother Henry who heard about Daniel striking big and wants to offer his assistance. It is with  Henry who Daniel feels the most comfortable with revealing his deepest and darkest thoughts, how he hates most people, and wants to make a fortune to get away from everybody. The fact that Daniel trusts his supposed brother so much shows that somewhere deep down he has a sense and admiration for family bonds and trust, but somewhere for some reason he's been alienated from his own family and has a fractured family of his own. It kind of makes me laugh when I think of the scenes with Daniel, Henry, and H.W. together, a supposed 'family' when in actuallity none of them are even remotely related. Daniel eventually gains suspicions about Henry and puts him to the test to see if he's really the brother, the supposed brother who Daniel has shared his darkest secrets with has infiltrated his trust and guard. After putting Henry down Daniel is shaken to the core, knowing that his real brother is dead this is the only moment where you really see Daniel in a vulnerable state, his real family is dead and gone, and his only family is a phony act that Daniel orchestrated.Another major conflict in There Will Be Blood is the slow burning rivalry between Daniel and Eli Sunday, the towns local priest who rival's Daniel in his taste for money and power. Daniel and Eli both represent two opposing foundations of the United States; capitalism and religion. Daniel promises the gullible townsfolk that he'll be making everyone prospourous and rich, while Eli promises everyone that they'll be healed and receive salvation, both headstrong in their mission enough to warrant butting heads on more than one occasion, all the awhile keeping it under the noses of the townspeople.Eventually Daniel reaches an ultimatum from one of his prospective clients, that they'll allow him to run an oil line through their land only if he attends one of Eli's sermons and 'accepts salvation', in a great scene of Eli getting revenge on Daniel while giving the church audience a show. Daniel, in spite of bringing profit and wealth among the community, is finally confronted in front of an audience about all of his failings as a father and as a family man, triggered by his abandonment of H.W. and Henry's murder. Eli is much more enthusiastic about confronting Daniel's demons than Daniel, after Daniel threatened a union oilman's life for bringing up his family, he is left powerless due to the overwhelming number of church-goers following Eli's demands for salvation. Eli has won this round.Onto the final scene Daniel Plainview is woken from a liquor-fuel slumber by none other than Eli, who's apparently forgotten about the hard feelings from over a decade ago, but Daniel in his isolated alcoholic madness sure as hell hasn't, and Eli has walked right into the spider's web. Sobbing and begging for money, Eli reveals that he has gone broke and is desperate for another donation, while Daniel silently soaks up Eli's misery and despair until he erupts in a rage and bludgeons Eli to death. Daniel 'won' in a game where there are seemingly no winners.There are other aspects of There Will Be Blood to admire, the score itself by Johnny Greenwood punctuates the mood, creating memorable scenes, while the cinematography shows the yawning rural landscape, with all the open fields analogous with the vast potential for oil striking the United States was in at the time. There is no scene more breath-taking that I've ever seen then when H.W. is being carried away by Daniel while the oil is coming from the ground, the music, the acting, the scenery, it all molded together to what I would call the best scene of all time. When Daniel and Henry are setting the trail for the pipeline to run through the music is industrious and ambitious, and when the fifteen year time gap is shown through the melancholy violins sets the stage perfectly for the final act.Really I could go on and on about There Will Be Blood, this is an American classic that rewards repeat viewings, each viewing showing a subtlety in each character's behaviors, while still cloaking their true intentions and thoughts in mystery and speculation. This is not a movie for everybody, the story unfolds at a slow pace letting you get more involved in the world and despite the dumb horror movie title there is almost no blood, the violence isn't the focus of the movie, it's usually accidential and whenever there is bloodshed it's by the hands of our 'hero' Daniel Plainview. However those going in who have patience and searching for something unique will find a wholly unique and engrossing experience, going into one man's heart of darkness in the boom of the oil

1124349,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00104QSOM,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 4]","The film has well earned its prizes, awards and other distinctions. But beyond these labels on the sleeve of the DVD or the poster of the film, the film will remain a milestone in the cinema that tries to show the real world and the ruthlessness of its survival instinct.The first element I will point out is that it gives the lie to Hubbard and his survival in scientology. In the real world there is no survival without development and development is first: no development then extinction. Ask Neanderthals when he was to share Europe with Cro-Magnon. The poor Neanderthals could not even fish and ran like mammoths. The real survival is in the power of man, as a species and as an individual, to develop. Survival that does not bring and presuppose development is just a fake, a false prophecy. I say that for two reasons.The first reason is that without the oil industry, there would have been no car industry (and other inner combustion engine industry), no gas station networks, no highway networks, no suburban development. That's the most clear and brutal side of the film. The oil industry brings a new phase in the industrial revolution of its own on which we are still living and polluting. Millions of people got jobs, millions of people got income, millions of people got a present and a future. Survival in development. But this development is also violent and it is the fitter who can develop most and fastest. So on the starting line there might be many people but on the arrival line there will only be a few if not only one. It is easier to make a camel get through the eye of a needle than to bring many winners on the winning line of industrial competition.The film is absolutely ugly and gruesome about it and it makes so many people, in the film, completely sick and disturbed. A man is ready to assume the identity of another provided this new identity is that of the main character's brother for an obvious profit. Don't forget that prophet and profit are homonyms. A child is ready to set the hut in which he is sleeping with his father and fake uncle ablaze just to mark his territory and his resistance and his dissatisfaction. And there are so many other cases.Then, my second reason, in any fast developing situation like this one there are some people who will take advantage of it to mentally control the change, that is to say to gather people behind them and then pressurize the industrialists so that the gurus can get what they want, which is worldly power and money. These are the second type of false prophets of the industrial age. They can be religious and affiliated to any church, most of them being purely opportunistic about the rich provided they give money to the various churches, temples, synagogues or mosques, and of course other good benefacting (I mean bringing a profit to the prophet) organizations. The religious organizations and their prophets, false most of them, are the typical form of that vampiristic money sucking leeches in the USA who can only survive if God blesses the child and America.But there are other forms that are just as deadly and life-sucking. You can see Hitler and the Nazi party, and all other fascistic movements, as exactly the same ambition: take advantage of the developing industrial revolution to line your pockets with power and money. But on the other side you can have all the socialistic and communistic preaching that is exactly the same thing. And the military forces can decide to use their weapons to become the false prophets of this industrial development. The worst concoction is when one of these political movements takes the control of the armed forces, or vice versa, and then they establish a totally irreversible dictatorship.Irreversible, well, maybe not.The film suggests that you can always become deaf to these and run away and start your own development in some other country or state. It also suggests that the industrialists and the prophesizing profiteers may get into a fight to the death and then some others will come and pick up the pieces and recuperate the whole treasure chest. The film does not allude to the political mode of democratic management of this development. Just be the prophet that will win an election till a new prophet comes and wins it against you and gets you out. But be sure this intruder will not last long and will be out of the job when another one comes and claim victory. Democracy is a permanent rotation of false prophets.AlleluiaJacques COULARDEAU",5,"So oily, so slick, so humanly gross",1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,4494,"['film', 'well', 'earned', 'prizes', 'awards', 'other', 'distinctions', 'labels', 'sleeve', 'DVD', 'poster', 'film', 'film', 'will', 'remain', 'milestone', 'cinema', 'show', 'real', 'world', 'ruthlessness', 'survival', 'instinct.The', 'first', 'element', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'lie', 'Hubbard', 'survival', 'scientology', 'real', 'world', 'survival', 'development', 'development', 'first', 'development', 'then', 'extinction', 'Ask', 'Neanderthals', 'when', 'was', 'share', 'Europe', 'Cro-Magnon', 'poor', 'Neanderthals', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'fish', 'ran', 'mammoths', 'real', 'survival', 'power', 'man', 'species', 'individual', 'develop', 'Survival', 'not', 'bring', 'presuppose', 'development', 'just', 'fake', 'false', 'prophecy', 'say', 'two', 'reasons.The', 'first', 'reason', 'oil', 'industry', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'car', 'industry', 'other', 'inner', 'combustion', 'engine', 'industry', 'gas', 'station', 'networks', 'highway', 'networks', 'suburban', 'development', 'most', 'clear', 'brutal', 'side', 'film', 'oil', 'industry', 'new', 'phase', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'own', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'polluting', 'Millions', 'people', 'got', 'jobs', 'millions', 'people', 'got', 'income', 'millions', 'people', 'got', 'present', 'future', 'Survival', 'development', 'development', 'also', 'violent', 'fitter', 'who', 'can', 'develop', 'most', 'fastest', 'So', 'starting', 'line', 'might', 'be', 'many', 'people', 'arrival', 'line', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'few', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'easier', 'make', 'camel', 'get', 'eye', 'needle', 'bring', 'many', 'winners', 'winning', 'line', 'industrial', 'competition.The', 'film', 'absolutely', 'ugly', 'gruesome', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'film', 'completely', 'sick', 'disturbed', 'man', 'ready', 'assume', 'identity', 'provided', 'new', 'identity', 'main', 'character', 'brother', 'obvious', 'profit', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'prophet', 'profit', 'are', 'homonyms', 'child', 'ready', 'set', 'hut', 'sleeping', 'father', 'fake', 'uncle', 'ablaze', 'just', 'mark', 'territory', 'resistance', 'dissatisfaction', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'cases.Then', 'second', 'reason', 'fast', 'developing', 'situation', 'one', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'advantage', 'mentally', 'control', 'change', 'say', 'gather', 'people', 'then', 'pressurize', 'industrialists', 'so', 'gurus', 'can', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'worldly', 'power', 'money', 'are', 'second', 'type', 'false', 'prophets', 'industrial', 'age', 'can', 'be', 'religious', 'affiliated', 'church', 'most', 'being', 'purely', 'opportunistic', 'rich', 'provided', 'give', 'money', 'various', 'churches', 'temples', 'synagogues', 'mosques', 'course', 'other', 'good', 'benefacting', 'mean', 'bringing', 'profit', 'prophet', 'organizations', 'religious', 'organizations', 'prophets', 'false', 'most', 'are', 'typical', 'form', 'vampiristic', 'money', 'sucking', 'leeches', 'USA', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'survive', 'God', 'child', 'America.But', 'are', 'other', 'forms', 'are', 'just', 'deadly', 'life-sucking', 'can', 'see', 'Hitler', 'Nazi', 'party', 'other', 'fascistic', 'movements', 'exactly', 'same', 'ambition', 'take', 'advantage', 'developing', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'line', 'pockets', 'power', 'money', 'other', 'side', 'can', 'have', 'socialistic', 'communistic', 'preaching', 'exactly', 'same', 'thing', 'military', 'forces', 'can', 'decide', 'use', 'weapons', 'become', 'false', 'prophets', 'industrial', 'development', 'worst', 'concoction', 'when', 'one', 'political', 'movements', 'control', 'armed', 'forces', 'vice', 'versa', 'then', 'establish', 'totally', 'irreversible', 'dictatorship.Irreversible', 'well', 'maybe', 'not.The', 'film', 'can', 'always', 'become', 'deaf', 'run', 'away', 'start', 'own', 'development', 'other', 'country', 'state', 'also', 'industrialists', 'prophesizing', 'profiteers', 'may', 'get', 'fight', 'death', 'then', 'others', 'will', 'come', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'recuperate', 'whole', 'treasure', 'chest', 'film', 'not', 'allude', 'political', 'mode', 'democratic', 'management', 'development', 'Just', 'be', 'prophet', 'will', 'win', 'election', 'till', 'new', 'prophet', 'out', 'be', 'sure', 'intruder', 'will', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'will', 'be', 'job', 'when', 'one', 'claim', 'victory', 'Democracy', 'permanent', 'rotation', 'false', 'prophets.AlleluiaJacques', 'COULARDEAU']",There Will Be Blood

His Character, Daniel, was my favorite.  I wanted to like him so bad.  The way he went about his life, the passion he had for his work, His unquenchable thirst for success were qualities they made me root for him.  But, and this was what made him such a rich character, his flaws were so overshadowing, I couldn't look past them and embrace him in the movie.My other favorite was the young H.W.  He played did such a masterful job in the role, that I liked him immediately and that never changed from beginning to end.This movie is heavy on drama and story, and light on humor, action, and anything else that hyptnotizes the masses today.  It truly is a GREAT movie, and it's one that should be seen and talked about for years to come.",4,A Gem for those who love complex Characters,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,1259,"['Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'Oil', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', 'complex', 'story', 'kept', 'attention', 'start', 'finish.The', 'music', 'was', 'great', 'mood', 'created', 'music', 'made', 'feel', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'moment', 'would', 'change', 'course', 'whole', 'movie.For', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'Good', 'Great', 'had', 'be', 'actors', 'characters', 'portrayed.Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'was', 'masterful', 'deserved', 'oscar', 'Character', 'Daniel', 'was', 'favorite', 'wanted', 'like', 'so', 'bad', 'way', 'went', 'life', 'passion', 'had', 'work', 'unquenchable', 'thirst', 'success', 'were', 'qualities', 'made', 'root', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'rich', 'character', 'flaws', 'were', 'so', 'overshadowing', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'past', 'embrace', 'movie.My', 'other', 'favorite', 'was', 'young', 'H.W', 'played', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'role', 'liked', 'immediately', 'never', 'changed', 'beginning', 'end.This', 'movie', 'heavy', 'drama', 'story', 'light', 'humor', 'action', 'anything', 'else', 'masses', 'today', 'truly', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'talked', 'years', 'come']",There Will Be Blood
1124352,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00104QSOM,Jason,"[0, 2]","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) is a nearly emotionless man, a business first prospector and oil man who will do whatever it takes to be rich.  He comes off at times a bit possessed by the concerns and desires of becoming a filthy rich oil baron, at others a somewhat caring man, including his son H.W. Plainview in nearly all his business meetings and speeches with land-owners.A mysterious young boy comes to Plainview one day with tales of cheap oil land for sale in California.  He seems interested in a quick buck, but also willing to hand over the whereabouts of land that could provide Plainview untold riches.The small town Plainview was told about is Little Boston, and therein lives Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a very contradictory man.  Pious yet greedy, interested in the church's prosperity but also his own stardom, perhaps a televangelist before the advent of television, Eli yearns for the power that Daniel already has and demands from others.The movie does a great job of displaying the incredibly harsh, dangerous life of a miner at the turn of the last century.  In this trying environment, a man will do anything for what he covets.  The juxtaposition of two powerhouse characters, who seemingly share aspirations as well as vices, is destined from the very beginning to cause a clash of wills.  Once each character is made to publicly display their flaws - Daniel's failures as a father and Eli's blasphemous nature - there is no turning back.There Will Be Blood is a good movie, but it's not as great as it's made out to be.  It gained Hollywood's flavor of the month shortly after its release, and Daniel Day Lewis is the best of his career and deserving of every accolade, but it's far too slow in short spells for it to be a truly epic movie.",4,A drama as dark as oil,1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,1768,"['Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'nearly', 'emotionless', 'man', 'business', 'first', 'prospector', 'oil', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'be', 'rich', 'off', 'times', 'bit', 'possessed', 'concerns', 'desires', 'becoming', 'filthy', 'rich', 'oil', 'baron', 'others', 'somewhat', 'caring', 'man', 'including', 'son', 'H.W', 'Plainview', 'nearly', 'business', 'meetings', 'speeches', 'land-owners.A', 'mysterious', 'young', 'boy', 'Plainview', 'one', 'day', 'tales', 'cheap', 'oil', 'land', 'sale', 'California', 'interested', 'quick', 'buck', 'also', 'willing', 'hand', 'whereabouts', 'land', 'could', 'provide', 'Plainview', 'untold', 'riches.The', 'small', 'town', 'Plainview', 'was', 'told', 'about', 'Little', 'Boston', 'therein', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'very', 'contradictory', 'man', 'Pious', 'yet', 'greedy', 'interested', 'church', 'prosperity', 'also', 'own', 'stardom', 'perhaps', 'televangelist', 'advent', 'television', 'Eli', 'yearns', 'power', 'Daniel', 'already', 'demands', 'others.The', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'displaying', 'incredibly', 'harsh', 'dangerous', 'life', 'miner', 'turn', 'last', 'century', 'trying', 'environment', 'man', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'what', 'juxtaposition', 'two', 'powerhouse', 'characters', 'who', 'seemingly', 'share', 'aspirations', 'as', 'well', 'vices', 'destined', 'very', 'beginning', 'cause', 'clash', 'wills', 'Once', 'character', 'made', 'publicly', 'display', 'flaws', 'Daniel', 'failures', 'father', 'Eli', 'blasphemous', 'nature', 'turning', 'back.There', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'gained', 'Hollywood', 'flavor', 'month', 'shortly', 'release', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'best', 'career', 'deserving', 'accolade', 'far', 'too', 'slow', 'short', 'spells', 'be', 'truly', 'epic', 'movie']",There Will Be Blood
1124353,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B00104QSOM,Jason Horsley,"[20, 41]","Being a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson, my expectations were high for this flick, but alas, it did not deliver. Brilliantly directed by Anderson, with a phenomenal central performance by Daniel Day Lewis, I think the problem with the film is at a fundamental and conceptual level. The work is ambitiously themed, but Anderson hasn't taken the time--or perhaps didn't have the desire--to draw us into the story or the characters. Magnolia was an epic, ambitious work also, but it was on a human scale, and Anderson never seemed to be reaching for his effects. There Will Be Blood is another matter: it's all reaching, but it comes back empty-handed. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel, the film tells the tale of oil man Daniel Plainview, a man without substance, and apparently without heart or soul, driven by mysterious forces (forces that are never revealed), whose only passion is for oil. Plainview doesn't appear to be all that interested in profit, even, and although he is a ruthless businessman, the impression the film gives is that this is more a point of principle than actual greed. We are never given a clue as to what might be behind such a principle, however, or behind the character's stubborn, almost inhuman drive.The trouble with There Will Be Blood is that, if you place a hollow man at the center of your movie, you are likely to wind up with a hollow movie. Daniel Day Lewis carries the film on his sinewy shoulders, and he keeps us gripped by the sheer magnetism of his presence; but the script doesn't provide much context for his performance, and the character seems to be almost entirely the actor's creation. Long as the film is (158 minutes), Anderson doesn't use the time to establish his characters, or appear to care about building suspense. He seems to consider such conventions beneath him, and the result is fuzzy, muted, shapeless and meandering. Individual scenes are often strong--the film is gorgeously photographed--and there's certainly a dark poetry and lyricism to the film; but because there's no central thread to tie the scenes together, and without much narrative or character drive, the various episodes just hang in a void. Since we have no clue as to what drives the central character, there is nothing to drive the scenes forward either. Violent confrontations--between Plainview and the preacher, Ely, between Ely and his father, and the final murder--should be intensely disturbing but somehow fail to move us. Anderson doesn't make us feel the tensions that lead up to these scenes, so they appear to come out of nowhere; they seem overwrought, faintly ludicrous. Inside such a dramatic vacuum, Lewis' performance--intense as it is--becomes often blackly amusing: Plainview seems not only psychotic but absurd. Yet we can't tell if he's meant to seem that way or not.For such a bleak and violent work, Blood is almost devoid of tension. And for all the care that has gone into the film's look, and despite the central performance, it's rather slack, even tedious. It's clear Anderson is aiming for something big, but I think the ambitiousness of his concepts has undone him (though this is presumably why the film is being praised so extravagantly). He's trying to paint the portrait of a soulless man, driven by greed or unfathomable obsession, whose complete lack of feeling for anyone or anything besides oil turns him, by steady degrees, into a psychopath. And he's probably aiming at a parable for our times, in which insane corporate greed strips the Earth of its blood and man of his soul. But the film may be too finely conceived: Anderson has forgotten to take the trouble to draw us into the story and make it dramatic, meaningful, and what's on the screen are his lofty intentions, but not much of a movie.There Will Be Blood left me entirely cold. I felt nothing for the characters, and besides Plainview there are no characters, really. There is the preacher Ely, who is faintly despicable but otherwise less than substantial, and Plainview's son, who barely says a dozen words throughout the film. The rest are shadows, and Anderson seems to have intended it this way (he has cast the film almost entirely with unknowns). And although Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing throughout, there is only one scene which gives us a glimpse of what is going on inside Plainview and allows us to see him as a human being (the scene when he admits to hating people). Mostly, he seems like some relentless force of nature, a golem, driven by sheer hatred. But there's nothing to account for this hatred: like everything else in the film, it seems to exist in a void.There Will Be Blood is a tale told by a genius, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Critics may beg to differ, but if so, I suspect they are responding to the film's intentions more than what it actually achieves. Since Anderson's film appears to be about something, even though it never connects with us emotionally, it's being treated with awe and reverence (with repeat comparisons to Citizen Kane). But I think this is Anderson's weakest film, and except for one or two scenes (such as when Plainview's son is deafened in a rigging accident), it's almost entirely lacking in the compassion, the humanity, which made his previous films so remarkable. There Will Be Blood appears to be a case of a filmmaker getting carried away by the grandiosity of his vision, being too busy mapping the forest to remember to plant the trees. It's the sound of one hand clapping.",2,One Hand Clapping,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,5492,"['Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'flick', 'alas',

1124355,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00104QSOM,Jean E. Pouliot,"[3, 6]","I was grinning with delight even before the first images of this incredible film appeared on the screen. The musical score -- an impressionistic mix of half-musical screeches and mechanical noises -- was an overpowering presence throughout the film. So much so that its occasional absence was jarring and unnerving. ""There Will Be Blood"" features a tour de force performance by Daniel Day Lewis as the monomaniacal oilman Daniel Plainview -- a man whose singleness of vision matches his surname. Indeed, Plainview has but one aim -- to become wealthy beyond imagining, to work devilishly hard to get there and to let absolutely nothing get in the way of his dream. Plainview is the epitome of the American character -- driven, relentless, brutal and dismissive of societal niceties, except insofar as they help him achieve his aims. His chief antagonist is Eli Sunday, the preacher son of a poor farmer. Sunday and Plainview each seek their own means to riches, and quickly become locked in a vicious pas-de-deux. Sunday needs Plainview to finance his church; Plainview needs Sunday's approbation to persuade his congregation to cooperate in his ventures. The tension between these two men becomes so overwhelming at times that I started to wonder whether there was an allegorical element going on -- religion v business -- or perhaps a commentary about the unholy alliance between commerce and the Cross in American culture.But TWBB is extraordinary on so many levels. The acting is superb. DDL molds his character into a natural force. His growling voice, perpetually sweaty face and cold eyes convey menace even when expressing the most banal of sentiments. The writing is phenomenal; the recreation of the turn-of-the-century Southwest is more than a little convincing. The depiction of the early, grueling methods of extracting oil from the ground is fascinating. The plotting never gives away the story arc, as periods of intensity and frenetic action are juxtaposed unpredictably against periods of reflection and preternatural quiet. There are many star performance in the film, but aside from DDL, kudos go to Dillon Freasier as Plainview's young, laconic son, H.W.

1124356,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B00104QSOM,Jeff  Farrow,"[1, 1]","This film is so complex, so different, so out of the norm that in order to objectively rate it, this viewer must ask: What if the movie did not have Daniel Day-Lewis in it? You see, this is a case where the actor so dominates the material that he makes it entirely his own. This is not to imply that he upstages or ""steals"" scenes--he doesn't have to. What I suggest is that it is basically a stunning one man tour de force and other characters are only in it to fill in certain scenes--and the thing about that is that's how Day-Lewis' character in the movie sees & relates to the other people around him. They are there to exploit one way or the other. [I also don't what to suggest that the other cast members aren't up to snuff, they are. You'd have to be very good in order to have the confidence to play opposite Day-Lewis.]This is a very dark fable about patriarchal capitalism in the early days of the 20th century, but it does not make polemical statements. That is, it's intention is not polemical, it's neither leftist or any way political. Some reviwers complained that there was no clear cut story line or coherence between scenes. I can see what they're saying, but I don't fully agree with them. True, there is a sort of a cinematic meandering in places, but then it's filled in with interesting cinemaphotography. More then this, the film's development is cyclical rather than linear, allegorical rather than literal. It is the only feminine presence in this almost exclusive male world based on image, power & domination.So what if...?To imagine this movie without the great actor is really inconceiveable. He IS the film. It's not often today that an American audience has the opportunity to see really great--like inspirational--acting. Day-Lewis has been compared to Olivier and it's fully deserved.

Incredible cinematography, and musical score (which should have been nominated for an Oscar).  The only reason I gave this DVD only 4 stars instead of five, was because the extras were very, very limited, especially for a 2-disc ""special edition"".

There's a consortium who believe he's the supreme filmmaker of the past 2 decades, and there are those who insist its all style over substance.  Me? Well, while I've long been allergic to Anderson's habitually unwatchable, pompous hipster-flicks-for-critics, I never discounted that there is an inherent talent.  Only, the end result frequently left me cold and indifferent.  Sorta limp.  So, I dived into `There Will Be Blood' expecting a long, laborious characteristic PTA endurance test never assuming I would be magnified and thoroughly engrossed by its epoch sweep.  It is visually stunning, to be sure, and the soundtrack by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is film-scoring-as-symphony; it impales you as if it's its own character.  As self-indulgent as Anderson's films are, he seems to imbue great performances from his actors.  Here is no exception, especially in Daniel Day Lewis - he is monumental; so few times in my movie-going experience has a character so morally repugnant so immersed my psyche.  His Daniel Plainview lists as one of the great screen characters.  Just hand him the Oscar now, as there hasn't been this colossal a performance by an actor in years.

It begins with shrieking strings and the sequencing really leaves you breathless. Daniel Day Lewis behaves like a lunatic who is brutal and brilliant at once. His performance is SO wholesome. I say wholesome because it reminds me of the real people of the early 1900's who struggled, worked hard with their hands, and had soil, grit, and oil on their skins. All movie you really are mesmerized by the quirks and machinations that lie on and underneath Lewis' reflective face. I have never seen such a powerful performance on the big screen. As much as I respect Seymours performance from Capote, and older films such as the one I used in my title, I really can't say that I was shocked further from now. There were times during this movie when nothing else mattered in this film(which is why I really can't seperate the morsels of this movie into a more even handed review of the film itself). Danials performance was irresistable. I would predict that it is certain that he is the shoe-in for Best Actor in a Drama. Mail it to him if you have to.

1124362,A11423AYVMMC4K,B00104QSOM,"Jeremy G. Snyder ""Darkstalker""","[1, 8]","--WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD--This is the question I thought of near the end when the preacher Eli met his horrifying fate.  I was reluctant to see this film in theaters because I read that it was based on an Upton Sinclair novel.  Upton Sinclair of course being made famous as the author of ""The Jungle"" which supposedly showed horrifying depictions of the meatpacking industry which of course had no verifying evidence to them besides his few weeks as a socialist with preconceived notions about big business.  See my review of his novel ""The Jungle"" for an interesting history lesson.  At the same time though, I'm a huge fan of filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson.  His previous four films, ""Hard Eight"", ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"", and ""Punch Drunk Love"" were beautifully crafted and thoughtful works (""Magnolia"" in my opinion being his best film, even compared to this one).  So eventually I decided to wait to see it on DVD.The result is genuine surprise.  The movie doesn't at all come off as being some radical anti-capitalist screed at all.  The film could easily just be made about some politician or government bureaucrat (in fact, some of his speeches to townspeople throughout the film almost sound like many political rallies and addresses today).  It comes off more as an exploration of human greed and vanity then anything else, which exists in all systems.  Daniel Day Lewis is remarkable as Daniel Plainview, who isn't at all some caricature as some fatcat capitalist boss.  In the beginning we do see him working and laboring hard in order to get ahead.  When one of his employees dies in the film, he calls off production for a day.  And he does genuinely come to love his son whom he adopted from a man who died in a tragic accident (despite his protest at the end that he only needed a cute face in order to sell).If one sees Paul Thomas Anderson's previous films, one notices that many of his characters are often at war with themselves.  ""Hard Eight"" featured Philip Baker Hall having a deep friendship and love for John C. Reilly despite his dark secret that he murdered the father of John C. Reilly's character.  ""Boogie Nights"" featured Heather Graham trying to obtain her G.E.D. despite her background as a porn star and being insulted for it in the beginning as well as her desire for a mother figure.  Also, Don Cheadle is shown in the movie wanting to start up a successful audio equipment store but being unable to gain a loan because of his background as a porn star.  ""Magnolia"" in turn featured Tom Cruise playing a machoistic motivational speaker who secretly felt saddened by his mother's passing from cancer and his father's having never visited her.  Juliana Moore was the second wife of his father who married him only for his money but grew to love him and felt guilt over it.  ""Punch Drunk Love"" of course had the shy and timid Adam Sandler at war over his shyness and weakness versus his burgeoning love for Emily Watson's character.  Ultimately after looking over these films, it makes since for PTA to pursue ""There Will Be Blood"" as its about Daniel Plainview's war with his business interests and his distrust of most human beings (at one point even claiming that he hates most people and doesn't see anything to like when he looks at most people) versus his love for his son and struggle to find something good in humanity.  He clearly loves his son yet abandons him after his son goes deaf because he doesn't know how to cope with his son's deafness.  Doesn't know how to tell him that he loves him.  In the end, he also doesn't know how to react to his son's leaving with his wife and starting up his own oil business in Mexico.  Ultimately he pushes everyone away because of his seeming inability to trust and cope with humanity (though perhaps mostly his own) that he ends up murdering the preacher Eli Sunday in a horrendous climax and remarking in the last line of the film ""I'm finished"", which I took to mean that he felt that that was the end of his life.  He believed that he was going to be arrested, tried for, and found guilty of murder since he had pushed everyone away, including perhaps the one good thing he had in his life, which was his son (coincidentally it's when he becomes separated from  his son both times in the film that he ends up murdering someone).Eli Sunday is also perhpas an examination of the problems with greed in the story.  Granted he doesn't wind up a murderous psychopath like Plainview does and his murder at the end is tragic, but looking back on it, he isn't completely innocent since the only times he seems to have come forward to Plainview was when he wanted something in return.  After Plainview's son becomes deaf, Eli approaches him and what does he say?  Does he express his condolences, ask what he can do to help?  No, he asks where the $5,000 is that Plainview offered to pay him.  At the very end then, he returns from years of missionary work and investments to find Daniel Plainview passed out on the bowling alley floor and what does he do?  Does he ask why he was passed out on the floor of his indoor bowling alley?  Ask where his son is?  Ask how he is?  No, he asks if he would like to buy some land that he aquired and was trying to sell in order to cope with the Depression.  He wanted to sell it to Plainview at $100,000 plus the $5,000 that Plainview owed him with interest.  He was inconsiderate to the fact that a man whom he said was his friend was passed out on the floor of his indoor bowling alley.  Granted he didn't deserve his fate in the end, but he wasn't innocent of a little greed himself perhaps.I have only two complaints against this film.  First, after his son, H.W., befriends the town girl, the movie flash forwards nearly ten to fifteen years in the future with them married and his son approaching his father to express his desire to leave the business and start his own business in Mexico.  Plainview becomes cold-hearted at this point and we don't know why.  Didn't Plainview even try to learn sign-language all those years in order to communicate with his son?  What disagreements did the father and son have that eventually would lead to the split?  Did something happen personally between the two or in Plainview's life to lead to this?  It's rather a mystery that leaves Plainview's descent into madness and murder believable (we're talking Daniel Day-Lewis here) yet perplexing and incomplete.  The second is that none of Paul Thomas Anderson's regulars are in here.  In his previous four films, he often had some actors and reappear in different films such as Juliana Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, etc.  Where are these faces here?  It would have been nice to see some of them just to help remember that this is a Paul Thomas Anderson film and not exclusively a Daniel Day-Lewis film.",5,Does Eli Sunday think that God will forgive

We are in no way endorsing the purchase of said DVD, but merely offering an opinion of the film. You may acquire the DVD as you please and where you wish. This information must not be disclosed to any outside parties. Let us begin:1. Daniel Day Lewis - This actor never ceases to amaze us viewers. His performance alone is enough reason to view the film.2. P.T. Anderson - This director presents a film so haunting and serious that it recalls the work of Kubrick and Welles in its aesthetic. This film is possibly his best work.3. Jonny Greenwood - This composer provides amazing music that certainly enhances the film. It was a smart choice by Anderson. Greenwood's contributions are enough reason to view the film.4. Greed - This deadly sin is one of the greatest motivations for Lewis' character in this film. It is portrayed in a much different way than Michael Douglas did it in ""Wall Street"". Day Lewis was the man for the job in this particular case.5. Daniel Plainview - This main character will soon become a timeless classic, to be mentioned with the best of them. He is sort of a Villian's Hero, doing good for the worst of us. He really succeeds at his goals, which are less than noble.6. Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) - This supporting character is one of the best parts of the film. As frantic and crazed as any great Crispin Glover role, Eli Sunday is simply amazing. He is the leader of the Church of the 3rd Revelation!7. Oil! - This screenplay is adapted from the book Oil! and is epic. From the story to the dialog, not a minute is disposable in this film.8. Hate - This emotion is the other great motivation for the main character. It is the center of much of the plot developments as well as the greatest quotes from the film. ""I have a competition in me.

I have not felt the desire to write a review on a movie in 8 years... until I saw this.  I started out thinking:  Blood?  Daniel Day Lewis ( DDL ) , cool.. he is a great actor, and I love his past work... however is what went down.  Well, there was some blood, twice?  and for what reason?  Who knows?  My major gripe:  over half an hour of this movie is spent showing how crazed and nuttty the Christians are.  the Christianity is portrayed as a bunch of loons, which is untrue!  It almost made me turn it off, to tell you the truth... it gave the impression of the ""political correct"" view of Christianity as seen by a socialist.  The director shows the preacher healing with his hands.... yelling crazily, .. calling on Jesus to save you, as if it was some sort of CULT or crazy group.  DDL's character was made to profess Jesus, and he rolls his eyes and acts as if he is being raped!  or even beaten in the face... yes, he gets slapped in the face by the ""mean old Jesus professing person"".  Why is Jesus and anyone who believes in Jesus constantly made to be the bad guy in movies - ESPECIALLY THIS ONE?  SPOILER ALERT :  the mean old JESUS person is the ONE of the 2 people that "" THERE IS BLOOD "" from.  He dies at the end, by the hand of DDL ' the hero "" yay.  yay for the Jesus hater.  Clap clap.  .....DDL proclaims "" I am finished ""  after he kills the preacher that he just forced to deny GOD.  He made him deny God louder and louder about ten times in a row, then he beats he head in.... wow.  how nice.  it's an anti Christian movie.  AVOID THIS DRIVEL.  I wish that DDL had not been in this movie and therefore I would not have ever had a desire to see it nor waste my time.

1124370,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00104QSOM,J from NY,"[5, 6]","""There Will Be Blood"" is an excellent example of what a director can do when he grafts together epic literary tales (""King Lear"", ""Oedipus Rex"") and compacts them into one tragic tale.  Paul Thomas Anderson must have had a lot of fun (maybe) skimming the proverbial froth from innumerable tales of the tragic ""great"" man and transforming them into this tour de force of tragedy.Daniel Day-Lewis deserves an award for his performance as this hollow, ambitious and sadistic man who arrives on the scene with no origin.  He doesn't talk; he growls.  He doesn't walk; ravages the land he walks on with a proud aggression.  He wants money and he wants oil.This brings him into conflict with perhaps the most despicable character in the film (yes, more despicable than Plainview): the Preacher Eli.  A narcissistic, money hungry con artist who even physically resembles a snake, his heart does not reside in Logos or Divine Truth but in money.  One thing I did not like about this film at all was the constant mockery of the mere idea of God's existence--because there's one fraud playing a huge part in the film, Anderson has to engage in cliched Starbucks cinematic modernity?  (Which is one of the reasons ""No Country For Old Men"" is a better film: it is not about the madness of one titanic figure, it is about fate and the ultimate).Plainview, for all his considerable business skills, is essentially a demented and angry misanthrope.  I'd disagree with reviewers (Roger Ebert being one of them) who saw no mercy in this guy.  He seems to care very much for his son H.W. until the end, until all the betrayals real and imagined have occured.  I had to laugh a few times when Plainview flips out, at one point telling a member of Standard Oil that he was going to ""visit him at his home and cut his throat in the middle of the night"": all the guy did was suggest that, as a millionaire, he could devote more of his time to his son.  His spontaneous convulsions of rage are both amusing and horrifying.I expected something to change in Plainview's fate midway through the movie for some reason.  It never did.  Things get worse and worse until he is finally worse off, even, than Charles Foster Kane.  And more dangerous.A finely crafted movie.

We Americans love our confidence men & women & when we are not busy giving them our money we love to watch news stories about them on TV.  This movie has 2 confidence men both oil salesmen:  One selling crude & the other snake.  Fortunately for us one of them (crude) is played by Daniel Day-Lewis who has been staring us down since scratching his way along the side of a car in SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY.  Here he gives us orotund John Huston vocals with cadences & pauses that would make Christopher Walken stomp with envy.  Paul Dano as the snake oil salesman has a few fine moments when he conveys his character's astonishment over how much money can be made off people whose unthinking & greed for 'pie in the sky' make them an easy source.  The supposed tension in the movie is the war these 2 have to best the other & to prevail.  There are big confrontations like those in Verdi's IL TROVATORE where the brothers (here the characters are brothers 'under the skin') act out their hate toward each other.  Paul Thomas Anderson, the director, doesn't seem to be interested in character or narrative.  He's all professionalism.  He has the mechanics of movie making down pat & his movies are often exciting & impressive.  But all his characters are just that--- characters bordering on grotesques.  And he confuses insight with confrontation.  After a while you realize almost none of his characters are likeable & all the ranting is just noise.

The story is interesting and engaging; I thoroughly enjoyed witnessing Daniel's rise.  The ending of the film was brutal and had an amazing ""milkshake"" speech/monologue from Daniel; in fact, There Will Be Blood works off of its engaging dialogue, despite being wordless for the first 10 minutes, which is complimented by the brilliant acting. Daniel Day Lewis shows his versatility and dedication to character with this magnificent performance, while Paul Dano held his own and gave an equally impressive performance; they really worked great together like in the scene where Daniel and Eli first meet, when Daniel is humiliated by Eli as he joins the Church of the Third Revelation, and their final conversation. The cinematography is amazing, the film is shot beautifully. I really enjoyed the music, it matched the epic atmosphere and tone. The performances, cinematography, and music perfectly blend together to immerse you into this world, and I love it.The Bu-Ray has great picture and sound quality.

Yet, the entire film eventually skyrockets with shocking twists that are amazingly accurate depictions of mining life.""There Will Be Blood"" is set in the early 1900s, with Daniel Plainview, a prospector who hits paydirt with his first oil platform. Soon enough, he builds an oil derrick, and eventually builds a strong company. After one of his workers dies, he adopts the man's son.Daniel becomes a big oil tycoon, and begins to build up an empire with the help of a man named Paul Sunday. Paul informs him of the oil below the surface of Signal Hill, California. Daniel builds a stable oil company, after paying Paul's brother, Eli, for his church.Then things go wrong. Daniel's son, H.W., is left deaf after an oil derrick explosion. Daniel also meets a strange man who says that he is Daniel's brother. And, of course, Eli keeps asking for more money. And what happened to H.W's mother?There are many strange conspiracies left unsaid in the artsy film ""There Will Be Blood."" Daniel Day-Lewis pulls off a great performance as an oil tycoon, caught in the empty mining community in which he earns most of the profits.Strangely enough, Day-Lewis has no wife. In fact, there are hardly any females to be seen in the movie, leading to unusual socio-sexual changes within his life. In particular, he befriends a man who identifies himself as Daniel's brother. The man is pretty much Day-Lewis's only close friend for part of the series, because of his lack of interest in women, presumably caused by his hatred of his mother. Because of the forbidden homosexual tone which this film takes later, tensions rise quickly between the two.He also has problems with Eli, a preacher in the town, and his family. Daniel has to pay Eli to keep his claim to the oil well. However, Day-Lewis hardly gives a hoot for Eli's religious services, which leads to a fanatical transformation.Paul Dano pulls off a stunning performance as Eli, the evangelical preacher. Ignored by the miners, he decides to attract the attention of the rest of the town through his sensational sermons. Daniel watches the sermons with scorn, but hardly realizes that his ignorance has led to Dano's erratic behavior.The ending, however, is an awesome array of excellent back talking between Dano and Day-Lewis. And while I never imagined that these characters would make such creative use of bowling balls and bowling pins, I enjoyed watching how overly fanatical the two tycoons were.This is a crazy film where nothing ever ends happy. This is a film about greed, but this is also a historically accurate depiction of early California life. Although we may see it as the most fantastic and devilish film of the year, it is also an extremely brilliant character study of the western mining community, with a lop-sided men-to-women population.

1124381,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00104QSOM,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","At the end of 2009, critics began releasing their ""Best Films of the Decade"" lists and There Will Be Blood was number one for both Peter Travers and Michael Phillips, among others. It would be to bold of me to call this one of the decade's best films, but what director Paul Thomas Anderson has created with There Will Be Blood is a big, grand film rarely seen today with a towering performance by its star Daniel Day-Lewis.I do not need to divulge the plot to you. Day-Lewis plays oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano plays fire-and-brimstone preacher Eli Sunday. I could describe the plot for you, but it's unnecessary, not simply because you likely already know about it but because this is a film that is not about plot...It's about evoking time, character, and emotions. No dialogue is spoken in the film for the first 14 minutes and it's remarkable what Anderson is able to express simply through images.Paul Thomas Anderson, never without ambition, was at his most ambitious with this film. Working with a vast landscape and a brilliant cinematographer (Robert Elswit, who won an Academy Award for his work here), Anderson easily evokes the early 1900s that a man like Plainview would inhabit and he doesn't mind taking a moment to linger on the vast setting he's working with. Jonny Greenwood's musical score is so unique and fits this film so well; it's larger-than-life, epic, and sinister. Anderson immerses his audience so completely into this time, this atmosphere, and it's Greenwood's score dictates the mood...It's masterfully made, but it's not just the workings behind the camera that made this film receive its acclaim.Daniel Day-Lewis won his second Academy Award for this film and rarely has an actor delivered a screen performance of this caliber. This is a performance that transcends mere acting, where Day-Lewis is (and not for the first time) not just playing Daniel Plainview but becoming the man. It's much more of a transformation than a performance and it's one of the more fascinating performances I've ever seen. The voice, mannerisms, and the insanity he's capable of expressing with a single look is remarkable. Hardly anything Day-Lewis brings to this character suggests he's acting and it's no small feat to make such a towering, larger-than-life figure wholly believable and real. Who else could have brought such intensity and believability to the ""milkshake"" speech?Dano is effective too as both Paul Sunday and Eli Sunday and he stands his ground against Day-Lewis. There isn't a weak link anywhere in the performances, but it's Day-Lewis' show and he keeps his stranglehold on it throughout.There Will Be Blood is only three years old, but it can already be evaluated as timeless. There's such a grand scope of creative vision at work here that the film's faults (if it has any) can't be picked up on with the naked eye. The film is a masterpiece, one that grows richer with repeat viewings and it's one of the few films I know will still be watched and discussed thirty years from now.GRADE: A",5,A Masterpiece of American Cinema,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,3036,"['end', '2009', 'critics', 'began', 'releasing', 'Best', 'Films', 'Decade', 'lists', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'was', 'number', 'one', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'Michael', 'Phillips', 'others', 'would', 'be', 'bold', 'call', 'one', 'decade', 'best', 'films', 'what', 'director', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'created', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'big', 'grand', 'film', 'rarely', 'seen', 'today', 'towering', 'performance', 'star', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis.I', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'divulge', 'plot', 'Day-Lewis', 'oilman', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'fire-and-brimstone', 'preacher', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'could', 'describe', 'plot', 'unnecessary', 'not', 'simply', 'likely', 'already', 'know', 'film', 'not', 'plot', 'evoking', 'time', 'character', 'emotions', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'film', 'first', '14', 'minutes', 'remarkable', 'what', 'Anderson', 'able', 'express', 'simply', 'images.Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'never', 'ambition', 'was', 'most', 'ambitious', 'film', 'Working', 'vast', 'landscape', 'brilliant', 'cinematographer', 'Robert', 'Elswit', 'who', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'work', 'here', 'Anderson', 'easily', 'early', '1900s', 'man', 'Plainview', 'would', 'inhabit', ""n't"", 'mind', 'taking', 'moment', 'linger', 'vast', 'setting', 'working', 'Jonny', 'Greenwood', 'musical', 'score', 'so', 'unique', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'larger-than-life', 'epic', 'sinister', 'Anderson', 'audience', 'so', 'completely', 'time', 'atmosphere', 'Greenwood', 'score', 'mood', 'masterfully', 'made', 'not', 'just', 'workings', 'camera', 'made', 'film', 'receive', 'acclaim.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'won', 'second', 'Academy', 'Award', 'film', 'rarely', 'actor', 'delivered', 'screen', 'performance', 'caliber', 'performance', 'mere', 'acting', 'where', 'Day-Lewis', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'playing', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'becoming', 'man', 'much', 'more', 'transformation', 'performance', 'one', 'more', 'fascinating', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'insanity', 'capable', 'expressing', 'single', 'look', 'remarkable', 'Hardly', 'anything', 'Day-Lewis', 'brings', 'character', 'acting', 'small', 'feat', 'make', 'such', 'towering', 'larger-than-life', 'figure', 'wholly', 'believable', 'real', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'such', 'intensity', 'believability', 'milkshake', 'speech', 'Dano', 'effective', 'too', 'Paul', 'Sunday', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'ground', 'Day-Lewis', ""n't"", 'weak', 'link', 'anywhere', 'performances', 'Day-Lewis', 'show', 'stranglehold', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'only', 'three', 'years', 'old', 'can', 'already', 'be', 'evaluated', 'timeless', 'grand', 'scope', 'creative', 'vision', 'work', 'here', 'film', 'faults', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'naked', 'eye', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'richer', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'know', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'watched', 'discussed', 'thirty', 'years', 'now.GRADE']",There Will Be Blood

I am really surprised by all of the 5 star movie reviews, as I felt the movie was just average. The only above average category would be in acting, particularly Daniel Day-Lewis.The movie slowly, and I mean slowly, starts with Plainview (Lewis) down in a hole chopping at rock and finding some oil. During the first 20 minutes, dialogue nonexistent, we get to watch Plainview become obsessed with oil and his interaction with his son. The movie progresses a few years ahead and apparently Plainview has been successful in oil and is more greedy than ever for more leases and land to conquer. Basically, this IS the cycle that takes you from the beginning to the end (at a very bloated 2hrs. 30min. +).Perhaps the most troubling part is the relationship between Plainview and his son. For the early part of the movie, the relationship is close and he treats his son like his best friend. Then a period of years goes by and an accident happens, causing Plainview to basically abandon his son. Then his son comes back everything is fine, and then it flashes ten years into the future and Plainview is showing full hatred of his son again. If the director was trying to show Plainview as a complete jerk, he succeeded, but the movie would have been much stronger had the relationship been constant, while everything else was happening around them. Obviously, there were enough scenes to show that Plainview was a not-so-great person, that the dissolution of his relationship with his son was overkill.As to Daniel Day-Lewis' acting, it is superb and the best part of the movie. He plays a conflicted character, who you may like one minute and detest the next. The other actors play their parts well, particularly the actor who plays the son and the young, rather crazy minister.The overall pacing and plot seem to be the major issues, not to mention a dull, uninspired score. (It has one of the most annoying sections where it literally grates on your nerves and sounds more like a sound effect than music).

1124394,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00104QSOM,K. Driscoll,"[3, 8]","Some people have already hailed this as a masterpiece topping nearly all films in history.  I saw one recent list of the greatest movies ever made that put There Will be Blood as number two, following onlyCasablanca.  Perhaps that kind of message is somewhat consistent with the film's themes of false prophets and capitalist hype.  Time will tell if this movie deserves that kind of glorious praise I suppose, but I will agree without a shadow of a doubt that among the many tall trees in 2007, There Will be Blood is the tallest.  It is an astounding achievement and P.T. Anderson (Boogie Nights,Magnolia) has officially settled into all of his massive potential.  He had not made a movie in five years but has always shown flashes of brilliance.There Will be Blood is apparently based to some degree on the Upton Sinclair novelOil!.  The movie tells the tale of a silver miner named Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) who stumbles upon oil deposits in one of his mines.  The first part of the film shows us how he gradually refines his drilling techniques and how he eventually creates a massively successful oil enterprise.  One of his expeditions into a small town suspected of having vast oil reserves is framed in greater detail and introduces us to Eli (Paul Dano), a faith healer and head of the Church of the Third Revelation.  Many other significant stories involving Plainview's adopted son and a half-brother he didn't know he had, also portray the moral dilemmas he faces, but it is his dance with Eli that is more fascinating and layered than many cinematic conflicts I can think of.  Blind faith and devotion, whether it be in God or money, so easily devolve to greed, dishonesty, and self-destruction.  This is a dark movie with an incredibly powerful screenplay.Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead put together the music and thesoundtrackis as effective as we've come to expect from a P.T. Anderson movie, as is the first rate cinematography from Anderson partner Robert Elswit, who has put together a wonderful career even outside of Anderson's movies.  However, stylistically this is restrained by comparison to Anderson's earlier films and I actually think it serves to make the film far more effective.  Almost everyone loves the hip boomingsoundtrackand Tarantino-esque dialogue ofBoogie Nights,  but it would not have worked in a serious film like this, and Anderson seems to have grown out of caring about that sort of thing.  Good for him, I really enjoyed forgetting I was watching a movie and instead stepping into the cutthroat world of Daniel Plainview for two and a half hours.The one element of this film that will be remembered in the annals of cinematic history is of course the Oscar winning, and more than Oscar worthy, performance of Daniel Day Lewis.  This guy is never less than great in anything he has ever done and seems to come out of seclusion every three to five years or so to show the rest of the world what acting really is.  I'm hard-pressed to think of a performance that is definitely better than this one.  He is a remarkable and gifted actor, and showcases that here more than anywhere else.  On the other hand, I think Paul Dano's performance will be overlooked.  The young actor was highly praised in many circles for his performance in 2006'sLittle Miss Sunshine, a dramatically different performance in a dramatically different movie, but here is even better and is definitely one to look out for.There Will be Blood offers great visuals, great performances, and significant insights that some viewers may be sensitive to.  I felt a subtle contemporary social commentary that points to overwhelming hypocrisies happening in our modern world.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.",5,The Best Film of 2007,1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,3738,"['people', 'have', 'already', 'hailed', 'masterpiece', 'topping', 'nearly', 'films', 'history', 'saw', 'one', 'recent', 'list', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'put', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'number', 'two', 'following', 'onlyCasablanca', 'Perhaps', 'kind', 'message', 'somewhat', 'consistent', 'film', 'themes', 'false', 'prophets', 'capitalist', 'hype', 'Time', 'will', 'tell', 'movie', 'kind', 'glorious', 'praise', 'suppose', 'will', 'agree', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'many', 'tall', 'trees', '2007', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'tallest', 'astounding', 'achievement', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Magnolia', 'officially', 'settled', 'massive', 'potential', 'had', 'not', 'made', 'movie', 'five', 'years', 'always', 'shown', 'flashes', 'brilliance.There', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'apparently', 'based', 'degree', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', 'novelOil', 'movie', 'tale', 'silver', 'miner', 'named', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'who', 'oil', 'deposits', 'one', 'mines', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'how', 'gradually', 'drilling', 'techniques', 'how', 'eventually', 'massively', 'successful', 'oil', 'enterprise', 'One', 'expeditions', 'small', 'town', 'suspected', 'having', 'vast', 'oil', 'reserves', 'framed', 'greater', 'detail', 'introduces', 'Eli', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'faith', 'healer', 'head', 'Church', 'Third', 'Revelation', 'Many', 'other', 'significant', 'stories', 'involving', 'Plainview', 'adopted', 'son', 'half-brother', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'also', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'dance', 'Eli', 'more', 'fascinating', 'layered', 'many', 'cinematic', 'conflicts', 'can', 'think', 'Blind', 'faith', 'devotion', 'be', 'God', 'money', 'so', 'easily', 'devolve', 'greed', 'dishonesty', 'self-destruction', 'dark', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'screenplay.Jonny', 'Greenwood', 'Radiohead', 'put', 'together', 'music', 'thesoundtrackis', 'as', 'effective', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'movie', 'first', 'rate', 'cinematography', 'Anderson', 'partner', 'Robert', 'Elswit', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'wonderful', 'career', 'even', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'However', 'stylistically', 'restrained', 'comparison', 'Anderson', 'earlier', 'films', 'actually', 'think', 'make', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'hip', 'boomingsoundtrackand', 'Tarantino-esque', 'dialogue', 'ofBoogie', 'Nights', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'serious', 'film', 'Anderson', 'have', 'grown', 'caring', 'sort', 'thing', 'Good', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'forgetting', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'instead', 'stepping', 'cutthroat', 'world', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'two', 'half', 'hours.The', 'one', 'element', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'annals', 'cinematic', 'history', 'course', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'more', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'guy', 'never', 'less', 'great', 'anything', 'ever', 'done', 'come', 'seclusion', 'three', 'five', 'years', 'so', 'show', 'rest', 'world', 'what', 'acting', 'really', ""'m"", 'hard-pressed', 'think', 'performance', 'definitely', 'better', 'one', 'remarkable', 'gifted', 'actor', 'here', 'more', 'anywhere', 'else', 'other', 'hand', 'think', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'overlooked', 'young', 'actor', 'was', 'highly', 'praised', 'many', 'circles', 'performance', ""2006'sLittle"", 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'dramatically', 'different', 'performance', 'dramatically', 'different', 'movie', 'here', 'even', 'better', 'definitely', 'one', 'look', 'out', 'for.There', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'great', 'visuals', 'great', 'performances', 'significant', 'insights', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'sensitive', 'felt', 'subtle', 'contemporary', 'social', 'commentary', 'overwhelming', 'hypocrisies', 'happening', 'modern', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough']",There Will Be Blood

Only the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as Eli Sunday save ""There Will Be Blood"" from being a terrible film.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson empties out a bag of tricks in order to make this movie appeal to award-giving crowd, thus eliminating the interests of most movie-goers.  Lewis is a greedy, driven oilman intent on getting the most profit from his victims by using his own down-to-earth sales pitch and cute son.  Dano plays a preacher intent on doing the same thing, but through conning the crowd as a fire and brimstone preacher.  The two lock horns when Plainview buys Sunday's family farm from his father at a bargain and then blowing off Eli and his requests for money for the church.The film runs about an hour too long and is littered throughout with long shot sequences, erratic music and, in actuality, very little blood.  Many have accused Anderson of either stealing from Stanley Kubrick or paying homage to him through this film.  Either way, he's no Stanley Kubrick.Lewis and Dano play their respective characters very well.  Plainview is a complete jerk, even to his son.  There is a very matter-of-factness in Lewis' delivery of lines that makes the character worth struggling through the plodding script to see.  Dano's Sunday is just as vicious, but in a much more sinister and silent way.  Only when he's preaching does he really raise his voice.  He also has a violent streak, as the viewer will witness during an interaction with his father.Overall, this film is average.  There is nothing entirely terrible about it but there's nothing entirely great either.  Dano and Lewis do great jobs with what they're given, but it's not enough to give ""There Will Be Blood"" more than three stars.

By watching it now in blu-ray it only enforces the fact that he is a great actor. The story of the movie is just ok in my opinion, but what is interesting is the tense and classic moments of negotiations between Lewis and his ""victims"". Unfortunately there are plenty of people out there just like his character, and those are what we are used to call ""successful"" - perhaps, but since I can only give credit to ambition (it's a good quality) and not greed, this is not a story line that interests me as much.As a norm in almost all Hollywood productions, every time a character is doing something ""bad"" he/she is wearing a cross.

1124401,A3LZBOBV9H1HDV,B00104QSOM,"Kris King ""Kristopher""","[0, 0]","""There Will Be Blood"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: An epic tale of family, faith, power and oil set on the incendiary frontier of California's turn-of-the-century petroleum boom. The story chronicles the life and times of one Daniel Plainview, who transforms himself from a down-and-out silver miner raising a son on his own into a self-made oil tycoon. When Plainview gets a mysterious tip-off that there's a little town out West where an ocean of oil is oozing out of the ground, he heads with his son, H.W., to take their chances in dust-worn Little Boston. In this hardscrabble town, where the main excitement centers around the holy roller church of charismatic preacher Eli Sunday, Plainview and H.W. make their lucky strike. But even as the well raises all of their fortunes, nothing will remain the same as conflicts escalate and every human value--love, hope, community, belief, ambition and even the bond between father and son--is imperiled by corruption, deception and the flow of oil. The cast led by Daniel Day-Lewis (in a brilliant Oscar-nominated, career-best performance as Daniel Plainview) is excellent! The directing and screenplay (based on Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!"") (Oscar-nominated) by Paul Thomas Anderson (who also wrote and directed ""Punch-Drunk Love"" (2002), ""Magnolia"" (1999), & ""Boogie Nights"" (1997) is brilliant and this is his best film to date!

The casting by Cassandra Kulukundis (who also did the casting to ""Breach"" (2007), she also did the casting to ""Punch-Drunk Love"", & ""Magnolia"") is excellent!

With this new found fortune, he's able to buy up numerous ranches and farmland so he can continue drilling.

When Plainview goes to research the land he meets Paul's twin Eli.  Eli helps to negotiate a fair price for his fathers land.  However, he asks the atheistic Plainview for a donation to help his church.  This is where the vengeance comes in.  Plainview is a stubborn man who won't take no for an answer.

1124410,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00104QSOM,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 4]","Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar in 2008 for his performance in this film. I can well understand why. Cast as an unscrupulous oil tycoon in the early part of the 20th century, he paints the portrait of true greed and ruthlessness.  He has no relationships, no family and no regrets as he cheats people out of their land in order to build oil wells.  There is no dialogue for the first 15 minutes of the film.  We see him prospecting for gold in a makeshift and dangerous shaft.  He's alone, and when he has a fall that breaks his leg, he pulls himself out of the shaft in grit and determination.  His characterization is set then.Later we see him working on a mine with a small baby in a basket.  He tells everyone this is his son and that his wife has died in childbirth, but throughout the film we never meet any woman in his life and there is no back story at all about the child.  He calls the child his son and is grooming him to be an oilman and there are some very poignant scenes between these two.  And then, an accident happens and his son becomes deaf.  The father does what he thinks is right, but leaves the son hating him forever.Into this mix comes a young evangelical preacher, played by Paul Dano, whose family sold oil to the oilman.  This young man is a religious zealot and wants say a prayer to dedicate the first oil well that is dug on the land.  But the oilman disrespects him and embarrasses him instead and this leads to a lifelong hatred and competition between them both, resulting in a rather confusing and violent conclusion to the film.The acting was superb.

Like other great films; Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey etc, it is not for everyone.  The pacing is deliberate, the characters complicated, the music bizarre, the moral of the story cloudy.  But what a story.We follow the career of Daniel Plainview- misanthrope, miser, oil-man- as he gains a fortune and loses everything that makes it worth having.  Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is astounding, one of the most complete transformations in modern cinema.  He perfectly captures the few moments of peace and humanity that Plainview has before rejecting human-kind as imperfect.  And Paul Dano as Plainveiw's nemesis, the self-made (or self-deluded) preacher Eli, holds his own against the veteran actor.  On one level, There Will Be Blood can be seen as the struggle between religion and capitalism, a clash of the titans with Plainview and Eli locked in a battle from which neither can back down.  Very few films create such perfectly crafted characters with such real, moving and dramatic conflict between them.  Their battle is at once epic and relatable as they continue to one-up the other in a series of betrayals and humiliations.With such over-the-top performances, the whole movie could easily have degenerated into a camp-fest, but the restraint and calm of the cinematography and the deliberate pacing balances everything.  Under the painstaking direction of Paul Thomas Anderson the film becomes a series of peaks and valleys, with periods of peace and violence as perfect as a Beethoven symphony.But again, Beethoven isn't for everyone.  And if none of the above appeals to you, by all means, please skip it.  At nearly three hours it would be a painful experience to anyone who wasn't in the mood for it.  I was awed by There Will Be Blood, I think its one of the greatest American films ever made.  But its not the movie for a night of relaxing in front of the tv.

1124414,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B00104QSOM,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[0, 5]","This movie did not appeal to me.  It is a overly long epic on a greedy, crazy, deceptive man, Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day Lewis).  The movie is based on the 1927 Sinclair novel Oil!  It begins in 1902 showing Plainview as a mineral and silver prospector in the Southwest.  The first 30 minutes drag on as there is little dialogue. After one of his workers dies in an accident, Plainview adopts the man's orphaned son.  We find out later the mother also died in childbirth.  He names the boy H.W. (Dillon Freasier) and uses him to establish himself as a family man and set a good image.Several years later, 1911, Plainview meets Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) who comes to his office with a proposal.  He knows of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California and will let Plainview in on the secret for $500.  Plainview agrees travels out with H.W. asking to camp and quail hunt with his son.  After dinner with the Sunday family one evening he asks to buy the land at $3,700, which he feels is a good deal.  Paul's twin brother Eli (also played by Paul Dano) understands Plainview's deceptive offer and holds out for $10,000.  He wants part of his father's money to found a church.  Finally Plainview agrees and oil producton on the Sunday land begins.Eli asks Plainview to bless the oil well at the dedication.  Plainview, for some reason feels this is a power-play, and grabs Mary Sunday (a family member who does not like to pray) and dedicates the well holding her hand.Soon an on-site accident kills a worker, deafens his adopted son, and also catches the rig on fire.  You wonder if Eli should have blessed the well.Later a visitor (Kevin J. O'Connor) comes to Plainview's home saying he is his half brother and needs work.  Plainview takes him in, and H.W. discovers flaws in his story an attempts to kill him by setting his bed alight.  Plainview is upset at his boy's behavior and sends him to a school in northern California.The movie then goes into deals and offers with Union and Standard oil, a murder, deals and insults from Eli.  Later, in 1927, H.W. (Russell Harvards) finishes school and marries his childhood sweetheartr Mary Sunday (Colleen Foy).  His father, Daniel Plainview lives in a mansion alone.  He is obsessed with business and alcohol.  H.W. (through a sign language interpreter) to let him establish his own business.  This means disolving their partnership.  Plainview makes fun of his son's deafness and tells him of his origins and that he was adopted.Later, Eli visits Plainview, now head of a larger church and a religious radio show.  He needs money and goes to Plainview.  The odd ending shows that Plainview wants Eli to confess he is a false profit and God is a superstition. Eli finally does so after much humiliation.  The setting is the mansions bowling alley.  More anger and dialogue about land and oil ensue between Eli and Plainview, then Plainview uses an oversized straw to drink Eli's milkshake from across the room.  Then an angry Plainview chases Eli around the room with a bowling pin beating  him to death with it.  The only servant in the house comes down to see what is going on.  Plainview says ""I'm finished"" and the film ends.So the film bores, shows the worst of capitalism, greed and deception, and the ending is bizarre.  Daniel Day Lewis does a fine acting job, but the insane greedy character was not worth watching despite all the awards he and the movie received.",2,"Greed, Deception, and An Odd Ending -",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,3459,"['movie', 'did', 'not', 'appeal', 'overly', 'long', 'epic', 'greedy', 'crazy', 'deceptive', 'man', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'movie', 'based', '1927', 'Sinclair', 'novel', 'Oil', '1902', 'showing', 'Plainview', 'mineral', 'silver', 'prospector', 'Southwest', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'drag', 'little', 'dialogue', 'one', 'workers', 'dies', 'accident', 'Plainview', 'man', 'orphaned', 'son', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'mother', 'also', 'died', 'childbirth', 'boy', 'H.W', 'Dillon', 'Freasier', 'establish', 'family', 'man', 'set', 'good', 'image.Several', 'years', 'later', '1911', 'Plainview', 'Paul', 'Sunday', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'who', 'office', 'proposal', 'oil', 'deposit', 'family', 'property', 'Little', 'Boston', 'California', 'will', 'let', 'Plainview', 'secret', '500', 'Plainview', 'travels', 'out', 'H.W', 'asking', 'camp', 'quail', 'hunt', 'son', 'dinner', 'Sunday', 'family', 'one', 'evening', 'buy', 'land', '3,700', 'good', 'deal', 'Paul', 'twin', 'brother', 'Eli', 'also', 'played', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Plainview', 'deceptive', 'offer', 'out', '10,000', 'part', 'father', 'money', 'found', 'church', 'Finally', 'Plainview', 'agrees', 'oil', 'producton', 'Sunday', 'land', 'begins.Eli', 'Plainview', 'bless', 'oil', 'well', 'dedication', 'Plainview', 'reason', 'feels', 'power-play', 'grabs', 'Mary', 'Sunday', 'family', 'member', 'who', 'not', 'like', 'pray', 'well', 'holding', 'hand.Soon', 'on-site', 'accident', 'worker', 'adopted', 'son', 'also', 'rig', 'fire', 'wonder', 'Eli', 'should', 'have', 'blessed', 'well.Later', 'visitor', 'Kevin', 'J.', ""O'Connor"", 'Plainview', 'home', 'saying', 'half', 'brother', 'work', 'Plainview', 'H.W', 'discovers', 'flaws', 'story', 'attempts', 'kill', 'setting', 'bed', 'alight', 'Plainview', 'upset', 'boy', 'behavior', 'school', 'northern', 'California.The', 'movie', 'then', 'deals', 'Union', 'Standard', 'oil', 'murder', 'deals', 'insults', 'Eli', 'Later', '1927', 'H.W', 'Russell', 'Harvards', 'school', 'marries', 'childhood', 'sweetheartr', 'Mary', 'Sunday', 'Colleen', 'Foy', 'father', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'mansion', 'alone', 'obsessed', 'business', 'alcohol', 'H.W', 'sign', 'language', 'interpreter', 'let', 'establish', 'own', 'business', 'disolving', 'partnership', 'Plainview', 'fun', 'son', 'deafness', 'origins', 'was', 'adopted.Later', 'Eli', 'Plainview', 'now', 'head', 'larger', 'church', 'religious', 'radio', 'show', 'money', 'Plainview', 'odd', 'ending', 'shows', 'Plainview', 'Eli', 'confess', 'false', 'profit', 'God', 'superstition', 'Eli', 'finally', 'so', 'much', 'humiliation', 'setting', 'mansions', 'bowling', 'alley', 'More', 'anger', 'dialogue', 'land', 'oil', 'ensue', 'Eli', 'Plainview', 'then', 'Plainview', 'oversized', 'straw', 'drink', 'Eli', 'milkshake', 'room', 'Then', 'angry', 'Plainview', 'Eli', 'room', 'bowling', 'pin', 'beating', 'death', 'only', 'servant', 'house', 'down', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'Plainview', ""'m"", 'finished', 'film', 'ends.So', 'film', 'bores', 'worst', 'capitalism', 'greed', 'deception', 'ending', 'bizarre', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'insane', 'greedy', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'awards', 'movie', 'received']",There Will Be Blood

Perhaps well executed, but why anyone would go to the trouble of producing a story like this for the big screen is beyond me.  I guess it's sort of a politically driven critique of business, religion and the darker elements of human nature but it really offers no profound insights into its subject matter.Very nihilistic, so I guess if that's your bag you might ""enjoy"" it, just make sure you are lying on a bed of nails while watching to get the full effect.Basically it's a Scrooge story with the Ebenezer characters (you get two for the price of one, the oilman and the preacher) portrayed in a much more exaggerated fashion and zero redemption.  What a hoot.  If one of the points of the story was supposed to be single-minded ambition can be costly, it fails to show any sort of counterpoint that can be achieved by striking a more reasonable balance in your life.  There is no Fezziwig character in this gloomfest.So overall the story is so outrageously negative I found it hard to believe.  By so intensely focusing only on the darkest moments of the human experience the movie comes across as artificial and inconsequential.  More balance between good and evil would have made for a much better and effective story.I think in reality someone as unbalanced as the Plainview character would not have the opportunity to bludgeon his opponents to death the way the movie portrays.  Even the most desperate acquaintances would stay well away...  which is what I would advise you to do with this pathetic film!The even sadder part is the attention to detail and expense that went into the sets, acting and portrayal of the early oil production process all go to waste.

A similar performance to Gangs of New York, he nailed the man we refer to as Plainview.We start at the beginning with about 15 to 20 minutes of silence. He has struck oil. We fast forward to when the boy has grown to about 8 or 9 and he is helping his father make deals for oil as they are already extremely wealthy. After the meeting of the townfolk to see if they will agree to do business with him as he does all of his own drilling, a man approaches Plainview stating that there is money to be made in his hometown, the oil is right at the surface. Paul Dano is excellent as both characters. You may remember him from The Girl Next Door. With that, Plainview sets out to this town which will make him a much more fortunate man. There are many trials and tribulations to which our very complex characters experience.To the end we will put closure on the many different occurences from many different angles.

In yet another Oscar-winning performance, Day-Lewis plays turn of the century oil prospector Daniel Plainview. The film also won the Academy Award for best cinematography, and was nominated for best adapted screenplay, best art direction, best editing, best sound editing, best directing, and best picture.Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel Oil!, this movie follows our protagonist Plainview in his relentless quest for oil and riches in early 1900's California. He runs up against a young evangelical preacher who disagrees with both his motives and his methods for ravaging the land for more and more oil.This is one of my favorites. Everything about this film is flawless. The story, acting, visual style, characters, and music all work together so well to pull you in and take you back to oil prospecting times and make it exciting. Jonny Greenwood's music is a fantastic work of film scoring, and serves so well to underscore the story of heartbreak, hatred, and greed playing out on screen. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is one for the ages, as nearly every major review will tell you. What most reviews neglect to mention is the masterful (and criminally un-nominated) performance by Paul Dano as Eli Sunday.

I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people.""- TWBB's protagonist, Daniel Plainview.I remember when I first saw There Will Be Blood. It was about a month after the film came out on DVD in 2008 and my mother and I, on a whim, ordered the film On Demand just to see what it was. Within its first few minutes, it showed us its main character Daniel Plainview, hard at work and attempting to find some kind of trace of oil in the ground. Despite the injuries he sustains, he continues to go at it. This sequence only has one or two pieces of dialogue, coupled with an utterly horrifying and yet strangely beautiful score by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, but it already helps establish WHAT kind of character Plainview is: He is a massive determinator, willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants.However, as the film progresses, this maybe one of the only few positive aspects of his personality.Let's get this out of the way: There Will Be Blood is not a pleasant film. The title alone should state exactly what it is. It's the kind of movie that outright shows us the ugliness of people and does not look back. While the film does show some redeeming qualities in others in the form of love and to an extent kindness, we see the worst aspects of people all over the place. Our greed, anger, how we trick others in to doing what we want, deceit, lies, zealotry and quite a few more. Though for all of its ugliness and hatred, its a film that will never leave in a positive way.Set early 1900's and partially based on the Upton Sinclair novel Oil!, Blood tells the tale of oil man Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) and his son HW Plainview (Dillon Freasier). Plainview, over the years, has set up a successful oil business and doing pretty well for themselves. A young man by the name of Paul Sunday (Paul Dano, who plays two parts in the film) comes to him and tells Daniel that they have oil where he comes from. Plainview agrees to see what all of the fuss is about and slowly starts to bud heads with Paul's twin brother Eli (Paul Dano again), a charismatic but over-zealous follower of Christianity. As the film progress, things start to spiral out of control and explode (both figuratively and literally) for everyone.I remember what my reaction to the film was the first time I saw it. It was something to the equivalent of a resounding ""Wow"" of sorts, simultaneously wondering what the hell I just watched and yet completely understanding it all. The film also was my introduction to both Paul Thomas Anderson and its lead Daniel Day Lewis, both of whom are wildly regarded as some of cinema's most impeccable talents and it most certainly shows.From a directorial standpoint, Blood has a ballsy degree of confidence from start to finish. The aforementioned opening with little to no dialogue to some sequences with characters violently attacking each other to even those quiet moments between Daniel and his son all have a surprising tightness to them. None of it feels out of place or some kind of mood whiplash. Not a single shot is wasted, either. Every scene makes sense for it to be there. This is a character study first and foremost and save for the segment which cuts to HW in his early adulthood, we never leave Plainview's perspective.Speaking of Daniel Plainview, this guy is easily one of cinema's most memorable characters. Plainview comes off as a darker version of a typical Living Legend: His accomplishments, power, influence, charisma. But as the film progresses, his true nature and personality slowly starts to show up: His unrelenting greed, absurd selfishness and finally, his mental and moral decay. Compare his dignified demeanor at the beginning of the film to his crazed nature at the end. But all of this is fascinating and, in the darkest way possible, a joy to watch because of Lewis's performance. There's a very good reason why Lewis won his second Oscar for this. Even when he performs at times laughable antics to harass others, such as humiliating fellow Oil executives or playing along with Eli's song and dance, it still manages to spark fascination. There's even some subtleties to the performance, such as Lewis walking with a limp throughout the film, reflecting that Plainview never healed from his earlier injury.But Day-Lewis isn't alone in giving out excellent performances. Paul Dano, as the over-the-top preacher Eli Sunday, delivers a great rivalry between Day-Lewis's character and creates, what I felt anyway, an excellent love-to-hate vibe from him. The actor who plays Daniel's son, Dillon Freasier, does a very good job, adding a small flicker of innocence to the nastiness of the film. An older version of HW, played by Russell Harvard, also leaves a lasting impression on the viewer though I won't say how for the sake of spoilers.While many films of today rely on computer generated trickery for beautiful visuals, its always nice to see some films either go all the way with practicality or do a mix and match. Blood, for its look, went for an all natural look to help suck the viewer into the film's time period. Cinematographer Robert Elswit provides stark imagery and haunting landscapes. The most standout part, which has been used in promotional material, is when an oil derrick lights on fire, setting an hellish tone to the scene and Plainview being covered in oil with a strange mix of horror, fascination and sense of accomplishment on his face.The musical score - as aforementioned by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood - is very haunting as well and comes off as something that would fit more with a horror film than it would with a period drama. But considering the tone and feeling of madness that carries the film, it fits incredibly well, especially when viewing it a second time. There's also several excerpts from different composers, such as Johannes Brahms and Arvo P&auml;rt, that get the job done in very fitting - albeit also very dissonant - parts..If there were any complaints I could give, there would be two. The first would be some of the acting. While the performances are nothing short of incredible many times over the course of the film, sometimes it can border on self parody, especially with Paul Dano's fanatical devotion and Day-Lewis scenery chewing insanity. And then there's the deliberate pacing of the film, which will irk and possibly divide viewers. This isn't the kind of movie to play in the background while you're vacuuming the house; If you intended to watch There Will Be Blood, you will sit down and pay attention.There Will Be Blood has already earned its place in cinema and pop culture due in part to its infamous ""Milkshake"" scene (which is in of itself is a spoiler). Granted, not to the absurdly popular levels of cinematic juggernauts like The Avengers or The Dark Knight. I would even argue to those who seek out the film will be very surprised and maybe even turned off for what they would be in for: A slow moving Period Piece crossed with elements of Psychological Horror story. Whatever the case, even with its darkest of depths, There Will Be Blood will always hold a place in my cinema loving heart.",5,Cinematic Amorality,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,7571,"['Director',

1124428,A1AYN3IIUNQCIA,B00104QSOM,"Melanie Edwards ""book worm""","[1, 4]","Watching There Will Be Blood is definently an interesting experience. I can't quite put my finger on it but there is just something so hypnotic about this film that, from the very first scene, you can't help but become oddly entranced by it all. From the almost silent fifteen first minutes to the strangely engrossing oil scenes, the slighty hysteric rantings of crazed young preacher Eli, even the almost curve ball final act, you can't help want to see more and more of the film and when it does end, you leaves you sitting there, almost tempted to want to rewatch the film all over again. Again, I can't figure out what it was but whatever it is, it just leaves you with that satisfied movie going experience.We are taken into the life of the charasmatic and slightly eccentric Daniel Plainview, who describes himself as a professional oil man. Already having made a impressive buisness of himself, he is approached by a young man who gives him a tip that the town he lives in may have a vast underground oil supply. Seeing the opportunity at hand, he packs up his equipment and with his son H.W. in tow, sets off for the small town with great intentions in mind. Along the way, he makes himself a rival in the form of Eli Sunday, twin brother of the boy who gave Daniel the tip off. A overbearing bible thumper, he has the same intentions of greatness as Daniel and as the movie goes on, there rivalry slowy grow as they try to make their goals into reality.First thing is first, all the acting is definently on par. Paul Dano (probally best known from his role in Little Miss Sunshine) brings a fire and intensity to his characters, his big scenes never boarding as over the top or zanny but just the right amount of fantatasism and passion. And as for Daniel Day Lewis, a very well known character actor with some pretty odd methods of preparing for a role, once again submerges himself into this role. He spits fire, his eyes burn with intensity, never does his performance go over to the hammy side, which in a role like this could have very easily went over the top. Oscar worthy, definently.Paul Thomas Anderson has always been a personal favorite of mine, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, both super diffrent films and each one so very diffrent in there own mind, and each on effective in their purpose. This was his much needed comeback film after the pretty average Punch Drunk Love, once again taking care in his work and producing an engrossing story that has you hooked from the beginning. Everything else is also great, Cinematography just pops, Art Direction is just the right amount of grit, everything in this film comes together.My one main critisism would probally have to be that this film may have been a bit to over hyped. Reading reviews, I've probally glimpsed the word 'Masterpiece' used in almost every single one. I wouldn't go to far as to call this film a masterpiece, I could probally name about twenty other films in the past eight years that can easily out surpass this film in terms of quality and impact. It kind of suffered the same effect as No Country for Old Men, but unlike the later film which I felt was severly overrated, this one actually deserved most of its praise.Other then that, it's definantly one of the films to see from 2007.

1124429,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00104QSOM,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[129, 160]","Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"" is a big bold, eccentric, crazy film, based on Socialist author Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel ""Oil,"" which proposes the thesis that Capitalism brings about positive change but change that ultimately destroys the future: a double edged sword that cut both ways. So much of ""TWBB"" reminds me of Nathanial West's Hollywood Novels of the 30's like ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" and ""Day of the Locust,"" novels filled with grotesques and grotesque, outlandish actions. Plainview would fit right in with West's fringe dwellers.At the center of ""TWBB"" is the towering performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview, who at the beginning of the film (1898) is a not very successful Silver miner who ends up by film's end as a just barely holding onto reality, whacked out richest Oilman in California. Lewis's performance is feral, animalistic, and fierce...all squinting eyes, guttural voice and slouching posture: Lewis feels every word he utters throughout his body. He pulls out all the stops and creates a character that resonates with pathos and humanity but his Plainview is also a symbol of a time when it was possible to get ahead by setting goals, setting out into a ""new"" world, grabbing yourself by the seat of your pants and forcing your will upon others and getting ahead: making money, saving, spending wisely...attaining the so-called American Dream in the sense that James Truslow Adams wrote about it in his ""Epic of America"" in the 1930's. Lewis's Plainview is Evil personified (""I despise success in others"") yet writer/director Anderson has allowed him to have a positive inner life primarily centered on his son who he papalbly adores focusing all of his available adoration on him.Let no one dissuade you from this: Lewis's performance here is on par with Brando's in ""Streetcar"" or Paul Newman's in ""Hud."" It's a performance that actors will be referring to for many years to come.Plainview's main antagonist is Paul Dano's Eli Sunday, a young preacher who creates the Church of the Third Revelation in the oil fields. Thomas sets up a battle between the two: the supposedly ultimate Capitalist and the lowly man of God: a kind of Battle of the Titans: Capitalism vs. Evangelism. Their big, penultimate confrontation is as big and bold and over-the-top as even Anderson's own Shower of Frogs in ""Magnolia.""""There will be Blood"" grabs you from the first frame and doesn't let you go until the last frame of the last reel spools out. It is poetic, thoughtful, beautiful in many ways as well as ugly, real, ghoulish in others. Because Anderson's vision here is so aggressively solemn and ominous even Calvinist,""There Will be Blood"" will naturally be misunderstood by many but ultimately this film will be remembered and revered for many, many years to come.",5,The American Dream,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,2809,"['Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'big', 'bold', 'eccentric', 'crazy', 'film', 'based', 'Socialist', 'author', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', '1927', 'novel', 'Oil', 'thesis', 'Capitalism', 'positive', 'change', 'change', 'ultimately', 'future', 'double', 'edged', 'sword', 'cut', 'ways', 'So', 'much', 'TWBB', 'Nathanial', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'Novels', '30', 'Miss', 'Lonelyhearts', 'Day', 'Locust', 'novels', 'filled', 'grotesques', 'grotesque', 'outlandish', 'actions', 'Plainview', 'would', 'fit', 'right', 'West', 'fringe', 'center', 'TWBB', 'towering', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'who', 'beginning', 'film', '1898', 'not', 'very', 'successful', 'Silver', 'miner', 'who', 'up', 'film', 'end', 'just', 'barely', 'holding', 'reality', 'whacked', 'out', 'richest', 'Oilman', 'California', 'Lewis', 'performance', 'feral', 'animalistic', 'fierce', 'squinting', 'eyes', 'guttural', 'voice', 'slouching', 'posture', 'Lewis', 'feels', 'word', 'body', 'out', 'stops', 'character', 'pathos', 'humanity', 'Plainview', 'also', 'symbol', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'possible', 'get', 'ahead', 'setting', 'goals', 'setting', 'out', 'new', 'world', 'grabbing', 'seat', 'pants', 'forcing', 'will', 'upon', 'others', 'getting', 'ahead', 'making', 'money', 'saving', 'spending', 'wisely', 'attaining', 'so-called', 'American', 'Dream', 'sense', 'James', 'Truslow', 'Adams', 'wrote', 'Epic', 'America', '1930', 'Lewis', 'Plainview', 'Evil', 'personified', 'despise', 'success', 'others', 'yet', 'writer/director', 'Anderson', 'allowed', 'have', 'positive', 'inner', 'life', 'primarily', 'centered', 'son', 'who', 'papalbly', 'focusing', 'available', 'adoration', 'him.Let', 'one', 'dissuade', 'Lewis', 'performance', 'here', 'par', 'Brando', 'Streetcar', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Hud', 'performance', 'actors', 'will', 'be', 'referring', 'many', 'years', 'come.Plainview', 'main', 'antagonist', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'young', 'preacher', 'who', 'Church', 'Third', 'Revelation', 'oil', 'fields', 'Thomas', 'up', 'battle', 'two', 'supposedly', 'ultimate', 'Capitalist', 'lowly', 'man', 'God', 'kind', 'Battle', 'Titans', 'Capitalism', 'Evangelism', 'big', 'penultimate', 'confrontation', 'as', 'big', 'bold', 'over-the-top', 'even', 'Anderson', 'own', 'Shower', 'Frogs', 'Magnolia', 'will', 'be', 'Blood', 'grabs', 'first', 'frame', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'last', 'frame', 'last', 'reel', 'spools', 'out', 'poetic', 'thoughtful', 'beautiful', 'many', 'ways', 'as', 'well', 'ugly', 'real', 'ghoulish', 'others', 'Anderson', 'vision', 'here', 'so', 'aggressively', 'solemn', 'ominous', 'even', 'Calvinist', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'will', 'naturally', 'be', 'misunderstood', 'many', 'ultimately', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'revered', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'come']",There Will Be Blood

I now feel that, without a doubt, Daniel Day Lewis is most definitely one of our great film actors of our time. His naturalistic, unguarded, venomous portrayal of unscrupulous oilman Daniel Plainview will leave you shaking, and i feel its one of the best portrayals of human greed ive ever seen on film. The first 15 to 20 minutes, theres absolutely no dialogue, as we see Plainview as a young driller in a group searching for oil. After that, we see him and a young boy he adopts as his own son named H.W., come to a small town called Little Boston, where they pose as quail hunters, but in actuality, are there to find oil at the property of Eli Sunday, brilliantly played by Paul Dano. Sunday is a young preacher, thought to be a spiritual healer. Without giving too much away, over time, Plainview and Sunday dont see eye to eye, both men have their own reasons for doing the things they do, and with Plainview, we see firsthand how greedy and spiteful and deranged he becomes as the years pass and his wealth grows. To say hes not a likeable man is an UNDERSTATEMENT, and you wonder if deep down he wants us to hate him as much as he says he hates all other people around him. He proves to be out for self and is willing to openly sacrifice all those near him for what he feels is rightfully his to claim. The script, the haunting score by Johnny Greenwood, which relies on strings that parlay a riveting sense of psychological tension even in low-key moments and the vast cinematography all combine to create a film that will disturb and penetrate you for two and a half hours.

This film really has everything you would possibly want in a film.Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day-Lewis) and Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) are absolutely made for each other. Plainview, a self described ""oil man"" who slowly evolves into a wealthy, shameless, greedy, psychopathic business man is constantly at odds with the manipulative preacher, Eli, and in their own way they turn this film about antiquated oil drilling into a film that is instead about two villains fighting each other. By the end of the film, the only one you will sympathize with is Plainview's son, who is stricken deaf after an accident and slowly comes to recognize and hate his father's selfishness.The greatest thing about this film is it's atmosphere and sense of period. The sets feel authentic, and even though this is a movie about greed and business the film maintains an almost surreal atmosphere that is thick with eeriness and suspense.If there's anything wrong with it, I'd say that it is a bit overrated.

Sounds like a movie about history, so what's this nonsense of a horror movie based on actual events?  The title sounds like a horror film, is it that?  No.  The score is like something out ofThe Shining [Blu-ray], could it be the mood?  No.In 2007 I pre paid for my oil and did a budget plan with a local company, my rate was $2.59.  On May 1st 2008 I was sent my new contract to lock into the a rate of $3.84 which I had to return by May 30.  On May 22, 2008 I received another letter saying they had sold out of oil in record time and my contract was void and they would send out new information.  On June 3, 2008 I received the letter stating I could lock in for $4.29 a gallon, for the avg I need that is $326 a month and $3,586.000 a year.  And I have a new house and don't use that much heat in comparison to others.  Oh, before arriving home to get the letter in the mail I stopped to fill up my gas tank at over $4 a gallon.  I've just set the stage for some real life horror or satire depending on how you see the glass.  Paul Thomas Anderson knowingly or unknowingly creates a character in Plainview  that can be used as a metaphor to mock the ridiculousness or our current state or to show the true horror of it.  As for the title in a revolution there is usually blood.

Ghosts or not that family's financial fears are real and hit home.MY IDEA:I read an article that stated that Nascar is suffering because these die hard fans usually travel all over to see the races but with large vehicles and what not they cant' afford it.  So here it is.  The biggest gas guzzlers have to be race cars, so what if Nascar boycotted itself.  Went on strike.  Those guys make pretty decent money and their fans are die hard.  More people might watch Sportscenter then the news and it plays about 20 times a day and each time would cover such a story.  Perhaps maybe just a well known well off racer.

Nevertheless, this movie was a big disappointment.  I had been looking forward to watching it for years but I found the movie tedious with me looking at my watch hoping that it was almost over for the last hour or so.  Normally I would have stopped watching a movie at the point but since Daniel Day Lewis was in it, I kept hoping that the film would improve.  It didn't.  The cinematography was stunning and the initial part of the movie depicting the early oil industry was fascinating.  However, as the movie continued into the eventual mental and moral decline of Plainview (Lewis), it lost me.

1124438,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00104QSOM,Miles D. Moore,"[1, 4]","There has never been a movie quite like Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood."" Its genre is virtually an oxymoron: it's an epic character study. Anderson keeps his focus fixed precisely on one character--Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), first seen as a lone prospector in 1898 and portrayed finally as a reclusive, filthy-rich oil tycoon in 1927. The bulk of the movie, however, takes place in 1911, as the velvet-voiced Plainview (his voice, as many reviewers have noted, a virtual ringer for John Huston's) attempts to bilk the residents of an oil-rich California desert town named Little Boston out of their land. Only three other characters in the film make any impression at all: H.W. (Dillon Freasier), Plainview's adopted son; Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), a seedy drifter who may or may not be Plainview's long-lost brother; and, especially, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a creepily beatific young evangelist who sets himself up as Plainview's chief antagonist. Some reviewers have described the plot of ""There Will Be Blood"" minutely, which is too bad. This is the kind of film that the less you know about it before you see it, the better--not because of any plot twists, but because the peculiarities of Plainview's character need to catch you by surprise to have their full impact. ""There Will Be Blood"" has been described as a portrayal of the evils of unrestrained capitalism, and that may be true; but in my opinion it is much more a study of the evils that unrestrained wealth can wreak on a human soul. I read a quote once, the gist of which was that whatever is in your character, money will bring it out in the extreme. This certainly is true of Plainview, who progresses, by almost impercepitble steps, from a happily hermetic existence to total cynicism and misanthropy. ""I look at people, and I see nothing worth liking,"" he confesses at one point. Certainly there is nothing worth liking about Plainview, particularly at the film's terrifying end; but as Anderson writes him and Day-Lewis plays him, he will leave you utterly astonished. Plainview is a spectacular monster, a character straight out of Balzac, Dickens or even Shakespeare, and he will haunt your imagination for a long time to come. Robert Elswit's sweeping photography captures a desert landscape as vast and arid as Plainview's soul; production designer Jack Fisk captures perfectly the dusty, dangerous poverty of Little Boston; Jonny Greenwood's audacious music score--supplemented by ironically uplifting selections from Brahms and Arvo Part--cuts the silence like a dagger, setting us up to receive the total apocalypse of a man that is Daniel Plainview. Dano, O'Connor and young Freasier give notably fine performances, but this is Day-Lewis' show, and he towers in it, and over it.",5,An astonishing film by any measure.,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,2780,"['never', 'been', 'movie', 'quite', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'genre', 'virtually', 'oxymoron', 'epic', 'character', 'study', 'Anderson', 'focus', 'fixed', 'precisely', 'one', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'first', 'seen', 'lone', 'prospector', '1898', 'portrayed', 'finally', 'reclusive', 'filthy-rich', 'oil', 'tycoon', '1927', 'bulk', 'movie', 'however', 'place', '1911', 'velvet-voiced', 'Plainview', 'voice', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'virtual', 'ringer', 'John', 'Huston', 'attempts', 'bilk', 'residents', 'oil-rich', 'California', 'desert', 'town', 'named', 'Little', 'Boston', 'land', 'Only', 'three', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'make', 'impression', 'H.W', 'Dillon', 'Freasier', 'Plainview', 'adopted', 'son', 'Henry', 'Kevin', 'J.', ""O'Connor"", 'seedy', 'drifter', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Plainview', 'long-lost', 'brother', 'especially', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'creepily', 'beatific', 'young', 'evangelist', 'who', 'up', 'Plainview', 'chief', 'antagonist', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'plot', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'minutely', 'too', 'bad', 'kind', 'film', 'less', 'know', 'see', 'better', 'not', 'plot', 'twists', 'peculiarities', 'Plainview', 'character', 'need', 'catch', 'surprise', 'have', 'full', 'impact', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'been', 'described', 'portrayal', 'evils', 'unrestrained', 'capitalism', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'opinion', 'much', 'more', 'study', 'evils', 'unrestrained', 'wealth', 'can', 'wreak', 'human', 'soul', 'read', 'quote', 'once', 'gist', 'was', 'character', 'money', 'will', 'bring', 'out', 'extreme', 'certainly', 'true', 'Plainview', 'who', 'almost', 'impercepitble', 'steps', 'happily', 'hermetic', 'existence', 'total', 'cynicism', 'misanthropy', 'look', 'people', 'see', 'nothing', 'worth', 'liking', 'one', 'point', 'Certainly', 'nothing', 'worth', 'liking', 'Plainview', 'particularly', 'film', 'terrifying', 'end', 'Anderson', 'Day-Lewis', 'will', 'leave', 'utterly', 'astonished', 'Plainview', 'spectacular', 'monster', 'character', 'straight', 'Balzac', 'Dickens', 'even', 'Shakespeare', 'will', 'haunt', 'imagination', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'Robert', 'Elswit', 'sweeping', 'photography', 'desert', 'landscape', 'vast', 'arid', 'Plainview', 'soul', 'production', 'designer', 'Jack', 'Fisk', 'perfectly', 'dusty', 'dangerous', 'poverty', 'Little', 'Boston', 'Jonny', 'Greenwood', 'audacious', 'music', 'score', 'supplemented', 'ironically', 'uplifting', 'selections', 'Brahms', 'Arvo', 'Part', 'silence', 'dagger', 'setting', 'receive', 'total', 'apocalypse', 'man', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Dano', ""O'Connor"", 'young', 'Freasier', 'give', 'notably', 'fine', 'performances', 'Day-Lewis', 'show']",There Will Be Blood

In this version, prospector Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) sets out to become an oil magnate in turn-of-the-century California. He aggressively obtains drilling rights from landowners under somewhat dubious terms and pays them a royalty. In 1911, a man from the town of New Boston sells Daniel information about oil on his family ranch. With his young son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), Daniel sets out to buy all the land he can get in New Boston before his competitors do. But his promises to bring prosperity to the town must compete with charismatic local religious demagogue Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) for the hearts and souls of the citizens.""There Will Be Blood"" is entertaining for about two-thirds of its 2 hour 38 minute run time. We spend the first 15 minutes watching Daniel prospect for silver and oil, to give you some idea of the pace. The story is not in any way realistic beyond the naturalistic production design, and the last third goes too far over the top to sustain credibility. As is typical of Paul Thomas Anderson, who wrote as well as directed this film, it's not clear just what the film is supposed to be. Every scene unfolds with gravity, but the endless power struggle between Daniel and Eli is black comedy. Daniel Day Lewis' Oscar-winning performance is not realistic, but rather an affected acting style that is suited to the film's dark humor and implausible behavior.We seem to have a black comedy and a character study that is hardly believable, presented as epic drama. It makes very little sense. Daniel Day Lewis' histrionics must carry the entire film. And they do. Daniel Plainview believes in single-minded ambition for its own sake, and his venom is something to see. The conflict with Eli Sunday is perversely amusing. And young H.W., buffeted about by his father's goals, evokes the audience's sympathy. Mind you, they are in a plot whose parts do not coalesce. And beyond the director's low opinion of oilmen and preachers, there is no point, and for a while I thought there would be no end. But most of it is entertaining, so this is a big improvement as Paul Thomas Anderson's films go.",4,"Another Unidentifiable, Pointless Film from PTA.

The film did not disappoint. With Daniel Day-Lewis in just about every scene for over two hours, the film gives us a portrait of an oil developer, Daniel Plainview, who knows who he is down to the marrow of his bones. He says at one point (and I'm paraphrasing) that ambition and success are insufficient for him. There is a malignancy roiling through his bloodstream, a drive to dominate and conquer others and to never be satisfied until he sees his competition defeated. As his name suggests, he has a very plain view of who he is and yet he is helpless to do anything about it. He is indeed a creature helpless in the face of his irrational impulses. The film's soundtrack and plot all serve to illuminate this internal malignancy that consumes the ambitious oil developer.

I truly care about which pictures are nominated, and usually a nomination alone will get me to want to see a movie.  Wow, I am so confused and disappointed.I just watched There Will Be Blood last night.  I will say ONE good thing about this film, and this is solely my basis for giving it 2 stars: Daniel Day-Lewis DID deserve the Oscar.  His acting and portrayal of a businessman sinking into his own madness and greed was spot-on.  I think he has a face that makes you pay attention, and you want to hang onto ever word.  I also just really like him, so maybe I'm biased.HOWEVER..........This movie was LONG, BORING, TEDIOUS, AND REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A PLOT.  Look, I'm not saying ""good"" movies need a ton of action and need to spoon-feed you, but this movie really left you saying, ""When WILL something happen to grab my attention?""  I completely understand that this was written as a character study - where watching and analyzing his movements, choices, and mannerisms was the key to truly appreciating the story.  THIS is why I thought he was remarkable - because he DID show the character he needed to.  I can also see the parallels between him and Eli Sunday, but I didn't think Eli was in it enough (God, it WAS almost 3 hours long, people!) to truly show the fall of both men into madness.  Not until the end (and I won't ruin it) did the director slap the parallel in your face.Ok, speaking of endings, I am pretty picky about endings.  I hated No Country For Old Men, and thought the absurd ending only made me hate it more.  The ending for There Will Be Blood, in my opinion, was actually quite entertaining albeit nerve-wrecking.  I quite enjoyed the ending, but it wasn't enough for the film to win me over.Another side note for people who have seen it:  What was the deal with the son?

He is a man willing to endure pain and humiliation to grasp more money, or more power.  As he quickly moves from gold to black gold, he becomes more powerful, and his ruthlessness and underhandedness become more and more apparent, combined with the charisma required to persuade landowners to part with the mineral rights of their property.  We learn about how he sees other people when he adopts a boy who he finds useful to put a kind face on his activities, and how he treats a man appears claiming to be his half brother.  The movie kicks into gear though when he meets an equally power hungry man in the unlikely form of the young faith healer and preacher, to whom he takes a seemingly instant dislike.  With the relationships with these three characters, we see his dilemna- his power is only something if he can pass it on, but when he sees only the worst in other people, how can he?  Who will be worthy of the three to take on his mantle..?The style of the movie has some stunning direction which tells us much of the story through scenes and images, rather than words, yet this is married with an intelligent, absorbing and uncompromising script.  The music is daringly inventive, although with me the jury is out whether it is a success or a distraction.Daniel Day-Lewis turns in yet another 100% authentic and believable performance, creating a chilling and yet at times charismatic character, and Paul Dano is remarkable as the young preacher.Sure, women are given little to no role in the story, and it is unremitting in its bleakness, at times feeling like it has been designed to within an inch of its cinematic life.  It's not going to be to everyone's taste..

Even after seeing director Paul Thomas Anderson's vision come to life in ""There Will Be Blood,"" you're not quite sure what to make of it.  Is it a character study of a complex man?  Is it a moral tale of what depths men will stoop to in the pursuit of money?  Is it a tale of good and evil, community?  Is it part heavy drama and part seriously twisted comedy?  Well, it might be a little bit of all these.  Watch it yourself to see what you make of it.Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a phenomenal performance--nuanced at times (something he really isn't known for) and over the top as you would expect.  His over the top moments though fit as his oil wildcatter subject, Daniel Plainview, is peeled back like an onion layer after layer until all that's left is this stinking rotten psycho inside...a complex and evil character indeed.  All performances are finely played and perhaps the most interesting things about the flick are tied between the cinematography and the script.  The writing is sparse allowing the characters to tell the tale through both action, word, and deed.Threaded throughout there is this issue of religion and what it does for people's motivations and how it's juxtaposed to a man almost without conscience.  The sense of community and religion even scratch Daniel's oil-slicked and slate hardened skin as it leads him to seemingly have a moment of regret in his relationship with his son.By the end of the movie, despite the title, there really isn't that much blood.  Comparing this to that year's other big Oscar nominated movies, Juno and No Country For Old Men...well it's a better flick than No Country and skillfully told with far less blood and Juno well...there isn't as many pregnant teenagers...but that's beside the point.The point is, see this flick.  By the time you arrive in the bowling alley, you won't know whether you are supposed to be laughing or horrified to the core.  And you don't really know who the Plainview character is which seems to be just what the director, actor, and writer intended.  A fine fine human study...this flick is.

There Will Be Blood is one of them, and is arguably the best effort that writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has ever put to celluloid, most notably thanks to the brilliant, Oscar winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as oil tycoon Daniel Plainview.  Plainview's rise is chronicled as he, along with his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), sets sights on an oil-rich land inhabited by the Sunday family, whose evangelist son Eli (Paul Dano) Plainview soon comes into conflict with.  There is even more going on in between all the proceedings, as Anderson presents an amalgamation of greed, love, redemption, and torment.  Not only is Daniel Day-Lewis a magnetic sight to behold, but every other performance (from Freasier, to Dano, to Kevin J. O'Connor, to Ciaran Hinds) are their own little miracles.  Everything else, from Anderson's direction, to brilliant and breathtaking cinematography, to a hair raising music score; all adds up to the modern day masterpiece that is There Will Be Blood.

The relationship between the oil industry and organized religion is also explored as a major plot-line in this film, with oilmen clearly coming out on top of the men of god.  Both of these points bear great importance in understanding the course of 20th century history both inside and outside America.  The one key point missing from this film that would have made it complete, is a tangent into Wall Street, showing how oil men eventually and universally put their money into financial speculation.

1124464,A3GAY5VH2LDFWK,B00104QSOM,"Patrick A. Kellner ""PAK""","[20, 28]","""There Will Be Blood"" screenplay and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, writer and director of ""Magnolia (New Line Platinum Series)"". Based on the book ""Oil"" by Upton SinclairThe Late 1800's: Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is prospecting for silver and failing. After blasting in his mine he finds oil instead of silver. Plainview is no longer a prospector but an ""Oil Man"" and one of the shrewdest businessmen ever portrayed. A few years of drilling for oil pass. A young man arrives who is willing to disclose the location of property rich with oil. So much that it is literally seeping out of the ground. Plainview's interest is peeked and after negotiating with the young man he is off to check out this prospect, but not dressed as an oil man.......There is absolutely no doubt that Daniel Day-Lewis deserved the Oscar that he received for his roll in ""There Will Be Blood"" but even with as spectacular a display as Day-Lewis gives us, it still wasn't enough to save this movie. It essentially comes across as a negative commentary on aspects of American culture that are important to many which are Capitalism and Religion. Plainview represents Capitalism in its darkest form as a businessman with no scruples about buying land out from under unsuspecting owners using false pretenses and carrying a fake son around to appear that he is a family man. Religion is represented by Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), who is an up and coming preacher who is portrayed as something of a snake oil salesman whose underlying motives are to improve his own situation with the tool of religion. I guess this should'nt be a surprise since the book that this movie was based off of is written by a socialist.The Good: The acting all around was great. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance was masterful and deserves praise. The production of the movie overall was great, from the sets to the costumes to the look of the movie. The only production value that was lacking was the music.The Bad: The story just didn't seem to go anywhere. The majority of the story takes place in one town and you watch Plainview milk it dry and make himself rich and that is about it. The movie is character driven and it is interesting to watch the shrewdness of the Plainview character but it just wasn't enough for me.The music and it's placement in this film were a mystery to me. There music itself is interesting but just felt out of place at all times. The sound and tone of this soundtrack would best be described as frantic and anxious. It seemed to me that since so little is happening in the film this uncomfortable music was inserted to create tension and mood since what was happening on screen couldn't convey it on its own. Music to help accent tension/drama/etc is fine but to create and maintain it is overboard. An example would be that at one point in the film Plainview is using surveying equipment to lay out a future pipeline which is not a very energetic or exciting scene. All the while in the background we have the frantic soundtrack wailing away like fingernails on a chalk board.Overall: Watch this movie if you want to view great acting. If you want to watch a great movie however, watch something else.",2,2 1/2.

1124465,A1ZMCLGK23FZIT,B00104QSOM,"Patrick Hodges ""Flame""","[3, 7]","Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis have collaborated to create something really special. ""There Will Be Blood"" is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's definitely my favorite of 2007.The highlight of the film is the acting. I can't even describe just how good Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is. His Daniel Plainview is such a complex, engrossing character. I can confidently say that this is one of the finest pieces of acting I've seen, possibly the finest. He walked away with pretty much every major lead actor award for his portrayal of the greed-driven oil man and it could not have been more well-deserved.Also, Paul Dano turns in a great performance as the creepy young charismatic pastor Eli Sunday. His character's battle with Plainview is one of the most interesting parts of the picture. The two men are so different, and yet so alike. Each are ambitious in their own way. Daniel's methods are fairly straightforward; he wants to get at people's oil as cheaply as possible in order to gain power and to make a fortune. Eli's motivations are a little more complex; he wants to use his position as a ""man of God"" and a ""faith healer"" to gain respect, honor, and ultimately (like Daniel) a fortune. But we never clearly discover if Eli is a phony. Whatever the case, he's clearly a giant hypocrite.There are a lot of other themes and interesting things going on. Everything just works so well. The cinematography is gorgeous. Anderson's direction is superb. The writing is top-notch. Jonny Greenwood's innovative score sets the mood perfectly for this dark oil epic.

1124466,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00104QSOM,Paul McGrath,"[35, 66]","If one were to take a quick glance at the biography--such as it is--of Paul Thomas Anderson, one would learn that he grew up in Studio City, CA;  that his father was the ""voice"" of ABC;  that he has no education beyond high school;  and, like Tarantino, that he learned his film craft from watching thousands and thousands of movie videos.  These are, of course, perfect credentials for one who is making a cartoon or a movie about pornography;  they would seem to be much less so for making a film having to do with American history.This one is about an oil-man--the rugged entrepreneurial oil-man of American myth and legend--and spans about a twenty year period in the American southwest of the early twentieth century.  Not surprisingly, with this director and his Hollywood background, the oil-man is portrayed as a hateful, evil clown.  His sole ambition is his lust for oil, and he uses everything important in his life to attain it.  He has not an ounce of morality and by movie's end we find that he is in fact a serial killer.  This, the movie would have us understand, is our heritage.The side story has to do with the oil-man's rather odd, long-term relationship with the Christian minister of the town.  Again unsurprisingly, the Christian minister is also portrayed in an unrealistic fashion.  In this case, he is a histrionic, prancing, strutting maniac--way too young--shrieking at his docile flock, and even slapping them around on occasion to git the divil outta'em.  And of course, by movie's end, we find that his religion actually means nothing to him at all, as he--while wearing a bright, silver cross around his neck--renounces his faith and his God for, you guessed it, a chunk of the black gold.Neither of these people even remotely resembles a real-life, early twentieth-century American, but to the film's credit, it remains consistent:  nobody else does either.  The townspeople look and act like they're brain-dead, standing out in the desert sun without hats on, listening dully to yet another harangue.  The landowner from whom the oil-man wants to lease property is so fervently religious he comes across as a buffoon.  The capitalists--the big four we are meant to know--are perhaps slightly more realistic, but only in the way of the hackneyed, Hollywood stereotype:  they wear suits and top hats and smoke cigars and harrumph, just like every other capitalist in every other movie since the dawn of film.There are many other ludicrous elements of this film and the plot leaves a whole slew of unanswered questions too.  Just how is spouting, burning oil from an oil well contained and managed anyway?  This would be one thing that might be interesting to know.  Where are the houses or the town that these townspeople live in?  Except for a couple of oil wells, a church and a desert, nothing else is shown.  Just what did the minister do that caused him to be so desperate for money?  It had to have been pretty horrible for him to react so outrageously.  What women did the oil-man lust after?  He was accused of this by the minister but the movie never even hints at it and there's barely any women in the film at all.  And why does everybody slap each other around so much?  Good lord, nobody seems to be able to simply walk up and say hello to someone without giving them a belt across the chops.  What is with these people?The more important question is, what is it with Hollywood?  This mediocrity gets nominated for an Academy award?  Nothing in it is real, nothing in it is provocative, nothing in it even remotely resembles any sentient human being's life experience.  Instead, it is a cartoon, a mish-mash of political correctness and historical revisionism, submitted to us by one who has spent his life in a dark room held spellbound by reel after reel of celluloid.",1,Fiction Based on Fancy,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,3815,"['one', 'were', 'take', 'quick', 'glance', 'biography', 'such', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'one', 'would', 'learn', 'grew', 'up', 'Studio', 'City', 'CA', 'father', 'was', 'voice', 'ABC', 'education', 'high', 'school', 'Tarantino', 'learned', 'film', 'craft', 'watching', 'thousands', 'thousands', 'movie', 'videos', 'are', 'course', 'perfect', 'credentials', 'one', 'who', 'making', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'pornography', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'so', 'making', 'film', 'having', 'do', 'American', 'history.This', 'one', 'oil-man', 'rugged', 'entrepreneurial', 'oil-man', 'American', 'myth', 'legend', 'spans', 'twenty', 'year', 'period', 'American', 'southwest', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'director', 'Hollywood', 'background', 'oil-man', 'portrayed', 'hateful', 'evil', 'clown', 'sole', 'ambition', 'lust', 'oil', 'everything', 'important', 'life', 'attain', 'not', 'ounce', 'morality', 'movie', 'end', 'find', 'fact', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'understand', 'heritage.The', 'side', 'story', 'do', 'oil-man', 'rather', 'odd', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'Christian', 'minister', 'town', 'Again', 'unsurprisingly', 'Christian', 'minister', 'also', 'portrayed', 'unrealistic', 'fashion', 'case', 'histrionic', 'prancing', 'strutting', 'maniac', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'shrieking', 'docile', 'flock', 'even', 'slapping', 'occasion', 'git', 'divil', ""outta'em"", 'course', 'movie', 'end', 'find', 'religion', 'actually', 'nothing', 'wearing', 'bright', 'silver', 'cross', 'neck', 'faith', 'God', 'guessed', 'chunk', 'black', 'gold.Neither', 'people', 'even', 'remotely', 'real-life', 'early', 'twentieth-century', 'American', 'film', 'credit', 'consistent', 'nobody', 'else', 'townspeople', 'look', 'act', ""'re"", 'brain-dead', 'standing', 'out', 'desert', 'sun', 'hats', 'listening', 'dully', 'yet', 'harangue', 'landowner', 'whom', 'oil-man', 'lease', 'property', 'so', 'fervently', 'religious', 'across', 'buffoon', 'capitalists', 'big', 'four', 'are', 'meant', 'know', 'are', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'more', 'realistic', 'only', 'way', 'hackneyed', 'Hollywood', 'stereotype', 'wear', 'suits', 'top', 'hats', 'smoke', 'cigars', 'harrumph', 'just', 'other', 'capitalist', 'other', 'movie', 'dawn', 'film.There', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'ludicrous', 'elements', 'film', 'plot', 'whole', 'slew', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'too', 'Just', 'how', 'spouting', 'burning', 'oil', 'oil', 'well', 'contained', 'managed', 'anyway', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'Where', 'are', 'houses', 'town', 'townspeople', 'live', 'couple', 'oil', 'wells', 'church', 'desert', 'nothing', 'else', 'shown', 'Just', 'what', 'did', 'minister', 'do', 'caused', 'be', 'so', 'desperate', 'money', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'horrible', 'react', 'so', 'outrageously', 'What', 'women', 'did', 'oil-man', 'lust', 'was', 'accused', 'minister', 'movie', 'never', 'even', 'hints', 'barely', 'women', 'film', 'why', 'everybody', 'slap', 'other', 'so', 'much', 'Good', 'lord', 'nobody', 'be', 'able', 'simply', 'walk', 'say', 'hello', 'someone', 'giving', 'belt', 'chops', 'What', 'people', 'more', 'important', 'question', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'mediocrity', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'award', 'Nothing', 'real', 'nothing', 'provocative', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'sentient', 'human', 'being', 'life', 'experience', 'Instead', 'cartoon', 'mish-mash', 'political', 'correctness', 'historical', 'revisionism', 'submitted', 'one', 'who', 'spent', 'life', 'dark', 'room', 'held', 'spellbound', 'reel', 'reel', 'celluloid']",There Will Be Blood

I will explain what the movie is about because if you haven't seen it and don't know what it is about like I was originally than hopefully this review will encourage you to watch it.The film starts out with a man named Daniel Plainview mining for silver in the late 1890's, and he uses the minerals to start his own oil business. The story jumps ahead several years, so six years later he now is moderately wealthy and successfully starts an oil well, but a young father is killed in an accident and Plainview takes in his infant son that we later discover he uses to get more deals.Plainview is then introduced to a young man named Paul Sunday who tells him about his ranch in California that has oil, and Daniel sets out and discovers he could potentially make a fortune and swindles the Sunday family out of their land, but Paul's twin brother Eli is wise to Plainview's plans and infuriates Daniel. Eli himself is some sort of amateur Evangelical preacher who wants money to fund his own church.When Plainview sets up his oil field he becomes very greedy and eventually begins to push away everyone around him, and he becomes a sad individual.The ending is very intense and if you decide to see this film you won't be disappointed because there is a lot to be impressed by.-The acting from Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano is simply incredible, Day Lewis was beyond deserving of his Oscar win.-There is gorgeous cinematography in this film.-The soundtrack is very eerie and yet strangely effective.This movie is basically an actor's movie, lots of dialog and drama, so if you like those types of movies then by all means watch this film.",5,Different than anything you'll ever see.,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1883,"['watched', 'movie', 'AMC', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'start', 'finish', 'reviews', 'movie', 'got', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'will', 'say', 'much', 'different', 'movie', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'consider', 'be', 'movie', 'buff', 'will', 'explain', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'hopefully', 'review', 'will', 'encourage', 'watch', 'it.The', 'film', 'out', 'man', 'named', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'mining', 'silver', 'late', '1890', 'minerals', 'start', 'own', 'oil', 'business', 'story', 'ahead', 'several', 'years', 'so', 'six', 'years', 'later', 'now', 'moderately', 'wealthy', 'successfully', 'oil', 'well', 'young', 'father', 'killed', 'accident', 'Plainview', 'infant', 'son', 'later', 'discover', 'get', 'more', 'deals.Plainview', 'then', 'introduced', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Paul', 'Sunday', 'who', 'ranch', 'California', 'oil', 'Daniel', 'out', 'discovers', 'could', 'potentially', 'make', 'fortune', 'Sunday', 'family', 'land', 'Paul', 'twin', 'brother', 'Eli', 'wise', 'Plainview', 'plans', 'Daniel', 'Eli', 'sort', 'amateur', 'Evangelical', 'preacher', 'who', 'money', 'fund', 'own', 'church.When', 'Plainview', 'up', 'oil', 'field', 'very', 'greedy', 'eventually', 'push', 'away', 'everyone', 'sad', 'individual.The', 'ending', 'very', 'intense', 'decide', 'see', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'lot', 'be', 'impressed', 'by.-The', 'acting', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'simply', 'incredible', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'was', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'win.-There', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'film.-The', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'eerie', 'yet', 'strangely', 'effective.This', 'movie', 'basically', 'actor', 'movie', 'lots', 'dialog', 'drama', 'so', 'like', 'types', 'movies', 'then', 'means', 'watch', 'film']",There Will Be Blood

It's a story that could have been told more effectively in an 8-minute skit.  The other two-and-a-half hours are pure boredom -- right up there with most Kevin Costner films.  The movie just drones on and on and on and on ... and never makes a point you hadn't already gotten in the first few minutes -- Daniel Plainview is crazed with greed.  About every 20 minutes you'll find yourself shouting at your TV, ""Okay, I get it.  He's nuts!  Tell me something new!""  But it never comes.I bought the movie as a Christmas gift for one of my kids, but got stuck with it when he received a duplicate.  He usually has good taste in movies, so I decided to keep it for myself.  Just another in a lifetime of bad decisions!So why did I give it 2 stars?

1124470,A11MLCDN9TR0PB,B00104QSOM,Philip W. Henry,"[2, 2]","There Will Be BloodThere Will be BloodPaul Thomas Anderson's 2007 classic ""There Will be Blood"" is a searing portrayal of ambition, greed, and betrayal set in Southern California in the early 20th century. It is the story of  Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), a silver miner-turned oil wildcatter and his climb from poverty to great wealth.  Along the way it examines the cult of evangelism, the strength of family relationships, and the emotional toll exacted by gaining success at any price.Thematically, the movie is loosely based on Upton Sinclair'sNovel ""Oil!, which in turn is based partly on the life of Edward L. Doheny, of Teapot Dome infamy.  In the movie, Plainview's son H.W. becomes deaf when the big gusher comes in.  In real life, Doheny's son Ned was killed in a murder-suicide involving his male secretary and purported lover.  The killings took place at Greystone Mansion, the enormous house the elder Doheny built for his son.  The mansion is the setting for the final scene of the movie, which I won't divulge.The cast is uniformly excellent, especially Paul Dano as Eli Sunday who also plays his brother Paul.  Eli is an ambitious evangelist, intent on growing his church with Plainview's money, which comes from the oil from the Sunday family's ranch.One element of the movie that didn't work for me was the introduction of a drifter, who shows up one day claiming to be Plainview's half-brother.  Inconsistencies show up in his story, and in a fit of rage Plainview takes his revenge.I've purposely held off discussing Daniel Day- Lewis's performance until last.  There is no disputing the intensity of Day-Lewis's acting, but for me, it was too over-the-top.Day-Lewis is notoriously avoidant of interviews and self-explanation, so we are dependent on the performance alone to determine his character's motivation.I give the movie four and a half stars... taking off one star for the poor packaging the CD comes in.  It's a cheap piece of cardboard like you find in supermarket discount ""dollar DVD's"" and a lousy way to market a product.",4,"""I Drink your Milkshake!""",1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,2064,"['Will', 'Be', 'BloodThere', 'Will', 'be', 'BloodPaul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', '2007', 'classic', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'searing', 'portrayal', 'ambition', 'greed', 'betrayal', 'set', 'Southern', 'California', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'story', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'silver', 'miner-turned', 'oil', 'wildcatter', 'climb', 'poverty', 'great', 'wealth', 'way', 'cult', 'evangelism', 'strength', 'family', 'relationships', 'emotional', 'toll', 'exacted', 'gaining', 'success', 'price.Thematically', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'Upton', ""Sinclair'sNovel"", 'Oil', 'turn', 'based', 'partly', 'life', 'Edward', 'L.', 'Doheny', 'Teapot', 'Dome', 'infamy', 'movie', 'Plainview', 'son', 'H.W', 'becomes', 'deaf', 'when', 'big', 'gusher', 'real', 'life', 'Doheny', 'son', 'Ned', 'was', 'killed', 'murder-suicide', 'involving', 'male', 'secretary', 'purported', 'lover', 'killings', 'took', 'place', 'Greystone', 'Mansion', 'enormous', 'house', 'elder', 'Doheny', 'built', 'son', 'mansion', 'setting', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge.The', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'who', 'also', 'brother', 'Paul', 'Eli', 'ambitious', 'evangelist', 'intent', 'growing', 'church', 'Plainview', 'money', 'oil', 'Sunday', 'family', 'ranch.One', 'element', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'introduction', 'drifter', 'who', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'claiming', 'be', 'Plainview', 'half-brother', 'Inconsistencies', 'show', 'up', 'story', 'fit', 'rage', 'Plainview', 'revenge.I', ""'ve"", 'purposely', 'held', 'off', 'discussing', 'Daniel', 'Day-', 'Lewis', 'performance', 'last', 'disputing', 'intensity', 'Day-Lewis', 'acting', 'was', 'too', 'over-the-top.Day-Lewis', 'notoriously', 'avoidant', 'interviews', 'self-explanation', 'are', 'dependent', 'performance', 'alone', 'determine', 'character', 'motivation.I', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'taking', 'off', 'one', 'star', 'poor', 'packaging', 'CD', 'cheap', 'piece', 'cardboard', 'find', 'supermarket', 'discount', 'dollar', 'DVD', 'lousy', 'way', 'market', 'product']",There Will Be Blood
1124471,A2GOCUKQN4QEUZ,B00104QSOM,"Phoebus Franca ""thebuffer""","[1, 4]","There are so many amazing things about this movie that it is hard to criticize it. Just saw it in the theater: waited long after its initial release and the unceasing promotion, at least on radio. It was one of those movies that you get sick of before you see it because of all the promotion about how great it was and how great Daniel Day-Lewis was. And, they have to be disappointed that they didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture, although Lewis deservedly won for Best Actor.I would put Lewis' performance was in the same category as Robert DeNiro's Jake LaMotta. He gave every ounce of himself in this performance, just as DeNiro did. This is one of the greatest movie acting performances I've ever seen, but it is not surprising because you could say that about nearly everything Lewis has done, even as Cecil in A Room With a View. However, oddly, I could sort of see the argument that some have made that he's actually miscast in this role. Is Daniel Day-Lewis really ever believable as an tough, wild, entrepreneurial oilman? I guess if he was believable as a Mohegan, he can be believable here.Though the story is effectively told, it is a backdrop to a more fascinating father-son, brother-brother, Biblical kind of storytelling. And for that, Daniel Day-Lewis is very well cast. This is what makes this movie one for the ages, perhaps living up to the hype. The movie is kind of too self-consciously channeling John Ford, John Huston, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, etc. I love those movies and so in a way it was thrilling to watch something that aspired to that kind of ageless greatness, but there's a fine line, and this movie sometimes feels a little too aware of itself and the legacy it is trying to leave.The music score is rather good, but often it is too loud and too much of a presence. It became annoying, frankly. Perhaps that was part of the effect the movie makers were trying to achieve: trying to keep the audience at a certain level, or state of annoyance at all times. The music was extremely interesting and all, but just too much. During some scenes, you just wished it would go away.In the end, I couldn't help but think with some deft editing and ratcheting down the music to make the movie tighter, it might've been great on the scale of these other greats. The story of oil discovery in this country has not been told well enough, despite how important and telling it is to the whole history of the U.S.A. And, blending it with the story of the preacher is also great. But was there ever really a Paul? I guess I need to read the book. In the end, is it success in others that Daniel Plainview can't stand, or is it failure and weakness? Who is the real preacher or ascetic in this story? Once the preacher admits his weakness, well....Anyway, this movie should not be missed - there's my hype. But it is a few tweaks away from being truly great.",4,Great but a little self-conscious,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,2881,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'amazing', 'things', 'movie', 'hard', 'criticize', 'Just', 'saw', 'theater', 'waited', 'long', 'initial', 'release', 'unceasing', 'promotion', 'least', 'radio', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'get', 'sick', 'see', 'promotion', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'how', 'great', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'was', 'have', 'be', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Lewis', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor.I', 'would', 'put', 'Lewis', 'performance', 'was', 'same', 'category', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Jake', 'LaMotta', 'gave', 'ounce', 'performance', 'just', 'DeNiro', 'did', 'one', 'greatest', 'movie', 'acting', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'surprising', 'could', 'say', 'about', 'nearly', 'everything', 'Lewis', 'done', 'even', 'Cecil', 'A', 'Room', 'View', 'However', 'oddly', 'could', 'sort', 'see', 'argument', 'have', 'made', 'actually', 'miscast', 'role', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'really', 'ever', 'believable', 'tough', 'wild', 'entrepreneurial', 'oilman', 'guess', 'was', 'believable', 'Mohegan', 'can', 'be', 'believable', 'story', 'effectively', 'told', 'backdrop', 'more', 'fascinating', 'father-son', 'brother-brother', 'Biblical', 'kind', 'storytelling', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'what', 'movie', 'one', 'ages', 'perhaps', 'living', 'up', 'hype', 'movie', 'kind', 'too', 'self-consciously', 'channeling', 'John', 'Ford', 'John', 'Huston', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'etc', 'love', 'movies', 'so', 'way', 'was', 'thrilling', 'watch', 'something', 'aspired', 'kind', 'ageless', 'greatness', 'fine', 'line', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'aware', 'legacy', 'trying', 'leave.The', 'music', 'score', 'rather', 'good', 'often', 'too', 'loud', 'too', 'much', 'presence', 'became', 'annoying', 'frankly', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'part', 'effect', 'movie', 'makers', 'were', 'trying', 'achieve', 'trying', 'keep', 'audience', 'certain', 'level', 'state', 'annoyance', 'times', 'music', 'was', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'scenes', 'just', 'wished', 'would', 'go', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'deft', 'editing', 'ratcheting', 'down', 'music', 'make', 'movie', 'tighter', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'scale', 'other', 'greats', 'story', 'oil', 'discovery', 'country', 'not', 'been', 'told', 'well', 'enough', 'how', 'important', 'telling', 'whole', 'history', 'U.S.A.', 'blending', 'story', 'preacher', 'also', 'great', 'was', 'there', 'ever', 'really', 'Paul', 'guess', 'need', 'read', 'book', 'end', 'success', 'others', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'failure', 'weakness', 'Who', 'real', 'preacher', 'ascetic', 'story', 'preacher', 'weakness', 'well', '.Anyway', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'hype', 'few', 'tweaks', 'away', 'being', 'truly', 'great']",There Will Be Blood

The story basically follows Daniel Plainview, a harsh, rags to riches oilman who makes his fortune by drilling in the vast deserts of the early 20th century American West. Daniel is an ambitious but disturbed character and by the end of the film he appears to have completely lost his mind. The film is beautifully shot with some decent acting, but I just couldn't really get into it. It has it's moments for sure, but a weak story line and somewhat exaggerated premise ruined it for me. I'm not sure if it was just a story, or if it is trying to make some larger social point. If it's the latter, what's the point? Oil makes you crazy? Greed makes you crazy? This seems to be a bit of a stretch.I will defend Daniel Day-Lewis to the death as a tremendous actor, and he is impressively intense as usual here, but he didn't have much to work with in the way of a script.

1124474,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00104QSOM,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 4]","Daniel Day Lewis is very impressive in this film...and, for the most part, very handsome...even with oil on his face.  So, for my money, it's worth watching....once.  The script is based on a story by Upton Sinclair which was relevant and important at the time Sinclair wrote it.  Now...not so much.  I think the film could have been better if the main character, Daniel Plainview, had been given more to do than cheat and rob people.  True, the interaction with his son is interesting and that saves the film.  Also, the little bit with the blond girl, Mary, was interesting and, at that point, he seemed to be a caring man who was protecting the girl from beatings by her father.What I didn't understand from the film was how deeply he degenerated after he the son returned to him.  It seemed that things were going well for him--he had the family that he had always longed for and certainly the material success.  So why, in the last segment, in his huge mansion, was he so severely embittered?  There was nothing to explain the schism between him and his son. The final scene bordered on the bizarre...did Sinclair write that?While I'm complaining, I'll add that I've about had enough of the character of the charlatan minister.  Perhaps they abounded at the time of Sinclair, but I think this stereotype has been exploited enough.  I've met many wonderful men who were ministers, even of the holy roller type, and I personally find it offensive that they are so often portrayed in this way. This fellow, Eli, was alternately wimpy, cruel, craven and hysterical, not to mention that he was bad looking and had a terrible haircut. I never did understand what happened to Paul. (Only Robert DuVall, in The Apostle, showed the positive side of these men.)Visually the film gives you plenty to look at.  The oil well fire is spectacular.  Even though it's long, it did hold my interest, mostly because of Lewis' performance.  He is such a spectacular looking man and has such a great voice that he engages our sympathy way beyond what was realistic for such a character.I was heartened to read so many negative reviews...am happy to see that not everyone is impressed by the hype this film got.

1124480,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00104QSOM,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[1, 6]","This film is a total package art form.  It has fascinating story, all around great actors and mesmerizing music that from the start is letting us know that there could not be possible good ending to this storytelling.  We learn about Daniel Plainview, a man who is living in California searching for oil.  It is late 1800s and people are still trying to find their own riches in the new land.  Daniel is shrewd, calculated and persistent.  He wants to succeed in his endeavors more than anything.  We learn about the day of the oil man rigger who life is full of physical demands and hard work.  Job is dirty and dangerous and oil fields are not afraid to claim their victims.  As Daniel becomes successful and accumulates capital, he is eager to continue searching for new wells and dig them until there is no more oil left.  In that effort helps him his young son whose innocent looks and quiet demeanor are bait for family people eager to sell their property to another family man trying to make a living for himself and his motherless son.  This all continues well until Daniel meets his arch nemesis - a local preacher who wants to make a congregation from the local oil diggers and their families.  Over the years, these two have their own disagreements and manage to get even with each other only to prove to each other that they are really the same and as such cannot coexist.  What fascinated me is the character of Daniel - he is dark, full of hatered and contempt of people even the ones closest to him, he is a loner without ever feeling lonely who knows how to feed of other people's emotions and needs and then use them to his own advantage.  This is one of those films that everyone should have in their personal library.  Daniel Day Lewis has won Academy Award for his role of Daniel Plainview but I must say that young Paul Dano was a great supporting actor too.",5,A story of an American dream only an American can tell,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,1879,"['film', 'total', 'package', 'art', 'form', 'fascinating', 'story', 'around', 'great', 'actors', 'mesmerizing', 'music', 'start', 'letting', 'know', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'good', 'ending', 'storytelling', 'learn', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'California', 'searching', 'oil', 'late', '1800s', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'own', 'riches', 'new', 'land', 'Daniel', 'shrewd', 'calculated', 'persistent', 'succeed', 'endeavors', 'more', 'anything', 'learn', 'day', 'oil', 'man', 'rigger', 'who', 'life', 'full', 'physical', 'demands', 'hard', 'work', 'Job', 'dirty', 'dangerous', 'oil', 'fields', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'claim', 'victims', 'Daniel', 'successful', 'capital', 'eager', 'continue', 'searching', 'new', 'wells', 'dig', 'more', 'oil', 'left', 'effort', 'young', 'son', 'innocent', 'looks', 'quiet', 'demeanor', 'are', 'bait', 'family', 'people', 'eager', 'sell', 'property', 'family', 'man', 'trying', 'make', 'living', 'motherless', 'son', 'well', 'Daniel', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'local', 'preacher', 'who', 'make', 'congregation', 'local', 'oil', 'diggers', 'families', 'years', 'two', 'have', 'own', 'disagreements', 'manage', 'get', 'even', 'other', 'only', 'prove', 'other', 'are', 'really', 'same', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'coexist', 'What', 'fascinated', 'character', 'Daniel', 'dark', 'full', 'hatered', 'contempt', 'people', 'even', 'ones', 'closest', 'loner', 'ever', 'feeling', 'lonely', 'who', 'how', 'feed', 'other', 'people', 'emotions', 'needs', 'then', 'use', 'own', 'advantage', 'one', 'films', 'everyone', 'should', 'have', 'personal', 'library', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'must', 'say', 'young', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'was', 'great', 'supporting', 'actor', 'too']",There Will Be Blood
1124481,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B00104QSOM,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[1, 4]","This is an elegant, beautifully-filmed, brilliantly-scored and intensely acted cinematic experience... ...that left me completely nonplussed and apathetic by the time it finished.Daniel Day-Lewis is really the only actor in this who's either A: on-screen for enough of the movie to make an impact, and/or B: talented enough to make a great performance out of a straightforward set of dialogue. It's not that his supporting cast isn't very, very good - it is - but this film, intentionally or no, ends up as a huge Star Vehicle for Day-Lewis' finely honed thesp skills, and he is excellent as a kind of Charles Foster Kane-meets-J.R. Ewing. Actually, the megalomaniacal leanings of Daniel Plainview are so total and so well-crafted that it's astonishing that we might feel any sympathy for him at all: but thanks to Day-Lewis' skill in the role, he doesn't wind up as a boring bad guy.For which the audience should be very, very grateful: Daniel Plainview is in probably 90% of this film's frames. Although sometimes this does get a little... ...well, more on that later.The direction is superlative and the cinematography, exquisite: Paul Thomas Anderson and director of photography Robert Elswitt have done a wonderful job of visualising the maddening disquiet of Plainview's greed against a barren, unforgiving environment.And the music and sound direction are wonderful, too - this movie uses silence as a sound to great effect for the first thirty minutes or so, and the discord created between lush orchestral movements and harsh, hard-to-hear air raid sirens further the audience's connection with the unusual, unpleasant actions and circumstances of the Plainview family.So why only three stars? For me, ""There Will Be Blood"" was like eating an entire table full of chocolate cakes in one sitting: sure, they're gorgeous and appealing and made to tempt the consumer - but a whole table full is just too rich and you wind up sick and bored. The relentless intensity of ""There Will Be Blood"" doesn't allow the audience to catch its breath at all, and while the acting and production are all excellent, the monotony of the film's intense tone doesn't let us assimilate what we've seen. We're constantly assaulted with more Very Serious Acting, more Very Meaningful Imagery, more Terribly Important Cinema - and ""There Will Be Blood"", at a hefty running time of 158 minutes, asks too much of its audience in trying to stay engaged with all this high-octane one-note relentless Cinematic Wonderfulness.That said, it's still a powerful, brilliant bit of cinema: I just didn't care to see more of it after the one hundred minute mark. Somehow, for me, it's less than the sum of its parts - even if its parts are incredible.",3,"Carringtons and Ewings and Plainviews, oh my!",1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,2723,"['elegant', 'beautifully-filmed', 'brilliantly-scored', 'intensely', 'acted', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'left', 'completely', 'nonplussed', 'apathetic', 'time', 'finished.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'really', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'on-screen', 'enough', 'movie', 'make', 'impact', 'and/or', 'B', 'talented', 'enough', 'make', 'great', 'performance', 'straightforward', 'set', 'dialogue', 'not', 'supporting', 'cast', ""n't"", 'very', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'intentionally', 'up', 'huge', 'Star', 'Vehicle', 'Day-Lewis', 'finely', 'honed', 'thesp', 'skills', 'excellent', 'kind', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane-meets-J.R.', 'Ewing', 'Actually', 'megalomaniacal', 'leanings', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'are', 'so', 'total', 'so', 'well-crafted', 'astonishing', 'might', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'thanks', 'Day-Lewis', 'skill', 'role', ""n't"", 'wind', 'up', 'boring', 'bad', 'guy.For', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'grateful', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'probably', '90', '%', 'film', 'frames', 'sometimes', 'get', 'little', 'well', 'more', 'later.The', 'direction', 'superlative', 'cinematography', 'exquisite', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'director', 'photography', 'Robert', 'Elswitt', 'have', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'visualising', 'maddening', 'disquiet', 'Plainview', 'greed', 'barren', 'unforgiving', 'music', 'sound', 'direction', 'are', 'wonderful', 'too', 'movie', 'silence', 'sound', 'great', 'effect', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'discord', 'created', 'lush', 'orchestral', 'movements', 'harsh', 'hard-to-hear', 'air', 'raid', 'further', 'audience', 'connection', 'unusual', 'unpleasant', 'actions', 'circumstances', 'Plainview', 'family.So', 'why', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'was', 'eating', 'entire', 'table', 'full', 'chocolate', 'cakes', 'one', 'sitting', 'sure', ""'re"", 'gorgeous', 'appealing', 'made', 'tempt', 'consumer', 'whole', 'table', 'full', 'just', 'too', 'rich', 'wind', 'up', 'sick', 'bored', 'relentless', 'intensity', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', ""n't"", 'allow', 'audience', 'catch', 'breath', 'acting', 'production', 'are', 'excellent', 'monotony', 'film', 'intense', 'tone', ""n't"", 'let', 'assimilate', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'assaulted', 'more', 'Very', 'Serious', 'Acting', 'more', 'Very', 'Meaningful', 'Imagery', 'more', 'Terribly', 'Important', 'Cinema', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'hefty', 'running', 'time', '158', 'minutes', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'trying', 'stay', 'engaged', 'high-octane', 'one-note', 'relentless', 'Cinematic', 'Wonderfulness.That', 'said', 'still', 'powerful', 'brilliant', 'bit', 'cinema', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'see', 'more', 'one', 'hundred', 'minute', 'mark', 'Somehow', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'even', 'parts', 'are', 'incredible']",There Will Be Blood

It's been said that Daniel Day-Lewis only re-channelled his performance as Bill the Butcher (Gangs of New York), but here he's in almost every scene, and the performance is as complete as it can get; the nastiest performance to win an Oscar since Hannibal Lechter or Aileen Wuornos.  He deserved the Oscar. I longed for some information regarding Mr. Plainview's previous history, and the appearance of Kevin J. Dillon as his step-brother was a great sub-plot. It's the only time Plainview showed any concern for anyone but himself. None of it turns out good. Rehashing the plot wouldn't make sense, but this is a finely crafted film, rich in detail and excellent cinematography. I also enjoyed Paul Dano (L.I.E.; Little Miss Sunshine), who showed range of character throughout. One argument is that the 2-disc DVD is inadequate, regarding Disc 2, and that is correct.

1124483,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B00104QSOM,Richard B. Schwartz,"[3, 7]","I was very disappointed in this film, particularly after the hype.  The cinematography is very impressive; visually, the film is beautiful.  Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent, but not drop-dead exceptional.  Comparisons with his performance in Gangs of New York are apt.  The score is striking in its minimalism and insistence, but after awhile it becomes grating and annoying.  Ciaran Hinds is wasted and the other supporting performances are little more than window dressing for DD-L.  This is a virtuoso role as well as a virtuoso performance and everyone else is secondary at best.  The movie is long (2 1/2 hours+), but, surprisingly, the story is undeveloped.  There is a great temporal gap between the final, pivotal scene and those that precede it.  There is also nothing about the lead character's youth in Wisconsin.  He springs full born as an adult.  That would not normally be a problem, but the story here is one of passionate greed and lust for control that devolves into madness.  It would be nice to see that pattern and process's origins.  It is sometimes said that we come to have affection for radically-flawed or even evil characters when we get to know them intimately, since to understand is to forgive, but there are really no central characters in this film who enjoy the audience's affection.  Plainview's deaf son is a possible exception, but he does not exhibit a morality of his own until he is  utterly brutalized by his adoptive father.  Prior to that he is a blank-stare cipher who accepts his father's ways.Some did not enjoy No Country for Old Men, but it is really the diametric opposite of There Will Be Blood.  The plot is airtight; the ensemble cast is superb; the film has a major, significant point (the ravages of drugs and their impact on a society) and, for all its grimness, a sense of minimal redemption in Tommy Lee Jones's character.

1124484,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B00104QSOM,Richard Masloski,"[8, 19]","Firstly, comparisons to KANE are pale.  KANE was a muti-faceted, myriad-sided film about a multi-faceted, myriad-sided man.  Plainview is.....in ""plain view.""  He is Greed incarnate, with no redeeming qualities, no ""Rosebud"" haunting his desire to drink up all of the world's milkshakes.  That being said, Daniel Day-Lewis is the REASON to see this film.  He is - throughout his career - NEVER the same person twice.  The film's cinematography, music, other actors are all strong:  it is the story that is weak.  One note.  The story of James Dean's Jett Rink in GIANT  - while not exactly the central story of that film - is very akin to the story of Daniel Plainview....except that the character of Jett Rink, like Kane, is as deep and as rich as an oil well.  THERE WILL BE BLOOD is about surfaces, and as such it is a wonderful film - but not a deep one.  And one point that greatly annoyed me:  if Plainview's ""son"" could speak - why didn't he more often do so??? And how is it that Plainview is NEVER with a wife or any woman?  It seems he would have taken a wife at some point if only to use her to attain his ends by presenting to those he ripped off a picture of himself as a more-balanced family man.  Maybe he figured, though, that just having the kid would make him seem less a wolf in sheep's clothing. Who can say? Motives are murky in this movie.  Murky...but not Mysterious...and that is why the film comes off as one note.  A symphony with one theme.

This is moralizing plain and square, departing from the more subtle variations that are found in the book,'Oil' from which it is taken.

1124489,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00104QSOM,RMurray847,"[4, 6]","Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance of startling specificity, energy & intensity in his portrayal of oilman Daniel Plainview.  From the first moments we meet him, working as ""miner"" all by himself in a deep hole in New Mexico in 1898, we know this man is driven to bring wealth out of the depths of the earth.  From those early, lonely days digging for silver ore, to his early days prospecting for oil...he is a force of nature himself.  He doesn't seem interested in wealth, per se...but in the successful fulfillment of an almost uncontrollable desire to make his mark in his chosen profession.  Even when success would allow him to hire others, he still eagerly gets into the much of a new dig himself.  He MUST do what he can to personally wring from the hard earth the hidden treasures it is hiding from him.  It's almost a personal battle against the earth (and any competitors).Eventually, we hear and see Plainview selling poor farmers on the idea of him allowing them to drill on their land, and we begin to suspect that not only will he do anything he physically can to achieve his goals...but he may be happy to deceive anyone he needs to.  He talks a good game, and he seems to back it up with results...but he's too driven to keep the promises he's made.Plainview ends up in California's desert, where he is convinced he's about to strike it big.  He also meet s up with dough-faced Eli Sunday (Paul Dano)...a charismatic healer & preacher whom Plainview must cajole into allowing him to drill on and near his land.  We see that Plainview has a deep dislike for religion (a feeling that is never explained) and that he has no intention of fulfilling his promises to Eli.This is just the 45 minutes or so of the film...because it is of epic scope and length.  And Day-Lewis is in almost every scene.  Here is an actor of such power and commitment that he literally rivets our attention at all times we see him.  In fact, if director Paul Thomas Anderson really wants us to pay attention to other characters, he must focus his camera directly on that other actor and not include Day-Lewis in the shot.  It's an old-fashioned performance in many ways because there is nothing subtle or down-played.  Day-Lewis knows how to make larger-than-life work better than any actor working today.  He's capable of playing a more modest man quite well (see THE CRUCIBLE or THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE)...but here he's set free to scorch every frame he's in.  It makes his performance as Bill The Butcher in GANGS OF NEW YORK seem positively underplayed.  Yet he never teeters into camp or scenery chewing.  His Plainview is a many driven by demons we can only mostly guess at...but it's clear that Day-Lewis has decided exactly what those demons are and he goes full tilt.The only thing that seems to matter in Plainview's life is his ""son"" HW...who is actually the orphan of a former worker whom Plainview has been raising since infancy.  We think that Plainview may be exploiting the boy...but for most of the film, we see that the only love Plainview has to give is towards this child, and we do not doubt that they actually have a loving relationship...certainly he is a better father than most men in 1910 would have been.But one day, HW is injured and Plainview is unable to cope with the consequences of the injury.  He blames the young boy on some level, but he clearly blames the minister who says the blame is all Plainview's because he did not let Reverend Sunday bless the new well.  Thus begins a lifelong animosity between the two...and Plainview's somewhat inexplicable descent into madness.The film is fascinating.  Aside from Day-Lewis, Paul Dano also gives an excellent performance as the pious reverend who may NOT be quite as saintly as he appears.  The scenery is beautiful and the specificity of the work of running an early oil field is wonderfully presented.  It feels wholly authentic.Yet with all that brilliant work on display, I could not latch onto this film.  Not for one minute is it boring or less than fascinating.  Yet, with its abrupt final act and even more abrupt ending...I was left wondering what the heck all that hard work by Paul Thomas Anderson (the writer director of this...as well as BOOGIE NIGHTS and MAGNOLIA) and Daniel Day-Lewis was for.  As a story, it lacked a logical conclusion to its arc.  When the climactic confrontation comes...we are barely aware it is upon us until it's over.  And after spending all that time with Plainview...we just crave something more...a conclusion to the STORY.So I was left with the conclusion that truly what Plainview was is a representation of capitalism.  A mad and maddening symbol of everything WRONG with business and greed.  And Eli Sunday is merely a symbol of the weakness and hypocrisy of religion.  So Anderson is condemning both the capitalism that has made this country great AND the religion that has given us much of our core values.  And HW may be the symbol for family...and if so, that goes quite sour as well.So, I either spent 2 and a half hours watching an interesting story and character study that ends with a whimper...or 2 and a half hours watching a fascinatingly detailed screed against capitalism and religion.  Either way, I was tremendously disappointed...and frankly a little angry or perplexed at Anderson.  Even now, after a day to reflect on my experience of seeing THERE WILL BE BLOOD, I can't quite wrap my mind around any conclusion.And before you accuse me of simply hating open ended, non-conclusive movies...I had no problems with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN or EASTERN PROMISES...both brilliant films that didn't wrap things up in a tidy package.  I could ascribe meaning to those films, and I felt the stories were told to a point where I didn't mind walking away from them.  I wanted to yell at THERE WILL BE BLOOD...to demand of it ""There Will Be a Meaning!!!""  But I'm afraid I missed it...and I'll be a lot of others will too.Clearly the film has drawn huge praise from critics.  And there is MUCH to praise...don't get me wrong.  Seeing Daniel Day-Lewis at his very best is an experience not to be missed.  But I suspect that many of those same critics would be hard pressed to say, ""This film meant...""  I think everyone should see it...but I also doubt it will remain a classic.--Visit my site [...] for more reviews",4,There will be frustration...and an Oscar for Daniel Day-Lewis,1200700800,"01 19,

From the silent work that DDL carries out in a dank mine, you get a feeling for the lack of all social structure and decency in the greedy poor.  As he works his way up, he leaves a trail of damaged people in all his achievements.  However, this work of art is no caricature.  The characters are realistic and believable, if uglier than we care to imagine much of our past to have been.DDL creates a truly unique character.  He hates and uses everyone, even the son he adopts, letting no one close, especially women.  His one unguarded moment leads inexorably  to murder.

1124493,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00104QSOM,Robert Moore,"[5, 8]","Is Daniel Day-Lewis the best actor in the world?  Given his reluctance to make many films this is a difficult question to answer.  Certainly there is no actor today of whom we expect truly extraordinary things on the rare occasions he does make a major movie.  Despite having turned in several unforgettable performances over the years of almost inconceivable range -- just contrast his effeminate fop in ROOM WITH A VIEW with his sexy Tomas in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING with his Hawkeye as ultimate action hero in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS with his wheelchair bound Christy Brown in MY LEFT FOOT (for which he justifiably won his first Oscar) with his unfairly accused political prisoner in IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (second Oscar nomination) with the brutal Bill the Butcher in THE GANGS OF NEW YORK (third Oscar nomination).  Which is the real Daniel Day-Lewis?  None of them?  All of them?  What is so intensely exciting about Day-Lewis as an actor is how completely he becomes who he is playing.  It is hard to imagine him being different than he is in the film.  He is famous for the degree to which he stays ""in character"" during the filming of a movie.  I can only imagine that it takes him several days if not weeks to come down from wherever he has to exist while performing a role.I saw THERE WILL BE BLOOD the night before the Oscars.  The Academy Awards frequently not only get things wrong, but also do so in quite stupid ways.  They have a long history of this.  Remember, neither Alfred Hitchcock nor Barbara Stanwyck ever won Oscars, nor did Ernst Lubitsch nor Cary Grant, not did . . . and the list could go on forever.  But I left the theater completely convinced that for once a performance was so astonishing that not even the often absurd Oscars could get this one wrong.  Nor did they.  In fact, if you could do a winners competition among the Oscar winners, Day-Lewis might beat out all the other winners this decade for a sort of Super Oscar.  I don't remember the last time I saw a performance this amazing.Unfortunately, I'm not convinced the rest of the movie is as good as Day-Lewis.  I give it five stars, but I wonder if it is the masterpiece many are proclaiming it.  I'll share my doubts later in the review.  There were many things I loved in the film.  I don't remember the last time I loved an incidental sound track like I did this one (though of course, a film like ONCE, where the music was central to the whole film, is a completely different matter -- one of the other things I loved at this year's Oscars was Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova winning an Oscar of their own).  The music was sometimes lyrical, but more often it was atmospheric, generating an almost visceral reaction.  ONCE aside, this may have been the movie from 2007 whose music I most enjoyed.And visually this was a delight.  Shot after shot was a complete delight.  Even today, several days after having seen the movie, a host of brilliant images come to mind.  The bare, sparse, almost ascetic sets were haunting.  I especially love the beginning of the film.  It must have been at least 15 to 20 minutes into the film before the first word was spoken.  Yet during that time we learn so much about Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) and the world he inhabits.  It is brutal, demanding, and dangerous work.Obviously Paul Thomas Anderson means the film in a topical way.  I actually read many, many years ago Upton Sinclair's OIL, the book upon which this film was loosely based.  Sinclair was, of course, an ardent socialist, a position I'm not at all out of sympathy with.  Like Sinclair and, apparently, Anderson, I agree that capitalism is a very dangerous, extraordinarily unproductive economic system.  Well, it is productive for those at the top, but not for most of the people within that economy.  But my complaints are far more specific, with the delusions of the free marketers (if the free marketers ever bothered to actually read Adam Smith they would discover that he is not a free marketer, since he believed that there should be many moral limits placed on economic enterprise -- in other words, Smith felt that government might need to intervene in an economy, something the most ardent free marketers would deny).  Now I go into this in a tiny bit of detail to contrast it with what THERE WILL BE BLOOD says about capitalism, which is:  capitalism is bad.  There is no subtlety in the depiction of Plainview as a capitalist.  We see that in the end it leaves neither the exploiter nor the exploited happy, but is that because there is something messed up on the system?  Or is it simply because Plainview is a sociopath?Anderson strikes out against the second great blight on American life today.  If free market utopians have destroyed the economic well being of most Americans by their promises that if we just stick with the market, all will benefit (embodied in various trickle down theories -- but as one of Plainview's contemporaries, Will Rogers, liked to explain, gold isn't, like many assume, like water.  If you put it at the top of a pile, it doesn't trickle down to everything below.  Nope, Gold is like Gold.  Put it at the top and it just stays there).  But the second blight on American life is clearly a politicized fundamentalist Christianity.  If Anderson aims one barrel of his shotgun at capitalist exploiters, the other is at false religious leaders.  The two forces clash for the length of the film, until literally coming to blows at the end.  But again, apart from just throwing Eli's hypocritical preacher out there as a symbol of the emptiness of religion gone bad, nothing is either said or even hinted at on a deeper level.  We all know that there are charlatan preachers.  We know there are religious demagogues like James Dobson and Pat Robertson.  Just as Plainview says nothing about capitalism in general, so Eli says nothing about religion in general.  They are paraded out as symbols, but their symbolism is never truly investigated.Nonetheless, if this is not a deep film, it is on the surface of things a brilliant one.  There are so many great moments.  The scene in which Plainview converts to Christianity in order to get the rights to take his pipeline across the property of one old crank is as unforgettable as any scene you'll ever encounter.By the way, the line from the film that is quickly becoming one of the most famous from any recent film - ""I drink your milkshake"" - comes, according to an interview I heard with Paul Thomas Anderson, from testimony that Senator Albert Fall gave during the Teapot Dome Scandal.  Fall was explaining about ""drainage,"" drilling at an angle to take oil that is below the surface of someone else's land.  (Not that I'm trying to justify Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but what precipitated that invasion was precisely Kuwait's stealing Iraq's oil by drilling at a sharp angle at their border into Iraqi oil reserves.  Iraq actually had a legitimate complaint against Kuwait, though I'm sure no one believes that this justified their invading the smaller country.)  Anderson claimed - I have not independently verified this - that Fall used the same image as that in the film.  Namely, ""If you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake, and my straw reaches all across the room, then I drink your milkshake.""  Though Anderson also admits he embellished the line a bit.  No question that Daniel Day-Lewis sold the line.But in the end, there is one main reason for seeing this film:  Daniel Day-Lewis.  Before I saw this I would have put him on the shortest of short lists of the great actors of his age.  Now I truly think he stands alone.",4,A film made transcendent by utterly brilliant lead performance,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,7644,"['Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'best', 'actor', 'world', 'Given',

Scenes begin.  And then they end, with little in the way of connecting threads to give you a sense of place or sense of building tension.  You are given the facts that Daniel Plainview is an oil man, he's raising his son to be an oil man, and he gets on the wrong side of a crazy young preacher (Paul Dano doing his creepy/crazy thing again).  Countdown to violence, set your clock for 2 hours.  That's about it.  There are no outstandingly memorable lines of dialog or scenes of bonding between characters.  There's no jokes.  No lightness.  Everything is just tense and still.  Lots of squinting, people staring off camera, muttering about oil or food or whatever.The only real tension in the film comes when an oil well is being dug because accidents happen and people die, badly.  That I liked.  The sense of danger of being down in the well?  Yeah, they got that.  Those scenes were visceral and on-target.The period detail is good, too.  But it's buried in this dry rambling narrative.  It would be interesting if it was downward spiral, but you never know who Daniel Plainview is from the get-go, he's a blank slate who just drills oil.  The film doesn't even get a pass for being a character study because it never shows you who he is aside from him being a guy who drills oil.I enjoyed Magnolia for what it was.. that film had a lot of sad beauty in it and spoke to the human condition in a meaningful, if troubled, way.  I respect PT Anderson for the effort on that one.

1124497,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00104QSOM,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 3]","""There Will Be Blood"" - Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, ""Oil"" - runs for a good fifteen minutes before a single word is ever spoken.  Yet, that prolonged reticence is probably the least peculiar aspect of a movie that becomes progressively more bizarre the longer it goes on.In the role that won him an Oscar, Daniel Day-Lewis - who, with his stentorian tones, sounds as if he's channeling John Huston for large portions of the film - plays Daniel Plainview, an ambitious oil man in turn-of-the-century California who, in his ruthless quest for money and success, finds he has no room left over in his heart for either God or his fellow man.  Plainview's main antagonist is Eli Sunday, a fire-and-brimstone faith-healer who turns out to be every bit as opportunistic and empty-souled as the godless Plainview (and considerably more hypocritical).With two such unsavory and unsympathetic lead characters, Anderson really didn't have much choice but to go for the abstract in his approach, turning Sinclair's tale into an exercise in art house style that is as liable to alienate ""general audience"" viewers as pull them in.  Anderson is dealing with some mighty resonant themes here - greed, deception, abandonment, religion, filial relationships, Man's place in the universe - and he brings an appropriately ""grand opera"" sensibility to the film.  He lets Day-Lewis swing for the fences in his performance, resulting in a mesmerizing admixture of over-the-top histrionics and soul-searing subtlety.  Anderson has mounted the film in such a way as to make the visuals and the landscape as integral to the storyline as the characters - at times even more so, as the script frequently fails to sufficiently clarify the motives for why the characters do what they do.  Their actions often feel so arbitrary and inexplicable that we begin to wonder if crucial portions of the film might not have actually ended up on the cutting-room floor.  This is particularly the case in the later stretches of the movie as Plainview descends ever more into paranoia and madness.Paul Dano (""Little Miss Sunshine"") and Dillon Freasier are both excellent as the callow preacher and Plainview's young son, H.W., respectively; and Robert Elswit's award-winning cinematography evokes the beauty of the setting without ever downplaying its bleakness.  Finally, Jonny Greenwood's haunting score nicely underlines the purple-prose nature of the piece.Alternately visionary and pretentious, ""There Will Be Blood"" may not be for all tastes and audience demographics, but its uniqueness, daring and style remind us of why many of us enjoy going to the movies in the first place.",4,audacious but uneven film,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,2692,"['Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'ambitious', 'adaptation', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', '1927', 'novel', 'Oil', 'good', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'single', 'word', 'ever', 'spoken', 'prolonged', 'reticence', 'probably', 'least', 'peculiar', 'aspect', 'movie', 'progressively', 'more', 'bizarre', 'longer', 'role', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'who', 'stentorian', 'tones', 'channeling', 'John', 'Huston', 'large', 'portions', 'film', 'plays', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'ambitious', 'oil', 'man', 'turn-of-the-century', 'California', 'who', 'ruthless', 'quest', 'money', 'success', 'room', 'left', 'over', 'heart', 'God', 'fellow', 'man', 'Plainview', 'main', 'antagonist', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'fire-and-brimstone', 'faith-healer', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'opportunistic', 'empty-souled', 'godless', 'Plainview', 'considerably', 'more', 'hypocritical', '.With', 'two', 'such', 'unsavory', 'unsympathetic', 'lead', 'characters', 'Anderson', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'choice', 'go', 'abstract', 'approach', 'turning', 'Sinclair', 'tale', 'exercise', 'art', 'house', 'style', 'as', 'liable', 'alienate', 'general', 'audience', 'viewers', 'pull', 'Anderson', 'dealing', 'mighty', 'resonant', 'themes', 'here', 'greed', 'deception', 'abandonment', 'religion', 'filial', 'relationships', 'Man', 'place', 'universe', 'appropriately', 'grand', 'opera', 'sensibility', 'film', 'Day-Lewis', 'swing', 'fences', 'performance', 'resulting', 'mesmerizing', 'admixture', 'over-the-top', 'histrionics', 'soul-searing', 'subtlety', 'Anderson', 'mounted', 'film', 'way', 'make', 'visuals', 'landscape', 'integral', 'storyline', 'characters', 'times', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'script', 'frequently', 'sufficiently', 'clarify', 'motives', 'why', 'characters', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'Their', 'actions', 'often', 'feel', 'so', 'arbitrary', 'inexplicable', 'begin', 'wonder', 'crucial', 'portions', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting-room', 'floor', 'particularly', 'case', 'later', 'stretches', 'movie', 'Plainview', 'ever', 'more', 'paranoia', 'madness.Paul', 'Dano', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Dillon', 'Freasier', 'are', 'excellent', 'callow', 'preacher', 'Plainview', 'young', 'son', 'H.W.', 'respectively', 'Robert', 'Elswit', 'award-winning', 'cinematography', 'beauty', 'setting', 'ever', 'downplaying', 'bleakness', 'Finally', 'Jonny', 'Greenwood', 'haunting', 'score', 'nicely', 'purple-prose', 'nature', 'piece.Alternately', 'visionary', 'pretentious', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'tastes', 'audience', 'demographics', 'uniqueness', 'daring', 'style', 'remind', 'why', 'many', 'enjoy', 'going', 'movies', 'first', 'place']",There Will Be Blood

Schultz,"[1, 3]","For a while, I thought the arc of this movie was going to parallel the classic ""Citizen Kane"" trajectory, with Daniel Day-Lewis' character rising from humble beginnings and snatched opportunities as an oil well rigger - to a hollow, rattling, rambling millionaire alone amidst his riches. However, just as I thought I had the character's conclusion pegged that way, the movie made another catapult into new territory.Everything about this movie proceeds by jagged, akimbo grasshopper leaps, like the ones that might be made by the giant grasshopper-like well pumps that dominate the film's landscapes. ""Blood"" has a distinctive beat to its plot - just as its score has a distinctive beat marked by industrial clanks and crunches.The plot is loosely based on Upton Sinclair's book, ""Oil,"" exposing the greed and chicanery rampant in the oil mining industry. However where Sinclair's book made the protagonist's adversaries a consortium of industrialists - this movie made Lewis' main adversaries a group of religious fundamentalists. That was a daring choice, but it does give the action another dimension.Paul Dano is superb as the two-faced religious leader - so smooth and passively faith-basted on the one hand - so much the raging tyrant on the other.

1124501,A6FIAB28IS79,B00104QSOM,Samuel Chell,"[2, 4]","The acting, the settings, the cinematography, the uncompromising editing (rejecting the familiar shot/reverse shot relay in favor of long takes), the spectacular scene of a fiery oil strike (recalling the air strike in ""Apocalypse Now""), the nuanced richness of the film score, the tour-de-force performance of Day-Lewis (perhaps only Orson Welles' Kane compares) require that anyone who is the least bit serious about film make this experience a top priority.  But the end of this disturbing spectacle doesn't produce the catharsis of either a ""Citizen Kane"" (whose protagonist has at least an intimation of the truth, i.e. Rosebud) or an ""Oedipus Rex"" (whose protagonist not only eventually acquires self-knowledge but acts on it), and for that reason I'm withholding a star.But there's yet another reason to have some reservations.  Films that are ultimately the most powerful and enduring are those that put the verisimilitude of ""everyday life"" first and foremost, leaving the deeper allegorical implications to those who choose to pursue them.  At the half-way point, ""There Will Be Blood"" takes a surrealistic turn, and more than likely many spectators who have begun this lengthy film (with Lewis dominating every shot and scene save one) will tune out.  It's even more likely that most casual spectators will, at the end of this seemingly out-of-control scenario, simply breathe a sigh of relief that it's over and dismiss the whole business as wild and wacky, crazy stuff.Still, this is a viewing experience that can only strengthen its grip on reflective spectators.  Now that I've seen the film, it's become rooted in consciousness much like a Faulkner novel, in which a single character (named Compson or Sutpen) comes to represent an entire culture, from its idealistic, heroic and noble beginnings to its delusional and narcissistic, pathetic and decadent end (Faulkner's thunderous ""Absalom! Absalom!"" is the modern prototype).  You will see no blood in this film.  That would require a character capable of forgiving and being forgiven, of loving and being loved, of being not merely the sole god of his universe (who abandons his son, after denying that he's even begotten him) but the lamb, willing to sacrifice himself for others and able to function as a member of a human family whose bonds are not merely the artificial ones based on greed, radical individualism, and unrelenting competitiveness.  Instead, we are left with the certainty that the ambition and arrogance we have witnessed can only beget more needless destruction of human life.  In that sense, there indeed will be blood.Yes, the movie is especially relevant to our present political-economic situation (toward the end of the film a character makes reference to a bad ""economy""--and the year is 1927, 2 years before 1929--or, if you prefer, 2009).  But it hits even deeper and closer to home than the culture surrounding us.  It doesn't require a lot of soul-searching to see the protagonist as a symbol, or magnified reflection, of one's own selfish journey in life.  The discovery is more than a little disturbing, exposing the wounds of ethnic pride, family insularity and, above all, the constant denial and prideful isolation practiced by the willful self.  Nonetheless, the film ultimately falls short of the balance between ""pity and fear"" that Aristotle required of great tragedy.  Daniel Day-Lewis's character is obviously fatally flawed if not hubris personified  (also part of the Aristotelian definition), and that's a pity of immense proportions--but no more.[Later: This is a film that continues to play itself out long after the final scene. It's occurred to me that there is, after all, a hint of redemptive blood-- not in the protagonist but his son.  The early shots of the child as a baby are sufficient proof to this viewer that Daniel Plainview is (despite his final disclaimer that he adopted the child merely as a sales gimmick) the boy's father.  The spectator's ""reward,"" or epiphany, occurs when, for a fractional moment at the end, we see the ""deaf-mute"" son respond to his father's voice.  That moment tells us that the son has deliberately chosen an indirect, defensive route of communicating with a non-communicative father, wisely (as it turns out) hedging his bets should the father prove adamant and unyielding in his bloodless inhumanity.  The son, not the father, has seen to the completion of the ""Abraham-Isaac"" story, an archetypal drama that offers hope for a future in which  the son, rather than repeat the sins of the father, acquires an identity of his own.]",4,"A must-see for those who require more than entertainment (indicting our national, ethnic, personal hubris)",1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,4590,"['acting', 'settings', 'cinematography', 'uncompromising', 'editing', 'rejecting', 'familiar', 'shot/reverse', 'shot', 'relay', 'favor', 'long', 'spectacular', 'scene', 'fiery', 'oil', 'strike', 'recalling', 'air', 'strike', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'nuanced', 'richness', 'film', 'score', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Day-Lewis', 'perhaps', 'only', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Kane', 'compares', 'require', 'anyone', 'who', 'least', 'bit', 'serious', 'film', 'make', 'experience', 'top', 'priority', 'end', 'disturbing', 'spectacle', ""n't"", 'produce', 'catharsis', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'protagonist', 'least', 'intimation', 'truth', 'i.e', 'Rosebud', 'Oedipus', 'Rex', 'protagonist', 'not', 'only', 'eventually', 'self-knowledge', 'reason', ""'m"", 'withholding', 'star.But', 'yet', 'reason', 'have', 'reservations', 'Films', 'are', 'ultimately', 'most', 'powerful', 'enduring', 'are', 'put', 'verisimilitude', 'everyday', 'life', 'first', 'foremost', 'leaving', 'deeper', 'allegorical', 'implications', 'who', 'choose', 'pursue', 'half-way', 'point', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'surrealistic', 'turn', 'more', 'likely', 'many', 'spectators', 'who', 'have', 'begun', 'lengthy', 'film', 'Lewis', 'dominating', 'shot', 'scene', 'save', 'one', 'will', 'tune', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'likely', 'most', 'casual', 'spectators', 'will', 'end', 'seemingly', 'out-of-control', 'scenario', 'simply', 'breathe', 'sigh', 'relief', 'dismiss', 'whole', 'business', 'wild', 'wacky', 'crazy', 'stuff.Still', 'viewing', 'experience', 'can', 'only', 'strengthen', 'grip', 'reflective', 'spectators', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'become', 'rooted', 'consciousness', 'much', 'Faulkner', 'novel', 'single', 'character', 'named', 'Compson', 'Sutpen', 'represent', 'entire', 'culture', 'idealistic', 'heroic', 'noble', 'beginnings', 'delusional', 'narcissistic', 'pathetic', 'decadent', 'end', 'Faulkner', 'thunderous', 'Absalom', 'Absalom', 'modern', 'prototype', 'will', 'see', 'blood', 'film', 'would', 'require', 'character', 'capable', 'forgiving', 'being', 'forgiven', 'loving', 'being', 'loved', 'being', 'not', 'merely', 'sole', 'god', 'universe', 'who', 'son', 'denying', 'even', 'begotten', 'lamb', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'others', 'able', 'function', 'member', 'human', 'family', 'bonds', 'are', 'not', 'merely', 'artificial', 'ones', 'based', 'greed', 'radical', 'individualism', 'unrelenting', 'competitiveness', 'Instead', 'are', 'left', 'certainty', 'ambition', 'arrogance', 'have', 'witnessed', 'can', 'only', 'beget', 'more', 'needless', 'destruction', 'human', 'life', 'sense', 'indeed', 'will', 'be', 'blood.Yes', 'movie', 'especially', 'relevant', 'present', 'political-economic', 'situation', 'end', 'film', 'character', 'reference', 'bad', 'economy', 'year', '1927', '2', 'years', '1929', 'prefer', '2009', 'even', 'deeper', 'closer', 'home', 'culture', 'surrounding', ""n't"", 'require', 'lot', 'soul-searching', 'see', 'protagonist', 'symbol', 'magnified', 'reflection', 'one', 'own', 'selfish', 'journey', 'life', 'discovery', 'more', 'little', 'disturbing', 'exposing', 'wounds', 'ethnic', 'pride', 'family', 'insularity', 'constant', 'denial', 'prideful', 'isolation', 'practiced', 'willful', 'self', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'ultimately', 'short', 'balance', 'pity', 'fear', 'Aristotle', 'required', 'great', 'tragedy', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'character', 'obviously', 'fatally', 'flawed', 'not', 'hubris', 'personified', 'also', 'part', 'Aristotelian', 'definition', 'pity', 'immense', 'proportions', 'more', '[', 'Later', 'film', 'play', 'out', 'long', 'final', 'scene', 'occurred', 'hint', 'redemptive', 'blood', 'not', 'protagonist', 'son', 'early', 'shots', 'child', 'baby', 'are', 'sufficient', 'proof', 'viewer', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'final', 'disclaimer', 'adopted', 'child', 'merely', 'sales', 'gimmick', 'boy', 'father', 'spectator', 'reward', 'epiphany', 'when', 'fractional', 'moment', 'end', 'see', 'deaf-mute', 'son', 'respond', 'father', 'voice', 'moment', 'son', 'deliberately', 'chosen', 'indirect', 'defensive', 'route', 'communicating', 'non-communicative', 'father', 'wisely', 'out', 'hedging', 'bets', 'should', 'father', 'prove', 'adamant', 'unyielding', 'bloodless', 'inhumanity', 'son', 'not', 'father', 'seen', 'completion', 'Abraham-Isaac', 'story', 'archetypal', 'drama', 'hope', 'future', 'son', 'rather', 'repeat', 'sins', 'father', 'identity', 'own', ']']",There Will Be Blood

Hollywood almost fetishizes the need for a complete, emotionally uplifting ending, while some of the best products that come out of it (""Seven,"" ""Resevoir Dogs"") have very UNHAPPY endings.  ""There Will Be Blood"" is that type of movie.  It's beautiful to look at, stunningly acted, luxuriously filmed, and brilliantly directed, yet some folks were upset there was no salvation for Daniel Day Lewis' conniving oilman.  Lewis' Daniel Plainview isn't the type who is looking for salvation in the sense we see it anyway.  He's willing to go and be baptized, but it's for the alternate worldly purpose to get access to a tract for its oil.The beauty of the movie is in the details.  Day Lewis and Paul Dano play men each in the grips of an obsessive worldview.  For Daniel Plainview, it's the persuit of oil and wealth.  For the man who will be his nemesis, Dana's teen apocalyptic preacher Eli Sunday, it's the salvation of souls.  Each man is ultimately destroyed by their obsessions, but Paul Anderson doesn't hit us over the head with the message.  He is as brilliant letting the actors develop their own take on the characters' doom as he is in the choice of shots which shows modern-day filmgoers the true beauty and bleakness of the west at the turn of the 20th century.Day Lewis is justifyably praised for his portrayal of the ruthless oilman, with all the delicate soul-searching and dare I say tenderness of the man, mixed in with his calculated huckster's bombasity.  What is often overlooked is Dano's softspoken approach with the ultimately hypocritical Eli.  Dano portrays him as, at first, quietly intense and earnest, if a little consumed by his evangelical zeal.  However, without hammering out what is to become of him, Dano shows us the similarities between Eli and Daniel, including the outrageous ""driving out of the Devil"" he trots out at his church.  We expect, and yet are sadly shocked, by Eli's unravelling at the end.  We see it coming, and yet are taken aback at its rapaidity.  Paul Dano certainly deserves some of the credit for carrying ""Blood.""If there's one disappointment in the film itself, it IS the abruptness of the destruction of these two men.  The film's deliberate pace makes us feel there should have been more.  Instead, we see an explosion of rage and violence, with a denuemont that's too quickly over, leaving us in the audience to say, ""Wha.....?""  A disappointment Anderson and his filmwriter couldn't have been as deliberate with the ending as they were with the rest of the movie.Still, as I read in another review, home video will make watching ""Blood"" repeatedly necessary and enjoyable.

I'm not sure when I'll want to watch it again - it may be years - but eventually I will dive back in to this stark portrayal of one man's drive for the American Dream.Daniel Day Lewis plays Daniel Plainview and gives one of his trademark pitch-perfect, scary performances.  Plainview is essentially an ogre, desperate to sate his own appetites and more than willing to crush any mere human who crosses his path.Indeed, we first see Plainview hacking out a living in a silver mine, living in solitary desolation almost like a fabled monster in a cave.  Plainview's the kind of guy who considers a shattered leg worthy of a grunt or two, but not a real impediment to success - we see this in some brutal early scenes.But eventually Plainview becomes an oilman, willing to risk it all to find Wealth in the ground.  And why?  So he can get enough money so he can avoid human contact of any kind, a la Howard Hughes.This is a strange, powerful film.  A harsh soundtrack, a bleak landscape, and a cast filled with strong men playing for keeps in an unforgiving world combine to make this a chilling, riveting masterpiece. ""I drink your milkshake!"" is destined to go down as one of the great catch-phrases of cinema, perhaps the ultimate bit of trash-talk.Look for powerful performances throughout the film, although to be fair women don't get much chance to shine here.  Lewis is stellar, as always, but Paul Dano (""Little Miss Sunshine"") really surprises as the twin boys Paul and Eli Sunday - the latter gets one of the most bizarre and horrifying story arcs in recent memory.

1124506,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B00104QSOM,Scrimshaw,"[0, 0]","Out of all of P.T. Anderson's films There will be Blood is without a doubt my favorite, and it seems that many would agree with me, as it's main character/villain Daniel Plainview is now a very iconic character in American cinema. Out of all of Anderson's film, There will be Blood is definitely the closest that comes to being a horror film, as much of the music and atmosphere of this film is reminiscent of creepy, disturbing films from the 70's such as El Topo and Picnic at Hanging Rock. Of course it's not nearly as ""out there"" as the aforementioned films but it definitely has a similar vibe. It essentially follows a gold miner who strikes it rich after discovering oil in the bleak deserts of turn of the century California. Even the ominous title, There will Be Blood, sounds like the title of a horror movie as opposed to a historical drama. Jigsaw anyone? Anyway, in addition to that, and last but certainly not least, the creepy musical score combined with the menacing atmosphere also adds to the ""horror"" vibe of the film. Don't be misled though, There will Be Blood is dark, but it is no horror movie, it's a character study of a man who becomes rich and successful, essentially achieving the American dream, but at the cost of his soul and humanity. If there was ever a film that exemplified the saying Money doesn't buy happiness, this would be it folks. Plainview, played with a commanding force and presence by the amazing Daniel Day-Lewis, is matched against the ambitious son of a local preacher named Eli Sunday, played by the talented and underrated young actor Paul Dano, who also plays Eli's twin brother Paul. Rounding out the main cast is his ""son"" and business partner H.W. Plainview, who is actually the orphaned son of one of Daniel's workers who was killed in a work-related accident. The 3 hour film follows Plainview's descent into darkness, going from an ""oilman"" to a ruthless competitor and murderer. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're in the mood for a brilliant and fascinating film that takes a dark and cynical look into the ""American dream"", be sure to watch this.

1124508,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B00104QSOM,Sean Curley,"[1, 3]","Director Paul Thomas Anderson does another period piece, skipping further back in time then he did with his famous 1997 work ""Boogie Nights"".  This time, the destination is the United States in the early years of the 20th century, with a brief epilogue set some time after the Wall Street crash of 1929.  The subject is the California oil industry, based (very, very loosely) on Upton Sinclair's famous book ""Oil!"".  The character is Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis in his second Oscar-winning role.The story follows Plainview as he pursues his dream of earning enough money to separate himself forever from other people, who he despises as a general rule.  He has a son, H.W., who he actually does care for, though at the same time he loves money; one is reminded of one analysis of Shylock that said that the most charitable thing to be said about his attitudes was that if he didn't put his daughter before his ducats, at least the reverse wasn't true.  Plainview is given a hot tip by Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) about huge amounts of oil in his home town, and hurries to buy up all the neighbouring areas.  The major other character is Eli Sunday (also Dano), a would-be evangelical preacher and miracle-worker.  If Plainview is brutal capitalism, Sunday is fundamentalist religion (recalling the huckster faith-healers of later decades).  As business grows, the conflict between the two grows based on minor acts of spite and conflicting worldviews.The character of Plainview is the movie, basically.  As played by Day-Lewis, in a volcanic performance, he is a mass of contradictions and impulses: he genuinely cares for his son, but at the same time he is driven by greed for money.  When his son becomes deafened in an accident, Plainview first cannot stay beside him because of the accident, and later, struggling to deal with it, sends him away to the city.  In what I think Plainview regards as Sunday's most offensive act, he forces him to face up to this action and show genuine weakness and desperation to escape the possible wrath of God.  Plainview later reenacts this scene at the climax, with the roles reversed, to remarkable effect.  Occasionally, he explodes into violence, particularly when family is brought up; as he relates to one character who later falls victim to this violence, he doesn't like people, and at times he seems like he does want to reach out.  Ultimately, though, he is a cynical, vengeful, black-hearted old man that Ebenezer Scrooge would be appalled by.Anderson and his crew meticulously reconstruct the time period, conveying the many dangers faced by the pioneer workers in the early oil industry.  More than one many dies a grisly death as a result, and blows sting the audience as sharply as the bolts from Anton Chigurh's airgun.On another note, this is often called an adaptation of Sinclair's ""Oil!"", but it is not, really.  Anderson takes one or two ideas from the novel, perhaps, but among other things, the names are all changed (Plainview and Sunday have been given Meaningful Names in lieu of the more ordinary Ross and Watkins), an the plot is different, focussing on the father character.  Most significantly, the moral of the story is completely reversed: the tycoon in Sinclair's novel is a genuinely likeable figure who is corrupt and brutal because the system is corrupt and brutal.  Anderson remakes this to the story of a sociopath who is rotten because of his own nature, with the system itself apart from him seen much more benignly.  There are mentions made of monopolies held by men like John D. Rockefeller, but all the other characters seem reasonable and cower in fear of Plainview.  Not that it isn't a good movie, but it seems a strange adaptation that completely changes the meaning of one of the great social commentators of the 20th century.All in all, I quite quite liked this movie; as a film, I felt it was much more wholistic than the Coens' ""No Country For Old Men"" (though my personal vote for the Oscar would have been ""Atonement"").",4,A strong film from Anderson.,1218844800,"08 16, 2008",2008,4025,"['Director', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'period', 'piece', 'skipping', 'further', 'back', 'time', 'then', 'did', 'famous', '1997', 'work', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'time', 'destination', 'United', 'States', 'early', 'years', '20th', 'century', 'brief', 'epilogue', 'set', 'time', 'Wall', 'Street', 'crash', '1929', 'subject', 'California', 'oil', 'industry', 'based', 'very', 'very', 'loosely', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', 'famous', 'book', 'Oil', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'second', 'Oscar-winning', 'role.The', 'story', 'Plainview', 'dream', 'earning', 'enough', 'money', 'separate', 'forever', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'general', 'rule', 'son', 'H.W.', 'who', 'actually', 'care', 'though', 'same', 'time', 'money', 'one', 'reminded', 'one', 'analysis', 'Shylock', 'said', 'most', 'charitable', 'thing', 'be', 'said', 'attitudes', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'daughter', 'ducats', 'least', 'reverse', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', 'Plainview', 'given', 'hot', 'tip', 'Paul', 'Sunday', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'huge', 'amounts', 'oil', 'home', 'town', 'hurries', 'buy', 'up', 'neighbouring', 'areas', 'major', 'other', 'character', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'also', 'Dano', 'would-be', 'evangelical', 'preacher', 'miracle-worker', 'Plainview', 'brutal', 'capitalism', 'Sunday', 'fundamentalist', 'religion', 'recalling', 'huckster', 'faith-healers', 'later', 'decades', 'business', 'grows', 'conflict', 'two', 'grows', 'based', 'minor', 'acts', 'spite', 'conflicting', 'worldviews.The', 'character', 'Plainview', 'movie', 'basically', 'played', 'Day-Lewis', 'volcanic', 'performance', 'mass', 'contradictions', 'impulses', 'genuinely', 'son', 'same', 'time', 'driven', 'greed', 'money', 'When', 'son', 'becomes', 'deafened', 'accident', 'Plainview', 'first', 'can', 'not', 'stay', 'beside', 'accident', 'later', 'struggling', 'deal', 'away', 'city', 'what', 'think', 'Plainview', 'regards', 'Sunday', 'most', 'offensive', 'act', 'face', 'up', 'action', 'show', 'genuine', 'weakness', 'desperation', 'escape', 'possible', 'wrath', 'God', 'Plainview', 'later', 'scene', 'climax', 'roles', 'reversed', 'remarkable', 'effect', 'Occasionally', 'violence', 'particularly', 'when', 'family', 'brought', 'up', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'later', 'victim', 'violence', ""n't"", 'like', 'people', 'times', 'want', 'reach', 'out', 'Ultimately', 'though', 'cynical', 'vengeful', 'black-hearted', 'old', 'man', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'would', 'be', 'appalled', 'by.Anderson', 'crew', 'meticulously', 'time', 'period', 'conveying', 'many', 'dangers', 'faced', 'pioneer', 'workers', 'early', 'oil', 'industry', 'More', 'one', 'many', 'grisly', 'death', 'result', 'sting', 'audience', 'as', 'sharply', 'bolts', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'airgun.On', 'note', 'often', 'called', 'adaptation', 'Sinclair', 'Oil', 'not', 'really', 'Anderson', 'one', 'two', 'ideas', 'novel', 'perhaps', 'other', 'things', 'names', 'are', 'changed', 'Plainview', 'Sunday', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'Meaningful', 'Names', 'lieu', 'more', 'ordinary', 'Ross', 'Watkins', 'plot', 'different', 'focussing', 'father', 'character', 'Most', 'significantly', 'moral', 'story', 'completely', 'reversed', 'tycoon', 'Sinclair', 'novel', 'genuinely', 'likeable', 'figure', 'who', 'corrupt', 'brutal', 'system', 'corrupt', 'brutal', 'Anderson', 'story', 'sociopath', 'who', 'rotten', 'own', 'nature', 'system', 'apart', 'seen', 'much', 'more', 'benignly', 'are', 'mentions', 'made', 'monopolies', 'held', 'men', 'John', 'D.', 'Rockefeller', 'other', 'characters', 'seem', 'reasonable', 'cower', 'fear', 'Plainview', 'Not', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'strange', 'adaptation', 'completely', 'meaning', 'one', 'great', 'social', 'commentators', '20th', 'century.All', 'quite', 'quite', 'liked', 'movie', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'wholistic', 'Coens', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'personal', 'vote', 'Oscar', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Atonement']",There Will Be Blood

1124511,AE9JH12P0CETA,B00104QSOM,S.G.R. Black,"[0, 2]","It's interesting to note that of the five films Paul Thomas Anderson has written and directed in the past 10 years, ""There Will Be Blood"" is his most famous and his most lucritive - pulling in a modest yet impressive 38 million dollars at the box office. His last ""hit"" was ""Boogie Nights"" (26 million dollars). It's quite an accomplishment.Still, it must be said that though I thought ""There Will Be Blood"" was an excellent film, easily the best of 2007, it's not at all one of Anderson's better films. Leave that for the far superior ""Magnolia"" and ""Boogie Nights"". Even ""Hard Eight"" and ""Punch Drunk Love"" surpass ""Blood"", at least in character study. Still, even with that said, ""There Will Be Blood"" is really good- bloody good.However, you've got to give Anderson some credit-and a hell of a lot- for such a departure. He leaves his familiar and beloved San Frenardo Valley setting in the dust for . . . dust and dry deserts; the old west. His elaborate ensemble mosaics are a thing of the past. Instead, his story is a period piece shot in the past (the late 1800s). Besides the masterful direction, there's nothing to even indicate that Anderson had anything to do with this film! It's so wonderful to see such a talented director actually stretch his talent and leave his comfort zone to see what he/she's capable of. He succeeds admirably.""There Will Be Blood"" is a carefully thought out idea from using Upton Sinclair's novel, ""Oil"", as inspiration to recruiting Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood to score the music, which I must say would have won for Best Original Score had it not been for the Academy's silly rules for selecting its nominees. *Speaking of the Academy's rules, there should be a rule that the nominees in the Best Director catagory should in fact be a director (singular) not directors (plural)! But that's a whole other story.*Anyway, ""Blood"" boasts exciting preformances from both Day-Lewis and Dano (who also should have at least been nominated-at least!). The cinemaphotography is stunning. The story of greed and corruption is timeless. The ending is nothing but satisfying. Those who are already fans of Anderson will have no problem enjoying this. Those who aren't familiar with his work are presented with an open door inviting them to explore his other films. Either way, ""There Will Be Blood"" is a great film from a great director that will one day have his shot at Oscar glory.

1124512,A34EBUNLYT3JNE,B00104QSOM,"Shane M. Warnick ""cinephile_12""","[4, 6]","Of all the films released this millennium thus far, ""There Will Be Blood"" is the most deserving to be immortalised. As epic as life itself, this film can be quite comparable to the story of the enduring ""Citizen Kane"". This film, simply put, is the rise of a self-made ""oilman"" and his decent into madness while it is supported by the lives and people he destroys along the way.This is not a happy film. The character of Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) is not a character much visited in film or even in real life, but it is not difficult to imagine someone so calculating and anti-social, and Day-Lewis' extraordinary portrayal of Plainview should not be taken as either exaggerated or over-acted, which is perhaps the most horrifying facet of the film. It is Day-Lewis' acting that takes the spotlight for this film's magic, I will admit that. It should not be missed. Some people will regard this as farcical acting and therefore unnecessary, but then some people are idiots. Some just do not see the big picture and see this as a character study. I didn't say one has to like it, just that one should not consider it superfluous.Day-Lewis' acting is a major highlight, but it is the director's talent that overall makes this a true work of art. Though it has a more Kubrick-esque approach, the director, P. T. Anderson, has made a spectacle that blends experimental methods, with classic techniques, and his own style; the result: a very, very well made film that can reach a wide audience. It can please the entertainment seekers, the film-as-an-art lovers, and the critics. Its scope is on par with ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Titanic"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and ""Ben-Hur"", but on a far more psychological and intimate level. It delves deep into the psyche of a cynical monster until he snaps and then the curtains close and the show is over. And it is the end that captivates me so. It is overly-fascinating. It draws fissions up the spine and they stay there. If only every film could have such a destructively wonderful conclusion.Yes, perhaps it was ""No Country For Old Men"" that won the Oscar for Best Picture, but I would love to see ""No Country For Old Men"" stand the test of time to be an eternal masterpiece by itself instead of just part of the Coen Brother's portfolio. If you want to see a movie, go see ""No Country For Old Men"", if you want to see a film, go see ""There Will Be Blood"". But, I'll stop bitching about something so irrelevant to this film's actual importance. So, all in all, ""There Will Be Blood"" will be a prevailing masterpiece in the history of film and should not be underestimated or disregarded, even if only for Day-Lewis' performance.",5,There Will Be Eternity,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,2685,"['films', 'released', 'millennium', 'thus', 'far', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'most', 'deserving', 'be', 'immortalised', 'As', 'epic', 'life', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'comparable', 'story', 'enduring', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'film', 'simply', 'put', 'rise', 'self-made', 'oilman', 'decent', 'madness', 'supported', 'lives', 'people', 'way.This', 'not', 'happy', 'film', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'not', 'character', 'much', 'visited', 'film', 'even', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'someone', 'so', 'calculating', 'anti-social', 'Day-Lewis', 'extraordinary', 'portrayal', 'Plainview', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'exaggerated', 'over-acted', 'perhaps', 'most', 'horrifying', 'facet', 'film', 'Day-Lewis', 'acting', 'spotlight', 'film', 'magic', 'will', 'admit', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'people', 'will', 'regard', 'farcical', 'acting', 'therefore', 'unnecessary', 'then', 'people', 'are', 'idiots', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'see', 'character', 'study', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'one', 'like', 'just', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'consider', 'superfluous.Day-Lewis', 'acting', 'major', 'highlight', 'director', 'talent', 'overall', 'true', 'work', 'art', 'more', 'Kubrick-esque', 'approach', 'director', 'P.', 'T.', 'Anderson', 'made', 'spectacle', 'experimental', 'methods', 'classic', 'techniques', 'own', 'style', 'result', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'can', 'reach', 'wide', 'audience', 'can', 'please', 'entertainment', 'seekers', 'film-as-an-art', 'lovers', 'critics', 'scope', 'par', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Titanic', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Ben-Hur', 'far', 'more', 'psychological', 'intimate', 'level', 'deep', 'psyche', 'cynical', 'monster', 'then', 'curtains', 'close', 'show', 'end', 'so', 'overly-fascinating', 'fissions', 'spine', 'stay', 'there', 'only', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'destructively', 'wonderful', 'conclusion.Yes', 'perhaps', 'was', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'be', 'eternal', 'masterpiece', 'instead', 'just', 'part', 'Coen', 'Brother', 'portfolio', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'go', 'see', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'go', 'see', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'bitching', 'something', 'so', 'irrelevant', 'film', 'actual', 'importance', 'So', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'will', 'be', 'prevailing', 'masterpiece', 'history', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'underestimated', 'disregarded', 'even', 'only', 'Day-Lewis', 'performance']",There Will Be Blood
1124513,A1VABWDOUQLULZ,B00104QSOM,S. K. Harrell,"[0, 2]","The many ways that greed manifests are countless in this film.  Virtually no character goes without claim on some level of selfishness when oil is discovered on otherwise useless California properties.  The lives of the inhabitants of a small farm community are turned upside down when the reality of what wealth can be gained dawns on them, as well as when they realize the price they will pay to have it.  The story is a believable exploitation of the land and lives of those striking out on the American frontier. Central to its conflict are Daniel Plainview, a slick oil prospector with the sincerity of a snake oil salesman, and Eli Sunday, the ambitious young pastor of a struggling country church.Day-Lewis Truly deserved all the accolades he won for his performance of Daniel Plainview in this film.  The range of his skills was wholly evident in this film, from the overall reserved and refined mannerisms of Plainview, to his later explosive and subtly vitriolic snide treatment of others.  In truth, every performance in this film was flawless.  In particular Paul Dano, Sunday, should have gotten more attention for his supporting role.  His passionate sermons were frightening and moving in his ability to swing from demure to suddenly thundering.  The physicality he brought to the character was entrancing as much as creepy.  I'm excited to think of what work he will do from this point forward.Overall the direction of the film seemed to be spot-on in delivery.  Most impressive to me were the great gaps in dialogue.  I'm always impressed when a scene is forced to move forward without speech.  That said, I'm not quite sure to what the poor pacing and seeming gaps in sequencing should be attributed.  In some places the film moved quite slowly, while sudden artless segu&eacute;s seemed to leave out huge chunks of time and plot development.  I also found the score to be extremely distracting throughout most of the film.  Indeed it was innovative and not what one would expect in a western...  Still, the musical arrangements were not only ill-suited for a lot of the film, but they were flat out too loud in much of it.All-in-all, the film is well done.

Some of the first things to strike me were how this film is beautifully directed with marvelous use of light and shadow and how the soundtrack helps keep things on edge with various percussive elements and discordant notes. But the key to this film really is Day-Lewis' performance and the whole film rests on his portrayal of Daniel Plainview, never has a film rested so strongly on one actors supreme work. This film doesn't have any real resolution, although some parts are tied up, but this looks at the overall life of this brutal and savage man as he exploits both community and nature for his gains in oil. At 2 and 1/2 hours it did begin to feel a touch long towards the end, but Day-Lewis manages to hold you captivated by his rich and in-depth performance and keeps you watching until the very end. The supporting actors play their roles well and Plainviews son was especially note-worthy.

1124518,A17QWJEEELWETQ,B00104QSOM,spiders-n-vinegaroons,"[2, 6]","I'll start off by saying that I found this film more engrossing than it's Best Picture rival No Country For Old Men, and that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our generation.  When he plays a role, HE IS the role.  I just love the way he pulls off that early 20th century look with the hairstyle, the mustache, and the trousers.  Truly amazing, he pulls it off to perfection.  The characters, the setting, and the scenery were quite exceptional and enjoyable.  The only reason TWBB is better for me than NCFOM is simply because there is much better acting and dialogue in this film hands down.  The film is also a period piece and helps the viewer relate a bit better to the characters and what type of environment they have around them.  For example, the scene where the supposed brother of Daniel Plainview is waiting by his house.  I think we all know who it is and why he's there even before he properly introduces himself to Daniel.  The man is dirt poor, and Daniel has just struck it rich.  Whether it was his brother, a relative, or an old friend, you know exactly that the both of them shared a past and that they are both meeting not by chance, but for opportunity.However in my honest opinion, both these afformentioned films don't seem to have a clear and decisive plot and above all else, a satisfactory conclusion to the story.  As excited as I was to see the great Daniel Day-Lewis on screen again, I cannot say the same for the film which is quite slow at times in delivering a particular scene and leaves you with an empty feeling afterwards.  The only true satisfaction I got (regarding the story) was finally seeing H.W. Plainview release himself from his father's control on his life.  It is a painful scene, but it's brilliant and was long overdue in the film.  The dialouge between characters was great, especially the lack of actual spoken dialogue between Daniel and his son towards the end of the film.  The grimaces, the smiles, the sarcasm, and the stares between Daniel and Eli Sunday were striking.Aside from all that, it pains me to say this, but again, I think the book and the film take another stab at God and at organized religion.  Now I may be reading too much into that, but when you think about it, most of the movie deals with God, religion, salvation, and conscience.  As a semi-religous person myself, I did not find a problem with the stab, I just found a problem with who in the end was right and who in the end was wrong.  Both characters when you look at it were villains.  Despicable people truly void of God or a conscience.  Eli was a self-righteous preacher who was in it for the money.  Daniel was an egotistical maniac who was in it for the money, the power, and the glory.  Not to mention he plays a horrible father figure to H.W.  So at the end of the film, are we to take away that a bigger ego defeated a smaller one, or that capitalism, greed, and self-righteousness conquers over God?  The ending leaves too much to be desired and doesn't present a strong enough conclusion to both protagonists.While I think it was merely a coincidence that NCFOM and TWBB were filmed in the same fashion, my only hope is that future films with such great capacity can successfully have a proper conclusion to the story and can no longer void itself of complete justice towards sociopathic villians like Daniel Plainview and Anton Chigurh.",3,There Will Be Blood,1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,3397,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'found', 'film', 'more', 'engrossing', 'Best', 'Picture', 'rival', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'generation', 'When', 'role', 'HE', 'role', 'just', 'love', 'way', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'look', 'hairstyle', 'mustache', 'trousers', 'Truly', 'amazing', 'off', 'perfection', 'characters', 'setting', 'scenery', 'were', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'reason', 'TWBB', 'better', 'NCFOM', 'simply', 'much', 'better', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'film', 'down', 'film', 'also', 'period', 'piece', 'viewer', 'relate', 'bit', 'better', 'characters', 'what', 'type', 'environment', 'have', 'around', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'supposed', 'brother', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'waiting', 'house', 'think', 'know', 'who', 'why', 'there', 'even', 'properly', 'Daniel', 'man', 'dirt', 'poor', 'Daniel', 'just', 'struck', 'rich', 'was', 'brother', 'relative', 'old', 'friend', 'know', 'exactly', 'shared', 'past', 'are', 'meeting', 'not', 'chance', 'opportunity.However', 'honest', 'opinion', 'afformentioned', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'clear', 'decisive', 'plot', 'else', 'satisfactory', 'conclusion', 'story', 'As', 'excited', 'was', 'see', 'great', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'screen', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'film', 'quite', 'slow', 'times', 'delivering', 'particular', 'scene', 'empty', 'feeling', 'afterwards', 'only', 'true', 'satisfaction', 'got', 'regarding', 'story', 'was', 'finally', 'seeing', 'H.W', 'Plainview', 'release', 'father', 'control', 'life', 'painful', 'scene', 'brilliant', 'was', 'long', 'overdue', 'film', 'dialouge', 'characters', 'was', 'great', 'especially', 'lack', 'actual', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'Daniel', 'son', 'end', 'film', 'grimaces', 'smiles', 'sarcasm', 'stares', 'Daniel', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'were', 'striking.Aside', 'say', 'again', 'think', 'book', 'film', 'take', 'stab', 'God', 'organized', 'religion', 'Now', 'may', 'be', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'think', 'most', 'movie', 'deals', 'God', 'religion', 'salvation', 'conscience', 'semi-religous', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'problem', 'stab', 'just', 'found', 'problem', 'who', 'end', 'was', 'right', 'who', 'end', 'was', 'wrong', 'characters', 'when', 'look', 'were', 'villains', 'Despicable', 'people', 'truly', 'God', 'conscience', 'Eli', 'was', 'self-righteous', 'preacher', 'who', 'was', 'money', 'Daniel', 'was', 'egotistical', 'maniac', 'who', 'was', 'money', 'power', 'glory', 'Not', 'mention', 'horrible', 'father', 'figure', 'H.W', 'So', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'take', 'away', 'bigger', 'ego', 'defeated', 'smaller', 'one', 'capitalism', 'greed', 'self-righteousness', 'conquers', 'God', 'ending', 'leaves', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'desired', ""n't"", 'present', 'strong', 'enough', 'conclusion', 'think', 'was', 'merely', 'coincidence', 'NCFOM', 'TWBB', 'were', 'filmed', 'same', 'fashion', 'only', 'hope', 'future', 'films', 'such', 'great', 'capacity', 'can', 'successfully', 'have', 'proper', 'conclusion', 'story', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'void', 'complete', 'justice', 'towards', 'sociopathic', 'villians', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Anton', 'Chigurh']",There Will Be Blood

1124520,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00104QSOM,S. Schell,"[2, 6]","Winner of two Academy Awards for Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Best Cinematography, ""There Will Be Blood"" is based upon the 1927 novel ""Oil!"" by Upton Sinclair and takes place in California during the early 20th century with an oil prospecter making his fortune.  Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), the aforementioned oilman, is a shrewd businessman and sees death early on as a part of life in the industry but it is only after he is challenged by a deceptive evangelist does death go from inadvertent to unmistakably discriminate.In a cacophonous mix of cutthroat business and zealous religion, a war is instigated when a young man named Paul Sunday (Dano) comes to Daniel and offers to point him in the direction of a surefire fortune in exchange for a handsome sum.  Paul's hometown village of ""Little Boston"" is a figurative gold mine, the family farm and the hundreds of miles surrounding it an untapped wealth of crude oil.  Under the guise of pheasant hunting enthusiasts, Daniel and his son H.W. (Freasier) start investigating the property and their suspicions are quickly confirmed.  Within no time, a deal is on the table but Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), a local preacher, impedes the contract by not only demanding a generous portion of the proceeds but also the chance to expand his modest congregation.  Hiding behind the faade of Christianity, he is motivated by greed, only to be unexpectedly matched by the cruelty and cunning of Daniel.The film is more than deserved of both of its Oscars, namely Day-Lewis's riveting performance as Daniel Plainview, a man who is torn between the love for his son and his love for self-affluence (or so one thinks).  The 52-year old Oscar winner's performance is matched by that of his 24-year old co-star Paul Dano as Eli Sunday.  Though he was cast as both of the Sunday brothers, it is as the sanctimonious Eli that Dano makes a pointed connection with the audience.  He is the character whom viewers love to hate, using religion to veil his egoism and his struggle for power, so much so that he aids in lending sympathy to Daniel, a man whose motivations are equally insatiate to his own.Stunning cinematography comes courtesy of Robert Elswit, a man who served as director of photography for P.T. Anderson's much-discussed `99 film ""Magnolia"".  Filmed in greater part in Marfa, Texas (neighboring with the cast and crew of ""No Country For Old Men""), Elswit recreates and highlights the best of old California's sweeping vistas, its rustic mountain ranges, rolling hills and dry desert-like tundra the picture-perfect backdrop.Paul Thomas Anderson has a short but unique body of work and this film has created the official apex of his career.  It is also a sign that there will be many more interesting projects to come from this 38-year old writer/director/producer.  Dusting off the ashes ten years after the outrageous cult favorite ""Boogie Nights"", ""There Will Be Blood"" is a definitive sign that this director has matured.Out of a total of 10 stars, I give it a 9.

1124521,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00104QSOM,Stanley Crowe,"[1, 1]","I didn't see this in the theater when it was released, but better late than never.  It's quite an experience, with a central performance by Daniel Day-Lewis that is simply remarkable.  He plays Daniel Plainview, a man who HAS to win -- he lives for competition -- and the realization that he does so seems to creep up gradually on him, to a point where all he can say when his adopted son indicates a determination to strike out on his own as an oilman in Mexico is ""You will be my competitor,"" even though (around 1930, when the movie ends) the younger man has gone to considerable lengths NOT to be drilling in places that would put him in competition with his father.  But to no avail -- he reviles the young man and sets a seal on their separation.  Daniel is a capitalist, of course, but the movie isn't making a political point -- what matters is the ego that fuels capitalism, and (following Upton Sinclair's novel that is a source for the movie) we are shown the ego -- the male ego, one would have to say -- equally willing to employ religion to aggrandize itself.  Daniel's double in the movie is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a young man whose family has leased Daniel land on which to drill in California, who relishes the power he exerts as founder-minister of the Church of the Third Revelation.  He and Daniel engage in a kind of slow-motion dance of mutual humiliation, the unfolding of which is the backbone of the movie's plot.But that unfolding takes place in a fully specified social and natural context, beautifully filmed and paced, with due attention paid to the kind of work that Daniel and his men do -- the opening scenes (c. 1890), practically wordless, which show us Daniel mining for precious metal, are vivid glimpses of hard physical labor, fraught with danger, and as we realize later, foreshadowing the Calvinistic idea of the fallen state.  Daniel's early physical fall is apt both as realistic circumstance and as symbol, and the later scenes underground with the oil, and the spectacular well-fire scene suggest the kind of hell to which Daniel has descended.  The scenes of interaction with his adopted son (whose father died working a well for Daniel) show glimmers of tenderness that become rarer and rarer.Why does this story resonate today?  I think that the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, has zeroed in on a tendency in our culture that manifests itself politically in the current right-leaning libertarianism and economically in the jargon of entrepreneurship that often accompanies it.  These are latter-day manifestations of an old myth in American culture -- the myth of the self-made man, and it's a myth that can easily morph into admiration for the megalomaniacal pseudo-philosophy that is associated with Ayn Rand.  Plainview, in his assertion that he hates people, is asserting the impossible dream of building and profiting with no help from anybody -- a kind of absolute self-reliance pushed to the point of parody.  Consequently, he wants to believe that all his relationships are economic ones, and that there is no moral constraint on how he maximizes his profits.  He wants to make as much as he can with as little outlay as possible -- to lease oil-rich land at a cost that a quail hunter might pay for HIS much less profitable pursuit.  And he'll haggle and cheat where he needs to, and he'll be suspicious of anyone who might seek to make a claim on him on other than economic grounds -- as we see when his supposed half-brother comes along.  The relation of this libertarianism to extreme Protestantism is brilliantly suggested by Anderson in making Eli Sunday the main antagonist to Plainview.  Both of these men come to know who and what they are, and damn the consequences.  The fact that they both end up in self-hatred isn't surprising either, when ""success'' in their terms seems to offer nothing beyond itself.There are two striking parallel climactic scenes between Daniel and Eli  -- in the first, Daniel undergoes a humiliating baptism/exorcism service simply in order to get drilling rights on a church member's land.  This gives Eli a chance, that he clearly relishes, to get back at Daniel for an earlier humiliation that Daniel has exacted on him.  Later, in the second, the roles are reversed, and Daniel forces Eli into an admission that shows (without giving too much away) that Daniel, for all his corruption, understands the corruption of Eli.  Were Eli and Daniel ALWAYS corrupt at heart?  The movie doesn't give a definitive answer -- there are early scenes of both that can be read either way, but by the end there's no doubt where they end up.  What's especially powerful by the end is Daniel's self-hatred, and that's what needs to be kept in mind in Daniel's assault on Eli in the famous (""I drink your milkshake"") final scene.  What he hates in Eli he hates in himself too, and the man in the big house who confronts Eli is well on the way to self-destruction too.These broad thematic comments don't do justice to the detail and texture of the movie.  I haven't mentioned Daniel's son's deafness, nor the sweet con man who comes along pretending to be Daniel's half-brother.  The detail of the early oilfield equipment and encampments, and the wheeling and dealing with both ordinary small farmers and rich tycoons -- all of that is marvelously rendered.  There's a dinner scene in a fancy restaurant where Daniel takes his deaf son that you won't soon forget . . . and so one could go on.  Five stars says ""I love it.""  I don't think it's a movie you love, but it makes an unforgettable impression.",5,"""I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul""",1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,5581,"['did', ""n't"",

1124524,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00104QSOM,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[3, 3]","""There Will Be Blood"" is one of the few films made in recent years that will be long remembered for something more than raking in bucks or featuring the latest flavor of the month topless.  That is to say, it's an instant classic.  Shot with a lyrical confidence that evokes both Bernardo Bertolucci's ""1900"" and Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven,"" it nonetheless firmly establishes its own identity, and if ""Boogie Nights"" or ""Punch-Drunk Love"" alone haven't convinced people that Paul Thomas Anderson is the most interesting American director working today, this film certainly should.  Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's ""Oil"" (but really having as much to do with ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" with a little ""Chinatown"" and ""Citizen Kane"" thrown in), the tragic drama stars Daniel Day-Lewis, perhaps the greatest British actor of his generation, as Daniel Plainview, an obsessive, sociopathic robber baron who in the first scene literally wills himself back to life and crawls across a desert not so much to safety, but to cash in his haul of silver.  Those first five minutes tell us everything we need to know about this character, who will go from bad to worse to worse yet in a depiction of unbridled greed that is refreshing in its brutal honesty.  In a country where greed is so often depicted in film as divinely ordained, Plainview will seem a theatrical canard to those who catch glimpses of themselves in him, or in his like-minded foil, the duplicitous Reverend Sunday (played with effete menace by Paul Dano).  Though Day-Lewis' portrayal sometimes threatens caricature of actor/director John Huston (whose fine works include ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""), and there seems to be an act missing before the disturbing but inevitable climax of the film, it's tough to find any real flaws in the work, whose raw soundtrack by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood is often as relentless as Plainview himself.

1124526,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00104QSOM,Steven Aldersley,"[0, 0]","If you ever explore threads asking people to list the movies they find the most boring, you'll see that There Will Be Blood is often mentioned. I can understand why. The opening 14-and-a-half minutes doesn't contain any dialogue unless you count the occasional grunt or cry of pain. The score is often unsettling and unlike anything you would expect to hear. The pacing is slow and the film has plenty of painful scenes.The opening scene is set in 1898 and gives us immediate insight into the character of Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis). We see him working alone, prospecting for oil. It's a physically demanding occupation which is full of danger. One small lapse can cause a severe injury or even death. Plainview falls down a well shaft and breaks his leg, but discovers oil in the process. We then see him crawl backwards as he slowly makes his way into town to register the find. He's one of the most stubborn and driven characters you will ever see portrayed on film.In 1902, he's working with a group of men, and we are reminded again how dangerous the work is. A tiny mistake results in the death of a man and Plainview adopts his orphaned baby boy.The story jumps forward several years and we see Plainview and his adopted son, HW, attending a town meeting. Plainview has discovered that the region contains oil and we see him making an offer to extract the oil. His argument is calm, reasonable, and logical. He's quite a salesman. He talks of other offers the town may receive and why his own proposal is the best solution for everyone. We are given the impression that he knows what he's talking about and it's difficult to resist his offer.When Plainview is visited by Paul Sunday (Dano), the main part of the film begins. Paul offers to reveal the location of land rich in oil and he negotiates a price for the information. Plainview visits the town and finds that the information is accurate. He begins buying up all the available land.The film contains a power struggle between Plainview and Eli Sunday (also played by Dano). Eli becomes Plainview's enemy immediately by negotiating a higher price for his father's ranch than Plainview expected to pay. Eli is also the town's priest and he seeks power and recognition at every available opportunity. Plainview sees him as a fake and doesn't seem to have any religious beliefs of his own, but he's forced to bow to Eli's wishes on several occasions.I've barely touched on the plot, but I won't reveal any more. This is a sprawling story spanning several decades. It's one of the most intense character studies that I've ever seen. You'll see how Plainview relates to other people and his adopted son. He's a ruthless businessman and it's dangerous to cross him. In one scene, we hear his honest thoughts on society:""I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people.""That last sentence is spoken with irony, but Plainview makes it clear that he understands his own true character. As the story progresses, we see what obsession and hatred can do to a man when it's maintained over a long period of time.My knowledge of film isn't as deep as you would expect for someone of my age. It's a relatively new obsession in my life. However, I believe that Daniel Day-Lewis delivers the best acting performance I have ever seen. I didn't doubt for a moment that he was a bitter, obsessed, driven man, capable of doing anything to bring him closer to his goals. Day-Lewis is in every scene and the film wouldn't have had the same impact without his astonishing performance.The technical aspects of the film are also superb. Jonny Greenwood's unusual score is particularly effective. One of my favorite moments happens during a drilling accident when the percussion increases in tempo as the scene unfolds. The cinematography is breathtaking at times. There's an early scene in which Plainview and HW approach the crest of a hill and the distant landscape is revealed. It's one of several moments of extreme beauty in the film.If the film has a fault, I would say that the final 20 minutes don't quite match the quality of the rest of the story. This closing sequence still works, and contains a few memorable moments, but the first two hours are close to perfect.If you enjoy character studies that aren't afraid to take the time to tell a story, There Will Be Blood might be your kind of film. If you need action and an upbeat conclusion, then it's probably not for you.",5,Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of the best performances I've ever seen,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,4453,"['ever', 'explore', 'threads', 'asking', 'people', 'list', 'movies', 'find', 'most', 'boring', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'often', 'mentioned', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'opening', '14-and-a-half', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'contain', 'dialogue', 'count', 'occasional', 'grunt', 'cry', 'pain', 'score', 'often', 'unsettling', 'anything', 'would', 'expect', 'hear', 'pacing', 'slow', 'film', 'plenty', 'painful', 'scenes.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'set', '1898', 'immediate', 'insight', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Day-Lewis', 'see', 'working', 'alone', 'prospecting', 'oil', 'physically', 'demanding', 'occupation', 'full', 'danger', 'One', 'small', 'lapse', 'can', 'cause', 'severe', 'injury', 'even', 'death', 'Plainview', 'down', 'well', 'shaft', 'breaks', 'leg', 'discovers', 'oil', 'process', 'then', 'see', 'crawl', 'backwards', 'slowly', 'way', 'town', 'register', 'find', 'one', 'most', 'stubborn', 'driven', 'characters', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'portrayed', 'film.In', '1902', 'working', 'group', 'men', 'are', 'reminded', 'again', 'how', 'dangerous', 'work', 'tiny', 'mistake', 'results', 'death', 'man', 'Plainview', 'orphaned', 'baby', 'boy.The', 'story', 'jumps', 'forward', 'several', 'years', 'see', 'Plainview', 'adopted', 'son', 'HW', 'attending', 'town', 'meeting', 'Plainview', 'discovered', 'region', 'oil', 'see', 'making', 'offer', 'extract', 'oil', 'argument', 'calm', 'reasonable', 'logical', 'quite', 'salesman', 'other', 'offers', 'town', 'may', 'receive', 'why', 'own', 'proposal', 'best', 'solution', 'everyone', 'are', 'given', 'impression', 'what', 'talking', 'difficult', 'resist', 'offer.When', 'Plainview', 'visited', 'Paul', 'Sunday', 'Dano', 'main', 'part', 'film', 'Paul', 'reveal', 'location', 'land', 'rich', 'oil', 'price', 'information', 'Plainview', 'town', 'information', 'accurate', 'buying', 'up', 'available', 'land.The', 'film', 'power', 'struggle', 'Plainview', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'also', 'played', 'Dano', 'Eli', 'Plainview', 'enemy', 'immediately', 'negotiating', 'higher', 'price', 'father', 'ranch', 'Plainview', 'expected', 'pay', 'Eli', 'also', 'town', 'priest', 'power', 'recognition', 'available', 'opportunity', 'Plainview', 'fake', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'own', 'forced', 'bow', 'Eli', 'wishes', 'several', 'occasions.I', ""'ve"", 'barely', 'touched', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'more', 'sprawling', 'story', 'spanning', 'several', 'decades', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'character', 'studies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'Plainview', 'other', 'people', 'adopted', 'son', 'ruthless', 'businessman', 'dangerous', 'cross', 'one', 'scene', 'hear', 'honest', 'thoughts', 'society', 'have', 'competition', 'want', 'one', 'else', 'succeed', 'hate', 'most', 'people', 'last', 'sentence', 'spoken', 'irony', 'Plainview', 'clear', 'own', 'true', 'character', 'story', 'see', 'what', 'obsession', 'hatred', 'can', 'do', 'man', 'when', 'maintained', 'long', 'period', 'time.My', 'knowledge', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'deep', 'would', 'expect', 'someone', 'age', 'relatively', 'new', 'obsession', 'life', 'However', 'believe', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'moment', 'was', 'bitter', 'obsessed', 'driven', 'man', 'capable', 'doing', 'anything', 'bring', 'closer', 'goals', 'Day-Lewis', 'scene', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'same', 'impact', 'astonishing', 'performance.The', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'superb', 'Jonny', 'Greenwood', 'unusual', 'score', 'particularly', 'effective', 'One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'drilling', 'accident', 'when', 'percussion', 'increases', 'tempo', 'scene', 'unfolds', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'times', 'early', 'scene', 'Plainview', 'HW', 'approach', 'crest', 'hill', 'distant', 'landscape', 'revealed', 'one', 'several', 'moments', 'extreme', 'beauty', 'film.If', 'film', 'fault', 'would', 'say', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'quality', 'rest', 'story', 'closing', 'sequence', 'still', 'few', 'memorable', 'moments', 'first', 'two', 'hours', 'are', 'close', 'perfect.If', 'enjoy', 'character', 'studies', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'take', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'might', 'be', 'kind', 'film', 'need', 'action', 'upbeat', 'conclusion', 'then', 'probably', 'not']",There Will Be Blood

The movie follows Daniel Plainview, an oil man, as he builds his company by buying up land and drilling.  Along the way, he encounters various rural people (some of whom stand in his way), and a few real tragedies occur.  It's interesting to see how Plainview acts increasingly insane in reaction to these situations.  As you can see, the plot is really thin.  This would be a three star movie if the Plainview character weren't so fascinating.  The ending is maybe the weirdest thing I've seen lately.

It really tries to be something that it isnt, and that is an art house epic.  I wonder sometimes if the hollywood moguls dont just spin a wheel of names and whomever it lands on becomes the ""genius"" of the year... it seems that way sometimes.I really think that the thing that threw some folks off in thinking that this is some sort of high brow art flick was the grating horror score that was seemingly thrown in wherever and whenever.I certainly couldnt see a decent plot inwhich to create a film around.. so one would simply think this a character study.  the only problem is that the only ""human"" charater in this whole film is the main character played brilliantly by Dan Lewis.  Lewis tried his very best like he always does. and the fact that he accomplished what he did with what he had to work with certainly earned him that oscar (thats why i gave it 3 stars).  Although, you cant help but see a very overt resemblence between this character and Bill the Butcher from The Gangs of New York. Really, if he wouldve slapped on a stove pipe top hat and started sharpening a knife one couldnt have told the difference.  I dont think that was Lewis's fault at all. he was most likely pushed to perform in that way by the ""genius of the month"" director.  another positive in this pic is the cinematography and lighting, which im sure is why some think it a great pic.  The photography is done really well, and obviously the director of cinematography was the true genius behind this film, as well as the editor.  but lewis, photography, and editing, no matter how good, cannot save a picture that was badly written, and is filled with 2 dimensional characters (some so laughable that its almost sickening.. or so sickening that its almost laughable).that said, youre not wrong for likeing this movie anymore than youre wrong for liking the color green; different strokes for different folks where art is concerned.  I may view this movie again 2 years from now and think its great, thats just how things are.  but right now i really cant see what others are seeing in this particular film.Another thing i really didnt like about this pic was the ending. it just seemed so silly and pointless,like the punchline to a really long and stupid joke.  people complained about the ending of ""no country for old men"", which I didnt understand at first.  but I think that ""blood's"" ending summed up the entire content of the film much more masterfully than ""no country's"" ending did for its own content... and that summation would have to be summed up in one word, 'silly'.netflix this bugger before you buy it, and watch it more than once. because, like i wrote before.. i could be wrong.enjoy!BTW: if you want to see a true artistic film that tackles the insanity and meaninglessness of the age old, and continueing, problem of violence; pick up ""no country for old men"". its also a true and masterfully made and acted character study.

In this movie about an ambitious oil wildcatter, the audience is never given a reason to care about the main character, Daniel Plainview (histrionically played by Daniel Day-hyphenation), or to understand the roots of his unbridled ambition.

1124532,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B00104QSOM,Terence Allen,"[0, 0]","There Will Be Blood, starring Daniel Day-Lewis and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is a powerfully realized, beautifully acted, written, and directed film. Adapted from the novel Oil by Upton Sinclair, ""Blood"" tells the story of Daniel Plainview, who is a silver miner in California in the late 1800s when he first strikes oil. From there, he becomes an oilman, skilled at going into communities and appealing to their sense of family and community, bringing his young son in tow to add to his allure.Plainview's character comes more and more into focus as he is alerted to a possible oil site in arid farmland. Taking his son with him, he investigates and decides to start buying property all around the area. But he comes in constant conflict with the twin brother of the young man who alerted him to the oil, a would-be faith-healer and preacher who has amassed a sizeable following in the town.What follows is fascinating, hearbreaking, and compelling, as Plainview singlemindedly pursues wealth and success without much regard to anything or anyone, even himself. By the end of the film, he is a broken man who could not have ended up any other way.To say that Day-Lewis' performance is a tour-de-force is an understatement. His Plainview is arrogant, contemptible, hateful, but at the same time tender and compassionate in his own way. He was more than deserving on an Oscar, and this film had the poor fortune to be released at the same time that the wonderful ""No Country For Old Men"" was released. Otherwise, Anderson would have won for Best Director and the film probably would have won Best Picture.There Will Be Blood serves as many things, but above all, it is a masterful piece of filmmaking and acting.",5,"For Anderson and Lewis, There Will Be Cinematic Immortality",1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1719,"['Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'starring', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'powerfully', 'realized', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'written', 'directed', 'film', 'Adapted', 'novel', 'Oil', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', 'Blood', 'story', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'who', 'silver', 'miner', 'California', 'late', '1800s', 'when', 'first', 'oil', 'there', 'oilman', 'skilled', 'going', 'communities', 'appealing', 'sense', 'family', 'community', 'bringing', 'young', 'son', 'tow', 'add', 'allure.Plainview', 'character', 'more', 'more', 'focus', 'alerted', 'possible', 'oil', 'site', 'arid', 'farmland', 'Taking', 'son', 'start', 'buying', 'property', 'area', 'constant', 'conflict', 'twin', 'brother', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'alerted', 'oil', 'would-be', 'faith-healer', 'preacher', 'who', 'amassed', 'sizeable', 'following', 'town.What', 'fascinating', 'hearbreaking', 'compelling', 'Plainview', 'singlemindedly', 'wealth', 'success', 'much', 'regard', 'anything', 'anyone', 'even', 'end', 'film', 'broken', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'other', 'way.To', 'say', 'Day-Lewis', 'performance', 'tour-de-force', 'understatement', 'Plainview', 'arrogant', 'contemptible', 'hateful', 'same', 'time', 'tender', 'compassionate', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'more', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'film', 'had', 'poor', 'fortune', 'be', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'wonderful', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'was', 'released', 'Otherwise', 'Anderson', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Director', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture.There', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'many', 'things', 'masterful', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'acting']",There Will Be Blood

1124534,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B00104QSOM,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[2, 2]","There Will Be Blood was one of the more surprising movies of last year. What initially struck me as a boring, pointless film thats only saving grace was Daniel Day-Lewis playing a character he already played later turned into one of my favorite movies. It's something you need to watch more than once to appreciate, as all of the magnificence of the movie comes in the form of all the little, unheralded aspects.The movie tells the tale of an oil man named Daniel Plainview in early 20th century America as he thirsts for more money and power, received in the form of controlling oil. There are many characters in the film who are important to the work as a whole, but the entire movie is very clearly placed in the (obviously) capable hands of Daniel Day-Lewis.Over the course of the American epic, Plainview meets and loses people, finds and loses things, and ultimately begins to question the very essence of humanity. No single moment in the film stands out as the pinnacle of Plainview's realization; rather the entire movie slowly works in a crescendo until you understand what he's seeing and going through.The main conflict comes in the form of Plainview and a holy man named Eli. Eli's twin brother sells Plainview the location of an oil rich area of California, and Eli convinces the town and church to allow Plainview to dig on the condition that he donates a portion to the church. (But are his motives truly that honorable? You'll have to watch and see.) The two continue to fight as Plainview refuses to pay, and it leads to one of the best confrontations between two characters I've seen in quite a while.The last third of the movie does struggle at times, but in my mind the ending portion is much, much better than what No Country left us with. Some will say There Will be Blood has no real ending and cops out, and to them I say: watch the movie again. Buy it on DVD, pay attention to the characters and their body language, and pay special attention to Plainview through the course of the movie. The end may not be the greatest end ever, but it is there, and the slow breakdown of Plainview from a giant among men to an emotionally crippled, instable, lonely man is brilliant to watch.CONTENT: 5/5There Will Be Blood was my choice for the best (American) movie of 2007, and after my fourth time watching it it still is. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of the decade as Daniel Plainview, and even if the rest of the film hadn't been this fantastic, it would still be a movie worth watching and owning just to see him do his thing. Amazingly, we get a movie that supports Day-Lewis in his larger than life role, and which was completely robbed by the Coens at the Oscars.VIDEO: 4/5You get the widescreen presentation of the film enhanced for 16:9 TVs, and there's almost no color loss from the theater. While it would have been awesome to have in HD, it looks great for a standard DVD. Blacks are dark, and there's no real issues with darker scenes on tube TVs.AUDIO: 3.5/5The surround presentation could have been used to a greater extent, but it still sounds good. With English, French and Spanish 5.1 support, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone who can't appreciate the movie. Of course, hearing Daniel Plainview in French isn't quite the same, but still.REPLAY: 4/5Is it long? You bet. Can you watch it again? Definitely. The sign of a truly great picture is that you can view it repeatedly, and There Will Be Blood passes that test. The little interactions and often unseen things which pass between characters are picked up upon in succeeding viewings, and Daniel Plainview is amazing every time.EXTRAS: 3/5Sadly, the second disc doesn't offer that much with There Will Be Blood. I was hoping for more given the nature of the film--and what we get is solid--but there's just not enough. There's a short historical documentary, ""The Story of Petroleum,"" which is the meat and potatoes of the extras, but aside from that nice little view into America's past, the disc is lacking. There's no commentary from Paul Thomas Anderson--or anything including him in the special features--and that strikes me as incredibly odd. There is a nice bit which shows (briefly) how Day-Lewis created the Plainview persona over time, but again, too little for the epic they're supposed to supplement.OVERALL: 4.5/5Is the special edition a little weak? Yup. Is the case a little odd? Yup. (It's a cardboard sleeve case, in case you were wondering.) Still, There Will Be Blood is one of the best movies of the century, and easily the best of 2007. Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of the most memorable performances in movie history, and the rest of the movie is much better than you initially think. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up so you don't miss out. If you have seen it and thought it was overrated, rent the DVD, give it a re-watch, and then make your conclusion. There Will Be Blood is an American epic in every sense of the word, and Paul Thomas Anderson seemingly did the impossible by outdoing himself.",5,Better than No Country,1249689600,"08 8,

1124535,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00104QSOM,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[16, 18]","Featuring a phenomenal performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood brings to life as charismatic and captivating a character as any to grace the screen this year. Comparable to the epic journeys of Charles Foster Kane and Fred C. Dobbs, the mesmerizing progression of Daniel Plainview from prospector to oil entrepreneur and ""family man"" makes a compelling character study rich with the flaws of greed, hubris, and competition. Traversing several decades of Plainview's struggles with family, the church, and the business he so loves, There Will Be Blood meticulously recreates a time, a place, and a man with feverishly brilliant detail.In 1898, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a determined prospector who strikes silver in Texas and in subsequent searches discovers oil. By 1911 Plainview is a self-proclaimed ""oil man"" who operates several wells with his adopted son. When he's approached by Paul Sunday, who swears there is oil literally seeping out of the ground on his father's ranch, Daniel expands his business and begins buying up all of the property in the area. Such aggression doesn't go unnoticed however, and the ambitious businessman soon finds himself at odds with larger oil companies and the fanatical local church led by the guileful Eli Sunday (Paul Dano).The music by composer Jonny Greenwood is sensational, and perfectly complements every scene. At times the violins screech like a frenetic horror film, amplifying the atrocities of Plainview versus himself or presiding over introductions to marked location shifts, and at others it is melodic and impassioned, contrasting the contemplation of despicable character choices. Music plays during most of the film, tying together speechless segments and narrating the tone of conversations. Beautifully orchestrated, it is ever-present and manifest, but never interrupts the visuals onscreen.Religion plays a strikingly offbeat role in the film, primarily in the form of Eli Sunday. A truly fanatical leader and a proclaimed ""false"" prophet, Eli attempts to further himself and his church through interfering with Daniel's oil prospects. Although Plainview is also unscrupulous and irrational, Eli's unbalanced preacher role is so immoderate that it clearly displays religion as discordantly nonsensical. His performance is obsessively masterly, and his comeuppance at the conclusion packs a bigger punch than this year's Michael Clayton, with its undeniable crowd-pleasing finale.Daniel will do anything for his oil pipeline, symbolizing the idea of wealth and perseverance as opposed to necessity, including receiving a baptism in Eli's Church, an act he loathes. Grimacing through the entire derisory process, with which Eli takes perverse pleasure in tormenting the unbelieving Daniel, he gets his pipeline and later his revenge.Daniel Day-Lewis embodies Plainview with such passion, authenticity and an overwhelming screen presence that an Academy Award certainly won't elude him. His dismal declension from a two-faced, shrewd businessman to an emotionally unstable soulless shell, who can barely stay sober and who, despite having everything has lost everything worthwhile, is effortlessly the greatest of this year. Comparison to Citizen Kane is natural due to Plainview's downward-spiraling character arc and his aberrant greed slowly separating him from humanity, but There Will Be Blood covers ground that Orson Welles' masterpiece approached dissimilarly- the love of his son and the times they spent together replace Kane's cherishing of his childhood.Daniel's separation from his child both physically and emotionally doesn't come entirely from avarice, but from Daniel's inability to enjoy other's company sincerely. He hates most man and sees the evil in everyone, a self-loathing complex that causes his brash decisions to steadily become more volatile. ""I have a competition in me,"" Daniel seethes.

I'll just add my opinion that the best thing about this movie was the very interesting and accurate look at the technology and methodology of drilling for oil in the early days. This part of the movie was masterfully done!But much of the rest of it was simply inaccurate, and it looked it.  Beginning with the idea that this was supposed to be set in California.  I've been all over California and none of what I saw looked like the countryside in this movie. *** I've edited this to say that I'm wrong in having said that this didn't look like California. Californians have commented that some parts of the state do. After researching it, large parts of this movie were, in fact, filmed in California, but significant portions of it was filmed in the Marfa, Texas, area which is indeed close to the Permian Basin oil fields. ***Caricatures and stereotypes... the vicious, insanely-bad, blood-thirsty oil man, and, the devious, deceiving, self-interested evangelist preacher. Oh, yes, two evil icons of our time, excoriated in this propped-up farce for the audience to share vicarious thrills of condemnation for?  No, this part of the movie was lethally wrong, and the word, ""Overkill"" comes to mind....  Are there crooked, hypocritical preachers and psychopathic, manipulating oil men?

1124538,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00104QSOM,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[2, 4]","Paul Thomas Anderson's allegorical update of Upton Sinclair's ""Oil"" follows Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, the two men hell-bent of besting the other as their lives are chronicled in ""There Will Be Blood."" Daniel Day Lewis' Oscar winning portrayal of Plainview is easily one of the decade's finest, yet little has been said of Paul Dano's job as Paul/Eli Sunday. As Eli, he is the dark side to faith that mirrors Plainview's ruthless competition.Early in the film, as Plainview conspires to grab the land around Little Boston, Eli asks for 10,000 dollars ""for the church."" Plainview snorts and sneers ""that's a good one."" Plainview already sees the Preacher's phoniness, which he continues to exploit as the movie grinds towards its climax. Still, Dano's simple but scheming portrayal of a man who uses God in his ruse much the same as Plainview uses the orphaned HW went unheralded next to Lewis' larger-than-life Oil Baron.And what an amazing character Plainview is. There is not a spoken word for the movie's first 10 minutes, relying only on Plainview's mannerisms and Johnny Greenwood's grating score. Soon Plainview becomes a rough-hewn but slick-salesman, all too willing to ruthlessly suck the land dry from under them because he can. ""I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people,"" he says to his brother...and then a betrayal soon after codifies Plainview's logic even further.When the two final betrayals occur at the end of the movie, Daniel Plainview's seething, stored hatred erupts as the final consequence in a life made of cruel ambition from a man who can only see the worst in people. The explosion of violence in a beautiful mansion highlights the contradiction even more, as Eli proves that he's just as willing to sell his soul as Plainview is eager to avenge his lack of one.Exquisitely filmed and languidly paced, ""There Will Be Blood"" is a terrific piece of work. Too bad, as many have pointed out, that it comes packaged in a shoddy fold-over cardboard cover that looks like you'd just bought some public domain cheapie from the corner mini-mart.

1124540,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00104QSOM,Tom Benton,"[2, 4]","Since hitting it big with 1997's critically-lauded ""Boogie Nights,"" Paul Thomas Anderson has stood in the front ranks of American filmmakers.  Actually, Anderson has crouched in the front ranks, dreaming about what would make a great shot and how he could do this scene or that scene, while all the other filmmakers stand around and chat.  For his fifth film, ""There Will Be Blood,"" Anderson has set aside his trademark Altman-esque lushness for a style which recalls Francis Ford Coppola in his prime.  Finally, Anderson stands in the front ranks - and it comes as no surprise that he has perfect posture.The spine of ""There Will Be Blood"" is Daniel Day-Lewis, who stars as oil-drilling entrepeneur Daniel Plainview.  It is the single greatest performance of Day-Lewis' distinguished career as an actor.  To go further, it is one of the greatest performances in cinematic history.  Daniel Plainview is one of the most fascinating and complex protagonists ever seen on the big screen.  I use the term ""protagonist"" loosely.  Plainview is as slimey as the oil he has devoted his life to drilling, and as dangerous as the tools he uses to do so.  He may look human, he may sound human, and at times he may even act like a genuine human being, but if there is any humanity in this man, it is buried deeper than the oil he drills.Plainview swindles people out of their homes, their property, their fortunes, without a care.  But what makes the character so interesting is the sneaking suspicion that he's not completely cold, that there is humanity in the depths of his soul, or was, at one point.  It seems like he may love his adopted son, H. W. (Dillon Freasier) - but just when we're sure he does, Anderson pulls the rug out from under our feet.  Plainview's memories of ""back home,"" recounted to his brother Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), are worth noting.  Plainview talks about a house he saw when he was a boy.""I thought as a boy that was the most beautiful house I'd ever seen, and I wanted it,"" Plainview remembers.  ""I wanted to live in it, and eat in it, and clean it.  And even as a boy, I wanted to have children to run around in it.""Henry points out that Plainview can have anything he wants now.  He can make his own house, one that looks just like the house from his childhood.Plainview grimaces.  ""I'm sure if I saw that house now,"" he spits, ""it would make me sick.""It's one of two scenes in the film which offer glimpses into Plainview's soul, or what remains of it.  The second also involves Henry: this time, Plainview admits, ""I see the worst in people.  I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need.  I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little ... I can't keep doing this on my own, with all these ... people.""  He spits out the last part as though he'd swallowed an insect, and then he laughs.  The world is his own private joke.But there can be no joking about Day-Lewis' performance.  Daniel Plainview is in his eyes.  He's in the way he talks, the way he moves, the way he breathes.  He is Daniel Plainview.  And though the film rests upon his broad and sturdy shoulders, he is supported by a similarly talented cast.Highlighting the supporting cast is young Paul Dano, last seen as the irritating emo kid from ""Little Miss Sunshine.""  Dano, as the media has noted, plays two different roles: brothers Paul and Eli Sunday.  Paul Sunday appears in only one scene, informing Daniel Plainview of the wealth of oil ready to be drilled on the Sunday farm.  Eli Sunday is, essentially, the head of the Sunday family, and even the head of the town.  He leads the local church, and delivers passionate sermons that are, frankly, godawful.  He is also the thorn in Daniel Plainview's side.  It's the perfect role for Dano to showcase a depth not even hinted at in his previous roles.  He may be one to watch out for in the future.Dillon Freasier is also noteworthy.  There is something absolutely fascinating about his distant and confused portrayal of H. W. Plainview.  He seems like the embodiment of all the good devoid from his adoptive father.  This is Freasier's first film role, but he's already make his mark.Paul Thomas Anderson, on the other hand, made his mark a decade ago, but only with ""There Will Be Blood"" has he truly had an impact on cinematic history.  Though elements of the film may recall the work of Stanley Kubrick, or the work of Robert Altman (who was one of the biggest influences on Anderson's previous films), this is the first film Anderson has made which has felt wholly original.  It's the work of a true visionary.  Finally, Anderson feels like the god behind-the-scenes who ties together all the threads of existence, rather than the gifted puppetmaster with a vision as he may have seemed before.  Each shot, stunningly photographed by Robert Elswit, has a beautiful directness which recalls the glory days of Hollywood studio epics.Thematically, ""There Will Be Blood"" recalls one classic in particular: John Huston's ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre.""  Huston's dark masterpiece, which revolved around two beggars who wind up a trip to Mexico and discover a wealth of gold in the hills, has a lot in common with Anderson's own bleak masterpiece.  Both portray the corruption of the human soul as inevitable, although ""Blood"" is a little less harsh in its delivery of the statement.  At the start of each film, audiences are allowed the tiniest bit of hope, which is gradually squeezed until there is nothing left to do but submit to this frightening vision of humanity.  Lastly, both films end on a comic note, albeit a blood-stained note for Anderson's film.  He's said that he watched ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" every night during production before going to bed.  Suffice to say it shows.As far as editing goes, ""There Will Be Blood"" owes a lot to the taut, scene-into-scene style of Stanley Kubrick, particularly ""The Shining.""  ""Blood"" is edited by Dylan Tichenor, who also edited ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia.""  ""Boogie Nights""' pacing recalled the work of Martin Scorsese, while ""Magnolia"" moved with the frenetic pacing of an Altman movie on crack.  Anderson's last picture, 2002's ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" is among the most lush, dreamy movies in recent memory; that film's editing was smooth and breezy.  Even the most astute moviegoer would have a hard time believing that the same man who brought you the film where Adam Sandler acts or the movie where the sky rains frogs has now brought us this hulking, somber reflection on the human spirit.One final note: the score is composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood.  As one might expect, it's a bit of an oddity, which makes it all the more fitting for a movie like this.  It is certainly among the most sparse film scores in history, but its unusual instrumentation renders it one of the more interesting and potent soundtracks of the new millennium.Just how good is ""There Will Be Blood""?  It's good enough to drink the milkshake of any other movie released this decade.  It is the finest film of 2007, surpassing even the Coens' extraodinary ""No Country for Old Men"" - but better still, it's one of the best movies ever made.  Very, very few films this century have come near this level of greatness - in fact, only Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy comes to mind.  ""There Will Be Blood"" is a film which makes a powerful statement through powerful filmmaking.  Its performances are peerless, its photography is beautiful and direct, its editing is classically tight, and its direction - well, P. T. Anderson may not be Scorsese or Coppola yet, but by god, he's on his way.",5,Blood as thick as oil,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,7622,"['hitting', 'big', '1997', 'critically-lauded', 'Boogie',

1124544,A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,B00104QSOM,Tristan,"[15, 29]","Paul Thomas Anderson once again fashions an original and ambitious film of layers filled with challenging themes that, despite producing an occasional scene of brutal realism, fails to be that good. This two-hour and forty-minute story of one man's greedy ambition and his unwavering quest for wealth at whatever cost, reminded me of a Charles Dickens story where all the characters are caricatures--and that is not a good thing.Daniel Plainview is an oilman who is seeking to make a fortune by finding a piece of real estate with a profitable oil well. He has no family except for a baby boy he adopts and quickly turns into his young prodigy. He is approached by a boy, Paul (played by Paul Dano), who tells him of a ranch where there is such an abundance of oil it is seeping out of the ground. This is all Daniel needs to hear before setting off to find it. When he arrives he quickly goes about buying up the ranch as well as all the surrounding land and then with a crew starts drilling. He does run into some confrontation with Eli (also played by Paul Dano) the brother of Paul. Eli realizes the oil is worth something and wants a share of the profit for his church which he is minister of. Daniel agrees to this, but once he strikes oil and starts raking in money, he completely ignores his deal with Eli as his true colors are shown and he slowly turns completely bitter to everyone around him.This is one of those films that seems to easily garner many award nominations and termed ""masterpiece!"", but when you go see it you are left wondering if you saw the same film. There were simply too many flaws in this film to be even close to a masterpiece.To start, as I said before there are moments of true brilliance and some scenes were so engrossing that you would hang on every motion and line of the characters only to be shut back out the moment the scene was over or the acting would become so ferocious that serious parts were almost humorous. PTA, the director, seems to have this style of pushing his actors almost into the territory of over-acting (as was the case of Tome Cruise and Julian Moore in Magnolia).The production was nothing new or magnificent. The cinematography was mediocre almost annoying at parts as it showed close-ups for extended periods of time. The score was a ""nail-on-chalkboard"" type with every note out of tune and absolutely no melody just repetitive clicking, banging, or stringing contrasted against the silence of the plains.For the story to be almost three hours long it was too focused on the main character, so that the supporting characters (none of who are women) appear more like those extras who just have a few lines before they head to the next studio. Because of this fact I felt the reality was taken out of it as Daniel Plainview seemed to exist in his own world were there was no society and the people surrounding him were so vacant of any character that everyone did as he said. Also the lack of a female character (supporting or main) was a big mistake.I give this film points for trying to bring a message, but there were too many messages and themes that got mixed together so at the end I was wondering if it was trying to show the affects of greed, money cannot buy happiness, capitalism vs. religion, etc. All of these themes are good but when they are not made clear enough.Lastly I feel that since it is not an entertaining film, it is more a character study filled with different themes to critically analyze (which I LOVE) the director should have chosen a different actor and story to illustrate those themes instead of oil drilling, Daniel-Day Lewis and nearly three hours of screen time (half of which has Daniel covered in oil beyond the point of recognition).",2,The Most Overrated Film of 2007!,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,3737,"['Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'once', 'again', 'fashions', 'original', 'ambitious', 'film', 'layers', 'filled', 'challenging', 'themes', 'producing', 'occasional', 'scene', 'brutal', 'realism', 'be', 'good', 'two-hour', 'forty-minute', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'greedy', 'ambition', 'unwavering', 'quest', 'wealth', 'cost', 'reminded', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'story', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'caricatures', 'not', 'good', 'thing.Daniel', 'Plainview', 'oilman', 'who', 'seeking', 'make', 'fortune', 'finding', 'piece', 'real', 'estate', 'profitable', 'oil', 'well', 'family', 'baby', 'boy', 'quickly', 'young', 'prodigy', 'approached', 'boy', 'Paul', 'played', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'who', 'ranch', 'where', 'such', 'abundance', 'oil', 'seeping', 'ground', 'Daniel', 'needs', 'hear', 'setting', 'off', 'find', 'When', 'quickly', 'buying', 'up', 'ranch', 'as', 'well', 'surrounding', 'land', 'then', 'crew', 'drilling', 'run', 'confrontation', 'Eli', 'also', 'played', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'brother', 'Paul', 'Eli', 'oil', 'something', 'share', 'profit', 'church', 'minister', 'Daniel', 'once', 'oil', 'raking', 'money', 'completely', 'deal', 'Eli', 'true', 'colors', 'are', 'shown', 'slowly', 'completely', 'bitter', 'everyone', 'him.This', 'one', 'films', 'easily', 'garner', 'many', 'award', 'nominations', 'termed', 'masterpiece', 'when', 'go', 'see', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'saw', 'same', 'film', 'were', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'film', 'be', 'even', 'close', 'masterpiece.To', 'start', 'said', 'are', 'moments', 'true', 'brilliance', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'engrossing', 'would', 'hang', 'motion', 'line', 'characters', 'only', 'be', 'shut', 'back', 'moment', 'scene', 'was', 'acting', 'would', 'become', 'so', 'ferocious', 'serious', 'parts', 'were', 'almost', 'humorous', 'PTA', 'director', 'have', 'style', 'pushing', 'actors', 'almost', 'territory', 'over-acting', 'was', 'case', 'Tome', 'Cruise', 'Julian', 'Moore', 'Magnolia', '.The', 'production', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'magnificent', 'cinematography', 'was', 'mediocre', 'almost', 'annoying', 'parts', 'showed', 'close-ups', 'extended', 'periods', 'time', 'score', 'was', 'nail-on-chalkboard', 'type', 'note', 'tune', 'absolutely', 'melody', 'just', 'repetitive', 'clicking', 'banging', 'stringing', 'contrasted', 'silence', 'plains.For', 'story', 'be', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'was', 'too', 'focused', 'main', 'character', 'supporting', 'characters', 'none', 'who', 'are', 'women', 'appear', 'more', 'extras', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'few', 'lines', 'head', 'next', 'studio', 'fact', 'felt', 'reality', 'was', 'taken', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'seemed', 'exist', 'own', 'world', 'were', 'was', 'society', 'people', 'surrounding', 'were', 'so', 'vacant', 'character', 'everyone', 'did', 'said', 'Also', 'lack', 'female', 'character', 'supporting', 'main', 'was', 'big', 'mistake.I', 'give', 'film', 'points', 'trying', 'bring', 'message', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'messages', 'themes', 'got', 'mixed', 'together', 'so', 'end', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'affects', 'greed', 'money', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'happiness', 'capitalism', 'vs.', 'religion', 'etc', 'themes', 'are', 'good', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'enough.Lastly', 'feel', 'not', 'entertaining', 'film', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'filled', 'different', 'themes', 'critically', 'analyze', 'LOVE', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'different', 'actor', 'story', 'illustrate', 'themes', 'instead', 'oil', 'drilling', 'Daniel-Day', 'Lewis', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'screen', 'time', 'half', 'Daniel', 'covered', 'oil', 'point', 'recognition']",There Will Be Blood

1124547,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00104QSOM,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","Loosely based upon the novel OIL by Upton Sinclair, writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson takes a portion of Sinclair's original story and makes it his own in THERE WILL BE BLOOD, a movie about greed, oil, power, and duplicity.  THERE WILL BE BLOOD follows the life of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis).  For the first fifteen minutes of the movie, not a word is spoken.  The audience watches as Plainview seems to be mining for gold, but is instead ultimately looking for oil.  He slowly continues digging for black gold, eventually pulling it out from the ground one bucket at the time.  Time progresses and a small crew is added.  Tragedy strikes the crew and the baby of one of the workers is left orphaned.  Plainview takes the child and adopts the boy as his own to use as a prop as he travels across the country asking people to let him mine their oil for them.Years later in 1911, Plainview is approached by a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano).  Sunday is from a small community called Little Boston and he tells Plainview that there is so much oil in his hometown that it seeps out of the ground when it rains.  In exchange for some money, he shows Plainview the location of the land and disappears from the story.  Plainview and H.W.(Dillon Freasier), his son, investigate the land and discover that what Paul said was indeed true.  Without mentioning Paul, Plainview befriends the Sunday family and impresses upon them what he wants to do and how important it is.  At first the family isn't impressed, particularly Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), but after listening to Plainview's eloquent speech and being satisfied that the new industry will benefit not only the town but Eli's church, the family agrees and promises to get the other townspeople together for a meeting.  As the drilling for the oil commences, so, too, does the power struggle between Eli and Daniel.  They both are greedy and hunger for power, but use very different means and arenas to obtain it.The final portion of the film fastforwards to 1927, allows the audience to see what has become of the majors characters, and gives the story an incomplete coda.  Daniel is wealthy beyond one's imagination, but is so eaten up by suspicion, hatred, and greed that he disowns H.W.  Meanwhile, Eli has become an internationally known preacher, but has almost become as corrupt as Daniel.The acting in THERE WILL BE BLOOD is astonishing.  Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game, which is saying a lot for a man who sometimes takes years to study for a role and immerse himself into the character.  Day-Lewis offered the strongest performance of the year and well deserved the Best Actor Oscar he received.  Paul Dano also gives a wonderful performance, and even though he was overlooked by the Academy, he should have at least been nominated for a Supporting Actor award.  Day-Lewis had over a year to study for his role, but Dano was cast as Eli Sunday after shooting on the film had already begun.Another component of THERE WILL BE BLOOD that I really enjoyed was the score by Johnny Greenwood.  The music in the film is full of dissonance, which reflects the inner turmoil of the characters beneath the cool exteriors and posing relationships they have with each other.  The music screeches and shrieks, yet like the Sirens' call there is something mysteriously enchanting about it.THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a dark and sometimes disturbing drama about greed, power, duplicity, and ultimately murder.  Cinematically the film is comparable the CITIZEN KANE, but the two movies are very different.  KANE offers the story of a man corrupted by power who had some redeeming characteristics, but THERE WILL BE BLOOD follows the story of a man consumed by evil with no redeeming characteristics.

A man who literally dug his first oil strike with his own hands, Plainview becomes a swindler and, eventually, a murderer. He twists the oil out of the land by taking advantage of rural people who are too naive to understand his purposes. He goes head-to-head with rural fundamentalist preacher, Eli Sunday who is one of the few people able to understand Plainview's corruption, but who later falls victim to corporate greed himself. Upton Sinclair wrote the original novel upon which this film is based, ""Oil"". Daniel Day Lewis embeds himself in the corporate robber baron, Plainview.

1124557,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00104QSOM,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[574, 634]","When is a ""Collector's Edition"" not a collector's edition? When the second disc barely has an one hour's worth of additional featurettes and other extras. ""There Will Be Blood"" deserved to be recognized as one of the finest films from last year. That's not to say the film is perfect but its flaws are pretty easy to overlook because of Paul Thomas Anderson's sweeping and ambitious storytelling. I'd recommend the single disc edition as the ""Collector's Edition"" doesn't have all that much in the way of extras. The single disc edition is really all you need even though it doesn't have ANY extras.The packaging for this set is horrible (which I could forgive if the discs weren't scratched up in the process). How did this get past the marketing department at Paramount?""There Will Be Blood"" based on Upton Sinclair's novel OIL! gives us two portraits of two very different men both ruled by their own obsession--Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis in his Oscar winning role who seems to be channeling John Huston from the film ""Chinatown"")an oil man who in spite of his impressive skills as a smooth talking salesman, doesn't like people very much (aside from his son H.W. which he uses to help sell people that his is ""a family business"") and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano)a smooth talking healer and leader of the Church of the Third Relevation. Both men want wealth and power for Plainview its a means to escape. While Sunday sees the oil leaking out of the ground of his father's ranch to gather a flock, reach out with his message and, in turn, gain the power that he believes he deserves. The two men don't get along from the moment they meet--Eli is on to Daniel's ""plain speaking"" way of doing business and getting something for next to nothing and Daniel believes that Eli is a charlatan. In their own way each is a hard nosed uncompromising businessman with visions that don't mesh.The DVD:Robert Elswit's cinematography deservedly won an Oscar for the film and while the DVD transfer looks good, the night sequences are a bit murky and dark. Detail overall is pretty good with a color scheme that accurately captures the theatrical look of the film.Audio sounds terrific nicely reproducing Johnny Greenwood's score.There are no extras on the first disc which has a menu as plain as Daniel's view of the world. The second disc features a vintage silent featurette that runs about 27 minutes and uses Greenwood's score to accompany it. It tells the ""story"" of oil and shows us how oilmen hunted for it and brought it to market.We also get ""15 Minutes"" a collection of vintage stills from the era taken around oil sites, behind-the-scenes footage and various clips showing all the work that Anderson and his crew put into researching the film. It's a silent segment accompanied by music and lasts, yep, just over 15 minutes.Next up we two deleted scenes that last nearly ten minutes. Under three minutes ""Dallies Gone Wild"" is an alternate take of the restaurant scene involving Daniel, his son H.W. and employees of Standard Oil.We also get the teaser for the film and the original theatrical trailer both of which remind me of the lost art of crafting a great trailer that will pull in an audience without giving away too much. All things considered, this is a disappointing ""Collector's Edition"" even with the awkward collectable packaging that is included (where the discs slide inside) and would be prone to damage with time.Conclusion: A powerful, terrific film and one of the ten best from 2007, ""There Will Be Blood"" appears in a disappointing special edition from Paramount. The film looks fine and the soundtrack is brilliantly rendered which should be enough to get fans to purchase the single disc DVD and that's what I would recommend.The extras on disc two of the ""Collector's Edition"" are slim pickings to say the least. It's as if Paramount rushed to pull this material together in light of the Academy Award nominations and wins the film scored. They are very disappointing for a two disc edition and I can't strongly recommend the two disc edition based on this. If you just want the film, go for the single disc edition and wait to see what the Blu-ray comes packs in the way of special features.A reminder...Voting at amazon.com is about whether or not the review helped you decide to purchase the product NOT about whether or not you agree with the reviewer.

Whether it's a great film is debatable. But there's no question it's an absolute knockout -- for its acting, cinematography, and music.""There Will Be Blood"" is another in Hollywood's long line of left-wing ""I hate American society"" films. I love such movies (we need them now more than ever), especially when they attack fundamental American values such as greed, hypocrisy, materialism, and shallow religiosity. This one strikes with a Panzer division and cruise missiles.The meaning of the title is not altogether clear. I interpret it as the second part of the statement ""Whenever a great deal of money is involved, there will be blood."" Take it as you like.Though Daniel Day-Lewis's performance has been widely praised, it is, to some degree, one-note ""Spock"" acting with little variation in tone. Worse, he sounds as if he's channeling Jack Palance. (Other people hear John Huston.) And when Paul Dano (in an otherwise fine performance) goes into a squeally fit, he sounds like Gene Wilder groveling in front of Zero Mostel. It's surprising the director failed to catch and fix these problems, which grow increasingly irritating.The cinematography is not irritating. ""There Will Be Blood"" is one of the best-photographed color films I've ever seen. I particularly like the way detail is retained in bright backgrounds, without burning them out. The music score is also exceptional, totally ""wrong"", yet absolutely perfect, even the use of a terrible performance of the Brahms violin concerto (Sophe-Mutter + HvK).One obvious question might be... Given the subject matter, is ""There Will Be Blood"" as good as ""Citizen Kane""? Nope, because the latter is (surprisingly) a far more audacious film. And Welles had the genius to add the ""Rosebud"" riddle, which keeps the audience interested.Given the highly positive critical response to ""There Will Be Blood"", you should read a review from a right-wing critic who not only detested the film, but utterly missed its obvious (and to be fair, heavy-handed) points. Amazon doesn't permit URLs, but go to the Wikipedia article for the film and click on footnote 31, to read Armond White's review.""There Will Be Blood"" would barely rank a PG rating, if it weren't for a brutal (though not particularly graphic) murder near the end.

1124563,A1QF10TB8AYTA3,B00104QSOM,"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja""","[0, 1]","Well, I was really hoping I was going to be rating this movie higher. But after having watched it in full, I have to say that I understand why people liked the movie, but I don't think it was worthy of such high praise.Again, this is coming from the guy who didn't like Citizen Kane, so take my review with a grain of salt if you loved that movie.This is essentially Citizen Kane once again, but in my opinion, the movie just dragged on and on. Yes, Daniel Day Lewis was fantastic. But Paul Dano? Ugh, what terrible acting. The music score was actually quite obnoxious in my opinion and there were times where I fell asleep during this movie because it was so boring.Structurally and thematically, this film should have worked for me. There was an interesting protagonist and an observation of how that character evolves and changes over time. But it just didn't register for me.I think part of the reason why I disliked this movie was a few things:1.) I couldn't really relate to the character of Daniel Plainsfield. I was entertained watching him, but I just didn't feel that deep emotional connection where I would have been affected by what happens to him. Yes the church scene had its moments, but ultimately it fell flat for me because I didn't really connect with any of the characters.2.) I also strongly disliked Paul Dano's character and was consistently confused. Was &#34;Paul&#34; really his brother or did Eli make him up and pretend to be his twin? I thought Paul Dano was a terrible actor and I hated everything about him. From his mannerisms, to his voice, to his charlatan ways, which probably leads me to the main reason I disliked this movie.3.) I have a very strong pet peeve about people impressing their religion on me. So to be subjected to a movie where you're constantly being forced to join a church or accept christ or do whatever. That immediately turns me off to the movie because it is something that I can relate to, and I hate it. In fact, I believe it is solely because of the Eli character, that I ended up disliking this movie as much as I did.4.) Quite frankly, I think the pacing was just too long, and that's another pet peeve of mine. Martin Scorcesse has this same problem where the pacing is just SO FREAKING LONG. 2001: Space Odyssey, again, why is the pacing so damn long? What is the purpose of making a shot go on and on forever. Is it supposed to show realism? Am I supposed to come to a revelation? Why pray tell, do I need to stare at that shot for 2 or 3 minutes when we could have cut away in 10 to 30 seconds.It doesn't make sense for it to take so long. It's like when they reveal the Enterprise in the 1st Star Trek movie. How long are we going to pan around a ship when we just want to get started with the space adventure.I wanted to see more Daniel Plainsfield, more Daniel Day Lewis. Instead, I had to wait around for long stretches of time and put up with an annoying character throughout the whole movie (Eli). Also, that musical score is awful. Sorry, it comes off as artsy and pretentious. I have a strong appreciation for classical music and even listen to some Opera from time to time. This soundtrack is a cacophony of violins trying to be passed off as music.Unfortunately this film wasn't my cup of tea, but don't let me stop you from watching it. I can see why people enjoyed it and understand why they rated it so highly in their reviews. I just happen to not agree with them.",2,There will be dislike.,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,3445,"['Well', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'rating', 'movie', 'higher', 'having', 'watched', 'full', 'have', 'say', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'liked', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'worthy', 'such', 'high', 'praise.Again', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'so', 'take', 'review', 'grain', 'salt', 'loved', 'movie.This', 'essentially', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'once', 'again', 'opinion', 'movie', 'just', 'dragged', 'Yes', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Ugh', 'what', 'terrible', 'acting', 'music', 'score', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'obnoxious', 'opinion', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'fell', 'asleep', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'boring.Structurally', 'thematically', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'worked', 'was', 'interesting', 'protagonist', 'observation', 'how', 'character', 'changes', 'time', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'register', 'me.I', 'think', 'part', 'reason', 'why', 'disliked', 'movie', 'was', 'few', 'things:1', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'relate', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Plainsfield', 'was', 'entertained', 'watching', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'deep', 'emotional', 'connection', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'affected', 'what', 'church', 'scene', 'had', 'moments', 'ultimately', 'fell', 'flat', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'connect', 'characters.2', 'also', 'strongly', 'disliked', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'character', 'was', 'consistently', 'confused', 'Was', '34', 'Paul', '34', 'really', 'brother', 'did', 'Eli', 'make', 'up', 'pretend', 'be', 'twin', 'thought', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'was', 'terrible', 'actor', 'hated', 'everything', 'mannerisms', 'voice', 'charlatan', 'ways', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'disliked', 'movie.3', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'pet', 'peeve', 'people', 'impressing', 'religion', 'So', 'be', 'subjected', 'movie', 'where', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'being', 'forced', 'join', 'church', 'accept', 'christ', 'do', 'immediately', 'movie', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'hate', 'fact', 'believe', 'solely', 'Eli', 'character', 'ended', 'up', 'disliking', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'did.4', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'think', 'pacing', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'Martin', 'Scorcesse', 'same', 'problem', 'where', 'pacing', 'just', 'SO', 'FREAKING', 'LONG', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'again', 'why', 'pacing', 'so', 'damn', 'long', 'What', 'purpose', 'making', 'shot', 'go', 'forever', 'supposed', 'show', 'realism', 'Am', 'supposed', 'come', 'revelation', 'Why', 'pray', 'tell', 'do', 'need', 'stare', 'shot', '2', '3', 'minutes', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'away', '10', '30', 'seconds.It', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'take', 'so', 'long', 'when', 'reveal', 'Enterprise', '1st', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'How', 'long', 'are', 'going', 'pan', 'around', 'ship', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'started', 'space', 'adventure.I', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Daniel', 'Plainsfield', 'more', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Instead', 'had', 'wait', 'around', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'put', 'up', 'annoying', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'Eli', 'Also', 'musical', 'score', 'awful', 'Sorry', 'off', 'artsy', 'pretentious', 'have', 'strong', 'appreciation', 'classical', 'music', 'even', 'listen', 'Opera', 'time', 'time', 'soundtrack', 'cacophony', 'violins', 'trying', 'be', 'passed', 'off', 'music.Unfortunately', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'watching', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'enjoyed', 'understand', 'why', 'rated', 'so', 'highly', 'reviews', 'just', 'happen', 'not', 'agree']",There Will Be Blood
1124564,A3Q9ZCPHHXYLWK,B00104QSOM,Windy City Dweller,"[1, 2]","Holy cow. That's all I can say after seeing this remarkably unsettling film. Long weaned on Hollywood stories that neatly package a story, here is a refreshing antidote to the Disney happy ending.Me, I like dark, muddy and oily, because that's human nature for you. This has literary grandeur, the images and the character of Daniel Plainview (Lewis) linger in one's mind. I loved how things weren't nicely explained - Plainview refuses to answer personal questions. We never really know about his childhood or history. And, I guess, I ask myself: &#34;Would we?&#34;Universal applause belongs to Daniel Day Lewis for his scrappy, frightening viper of an oil man, and rightly so. Plainview cloaks his sinister capitalism with polite howdee-doo's. He's the courtly type, the first to bow in a room, while all the while, summing up every person with black eyes that slice like razors. For me, Daniel Plainview is more insidious than Hannibal Lecter and Anton Chigurh. He's a businessman with zilch conscience, a tycoon antisocial who boasts he's &#34;a family man,&#34; so people will be reassured he's human.He'll sell you the elixir and siphon your soul, too. With ruthless glee, he strips the lands of resources and could care less how the people cope after he's packed his oil rigs and moved on. For him, evil is a core competency.Certainly there were glimpses of loneliness, even despair, in this Plainview character. When he embraces his adopted son, his affections seem tender, genuine. But other things speak to his callousness, how he fills the goat milk glass with hard liquor, and tips the glass so the child is force to drink it.Boy, I can't shake the guy. I keep hearing Lewis say, &#34;I'm an OIL MAN,&#34; in that John Houston style bombast. This is an acting masterpiece.What I longed for, was a worthwhile adversary, but I suppose that's the point... it's why robber barons ascended so high. They didn't have anyone trying to put on the brakes. They weren't really nice guys on the climb, they were out for profits. Maybe they could afford to be magnanimous once they had secured their - and their great-grandchildren's - fortunes.The pseudo-preacher, Eli, and Daniel Plainview, really competed for the same audiences, perhaps grudingly admiring each other's hawking abilities. Positioned as adversaries, I saw them I more alike than different. Their audiences, the desperately poor townspeople inhabiting these barren lands, were Barnum-scale suckers.Both were narcissists craving power. Eli was perhaps the bigger hypocrite, because he later bullies his father in a key scene, after Plainview brutally humiliates him, (by rubbing his head in gunky oil). Of course, we also learn that Eli's father beats his daughter, too. Whoever is bullied goes on to bully the even weaker.My own take, is that &#34;Paul,&#34; the brother who alerts Daniel to the untapped oil about 30 minutes into the film... the mystery brother, is really Eli himself. When he asks &#34;What about the oil?&#34; I assumed both &#34;brothers&#34; were the same guy.[spoiler alert] Late into the film, Eli returns. He's had success, but then succumbed to temptations (he reminds me of Aimee Semple McPherson). He's probably gambled or womanized or heaven knows what, but he makes himself vulnerable to Plainview, exposing his belly to the pit bull. Plainview loathes people in general, but cannot stomach timid, weak or wavering types, or anyone he perceives as disloyal to him, like his adult son.Visually, this is an arresting film, well-directed, too. The musical score is unusual, which I liked, (again, so many musical scores seem overly Hollywood-ed... the swell of music means I'm supposed to feel something, and instead I feel manipulated).Some of the movie was a little uneven... the pacing felt like it would slow to a stop and suddenly jolt forward... but other than that... it's terrific.",5,Riveting and Lewis is Fierce,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,3885,"['Holy', 'cow', 'can', 'say', 'seeing', 'remarkably', 'unsettling', 'film', 'Long', 'weaned', 'Hollywood', 'stories', 'neatly', 'package', 'story', 'here', 'refreshing', 'antidote', 'Disney', 'happy', 'ending.Me', 'like', 'dark', 'muddy', 'oily', 'human', 'nature', 'literary', 'grandeur', 'images', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Lewis', 'linger', 'one', 'mind', 'loved', 'how', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'nicely', 'explained', 'Plainview', 'answer', 'personal', 'questions', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'childhood', 'history', 'guess', 'ask', '34', 'Would', '34', 'Universal', 'applause', 'belongs', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'scrappy', 'frightening', 'viper', 'oil', 'man', 'rightly', 'so', 'Plainview', 'sinister', 'capitalism', 'polite', 'howdee-doo', 'courtly', 'type', 'first', 'bow', 'room', 'while', 'summing', 'up', 'person', 'black', 'eyes', 'slice', 'razors', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'more', 'insidious', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'businessman', 'zilch', 'conscience', 'tycoon', 'antisocial', 'who', '34', 'family', 'man', '34', 'so', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'reassured', 'human.He', ""'ll"", 'sell', 'elixir', 'siphon', 'soul', 'too', 'ruthless', 'glee', 'lands', 'resources', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'how', 'people', 'cope', 'packed', 'oil', 'rigs', 'moved', 'core', 'competency.Certainly', 'were', 'glimpses', 'loneliness', 'even', 'despair', 'Plainview', 'character', 'When', 'adopted', 'son', 'affections', 'seem', 'tender', 'genuine', 'other', 'things', 'speak', 'callousness', 'how', 'goat', 'milk', 'glass', 'hard', 'liquor', 'glass', 'child', 'force', 'drink', 'it.Boy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'guy', 'keep', 'hearing', 'Lewis', 'say', '34', ""'m"", 'OIL', 'MAN', '34', 'John', 'Houston', 'style', 'bombast', 'acting', 'masterpiece.What', 'longed', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'adversary', 'suppose', 'point', 'why', 'robber', 'barons', 'ascended', 'so', 'high', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anyone', 'trying', 'put', 'brakes', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'nice', 'guys', 'climb', 'were', 'out', 'profits', 'Maybe', 'could', 'afford', 'be', 'magnanimous', 'had', 'secured', 'great-grandchildren', 'fortunes.The', 'pseudo-preacher', 'Eli', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'really', 'competed', 'same', 'audiences', 'perhaps', 'grudingly', 'admiring', 'other', 'hawking', 'abilities', 'Positioned', 'adversaries', 'saw', 'more', 'alike', 'different', 'audiences', 'desperately', 'poor', 'townspeople', 'inhabiting', 'barren', 'lands', 'were', 'Barnum-scale', 'suckers.Both', 'were', 'narcissists', 'craving', 'power', 'Eli', 'was', 'perhaps', 'bigger', 'hypocrite', 'later', 'father', 'key', 'scene', 'Plainview', 'brutally', 'rubbing', 'head', 'gunky', 'oil', 'course', 'also', 'learn', 'Eli', 'father', 'daughter', 'too', 'Whoever', 'bullied', 'bully', 'even', 'weaker.My', 'own', 'take', '34', 'Paul', '34', 'brother', 'who', 'Daniel', 'untapped', 'oil', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'mystery', 'brother', 'really', 'Eli', 'When', '34', 'What', 'oil', '34', 'assumed', '34', 'brothers', '34', 'were', 'same', 'guy', 'spoiler', 'alert', ']', 'Late', 'film', 'Eli', 'returns', 'had', 'success', 'then', 'succumbed', 'temptations', 'Aimee', 'Semple', 'McPherson', 'probably', 'gambled', 'womanized', 'heaven', 'knows', 'what', 'vulnerable', 'Plainview', 'exposing', 'belly', 'pit', 'bull', 'Plainview', 'people', 'general', 'can', 'not', 'stomach', 'timid', 'weak', 'wavering', 'types', 'anyone', 'as', 'disloyal', 'adult', 'son.Visually', 'arresting', 'film', 'well-directed', 'too', 'musical', 'score', 'unusual', 'liked', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'musical', 'scores', 'seem', 'overly', 'Hollywood-ed', 'swell', 'music', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'something', 'instead', 'feel', 'manipulated', '.Some', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'felt', 'would', 'slow', 'stop', 'suddenly', 'forward', 'other', 'terrific']",There Will Be Blood

It is not often that I get mesmerised by a single actor's performance, but Daniel Day Lewis' performance in There Will Be Blood truly had me riveted from start to finish, not an easy feat given the movie's 2.5 hours length. It was an amazing performance filled with depth and emotion.There Will Be Blood traces the rise of Daniel Plainview, a miner who soon discovers more lucrative prospects in oil. He also finds himself adopting an orphaned infant boy whom he raises as his own. The boy, H.W. [played as a kid by Dillon Freasier] is 'used' to promote Plainview's own interests by picturing him as a wholesome, family-oriented man, despite the lack of a wife by his side. Plainview zealously goes about securing mineral lease rights and his fortunes take a turn for the better when a young man named Paul Sunday [Paul Dano] shows up in his office one day claiming to know the whereabouts of an oil-rich territory in exchange for a sum of money.So Daniel and his son go to Little Boston, CA and not only do they strike gold in the discovery of oil but it sets the stage for an enduring conflict between Plainview and Eli Sunday [Paul Dano again], an evangelist who tries to rival Plainview for the leadership of the community, but of course Plainview is having none of that - he doesn't like sharing anything.Paul Dano's performance as the overly-religious Eli Sunday is filled with a simmering fervour that releases itself into loud exhortations to God and yes, Plainview and I would say that these two actors, Day Lewis and Dano are the real reasons to watch this movie. Their conflict and animosity towards each other is apparent from the first time they meet and it only gets worse as time progresses.The story of There Will Be Blood is multi-faceted and complex and we see how Daniel's character evolves from a simple, hardworking miner and loving dad into a ruthless businessman who acts out in violence when he is crossed and spirals into self-destruction, losing him truly precious things along the way, such as friendship and most importantly his close bond with his adopted son.Powerful performances, a well-plotted storyline and masterful direction by Paul Thomas Anderson - a must-watch!",5,Electrifying!,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,2337,"['watched', 'movie', 'reading', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'ruthless', 'oilman', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'not', 'often', 'get', 'mesmerised', 'single', 'actor', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'performance', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'truly', 'had', 'riveted', 'start', 'finish', 'not', 'easy', 'feat', 'given', 'movie', '2.5', 'hours', 'length', 'was', 'amazing', 'performance', 'filled', 'depth', 'emotion.There', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'rise', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'miner', 'who', 'soon', 'more', 'lucrative', 'prospects', 'oil', 'also', 'adopting', 'orphaned', 'infant', 'boy', 'whom', 'own', 'boy', 'H.W', '[', 'played', 'kid', 'Dillon', 'Freasier', ']', ""'used"", 'promote', 'Plainview', 'own', 'interests', 'picturing', 'wholesome', 'family-oriented', 'man', 'lack', 'wife', 'side', 'Plainview', 'zealously', 'securing', 'mineral', 'lease', 'rights', 'fortunes', 'take', 'turn', 'better', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Paul', 'Sunday', '[', 'Paul', 'Dano', ']', 'up', 'office', 'one', 'day', 'claiming', 'know', 'whereabouts', 'oil-rich', 'territory', 'exchange', 'sum', 'money.So', 'Daniel', 'son', 'go', 'Little', 'Boston', 'CA', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'strike', 'gold', 'discovery', 'oil', 'stage', 'enduring', 'conflict', 'Plainview', 'Eli', 'Sunday', '[', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'again', ']', 'evangelist', 'who', 'rival', 'Plainview', 'leadership', 'community', 'course', 'Plainview', 'having', 'none', ""n't"", 'like', 'sharing', 'anything.Paul', 'Dano', 'performance', 'overly-religious', 'Eli', 'Sunday', 'filled', 'simmering', 'fervour', 'loud', 'exhortations', 'God', 'yes', 'Plainview', 'would', 'say', 'two', 'actors', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Dano', 'are', 'real', 'reasons', 'watch', 'movie', 'conflict', 'animosity', 'towards', 'other', 'apparent', 'first', 'time', 'meet', 'only', 'worse', 'time', 'progresses.The', 'story', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'multi-faceted', 'complex', 'see', 'how', 'Daniel', 'character', 'simple', 'hardworking', 'miner', 'loving', 'dad', 'ruthless', 'businessman', 'who', 'out', 'violence', 'when', 'crossed', 'spirals', 'self-destruction', 'losing', 'truly', 'precious', 'things', 'way', 'such', 'friendship', 'most', 'importantly', 'close', 'bond', 'adopted', 'son.Powerful', 'performances', 'well-plotted', 'storyline', 'masterful', 'direction', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'must-watch']",There Will Be Blood
