1236862,A3DQ4JHUSZTVVV,B001TM0HSI,Andre,"[5, 6]","I was so disappointed with Skull and Bones! The premise sounds brilliant and original, however the execution could not be more run of the mill if it tried.a lot has been said of the script, and especially the repetition of certain lines, I'm not sure that that wasn't done with a purpose, the film is however so condescending of the viewer that I didn't really care what the directors comment on society was. It's also rather pointless to make a B grade trash film (in the vein of the great John Waters) and then to make it as insipid as possible. John Waters had balls and he nailed them to the wall for all to see in his earlier work, something which is essential for this genre to work, what we have here is a sad imitation.I would suggest staying away, however if your anything like me, you're gonna buy it anyway and hope for the best.",1,believe the negativity,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,840,"['was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'Skull', 'Bones', 'premise', 'brilliant', 'original', 'however', 'execution', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'run', 'mill', 'lot', 'been', 'said', 'script', 'especially', 'repetition', 'certain', 'lines', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'purpose', 'film', 'however', 'so', 'condescending', 'viewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'directors', 'comment', 'society', 'was', 'also', 'rather', 'pointless', 'make', 'B', 'grade', 'trash', 'film', 'vein', 'great', 'John', 'Waters', 'then', 'make', 'as', 'insipid', 'possible', 'John', 'Waters', 'had', 'balls', 'nailed', 'wall', 'see', 'earlier', 'work', 'something', 'essential', 'genre', 'work', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'sad', 'imitation.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'staying', 'away', 'however', 'anything', ""'re"", 'gon', 'buy', 'anyway', 'hope', 'best']",Skull & Bones
