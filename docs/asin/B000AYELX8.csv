935321,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000AYELX8,Andres C. Salama,"[2, 2]","This excellent Italian comedy is very similar in plot to Mean Girls (who came out on theaters in about the same time). The difference is that this is a much more politicized film. Caterina is a shy teenager from a small town in Italy, who moves to Rome with her long-suffering mother and her teacher father, when he is assigned to a new job there. In her new school, she has to choose to what clique to belong: the children of the progressive intellectuals or the children of the rich industrialists. The left or the right. What this film says is that these people are not terribly different between themselves. They both hold a degree of fame and power in Italian society, and look down upon those who don't. The outstanding performance in the movie is that of Caterina's father, the teacher Giancarlo (Sergio Castellito), a hothead angry that others have gotten all the breaks in life, who rants against the rich and privileged but who would sell his soul in a second in order to join the establishment. He is a familiar type of malcontent in real life but one who is seldom shown in the movies. There is a silly subplot of Caterina falling in love with an Australian boy, but all in all, this is one of the best Italian movies of the last years.",5,"Excellent italian comedy, with serious undertones",1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,1248,"['excellent', 'Italian', 'comedy', 'very', 'similar', 'plot', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'who', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'same', 'time', 'difference', 'much', 'more', 'politicized', 'film', 'Caterina', 'shy', 'teenager', 'small', 'town', 'Italy', 'who', 'Rome', 'long-suffering', 'mother', 'teacher', 'father', 'when', 'assigned', 'new', 'job', 'there', 'new', 'school', 'choose', 'what', 'clique', 'belong', 'children', 'progressive', 'intellectuals', 'children', 'rich', 'industrialists', 'left', 'right', 'What', 'film', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'different', 'hold', 'degree', 'fame', 'power', 'Italian', 'society', 'look', 'down', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'outstanding', 'performance', 'movie', 'Caterina', 'father', 'teacher', 'Giancarlo', 'Sergio', 'Castellito', 'hothead', 'angry', 'others', 'have', 'gotten', 'breaks', 'life', 'who', 'rich', 'privileged', 'who', 'would', 'sell', 'soul', 'second', 'order', 'join', 'establishment', 'familiar', 'type', 'malcontent', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'who', 'seldom', 'shown', 'movies', 'silly', 'subplot', 'Caterina', 'falling', 'love', 'Australian', 'boy', 'one', 'best', 'Italian', 'movies', 'last', 'years']",Caterina in the Big City

Times and was pleasantly surprised to find it on the shelf at our public library. What a pleasant surprise.This is a coming-of-age film about a 13 year-old girl who moves from a small and remote Italian town to the ultra-sophisticated world of Rome. Think ""Mean Girls"", with a touch of Amy Heckerly's ""Clueless"". But ""Catarina"" rises above the usual teen farce by integrating Catarina and her classmates into the {corrupt}adult world around them. The fine editorial review above is an excellent summary of the story and I will not try to duplicte it.As the Times' reviewer pointed out, ""Catarina"" shows how we now have a global youth culture. The girls of Roma are easily recognized as variants on American teens, with their own clothes, issues, etc.Alice Tergil is superb as the sweet, but naive, newcomer.

935324,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AYELX8,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","'Caterina va in citta' ('Caterina in the Big City') is an Italian film that takes as its storyline the coming of age of a young teenager transported by her family from the quiet Tuscany seaside village of Montaldo Di Castro to the challenging realities of Big City Rome, but that is only the means to an end of exploring Italian politico-social life and its effects on the youth of today.  It comes very close to drowning in its own excesses, but at the root of the film is a sensitive tale of a young girl's struggles with growing into an adulthood that puzzles, frightens and challenges her.Caterina (Alice Teghil) finds her greatest moments of happiness in her home town singing mezzo soprano in the choir: simple pleasures in a simple setting surrounded by country folk content to live life day to day.  Her father Giancarlo (Sergio Castellitto) is a teacher who can't hold a job, partially because he is so outspoken and partially because he is a raving truly obnoxious person.  Her mother Agata (Margherita Buy) is subservient, a woman with few coping mechanisms who allows her odious husband to run an abusive household.  Giancarlo's aunt is ill in Rome and with the idea of finding a job where his talents are respected, Giancarlo uproots his little family and moves to the big city.  There the social castes are evident and Caterina is judged a country hick until she is befriended by first a rebel who bonds with Caterina, introduces her to tattoos and liquor, and causes a schism between her important mother (Giancarlo hoped to have is novel published by the woman), the daughter and his family.  Caterina then is absorbed into the rich and spoiled rank and file of the wealthy, not fitting in until the girls do a make over. That situation is again disrupted by Giancarlo's blindly inappropriate behavior. The true Caterina is somehow lost, still dreaming of becoming a fine mezzo soprano, but tagging along with the crowd du jour.  Ultimately Giancarlo's multiple and consistent failures drive him away from the family, he rides off to oblivion on his restored motorbike,  and Agata and Caterina both bloom.The noise level of this film is such that it is difficult to watch: the young girls means of communication is a mixture of screaming, loud talking, and fighting and otherwise making us uncomfortable.  Yet underneath all of the political and social expose and brandishing is a truly wonderful young Caterina whose life as a soap opera is watched tenderly by an Australian boy who plays the guitar and observes her family from a window across the way from Caterina's Rome home.  The moments toward the end of the film when the playback comes justifies the fuss of getting there.This is not a film this viewer would sit through again, but reflecting on the story after all the commotion is over, hearing Mozart's 'Ave Verum Corpus' and Verdi's 'Nabucco"" etc as the inspiration behind Caterina's honest dreams, makes is a more memorable experience.
