1234589,A1U2IMZ2HM6ABF,B001RXDM2M,De witte leeuw.,"[0, 0]","I like TV mini-series because they are not heavy drama, although I must admit that this is a rather ""bloodless"" version.  But there are detials that just won't fly after having read the book and seen the 1997 film version ""Robinson Crusoe"" (Pierce Brosnan).  First and foremost [1] this Robinson always has a clean fresh shirt to wear every day, no rags after six years on a deserted island, yet in the original story and the 1997 movie based upon it, Robinson's clothes were reduced to rags and he was forced to make clothing from animal skins. [2] His abode in the book was a cave surrounded by a high stockade fence.  In this series he lives in a tree-house that is almost identical to Disney's film ""Swiss Family Robinson"" (1960). [3] Friday's character in this version or series presents him as a highly-education man (as in Oxford University), no tattoos, or bones, and hair that any civilized barbershop would create with a regular haircut.  In the book and the 1997 film he is presented as intended by Defoe, i.e., a savage tribesman who eventually speaks in broken English, has long hair, tattoos, and even a bone in his nose. [4] In the book and the 1997 film the island they live on is visited only by a cannibalistic tribe who use it as a place of human sacrifice. Yet in this TV series, there are pirates, Spanish pirate-hunters, cannibals, an insane English castaway, mad wild dogs, women, mutineers, and even members of his family come from England to kill him. But .... despite all these inaccuracies, the writers have written several plots and strung these together in such a way that it is enjoyable to watch, even fun. The flashbacks are annoying but necessary because this series does not follow the book 85% of the time.  The scenery is breathtaking, the acting good, and the period details, i.e., weapons, clothing, ships, etc. very well done.  I will say this in conclusion, if I didn't really like it, I would not have watched the entire series three times in less than two weeks.

The first thing I noticed was how much the lead actor (Crusoe) resembled a youngSean Bean (one of my favorite actors) and lo and behold, Sean Bean does a wonderful job as Crusoe's father, which made the resemblance wonderful.  Another thing I enjoyed was the obvious enjoyment that Crusoe and Friday got out of their roles, they were having fun and it showed. They also seemed to have a good raport between them, as real friends would.  The villans were suitable, the sub plots convoluted enough to keep you guessing, and overall, the acting was good.  Gripes?  Not too many.  Sometimes Crusoe's island seemed to resemble Gilligan's, with all the comings and goings, but you wouldn't have had as much of a story otherwise.  And the fact that when I ordered the series, I also got a unwanted copy of DeFoe's book.

1234598,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B001RXDM2M,Mark Baker,"[5, 6]","Robinson Crusoe (Philip Winchester) has had a hard life.  Picking the wrong side of the insurrection against the King of England, he had to flee to the colonies for his life, leaving his wife Susannah (Anna Walton) and their kids in the hands of trusted family friend Jeremiah Blackthorn (Sam Neill).  But then fate deals him an even worse hand when he is shipwreck on a deserted island with only Friday (Tongai Arnold Chirisa) as a companion.  Together, the two build a friendship while fighting to survive on the island among pirates, natives, and nature.But back in England, things aren't all they seem.  In a series of flashes, we learn Crusoe's back story and what is currently happening to those he loves in England.  If Crusoe and Friday ever get off the island, what will be waiting for them in England?I'll admit I've never read the original novel, but I had to tune in to this modern day take on the classic story.  Now what do I mean by modern day take?  While the story is set in the late 1700's, some of the attitudes are modern.  Most noticeably, I seriously doubt that the Crusoe of the novel treats Friday as his equal the way he does here.  Do I mind the more modern sensibilities?  Not in the slightest.  In fact, the strong bond between Crusoe and Friday is one of the reasons I kept tuning in.Honestly, the show struggled a little in the beginning to capture my interest.  I'd watch an episode, enjoy it, but often forget when it was coming back.  Thanks to my DVR, I caught them all.  As the series grew, things developed into a tight unit that really made the wait between the last few episodes hard.  While the ending wasn't what I hoped it would be, it did leave me satisfied and willing to imagine my own ending for the characters.The show was incredible to look at.  Everything was lavishly constructed to recreate the time period.  England looked amazing.  And the island was so much fun.  The tree house alone made me smile each week.  And we can't leave out all the inventions that Crusoe and Friday had.  Okay, so it stretched credibility a little, but it was fun.The acting was great here as well.  In fact, it was one thing that kept me coming back to the series.I'm still unclear whether this was really intended to be a limited series or not, but these 13 episodes are well worth getting to enjoy over and over again.",4,It Grew Into Solid Entertainment,1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,2351,"['Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'Philip', 'Winchester', 'had', 'hard', 'life', 'Picking', 'wrong', 'side', 'insurrection', 'King', 'England', 'had', 'flee', 'colonies', 'life', 'leaving', 'wife', 'Susannah', 'Anna', 'Walton', 'kids', 'hands', 'trusted', 'family', 'friend', 'Jeremiah', 'Blackthorn', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'then', 'fate', 'deals', 'even', 'worse', 'hand', 'when', 'shipwreck', 'deserted', 'island', 'only', 'Friday', 'Tongai', 'Arnold', 'Chirisa', 'companion', 'Together', 'two', 'build', 'friendship', 'fighting', 'survive', 'island', 'pirates', 'natives', 'nature.But', 'back', 'England', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'seem', 'series', 'flashes', 'learn', 'Crusoe', 'back', 'story', 'what', 'currently', 'happening', 'England', 'Crusoe', 'Friday', 'ever', 'get', 'off', 'island', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'waiting', 'England', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'original', 'novel', 'had', 'tune', 'modern', 'day', 'take', 'classic', 'story', 'Now', 'what', 'do', 'mean', 'modern', 'day', 'take', 'story', 'set', 'late', '1700', 'attitudes', 'are', 'modern', 'Most', 'noticeably', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'Crusoe', 'novel', 'treats', 'Friday', 'equal', 'way', 'here', 'Do', 'mind', 'more', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'Not', 'slightest', 'fact', 'strong', 'bond', 'Crusoe', 'Friday', 'one', 'reasons', 'kept', 'tuning', 'in.Honestly', 'show', 'struggled', 'little', 'beginning', 'capture', 'interest', ""'d"", 'watch', 'episode', 'enjoy', 'often', 'forget', 'when', 'was', 'coming', 'back', 'Thanks', 'DVR', 'caught', 'series', 'grew', 'things', 'developed', 'tight', 'unit', 'really', 'made', 'wait', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'hard', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'did', 'leave', 'satisfied', 'willing', 'imagine', 'own', 'ending', 'characters.The', 'show', 'was', 'incredible', 'look', 'Everything', 'was', 'lavishly', 'constructed', 'recreate', 'time', 'period', 'England', 'looked', 'amazing', 'island', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'tree', 'house', 'alone', 'made', 'smile', 'week', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'inventions', 'Crusoe', 'Friday', 'had', 'Okay', 'stretched', 'credibility', 'little', 'was', 'fun.The', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'kept', 'coming', 'back', 'series.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'unclear', 'was', 'really', 'intended', 'be', 'limited', 'series', 'not', '13', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'getting', 'enjoy', 'over', 'again']",Crusoe: The Complete Series

Philip Winchester(""Flyboys"") and Tongai Arnold Chirisa are two of the most handsomest, physically cut as well as good actors to play Crusoe and Friday that you'll ever see.  Sam Neill plays well the mysterious yet suspiciously oily, benefactor and powerful overlord of Crusoe's past and probably his future.There's humor and drama, tons of swashbuckling adventure and even romance all shot in gorgeous surroundings of jungle, endless beach(where's my ticket, I'm going!), with all types of peril to savor.  And they take haven in the coolest of treehouses.The story jumps mostly between lost island and 17th century England as the ever inventive Crusoe and his family long for each other while both are under the threat of sinister forces.  The episodes for the most part run together, and when they don't, it's less interesting.  Outside of Friday, the women in Crusoe's noble though a bit naive life are the most interesting characters.Finally, for those worried about the culmination of the story since the series was not extended, and even though I would, of course, love to see more ""Crusoe"", I feel that the ending provided does tie up fairly well the story in a wistfully and fateful way.

That helped. Also, once you get over the ridiculous aspects -- he's still wearing clothes from his ship 6 years later and they look new -- the stories themselves were not so bad.

Other reviewers have gone over the plot, and described the fantastic scenes and the marvels of their tree house all of which are so true...but it is also a wonderful story of believing in the one you love no matter what happens. It is fast-paced, pulse-racing action and so very beautiful and tender at the same time. We certainly need a sequel, a movie, or a trilogy to tie up the cliff-hanger ending!!!!
