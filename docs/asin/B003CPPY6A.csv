I usually don't like direct-to-video sequels that piggyback onto more successful films by association, but I was pleasantly distracted by WILD THINGS: FOURSOMEA cast of virtually unknown pretty boys and pretty girls make up the cast. The acting is good, which is to say that the screenwriters were smart enough not to strain the actors' abilities with anything too demanding. The storyline follows the overall concept of the originalWild Things. It's a kill-or-be-klled fest of backstabbings, betrayals, rip-offs, lies, and misdirection.WILD THINGS: FOURSOME was made in sunny South Florida. In what amounts to a continuity problem, it takes place either in the fictional city of ""Blue Bay"" or in Miami. Never mind the contrivance, it's upscale Miami, impure and unsimple.Surprisingly enough, the plot holds up really well through its numerous twists and turns. Carson Wheetley, rich and young and handsome, scion of NASCAR hero Ted Wheetley, hates his father who may have killed his mother. Carson has a hot girlfriend. Actually, he has three hot girlfriends, and they hatch a plot to kill Daddy Wheetley and divvy up his money. Shortly thereafter, Daddy Wheetley dies during a race, and the cops get involved. Daddy Wheetley's lawyer suddenly announces that Carson can't inherit until he marries. He marries one hot girlfriend, Rachel, and inherits. Carson and Rachel decide to kill the other girls and keep all the money. Rachel and the other girls decide to kill Carson so Rachel the grieving widow can inherit. The other girls decide to kill Carson and then kill Rachel. And so on. Nobody has clean hands in WILD THINGS: FOURSOME.Full of bikini babes, cigarette boats, makeout scenes, cocaine, sapphic erotica, fast cars, tanning oil, bare breasts, and views from the private islands in Biscayne Bay, WILD THINGS: FOURSOME is not exactly memorable, but it's worth an enjoyable 90 minutes of your time under the mango tree.",4,Miami vice,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,1979,"['was', 'prepared', 'not', 'like', 'WILD', 'THINGS', '4', 'FOURSOME', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'direct-to-video', 'sequels', 'piggyback', 'more', 'successful', 'films', 'association', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'distracted', 'WILD', 'THINGS', 'FOURSOMEA', 'cast', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'pretty', 'boys', 'pretty', 'girls', 'make', 'up', 'cast', 'acting', 'good', 'say', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'not', 'strain', 'actors', 'abilities', 'anything', 'too', 'demanding', 'storyline', 'overall', 'concept', 'originalWild', 'Things', 'kill-or-be-klled', 'fest', 'backstabbings', 'betrayals', 'rip-offs', 'lies', 'misdirection.WILD', 'THINGS', 'FOURSOME', 'was', 'made', 'sunny', 'South', 'Florida', 'what', 'amounts', 'continuity', 'problem', 'place', 'either', 'fictional', 'city', 'Blue', 'Bay', 'Miami', 'Never', 'mind', 'contrivance', 'upscale', 'Miami', 'impure', 'unsimple.Surprisingly', 'enough', 'plot', 'up', 'really', 'well', 'numerous', 'twists', 'turns', 'Carson', 'Wheetley', 'rich', 'young', 'handsome', 'scion', 'NASCAR', 'hero', 'Ted', 'Wheetley', 'father', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'mother', 'Carson', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'Actually', 'three', 'hot', 'girlfriends', 'hatch', 'plot', 'kill', 'Daddy', 'Wheetley', 'divvy', 'up', 'money', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'Daddy', 'Wheetley', 'race', 'cops', 'get', 'involved', 'Daddy', 'Wheetley', 'lawyer', 'suddenly', 'Carson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'inherit', 'one', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'inherits', 'Carson', 'Rachel', 'decide', 'kill', 'other', 'girls', 'keep', 'money', 'Rachel', 'other', 'girls', 'decide', 'kill', 'Carson', 'so', 'Rachel', 'grieving', 'widow', 'can', 'inherit', 'other', 'girls', 'decide', 'kill', 'Carson', 'then', 'kill', 'Rachel', 'so', 'Nobody', 'clean', 'hands', 'WILD', 'THINGS', 'FOURSOME.Full', 'bikini', 'babes', 'cigarette', 'boats', 'makeout', 'scenes', 'cocaine', 'sapphic', 'erotica', 'fast', 'cars', 'tanning', 'oil', 'bare', 'breasts', 'views', 'private', 'islands', 'Biscayne', 'Bay', 'WILD', 'THINGS', 'FOURSOME', 'not', 'exactly', 'memorable', 'enjoyable', '90', 'minutes', 'time', 'mango', 'tree']",Wild Things: Foursome
