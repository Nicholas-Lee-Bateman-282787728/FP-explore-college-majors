1073390,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B000Q66PXE,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[365, 392]","THE SERIESRome wasn't built in one day, we all know that and its story can't be told over 2 seasons but this is probably the best we're going to have, audio-visually, for a long time to come. This is an interrupted, extremely ambitious and, eventually, unaffordable HBO project meant to illustrate the process though which an up and coming but flawed - expansionist, aristocrat driven, slave labor dependent - republic morphs into an equally or more so flawed, unsustainable empire. [Hmmm... lessons to learn? Anyone? Anyone?]HBO and the producers of the show should be commended for doing everything in their power to stay as close as artistically possible to the historical record, whatever was available, of the period - and 'Rome' covers Cesar's climb to power and the period shortly thereafter, up to Octavian's triumph and transformation into 'Augustus' - the struggles, the intrigue, the atrocities - and how the events it triggered affected the aristocrats and the plebes, rich and poor, citizens, free men and slaves. The point of view and the storytelling shifts or swings between the history makers - Cesar, his family, Octavian, the aristocrats opposing Cesar - and two more or less ordinary Forrest Gump-like Roman soldiers who find themselves involved with almost everything historians wrote about those years and are also depicted during their more ordinary moments.'Rome' is a feast to the eye, at least in the Blu-ray version that I'm watching. The colors are vibrant and the details on ornaments, wall graffiti, costumes, makeup are as accurate as they come. I would say almost the same about the sounds of Rome but we know so much less about the music of antiquity... Due to obvious budget constraints, camera angles are almost always narrow, focusing on specific buildings or people with the occasional, probably CGI-produced, panoramic shots. And no large, uber-expensive battle scenes but that's okay because the overall story is told well. I don't believe we ever see more than a few dozen humans on any scene but we should admire the director and the camera people even more for their ability to maintain our suspension of disbelief with the limited means at their disposal. Having some of the scenes shot on location - 'Rome' was made in Italy at the Cinecita studios - makes watching even more enjoyable.THE BLU-RAY EDITIONThe Blu-ray edition excels in every aspect, from packaging to the quality of the actual episodes to the Blu-ray specific extras.The two season's 22 episodes of about one hour each are delivered on 10 discs. They come inside an amazingly beautiful book-like binding with each disc on its own 2-page presentation/display that consists of one picture on the left page and some details on each of the episodes on that specific disc on the right-side page which also holds the disc. There are additional pages that contain titles or some artwork for a total of 30, thick cardboard, full color pages. It's nice that a cloth bookmark was added to help keep track of where one may be with the viewing. The box the book slides in is color-coordinated with the book covers - dark, weathered dried-blood reddish-brown with gold lettering and accents. Simply amazing.Each episode is presented in 1080p, 16:9 screen and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround sound for English and German as well as DTS Digital Surround 2.0 for Spanish, French, Castilian and Polish (voice over). Subtitles are available in dozens on languages.Blu-ray specific extras include the invaluable ""All Roads Lead to Rome"" - a historian presents the historical fact as the episodes run, a 'must watch' when 'Rome' is viewed the second time around because the abundance of information would make watching it the first time too distracting. Also Blu-ray specific is 'Bloodlines', another interactive guide that shows and helps us understand the connections between the various Roman families.In addition, 13 of the 22 episodes come with audio commentary alternative sound tracks from the cast and crew - presumably to be listened to on the third watching of the series. There are also a number of the usual 'behind the scenes' and 'how did we make this' featurettes.MY RATINGNot surprisingly, I will rate 'Rome' as a 5-star. It's not perfect but it doesn't need to be so to earn its stars - Amazon's five stars mean 'I love it' not 'it's perfect'. And I absolutely love it. In fact, I am going through the second watching now - the one with 'All Roads Lead to Rome' turned on - and I love 'Rome' even more.My only issue is that which earned 'Rome' its MA (mature audiences) rating. I am quite frustrated for not being able to watch 'Rome' with my kids in the same room. I know that some would call it 'butchery' but Blu-ray technology should allow for a 'cleaned', PG-13 version that kids could watch too because I can see how watching a show like this, especially with the historical interactive guide turned on, would make some curious enough to actually read more on the topic.___________________________________________________FAIR WARNINGAnyone considering watching 'Rome' in a 'family' setting should be aware that the show is rated TV MA and for good reason. 'Rome' attempts to accurately depict the Rome of 2000 years ago where sexual inhibitions were all but absent, most women were viewed as 'property' and slaves were numerous. You WILL see explicit sex, frontal male nudity and covering your kids eyes won't be enough - consider earplugs or frequent use of the 'mute' button because the sounds of sex are even more explicit than the images. Besides engaging in sex largely for amusement, violence was part of the Roman way of life - torture, gladiator and other arena fights, assassinations were common. Well... those were the Romans - love them or hate them.",5,'Rome' raises the bar for history-inspired TV shows,1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,5775,"['SERIESRome', 'was', ""n't"", 'built', 'one', 'day',

1073394,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000Q66PXE,Andres C. Salama,"[1, 2]","HBO's Rome two seasons (originally shown in the years 2005-2007) covers in twenty two episodes the twenty two year period between the battle of Alesia in 52 BC and the aftermath to the battle of Actium in 30 BC (Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC is shown at the end of the first season and the beginning of the second season). While several plot threads runs through the series, basically the first season is about how Caesar rose to hold absolute power (defeating rivals like Pompey) just before being murdered, while the second season tell us how after Caesar's death, a struggle began between Octavian (later emperor Augustus) and Mark Antony to fill the existent power void generated.The series is centered round the lives of two friends and comrades from the campaign in Gaul, the hot tempered Vorenus (played by Kevin McKidd, who looks a lot like Daniel Craig) and the more amiable Pullo (played by Ray Stevenson, who looks a bit like Mel Gibson and another bit like Russell Crowe) They both existed historically (two centurions bearing those names are mentioned in Caesar's Commentaries on the War in Gaul), but little else is known about them, so most of what is shown in the TV series is invented. The rest of the cast is mostly British, none of them very famous (most of them come from a BBC high drama/theatrical background) but they mostly acquit themselves fine: James Purefoy particularly excels as the slimy, edgy Mark Antony; David Bamber is a fine Cicero, so is Polly Walker as the scheming matron Attia. Tobias Menzies is also good as the well intentioned but politically nave Brutus, the gorgeous Kerry Condon impresses as the young, promiscuous Octavia, while Ciaran Hinds is good in his understated, dignified performance as Julius Caesar.With the obvious exception of having the Romans speak in English (there is always something ridiculous about movies where Romans deliver obscenities in a Cockney accent) real care was taken by the filmmakers to make this series as historically accurate as possible.The production values are considerable. Still, since they didn't have an enormous budget, the filmmakers decided not to film huge crowd scenes, concentrating instead on smaller, more intimate scenes. Thus Mark Antony's funeral oration of Caesar is referred to but not shown, and with the exception of the battle of Philippi none of the other battles of the era is recreated. Despite this smaller scope, this miniseries represents a considerable achievement, a triumph both of popular and intelligent entertainment and scholarship.As a nice extra, the DVD features some very good information about different aspects of Ancient Rome to help us understand the series and the era more.",5,Superb,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,2711,"['HBO', 'Rome', 'two', 'seasons', 'originally', 'shown', 'years', '2005-2007', 'covers', 'twenty', 'two', 'twenty', 'two', 'year', 'period', 'battle', 'Alesia', '52', 'BC', 'aftermath', 'battle', 'Actium', '30', 'BC', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'assassination', '44', 'BC', 'shown', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'beginning', 'second', 'season', 'several', 'plot', 'threads', 'series', 'basically', 'first', 'season', 'how', 'Caesar', 'rose', 'hold', 'absolute', 'power', 'defeating', 'rivals', 'Pompey', 'just', 'being', 'murdered', 'second', 'season', 'tell', 'how', 'Caesar', 'death', 'struggle', 'began', 'Octavian', 'later', 'emperor', 'Augustus', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'fill', 'existent', 'power', 'generated.The', 'series', 'centered', 'lives', 'two', 'friends', 'comrades', 'campaign', 'Gaul', 'hot', 'tempered', 'Vorenus', 'played', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'who', 'lot', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'more', 'amiable', 'Pullo', 'played', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'bit', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'bit', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'existed', 'historically', 'two', 'centurions', 'bearing', 'names', 'are', 'mentioned', 'Caesar', 'Commentaries', 'War', 'Gaul', 'little', 'else', 'known', 'so', 'most', 'what', 'shown', 'TV', 'series', 'invented', 'rest', 'cast', 'mostly', 'British', 'none', 'very', 'famous', 'most', 'come', 'BBC', 'high', 'drama/theatrical', 'background', 'mostly', 'acquit', 'fine', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'particularly', 'excels', 'slimy', 'edgy', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'David', 'Bamber', 'fine', 'Cicero', 'so', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'scheming', 'matron', 'Attia', 'Tobias', 'Menzies', 'also', 'good', 'well', 'intentioned', 'politically', 'nave', 'Brutus', 'gorgeous', 'Kerry', 'Condon', 'young', 'promiscuous', 'Octavia', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'good', 'understated', 'dignified', 'performance', 'Julius', 'Caesar.With', 'obvious', 'exception', 'having', 'Romans', 'speak', 'English', 'always', 'something', 'ridiculous', 'movies', 'where', 'Romans', 'deliver', 'obscenities', 'Cockney', 'accent', 'real', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'series', 'historically', 'accurate', 'possible.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'considerable', 'Still', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enormous', 'budget', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'not', 'film', 'huge', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'concentrating', 'instead', 'smaller', 'more', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'Thus', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'funeral', 'oration', 'Caesar', 'referred', 'not', 'shown', 'exception', 'battle', 'Philippi', 'none', 'other', 'battles', 'era', 'recreated', 'smaller', 'scope', 'considerable', 'achievement', 'triumph', 'popular', 'intelligent', 'entertainment', 'scholarship.As', 'nice', 'extra', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'information', 'different', 'aspects', 'Ancient', 'Rome', 'help', 'understand', 'series', 'era', 'more']",Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons

1073402,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000Q66PXE,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 5]","The HBO / BBC TV series Rome, in two seasons, covers the behind the scenes events of the Roman Civil War. Act I brought Julius Caesar to power as dictator for life of the Republic, only to be assassinated on the senate floor. Act II is the alliance of Caesar's appointed heir, Octavian, with Caesar's former general and loyal ally, Mark Antony to defeat Pompey Maximus and the Senators. Act Three is when Mark Antony travels to his eastern half of the empire, becomes the lover of Cleopatra, and is finally defeated by Octavian and Marcus Agrippa.The obvious comparison of this series is with the famed series, I Claudius, which played on Masterpiece Theatre. The two series meld together perfectly, since Rome ends shortly after the battle of Actium, and I, Claudius opens with the celebration, 7 years later, of the victory at Actium by Augustus (nee Octavian), his wife Olivia, his daughter and son in law, and Marcus Agrippa. I, Claudius covers a period of unprecedented peace, often called Pax Augustus. ""Rome"" covers a period of almost constant civil war.Another big difference is that there are at least three intertwined circles where the action take place. The first is in the politics of the leaders, Caesar, Antony, Cicero, Cato, Pompey, Brutus, and Octavian. The second is between the houses of Caesar's niece, Atia of the Julii, and mother to Octavian versus Servilia, Caesar's lover, and mother of Marcus Brutus, one of Caesar's assassins. The third is in the lives of two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus, a centurion (lieutenant) and Titus Pullo, a legionnaire (private) in Caesar's elite 13th legion. These two men are actually mentioned in Caesar's books on the Gallic wars, but just barely mentioned, giving their characters a slim basis in history. Their lives weave in and out of the lives of the major players cited above. The most important connection is forged when ""retired"" legionnaire Pullo is hired by Atia to teach young Octavian how to fight. The two close friends set the scene in season one for the season two climax when they accompany Caesar to Alexandria and succeed in sneaking the ""exiled"" Cleopatra into the camp of Caesar, whereby Caesar deposes her younger brother and places her on the throne of Egypt.What may surprise us is what is missing. This history has been covered by both the greatest playwrights (Shakespeare, ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Antony and Cleopatra"" and George Bernard Shaw's ""Caesar and Cleopatra"", plus the Hollywood extravaganzas such as Burton and Taylor's ""Cleopatra"") Thus, we immediately miss the famous oration (I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him...) which Shakespeare puts into the mouth of Mark Antony, which is credited with turning the people against the assassins. There is also virtually no large scale combat. All the great battles of the Civil war, including the spectacular naval battle at Actium (shown in the film ""Cleopatra"") all happens in the background.The writers claim they have aimed less for historical accuracy than for ""authenticity"". I suspect they have been very successful in achieving that effect. This is not the Rome of ""Cleopatra"" or ""Gladiator"" or even ""The Robe"" and ""Ben-Hur"". This is a dirty city where the populace was always one step away from starvation if any  twist of the civil war interrupted the grain shipments from Egypt. The streets seem to be ruled by ""collegia"", which appears to our eyes as an exact replica of Mafia families, run by graft, extortion, and murder. Except that their ""product"" was not primarily drugs, gambling, and prostitution (although there was lots of that to go around). It was primarily the staples of life, grain, olive oil, wine, and pork. Sometimes these collegia worked with the government, and sometimes they didn't.One dreadfully realistic aspect of ancient Roman politics is that political assassination was accepted as simply one of many tools for doing business. This is another way in which the ancient Roman government seems to have been run like the Corleone family in ""The Godfather"".A big similarity between ""Rome"" and ""I, Claudius"" was the presence of slaves at every level, even at the highest. Caesar's most trusted advisor was a slave, probably Greek, named Posca. He plays a key role at several turn, yet the pamphlet of principle characters is so full, they don't even list him. This highlights one of the weaknesses in the overall structure of the series. There are so many minor and intermediate characters, it is hard to keep them all straight, especially Atia, Servilia, and their households. Oddly enough, even second ranked male characters such as Cato, Cicero, Timon, and Pompey are easier to tell apart by both dress and manner. I found that the underlying source of antagonism between the two principle women was never really brought out. One is unsure whether the primary reason is sexual or political. There may be one or two side stories, such as the fortunes of Atia's Jewish mercenary, who is urged to join his older brother to assassinate Herod the Great when he comes to court favor with the new triumvirate, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus.  Lepidus is another unfortunate loose end, but the writers are stuck with him, since he was a loose end in the actual history of the Civil War.These may interwoven threads with their loose ends is the one area where ""Rome"" suffers most in comparison to ""I, Claudius"". Another is in the quality of the acting and directing. ""I, Claudius"" had several important, recognizable actors such as John Hurt, Sian Phillips, Patrick Stewart, John Rhys-Davies, Derek Jacobi, and Brian Blessed. Most of ""Rome"" actors are unfamiliar to us, although the four most important parts, Ciarin Hinds as Caesar, James Purefoy as Mark Antony,  Kevin McKidd as Vorenus, and Ray Stevenson as Pullo carry off their roles quite well, especially Stevenson, who may actually be familiar to American viewers for his roles in American movies such as ""The Book of Eli"" and ""King Arthur"".In case you didn't notice the content rating, this series would easily rate an R rating if it were shown in theatres. Every episode has one or more soft core porn scenes. To be sure, sexual passions were one of the driving motivations for the characters, especially Mark Antony and the two lead women, but one does get the sense that these scenes are added as eye candy and less for their dramatic importance. One almost prefers ""I, Claudius"", with its one very short scene, and ambitions driven by power, to the testosterone drenched atmosphere of ""Rome"".""Rome"" is very high quality entertainment. If I were to give ""I, Claudius"" an A, ""Rome"" would get a ""B+"".",5,The Roman Civil War in Battlefield and Bedroom,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,6620,"['HBO', '/', 'BBC', 'TV', 'series', 'Rome',

Knapp ""gpk""","[11, 26]","I had not seen any parts of the series when I ordered it, and the reviews are generally positive, albeit mixed, so I was curious about the project. The first season starts out with an adventure of the two fictional indestructible, fairly flat supermacho heroes, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, who pretty much hold center stage through the whole series. Historical events and characters are all too often overshadowed or supplanted by the fictional characters and their intrigues and (mis)deeds, in particular the two scheming and multi-layered superwomen Atia and Servilia. Needless to say, historical license abounds from beginning to end. Historical characters (Julius Caesar, Augustus, Cicero, Pompeius, Brutus, Cassius et al.) occasionally show some profile, sporadically even a bit of depth, but are by far not explored in their full potential. After all, Roman historiography has a wealth of source texts that could have been studied to provide deeper insight into these characters, their motivations and the impact of their actions and omissions on Roman history. We do get insights into the lives of the impoverished, but much of the focus is on the criminal underworld. Scriptwriting is very uneven and ranges from fair to abominable. The formulaic ingredients of copious (often brutal) sex and violence, blood and gore, suspense and soap are strategically placed and can become annoying or at least tedious.  Battle scenes are mostly abbreviated or filmically alluded to, perhaps for the better. But the fates of the thousands of unknown soldiers and bystanders who died for the greed and power hunger of their rulers are pretty much left in the dark. I had high hopes that the second season, produced by HBO in association with BBC, might show at least some aspirations to historical accuracy (not to mention good taste), but on the average it turns out to be of lesser quality than the first. Cleopatra is shown as a mindless, drug-addicted slut, her entourage, including the debauched Marcus Antonius, as a grotesque menagerie of creepy beings: all this can hardly reflect a small degree of historical accuracy. - The filmic realization (setting, props, locale, action, makeup, costumes etc.) appears to strive for some kind of Hollywood ""neo-realism"", distinctly (and thankfully) different from the sanitized creakers of yore &agrave; la ""Cleopatra"" (1963) and such, but somehow not quite credible in terms of a convincing realization of what might have been. The viewer is constantly aware that this is not the real ancient Rome, as it emerges from the historical texts, but a fantasy place created by and visualized through the lens of present-day filmmakers. All in all, this is at times entertaining, at times suspenseful and at times annoying fare which would have greatly benefited from a good team of scriptwriters, capable historical advisors and a much stronger accent on the representation of the ""grand"" historical narrative. As it stands, one is not too surprised that the project folded after two seasons, probably due to a lack of appeal to both the more sophisticated and the more basic audiences: there is not that much middle ground between these groups. In good conscience, I can not give it more than two stars.",2,"too much action, way too little history",1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,3245,"['had', 'not', 'seen', 'parts', 'series', 'when', 'ordered', 'reviews', 'are', 'generally', 'positive', 'mixed', 'was', 'curious', 'project', 'first', 'season', 'out', 'adventure', 'two', 'fictional', 'indestructible', 'fairly', 'flat', 'supermacho', 'heroes', 'Lucius', 'Vorenus', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'hold', 'center', 'stage', 'whole', 'series', 'Historical', 'events', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'overshadowed', 'supplanted', 'fictional', 'characters', 'intrigues', 'mis', 'deeds', 'particular', 'two', 'scheming', 'multi-layered', 'superwomen', 'Atia', 'Servilia', 'Needless', 'say', 'historical', 'license', 'abounds', 'beginning', 'end', 'Historical', 'characters', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Augustus', 'Cicero', 'Pompeius', 'Brutus', 'Cassius', 'al', 'occasionally', 'show', 'profile', 'sporadically', 'even', 'bit', 'depth', 'are', 'far', 'not', 'explored', 'full', 'potential', 'Roman', 'historiography', 'wealth', 'source', 'texts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'studied', 'provide', 'deeper', 'insight', 'characters', 'motivations', 'impact', 'actions', 'omissions', 'Roman', 'history', 'do', 'get', 'insights', 'lives', 'impoverished', 'much', 'focus', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'Scriptwriting', 'very', 'uneven', 'fair', 'abominable', 'formulaic', 'ingredients', 'copious', 'often', 'brutal', 'sex', 'violence', 'blood', 'gore', 'suspense', 'soap', 'are', 'strategically', 'placed', 'can', 'become', 'annoying', 'least', 'tedious', 'Battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'abbreviated', 'filmically', 'alluded', 'perhaps', 'better', 'fates', 'thousands', 'unknown', 'soldiers', 'bystanders', 'who', 'died', 'greed', 'power', 'hunger', 'rulers', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'left', 'dark', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'second', 'season', 'produced', 'HBO', 'association', 'BBC', 'might', 'show', 'least', 'aspirations', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'not', 'mention', 'good', 'taste', 'average', 'out', 'be', 'lesser', 'quality', 'first', 'Cleopatra', 'shown', 'mindless', 'drug-addicted', 'slut', 'entourage', 'including', 'debauched', 'Marcus', 'Antonius', 'grotesque', 'menagerie', 'creepy', 'beings', 'can', 'hardly', 'reflect', 'small', 'degree', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'filmic', 'realization', 'setting', 'props', 'locale', 'action', 'makeup', 'etc', 'strive', 'kind', 'Hollywood', 'neo-realism', 'distinctly', 'thankfully', 'different', 'sanitized', 'creakers', 'yore', 'agrave', 'Cleopatra', '1963', 'such', 'somehow', 'not', 'quite', 'credible', 'terms', 'convincing', 'realization', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'aware', 'not', 'real', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'historical', 'texts', 'fantasy', 'place', 'created', 'visualized', 'lens', 'present-day', 'filmmakers', 'times', 'entertaining', 'times', 'suspenseful', 'times', 'annoying', 'fare', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'benefited', 'good', 'team', 'scriptwriters', 'capable', 'historical', 'advisors', 'much', 'stronger', 'accent', 'representation', 'grand', 'historical', 'narrative', 'one', 'not', 'too', 'surprised', 'project', 'folded', 'two', 'seasons', 'probably', 'due', 'lack', 'appeal', 'both', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'more', 'basic', 'audiences', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'middle', 'ground', 'groups', 'good', 'conscience', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'more', 'two', 'stars']",Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons

Second time with the ""All Roads Lead To Rome"" feature on, which gives historical bits in relation to what's going on in the series.  Seeing it with that is a good excuse to watch it twice, though I wouldn't recommend it the first time.And I would not have guessed Roman history could be so utterly consuming.  I kind of shied away from it for a while with bad memories of lit class Shakespeare plays I'd had to read in college in mind.  Not that those are not worth reading in their own right and I'd probably find a lot more to enjoy in those had I seen this series first.  What makes the series so strong though, is its subplots which are as engaging as the main historical events that take place.  It's as if through these subplots one comes to feel they really understand what was going on behind the scenes of the Roman history we are already somewhat familiar with.  These subplots and the characters in them really bring to full life the main events that go down.As it's HBO, it's got all the sex and violence you'd expect from an HBO special. It's also got all the fine touches of detail and camera work that add such vibrant reality to a story making it a real work of art, one that often speaks volumes without words.Beyond the lush cinematography, elaborate film sets and Italian location settings that make it easy to see how big the budget for this production must have been, you've got an excellent and incredible choice of actors in the cast.  There are just so many memorable and likable characters aptly realized in ""Rome"" that it is hard to choose a favorite: Pullo and Vorenus, Atia and Servilia, Julius Caesar, Marc Anthony, Cleopatra and Octavian...What I like about the way the story is told is that the English is largely colloquial, which makes the scene and story all the more immediate, intimate and relatable. Not surprisingly though I read somewhere this show intitially didn't go down real well in Italy.  Well, the Queen's English and the cultural vibe it creates are obviously quite a bit different than the language of Italy and it's culture.  Irregardless, the BBC and HBO probably are as qualified as Shakespeare was when he first put these histories into the theatre.  The world of HBOs Rome is very convincing for what it sets out to do - tell an ancient story on somewhat modern terms - and has had me interested in all things 'ancient Rome' since seeing it.  There was talk at some point of the show going 5 seasons, but unfortunately it was condensed into just two finally due to the budget involved. A pity that, yet there is news of a big-screen sequel in the works which is supposed to pick up in Germany just 4 years after the series ended. Will be looking forward to that!

This is one of the four essential Blu-Ray series releases that will ensure that the great unwashed public will FINALLY invest in Blu-Ray players.  We still await two of these seemingly made-for-Blu-Ray series -- we are still patiently waiting for Indiana Jones and Star Wars, but at least the Harry Potter series is being released in a timely (and most entertaining) fashion.  And Rome is the fourth.If any of you who actually have working brains have not yet seen Rome, I suggest that you do so forthwith.  It is, to state it quite bluntly and unequivocally, the very best television show ever made by anyone throughout the entire history of the medium.  Indeed, if you use a scale of zero-to-ten, and you give Rome a ten, the second-best television show ever produced will score no better than a six.It excels on all levels.  The part that pertains to historical events is factual and illuminating.  The parts that are historical fiction are contextually accurate and rivitingly engaging.  The characters are compelling and become your friends and foes.  The stories are thrilling, edge-of-your-seat nailbiters.  The acting is worthy of the very best of the legitimate stage.  The cinematography is rich and flawless, every scene just as you would wish your eyes to view it.  The sets are utterly exquisite, stunning, glorious.  The costumes actually serve in an active way to enhance the viewing experience.  And to add a delightful frosting to an already incredibly delicious cake, you get to see the gorgeous, voluptuous English actress Polly Walker (among others) running around naked a lot (or, for you girls and alternative lifestyle sorts, you get a good view of James Purefoy).The only thing to criticize about this show is that it was canceled too soon.  It leaves us craving so much more.  While the wonderful PBS production of ""I, Claudius"" (the show that would have gotten the rating of six that I mentioned above) pretty much picks up where ""Rome"" left off, historically speaking, they could have gone on to do Nero into Vespasian in the same style the following year and provided just as compelling a story, and then gone on right through the rest of the Flavians, the Antonines, and the fall of the Western empire in subsequent seasons.

1073432,A38L1FZNX9MU0X,B000Q66PXE,Harold A. Fretheim,"[5, 5]","This series was the finest show ever created for television. It does the best job of recreating pre-christian Rome that could have possibly been done within the constraints of television or film. In fact, I am not the first to say that if you really want to see the impact that Christianity made on the world then watch Rome to find out what the world was like before it.  And I am saying this as someone who has read very extensively about Rome and this time period- and had five and a half years of Latin in school, which included having to translate Ceasar's Gallic Wars. So one of the things that I really liked about this series was the attempt to really show us what Roman life and politics was about.On the other hand, because of budget constraints, the series was cut short- it properly should have lasted at least three years and instead ended after a shortened second season. The final episodes attempt to summarize what happened on the way to Octavain becoming the sole Emperor of Rome. That is why you will probably find the first season more satisfying dramatically than the second.While the broad outlines of history are honored that this series is not totally accurate.  As an example: One of the main female characters in this series is Atia- the mother of Octavian. She is pictured as living though all of the events up until Octavian becomes Emperor of Rome. The real Atia died before Octavian reached his twentieth birthday. But this is a quibble- what Atia's character shows us is the influence of women in this period of history- Roman women were utterly powerless yet also extremely influential.  So the history is not totally accurate, but the characters go a long way towaqrds showing us the realities of the time.  That is why I think of this series as not a history but a portrait.  The great drama of the time plays out in a way that lets us see the character of the people rather than just a depiction of events.",5,A GREAT PORTRAIT OF ROME,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,1940,"['series', 'was', 'finest', 'show', 'ever', 'created', 'television', 'best', 'job', 'recreating', 'pre-christian', 'Rome', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'done', 'constraints', 'television', 'film', 'fact', 'am', 'not', 'first', 'say', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'impact', 'Christianity', 'made', 'world', 'then', 'watch', 'Rome', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'world', 'was', 'am', 'saying', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'very', 'extensively', 'Rome', 'time', 'period-', 'had', 'five', 'half', 'years', 'Latin', 'school', 'included', 'having', 'translate', 'Ceasar', 'Gallic', 'Wars', 'So', 'one', 'things', 'really', 'liked', 'series', 'was', 'attempt', 'really', 'show', 'Roman', 'life', 'politics', 'was', 'other', 'hand', 'budget', 'constraints', 'series', 'was', 'cut', 'short-', 'properly', 'should', 'have', 'lasted', 'least', 'three', 'years', 'instead', 'ended', 'shortened', 'second', 'season', 'final', 'episodes', 'attempt', 'summarize', 'what', 'happened', 'way', 'Octavain', 'becoming', 'sole', 'Emperor', 'Rome', 'why', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'first', 'season', 'more', 'satisfying', 'dramatically', 'second.While', 'broad', 'outlines', 'history', 'are', 'honored', 'series', 'not', 'totally', 'accurate', 'example', 'One', 'main', 'female', 'characters', 'series', 'Atia-', 'mother', 'Octavian', 'pictured', 'living', 'events', 'up', 'Octavian', 'becomes', 'Emperor', 'Rome', 'real', 'Atia', 'died', 'Octavian', 'reached', 'twentieth', 'birthday', 'quibble-', 'what', 'Atia', 'character', 'influence', 'women', 'period', 'history-', 'Roman', 'women', 'were', 'utterly', 'powerless', 'yet', 'also', 'extremely', 'influential', 'history', 'not', 'totally', 'accurate', 'characters', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'towaqrds', 'showing', 'realities', 'time', 'why', 'think', 'series', 'not', 'history', 'portrait', 'great', 'drama', 'time', 'out', 'way', 'see', 'character', 'people', 'rather', 'just', 'depiction', 'events']",Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons

As far as I could tell, that is all there basically was to the entire story. The tale meandered hither, thither and yon and I waited in vain for the real point to the story, for the real climax, but the only climax I saw were the ones achieved by the Roman characters on the screen.  The story line had no real defined point and, for hours on end over 11 CD&#8217;s,  just ambled and meandered from one incident to another, heartthrob to heartthrob, with no real reason or point to the story. At times, it was difficult to follow what was going on with some of the scenarios which I felt were injected perhaps as fillers from time to time to flesh out the allotted time, punctuated by crude sex, full nudity and foul language.  Yes, in human life, all these things are certainly a reality, but when one pays some $50 plus another $6.00 shipping and handling, I expected at least a story of some worth to accompany all this murder, nudity, flesh and desire. Alas, but this was not to be.While it more or less held my interest, the story dragged on and on, slowly, never achieving any point in particular, jumping from one incident to another, and then suddenly ended as the bodies of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra were paraded by on a cart while the Romans looked on.  I was left with the feeling, &#8220;I watched all these hours and it ends like this? Did the camera suddenly run out of film?&#8221;For those who enjoy the daily soap operas, with sex, cheating, nudity and so on ad nauseum, then Rome is for you.  However, please note there certainly isn&#8217;t much of a story to it and definitely not worth fifty bucks.",3,A Super Soap Opera,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,2644,"['Five', 'stars', 'set', 'costuming', 'buildings', 'movie', 'were', 'superb', 'can', 'readily', 'see', 'vast', 'expense', 'producers', 'directors', 'went', 'filming', 'Rome', 'spared', 'expense', 'spared', 'detail', 'can', 'say', 'had', 'what', 'set', 'movie', 'cost', 'checking', 'account', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'happy', 'camper', 'critiques', 'read', 'movie', 'raved', 'thus', 'prompted', 'purchase', 'entire', 'series', 'My', 'wife', 'watched', 'together', 'period', 'several', 'days.And', 'were', 'quite', 'disappointed.I', 'gave', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'only', 'costuming', 'sets', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'had', 'expected', 'see', 'story', 'Roman', 'people', 'perhaps', 'covering', 'several', 'generations', 'something', 'akin', '8220', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'Roman', 'Empire', '8221', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'instead', 'watched', 'X-rated', 'soap', 'opera', 'rife', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'treachery', 'betrayal', 'coarse', 'profanity', 'brutal', 'violence', 'graphic', 'sometimes', 'brutal', 'sex', 'stated', 'editorial', 'review', 'As', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'basically', 'was', 'entire', 'story', 'tale', 'meandered', 'hither', 'thither', 'yon', 'waited', 'vain', 'real', 'point', 'story', 'real', 'climax', 'only', 'climax', 'saw', 'were', 'ones', 'achieved', 'Roman', 'characters', 'screen', 'story', 'line', 'had', 'real', 'defined', 'point', 'hours', 'end', '11', 'CD', '8217', 'just', 'ambled', 'meandered', 'one', 'incident', 'heartthrob', 'heartthrob', 'real', 'reason', 'point', 'story', 'times', 'was', 'difficult', 'follow', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'scenarios', 'felt', 'were', 'injected', 'perhaps', 'fillers', 'time', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'allotted', 'time', 'punctuated', 'crude', 'sex', 'full', 'nudity', 'foul', 'language', 'Yes', 'human', 'life', 'things', 'are', 'certainly', 'reality', 'when', 'one', '50', '6.00', 'shipping', 'handling', 'expected', 'least', 'story', 'worth', 'accompany', 'murder', 'nudity', 'flesh', 'desire', 'Alas', 'was', 'not', 'be.While', 'more', 'less', 'held', 'interest', 'story', 'dragged', 'slowly', 'never', 'achieving', 'point', 'particular', 'jumping', 'one', 'incident', 'then', 'suddenly', 'ended', 'bodies', 'Mark', 'Anthony', 'Cleopatra', 'were', 'paraded', 'cart', 'Romans', 'looked', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', '8220', 'watched', 'hours', 'camera', 'suddenly', 'film', '8221', 'who', 'enjoy', 'daily', 'soap', 'operas', 'sex', 'cheating', 'nudity', 'so', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'then', 'Rome', 'However', 'please', 'note', 'certainly', 'isn', '8217', 'much', 'story', 'definitely', 'not', 'worth', 'fifty', 'bucks']",Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons

1073440,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000Q66PXE,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","The two seasons are simple as for the divide between the two. The first season is the rise of Caesar from the conquest of Gaul to the consulship in Rome against the will of the nobles and patricians of the republic who wanted him eliminated from politics. Then he gets into the game, conquers Rome itself, the Senate and becomes the first autocratic ruler, hence the first emperor or a preview of what it was going to be. He had to defeat Pompey, the leader of the Senate who fled to Greece.But he is assassinated by many patrician senators in the senate, the fatal and last blow coming from Brutus, the one he had defined as his trusted friend and spiritual son. Yet he must have known there was something wrong in that Brutus, especially when he refused to accept the governorship of Macedonia not to be sent away from Rome, since in his will he made Gaius Octavian, a nephew of his, his legal and sole heir.The second season is the rise of the adoptive son of Caesar, his nephew Gaius Octavian, the future Emperor Augustus. This young man helps Mark Anthony, the surviving associate of Caesar, to negotiate the status quo and a general amnesty with the leader of the Senate Cicero and the patricians there. This compromise keeps Mark Antony in his position as consul, but Gaius Octavian manipulates the patricians and this leads to the sending of Brutus away from Rome, and later on with the downgrading of Mark Antony who has to escape with his own, legions north. Gaius Octavian then negotiates an alliance with Mark Antony against Brutus who is announced as marching on Rome. Brutus is defeated and Mark Antony will have to accept his exile to Egypt and Cleopatra, which will mean his end, defeated by Gaius Octavian, in fact defeated by his orgiastic love affair.Note the two seasons correspond to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Anthony and Cleopatra.The republic of Rome is finally dead and the Empire has taken over with one sole leader.The history behind the series is rather simple. But what is original is of course the tremendous art displayed in the series to depict Rome at the time realistically.First, we enter the family businesses and strives of these patricians who will bring the republic down and instate the empire just because of their personal ambitions and hostilities cannot find any peace and coexistence. At times the series is gross by realistically showing how women in this world are playing the plotting game better than any one else, among themselves, against one another or against men.Second this is a slave state and slavery is everywhere. A free man or woman can kill a slave at will, if it is his or hers, and only with some financial consequences if it is someone else's: a sort of compensation for the loss of property, damages for the property damage. It is also shown how a personal slave is supposed to follow his or her master or mistress in death when death comes: the slave very often will help his or her master or mistress to die when time has come, and then will kill herself or himself on the dead body, otherwise he or she will be killed by the first intervening official, and surely in some refined torture. We are given one example of the torturing of a slave that is conducted by the woman this slave was supposed to kill, and he failed, and he will only be put to death out of his misery when he will have told the name of the woman who paid him to do it.We often forget that the majority of the working population was composed of slaves, to the point of causing some problems with the free laborers of Rome who were unemployed or under-employed, which means  they had problem just plainly surviving because of this ""unfair"" competition.Third the series insists on the sexual dimension of this society. Sex was part of this world and was always more or less public: less when only slaves could witness it; more when sex was performed in front of everyone in any occasion, in an orgy, in a brothel, or plainly in the street or at home at times in some celebration. The question of orientation is not over emphasized, I mean gay sex, though there are a few cases to make it clear that orientation was not a question that could divide people. Sex was sex. Sex was not love. Sex was exclusively entertaining. And slaves had no right to object against any kind of sexual action with them. Any free man or woman could take any slave sexually in anyway they wanted.Fourth the next element I will emphasize is the extreme violence and the common spill of blood in any action. Fighting to one's death, killing to survive in any kind of public execution when a man was thrown into some arena against trained gladiators was common place. Assassination for a profit or to eliminate a rival or competitor was also part of the Roman game, and that was a game, a bloody social game. Have things changed today? For sure they have but not as much as one could think.Fifth the series insists on the extreme level of superstition and religious bigotry, if not sorcery, at all levels of society. To kill, even in temples, was common place and if human sacrifice was no longer possible per se, though it was more than frequent to throw a criminal of any type, or a slave for any reason whatsoever, into a pit to be dismembered or whatever the whims of the gladiators down there would caress and entertain. Emasculation and rape were common place, both sexes in the case of rape. Capturing your enemies or the family of yours enemies, or the friends of your enemies and selling them as slaves was common place too. The various types of slaves are put on display constantly: personal valets or chambermaids, kitchen slaves, field slaves, but also sex slaves (for personal use), mining slaves (hard labor), prostitution (open and financially profitable slavery), all kinds of productive work from crafts to commerce, and then whatever entertaining activity a slave could be submitted to in an orgy, in a circus, in the street, out of a whim or some perverse desire. Most entertainments had to do with bringing one or several people to their unnatural death in some cruel display. The death of Vercingetorix is one case that is demonstrated in length, and his final execution will be in the Forum as part of the public celebration of Caesar's victory, part of Caesar's triumph. The strangest category of slaves are private counselors for the powerful. This reveals that slavery is in a way a trusted position accepted by the salves as normal fate and exploited by the slave-owner, at times with a lot of trust and even love; Caesar's private counselors was a slave and he was freed in Caesar's will.Sixth the last element is the role the Aventine in Rome, the harbor and wholesale commercial center of Rome for imports essentially (corn particularly). It is in the hands of some independent and mostly violent corporations that have a lot to do with what we would consider today as the mafia. It is an essential stake for the Senate, for the Emperor later. They could block imports and thus famish the city, create an artificial famine. That's probably one of the essential segments of society that made the Roman Empire powerful. These corporations were difficult to govern but extremely powerful in a rather primitive market economy in a metropolis that had no direct surrounding environment that could sustain its economy and its population. It had to have an independent and powerful social organization that could guarantee the flow of imports. Octavian was particularly menaced by conflicts among them (both among the corporations themselves and between Octavian and the corporations) that brought starvation if not famine.For all these reasons this series should be a favorite of people who like realistic non-cosmeticized history.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Pungent and tasty history,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,7791,"['two', 'seasons', 'are',

I just came across it on HBOGO and I thought it looked interesting.  Interesting is an understatement.  It is fascinating.  So many aspects of this show are just the best I've ever seen.  Such as the scenery.  They literally recreated ancient Rome.  The costumes are excellent as well.  But the thing that puts it over the top is the acting.  Every single actor in this show is amazing.  Especially the two main actors, that play Verinus and Pullo (sp?).  And I love how the story is told through these two men's eyes.  They could have just done a straight-forward history lesson. Everyone knows the story of Ceasar. It would have been good, I'm sure, but they chose to tell it from a different perspective.  It is so interesting to see how the common people lived in that time.  All we ever hear about are the wealthy men who ran everything.  So to see it, using common soldiers, truly makes this one of the best series about ancient Rome that I've ever seen.

We did some research on a few subjects that interested us, and found that on the whole, the series was accurate.

1073449,A126JVOAOOR42V,B000Q66PXE,John McConnell,"[1, 2]","A friend recommended this series, stating ""you can't stop watching"". Like the book that keeps you up all night reading, this HBO series of Julius and Augustus Caesar captures your interest.Howbeit, the series has serious shortcomings. It doesn't hold up to repeated viewing. Second, the colloquial British diction detracts from the action if you aren't British. Third, the domestic problems of Lucius Vorenus are insipidly melodramatic and tiresome. A fourth shortcoming is the abusive Forrest Gump theme: two simple Roman soldiers (Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo) repeatedly appear at crucial moments in Roman history and unwittingly exert immense influence: (eg, ""How Titus Pullo Brought Down the Roman Republic"", etc). While these two characters are very believable as portrayed, their deus ex machina appearances throughout twenty years of Roman history simply are not believable and are improvidently overdone. Such fusion of zany black humor with otherwise serious history *could* impart charm, but the humor is so overdone that it contaminates by dramatic osmosis other scenes that demand a serious tone. (Imagine Saving Private Ryan peppered throughout with brief snippets of McHale's Navy, or recall Jar Jar Binks in George Lucas's Star Wars prequels.)On the plus side is the graphic portrayal of pre-Christian pagan values: These are hard people without sentiment for whom sudden death and chronic mayhem are daily occurrences taken in stride. One might meaningfully say they are spiritually dead people. Whether ancient Romans really were this scorpion-like and amoral is problematic, of course, but it's certainly refreshing to see a genuine attempt to depict an ancient culture *without* modern Humanist/Christian values.The casting, overall, is superb. The characters are lifelike depictions consonant with Plutarch's Lives, Shakespeare's plays, and the historical record generally. Although Julius Caesar obviously is whitewashed into near-sainthood, you nevertheless can imagine you really are encountering the great man's spirit through the inspired acting of Ciaran Hinds. David Bamber as Cicero and James Purefoy as Mark Antony are doubly superb.Again, while I don't feel Rome holds up to repeated viewing, this series is pretty amazing nonetheless.

It came as two series and I would have loved a lot more, just for the joy of watching. The individual episodes have separate directors and often rather different flavors (some better than others). I felt that all of the episodes depicting Cleopatra and her Roman lovers (Caesar and Mark Antony) were rather weak but otherwise every episode is enjoyable. There are two layers to the story. One is the ruling stratum and the other two soldiers: Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, who find their lives intertwined with key historical events. The latter eventually became the stronger of the layers and the writers seemed to find Vorenus and Pullo the easier material. Throughout the two series the standard of acting is just superb and I would say that the cast is better than the story. Often the storyline is broken and discontinuous and major events (such as the murder of Caesar) are skirted around and left unseen. The increasing role of Vorenus and Pullo becomes increasing farcical as the series moves to a slightly anticlimactical ending. There are acres of nudity, sex and violence which becomes a little tiresome and is used as a filler to avoid meaningful dialogue. Mostly filmed in Italy apparently for reasons of historical accuracy with lots of Italian extras. Overall, I would say it is very enjoyable, good acting, great production (lighting, scenes, wardrobe, etc) mixed writing (good and bad), moderate believability, storyline often weak/broken. One is left with a good insight into the morality of Ancient Rome. My advice is to buy and enjoy. Best time to watch: late at night.

1073468,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B000Q66PXE,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[54, 70]","The ingredients do not necessarily suggest a successful TV-series. There's extreme, relentless, at times mind numbing violence, graphically depicted; barely a single sympathetic character is in sight; there is not the slightest hint of anything humoristic (well, except for Ian McNeices delicious newsreader); and as always actual historical fact is twisted and turned into something that may be suitable for entertainment purposes but rather (over)stretches credulity at times - one wonders why, because it's not as if these people actually were a dull bunch leading uneventful lives. Yet ""Rome"" is strangely haunting and compelling. Often it does a good job of transporting the viewer to a world unencumbered by Christian sensitivities, particularly in its love of bloodsports, its dealings with slaves, and its relaxed attitude to sex and public nudity. Full frontal male nudity is not eschewed, still the final frontier in film-making. Also, and more importantly, ""Rome"" conveys the constant sense of tension, intrigue and threat dominating the lives of those in power. Finally, a fairly good job was done of giving a realistic impression of the city itself in those final decades before the birth of Christ. It is, however, weird and rather silly that the characters speak English but throw in occasional Latin. The perfect, smudge-free make-up and excellent teeth also make you wonder (Suetonius describes Octavian's teeth as ""few, small and decayed"").Typically, many of the main dramatic historical events are not shown, but only told in flashback. For instance, we do not witness Mark Antony's finest hour, his eulogy at Caesar's funeral, that swayed Roman public opinion against the assassins. Several decisive battles, including that of Actium, are also conveniently skipped.The story is told from the vantage point of two soldiers, one eventually rising through the ranks, the other only finding a settled existence towards the end. Both are, though in name only, based on historical characters. Gruff and dutiful Lucius Vorenus is haunted by personal tragedy. He struggles with his role as a father and his allegiance to a loosing party, that of Mark Antony; struggles that at one point will land him as the leader of a band of hired assassins. His unlikely friend Titus Pullo leads an aimless existence that never manages to be carefree and that only gains some focus whenever some fighting is to be done. The plot has been constructed around the far-out premise that the whole birth of the Roman Empire pivoted on the actions of these two men, rather than those of Julius Caesar and his ilk. The idea has been woven into the story so tightly and cleverly that it is surprisingly easy to suspend disbelief.The first season is the more consistent and compelling of the two, dealing with the battle between Julius Caesar and Magnus Pompey. The strife between the families of Caesar and Brutus is exemplified by their two matrons Atia and Servilia, both in their way as vicious and devious a schemer as you're ever likely to see. The development of the relationship between Vorenus and Niobe is believable and quite touching.The second season then depicts the power struggle between Mark Antony and Gaius Octavian, and introduces the exotic element of Egypt, where Cleopatra's court appears to be some kind of whorehouse and the Queen herself a scantily dressed upmarket prostitute. Halfway through this season the story start to get ragged, and some plotlines hang by a precariously thin thread (the way Vorenus discovers his daughter's betrayal is like something out of an uninspired Miss Marple episode). A Jewish subplot is randomly tacked on and feels like a cumbersome invention to burden the story with irrelevant premonitions of Christ. Furthermore, it doesn't help that a substantial number of  the more interesting characters, notably Cicero, Servilia and Brutus, are killed off. The ""Xena, Warrior Princess""- act of Gaia in the battle of the Collegia is probably the low point of the series. Fortunately, things are pulled together for the final episodes, where the story is satisfyingly wrapped up and the viewer is indeed left, in Octavian's words, with the sense of having travelled a long road.History buffs will find ample cause to be annoyed nonetheless. Many events are fabricated, characters are missing (where are Octavia's husband Claudius Marcellus, Atia's husband Lucius Phillippus and Marc Anthony's wife Fulvia?), people weren't really in the places where we see them at the moment we see them there (Caesar wasn't killed in the Senate, Cicero wasn't killed at home), and several details of costume and ritual are anachronistic or invented. Alexandria is shown as some rustic backwater rather than the dazzling metropolis it was.Characters are sometimes almost insultingly distorted. Cicero wasn't the abject hypocrite and coward he's been made into by the makers of the series. He delivered the Philippics against Antony himself, and was a figure of great power and huge popularity. Atia gets even worse treatment: described by Tacitus as one of the most admired and devout matrons of Rome, who couldn't bear crude language and was deeply serious, she is turned into a foul-mouthed, violent she-devil.Generally speaking it is a pity that most of the characters are rather flat and stereotyped. It sometime makes it hard to believe when they do change, as when the cynical libertine Mark Antony suddenly waxes philosophical after loosing the battle of Actium. Easily the most complex, fascinating and moving character in the series is that of Brutus, played with consummate skill and total conviction by Tobias Menzies. It is a great pity that the scriptwriters did not retain for him his dignified suicidal death, but instead have him madly confront an entire legion on his own, and die a death mirroring that of Caesar - the symbolism is very trite.Such concerns may seem academic, but in this TV-dominated age its only too likely that many will think that after watching ""Rome"" they actually know something of Roman history. Not so - but they will have been splendidly entertained.",4,"Compelling, dark entertainment, though not very accurate",1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,6119,"['ingredients', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily',

1073470,ADY2T3QG6YSHF,B000Q66PXE,Michael A. Weyer,"[32, 33]","First off, if you do have the first two season sets of ""Rome"" on DVD already, no real reason to upgrade. The extras are all the same with no changes and the picture, if a bit sharper, is about the same too.But if you haven't gotten this series, this is a great way to start. This is Ancient Rome the HBO way, which means amazing detail to history while mixing in contemporary language, scattered with curses, bloody violence and (this is Rome, after all), constant nudity. The story revolves around two soldiers, Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and Pullo (Ray Stevenson) who find themselves involved in the dramatic events of Rome. From Julius Ceasar crossing the Rubicon and becoming emperor to meeting Cleopatra, Ceasar's death and the war between Octavius and Rome, the two are in the midst of it all while handling thier own personal dramas. In the first season, Vorenus has no idea his wife had a child with another man while he was at war while Pullo's hard-drinking and violent ways get him into trouble.The acting is terrific from the two leads, McKidd cool most of the time, which makes his bursts of incredible violence more notable. Pullo is funny as a man who'd go straight through anyone in his parth and sees no trouble killing. Ciaran Hinds gives Caesar a proud air that makes you understand why people were willing to follow him while James Purefoy plays Marc Antony as an arrogant blowhard who still manages to power his way through the ruling class. The best of the cast, however, is easily Polly Walker as the deliciously wicked Atia, a woman willing to do anything (Blackmail, murder and use her body however she wants) to get ahead in Roman society.The show is wonderfully researched, bringing the era to life like never before and showcases some nice bits of history. The language may be contemporary but the producers do try to show how it really was. Cleopatra, for instance, is attractive but short and hardly the supermodel figure so many movies portray her as while Caesar's assaination is less a careful plot and more a near-disaster. There aren't many actual battle scenes shown due to budget but the fights we get are pretty brutal and bloody like it really was and the show is great illustrating the complex political games of the time.Season two does suffer a bit as it was midway through production the producers learned they would only get 10 episodes and no third season. Thus, the stories feel more rushed as they try to fit in as much as they can. They do a good job with the battle over Antony and Cleopatra (which is far less than the epic romance most think) and bring it to as good a conclusion as they can. Through it all, the epic bromance between the two leads pulls you in as you get sucked into their lives, through thick and thin and care for their final fates.The extras are good as there are multiple audio commentaries and features on putting the show together, as well as recreating the time. The best bonus is ""All Roads Lead to Rome,"" a great subtitle guide that explains many of the references, historical notes and more on the time, showing the amazing research that went into it all and you see how true to life it is.It may have been short-lived but the series remains one of HBO's best efforts ever. Brilliantly acted and wonderful in detail, the show is a must-have for any history or drama buff to see in all its wild glory.",5,The most brutally realistic view of Rome ever and a great show to boot,1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,3375,"['First', 'off', 'do', 'have', 'first', 'two', 'season', 'sets', 'Rome', 'DVD', 'already', 'real', 'reason', 'upgrade', 'extras', 'are', 'same', 'changes', 'picture', 'bit', 'sharper', 'same', 'too.But', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'series', 'great', 'way', 'start', 'Ancient', 'Rome', 'HBO', 'way', 'amazing', 'detail', 'history', 'mixing', 'contemporary', 'language', 'scattered', 'curses', 'bloody', 'violence', 'Rome', 'constant', 'nudity', 'story', 'around', 'two', 'soldiers', 'Vorenus', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'Pullo', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'find', 'involved', 'dramatic', 'events', 'Rome', 'Julius', 'Ceasar', 'crossing', 'Rubicon', 'becoming', 'emperor', 'meeting', 'Cleopatra', 'Ceasar', 'death', 'war', 'Octavius', 'Rome', 'two', 'are', 'midst', 'handling', 'thier', 'own', 'personal', 'dramas', 'first', 'season', 'Vorenus', 'idea', 'wife', 'had', 'child', 'man', 'was', 'war', 'Pullo', 'hard-drinking', 'violent', 'ways', 'get', 'trouble.The', 'acting', 'terrific', 'two', 'leads', 'McKidd', 'most', 'time', 'bursts', 'incredible', 'violence', 'more', 'notable', 'Pullo', 'funny', 'man', 'who', ""'d"", 'go', 'straight', 'anyone', 'parth', 'trouble', 'killing', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Caesar', 'proud', 'air', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'were', 'willing', 'follow', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'Marc', 'Antony', 'arrogant', 'blowhard', 'who', 'still', 'power', 'way', 'ruling', 'class', 'best', 'cast', 'however', 'easily', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'deliciously', 'wicked', 'Atia', 'woman', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'Blackmail', 'murder', 'use', 'body', 'however', 'get', 'ahead', 'Roman', 'society.The', 'show', 'wonderfully', 'researched', 'bringing', 'era', 'life', 'never', 'nice', 'bits', 'history', 'language', 'may', 'be', 'contemporary', 'producers', 'do', 'try', 'show', 'how', 'really', 'was', 'Cleopatra', 'instance', 'attractive', 'short', 'hardly', 'supermodel', 'figure', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'portray', 'Caesar', 'assaination', 'less', 'careful', 'plot', 'more', 'near-disaster', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'actual', 'battle', 'scenes', 'shown', 'due', 'budget', 'fights', 'get', 'are', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'really', 'was', 'show', 'great', 'illustrating', 'complex', 'political', 'games', 'time.Season', 'two', 'suffer', 'bit', 'was', 'midway', 'production', 'producers', 'learned', 'would', 'only', 'get', '10', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'Thus', 'stories', 'feel', 'more', 'rushed', 'try', 'fit', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'battle', 'Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'far', 'less', 'epic', 'romance', 'most', 'think', 'bring', 'as', 'good', 'conclusion', 'can', 'epic', 'bromance', 'two', 'leads', 'pulls', 'get', 'sucked', 'lives', 'thick', 'thin', 'care', 'final', 'fates.The', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'multiple', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'features', 'putting', 'show', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'recreating', 'time', 'best', 'bonus', 'Roads', 'Lead', 'Rome', 'great', 'subtitle', 'guide', 'many', 'references', 'historical', 'notes', 'more', 'time', 'showing', 'amazing', 'research', 'went', 'see', 'how', 'true', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'short-lived', 'series', 'one', 'HBO', 'best', 'efforts', 'ever', 'Brilliantly', 'acted', 'wonderful', 'detail', 'show', 'must-have', 'history', 'drama', 'buff', 'see', 'wild', 'glory']",Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons

1073472,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B000Q66PXE,Midge,"[7, 75]","I recommend the Hist Channel's ""ROME: The rise and fall of an Empire"" instead of this HBO version of ""Rome"" if you are truly interested in ancient Roman history as I am. You won't find it on this HBO version of Rome.WARNING: Don't buy this HBO set if you plan to let your children watch it.Do NOT buy this HBO Rome video if you are interested in ancient Roman history or family movie entertainment. This HBO ROME is filled with XXX full nudity, full action sex throughout the entire video and has no historical merit.As an alternative suggestion, the History Channel's Rome video is based on well-researched, accurate historical facts presented in a chronological order as you have often seen shown on the history channel. They also recreate ancient Rome using fully recreated period attire and locations; including a narrative filled with information and recreations of historical events. The History Channel's DVD set is very nicely done and with their usual high quality production if you are truly interested in the history of ancient Rome. It is also less expensive. You can let your children watch the History Channel's video set... But NOT this HBO version.I just think you should know what you are buying especially if you have a family. This is full nudity, full action fornication, close-up, genuine XXX adult p0rn every 5 minutes throughout this entire HBO ROME video. It spends more time on the p0rn than they do the story of Rome. The core video is just a boring soap opera using historical names, interlaced with VERY adult video every few minutes. There is no historical value or movie entertainment value on this HBO video.However, if you like full XXX total nudity and full action p0rn sex on the screen, then this HBO series is for you. I'm not shocked by p0rn and I've seen a few in my time, so I caution you, this HBO ROME video isn't some momentary flash of nudity nor some prudish comment. This is a full action fornication, full lewd nudity p0rn just 2 feet from the camera lens throughout the entire video series. This is no exaggeration. They have a new sex scene every 5 minutes. This is the kind of p0rn you see at the adult book stores with the infamous ""Stormy""... except this is higher quality production which has a soap opera story to go with it. In keeping with modern p0rn, the girls are all trimmed up nicely with preference to fair with plastic surgery upgrades rather than the authentic, unshaven hairy, raven haired Italian girls of ancient Rome.  So much for authenticity...I wanted to see a historical video on Rome... and I guarantee this HBO p0rn version is not it. Even if it did not have the p0rn, it is nothing more than a slow, boring soap opera. It isn't even a good movie. It just slowly drags from one scene to the next about daily events on the road with the Roman army or political discord at the Roman Senate... interlaced with the XXX scenes.This HBO video is presented in a soap opera style so it is not a history lesson. Basically, they created a soap opera scenario about Julius Caesar and the other historical figures of ancient Rome interacting and (literally) lathered it up with HBO sex to attract viewers and recoup the money they spent on the production. They would never have added the lewd scenes if the video itself was of any quality because they would have been concerned about losing their family audience. But the scenes with Caesar, Pompey, Brutus, Anthony, etc., are all just boring soap dialogue of events without historical or entertainment value... so the only way they could have sold this video or kept an audience interest is by catering to those who enjoy raw sex and then package it in a Roman wrapper for marketing. By using this popular ancient roman theme, HBO was also able to fool those of us looking for historical videos about Rome who had no idea it was just a p0rn video in a Roman wrapper. We bought it, now we are stuck with it.When you see all of these rave reviews from other reviewers, consider their ages and gender and what they really liked about this video. I'm sure a lot of these reviewers are young males under 25... and who knows how young some of these commenters are? But there is no doubt this video series will really be a big hit with males of any age and a few females who are into this type of video. Just consider the source of those reviews.As for the kids, I'm sure this was better than national geographic photos for the kids to learn about sex while their parents think they are watching something educational. Pay attention to what your kids are watching! Frankly, I don't know how the stores are getting away with selling this on family video shelves at best-buy and on Amaz0n with no cautions or age requirements about this p0rn content.When I first read the reviews (before I watched the video), I thought it was probably just a few nude scenes and people were overreacting. As I said, I'm not easily shocked and I was interested in a quality historical video about ancient Rome. So with the rave reviews about the quality of this video, I figured a few nude scenes wouldn't be a big deal... but that is not the case with this video. Those reviewers warning of p0rn were NOT exaggerating! If anything they were understating it. It is as bad as they describe and worse! This is a p0rn video which includes a soap opera using the names of ancient Roman figures. There is no historical merit to this video. It is nothing more than a p0rn soap opera using ancient Rome as the wrapper. While they've used some historical events as backdrop, the dialogue and scenes are just soap opera interpretations of how someone in the p0rn industry might interpret daily ancient Roman life.These reviews remind me of those old comments the guys used to make about reading PB magazine for the articles... (and claimed they didn't look at the centerfold). I don't know who they were trying to convince other than to justify why they bought it. It is the same with this HBO set of videos. Don't let someone convince you this video is authentic roman history. It is just an excuse your significant other is using to get you to watch it with them. There is no historical value in this video. It is not about the history of Rome. This is a XXX p0rnographic soap opera with genuine, full action, prolonged full nudity, active, close up, fully exposed sexual fornication on the screen throughout the entire video. This is not just one or two nude scenes. It is the core focus of the entire video.Quite frankly, I'm astonished the stores were selling this for anyone to buy. This must be quite the coupe for those seeking X rated videos in dry areas of the country where there are no adult video stores like the bible belt. Kids can go in and buy it. I didn't see anything stopping minors from purchasing this set other than the price. I can only imagine how many parents have made the mistake of buying this for their family. I wonder how many know what they really bought?I am, however, grateful that I had also bought the history channel's ""Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire"" while I was at best-buy. I bought it at the same time I bought this HBO p0rn version of ""Rome"". I'm glad I had the other to watch when I found out just how bad this HBO video on Rome turned out to be. I'll save this one with the p0rn collection for that purpose, should the interest occur... because this HBO video is worthless for historical value or even movie entertainment. This is the very reason I cancelled my subscription to HBO years ago. They had turned into nothing but a lowbrow p0rn soap channel because that was all they were producing. They weren't even showing good movies anymore.This production shows that HBO hasn't improved on anything except the amount of money they have to spend on their productions... but even with the higher priced production... it is still belongs in the 86 round file based on total lack of value as entertainment and certainly of no educational value whatsoever. But if you are looking for XXX videos, this would be a better quality production than you could find in the adult video stores. So if you are looking for that kind of video... then this would be at the higher end of adult sex entertainment.",2,XXX  (Hist Chan's Rome series is better),1270339200,"04 4,

I do think that the first season is better than the second, but that's not saying it's not worth five stars as well.

1073485,A8IHLMGDIOK8L,B000Q66PXE,Pekinman,"[4, 5]","I've been watching the regular dvd release of Rome for about 3 months now.  The first time I saw it I was blown away by the art direction (magnificent sets by Joseph Bennett), the wonderful musical score by Jeff Beal and April Ferry's gorgeous costumes which won many awards.  I was also impressed by the courage of a mostly fine cast of actors who are asked in some cases to bare it all and behave in a very uninhibited manner.  There is a great deal of nudity, sex, torture, murder, opium smoking, battling armies and gang warfare.  There is also a great deal of high humor which balances out the shocking bits.  The humorous parts are also the best parts of the scripts which vary in quality depending on who the screenwriter is for the episodes.  Bruno Heller, executive producer, wrote most of the 22 episodes but is replaced by others (other producers in most cases) whose abilities with writing dialogue range from pretty good to pretty awful.The basic story arc over the 2 seasons is good but could have been much better.  The series is hobbled by one satellite story revolving around the personal life of the Jew, Timon, Atia of the Julii's household henchman who protects her property, and is also having sex with her when she allows.  The sequences involving Timon's personal family life are very boring and superfluous and add nothing to the story.  The point of the Timon side plot is apparently that his brother, Levi, has come to Rome from Palestine to kill King Herod who comes to visit and bribe Mark Antony.  That story line fizzles out in the end making the whole Timon thing a waste of time.Taking up time and celluloid to focus on this was detrimental to the overall quality of the series.For instance:  it might have been possible to include several characters who existed in history and were unceremoniously dumped from this series, like Brutus's wife, Portia, and Octavian Caesar's first wife before he married Livia who became the first Empress of Rome.There are other less obvious flaws mostly resulting from the soap-opera nature of some of the episodes.  Even the finest actors in the cast are tripped up by a quantity of fatuous dialogue, especially the overly sentimental Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson).  He's a fine actor, handsome, rugged, an ur-macho hunk of a scruffy bear, but his character devolves from being a brutal life-long legionnaire in the 13th legion to a blabber-mouthed, mawkish know-it-all who becomes particularly annoying in the 2nd season.Pullo's superior officer in the 13th is Lucius Vorenus, played with a wooden, cross-eyed peevishness by Kevin McKidd.  He's not much of an actor but he looks fabulous drenched in blood and he's got a penetrating glare that would stop a werewolf in his tracks.  McKidd is much more suited to his role as a doctor in the mundane Grey's Anatomy.The other lead actors are much better.  Polly Walker (Atia of the Julii) is the powerful matron star of the show.  It took several viewings for me to appreciate the depth of her performance.  She's not simply a horny dragon trying to control everything around her by hook or by crook but is a force to be reckoned with in the history of Roman politics, at least as her character is portrayed here.  Walker is asked to do some very outrageous things in the course of the series.  She is one of the actors who has to bare it all and behave in a most uninhibited manner before the camera.  The other great leading performance comes from Ciar&aacute;n Hinds (Julius Caesar).  His murder scene is powerful and moving and he doesn't utter a word.  He has an amazing array of facial expressions and is a very subtle actor... fascinating stuff.I have mixed reactions to James Purefoy's Mark Antony.  Perhaps he suffered more than the rest from the concept of his character by the production team.  Purefoy is surprisingly excellent playing the vulgar, brutal, egomaniacal, testosterone poisoned general.  He too must bare all which he does without self-consciousness.  I got a little tired of his inarticulate noises made during sex and domestic arguments.  Why do English actors have to pant for 30 seconds, like they've just sprinted a mile, after they've had a sexual climax?  The English male has a reputation for being less than ardent in the sack so perhaps this accounts for their inability to strike an authentic chord when they are doing sex scenes in movies.  Simon Woods (the older Octavian) is just as bad.  He acts like he's having his toenails pulled out post-coitus.Max Pirkis (Master and Commander) plays Octavian as a younger boy who is, unfortunately, replaced by Simon Woods in the last 8 episodes when he becomes Consul and First Citizen of Rome.  This is too bad because Pirkis is 10 times the actor Woods is.  In fact wood is the operative word to describe Woods's performance.  Whereas Pirkis acts with the flair and confidence of a John Gielgud, Woods comes off as a reptilian automaton.  Perhaps he was directed to be like this; whatever the cause his performance is a failure but not as bad as the actors he is surrounded with in the 2nd season.Octavian Caesar's General, Agrippa, is a priggish drip as performed by Allen Leech, and his speech writer and chief of staff, Maecenas, is bitchily performed by Alex Wyndham.  I've renamed these three puppies the Post, the Prig and the Prick.  Octavian's (2nd) wife Livia is played as a slutty airhead by Alice Henley.  All four of these pivotal characters are failures.  Clearly they were cast in this way so as to give the 20-somethings characters they can relate to, as most of the rest of the leads in the series are middle-aged.  It was a mistake to dumb-down these people.You will have to look for enjoyment in the acting of many of the smaller parts.  Lydia Biondi (Merulla) is Atia's body slave and communicates so vividly with her facial expressions as to act the more talkative characters under the table.  And there are two classic performances from two ancient actors, John Boswell as the Curiel Magistrate and Helen Stirling as the old weaver on the Aventine hill.  There is an especially hilarious performance from Camilla Rutherford as Jocasta, the friend of Octavia of the Julii (Octavian's sister).  I think Kerry Condon was cast as Octavia because she looks like Max Pirkis.  Her acting isn't much but she's lovely to look at; mostly she cries a lot and has a small repertoire of facial expressions that are effective if of limited histrionic usefulness.Lyndsey Marshal is sensational as Cleopatra.  Highly unusual and fascinating.  It is a pity more time wasn't spent in Alexandria instead of in Timon's house.  Cleopatra's son by Titus Pullo (according to this script) who is supposed to be Julius Caesar's, is played with great skill and with an engaging arrogance by Max Baldry, a stand out among the smaller parts and as competent a young actor as Max Pirkis.  And the young, pudgy lad whose name escapes me who plays the child King Ptolomy  XIII is a scream.Lindsay Duncan's Servilia of the Junii is unusually annoying.  Servilia is one of the awful bitches in the history of the Western world and in that sense Duncan is quite effective.  She causes her son Brutus, played as an effete fop by Tobias Menzies, to throw himself on the sword, as it were, of the family honor as the founders of the Republic, and die simply so that she can have her female revenge on Julius Caesar who dumped her after his wife, Calpurnia (in a brilliant performance by Haydn Gwynne) finds out about their long-time love affair.  Duncan is one of those English actresses who rubs one up the wrong way with her precious accent and empty-headed attempts at depth.  Again, this may be largely the producer's fault.  I suppose her performance must be counted a success because she inspires so much bile in the viewer, but I find myself fast-forwarding through some of her scenes now.There is much scenery chewing and over-acting from David Bamber, a notably cowardly and two-faced Cicero, and Simon Callow in a cameo role doing his usual bumbling schtick as a senator.  I did like Peter Eyre's star cameo as the prosecuting lawyer in Titus Pullo's trial for murder.  But most of the appearances of  recognizable (by U.S. audiences) U.K. television actors in small parts fall flat.There are also many fine comparatively unknown secondary actors, too many to list, but they keep this leviathan of a story afloat when it might have sunk under the weight of the questionable production choices and miscasting already mentioned.  I can't end without mentioning too horrible performances from too horrible actors; one Duro, the slave/poisoner and King Herod.  They had to have been part of a package deal by the casting agency.At least there is some satisfaction in watching Duro being tortured, stabbed a dozen times and then stuffed down a sewer hole.Rome could have been a five star event if more care had been taken in the sub-plots and casting of a few crucial characters.  And the editing and continuity leave a lot to be desired as well.  The interactive features are pretty interesting, though I'd skip the audio versions of the episodes as most of them (with the notable exception of Ray Stevenson's voice-over in one of them) are vapid and annoying.  Better to turn on the 'When in Rome' feature which has boxes of information that pop up silently during the episodes and provide some fascinating background information as you go along without drowning out the dialogue as the blabbering audio versions do.  The extra special dvd that comes between the two seasons was not really worth the trouble.  It is brief and full of a lot of self-congratulatory burbling by the production team.Still, it is a highly recommendable dvd set and is addictive.",4,"Great sets, costumes, music, a worthwhile

1073490,A1A71FUA46JTOY,B000Q66PXE,ric03,"[1, 1]","I watched Rome when it first aired on the BBC in 2005 and thought it was amazing. It's been 5 years, now, and I saw it was fairly cheap on Amazon so got it for Christmas. It's only 3 days later and I've already seen most of the first series!The thing that stands out this time around is just how good Rome was. The fall of the Roman Republic is quite possibly the most tumultuous period in Political history so the writers were always onto a winner when writing a big-budget drama. Watching the drama and violence may seem over-the-top, but practically all the major events and murders depicted here happened. In fact, if anything, despite this being one of the most violent and perverse mainstream dramas broadcast, the writers have shied away from the darker and more indulgent aspects of ancient Rome -- Mark Anthony, for instance, had several gay (as well as countless heterosexual) affairs and used to attend wild parties dressed as a god, in a chariot pulled by lions! (Anthony here, played superbly by James Purefoy, is still outrageous by modern standards, but surely the reality would have been too much to stomach for the BBC).Where the writers succeed, though, is meshing this story onto strong, utterly-compelling character-driven plotting set within a landscape so fantastically realised that practically every shot takes your breath away. The day-to-day dirty, violent, horny reality of life in ancient cities has surely never been more accurately and beautifully portrayed. The streets of Rome are alive before your eyes, and the characters whose lives you follow through them are equally captivating (the hilarious and brutal story of unlikely friends, Centurion Lucius Vorenus and legionarie Titus Pullo; the family drama of high-society Atia and her children Ovtavia and Octavian (the future emperor Augustus); the political and military careers, the lives and loves of Anthony and Caesar; and supporting plots concerning the plotting against Caesar, the working conditions of Rome, the pagan religions and sacrifices, not to mention the careers and demises of Cato, Cicero and Brutus). As I say, the writers already had writing gold before they even put fingers to keyboard, but the effort they have put in to covering so many of Rome's facets, to also create memorising and loveable characters, has to be lauded as one of the best written dramas of our age.Rome does have its faults (some historical inaccuracies and -- largely due to the events covered in series one being so powerful -- the second season isn't quite as strong), but there is nothing else like it (if you have been put off watching this from seeing the Tudors, give it a go, I think you will be surprised by the difference). I think I enjoyed Rome more second time around. I guess because it has been and gone and nothing has come close to matching it for sheer extravagance, debauchery and spectacle. I can't wait to watch it on Blue-Ray )If (as I) you are interested in reading more about Caesar and Rome after viewing this, I'd recommend Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic (which covers the same period as season one) and Caesar: The Life of a Colossus (which is a comprehensive biography of Caesar, and covers his early life and military career in Gaul as well as events after the Rubicon).",5,Rome with hindsight.,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,3302,"['watched', 'Rome', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'BBC', '2005', 'thought', 'was', 'amazing', 'been', '5', 'years', 'now', 'saw', 'was', 'fairly', 'cheap', 'Amazon', 'so', 'got', 'Christmas', 'only', '3', 'days', 'later', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'most', 'first', 'series', 'thing', 'out', 'time', 'around', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'Rome', 'was', 'fall', 'Roman', 'Republic', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'tumultuous', 'period', 'Political', 'history', 'writers', 'were', 'always', 'winner', 'when', 'writing', 'big-budget', 'drama', 'Watching', 'drama', 'violence', 'may', 'seem', 'over-the-top', 'practically', 'major', 'events', 'murders', 'depicted', 'here', 'happened', 'fact', 'anything', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'violent', 'perverse', 'mainstream', 'dramas', 'broadcast', 'writers', 'have', 'shied', 'away', 'darker', 'more', 'indulgent', 'aspects', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'Mark', 'Anthony', 'instance', 'had', 'several', 'gay', 'as', 'well', 'countless', 'heterosexual', 'affairs', 'used', 'attend', 'wild', 'parties', 'dressed', 'god', 'chariot', 'pulled', 'lions', 'Anthony', 'here', 'played', 'superbly', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'still', 'outrageous', 'modern', 'standards', 'surely', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'stomach', 'BBC', '.Where', 'writers', 'succeed', 'meshing', 'story', 'strong', 'utterly-compelling', 'character-driven', 'plotting', 'set', 'landscape', 'so', 'fantastically', 'realised', 'practically', 'shot', 'breath', 'away', 'day-to-day', 'dirty', 'violent', 'horny', 'reality', 'life', 'ancient', 'cities', 'surely', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'accurately', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'streets', 'Rome', 'are', 'alive', 'eyes', 'characters', 'lives', 'follow', 'are', 'equally', 'captivating', 'hilarious', 'brutal', 'story', 'unlikely', 'friends', 'Centurion', 'Lucius', 'Vorenus', 'legionarie', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'family', 'drama', 'high-society', 'Atia', 'children', 'Ovtavia', 'Octavian', 'future', 'emperor', 'Augustus', 'political', 'military', 'careers', 'lives', 'loves', 'Anthony', 'Caesar', 'supporting', 'plots', 'concerning', 'plotting', 'Caesar', 'working', 'conditions', 'Rome', 'pagan', 'religions', 'sacrifices', 'not', 'mention', 'careers', 'demises', 'Cato', 'Cicero', 'Brutus', 'say', 'writers', 'already', 'had', 'writing', 'gold', 'even', 'put', 'fingers', 'keyboard', 'effort', 'have', 'put', 'covering', 'so', 'many', 'Rome', 'facets', 'also', 'create', 'memorising', 'loveable', 'characters', 'be', 'lauded', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'dramas', 'age.Rome', 'have', 'faults', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'largely', 'due', 'events', 'covered', 'series', 'one', 'being', 'so', 'powerful', 'second', 'season', ""n't"", 'quite', 'strong', 'nothing', 'else', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'seeing', 'Tudors', 'give', 'go', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'difference', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'Rome', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'guess', 'been', 'gone', 'nothing', 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'sheer', 'extravagance', 'debauchery', 'spectacle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'Blue-Ray', 'are', 'interested', 'reading', 'more', 'Caesar', 'Rome', 'viewing', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Rubicon', 'Triumph', 'Tragedy', 'Roman', 'Republic', 'same', 'period', 'season', 'one', 'Caesar', 'Life', 'Colossus', 'comprehensive', 'biography', 'Caesar', 'early', 'life', 'military', 'career', 'Gaul', 'as', 'well', 'events', 'Rubicon']",Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons

1073495,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000Q66PXE,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","We just watched this again after a long time and once again, I found myself utterly riveted not just by the wonderful (creative) historical reconstruction but for the subtlety of its view of human possibility and pathological seekers of power.  This series pleases on many levels.On the one hand, the historical details are very fun:  it is the fundamental turning point of antiquity, when the Roman Republic - the last important proto-democratic experiment that had lasted 450 years - is rubbed out for good.  Julius Caesar, the greatest Roman military genius of them all, will not accept the political maneuverings of his personal foes, who wrap themselves in the call to preserve a republic that had long ceased to function.  Either Caesar is a villain bent on dictatorship, or they are demagogues - it is left to the viewer to decide.  Once Caesar is assassinated, another kind of political genius emerges, Octavian (later Augustus), who at the age of 19 climbs to the summit of power in Rome and then a few years later wins power as an enlightened despot/dictator.  You get to know Cato, Cicero, Marc Anthony, Brutus, Servilia, Cleopatra, and Agrippa, to name just a few of the characters who are all acted to perfection.On the other hand, you have the psychodramas that are going on behind the scenes.  Not only does Octavian's family, shall we say, operate with literally murderous dysfunction,  but you have Vorenus and Tullo, two more common soldiers who embody different aspects of this transitional period.  Octavian's family is typical that of brutal courtier-aristocrats, as his mother Atia seeks to manipulate events to fulfill her need for love/domination and security.  But the two working class guys, who are highly fictionalized though apparently are mentioned in Caesar's histories and who witness events as they try to build healthier family lives and make their ways outside of the military apparatus, are the most interesting in my view; they provide a wonderful melodrama that reveals much about the society and its evolution.  Of course, they do get into a few too many situations to be believable (each of them kills, respectively Cicero and Marc Anthony, for example), but they are wonderful fictional vehicles to provide an alternate view from the elites as they compete for power and fulfillment.  In my view, Vorenus embodies the virtues of the old republic, while Pullo is a pragmatic survivor who is perfect for the new era.Sure, there are lots of brutally frank depictions of sex that make this unsuitable for anyone under 16 and the violence is equally graphic.  But Rome was at that time semi-barbarous in our terms, with few possibilities to improve oneself and quick, violent ends without the possibility of the rule of law or justice.  It gets one to think about what one has, at least it did for me.Recommended with enthusiasm.  There are so many wonderful details in this, such as the scene where Marc Anthony urinates in a plant as he is talking to Cicero or Atia covered in the blood of a sacrificed bull or her order to her son:  ""don't come home until you have penetrated someone"" [for the first time].  You will laugh, you will be moved, you will feel wonder at the panorama of history, you will desire to learn more.

Grandcolas ""Stiggs""","[9, 9]","I have had a problem with the subtitles - the English language subtitles come on by themselves after about 5 to 10 minutes.  Turning them off is only temporary as they come back on after another 5 or 10 minutes.  I'm curious if anyone else has had this problem with this series.Rome is as excellent as most people say.The series gives a very good feeling for the historical time period, morality, ethics, and customs of the Roman people. The way the series is filmed makes you feel as if you are on the streets and in the homes of the people, like you know them.This is nothing like Shakespeare play nor is it a watered down or glorification of these people.  This is probably as true to the period of time as one can get in a film.Some may be bothered by the violence, language and sex - of which there is plenty - but from what I understand - these things were as prevalent then as portrayed in the series.  Its a bit disarming at first. But once you are used to it - it makes perfect sense. Parents - beware of letting your kids watch this by themselves.It is very engrossing to watch how the Romans dealt with the classes, honor, religion, politics, economy, war, love, death, money, family and friendships.The disk set has an added bonus of being able to select an on screen display that puts the scenes in historical context - explaining the Roman clothing, holidays, employment, relationships, buildings furniture, art, battles, etc. as the story progresses.  I recommend watching the series with this feature on. This means you will be highly entertained - taking in the plots, sub plots and relationships as well as getting a full fledged education on this period of history.  You will come away with a rich memory of a beautiful series as well as becoming a historical maven on this period of time.  You will be a better person for it.The photography, writing, dialogue, directing, editing, art direction, costumes, music and sets are just prefect.I must commend every single actor in this series - every performance is nuanced and real. There is not one weak actor in the entire cast and some are exceptional.I must commend the producers and HBO for taking this gamble with their money! -  And not skimping on - but hiring such a top crew and creating those marvelous sets and costumes to create a memorable, daring, and very expensive looking series.  Thank you.I have finally completed this series and stand by my original review - except for one thing - the writers or director but probably the marketing people decided at about half way through the series to add the F word into the dialogue - allot!. This was inappropriate that the characters would be using this word - especially the upscale characters. Every time the actors used this word it jolts you out of the Roman time period and atmosphere and brought you to the present - horrible mistake -very costly and disappointing. Marketing people can be morons sometimes. I often felt bad for these great actors for being forced into peppering otherwise fine dialogue with this word - and I'm not prude! - I use the F word myself on occasion - it just did fit in with the time period, atmosphere, characters and damaged an otherwise great series.

1073499,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B000Q66PXE,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[0, 0]","I'm trying this one again.  I'm not sure why certain Amazon reviews don't seem to make it into print but this is one that didn't.  In any event and in my humble opinion, ""Rome"" is one of the best things ever put on television.  Because I chanced on an HBO episode, I subscribed to HBO.  Now that HBO has cancelled this wonderful series after only two seasons, I will cancel my subscription to HBO.The series takes us through some of the most climactic events of the Roman Empire i.e. the ascension of Julius Caesar, his corruption of the Republic, his assasination and the events up until Octavian's consolidation of power.  The story, in its own way, is an 'upstairs, downstairs' kind of thing.  We watch the aristocrats in their battles for power and status.  At the same time we see lesser figures engaged in parallel power struggles.Rome is, at the same time, a society familiar and alien to us.  Motives of love and wealth are similar but Roman society, at all levels, is a complex of Mafia families vying for power.  If you and your family win, there is a chance of securing the wealth of the world.  Lose and you die, probably horribly.Slavery is as common and unquestioned as is the brutality that accompanies almost everything.  There is one fascinating scene in which the 'heroine' is having passionate sex with Marc Antony.  She asks her elderly slave...who is watching patiently in the corner...for a glass of water.  The slave, without changing expression, complies as the sex continues.  Death is commonplace and life cheap.

Primarily, the series focuses on the exploits of two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus -- played superbly by Kevin McKidd -- and Titus Pullo also portrayed superbly by Ray Stevenson.We watch through 12 season 1 episodes as Caesar rises to (and falls from) power over his mentor Pompey Magnus to create the all-powerful Rome. Marc Anthony is Caesar's right hand man. Cleopatra even makes an appearance.The series revolves around the exploits of two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus - played superbly by Kevin McKidd - and Titus Pullo also portrayed superbly by Ray Stevenson. The real fun of the show is watching Pullo and Vorenus battle violently in violent times and struggle with their own family values, loyalty to the Empire and friendship to each other.Season 2 of Rome is set circa 30 BC just after Julius Caesar's murder.In Season 2 Pullo and Vorenus become entwined with Mark Anthony and Octavian of the Julii, son of Atia (lover to Marc Anthony and others). Season 2 focuses on Octavian's rise to Emperor of Rome by political guile and bloody force.We watch through 10 Season 2 episodes as Octavian gains power over (his adversary at times--friend at times--stepfather figure at times) Marc Anthony. Cleopatra is also back and has a bigger role in Season 2.Both seasons are not always action-packed and move along a bit slowly at times, but overall they are so well done that--similar to other HBO series like The Sopranos--when they're good...they're really good.The price of this DVD series is perhaps HBO's way of saying, ""You don't like it?...Subscribe to HBO!""

If you like intelligent, well-acted, thought-provoking, kind-of-somewhat but not-really-accurate ""Historical Epics"", then Rome is the best series of its kind in television's history. True, ""I, Claudius"" offers a better script, but the production is light-years apart, and Rome's sheer breadth and attention to detail trump ""I, Claudius"" as the one Roman series to rule them all.In Blu-ray, which is the only way to get everything out of this series, you will feel a true part of Rome. The acting is exceptional all around. It's not fair to single out one great actor amongst a true ensemble cast. The story is well-known to most, the ""Dawn of the Empire"". The same 25 years of Roman History that manages to miss the other 1000 years like almost every other Roman-themed series of late.I recommend that if you do ""Rome"", do it the right way the FIRST time, or you will be spending more money later on. Nab a Blu-ray version on sale. It's worth every penny over the DVD, and the transfer and mastering are outstanding. So, suck it up and spend a couple extra bucks now. You will never make it through from Netflix or Video On Demand. Plus, a series this great will be watched multiple times.

HBO, in ""Rome"", has breathed life into well documented time period.  Those who not historically minded, will merely see this as a very well produced HBO drama.  Being hstorically minded, I am thrilled that this period of history can see life.In two seasons, viewers across North America thrilled to the power struggles within the Roman senate played out in venues from Gaul to Rome.  Caesar and his men, in battle and out, realized that the power of plebian popularity. The death of Pompeys' wife, Julia, leads to a struggle for wifery, and eventually his death.  The power play between Mark Anthony, Casesar, Vorenus, Pompey, Cato, and Brutus is fascinating.  Social standing is valued, to the extent of sacrificing personal happiness.  Integrity is merely the price of success. Ambition is the currency of Senate success.The episodes included in the set are:Stolen EagleHow Titus Pullo brought down the republicAn Owl in A ThornbushThe Ram Has Touched the WallEgeriaPharsalusUtica TriumphThe SpoilsKallends of FebruaryPassoverSon of HadesThese Being the WordsTortoise and the HareHeroesPhillipiDeath MaskNecessary FictionNo God Can Stop A Hungry ManAbout Your FatherDramatically speaking, this is a stellar production with outstanding performances.  In reading about Rome, I was fascinated that full size sets were constructed for the series accurate to the period.  Full scale models of actual artifacts were used in the production, and that is ambitious.  I can imagine that once season 2 was finished, a museum is now well stocked, and even a Roman style theme park is now fully functional.The bonus features just add more integrity to the series that was overdue, and will be missed.I cannot say enough about this series.

1073517,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000Q66PXE,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","Sadly abandoned by HBO when the rising costs of the TV series cut into the production budget too much, ""Rome"" was originally envisioned to run four or five years. The first season runs at a leisurely pace compared to season two. Telling the story of the rise of Julius Caesar, the fall of the Roman Republic and the seduction of Caesar and Mark Antony by Cleopatra (although I would point out that the seduction was mutual)from the point-of-view of two common Roman soldiers Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd best known for ""Grey's Anatomy"" in the U.S.) and Titus Pollo (Ray Stevenson)as they are thrust onto center stage after serving Caesar, ""Rome"" even in its shortened two season run manages to be compelling entertainment with enough twists and turns for TWO TV series.One of the flaws of the series was the fact that the creators had to pack so much into so little time to conclude the series. This resulted in an often fragmented second season that jumped through story often losing important elements to help explain or detail the development of the story.The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a detailed, rich presentation that has more depth than the DVD that HBO released a couple of years back. The special features included are quite nice including a pop up trivia track that allows you to learn more about Roman society as you watch the show and then seamlessly take you back to the episode you were watching.We get nearly three hours of extras primarily presented in standard definition including ""The Rise of Rome"", ""Ceasar's Triumph"" and ""Gladiator"" that focuses on the creation of these two key scenes from the film. ""The Rise of Octavian"" which details the rise to power of Rome's emperor as well as ""Antony and Cleopatra"" that gives us what we know from historical documents about the duo and their powerful alliance that united Egypt and Rome. There's also a very good featurette on the production of the second season of the series.While the series became increasingly fragmented by the second season due to the shortened production schedule ""Rome"" still manages to be a fascinating drama with strong performances throughout. Personally I feel that HBO SHOULDN'T embark on long, large scale dramas because they can't be counted on to allow the series to reach its natural conclusion unless it is a popular series like ""The Sopranos"".Recommended.",4,"Terrific presentation of a entertaining historical drama from the creator of ""The Mentalist""",1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,2357,"['Sadly', 'abandoned', 'HBO', 'when', 'rising', 'costs', 'TV', 'series', 'cut', 'production', 'budget', 'too', 'much', 'Rome', 'was', 'originally', 'envisioned', 'run', 'four', 'five', 'years', 'first', 'season', 'runs', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'compared', 'season', 'two', 'Telling', 'story', 'rise', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'fall', 'Roman', 'Republic', 'seduction', 'Caesar', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'would', 'point', 'out', 'seduction', 'was', 'mutual', 'point-of-view', 'two', 'common', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'Lucius', 'Vorenus', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'best', 'known', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'U.S.', 'Titus', 'Pollo', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'are', 'thrust', 'center', 'stage', 'serving', 'Caesar', 'Rome', 'even', 'shortened', 'two', 'season', 'run', 'be', 'compelling', 'entertainment', 'enough', 'twists', 'turns', 'TWO', 'TV', 'series.One', 'flaws', 'series', 'was', 'fact', 'creators', 'had', 'pack', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'conclude', 'series', 'resulted', 'often', 'fragmented', 'second', 'season', 'jumped', 'story', 'often', 'losing', 'important', 'elements', 'help', 'explain', 'detail', 'development', 'story.The', 'Blu-ray', 'marvelous', 'detailed', 'rich', 'presentation', 'more', 'depth', 'DVD', 'HBO', 'released', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'including', 'pop', 'up', 'trivia', 'track', 'learn', 'more', 'Roman', 'society', 'watch', 'show', 'then', 'seamlessly', 'take', 'back', 'episode', 'were', 'watching.We', 'get', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'extras', 'primarily', 'presented', 'standard', 'definition', 'including', 'Rise', 'Rome', 'Ceasar', 'Triumph', 'Gladiator', 'creation', 'two', 'key', 'scenes', 'film', 'Rise', 'Octavian', 'details', 'rise', 'power', 'Rome', 'emperor', 'as', 'well', 'Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'what', 'know', 'historical', 'documents', 'duo', 'powerful', 'alliance', 'united', 'Egypt', 'Rome', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'featurette', 'production', 'second', 'season', 'series.While', 'series', 'became', 'increasingly', 'fragmented', 'second', 'season', 'due', 'shortened', 'production', 'schedule', 'Rome', 'still', 'be', 'fascinating', 'drama', 'strong', 'performances', 'Personally', 'feel', 'HBO', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'embark', 'long', 'large', 'scale', 'dramas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'counted', 'allow', 'series', 'reach', 'natural', 'conclusion', 'popular', 'series', 'Sopranos', '.Recommended']",Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons

Rome captures the world of Rome in detail, from the music, to the graffitti on the walls, the town crier, the orgies, the parades, the gladiator pit, the calender, life at the family dinner table, the slaves,  the religious rites, the street gangs, homosexuals, the Jews, Egyptians, the barbarian tribes, the military camps, the theatre, the brothels, the opium dens, and the senate.  Rome's focus on the women of the age elevate it beyond all of the other films about Rome, even ""Spartacus"" and  Marlon Brando's great version of ""Julius Caesar"", and breaks new ground.  Like many, my only complaint is that the story ends, when in reality, the Roman Empire lasted 10,000 years, and there is much more of the story to be told.
