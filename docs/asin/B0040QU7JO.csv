1379571,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B0040QU7JO,Arch Stanton,"[14, 15]","Joan is a young girl in a small border village with ambitions of her own. She is eager to read and learn which comes into conflict with her incredibly sexist father who is the priest of the village. To ruin the ending, she becomes pope. Big shock. There really isn't much more I can say about the plot since it is more about the journey than the destination. To detail every even would ruin the film. Basically though she goes from monastery to monastery until she ends up as pope.The amazing thing about this film is that it's set in the Carolingian Empire. As far as I'm aware this era has never been filmed before. Occasionally there will be Viking movies but they always seem to raid England or Scandinavia, never France. The costumes and sets are stunning. Visually this film is a work of art. The costumes are detailed and sufficiently dirty to feel lived in and kind of like Jean-Jaques Annaud'sThe Name of the Rosethe director seems to have chosen especially weird and ugly looking people for the background players. Given the small gene pool of villages certain extreme features must have been even more common amongst the poor than the nobility. The hairstyles and dress don't help make them more attractive, especially with the ugly and realistic tonsures the priests have. Only minor thing is that Lothar has a goatee when he should have had a big mustache like all the Carolingians. In fact, I never see mustaches in films except westerns. I wonder why that is? The Dark Age country buildings are dark and cramped but the Rome sets are grand and impressive. There is a great deal of dirt on display and the prosthetics and makeup are believable. It never really delves into Carolingian culture but you get a feeling for how isolated and frightening it was back then. The story is fairly typical, one person out to prove herself while all of her colleagues put her down. The twists are fairly expected and there are no real surprises during the film.This film reflects a real love of learning and education. The authors they mention are real as are the Latin snippets and the book being discussed at the end. Little touches like watching them perforate the books so that they can bind them add greatly to the film's feeling of realism. Not that it ever feels real unfortunately. It falls into that far too typical need to have characters reflect modern beliefs rather than ancient ones. But while the people and emotions may not feel real the world that they exist in does.The two male leads are the real problem with this film. As a very strongly feminist film it's not surprising that the love interest falls into the typically female role of being supportive and nothing else. What is irritating is that both men are merely caricatures of actual characters. While her father is everything evil about men; cruel, violent, sexist, horny, hypocritical, and dismissive, her lover represents everything that's good about men: kind, compassionate, supportive, gentle, honorable, and honest. There is no flesh to these characters, no matter how hard the actors try. And David Wenham in particular does his best to make his character likable which is a far cry from his more usual roles. He's good enough that you can honestly like him even though there's nothing to him. Most of the male characters fall into one of these roles, either being evil and opposing her or being good and helping her. Sometimes the various reasons for helping can be interesting. For example, the second priest to help her does so because he's a drunken lout and enjoys a good laugh. Not deep but at least different. More often they are given no reason but that they're unpleasant.Pope Sergius II fares rather better than the other men. His is actually a character as opposed to a caricature. Most people seeing this will be astonished to see John Goodman in the role. This is a far cry from anything he's done before but he absolutely owns the character. He makes a rather grating and unpleasant man likable. I've heard people criticise his performance in this as over the top but it's supposed to be. The guy's a drama queen. His every reaction seems extreme. Also interesting is Lothar, king of the Franks. He doesn't get a chance to be particularly sexist but his ego and arrogance come right out. Joan herself never rises above her essential goodness to become a breathing character yet that is not due to the performance but the script. The actress is good, and it helps that she's not particularly attractive since that makes her fit into a male-dominated world better.This is a German production that was filmed in English. I noticed that most of the supporting cast have German names (including the lead) yet the dialogue always sounds like perfect English with an English accent. Strangely this is one of those cases where having national accents would make sense since they go from Germany to France to Italy all without changing accents. The production values are as good as any rival Hollywood movie. This film offers a good glimpse into a world long since vanished. Hopefully this film was successful enough to make more studios make movies on this time period. It really does feel like diving into a world that you've never seen.",4,Likely Your Only Chance to See the Carolingians On Screen,1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,5229,"['Joan', 'young', 'girl', 'small',

1379572,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0040QU7JO,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[15, 15]","AMAZON CUSTOMERS: Since I have been asked repeatedly by fellows here on Amazon, and I happen to know from the sellers of this edition - this DVD is in Spanish with English subtitles only. It is, I believe, a Mexican market release, but will play in NTSC Region 1 since it is designed that way. Well, from their lips to God's ears, because I'm not risking it even though Spanish is my native language!Be warned: the PAL version of this herePope Joan (Die P&auml;pstin) (La papessa) [Region 2] (2009), which is probably an Asian release (see my review), boasts English language but it is a PAL version. The ""all region"" part is misleading, because that will not play on ANY U.S. DVD player. It will only play on a PAL all-region player! A PAL all-region is not the same as an NTSC all-region player. Also be wary of what I believe is yet another PAL version that says it's all-region ... please remember it has to be NTSC no matter how many regions it says it plays.This was filmed in English and even though it has terrible dubbing (""looping"") probably because it was intended for multiple language releases, I want it IN ENGLISH!! And it isn't available that way!POPE JOAN (dir. S&ouml;nke Wortmann, 2009, in English) just aired on a channel called REELZ. My wife said we had to see it, since she's a big fan of the original novelPope Joan: A Novelby Donna Wollfolk Cross, on which this film is based. I was most anxious to see it too. It was deeply rewarding for us both. The closest thing to it is the compellingAgora. This film is nothing like any silly Joan of Arc story, so don't believe anyone who says it is.Do not confuse this with 2003'sPope Joan. In fact I see this film is all over the place and not really released in America properly. While I am reviewing the Latin American release (the only NTSC Region 1 release) I see the PAL version here:Pope Joan (2009) [Region 2],Pope Joan (2009) ( Die P&auml;pstin ) ( La papessa ) [ Blu-Ray, Reg.A/B/C Import - Netherlands]. You have been warned about getting anything in PAL since this is America.In brief, this is the imagined biography of 'Johanna von Ingelheim' (Johanna Wokalek), the German girl who was to become the mythical Pope John VIII (but there was an actual Pope John VIII so please be aware of that).Starting with her difficult birth, to her stealing her brother's identity in order to pass as a man, at the halfway mark it delves into the relative ease with which Johanna found herself elected pope. The great David Wenham is Count Gerold, who takes her in when she first goes to study. I love John Goodman as Pope Sergius, the man who gives Johanna her place of power and the final stepping stone to the papacy.The sets are lush, the locations stunning. This film really gives chills, because it is the Dark Ages, incarnated better than I have ever seen onscreen. Its realism and the attendant sadness is no mean feat for any director to realize. While thin on history, which I expected from a movie about 9th century Europe, it gives an impressionist taste of the whole thing. Even the crisis in the papacy, in which there was a new pope about every other year and some of the popes were brutes, is beautifully clear.The acting is what I sometimes call ""quackting"" (my term, do not steal it). The actors are either green, nervous or simply got shot and printed on the very first take. That often happens with European film, and the fact that the whole soundtrack is voiced-over is little help. Even the charismatic and booming Goodman re-recorded all his lines, line-for-line. I know there are reasons for this (foreign market releases), but I hate it all the same.Most especially because this film was filmed in English and English is what they are meant to be speaking.The director knows how to frame a killer shot. The crowning of Johanna is awe-inspiring: the key shot is a majestic close-up, an idea taken directly fromThe Queen. In fact we talked about Wokalek's resemblance to Helen Mirren. Then there is the slowly rising bird's-eye shot of Pope Joan as she collapses and lay dying. I can honestly admit it made me weep.This is a fun, humorous and 'natural'-feeling film. Were it not so brutal at certain moments, I'd recommend it to the entire family. It is better than similar works such asThe Pillars of the Earth, which in my opinion had value but was overall drivel. There is no other Dark Ages film with which to compare this.It is light on Church details, compared to the heavy but excellentLutherfor example; it is light on world history too, so I have seen reviews of this referring to it as ""Carolingian"". Close, but not quite: it's a little set in Germany and then in Rome, not in France. Mostly it's set in Rome, and I'm sorry but Rome was never Carolingian, Merovingian or any other kind of vingian.Still, this movie gives us all we need to know - almost all we can know - about that era. Anyone's guess, or myth, is as good as the next. This one is so good it is instructive and I almost dare to say comprehensive.The stunning old bishop who both introduces/epilogues the story - whom I mistook for Pope John VIII and I'm sure that was intended - looked fascinating. This actress' character, whose name I cannot discover, was apparently the anonymous compiler of the Medieval list of popes. She is meant to be not just a high-ranking bishop, but also to invoke man, woman, and from what I can tell, three different kinds of gay people (""100% gay"" male, ditto female, and bi) plus POSSIBLY a transgendered person.Lovely! Quite the stunning accomplishment, it moved me deeply, and I wish there had been more about this real-life bishop - whom, it is said, placed Pope Joan back into the official list when the name had been ditched. However, if you can tolerate the Spanish and don't mind subtitles, you must see this. And yet, the buyer needs to ask whether it is worth it. I find that it is, but this galactically stupid strategy of NOT releasing this in the language it was filmed is unforgivable.",5,May God Send More Women to Lead ....,1324339200,"12 20,

Only sons count and only sons got an education. {Not that this attitude would change over the next thousand years really.} Born in this world (Germany) is an extremely gifted little girl who contrary to her brother picks up writing and reading and foreign languages without problems, just because she hungers for knowledge.The intelligent heroine, Joan, soon decides that she will only be able to learn and be recognized if she is a man and seizes the opportunity of her brother's death during an attack to pose as him and live as a monk. Well, I suppose monks do not undress before each other and there was probably no public urinal at this time, so she gets away with it despite monthly periods and a voice which does not change into anything more masculine.When a severe illness threatens to expose her she leaves the abbey and eventually ends up in Rome, where due to her superior knowledge she becomes the personal advisor to the pope and eventually gets elected to be pope herself.  Of course the Catholic Church has always denied that there ever was a female pope and from all I have ever read about popes it seems even more impossible due to the fact that she was a foreigner.But the journey described  to get to the Holy Chair is fascinating enough and the images of the  life of poor peasants and wealthy Romans interesting. There is a love story built in, which sounds a little bit improbable but I guess every good story needs a little bit of sex.It is a beautiful film. Well-acted by the lead and supporting actors and it is thought-provoking film and as these are so rare, worth while watching just for that.",5,"A female pope, who would have thought",1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,2262,"['was', 'fascinated', 'book', 'got', 'DVD', 'choice', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'German', 'English', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'where', 'bought', 'all-region', 'DVD', 'when', 'play', 'regular', 'DVD', 'player', 'are', 'problems', 'can', 'play', 'laptop', 'though', 'So', 'much', 'technical', 'part.Lately', 'developed', 'taste', 'history', 'am', 'impressed', 'picture', 'drawn', 'film', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'ninth', 'century', 'time', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'unified', 'Germany', 'yet', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'misogynous', 'father', 'heroine', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'pretend', 'be', 'happy', 'birth', 'daughter', 'Only', 'sons', 'count', 'only', 'sons', 'got', 'education', 'Not', 'attitude', 'would', 'change', 'next', 'thousand', 'years', 'really', 'Born', 'world', 'Germany', 'extremely', 'gifted', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'contrary', 'brother', 'up', 'writing', 'reading', 'foreign', 'languages', 'problems', 'just', 'hungers', 'knowledge.The', 'intelligent', 'heroine', 'Joan', 'soon', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'be', 'recognized', 'man', 'opportunity', 'brother', 'death', 'attack', 'pose', 'live', 'monk', 'Well', 'suppose', 'monks', 'do', 'not', 'undress', 'other', 'was', 'probably', 'public', 'urinal', 'time', 'away', 'monthly', 'periods', 'voice', 'not', 'change', 'anything', 'more', 'masculine.When', 'severe', 'illness', 'threatens', 'expose', 'abbey', 'eventually', 'up', 'Rome', 'where', 'due', 'superior', 'knowledge', 'personal', 'advisor', 'pope', 'eventually', 'elected', 'be', 'pope', 'course', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'always', 'denied', 'ever', 'was', 'female', 'pope', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'popes', 'even', 'more', 'impossible', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'foreigner.But', 'journey', 'described', 'get', 'Holy', 'Chair', 'fascinating', 'enough', 'images', 'life', 'poor', 'peasants', 'wealthy', 'Romans', 'interesting', 'love', 'story', 'built', 'little', 'bit', 'improbable', 'guess', 'good', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'sex.It', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Well-acted', 'lead', 'supporting', 'actors', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'rare', 'worth', 'watching', 'just']",N/A
