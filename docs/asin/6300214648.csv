I guess the central question is the answer to the age-old Turing test - ""When a machine is indistinguishable from a human is it still a machine?""The plot - mad scientists create a boy robot who escapes and is adopted by a couple - is fleshed out to include scenes of emotion, action and pathos.  It is a great movie for both kids AND adults, definitely GP rated.  It is refreshing, optimistic and has a great, satisfying ending.",5,Constantly fascinating,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,555,"['Using', 'cinematic', 'scientific', 'literary', 'license', 'story', 'one', 'immediately', 'viewer', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'guess', 'central', 'question', 'answer', 'age-old', 'Turing', 'test', 'When', 'machine', 'indistinguishable', 'human', 'still', 'machine', 'plot', 'mad', 'scientists', 'create', 'boy', 'robot', 'who', 'adopted', 'couple', 'fleshed', 'include', 'scenes', 'emotion', 'action', 'pathos', 'great', 'movie', 'kids', 'adults', 'definitely', 'GP', 'rated', 'refreshing', 'optimistic', 'great', 'satisfying', 'ending']",D.

214366,A1ZJHRBLOXSDFV,6300214648,Belerophon,"[2, 2]","D.A.R.Y.L. is a largely misunderstood movie. Superficially the movie is about an experimental military project in cybernetic life forms; But really this is just the vehicle for telling a story about humanity and values like: Love, Loyalty, Friendship and  Family. This is the irony of the film. The central charachter Daryl (a 12 year old boy) is not really entirely human. He was born in a test tube and grown in an incubator. He has a human brain but its wired to a super computer chip planted deep in his brain. His concsious, memory and his personality resides here. The idea of the project being to find a way to make machines that see the world the way we do and also to make android soldiers. Something goes wrong however and Daryl starts to think and act independently. He develops feelings and all the other qualities that make a human ""Human"". One of the scientists working on the project decides that Daryl is for all intents and purposes human and smuggles him out of the research facility to save him from destruction (because he is a prototype). The scientist does smuggle Daryl out successfully but dies in the process. Daryl stranded on top of a mountain is picked up by some well meaning people traveling in the area and they drop him off at an orphanage. This is where the story really takes off. Daryl does not have any past or parents so he has no memories of these things and everyone believes he has shock induced Amnesia. He is placed in a foster home with a couple who have been looking to adapt a child. They fall in love with Daryl and desperately want to adapt him. Unbeknownst to them the military wants him back and will stop at nothing to get him.While not rising to the level of art; this is one of my absolute favorites and one the finest movies ever produced on many levels. The plot is unlikely but is made to work beautifully. The story line flows and everything blends together perfectly. The acting is extremely good especially by Barret Oliver who plays Daryl. Not to take anything away from the rest of the cast who are first rate. There are some humerous moments in the movie as well. These are incidental and appropriate and never degenerates into comedy. The ending is as perfect and ending as you could wish for. It is the happiest most joy filled ending to any movie I have ever seen and is accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack by Teddy Pendergrass called ""Somewhere I belong"". I highly reccomend this film. It is highly sensitive to the value of Human life and Decency. Has great replay value and its extremely family friendly. I hope they put this on Blu-Ray.",5,D.A.R.Y.L.

Rossi,"[11, 13]","Sure it's about as syrup heavy on the compassion scale as an 80's movie can get, but where else will you find such an incredible story of humanity as in D.A.R.Y.L. ?Government builds a robot child different than the cyborgs we've seen before. This is not a terminator type robot with a metal endoskeleton covered by flesh, this is a true human boy with a computer for a brain.One of the research scientists sets Daryl free in the woods and there is where the adventure truly begins. He is taken in by a group home for boys and then sent to live with foster parents until someone comes to claim him. Daryl meets the boy next door, nicknamed  Turtle and starts to understand what friendship is all about. His foster dad, played by Laverne & Shirley's ""Lenny"" Mike Mckean in a completely normal dad role, teaches Daryl baseball while Turtle's sister gets him into video games. His foster mom is surprised to find his incredible talent at piano playing and the fact that he irons his own clothes. It's all going so well that you just know trouble is on the horizon.The other two researchers on the project show up to claim their ""son"" Daryl and bring him back to the lab to study his memory banks on what he's learned. Plus, even more grim is the fact the military wants Daryl to go to the scrapheap. The deadline is on to save this all too human child from being the target of the military's junk pile. The film then becomes an action filled thrill ride that is truly unforgettable.What makes this film rise above it's all too Hollywood heavy handed emotionalism is the one fact that is inescapable about Daryl: (played perfectly by Barrett Oliver) He really IS human, and can grow up just as a normal boy with a human brain can. This movie is still just as enjoyable to watch as it was when it hit theaters in the mid 80s.

214379,ALP5YTSQO6VMD,6300214648,Gregory Dowling,"[24, 25]","I am thrilled this film is out on DVD.  I was about Daryl's age when this film came out, and I just loved it.  It was ahead of its time in its exploration of humanity versus technology.  Daryl is a part human, part robotic child, who, as you may guess has many special talents that other children do not have.  He is abandoned by a scientist and left on his own, until he is adopted by a foster family.  Of course, the military wants him back, and the argument ensues as to whether Daryl is a mere lab rat, or if he has developed to such a degree that there is nothing that distinguishes him from other humans.  The story is very magical, and while there are many twists you will anticipate well-before, the real magic is in the performances, especially that of Barret Oliver, who was one of the best child actors of the 80s, and beyond.  He breathes life into Daryl, and his melt-your-heart smile brings such genuine pathos into the story.  I am a little annoyed that the DVD art has Michael McKean and Mary Beth Hurt above the title because the movie belongs to Barret Oliver. Having seen it again in adulthood, I felt that rush of nostalgia for family films that are warm and magical, yet do not insult the intelligence.  With the holidays coming up, this is a movie kids will love and adults may as well.  It's fast paced, charming, and has some genuine tear-jerking moments.  I have noticed amid the reviews it has been compared several times to Spielberg's A.I.  While I think A.I. is a brilliant film, and the comparison's are inevitable, they are VERY different films.  A.I. is far too dark, disturbing, and philosophically complex for younger viewers.  D.A.R.Y.L. is the kind of movie I miss, a technically well made, beautifully acted, and magical film.  It stirs the imagination, and avoids degenerating into cynicism, a trait all too common in today's films.  Do yourself and your children a favor and treat them to this film.

He once told me about a mission he was flying, at [I'm going to  assume that this is still a Classified number] feet at the edge of the  stratosphere, confident that there was no aircraft on earth that could come  anywhere NEAR him.  Suddenly, just a few miles away, he saw a black blur.  The overwhelming thing for him was that the black blur was on its way  straight UP.  He pointed the nose of the U-2 up and watched the other  aircraft &quot;top out&quot; [another probably still-Classified number]  feet higher.  He said that it was the most awe-inspiring thing he's seen  before or since.D.A.R.Y.L. is an interesting movie.  It has some  thought-provoking ideas about the future of Artificial Intelligence and a  (ho-hum) car chase.

214384,A1HO9J4DCQDGP9,6300214648,"Kali ""bengaligirl""","[10, 11]","A heart-warming story about a genetically engineered child whose brain is a computer processor and his physical strength is that of a young adult.  Daryl as he is called, however, was not created to interact with other  people, least of all a childless family who grow to love him when he put  into their care.  His ""escape"" into the real world (aided by a military  scientist who gets a dose of conscience) teaches him things he would never  have learnt in the artificial world he was being raised in.  Befriended by  Turtle, an ordinary child, Daryl is integrated into family life, and soon  acquires emotions, such as love, friendship and compassion, the very things  he was denied in his artificial world.  There are many touching scenes such  as Daryl purposely pretending he can't hit the ball properly during a  baseball practice so his adopted mother will feel wanted and needed by him.  Eventually however Daryl is returned to his origins, to a world that is  now alien to him, and his knew found emotions and ethics soon make him  redundant in the eyes of his creators.  However Daryl's changes have been  noticed by a once hard line scientist who realizes that the boundary  between computer and child have been breeched and to terminate his  existence is to murder a child, even if the child has somewhat usual mental  and physical capabilities such as driving cars, flying military planes and  creating an effective escape stragegy that will help him return to the  family and friends he has grown to love.  The final scene in the movie is  poignant as Daryl bought back from the brink of ""death"" by yet another  scientist who also now realizes that Daryl is in fact a child and not a  super-computer and his return to his adopted family is heart-wrenchingly  touching.  There is a great musical score to accompany this film, plus some  above average acting, especially from Daryl, as well as many funny and  often moving moments.  Watch out for the scene at the Cash Point, it  tickled my funny bone no end.

I remember seeing it and thinking, 'How great would it be to be a robot!'  For a few months after seeing the film, I tried living life robotically.  I would approach my problems in a cold, logical manner - no friends, no flirting with girls - and I tried not to ever laugh.

You should have seen the stares THAT got!  I think people really started to think I was a robotic being!Eventually though, enough taunting and failure on the baseball field helped me realize that I was just a mere human after all, and that I had better stop pretending.
