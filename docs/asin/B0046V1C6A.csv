But a night at a drag cabaret changes his life, when he first decides to prepare to enter an amateur drag contest to win a cash prize, and this awakens new possibilities for his life that he had never imagined.A simplistic though offbeat story, by writer/director Ricky Reidling (who also plays Kevin), with a well-chosen cast. It could be a learning experience for those who weren't aware how much effort goes into being a female impersonator, and the fact that not all drag queens are gay. True devotees of drag will roll their eyes at the efforts of the actors attempting the craft. who would be extremely unlikely to make a living at this in real life. Call it a mildly amusing film that is really a coming-of-age story more than about drag, per se.  DVD has trailer, commentary and outtakes.",4,Simple but sweet story of one man's introduction to drag.,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,933,"['Heels', '2010', 'Kevin', 'Richards', 'facing', 'lost', 'third', 'job', 'six', 'months', 'girlfriend', 'threatening', 'kick', 'out', 'night', 'drag', 'cabaret', 'life', 'when', 'first', 'prepare', 'enter', 'amateur', 'drag', 'contest', 'win', 'cash', 'prize', 'new', 'possibilities', 'life', 'had', 'never', 'imagined.A', 'simplistic', 'offbeat', 'story', 'writer/director', 'Ricky', 'Reidling', 'who', 'also', 'Kevin', 'well-chosen', 'cast', 'could', 'be', 'learning', 'experience', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'aware', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'being', 'female', 'impersonator', 'fact', 'not', 'drag', 'queens', 'are', 'gay', 'True', 'devotees', 'drag', 'will', 'roll', 'eyes', 'efforts', 'actors', 'attempting', 'craft', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'unlikely', 'make', 'living', 'real', 'life', 'Call', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'film', 'really', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'more', 'about', 'drag', 'se', 'DVD', 'trailer', 'commentary', 'outtakes']",N/A
