489030,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,7885283976,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[3, 5]","It's clear, Aftershock is a mixture of sentimentality and epic disaster. Based on the 1976 horrible Tangshan earthquake, where 240,000 lives were lost, the story focuses on the life of life of a mom, father, and two small children, who become separated during the devastation. Dad was killed, and the boy and girl are pinned beneath concrete slabs. One can be saved, and with pressure by the rescuers, mom is forced to select the boy, who loses an arm. However, the girl believed to be dead, is not, and soon taken in by another family.The time period shifts to 1995 where the daughter plans to study medicine, but through another course in her life, must leave those studies. Meanwhile the son and his mother live together, and mother suffers greatly with the idea of the choice she made. The son lives with being a handicap and as he grows to be a man, his concern for his mother's well-being is evident over her long-term grief.This is clearly a grand movie, very well done, from the musical score, the earthquake visuals, the images of thousands of people, to the acting of the main characters. The landscape is vivid and spectacular.But most of all, the story is well-done, with a strong theme of grief by the mother, and the abandonment by the daughter. The connection of grief the mother carries for years is juxtapose to the longtime feeling of unwantedness by the daughter. There is nothing rushed about the movie, giving the viewer time to absorb the characters, to feel the moods, to acknowledge the relationships, to understand the emotional turmoil that lives in people.Excellent film, on a grand scale! .....

When there was one tomato left, the mother will give it to the son, and the daughter said she wanted one too.Then when it is the choice whether to save the son or the daughter, the mom reluctantly chose the son.  The daughter then felt betrayed, and even when there were opportunities for her to go back to find the mother and the brother, she didn't do that.In her words, it is ""It is not that I cannot remember, but that I cannot forget"".After these 23 seconds of the earthquake, the next 32 years of the life of the daughter changed.

489034,A1CHM200OEN65X,7885283976,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[2, 3]","Twenty years ago, I traveled through much of China, but in the years since I've had a hard time finding films that represent the modern country and lifestyle. Most Chinese films that make it to America focus on magic realism and/or martial arts, such as one of my favorites, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" With no prior knowledge of ""Aftershock,"" I picked up the DVD and watched it with my wife.From the opening scenes, I was moved by this film. ""Aftershock"" takes us back to 1976, to the most deadly of modern earthquakes, and uses good special effects to show us the devastation that led to 240,000 dying in a matter of minutes. Two young twins are caught under a concrete slab, and the mother must choose which one will be saved, as the moving of the slab will kill the other child. In some heart-breaking scenes, the mom chooses to save her son. Years go by, during which she raises her boy and tries to deal with her guilt. Meanwhile, her daughter survives and is adopted by two rescue workers, a husband and wife in the military.The movie is a sweeping epic in many ways, showing us these different characters' lives and choices. It has humor, sorrow, and romance. At times, it fails to fully engage us in some of those different life choices, because we don't have time to see some of those elements fleshed out. Nevertheless, it leads to dramatic final scenes when the family members are reconnected in 2008.As a Westerner, I loved seeing the differences in culture represented here. Certain scenes are rendered with great melodrama, and others are passed over with understatement. Oftentimes, the balance of those moments is the opposite of the way a Hollywood film would do it. This adds so much to the experience, also giving us insights into the Chinese mindset and family structure, but also creates some emotional obstacles from a Western viewpoint. The decision, for example, to have grandmothers raise healthy parents' children is one that seems accepted, almost expected.The photography is excellent, the acting is strong (except for a bit of wooden dialogue delivered in the English-speaking scenes), and there are some moments in this powerful story that will leave you quaking within.

Starting with the Tangshan earthquake of 1976 the story takes you on an emotional rollercoaster where you not only see China and its change through 30 years but are offered a glimpse of Chinese everyday life and family relations which to me were different and enlightening. For those with interest in disasters and survivors guilt that too is very well done.The director Xiaogang Feng is easily becoming one of China's greatest directors and with his films you cannot go wrong.

The beginning scenes of 1976 were superbly done, and story-telling was really good. I do not know much about Chinese or Asian family dynamics, but can only guess. The theme was universal--the dilemma a parent has to endure in extreme situations, the guilt, the quest for healing and redemption.

489040,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,7885283976,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 15]","With its epilogue, the Chinese epic ""Aftershock"" makes it known that it wants to stand as a tribute to the estimated 240,000-250,000 lives lost in the devastating earthquake in Tangshan circa 1976. This horrendous quake decimated the city, destroyed lives, and ripped families apart. And any film that wants to honor the heroism and perseverance of the citizens that emerged from tragedy to rebuild not only their city but their lives is worthy of respect for its good intentions. But as I've said often in judging films--good intentions only take you so far! ""Aftershock"" is much more than its message--it is also an unforgettable and compelling family drama that spans over 30 years. It is an extremely satisfying historical epic that also tells a quietly powerful story about the long range affects that one night had on a family (and by extension, a nation). So, by all means, come to ""Aftershock"" for its good intentions but don't lose sight that it is also tremendous filmmaking!If I had my druthers, I would have wanted to go into the film without knowing the major components of its plot. However, some of the details seem to be inescapable if you look at any of the marketing material, advertising, or product descriptions. The film does begin with a spectacular sequence recreating the Tangshan quake. It's a realistic and harrowing depiction that would stand on par to any contemporary special effects you'd see in Hollywood blockbusters. But this is no empty headed disaster film (which I love), but something much more heartfelt and affecting. On this fateful evening, a family of four is divided and it's not until 32 years later where they will all understand the truth of the night. The father is killed, the mother and her son live haunted by their memories, and the daughter is raised by a foster family. We see all the characters at intervals in their lives and, though the earthquake may be history, it and its aftershocks are carried within the psyche of everyone that lived through it. The film culminates with a 2008 Sichaun earthquake that forces our characters to confront one another again. It's incredibly potent and moving drama. Truly!I, more than anything else you're likely to read, have been purposefully vague about the details of the movie. The film would be better served if its plot unraveled naturally without expectation. Wildly popular in China, ""Aftershock"" has become that country's highest grossing domestic film ever and was submitted for Academy consideration as China's contender for a Best Foreign Film Oscar (although sadly, it was not nominated). The cast is superb and the screenplay is surprisingly understated. The film is wildly dramatic but it wisely stays away from melodrama. In other hands, this story might have been engineered as weepy and overwrought. Here, I believed the final revelations and reunions because they played on a more realistic keel. They're still likely to make you cry like a baby, but none of the emotion is forced or false. Great actors, with a great screenplay, in a great film. In case I haven't been clear, I think ""Aftershock"" is quite a special film! Check it out.

However, in an effort to rate objectively, I settled for 4 stars because it ran somewhat slow and those who want more action or suspense (beyond the actual earthquake scenes) would be disappointed.  I feel a 5 star rating should be reserved for movies that successfully incorporate those elements as well.  That having been said, I do highly recommend it.  I enjoyed it not only for it's aforementioned merits but also for its  glimpse of life within communist China that showed how dramatically lives began changing during the country's move into the 21st century, and how universal the nature of grief and the way human beings react to loss is so movingly portrayed.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[16, 19]","To understand the scale of what happened in Tangshan in 1976, if you consider that the two atomic bombs detonated detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki between them killed 220,000 people.The Tangshan earthquake lasted slightly less than a minute, killed 250,000 people. Before the earthquake fish jumped out of aquariums.  89% of the buildings in Tangshan were reduced to rubble, and a million people were left homeless.  Aftershock tracks the story of one family, and its effect on them.A young mother is faced with a crushing dilemma.  Both her six year old twin children are trapped under a huge concrete beam.  One cannot be rescued without the other being crushed to death.  We don't know if another aftershock will kill both of them at any moment.  She decides to save her son.  She lays the daughter next to the body of her husband believing her dead.  However, the daughter regains consciousness, and is adopted by a soldier and his wife.  The mother, believing her daughter dead has to live with the consequences of her decision.  The daughter faded in and out of consciousness during the rescue, we don't know how much she heard of rescue attempt.  However, her subsequent behavior offers clues.So we follow their lives from then to the present day.  We understand their suffering because it makes sense, there are mysteries within the movie, such as will daughter and mother ever be reunited, or will the twin siblings ever be reunited.  We hope that for the sake of the story it will happen, but the fact that the daughter marries and moves to Canada seems to indicate otherwise.Aftershock, is cinematic storytelling at its best.  We don't have understand Chinese to fell gripped by the emotions that are unfolding onscreen.  Our own humanity abd abillty to feel bridges any language barrier.  I feel that Afershock is truly an emotional masterpiece, and the director Xiaogang Feng is the James Cameron of China, and this movie is China's Titanic.I believe this movie is a very important milestone in Chinese filmmaking history, as much if not more than the better known movies such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  I am very impressed with the quality of foreign movies this year particularly the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, which challenge Hollywood to improve its own standards of storytelling.  Foreign moviemakers are now regularly making movies as good as anything being made in Hoillywood, and that's a very good thing.Aftershock is one of the best foreign movies I have ever seen.  I hope you will experience it too.  I think you will love it.",5,An emotional masterpiece,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,2574,"['understand', 'scale', 'what', 'happened', 'Tangshan', '1976', 'consider', 'two', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'detonated', 'detonated', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'killed', '220,000', 'people.The', 'Tangshan', 'earthquake', 'lasted', 'slightly', 'less', 'minute', 'killed', '250,000', 'people', 'earthquake', 'fish', 'jumped', 'aquariums', '89', '%', 'buildings', 'Tangshan', 'were', 'reduced', 'rubble', 'million', 'people', 'were', 'left', 'homeless', 'Aftershock', 'story', 'one', 'family', 'effect', 'them.A', 'young', 'mother', 'faced', 'crushing', 'dilemma', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'twin', 'children', 'are', 'trapped', 'huge', 'concrete', 'beam', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'rescued', 'other', 'being', 'crushed', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'aftershock', 'will', 'kill', 'moment', 'save', 'son', 'daughter', 'body', 'husband', 'believing', 'dead', 'However', 'daughter', 'consciousness', 'adopted', 'soldier', 'wife', 'mother', 'believing', 'daughter', 'dead', 'live', 'consequences', 'decision', 'daughter', 'faded', 'consciousness', 'rescue', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'heard', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'However', 'subsequent', 'behavior', 'offers', 'clues.So', 'follow', 'lives', 'then', 'present', 'day', 'understand', 'suffering', 'sense', 'are', 'mysteries', 'movie', 'such', 'will', 'daughter', 'mother', 'ever', 'be', 'reunited', 'will', 'twin', 'siblings', 'ever', 'be', 'reunited', 'hope', 'sake', 'story', 'will', 'happen', 'fact', 'daughter', 'marries', 'moves', 'Canada', 'indicate', 'otherwise.Aftershock', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'understand', 'Chinese', 'fell', 'gripped', 'emotions', 'are', 'unfolding', 'onscreen', 'own', 'humanity', 'abd', 'abillty', 'feel', 'bridges', 'language', 'barrier', 'feel', 'Afershock', 'truly', 'emotional', 'masterpiece', 'director', 'Xiaogang', 'Feng', 'James', 'Cameron', 'China', 'movie', 'China', 'Titanic.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'very', 'important', 'milestone', 'Chinese', 'filmmaking', 'history', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'better', 'known', 'movies', 'such', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'quality', 'foreign', 'movies', 'year', 'particularly', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'series', 'challenge', 'Hollywood', 'improve', 'own', 'standards', 'storytelling', 'Foreign', 'moviemakers', 'are', 'now', 'regularly', 'making', 'movies', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'being', 'made', 'Hoillywood', 'very', 'good', 'thing.Aftershock', 'one', 'best', 'foreign', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'hope', 'will', 'experience', 'too', 'think', 'will', 'love']",N/A
489044,A3O2Y1MVIY77IE,7885283976,"Mary McGreevey ""frwhiskey""","[1, 2]","I have been interested in China since a chance trip brought me there with a friend in 1990, where we travelled cheaply together from Beijing down to Shanghai and then Hong Kong.  I saw a lot of the more desperate parts, since we were on the cheap, in hostels, sometimes student dormitories, often trains, buses and bicycles that got us away from the slowly (very slow then) modernizing big cities.Since that time, in spite of my revulsion against the hard-heartedness of that culture amongst the people themselves, let alone to us foreigner big-noses, I took an interest as never before, reading all the oldest books I could find in the San Francisco libraries, watching old 1950's/60's CP propaganda films, and getting excited when a new film comes out from now very-chop-chop modernizing China.  This does not indicate a love of a culture, but a strange fascination with its thinking, its defects, its long history of bloodshed and desperate poverty, its closedmindedness, its vicious warlordism.  Above all, the male attitudes towards the Chinese women is a truly horrendous history.  It's one that draws me in to know and understand its subtleties, different from Europeans' or North Americans' traditional male views.With this preface, I want to say that this film was absolutely, to my mind, a propaganda piece about Chinese women, and their relationships in a drastically changing society, since the 1950's onward.  The basic plot begins with the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed 240,000 people in their stone-masonry classic old buildings.  The plot is fiction, bringing up a family of two children - twins age 7, a girl and a boy.  Only the boy can be saved, say the PLA (People's Liberation Army) rescuers, so the mother chooses the son.  The girl is left for dead, but awakes in the dark rain to discover she's been laid in the street next to her father with thousands of other dead.  Filthy, wet, in rags, in shock, she wanders, and gets put into a PLA camp for orphans.  Childless parents can come and stare at them, chose one for adoption, and in the case of the girl, she is chosen for her looks.  The boys have probably all been taken, if they're not handicapped, so the girl becomes adopted by professional Army officers, husband and wife with relatively cushy jobs, apartment, big canteen for public eating, school for the children:  i.e., priviledged in 1976.The plot is perfectly calculated, as Colleen McCullough plotted the impossible-love-affairs novels such as THE THORNBIRDS.  The Chinese always prefer a son, and often kill their daughters, in the old days by exposure to elements, drowning, or by selling them; these days it's abortion freely available with ultrasound to figure out the gender in advance and kill the right one.  So, we have the mother, so desperate and distraught, following her instincts - perhaps arguably universal, not just Chinese - to save the boy, since he will grow up and take care of her in his old age, while a daughter would be married off.  HOWEVER!!! He is HANDICAPPED!  He's got only one arm, and in CHina then, a one-armed male could not easily find any work, let alone a wife to produce sons.This is for the Chinese viewers the perfect plot teaser right off the bat - the girl is sound, living in relative luxury, getting a brilliant education, getting the priviledges of the army elite, getting accepted in 1986 into medical school.  The boy is lackadaisical, indifferent to his studies, fatherless, and living on the poor wages of his factory-worker single mother.  Already the tension is growing!  Which of these twins will actually bring the mother glory & honor?  It sure seems that the boy is doomed for success, nor does he seem to care at all.But the plot is twisting - the girl IS accepted in extreme competition for the very coveted spot of medical studies, yet in her 6-bunkbed dorm, she begins to sleep with a devil-may-care older boy, and gets pregnant in her fourth year.  She could go get the abortion that every young Chinese woman with ambition would do, but she saw too much death in 1976, stepping over the earthquake-crushed bodies.  She tells the lover-boy that she will go off and have that child anyway, and she abandons her lucky-ticket future career.  She is always portrayed as ""good-looking"", which many Western or African eyes could not see, but she is certainly not ugly as her brother is.She has the child, A GIRL, and somehow carries on by working as an English translator single mom.  She KEEPS THE CHILD, although it is not a boy.  In a society where a woman is allowed only one child, this can be seen as a big plot element, invisible to the nonChinese viewer.  She cannot have another child, and never to have a son, especially as a single woman is considered a terrible thing.Meanwhile, we see the grown son refuse to study, the mother agonizing and demanding that he conform, but he goes off with some buddies and bedrolls to seek his fortune, and lo and behold, years later he comes back RICH!!!! (How?  Why?  Is it possible that he has such a nice car????  Is it some travel agency or what?)  So the plot twists:  he succeeds in spite of a very serious drawback in the Chinese mind:  the physical handicapp, and lack of qualifications.  But he gets RICH in a nonconventional way without joining proper professions or Communist party organizations.  He now can really help his poor ""aging"" mother, PLUS he can attract a woman (good-looking?  hard to say) to be his wife and bear a SON!!!The dropout daughter, getting older at her miscellaneous jobs, dragging the daughter to her worksites (people's homes), suddenly has her turn of luck:  she manages to grab a foreign male, an older man, a lonely lawyer, and she gets the golden ticket out of china, off to Vancouver, into a big suburban house.  So now SHE is on top!  Never mind her failures so far - med school, wrong gender child, and lack of professional luck or ambition.  She's got a SUGAR DADDY!When with the progress of time we see China modernizing from 1976 old brick towns, bicycles, green/blue loose trousers-and-jacket look-alike clothes, to modern 1995 Tangshan, we see that a huge LEAP FORWARD has happened in China since the death of Chairman Mao.  To get rich is glorious, and she has done it!  So has the son!  Each in their own ways, they have defied the odds, and so we the viewers can compare and contrast; yet the Chinese viewers thinks constantly of the gender, the money, the professional ties and connections, the handicapp, and then the greencard out of China.  And the gender of the grandchildren!When finally the two grown twins are reunited, 32 years later, with their mother, by yet another big-disaster earthquake, we see the mother breaking down, screaming in apology at first, then blaming the daughter for not getting in touch with her all these years.Many modern Chinese films are done in a less subtle way, making children the focus, making the one-child family look normal, making Chinese mothers seem calm and reasonable and equal in their treatment of their children, showing no favoritism, but all who know this culture know full well that it cannot be eliminated so easily just by raising the standard of living of some parts.I write this strange review, after having read the others here on Amazon, to encourage a nonChinese viewer to consider that this is a big and expensive Chinese government propaganda piece.  They know at the top that the culture has to change, but the males who lead at the top are traditional, as in most countries, and do not welcome ""women's lib"", for they know full well that Chinese  girls are just as smart and capable as the boys.  In fact, the fear of the women's intelligence is part of what the Party, and the Emperors' rules and Confucian ideals for millenien, is what operates in persuading the average low-income man or woman, the great masses, to prefer a boy.  These films are meant to educate, not just entertain, to lift up the old thinking.  Do they work?  I don't know, but I can only guess that it's only when an economy surges forward, hiring millions of young women with nimble fingers and very low salaries, that the Chinese world may tilt just a few degrees more towards the women's equality.  When computers now dominate around the world, women can compete on an equal basis, too, in business and management and other types of education, since physical strength is no longer necessary in the one-child-only to support the aging parents.Well acted, well-costumed, and gripping enough to keep any viewer hooked until the end....  Consider how often the women are portrayed as miserable, depressed.But I say, read the books of PEARL S.BUCK, a classic American writer born and raised in China over 100 years ago, who wrote extremely insightful books about Chinese minds.  ALICE HOBART TISDALE wrote in the 30's and 40's about the China she knew from years of moving about there with a husband who sold oil for Standard Oil.  These American writers' books were bestsellers in the English world, for discussing in depth the average Chinese person's thinking, both with sympathy and foreign objectivity.Consider modern government-made films (go, PLA!) as opening doors into a vast world of books that tell of the real China, its people and minds.",4,"Well-done story of modern China, only a bit too manipulated in its

489049,A14GK0E64J0WAS,7885283976,Paul Allaer,"[4, 6]","""Aftershock"" (136 min.) was originally released in China in 2010, and now has finally been released in the US on DVD. The movie brings the fictional tale of one family involved in the real-life 1976 Tangshan earthquake (in which 240,000 people perished). The first half hour of the movie brings the actual earthquake, which is film very impressively, and its immediate aftermatch, in which, among others, a mother must make a heartbreaking choice which of her two young children to save from under the rubble (as for reasons too long to explain here it is not possible to save both kids).Unbeknownst to the mother, who had chosen to save the son over the daughter, the daughter in fact miraculously survives as well. Abandoned by the mother, the little girl is adopted into a new family. From there the movie explores 30+ years of how the family copes with the emotional aftershock of the earthquake. I don't want to give much more away of the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.This was clearly a big-budget movie, and audiences in China reacted widely positively to the movie, making it the highest grossing Chinese-made movie ever in no time. While watching this film , you will undoubtedly also notice that this movie was made with the official support of the Chinese government. Indeed, the People's Liberation Army is shown in nothing but the most positive way, and there are a number of other scenes that border nothing short of official propaganda. That aside, the movie does carry quite a bit of emotional punch, in particular towards the end when all is resolved.",4,Entertaining Chinese box office champion,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,1602,"['Aftershock', '136', 'min', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'China', '2010', 'now', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'US', 'DVD', 'movie', 'fictional', 'tale', 'one', 'family', 'involved', 'real-life', '1976', 'Tangshan', 'earthquake', '240,000', 'people', 'perished', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'actual', 'earthquake', 'film', 'very', 'impressively', 'immediate', 'aftermatch', 'others', 'mother', 'must', 'make', 'heartbreaking', 'choice', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'save', 'rubble', 'reasons', 'too', 'long', 'explain', 'here', 'not', 'possible', 'save', 'kids', '.Unbeknownst', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'chosen', 'save', 'son', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'fact', 'miraculously', 'as', 'well', 'Abandoned', 'mother', 'little', 'girl', 'adopted', 'new', 'family', 'movie', '30+', 'years', 'how', 'family', 'emotional', 'aftershock', 'earthquake', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'much', 'more', 'away', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.This', 'was', 'clearly', 'big-budget', 'movie', 'audiences', 'China', 'reacted', 'widely', 'positively', 'movie', 'making', 'highest', 'grossing', 'Chinese-made', 'movie', 'ever', 'time', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'also', 'notice', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'official', 'support', 'Chinese', 'government', 'Indeed', 'People', 'Liberation', 'Army', 'shown', 'nothing', 'most', 'positive', 'way', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'scenes', 'border', 'nothing', 'short', 'official', 'propaganda', 'aside', 'movie', 'carry', 'quite', 'bit', 'emotional', 'punch', 'particular', 'towards', 'end', 'when', 'resolved']",N/A

The first twenty minutes of the film are all about the earthquake and CGI. After that it becomes pure drama, spanning thirty two years, from the 1976 earthquake in Tangshan (in the Hebei Province) building to a crescendo culminating in 2008 with the devastating earthquake in Sichuan.All of the performances, except the guy who plays the daughter's foreigner husband, are top notch, especially Xu Fan (the director's real life wife) as the mother. There are all kinds of wonderful and heartbreaking scenarios touching on the nature and loyalties of family.I was moved to tears several times during the film but more from just thinking about the scenarios than from any melodramatic presentation. Aftershock has a disjointed narrative from time to time and could probably be improved with a second round of editing. Several scenes appear to be part of something larger that got cut, and a few seem irrelevant. The director's decision to downplay the climax as long as he can is a little disappointing but it fits with the repressed emotional level of the rest of the film after the initial earthquake sequence which, as we are reminded of in a slightly awkward memorial ending that closes the film, is its devastating heart.Aftershock has structural weaknesses but it's a magnificent and heart-rending story with a lot of legs. Highly recommended to those who like that kind of thing.",5,It's easy to ignore the propaganda and be moved to tears by the story,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,1499,"[""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'story', 'so', 'moving', 'shortcomings', 'telling', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'overlooked', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'earthquake', 'CGI', 'pure', 'drama', 'spanning', 'thirty', 'two', 'years', '1976', 'earthquake', 'Tangshan', 'Hebei', 'Province', 'building', 'crescendo', 'culminating', '2008', 'devastating', 'earthquake', 'Sichuan.All', 'performances', 'guy', 'who', 'daughter', 'foreigner', 'husband', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'especially', 'Xu', 'Fan', 'director', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'mother', 'are', 'kinds', 'wonderful', 'heartbreaking', 'scenarios', 'touching', 'nature', 'loyalties', 'family.I', 'was', 'moved', 'tears', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'thinking', 'scenarios', 'melodramatic', 'presentation', 'Aftershock', 'disjointed', 'narrative', 'time', 'time', 'could', 'probably', 'be', 'improved', 'second', 'round', 'editing', 'Several', 'scenes', 'appear', 'be', 'part', 'something', 'larger', 'got', 'cut', 'few', 'seem', 'irrelevant', 'director', 'decision', 'downplay', 'climax', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'little', 'disappointing', 'repressed', 'emotional', 'level', 'rest', 'film', 'initial', 'earthquake', 'sequence', 'are', 'reminded', 'slightly', 'awkward', 'memorial', 'ending', 'film', 'devastating', 'heart.Aftershock', 'structural', 'weaknesses', 'magnificent', 'heart-rending', 'story', 'lot', 'legs', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'like', 'kind', 'thing']",N/A
