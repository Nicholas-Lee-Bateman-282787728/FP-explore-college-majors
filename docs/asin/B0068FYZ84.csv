1513270,A3QTP2CI1BDV0M,B0068FYZ84,"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark""","[0, 0]","""Babe"" is one of the most original and heartwarming movies ever made,  It is the story of a pig (Babe) who, by way of a carnival raffle, ends up on a farm owned by Arthur Hoggett and his wife Esme.  The pig's fate, from the outset, is surely to be the main course for the upcoming Christmas supper,  but fate sometimes takes an unexpected turn ... and so it is with Babe's.As the story unfolds, Babe's innocence and good intentions win over the other animals on the farm (all the animals can talk).  He becomes friends with ""Ferdinand"" (a duck that wants to be a rooster), ""Ma"" (the elder ""matriarch"" sheep of the large sheet herd on the farm), and ""Fly"" (one of two sheepdogs on the farm).  Fly, in particular, shows great kindness toward Babe, and Babe responds by ... wanting to be a sheepdog.  Farmer Hoggett notices this, and he gives Babe a chance.  His wife, his daughter, and his son-in-law all think Arthur is crazy ... and they laugh at him ... but Farmer Hoggett gradually becomes convinced that Babe is a special sheep-herding animal ... and he enters his pig in the National Sheepdog Trials (competition) ... without his wife's knowledge and without telling the competition's officials that his ""entry"" is a pig.The scene at the competition is believably ... very believably ... chaotic, as Arthur has to persevere through the disapproval of the officials and the raucous laughter of the crowd ... to get Babe out onto the sheep herding course.  Mrs. Hoggett is watching too ... in horror and disbelief ... on a TV in a hotel room.  Her reactions to the embarrassment her husband is causing are priceless.  But Babe come through (in the competition) and everybody watching is reduced to silence.  It is a wonderful wonderful ending.Based on the book ""The Sheep-Pig"" by children's author Dick King-Smith, the screenplay for ""Babe"" is superbly crafted to be realistic and believable (given the fanciful nature of the story) ... and fun.  The narration, which is like a caring tour guide throughout the movie, carries the audience through this emotionally touching story using the most concise and easy-to-understand sentences possible.  The voice performers (for the animal voices) were well cast and they do an excellent job.  The live actors too are excellent.  James Cromwell is wonderful as the sparing-of-words Farmer Hoggett.  His acting style is realistic, understated, precise, and ... effective.  Magda Szubanski who plays the pretentious and bossy Mrs. Hoggett, makes her character funny and non-threatening.But it is the message that the movie gives that is perhaps its most endearing quality. ""Never give up on your dreams ... even if they are unconventional.""  ""Babe"" is a wonderfully unconventional movie.  It makes me wish there were more like it.",5,Delighful.
