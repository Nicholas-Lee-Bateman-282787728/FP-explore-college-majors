Originally, I also thought it was slow and not very challenging, but when I got it out again recently, I went as heavy as I could handle and got a fantastic workout. The first workout goes through all the moves and you can perfect your form. The second one has combined kettlebell moves with short cardio intervals (this one is similar to Amy's other kettlebell DVD but not quite as demanding). It is a fantastic DVD. Well done instruction where you don't get hurt as a beginner, but grows with you beyond that. It really gives you a chance to go heavy without dread factor.",5,Beyond Beginner,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,607,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'time', 'Originally', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'slow', 'not', 'very', 'challenging', 'when', 'got', 'out', 'again', 'recently', 'went', 'as', 'heavy', 'could', 'handle', 'got', 'fantastic', 'workout', 'first', 'workout', 'moves', 'can', 'perfect', 'form', 'second', 'one', 'combined', 'kettlebell', 'short', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'one', 'similar', 'Amy', 'other', 'kettlebell', 'DVD', 'not', 'quite', 'demanding', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'Well', 'done', 'instruction', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hurt', 'beginner', 'really', 'chance', 'go', 'heavy', 'dread', 'factor']",Absolute Beginners: Kettlebell 3 in 1 With Amy Bento

1225894,A3AHDR4F2J7YXX,B001P5YIQQ,"Caliaha ""Caliaha""","[24, 26]","I have been looking for a good kettle bell workout after getting into kettle bell'n with Amy Dixon's ""Give Me 10"" workout video where she introduced kettle bells in her extra section. It was so much fun and so different than my other in-home workouts.Okay, first off, you need to make sure to get a heavy enough kettle bell. For women, the recommended weight is 20 lbs!!! If you use a 5 or 10 lb kettle bell, you won't get the true benefits of the exercise routine. I am a 40+ women and I'm starting this workout with a 15 lb. kettle bell. This is the MINIMUM weight I would recommend. I'm a little wimpy on upper-body strength, although the real workout is lower body. The whole concept of the workout is swinging the heavy kettle bell around. Don't start with anything less than 15 lbs. 20-30 lbs. which will give you the ultimate challenge and you will build tremendous strength.The video is excellent. It is made up of 3 sections. The first section is a tutorial on how to swing and handle the heavy weight. There are six exercises you will learn and are used throughout sections 2 and 3. Amy Bento demonstrates and explains each swing very well and this section gives you the opportunity to practice each of the exercises and prepare you for the 2 other sections.The second section is for beginners, yet is quite challenging. You will feel like you really worked your muscles and it gets your heart rate going too. Even though she leads by herself (there are no other students), she makes it fun, challenging, and interesting. You basically move from each of the 6 exercises in a fast paced manner. The routine is 30 minutes and will work out all your muscles and get cardio work toolThe third section uses the same set on exercises, but she combines them into a series of swings for an even more challenging workout. In between each portion of kettle bell exercises, Amy adds cardio moves to keep your heart rate high. This is definitely a challenging workout!!!My only grip on the workout is the stretching section. At the end of each section there is a very brief stretch that is unique for each workout. Then there is a section added to the end that is identical in each workout. This may be a style of Tammie Lee Webb who produced this video and also does this stretch repeat on her video. It would be better if they added a unique and longer stretch routine to complete the workout.Overall, this is an excellent video for the beginner and will turn you into an intermediate kettle beller in no time if you stick to it!!!",5,"Wanna learn kettle bell'in, then this is the video for you!!!",1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,2531,"['have', 'been', 'looking', 'good', 'kettle', 'bell', 'getting', 'kettle', 'bell', 'n', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'Give', 'Me', '10', 'workout', 'video', 'where', 'introduced', 'kettle', 'bells', 'extra', 'section', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'so', 'different', 'other', 'in-home', 'workouts.Okay', 'first', 'off', 'need', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'heavy', 'enough', 'kettle', 'bell', 'women', 'recommended', 'weight', '20', 'lbs', 'use', '5', '10', 'lb', 'kettle', 'bell', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'true', 'benefits', 'exercise', 'routine', 'am', '40+', 'women', ""'m"", 'starting', 'workout', '15', 'lb', 'kettle', 'bell', 'MINIMUM', 'weight', 'would', 'recommend', ""'m"", 'little', 'wimpy', 'upper-body', 'strength', 'real', 'workout', 'lower', 'body', 'whole', 'concept', 'workout', 'swinging', 'heavy', 'kettle', 'bell', 'around', 'Do', ""n't"", 'start', 'anything', 'less', '15', 'lbs', '20-30', 'lbs', 'will', 'give', 'ultimate', 'challenge', 'will', 'build', 'tremendous', 'strength.The', 'video', 'excellent', 'made', '3', 'sections', 'first', 'section', 'tutorial', 'how', 'swing', 'handle', 'heavy', 'weight', 'are', 'six', 'exercises', 'will', 'learn', 'are', 'used', 'sections', '2', '3', 'Amy', 'Bento', 'swing', 'very', 'well', 'section', 'opportunity', 'practice', 'exercises', 'prepare', '2', 'other', 'sections.The', 'second', 'section', 'beginners', 'yet', 'quite', 'challenging', 'will', 'feel', 'really', 'worked', 'muscles', 'heart', 'rate', 'going', 'too', 'Even', 'herself', 'are', 'other', 'students', 'fun', 'challenging', 'interesting', 'basically', 'move', '6', 'exercises', 'fast', 'paced', 'manner', 'routine', '30', 'minutes', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'muscles', 'get', 'cardio', 'work', 'toolThe', 'third', 'section', 'same', 'set', 'exercises', 'series', 'swings', 'even', 'more', 'challenging', 'workout', 'portion', 'kettle', 'bell', 'exercises', 'Amy', 'cardio', 'moves', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'high', 'definitely', 'challenging', 'workout', 'only', 'grip', 'workout', 'stretching', 'section', 'end', 'section', 'very', 'brief', 'stretch', 'unique', 'workout', 'Then', 'section', 'added', 'end', 'identical', 'workout', 'may', 'be', 'style', 'Tammie', 'Lee', 'Webb', 'who', 'produced', 'video', 'also', 'stretch', 'repeat', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'added', 'unique', 'longer', 'stretch', 'routine', 'complete', 'workout.Overall', 'excellent', 'video', 'beginner', 'will', 'turn', 'intermediate', 'kettle', 'beller', 'time', 'stick']",Absolute Beginners: Kettlebell 3 in 1 With Amy Bento
1225895,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B001P5YIQQ,Colleen M. Schneider,"[255, 259]","I consider myself a beginner,as I am brand new to kettlebell, but not new to fitness workouts.  I work out daily with many types of workouts (pilates, yoga, dance, cardio, step, etc).  I felt Absolute Beginner would give me what I needed to learn the basics and was interested because it also included an intermediate workout as well.The cuing is good, she lets you know what you should and should not be doing so that you know proper form,so for that I felt it was worth it.  The tutorial section instructed 6 basic moves and took about 10 minutes.The beginner portion was about 20 minutes and you practice moves you learned in the tutorial section.The intermediate portion was also about 20 minutes and I thought might have a bit more moves, but the main difference seemed to be that she added in a bit of extra cardio between the toning moves (such as simulating a jump rope, etc).  Maybe I expected a little more, or maybe I am not quite as beginner as I think I am.Both workouts end with a two minute stretch that basically stretches the glutes and hip flexors. I was a little surprised that there wasn't a bit more, but then again, the workout is only 20 minutes, so maybe that is about right.I started with a 7 lb. weight and felt the moves were very easy to follow and I could build up later with a heavier kettlebell as I feel the need.As far as the instructor, she absolutely knows her stuff, but I can't say I am a huge fan, she is a bit too chatty for my tastes and a little bit over the top on the motivational, ""you can do it"" stuff.The music was not my idea of great workout music-which unless I'm doing a dance workout should basically just be a little background, not an urban kind of sound with sirens in some spots.  So, musicwise, also, a little over the top.So, who is this workout for?  I would say those that are fitness beginners (not just kettlebell, but fitness in general), older exercisers (I'm middle aged, so I mean older than that...) or those that have lifted no weights and are starting from the ground, ground floor.I borrowed this one from the library, and I have decided I would outgrow this much too soon, so will not be purchasing, but if you fall into one of the categories above, this may be just the ticket to start a fitness regime that will work your body, and give you a little cardio from someone who knows the ropes.",3,Absolutely perfect for certain types of beginners....,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,2362,"['consider', 'beginner', 'am', 'brand', 'new', 'kettlebell', 'not', 'new', 'fitness', 'workouts', 'work', 'out', 'daily', 'many', 'types', 'workouts', 'pilates', 'yoga', 'dance', 'cardio', 'step', 'etc', 'felt', 'Absolute', 'Beginner', 'would', 'give', 'what', 'needed', 'learn', 'basics', 'was', 'interested', 'also', 'included', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'well.The', 'cuing', 'good', 'know', 'what', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'doing', 'know', 'proper', 'form', 'so', 'felt', 'was', 'worth', 'tutorial', 'section', 'instructed', '6', 'basic', 'moves', 'took', 'about', '10', 'minutes.The', 'beginner', 'portion', 'was', '20', 'minutes', 'practice', 'moves', 'learned', 'tutorial', 'section.The', 'intermediate', 'portion', 'was', 'also', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'moves', 'main', 'difference', 'seemed', 'be', 'added', 'bit', 'extra', 'cardio', 'toning', 'moves', 'such', 'simulating', 'jump', 'rope', 'etc', 'Maybe', 'expected', 'little', 'more', 'maybe', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'beginner', 'think', 'am.Both', 'workouts', 'end', 'two', 'minute', 'stretch', 'basically', 'glutes', 'hip', 'flexors', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'bit', 'more', 'then', 'again', 'workout', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'maybe', 'right.I', 'started', '7', 'lb', 'weight', 'felt', 'moves', 'were', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'could', 'build', 'up', 'later', 'heavier', 'kettlebell', 'feel', 'need.As', 'far', 'instructor', 'absolutely', 'stuff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'bit', 'too', 'chatty', 'tastes', 'little', 'bit', 'top', 'motivational', 'can', 'do', 'stuff.The', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'idea', 'great', 'music-which', ""'m"", 'doing', 'dance', 'workout', 'should', 'basically', 'just', 'be', 'little', 'background', 'not', 'urban', 'kind', 'sound', 'sirens', 'spots', 'So', 'musicwise', 'also', 'little', 'top.So', 'who', 'workout', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'fitness', 'beginners', 'not', 'just', 'kettlebell', 'fitness', 'general', 'older', 'exercisers', ""'m"", 'middle', 'aged', 'mean', 'older', 'have', 'lifted', 'weights', 'are', 'starting', 'ground', 'ground', 'floor.I', 'borrowed', 'one', 'library', 'have', 'decided', 'would', 'outgrow', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'purchasing', 'fall', 'one', 'categories', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'ticket', 'start', 'fitness', 'regime', 'will', 'work', 'body', 'give', 'little', 'cardio', 'someone', 'who', 'ropes']",Absolute Beginners: Kettlebell 3 in 1 With Amy Bento
