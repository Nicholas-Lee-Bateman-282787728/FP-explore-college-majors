1693184,A1K88BHP4PIDSL,B00I0VTPYI,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]",My 3 year old wants to watch it all the time over and over. I was suprised how cheap the video is for a new show. Anyone with a toddler (boy or girl) should get this. It as helped me clean and cook dinner a few times lol. I also like how the DVD keeps playing over and over so I don't have push play every time it plays threw.,5,I also like how the DVD keeps playing over and over so ...,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,326,"['3', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'time', 'was', 'suprised', 'how', 'cheap', 'video', 'new', 'show', 'Anyone', 'toddler', 'boy', 'girl', 'should', 'get', 'helped', 'clean', 'cook', 'dinner', 'few', 'times', 'lol', 'also', 'how', 'DVD', 'playing', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'push', 'play', 'time', 'threw']",Paw Patrol

1693186,A2EDCKTCXYM5CB,B00I0VTPYI,Doc Savage,"[0, 0]","My kids love this show. When I first saw it advertised last year, I set it to record since it stars dogs and big trucks, two things little kids can't get enough of. Sure enough, they adore the pups from Paw Patrol. The show's not bad, either. It's cute and teaches lessons with a light touch. I only wish they would release more episodes at a faster pace, and let me get them on DVD as well.And good grief, put out the toys already!!!!!",5,Only complaint: Release more episodes on DVD!,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,436,"['kids', 'love', 'show', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'advertised', 'last', 'year', 'set', 'record', 'dogs', 'big', 'trucks', 'two', 'things', 'little', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Sure', 'enough', 'adore', 'pups', 'Paw', 'Patrol', 'show', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'cute', 'teaches', 'lessons', 'light', 'touch', 'only', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'more', 'episodes', 'faster', 'pace', 'let', 'get', 'DVD', 'well.And', 'good', 'grief', 'put', 'out', 'toys', 'already']",Paw Patrol
