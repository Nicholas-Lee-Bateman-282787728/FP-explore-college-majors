Thank goodness it was this series and not other, really gory, horrifying-nightmare-inducing ones. The stories are set up as &#34;campfire stories&#34; that kids make up and tell their friends. Yes, there are spooky features and usually, a &#34;are you sure that's just make believe?&#34; element that pops up at the end of the campfire when the kids break up to go home. His only caveat was to watch out for the last episode in each season- they &#34;are totally scary and mom, you have to watch it with me!&#34; He's actually turned off the last episode once it got started and waited for me to sit down and watch the rest of it with him.

Along with Salute Your Shorts, pete and pete, all that, etc. And it's great that they've made them available.... sort of. The problem with these releases is that they're out of order. And when I say out of order, they are completely random from all 6 seasons...I don't mind if they decides to release them in volumes, but I just wish that they would have released them in order and by season.ALSO Why release the full volume, but not make the entire volume available?!?!?! I enjoy just purchasing the entire season (or volume in this case). There is 1 episode that is unavailable, thus I cannot purchase the season in its entirety.
