Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[0, 0]","Cry Blood, Apache was released in theaters in September of 1970 starring Jody McCrea, Marie Gahva, and Dan Kemp. Cry Apache Blood was a 1970 western film directed by Jack Starrett and assistant director Robert Tessier. The film released by Liberty Entertainment was from an original story by Harold Roberts with a screenplay by Sean MacGregor and has been released as part of a 20-movie DVD pack titled Mean Guns by Mill Creek Entertainment.SUMMARY: A party of five men discovers gold in a small Apache camp. They murder everyone there except for one young woman, who they keep alive hoping she'll lead them to more gold. Only Pitcalin among the five men shows kindness to the prisoner. An Apache brave who was away from the camp discovers the massacre and buries the dead. Then he tracks the murderers and brings slow but steady vengeance upon them.QUESTIONS: Did the Apache Brave catch up to the five men? Why did they let the one woman live? Where was the gold that the men were looking for?NOW MY THOUGHTS ON THIS MOVIE: This movie was boring right from the start. Sure, it was a western; however, it lacked what makes western good. Cows and gunfights! There was no real action in this movie. There wasn't a story line that kept you on the edge of your sit. There was no theme to keep your interest. The main thing this movie was missing was a leading lady. There wasn't any! Therefore, with that in mind, I give this movie 2 weasel stars and that was being kind at best",2,BORING,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1474,"['Cry', 'Blood', 'Apache', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'September', '1970', 'starring', 'Jody', 'McCrea', 'Marie', 'Gahva', 'Dan', 'Kemp', 'Cry', 'Apache', 'Blood', 'was', '1970', 'western', 'film', 'directed', 'Jack', 'Starrett', 'assistant', 'director', 'Robert', 'Tessier', 'film', 'released', 'Liberty', 'Entertainment', 'was', 'original', 'story', 'Harold', 'Roberts', 'screenplay', 'Sean', 'MacGregor', 'been', 'released', 'part', '20-movie', 'DVD', 'pack', 'titled', 'Mean', 'Guns', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment.SUMMARY', 'A', 'party', 'five', 'men', 'discovers', 'gold', 'small', 'Apache', 'camp', 'murder', 'everyone', 'there', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'keep', 'alive', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'lead', 'more', 'gold', 'Only', 'Pitcalin', 'five', 'men', 'kindness', 'prisoner', 'Apache', 'brave', 'who', 'was', 'away', 'camp', 'massacre', 'dead', 'Then', 'murderers', 'brings', 'slow', 'steady', 'vengeance', 'them.QUESTIONS', 'Did', 'Apache', 'Brave', 'catch', 'up', 'five', 'men', 'Why', 'did', 'let', 'one', 'woman', 'live', 'Where', 'was', 'gold', 'men', 'were', 'looking', 'NOW', 'MY', 'THOUGHTS', 'ON', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'right', 'start', 'Sure', 'was', 'western', 'however', 'lacked', 'what', 'western', 'good', 'Cows', 'gunfights', 'was', 'real', 'action', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'story', 'line', 'kept', 'edge', 'sit', 'was', 'theme', 'keep', 'interest', 'main', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'leading', 'lady', 'was', ""n't"", 'Therefore', 'mind', 'give', 'movie', '2', 'weasel', 'stars', 'was', 'being', 'kind', 'best']",N/A
579346,A12KM32L9JURF6,B00005AWQF,hey_steve,"[4, 4]","The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI release of this film.""Cry Blood, Apache"" was made in 1970 when restrictions on what could be shown on the screen were loosened somewhat. And the results are a mish mash. Joel McCrea who did many fine films is used to open and close the story as the older version of the movies star Jody McCrea (Joel's son). The younger McCrea also produced the film which may be why the elder agreed to appear in it.The story is of the more seedier side of the white man taking over the old west stopping at nothing to achieve their goals. This includes drunkenness, raping, pillaging and killing as we see in the opening act of the film. One young woman survives this initial incident and agrees to show the band of men where some gold is located. Off they go, followed by the girl's brother who wants to exact revenge on the group and rescue his sister.But ""Cry Blood, Apache"" is not just a story about greed and life in the old west. It's also a budding love story between our young Apache woman and the younger McCrea. It's the old captor/captive love story that plays out between the films climax between McCrea and the woman's brother.Filmed in Arizona and at Sequoia National Forest, the scenery is delightful. Quite light on dialogue, the film does hold the interest of the viewer as it moves at a fairly rapid pace. But have no doubt, it's a violent (for the times) movie, that would have looked at home at a drive-in for a B feature.The print used for the transfer is fairly decent, not too many pops and scratches, although the color is a bit washed. Not a bad film for the money. But! If you are in to cheap entertainment and want some bang for your buck, this film is available from the same company in a 10 pack of westerns called ""The Wild West"" , which will give you hours of entertainment for a low price ...",3,Grade B western with high hopes but hey it's got Joel McCrea,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,1885,"['technical', 'part', 'review', 'Brentwood', 'Home', 'Video', 'BCI', 'release', 'film', 'Cry', 'Blood', 'Apache', 'was', 'made', '1970', 'when', 'restrictions', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'shown', 'screen', 'were', 'loosened', 'somewhat', 'results', 'are', 'mish', 'mash', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'who', 'did', 'many', 'fine', 'films', 'used', 'open', 'close', 'story', 'older', 'version', 'movies', 'star', 'Jody', 'McCrea', 'Joel', 'son', 'younger', 'McCrea', 'also', 'produced', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'elder', 'agreed', 'appear', 'it.The', 'story', 'more', 'seedier', 'side', 'white', 'man', 'taking', 'over', 'old', 'west', 'stopping', 'nothing', 'achieve', 'goals', 'drunkenness', 'raping', 'pillaging', 'killing', 'see', 'opening', 'act', 'film', 'One', 'young', 'woman', 'initial', 'incident', 'show', 'band', 'men', 'where', 'gold', 'located', 'go', 'followed', 'girl', 'brother', 'who', 'exact', 'revenge', 'group', 'rescue', 'sister.But', 'Cry', 'Blood', 'Apache', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'greed', 'life', 'old', 'west', 'also', 'budding', 'love', 'story', 'young', 'Apache', 'woman', 'younger', 'McCrea', 'old', 'captor/captive', 'love', 'story', 'out', 'films', 'climax', 'McCrea', 'woman', 'brother.Filmed', 'Arizona', 'Sequoia', 'National', 'Forest', 'scenery', 'delightful', 'Quite', 'light', 'dialogue', 'film', 'hold', 'interest', 'viewer', 'fairly', 'rapid', 'pace', 'have', 'doubt', 'violent', 'times', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'home', 'drive-in', 'B', 'feature.The', 'print', 'used', 'transfer', 'fairly', 'decent', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'pops', 'scratches', 'color', 'bit', 'washed', 'Not', 'bad', 'film', 'money', 'are', 'cheap', 'entertainment', 'want', 'bang', 'buck', 'film', 'available', 'same', 'company', '10', 'pack', 'westerns', 'called', 'Wild', 'West', 'will', 'give', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'low', 'price']",N/A

The production value is low and the photography is very basic, but the overall simple story is good. Long before CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery) and fancy stunts. Directed by Jack Starrett as a director who went on to do TV shows like Dukes Of Hazard and Hill Street Blues.  The films stars Joel McCrea as the Apache Indian with a mind set on vengeance.The story is that of one Apache Indian seeking revenge on his murderous white man attackers who maimed, murdered and raped his family. They also kidnap his wife and take her along with them on their trek westward. The white cowboys are sought after one after the other and then mercilessly tortured and killed in his act of revenge.The acting is very basic and the movie over-all is not much to talk about, but it is the story that keeps this relatively short film interesting. Obviously all shot on location; the film does look gritty and real.I would not recommend this for the whole family, but I know it tales one side of a bitter story about the struggles out Native American Indians had hen the white man tried to take over the west.
