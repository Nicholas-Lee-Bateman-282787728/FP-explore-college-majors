508890,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00000K0EJ,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 5]","Okay, okay I `ll back off a little on my remark that on the basis of two recently reviewed Alfred Hitchcock films, The Wrong Man and I Confess, apparently the late thriller director had less that total admiration for the cops, the New York City and Quebec City cops anyway. Yah, the cops, the London cops, got it right, got it right up to the big step off as they collared their man, oops woman, wrapped it up tight, and let the long arm of justice take its course. But see there was dame involved, a femme fatale to boot so you can hardly blame a guy like me (or Hitchcock's London cops for that matter under other circumstances) for not seeing what was clear as day in front of us. But it was a close thing anyway before the end, and some pretty big time lawyers, oops, barristers got egg on their faces before it was all over.I better explain (and explain fast before some irate cop gives me, poor me, the third  degree for complaining about their police procedures). See this mysterious woman, this femme fatale there is no other way to call it discreetly, was married to a mucky-mucky blind (age and infirmity blind) English rich gentleman named Paradine who wound up very, very dead one night having ingested a poisoned drink. Naturally his ever-loving wife, Mrs. Paradine (played by Alida Valli), young, fetching, restless, of indeterminate background, and, oh yah, a femme fatale, if I didn't mention that before was the easy choice to step off for the caper. Mrs. Paradine though was not without financial resources and could and did hire the best up and coming  criminal defense lawyer around town, oops again, barrister, Tony Keane(played by Gregory Peck),  a very, very married barrister by the way. Married to an upper crust woman (played by Anne Todd) who was perhaps just a bit too stiff upper lip and earnest when all is said and done.Naturally when a femme is on the prowl every guy within ten miles is fair game and, of course, Tony forgets every law 101 thing that got him to where he was including taking a big fall for Mrs. Paradine once she got her hooks into him. Those hooks included Tony, against all reason and evidence, trying to set up Colonel Paradine's valet, Andre, as the fall guy (played by Louis Jourdan).That proved to be Tony's undoing as Mrs. Paradine, turning out to be a good femme, or my idea of a good femme, won't hear of letting Andre take the fall, especially after Tony has grilled Andre on the stand in court and as a result Andre commits suicide. That knowledge unravels Mrs. Paradine who admits in open court, against all reason since that all male jury was also swayable, that Andre was her lover and that she, and she alone, murdered her husband to run off with him.Build those gallows high, very high indeed. Naturally the  very earnest  Mrs. Keane took her Tony back, or wanted to but you can see, see as clear as day, how even big time lawyers, oops once more, barristers  could have gotten thrown off course when a femme is in the room. So what do expect of poor amateur like me who was secretly pulling for her just like I do for every femme, good or bad. But that too was a close thing.",4,"Tony, Watch Out",1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,3142,"['Okay', 'okay', 'll', 'back', 'off', 'little', 'remark', 'basis', 'two', 'recently', 'reviewed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'Confess', 'apparently', 'late', 'thriller', 'director', 'had', 'less', 'total', 'admiration', 'cops', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Quebec', 'City', 'anyway', 'Yah', 'cops', 'London', 'cops', 'got', 'right', 'got', 'right', 'up', 'big', 'step', 'off', 'collared', 'man', 'woman', 'wrapped', 'up', 'tight', 'let', 'long', 'arm', 'justice', 'take', 'course', 'see', 'was', 'dame', 'involved', 'femme', 'fatale', 'boot', 'so', 'can', 'hardly', 'blame', 'guy', 'Hitchcock', 'London', 'cops', 'matter', 'other', 'circumstances', 'not', 'seeing', 'what', 'was', 'clear', 'day', 'front', 'was', 'close', 'thing', 'anyway', 'end', 'pretty', 'big', 'time', 'lawyers', 'oops', 'barristers', 'got', 'egg', 'was', 'over.I', 'better', 'explain', 'explain', 'fast', 'irate', 'cop', 'poor', 'third', 'degree', 'complaining', 'police', 'procedures', 'See', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'femme', 'fatale', 'other', 'way', 'call', 'discreetly', 'was', 'married', 'mucky-mucky', 'blind', 'age', 'infirmity', 'blind', 'English', 'rich', 'gentleman', 'named', 'Paradine', 'who', 'wound', 'up', 'very', 'very', 'dead', 'one', 'night', 'having', 'ingested', 'poisoned', 'drink', 'Naturally', 'ever-loving', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'played', 'Alida', 'Valli', 'young', 'fetching', 'restless', 'indeterminate', 'background', 'oh', 'yah', 'femme', 'fatale', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'before', 'was', 'easy', 'choice', 'step', 'off', 'caper', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'was', 'not', 'financial', 'resources', 'could', 'did', 'hire', 'best', 'up', 'coming', 'criminal', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'town', 'oops', 'again', 'barrister', 'Tony', 'Keane', 'played', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'very', 'very', 'married', 'barrister', 'way', 'Married', 'upper', 'crust', 'woman', 'played', 'Anne', 'Todd', 'who', 'was', 'perhaps', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'earnest', 'when', 'said', 'done.Naturally', 'when', 'femme', 'prowl', 'guy', 'ten', 'miles', 'fair', 'game', 'course', 'Tony', 'law', '101', 'thing', 'got', 'where', 'was', 'including', 'taking', 'big', 'fall', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'once', 'got', 'hooks', 'included', 'Tony', 'reason', 'evidence', 'trying', 'set', 'up', 'Colonel', 'Paradine', 'valet', 'Andre', 'fall', 'guy', 'played', 'Louis', 'Jourdan', 'proved', 'be', 'Tony', 'undoing', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'femme', 'idea', 'good', 'femme', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'letting', 'Andre', 'take', 'fall', 'especially', 'Tony', 'grilled', 'Andre', 'stand', 'court', 'result', 'Andre', 'commits', 'suicide', 'knowledge', 'unravels', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'who', 'open', 'court', 'reason', 'male', 'jury', 'was', 'also', 'swayable', 'Andre', 'was', 'lover', 'alone', 'murdered', 'husband', 'run', 'off', 'him.Build', 'gallows', 'high', 'very', 'high', 'indeed', 'Naturally', 'very', 'earnest', 'Mrs.', 'Keane', 'took', 'Tony', 'back', 'wanted', 'can', 'see', 'see', 'as', 'clear', 'day', 'how', 'even', 'big', 'time', 'lawyers', 'once', 'more', 'barristers', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'thrown', 'off', 'course', 'when', 'femme', 'room', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'poor', 'amateur', 'who', 'was', 'secretly', 'pulling', 'just', 'do', 'femme', 'good', 'bad', 'too', 'was', 'close', 'thing']",N/A

Of course, the other side of that coin is that if it wasn't a Hitchcock film, perhaps it wouldn't be remembered at all. Another reviewer loves it even with the sound turned off, just for the camera work and lighting. Well, sorry, but in my book this is still a mediocre movie. Great acting and clever production can't make a great movie out of a so-so story, and a so-so story is exactly what you have here. The dialogue may be snappy, but the plot has few, if any, surprises. Besides clever production, Hitchcock is known for suspense and unforeseen twists in his stories. &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; has some tension, but the end is not surprising and it's hard to generate a lot of sympathy for the characters.

Not even that beautiful and enthralling voice of his could make it come to life.Throughout I kept picking up the jacket, searching out Alfred Hitchcock's name, just to make sure I hadn't mistaken it for his movie when it wasn't. There was no tension, no mystery, no thrill. But instead, as another reviewer had mentioned, it was almost outright silly. There is no way, realistically, that Peck's character would have become so smitten with his, in my opinion, not so attractive client in so short a time. Yes, I know, we are suppose to suspend some belief in these things, but c'mon. This is asking a bit much.

The leads aside, Peck and Valli are both good, there is Charles Laughton, Ann Todd, Louis Jourdan and Ethel Barrymore, who received an Academy Award nomination. The magic of Alfred Hitchcock was also in his ability to work with even the weakest script and make a compelling film, if not a great film. In the same interview he says much the same for the script of ""I Confess"" with Montgomery Clift. Even the story for ""Vertigo"". one of his best works and my all time favorite, he admits had some real problems that he felt were never completely solved. Hitchcock was an artist and made great films, inspite of sometimes getting handed a less than desirable script or having to cast a studio player under contract.

On the surface it appears to be about a courtroom murder case where the accused Misses Paradine (Alida Valli) is defended by barrister (Gregory Peck) who becomes infatuated by here statuesque beauty and in doing so undermines his marriage to Ann Todd. Valli is accused of murdering her husband who we never see in person but only in a portrait. We never actually see the murder on screen.  We must rely on the testimony of the witnesses to come to some conclusion about Mister Paradine's demise. Louis Jourdan is the late Mister Paradine's manservant. His relationship to both Mister and Misses Paradine leaves many questions for the viewer. Jourdan who delivers one of his best performances expertly plays this pivotal character. The film is really about relationships ending and evolving and to a degree about relationships that are imagined. Relationships end or are put on hold. Relationships reveal sharp realities for the central characters and they must come to terms with their own conduct. Other relationships such as Charels Laughton and his wife Ethel Barrymore have remained static and listless. They each fulfill what is left of a relationship that should never have been. The submissive Barrymore dutifully endures the bullying nature of Laughton, the presiding judge. Being a David O. Selznick's picture the production is lavish yet somehow it is overshadowed by the bleak nature of the screenplay. The production values are almost a counterpoint to the story and to actress Valli's rather sullen performance, which remains a bit of an enigma.  Gregory Peck's performance is very good. Because of his basic good nature the viewer feels for his flawed character and his realization of this that will no doubt come by the end of the film.

Obsessive behavior can be destructive as is seen in the relationship that Peck has with his loyal wife portrayed by Ann Todd. However, the greatest role and performance in this film is in the form of Louis Jourdan. Jourdan is an unwavering curiosity in his quixotic role as Mr. Paradine's manservant. His relationship with Mrs. Paradine and her late husband remains a conundrum. Jourdan's performance as a man of steadfast loyalty to both duty and passion is one of brilliance.

This star known best for her work in ""Miracle of the Bells""  (the story of a brilliant actress who plays Joan of Arc, and then dies with that being her only film), is not just a striking beauty.  Unlike many of the glamourous, beautiful stars of the 40s, she shares with us a complex and intelligent internal life.  We know that we will only know 10% of what is going on in her head, but we see the wheels turning through her eyes.  It is this quality which makes this film come alive, and it is a perfect vehicle for her.Gregory Peck (although slightly miscast - not old enough yet to be a middle aged lawyer in mid-life crisis) with his open accessibility to the audience, and his emotional availability is the perfect foil for Valli.  This is perhaps one of his most complex roles, and possibly his sexiest.I disagree with the amazon editorial review that this film is bound by it's setting.  Hitchcock enjoied the challenge of making films in small, confined sets.  The direction here makes the most of Valli's talents, and there are many incredible shots.  The entrance of young Louis Jordan into the courtroom behind Valli is an incredible, captivating 300 degree follow shot.  This shot physicallizes the chemistry between them without them ever looking at each other.  It is worth mentioning here that this film also introduced Louis Jordan.  In a rare performance using an American accent, he is raw and brooding and beautiful.  He does not have the mannerisms that lessened his later performances, he was not yet a star.It is interesting that in this film, Hitchcock has his usual blonde beauty (Ann Todd) protrayed as conventional and staid.  We understand why Gregory Peck would both love her and be bored by her once he meets Valli.  He heightens this by contrasting their acting styles as well.  Todd's acting style, especially her diction, is old school, while Valli is something new entirely.  As a Hitchcock fan, I feel this is one of his best films, ranking with VERTIGO, NOTORIOUS, SUSPICION and I CONFESS as one of my favorites.  (It is worth mentioning for the Hitchcock fan, that this film uses many of the same music cues that were used in NOTORIOUS.)I hope the DVD companies will produce a good version of this with commentary.

Just some thoughts on this movie...The Paradine Case (1947) is an Alfred Hitchcock drama that stars Gregory Peck, Ann Todd, Alida Valli (Miss Tanner in ""Suspiria""), Louis Jourdan, Ethel Barrymore, and Charles Laughton.  This courtroom drama is a different kind of Hitchcock movie in that it's very slow moving with lots of dialogue and no action.  This doesn't mean it's a bad movie, it just means that it won't satisfy a lot of viewers who are used to the trademark Hitchcock elements of suspense and action.  It does, of course, have the trademark glamour that's present in the vast majority of Hitchcock's movies.  But the movie is rather dull most of the time.One thing this movie has going for it is that it's beautifully shot, with great cinematography, camerawork, lighting, atmosphere, and sets.  The picture quality is great as well.  This was Hitchcock's last collaboration with producer David O. Selznick (the others were ""Rebecca"" and ""Spellbound"").  There's something about the movies where Hitchcock and Selznick teamed up - they seem to have a slightly different feel to them and an extra rich dark atmosphere.  The musical score by Franz Waxman is decent.  The cast is great as well, with many big name actors, and Alida Valli is nice to look at.  The acting is also great.If you're a Hitchcock completeist, then see this movie and buy it as well.  If you're not a completeist, this isn't 100% necessary viewing.

He soon begins to believe that anyone as lovely as she must also possess a spotless soul, and in no way could have committed this crime.Alida Valli plays his devoted, intuitive wife who early on senses his obsession with Mrs. Paradine.

508905,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00000K0EJ,Kevin Killian,"[43, 45]","Alida Valli didn't make very many pictures in the USA, but the ones she did are without exception worth seeing.In Italy, of course, she is as important to the indigenous cinema as Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida put together.  But here is the USA, she starred in a mere handful of pictures, and we remember her mainly via her connection to David Selznick, for whom she made THE THIRD MAN and THE PARADINE CASE.  THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS and WALK SOFTLY, STRANGER are also worth seeing.  In THE PARADINE CASE, she is on trial for murdering her husband in a stuffy British courtroom, to which her sultry and exotic beauty is continually being counterpointed.  She is a bird in a gilded cage all right, literally and figuratively.  Gregory Peck falls hard for her, and it's watching how low he goes that makes this film one of Hitchcock's best.  He even quarrels with his wife, the cold, perfect Ann Todd, and makes it plain to her and to everyone in their bourgeois social circle that he has fallen in love with his client, thus breaking all the rules in one fell swoop.He begins to suspect that Valli has been framed, and he begins to suspect Louis Jourdan, Paradine's handsome manservant, of an illicit interest in his master's wife.  The scenes between Peck and Jourdan are fiery and full of passion.  Each of them is fighting for his life and honor.  There is as well an erotic charge between the two of them.  In a sense Peck is representing the colonialist who seeks authenticity by embroiling himself in the lives and bodies of a darker and more obviously sexed people, whether they be Italian or French.  He gets slapped down for his efforts.Even if you've seen THE PARADINE CASE fifty times, there's always something fresh to watch, whether it's Charles Coburn acting especially kinky, or Ann Todd from THE SEVENTH VEIL acting masochistic one more time.  But most of all the movie is trying to make us see Valli as a new Garbo, who had retired from the screen and whom Selznick believed we would swallow Valli as a successor to.  In my opinion, she's greater than Garbo by a country mile.",5,Valli Victorious,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,2098,"['Alida', 'Valli', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'many', 'pictures', 'USA', 'ones', 'did', 'are', 'exception', 'worth', 'seeing.In', 'Italy', 'course', 'as', 'important', 'indigenous', 'cinema', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'Gina', 'Lollobrigida', 'put', 'together', 'here', 'USA', 'starred', 'mere', 'handful', 'pictures', 'remember', 'mainly', 'connection', 'David', 'Selznick', 'whom', 'made', 'THE', 'THIRD', 'MAN', 'THE', 'PARADINE', 'CASE', 'THE', 'MIRACLE', 'THE', 'BELLS', 'WALK', 'SOFTLY', 'STRANGER', 'are', 'also', 'worth', 'seeing', 'THE', 'PARADINE', 'CASE', 'trial', 'murdering', 'husband', 'stuffy', 'British', 'courtroom', 'sultry', 'exotic', 'beauty', 'continually', 'being', 'counterpointed', 'bird', 'gilded', 'cage', 'right', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'hard', 'watching', 'how', 'low', 'film', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'even', 'wife', 'cold', 'perfect', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'plain', 'everyone', 'bourgeois', 'social', 'circle', 'fallen', 'love', 'client', 'thus', 'breaking', 'rules', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop.He', 'begins', 'suspect', 'Valli', 'been', 'framed', 'suspect', 'Louis', 'Jourdan', 'Paradine', 'handsome', 'manservant', 'illicit', 'interest', 'master', 'wife', 'scenes', 'Peck', 'Jourdan', 'are', 'fiery', 'full', 'passion', 'fighting', 'life', 'honor', 'as', 'well', 'erotic', 'charge', 'two', 'sense', 'Peck', 'representing', 'colonialist', 'who', 'authenticity', 'embroiling', 'lives', 'bodies', 'darker', 'more', 'obviously', 'sexed', 'people', 'be', 'Italian', 'French', 'slapped', 'down', 'efforts.Even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'THE', 'PARADINE', 'CASE', 'fifty', 'times', 'always', 'something', 'fresh', 'watch', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'acting', 'especially', 'kinky', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'THE', 'SEVENTH', 'VEIL', 'acting', 'masochistic', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'most', 'movie', 'trying', 'make', 'see', 'Valli', 'new', 'Garbo', 'who', 'had', 'retired', 'screen', 'whom', 'Selznick', 'believed', 'would', 'swallow', 'Valli', 'successor', 'opinion', 'greater', 'Garbo', 'country', 'mile']",N/A
508906,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00000K0EJ,Robert Moore,"[5, 5]","THE PARADINE CASE is widely regarded as the worst of his films made while under contract with David O. Selznick and one of his weakest films during the entire period after leaving England for Hollywood.  Certainly the film is dull and unexciting.  But it truly is not as terrible as one might be led to expect.Most critics blame the film's failings less on Hitchcock than on David O. Selznick.  Although Selznick was responsible for Hitchcock coming to the U.S., having signed him to a seven year contract, they both quickly learned that they had incompatible working styles.  Hitchcock was extremely well-organized, and if the widespread myth that he knew every scene ahead of time is incorrect (Bill Krohn -- who provides with Stephen Rebello the commentary for the film -- dispelled this myth in his superb book HITCHCOCK AT WORK), he did have a very good idea of what he was going to do.  He shot his films sequentially, which is a very unusual practice.  In REBECCA, Hitchcock very quickly realized that Selznick was an interfering producer, and developed a number of mechanisms to keep him at bay, primarily only filming what he deemed necessary for the final film, leaving Selznick with no film with which to work for recreating the film in the editing process.  For the most part after REBECCA, Selznick lent -- at a substantial fee -- Hitchcock out to other studios, so that over the course of their seven-year contract they actually did relatively little work together.  But in THE PARADINE CASE, Selznick was at his interfering best.  It is pretty well known that this film cost as much as GONE WITH THE WIND, primarily through the astonishing number of scenes that Selznick ordered to be reshot and because of the extensive rewrites he undertook.  As a result, Hitchcock rapidly lost interest in the project, except to get it (and his relationship with Selznick) over with as quickly as possible.When you read about the changes that Selznick made to the film, you can get pretty upset and wonder what the film would have been like had Hitchcock gotten his way.  Frankly, the story sounds about the same and I personally doubt that it would have been one of his best films, but from a cinematic standpoint it sounds like it would have been fascinating to look at.  Hitchcock had begun more and more to experiment with long tracking shots, pushing the limitations of the heavy cameras of the time to the breaking point.  He had numerous shots that would have involved extremely long unbroken shots.  Selznick, whose cinematic sensibilities were extremely conservative, killed all the long shots.  The most grating amendment by Selznick comes in the first shot in the film.  A servant carries a tray with drinks on it towards the back of a very upper class dwelling, he opens a door, and in Hitchcock's original cut would have followed him through additional rooms and passageways to the back.  But Selznick jarringly cuts from the servant entering the room to his approaching his mistress, eliminating all the bits in between.This shows the fundamental contrast between Selznick and Hitchcock.  Selznick was obsessed with words; the films that he most fully molded contained endless scenes of dialogue.  Hitchcock was a visual artist.  He preferred to move the story forward with the camera rather than with characters talking to one another.The interesting aspects of the film reside in two things:  the excellent cast and the astonishing camera work.Although Charles Laughton had been absolutely dreadful in Hitchcock's final British period film, JAMAICA INN (Hitchcock often sleepwalked through projects that bored him, like JAMAICA INN or STAGE FRIGHT or DIAL M FOR MURDER, and it isn't an accident that these are among his weakest films -- by the way, had Hitchcock had his way, there would have been even more of a JAMAICA INN quality to THE PARADINE CASE, if he had been successful in getting Robert Newton cast in the Louis Jourdan role -- Newton played the heroic lead in JAMAICA INN, though most Americans will know him as the greatest of all Long John Silver's, from the Disney version of TREASURE ISLAND), he is fascinating here in a small role as a lecherous judge.  The brilliance of the camera work in the film is shown in one great moment involving Laughton.  At a dinner after the men have withdrawn for their cigars, the men enter a room where the women are all sitting.  The camera zooms in on a close up on Laughton looking off to the side and then cuts from him to Ann Todd sitting on a couch, with the camera then zooming in on her bare shoulder for an extreme close up.  It is a brilliant moment, telling the viewer just about everything one needs to know about Laughton's character.  One of my favorite character actors, Charles Coburn, made his only appearance in a Hitchcock film.  Two other actors who appeared in a host of Hitchcock projects either on TV on in film are in it as well, Leo G. Carroll and John Williams (whose performance was largely left on the cutting room floor -- he would return for memorable roles in DIAL M FOR MURDER and TO CATCH A THIEF, and made more appearances on the Hitchcock TV show than any other actor, including several episodes directed by Hitchcock).Despite Selznick's interference and anesthetizing of the entire film, there are some interesting moments in an otherwise exceedingly dull film.  For instance, in the scene in which Latour enters the courtroom to testify, the camera describes an arc in following his entry and course along the back of the courtroom to the witness stand, all while keeping a severe close up on Alida Valli's face.  Then, after his testimony is finished, the camera describes the same shot from his point of view.  There is a great deal of excellent composition in almost every scene.  If one wanted a template for interesting things to do with a camera, this film could provide it.  Visually, this is one of Hitchcock's most interesting films of the forties.  Contentwise, it is one of his dullest.  We can only speculate the degree to which the boring aspects of the film were due to Selznick.  Clearly, the film, already visually arresting, would have been even more interesting from a cinematography point of view.The very long, unbroken shots that Hitchcock so desperately wanted to do in THE PARADINE CASE would find fruition in his next film, his first after leaving Selznick, ROPE.  It was not a terribly interesting film except from a technical standpoint.  Hitchcock would return to long cuts from time to time, most memorably in FRENZY, but never to such an extent.  It would also be a few years before Hitchcock fully found his stride.  But once he did he turned out a long string of astonishing masterpieces.  Here is what I find amazing.  If Hitchcock had never made another film after THE PARADINE CASE, he would be remembered as one of the greatest directors of all time.  But in 1947, at the time of the release of this film, only about four movies would make the list of his ten greatest films -- THE THIRTY NINE STEPS, THE LADY VANISHES, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, and NOTORIOUS.  His best years were still ahead of him.",3,Not nearly as bad as its reputation would lead you to believe,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,7135,"['PARADINE', 'CASE', 'widely', 'regarded', 'worst',

Valli is Mrs. Paradine, and she wants Andre La Tour, so badly she murders her husband and benefactor to remove any and all obstacles standing between her and La Tour. Louis Jourdan is La Tour, and handsome in a sharp, chiseled way; Valli is really something to see, very beautiful and arresting, and the accent further enhances her mysterious image. Gregory Peck, her attorney, falls for her, hard and fast, and is almost sympathetic in his desire to possess her. Ann Todd, a curious mixture of ice and warmth, is steadfast in her loyalty to her husband, and Joan Tetzel is good as her friend and the daughter of Charles Coburn, (I enjoy the banter between Coburn and Tetzel, he is always a joy to watch)who is a colleague of Gregory Peck's. The score by Franz Waxman is one of the stars of the movie, and haunting, as his music always is. The movie is unusual and quieter than the typical Hitchcockian fare, but should not be judged more harshly for that, but taken on it's own merits, which it has in abundance. Charles Laughton (""curious how the convolutions of a walnut resemble those of the human brain..."") is wonderful as the censorious and righteous Judge of the proceedings, and rather an unpleastant bully to his wife, Ethel Barrymore, who seems rather wasted in this weak role as the much maligned wife. She is one of my favorite actresses, but I much prefer her in ""The Spiral Staircase"", a much richer role and one more worthy of her immense talent.

We watch Gregory Peck's character make a fool of himself for an nearly two hours over his beautiful  client, Mrs. Paradine, with whom he is harmlessly infatuated.  Well, it  would have been a harmless infatuation if he weren't such a damn fool..  making sloppy errors that no lawyer, as good as he is supposed to be, would  ever make, no matter how moony and googly eyed he was over his client.  The  dramatic climax of the movie left me thinking, &quot;Was that all?&quot;.  The only high points in The Paradine Case for me were a young and very  good-looking Louis Jordan, and the usual Hitchcock directorial touches; one  scene in particular I found odd and strangely delightful: At one point  Gregory Peck is confronted by Louis Jordan's suspiciously enigmatic  character.  The more they protest they hate each other, the closer they  move toward each other, and the tension and chemistry was so odd I felt  convinced they were either about to tear into each other like wild dogs, or  make out. *laugh*But really, the story is a bit too silly and  melodramatic for my taste.  I found Marnie to be a *much* better film [at  least stylistically, and sloppy 60's psychology I can excuse more easily  than melodrama], and I understand that it's generally panned, while this  gets nothing but praise [from Amazon reviewers, at any rate].

The actors all did fine jobs, and the sense of suspense was good, too.  What I did NOT like was the relationship between Peck's character and Ann Todd's character as his wife.  The way he treats her, the way she keeps making excuses for him - oh, it just frustrated me so much!!  It just felt, to me, demeaning to women and to the role of a wife.  Of course, I appreciate that Todd's character was noble, supportive and loving to a fault, but she is so underappreciated by her husband while he seemingly feels no guilt for any of his actions - ugh, what a jerk! I also felt the ending was very anti-climatic.  Also, am I the only one who found it creepy that Mrs. Paradine had a picture of herself on her headboard??

508910,A3GUNXVYK34085,B00000K0EJ,William F. Flanigan Jr.,"[6, 7]","Nominally an Alfred Hitchcock film, it has egomaniac David O. Selznick's paw prints all over it (and his name, literally, all over the opening credits).  It's surprising he didn't claim he played all the on-screen parts, did the cinematography, and wrote the film score!  Selznick rewrote the script and essentially took full credit as the screenplay writer.  The film was a box office disaster, and the last of Hitchcock's films for Selznick (Hitchcock did not review his contract--wonder why?!).The script plays like a Selznick memo (dull, sappy, and overly wordy) except for the court room scenes which are taught, dramatic, and suspenseful.  These were probably written by Alma Reville (Hitchcock's spouse) which seem to have some how escaped the full impact of the ""Selznick Touch.""  The stellar cast includes Gregory Peck (straining to act older with gray streaks of hair), Alida Valli (stunning and ""presented"" by Selznick), and Ann Todd (who has never looked worse).  Score is by Franz Waxman whose lush and haunting music invokes memories of his earlier scores for REBECCA (1940) and SUSPICION (1941), and helps much to counteract Selznick's tedious, repetitious dialog.  There is more than a hint of homosexuality between the murder victim, a blind Colonel Paradine (never seen except in a painting), and his valet (played by a very young Louis Jourdan ""presented"" by Selznick).Hitchcock appears on-screen leaving a train car (behind Peck) with a cello case.  This is the reverse of his forth-coming cameo in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN (1951).

In ""The Paradine Case"", however, there just isn't enough compelling material to make its ""verdict"" a success.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Mrs. Paradine (Alida Valli), an English women accused of murdering her husband.  When lawyer Anthony Keane (Gregory Peck) is called onto the case and falls for the widow in an instant, however, his ethical responsibilities to the bench are pulled to the fraying point.The number one problem with this movie is that the plot is terribly predictable.  I won't give away any details here, but there are enough hints and innuendos given throughout the film that the verdict that should have been ""shocking"" at the film's climax is rendered relatively inert.  Perhaps such film-making tactics were commonplace in the 1940s and easier for audiences to digest, but more seasoned film fans will find it annoying that nothing in this movie is ever questioned or rendered remotely suspenseful.The other problem with ""Paradine"" is the whole ""love at first sight"" angle between Peck's character and the lead female role.  This is a flimsy plot contrivance that should have been delved into more deeply instead of just accepted in the blink of an eye.  While watching, I wanted to know more about that main relationship, but instead we are just supposed to buy-in from the get-go and, again, not question a thing.About the only redeeming value in this film for me was that the ethical struggles are indeed endearing and important to the law profession.  Those are the issues that the film should have focused on instead of spending so much time on a romance angle that viewers can see will not be surprising in the least come conclusion time.Thus, this is one of Hitch's poorer efforts in my book.  It may be slightly (2.5 stars would be my perfect rating) better than his Cold War stinkers, but lags far behind his thoughtful, suspenseful fare.
