Curious George is one of the few shows we're very happy to let her watch and, together with Clifford, have become my daughter's favorite shows. The sheer number of episodes that come in this amazing collection is staggering, considering how inexpensive it is. You're literally getting hours and hours of Curious George. Great for long car/plane trips and vacations. We've bought Clifford and Dora collections, but this Curious George collection is by far my favorite and my daughter's favorite. We picked it up while she was still 2 years old. She just turned 3 and still requests it. She never gets tired of them. My only word of caution is the ""cave"" episode deals with being afraid of the dark and that things can look scary in the dark. Although watching the episode didn't frighten my daughter, it did heighten her awareness about the dark and probably accelerated her discomfort with it. So depending on the age of your child and their personalities, it's the one episode I would be extra cautious about. Otherwise, I can honestly say this is the best collection of shows, and possibly one of the best educational shows out there, and I highly recommend it. I only wish there was a volume 2 out there now!",5,Indispensable!,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,1291,"['wife', 'are', 'careful', 'what', 'how', 'much', 'TV', 'let', 'daughter', 'watch', 'Curious', 'George', 'one', 'few', ""'re"", 'very', 'happy', 'let', 'watch', 'together', 'Clifford', 'have', 'become', 'daughter', 'favorite', 'shows', 'sheer', 'number', 'episodes', 'come', 'amazing', 'collection', 'staggering', 'considering', 'how', 'inexpensive', ""'re"", 'literally', 'getting', 'hours', 'hours', 'Curious', 'George', 'Great', 'long', 'car/plane', 'trips', 'vacations', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'Clifford', 'Dora', 'collections', 'Curious', 'George', 'collection', 'far', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'favorite', 'picked', 'up', 'was', 'still', '2', 'years', 'old', 'just', 'turned', '3', 'still', 'never', 'tired', 'only', 'word', 'caution', 'cave', 'episode', 'deals', 'being', 'afraid', 'dark', 'things', 'can', 'look', 'scary', 'dark', 'watching', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'frighten', 'daughter', 'did', 'heighten', 'awareness', 'dark', 'probably', 'accelerated', 'discomfort', 'So', 'depending', 'age', 'child', 'personalities', 'one', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'extra', 'cautious', 'Otherwise', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'best', 'collection', 'shows', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'educational', 'out', 'there', 'highly', 'recommend', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'volume', '2', 'there', 'now']",Curious George: Monkey Collection - Volume 1

Each disk is in the original case. The disks areCurious George: Zoo Night and Other Animal Stories!;Curious George Plays in the Snow and Other Awesome Activities!;Curious George: Takes a Job and More Monkey Business!;Curious George: Rocket Ride and Other Adventures!Each disk has eight episodes.From what I've seen, many of these have not been shown on PBS for at least the past 6 months. We watch Curious George a lot at my house and they seem to run the same few episodes over and over again. So, this boxed set is not only a bargain--it's a relief!

For a monkey that doesn't talk, George conveys a lot of teaching in each of his lessons.
