Hank Moody is the modern day Holden Caulfield, awash in substance abuse, self loathing and sex. he wanders aimlessly from hilarious encounter to hilarious encounter. The darker moments are broken up by his sad clown sidekick Charlie Runkle,  This season sees Hank and Charlie delve deeply into the depravity of aging rock star Atticus Fetch(an amalgam of just about every super rich aging rock star). Hank struggles to remain connected with his now adult daughter who to his horror is rapidly turning in to him and continues to attempt to integrate himself into the life of his true love Karen.

1652183,A184A7TYY9SKX,B00CYQXCDK,Jacktavish,"[5, 7]","It's sad to see this once great show sink so low, into re-runs & tired sub-plots. I can't believe there will actually be a 7th season!The first two seasons were classic! The only reason fans keep watching, is that the Hank Moody character has a lot of funny lines.Californication is completely out of touch with reality at this point. Hank collaborates with an egotistical rock star (hmmm, sounds familiar--Season 2), who is played by a wannabe Russell Brand, except less talented, and if possible, more annoying.The show should take place in the '90's when hard rock/metal stars ruled LA during Guns&Roses; heyday. Now in 2014 it seems ridiculous to have all these leather-clad, big-haired rockers talking about record albums, as they lie around in coke-fueled, sex orgies. Sure, that stuff still happens, but the music scene & look has changed in the last quarter-century. Then we have the ""Runkle pretends to be gay"" sub-plot, which is funny for 5 minutes, but they keep beating the dead horse.Part of the success of early seasons, was that Karen was married, so Hank yearned for her love, but still caroused and got in plenty of trouble. I actually miss Karen's husband, and her manipulative step-daughter. (However, Karen as a former bartender at CBGB's is completely unbelievable. Do the writers/producers live in an LA bubble?) Both actors are needed. Marcy is just not that interesting, and the writers seem determined to have the characters say c#ck or v#gina as many times per episode as possible, to where it's not shocking or funny or anything anymore. How many times can you bear to see Runkle run around naked? This season is very predictable. If Hank gets in a fight with some man, a few episodes later they will be collaborating on a movie/screenplay/book and doing drugs together. If Hank meets a woman who hates him or is not interested, a few episodes later they will be in the sack together. Zero character development.There are funny lines and, as usual, plenty of nudity in this season, but lower your expectations. This show should have ended after the 4th Season. Last person watching the show, please turn the lights out. I didn't even finish Season 6, and I'm bailing.",3,Someone pull the plug already!,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,2194,"['sad', 'see', 'once', 'great', 'show', 'sink', 'so', 'low', 're-runs', 'tired', 'sub-plots', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'will', 'actually', 'be', '7th', 'season', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'classic', 'only', 'reason', 'fans', 'keep', 'watching', 'Hank', 'Moody', 'character', 'lot', 'funny', 'lines.Californication', 'completely', 'touch', 'reality', 'point', 'Hank', 'egotistical', 'rock', 'star', 'hmmm', 'familiar', 'Season', '2', 'who', 'played', 'wannabe', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'less', 'talented', 'possible', 'more', 'annoying.The', 'show', 'should', 'take', 'place', ""'90"", 'when', 'hard', 'rock/metal', 'stars', 'ruled', 'LA', 'Guns', 'Roses', 'heyday', 'Now', '2014', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'leather-clad', 'big-haired', 'rockers', 'talking', 'record', 'albums', 'lie', 'around', 'coke-fueled', 'sex', 'orgies', 'Sure', 'stuff', 'still', 'music', 'scene', 'look', 'changed', 'last', 'quarter-century', 'Then', 'have', 'Runkle', 'be', 'gay', 'sub-plot', 'funny', '5', 'minutes', 'keep', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse.Part', 'success', 'early', 'seasons', 'was', 'Karen', 'was', 'married', 'Hank', 'yearned', 'love', 'still', 'caroused', 'got', 'plenty', 'trouble', 'actually', 'miss', 'Karen', 'husband', 'manipulative', 'step-daughter', 'However', 'Karen', 'former', 'bartender', 'CBGB', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'Do', 'writers/producers', 'live', 'LA', 'bubble', 'actors', 'are', 'needed', 'Marcy', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'writers', 'seem', 'determined', 'have', 'characters', 'say', 'c', 'ck', 'v', 'gina', 'many', 'times', 'per', 'episode', 'possible', 'where', 'not', 'shocking', 'funny', 'anything', 'anymore', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'bear', 'see', 'Runkle', 'run', 'around', 'naked', 'season', 'very', 'predictable', 'Hank', 'fight', 'man', 'few', 'episodes', 'later', 'will', 'be', 'collaborating', 'movie/screenplay/book', 'doing', 'drugs', 'together', 'Hank', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'interested', 'few', 'episodes', 'later', 'will', 'be', 'sack', 'together', 'Zero', 'character', 'are', 'funny', 'lines', 'usual', 'plenty', 'nudity', 'season', 'lower', 'expectations', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'ended', '4th', 'Season', 'Last', 'person', 'watching', 'show', 'please', 'turn', 'lights', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'Season', '6', ""'m"", 'bailing']",Californication: Season 6
1652184,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00CYQXCDK,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[19, 23]","The one thing that Season Six of Showtime's sex, drugs and writer's ennui sitcom CALIFORNICATION seemed to have going for it at its opening was the result of the almost-murder/suicide by one of Hank's many lovers (portrayed by Natalie Zea), and his resultant depression and alcohol-drenched daze he finds himself in after she dies.It made me stop and wonder if perhaps the show might go slightly back to the roots that it laid for itself when Hank was still a pretty unlikable guy. That's what made the show such a wonderful thing in its opening season is that Hank Moody was not without charm and humor and heart, but at his essence he was selfish, immature, self-pitying and frustratingly childish. But, after about one episode, that idea is gone to make way for COMEDY! After all, it's not like this show feels like exploring the dark side of anything anymore. We have madcap rehab silliness, a ""man pretending to be gay"" story arc that is recycled from some of the worst rom-coms of the 90's, Hank begrudgingly writing a rock opera with a drug-crazed rock god, and, of course, a pornucopia of women willing to do anything with the men on this show for comic value.In recent seasons though, all of those character flaws that define Duchovny's character have become virtuous and make him even more attractive to every other woman with the exception of Karen, the woman he actually does love. This season's primary paramour is that of Faith (LOST and TAKEN's Maggie Grace), a good girl gone bad that he meets in rehab for his alcoholism and drug addiction. Faith, a professional rock groupie and muse, is instantly annoyed with him, which of course means that she will end up falling for him in some way.Of course, there's the various other people in Hank's life that make the show a little more bearable, such as the eternally funny Evan Handler as Charlie, whose name and likeness suggest a certain Charlie Brown-like quality; he can't really seem to get a break. This personifies itself most especially in a kind of mildly offensive way in the character of Ophelia (Janice Wheeler), who is a friend of his ex-wife Marcy (Pamela Adlon, stepping up her game considerably after last season). Ophelia is a horrifyingly intense and violent feminist author that suggests that even this show can't escape the ""comic"" trappings of having a feminist character be a caricature of some form. She's so extreme that it suggests the real-life version of the feminist book store owners that Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein so hilariously send up in PORTLANDIA.Don't get me wrong; the show is still watchable and somewhat fun, but it's gone so far from it's original mission statement that the show really only exists to showcase the depths of stupidity and depravity that only L.A's rich and shameless are willing to stoop to.",3,"While entertaining, the show can't stay this way for much longer.",1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,2818,"['one', 'thing', 'Season', 'Six', 'Showtime', 'sex', 'drugs', 'writer', 'ennui', 'sitcom', 'CALIFORNICATION', 'seemed', 'have', 'going', 'opening', 'was', 'result', 'almost-murder/suicide', 'one', 'Hank', 'many', 'lovers', 'portrayed', 'Natalie', 'Zea', 'resultant', 'depression', 'alcohol-drenched', 'daze', 'dies.It', 'made', 'stop', 'wonder', 'perhaps', 'show', 'might', 'go', 'slightly', 'back', 'roots', 'laid', 'when', 'Hank', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'unlikable', 'guy', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'such', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'opening', 'season', 'Hank', 'Moody', 'was', 'not', 'charm', 'humor', 'heart', 'essence', 'was', 'selfish', 'immature', 'self-pitying', 'frustratingly', 'childish', 'one', 'episode', 'idea', 'gone', 'make', 'way', 'COMEDY', 'not', 'show', 'exploring', 'dark', 'side', 'anything', 'anymore', 'have', 'madcap', 'rehab', 'silliness', 'man', 'pretending', 'be', 'gay', 'story', 'arc', 'recycled', 'worst', 'rom-coms', '90', 'Hank', 'begrudgingly', 'writing', 'rock', 'opera', 'drug-crazed', 'rock', 'god', 'course', 'pornucopia', 'women', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'men', 'show', 'comic', 'value.In', 'recent', 'seasons', 'character', 'flaws', 'define', 'Duchovny', 'character', 'have', 'become', 'virtuous', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'attractive', 'other', 'woman', 'exception', 'Karen', 'woman', 'actually', 'love', 'season', 'primary', 'paramour', 'Faith', 'LOST', 'TAKEN', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'good', 'girl', 'gone', 'bad', 'rehab', 'alcoholism', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Faith', 'professional', 'rock', 'groupie', 'muse', 'instantly', 'annoyed', 'course', 'means', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'way.Of', 'course', 'various', 'other', 'people', 'Hank', 'life', 'make', 'show', 'little', 'more', 'bearable', 'such', 'eternally', 'funny', 'Evan', 'Handler', 'Charlie', 'name', 'likeness', 'suggest', 'certain', 'Charlie', 'Brown-like', 'quality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'get', 'break', 'most', 'especially', 'kind', 'mildly', 'offensive', 'way', 'character', 'Ophelia', 'Janice', 'Wheeler', 'who', 'friend', 'ex-wife', 'Marcy', 'Pamela', 'Adlon', 'stepping', 'up', 'game', 'considerably', 'last', 'season', 'Ophelia', 'horrifyingly', 'intense', 'violent', 'feminist', 'author', 'even', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'comic', 'trappings', 'having', 'feminist', 'character', 'be', 'caricature', 'form', 'so', 'extreme', 'real-life', 'version', 'feminist', 'book', 'store', 'owners', 'Fred', 'Armisen', 'Carrie', 'Brownstein', 'so', 'hilariously', 'send', 'up', 'PORTLANDIA.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'show', 'still', 'watchable', 'somewhat', 'fun', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'original', 'mission', 'statement', 'show', 'really', 'only', 'showcase', 'depths', 'stupidity', 'depravity', 'only', 'L.A', 'rich', 'shameless', 'are', 'willing', 'stoop']",Californication: Season 6
1652185,A111TATNFNSU3X,B00CYQXCDK,Knight Poet,"[1, 2]","What I find particularly disturbing about this episodic immersion into the dark depths of depravity is the casual if not concealed manner in which lines of unambiguously blasphemous content is woven into the foul fabric of the dialogue in such a way so as to leave one contemplating whether or not to smile at some non-blasphemous contrivance of comedic intentions before even realizing that they just referred to God (again) as though God was created in hedonistic Hank's sex-addicted image (and sexplicitly sexualizing the Universal Creator in increasingly perverse ways is not something this God-knowing faith-child of the Supreme Being finds to be even vaguely funny). In the grand scheme of things that is etched upon the master blueprint in the multi-layered mind of God, it doesn't really matter what I think about this pessimistically pathetic pool of God-hating bottom-feeders who excrete the blasphemy-stained fruit that oozes forth from the lower extremities of their script-producing black holes in such a despicably disgusting way that even now fills the crumbling cave of Californication's soon-to-be-cancelled show with the decaying echo of what it sounds like to hear a legion of literary losers commit mass spiritual suicide one unspeakably unholy syllable at a time. I mean it's pretty easy to figure out that I am not exactly a fan of spiritually-dead writer-whores who freely choose to spread wide the wobbly legs of their vacuous minds to spasmodically spew forth countless pages of grotesquely descriptive depravities that might gag Lucifer himself.

In this season, we start with Hank waking up in a hospital after almost dying from the overdose Carrie administered him. The stint in rehab is interesting and provides us with many funny moments, but even more importantly, Hank runs into Faith, a mysterious young woman who seems to hate him on sight.This season involves several different topics, rock stars, groupies, Becca's growing up and her hopes and interest in experimenting life, and a wacko that hates men among many others. We definitely are kept engaged throughout the season. There are a couple of cases in which the writers seem to be trying too hard to come up with new material that shocks the audience (i.e. Hank drinking his own urine), but overall they do a great job.The aspect that left me a little disappointed is that no matter how much the story moves up down and sideways during the season, we always seem to end up in the same place, and that is getting a little frustrating. If you are fine with continuing with the status quo, then you will love this season, but if you are like me, you may be losing your patience a tiny bit and want the writers to get going already. I don't care which way they want the story to go, just make it go somewhere.As you can see from my rating though, this series has so many aspects that are positive and better than everything else out there that I can't judge it too harsh when it's time to give it the final score.
