997392,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B000FZETU2,Addicted2Amazon!,"[2, 2]","A couple years ago, when I first began the whole at-home exercise thing, I picked this title up from Walmart. Fast forward a few years later, and I still am a loyal Firm customer!This 40-minute workout is probably not ultra- challenging to anyone who has become used to high-energy, high-impact cardio.  However, if you like to shimmy your shoulders and pop your hips a little bit, I think you'll find it a fun workout regardless of its level of difficulty. It consists of a 5-minute warm-up, 30 minutes of steady-state dance cardio and a 5-minute cool-down.As I already stated, this was one of my first ever workout DVDs. In fact, it was probably the first dance DVD that I owned in which heart rate and fat-burning were the primary aim, instead of dance instruction first. So when I gave this a go initially, it kicked my rear and introduced me to REAL fitness!I recently pulled this one out again for a retro workout, and now it's kind of hard to imagine there ever having been a point when I could barely finish this! My strength and stamina have come a long way I guess. But a before-and-after experience was great for seeing how a beginner would do with this workout as opposed to how an intermediate/advanced would feel towards it.As stated before, CDSD is 40 minutes long in total. The aerobics portion is divided (though not chaptered, as it will only play in one complete 40 min. session) into 10 minutes of ""club""dancing (you can decide if you would do these moves in a club!) , 10 minutes of Latin (you know, cha-chas, mambos, shoulder shakes) and 10 minutes of disco-style dancing (think Saturday Night Fever...that either scares you or makes you smile!). The choreography is done in an add-on style, so there is a lot of taking it from the top and then adding one more move until you have a flowing series.Personally, I like dance cardio, so I own a few of them. That being said, this was probably one of the better ones.  The moves are reasonably modern (excluding disco!) and not as unbelievably corny and cheesy as many of Denise Austin's dance videos, for example (no offense to Ms. Austin; I enjoy most of her workouts). And neither are they soo cutting edge and Janet Jackson-worthy that you literally will have to stop the DVD and rewind it several times, thus damaging its value as a workout (Lisa Nunziella!!). If someone was watching me, I wouldn't be all that embarrassed (at least not during the Club or Latin parts...)!The music is just okay, not the best. In fact, in parts, the music doesn't seem to fit the style of dance being done. For example, during the Latin segment (which is nonetheless my favorite!), the music suddenly morphs from a somewhat Latin-ish style to a techno thumping beat. Huh? Oh well, I have fun anyway.Another small caveat: Some of the moves aren't the greatest on carpet, such as the butterfly (though I like this move b/c it reminds me of house parties in junior high!). But they're not really that numerous to be a huge issue. I'm sure you can make it work!Like most dance-inspired workouts, you get out of it what you put into it. If you REALLY shake your shoulders when you're supposed to, and REALLY get into that mambo, you will get your heart rate up. Now that being said, intermediate/advanced exercisers will probably come out having shed some slight sweat that will quickly evaporate.  Beginners will get the most out of this.  This workout is pretty low-impact, with some light jumping in the club segment as well as the very end of the disco segment.If you would like to see a clip of this (I recommend that you do), you can check it out at The Firm's official site under ""Store.""",3,GREAT for Beginners...Good for Booty Shakers...!,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,3647,"['couple', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'began', 'whole', 'at-home', 'exercise', 'thing', 'picked', 'title', 'up', 'Walmart', 'Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'am', 'loyal', 'Firm', 'customer', '40-minute', 'workout', 'probably', 'not', 'ultra-', 'challenging', 'anyone', 'who', 'become', 'used', 'high-energy', 'high-impact', 'cardio', 'However', 'like', 'shimmy', 'shoulders', 'pop', 'hips', 'little', 'bit', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'fun', 'regardless', 'level', 'difficulty', '5-minute', 'warm-up', '30', 'minutes', 'steady-state', 'dance', 'cardio', '5-minute', 'cool-down.As', 'already', 'stated', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'ever', 'DVDs', 'fact', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'dance', 'DVD', 'owned', 'heart', 'rate', 'fat-burning', 'were', 'primary', 'aim', 'instead', 'dance', 'instruction', 'first', 'So', 'when', 'gave', 'go', 'initially', 'kicked', 'rear', 'introduced', 'REAL', 'fitness', 'recently', 'pulled', 'one', 'out', 'again', 'retro', 'workout', 'now', 'kind', 'hard', 'imagine', 'there', 'ever', 'having', 'been', 'point', 'when', 'could', 'barely', 'finish', 'strength', 'stamina', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'guess', 'before-and-after', 'experience', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'how', 'beginner', 'would', 'do', 'workout', 'opposed', 'how', 'intermediate/advanced', 'would', 'feel', 'towards', 'it.As', 'stated', 'CDSD', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'total', 'aerobics', 'portion', 'divided', 'not', 'chaptered', 'will', 'only', 'play', 'one', 'complete', '40', 'min', 'session', '10', 'minutes', 'club', 'dancing', 'can', 'decide', 'would', 'do', 'moves', 'club', '10', 'minutes', 'Latin', 'know', 'cha-chas', 'mambos', 'shoulder', 'shakes', '10', 'minutes', 'disco-style', 'dancing', 'think', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'scares', 'smile', 'choreography', 'done', 'add-on', 'style', 'lot', 'taking', 'top', 'then', 'adding', 'one', 'more', 'move', 'have', 'flowing', 'series.Personally', 'like', 'dance', 'cardio', 'own', 'few', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'moves', 'are', 'reasonably', 'modern', 'excluding', 'disco', 'not', 'unbelievably', 'corny', 'cheesy', 'many', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'dance', 'videos', 'example', 'offense', 'Ms.', 'Austin', 'enjoy', 'most', 'workouts', 'are', 'soo', 'cutting', 'edge', 'Janet', 'Jackson-worthy', 'literally', 'will', 'have', 'stop', 'DVD', 'rewind', 'several', 'times', 'thus', 'damaging', 'value', 'workout', 'Lisa', 'Nunziella', 'someone', 'was', 'watching', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'embarrassed', 'least', 'not', 'Club', 'Latin', 'parts', 'music', 'just', 'okay', 'not', 'best', 'fact', 'parts', 'music', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'style', 'dance', 'being', 'done', 'example', 'Latin', 'segment', 'nonetheless', 'favorite', 'music', 'suddenly', 'somewhat', 'Latin-ish', 'style', 'techno', 'thumping', 'beat', 'Huh', 'Oh', 'well', 'have', 'fun', 'anyway.Another', 'small', 'caveat', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'carpet', 'such', 'butterfly', 'like', 'move', 'house', 'parties', 'junior', 'high', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'numerous', 'be', 'huge', 'issue', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'make', 'work', 'most', 'dance-inspired', 'workouts', 'get', 'put', 'REALLY', 'shake', 'shoulders', 'when', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'REALLY', 'get', 'mambo', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'Now', 'being', 'said', 'intermediate/advanced', 'exercisers', 'will', 'probably', 'come', 'out', 'having', 'shed', 'slight', 'sweat', 'will', 'quickly', 'evaporate', 'Beginners', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'workout', 'pretty', 'low-impact', 'light', 'jumping', 'club', 'segment', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'end', 'disco', 'segment.If', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'clip', 'recommend', 'do', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'Firm', 'official', 'site', 'Store']",N/A

I workout 4 to 5 times per week with Firm workouts, and usually break a sweat and feel as though I've gotten a good workout when all is said and done. This isn't the case with Cardio Dance. I barely break a sweat. It's very low-impact, and doesn't get my heart rate up to its desire level for fat burning. I think I'd get a better workout dancing around the house.What makes Cardio Dance unbearable is Allie's lack of cueing (which is nearly non-existent in this workout), and the lack of rhythm within the workout moves. The dance moves are supposed to be fun, but the manner in which the moves are combined makes them feel awkward, and forced. They don't flow and are therefore difficult to commit to memory. In addition to this, the dance moves incorporate a large amount of swiveling and dragging one's feet on the ground. This might be fine for someone working out on a smooth, hardwood floor, but for those who happen to work out on carpet or on a matt (as is the case with most home exercisers), this is hard on the knees. I'd rather jump than slide my feet around, but this workout has no jumping, just sliding, snapping and bouncing. Boring.I wouldn't recommend this workout to anyone.

There is no toning involved and the workout from start to finish is just under 40 minutes, so it's good for light workout days.",3,Fun dance workout,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,517,"['might', 'not', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', ""'d"", 'like', 'however', 'creativity', 'extra', 'effort', 'can', 'increase', 'intensity', 'moves', 'enjoyed', 'instructor', 'was', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'cues', 'are', 'excellent', 'Many', 'moves', 'are', 'cheesy', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'trying', 'club', 'pretty', 'fun', 'do', 'blinds', 'closed', 'comforts', 'home', 'toning', 'involved', 'workout', 'start', 'finish', 'just', '40', 'minutes', 'good', 'light', 'workout', 'days']",N/A

It's well-structured, the warm-up and cool-down segments are creative and excellent, and the dance choreography portions are thrillingly doable and allow for lots of personal expression. Allie DelRio is one of my favorite Firm instructors and I do her workouts with the step and weights and this floor routine is a wonderful break from the other routine while loosening your muscles and giving a great aerobic workout.

Initially I thought I wasn't getting much of a good workout, but after doing it a couple of times and getting more familiar with the moves, I could put more effort into it and get a really good, FUN workout!

Allie is great, good cues, sweet, she tries SOO much, but she dances like she's rushing to get it over with or being rushed, so there's no style or enjoyment. The moves & her dancing is what is lacking. The music is bad mixed that tries to steal some parts from popular music w/o getting sued, but sounds too boring.The warm up tries to use head rolls, shoulder rolls & bad hip rolls as a warmup that is too fast. You don't get any stretch or benefit from it.All the moves are VERY cheesy, there's only a few cha-chas, grapevines, ""hitchhiker"" & etc. that are somewhat decent, but the rest are, sorry to say LAUGH OUT LOUD bad. Even the latin cha-chas had NO hip use from any of them. They all look like cheerleader tryout rejects. Some of the moves are exactly like Starday Night John Travolata pointing, shifting an imaginary towel against your butt, box step, the jerk, locomotion, etc. If anyone did this on a dance floor everyone would be on the floor crying in laughter. This is the first dance workout of over like 50 I've seen that I was dying & couldn't even watch.The last 5 min cool down has better slower toning, stretching & finally a little grace.The only good I can say is the production quality, the music CAN be worse, but not by much, Allie does try her best & has good cues.
