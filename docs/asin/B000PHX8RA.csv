1071434,A33H8DC3ZG58T0,B000PHX8RA,"Amazon Customer ""gorgon-13""","[0, 0]","A DVD with a real split personality, in part the CGI is really good, yet in some scenes they appear almost to have done away with sets to cut the budget. Part one in particular is almost reminiscent of a stage play, with three characters in one or two Spartan rooms pontificating endlessly on religion. Commander Lockley has come up against what she for reasons implausible and somewhat out of context for the B5 world, has decided is a case of demonic possession. She sends for one of the last priests in circulation, apparently they're dying out as humanity loses faith. Odd as Commander Sinclair could fill a corridor with assorted religious dignitaries and Sheriden had Brother Theo and his order, but then again, I suppose that's Valen and the President being more on the ball than the replacement. The whole thing is long winded and accompanied by really irritating camera work and a poor sound track. Perhaps it's only for B5 completists, but even they will be wondering what's going on as the quite overt religious element is so at odds with B5 as we know it that it really jars. Perhaps JMS has had a crisis of faith that triggered it.Part two is more familiar, President Sheriden is on his way to a conference when the Technomage Galen crops up doing his Cassandra imitation with more portents of doom and destruction. Apparently Emperor Cartagias son is due become emperor to revamp the Centauri republic and will destroy earth to remove an obstacle to his goal. The simple solution to this is to pre-emptively assassinate the youth before he grows into this monster. Sheriden agonises about killing off the young man before coming up with an alternative, less homicidal solution.While I'm glad that there's more material in the B5 verse, I can't say that it's that impressive, as a DVD the two stories don't gel in any way and only the second one shows any potential to add to the story arc. Neither would have made particularly good episodes and I'm sure that if JMS puts his mind to it he can write a single cohesive film length script better than this, even considering the clearly crippling budgetary constraints that have reduced cast and set to the barest minimum.As has been mentioned in other reviews, the obituaries of Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs are poignant and easily the most moving parts of the disk.",3,Somewhat underwelming.,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,2333,"['DVD', 'real', 'split', 'personality', 'part', 'CGI', 'really', 'good', 'yet', 'scenes', 'appear', 'almost', 'have', 'done', 'away', 'sets', 'cut', 'budget', 'Part', 'one', 'particular', 'almost', 'reminiscent', 'stage', 'play', 'three', 'characters', 'one', 'two', 'Spartan', 'rooms', 'pontificating', 'endlessly', 'religion', 'Commander', 'Lockley', 'come', 'up', 'what', 'reasons', 'implausible', 'context', 'B5', 'world', 'decided', 'case', 'demonic', 'possession', 'one', 'last', 'priests', 'circulation', 'apparently', ""'re"", 'dying', 'out', 'humanity', 'faith', 'Commander', 'Sinclair', 'could', 'fill', 'corridor', 'assorted', 'religious', 'dignitaries', 'Sheriden', 'had', 'Brother', 'Theo', 'order', 'then', 'again', 'suppose', 'Valen', 'President', 'being', 'more', 'ball', 'replacement', 'whole', 'thing', 'long', 'winded', 'accompanied', 'really', 'irritating', 'camera', 'work', 'poor', 'sound', 'track', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'B5', 'completists', 'even', 'will', 'be', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'quite', 'overt', 'religious', 'element', 'so', 'odds', 'B5', 'know', 'really', 'Perhaps', 'JMS', 'had', 'crisis', 'faith', 'triggered', 'it.Part', 'two', 'more', 'familiar', 'President', 'Sheriden', 'way', 'conference', 'when', 'Technomage', 'Galen', 'up', 'doing', 'Cassandra', 'imitation', 'more', 'portents', 'doom', 'destruction', 'Apparently', 'Emperor', 'Cartagias', 'son', 'due', 'become', 'emperor', 'revamp', 'Centauri', 'republic', 'will', 'destroy', 'earth', 'remove', 'obstacle', 'goal', 'simple', 'solution', 'pre-emptively', 'assassinate', 'youth', 'monster', 'Sheriden', 'agonises', 'killing', 'off', 'young', 'man', 'coming', 'up', 'alternative', 'less', 'homicidal', 'solution.While', ""'m"", 'glad', 'more', 'material', 'B5', 'verse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'impressive', 'DVD', 'two', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'gel', 'way', 'only', 'second', 'one', 'potential', 'add', 'story', 'arc', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'particularly', 'good', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'JMS', 'mind', 'can', 'write', 'single', 'cohesive', 'film', 'length', 'script', 'better', 'even', 'considering', 'clearly', 'crippling', 'budgetary', 'constraints', 'have', 'reduced', 'cast', 'set', 'barest', 'minimum.As', 'been', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'obituaries', 'Andreas', 'Katsulas', 'Richard', 'Biggs', 'are', 'poignant', 'easily', 'most', 'moving', 'parts', 'disk']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

(To Dream in the City of Sorrows, is my favorite). I watched this series when it first came on the air and followed all the way till now, but after Legend of the Rangers I was sure I would never get a new B5 offering. For a series with a scope, character, and depth of story that B5 offered this was a sad day. Then I heard about Lost Tales and I jumped for joy.I got my copy of the DVD as fast as it became available and I was not disappointed. The first story I found intriguing in concept and redone special effects were impressive. However, to me the Lost Tales didn't come alive till we reached Sheridan and Galen. The interaction between these two was as impressive as ever. Galen's mysterious nature and double talk were as well written and acted as ever. Lost Tales has left me breathless and craving more DVD's. Hopefully we'll finally get to see the Telepath War and maybe hopefully a continuation of Ivanova's story line.If you are a first time B5 watcher this is not the place to start, but if you have seen everything else this is a great chance to rejoin the B5 universe.",5,B5 - Lost Tales,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,1196,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'Babylon', '5', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'DVD', 'watched', 'episode', 'even', 'have', 'most', 'books', 'Dream', 'City', 'Sorrows', 'favorite', 'watched', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'air', 'followed', 'way', 'till', 'now', 'Legend', 'Rangers', 'was', 'sure', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'new', 'B5', 'offering', 'series', 'scope', 'character', 'depth', 'story', 'B5', 'offered', 'was', 'sad', 'day', 'Then', 'heard', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'jumped', 'joy.I', 'got', 'copy', 'DVD', 'fast', 'became', 'available', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'first', 'story', 'found', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'redone', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'impressive', 'However', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'alive', 'till', 'reached', 'Sheridan', 'Galen', 'interaction', 'two', 'was', 'as', 'impressive', 'ever', 'Galen', 'mysterious', 'nature', 'double', 'talk', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'ever', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'left', 'breathless', 'craving', 'more', 'DVD', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Telepath', 'War', 'maybe', 'hopefully', 'continuation', 'Ivanova', 'story', 'line.If', 'are', 'first', 'time', 'B5', 'watcher', 'not', 'place', 'start', 'have', 'seen', 'everything', 'else', 'great', 'chance', 'rejoin', 'B5', 'universe']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

If you are new to the series, please check the existing universe of B5 DVDs here at Amazon. Some of the spotlight reviews provide a list of the order in which to start watching.This is the first in a proposed series of anthology format direct-to-DVD releases. The DVD contains two interwoven stories featuring three B5 universe regulars (Sheridan, Lockley and techno-mage Galen (of Crusade)) and some new characters, including a Centauri Prince.This had a (working) title of ""Voices in the Dark"", but I don't see it mentioned on the DVD box cover.Originally JMS was planning three stories but the two stories ended up getting bigger, so the third story (involving Girabaldi) was postponed for a future release.Needless to say the decision on how many additional Babylon 5 DVDs to make and how frequently to make them will be partly affected by the sales of this one. So you know what to do, buy early and buy often ;-)Update 6/1: The official babylon5 website has posted a trailer (yes a trailer!) and two director's blogs under ""The Lost Tales movie"" segment... The trailer starts quietly but explodes halfway :)The DVD=======Ergonomics: The DVD is easy to slip in and out of the case. It comes out real easy, no need to flex or put pressure on the DVD like some dvd cases haveWhen you put the dvd in the dvd player and do nothing, playback starts with a two-minute promo for the direct to DVD animated release ""Superman Doomsday"".There is one audio track in english and subtitles in english. No other options.Voices in the Dark==================You can watch the two stories together or you can watch them separately. The separate titles are ""Over Here"" for the B5 story and ""Over There"" for the Sheridan story.I don't want to spoil the story or the plot or anything like that but the things I liked:* nicely done in-movie tributes to G'Kar and Dr Franklin (Beyond the Rim)* It was so nice to have brand new B5 universe stories!* A lot of subtle things in the movie were a treat for B5 fans. This shows that special attention was paid to make this true to the B5 spirit, and not yet another shoot'em up in space.  Also I appreciated that it did not have the traditional tv/movie mentality of saving-the-world in the last 30 seconds of the show.* Nice views of B5, and some nice ship views (but never enough!)* The first story (Lockley/B5) was a bit over the top at times, and Lockley talked a bit too much at times. Not that I am complaining, I'm just pointing it out :)* The closing lines at the end of the movie could have an additional meaning: you could read into them that they are also talking about future of dvd releases - perhaps :)Bonus Features==============1) Beyond the Rim Memorials for Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar) and Richard Biggs (Stephen), duration: 13 minutes2) Fireside Chats: JMS answers fan questions on camera (almost 19 minutes)3) JMS Diaries, production diaries (with some funny moments (eg sock puppets instead of actors)), 21 minutes long4) Interviews with JMS and the three stars of the dvd (Sheridan, Lockley and Galen), duration: 17 1/2 minutes.*) Total of bonus features: Around 80 minutes longWhy buy it?===========If you are a hardcore B5 fan (and you know who you are), this supports B5 in a way that encourages the masters of the universe to fund JMS for more and more B5 universe projects!When looking at the price please keep in mind that this is a direct to DVD release, with no TV/cable revenue and no theatrical release revenue.

It is certainly filled with all of the obvious revelations, quite elegantly giving remembrance to those that have gone ""Beyond the Rim.""It exposes an interesting edge of Lockley's character that *is* surprising, as she demonstrates a spiritual understanding that we'd associate more with Jeffrey Sinclair.I *think* that this subplot also points towards the way the Rangers would eventually be involved with rebuilding things (as seen in The Deconstruction of Falling Stars at the end of Season 4), as there is an elliptical reference to the notion that the Church still feels they have worthwhile things ""up their sleeves.""  Unfortunately, if I'm right, well, that was perhaps a bit too obvious.The second story, filled with veiled references to what we already know about what is to happen in the Centauri Empire, seems to me to fall down in this regard.  It *appears* to reveal things, but nothing that is really overly surprising.  Sheridan is presented, by Galen, a moral dilemma (and Galen is shown off as being really rather nasty), but to me, it's NOT one that is really challenging, as he had rather more difficult ones to deal with during the course of the main series. And that is one half of what disappoints.The other half is that, as a standalone pair of stories, this story is missing the ""arc"" rewards that the series offered.  It has plenty of brief connections into the details of both past and future, but can't make promises of what is yet to come, which was one of the great joys of the 5 year arc.  During the series, they had many revelations; they had to pay dearly for them.Now, even a ""pretty bad"" set of Straczynski stories (and this isn't actually bad) are generally better than most of the drek out there.

We would have seen the plot unfold, not be told about it. That would have been interesting. Listening to the story being told in what could very easily have been a radio play was not taking best advantage of the medium.I can only assume that the problem here was budgetary constraints. The casting is so sparse, with each episode having only a small handful of characters (each episode basically has one primary character from the old cast, a bit part for another old cast-member, one or two ""guest stars"", and that's about it) and a similarly small number of sets. The sparse production I suspect just really limited what they could do - limited things too much, I think, and so we end up with episodes that have a ton of exposition and not enough action or interaction.As a fan, I still enjoyed them as a diversion. They seem truer to the B5 mythos than Legend of the Rangers was, but the first story (featuring Scoggins) is a little heavy-handed, while the second one (featuring Boxleitner) is better. But both are just shadows of the past, sadly. Their relative averageness just serves to remind me how truly great a series Babylon 5 was.

I was expecting disappointment based on the reviews here, and I think that's because most of them were too focused on what was missing.This DVD is getting low marks from many of the 380 reviewers here because it is not the same as the Babylon 5 TV series. Certainly this was done on the cheap. The WB people have made tens, maybe hundreds of millions on the original series, but still they didn't want to spring for a full budget made-for-DVD release. Those were the constraints. Therefore, JMS (don't ask me to spell Babylon 5's creator's last name) wrote a script that could conform to the budget -- very few sets, very few actors, lots and lots of computer generated backgrounds.However, this ""movie"" tells two great stories set in the Babylon 5 universe that do not require many sets or a large cast. For success, it only needed good dialogue and good acting to deliver that dialogue. Think back to one of the better Star Trek Original Series episodes, ""Court Marshall."" This was largely a courtroom drama. It consisted mostly of people talking. The cast of Babylon 5 The Lost Tales is perhaps equivalent to Court Marshall, with fewer extras. And there's a lot of talking. If that sort of thing bores you, you can skip this DVD. But if you can't enjoy two very good little dramas just because there aren't any space battles or people blasting phasers at one another, or attacking each other with swords and knives, then you really are missing out.The first ""tale"" is a little bit like an Outer Limits episode, about the B5 Captain calling in a priest  because she fears one of her crew may be possessed and may require an exorcism. The second tale is about President Sheridan's return for an anniversary celebration on B5. A technomage shows Sheridan the future in a dream, a future of destruction and death for millions. Sheridan can stop this future, but only by committing murder.Both of these stories are well-told and well-acted. The demon-possessed man and the priest in the first tale are both superb. In the second tale, Boxleitner's President Sheridan displays the kind of authority that comes with power, the annoyance with its downside, and the plot hinges on the moral dilemma, 'Would you have killed Hitler as a child, if you had the chance?' The technomage is well-played, too. The first tale also involves a moral dilemma: Exactly how do you deal with evil and how do you extract the truth from a confirmed liar?What this DVD movie IS, is two excellent stories, told in a way that does not require an extensive cast or lots of interior sets. We can hope for future movies that will include all of that. But these stories almost *could* have been told effectively with sock puppets, as JMS jokingly hints. Our imaginations can make up for what is lacking, if the actors do their jobs. With the computer graphics on display here, we need not even imagine anything. It's all been done for us.Is this DVD worth purchasing? Well, it is certainly worth seeing. I watched it twice before returning it to Netflix. I am notoriously cheap. Compared to the value you can get by buying one of the B5 season sets when they go on sale for $20-25, this is not a good value. Still, I would pay $5-6 to own this. Perhaps I will buy it through a DVD club.",4,"Critics are reviewing it for what it is NOT, missing what it IS",1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,3338,"['When', 'finally', 'saw', 'DVD', 'Netflix', 'rental', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'was', 'expecting', 'disappointment', 'based', 'reviews', 'here', 'think', 'most', 'were', 'too', 'focused', 'what', 'was', 'missing.This', 'DVD', 'getting', 'low', 'marks', 'many', '380', 'reviewers', 'here', 'not', 'same', 'Babylon', '5', 'TV', 'series', 'Certainly', 'was', 'done', 'cheap', 'WB', 'people', 'have', 'made', 'tens', 'maybe', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'original', 'series', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'spring', 'full', 'budget', 'made-for-DVD', 'release', 'were', 'constraints', 'Therefore', 'JMS', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'spell', 'Babylon', '5', 'creator', 'last', 'name', 'wrote', 'script', 'could', 'conform', 'budget', 'very', 'few', 'sets', 'very', 'few', 'actors', 'lots', 'lots', 'computer', 'generated', 'backgrounds.However', 'movie', 'tells', 'two', 'great', 'stories', 'set', 'Babylon', '5', 'universe', 'do', 'not', 'require', 'many', 'sets', 'large', 'cast', 'success', 'only', 'needed', 'good', 'dialogue', 'good', 'acting', 'deliver', 'dialogue', 'Think', 'back', 'one', 'better', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Original', 'Series', 'Court', 'Marshall', 'was', 'largely', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'consisted', 'mostly', 'people', 'talking', 'cast', 'Babylon', '5', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'perhaps', 'equivalent', 'Court', 'Marshall', 'fewer', 'extras', 'lot', 'talking', 'sort', 'thing', 'bores', 'can', 'skip', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'little', 'dramas', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'space', 'people', 'blasting', 'phasers', 'one', 'attacking', 'other', 'swords', 'knives', 'then', 'really', 'are', 'missing', 'first', 'tale', 'little', 'bit', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'episode', 'B5', 'Captain', 'calling', 'priest', 'one', 'crew', 'may', 'be', 'possessed', 'may', 'require', 'exorcism', 'second', 'tale', 'President', 'Sheridan', 'return', 'anniversary', 'celebration', 'B5', 'technomage', 'Sheridan', 'future', 'dream', 'future', 'destruction', 'death', 'millions', 'Sheridan', 'can', 'stop', 'future', 'only', 'committing', 'murder.Both', 'stories', 'are', 'well-told', 'well-acted', 'demon-possessed', 'man', 'priest', 'first', 'tale', 'are', 'superb', 'second', 'tale', 'Boxleitner', 'President', 'Sheridan', 'kind', 'authority', 'power', 'annoyance', 'downside', 'plot', 'hinges', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'have', 'killed', 'Hitler', 'child', 'had', 'chance', 'technomage', 'well-played', 'too', 'first', 'tale', 'also', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'Exactly', 'how', 'do', 'deal', 'evil', 'how', 'do', 'extract', 'truth', 'confirmed', 'liar', 'What', 'DVD', 'movie', 'IS', 'two', 'excellent', 'stories', 'told', 'way', 'not', 'require', 'extensive', 'cast', 'lots', 'interior', 'sets', 'can', 'hope', 'future', 'movies', 'will', 'include', 'stories', 'almost', '*could*', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'effectively', 'sock', 'puppets', 'JMS', 'jokingly', 'imaginations', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'lacking', 'actors', 'do', 'jobs', 'computer', 'graphics', 'display', 'here', 'need', 'not', 'even', 'imagine', 'anything', 'been', 'done', 'us.Is', 'DVD', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'Well', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'watched', 'twice', 'returning', 'Netflix', 'am', 'notoriously', 'cheap', 'Compared', 'value', 'can', 'get', 'buying', 'one', 'B5', 'season', 'sets', 'when', 'go', 'sale', '20-25', 'not', 'good', 'value', 'Still', 'would', 'pay', '5-6', 'own', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'buy', 'DVD', 'club']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

To any die-hard B5 fan, this just wets the appetite for more.Bruce Boxleitner and Tracy Scoggins each game impressive performances, as well as Peter Woodward. Keegan MacIntosh also is a fresh face (and talented young actor)--new character with ties that sends chills up the spine of any B5 fan.The stories, typical of J Michael Straczynski, are better the more they are viewed. What to the initial viewing may seem one thing, upon closer viewing (and listening) reveals many layers of thought and imagination. It is very obvious JMS has made a lifetime study of humanity and the psychology thereof...his writing has many levels of introspection--philosophical, spiritual (where appropriate), psychological, and very human--get to your gut feelings--but you have to be willing to go beyond the first viewing to get there! Unfortunately, there is (also) the feeling that something is ""missing."" JMS usually gave three plots per episode for the series. The absence of a third story intertwined with the other two is a big void at times...you keep hoping for more. The intended plot story with Jerry Doyle would have been best to have left in the mix, instead of saving it for another DVD...One can only hope that this will be the first of many ""stories"" in the B5 universe that fans have been craving since the series left the airwaves. Warner Bros has its fingers on a real treasure, if they would only allow it to be in syndication again...All in all, this is a must-have for B5 fans who have waited so long for more stories to tease our psyche.Thank you JMS, and thank you WB for giving the fans a taste of what we have asked for these years since B5 went off the air!

The DVD is the first of a planned 6 that will look at select characters from the series that will fill in bits of their story as well as that of the Babylon 5 universe as a whole.The new information that is given is often subtle while some of it is very upfront. One such instance is when a Centauri Prince who is 3rd in line to the throne brings up the subject of Vir. In a somewhat offhand manner, the character mentions that rumor has it that Vir killed his father. Fans of the series will be able to conclude that the character is the child of the Manical Catragia, and that when a dire warning is given about his role in the future, you have a nice framework for possible futuire events.Divided into two stories, the first is a interesting spiritual based story, while the second is more of the thriller variety.The FX have improved and the station has never looked better. My biggest concern with the film, was that there was a severe lack of any real action.

Will faith expand or diminish?  It was kind of like a cross between H.P Lovecraft and The Exorcist.  This will be the biggest bone of contention among the fans, those who don't necessarily believe in God will go Whaaa?  Demons that's just stupid.The second Tale focuses on Sheridan and the choice he must make regarding a possible future and the life of one young man.  Galen also makes an appearance here (about time)better then the first the ultimate resolution is going to create some problems with continuity.All in all if they were considered as individual episodes better then seasons one and five not as good as 3-4.In terms of the other movies not as good as In the Beginning or The Gathering but better then Thridspace or River of Souls.  I don't love these ""Lost Tales"" but I can't say I hate them either.My main complaints would be the lack of time spent in the B5 universe (but this just shows how desperate I am for a fix) and the fact that the low budget showed almost no time was spent traveling from place to place all of the action was only confined to a single room.  Bottom Line here the low budjet shows.Hopefully the sales will be good enough from these DVD's to kick start the series again so the next installment of the lost tales will not seem so abrupt.",4,I rounded up wish I could give 3.5,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,1683,"['Got', 'copy', 'courtesy', 'good', 'people', 'UPS', 'today', 'well', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'better', 'then', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be.The', 'main', 'problem', 'installments', 'were', 'too', 'short', 'also', 'theses', 'are', 'not', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'so', 'much', 'moral', 'tales', 'first', 'moral', 'tale', 'actually', 'interesting', 'question', 'what', 'exactly', 'belife', 'god', 'when', 'are', 'confronted', 'presence', 'aliens', 'Will', 'faith', 'expand', 'diminish', 'was', 'kind', 'cross', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'Exorcist', 'will', 'be', 'biggest', 'bone', 'contention', 'fans', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'believe', 'God', 'will', 'go', 'Whaaa', 'Demons', 'just', 'stupid.The', 'second', 'Tale', 'focuses', 'Sheridan', 'choice', 'must', 'make', 'regarding', 'possible', 'future', 'life', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'Galen', 'also', 'appearance', 'here', 'time', 'better', 'then', 'first', 'ultimate', 'resolution', 'going', 'create', 'problems', 'continuity.All', 'were', 'considered', 'individual', 'episodes', 'better', 'then', 'seasons', 'one', 'five', 'not', 'as', 'good', '3-4.In', 'terms', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Beginning', 'Gathering', 'better', 'then', 'Thridspace', 'River', 'Souls', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'hate', 'either.My', 'main', 'complaints', 'would', 'be', 'lack', 'time', 'spent', 'B5', 'universe', 'just', 'how', 'desperate', 'am', 'fix', 'fact', 'low', 'budget', 'showed', 'almost', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'traveling', 'place', 'place', 'action', 'was', 'only', 'confined', 'single', 'room', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'here', 'low', 'budjet', 'shows.Hopefully', 'sales', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'DVD', 'kick', 'start', 'series', 'again', 'next', 'installment', 'lost', 'tales', 'will', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'abrupt']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales
1071474,A2HCWEQXB10TWE,B000PHX8RA,George Wood,"[4, 4]","When it was announced that J. Michael Straczynski was making a series of direct to DVD sequels to ""Babylon 5"", there must have been happy anticipation among fans of his sci-fi universe. Since ""Babylon 5"" came to the end of its 5 year run, all we've had is the sequel series ""Crusade"", which got canceled after 13 episodes and the pilot TV movie ""Legends of the Rangers"", which the Sci-Fi Channel declined to buy as a series.But the first disk of ""Babylon 5 The Lost Tales"" is a disappointment.Placed 10 years after President Sheridan's departure from Babylon 5, and the founding of the Interstellar Alliance, it brings back three actors, Bruce Boxleitner as Sheridan, Tracy Scoggins as (now Colonel) Elizabeth Lochley, and Peter Woodward, reprising his role as the Technomage Galen from ""Crusade"" and the TV movie that set up that series, ""A Call to Arms"".There are two separate 34 minute episodes on this DVD. The first features Lochley and a priest dealing with a demonic possession on the eve of the 10 anniversary ceremonies on Babylon 5, the second with Sheridan and Galen and a threat to the future of Earth, played out as Sheridan arrives for the festivities.At one point in the beginning of the second episode Sheridan remarks that Minbari are minimalists. That could be said for the entire production. It is obviously low budget, without enough funds to pay for many actors. There are only three real roles in part 1, and three main roles with two short cameos (one by Lochley) in part 2. There are a few external voices and a couple of people walk by in a few scenes.But instead of a people-filled Zocolo or C-in-C, all we get are a series of two person conversations in a few rooms. Occasionally there are three people in the conversation. Babylon 5 is supposed to be crowded, a quarter of a million people, all alone in the night. The place is empty here.The space effects are limited but fine as computer graphics are cheap. Actors cost money.The stories are also a bit thin. Each is only 34 minutes, shorter than the 40 to 45 minutes of an hour television show (without commercials). The demonic possession is not to be taken at face value in a universe filled with Shadows, Vorlans, rogue telepaths and other strangeness. The demon's story even sounds like a Christian take on the Shadow War of 1000 years ago.Especially strange is Lochley's suggestion that calling in a priest is one of the weirdest things she has ever done on Babylon 5. The whole conversation suggesting that priests are rare and that faith has declined as humanity has entered space is exactly the opposite of what we have seen in the earlier series. In several episodes there are vital human religious expressions, and alien species from Minbari to Narn hold fast to their spiritual traditions.One nice touch is when Lochley tells Sheridan that Dr Franklin has joined G'Kar in his journey beyond the rim. Since the actors playing those roles have died, they are indeed beyond, and we can only echo Sheridan's remark that he misses them.So a disappointment, but still not to be missed for a fan of the Babylon 5 universe. We can only hope that later episodes in this series bring in a few more actors.",2,A Major Disappointment,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,3187,"['When', 'was', 'announced', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'was', 'making', 'series', 'direct', 'DVD', 'sequels', 'Babylon', '5', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'anticipation', 'fans', 'sci-fi', 'universe', 'Babylon', '5', 'came', 'end', '5', 'year', 'run', ""'ve"", 'had', 'sequel', 'series', 'Crusade', 'got', 'canceled', '13', 'episodes', 'pilot', 'TV', 'movie', 'Legends', 'Rangers', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'declined', 'buy', 'series.But', 'first', 'disk', 'Babylon', '5', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'disappointment.Placed', '10', 'years', 'President', 'Sheridan', 'departure', 'Babylon', '5', 'founding', 'Interstellar', 'Alliance', 'back', 'three', 'actors', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'Sheridan', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'now', 'Colonel', 'Elizabeth', 'Lochley', 'Peter', 'Woodward', 'reprising', 'role', 'Technomage', 'Galen', 'Crusade', 'TV', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'series', 'Call', 'Arms', 'are', 'two', 'separate', '34', 'minute', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'first', 'features', 'Lochley', 'priest', 'dealing', 'demonic', 'possession', 'eve', '10', 'anniversary', 'ceremonies', 'Babylon', '5', 'second', 'Sheridan', 'Galen', 'threat', 'future', 'Earth', 'played', 'out', 'Sheridan', 'festivities.At', 'one', 'point', 'beginning', 'second', 'episode', 'Sheridan', 'remarks', 'Minbari', 'are', 'minimalists', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'entire', 'production', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'enough', 'funds', 'pay', 'many', 'actors', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'real', 'roles', 'part', '1', 'three', 'main', 'roles', 'two', 'short', 'cameos', 'one', 'Lochley', 'part', '2', 'are', 'few', 'external', 'voices', 'couple', 'people', 'walk', 'few', 'scenes.But', 'instead', 'people-filled', 'Zocolo', 'C-in-C', 'get', 'are', 'series', 'two', 'person', 'conversations', 'few', 'rooms', 'Occasionally', 'are', 'three', 'people', 'conversation', 'Babylon', '5', 'supposed', 'be', 'crowded', 'quarter', 'million', 'people', 'alone', 'night', 'place', 'empty', 'here.The', 'space', 'effects', 'are', 'limited', 'fine', 'computer', 'graphics', 'are', 'cheap', 'Actors', 'cost', 'money.The', 'stories', 'are', 'also', 'bit', 'thin', 'only', '34', 'minutes', 'shorter', '40', '45', 'minutes', 'hour', 'television', 'show', 'commercials', 'demonic', 'possession', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'universe', 'filled', 'Shadows', 'Vorlans', 'rogue', 'telepaths', 'other', 'strangeness', 'demon', 'story', 'even', 'Christian', 'take', 'Shadow', 'War', '1000', 'years', 'ago.Especially', 'strange', 'Lochley', 'suggestion', 'calling', 'priest', 'one', 'weirdest', 'things', 'ever', 'done', 'Babylon', '5', 'whole', 'conversation', 'suggesting', 'priests', 'are', 'rare', 'faith', 'declined', 'humanity', 'entered', 'space', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'earlier', 'series', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'vital', 'human', 'religious', 'expressions', 'alien', 'species', 'Minbari', 'Narn', 'hold', 'fast', 'spiritual', 'traditions.One', 'nice', 'touch', 'when', 'Lochley', 'Sheridan', 'Dr', 'Franklin', 'joined', ""G'Kar"", 'journey', 'rim', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'have', 'died', 'are', 'indeed', 'can', 'only', 'echo', 'Sheridan', 'remark', 'disappointment', 'still', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'fan', 'Babylon', '5', 'universe', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'later', 'series', 'bring', 'few', 'more', 'actors']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

Sheridan's story set up a potentially great new character in Prince Vintari and set up a dilema for Sheridan that was very well done. It was also cool to see Sheridan and Galen interact.

Yes, Babylon 5 was one of the best series ever to come to TV, we miss it, we want more, we feel that its sequel Crusade could have been just as great if given a chance, and a couple of the movies were also up to the high standard of the series.But then the fat lady should have sung -- and left us with our memories of a near-perfect, near-flawless series -- one to return to and watch on our tapes and DVDs and again enjoy and recall how great it was and how much we loved it. Better that than building up our hopes for more and then letting us down with this farce.I gave it a couple of stars because I thought the actors did a fine job and didn't even appear to be struggling, in spite of having nothing to work with and nothing to do. Tracy Scoggins certainly deserves several gold stars for surviving one of the most boring scripts ever written -- endless drivel based on tacky theology. Bruce Boxleitner is, well, Bruce -- just as delightfully crusty Sheridan as ever and the only bright spot present, though equally inflicted with nothing but talk and a sweetly corny resolution as to what to do with the Centauri prince.And where was the Babylon 5 station itself in all this? We got some beautiful outside shots of it, but inside? Bare blank nothing. This was supposed to be a big 10th anniversary shindig -- so where were all the people? There was nothing to indicate that a big glorious celebration was in progress. The Minbari ship was a little brighter and more colorful but again, hardly anybody was there.So -- sing on, fat lady.

I also thought it moving that as the movie began it ended where Season 5's Episode, Sleeping In Starlight, where the ships are leaving as Babylon5 is decommissioned, and G'kar's voice is speaking, and time is reversed back 10 years and we have a chance to see John Sheridan again.....His relationship with the Techo-mag, Galen.

While the premise may be utterly ridiculous, the guy playing the demon does as good a job as anyone possibly could have acting-wise and I was genuinely surprised to see the part pulled off so well. Will you be afraid of a guy with a scraggly little pubestache just because his eyes light up with flames? Probably not, but his delivery was at least good enough to keep me from cracking up constantly--more than can be said for Father rushed and over-rehearsed.The second story is better and more akin to what you would expect from a B5 episode, though I smelled the ending coming a mile away. No big whoop, but not bad, either, and certainly nothing worth getting furiously angry about on the internet. You can't cram 4 years worth of high school into a 4 hour reunion, so I'm not sure why anyone expects this single disc to accomplish a similar feat, but judging by the average angry reviewer's spelling abilities, I'd say most of the angriest have not actually graduated from high school.I wasn't too bothered by the pared-down cast myself, but I did feel like they kinda short-changed Andreas and Richard Biggs by limiting their respective memorials to just the actors the studio was willing to pay for. They obviously had to put SOMETHING down on this first disc since their departure, but it would have been nice if they would have been able to round up a few more stories from their fellow castmates for their official send-off.

1071486,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B000PHX8RA,John Kwok,"[4, 5]","In ""Babylon 5 - The Lost Tales: Voices in the Dark"", series creator J. Michael Straczynski does what he has done best, writing well-crafted tales about the nature of good and evil with crisp dialogue. This is especially true in the first tale, in which Babylon 5 station commander Colonel Elzabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins) and a Roman Catholic priest, Father Kelly (Alan Scarfe), must confront a demon-possessed EarthForce security officer stationed on Babylon 5; in conclusion, Lochley has a new appreciation of both Heaven and Hell. In the second, more expansive tale - which overlaps  chronologically with the first tale - President John Sheridan of the Interstellar Alliance (Bruce Boxleitner) travels from Minbar aboard a brand new Minbari warship, en route to the tenth anniversary celebration of the Interstellar Alliance's founding, which will be held on Babylon 5. He is warned by technomage Galen (Peter Woodward) of the potential danger posed by a young Centauri prince (Keegan MacIntosh) towards Planet Earth in the not-too-distant future, and Sheridan is confronted unexpectedly with a most personal moral dilemna, while serving as both the prince's host and guardian. He's also interviewed by an ISN reporter (Teryl Rothery, who's best known for portraying Dr. Janet Frazier on the ""Stargate SG-1"" television series). While both stories do not rank alongside the finest from the original ""Babylon 5"" series, they are still much better examples of science fiction storytelling than what I've seen on the last two ""Star Trek"" series. The special effects are also substantially better, offering more of a three-dimenstional quality to the ""Babylon 5"" space station. Long-time ""Babylon 5"" fans will also appreciate the video extras, including a memorial to deceased original cast members Andreas Katsulas (""G'Kar"") and Richard Biggs (""Dr. Stephen Franklin"").

Seems a bit like Star trek that way: the one movie is good, the next isn't. The psychological background that is JM Straczynski shows through in the story though: nothing in the beginning is as it seems. JMS takes you along and forces you to think along unfamiliar patterns.

I'm sure he has the scripts to do so!!While watching these 2 episodes PLEASE remember that what you are watching is AN EXPERIMENT!!! It's out there to ""test the waters"" more than anything else. The stuffed shirts that control the money could care less about the dedication of the fan base, the quality of the production, etc, etc, they ONLY care about the money...the PROFIT!!

1071489,A2VXXXY2LAKY1Z,B000PHX8RA,Kaymin,"[1, 2]","First off, I'm not a diehard fan of Babylon 5 or JMS.  I've seen the series twice and i know the show has it's flaws.  So I am neither going to give this 5 stars because it's B5 nor am I going to give it 1 star because I'm not a B5 fan.After reading some reviews, I thought the dvd would be absolutely horrible.  As it turned out, they're very watchable.  It's obvious that there is a very small budget to produce the show.  But while watching it, it provided me with fond memories of the original series and I wished that there would be a 3rd episode on this DVD.Yes, there are basically no sets at all in the entire dvd.  One scene was entirely in a black room.  However, the directing was actually pretty good in that the scenes were not cheesey.  Perhaps, because this dvd was fairly succesful in sales that the budget for future productions will be bigger.  This is hopefully just a start.I was very pleasantly surprised by the CGI in the dvd.  Babylon 5 looked pretty gorgeous to me.  The star furies put a huge smile on my face because they actually looked like fighters this time around and not big square tanks like in the original show.  For that alone watching the dvd is worth it.  Overall most of the CGI was very well done.  And the 60 or so second battle was absolutely impressive and gorgeous.  If further stories involved battle scenes like that then they are absolutely worth purchasing.Galen's acting was awesome.  I seriously do not remember him being so charming but he was.  Boxleitner was good as usual and really captured Sheridan.  On the other hand Lochley was rather rusty and her acting was worse than from the series.  And yes, she still doesn't seem to really fit in.The dialog wasn't that bad.  It's obvious JMS wanted to mention all the dead characters and I kind of smiled when it was mentioned that G'Kar was beyond the rim.  It's not terrible slapstick wise guy dialog that plagues almost every show nowadays like Stargate.Obviously, the budget was very small.  So how much could be done in terms of stories is debatable.  I'm sure JMS would've loved to put an epic battle or what not but where's the money?  The first story was a bit too religious and slow but it builds up to a somewhat decent ending.  The second story is much better than the first.  Not mind blowing but it's not the garbage that is released on tv nowadays.Oh and I must mention the music.  It was great.  The music fit in perfectly and was very reminiscent of B5 but much more modern.  The ending theme was a rendition of the season 5 opening theme and fit very well with President Sheridan's last scene.Maybe not 4 stars, but 3.5.  I really think this dvd is sort of like an introduction on what can be done later on in further dvds.  I feel JMS was restrained due to the very limited budget.  That is what I hope at least.  But not that terrible.  It is highly watchable especially if you're a B5 fan and usually i'm a somewhat harsh reviewer.",4,Lost tales isn't *that* bad - more of a introduction,1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,2952,"['First', ""'m"", 'not', 'diehard', 'fan', 'Babylon', '5', 'JMS', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'twice', 'i', 'know', 'show', 'flaws', 'am', 'neither', 'going', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'B5', 'am', 'going', 'give', '1', 'star', ""'m"", 'not', 'B5', 'fan.After', 'reading', 'reviews', 'thought', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'turned', 'out', ""'re"", 'very', 'watchable', 'obvious', 'very', 'small', 'budget', 'produce', 'show', 'watching', 'provided', 'fond', 'memories', 'original', 'series', 'wished', 'would', 'be', '3rd', 'episode', 'DVD.Yes', 'are', 'basically', 'sets', 'entire', 'dvd', 'One', 'scene', 'was', 'entirely', 'black', 'room', 'However', 'directing', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'cheesey', 'Perhaps', 'dvd', 'was', 'fairly', 'succesful', 'sales', 'budget', 'future', 'productions', 'will', 'be', 'bigger', 'hopefully', 'just', 'start.I', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'CGI', 'dvd', 'Babylon', '5', 'looked', 'pretty', 'gorgeous', 'star', 'furies', 'put', 'huge', 'smile', 'face', 'actually', 'looked', 'fighters', 'time', 'around', 'not', 'big', 'square', 'tanks', 'original', 'show', 'alone', 'watching', 'dvd', 'Overall', 'most', 'CGI', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', '60', 'so', 'second', 'battle', 'was', 'absolutely', 'impressive', 'gorgeous', 'further', 'stories', 'involved', 'battle', 'scenes', 'then', 'are', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'purchasing.Galen', 'acting', 'was', 'awesome', 'seriously', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'being', 'so', 'charming', 'was', 'Boxleitner', 'was', 'good', 'usual', 'really', 'captured', 'Sheridan', 'other', 'hand', 'Lochley', 'was', 'rather', 'rusty', 'acting', 'was', 'worse', 'series', 'yes', 'still', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'fit', 'in.The', 'dialog', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'obvious', 'JMS', 'wanted', 'mention', 'dead', 'characters', 'kind', 'smiled', 'when', 'was', 'mentioned', ""G'Kar"", 'was', 'rim', 'not', 'terrible', 'slapstick', 'wise', 'guy', 'dialog', 'almost', 'show', 'Stargate.Obviously', 'budget', 'was', 'very', 'small', 'So', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'terms', 'stories', 'debatable', ""'m"", 'sure', 'JMS', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'put', 'epic', 'battle', 'what', 'not', 'where', 'money', 'first', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'religious', 'slow', 'up', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'ending', 'second', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'Not', 'blowing', 'not', 'garbage', 'released', 'tv', 'nowadays.Oh', 'must', 'mention', 'music', 'was', 'great', 'music', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'B5', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'ending', 'theme', 'was', 'rendition', 'season', '5', 'opening', 'theme', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'President', 'Sheridan', 'last', 'scene.Maybe', 'not', '4', 'stars', '3.5', 'really', 'think', 'dvd', 'sort', 'introduction', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'later', 'further', 'dvds', 'feel', 'JMS', 'was', 'restrained', 'due', 'very', 'limited', 'budget', 'what', 'hope', 'least', 'not', 'terrible', 'highly', 'watchable', 'especially', ""'re"", 'B5', 'fan', 'usually', 'i', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'harsh', 'reviewer']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

Hearing how Andreas lived and created G'Kar was very emotional.

Everyone is Busy or in the case lost freinds (exploring beyond the rim)Some of the behind the scenes about the effects was more interesting than the effects. But it is free on the website.The script is awkward info dumps and scene setting lines tying long elegant Straczynski Soliloquy.. problem is that if you don't have an emotional bond to Lockley or Sheridan you wouldn't care at all.This is not something to show your non-B5 friends they will never sit down for one of the real episodes.Sorry to be the bearer of bad news as my best Christmas gift was the complete series on DVD.This was a high tech reading of Straczynski prose...Has B-5 run its cycle? is it impossible to go back?

Two excellent trilogies, the Psi Corps and the Centauri Prime books were published after the end of the show, but they didn't sell well and so no more were produced (there was another trilogy about the technomages, but I couldn't get into that one).With filmed entertainment, you have to confront actor availability, sets, production design, and other technical issues.  In a book, G'Kar and Dr. Franklin can live forever; on film, they're gone, as the actors have passed away.The idea of creating short films for direct-to-video release seems like a good one on paper, but this pair of stories has little to recommend it.  The first one is extremely slow and talky, and while it has the courage to bring up an interesting religious issue it does nothing new with the concept.The second piece starts equally slowly, and is redeemed only by an interesting performance by the actor who plays the son of the late Centauri emperor.  Sheridan has to confront a dilemma forced upon him by technomage Galen, but there's never any doubt what Sheridan will ultimately do.  Still, there's enough tension to keep the story going for the few minutes that remain.Because of the limitations of sets and crew, Babylon 5 feels ... abandoned.  There's a party going on, but the station still seems deserted.  There are no extras in the background loading cargo, or passengers arriving.  The epic sweep and texture of the series are not there.B5 worked best when the arc was fully engaged, when one mystery led to another, when the variety of characters both alien and human gave the story a mythic dimension.

In the second part, President Sheridan returns to Babylon 5 with the third-in-line successor to the Centauri throne knowing that as long as the latter lives, Earth's future may in jeopardy...It is such a pleasure to see Bruce Boxleitner, Tracy Scoggins, and Peter Woodward again though the (evidently) low budget and poor graphics are nothing to be proud of. Moreover, the two stories are told separately which makes the whole thing rather bland. On the other hand, the tribute to the late Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs was heart-warming and brought back wonderful memories; may they rest in peace.Finally, there are a lot of interesting extra features worth viewing, especially the interviews.In short, Babylon 5: The Lost Series though not a masterpiece is definitely worth watching and adding to your B5 collection.

Each episode is only a bit over a half-hour, and if you're a lifelong Babylon-5 fan you're likely to enjoy it if only for the bittersweet memories of those few years back in the 1990s when you couldn't wait for the next episode, and you felt so smart because so many of your friends simply didn't ""get it"" and perhaps couldn't ""get it"" if they tried because you had to really think about this show and preferably watch it from the beginning to ""get it"" at all.Well, those days are gone, so consider this a postcard from some old friends you haven't seen for ten years.

1071496,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B000PHX8RA,Little Roy Blue,"[2, 2]","""The Lost Tales"" represents a welcome - yet vaguely depressing - return to the universe of Babylon 5. The original series featured excellent writing and thought-provoking concepts, but failed to achieve mainstream success; so this low-budget DVD follow-up is clearly intended for the show's loyal fan base, and not for broad consumption. That's too bad, because Babylon 5 deserves a larger audience and a more prominent place in the annals of sci-fi pop culture.I gather that Warner Brothers gave Babylon 5's creator and head writer, Joe Straczynski, a very modest budget to produce ""The Lost Tales"" - a matched set of two short episodes, each featuring a character from the original series. Due to the lack of funds, the final product looks strikingly spartan; indeed, ""The Lost Tales"" features only minimal sets (plywood corridors, mainly) and almost no extras. The CGI special effects are quite good, but in all other respects this DVD production looks cheaper than the series that inspired it, which was plenty cheap to begin with.However, unlike some other reviewers, I think Straczynski did a pretty good job with this production, in spite of the obstacles he faced. Both of the mini-episodes presented here feature all the staples of the original series (good and bad) - clever dialog, solid characterization, occasional preachiness, and silly humor. As a result, ""The Lost Tales"" feels like *authentic* Babylon 5, even though it lacks the scope (and much of the cast) of the series.The first ""tale"" is admittedly a little odd, since it features prominent religious themes that are somewhat unprecedented for Babylon 5. Also, the character played by Tracy Scoggins is a relatively minor part of the show's universe, and I'd wager that most fans would have preferred to see characters such as Garibaldi or Londo featured instead. But, at its best, the story is clever and creepy. The second ""tale"" is more my cup of tea, as it features a major character (Captain Sheridan, played by the charismatic Bruce Boxleitner), and a compelling moral dilemma. Taken together, these stories hardly represent Babylon 5 at its best; but they are reasonably good.In summation, ""The Lost Tales"" is pretty compelling and very cheap - so, depending on your point of view, it either represents a laudable labor of love, or a crummy last stand for a TV show that always deserved more recognition than it got. But I must disagree with the opinion of fellow reviewer Jerry Kimball, who suggests that Babylon 5 has been ""surpassed"" by the likes of Firefly, Lost and Battlestar Galactica, making this production superfluous. I've always regarded Straczynski as a more thoughtful and serious sci-fi writer than the likes of Joss Whedon, J.J. Abrams, or Russell T. Davies - and while ""The Lost Tales"" isn't his best work, it does showcase his unique (and uniquely intelligent) approach to the genre. Babylon 5 hasn't been surpassed, because good writing never dates - so I will always appreciate the original series, just as I appreciate this well-intentioned but flawed attempt to resurrect it.",3,"Less than the franchise deserves, but enjoyable",1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,3076,"['Lost', 'Tales', 'welcome', 'yet', 'vaguely', 'depressing', 'return', 'universe', 'Babylon', '5', 'original', 'series', 'featured', 'excellent', 'writing', 'thought-provoking', 'concepts', 'failed', 'achieve', 'mainstream', 'success', 'so', 'low-budget', 'DVD', 'follow-up', 'clearly', 'intended', 'show', 'loyal', 'fan', 'base', 'not', 'broad', 'consumption', 'too', 'bad', 'Babylon', '5', 'larger', 'audience', 'more', 'prominent', 'place', 'annals', 'sci-fi', 'pop', 'culture.I', 'gather', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'gave', 'Babylon', '5', 'creator', 'head', 'writer', 'Joe', 'Straczynski', 'very', 'modest', 'budget', 'produce', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'matched', 'set', 'two', 'short', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'character', 'original', 'series', 'Due', 'lack', 'funds', 'final', 'product', 'strikingly', 'spartan', 'indeed', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'only', 'minimal', 'sets', 'plywood', 'corridors', 'mainly', 'almost', 'extras', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'other', 'respects', 'DVD', 'production', 'cheaper', 'series', 'inspired', 'was', 'plenty', 'cheap', 'begin', 'with.However', 'other', 'reviewers', 'think', 'Straczynski', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'production', 'spite', 'obstacles', 'faced', 'mini-episodes', 'presented', 'here', 'feature', 'staples', 'original', 'series', 'good', 'bad', 'clever', 'dialog', 'solid', 'characterization', 'occasional', 'preachiness', 'silly', 'humor', 'result', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'feels', '*authentic*', 'Babylon', '5', 'even', 'scope', 'much', 'cast', 'series.The', 'first', 'tale', 'admittedly', 'little', 'odd', 'prominent', 'religious', 'themes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'unprecedented', 'Babylon', '5', 'Also', 'character', 'played', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'relatively', 'minor', 'part', 'show', 'universe', ""'d"", 'wager', 'most', 'fans', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'characters', 'such', 'Garibaldi', 'Londo', 'featured', 'instead', 'best', 'story', 'clever', 'creepy', 'second', 'tale', 'more', 'cup', 'tea', 'major', 'character', 'Captain', 'Sheridan', 'played', 'charismatic', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'compelling', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'Taken', 'together', 'stories', 'hardly', 'represent', 'Babylon', '5', 'best', 'are', 'reasonably', 'good.In', 'summation', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'very', 'cheap', 'so', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'laudable', 'labor', 'love', 'crummy', 'last', 'stand', 'TV', 'show', 'always', 'deserved', 'more', 'recognition', 'got', 'must', 'disagree', 'opinion', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'Jerry', 'Kimball', 'who', 'Babylon', '5', 'been', 'surpassed', 'likes', 'Firefly', 'Lost', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'making', 'production', 'superfluous', ""'ve"", 'always', 'regarded', 'Straczynski', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'serious', 'sci-fi', 'writer', 'likes', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'Lost', 'Tales', ""n't"", 'best', 'work', 'showcase', 'unique', 'uniquely', 'intelligent', 'approach', 'genre', 'Babylon', '5', ""n't"", 'been', 'surpassed', 'good', 'writing', 'never', 'so', 'will', 'always', 'appreciate', 'original', 'series', 'just', 'appreciate', 'well-intentioned', 'flawed', 'attempt', 'resurrect']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

These are two, ~36 min. short stories, A-threads told in series.  We knew that going in.  JMS has said so, online, ever since this project was announced.  It's not what we're used to with respect to B5, & it's not what I prefer, BUT it IS what WB would finance, & what JMS would do at this time, after the deaths of John Sekka (Dr. Kyle), Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar), Tim Choate (Zathras) & Rick Biggs (Dr. Franklin), & with so much other stuff on JMS' plate (e.g. A-List feature films, etc.).JMS didn't have much to work with.  WB lost 100% of the CGI & had very little of the original wardrobe, sets & props available.  Also, this was a ""test-the-waters"" DVD (1st run eps. Direct-to-DVD), & the budget was obviously low, w/100% of the payback to come from DVD sales.  With no time or budget to rebuild the old B5 sets, they had to do most of the sets virtually via green screen.  Also, they had to go to the fan community to get CGI to use as a starting point, and for some wardrobe pieces.This didn't have a series startup budget, yet some people seem to have expected traditional B5, with full sets, props, wardrobe, cast, & an arc.  Their disappointment is the result of unrealistic expectations.Re. the two eps. on the DVD, I thought the acting was top notch.  Bruce & Peter were great, Tracy was good, & the guest actors (Alan Scarfe [Father Cassidy], Teryl Rothery [ISN reporter], Keegan MacIntosh [Vintari], & Bruce Ramsay [Burke] were all very good.

While I think the series is great, I have had a luck warm reaction to the movies and spin offs.  So, while I was quite anxious to watch this, I was afraid I might not like it.  Fortunately, my fears were for nothing.This DVD release is a combination of two short stories.  And with each one clocking around 35 minutes, I do mean short.  They are only slightly tied together.Up first, we find Colonel Lochley (Tracy Scoggins) dealing with a strange new force on the station.  In fact, she's called in a priest because it appears to be a demon possession.  Is that what it really is?  Should they try an exorcism?Of the two stories, I felt this one moved slower.  Still, it engaged me and I was quite into the story by the time it ended.  And the ending really amazed me again at JMS's storytelling abilities.The second story centers on President Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) and techno-mage Galen (Peter Woodward).  Sheridan is on his way to Babylon 5 for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the alliance.  Along the way, Galen appears to him with a vision of the destruction of the earth.  That destruction is still preventable.  Will Sheridan do what needs to be done to save Earth?This story felt even more like something from the Babylon 5 universe to me, and I quickly got into it.  The pace was fast and the emotion real.  I really liked it.The special effects on both of these stories were outstanding.  The show has always used cutting edge technology, and this DVD is no exception.  In fact, what is done here puts the series to shame.But the disc does have its flaws.  You can tell by the limited sets and set dressings what a small budget they had to work with.  Frankly, I missed most of the characters from the series, although I did like the references to them scattered throughout the film.  And the tributes to Richard Biggs and Andreas Katsulas, both during the show and in the extras, were truly moving.In the end, this is a disc for the series fans.  It's not as good as the series, but it's really very close and highly satisfying.",4,"Happily, I Enjoyed It",1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,2156,"['Just', 'ask', 'anyone', 'who', 'well', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Babylon', '5', 'think', 'series', 'great', 'have', 'had', 'luck', 'warm', 'reaction', 'movies', 'spin', 'offs', 'So', 'was', 'quite', 'anxious', 'watch', 'was', 'afraid', 'might', 'not', 'Fortunately', 'fears', 'were', 'nothing.This', 'DVD', 'release', 'combination', 'two', 'short', 'stories', 'one', 'clocking', '35', 'minutes', 'do', 'mean', 'short', 'are', 'only', 'slightly', 'tied', 'together.Up', 'first', 'find', 'Colonel', 'Lochley', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'dealing', 'strange', 'new', 'force', 'station', 'fact', 'called', 'priest', 'be', 'demon', 'possession', 'what', 'really', 'Should', 'try', 'exorcism', 'two', 'stories', 'felt', 'one', 'moved', 'slower', 'Still', 'engaged', 'was', 'quite', 'story', 'time', 'ended', 'ending', 'really', 'amazed', 'again', 'JMS', 'storytelling', 'abilities.The', 'second', 'story', 'centers', 'President', 'Sheridan', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'techno-mage', 'Galen', 'Peter', 'Woodward', 'Sheridan', 'way', 'Babylon', '5', 'celebration', '10th', 'anniversary', 'founding', 'alliance', 'way', 'Galen', 'vision', 'destruction', 'earth', 'destruction', 'still', 'preventable', 'Will', 'Sheridan', 'do', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'save', 'Earth', 'story', 'felt', 'even', 'more', 'something', 'Babylon', '5', 'universe', 'quickly', 'got', 'pace', 'was', 'fast', 'emotion', 'real', 'really', 'liked', 'it.The', 'special', 'effects', 'stories', 'were', 'outstanding', 'show', 'always', 'used', 'cutting', 'edge', 'technology', 'DVD', 'exception', 'fact', 'what', 'done', 'here', 'series', 'shame.But', 'disc', 'have', 'flaws', 'can', 'tell', 'limited', 'sets', 'set', 'dressings', 'what', 'small', 'budget', 'had', 'work', 'Frankly', 'missed', 'most', 'characters', 'series', 'did', 'references', 'scattered', 'film', 'tributes', 'Richard', 'Biggs', 'Andreas', 'Katsulas', 'show', 'extras', 'were', 'truly', 'end', 'disc', 'series', 'fans', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'series', 'really', 'very', 'close', 'highly', 'satisfying']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales
1071503,A11A8GWG0IXBZH,B000PHX8RA,"Mark Hills ""Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!""","[13, 13]","In many ways Babylon 5 was bungled from day one- not necessarily by the cast and crew, rather instead by the world-class batch of idiots who run Warner Brothers. What we got in the initial five year run was not what J. Michael Straczynski  had intended and foisting the 22-episode disaster that was Season 5 on us was just plain unfair. Stories abound on WB's executives how they have messed up many projects- Smallville, Teen Titans, Superman Returns- is it any wonder then that they couldn't manage to give JMS his full five years to tell the story he wanted and instead brought down to the wire each for each season and forcing him to alter the series as a result.  The Shadow War was supposed to last right through to end of Season 5, instead we get the worthless ponce Byron and the largely meaningless telepath war. Despite that, despite everything WB did to hamper the show, destroy it even, when Babylon 5 was bad it was still very good and when it was good, it was best science fiction ever seen on television, it's that simple.It's now been almost a decade since the series ended and there must be some lingering interest in it or else Lost Tales would never have seen the light of day. As I watched it for the first time a few days ago, a part me of wished it hadn't. It was almost painful to watch the movie, presented as a pair of vignettes, because it was very obvious that Warner Brothers had given J. Michael Straczynski almost nothing to work with in terms of money. There are almost no sets- a few corridors meant to be the interior of the Babylon 5 station, a jail cell and a few spartan hallways meant to be the interior of a Minbari cruiser. One of the aspects of Babylon 5 that I always appreciated was that no matter where the camera was you could always see people- humans and aliens- in the background, breathing life into the station, giving it a sense of being inhabited. In Lost Tales there is none of this, the station appears empty and lifeless. We do not see the CnC, the Zocolo or anything from the original series. What CG we get is excellent- the revamp of the station and space craft are incredibly well done- greater detail and very beautiful. But like the stories and everything else in Lost Tales, it just isn't enough.The first story deals with a man named Simon returning to the station after a vacation who appears to be possessed by a demon- not an alien, but an honest to goodness fire and brimstone `from the pits of Hell' demon. However, the story makes no sense once Colonel Elizabeth Lochley discovers the truth. Mankind has had space travel for two hundred years and the `demons' have been on earth the whole time and are just now making their presence known and moving into space? Sorry, that doesn't track.The second `tale' is about Sheridan as he travels to Babylon 5 for the tenth anniversary of the Interstellar Alliance and agrees to pick up Prince Vintari of the Centauri Republic while en route. Sheridan is visited by the technomage Galen who tells him that in thirty years time Vintari will destroy earth because the humans are the only force in the galaxy capable of stopping the Centauri from reclaiming their former glory- we knew the Minbari were dying out, but who knew it would happen this quickly? Galen then explains that Sheridan must kill Vintari and sets up an elaborate scheme to make it happen when the two dignitaries are transiting from the Minbari cruiser to the station.My theory is that JMS knew how much money he would be working with when he wrote the scripts (he also directed Lost Tales) and as a result got a this very weak offering. In my view, Babylon 5's fire has gone out of the universe and it's time is over, but it took Lost Tales to prove it. Maybe if there had been more money and a larger crew, something beautiful might have come of this. Instead we get an hour and half of mediocre story telling. If there is anything more to be done with Babylon 5 then perhaps WB needs to step forward with some dough and let J. Michael Straczynski tell the tales he wants instead of forcing him produce movies like this. Babylon 5 was never treated fairly, never got its due and now it looks like it never will.",2,Babylon 5 on a Shoestring,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,4190,"['many', 'ways', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'bungled', 'day', 'one-', 'not', 'necessarily', 'cast', 'crew', 'rather', 'instead', 'world-class', 'batch', 'idiots', 'who', 'run', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'What', 'got', 'initial', 'five', 'year', 'run', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'had', 'intended', 'foisting', '22-episode', 'disaster', 'was', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'unfair', 'Stories', 'abound', 'WB', 'executives', 'how', 'have', 'messed', 'up', 'many', 'projects-', 'Smallville', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'Superman', 'Returns-', 'wonder', 'then', 'could', ""n't"", 'manage', 'give', 'JMS', 'full', 'five', 'years', 'tell', 'story', 'wanted', 'instead', 'brought', 'down', 'wire', 'season', 'forcing', 'alter', 'series', 'result', 'Shadow', 'War', 'was', 'supposed', 'last', 'right', 'end', 'Season', '5', 'instead', 'get', 'worthless', 'ponce', 'Byron', 'largely', 'meaningless', 'telepath', 'war', 'everything', 'WB', 'did', 'hamper', 'show', 'destroy', 'even', 'when', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'when', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'simple.It', 'now', 'been', 'almost', 'decade', 'series', 'ended', 'must', 'be', 'lingering', 'interest', 'else', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'part', 'wished', 'had', ""n't"", 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'movie', 'presented', 'pair', 'vignettes', 'was', 'very', 'obvious', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'had', 'given', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'almost', 'nothing', 'work', 'terms', 'money', 'are', 'almost', 'sets-', 'few', 'corridors', 'meant', 'be', 'interior', 'Babylon', '5', 'station', 'jail', 'cell', 'few', 'spartan', 'hallways', 'meant', 'be', 'interior', 'Minbari', 'cruiser', 'One', 'aspects', 'Babylon', '5', 'always', 'appreciated', 'was', 'matter', 'where', 'camera', 'was', 'could', 'always', 'see', 'people-', 'humans', 'aliens-', 'background', 'breathing', 'life', 'station', 'giving', 'sense', 'being', 'inhabited', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'none', 'station', 'empty', 'lifeless', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'CnC', 'Zocolo', 'anything', 'original', 'series', 'What', 'CG', 'get', 'excellent-', 'revamp', 'station', 'space', 'craft', 'are', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done-', 'greater', 'detail', 'very', 'beautiful', 'stories', 'everything', 'else', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough.The', 'first', 'story', 'deals', 'man', 'named', 'Simon', 'returning', 'station', 'vacation', 'who', 'be', 'possessed', 'demon-', 'not', 'alien', 'honest', 'goodness', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'pits', 'Hell', 'demon', 'However', 'story', 'sense', 'once', 'Colonel', 'Elizabeth', 'Lochley', 'truth', 'Mankind', 'had', 'space', 'travel', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'demons', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'time', 'are', 'just', 'now', 'making', 'presence', 'known', 'moving', 'space', 'Sorry', ""n't"", 'track.The', 'second', 'tale', 'about', 'Sheridan', 'Babylon', '5', 'tenth', 'anniversary', 'Interstellar', 'Alliance', 'pick', 'up', 'Prince', 'Vintari', 'Centauri', 'Republic', 'en', 'route', 'Sheridan', 'visited', 'technomage', 'Galen', 'who', 'thirty', 'years', 'time', 'Vintari', 'will', 'destroy', 'earth', 'humans', 'are', 'only', 'force', 'galaxy', 'capable', 'stopping', 'Centauri', 'reclaiming', 'former', 'glory-', 'knew', 'Minbari', 'were', 'dying', 'out', 'who', 'knew', 'would', 'happen', 'quickly', 'Galen', 'then', 'Sheridan', 'must', 'kill', 'Vintari', 'up', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'make', 'happen', 'when', 'two', 'dignitaries', 'are', 'transiting', 'Minbari', 'cruiser', 'station.My', 'theory', 'JMS', 'knew', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'would', 'be', 'working', 'when', 'wrote', 'scripts', 'also', 'directed', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'result', 'got', 'very', 'weak', 'offering', 'view', 'Babylon', '5', 'fire', 'gone', 'universe', 'time', 'took', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'prove', 'Maybe', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'money', 'larger', 'crew', 'something', 'beautiful', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'Instead', 'get', 'hour', 'half', 'mediocre', 'story', 'telling', 'anything', 'more', 'be', 'done', 'Babylon', '5', 'then', 'perhaps', 'WB', 'step', 'forward', 'dough', 'let', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'tell', 'tales', 'instead', 'forcing', 'produce', 'movies', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'never', 'treated', 'fairly', 'never', 'got', 'due', 'now', 'never', 'will']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

The second story, centered on Boxleitner/Sheridan (good to see him in this role again!) was a tad better but centered around a teenager, thus seemed childish for the most part.  There were too few characters per story.  Each centered around only three to four actors with barely no extras or aliens.  B5 seemed virtually deserted. Special effects were good, particularly the beginning when B5 was destroyed and then taken back in time and reassembled. When scenes showed a mythical destruction of Earth, I wondered what happened to the Drak plague that was let loose in the last B5 TV movie? It seemed like JMS forgot about his own plotline!  So many of us were enthused about this revisit to our favorite SF show -- I think a good many will be disappointed.

While I enjoyed the episodes, my reaction was, ""Is that all?""I was expecting the Lost Tales to be something like the great TNT movies - a big tale told in the Babylon 5 universe. What I got was ""The Twilight Zone"". You can almost imagine the camera panning to Rod Serling (or Ed Wasser), who intones, ""Imagine if you will..."" It's a good approach and one I enjoyed once I'd gotten over the shock.So imagine if you will a Babylon 5 station worker who appears to be possessed. Colonel Lochley, desperate for help, calls a catholic minister for aide. Many have called this first part ""boring"". If so, then they must have found much of B5 boring, because it often dealt with quiet conflict and small stories (think ""Passing through Gethsemane""). Now imagine if you will being told a young man will grow up to kill millions. Could you kill that young man? This is the dilemma in the second episode. It's gotten better reviews partially because there's more action and noise. And partly because of the thrill of seeing Bruce Boxleitner in a Star Fury once more.I enjoyed both stories and found them to be well made. The F/X have kept up - B5 has never looked better. Good acting all around and solid directing. It would have placed both stories about the middle of the pack had they occurred during the series run. The fit in perfectly with B5 universe. The dialogue has that strong JMS touch, the conflicts are profound and the solutions might be a bit too easy and trite, I didn't feel cheated.But again, the episode are too short. 72 minutes and two small stories are not what I expected. I hope that we will see more of these in the future. But be aware that these are not the big grand TNT movies, no matter what the trailer promises.

That's all I needed to know.I should have waited.  i've never been so disappointed in my life.  The greatest has fallen.Firstly, let me tell you that there are two stories on this disk, plus a memorial on it called ""beyond the rim"" which is about Richard Bigg's and Andreas Kasulas, both who passed away after the series completed.  This is a nice memorial, but I would rather buy a disk marked just as a memorial to them than buy it as part of these ""lost tales"" as a side note.  It is a nice tribute and if you can catch it somewhere, fans will enjoy it.That said...these stories are LOW BUDGET, poorly written, and irritating. The idea here was to bring back the cast for a reunion.  but when only sheridan, lockley, and Galen are actually available for the reunion and they do not have the budget to rebuild those massive sets...you know that Lost Tales are a disaster waiting to happen.none of the splendor we are used to seeing is there.  None of the drama or the wonderful tete-a-tete from the characters.  Everything is dry, dull, contrived, forced.  It's just not believable.  I never felt like they were ever on the station.  Just in a warehouse in California.  The budget is just so low that I do not believe anyone.The two tales do not advance the plot or the storylines.  They are just there.

The Lost Tales are two separate stories titled Voices in the Dark: Over Here and Over There respectively. Both lasted 45 minutes, making this a short DVD.  The good things are that I got to see some of my favorite characters - Pres Sheridan, Col Lochley and Galen, the new Valen class cruiser was cool, and the special effects are better. However, what was not seen was the problem.  We didn't see any other major characters.  How can you have a movie without Delenn and Garibaldi?  The sets were terrible.  There were only about three different locales shown in both tales.  They did make a good attempt to explain this in tale 2 by saying that Minbari are minimalists.  The extras were neither good or bad and would be the only reason I would buy this.  The tributes to Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs are the best parts of the extras.  If like me, you must just see some B5 that you haven't seen yet, check your local library or rent it.

Yes, it is a continuation of B5, but at a greatly diminished scale. Each story only has a few characters acting on minimal or virtual sets. The first story is a tacky exorcist sort of thing that has no place in a scifi context. The second story, with Sheridan, is much better and almost worthy of the original show. Bruce B easily slips back into the role of Sheridan befriending a Centauri prince. I hope that the quality of the stories improves on following discs. A good point is that the special effects are much more sophisticated than those of the original show.",3,Better than Nothing,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,654,"['am', 'big', 'Babylon', '5', 'fan', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'DVD', 'reaction', 'quite', 'mixed', 'Yes', 'continuation', 'B5', 'greatly', 'diminished', 'scale', 'story', 'only', 'few', 'characters', 'acting', 'minimal', 'virtual', 'sets', 'first', 'story', 'tacky', 'exorcist', 'sort', 'thing', 'place', 'scifi', 'context', 'second', 'story', 'Sheridan', 'much', 'better', 'almost', 'worthy', 'original', 'show', 'Bruce', 'B', 'easily', 'back', 'role', 'Sheridan', 'befriending', 'Centauri', 'prince', 'hope', 'quality', 'stories', 'following', 'discs', 'good', 'point', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'original', 'show']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales
1071532,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000PHX8RA,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","Before I comment on the movie, I really liked a moment when a reporter, played by one of my most welcome character actresses, Teryl Rothery, asked Sheridan if G'Kar and Franklin would be attending the celebration of the alliance that was being held at BABYLON 5.  He replied no, that G'Kar was out exploring beyond the rim and that Franklin was with him.  This was, of course, a very subtle lament for the deaths of Andreas Katsulas in 2006 (to lung cancer) and Richard Biggs in 2004 (to an aortic dissection at the shockingly young age of 44).  Both were distinctive and likable actors.  Not many people are aware that Biggs was very close to being deaf, with the complete loss of hearing in one ear and partial hearing in the other.I personally enjoyed both of the ""tales"" making up this DVD despite the fact that they were not terribly good.  Both were very, very chatty and one finishes the disc without much of a sense that very much happened.  Still, I loved seeing Tracy Scroggins's Elizabeth Lochley, Bruce Boxleitner's President Sheridan, and Peter Woodward's Galen (one of the more important and compelling characters on the B5 spin off CRUSADE).  Neither story will rank very high in the annals of B5 lore, but I can't say that I regret that the DVD was made.  And as I said, it was great seeing people in roles we knew them from in the past.  And can I add that Tracy Scroggins looks amazingly good for a woman her age?  I'm sure that we all wished that we could age so gracefully as she.There has been a persistent problem in all the B5 movies.  The TV series always built its stories slowly.  Few of the standalone episodes were very interesting or even very good.  About the only one that was very good was one of the few written by someone other than Straczynski, a fifth season episode written by the great Neil Gaiman.  B5's excellence depended on slowly and meticulously told arcs that extended over long periods of time.  Its narrative style does not lend itself very well to the short form of a made for TV or made for DVD movie.So, this is a pleasant thing to see for fans of B5.  But I would ardently recommend that no one unfamiliar with the world of BABYLON 5 to watch it until after they've seen the series.  B5 is an unusual show.  It was at its best very good indeed, but it built up to excellence very slowly.  The first two seasons are, in fact, pretty dull affairs (though rewatching the series after having made it all the way to the end is actually more fun than watching it the first time through, since you see foretellings of things that will later happen).  But it definitely rewards those who stick it out until the end.  But this DVD offering unfortunately is mainly just a way to revisit that which has already passed on.  Not that I wouldn't delight in seeing another.",3,"Rather slow, but nonetheless a pleasant encounter with old friends",1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,2809,"['comment', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'moment', 'when', 'reporter', 'played', 'one', 'most', 'welcome', 'character', 'actresses', 'Teryl', 'Rothery', 'asked', 'Sheridan', ""G'Kar"", 'Franklin', 'would', 'be', 'attending', 'celebration', 'alliance', 'was', 'being', 'held', 'BABYLON', '5', 'replied', ""G'Kar"", 'was', 'out', 'exploring', 'rim', 'Franklin', 'was', 'was', 'course', 'very', 'subtle', 'lament', 'deaths', 'Andreas', 'Katsulas', '2006', 'lung', 'cancer', 'Richard', 'Biggs', '2004', 'aortic', 'dissection', 'shockingly', 'young', 'age', '44', 'were', 'distinctive', 'likable', 'actors', 'Not', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'aware', 'Biggs', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'deaf', 'complete', 'loss', 'hearing', 'one', 'ear', 'partial', 'hearing', 'other.I', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'tales', 'making', 'up', 'DVD', 'fact', 'were', 'not', 'terribly', 'good', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'chatty', 'one', 'disc', 'much', 'sense', 'very', 'much', 'happened', 'Still', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Tracy', 'Scroggins', 'Elizabeth', 'Lochley', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'President', 'Sheridan', 'Peter', 'Woodward', 'Galen', 'one', 'more', 'important', 'compelling', 'characters', 'B5', 'spin', 'off', 'CRUSADE', 'story', 'will', 'rank', 'very', 'high', 'annals', 'B5', 'lore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'regret', 'DVD', 'was', 'made', 'said', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'people', 'roles', 'knew', 'past', 'can', 'add', 'Tracy', 'Scroggins', 'amazingly', 'good', 'woman', 'age', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wished', 'could', 'age', 'so', 'gracefully', 'she.There', 'been', 'persistent', 'problem', 'B5', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'always', 'built', 'stories', 'slowly', 'Few', 'standalone', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'written', 'someone', 'other', 'Straczynski', 'fifth', 'season', 'episode', 'written', 'great', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'B5', 'excellence', 'depended', 'slowly', 'meticulously', 'told', 'arcs', 'extended', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'narrative', 'style', 'not', 'lend', 'very', 'well', 'short', 'form', 'made', 'TV', 'made', 'DVD', 'movie.So', 'pleasant', 'thing', 'see', 'fans', 'B5', 'would', 'ardently', 'recommend', 'one', 'unfamiliar', 'world', 'BABYLON', '5', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'B5', 'unusual', 'show', 'was', 'best', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'built', 'up', 'excellence', 'very', 'slowly', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'fact', 'pretty', 'dull', 'affairs', 'rewatching', 'series', 'having', 'made', 'way', 'end', 'actually', 'more', 'fun', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'foretellings', 'things', 'will', 'later', 'happen', 'definitely', 'rewards', 'who', 'stick', 'end', 'DVD', 'offering', 'unfortunately', 'mainly', 'just', 'way', 'revisit', 'already', 'passed', 'Not', 'would', ""n't"", 'delight', 'seeing']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

1071534,AY7XY9E1L6QRW,B000PHX8RA,ROBERT W. SAINT JOHN,"[7, 9]","Well this was a real treat for B5 fans! A spinoff of the original series that feels like the best of the original series. I was never all that fond of the spinoff projects (with the exception of the exceptional ""In the Beginning"") like ""River of Souls"", ""Thirdspace"" and (especially) ""Legend of the Rangers"". Despite having seen most of them 2 or 3 times, I found them unmemorable. And although ""Crusade"" had potential, it will always feel like unfinished business.But these new ""Lost Tales"" standalone stories really took me back to what was best about B5 when it was at its best. I thought the two stories were exceptionally clever and compelling, and the theme that seems to tie them (don't take choices at face value) reflects J. Michael Straczynski's writing at its best. Turns out he a pretty great director too!Other elements: video and audio quality was immaculate; visual effects were wonderful, it's so nice to see the B5 universe re-rendered with today's quality SFX; lovely score by Christopher Franke that has great subtle and epic moments; very good performances by most of the cast, especially Boxleitner and Woodward, who just slip back into their characters and feel like a comfy sweater; wonderful fanservice in the stories and in the extras (especially for our friends who have left us).My only criticism: I think they need more extras if there are more TLT DVDs (yes please!). The scenes on the station itself feel very sparse, like everyone is on vacation or something. It feels ""wrong"", especially when so many of the scenes are character and conversation heavy, small intimate scenes in rooms between two characters. The scenes in hallways and on the hanger of the station needed to be a reminder of not only how big the station is, but how busy it is as well. I think that without ""B stories"" in these scripts, that visual element would have heightened the drama of the smaller, more important scenes.I hope this is the first of many of these DVDs, thought I fear JMS is just going to be too darn busy with his exploding career to give us more.

Budget aside, The first part of these ""Lost Tales"" provoked my thoughts to another new perspective, and kept me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see the wonderful, albeit short, ending.  Acting is great and it was wonderful to see some familiar faces compliment the series with their presence (Alan Scarfe and Teryl Rothery).The Second part is definitely the Fan service.  from a plot line thought dead in season 4 giving a new seed (practically literally) to glimpses of these updated effects in a battle scene.

1071538,A2QDPJRVXL7P4F,B000PHX8RA,"Sahra Badou ""Bibliophile""","[4, 7]","I have to admit that I was never a fan of the TV series. I might have watched a few episodes when there was nothing else interesting on TV, but I never watched a complete season or felt the urge to buy or rent a complete season.Since I love watching sci-fi, I decided to buy this movie. Wow!!!!!! I loved it.This movie is really two different stories, and reminded me a little bit of the twilight zone. The first story deals with a demon, and was just amazing in its spiritual and religious message. The second story revolved around the ethical question of whether killing a person who might grow up to be a monster is ethical. If we knew that baby Hitler and baby Genghis Khan will grow up to be monsters, would it have been justified to kill them while they were still young and innocent? Can the future really be changed? Is hope always lean and on a diet?Though the second story was good but nothing really special, it is the first story of the demon that wins a five star rating. I have recently been reading a lot about religion, especially books by atheists. I am not an atheist, but I was very interested in how atheists think. Some of their arguments are pretty convincing. For example, why does God allow so much pain? The question of pain and suffering is what sways most people towards atheism. This movie tackles this problem wonderfully.The plot of the first story is as follows: Since man has journeyed deep in space, and found no angels and no God, his faith diminished to the point that priests became rare. However, a priest is called upon when a man is suspected of being possessed by a demonic spirit while aboard Babylon 5. The dialogue between the priest and the commander of Babylon 5 about God and atheism is just inspiring. It pretty much sums up everything I have been reading about atheism. But as you will see in the movie, the story takes a sharp twist. Is the demon really a demon? Do demons live in space, or were they cast away somewhere else by God? What's God's divine plan in creating demons in the first place?This movie will tackle many theological questions, and this makes it quite unique by sci-fi standards. This is a movie I'm sure I'll watch many times.",5,Theists vs. atheists!,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,2196,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', 'might', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'when', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'interesting', 'TV', 'never', 'watched', 'complete', 'season', 'felt', 'urge', 'buy', 'rent', 'complete', 'season.Since', 'love', 'watching', 'sci-fi', 'decided', 'buy', 'movie', 'Wow', 'loved', 'it.This', 'movie', 'really', 'two', 'different', 'stories', 'reminded', 'little', 'bit', 'twilight', 'zone', 'first', 'story', 'deals', 'demon', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'spiritual', 'religious', 'message', 'second', 'story', 'revolved', 'ethical', 'question', 'killing', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'monster', 'ethical', 'knew', 'baby', 'Hitler', 'baby', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'will', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'monsters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'justified', 'kill', 'were', 'still', 'young', 'innocent', 'Can', 'future', 'really', 'be', 'changed', 'hope', 'always', 'lean', 'diet', 'second', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'first', 'story', 'demon', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'have', 'recently', 'been', 'reading', 'lot', 'religion', 'especially', 'books', 'atheists', 'am', 'not', 'atheist', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'how', 'atheists', 'think', 'arguments', 'are', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'example', 'why', 'God', 'allow', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'question', 'pain', 'suffering', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'towards', 'atheism', 'movie', 'problem', 'wonderfully.The', 'plot', 'first', 'story', 'man', 'journeyed', 'deep', 'space', 'found', 'angels', 'God', 'faith', 'diminished', 'point', 'became', 'rare', 'However', 'priest', 'called', 'upon', 'when', 'man', 'suspected', 'being', 'possessed', 'demonic', 'spirit', 'aboard', 'Babylon', '5', 'dialogue', 'priest', 'commander', 'Babylon', '5', 'God', 'atheism', 'just', 'inspiring', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'everything', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'atheism', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'story', 'sharp', 'twist', 'demon', 'really', 'demon', 'Do', 'demons', 'live', 'space', 'were', 'cast', 'away', 'somewhere', 'else', 'God', 'What', 'God', 'divine', 'plan', 'creating', 'demons', 'first', 'place', 'movie', 'will', 'tackle', 'many', 'theological', 'questions', 'quite', 'unique', 'sci-fi', 'standards', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'many', 'times']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales
1071539,A2VLWXTQJMYHXD,B000PHX8RA,sam,"[1, 1]","just stick to the series.  There is a review on hear somewhere that gives the order to watch the series in.  HERE IT IS:First watch BABYLON 5: THE GATHERING from this boxed set. To be blunt, it is not very good at all. It is basically a pilot and not an especially compelling one. We meet some -- but by no means all -- of the important characters of forthcoming seasons, and get a taste of the B5 universe, but this is just a dull, chatty, uninteresting debut. And the make up for G'Kar looked like it was in planning stages! Very, very different from how he looked on the subsequent series.Next, watch Seasons One through Four of BABYLON 5 the series. The first season is slightly more interesting than the pilot, but not by much. Season Two gets slightly more interesting, especially near the end of the season when the Shadows plot really kicks into gear. From this point to the end of Season Four B5 is incredibly compelling. Just be patient watching the first two seasons. You'll start getting hints in Season Two of how good it will eventually get, but there will still be plenty of dullish episodes instead. The series is not terribly balanced because the network changed its plans a couple of times, first telling Straczynski that the series was going to wrap up at the end of Season Four and then, after he had collapsed two season's worth of stories into one, telling him that the show would be renewed for one more season. So much for planning.Next, before watching Season Five, watch another movie in this set, IN THE BEGINNING. This is far and away the best of the B5 movies and is fully as good and as entertaining as Seasons Three and Four. It goes back before the beginning of the series, giving the details of the Minbari was. But the narrative assumes you've seen the first four seasons.Next, watch Season Five of BABYLON 5. Because he really had a different story arc planned for Season Five one had to be created pretty quickly. The whole telepath arc simply never caught fire and it does not represent the best of B5. The last third of the season focuses on the decline and fall of Centauri Prime and this is B5 at its best. There are a string of very, very good episodes as well as a very beautiful series finale. Mention must also be made of a lovely episode in the first half of the season written by the great Neil Gaiman.Season Five was actually broadcast in split seasons and a couple of the movies -- THIRDSPACE and RIVER OF SOULS -- were broadcast before the series actually finished. Your call. Neither is all that great and neither really requires to be seen at a certain point.The next movie, however, BABYLON 5: A CALL TO ARMS, should be viewed after the end of the series and the previously mentioned movies, and before the series CRUSADE. This episode features Bruce Boxleitner very prominently as Sheridan and is probably his last great hurrah in the series. The movie introduces the new and highly advanced space ship Excalibur and deals with a Drakh attack on earth, infecting it with a slow-acting virus that will kill all life on earth if a cure is not found (but since B5 the TV series gave us multiple glimpses into the future, we know that doesn't happen). This required the need for a search for a cure for the virus, a search that was continued on the quickly cancelled CRUSADE. The show never really got off the ground, but it had some interesting characters (especially Galen, played by Peter Woodward, who also appeared in the films A CALL TO ARMS and LOST TALES). I do recommend that fans of B5 see CRUSADE.The next movie was THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS: TO LIVE AND DIE IN STARLIGHT. Horrible. This is the worst of all the B5 movies, the worst thing ever done in the entire run of the show. I honestly don't even recommend this for fans of the show. The most I can say in support of it is that it is one's last chance to see Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar. He died a couple of years later of lung cancer.Last, and not quite least, there is 2007's THE LOST TALES. It is definitely not as bad as THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS, but not as good as IN THE BEGINNING. My reaction was that it was nice to see some familiar characters again (mainly just Tracy Scoggins's Captain Lochley, Bruce Boxleitner's Sheridan, and Peter Woodward's Galen). But definitely not B5 at its best. Most fans describe it as &#34;chatty.&#34; There are entire scenes devoted to nothing but talk, and not terribly good talk at that.A lot to see. For me the heart consists of the end of Season Two, all of Seasons Three and Four, the movie IN THE BEGINNING, and the last third of Season Five. My advice to anyone newly approaching B5 is to stick it out through it all. Much of it is dull, some of it even downright bad, but the best is very good indeed. If you are patient, you will find your patience rewarded.",3,lost for a reason,1355702400,"12 17, 2012",2012,4822,"['just', 'stick', 'series', 'review', 'hear', 'somewhere', 'order', 'watch',

I think most of my criticism stands, but might have been over the top.My original review is as follows:I am a Babylon 5 fan. Actually, the reason I bought my first DVD player was to be able to watch the original series. I have seen every installment more times than I would like to admit. With the possible exception of The Legend of the Rangers, I have always been quite happy with all things B5. Heck, I even thought that Crusade was starting to pick-up when it was cancelled.Here goes... The Lost Tales is absolutely terrible. Owch, that really hurts to type. I simply could not bring myself to rate any B5 production with only one star, but that really is the rating it deserves.Less talk and more explosions. It really is just that simple. B5 has always been an intelligent show. The original series had a great balance between drama and action. Lack of this balance is what separates this film from the good old stuff. Obviously, The Lost Tales suffered from a pitiful budget, but the writing should not have been poor as a result of that fact. JMS has written many, many good things in his career; this is just not one of them.With all of that being stated, the few CG shots offered were really nice. The exterior shots of the station were lovely.To conclude, I have certainly not given up hope on the quality of any upcoming B5 projects, but this was truly painful to watch.",2,"Less talk, more explosions",1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,1523,"['Make', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'revised', '1/6/08', 'veiwing', 'title', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'feel', 'was', 'bit', 'harsh', 'original', 'review', 'think', 'most', 'criticism', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'top.My', 'original', 'review', 'am', 'Babylon', '5', 'fan', 'Actually', 'reason', 'bought', 'first', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'original', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'installment', 'more', 'times', 'would', 'like', 'admit', 'possible', 'exception', 'Legend', 'Rangers', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'quite', 'happy', 'things', 'B5', 'Heck', 'even', 'thought', 'Crusade', 'was', 'starting', 'pick-up', 'when', 'was', 'cancelled.Here', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'Owch', 'really', 'type', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'bring', 'rate', 'B5', 'production', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'really', 'rating', 'deserves.Less', 'talk', 'more', 'explosions', 'really', 'just', 'simple', 'B5', 'always', 'been', 'intelligent', 'show', 'original', 'series', 'had', 'great', 'balance', 'drama', 'action', 'Lack', 'balance', 'what', 'film', 'good', 'old', 'stuff', 'Obviously', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'suffered', 'pitiful', 'budget', 'writing', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'poor', 'result', 'fact', 'JMS', 'written', 'many', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'career', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'them.With', 'being', 'stated', 'few', 'CG', 'shots', 'offered', 'were', 'really', 'nice', 'exterior', 'shots', 'station', 'were', 'lovely.To', 'conclude', 'have', 'certainly', 'not', 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'quality', 'upcoming', 'B5', 'projects', 'was', 'truly', 'painful', 'watch']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales
1071541,A1NDYD4JKKY9LE,B000PHX8RA,"Sarah Marie ""sarah_marie""","[5, 8]","The Lost Tales consists of two stories. The first one revolves around a demon taking over the body of a human, and Capt. Lochley's working with a priest to determine just what they need to do about that possession.The story is almost all talk with very limited action. It really involves only three characters and, for that reason alone, if no other, does not even begin to live up to the quality of the ""original"" Babylon 5. The show almost always involved a number of characters playing off each other, and the viewer was treated to a wide variety of views, ideas, thoughts, clashes, etc.To limit an episode to only a few people, and then to have almost the entire episode be limited to philosophical banter, creates an episode which is, essentially, very dull.The philosophical/spiritual approach was done well in episodes like ""Soul Hunter"" and ""The Parliament of Dreams."" This movie section is but a shadow of what has gone before.This doesn't count the fact that the very appearance of the station interior has changed too much. Originally, the station had basically a ""lived-in"" look. It was sort of dirty and run-down in a few places, and that made it more believable. The Babylon 5 in this special production is so neat and clean I almost expect to see some kind of droids walking by all the time with brooms and dust pans.The second story involves Sheridan and Galen, the Techno-mage. There's a Centauri that, if a few decades, could become responsible for the destruction of earth. Sheridan has to decide what needs to be done about that.The story is better done than the first story. The characters are more interesting, there is a mix of action and talk, and the story is more believable than the other story.Still, The Lost Tales doesn't really work.  It's sort of like it's an aside to Babylon 5, and not really Babylon 5. Another thing that's sort of bothersome; it's almost an all-human movie. Granted, there is one Centauri, but all the rest of the characters that actually do anything are human (well, one possessed human). One of the best things about the original Babylon 5 was seeing the interactions between the various aliens and the aliens and the humans. This is down to a very minimal level in this movie.The whole thing is basically an excellent example of the saying ""you can never go home again.""

I liked B5 from the first episode, but this DVD feels like a blatant rip-off of that audience. It just isn't worth the money, and buying it will only encourage more of the same. If they do more episodes (especially if they are halfway decent), and release them all as a DVD, maybe that will be worth watching (and buying).",2,"$1.99 at iTunes, sure... $16 bucks, no way...",1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,822,"['CGI', '=', 'good', 'limited.Actors', '=', 'OK', 'good', 'were', 'bit', 'stiff', 'none', 'were', 'painful.Storyline', '=', 'weak', 'best', '1st', 'part', 'was', 'totally', 'outside', 'B5', ""'universe"", 'agree', 'lead', 'review', 'really', 'down', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'single', 'episode', 'watching', 'kept', 'going', 'DVD', 'thinking', 'there', 'had', 'be', 'more', 'what', ""'d"", 'heard', 'was', 'envisioning', 'something', 'more', 'lines', 'Sin', 'City', 'several', ""'episodes"", 'linked', 'together', 'common', 'narrative', 'liked', 'B5', 'first', 'episode', 'DVD', 'feels', 'blatant', 'rip-off', 'audience', 'just', ""n't"", 'worth', 'money', 'buying', 'will', 'only', 'encourage', 'more', 'same', 'do', 'more', 'episodes', 'especially', 'are', 'halfway', 'decent', 'release', 'DVD', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'buying']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

Naimpally ""avid music and movie fan""","[3, 5]","This direct to DVD effort is an attempt to appease the legions of fans, like me, who have been clamouring for more Babylon 5 (""B5"").  As such, it should be viewed more as a proof of concept than a full-fledged return to the good old days of B5.  If this DVD sells well then, hopefully, the budget will get bigger, and the stories more complex in future offerings.  Viewed from this standpoint, this DVD succeeds in whetting the appettite for more.The budget constraints are very obvious in this initial offering.  Only three of the main actors from the original series participate, the sets are very spare, and the plots fairly simplistic.  B5 had a great ensemble cast, but unfortunately, two of the actors who created some of the most memorable characters, Andreas Katsulas (""G'Kar""), and Richard Biggs (""Dr. Franklin""), passed away, and are no longer available to participate.  The starkness of the scenes is somewhat disappointing, but understandable when you realize that new sets had to be built from scratch.  In addition, there are never more than three poeple in a scene at any one time, giving it the feel of a play rather than a television series.Despite all the limitations though, it is a good first effort, and one which I hope will be followed by more installments.  I hope more of the original cast will participate, and the budget will get bigger.  I sincerely hope that one of the networks decides to get involved and throws some serious money so that this project can prosper and bloom to its full potential.  Considering the many successful science fiction shows on various networks such as SciFi's Battlestar Galactica, USA's 4400, and NBC's Heroes, I hope someone will see the potential for this and pick it up.In the meantime, please BUY THIS DVD and support this new project!",4,"""Diet"" Babylon 5 - Tastes great, but less filling than the original.",1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,1799,"['direct', 'DVD', 'effort', 'attempt', 'appease', 'legions', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'clamouring', 'more', 'Babylon', '5', 'B5', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'more', 'proof', 'concept', 'full-fledged', 'return', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'B5', 'DVD', 'well', 'then', 'hopefully', 'budget', 'will', 'get', 'bigger', 'stories', 'more', 'complex', 'future', 'offerings', 'Viewed', 'standpoint', 'DVD', 'whetting', 'appettite', 'more.The', 'budget', 'constraints', 'are', 'very', 'obvious', 'initial', 'offering', 'Only', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'original', 'series', 'participate', 'sets', 'are', 'very', 'spare', 'plots', 'fairly', 'simplistic', 'B5', 'had', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'unfortunately', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'created', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Andreas', 'Katsulas', ""G'Kar"", 'Richard', 'Biggs', 'Dr.', 'Franklin', 'passed', 'away', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'participate', 'starkness', 'scenes', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'understandable', 'when', 'realize', 'new', 'sets', 'had', 'be', 'built', 'scratch', 'addition', 'are', 'never', 'more', 'three', 'poeple', 'scene', 'one', 'time', 'giving', 'feel', 'play', 'rather', 'television', 'series.Despite', 'limitations', 'good', 'first', 'effort', 'one', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'followed', 'more', 'installments', 'hope', 'more', 'original', 'cast', 'will', 'participate', 'budget', 'will', 'get', 'bigger', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'one', 'networks', 'get', 'involved', 'serious', 'money', 'project', 'can', 'prosper', 'bloom', 'full', 'potential', 'Considering', 'many', 'successful', 'science', 'fiction', 'shows', 'various', 'networks', 'such', 'SciFi', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'USA', '4400', 'NBC', 'Heroes', 'hope', 'someone', 'will', 'see', 'potential', 'pick', 'up.In', 'meantime', 'please', 'BUY', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'support', 'new', 'project']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

The noisy, densely populated (remember 250,000 humans and aliens?) Babylon 5 space station now seems eerily silent.  You never see more than three people in a room and most of those people don't have any speaking parts.There's no real action in this movie and we have far more monologue than we do dialog.  The sets are minimalist as is the cast.  There are only three characters that you'll recognize from the show, and the rest of the cast comes to five or six people.The first part of the movie is a preachy, heavily religious piece of script that was pointless and a waste of time.  It was painful to watch and it was easily the worst script Tracy Scoggins has ever been forced to read.Bruce Boxleitner doesn't show up until almost halfway into the movie and his lines aren't much better.The movie is only an hour and twelve minutes long, however the story unwinds so slowly and is so painful to watch it seems more like three hours and twelve minutes.The ending is extremely anti-climactic and even as the ending credits are rolling down the screen, you find yourself asking, ""is that it?

1071555,A3NAK0QG32XFKL,B000PHX8RA,"Tefilo de Jess ""Vivificat's blogmaster""","[1, 4]","Before I review of J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5: The Lost Tales recently released directly to DVD, I want to say a word about Babylon 5 (B-5). Yes, I am a fan. I started watching at the prompting of a co-worker who has since moved on to bigger and better things in the service of our country. I watched, and I was intrigued. My first impression was not entirely positive. I thought that it was sci-fi on the cheap, and knee-jerk reaction to Star Trek: Deep Space 9, a show I was back then getting into, Trekkie that I was and continue to be. Some of the wardrobe and the makeup seemed to me exaggerated and ridiculous. This Londo Mollari character, for example, seemed to me out of the court of Louis XIV and this notion of a ""republic"" led by a monarchic emperor seemed to me contradictory. Yet...there was something about it...and it was the story.Like Mr. Straczynski has said many times before, B-5 has a beginning, a middle point, and an end. It was a story meant to be told in 5 years. What a story it was. I think it was one of the most intelligent sci-fi shows ever made. Nothing was lost in the dialogue and the characters, they were human, even the aliens, each one extraordinarily gifted and profoundly flawed. They all meshed together and each character grew from their mutual interactions and it was a joy to see.B-5 was a morality tale, a fight of darkness against the light, of good versus evil; even those who represented evil had a dark aura and those who stood for evil and conflict were able to make a plausible argument for the morality of their actions.B-5 was deeply spiritual too. A strange work, deeply respectful of all religions and spiritualities, but particularly of Catholicism; a work that has come out from a declared atheist. Straczynski treats religion in general, and Catholicism in particular, with the utmost respect. Several B-5 episodes have a clear Catholic subtheme, for in B-5's universe, the Church survives and still has something to say, unlike in Star Trek and other shows, where religion has been subsumed into a vague mysticism tinged with ""spirituality,"" the thing Hollywood wants us to swallow in order to grow from ""superstition"" and ""fundamentalism"" into the light of ""tolerance"" and ""openness."" Phoey!  I thank God - because there is a God - for Straczynski, a living example proving than an atheist doesn't have to be a sophomoric, pompous jerk towards religion and believing people, that at least one can treat the subject with respect. Eat that, Dawkins, Harris, et al.In many instances, Catholics have been heroes in B-5, always portrayed in a most positive light, unafraid to face the deep of questions posed by a Universe that is very, very big. Catholic allusions are also galore. Which takes us to these two episodes bundled in this Babylon 5: The Lost Tales DVD. Once again, good faces evil.The stories are set ten years before the series finale. In the first episode, Over Here, Colonel Lockley, B-5's commanding officer, sends for a Catholic priest to face a a new evil at the station, the kind that only a Catholic priest is qualified to face. What will that be? I can tell you, but then I would spoil it. I will say this: the story resonated with allusions to C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy.In the second story, Over There, John Sheridan, former B-5 commander and President of the Interstellar Alliance (I.A.), heads to B-5 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the I.A. But then Galen, the technomage, shows him a future in which Earth is destroyed by a sneak Centauri attack, led by a future Emperor who is now Sheridan's own guest. The young man is untested, and he could go either way: he could become a genocidal sociopath but he also shows a surprising openness to good and kindness. What will Sheridan do?Let me finish by saying this: I love Star Trek, and I own some of the movies, and at least one of the ""fan continuum"" DVDs. But I own the entire B-5 series, the made-for-tv movies and now this one. I find them intelligent, challenging, and delight to watch.

1071556,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B000PHX8RA,The Mysterious Traveler,"[0, 0]","BABYLON 5: THE LOST TALES-VOICES IN THE DARK(2007) Produced,Directed and Written by J. Michael Straczynski. Score by Christopher Franke.Starring Bruce BoxLeitner, Peter Woodard and Tracy Scoggin.The latest attempt to restart the series--this time eschewing the wicked(and dumb) networks) and create a series of direct to video movies featuring stories with the favorite characters(and actors still living) set some time after the fifth season and CRUSADE. In this case about eight years later.In effect a more elaborate version of a typical side A/B ep, the film is a two story anthology featuring two tales happening simoultaneously but unrelated yet both concerning important moral/religious questions and how the characters react to them.The first story concerns Elizabeth Lockley who has been forced to summon a Catholic priest to the station to perform an exorcism when confronted with what appears to be(and is) a demonic possession. A superb story in every possible respect that also happens to be a wildly intelligent and imaginative examination of what would happen to Christianity as man expanded out to the stars and did not find heaven. This story--written by all reports an agnostic---is simply the best exploration of demonic and theological horror since EXORCIST 3 and shows what can be accomplished when the creative force behind the story simply chooses not to be an ignorant hate filled bigot and just tell a good story. To wit; it is not required to believe in werewolves to tell a good werewolf story. Straczynski--as happened in THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS with ghosts--casually concedes the existence of demons.....and therefore Satan.......and therefore God. Something that would NEVER happen in modern genre film be it STAR TREK or anything else. This is, of course, true creative courage and freedom unlike the mindless frightened conformity that passes for the American Artistic community today.The second and moderately less interesting(but only in comparion to the first story) tale concerns the old chestnut of Would you kill Hitler as a child if you had the chance? Very well done and---as per BABYLON 5--the story does not take the easy STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION way out--which would be to have the hero chicken out but then have the Hitler immediately slip on a bannana peel and fall down the stairs. BABYLON 5 never takes the easy way out.A superb pilot film and hopefully a successful relaunch. More films in this series would be welcome.What Sci Fic either film of TV should be.",3,The best of the post series telifilms and good Sci Fic in its own right as well as being of interest to Christians and Jews.,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,2515,"['5', 'LOST', 'TALES-VOICES', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARK', '2007', 'Produced', 'Directed', 'Written', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'Score', 'Christopher', 'Franke.Starring', 'Bruce', 'BoxLeitner', 'Peter', 'Woodard', 'Tracy', 'Scoggin.The', 'latest', 'attempt', 'restart', 'series', 'time', 'eschewing', 'wicked', 'dumb', 'networks', 'create', 'series', 'direct', 'video', 'movies', 'featuring', 'stories', 'favorite', 'characters', 'actors', 'still', 'living', 'set', 'time', 'fifth', 'season', 'CRUSADE', 'case', 'eight', 'years', 'later.In', 'effect', 'more', 'elaborate', 'version', 'typical', 'side', 'A/B', 'ep', 'film', 'two', 'story', 'anthology', 'featuring', 'two', 'tales', 'happening', 'simoultaneously', 'unrelated', 'yet', 'concerning', 'important', 'moral/religious', 'questions', 'how', 'characters', 'react', 'them.The', 'first', 'story', 'concerns', 'Elizabeth', 'Lockley', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'summon', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'station', 'perform', 'exorcism', 'when', 'confronted', 'what', 'be', 'demonic', 'possession', 'superb', 'story', 'possible', 'respect', 'also', 'be', 'wildly', 'intelligent', 'imaginative', 'examination', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Christianity', 'man', 'expanded', 'out', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'heaven', 'story', 'written', 'reports', 'agnostic', '-is', 'simply', 'best', 'exploration', 'demonic', 'theological', 'horror', 'EXORCIST', '3', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'when', 'creative', 'force', 'story', 'simply', 'not', 'be', 'ignorant', 'hate', 'filled', 'bigot', 'just', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'wit', 'not', 'required', 'believe', 'werewolves', 'tell', 'good', 'werewolf', 'story', 'Straczynski', 'happened', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'THE', 'RANGERS', 'ghosts', 'casually', 'existence', 'demons', '..and', 'therefore', 'Satan', '.and', 'therefore', 'God', 'Something', 'would', 'NEVER', 'happen', 'modern', 'genre', 'film', 'be', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'anything', 'else', 'course', 'true', 'creative', 'courage', 'freedom', 'mindless', 'frightened', 'conformity', 'American', 'Artistic', 'community', 'today.The', 'second', 'moderately', 'less', 'interesting', 'only', 'comparion', 'first', 'story', 'tale', 'old', 'chestnut', 'Would', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'child', 'had', 'chance', 'Very', 'well', 'done', '-as', 'BABYLON', '5', 'story', 'not', 'take', 'easy', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'THE', 'NEXT', 'GENERATION', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'hero', 'chicken', 'out', 'then', 'have', 'Hitler', 'immediately', 'slip', 'bannana', 'peel', 'fall', 'down', 'stairs', '5', 'never', 'easy', 'way', 'superb', 'pilot', 'film', 'hopefully', 'successful', 'relaunch', 'More', 'films', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'welcome.What', 'Sci', 'Fic', 'film', 'TV', 'should', 'be']",Babylon 5: The Lost Tales

I own the entire Babylon-5 series collection and the special feature movies. ""NONE"" were ever made as low budget as Lost Tales. The 2007 episode of Babylon-5: The Lost Tales, has a 15 minute story line stretched into 60 minutes using very few props - and I do mean very few. And for the most part... there's only three actors - 5-total.But... in the special features section on the DVD there's a memorial/tribute for two of the original main actors who have past away, G'Kar in 2006, and Dr. Stevens in 2004.

1071558,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000PHX8RA,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[1, 1]","When I first got into B5, I was so excited that there was a show that actually allowed its characters to change and develop over time. It was a show that actually had a beginning, middle and end all planned out at the beginning. It was a show where Villains could become Victims and then Holy Men. The comic relief could turn evil and then tragically heroic. Things actually happened. At the time, science fiction was trapped in the permanent Star Trek loop where everything had to return to normal at the end of the episode and nothing could ever change too much. After the show, there came a lot of shows likeBuffy the Vampire Slayer  - The Complete Fifth Season (Slim Set)andLost - The Complete First Seasonspecifically created to change and develop over time. You could say that this is part of the DVD revolution where producers are forced to create shows that people can watch all at once like a novel, but I still say that Babylon Five was the first.So I loved the show. And I really wish thatCrusade - The Complete Serieshad the chance to develop as a series. To this day it's one of the great ""unfinished"" series likeFirefly - The Complete SeriesorFreaks and Geeks: The Complete Scripts, Volume 1 (Newmarket Shooting Script)- shows that really needed more time to develop (although Freaks & Geeks really ended well). And I had high hopes for the movies and the Rangers pilot (which I still haven't seen.) And I read the later books that fleshed out the fates of the Technomages, the Centauri Empire and Bester. It was so nice to see books that were linked to the series that actually stayed with the series and didn't read like bad fan fiction. Not only was the show exciting in its own right, the episode at the end of season 4 that went 1000 years in the future to tell us what happened to this universe was particularly compelling.So what about this show? It's disappointing. The MAIN strength in B5 was the way it allowed the characters to change and develop over time. There were many weaknesses and many weak episodes, but overall it was a better than the sum of its parts. You aren't going to get that with this DVD. JMS says that he is only interested in writing self-contained short stories. He's not interested in painting on a huge canvas. The Telepath War might one day get told in a feature film but that's been coming for years. The two stories are clever and character-driven but they don't read like self-contained stories that aren't much better than merely passable episodes from the series. Lochley encounters a demon and has a lot of discussions about theology. Sheridan is presented with a dilemma similar to the one presented inThe City on the Edge of Forever: The Original Teleplay that Became the Classic Star Trek Episode; but not as compelling. It's an hour and fifteen minutes of merely ok television.Peter Woodward has some great scenes with Bruce Boxleitner and I do love the fact that Sheridan reacts to the Technomage with frustrated crabbiness. B5 was always great for touches where you think that people are going to react one way because that's the way the react in all these stories and they don't. In the case of Sheridan, he gets cranky about the technomages pushing him around and Galen gets sarcastic. The line ""No. I'm just showing you this because it's inevitable and I want to see your expression."" is perfect.However, the special features are great. JMS talking about how he saw that the extras playing the various aliens ate with their fellow aliens at lunch when they were on break. He even took a Narn extra and made him into a Centauri and watched what happened (apparently the former Narn spent one day eating with his old Narn comrades and then went over to the Centauri lunch table. And please note that these are the ACTORS playing the Narns and Centauri. On their breaks.) The running joke abotu sock puppets is great. And the memorial to Richard Biggs and Andreas Katulas is heartbreaking. JMS is a warm and funny individual and his interviews make me miss the days when I used to go to the Lurker's Guide every day for new insights into the previous shows.So overall. The show itself is disappointing, but if you're a B5 fan, the extras do make the DVD worth buying.",3,Really only for the completist.
