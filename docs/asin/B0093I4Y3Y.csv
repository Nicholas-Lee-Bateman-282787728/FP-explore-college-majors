If you've never seen it, give it a try, this '95 release is a particularly good place to start.  It features Foggy in tip top form, I've always liked the older Foggy more than the younger Foggy from the '70's, but he's superb no matter what the age.  OK, enough for the review, here's what you want, Information.This release will include a ""dizzyingly comical Christmas Special"".  This is the first time this January 1995 ""Special"" ""Man Who Nearly Knew Pavarotti"" has been released commercially in the U.S.  OK, here's the rundown:The Man Who Nearly Knew Pavrotti - This January 1995 ""Christmas Special"" episode features one of several guest appearances by Norman Wisdom, as bumbler Billy Ingleton. Billy finds a piano, and as it has always been his dream to play professionally, the trio organise a piano recital. But when he's in the spotlight, Billy faints from stage fright. Luckily, Compo has an idea up his sleeve.The Glory Hole - Foggy sets out to relive his days in World War II, after seeing a holein the road, which made him think of trenches!Adopted by a Stray - The trio meet a man who is throwing out his van, as he intends to live as a hermit. He happily gives them his van- but they didn't expect his wife to come with it!The Defeat of the Stoneworm - Howard arranges a secret method of communication with Clegg- tapping through the walls. When Pearl almost catches him in the act, he invents a household pest called stoneworm, and, out of sympathy, the trio attempt to convince people that they exist.Once in a Moonlit Junkyard - Compo has a visit from a mysterious motorcyclist, who he thinks may be a former acquaintance.The Space Ace - The trio meet an amateur astronaut. They take him to the local pub, where he gets blind drunk. Whilst he sleeps it off, Foggy decides to organise a new training programme for him.The Most Powerful Eyeballs in West Yorkshire - Foggy is convinced he has a knack for hypnotherapy, but he goes under himself.The Dewhirsts of Ogleby Hall - Foggy becomes convinced he is a member of an old aristocratic family.The Sweet Smell of Excess - Compo uses his bed as a trampoline, but winds up caught in the bed spring. The trio manage to cut him free straight over a sewer, and then have to get rid of the resulting whiff, which prevents them from going anywhere public.That's it Summer Winers, enjoy.",5,The Devil's In The Details,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,2417,"['Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'course', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'give', 'try', ""'95"", 'release', 'particularly', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'Foggy', 'tip', 'top', 'form', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'older', 'Foggy', 'more', 'younger', 'Foggy', ""'70"", 'superb', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'OK', 'enough', 'review', 'here', 'what', 'want', 'Information.This', 'release', 'will', 'include', 'dizzyingly', 'comical', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'first', 'time', 'January', '1995', 'Special', 'Man', 'Who', 'Nearly', 'Knew', 'Pavarotti', 'been', 'released', 'commercially', 'U.S.', 'OK', 'here', 'rundown', 'Man', 'Who', 'Nearly', 'Knew', 'Pavrotti', 'January', '1995', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'episode', 'one', 'several', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Norman', 'Wisdom', 'bumbler', 'Billy', 'Ingleton', 'Billy', 'piano', 'always', 'been', 'dream', 'play', 'professionally', 'trio', 'piano', 'recital', 'when', 'spotlight', 'Billy', 'stage', 'fright', 'Luckily', 'Compo', 'idea', 'up', 'sleeve.The', 'Glory', 'Hole', 'Foggy', 'out', 'relive', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'seeing', 'holein', 'road', 'made', 'think', 'trenches', 'Adopted', 'Stray', 'trio', 'man', 'who', 'throwing', 'out', 'van', 'live', 'hermit', 'happily', 'van-', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'wife', 'come', 'Defeat', 'Stoneworm', 'Howard', 'secret', 'method', 'communication', 'Clegg-', 'tapping', 'walls', 'When', 'Pearl', 'almost', 'act', 'household', 'pest', 'called', 'stoneworm', 'sympathy', 'trio', 'attempt', 'convince', 'people', 'exist.Once', 'Moonlit', 'Junkyard', 'Compo', 'visit', 'mysterious', 'motorcyclist', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'former', 'acquaintance.The', 'Space', 'Ace', 'trio', 'meet', 'amateur', 'astronaut', 'take', 'local', 'pub', 'where', 'blind', 'drunk', 'off', 'Foggy', 'organise', 'new', 'training', 'programme', 'him.The', 'Most', 'Powerful', 'Eyeballs', 'West', 'Yorkshire', 'Foggy', 'convinced', 'knack', 'hypnotherapy', 'himself.The', 'Dewhirsts', 'Ogleby', 'Hall', 'Foggy', 'convinced', 'member', 'old', 'aristocratic', 'family.The', 'Sweet', 'Smell', 'Excess', 'Compo', 'bed', 'trampoline', 'up', 'caught', 'bed', 'spring', 'trio', 'manage', 'cut', 'free', 'straight', 'sewer', 'then', 'have', 'get', 'rid', 'resulting', 'whiff', 'going', 'anywhere', 'public.That', 'Summer', 'Winers', 'enjoy']",N/A
