The char. of Piggy is spot-on; Ralph is a bit stiff; Jack is way too young to be Jack; the constant f-this and f-that speeches; and the flight captain coming in on the beach with them from the start was a sure sign that the creator of the film was about to take artistic license - there were no bonus features, but I could imagine one of those smarmy voices: ""It was one of my fave childhood books - wanted to bring it to life on the screen - you know - really do it justice and all that.""

However, as soon as purchased it, and read the back I knew I was in for it. I decided to try it anyways.First off, why do the kids need to be Americanized? Also, why do they also have to be from a military school? And why does the director basically destroy every impressive portion of the book? Did the director even have a desire to put events in order?I'm assuming he made all the kids American because he thought this would relate better to middle-aged kids. I'm also not really sure what ALF has to do with the book, yet somehow the tv show about an alien finds its way into the script. To be even more impressive, glow sticks/ light sabers (and Rambo) found their way into this script, too.One could vaguely see the reasoning behind making the students from military school, but that has very little to do with the book again. Perhaps the director was trying to establish a chain of command before they are put on the island.So far, there's been next-to no mention of Samneric, no Percival Wemys Madison, no Beast from Water, no Beast from Air, and there's been an assassinated chameleon. I was excited to see how a movie would handle the scene with Simon and the Lord of the Flies but was let down immensely. The great conflict between Ralph and Jack is awful at best and the dichotomy of Jack and Piggy being the devil and angel, respectively, on Ralph's shoulders is not even touched upon. Actually, Jack's actor and his nominal acting ability is annoying. These characters just aren't believable. It's hard to take this movie seriously when Jack defects from Ralph's leadership within thirty minutes of the start. What could be a great study in book/ movie differences for a middle school or high school class is removed by the amount of cursing in this movie. I don't mind cursing every once in a while, but the cursing in this movie can't even come off well. Ralph doesn't even say, ""Sucks to your ass-mar.""I advise you to save your money with this movie. Read the book and see what decent writing is all about. Luckily I got this movie locally and didn't waste money on shipping. Needless to say I won't be showing this awful rendition to students. I feel they'll laugh at it more than I am and ultimately lose them for good on a great book.",1,An accordion washes onto the island?

145969,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792840941,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I, for one, didn't think this was a poorly conceived as so many others feel it was.  The film doesn't quite reach the greatness of the novel; but that is a big feat and one that I think is nearly impossible to achieve.  There are many reasons as to why that would be impossible, but most notably is the explicit nature and the youthful core of the story.A film about pre-teen boys committing savage and brutal acts is hard to depict authentically.For what it is attempting to create, Harry Hook's 1990 adaptation works rather well.  The savage quality of the film's visual appeal is splashed across every scene (the cinematography is amazing; lush and claustrophobic) and that goes a long way here.  The storyline is more `inspired by' and not necessarily strictly adapted from the source material.  I feel that this screenplay was a safer version, one that could flirt with the brutality of the novel without having to cross a dangerous line.  That said, I felt that some of the liberties were unnecessary and even distracting, while others worked fine.  I wasn't offended by the modernizing of the script (with glow-lights and the like) but as some have mentioned, the film comes off rather dated because of the random pop-culture reference (ALF!!!) and so it loses a little bit of the poignancy in the process.  It would have been better left along, because the original prose has that feeling of `timelessness') to it.The film's biggest problem is the change made to the `boys' being stranded on the island.  By depicting these boys as slightly older military students, they discredited Golding's initial vision and ultimate question as to the moral compass driving our youth (and the human species as a whole).  By taking away the innocence of the boys (obviously, military students would already be familiar with violence, leadership and power) this film almost becomes another `study' altogether.Another problem here is the acting.  One of the biggest reasons why this story is so hard to film is that it contains a large `young' cast and getting a group of young boys to `act' in a way that feels nature can be difficult.  The acting for the most part feels stiff and unauthentic.  Balthazar Getty (brilliant name) is very green here.  His performance feels forced.  Danuel Pipoly, who is singled out and praised by a lot of reviewers here, was actually worse in my eyes.  He really lathered it on in ways that felt uncomfortably bad.  Chris Furrh was actually quite good as the savage Jack.  He fell into that arrogant mold effortlessly.In all honesty, it was Badgett Dale's largely silent supporting role that had me the most entranced.It's beautiful to look at and in the end it contains some controversial imagery (Piggy's demise) that makes it a conversation piece, but it lacks the depth of relevance that the novel had.  In parts this can feel like a lazy attempt at visualizing the classic, but on the other hand it succeeds in areas that make it palatable.",3,Lord almighty...,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,2973,"['one', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'feel', 'was', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'greatness', 'novel', 'big', 'feat', 'one', 'think', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'achieve', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'most', 'notably', 'explicit', 'nature', 'youthful', 'core', 'story.A', 'film', 'pre-teen', 'boys', 'committing', 'savage', 'brutal', 'acts', 'hard', 'depict', 'authentically.For', 'what', 'attempting', 'create', 'Harry', 'Hook', '1990', 'adaptation', 'rather', 'well', 'savage', 'quality', 'film', 'visual', 'appeal', 'splashed', 'scene', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'lush', 'claustrophobic', 'long', 'way', 'here', 'storyline', 'more', 'inspired', 'not', 'necessarily', 'strictly', 'adapted', 'source', 'material', 'feel', 'screenplay', 'was', 'safer', 'version', 'one', 'could', 'flirt', 'brutality', 'novel', 'having', 'cross', 'dangerous', 'line', 'said', 'felt', 'liberties', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'even', 'distracting', 'others', 'worked', 'fine', 'was', ""n't"", 'offended', 'modernizing', 'script', 'glow-lights', 'like', 'have', 'mentioned', 'film', 'rather', 'dated', 'random', 'pop-culture', 'reference', 'ALF', 'little', 'bit', 'poignancy', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'left', 'along', 'original', 'prose', 'feeling', 'timelessness', 'it.The', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'change', 'made', 'boys', 'being', 'stranded', 'island', 'depicting', 'boys', 'slightly', 'older', 'military', 'students', 'discredited', 'Golding', 'initial', 'vision', 'ultimate', 'question', 'moral', 'compass', 'driving', 'youth', 'human', 'species', 'whole', 'taking', 'away', 'innocence', 'boys', 'obviously', 'military', 'students', 'would', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'violence', 'leadership', 'power', 'film', 'almost', 'study', 'altogether.Another', 'problem', 'here', 'acting', 'One', 'biggest', 'reasons', 'why', 'story', 'so', 'hard', 'film', 'large', 'young', 'cast', 'getting', 'group', 'young', 'boys', 'act', 'way', 'nature', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'feels', 'stiff', 'unauthentic', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'brilliant', 'name', 'very', 'green', 'here', 'performance', 'feels', 'forced', 'Danuel', 'Pipoly', 'who', 'singled', 'out', 'praised', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'here', 'was', 'actually', 'worse', 'eyes', 'really', 'lathered', 'ways', 'felt', 'uncomfortably', 'bad', 'Chris', 'Furrh', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'savage', 'Jack', 'fell', 'arrogant', 'mold', 'effortlessly.In', 'honesty', 'was', 'Badgett', 'Dale', 'largely', 'silent', 'supporting', 'role', 'had', 'most', 'entranced.It', 'beautiful', 'look', 'end', 'controversial', 'imagery', 'Piggy', 'demise', 'conversation', 'piece', 'depth', 'relevance', 'novel', 'had', 'parts', 'can', 'feel', 'lazy', 'attempt', 'visualizing', 'classic', 'other', 'hand', 'areas', 'make', 'palatable']",N/A

I was prompted to read the novel, and found the story good but ultimately frightening, especially Simon talking with ""the Lord of the Flies."" I thought it was very weird that this was not in the film since I saw it as the most important part of the story.Balthazar Getty is so-so (this was his first film, I think) in his performance as Ralph, but the other actors (mostly unknowns who never appeared in any other films, with good reason) fell way short. I was however, still affected by some scenes after viewing the film on Bravo a few weeks ago. It had been years since I'd seen it, and nice to view it with a different perspective. I advise ""baltysgirl"" below to do the same. I understand the enthusiasm for the film, but this whole story is based on something far more profound than a guy's ""pretty face."" If you defend its flaws and excessive foul language etc. with that much gusto and also claim to be ""balty's girl"", it leads others to suspect you've missed the point. Be honest with yourself. If Balty wasn't in it, would you adore it that much?The best actor in the film I think was Badge Dale as Simon, but I am partial to the Simon character so I could be biased. I thought Chris Furrh (who was, strangely enough in a TV movie made just after this one called ""Exile"" -- about a group of young people stranded on a deserted island who eventually become savages complete with warpaint and spears) overacted his way through LOTF and seemed more annoying than evil.Piggy (Daniel somebody) was annoying as well. I agree with the other reviewer who said Piggy was too blubbery and all. I just didn't really feel like the actor believed HE was on this island with this action happening. He didn't seem genuine enough in his performance.When movies are made from books we know they won't be perfectly accurate, but to take out or change the parts of the story that make it a good story is just ridiculous, and that is what happened here. We lost the entire social commentary, we lost the depth of thought, and we lost the chance to look closer and walk away with something substantial.All we got was a couple of hours of nice scenery, pleasant music, and a bit of action. I must add that the last sequence was very well played out and Getty finally pulled out the talent we should have seen throughout the film.",2,Ok for what it is.

Honestly, although there are significant differences, I like the film better than the book because it is not boring and it's more Americanized. The book is dated, and the language tunes me out. In the movie, I think the points are delivered well, just the same as the book, in a shorter amount of time. Of course, I find the ending quite comical. Wild kids running around in their underwear and the look at the Marine's face put the icing on the cake for me.

Even though there's one older man on the island, he's pretty much delirious and unable to pitch in and help, so he doesn't really play much of a part in the storyline.Everything seems fine at first- the boys get along and act like typical kids at that age, however pretty soon the two oldest boys get into a disagreement, and this translates into a fight over who's actually the leader of the group.  The storyline actually turns pretty tragic and unexpected later on when the boys realize perfectly well there's a strong possibility they'll never be rescued, so they basically turn into island warriors willing to do *anything* to survive.Overall I thought it was a very entertaining movie.  Because of some violent segments and a few nasty swear words being thrown around occasionally, it's hard for me to recommend children view this movie, but I suppose older kids around 12 or older would be a more suitable age group.I can't find any complaints.

Marold""","[2, 4]","`Lord of the Flies' has been made into a movie at least twice since the William Golding novel of the same name became a cult classic / must read volume for high school and college students in the late 1950s. The first version, which follows the novel very closely, was done in black and white by the noted director, Peter Brook in 1963. The second version was done in color by Harry Hook and released in 1990.Like many remakes in the same language, one immediately wonders why bother, as the original Brook version is more than gripping enough to convey the message of the novel.To highlight the differences between the two versions, let me outline the story shared by the two versions.The scene is set when an airplane carrying school children crashes in the South Pacific, of the coast of a remote tropical island. Approximately 30 of the children, ages 6 to 13 make it to shore and gather on the beach to work out how they are to survive and assume that since they are far removed from their original destination and the island is small and uninhabited, there is a good chance it will take a long time, if ever, for grown-ups to find and rescue them. The first two principle characters are Ralph, one of the two or three oldest boys who we meet first, in the company of an intelligent, bespectacled, slightly overweight boy of the same age known as `Piggy'. The third main character is Jack, about as old and as fit as Ralph. Three minor named characters are Simon, who is prone to fainting and `seeing things' and Sam and Eric, a pair of twins.An early vote sets up Ralph as the leader, with a few rules establishing a conch shell found by Ralph and Piggy in the first reel as the symbol of the right to speak to the gathering of boys. Jack immediately assumes the responsibility as leader of a `gang' (later to become a `tribe') of hunters who will also take responsibility for maintaining a signal fire which Ralph succeeds in lighting by using Piggy's eyeglass lens as a means of concentrating sunlight on a clump of tinder.Jack's gang gets involved too much in hunting and allows the signal fire to go out just as an aircraft flies near the island. Soon, a story evolves about the presence of a monster on the island. This creates the pretext for Jack to split off from the group with his tribe and create a camp at a more defensible location. As this larger group becomes more and more primitive, they raid Ralph's camp and steal Piggy's specs since it is the only means they have for starting fires. To placate the monster, the head of a killed wild pig is cut from its carcass and stood on the top of a pole near the suspected monster's lair as an offering to the monster.After a few days, Simon observes this pig's head and its very large collection of flies feasting on the festering flesh and imagines he hears the pigs head speak to him, hence, the source of the title. Simon is then killed when the hunters mistake him in the night for the monster.When Ralph and Piggy walk to Jack's camp to recover Piggy's specs, Piggy is killed by another `accident' when Jack's tribe members pry a large boulder loose that falls on Piggy. Ralph and Jack fight, Ralph is driven off, and the whole tribe sets fire to the jungle to flush out Ralph and, presumably, kill him. Both stories end as Ralph runs to the beach to find himself at the feet of a very professionally uniformed member of his country's elite armed services.Hook spices up the dialogue by making the boys much more hip with lots of swear words and references to contemporary popular shows such as Alf and Miss Piggy of the Muppets. Unfortunately, Hook looses the two most important elements of the whole story. In the beginning of the novel and, subtly, in the beginning of Brook's film, we see that the world is once more at war and the boys from several different schools are on a plane to Australia to find relative safety from the coming (nuclear?) conflict. Hook shows nothing of this, giving us simply a group of boys from the same military academy on a trip to goodness knows where. This totally looses the whole allegorical sense of the story where the conflict between the boys mirrors the war in the world at large, especially the sense of the last scene where the world (island) is destroyed by the conflict (fire).The second major oversight in Hook's rendition is that there is never enough attention given to the significance of the pig's head, Simon's vision, and the sense of `The Lord of the Flies'. A less important point is that the origin of the monster myth is different in the two movies. Brook's film follows the book and has it be a misinterpretation of a billowing parachute from a fallen, dead pilot. Hook creates the myth out of the spasms of the downed plane's delirious pilot as he finds refuge in a cave and is rediscovered by Simon who believes he is a monster.Both movies do a credible job of depicting the fall of nominally civilized boys into savagery and myth. The combat between Ralph and Jack near the end is straight out of Frazier's `The Golden Bough' on the myth of killing the king. Unfortunately, Hook's version seems as eviscerated as the pig carcass, as all the great allegorical of the original story are totally lost. And, as minimal as they were, I even think the boys' performances in Brook's version are better done, as their initial innocence in the face of this loss of civilization makes their transformation all the more interesting.Brook's version is highly recommended.",3,This version simply misses the point.

Even still, I am usually scrambling to find homes for the sizeable handful that do not return their permission slips.This is the ONLY rated-R movie I would ever attempt to show my students.  It is rated R for cussing, the scenes in which Simon and Piggy leave the story (subtle gore), and a scene in which the boys remove the head from a pig carcass.  The cussing is not excessive, though, and does not detract from the story.Students may need explanation on a couple of points.  First, who are these kids in the movie?  If there is a JROTC at your local high school, most students will understand if you compare the boys' somewhat military background to that.  One of my JROTC cadets was even able to tell me the ranks of all the boys, and what all their uniform cords meant!  Second, there is a reference to ""Alf"" when the kids are wondering what is on TV.  It's too bad they couldn't have made it The Simpsons or The Addams Family or Batman or Transformers or something that everyone would still know.  ""Alf"" was a puppet character from outer space living with an American family, or at least I think--I never watched the show.All in all, this one is worth showing if you can get permission.",4,A jungle in color!

145980,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,0792840941,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[6, 7]","At its outset the update film version of Golding's classic novel is creepy and cinematically mysterious. We see the commotion as the boys try to make it to the island while many of the adults are apparently dead or clinging to life, all trying to swim towards shore after the plane went down. In this version, the boys who make it to the island are from an American military cadet school instead of being English. The early stages of the film really do keep the impact of the story alive, but as the film wanes, so does the mystique of the tale.It's really hard to know who to blame, the child actors who played these characters ineffectively, or the screenwriters, for putting in a slew of profanity and inane parts to the movie. The children who played these characters for the most part did what they could with this script. For what it is worth, I really liked how Simon was personified in several of the scenes, especially the one with the ""monster"" (the ""beast"" in the other movie version). You really get a sense that he is like the character in the book, as he connects with nature and seems to not fear what the others do: the mysterious ""creature"" in the cave. Ralph's character was depicted in an appropriate way also for the most part. However, Jack's character was just way too one-demensional: he seemingly never had a chance to grow into the antagonist because he was already one when the movie started. It probably didn't help that Jack's character had profanity-laced tirades aimed at Ralph and Piggy for a good deal of the film, and these moments seemingly killed any originality that the movie could have had. Lines from some of Jack's ""servants"" were kind of asinine also: ""The Chief has spoken.""Perhaps this film could have also done a better job of building the momentum of the story. It seemed like events were happening too quick. One minute they don't know how to hunt; the next they are experts. They could have also built up the character conflicts between Jack/ Roger and Ralph/Piggy a little better. They are seemingly friends one minute and enemies the next.If you completely forget that this is Lord of the Flies, or even related to it, and take this movie as just a modern survival story you will be better served. For what it is worth, I am not a big fan of the other version of Lord of the Flies either, although it is better than this one.

Sandra Bullock as Julia?The only really good thing about the film is the photography. The kids looked like savages behind the face paint, but the American accents were a distraction.

The Peter Brook version was much better in that respect.If  &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; had to be remade, it should have been more faithful to the book by putting stronger emphasis on those things that made the book so disturbing: without the restraints of civilization, Man reverts to cruelty and barbarism.

145990,A3VV4GUGLUVUP1,0792840941,Joel R. Bryan,"[2, 4]","This is less a review than it is a warning.  This &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a shabby version of the classic novel, shorn of all the original's power.  The filmmakers made a crucial error in transforming the cast from English private schoolboys to American military schoolers- this enables the audience to comfortably distance themselves from the events by putting the onus of evil militarism on the boys.  William Golding's novel was more about the universality of our evil impulses; therefore its message went much deeper.But this is typical of lazy Hollywood productions.  Only the simplest ideas remain and only shallow beliefs can be tolerated.  So here we have a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as an indictment of militarism, rather than a harsh look at how easily even the most civilized among us can be reduced by our basic primativistic impulses to savagery.  This is part of the human condition, an unfortunate one.Also missing is the novel's sequence where Christ-symbol Simon has his hallucinagenic conversation with the rotten pig's head and his subsequent epiphany.  I suppose the filmmakers were too afraid of the metaphysical aspects of the story.  So why bother to make it at all?  It frightens me to think some well-meaning English lit teacher might be showing this to a class in some high school somewhere.The acting here is subpar, and its central failure to think things through or take the novel's hard lessons to heart results in a tacky, weak-kneed movie.  Not worth the time.  But if you must see a movie version of this book- check out the 1963 version.

At first, I liked this movie, but by the time I reached my teens, I ended up watching it less and less, until I got to where I HATED it. This film deals with a group of young adolescent boys on their way home from a military academy when their plane crashes in the ocean, and they make their way (by a large inflatable raft) to an island that nobody lives on.The pilot ends up dying, and they end up surviving on whatever food they can find, and after a while, a majority of the boys end up creating war paint (from a pig's blood, etc.) and, a small number of boys (three of them) end up in the ""good group"" (not having war paint, no bad behavior, etc.).As you get further into the film, there ends up being nothing but a lot of bickering and negativity amongst the boys. Also, you could kind of think of this film as an all-boys' version of ""Survivor"", and  ""Gilligan's Island"" (remember, this movie was from 1990, roughly a decade before reality shows came along, and many years after ""Gilligan's Island"" went off the air).

I find the director strayed way to far from what the movie should be and turned it into more of a Peter Pan and the lost boys, minus Wendy, though I guess you could say Ralph makes a good Wendy.  I read another reveiw about the sunrise and sunset scene in the movie, at the same tree, on the same cliff.  It could have been much better if I could give it no stars I would.  I doubt a group of boys getting stranded on and island would be swimming within the first couple days, as to the trauma of their plight.  I also don't think it covers any form of reality book or movie wise.  But it's mostly just a fun movie to watch.  I also see a lot of things like survival taking a back seat to the reality of what real survival is considering I am a trained survivalist by the S.A.S. as well as S.F.  If you are looking for the real lord of the flies get the 1963 version it's closer to the book,  but read the book since neither movie captures the book's spirit.

Although I haven't seen the 1960's one, it probably would have been a better choice. Granted, the movie is gorgeously filmed. The island the boys inhabit is rich in color and vegetation. But of course, looks alone do not make a film. It must have some substance. Perhaps having read the book and rather enjoying it, I have a biased opinion but this film didn't seem to have much to do with the book except share a title, main idea and some character names. Sara Schiff should be ashamed for butchering the tale. Trying to modernize the story may have seemed like a good idea, but it wasn't, it really wasn't. Since the boys are no longer British and no longer living during the WWII era (one mentions 'Alf', seriously folks) and since they are American children who have grown up on video games and now curse like sailors, it is easier to believe that they would revert to savagery. The screenplay has also conviently added an adult on the island and also completely removed the entire scene with Simon and the Lord of the Flies. The young actors cannot be accused of bad acting since almost none of the characters are developed enough to really act. Ralph was watered down, Piggy reminded me of a young Drew Carey. The only characters I had strong feelings for were Jack (hated him) and Simon (loved him). It's just kind of a shame.

It is, at times, lush, humid and tropically, oppressively beautiful.  All of which are good things......but that's all I can say good about the film.Golding originally conceived &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as an xploration of Human nature, and how people are inheirently evil.  To drive this point home, he took English school boys (some of whom were members of a church choir) crash landed them on an island during a wartime evacuation and said, &quot;Have at it!&quot; (metaphorically speaking).  The book and indeed the 1963 movie version asks how if even children can become cruel and violent and evil with very little prompting, are humans as advanced as we like to think?  Are we really all that different from animals?  Readers/viewers are shocked to see how far such a small child can fall.Weeeeeeeeellllllll...This, the 1990 version of Lord of the Flies, puts American military students on an island during a conflict of some sort, so when the first blow is struck it's not all that surprising. This removes the impact of Golding's ideas, and this becomes another adventure story (of sorts.  Like &quot;The Hun Family Robinson&quot;).  Further, the &quot;updated&quot; material doesn't really work: the glo-sticks, kids talking about watching &quot;ALF&quot; on TV (which seriously dates this movie.  I guess the screenwrighter thought ALF would be around forever.  Another example of the narrowness of this version.  It is already obsolete, while the book perseveres.), Simon having a vision of a stealth bomber, etc..  It's all a bit too uneven, too naive almost, but totally lacking in charm (if such a word can be used here).  In essence, this is a visceral film that lacks guts.Nothing upsets me more than movies that violate the basic premise of a book (&quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; also comes screaming to mind), and this movie goes out of its way to be &quot;different&quot; but identifibe by its title.  Really, this should have been called something else for as much as the story is like the book; perhaps  &quot;Ishtar&quot; would be more appropriate.One weird editing glitch I noticed was an image of a sunrise - the viewer sees it from a cliff with a tree interveing the space.  Well, that night at sunset we see the same tree, the same cliff, but reversed!!  Like the sun rose and set in the same place in the sky and the tree had turned to meet it.  It's very disconcerting.So, unless you're taking a class in comparative cinema, don't bother with this one.  An, whatever happened to Balthazar Getty?

But let's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one I am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen. Even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that. You can interpret the meaning of `Lord of the Flies' but who can really visualize it, or the imaginary conversations of Simon for that matter?The biggest problem of Harry Hook's new version is not the changes done to the film. The boys are American military school cadets, using dirty words frequently, but those parts didn't annoy me much. Real problem is something more essential to the film, which is storytelling. In short the 1990 film doesn't know what it wants to be. On the film's video cover you can read (and I quote) `this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul."" Well, not exactly.For as adventure story it lacks pace; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing. As allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character. The conflict between Ralph and Jack should be clearer, and Piggy's role should be more than that of a whining fat boy. And don't forget Simon, who sees things, it is true, but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us.It is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful.

If I ever have the opportunity to make big-budget pictures myself, LORD OF THE FLIES would be one I would make. Therefore, I don't really have a problem with this ""Americanized"" version of Golding's classic tale of good versus evil. I also found it interesting how the movie illustrates the friendship that existed between all the boys before the split in their society began. The acting is well done. The movie also has a good soundtrack and some excellent cinematography.Unfortunately, the whole spirit of the novel doesn't exist in the film and that is a severe detriment. The breakup of society is not really examined and the boys who end up following the Lord of the Flies seem more like rowdy schoolchildren rather than youth who have given themselves over to pure evil. I was also disappointed that Simon was reduced to such a small role and that his famous scene talking with the real Lord of the Flies didn't even take place (yes, it would be expensive to do, but that scene is crucial to the rest of the story's plot).Overall, a decent movie, but not a very good adaptation of the novel it's based upon.",3,The Spirit Is Lost.,1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,1274,"['have', 'admit', 'LORD', 'THE', 'FLIES', 'one', 'favorite', 'novels', 'just', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'THE', 'CHRONICLES', 'OF', 'NARNIA', 'favorite', 'novels', 'ever', 'have', 'opportunity', 'make', 'big-budget', 'pictures', 'LORD', 'THE', 'FLIES', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'make', 'Therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'problem', 'Americanized', 'version', 'Golding', 'classic', 'tale', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'also', 'found', 'interesting', 'how', 'movie', 'friendship', 'existed', 'boys', 'split', 'society', 'began', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'also', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'cinematography.Unfortunately', 'whole', 'spirit', 'novel', ""n't"", 'exist', 'film', 'severe', 'detriment', 'breakup', 'society', 'not', 'really', 'examined', 'boys', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'following', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'seem', 'more', 'rowdy', 'schoolchildren', 'rather', 'youth', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'pure', 'evil', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'Simon', 'was', 'reduced', 'such', 'small', 'role', 'famous', 'scene', 'talking', 'real', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'place', 'yes', 'would', 'be', 'expensive', 'do', 'scene', 'crucial', 'rest', 'story', 'plot', '.Overall', 'decent', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'based']",N/A
