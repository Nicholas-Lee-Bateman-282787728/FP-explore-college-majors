I can't imagine anyone talking to their young kids about hoping from one affair to another, strip clubs and other immature shenanigans.The series is about a group of immature friends in their 30's, whose main pursuits in life are hanging in a bar drinking, playing pranks on each other and looking for someone to ""bang"". This word ""banging"" is the most used word in their dialog, especially the self-indulgent, narcissist womanizing Barney.OK, it is occasionally entertaining and not the worst comedy on TV, but overall fairly dumb with quite unlikable characters.",2,Immature Shenanigans and sexcapades,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,795,"['First', 'off', 'premise', 'show', 'ridiculous', 'father', 'telling', 'young', 'teenage', 'kids', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'years', 'ago', 'story', 'date', 'sexcapade', 'friends', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'many', 'lame', 'details', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'talking', 'young', 'kids', 'hoping', 'one', 'affair', 'strip', 'clubs', 'other', 'immature', 'shenanigans.The', 'series', 'group', 'immature', 'friends', '30', 'main', 'pursuits', 'life', 'are', 'hanging', 'bar', 'drinking', 'playing', 'pranks', 'other', 'looking', 'someone', 'bang', 'word', 'banging', 'most', 'used', 'word', 'dialog', 'especially', 'self-indulgent', 'narcissist', 'womanizing', 'Barney.OK', 'occasionally', 'entertaining', 'not', 'worst', 'comedy', 'TV', 'overall', 'fairly', 'dumb', 'quite', 'unlikable', 'characters']",How I Met Your Mother: Seasons 1-5
1384857,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B004477V7K,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[11, 11]","Hollywood likes to repeat itself. Well, I should say that if an idea is successful they try to repeat the success. In movies they create sequels, prequels, and remakes. In TV they make spinoffs or remakes. Sometimes they work like Frasier, other times they don't work at all like the American made version of Britain's Coupling (which was itself a British working of Friends). After Seinfeld studio after studio bought ideas of endearingly funny people who were basically loathsome people, and after Friends studios bought ideas of groups of best friends who met in public places to talk about their messed up sex lives.Boiled down to its basic premise, How I Met Your Mother could be considered to fall into the latter category. Because I was never a fan of Friends (still not, although I have enjoyed a couple of episodes here and there, I wouldn't turn on the show of my own accord) and many critics and commentators compared How I Met Your Mother to Friends I decided not to check it out at first. There have been many Friends clones, and I felt that another one of them didn't warrant my attention. It wasn't until just before the fourth season aired that I realized I was wrong to wait so long to check it out.I would be lying if I said that the recent appeal of Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Segel's recent box office success in Forgetting Sarah Marshall had nothing to do with my choice to check out the show. It was really my fianc&eacute;e who got me to check it out. While I was at work a few times Renee chose to check out some episodes in syndication on Lifetime and really enjoyed them and got me to check it out. The first episode I viewed was the season 3 episode ""How I Met Everyone Else"". In the episode Ted (Josh Radnor) brings a new girl he's dating to meet the group, and everyone in his group of friends recounts how they met each other.This particular episode illustrated one of the brilliant elements of How I Met Your Mother's storytelling. While the initial conceit has Ted in the future (future Ted is voiced by Bob Saget) telling his kids the story of how he met their mother. At times this allows for a modicum of suspension of belief because of the fact that future Ted is perfectly capable (and at times his kids call him out on it) of embellishing the story. Beyond that we see stories within stories. ""How I Met Everyone Else"" exploits this idea to great effect. For three seasons we've seen these characters together only really knowing how Robin came to join the circle of friends, but here we get the full story and told in a way that remains engaging.All of the characters are fully rounded with quirks that endear them to the audience rather than overbearing. The cast and crew have proven that How I Met Your Mother is first and foremost a character driven show, and even in the show's sixth season they pull major surprises. Throughout ""Bad News"" we watch a hidden countdown ticking down to the biggest tragedy in the history of the show. Over the next several episodes we watch as the gang works together to help each other through the situation. There are also running gags throughout the series, but these work to further flesh out the characters and their relationships and are not overused. In the season 2 episode ""Slap Bet"" Barney and Marshall enter into a bet that leads to Marshall being able to slap Barney 5 times at any time he wishes. Going into the seventh season only four of the slaps have been dealt, and they're typically dealt without the prior knowledge of the audience. There's also a really brilliant recurring gag about Robin (Cobie Smulders) being a former Canadian pop star that hits all the right notes (pun intended) as well.Because it is one of the best American sitcoms in recent years, How I Met Your Mother ranks on my list of top 10 favorite TV shows. It would rank higher, but I have to admit that the show suffers from a somewhat dull main character. While Ted is not the worst in this category, I have to admit that I would rather watch any of the other characters on the show more. Also the fifth season didn't live up to the promise of the previous four. However I do also have to give this show extra credit for making even Britney Spears tolerable!5/5Be sure to check out:Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!",5,How I Met Your Mother,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,4302,"['Hollywood', 'likes', 'repeat', 'Well', 'should', 'say', 'idea', 'successful', 'try', 'repeat', 'success', 'movies', 'create', 'sequels', 'prequels', 'remakes', 'TV', 'make', 'spinoffs', 'remakes', 'Sometimes', 'work', 'Frasier', 'other', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'American', 'made', 'version', 'Britain', 'Coupling', 'was', 'British', 'working', 'Friends', 'Seinfeld', 'studio', 'studio', 'bought', 'ideas', 'endearingly', 'funny', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'basically', 'loathsome', 'people', 'Friends', 'studios', 'bought', 'ideas', 'groups', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'met', 'public', 'places', 'talk', 'messed', 'up', 'sex', 'lives.Boiled', 'down', 'basic', 'premise', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'fall', 'latter', 'category', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'Friends', 'still', 'not', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'couple', 'episodes', 'here', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', 'show', 'own', 'accord', 'many', 'critics', 'commentators', 'compared', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'Friends', 'decided', 'not', 'check', 'out', 'first', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'Friends', 'clones', 'felt', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'warrant', 'attention', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'fourth', 'season', 'aired', 'realized', 'was', 'wrong', 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'check', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'recent', 'appeal', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'recent', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'choice', 'check', 'out', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'who', 'got', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'work', 'few', 'times', 'Renee', 'chose', 'check', 'out', 'episodes', 'syndication', 'Lifetime', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'got', 'check', 'out', 'first', 'episode', 'viewed', 'was', 'season', '3', 'episode', 'How', 'Met', 'Everyone', 'Else', 'episode', 'Ted', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'new', 'girl', 'dating', 'meet', 'group', 'everyone', 'group', 'friends', 'recounts', 'how', 'met', 'other.This', 'particular', 'episode', 'illustrated', 'one', 'brilliant', 'elements', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'storytelling', 'initial', 'conceit', 'Ted', 'future', 'future', 'Ted', 'voiced', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'telling', 'kids', 'story', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'times', 'modicum', 'suspension', 'belief', 'fact', 'future', 'Ted', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'times', 'kids', 'call', 'out', 'embellishing', 'story', 'see', 'stories', 'stories', 'How', 'Met', 'Everyone', 'Else', 'idea', 'great', 'effect', 'three', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'characters', 'together', 'only', 'really', 'knowing', 'how', 'Robin', 'came', 'join', 'circle', 'friends', 'here', 'get', 'full', 'story', 'told', 'way', 'engaging.All', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'rounded', 'quirks', 'endear', 'audience', 'rather', 'overbearing', 'cast', 'crew', 'have', 'proven', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'first', 'foremost', 'character', 'driven', 'show', 'even', 'show', 'sixth', 'season', 'pull', 'major', 'surprises', 'Bad', 'News', 'watch', 'hidden', 'countdown', 'ticking', 'down', 'biggest', 'tragedy', 'history', 'show', 'next', 'several', 'episodes', 'watch', 'gang', 'together', 'help', 'other', 'situation', 'are', 'also', 'running', 'gags', 'series', 'work', 'further', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'relationships', 'are', 'not', 'overused', 'season', '2', 'episode', 'Slap', 'Bet', 'Barney', 'Marshall', 'enter', 'bet', 'Marshall', 'being', 'able', 'slap', 'Barney', '5', 'times', 'time', 'Going', 'seventh', 'season', 'only', 'four', 'slaps', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', ""'re"", 'typically', 'dealt', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'audience', 'also', 'really', 'brilliant', 'recurring', 'gag', 'Robin', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'being', 'former', 'Canadian', 'pop', 'star', 'right', 'notes', 'pun', 'intended', 'well.Because', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'sitcoms', 'recent', 'years', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'list', 'top', '10', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'would', 'rank', 'higher', 'have', 'admit', 'show', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'main', 'character', 'Ted', 'not', 'worst', 'category', 'have', 'admit', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'more', 'Also', 'fifth', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'promise', 'previous', 'four', 'However', 'do', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'show', 'extra', 'credit', 'making', 'even', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'tolerable', '5/5Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Armadillo', 'Sands', 'Intellectual', 'Properties', 'Work']",How I Met Your Mother: Seasons 1-5
1384858,AQCD1307TM93R,B004477V7K,katarinaism,"[0, 0]","I'm not a huge television fan, but HIMYM is one of the few shows that I watch almost religiously, whether I watch online or when the episode runs on cable.  When I purchased this set, it was cheaper than if I had bought the five seasons individually (not sure if that is the case now).This show is incredibly entertaining, but I really didn't appreciate how intricate the writing is until seeing it unfold chronologically.  This is one show where watching it from the beginning really adds to the entertainment value.  Many other shows are pretty much the same week to week, so watching episodes out of sequence is fine and doesn't really make me want to purchase the season.  HIMYM is different from most sitcoms in that every episode builds upon the last, and to get all the inside jokes and references you have to see it from the beginning.The complexities of all the different storylines and how one storyline from a prior season comes up two seasons later to be revisited is awesome, and makes the viewer feel like they're in on the joke (ie Slapsgiving, Robin Sparkles, Doctor X).  Also, watching the characters develop over several seasons is a real treat and puts most other television shows to shame. The backdrop of NYC serves as an additional treat; I've been to NYC several times and it's always fun to see places I've visited pop up in different episodes.  I enjoy hearing the main character's (Ted's) narrative and point of view.It also is still running strong in the eighth season when many other shows I used to like that have made it that far (eg The Office) have grown kind of stale.
