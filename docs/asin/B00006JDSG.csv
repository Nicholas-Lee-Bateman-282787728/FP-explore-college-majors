Newman,"[18, 19]","This amazing and true tale follows the Civil War life of General Bartlett who survived multiple skirmishes, battles and hardships throughout his military career.  This story starts with Bartlett barely surviving a dangerous skirmish and retreat during the battle of Ball's Bluff when he was a Captain of Company I, 20th Massachusetts. Bartlett is soon promoted a number of times while losing a leg and suffering from a multiple of wounds.  Contrary to family pleas not to go back to the field, Bartlett faces the enemy on countless occasions and is eventually promoted to Brigadier General at the age of 24.The action never stops and the re-enactments are great.  Michael Kraus,David Neville and company have put together their finest work in this production that captures the heart, bravery and boldness of a great Union officer.  A nice thing to add is that this production is created by historians who care about proper clothing and following the absolute correct formats of those they are portraying.  Excellent re-enactments and fighting await you in this 80 minute story about a man that defied many odds during the Civil War.",5,"Courage, bravery and an iron will!",1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1132,"['amazing', 'true', 'tale', 'Civil', 'War', 'life', 'General', 'Bartlett', 'who', 'survived', 'multiple', 'skirmishes', 'battles', 'hardships', 'military', 'career', 'story', 'Bartlett', 'barely', 'surviving', 'dangerous', 'skirmish', 'retreat', 'battle', 'Ball', 'Bluff', 'when', 'was', 'Captain', 'Company', '20th', 'Massachusetts', 'Bartlett', 'soon', 'promoted', 'number', 'times', 'losing', 'leg', 'suffering', 'multiple', 'wounds', 'Contrary', 'family', 'pleas', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'field', 'Bartlett', 'enemy', 'countless', 'occasions', 'eventually', 'promoted', 'Brigadier', 'General', 'age', '24.The', 'action', 'never', 're-enactments', 'are', 'great', 'Michael', 'Kraus', 'David', 'Neville', 'company', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'finest', 'work', 'production', 'heart', 'bravery', 'boldness', 'great', 'Union', 'officer', 'nice', 'thing', 'add', 'production', 'created', 'historians', 'who', 'care', 'proper', 'clothing', 'following', 'absolute', 'correct', 'formats', 'are', 'portraying', 'Excellent', 're-enactments', 'fighting', 'await', '80', 'minute', 'story', 'man', 'defied', 'many', 'odds', 'Civil', 'War']",N/A
