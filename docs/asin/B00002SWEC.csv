It's written: ""And heaven and nature sing"" and they have changed it to: ""And saints and nature sing"". The production values are acceptable. And the Vienna Choir Boys portion is pleasant, but presented in the form of a ""story"" which I found silly and unnecessary. Just to hear them sing the carols is enough. The production values are fine.Overall: three stars. It could have been a lot better.",3,Good but not great.,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,525,"['find', 'M.T', 'Choir', 'better', 'Christmas', 'music', 'cds', 'do', 'DVD', 'why', 'WILL', 'change', 'words', 'written', 'heaven', 'nature', 'sing', 'have', 'changed', 'saints', 'nature', 'sing', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'acceptable', 'Vienna', 'Choir', 'Boys', 'portion', 'pleasant', 'presented', 'form', 'story', 'found', 'silly', 'unnecessary', 'Just', 'hear', 'sing', 'carols', 'enough', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'fine.Overall', 'three', 'stars', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better']",Hallelujah!

515421,A3F5TN3LOC8MCL,B00002SWEC,Gene Bitner,"[60, 63]","I have NO idea how this DVD can be sold for such a low price, unless it is being underwritten by the LDS Church!  The first half is typical tabernacle choir-- always good.  The second half is actually the &quot;Christmas With  the Vienna Boys Choir&quot; video which is available by itself on VHS for  more than this DVD costs. This fact is NOT given on-line, leading one to  think the DVD contains some sort of combined performance of the two groups.  The Vienna portion is an excellent production-- showing the boys not only  in their usual sailor suits, but also in their everyday clothes as they go  about enjoying the Christmas traditions of Austria.  Most of the singing is  lip-sync (to their own recorded voices), but that does not detract from the  very colorful and inspiring production.  You will feel better about the  future of humanity after watching and listening to these boys!",4,"Great DVD, but a little misleading...",951868800,"03 1, 2000",2000,893,"['have', 'idea', 'how', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'sold', 'such', 'low', 'price', 'being', 'underwritten', 'LDS', 'Church', 'first', 'half', 'typical', 'tabernacle', 'choir', 'always', 'good', 'second', 'half', 'actually', 'quot', 'Christmas', 'Vienna', 'Boys', 'Choir', 'quot', 'video', 'available', 'VHS', 'more', 'DVD', 'fact', 'NOT', 'given', 'on-line', 'leading', 'one', 'think', 'DVD', 'sort', 'combined', 'performance', 'two', 'groups', 'Vienna', 'portion', 'excellent', 'production', 'showing', 'boys', 'not', 'only', 'usual', 'sailor', 'suits', 'also', 'everyday', 'clothes', 'go', 'enjoying', 'Christmas', 'traditions', 'Austria', 'Most', 'singing', 'lip-sync', 'own', 'recorded', 'voices', 'not', 'detract', 'very', 'colorful', 'inspiring', 'production', 'will', 'feel', 'better', 'future', 'humanity', 'watching', 'listening', 'boys']",Hallelujah!
