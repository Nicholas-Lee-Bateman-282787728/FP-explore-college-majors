The quality wasn't as high as the previous American Tail movies. The animation was, well, bad. Fortunately  the few songs were good (especially &quot;Anywhere in our  Dreams&quot;).  The story was also OK. It deals a little with racism (the Americans don't  like the other mice because they are Natives) and how the Europeans took  over the Natives' land. This is perhaps something that children should  watch. They'd enjoy it for sure. Like I said. It's good on it's own, but  only on it's own. Worth the money anyways....",3,Erm.....good but not great,953251200,"03 17, 2000",2000,628,"['own', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'third', 'part', 'excellant', 'series', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'high', 'previous', 'American', 'Tail', 'movies', 'animation', 'was', 'well', 'bad', 'Fortunately', 'few', 'songs', 'were', 'good', 'especially', 'quot', 'Anywhere', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'OK', 'little', 'racism', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'mice', 'are', 'Natives', 'how', 'Europeans', 'took', 'over', 'Natives', 'land', 'perhaps', 'something', 'children', 'should', 'watch', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'sure', 'said', 'good', 'own', 'only', 'own', 'money', 'anyways']",An American Tail: The Treasure of Manhattan Island VHS

60917,A12XRHXJRFNKPT,0783228252,"M. M. Davis ""Matt Davis""","[8, 18]","For various reasons, I refuse to watch Disney cartoons, and until my two-year-old figures out how to get somebody to rent them for her, she won't see any either.  The *American Tail* series is one of the few great options left.This installment is neither as well drawn nor as musically satisfying as its predecessors, but it may well be my favorite cartoon movie now.Of course, that's because I *like* the &quot;political correctness&quot; that one reviewer derided.  I think that immigrant laborers and Native Americans, struggling for their place in an unforgiving City, make far better heroes than princesses and princes waiting for their divine rights to be recognized.If workers'/aboriginal rights seem like kind of a drag to you, then you may want to head over to the *Lion King*; I'm sure Disney will be happy to take your money.  If you'd prefer that your kids grow up with the (true) idea that America's story is more complicated than it first appears, this movie will be a great start.And it's not like your kids will be bored with it.  Since the DVD arrived three days ago, my daughter has frequently arisen from her nap already asking for 'mouse.'  She likes Fievel and Papa just plenty, and I like the fact that she still has no idea who Mickey is.",4,"A cut below the others, but still great",1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,1261,"['various', 'reasons', 'refuse', 'watch', 'Disney', 'cartoons', 'two-year-old', 'figures', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'somebody', 'rent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', '*American', 'Tail*', 'series', 'one', 'few', 'great', 'options', 'left.This', 'installment', 'as', 'well', 'drawn', 'musically', 'satisfying', 'predecessors', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'now.Of', 'course', '*like*', 'quot', 'political', 'correctness', 'quot', 'one', 'reviewer', 'derided', 'think', 'immigrant', 'laborers', 'Native', 'Americans', 'struggling', 'place', 'unforgiving', 'City', 'make', 'far', 'better', 'heroes', 'princesses', 'princes', 'waiting', 'divine', 'rights', 'be', 'recognized.If', ""workers'/aboriginal"", 'rights', 'seem', 'kind', 'drag', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'head', '*Lion', 'King*', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Disney', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'take', 'money', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'true', 'idea', 'America', 'story', 'more', 'complicated', 'first', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'start.And', 'not', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'three', 'days', 'ago', 'daughter', 'frequently', 'arisen', 'nap', 'already', 'asking', ""'mouse"", 'Fievel', 'Papa', 'just', 'plenty', 'like', 'fact', 'still', 'idea', 'who', 'Mickey']",An American Tail: The Treasure of Manhattan Island VHS
