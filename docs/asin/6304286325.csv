(When it pops up on cable from time to time, I find it curiously watchable, because it has the innocuous blandness and careful inoffensiveness of a good TV show, and sometimes I'm just in the mood for that.

Then there is Doug; growing up in a family of Hockey players and having to feel as if he let them down when he could no longer play professionally.Both characters learned to believe in themselves and along the way believe in one another, and end the end falling in love, all thanks to one little thing known as a toepick.:)",5,I know a classic when I see it,980985600,"02 1, 2001",2001,1208,"['can', 'love', 'movie', 'fifteen', 'continue', 'love', 'twenty-five', 'then', 'classic', 'Apparently', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'considering', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'finally', 'realeased', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'much', 'demand', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'FINALLY', 'available', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'romance', 'movies', 'forever', 'epsecially', 'films', 'two', 'characters', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'find', 'other', 'fall', 'love', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'made', 'roles', 'stubborn', 'primadonna', 'just', 'stubborn', 'former', 'hockey', 'player', 'so', 'believable', 'when', 'finally', 'do', 'get', 'together', 'can', 'do', 'cheer', 'on.I', 'liked', 'how', 'film', 'showed', 'characters', 'were', 'pushed', 'dreams', 'Kate', 'always', 'feeling', 'skating', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'father', 'love', 'winning', 'gold', 'medal', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'answer', 'mothers', 'dying', 'wishes', 'Then', 'Doug', 'growing', 'up', 'family', 'Hockey', 'players', 'having', 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'when', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'play', 'professionally.Both', 'characters', 'learned', 'believe', 'way', 'believe', 'one', 'end', 'end', 'falling', 'love', 'thanks', 'one', 'little', 'thing', 'known', 'toepick']",The Cutting Edge VHS

I didn't know, and was also thrilled to see -- for those of you who (also) didn't know it already -- that the FULL SCORE was FINALLY released on the Deluxe Edition CD Soundtrack Release and I picked-up both today!As for this Gold Metal Edition -- and for all you similarly panicked collectors -- PLEASE DO NOT PANIC!  Amazon made a MISTAKE in the listing, The Gold Metal Edition presents the film in its WIDESCREEN FORMAT and not the erroneously reported Full Screen Format.The DVD includes the original trailer, the trailer for the sequel, and a brief 10 minute retrospective featuring Moira and D.B. but (regrettably) does not include Roy or Terry.  A more comprehensive Cast/Director featurette/commentary would have been good to have -- there's no commentary at all -- but I'm very grateful that we got a decent Special Edition as well as the Deluxe Release of the Soundtrack with the Full Score.  Still, it's better that we got what we did 15 years late rather than never having gotten it at all!This movie holds up amazingly well because of the acting, music, and skating sequences and it's a fairly realistic portrayal of relational dynamics and the triumph of hope over despair, triumph over tragedy, and love over hate.  Considering how bad Ice Castles sucked I never thought I could love a skating movie until I saw this one.  Interestingly, Moira mentions that she gets moved at the same point I always do which is the big ""Kate, I need you... I NEED YOU!"" scene.As to the sequel, solid casting of Scott Thompson Baker and Stefanie Kramer as a 20 years later version of Kate & Doug bodes quite well for it since any sequel had the potential to be a complete and total disaster.  Kramer and Baker are hardly an impossible-to-believe-it set of casting choices for an older Kate & Doug.  However, one does have to wonder why they didn't/couldn't just bring back D.B. and Moira since it is the movie that basically made them!  Interestingly, in the retrospective, D.B. looks EXACTLY the same and Moira looks like she's aged a bit.It's a fairly inexpensive purchase to get this new Gold Metal Edition and it's so worth it when you think of how much the film has meant to all of us and to a new generation.",5,The BEST Skating Movie EVER!,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,2424,"['have', 'loved', 'movie', 'first', 'saw', 'theater', 'multiple', 'times', 'was', 'so', 'damn', 'good', 'was', 'thrilled', 'belief', 'read', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'new', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'today', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'also', 'thrilled', 'see', 'who', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'already', 'FULL', 'SCORE', 'was', 'FINALLY', 'released', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'CD', 'Soundtrack', 'Release', 'picked-up', 'today', 'Gold', 'Metal', 'Edition', 'similarly', 'panicked', 'collectors', 'PLEASE', 'DO', 'NOT', 'PANIC', 'Amazon', 'made', 'MISTAKE', 'listing', 'Gold', 'Metal', 'Edition', 'film', 'WIDESCREEN', 'FORMAT', 'not', 'erroneously', 'reported', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Format.The', 'DVD', 'original', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'sequel', 'brief', '10', 'minute', 'retrospective', 'featuring', 'Moira', 'D.B', 'regrettably', 'not', 'include', 'Roy', 'Terry', 'A', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'Cast/Director', 'featurette/commentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'have', 'commentary', ""'m"", 'very', 'grateful', 'got', 'decent', 'Special', 'Edition', 'as', 'well', 'Deluxe', 'Release', 'Soundtrack', 'Full', 'Score', 'Still', 'better', 'got', 'what', 'did', '15', 'years', 'late', 'rather', 'never', 'having', 'gotten', 'movie', 'up', 'amazingly', 'well', 'acting', 'music', 'skating', 'sequences', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'relational', 'dynamics', 'triumph', 'hope', 'despair', 'triumph', 'tragedy', 'love', 'over', 'hate', 'Considering', 'how', 'bad', 'Ice', 'Castles', 'sucked', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'love', 'skating', 'movie', 'saw', 'one', 'Interestingly', 'Moira', 'mentions', 'moved', 'same', 'point', 'always', 'do', 'big', 'Kate', 'need', 'NEED', 'scene.As', 'sequel', 'solid', 'casting', 'Scott', 'Thompson', 'Baker', 'Stefanie', 'Kramer', '20', 'years', 'later', 'version', 'Kate', 'Doug', 'quite', 'well', 'sequel', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'complete', 'total', 'disaster', 'Kramer', 'Baker', 'are', 'hardly', 'impossible-to-believe-it', 'set', 'casting', 'choices', 'older', 'Kate', 'Doug', 'However', 'one', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', ""didn't/could"", ""n't"", 'just', 'bring', 'back', 'D.B', 'Moira', 'movie', 'basically', 'made', 'Interestingly', 'retrospective', 'D.B', 'same', 'Moira', 'aged', 'bit.It', 'fairly', 'inexpensive', 'purchase', 'get', 'new', 'Gold', 'Metal', 'Edition', 'so', 'worth', 'when', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'meant', 'new', 'generation']",The Cutting Edge VHS
411396,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6304286325,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 3/08Rate: 83/08: I was initially told that The Cutting Edge would suck major and I ought to see it for the sake of mockery. Well, I had a pretty good time watching The Cutting Edge and was darned entertained by the quirky love story between two opposites. The first half of the picture was full of sharp sense of humor, witty lines, and terrific chemistry between actors. I saw a slow-down in the second half, but The Cutting Edge managed to finish solidly. Although the picture involves figure-skating, I liked how it was treated as a secondary backdrop setting. The real winners of this film are D.B. Sweeney (this guy is better than Ben Affleck), Moira Kelly (the b****y one), and Roy Dotrice (as the coach). Excellent performances out of them, indeed. There was an interesting usage of camerawork throughout The Cutting Edge, and they seemed to reflect almost of amateurish quality. But I thought the scenes, especially during hockey game and figure skating shows, were tolerable and more pleasant to watch than of current films relying on heavy CGI use. Subplots developed during the film were developed quite nicely, and not too much time was spent on most of them. That's how the director was able to squeeze plenty of time for more scenes. The way the chemistry built up between Doug Dorsey and Kate Moseley paid off dividends in the end when they both realize they are in love with each other and turn in the best skating performance of their lives. Of course, we don't get to see the actual show in its entirety, but that's okay with me. Like I said, figure skating is the secondary part of the film. Some of the underlying messages that came up during the film seem to have me confused and made comprehension difficult. When I say that, I am thinking more of the insecurity that Kate Moseley has, especially with her father. I think that requires another viewing to see if I could ""get"" it next time. Meanwhile, I enjoyed the film immensely, and it's like watching a combination of Rocky and The War of the Roses on ice. All in all, The Cutting Edge is an underrated gem that ought not to be missed, and when you see it, don't be surprised by the warmth feeling that grows in you. What D.B.

Kate Mosley is a spoiled, tempermental skater whose dream of gold was shattered when she fell during her program at the '88 Olympics, and now because of her spoiled personality, she can't keep a partner. Doug Dorsey is an ex-hockey star who during the same event lost his dream when he injured his eye. When Doug finds out what sport he's competing in and later who his partner is, he's intially very reluctant, as is Kate, who can't believe how desperate her coach is to find her a partner that he would have her skate with a hockey player. As time goes on, however, they realize how good they are together and all looks well until they hit one more hurdle. On the night they qualify for the Qlympics, a drunken Kate decides to make her skating partner her sexual partner. But because she's drunk, Doug won't give in to her advances, which makes her angry.

411405,A3TUE4JZMN4HYO,6304286325,"Brian Martin ""foliowyrm""","[6, 6]","I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since.  The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.The movie picks up a few years later with Kate having trouble getting a new partner and Doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player.  Added to the mix is Kate's Russian couch Anton Pamchenko (played by the great Roy Dotrice) who decides Rick will be Kate's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 Olympics.At first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating, but that is not entirely so.  The scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater.  In truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice.  It is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another, to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love.  The thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads Sweeney and Kelly.  They are magic together on the screen, so much so that I am surprised they never paired up again for another movie.I highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone.On a side note about the DVD, the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  There are no deleted scenes.  This is where I have a question, because the version of the film on this DVD and that I've scene on TV in recent years is not the one I remember seeing in college.  I distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony.  I somewhat like that version because what Doug and Kate won in that version was so much more.

After that, knowing that TV presentations cut out soe  of the movie for commercials, I went to buy the video.  I watched the darn  thing an average of 3 times a day for the next 3 weeks.

411422,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6304286325,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[16, 16]","Moira Kelly (Dangerous Beauty, ""The West Wing"") and D. B. Sweeney (Roommates, Memphis Belle) star as polar opposites who unite on the ice for a shot at Olympic gold in this inspirational romantic comedy from acclaimed director Paul M. Glaser (The Running Man).To this day, when it comes to films about figure skating and capturing the essence of training and competition, the 1992 film ""The Cutting Edge"" is considered by fans of the sport to be one of the better films to showcase the sport.Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (the actor known for his classic role in ""Starsky and Hutch"" and director of episodes of ""Miami Vice"" and Las Vegas and the Arnold Schwarzenegger film ""The Running Man"") and written by Tony Gilroy (The ""Bourne"" trilogy, ""Michael Clayton"", ""Duplicity""), ""The Cutting Edge"" was a cutting edge film at the time.Featuring innovative ways to film figure skating, the film would star D.B. Sweeney (""Spawn"", ""Memphis Belle"", ""Fire in the Sky""), Moira Kelly (""Chaplin"", ""One Tree Hill"", ""The West Wing""), Roy Dotrice (""Amadeus"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"") and Terry O'Quinn (""Lost"", ""The X Files"", ""The Step Father"", ""Primal Fear"").VIDEO:""The Cutting Edge"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  Like many films from the late '80s to early '90s, picture quality for many catalog films on Blu-ray are unfortunately not in the best shape.  ""The Cutting Edge"" shows signs of age and definitely has a strong mixture of grain and noise.Granted, picture quality for the film is more likely better compared to its DVD and VHS counterpart, certain scenes with red and blues actually do pop onscreen due to the sharpness but for the most part, picture quality is good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Cutting Edge"" is presented in English 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Dolby Surround and French Dolby Surround.  The film is a front-channel driven lossless soundtrack.  Dialogue and early '90s music is heard crystal clear.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:The Cutting Edge comes with the following special features:The Cutting Edge: Reflections from the Ice - (10:53)  D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly talk about their experience working and training for ""The Cutting Edge"".Theatrical Trailer - (2:04) The original theatrical trailer for ""The Cutting Edge"".JUDGMENT CALL:Have you ever been on the ice and fall down while skating and someone to yell ""toe pick"".  The now used slang on the ice skating rink is derived from the figure skating film ""The Cutting Edge"".There are not many films based on figure skating and for the films I have reviewed over time, sure there will always be ""Ice Castles"" and ""Love Story"" and I felt that back in the '90s, ""The Cutting Edge"" was a pretty awesome film when it came to how they were able to film ice skating and build contraptions in order to capture the skaters and make it look convincing.But to my surprise, what was more interesting was to know that both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly trained in figure skating to the point where they were able to pull of certain moves on their own and make it look convincing on camera.In fact, for Moira Kelly, she took it seriously and her dedication to learning to figure skate and amaze even the trainers because of her dedication to the training and even learning difficult moves quite quickly  (note: Kelly pushed herself so hard that she even fractured her ankle).  Granted, there are scenes of stand-in doubles for the more difficult moves but there are many scenes where you know that the two talents were actually on the ice and were skating.Also, I felt that both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly did a good job with their role and both had great chemistry.  I enjoyed the ""opposites attract"" storyline but of course, for many people who are dedicated to the sport, the fact that a hockey player became a professional figure skater may seem a bit farfetched but I actually enjoyed the back-and-forth exchanges by both characters and felt that Sweeney and Kelly did a great job with their performance.But what about the story?  Granted, the film is quite predictable and the plot is quite formulaic in structure and yes, there are people who know more about the qualifications of athletes in the Olympics and know that the film doesn't capture the true nature of the sport perfectly.  And I'm sure figure skaters would probably be the first people to be fairly critical of the film but one thing that this film has done is inspire many young people to take up figure skating and even Moira Kelly has mentioned how people continue to recognize her from ""The Cutting Edge"" and thank her for inspiring them to join figure skating.As for the Blu-ray release, unfortunately those who are expecting the film to look pristine on Blu-ray may be disappointed to see that the film looks quite aged and for some, the high amount of grain and noise may not be to their liking.  But that's how a lot of films in the late '80s and '90s look and I would rather have the grain that excessive Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) and make the film look overly soft.  But I will say that the film does look much better than its VHS and DVD counterpart.  And as for special features, it was great to have the one special feature featuring both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly many years later to discuss the popularity and their involvement in the film.Overall, the way I felt back in 1992 about the film has not really decrease much in 2011.  Aside from the 2010 release of ""Ice Castles"" which tried to show modern technology capturing the competitive and technical side of ice skating, ""The Cutting Edge"" is an entertaining film that captures two characters who are from different sports, are different type of people and dislike each other but eventually, their dedication to teamwork leads to an appreciation of each other's skill and eventually making them an awesome team.Sure, it's not perfect, nor is it a great film and nor does it capture the authentic nature of the road to the Olympics but even now, in 2011, I still feel that this is one of the better ice skating films out there.""The Cutting Edge"" is charming, uplifting and entertaining.  It's definitely a romantic comedy that shines through the performance by Moira Kelly who is fantastic in this film.  And I also have to say that the chemistry and tension between her and D.B. Sweeney is quite convincing and fun to watch.  Also, if you ever hear someone yell ""Toe Pick"" when you munch on the ice, now you know what film those words came from.Overall, ""The Cutting Edge"" is recommended for those looking for a ""good"" ice skating film but also an entertaining, romantic comedy.",4,"Blu-ray:  ""The Cutting Edge"" is charming, uplifting and entertaining, but the Blu-ray release was OK...",1312156800,"08 1,

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","- Doug's confession to his blue-collar buddies in a crowded bar: ""I've been doing a little... figure skating.""- Doug's incredulous brother: ""You've been doing what?""- A confused voice from the back of the crowd: ""Finger painting...?""A manly man's guilty pleasure: I happen to think that THE CUTTING EDGE is a really good, fun movie, even with the sissy venue and the pretty, pretty outfits. It helps a guy viewer's sensibilities, though, that D.B. Sweeney plays a gritty, down-and-out hockey player who reluctantly shifts to figure skating.She thinks he's a neanderthal. He thinks she's, um, temperamental - but maybe the voice-over in the movie trailer said it best: ""She has a nickname that rhymes with 'rich.'"" 45 seconds away from the Olympic gold medal, and then it all falls apart for gifted figure skater Kate Moseley and her just-not-cutting-it partner. Elsewhere, when Doug Dorsey suffers a horrible injury on the ice, it spells the end of his hockey career. Where else can Doug turn to but... pairs figure skating? He's willing to give it a try. His prickly new partner, Kate, is more skeptical, to put it nicely. She rages at her Russian coach, ""What is this? Final stages of Ukrainian alcohol psychosis?"" Not surprisingly, Kate Moseley goes thru skating partners like tissues (8 partners in 2 years). But we all know it's gonna work out... eventually. That is, after heaps of Kate's smirky ""Toe pick!"" remarks.Not that the story breaks any new ground or anything, but even though it unfolds in conventional ways, it's graced with terrific dialogue, snappy heated banter, nicely developed character arcs, and, most notably, marvelous performances by D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly. And it's no surprise, really, that their roles here are what folks remember most about them. In the bonus feature, Sweeney recounts past experiences in which he'd tripped on something and some stranger had inevitably called out, ""Toe pick!""Sweeney and Kelly bring a palpable heat, some really nice chemistry. D.B. Sweeney is likable from the start, coming off as a regular cat. Moira Kelly has the trickier part because her character is such a, uh, demanding diva. But we eventually do get to see her vulnerable side, and your heart goes to her. Still, she's really great at delivering that offended, nose-turned-up look. Anyway, the contentious rivalry, the training montages, the class war (he comes from a working class community, she's from a filthy rich family), the falling in love unwillingly, the big skating finale at the end as they go for the gold and break out the unholily brutal Pamchenko Twist... these are all easily predicted signposts. But how can you not get pulled in? THE CUTTING EDGE is irresistible stuff, and very romantic.This DVD is the ""Gold Medal Edition"" and includes three bonus features: a sneak peek at THE CUTTING EDGE: GOING FOR THE GOLD (which, by the way, features neither D.B. nor Moira and isn't nearly as good); the original theatrical trailer; and ""THE CUTTING EDGE: Reflections from the Ice"" - an 11-minute-long retrospective as Sweeney and Kelly reminisce about their experiences in making the film. We learn, among other things, that both leads had to learn how to skate in prepping for this movie and that Moira Kelly broke her ankle in the first week of shooting.",5,"""You want my hands where?""",1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,3299,"['Doug', 'confession', 'blue-collar', 'buddies', 'crowded', 'bar', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'little', 'figure', 'skating', 'Doug', 'incredulous', 'brother', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'what', 'confused', 'voice', 'back', 'crowd', 'Finger', 'painting', 'A', 'manly', 'man', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'happen', 'think', 'CUTTING', 'EDGE', 'really', 'good', 'fun', 'movie', 'even', 'sissy', 'venue', 'pretty', 'pretty', 'outfits', 'guy', 'viewer', 'sensibilities', 'though', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'gritty', 'down-and-out', 'hockey', 'player', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'shifts', 'figure', 'skating.She', 'neanderthal', 'um', 'temperamental', 'maybe', 'voice-over', 'movie', 'trailer', 'said', 'best', 'nickname', ""'rich"", '45', 'away', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medal', 'then', 'apart', 'gifted', 'figure', 'skater', 'Kate', 'Moseley', 'just-not-cutting-it', 'partner', 'Elsewhere', 'when', 'Doug', 'Dorsey', 'horrible', 'injury', 'ice', 'end', 'hockey', 'career', 'Where', 'else', 'can', 'Doug', 'turn', 'figure', 'skating', 'willing', 'give', 'try', 'prickly', 'new', 'partner', 'Kate', 'more', 'skeptical', 'put', 'nicely', 'Russian', 'coach', 'What', 'Final', 'stages', 'Ukrainian', 'alcohol', 'psychosis', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Kate', 'Moseley', 'thru', 'skating', 'partners', 'tissues', '8', 'partners', '2', 'years', 'know', 'gon', 'work', 'out', 'eventually', 'heaps', 'Kate', 'smirky', 'Toe', 'pick', 'story', 'new', 'ground', 'anything', 'even', 'conventional', 'ways', 'graced', 'terrific', 'dialogue', 'snappy', 'heated', 'banter', 'nicely', 'developed', 'character', 'arcs', 'most', 'notably', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'surprise', 'really', 'roles', 'here', 'are', 'what', 'folks', 'remember', 'most', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Sweeney', 'past', 'experiences', ""'d"", 'tripped', 'something', 'stranger', 'had', 'inevitably', 'called', 'out', 'Toe', 'pick', 'Sweeney', 'Kelly', 'bring', 'palpable', 'heat', 'really', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'likable', 'start', 'coming', 'off', 'regular', 'cat', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'trickier', 'part', 'character', 'such', 'uh', 'demanding', 'diva', 'eventually', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'heart', 'Still', 'really', 'great', 'delivering', 'offended', 'nose-turned-up', 'look', 'Anyway', 'contentious', 'rivalry', 'training', 'montages', 'class', 'war', 'working', 'class', 'community', 'filthy', 'rich', 'family', 'falling', 'love', 'unwillingly', 'big', 'skating', 'finale', 'end', 'go', 'gold', 'break', 'out', 'unholily', 'brutal', 'Pamchenko', 'Twist', 'are', 'easily', 'predicted', 'signposts', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'pulled', 'CUTTING', 'EDGE', 'irresistible', 'stuff', 'very', 'romantic.This', 'DVD', 'Gold', 'Medal', 'Edition', 'three', 'bonus', 'features', 'sneak', 'peek', 'THE', 'CUTTING', 'EDGE', 'GOING', 'THE', 'GOLD', 'way', 'D.B', 'Moira', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'THE', 'CUTTING', 'EDGE', 'Reflections', 'Ice', '11-minute-long', 'retrospective', 'Sweeney', 'Kelly', 'reminisce', 'experiences', 'making', 'film', 'learn', 'other', 'things', 'leads', 'had', 'learn', 'how', 'skate', 'prepping', 'movie', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'broke', 'ankle', 'first', 'week', 'shooting']",The Cutting Edge VHS

He's in the Olympics and his career is on cloud nine.  He's nearing a lucrative NHL contract that will set him up with millions.  A massive, if not illegal, check from a foreign hockey goon sends his career, his health, and his life into a tailspin.  In walks the Russian coach (or is he a spy?) Pamchenko to change his world.He links Douglas up with vixen Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly), a virtuoso on skates whose heart is just as cold as the ice on which she effortlessly glides.  Her weapon of choice: the deadly toe pick.  TOE PICK!  Her beauty, brains, and ruthlessness rival that of any Bond villain.  Under the tutelage of the Russian, the two team up to take over the world and fill their pockets with gold...via the unjust scoring and judging system of the Olympics.Without a single on-screen sex scene or bloody hockey fight painting the ice red, Dorsey's vigor and testosterone must carry the majority of the movie.  He's left to fend off another threatening injury - a head shot - while overcoming his partner's tendency to fold under pressure.  To overcome the Russian's evil, communist plot he'll have to battle enemies at every stop, bed a gorgeous redhead spy from a heated rival while placating his neurotic partner, and pull off a miraculously daring last feat of flying athleticism that leaves his enemies and Jackie Chan in awe.  Is it too much to accomplish?  Does he have too much to overcome?  It's a rip-roaring good time - complete with a superb early 90s action montage - that is sure to keep everyone interested all the way to the enjoyably predictable end.What?",4,A truly manly movie,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,1750,"['keep', 'telling', 'girlfriend', 'guy', 'movie', 'how', 'see', 'rugged', 'hockey', 'player', 'named', 'Douglas', 'Dorsey', 'DB', 'Sweeney', 'verge', 'greatness', 'Olympics', 'career', 'cloud', 'nine', 'nearing', 'lucrative', 'NHL', 'contract', 'will', 'set', 'up', 'millions', 'massive', 'not', 'illegal', 'check', 'foreign', 'hockey', 'goon', 'career', 'health', 'life', 'tailspin', 'Russian', 'coach', 'spy', 'Pamchenko', 'change', 'world.He', 'links', 'Douglas', 'up', 'vixen', 'Kate', 'Mosley', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'virtuoso', 'skates', 'heart', 'just', 'as', 'cold', 'ice', 'effortlessly', 'glides', 'weapon', 'choice', 'deadly', 'toe', 'pick', 'TOE', 'PICK', 'beauty', 'brains', 'ruthlessness', 'rival', 'Bond', 'villain', 'tutelage', 'Russian', 'two', 'team', 'up', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'fill', 'pockets', 'gold', 'unjust', 'scoring', 'judging', 'system', 'Olympics.Without', 'single', 'on-screen', 'sex', 'scene', 'bloody', 'hockey', 'fight', 'painting', 'ice', 'red', 'Dorsey', 'vigor', 'testosterone', 'must', 'carry', 'majority', 'movie', 'left', 'fend', 'off', 'threatening', 'injury', 'head', 'shot', 'overcoming', 'partner', 'tendency', 'fold', 'pressure', 'overcome', 'Russian', 'evil', 'communist', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'have', 'battle', 'enemies', 'stop', 'bed', 'gorgeous', 'redhead', 'spy', 'heated', 'rival', 'placating', 'neurotic', 'partner', 'pull', 'off', 'miraculously', 'daring', 'last', 'feat', 'flying', 'athleticism', 'enemies', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'awe', 'too', 'much', 'accomplish', 'Does', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'overcome', 'rip-roaring', 'good', 'time', 'complete', 'superb', 'early', '90s', 'action', 'montage', 'sure', 'keep', 'everyone', 'interested', 'way', 'enjoyably', 'predictable', 'end.What']",The Cutting Edge VHS

It's funny, entertaining, serious, and emotional all wrapped into one great movie.  The acting is outstanding.  The best acting comes from, well, everybody.  My personal favorite is Moira Kelly's portrayal of an ice skater with a spoiled brat attitude, Kate Moseley.  D.B Sweeney also does a great job as  conceited ex-hockey star-turned-figure skater, Doug Dorsey.  Supporting actors Terry O'Quinn as Kate's father Jack Moseley and Roy Dotrice as figure skating coach Anton Pamchenko also perform great.My favorite part of the movie is the argument that takes place about the ""button"".  I find it humorous and serious at the same time.  I also like the ""double or nothing"" and ""finger painting"" scenes.I saw this movie in the theater probably seven times back in 1992.  I had never seen the same movie in a theater more than twice before.

Sweeney and the lovely Moira Kelly, two very underrated actors, this movie will keep the viewer entertained. The story revolves around two athletes. One is a top notch, Olympic level, ice hockey player, who sees his potential professional career go down the tubes, when he is injured during the Olympics. The other is the female half of a pairs figure skating team, who choked during the Olympics, ending their quest for the gold.Both are not doing well after their own personal waterloo. He is now playing with amatuer teams, as his injury precludes him from going pro. She, a total prima donna, is busy, going through one skating partner after another with no success. Her coach, knowing that the ex hockey player has a lot of skating talent, contacts him in hopes that maybe he will be the one that will be able to work with his temperamental, Olympic hopeful. He agrees and goes to work on learning the niceties of figure skating. She goes to work on learning to get along with him. Together, they are working towards earning an Olympic Gold medal.There are some delightfully funny and heartwarming scenes in this film. Probably the funniest is the toe pick scene. When you see the film, you will know what I mean. While there is some hockey and figure skating action in this film, it is really not a movie about either sport. It is essentially a romantic comedy that is delightfully directed by Paul Michael Glaser.

In part it's also a sports film--it's about training for the ultimate goal.D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly, both highly underrated actors, breathe charm and life into their characters. Not in spite of but because of their flaws these characters are likeable: Doug Dorsey for his coping with having his dream snatched out from under him, and Kate for all her focus and hard work bent towards a dream that isn't even hers. As they both grow into their new roles, both the romance and the team develop. Because they pull no punches with each other, neither the bond between them nor their performance as a team feels false.On top of everything else, it's a great winter film.

I saw this movie for the first time seventeen years after it came out, and I found it exactly ""Magnifico"".Ice-skating has always represented in my immaginary one of the forms of ""gracefullness"" that can be acheived in competitive sports. Another is surely gymnastics.This very well written movie deals with a beautiful and fascinating sport, but also adds to this advantage a story of failures, dreams, efforts and ""Great Expectations"" (Kate gives Doug this book for Christmas). The plot somewhat resembles ""The Taming of the Shrew"", with a femine character that is whitty, sassy and tempremental and a male character that steadily somehow tames her. However, we don't live in Skakespeare's times anymore, so the parity of sexes must be respected, with also the man giving in at last to love.Nothing is more romantic than the meeting of disparities, and this is exactly what happens here.A pretty, talented, rich, spoiled and introverse young figure skater, Kate Mosely, finds herself without a partner. Thanks to the long eye of her Russian trainer, she has the occasion of trying out the retired hockey player Doug Dorsey, that slightly intimidated by the girl and the situation, but at the same time desiring to skate again and compete decides to pair up with her in the attempt to qualify for the Olympic games.One of the points of force of this movie is the dialogue between the couple which is fast, humoristic and a pleasure to follow. Another is the evident attraction between the actors which goes right to the heart.The scenography is also very good, with the winter scenes that add magic to the atmosphere and the training scenes with the skaters alone on the rink.Obviously some of the sport scenes are impossible, as skaters have rightly pointed out, and the plot resolves as expected, but I believe this movie can be classified as a romantic classic and will stand the test of time.",5,Magnifico!,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,1974,"['English', 'words', 'most', 'emotions', 'sometimes', 'Italian', 'more', 'effective', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'seventeen', 'years', 'came', 'out', 'found', 'exactly', 'Magnifico', '.Ice-skating', 'always', 'represented', 'immaginary', 'one', 'forms', 'gracefullness', 'can', 'be', 'acheived', 'competitive', 'sports', 'surely', 'gymnastics.This', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'movie', 'deals', 'beautiful', 'fascinating', 'sport', 'also', 'advantage', 'story', 'failures', 'dreams', 'efforts', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'Kate', 'Doug', 'book', 'Christmas', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'femine', 'character', 'whitty', 'sassy', 'tempremental', 'male', 'character', 'steadily', 'somehow', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'Skakespeare', 'times', 'anymore', 'parity', 'sexes', 'must', 'be', 'respected', 'also', 'man', 'giving', 'last', 'love.Nothing', 'more', 'romantic', 'meeting', 'disparities', 'exactly', 'what', 'here.A', 'pretty', 'talented', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'introverse', 'young', 'figure', 'skater', 'Kate', 'Mosely', 'partner', 'Thanks', 'long', 'eye', 'Russian', 'trainer', 'occasion', 'trying', 'out', 'retired', 'hockey', 'player', 'Doug', 'Dorsey', 'slightly', 'intimidated', 'girl', 'situation', 'same', 'time', 'desiring', 'skate', 'again', 'compete', 'decides', 'pair', 'up', 'attempt', 'qualify', 'Olympic', 'games.One', 'points', 'force', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'couple', 'fast', 'humoristic', 'pleasure', 'follow', 'evident', 'attraction', 'actors', 'right', 'heart.The', 'scenography', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'winter', 'scenes', 'add', 'magic', 'atmosphere', 'training', 'scenes', 'skaters', 'alone', 'rink.Obviously', 'sport', 'scenes', 'are', 'impossible', 'skaters', 'have', 'rightly', 'pointed', 'out', 'plot', 'expected', 'believe', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'romantic', 'classic', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time']",The Cutting Edge VHS

That, in a nut shell is the basic premise behind this movie, but the journey of getting there is the real heart of this movie.The romance which develops between the two lead characters adds nothing new to the genre and follows the standard formula almost to the letter.  The initial hostility they shared towards one another at the beginning, the byplay that develops as they get to know one another, the leading towards romance, the inevitable misunderstanding, and then finally getting together.  However, the two leads are both attractive people, and they have a strong onscreen chemistry together which makes their romance seem believable, and a joy to watch.The figure skating in the movie is highly enjoyable to watch, even for someone like me who isn't into figure skating as a general rule.  I do have to wonder whether the finishing move they use at the end of the movie is really possible to pull off though.

He ends up accepting the offer and it turns out that his partner is nothing but a spoilt prima donna who is a bad tempered brat used to getting her own way by constantly throwing tantrums.  Well, it seems the reason she needed a new partner was because she had driven all of her old partners away for some reason or other.  She nearly achieves the same with Doug but he hangs tough and gives back as good as he gets.

In fact, he says he even actually likes figure skating after he figures out he has a talent for the sport.Through the story, Kate and Doug learn to deal with their different backgrounds and find common ground. While their relationship seems doomed from the start, somehow they manage to skate over the thin ice and reach a place that is warm and secure.What I liked most about this movie is that Doug doesn't take advantage of Kate when she is at her most vulnerable point in the movie.

Although somewhat predictable, this movie does not give in so  quickly to the characters obvious attraction, and allows it to unfold  naturally, sticking close to how I believe Kate and Doug, had they been  real, would behave.  When first deciding to watch the movie I was somewhat sceptical but was  pleasantly surprised by  both director and the actors ability to light up  the screen with a funny script that so easily could have ended up in the  wrong hands.

Cheesy but fun music throughout, and of course the storyline is very predictable, but there is just something irresistible about it. Kate needs a figure-skating partner. Doug can't land a position on any hockey team due to permanent damage resulting from an injury at an Olympic game. The 2 get paired together as a last resort by Kate's skating coach. It seems so silly...I mean, as I type this review, I'm thinking this is going off the charts on the cheesy scale. But if you love romantic comedies, this is one you will definitely watch over and over and over again. My cousin and I wore out her VHS of it back in college.
