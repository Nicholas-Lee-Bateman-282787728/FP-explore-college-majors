1256194,A2K4G6SMXVP69R,B0028SVY3Y,Earline Taylor,"[2, 2]","Though this series is being sold with both of the available seasons, I would much rather buy a series offered in its entirety. That way I will have the entire show all at once. The thing that is wrong with that is often I, like many other fans cannot afford that at the time or the series is simply priced to high. Believe me, studios know what they are doing when they release these series by the season. They know that fans will buy them that way because they are more affordable at that time. But then when the fans buy by volume then it becomes a nuisance, and a headache. Usually not because we are just waiting for the next volume, but we are also wondering and waiting for the next season.This series has not seen another season release since August 4, 2009. This is a shame because it is such a good, quality show. Fun and fantasy at it's best. And for such a low price too. One of the things I have come to realize is many shows often goes down in price once they have been available for awhile. If a fan is willing to wait, eventually the price may become far more attractive than the original selling price. If you're like me, you wouldn't prefer to wait. I prefer to get my copy as soon as it becomes available. I don't like to wait on enjoyment, which is probably why so many fans are upset about pricing and having to buy in volumes.Another thing that I don't like is the way the discs are formatted. I truly dislike the disc returning to the menu after each episode. However, the disc does scroll to the next episode, which is good, just in case you don't have your remote control. So every forty-five minutes or so I am returning to start the next episode. I prefer a ""Play All"" feature. Though it is wonderful to have the episodic promos, which can be viewed separately or played with the episode and ""The Movie Of The Week: The New Love Boat"" on season one, volume two, it just doesn't justify this cost. It would be better to buy each of these separately, but probably all at the same time to avoid extra postage cost.",3,"THIS PRICING IS WHY SHOWS SHOULDN'T BE SOLD IN THEIR ENTIRETY, INITIALLY",1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,2037,"['series', 'being', 'sold', 'available', 'seasons', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'buy', 'series', 'offered', 'entirety', 'way', 'will', 'have', 'entire', 'show', 'once', 'thing', 'wrong', 'often', 'many', 'other', 'fans', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'time', 'series', 'simply', 'priced', 'high', 'Believe', 'studios', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'when', 'release', 'series', 'season', 'know', 'fans', 'will', 'buy', 'way', 'are', 'more', 'affordable', 'time', 'then', 'when', 'fans', 'buy', 'volume', 'then', 'nuisance', 'headache', 'Usually', 'not', 'are', 'just', 'waiting', 'next', 'volume', 'are', 'also', 'wondering', 'waiting', 'next', 'season.This', 'series', 'not', 'seen', 'season', 'release', 'August', '4', '2009', 'shame', 'such', 'good', 'quality', 'show', 'Fun', 'fantasy', 'best', 'such', 'low', 'price', 'too', 'One', 'things', 'have', 'come', 'realize', 'many', 'shows', 'often', 'down', 'price', 'once', 'have', 'been', 'available', 'awhile', 'fan', 'willing', 'wait', 'eventually', 'price', 'may', 'become', 'far', 'more', 'attractive', 'original', 'selling', 'price', ""'re"", 'would', ""n't"", 'prefer', 'wait', 'prefer', 'get', 'copy', 'as', 'soon', 'available', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'wait', 'enjoyment', 'probably', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'are', 'upset', 'pricing', 'having', 'buy', 'volumes.Another', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'discs', 'are', 'formatted', 'truly', 'disc', 'returning', 'menu', 'episode', 'However', 'disc', 'scroll', 'next', 'episode', 'good', 'just', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'remote', 'control', 'So', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'so', 'am', 'returning', 'start', 'next', 'episode', 'prefer', 'Play', 'All', 'feature', 'wonderful', 'have', 'episodic', 'promos', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'separately', 'played', 'episode', 'Movie', 'Week', 'New', 'Love', 'Boat', 'season', 'one', 'volume', 'two', 'just', ""n't"", 'justify', 'cost', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'buy', 'separately', 'probably', 'same', 'time', 'avoid', 'extra', 'postage', 'cost']",The Love Boat: Two Season Pack

In fact THE LOVE BOAT was part of ABC's popular Saturday night lineup that included FANTASY ISLAND until that show ended in the Summer of 1984 and TJ HOOKER until it was ousted by ABC in the Summer of 1985.Something else that baffled me about this dramedy was how the ships Dr. Adam Bricker(Bernie Koppell)was always getting laid while a bunch of other guest starred passengers were humping around too, even before sex, violence, and profanity corrupted television, including raunchy sitcoms like MARRIED WITH CHILDREN.The original 1976 television film on which the show was based (also titled The Love Boat) was itself based on the nonfiction book The Love Boats by Jeraldine Saunders, a real-life cruise director.It's also nice to be able to watch each episode complete & uncut without all those added commercials & deleted scenes you got when this show was on ME-TV, TV Land, and E!",4,The Hubba Hubba Boat,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,1149,"['LOVE', 'BOAT', 'was', 'dramedy', 'ran', 'ABC', '1977-86', 'revolving', 'ship', 'captain', 'handful', 'crew', 'several', 'passengers', 'played', 'different', 'guest', 'actors', 'celebrities', 'cameos', 'episode', 'having', 'romantic', 'humorous', 'adventures', 'fact', 'THE', 'LOVE', 'BOAT', 'was', 'part', 'ABC', 'popular', 'Saturday', 'night', 'lineup', 'included', 'FANTASY', 'ISLAND', 'show', 'ended', 'Summer', '1984', 'TJ', 'HOOKER', 'was', 'ousted', 'ABC', 'Summer', '1985.Something', 'else', 'baffled', 'dramedy', 'was', 'how', 'ships', 'Dr.', 'Adam', 'Bricker', 'Bernie', 'Koppell', 'was', 'always', 'getting', 'laid', 'bunch', 'other', 'guest', 'starred', 'passengers', 'were', 'humping', 'around', 'too', 'even', 'sex', 'violence', 'profanity', 'corrupted', 'television', 'including', 'raunchy', 'sitcoms', 'MARRIED', 'WITH', 'CHILDREN.The', 'original', '1976', 'television', 'film', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'also', 'titled', 'Love', 'Boat', 'was', 'based', 'nonfiction', 'book', 'Love', 'Boats', 'Jeraldine', 'Saunders', 'real-life', 'cruise', 'director.It', 'also', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'episode', 'complete', 'uncut', 'added', 'commercials', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'got', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'ME-TV', 'TV', 'Land', 'E']",The Love Boat: Two Season Pack
