1146851,A3NQSMTG612AF,B0014FAIWU,,"[3, 5]","I have been waiting for this series to be released on DVD for eight years, since I bought my first DVD player, and finally, it has arrived. I simply cannot understand why it took so long, based on its presumably enormous cult following (basically, everyone that's ever seen it has been waiting for its DVD release as impatiently as I have), but let's not dwell on that any longer.""TV funhouse"" matches even ""The Simpsons"" (when I mention ""The Simpsons,"" I mean the show that existed before season nine; it became a different series at that point (see: witless and aimed at the politically/socially unaware)) in pure knee-slapping, literally burst-out-loud-laughing hilarity, and it simply MUST be owned on DVD by anyone who enjoys, well, hilarious stuff! Stemming from SNL, one of the unfunniest shows on television for at least the last fifteen years, I was simply *shocked* to realize how amazingly funny it actually is; I stayed up on multiple occasions to watch the marathons, as did millions of others (despite the low ""ratings""), and I have seen each episode at least ten times as a result. With each additional viewing, its brilliance becomes ever more apparent, and I will simply never be tired of it.Why, might you ask? ""TV Funhouse"" is mostly a satirical commentary/parody of children's programming (Sesame Street, Mr. Rodgers, etc.) that takes the false image of perfect happiness and harmony and twists it into harsh reality (the implied psychosis of the host, animal mistreatment, etc.), and despite the reality of the images it presents, it's all absolutely hilarious, as previously mentioned. The program also mocks cartoons of the 60's/70's (Wonderman, Fetal Scooby Doo...absolutely priceless...), as well as other 50's-era ""programming"" (mnemonics, etc. ...hilarious).I, for one, feel that a petition should be created to get this show back on the air ASAP! I will never understand, despite its squarely adult audience, why it never got the critical support it deserved, and why it was cancelled in its infancy as a result (especially as ""The Simpsons"" remains on the air, at least ten years ahead of the most recent time it could be deemed ""funny"" (""painful"" is now the term I hear applied most frequently)).In any event, should you be one of the poor, unfortunate souls that has never experienced Comedy Central's ""TV Funhouse"" (and for God's sake, I am NOT referring to the garbage of the same name on SNL that this ingenious creation ""originated"" from...), you simply MUST purchase this set now. Honestly, I don't know how anyone couldn't enjoy it, on one level or another (well, I suppose that animal rights' advocates might have some issues with it, but...).

This show was some of the most disturbingly hilarious comedy I've ever seen.  I'll never forget the bit where Triumph is humping the poodle in the park and can't free himself (""it's not funny.  I was f@#?ing this dog and got stuuuuck."") I haven't even seen the episodes since I saw them on Comedy Central (I think this show came out in 2000?).  Robert Smigel is behind this show, so you know you're in for some highly original and smart comedy.

This show is in the same realm as The Uncle Floyd Show, but with a bit of remarkably sophisticated effort put into it. As an adult, I still enjoy kids shows and cartoons, so the spoofs done here are delicious if you recognize the source material. The truly demented social commentary is on the surface rightfully goofy, but abrasive enough to be thought provoking. I really believe these episodes should be shown in schools and discussed.
