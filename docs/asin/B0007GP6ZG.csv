The movie is about death (or the possibility of it). It seems to imply that some go into a holding world to make the choice whether they want to die or &#34;come back&#34; to life again.

Dealing with sensitive subjects on life, death, love, and sex, parents should be forewarned that this isn't some feel-good Disney flick (although it has some of its elements).The story is that of Ryan Flynn (Ryan Kelley), a boy coming into his teens who is a self-imposed mute. He doesn't speak just because he doesn't want to; he witnessed a horrible accident that claimed his father's life several years ago and hasn't uttered a word since, much to the dismay of his mother (Kim Myers) and stepfather (Peter Horton). His grandfather (Armin Mueller-Stahl) lives with them but suffers from the end stages of Alzheimer's, not even realizing that his wife has passed on. Ryan's best friend Rocky (Michael Angarano,24 TV Series) understands his muteness and doesn't pressure him, just lets him be. Until one day they're crossing an old train bridge and Ryan falls through into the murky water below.When he resurfaces, everything has changed. Rocky is nowhere to be seen. His home is empty with the exception of his grandfather ...who can now talk! And so can Ryan! Learning that he's in some sort of limbo, Ryan soon befriends a pretty young girl his own age named Melanie (Hayden Panettiere) who shows him the ropes of this unique place. Taking him to the big-top where some freakish mimes play out the fate of people's afterlife, Ryan learns that once you take the plunge on the trapeze, things will never be the same. You either ""move on""or you return to the Dust Factory (i.e., life as you knew it before limbo).Battling his uncomfortable past, Ryan often sees railroad tracks blocking his way (his father was killed at a railroad crossing) and must force himself to move onward instead of looking back. He is helped tremendously by his tricky grandfather and, initially, by Melanie. But grandpa can't stay in this place forever, a sad but necessary thing, while Melanie refuses to leave (will she become a mime herself if she never leaves?) Ryan battles for Melanie's soul as much as his own and soon comes to terms with what it means to live life to its fullest.Although exceptionally predictable and not very well acted, the bizarre afterlife world created here makes for some interesting post-film discussion with your tweens. Parents will be able to ask their kids what they think the mimes represented. And why was it necessary for the grandfather to move on.It's a mixed bag as far as films go, but the creepiness of the big-top and its dark tones make up for many of its faults.",3,"Not For The Very Young, But Good For Tweens",1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,2556,"['DUST', 'FACTORY', 'more', 'tween', 'film', 'one', 'younger', 'kids', 'Dealing', 'sensitive', 'subjects', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'sex', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned', ""n't"", 'feel-good', 'Disney', 'flick', 'elements', '.The', 'story', 'Ryan', 'Flynn', 'Ryan', 'Kelley', 'boy', 'coming', 'teens', 'who', 'self-imposed', 'mute', ""n't"", 'speak', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'witnessed', 'horrible', 'accident', 'claimed', 'father', 'life', 'several', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'uttered', 'word', 'much', 'dismay', 'mother', 'Kim', 'Myers', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'grandfather', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'suffers', 'end', 'stages', 'Alzheimer', 'not', 'even', 'realizing', 'wife', 'passed', 'Ryan', 'best', 'friend', 'Rocky', 'Michael', 'Angarano,24', 'TV', 'Series', 'muteness', ""n't"", 'pressure', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'day', ""'re"", 'crossing', 'old', 'train', 'bridge', 'Ryan', 'murky', 'water', 'below.When', 'everything', 'changed', 'Rocky', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'home', 'empty', 'exception', 'grandfather', 'who', 'can', 'now', 'talk', 'so', 'can', 'Ryan', 'Learning', 'sort', 'limbo', 'Ryan', 'soon', 'pretty', 'young', 'girl', 'own', 'age', 'named', 'Melanie', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'who', 'ropes', 'unique', 'place', 'Taking', 'big-top', 'where', 'freakish', 'mimes', 'play', 'out', 'fate', 'people', 'afterlife', 'Ryan', 'once', 'take', 'plunge', 'trapeze', 'things', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'either', 'move', 'return', 'Dust', 'Factory', 'i.e.', 'life', 'knew', 'limbo', '.Battling', 'uncomfortable', 'past', 'Ryan', 'often', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'blocking', 'way', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'railroad', 'crossing', 'must', 'force', 'move', 'onward', 'instead', 'looking', 'back', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'tricky', 'grandfather', 'initially', 'Melanie', 'grandpa', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'place', 'forever', 'sad', 'necessary', 'thing', 'Melanie', 'leave', 'will', 'become', 'mime', 'herself', 'never', 'Ryan', 'Melanie', 'soul', 'as', 'much', 'own', 'soon', 'terms', 'what', 'live', 'life', 'fullest.Although', 'exceptionally', 'predictable', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'bizarre', 'afterlife', 'world', 'created', 'here', 'interesting', 'post-film', 'discussion', 'tweens', 'Parents', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'ask', 'kids', 'what', 'think', 'mimes', 'represented', 'why', 'was', 'necessary', 'grandfather', 'move', 'on.It', 'mixed', 'bag', 'as', 'far', 'films', 'go', 'creepiness', 'big-top', 'dark', 'tones', 'make', 'up', 'many', 'faults']",N/A

The movie relies on good old fashioned storytelling which is something you don't see much in kids' films anymore.

This is a good example of the level of quality a great writer and director can acheive together.A boy with elective mutism who has a lot of mixed feelings about life and death, as well as a grandfather in advanced stages of Alzheimers, falls into a lake and seemingly drowns. He instead goes to a strange and almost surrealistically perfect world called The Dust Factory. There he meets a girl able to skate on water as well as his grandfather who in this world, is able to talk and move about without a worry to be found. At first, he decides this is a great place of perfection, and that he would love to stay forever. Later on, through many lessons learned, he rethinks that decision and decides that perhaps there is a life to go back to in the real world.The direction and scope of this movie is enormous at times. It isn't preachy in it's messages, all of which are of great value, and it doesn't dilute it's merits by subverting to treating young people like they are lesser people than that of adults. The only gripe i have about the movie is that it seemed too short, As if there were more story to tell somewhere along the way and for whatever reason, the director chose not to include some scenes. Its a DVD sparse of features although there is a very brief look behind the scenes of the film.

880691,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0007GP6ZG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 5]","THE DUST FACTORY (2004, 102 minutes) was an oddly European-looking American film I waited some years to see. The preview suggested something indecipherable and was therefore useless. Also, as I recall it was only fairly recently shown on pay-per-view cable, making me think it was a newer film. When I finally saw it, tonight in fact, and saw how young Michael Angarano is here, well, I knew something funny was happening with my mental processing. Then I noticed the date. What gives with this sort of thing, this delayed release, anyway?In fact this whole film is 'funny' and very difficult to review. It was somewhat intriguing for me on a purely metaphysical level. Yet the thing was so flat and disappointing I can't actually understand its raison d'tre as cinema. A sweet and compelling Ryan Kelley (Prayers for Bobby) plays Ryan Flynn, a teen who is mute because of witnessing the death of his father. His best friend - who seems to have no point or value whatsoever - is Michael Angarano.After suffering a fall from a bridge into a river, Ryan is transported to ""The Dust Factory"", which struck me as a place where people go when they are just-about-dead but still have the power to decide if they'll die or return. In effect, the Factory may very well be where we all must go in order to gain the wisdom to know if life still needs us or not - in reality, I do not know what the heck goes on here. During his time in that place (slightly reminiscent ofBeetlejuice), he is counseled by his grandfather (the usually stern and frightening Armin Mueller-Stahl).So, in this happy limbo people come to the decision whether to pass on to heaven I presume, or return to earth. In any event, is there any doubt that Ryan will return and live? It was that question that also made me wonder why anyone would waste a minute on a film like this. Teens are facing problems and this film might - I say MIGHT - answer a few of those difficulties, but it is beyond me. A relief is the quality in the whole thing: the acting, the stars, the music, the gentleness of the great family films of decades long gone. However, that is not enough to justify a film.Especially when the reviewer (yours truly) is still seething angry that there hasn't yet been a proper metaphysical romance film for gay teens. Probably never will be. That angers me, and so does Wallyweird's homophobia. The two boys in this film, in my opinion, should have been gay.In the end I can only say this will either touch you in some way or it will leave you cold and unimpressed. Since I love Kelley and Angarano (I'm a lifelong fan of his meaning I took note of him when he was very small and haven't missed too many of his films since), this film absolutely mesmerized me on that level - but it was only because of that.",3,"""Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return.""-",1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,2782,"['DUST', 'FACTORY', '2004', '102', 'minutes', 'was', 'oddly', 'European-looking', 'American', 'film', 'waited', 'years', 'see', 'preview', 'suggested', 'something', 'indecipherable', 'was', 'therefore', 'useless', 'Also', 'recall', 'was', 'only', 'fairly', 'recently', 'shown', 'pay-per-view', 'cable', 'making', 'think', 'was', 'newer', 'film', 'When', 'finally', 'saw', 'tonight', 'fact', 'saw', 'how', 'young', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'here', 'well', 'knew', 'something', 'funny', 'was', 'happening', 'mental', 'processing', 'Then', 'noticed', 'date', 'What', 'sort', 'thing', 'delayed', 'release', 'anyway', 'fact', 'whole', 'film', 'very', 'difficult', 'review', 'was', 'somewhat', 'intriguing', 'purely', 'metaphysical', 'level', 'thing', 'was', 'so', 'flat', 'disappointing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'understand', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'cinema', 'sweet', 'compelling', 'Ryan', 'Kelley', 'Prayers', 'Bobby', 'Ryan', 'Flynn', 'teen', 'who', 'mute', 'witnessing', 'death', 'father', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'have', 'point', 'value', 'whatsoever', 'Michael', 'Angarano.After', 'suffering', 'fall', 'bridge', 'river', 'Ryan', 'transported', 'Dust', 'Factory', 'struck', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'go', 'when', 'are', 'just-about-dead', 'still', 'have', 'power', 'decide', ""'ll"", 'die', 'return', 'effect', 'Factory', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'where', 'must', 'go', 'order', 'gain', 'wisdom', 'know', 'life', 'still', 'not', 'reality', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'heck', 'here', 'time', 'place', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'ofBeetlejuice', 'counseled', 'grandfather', 'usually', 'stern', 'frightening', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', '.So', 'happy', 'limbo', 'people', 'come', 'decision', 'pass', 'heaven', 'presume', 'return', 'earth', 'event', 'there', 'doubt', 'Ryan', 'will', 'return', 'live', 'was', 'question', 'also', 'made', 'wonder', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'waste', 'minute', 'film', 'Teens', 'are', 'facing', 'problems', 'film', 'might', 'say', 'MIGHT', 'answer', 'few', 'difficulties', 'relief', 'quality', 'whole', 'thing', 'acting', 'stars', 'music', 'gentleness', 'great', 'family', 'films', 'decades', 'long', 'gone', 'However', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'film.Especially', 'when', 'reviewer', 'truly', 'still', 'seething', 'angry', ""n't"", 'yet', 'been', 'proper', 'metaphysical', 'romance', 'film', 'gay', 'teens', 'Probably', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'Wallyweird', 'homophobia', 'two', 'boys', 'film', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'will', 'either', 'touch', 'way', 'will', 'leave', 'cold', 'unimpressed', 'love', 'Kelley', 'Angarano', ""'m"", 'lifelong', 'fan', 'meaning', 'took', 'note', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'small', 'have', ""n't"", 'missed', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'film', 'absolutely', 'mesmerized', 'level', 'was', 'only']",N/A

And they need to learn from those older and more experienced in the problems of life.My only fault with this movie, and I consider it an important one, (I still give it a 4 Star rating) is that once again our North American society has to have everything so politically correct that religion, and God are barely mentioned.

All ethics have originally come from religion (Read the history of ethics if you doubt my word) and this is a very strong movie about ideas/problems that religion has answers for and gives meaning to (i.e. death, the afterlife, respect for ones elders, faith & true happiness).My wife and I lost two sons (one in his 20's and the other in his 30's).

880697,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0007GP6ZG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","I can certainly understand why some people have connected with ""The Dust Factory."" At least it attempts something intriguing. This is an existential fantasy that explores a world of ""limbo,"" a place between life and death. It's a rather fantastical world, too--what with the circus standing as the surreal exit from this idyllic place. As a film geared toward younger viewers, I suppose there are some interesting ideas and visuals to recommend the film. However, for me, the execution was cutesy and cloying. I didn't expect a film about life and death to contain such contrived ""preciousness.""Ryan Kelley plays a teenager who has remained mute since the death of his father. It's one of those classic movie cliches--this boy must be fixed. One day, he plunges off a bridge and appears to be drowning. He is transported to The Dust Factory. In this world, he meets his Grandfather (who in the real world was disconnected with Alzheimer's). Of course, here his Grandfather is fully capable and loaded with charm and wisdom. He also meets a young girl played by Hayden Panettiere. She is impossibly cute and upbeat, so obviously lives in denial about her real circumstances. They form a tentative romance and together contemplate never leaving this world.With some heavy-handed metaphors, the exit to The Dust Factory is a trapeze act. If you are successful, you move to another realm. If not, you're reduced to dust and return to the physical world. The circus ringleader is a vague reference to death--at one point, Kelley even plays hockey with ""death"" to win Panetierre's freedom (not quite the chess game from ""The Seventh Seal""--but similar in conception).I was never particularly captivated by the fantasies within ""The Dust Factory,"" but that wasn't my biggest issue. I just found the whole thing emotionally manipulative--sweet and sugary. Many find that this film doesn't talk down to kids--I don't know, maybe I was a rather sophisticated kid (or maybe just emotionally stunted). The romance is cutesy cute, the lessons obvious, and the cliches abundant. A good idea, but it just didn't work for me.

880699,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0007GP6ZG,Only-A-Child,"[10, 13]","Contrary to popular belief, films do not have to be dumbed-down for children. Much of the pleasure they get comes from puzzling out complex plot developments and recognizing subtle details. And there is actually a small sub-genre of children's films (mostly independents) that challenge young viewers to use their imaginations and film viewing skills.""The Dust Closet"" joins ""An Angel for May"" and ""Restless Spirits"" as the best recent examples of this type of film. These films have a hidden depth to their story and storytelling technique that will interest even the most sophisticated viewer-provided that they retain at least some of their childhood capacity for wonder. The weak vote count probably reflects viewers unable or unwilling to deal with a film that requires some mental energy and a few functioning brain cells.Ryan Flynn (Ryan Kelley) is a teenager who has refused to speak since being traumatized when he saw his father killed at a train crossing. Ryan's father died when Ryan was nine years old, but not before he passed on a passion for astronomy to his son. But now Ryan is having trouble connecting with astronomy, symbolized by his inability to find the man in the moon his father drew for him. Like an impressionist painting, the moonscape becomes meaningless when viewed close up through his new telescope.Ryan's family takes care of his grandfather (Mueller-Stahl), but Ryan barely knows him because he has had Alzheimer's for a number of years. Ryan hangs out with his best friend Rocky (Michael Angarano), and they communicate fine nonverbally. Rocky does not question Ryan's silence-he just accepts it. Things dramatically change one day when Ryan falls off a bridge and into a lake while roller-blading. When he surfaces Rocky is gone and everything is a little off-kilter. His grandfather is completely recovered and living alone it their house, which was his originally. They have meaningful conversations and his grandfather tries to pass on advice on how to get the most out of life. Ryan meets a pretty girl his own age named Melanie (Hayden Panettiere) who can ice skate on the surface of the lake-even though to Ryan it is summer and the lake is not frozen.The story is basically told from Ryan's point of view and we learn along with him that this new reality is a place called ""The Dust Factory"". The film is an allegory (the expression by symbolic means of generalizations about human existence) about the process of living; much like ""Groundhog Day"". The idea is that most of us just go through the motions of living (each day is just a repeat of the day before). The themes are basically the same, the importance of having the courage to live life to the fullest and to get the most out of each day.""Groundhog Day"" illustrated this by having one day keep repeating itself for the main character . ""The Dust Factory"" does it by creating a symbolic place between life and death. This place is populated by all those in a coma state, their bodies are alive but their conscious mind is no longer functioning. The circus ring is the point where people finally decide whether to get on with living or to get on with dying (a line I borrow from ""Shawshank Redemption"").Either choice is a valid alternative depending mostly on what stage you are at in your life (the grandfather chooses death-the teenagers choose to live for a while longer). The wrong thing is being stuck there in limbo, afraid to risk it in the circus ring. Such people are called dawdlers and symbolize the day-to-day existence of many people. But ""The Dust Factory"" is also a place where people can pull back and take an objective and distanced look at their lives; seeing things from this perspective allows them to recognize things (like the man in the moon) they were too close to see before (the forest for the trees). Those who come back have no conscious memory of the place (they have been dreaming while in a coma) but subconsciously retain things they have learned; like the Grandfather's advice to not forget that you are on a quest for paradise, and that a fear of dying or hurting keeps you from letting go of security and really living. It takes some work to sort this film out and it probably should be viewed several times because it withholds a lot of its pleasure from the first viewing. The cast does a first-rate job. Panettiere is unexpectedly effective. In her prior film work, her extreme self-assurance overwhelms the character she is playing and works against her performances. Here she plays someone who uses a cocky attitude to hide her fear and insecurity. This multi- dimensionality connects with viewers who then relate to the protectiveness Ryan develops toward Melanie.The movie goes out on a painfully sappy duet ""Someone Like You,"" performed by Panettiere and Kelley (she can sing-he cannot). My advice would be to hit the off button very early in the closing credits.Then again, what do I know?

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[1, 1]","The Dust Factory is one of those films with a long sequence where you can't tell if it's real or a dream - not until the end. Ryan Kelley (until now best known for guest appearances as Ryan on Samallville) is a troubled boy who's been mute since the trauma of witnessing his father's violent death in a train accident, several years ago. Now, after his grandmother's funeral Ryan skates across an old bridge to go fishing with a friend. But a rail collapses and Ryan falls in the river, knocked unconscious. This is when the ""dream"" sequence begins, where he meets a girl, Melanie (Hayden Panettiere) and speaks to his grandfather (who has had alzheimer's and hasn't talked for a while), informing the apparently revitalized old man of his wife's death. But no one else is around. Has Ryan died and gone to heaven? Purgatory? An alien experiment? Or is he dreaming in a near-death state? Can Ryan and Melanie stay together for ever in this place, or must they somehow move on to find paradise? While this dream sequence that comprises most of the movie suffers from heavy symbolism, it's entertaining and romantic, and the end is satisfying. I think this is one of the best films of it's kind in several years that's suitable for the whole family.

This is an underrated gem and I can't even begin to understand why this has a 9% on rotten tomatoes?Like I said this film is a hidden gem and it's a shame it has received no attention but then again it makes it all the more special. This film, despite the PG rating isn't exactly for young children. This is not to say it is inappropriate for young children but children may not exactly grasp the film. I first saw this when I was about 11 and have seen it a few times since. I will give a brief synopsis of this film without giving away any spoilers as I don't want to ruin anything for you.*****NO SPOILERS*****The film starts out with a young teenage boy who is struggling with death and depression in his life. An accident causes him to travel to a place called ""the dust factory"" which is a place between heaven and earth. In this place one must eventually take a ""leap of faith"" to decide whether they move onto heaven or go back to their suffering life on earth. He also meets two very important people here.I am going to stop the synopsis at that as I don't want to spoil anything. Everything in this film has a meaning and there is so much symbolism that this film requires more than one viewing. Every scene and character in this film has a meaning and it is beautiful. There are so many subtle and well done messages in this film about death, suffering, and overcoming ones losses in order to find peace and move on. This film is so uplifting without being sappy which seems to be hard to do nowadays. I was so happy to stumble upon this film and can't stress how beautiful it is.

I intend to buy the movie, as it is something that I will watch again from time to time.The story is about love, faith, death, bereavement and overcoming fear: it leads one to look deeper. There are beautiful scenes depicting an ideal of serenity, the sort of shots that make you sigh as you acknowledge the beauty.  I think this movie could be helpful in taking away fear of death and could also be helpful for the newly bereaved.Overall this is a heart-warming movie and leaves one feeling happy and strangely moved &#8211; probably wanting to see it again. I highly recommend it to anyone who is open to looking deeper,  not taking the symbolism literally.",5,"Fun, deep and really worthwhile!",1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,747,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'film', 'want', 'watch', 'once', 'again', 'rental', 'intend', 'buy', 'movie', 'something', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'time', 'time.The', 'story', 'love', 'faith', 'death', 'bereavement', 'overcoming', 'fear', 'one', 'look', 'deeper', 'are', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'ideal', 'serenity', 'sort', 'shots', 'make', 'sigh', 'acknowledge', 'beauty', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'helpful', 'taking', 'away', 'fear', 'death', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'helpful', 'newly', 'bereaved.Overall', 'heart-warming', 'movie', 'one', 'feeling', 'happy', 'strangely', 'moved', '8211', 'probably', 'wanting', 'see', 'again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'open', 'looking', 'deeper', 'not', 'taking', 'symbolism', 'literally']",N/A

880708,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0007GP6ZG,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[6, 9]","The Dust Factory is a story about the hope and spiritual recovery of an emotionally and physically traumatized boy named Ryan(Ryan Kelley). Ever since witnessing the train ran over his father at the age of nine, he had became mute and internally depressed. One day, while rollerblading on an old bridge, he fell into the river and it instantly put him into a coma. In his mind, he entered an imaginary land somewhere between Heaven and Earth, and met Melanie(Hayden Panettiere), who skates on the water of the lake, while she's trapped in that dimension. They became friends instantly, and she took him to the Dust Factory, where folks would make their leap into other Dimensions or return to where they came from.Later, Ryan and Melanie ran into his Grandpa(Armin Mueller-Stahl), who was severely afflicted by Alzheimers, and was in the process of making a transition from life back to Heaven, which means he was dying already when Ryan was in the coma. Grandpa helped Ryan understand the importance of life and that he must summon his courage to make the leap so he can return to his mother......This film showcased wonderful performances from the three leads, and I especially loved Hayden Panettiere's character. There's not a whole lot of special effects used, but the story is filled with messages of hope, courage, friendship, and love. It's a magical and touching experience that makes this film a good viewing especially with friends and family.",4,A Magical and Touching Family Film!,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,1454,"['Dust', 'Factory', 'story', 'hope', 'spiritual', 'recovery', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'traumatized', 'boy', 'named', 'Ryan', 'Ryan', 'Kelley', 'Ever', 'witnessing', 'train', 'ran', 'father', 'age', 'nine', 'had', 'became', 'mute', 'internally', 'depressed', 'One', 'day', 'rollerblading', 'old', 'bridge', 'fell', 'river', 'instantly', 'put', 'coma', 'mind', 'entered', 'imaginary', 'land', 'somewhere', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'met', 'Melanie', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'who', 'water', 'lake', 'trapped', 'dimension', 'became', 'friends', 'instantly', 'took', 'Dust', 'Factory', 'where', 'folks', 'would', 'make', 'leap', 'other', 'Dimensions', 'return', 'where', 'came', 'from.Later', 'Ryan', 'Melanie', 'ran', 'Grandpa', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'who', 'was', 'severely', 'afflicted', 'Alzheimers', 'was', 'process', 'making', 'transition', 'life', 'back', 'Heaven', 'was', 'dying', 'already', 'when', 'Ryan', 'was', 'coma', 'Grandpa', 'helped', 'Ryan', 'understand', 'importance', 'life', 'must', 'summon', 'courage', 'make', 'leap', 'can', 'return', 'mother', 'film', 'showcased', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'especially', 'loved', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'character', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'story', 'filled', 'messages', 'hope', 'courage', 'friendship', 'love', 'magical', 'touching', 'experience', 'film', 'good', 'viewing', 'especially', 'friends', 'family']",N/A
