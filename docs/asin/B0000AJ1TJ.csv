They love these DVDs.I like them because the absence of dialogue forces our children to figure out the storyline. I also like the fact that the humor is family-friendly and that I don't have to suffer through an hour of ""I wants"" after a Saturday morning cartoon fest chock full of commercials.If you have young children, this is a great buy.

I didnt expect to enjoy the cartoon that much. When I got them, I couldnt stop watching. amazing!!!

One is that if you're comparing it to many TV cartoons, it's not too bad - it's competently done, unlike most cartoons on TV today, which are disasters. The other is that, being a cartoon, it avoids the sometimes-risque humor of the real Mr. Bean shows.But beyond that there's nothing much here. Even my kids just sat and watched without laughing - and after a couple of episodes voted to skip the rest.

They got down his mannerisms, and he talks just like in the show (mostly noises and little words here and there). There's the mean old landlady downstairs with her mean old one eyed cat. And as usual, Mr. Bean and Teddy are always getting into trouble. My favorite episodes are his day of Spring Cleaning and him going on a Treasure Hunt. If you like watching Mr. Bean you will love these. I'm glad I got them, they are a great addition to the show.
