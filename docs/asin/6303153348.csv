A burglar (and a good one) forced into taking hostages in order to escape a slightly botched robbery, finds himself held hostage by his prey!  In his own words, &quot;I've kidnapped my parents!&quot;  This was also before Kevin Spacey was REALLY famous, too, so you know there's some good acting involved.  Not all around, I will admit, the son is a bit tenuous and immature.  Some of the characters a little dry, but that actually changes later in the movie.  The star, of course, is Denis.  Riding close behind him, though, are Spacey and Judy Davis, the bickering couple Leary is stuck with.Spacey and Davis play off each other beautifully in this film, as a couple in DESPERATE need of marriage counseling.  They have both lost sight of why they married in the first place, are stuck in life-ruts, and are considering a divorce.  Then, Leary steps in and the fur starts to fly.  I can't say too much without giving it away, but it's a witty and slightly warm movie about rediscovery and redemption.  After all, it is Christmastime!  Oh, and that element adds to the humor value, by the way.If you are a Leary fan, no question, just buy it.  If you are a comedy fan, same thing.  If you like Spacey, while his part isn't the biggest in the film, he really shines as usual, so again... buy it.  ;-)  I recommend it all around!

You will roar with laughter at the antics of this movie.Basic premise:  Gus is a burglar whose last big job gets botched and he ends up taking a couple hostage while the man hunt goes on to find him.  Unfortunately, he picked the worst couple possible to kidnap as even a gun in their faces won't stop them fighting.  Fortunately for them, Gus's really straight-forward attitude and blunt approach to their fighting actually breaks through this couple's problems and starts them to see what they're really fighting over.This is definitely a black humor kind of film and NOT really a family flick.  Think of it a bit like ""Bad Santa"" but not so vulgar, just a lot of swearing.But everyone you see in this flick is someone you probably know or are related to.  The couple that are struggling to keep their relationship afloat, the juvenile delinquent of a son, the brother with no spine, his hen-pecking wife, their two chubby kids that are yelled at constantly and best of all the absolute worst mother-in-law that is so inherently evil you root for her downfall when Denis takes her on.Got a dysfunctional family?

360593,A1YYBC3O7KHQKK,6303153348,Carter,"[3, 15]","Hard to believe the glowing amazon reviews.  The Ref is the story of a very dysfunctional family who say terribly mean things to one another.  And sadly, the film is about as fun as listening to that can be.  It fails on so many levels.  A home burglar decides the best way to evade the police is to kidnap a family, invade their home, and force them to host a scheduled Christmas dinner while he attends, wearing suit and tie, posing as a marriage counselor.  All of the film's subplots, the Scandinavian themed dinner, the drunk neighbor in a Santa suit, and the son's little black market side business to name a few, are pointless and add nothing to a story suffering the same problem.  I could go on about plot, but you wouldn't believe me if I did.  The rare humorous lines delivered capably by Glynis Jones as Spacey's mother can do nothing to save this mess.  What is so disappointing of course is that the film stars the usually outstanding Kevin Spacey, so the viewer begins with high expectations.  But don't expect shades of American Beauty here.  And The Ref is no War of the Roses either.  You hope for the funny, sarcastic, biting, and smart dialogue Spacey is famous for, but there is nothing remotely humorous or witty about the constant, non-stop jousting between Spacey and his estranged wife played by Judy Davis.  Likewise, by the time you've listened to Denis Leary's fifth or sixth forced and profanity laced emotional outburst, you're over them.  Good Morning America blurbs on the DVD case that the film is ""Hurt your sides funny!""  Well, The Ref is about as funny as two daily hours of network morning ""news"" programming, and equally mindless.  As for the amazon reviewer who writes the film is his new favorite holiday movie, that's like saying packaged fruit cake is your favorite Christmas food.  Writers Weiss and LaGravense must harbor deep personal resentments toward family and viciously unleash them on their characters.  It's not clear what else could explain the words they've put to paper.  I can't imagine folks wanting to watch something so dreary as this at Christmas or any other time.

His partner still can't figure out why they took ""Happy Days"" off the air.  Worst of all, he's managed to hijack his ""(expletive) parents,"" or the nearest thing.  The trouble is, it's Christmas Eve, not exactly a prime hostage taking time of the year.  But the local cops are out in full force trying to track him down.  Leaving the upper crust Connecticut town or the ""ninth level of Hell"" right away is too risky.Gus's hostages, Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur (Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis) have problems, too.  They have a rocky marriage and have difficulty coming to an agreement on such matters as to whether their son (Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.) is sensitive plant or a budding psychopath.  The only thing they agree on is that their therapist should shut up and let them fight.  You get the impression the therapist is considering doing just that.But fighting must take a back seat to figuring out how they can host the family Christmas while still technically being held hostage by Gus.  The family is currently fueling up at a diner (""Heaven knows what we'll get to eat at Aunt Caroline's.) but they're due soon enough.  Their son is also arriving home from military school, where he's been running a scam of his own.Surprisingly, the get-together is less than idyllic.

By the end of the evening, tears will be shed, feelings will be hurt, foreheads will narrowly avoid being singed, and several of the guests will themselves be wrapped up like holiday presents.  Also, a Christmas tree gets attacked, a put-upon police chief gets his revenge, and an intoxicated neighbor dressed as Santa, helps save the day.There are a few sweet moments where it looks possible that the characters might forgive all and hug, but the movie never descends into treacle.

And since the holidays just passed I decided it was time for another Christmas related review, this one here though is a film for every time of the year since it is so funny. Everything from the writing to the acting to the direction is pure perfection; this team should have come together more often and delivered more of these films. I remember the first time I had seen this was at my Aunt's house in Austin, I was visiting Texas at the time coming from Maryland and she popped it in. I had always liked Denis Leary so I knew I would enjoy this film, but I didn't expect to end up likening it so much that I went out and bought my own copy the next day.It is a simple of enough story in that it is all about a cat burglar [Leary] that is hiding out from the local police after a job goes bad, that is literally what the movie is about. What makes things all the more interesting is that he happens to end up hiding out with and taking hostage a married couple on the rocks that really seem to hate each other with a passion. And if that wasn't bad enough for him it just so happens to be Christmas so the entire family is coming over and they hate each other just as much as the couple. Add in a career criminal son who is on the way home from military school and you have all the makings of one of the funniest films to ever be produced.Denis Leary is absolutely perfect and in his element all through out this film as Gus, his wit and delivery for every line is incredible. This is probably the best film he has ever done or at the very least one of the best the man has been a part of. I was a fan of his from his stand up but this movie made me love the man's skills. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as Lloyd the underachieving momma's boy who is constantly at battle with his wife Caroline. Speaking of which, Judy Davis is just as good as his wife and holds her own with both of the lead actors with ease. She and Kevin going at it about her infidelities and him giving up everything are priceless, especially when they are driving the person who has them hostage crazy. If the film would have just had these three in it, it still would have been a classic in my eyes. These three make for one on the best on screen teams I have had the pleasure of seeing, they need to do more.The supporting cast is just as good and entertaining take Robert Steinmiller Jr. for instance who plays the couples son Jesse. Talk about a kid who would have been right at home with Macaulay Culkin on ""Home Alone"". The kid actually blackmails his drill instructor from military school before he goes home for Christmas; he gets a lot of cash. J. K. Simmons by the way was wonderful in that part as the instructor. Also top notch performances are given by Raymond J. Barry as the lead cop, [these are the rest of the family] Christine Baranski as Connie, Adam LeFevre as Gary, Phillip Nicoll as John, Ellie Raab as Mary, and by B.D. Wong as the marriage counselor. But Glynis Johns almost steals the show as the matriarch of the family; she is responsible for Gus delivering my favorite line of the film when she is being tied up. Richard Bright is excellent as well in this film as Murray; he is just as funny as the rest.Director Ted Demme keeps things going at a lively pace and things never seem to get boring or slow, in fact once it is over you are left wanting more because it was so good. Still all credit should not go to the director because the film was written by Marie Weiss and Richard LaGravenese and the delivered one hundred percent with this film. Their writing is quick and witty and full of comedy, what a great combination. Producers Don Simpson {R.I.P.} and Jerry Bruckheimer sure did know how to get the right comedies done together, The Ref, Bad Boys, and the first 2 Beverly Hill Cop films. The two really had a good eye for these types of films.Normally I would say when reviewing something that this might not be for everybody, but I happen to think that this time everyone could enjoy this film as much as I did. It has a wonderful cast and crew behind it who knew what they wanted and got the job done.

I had seen a little of  Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey at that time was just blossoming into a star.  Next to the Grinch trying to steal Christmas, this is the most uproarious  funny send up of Christmas I've ever seen, yet after watching it you still  feel good and miraculously it extends the good cheer. Leary plays a master  thief, who robs and then takes hostages, Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis, and  if he knew what trouble they would be, he would have run faster from them  than the police. These two yuppies take arguments to high art, with Leary  only barely having control because he has a gun, but that does not stop  their tirades. Add to this wild mix is the family coming over for dinner,  gourmet-cooked by Judy Davis, and they hate it. The great Glinnis Johns, as  Kevin Spacey's mother, is wonderful, as is all the supporting cast. Only a  super-animated character like Leary can keep up with this wildly funny,  fuming couple and try(barely) to sort things out. From start to finish, the  film rocks with verbal velocity, sight gags(the Swedish candle headpieces  were my favorite, with mother saying &quot;my head is getting hot,&quot;)  and a drunken neighborhood Santa turning quite Scrooge-like and whacky when  inebriated. The laughs never stop but like most movies there is a short  time to try to stop all this nonsense, draw some moral conclusions(after  all this is a Christmas movie-kind of) and find an ending. The ending isn't  very clear, for we have seen and heard so much. It would be difficult to  draw just one conclusion. Suffice it to say that The Ref is the funiest  movie I've watched in years. The acting is brilliant, and that other  Director Demme brother, Ted, has a great touch, keeping the sparks and  laughs flying at a furious pace.

His cynicism is so wonderfully dry and usually ignites its material, and The Ref is no exception.Spacey is in fact the highlight of this occasionally very funny and always very nasty little Xmas flick. He plays his character close to the chest at most points, avoiding the near-slapstick of some other actors here. Leary is better than usual, toning down his inherent meanness and doing his role justice in the meantime (but I will never love this guy, both for his complete ripoffs of so much of Bill Hicks' material and for his unbelievably mean comments at the end of his Comedy Central roast).The real highlight here is the script, in any case, and the cast can barely keep up with its endlessly scathing lines. The counseling scene at the start is truly excellent; sounds like the man and woman who wrote this have logged some hours in that room. The small town cop scenes also smell of writers' revenge, especially the exceptionally nasty riposte from the police chief at the end. Ouch. But the writing is invariably tight and everything moves along quickly and without too many dead moments.All in all, well worth watching, but not with the family and not with someone you're having relationship issues with; it might all hit a little too close to home.

360637,A1V8GY9ERC5T70,6303153348,Kyle R. Pierson,"[0, 0]","Judging by the DVD cover, you wouldn't expect this film to have any correlation to Christmas. However, like DIE HARD (but to a higher degree), Christmas is the backdrop for this hilarious film about a family kidnapped by an inept burglar. Denis Leary plays a jewel thief who, after a bungled burglary, is forced to take a feuding couple hostage in order to avoid the police. However, the couple (played to a ""T"" by Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis) prove to be too much for ""The Ref"" to handle. The title gets its name from the fact that Leary must continually resolve the differences between the constantly bickering family members. Once again, I believe this film could have packed a bigger punch at the box office had they only changed the title. Non-sports fans won't give a film with the title THE REF a second glance. Sports fans will be turned off once they read that the film isn't actually about a real REF. Then, the fact that there is no reference to Christmas on the cover, will keep people looking for unique holiday fare from picking up the box.The film continues to pick up steam as more and more of the family members - and a couple confused cops - show up at the house. No one gets along and THE REF has no where to turn. If you are the type of person who enjoys films like PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES where conflicting views can repeatedly prove comical, then THE REF is a surefire way to add a fun spark to your holiday movie collection.

Steinmiller, Jr. (The Ref, Rudy) who also learns a valuable lesson about his soon-to-be divorced parents.Dennis, Judy and Kevin are amazing on screen. They dry humor and black comedy about real important human issues makes this fun, educational and extreemly humorous.Coupled with the amazing performance of Chrstine Baranski (Happy Family, How The Grinch Stole Christams, The Birdcage) and the ever amazingly annoying mother-in-law played by Gylnis Johns (Marry Poppins, Superstar),This movie has performances that shine with every cast member.

This movie is similar in theme (the tables are turned on the kidnapper), although filled with some very funny one-liners (my favorite is a line about the need for a mute switch).  Dennis Leary is a Christmas Eve burglar in wealthy ""New Baybrook"" Connecticut, who sets off a boobie trap, alerting the police (who are totally inexperienced at dealing with serious crimes). They set up a roadblock so burglar Leary can't get out of town, so he kidnaps the wife of a fighting couple (Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis), who are driving home from a visit with their marriage counselor. He makes them take him home, although they are expecting Spacey's truly awful MIL and other relatives (including Christine Baranski) for dinner.  Their headed-down-the-wrong-track son is due home from the last-resort military academy he's attending.  But no wonder the son is so troubled -- his parents never stop bickering.  Burglar Leary ends up being a kind of marriage counselor to this rather affluent but deeply dysfunctional family.This is definitely a Christmas movie, but if you want cute little elves and jolly old Santa Claus, this isn't the movie for you.

Oh, yeah, before this review begins:  WHY ISN'T THIS ON DVD YET!!!!!?  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!?Now, back to the review.  This is a movie that is GUARANTEEDto make you laugh until it hurts and you are on the ground, laughing so hard that your crying.  This is also a very underated movie that should've gotten a lot more recognition.It's about a Christmas gone straight to hell.  Denis Leary plays a theif who is fleeing from the cops when a robbery has gone wrong.  He takes a couple hostage, hoping to hide out in their home and stay away from the police.  Well, he's about to find out that he's going to wish the cops had caught him, because the couple he has taken hostage are bitter, angry, and always yelling at each other.  Gun or no gun, this couple will fight and argue until Hell freezes over.  Leary does his best to try to calm things down, but he just might lose his sanity before the night is over.Denis Leary steals the show, spewing some of the funniest lines ever heard.  He is presented as the foul-mouthed, anger-filled comedian we all know and love.  Kevin Spacey is also very funny in this movie, and this was before he was famous.  The script is very original.  This is a holiday classic that should be on everyone's list.What are you waiting for?  A freaking invitation?  Go and see this movie already!  You won't regret it.  This has to be one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  An orignal work of art, if you ask me.  I can't wait for this to come out on DVD, but for now, I guess the VHS will just have to do.

The cynical sweetness of &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; is present here in small doses, but it gets stomped to pieces by bitter familial dysfunction.Kevin Spacey -- in my opinion the coolest actor working today -- gives a performance here that I rank as his best.  I know that others would point to the flashier roles of Verbal Kint (Usual Suspects) or Lester Burnham (American Beauty), but for me Lloyd Chasseur (pronounced with as much pretension as you can muster) is the be-all and the end-all of Kevin Spacey roles.  He is the ultimate put-upon husband/mama's boy, and his pathetic dreariness could not be any lower or any more real.Judy Davis -- who we don't get to see enough of these days -- is just great as the domineering wife, spoiled rotten by her upbringing and eternally disappointed with her failure of a husband.  Her rage and her ice-queen exterior are just diaphanous enough to cover her unhappiness.  She and Kevin manage to subtly hint that Caroline and Lloyd once loved each other, but now only loathe each other.  They make a great tandem.Denis Leary -- in the title role -- plays the middle ground between these two fine actors.  And he does superbly.  His Gus is a criminal and a loser, and he knows it.  Ripping off the Chasseurs is an opportunity to get out of cat burglary, and rid himself of his hapless partner Murray (a drunken Richard Bright).  Leary is a fine comic who very rarely shows much acting range, but here he shows us Gus' quick temper (quite easy, as that is also his comedian persona) but also his humanity and his morality (relatively speaking, of course).  If he had just relied on spitfire one liners and burning intensity, the whole movie would fall on top of him.  Many kudos to Leary for holding his own here.The rest of the cast is quite fine, sprinkled with competent and familiar faces.  They include Glynis Johns as the ultimate hard-assed matriarch, Christine Baranski as the plastic daughter-in-law, and a small but pivotal role for J.K. Simmons (one of my favourite character actors... he's Schillinger on TV's &quot;Oz&quot;) as the military school Commandant blackmailed by the Chasseur's ne'er-do-well son.The script is tight and witty, the setting is a hysterically insipid Christmas season in an affluent Connecticut suburb, and the story gets all the satirical moments just right.

He is a great actor, and he was very attractive in the ref, and his humor is unique and contagious. We all can relate to unpleasant holiday get togethers with the fam, and the mother in this movie, the grandma, is JUST LIKE my grandmother who i disowned and they act the same way and say the same rude and haneous things even at the dinner tables and during the holidays. AND my grandma also has money and uses it against everyone as a threat. So I and am sure many others can relate to this movie which happens to also be a comedy. Because we all know that guss is just another typical thief with no wife or kids, and obviously does have a heart and morals and he has to step in and referree this fighting family constantly while he hides from the cops and waits for his partner to get a getaway car, or in this case ends up being a boat. Kevin Spacey is another one of my favorite actors and he's also great in the ref. He plays the father who was cheated on by his wife with a devilery man. So it's pretty much non stop laughs and denis leary is hilarious and hot and a big turn on (for me) and if you like denis leary, check out JUDGMENT NIGHT, and his stand up comedy NO CURE FOR CANCER, which is also funny as hell, but judgement night is a thriller and learry plays the villain, and the cast and acting is great also and the cast includes emilio estevez.

He is waiting for a phone call from his partner and cannot leave until he gets it; meanwhile, the rest of the Chasseur family is due to arrive at any moment to celebrate the holiday.  What follows is probably some of the funniest dialogue in movie history, as the frankly loathsome mother-in-law (Leary tells her, ""I've met loan sharks more forgiving than you') and the rest of the family arrive and Leary has to pretend to be the couple's marriage therapist.This is a must-see movie, especially for the holidays.  Quick, witty dialogue and excellent performances make this a stand-out.  Although I found the subplot involving the son to be a little dull, the rest of the film more than makes up for it.
