1182401,A1XQVED2NX33TN,B001DOBH40,Catnip,"[3, 6]","While I enjoyed the first season and the second season just as much, the third was good, but after that it got ridiculous. Buell's grand standing and BEGGING for camera time, ACTING DRAMATICALLY, ppppffft to that!  Buell seems like a man who REALLY likes adulation and also seems to enjoy being the center of attention. I've since read other reports of fraud, fakery and just plain ol' lying in regards to the show. I do believe funky stuff happens that can't be explained, but to lie about it is just plain annoying and hurtful to the clients and those who believe they have a serious problem. Take the 'I am six' episode.  That came across as laughable. The chick, Laura, was SCREAMING for attention and pyschiatric care, and was destroying her family in the process. BUT, the family is just as much to blame as they were filling in the PS group saying they saw her being suspended in mid air and so on...um, ok. The chick seemed to have an almost smile' on her face while being interviewed.  Then theyw ent back for a second episode, more Buell grand standing trying to pick her up off the bed while yelling, ""let her go!!'. While being 'exorcised' she sounded not ferocious but waif like, and she almost looked like she was going to burst out laughing at times.  oops!  In the first one the family said she stopped breathing and it took them almost an hour to get her to breathe again...SHE'D BE DEAD!  Hello!  WAY over the top and unbelieveable.I ALSO found out that writing on skin is something you can easily do, AND there IS a medical condition called dermatologic urticaria.  Lay mens terms?  Skin writing.  I had a client who had that condition and you can actually write on the skin like a marker on a white board. Clear and crisp. It's a MEDICAL condition and they didn't even explore that avenue.Whether Chip Coffy is a legit psychic, many say NO that he's a professional actor and is completely briefed on ALL the information before coming into a case. Google I am six fraud and click on ghost theory for more on that.Lorraine Warren, sweet little old lady, famous for the Amityville horror case...um, I wouldn't toute that too loud. That case has been debunked time and time again and the Lutz's basically admitted they lied b/c of finances and to make a fast buck off the Defaeo murders. Sooooo.....I don't give much credibility to this show anymore. A fun ride if you wanna spook yourself out, but don't take everything too seriously....I believe there ARE things out there to explore, but I think PS is possibly full of BS.Just my opinion, you don't have to like it, comment on it or whatever.",2,"Fun ride, entertainment purposes only though",1238889600,"04 5, 2009",2009,2611,"['enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'third', 'was', 'good', 'got', 'ridiculous', 'Buell', 'grand', 'standing', 'BEGGING', 'camera', 'time', 'ACTING', 'DRAMATICALLY', 'ppppffft', 'Buell', 'man', 'who', 'REALLY', 'adulation', 'also', 'enjoy', 'being', 'center', 'attention', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reports', 'fraud', 'fakery', 'just', 'plain', 'ol', 'lying', 'regards', 'show', 'do', 'believe', 'funky', 'stuff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'lie', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'hurtful', 'clients', 'who', 'believe', 'have', 'serious', 'problem', 'Take', 'am', 'six', 'episode', 'came', 'laughable', 'chick', 'Laura', 'was', 'SCREAMING', 'attention', 'pyschiatric', 'care', 'was', 'destroying', 'family', 'process', 'BUT', 'family', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'blame', 'were', 'filling', 'PS', 'group', 'saying', 'saw', 'being', 'suspended', 'mid', 'air', 'so', 'um', 'ok', 'chick', 'seemed', 'have', 'almost', 'smile', 'face', 'being', 'interviewed', 'Then', 'theyw', 'ent', 'back', 'second', 'episode', 'more', 'Buell', 'grand', 'standing', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'bed', 'yelling', 'let', 'go', 'being', ""'exorcised"", 'sounded', 'not', 'ferocious', 'waif', 'almost', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'times', 'oops', 'first', 'one', 'family', 'said', 'stopped', 'breathing', 'took', 'almost', 'hour', 'get', 'breathe', 'again', 'SHE', ""'D"", 'BE', 'DEAD', 'Hello', 'WAY', 'top', 'unbelieveable.I', 'ALSO', 'found', 'out', 'writing', 'skin', 'something', 'can', 'easily', 'do', 'AND', 'medical', 'condition', 'called', 'dermatologic', 'urticaria', 'Lay', 'terms', 'Skin', 'writing', 'had', 'client', 'who', 'had', 'condition', 'can', 'actually', 'write', 'skin', 'marker', 'white', 'board', 'Clear', 'crisp', 'MEDICAL', 'condition', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'explore', 'avenue.Whether', 'Chip', 'Coffy', 'legit', 'psychic', 'many', 'say', 'NO', 'professional', 'actor', 'completely', 'briefed', 'information', 'coming', 'case', 'Google', 'am', 'six', 'fraud', 'click', 'ghost', 'theory', 'more', 'that.Lorraine', 'Warren', 'sweet', 'little', 'old', 'lady', 'famous', 'Amityville', 'horror', 'case', 'um', 'would', ""n't"", 'toute', 'too', 'loud', 'case', 'been', 'debunked', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Lutz', 'basically', 'admitted', 'lied', 'b/c', 'finances', 'make', 'fast', 'buck', 'Defaeo', 'murders', 'Sooooo', '..I', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'credibility', 'show', 'anymore', 'fun', 'ride', 'wan', 'na', 'spook', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'everything', 'too', 'seriously', '.I', 'believe', 'ARE', 'things', 'out', 'there', 'explore', 'think', 'PS', 'possibly', 'full', 'BS.Just', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'like', 'comment']",Paranormal State: Season 2

I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E;) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.""Paranormal State"" also leans a little bit too much, perhaps, on Catholicism, but I love the protection chant: ""The Light of God Surrounds Us. The Love of God Enfolds Us. The Power of God Protects Us."" It's a great mantra!!!Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one.
