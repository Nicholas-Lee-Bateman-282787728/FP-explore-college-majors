1329382,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0036X491O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[41, 41]","In the 2009 British miniseries ""The Take,"" actor Tom Hardy found the perfect role to announce that he was a major talent. While Hardy has been kicking around in various projects since 2001, he was largely known to the arthouse crowd for Nicolas Winding Refn's 2008 ""Bronson"" before his showy turn in ""Inception"" pushed him into a larger international spotlight. But for me, the quintessential star-making performance on Hardy's resume has got to be this chilling four part crime saga. Blending elements of gangster melodrama with domestic dysfunction, Hardy leads an exemplary cast in a familiar story of loyalty, betrayal, and retribution. I won't necessarily say that ""The Take"" is revelatory or even particularly unique in the realm of crime drama, but I will say that it is spectacularly entertaining! And credit must be given to Hardy and his co-stars for elevating what might have been a routine drama into something altogether riveting and unmissable. In case you can't tell, I loved ""The Take!""The series has an intimacy sometimes lacking from big crime epics as the action really centers on a handful of primary characters over the course of many years. Hardy and Shaun Evans play cousins whose respective partners also happen to be sisters. While not immediate family, per se, they are as close as any brothers. Adapted from Martina Cole's novel, the story (set in the eighties) follows the boys as they ascend to heights of power within the criminal underworld. Hardy is the charismatic and impetuous powder keg, while Evans is the more methodical partner. They are working for an imprisoned crime boss, played by the always reliable Brian Cox, but each has aspirations for something more. As you might imagine, as they progress in responsibility--their different styles start to lead them down different paths. I won't say any more, but in fairness, it's not hard to see where this gritty and deliciously unpleasant tale is headed. But the journey, while familiar, is definitely worth the ride.I can't say enough about the dynamic performance of Hardy. A chilling psychopath, he is also eminently likable. It's a stunning combination that's hard to pull off, but Hardy owns every scene that he's in (and is startlingly funny as well). Evans is solid in the straight man role. I suppose the story is just as much about his evolution as anything else, and it's a subtle and strong transition. But I don't want to underestimate the actresses who round out the principle quartet. Kierston Wareing is riveting as Hardy's unhinged wife, and Charlotte Riley is grounded and believable in the quieter role of Evans' spouse. With a different cast, I might have rated this story on an entirely different scale--but with these actors led by an unforgettable Hardy, I have to give this my highest recommendation. Hardy has already crossed over into the mainstream film industry, I hope that will raise awareness of some of his lesser known works. And ""The Take"" should definitely be on the top of your list if you're a fan.

I had heard great things about it and I had seen Bronson and RocknRolla. This is a brilliant miniseries, starring an ensemble cast that includes Tom Hardy (Inception, Bronson) and Brian Cox. The story line takes place over a decade when mob bosses went from old school to new. The lead character, Freddie, comes out of prison all set to resume his climb up the ladder when he discovers the new school is in charge. Freddie is a psychopath, but there are redeeming features to him. His sense of fair play is admirable but has lethal consequences. He is a ""might makes right"" kind of guy. His depth of anger at disloyalty is taken out not only on those who have cut him down but on those his betrayers love. He is at once a tender loving husband and father (he has two sons ... but can't say more) and a hurtful, neglectful abuser  There is so much to enjoy about this series, it's a shame I can't tell more without writing a SPOILER. The performances are electric, especially Hardy's. There is  violence, but it's not gratuitous.  This is not the Brit version of The Sopranos.
