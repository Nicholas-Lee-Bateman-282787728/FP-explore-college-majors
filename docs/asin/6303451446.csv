This was filmed shortly after the infamous freebasing fire nearly killed him in the early 1980s. Here, he talks frankly about that incident (the joke with the match is an amazing example of how he could find humor inhis darkest moments) and his need to quit drinking and dope. The tour de force here is the Africa routine. The cologne and body odor gag falls back on some un-PC stereotyping of Africans(of course, PC types aren't gonna watch this anyway), but his announced decision in this piece to never use the N-word again in comedy got a standing-o from me then and still makes me proud of him today. Sadly, this was his last truly great comedic work. From here on in, it would be unbearably bad movies and lackluster comedy like ""Here and Now"" before he succumbed to MS.

Unbelievably,one of the audience members was Rev. Jesse Jackson. Does Pryor mention the N-word? Of course,he does. Pryor,who followed in the footsteps back in the 1960's of another comedian three years his senior,Bill Cosby,influenced another trashmouthed comedian years later,Eddie Murphy. Both Pryor and Murphy influenced other trashmouthed black comedians such as Chris Rock and Dave Chapelle. Cosby himself,has always detested the use of profanity. Instead of the so-called profane words rhyming with ""luck"" and ""spit"",Cosby would instead say ""filth,foul,filth"". It may have happened to Pryor,Rock and Chapelle,but Cosby did once chastise Murphy on the phone for Murphy's obscene humor. I believe Cosby believes that profanity use is totally unnecessary. That's why Cosby's humor,as opposed to those of the others,is suitable for young children. In this concert,Pryor displays sexually-oriented humor as usual with the commonly spoken slang.

That is when I first saw it. Which is not to say that this is not a howlingly funny stand-up act most of the time.  It is that too.  Like most comics though, Pryor was not fueled by much good that had happened in his life, but rather by the things which had enraged him or enabled him to see the world with an all too cynical eye.  I liked him much better as this stand-up comedy performer than I ever did as an actor though.  He made so many lame comic films with Gene Wilder that I lost count of them.  If that is the only way you have seen him perform, in movies with Wilder, you really missed seeing his true talent. I think Pryor would have served himself better as a performer had he stayed in this  medium instead of becoming an actor. Some people may find Pryor offensive in stand-up but I think that is generally true of most stand-up comedy acts.

Richard Pryor is absolutely one of the funniest and most honest human beings who ever lived. As far as I'm concerned the only comedian who has even come close is Bernie Mac. But Bernie is tame compared to the full throttle antics of Pryor.Pryor approaches the show knowing the audience has read a lot about his troubled personal life so he comes out and point blank explains everything. From how he ran down the block after setting himself on fire accidentally, to his troubled marriage, to his trip to Africa and how it changed him.There's a lot of F-bombs (surprise) so you probably don't want to watch this movie in mixed company. If you're sensitive to &quot;white people are so funny&quot; routines then you should probably get a life. But if you wanna hear about how even the African hares intimidated Pryor (&quot;I ain't never seen a rabbit look at me like that before&quot;) or how the lions wanted to eat him and his camera, then this is a movie that will have you laughing so hysterically you'll probably pee in your pants.",4,So Funny You'll Need the Pause Button,1033516800,"10 2, 2002",2002,1157,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'friend', 'were', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'constantly', 'had', 'stop', 'film', 'just', 'recover', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'absolutely', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'honest', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'only', 'comedian', 'who', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Bernie', 'tame', 'compared', 'full', 'throttle', 'antics', 'Pryor.Pryor', 'show', 'knowing', 'audience', 'read', 'lot', 'troubled', 'personal', 'life', 'out', 'point', 'blank', 'explains', 'everything', 'how', 'ran', 'down', 'block', 'setting', 'fire', 'accidentally', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'trip', 'Africa', 'how', 'changed', 'lot', 'F-bombs', 'surprise', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'mixed', 'company', ""'re"", 'sensitive', 'quot', 'white', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'quot', 'routines', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'get', 'life', 'wan', 'na', 'hear', 'how', 'even', 'African', 'hares', 'intimidated', 'Pryor', 'quot', 'ai', ""n't"", 'never', 'seen', 'rabbit', 'look', 'quot', 'how', 'lions', 'wanted', 'eat', 'camera', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'so', 'hysterically', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'pee', 'pants']",Live on the Sunset Strip VHS

Now, i don't want to break the joke to you if not heard, but trust me its unbelievably hilarious, now each time when i see the Godfather, especially during that scene between Tessio and Tom, whilst everyone has a sombre expression on their faces in the room, i am the only laughing my head off thinking about Richard's joke.I would have to agree with an earlier reviewer that its not as funny as Live in Concert, but make no mistake, the momentum is definitely there. He handles his freebasing incident in a very humorous but in a redeemed manner.The consistency of jokes in this performance is extremely good and unlike Here and Now (in which the audience members are rude and boorish), this is a nice crowd and a very receptive audience, (known faces include a very young Jesse Jackson in the audience).He does Mudbone and his jokes about his trip to Africa and the epiphany he has there and his decision never to use the N word again, truly shows how much he has evolved as a performer and as a human being. He truly shows you his real self when he performs and that for me rates Richard Pryor as an honest comedian, with a big heart.",5,The Godfather segment gave me a stomach spasm.....,1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,1246,"['joke', 'Tessio', 'asking', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'pass', 'movie', 'Godfather', 'Tom', 'nodding', 'Now', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'break', 'joke', 'not', 'heard', 'unbelievably', 'hilarious', 'now', 'time', 'when', 'i', 'see', 'Godfather', 'especially', 'scene', 'Tessio', 'Tom', 'whilst', 'everyone', 'sombre', 'expression', 'room', 'i', 'am', 'only', 'laughing', 'head', 'thinking', 'Richard', 'joke.I', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Live', 'Concert', 'make', 'mistake', 'momentum', 'definitely', 'there', 'freebasing', 'incident', 'very', 'humorous', 'redeemed', 'manner.The', 'consistency', 'jokes', 'performance', 'extremely', 'good', 'Here', 'Now', 'audience', 'members', 'are', 'rude', 'boorish', 'nice', 'crowd', 'very', 'receptive', 'audience', 'known', 'include', 'very', 'young', 'Jesse', 'Jackson', 'audience', '.He', 'Mudbone', 'jokes', 'trip', 'Africa', 'epiphany', 'there', 'decision', 'never', 'use', 'N', 'word', 'again', 'truly', 'how', 'much', 'evolved', 'performer', 'human', 'being', 'truly', 'real', 'self', 'when', 'rates', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'honest', 'comedian', 'big', 'heart']",Live on the Sunset Strip VHS
