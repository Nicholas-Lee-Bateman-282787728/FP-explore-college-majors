The original series was 300m., but when Universal released it on VHS the cut it down below 120m. which took away a lot of the story's plot. It is very mysterious, but doesn't make much sense due to the harsh edits that have been made. The story is about a young couple Kate and Nick Constantine who move to a strange New England village, just to soon find themselves caught up in mysterious witchcraft rituals. Bette Davis plays the eerie Widow Fortune who has the towns people in her power.",3,"Universal, why, why?",1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,606,"['really', 'point', 'buying', '1978', 'TV', 'series', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'been', 'edited', 'way', 'much', 'original', 'series', 'was', '300m.', 'when', 'Universal', 'released', 'VHS', 'cut', 'down', '120m', 'took', 'away', 'lot', 'story', 'plot', 'very', 'mysterious', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'due', 'harsh', 'edits', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'story', 'young', 'couple', 'Kate', 'Nick', 'Constantine', 'who', 'move', 'strange', 'New', 'England', 'village', 'just', 'soon', 'find', 'caught', 'up', 'mysterious', 'witchcraft', 'rituals', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'eerie', 'Widow', 'Fortune', 'who', 'towns', 'people', 'power']",The Dark Secret of Harvest Home VHS

Yes this was a mini series, and I originally saw this when it aired on TV back in the late 70's.

Take a look at the number of people buying it, and see the price at which it sellers.  In my opinion, there were somethings that could have been edited out anyway.

I love this movie and I was wanting to get it on DVD... but it is not even listed.But, without a DVD version, I was contemplating getting a storemade VHS of this movie in the hopes of saving it to DVD and possibly finding lost scenes. I was just getting ready to order it when I read your warnings about the moving being chopped up. Apparently, they still don't get it. We buy factory versions of movies (DVD, VHS, etc) to obtain UNCUT versions of movies... NOT CUT-UP versions. They did the same to ""Hawaii"" on DVD... and the reviewers warned me on that one as well. I was fortunate to already have the full storebought VHS copy of that movie.I do have a full copy of Dark Secret of Harvest Home on VHS which I personally copied off of the TV over 15 years ago and it still plays like new. (Sony hi-grades were the only VHS blank tapes worth buying. I have some which were taped as far back as 1984 and still play great. I also took the liberty of buying 200 blank sony VHS tapes and 4 new spare VHS machines when it looked like they were going to phase these out for good... so I'm prepared for any eventuality. I am slowly trying to get DVD copies of all of my movies & series).Again... thanks for the warning.
