Still, it's suspenseful and has quite a few jumpy moments. Gruesome moments are less frequent, but are plentiful. Rachel Nichols (a woman once brought in to resurrect Alias) is perfect as a victim, but who isn't so helpless as to let fate and some creep take over her life. Wes Bentley makes a formidable bad guy.

1118668,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B000YDMIN0,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[2, 11]","I have been a fan of Wes Bentley since I saw him in the latest remake of ""The Four Feathers"" alongside Heath Ledger (tragically no longer with us). Since then his roles have been unremarkable, and here playing a demented night watchman turned stalker you have to wonder about his material choices. Having been mostly forgettable in Ghost Rider as Black Heart and the less said about The Ungodly (aka The Perfect Witness) last year, he seems determined to appear in movies many levels beneath his talents.All that said, P2 is a routine thriller with a few twists and scary ""jump"" moments along the way but no real tension.An office girl (Rachel Nichols) working late gets stuck in an underground parking garage and is pursued by Bentley who one assumes does not have inviting her for coffee on his mind.Although it's somewhat formulaic, there are some surprises that lift this out of mediocrity though. Nichols is not the standard dumb bimbo, and despite her situation makes some smart moves, and definitely gets the audience behind her. Bentley is convincing as the dissassociative psycho but unfortunately there are more than the usual number of highly questionable situations and happenings that stretch credibility and reduce the tension. The setting itself is cold, dark and concrete and makes for a chilling backdrop, the camera work for the most part is tight and despite the odd very dark scene or two, keeps your attention.Overall not a bad thriller, I just kept thinking ""yeah right"" too many times for it to be really gripping (or believable at all in places) and that spoiled it for me over all. Definitely worth a look, but probably to rent, not buy.",3,Wes Bentley needs a better agent.,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,1662,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'saw', 'latest', 'remake', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'alongside', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'tragically', 'no', 'longer', 'then', 'roles', 'have', 'been', 'unremarkable', 'here', 'playing', 'demented', 'night', 'watchman', 'turned', 'stalker', 'have', 'wonder', 'material', 'choices', 'Having', 'been', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Black', 'Heart', 'less', 'said', 'Ungodly', 'Perfect', 'Witness', 'last', 'year', 'determined', 'appear', 'movies', 'many', 'levels', 'talents.All', 'said', 'P2', 'routine', 'thriller', 'few', 'twists', 'scary', 'jump', 'moments', 'way', 'real', 'tension.An', 'office', 'girl', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'working', 'late', 'stuck', 'underground', 'parking', 'garage', 'pursued', 'Bentley', 'who', 'one', 'not', 'have', 'inviting', 'coffee', 'mind.Although', 'somewhat', 'formulaic', 'are', 'surprises', 'lift', 'out', 'mediocrity', 'Nichols', 'not', 'standard', 'dumb', 'bimbo', 'situation', 'smart', 'moves', 'definitely', 'audience', 'Bentley', 'convincing', 'dissassociative', 'psycho', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'more', 'usual', 'number', 'highly', 'questionable', 'situations', 'happenings', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'reduce', 'tension', 'setting', 'cold', 'dark', 'concrete', 'chilling', 'backdrop', 'camera', 'work', 'most', 'part', 'tight', 'odd', 'very', 'dark', 'scene', 'two', 'attention.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'thriller', 'just', 'kept', 'thinking', 'yeah', 'right', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'be', 'really', 'gripping', 'believable', 'places', 'spoiled', 'Definitely', 'look', 'probably', 'rent', 'not', 'buy']",P2 Theatrical Release
1118669,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B000YDMIN0,Andrew McCaffrey,"[1, 1]","P2 is a horror/thriller film set almost entirely in the second level of a below ground parking garage (hence the title).  The bulk of the action involves only two people.  When genre films don't have a large budget, they will often fall back on closed sets and small casts in an attempt to get a larger bang for their buck.  When this gamble doesn't pay off, you end up with a very static production and actors that you get sick of looking at.  But when it works, you can get a very tense thriller with genuine chills.  P2 exceeded my expectations and did very well with its material.Rachel Nichols plays a businesswoman stuck late at work on Christmas Eve.  When she is finally able to get away from her desk, she finds that her car has died in the lot.  After a violent encounter with the parking lot's night-watchman (Wes Bentley, AMERICAN BEAUTY), she wakes up chained to a chair in his office while he's matter-of-factly offering her a piping hot Christmas dinner straight from the workroom's microwave.For my money, the film takes a tiny bit too long to get to its premise. Yet once the action is set at ""cat versus mouse"" the movie really gets going and really gets good.  In many ways, the plot and story are very formulaic.  But they play the formula extremely well.  There aren't any huge cheats; the plot doesn't depend on the good girl doing incredibly stupid things or on the bad guy having superhuman abilities.  While some of the action is by necessity over the top, fundamentally this is a fairly realistic horror film.And the realism is where the movie's horror is at its best.  Dark, empty parking garages are scary to anyone who's been inside one.  Even more basic than that, in this day and age just being in a place where your cell-phone can't call anyone (like the police) can be an unnerving experience to those of us now mentally expecting to have instant communication.So while the writer and director wrung the maximum amount of fear possible from their location it was up to the two lead actors to convincingly convey the hunter and the hunted.  Rachel Nichols does a great job, and she was helped by the script which makes her character the victim but doesn't make her a fool.  Wes Bentley had something of a tougher time.  How do you authentically play the stereotypical horror film mass murderer who's clever enough to invent diabolical ways of killing and torturing, but mentally unstable enough to stoically go through with them?  What Bentley's character lacks in naturalness is more than made up for with pure horror movie creepiness.This is a good, tense, well-paced horror movie.  My only real complaint is that the ending seems a little abrupt with no real sense of closure.  But that's a minor point.  There's enough action to keep the horror fans happy, enough gore to keep the slasher fans happy and enough good old-fashioned psychological terror to keep happy the people who like a little more from their scary movies.  It's always been the case that a good, talented cast and crew can produce gold even with very little and this is one more example of that.",4,"""Everybody remember where we parked...""",1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,3099,"['P2', 'horror/thriller', 'film', 'set', 'almost', 'entirely', 'second', 'level', 'below', 'ground', 'parking', 'garage', 'hence', 'title', 'bulk', 'action', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'When', 'genre', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'large', 'budget', 'will', 'often', 'fall', 'back', 'closed', 'sets', 'small', 'casts', 'attempt', 'get', 'larger', 'bang', 'buck', 'When', 'gamble', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'end', 'up', 'very', 'static', 'production', 'actors', 'get', 'sick', 'looking', 'when', 'can', 'get', 'very', 'tense', 'thriller', 'genuine', 'chills', 'P2', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'material.Rachel', 'Nichols', 'businesswoman', 'stuck', 'late', 'work', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'When', 'finally', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'desk', 'car', 'died', 'lot', 'violent', 'encounter', 'parking', 'lot', 'night-watchman', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'up', 'chained', 'chair', 'office', 'matter-of-factly', 'offering', 'piping', 'hot', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'straight', 'workroom', 'microwave.For', 'money', 'film', 'tiny', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'premise', 'once', 'action', 'set', 'cat', 'versus', 'mouse', 'movie', 'really', 'going', 'really', 'good', 'many', 'ways', 'plot', 'story', 'are', 'very', 'formulaic', 'play', 'formula', 'extremely', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'huge', 'cheats', 'plot', ""n't"", 'depend', 'good', 'girl', 'doing', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'things', 'bad', 'guy', 'having', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'action', 'necessity', 'top', 'fundamentally', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'horror', 'film.And', 'realism', 'where', 'movie', 'horror', 'best', 'Dark', 'empty', 'parking', 'garages', 'are', 'scary', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'inside', 'one', 'Even', 'more', 'basic', 'day', 'age', 'just', 'being', 'place', 'where', 'cell-phone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'anyone', 'police', 'can', 'be', 'unnerving', 'experience', 'now', 'mentally', 'expecting', 'have', 'instant', 'communication.So', 'writer', 'director', 'wrung', 'maximum', 'amount', 'fear', 'possible', 'location', 'was', 'up', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'convincingly', 'convey', 'hunter', 'hunted', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'great', 'job', 'was', 'helped', 'script', 'character', 'victim', ""n't"", 'make', 'fool', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'had', 'something', 'tougher', 'time', 'How', 'do', 'authentically', 'play', 'stereotypical', 'horror', 'film', 'mass', 'murderer', 'who', 'clever', 'enough', 'invent', 'diabolical', 'ways', 'killing', 'torturing', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'enough', 'stoically', 'go', 'What', 'Bentley', 'character', 'naturalness', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'pure', 'horror', 'movie', 'creepiness.This', 'good', 'tense', 'well-paced', 'horror', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'ending', 'little', 'abrupt', 'real', 'sense', 'closure', 'minor', 'point', 'enough', 'action', 'keep', 'horror', 'fans', 'happy', 'enough', 'gore', 'keep', 'slasher', 'fans', 'happy', 'enough', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'psychological', 'terror', 'keep', 'happy', 'people', 'who', 'little', 'more', 'scary', 'movies', 'always', 'been', 'case', 'good', 'talented', 'cast', 'crew', 'can', 'produce', 'gold', 'even', 'very', 'little', 'one', 'more', 'example']",P2 Theatrical Release

1118673,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000YDMIN0,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Call me absolutely insane, but do you know what my favorite thing about P2 is?  It's the camera angles.  Seriously!Most action flicks that dominate with nonstop action scenes are difficult to follow because the camera angles are constantly jerking around in a thousand different directions, so it's hard to see what's actually taking place most of the time.With P2, every single one of the camera shots is really fantastic and extremely easy to follow.  You have no idea how much I appreciate this.  Too many films are released these days with terrible camera work, which basically ruins the action scenes themselves from my perspective.  If you can't actually see what's going on, why bother showing it?Besides that, P2 is seriously one of the best movies I've seen in at least a month (hey, I've watched a LOT of film over the last month!)The storyline dealing with a woman who can't escape from a lower portion of a building because a psychotic maniac is trying to kill her is simply fantastic.  It works really well.By the way, is it just me or does the bad guy actually look a lot like a younger Peter Gabriel?  His character was terrific playing the bad guy.  He'd act like he really wants to be in a relationship with the female victim, but then turn around and kill other people in graphic ways forcing the female victim to take off running and hiding.The movie doesn't hold back with the graphic scenes either.  One of them in particular is REALLY gross.  Let's just say, it's a body-poppingly good time, so sit back!The scene showing an elevator filling up with water is priceless as well.  The woman thinks she's safe inside the elevator but... no she's not!Oh, and that poor doggie!  His adventure doesn't end on a happy note to put it mildly.I just love films like these- a bad guy constantly chasing after innocent victims as they do everything in their power to avoid being killed by the maniac.

1118676,A14JBDSWKPKTZA,B000YDMIN0,"Bob Feeser ""MillCrafters.com""","[1, 1]","Our main character Angela Bridges (Rachel Nichols) is working overtime in a large downtown office complex. It is Christmas eve, so the building is all but vacant, except for Thomas (Wes Bentley) the lone security guard. She goes down to P2, which stands for parking level 2, and after getting a jump start by our now polite security guard, her car still fails to start. She hails a cab, but when it arrives, the front exit door to the lobby, mysteriously won't open.She returns to P2 to get some assistance, but no one is to be found. Then the lights go off, and she attempts to probe around in the dark, using only the light from her cell phones keypad. She trips over a curb, and when attempting to get up, she is attacked from behind by the security guard, and suffocated with a towel treated with chloroform, so she passes out. She wakes up sitting at a table with a low cut dress on that she is practically falling out of. Her natural beauty, and ample curves, blended together with the fact that he changed her while she was passed out, adds to the tension and intrigue as to how it is going to turn out.She awakes chained to a chair in the security office, the security guard is offering her Christmas dinner. It's all downhill from there. A fellow office worker who had mildly assaulted her, in an elevator, as a physical come on, after an office party, had come into her office, earlier during the day, and apologized for his drunken behavior, and she graciously accepted. The security guard had caught it all on tape. The security guard reveals his psycho-sexual dementia, by taking a handcuffed Angela for a ride in his car, to the lower level. There they find in a lone bay area, the office worker who had assaulted Angela, duct taped to an office chair. As an act of vengeance against Angela's assaulter, the security guard takes it on himself to be judge and executioner. Blood, guts, and gore are expressing it mildly.I can't describe any more of the scenes, so as to not ruin the movie, or give away how it turns out. What I mentioned so far is just the build up and the beginning. Using words to describe the experience is suspense, fear, intrigue, and a healthy dose of violence thrown in.

There is not much depth to the characters.What really impressed me was how simplistic the story is - and I mean that as a compliment. I'm pleased that the director did not bring in a B-story to augment this movie. Over-complicating this movie would have negatively impacted the end result. The story is kept to one location lasting a few hours. The pacing - especially in the first 30 minutes - could have been improved but the last 45 minutes does not disappoint.The acting was top-notch. Rachel Nichols really runs the gamut of emotions throughout this film.  She nails the nuances that makes her character believable - the facial expressions, the pauses in dialogue, the quivering voice all enhanced the movie.Wes Bentley was amazing. He was every bit the delusional psychopath needed for this story. One second he was tender and caring and the next he was an out-of-control screamer....and he pulled it off without being silly.So - good acting, simple story, small cast.

1118681,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000YDMIN0,Chris Kennison,"[0, 0]","When all was said and done, P2 turned out to be a pretty nicely shot, tightly packed little thriller. Apart from some routine little moments, P2 managages to keep you locked in and actually manages to get its story across with a fair amount of realism, never really being over-the-top, with the exception of Wes Bentley.My only REAL criticism of the movie was that Wes Bentley, who plays Thomas, the night security guard at a multi-level parking garage, played his role WAY over the top. I almost think that his character would have been more frightening had he been relatively normal, with brief moments of iratic behavior. Instead, the creators, and/or Bentley decided to play him as looney as a seventeen dollar bill.Otherwise I found P2 completely engrossing, the tension was well developed and some of the punch, counter punches going on were pretty original and realistic.I've long been waiting for Rachel Nichols to get a shot at doing something with a little more screen exposure so that we can see what she's truley capable of. P2 was a step in the right direction. Yet, if you haven't seen Rachel Nichols before, she's incredible beautiful and even though we finally get to see her display some of her acting chops, I'd kind of like to see her do something where she isn't covered in water, blood, car oil and dirt.Anyway, P2 is well worth the visit.

Her calls to her family indicate that she's worked late and missed what plans they had made before in the past. As Angela finally calls it a night and makes it down to the second level of the parking garage where her car is parked, she finds out that it won't start. Angela stumbles upon a security guard, Tom, and he's the only remaining person besides her in the building. Tom seems like a nice guy who's just trying to help, but he doesn't want to be alone this Christmas. Not again. Tom's true intentions are revealed after the lights in the parking garage go out and he gets his hands on Angela.Tom is extremely well-mannered and polite for a psychopathic killer. I mean, unless you say his name too many times or mess with his dog, Rocky. He's pretty much had his eye on Angela for a long time as he knows the names of her family members and knows what Bob, a fellow co-worker, did to her in the elevator during the office Christmas party. Bob doesn't get out of it unscathed though. I don't think anyone will look at office chairs the same again after this film. Tom is basically sick of being alone and will do anything he can to keep Angela there with him.The best part of the film has to be the fact that Angela isn't some helpless woman that doesn't do anything but cry after she's kidnapped. She actually makes some pretty legit decisions in the midst of the pandemonium happening around her. She even manages to hold her own against a dog, which can't be said for many other horror movies out there. She still breaks down, but it's really only after she makes a smart move, fails, and the reality of the situation sinks in.P2 is definitely worth watching. The film is a bit slow paced though. It's the type of film that builds and the payoff is rather satisfying. It's a relief to see a horror film with a female lead who isn't stupid, makes some logical decisions, and actually fights back against the psychopath stocking her. The definitive scene of this movie is the scene with the car and an office chair. It's the scene everyone will be talking about after viewing this film and for a good reason. So be sure to check this out if you're sick of the same, run of the mill horror flicks with women who do nothing but run away, scream, are stupid, have sex, or a combination of all four.I give this film a 7/10.",4,Better Than Expected,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,2411,"['Angela', 'borderline', 'workaholic', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'up', 'working', 'late', 'calls', 'family', 'indicate', 'worked', 'late', 'missed', 'what', 'had', 'made', 'past', 'Angela', 'finally', 'night', 'down', 'second', 'level', 'parking', 'garage', 'where', 'car', 'parked', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'Angela', 'security', 'guard', 'Tom', 'only', 'remaining', 'person', 'building', 'Tom', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'help', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'alone', 'Christmas', 'Not', 'again', 'Tom', 'true', 'intentions', 'are', 'revealed', 'lights', 'parking', 'garage', 'go', 'out', 'hands', 'Angela.Tom', 'extremely', 'well-mannered', 'polite', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'mean', 'say', 'name', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'mess', 'dog', 'Rocky', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'eye', 'Angela', 'long', 'time', 'names', 'family', 'members', 'what', 'Bob', 'fellow', 'co-worker', 'did', 'her', 'elevator', 'office', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Bob', ""n't"", 'get', 'unscathed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'will', 'look', 'office', 'chairs', 'same', 'again', 'film', 'Tom', 'basically', 'sick', 'being', 'alone', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'keep', 'Angela', 'him.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'be', 'fact', 'Angela', ""n't"", 'helpless', 'woman', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'cry', 'kidnapped', 'actually', 'pretty', 'legit', 'decisions', 'midst', 'pandemonium', 'happening', 'even', 'hold', 'own', 'dog', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'many', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'still', 'down', 'really', 'only', 'smart', 'move', 'reality', 'situation', 'sinks', 'in.P2', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'bit', 'slow', 'paced', 'type', 'film', 'builds', 'payoff', 'rather', 'satisfying', 'relief', 'see', 'horror', 'film', 'female', 'lead', 'who', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'logical', 'decisions', 'actually', 'fights', 'back', 'psychopath', 'stocking', 'definitive', 'scene', 'movie', 'scene', 'car', 'office', 'chair', 'scene', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'viewing', 'film', 'good', 'reason', 'So', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', ""'re"", 'sick', 'same', 'run', 'mill', 'horror', 'flicks', 'women', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'run', 'away', 'scream', 'are', 'stupid', 'have', 'sex', 'combination', 'four.I', 'give', 'film', '7/10']",P2 Theatrical Release
1118685,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B000YDMIN0,D. Allen,"[2, 3]","P2 is a special movie. I say special because the movie really doesn't have a clear enemy or hero (in this case heroine). The reason I say this is because from the start, Angela is the usual businesswoman: overworked, self-centered, ignores others that don't directly affect her, don't really care about her family enough, and seems to be outright rude to other people. Then we have Thomas an isolated disturbed young man who probably was ignored by everyone but wants to have a friend but somewhere along the line a nut fell lose in his head. Then we have the location of the movie: a locked parking garage in a cold city on Christmas Eve on floor two (P2, the name of the film). In many ways parking garages means everything bad or good in our world: coldness, isolation, and finally death.The movie sort of plays with your head. It's like one minute you're rooting for Thomas, then the next, Angela. I sort of felt bad for Thomas in some parts, then in others I hated his guts. With Angela, I sort of understood her position: I mean the business world is tough and sometimes you just ignore other people or be rude not because you are a bad person but because you just have so much going on in your plate.Overall, I liked the movie. To me I really didn't know who was the winner at the end. Perhaps this movie is about our life in the current business world. Maybe we're forgetting the little guys, or the little things that make us people. Check out the film though.

Not too much of a surprise, but I assume it probably had to do more with the lame title than the actual product.The screenplay was written by Franck Khalfoun, Alexandre Aja & Gregory Levasseur; and due to Aja and Levasseur being involved is what got my interest. I liked Haute Tension a lot and I thought the remake of The Hills Have Eyes was rather solid, but P2 doesn't work quite as well. The screenplay wasn't bad it was just too clich&eacute;d. We've seen this done so many times already. While the concept was interesting the execution was slightly off for the most part.Franck Khalfoun makes his directorial debut and delivers an uneven movie for the most part. P2 is more of a suspense/thriller with the elements of a horror film and the suspense and tension are lacking in most areas. There are some strong moments, but for the most part the suspense is just lacking. The parking garage does make for an eerie setting, but again the suspense and tension just lack for the most part. But Franck Khalfoun does manage to get some fairly creepy moments and for his debut it wasn't so bad. The pacing is overall pretty good and despite the flaws I can't say I was ever really bored.There aren't many kill scenes at all, but when there is one I have to say it's rather gruesome. One guy has his insides come out and there is a stabbing in the eye. But a couple of cool gore scenes really can't salvage a movie like this. A splatter flick can be saved by that, but not a movie like P2. Like I said Franck Khalfoun delivers a mixed bag; it was his first feature so I'll cut him some slack, but the suspense mostly lacks, but he does show some potential. I think Alexandre Aja might have been better suited to direct, but with Aja it seems if it isn't a remake he isn't interested.Rachel Nichols delivers a strong performance as Angela and I quite liked her character, and male viewers will always be interested when she's on camera due to her assets if you catch my drift. Wes Bentley also gives a strong performance, but rather than being creepy he just comes across as a bit goofy.P2 isn't a terrible movie it's just average at best and never reaches its full potential. It's one of those movies that is just sort of forgettable. Minutes after it ends you'll be hard pressed to remember most of the details. Nothing really stands out and it's a movie you've seen done many times.

1118689,A31A9GENAJYD64,B000YDMIN0,David M. Rossi,"[2, 2]","P-2 is without a doubt one of the greatest thrillers you've never seen. While it reeks of seen it before several times mentality, P-2 provides an incredible sense of dread and suspense that is rare in a movie of its' caliber. Our main characters Rachel Nichols and Wes Bentley create a film that is both believable and scary beyond belief. The film avoids the pitfalls of countless other creep-fests such as the lady in distress walking down dark corridors aimlessly shouting ""hello?"". Instead, Nichols' character makes logical choices and decisions that ultimately are the right ones in every situation she is forced to endure. Wes Bentley effectively exudes pathological charm bordering on excessive and and insanity teetering on over the top, yet never going too far over the edge (except one scene). There is a crush-a-guy-against-the-wall-with-a-moving-vehicle scene that we've seen done farcically in Bad Dreams and Creepshow 2's hitchhiker storyline, but in P-2 it is startlingly realistic and is a shocking view on the dangerousness of Wes's character Thomas's mind. His belief that he is helping Rachel's Angela by ridding the world of a touchy feely married jerk who at work gropes women he cant ever have is frightening at the outset and terrifying in the extreme. P-2 works best though when Rachel Nichol's gives her character Angela resolve to overcome everything that Wes's Thomas can throw her way. P-2's premise feeds off many people's existing fear of dark parking garages and being locked into a place with no escape after hours; a far more plausible scenario than a kidnapper taking his prey into an underground fortress as seen in the film Captivity. The only flaw is in the movie's slightly over-done climactic scene. However, with P-2 providing such a realistic take on psycho stalker films, walking to work seems to be a better idea now more than ever before. 4.75 stars",4,A blue Christmas indeed....,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,1893,"['P-2', 'doubt', 'one', 'greatest', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'mentality', 'P-2', 'incredible', 'sense', 'dread', 'suspense', 'rare', 'movie', 'caliber', 'main', 'characters', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'create', 'film', 'believable', 'scary', 'belief', 'film', 'pitfalls', 'countless', 'other', 'creep-fests', 'such', 'lady', 'distress', 'walking', 'down', 'dark', 'corridors', 'aimlessly', 'shouting', 'hello', 'Instead', 'Nichols', 'character', 'logical', 'choices', 'decisions', 'ultimately', 'are', 'right', 'ones', 'situation', 'forced', 'endure', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'effectively', 'pathological', 'charm', 'bordering', 'excessive', 'insanity', 'teetering', 'top', 'yet', 'never', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'edge', 'one', 'scene', 'crush-a-guy-against-the-wall-with-a-moving-vehicle', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'farcically', 'Bad', 'Dreams', 'Creepshow', '2', 'hitchhiker', 'storyline', 'P-2', 'startlingly', 'realistic', 'shocking', 'view', 'dangerousness', 'Wes', 'character', 'Thomas', 'mind', 'belief', 'helping', 'Rachel', 'Angela', 'ridding', 'world', 'touchy', 'feely', 'married', 'jerk', 'who', 'work', 'gropes', 'women', 'cant', 'ever', 'have', 'frightening', 'outset', 'terrifying', 'extreme', 'P-2', 'works', 'best', 'when', 'Rachel', 'Nichol', 'character', 'Angela', 'resolve', 'overcome', 'everything', 'Wes', 'Thomas', 'can', 'throw', 'way', 'P-2', 'premise', 'off', 'many', 'people', 'existing', 'fear', 'dark', 'parking', 'garages', 'being', 'locked', 'place', 'escape', 'hours', 'far', 'more', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'kidnapper', 'taking', 'prey', 'underground', 'fortress', 'seen', 'film', 'Captivity', 'only', 'flaw', 'movie', 'slightly', 'over-done', 'climactic', 'scene', 'However', 'P-2', 'providing', 'such', 'realistic', 'take', 'psycho', 'stalker', 'films', 'walking', 'work', 'be', 'better', 'idea', 'now', 'more', 'ever', '4.75', 'stars']",P2 Theatrical Release

That it would be hard pressed to keep me interested.  But i was wrong as the characters Rachel Nichols and Wes Bentley play are more than interesting enough.Its not everyday that you get a movie based entirely in a parking lot (P2).  As her character plays a hard working person that's working late on yet another project and she's on her way out to have Christmas with her family.  But her car doesnt start and she has to go ask for help, enter Wes Bently who's security guard character ""tries"" to help her get it started.  When that doesnt work, he offers her a chance to have dinner with him (then he jokes) like he was kidding.  She of course turns him down.  She gets a cab to come pick her up but when trying to leave the doors are all locked.This is where things basically take off and she's kidnapped by the security guard and ""chained to a table"" for a wonderful Christmas dinner that she wants no part of.  She escapes and goes from there, lots of chasing, killing of a few unfortunate people.It works because it is believable that something like this could happen to someone in a parking lot at anytime.  It makes you think again about that noise that you heard or staying late and not having someone with you when you leave late at night.  Thats what it does for me and kept me thinking not unpredictable by any means.But P2 manages to keep me interested and excited hoping that ""the psycho, cracked out and demented"" security guard gets a Christmas gift of his own.  :)",4,it works,1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,1555,"['i', 'figured', 'movie', 'only', 'had', '2', 'characters', 'featured', 'ones', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'keep', 'interested', 'i', 'was', 'wrong', 'characters', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'play', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'enough.Its', 'not', 'everyday', 'get', 'movie', 'based', 'entirely', 'parking', 'lot', 'P2', 'character', 'hard', 'working', 'person', 'working', 'late', 'yet', 'project', 'way', 'have', 'Christmas', 'family', 'car', 'doesnt', 'start', 'go', 'ask', 'help', 'enter', 'Wes', 'Bently', 'who', 'security', 'guard', 'character', 'tries', 'help', 'get', 'started', 'When', 'doesnt', 'work', 'chance', 'have', 'dinner', 'then', 'was', 'kidding', 'course', 'down', 'cab', 'come', 'pick', 'up', 'when', 'trying', 'leave', 'doors', 'are', 'locked.This', 'where', 'things', 'basically', 'take', 'off', 'kidnapped', 'security', 'guard', 'chained', 'table', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'part', 'there', 'lots', 'chasing', 'killing', 'few', 'unfortunate', 'people.It', 'believable', 'something', 'could', 'happen', 'someone', 'parking', 'lot', 'anytime', 'think', 'again', 'noise', 'heard', 'staying', 'late', 'not', 'having', 'someone', 'when', 'leave', 'late', 'night', 'what', 'kept', 'thinking', 'not', 'unpredictable', 'means.But', 'P2', 'keep', 'interested', 'excited', 'hoping', 'psycho', 'cracked', 'out', 'demented', 'security', 'guard', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'own']",P2 Theatrical Release

All the action takes place in the lower basement parking levels of a Manhattan high rise.  As our female lead, Angela Bridges, attempts to simply leave work and drive to her sister's house for Christmas Eve, she quickly realizes that this task will become the hardest of her life.  She's met by the lonely, psychotic night security guard, who has Christmas Eve plans of his own, and unbeknownst to Angela, they perversely involve her.While I know the budget may have prevented it, the story would have benefitted by some chases within the office building itself, but the action remains primarily in the lower parking levels, the elevator, and the security office.  It's still one thrilling sequence after another, that is, once the first, more dramatic 45 minutes have elapsed.  Those early scenes tend to drag on too long, without enough interesting dialogue to keep them so extended.  However, it's definitely nothing to hit the fast forward button about, as the leads pull of two great performances, which keep you interested and watching, even during the slow build-ups.The cat vs. mouse game is played out here very well, with chase after chase, both on foot, in an elevator shaft, and also one pitting car vs. car.  It's also high on gore content, for those not too squeamish.  Some, may be put off by the rather high level of displayed violence and gore.  The cinematography is suprisingly good for such claustrophobic spaces, and both the DVD widescreen transfer and the film itself are remarkably crisp.  There are 3 featurettes ranging from 3 to 12 minutes.Overall, an enjoyable ride through realm of a psycho chasing the girl victim.

He has a warped sense of both reality & morality, and this does not bode well for our damsel in distress.Nichols and Bentley both turn in fine performances, which is an especially good thing in this movie as there are scarcely any other characters in the whole film.  We have empathy for Nichols as the workaholic who is thrown into a nightmare without end, and Bentley is way spooky as the psycho security guard.  He does a great job of going back & forth from calm, cool & collected to having violent, agitated outbursts.  On the downside, after portraying such a mentally unbalanced misogynistic creep, Bentley may have great difficulty ever finding a date for the rest of his life.  But that, of course, is beside the point!If you're looking for a good psychological thriller, this one is certainly worth a look.

Then, the creativity of the writer and producer became more evident. Wes Bentley, who plays Thomas the security guard, turns out to have tremendous acting ability, with a wide range of obvious and subtle emotional expressions, all of them fully displayed for the camera in this film. He is  surprisingly compassionate sounding at times, almost convincingly so, and then explodes into unexpected rage on the slightest provocation. He has a hidden emotional depth that is very sinister and threatening, despite his handsome face and reassuring manner. The film turns into one of those spine-tingling, teeth-gritting, edge-of-your-seat psychological and physical struggles for survival. This is a predator versus prey stalking film. It has action, horror, and bloody gore - enough to satisfy the most jaded viewer.Angela Bridges plays a vulnerable and beautiful lawyer who works late on Christmas Eve and plans to attend a Christmas Eve party at her mom's house, where her sister and neice would be waiting. She is forced to make a phone call, giving them the excuse that she is not feelling well and has the flu. Little do they realize the peril in which Angela has inadvertently stepped. After this point in the film, the adrenaline rush hits and keeps coming in waves, as new developments in the plot prove that Angela is a formidable enemy, a fighter in the most literal sense of the word. She engages in a life and death struggle in the parking garage against Thomas, the security guard.The film may have been low budget especially since there are not many actors, perhaps five in all. However, the camera is used to  maximal effect: capturing darkness and light, the different levels in the parking garage, the columns, and even the elevator, despite minimal scenery, maximal fear is created. With few lights on, Angela approaches her car and unknown to her, she descends into her worst nightmare. The manner in which Thomas fantasizes a love relationship and date with Angela is well played out. When she thwarts his efforts and does not fall for this game all hell breaks loose. Thomas's need to control the situation which is obviously falling apart causes unexpected emotional outbursts. His fantasy and dreams unravel. Angela's survival mechanism kicks into overtime and Thomas is given a run for his money, one he did not expect ... This film is well recommended with the caveat for female viewers, make sure you are not alone when watching it.

1118706,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000YDMIN0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","This movie sure got some grief from the critics out there. Me, I liked it well enough to say: give it a chance. No, P2 doesn't break any new ground in the slasher/stalker flick genre. But P2 is serviceable enough and boasts several good nerve-jangling payoff moments, especially if you're a gorehound. Like all decent thrillers, P2 does evoke an ominous, creeping sensation, in particular, those heebie-jeebies felt when one is all alone, late at night, in a parking structure. I've felt it; you've felt it. And the film builds on it.The plot is stripped-down, yet, I think, effective in its simplicity. It is what it is: a career-driven woman toiling late on Christmas Eve who finds herself trapped in her firm's multi-leveled parking structure, and terrorized by a creepy, demented security guard. Oh, and there's a dangerous Rottweiler.This is basically a two-actor show, between Wes Bentley and Rachel Nichols as they go into their harrowing cat and mouse game. So much of the enjoyment of the film depends on the effectiveness of Bentley and the likability of Nichols. It's true that these two lead characters are underdeveloped, especially Thomas, the psychopathic security guard. But, given the film's genre, one only fleetingly wonders about this dude's psychological underpinnings. We pretty much accept that Thomas is lonely and loony and terribly fixated on Angela (I guess one clue to his looniness is that he's into Elvis), so roll the camera already. Here's the thing: Wes Bentley, to me, just doesn't click, coming off as too petulant at times, which undermines his ability to frighten us. There are times when an unassuming appearance can work well for contrast, but I don't think Bentley quite pulls it off. Still, he does enough to get you involved in Angela's predicament. What Thomas does to the drunken co-worker (who got frisky with Angela in an elevator) should validate his nutty and murderous nature. Plus, this gruesome scene is one serious highlight for the gorehounds.On the other hand, Rachel Nichols is pretty good, her transformation from harried workaholic to fear-wracked victim to determined and vengeful-minded survivor follows a fairly believable arc. I wish though that Angela's character had been fleshed out more, to draw out an even deeper sympathetic reaction. What we learn of her, we learn in quick strokes. From the moment we see Angela in her high-rise office, we recognize her as supremely dedicated to her corporate work and perhaps a bit icy in personality. She does have a family about whom she cares deeply. We know she's just regular folks (a farm girl, in fact), because the other, older security guard, who hails from working class roots, is friends with her. This last one allows us to begin rooting for Angela and to feel uneasy for her as her car refuses to start in the shadowy car park. And, wouldn't you know it, in these subterranean levels, cell phones are simply useless. Then comes Thomas, the parking garage security, who soon begins to act just a bit off. His peevish comment of ""I was just trying to help."" fair screams a warning.I do like that Angela is intelligent enough to not fall into the usual traps and pitfalls found in a horror/slasher flick. She doesn't do anything too wrong or stupid, to make the audience groan. Her actions are logical and even clever and bold. One thing she does upon effecting an escape is to head directly to Thomas's office to procure his card keys (but, of course, these don't open anything). Later, she gets hold of an axe and systematically takes out the surveillance cameras.Okay, one amazingly stupid thing she does: with a homicidal dog in manic pursuit, she shatters a car window and climbs in, perhaps thinking that dogs aren't capable of leaping into car windows...Rachel Nichols is very good at portraying fear and gumption, desperation and resolve. Her Angela is cut from the same mold as the recent heroines ofRed Eye (Widescreen Edition)andHigh Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition), and, like them, she's put thru some serious, serious hell. But then pluck and survival mechanisms kick in. Angela begins to fight back, and the cat and mouse games suddenly become more two sided.The devices used to elicit ""Eeks!"" from the audience are formulaic, but that doesn't mean they don't work. P2 excels in its claustrophobic atmosphere, making you peer twice into each shadowy corner. The best parts of the movie happen during the suspenseful hide-and-seek moments. But these are interspersed with slow sequences of Thomas engaging in nerdy, weird conversations (read: meltdowns) with Angela, these last scenes making me want to fast forward the film. So, is P2 a top notch scarefest? No. The talent assembled are okay, especially Nichols. I don't think there's anything here which we as horror fans haven't seen before, and better executed. Nevertheless, come in here, and with no expectations. Watch this in the dark some evening. And then try not to think of this film when you're stuck late one night in some parking structure.",3,"""Way to ruin Christmas...""",1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,5037,"['movie', 'sure', 'got',

It leaked out and is worth it for the few of you that both like Horror movies and collect HD DVD's. Basically, the story of a woman stalked through a parking structure of her workplace by the security guard on Christmas Eve. It lends itself to some crazy moments in the movie and it was easily very underated as a film as the storyline is well written as the acting was very well done. One of the best things about the film is that most of the stuff that happens is very believable to boot.

1118708,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000YDMIN0,Jason,"[1, 1]","As usual, Angela (Rachel Nichols) is working late.  It's the Christmas season and she's one of the last people to leave.  All she wants to do is get in her car, parked in the P2 level of the parking garage, and meet her family for festivities.  As expected, her car won't start, and she solicits help from the building security guard Tom (played by that creepy guy from American Beauty).  They have no luck with the car, and in no time at all, it's clear he has the building wired with more secret cameras and video surveillance than the Big Brother house.  What is it with this guy and bad video footage?As Angela walks aimlessly throughout the parking garage, the lights go out.  Queue the scary appearance of Tom out of nowhere, as he tries the old ""win her heart with a rag full of chloroform"" technique.  When she awakens, Tom has her in a fancy dress (read: tons of cleavage), chained to a table, and sitting in front of an impromptu Christmas dinner prepared via microwave.  Yummy!Interesting mind games ensue as Tom attempts to learn more about Angela as she slowly weaves a web of easily uncovered lies.  It becomes quite intense when it's evident that Tom has been keeping track of Angela for quite some time, quoting facts about her family, job, life, and the late hours she keeps.From there it's the classic cat and mouse game, as Tom chases Jerry, er, Angela throughout the building.  With intimate knowledge and access to the building, and absolutely no qualms about ruthlessly murdering someone, Tom has an overwhelming advantage over Angela - not to mention the fact that she's getting absolutely atrocious cell-phone reception from Nextel while in the parking garage.  Unfortunately, the movie never really gets out of the plot basement.Will Angela survive, or will she suffer from Stockholm Syndrome?  Will she show full frontal nudity?  Will she make ignorant horror movie decisions throughout her ordeal?  Will a rottweiler be portrayed as a ruthless killing machine?  Will she turn into a revenge-seeking pyromaniac with a nasty leg wound? Sadly, the answer to all but one of those questions was the exact opposite of my hopes, and despite the fact that I was left wanting when the credits rolled, somehow I still enjoyed the ride.",3,Yuletide terror in the garage,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,2252,"['usual', 'Angela', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'working', 'late', 'Christmas', 'season', 'one', 'last', 'people', 'leave', 'do', 'get', 'car', 'parked', 'P2', 'level', 'parking', 'garage', 'meet', 'family', 'festivities', 'expected', 'car', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'help', 'building', 'security', 'guard', 'Tom', 'played', 'creepy', 'guy', 'American', 'Beauty', 'have', 'luck', 'car', 'time', 'clear', 'building', 'wired', 'more', 'secret', 'cameras', 'video', 'surveillance', 'Big', 'Brother', 'house', 'What', 'guy', 'bad', 'video', 'footage', 'Angela', 'aimlessly', 'parking', 'garage', 'lights', 'go', 'out', 'Queue', 'scary', 'appearance', 'Tom', 'nowhere', 'old', 'win', 'heart', 'rag', 'full', 'chloroform', 'technique', 'When', 'Tom', 'fancy', 'dress', 'read', 'tons', 'cleavage', 'chained', 'table', 'sitting', 'front', 'impromptu', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'prepared', 'microwave', 'Yummy', 'Interesting', 'mind', 'games', 'ensue', 'Tom', 'learn', 'more', 'about', 'Angela', 'web', 'easily', 'uncovered', 'lies', 'quite', 'intense', 'when', 'evident', 'Tom', 'been', 'keeping', 'track', 'Angela', 'quite', 'time', 'quoting', 'facts', 'family', 'job', 'life', 'late', 'hours', 'classic', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'er', 'Angela', 'building', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'access', 'building', 'absolutely', 'qualms', 'ruthlessly', 'murdering', 'someone', 'Tom', 'overwhelming', 'advantage', 'Angela', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'getting', 'absolutely', 'atrocious', 'cell-phone', 'reception', 'Nextel', 'parking', 'garage', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'plot', 'basement.Will', 'Angela', 'survive', 'will', 'suffer', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'Will', 'show', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Will', 'make', 'ignorant', 'horror', 'movie', 'decisions', 'ordeal', 'Will', 'rottweiler', 'be', 'portrayed', 'ruthless', 'killing', 'machine', 'Will', 'turn', 'revenge-seeking', 'pyromaniac', 'nasty', 'leg', 'wound', 'Sadly', 'answer', 'one', 'questions', 'was', 'exact', 'opposite', 'hopes', 'fact', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'somehow', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'ride']",P2 Theatrical Release
1118709,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B000YDMIN0,J. B. Hoyos,"[2, 2]","""P2"" is good holiday slasher fare.  The plot is simple:  Angela (Rachel Nichols of ""The Woods"") is a beautiful, young workaholic who is the last employee to leave on Christmas Eve.  She goes to the second level (P2) of the skyscraper's underground parking garage.  Unable to start her car, she seeks assistance from the young security guard Tom [Wes Bentley of ""Soul Survivors (The Killer Cut)"" and ""American Beauty""] who holds her captive.  What makes this movie good is that it is very plausible.  How many women have been mugged in parking lots and thrown into the trunks of their cars?  How many women are stalked and killed by strangers?  It happens all the time.The acting is great.  Wes Bentley is convincing as the psychopathic killer who doesn't want to be alone on Christmas.  We watch mesmerized as Rachel Nichols is transformed from a helpless victim into a fighting machine.  We feel her character's pain as the police drive out of the parking garage with her running behind them, her screams unheard.""P2"" is a nightmare that many of us could easily be forced to live through if we don't pay close attention to who is watching us.  The gore is kept to a minimum.  The body count is low.  This movie is plot driven, and a suspenseful plot it is.  You keep praying that Angela will make it out of the building alive.  It's a shame we never learn more about Tom's background.  How exactly did he become a psychopathic murderer?  All we know is that he's been watching Angela drive in and out of the building for a long time.  He's also been watching her in the elevators.I will have to add ""P2"" to my collection of Christmas horror movies that includes ""Black Christmas"" (original and remake) and ""Silent Night, Deadly Night.""",4,This Could Easily Happen To You,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,1736,"['P2', 'good', 'holiday', 'fare', 'plot', 'simple', 'Angela', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Woods', 'beautiful', 'young', 'workaholic', 'who', 'last', 'employee', 'leave', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'second', 'level', 'P2', 'skyscraper', 'underground', 'parking', 'garage', 'Unable', 'start', 'car', 'assistance', 'young', 'security', 'guard', 'Tom', '[', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'Killer', 'Cut', 'American', 'Beauty', ']', 'who', 'captive', 'What', 'movie', 'good', 'very', 'plausible', 'How', 'many', 'women', 'have', 'been', 'mugged', 'parking', 'lots', 'thrown', 'trunks', 'cars', 'How', 'many', 'women', 'are', 'stalked', 'killed', 'strangers', 'time.The', 'acting', 'great', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'convincing', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'alone', 'Christmas', 'watch', 'mesmerized', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'transformed', 'helpless', 'victim', 'fighting', 'machine', 'feel', 'character', 'pain', 'police', 'drive', 'parking', 'garage', 'running', 'screams', 'unheard', 'P2', 'nightmare', 'many', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'forced', 'live', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'who', 'watching', 'gore', 'kept', 'minimum', 'body', 'count', 'low', 'movie', 'plot', 'driven', 'suspenseful', 'plot', 'keep', 'praying', 'Angela', 'will', 'make', 'building', 'alive', 'shame', 'never', 'learn', 'more', 'Tom', 'background', 'How', 'exactly', 'did', 'become', 'psychopathic', 'murderer', 'know', 'been', 'watching', 'Angela', 'drive', 'building', 'long', 'time', 'also', 'been', 'watching', 'elevators.I', 'will', 'have', 'add', 'P2', 'collection', 'Christmas', 'horror', 'movies', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'original', 'remake', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Deadly', 'Night']",P2 Theatrical Release
1118710,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B000YDMIN0,Jem,"[1, 8]","I watched this movie with my 18 year old niece.  She likes horror movies.  Or, more accurately I should say she likes to laugh at horror movies.  This movie didn't even get laughs.  It was almost 45 minutes into it before the action really started.  As soon as the girl gets to the car, viewers can guess the villain.  It's the cliche ""torture the girl who doesn't return my affections"" villain.  This movie is a chase scene.  An overly long chase scene, when the bad guy really should've been able to catch her.  Certainly we have to suspend our disbelief for a horror movie, but I expect some realism - like following the laws of gravity.  When she's stuck in the elevator and he tries to flood the car with water by turning on a hose from the floor above, I wondered why the heck the water didn't wash around the car into the shaft.  Oh, and when she calls 911 and THEY PUT HER ON HOLD, I actually yelled ""come on!"" at  my tv.  Naturally she keeps escaping, until the movie finally switches to a new cliche, ""let's kill the killer.""Horror movies aren't my cup of tea, I admit.  But, I gave it a try because I do like a good thriller.  There really wasn't anything good about this one, for me or her.

Put these three elements together and you have one chilling horror flick that is just a bit too real for comfort.Who among us has never felt that slight prickling of fear when you suddenly realize you are alone in a darkened garage - just enough trepidation to cause you to pick up your gait a bit as you hurry to the imagined safety of your car?Working late Christmas Eve, Angela rushes to her car as she tries to salvage what is left of a holiday evening with her family.  One thing after another happens, and poor Angela is stranded in a locked building, her only companion a slightly creepy parking attendant, Tom.But Tom is more than slightly creepy - he is a veritable lunatic, and he has set his sights on Angela.  Soon Angela's situation turns dire as she finds herself not only stranded, but in a battle for her very life as Tom gives full reign to his madness.Although she is used to being taken advantage of in her day-to-day life, both in business and her personal life, when the chips are down Angela is no one's victim, and she does whatever it takes to stay alive.While `P2' is fairly predictable in its plot, it doesn't lessen the effectiveness of it, not one whit.  You'll still jump in your seat at each new heinous act the villainous Tom commits.  Predictable it may be, but this is one undeniably entertaining film.What I liked best about `P2' is that there is some logic to the plot.  I cannot abide horror films that expect a suspension of disbelief without supporting the unbelievable aspects of the story, such as a killer who seemingly can't be killed.  Such is not the case with `P2'.  Every action, every reaction is grounded in reality.  I can imagine this actually occurring.  While Tom may be two steps ahead of Angela through most of the film, he is definitely not indestructible, and Angela soon turns the tide against him.Add to that a heroine who never once suffers from the `too-stupid-to-live' syndrome, but instead grabs hold of her destiny with both handcuffed hands and wrests her freedom from the man who would take both her liberty and her life, and you have my kind of movie.I have to say, having watched `P2', I am very grateful I don't have to park in a parking garage very often.

The idea is to play upon the fear and apprehension most of us seem to feel when we are alone in these bleak and remote places. The quality of every aspect of this movie is first class, from the acting to the writing.  There is just the right amount of gore to scare us without making the movie seem exploitative. What gore there is, is extremely effective and realistic. Perhaps, one of the scariest aspects of this movie is the realism and the fact that it could actually happen. Also supplied on this DVD are a few documentaries on the making of P2, as well as an informative and humorous commentary by the writer along with the director. Although the official rating of P2 is""R"", there is nothing really inappropriate for anyone to see or hear, other than the type of gore that is frequently seen in horror movies these days.

1118714,A2M8O1WZRXMRQ9,B000YDMIN0,Jose Jones,"[1, 1]","If you're going to make a low-budget thriller, you should really stay away from a horribly generic title like ""P2.""  The funniest thing I heard about the title was when someone wrote ""It's the first thriller about a PlayStation II controller.""I have a penchant for bad thrillers, but I watched this movie primarily to see Wes Bentley play a psycho (since I thought he was perfect for such a role).  As it turns out, this little parking-garage flick has quite a bit going for it.Rachel Nichols plays a workaholic New York businesswoman who's working late on Christmas Eve.  She's the last employee to leave the building that night and finds herself locked in the building's parking garage when her car won't start.  Enter friendly security guard Wes Bentley, who first tries to help, and then ties her up in his little office and tries to force a love connection.The movie has a terrific pace, never really letting up once Nichols is in peril.  It also includes some unexpectedly cool gore scenes, which are a plus in my book.  But the real success of the movie comes in the casting.  Nichols couldn't be more wholesome, with her snowy white skin and blonde hair, if she tried.  And Bentley is able to invoke full-blown insanity with a simple shift in facial expression.I really like the way Bentley's dark good looks play into the role -- you think to yourself if someone this handsome is so lonely and socially awkward, he must have some really intense issues going on.The director and his producer-writers do a credible job with the claustrophobic setting, even surprising with a few nice inventions for their heroine and villain.The film is far from perfect, of course.  It has literally the worst, least subtle score in the long, sad history of melodramatic scores.  As writers, they really miss out on opportunities here to allow the characters to come to life.  I wanted to learn more about who Bentley's character was.  I wanted to hear more about this obvious obsession he had with Angela, Rachel Nichols' character.  He had this night planned and put himself at great risk -- there had to have been more of a history there.  Why not take a few scenes to explain it?  You get the feeling that Bentley would have liked to explore this character more, and you wish they had had a little bit more fun, as when he lip-syncs to an Elvis song.The DVD itself is fairly bare-boned.  A couple of repetitive making-of docs and a boring commentary track (the director, who dresses like a wannabe hip-hopper in the behind-the-scenes footage, apparently believes the song ""Blue Christmas"" is about murder) make up its extras.

1118717,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B000YDMIN0,Kane's Review,"[1, 1]","Angela Bridges is a hardworking Executive Businesswoman who stays late on Christmas Eve to close one more deal before the holidays. As she shuts down for the night and heads to her car, she unfortunately finds out that it won't start. She receives some assistance from the parking security guard, Thomas, who calls a taxi for her, before asking her to have Christmas dinner with him. She kindly declines and waits in the lobby for the taxi. When it arrives, she discovers that she's locked in the lobby and scurries back to the parking garage, where she's chloroformed and kidnapped by Thomas.She later comes to, chained to a chair in Tom's security office, now dressed in a white dress in high heels. Other than discovering that Tom is a mentally unbalanced, lonely man who's had a crush on her for awhile, she also finds out that he's been watching her on the CCTV security camera for quite some time as well.Angela soon becomes involved in a murderous game of cat and mouse that involves her fighting for her life to not only escape the clutches of the psychopathic and obsessive Thomas, but to live to see Christmas Day and her family.Although this is your typical thriller movie about an obsessive stalker with a love interest that's snapped, it's an entertaining one nonetheless that's sure to keep you watching until the end. The grade A acting skills of Rachel Nichols and Wes Bentley make it even more entertaining, especially from Wes, who plays the psycho role almost TOO well! 5/5 from me and a recommended Christmas thriller to enjoy during the Christmas season",5,P2 Is A Perfect Christmas Thriller To Enjoy This Season,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,1574,"['Angela', 'Bridges', 'hardworking', 'Executive', 'Businesswoman', 'who', 'late', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'close', 'one', 'more', 'deal', 'holidays', 'down', 'night', 'heads', 'car', 'unfortunately', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'assistance', 'parking', 'security', 'guard', 'Thomas', 'who', 'taxi', 'asking', 'have', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'kindly', 'declines', 'waits', 'lobby', 'taxi', 'When', 'locked', 'lobby', 'scurries', 'back', 'parking', 'garage', 'where', 'chloroformed', 'kidnapped', 'Thomas.She', 'later', 'chained', 'chair', 'Tom', 'security', 'office', 'now', 'dressed', 'white', 'dress', 'high', 'heels', 'Other', 'discovering', 'Tom', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'lonely', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'crush', 'awhile', 'also', 'out', 'been', 'watching', 'CCTV', 'security', 'camera', 'quite', 'time', 'well.Angela', 'soon', 'becomes', 'involved', 'murderous', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'fighting', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'escape', 'clutches', 'psychopathic', 'obsessive', 'Thomas', 'live', 'see', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'family.Although', 'typical', 'thriller', 'movie', 'obsessive', 'stalker', 'love', 'interest', 'snapped', 'entertaining', 'one', 'nonetheless', 'sure', 'keep', 'watching', 'end', 'grade', 'A', 'acting', 'skills', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'Wes', 'who', 'psycho', 'role', 'almost', 'TOO', 'well', '5/5', 'recommended', 'Christmas', 'thriller', 'enjoy', 'Christmas', 'season']",P2 Theatrical Release

1118719,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000YDMIN0,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 4]","In ""P2,"" Rachel Nichols is an overworked and underappreciated corporate do-all who just wants to spend Christmas Eve with her family.  Wes Bentley is a lonely parking garage guard intent on having her spend Christmas Eve with him instead, no matter how many handcuffs, security cameras or guard dogs it will take.The story is pretty average as far as psycho stalker flicks go, albeit with a little more humor and a lot less gore.  Bentley's sick mind tries to justify everything that he does as he's stalking poor Nichols.  While he attempts to woo her, he eliminates a couple of troublesome folks along the way.  Only one of these eliminations comes with a decent amount of gore if that's your thing.  The suspense level is tepid, but the story did hold my attention to its completion.Nichols and Bentley do solid jobs with their respective roles.  Bentley in particular seems to be having fun playing a stalker.  Nichols brings an intelligence level to her role that normally lacks in most films in this genre.The special features on this disc are relatively ho-hum, especially the ""let's pat ourselves on the back"" making-of featurette.  Co-writer and producer Alexandre Aja grossly overestimates the ""greatness"" of this film, as does the very hip-hop looking director and co-writer, Frank Khalfoun.  The movie was decent, guys, but Hitchcock has nothing to worry about.Overall, ""P2"" pays off in the end.  There are a few expected outrageous scenes and one especially unbelievable event involving a 911 operator.  Many of the ""boo"" scenes are pretty predictable as well.  With that said, though, Bentley's portrayal of Thomas and Nichols' performance as Angela make this movie much better than it actually is.

It is nice to see a girl in this situation that actually tries to defend her self and escape. The movie is not perfect, but with its backdrop and low budget I think they did a good job. I did find this movie to be a suspenseful thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Keep in mind that if you are already afraid of underground parking lots, this movie will only add to your anxiety.

There is no end to the creative touches a director or writer or actor can add to this standard in an attempt to make their particular version unique.Somemoviesget this right.  Does ""P2""?First of all, 80% of the movie takes place in a parking garage.  This isn't to say there aren't a lot of different approaches to take to the motif, but coming up with creative scares and intriguing set-backs in a mostly barren expanse of painted concrete would tax the imagination of even the most wildly inventive scriptwriter.Secondly, the movie shows you all of its cards from the onset.  The killer is immediately identified and his motives made blindingly clear.  There is no depth to the tension and no stakes are raised.  No surprise ending.  No twist.  There is nothing but Thomas, a mildly psychotic security guard (American Beauty's Wes Bentley), and Angela, a moderately attractive business woman with massive cleavage (Alias's Rachel Nichols).  She runs.  He chases.  It happens some more.  At one point, Angela escapes; scared and bleeding, Angela inexplicably decides to stop and huddle (hide?) beneath one of the parking garage's five functional halogen lamps.  Meanwhile, Thomas takes a break from the terrorizing to lip sync a little Elvis and practice his dance moves.  Huh?It's the final nail in the coffin.  Uninspired and idiotic characters who do uninspired, idiotic things.  Even the movie's final ""showdown"" manages to be both dumb and despicable, although the soaring musical score wants you to believe its a moment of profound redemption.It's not profound.  It's not redeeming.  It's not even framed well.  It's a thriller without thrill, a slasher without the slash, and the only way it could be called either ""horror"" or ""terror"" is if you added an ""ible"" to the end of those words.

Braun,"[2, 3]","Lone lady in a big office building on Christmas Eve gets locked in by a lunatic security guard and goes through a nightmarish night of repeat attempts to escape.Stylishly better than it sounds, the role smacks of a script that Jodie Foster would've turned down, putting Rachel Nichols dead-on to make a mark as a film chick worthy of earning cult status. And let's face it: it's LIPSTICK and a dozen other girl-in-a-torn-slip-and-a-psycho films rolled into one: not appealing from the get-go but smarter than it was sold as.Suddenly there's a new screen heroine worth the price of a theater admission ticket, or the purchase of a DVD. Rachel Nichols has class and guts and director Franck Khalfoun has talent: they can, and ought to, think a sequel (cripes, did I say that?). Shudderingly spot-on nutcase Wes Bentley plays the nut with the keys and the dog. He's an excellent creepy security guard: the kind you'd pass every day and dismiss as a loser. The office gal does, and he, of course, is going to prove that he's not to be dismissed... for an hour and a half.Both creepy in content as well as in delivery, this is ensemble excellence at work: and from the DVD extras, it shows how a small team can craft a killer (pun, sorry) flick with smart, savvy direction, a couple of dedicated actors and a well-choreographed blend of camera excellence and tight storyboarding.Well photographed as in ""Yeah, we know it's crap, but we're making a great piece of crap"" cinematography. Well made small film that looks hugely budgeted because all of the talent hits the screen like the guts of a torture victim.

It probably should have been.  Rachel Nichols as Angela, the workaholic investment banker with no time for personal relationships is undeniably appealing in a Jodie Foster kind of way and Wes Bentley, in the role of the clich&eacute;d, clearly psychotic, over obsessive admirer has a few engaging moments, but largely the storyline and progression will not hold the interest of viewers who seek anything beyond pure escapist fare.The movie devolves - that's charitable since within the first ten minutes the parameters are pretty well established - to a perfunctory cat and mouse chase and as is the formulaic flow of action since Sigourney Weaver opened the floodgates to womanist cinematic self-determination and self-sufficiency, at some juncture the mouse is obliged to turn the tables, albeit in a very appealing, soaking wet, cleavage revealing, slip of a dress sure to bring out the prurience of the male demographic, not that there's anything wrong with that.If the objective was horror, the film fails to reach that threshold even with a couple of scenes that offer a goodly amount of splattered blood. The thrill quotient was equally as vacant as most of the action was highly predictable with the only real questions being how this post-modernist damsel manages to extricate herself and how long would it take for her to get it done so I could place the DVD in its' assigned space in the netherworld of my collection.",2,"Car service, okay...But phoning for a Taxi in NYC?",1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1610,"['film', 'was', 'local', 'theatres', 'so', 'quickly', 'time', 'got', 'DVD', 'had', 'forgotten', 'was', 'ever', 'general', 'release', 'thought', 'was', 'straight', 'video', 'production', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Angela', 'workaholic', 'investment', 'banker', 'time', 'personal', 'relationships', 'undeniably', 'appealing', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'kind', 'way', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'role', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'clearly', 'psychotic', 'obsessive', 'admirer', 'few', 'engaging', 'moments', 'largely', 'storyline', 'progression', 'will', 'not', 'hold', 'interest', 'viewers', 'who', 'seek', 'anything', 'pure', 'escapist', 'fare.The', 'movie', 'charitable', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'parameters', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'established', 'perfunctory', 'cat', 'mouse', 'chase', 'formulaic', 'flow', 'action', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'opened', 'floodgates', 'womanist', 'cinematic', 'self-determination', 'self-sufficiency', 'juncture', 'mouse', 'obliged', 'turn', 'tables', 'albeit', 'very', 'appealing', 'soaking', 'wet', 'cleavage', 'revealing', 'slip', 'dress', 'sure', 'bring', 'out', 'prurience', 'male', 'demographic', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'objective', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'reach', 'threshold', 'even', 'couple', 'scenes', 'offer', 'goodly', 'amount', 'splattered', 'blood', 'thrill', 'quotient', 'was', 'equally', 'as', 'vacant', 'most', 'action', 'was', 'highly', 'predictable', 'only', 'real', 'questions', 'being', 'how', 'post-modernist', 'damsel', 'manages', 'extricate', 'how', 'long', 'would', 'take', 'get', 'done', 'so', 'could', 'place', 'DVD', 'assigned', 'space', 'netherworld', 'collection']",P2 Theatrical Release

It's also the identifier of the parking garage level, the subterranean levels of a cavernous office building occupied by Angela (Rachel Nichols). A pretty office drone, she represents the lost caste of young women in America - she's not married, doesn't have a boyfriend, and is working twice as hard to excel in the fast-paced corporate world. P2 is the culmination of her fears: alone and without ""a man"" to look after her, Angela can't fend for herself in a parking lot.This admittedly misogynistic but common fear takes human form in Thomas (Wes Bentley), a parking attendant who has been stalking Angela. Thomas' plans culminate in kidnapping Angela on Christmas Eve.P2 is a war of wits between these two characters.  Angela is objectified by Thomas, dressed as Marilyn Monroe through the rest of the film. Thomas is a desperate loner, is resentful of the white collar object of his affection, and is fond of emulating Elvis. These exaggerated archetypes clearly identify what this movie is really all about: masculine vs. feminine, Mars vs. Venus. Their conflict is as much a battle of the sexes as it is a clash between working classes.P2 crackles in the beginning, when Angela plays a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with Thomas over dinner.  The tension reaches fever pitch when it becomes clear that Thomas isn't just deranged, he's protective and out to right the wrongs committed against his faux girlfriend. The problem is that P2 simply can't keep up the pace.Once Angela is free, the hunt is on, but it is interspersed with long stretches of time when Angela sits in a corner weeping. Fortunately, the damsel in distress finally decides to take matters in her own hands in the tradition of Final Girls from horror movies everywhere.The characters do everything right: Angela tries to call 911, the police arrive and check things out, and cell phones don't work in garages.  The believability of Angela's situation and the echoes we all remember of creepy moments in dark parking garages make P2 a better than average slasher flick.Unfortunately, P2 isn't sure how to conclude. We know there will be a violent showdown between Angela and Thomas, but by the end it's obvious how it will happen.  P2 also takes liberties with the effectiveness of stun guns, the persistence of Rottweilers, and the availability of fire alarms.  But if you can ignore those niggling points, P2 will stick in that dark part of your brain...the part that makes you look over your shoulder as you walk across that stretch of darkness in an empty parking lot.",3,Marilyn Monroe vs. Elvis,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,2633,"['P2', 'simple', 'horror', 'film', 'premise', 'right', 'there', 'tin', 'two', 'people', 'also', 'identifier', 'parking', 'garage', 'level', 'subterranean', 'levels', 'cavernous', 'office', 'building', 'occupied', 'Angela', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'A', 'pretty', 'office', 'drone', 'lost', 'caste', 'young', 'women', 'America', 'not', 'married', ""n't"", 'have', 'boyfriend', 'working', 'twice', 'as', 'hard', 'excel', 'fast-paced', 'corporate', 'world', 'P2', 'culmination', 'fears', 'alone', 'man', 'look', 'Angela', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fend', 'parking', 'lot.This', 'admittedly', 'misogynistic', 'common', 'fear', 'human', 'form', 'Thomas', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'parking', 'attendant', 'who', 'been', 'stalking', 'Angela', 'Thomas', 'plans', 'culminate', 'kidnapping', 'Angela', 'Christmas', 'Eve.P2', 'war', 'wits', 'two', 'characters', 'Angela', 'objectified', 'Thomas', 'dressed', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'rest', 'film', 'Thomas', 'desperate', 'loner', 'resentful', 'white', 'collar', 'object', 'affection', 'fond', 'emulating', 'Elvis', 'exaggerated', 'archetypes', 'clearly', 'identify', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'masculine', 'vs.', 'feminine', 'Mars', 'Venus', 'conflict', 'as', 'much', 'battle', 'sexes', 'clash', 'working', 'classes.P2', 'crackles', 'beginning', 'when', 'Angela', 'deadly', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'Thomas', 'dinner', 'tension', 'fever', 'pitch', 'when', 'clear', 'Thomas', ""n't"", 'just', 'deranged', 'protective', 'right', 'wrongs', 'committed', 'faux', 'girlfriend', 'problem', 'P2', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'pace.Once', 'Angela', 'free', 'hunt', 'interspersed', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'when', 'Angela', 'corner', 'weeping', 'Fortunately', 'damsel', 'distress', 'finally', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'tradition', 'Final', 'Girls', 'horror', 'movies', 'everywhere.The', 'characters', 'do', 'everything', 'right', 'Angela', 'call', '911', 'police', 'arrive', 'check', 'things', 'out', 'cell', 'phones', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'garages', 'believability', 'Angela', 'situation', 'echoes', 'remember', 'creepy', 'moments', 'dark', 'parking', 'garages', 'make', 'P2', 'better', 'average', 'slasher', 'flick.Unfortunately', 'P2', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'conclude', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'violent', 'showdown', 'Angela', 'Thomas', 'end', 'obvious', 'how', 'will', 'happen', 'P2', 'also', 'liberties', 'effectiveness', 'stun', 'guns', 'persistence', 'Rottweilers', 'availability', 'fire', 'alarms', 'can', 'ignore', 'niggling', 'points', 'P2', 'will', 'stick', 'dark', 'part', 'brain', 'part', 'look', 'shoulder', 'walk', 'stretch', 'darkness', 'empty', 'parking', 'lot']",P2 Theatrical Release

She is pretty much the last one in the building, and discovers her car won't start.  Thomas (Bentley) the parking attendant offers to help, but Angela soon realizes that he has ulterior motives.  Thomas attacks her with chloroform, and when she wakes up she is in an evening dress and chained to a table.

I mean, really, how much can a director do in a dimly lit parking ramp? Quite a bit, I found. Don't over-analyze and you're in for a good time.This is the type of fun romp that originally got me interested in the genre while I was growing up in the '80s. There's no overly complex plot, amazing effects or numbing backstory here - just a psychotic guard, a mean dog, a killer Cutlass, a busty blonde, the chase and 85 minutes of run time. Think of it as Duel confined to an underground ramp and you pretty much have the basic concept. Convincing and talented performances by the two leads are just icing on the cake.Obviously meant for a Christmas release (I can't find the reason why it was pushed back 11 months or pulled 1 ahead), this movie was rushed out of most Minneapolis-area theatres the week following its arrival. I had to scramble just to catch it on the big screen a second time. Yes, it's that good.

As she makes the lonely, nerve-racking walk through a dark and eerie parking garage to her car, something is not right. When the car doesn't start, everything goes downhill for Angela. The only other person around, the seemingly extremely helpful and friendly parking attendant Thomas (Wes Bentley), proves to be no help at all. In fact, Thomas is the whole problem. Madly infatuated with Angela, he is determined to keep her under his wing for as long as it takes to prove his love to her, no matter what that requires.Directed by co-writer Frank Khalfoun and produced by co-writer Alexandre Aja (of ""High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes fame), and also co-written by Gregory Levasseur, ""P2"" (which is NOT a sequel of any kind, despite the ""2"") sounds like your run of the mill psycho stalker/slasher flick with the added tension of the all too familiar, unfriendly parking garage setting. It is, however, far better than that. ""P2"" is another Alexandre Aja style tour de force of madness and tension. The performances are the driving force, and the two young actors, who are the only two people in the majority of the picture, are fantastic! Rachel Nichols is commanding and beautiful as the intelligent, victimized woman relentlessly fighting back against her psychotic captor, and Wes Bentley is delightfully demented as the Elvis fan who is too romantic for his own good. Even knowing how the film plays out, this is one you can watch more than once, and the great Christmas music from Elvis Presley and Eartha Kitt only makes it better. If you're a fan of horror/survival flicks, beautiful girls wonderfully filling out slinky dresses and wielding weapons (great cover on this DVD, by the way), corpses spilling intestines, and some very entertaining villains, this is one you should pick up! Especially if you're familiar with the unpleasant parking garage experience. I hate those places! My only complaint is that these movies always make the quiet, lonely guys total psychos that beautiful people have to ""deal"" with to get on with their beautiful lives. For the record, they are quite often the nicest guys out there, but hot girls love bad boys with big mouths, don't they?Anywho, this DVD comes with the usual, fair selection of extras for a single disc release. You've got your trailer, a decent commentary with the writing, producing, directing trio of filmmakers, and three featurettes on the making-of which mainly feature interviews with the filmmakers and cast.

'P2' certainly does.  This one combines pretty solid acting in a basically two character movie and a creepy circumstance (being trapped in a parking garage alone with a maniac.) I watched this one based on some other reviews I had read here and was not disapointed.  Sure you may pick out some flaws in logic but logic is not what makes horror films.  I think for the most part, the heroine, Angela, played well by Rachel Nichols, made pretty good decisions and didn't add to her plight by doing stupid things.  That was a plus.  Other reviewers also mentioned the DRESS.  I too wondered how she didn't fall out of that thing with all the action that was going on, but more than that.  Who made it?  That was quality.  While the people got all beat up and bloody, the dress came out of this film just needing a trip to a good dry cleaner.  Also, the ending to 'P2' just struck me as awesome.  It brings to mind 'FUNHOUSE' in the winter.  I loved it. Finally, it wouldn't be fair not to mention Wes Bentley simply because it was basically a two actor film and he was the other actor.

Rachel Nichols (soon to be seen in the live action take of G.I. Joe) stars as Angela; a young career girl whose trip home for Christmas gets delayed when she attracts a psychopathic security guard (American Beauty's Wes Bentley) at her office building.  Soon enough, he clubs her and chains her up to share Christmas dinner, but low and behold, Angela is a little bit resourceful, and turns the tables on her captor.  For a majority of P2, the film rarely elevates itself above its slasher and exploitation roots (the script is co-written by High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes remake Alexandre Aja, so this isn't much of a surprise), and while it offers some genuine shocks, scares, and blood letting; P2 is nothing special in the least thanks to the fact that there aren't nearly enough shocker moments, making the film kind of boring.  There was a great deal of potential here too (I for one would have loved to see how different it would have been had Aja directed), and while Nichols looks good in a tight dress and Bentley (who once upon a time seemed to have a promising career ahead of him) is creepy as usual; there just isn't enough here to really hold your interest.

The story is about a girl stuck in a parking garage and her troubles that comes along with that. It's not all that scary, it has a few jumping moments but it's more of a freaky movie than anything else. It does have a slow start, but it gets better.The story is ok and the acting is pretty good. I feel like they portray the characters they are playing. The violence is nice, it has some cool scenes and it helps move the story along. Some of the decisions the main character made didn't seem all that smart, but you let her get away with it considering the situation she is in.The atmosphere of the film is good. The garage is believable and is freaky at the same time. The lighting makes the garage come alive. Music in this movie fits it well, and adds to the atmosphere of the movie. One thing I have to say though, when she tries to leave, you clearly see a security guard across the street. I mean you THINK he would do something when he sees the girl locked in the building and hitting the plate glass with her hands.The special features of this DVD are mediocre. I mean they have behind the scenes stuff, but half of it is just screens from the movie you just watched, with the other half being the behind the scenes stuff.

Bentley gives an outstanding performance as the psychopathic stalker while Nichols also turns in a fine effort as his feisty victim.  The third character is not really a true character in the traditional sense, but the parking garage itself is masterfully brought to life by director Franck Khalfoun.  Whether it is the sequencing of Tom's turning off of the lights or the closing of doors and gates, the garage seems to close in on Angela like a tomb.  While there is plenty of action (and a modest amount of gore), this movie also plays out as much mentally as physically.  There is a chilling seen where Tom uses almost exclusively verbal coaxing to get Angela to explain away her absence to her family.  And while Tom is a masterful villain, Angela is no wilting flower willing to go meekly into the night.  She is brave and makes good decisions throughout - such as getting rid of her high heels when she needs to make a run for it.Good characters alone do not make a good movie.  The plot is believable for the most part, and Khalfoun directs the film at a pace that balances the suspense with a sense of urgency.  The script is free of cheesy dialogue and gratuitous nudity which plague many of the movies in this genre.  The bonus features add a modest amount of insight into the movie.  I found ""Designing Terror"" to be the most interesting.  While you don't notice it during the movie, one of the things they explained was the difficulty in having stunts in the confined space of the garage that did not cause any damage to the garage itself.All in all, this is a good movie for its genre.  While it is unlikely to win any awards, the director and cast produce an entertaining suspense/thriller.  If you are looking for something smarter than the typical slasher, give this a try.",4,Smart Suspense/Thriller With A Modest Amount Of Gore,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2736,"['P2', 'suspense/thriller', 'highly', 'driven', 'businesswoman', 'Angela', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'prey', 'stalker', 'parking', 'garage', 'security', 'guard', 'Tom', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'story', 'Angela', 'finishing', 'up', 'working', 'late', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'make', 'final', 'adjustments', 'big', 'contract', 'finally', 'away', 'large', 'office', 'building', 'almost', 'completely', 'deserted', 'scheduled', 'be', 'closed', 'next', 'three', 'days', 'repeated', 'calls', 'from/to', 'family', 'Angela', 'ready', 'head', 'out', 'when', 'down', 'car', 'parking', 'garage', 'level', 'guessed', 'P2', 'Much', 'chagrin', 'car', 'will', 'not', 'start', 'when', 'up', 'Tom', 'who', 'tries', 'help', 'movie', 'then', 'capture', 'hands', 'Tom', 'subsequent', 'attempts', 'escape', 'What', 'story', 'think', 'suspense', 'tension', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'very', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'P2', 'Bentley', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'psychopathic', 'stalker', 'Nichols', 'also', 'fine', 'effort', 'feisty', 'victim', 'third', 'character', 'not', 'really', 'true', 'character', 'traditional', 'sense', 'parking', 'garage', 'masterfully', 'brought', 'life', 'director', 'Franck', 'Khalfoun', 'sequencing', 'Tom', 'turning', 'off', 'lights', 'closing', 'doors', 'gates', 'garage', 'close', 'Angela', 'tomb', 'plenty', 'action', 'modest', 'amount', 'gore', 'movie', 'also', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'mentally', 'physically', 'chilling', 'seen', 'where', 'Tom', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'verbal', 'coaxing', 'get', 'Angela', 'explain', 'away', 'absence', 'family', 'Tom', 'masterful', 'villain', 'Angela', 'wilting', 'flower', 'willing', 'go', 'meekly', 'night', 'brave', 'good', 'decisions', 'such', 'getting', 'rid', 'high', 'heels', 'when', 'make', 'run', 'it.Good', 'characters', 'alone', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'plot', 'believable', 'most', 'part', 'Khalfoun', 'film', 'pace', 'suspense', 'sense', 'urgency', 'script', 'free', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'plague', 'many', 'movies', 'genre', 'bonus', 'add', 'modest', 'amount', 'insight', 'movie', 'found', 'Designing', 'Terror', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'movie', 'one', 'things', 'explained', 'was', 'difficulty', 'having', 'stunts', 'confined', 'space', 'garage', 'did', 'not', 'cause', 'damage', 'garage', 'itself.All', 'good', 'movie', 'genre', 'unlikely', 'win', 'awards', 'director', 'cast', 'produce', 'entertaining', 'suspense/thriller', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'smarter', 'typical', 'slasher', 'give', 'try']",P2 Theatrical Release

I received it as part of the Amazon Vine program, and wasn't expecting much.  However, it was quite good for this sort of movie. I liked the set-up at the beginning, where we see the heroine preparing to leave work late to celebrate Christmas Eve with her family.  She's credible and we get to know her enough to care about what happens to her, but things move quickly on to the sequence of terror that consumes the rest of the movie.Unlike some reviewers, I felt that the security guard who terrorizes her did a really good job, and didn't feel his performance was at all ""over the top"".  In fact, I thought his performance was reasonably balanced between an all-out psycho and a person who can manage to appear almost normal, if very creepy.A film like this is going to be violent and bloody, and if that's a problem, people shouldn't watch it.  I didn't think it was any more violent than most slashers, and actually a lot less violent than some I've seen, but that's a subjective judgment.What made this film better than the usual slasher flick was that the heroine was intelligent and basically did everything right.  She was very convincing as she made the gradual transition from shocked victim to calculating predator.  There were quite a few ""jump out of your seat"" moments, and an awesome sequence in a flooded elevator.  All in all, a very entertaining and fast-paced film for those who enjoy this genre.

For a movie about a woman running around in her underwear, this is a strangely inert deal. The main problem seems to be that the filmmakers relied on a pretty standard stalker script and forgot to populate it with interesting characters. The woman is cute. The security guard has some fun with Elvis impressions and Santa Claus costumes. But there's just a lot of scream. Scream. Run. Fight. Get beat up. Run. Fight. Repeat.It doesn't help that the stalker is more interesting. Don't know if he's the better actor but he does get the most to do. For these thrillers to work, you have to side with the victim and want her to get away. When the victim is a cypher and the stalker is more interesting, you really have no one to side with. By the halfway mark, I was starting to want the stalker to get his heart's desire whatever that might be - doesn't really go into the psychology of stalking or obsession - he's just crazy in movie script crazy speak.Essentially this is a play that's been adapted for the big screen. Sometimes that works like withGlengarry Glen Rossbut most of the time it just falls flat - likeThe Big Kahuna. Even the strongest actors can't get over a weak script with limp direction and these aren't the best actors in the world (although I will withhold judgment until I see either of them in other movies).",2,Inert,1251936000,"09 3, 2009",2009,1376,"['security', 'guard', 'creepy', 'Angela', 'screams', 'movie', 'woman', 'running', 'around', 'underwear', 'strangely', 'inert', 'deal', 'main', 'problem', 'be', 'filmmakers', 'relied', 'pretty', 'standard', 'stalker', 'script', 'forgot', 'populate', 'interesting', 'characters', 'woman', 'cute', 'security', 'guard', 'fun', 'Elvis', 'impressions', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'costumes', 'just', 'lot', 'scream', 'Scream', 'Run', 'Fight', 'Get', 'beat', 'up', 'Run', 'Fight', 'Repeat.It', ""n't"", 'help', 'stalker', 'more', 'interesting', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'actor', 'get', 'most', 'do', 'thrillers', 'work', 'have', 'side', 'victim', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'When', 'victim', 'cypher', 'stalker', 'more', 'interesting', 'really', 'have', 'one', 'side', 'halfway', 'mark', 'was', 'starting', 'want', 'stalker', 'get', 'heart', 'desire', 'whatever', 'might', 'be', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'psychology', 'stalking', 'obsession', 'just', 'crazy', 'movie', 'script', 'crazy', 'speak.Essentially', 'play', 'been', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'withGlengarry', 'Glen', 'Rossbut', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'flat', 'likeThe', 'Big', 'Kahuna', 'Even', 'strongest', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'weak', 'script', 'limp', 'direction', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'actors', 'world', 'will', 'withhold', 'judgment', 'see', 'other', 'movies']",P2 Theatrical Release
1118752,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000YDMIN0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","&lt;strong>P2&lt;/strong> (Franck Khalfoun, 2007)&lt;em>P2&lt;/em> has so much going for it. There's a solid cast, a promising young director who seems to have a good instinct for making a suspense film, a nice hook, some interesting quirks, and lovely setup.Balanced against all that is the fact that the film was written and produced by the long-running team of Alexandre Aja and Gr&eacute;gory Levasseur. In case those two names don't mean anything to you, let me help: 2005's &lt;em>Haute Tension&lt;/em>, a boring splat-pack film with plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. 2006's bland, ultra-right-wing remake of &lt;em>The Hills Have Eyes&lt;/em>. 2008's &lt;em>Mirrors&lt;/em>, an unnecessary, though at least technically competent, remake of the Korean horror flick &lt;em>Into the Mirror&lt;/em>. And, lastly, 2010's remake (yes, we seem to have a pair of specialists here) of &lt;em>Piranha&lt;/em>. Even if you've never seen any of these movies, there's a pattern that it should be pretty easy to determine: Aja and Levasseur are not known for their originality. The one original script they wrote, to be kind, sucks huge green donkey balls. Which makes me wonder what the odds are that anything at all good could have come from this. That Khalfoun (a longtime associate of the two; he appeared in both &lt;em>Haute Tension&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Piranha&lt;/em> as an actor) managed to get something even watchable out of this is pretty darned impressive.Plot: Angela (&lt;em>Star Trek&lt;/em>'s Rachel Nichols) is the low girl on the totem pole at a high-powered financial firm in New York City, and her bosses force her to work late on Christmas Eve. (One wonders if Nichols took the part in order to live an alternate life; she double-majored in math and econ in college.) By the time she's ready to leave, the only folks left in the building are Angela, Karl (&lt;em>Cube 2&lt;/em>'s Philip Akin) the building security guard, and Thomas (&lt;em>American Beauty&lt;/em>'s Wes Bentley), the parking attendant. All well and good, except that Angela finds out that the garage has been locked for the holiday, and she's stuck on P2 (thus the name of the movie). Thomas jokingly offers her half his dinner, and she refuses. Next thing she knows, she's in his office, chained to a chair...I'm not entirely sure whether Thomas being the bad guy was supposed to be a spoiler. It felt like it while I was watching the movie, but everything I've read, including the movie's official summary, reveals this plot point. So, if I'm wrong, my apologies. Not that it really matters much, as you know exactly where you're going from moment one. There's nothing here you haven't seen before--which is exactly what you should expect from a script from Aja and Levasseur, the remake doctors. The only difference between this and &lt;em>The Hills Have Eyes&lt;/em> is that there are easily three dozen films this could be a remake of.Actually, that's not the only difference. The other one is Khalfoun, who in his first feature shows more directing acumen, more sympathy with his characters, and more sense of the value of ambiguity than Alexandre Aja has ever even dreamed of. Everything that is good about this movie comes from either Khalfoun or his surprisingly strong cast (both Nichols and Bentley are believable, three-dimensional constructs in inherently stereotypical roles). A parking garage is pretty much by definition a huge open space, even underground, but Khalfoun and cinematographer Maxime Alexandre (&lt;em>The Crazies&lt;/em>), another Aja regular, manage to rig the lighting and camera angles to makes much of this film as close an experience as possible. It never quite gets to ""claustrophobic"", but it gives it the good old college try, and that's impressive. In short, there's a lot to like about this movie, but at every juncture, it has its feet cut out from under it by Aja and Levasseur's trite, tired script. I can't wait to see what Khalfoun will do when, if, he strikes out on his own. ** ",3,Could have been so much more.,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,4021,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'P2', 'lt', '>', 'Franck', 'Khalfoun', '2007', 'lt', '>', 'P2', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'solid', 'cast', 'promising', 'young', 'director', 'who', 'have', 'good', 'instinct', 'making', 'suspense', 'film', 'nice', 'hook', 'interesting', 'quirks', 'lovely', 'setup.Balanced', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'long-running', 'team', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'Gr', 'eacute', 'gory', 'Levasseur', 'case', 'two', 'names', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'let', 'help', '2005', 'lt', '>', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'lt', '>', 'boring', 'splat-pack', 'film', 'plot', 'holes', 'big', 'enough', 'drive', 'truck', '2006', 'bland', 'ultra-right-wing', 'remake', 'lt', '>', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'lt', '>', '2008', 'lt', '>', 'Mirrors', 'lt', '>', 'unnecessary', 'though', 'least', 'technically', 'competent', 'remake', 'Korean', 'horror', 'flick', 'lt', '>', 'Into', 'Mirror', 'lt', '>', 'lastly', '2010', 'remake', 'yes', 'seem', 'have', 'pair', 'specialists', 'here', 'lt', '>', 'Piranha', 'lt', '>', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movies', 'pattern', 'should', 'be', 'pretty', 'easy', 'determine', 'Aja', 'Levasseur', 'are', 'not', 'known', 'originality', 'one', 'original', 'script', 'wrote', 'be', 'kind', 'huge', 'green', 'donkey', 'balls', 'Which', 'wonder', 'what', 'odds', 'are', 'anything', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'Khalfoun', 'longtime', 'associate', 'two', 'appeared', 'lt', '>', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'Piranha', 'lt', '>', 'actor', 'managed', 'get', 'something', 'even', 'watchable', 'pretty', 'darned', 'impressive.Plot', 'Angela', 'lt', '>', 'Star', 'Trek', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'low', 'girl', 'totem', 'pole', 'high-powered', 'financial', 'firm', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'bosses', 'force', 'work', 'late', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'One', 'Nichols', 'took', 'part', 'order', 'live', 'alternate', 'life', 'double-majored', 'math', 'econ', 'college', 'time', 'ready', 'leave', 'only', 'folks', 'left', 'building', 'are', 'Angela', 'Karl', 'lt', '>', 'Cube', '2', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Philip', 'Akin', 'building', 'security', 'guard', 'Thomas', 'lt', '>', 'American', 'Beauty', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'parking', 'attendant', 'well', 'good', 'Angela', 'out', 'garage', 'been', 'locked', 'holiday', 'stuck', 'P2', 'thus', 'name', 'movie', 'Thomas', 'jokingly', 'dinner', 'Next', 'thing', 'office', 'chained', 'chair', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'Thomas', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'spoiler', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'including', 'movie', 'official', 'summary', 'plot', 'point', 'So', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'apologies', 'Not', 'really', 'matters', 'much', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'moment', 'one', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'expect', 'script', 'Aja', 'Levasseur', 'remake', 'doctors', 'only', 'difference', 'lt', '>', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'lt', '>', 'are', 'easily', 'three', 'dozen', 'films', 'could', 'be', 'remake', 'of.Actually', 'not', 'only', 'difference', 'other', 'one', 'Khalfoun', 'who', 'first', 'feature', 'more', 'directing', 'acumen', 'more', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'more', 'sense', 'value', 'ambiguity', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'ever', 'even', 'dreamed', 'Everything', 'good', 'movie', 'Khalfoun', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'cast', 'Nichols', 'Bentley', 'are', 'believable', 'three-dimensional', 'constructs', 'inherently', 'stereotypical', 'roles', 'parking', 'garage', 'pretty', 'much', 'definition', 'huge', 'open', 'space', 'even', 'underground', 'Khalfoun', 'cinematographer', 'Maxime', 'Alexandre', 'lt', '>', 'Crazies', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Aja', 'regular', 'manage', 'rig', 'lighting', 'camera', 'angles', 'much', 'film', 'close', 'experience', 'possible', 'never', 'quite', 'claustrophobic', 'good', 'old', 'college', 'try', 'impressive', 'short', 'lot', 'like', 'movie', 'juncture', 'feet', 'cut', 'out', 'Aja', 'Levasseur', 'trite', 'tired', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Khalfoun', 'will', 'do', 'when', 'out', 'own', '**']",P2 Theatrical Release

The only saving grace was (Angela) Nichols and her decent acting, but (Thomas) Bentley comes off more like a wanna be psycho than a really good madman IMO.

1118755,A1JEFESGLIS076,B000YDMIN0,rsoonsa,"[1, 9]","A downbeat example of the cinematic Theatre of Paranoia genre that does not succeed as either entertainment or as an artistic effort, this woefully logic-lorn film's storyline begins to unravel shortly after its opening scenes.  Angela (Rachel Nichols) is working late at her employer's office building on Christmas Eve, and when she attempts to depart for a visit with her family for the holiday, her automobile will not start, thereby apparently trapping her in a virtually deserted and dark parking garage (P-2).  Not a little apprehensive, she is made somewhat encouraged by an offer of assistance from the building security guard, Thomas (performed with relish by Wes Bentley).  Regrettably, this latter individual is somewhat unhinged, and it is not long before Angela's gratitude for his willingness to help has dimmed, Tom making it palpable that she is to be his for the holiday, and beyond.  The set-up sequences of the film will, in fact, engage the attention of most viewers, being tightly scripted and capably performed, but as the work advances, clich&eacute;s proliferate and it becomes a rather unexceptional and tasteless melodrama that wants a distinctive style, breaches in continuity growing apace.  The scenario eventually focuses upon a confrontation, more of a physical than psychologic nature, between Angela and her demented captor, frenzied at times but not consistently engrossing.  It includes a nonsensical game of vehicular chicken waged between the warring principals, in addition to a surplusage of gratuitous bloodletting for the delight of the sensibility challenged.  Although it is hardly possible to be grateful for this film on any of its levels (including P-2), one might find here an odd moment of efficiently organized suspense, despite an obvious lack of doubt as to its outcome, with such a possible sense of wonder plainly intended to be overridden by the attire worn by Nichols throughout most of the action: a camisole slip with pushup, given considerably extra transparence following an entirely extraneous scene wherein she is water doused.  Albeit there is no sting in the tail of this story, the DVD package is of fine quality, with both the widescreen (2.35:1) visuals and the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound being more than satisfactory, even if for nothing else but in the service of a hackneyed narrative.  Three extra short features are included: ""A New Level of Fear: The Making of P2""; ""Designing Terror""; and ""Tension Nouveau: Presenting Franck Khalfoun"".  Additionally, director Khalfoun, in concert with his co-screenwriters and producers Alexandre Aja and Gregory Levasseur discuss the film upon an audio commentary version, notable primarily for its illumination of a mutual admiration society created by the trio.  The mentioned bonus features give short shrift to those other members of the cast and crew who competently contribute to the production; in particular, designers and stunt performers, neither group able to salvage an over-extended rehash of similar-themed movies that is smothered in an ambience of nonobjective indulgence.",1,Will Appeal In The Main To Those Who Enjoy Structured Incoherence.,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,3093,"['downbeat', 'example', 'cinematic', 'Theatre', 'Paranoia', 'genre', 'not', 'succeed', 'entertainment', 'artistic', 'effort', 'woefully', 'logic-lorn', 'film', 'storyline', 'unravel', 'shortly', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Angela', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'working', 'late', 'employer', 'office', 'building', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'when', 'depart', 'visit', 'family', 'holiday', 'automobile', 'will', 'not', 'start', 'thereby', 'apparently', 'trapping', 'virtually', 'deserted', 'dark', 'parking', 'garage', 'P-2', 'Not', 'little', 'apprehensive', 'made', 'somewhat', 'encouraged', 'offer', 'assistance', 'building', 'security', 'guard', 'Thomas', 'performed', 'relish', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Regrettably', 'latter', 'individual', 'somewhat', 'unhinged', 'not', 'long', 'Angela', 'gratitude', 'willingness', 'help', 'dimmed', 'Tom', 'making', 'palpable', 'be', 'holiday', 'set-up', 'sequences', 'film', 'will', 'fact', 'engage', 'attention', 'most', 'viewers', 'being', 'tightly', 'scripted', 'capably', 'performed', 'work', 'advances', 'clich', 'eacute', 'proliferate', 'rather', 'unexceptional', 'tasteless', 'melodrama', 'distinctive', 'style', 'breaches', 'continuity', 'growing', 'apace', 'scenario', 'eventually', 'confrontation', 'more', 'physical', 'psychologic', 'nature', 'Angela', 'demented', 'captor', 'frenzied', 'times', 'not', 'consistently', 'engrossing', 'nonsensical', 'game', 'vehicular', 'chicken', 'waged', 'warring', 'principals', 'addition', 'surplusage', 'gratuitous', 'bloodletting', 'delight', 'sensibility', 'challenged', 'hardly', 'possible', 'be', 'grateful', 'film', 'levels', 'including', 'P-2', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'here', 'odd', 'moment', 'efficiently', 'organized', 'suspense', 'obvious', 'lack', 'doubt', 'outcome', 'possible', 'sense', 'wonder', 'plainly', 'intended', 'be', 'overridden', 'attire', 'worn', 'Nichols', 'most', 'action', 'camisole', 'slip', 'pushup', 'given', 'considerably', 'extra', 'transparence', 'following', 'entirely', 'extraneous', 'scene', 'wherein', 'water', 'doused', 'sting', 'tail', 'story', 'DVD', 'package', 'fine', 'quality', 'widescreen', '2.35:1', 'visuals', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'sound', 'being', 'more', 'satisfactory', 'even', 'nothing', 'else', 'service', 'hackneyed', 'narrative', 'Three', 'extra', 'short', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'New', 'Level', 'Fear', 'Making', 'P2', 'Designing', 'Terror', 'Tension', 'Nouveau', 'Presenting', 'Franck', 'Khalfoun', 'Additionally', 'director', 'Khalfoun', 'concert', 'co-screenwriters', 'producers', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'Gregory', 'Levasseur', 'film', 'audio', 'commentary', 'version', 'notable', 'primarily', 'illumination', 'mutual', 'admiration', 'society', 'created', 'trio', 'mentioned', 'bonus', 'features', 'give', 'short', 'shrift', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', 'who', 'competently', 'contribute', 'production', 'particular', 'designers', 'stunt', 'performers', 'group', 'able', 'salvage', 'over-extended', 'rehash', 'similar-themed', 'movies', 'smothered', 'ambience', 'nonobjective', 'indulgence']",P2 Theatrical Release

To my surprise (and my wife's), while the movie is not a work of art it resulted very entertaining and scary at times. At first there are a lot of the typical frights you find in this type of films, the silent scene where an animal appears suddenly and the like.Wes Bentley was very creepy in his character, not giving away too many details, the guy works as a security guard in the parking lot of the company the protagonist works in, and on Christmas Eve he decides to let her know he's obsessed with her. What follows is an entertaining film with some very well made horror sequences, beware, there are a couple gore scenes you may want to keep an eye for. Keep in mind this is a popcorn movie with lots of frights and a heroine trying to survive.This presentation of the movie includes an audio commentary with the director (while I could watch the movie again, I don't feel the director commentary is going to improve the experience whatsoever) and three mini documentaries: ""The making of"" which runs over 10 minutes and ""Designing terror"" and ""Tension noveau"" which give details on the design of the film and some special effects, these two last between 3 or 5  minutes.

1118757,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B000YDMIN0,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[1, 1]","I've parked in major parking garages like this so I know there has to be some concern about one's safety.  So, for employees that are of the very few left to go home, this is definitely a dangerous situation since these kinds of parking environments offer a probable means of shelter to the homeless and the desperate.However, in this film, it's the security guard of the parking garage that is the threat to the last few people leaving the building.What makes this movie rather unbelievable is how cafefully calculated the sick security guard happens to be.  How can a man like this have a job there so long and remained on good terms for so long, then suddenly go on a killing spree in the building that he works for?  He was sick in the mind.  He had no grasp of reality on how he was thinking that he was doing the right thing to protect the girl.  To protect her from her fellow employees (from a mild infraction of a means of sexual harassment) by killing them in front of her and expected her to thank him.In this film, you get to enjoy some gore.  One incident is when the security guard crushes one of her fellow employees up against a cement wall with the car.  He was squished to a point when his guts were spilled out, then he backs up and rams him again to crush his head to squish his brains out.  There were other means of gore, but that one stands out in my memory the most.The one thing that does bother me about this film is how RCA (or who ever it is these days who have the rights to Elvis' music) allowed this sick security guard to dance and sing to his Elvis Presley records while he's psychologically torturing his victim.  That's creating a distorted image for us to see in the future when we hear Elvis Presley music, especially at Christmas.This movie moves kinda slow.  Very little really happens throughout the film and I'm sure most of the budget went to some of the detailed gory visuals and, of course, paying for the use of Elvis Presley music.I've seen a lot of low budget horror films.  I don't know what compels me to do so because I seldom ever have seen one that I'd watch again. Most of my favorite horror films come from the eighties.  And what's more, I enjoy psychological horror more than visual horror.  If a film can scare me to death without depending on blood, death, or seeing anyone killed, than that's my idea of creative writing.  Because psychological horror stands to be more true to everyday reality.  We all have fears about things that can happen, but just hasn't happened yet.",3,This film has its moments,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,2533,"[""'ve"", 'parked', 'major', 'parking', 'garages', 'so', 'know', 'there', 'be', 'concern', 'one', 'safety', 'So', 'employees', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'left', 'go', 'home', 'definitely', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'kinds', 'parking', 'environments', 'offer', 'probable', 'means', 'shelter', 'homeless', 'desperate.However', 'film', 'security', 'guard', 'parking', 'garage', 'threat', 'last', 'few', 'people', 'leaving', 'building.What', 'movie', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'how', 'cafefully', 'calculated', 'sick', 'security', 'guard', 'be', 'How', 'can', 'man', 'have', 'job', 'there', 'so', 'long', 'remained', 'good', 'terms', 'so', 'long', 'then', 'suddenly', 'go', 'killing', 'spree', 'building', 'was', 'sick', 'mind', 'had', 'grasp', 'reality', 'how', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'protect', 'girl', 'protect', 'fellow', 'employees', 'mild', 'infraction', 'means', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'killing', 'front', 'expected', 'thank', 'him.In', 'film', 'get', 'enjoy', 'gore', 'One', 'incident', 'when', 'security', 'guard', 'one', 'fellow', 'employees', 'up', 'cement', 'wall', 'car', 'was', 'squished', 'point', 'when', 'guts', 'were', 'spilled', 'out', 'then', 'up', 'rams', 'again', 'crush', 'head', 'squish', 'brains', 'out', 'were', 'other', 'means', 'gore', 'one', 'out', 'memory', 'most.The', 'one', 'thing', 'bother', 'film', 'how', 'RCA', 'who', 'ever', 'days', 'who', 'have', 'rights', 'Elvis', 'music', 'allowed', 'sick', 'security', 'guard', 'dance', 'sing', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'records', 'psychologically', 'torturing', 'victim', 'creating', 'distorted', 'image', 'see', 'future', 'when', 'hear', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'music', 'especially', 'Christmas.This', 'movie', 'moves', 'kinda', 'slow', 'Very', 'little', 'really', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'budget', 'went', 'detailed', 'gory', 'visuals', 'course', 'paying', 'use', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'music.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'compels', 'do', 'so', 'seldom', 'ever', 'have', 'seen', 'one', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'Most', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'come', 'eighties', 'what', 'more', 'enjoy', 'psychological', 'horror', 'more', 'visual', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'scare', 'death', 'depending', 'blood', 'death', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'killed', 'idea', 'creative', 'writing', 'psychological', 'horror', 'be', 'more', 'true', 'everyday', 'reality', 'have', 'fears', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'just', ""n't"", 'happened', 'yet']",P2 Theatrical Release

After I heard a review by a certain ""Dr"" on a local radio station in my area, I knew there might be some redeeming features, since everything she dislikes, I almost always love.Basically, P2 is like the film THE CUBE, where no context is given, but this is ultimately more suffocating since the dimensions of the prison is given some ""daylight"" at times; by this I mean that the CUBE shows no hope, but P2 often does, in a kind of teasing manner.The Cage is the Parking lot, and the terror is how things play out between Wes Bentley's Character and Rachel's character. The violence is not as extreme as I had expected, but works in a more powerful way because it is in such a constricted space.In part it is the slasher feel of the violence that makes that horror work, but the FX are sostylised that it is hard to believe that anyone could accept it as real.At times Wes is very Reminiscent of his Character in GHOST RIDER, but at other times he is very divergant from it.

Come to think of it, the only time I have been in an underground parking deck may have been playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. So P2, a suspenseful thriller about being confined to an underground parking deck, really isn't up my alley.Despite taking place on Christmas Eve, the timing had to do more about picking a day where no one would be there late (sans our heroine of course), than making this a holiday theme thriller, granted a well placed Blue Christmas is used. The protagonist in question is Rachel Nichols (Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd) who plays the damsel is distress quite well in a how does she not pop out of that dress with all that action going on kind of way.She is put into that dress by lowly parking attendant Wes Bentley (Soul Survivors) who takes matters into his own hands when Nichols laughs off his suggestion of eating Christmas dinner with him when her car doesn't start as the last one out of the parking deck. Needless to say Bentley meticulously planned everything to keep Nichols inside the building locking all the exits with the underground dwelling helping out with the bad cell phone reception.But as Nichols breaks free, the movie turning into a slow moving, literally, Bentley goes after her with Jason Voorhees-like speed throughout the whole movie, plot with somewhat interesting encounters, like when Nichols finds a ax or is stuck in an elevator, buffered by boring cat and mouse games. It is hard to tell what is more to blame, Bentley, who cannot command a movie when he is one of only two people on screen, or the screenwriters who thought the location of a darkly lit underground place could write itself as a horror flick that they skimp on actual thrills, but P2 may have been an idea best left on the drawing board.",2,I Can Stay Here in This Parking Lot All By Myself,1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,1981,"['life', 'long', 'suburban', 'dweller', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'experience', 'parking', 'decks', 'even', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'ground', 'accessed', 'daylight', 'overcrowded', 'end', 'ball', 'game', 'Come', 'think', 'only', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'underground', 'parking', 'deck', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', 'Vice', 'City', 'So', 'P2', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'being', 'confined', 'underground', 'parking', 'deck', 'really', ""n't"", 'up', 'alley.Despite', 'taking', 'place', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'timing', 'had', 'do', 'more', 'picking', 'day', 'where', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'late', 'heroine', 'course', 'making', 'holiday', 'theme', 'thriller', 'granted', 'well', 'placed', 'Blue', 'Christmas', 'used', 'protagonist', 'question', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Dumb', 'Dumberer', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'damsel', 'distress', 'quite', 'well', 'how', 'not', 'pop', 'dress', 'action', 'going', 'kind', 'way.She', 'put', 'dress', 'lowly', 'parking', 'attendant', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'who', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'when', 'Nichols', 'suggestion', 'eating', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'when', 'car', ""n't"", 'start', 'last', 'one', 'parking', 'deck', 'Needless', 'say', 'Bentley', 'meticulously', 'planned', 'everything', 'keep', 'Nichols', 'building', 'locking', 'exits', 'underground', 'dwelling', 'helping', 'out', 'bad', 'cell', 'phone', 'reception.But', 'Nichols', 'breaks', 'free', 'movie', 'turning', 'slow', 'moving', 'literally', 'Bentley', 'Jason', 'Voorhees-like', 'speed', 'whole', 'movie', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'encounters', 'when', 'Nichols', 'ax', 'stuck', 'elevator', 'buffered', 'boring', 'cat', 'mouse', 'games', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'more', 'blame', 'Bentley', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'command', 'movie', 'when', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'screen', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'thought', 'location', 'darkly', 'lit', 'underground', 'place', 'could', 'write', 'horror', 'flick', 'skimp', 'actual', 'thrills', 'P2', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'idea', 'best', 'left', 'drawing', 'board']",P2 Theatrical Release

And ""P2"" is no exception.  This is a GREAT movie!The story is realitivly simple.  A working class young woman gets accidentally locked in a parking garage on Christmas eve.  Or is it accidental?  She comes to quickly realize she's been locked in there by a homacidal young security gaurd named Thomas.  From there it is a fight for survival for our herione as she tries to avoid Thomas and find a way out of the nightmare.Definately not for the squimish, this movie is bloody and gory.  It's also a suprisingly tense movie as we watch her try to get out of a seemingly impposible situation.Not to say that the movie is not without faults.  It is a ""B"" movie.  So some of the acting could be better, and the script could've done with a little tightning up.

In addition to it turning out to be an awesome suspense, the main actress Rachel Nichols (the promiscuous babysitter from the The Amityville Horror remake) with her low cut dress didn't hurt matters. It has to be one of the better edge of your seat thrillers we have seen in a long time. It's a wonder how this one bombed in the box office? Which happens to be fine with Sid because we prefer the lesser liked films that either are or walk the line of B.The story takes place on Christmas Eve, Sid's favorite, where the non-stop executive Angela pulls another late night. In hopes of making her family Christmas party she hops into her BMW only to find it won't start. Now being the only one n the locked garage she seeks help from Thomas the parking security guard. Big mistake as she doesn't realize Thomas is an obsessed peep freak whose been waiting for the perfect time to pounce on Angela. He winds up holding her hostage forcing her to join him for dinner in his garage office (much like a Santa/Brett Q meeting would most likely pan out). From here on out things just get worse and worse and he tries the worst way to pick up a chick possible. Even Mystery & Matador couldn't help this guy.Certainly far better then Sid could have even imagined. Since trailers were all over tv we stayed away from it. Our bag is more of the straight to video market, but from time to time we splurge and give bigger flicks a shot. P2 was worth the chance because it was awesome. It contained the right amount of suspense, laughs, and WTF moments making this one a 5 star event in Sid's humble opinion.

1118765,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B000YDMIN0,Sky,"[2, 3]","Nothing gives my wife the creeps more than a large, dark, parking garage...especially late at night. Heck, depending on what part of town I'm parked in I get the creeps myself....Even at the airport. You'd think that the NYC airport parking garages would be busy and full of people all the time, right? Let me tell you...they are not! Airports can be in some pretty seedy areas, and even though there's tons of cars parked in the garages, it seems like I'm always alone when I walk to and from my car.Could you imagine getting locked in one of these garages by accident...or worse...on purpose!I think that everyone considering P2 knows going in (just by looking at the cover of the DVD) that it's about a woman that indeed is trapped and pursued by some psycho in a parking garage. And the movie is as predictable as ever. You could probably write the story in advance of seeing it, and then wind up pretty close to the matching your story with the result in the movie.But the movie is actually done very well. First-time Director Franck Khalfoun is at the helm with help from hisHigh Tensionbuddy Alexandre Aja. Khalfoun keeps the pace moving at a fast clip, and keeps the movie more in the Thriller category than the Horror category (although there are two really gross-out scenes...one more than the other).P2 is pretty much a 2-person show, and both of the lead actors (the up and coming Rachel Nichols and the strangely affective Wes Bentley) take their roles very seriously. The acting was a lot better than I decided in advance it would be.The story is as simple as I stated earlier: woman trapped in parking garage with psycho. A dark parking garage is no laughing matter; bad things can and do happen in them. And when they happen, they probably happen fast...meaning robbery, rape or other quick attack. You'll be able to hang in there easily with this movie if can get around that the psycho in P2 takes his assault to another ""level"" in P2 (and--as always with Hollywood--the cops are clueless).Overall, I was entertained.

1118767,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B000YDMIN0,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[1, 4]","P2 is another in a now infinite line of  damsel in distress  horror films.  The setup is pretty standard. Cute girl gets kidnapped by obssessed admirer and spends the bulk of the film trying to escape and elude him.  The action takes place almost entirely in a parking garage, hence the title.Rachel Nichols, who was introduced to the world in the last season of ALIAS, plays the role of Angela well, beginning with frustration at being locked in the parking garage, then fear as she realizes her plight, and finally anger and resolve to survive and fight back.Now, this is the element that the original marketing campaign latched on.  We were told that, for once, our female victim would not just run and scream, but would turn the tables on her attacker.  This is something I was really looking forward to.  Unfortunately (though not surprisingly), this really isn't how the film plays out.  Not until the final 10 minutes, anyway - which can be said of any of these kinds of horror movies. No, Angela spends the bulk of the movie on the run, trying to escape or hide. Now, true enough she is not the usual brain-dead idiot these films portray.  She mostly makes smart decisions. And the final fight back is as satisfying as it usually is, but nowhere near as drawn out as the marketing led us to believe it would be.Wes Bentley plays the psychopathic building security officer, Thomas.  Apparently he was sufficiently creepy as the bag-obssessed amateur filmmaker from AMERICAN BEAUTY to land this role. The first few scenes as Thomas slowly unveils his darker side are very creepy and effective.  But unfortunately, once Angela escapes, he quickly becomes a conglomerate of every movie psycho cliche you've ever seen.  The film squanders an interesting premise for the typical monster-chase.  I would like to have seen Angela play a little more psychologically with Thomas before beginning the chase.  It might also have been nice to have learned why Thomas is doing what he's doing. We never really know what drove him to behave the way he does.  He's ""just crazy,"" and that seems to be good enough for the producers.The film is certainly polished, kind of a B-movie story with A-movie production value.  Fans of horror/suspense will find plenty to like here.  Fans of gore will find some bits to enjoy as well.  And fans of cleavage, well, just look at the poster - that's pretty much what our lady will be running around in for the entirety of the film (her bra should have been nominated for ""best support OF an actress"").  It is ironic that, in a film that was marketed as having a strong female lead and with overtones of female empowerment, the leading lady will spend the entirety of the film nearly falling out of her slip, often glistening with water or sweat - but I digress.All told, there is enough here to recommend to fans of recent films like Captivity, Rest Stop, or the Texas Chainsaw remake - but anyone looking for a really deep and intelligent thriller might want to stay on the ground level.",3,"A ""fun""  entry in the genre that entertains, but leaves no lasting impression.",1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,3017,"['P2', 'now', 'infinite', 'line', 'damsel', 'distress', 'horror', 'films', 'setup', 'pretty', 'standard', 'Cute', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'obssessed', 'admirer', 'bulk', 'film', 'trying', 'escape', 'elude', 'action', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'parking', 'garage', 'hence', 'title.Rachel', 'Nichols', 'who', 'was', 'introduced', 'world', 'last', 'season', 'ALIAS', 'role', 'Angela', 'well', 'beginning', 'frustration', 'being', 'locked', 'parking', 'garage', 'then', 'fear', 'plight', 'finally', 'anger', 'resolve', 'survive', 'fight', 'back.Now', 'element', 'original', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'latched', 'were', 'told', 'once', 'female', 'victim', 'would', 'not', 'just', 'run', 'scream', 'would', 'turn', 'tables', 'attacker', 'something', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'really', ""n't"", 'how', 'film', 'out', 'Not', 'final', '10', 'minutes', 'anyway', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'kinds', 'horror', 'movies', 'No', 'Angela', 'bulk', 'movie', 'run', 'trying', 'escape', 'hide', 'Now', 'true', 'enough', 'not', 'usual', 'brain-dead', 'idiot', 'films', 'portray', 'mostly', 'smart', 'decisions', 'final', 'fight', 'back', 'as', 'satisfying', 'usually', 'nowhere', 'drawn', 'marketing', 'led', 'believe', 'would', 'be.Wes', 'Bentley', 'psychopathic', 'building', 'security', 'officer', 'Thomas', 'Apparently', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'creepy', 'bag-obssessed', 'amateur', 'filmmaker', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'land', 'role', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'Thomas', 'slowly', 'darker', 'side', 'are', 'very', 'creepy', 'effective', 'unfortunately', 'once', 'Angela', 'escapes', 'quickly', 'conglomerate', 'movie', 'psycho', 'cliche', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'squanders', 'interesting', 'premise', 'typical', 'monster-chase', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'Angela', 'play', 'little', 'more', 'psychologically', 'Thomas', 'beginning', 'chase', 'might', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'learned', 'why', 'Thomas', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'drove', 'behave', 'way', 'just', 'crazy', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'producers.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'polished', 'kind', 'B-movie', 'story', 'A-movie', 'production', 'value', 'Fans', 'horror/suspense', 'will', 'find', 'plenty', 'like', 'here', 'Fans', 'gore', 'will', 'find', 'bits', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'cleavage', 'well', 'just', 'look', 'poster', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'lady', 'will', 'be', 'running', 'around', 'entirety', 'film', 'bra', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'best', 'support', 'actress', 'ironic', 'film', 'was', 'marketed', 'having', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'overtones', 'female', 'empowerment', 'leading', 'lady', 'will', 'spend', 'entirety', 'film', 'nearly', 'falling', 'slip', 'often', 'glistening', 'water', 'sweat', 'digress.All', 'told', 'enough', 'here', 'recommend', 'fans', 'recent', 'films', 'Captivity', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'remake', 'anyone', 'looking', 'really', 'deep', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'might', 'want', 'stay', 'ground', 'level']",P2 Theatrical Release

I think that the film overall would've worked better as a short as it feels like they just ran out of ideas halfway through. There's one kill in the film that is pretty gory but it happens early on and nothing else in the film reaches that level of gruesomeness. Some decent jump scares are present but nothing spectacular. All the cliches of the horror genre are here in their glory (dumb choices by the main character, bursting cleavage, the eventual retaliation scene, blood and guts, etc.) and like I said, this movie's main draw is its huge parking lot set, which admittedly is pretty creepy and could've been used to greater effect in a shorter film. Ah well, to be positive, I only said ""God, please end already"" about..... twice.The DVD has crisp picture and servicable surround sound. The featurettes provide a little bit of background info on the film but aren't particularly interesting. There is also a commentary track by the filmmakers.

1118771,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000YDMIN0,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 1]","Alexandre Aja has been someone I've kept my eye on ever since witnessing Haute Tension, a gripping film that ended up being a lot more than it seemed.  As such, when I heard he and his writing partner Gr&eacute;gory Levasseur were the writing force behind P2, I mentally filed it away as a possible film to see.  Unfortunately missed in the theatres, I'm glad to have finally found it...though it wasn't as terrific as I was hoping.Here we have a fairly typical setup of woman in duress.  In this particular case, our female protagonist is Angela, a corporate climber who's staying late on Christmas Eve.  When she finally does get ready to leave, of course her car (parked in the titular parking garage P2) won't start.  Add in a parking garage security officer who has less than a healthy interest in her and less than perfect mental health, and you have the gist of the movie.What helps elevate this movie above the average slasher/woman in duress horror film is the writing and the acting.  For one, the characters, for the most part, don't do stupid things.  Of course, a few things are going to occur like dropping the phones outside a gate, but on the whole, the characters create a rather convincing game of cat-and-mouse.  These type of films, if done right like in the French film Them, are exceptional studies in tension.  While P2 isn't as intense as it could be, it was still really enjoyable from this aspect.Additionally, Rachel Nichols and Wes Bentley help bring the characters to life.  Sometimes, the caricatures verge on self-parody but never cross the line.

1118772,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B000YDMIN0,TheBandit,"[1, 5]","""When did P1 come out?""That's the first thing everyone has asked when I said I watched ""P2"".  What a ridiculously unfortunate title.  It couldn't have helped at the box office, ""P2"" opened late last year on over 2,000 screens and wound up grossing less than 4 million bucks.But I'm not one to judge a movie by it's title.  I was mildly interested in the concept - being stuck in a multi-level parking garage while being pursued by a psycho - after seeing trailers for it.  I mean, it is a pretty good setting for a horror/thriller.  Problem is, the screenwriters didn't imagine much beyond that basic idea.Rachel Nichols - who I'd never seen or heard of before, but she brings to mind a younger Teri Polo - plays a woman leaving work on Christmas Eve to visit her family.  She gets to her car and finds that it won't start.  She asks the lot security guy - played by Wes Bentley - for help.  Turns out the guy has an unhealthy obsession with her, and a cat-and-mouse game ensues.I wish I could say there were some interesting twists along the way, but there simply aren't. This is about as threadbare a plot as you can get. Too bad, because I did like the lead actors.  Bentley makes for a very effective psycho.  Rachel Nichols is even better as the object of his obsession.  She doesn't do anything brilliant with the character, but given that the script didn't give her much to work with she manages to make an impression.  Maybe it was just the impressive cleavage on display throughout (check the cover art for an idea).

1118775,A7D607LPOKWYD,B000YDMIN0,TJ Brown,"[1, 1]","A good suspenseful thriller.  First off, in full disclosure, I would give a movie with Rachel Nichols simply standing around waiting for a bus 3 stars. Is why I took a gander at this seemingly formulaic flick in the first place. That said, the movie held up its end of the bargain and I had a good time with the watch, so I will bump it up a star.The stalker guy was one of those characters that will linger - of all the creeps running about in the movies I see this one will linger. Played well, added to the movie, not just a dummy with a dumb plan (even though he did indeed have a dumb plan) Even had a quip that had me laughing aloud, which came as a surprise. As with any movie in this genre (well, heck, any movie of any genre, it seems) there was a lot of lapses in logic, but movies are escape, even ones not about escape like this one is.A couple of deaths and some cringe worthy moments at that, but by all means not a splatterfest. Like the stalker in the film should be remembered once the credits roll, there are a couple of scenes that will linger as well. Thats a good thing. Even the ""Christmas""  motif fits. The only complaint I have is that by the end I was ready for it to end.  Running around in a dark parking garage gets long in the tooth after a while, and if the main character did not look like Rachel Nichols while doing so I may not have been so patient with it.Ending was predictable but fitting  (the back cover of the DVD pretty much gives it away as if we could not figure it out once we read the premise of the movie) and once it was done i considered it time well spent.  Oh, and also, it does not seem like the stalker guy thought this out very well...I have no idea what his end game would have been. Finally, that parking garage really needs to do better background checks.  I smell quite a lawsuit here. In conclusion, I would watch it again, I would recommend it to others, and I toast this one.",4,parking pandemonium,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1934,"['good', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'First', 'off', 'full', 'disclosure', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'simply', 'standing', 'around', 'waiting', 'bus', '3', 'stars', 'why', 'took', 'gander', 'seemingly', 'formulaic', 'flick', 'first', 'place', 'said', 'movie', 'held', 'up', 'end', 'bargain', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watch', 'will', 'bump', 'up', 'star.The', 'stalker', 'guy', 'was', 'one', 'characters', 'will', 'linger', 'creeps', 'running', 'about', 'movies', 'see', 'one', 'will', 'linger', 'Played', 'well', 'added', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'dummy', 'dumb', 'plan', 'even', 'did', 'indeed', 'have', 'dumb', 'plan', 'Even', 'had', 'quip', 'had', 'laughing', 'aloud', 'came', 'surprise', 'movie', 'genre', 'well', 'heck', 'movie', 'genre', 'was', 'lot', 'lapses', 'logic', 'movies', 'are', 'escape', 'even', 'ones', 'not', 'escape', 'one', 'is.A', 'couple', 'deaths', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'moments', 'means', 'not', 'splatterfest', 'stalker', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'once', 'credits', 'roll', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'will', 'linger', 'as', 'well', 'Thats', 'good', 'thing', 'Even', 'Christmas', 'motif', 'fits', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'end', 'was', 'ready', 'end', 'Running', 'around', 'dark', 'parking', 'garage', 'long', 'tooth', 'while', 'main', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'doing', 'so', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'patient', 'it.Ending', 'was', 'predictable', 'fitting', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'away', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'once', 'read', 'premise', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'i', 'considered', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'Oh', 'also', 'not', 'seem', 'stalker', 'guy', 'thought', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'end', 'game', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Finally', 'parking', 'garage', 'really', 'do', 'better', 'background', 'checks', 'smell', 'quite', 'lawsuit', 'here', 'conclusion', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'would', 'recommend', 'others', 'toast', 'one']",P2 Theatrical Release

Spoilers follow, so leave if you must.It's Christmas Eve in New York City, and Angela Bridges (Norris) is working late, trying to get a business deal wrapped up before she heads home for the holidays.  She finds that her car, parked at level P2 in the garage of her building, will not start.  Tom (Bentley), a security guard, is unable to help her, so Angela heads upstairs to catch a cab.  Unable to leave the building, she returns to the parking level where she is ambushed and rendered unconscious.She awakes in the security office, wearing a cocktail dress, and chained to a table, while Tom makes pleasant conversation over dinner about her plans for the holidays.  Also present is Tom's Rottweiler `Lucky'.  It quickly becomes clear that the security guard is delusional, and has had fantasies about Angela for some time.  His Christmas present to his guest is a video tape showing her co-worker Jim (Simon Reynolds), making an inappropriate pass at her in the building's elevator.Tom handcuffs Angela, and drives her down to a lower level where Jim is tied to a chair.  After beating him repeatedly with a flashlight, Tom crushes him against a wall with his car, killing him.  Angela manages to escape, and while the guard disposes of the body, she attempts to escape in the elevator.  When Tom cuts her off, she pulls the emergency stop button.  In a creative move, Tom uses a fire hose to flood the elevator car, and then dumps another surprise on Angela, that scares her back into hiding in the parking structure.Given the rather limited parameters of an underground parking structure, the film manages to maintain a fairly good level of suspense, focusing on Angela' attempts to evade Tom and his dog.  The only other characters in the second half, are a couple of cops who happen by.  The writing while definitely aiming to be dramatic, manages to avoid going completely over the top, at least until the very end, when the action ramps up.  Rachel Norris deserves major credit for her very strong performance, mostly accomplished while barefoot and wearing handcuffs. It's easy to slip into clich&eacute; when playing a psycho, but Wes Bentley manages not to cross too far into that area.  Little is known about the security guard, though he is apparently an Elvis fan, as for a little holiday cheer, he pipes Blue Christmas through the parking structure's sound system.The film's R rating is mostly for violence, as the team responsible for the 2006 Hill Have Eyes remake, Alexandre Aja, Greg Levasseur, and Franck Khalfoun, deliver a solid suspense thriller, without that much gore.  Putting Rachel Norris in a form fitting dress works well, and she frequently gets soaking wet, but the clothes stay on.  P2 is worth seeing if you are interested in something a little more stimulating than your average made for cable TV thriller.",3,way to ruin Christmas...,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,3037,"['plot', ""n't"", 'very', 'plausible', 'P2', '2007', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'attention', 'mostly', 'strong', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'Rachel', 'Norris', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'leave', 'must.It', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Angela', 'Bridges', 'Norris', 'working', 'late', 'trying', 'get', 'business', 'deal', 'wrapped', 'up', 'home', 'holidays', 'car', 'parked', 'level', 'P2', 'garage', 'building', 'will', 'not', 'start', 'Tom', 'Bentley', 'security', 'guard', 'unable', 'help', 'so', 'Angela', 'heads', 'upstairs', 'catch', 'cab', 'Unable', 'leave', 'building', 'parking', 'level', 'where', 'ambushed', 'rendered', 'unconscious.She', 'awakes', 'security', 'office', 'wearing', 'cocktail', 'dress', 'chained', 'table', 'Tom', 'pleasant', 'conversation', 'dinner', 'plans', 'holidays', 'Also', 'present', 'Tom', 'Rottweiler', 'Lucky', 'quickly', 'clear', 'security', 'guard', 'delusional', 'had', 'fantasies', 'Angela', 'time', 'Christmas', 'present', 'guest', 'video', 'tape', 'showing', 'co-worker', 'Jim', 'Simon', 'Reynolds', 'making', 'inappropriate', 'pass', 'building', 'elevator.Tom', 'handcuffs', 'Angela', 'down', 'lower', 'level', 'where', 'Jim', 'tied', 'chair', 'beating', 'repeatedly', 'flashlight', 'Tom', 'wall', 'car', 'killing', 'Angela', 'escape', 'guard', 'body', 'escape', 'elevator', 'When', 'Tom', 'off', 'emergency', 'stop', 'button', 'creative', 'move', 'Tom', 'fire', 'hose', 'flood', 'elevator', 'car', 'then', 'dumps', 'surprise', 'Angela', 'back', 'hiding', 'parking', 'rather', 'limited', 'parameters', 'underground', 'parking', 'structure', 'film', 'maintain', 'fairly', 'good', 'level', 'suspense', 'focusing', 'Angela', 'attempts', 'evade', 'Tom', 'dog', 'only', 'other', 'characters', 'second', 'half', 'are', 'couple', 'cops', 'who', 'happen', 'writing', 'definitely', 'aiming', 'be', 'dramatic', 'avoid', 'going', 'completely', 'top', 'least', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'action', 'up', 'Rachel', 'Norris', 'major', 'credit', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'mostly', 'accomplished', 'barefoot', 'wearing', 'handcuffs', 'easy', 'slip', 'clich', 'eacute', 'when', 'playing', 'psycho', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'not', 'cross', 'too', 'far', 'area', 'Little', 'known', 'security', 'guard', 'apparently', 'Elvis', 'fan', 'little', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'Blue', 'Christmas', 'parking', 'structure', 'sound', 'system.The', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'mostly', 'violence', 'team', 'responsible', '2006', 'Hill', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'remake', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'Greg', 'Levasseur', 'Franck', 'Khalfoun', 'deliver', 'solid', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'much', 'gore', 'Putting', 'Rachel', 'Norris', 'form', 'fitting', 'dress', 'works', 'well', 'frequently', 'soaking', 'wet', 'clothes', 'stay', 'P2', 'worth', 'seeing', 'are', 'interested', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'stimulating', 'average', 'made', 'cable', 'TV', 'thriller']",P2 Theatrical Release

She's also a serious workaholic who is single and, other than the security guards, finds herself as the last person in the building on Christmas Eve.  After calling her sister to let her know that she is finally on her way to the family Christmas party, Angela prepares to leave the building.  However, when she finally gets to her car on P2, it won't start.  Thomas (Wes Bentley) offers his assistance, but seems unable to get the car to started.  Thomas invites Angela to a Christmas dinner, but Angela is already late and turns down the offer.  However, as Angela soon learns, the offer really wasn't optional and Thomas was just being polite and nice.  Angela will share in his Christmas dinner whether she really wants to or not and maybe if she's nice and polite she might escape from P2 and get home for Christmas.Taking place almost completely in the confines of a parking garage (the movie was filmed exclusively at night in a real parking garage in Toronto), starring two relatively unknown actors, and a plot that is basically just a complex game of cat and mouse, there's a great deal about P2 that could have gone wrong.  Yet, the film actually works.  Since SCREAM, many suspense and horror films have taken themselves way too seriously and pretend that they have some great message to deliver, have a lot of ""allusions"" that you'll get if you're a film fan, or promise to bring the genre to the next level.  P2 doesn't have any allusions.  It knows that it is simply a horrific suspense film based around a film that many people, woman in particular, have actually had at one point in their lives.  Rachel Nicholas gives a great performance (and is quite nice on the eyes, too) and will probably be a top-tier actress in the next few years.  Wes Bentley is perhaps best known for his work in AMERICAN BEAUTY also gives a performance to solidify himself as a rising star, too (as long as he isn't type-cast as the psychotic villain).Overall, P2 is a suspense film that doesn't fail to deliver.",4,Not Too Shabby.,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,2149,"['Angela', 'Bridges', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'ambition', 'hardworking', 'quickly', 'rising', 'executive', 'branches', 'office', 'also', 'serious', 'workaholic', 'who', 'single', 'other', 'security', 'guards', 'last', 'person', 'building', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'calling', 'sister', 'let', 'know', 'finally', 'way', 'family', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Angela', 'leave', 'building', 'However', 'when', 'finally', 'car', 'P2', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'Thomas', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'assistance', 'unable', 'get', 'car', 'started', 'Thomas', 'Angela', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'Angela', 'already', 'late', 'down', 'offer', 'However', 'Angela', 'soon', 'offer', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'optional', 'Thomas', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'polite', 'nice', 'Angela', 'will', 'share', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'really', 'not', 'maybe', 'nice', 'polite', 'might', 'escape', 'P2', 'get', 'home', 'Christmas.Taking', 'place', 'almost', 'completely', 'confines', 'parking', 'garage', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'exclusively', 'night', 'real', 'parking', 'garage', 'Toronto', 'starring', 'two', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actors', 'plot', 'basically', 'just', 'complex', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'great', 'deal', 'P2', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'wrong', 'film', 'actually', 'SCREAM', 'many', 'suspense', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'taken', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'pretend', 'have', 'great', 'message', 'deliver', 'have', 'lot', 'allusions', ""'ll"", 'get', ""'re"", 'film', 'fan', 'promise', 'bring', 'genre', 'next', 'level', 'P2', ""n't"", 'have', 'allusions', 'simply', 'horrific', 'suspense', 'film', 'based', 'film', 'many', 'people', 'woman', 'particular', 'have', 'actually', 'had', 'one', 'point', 'lives', 'Rachel', 'Nicholas', 'great', 'performance', 'quite', 'nice', 'eyes', 'too', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'top-tier', 'actress', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'also', 'performance', 'solidify', 'rising', 'star', 'too', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'type-cast', 'psychotic', 'villain', '.Overall', 'P2', 'suspense', 'film', ""n't"", 'fail', 'deliver']",P2 Theatrical Release

And then  we all know how everything closes up by 5PM Christmas Eve for the holidays (everyone is home with friends and family).So tie all of this in together (a single female walking to her car, alone in an empty garage on Christmas Eve, car problems) then add in a creepy psychopath and you have the makings for a good horror film!I truly enjoyed this movie.  The realistic atmosphere, which I can easily see happening, along with much of what happens made it an all around good movie!I took one star off as I think the if the title was different (something catchy) the movie would of been a better seller.",4,"P2, a Holiday Horror Movie",1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,992,"['getting', 'P2', 'never', 'heard', 'Never', 'even', 'understood', 'how', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'named', 'P2', 'watching', 'P2', 'must', 'admit', 'movie', 'good', 'backdrop', 'Christmas/Holiday', 'season', 'one', 'love', 'movies', 'premise', 'feel', 'one', 'time', 'life', 'being', 'walking', 'car', 'night', 'alone', 'then', 'automobile', 'problems', 'then', 'know', 'how', 'everything', 'up', '5PM', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'holidays', 'everyone', 'home', 'friends', 'family', 'tie', 'together', 'single', 'female', 'walking', 'car', 'alone', 'empty', 'garage', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'car', 'problems', 'then', 'add', 'creepy', 'psychopath', 'have', 'makings', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'realistic', 'atmosphere', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'happening', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'around', 'good', 'movie', 'took', 'one', 'star', 'think', 'title', 'was', 'different', 'something', 'catchy', 'movie', 'would', 'been', 'better', 'seller']",P2 Theatrical Release

You won't see anything overly unique or original in this movie, but it IS actually a pretty well made film. The antagonist does his job quite well, and despite the.... obnoxiously over-endowed female lead, she too does a pretty fine performance. There are some decently 'disturbing'-ish moments and alright tension. To say the least, I had added this to my queue one night on a B-movie spree, but was pleasantly surprised with this one.",4,Review for P2 Movie,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,481,"['could', 'rate', '3.5', 'instead', 'would', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'overly', 'unique', 'original', 'movie', 'IS', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'antagonist', 'job', 'quite', 'well', 'obnoxiously', 'over-endowed', 'female', 'lead', 'too', 'pretty', 'fine', 'performance', 'are', 'decently', ""'disturbing'-ish"", 'moments', 'alright', 'tension', 'say', 'least', 'had', 'added', 'queue', 'one', 'night', 'B-movie', 'spree', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'one']",P2 Theatrical Release

Because it disturbed me to no end. Some folks say that the actor who played Thomas wasn't creepy enough, but I strongly disagree. The moment the Tom character is introduced, a general unease falls over the entire movie. You cannot help but squirm, wince, and turn away at the awkward and disturbing conversations he has with Angela (Rachel Nichols) who has just realized she has been kidnapped.He tries to come off as the friendly guy and it works so well in making his scenes that much more uncomfortable. However, I think the creepiest part to this film, is that the two characters are very relatable, including the psychopath.Let's start with Angela:If anyone has been a victim of a mugging or some unfortunate incident. You can easily relate to being the victim. Her reactions to his advances are believable and are what I think a normal, untrained civilian would do under the circumstances. She was pretty much defenseless and handcuffed for 90% of the movie, which to me, gives this woman a BAD ASS seal of approval, because she manages to hold her own without being able to really defend herself.But let's talk about the really disturbing fellow, Tom.The reason Tom is so awkward to watch, is that he is a reflection of a person who has lost his sanity from loneliness. Though none of you sane viewers would do what he did, I can easily see his actions as the dark side of the human psyche. Sure, people will say he's crazy and psychotic, and he is. But he was driven to that point by constantly being lonely. He watched people in a security camera, at his crummy job, with his crummy car, and watches everyone go home to families. They're happy, they have companions, they're not SINGLE. I get the sense that Tom wasn't always crazy, that he just one day saw this girl Angela in the security cam, and over time... just became infatuated with her.That infatuation led to madness, and eventually to his extreme behavior. I think anyone who has experienced loneliness, can see how he went crazy. Isolation is a very powerful motive, humans are social animals and need someone to interact with, we're wired that way. So when time keeps going by where you're not able to make that human connection, it's liable to make anyone crazy, and that's the horrifying part.If you really want your skin to crawl, I can't see why you wouldn't watch this movie. Though be warned, if you see a part of yourself in Tom, just remember...it's only a movie.",4,"Creepy, Disturbing, Unsettling, and all too familiar.",1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,2626,"['Let', 'get', 'usual', 'way.Yes', 'concept', 'been', 'done', 'predictable.Yes', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'probably', 'done', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie.Why', 'disturbed', 'end', 'folks', 'say', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Thomas', 'was', ""n't"", 'creepy', 'enough', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'moment', 'Tom', 'character', 'introduced', 'general', 'unease', 'entire', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'squirm', 'wince', 'turn', 'away', 'awkward', 'disturbing', 'conversations', 'Angela', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'who', 'just', 'realized', 'been', 'kidnapped.He', 'tries', 'come', 'off', 'friendly', 'guy', 'so', 'well', 'making', 'scenes', 'much', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'However', 'think', 'creepiest', 'part', 'film', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'relatable', 'including', 'psychopath.Let', 'start', 'Angela', 'anyone', 'been', 'victim', 'mugging', 'unfortunate', 'incident', 'can', 'easily', 'relate', 'being', 'victim', 'reactions', 'advances', 'are', 'believable', 'are', 'what', 'think', 'normal', 'untrained', 'civilian', 'would', 'do', 'circumstances', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'defenseless', 'handcuffed', '90', '%', 'movie', 'woman', 'BAD', 'ASS', 'seal', 'approval', 'hold', 'own', 'being', 'able', 'really', 'defend', 'herself.But', 'let', 'talk', 'really', 'disturbing', 'fellow', 'Tom.The', 'reason', 'Tom', 'so', 'awkward', 'watch', 'reflection', 'person', 'who', 'lost', 'sanity', 'loneliness', 'none', 'sane', 'viewers', 'would', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'actions', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'psyche', 'Sure', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'crazy', 'psychotic', 'was', 'driven', 'point', 'constantly', 'being', 'lonely', 'watched', 'people', 'security', 'camera', 'crummy', 'job', 'crummy', 'car', 'watches', 'everyone', 'go', 'home', 'families', ""'re"", 'happy', 'have', 'companions', ""'re"", 'not', 'SINGLE', 'get', 'sense', 'Tom', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'crazy', 'just', 'one', 'day', 'saw', 'girl', 'Angela', 'security', 'cam', 'time', 'just', 'became', 'infatuated', 'infatuation', 'led', 'madness', 'eventually', 'extreme', 'behavior', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'experienced', 'loneliness', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'went', 'crazy', 'Isolation', 'very', 'powerful', 'motive', 'humans', 'are', 'social', 'animals', 'need', 'someone', 'interact', ""'re"", 'wired', 'way', 'So', 'when', 'time', 'going', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'able', 'make', 'human', 'connection', 'liable', 'make', 'anyone', 'crazy', 'horrifying', 'part.If', 'really', 'want', 'skin', 'crawl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'be', 'warned', 'see', 'part', 'yourself', 'Tom', 'just', 'remember', 'only', 'movie']",P2 Theatrical Release
