701969,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000067D0Y,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 7]","One of the most powerful speeches witnessed in this film are those by Laura Linney, who tries to create a similarity between the death of Matthew Shepard and the accidental death of a Wyoming State Trooper that same night.  It does create a moment of thought in your mind that links the power of the death of Shepard to that of the power of the media, but it is just for a fleeting moment as we are whisked back into another voice, with another opinion.  That voice is both the strength and weakness of this film.  As a viewer, new to this story and type of storytelling, I felt a bit over biased.  I realize that instead of focusing on the death and life of Matthew Shepard, Kaufman, focused on the collective voice of the town, which was nothing but a bag of mixed messages.  As I sat, thinking about this film over the course of several days, that is the only issue that I had trouble grappling.  This was an emotional film, chalk full of actors giving surprising monologues about their personal opinions as we collectively watch the aftermath of such a horrid crime.  We even get the chance to see how the death of Matthew Shepard caused an ill fate to another person within the community.  Again, these side stories were powerful to watch because it gave a living soul to the town, but where The Laramie Project went a bit too far was the over-dramatic nature of the characters.While I would agree that there was probably some emotion behind those that chose to take part in the interviews, I don't believe you would find such a doctor, with such a dramatic ""umph"" saying, ""We take offense to this murder"", like no other than Peter Fonda could say it.  Christina Ricci, in my eyes, was the embodiment of my last statement.  Perhaps Kaufman, would have benefited more by placing unknowns in the roles instead of these name Hollywood players.  While they were not A-grade actors, they each did a phenomenal job in this film - but oddly, this was the problem.  Steve Buscemi speaking about his relationship with Shepard made me see Buscemi being Buscemi.  I didn't see the character that he was playing.  I didn't see Fonda's doctor's character.  I didn't see anything of value behind Ricci's character (outside of a definite Ricci being Ricci) - and while I realize that this was not a work of fiction, without the development of a known character, they were just actors speaking powerful lines.  The lines stood on their own, and it was those lines that continued my attention through the film.  Alas, I could not see Joshua Jackson (from Dawson's Creek) as the actual bartender or Dylan Baker as the head of the hospital because I knew these actors.  I wanted better from them.  The most emotional speeches came from those that I was not fully familiar with.  Those like the man who watched the parade route, or the actor that played Matthew Shepard's father.  These smaller, unknown bits, was what made The Laramie Project stand out and break a tear out of even the strongest wall.I want to express again that I thought that this was a very powerful film; there were just certain moments that were using clich&eacute; elements to heighten the emotion of the story.  This wasn't needed in the least bit.  While I know that having the media attention when the residents of Laramie walked out of the courtroom was surprising, the film technique used to demonstrate this seemed cheap, and nearly like a low blow to the story.  The glossed effect of when Ricci's character, and her mother, made angels to block the words of protestors, seemed fake on screen - while perhaps actual footage of this event would have strengthened the emotion.  Perhaps I am asking too much, but when Ricci walks out with those angel wings flying high, I just expected Will Smith to come out of nowhere, screaming a line that would surely demonstrate to those protestors who was in control here.  It came out a bit too Hollywood.  As well as the scene where Dylan Baker cries, which I felt was the better of all the cinematic moments.  It was powerful, yet subdued.  It could have used more realism.  Am I complaining too much?  Nope, because I thought this was a brilliant film with how unique it was with its portrait of storytelling.  I liked hearing the voices, in fact, if this were a story on CD, it would be a personal favorite, but because we were distracted by images of famous actors speaking in their own voice as well as unclimactic clich&eacute; scenes, it softened the blow.  I was still teary at the end, but this could have been a film to rival that of Angels in America had it just tried a bit harder to avoid the Hollywood influx and paint a more vivid portrait of your average American town.Overall, I must admit, it took me several days for this film to settle, but I think I could view it again.  I especially would like to see Amy Madigan's performance, which I thought, her struggle with what happened, nearly overshadowed what happened to Matthew Shepard.  I could have watched an entire film based solely on her.  It is amazing what the media chooses to cover, and what they choose to ignore.  I like what this film demonstrated.  I like that it didn't depict this Wyoming town of rednecks and hillbillies never quite understanding what was wrong with the murder of Shepard.  I am glad that we were able to see humanity break through the barriers and show emotion, show sadness, and look beyond the lifestyle to see the human being that was wrongly sentenced.  I do think, nonetheless, that liberties were taken with certain actors and certain camera shots, but overall that can be overlooked.  By throwing in some unknowns to this picture, I think the drama and the intensity of the event could have been heightened.  This is a sad thing that happened, and I am glad that Hollywood chose to open the envelope, but they just didn't give it that final seal of approval.  Actors were actors and clich&eacute; moments were used to build emotion.  You already had a sad story; we didn't need the charades to improve it.  I strongly suggest watching this film, if anything, to see that there is compassion within a town burdened with such a horrific crime.  It is sad, and will surely bring a tear to anyone's eye.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Everyone Carries a Piece of the Truth.,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,6238,"['One', 'most', 'powerful', 'speeches',

FAMOUS actors and actresses might I add.  I must have recognized at least 6 different people starring in the film.The storytelling does gradually improve after the first 30 minutes, and the ending segment is the one that shocks me the most because it's about the murdered victims father inside a courtroom giving an honest and emotional speech, and I've never heard a speech move me quite *this* hard.The people who killed the boy show just heartless they truly are, so the film will probably spend quite a lot of time surprising and shocking you.  You just don't expect people to reach a level of hatred *this* extreme, however it's true, since this terrible murder is based on a true story that really did happen over 10 years ago.Expect to see a movie dominated with a bunch of interviews involving actors playing the roles of the victims friends and family and several people around town.

701979,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B000067D0Y,David Anderson,"[4, 5]","The Emmy and Golden Globe nominated &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; is a powerful film that originally aired in October, 2001.  Its deep words and theme have the intensity to keep audiences watching every scene closely.  This true story educates people on why hate is not a human virtue and what society can do to stop it.  The story of what happened to Matthew Shephard on October 7, 1998 is slowly told by people in the town of Laramie, where the murder happened.  Five people from New York City interview 200 town citizens searching for the truth.  However, the film isn't about his murder; this is about Laramie, Wyoming.  The writers brilliantly distinguish the plot.  Every character interviewed has their own view of homosexuality and homophobia.  Their words, especially the homophobic ones, are shocking.  Meanwhile, their stories take audiences to the events as they were occurring between October 7-12, 1998, Shephard's funeral, and the court dates for his killers.  Every raw emotion has the realisms that asides this film from many others.  The unique camera effects wonderfully desplict the ugliness and fear of the horrifying events.  The real news clips are great necessities that prove how real it is.  Every member of the large acting cast performed their role beautifully: Oscar nominees Peter Fonda and Laura Linney, Camryn Manheim, Christina Ricci, Clea DuVall, Joshua Jackson, Ben Foster, Steve Buscemi, Janeane Garofalo, and more.  Every actor added their own sense of theme into the film, enlightening or discouraging.  Such film quality makes &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; worth watching many times.

The movie does a wonderful job showing both sides of the story. At one point, one of the interviewers breaks down for letting someone say something very blatantly and hurtfully anti-gay, but I admire her courage and that of her coworkers for traveling down from NYC to Laramie, Wyoming and to interview some extremely homophobic people.  The Reverend Phelps makes an appearance that is absolutely sickening in the movie as well.  How people can honestly thank God for AIDS because it kills homosexuals is disguisting to me, and there was a very touching scene revolving around Phelp's attendance and the pain a friend of Shepard feels and what she does about it.  I was first introduced to this story at my school's GSA, but I still remember the vigils held for him in Ft. Collins and around the country.

Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 6]","Matthew Shepard was about two months short of his twenty-second birth when he was robbed, beaten, tied to a fence post and left to die in a rural area of Wyoming.  The man who found him at first thought he was a scarecrow.  Rushed to Poudre Valley Hospital at Fort Collins, he died on 12 October 1998--and when Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney were arrested for the crime they resorted to a defense known as ""gay panic.""  Matthew Shepherd had propositioned them, they said, and they were so horrified that they killed him in response.The gay community and numerous civil rights watchdog groups were outraged by the defense, and as more and more facts came to light it seemed that the crime was somewhat more complicated than Henderson and McKinney wanted the public to know.  Witnesses stated that Henderson and McKinney had specifically targeted Shepherd because he was gay.  After much legal wrangling, Henderson pled guilty and testified against McKinney, who was convicted; after still more legal wrangling, and at the request of Shepherd's parents, McKinney escaped the death penalty but has no chance of parole.The case made headlines from end of the United States to the other and prompted numerous calls for Hate Crimes legislation, which had long been stalled both at the state and federal level.  And in the midst of the confusion, chaos, and controversy, Moises Kaufman and the members of The Tectonic Theatre Project arrived on the scene, interviewing more than two hundred people about their thoughts and feelings on the case.  These were shaped into THE LARAMIE PROJECT, a drama that debuted in 2000 and which has since shocked, impressed, and deeply moved audiences from coast to coast.On the stage, THE LARAMIE PROJECT is played by eight performers who enact the numerous interview subjects in a three act, three hour performance on a largely bare stage.  When filmed by HBO in 2002, it was reduced in length by about half and each interview subject was performed by a different actor--some of them members of the Techtonic Theatre Project, some of them well-known actors such as Laura Linney and Peter Fonda.  The result is indeed powerful... but not as effective as the stage version, for on film it tends be a series of readings by ""talking heads,"" a sort of pseudo-documentary, rather than as a cohesive whole.That said, the great difference between the film and the original script is one of balance.  On stage, THE LARAMIE PROJECT takes no sides per se; it simply sets forth the words and allows the audience to judge.  On screen, it is distinctly slanted, cutting much of the conservative commentary that gave the original such remarkable balance.  Even so, and although far outstripped by the stage version, it is a powerful voice for equality, tolerance, and simple human decency.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[8, 10]","This HBO adaptation of Moises Kaufman's play by the same name reminds of us just how important pay-for-viewing television is in this country. Based on interviews Mr. Kaufman and others conducted with the locals in Laramie, Wyoming after the tragic murder of Matthew Shepard in October, 1998, this film is a sad commentary on what can happen when anyone condones hatred, either by his actions or inactions.Mr. Kaufman has gathered a stellar cast of actors: Steve Buscemi, Laura Linney, Janeane Garofalo, Christina Ricci, Peter Fonda, Camryn Manheim et al, all of whom give fantastic performances in their portrayal of Laramie locals. On the other hand, it would take a bad actor indeed who could not get into these roles. Terry Kinney as Dennis Shepard, Matthew's father, gives a stunning performance as he makes a courtroom speech asking for mercy for Aaron McKinney, one of the two men who kidnapped and killed Matthew. If you don't tear up during his speech, you have been dead for several months already. (Mr. Shepard, by the way, is a far better person than I am. I do not believe I would have asked that McKinney be given a chance to live.)The play is much longer than the film version and in some ways works better. For example, we get more than a glimpse of the locals and thus are able to see how some of them actually change for the better during this horrendous time for this town of less than 30,000 people. Also, I noticed in the play that the Baptist minister is not named while ministers of other churches are, an interesting touch.In commentary accompanying the film on the DVD, Camryn Manheim-- one of my favorite actresses-- says that this film IS about Laramie. I wish that she were right although I fear that the same climate that produced the killers, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, exists in countless other towns across this country. Not every gay twenty-one-year-old gets to live in Boston or New York or San Francisco.There are glimmers of hope, however. Some people change; others, though not necessarily homophobic, are made aware of the problems that young gay people face. Some gay people become more active-- there is a moving scene where gay people and others dressed in white sheets are able to completely cover up and practically shut out the hate-filled shouts of Phelps, whom I will not dignify by calling ""Reverend."" Finally, one character-- I believe it is the hospital administrator-- admonishes parents: ""go home and give your kids a hug.""

The desperate helplessness felt by the town (and the world) as they wait to hear of Matt Shephard's fate is keenly played and the absolute devastation felt by so many after Matt's death is even more apparent through the performances of this incredible cast.  Some reviewers have critiqued this film for agenda-pushing, but it's important to remember that Moises Kaufman IS a liberal, gay, New York playwright.  Sure, the film takes a stance on the murder and definitely dismisses the arguments that Matt shouldn't have been in a bar or ""hitting on"" straight men or that he was a promiscuous person who had already gotten himself into trouble with his lifestyle before.  However, I think that the more conservative viewpoints of others are considered, and, at the very least, included.  It is also true that Matthew Shephard became larger than life because of his death and that the murders of many other minorities (racial, ethnic, religious) do not get the kind of press as Matt did.  However, I think it is completely unfair to dismiss the impact of this death and this film simply because others have not taken up the same project for other victims.

701993,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B000067D0Y,Libretio,"[10, 13]","THE LARAMIE PROJECT(USA - 2002)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalFollowing the murder of Matthew Shepard by a couple of homophobic thugs in the nondescript town of Laramie, Wyoming, a theater troupe descends on the area and questions residents, politicians, doctors and police officers in an effort to probe the circumstances which led to this appalling crime.When 21 year old Matthew Shepard was murdered by Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney in October 1998, it seemed like the culmination of a ceaseless conservative crusade against the so-called 'gay lifestyle' (whatever that means). For some, Matthew's death had been facilitated by the ongoing propagation of hatred which flourishes unchecked in every aspect of our daily lives, and which found its ultimate grim expression in the beating, torture and near-crucifixion of a virtually defenseless gay man. The killing prompted a national outpouring of grief and anger, fuelled by a media campaign that seemed more concerned with gaining mileage from a juicy story than challenging the attitudes which had given rise to this event in the first place. THE LARAMIE PROJECT - which began life as a stageplay created by the Tectonic Theater Project in New York, using the actual words of Laramie residents instead of 'dialogue' - attempts to redress the balance by probing the causes and consequences of bigotry, and the deep-rooted feelings of those most affected by the murder. It's a heartfelt debut from Tectonic founder and artistic director Moises Kaufman.Interviewees include friends and colleagues of Matthew, the investigating police officers, the doctors who cared for him during the coma which preceded his death, and those whose religious convictions appear to have clouded their judgment and humanity (in one appalling sequence, a mealy-mouthed reverend [Michael Emerson] expresses sympathy for the victim, whilst simultaneously hoping that Matthew spent his last conscious moments reflecting on his 'lifestyle'). Presented in mock-documentary format, in which the 'characters' are portrayed by an all-star cast of familiar faces (including Steve Buscemi, Amy Madigan, Laura Linney, Christina Ricci and Frances Sternhagen, amongst many others), Kaufman's film offers a platform to those on both sides of the debate, though the filmmakers' own liberal outlook is plainly obvious throughout. But, in taking a stand against fundamentalist attitudes, THE LARAMIE PROJECT seeks to demonstrate the flaws in extremist viewpoints. In other words, those with bigoted opinions are given enough rope to hang themselves, and some of them leap head-first into the noose. Thankfully, Fred Phelps and his satanic crew - who rubbed salt into a festering wound by protesting against 'fags' during Matthew's funeral - are reduced to little more than an unwelcome guest appearance, during which they're confronted by a host of silent, accusing townsfolk dressed as angels...Reluctant to shrink from uncomfortable truths, the film is not afraid to tackle the thorny issue of Matthew's HIV status and the small - but significant - part it played during the fall-out from this terrible event (notably, the devastating consequences for one of the police officers who was first to arrive at the scene of the crime), but that hasn't prevented some critics from questioning the film's 'narrow' liberal viewpoint. For instance, is homophobia and AIDS more deserving of such a high-profile movie than any number of similar social ills? No, but no one ever complained about high-profile movies which (quite rightly) denounce racism! And while prominent actors may not be lining up to star in powerful dramas about cancer (for example), those afflicted by cancer are hardly likely to encounter discrimination at state and governmental level because of their 'lifestyle choices', with little more than begrudging tolerance for their medical welfare.Secondly, the film is accused in some quarters of being a patronising diatribe, in which a bunch of 'backwoods hicks' are taught the error of their ways by 'omniscient and enlightened Californians' (as one skeptical Internet reviewer has complained). Only the townspeople themselves can confirm or deny this particular accusation, though the Tectonic Theater Project mounted a special performance of the stageplay in Laramie itself which didn't seem to generate any controversy. Other questions are not so easy to dismiss: Was the country really so outraged by Matthew's death, or was the controversy generated by little more than a media frenzy? After all, despite the platitudes expressed at the time, little has changed in the intervening years with regards to hate crimes legislation. In some ways, this is hardly surprising, since most politicians find it expedient to pacify an alignment of fanatical religious bigots. If nothing else, THE LARAMIE PROJECT reminds us to guard against prejudice and hatred wherever it manifests itself, to derive inspiration from the likes of Matthew Shepard, and - most importantly - to honor the fallen.As a film, 'Laramie' (which opened the Sundance Film Festival in 2002) is an impressive achievement; Kaufman has brought his considerable skills as a theater director to bear on a much broader cinematic canvas. It's mostly talking heads, of course, but there's an urgency in the telling which might have been lost in a straightforward documentary presentation. Ultra-professional in all departments, and acted with conviction by a sterling cast, the movie is thought-provoking and poignant, and inspires confidence that all is not lost in the battle against ignorance.",3,Sober exploration of bigotry and hatred,1079568000,"03 18, 2004",2004,5617,"['LARAMIE', 'PROJECT', 'USA', '2002', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'Dolby',

701994,ASSKHS3FV3J0H,B000067D0Y,"Lillian Patterson ""Post-Postmodern Angster""","[89, 103]","Perhaps you have to have some prior knowledge of the subject matter of this film in order to properly appreciate it.  ...  I don't think so, but maybe I'm wrong.  As a person, a human being, hearing the words of actual human beings who are trying to sort through their feelings after a tragedy, I would have been moved had I known nothing of the death of Matthew Shepard (as it is, I knew very little before viewing this movie).What initially attracted me to this film was the fact that it was an HBO production, and I've seen several quality HBO productions in the past.  I'd heard a little about the Matthew Shepard case, and I wanted to know more.  So I saw the film.First, this film isn't really a documentary-it's a dramatazation of interviews and conversations that members of a New York theatre troupe conducted with citizens of Laramie, Wyoming  These interviews served as the basis for the play ""The Laramie Project.""  It's a little distracting at first, because the film is shot in documentary-style and yet the people who are supposed to be citizens of the town are recognizable actors and actresses (such as Steve Buscemi and Christina Ricci).  And I wondered how much of the dialogue was real and how much was fictional.  But once I got over those concerns, I became engrossed in the story (after all, movies are fiction anyway).  And what a story.  For those who don't know, Matthew Shepard was a 21 year old college student who was brutally beaten and left for dead in Laramie, Wyoming in 1998.  The young men who attacked him were Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney.  Shepard was in a coma for a week before he died on October 12, 1998.  Shepard was [homosexual], and his killers claimed that he'd made passes at them, and so they decided to drive him to the edge of town, tie him up, and beat him.  To teach him a lesson.Whether Shepard learned his lesson or not is unknown, since he died soon after the attack.  But the citizens of Laramie sure seem to be learning something, and they want to talk about it.  The townspeople who were interviewed are a mix of [homosexual] residents, college professors, college students, and outraged citizens.  The young man who found Matthew Shepard, the Police Officer who was the first on the scene, a friend of Shepard's named Romaine, and a local Catholic Priest are standouts.  The emotions run the gamut from young people trying to reconcile what they've always been taught (that homosexuality is wrong) with the message that it's just another lifestyle choice, to others who believe that no one deserves to be beaten that way-but hey, Shepard shouldn't have been hitting on those young men...A local pastor prays that Shepard had time in the last moments of his life to repent and turn to Christ, a local Priest calls citizens together for a candlelight vigil, and all the while the members of the theatre troupe record the reactions of the townspeople as they themselves are touched and changed by what they see.Here we have people talking, people yelling, people laughing, people crying.  Everyone has been affected in one way or another by the tragedy, and what they say as they struggle to put their feelings into words (and the emotions that are so compellingly portrayed by the actors and actresses here) make for a startling portrayal of human emotion.  The story is told not just through words but through music, through facial expressions, through moments of silence that no words can fill.  Part character study, part ""documentary,"" part ""message film,"" ""The Laramie Project"" succeeds as excellent storytelling.  In a word: Haunting.  Apparently, it's not for everyone.

Matthew, a young man that was living in Laramie and that happened to be gay, was a victim, and became a symbol. But as another reviewer pointed out, he was first and foremost a human being that deserved to live.Matthew died due to the injuries received in what was defined as a hate crime. He was gay, and two men took exception to it, beating him up and leaving him tied to a fence. The man that discovered him the following day thought at first he was a scarecrow. He was so disfigured that he just didn't seem a person any more. Matthew was taken to a hospital, where he stayed in a comma until he died, a week later.The interviews allow us to witness what the people of Laramie were thinking regarding this event, something closely linked to their views on religion, homosexuality, tolerance and a lot more.  One character said something that made a big impact on me, and that explains a lot: ""I guess I didn't understand the magnitude with which some people hate"".On the whole, I think this is an excellent film, and I am sorry I didn't watch it before.

701999,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B000067D0Y,One More Option,"[1, 2]","This script is arranged from actual interview comments of the people of Laramie, Wyoming.  Laramie is a place where two young local residents brutally beat and killed a young gay man, leaving him for dead for 18 hours before his comatose body was found.  ""We don't grow children like that here . . . well, it's pretty clear we do.""  The script comes from their words, making the movie revealing and educational.The idea that kept recurring as I watched this film was how this event would have easily been forgetten in the greater cultural memory if this movie had not been made.  And I was also impressed how clueless and stupid so many of the people of Laramie were without knowing how stupid they were.  I'm not throwing stones at them, because I have been far more stupid in my past than they appeared to be.  But it is just embarrassing watching them reveal their consistent hate and ignorance, still unaware of their stupidity.  I don't use the word ""stupid"" often, because it is a word that for me is as bad as most profanity, but it is appropriate here.This movie reveals tragedies that are very relevant to today's audience because I live in a state where homosexuals are being treated as second class citizens by the legislature and the general public.  We're one of 8 states with popular vote initiatives this year to change the laws so that homosexual relationships are statutorily not given full protections or validation.  According to the Assoc. Press, ""Constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage have passed in all 20 states where they appeared on the ballot . . . passed overwhelmingly, ranging from a high of 86 percent in favor in Mississippi to Oregon's 57 percent, the slimmest margin in the country. Experts say . . . lawmakers feel only benefits and no backlash.""  Sadly, gays are still being discarded from first class protections & rights through legal and majority-sanctioned means.These actors and filmmakers chose not to be silent.  I appreciated Jonathan Lapin's comment in his review below - ""closets kill"".  Every time society creates a legal definition that creates a ""less than ideal"" class of people, there is an implicit authorization to treat those people with less than full rights and privileges.Additionally, when someone has to hide something they love or something that defines them, it can intrinsicially create negative health effects on that person, even in the absence of notorious mistreatment by others.  When someone has to hide and implode so many things that feel true to them, then those self-closeting and self-silencing actions can manifest themselves in both physical and mental disorders.  When something so core to their personal definition is discouraged by everyone around them, that can cause an otherwise good person to shutdown in negative ways.Of the deceased gay man, Matthew Shepard, his parents released these words upon notice of his death, ""Like a good son, he was caring to the end, and removed guilt and stress from the family.""  Do what you can to help remove feelings of unwarranted guilt.  Help the gay and bisexual people around you overcome any false guilt feelings they may still have.  ""You must tell your story,"" the movie says.  And I praise the filmmakers for telling this young man's story for future generations to continue to remember.",4,Don't Be Ashamed of Your Personal Story,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,3325,"['script', 'arranged', 'actual', 'interview', 'comments', 'people', 'Laramie', 'Wyoming', 'Laramie', 'place', 'where', 'two', 'young', 'local', 'residents', 'brutally', 'beat', 'killed', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'leaving', 'dead', '18', 'hours', 'comatose', 'body', 'was', 'found', 'do', ""n't"", 'grow', 'children', 'here', 'well', 'pretty', 'clear', 'do', 'script', 'words', 'making', 'movie', 'revealing', 'educational.The', 'idea', 'kept', 'recurring', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'event', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'forgetten', 'greater', 'cultural', 'memory', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'made', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'how', 'clueless', 'stupid', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Laramie', 'were', 'knowing', 'how', 'stupid', 'were', ""'m"", 'not', 'throwing', 'stones', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'stupid', 'past', 'appeared', 'be', 'just', 'embarrassing', 'watching', 'reveal', 'consistent', 'hate', 'ignorance', 'still', 'unaware', 'stupidity', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'word', 'stupid', 'often', 'word', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'profanity', 'appropriate', 'here.This', 'movie', 'reveals', 'tragedies', 'are', 'very', 'relevant', 'today', 'audience', 'live', 'state', 'where', 'homosexuals', 'are', 'being', 'treated', 'second', 'class', 'citizens', 'legislature', 'general', 'public', ""'re"", 'one', '8', 'states', 'popular', 'vote', 'initiatives', 'year', 'change', 'laws', 'homosexual', 'relationships', 'are', 'statutorily', 'not', 'given', 'full', 'protections', 'validation', 'According', 'Assoc', 'Press', 'Constitutional', 'amendments', 'banning', 'same-sex', 'marriage', 'have', 'passed', '20', 'states', 'where', 'appeared', 'ballot', 'passed', 'overwhelmingly', 'ranging', 'high', '86', 'percent', 'favor', 'Mississippi', 'Oregon', '57', 'percent', 'slimmest', 'margin', 'country', 'Experts', 'say', 'lawmakers', 'feel', 'only', 'benefits', 'backlash', 'Sadly', 'gays', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'discarded', 'first', 'class', 'protections', 'rights', 'legal', 'majority-sanctioned', 'means.These', 'actors', 'filmmakers', 'chose', 'not', 'be', 'silent', 'appreciated', 'Jonathan', 'Lapin', 'comment', 'review', 'closets', 'kill', 'time', 'society', 'legal', 'definition', 'less', 'ideal', 'class', 'people', 'implicit', 'authorization', 'treat', 'people', 'less', 'full', 'rights', 'privileges.Additionally', 'when', 'someone', 'hide', 'something', 'love', 'something', 'can', 'intrinsicially', 'create', 'negative', 'health', 'effects', 'person', 'even', 'absence', 'notorious', 'mistreatment', 'others', 'When', 'someone', 'hide', 'implode', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'feel', 'true', 'then', 'self-closeting', 'self-silencing', 'actions', 'can', 'manifest', 'physical', 'mental', 'disorders', 'When', 'something', 'so', 'core', 'personal', 'definition', 'discouraged', 'everyone', 'can', 'cause', 'otherwise', 'good', 'person', 'shutdown', 'negative', 'ways.Of', 'deceased', 'gay', 'man', 'Matthew', 'Shepard', 'parents', 'released', 'words', 'notice', 'death', 'good', 'son', 'was', 'caring', 'end', 'removed', 'guilt', 'stress', 'family', 'Do', 'what', 'can', 'help', 'remove', 'feelings', 'unwarranted', 'guilt', 'Help', 'gay', 'bisexual', 'people', 'overcome', 'false', 'guilt', 'feelings', 'may', 'still', 'have', 'must', 'tell', 'story', 'movie', 'praise', 'filmmakers', 'telling', 'young', 'man', 'story', 'future', 'generations', 'continue', 'remember']",N/A

The reactions from townspeople in Laramie were no doubt honest - regardless of which side they came down on in right/wrong of certain individuals. Laura Linney, Tom Bower, Amy Madigan and Lois Brown were real stand-outs in portraying these feelings.Though I thought Steve Buscemi, Christina Ricca and Janeane Garafalo did fine jobs - there was nothing stellar about their performances.

I could have seen the stage version of this piece, as I was in New York when it was playing, but was too afraid (for the same reason, I haven't seen Boys Don't Cry). And this apparently truncated HBO version is a very tough film to watch.It's excellent despite limitations imposed, we may assume, by the complex finances of TV. The cast is uniformly fine - I especially loved Margo Martindale, Terry Kinney (who would have given a shattering reading of Mr. Dennis Shepard's complete courtroom speech), Dylan Baker, Laura Linney, Amy Madigan and Frances Sternhagen, but everyone just GAVE so much! (I know other reviewers have carped about some of the performances, and I think it's worth pointing out that these actors donated their services to this project.)The people of Wyoming are not treated patronizingly - the film contains, in fact, a thinly veiled indictment of the 1998 media which did sometimes treat these people as hicks. And the script, of course, is based on transcripts from interviews with these people, and like interviews with anyone, there are idiosyncracies and lapses in grammar. Of course there are rednecks - as there are in Los Angeles or even Manhattan. But the citizens of Laramie overwhelmingly recoil from this senseless tragedy, and the most horrifying character - aside from the killers, and maybe even more than them - is ""Reverend"" Fred Phelps, as he was at the time - and he's an outsider.One person is conspicuously absent from this film, and that is Matthew Shepard. The Laramie Project is about the reaction of citizens to the brutality of his murder and the response of that city to the influx of international media attention.During the past five years, Dennis and Judy Shepard have done incredible work to help stamp out hate crimes everywhere, and we all owe them immeasurable respect and compassion. But I bet they'd give it up in a fraction of a second to have their son back for even one hour.As a member of the so-called gay community, I have always felt uneasy with this tendency - and the movie contributes to it - to treat Matthew Shepard primarily as a symbol and a martyr.
