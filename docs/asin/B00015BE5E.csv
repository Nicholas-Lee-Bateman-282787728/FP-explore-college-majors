793317,AR7PMKAE1I3T8,B00015BE5E,"Juan Sanchez ""Juan""","[4, 4]","This kind of DVDs makes me envy British and all lucky people which are able to watch live and direct this showman... I'm sure he's the best nowadays.In only one word: INCREDIBLE. Robbie really rocks. This concert is the prove that some artist were born to sing nice songs and other ones to make people go crazy. This show is not only Robbie's performance, but it's also the band, chorus, the stage, those beautiful dancers (Kate & Nikky: What a HOT, HOT Girls!!!).I bought this DVD some months ago and I didn't know which songs were included on this. When I saw it, the first thing I liked was the great interactive menu. That's a really good job. Not only for the animations and images, but the sound and background songs. So, at first sight: 5/5Then, the track list. there are almost all Robbie Williams greatest songs. But I regreted two missing: ""MILLENNIUM"" and ""SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL"" (not played in the concert). But after watching this concert I got satisfied. The order of these songs are really nice, starting with ""LET ME ENTERTAIN YOU"", ""WE WILL ROCK YOU"" and going to a wondeful ""MONSOON"". A quieter part of the show comes with ""SHE'S THE ONE"", but it contrast with inmediately played ""SUPREME"". ""KIDS"" and ""HOT FUSGE"" are greatly complemented with those wonderful girls dancing all around the stage... That nice variant on starting of ""ROCK DJ"" really make people shout: ""LAST NIGHT A DJ SAVED MY LIFE"" then Robbie coming up from below the stage and those pretty girls doing their dance around him... The concert finish with a emotive ""ANGELS"". So, my qualification is 5/5Robbie as a showman: Unique. He's always playing and talking to attendance. He's dancing and running, that's a prove of his energy and enthusiasm for giving people more than they espect from him. He's mad when he had, but he's also touched by his emotions as ""FEEL"" shows us. It's something difficult to explain but Robbie's behavior store many different ways of express his happiness and madness. He even call a girl to kiss her... many things we cannot see in ther concerts. 5/5In conclusion: If you're a Robbie fan, it's your duty buying this DVD. You'll never see him like this again... Thinking twice... You will. But this is a chance to have all those things we couldn't see live and direct. If you're not a Robbie fan or maybe you haven't heard about him, BUY this DVD, to see how a great singer should guide a live show.As Robbie said at Knetworth: THIS IS ROBIE WILLIAMS, THIS IS MY BAND... AND FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS, YOUR ASS IS MINE!",5,What a show!!!,1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,2529,"['kind', 'DVDs', 'envy', 'British', 'lucky', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'watch', 'live', 'direct', 'showman', ""'m"", 'sure', 'best', 'nowadays.In', 'only', 'one', 'word', 'INCREDIBLE', 'Robbie', 'really', 'concert', 'prove', 'artist', 'were', 'born', 'sing', 'nice', 'songs', 'other', 'ones', 'make', 'people', 'go', 'crazy', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'Robbie', 'performance', 'also', 'band', 'chorus', 'stage', 'beautiful', 'dancers', 'Kate', 'Nikky', 'What', 'HOT', 'HOT', 'Girls', '.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'months', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'songs', 'were', 'included', 'When', 'saw', 'first', 'thing', 'liked', 'was', 'great', 'interactive', 'menu', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'Not', 'only', 'animations', 'images', 'sound', 'background', 'songs', 'So', 'first', 'sight', '5/5Then', 'track', 'list', 'are', 'almost', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'greatest', 'songs', 'regreted', 'two', 'missing', 'MILLENNIUM', 'SOMETHING', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'not', 'played', 'concert', 'watching', 'concert', 'got', 'satisfied', 'order', 'songs', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'starting', 'LET', 'ME', 'ENTERTAIN', 'YOU', 'WE', 'WILL', 'ROCK', 'YOU', 'going', 'wondeful', 'MONSOON', 'quieter', 'part', 'show', 'SHE', 'ONE', 'inmediately', 'played', 'SUPREME', 'KIDS', 'HOT', 'FUSGE', 'are', 'greatly', 'complemented', 'wonderful', 'girls', 'dancing', 'stage', 'nice', 'variant', 'starting', 'ROCK', 'DJ', 'really', 'make', 'people', 'LAST', 'NIGHT', 'A', 'DJ', 'SAVED', 'MY', 'LIFE', 'then', 'Robbie', 'coming', 'up', 'stage', 'pretty', 'girls', 'doing', 'dance', 'concert', 'finish', 'emotive', 'ANGELS', 'So', 'qualification', '5/5Robbie', 'showman', 'Unique', 'always', 'playing', 'talking', 'attendance', 'dancing', 'running', 'prove', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'giving', 'people', 'more', 'espect', 'mad', 'when', 'had', 'also', 'touched', 'emotions', 'FEEL', 'something', 'difficult', 'explain', 'Robbie', 'behavior', 'store', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'express', 'happiness', 'madness', 'even', 'call', 'girl', 'kiss', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'concerts', '5/5In', 'conclusion', ""'re"", 'Robbie', 'fan', 'duty', 'buying', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'again', 'Thinking', 'twice', 'will', 'chance', 'have', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'live', 'direct', ""'re"", 'not', 'Robbie', 'fan', 'maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'BUY', 'DVD', 'see', 'how', 'great', 'singer', 'should', 'guide', 'live', 'show.As', 'Robbie', 'said', 'Knetworth', 'THIS', 'ROBIE', 'WILLIAMS', 'THIS', 'IS', 'MY', 'BAND', 'THE', 'NEXT', 'TWO', 'HOURS', 'YOUR', 'ASS', 'IS', 'MINE']",N/A
793318,A1GZXVLCYY3LFI,B00015BE5E,"Kasper Michelsen ""Alcibiades""","[39, 41]","I have quite a collection of excellent concert DVDs by now, featuring artists like Phil Collins, Genesis, Tina Turner, Cher, Sheryl Crow and Kylie Minogue to mention some. I recently bought this DVD with Robbie Williams, and it's not the best concert I have seen - even though it is an excellent concert, mind you. This is, however, by far the most touching concert I've ever seen, I find myself moved close to tears several times, I freely admit.To understand this, a bit of background information is necesarry. Robbie played 3 gigs in front of 375.000 people at Knebworth , each night in front of a terrifying 125.000 audience! Robbie is visibly aware of this, shifting between being amazed, being shy and being terrified - as he sais, in one of his several monologues - ""Knebworth, for the first time in my life, I'm speechless, I truly am! I really hope that I can do a show tonight that will make you proud!""And this sums up exactly what's so special about this concert. Watch that adorably cute boyish face once, and you know that he's speaking the truth each and every moment. The crowd gives themself to him 100%, as he gives himself to them 100%, and he's on several occasions moved to tears - and there is no playing for the camera here. And no wonder, take the odds of the boy kicked from the polished boy-band Take That - the most succesfull boy-band of the 90'es - kicked out for taking drucks and having problems controlling his alcohol intake - and now, standing in front of a monster 125.000 crowd, who all love him. You might not realize just how large a crowd of 125.000 jammed onto a field is before you see this, but it's HUGE! And they're all - ALL - extatic. No wonder he's moved beyond words, and watching the emotions play on his face, I couln't help being moved with him. As he says in his final monologue, as he re-enters the stage after the show is finished: ""Knebworth, this has been the high of my career - I don't know, perhaps it'll drop from here - and don't contradict me here, I'm not fishing for compliments, it might do - but I don't care, cause this has made my life complete."" And this is clearly not a pre-written speech, it's his emotion then and there, and I don't wonder why he feels that way, what more could he really accomplish.Anyway, about the show. It seems they've tried to hide the tracklist, but here it is:- Let Me Entertain You - Let Love Be Your Energy - We Will Rock You (section) - Monsoon - Come Undone - Strong - Me And My Monkey - Hot Fudge - Mr. Bojangles - She's The One - Love Supreme - No Regrets - Kids - Better Man - Nan's Song - Feel - (encores:) Rock DJ - AngelsAlso, in the extra materials on DVD 2 (play the game for the hidden extras) you'll find a quite special version of the old Take That hit Back For Good - and this with an unique guest-performance of Marc Owen from the old band.The music is great throughout the show, including the occasional slip - take Robbie laughing when he play's wrong on the guitar during Nan's Song, or see him stop singing to call for the camer to show 3 girls pulling up their shirts showing their brests to him. In fact, this spontanity adds a certain charm to the show, and makes the fact that Robbie isn't the greatest singer in the world less important (even if he in fact does a very good job here, which he does). Besides from this, the interaction with the audience is great - audience sing-a-long-participation is done with karaokee-like lyrics on the huge screen on the stage; a girl is taken on stage during Come Undone, to her great pleassure (Robbie certainly doesn't hold himself back, not that she minds); and the introduction for She's The One, where he talks to a married couple in the audience, is just amazing. THEY probably had a moment of their life as well.The show is impressive, watch Robbie enter the scene head-down Houdini-like with a rope around the feet, lowered from the top of the scene. There is a huge screen on stage, that can seperate into 5 or 6 independant segments, giving lots of variability. The lightning is very impressing and gives plenty of light on the enourmous stage - which is sometimes a problem for some bands (take the Genesis 1992 tour for instance). There is fireworks and confetti at the end of the show. I think the porn-theme of the dancers in Hot Fudge is overdone and unnescesary, but ok ... that's a minor point.All in all, this is a disc that you shouldn't miss at if you are the tiniest bit interested in what's going on at the musical scene at the moment, or if your into Robbie's music. This is HUGE.Rating: 10/10",5,A deeply emotional and touching concert - and great show!,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,4579,"['have', 'quite', 'collection', 'excellent', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'now', 'featuring', 'artists', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'Genesis', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Cher', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Kylie', 'Minogue', 'mention', 'recently', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'not', 'best', 'concert', 'have', 'seen', 'even', 'excellent', 'concert', 'mind', 'however', 'far', 'most', 'touching', 'concert', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'find', 'moved', 'close', 'tears', 'several', 'times', 'freely', 'admit.To', 'understand', 'bit', 'background', 'information', 'necesarry', 'Robbie', 'played', '3', 'gigs', 'front', '375.000', 'people', 'Knebworth', 'night', 'front', 'terrifying', '125.000', 'audience', 'Robbie', 'visibly', 'aware', 'shifting', 'being', 'amazed', 'being', 'shy', 'being', 'terrified', 'one', 'several', 'monologues', 'Knebworth', 'first', 'time', 'life', ""'m"", 'speechless', 'truly', 'am', 'really', 'hope', 'can', 'do', 'show', 'tonight', 'will', 'make', 'proud', 'up', 'exactly', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'concert', 'Watch', 'adorably', 'cute', 'boyish', 'face', 'once', 'know', 'speaking', 'truth', 'moment', 'crowd', '100', '%', '100', '%', 'several', 'occasions', 'moved', 'tears', 'playing', 'camera', 'here', 'wonder', 'take', 'odds', 'boy', 'kicked', 'polished', 'boy-band', 'Take', 'most', 'succesfull', 'boy-band', ""90'es"", 'kicked', 'out', 'taking', 'drucks', 'having', 'problems', 'controlling', 'alcohol', 'intake', 'now', 'standing', 'front', 'monster', '125.000', 'crowd', 'who', 'love', 'might', 'not', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'large', 'crowd', '125.000', 'jammed', 'field', 'see', 'HUGE', ""'re"", 'extatic', 'wonder', 'moved', 'words', 'watching', 'emotions', 'play', 'face', 'coul', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'moved', 'final', 'monologue', 'stage', 'show', 'finished', 'Knebworth', 'been', 'high', 'career', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'drop', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'contradict', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'fishing', 'compliments', 'might', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'cause', 'made', 'life', 'complete', 'clearly', 'not', 'pre-written', 'speech', 'emotion', 'then', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'wonder', 'why', 'way', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'really', 'accomplish.Anyway', 'show', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'hide', 'tracklist', 'here', 'Let', 'Me', 'Entertain', 'Let', 'Love', 'Be', 'Your', 'Energy', 'Will', 'Rock', 'section', 'Monsoon', 'Come', 'Undone', 'Strong', 'Me', 'My', 'Monkey', 'Hot', 'Fudge', 'Mr.', 'Bojangles', 'One', 'Love', 'Supreme', 'Regrets', 'Kids', 'Better', 'Man', 'Nan', 'Song', 'Feel', 'encores', 'Rock', 'DJ', 'AngelsAlso', 'extra', 'materials', 'DVD', '2', 'play', 'game', 'hidden', 'extras', ""'ll"", 'find', 'quite', 'special', 'version', 'old', 'Take', 'hit', 'Back', 'Good', 'unique', 'guest-performance', 'Marc', 'Owen', 'old', 'band.The', 'music', 'great', 'show', 'including', 'occasional', 'slip', 'take', 'Robbie', 'laughing', 'when', 'play', 'wrong', 'guitar', 'Nan', 'Song', 'see', 'stop', 'singing', 'call', 'camer', 'show', '3', 'girls', 'pulling', 'up', 'shirts', 'showing', 'brests', 'fact', 'spontanity', 'certain', 'charm', 'show', 'fact', 'Robbie', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'singer', 'world', 'less', 'important', 'even', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'interaction', 'audience', 'great', 'audience', 'sing-a-long-participation', 'done', 'karaokee-like', 'lyrics', 'huge', 'screen', 'stage', 'girl', 'taken', 'stage', 'Come', 'Undone', 'great', 'pleassure', 'Robbie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'not', 'introduction', 'One', 'where', 'married', 'couple', 'audience', 'just', 'amazing', 'THEY', 'probably', 'had', 'moment', 'life', 'well.The', 'show', 'impressive', 'watch', 'Robbie', 'enter', 'scene', 'head-down', 'Houdini-like', 'rope', 'feet', 'lowered', 'top', 'scene', 'huge', 'screen', 'stage', 'can', 'seperate', '5', '6', 'independant', 'segments', 'giving', 'lots', 'variability', 'lightning', 'very', 'impressing', 'plenty', 'light', 'enourmous', 'stage', 'sometimes', 'problem', 'bands', 'take', 'Genesis', '1992', 'tour', 'instance', 'fireworks', 'confetti', 'end', 'show', 'think', 'porn-theme', 'dancers', 'Hot', 'Fudge', 'overdone', 'unnescesary', 'ok', 'minor', 'point.All', 'disc', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss', 'are', 'tiniest', 'bit', 'interested', 'what', 'going', 'musical', 'scene', 'moment', 'Robbie', 'music', 'HUGE.Rating', '10/10']",N/A

It is beyond me why he is not as popular in the States as he is in Europe.  Robbie Williams manages to combine his natural presence on stage and rapport with his fans with absolute professionalism.  Hence ""so rock n roll, so corporate suit"", as he sings in Come Undone.  You can feel the atmosphere of this temperate summer evening seep into your living room as you watch, and don't be surprised if you find yourself jumping along in time with the songs and clapping when they're finished.  I do it even when I'm watching it alone!So: five stars for quality and length of performance, both in terms of Robbie's own talent and the setup of the DVD.  Five stars also for addressing a huge audience, because this show will appeal to established fans and convert all those who haven't succumbed to Robbie's energy and charms.",5,"So rock n roll, so corporate suit....",1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,914,"['agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'one', 'one', 'live', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'why', 'not', 'popular', 'States', 'Europe', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'combine', 'natural', 'presence', 'stage', 'rapport', 'fans', 'absolute', 'professionalism', 'Hence', 'so', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'so', 'corporate', 'suit', 'Come', 'Undone', 'can', 'feel', 'atmosphere', 'temperate', 'summer', 'evening', 'seep', 'living', 'room', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'jumping', 'along', 'time', 'songs', 'clapping', 'when', ""'re"", 'finished', 'do', 'even', 'when', ""'m"", 'watching', 'alone', 'five', 'stars', 'quality', 'length', 'performance', 'terms', 'Robbie', 'own', 'talent', 'setup', 'DVD', 'Five', 'stars', 'also', 'addressing', 'huge', 'audience', 'show', 'will', 'appeal', 'established', 'fans', 'convert', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'succumbed', 'Robbie', 'energy', 'charms']",N/A
