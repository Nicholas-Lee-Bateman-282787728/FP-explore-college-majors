Julienne Moore plays Dr. Cara Harding, a psychiatrist who does not believe in multiple personalities disorder. Her father, played by Jeffrey DeMunn, introduces her to a patient who he believes is an interesting case since he is a young man who appears to have split personalities (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Rhys Meyers is incredible as he flawlessly and believably acts out various personalities with different accents and mannerisms. DeMunn was excellent too but I did not really care for Julienne Moore in this as I found her somewhat boring and not credible.The movie is great for the first half or so but then it gets boring and stupid as it morphs from a fast-paced psychological thriller into a confusing far-fetched supernatural horror movie.

1644004,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00C7T0EPS,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","{3.5 stars}6 SOULS has a compelling and unique storyline that nicely intermixes spiritual and psychological elements: There are some very original ideas here. It's well-produced and cinematized with realistic acting by all. It has the necessary focus but still leaves room for individual interpretation, the sort of film that you can watch multiple times, picking up new details and subtleties with each view. At times it seems pro-Christian, at times anti-Christian, or at least critical of the superstitious-fundamentalist brand of Christianity. Again, the religious elements are clear enough yet also vague enough.The plot does drag and meander a good bit. There are also some of the usual tired old demon-tropes (people throwing up black goop, etc). Still, this film has a fairly solid mythos behind it and relies more on surprise and suspense than it does raw schlock. While nothing really truly special, 6 SOULS is probably worth seeing if you like psychological/supernatural horror and have been disappointed by a lot of the other recent efforts in this genre.The ending leaves room for an interesting sequel.  .  .7 SOULS?",4,"It Looks Like Just Another Fright-Goof, but",1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,1130,"['3.5', 'stars', '6', 'SOULS', 'compelling', 'unique', 'storyline', 'nicely', 'intermixes', 'spiritual', 'psychological', 'elements', 'are', 'very', 'original', 'ideas', 'here', 'well-produced', 'cinematized', 'realistic', 'acting', 'necessary', 'focus', 'still', 'room', 'individual', 'interpretation', 'sort', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'picking', 'up', 'new', 'details', 'subtleties', 'view', 'times', 'pro-Christian', 'times', 'anti-Christian', 'least', 'critical', 'superstitious-fundamentalist', 'brand', 'Christianity', 'Again', 'religious', 'elements', 'are', 'clear', 'enough', 'yet', 'also', 'vague', 'enough.The', 'plot', 'drag', 'meander', 'good', 'bit', 'are', 'also', 'usual', 'tired', 'old', 'demon-tropes', 'people', 'throwing', 'up', 'black', 'goop', 'etc', 'Still', 'film', 'fairly', 'solid', 'mythos', 'more', 'surprise', 'suspense', 'raw', 'schlock', 'nothing', 'really', 'truly', 'special', '6', 'SOULS', 'probably', 'worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'psychological/supernatural', 'horror', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'lot', 'other', 'recent', 'efforts', 'genre.The', 'ending', 'leaves', 'room', 'interesting', 'sequel', '.7', 'SOULS']",6 Souls

That's exactly how I felt when I pressed ""Stop"" after watching ""6 Souls."" All the warning signs for a movie that doesn't deliver were there. For instance, it was originally released in 2010 with a different title (""Shelter"") and just now is seeing the light of day.Dr. Cara Harding (Julianne Moore) is introduced to a patient named Adam (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who has multiple personalities. After researching some of them, she realizes they are all actual murder victims. Cara starts digging into the man's past to discover how or if his personalities all tie together somehow. Her investigations lead to encounters with the victim's relatives and mysterious religious fanatics.Talk about a movie showing promise and then just falling off the deep end halfway through. ""6 Souls"" carries itself quite well with good pacing, creepy sequences, and a mystery that keeps you wondering what is really going on throughout. Suddenly, the whole thing derails and becomes a confusing mess which pits the followers of a weird mix of voodoo and Christianity against a crazy faith healer in a fatal spiritual battle.One really positive aspect of the movie is we get to see Jonathan Rhys Meyers really flex his acting muscles. He plays several distinct characters that each carry themselves uniquely and are from different parts of the country and use different accents. We get to see firsthand how talented Rhys Meyers really is.""6 Souls"" gets points taken off with me because it exhibits mixing voodoo and Christianity together. As a Christian, the film loses any credibility with me when the crazy old Granny Holler Witch (Joyce Feuller) is shown chanting over a body, sucking a man's soul out, and putting it in a jar before she begins curing him. People aren't supposed to combine pagan practices with Christian ones. The very idea is completely un-Biblical.""6 Souls"" looks and sounds wonderful. The 5.1 surround sound enhances the viewing experience by sonically submerging the audience directly into the center of the action. The picture is clear and the melancholy colors used for the movie fit its bleak tone.There's no bonus material featured on the Blu-ray version of ""6 Souls."" I can't believe there isn't audio commentary or a trailer for the movie included just to give the release some type of supplements. It would've been nice to hear what writer Michael Cooney or directors Mns Mrlind and Bj&ouml;rn Stein were thinking when the movie comes unhinged and veers off-track in the end.I wanted to like ""6 Souls"" as I popped it into my Blu-ray player. I was engaged and caught up in its initial narrative for about 70 of its 112 minutes. Unfortunately, the tale comes unraveled and spins out of control leaving an incoherent mess in its wake. Not even great acting from Julianne Moore and an even more impressive performance by Jonathan Rhys Meyers could save this from coming across as an inept attempt at making a supernatural thriller or psychological horror film.",3,"Blu-ray Review: ""6 Souls""",1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,3108,"['nothing', 'worse', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'mesmerized', 'first', 'two', 'only', 'lose', 'respect', 'last', 'two', 'exactly', 'how', 'felt', 'when', 'pressed', 'Stop', 'watching', '6', 'Souls', 'warning', 'signs', 'movie', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'were', 'there', 'instance', 'was', 'originally', 'released', '2010', 'different', 'title', 'Shelter', 'just', 'now', 'seeing', 'light', 'day.Dr', 'Cara', 'Harding', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'introduced', 'patient', 'named', 'Adam', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'who', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'researching', 'are', 'actual', 'murder', 'victims', 'Cara', 'digging', 'man', 'past', 'discover', 'how', 'personalities', 'tie', 'together', 'somehow', 'investigations', 'lead', 'encounters', 'victim', 'relatives', 'mysterious', 'religious', 'fanatics.Talk', 'movie', 'showing', 'promise', 'then', 'just', 'falling', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'halfway', '6', 'Souls', 'quite', 'well', 'good', 'pacing', 'creepy', 'sequences', 'mystery', 'wondering', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Suddenly', 'whole', 'thing', 'derails', 'confusing', 'mess', 'followers', 'weird', 'mix', 'voodoo', 'Christianity', 'crazy', 'faith', 'healer', 'fatal', 'spiritual', 'battle.One', 'really', 'positive', 'aspect', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'really', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscles', 'several', 'distinct', 'characters', 'carry', 'uniquely', 'are', 'different', 'parts', 'country', 'use', 'different', 'accents', 'get', 'see', 'firsthand', 'how', 'talented', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'really', '6', 'Souls', 'points', 'taken', 'off', 'mixing', 'voodoo', 'Christianity', 'together', 'Christian', 'film', 'credibility', 'when', 'crazy', 'old', 'Granny', 'Holler', 'Witch', 'Joyce', 'Feuller', 'shown', 'chanting', 'body', 'sucking', 'man', 'soul', 'putting', 'jar', 'curing', 'People', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'combine', 'pagan', 'practices', 'Christian', 'ones', 'very', 'idea', 'completely', 'un-Biblical', '6', 'Souls', 'wonderful', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'viewing', 'experience', 'sonically', 'submerging', 'audience', 'directly', 'center', 'action', 'picture', 'clear', 'melancholy', 'colors', 'used', 'movie', 'fit', 'bleak', 'bonus', 'material', 'featured', 'Blu-ray', 'version', '6', 'Souls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""n't"", 'audio', 'commentary', 'trailer', 'movie', 'included', 'just', 'give', 'release', 'type', 'supplements', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'what', 'writer', 'Michael', 'Cooney', 'directors', 'Mns', 'Mrlind', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'Stein', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'movie', 'unhinged', 'veers', 'off-track', 'end.I', 'wanted', 'like', '6', 'Souls', 'popped', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'was', 'engaged', 'caught', 'up', 'initial', 'narrative', '70', '112', 'minutes', 'Unfortunately', 'tale', 'unraveled', 'control', 'leaving', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'wake', 'Not', 'even', 'great', 'acting', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'performance', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'could', 'save', 'coming', 'across', 'inept', 'attempt', 'making', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film']",6 Souls

I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked it because I just came out of a relationship with a man who acted exactly like the character of Johnathan Myers. Myers played the part of a man who was possessed however carried traits of a serious personality disorder. How the playright came up with this idea was wonderful in my opinion. The movie balanced itself off by adding a twist of religion thoroughout--withcraft, Christianity, and a strong faith lesson towards the ending of the movie. The message here is very very strong. Julianna Moore played the part of the pyschiatrist as well, the daughter of one who was persistent in helping this one particular client--Myers. Another twist in the movie is seeing the demonic forces take over not only her client, but her daughter as well. In conclusion, the movie is a winner and definitely tells a meesage about losing your faith in God. The journey in which this movie takes you is inspiring enough to make you actually sit back when it is over and address your own faith and beliefs.

1644010,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00C7T0EPS,Matthew Scott Baker,"[2, 3]","The concept of multiple personality disorders is an interesting but frightening one.  I'm not sure why, but the idea that someone might have multiple `people' living inside of them is terrifying to me.  I guess it freaks me out because you never know who you would really be speaking to if that was the case.  So, when 6 SOULS came around, I knew it was going to be a film I had to check out.  I'm glad I did, too...not only is this movie a heck of a thrill-ride, but it's also smartly written and very entertaining.The whole air of this movie just screams `creepy'.  Of course, mental health is almost a completely different world in itself, so the sense of foreboding is probably pretty justified.  That backdrop combined with the premise of the film set the stage for a staggering horror jaunt that will haunt you long after the credits roll.One major aspect of the terror contained within 6 SOULS is the acting.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the role of a lifetime.  Each time a new persona takes over his body, Rhys Meyers goes into a fit of sorts, contorting his body into impossible positions as the `person' struggles to the top of the body.  Then, once the persona is in place, Rhys Meyers does an impeccable job of portraying him or her.  From a crippled, back-woods mountain boy to an elderly doctor and more, this role offers the actor the chance to shine and show his immense diversity of talent.  Julianne Moore is also noteworthy as the doctor; I've enjoyed seeing her on-screen for many years, and I hope she continues to make films for many more.The film is shot well and pacing is nice, but the story itself is where it shines.  The audience is given just enough information as the film progresses to stay in-touch with what is going on, and this helps to create an intense and thrilling atmosphere.  Then, as the puzzle comes together towards the end, the film grabs the audience in a choke-hold and doesn't let go.  The result is a fine horror flick that any genre fan should be happy to own.6 SOULS is a definite win for me and I recommend giving it a look.  There's not really any gore, but there's plenty of intensity; I might even say this is a perfect date movie if you are looking to scare your significant other without grossing them out.

So I judge them strictly upon their ability to hold my interest.  This one did a pretty good job.  Like a lot of them, this one starts out with a logical scientific explanation of the character's strange behavior along psychological pathologies, but becomes ""spooky"" when it's found that something other worldly is at the root of the problem.  The ability of the writers and producers to come up with something unique, that hasn't been done before is a challenge which, to me, often determines the success of the story line.This one uses what world religions have used for centuries to control the masses . . . ""Believe without question, or you'll wish you had.""  By the time the protagonist realizes the error of her ways, it's either too late, or at least almost too late to avert disaster.  The only diversion from that old formula is the connection to old mountain ways and an old crone rather than a well recognized and accepted religion.  The very ending has been done and over done too many times, but all in all a pretty entertaining movie.  I enjoyed it and my popcorn.",4,"Believe it or not . . .

1644017,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B00C7T0EPS,ribcage,"[1, 3]","6 Souls starts with an awesome, mysterious concept that even through it's full reveal I absolutely loved. It was great trying to unravel what exactly was going on with Jonathan Rhys Meyer's schizophrenic character -- especially with how fantastic of a job Meyers did with it. He was incredible. The idea was great.Sadly, it got plugged into a ho-hum storyline. Moore acts well enough as the outsider trying to dig out the truth, but it plays out like many, many movies just like it. My wife was able to call out almost the entire rest of the movie from the midway mark. It was cruelly predictable.Another down point for me is that there was not much of a fear factor to it. I know that this is more of a thriller than an all out horror movie, but it did have its moments going down the all out horror vein where it could have been creepy, nerve-tingling, and even frightening but that punch never hit.It is at least not BROKEN as a movie, and I enjoyed watching it despite the predictability. I'll definitely chalk that up to the cast who all did an excellent job. Fans of Meyers or Moore will absolutely want to check this one out, for the rest of us it's a solid lazy Sunday afternoon kind of movie.",3,"Great idea, bland story",1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,1201,"['6', 'Souls', 'starts', 'awesome', 'mysterious', 'concept', 'even', 'full', 'reveal', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'was', 'great', 'trying', 'unravel', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'going', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyer', 'schizophrenic', 'character', 'especially', 'how', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Meyers', 'did', 'was', 'incredible', 'idea', 'was', 'great.Sadly', 'got', 'plugged', 'ho-hum', 'storyline', 'Moore', 'well', 'enough', 'outsider', 'trying', 'dig', 'out', 'truth', 'out', 'many', 'many', 'movies', 'just', 'My', 'wife', 'was', 'able', 'call', 'out', 'almost', 'entire', 'rest', 'movie', 'midway', 'mark', 'was', 'cruelly', 'predictable.Another', 'down', 'point', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'fear', 'factor', 'know', 'more', 'thriller', 'out', 'horror', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'moments', 'going', 'out', 'horror', 'vein', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'creepy', 'nerve-tingling', 'even', 'frightening', 'punch', 'never', 'hit.It', 'least', 'not', 'BROKEN', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'predictability', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'chalk', 'up', 'cast', 'who', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Fans', 'Meyers', 'Moore', 'will', 'absolutely', 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'rest', 'solid', 'lazy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'kind', 'movie']",6 Souls
1644018,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00C7T0EPS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 8]","6 Souls (Mns Mrlind and Bj&ouml;rn Stein, 2010)For about half its length, with one glaring exception noted below, 6 Souls (originally released under the title Shelter) is a very interesting supernatural thriller. Then screenwriter Michael Cooney (Identity) starts pulling in some weird theological arguments, and the movie gets kicked off-kilter, but it was probably still salvageable at that point. Then comes the climax, and it's terrible, but not so terrible that it made me want to gouge my eyes out.Then comes the denouement.So really, the best thing I can say about 6 Souls is that if you turn it off ten minutes before the end, you're actually going to get a pretty good movie. It focuses on Cara Harding (Far from Heaven's Julianne Moore), a psychologist who subscribes to the belief that Dissociative Identity Disorder, under whatever name you'd like to shelve it, does not exist. Her father (The Green Mile's Jeffrey DeMunn), a psychologist himself, calls her in for a consult on a patient named David (b.Monkey's Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). While she's talking to him, dad flips David's switch, and David becomes Adam. The challenge: Cara has to prove that one of the two personalities is the real guy, and that he somehow found out enough about the other one--also a real guy--to have completely assimilated the other personality. But of course, things are not nearly so simple as that...One of the biggest problems with this movie is one of the biggest problems with Julianne Moore's career--her inconsistency as an actress. When she brings her A game, she is capable of taking a three-minute cameo and turning a good film into a great one (Chicago Cab). When she doesn't, well, we get the unwatchable crap that is Safe. I'm not sure I've ever seen her flip it on and off in the blink of an eye before this movie, but Julianne Moore in the opening sequence, when she's giving testimony, and Julianne Moore in the second sequence, when she's in a bar afterwards, might as well be two different actresses. The testimony scene is as wooden as the fake coughing fit she goes into about a quarter of the way through Safe. It's just plain terrible. But then she seems to find her stride, and for most of the movie, we get the good Julianne Moore capping off a high-powered cast (aside from those mentioned above, Brooklynn Proulx, Frances Conroy, and Brian Anthony Wilson all have major parts, and you'll recognize a lot of the folks in minor roles here) who, once the movie starts digging its own grave, do the best they can with the script they'd been given. And like I said above, up until the big climax, the movie is still relatively salvageable; just turn it off right around the time Sammy and Stephen get to the holler and you're good to go. You'll miss the climax, but trust me, it's as predictable as anything on the Hallmark Movie Channel; you can fill in the blanks yourself, and you'll probably do a better job. But if you must watch the climax, for the love of Lazarus, turn the movie off before that godawful final scene you just know is coming. It is a soul-crusher. It has the potential to make you hate actors you otherwise revere. You have been warned. * ",2,When Rabbit Snickers.,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,3176,"['6', 'Souls', 'Mns', 'Mrlind', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'Stein', '2010', 'about', 'length', 'one', 'glaring', 'exception', 'noted', '6', 'Souls', 'originally', 'released', 'title', 'Shelter', 'very', 'interesting', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'Then', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'Cooney', 'Identity', 'pulling', 'weird', 'theological', 'arguments', 'movie', 'kicked', 'off-kilter', 'was', 'probably', 'still', 'salvageable', 'point', 'Then', 'climax', 'terrible', 'not', 'so', 'terrible', 'made', 'want', 'gouge', 'eyes', 'out.Then', 'denouement.So', 'really', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', '6', 'Souls', 'turn', 'off', 'ten', 'minutes', 'end', ""'re"", 'actually', 'going', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Cara', 'Harding', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'psychologist', 'who', 'belief', 'Dissociative', 'Identity', 'Disorder', 'name', ""'d"", 'like', 'shelve', 'not', 'exist', 'father', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Jeffrey', 'DeMunn', 'psychologist', 'consult', 'patient', 'named', 'David', 'b.Monkey', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'talking', 'David', 'switch', 'David', 'Adam', 'challenge', 'Cara', 'prove', 'one', 'two', 'personalities', 'real', 'guy', 'somehow', 'found', 'out', 'enough', 'other', 'one', 'also', 'real', 'guy', 'have', 'completely', 'assimilated', 'other', 'personality', 'course', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'simple', 'One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'movie', 'one', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'career', 'inconsistency', 'actress', 'When', 'A', 'game', 'capable', 'taking', 'three-minute', 'cameo', 'turning', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'one', 'Chicago', 'Cab', 'When', ""n't"", 'well', 'get', 'unwatchable', 'crap', 'Safe', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'flip', 'blink', 'eye', 'movie', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'opening', 'sequence', 'when', 'giving', 'testimony', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'second', 'sequence', 'when', 'bar', 'afterwards', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'two', 'different', 'actresses', 'testimony', 'scene', 'as', 'wooden', 'fake', 'coughing', 'fit', 'quarter', 'way', 'Safe', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'then', 'find', 'stride', 'most', 'movie', 'get', 'good', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'capping', 'off', 'high-powered', 'cast', 'aside', 'mentioned', 'Brooklynn', 'Proulx', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'Brian', 'Anthony', 'Wilson', 'have', 'major', 'parts', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'lot', 'folks', 'minor', 'roles', 'here', 'who', 'once', 'movie', 'digging', 'own', 'grave', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'script', ""'d"", 'been', 'given', 'said', 'above', 'up', 'big', 'climax', 'movie', 'still', 'relatively', 'salvageable', 'just', 'turn', 'off', 'right', 'time', 'Sammy', 'Stephen', 'get', 'holler', ""'re"", 'good', 'go', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'climax', 'as', 'predictable', 'anything', 'Hallmark', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'can', 'fill', 'blanks', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'must', 'watch', 'climax', 'love', 'Lazarus', 'turn', 'movie', 'off', 'godawful', 'final', 'scene', 'just', 'know', 'coming', 'soul-crusher', 'potential', 'make', 'hate', 'actors', 'otherwise', 'revere', 'have', 'been', 'warned', '*']",6 Souls
