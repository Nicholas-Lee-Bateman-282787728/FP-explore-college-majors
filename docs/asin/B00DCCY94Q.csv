Its not over the top, though. A couple of kills are pretty brutal but its not one of 'those' movies. The movie was reminiscent of another film  (Creep- an excellent movie) but its not another Creep. There are more differences than similarities. Its just a feeling I had while watching it. You know how I feel about those reductive comparisons by now... The premise was creative: a nazi experiment created people highly resistant to pain and hard to kill that are rumored to live in the tunnels our 'urban explorers' are exploring. We do not see a community but 1 man and he is enough. The film was well done, though I was a little frustrated that there weren't any subtitles for the portions of dialogue in German. Still, it wasn't that much and it doesn't actually prevent you from knowing what you need to know, The rest is a struggle for survival.

Teslovich,"[0, 0]","A stereotypic, done many times before, plot of young adults continuously making dumb decisions in an underground environment while being chased by bad person (s). Cheap to make - just need abandoned or little used dark corridors/rooms with a few cheap to hire ($100/day) actors and a few prosthetics with the usual associated torture props. This one added a tiresome and almost pointless Nazi backstory. Slight variations between all these nearly identical films coupled with a not discerning audience results in enough profit to keep this sub genre in business.

Terrific setting, great atmosphere, good directing and cinematography, good acting...introduces really creepy sadistic killer...then becomes yet another mind-boggling presentation of abject stupidity. Would you sit outside a door for several excruciating minutes as your lover was being repeatedly suffocated and brutally tortured, while the whole time the killer is distracted and you have a deadly weapon? Would you then try to trap the sadist by making noise, luring and  locking him in a room, then leaving only a FORK in a lock to hold him at bay when you could have killed him a second time? Then fired warning shots instead of killing him? Then not bashed his head in despite the pleas of the girlfriend when he is helpless? Then repeatedly separated from her, then left her and tried out cell phones (with no idea where you are miles underground) oblivious to the killer hunting you...etc. etc. etc. She escapes, then stops running for no reason at a train station. Then unwashed, grimy, supposedly bullet-ridden and bloody killer is believed by rational locals to be a ticket collector despite her being obviously traumatized and terrified, and making repeated pleas that he will kill her...really? WTF? BTW-these are supposed to be &#34;urban explorers&#34; here; experienced, survival-focused, daring adventurers. The script writer created characters who are so stupid you wonder how they can eat breakfast cereal without killing themselves.You have the budget, the setting, the actors...why not a good movie? So easy to make minor changes to make believable. This movie is a travesty. If you like movies which have initial potential but which become mind-explodingly stupid (I'm looking at you, ATM and Crowsnest), or like to watch mentally challenged people get tortured, then have at it.

1654885,A31BDEUO4D8X6W,B00DCCY94Q,wade,"[3, 5]","Watched this great film several days ago, and i have to say that i really liked it. It takes place deep down below the streets i believe it is somewhere in germany or berlin. There are several really cute girls and guys who hire a tour guide to show them the deep dark tunnels deep below a dance club. The storyline was alright, and the filming was okay... but i found the lighting to be so dark that you couldn't see much of anything. most of the film shows these unlucky adults getting picked off one by one, by a really warped, insane, disturbed man who lives in what looks like to be a abandoned bomb shelter. As the girls and guys are picked off they are drug to a freezer department where they are prepared for the madman;s next meal. when the tour guide falls and breaks his leg two of the girls go to seek help. (it is never fully explained... but i think that there is a sexual relation between the two girls). What is a little confusing... the girls just disappear and it is never explained as to what happens to them. Later in the film there is a unclothed body and head that may have been the remains of the two... (i wonder if maybe 10 minutes of their demise that hit the cutting room floor). Was hoping that the ending would have been a little better... with some of the girls escaping... but it didnt end that way. I get the impression that the killer will come back to life for another later film. Overall this film may be liked by more guys than gals... there was alot of blood and gore in it that was very creepy.",5,"A really cold, creepy, dark film",1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,1532,"['Watched', 'great', 'film', 'several', 'days', 'ago', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'i', 'really', 'liked', 'place', 'deep', 'down', 'streets', 'i', 'believe', 'somewhere', 'germany', 'berlin', 'are', 'several', 'really', 'cute', 'girls', 'guys', 'who', 'hire', 'tour', 'guide', 'show', 'deep', 'dark', 'tunnels', 'deep', 'dance', 'club', 'storyline', 'was', 'alright', 'filming', 'was', 'okay', 'i', 'found', 'lighting', 'be', 'so', 'dark', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'anything', 'most', 'film', 'unlucky', 'adults', 'getting', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'really', 'warped', 'insane', 'disturbed', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'abandoned', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'girls', 'guys', 'are', 'picked', 'are', 'drug', 'freezer', 'department', 'where', 'are', 'prepared', 'madman', 'next', 'meal', 'when', 'tour', 'guide', 'breaks', 'leg', 'two', 'girls', 'go', 'seek', 'help', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'i', 'think', 'sexual', 'relation', 'two', 'girls', 'What', 'little', 'confusing', 'girls', 'just', 'disappear', 'never', 'explained', 'what', 'Later', 'film', 'unclothed', 'body', 'head', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'remains', 'two', 'i', 'wonder', 'maybe', '10', 'minutes', 'demise', 'hit', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Was', 'hoping', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'girls', 'escaping', 'end', 'way', 'get', 'impression', 'killer', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'later', 'film', 'Overall', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'liked', 'more', 'guys', 'gals', 'was', 'alot', 'blood', 'gore', 'was', 'very', 'creepy']",The Depraved
