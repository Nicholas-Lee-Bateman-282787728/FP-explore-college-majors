1130793,A13FGQDHTDRV14,B00118VEEQ,"John Wheeler ""Johanan Rakkav""","[1, 1]","I will never quite understand why Walt Disney Productions decided to ""breathe some fresh air"" into the Pooh Franchise by replacing Christopher Robin with Darby, as they did in MY FRIENDS TIGGER AND POOH. I understand it even less now having seen the upcoming trailer for the new theatrical movie, in which Christopher Robin seems finally to be given his due. If you already hate Disney Pooh, then shy away from this DVD, as you probably have already from the TV show it's based on.But... if you're willing to take the TV show on its own dramatic merits, as I found myself doing despite myself when I reviewed this DVD, then you should really like this DVD. Darby and Christopher Robin would be ""best buds"" if only they were allowed to be together. Darby is a sweet, curious, thoughtful girl with a lot of ethics and an enviable ability to wear bright colors. She's also more physically active than Christopher Robin has usually been (this student of Jungian/Myers-Briggs personality types suspects she's an ENFP to Christopher Robin's INFP), and so can deal with Tigger's energy and exploit it in her ""detective work"" more readily. The animation is computer-generated, the action well-paced, and the stories less whimsical than the traditionally animated series starring Christopher Robin and Pooh which came out some years prior to this.The one real drawback to this collection? In the UK there were two episodes in the series where Christopher Robin was featured, but they have never been shown in the US to my knowledge and you won't find them on this DVD. Too. Bad.
