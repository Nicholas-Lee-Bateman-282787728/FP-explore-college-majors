But this version of CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT was a major disappointment.  It's true I'm a huge fan of the original.  But I was still prepared to enjoy this one and judge it on its own merits.  I knew it was directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and thought perhaps - being the multi-talented man that he is - he might have done a good directing job.  But...I won't address that now.  This movie has far more important things to gripe about.The acting in this movie is sub-par at best but mostly way over the top.  Failed attempts at comedy breaks revolve mostly around the son-in-law-to-be sporting a spiked mullet, leather jacket, and acting ambitions.  So he is always in character practicing for his next big gig (preparing to play a serial killer).  At one point he even grabs someone's shades and says (imitating the director's famous role), ""I'll be back.""  This guy soon becomes the Jar Jar Binks of this movie, and it's likely you'll cringe every time one of his scenes appears and sigh with relief when its over.Tony Curtis's performance is very overacted as well.  And most of the film consists of bland and unauthentic ""family"" moments along with the awkward, forced romance which blossoms between Dyan Cannon and Kris Kristofferson.This film has absolutely none of the delightful charm of the original.  There are many great Christmas movies out there.  Fortunately, there aren't that many duds.

318737,AHVG37KI3IM38,6302526795,G-Fan,"[0, 0]","I had been wanting to see this movie for years, but somehow had never gotten around to it.  I love the original from 1945 with Barbara Stanwyck, and since I'd always found Dyan Cannon hugely appealing (I loved her in DeathTrap), I decided to order this from Amazon based solely on my desire to watch it.It has a great comedic premise, somewhat updating the plot of the original. Cannon is the host of her own television cooking show, and of course - she can't cook.  Therein lies pretty much the entire source of humor for this 1992 TV movie.  Since she, or her show's producer (Tony Curtis) will do pretty much anything to improve her ratings, they latch upon a plan to use a media hero (Kris Kristofferson, whose character lost his home in a fire) to boost viewership.  Their plan is to invite him to Cannon's perfect home in Connecticut (which doesn't exist - she lives in a NYC apartment), meet her perfect family (which also doesn't exist - she's single), and enjoy a perfect Christmas dinner to be cooked by Cannon (good luck with that!), all on live TV.  Sounds pretty funny, right?Of course, everything in this particular universe of television entertainment is a masquerade and a lie.  With a better script, and in the hands of a more competent director (which in this case was Arnold Schwarzenegger), this could have been a lighthearted and sophisticated romantic romp, with Cannon and Kristofferson unexpectedly falling in love.  Unfortunately, this train wreck of a movie turns out to be a largely boring and disappointing exercise in slapstick.  Sure, the 1945 original had its share of slapstick situations and misunderstandings, but it still pulled things off nicely without anyone embarrassing themselves.  Poor Tony Curtis, whom I've always enjoyed, was asked to mug his way through this entire remake, turning in probably the most embarrassing performance of his career.  I couldn't help but feel sorry for him.  The rest of the cast didn't fare much better, with Kristofferson typically wooden, though I still somehow came away enjoying Dyan Cannon's performance.I really wanted to like this movie a whole lot more than I did. Honestly, the whole thing just seems tired and predictable.  And yes, I realize I'm quite familiar with the basic plot, being a fan of the original.  But this 1992 version of Christmas in Connecticut simply did not bring anything new to the table.  I guess I was expecting something fresh and funny, rather than worn out and basically tedious.  I'm not a big fan of remakes anyway, and if the truth be told, this is one that really has no good reason to exist.  Sorry, Arnold.  I've always been a big fan of your movies, but in a case such as this, you'd have been much better off leaving the directing to the pros.  Maybe if you'd had some gunfire and explosions, it would have been a bit more palatable.  Or it might have been pretty funny to have the Terminator show up at the house in Connecticut and noisily terminate all of these annoying people (except Dyan, of course) just in time for Christmas dinner! But as it is, I'm afraid this version Of CIC in my DVD collection will have to remain a one time only viewing experience.

Diane Cannon is always beautiful manages to touch your heart. The supporting cast help make this film funny and pleasant to watch. A good twist to the usual Christmas films. I love both the original movie with Barbara Stanwyck and this one.,4,Good Christmas,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,364,"['hope', 'Amazon', 'considers', 'adding', 'funny', 'movie', 'instant', 'videos', 'purchase', 'only', 'way', ""'m"", 'buying', 'movies', 'now', 'Diane', 'Cannon', 'always', 'beautiful', 'manages', 'touch', 'heart', 'supporting', 'cast', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'funny', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'good', 'twist', 'usual', 'Christmas', 'films', 'love', 'original', 'movie', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'one']",Christmas in Connecticut 1992  VHS
