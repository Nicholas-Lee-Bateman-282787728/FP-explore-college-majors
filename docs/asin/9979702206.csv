I'm amazed at his patience under the visible stress of an aching head and body after braving the Icelandic weather to shoot this revealing documentation.  How much more can he do to show his appreciation for the support of his fans worldwide?  His behavior speaks volumes about the depth of his character and his commitment to excellence and dedication as an actor.  His star is definitely rising and he is indeed 'paying his dues'...he is not afraid to shoulder the tough roles, transforming himself into a character in ways that startle directors and producers alike.  When he signs on to play a role they can be assured of this:  they will get much, much more than their money's worth from the likes of this humble, towering Scotsman who has his feet planted solidly on the ground and who has restored the grandeur of moviemaking.  Don't look for his handsome face in the gossip rags as he's rarely caught up in their sordid stories...he's too mature to get swept up in their tasteless diatribes...he's too busy concentrating on his career to cater to the crowded flashbulbs.  The law profession lost an excellent attorney when he set his sights on becoming an actor; can't you just see him in the courtroom making his case summarization!  He's stunning in a suit and tie but even better in his preferred 'dressed-down' look of an old tee shirt, old jeans and an old leather jacket - like in THE JURY film...go getum, Gerry.

A film that is plagued with natural and financial disasters.  A crew and cast hell-bent on making a story hit the big screen.  Without pay.  Without comfort.  Without food and gas at some points.  Without support from those promising financial backing overseas.  Under questionably safe conditions.

I think there is incredible value in the tale of this movie's production--more so than in the actual movie itself.  There is a lesson that perhaps Odin wanted communicated: suffer valiantly, strive with honor and heart, let the weak give up, let the fools scramble away, and produce your work at all costs with all the talent that you can, under all conditions--just to see it done.  And done well.These actors and crew members deserve our respect.  In an age where Hollywood film industry people are so full of themselves, so vapid, so weak-kneed and uncreative, we can compare them to Gustafsson and his miracle workers.
