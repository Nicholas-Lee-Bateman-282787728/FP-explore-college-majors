There is no way I am going to buy this movie because it offers absolutely nothing new to the Action/Adventure genre, which recieves much of this multitudinous waste. The plot, if it can be called that, has to do with the Chimera virus and its possible release into the human population, which would kill millions. The characters have about as much depth as a pancake, the action sequences use too much slow-motion, in an overt attempt to cash in on the success of the previous year's &quot;The Matrix.&quot; Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, in the last film he was into finesse, but now its guns and using the same ninja manuevers over and over again. The final battle also attempts to generate the electricity of &quot;Speed,&quot; whenever you think the villain is dead, he jumps back up to keep fighting. There is another scene with the lead actress just standing on a cliff, as if she will commit suicide. The camera goes to Cruise mindlessly killing Aussie security guards, but the camera comes back to her half a dozen times, for about 30 seconds each time, before the helicopter comes. It made me want to walk out. If you enjoy movies with a bare-bones plot, cardboard characters, and slow action sequences, this is one for you. But this overrated junk will be coming to a bargain bin near you soon, to be replaced on the shelves by others of its kind, movies to be forgotten in a year.

522206,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00003CXDF,Alex Udvary,"[3, 6]","About this movie! I remember seeing the ad's for this movie, thinking it really does look awful. They seemed to have abandon the old tv show's  formula, and replace it with this junk! When I went to the theater to see  this movie, I had no idea I was going to be watching the latest James Bond  film! It's hard to believe Robert Towne could have written such garbage.  I've heard people say the first one was confusing, which to be honest, I  can't understand why they say that, but if they thought that one was  confusing, wait till they see this one! There's such a lack of plot here,  that the same &quot;tricks&quot; or &quot;devices&quot; are played over and  over again, untill the point where I just couldn't take it anymore. Just  how many time did they want to work on the &quot;mask switching&quot;!  It  must of happened at the very least 6 or 7 times. I can't understand how an  actor( if you can really call him that) like Tom Cruise can go from making  a great movie like &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; to this. And as for Thandie  Newton, I have some advice for her, before you start ruining movies like  Bertolucci's &quot;Besiege&quot; and this one, why don't you consider  acting lesson. And I'm only saying this for her own good, if she plans on  continuing making movies. Now for the directing. I've heard many many  people speak very high of John Woo. I've even heard some say he's one of  the best directors around. How can someone say that! When I think of great  directors I think of Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa, Scorsese, Truffaut,  Coppola, and many many others, but John Woo?  When I think of Woo I think  of him as not really a director, but more so a choreographer who can  sometimes setup some nice action sequences. And to be perfectly honest,  yes, this movie does have it's share of good action scenes, but I can also  say, that not all of them work, but that's only expected. There's no way he  could have made every single scene work, lets be honest. Besides the action  scenes there's one more things that saves the movie.

522215,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXDF,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I know that Beany is going to hate me for this, since he holds DePalma's original in such high esteem he actually considers the sequels to be repulsive, but I actually really like all three films in the series and feel that they play off one another rather well.  There is no denying that original 96 film is, BY FAR, the best in the series, but Woo's follow up is very engaging in its stark differences.Instead of playing a head game on us this time, Woo takes Hunt and his escapades in a drastically different direction.  Woo, who is well known for his unique brand of action films, makes an impressionable mark on this film, layering scene after scene with his visionary stylings and delivering a stunning array of action sequences that ooze forth with eye-catching symmetry.  The plot becomes an afterthought (unlike the original, which was all about plot).  It has been commented that this film was basically built around the action scenes, and it shows, but that is the beauty of what Woo did here.The original film was engaging and spellbinding because it made you think (hard), but this film is equally as engaging and spellbinding for the opposite reason, it makes you stare (hard).The film revolves around Hunt and a thief Nyah who fall in love after getting steamy only to have their affections tested when they join forces to smoke out Sean, Nyah's ex-lover who happens to be selling off a deadly virus.  Things get sticky (as always) and Hunt has to fight his way out, and fight he does.With countless action scenes that involve a freelance climb up the side of a mountain that still gives me chills; one of the best car chase scenes in movie history; a brilliant ending battle between Cruise and Scott (complete with motorcycles) and a slew of other expertly crafted espionage stuff, `Mission Impossible: 2' is totally absorbing.Tom Cruise, as much as I dislike him, was a perfect fit for this film, and he carried that perfect fit through all three films.  His arrogance is balanced beautifully with his dedication, and the layers of humanity given him here (no matter how forced at times) play off him nicely.  Dougray Scott makes the perfect villain and I hate that he has pretty much disappeared.  After his stint in `Ever After' I saw `heartthrob' written all over him, and then he did this and I saw versatility and really thought he would be everywhere.  Sadly, he kind of just went away.  Thandie Newton hasn't gone anywhere, and I'm happy about that.  She is totally hit or miss for me, but when she hits (like she does here), she is unforgettable.So, is this as good as DePalma's near masterpiece?  No, but it's a totally different film and it compliments the original.  I own all three, and like them all to varying degrees (I feel like the third film tried hard to mix the plot depth of the original with the action style of Woo's to uneven effect, but Hoffman is seethingly brilliant and reason enough to see the film).",4,"A different route, but an effective one...",1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,2946,"['know', 'Beany', 'going', 'hate', 'DePalma', 'original', 'such', 'high', 'esteem', 'actually', 'sequels', 'be', 'repulsive', 'actually', 'really', 'three', 'films', 'series', 'feel', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'rather', 'well', 'denying', 'original', '96', 'film', 'BY', 'FAR', 'best', 'series', 'Woo', 'follow', 'up', 'very', 'engaging', 'stark', 'differences.Instead', 'playing', 'head', 'game', 'time', 'Woo', 'Hunt', 'escapades', 'drastically', 'different', 'direction', 'Woo', 'who', 'well', 'known', 'unique', 'brand', 'action', 'films', 'impressionable', 'mark', 'film', 'layering', 'scene', 'scene', 'visionary', 'stylings', 'delivering', 'stunning', 'array', 'action', 'sequences', 'ooze', 'forth', 'eye-catching', 'symmetry', 'plot', 'afterthought', 'original', 'was', 'plot', 'been', 'commented', 'film', 'was', 'basically', 'built', 'action', 'scenes', 'beauty', 'what', 'Woo', 'did', 'here.The', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'engaging', 'spellbinding', 'made', 'think', 'hard', 'film', 'equally', 'engaging', 'spellbinding', 'opposite', 'reason', 'stare', 'hard', '.The', 'film', 'Hunt', 'thief', 'Nyah', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'getting', 'steamy', 'only', 'have', 'affections', 'tested', 'when', 'join', 'forces', 'smoke', 'out', 'Sean', 'Nyah', 'ex-lover', 'who', 'be', 'selling', 'off', 'deadly', 'virus', 'Things', 'get', 'sticky', 'always', 'Hunt', 'fight', 'way', 'fight', 'countless', 'action', 'scenes', 'involve', 'freelance', 'climb', 'side', 'mountain', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'movie', 'history', 'brilliant', 'ending', 'battle', 'Cruise', 'Scott', 'complete', 'motorcycles', 'slew', 'other', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'espionage', 'stuff', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'totally', 'absorbing.Tom', 'Cruise', 'as', 'much', 'dislike', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'film', 'carried', 'perfect', 'fit', 'three', 'films', 'arrogance', 'balanced', 'beautifully', 'dedication', 'layers', 'humanity', 'given', 'here', 'matter', 'how', 'forced', 'times', 'play', 'off', 'nicely', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'perfect', 'villain', 'hate', 'pretty', 'much', 'disappeared', 'stint', 'Ever', 'saw', 'heartthrob', 'written', 'then', 'did', 'saw', 'versatility', 'really', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'everywhere', 'Sadly', 'kind', 'just', 'went', 'away', 'Thandie', 'Newton', ""n't"", 'gone', 'anywhere', ""'m"", 'happy', 'totally', 'hit', 'miss', 'when', 'here', 'unforgettable.So', 'as', 'good', 'DePalma', 'masterpiece', 'No', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'original', 'own', 'three', 'varying', 'degrees', 'feel', 'third', 'film', 'tried', 'hard', 'mix', 'plot', 'depth', 'original', 'action', 'style', 'Woo', 'uneven', 'effect', 'Hoffman', 'seethingly', 'brilliant', 'reason', 'enough', 'see', 'film']",N/A

But, John Woo is the true star here. Tom Cruise is not an action star. He's not. Even in the clip from the trailer, where Cruise does a roundabout kick, and on the way up, his cheeks trailing the rest of his face, Tom looks out of place. But John Woo actually makes him look good.The acting isn't that great. Ving Rhames is great, reprising his role as Luther. His entrance to the movie picks up the pace and the entertainment. Newcomer Thandie Newton, playing Nyah, Cruise and Scott's love interest in the film, works well. She's absolutely beautiful, with the looks of Catherine Zeta-Jones. She also is very believable at points. But Cruise is very disappointing - his smile looks more like a &quot;I'm going to be making 50-80 mil&quot; instead of a real smile. In many areas, he didn't seem to put in any effort at all, and then at times overacted for the film. The guy has come of Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, two acting-based films, and to make the switch to action is tough.But in the end, who cares? It's John Woo - who is truly a genius. His movies never fail to entertain, and guess what? Mission: Impossible 2 delivers.

522221,A351XMJF8DCD8Z,B00003CXDF,"bart ""wwfrockfan""","[0, 1]","I remember when this film was first released.  I didn't get a chance to see this film in theaters nor did I really care to.  I had seen the first M:I, and although I thought it was a fairly decent film, I didn't think it was anything to brag about.  When I saw previews for M:I-2, it really had me at confusion.  The film didn't seem to resemble anything of the first film.  While the first one was more targeted towards adults, this one was clearly aiming for a younger audience.  Naturally, I thought this movie was going to be dumb and that is exactly what I thought when I finally saw it.  I was 13 yrs old, I really did not understand anything that was going on-just something about a disease and all the action scenes that were already overplayed in the tons of commercials I saw for the movie.  After I saw it, I told everybody from that point on to ignore this one.That was back in 2001.  Its 2007 and I am now 19 yrs old.  M:I-3 has now been made which I thought was an incredibly awesome movie.  Not that long ago one of my friends and I were having a conversation about all sorts of movies.  We just happened to come accross this one.  I told him how M:I and M:I-3 were really good, and M:I-2 was bad.  He on the other hand admitted that he actually liked the 2nd one.  Seeing is how it was yrs since I saw M:I-2, I didn't really remember much except what I mentioned above.  So I started checking up on it again.  I saw the trailer on youtube and to my surprise, it looked pretty good.  Not long afterwards, the movie came on TNT.  Obviousely I watched and surprisingly enough, I enjoyed Very Much!!  While it does not live up to M:I-3, it definetly earned a spot on my favorite movies list.  Here's the plot.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called into action when a fellow IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Douggray Scott) has gone rogue.  Ambrose has stolen a deadly biologically engineered virus known as Chimera, a virus that kills your red blood cells if infected.  There is a cure called Valeraphon which can only save a persons if treated within 20 years.  However, after 20 hours, nothing can save.  Hunt with the help a thief, Nyah Nordaf Hall (Thandie Newton) they must infiltrate and find out what Ambrose's plans are for the virus.  Hunt must also at the same time dig deeper into discovering the truth about why this disease was created in the first place.That basically says it.  Just to add a few more things, although I actually like this movie now, I stil believe its the weakest of the M:I's.  It surprises me very much that of all of them, this was grossed the most money.  I think the real problem with this film is the very fact that it tries too hard to be ""cool"".  First lets start off with the ridiculous concepts- Tom Cruise rock climbing with no gear except powder for his hands, his mission being assigned through sunglasses, the car chase with Thandie Newton (there was no suspense and the characters appear to be having fun).  Then theres the action scenes.  I know John Woo has his style but I think it was a bit overdone.  Too many quick cuts and overuse of explosions.  Then theres all the rock music in the film, I do not think that was necessary.  And then there's Tom Cruise's look with the long wavy hair.  I really think his hair was like that to make this movie seem ""cool"".  I am sure the original M""I series would never have had these elements.  I really think this film would have been alot better if it were its own movie rather than an M:I.  Well anyway, I still suggest.  But if anyone has a chance, definetly check out M:I-3.

Couch,"[1, 2]","Let me first say that I like Tom Cruise as an actor very much- he is in 2 of my favorite films (Magnolia and Jerry Maguire) and having met him can say first-hand that he is a gracious person and doesn't seem to do things only for the paycheck. So it is hard to explain what all of this movie was. I love John Woo; Dougray Scott is a fine actor, Thandie Newton is appropriate... it's just that THERE WAS NO SCRIPT WITHIN 5 MILES OF THIS MOVIE. I still find it amazing that with all the considerations made for various things in a movie, the script seems to be the thing least paid attention to. What did this movie cost, $100 million+? It had to, because it looked great and that's it. I don't expect the equivalent of MI1, but this is plain terrible. MI1 was EXCELLENT- took a while to figure out what was going on, but very fun! This one uses the things that made the 1st one cool, like the realistic masks, etc. to cover coincidences or plot holes... very dissapointing.

The sequel is very good, but it just couldn't live up to the success of its predecessor. This is probably because of minor irratations throughout the movie. First, with Tom Cruise playing a bigger role behind the cameras this time, a lot of the movie is focused on him. M:I-2 also uses slow-motion way too much. Some of the action scenes would have been way better if it weren't for this. But enough criticism, I didn't give this movie four stars for nothing.The storyline in the sequal is very unique (and not nearly as confusing). The premise is simple; a bio-medical engineer has created a super-virus that only he himself has the cure to. When the virus gets into the wrong hands, it is up to Cruise to prevent a world-wide breakout. Woo did a stellar job on the action scenes in M:I-2, as well. Everybody will also be relieved to hear that the storyline is a lot easier to understand this time. There are still a lot of old fasioned plot twists this time, but they are explained much better.All in all its a solid movie.

I think he's really done his best work with this movie. The plot is simple and straightforward, unlike the somewhat labyrinthine story in MI1, and Woo does a nice job of building up toward a torrent of wild, insane action sequences.Tom Cruise is impressive in his second bout as spy, Ethan Hunt, heir apparent to the role of Mission Impossible team leader. Most impressive about Cruise is that he performed about 90% of his own stunts in this film, many of them quite dangerous. The motorcycle chase has got to be one of the all-time great chase scenes in movies. The DVD version has a nice bonus feature showing how some of the more wild stunts in the movie were put together. Really fun stuff to watch if you're interested in the process of making movies. The DVD also has commentary and a &quot;Making of MI2&quot; featurette that round out the package.Ving Rhames returns as computer hacker, Luther, and the beautiful Thandie Newton plays Hunt's femme fatale.If you like a good, smart action film, MI2 is the ticket.

Thankfully, that theme was resurrected in this film.I was so disappointed in the first film that, if not for the fact that John Woo directed this one, I wouldn't have bothered to see it.  John Woo's involvement pushed this movie to heights it wouldn't have achieved otherwise.  The stunts were amazing, the motorcycle chase scene was one of the best I've ever scene, and the fight scene in the end was full of tension and realistically done.  Mr. Woo has taken the action genre to new levels of achievement.  He is THE director to watch these days and you can see his influence in other films.The one shortcoming of this film was bad dialogue.  Not that the film was filled with it, but rather that there were scenes here and there where the characters didn't seem to interact naturally and the dialogue was way too cheesy.  Now, I have no problem with cheesiness when it's intentional (a la Schwarzenegger movies), but it really had no place in this film.  Other than that, this film was a blast to watch.

Marsh,"[0, 1]","For my box office money, Year 2000 was one of the worst ever, with a plethora of bloated, overlong, overrated flicks (&quot;Gladiator,&quot; &quot;Cast Away,&quot; &quot;What Lies Beneath,&quot; &quot;The Patriot,&quot; &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;). Though not by any means a great movie, &quot;M:I-2&quot; rises to the top of my memory almost by default. It's dumb, but at least it's fast and entertaining.John Woo knows how to stage, direct and photograph action sequences, and it's a good thing his star, Tom Cruise, knows how to act in them and even how to perform many of his own stunts. &quot;M:I-2&quot; wisely conserves the wildest action for about the last 45 minutes, beginning with Cruise's daring penetration of a high-rise and ending with probably the longest fistfight sequence in history.I didn't believe a minute of this silly, slick, superficial piece of eye candy. The good thing is, Woo and Cruise don't ask us to. They intend only to seduce us with surface level charm. They succeed, brilliantly. Here is an action movie that takes the effort to find poetry in its visuals, like the extended scene that introduces Cruise's affable spy, Ethan Hunt, to the femme fatale, Nyah, played fetchingly by the alluring Thandie Newton. It's a flirtatious dance with larceny at its core, taken to a new level by the mountaintop car chase, another dance that leads eventually to physical passion. We may not care about Ethan and Nyah, but wow, they look great together.Much of &quot;M:I-2&quot; is over the top and ridiculous, and a lot of the dialogue is banal, taking us from Point A to Point B. But Woo finds all sorts of ways to make the movie interesting without dialogue. Maybe the best news of all is that this never, for a moment, feels like a sequel, thankfully because Cruise intends each entry in the franchise to feel like a brand-new, standalone film (never mind the numeral in the title). Think what Tarantino could do with this material.&quot;Think.&quot; Now there's a word you don't want anywhere near &quot;M:I-2.&quot; At least this movie has the courage to live up to its own mindlessness.

522258,A13RM1AWD1C5ZR,B00003CXDF,Daniel K.,"[0, 0]","M:I-2 was a fine action film, of course it was made by John Woo so it was sure to offer solid action thrills.  Woo as always crafts superb action sequences which are intense and suspenseful.  The film featured an excellent motorcyle chase which was near the end, probably one of the best bike chases next to Woo's other film ""Paycheck"" which featured another greatbike chase.  The one thing that sets this film apart from the first is the action, sure the plot for the first was probably better and the first probably made more sense, but this movie should be a satisfying one just for the action.As for the plot well it's decent.  Essentially a deadly virus called chimera is unleashed and is extremely lethal.  He must stop an evil renegade agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott)from unleashing this terror upon the world.  He must recruit Ambrose's ex-lover Nyal Hall (Thandie Newton)to assist him on the case in order to lure Ambrose into a trap and stop the virus chimera from spread on to the world.  Sure the plot may not be that compelling or so it sounds, but like I said you don't have to worry about that especially if you're an die-hard action fan.  Also the always amazing Anthony Hopkins comes in as Hunt's boss and advisor.Tom Cruise gives a certain edge to role of Ethan Hunt and he sure does play it well.  I must say I do prefer this installment over the first Mission Impossible, is it the action or the action?  Who knows?M:I-2 is rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Violent Actionand Some Sensuality.  The violence includes gunplay, fistfights and explosions.  The sexual content is mild, mainly some innuendo nothing explicit or graphic really.  No profanity.Ethan Hunt in a way is an American version of James Bond, he's got the girl, the gadgets (nowhere near as sophisticated or cool as Bond's though) and the ride.  If you like John Woo, I highly recommend this one, definetly for the action, the breathtaking bike chase to an intense climactic fight between Cruise and Scott.

And he's succeeded on all fronts, but to the detrimate of the film.  You needn't be worried about getting lost in the story because it's so simple that even a child could navigate it's way through, which in light of Congressional discoveries could've been their (Paramount's) target audience all along.  There's a good side to this though.  After all, how often do you hear a gasp followed by &quot;Plausible!&quot; instead of &quot;Cool!&quot;  The rational is that by relaxing on the plot we can justify settling in and enjoying it for what it is - a popcorn movie.  This way the director doesn't have to concern himself with the little details, like 'why does Tom Cruise put on a pair of sunglasses amidst an intense action sequence?'  The story (or what there is of it) revolves around Ethan Hunt and his beautiful accomplice (Newton) who's mostly just window-dressing, though I think she was intented to be more.  Hunt's nemisis - an Aussie baddie hot after an Ebola-like virus and it's cure, in hopes of extorting millions from a chemist who plans on unleashing the virus and cashing in on the antidote.  It's sounds deeper than it really is, as in one scene it's asked if it's that simple and a smirking Tom replys, &quot;Why not?&quot;  Why not indeed.

Here we  have an obvious remake of Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Notorious&quot;.  However, while the great Al was a master of suspense, John Woo, for all his  charms as a director, surpasses suspenseful dialogue and slow panning  camera shots and arrives at pure boredom. This movie drags so badly you'd  think it was carry two tons of bricks up a steep hill.Then the supposed  love story. I think it was intended to be between the Tom Cruise and  Thandie Newton characters. Hmmm. Really, I suspect the true love story was  between Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise. What, as producer did he get to say Hey  guys, for this film I'm going to sport a terrible haircut and have 81  million close-ups of me looking &quot;intense&quot;? Puh-lease. The worst  of it had to be in the beginning, when he depicted Ethan Hunt performing a  self-crucifixion while rock climbing. Okay, he's supposed to be saintly, we  get it already!And the action sequences. The movie definitely had it's  share of cool shots, but they seemed so overdone. John Woo's brilliance in  this genre is so strong it doesn't need such a high degree of digital  touch-ups. Finally, why bother to pay such brilliant actors as Anthony  Hopkins and Ving Rhames if you're only going to hide them behind lame  dialogue and uninteresting scenes?I suppose there is merit in this film  for it's advertising scheme.

Even when I was a kid, I thought SUPERMAN II outsoared the original for action.When you sit down to watch an action film, you have to remember to judge if for what kind of an action film it is.  Immediately, you have to be prepared to suspend some disbelief and keep the possibilities open.  Is the plot even somewhat intelligent?  Is the acting any good?  Is the action in-your-face-relentless without being too stupid?  My answer for MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 2 is an unequivelled ""yes"" to all of them.The plot takes on a more James Bond-ish approach, with Tom Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, out to stop a former MI agent from releasing a deadly virus on the population of Australia.  With him, is his ""Bond girl-ish"" sidekick and damsel in distress, Nia, played by Thandie Newton.  Combined with the hardcore action of director John Woo, you cannot help but enjoy this film.  The spectacular motorcycle sequence alone is worth your time.The acting is as good as it can get for an action film.  Some lines stick out favorably like, ""Well, Mr. Hunt, this isn't Mission Difficult.  This is Mission Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you."" and ""That punk put a hole in my Versache!"" oh, and my personal favorite:""She doesn't have the experience for a job like this.""""What, to go to bed with a man and lie to him?  She's a woman, she has all the experience she needs.""Sorry, ladies, I'm not sexist, but it IS funny.Tom Crusie movies, for me, have always been a guilty pleasure.

Put it this way, if you enjoyed the first M:I for its emphasis on teamwork and convoluted storytelling, then don't even bother with the sequel, as the credited director John Woo should give you a damn good idea of what to expect.Tom Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, our intrepid spy who now appears to have a knack for rock climbing and martial arts. His assignment is to recruit thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to go undercover for the agency to spy on renegade agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his formidable army of henchmen. Ambrose has plans of becoming a billionaire, but in doing so, could cause great devastation to the population of Australia. Naturally, it's up to Hunt to rescue the girl, kill the bad guy, and save the day.Through and through, M:I-II never feels like anything less than a Woo production. Almost all his signatures are here: balletic slow motion, two-fisted guns a'blazing, flying doves, and a sort-of Mexican standoff. The only thing missing here is the countless gallons of blood we've come to expect. M:I-II, as it turns out, is his first and only PG-13 production, but the lack of ultraviolence didn't bother me in the slightest.What is less forgivable is the almost utter lack of action in the first seventy minutes. Well, that's not entirely true. There is that climbing sequence and the car chase not long thereafter, but Cruise doesn't even stand off against his first true nemesis until after an hour in. What's to hold our attention until then? Maybe the plot, if you're into typical Bond stuff, which is exactly what this story is, typical Bond material. We've got the almost megalomaniacal villain (he doesn't want the world, but he wouldn't mind devastating parts of it to get what he wants), the gorgeous love interests, and a few neat gadgets here and there.When the action hits, M:I-II is almost a non-stop action extravaganza, delivering tense gun battles, a breathtaking and simply awesome motorcycle chase (one of my favorite John Woo action scenes), and a fun mano-a-mano duel to the death. Cruise is completely convincing as a physical action star, he's got the style, the charisma, and the moves. He's the star of the show, which might disgust some, but he capably carries the production. Newton makes for a gorgeous love interest, and Ving Rhames is THE man as Luther Stickell, everyone's favorite computer hacker. Dougray Scott disappoints as the villain, though, he doesn't conjure enough spite and isn't menacing enough.From beginning to end, if there is one consistency to M:I-II, it's how lovely the film looks. Shot on beautiful locations with a great eye, this is a movie that's always nice to look at. As such, the film should be enjoyed for what it is, an action blockbuster in the vein of James Bond. Sure, it probably could have used a tad more action in the first half and Woo does go overboard on the slow-mo by the finale, but M:I-II is purely fun stuff, and when the action's on-screen, it's exhilarating.",4,An exception to the &quot;mis-directed Woo&quot; rule.,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,3263,"['Maybe', 'was', 'was', 'mood', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'thriller', 'maybe', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'film', 'first', 'place', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'II', 'satisfied', 'craving', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'basis', 'alone', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Put', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'M', 'emphasis', 'teamwork', 'convoluted', 'storytelling', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'sequel', 'credited', 'director', 'John', 'Woo', 'should', 'give', 'damn', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'expect.Tom', 'Cruise', 'returns', 'IMF', 'agent', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'intrepid', 'spy', 'who', 'now', 'have', 'knack', 'rock', 'climbing', 'martial', 'arts', 'assignment', 'recruit', 'thief', 'Nyah', 'Hall', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'go', 'undercover', 'agency', 'spy', 'renegade', 'agent', 'Sean', 'Ambrose', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'formidable', 'army', 'henchmen', 'Ambrose', 'plans', 'becoming', 'billionaire', 'doing', 'so', 'could', 'cause', 'great', 'devastation', 'population', 'Australia', 'Naturally', 'up', 'Hunt', 'rescue', 'girl', 'kill', 'bad', 'guy', 'save', 'day.Through', 'M', 'I-II', 'never', 'feels', 'anything', 'less', 'Woo', 'production', 'Almost', 'signatures', 'are', 'here', 'balletic', 'slow', 'motion', 'two-fisted', 'guns', ""a'blazing"", 'flying', 'doves', 'sort-of', 'Mexican', 'standoff', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'here', 'countless', 'gallons', 'blood', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'M', 'I-II', 'out', 'first', 'only', 'PG-13', 'production', 'lack', 'ultraviolence', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'slightest.What', 'less', 'forgivable', 'almost', 'utter', 'lack', 'action', 'first', 'seventy', 'minutes', 'Well', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'climbing', 'sequence', 'car', 'chase', 'not', 'long', 'thereafter', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'off', 'first', 'true', 'nemesis', 'hour', 'What', 'hold', 'attention', 'then', 'Maybe', 'plot', ""'re"", 'typical', 'Bond', 'stuff', 'exactly', 'what', 'story', 'typical', 'Bond', 'material', ""'ve"", 'got', 'almost', 'megalomaniacal', 'villain', ""n't"", 'want', 'world', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'devastating', 'parts', 'get', 'what', 'gorgeous', 'love', 'interests', 'few', 'neat', 'gadgets', 'here', 'there.When', 'action', 'M', 'I-II', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'action', 'extravaganza', 'delivering', 'tense', 'gun', 'battles', 'breathtaking', 'simply', 'awesome', 'motorcycle', 'chase', 'one', 'favorite', 'John', 'Woo', 'action', 'scenes', 'fun', 'mano-a-mano', 'duel', 'death', 'Cruise', 'completely', 'convincing', 'physical', 'action', 'star', 'got', 'style', 'charisma', 'moves', 'star', 'show', 'might', 'disgust', 'capably', 'production', 'Newton', 'gorgeous', 'love', 'interest', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'THE', 'man', 'Luther', 'Stickell', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'computer', 'hacker', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'disappoints', 'villain', 'though', ""n't"", 'conjure', 'enough', 'spite', ""n't"", 'menacing', 'enough.From', 'beginning', 'end', 'one', 'consistency', 'M', 'I-II', 'how', 'lovely', 'film', 'Shot', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'great', 'eye', 'movie', 'always', 'nice', 'look', 'such', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'vein', 'James', 'Bond', 'Sure', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'tad', 'more', 'action', 'first', 'half', 'Woo', 'go', 'overboard', 'slow-mo', 'finale', 'M', 'I-II', 'purely', 'fun', 'stuff', 'when', 'action', 'on-screen', 'exhilarating']",N/A

I bought it and absolutely loved it.  I watch it again and again.  Tom Cruise plays one of his best acting roles ever in Mission Impossible 2 playing the role as &quot;the good guy&quot; against &quot;the bad guys&quot; in this action packed thriller.I was just blown away from the special effects and time the producers put into this film to create such a great movie.  The fight scenes are phenomenal and as real as you can get them, the explosions are as great as you can ever see, and the gunshots and wounds are so life-like.  Sometimes I feel like I'm actually there.Tom Cruise probably already knows that he did an awesome job but he should be congradulated once again by a long-time fan.  He got into his character so much in the movie that I just couldn't believe that it was him.I honestly have to say that any action movie fans or just fans of great movies should really check this one out.  Not only does it feature a great cast and great crew, but it also features spectacular special affects and fight scenes.&quot;Mission Impossible 2&quot; is the most &quot;real&quot; movie that I have ever seen.

522291,A3L8PEHENBZXI2,B00003CXDF,Eye In Sky,"[1, 2]","Although I can sympathize with reviewers who rated this movie poorly, it is evident the majority of negative responses are from those unfamiliar with John Woo. Very few times will I dare say the story might be secondary to the ""heart"" of a movie. This rarity only occurs when the source of that enjoyment comes from something above and beyond what the average moviegoer can experience.Here is a case when the director is the actual ""star"" of the film. There is truly a magic with nearly all of his movies (we'll forget about Broken Arrow or Windtalkers for the time being) that no matter how implausible or phony the plot may be, there is such a majestic quality to Woo's art that one can't help but be amazed at what is being shown on screen.  Those familiar with some of his best ones (like his Chinese films Hardboiled & The Killer) are very aware of his trademarks.  These trademarks are not subtle in the least, but unless you know exactly what you *should* be looking for, you may feel lost (Did you ever wonder why a few select people in the theater loudly cheered during odd moments- like when a white dove was flying away in elaborate slow motion?).It is unfortunate that watching Woo's previous works is sort of a prerequisite. There literally isn't one second that goes by without Woo's fingerprints everywhere. A similar example of how powerful a fan base can boost popularity are those who like Jackie Chan. His films are notorious for bad writing, terrible dialogue, and questionable acting.  Still, Jackie Chan became a popular icon across the world because of what his talent really is about.  Fans of Jackie Chan would feel cheated if it didn't showcase his insane death-defying stunts or his comical drawn-out fight scenes no matter how good the writing, dialogue, and acting may be.Likewise, I must also grant this movie is purely cheap popcorn entertainment and should not be compared to other well written masterpieces like Schindler's List, The Sixth Sense, Memento, or American Beauty. MI:2 can, and should be compared to other movies of the action/spy genre.

Esteve ""Franco""","[1, 2]","John Woo disappoints again (another previous disappointment being Broken Arrow) by making a big budget movie with a very slow and badly realized screenplay. This movie seems like it wants to be too many cliches, and departs so much from the original Mission Impossible concept as to be deemed a James Bond wannabe. It does have some of those awesome action scenes one would expect from Woo, but many of these, unfortunately suffer from pointlessness.The relationship between Cruise and Ms. Newton is a nice addition to the story as it brings a very human aspect to Cruise's character development, but it detracts from the orginal concept, making it look (dare I say it again), more Bondish, in it's one main super character and a babe against the world type of formula. This makes for relatively slow and boring cinema, and it's a true shame. It is a shame to see so much talent wasted on this script (i.e. Anthony Hopkins in a very poorly written cameo).In conclusion, this movie doesn't know what it really wants to be. The first movie was better executed with a better script. If you enjoy John Woo films, it certainly has the shots and the action although more pointless and limited than in other films of his. I recommend that you rent this movie first, and if you really must have it, then buy it.

The malarkey they want us to swallow is so utterly impossible that this film could easily be one of the most laughable movies of 2000.  Fifty bad guys shoot 10,000 bullets at Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) with automatic weapons, but never even wing him.  Hunt, armed only with pistols, kills a bad guy with every bullet he fires, often killing them three at a time while somersaulting through the air.John Woo (Broken Arrow, Face/Off) is a veteran of action adventure films and his expertise in this area is evident throughout the film.  It contains stupendous action sequences throughout, though I thought Woo's attempt to turn Tom Cruise into Jackie Chan was a bit much.  Woo also chose some breathtaking locations and the photography was first rate.Ronald Moore's (Star Trek: Generations) story was an utterly unoriginal excuse to keep half of Hollywood's stunt actors employed.  The screenplay by Robert Towne (Bonnie and Clyde, Chinatown, Armageddon) was even worse.  The dialogue was wretched.  If one more character ripped off his face, I would have stomped the DVD.The acting was nothing special.  Cruise really had nothing intelligent to say or do, so the best I can say about him is that he was in great shape and showed us what a good athlete he is.  Thandie Newton (Beloved) was initially very dynamic and sassy, but by the end of the film, she was reduced to a quivering jellyfish.

I wanted to see what I liked about it and the film holds up remarkably well.MI-2 features the creative and extravagant pairing of Tom Cruise and John Woo (more explosions! more cars!). Their signature presence is evident in every shot.  Robert Towne's script, though no doubt rewritten, is actually tight with strong dialogue and a solid plot.  In short, the film works well on all fronts.  It doesn't force viewers to think or understand what the problem is - it just gets on with it, unlike many movies that try too hard to be cerebral and clever.  People clamouring for the original Brian DePalma Mission Impossible film (which I found convoluted) will never like the subsequent MI-2 and 3 efforts which veered more into James Bond action popcorn territory.Considering Woo's mixed experiences in Hollywood, MI-2 is actually one of his most polished efforts.  In spite of a couple of schticky moments which many people find justifiably hokey (I just had to watch the Audi-Porsche car spinning sequence again) - the film doesn't try to take itself too seriously WHICH IS THE POINT. Critics of Tom Cruise and John Woo will never fully enjoy the film, because of Cruise's cheeseball grin, and Woo's stylistic quirks.  But put away those issues, and excuse the signature doves flying around, and you have a thrill-a-minute film.The casting of Thandie Newton and Dougray Scott makes the film even more intriguing, and puts MI-2 above many other films of this genre that almost reach for this but never make it.  As an action film, this has some amazing shots that deserve kudos.The DVD extras are extensive and a good primer for anyone interested in how to do an action film. There are good interviews with the director and stunt supervisors.  There's also a hilarious mockumentary with Ben Stiller from the MTV Movie Awards spoofing Tom Cruise as ""Tom Crooze.""MI-2 is underrated.  Watch it and enjoy it.

What you should expect to see is of course good action, good cinematography, cheesy one-liners, and good special fx - which this film has in spades.So if you don't like action movies, then you won't like this one (I would've thought that was obvious, but some people have a rough time with it).This is the most skillfully-made action movie in the past 10 years - or since Hard Boiled, though Desperado definitely gives it a run for its money - and Kill Bill has now topped MI2, but that's my opinion :P.Good action movies are hard to come by and few people appreciate them, either because they insist that every film should be art (in its defined form) and/or that in order for a movie to be good it must succeed on every area (i.e. acting, cinematography, dialogue, etc.). I agree with these and truely enjoy well-thoughtout and artsy movies (Glengary Glenross, Taxi Driver, The Man Who Fell to Earth, Memento, Adaptation, too many to list).

It keeps you entertained from start to finish, and it does pretty well in other ways. The story is still pretty good, nowhere near as good as the first one, but it's still good. Some people may say that the save-the-world theme is old, but that's what action movies are about. Give me one James Bond film where 007 didn't do that. Give me any other action movie without that theme. Lord of the Rings had it. Star Wars had it. So does the fact that M:I-2's story revolves around someone saving the world make the movie bad? No way! It's the kind of plot that makes an action movie an action movie. Moving on. Like others have stated, the purpose of action in these movies is not to seem totally realistic, but to be really entertaining and fun to watch. Actually, it still is pretty realistic. What's all this junk about Ethan hitting all his shots (Which is pretty unrealistic, I'll admit)? Didn't any of you watch the Biocyte shootout? How many of his shots hit one of Ambrose's men? Maybe a quarter of them! He's still human and has down-to-earth abilities, not completely unrealistic superhuman stuff that a lot of people criticize. And besides, until the road chase, it is perfectly reasonable that Ethan didn't get shot! Half the time he was behind a wall or lurking in the shadows, waiting for the moment to go Splinter Cell on a patrolling guard. Anyway, sorry I lingered. The acting in this movie is great. Tom Cruise gives Ethan Hunt a very human qualities. Thandie Newton, who plays Nyah Hall, also does the same for her character. Ving Rhames returns to the comic-relief character Luther (the brilliant computer programmer from M:I),  and continues to give Luther the comical humor from the first movie. John Polson is introduced as the Australian helicopter pilot Billy Baird, and also gives a lot of humor to the movie.  And by the way, both Rhames and Polson do a great job of acting besides the humor, and bring the characters to life very well. Dougray Scott is the villain in this movie, and does it very nicely. He gives Sean Ambrose the kind of madman look and nicely combines it with cold-blooded intelligence to make the character a very good villain. And finally, Anthony Hopkins is Ethan's new leader, and does a very good support role. What about the music? Well, if you've seen the first movie, the music is just the same with a little metallic feel to it. And if you haven't, then don't worry, you won't be dissapointed.

Which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex. There's just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain. Dougray Scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of Scottish actors.John Woo uses some wonderful Australian scenery but fails to inject any sense of excitement to the fight scenes. The gun battles look too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow-motion, which robs them of any realism or hardcore. Seeing as how this is a PG-13 the action is also pretty damn tame. Which is a shame since Woo is a pro at this. You hardly see any bullets even enter bad guys never mind exit. It's all done off screen. If people wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire Woo to direct? It's a bit puzzling.Although it IS tame it is still darker and harder than the original. But the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap. I can't believe Robert Towne had a hand in writing this. It's like a rejected plot to a Solid Snake PS1 game. There's seems to be some focus on making it a James Bond/Die Hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces.Another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is Zimmer's score. For a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music. Zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music. But NONE of that is present in MI-2. This was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass-produced soulless stuff.

The point is that it is well built, entertaining and extremely credible which makes the action all the more acceptable. The acting is also extremely good with a brilliant Tom Cruise. But the film has some depth, some real depth. We are speaking here of terrorism, but the type that comes from global criminals. They are white, European or American, and they only aim at making a lot of money by forcing some not-too-ethical businessmen spit out much money under the pressure of some blackmail, though this blackmail leads these businessmen to making even more money than they are forced to spit out. A  gentleman's agreement  in a way. This type of crime, of terrorism is common and frequent, but most of the time unknown and even well hidden. The topic of the film is even more uptodate than we may imagine. A pharmaceutical firm invents a killing germ and the drug that can stop it. The objective is quite obviously to release the germ into the public in order to sell the drug. But a criminal gets his hands on both the germ and the drug and then can blackmail the businessman. This denunciation of pharmaceutical firms is not unique and it plays on the fear among the public that some new disease should appear and kill millions of people. We know about AIDS. We know about the SRAS. We know about Mad Cow disease. But do we know everything ? That is particularly frightening, though the film tries to reassure us by showing some people who fight against this, even to the death if necessary.

From the opening unrealistic scene of Tom Cruise mountain climbing and jumping from rock to rock in the arizona desert you knew this movie was all about Cruise.  Jump to Cruise chasing after some beautiful woman in a fast car (completely ripped off from James Bond) and he of course he falls in love with her 5 minutes after he gets her in the sack.  And shock shock his boss needs Cruise to 'use' her to get his man.  Now we get to see the anguished Cruise, followed by the superhero action Cruise.Why even bother naming this movie Mission Impossible?  It was cocktail/top gun/days of thunder with high tech gadgets.  Last I checked the actual series and even the first movie was supposed to be about a team.  There were at least three requisite pulling off the fake face routine and by the third time not only was there no suspense it was obvious for even a third grader to figure out.As far as the directing is concerned, yes John Woo is a great director, but he must have shot half the movie in slow motion which made the movie seem ponderous and self indulgent.  It's incredible that off all the movies John Woo made this is the only one that is obviously controlled by the star, and the funny thing is I like a lot of Tom Cruise movies.

The first one was cerebral and bizarre at times, succeeding at not making itself clear in some scenes, typical of Brian De Palma films that usually fall flat at the end.  It can be surmised that when Tom Cruise, who served as producer on the first and second film realized the lack of excitement in the first one, he wanted to make sure the action scenes in the sequel would be spectacular.He succeeded by hiring John Woo as the director.  Woo's claim to fame is action movies, doing such adrenaline pumped hits as Face/Off, Broken Arrow and several high energy Hong Kong actions flicks.  Unfortunately, the story's IQ was shaved in order to counter the fear that people might this one confusing too.  The MI TV series was always like a bad dream, you never knew what could happen next or who you could trust.  Although the first MI followed that pattern, the second one throws it out the window.  The villain is made clear from the beginning...sort of.The plot is typical Spy thriller stuff; Mega virus is stolen, secret government agents go after the man who has it, wackiness ensues in the form of killer actions scenes and the hero saves the day.  No one is called on to do any kind of stretch of their acting chops.  One main complaint I have is the forced romance between Ethan and Nyah (a prominent Jewel thief played by the smoldering Thandie Newton).  The two have no chemistry.  This is unfortunate because I like them as a couple, but there isn't much to like between them on screen.The movie is simple and the action scenes are awesome if not bordering on absurd.  I give Cruise high praise and credit for beefing up and doing almost all of his own stunt work and fight scenes, it's quite convincing.  Especially the rock climbing scene at the beginning, the motorcycle chase and the climatic fight scene at the end.

Boy was I right and everyone else out there who predicted the same. I understand that movies are here for us to enjoy. But I predicted 98% of this film. The chase on the mountain with the car was ok but the motorcycle chase was totally unbelievable. Cruise is not at all believeable enough, to be able to flip a gun up in the air from the sand with his foot like he did at the end. I did not enjoy this film from the begining.

Tom did ruin the Mission Impossible though franchise by making everything about just one guy instead of a team like the tv series. Like I said in my Mission Impossible 1 review, he's a pure ego actor that made everything about Ethan Hunt who he happens to play. I don't even think Ethan was in the tv serries. Jim was the main guy and in the first film they made him turn bad.While the first was all brains, this one hardly has any. It's a pure"" look at me I'm Tom Cruise film"". It's just him showing off for 2 hours. If you saw the maing of part 3 on Spike TV where Tom talks the making of all 3 films, he basically takes credit for everything! While talking about part 2 he says ""it was my idea to have the knife come extremely close to my eye because that was never done in film before"". He's such a know it all that's so into himself. Mission Impossible is supposed to be about teams working together in secret missions and since he produces the movies eveything is about him.Tom wants each Mission Impossible to be different with a different director each time. That's probably the only idea of his I really like. Here John Woo directs and yes he made a bad Mission Impossible movie but managed to make a fun stunt show of a movie. The whole plot is basically about Tom falling for a women who's going to be used for a secret mission. They wanna use her since she used to go out with the main villian. The whole movie is basically about him trying to save her....so they can hold hands at the end to some sweet music when you know he'll just have a new g/f in part 3.Dougray Scott (Heist, Dark Water) at least adds some coolness to the film as the villian. He probably should've chose playing Wolverine in X-Men instead of doing this though. Instead he was replaced by Hugh Jackman and it did wonders for Jackman's career. While Dougray Scott is barely seen in a movies and his show Heist was cancelled already. At least he was one of the better things about Mission Impossible 2. It's nice seeing Anthony Hopkins in the film too as Ethan's boss eventhough he's sorta wasted.John Woo wasn't the best choice for a MI film since his direction is either too stylish with too much slow motion and close-ups. Brian De Palma at least focused on the plot. Woo and Cruise here just care about action shots and what looks cool. I can see why people hate the film but I still I find it hard to. It's a not a bad escape movie. You wanna get away from your problems, you can throw it with some surround sound and still have  a  good time. Like I said it's a stunt show and that's about it. I Plan on seeing part 3 today and hopefully that one has action and...a brain unlike this film which just has action.",4,A Fun Stunt Show,1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,2804,"['think', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'hard', 'film', 'Yes', 'worse', '3', 'films', 'still', 'really', 'Tom', 'did', 'ruin', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'franchise', 'making', 'everything', 'about', 'just', 'one', 'guy', 'instead', 'team', 'tv', 'series', 'said', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '1', 'review', 'pure', 'ego', 'actor', 'made', 'everything', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'who', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'Ethan', 'was', 'tv', 'serries', 'Jim', 'was', 'main', 'guy', 'first', 'film', 'made', 'turn', 'first', 'was', 'brains', 'one', 'hardly', 'pure', 'look', ""'m"", 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'film', 'just', 'showing', 'off', '2', 'hours', 'saw', 'maing', 'part', '3', 'Spike', 'TV', 'where', 'Tom', 'making', '3', 'films', 'basically', 'credit', 'everything', 'talking', 'part', '2', 'was', 'idea', 'have', 'knife', 'come', 'extremely', 'close', 'eye', 'was', 'never', 'done', 'film', 'such', 'know', 'so', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'supposed', 'be', 'teams', 'working', 'together', 'secret', 'missions', 'movies', 'eveything', 'him.Tom', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'be', 'different', 'different', 'director', 'time', 'probably', 'only', 'idea', 'really', 'Here', 'John', 'Woo', 'directs', 'yes', 'made', 'bad', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'movie', 'managed', 'make', 'fun', 'stunt', 'show', 'movie', 'whole', 'plot', 'basically', 'Tom', 'falling', 'women', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'used', 'secret', 'mission', 'wan', 'na', 'use', 'used', 'go', 'out', 'main', 'villian', 'whole', 'movie', 'basically', 'trying', 'save', 'can', 'hold', 'hands', 'end', 'sweet', 'music', 'when', 'know', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'new', 'g/f', 'part', '3.Dougray', 'Scott', 'Heist', 'Dark', 'Water', 'least', 'coolness', 'film', 'villian', 'probably', 'should', ""'ve"", 'chose', 'playing', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'instead', 'doing', 'Instead', 'was', 'replaced', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'did', 'wonders', 'Jackman', 'career', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'barely', 'seen', 'movies', 'show', 'Heist', 'was', 'cancelled', 'already', 'least', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'things', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'film', 'too', 'Ethan', 'boss', 'sorta', 'wasted.John', 'Woo', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'choice', 'MI', 'film', 'direction', 'either', 'too', 'stylish', 'too', 'much', 'slow', 'motion', 'close-ups', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'least', 'focused', 'plot', 'Woo', 'Cruise', 'here', 'just', 'care', 'action', 'shots', 'what', 'cool', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'hate', 'film', 'still', 'find', 'hard', 'not', 'bad', 'escape', 'movie', 'wan', 'na', 'get', 'away', 'problems', 'can', 'throw', 'surround', 'sound', 'still', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'said', 'stunt', 'show', 'Plan', 'seeing', 'part', '3', 'today', 'hopefully', 'one', 'action', 'brain', 'film', 'just', 'action']",N/A

The sound and picture quality as expected are much better than the VHS edition and really makes for a greater viewing experience.  I myself really enjoyed this movie and found that the story was much improved over the first movie.The character developements in MI2 are a considerable improvement over the first installment and the story moves along nicely.  The stunts are mind-boggling and the special effects are great.  This is in my opinon the best of John Woo's movies and as an action movie has a great story and plot to accompany the superb action.

I saw this ""movie"" when it came out in 2000 in the theatre.  I had seen the first Mission Impossible and was pleased.  This sequel is what is quintessentially wrong with Hollywood.  When a movie makes some money, immediately Hollywood wants to run out and make another one and rake in more bucks at the expense of good story telling.  I swear, if they could, they'd make a Titanic 2.(But what does this have to do with your review title?) We'll here it is.  I was so disappointed, so mad, so angry that this garbage made it to a movie theatre and charged ME over 8 bucks to see it, that 5 years after it came out, I'm still angry.  So angry I'm writing a review about how awful this mess is.  To put it another way, If I could travel to another dimension in time and space, the pain that watching this movie would cause, would still reach me.  So what am I talking about, exactly?  The last 15 minutes of the movie alone will make my point.  To be sure, this uber-toxic disease which required its first subject to be hospitalized, bed ridden with weeping soars and pustules, only causes our female hero a slight red eye and sniffly nose even though she has had the same level of exposure.  Tom Cruise can somehow kick a gun laterally, in the sand, have it ""pop up"" 3 feet in the air grab it, aim and fire at a low lying target (the villain) who already has a bead on Tom with gun fully loaded.  Tom gets off two shots and our villian can't hit the broad side of a barn. (lame isn't the word) The motorcycle scene when Tom (ethan hunt) is skidding on the ground with his feet (roller skates) and doesn't get thrown off his bike.  The director with his ""white doves"" nonsense as tom enters a room to shoot everybody as some sort of holier-than-thou-bad-ass.  If I ever met either tom cruise or john woo in real life, i'd demand they pay me the 20 bucks (ticket, popcorn and soda) that I shelled out for watching this garbage.  I'd also strap them to a chair and make them watch 2 hours of static and make them loose two hours of their lives.  Why am I writing this now? I saw all of 15 seconds of this awful movie, flipping through channels on cable and got angry that it was STILL being shown to the public and that nobody had filed ""crimes against humanity"" charges against the USA network.

522347,A23VGBG17K5NJ3,B00003CXDF,John Nolley II,"[0, 1]","Many fans of the television series found the first Mission: Impossible film to be a disappointing adaptation to the big screen.  The addition of legendary Honk Kong action film guru John Woo--still seeking a true breakthrough US hit--promised a better sequel than the original.The plot: a superbug whose science is a bit unplausible infects red blood cells and spreads a devastating disease.  Suave bad-guy Sean Ambrose steals the virus with the intent of infecting the world's population and selling the antidote to the pharmaceutical company that developed the virus.  The IMF team--headed by Cruise's Ethan Hunt and assisted by a beautiful jewel thief--must recover the antidote and stop Ambrose before he can carry out the deed.The action sequences don't disappoint and are definitely the product of Woo's involvement, including trademark slow-motion sequences framed by flames, smoke, etc.; doves flying through all-out warfare; impressive motorcycle stunts; and the obligatory shot of good guy vs. bad guy with guns pointed at each others' heads.  Where some may find the plot somewhat lacking and perhaps constructed to service said action sequences, the film is somewhat weaker than might have been hoped, but overall it doesn't disappoint like the first movie.  My chief complaint is the lack of involvement by the remaining IMF team members; the film seems almost totally devoted to showing Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton's good looks rather than performing the team-effort so intrisnic to episodes of the original television series.",4,Woo Delivers Superior Film to Original MI Movie,1047859200,"03 17, 2003",2003,1542,"['Many', 'fans', 'television', 'series', 'found', 'first', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'film', 'be', 'disappointing', 'adaptation', 'big', 'screen', 'addition', 'legendary', 'Honk', 'Kong', 'action', 'film', 'guru', 'John', 'Woo', 'still', 'seeking', 'true', 'breakthrough', 'US', 'hit', 'promised', 'better', 'sequel', 'original.The', 'plot', 'superbug', 'science', 'bit', 'unplausible', 'infects', 'red', 'blood', 'cells', 'devastating', 'disease', 'Suave', 'bad-guy', 'Sean', 'Ambrose', 'virus', 'intent', 'infecting', 'world', 'population', 'selling', 'antidote', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'developed', 'virus', 'IMF', 'team', 'headed', 'Cruise', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'assisted', 'beautiful', 'jewel', 'thief', 'must', 'recover', 'antidote', 'stop', 'Ambrose', 'can', 'carry', 'out', 'deed.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'are', 'definitely', 'product', 'Woo', 'involvement', 'including', 'trademark', 'slow-motion', 'sequences', 'framed', 'flames', 'smoke', 'etc', 'doves', 'flying', 'all-out', 'warfare', 'impressive', 'motorcycle', 'stunts', 'obligatory', 'shot', 'good', 'guy', 'vs.', 'bad', 'guy', 'guns', 'pointed', 'others', 'heads', 'Where', 'may', 'find', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'perhaps', 'constructed', 'service', 'said', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'somewhat', 'weaker', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'hoped', 'overall', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'first', 'movie', 'chief', 'complaint', 'lack', 'involvement', 'remaining', 'IMF', 'team', 'members', 'film', 'almost', 'totally', 'devoted', 'showing', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'good', 'looks', 'rather', 'performing', 'team-effort', 'so', 'intrisnic', 'episodes', 'original', 'television', 'series']",N/A

Not much, really.The concept of the Mission Impossible Force as a a TEAM of members, as in the original series and the first MI film, has given way to creating just another star vehicle for actor/producer Tom Cruise.  This movie exists SOLELY to present a buff Cruise as Mr. Action-Movie Hero, a territory he is relatively new to. As with many movies like this, plot and plausibility are secondary to whiz-bang effects and stunts.  A good script is the foundation that any good movie with staying-power is built upon.  Instead, MI2 is built AROUND something.  It is just an action showcase, that's all.  That this movie topped the box office in 2000 is testament only to the drawing power of Mr. Cruise and the public's diminishing discriminatory taste in intelligent script fare.  The popular media will have you believe that moviegoers' tastes are becoming more demanding and sophisticated, but you'd be hard-pressed to find evidence of that in this latest stunt-fest. But is the DVD worth renting?  Sure, for the DVD extras, behind the scenes technical goodies, and the MTV spoof.  But the movie lacks any elements to warrant ownership's repeat viewings.  Sure, the stunt setpieces are over-the-top and fun, but the minute a new movie can top it (and rest assured one will) MI2 will be just another discarded excess of its time.Lump this movie in the same category as the insulting INDEPENDENCE DAY --  all style, no substance.",3,Eye candy only!

522350,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,B00003CXDF,Josef Bush,"[1, 2]","At tis viewing I haven't watched the first Tom Cruise MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, but I probably will, later.  Whether or not the flick got bad reviews doesn't affect my reaction.  All I care about is what happens when I put it in the machine and sit down to watch.  For me, that's the first time, and the movie is New and Original.  And all I can say is, Tom Cruise is very, very good at what he does, and the world knows it.Woo's direction is excellent, with a good deal of that HongKong dazzle we've all come to love.  Fine by me.  When I watach escapist flicks I don't expect realism, and don't really want it.  But, I thik that what makes MI-2 as watchable as it is, is Cruise's persona; not his personality, but the clever use of his unusual and still unusually handsome face, coupled with his relatively small, wiry  body.  I think it was Salinger who said that actors were best served by havin small or relatively small bodies.  It lends their movement -- particularly acrobatic or athletic movement -- an extra sense of spacial excitement.  Big action actors like Schwartzenekker don't have that extra physical excitement, thogh they're as agile and move as well, simply because they're so big.  Size makes them look slower.  (Watch Donald O'Connor dance beside Gene Kelly.  Kelly's good but Donald's flying!)  In this film Cruise's stunts, like his high jumping or slithering down cables have an ariel circus kind of excitement.  Personally, the opening mountain-climbing sequence filmed out in the Arizona high sandstone formations, hooked me.  An acrophobic with a keen fear of heights, bare-handed climbing, alone, drives me wild, and when he slipped, or appeared to slip and fall maybe 20 or 30 feet down the face of the cliff, I let out a yell.As for the rest of it, trick driving and particularly trick motorcycle stunt driving; I bought it.  I love bike riding, thogh I never do any trick riding, and these sequences, like those in MATRIX RELOADED were thrilling.Leading Lady?  Thandie Newton (as ""the Girl"") did what she was supposed to do: she made Tom look great; ie., sexy and desireable.  But, Newton?  She was far more interesting and had more to do in RIDDIK, and made Karl Urban sexy by appearing to be attracted to him.  Action Heroes require particulr kinds of actresses, and more often than not they must be exotic in some way.  One remembers Rae Dawn Chong paired with Arnold, and of Grace Jones with Schwartzenekker, again, as Konan, and then playing beside Roger Moore's James Bond in VIEW TO A KILL.  The idea seems to be, the greater the contrast between them, the greater and more exciting will the attraction appear.  What happen to these actresses?  Diesel's uber-heisse Bohemian squeeze in XXX; what ever happened to her?Negative:  Waste of Ving Rhames.  Great face/head; great voice, but where was he?

522351,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B00003CXDF,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","""Mission Impossible 2"" is darker and moodier than the first film in the series (there are lots of slow-motion shots and slow-burn looks of longing between Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton), but it still has the clever, tense, and slam-bang elements needed for a good ""Mission Impossible"" film.  So, even if you don't like the moodiness and lush romance added to the mix, you should still enjoy the movie.Highlights include a great mountain-climbing sequence in the beginning, a couple of exciting car chases, some signature John Woo gunplay, and a chase at the climax involving motorcycles.  Also, Thandie Newton is very pretty and a pleasure to watch throughout, giving a relaxed, engaging performance.Alas, some quibbles:  every single time one of those peel-off masks was being used by a character to impersonate someone else, I predicted it.  They would telegraph an imminent dramatic-peel-off-the-mask moment by having the character we think we were seeing act plainly out of character for that person.  Also, Ethan Hunt's infiltration of the science lab via helicopter and cable winch was just a bigger version of the the first movie's famous CIA infiltration scene.  Finally, there's a slightly more conventional feel to the proceedings compared to Brian De Palma's edgy, unpredictable first MI adventure.But the quibbles are just that, quibbles.  Though I ultimately liked the first film more, there's certainly enough here to enjoy if you're in the mood for a clever, pedal-to-the-metal action thriller.

522352,A1T40HDUXPA7RM,B00003CXDF,Josh C.,"[7, 8]","Memorial Day weekend is traditionally when a huge summer blockbuster hits theaters and causes people to line up for hours just to watch stuff blow up. This year was no exception, as the eagerly anticipated Mission Impossible 2 opened to hordes of people wanting to see Tom Cruise dangling from a cliff and, of course, blowing a lot of stuff up.Before diving into this feature-packed DVD, be warned that M:I-2 is a very different movie than its predecessor. Where the previous movie was more of a mystery with a little action tossed in, M:I-2 is a straight up popcorn movie and fits the summer blockbuster profile nearly perfectly.Mission Impossible 2 is a strange sequel. It doesn't make any references to its 1996 hit predecessor, and the only returning characters are Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and Luther Sickell (Ving Rhames).The movie opens with a theft of a deadly genetically engineered disease known as Chimera by a group of terrorists lead by a former IMF agent turned bad (Dougrey Scott). Of course, the only person who can stop him is Ethan Hunt.Ethan teams up with again with Luther, and gets help from an international thief by the name of Nyah (Thandie Newton). Throughout the course of the mission, Nyah gets infected with the Chimera and Ethan must then get the cure, which is known as Ballerophon.If all of this sounds familiar, its because the story is just so cookie-cutter. We've all seen the good agent/bad agent thing before in Bond movies (Goldeneye anyone?), and the whole &quot;genetically engineered virus in the hands of terrorists&quot; angle has been played out in movies such as The Rock.Which brings up one of the biggest problems with the movie - the plot (or lack of one). Many people complained how the first Mission Impossible was &quot;too complicated&quot; and they didn't understand it. With M:I-2 they made a &quot;story&quot; that is so simple to understand that the dialog and plot insults anyone with half a brain.But despite the plot problems, there are some very cool action sequences and Ving Rhames is always awesome no matter what he is in. There is one scene late in the movie (track 14 on the disc for those who want to jump right to it) where Ethan Hunt escapes from the villain's HQ on a motorcycle that is simply one of the best action scenes in any movie this year.M:I-2 is one of those films where you just need to check your brain at the door and strap yourself in for tons of action.",4,Check Your Brain At The Door,992131200,"06 10, 2001",2001,2432,"['Memorial', 'Day', 'weekend', 'traditionally', 'when', 'huge', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'theaters', 'people', 'line', 'up', 'hours', 'just', 'watch', 'stuff', 'blow', 'up', 'year', 'was', 'exception', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'opened', 'hordes', 'people', 'wanting', 'see', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'dangling', 'cliff', 'course', 'blowing', 'lot', 'stuff', 'up.Before', 'diving', 'feature-packed', 'DVD', 'be', 'warned', 'M', 'I-2', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'predecessor', 'Where', 'previous', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'mystery', 'little', 'action', 'tossed', 'M', 'I-2', 'straight', 'up', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'profile', 'nearly', 'perfectly.Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'strange', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'make', 'references', '1996', 'hit', 'predecessor', 'only', 'returning', 'characters', 'are', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'Cruise', 'Luther', 'Sickell', 'Ving', 'Rhames', '.The', 'movie', 'theft', 'deadly', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'disease', 'known', 'Chimera', 'group', 'terrorists', 'lead', 'former', 'IMF', 'agent', 'turned', 'bad', 'Dougrey', 'Scott', 'course', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'stop', 'Ethan', 'Hunt.Ethan', 'up', 'again', 'Luther', 'help', 'international', 'thief', 'name', 'Nyah', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'course', 'mission', 'Nyah', 'infected', 'Chimera', 'Ethan', 'must', 'then', 'get', 'cure', 'known', 'Ballerophon.If', 'familiar', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'cookie-cutter', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'agent/bad', 'agent', 'thing', 'Bond', 'movies', 'Goldeneye', 'anyone', 'whole', 'quot', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'virus', 'hands', 'terrorists', 'quot', 'angle', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'movies', 'such', 'Rock.Which', 'up', 'one', 'biggest', 'problems', 'movie', 'plot', 'lack', 'one', 'Many', 'people', 'complained', 'how', 'first', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'was', 'quot', 'too', 'complicated', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'M', 'I-2', 'made', 'quot', 'story', 'quot', 'so', 'simple', 'understand', 'dialog', 'plot', 'insults', 'anyone', 'brain.But', 'plot', 'problems', 'are', 'very', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'always', 'awesome', 'matter', 'what', 'one', 'scene', 'late', 'movie', 'track', '14', 'disc', 'who', 'want', 'jump', 'right', 'where', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'villain', 'HQ', 'motorcycle', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'year.M', 'I-2', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'just', 'need', 'check', 'brain', 'door', 'strap', 'tons', 'action']",N/A

Well, as it turns out, Mission: Impossible 2 is an example of a film that stylishly surpasses it's original, and it was well worth the money I paid.IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of a genetically created disease called 'Chimera'. His mission is made impossible due to the fact that he is not the only person after samples of the disease. He must also contest with a gang of international terrorist headed by a turned bad former IMF agent who has already managed to steal the cure called 'Bellerophon' and now need 'Chimera' to complete their grand plan of infecting the whole world. In order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist group he relies on the help of an international thief Nyah (Thandie Newton) of whom he quickly develops a love interest. Time is not only running out for Agent Hunt to find and destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get their hands on it, but he must also find 'Bellerophon' so as to save his love interest who has already become infected by the disease from a terrible and rapid death.The story is a bit on-edge, but, hell, who cares? You'll be having so much fun that you won't even notice the small flaws! The cast all get really involved in Mission: Impossible 2, especially Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton who light up the screen as two hip, adventurous go-getter's slowly falling for each other. Anthony Hopkins and Ving Rhames also have a blast of a time, Hopkins in particular, who, in his 3-minute screen appearance, manages to steal most of the movie.

522357,A2LYCUB4DKNOHG,B00003CXDF,"Justin ""The Claw""","[2, 3]","One thing's for sure: this isn't Brian DePalma's Mission: Impossible.  This M:I was directed by John Woo, famous for Broken Arrow and Face/Off, which means lots of slow-mos, lots of fancy-pants flip-kicking, and lots of miraculous, one-handed gun shooting.  I'm not sure whether I like John Woo's style for M:I or not, but DePalma's was more realistic, more emotional, more interesting and in my opinion, better all around.  However, the fact that Woo's style does not fit Mission: Impossible does not make M:I2 a bad movie.All gripes aside, M:I2 is a good movie, especially for what looked like a mindless action flick compared to the first.  The plot is (disappointingly) simple: Tom Cruise reprises his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, who is tracking fellow IMF agent Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott.  Hunt is trying to recover a fatal genetically-engineered virus which kills whomever it infects within 20 hours.  Ambrose has stolen both the virus and its antidote for financial gain, 37,000,000 to be exact.  In order to find out Ambrose's plans, Hunt sends his ex-girlfriend, Nyah Hall (whom he has already fallen in love with...and slept with), played by Thandie Newton.  Personally, I think the romance between Ethan and Nyah was totally unneccessary.  It didn't add much to the plot and it seemed very generic.At first I didn't like the fact that you know who the bad guy is, until the infiltration scene, where Ethan must sneak into the building where the virus is being kept and detroy them.  I realized then why they did it.  You see, Ambrose had been Hunt's impersonator (this isn't a spoiler, we find this out early in the movie) and because he know Hunt's way of doing things, it creates a spy vs. spy scenerio where one is always one step ahead of the other one.  You never know who's going to come out ahead.What M:I2 lacks in sophistication and emotional substance, it makes up for with great action and suspense.  This comes as no surprise, because that is what John Woo is best known for.  The hand-to-hand(-to-flying-kick) fight scenes were really intense.  Just when it looks like Ethan's winning, his opponent manages to turn the tables on him, and vice versa.  This worked well especially in the final battle.Woo does overuse use his slow-mos.  There's at least one every five minutes.  It's almost as if the movie wasn't long enough so he decided to play it in slow-mo.  He does use them appropriately however, and they do create the effect he was going for, but they do get a little irritating after a while.  His use of colors is a little techno-ish.  They are always bright and vibrant no matter what's happening in the movie.  He does occationally separate colors to set moods, like blue lights for suspense and things like that, but for the most part the movie is very colorful, certainly a contrast from DePalma's infiltration scene, where everything was black and white for a neutral effect.The music, by Hans Zimmer, was a bit excessive.  Also, I didn't like the techno-metal score alone, but again, it worked very well for Woo's style.  I prefer Danny Elfman's more soothing, emotional, percussion-driven score from the first movie; but I will admit, I am a bit biased since Danny Elfman is my favorite composer.And I can't write this review with out mentioning the chase scenes, which were some of the most exciting I've ever seen outside of a James Bond film.  The scene in the beginning where Ethan and Nyah are playing cat-and-dog in their high-class sports cars was intense, especially since they were on on windy cliff-side road and there were actually civilian cars for them to avoid.  The motorcycle chase at the end wasn't as original as the train scene in the first M:I, but it was easily just as exciting.All in all, this is a great movie.  It has a great plot, great action scenes, and enough surprises to keep on your toes.  I missed the intricate plot twists like in the first M:I, and I didn't exactly walk away from the movie in awe, but it held my interest and kept me on the edge of my seat.  Some of the lines were kind of corny, especially Ambrose's, who is basically your run-of-the-mill bad guy, only with some foresight; and as I mentioned before, the romance between Hunt and Hall was useless and hardly integral to the plot, the movie would have worked fine if their relationship remained professional.  These things aside Mission: Impossible II stands alone as a fun and exciting film which doesn't disappoint...as long as you don't try comparing it to the first.  I only wish Anthony Hopkins had had a bigger part in the film.P.S. There are a lot of great bonuses on this DVD, along with the typical trailers and music videos, there are also many ""making of"" videos, including in-depth documentaries on every major stunt (99% of which Cruise did himself...the movie is worth watching just to see the actor do all his stunts, including the scary knife-to-eye scene).  Also, as has already been mentioned before, there is the very funny Mission: Improbable from the MTV Movie Awards.  (Ben Stiller loves making fun of Tom Cruise, I guess.  He did a parody of the first M:I at another MTV Movie Awards)In closing, I recommend this DVD.  It's fun to watch, and though lacking in substance, excels in action and enjoyment.",3,Comparing the first to the second is Mission: Impossible,991180800,"05 30, 2001",2001,5282,"['One', 'thing',

If you like good acting, an engaging plot, and interesting characters, this movie is NOT for you.Obviously, this movie was meant as a money-making blockbuster, without much thought of art involved.  The best I can say about this movie is that it had great cinematography.  But other than that, the idea was simple--throw together an edgy, electronic score by Metallica and Limp Bizkit, a lot of gravity-defying action, Tom Cruise, and an anorexic love interest meant as eye candy, and WHAM!--You've got yourself an assured summer blockbuster.  Everyone goes home rich and happy--even though Tom Cruise is undoubtedly rich enough, and this movie turned him from a once-respectable actor to a definite sell-out.And the sad thing is that I know Tom Cruise can act.  I saw him give an excellent performance as the anti-hero Lestat in &quot;Interview with the Vampire.&quot;  In my opinion, that was his best performance ever.  Anyone who reads Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles knows that Cruise captured Lestat perfectly.But Cruise undoubtedly made so much money off MI2 that they'd have to pay him, like, a billion dollars to star as another character like Lestat.FYI: Thandie Newton, Cruise's love interest in MI2, played the servant girl Yvette in &quot;Interview with the Vampire.&quot;Anyway, the movie is okay--a definite guy movie with a lot of action, but don't expect anything else.

522360,ABQPBY4VNK40Y,B00003CXDF,Karl Flaig,"[5, 8]","John Woo, the fanboy revered action director with a touch so subtle and vision so pure one could only take him to be the second coming of Renny Harlin, helmed this horrendous follow-up to Brian DePalma's often maligned, though simplistic, original Mission:Impossible.  Back again is Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, but he's no longer playing a super-spy.  No, he's now a gun-crazed, martial-arts skilled one-man army with bad hygiene and the incredible ability to jump off moving motorcycles while suffering nary a scratch. Of course one Hunt factor does continue, he picks some bad girlfriends.So with Woo directing, what do we get?  Possibly one of the worst films of all time.  Woo does his usual, packing on the two-fisted, guns blazing slo-motion &quot;ballet&quot;.  Of course if we put the whole film at regular speed, this turkey would barely clock in at over 30 minutes.  So Hunt's got guns ripping up everything in sight, Thandie Newton is along to play the lover interest and there's a barely there plot about some nasty little virus. Personally, I'd like to get my hands on the virus from the movie and take a healthy dose before witnessing this thing again.Oh, by the way, it's got doves too.  A must for Woo.  We know how peaceful he really is.  And how he's trying to make a deep statement.  At least Woo didn't have Cruise running his hand all over characters' faces this time ala Face/Off.  I guess we can him credit for some growth.  Maybe in 10 or 20 films Woo will actually make a decent movie.

I think the first thing that we notice is that this is not about the Impossible Mission Force, but Tom Cruise.  So, aside form the name, the music, and the jargon, this has nothing to do with the classic show.This was a let-down.  Leonard Nemoy in ""I Am Spock"" mentioned that he loved the teamwork aspect of the series.  I agree: there was something about Mr. Phelps and the IMF all piling into the getaway van and the classic Mission: Impossible recessional theme that let you know that there was a job well done because each member did his part.  Like the guy said, ""The greatest temporal and spiritual blessings which always come from faithfulness and concerted effort, never attended individual exertion or enterprise.""Another problem was the physics.  The cycle-jousting forgets that when two objects traveling at 50 mph a piece collide, the cumulative force felt by them is not 50, but 100 mph.  Talk about being jelly!  And the gun in the sand: how does kicking it forward make it go one and half meters vertically into the air?This film has plot, in the sense of having action, or a series of events.  But did I mention the plot holes?  How did Cruise happen to have a Richard Roxburgh mask so handy? I guess it was next to the handy duct tape.  And how did they change clothes so quickly?Yes, there is conflict: Cruise versus the Aussie, and Cruise versus the supermodel supertheif. The theme is not so obvious. There are messages about courage, duty, and self sacrifice. These are helpful, but seem to be mere distracting tinsel.Being John Woo, this film is essentially about style. This is good for artists who have plot, theme, and characterization, and would like to perfect their craft.  As a standalone attribute, however, this film leaves something to be desired. Anyone who has been on a date knows that looks only go so far.

522362,A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM,B00003CXDF,Kenneth V. Cockrel,"[0, 0]","Call me crazy but I'm one of the few people who actually liked the first Mission: Impossible film.True, it was criticized by both audiences and critics for its supposedly confusing plot but the way I see it, good spy thrillers keep the audience guessing instead of revealing everything in the first 10 minutes.  But if MI1 suffered from too much plot, the opposite problem exists with MI2.What little storyline there is here is utilized solely to propel Tom Cruise from one elaborately staged action sequence to another.  To director John Woo's credit, some of these scenes are breathtaking.  My favorite is the car chase between Cruise and Thandie Newton's jewel thief/love interest. This isn't a high octane chase as much as it is a tango dance with souped-up automobiles.One can understand why Cruise wanted to make this &quot;Mission&quot; a little more audience-friendly and Woo was clearly happy to oblige.  But one of the film's biggest failings actually lies with those same action sequences.  Some of the fight scenes are so over the top they can't be believed.Call it post-&quot;Matrix&quot; fallout if you will but I'm a little tired of elaborately-choreographed fight scenes where the heroes perform feats of strength and acrobaticism that are impossible for anyone who isn't from planet Krypton.You can accept that Keanu Reeves' Neo is able to leap horizontally 50 feet through the air while also firing his automatic. This is because a film like &quot;The Matrix&quot; establishes early on that most of its action takes place in a virtual world where normal laws of physics do not apply.  You CANNOT accept that Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt can leap 10 feet vertically from a motorcycle moving at nearly 100 miles per hour and collide with the villain without sustaining injury because MI2 clearly is supposed to take place in the real world.  In the real world, you try that, you die.  Pure and simple.As for Woo, it's time to concede that Hollywood has spoiled him.  As enjoyable as this film or say &quot;Face/Off&quot; may be on a surface level, stack those films up to his Hong Kong movies like &quot;The Killer&quot; or &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; and they don't even come close.MI2 is ultimately like most of Woo's Hollywood output, slick and fast-moving but devoid of complexity and emotional depth.As for the DVD, on a purely technical level it looks and sounds great.  It's also loaded with enough extras that fans of the film will probably consider it a must have.  Most notable, is the hilarious sketch comedy sequence from last year's MTV Movie Awards and featuring Ben Stiller.The huge box office this film earned pretty much guarantees there will be an MI3.

522363,AHRSDAKFHXEUX,B00003CXDF,kentuckyreader,"[3, 4]","I was surprised to discover that this is a refashioning of Hitchcock's 1946 classic &quot;Notorious.&quot;  While Cruise and Newton are no Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, they don't try to be.  Refreshingly, the film only borrows the shell of the story, without trying to be some kind of remake.Thandie Newton is, in particular, a pleasure in this film.  Not only does she have truckloads of screen presence, is strikingly beautiful (I can't stop watching her when she's onscreen), and can actually act, she has been given an actual flesh and blood, thinking, real character to portray ... not just &quot;the woman.&quot;I was disappointed in one scene, though, where she - an obviously skilled pickpocket - makes the grevious error of replacing an item into the wrong pocket from which she'd originally picked it, which reveals herself to the villain.However, later, she regains this ground when she injects herself with the virus, turning herself from a somewhat disposable character into suddenly the most valuable person in the room.But what I like most about this film is something I like about other Woo films I've seen (Face/Off).

He's a little to James Bond like at times, but you'll learn to look past that. His action sequences in the film are amazing. Tom Crusie did all his stunts in the film. Let me say again that Cruise did all his stunts in the movie. From the rock climbing to the bike riding they are amazing. I think it's great that a star with his kind of power will do it. He loves doing it to, and it really adds to the movie.John Woo really does some great action in the picture. The chases and fight scenes are awesome. Everybody that sees this film will see something they've never seen before and that makes it fun. I loved the whole bird thing and was waiting to see the white dove which is one of his call signs. Woo does a good job of directing with what he's given to work with.The DVD extras are pretty good. You have a 15 minute special behind the making of the movie, and there's another five minute one about the stunts. Throw in a Metalica music video and you have above average extras.I did enjoy this movie. I bought it and I wasn't to upset. The movie was a little to Jame Bond for me and the story was weak. Despite that the action makes it a four star film. If you loved the first one, you have to check this one out. If you love Tom Cruise this is another must. If you like Woo the same applies. If you want a good action flick then definetly pick it up. I did and I have no regrets.",4,The highs outnumber the lows in this decent sequel,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,2472,"['ca', ""n't"", 'knock', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'John', 'Woo', 'what', 'matter', 'film', 'can', 'take', 'little', 'blame', 'most', 'go', 'writers', 'story', 'little', 'overplayed', 'movie', 'much', 'Bond', 'feel', 'times', 'action', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'Cruise', 'man.Ethan', 'Hunt', 'Cruise', 'vacation', 'when', 'cut', 'short', 'must', 'recruit', 'sexy', 'thief', 'Nyah', 'Newton', 'help', 'next', 'case', 'dangerous', 'virus', 'Chimera', 'been', 'stolen', 'IMF', 'employee', 'Sean', 'Ambrosse', 'Scott', 'selling', 'virus', 'highest', 'bidder', 'Now', 'Hunt', 'Sean', 'ex-love', 'Nyah', 'must', 'stop', 'lost.The', 'plot', 'worn', 'been', 'used', 'way', 'much', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'whole', 'movie', 'where', 'writing', 'team', 'be', 'put', 'blame', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'what', 'film', 'star', 'director.Tom', 'Cruise', 'man', 'produced', 'movie', 'production', 'partner', 'Paula', 'Wagner', 'first', 'MI', 'film', 'acting', 'good', 'what', 'given', 'work', 'little', 'James', 'Bond', 'times', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'look', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'are', 'amazing', 'Tom', 'Crusie', 'did', 'stunts', 'film', 'Let', 'say', 'again', 'Cruise', 'did', 'stunts', 'movie', 'rock', 'climbing', 'bike', 'riding', 'are', 'amazing', 'think', 'great', 'star', 'kind', 'power', 'will', 'do', 'doing', 'really', 'movie.John', 'Woo', 'really', 'great', 'action', 'picture', 'chases', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'awesome', 'Everybody', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'fun', 'loved', 'whole', 'bird', 'thing', 'was', 'waiting', 'see', 'white', 'dove', 'one', 'call', 'signs', 'Woo', 'good', 'job', 'directing', 'what', 'given', 'work', 'with.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'have', '15', 'minute', 'special', 'making', 'movie', 'five', 'minute', 'one', 'stunts', 'Throw', 'Metalica', 'music', 'video', 'have', 'above', 'average', 'extras.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'bought', 'was', ""n't"", 'upset', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'Jame', 'Bond', 'story', 'was', 'weak', 'action', 'four', 'star', 'film', 'loved', 'first', 'one', 'have', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'love', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'must', 'like', 'same', 'applies', 'want', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'then', 'definetly', 'pick', 'up', 'did', 'have', 'regrets']",N/A

After you see, you might decided, as I did, that it really isn't that good of a movie, mainly because the plot isn't all that interesting. There are a lot of neat things in the film which almost but not quite overcome the weak story.Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, spy extraordinaire for a shadowy international organization. A rock climbing vacation is cut short when his boss, Swanbeck [Anthony Hopkins] summons him. A renegade ex-agent, Sean Ambrose [Dougray Scott] has kidnapped a doctor off a commercial flight from Australia to Atlanta and in the process has caused the plane to crash. It takes awhile for Hunt to figure out what the doctor had that was so valuable. When he does, he finds that millions of lives may be at risk. At Swanbeck's insistence, Hunt recruits a beautiful thief named Nyah {Thandie Newton] to help him. It is not until after they have fallen for each other that Hunt learns the true reason Swanbeck wanted her. She is Ambose's ex-girlfriend. Swanbeck intends to use her to infiltrate Ambrose's house. This is a situation that Hunt is not at all happy with.Cruise plays Hunt differently than he did in the first Mission: Impossible. He is cocky and sure of himself this time, and I think this works better. He is required at times to get into situations no mere mortal would live through, but consider the title. His scenes with Newton sizzle. You can almost feel the chemistry. Ms. Newton gives her role her best shot. She is required to go from independent and spirited to being your basic damsel in distress. Dougray Scott is quite convincing as the nefarious Ambrose. Anthony Hopkins has only two scenes as Swanbeck, but, as usual, he makes the most of them.Director John Woo should be credited for giving Mission: Impossible 2 a look and feel it probably doesn't deserve. Such visual beauty is most often reserved for more thoughtful fare. The shots of Hunt climbing a rock face in the desert are awesome. The movie's many explosions are well executed. The shootouts are highly stylized and have the look of a well choreographed dance. If the story had been as ingenious as the photography, this would have been a classic.",3,High tech sequel is rather disappointing,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2209,"['Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'sleek', 'sexy', 'stylish', 'see', 'might', 'decided', 'did', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'movie', 'mainly', 'plot', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'are', 'lot', 'neat', 'things', 'film', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'overcome', 'weak', 'story.Tom', 'Cruise', 'back', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'spy', 'extraordinaire', 'shadowy', 'international', 'organization', 'rock', 'climbing', 'vacation', 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'boss', 'Swanbeck', '[', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', ']', 'summons', 'renegade', 'ex-agent', 'Sean', 'Ambrose', '[', 'Dougray', 'Scott', ']', 'kidnapped', 'doctor', 'commercial', 'flight', 'Australia', 'Atlanta', 'process', 'caused', 'plane', 'crash', 'awhile', 'Hunt', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'doctor', 'had', 'was', 'so', 'valuable', 'When', 'millions', 'lives', 'may', 'be', 'risk', 'Swanbeck', 'insistence', 'Hunt', 'beautiful', 'thief', 'named', 'Nyah', 'Thandie', 'Newton', ']', 'help', 'not', 'have', 'fallen', 'other', 'Hunt', 'true', 'reason', 'Swanbeck', 'wanted', 'Ambose', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Swanbeck', 'use', 'infiltrate', 'Ambrose', 'house', 'situation', 'Hunt', 'not', 'happy', 'with.Cruise', 'plays', 'Hunt', 'differently', 'did', 'first', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'cocky', 'sure', 'time', 'think', 'better', 'required', 'times', 'get', 'situations', 'mere', 'mortal', 'would', 'live', 'consider', 'title', 'scenes', 'Newton', 'sizzle', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'Ms.', 'Newton', 'role', 'best', 'shot', 'required', 'go', 'independent', 'spirited', 'being', 'basic', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'quite', 'convincing', 'nefarious', 'Ambrose', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'only', 'two', 'scenes', 'Swanbeck', 'usual', 'most', 'them.Director', 'John', 'Woo', 'should', 'be', 'credited', 'giving', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'look', 'feel', 'probably', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Such', 'visual', 'beauty', 'most', 'often', 'reserved', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'fare', 'shots', 'Hunt', 'climbing', 'rock', 'face', 'desert', 'are', 'awesome', 'movie', 'many', 'explosions', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'shootouts', 'are', 'highly', 'stylized', 'have', 'look', 'well', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'as', 'ingenious', 'photography', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'classic']",N/A

I have no comment on that because I haven't watched MI1.Here are what I have for MI21)Good music and great CGI special effect.  Although some scenes are unbelieveable(eg. opening climb), it's flawless to me unless I slow-motion every second.2)Tom is a one-man-army, he's more a James Bond than working as a team.  I heard MI1 is about team work.3)Tom is great looking in that leather jacket.  I'm not a chick but I say he's so cool that I want that jacket.4)Overdone on mask tricks.  You can put a mask on to pretend someone but body built and voices can be hard to copy.5)Wild flying kicks.  You see Tom does this jump kicks all the time(more than 4 at last scene, I lost count), the problem for Tom is that he's a natural stiff.  He ain't Jet Li or someone who can do at ease.  He barely touches the bad guy.6)His romance with the girl is thin to me.  I think that's John Woo's style.  He is good making movies with excitment.Overall, this movie isn't too bad.

This is a good thrill ride and all but i've seen the plot too many times.  I don't get how anyone wouldn't understand it.  Some Einstein look-alike makes this virus and this antidote to cure it and is trying to make some bucks with Demeetree (Tom Cruise- Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut, Top Gun).  But he is tricked by Sean Ambrose, another agent, and Ambrose steals the virus and tries to make 30 million pounds.  So Ethan Hunt, (Cruise), goes out to stop him in high speed, ulitmate shootout form.  VERY DIFFERENT from the first Mission Impossible- it's not as confusing and there's a lot more action in the movie...  The plot which is old news like in such film's as Wolfgang Petersen's OUTBREAK and Steven Seagal's THE PATRIOT is about some virus that can kill you within 20 hours and has slipped into the wrong hands- Boring- if only it would have been different in that aspect of plotting it would have nearly been perfect.  The acting was great- but i woulda liked to have seen some in place of Ambrose's girlfriend- or Hunt's girlfriend-(Either way) should have been someone talented like Nicole Kidman or Patricia Valasquez, maybe even Jennifer Lopez or Carrie Anne Moss (Trinity- The Matrix).  The directing you could tell was far more different, from Brian DePalma (Mission To Mars) to John Woo (Face/Off, Broken Arrow).  Woo for this film used this slow motion a lot which for a few scenes was just too long like when the two (Hunt + Girl) were spinning in there cars over that cliff-like road.  That kinda stunk.  The masks- how would hunt know to bring all of those and everything- like at the near end when he was in that cave place underground and was facing Ambrose's ally- it really caught me in the theater when I found out that really wasn't Ethan Hunt that died.  Well, anyway this movie is pretty good so you should see it if you're an action fan and like seeing a typical plot repeated.

The scene was when he switched their faces, and I thought Roxburgh's character had beaten the crap out of Cruise's character and they killed him and I was feeling quite happy for the moment, until, they pulled the face off of Cruise and it was Roxburgh instead. I was DREADFULLY upset. And then it showed Roxburgh running, but it was really Cruise since he hadn't pulled off his face yet.

I found it boring &amp; predictable. And the don't take at face value is absolutely necessary. You don't know who people are going to be, as the mask of people's faces which was touched upon in the first movie, is now severely overdone in this, and now has a little sticker across the voice box, to make the voices the same too.Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt, and along with Ving Rhames, are the only two surviving members of the previous film. Along come a whole host of other characters, including Thandie Newton, and Dougray Scott - a sterotyped Scottish character, playing the bad guy as usual.This movie seems to steal a lot from a hyped film, which has influenced a lot of other movies - The Matrix. This film has a lot to answer to these days in the movie world, and I was disappointed to see Tom Cruise/John Woo steal certain bits to make their film better - and I'm sorry to say they failed.There are a lot of fight scenes in this, but they're not sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat fight scenes. They're overdone, and don't really have any effect on you.I was also disappointed by Tom Cruise in this. I much preferred his hair in the first film - the buzz cut - than his overlong, and unkempt look in this film. A year or so after this, Tom famously divorced Nicole Kidman, in favour of Penelope Cruz. I wouldn't be surprised if Nicole was jealous after seeing this film, as Tom &amp; Thandie (Newton) have a lot of chemistry, very unusual in co-stars. The fact that she also wears lots of low cut tops with push up bras probably helped.I loved the scenes featuring Tom &amp; Thandie, or just Thandie alone, cos the music in the background was really nice and peaceful. The Mission Impossible score is used quite a lot, but it sounded different to the original, and is overused and overloud at some points.Overall, I'm not disappointed I bought this film (it was on sale). And of course its a sequel, so I wasn't really expecting much. But I hope Tom Cruise doesn't think he's going to be onto a good thing if he churns out another one.

It was fast paced, tight and featured some nice teamwork from their incredible cast.  In bringing this series to the big screen, director John Woo has demonstrated his command of action scenes.  No one does car wrecks like Woo!  Unfortunately, both movies have really been vehicles for Tom Cruise to do his thing, and the essence of teamwork is relegated to supporting players, this time John Polson and Ving Rhames.  How an audience is expected to believe Cruise's instant love for the lovely Thandie Newton is beyond me, but it's a movie contrivance.  As is all of this film.  Granted, it's fast-paced, dynamic camera work and Dougray Scott is a fine villain.  But it's empty, vague, and oftentimes confusing.  The use of masks is overdone and somewhat predictable.  But, who can deny the visceral appeal of this movie?  Anthony Hopkins' uncredited appearance makes for a nice addition, too.If they do an MI-3, how about giving Cruise a good team:  add Vin Diesel, Angelina Jolie, Hugh Jackman and Jack Black?

However, this one is not on par with that movie by any stretch of the imagination.  I actually thought of giving this movie 1 star, but some of the action and visual effects were stunning, so that boosted my score.The film starts out brilliantly, and the mountain scene was breathtaking.  It all goes downhill from there...  I really think John Woo is off his rocker.  In the commentary in one of the special features on the DVD, he says he wanted to direct a love story.  Good try buddy!  And the action scenes were overdone and unrealistic.  I am impressed that Cruise did most of his stunts, but some of the stuff was just stupid, like the cartwheel kick at the end.  Can you actually tell me that someone would not be able to get out of the way?  They should have just stuck with a realistic fight scene, where the blows would actually hurt in real life.  This was further worsened by the slo-mo that was used constantly.  At least at regular speed it may have looked somewhat believable.Despite the problems I had with some of the action scenes, the worst part of the movie had to do with all the masks that were used.  I mean, how believable is it that Cruise kept a mask of his face, as well as a mask of each of the bad guys?  Added to that, who would believe that it was the same guy?  Remember, Cruise is short...at least three inches shorter than Dougray Scott.  Anybody would've been able to pick up on this...I am just so frustrated because they really wasted what could have been a good sequel.  Do yourself a favor and buy Mission:Impossible.

522395,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00003CXDF,Michael J. Mazza,"[0, 0]","Let's start out with the good points about &quot;Mission: Impossible--2.&quot; First, the action scenes are superb: director John Woo has created a stunning visual symphony of color and energy. It's high-tech violence infused with the beauty of poetry. Second, the special effects are flawless. And third, Tom Cruise's hair and physique look great.Beyond those good points, I found &quot;M:I-2&quot; to be one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2000. This is a beautiful but hollow shell of a movie; the film's visual power does not make up for the moral and emotional void at the film's core.The biggest problems involve Ethan Hunt, the character played by Cruise. Hunt's romance with the film's female lead (competently played by the exquisite Thandie Newton) is utterly unbelievable; the script gives no indication why these two should become so passionately devoted to each other. Is it just hormones? And Hunt's motivation with regard to the film's mission is similarly missing. Why is he so dedicated to his task and his organization? Does the Impossible Missions Force have a great benefits package, or what? The film's failure to go beyond the characters' surface actions left me feeling cheated.The story (involving terrorists, a biological weapon, and a love triangle) is competently written, but I've seen the &quot;James Bond&quot; producers do it better before. And the rest of Hunt's team is pretty much wasted; &quot;M:I-2&quot; is an unrepentant star vehicle for Tom Cruise (as if the film's poster didn't give this away). By eviscerating the &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; teamwork element, the film's producers do a disservice to the memory of the original television series.",3,"Visually stunning, but emotionally hollow",973728000,"11 9, 2000",2000,1703,"['Let', 'start', 'good', 'points', 'quot', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2.', 'quot', 'First', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'superb', 'director', 'John', 'Woo', 'created', 'stunning', 'visual', 'symphony', 'color', 'energy', 'high-tech', 'violence', 'infused', 'beauty', 'poetry', 'Second', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'flawless', 'third', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'hair', 'physique', 'look', 'great.Beyond', 'good', 'points', 'found', 'quot', 'M', 'I-2', 'quot', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'cinematic', 'disappointments', '2000', 'beautiful', 'hollow', 'shell', 'movie', 'film', 'visual', 'power', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'moral', 'emotional', 'void', 'film', 'core.The', 'biggest', 'problems', 'involve', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'character', 'played', 'Cruise', 'Hunt', 'romance', 'film', 'female', 'lead', 'competently', 'played', 'exquisite', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'utterly', 'unbelievable', 'script', 'indication', 'why', 'two', 'should', 'become', 'so', 'passionately', 'devoted', 'other', 'just', 'hormones', 'Hunt', 'motivation', 'regard', 'film', 'mission', 'similarly', 'missing', 'Why', 'so', 'dedicated', 'task', 'organization', 'Impossible', 'Missions', 'Force', 'have', 'great', 'benefits', 'package', 'what', 'film', 'failure', 'go', 'characters', 'surface', 'actions', 'left', 'feeling', 'cheated.The', 'story', 'involving', 'terrorists', 'biological', 'weapon', 'love', 'triangle', 'competently', 'written', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quot', 'James', 'Bond', 'quot', 'producers', 'do', 'better', 'rest', 'Hunt', 'team', 'pretty', 'much', 'wasted', 'quot', 'M', 'I-2', 'quot', 'unrepentant', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'film', 'poster', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'eviscerating', 'quot', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'quot', 'element', 'film', 'producers', 'do', 'disservice', 'memory', 'original', 'television', 'series']",N/A
522396,A2JU4FUSW1PBEC,B00003CXDF,Michael Pappalardo,"[2, 3]","The inferior sequel rears its ugly head yet again.  Classic John Woo action is the only thing that makes this movie.  Other than that, there is nothing else that you will find remarkable.First of all, the surprises, twists and turns and shocks of the first movie are just completely left out in this movie.  You never would have expected some of the events in the first one to happen, but they did.  In this film, you see everything coming a mile away.  The very few scenes that are intended to be shocking or surprising are too blatantly obvious to deliver the effect.The plot suffers from misdirection and boredom.  With a cheesy love sub-plot thrown into a story about a killer virus that a former IMF agent is eager to get his hands on, there isn't much you'll find enjoyable or engrossing.  Missing the suspense of the original, you won't need to think or try to put two and two together.  And once again, a renegade IMF agent is the villain.  What is it with these guys?  Do they go evil after they have one too many missions?  Everything is pretty much right there on a platter.The action is classic John Woo, but becomes way too unbeleivable to be appreciated.  Ethan Hunt has accuracy with his gun that would make the Terminator jealous, and pulls off stunts that are just a bit too over-the-top for my tastes.  I also didn't know that they make guns with unlimited ammo nowadays.  Throughout the whole movie, you will see Ethan Hunt reload his gun no more than one time.  The motorcycle and driving stunts are done fairly well, but again, become too unbeleivable to be appreciated.  Last time I checked, Ethan Hunt was an IMF agent, not Neo from the Matrix.Overall, if you want some mindless action and crazy stunts, then you might enjoy this movie.  However, if you enjoyed the first movie, you will probably find that this sequel is going to fall short of expectations.  The film moves slowly, and the end fight drags on way too much, at which point you will be asking yourself 'when is it gonna end?'

In one scene, Cruise searches for Thandie NEwton while the camera keeps cutting between him looking and a dancer downstairs in a village.  This was probably one movie that was only sold on pretty-boy Cruise than anything else.

It's worth the price of admission for the trademark John Woo flourishes (doves, flapping capes, hyperkinetic action, etc.) alone, not to mention the stunning action sequences.Tom Cruise returns as superspy Ethan Hunt, whose rock-climbing vacation (an eye-popping set piece if ever there was one) is rudely interrupted by his new unnamed boss (played nicely by Anthony Hopkins).Hunt's mission is to stop a renegade former IM spy Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from selling a lethal virus on the black market. To get to Ambrose, Hopkins tells Hunt to find the renegade spy's ex-girlfriend, Nyah (played by a radiant Thandie Newton). Of course, Hunt and Nyah fall for each other but not before they try to run each other off a winding mountain road (it's a John Woo flick, folks...deal with it). And of course, Ambrose infects Nyah with the virus, making Hunt's mission two-fold: to save the world AND Nyah.Unlike the original &quot;MI,&quot; which featured so many strange plot twists that it was often difficult to follow, the plot of &quot;MI:2&quot; is so transparent that you can see what'll happen about a half hour before it actually happens.But the point of this film is not plot or characters, though it gamely tries to beef up both; this film is about action. And &quot;MI:2&quot; delivers in droves on this count, with about a half-dozen of the best action set pieces you'll ever see.The only set piece that doesn't succeed grandly is one in which Hunt is dropped into a biotech company's heavily defended high-rise laboratory. The scene works, but it tries too hard to one-up the now-classic scene from the first &quot;MI&quot; film in which Hunt is suspended over a CIA computer.The principal actors all turn in solid action-style performances (especially Cruise and Newton, whose chemistry is tangible), and the requisite summer-movie lines (&quot;That's why it's 'Mission Impossible,' Mr. Hunt,&quot; Hopkins tells Hunt) are all present and accounted for.Overall, if you put your brain on autopilot for a couple of hours, &quot;MI:2&quot; will reward you with a superior action experience.",4,Put your brain on autopilot and prepare to be amazed...,975974400,"12 5, 2000",2000,2318,"['Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'right', 'away', 'quot', 'MI:2', 'quot', 'NOT', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane.', 'quot', 'fact', ""n't"", 'even', 'quot', 'Die', 'Hard.', 'quot', 'one', 'heck', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'price', 'admission', 'trademark', 'John', 'Woo', 'flourishes', 'doves', 'flapping', 'capes', 'hyperkinetic', 'action', 'etc', 'alone', 'not', 'mention', 'stunning', 'action', 'sequences.Tom', 'Cruise', 'superspy', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'rock-climbing', 'vacation', 'eye-popping', 'set', 'piece', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'rudely', 'interrupted', 'new', 'unnamed', 'boss', 'played', 'nicely', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', '.Hunt', 'mission', 'stop', 'renegade', 'former', 'IM', 'spy', 'Sean', 'Ambrose', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'selling', 'lethal', 'virus', 'black', 'market', 'get', 'Ambrose', 'Hopkins', 'Hunt', 'find', 'renegade', 'spy', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Nyah', 'played', 'radiant', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'course', 'Hunt', 'Nyah', 'fall', 'other', 'not', 'try', 'run', 'other', 'off', 'winding', 'mountain', 'road', 'John', 'Woo', 'flick', 'folks', 'deal', 'course', 'Ambrose', 'Nyah', 'virus', 'making', 'Hunt', 'mission', 'two-fold', 'save', 'world', 'Nyah.Unlike', 'original', 'quot', 'MI', 'quot', 'featured', 'so', 'many', 'strange', 'plot', 'twists', 'was', 'often', 'difficult', 'follow', 'plot', 'quot', 'MI:2', 'quot', 'so', 'transparent', 'can', 'see', 'what', ""'ll"", 'happen', 'half', 'hour', 'actually', 'happens.But', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'plot', 'characters', 'gamely', 'beef', 'up', 'film', 'action', 'quot', 'MI:2', 'quot', 'delivers', 'droves', 'count', 'half-dozen', 'best', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see.The', 'only', 'set', 'piece', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'grandly', 'one', 'Hunt', 'dropped', 'biotech', 'company', 'heavily', 'defended', 'high-rise', 'laboratory', 'scene', 'too', 'hard', 'one-up', 'now-classic', 'scene', 'first', 'quot', 'MI', 'quot', 'film', 'Hunt', 'suspended', 'CIA', 'computer.The', 'principal', 'actors', 'turn', 'solid', 'action-style', 'performances', 'especially', 'Cruise', 'Newton', 'chemistry', 'tangible', 'requisite', 'summer-movie', 'lines', 'quot', 'why', ""'Mission"", 'Impossible', 'Mr.', 'Hunt', 'quot', 'Hopkins', 'Hunt', 'are', 'present', 'accounted', 'for.Overall', 'put', 'brain', 'autopilot', 'couple', 'hours', 'quot', 'MI:2', 'quot', 'will', 'reward', 'superior', 'action', 'experience']",N/A

Well, the bright folks in Hollywood decided to torture us again, with an equally poor effort.  Like the first one, the first hour has absolutely nothing going on, except for a lot of hi-tech mumbo-jumbo and cloudy character development.  You have to put up with a lot of pointless developments, bad acting and a plodding script to get to the action. By the time the far-fetched final motorcycle chase comes along - which seems to last for aeons - you're too bored to care about the exciting and innovative stunts.  The stunts certainly are impressive, and there are a lot of things that go 'boom', so fans of stupid movies may be satisfied.  But stunts and exploding rubble make not a good movie.  The humourous cliche-fest of a script ('the clock is ticking') and terrible acting are tolerable in a movie of this nature, but there are too many other things wrong with this movie.  The Thandie Newton character is dull, cardboardy, and doesn't have much to do other than look pretty or violent, and the same can be said for Tom Cruise, and basically everyone else.  In fact, only the Anthony Hopkins character (who gets about 2 minutes of screen time) is remotely likeable.  In short, you find yourself not rooting for anyone, because you don't care about anyone.  Also, the plot can be compared directly to swiss cheese - as in, it's full of holes.  And the incredibly boring first two thirds of the movie are just dreadful.  The thin plot progresses in a lethargic and confusing manner.  The deadly virus theme - which has been used a million times before - is a pretty lame excuse for flying motorcycles and exploding things.  And really, the exploding things aren't all that exciting after the five-billionth movie.

To see the brilliance of John Woo, check out Boiling Point and the Killer, two great movies with another great actor Chow Yun-Fat.  And most of the action from MI2 was from other Woo movies.

Lets examine this one.  The premise is simple; a group of rogue intelligence agents steal a biological agent and want to use it to make money.  In the process of executing their plan, they run up against Ethan Hunt and his ensemble cast of agents.  As the two sides fight of against each other, we see cool gadgets being used, surreal gunfights that result in minimal bloodshed, knockout fistfights that leave no bruises and affects no hairlines, and of course the gorgeous babe that used to the bad guy's girl but who switches allegiance to the good guys.  Sounds like the typical James Bond film.  Now that we have that comparison out of the way, we can try and judge the movie on its merits.  The acting was typical of a Tom Cruise movie; believable but not great.  The dialogue was realistic but not captivating.  The special effects were good, but not mesmerizing.  The action scenes mixed half-speed and full-speed scenes, all of which looked overly choreographed to be real.  And the soundtrack; it sounded the same as all the other MI movies.

522432,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,B00003CXDF,Priscilla Stafford,"[2, 3]","Mission Impossible 2 has Tom Cruise playing Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent. He is sent on a mission to stop another IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who has sold out and stolen a deadly genetically-engineered virus. Having both the virus and the cure, Ambrose's plan is to release the virus and him having the only antidote, will be filthy rich. Using the help of Nyah Nordof-Hall (Thandie Newton), Ambrose's ex-girlfriend, Ethan Hunt go after Ambrose.First, the problems with this movie: 1) The director John Woo may have made this movie exploding with action, but why did he have to have so many slow motion scenes? Also, sometimes you see the same scene repeated over and over. Whenever it does that, I always blink my eyes a couple of times to make sure I'm not seeing double! 2) The plot is so very, very simple, you can already guess the ending. 3) I don't know how Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt could have fallen for Nyah Nordof-Hall (Thandie Newton)? The romance wasn't that hot. Like when they first meet, their eyes are locked for what seems like eternity (or was it that long?)... Cruise's and Newton's face don't change at all! 4) As some other people have stated, some of the things Tom Cruise were just next to impossible that it seemed silly! (Later I'll explain how sometimes this isn't so bad.) Like when Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott crash into each other, jumping off their motorcycles. 5) The showdown at the end with Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott was too, too, long. Every time you feel like it was going to finish, one or the other gets out a gun or a knife.All right, finally, to the good parts. 1) Like I said before, some of the stunts and action were just too impossible. But this movie is mission impossible so some parts I didn't mind like when the knife comes very, VERY close to Hunt's eye. That scared the life out of me! 2) The action was really awesome! Like when Hunt is trapped in the laboratory and when he climbs the cliffs in the beginning.As for the special features, there's so many things you can look at. There's one feature I particularily like, the &quot;Impossible Shots&quot; with interviews with Tom Cruise, John Woo and Stunt Coordinator Brian Smrz. There is one hitch though, I can't tell if John Woo is speaking English or not! He has the worst accent you've ever heard and he keeps repeating the same words! Whenever I see these &quot;Impossible Shots&quot;, I always skip the part with John Woo. Believe me, you're not missing much.So, here's my conclusion for this movie. It's not that great, not that bad. This is the type of entertainment which you don't have to think so much to watch it, just be dazzled by the effects.

One can sense the angst and uncertainty of early 1990's Hong Kong where its citizens seemed to ignore the looming imminence of the Chinese takeover of the city.Yet when Cruise's character almost never gets a scratch, he seems too cocky.

522444,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXDF,Roland E. Zwick,"[29, 43]","John Woo's ""Mission: Impossible 2"" represents much that is wrong with commercial moviemaking today.  Though proficient on the levels of technical expertise, visual design and state-of-the-art special effects, the film emerges as little more than a multimillion dollar exercise in cold efficiency, devoid of humor, suspense and, above all, heart.  Thus, while countless superior films - films that attempt to make some connection with the reality of the human condition - languish at the box office, ""Mission: Impossible 2"" and other films if its ilk play to packed movie houses.  Do people really enjoy this film, or are they just suckered into believing that any film that is sold as an ""event"" picture - particularly one that stars the ubiquitous Tom Cruise - must by its nature be worth the price of admission?""Mission: Impossible 2"" features an opening credit sequence that proves that just because something ""can"" be done doesn't necessarily mean that it ""should"" be done - a warning filmmakers should heed now that, with computer graphics, virtually every situation imaginable has become possible to visualize convincingly.  We are reintroduced to Cruise's spy character as he is climbing up the face of a sheer cliff sans ropes or cables.  Although the shot looks absolutely convincing from a technical standpoint, we simply cannot believe that anyone in his right mind would be doing what he is doing - or even if those actions are themselves within the realm of physical possibility.  From its opening note then, ""MI 2"" informs us that it is not concerned in any way with making everything we see believable and involving.  As a result, we tune out, detaching ourselves from the events on the screen, becoming disinterested bystanders of a trite espionage scenario that, for all its visual finesse, is strangely lacking in creativity and passion.The first ""Mission: Impossible"" film, made in 1996, may have been a monument to incoherence, but at least it half redeemed itself by offering two spectacular and unforgettable action set pieces - Cruise's dangling marionette act and a mano-a-mano fight atop a roaring, supersonic train.  The sequel offers no such action scene equivalents.  The car chase early in the film between Cruise and the sexy thief he is pursuing is a yawn-inducing bore compared to the ones in the exciting ""Ronin"" from a few years back.  The shootouts are equally undistinguished, far below par for a Woo film.Like many films that rely so heavily on special effects and action sequences, ""MI 2"" never exerts the slightest effort to flesh out its many characters.  One would expect that a writer with the talent and track record of Robert Towne (he wrote ""Chinatown"" for heavens sake) would at least be able to provide some character dimension even within the tight confines of the action genre.  Unfortunately, all the characters emerge as cardboard cutout figures, substituting coolness and slickness for personality and depth.  Cruise and Thandie Newton generate zero chemistry in the romance department, and John Polson seems woefully inadequate as the film's main villain.If you must check ""MI2"" out, by all means do.

Once infected, ""Chimaera"" disintegrates blood cells over the course of two days. The cure is worthless because nobody has yet contracted the disease which exists only on a few petri dishes inside a lab bristling with high-tech and ""safely"" ensonced within a highly-secured office tower in Melbourne. Knowing the target and the likely theives, Tom Cruise must break into the lab and destroy the disease before the thieves get to it. Quickly pegging the rogue agents responsible, Cruise enlists the aid of Nyah (Thandie Newton), a professional thief and former lover of one of the agents. Her job isn't to steal the virus, just ""coax"" the agent into locating it. That's the plot....Director John Woo tosses out the subtleties that De Palma tried wreaking in the first MI, instead tieing the script along with action sequences that don't get excite as much as annoy. The idea of turncoat IMF spies is intriguing, and the evil Sean Ambrose has some of his own tricks, but Woo doesn't do much with the possibility, directing as with a 9mm.

When will Hollywood learn that bigger explosions and bigger budget doesn't make a better sequel, that's why most sequels fail to be even loyal to the first. That is exactly what happens here. Director John Woo, best known for his fascinating heroic bloodshed movies (The Killer, a better tomorrow, face/off)tries to brings his wonders to this flick. Unfortunately he fails to bring them in right to this sequel. The problem here is that it lacks the goodies of the first. The main issue is the mood; it is completely different from the first film. Whereas The first M:I had a nice blend of espionage and action, this one is an exaggerated/story less sequel. It felt more like a bad James Bond movie then it felt like a good spy movie.The movie's thin plot surrounds upon a man made lethal virus, deadly enough to kill someone in 48 hours. The plan is to release the virus and then make money from selling the antidote how original.. Right? The rest is Tom Cruise doing crazy stunts, and exaggerating his persona. Now the movie does have a lot of good action sequences that's for sure, and it sounds and looks nice on screen and john woo is known for that, known for making action look like poetry. But it doesn't do  justice to the movie, it only makes it exaggerating; just because the action may look cool doesn't mean it will make a movie good, you need story also, which I felt was missing here. And the story they chose was bland and soulless. The fact  is that this movie is a Tom Cruise vehicle rather than a team work espionage. It doesn't have the chemistry of the TV series nor of the first movie.

522468,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00003CXDF,S. Schell,"[2, 4]","Wow, what a letdown. Even Tom Cruise can't save this big-budget impracticality. Almost everything in this film is garish and amplified, the outrageous stunts and computerized effects in particular. This film supersedes the original not because it is more entertaining, but because it will be long remembered for its over-the-top tackiness and implausibility.Tom Cruise returns as the dexterous Ethan Hunt, and gosh, we just didn't know this guy was brave enough to FREECLIMB on the tallest rock formations known to man! How unreal is this? His character seems less smug than in MI and too smarmy in this one. This completely takes away from the audience taking him seriously. There are bouts when you think the old Ethan will return with his arrogant charisma and ineffaceable intelligence, but his unbecoming romanticism competes and eventually wins and his adventurous spirit is forever lost in the opaque plot. Jon Voigt was a sophisticated rogue in MI, but this time 'round the bad guy Sean Ambrose is overly dramatized by Scottish thespian Dougray Scott, the charming prince in the Drew Barrymore vehicle &quot;Ever After&quot;. This disappointed me more than surprised me, for Scott is too dignified of a dramatic actor to submit himself to such cinematic smut.Thandie Newton, a Zimbabwean-British bi-product that has graced such films as &quot;Besieged&quot;, &quot;Beloved&quot; and &quot;The Journey of August King&quot; is Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a ravishing kleptomaniac that becomes enraptured by Ethan's debonair appeal and acute prowess. They, of course, end up in bed together but the problem is that it happens in the first ten minutes of the film. Where's the sexual tension that existed between Ethan and Claire (Emmanuelle Beart) in the original? There's no build-up here - Newton and Cruise tumble immediately after she is recruited. Boring! This is not the first time Thandie has appeared in a film with Cruise, although she was not the object of his desire in the other. Her name was Yvette, the beautiful, busty servant that Brad Pitt remorsefully drained in the anemic adaptation of Anne Rice's re-popularized novel &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot;.Now if you think the acting was bad, get a load of the outlandish plot. The basis of MI2 is the eradication of a deadly virus known as Chimera, a powerful microbe that survives in the bloodstream and decimates blood cells, depleting the body's defenses and rendering them helpless against certain death in a mere 20 hours. Other details given in the movie make it sound vaguely familiar to a plague in the South American countries known as Ebola. The plot of MI was a lot more palpable and exciting, I think. It provided more intrigue and suspense. MI2 simply makes a flashy cabaret of everything.Where as Brian DePalma saved face by turning a favorite sixties suspense show into a crowd-pleasing exploit, we now have slow-mo king John Woo taking charge, a veteran of such projects as the Travolta/Cage frolic &quot;Face Off&quot; and 1996's espionage thriller &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;. The problem with this is that Woo prolongs a great deal of screen time by slowing frames unneccessarily and showcasing Cruise's acrobatics with exaggerated enthusiasm. So Tom did a cartwheel - so what? Even though Thandie is a beautiful woman, almost every shot of her is a slow saunter, her ebony locks whipping in the ubiquitous ocean breezes. I kept waiting for them to play some cheesy love theme whenever this happened.David Koepp and Steve Zaillian should've been recruited again for writing credits, but instead we have Bruce Geller (who wrote for the original MI series) and Ronald D. Moore (a writer for the WB series &quot;Roswell&quot;) as the head honchos. Robert Towne reclaims his credit of the screenplay, but I think he lost a great deal of his creative freedom by honoring veteran writer Geller with zealous leeway of the text. I think all the dollar signs in Geller's eyes blinded him from the genius he once had, aloowing himself to get carried away with today's innovative movie magic. This is how the inconceivable stunts were birthed, a prime example being the scene with the dueling motorcycles. Perhaps Geller watched too many Schwarzenegger flicks before coming into the project and was highly disillusioned by them.Overall, MI2 is a far-fetched sequel to the impressive inauguration of a TV series into film, but my decree of a two-star rating is more than adequate. I give it mostly to Ving Rhames, who loses none of the appeal he gained in the first MI. Anthony Hopkins as Mission Commander Swanbeck was merely a name. He wasn't even credited for his appearance! If you want a good action flick that is believable for the most part, watch DePalma's creation. MI2 is a cinematic burnout.",2,Mission Implausible,974764800,"11 21, 2000",2000,4775,"['Wow', 'what', 'letdown', 'Even', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'big-budget', 'impracticality',

The essential problem is a mismatch of talents. Robert Towne is a wonderful writer, and his ""Notorious"" knock-off script might have worked in a different franchise, but as a ""Mission: Impossible"" scenario it's too dated, too simple and too slow. Similarly, John Woo is master of a certain kind of action, and he shines momentarily in the few opportunities the script gives him, but for the rest of the time he's struggling. The result is a film that's plain boring. Ugly and boring. Hans Zimmer's rhythmic score is about the only thing to keep you interested. But even that fails in the tragic/romantic moments when Zimmer shamelessly re-uses his own work from ""Gladiator"", suddenly making you realize how emotionally uninvolving this film is by comparison. For Australian audiences, ""M:I-2"" offers some particularly exquisite tortures: a great actor like Richard Roxburgh murdering a South-African(?) accent; well-known Sydney locations trying to pass for Seville; and the mind-boggling casting of John Polson which, in retrospect, is probably quite appropriate - the finished film has the amateurish look and feel of a mediocre entry for his annual short film festival, 'Tropfest'.  This movie gives us nothing we haven't seen before and considerably less than we deserve. Doing a better job wouldn't have been impossible. Not even difficult.

Ambrose disguises himself as Hunt early on in the film, to steal the vaccine from it's creator, making Hunt itching for some payback, & at first, making the IMF question Hunt's loyalties.Ethan must first, contact & hook up with Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a thief & former lover of Ambrose's. Second, Ethan has to not only retrieve the vaccine, but, also must get to the virus before Ambrose does. Easier said than done, after all this is ""Mission: Impossible"".""M:I 2"" is easily the weakest of three ""M:I"" movies. Although, the plot is pretty solid, their are some holes. The big one for me, was at the end of the film when Nyah is infected. Her symptoms are nowhere near as bad as the scientist at the beginning of the film. She's concious, there is no blood loss, & she just seems to be stumbling around like a drunk (yeah, she looks infected to me & I totally f**king bought it).This is Tom Cruise's vanity project. I know between takes somebody had a mirror in front of him, making sure somebody loved him.Dougray Scott was originally offered the role of Wolverine in ""The X-Men"", but, due to over shooting on this film he had no choice but to pass on the role. Enter Hugh Jackman. Snikt! Exit Dougray Scott's career.The action is a bit much in this film & is the absolute big drawback to ""M:I 2"".

522491,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00003CXDF,Tom Benton,"[1, 1]","Let me begin by telling you two things.  One: I really liked the 1996 film adaptation of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  Two: John Woo is one of my favorite directors.  It would seem to me, and to countless others, that John Woo directing MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II would be a dream come true.  Perhaps it was because of high expectations that audiences were so disappointed with Woo's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II.While the plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was deep and jumbled enough to throw many people off, the plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II is so miniscule that it's nearly non-existent.  Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), an IMF (Impossible Mission Force) spy, is ordered to recruit a beautiful thief (Thandie Newton) and work with her in a mission to destroy ""Chimera"", a genetically-modified disease that could kill millions.  Hunt and the thief, named Nyah, become romantically attached to each other, and things begin to get complicated.One of the most interesting things about the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE film series is seeing how each director handles the material.  Brian De Palma's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was filled with shady characters and conspiracies.  J.J. Abrams' MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III was an energetic, action-packed thrill ride.  John Woo's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II is substantially different from each of those films.  It has nothing in common with De Palma's film at all.  It is, however, loaded with intense action sequences.  This will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with director Woo's previous films.Indeed, there are some scenes in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II which only John Woo could pull off.  The movie is loaded with Woo's trademark slo-mo action and over-the-top stunts.  Memorable scenes include Ethan Hunt wielding dual pistols (something done by numerous other characters in legendary scenes from Woo's Chinese films) and a scene in which a lone white dove emerges from a line of flames.  As an operatic bit of Hans Zimmer's very fine score begins playing, Ethan Hunt walks past the flames, glaring in at the film's villain - who is, by the way, played by Dougray Scott.Any movie directed by John Woo is sure to blow away most action fans, but MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II should really knock their socks off.  The plot is small enough to give Woo time to focus on the action scenes, while keeping the film a few steps away from mediocrity.  (Screenwriter Robert Towne has said that he based his script on action scenes which John Woo told him that he wanted to direct.)  Cruise's Hunt comes off, at times, as an American James Bond.  His performance conveys a strong sense of urgency and, occasionally, desperation, which really adds to the overall intensity of the film.What John Woo's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II lacks in depth is made up for with perfectly-executed action sequences guaranteed to satisfy the action fan.  Despite a primarily-negative audience response, this is a good sequel that very narrowly misses the mark.",3,A good sequel that narrowly misses the mark,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,2921,"['Let', 'begin', 'telling', 'two', 'things', 'One', 'really', 'liked', '1996', 'film', 'adaptation', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'Two', 'John', 'Woo', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'would', 'seem', 'countless', 'others', 'John', 'Woo', 'directing', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'II', 'would', 'be', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'high', 'expectations', 'audiences', 'were', 'so', 'disappointed', 'Woo', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'II.While', 'plot', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'was', 'deep', 'jumbled', 'enough', 'throw', 'many', 'people', 'plot', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'II', 'so', 'miniscule', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'IMF', 'Impossible', 'Mission', 'Force', 'spy', 'ordered', 'recruit', 'beautiful', 'thief', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'work', 'mission', 'destroy', 'Chimera', 'genetically-modified', 'disease', 'could', 'kill', 'millions', 'Hunt', 'thief', 'named', 'Nyah', 'become', 'romantically', 'attached', 'other', 'things', 'begin', 'get', 'complicated.One', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'film', 'series', 'seeing', 'how', 'director', 'material', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'was', 'filled', 'shady', 'characters', 'conspiracies', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'III', 'was', 'energetic', 'action-packed', 'thrill', 'ride', 'John', 'Woo', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'II', 'substantially', 'different', 'films', 'nothing', 'common', 'De', 'Palma', 'film', 'however', 'loaded', 'intense', 'action', 'sequences', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'director', 'Woo', 'previous', 'films.Indeed', 'are', 'scenes', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'II', 'only', 'John', 'Woo', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'movie', 'loaded', 'Woo', 'trademark', 'slo-mo', 'action', 'over-the-top', 'stunts', 'Memorable', 'scenes', 'include', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'wielding', 'dual', 'pistols', 'something', 'done', 'numerous', 'other', 'characters', 'legendary', 'scenes', 'Woo', 'Chinese', 'films', 'scene', 'lone', 'white', 'dove', 'emerges', 'line', 'flames', 'operatic', 'bit', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'very', 'fine', 'score', 'playing', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'walks', 'flames', 'glaring', 'film', 'villain', 'who', 'way', 'played', 'Dougray', 'Scott.Any', 'movie', 'directed', 'John', 'Woo', 'sure', 'blow', 'away', 'most', 'action', 'fans', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'II', 'should', 'really', 'knock', 'socks', 'plot', 'small', 'enough', 'give', 'Woo', 'time', 'focus', 'action', 'scenes', 'keeping', 'film', 'few', 'steps', 'away', 'mediocrity', 'Screenwriter', 'Robert', 'Towne', 'said', 'based', 'script', 'action', 'scenes', 'John', 'Woo', 'told', 'wanted', 'direct', 'Cruise', 'Hunt', 'off', 'times', 'American', 'James', 'Bond', 'performance', 'conveys', 'strong', 'sense', 'urgency', 'occasionally', 'desperation', 'really', 'overall', 'intensity', 'film.What', 'John', 'Woo', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'II', 'depth', 'made', 'up', 'perfectly-executed', 'action', 'sequences', 'guaranteed', 'satisfy', 'action', 'fan', 'primarily-negative', 'audience', 'response', 'good', 'sequel', 'very', 'narrowly', 'mark']",N/A

Ain't happenin'.The producers of Mission Impossible appear to have decided to take the gentle, wry and thoughtful concepts of the original mid-60's TV series with clever characters who outwitted their nefarious opponents and apply some millennial bling.  Elements such as the iconic self-destructing tape recorder, lifelike face-masks, and musical score were retained and enhanced.  The rest was replaced with Tom Cruise and a remarkably hot actress, as well as some ... more modern ... special effects.(Watching a movie made in 2000 in 2014 should convince you that technology has indeed advanced; back in 2000, digital cameras having any remotely useful photographic qualities cost ten's of thousands of dollars and were years away from being a common item.  This in this movie, digital cameras are featured as a prominent high-tech gadget.  Of course we now all carry far more sophisticated cameras along with our pocket sized computers, phones, internet connections and movie screens.  And we no longer make special effort to emphasize the digital aspects of the cameras, as was necessary in this film.)Indeed, one must assume a certain artistic license taken by producers who indeed decided to put the action into the action film M:I-2 was very much billed as.  And action we got, from the very opening scene.  There were several moments of calm and quiet during the obligatory and tastefully edited sex scene.  Otherwise, it was action.  And lifelike face-masks (whose technology, naturally, has become far more versatile and ubiquitous in these decades since the 60's.)The action was truly impressive.  Our hero was truly heroic -- quoting Wikipedia &#34;in the face of danger and adversity or from a position of weakness, displays courage and the will for self sacrifice ... for some greater good of all humanity.&#34;  While Wikipedia doesn't specifically mention motorcycle or aerial skills, or remarkable marksmanship, these characteristics shown by the M:I-2 hero are without doubt close to the original definition, again quoting Wikipedia, referring to &#34;martial courage or excellence&#34;.So if it surprises you that it would be possible to take an accurate shot using a handgun at long distance, while spinning on the front wheel of a dirt bike after a hard brake and multiple minutes of physically exhausting fights before, perhaps you're failing to understand the idea of heroism, mythology, or action films with Tom Cruise.  I am guessing the other critics here also found movies like Avatar or perhaps Alien unrealistic.  Both were incredible movies, also with incredibly hot actresses (although admittedly in these latter cases, the actresses had the lead).  Enough said on that point.I encourage you to come into the experience of M:I-2 with expectations set appropriately.  Be prepared to suspend your disbelief (be very prepared).  Under these conditions, you will not be disappointed.",5,"This movie is everything it was meant to be, and more",1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,3415,"['When', 'eat', 'escargot', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', '34', 'Eeew', 'too', 'much', 'butter.', '34', 'Escargot', 'are', 'snails', 'butter.When', 'watch', 'cartoons', 'Road', 'Runner', 'air', 'several', 'seconds', 'falling', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', '34', 'unrealistic', 'representation', 'how', 'force', 'gravity', 'acts', 'falling', 'bodies', 'perhaps', 'was', 'updraft', 'canyon', 'wall.', '34', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'neither', 'should', 'expect', 'lowfat', 'escargot', 'strict', 'adherence', 'laws', 'physics', 'Ai', ""n't"", ""happenin'.The"", 'producers', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'appear', 'have', 'decided', 'take', 'gentle', 'wry', 'thoughtful', 'concepts', 'original', 'mid-60', 'TV', 'series', 'clever', 'characters', 'who', 'outwitted', 'nefarious', 'opponents', 'apply', 'millennial', 'bling', 'Elements', 'such', 'iconic', 'self-destructing', 'tape', 'recorder', 'face-masks', 'musical', 'score', 'were', 'retained', 'enhanced', 'rest', 'was', 'replaced', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'remarkably', 'hot', 'actress', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'modern', 'special', 'effects', 'Watching', 'movie', 'made', '2000', '2014', 'should', 'convince', 'technology', 'indeed', 'advanced', 'back', '2000', 'digital', 'cameras', 'having', 'remotely', 'useful', 'photographic', 'qualities', 'cost', ""'s"", 'thousands', 'dollars', 'were', 'years', 'away', 'being', 'common', 'item', 'movie', 'digital', 'cameras', 'are', 'featured', 'prominent', 'high-tech', 'gadget', 'course', 'now', 'carry', 'far', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'cameras', 'pocket', 'sized', 'computers', 'phones', 'internet', 'connections', 'movie', 'screens', 'no', 'longer', 'make', 'special', 'effort', 'emphasize', 'digital', 'aspects', 'cameras', 'was', 'necessary', 'film', 'Indeed', 'must', 'assume', 'certain', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'producers', 'who', 'indeed', 'decided', 'put', 'action', 'action', 'film', 'M', 'I-2', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'billed', 'action', 'got', 'very', 'opening', 'scene', 'were', 'several', 'moments', 'calm', 'quiet', 'obligatory', 'tastefully', 'edited', 'sex', 'scene', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'action', 'lifelike', 'face-masks', 'technology', 'naturally', 'become', 'far', 'more', 'versatile', 'ubiquitous', 'decades', '60', 'action', 'was', 'truly', 'impressive', 'hero', 'was', 'truly', 'heroic', 'quoting', 'Wikipedia', '34', 'face', 'danger', 'adversity', 'position', 'weakness', 'displays', 'courage', 'will', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'greater', 'good', 'humanity.', '34', 'Wikipedia', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'mention', 'motorcycle', 'aerial', 'skills', 'remarkable', 'marksmanship', 'characteristics', 'shown', 'M', 'I-2', 'hero', 'are', 'doubt', 'close', 'original', 'definition', 'again', 'quoting', 'Wikipedia', 'referring', '34', 'martial', 'courage', 'excellence', '34', '.So', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'take', 'accurate', 'shot', 'using', 'handgun', 'long', 'distance', 'spinning', 'front', 'wheel', 'dirt', 'bike', 'hard', 'brake', 'multiple', 'minutes', 'physically', 'exhausting', 'fights', 'perhaps', ""'re"", 'failing', 'understand', 'idea', 'heroism', 'mythology', 'action', 'films', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'am', 'guessing', 'other', 'critics', 'here', 'also', 'found', 'movies', 'Avatar', 'perhaps', 'Alien', 'unrealistic', 'were', 'incredible', 'movies', 'also', 'incredibly', 'hot', 'actresses', 'admittedly', 'latter', 'cases', 'actresses', 'had', 'lead', 'Enough', 'said', 'point.I', 'encourage', 'come', 'experience', 'M', 'I-2', 'expectations', 'set', 'appropriately', 'Be', 'prepared', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'be', 'very', 'prepared', 'conditions', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

The result... a sequel that became more successful than the original, a rare case indeed.  Upon viewing the movie, one might be able to easily contrast the opening sequence to that of a 007 James Bond flick.  Which was a trend that continued throughout the rest of the movie.  But what is painfully clear is that Woo was more interested in exhibiting special effects than he was in making an enduring American classic.  The movie is chalk-full of explosions, elaborate sets, and vehicle stunts.  And the acting to action ratio leaves much to be desired for the typical film critic.  And in spite of anticipating a generic mission that involves danger, bombs, villains, and heroes... the plot of the movies becomes lost in a sea of over-played special effects, terribly fictitional stunts, and just good, old-fashioned bad acting.  Yes, it's easy to tell which movies will support the weight of rotten tomatoes when the soundtrack for the film draws more attention than the mediocre movie itself.

Woo's disastrous sequel - at the time the most expensive film ever made - is like an endless hairspray commercial, with the ever limited Cruise (who used to be able to act but now just runs off a checklist of six annoying expressions) constantly flicking his hair in glowing slo-mo - you keep on expecting him to say 'Because I'm worth it.' Unfortunately, they're so busy making him look pretty that they forget to include any of the basics of a Summer movie. The action scenes are few and far between and not worth the wait; the script is another lazy and lifeless stinker from Robert Towne that rivals his Love Affair for banal inconsequentiality; and the Brits in the cast let the side down even more than Woo, Cruise and Towne combined - Thandie Newton seems semi-comatose, Hopkins hams it up and cashes the cheque, while Dougray Scott demonstrates just how dull an actor he can be even when mugging relentlessly. The only good thing that came of this film was the over-runs keeping Scott from playing Wolverine in X-Men: judging from his subsequent performances on screen and stage, if being boring on screen was an Olympic sport, this guy would win Scotland gold every time.Possibly the most tedious vanity production ever made.

MI2 though suffers from a deplorable lack of action, at least early on anyways. Although, it's visually stunning at times, there's really nothing here to grab you. I thought this film had very little to do with the Mission Impossible series, and more resembled John Woo's normal action films. The main problem with the film, is that it's main character, Ethan Hawke, played by Tom Cruise, gets involved in a very, long and drawn out relationship with his female co-star. The film spends far too much developing the relationship between the two, and far too little time giving us action.

522507,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00003CXDF,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 7]","""MI2"" is a rarity among sequels--it's actually comparable to the first film in terms of action with better action sequences than Brian DePalma's strong first entry in this franchise. Based on the 1966 TV show (which also spawned another TV show that failed to find an audience), ""MI2"" works because of John Woo's carefully choregraphed action sequences and the action packed script by Robert Towne (writer of""Chinatown"", ""Shampoo"" -and also the awful ""Days of Thunder"")based on a story by Ron Moore & Brannon Braga who wrote ""Star Trek: First Contact""). While the character development could be stronger, the story is fairly weak but what makes this film work is the action sequences although it seems they are trying to make Hunt into more of a Bond character.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise before his public relations meltdown)must stop the bioengineered virus Chimera from being used to create a worldwide epidemic. It seems that a former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott)has intercepted the cure and is holding it for ransom. Hunt must assemble an IMF team quickly which icludes Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Billy Baird (John Polson) and a civilian Nyah (Thandie Newton)who was previously involved with Ambrose. Hunt is working with a deadline because the virus kills rapidly and he must prevent Ambrose and his henchmen from working out a deal with Biotech CEO John McCloy (Brendan Gleeson).The transfer from Paramount looks pretty good although it doesn't appear as sharp looking as more recent releases (it came out in 2000 on DVD). If you purchased the single disc set stick with it; the second disc in the two disc set is a waste of money.The first disc comes with some nice extras including a 15 minute featurette, a 30 minute section on the stunts that includes interviews with director John Woo and the stunt crew. This can be viewed as separate featurettes on each stunt and includes storyboards. Metallica's music video ""I Disappear"" also appears as well as an alternate opening sequence, the MTV Movie Awards parody ""Mission Improbable"" and interviews with Woo, Cruise and stunt coordinator Brian Smrz.

Everyone thought it would be THE BEST summer movie.  You're wrong!The storyline is watered down.  It's about a virus that was engineered that is lethal enough to kill you in less than two days or some sort like that.  The storyline did get predictable and tries to be emotive, but just doesn't cause anything.  The movie is like a James Bond movie, Tom Cruise meets a hot girl and that's about it.  The movie tries to be shocking and wants you to predict what will happen next, but watching 20 minutes of the film, most people knew what was coming to them.  The movie tries to shock you with people having on masks of other people, then have artificial voices.  That act gets pretty lame.  It gets very tedious and monotonous after people do the mask 'n voice trick about five times.The action sequences just aren't cut out compared to the other movies this summer, and the martial arts sequences are very dull.  One of Cruise's stuntmen do all the martial arts techniques, but still, they aren't very well choreographed, and very unrealistic.  A real martial artist wouldn't do the fanciest of moves that are just a waste of time (like going, do a rainbow side slash kick just to knock a gun out of one's hands) then all the other dumb attacks aren't cut for a real person.  If someone spent two seconds to do a back flip, the guy would just shoot you before you even get your feet up unless your attacks are direct!The shooting scenes are also pretty lame.  It's like a move in, shoot security guards, then hide behind a wall then shoot than do one dive and shoot.

522510,A1QF10TB8AYTA3,B00003CXDF,"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja""","[0, 1]","It's hard to describe just how bad this movie is, but I'll try to give it a crack.The problem with MI 2 is that it does not live up to the series trademark to deliver an entertaining thrill ride similar to the Bond films. Ironically, there are plenty of death defying stunts and cool actions sequences that should have been amazing. But they are not, they're very dull and lack merit.All right let's get this party started:1.) The movie is poorly edited. I read on IMDB that they had to replace the editor who was going to work on this film because he got into an accident. Well, they clearly didn't spend enough time finding a suitable replacement, because the edits in this film are terrible.Jump cuts, terrible pacing, and amateur takes that should have never made it into a blockbuster film like this.Examples: When Tom Cruise finally kills the villain and shoots him, the villain's body is already collapsing from the bullet wound. You never actually see him get shot, but the way he's falling looks so cheesy and corny that it was cringe worthy to watch.The climactic scene where the villain is about to get the virus uses one of Hans Zimmers most beautiful songs: InjectionAND TOTALLY FAILS to deliver a satisfying action sequence. It was weak, empty, useless, and had zero emotion. The music did not belong with that scene and it shows. Just thinking about what a failure that scene was makes me angry.2.) The characters are dull, boring, and unrealistic in a not so fun way. The villain is the absolute worst. This was some of the worst acting I've seen in a film and the motivations and dialogues of the characters didn't help matters. The supporting characters for Tom Cruise were under utilized and given bit parts that weren't very funny at all.Also, very annoying is how quickly Tom Cruise's character Ethan instantly falls in love with the &#34;bond girl&#34; at the start of the movie. No date, no life-saving interaction, no build up to why they should care about each other. It's simply &#34;You girl, me man, I love you.&#34;When Bond gets a girl, it's usually just a fling or to get information. But Ethan genuinely fell in love with this woman without any precedent! This movie is two hours long, the least they could have done is thrown in some character development.3.) Action sequences felt forced and unnecessary. Perfect example is when Ethan is trying to recruit the bond girl for his mission. She says, &#34;If you want me, you'll have to catch me.&#34; And for no reason we have a car chase over winding streets on a mountain road.Look, I love action, but it has to have a purpose. It can't just be action for the sake of action, otherwise it's boring.Rather than go on and on about how bad this movie is, let me just end my review with this.The other Mission Impossible movies are way better than this one.

The story although not really all that original seems to flow along well.I watched the movie to escape reality for a couple of hours, and it was a pleasant diversion from the real world.

522517,A2HE4RHOGMWDV8,B00003CXDF,Young Kim,"[0, 1]","The opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for the movie.  We are introduced to a buffed-up, shaggy-haired Tom Cruise climbing the vertical face of a rocky cliff in the middle of some barren landscape.  It is a beautiful, breath taking, death-defying ballet, but it is an entirely solo act.  The premise of the television series was that a group of skilled government operatives would be brought in based on their specialties and orchestrate a complex mission.  The first MI movie actually showed some of this spirit in the opening embassy sequence, but lost its steam as the complexity of the plot wore that movie out.MI:2 is basically all Tom Cruise all the time.  He drives, he fights, he dons disguise after disguise, he jumps, he kicks, he hides, and does all those things that action stars do.  Sure, there are a couple of support agents, but one is a glorified chauffeur, and the other just looks at a computer screen and looks worried.  The plot is standard action movie fare.  Bad guy, a former MI operative himself, wants to get his hands on a ultra-deadly toxin and its vaccine.  He plans to use it to demand billions from Australia, and the only one who can stop him is Mr. Cruise.  The key lies with a former lover of the villain.  A jewel thief, played by the beautiful Thandie Newton, she is recruited by Mr. Cruise, and they both promptly fall in love.  Much mayhem and destruction follow, as well as the predictable twists and turns, which climax in a mano-a-mano between hero and villain.The movie bears the hallmarks of the direction, noted Hong Kong action filmmaker John Woo.  There are the beautifully choreographed gun fights, the use of slow motion to enhance the drama and the mood of the characters, as well as the requisite doves flying in slow motion.  The special effects are par for the course, with plenty of explosions, bullets and locations that seemed to have been built for the sole purpose of being destroyed during gun fights.  One special effect that is particularly effective (until it is used for the upteenth time) is the removal of masks.  It is truly fantastic what a leap in technology we have from MI:1's mask removal sequence and MI:2's mask scenes.All in all, it is an average action movie that strays too far from the more cerebral Mission Impossible roots to land squarely in James Bond territory - there is even an M like character portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins.",3,Mediocre action movie w/o the spirit of the TV series,971827200,"10 18, 2000",2000,2420,"['opening', 'sequence', 'movie', 'tone', 'movie', 'are', 'introduced', 'buffed-up', 'shaggy-haired', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'climbing', 'vertical', 'face', 'rocky', 'cliff', 'middle', 'barren', 'landscape', 'beautiful', 'breath', 'taking', 'death-defying', 'ballet', 'entirely', 'solo', 'act', 'premise', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'group', 'skilled', 'government', 'operatives', 'would', 'be', 'brought', 'based', 'specialties', 'orchestrate', 'complex', 'mission', 'first', 'MI', 'movie', 'actually', 'showed', 'spirit', 'opening', 'embassy', 'sequence', 'lost', 'steam', 'complexity', 'plot', 'wore', 'movie', 'out.MI:2', 'basically', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'time', 'disguise', 'disguise', 'things', 'action', 'stars', 'do', 'Sure', 'are', 'couple', 'support', 'agents', 'one', 'glorified', 'chauffeur', 'other', 'just', 'computer', 'screen', 'worried', 'plot', 'standard', 'action', 'movie', 'fare', 'Bad', 'guy', 'former', 'MI', 'operative', 'get', 'hands', 'ultra-deadly', 'toxin', 'vaccine', 'use', 'demand', 'billions', 'Australia', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'stop', 'Mr.', 'Cruise', 'key', 'former', 'lover', 'villain', 'jewel', 'thief', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'recruited', 'Mr.', 'Cruise', 'promptly', 'fall', 'love', 'Much', 'mayhem', 'destruction', 'follow', 'as', 'well', 'predictable', 'twists', 'turns', 'climax', 'mano-a-mano', 'hero', 'villain.The', 'movie', 'hallmarks', 'direction', 'noted', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'filmmaker', 'John', 'Woo', 'are', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'gun', 'fights', 'use', 'slow', 'motion', 'enhance', 'drama', 'mood', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'requisite', 'doves', 'flying', 'slow', 'motion', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'par', 'course', 'plenty', 'explosions', 'bullets', 'locations', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'sole', 'purpose', 'being', 'destroyed', 'gun', 'fights', 'One', 'special', 'effect', 'particularly', 'effective', 'used', 'upteenth', 'time', 'removal', 'masks', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'what', 'leap', 'technology', 'have', 'MI:1', 'mask', 'removal', 'sequence', 'MI:2', 'mask', 'scenes.All', 'average', 'action', 'movie', 'too', 'far', 'more', 'cerebral', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'roots', 'land', 'squarely', 'James', 'Bond', 'territory', 'even', 'M', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins']",N/A

522519,A318RKL1I9ABCM,B00003CXDF,"""zaloop""","[3, 5]","MI2 is an okay film. It has some very good action sequences, especially at  the end, all covered pretty well by John Woo's direction (although, unfortunately, his slow-mo  style becomes a parody of itself). The scenery and set pieces are nice, adding to the international feel of the IMF  organization, the kind of diversity we see in  Bond films.But it's very disappointing, especially considering how  inventive the Brian DePalma original was (can't beat that ultra-fast bullet train finale). It's kept from being great  for many reasons. First of all, having a full-fledged romance plot between Cruise and Thandie Newton was a bad  mistake. There are no scenes that develop the characters of Ethan or Nyah, it's just extended from the isolated, spur-of- the-moment sleeping scene. Therefore, there's no point in extending it to the length it is. It would've been better  to keep the &quot;romance&quot; on the level of the temporary eloping that James Bond always engages in. At least  then it wouldn't interfere with time that could be spent on action.Second, the film is denied so much potential from  the fact that it has to be a PG-13 film. Action films are just better when there aren't these restrictions placed  on how much you can show. As it is, MI2 suffers greatly from being a PG-13 film, because it's not satisfying seeing  the action like this: (1) Ethan shoots his gun, and (2) it cuts to a guy falling down- you never see where the  bullets go. You never actually see them enter anyone. This is such a huge mistake on the filmmakers' parts.More on the  action: I was surprised at how little action there actually was. There are two brief scenes at the beginning (the  plane crash and the short car chase), and then there's a long, barren stretch of about an hour before we see any real  action again. Where's the balance? There's  a big, 15-minute action finale at the end, and I'm all for that, but at  least sprinkle some smaller sequences throughout the rest of the movie.Furthermore, the action itself is good,  quite good at times, but nothing original or special. Sometimes it got repetetive, and other times it even ripped its  prequel off, like when Hunt descends down into a building on a rope, thus mimicking the security-room break-in scene  from the original. The best sequence of the film is the final fight on the beach, and even then, it never reaches  the level of great. That martial arts kickfest tries to be a fraction as entertaining as a typical fight in The  Matrix. Take that scene, multiply the content and complexity by five, and speed everything up, and you have one of the  many typical fights in The Matrix. (This proves yet again that creating good action requires just as much thought and effort as creating a good story.) My point is, in a time when action films are really staking new ground and becoming  so unique, uninspired action like the stuff in MI2 just isn't special enough anymore to be called really good.",2,This film self-destructs.,976233600,"12 8, 2000",2000,2966,"['MI2', 'okay', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'especially', 'end', 'covered', 'pretty', 'well', 'John', 'Woo', 'direction', 'unfortunately', 'slow-mo', 'style', 'parody', 'scenery', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'nice', 'adding', 'international', 'feel', 'IMF', 'organization', 'kind', 'diversity', 'see', 'Bond', 'films.But', 'very', 'disappointing', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'inventive', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'original', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'ultra-fast', 'bullet', 'train', 'finale', 'kept', 'being', 'great', 'many', 'reasons', 'First', 'all', 'having', 'full-fledged', 'romance', 'plot', 'Cruise', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'was', 'bad', 'mistake', 'are', 'scenes', 'develop', 'characters', 'Ethan', 'Nyah', 'just', 'extended', 'isolated', 'spur-of-', 'the-moment', 'sleeping', 'scene', 'Therefore', 'point', 'extending', 'length', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'keep', 'quot', 'romance', 'quot', 'level', 'temporary', 'eloping', 'James', 'Bond', 'always', 'least', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'spent', 'action.Second', 'film', 'denied', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'fact', 'be', 'PG-13', 'film', 'Action', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'better', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'restrictions', 'placed', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'show', 'MI2', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'being', 'PG-13', 'film', 'not', 'satisfying', 'seeing', 'action', '1', 'Ethan', 'shoots', 'gun', '2', 'guy', 'falling', 'down-', 'never', 'see', 'where', 'bullets', 'go', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'enter', 'anyone', 'such', 'huge', 'mistake', 'filmmakers', 'parts.More', 'action', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'little', 'action', 'actually', 'was', 'are', 'two', 'brief', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'plane', 'crash', 'short', 'car', 'chase', 'then', 'long', 'barren', 'stretch', 'hour', 'see', 'real', 'action', 'again', 'Where', 'balance', 'big', '15-minute', 'action', 'finale', 'end', ""'m"", 'least', 'sprinkle', 'smaller', 'sequences', 'rest', 'movie.Furthermore', 'action', 'good', 'quite', 'good', 'times', 'nothing', 'original', 'special', 'got', 'repetetive', 'other', 'times', 'even', 'ripped', 'prequel', 'when', 'Hunt', 'down', 'building', 'rope', 'thus', 'mimicking', 'security-room', 'break-in', 'scene', 'original', 'best', 'sequence', 'film', 'final', 'fight', 'beach', 'even', 'then', 'never', 'level', 'great', 'martial', 'arts', 'kickfest', 'tries', 'be', 'fraction', 'as', 'entertaining', 'typical', 'fight', 'Matrix', 'Take', 'scene', 'multiply', 'content', 'complexity', 'five', 'speed', 'everything', 'up', 'have', 'one', 'many', 'typical', 'fights', 'Matrix', 'yet', 'again', 'creating', 'good', 'action', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'effort', 'creating', 'good', 'story', 'point', 'time', 'when', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'really', 'staking', 'new', 'ground', 'becoming', 'so', 'unique', 'uninspired', 'action', 'stuff', 'MI2', 'just', ""n't"", 'special', 'enough', 'anymore', 'be', 'called', 'really', 'good']",N/A
