It was mostly a person narrating still pictures and where there were performances they did not show them long at all.  :/,2,Not the best!,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,190,"['was', 'very', 'impersonal', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'images', 'portray', 'Elvis', 'was', 'mostly', 'person', 'narrating', 'still', 'pictures', 'where', 'were', 'performances', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'long', '/']",Elvis Presley: From the Beginning...to the End
847023,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B0002VEWW4,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[0, 0]","Overall, I found this to be a very good documentary, about Elvis' life, from childhood, up thru his untimely, early death. It covers how he became addicted to amphetamines (a stimulant drug), when he was in the Army, in Germany. Also, it covers how, he eventually had to take ""downer"" drugs, to go to sleep, and to counter act the stimulant drugs. It covers his career, and personal life, very well,but the only thing, that was missing, was his tenure on the Louisiana Hayride Radio Program, live from the historic, Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. It was while he was performing for the Louisiana Hayride, that he became very popular, and famous. Before, his tenure on the ""Hayride"", he performed on the Grand Ole Opry, but he was dismissed, and told to go back to driving a truck.Overall, it's my opinion, that it's a pretty good documentary of Elvis' life. I just wish they had covered his time on the ""Louisiana Hayride"", in Shreveport, Louisiana. By the way, they re-named the street in Shreveport, where the historic, Shreveport Municipal Auitorium is located. It was re-named Elvis Presley Blvd. Also, in front of the building, there is a statue of Elvis, along with a statue of his TCB (Taking Care of Business) Band, guitarist, Louisiana Native, James Burton. If you ever get the chance, I would highly recommend visiting the historic, Shreveport Municipal Auditorium, because, it is now a museam.

I am also an Elvis fan and I enjoyed watching his performances in the past.  In my opinion this appears to be very amateur attempt to make money off the Kings name!

I was just too board to sit through it all.  I hate it when I read the back of the DVD and it states that there are rare footage's on this DVD.....Horse Hockey!!  If you got the DVD's and Video's of Elvis In Hollywood or Elvis 56....then you'll won't see any new footage on this DVD.  In this DVD you'll here this corny music.  This DVD has a POOR and CHEAP quality.  There is this one guy that is a fan club president up in New York that's teaching the wrong versions of the stories of Elvis.  I wish I could kick his rear for claiming he is an expert on Elvis history.  Don't waste your money.... Fan's like us get sucker into these DVD's and wish they can get their money back...

It was just another dvd of Elvis from other people's point of view.  They all have their opinion and some are very different from others. First he is very good, then the next, he has a lot of demons to contend with.  It does get a little confusing.
