715028,A3U1MKMOJ7F6EO,B00006G8GS,Beatlefansincethen,"[8, 9]","I love this double sided DVD.For Amazon's low price you can't go wrong even though the picture quality on the Fun With the Fab Four side while not awful, isn't as good as the Beatles Unauthorized side.I'll start with Beatles Unauthorized.A standout is the Washington Coliseum concert shown almost in it's entirety with great fabulous sound and great picture.The harmonies on From Me To You are really lovely.What a great live band they were before 1966,and they weren't half bad in '66 for that matter.There is also newsreel footage of the Hollywood Bowl concert in '64 with comments from of all people Groucho Marx,Jack Benny,and Edward G. Robinson.These were the people who were sought by the media in 1964.What Beatles fan would care about their oppinions though?Don't get too excited about the concert footage.It's taken from one stationary camera(stage left)and you only get a side view of the fabs.It's still nice however.And for the best part although it's probably tied with the Washington footage,is the very last press conference in 1966,just after the Jesus nonsense had died down.You get pretty much the whole thing.Note John's barely concealed bitterness and anger as he sarcasticly answers the questions.Who could blame him after what he and the others had been through?Paul as usual is adoreable,tripping over his words and making a very, very funny comment which went over quite well.George always the gentleman,answers a rather banal question with grace and politeness and not a hint of annoyance.Loved this side of the disk.Fun With The Fab Four has interesting parts but there are a bit too many cutaways of Beatlemania scenes.This was annoying especially during a Swedish interview where the interviewer asks Paul,""What makes a girl good""? Yes he actually asks poor Paul this question. Talk about being in the hot seat!I would have liked to have seen his face as he answered it instead of a cutaway of some teenage geek screaming with outstretched arms.By the time it goes back to Paul,he's already answered with a very smooth,""Oh I don't know.""We get to see John though,egging Paul on by making him even more uncomfortable.""I'm just helping him!""Then,another cutaway of people speaking Swedish and showing off their stupid Beatle dresses.A lot of airport scenes and screaming people in horn rimmed glasses.Yes,I get it already. Beatlemania was quite a phenomenon but I'd rather see the people who were the cause of all this commotion.The most wonderful part of this side however,is a very long scene from the Around The Beatles TV special which aired in April 1964.You will see the boys performing a hilarious Shakespear comedy sketch complete with audience participation shouts of encouragement.Paul and George shout back too and John is a scream.Their delivery is deliberately deadpan,like a send up of a school play and it's priceless.It's worth buying this just to see that sketch but of course there's so much more to enjoy.Let's not forget newsreel footage of an angry city cop after the boys violate the curfew.Once again it's Paul in the hotseat.He's caught with a girl in his room.I guess he really did know what makes girls good. This DVD is 105 minutes of pure joy for Beatle fans.You will not be disappointed!",5,What a Treat!,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,3242,"['love', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD.For', 'Amazon', 'low', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'even', 'picture', 'quality', 'Fun', 'Fab', 'Four', 'side', 'not', 'awful', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Beatles', 'Unauthorized', 'side.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'Beatles', 'Unauthorized.A', 'standout', 'Washington', 'Coliseum', 'concert', 'shown', 'almost', 'entirety', 'great', 'fabulous', 'sound', 'great', 'picture.The', 'harmonies', 'Me', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'live', 'band', 'were', '1966', 'were', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', ""'66"", 'also', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'concert', ""'64"", 'comments', 'people', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson.These', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'sought', 'media', '1964.What', 'Beatles', 'fan', 'would', 'care', 'oppinions', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'excited', 'concert', 'footage.It', 'taken', 'one', 'stationary', 'camera', 'stage', 'left', 'only', 'get', 'side', 'view', 'fabs.It', 'still', 'nice', 'however.And', 'best', 'part', 'probably', 'tied', 'Washington', 'footage', 'very', 'last', 'press', 'conference', '1966', 'just', 'Jesus', 'nonsense', 'had', 'died', 'down.You', 'get', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'thing.Note', 'John', 'barely', 'concealed', 'bitterness', 'anger', 'questions.Who', 'could', 'blame', 'what', 'others', 'had', 'been', 'Paul', 'usual', 'adoreable', 'tripping', 'words', 'making', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'comment', 'went', 'quite', 'well.George', 'always', 'gentleman', 'rather', 'banal', 'question', 'grace', 'politeness', 'not', 'hint', 'annoyance.Loved', 'side', 'disk.Fun', 'Fab', 'Four', 'interesting', 'parts', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'many', 'cutaways', 'Beatlemania', 'scenes.This', 'was', 'annoying', 'especially', 'Swedish', 'interview', 'where', 'interviewer', 'Paul', 'What', 'girl', 'good', 'Yes', 'actually', 'poor', 'Paul', 'question', 'Talk', 'being', 'hot', 'seat', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'face', 'answered', 'instead', 'cutaway', 'teenage', 'geek', 'screaming', 'outstretched', 'time', 'back', 'Paul', 'already', 'answered', 'very', 'smooth', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'get', 'see', 'John', 'egging', 'Paul', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'uncomfortable', ""'m"", 'just', 'helping', 'Then', 'cutaway', 'people', 'speaking', 'Swedish', 'showing', 'off', 'stupid', 'Beatle', 'dresses.A', 'lot', 'airport', 'scenes', 'screaming', 'people', 'horn', 'rimmed', 'glasses.Yes', 'get', 'already', 'Beatlemania', 'was', 'quite', 'phenomenon', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'cause', 'most', 'wonderful', 'part', 'side', 'however', 'very', 'long', 'scene', 'Around', 'Beatles', 'TV', 'special', 'aired', 'April', '1964.You', 'will', 'see', 'boys', 'performing', 'hilarious', 'Shakespear', 'comedy', 'sketch', 'complete', 'audience', 'participation', 'shouts', 'encouragement.Paul', 'George', 'shout', 'back', 'too', 'John', 'scream.Their', 'delivery', 'deliberately', 'deadpan', 'send', 'up', 'school', 'play', 'priceless.It', 'worth', 'buying', 'just', 'see', 'sketch', 'course', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'enjoy.Let', 'not', 'forget', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'angry', 'city', 'cop', 'boys', 'violate', 'curfew.Once', 'again', 'Paul', 'hotseat.He', 'caught', 'girl', 'room.I', 'guess', 'really', 'did', 'know', 'what', 'girls', 'good', 'DVD', '105', 'minutes', 'pure', 'joy', 'Beatle', 'fans.You', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Beatles Unauthorized/Fun with the Fab Four

Also, there is no music.Flip the disc over and you've got ""Beatles Unauthorized.""  This program is way better.  It starts off with six songs from the Beatles' 1964 Washington DC concert.  Then there are two songs  from the 1964 Hollywood Bowl concert.  These are both very exciting concerts to watch.  The final portion is an entire, uninterrupted 1966 press conference.
