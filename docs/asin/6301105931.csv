One is Don Quijote. Many people thinks Don Quijote is a madman.But I think no. We see this movie: in a ranch Southwest of the USA, it doesn't rain many times ago. Lizzie Curry is single woman  played by Katharine Hepburn who isn't physically attractive and passes his life in cooking and caring of the house for his father  and two brothers. A life mostly vegetative and a  raw survival.But this is the case, for me, the real madman is his brother Noah Curry. This a very realistic man until the extreme he's brutal, because naked truth can be so,  and does from life a desert without any illusion, killing any desire. Noah is good, but he's blind for life, his reality and truth being deadly and sterile.Then, appears Starbucks, AKA Tornado Johnson, played by Burt Lancaster, a con man, but not a evil one but mostly a dreamer unable to recognize daily reality, but with the marvelous ability to induce hope in the life of others. One is Lizzie. Many people is capable to do daily work, but few to produce hope.Summing up, a good movie that shows life is a very delicate balance, but worthless without hope.

Her father and two brothers are trying their best to get her married off before it's too late, but time is running out, and unfortunately, Hepburn is too serious and not &quot;flirty&quot; enough to be able to land a man.  Into this situation walks Burt Lancaster, a con man who claims that for $100 he can end the drought that is another worry for them.  Everyone knows it is a con, but much like the problem with Hepburn, they hold onto anything that might give them hope.  Lancaster gives a florid performance as the charismatic huckster.  Sometimes he's a little over-ripe, but he definitely leaves an impression.  Hepburn never completely captures her character, although she does have some terrific moments.  Earl Holliman as her rowdy younger brother scores big with this performance, offering some of the films most amusing bits.  The Rainmaker was adapted from a stage play, and you can see its stage origins, where I suspect it probably comes across better.

Take your pick: early-warning tornado devices or cumulous nimbus over drought stricken cattle. It requires more than animated gestures and wild stories to satisfy the matrimonial desires of aging Lizzie Curry (Katherine Hepburn). Their paths cross in the Southwest as THE RAINMAKER promises thunder to the Curry family of hopefuls and hopeless.At 49 - just six years older than Lancaster, Hepburn appears old enough to be mother to her theatrical siblings - a mistaken assumption expressed by daffy brother Jim (Earl Holliman) when he remarks how wonderful it would be for her to conceive a child so he could have a little brother. Nevertheless, the vigorous passion of this Old Maid desiring change without changing well compliments the undesputed Star - buck.

245352,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6301105931,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[13, 16]","On a drought-plagued farm somewhere in the southwest, spinster Lizzy Curry (Katharine Hepburn) has finally given up on ever being married, although her family wants to make one last effort with File (Wendell Corey), the local lawman.  Into their lives comes the fast talking con man Starbuck (Burt Lancaster), who promises that he can make it rain for $100.  More importantly, he can see the con job that Lizzy has played on herself and before he rides out of town he will have redeemed not only the shy spinster but himself.Katharine Hepburn was well into her period of playing spinsters by the time she made this 1956 film with Burt Lancaster. The idea of Hepburn and Lancaster making a film together is interesting since they had totally different approaches to the acting craft.  Hepburn would have the entire script memorized before shooting began whereas Lancaster preferred to learn his lines the night before. This is one of those films where the Bryn Mawr accent of the leading actress works against the character, but then the whole idea of Hepburn playing a rube--with costumes by Edith Head no less--is a bit of a stretch to start.  Lancaster really sinks his teeth into the role of the charming mountebank Starbuck.  Cameron Prud'Homme, Earl Hollliman and Lloyd Bridges play Lizzy's worried father and brothers, and it is they who really give the film its sense of life out on the farm more than the sets and scenery.Based on N. Richard Nash's play, the film was directed by Joseph Anthony, who had directed the stage version starring Geraldine Page (presumably an attempt to duplicate the success of Elia Kazan in moving from Broadway to Hollywood).  The story is still produced by community theaters as the musical &quot;110 in the Shade.&quot;  Hepburn received her seventh Oscar nomination for Best Actress for &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (the winner that year was Ingrid Bergman for &quot;Anastasia&quot;), but the role of Lizzy Curry is not one of best performances.  Certainly Lizzy is becoming desperate, but Hepburn gives those scenes too much of an edge.  In her earlier films this worked quite well, most notably in &quot;Alice Adams,&quot; but in as a mature actress Hepburn was much more successful in underplaying the desperation of her spinster characters, as such did superbly the previous year in &quot;Summertime.&quot;  This may well be one of those regards in which it is simply difficult to separate the actress from the role.  However, in her strongest scenes she certainly brings dignity to the frightened spinster, and in the end you understand why she would actually pick Wendell Corey over Burt Lancaster.",4,One of Katharine Hepburn's Oscar nominated Spinster roles,971481600,"10 14, 2000",2000,2642,"['drought-plagued', 'farm', 'somewhere', 'southwest', 'spinster', 'Lizzy', 'Curry', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'finally', 'given', 'up', 'ever', 'being', 'married', 'family', 'make', 'one', 'last', 'effort', 'File', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'local', 'lawman', 'Into', 'lives', 'fast', 'talking', 'con', 'man', 'Starbuck', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'rain', '100', 'More', 'importantly', 'can', 'see', 'con', 'job', 'Lizzy', 'played', 'town', 'will', 'have', 'redeemed', 'not', 'only', 'shy', 'spinster', 'himself.Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'well', 'period', 'playing', 'spinsters', 'time', 'made', '1956', 'film', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'idea', 'Hepburn', 'Lancaster', 'making', 'film', 'together', 'interesting', 'had', 'totally', 'different', 'approaches', 'acting', 'craft', 'Hepburn', 'would', 'have', 'entire', 'script', 'memorized', 'shooting', 'began', 'whereas', 'Lancaster', 'preferred', 'learn', 'lines', 'night', 'before', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'Bryn', 'Mawr', 'accent', 'leading', 'actress', 'works', 'character', 'then', 'whole', 'idea', 'Hepburn', 'playing', 'rube', 'costumes', 'Edith', 'Head', 'no', 'less', 'bit', 'stretch', 'start', 'Lancaster', 'really', 'teeth', 'role', 'charming', 'mountebank', 'Starbuck', 'Cameron', ""Prud'Homme"", 'Earl', 'Hollliman', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'play', 'Lizzy', 'worried', 'father', 'brothers', 'who', 'really', 'give', 'film', 'sense', 'life', 'farm', 'more', 'sets', 'scenery.Based', 'N.', 'Richard', 'Nash', 'play', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Joseph', 'Anthony', 'who', 'had', 'directed', 'stage', 'version', 'starring', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'presumably', 'attempt', 'duplicate', 'success', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'moving', 'Broadway', 'Hollywood', 'story', 'still', 'produced', 'community', 'theaters', 'musical', 'quot', '110', 'Shade.', 'quot', 'Hepburn', 'received', 'seventh', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'quot', 'Rainmaker', 'quot', 'winner', 'year', 'was', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'quot', 'Anastasia', 'quot', 'role', 'Lizzy', 'Curry', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Certainly', 'Lizzy', 'becoming', 'desperate', 'Hepburn', 'scenes', 'too', 'much', 'edge', 'earlier', 'films', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'most', 'notably', 'quot', 'Alice', 'Adams', 'quot', 'mature', 'actress', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'underplaying', 'desperation', 'spinster', 'characters', 'such', 'did', 'superbly', 'previous', 'year', 'quot', 'Summertime.', 'quot', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'regards', 'simply', 'difficult', 'separate', 'actress', 'role', 'However', 'strongest', 'certainly', 'dignity', 'frightened', 'spinster', 'end', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'actually', 'pick', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'Burt', 'Lancaster']",The Rainmaker VHS

Richard Nash adapted his own work for this perfect screen version of his hit Broadway play, later a musical (110 IN THE SHADE).Directed by Joseph Anthony, the 1956 film tells the story of a ranching family in the drought-stricken American Southwest of the 1930s, and how their lives are changed one night when a travelling con-man comes knocking on their door, offering to bring them rain for one hundred dollars.Burt Lancaster, in what is certainly a warm-up for his Oscar-winning performance in ELMER GANTRY, is superb as the fast-talking con-man who wants nothing more from life than to produce ""one little miracle,"" and Katharine Hepburn is absolutely brilliant as the ""plain"" spinster daughter of the ranching family who does not trust Lancaster, but is, ultimately, won over by his charms.Lloyd Bridges and Earl Holliman play Hepburn's brothers, Cameron Prud'homme is the patriarch of the family and Wendell Corey is cast as the town's deputy sheriff who is smitten with Hepburn, but too frightened to do anything about it.This is a truly charming romantic comedy that has lost none of its luster over the years.

Kate gives a strong performance in both films. However, in ""The Rainmaker"" she has to best the stage presence of Burt Lancaster. Just like he does in ""Elmer Gantry"" Lancaster is a dominating force. When Burt talks... everybody listens. Katherine Hepburn is up to the challenge. As the middle aged unmarried daughter of the land owner who hires the raimaker, Kate is excellent. ( Kate was nominated for an Oscar for her performance.)Sit back and enjoy Hepburn and Lancaster in a fun film from the 1950s.Note: The play, ""The Rainmaker"" was made into a Broadway musical, ""110 in the Shade"".

A part of her is content to remain the way she is--that is until she tastes the magic of the Rainmaker, played by Burt Lancaster.  His very presence on the scene awakens pent up longings.  Burt is perfect in his part, and they are perfect together. The family has paid the traveling rainmaker to produce rain for their crops and livestock.  He chants and raves spouting beautiful oratory in order to conjure up the rain.  When they start to believe that he is just another traveling con man, the thunder starts to roll as his rainmaker wagon is rolling off their ranch.  He earns the money for the rain he promised them, and our old maid will never be the same again.  The rainmaker has taught her something about taking risks during his stay. He has taught her to dare to dream, to believe in miracles.  This is a great movie.

Her acting range is better exhibited in ""The Lion in Winter"" or ""Bringing Up Baby.""  Burt Lancaster also played his charlatan/con man role on other occasions (see Elmer Gantry.)The writing (adapted by the author from his play) was excellent; contrived in plot yes (and remarkably similar to ""The Music Man"" in story), but surprisingly moving, intelligent and even free-thinking for its time--here's a father who encourages his daughter to become a ""fallen woman"". The original play ""The Rainmaker"" was adapted into the lovely musical ""110 in the Shade"" which is currently (June 2007) being revived on Broadway with the fabulous Audra McDonald. The film has comedy of a sort, personal drama, and a scene with Ms Hepburn's Lizzie in which she predicts her old-maid future that brought tears to my eyes. THAT's where her acting shines through.
