Who acts like this?  No one.  No one is going to meet someone for the first time and then say how they broke a child's blanket in half because it was so full of dried semen.  The lines were so over-the-top and ridiculous.Some scenes that could have had anyone on the floor with laughter were not pushed far enough.  The movie wound up just being really cheesy and full of scenes of improvised, badly-acted lines and lame jokes. (the one woman takes about 10 puppies from the bridal shower  -  who cares, it's not funny.The scene where the bride had diarrhea in the street:  you saw nothing but her sitting on the ground.  How was that funny?  Should of had it all over her dress, she could have slipped on it........The point is, you can't try act serious (as with the street crap scene) but then go OVER THE TOP the next minute.

With the cast, you'd think it would be two hours of funny skits brimming with womanly humor. Not so much. Kristen Wiig is one of my favorite snl ladies ever, and while I loved watching her on the big screen, I was severely taken back by the central focus on her character's life story instead of a focus on, crazy me, a wedding. Maybe I went into it unrealistically, expecting something more akin to the female version of the hangover.Don't get me wrong, there are some great moments. I've never witnessed women vomiting all over a bridal shop, nor a bride crapping herself in a street. The love story that ends up stealing the show is adorably cute. I got a great kick out of the jewelry job, considering I was in jewelry for many years. I just feel that if you're going to title a movie Bridesmaids, have it be about being a bridesmaid.

I keep wondering if they watched a different film than the one I saw, because if I were an executive from Kodak, I would have sued the producers for defamation of perfectly good film stock.With the exception of Melissa McCarthy, who was absolutely hilarious as Megan, ""Bridesmaid"" is simply not funny.  It ranks among the worst films I've ever seen in my lifetime - right there with ""Pulp Fiction"" (another movie a lot of people like) and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (another Judd Apatow movie I really wanted to like but can't).  There is absolutely no one in this movie I care for, least of all Kristen Wiig as the relationship-challenged Annie.  I fully understand Annie's predicament - she's trying to compete with Helen (Rose Byrne) to demonstrate how much affection she has for their mutual friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph), the bride-to-be in the movie.  And there's no way Annie can compete, not with Helen holding the financial cards.  I also understand Annie's frustration with life itself.  It's hard to take things in stride when your world is falling apart and others around you are enjoying success, seemingly without doing much at all to earn it.But ""Bridesmaids"", which has so much subtext and room for depth and development and could've been a classic along the lines of ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", devolves into the kind of juvenile humor that has supplanted sharp writing and timing in modern Hollywood.  The food poisoning scene, which many have found funny, revolted me.  I've had food poisoning before.  There's nothing funny about it.  I think there is a place in movies for humor like that, if it's kept within the context of the movie.  For example, in ""Big Momma's House"", there was a scene in which Big Momma had to go because of some prunes she ate.  That was funny because the occassional urgent need to go is an almost universal experience that is relatable, but even more so because Martin Lawrence's character, who was hiding in the bathroom at the time Big Momma let go, was exposed to the aftermath.Even more egregious was that this was the final film for the normally reliable Jill Clayburgh, who I enjoyed watching in movies such as ""First Monday in October"" and ""Silver Streak"".  It's tough to watch a fine actress working in a film with this level of schlock, and Ms. Clayburgh honestly deserved a better sendoff than this.On the whole, ""Bridesmaids"" owes me three stars - one for me sitting through it, one for me writing this review, and one for me not being an executive of Kodak and thus not in a position to sue them for wasting a lot of film that could've been used to make a better movie.",1,An insult to perfectly good film stock that owes ME three stars,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,2678,"['lot', 'people', 'know', 'Bridesmaids', 'keep', 'wondering', 'watched', 'different', 'film', 'one', 'saw', 'were', 'executive', 'Kodak', 'would', 'have', 'sued', 'producers', 'defamation', 'perfectly', 'good', 'film', 'stock.With', 'exception', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Megan', 'Bridesmaid', 'simply', 'not', 'funny', 'worst', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'lifetime', 'right', 'there', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'movie', 'lot', 'people', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'movie', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'one', 'movie', 'care', 'least', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'relationship-challenged', 'Annie', 'fully', 'understand', 'Annie', 'predicament', 'trying', 'compete', 'Helen', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'much', 'affection', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Lillian', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'bride-to-be', 'movie', 'way', 'Annie', 'can', 'compete', 'not', 'Helen', 'holding', 'financial', 'cards', 'also', 'understand', 'Annie', 'frustration', 'life', 'hard', 'take', 'things', 'stride', 'when', 'world', 'falling', 'apart', 'others', 'are', 'enjoying', 'success', 'seemingly', 'doing', 'much', 'earn', 'it.But', 'Bridesmaids', 'so', 'much', 'subtext', 'room', 'depth', 'development', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'classic', 'lines', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'kind', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'supplanted', 'sharp', 'writing', 'timing', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'food', 'poisoning', 'scene', 'many', 'have', 'found', 'funny', 'revolted', ""'ve"", 'had', 'food', 'poisoning', 'before', 'nothing', 'funny', 'think', 'place', 'movies', 'humor', 'kept', 'context', 'movie', 'example', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'was', 'scene', 'Big', 'Momma', 'had', 'go', 'prunes', 'ate', 'was', 'funny', 'occassional', 'urgent', 'need', 'go', 'almost', 'universal', 'experience', 'relatable', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'hiding', 'bathroom', 'time', 'Big', 'Momma', 'let', 'go', 'was', 'exposed', 'aftermath.Even', 'more', 'egregious', 'was', 'was', 'final', 'film', 'normally', 'reliable', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movies', 'such', 'First', 'Monday', 'October', 'Silver', 'Streak', 'tough', 'watch', 'fine', 'actress', 'working', 'film', 'level', 'schlock', 'Ms.', 'Clayburgh', 'honestly', 'deserved', 'better', 'sendoff', 'whole', 'Bridesmaids', 'three', 'stars', 'one', 'sitting', 'one', 'writing', 'review', 'one', 'not', 'being', 'executive', 'Kodak', 'thus', 'not', 'position', 'sue', 'wasting', 'lot', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', 'make', 'better', 'movie']",N/A

OK, here it goes: ""Bridesmaids"" is the funniest movie I've seen (so far) this year!!! This film is just plain hilarious! Don't go thinking this is some female version ofThe Hangover (Extreme Edition). It may have ""Hangover""s raunchy humor but it has a hell of a lot more heart without the simpleDude, Where's My Car?-like plot. Although, appearing from the advertising, this may seem like it's all about the bachelorette party, it's not. The film does not primarily focus on all six girls, but particularly Rudolph (the bride-to-be), Wiig (the maid of honor), and Byrne (the new, rich best friend). Byrne, who is known mostly for drama (FX'sDamages: The Complete Seasons 1-2), does wonders in comedy; to catch her prior comedic performance, check outGet Him to the Greek (Two-Disc Collector's Edition). And Melissa McCarthy shines as Megan, the future sister-in-law, who -- along with Wiig -- owns most of the laughs in the film! Kemper basically plays her other cute, girl-next-door role Erin (from NBC's ""The Office"") but does well at it. McLendon-Covey (Comedy Central's ""Reno 911"") also does well as the mom of three boys who needs to run wild. And Jon Hamm (AMC's ""Mad Men""), who proves that drama is not his only talent, is great as the jerky pretty-boy, booty-call buddy, Ted. But the triumvirate of Wiig, Rudolph and Byrne are the best ones here! Their chemistry truly compliments this film. The movie, co-written by Wiig, not only is hugely humorous, but also speaks to the very reality that is how catty and territorial woman can sometimes be with each other (i.e., when Wiig feels her role as best friend is being taken over by Byrne). The great thing about the film, besides the laughs, is the true message that Wiig's Annie has to learn as things in her life fall apart all around her. She has to step up and learn to respect herself, not feel sorry for herself, and at the same time be sensitive to others. This may sound like a bummer or too deep for a comedy, but the film pulls it all off without being pretentious or too deep.Both Wiig and Rudolph have shined in previous roles and proved their acting chops -- Wiig inWhip Itand Rudolph inAway We Go. Their friendship in the movie is what overall sells the story. And Wiig's blooming romance with Irish policeman Officer Rhodes (a likeable everyman Chris O'Dowd) does not get in the way of the overall story nor distract from it. If anything, it helps it along and I applaud writers Wiig and Annie Mumolo (who has a cameo as Wiig's neurotic flight co-passenger) for correctly balancing it all without a hitch, and a special shout-out to producer Judd Apatow and director Paul Feig (creator of ""Freaks and Geeks"") for having the wisdom to take on the story. This film attempts what I believe writer Nancy Pimental was trying to do when she wrote the 2002 Cameron Diaz stinker,The Sweetest Thing (Unrated Edition). Pimental was attempting to incorporate the gross-out humor of male comedy films such as ""Knocked Up,"" but also trying to make a touching female-bonding film. In my mind, Pimental, the director (Roger Kumble) and cast all failed. The film came off to me like some pathetic attempt at making women too much like guys. However, ""Bridesmaids"" balances the raunchy with the endearing with great success!This film works for both sexes: women will LOVE to view it with girlfriends and men will love it for not having to roll their eyes! That's how downright funny and enjoyable this film is! The only thing I have to warn you about is that you may have to see it a second time just to catch the funny lines you missed from you (and the audience) laughing so loud and hard.",5,"The best comedy of the year!

1386587,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00466HN7M,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Kristen Wiig is a comedic goldmine.  She just knows how to milk `funny' out of any and everything.  The fact that she wrote this screenplay is testament to that fact.  What it is also testament to is that she understands the importance of layering her comedy with drama, and by drama I don't mean your textbook drama of the theatrical kind (although some of that is here too) but what I mean is genuine, heartfelt drama of the almost bitter-sweet kind.  There is a sadness here that meshes beautifully with those `funny moments'.`Bridesmaids', which was marketed as a `Hangover' for chicks (complete with focus on a Las Vegas bachelorette party) is anything but a rehashing of that successful 2009 comedy.  Instead, Las Vegas is a minor scene that doesn't even really happen and so the focus of that event in the trailer was an obvious misleading of audiences, but it was a twist I was so happy to embrace because last thing I wanted to see was this turn into `Hangover' redux.  Instead, `Bridesmaids' tells the story of a Maid of Honor trying to get a grip on her own thankless life while trying to support her best friend, who happens to be getting married.  Annie is so lonely and pathetic and depressed and yet Lillian is glowing with marital happiness.  When Annie meets Helen, Lillian's `other' best friend, a rivalry is born for Lillian's affections and attention and soon the crazy is unleashed in various forms.`Bridesmaids' primary problem is that it doesn't know when to call it a day.  It is probably about twenty minutes too long.  That isn't to say that there is a lot of fluff here, because there really isn't and the more mellow moments (especially concerning Annie's budding romance with traffic cop Rhodes) are needed in developing the film as a whole, but it really should have been trimmed back.The performances are all wonderful.  Wiig is flawless here, truly developing her character beyond the comedic timing.  Just watch her face as she hears about Lillian's engagement.  There is such sadness behind those eyes, such depth of character.  You can see her telling her story without uttering a single word.  Rose Byrne should probably stick to comedy forever since she isn't having much luck with the drama side of things and her performance here is the highlight of her career (she was also lovely in her jovial scenes in `Marie Antoinette').  She is totally on her A-game and delivers some of the film's funniest moments.And I just love Chris O'Dowd!In the end, `Bridesmaids' is a great little film.  It is funny and charming and sincere, which is a hard combination to come by these days, especially in this genre.

I did not see this in the theater and was filled with anticipation to watch the blu ray.  I love most of the women here and was not let down at all.  Funny though, after all the hype, it was not anything what I expected.  The comparison to THE HANGOVER?  This film involves a roadtrip but differs greatly for it is a comedy with heart.  Kristen Wiig is the true headliner here and she carries this film from beginning to end.  She provides many of the greatest laughs but her character also provides the true heart and emotion to this film.  Yes, it is a laughfest comedy with humor that is sometimes a little gross but under all that is a heartfelt story.  Maya Rudolph also provides heart to this film.  For the comedic part of the film the greatest performance is given by Melissa McCarthy.  This is a huge breakout performance for her.  If you aren't too happy after your first viewing of this film I highly suggest ginving it another viewing without expectation.  You will then see the many layers that make this film a huge success.The blu ray comes with the theatrical version as well as the unrated version.  The video is amazing and colors pop while fleshtones are realistic and lovely.  Black/white ration is excellent and the picture just jumps off the screen with a vibrant crispness.  And the clarity shows every detail in every frame to great detail.  The audio is also excellent.  Dialogue is always present and clear and when music comes the surround speakers are put to great use.  This film honestly shows blu ray at its best.  And the blu ray edition also has hours of amazing extras that are not on the dvds.  I highly recommend this film.  It is an amazing comedy with an all female cast that will have you in stitches.

E Jackson,"[1, 3]","As a guy, it's definitely not cool to watch a movie that goes by the name ""Bridesmaids"" but, to my total amazement, the GREAT news is that, not only is the humor intended for *both* guys and girls, but it actually hardly focuses on the wedding itself (until the very end, other than a quick party segment in the middle).Bridesmaids seriously had several really well-written and laugh out loud segments that never irritate nor feel tacky either.  The storyline focuses around the blonde-haired woman played by Kristen Wiig who stars is many adventures, or rather, MISadventures, haha.  She meets a cop and they fall in love but... well, I wouldn't be so quick to call this ""love"".  More like the cop falls for her but she's too afraid to make an impression when the relationship tries to take a serious turn.  That's one of many elements to this puzzling relationship.SEVERAL of the laughs come when Kristen's character meets up with all her friends and they unintentionally find themselves caught in situations where things go horribly wrong.  To give a few examples, in one scene they all go out to eat together at a restaurant and afterwards while shopping for wedding clothes, they become violently sick.  This leads to a scene that's best not to spoil not only for the surprise factor, but for the appropriateness of the matter, haha.  You'll CERTAINLY know what I mean when you see how disgusting this particular bathroom segment is!  Another hilarious segment comes during the plane ride when the blonde woman takes drugs and gives the steward and stewardess a hard time.  I like this plane segment in particular for the many layers of depth between ALL the characters.  Many of these jokes qualify as humor done in a subtle way, but it works beautifully.The storyline is SO well-written in fact, that it manages to keep your attention the entire way through.  The writers did a good job coming up with a script that both men and women can enjoy together, however I do believe some of the jokes are a little too offensive for women (such as one scene where a woman explains how dirty boys become when they reach their teenage years- she doesn't hold anything back).Other than that, expect a quality storyline, lots of laughs, and well, how can we forget the one woman of the bunch who's rock solid both physically and attitude-wise?  She's actually tied with Kristen Wiig's character for most exciting actress of the group.  All the characters in the film end up fitting the role perfectly as the story unravels.

That's giving it little to surpass in my book, but I will give it that much. But it was still like watching a typical Saturday Night Live character for more than a typical skit length, which alone can be uncomfortable in watching and getting past the typical delivery, which Kristin Wig's got down to a science. There's the now expected &#34;gut busting&#34; scenes that are now so wide reaching in their urge to be raunchy that they're cliched and unfunny, such as the bridal gown fitting scene. That's pretty par for the course of a SNL product's desperate need to reach for its chuckles. Melissa McCarthy is the obligatory misfit which evoked not nare a chuckle from me, as I can see she was designed to. And the mix of varying characters for clashing personality works as it's done pretty much the other million times I've seen it. Only here, at a much more drawn out SNL skit pace that wore itself out the first 15 minutes. However, where I don't find Wig as funny as others seem to, she did evoke a certain heart throughout the movie that keeps it above water enough to separate if from some of its contemporaries. These movies will always have an audience. They're packaged visually and audibly in the manner that is standard quality for flicks of this genre. And many will also go see it because of SNL brand loyalty, or following the actors involved, or obligatory need to see the current hottest flicks. And the box office on that basis will show it's a successful movie. Me, I'm glad I'm no longer dating a girl where I'd have to see crap like this to prove how much I cared. And it took me almost of year of having it DVRd before I was able to finally sit through it all. Kristin Wig is too SNL assembly line for my taste-her pace, inflections delivery, etc.  But hey, I made the effort to watch it on my own to prove I'm not averse to contemporary comedies, much less movies in general.

She behaves intolerably towards the very giving new friend in her supposed best friend's life and then has everyone bending over backwards at the end of the movie to either apologise to her for THEIR behaviour or forgive her for hers.

It's not -- at all -- which is unfortunate.It's actually a movie about Kristen Wiig's character, with Maya Rudolph and Rose Byrne there to drive the plot, a couple of funny scenes from Melissa McCarthy, and next to nothing with the other two bridesmaids, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper.  Jon Hamm is pretty funny, and Chris O'Dowd is an appealing romantic interest, but overall, there just isn't enough entertainment in this movie to justify the runtime of over 2 hours.The central conflict is a classic love triangle, with the poor protagonist competing against a rich rival.  The twist here is that all three characters are women, and it's a friendship relationship rather than a romantic one at stake.  That's fine, I guess, except that while I understand romantic relationships need to be exclusive, I spent this entire movie wondering why they don't just all be friends.  Maybe it's because I'm a guy, but if some rich guy started buying a bunch of expensive gifts for my best friend, I can't imagine that my reaction would be open and public outrage. (To be fair, my fiancee didn't like this movie either.)To the movie's credit, it doesn't paint Wiig's character as the blameless heroine in this situation, and it does show some amount of emotional intelligence.  The main reason I didn't like it is that all the comedy set pieces (and they are very much self-contained little units rather than organic outflows of character and situation) have the feel of mediocre SNL sketches: amusing at first, occasionally outright funny, and then they overstay their welcome by 3 to 5 minutes apiece.",2,Badly in need of editing,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,1703,"['was', 'expecting', 'be', 'ensemble', 'comedy', 'something', 'female', 'version', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'not', 'unfortunate.It', 'actually', 'movie', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'character', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'drive', 'plot', 'couple', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'next', 'nothing', 'other', 'two', 'bridesmaids', 'Wendi', 'McLendon-Covey', 'Ellie', 'Kemper', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'appealing', 'romantic', 'interest', 'overall', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'justify', 'runtime', '2', 'hours.The', 'central', 'conflict', 'classic', 'love', 'triangle', 'poor', 'protagonist', 'competing', 'rich', 'rival', 'twist', 'here', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'women', 'friendship', 'relationship', 'rather', 'romantic', 'one', 'stake', 'fine', 'guess', 'understand', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'need', 'be', 'exclusive', 'spent', 'entire', 'movie', 'wondering', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'all', 'be', 'friends', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'guy', 'rich', 'guy', 'started', 'buying', 'bunch', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'best', 'friend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'reaction', 'would', 'be', 'open', 'public', 'outrage', 'be', 'fair', 'fiancee', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'either', 'movie', 'credit', ""n't"", 'paint', 'Wiig', 'character', 'blameless', 'heroine', 'situation', 'show', 'amount', 'emotional', 'intelligence', 'main', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'comedy', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'self-contained', 'little', 'units', 'rather', 'organic', 'outflows', 'character', 'situation', 'have', 'feel', 'mediocre', 'SNL', 'sketches', 'amusing', 'first', 'occasionally', 'outright', 'funny', 'then', 'overstay', 'welcome', '3', '5', 'minutes', 'apiece']",N/A

1386651,A3KZLC8UFCQ8NU,B00466HN7M,cherryblueberry,"[4, 4]","This movie was semi-funny....hence the 3 stars.  HOWEVER....I feel so much of this movie was way too &#34;over-the-top&#34;...like the writers just wanted to shock and gross out, as opposed to crafting a more sophisticated in-depth comedy about two friends.  Wait a minute, that's it...that's what's been bothering me about this movie...it's not at all SOPHISTICATED!  It's more like a gross-out movie for men - geared for women.I wanted to like Bridesmaids.  After all, it's a chick-flick and I am a chick.  In the movie, Kristen Wiig is best friends with the bride-to-be, and is chosen to be the maid of honor at her wedding.  Enter Helen, a woman who is also friends with the bride-to-be....a smug superior &#34;perfect&#34; women who is going to wreak havoc on Kristen Wiig's already beaten down character's life.  Helen is there to take over all the bridesmaid &#34;duties.&#34;  She is also there to take over the duty of &#34;best friend&#34; to the bride.Before long, the bride-to-be (played by Maya Rudolph) is bonding with Helen ten times more than she is bonding with Kristen Wiig's character.So sets up a huge female rivalry...the basis for the movie.There are also other colorful characters, such as the pack of bridesmaids......all very different from each other....one is quite nave, another is very manly, and still another is sick and tired of her kids and ready to have some ........in her face at a bachelorette party in Vegas (fill in the blank)!Okay, Kristen Wiigs character:  She's insecure, in a nutshell...still reeling after the failure of her bakery (Cake Baby)....and in a bad relationship with a jerk who is only using her.Now let's talk about the actress Kristen Wiig...she is very funny.  She can take a scene and play it out in such a way that it leaves you in hysterics.  She's quirky and likable....not the usual leading lady these days...not trashy or clich&eacute;.  She is unique, which is definitely a plus for this movie.I liked the first half of this movie way better than the second half.  After a while, the movie did seem to drag on a bit.  WARNING:  without giving anything away, there is a really, REALLY gross scene in this movie....my husband liked it.  In fact, he was annoyed about being forced to watch a &#34;chick flick&#34;...then ended up enjoying the movie more than me!So what's my final word on Bridesmaids?  I'm still not sure!  On the plus side, there are definitely funny parts to this movie....there is also some character development and actual real emotion tossed in here and there...the cop is cute (thought I'd add that!)....on the minus side, though, I think they were going too much for &#34;over-the top&#34; shock value at points instead of developing the characters more and creating funny dialogue.But....if you just want to be entertained and not have to use your brain for awhile...go for it!  Bridesmaids is perfect to just pop in and veg out to...just don't expect to laugh and feel the emotions like you did in Bridgette Jones Diary...or even He's Not that Into You.  They do try to manipulate you into &#34;feeling emotion&#34; at the end of the movie, but it seems a bit forced and fake to me at that point.However, I am rambling.  Just watch the movie...be entertained....and include your husband or boyfriend.

Her newest friend (Rose Byrne), a type-A who organizes everyone's parties/lives, appears to be stealing away affection from Annie who starts to go slowly mad. Annie's life hasn't been in the best of shape anyhow since she lost her business, lost all her money, lost her job and her apartment. Having this added stress on top of it doesn't make things easier and though she eventually gets a new boyfriend in the form of an Irish immigrant cop (Chris O'Dowd), her life remains chaotic and unhappy. Mind you, this is a comedy.And for the most part, it's a very funny! It's rude and crude in parts (particularly in a scene in a bridal shop), but those parts are funny, so I'm fine with that. I will say the movie starts off very strong, sags significantly in the middle (the airplane scene went on way too long), and recovers somewhat in the end. There's still some laughs in the later parts, but the first portion of the movie is where most of the fun is to be had. I will also say that the first part is strong enough to make up for the sagging parts in the middle.This isn't a perfect movie, but it is fun and it is worth seeing. Hopefully it will be the start of a trend where people write good comedy films about women and their relationships, much as they have with men. This movie stands well on its own, but if it's the start of something bigger, I'll be quite pleased.",4,Lots of good laughs and some decent emotion,1305417600,"05 15, 2011",2011,1788,"['so', 'masses', 'cried', 'out', 'Where', 'twenty-something', 'gross-out', 'comedy', 'women', 'lo', 'gods', 'cinema', 'did', 'smile', 'outpoured', 'Bridesmaids', 'latest', 'effort', 'producer', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'genius', 'mind', 'such', 'films', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'Annie', 'Kristian', 'Wiig', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'best', 'friend', 'Lillian', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'get', 'married', 'newest', 'friend', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'type-A', 'who', 'everyone', 'parties/lives', 'be', 'stealing', 'away', 'affection', 'Annie', 'who', 'go', 'slowly', 'mad', 'Annie', 'life', ""n't"", 'been', 'best', 'shape', 'anyhow', 'lost', 'business', 'lost', 'money', 'lost', 'job', 'apartment', 'Having', 'added', 'stress', 'top', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'eventually', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'form', 'Irish', 'immigrant', 'cop', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'life', 'chaotic', 'unhappy', 'Mind', 'comedy.And', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'funny', 'rude', 'crude', 'parts', 'particularly', 'scene', 'bridal', 'shop', 'parts', 'are', 'funny', ""'m"", 'fine', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'off', 'very', 'strong', 'sags', 'significantly', 'middle', 'airplane', 'scene', 'went', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'recovers', 'somewhat', 'end', 'still', 'laughs', 'later', 'parts', 'first', 'portion', 'movie', 'where', 'most', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'first', 'part', 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'sagging', 'parts', 'middle.This', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'movie', 'fun', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'start', 'trend', 'where', 'people', 'write', 'good', 'comedy', 'films', 'women', 'relationships', 'much', 'have', 'men', 'movie', 'well', 'own', 'start', 'something', 'bigger', ""'ll"", 'be', 'quite', 'pleased']",N/A

Messina,"[1, 2]","I literally laughed aloud for most of the movie and haven't laughed that hard since I saw 'Tommy Boy' for the first time way back when.Brides Maids is a funny movie that really breaks the mold. In fact, I didn't want to watch it because of the title alone, as much as I've always liked Wiig. The title is reminicent of all those wedding related 'comedies' we've seen before: Best Friend's Wedding, 27 Dresses, and on and on. But the fact of the matter this really isn't a wedding movie at all (thank heavens). the wedding is just a vehicle to show the interaction between two good friends and all the craziness between them that makes a woman's life an intricate thing.Brides Maids is funny on several levels, which probably explains its' broad appeal. There's the easy gross out humor (the food poisoning scenes are painfully funny) but then there are subtle things like Wiigs' car (could a crappier car be found?), her failed cake store renamed by vandals (baby c*k s) and driving 'exposed' (but not completely) that show how much thought went into every sight gag, every line and every setup/punchline. What makes it better is that it's an ensemble piece where every actor hits it out of the park every time.

1386672,A1JUF6RWAIAFY1,B00466HN7M,Cool Breeze,"[5, 9]","The last time I watched a movie with female protagonists that stayed with me was 'Kill Bill'. I love 'Kill Bill'. I think that I may have watched both of the 'Kill Bill' movies at least 50 times each, and when basic cable plays a rerun of the 'Kill Bill' movies, I always make it a point to tune in. There is so much going on in the 'Kill Bill' movies.  There are themes of adventure, action, romance, violence and revenge; and what makes 'Kill Bill' so enthralling is that all of the female protagonists who populate this movie are expertly used by Tarantino to explore the above stated themes. I have seen many movies that use male leads to flesh out characters in action movies, and because males have been used so many times in this genre of films, watching them has become sort of redundant. But watching 'Kill Bill' for the first time was a revelatory experience, because for the first time in my life I was watching an American action revenge film that exhibited a woman experiencing the feelings associated with adventure, action, romance, violence, and revenge.  Some people may say that 'Kill Bill' was not a revolutionary film, as there were many Asian films that came before 'Kill Bill' in which a strong female protagonist was required to fulfill the requirements of an action heroine who was expertly skilled in martial arts. But 'Kill Bill' was a revolutionary film because pretty American actresses were inhabiting roles that were usually reserved for Asian female actresses in China, Korea, and Japan.A woman who excels in the role of a martial arts action hero means a lot more to me than a male who excels in the same role. Maybe its a little bit sexist, but when a woman uses her martial arts skill to eradicate an enemy it sets of something inside me. In American film and television, there are few roles for women that allow them to kick ass while navigating the emotional ups and downs of the lives of these women. Aside from the Beatrix Kiddo character in 'Kill Bill', the only other female action hero themed movie or television show I know of is 'Nikita'. Beatrix Kiddo and the lady from 'Nikita' have showed everyone that a female martial arts hero can be more effective than a male in the same genre if the show is done right.Effective female driven raunch comedies are also few in number. I cannot recall any from memory. Most of the female driven comedies that have saturated our culture are romantic comedies, and all of them have sucked over the years. As a result, female driven comedic movies had become somewhat of an anathema to me. No matter who has been cast in these female comedies, I've made it a point to avoid all of them. So when the commercials for 'Bridesmaids' started to air on television, I was very skeptical.  But as the time for the release of the movie inched closer, I began to pay attention to all of the reviews on rottentomatoes.com. Most of these reviews were stellar, and the disappointment that was 'Thor' finally pushed me over the edge to 'Bridesmaids'. I watched the movie today, and I am so glad I did.Many people want to compare 'Bridesmaids' to the 'Hangover', but these are very different films.  Although 'Hangover' is a film that is ostensibly about friendship, its premise is built upon debauchery. 'Bridesmaids' is not a film that focuses on debauchery. There are plenty of gross out moments in 'Bridesmaids', but they are just moments.  Unlike the guys in 'Hangover', these women do not travel to a city where they drink themselves into oblivion. Nope. This movie examines the lifelong relationship between two women, Lilian(played by Maya Rudolph)and Annie(played by Kristen Wiig)whose once strong friendship is threatened by a new character(played by Rose Byrne) as the wedding of Lilian approaches.Kristen Whig's character is suffering through a life crisis. She dates a man(played by John Hamm)who affectionately refers to Kristen Wiig's character as his number three; her baking business failed and she is without job; she lives with her mother; her car is broken down; and her friendship with Mya Rudolph's character is threatened by Rose Byrne's character.  All of these problems make Kristen Whig's character lose her mind at the bridal shower, and her already fracturing relationship with her best friend is nearly pulled asunder.With the help of a friendly police offer and and a hilarious bridesmaid(played by Melissa McCarthy), Annie is able to overcome her existential crisis and become a better and stronger person.All of the principle actresses in the movie are wonderful in their roles, especially Melissa McCarthy. She is really, really damn funny in this movie. Kristen Wiig's and Maya Rudolph's performances in the film convince the movie goer of the plausibility of their friendship, and Rose Bryne is really good as the conniving new 'friend'.Now, although this is a movie that features a female cast, everyone who has the pleasure of watching this film will be able to relate to the characters. And fellas, let me tell you this: if you choose to attend this movie, you will laugh out loud with the audience. Also, if you take your girlfriend with you she will definitely like and respect you a great deal more.",5,A Chick Flick for Everyone,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,5204,"['last', 'time', 'watched',

My wife swore up and down that all her friends said it was so wonderful and maybe it was just a woman's point of view that was needed.

The was a reference to the movie ""Castaway"" in this movie and my wife said, ""Talk about a slow, boring movie."" To which I replied, ""At least it is not as slow as this movie."" And my wife said, ""You are right. At least in that movie you expect it to be slow."" So we finished the whole long torturous movie and at the very end my wife say, ""Do you think you can make some of your money back by selling it on Amazon.com while it is still new. I will never watch that again and I am sorry for making you sit through that."" There is only about two funny lines in this whole movie. There was nothing that actually made me laugh, the most I did was smile at the funny stuff. It was just bad. Badly written and directed.

1386677,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B00466HN7M,Crystal Starr Light,"[1, 3]","I finished watching ""Bridesmaids"" last night, and if you were to ask me then if I would review this movie, I probably would have said, ""No"".  But even 24 hours after watching, I find myself still thinking about the themes and messages in ""Bridesmaids"" and am compelled to share this.NOTE: Possible spoilers!!""Bridesmaids"" is the story of Annie, a woman who has apparently hit rock-bottom.  She lost her bakery shop and is forced to take a boring job as a jewelry sales clerk, meanwhile living with two crazy youngsters and being literally and figuratively ""screwed"" by her hot f-buddy, Ted.  Her childhood and best friend, Lilian, is getting married and this unleashes a whole new world of pain for Annie.I got the impression, from trailers and rumors, that this would be a rip-roaring, laugh-out-loud, gut-splitting comedy about the bridesmaids in a wedding.  Maybe for some it is (particularly if those ""some"" don't mind bathroom or obscene humor), but what stuck with me more was the message.Annie lives a lackluster life and does nothing to help herself.  Instead, she wallows in self-pity, complaining and offloading to her long-suffering friend.  When Lilian gets engaged to Dougie, Annie begins to realize that she is, in a way, losing her friend.  At the engagement party, she meets yet another competition for Lilian's attention, the over-achieving, attention-seeking, super-organized Helen, wife of Dougie's boss.  Annie immediately becomes jealous of Helen and thus begins her descent to truly ""rock bottom"".I am struck most by how much Annie is ""every woman/man"".  Who hasn't wallowed in self-pity, stayed in a dead-end job, kept being around people who take advantage of you?  Annie's journey in this movie--from clawing to keep Lilian's slackening attention on her to self-annihilating her relationship with an amazing, caring guy in the form of Officer Nathan Rhodes--is one we can all relate to.This movie was billed as a goofy comedy centering around bridesmaids, but really, that isn't the story we see here.  The actual bridesmaids make far too few appearances (and in the case of Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper, it is truly a shame--I would have loved to have seen more about both women).  The humor ranges from witty and sharp to bathroom humor to obscene, with some jokes (such as the Annie-Helen vying to out-speech each other at Lilian's engagement party and the scene where Annie attempts to get Officer Rhodes attention by driving by doing various illegal things) going on far too long (no one seriously thought to take the microphone away from Annie or Helen?  How much time did Annie waste trying to get Officer Rhodes attention when she could have been scouring likely places for Lilian?).Some people say this movie makes it seem like Annie's life only improves when a man enters her life.  For once, I would like to counter that.  Annie's life does not get better upon meeting Rhodes; it is only when she is faced with a friend, in what I consider to be the best scene in the movie, does her life turn around.To elaborate: Annie, unemployed and homeless, is wasting away in her mother's house, watching ""Castaways"".  Megan, played to perfection by Melissa McCarthy, enters and chastises Annie for not answering Megan's calls.  Annie starts to whine about her life and not having friends when Megan counters (paraphrased), ""You are whining about not having friends, but here I am.""  Megan then begins to poke and prod and wrestle with Annie, trying to get Annie to fight back and stop taking her crappy life, until Annie finally gets annoyed and slaps back.  It is at this moment that Annie's life begins to turn around; not when she meets Rhodes, not when they consummate their relationship, but when a friend forces Annie to take a good long look at her life and decide to fight back.While Annie was a relatable ""every woman/man"", I still found her obnoxious (or perhaps that is me finding my inner wimp obnoxious).  Lilian was a good friend, but even she had her trigger-point and didn't let Annie get away with all her stupid antics.  Megan was one of the best aspects of the movie; sure, her humor tended to be crude and obscene, but, as I said above, her scene with Annie was the best in the movie.  I was most impressed with Helen; our protagonist assumes Helen is just a rich biotch, but Helen isn't.  She is married to a man who is rarely with her, living with her step-children who yell profanities at her.  She has no female friends--possibly because other woman of her class are so backbiting, possibly because woman are intimidated by her beauty or annoyed by her Martha Stewart perfection.  The only woman to be able to tolerate her even minutely is Lilian.  (Of course, self-centered Annie cannot see this at the beginning of the movie.)  Officer Rhodes is a great guy who has been stereotyped by Annie's bad relations with men.  Ted seems abnormally insensitive (calling Annie a ""f-buddy"" in front of a cop when he goes to pick her up off the side of the road seems a little, um, rude), but sometimes things have to be super-obvious in order for us to see them.The naming of this movie seems rather peculiar, as it deals more with the maid of honor and her troubles than the bridesmaids as a whole.  Perhaps ""Maid of Honor"" was too long or too close to another movie, which is why ""Bridesmaids"" was chosen instead.I know I've been long-winded and rambling, so I'll wrap up.  ""Bridesmaids"" is truly a thought-provoking movie, something I hadn't expected.  Instead of busting a gut over some crazy joke, I found myself thinking more and more about life and friends and self-respect.  This movie won't be for everyone--Annie can be obnoxious, the humor isn't for everyone--but for those that don't mind the caveats, there is a really intriguing movie to be found.Brought to you by:*C.S.

1386678,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00466HN7M,C. Sawin,"[7, 16]","I'm not the biggest Judd Apatow fan, but I do consider his films entertaining. A good majority of the films produced under the Apatow Productions moniker are more than a little amusing, as well. In fact, I'm partial to both Anchorman and Pineapple Express. Despite Apatow's involvement with the film, Bridesmaids didn't really interest me all that much in concept. Another R-rated comedy revolving around a wedding with a mostly female cast? Who cares? The underestimation on my part probably helped the film more than anything as Bridesmaids turned out to be an adult comedy with a little more meat on its bones than the trailers perhaps lead you to believe.While the film is both filthy and raunchy at times, the foundation of Bridesmaids lies within the relationship between Annie and Lillian. Their chemistry along with the way they both screw up their lives when they're away from one another is the heart and soul of the film. Lillian's marriage falling apart is kind of a given just with how eccentric each character in the main cast is, but Annie's depression, downward spiral, and inability to drive herself forward rather than continuously pushing herself back is key to giving the film an emotional kick that isn't even hinted at in the trailers. Melissa McCarthy steals nearly every scene that she's in thanks to her outrageous antics and incredibly high self esteem. Nearly every one of the bridesmaids gets a good laugh at some point in the film even if a few of them (Reno! 911's Wendi McLendon-Covey and The Office's Ellie Kemper) don't get as much screen time as others.Bridesmaids almost felt like it was stronger during its more dramatic and softhearted sequences in comparison to the overall comedic atmosphere of the rest of the film, which is weird since it is absolutely a comedy. While the obscene and sometimes scatological jokes used in the film were mostly original in execution and chuckle-worthy at times, it somehow all just felt very familiar to me. The Brazilian food that gave them all food poisoning felt like it borrowed heavily from Dumb & Dumber, the Wilson Phillips joke was funnier in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, while most of the scenes on the airplane seemed to offer a female version of a scene straight out of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles with more profanity. Then there's the film itself which was like Wedding Crashers if seen through the eyes of the women in the actual wedding. I guess on one hand, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. All of those comedies are rather exceptional while at least two of them would be considered classics, but that sense of familiarity was still there like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu sneaking up behind you and trying to tickle you while spewing a constant string of F-bombs.Bridesmaids is a dirty, vulgar, over the top comedy that attempts to affect your limits of compassion just as much as the extent of your hilarity. While some of the gross-out humor came off as a little much at times, Kristen Wiig is able to prove just how talented she really is. It is at least able to offer an R-rated comedy that both sexes will enjoy, which is more that can be said for most PG-13 romantic comedies. Bridesmaids is an entertaining stumble into borderline comedic genius that will keep people talking about it long after it's relevant.",3,A somewhat tender film that pushes the boundaries of comedy,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",2011,3312,"[""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'fan', 'do', 'consider', 'films', 'entertaining', 'good', 'majority', 'films', 'produced', 'Apatow', 'Productions', 'moniker', 'are', 'more', 'little', 'amusing', 'as', 'well', 'fact', ""'m"", 'partial', 'Anchorman', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'Apatow', 'involvement', 'film', 'Bridesmaids', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'interest', 'that', 'much', 'concept', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'revolving', 'wedding', 'mostly', 'female', 'cast', 'Who', 'underestimation', 'part', 'probably', 'helped', 'film', 'more', 'anything', 'Bridesmaids', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'adult', 'comedy', 'little', 'more', 'meat', 'bones', 'trailers', 'perhaps', 'lead', 'believe.While', 'film', 'filthy', 'raunchy', 'times', 'foundation', 'Bridesmaids', 'relationship', 'Annie', 'Lillian', 'chemistry', 'way', 'screw', 'up', 'lives', 'when', ""'re"", 'away', 'one', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'Lillian', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'kind', 'given', 'just', 'how', 'eccentric', 'character', 'main', 'cast', 'Annie', 'depression', 'downward', 'spiral', 'inability', 'drive', 'forward', 'rather', 'continuously', 'pushing', 'back', 'key', 'giving', 'film', 'emotional', 'kick', ""n't"", 'even', 'hinted', 'trailers', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'steals', 'nearly', 'scene', 'thanks', 'outrageous', 'antics', 'incredibly', 'high', 'self', 'esteem', 'Nearly', 'one', 'bridesmaids', 'good', 'laugh', 'point', 'film', 'even', 'few', 'Reno', '911', 'Wendi', 'McLendon-Covey', 'Office', 'Ellie', 'Kemper', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'others.Bridesmaids', 'almost', 'felt', 'was', 'stronger', 'more', 'dramatic', 'softhearted', 'sequences', 'comparison', 'overall', 'comedic', 'atmosphere', 'rest', 'film', 'weird', 'absolutely', 'comedy', 'obscene', 'sometimes', 'scatological', 'jokes', 'used', 'film', 'were', 'mostly', 'original', 'execution', 'chuckle-worthy', 'times', 'somehow', 'just', 'felt', 'very', 'familiar', 'Brazilian', 'food', 'gave', 'food', 'poisoning', 'felt', 'borrowed', 'heavily', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Wilson', 'Phillips', 'joke', 'was', 'funnier', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'Go', 'White', 'Castle', 'most', 'scenes', 'airplane', 'seemed', 'offer', 'female', 'version', 'scene', 'straight', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'more', 'profanity', 'Then', 'film', 'was', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'seen', 'eyes', 'women', 'actual', 'wedding', 'guess', 'one', 'hand', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'comedies', 'are', 'rather', 'exceptional', 'while', 'least', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'classics', 'sense', 'familiarity', 'was', 'still', 'D', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'sneaking', 'up', 'trying', 'tickle', 'spewing', 'constant', 'string', 'F-bombs.Bridesmaids', 'dirty', 'vulgar', 'top', 'comedy', 'affect', 'limits', 'compassion', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'extent', 'hilarity', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'came', 'off', 'little', 'much', 'times', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'able', 'prove', 'just', 'how', 'talented', 'really', 'least', 'able', 'offer', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'sexes', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'most', 'PG-13', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Bridesmaids', 'entertaining', 'stumble', 'borderline', 'comedic', 'genius', 'will', 'keep', 'people', 'talking', 'long', 'relevant']",N/A

1386680,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00466HN7M,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 2]","TV's Saturday Night Live has long been a proving ground for some of the top comedians who have often gone on to greater fame.  Witness John Belushi (Animal House), Eddie Murphy (Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places), Bill Murray (Ghostbusters, Stripes), Will Ferrell (Anchorman), and Tina Fey (30 Rock) among many.  Certainly a few have failed in films like Deuce Bigelow, The Ladies Man, and MacGruber.  Current female SNL player, Kristen Wiig, joins the ranks of the former with Bridesmaids, an occasionally gross, yet heartfelt tale of self worth and ultimately love.  After numerous supporting roles in popular films like Adventureland and Whip It, she has made the big leap into stardom, and she co-wrote the screenplay too!Annie (Wiig) is an insecure, single woman working a miserable job at a jewelry store and whose love life consists of impersonal sexual romps with a narcissistic playboy (Jon Hamm).  Her dreams of a bakery having failed recently, she has horrible roommates and a doting mother (Jill Clayburgh) nearby.  When her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and asks her to be her bridesmaid, Annie prepares the female bridal party for gowns, showers, and the reception.  When Lillian's wealthy, `perfect' friend, Helen (Rose Byrne), elbows her way for attention and begins to take over the wedding preparations, Annie becomes jealous and overdoes things in a display of one-upsmanship (or rather womanship).  In a series of confrontational events, Annie sinks further into verbal ineptitude and embarrassment in front of her best friend.  Along the way she gets pulled over by an Irish cop, Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), who takes a fancy to her; what puzzles her is why any man would be nice to her?  It all culminates at a pre-wedding reception where Annie unleashes her anger and frustration. Things get worse for her at work and her apartment, and as her world comes crashing down and she becomes an outsider to her best friend's wedding, Annie's fate takes a dramatic turn amid friendship and love.Audiences have been well aware of Wiig's physical and whimsical skills as a skit comedienne.  What this film does is show an entirely different spectrum of her abilities as an actress and writer (with Annie Mumolo directed by Paul Feig).  By playing a sympathetic character with flaws and yearnings and surrounding herself with a roster of talented actresses, Wiig has positioned herself as an every woman who has had life's ups and downs, but mostly downs and creating such pathos that the payoff at the end is more satisfying.  The scenes between Wiig and O'Dowd, who make a terrific couple, are genuine and really hold the story on a firm emotional footing.  As one of Lillian's friends, Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly) steals every scene she is in and provides the film with some of its funniest moments in support.  Even Byrne shines as the manipulative, scheming friend while Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey round out the wedding party.  As Annie's mom, Clayburgh performs a sweet, final career note; this was her last film.  Jon Hamm is only in a few scenes but is quite effective as a chauvinist jerk.There are numerous funny moments.  A toast to Lillian and her fianc&eacute; by Annie and Helen develops into dueling testimonials that become silly and outrageous.  When Annie gets stopped by a policeman, she displays her talent for physical comedy in conducting a drunk test.  A scene where she sits at her mom's home alone watching a video of Castaway's scene of Tom Hanks losing his `best friend' Wilson is a hoot.  On the plane when Annie mixes prescription medication and alcohol, she becomes obnoxiously and amusingly uninhibited, and there is a running gag with McCarthy who thinks her seat companion is really an air marshal.  Bridesmaids a film that is honest and direct about its subject matter and its consenting adults, and it has moments that are crude such as the food poisoning scene at the wedding boutique and some sexual gymnastics between Wiig and Hamm.The film is a bit uneven in places but when it hits the right notes especially towards the end, when a major character like Annie undergoes a transformation, it feels genuine and at times heartfelt, and we are the beneficiaries of something more than a pedestrian comedy.  When her relationship with Lillian is threatened, Annie reacts in exaggerated, desperate behavior.  She even has trouble accepting true intimacy from a good man because she has never been treated so nice.  It's really about Annie being able to connect in a meaningful way with another human being.  In fact, Annie's plight and desperation shares its DNA with Bridget Jones's Diary.With its predominantly female cast, this Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up) co-produced film delivers the laughs with feeling.  Don't think of this as just a `chick flick' but rather an entertaining, contemporary comedy that contains just a bit more estrogen.  And do stay for the closing credits if you want a bit of raunchy fun.",4,A BRIDESMAIDS To Celebrate,1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,5018,"['TV', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'long', 'been', 'proving',

Maya Rudolph (daughter of the famous Minnie Riperton) plays more of the straight role to Wiig's over the top comic relief.  Rose Byrne is divine as a conniving maid of honor wannabe, and Melissa McCarthy steals the show on many occasions as the one friend who ultimately gets Wiig's character ""Annie"" to finally see the light.  This is not a chick flick, but for those ladies looking for a delicious leading man, Chris O'Dowd plays a cute (and strong, and funny) Irish cop who stops ""Annie"" for a broken tail light, and eventually becomes the man she never realized she needs.

On DVD, the audio is clear coming through the front and center channels, good use of ambiance from the crowd and music coming from the surround channels but if you want better audio quality, once again, you will want to go for the Blu-ray version which should have a much more immersive soundtrack ala lossless.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Bridesmaids: Unrated"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring an enjoyable, upbeat and hilarious audio commentary (for the unrated edition) with director Paul Feig, co-writer Annie Mumolo and cast members Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McClendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper.Gag Reel - (3:47) Outtakes from ""Bridesmaids"".Line-O-Rama - (12:10) Featuring the multiple improvised scenes from `Bridesmaids"".Deleted Scenes- (7:52) Featuring three deleted scenes: Blind Date with Dave, Bonjour and Last chance.Additional Extended & Alternate Scenes - (8:40) Featuring five extended and alternate scenes: Meet Gil & Brynn, Judy on Barb, Ham Slacks, Becca Pukes Again, Split the Rent: BreastsCholodecki's Commercial - (1:05) Check out what's new with Cholodecki's when you watch the never-beforeseen ""commercial"" from Annie's jewelry employer!EXTRAS:""Bridesmaids: Unrated"" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:Finally, we get to see Kristen Wiig show us her true talent as a writer and as an actress in ""Bridesmaids"".Yes, she has appeared in ""MacGruber"" and ""Extract"" and of course, we see much more of her comedienne talents on ""Saturday Night Live"", but ""Bridesmaids"" is the film that allowed her to show her creative side as a writer but also as the lead actress.And what I loved about the movie is that while it does contain the hilarious, gut-busting gross out scenes that we are typically used to seeing on a Judd Apatow film, what ""Bridesmaids"" does much better than other Apatow films is that it manages to keep things real, in the fact that the situation Annie is in, happens to many people during this survival era during this economy.Depression from losing a business, depression from not making much income, depression of working a job that you don't enjoy, depression of things not working right in your life and things tend to compound itself one after the other with Annie that she is unable to deal with it.  She becomes reclusive, doesn't have many friends and the one true friend that she does have, she finds out that she has this other life with friends and also has a best friend, while Annie had always thought that she was Lilian's (Maya Rudolph) ""best friend"".Fortunately, ""Bridesmaids"" is a comedy thus the film doesn't explore the psyche, dark depression that Annie is in but instead showcases her ability to sabotage things in her life.  Her jealousy towards Helen (Rose Byrne) ignites this inner jealousy of trying to one-up her, but she is unable to and it just causes problems.Maya Rudolph's role as Lillian is possibly her best role to date.  While she does partake in some of the hilarious moments in the film, it's not forceful like other Apatow films where everyone has to be hilarious (or borderline-stupid).  She cares about her friend and trying to keep things balanced between her childhood friend Annie and her best friend Helen.And Rose Byrne does a fantastic job in playing the somewhat devious best friend that clamors for attention and always trying to remain positive despite not having any close relationships with anyone else around her but Lillian.  Similar to Rita, her stepkids are just as mean to her.  But Byrne looks absolutely ravishing in this role and also partakes in some of the fun moments of the film.But then you have the other female characters and once again, I'm sure people can relate to these type of women...Becca (Ellie Kemper) as the woman who has been with only one man and has never experienced other men, so she never really had the chance to explore and the other friend Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey) is a woman who may have married wealthy, but she is bitter about how life has changed after marriage and having children.  Having a husband who doesn't look at her the same when she was younger and having children who are young but yet are quite profane towards her.  So, Rita acts as the negative person towards Becca of how life will not always be happy and cheerful because of marriage.And then of course, you have the odd-ball Megan.  Melissa McCarthy's character is so off-the-wall, you just don't know what is going to come out of her mouth.  Surprising, hilarious and once again, the Apatow style of filmmaking of where improvisation really brings out the craziness of the character.  And just as off the wall are Annie's British roommates, you just don't know what will come out of their mouths as well, especially the visual of the female roommate (played by Rebel Wilson).And the film also has the one of the final appearances of the late Jill Clayburgh and also features the musical reunion of Wilson Phillips.The DVD contains both the regular theatrical edition and the director's cut. The main difference from what I have found is a scene in which Annie's British roommates are bathing with each other and when Annie goes on a blind date with a single father. There is nothing extra raunchy about the unrated version, but it was good choice for Paul Feig to eliminate those scenes from the theatrical edition.There are a good number of special features included and but if you have a Blu-ray player, I would definitely choose the Blu-ray edition over the DVD edition because their are many outdoor, colorful scenes and I have no doubt in my mind that those scenes would look much more vibrant in HD.Overall, ""Bridesmaids"" is a fantastic comedy.  Guys who are used to Apatow films can easily get into this film and see how an-all female cast can be equally funny (and gross) but I have to admit, of the many Apatow films I have seen so far, ""Bridesmaids"" is well-written and well-cast and strikes a fine balance between the crazy and hilarious moments of an Apatow film but yet managing to incorporate a screenplay that is fun, entertaining and worth watching.""Bridesmaids: Unrated"" is definitely recommended!",4,"Bridesmaids"" is hilarious, fun and a fantastic comedy!",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,7451,"['Saturday',

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[3, 4]","When BRIDESMAIDS made its theatrical run the spouse and I heard great word-of-mouth compliments from movie-goers, but we were never able to catch it.  So when this film appeared on cable I went out of my way to plan a viewing; now, having seen BRIDESMAIDS several times, I will be adding this hysterical romp to my movie collection.  BRIDESMAIDS is laugh out loud funny; it's snorting your drink through your nose funny; it's rolling on the couch funny.  Kristen Wiig leads this exceptional cast as insecure, self-destructive Annie, a woman with a knack for picking loser boyfriends (Jon Hamm in an uncredited role), with her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), getting married--and asking Annie to be her Maid of Honor.  Among the other bridesmaids is the beautiful, organized, and filthy rich Helen (Rose Byrne), who is vying to become Lillian's new best friend. . .and the cat fight is on, with knee slapping results and donkey-braying comedic bliss.This is not your Aunt Edna's comedy; this film has a decided raunchy edge, from total anarchy on a flight to Vegas, to a food poisoning attack during a dress fitting.  (""It's coming out of me like lava!"" proclaims Melissa McCarthy, part of the bridesmaid ensemble and an unabashed scene stealer.)  If seeing the female gender push the envelope into locker room humor makes you uncomfortable, BRIDESMAIDS is not for you.  Wiig aptly carries the freight, and her genuine chemistry with Rudolph is no doubt a byproduct of their years together on SNL.  You'll feel a twinge of sadness seeing Jill Clayburgh, playing Annie's mom, who died just a few months before the film's release.  One star off for the inevitable ""chick flick"" moments, including a sappy Wilson Phillips sing-a-long, along with an ending that was strangely wanting.  But who cares?

1386716,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00466HN7M,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","What I appreciate most about Kristen Wiig's comedy style on SNL is her refusal to pander to an audience. Portraying her gallery of solipsistic eccentrics week after week, she's never afraid to be unsympathetic because she exposes a truth that is smart and funny. Translating her gift to the big screen proves to be surprisingly fortuitous with her breakout 2011 comedy, which has already been dubbed the distaff version of the alpha-male mega-hit, 2009'sThe Hangover. They share an ensemble approach, a sometimes raunchy sense of humor, and the context of an upcoming wedding but little else. What you won't mistake this movie for is one of those dreary rom-coms starring invariably Katherine Heigl, Kate Hudson, or Jennifer Aniston.Co-written by Wiig and fellow Groundlings alumnus Annie Mumolo and breezily directed by Paul Feig (The Office), this is a sharp, character-driven farce freed from chick-flick predictability and showing the unmistakable fingerprints of co-producer Judd Apatow all over it. The plot centers on thirtysomething Annie Walker who is not in the best place in her life. Deep into debt after losing the cake shop she owned with a boyfriend who subsequently abandoned her, she is already a bit unstrung when her childhood best friend Lillian gets engaged. She names Annie her maid of honor, but there's competition for the coveted role from Lillian's new bestie, the wealthy and pretentious Helen. Much of the storyline focuses on the tension between Annie and Helen over Lillian's preferential attention until the wedding day. Within this context, much of the humor comes from the preposterous excesses that come from the ""wedding industrial complex"" with Helen obviously having the resources to fund them including a ludicrously over-the-top Paris-themed shower.Along for the ride are the three other bridesmaids - Lillian's cousin Rita, a sex-starved mother of three; Becca, a newlywed who pities Annie for her single state; and Megan, the groom's unfiltered, adventure-seeking sister. Needless to say, things don't go according to plan (the diuretic bridal shop scene is a hoot), and the shenanigans are underlined by the obvious rift occurring between two best friends when one moves on with her life. Beyond her comedy set pieces (e.g., her increasingly hilarious efforts in attempting to get a traffic citation), Wiig turns out to be a resourceful actress as Annie and dials back her trademark neurotic lunacy just enough to make Annie's dilemmas humanly relatable. As Lillian, SNL alumnus Maya Rudolph (Away We Go) has less to do but does it with warmth and wit. Rose Byrne, who showed deft comic chops inGet Him to the Greek, captures the haughtiness and insecurity in Helen with &eacute;lan.However, stealing scenes with sheer abandon is a makeup-free Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan with such balls-to-the-wall force that it's hard not to respond to her uncompromised honesty. Her character is arguably the most mentally stable of the bunch. Wendy McLendon-Covey (Reno 911) and Ellie Kemper (The Office) have their moments as sarcastic Rita and naive Becca, but they aren't given much screen time to flesh out their funnier bits. Jon Hamm (Mad Men) really nails the blistering albeit charming indifference that his character Ted shows toward Annie's romantic longings, while Irish actor Chris O'Dowd proves likeably puppyish as her burgeoning love interest, a traffic cop constantly reprimanding her for not fixing her brake lights. In her final film appearance, the wonderful Jill Clayburgh is sweetly amusing as Annie's whimsically off-kilter mother. It all runs a bit too long at 125 minutes with the resolutions a bit pat, but still, this is one of the funniest movies of the year.",4,"Wiig and Company Deliver Honest Laughs in a Freewheeling, Character-Driven Farce",1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,3721,"['What', 'appreciate', 'most', 'about', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'comedy', 'style', 'SNL', 'refusal', 'pander', 'audience', 'Portraying', 'gallery', 'solipsistic', 'eccentrics', 'week', 'week', 'never', 'afraid', 'be', 'unsympathetic', 'truth', 'smart', 'funny', 'Translating', 'gift', 'big', 'screen', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'fortuitous', 'breakout', '2011', 'comedy', 'already', 'been', 'dubbed', 'distaff', 'version', 'alpha-male', 'mega-hit', ""2009'sThe"", 'Hangover', 'share', 'ensemble', 'approach', 'sometimes', 'raunchy', 'sense', 'humor', 'context', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'little', 'else', 'What', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'movie', 'one', 'dreary', 'rom-coms', 'starring', 'invariably', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston.Co-written', 'Wiig', 'fellow', 'Groundlings', 'alumnus', 'Annie', 'Mumolo', 'breezily', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'Office', 'sharp', 'character-driven', 'farce', 'freed', 'chick-flick', 'predictability', 'showing', 'unmistakable', 'fingerprints', 'co-producer', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'plot', 'centers', 'thirtysomething', 'Annie', 'Walker', 'who', 'not', 'best', 'place', 'life', 'Deep', 'debt', 'losing', 'cake', 'shop', 'owned', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'subsequently', 'abandoned', 'already', 'bit', 'unstrung', 'when', 'childhood', 'best', 'friend', 'Lillian', 'engaged', 'names', 'Annie', 'maid', 'honor', 'competition', 'coveted', 'role', 'Lillian', 'new', 'bestie', 'wealthy', 'pretentious', 'Helen', 'Much', 'storyline', 'tension', 'Annie', 'Helen', 'Lillian', 'preferential', 'attention', 'wedding', 'day', 'context', 'much', 'humor', 'preposterous', 'excesses', 'come', 'wedding', 'industrial', 'complex', 'Helen', 'obviously', 'having', 'resources', 'fund', 'including', 'ludicrously', 'over-the-top', 'Paris-themed', 'shower.Along', 'ride', 'are', 'three', 'other', 'bridesmaids', 'Lillian', 'cousin', 'Rita', 'sex-starved', 'mother', 'three', 'Becca', 'newlywed', 'who', 'Annie', 'single', 'state', 'Megan', 'groom', 'unfiltered', 'adventure-seeking', 'sister', 'Needless', 'say', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'diuretic', 'bridal', 'shop', 'scene', 'hoot', 'shenanigans', 'are', 'underlined', 'obvious', 'rift', 'occurring', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'when', 'one', 'life', 'comedy', 'set', 'pieces', 'e.g.', 'increasingly', 'hilarious', 'efforts', 'attempting', 'get', 'traffic', 'citation', 'Wiig', 'out', 'be', 'resourceful', 'actress', 'Annie', 'dials', 'back', 'trademark', 'neurotic', 'lunacy', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'Annie', 'dilemmas', 'humanly', 'relatable', 'Lillian', 'SNL', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Away', 'Go', 'less', 'do', 'warmth', 'wit', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'who', 'showed', 'deft', 'comic', 'chops', 'inGet', 'Him', 'Greek', 'haughtiness', 'insecurity', 'Helen', 'eacute', 'stealing', 'scenes', 'sheer', 'abandon', 'makeup-free', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'Megan', 'such', 'balls-to-the-wall', 'force', 'hard', 'not', 'respond', 'uncompromised', 'honesty', 'character', 'arguably', 'most', 'mentally', 'stable', 'bunch', 'Wendy', 'McLendon-Covey', 'Reno', '911', 'Ellie', 'Kemper', 'Office', 'have', 'moments', 'sarcastic', 'Rita', 'naive', 'Becca', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'funnier', 'bits', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'Mad', 'Men', 'really', 'blistering', 'charming', 'indifference', 'character', 'Ted', 'Annie', 'romantic', 'longings', 'Irish', 'actor', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'likeably', 'puppyish', 'burgeoning', 'love', 'interest', 'traffic', 'cop', 'constantly', 'reprimanding', 'not', 'fixing', 'brake', 'lights', 'final', 'film', 'appearance', 'wonderful', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'sweetly', 'amusing', 'Annie', 'whimsically', 'off-kilter', 'mother', 'bit', 'too', 'long', '125', 'minutes', 'resolutions', 'bit', 'pat', 'still', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'year']",N/A

I also liked the message about not placing all men into one category.  Some men really do have big hearts....though I doubt these types of men would sleep with a woman on the first date.  I'd think a man who wears his heart on his sleeve would take it slowly so his heart couldn't get broken so easily.My main problem with this movie is that the dialogue felt untrue at times.  For example, there's a scene in the store where Annie tells off a young girl in a blunt way that didn't seem like something her character would say.  I also didn't think a guy would really be that blunt in bed.  And I didn't think the bridesmaid who stole the party favors would really be that aggressive with people.Don't get me wrong, I love seeing inappropriate people in comedies.  They usually crack me up, but they only do so when there's a sincerity behind their actions.  The outrageousness in this comedy felt like it was trying too hard at times.I'm also not a big fan of raunch humor and in this movie, one scene is so over the top, I had to look away.

Usually her face is contorted, her voice rises and falls several octaves, and in general she's spazzing out.  I really like that Kristen Wiig, and I didn't get to see enough of her in this movie.  She's really only allowed to let go in a few scenes, which is too bad.  I kept hearing that she made it a point to step aside and let the others share the spotlight, and I think that was a mistake.  I don't know some of their names but here are my thoughts on the other characters:  Wendy what's her name from 'Reno 911' had some funny stuff and I wanted more.  The girl from 'The Office' might as well have not been in the movie.  Maya Rudolph was really the straight character in the mix and so didn't have much range to work with; she was pretty bland.  I liked the heavy set gal and again wanted more.  I didn't like the Rose Byrne character or her assoctiated plot device at all.  I don't mean that I hated the smart, rich, girl, but instead that the character didn't work or fit.  They could have taken this film so many ways and on any number of adventures and yet decided to work solely on the ""scorned best friend"" angle.  Byrne's charecter was just a really bland foil to Wiig; they're was never really any zing or spark in their rivalry.  They're scenes together seem to take up at least a quarter of the film, and they're not good.  The toast scene at the first engagement party comes to mind; it felt like it was a half hour long.  This was no 'Hangover,' as it seemed to be billed.  It's a vehicle for Wiig that didn't ever really let her get behind the wheel, and so as a result it's just an average chick flick with a few really funny scenes.",3,The Hangover lite,1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,1732,"['Kristen', 'Wiig', 'best', 'doing', 'own', 'brand', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Usually', 'face', 'contorted', 'voice', 'rises', 'several', 'octaves', 'general', 'spazzing', 'out', 'really', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'enough', 'movie', 'really', 'only', 'allowed', 'let', 'go', 'few', 'scenes', 'too', 'bad', 'kept', 'hearing', 'made', 'point', 'step', 'aside', 'let', 'others', 'share', 'spotlight', 'think', 'was', 'mistake', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'names', 'here', 'are', 'thoughts', 'other', 'characters', 'Wendy', 'what', 'name', '911', 'had', 'funny', 'stuff', 'wanted', 'more', 'girl', ""'The"", 'Office', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'movie', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'was', 'really', 'straight', 'character', 'mix', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'range', 'work', 'was', 'pretty', 'bland', 'liked', 'heavy', 'set', 'gal', 'again', 'wanted', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'character', 'assoctiated', 'plot', 'device', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'hated', 'smart', 'rich', 'girl', 'instead', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'fit', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'number', 'adventures', 'yet', 'decided', 'work', 'solely', 'scorned', 'best', 'friend', 'angle', 'Byrne', 'charecter', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'bland', 'foil', 'Wiig', ""'re"", 'was', 'never', 'really', 'zing', 'spark', 'rivalry', ""'re"", 'scenes', 'together', 'seem', 'take', 'up', 'least', 'quarter', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'good', 'toast', 'scene', 'first', 'engagement', 'party', 'mind', 'felt', 'was', 'half', 'hour', 'long', 'was', ""'Hangover"", 'seemed', 'be', 'billed', 'vehicle', 'Wiig', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'let', 'get', 'wheel', 'so', 'result', 'just', 'average', 'chick', 'flick', 'few', 'really', 'funny', 'scenes']",N/A

In many ways the film was a surprise, actually better than expected. The promo for the film was that it was a female version of HANGOVER or BORAT, an attempt to demonstrate to guys that women can be just as gross and vulgar as men.  But actually the story is more a tale of a group of sad women, unhappy in many ways with their relationships with not only men but also with other women.  Written by star Kristen Wigg and Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig it is a pulled together series of vignettes about women in distress, and while it does include the gross-out promises of PR (barf/flatulence/body insert references) and the manner in which women in competition behave, it still remains a story of how sad people cope.Annie (Kristin Wiig) is a barely employed woman who has lost her dream of having her own bakery and having a  meaningless physical relationship with cad Ted (Jon Hamm) relies on her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) to get through life, until Lillian announces she is getting married and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. Even though Annie is broke, living with a disgusting British brother and sister as a roomer, she accepts the responsibilities.  The sparkle of the wedding dream plans fizzles when Annie meets the incongruous group of women who will be bridesmaids: the wealthy, haughty Helen (Rose Byrne), the obese socially gross Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the oversexed inappropriate mother Rita (Wendi McLendon McCarthy) and the silly insubstantial Becca (Ellie Kemper).  In a series of gag moments - eating in a Brazilian caf&eacute;, trying on dresses, a grossly overdone flight in the direction of Las Vegas, and a preposterous wedding shower - the girls fall apart as potential friends only, of course, to some together in the end.There are a few redeeming elements in the film that are worthy of attention - the Irish police officer Nathan Rhodes  a sparkling Chris O'Dowd) who provides the only semblance of true sentiment in Annie's ridiculous life and Annie's mother played by Jill Clayburgh in what was to be her last role (she died of Leukemia seen after the film was completed).  Kristin Wiig does carry the film, despite the fact that her expressions and character show minimal variation as the story plods along. But in the end, despite all the attempts to out-gross HANGOVER, this is a sad little film about bruised women  and how their interdependence provides a way out of the meaningless lives they lead.

1386752,AKT0Y6J9AK469,B00466HN7M,"GumbyTheCat ""Gumby""","[4, 6]","""Bridesmaids"" is a movie I somewhat reluctantly chose to see. I say ""reluctantly"" for two reasons - 1) as a guy I'm not into the ""chick flick"" or ""rom-com"" genres  and 2) the two leads (Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph) are both SNL veterans, and the sub-sub-mediocre Saturday Night Live lost all appeal to me a long time ago. However, a lady I recently started dating wanted me to pick a movie, and ""Bridesmaids"" seemed like the most promising of the dismal batch of movies currently showing in theaters. My ladyfriend kind of looked at me cross-eyed when I told her that's the movie I chose - ""Really? That doesn't seem like the kind of movie a guy would pick"". She was going solely by the title of the movie, though - I had done some internet research and knew that this movie had more up its sleeve than the title would imply. So, I hoped at least it wouldn't bore me to death.We went and saw it last night, and as it turned out I was lucky enough to have picked a winner. ""Bridesmaids"" is a sendup of male-driven gross-out buddy movies and a romantic comedy, a mix that I thought wouldn't work very well. And indeed there are some themes in the movie that seem forced or contrived, and wear a bit thin as the surprisingly long comedy (2 hours, 5 minutes theatrical running time) unfolds. But Wiig, who I hadn't known of before because of my disassociation from SNL, carries the movie wonderfully. She effortlessly portrays Annie, a discontented mid-thirtysomething who has pretty much failed at life. Her life takes a wild turn when her best friend Lillian (Rudolph) asks her to be maid of honor at her wedding. Annie immediately runs afoul of Lillian's new friend Helen (Rose Byrne), who as the controlling, rich trophy wife of Lillian's fiance's boss, uses her money and passive-aggressive elitism to not only foil Annie at every turn, but to draw Lillian away from Annie as well. Every time Annie tries to regain an even footing with Helen and re-take control of the duties (and prestige) of maid of honor, Helen, and Annie's own self-destructive incompetence, stop her dead in her tracks - always with laugh-inducing results.Not all the bridesmaid characters are fully fleshed-out in this movie, but they all do get their turn to contribute to the laughs. Bridesmaid Megan, boisterously portrayed by the in-your-face Melissa McCarthy, stole just about every scene she played a major role in. I was prepared to dislike her character based on her first appearance; at first it seemed like she was just cast to be the token, one-dimensional, overweight, plain, ""fart joke"" nobody in a group of otherwise prettier and more polished women. Megan has about as much class and sophistication as an ox in heat. However, as the movie progressed I began to like Megan a lot; in her totally unpolished and uncultured way she was the most honest, wise and forthright of the group. It's definitely worth watching a minute or two into the final credits, as Megan gets one more chance to shine her belching, flatulent light. For better or worse, the words ""bear sandwich"" will be indelibly seared into your mind after watching her final scene.The movie's most talked-about scene, a vomit- and feces-fest where the bridesmaids go shopping for dresses at an incredibly upscale and snooty bridal boutique after getting food poisoning at a run-down Brazilian restaurant (a restaurant picked by Annie, naturally), is deliberately plunked into the middle of the movie by the director (Paul Feig) as an ode to every gross-out guy flick ever made. Yeah, it was funny in its slapstick, gross-out way, but I'm still debating whether that scene, drawn-out as it was, was totally necessary. It seemed to be artificially inserted in the movie. But what the hey, it got the laughs and ""e[...]"" audience reactions it was going for.Wiig has a natural gift for physical comedy, and she demonstrates both the subtle and over-the-top aspects of this gift throughout. Her drunken attempts to sneak into first class on a flight to Las Vegas and subsequent run-ins with a prissy male flight attendant and the flight's air marshal are a gem. She's pretty, but in a down-to-earth way, and does not rely on her looks in the least to drive the film forward (other than using her wonderfully expressive face to convey her character's quirky, needy, flawed personality). ""Bridesmaids"" is Wiig's first cinematic star vehicle, and she did very well presenting us with a characterization of Annie as a character who is both sympathetic and humorous, both deeply human and clownish. I look forward to her next effort.Overall, I consider this movie a winner. Obviously a lot of other people thought so as well; it has grossed over 100 million dollars after costing 32 million to make. My ladyfriend and I both enjoyed this movie greatly. Advice to the guys reading this review - ""Bridesmaids"" is worth your time because although the movie is a nuptial-themed female-driven endeavor, this movie definitely is not your typical chick-flick rom-com. I will be pre-ordering this from Amazon, for sure.",4,A 'Chick Flick' For Everyone,1308355200,"06 18, 2011",2011,5053,"['Bridesmaids', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'reluctantly', 'chose', 'see', 'say',

No job, no money, has to move home and now her best friend, Lil, who's engaged, is warming up to a new friend, Helen. So now, Annie sees her BFF drifting away from her and it's unbearable for her. The scene in the bridal shop is gross, but the scene in the airplane is hysterical. At the bridal shower scene we not only see Annie's total breakdown, but also Lil finally blowing her top at Annie. Up until that point, we see Lil as a really good and understanding friend. The brother & sister roommates are total madcap hilarity...and it was great to see Jill Claybourgh in her last role. I think you need to see this movie several times to catch all the undertones of friendship, marriage and someone really frightened that she's losing everything important. I took away one star for the following...when a woman gets engaged, her bff wants to see the ring, talk about the ring, etc. Annie just takes a quick peak, which is strange since she works in a jewelry store.

The tipping point is that BRIDESMAIDS comes with a core of emotional truth whereas if you lift that sense of mystery from THE HANGOVER, what's left is a series of skits. BRIDESMAIDS comes with more heart. It passes the smell test, demonstrates staying power. Odds are, it won't be long before other films are being lauded as ""the next BRIDESMAIDS."" And, based on that comparison, I might check out that other film, too.Our self-destructive lead character Annie (Kristen Wiig) is informed that ""hitting bottom is a good thing,"" but I think we all know that's a bunch of baloney, a heap of hooey. Character building can go fudge itself if it means one has to go thru what Annie does just to learn valuable life lessons. Annie's had a bad time of it. Her bakery shop went south. Her boyfriend is this self-absorbed, belittling, non-committing assclown. She rooms with an odd and portly British brother and sister whose presence, let's face it, can't possibly make anyone feel comfortable. Her current job as sales clerk at a jewelry store is as fulfilling as it sounds. And, to point out the cherry on her misery cake, Annie's best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), is getting married, with Annie tapped as the maid of honor.Oh, does Annie have issues. She's one of life's self-saboteurs; she can be blamed for much of the bad joss what's befallen her. She loves her best friend dearly, but the cheap, pathetic side of her can't help but be resentful that their lives are going opposite ways. And since the hits keep on coming, why not now introduce the magnificent Helen (a very good Rose Byrne). Helen is the gorgeous trophy wife of Lillian's fiance's boss, and she's struck up a friendship with Lillian. Helen, wealthy as Croesus, supernaturally efficient at organizing weddings, and determined not to be upstaged. Helen and Annie immediately get on like houses on fire. Annie senses that Helen is poaching her best friend. Out comes the competitive streak. Except that Annie isn't as straight-faced sneaky as Helen. Watch Annie fall apart.The theater I went to became sheer bedlam, rocking with belly laughs so raucous that entire chunks of dialogue went unheard. So that means something. Unless you're a friggin' recluse, you must have some down-to-earth women friends. These bridesmaids are drawn from stereotypes, but these actresses are all so funny. I can point out several of my women pals who fit several of these molds to a damn T. The fantastic cast works so well together. I haven't laughed so hard in years as when the bridal shop disaster went down. Anyway, this shouldn't come as a shock: Women sleep around, and often exercise the right to be vulgar when in comfortable company, and they certainly engage in scatological humor. Wendi McLendon-Covey (""Rita"") is one of the bridesmaids, a discontented housewife with unruly kids, and although she's not in the movie a lot, she makes an impression (especially with that ""crack the blanket in half"" line). But it's the unfiltered Melissa McCarthy (""Megan""), built like a pugnacious fire hydrant, who ends up stealing the scenes.Not having watched SNL in forever long, I didn't know Kristen Wiig from Shatner's wig. But now she's fixed on my radar, and now I expect this same level of funny out of her. Kristen Wiig is amazing in BRIDESMAIDS, co-writing it, performing in it. Her character is at turns petty and self-pitying and abusive, and yet there's a pained vulnerability and an innate likability that makes you invest in her. She's so sad sack. You long for her to get her sh-- together, and you pull for her to get with that charming highway patrol cop with the unexpected Irish accent. But she's so resistant, so stuck in her rut. You pull for her.Setting aside Wiig's ability to emote (which apparently surprised people left and right), her comic talents are what separate her from the pack. She has exquisite comic timing. What she does in that airplane sequence is spectacular stuff. And she exhibits marvelous chemistry with Maya Rudolph. Their friendship feels real; it helps to ground the story. I think this is a huge turning point for Kristen Wiig's career, if she rides this good momentum. And BRIDESMAIDS, it's one of them rare animals, a chick flick that a guy can sit thru without feeling that he's fulfilling an obligation to the girlfriend or the wife.The DVD gives you the option to watch the Theatrical Version or the Unrated Version, and also the following bonus stuff:- Lively Audio Commentary with director Paul Feig, co-writer Annie Mumolo, and actors Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and Ellie Kemper- 3 Deleted Scenes, including Annie on a horrible blind date with Paul Rudd (totaling 00:07:48 minutes)- 5 Extended & Alternate Scenes,

1386769,A2RE5ZLL3RB084,B00466HN7M,H. P.,"[26, 44]","When a person wallows in self-pity after being chosen maid of honor for her closest friend's wedding because another of the chosen bridesmaids is wealthier, better adjusted, appears to have grown closer to the bride, and over-the-top extravagant in her prenuptial celebrations, one may be inclined to show some sympathy.  When that same person allows herself to repeatedly be used and then discarded, erupts into a jealous and destructive rage at bridal shower, rejects a decent man who really does like her and proves beneficial, and desperately attempts to suppress the joy of happy customers while working as a saleswoman in a jewelry store, reactions more likely range from wanting to slap her and tell her to get over herself, to strongly suggesting that she seek immediate psychiatric help.  So is the protagonist of Bridesmaids.While billed as a comedy, its overall tone is a bit sad: a woman whose business has failed, cannot seem to succeed in a relationship herself, and has been forced to move back home with her mother begins to come unglued as her best friend approaches her wedding. Sure, there are some mildly humorous episodes: the eccentric mother who has never had a drink but attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings because she finds them inspirational, the vacuous roommate who gets an atrocious tattoo because it is free, the competitive toasting between the protagonist and her adversary.  But these minor episodes are overshadowed by an overall tone that is not very happy, a plot that is not particularly interesting, and a protagonist that is not all that likeable.  Add to that the horrendous bridal shop scene, in which the viewer is treated to both vomit and defecation, and one has, well, a dud.If one wishes to see a romance about a likeable but dispirited woman who finds some manages to persevere and find some pleasant romantic joy in her life, see Bridget Jones' Diary.  If one wants to see pure comedy, watch Seinfeld re-runs.

Her bakery shop has just failed and she's seeing Ted (an uncredited Jon Hamm), who obviously doesn't give a damn about her.  As a result, Annie's self-esteem is at a low point.  To matter's worse, her bestfriend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is getting married, which means she'll soon be spending less time in Annie's life for emotional support.Lillian has selected Annie as her maid of honor, but given the drama in Annie's personal life, Annie is having trouble keeping up with her obligations.  To fill in the slack, one of the bridesmaids Helen (Rose Byrne) steps in and soon takes over, threatening Annie's friendship with Lillian.Offering a ray of home in Annie's life is Nathan (Chris O'Dowd), a police officer that gives her a break on a citation.  A romance soon develops, but the emotionally damaged Annie does everything in her power to derail the relationship.The thing that distinguishes ""Bridesmaids"" from numerous wedding pictures that preceded it is how the women behave.  They are just as wild and raunchy as men.Also, unlike the wedding comedy, ""Jumping the Broom"" that was released around the same time, the situations develop organically from the characters.  The characters behave in logical, if sometimes predictable ways. They also each have distinguishable characteristics. For example, despite Helen's prissy exterior, we see her humanity and vulnerability.Also, in a subtle way, ""Bridesmaids"" touches upon some serious issues, like how people have been impacted by the economy and how difficult it is for some people to have healthy relationships.Despite Annie's many emotional issues, we understand Annie's behavior and where it comes from. One would only wish that it weren't taken to quite the extreme it does in the film.Overall, ""Bridesmaids"" is an entertaining film with colorful characters that is never dull or boring.

BRIDESMAIDS is outrageous fun and a bit of a shocker at times. This times it the ladies who get to be the ""bad guys"" but in a good way. Lillian played by Maya Rudolph is about to get married. Kristen Wiig is Annie who just happened to be Lillian's oddball but loveable best friend. Enter Whitney who is desperately competing to be Lillian's new best friend and the best wedding planner ever. Annie and Whitney try to outdo each other and become number one in Lillian's eyes.Bathroom humor and wild language abound in this film. BRIDESMAIDS is not a family film but both men and women will enjoy it. It goes far beyond the so-called ""chick flick."" Kristin Wiig is always a delight to watch and nothing is funnier than her trying to get arrested for a moving violation as her boyfriend cop is ignoring her. Who is driving that car anyway?That late Jill Clayburgh plays Annie's mother. It's bittersweet to see her one last time in a not so inspiring role. Matt Lucas, star of Englands hit comedy series, LITTLE BRITAIN, has a bit of an odd role as Annie's roommate. The living situation is even more odd as his sister has planted herself in the apartment and is paying no rent. I'm not sure why a popular British comedic actor was thrown into the mix and not used at all to the best of his talents.Not to be missed is the girls as they go to try on wedding and bridesmaids dresses after having some seriously bad Brazilian food. Bathroom humor explodes-literally.I took the time to watch the extras and Paul Rudd was originally in the movie in a small role that didn't making the cut in the end.BRIDESMAIDS is just great fun on that night when you just want a silly laugh.

There are moments of vulgarity and a little too much bathroom humor, but all in all this comedy is good-natured and in the end has a sweet lesson to learn: Only Annie can make her life better.  Chris O'Dowd was wonderful as the cop who pulled her over because of broken taillights and, then, when they meet again they strike up a friendship.  He wants more but Annie is so used to bad guys that she doesn't know how to proceed when a good guy comes along.  Also, it was nice to see Franklyn Ajaye who played Lillian's father again after not seeing him for years in anything.  Melissa McCarthy was a standout performer.

The movie is a tremendously funny look at getting ready for a wedding from the perspective of a less-than-perfect Bridesmaid.  It mixes in some very funny jokes and moments that could take place anywhere with some really outrageous and funny moments that have to be seen to be believed.  The nice thing about this is, like the first ""Hangover"" movie, while the moments are over the top (such as the food poisoning scene in the bridal shop), none of them really seem out of place or forced, which is a tough thing to pull off in a comedy.Kristen Wiig is fantastic as the old friend who feels like she's getting pushed aside by the new friend who seems to have it all.  She's obviously got a lot of issues of her own to work through already, and you can see this as the straw that breaks the camel's back.  She's desperate for the love and attention of someone, and her reactions to not gettting it range from the mild to the hysterical!  The nice thing about the performance, though, is that you never feel like Wiig is screaming for the attention.  Rather, you feel like she keeps getting the short-end of the stick from everyone, whether it's her creepy British roommates, the guy she's sleeping with but who won't commit (played by a very funny Jon Hamm in an uncredited role) or the bridesmaid who's trying to steal her best friend.The rest of the cast is just as good.  Maya Rudolph is very good and very restrained as the bride-to-be who is struggling to make everyone happy.  Chris O'Dowd is slightly awkward (in a good way) and sweet as a cop who is trying to develop something with Kristen Wiig.  And Melissa McCarthy is hilarious as the sister of the groom and the one who seems to understand the best what Wiig is going through.I only have two issues with the movie that keep it from getting five stars.  First, there should have been a little more development of the other two bridesmaids' characters, as I thought they were just as funny as any other character in the movie.  Also, some of the gags dragged on for too long (such as when Wiig is trying to get pulled over).Overall, though, the movie is very funny and very sweet at the same time.  The end is perfectly done and refrains from going in the totally obvious direction that so many other movies like it would.

Or sometimes it was just over the top and bizarre, but always hilarious.I can't believe she could make something so mediocre like ""Bridesmaids"".  This movie was not funny at all.  I did not laugh once.  People often compare it to ""The Hangover"" but the ""The Hangover"" actually had some funny moments of sheer stupidity.  I wouldn't say that was a great comedy either.The message I got from this movie is that if you don't get married or have a great career your life is pathetic and not worth living.  The fact that Wiig's character works in retail is portrayed as almost tragic, like she's the biggest loser ever.  I can't believe humor like that would go over so well, especially in this bad economy when most people are lucky to have any kind of job.Considering Judd Apatow produced this it makes sense.  Any film he is involved with usually involves mocking working class people.  They should change the name of this movie to ""White People Problems"".Could anyone honestly sympathize with Wiig's character over losing her bakery?  I mean businesses fail all the time.  Owning a bakery is a pretty self-indulgent career, most people do not need cupcakes.Also, half the female characters in this film seem to be suffering from Borderline personality disorder, they are needy, emotionally unstable, and have no ability to be alone.God, what an awful movie.

Apparently she was supposed to be a sympathetic character but she came off as simply a pathetic, whining, self pitying, anorexic jerk. Why on earth would any girl get so bent out of shape by the engagement of a girl who was supposed to be her best friend that she just goes nuts. Or, was she nuts all along and the engagement just pushed her over the edge. It leaves you with the impression that this friendship was the only thing she had and if it was changing then she just had to behave so badly that everyone would notice her instead of the bride. Instead of being happy and supportive of her friend, she made the whole thing about her starting with the way too long scene near the beginning of the movie where she competes with the stepmother in making the toast. And, couldn't they have found a better looking bride.  That girl was just ""plain"". But, the movie was funny and I guess that is what it was meant to be. The scene near the end where she keeps racing her car up and down breaking all kinds of laws trying to make the policeman notice her was too long and annoying also. Contrived is what comes to mind.

1386818,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00466HN7M,J. Martin,"[0, 2]","Bridesmaids was a huge hit with both critics and audiences because it successfully combined what women think is funny with what men think is funny.Women think relationships are funny, whether the relationships are with men, other women, children, pets, cars, jobs (more or less in that order) ... with anything, in other words, as long as the humor gently points out how exasperating but challenging and potentially rewarding it is to try to relate to other creatures, animate or inanimate. In sharp contrast, men don't think anything is funny except doing in public what normal people do only alone in the bathroom with the door locked. Bridesmaids' considerable achievement is combining those two seemingly incompatible elements seamlessly into one coherent movie.As a gay man, I most enjoyed the relationship humor, but as a man, I laughed out loud (and I really couldn't help it, because I tried) ONLY at the scene where all the women suffer food poisoning in the high-class, by-appointment-only, white-carpeted bridal shop - especially Melissa McCarthy perched on the sink.I think I can safely say that every single male human being who saw this movie laughed out loud at that scene; and many of the straight men afterward congratulated themselves, astonished that they were able to enjoy a chick-flick. That's because THIS otherwise ordinary chick-flick was peppered with enough guy gross-out humor to keep them from fidgeting, but not with so much that it turned women off.

Nothing wrong with that--the dress shop scene has some of the funniest moments I've seen in a while.  But its comedy works against it at times.  Annie's bit in the airplane is evidently supposed to be funny, but she's in such a sad place in her life that her antics only left me feeling sorry for her.  It's kind of like meeting someone on the bus who has an obvious disability or speech impediment.  You want to help them, but can't.  What might be funny from someone who's otherwise in control of their life (say a drunken night on the town) suddenly turns to sad when that control isn't there.  It's similar to someone who laughs hysterically at something that's not funny--you wonder what's wrong with them, and likely feel a pang of sympathy.Annie's like this throughout the entire movie.  You want her to take a deep breath, realize that she has something to offer the world, and really try to look beyond her first impressions of people.  Nobody is really quite what they show to the rest of the world.  In Helen's case, a seemingly perfect life is only a mask for her own insecurities.  The opposite is true of Megan, who adopts nine dogs, but turns out to have adjusted very well to her situation in life.  What's truly sad about Annie is that she doesn't have the emotional intelligence at 40 to say ""Stop--how do I really feel about this wedding?  What does it say about me?  If I've always turned to my best friend before, who can I turn to now to talk about this?""

1386830,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00466HN7M,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","The latest film from super-producer Judd Apatow seems out to prove that women can be just as funny, and raunchy, as men. Starring SNL-veteran Kristen Wiig (who also co-wrote the script with Annie Mumolo), Bridesmaids isn't much of a departure from other Apatow-produced comedies, containing the same improvisational, gross-out humor that typically characterizes his films, with the only difference being it has a cast lead by women. I saw the film in a theatre that was about 95% full, with about 85% women, and the other 10% husbands that were dragged to the show by their wives. There is a target audience for Bridesmaids and while it can be enjoyed by both sexes, the women laughed hysterically at every joke I didn't laugh at...Or perhaps it was just every joke. If you fall into this target audience, you may enjoy the film more than I did...And I actually quite enjoyed it.Wiig plays Annie, whose personal life is in a state of turmoil. Her cake shop has gone under, leaving her to slave away at a jewelry store, she's low on money, and the only man in her life (an uncredited Jon Hamm, who, if you'll excuse the pun, is hamming it up and seems to be having fun) is a little too honest about their relationship status. In the midst of all this, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), Annie's friend since childhood, has recently become engaged and has asked Annie to be her Maid of Honor. She also selects four bridesmaids; Helen (Rose Byrne), Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), Becca (Ellie Kemper), and her fianc&eacute;e's sister Megan (Melissa McCarthy). Adding to Annie's personal troubles is her insecurity over Lillian's friendship with Helen, who takes charge of nearly all of the wedding details. Meanwhile, Annie meets a sweet Irish cop named Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) while the stress of Lillian's wedding piles on.The six women that lead the ensemble each have a different style of humor that both fits in with and complements the film perfectly. There is, however, an unspoken and rarely discussed rule of ensemble comedies that dictate two things: (a) no less than one character will be underutilized, in this case Becca, the nave newlywed and (b) one character must stand-out from the rest due to the way they contrast with the main characters, in this case Megan, the odd, overweight sister of the groom. Each actress is very funny in her own way, with Wiig convincingly embodying Annie and scoring many laughs throughout. McLendon-Covey as Rita, an unsatisfied wife and mother, has a hilarious deadpan that seemed to really click with the audience. If I were to speculate I'd say that Rita touches on the things that mothers would never say out loud. The whole cast had me laughing at various points in the film, but it is McCarthy whom I would call my personal favorite and, in my eyes, is the star of the show.I admit to being easily amused and I have found terrible comedies passable because of my lack-of-resistance to amusement. It's easy to make me smile, chuckle, or even laugh a little bit. What doesn't come easily to me is full-on, gut-busting, teary-eyed laughter. From the first moment McCarthy appears onscreen as Megan, she had me in tears and, to my surprise, this happened again and again nearly every time she appeared onscreen. Yes, she plays a character not unfamiliar to the world of comedy, but she brings such a unique charm and comedic presence to the role. There are moments with her character that are built on gross-out gags, but, shamefully, I laughed. In fact, McCarthy made me laugh harder than I can ever recall laughing in a theatre. This is not hyperbole; she had me in stitches.The gross-out humor in Bridesmaids does not go anywhere we haven't seen men go in thousands of comedies over the years. There is one particular scene at a dress boutique that sent most of the theatre into riotous fits of laughter. I wonder to myself if Wiig included the scene to make a point about double-standards in film, as no one complains when men do the same thing in movies. Well, I do; I'm not a fan of humor that revolves around flatulence and bodily functions. To me, it's nothing more than lazy writing and, while my theatre seemed to place me in the minority, I found it more repulsive than funny. As, by Hollywood standards, the cast is made up of average-looking women (a good thing, as it's easier for an audience to connect with Wiig and Rudolph, who look like normal people), I do wonder if this scene would have elicited the same laughter from a cast of big-star, Hollywood bombshells. Either way, I would have no complaints about this scene being left on the cutting-room floor.While the film starts off strong, I feel it loses steam in the second half when it veers towards a more dramatic route and becomes weighed down by its own seriousness. Apatow films seem to follow this template often; a first hour of non-stop hilarity and a second of turgid drama. I am being a bit rough on the dramatic elements here, as they have a good message and are essentially well handled, just not as effectively as the comedy. I attribute this to the writing; the comedy is improvisational and spontaneous, which leaves the dramatic stuff feeling more scripted. Annie's romance with the Irish cop, for example, is cute and sweet, but overly predictable. Fortunately, the film is kept consistently entertaining by this very talented group of women, but a little more consistency in the storytelling wouldn't have hurt.It's not perfect and with a 125-minute running time (with trailers, you're looking at a theatre experience of 2 hours and 20 minutes) it could have been trimmed a bit in the editing room, but Bridesmaids is still one of the surprise comedies of the year. I knew women could be raunchy, but I doubted their ability to carry a raunchy comedy themselves.

I felt you had a great cast, with lots of possibilities. There were a lot of open ended plot lines and ideas that just got forgotten about. For example, the ladies are on the plane going to Vegas. Chaos ensues, and the are off the plane in Wyoming on a bus. WTF happened to Vegas? They just decided not to go? This is where I expected all crazy, fun, bachelorette hell to ensue, and we got nothing. They just went HOME? Seriously? They wasted the funny cast and great possibilities to make this movie awesome. Also what happened with the failed bakery? Why keep showing it and incorporating it into the plot, when nothing will be done with it. I assumed the cop (who had an invested interest in the bakery for some reason) would buy it, Annie would reopen it, and they would live happily ever after. That whole plot idea was tossed aside or simply lost on the cutting room floor. I feel like I didn't get to see the WHOLE movie. Like I went for popcorn and missed huge sections of the plot. I liked the Annie character a lot, but the movie was supposed to be an ensemble cast. They was no real development or use of the secondary characters. They were hysterical!!

Yes, women can be just as gross as men.  However, I did not feel that equaled a hilarious romp to the alter a la The Hangover.  In general I knew what would happen when, so there was little to surprise me in the storytelling.  While there are some girly moments and an entirely predictable ending, I did find some things to laugh at and enjoy.

With Bridesmaids I had heard of it and it was getting good buzz so it was on my list of movies to eventually see.  I let it drag on and on because I'm not a fan chick flicks so to speak.  I thought, ""Oh another movie about a bunch of women pining over some fairy tale with lame cliches.""  Boy was I wrong, this movie is the equivalent to ""The Hangover"" except its with women.  Thus proving that women can be equally fraternizing, comedic and intoxicated as the fellas in ""The Hangover"".  Kristen Wiig plays the protagonist Annie with a fantastic performance that takes you back to the Lucille Ball slapstick days, but put here today in modern times.  I almost want to go out on a limb and say that this may be more of a film for guys.  Never mind that it's all women in the leads of the film, don't let that turn you off guys, as the humor is downright crude, almost repulsive and crass.  Women who are seeing this hoping for a sweet, romantic love story will be sorely disappointed and maybe even turned off.  This isn't to stereotype men and women as I'm simply generalizing that the Bridesmaids title with all female leads can suggest to someone this is another kind of film.  It most definitely is not.

So I figured, hey, even if it's a movie about women getting married, what the heck.  I will never make that mistake again.  No offense, ladies, but female comedians aren't that funny.  Even a lot of so-called funny guys are horrible, but seriously, this is some boring stuff.  Kristen Wiig is good at one thing, which she did in ""Knocked Up"": she's good at playing a stiff white woman who throws out random pleasantries and tries to fit into society.  But that's all.  She can't carry a movie and neither can anyone else in this movie.  Guys don't care about seeing her mental battle with her arch-nemesis over who gets to be Maya Rudolph's BFF.  That's female drama for you.  And the scene where they are trying on wedding dresses and start having diarrhea and vomit?  That's not funny.  It's hard to explain why ""Blazing Saddles"" was funny with a bunch of guys sitting around a campfire and farting but this wasn't, but for some reason I don't want to see a woman taking a dump in a sink.  Or anywhere else.  OK, ladies?  I don't want to see women throwing up on each other in a bathroom.  It's just not entertaining for a guy.  The only halfway decent scene was where the guy cop felt sorry for Wiig's character and was commiserating with her about her failed bakery -- it wasn't funny, but it was feel-good and the guy seemed like a cool dude.  That was literally the only interesting part of the movie.  If you're a guy, never watch this unwatchable mess.  It sucks.  I gave it two stars out of pity.

It's a nice counterbalance to all the male-centric movies out there. There is one gross-out scene, and I did wince and cover my eyes at that, but some people like that humor, and so why not have women doing it for a change (we have bodily functions too after all!!)

The story doesn't know where it wants to go. The poster/cover makes it appear as though it's about a group of bridesmaids and their wacky adventures, but in truth it's mainly a story centered around the maid of honor. The conflict is that she's down on her luck, and feels like she's being replaced as the bride's best friend by one of the other bridesmaids - an overly cheerful, slightly two-faced, rich woman. The other three bridesmaids hardly feature, which is a shame, since they were the more interesting characters.About halfway through the film, it seems as though the action is going to pick up as the gang boards a plane to Vegas, however, they all end up getting kicked off the plane, and take a bus back home. What happened to Vegas?? Apparently they ditched those plans. It's these weird plot detours that make me wonder why the movie couldn't just choose a plot and stick with it.The adventures of the mismatched bridesmaids in Vegas, or anywhere really, would have been much more interesting than watching the main character/maid of honor mope around their small town. She begins to get increasingly hard to like as she pushes just about everyone in her life away, including the nice town cop who has taken an interest in her. She gets kicked out of her apartment, she's rude to her customers at work, trashes a bridal shower, and acts totally irrational. She only ""saves the day"" in the end when she has to talk the bride back into going to the wedding when she gets cold feet.Add this to the fact that nothing in the film is particularly clever or funny. The restaurant she chooses makes everyone sick (in a particularly disgusting sequence of vomit and other bodily fluids). She gets drunk on the plane and acts like an idiot. Her roommates are fat, English morons. She has a ""friend with benefits"" who is (surprise-surprise) a total jerk. The funniest bit was a scene almost at the end of the film where she tries to get the attention of the nice cop she rejected earlier by breaking traffic laws, but even that wasn't enough to save the film.All in all, I greatly disliked it, and am baffled by the amount of people who think it's great.

However, Bridesmaids is a film that is simply too good to be ignored. The reason for this is because it so easily could have been a bad movie. It could have been fake, and unrealistic, it could have featured paper-thin characters with no depth. It could have had a lousy script, with PG-13-friendly antics and adventures. It could've featured ridiculous product placement, and could have involved no realistic conflict, with an even more unrealistic conclusion.However, it really doesn't do any of these things.Bridesmaids has a great line of actresses that make the cut, in every possible way, and proves that women can truly be funny, instead of portraying them, as they easily could have, as whiny bitches. Kristen Wiig is a comedic genius. She co-writes the script, alongside Annie Mumolo (who appears in the film as a jittery passenger on a plane, look for her), and these two ladies bring a hell of alot to the table.Kristen Wiig, while having written a beautifully nuanced script that's funny, yet relatable, and therefore, a bit sad, is the star of the show here. She plays Annie, a lovelorn, broke, and generally unhappy woman whose best friend is getting married, and asks her to be the maid of honor. Whilst dealing with the bizarre and expensive rituals that come with that duty, her life begins to unravel. Friends, love, work, and life, in general begin to blur, and the mistakes of her past become full circle. She's a genuine character, she's not a cliche. As are the rest of the woman in this terrific film.Maya Rudolph (another SNL favourite) plays Wiig's best friend Lillian, who's in the middle of planning a wedding, and begins to drift from her lifelong best friend, Annie. Rose Byrne (who I love in Damages) has a surprisingly apparent comedic side, playing Helen, a member of the bridal party, who is Lillian's fianc&eacute;e's boss's wife (or something like that), and she is essentially the woman who's (possibly inadvertently) trying to destroy Annie and Lillian's friendship.Wendi McLendon-Covey (of Reno 911! fame), gives a hilariously deadpan performance as Rita, a relative who is sarcastic, embittered, and generally dissatisfied in her marriage and resents her three sons. She clicks with Becca (Ellie Kemper, of The Office), a newlywed, who is extremely enthusiastic about becoming a wife and mother, who claims to have been ""so distraught"" when she was single.Rounding out the bridal party is Melissa McCarthy (of Gilmore Girls, and now Mike & Molly) as Megan, the groom's sister. She's the oddball of the group, being decidedly more rough-around-the-edges as the rest of the ladies. While she appears to be for this movie, what Zach Gilifinakis was in The Hangover, she is given room, as are the rest of the ladies, to make exciting, complex, and rewarding characters. But McCarthy is probably the funniest one of the bunch.It's already being referred to as the woman's answer to ""The Hangover"", or ""Hangover in Heels"", which I don't agree with. First of all, I didn't really like ""The Hangover"". For me, it was impossible to root for those four ass-wipes who weren't genuine, and felt cliched and ridiculous. While this film certainly has its crude sequences, it's more about friendship, and how to react to things that happen in life that are not ideal. It's about how a friendship can survive whatever punches that are thrown at it.The fact that each of these ladies are given room to make great characters makes this film as good as it is. Given that they don't really whine, and they prove that women ARE funny, and can be hilarious, sets it apart from any other film like this, that has been made in the last decade. It also sets the bar for any R-rated American comedy to be released in 2011.

This is a 'chick flick', but it has sex, vomiting, and explosive crapping in it. However, none of this is shown in graphic detail like you would see in a 'guy flick', you do not see any throwing up or any gross bits, all of it is covered up, and that was what made it funny without being gross (and the reason behind the vomiting and etc are plausible)However, I did not like how the movie ended, it started off very strong but ended on a somewhat weak note.

I really liked it, even though maybe my judgement was tarnished because I watched it with a horde of cackling women. (I am a man...technically)I think the main one (Kirstin Wiig) is particulalry adorable, and bears the rare gift of being hilarious and indeed female. Hell, even her name makes me lol like there's no tomorrow! She is a great comic actress of the old school, and does provide many laugh out loud moments during the film.Maybe it's too coarse for some? Wouldnt have thought so in this day and age though. Street defecation, repulsive sexual fetishes and coarse language (even the C word lmao) all abound in this film so not your average chick-flick. Viewer discretion should be advised!The casting is inspired,they got some quality British actors like the guy from IT crowd and the fat bald one who looks like an egg but upside down from Little Britain, and was fun to see Jon 'the ham' Hamm in a more comedic role than his usual sultry one. Pretty much the entire cast provided gigglesworthy moments at some point.So don't listen to anyone else's reviews.

Sex and the City fans would wonder how something like this could accelerate at all. If this movie did not include a couple of laughs centering on the ""Officer of the Law"" and an airplane segment, I would predict many more comments of a negative nature than are here at present.This movie does no justice to American movies whatsoever and I would definitely warn lovers of European movies of any genre to well give this one a very big miss.

1386921,APNLFE7D7ZQZA,B00466HN7M,MelissaT.,"[10, 19]","I, like many others, was duped into watching this drivel after reading the glowing reviews on several film sites & also falling prey to the critics' glowing reviews. (Et tu, Ebert?!)I do not go to movie theaters as I find them overpriced, crowded with insane twits who would rather text & talk on their cells then enjoy the film they paid to watch and generally a bad experience all around. Rather, I rent films either through Amazon or Netflix.After talking my boyfriend into watching Bridesmaids (again, because of the reviews), we sat back waiting for some laughs. They never came. In fact, about 10 minutes into the film he said 'What the hell is this crap?' and the rest was history.Kristin Wiig is a terrible actress (apparently writer, too.) She is great at playing the low self-esteem, down on her luck type character but she is ALWAYS Kristin Wiig, in every one of her performances. How sad that she brought the ever-funny Maya Rudolph down in flames with her.We made it to the bridal store scene before I finally stopped the show. We didn't laugh, we didn't feel sorry (or any other emotion for that matter) for any of the characters and we certainly didn't find what others found so appealing.Before the Bridesmaids fan-wagon attacks this review I feel I should point out that I am not a prude or a ""conservative Christian"" as one commenter said ""all the negative people"" who criticized this film were. I enjoyed the Hangover, Old School, 40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, etc., etc., etc. This movie wasn't even in the same realm & frankly I could care less if the characters had been female or male; the film just plain sucks!Do yourselves a favor, folks. Tread with caution. I'm not gonna say to save your money, or to not watch this at all. Everyone out there has their own sense of humor & style & just because I hated this doesn't mean everyone else will. Just know that you have been warned & when you walk away feeling angry at wasting your precious time & angry to have seen such a waste of film & resources, know that there are like-minded people out there sharing your pain.I must end saying what a shame Hollywood has become. Tossing stories that have genuine laughs, characters & development out the window only to allow garbage like this all because of the name behind it is truly depressing.",1,Can it get any worse?,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,2315,"['many', 'others', 'was', 'duped', 'watching', 'drivel', 'reading', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'several', 'film', 'sites', 'also', 'falling', 'prey', 'critics', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'Et', 'tu', 'Ebert', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'movie', 'theaters', 'find', 'overpriced', 'crowded', 'insane', 'twits', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'text', 'talk', 'cells', 'then', 'enjoy', 'film', 'paid', 'watch', 'generally', 'bad', 'experience', 'around', 'Rather', 'rent', 'films', 'Amazon', 'Netflix.After', 'talking', 'boyfriend', 'watching', 'Bridesmaids', 'again', 'reviews', 'sat', 'back', 'waiting', 'laughs', 'never', 'came', 'fact', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'said', ""'What"", 'hell', 'crap', 'rest', 'was', 'history.Kristin', 'Wiig', 'terrible', 'actress', 'apparently', 'writer', 'too', 'great', 'playing', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'down', 'luck', 'type', 'character', 'ALWAYS', 'Kristin', 'Wiig', 'one', 'performances', 'How', 'sad', 'brought', 'ever-funny', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'down', 'flames', 'her.We', 'made', 'bridal', 'store', 'scene', 'finally', 'stopped', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'other', 'emotion', 'matter', 'characters', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'what', 'others', 'found', 'so', 'appealing.Before', 'Bridesmaids', 'fan-wagon', 'attacks', 'review', 'feel', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'prude', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'one', 'commenter', 'said', 'negative', 'people', 'who', 'criticized', 'film', 'were', 'enjoyed', 'Hangover', 'Old', 'School', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'etc', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'same', 'realm', 'frankly', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'female', 'male', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'sucks', 'Do', 'favor', 'folks', 'Tread', 'caution', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'na', 'say', 'save', 'money', 'not', 'watch', 'Everyone', 'there', 'own', 'sense', 'humor', 'style', 'just', 'hated', ""n't"", 'mean', 'everyone', 'else', 'will', 'Just', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'when', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'angry', 'wasting', 'precious', 'time', 'angry', 'have', 'seen', 'waste', 'film', 'resources', 'know', 'are', 'like-minded', 'people', 'there', 'sharing', 'pain.I', 'must', 'end', 'saying', 'what', 'shame', 'Hollywood', 'become', 'Tossing', 'stories', 'have', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'characters', 'development', 'window', 'only', 'allow', 'garbage', 'name', 'truly', 'depressing']",N/A

1386930,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B00466HN7M,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[1, 1]","There's a reason the Golden Globes nominated this film for Best Comedy and Best Actress to Kristin Wiig (who also was one of the writers and by the way the Academy Awards nominated said script for Best Screenplay). At first you think it's another romantic comedy sold as the ""female hangover"" but if was just that then why has it received so many nominations and walked away with a few, too?Quite simply the tale has depth and nuances that many female romantic comedies can never hope to attain. I don't wish to give spoilers in the tale so I'll avoid talking about specific scenes that will break the movie enjoyment.Tale focuses upon a woman named Annie Walker (played by Kristin Wiig), who recently lost her bakery to the Great Recession (she works a crap sales job now) and is in the works to realizing that her current boyfriend (played by John Hamms) only wants a sexual relationship. Things get worse as she realizes she cannot meet the rent and even worse her best friend is getting married and planning a huge celebration of it and oh this best friend brings in another friend who threatens Annie in several ways. Did I mention her roomies are amusing yet creepy, too? Heh.Even though it's a comedy there are serious questions that roll with it. What do relatively intelligent people do when their business fails during the Great Recession? How far should a friend go in helping a depressed friend especially when the former is busy preparing for her wedding? How much do you help a depressed friend before you have to call them on reveling in their victim mentality? How much of one's depression is self destructive and only makes matters worse?Sometimes you wince at the painful moments but more often you're laughing because there are some great moments. Look for the Ethel Merman reference on the plane and the special dance when the police dude thinks she is intoxicated. I especially liked at the end when she tried to incite the cop dude (played by Chris O'Dowd) by breaking every law possible as he tried to pretend he did not care.

El-Hewie""","[4, 7]","This is a true American piece of art, characterized by the strong will to criticize ill traits by the least powerful citizens. The least here was a middle class woman struggling with employment, love, separation from her senile mother, and her inability to secure basic living needs. She was being used as sex object by a male wolf, pushed out of her shared residence by similarly struggling aliens who could not afford to pay their share of the rent. Her experience with the abusive male partner tainted her views of all males and rendered her skeptical from people in general. That was the main character that represents the majority of the American people, split between hard social choices and equally tough financial challenges.The main character will then shine in an educational criticism of fellow females whose ill traits served no good cause. The moviemaker chose a not very attractive bride to demonstrate the vanities of squandering money in social setting that strained the financial situation of the family beyond any good reason. The wedding arrangement of such not very attractive female extended from female bachelor party that ended in food poisoning, to group travel to Las Vegas that ended to detention and arrest of the main character, to an extravagant shower party that ended in manic episode of destruction and upset, etc.Along the many events stretched through the wedding arrangement, the underlying struggles of main character are compared to the ongoing vanities of the wedding events.The choice of characters was flawless, and the comparative alternation between the substantial human struggle with basic living needs versus the nonsensical waste of squandering money on nonessential formalities, luxury, food, dress, and travel,was brilliant.The movie started with provocative sexual play, followed by female sexual innuendo that might have been thrown in there based on a money making decision, it yet excludes the movie from being used as an educational material to younger age groups.",5,"Well balanced comedy, drama, education, and politics.",1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,2017,"['true', 'American', 'piece', 'art', 'characterized', 'strong', 'will', 'criticize', 'ill', 'traits', 'least', 'powerful', 'citizens', 'least', 'here', 'was', 'middle', 'class', 'woman', 'struggling', 'employment', 'love', 'separation', 'senile', 'mother', 'inability', 'secure', 'basic', 'living', 'needs', 'was', 'being', 'used', 'sex', 'object', 'male', 'wolf', 'pushed', 'shared', 'residence', 'similarly', 'struggling', 'aliens', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'pay', 'share', 'rent', 'experience', 'abusive', 'male', 'partner', 'tainted', 'views', 'males', 'rendered', 'skeptical', 'people', 'general', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'majority', 'American', 'people', 'split', 'hard', 'social', 'choices', 'equally', 'tough', 'financial', 'challenges.The', 'main', 'character', 'will', 'then', 'shine', 'educational', 'criticism', 'fellow', 'females', 'ill', 'traits', 'served', 'good', 'cause', 'moviemaker', 'chose', 'not', 'very', 'attractive', 'bride', 'demonstrate', 'vanities', 'squandering', 'money', 'social', 'setting', 'strained', 'financial', 'situation', 'family', 'good', 'reason', 'wedding', 'arrangement', 'such', 'not', 'very', 'attractive', 'female', 'extended', 'female', 'bachelor', 'party', 'ended', 'food', 'poisoning', 'group', 'travel', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'ended', 'detention', 'arrest', 'main', 'character', 'extravagant', 'shower', 'party', 'ended', 'manic', 'episode', 'destruction', 'upset', 'many', 'events', 'stretched', 'wedding', 'arrangement', 'underlying', 'struggles', 'main', 'character', 'are', 'compared', 'ongoing', 'vanities', 'wedding', 'events.The', 'choice', 'characters', 'was', 'flawless', 'comparative', 'alternation', 'substantial', 'human', 'struggle', 'basic', 'living', 'needs', 'versus', 'nonsensical', 'waste', 'squandering', 'money', 'nonessential', 'formalities', 'luxury', 'food', 'dress', 'travel', 'was', 'brilliant.The', 'movie', 'started', 'provocative', 'sexual', 'play', 'followed', 'female', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'based', 'money', 'making', 'decision', 'yet', 'movie', 'being', 'used', 'educational', 'material', 'younger', 'age', 'groups']",N/A

Much has been made of the fact that this film is for the girls what the celebrated Judd Apatow movies are for the boys.  It's true.  In fact Apatow is a producer.  While there is plenty of in-your-face humor related to sex and bathroom mishaps, the best stuff is more subtle and will produce chuckles rather than guffaws.  In fact, the two 20 year old dudes sitting behind me at a theater viewing clearly didn't get the jokes.  Wiig is terrific as the best friend of the bride (Maya Rudolph) who has found a new friend who wants to control everything.  She's played by Rose Byrne as you've never seen here before...damn funny.  While everyone has their moments, the best character is chubby Megan, the sister of the groom and played with great vigor by Melissa McCarthy.  I could have done without the vomit and diarrhea scene as the ladies were trying on dresses, but hell I was laughing.

But cut me some slack here - my wife got the movie as a gift and wanted to watch it with me.  So I bit the bullet.It pretty much sucked.  It wasn't the worst movie I've seen - there were some funny parts and we watched it all the way through.  However, the good parts were overshadowed by the overall worthlessness of the film.The plot it basically this - a spoiled rotten women is getting married and she invites an ""old"" friend and a ""new"" friend to stand up for her in the wedding.  The old friend is the maid of honor.  The film is about how the old and new friend turn the wedding planning and preparation process into a big `ol fight.There are almost no likeable characters in this film.  The main character is the ""old"" friend who is initially named the maid of honor - I think her name is Annie, but I don't recall.  The chic is psychotic, sleeps with men who treat her like garbage, can't hold down a job, and has no money so she spends most of her time trying to make the wedding as cheap as possible.On the other side, we have the ""new"" friend - who spends her time trying to prove that she is a better friend to the bride than the old friend.  She is the ""perfect"" girl, while Annie is the ""flawed"" girl.  Blah, blah, blah... In other words, 90% of this film is about the fight between these two selfish and self-destructive nags.Then we have the bride herself - who is worthless.  She doesn't do much of anything except complain.  And why not really?  Isn't that what we teach women now?  That a wedding is nothing but a license to spoil yourself, overspend, and complain?  What does the groom say about this?  Nothing of course - the dude is barely in the film at all.There is another bridesmaid who does nothing the entire film but whine about her kids and her husband.  We also have the ""innocent"" bridesmaid - a character with some potential, but she never gets developed.  Her role as the ""innocent"" girl is to listen to stories and get ruined by the ""used up and jaded"" girl.Finally, there is the ""fat girl"" bridesmaid who plays the part of comedy relief.  I actually thought this was the only good character in the film.So what does this group of hags accomplish?  Well, nothing really.  They try to have some fun, but the fighting keeps throwing the wheels off the cart.  For example, they decide to fly to Vegas for a party, only to force the plane down early when Annie gets high on medication (which was given to her by her revival - the brides ""new friend).The next scene takes place on a bus - which I thought was continuing on the Vegas.  Nope!  The got on a bus and turned around and went home.  What the heck?I've heard a lot of comparison between this film and The Hangover.  Seriously?  The Hangover is a comedy about a bunch of guys having fun.  On the other hand, Bridesmaids is about a group of rotten women who self-destruct and, in the process, screw up the whole wedding planning process as well.Personally, I think this film would have been much better if the women actually did some things, got in some trouble, had some fun, etc.  Instead, we get a couple hours of personal problems, complaining, and jealousy.  Is this what passes for female entertainment these days?  I thought it was just annoying.My wife thought that Annie's new love interest was an ok guy - the ""nice guy"" cop who treats her good.  But of course, she blows the relationship up because she is used to being treated like crap so she runs away from a nice guy, etc, etc, etc.  I though the guy was a tool.  Dude - the chic is obviously a head case and you take her back?  What the heck is wrong with you?  The guy deserves what he gets for dating that train wreck.As a side note, have you noticed that EVERY show about a group of girls is based on a handful of generic models?  The main character is the ""dreamer"" girl, then you have the innocent girl, slutty girl, professional girl, fat girl, etc.  The plot typically involves the characters' problems, insecurities, jealousy, blah...blah...blah.  Every show or movie also ends with a sappy song.",2,Blah...blah...blah...blah...blah,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,4172,"['Yeah', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'can', 'hear', 'Moondonkey', 'What', 'heck', 'are', 'doing', 'watching', 'Bridesmaids', 'know', 'cut', 'slack', 'here', 'wife', 'got', 'movie', 'gift', 'wanted', 'watch', 'So', 'bit', 'bullet.It', 'pretty', 'much', 'sucked', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'were', 'funny', 'parts', 'watched', 'way', 'However', 'good', 'parts', 'were', 'overshadowed', 'overall', 'worthlessness', 'film.The', 'plot', 'basically', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'women', 'getting', 'married', 'old', 'friend', 'new', 'friend', 'stand', 'up', 'wedding', 'old', 'friend', 'maid', 'honor', 'film', 'how', 'old', 'new', 'friend', 'turn', 'wedding', 'planning', 'preparation', 'process', 'big', 'ol', 'fight.There', 'are', 'almost', 'likeable', 'characters', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'initially', 'named', 'maid', 'honor', 'think', 'name', 'Annie', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'chic', 'psychotic', 'sleeps', 'men', 'who', 'treat', 'like', 'garbage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'money', 'so', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'make', 'wedding', 'as', 'cheap', 'possible.On', 'other', 'side', 'have', 'new', 'friend', 'who', 'time', 'trying', 'prove', 'better', 'friend', 'bride', 'old', 'friend', 'perfect', 'girl', 'Annie', 'flawed', 'girl', 'Blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'other', 'words', '90', '%', 'film', 'fight', 'two', 'selfish', 'self-destructive', 'nags.Then', 'have', 'bride', 'who', 'worthless', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'complain', 'why', 'not', 'really', ""n't"", 'what', 'teach', 'women', 'now', 'wedding', 'nothing', 'license', 'spoil', 'overspend', 'complain', 'What', 'groom', 'say', 'Nothing', 'course', 'dude', 'barely', 'film', 'all.There', 'bridesmaid', 'who', 'nothing', 'entire', 'film', 'whine', 'kids', 'husband', 'also', 'have', 'innocent', 'bridesmaid', 'character', 'potential', 'never', 'developed', 'role', 'innocent', 'girl', 'listen', 'stories', 'get', 'ruined', 'used', 'up', 'jaded', 'girl.Finally', 'fat', 'girl', 'bridesmaid', 'who', 'part', 'comedy', 'relief', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'character', 'film.So', 'what', 'group', 'hags', 'accomplish', 'Well', 'nothing', 'really', 'try', 'have', 'fun', 'fighting', 'keeps', 'throwing', 'wheels', 'cart', 'example', 'decide', 'fly', 'Vegas', 'party', 'only', 'force', 'plane', 'down', 'early', 'when', 'Annie', 'high', 'medication', 'was', 'given', 'revival', 'brides', 'new', 'friend', '.The', 'next', 'scene', 'place', 'bus', 'thought', 'was', 'continuing', 'Vegas', 'Nope', 'got', 'bus', 'turned', 'around', 'went', 'home', 'What', 'heck', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'comparison', 'film', 'Hangover', 'Seriously', 'Hangover', 'comedy', 'bunch', 'guys', 'having', 'fun', 'other', 'hand', 'Bridesmaids', 'group', 'rotten', 'women', 'who', 'self-destruct', 'process', 'screw', 'up', 'whole', 'wedding', 'planning', 'process', 'well.Personally', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'women', 'actually', 'did', 'things', 'got', 'trouble', 'had', 'fun', 'etc', 'Instead', 'get', 'couple', 'hours', 'personal', 'problems', 'complaining', 'jealousy', 'what', 'female', 'entertainment', 'days', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'annoying.My', 'wife', 'thought', 'Annie', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'ok', 'guy', 'nice', 'guy', 'cop', 'who', 'good', 'course', 'relationship', 'up', 'used', 'being', 'treated', 'crap', 'away', 'nice', 'guy', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'guy', 'was', 'tool', 'Dude', 'chic', 'obviously', 'head', 'case', 'take', 'back', 'What', 'heck', 'wrong', 'guy', 'what', 'dating', 'train', 'wreck.As', 'side', 'note', 'have', 'noticed', 'EVERY', 'show', 'group', 'girls', 'based', 'handful', 'generic', 'models', 'main', 'character', 'dreamer', 'girl', 'then', 'have', 'innocent', 'girl', 'slutty', 'girl', 'professional', 'girl', 'fat', 'girl', 'etc', 'plot', 'typically', 'characters', 'problems', 'insecurities', 'jealousy', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Every', 'show', 'movie', 'also', 'sappy', 'song']",N/A

The movie gets billed as groundbreaking and unusual and is widely described as edgy and beyond the usual bounds of the rom-com+grossout genre that has been being mined for decades now. But it's standard fare in all respects, from the writing (you've seen this plot tens of times) and skit-type situations to the characters and underlying ideas and themes. You know how the stories will resolve; you know how the characters will develop. Many of the performances are fantastic -- Wiig, Rudolph, and Byrne are amazing -- but other characters are only halfway there and the actresses who play them are wasted. I did not find the film ""hilarious"" (as so many claim); it was generally funny, sometimes very funny, but as with every aspect of the film, even the comedy underperformed. I think the responsibility goes directly to director Feig, as the material, premise, and cast are full of promise but hardly used to best advantage. Example: When Maya Rudolph, who is an amazing performer of both characters and physical comedy, has her character pooping in the street underneath the wedding dress she is trying on, it's funny and gross, as it's meant to be, but that incident is shot abnd edited so poorly that what could have been a blizzard of images of a great comic actress in a spectacularly funny/gross incident is most just shown from mid-distance. You get the idea, you sort of laugh, but what could and should have been a larger scene providing an infinitely greater number of ""hilarious"" shots never gets beyond a ""Porky's""-style sequence. Sure, I liked it, but I can't help feeling that the material and cast could have been treated with a whole lot more effect by the director.

The delivery of her lines proves that she has unequaled comedic timing, and it was when she came on screen that the movie turned around.The film has 1 major flaw: it seemed that no one told Kristen Wiig that this was a comedy, so the film seemed to lurch along at times, trying to decide if it was a comedy or a drama, while Kristen Wiig opted to portray Annie as a hyper-excitable and manic Tina Fey SNL character. It didn't work for me. Characters were painted with too broad a stroke and there was very little character development.  McCarthy took a part that could have been played as a buffoon and turned it into the part that 'stole the show'. Unfortunately, at times it seemed that Paul Feig (the director) seemed to be cowed by Kristen Wiig's role as co-producer and was unable to control Kristen Wiig the actorThat said, this was truly a funny movie. I rarely laugh out loud at comedies, but this movie had me laughing as hard as I have ever laughed. It is definitely worth watching this if you crave an evening of laughter. I bought the disc and am glad I did. I expect to watch this many more times.

The film focuses on the downward spiral of Annie (Kristen Wiig) as her best friend Lil (Maya Rudolph) plans her wedding and names Annie as maid-of-honor.  Annie had a bakery that tanked and now she is forced to work at a jewelry store and live with an extremely creepy British brother & sister in a cramped apartment.  She degrades herself by sleeping with Ted (Jon Hamm) who is more than upfront about the relationship being just about hooking up.  In the meantime, she gets into a competition with Lil's new friend Helen (Rose Byrne) on who is really Lil's best friend and running the wedding.  Along the way she falls for an Irish cop Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) with whom she can't really commit.  Lil's future sister-in-law Megan (Melissa McCarthy) adds the most comedic relief as an in your face, over sexed woman who seduces an undercover air marshal on an aborted trip to Las Vegas.  While Ms. McCarthy has been garnering much deserved praise for her portrayal of Megan, it is Ms. Wiig who is the heart & soul of the film.  Watching Annie slide further and further into depression and misery could be painful, but Ms. Wiig handles it with just the right touch to where you feel sorry for Annie but she stops short of becoming completely pitiful.  There a far too numerous hysterical scenes to detail, although the trip to an exclusive bridal shop stands out.

A fine ensemble cast mainly features 4 actresses: Wiig, Rudolph, Byrne & McCarthy. All are fine. The DVD I watched had no extras, which is a drag, because I wanted to know more about how director Paul Feig put it all together with such precision.Unless you're a complete curmudgeon, I don't know how you won't be entertained by this film about how regular people like you and I show their vulnerability and humanness.

1387001,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00466HN7M,Robert Badgley,"[8, 19]","I got my advanced copy of Bridesmaids(theatrically released May/11),through a store which mistakenly released it too early,anticipating great things according to all the hype and reviews on it,and of course the big bonanza at the box office.Boy was I disappointed;gags that a one year old could see coming even before the movie rolled.It stars Kristen Wiig as Annie who also co wrote the screenplay along with Annie Mumolo.Jill Clayburgh who I hadn't seen for far too long plays Annies mother.It is a shame she passed away late last year before the movie even opened as she gave as best a performance as she could considering the inane material given to her.There is even an outtake where one actress apologizes for making her having to say the lines that she does.Add to this,in Canada at least,a terrible layer change hesitation on the disc,the length of which I've never encountered.Anyways on with the plot.It involves the aforementioned Annie who had a bakery business that went bust and like the business,her romance department is in equal doldrums.She is going with a self absorbed twit named Ted(John Hamm) and she lives with two totally off the wall characters by the names of Gil(Matt Lucas) and his sister Brynn(Rebel Wilson).Thrown into the mix is Annie's life long friend Lillian(Maya Rudolph)who is getting married and Annie is picked as her maid of honour.One of Lllian's bridesmaids Helen(Rose Byrne) doesn't see eye to eye with Annie and the two from the get go pick at each other and try to out do each other at every turn.Helen is married to a well off banker exec so she can afford the luxuries to throw Lillian's way and at the same time impress the heck out of everyone else.Things just go steadily downhill for Annie who manages to get everyone sick at a restaurant they eat at and on a flight to Vegas for the bachelorette party she becomes drunk(in big part due to Helen's advice)and gets the plane diverted to Wyoming.Back home Annie flirts with and eventually sleeps with a local Irish born cop named Nathan(Chris Dowd).However due to the stress of everything she shy's away from getting too deep and backs off any further personal interaction.Annie travels to Chicago to attend her friends bridal shower only to find that Helen has stolen the very Parisian theme she had envisioned for it.When Helen offers to take Lillian to Paris for a dress fitting with the designer himself she melts down and trashes much of the table settings and leaves.Annie is banned from the wedding by Lillian.On the way home Annie's car breaks down,and that being the final straw,she retreats into her apartment.Fellow bridesmaid Megan(Melissa Mccarthy)comes around and gives Annie some much needed advice and gets her out of her depression.Annie bakes a cake to makes amends to the cop but it remains on the doorstep where she left it.Helen then shows up saying Lillian has disappeared but also apologizes for her behavior towards her.The search for Lillian ends at her apartment and the two reconcile.Annie is reinstated as the top bridesmaid and the wedding goes off without a hitch,with Nathan arriving on the scene to also reconcile with Annie.Some of the best moments in this movie come from the unexpected places and not necessarily from its' two main characters.Melissa Mccarthy plays the over weight but plucky and steadfast friend/bridesmaid and she is given some worthwhile moments on the flight to Vegas and her heart to heart with Annie.The brother and sister Annie live with are almost alien like and quite creepy but so off the wall that you have to shake your head more than once.Ben Falcone as the ""no I'm not an Air Marshall"" gives an understated but decent performance,as does Franklyn Ajaye as Lillian's dad.And watch for a brief appearance by Terry Crews who played Gerard Butler's nemesis in the great action film Gamer.However over all the so called gags are strained and quite,QUITE shallow.It starts from the very beginning where Annie is leaving Ted's place and the motorized gate is closed.Of course this wouldn't happen in real life as it would be obvious the gate would have to get opened in order for her to leave,but yes I know,this is just a movie.Who couldn't see that once she climbed that gate to get over it,it would somehow open with her on it? We then find Annie talking sexual humour with her friend Lillian...whoopee.The scenes where the bridesmaids get sick is quite gross and WAY too obvious.Her roommate Byrne is on the big side and when she shows Annie her tattoo on her back of course this is time to show all the fat folds and the butt crack...been there,done that.*yawn*.Chris Dowd's lackluster performance as Nathan is no where near believable,so I cannot suspend my disbelief long enough to believe why a good looking lady like that would ever fall for a milk toast guy like Natahan. Annie and Helen's attempts at getting Nathan's attention by her constant driving by his squad car are just plain childish stuff and very unfunny.And Wiig's over all performance as Annie is far from ingratiating.It's underplayed too much and the spark just is not there.Technically speaking the film is in its a/r of 2:40:1 and the picture is clear and crisp.This release comes with the theatrical version and the unrated version.There are deleted scenes,extended and alternate ones,a gag reel,commentary and more.There is also(at least in the Canadian release) a terrible layer change hesitation.The scene goes from Nathan and Annie sleeping together to a shot of Annie laying on the bed.I counted at least an eight second hesitation which is the longest I have ever encountered.The disc I checked and it is pristine.This is obviously a manufacturing error and not as a result of a disc scratch or film flaw.Universal take note.All in all a disappointing movie from this reviewers perspective.The humour is oft times of the toilet brand and quite juvenile,so shallow you can see through it and it is telegraphed way,way ahead.It's the old ""when you can't think of something smart,go for the lowest common denominator"".The main characters did nothing for me but I got the most kicks from the more ""minor"" co stars.If this is your thing then I recommend it but if not put aside all the hype you've heard,save your money and give it a HUGE pass.",2,"Juvenile humour in this ""comedic""yawn fest",1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,6281,"['got', 'advanced', 'copy',

1387006,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00466HN7M,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Given the reviews and the comments by many of those who'd already seen the movie, I was expecting ""Bridesmaids"" to be a bit more of a raucous affair than it ultimately turned out to be. Yet, while it isn't exactly the ""groundbreaking"" film so many people had described it as being, there's enough you-go-girl sassiness and charm to make it a pleasant enough comedic experience.SNL alums, Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig (who co-wrote the screenplay with Annie Mumolo), play best friends from childhood, Lillian and Annie, the former a career-woman who's getting ready to tie the knot with a wealthy banker, and the latter, an insecure bundle of neuroses with commitment issues whom Lillian has asked to be her bridesmaid. Into the breach steps Rose Byrne (Glenn Close's bete noire from TV's ""Damages""), as Lillian's snooty new friend whom Annie sees as a rival for Lillian's affections. The focus of the screenplay is mainly on Annie, as she goes about subconsciously sabotaging many of the traditional pre-wedding festivities, as well as her own chances at happiness.Though the women here are occasionally foul-mouthed and uninhibited in their behavior and topics of conversation, they really aren't as crude and vulgar as the media - looking for a look-even-women-can-be-as-bad as-men storyline - has made them out to be. In fact, the tone of much of the movie is sweet and thoughtful, as Annie copes with her very recognizably human feelings of inferiority and jealousy.Directed by Paul Feig, the movie alternates between broad slapstick and sophisticated satire without skipping a beat, though there is the occasional dry-spot to slow down the proceedings.

1387022,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00466HN7M,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 4]","I always love the notion of women being dubbed ""the fairer sex.""  I've always been raised that a woman can do pretty much anything a man can do, and if my 41 years on this earth have taught me anything, it's that women can be just as crude, boorish and stupid as men.Hollywood seems to forget this, basing far too many of its female characters (especially in comedies) on sterile models of Barbie-esque perfection.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Hollywood has milked the ""funny good guy must steal the bombshell from the rich jerk"" storyline for ages - the object of desire in these movies is invariably given little to do.  (Think Rachel McAdams in ""Wedding Crashers"" - a talented actress does little more than grin and look gorgeous).""Bridesmaids"" takes a refreshing break from tradition by focusing almost exclusively on the ladies.  And these ladies, by and large, do not act like ""ladies,"" but instead are well-rounded, flawed, funny women.  Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph of ""SNL"" fame play lifelong friends who are going on different tracks as they head into their 30s.  Wiig's Annie has her self-esteem in the dumpster after her Milwaukee bakery failed - now she's content to be on the booty call speed dial for a spectacular jerk (Jon Hamm of ""Mad Men"").  Rudolph's Lillian, on the other hand, has gotten engaged to a successful guy in Chicago and she seems destined for a life of country clubs and European vacations.Both friends understand they are growing apart, so Lillian asks Annie to be her maid of honor, naturally.  Annie is thrilled, only to be horrified that Lillian's future sister-in-law appears to be all-too-eager to become Lillian's new best friend.  This harpy, Helen, played with WASPy evil by Rose Byrne, is everything that Annie is not - rich, poised, and (seemingly) self-assured.  What ensues is a traditional battle royale between Annie and Helen as they vie for the role of maid of honor.  Thanks to the other bridesmaids, including Megan (Melissa McCarthy) and Rita (Wendi McLendon Covey of ""Reno 911""), this is a battle spiced with raunchy humor and replete with poetic profanity.  These are good things.I must admit that I came to ""Bridesmaids"" late, after all the hype and Oscar nominations.  Ultimately I can't say that this is a great comedy - it is genuinely funny and has a few laugh-out-loud moments, and it definitely has a heart.  But all I've heard is that ""'Bridesmaids' is the new 'Hangover.'""  That just flat-out isn't true - even despite the great comic performance by Melissa McCarthy as Megan, there is nothing in ""Bridesmaids"" that is as original as ""The Hangover,"" if only because there is nothing in this movie that approaches the comic genius of Zach Galifianakis.  (Perhaps if Wendi McLendon Covey had been given a little more to do - she inexplicably gets no lines in the second half of the movie.  The lady is comic gold.)Definitely a solid comic effort - something that is all too rare these days - and an enjoyable reminder that women can do far more in a comedy than be the sterile object of desire.

Plain and simple, it was a funny film but since I do not write summaries and opinions on acting, etc which have been done to death here, my review will be solely upon the quality of the release on Blu Ray and my rating is based on that alone.  I do wish that Amazon would separate the Blu Ray reviews from the Instant Download reviews from the Standard DVD reviews as so many have been asking for.VIDEO&#8230;We have an excellent video transfer with no grain or artifacting anywhere.  Color grading is very natural with colors only slightly pumped up in saturation.  I had seen this film before but can't really say that I noticed the additional lines and scenes that were to be added.  The Mbps rate appeared to average in the low twenties.  What you see will often depend upon the quality of the TV monitor you are using as well as the BluRay player.  My monitor is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; with an OPPO 103 player.  I give the video transfer 5 stars.AUDIO&#8230;.This is a dialogue driven film and most all of the action takes place in front of the camera.  While the DTS MA HD 5.1 audio provides clear and transparent dialogue, you cannot expect much, if anything, from your surround speakers or LFE channel.  Except for only a couple of places where cars go by across the front sound stage, there is nothing for your system to do.  Everything comes from your center channel speaker.  Music, however, is nicely spread across the entire front stage and the rears sometimes are muxed to reproduce the same music.  Not much here on the audio front, so just enjoy the film's comedic lines.EXTRAS&#8230;..I really do resent the need for me to pay for advertising of other movies and there are at least 3 previews of other films before you get to the film you just paid for.  These previews are nothing more than advertising and they take up room on the disc calling for more compression of the film itself as demonstrated in the rather low bit rate of the film.The rest of the real 'Extras' are great and are filled with litterally hundreds of cut lines, alternate scenes, deleted scenes ,a 'Making of' documentary, a great Gag reel, and a heck of a lot more.  I don't think I have seen a Blu Ray with so many quality extras.The Standard Def DVD is also supplied as a hard copy along with a redeemable code for downloading to iTunes which I greatly preferred over the Cloud choice.  I had no problems redeeming and downloading to iTunes.All in all, its a fun Blu Ray to own but you wouldn't want to use it as a DEMO disc to show off your system.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.

I like original humor and there is little of that in The Bridesmaids.  The best part of this lamefest was Melissa McCarthy (who stole all the dogs and badgered the cute little guy on the plane into a relationship).  She was awesome! If Hollywood made a movie about her character I might actually spend money to see the film.  The Irish cop was also a pleasant surprise.  He wasn't Hollywood hunk material which was refreshing.

There's the person who's about to get married (with the fiance largely absent), a goofy sibling comes into the picture, with one of the main characters of the film in a lousy relationship. But Bridesmaids stretches the story over a longer period of time and includes more characters (and it packs in way more character development). It's also funnier, even if it is a bit more formulaic and relies somewhat too much on caricatures (like, as gut-bustingly hilarious as they are, main character Annie's screwball roommates, a disgusting brother-sister pair). As interesting as it is to watch Annie's goofy ups and downs, and her fine acting, she does come off as a younger Meg Ryan in the way that, as attractive and likable as she is, she just can't seem to get her life together. Better than all that is the dialogue, which is pretty sassy, especially when it comes to the over-the-top sister of the groom, Meghan, played by Melissa McCarthy, who is a swarthy and raunchy butch chick (her suggestion for a bachelorette party is to do a ladies Fight Club for the young bride). Jill Clayburgh is awesome as Annie's wacky mother; sadly, it was her last film as she died of leukemia in November 2010 (ironically, her first film credit was for The Wedding Party in 1969). As for the plot, it's pretty predictable... but what a ride! Like all comedies, this one also devolves into a few pivotal ""key life lesson scenes"" that are as serious as they are unnecessary (do we really care how and when the bride came to her senses and realised who her true friend really were?), but they are short-ish, and we quickly get back to the hilarity with a dose of...

Some compare to the movie Hangover, which I have not seen, so I can't comment on that.I had not seen much of Kristen Wiig before this movie, but she is extremely captivating to watch. She has great comedic  timing and is very versatile in this role. Her character, Annie, goes through depression, then happiness, then deep anger, then depression, happiness again. Her struggles with her friendship with Lillian is something many women have gone through in their own lives. Annie already feels terrible and like a failure about the direction her life is headed, then her long term friendship with Lillian is tested by a new wanna be friend who is vain and insincere. The best part of the movie is that Wiig's character is honestly and palpably struggling with all aspects of her life, but she still manages to keep moving forward, by behaving honestly (and hilariously), and keeps her faith in trusting her instincts about Lillian's new wanna be friend and her own failures in life.Melissa McCarthy is amazing, as usual. She is a great comedienne and I will watch ANY movie she is in. The scene at the bridal salon is by far the best scene of the movie, she steals this scene 100%. The scene is a bit gross, but it made it all the more real life.

However, I have no problem switching over to crude jokes and physical pratfalls to grace a smile and to induce chuckles.  I really enjoyed ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Horrible Bosses"", hell I still think ""Dumb & Dumber"" is hysterical.  With that being said, I was eager to watch ""Bridesmaids"" since I had heard only great things about it. Well after watching it the only word I can conjure to state my reaction to this film is ""disappointment"".The movie is about a thirty something woman named Annie (Kristen Wig) who is the maid of honor at her best friend Lillian's (Maya Rudolph) wedding.  Annie and Lillian have been friends forever and as of recent their lives have taken different paths.  Lillian has attained a new gal pal Helen (Rose Byrne) and it appears that Annie doesn't really care for Lillian's new friend(s) and new life.  Now take the character of Annie and add some self loathing, neurotic tendencies, callow behavior and absolutely no regard for anyone else and you have the movie in a nut shell.What destroyed this movie for me was the character of Annie.  I found her to be utterly unsympathetic, self-centered, annoying and instigator of her own misery.  A perfect example is the scene involving her and the cop (Chris O'Dowd) and baking supplies.  I am not sure what Kristen Wig was attempting to do with this role, but I couldn't stand the performance.For a movie called ""Bridesmaids"", there really wasn't that much interaction between them.  I was told this was the women's version of ""The Hangover"".  I don't know about that.  ""The Hangover"" was alright, a bit overrated in my humble opinion, but at least there was interaction with the guys in that movie.  In ""Bridesmaids"" it is some interaction with the ladies, Annie being an emotional train wreck, Helen and Annie fighting over Lillian's affection.To be objective, I will say there were a couple funny parts in the movie.  I really liked the scene where everyone became ill while trying on the dresses.  There were also a few funny one liners that also made me laugh.  However, these few moments were overshadowed by forced humor or things that weren't funny at all.  A perfect example was when Annie and Helen kept fighting over the microphone when they were doing their toast for Lillian.  This was one of the longest scenes I have seen in a recent film.  Actually the movie was way too long.  It ran just over two hours and again more than half of it was Annie's pity party. Not to mention there was no atonement or redemption of her character.I watched this movie with my wife and she hated it too.  It was actually a chore to sit through the entire film.  We kept looking at time to see how much time was remaining. Notwithstanding, this film did very well critically and financially.  I was also told by numerous people how amazing it was.  I still think Annie would be a great paradigm for abnormal psychology.",1,"This movie should be called ""Self Loathing & Neurotic Thirty-Something Woman""",1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,3018,"['consider', 'fan', 'low', 'brow', 'humor', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'smart', 'witty', 'humor', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'However', 'have', 'problem', 'switching', 'crude', 'jokes', 'physical', 'pratfalls', 'grace', 'smile', 'induce', 'chuckles', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'hell', 'still', 'think', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'hysterical', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'Bridesmaids', 'had', 'heard', 'only', 'great', 'things', 'Well', 'watching', 'only', 'word', 'can', 'conjure', 'state', 'reaction', 'film', 'disappointment', '.The', 'movie', 'thirty', 'something', 'woman', 'named', 'Annie', 'Kristen', 'Wig', 'who', 'maid', 'honor', 'best', 'friend', 'Lillian', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'wedding', 'Annie', 'Lillian', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'forever', 'recent', 'lives', 'have', 'taken', 'different', 'paths', 'Lillian', 'attained', 'new', 'gal', 'pal', 'Helen', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Annie', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Lillian', 'new', 'friend', 's', 'new', 'life', 'Now', 'take', 'character', 'Annie', 'add', 'self', 'loathing', 'neurotic', 'tendencies', 'callow', 'behavior', 'absolutely', 'regard', 'anyone', 'else', 'have', 'movie', 'nut', 'shell.What', 'destroyed', 'movie', 'was', 'character', 'Annie', 'found', 'be', 'utterly', 'unsympathetic', 'self-centered', 'annoying', 'instigator', 'own', 'misery', 'perfect', 'example', 'scene', 'involving', 'cop', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'baking', 'supplies', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Kristen', 'Wig', 'was', 'attempting', 'do', 'role', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'performance.For', 'movie', 'called', 'Bridesmaids', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'interaction', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'women', 'version', 'Hangover', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Hangover', 'was', 'alright', 'bit', 'overrated', 'humble', 'opinion', 'least', 'was', 'interaction', 'guys', 'movie', 'Bridesmaids', 'interaction', 'ladies', 'Annie', 'being', 'emotional', 'train', 'wreck', 'Helen', 'Annie', 'fighting', 'Lillian', 'affection.To', 'be', 'objective', 'will', 'say', 'were', 'couple', 'funny', 'parts', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'everyone', 'became', 'ill', 'trying', 'dresses', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'funny', 'one', 'liners', 'also', 'made', 'laugh', 'However', 'few', 'moments', 'were', 'overshadowed', 'forced', 'humor', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'perfect', 'example', 'was', 'when', 'Annie', 'Helen', 'kept', 'fighting', 'microphone', 'when', 'were', 'doing', 'toast', 'Lillian', 'was', 'one', 'longest', 'scenes', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'film', 'Actually', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'ran', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'again', 'more', 'half', 'was', 'Annie', 'pity', 'party', 'Not', 'mention', 'was', 'atonement', 'redemption', 'character.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'wife', 'hated', 'too', 'was', 'actually', 'chore', 'sit', 'entire', 'film', 'kept', 'looking', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'remaining', 'Notwithstanding', 'film', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'critically', 'financially', 'was', 'also', 'told', 'numerous', 'people', 'how', 'amazing', 'was', 'still', 'think', 'Annie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'paradigm', 'abnormal', 'psychology']",N/A

1387073,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00466HN7M,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 6]","Annie (Kristen Wiig, TV's ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Knocked-Up, ""MacGruber"") is going through a rough time; her bakery has closed, forcing her to take a job at a jewelers, she has move in with a creepy roommate (Matt Lucas, TV's ""Little Britain"") and his strange sister (Rebel Wilson), and she has a relationship with a rich guy (Jon Hamm) who seems to view her as more of a necessary tool to satisfy his sexual needs. Then, her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph, TV's ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Away We Go"", ""Shrek the Third"") announces she is engaged and wants Annie to be her Maid of Honor. At the engagement party, Annie meets Helen (Rose Byrne, TV's ""Damages""), the wife of Lillian's fianc&eacute;e's boss, and there is an instant competition between them. Because Annie is having such a difficult time with her finances, she tries to bluff her way through the increasingly expensive bridal party arrangements and plans. But the other women are determined to have some fun and spend some money. And every occasion seems marred by some difficulty.Written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig (an actor with many credits and a Judd Apatow prot&eacute;g&eacute;), ""Bridesmaids"" is a funny, funny film. Despite the moments of hilarity, some of which could be considered near brilliant, the film suffers from being too long, by at least a half hour, and this detracts from the overall quality.Wiig is often the bright spot of any ""Saturday Night Live"" episode. The weekend this film opened, she was the star of a skit called ""Ann-Margaret Throws Away A Piece of Trash"". It appeared at the end of the show, but it was a physical, funny and slightly brilliant idea with a dead-on impersonation of Ann-Margaret, circa the late 60s. It was also short. Many of the skits on ""SNL"" suffer because they go on too long. Wiig and Mumolo have written a story to give Wiig's strengths a showcase. There are elements of all of Wiig's memorable characters in Annie and thankfully most have been toned down to make the film more believable and interesting.But many of the scenes play out too long, beyond the funny parts, causing the film to drag. I realize they are trying to make a film about people we might really know, and want to infuse these characters with some humanity, but smaller doses of this world would have made the film seem funnier. It almost seems as though they couldn't decide if they wanted to make a comedy with some raunch, or if they wanted to make a romantic comedy with some funny moments.The movie, produced by Judd Apatow, is being sold as a raunchy-female version of ""Knocked Up"" or ""The Hangover"". It doesn't deliver on this. There is one scene like this, and it's good, but there is just the one sceneAnnie is played with a lot of heart. She and Laurie are great friends and have known each other for years. This is established quickly and allows us to witness this dynamic. When Laurie announces she is engaged, Annie is overjoyed but you can also see she is just a bit jealous. This is the beauty of Wiig. Much like Steve Carrel on ""The Office"", she is able to quickly reveal parts of her character while portraying something very different. When she hears the news, she is overjoyed but a subtle shift in her voice reveals the jealousy, and her competitive edge. Annie has a lot of different facets to her character and Wiig seems to not only embrace these, but to celebrate them.Lillian's fianc&eacute;e lives and works in Chicago, so Annie makes the drive from Milwaukee to attend the lavish engagement party hosted by Helen (Byrne). This is an opportunity for Annie to meet all of Lillian's new friends. But she and Helen instantly begin competing against one another, using an evening toast to try to one-up each other.Given Wiig is the star of the film, she naturally has the lion's share of screen time. But it is nice to see a couple of other characters really stand out. Some stand out for the wrong reasons. As soon as Maya Rudolph's Lillian announces her engagement, she becomes a straight man, trying to remain calm as so many things go wrong. It isn't the flashiest of roles, but it gets the job done. As she begins to take on the responsibility and stress of becoming a bride, her character becomes more and more serious, more of a mediator between Annie and Helen, more of a cheerleader to keep Annie happy.Rose Byrne's Helen is a more complicated creation. She is necessary to provide the catalyst for Annie's insecurities, but if that were all she is, she would quickly become boring. During the engagement party, Annie's first glimpse of Helen seems pulled from a Grace Kelly film; Helen is tall, glamorous and turns towards her (us) in a way that makes Annie realize how pretty she is. Annie is more modest, wearing her best clothes, but they pale in comparison. And she is also dealing with the effects of the long drive, rumpled clothes and hair. Annie can't compete with Helen. When she feels she can, she tries, but Helen will always be able to outspend her. And Helen seems equally determined to compete with Annie for the one thing she can't buy - Lillian's BFF approval. It is nice to see the different levels of this character and the underhanded things she is willing to do to win the day.Even though it is natural, given the narrative conventions, for Lillian to ignore Helen's actions, this helps to make Lillian's character seem more mediocre.When Helen finally comes clean, it seems predictable and a little forced. It seems as though Wiig and Mumolo knew this moment had to come and worked hard to fit it in somewhere.The real stand out of this group is Melissa McCarthy (TV's ""Mike and Molly"") who plays Megan, Dougie's sister and a de-facto bridesmaid. She is a stocky, manly woman who likes to deal with things matter-of-factly, providing a firm handshake, her wrist covered by a carpal tunnel bandage, and a straight word. At the engagement party, she wears slacks, a button down shirt and a little Kangol hat, covering most of her hair. It's almost a clich&eacute;, but because she is the least acceptably ""desirable"", she is naturally the most sexually advanced of the group, the most outgoing, the most willing to try anything. She also consistently reveals new things about her character. Because she and Annie are the most different, Annie has the most trouble accepting her new friend. But she proves to be the most interesting of the bridesmaids.The other bridesmaids, played by Ellie Kemper (TV's ""The Office"") and Wendi McLendon-Covey are the most forgettable. In fact, they seem to disappear completely for the last half of the film.Annie's entire life is a mess, but the mess of her romantic perils takes center stage. She is in a relationship with a richer, better-looking man (Hamm) and their encounters are funny because they are so painful for Annie and we want to yell at her ""Are you crazy?"" Yet, she keeps coming back. After an evening of sex, which he seems to enjoy much more than she does, Annie leaves and tries to return to her car. But he hasn't opened his gate. Rather than face the indignation of returning to him, waking him up, and asking him, she tries to climb over. Just as she is about to slide over the top, the maid arrives and opens it with her clicker, Annie riding the gate like a mechanical bull.Later, she meets Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd, ""Pirate Radio"", ""Gulliver's Travels (2009))"", a Minneapolis State Trooper, who pulls her over. They run into each other again, start talking and eventually go on a date. He really is quite charming, and exactly the type of guy Annie should be with. But all of the distractions in Annie's life cause her to flip out when he makes a sweet gesture and she shuts him out. Later, she needs his help and has to go to great lengths to get his existence.""Bridesmaids"" is better written than most ""SNL"" comedies, most of which seem like a series of extended skits. But it does occasionally feel episodic: Engagement party, Bridesmaids have lunch, Try on gowns, Trip to Vegas, Bridal shower, Wedding. Each of these is funny to varying degrees. But when each of these set-ups ends, there are the 'in-between' scenes, the moments meant to move the narrative along and connect the dots. While well written, they are less funny and slow the entire film down. The best of these are the moments between Annie and her two lovers, because we all know people who are in the same situation and Annie seems to make the same choices they do, both good and bad. With Hamm's character, they are funnier, but with O'Dowd's character they are sweeter, more romantic and even a little charming.Three scenes really stand out for their comedic value. The engagement party which ends with the never-ending dueling toasts has another funny joke running throughout. Even during the toasts, when the scene seems to be going on forever and ever and ever, we start laughing for that very reason. Neither woman is willing to give up because to do so would give the other woman the upper hand.Later, Annie gets the bridal party to go to lunch at a Brazilian chiaroscuro. Despite the dubious appearance, they decide to go ahead at Lillian's urging. Everyone digs into the plethora of meats wholeheartedly. These moments pay off later when they try on gowns at a super-chic, expensive boutique.The bridesmaids decide they want to party in Vegas, despite Annie suggesting a more modest, local idea. Annie buys a coach ticket; everyone else splurges on First Class. As soon as Annie sits down, she starts to freak out because she is afraid of planes. Annie runs up to First Class to talk to Lillian. Helen quickly gives Annie some pills to calm her down. Everything escalates from there.The trip to Vegas is particularly good, well-written, funny and memorable. But it takes place about half way through the film. When it is over, the rest of the film is noticeably less funny and seems a bit long. It is still a good film, fun to watch, but it almost seems like a different film.""Bridesmaids"" is very good, if uneven. You should definitely check it out. I get the feeling this is the first of many memorable examples of Kristen Wiig's comedy we will get to see on the big screen.",4,"Something Funny, Something Borrowed, Something Blue, Something

During all this, Annie's romantic life is complicated by a waning entanglement with a man whose interest in her is mainly physical and a relationship with kind and respectful police officer whom she met thanks to a long-broken taillight.The story isn't all that interesting and the fact that only the audience sees things from Annie's point if view is near infuriating, in my opinion.

Her life is falling apart like her old car. But her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph), who is going to marry, asks Annie to be her bride of honor. Annie is happy to accept, but soon realizes that organizing a wedding requires great patience especially when you have to compete with rich and domineering Helen (Rose Byrne).Whether or not you like ""Bridesmaids,"" one of the biggest hits of 2011, depends on what you expect from the film, which is produced by Judd Apatow. ""Bridesmaids"" is a ""laugh-out-loud"" comedy, not a romantic comedy. The film's story is more about the rivalry and friendship between women, which is told with several gross-out jokes involving sex, food poisoning and drinking.In comedy there is a thin line between ""laughing with"" and ""laughing at."" While wavering between the two territories, ""Bridesmaids"" often leans toward the latter with episodes (the bathroom scene) that will make you laugh at the expense of the characters' dignities. While some audiences will find it hilarious, others will think it is embarrassing. OK, ""The Help"" also has a pie-eating episode, but it is not that crude.""Bridesmaids"" is a string of sketches cobbled together.

1387090,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00466HN7M,Turfseer,"[2, 6]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0Many people compared 'Bridesmaids' to 'The Hangover' but in terms of the comic tone of its characters, I found it much more similar to a recent indie film, 'Cyrus'. Both films attempt to get laughs by introducing a series of passive-aggressive types. The passive-aggressive credentials of the film's protagonist, Annie Walker, is established very early on when she sleeps with a boyfriend who also is afflicted with a passive-aggressive personality. When the boyfriend aggressively declares he has a rule about not sleeping over, instead of acting angrily, Annie lamely declares, ""you're funny in the morning.""The interesting thing about the passive-aggressive type is that the passivity masks a deeply repressed reservoir of anger. When the anger finally rises to the surface, it often comes out as a challenge, marked by a hurried retreat. We see this when Annie and her best friend Lillian (the bride to be) attempt to take an exercise class in the park without paying. When they're found out by the instructor, they run off with the excuse that they can no longer afford the high price of admission (despite actually costing $12).Annie's lack of self-esteem is on display when she turns off her customers by telling them that you can't trust anybody, while working as a salesperson at the jewelry store. As is often the case with a lot of the characters here, there's a thin line between the unsavoriness of their blatant aggression and viewing that aggression as humorous.Often the language of the passive-aggressive character is cloaked in overly diplomatic terms; the underlying sub-text of course, is an insult. For example, when Annie's mother (played by Jill Clayburgh in her last film role) tries to put a positive spin on Annie's negative life situation, she relates a story of a floundering gay prostitute she met at an AA meeting, concluding that ""hitting bottom is a good thing.""Screenwriters Wiig and co-writer Annie Mumulo try to mine as many laughs as possible from Lillian's assorted bridesmaids with mixed results. Lillian's cousin Rita can't stand her ""disgusting"" three teenagers and the joke about semen being all over the house is too crude to be funny. Becca, Lillian's friend from work and Megan, the groom's sister, ineptly conclude that Annie isn't single when they spot her next to two successive creepy guys who they should have known she would have no interest in. Little is done with newly married Becca character throughout the film but Megan (Melissa McCarthy from the 'Mike & Molly' TV series) proves to be one of the more amusing aggressive characters in the passive-aggressive pantheon. Megan not only can bond with a dolphin while on vacation but isn't afraid to make her sexual wants known (in spying one particular tall guy at the wedding, she proclaims, ""I'm going to climb that like a tree"").It's Helen, the snippy Trophy wife of the groom's boss, who turns out to be Bridesmaid's central antagonist. Again, the dialectic between her passive and aggressive side is evident when we first meet her. Helen aggressively attempts to steal Annie's thunder as they lock horns with their back and forth toasts to Lillian at the engagement party (the joke becomes tiresome as it goes on for much too long). There's more silly shenanigans during the tennis game, when we view Helen and Annie blasting one another with tennis balls in slow motion. Only Helen's completely lame, passive remark to the stepson's expletive (""put a quarter in the smear jar"") hits the mark!Annie begins to lose Lillian's affections when she brings the bridesmaids to the Brazilian restaurant and most of them end up with food poisoning later on at the fitting room. It's a scene that doesn't work at all as it's too divorced from any kind of recognizable reality (both Megan and Lillian end up defecating in inappropriate places including a sink and outside in the middle of the street). Annie's meltdown on the plane to Vegas proves to be only slightly more amusing. Most of it relies on Annie's face-off with the flight attendant while she's intoxicated. The bit with Annie in sunglasses pretending to be a first-class passenger is something a real drunk would do--but when Annie exclaims that there's a 'colonial woman' churning butter out on the wing--that is truly a line of inspired lunacy! Meanwhile we do take some pleasure in Megan's vindication over her insistence that the man sitting next to her on the plane indeed turns out to be an air marshal.There's one more truly amusing moment before 'Bridesmaids' devolves into sentimental romantic comedy--that's Annie's confrontation with the young woman back at the jewelry store, resulting in her being fired (in substance: Young lady: Did you take your Xanax? Annie: You have four boyfriends--have fun having a baby at your prom).Once Annie has her final meltdown at Lillian's shower, Lillian expresses her true feelings toward Annie (how she's truly screwed up the pre-wedding preparations). Events are now set in motion where whatever comedy remains in this very spotty laugh-fest, is lost. Megan drops her animosity toward Annie and conscripts her to help find Lillian who's gotten cold feet about going through with the wedding. I haven't mentioned Officer Rhodes as he's the least interesting character in the film. After Rhodes reluctantly agrees to help locate Lillian (he traces through her cell phone messages), it's only inevitable that he and Annie will end up together after Annie's initial sabotage of their relationship.'Bridesmaids' probably has gotten more accolades than it deserves as it's one of the few films today that features an ensemble of women in comic roles. Unfortunately those roles are formulaic, as the passive-aggressive types proffered up here, could probably fit into any situation featuring contemporary mores. Occasionally there's a clever line or two but the humor quickly devolves into silly slapstick or outright crudity. Perhaps with some tighter editing, 'Bridesmaids' might have proved more palatable in the end.",1,Passive-aggressive character types inhabit inconsistently funny and often crude comic

And then you get to witness every event prior to the wedding get completely messed up in some way, from the engagement party, to the bridal shower, to the bachelorette party. And probably one of the funniest scenes- the girls go pick out their dresses.... Really, it's best to just watch it instead of having people talk to much about it.

1387095,A2BDQQ39DJ826Y,B00466HN7M,viewer,"[3, 12]","When I am in the mood for a fun, screwball comedy, it is nice to find a film by Saturday Night Live cast members.  Over the years, I have missed a lot of these movies (all of Belushi, Adam Sandler, and Rob Schneider, much of Will Ferrell and Mike Myers and (fortunately) Bill Murray; plus Baby Mama, MacGruber, and others).  And there have been some big disappointments (like Master of Disguise, Stuart Saves His Family).  But I still look forward to the ones I am able to get to the theater to see.  The latest was Bridesmaids, which generally received good reviews but which left me with mixed feelings.  The plot is well summarized by other reviews, so I will not repeat it.There were some funny scenes.  Stand-outs include the bridesmaids trying on fancy gowns while being stricken with food poisoning from a diner Wiig took them to; Wiig acting crazy on a plane, or to vent her frustrations at the over-the-top bridal shower, or to get a patrolman's attention.  Although crude at times, the movie mainly came across as cute, sweet, and genuine.  Overall, the acting was good.  Wiig's down-to-earth, slightly cranky policeman boyfriend stole the show.  The characters were quirky but had real humanity.  Only the narcissistic pig who Wiig spent the night with at the start of the movie was a total loser, and he got some well-deserved comeuppance (but not enough, due to a too low-key Wiig).  The movie avoided mean-spirited or over-the-top caricaturing.  Even Wiig's nemesis, her childhood friend Maya Rudolph's glitzy, seemingly perfect new friend, ended up being portrayed sympathetically as a decent person.  The characters' actions, even when exaggerated for laughs, mostly seemed to flow naturally from who they were presented to be.  The movie suggested the larger themes that life is what you make of it and that tomorrow is another day.But the movie fell short.  Qualities that made it endearing also held back and sapped its energy.  The movie was too slight and understated, and its storytelling too choppy, slow, and uncertain (as, to some extent, was Wiig's acting; Rudolph was reduced to a totally straight role, with none of her normal spark).  The film's scattered attempts to be serious and to send a message (including simply coasting on some easy-listening song lyrics toward the end) felt vague, superficial, and false.For example, at a low point for Wiig, when she is hiding out at her mother's home depressed, a loud, crass bridesmaid who is Rudolph's groom's sister and appears to have no prior relationship and to have spent almost no time with Wiig, suddenly shows up and starts wrestling with her on the couch (to get her to show some spunk, we are told).  But this key scene (which also includes the sister trashing the groom to Wiig for no reason and with no explanation) comes out of nowhere.  There is no preparation for it in the character of this other bridesmaid or any familiarity or rapport between the two women.  It is uncomfortable, drawn-out, and phony.  Wiig, again acting far too subdued (as she does too often in the film), does not even seem to get it, or to take it anywhere.  To chalk this up to Wiig's character's self esteem problems does not make it interesting or effective.  Another example, also a key scene, is when the new friend's plans for a flamboyant, extravagant wedding finally become too much for Rudolph, who goes AWOL, returns to her roots, reconciles with Wiig, and says the whole thing has gotten out of hand and out of sync, financially and otherwise, with her family and friends.  Yet, the movie bulled right ahead, as if the scene had never happened, to exactly the overblown wedding that Rudolph supposedly had come to realize was not true to who she is, just to squeeze laughs out of all of the excess and to close on a flashy note.Nor did it help the movie that some of the gags did not flow naturally from the characters and story, but were gratuitous, silly, or pat.  A small example was Wiig suddenly becoming childish after a serious scene with the policeman, giggling to him to run the siren, just to provide a light-hearted note to end on.  A much worse example was the ill-fitting, baseless, tasteless scene about a sandwich that was tacked on to the end credits when it should have been left on the cutting room floor or for a deleted scenes disk.These problems dragged down a movie that I wanted to like a lot more.",3,Likable but too thin and low-key to deliver bigger laughs or a serious point,1309996800,"07 7, 2011",2011,4398,"['When', 'am', 'mood', 'fun', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'nice', 'find', 'film', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'cast', 'members', 'years', 'have', 'missed', 'lot', 'movies', 'Belushi', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'much', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'fortunately', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Baby', 'Mama', 'MacGruber', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'disappointments', 'Master', 'Disguise', 'Stuart', 'Family', 'still', 'look', 'forward', 'ones', 'am', 'able', 'get', 'theater', 'see', 'latest', 'was', 'Bridesmaids', 'generally', 'received', 'good', 'reviews', 'left', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'plot', 'well', 'summarized', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'it.There', 'were', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Stand-outs', 'include', 'bridesmaids', 'trying', 'fancy', 'gowns', 'being', 'stricken', 'food', 'poisoning', 'diner', 'Wiig', 'took', 'Wiig', 'acting', 'crazy', 'plane', 'vent', 'frustrations', 'over-the-top', 'bridal', 'shower', 'get', 'patrolman', 'attention', 'crude', 'times', 'movie', 'mainly', 'came', 'cute', 'sweet', 'genuine', 'Overall', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'Wiig', 'down-to-earth', 'slightly', 'cranky', 'policeman', 'boyfriend', 'stole', 'show', 'characters', 'were', 'quirky', 'had', 'real', 'humanity', 'Only', 'narcissistic', 'pig', 'who', 'Wiig', 'spent', 'night', 'start', 'movie', 'was', 'total', 'loser', 'got', 'well-deserved', 'comeuppance', 'not', 'enough', 'due', 'too', 'low-key', 'Wiig', 'movie', 'avoided', 'mean-spirited', 'over-the-top', 'caricaturing', 'Even', 'Wiig', 'nemesis', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'glitzy', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'new', 'friend', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'portrayed', 'sympathetically', 'decent', 'person', 'characters', 'actions', 'even', 'when', 'exaggerated', 'laughs', 'mostly', 'seemed', 'flow', 'naturally', 'who', 'were', 'presented', 'be', 'movie', 'suggested', 'larger', 'themes', 'life', 'what', 'make', 'tomorrow', 'day.But', 'movie', 'fell', 'short', 'Qualities', 'made', 'endearing', 'also', 'held', 'back', 'sapped', 'energy', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'slight', 'understated', 'storytelling', 'too', 'choppy', 'slow', 'uncertain', 'extent', 'was', 'Wiig', 'acting', 'Rudolph', 'was', 'reduced', 'totally', 'straight', 'role', 'none', 'normal', 'spark', 'film', 'scattered', 'attempts', 'be', 'serious', 'send', 'message', 'including', 'simply', 'coasting', 'easy-listening', 'song', 'lyrics', 'end', 'felt', 'vague', 'superficial', 'false.For', 'example', 'low', 'point', 'Wiig', 'when', 'hiding', 'out', 'mother', 'home', 'depressed', 'loud', 'crass', 'bridesmaid', 'who', 'Rudolph', 'groom', 'sister', 'have', 'prior', 'relationship', 'have', 'spent', 'almost', 'time', 'Wiig', 'suddenly', 'up', 'wrestling', 'couch', 'get', 'show', 'spunk', 'are', 'told', 'key', 'scene', 'also', 'sister', 'trashing', 'groom', 'Wiig', 'reason', 'explanation', 'nowhere', 'preparation', 'character', 'other', 'bridesmaid', 'familiarity', 'rapport', 'two', 'women', 'uncomfortable', 'drawn-out', 'phony', 'Wiig', 'again', 'acting', 'far', 'too', 'subdued', 'too', 'often', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'seem', 'get', 'take', 'anywhere', 'chalk', 'up', 'Wiig', 'character', 'self', 'esteem', 'problems', 'not', 'make', 'interesting', 'effective', 'example', 'also', 'key', 'scene', 'when', 'new', 'friend', 'plans', 'flamboyant', 'extravagant', 'wedding', 'finally', 'become', 'too', 'much', 'Rudolph', 'who', 'AWOL', 'roots', 'reconciles', 'Wiig', 'whole', 'thing', 'gotten', 'hand', 'sync', 'financially', 'otherwise', 'family', 'friends', 'movie', 'bulled', 'right', 'ahead', 'scene', 'had', 'never', 'happened', 'exactly', 'overblown', 'wedding', 'Rudolph', 'supposedly', 'had', 'come', 'realize', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'who', 'just', 'squeeze', 'excess', 'close', 'flashy', 'note.Nor', 'did', 'help', 'movie', 'gags', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'naturally', 'characters', 'story', 'were', 'gratuitous', 'silly', 'pat', 'small', 'example', 'was', 'Wiig', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'childish', 'serious', 'scene', 'policeman', 'giggling', 'run', 'siren', 'just', 'provide', 'light-hearted', 'note', 'end', 'much', 'worse', 'example', 'was', 'ill-fitting', 'baseless', 'tasteless', 'scene', 'sandwich', 'was', 'tacked', 'end', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'disk.These', 'problems', 'dragged', 'down', 'movie', 'wanted', 'like', 'lot', 'more']",N/A

I know that because I have been around women. Many people liked this film, and even demanded a sequel! So I had to see what the hype was.Sadly, I was more than disappointed. The story is that Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is chosen to be Lillian Donovan's (Maya Rudolph) maid of honor. Unfortunately Annie manages to ruin every event of her engagement party, on both the plane ride, the bus ride, and the restaurant. Annie hopes for love with Ted, but begins flirting with a police officer, Nathan Rhodes. Annie goes through a tantrum after Helen gives Lillian a trip to paris. Lillian and Annie are then no longer friends. Megan, who is basically a wannabe lesbian character, gives Annie a pep talk. This the most absurd story ever written! No one, I repeat,  NO ONE ACTS LIKE THIS! I have spoke with many women and they have never had any type of experience. It is completely over exaggerated and unrealistic.The amount of profanity in this film is beyond unnecessary. They drop the ""F"" bomb in almost every line.

1387115,A18RJ91B28WFJ2,B00466HN7M,zebrastripes,"[0, 1]","I purchased Bridesmaids (Blu-ray) after hearing the movie's positive response and 2 Oscar Nominations. The premise and movie title sound silly but the film really is well crafted and at times extremely funny. As someone who hates cheap chick flicks, such as 27 Dresses and He's Just Not That Into You, this was a nice little treat. But as a warning, it does fall under some stereotypical chick flick factors. I would really only recommend this movie and review to women or men who have any somewhat enjoyment in romance and chick flick type movies. Because if you do not - this movie is not for you!Bridesmaids is about Annie Walker and Lillian Donovan. They are absolutely best friends and when Lillian gets married, Annie is obviously going to be maid of honor. But here is some background on Annie. Her life pretty much blows chunks. She has a self absorbed boyfriend that uses her for sex, her apartment sibling roommates are obnoxious, and her baking career was an absolute failure. Now back to the story. Annie eventually meets the other bridesmaids who will be in the wedding! This consists of cousin Rita, friend Becca, sister-in-law Megan (nominated for an academy award for best actress), and Helen. Wondering why I did not describe Helen? Well she is one of those girls we all hate to be jealous of. She is Lillian's soon to be husband's boss's wife. She is beautiful, knows how to take charge, and most importantly... comes off as she is trying to steal Annie away from Lillian. Throughout the movie the girls make wedding plans and disasters and drama unfolds! Will Annie, Helen, and Lillian be able to solve their jealous girl problems? Will Annie ever restore her career and find the man of her dreams? It is all pretty obvious but unlike most chick flicks, it is actually funny and entertaining to see it all play out. They go through ridiculous events of finding the perfect wedding dress with stomach illness, the over the top glamourous bridal shower which included getting your own puppy as a party favor, and the sort of bachelorette party. The audience will be gasping at the crazy things these grown women will do!The most enjoyable character in this movie was Megan played by Melissa McCarthy. She is absolutely hilarious in everything she says and does. Not to mention, she gives a surprisingly heartfelt pep talk to Annie late in the movie! I feel that all of the other bridesmaids were enjoyable but overshadowed by Megan's brilliance. We need more strong and unconventionally beautiful actresses like her in the world we live in. On a strange note, there are a lot of over the top scenes from Annie. While they were funny, a part of me wanted to cringe seeing her throw a tantrum like a young child. While she found her footing by the end of the movie and turned out to be a successful women, the way she cried and put an unbelievable amount of selfish stress on her friend during her wedding planing was unfair and immature. What is good, is that the movie does correct this and teach a lesson in the end.On some other somewhat downsides, I felt like this movie did not know if it wanted to be a raunchy comedy or a girly film for mothers and daughters. Many elements such as the romance and concept of weddings and girl power definitely makes this movie at least half chick flick. But it is so very raunchy. The girls vomit, the girls are absolutely vulgar, and honestly the sex scenes were a little ridiculous and I would have appreciated them to be a little more tasteful. Nonetheless, it was still all entertaining and interesting combination of genres.In conclusion, I really enjoyed watching this movie with my family. It would make a good movie to pull out on a girls night as long as the audience is 15 years old and up. While the language and jokes probably would be find, I really have a hard time imagining a parent wanting young girls to see the sex scenes in this. My younger sister, 13 years old, did watch it but I wish I could have known ahead of time to fast forward. In a way, this film promotes successful women but in other ways makes them seem selfish and foolish.
