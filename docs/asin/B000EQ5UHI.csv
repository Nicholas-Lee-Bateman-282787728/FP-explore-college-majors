The movie starts at the end of the traditional Little Red Riding Hood, with the police showing up to try and question each one as to what happened. Each one has their own version as to what happened. From Little Red Riding Hood's point of view it looked like the Wolf was trying to kill her. Then you get to the Wolf's story next, he's an reporter investigating the Goody Bandit and thinks Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are the bandits. All of his weird and scary behavior is explained easily, his tail gets caught in the camera causing him to scream in pain, Red doesn't see this only that he lets out a scary roar. The ax man is actually an actor who got a call back, and Granny is into extreme sports. Its a funny movie full of funny moments as each one tells their tales of their journey to Granny's house. The Wolf question other bake shops, and visits his snitch a sheep, a mafia sheep, and while wearing disguises. He has a coffee-addicted squirrel friend, Wolf has tons of funny one-liners and full of sarcasm. Red runs into a goat cursed by witch he can only sing everything he says, except at one point he doesn't and Red points it out to him. The goat also has horns for everything including campfire set, laundry, and with hair.  Granny turns out to be completely badass and very into extreme sports.

It used to be, long ago, that cartoons were either Disney fluff with barely any plot, or, consisted of a series of slapsticks pratfalls, also with barely any plot. Hoodwinked takes a good story, the Little Red Riding Hood story and tells it from the different views of the wolf, the axman, Red, and Granny, each with a secret. The cartoon has its facial distortions and occasional slapstick to appeal to the kids, but there are also a lot of humor directed towards adults (e.g., the wolf complains about being automatically blamed, ""Talk about profiling""). It has some nice songs, great voices and a twist in the story.",5,Rashomon meets the Grimm Brothers,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,756,"['film', 'flew', 'radar', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Nevertheless', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'box', 'office', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'sequel', 'used', 'be', 'long', 'ago', 'cartoons', 'were', 'either', 'Disney', 'fluff', 'barely', 'plot', 'consisted', 'series', 'slapsticks', 'pratfalls', 'also', 'barely', 'plot', 'Hoodwinked', 'good', 'story', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'story', 'tells', 'different', 'views', 'wolf', 'axman', 'Red', 'Granny', 'secret', 'cartoon', 'facial', 'distortions', 'occasional', 'slapstick', 'appeal', 'kids', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'humor', 'directed', 'towards', 'adults', 'e.g.', 'wolf', 'being', 'automatically', 'blamed', 'Talk', 'profiling', 'nice', 'songs', 'great', 'voices', 'twist', 'story']",N/A

976866,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000EQ5UHI,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","We all know the story of Little Red Riding Hood, right? But with director Cory Edwards at the helm of this fairy tale, things get changed ...just a wee bit.Little Red (voiced by Anne Hathaway, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) wants out of the forest. She's not happy living in such a constrained society. She dreams of flying over the mountains and seeing what lay beyond. But bad things are afoot in the forest. Food establishments are closing due to a rash of recipe thefts. Little Red has to protect her and Granny's recipe book before it disappears as well. But who's behind these thefts? And for what reason? When Little Red arrives at Granny's house, the typical meeting with The Wolf occurs ...sort of. Granny (voiced by Glen Close, FATAL ATTRACTION) is tied up in the closet (or is she?) The Wolf asks Little Red lots of probing questions about her basket. And as Little Red discovers that The Wolf is not Granny, The Woodsman comes bashing through a window wielding his axe and acting murderous. But is he?The police are called in to investigate this ""domestic disturbance"" and as Detective Nicky Flippers (voiced by David Ogden Stiers, M*A*S*H) soon discovers, many more strange things are happening than meets the eye. Granny has a triple-G tattoo on her neck and loves extreme sports (paying homage to xXx with Vin Diesel). The Wolf (voiced by Patrick Warburton, SKY HIGH) is actually a reporter researching the recent recipe thefts and feels that Granny and Little Red are at the center of it. The Woodsman (voiced by James Belushi, K-9) is just a Schnitzel-On-A-Stick salesman turned actor trying to find his inner Woodsman. And Little Red is simply a delivery girl who's disenchanted with the world around her.Borrowing from just about every action film out there, HOODWINKED really works. Everything from THE MATRIX to CITY SLICKERS is referenced ...and it's done very well. The animation seems nearly old-fashioned and out-of-date, which actually adds a quaint quality to the film; it's not trying too hard to be something it isn't. It isn't FINDING NEMO or SHREK. It couldn't be with a budget only a fraction of what those two animation goliaths cost. This is an independent film (gotta love `em!), so money is stretched thin. Which leads me to my next point ...When the film was put out at theaters (in limited release), it didn't have the marketing budget that Pixar and Disney had for theirs. Professional reviews were cool (to say the least), which leads me to wonder if this movie had been put out by Disney or Pixar what the reviews might have been like. With action figures at Toys-R-Us, computer games, posters, and God only knows what else, the financial ability of the production company might have weighed heavy on the minds of reviewers and how children (and adults) viewed it. Trust me, this IS an issue. Independent films struggle under the shadow of these huge film companies.And here's the thing: this movie is GOOD. It's not perfect by any means, but it's fun, light, engaging, voiced well, animated fine, and uproariously entertaining. I especially enjoyed Twitchy the speed-talking squirrel whose brush with caffeine addiction makes for some of the funnier moments. I also liked Japeth the singing Goat, who takes a ride with Little Red through a mine that looks suspiciously like the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad attraction at Disneyland. A little needling at the Disney corporation maybe? Loved it!And who is the recipe thief, you may be asking. Well that's something you'll HAVE to find out for yourself ...and it's worth it.",4,An Independent Animation That Deserves Some Attention,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,3553,"['know', 'story', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'right', 'director', 'Cory', 'Edwards', 'helm', 'fairy', 'tale', 'things', 'get', 'changed', 'just', 'wee', 'bit.Little', 'Red', 'voiced', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'forest', 'not', 'happy', 'living', 'such', 'constrained', 'society', 'flying', 'mountains', 'seeing', 'what', 'lay', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'afoot', 'forest', 'Food', 'establishments', 'are', 'closing', 'due', 'rash', 'recipe', 'thefts', 'Little', 'Red', 'protect', 'Granny', 'recipe', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'thefts', 'what', 'reason', 'When', 'Little', 'Red', 'Granny', 'house', 'typical', 'meeting', 'Wolf', 'occurs', 'sort', 'Granny', 'voiced', 'Glen', 'Close', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'tied', 'up', 'closet', 'Wolf', 'Little', 'Red', 'lots', 'probing', 'questions', 'basket', 'Little', 'Red', 'Wolf', 'not', 'Granny', 'Woodsman', 'bashing', 'window', 'wielding', 'axe', 'acting', 'murderous', 'police', 'are', 'called', 'investigate', 'domestic', 'disturbance', 'Detective', 'Nicky', 'Flippers', 'voiced', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'M*A*S*H', 'soon', 'discovers', 'many', 'more', 'strange', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'eye', 'Granny', 'triple-G', 'tattoo', 'neck', 'extreme', 'sports', 'paying', 'homage', 'xXx', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Wolf', 'voiced', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'SKY', 'HIGH', 'actually', 'reporter', 'researching', 'recent', 'recipe', 'thefts', 'feels', 'Granny', 'Little', 'Red', 'are', 'center', 'Woodsman', 'voiced', 'James', 'Belushi', 'K-9', 'just', 'Schnitzel-On-A-Stick', 'salesman', 'turned', 'actor', 'trying', 'find', 'inner', 'Woodsman', 'Little', 'Red', 'simply', 'delivery', 'girl', 'who', 'disenchanted', 'world', 'her.Borrowing', 'just', 'action', 'film', 'there', 'HOODWINKED', 'really', 'Everything', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'CITY', 'SLICKERS', 'referenced', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'animation', 'nearly', 'old-fashioned', 'out-of-date', 'actually', 'quaint', 'quality', 'film', 'not', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'something', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'FINDING', 'NEMO', 'SHREK', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'budget', 'only', 'fraction', 'what', 'two', 'animation', 'goliaths', 'cost', 'independent', 'film', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'em', 'money', 'stretched', 'thin', 'Which', 'next', 'point', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'theaters', 'limited', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'marketing', 'budget', 'Pixar', 'Disney', 'had', 'theirs', 'Professional', 'reviews', 'were', 'cool', 'say', 'least', 'wonder', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'out', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'what', 'reviews', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'action', 'figures', 'Toys-R-Us', 'computer', 'games', 'posters', 'God', 'only', 'what', 'else', 'financial', 'ability', 'production', 'company', 'might', 'have', 'weighed', 'heavy', 'minds', 'reviewers', 'how', 'children', 'adults', 'viewed', 'Trust', 'issue', 'Independent', 'films', 'struggle', 'shadow', 'huge', 'film', 'companies.And', 'here', 'thing', 'movie', 'GOOD', 'not', 'perfect', 'means', 'fun', 'light', 'engaging', 'voiced', 'well', 'animated', 'fine', 'uproariously', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Twitchy', 'speed-talking', 'squirrel', 'brush', 'caffeine', 'addiction', 'funnier', 'moments', 'also', 'liked', 'Japeth', 'singing', 'Goat', 'who', 'ride', 'Little', 'Red', 'mine', 'suspiciously', 'Big', 'Thunder', 'Mountain', 'Railroad', 'attraction', 'Disneyland', 'little', 'needling', 'Disney', 'corporation', 'maybe', 'Loved', 'who', 'recipe', 'thief', 'may', 'be', 'asking', 'Well', 'something', ""'ll"", 'HAVE', 'find', 'out']",N/A

The focus of the story is a mystery, narrated in the Dragnet style. That was enough to keep me amused while my nine year old granddaughter laughed at the sillier aspects of the movie.I also found the story to be cleverly intricate, which also kept my attention. Many isolated events which don't seem to make sense as you witness them singly are wrapped up when the ending explained what was really happening.The voice talent includes a surprisingly rich cast, with stars like Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, James Belushi, Patrick Warburton, Anthony Anderson, David Ogden Stiers, and Andy Dick. The performances are convincing and amusing. Animation is in a cartoon style, with vibrant but flat-textured colors. Still, I thought it had an attractive look.As a disclaimer I'll have to say that my son and daughter-in-law, who have to watch (or at least listen) to the film often ... since my granddaughter likes it a lot ... rather than the one time I viewed it, seem to find it a bit annoying at times, especially around the yodeling parts, I think. LOL However, I was not annoyed by any of it, which is a real plus for programming aimed at kids these days.

""Hoodwinked"" is a movie about Little Red Riding Hood bringing treats to her grandmother, which of course there is a wolf in her place.  From that point the story becomes a crime scene and more characters are introduced.  Someone is stealing recipes and each character tells their version of the story.  My favorite part is the Woodsman and his Schnitzel singing skit - think Schnitzel truck instead of ice cream truck!  The DVD doesn't have any inappropriate scenes that I remember, but it may be a little hard to understand for young kids.  My boys thought the music was funny and loved all the funny characters, mainly the different animals!  It is a movie I could watch more than once because there is a lot going on in the scenes and I love the music!  It really is a cute movie!

The movie opens with Red (as in Little Riding Hood) making the fabled entrance into Grandma's house, encountering the wolf, with bound-and-gagged grandma and the ax-wielding woodsman arriving on the scene--then the cops show up.  Amphibian investigator Nicky Flippers takes over the case, interviewing all the key players one by one and having them each give, Rashomon-like, their version of the story.  The pleasure, as these tales unfold, is in seeing how elements of one character's explanation fits into or explains or even causes things seen in another character's version.  This plus the by now expected Shrek-style postmodern/referential humor makes the movie a fun one for adults, but I imagine older kids would enjoy the story too, seeing how it all fits together in the end, and fits into a larger plot involving an evil mastermind out to steal all the goodie recipes in the forest.The only rather limp subplot for me was Red's desire to see more of the world and not be protected from risk by her doting grandmother (who has secrets of her own).  That, and the songs, I could have done without.  The rest was sheer pleasure, and frequently laugh-out-loud fun.

What's great about this movie is that, although I guessed the bad guy about half way through it still keeped me guessing how things were to tie into one another.  It starts off a little slow, not so funny but then up comes the cute little bunny rabbit (Andy Dick) and it starts to quickly climb uphill...add in a singing goat with detatchable horns and a hyper active squirrel and you have some really funny scenes.  So heres the deal, a domestic disterbance call is made and we find Granny tied up, the Wolf wearing a granny mask and apron and a woodsman screaming with an ax...and theres Red just, ummm, standing there.  The police cheif and detective sit each one down and get there side of the story.  You see, this incident they believe ties in with the Goodie Bandit, someone whos been stealing the recipes of the neighborhood and putting all the 'goodie' makers out of business.  You see Granny is a famous 'goodie' maker and Red is her delivery-girl.  As the stories unwind everything makes sense and they all connect in very clever and sometimes histerical ways.  This may not be as funny as 'Madagascar' or 'Ice Age' but it's as clever as 'Shrek' and that adds some major points making this a fun family film that everyone can enjoy.  Andy Dick is hilarious and makes this film as funny as it is.  Good choice of charactor selection, and excelent script so kudo's to the writting team here.

My wife and I kept exchanging glances at each other as if to say, ""What are we watching here?  This is garbage!""  But then a funny thing happened...it got really good.  So here is my advice to someone watching the movie.  Give it a chance and don't turn it off after ten minutes!Of course, the first ten minutes are necessary to the plot of the movie, but it seems very jumbled and is filled with so many fairy tale characters that you begin the movie very overwhelmed.  Plus, the animation is very medicore (let's face it, it's not PIXAR!), and it makes you wonder what could this movie possible offer.  But you begin to like the feel of the animation as it brings back memories of the animation of the original fairytales, with characters with large eyes and cutesy woodland creatures.The voicework in this movie, though, is outstanding with Anne Hathaway (Princess Diaries) as Red and Patrick Warburton (David Puddy from Seinfeld) as the Wolf, among others.  And besides the uneasy, unintentional laughter that takes place in the first ten minutes, the rest of the movie is filled with a lot of laughter and a good mystery (for kids).  I, however, guessed who was the bandit about 20 minutes into the movie, but I don't think a kid would be able to guess it.  And this movie is more for kids (whereas a lot of cartoons these days are both for kids AND adults, with a lot of adult humor), but adults should still enjoy many different facets of the movie.  Going back to the laughter, I was roaring with laughter during the scenes with Japeth the Goat, who was under a curse to always sing and was constantly using his horns to swing around things.  Other parts of the movie are very funny as well so be ready to laugh.All in all, I would say that this a four star movie, as I have said the first ten minutes are odd and it does not compare to movies such as FInding Nemo or Toy Story.

Hoodwinked, a retelling of the classic fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood told from each character's point of view seemed all but forgotten in a rash of other higher profile animation releases such as cars, over the hedge, chicken little and many other computer animated films that just didn't really hit the mark all that well. Hoodwinked is a visual treat for anyone familiar with Rankin Bass type animated characters and the writing is tour de force with hundreds of little in jokes for those in the audience older than Red Riding Hood's original age target. Make no mistake, This movie is literally like Shrek on steroids with so many layers jammed into its' hour and a half running time that the creators could literally have made 3 movies out of it. There is never any off putting potty humor or dumbed down innuendo jokes so frequently found in this type of movie, its all over the top clever and if you blink, you'll miss some important funny anecdote. This movie is literally a crowd pleaser of the best kind. Kids will love the fast pace, adults will love the portrayals, creativity and non stop nudge the ribs of the person sitting next to you ""in"" jokes. Just be prepared to laugh yourself silly.

976889,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B000EQ5UHI,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[2, 4]","With its clever script and a host of fairy tale characters gone haywire, ""Hoodwinked"" explores, via police interrogation, the untold story of Red Riding Hood and her grandmother.  The film opens at the end of the known fairy tale when Red notices the big eyes, ears, and teeth of Granny, and discovers that it's really the Wolf.  An axe-wielding woodman breaks into the house, and rescues both Red and the tied-up Granny.  But is that the whole story?  As the viewer quickly learns, the answer is ""No.""Fairy tale land has been plagued by a recipe thief, who has put all the sweets bakers of the fairy tale world out of business - except for Granny.  Does Red or Granny have anything to do with this?  Why is the Big Bad Wolf dressed in Granny's clothes?  And could the Woodsman really be capable of rescuing Red?  Who is the hyper-active, speed talking squirrel, and why does the bunny keep cropping up in everyone's story?  What secrets do Red and her Granny hide?While individual parts of this movie are funny, it doesn't stick together well as a whole.  The computer animation is clunky, and the story itself, once the premise is revealed, is not particularly compelling.  Still, it has its moments:  a goat who ""talks"" in song, the taped voice of the squirrel re-played at a much slower speed, the crazed but sweet incompetence of the Woodsman, and the explanation of Red's vision of her grandmother.  Some of the twists are laugh out-loud funny, but most evoke merely a smile or two.This movie is good for a rental to enjoy with the kids, although they won't get most of the jokes.  Instead, they will probably enjoy the fast-paced, visually active parade of characters.

Parts reminded me of the old Bob Clampett/Tex Avery cartoons, others reminded me of the works of John Kricfalusi (Ren & Stimpy). Unlike the more ""accessible"" Pixar/Dreamworks efforts of recent years, ""Hoodwinked"" doesn't really try to push any particular message or theme, it just cranks the wackiness meter up to eleven, with crazy characters (including a beefy Ah-nuld soundalike, and an unforgettable singing mountain goat who you won't be able to get out of your head afterwards) and insane situations. It's told in a pseudo-Pulp Fiction/Rashomon ""answers first, questions later"" style which is quite interesting. You'll probably guess the identity of the villain long before the end, but that won't make it any less enjoyable. This film isn't really aimed at kids, more at ""kidults"", adults who have retained a childlike sense of fun and whimsy. Yes, the animation isn't as slick as what you'd normally see in a $100 million studio features, but world-class animation does not a good film make (""Shark Tale"", anyone?).

(No Spoilers Included)The open-ended one sentence summary: Goodie recipes have been disappearing from the forest lately, and now the police is investigating a domestic disturbance involving a wolf, a girl, a grandma, and an ax-wielding woodcutter, for possible connections. Hoo boy.Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Nothing that I specifically remember. A little mild violence maybe.Characters: 3 of 5 stars. While the animation was weak, you can't take it out on the characters. The casting was good, lots of big names in there, particually with Patrick Warburton as the Wolf. Twitchy the squirrel was probably the crowd favorite though, and had us kids in stitches. Japeth the Ram was popular too.Plot: 2 of 5 stars. Mostly just the same story told from different points of view, the classic whodunnit plot. They all kind of overlap, so it's difficult to follow at times, but the funny stuff seemed to be entertaining whoever didn't know what was going on. There was slapstick humor for the kids, and dialogue quips for the older crowd.Animation: 2 of 5 stars. The animation has not much going for it at all. I found some the character designs weak and distracting.Music: 2 of 5 stars. The original songs alternate from being funny to being really lame to being only semi-lame. Not much to like here, except maybe Japeth's song and Red is Blue.Impact: 3 of 5 stars. This movie tried to have some emotional impact, and it failed. That's probably because I didn't take the characters that seriously. I did find it to be really funny in parts, and I even laughed hysterically several times. There were some fun quotable lines and a satisfying ending, but it wasn't really my cup of tea... er coffee.

Made by a pair of brothers no one has even heard of, Tom and Cory Edwards, and distributed by the Weinstein brothers of Miramax fame, HOODWINKED provides a new and very twisted take on the Little Red Riding Hood fable. The plot as such involves someone stealing pastry recipes and plays out like RASHOMON, in that it ends up being told from various participants' perspectives. While the execution of the cartoon leaves something to be desired -- this is no SHREK or ICE AGE or MONSTERS INC. or even ROBOTS -- the story is absolutely hilarious and the characters (voiced by Andy Dick, Puddy, Glenn Close and Anne Hathaway) are wonderfully fleshed out. Some of the dialog is to die for, and plays equally well to adults and children. Just as importantly, HOODWINKED is a full-blown musical, and the music is as every bit as good as the dialog. The highlight is a number sung by a cursed billy goat (don't ask) as he explains his curse to Red and then takes her on the ride of her life. Many movies are referenced in HOODWINKED, including XXX, THE MATRIX and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, and there is a bizarre extreme sports sequence involving Red's surprisingly athletic grandmother.

976902,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000EQ5UHI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","The Goody Bandit has been out stealing recipes. Various goodies stores have had to shut down, having gone out of business. Little Red Riding Hood (voiced by Anne Hathaway) is the concerned goodies delivery girl who goes to deliver the book of recipes for safekeeping to her expert cookie-maker grandma, Granny Puckett (Glenn Close). En route, she is hassled by the Big Bad Wolf (Patrick Warburton), who later on masquerades as Red's grandma in her house. There follows a confrontation involving Red, the Wolf, Granny and a raging, axe-wielding woodsman (Jim Belushi), who had burst into the house moments before. Cut much later to a busy police-cordoned scene in front of Granny's house, where a domestic disturbance is being investigated. Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) is immediately suspicious of the Wolf, but Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers) conducts interviews of all parties involved. Each of the suspect then has his/her overlapping flashback version and it's soon pretty apparent that all is not as it seems. The Wolf is actually an investigative reporter looking into the Goody Bandit case. The woodsman is a schnitzel truck driver who dreams of being an actor. Granny is an extreme sports enthusiast. And just what does Boingo (Andy Dick), a cute bunny seemingly everywhere, have to do with it all? Well, it's a tricky case but if someone could break it, it's Nicky Flippers. Actually, it's pretty obvious who the culprit is but hey, the movie's still tons of fun.Hoodwinked is a pretty cool but bent animated film that modernizes and puts new twists and turns into the classic Little Red Riding Hood tale. It's as if E! True Hollywood Story had covered it. This movie channels Rashomon, Who Killed Roger Rabbit? and various police procedural movies, but with the pertinent roles being played by fairy tale characters. Nicky Flippers is obviously patterned after my favorite shamus Nick Charles: Flippers has on a William Powell-like mustache and his intro scene even has him walking in with a miniature terrier. Friends of mine have commented that the graphics are awkward and unpolished but I personally find it appealingly crude, lending a certain old school charm to the endeavor. The songs are also pretty nice, especially the Boingo song and the Schnitzel song.So, by all means, check this out and, along the way, keep an eye out for the singing goat.

976904,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B000EQ5UHI,Isaac,"[0, 3]","""Hoodwinked"" is an animated comedy with a good story, a colorful array of characters, and a silliness factor that occupies more of the material than it should; I have a feeling that a ""Shrek"" rival has yet to be made. What makes the film unique is that its a creative retelling of the Brothers Grimm tale ""Little Red Riding Hood"" from four different perspectives, in the classic ""Rashomon"" tradition. Apparently, the story is a lot more complicated than we could have imagined, with Red, Grandma, the Wolf, and the Woodsman intersecting with outside characters and having more off-the-wall motives than we thought.Instead of being the cute, innocent little girl from our childhood bedtime story, Red (Anne Hathaway) is a strong-willed, independent go-getter who makes deliveries for her Grandma (Glenn Close). The Wolf (Jeff Warburton) is not the bloodthirsty predator we always thought him out to be, but is instead a journalist out for a lead on the notorious Goody Bandit, a fiend who is stealing the treat recipes from every bakery in the forest (he is accompanied by a super-fast talking squirrel). The Woodsman (Jim Belushi) is, in fact, an actor hoping for a spot in a commercial, who manages to crash into Grandma's living room at a key moment, ax in hand. And Grandma has a secret or two of her own.We are introduced to a few other characters at the beginning of the film, before the key players step in to tell their versions of the story. Private Detective Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers) has been contacted to investigate the crime scene and to interrogate each of the four players, but he must also tame down the impatient Chief Grizzly (rap artist Xzibit) who is quick to pinpoint perps without evidence. Chief Grizzly's assistants are Officer Stork (Anthony Anderson) and the Three Little Pigs, who manage to fit the stereotypical image of police officers quite well with their pot bellies and gluttonous eating habits.That's all you'll get out of me, because explaining the details of the four perspectives will spoil everything, suffice it to say that each viewpoint lands the respective character in their Grimm tale position. Each character seems like the Goody Bandit. Maybe one is, or maybe not. But most of the film is each person recapping the day's events, with a climax involving the discovery of the Goody Bandit's identity and the race to stop his dasterdly plot to blow up the forest.The film would have been more fun, and better for that matter, had it not concerned itself with the Goody Bandit and stayed close knit with it's ""Rashomon"" style bulk. Here is a film with a great idea, and with brilliant takes on the original Red Riding Hood story, that is far too eager to jump to the pop-culture references and to ensue long-running gags. With each new joke, you become frustrated because you are already into film's mystery plot. This is a case in which the humor works as a distraction and not a natural output of the material.The key to making a successful animated film is to have actors whose voices give favor to their animated counterparts. This is something that ""Hoodwinked"" does right. Where 2003's ""Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas"" fell short was that you could picture the actors in the recording studio speaking their lines into a microphone. In ""Hoodwinked"" you can close your eyes and imagine the characters themselves, not the actors, taking part in the dialogue.An elegant fusion of hand drawings and CGI will captivate audience members, especially the little ones, who by now are more likely students of ""Shrek,"" ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Madagascar."" The animation itself is, however, not quite enough to overshadow the film's cock-eyed story, but it is a good companion to the characters. Even in the action scenes--a wild roller-coaster ride through a mine shaft, an avalanche-snowboarding sequence straight out of ""XXX,"" and a brawl aboard a ski chute--everything looks just as it would in real life, and the physics maintain their plausibilities with the characters onscreen. I am, however, questioning the PG rating, because nothing in the film compares to the loud action sequences in ""The Incredibles"" or the prologue family slaughter in ""Finding Nemo.""Maybe I'm complaining too much. The fact is that ""Hoodwinked"" is just as well-made as it has to be, but in an age where the ""Shrek"" films have taken society by storm, and ""The Incredibles"" have run rampant at the box office with a continuing series in talks, you'd better have a film that knows how to handle its material the right way. You can marvel at the film's humor and animation, but in the end the movie itself should have a little more reason for existing.Rated PG; 83 minutes; Directed by Corey Edwards and Tony Leech",3,Hoodwinked,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,4740,"['Hoodwinked', 'animated', 'comedy', 'good', 'story', 'colorful', 'array', 'characters', 'silliness', 'factor', 'more', 'material', 'should', 'have', 'feeling', 'Shrek', 'rival', 'yet', 'be', 'made', 'What', 'film', 'unique', 'creative', 'retelling', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'tale', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'four', 'different', 'perspectives', 'classic', 'Rashomon', 'tradition', 'Apparently', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'complicated', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'Red', 'Grandma', 'Wolf', 'Woodsman', 'intersecting', 'outside', 'characters', 'having', 'more', 'off-the-wall', 'motives', 'thought.Instead', 'being', 'cute', 'innocent', 'little', 'girl', 'childhood', 'bedtime', 'story', 'Red', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'strong-willed', 'independent', 'go-getter', 'who', 'deliveries', 'Grandma', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Wolf', 'Jeff', 'Warburton', 'not', 'bloodthirsty', 'predator', 'always', 'thought', 'out', 'be', 'instead', 'journalist', 'out', 'lead', 'notorious', 'Goody', 'Bandit', 'fiend', 'who', 'stealing', 'treat', 'recipes', 'bakery', 'forest', 'accompanied', 'super-fast', 'talking', 'squirrel', 'Woodsman', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'fact', 'actor', 'hoping', 'spot', 'commercial', 'who', 'crash', 'Grandma', 'living', 'room', 'key', 'moment', 'ax', 'hand', 'Grandma', 'secret', 'two', 'own.We', 'are', 'introduced', 'few', 'other', 'characters', 'beginning', 'film', 'key', 'players', 'step', 'tell', 'versions', 'story', 'Private', 'Detective', 'Nicky', 'Flippers', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'been', 'contacted', 'investigate', 'crime', 'scene', 'interrogate', 'four', 'players', 'must', 'also', 'tame', 'down', 'impatient', 'Chief', 'Grizzly', 'rap', 'artist', 'Xzibit', 'who', 'quick', 'pinpoint', 'perps', 'evidence', 'Chief', 'Grizzly', 'assistants', 'are', 'Officer', 'Stork', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'Three', 'Little', 'Pigs', 'who', 'manage', 'fit', 'stereotypical', 'image', 'police', 'officers', 'quite', 'well', 'pot', 'bellies', 'gluttonous', 'eating', 'habits.That', ""'ll"", 'get', 'explaining', 'details', 'four', 'perspectives', 'will', 'spoil', 'everything', 'suffice', 'say', 'viewpoint', 'respective', 'character', 'Grimm', 'tale', 'position', 'character', 'Goody', 'Bandit', 'Maybe', 'one', 'maybe', 'not', 'most', 'film', 'person', 'recapping', 'day', 'events', 'climax', 'involving', 'discovery', 'Goody', 'Bandit', 'identity', 'race', 'stop', 'dasterdly', 'plot', 'blow', 'up', 'forest.The', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'better', 'matter', 'had', 'not', 'concerned', 'Goody', 'Bandit', 'stayed', 'close', 'knit', 'Rashomon', 'style', 'bulk', 'Here', 'film', 'great', 'idea', 'brilliant', 'original', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'eager', 'jump', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'ensue', 'long-running', 'gags', 'new', 'joke', 'become', 'frustrated', 'are', 'already', 'film', 'mystery', 'plot', 'case', 'humor', 'distraction', 'not', 'natural', 'output', 'material.The', 'key', 'making', 'successful', 'animated', 'film', 'have', 'actors', 'voices', 'give', 'favor', 'animated', 'counterparts', 'something', 'Hoodwinked', 'right', 'Where', '2003', 'Sinbad', 'Legend', 'Seven', 'Seas', 'fell', 'short', 'was', 'could', 'picture', 'actors', 'recording', 'studio', 'speaking', 'lines', 'microphone', 'Hoodwinked', 'can', 'close', 'eyes', 'imagine', 'characters', 'not', 'actors', 'taking', 'part', 'dialogue.An', 'elegant', 'fusion', 'hand', 'drawings', 'CGI', 'will', 'captivate', 'audience', 'members', 'especially', 'little', 'ones', 'who', 'now', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'students', 'Shrek', 'Incredibles', 'Madagascar', 'animation', 'however', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'overshadow', 'film', 'cock-eyed', 'story', 'good', 'companion', 'characters', 'Even', 'action', 'scenes', 'wild', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'mine', 'shaft', 'avalanche-snowboarding', 'sequence', 'straight', 'XXX', 'brawl', 'ski', 'chute', 'everything', 'just', 'would', 'real', 'life', 'physics', 'maintain', 'plausibilities', 'characters', 'onscreen', 'am', 'however', 'questioning', 'PG', 'rating', 'nothing', 'film', 'loud', 'action', 'sequences', 'Incredibles', 'prologue', 'family', 'slaughter', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'too', 'much', 'fact', 'Hoodwinked', 'just', 'as', 'well-made', 'be', 'age', 'where', 'Shrek', 'films', 'have', 'taken', 'society', 'storm', 'Incredibles', 'have', 'run', 'rampant', 'box', 'office', 'continuing', 'series', 'talks', ""'d"", 'better', 'have', 'film', 'how', 'handle', 'material', 'right', 'way', 'can', 'marvel', 'film', 'humor', 'animation', 'end', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'reason', 'existing.Rated', 'PG', '83', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'Corey', 'Edwards', 'Tony', 'Leech']",N/A

If there's one thing that annoys me, it's judging a book by its cover, or, in the case of a CGI film, by the CGI budget. There's been a lot of badmouthing the animation on Hoodwinked, even by people who say that the story more than makes up for it. Well, it's true enough that the CGI is low-quality; but that does NOT translate to bad CGI, because high-quality graphics was not what the movie was about.Borrowing from just about every action film out there, HOODWINKED really works. Everything from THE MATRIX to CITY SLICKERS is referenced ...and it's done very well. The animation seems nearly old-fashioned and out-of-date, which actually adds a quaint quality to the film; it's not trying too hard to be something it isn't. It isn't FINDING NEMO or SHREK. It couldn't be with a budget only a fraction of what those two animation goliaths cost. This is an independent film (gotta love 'em!), so money is stretched thin. Which leads me to my next point ... When the film was put out at theaters (in limited release), it didn't have the marketing budget that Pixar and Disney had for theirs. Professional reviews were cool (to say the least), which leads me to wonder if this movie had been put out by Disney or Pixar what the reviews might have been like. With action figures at Toys-R-Us, computer games, posters, and God only knows what else, the financial ability of the production company might have weighed heavy on the minds of reviewers and how children (and adults) viewed it. Trust me, this IS an issue. Independent films struggle under the shadow of these huge film companies.And here's the thing: this movie is GOOD. It's not perfect by any means, but it's fun, light, engaging, voiced well, animated fine, and uproariously entertaining. I especially enjoyed Twitchy the speed-talking squirrel whose brush with caffeine addiction makes for some of the funnier moments. I also liked Japeth the singing Goat, who takes a ride with Little Red through a mine that looks suspiciously like the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad attraction at Disneyland.

976916,A245FDGAV2C3KW,B000EQ5UHI,Jonathan Musere,"[0, 0]","Directed by David Cory, ""Hoodwinked,"" is a computer animated film, a humor and mystery reconstruction (""Rashomon Effect"") of the classic fable of Little Red Riding Hood. Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) and Detective Bill Stork (Anthony Anderson) investigate a domestic disturbance at Granny's (Glenn Close) cottage, involving a karate-kicking Red Riding Hood (Anne Hathaway), a sarcastic wolf (Patrick Warburton) and an oafish Woodsman (Jim Belushi). The charges include breaking and entering, intent to eat, wielding an axe without a license; but these unusual suspects have their individual story to tell first. Exaggerated and unrealistic (and unexpected) features such as talking and singing animals are often used in generating humor and laughter.""Hoodwinked,"" is a delightfully refreshing and funny animated reconstruction on the classic fairy tale ""Little Red Riding Hood."" The story opens with Little Red Riding Hood journeying to visit her Grandmother in the forest. This opening sequence ends with a dramatic confrontation between Red, the Wolf, the Woodsman, and Grandma, just as the police arrive. The rest of the story is a Rashomon-like re-telling of the story from the conflicting points of view of the main characters under police interrogation. The main characters turn out to be far more complex than we were led to believe in childhood. Finally, the truth is revealed and it is quite different and far more sinister than anyone anticipated. The story takes place in the 1970's, illustrated by aspects like bell-bottoms and kung-fu fighting during a cellular-phone free and personal computer free period. The humor is aimed at a general audience of both adults and children, although that opinion depends on who is watching...given the simultaneous presence of child-like characters alongside adult-like mystery and humor.The police arrive at Granny Pucket's (Glen Close) cottage in the woods to answer a domestic disturbance call. However, Red (Ann Hathaway), Granny, the Big Bad Wolf (Patrick Warburton), the Woodsman (James Belushi), and Twitchy the squirrel are not your average suspects. Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) and Inspector Flippers (David Oden Spears) interrogate them. The suspects emerge as full of their own dark secrets, they are wily and deceptive, their accounts of how they all wound up at grandma's about the crime are conflicting. They each tell their side of the story regarding the mysterious disappearances of special recipes from every bakery and store in town. The police have already decided that Little Red Riding Hood, The Wolf, Woodsman and Granny are co-conspirators in the case of the ""Goodie Bandit."" Can hearing four different tales lead to the real Goodie Bandit? The ""Goodie Bandit,"" ought to be uncovered, even if it could turn out to be the cute and cuddly local rabbit Boingo (Andy Dick). The detectives learn, as they interview the participants and get each one's perspective, that Granny is not so helpless, Red may have been doing more than just visiting relatives, the Wolf isn't the predator he has been cranked up to be, and the Woodman is not that much more intelligent than the trees he chops down. Twitchy is the caffeine-addicted, hyperactive and fast talking but lovable squirrel, and she steals the show. Red is bold and clever, but still maintains a girlish innocence. Granny is tough as nails far-fetched from the usual symbol of elderly weakness.The mad mountain goat Japeth has various horn attachments for all his needs, including one for opening bottles. The catchy little tune he sings sticks in the mind, for quite a long time. Japeth is unforgettable, he takes a ride with Little Red through a mine. Japeth is blind and he yodels! This is alongside many other pretty funny situations and one-liners in the movie. One is bound to roar with laughter during the scenes with Japeth the Goat. Japeth is under a curse to always sing, and he quite often uses his horns to swing things around. Indeed, the funniest part movie is this Red's encounter with Japeth the Goat. The best lines in the movie are the cursed goat's verse, ""There is an avalanche a-coming, and I do not feel prepared!"" and ""Since I have to sing everything, I' will just yodel till we are creamed!"" Rather than being a regular variation on an old children's classic tale of Red Riding Hood, in the film you get the tale through the eyes of many of the participants before, at the end, you fully decipher what is really going on. Granny turns out to be a famous 'goodie' maker and Red is her delivery-girl. As the stories unwind everything makes sense all connecting in very clever and sometimes hysterical ways. Quite clever and humorous! ""Hoodwinked"" doesn't really try to push any particular message or theme, but it does crank up the humor meter to the top.Red, tired of the same routine, wants to get out of the forest. But she is aware of who she is and how important it is to keep her job, especially given that her Grandma held it prior to her. Red does not easily give in to anyone though, and will put up a fight if provoked. Her Grandma, while keeping her usual job of selling baked goods, is also sick of her same routine, and does not want to the role of the average grandma. She delves into skydiving, snow boarding, and several other heavy-action activities. The Wolf is a pretty interesting character- voiced by the guy who plays the handicapped cop on Family Guy, usually talking in a calm voice regardless of the situation. He's teamed up with a demented squirrel who should never be given coffee to balance out his coolness. The Woodsman is so big and dumb, yet quite lovable. His song about schnitzels is one to remember, as is everything he does. In addition to such memorable characters, little humorous things are endless. Characters like the mountain goat have been mentioned. Another memorable scene is where the squirrel talks so fast that he can hardly be understood! The police turn to using  voice recorder to record him, then slow down the tape to intelligible speed. It turns out that the squirrel's voice is very clear, deep and calm, and it is humorous. The squirrel is intrigued with his voice and tone on the slowed-down taping.The movie is a reminder to leave one's stereotypes behind and listen to the facts and issues before judging and making conclusions. Hence it is not the Big Bad Wolf that is always the guilty one; rather, the cute innocent bunny can turn out to be the bad boy. Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) was immediately suspicious of the Wolf, but Nicky Flippers was wise enough to interview all the suspects. Evidently it is not as it seems. The Wolf is actually an investigative reporter looking into the Goody Bandit case. The woodsman is a schnitzel truck driver who dreams of being an actor. Granny is an extreme sports enthusiast. And just what does Boingo (Andy Dick), a cute bunny seemingly everywhere, have to do with it all? Well, it's a tricky case but if someone could break it, it's Nicky Flippers. Actually, to many it was  pretty obvious who the culprit was but that does not rid us of the laughter the film generates.",5,Duped!,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,7101,"['Directed', 'David', 'Cory',

976917,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000EQ5UHI,Joseph Haschka,"[1, 7]","Unless you're ten years old or less, you might think you've been had if you buy or rent HOODWINKED.Based on the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, this animated feature begins as Red (Anne Hathaway) discovers the Wolf (Patrick Warburton) in Granny's bed, Granny herself (Glenn Close) being tied up in the closet. As the situation begins to escalate out of control, the Woodsman (James Belushi) crashes through the window brandishing an axe. The next thing the audience sees is Granny's house roped off with yellow crime scene tape and the four principals, now in the custody of several animal policemen for disturbing the peace, being questioned by the lead investigator, frog Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers).Under interrogation by Flippers, each detainee tells his/her version of what led up to the confrontation in Granny's bedroom. As the pages of HOODWINKED literally flip back to the beginning four different times, we learn that (apparently) the Wolf is an investigative reporter, the Woodsman an actor wannabee, Granny a snow boarding enthusiast, and Red Riding Hood simply a deliverer of edible goodies. Indeed, there's a larger subplot, which is that the forest's various goodie manufacturer's are being put out of business by the theft of their recipes by an unknown perp; Granny is the last holdout.Conceptually, this approach has promise; I can see it successfully applied to a modern re-telling of any classic fable that you'd care to mention. Unfortunately, the story writers went over the top revamping the traditional plot and the action becomes embarrassingly silly. At times, the viewer might think he's watching two different films grafted on to each other. Only the Wolf remains particularly engaging from beginning to end; Warburton's voice performance is perfect for the role.An infinitely more clever and endearing film was 2005's WALLACE & GROMIT: CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT.

Eric started a school called Transactional Analysis, but since most people don't like to say that, he called it TA.  And in this school he started, he looked at how people interacted with each other.  He thought that there were other, new, and interesting ways to look at those interactions, so he analyzed them--hence the name.One of the things he looked at was fairy tales, and the one he analyzed most was Little Red Riding Hood.  It was part of a book he wrote called ""What Do You Say After You Say Hello?""

976919,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000EQ5UHI,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 7]","""Hoodwinked"" takes the classic story of Little Red Riding Hood and basically turns it into a version of Law & Order. The movie didn't get good reviews, but it's actually pretty damn funny and entertaining. The animation is pretty good too, these animated characters look better than Scooby-Doo and Garfield look. In the beginning, we're introduced to Red (Anne Hathaway, 'Brokeback Mountain') who is heading to her Granny's (Glenn Close, 'Fatal Attraction') house to drop off some food. When she gets there she encounters The Wolf (Patrick Warburton, TV's 'Family Guy') dressed in a suit to look like her Granny. Soon after, The Woodsman (Jim Belushi, TV's 'According to Jim') burst in wielding an axe. Minutes later, the police arrive to begin interrogation. At first we meet a couple cops, Detective Stork (Anthony Anderson, 'Kangaroo Jack') and Chief Grizzly (Xzibit, TV's 'Pimp My Ride'), but the investigation is soon led by Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Steirs). In case I hadn't made it clear, both humans and animals interact in this world. Anyway, as interrogation begins they're given four different tales of how everyone wound up at Granny's house and it's all very interesting. It's a completely different spin on Little Red Riding Hood and it's the best version I've ever seen of it. All the voice work is great; Even the usually annoying Andy Dick lends his voice to Boingo, a cute little bunny. But Anne Hathaway is perfect as red; Both Jim Belushi & Glenn Close sound unrecognizable. Patrick Warburton is perfect giving voiceovers, he has a great voice. Xzibit, Anthony Anderson, and David Ogden Steirs are perfect as cops...And to top all this off, this movie can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. There's few innuendos, but a lot of references adults will notice (a few of the cops are pigs, etc.) Anyway, despite various reports, this is a charming and semi-funny but very enjoyable movie. If you liked Shrek or other movies like that then definitely check this out.GRADE: A",5,Smart,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,1993,"['Hoodwinked', 'classic', 'story', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'basically', 'version', 'Law', 'Order', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'reviews', 'actually', 'pretty', 'damn', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'animated', 'characters', 'look', 'better', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Garfield', 'look', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Red', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Mountain', 'who', 'heading', 'Granny', 'Glenn', 'Close', ""'Fatal"", 'Attraction', 'house', 'drop', 'off', 'food', 'When', 'there', 'Wolf', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'TV', ""'Family"", 'Guy', 'dressed', 'suit', 'look', 'Granny', 'Soon', 'Woodsman', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'TV', ""'According"", 'Jim', 'burst', 'wielding', 'axe', 'Minutes', 'later', 'police', 'arrive', 'begin', 'interrogation', 'first', 'meet', 'couple', 'cops', 'Detective', 'Stork', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', ""'Kangaroo"", 'Jack', 'Chief', 'Grizzly', 'Xzibit', 'TV', 'My', 'Ride', 'investigation', 'soon', 'led', 'Nicky', 'Flippers', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Steirs', 'case', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'clear', 'humans', 'animals', 'interact', 'world', 'Anyway', 'interrogation', ""'re"", 'given', 'four', 'different', 'tales', 'how', 'everyone', 'wound', 'up', 'Granny', 'house', 'very', 'interesting', 'completely', 'different', 'spin', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'best', 'version', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'voice', 'work', 'great', 'Even', 'usually', 'annoying', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'voice', 'Boingo', 'cute', 'little', 'bunny', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'perfect', 'red', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'sound', 'unrecognizable', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'perfect', 'giving', 'voiceovers', 'great', 'voice', 'Xzibit', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Steirs', 'are', 'perfect', 'cops', 'top', 'off', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'kids', 'adults', 'few', 'innuendos', 'lot', 'references', 'adults', 'will', 'notice', 'few', 'cops', 'are', 'pigs', 'etc', 'Anyway', 'various', 'reports', 'charming', 'semi-funny', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'liked', 'Shrek', 'other', 'movies', 'then', 'definitely', 'check', 'out.GRADE']",N/A

I watched this film with a bunch of kids and they were all more than capable of understanding what was going on and I'd say this movie is far more kid friendly than Shrek so I don't understand the criticism it gets in that regard.There's no hiding that the CGI quality in this film isn't up to par with other studios out there like Pixar but the story and the way it tells the story is every bit as good. The story is that of Little Red Riding Hood only modified to turn it in to a sort of ""who done it?"" which is told through the eyes of each major player to fit it all together. The mystery portion really isn't that hard to put together, but it is a kids movie and even though you can figure out who the villian is it's still fun to see it all come together.The voice acting is very well done, especially Anne Hathaway as Red and Patrick Warburton as the Wolf. The movie also contains a good bit of original music, most of which is very well done and some of it is even very catchy.In the end, while the animation isn't exactly top notch it is still effective and well done and the rest easily makes up for the shortcomings of the animation. It's a great movie for both adults and kids alike and I really don't think kids will have any trouble following along, at most they may simply miss a few jokes aimed at an older audience. It's not Pixar or Dreamworks, and unfortunately it gets a lot of flack from fans of those studios due to that alone, but it's just as good aside from the animation quality which does the job even if it isn't as stellar.",5,"Not a masterpiece of CGI by any stretch, but still a very fun flick",1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1631,"['Great', 'take', 'classic', 'tale', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'children', 'watched', 'film', 'bunch', 'kids', 'were', 'more', 'capable', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'kid', 'friendly', 'Shrek', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'criticism', 'hiding', 'CGI', 'quality', 'film', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'other', 'studios', 'there', 'Pixar', 'story', 'way', 'story', 'bit', 'good', 'story', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'only', 'modified', 'turn', 'sort', 'who', 'done', 'told', 'eyes', 'major', 'player', 'fit', 'together', 'mystery', 'portion', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'put', 'together', 'kids', 'movie', 'even', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'villian', 'still', 'fun', 'see', 'come', 'together.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Red', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'Wolf', 'movie', 'also', 'good', 'bit', 'original', 'music', 'most', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'very', 'end', 'animation', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'top', 'notch', 'still', 'effective', 'well', 'done', 'rest', 'easily', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'animation', 'great', 'movie', 'adults', 'kids', 'alike', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kids', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'along', 'most', 'may', 'simply', 'miss', 'few', 'jokes', 'aimed', 'older', 'audience', 'not', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks', 'unfortunately', 'lot', 'flack', 'fans', 'studios', 'due', 'alone', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'aside', 'animation', 'quality', 'job', 'even', ""n't"", 'stellar']",N/A

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","What do you get when you combine a traditional Grimm Fairy Tale with extreme sports, a goodie heist, and street cred?  ""Hoodwinked,"" that's what.  ""Hoodwinked"" is a hilarious re-telling of the old ""Little Red Riding Hood"" story.  I had my doubts when I first entered the movie theater, especially since many critics hammered it.  However, and as in most cases, the professional critics were wrong.  This family comedy will have everyone laughing in the aisles.  There are plenty of things in this film to laugh at for youngsters, teens, and oldsters alike.The tale starts off traditionally enough, with ""Little Red"" going to visit her dear sweet Granny in the forest.  However, things happen along the way that just don't add up.  Once we get to the climax of the traditional tale, all chaos cuts loose.  There is a domestic disturbance called into the police, all of which happen to be animals.  Mr. Flippers, a frog, investigates the crime and somehow ties it to a recent string of goodie recipe thefts.One by one we are re-told the tale by Red, Granny, the Woodsman, and, of course, the Big Bad Wolf.  Each tale neatly ties up any loose ends from the previous tale.  We get to see the tale from all four points of view.  In the end, all of the tales are tied together with one thing in mind, and, honestly, most adults will probably pick up on this from the beginning.Younger kids may not be able to tie all of the ends together, but there are plenty of silly laughs for them.  The story never slows down, and I have to admit that it's one of the funniest comedies, live-action or animated, in a long while.Anne Hathaway provides the voice of Red.  She does quite well with this departure from the prim and proper princess roles she's well known for.  Glenn Close is Granny in a hilarious twist on the sweet ol' coot.  Patrick Warburton plays the Wolf, and he and his squirrel companion steal the show.  The Woodsman is portrayed by Jim Belushi.  Other surprises in this flick are Andy Dick, Anthony Anderson, and Xzibit.Overall, this is a wonderful film to take the entire family to see.

Then we see a tied up Grandma fall out of closet and a Woodsman break through the window. Next thing you know the cops show up and cool the situation down. The movie then enters an interrogation type mode in which they question Red, Wolf, Grandma, and the Woodsman. You soon learn that a goody thief is on the loose. The story revolves around trying to figure out who he or she is.This story is extremely well done and enjoyable to watch. Hearing four different perspectives of what happened is very entertaining and gives a special feel to the story. It's obvious to anyone over ten to realize who the goody thief is by about the third story but that doesn't damper the story any.The animation isn't the best out there, but it is pretty well done. I'm glad they focused more on the story instead of realism. Still, the animation isn't ugly by any means. You can still see every hair in Wolf. Other characters have good designs that make them different than every other character in this movie.Extra are your standard deleted scenes, commentary track, and making of features. The deleted scenes are mostly just extended versions of musical parts of the movie. Other deleted scenes are drawn out pictures. This is pretty cool, but doesn't qualify as a great deleted scene to me. The commentary is pretty good and so is the making of.Don't worry about this movie being too childish for you. My 50-year-old father was even laughing at it while we watched it. It has a very funny story with not too many musical scenes to slow you down. I would recommend that anyone of any age pick up this wonderful movie.",5,Wasn't expecting this...,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,2085,"['HoodwinkedAfter', 'success', 'ofShrekand', 'many', 'Pixar', 'films', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'was', 'just', 'throwing', 'out', 'computer-animated', 'movie', 'could', 'make', 'None', 'could', 'capture', 'feeling', 'Pixar', 'Shrek', 'give', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Hoodwinked', 'delivered', 'nearly', 'single', 'level.Hoodwinked', 'retelling', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'movie', 'scene', 'Red', 'going', 'home', 'visit', 'grandmother', 'only', 'find', 'wolf', 'disguised', 'grandmother', 'Then', 'see', 'tied', 'up', 'Grandma', 'fall', 'closet', 'Woodsman', 'break', 'window', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'cops', 'show', 'up', 'cool', 'situation', 'down', 'movie', 'then', 'interrogation', 'type', 'mode', 'question', 'Red', 'Wolf', 'Grandma', 'Woodsman', 'soon', 'learn', 'goody', 'thief', 'loose', 'story', 'around', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'is.This', 'story', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Hearing', 'four', 'different', 'perspectives', 'what', 'happened', 'very', 'entertaining', 'special', 'feel', 'story', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'over', 'realize', 'who', 'goody', 'thief', 'third', 'story', ""n't"", 'damper', 'story', 'any.The', 'animation', ""n't"", 'best', 'there', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', ""'m"", 'glad', 'focused', 'more', 'story', 'instead', 'realism', 'Still', 'animation', ""n't"", 'ugly', 'means', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'hair', 'Wolf', 'Other', 'characters', 'have', 'good', 'designs', 'make', 'different', 'other', 'character', 'movie.Extra', 'are', 'standard', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'track', 'making', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'just', 'extended', 'versions', 'musical', 'parts', 'movie', 'Other', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'drawn', 'out', 'pictures', 'pretty', 'cool', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'great', 'deleted', 'scene', 'commentary', 'pretty', 'good', 'so', 'making', 'of.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'childish', '50-year-old', 'father', 'was', 'even', 'laughing', 'watched', 'very', 'funny', 'story', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'musical', 'scenes', 'slow', 'down', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'age', 'pick', 'up', 'wonderful', 'movie']",N/A

Bernabo,"[5, 6]","I remember hearing a version of the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears where she makes her way through the three bowls of porridge and the three chairs, to make her way upstairs to the three beds.  In the Baby Bear's bed she discovers a wolf dressed up as grandma.  They do the whole ""What big eyes you have"" routine and the wolf gobbles down Goldilocks.  We should not be surprised by this turn of events because, after all, this was a two story house... (add rim shot here).""Hoodwinked"" is decidedly in the same mold as that story.  Actually, the basic point of this version of Little Red Riding Hood is that there are (at least) four stories to be told, because in addition to Red and the Wolf, there is Grandma (bound in the closet instead of in the Wolf's belly), and the crazy Woodsman with his axe.  The police want to know what is going on and that means Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers), a long-legged frog, and Chief Grizzly (Xzbit), a bear, need to question the four principles one by one to get to the bottom of it all.  Just think of it as ""Rashomon"" played out by Mother Goose.Red Riding Hood (Anne Hathaway) tells her version first, which is close to the original.  But then we have have the Big Bad Wolf (Patrick Warburton), who turns out to be an undercover reporter, the Woodsman (James Belushi), who is has been selling schnitzel when he wants to be in show business, and Granny (Glenn Close), who is into X-sports when she is not baking goodies.  In fact, the underlying question in all of these misadventures seems to be the mysterious ""Goody Bandit.""Actually, the supporting characters of this fractured fairey tale come across as being more interesting, especially Twitchy (Cory Edwards), Japeth the Goat (Benjy Gaither), and Boingo (Andy Dick).  Todd Edwards & Cory Edwards came up with the story and the screenplay, and co-directed this animated film along with Tony Leech, and they certainly make a effort to push every button they can think of when it comes to working in references to fairy tales and pop culture.

(And, I loved both Shrek movies and Ice Age.)1.  It seemed that all the characters were arrogant jerks.  That is, until the goat.  I loved the goat, and the number about being prepared was funny, especially with all the sight gags using his horns.  Other than that, the main characters all seemed rude and vulgar, like they'd be spewing obscenities if they were just being themselves and not living in a movie aimed at the family audience.2.  Since they were mostly all jerks, there was very little contrast between the characters and thus little chemestry between them either.3.  The pacing was frantic and random.  It seemed like there were no scenes that lasted more than a few seconds.  Just one forced verbal gag or sight gag after another.Anyway, if you really want to see this film I'd suggest renting it once it's no longer a new release and you can keep it for three days for a couple of bucks.

The animation may not be state of the art but when the story is this creative and funny, who cares? The voiceovers are very well done and the plot moves along nicely; I didn't feel bored and the plot twists helped make the story engaging. Great!The action actually begins near the end of the story so the film is essentially a flashback. It seems that a little girl named Red (voiced by Anne Hathaway) is on her way to visit her grandmother (voiced by Glenn Close) in the forest. She meets the wolf (voiced by Patrick Warburton); and Red mistakenly thinks the wolf is trying to harm her. Red also has some quality time with her friend Boingo the rabbit (voiced by Andy Dick) who is sadly almost completely out of work. Red's granny is inexplicably tied up in her closet when Red arrives; and the wolf is wearing a granny disguise in granny's own bed! And why is there a woodsman (voiced by Jim Belushi) crashing through granny's window screaming and wielding an axe? There is much to straighten out here.Meanwhile, there's another plot of great importance. There's a ""bandit"" who has been stealing all of the recipes for goodies and nobody can figure out who the criminal is! When Police Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) arrives with other police officers including Detective Bill Stork (voiced by Anthony Anderson), an investigation begins--but it is interrupted and pushed aside by the suave, debonair detective Nicky Flippers the frog (voiced by David Ogden Stiers).Flippers has everyone tell their version of the story: Red's granny, Red herself, the wolf and the woodsman. Of course, we learn more about what happens from each and every version of the story that we get--but still we are not quite close to solving the puzzle of just who is the recipe thief even after all their testimony. That's when Nicky Flippers, Red and even Granny get involved with a most unlikely thief; and when trouble starts and Red's life is on suddenly on the line it's soon up to Granny and some others to help her!Of course, from here the plot can go just about anywhere. Who IS the ""goodie bandit"" and what is their ultimate goal? Will Red's friends be able to rescue her in time; and why has Red's grandmother kept some pretty big secrets from her? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!The DVD comes with some nice bonus features. We get deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary; a feature commentary by writer/director Cory Edwards, writer/co-director Tony Leech and writer/co-director Todd Edwards; a music video and more!Hoodwinked is a film for just about anyone who likes humorous movies that are actually funny, except maybe small children who might be frightened or upset by a few scenes that aren't exactly the happiest.

Why I don't know. Granted I haven't seen it, but my Dad loves films like that, so no doubt I'll be watching it at some point. Shrek is so packed full of injokes, and references to movies, that even most of it goes over my head, never mind the audience it's aimed at.Hoodwinked pretty much passed me by when it was originally released in the cinemas in the UK. All I remember thinking is that it looked interesting, and a very good concept, and then I promptly forgot all about it. But then I got it as a present, and yes, it seemed to grab my attention more. It was made for a much lower budget than the silly money that's thrown at stuff like Shrek etc these days, but there is no visual difference. To me anyway.To start with, I was very disappointed. I couldn't follow the storyline, but then it all started to click in, the little bits that are pointed out to you, that makes you go ""aaaahhhh"". I didn't spot as many injokes, they're not so in-your-face as for example Shrek, and one I was already told about (the Wolf basically being Fletch). I didn't spot the Kill Bill reference, mainly because I haven't seen it.It's full of more memorable characters as well, not characters who you'll only remember for who voiced them more than anything else. Judging by my title for this, I loved Twitchy. I had the subtitles on so I could understand what he was meant to be saying, and each time I found it funnier than the previous time.It's a really engaging story for both young and old, but unfortunately, with the days of Shrek, Cars etc upon us, it will be sadly overlooked. But it's a wee gem to be picked up and laughed over. Definitely a must. But a singing/yodelling goat?! Who sits on his horns?!

And Grandma, Little Red Riding Hood, the Wolf and the Lumberjack were all taken into custody and questioned?  That's exactly the premise of HOODWINKED, a new movie from a new animation studio on the block that's kicking furry tail and taking names.  Conducted like a police investigation into the mysterious burglaries that are putting Goodie businesses out of operation, HOODWINKED sails through a storyline that is filled with great humor and pratfalls.  All four suspects are questioned by Nicky Flippers, the frog who conducts the interviews, and all of them have surprising secrets to reveal.  And the bad guy is still out there waiting in the wings.Kanbar Entertainment was born when the talented people who brought this movie into the world gathered.  Cory and Todd Edwards (DOOGLE) wrote and directed, Tony Leech (DOOGLE) wrote.  Glenn Close, Jim Belushi, Anne Hathaway, Patrick Warburton, Andy Dick, David Ogden Stiers, Xzibit, Chazz Palminteri and Anthony Anderson did the voices.The best part of HOODWINKED is the way the initial four stories overlap.  The funniest bit in the movie, which the extra features reveal was almost pulled from the end product, is Red's encounter with Japeth the Goat.  The best lines in the movie are the cursed goat's verse, ""There's an avalanche a-coming, and I do not feel prepared!"" and ""Since I have to sing everything, I'll just yodel till we're creamed!""  The story fits together like a Chinese puzzle, with everything hidden within everything else.  The visual aspect, though some may gripe about it not being as smooth as Pixar, absolutely fits the story.The end of the movie didn't quite live up to the buildup.  Unfortunately, that may not have been possible.  The building with the four interwoven stories is just absolute dynamite.HOODWINKED is fun fare for the whole family.  Having kids gives adults a good excuse to watch the movie, but they aren't necessary.

Each tell a variation of what really happened - ergo, the Little Red Riding Hood story. As the detectives interview the participants and get each individual's perspective, they learn that Granny isn't so helpless, Red may have been doing more than just visiting relatives, the Wolf isn't the predator he's been cracked up to be, and the Woodman doesn't have much of an intellectual advantage over the trees he chops down.My word, another ""Shrek"" clone? From the Weinstein brothers? ""Hoodwinked"" had some potential to be great. On one hand, you had an amazing A-list cast you're working with. Then, you have a ""Pulp Fiction""-style plot movement where the stories of the main characters intertwine. But director Cory Edwards (who also doubles as the voice of the squirrel, who gets the movie's major laughs) is too eager to please, and ""Hoodwinked"" becomes another attempt to outdo ""Shrek"". And like all directors, Edwards falls flat.The visuals of ""Hoodwinked"" are surprisingly well-conceived. While it ain't up to the standards ""Shrek"" or ""Finding Nemo"" set, some of the designs are rather sharp. The Wolf has a lot of detail paid attention to its fur, while Red's cape swishes along with the wind.But the movie gets bogged down by a sensory overload of pop culture references. It's not like ""Shark Tale,"" mind you, but the opportunity to crack open some good laugh-getting moments isn't taken. Why does the screenplay, also written by Cory Edwards, have to require tired references to ""Star Wars"" (""Use the hood"", Granny tells Red when she's soaring in the air) and ""The Matrix"" (more slow-mo scenes) that earlier movies have already used and succeeded. And then there's a musical score which sounds like something out of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" which isn't as clever as it is on paper. The only clever moment comes when we run into a spoof of ""xXx,"" where we see Granny compete in a snowboard race and, at the end, blows it up to create an avalanche. Not good stuff, mind you, but better than what else the movie has to offer.This movie also rips off of ""Ella Enchanted,"" another movie star Anne Hathaway done. Yes, our heroine Red knows karate. While Mrs. Hathaway does a good job providing spunk for Red, her character isn't developed enough for us to care when the movie gets serious.Speaking of that, when the movie reaches its finale climax, it's where ""Hoodwinked"" takes a major hit (and Andy Dick, who voices the bunny in the stories, is at his unfunniest). The beginning of the movie, while not producing much laughs, has some utter confidence and making this movie a breezy time. But once it reaches the end, it becomes a full-scale action/adventure where wit is thrown out the window, and the movie begins to drag (spoiler: it's a lame parody of the finale from ""Batman Begins"", or so I think... whatever!)Back to the performances. Glenn Close, fresh from the heyday that was season four of ""The Shield"", does a good job voicing a grandmother with a secret. Warburton is usually reliable in various situations, especially when he shares the scenes with Twitchy the squirrel. Jim Belushi sadly phones in his performance and comes off as a bad imitation of Shrek, but with a German accent. The rest of the cast includes David Ogden Stiers (who, in case you don't know, voiced Jumba in ""Lilo & Stitch"") as Nicky Flippers, and a brief appearance by Chazz Palmintieri as a sheep informant.This is a movie that is saved by spirited performances from Hathaway and Close.

976965,AHF97M45JFCB,B000EQ5UHI,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","In my opinion the fairy tale as source material for an animated feature spans two extremes: On the one end is Shrek (and it's seemingly never ending sequels) and the other are the Happily N'ever After films. Shrek does things properly with an original, witty, and engaging tale in the forefront and classic fairy tale spoofs and references thrown about for good measure.  Better still they often integrate pop culture references with the medieval setting which is humorous by virtue of contrast alone.Happily Ever After went a more direct route in its approach: Take a classic, add a few silly twists and call it something new.  Now in my opinion this is certainly the less desirable of the two extremes.For this story, we begin at the end. Furry and feathered cops from the animal world are investigating a domestic disturbance at Granny's cottage, involving a girl, a wolf, and an axe-wielding madman.The impatient Chief Grizzly arrests them all on the scene while Detective Nicky Flipper interviews the accused to gather each of their own version of the incident and the events leading up to it.What unfolds is a massive conspiracy threatening the entire animal world's economic stability as candy recipes of the goody shops have been stolen by the Goody Bandit, and here in fairy tale land, sweets aren't just snacks, they're the currency of the forest!Hoodwinked falls firmly in the middle of the scale with a tale that starts out as classical material (in this case Little Red Riding Hood) and throws in a wide variety of both cultural and sociological references.  It also makes pretty amusing use of the POV (point of view) method of story telling to weave a singular tale.The laughs aren't constant and the animation is obviously a few notches below what moviegoers have come to expect from the president set by Pixar, DreamWorks, and Blue Sky but that doesn't mean Hoodwinked doesn't shine in its own unique way.The vocal cast for one thing offers up a fantastic variety of appropriate flavors.  Rapper turned reality show television host Xzibit dazzles as the thick-necked Chief Grizzly, Glenn Close delivers the goods as Triple G: The extreme sports addicted granny and Seinfeld's ever-monotonous Patrick Warburton's rendition of the big bad wolf is nothing if not spot-on.The story itself is rife with originality and some interesting twists on the classical tale about a young girl on her way to granny's place.  I can't say I'm particularly enamored with the whole fairy-tale turned modern comedy genre of computer animated feature films but Hoodwinked is solid enough to remind that with enough creativity and heart, an antiquated story can be made into something appreciated by viewers of any age and background.  Perhaps the most impressive aspect about this one is that it manages to play ball with some of the blockbusters in animation on an absolute shoestring budget.

Nice to look at, but boring! Madagascar? A waste of Jada Pinkett Smith's voice talent. Now, I look at these movies, then look at Hoodwinked, my saviour. At first, I was highly sceptical about this film beacause of the poor CGI. I'll admit, the previews were a turnoff. But I said, hey! 'If the graphics are so bad, the movie has to have a catch to it."" And it did. It was hilarious. I haven't laughed at such clever jokes in a long time. The voice acting was terrific. The Wolf had a great dead-pan voice that totally suited him, Anne Hathaway and Glenn Close did good jobs as Red and Granny. I love EVERY character. Each were delightful, even the squirrel who, surprisingly, didn't annoy me. Trust me, kids AND adults will love this show. My neighbour's kid had such a great time when he ""figured out"" that the criminal was the Bunny. I mean, people our age would know it instantly, but let the kids work it out themselves. It's a great morale boost for sure. In the end, Hoodwinked is a great example that a movie doesn't have to be flashy to be wonderful. It's like an indie flick.

From watching Granny surf a twenty foot wave, to seeing just what it is the wolf and his faithful side kick do for a living. The plot line does keep to what actually happened on that day when little red riding hood's legend began, but on the back side, there is a recipe snatcher on the loose, and no recipe is safe from its cluches! Augh! the humanity of it all... Will the forst band together and finally knab that recipe snatcher? Or will it continue its rampage until there are no secret recipes left!?This movie had me laughing out loud in more than a few parts, and gave me a faint pain in my side in scenes with the singing goat [you'll find out]. All in all, a great fun filled family movie. The best since Any disney cartoon production in the past 5 years in my opinion. Don't be fooled by the independent lable, this is a very well done movie. It deserves a place on the shelf of any home dvd collection.Beware of watching this movie with preconceptions of this being the next shrek, or incredibles or any other CGI movie out there. This is an independent film that deserves alot of recognition not only because of how well it was done, but also because of the cleanliness it held, and still came off as... intelligently hilarious. Sure it's not all that to teenagers, but it might be to mom, dad and the under 10 group. Anyone else who understands clean humor will find this movie humorous as well, just don't watch it thinking it's geared towards adolesence... Because you will be disapointed.This is a kids movie, plain and simple. And being a kids movie, it is a very well done kids movie [not to mention it is an independant film, which rarely are worth mentioning]. I enjoyed watching a movie with clean humor for once, though I wouldnt watch this movie all the time, it was fun to just sit back and relax, and watch a kiddie movie. A great funny, family friendly film. Beware of the fact that some of the jokes are corny, the rest are witty, sarcastic, and some just plain funny sometimes.If you're scared, then rent it, you won't be disapointed in doing that.

976981,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000EQ5UHI,Terry Mesnard,"[2, 3]","This indie animated flick is like most indie films, a little rough around the edges, a little different than the run of the norm, and endlessly clever.  I think its a bit unfair to label it as a Shrek-type film.  True, the humor is a bit more adult, while also giving some humor for kids to enjoy; however, the humor itself is a bit more subtle and doesn't rely on poop and fart jokes.What I loved most about the film was its presentation of the story.  It begins almost Quentin Tarantino like by showing the ending.  Red, the wolf, the granny and the woodsman all end up the Granny's house.  But what really happened?  Who is behind this?  Is everything as it seems?  I love stories that do this.  From The Simpson's episode involving one day in the life of the townspeople, to Pulp Fiction and even Go, these stories always make me smile to see how everything fits together.  Hoodwinked is no different.  Finding the truth to what really happened and why everyone was amassed at Granny's house is clever, funny and original for a cartoon.  One complaint was that I figured out who the ""mastermind"" behind everything was from the very beginning.  However, its not really that important and the ride is entertaining the entire way.The humor, like I said, is usually a little more subtle than what we're normally used to in kid's flicks.  Yes there are some pratfalls and over-the-top style moments; but the true humor rests in some clever one liners and some of the songs and events.  In particular, the lyrics to Red is Blue is terrific and had me and my friend rolling in the aisles.  There are some pop-culture references, but what Hoodwinked did really well was play with conventions, introduce some terrific characters and use an excellent voice cast that includes Glenn Close, Anne Hathaway, Andy Dick (who I normally hate but is perfect in this role), James Belushi and regular voice actor for Family guy Patrick Warburton.Hoodwinked also slyly presents a moral for its viewers, one that is important not only for children but also adults.  Sometimes, things aren't always as they appear.  Don't judge a book by its cover because if you look a bit closer you will find the truth.  Hoodwinked's animation might not be up to the standards of Pixar or even Dreamworks, but behind its rough around the edges exterior lies a movie that is hillariously witty, subtle and heart-warming.",5,Indie Animated Film a must see,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,2386,"['indie', 'animated', 'flick', 'most', 'indie', 'films', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'little', 'different', 'run', 'norm', 'endlessly', 'clever', 'think', 'bit', 'unfair', 'label', 'Shrek-type', 'film', 'True', 'humor', 'bit', 'more', 'adult', 'also', 'giving', 'humor', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'however', 'humor', 'bit', 'more', 'subtle', ""n't"", 'rely', 'poop', 'fart', 'jokes.What', 'loved', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'presentation', 'story', 'almost', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'showing', 'ending', 'Red', 'wolf', 'granny', 'woodsman', 'end', 'up', 'Granny', 'house', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Who', 'everything', 'love', 'stories', 'do', 'Simpson', 'episode', 'involving', 'one', 'day', 'life', 'townspeople', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'even', 'Go', 'stories', 'always', 'make', 'smile', 'see', 'how', 'everything', 'together', 'Hoodwinked', 'different', 'Finding', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'why', 'everyone', 'was', 'amassed', 'Granny', 'house', 'clever', 'funny', 'original', 'cartoon', 'One', 'complaint', 'was', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'mastermind', 'everything', 'was', 'very', 'beginning', 'However', 'not', 'really', 'important', 'ride', 'entertaining', 'entire', 'way.The', 'humor', 'said', 'usually', 'little', 'more', 'subtle', 'what', ""'re"", 'normally', 'used', 'kid', 'flicks', 'are', 'pratfalls', 'over-the-top', 'style', 'moments', 'true', 'humor', 'rests', 'clever', 'one', 'liners', 'songs', 'events', 'particular', 'lyrics', 'Red', 'Blue', 'terrific', 'had', 'friend', 'rolling', 'aisles', 'are', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'what', 'Hoodwinked', 'did', 'really', 'well', 'was', 'play', 'conventions', 'introduce', 'terrific', 'characters', 'use', 'excellent', 'voice', 'cast', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'who', 'normally', 'hate', 'perfect', 'role', 'James', 'Belushi', 'regular', 'voice', 'actor', 'Family', 'guy', 'Patrick', 'Warburton.Hoodwinked', 'also', 'slyly', 'presents', 'moral', 'viewers', 'one', 'important', 'not', 'only', 'children', 'also', 'adults', 'Sometimes', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'appear', 'Do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'look', 'bit', 'closer', 'will', 'find', 'truth', 'Hoodwinked', 'animation', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'standards', 'Pixar', 'even', 'Dreamworks', 'rough', 'edges', 'exterior', 'movie', 'hillariously', 'witty', 'subtle', 'heart-warming']",N/A

Also, you may find some part of the film is similar to other animated films - how many times have we seen a fast-talking squirrel running around, for example - but other funnier characters and clever script will make up for that unoriginality.The film opens with the famous scene of the famous tale, where Red Riding Hood encounters a big bad wolf in her Grandma's house. But another character wielding an ace breaks into the room, which leads to the police investigation led by a frog inspector who is dressed and talks like characters from the 1930s crime suspense. The wacky humor and numerous pop culture references (including such hits from ""XXX"" to ""Kill Bill"") may not appeal to some viewers, but I enjoyed watching most part of them for what they are, the singing goat in particular. Interesting thing about the film is that it does not contain any gross-out gags. The humor of this fast-paced film is closer to that of Looney Toons.[CHARACTER DESIGNS] The animation characters of ""Hoodwinked"" may not be the ""prettiest"" ones that I have seen in recent years. They need more polishing up (and budget), especially when showing the human characters on screen. The facial expressions of Red and Grandma need to be more colorful, but I think this has something to do with the basic designs of them, not exactly the budget as some reviewers say.

In that classic story, Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandma are both eaten by a wicked wolf, but are saved by the Woodsman as he cuts open the wolf's stomach while it sleeps. Red and Grandma escape and they replace themselves with hugh rocks. When the wolf awakes and sees what happens he tries to get them, but his heavy stomach makes him an enemy no more.Well, as can see from SHREK or from reading some fractured fairy tales, that might not always be the case. In HOODWINKED it turns out that Red is the delivery girl for her Grandma. Grandma is a world famous chef and is one of only a handful of individuals who hasn't been put out of business by a recipe thief. When Red arrives at Granny's she see right through the wolf's disguise, but before anyone can do anything Granny pops out of the closet all tied up and the Woodsman come crashing through the wall with a giant log. When the police arrives, an brilliant inspector attempts to unravel the mystery and find out exactly who's stealing all the recipes.For the most part, critics have been panning HOODWINKED while audiences have loved it. The film does make a lot of references from everything to SHREK to THE MATRIX to the famous Japanese film, RASHOMON.  Some might find thie allusions dizzying.  I enjoyed them.  Not only that, but I loved the story. I figured out about 5 minutes into the movie who the real thief was, yet that didn't diminish the film for me in anyway. I got caught up in the storytelling and wanted to see how things would end up. The movie sets things up so there could be a sequel.

To date this field has been dominated by pioneering Pixar (Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles), close 2nd Dreamworks (Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar), with 20th Century Animation (Robots and Ice Age) as third entrant.  From a computer animation standpoint no one yet beats Pixar, although 20th Century Animation is a close second.  Blue Yonder really has a ways to go before they even come close to Pixar's pioneering Toy Story.  The animation in Hoodwinked is not all that good compared to Pixar, 20th Century or even Dreamworks.However, no amount of animation can make up for a horrible story and unappealling characters (Chicken Little, Shark Tale and Robots, for example), and a great story and characters can make up for 2nd rate animation (Shrek).  Hoodwinked benefits from having a great story and a couple of really funny characters.  The story is of Little Red Riding Hood, but in this world, little Red Riding Hood finds the wolf disguised as her granny, her granny tied up in the closet and as the woodsman crashes through the window ax in hand, the police show up at granny's cottage on a domestic violence call.Each of the four characters has a different story to relate and are interviewed one at a time by the chief detective.  The stories interlock, for example, the track outage in Red Riding Hood's mine adventure is caused earlier by the Wolf and his sidekick, Twitchy the squirrel, in an hilarious sequence.  (""What kind of candles are those?""  ""Deen-o-mite-tay, sounds like an Italian brand"").Suffice it to say that once the stories have been told, the villain of the piece is discovered and a hair raising adventure ends the film.The characters and the lines are what make the movie though.  It's very much like the Shrek films in that some of the lines children will not understand completely, but the lines aren't quite as adult as some of the ones in the Shrek films.  The biggest failing of the movie is that the animation really should have been better.  Either Pixar or Dreamworks would have done a much better job with the animation.All in all, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie laughing out loud several times as I watched it.  The wolf is hilarious, the detective is really good and Twitchy the squirell is a riot.  I'd give it 5 stars if the animation was a little bit better.

Visuals draw the viewers eye, and act as a buffer for terrible movies.(i.e. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Visually stunning...that's it...).Hoodwinked lacked in the visuals area. In fact, when I saw the trailers, I myself didn't think it would be worth seeing based on the quality of CG. After seeing the movie (twice) I can honestly say that I'm glad I didn't go with my gut on this one.What Hoodwinked lacks in visual prowess it makes up for in story and humor. The story keeps pace, the characters stay true to themselves, and the humor is well spaced and never goes into overkill mode. On top of that, the soundtrack is mighty fine, coloring the movie with an array of clever, catchy, and sometimes humorous songs.Now, this IS technically a kids movie, (I think kids will love it) and the kid elements are obvious, what with an extreme granny, funny talking animals, and a villain that's pretty much obvious early on in the movie.

The story has a familiar storybook start (including a clever animation of a pop-up storybook): Red, Grandma, Wolf, Woodsman - you know. Then the police show up, and anyone who remembers 1970s jargon will recognize the ""smokies"" and the ""pigs."" It's a whole new story from that point on, with a Poirot-like frog (get it? the French detective is a ""frog""?) trying to work out just what happened and why.Each character is interrogated in turn, and the story is retold from that character's standpoint. Wolf, it turns out, was an investigative reporter under cover. Woodsman was -- well, you'll see. Granny, the last to give her deposition, is worth waiting for. And I'm not going to say who did it.Despite the promising material, Hoodwinked never matches the sparkle that Shrek achieved so casually. The humor is broader and less daring, and the characters are shallower. Many references to current media and events make it sound fresh but also ensure that it will go stale fast, so see it soon if you see it at all.This one is OK as a kid's movie, but doesn't have quite enough in it to entertain the adult who paid for it.

Some are great, some I fall asleep through, and some are just simply painful. Hoodwinked was a good, and refreshing change of pace.The story of Hoodwinked is offbeat, and not a generic style that has been done a hundred times in the past 10 years. The setting is the story of Little Red Riding Hood, and the story is told in the format of a crime screne investigation. The story is retold through the eyes of the four main characters, Little Red Riding Hood, Grandmother, the Big Bad Wolf, and Paul Bunyon. Some twists are thrown in for fun: grandma loves extreme sports and fighting, the wolf is an undercover reporter, and Paul Bunyon is an actor pitching cream for your Bunyons.If you are looking for a good children's movie, you can't go wrong with Hookwinked. Even though it sounds like a movie for younger kids, it has many things that appeal to older kids as well. (extreme sports, etc.) I can'ty tell you the number of times we laughed out loud.Total Score (out of 100) = 6333 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

Hoodwinked was about the ""true"" story of Little Red Ridinghood.  To me, it seemed a lot like the premise of the Shrek movies.  It didn't start too bad, but a half hour into the 80 minute movie, I was ready to leave.  The story was used and unoriginal.  Even many of the jokes were the same jokes that I have heard in other movies.  Just after the story problems, was the animation.  I am a big fan of CGI if it is done well (Pixar), but unfortanly, CGI allows movies like this to be made that look like an older video game on a big screen.  CGI also allows bad movies like this to be pumped out on such a frequent basis that plot seems to be overlooked, and it is all about making a profit now.
