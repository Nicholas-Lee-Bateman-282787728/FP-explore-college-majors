355810,A3PR4ZSBDUL4EG,6303095151,"Matthew S. Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[63, 64]","""Broken Chain"" is a decent made-for-cable movie essentially about the difficult decisions to be made by the Six Nations of the Iroqouis during the late 18th century as white settlers expanded into the New York frontier.  It also shows the complex and fragile relationship that existed between the native tribes and their English allies as the American colonies rose up in rebellion against the crown.  Symbolizing this relationship are two Mohawks, Thayendanega (Eric Schweig), the famous Iroqouis war chief known as Joseph Brandt who allied with the British during the Revolution and led a number of daring and bloody raids along the New York and Pennsylvania frontier, and his blood brother, Lohaheo, an intelligent and conflicted leader who tries in vain to keep his people neutral in the hope that it will preserve the Confederacy of the Six Nations and save the lives and land of his people in the face of total war.After fighting against the French during the Seven Years War under the guidance of Sir William Johnson (Pierce Brosnan), an Englishman who genuinely admires the Iroquois, but who is only too eager to manipulate them for the purposes of the Crown, the Mohawks soon find themselves caught in the middle of the American Revolution, with both sides hoping to lure the powerful Confederacy to their cause.  While Lohaheo urges neutrality, Brant joins the Britsh and fights with great ferocity against the Americans at Oriskany and Wyomissing. The two must face an uncertain future for their people and struggle to save a way of life whose existence is threatened by the people with and against whom they fight.This is a good stab at a movie that brings this period of our history to life and tells a story that is too often ignored, not just the history of the Eastern Frontier, but the important role played by the Six Nations in the history of America.",4,Tale of the Six Nations and the American Revolution,1043020800,"01 20, 2003",2003,1870,"['Broken', 'Chain', 'decent', 'made-for-cable', 'movie', 'essentially', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'be', 'made', 'Six', 'Nations', 'Iroqouis', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'white', 'settlers', 'expanded', 'New', 'York', 'frontier', 'also', 'complex', 'fragile', 'relationship', 'existed', 'native', 'tribes', 'English', 'allies', 'American', 'colonies', 'rose', 'up', 'rebellion', 'crown', 'Symbolizing', 'relationship', 'are', 'two', 'Mohawks', 'Thayendanega', 'Eric', 'Schweig', 'famous', 'Iroqouis', 'war', 'chief', 'known', 'Joseph', 'Brandt', 'who', 'allied', 'British', 'Revolution', 'led', 'number', 'daring', 'bloody', 'raids', 'New', 'York', 'Pennsylvania', 'frontier', 'blood', 'brother', 'Lohaheo', 'intelligent', 'conflicted', 'leader', 'who', 'vain', 'keep', 'people', 'neutral', 'hope', 'will', 'preserve', 'Confederacy', 'Six', 'Nations', 'save', 'lives', 'land', 'people', 'face', 'total', 'war.After', 'fighting', 'French', 'Seven', 'Years', 'War', 'guidance', 'Sir', 'William', 'Johnson', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Englishman', 'who', 'genuinely', 'Iroquois', 'who', 'only', 'too', 'eager', 'manipulate', 'purposes', 'Crown', 'Mohawks', 'soon', 'find', 'caught', 'middle', 'American', 'Revolution', 'sides', 'hoping', 'lure', 'powerful', 'Confederacy', 'cause', 'Lohaheo', 'neutrality', 'Brant', 'Britsh', 'fights', 'great', 'ferocity', 'Americans', 'Oriskany', 'Wyomissing', 'two', 'must', 'face', 'uncertain', 'future', 'people', 'struggle', 'save', 'way', 'life', 'existence', 'threatened', 'people', 'whom', 'fight.This', 'good', 'stab', 'movie', 'period', 'history', 'life', 'story', 'too', 'often', 'ignored', 'not', 'just', 'history', 'Eastern', 'Frontier', 'important', 'role', 'played', 'Six', 'Nations', 'history', 'America']",The Broken Chain VHS
355811,A1XAR44IW48IEK,6303095151,Michael N. Ryan,"[4, 7]","Every group has its proverbial king David and Thayendenaga certainly lead a life that matches that of the Israilite king.He was a modest man who did rise from common ranks to become a great leader. He did have his marital problems. He certainly shared the King's problems with his own offspring. Yet he managed to rise above these things to become a great leader of his people while at the same time made himself a civilized man.Unfortunatly, this film fails to tell his story. Great costuming. Beutiful scenery and village settings. Authentic buildings. The plot was pathetic and often plodding in its work. Perhaps subject to political correctness's revisions, this film fails the man.It failed to show he was a Christian. It failed to show he was compassionate and caring. It failed to show his activities as a Freemason. It failed to show in a place of great barbarity and depravity practiced on both sides, this man refused to be part of the evils of the times. Many colonials actually owe him their lives. This man was a gentleman but this film failed to show him despite his many actions.Overall, good for visuallizing, a fair story but appears to have been partly done on the cheap.",3,David,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,1190,"['group', 'proverbial', 'king', 'David', 'Thayendenaga', 'certainly', 'lead', 'life', 'Israilite', 'king.He', 'was', 'modest', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'rise', 'common', 'ranks', 'become', 'great', 'leader', 'did', 'have', 'marital', 'problems', 'certainly', 'shared', 'King', 'problems', 'own', 'offspring', 'managed', 'rise', 'things', 'become', 'great', 'leader', 'people', 'same', 'time', 'made', 'civilized', 'man.Unfortunatly', 'film', 'tell', 'story', 'Great', 'costuming', 'Beutiful', 'scenery', 'village', 'settings', 'Authentic', 'buildings', 'plot', 'was', 'pathetic', 'often', 'plodding', 'work', 'Perhaps', 'subject', 'political', 'correctness', 'revisions', 'film', 'man.It', 'failed', 'show', 'was', 'Christian', 'failed', 'show', 'was', 'compassionate', 'caring', 'failed', 'show', 'activities', 'Freemason', 'failed', 'show', 'place', 'great', 'barbarity', 'depravity', 'practiced', 'sides', 'man', 'refused', 'be', 'part', 'evils', 'times', 'Many', 'colonials', 'actually', 'owe', 'lives', 'man', 'was', 'gentleman', 'film', 'failed', 'show', 'many', 'actions.Overall', 'good', 'visuallizing', 'fair', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'partly', 'done', 'cheap']",The Broken Chain VHS
