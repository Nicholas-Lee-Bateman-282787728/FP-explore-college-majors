Mixing elements of the psychedelic, the semi-pornographic, and the horrific, Zombie deviates from his usual formula of ""white trash"" lunatics committing random violence (which works well for his other films). The plot of LORDS develops slooowwly, mingling reality w/ nightmare imagery. Then, hell is unleashed in Salem, as a coven of witches, led by Meg Foster (THE STEPFATHER, THEY LIVE), heed their master's call. The atmosphere remains bleak and sinister throughout, while the chaos builds. In this way, it is similar to Ti West's HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. It also has a wicked, hallucinogenic quality like Dante Tomascelli's SATAN'S PLAYGROUND. Toss in some Kubrick, Argento, and a twist of Polanski, and you get the general idea. Anyone expecting HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, DEVIL'S REJECTS, etc., could be very disappointed. If, instead you have a craving for a filthy, dirty, utterly blasphemous, eeevil movie -the way devil movies are supposed to be- then this is a masterpiece!

1643555,A3FNQG7QWNP0RC,B00C7C00JU,Bob the Skull,"[1, 2]","I have actually just finished watching &#34;The Lords of Salem&#34; (TLoS) this evening.  I have been curious ever since I saw the original artwork at UHM.com, and I finally caved in tonight and payed the $3.99 rental fee.  We live and learn, right?As an avid watcher of Horror Movies; and having watched more than I can possibly count; I'd like to think that I'm fairly good at picking out what is and what isn't good in any Horror Movie.  It's not always easy; sometimes, a movie has a lot going for it and fumbles in the final moments; sometimes, what looked to be a flop turns itself around and becomes a classic.  Going into this, I thought it likely that it would be at least somewhat challenging to decide what I really thought at the end.  Some of the clips looked promising, and yet there was this inherent undertone of &#34;Witchcraft = Satanism&#34; (stars and stones, it's not as if we've seen that before), and so it looked as if my rating would be a tossup between the Horror elements winning my heart and the ridiculously cliched premise coating me with apathy ...But, it seems, Herr Zombie took pity on me and chose to make it easy: he made a terrible movie (well, at least a bad one).I suppose it's worth saying what IS good about this film prior to ripping into it; after all, what fun is it to kill a starry-eyed little productions hopes and dreams if one hasn't at least dangled the possibility of flight tantalizingly in front of it?  Some of the shots and scenes are quite effectively constructed and initially lend a great deal to the atmosphere of the film.  Several times, I was tempted to poke fun at the incredibly thick characters (oops, getting ahead of myself) only to be distracted by a clever camera angle or well chosen vista and caught myself saying, &#34;hey, that looks pretty cool.&#34;  On top of that, there are almost constantly scenes involving the nudity of a ludicrously filthy old woman that help to inspire discomfort and a certain aura of unease; but I suppose that should have been a tip-off.  After all, if the scares of your movie have to revolve around a certain character wiggling their wizened bum around on screen and moaning about Satan, you probably don't have much to go on - and how true that is here.I won't bore you with details.  Some chick is tied up - because of that fiendish assailant, genealogy - with this secret cult of devil worshiping nutters which harkens back to the days of the of the Salem Witch Trials, and she is inevitably drawn in and turned into a Satanic sex-toy.  I suppose the fact that it DOES go back to &#34;ye olde days&#34; is supposed to somehow legitimize the affair; as if this movie and &#34;Rosemary's Baby&#34; are kids in the schoolyard arguing about who got here first, and whether or not that means that they get to take the other's favorite spot.  The whole thing is quite straightforward, and if you couldn't predict where it was going from the first 5 minutes of the film then you probably enjoyed it a lot more than I did (hooray for you).  Bad music plays here; barely glimpsed dead lady is placed there; various classic (read: &#34;clearly ripped&#34;) &#34;evil&#34; or &#34;Satanic&#34; images pop up there; and Satan is played by Oswald Cobblepot.What the film (and Zombie (what kind of name is that?)) does not grasp is that what takes place just isn't scary.  Unsettling sometimes?  Yes.  Disgusting sometimes?  Yes.  But if I wanted to see loosely connected, popularized Satanic imagery and cupfuls of blood, then I could have just gone to a Gorgoroth concert and had done - no pretension there, I can promise you that.  Even the fact that characters interact fairly well fails to make up for (a) them being about as intelligent as the goats that show up from time to time (perhaps to help with contrast); and (b) the total lack of clarity in what happens.  Actually, it's that last part which gets me the most: for a film that seems determined to show as much as it can (as if we'll be scared by it thrusting scary things in our faces and shouting &#34;boo!&#34;), it seems just as determined to make sure that, in the end, you know a fat lot of nothing about what actually happens.  &#34;What? that's it?&#34; I said.  &#34;You don't even tell us what this OBVIOUSLY EVIL event accomplished?&#34;  One of the few upsides to living in the age of the Modern Horror Movie is the fact that they don't leave us hanging with those dopey &#34;or DID he die?!&#34; conclusions that just make you wonder how anyone more clever than a potato-peeler thought that would give you nightmares.  But this movie goes back to &#34;ye olde endings&#34; AND displays all of the bad habits of our generation's scary movies - like you were unfortunate enough to pick up your least favorite things at a &#34;Buy one crappy thing, get one crappy thing free&#34; sale.In short, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but fans of Rob Zombie who think that everything he does is worth owning.  If you were missing that certain special &#34;Satanic-themed&#34; something this Halloween season, just go buy Slayer's album &#34;Reign in Blood&#34; and then watch an actually good Horror

The last half hour is so bizarre that it's almost incomprehensible as Zombie employs the irrationality of nightmares to illustrate the curse's impact on Heidi.

1643560,AMYWL00JMEZXA,B00C7C00JU,bugman,"[97, 114]","went and caught a late showing of lords of salem the other night, and i was rewarded for my efforts, as I absolutely adored it. there were five other people in the theater, which kind of surprised me, and two of them left mid way through.  I think that kind of sums up how esoteric a movie it was, and I'm amazed something so specific and particular can still get made. it was disturbing, beautiful, blasphemous, and, strangely, it left me feeling kind of upbeat.the story is basically about immolated witches using what looked like a 78 rpm record in the present time to crack the doorway open for their return via the descendants of their executors.  the vehicle for their musical transmission is local salem deejay Heidi hawthorne, played by sheri moon zombie, who really does a nice job, i thought.  not perfect, but alternately energetic and morose, and always working hard.  in her alone moments, i thought she was most effective, conveying simultaneously what recovering from addiction must be like, as well as what demonic entities entering her head must be like.  she's lost, and nothing helps you get found like a coven of modern-day practicing witches. this film, less than zombie's others, is filled with more seemingly normal people, though many turn out to be not so.  i really thought  judy geeson, patricia quinn, and (especially) dee wallace were awesome as the coven of witches lurking under heidi's nose.  they worked well together, were funny and dark, and, by the end, were very much who I was rooting for.  bruce davison in full jeff bridges regalia was awesome as always, and ken foree and jeff Daniel Phillips were their usual, hardworking, effective selves.  special mention must be made of meg foster, who is sublimely uncomfortable as the crone witch leader of yore.i was sad that parts such as Barbara crampton's were excised from the film, as well as, i imagine, more of sid haig's and Michael berryman's.  i suspect, while editing, rob knew some of his vision had to be shortened and focused.  i hope the dvd will have a lot of the deleted scenes, so we can see more of lords.  but he was wise to keep this movie at around one hundred minutes.  it felt the perfect length.i'm so glad I caught lords of salem before it was driven from theaters, as it really demands a theater to be best appreciated.  brandon trost's lens is wide and sweeping at times, saturated with bright, bleeding colors, deep tones and textures.  he captures the grey that is massachusetts to perfection, and he adds weight to every interior shot in the movie..as has been talked about, there are moments that feel very kubrick-y, and others that recall roman polanski or dario argento.  ken russell's presence is also felt, and i think there's definitely some strong david lynch and david cronenberg vibes floating through this delightful movie. but make no mistake, rob is flexing his talents and artistry, and it's all his.  lords of salem is his auteur masterpiece. gone are the seemingly derivative homages, and what stands is more subtle, or more overt, or more streamlined into the movie, both in terms of the story, as well as its' visuals.  I'm not saying I mind the rest of rob's work, cus I don't, I love it, but the man is progressing.  I've heard he's gonna leave horror for a bit.  that's fine, but I hope it's only temporary.  His work is such a beautiful and courageous and ferocious amalgam of of images and ideas, it would be a shame for our genre to lose him, especially has it has been very much hordes of reactionary and angry horror fans who direct venom his way. but it is the polarizing nature of his work that contributes to what makes him an awesome and integral filmmaker, adding to his skill, his love--really, really informed and ardent love--of the genre, and his irreverence.  he provokes conversation, passion, emotion, energy, debate.  just like good art should.  I love him, and happily paid for my ticket.  I wish I could have paid more.the music is perfect and the use of the velvet underground's venus in furs and all tomorrow's parties fits it like a glove; twas good to hear in booming theater sound.  The final sequence is one of the best uses of music at the end of a movie that I have ever seen.  It's been in my head all day.  rob has shown a real evolution in his dialogue, and it was pleasant to hear conversations free of insane expletives.  cleverly, he is still able to elicit disgust in much of the dialogue, simply by being smart and describing awful things well, or benign things horribly.  the set design was fantastic, the lighting noticeably brilliant, and the outfits had an argento-esqe level of thoughtfulness and appropriateness.  i also must admit that I loved the amount of smoking in the movie (real people smoke, dammit, especially when they are stressed).  whenever tense moments in movies occur, and no one smokes, it loses credibility for me.  I also love that, in a rob zombie movie, you can count on people watching old, black and white movies in every background teevee. even the wonderful elizabeth montgomery manages to find her way into the film, which made my heart sing a bit.finally, i hafta mention how gloriously irreverent religiously it was.  it was almost gleeful in it's satanism, and really kind of poses questions like ""why do we just assume satanism is worse than and more barbaric than christianity?""  man, go satan!  it's too bad lords couldn't have gotten enuf pub or a wide enuf release to get on the radar of and start offending religious groups.  that might have brought more folks to the theater.as always, i come away from a rob zombie movie feeling strangely uplifted, and appreciative of how good life can be, how beautiful and wonderful.  this is kind of a nice effect his movies have on me, and seems antithetical to their content.  but lords of salem was no exception, and, by it's end, I was smiling ear to ear.",5,all hail the lords!,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,5909,"['went', 'caught', 'late', 'showing', 'lords', 'salem', 'other', 'night', 'i', 'was', 'rewarded', 'efforts', 'absolutely',

1643562,A2NJRBJFBTF54A,B00C7C00JU,Charles Camp,"[1, 1]","I've read another reviewer aptly describe Rob Zombie as the best horror director who has never made a great film. It's a clever description that I think has a ring of truth to it. Zombie really does have a unique, somewhat visionary approach to horror. Everything from the music he chooses to the way he cuts and splices scenes together, and even to the sequencing of the opening and closing credits has a flare that is truly his own. The trouble is that he seems to have difficulty translating that flare into a coherent and cohesive finished product.The Lords of Salem isn't the polished, fully realized film that has eluded him, but it is definitely a step in the right direction. It's a film that shows Zombie honing and refining the traits that make him a good filmmaker. He's (almost) entirely dropped the relatively corny red-neck/white-trash aesthetic that has permeated his past work in favor of a more subdued, muted, and foreboding tone. There's still that characteristic layer of grit and grime over the characters and their surroundings, but it's no longer quite as cartoonish and feels mostly grounded in reality (or at least until it jumps headfirst into the avant-garde horror wormhole).And as he dialed down that hokey characterization, he's simultaneously dialed up his visual craft. This film really looks quite stunning. It has an almost Kubrickian obsession for symmetry and slow-panning, meticulously composed wide-angled shots. It actually takes a lot of nods from The Shining as well, emphasizing tight corridor shots as well as title cards for the days of the week as the film progresses. The greatest achievement of the film is its ability to use these filming techniques to create very surreal, haunting moments and set-pieces. The lighting is absolutely fantastic as well and creates a ton of different atmospheres and textures (orange flames, yellow fog, red neon crosses, blinding spotlights, glowing stained glass etc.)As I alluded to before though, this film isn't quite the true culmination of Zombie's filmmaking gifts. It definitely suffers from some pacing issues and although his typical corniness is greatly subdued, it isn't entirely absent. There's also a little too much time devoted to a relatively uninspired, investigator/historian character that ultimately goes nowhere. And although many of surreal scenes here definitely succeed in being very haunting and visually striking, occasionally he does cross the line into frank absurdity that takes you out of the moment and stops you from completely taking it seriously.At the end of the day, Lords of Salem is definitely a Rob Zombie film through and through both in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Thankfully, Zombie has seemingly identified his strengths and successfully focuses on them enough to mostly outweigh his weaknesses. He isn't quite there yet when it comes to creating a film that is the full package, but he's definitely on the right track. I'm excited to see him further explore this abstract, artistically-minded style in future films.3.5/5",3,A step in the right direction for Rob Zombie,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,3053,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'reviewer', 'aptly', 'describe', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'best', 'horror', 'director', 'who', 'never', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'clever', 'description', 'think', 'ring', 'truth', 'Zombie', 'really', 'have', 'unique', 'somewhat', 'visionary', 'approach', 'horror', 'Everything', 'music', 'way', 'splices', 'scenes', 'together', 'even', 'sequencing', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'flare', 'truly', 'own', 'trouble', 'have', 'difficulty', 'translating', 'flare', 'coherent', 'cohesive', 'finished', 'product.The', 'Lords', 'Salem', ""n't"", 'polished', 'fully', 'realized', 'film', 'eluded', 'definitely', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'film', 'Zombie', 'honing', 'refining', 'traits', 'make', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'almost', 'entirely', 'dropped', 'relatively', 'corny', 'red-neck/white-trash', 'aesthetic', 'permeated', 'past', 'work', 'favor', 'more', 'subdued', 'muted', 'foreboding', 'tone', 'still', 'characteristic', 'layer', 'grit', 'grime', 'characters', 'surroundings', 'no', 'longer', 'quite', 'cartoonish', 'feels', 'mostly', 'grounded', 'reality', 'least', 'headfirst', 'avant-garde', 'horror', 'wormhole', '.And', 'dialed', 'down', 'hokey', 'characterization', 'simultaneously', 'dialed', 'up', 'visual', 'craft', 'film', 'really', 'quite', 'stunning', 'almost', 'Kubrickian', 'obsession', 'symmetry', 'slow-panning', 'meticulously', 'composed', 'wide-angled', 'shots', 'actually', 'lot', 'nods', 'Shining', 'as', 'well', 'emphasizing', 'tight', 'corridor', 'shots', 'as', 'well', 'title', 'cards', 'days', 'week', 'film', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'film', 'ability', 'use', 'filming', 'techniques', 'create', 'very', 'surreal', 'haunting', 'moments', 'set-pieces', 'lighting', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'well', 'ton', 'different', 'atmospheres', 'textures', 'orange', 'flames', 'yellow', 'fog', 'red', 'neon', 'crosses', 'blinding', 'spotlights', 'glowing', 'stained', 'glass', 'etc', 'alluded', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'true', 'culmination', 'Zombie', 'filmmaking', 'gifts', 'definitely', 'pacing', 'issues', 'typical', 'corniness', 'greatly', 'subdued', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'absent', 'also', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'devoted', 'relatively', 'uninspired', 'investigator/historian', 'character', 'ultimately', 'nowhere', 'many', 'surreal', 'scenes', 'here', 'definitely', 'succeed', 'being', 'very', 'haunting', 'visually', 'striking', 'occasionally', 'cross', 'line', 'frank', 'absurdity', 'moment', 'stops', 'completely', 'taking', 'end', 'day', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'definitely', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'film', 'terms', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'Thankfully', 'Zombie', 'seemingly', 'identified', 'strengths', 'successfully', 'focuses', 'enough', 'mostly', 'outweigh', 'weaknesses', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'yet', 'when', 'creating', 'film', 'full', 'package', 'definitely', 'right', 'track', ""'m"", 'excited', 'see', 'further', 'explore', 'abstract', 'artistically-minded', 'style', 'future', 'films.3.5/5']",N/A

1643564,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00C7C00JU,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[3, 3]","I'm going to try to keep this review relatively spoiler free, although I'll warn any incoming readers that I might inadvertently spoil something major. I'll try to keep to the smaller details as far as spoilers go. If you want to know whether or not to buy this, my opinion is... maybe. This isn't really like many of Zombie's other films and I can't even guarantee that you'll like it. If you're a Zombie completionist, get it to ensure that your collection is complete. If not, I recommend getting this via Netflix or similar and watching it first. Another disclaimer: I saw the theatrical version of this and not the DVD. If I watch it again on DVD, I'll update it accordingly. If it makes any difference, I'm actively debating re-watching this on DVD when it comes out, if only for the special features and director's narration. Despite how negative portions of this review might sound, there is some sort of endorsement in saying that I'd probably willingly view this again and not to make fun of it.I'll also warn you by saying that if you're expecting House of 1000 Corpses or a traditional horror film, this isn't it. This is a strange, strange film and again, very unlike anything he's done before. I wouldn't say its his best film, but I wouldn't say it's his worst either. There is some very valid merit in seeing this for yourself and you'll probably end up either loving this or hating it with a passion. There is very little inbetween with LoS, although it might take you a while to figure out which side you're on. Me? I run the gamut between absolutely loving this and hating it, hence the three stars.Now. On with the more detailed review.I'd say that my biggest complaint is that this film couldn't entirely tell what it wanted to be at times. There were some nice jump scares in the film that made this film steer towards being a more stylish horror film. Other times you have these weird, trippy scenes that made it seem like it wanted to be more of an arthouse flick. You know the type. The one that's called ""horror"" but isn't really all that scary, akin toValerie and Her Week of Wonders. If Zombie had chosen one direction or the other, this would've been a more solid film for it. As it was, the shifting from one film type to another weakened Salem's impact.The first half of this film was fairly strong, I must say. This was before it started switching back and forth between the two different film types and stayed more close to the idea of being a straight-forward horror film. You have some great scares and some fun scenes, such as the radio crew interviewing the satanic musician. I'll admit that Sheri Moon Zombie isn't the most fabulous actor, but she does the job well enough for the most part. However, when the film starts delving into trippy arthouse territory when Heidi begins losing her mind (and soul), Moon Zombie just doesn't seem to be able to really and firmly grasp the character.That isn't to say that the arthouse portion of it is without merit. There's some wonderful imagery here that unfortunately tends to look ridiculous in comparison to the more slick earlier portion. One such scene is one that will probably be the most infamous one of the film, where Heidi walks into the dreaded fifth apartment and is transported to this opulent ballroom. And is then assaulted/impregnated (sorta, but not in the way you're thinking, perv) by a double tentacled miniature demon-thing. My best friend and her husband both laughed like hyenas during this scene and I can't help but think that it was because it was so out of left field in comparison to everything up to this point. They also laughed during the ending, which sort of did the same thing. It was too ""art house"" in comparison to most of what had came before. The ending has a sort of charm and I'll admit that the image at the end of it (once you see it, you'll know what I'm referring to) is pretty cool, but it just felt a little inconsistent.There are some otherwise good performances by the side characters, who are really the most endearing ones of the film. It's interesting that Zombie chose to have so many big name actors play as secondary characters, but make them up in ways that would keep them from being immediately recognizable to the average horror/cult movie savvy fan. Patricia Quinn (Magenta from RHPS) is a rather good example of this, as she's made up *just* enough to be recognizable if you're specifically looking for her but different enough to where I had to point this out to my friends. In other words, he didn't try to make her look and sound like her more well known character of Magenta. (Anyone who has seen, say, Adrienne Barbeau in anything will know that while she's uniformly awesome in all she does, directors do sort of go out of their way to portray her as the same type of person in almost every film.) It's a bold move and one that actually pays off for Zombie because he gets the talent without anyone automatically comparing them to their more infamous roles. I've got to give him credit for this point, as this isn't what most people would really lean towards doing. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome, one of the other stronger points in the film. Another strong point is that everything was shot beautifully, even if it didn't really come together all that cohesively.The only problem is that mish-mashing of genres. It just doesn't pan out like it should and at times feels like it's more SUPER-AWESOME-MONKEY-SAUCE-RANDOMNESS than the type of off the wall randomness that you see in art house flicks that somehow works wonderfully together. It also doesn't help that I've read the book, which supposedly is the version of the movie that Zombie wanted to make, and it's a more solid story than this was, despite its own serious set of flaws. There's some great imagery here and if it had been worked together a little more rather than feeling sort of random, this could have easily been one of Zombie's greatest films. It just wasn't really there. I can't decide if I liked the film or if I hated it, so I'm giving this an ambivalent three stars. My friends? They hated it. I might watch this again once it hits DVD, just so I can hear Zombie's director's track.UPDATE:I'm in the process of trying to get my mitts on a DVD, but this film sort of grew on me over time. The more I thought about it, the more I liked it. I'll wait to change the star rating after I see the film again, but the appeal of the scenes and Zombie's various choices for the film have sort of endeared themselves to me the more this film sinks into my brain.",3,Can't quite decide what it wants to be (some spoilers),1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,6581,"[""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'keep', 'review', 'relatively', 'spoiler', 'free', ""'ll"",

I was very excited.  Lords of Salem however, turned out to be disappointing for me.  The story isn't as strong as it could be.  It's not convoluted per se but, tries to be a little bit more cryptic than it actually is.  While there is no question that Zombie and crew are capable filmmakers, Lords of Salem just falls short.  Cinematically, it has a lot of attention to detail and allure.  Although, once you have seen one camera dolly shot of a hallway at a snail's pace, you've seen them all.  Since the hallway is the conduit between Sherri Moon's apartment and her nightmares, this shot happens all too much...  The film builds and builds at a very slow pace but, never has the pay off we were looking for.  At some point things that were (I imagine) meant to be a bit alarming or creepy, came off as more comical.  The film has a much more comical view if you look at it as a character study doc about what happens to you when you turn to a life of being a juggalo... You become a very fundamentally unlikeable person to some people around you and eventually collapse.Sherri Moon Zombie did a very good job in Zombie's Halloween remake.  She wasn't the highlight of House of 1,000 Corpses but, a more tamed version in Devil's Rejects was much more tolerable.  While she is a capable actor, I think it's time we see another leading lady for a Zombie story canon.  I personally am getting a little tired of seeing her bare backside inexplicably every chance we get and Lords of Salem was not her best performance.  While the cinematography stands out here, it goes off the rails with some very strange surreal sequences that are strange because of their stylistic choice and not for their content.  At one point the film breaks out into music video territory.  The score and sound design are all great and the rest of the cast deliver some really great performances albeit some are indeed, over-the-top.Zombie paints a great picture here but sadly, the meaning of it is not as enjoyable to sit through.  I hold out high hopes for every Zombie feature that comes our way because he is an exceptionally smart and stylistic storyteller.  Lords of Salem will have to rank with the likes of Halloween II and The Haunted World of El Super Beasto for me.  If you enjoy Zombie's films, than you will find something to enjoy here.  If you feel his entries in the cinematic world have been a little spotty, then maybe pass this one up and wait for something a little more stellar to come along from old Rob.",2,Not a Lord of anything.,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,2622,"['missed', 'opportunity', 'see', 'theaters', 'so', 'immediately', 'bought', 'DVD', 'got', 'few', 'friends', 'watch', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'however', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'disappointing', 'story', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'could', 'be', 'not', 'convoluted', 'se', 'tries', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'cryptic', 'actually', 'question', 'Zombie', 'crew', 'are', 'capable', 'filmmakers', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'just', 'short', 'Cinematically', 'lot', 'attention', 'detail', 'allure', 'once', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'camera', 'dolly', 'shot', 'hallway', 'snail', 'pace', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hallway', 'conduit', 'Sherri', 'Moon', 'apartment', 'nightmares', 'shot', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'builds', 'builds', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'never', 'pay', 'were', 'looking', 'point', 'things', 'were', 'imagine', 'meant', 'be', 'bit', 'alarming', 'creepy', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'comical', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'comical', 'view', 'look', 'character', 'study', 'doc', 'what', 'when', 'turn', 'life', 'being', 'juggalo', 'become', 'very', 'fundamentally', 'unlikeable', 'person', 'people', 'eventually', 'collapse.Sherri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'remake', 'was', ""n't"", 'highlight', 'House', '1,000', 'Corpses', 'more', 'tamed', 'version', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'tolerable', 'capable', 'actor', 'think', 'time', 'see', 'leading', 'lady', 'Zombie', 'story', 'canon', 'personally', 'am', 'getting', 'little', 'tired', 'seeing', 'bare', 'backside', 'inexplicably', 'chance', 'get', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'performance', 'cinematography', 'out', 'here', 'rails', 'very', 'strange', 'surreal', 'sequences', 'are', 'strange', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'not', 'content', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'out', 'music', 'video', 'territory', 'score', 'sound', 'design', 'are', 'great', 'rest', 'cast', 'deliver', 'really', 'great', 'performances', 'are', 'indeed', 'over-the-top.Zombie', 'paints', 'great', 'picture', 'here', 'sadly', 'meaning', 'not', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'sit', 'hold', 'out', 'high', 'hopes', 'Zombie', 'feature', 'way', 'exceptionally', 'smart', 'stylistic', 'storyteller', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'will', 'have', 'rank', 'likes', 'Halloween', 'II', 'Haunted', 'World', 'El', 'Super', 'Beasto', 'enjoy', 'Zombie', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'enjoy', 'here', 'feel', 'entries', 'cinematic', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'spotty', 'then', 'maybe', 'pass', 'one', 'up', 'wait', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'stellar', 'come', 'along', 'old', 'Rob']",N/A

I am a huge fan of his music and most of his films. Check out his new cd by the way, very killer. Loved House of 1000 corpses and Devils REjects. The halloween films are so so and could really go either way. The cartoon movie was kinda interesting but Lords Of Salem was terrible.Its hard to watch the film because if you are like me, Sheri Moon is a big reason you wanted to watch the movie and it was directed by Rob Zombie. I love the fact Rob puts his wife in his work. Her first major role as the lead. I read Rob was inspired by 70's Italian style horror films and he used his own money to release the picture. Well, Im a huge fan of Old school Lucio Fulci style Italian horror and I can tell you this isnt it. I also read he used infulence from THE SHINNING, I can see it but the wrong parts of it.Here is the Pros and ConsPros+Pulls no punches+Interesting Idea (ripping of Evil Dead)+Sheri as lead+Rob Zombie as writter/directorCons-85 minutes of a 80 year old naked witch (true story)-Boring cast-Foolish ending, one of the worst ever (makes you feel like ""why did I watch this"")-Sheri looks terrible (supposed to play a crack head, I get it but oh boy was rough)-Film seems too serious for Robs Writting (the talking back and forth is a joke)The last con you will see what Im talking about when you watch the converstation back and forth about the book written about the LORDS. Rob tried to go for a serious horror film like when he tired in the Halloween films BUT thats just not for him. Rob works better with House of 1000 corpses type films. Crazy texas chainsaw type films. I read a review on IMBD where someone said this was a good as Lucio Fulci's The Beyond. You sir, are insane.**In a nut shell, I went in excited to see Rob's Idea of The Shinning, mixed with Italian old school horror, mixed with a Rob Zombie Flame but instead got my money wasted.

Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[2, 5]","Rob Zombie's ""Lords of Salem"" received very limited release (it was never released in my area), and from other reviews I have read, I really did not know what to expect.  I enjoyed Zombie's two previous movies, e.g. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and the MUCH underrated ""Devil's Rejects.""  His remake of ""Halloween"" was so-so; his ""Halloween 2"" was a little better.  But I digress; now I'm going to talk about his BEST.""Lords of Salem"" is a movie that absolutely blew me away.  From its imagery, to its use of black and white (and color), to its creepy music, LOS worked on ALL levels.  It is a simple tale about the effects--before and after--of the Salem Witch Trials where a witch curses the women of Salem and bides her time to ensure that curse is carried out.  The acting was superb:  Judy Geeson (whom I did not even recognize), Dee Wallace (of ET fame), and Meg Foster were absolutely stunning.  Bruce Davison was also very good as a professor who finds out albeit much too late why Heidi (played by Sherri Moon Zombie) is being ""courted"" by her landlady.  The scene where he unknowingly meets the ""witches,"" was so creepy and so tense that I could hardly watch it.Many people have stated they hated this movie and were extremely disappointed.  I think they thought, given the subject matter, Zombie would rev up the gore factor and it would be a balls-to-the-wall gore fest.  And I will admit even I was suprised by the lack of gore.  But Zombie allowed the story to take precedent here, just as he allowed the imagery to do his ""shocking.""  There were many parts of this film that kept me on edge because I simply did not know what to expect.  And the music...oh, that music.  I think it was maybe five simple notes, but five notes that made me want to put my hands over my ears and keep them there.I do not know what happened to keep this movie from receiving the wide release that it deserved.  Perhaps since it was more than a slice and dice film, its distributors did not think it would play well and that is very unfortunate for Zombie and anyone associated with this film.  I plan on buying it, which is something I cannot say about too many movies.  ""Lords of Salem"" is rated R for VERY disturbing images and violence.  Hats off to you, Rob Zombie.

I'll go so far as to agree he had some cool scenes if I critique them separately from the movie, but overall, I can't say I was impressed with this disjointed slop.I've read a few reviews, here and elsewhere, that think he borrowed from Kubrick. I agree to some extent, but I will say he heavily borrowed from Carpenter, in terms of sound effects and camerawork. In fact, he over did it with the Carpenter sound effects. The only part of Zombie that came through the film was Sheri Moon's horrible acting. No offense Rob.Yes, as other reviewers stated, there are scenes that will stay with you long after you've watched TLOS. For me, that scene (SPOILER ALERT) was when Moon was in the abandoned apartment down the hall, facing a neon cross while a scary, demonic Bigfoot appeared from the dark, growling. That's going to be a forever moment.If this was viewed in an art class and thought of as a series of snapshots of surreal horror, then I'd say Zombie succeeded. Italian horror director Lucio Fulci once said, ""In Italy, we tried to make films based on pure themes, without a plot, and The Beyond, like Dario Argento's Inferno, refuses conventional and traditional structures"". Maybe this is what Rob Zombie was trying to achieve. I don't know, but if you're looking for a film that makes some kind of sense, then go watch another horror movie. You're wasting your time with this one.Lastly, (subtle SPOILER ALERT) I'd like to point out to anyone who reads this and to Mr. Zombie in particular--who should take note for future projects--the best witch-burning scene in horror cinema was in ""The Devil's Rain (1975)"".

The film often has a very theatrical quality reminiscent of Argento's film with its striking lighting effects. The weak link may be Moon Zombie who is an okay actor but seems rather uninteresting and somewhat unconvincing as an actress. I watched ""The Conjuring"" just after watching this film and thought ""The Conjuring"" was a much more frightening and flawless film with consistently strong acting, but unlike ""The Conjuring"" I do feel I want to watch ""The Lords of Salem"" again simply because overall it is a more audacious and interesting film.",4,Homage to an earlier age of horror film....,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,873,"['first', 'impression', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'feel', 'were', 'number', 'things', 'missed', 'first', 'viewing', 'often', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'shadows', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'have', 'compared', 'more', 'surrealistic', 'sequences', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Suspiria', 'film', 'often', 'very', 'theatrical', 'quality', 'reminiscent', 'Argento', 'film', 'striking', 'lighting', 'effects', 'weak', 'link', 'may', 'be', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'who', 'okay', 'actor', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'somewhat', 'unconvincing', 'actress', 'watched', 'Conjuring', 'just', 'watching', 'film', 'thought', 'Conjuring', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'flawless', 'film', 'consistently', 'strong', 'acting', 'Conjuring', 'do', 'feel', 'want', 'watch', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'again', 'simply', 'overall', 'more', 'audacious', 'interesting', 'film']",N/A

1643583,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00C7C00JU,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[9, 13]","One thing about Zombie's films that comes across clearly is his love of the genre. Nowhere is that better demonstrated than in Lords. If you are a long time horror fan, especially going back to the Eurocult films of the 70s (especially the Italians) then you will appreciate it for what it was meant to be. It seems it confused the hell out of some people, which is to be expected if you have no clue about films like ""The Other Hell"" by Bruno Mattei, ""All the Colors of the Dark"" by Sergio Martino, ""Black Magic Rites"" by Renato Polselli, Moctezuma's ""The Mansion of Madness"", De Martino's ""The Antichrist"", various by the better known Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento, or Mario Bava's surreal ""Shock"" or ""Lisa and the Devil"", as well as the other entries in the ""Beyond the Door"" series, just to name a few. It helps to have seen Jean Rollin's work, as well as Jess Franco, and Paul Naschy, to be able to fully appreciate the genius of the Lords. And of course, I cannot forget Ken Russell (especially The Devils, Lair of the White Worm, and Gothic), who Rob Zombie explicitly named as an influence for this film. In other words, if you're exposure to horror is only what's come out- or remade- in the last 20 years or so, then I can see why you might be confused. This is a horror film lover's film, a demon child born of the spirit of its ancestors. Its definitely retro. Vintage Satan.There's so much going on in this film that I can't wait for it to be released on Blu Ray. My senses were overwhelmed, with so much to process on the visual and sonic levels. I loved every bit of it, by the way. Its not every day you get treated to so much bizarre, demonically inspired imagery and sound,  grotesque surrealism and hallucinatory sequences. And hardly ever in the last 20 years! In terms of acting, ""Margaret Morgan"" stole the show for me. Most of the time, Heidi was onscreen, which was fine, but man, when the original witches, especially Morgan came on, I was riveted, enthralled. The later day witches were also great, once they were revealed for who they were. Overall, the acting was just fine across the board.Thanks Rob Zombie. Lords is one of my favorite contemporary films. I will view it many times over. I can't wait to crack open the book.UPDATE: Having received the Blu Ray, I was very disappointed to find that the film is not complete. The DVD/Blu Ray release condenses the story to exclusively follow Heidi's experience. Gone are the scenes dealing with the relationship dynamics between the H Team. Gone are the scenes of how the local women respond to the subsequent playing of the title track, gone are some scenes between the author and his wife, as well as some extra footage of the death metal band. The scenes of Heidi in the room when the Jesus Saves sign was cut down, subsequent time in room 5 also cut, and her time in the baroque hall was also cut. I don't know why. Ken Foree appears in like 2 scenes in this release. I swear he actually had a role and not a cameo. I'm not sure how people who did not see the movie in theatres will experience this but I was disappointed. I am sure most who did see it in theatres will feel cheated. Why did this happen, especially to a movie that had a limited theatrical run? That means most people will not have seen the movie as it was intended to be seen.",5,"Great Film, Cut Blu Ray",1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,3325,"['One', 'thing', 'Zombie', 'films', 'clearly', 'love', 'genre', 'Nowhere', 'better', 'demonstrated', 'Lords', 'are', 'long', 'time', 'horror', 'fan', 'especially', 'going', 'back', 'Eurocult', 'films', '70s', 'especially', 'Italians', 'then', 'will', 'appreciate', 'what', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'confused', 'hell', 'people', 'be', 'expected', 'have', 'clue', 'films', 'Other', 'Hell', 'Bruno', 'Mattei', 'Colors', 'Dark', 'Sergio', 'Martino', 'Black', 'Magic', 'Rites', 'Renato', 'Polselli', 'Moctezuma', 'Mansion', 'Madness', 'De', 'Martino', 'Antichrist', 'various', 'better', 'known', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Mario', 'Bava', 'surreal', 'Shock', 'Lisa', 'Devil', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'entries', 'Beyond', 'Door', 'series', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'have', 'seen', 'Jean', 'Rollin', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Jess', 'Franco', 'Paul', 'Naschy', 'be', 'able', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'genius', 'Lords', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'especially', 'Devils', 'Lair', 'White', 'Worm', 'Gothic', 'who', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'explicitly', 'named', 'influence', 'film', 'other', 'words', ""'re"", 'exposure', 'horror', 'only', 'what', 'come', 'out-', 'remade-', 'last', '20', 'years', 'so', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'might', 'be', 'confused', 'horror', 'film', 'lover', 'film', 'demon', 'child', 'born', 'spirit', 'ancestors', 'definitely', 'retro', 'Vintage', 'Satan.There', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'released', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'senses', 'were', 'overwhelmed', 'so', 'much', 'process', 'visual', 'sonic', 'levels', 'loved', 'bit', 'way', 'not', 'day', 'get', 'treated', 'so', 'much', 'bizarre', 'demonically', 'inspired', 'imagery', 'sound', 'grotesque', 'surrealism', 'hallucinatory', 'sequences', 'hardly', 'ever', 'last', '20', 'years', 'terms', 'acting', 'Margaret', 'Morgan', 'stole', 'show', 'Most', 'time', 'Heidi', 'was', 'onscreen', 'was', 'fine', 'man', 'when', 'original', 'witches', 'especially', 'Morgan', 'came', 'was', 'riveted', 'enthralled', 'later', 'day', 'witches', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'once', 'were', 'revealed', 'who', 'were', 'Overall', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'board.Thanks', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Lords', 'one', 'favorite', 'contemporary', 'films', 'will', 'view', 'many', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'crack', 'open', 'book.UPDATE', 'Having', 'received', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'find', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'DVD/Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'story', 'exclusively', 'follow', 'Heidi', 'experience', 'Gone', 'are', 'scenes', 'dealing', 'relationship', 'dynamics', 'H', 'Team', 'Gone', 'are', 'scenes', 'how', 'local', 'women', 'respond', 'subsequent', 'playing', 'title', 'track', 'gone', 'are', 'scenes', 'author', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'extra', 'footage', 'death', 'metal', 'band', 'scenes', 'Heidi', 'room', 'when', 'Jesus', 'Saves', 'sign', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'subsequent', 'time', 'room', '5', 'also', 'cut', 'time', 'baroque', 'hall', 'was', 'also', 'cut', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Ken', 'Foree', '2', 'scenes', 'release', 'swear', 'actually', 'had', 'role', 'not', 'cameo', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'theatres', 'will', 'experience', 'was', 'disappointed', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'who', 'did', 'see', 'theatres', 'will', 'feel', 'cheated', 'Why', 'did', 'happen', 'especially', 'movie', 'had', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'run', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

1643585,A3PWNITZ4K14T6,B00C7C00JU,Evan J. Peterson,"[3, 3]","I'm here to defend this film. I will agree with many reviewers that not much happens until Act 3, then it gets flat-out surreal. But why are people so hung up on that? This may be Rob Zombie's most artistic film yet. It does become basically a Zombie music video by the end, but guess what? I LIKE THAT.Is there a plot? Only a thin one. Do I care? No. Zombie is trying some new techniques. The camp and splash are still there for sure, but he has some understated, quietly building horror as well. By the end, he's clearly inspired by Kubrick, pairing classical music with hugely spacious, opulent sets in which the characters are intimidated to the point of cosmic despair.Is Sherie Moon Zombie an adequate actress? She doesn't need to be. Her lines aren't great, nor does she have many of them, but she holds her own. She's not there to be breasty or stark-raving mad. She's not Harley Quinn, which is basically who she played in House of 1000 Corpses. This is, believe it or not, Mr. and Mrs. Zombie's &#34;quiet&#34; horror film (again, the Kubrick inspiration).As far as casting, Zombie outdoes himself by going beyond the genre-savvy stunt casting of his previous films and getting better genre actors. Dee Wallace (the mom from E.T. and Critters, the lead in The Howling) and Patricia Quinn (Magenta from the Rocky Horror Picture Show) are phenomenally good in their supporting roles as motherly witches and do the most with their lines. Are they good witches or bad witches? You'll have to watch to find out. Meg Foster and Bruce Davison also give strong performances, though Ken Foree's presence in the film is wasted.In the director commentary, we learn how many challenges Zombie had in making this film. I wonder how much better it could've been if he'd been able to retain little nuances like the scenes of Sid Haig and Michael Berryman, or &#34;Frankenstein vs. the Witchhunter,&#34; a film-within-the-film a la &#34;Werewolf Women of the SS.&#34;",4,Horror as Art.

I watched most of what has come out in the horror genre over the past 20 years from big budget to low, low budget.  Never have I seen anything to compare to this large steaming pile of manure.  Even Rob Zombie should be able to do better than this.  It's boring and stupid.  The acting is horrendous.  The main actress must be Rob's daughter.(I have since been informed by numerous Zombie fans that this is actually Rob's wife.  I stand corrected but I think it's obvious why I'd think daughter if you have ever seen the two of them together)  Watching her is like watching a mannequin try to act.  There simply are no redeeming qualities to this thing.  I got through about half of it and ended up fast forwarding thru most of the second half just to see what happens at the end in hopes that there would be some payoff for the torture you are subjected to for the rest of the movie.  Nope, just more torture.  Please don't waste your money or time on this.  If you feel that you must, wait a week or two and get a copy from the discount bin at the used video store.

It does not begin to approach his best work. The Devil's Rejects and both Halloween remakes are light years ahead of Lords in nearly every important critical aspect. THE PLOT? It's feels completely derivative. In the vein of other better and more respected films like Rosemary's Baby, Servants of the Twilight, The Wicker Man, the Skeleton Key and the Omen, this script simply never builds any meaningful momentum. THE DIALOGUE? Unimpressive to say the least. The writing wasn't clever or inventive and was not elevated by the WOODEN ACTING that accompanied it. Zombie forgoes genuine scares and brooding tension in favor of  visual gimmicks centered around arcane symbolism and blasphemous imagery. When used properly these would normally be an acceptable means to achieve an absorbing, atmospheric film, especially for this subject matter. However, despite copious amounts of nudity, blood, profanity, weird lighting techniques and an occult themed heavy metal soundtrack, the movie felt dull and uninvolving. Seriously, there are some TV shows that capture the look and feel of this genre much more convincingly than Lords of Salem does.

It starts out nice and you can tell there is going to be a slow build but it builds up to exactly what you thought it was going to build up to. No huge plot twist or anything.

She is anonymously sent a box containing a record inscribed ""the Lords.""Heidi plays ""the Lords' greatest hits"" on the air--which sounds like playing a death metal band's record backwards--and women across Salem become possessed instantly over the air ways.  Francis Matthias (Bruce Davison), an author, witchcraft historian and guest on Heidi's show chatting about the Salem witch trials and how witchcraft is a psychotic practice, is a little apprehensive about the Lords' song.  Francis tasks himself with investigating the ""Lords of Salem,""Written and directed by Rob Zombie (Halloween 1 & 2, House of 1000 Corpses), this movie aims for gravity and an artistic journey into Heidi's possession and why she was chosen.  One device which Zombie uses differently than most masters of horror is nudity.  We see a lot of nudity, but often not on women you'd find ""sexy"" as they are occasionally older, heavy and/or filthy, nearly corpse-like in some cases.  Neither one of Zombie's typical gore fests nor a cookie cutter teeny bopper horror film in which brutal death is prescribed by premarital sex or underage drinking, Zombie set out to really make a film.  Great lengths were gone to capture powerful shots, eerie transitions and haunting lighting.  At times Zombie's attempts to be dark and artistic were overdone by a hand not yet sufficiently practiced behind the camera.  But I appreciate what he tried to do and his less elaborate attempts (generally in the first and second acts) felt effective.You can't get too critical over this film.  You need to let go and take the ""trip,"" because increasingly psychedelic is exactly what is produced before your eyes and ears.  I feel that Zombie clearly had difficulty tying together an adequate ending from an otherwise very effective serious of weird events.  Even though I had no clue where these events were leading me--and, evidently Zombie didn't really know either--they had my attention and interest, making the ending all the more abruptly disappointing.  At least the ending really only takes about 10 minutes.If you know Rob Zombie's work, then you know that pretty much everything stars his wife and shows her fun parts.  Neither of these are bad things.  I've been generally please with Sheri's acting and...her ummmm...you know.  But one thing I love about Rob Zombie beyond his vision for horror is how he loves to cast horror icons.  We get horror cameos galore, over 20 in fact, including Heidi's cohosts Herman 'Whitey' Salvador (Jeff Daniel Phillips; Zodiac, Halloween II) and Herman Jackson (Ken Foree; Halloween, Death Spa, Dawn of the Dead), along with Dee Wallace (The Howling, Cujo, Critters), Meg Foster (They Live, Leviathan, Masters of the Universe), Nancy Linehan Charles (Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Stepfater), Bonita Friedericy (Paranormal Activity 3), Andrew Prine (Witchouse II: Blood Coven, V: The Final Battle, Amityville II: The Possession), Richard Fancy (Species, Spellbinder), Michael Berryman (Weird Science, The Hills Have Eyes Parts I & II), Judy Geeson (Inseminoid), Sid Haig (Galaxy of Terror, Creature), Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator, You're Next, Puppetmaster), Clint Howard (Halloween, House of the Dead), Udo Kier (The Theater Bizarre, Mother of Tears, Iron Sky), Camille Keaton (I Spit on Your Grave, The Butterfly Room), Richard Lynch (The Sword and the Sorcerer, Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge), Silvia Moore (Chillerama), Maria Olsen (Paranormal Activity 3), Michael Shamus Wiles  (Hellraiser: Inferno, The Puppet Masters, Puppet Master 4), Lisa Marie (Sleepy HollowMars Attacks!), Maria Conchita Alonso (Predator 2, The Running Man) and Daniel Roebuck (John Dies at the End, Final Destination).I am generally pleased with Zombie's body of work and this represents an important step for him.

I get that Rob Zombie is different, he's dark, he's sick, he's depraved and twisted, but he is also a Director, so that type of hype only gets you so far before you are expected to prove to people you are talented at Directing ""good"" films.First of all, The House of a 1000 Corpses was Rob Zombie's first movie and even though it wasn't perfect I still gave him the benefit of the doubt just because it was his first. Despite it being clear that he was ripping off the Texas Chainsaw Massacre trying to put his own little spin on it. Plus, the acting was horrendous.After that, he moved on to The Devil's Rejects which was supposed to be the sequel to the first movie, but way better. It was better, and I liked it even though I knew it wasn't going to win any awards. Plus, the acting was still bad.Then he goes on to show us his vision with the Halloween movies. This is when I was certain that he had finally ""arrived"" so to speak. I loved... loved... loved what he did with Halloween. He had finally won me over. The acting was great!Alas, we have the Lords of Salem which I couldn't wait to see, so I thought I was in for a real treat. I was wrong! The problem is that he tries to go for shock value, and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't, and this didn't work at all. Even if you put aside the fact that his premise about the Salem witches returning for revenge is a plot that has either been made reference to many times before, and is just another vastly overused plot at this point in time. What about women being forced to carry and bare Satan's spawn? I can think of several movies off the top of my head right now that is about the exact same thing. What about the empty rooms with no tenants even though the lead character swears they've either heard, or saw, someone in the vacant apartment? Does any of that sound familiar? It should.With that said, where's the shocker? There is nothing new about any of this, so I fail to see what others find so impressive. I get that he tried to create a creepy atmosphere, but the Sasquatch...really! Are you kidding me? That's the best he could come up with. The only thing this movie did have going for itself was Sherri Moon Zombie, although, she looked like she needed a shower the entire movie. I think she has really blossomed as an actress though, and she shouldn't just confine herself to only starring in her husband's film's.

""The cat conquerors""","[2, 4]","The Lords of NothingA woman, who is a radio DJ and also the descendant of a man who executed suspected Witches during the time of the Salem Witch Trials in Salem, MA......encounters some strange occurrences and things further develop from there.Heidi (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a DJ at a local Radio Station in Salem, MA.  The movie starts off ordinarily enough, introducing you to Heidi's daily life as well as Heidi's co- worker's and landlord, etc.  However not long into the movie, Heidi receives a mysterious box containing a record from a little known band known as ""The Lords"".  The record is then played on the air during Heidi's radio show.  There is not much actual music, rather mostly weird distortions and nonsensical vocals that seem to have no point whatsoever.  However the sounds do have a very profound effect on Heidi.  As the movie further progresses, Heidi (a former drug addict) has a relapse and things seem to fall apart.  There are further weird and unexplained occurrences involving Heidi, a guest who appeared on one of Heidi's broadcasts, as well as Heidi's landlord and her Landlord's two sisters who just `happen' to be visiting from out of town just when things are starting to really get strange.That's about all I can really say about the plot or movie without really giving too much away, however the sad truth is - there is not really much at all TO give away about the movie!I had considered for a while buying this movie on Blu Ray brand new, even at a regular retail price if I had to - because it was a Rob Zombie movie and I have loved what I have seen him put out....UNTIL NOW.I was very glad that I did not actually buy this movie, and that I instead rented the movie on PPV.  The movie had no real point or plot to it so far.  No real attempt at any kind of special effects or even just cheap makeup done correctly!  The movie was not scary, nor entertaining in any way, shape or form.  There was no point whatsoever to this movie. No structure, no explanations, just one confusing scene after the next with no point whatsoever in the vast majority of scenes in the film.Did Rob Zombie intentionally make a bad film as a way to get out of a contract with a film studio?  Even so, how a man such as Rob Zombie with such incredible talent and potential could put out such a poor quality product is very puzzling indeed.Most horror films are not very good, however there are usually at least some good moments in the film or some great special effects and so on......this film had neither of those nor anything with any redeeming entertainment value whatsoever.I don't want to get too specific for those who have not seen the film.....but there is one sequence where Heidi has an encounter with what is supposed to be something non human......That sequence, scene....whatever you call it was so bad I really struggled to force myself to watch the rest of the movie.  I debated for a moment even calling my Cable Company and demanding a refund on the PPV charge for the movie.I was very disappointed to see such a scene from a film involving Rob Zombie, who is someone I still have a lot of respect for - though I will be very skeptical of his next movie.  I hope Rob Zombie wakes up and gets back to making great horror films again, as there are not very many directors out there anymore who are even capable of making a great horror movie.If you must see this movie for yourself, fine....I had to see it too despite the bad reviews I had read......however do not buy this movie!  Rent the movie if you must see it, or better yet watch it for free if you get a movie channel or whatever that happens to be showing it, etc ,etc, etc.Take a look on imdb to see just how many people were involved in the making of this film.  If this had been a small film made by Rob Zombie's friends and family....I could understand and I would be more forgiving about how bad this movie turned out to be.  However this was actually a much bigger production than a lot of other Horror movies which are far better usually have......there is no reason whatsoever this film should have turned out as poorly as it unfortunately did.Of course with a filming budget listed as only 1.5 million......that does explain a lot - but for that amount of money there is still no excuse for the movie to have been as bad as it was.  The movie focused on things it could in no way achieve with such a small budget and in turn was horrible beyond belief.  Instead of reaching so high, they should have had a much better script and focused more on the actors and actresses involved and then the film may have been amazing.Whatever you do, do not buy this movie...rent it!  Or just skip it altogether......",1,THE LORDS OF NOTHING,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,4705,"['Lords', 'NothingA', 'woman', 'who', 'radio', 'DJ', 'also', 'descendant', 'man', 'who', 'executed',

1643633,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00C7C00JU,Mark Turner,"[2, 2]","If you know me at all you know that I am a horror fan. I've written about enough horror films and talked about how much I enjoy the good ones but take to task the bad ones for being just that, bad movies. Of course the horror genre has also had its share of so bad its good films too, but for the most part bad is just bad. This week's release THE LORDS OF SALEM doesn't fall into that category but for me it didn't reach the status of classic either.The story revolves around Heidi Hawthorne (Sheri Moon Zombie), a local DJ who with partners Herman ""Whitey"" Salvadore (Jeff Daniel Phillips) and Herman Jackson (Ken Foree) have the hottest show going in Salem, Massachusetts. A combination shock jock, funny folk and music playing trio they're on late night and garner great ratings. One night as they're leaving the station Heidi is told she has a package, an oddly made box that contains an album in it by someone calling themselves The Lords.Heading home with Whitey the friends have dinner and get stoned then put the album on. Immediately Heidi begins to go into a trance and have strange visions while Whitey experiences nothing. From that day forward Heidi continues to experience odd things, especially while dreaming. Most of the dreams center on the room at the end of the hall in the house her apartment is in. The landlady, Lacy Doyle (Judy Geeson) tells her no one rents that room but the dreams make her believe otherwise.The next night they have a guest on the show, an author named Francis Matthias (Bruce Davison) who has written a book on the witches. As his piece on the show ends, they play the album on the radio station and it begins to affect women all over Salem. Could this somehow tie in to the witches seen during the films opening sequence where they were attempting to bring for Satan?Matthias, hearing Herman call the group the Lords of Salem begins to worry. He's read that name somewhere in his research. Digging deeper he continues to seek answers to his questions, eventually going to Heidi's apartment only to find her gone but Mrs. Doyle and her two sisters Megan (Patricia Quinn) and Sonny (Dee Wallace) there. How they tie in becomes apparent early on but just what happens before the end of the film is a bit disturbing.On the good side I will say that this is a brilliant looking film. It seems as if no budget was spared in making it and several shots in the film are magnificent to behold. They're like nothing seen in a horror film lately, at times reminding me of THE SHINING. I'll give director Rob Zombie credit on this issue mainly because I was afraid after his last several films that he'd turn into a one note director with a penchant for showing slummy looking houses and people in every film. Here he clearly steers away from that and comes up with a visually appealing film with images that may stick with you. Another great thing is the acting with all involved turning in solid performances. Horror stalwarts like Ken Foree (a great guy if you ever get the chance to meet him), Michael Berryman and Andrew Prine all get screen time that they deserve more of.It's those images that are the most disturbing. Don't go in expecting a slice and dice killer flick or a monster of the week here. The movie deals with the issues of satanic rituals and witches that are involved in dark arts. Most sequences involving the witches have them completely nude and covered in something vile. While I was at first angered by the amount of negativity in the movie that seemed desperate to cling to the edgy rock and roll attitude of Satan spewing head bangers I slowly realized that the movie went no deeper into that area of story than ROSEMARY'S BABY did 45 years ago. If that movie bothered you than this one will take you over the top.Zombie uses slow pacing to his advantage here, allowing the story to unfold rather than be rushed. It gives him time to play out the images that he's chosen, disturbing though they might be to most people. Each and every actor here turns in a believable performance in this unusual setting.I can't honestly say that I loved or hated this movie. It will take a second viewing to decide. Horror fans will flock to this film for the name recognition of Zombie alone. Some will watch it out of curiosity. For those willing to take a look keep in mind what you're getting into and know up front that the more tame viewers will be shaken up.",3,DISTURBING HORROR,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,4413,"['know', 'know', 'am', 'horror', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'written', 'enough', 'horror', 'films', 'talked', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'good', 'ones', 'take', 'task', 'bad', 'ones', 'being', 'just', 'bad', 'movies', 'course', 'horror', 'genre', 'also', 'had', 'share', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'films', 'too', 'most', 'part', 'bad', 'just', 'bad', 'week', 'release', 'THE', 'LORDS', 'OF', 'SALEM', ""n't"", 'fall', 'category', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'status', 'classic', 'either.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Heidi', 'Hawthorne', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'local', 'DJ', 'who', 'partners', 'Herman', 'Whitey', 'Salvadore', 'Jeff', 'Daniel', 'Phillips', 'Herman', 'Jackson', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'have', 'hottest', 'show', 'going', 'Salem', 'Massachusetts', 'combination', 'shock', 'jock', 'funny', 'folk', 'music', 'playing', 'trio', ""'re"", 'late', 'night', 'garner', 'great', 'ratings', 'One', 'night', ""'re"", 'leaving', 'station', 'Heidi', 'told', 'package', 'oddly', 'made', 'box', 'album', 'someone', 'calling', 'Lords.Heading', 'home', 'Whitey', 'friends', 'have', 'dinner', 'get', 'stoned', 'then', 'put', 'album', 'Immediately', 'Heidi', 'go', 'trance', 'have', 'strange', 'visions', 'Whitey', 'nothing', 'day', 'forward', 'Heidi', 'experience', 'odd', 'things', 'especially', 'dreaming', 'Most', 'dreams', 'center', 'room', 'end', 'hall', 'house', 'apartment', 'landlady', 'Lacy', 'Doyle', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'one', 'room', 'dreams', 'make', 'believe', 'otherwise.The', 'next', 'night', 'have', 'guest', 'show', 'author', 'named', 'Francis', 'Matthias', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'who', 'written', 'book', 'witches', 'piece', 'show', 'play', 'album', 'radio', 'station', 'affect', 'women', 'Salem', 'Could', 'somehow', 'witches', 'seen', 'films', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'were', 'attempting', 'bring', 'Satan', 'Matthias', 'hearing', 'Herman', 'call', 'group', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'worry', 'read', 'name', 'somewhere', 'research', 'Digging', 'seek', 'answers', 'questions', 'eventually', 'going', 'Heidi', 'apartment', 'only', 'find', 'gone', 'Mrs.', 'Doyle', 'two', 'sisters', 'Megan', 'Patricia', 'Quinn', 'Sonny', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'there', 'How', 'tie', 'becomes', 'apparent', 'early', 'just', 'what', 'end', 'film', 'bit', 'good', 'side', 'will', 'say', 'brilliant', 'looking', 'film', 'budget', 'was', 'spared', 'making', 'several', 'shots', 'film', 'are', 'magnificent', 'behold', ""'re"", 'nothing', 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'lately', 'times', 'reminding', 'THE', 'SHINING', ""'ll"", 'give', 'director', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'credit', 'issue', 'mainly', 'was', 'afraid', 'last', 'several', 'films', ""'d"", 'turn', 'one', 'note', 'director', 'penchant', 'showing', 'slummy', 'looking', 'houses', 'people', 'film', 'Here', 'clearly', 'away', 'up', 'visually', 'appealing', 'film', 'images', 'may', 'stick', 'great', 'thing', 'acting', 'involved', 'turning', 'solid', 'performances', 'Horror', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'great', 'guy', 'ever', 'get', 'chance', 'meet', 'Michael', 'Berryman', 'Andrew', 'Prine', 'get', 'screen', 'time', 'deserve', 'more', 'of.It', 'images', 'are', 'most', 'disturbing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'slice', 'dice', 'killer', 'flick', 'monster', 'week', 'here', 'movie', 'deals', 'issues', 'satanic', 'rituals', 'witches', 'are', 'involved', 'dark', 'arts', 'Most', 'sequences', 'involving', 'witches', 'have', 'completely', 'nude', 'covered', 'something', 'vile', 'was', 'first', 'angered', 'amount', 'negativity', 'movie', 'seemed', 'desperate', 'cling', 'edgy', 'rock', 'roll', 'attitude', 'Satan', 'spewing', 'head', 'bangers', 'slowly', 'realized', 'movie', 'went', 'deeper', 'area', 'story', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'did', '45', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'bothered', 'one', 'will', 'take', 'top.Zombie', 'uses', 'slow', 'pacing', 'advantage', 'here', 'allowing', 'story', 'unfold', 'rather', 'be', 'rushed', 'time', 'play', 'out', 'images', 'chosen', 'disturbing', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'people', 'actor', 'here', 'believable', 'performance', 'unusual', 'setting.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'loved', 'hated', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'second', 'viewing', 'decide', 'Horror', 'fans', 'will', 'flock', 'film', 'name', 'recognition', 'Zombie', 'alone', 'will', 'watch', 'curiosity', 'willing', 'take', 'look', 'keep', 'mind', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'know', 'up', 'front', 'more', 'tame', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'shaken', 'up']",N/A

1643635,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00C7C00JU,Matthew Scott Baker,"[2, 3]","Rob Zombie has long been a name synonymous with horror, and for very good reason.  Any horror fan worth their weight in blood knows that Zombie has given us some terrifying modern-day classics.  His latest film, THE LORDS OF SALEM, takes us on a bit of a different ride, although the central horror elements are still present.  And while this film is a change from what we are used to seeing from this master of horror, it is still vastly entertaining and worth checking out.I can't tell you just how much I was looking forward to this film.  Rob Zombie has been one of my favorite horror directors for a decade now, ever since I caught HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES back in 2003.  I knew then that Zombie was destined for horror greatness.THE LORDS OF SALEM is not what I was expecting, but it is an excellent movie nonetheless.  I've read some reviews that didn't like it, saying it was way too artistic and not scary enough.  I disagree; Rob Zombie brings horror to a new level with this film, blending a skillful concoction of art with horror, much like Argento's SUSPIRIA or Kubrick's THE SHINING.This film is shot well and the acting is superb.  I continue to be impressed with Sheri Moon Zombie and her acting ability; I hope to see more of her in the future.  Meg Foster, Dee Wallace, Judy Geeson, and Patricia Quinn give amazing performances as well, which greatly accents the terrifying situation Moon Zombie's character finds herself in.The storyline in THE LORDS OF SALEM is what truly wins me over.  The plot is a thick combination of urban lore and history, which does nothing but lend credibility to the movie's gothic overtones.  I do not want to say anymore, because I do not want to ruin anything; this is simply a movie that you must see to appreciate.THE LORDS OF SALEM is a definite win for me and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Fans who already enjoy Rob Zombie's work should be impressed, and newcomers will definitely want to check out more of his films after seeing this one.  Be sure and watch it on Blu-ray, as the HD picture and sound quality are tough to beat.  The film is available now.",5,Excellent artistic horror from a true horror master,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,2116,"['Rob', 'Zombie', 'long', 'been', 'name', 'synonymous', 'horror', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'horror', 'fan', 'weight', 'blood', 'knows', 'Zombie', 'given', 'terrifying', 'modern-day', 'classics', 'latest', 'film', 'LORDS', 'OF', 'SALEM', 'bit', 'different', 'ride', 'central', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'still', 'present', 'film', 'change', 'what', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'master', 'horror', 'still', 'vastly', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'directors', 'decade', 'now', 'ever', 'caught', 'HOUSE', '1000', 'CORPSES', 'back', '2003', 'knew', 'then', 'Zombie', 'was', 'destined', 'horror', 'greatness.THE', 'LORDS', 'OF', 'SALEM', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'excellent', 'movie', 'nonetheless', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'saying', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'artistic', 'not', 'scary', 'enough', 'disagree', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'horror', 'new', 'level', 'film', 'blending', 'skillful', 'concoction', 'art', 'horror', 'much', 'Argento', 'SUSPIRIA', 'Kubrick', 'THE', 'SHINING.This', 'film', 'shot', 'well', 'acting', 'superb', 'continue', 'be', 'impressed', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'acting', 'ability', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'future', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'Patricia', 'Quinn', 'give', 'amazing', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'greatly', 'terrifying', 'situation', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'character', 'in.The', 'storyline', 'THE', 'LORDS', 'OF', 'SALEM', 'what', 'truly', 'plot', 'thick', 'combination', 'urban', 'lore', 'history', 'nothing', 'lend', 'credibility', 'movie', 'gothic', 'overtones', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'say', 'anymore', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'ruin', 'anything', 'simply', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'appreciate.THE', 'LORDS', 'OF', 'SALEM', 'definite', 'win', 'highly', 'recommend', 'giving', 'look', 'Fans', 'who', 'already', 'enjoy', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'impressed', 'newcomers', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'more', 'films', 'seeing', 'one', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'Blu-ray', 'HD', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'tough', 'beat', 'film', 'available', 'now']",N/A

The basic premise is that the witches burned at the stake condemned their descendents with a curse. The film gets going when a DJ from the local metal radio station receives a record that starts to affect her when she listens to it.It's not a terrible horror film, but it is pretty mediocre. It has a few interesting moments, but not enough to lift it from what is standard cheap horror tricks. It relies too much on shock and surprise rather than building tension. It does build a bit of suspense, but then ruins it with another shock moment.One aspect it does do reasonably well is the audio element. The music themes work well (although if you're not a fan of metal it could get a bit much), but again it's geared to towards shock and awe rather than layering an atmosphere.Some of the effects are ropey (literally in one case) as well.

1643637,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00C7C00JU,Micheal Hunt,"[7, 16]","Lords of Salem is the latest Rob Zombie flick, and he wants this movie to be so old school, that he even threw in the most useless ideas to make a bad C-grade film. Why a movie needs to start off with Sherri Moon Zombie naked on a bed, waking up and having a pee is anyones guess? But it pretty much sets the mood up for the rest of the movie; the mood of, this is going to be a bad movie. Not bad as in tough, cool, or great, no, bad as in, horribly made, bad plots and a bunch of useless shots.When I first saw the trailer, I rolled my eyes and thought Rob Zombie has really dropped the ball, and I had no intention of even watching it. However, a popular review panel online said that they had not liked any of Rob Zombies previous films, apart from Devil's Rejects. And that is my opinion too. So I figured, maybe we think alike? But no, they said this movie was not great, but it was good. Not to me it wasn't, I was bored from start to finish. If I wasn't raising an eyebrow at what the hell was being shown, I was stapling my eye lids open so I don't go to sleep too early and ruin by patterns.So, from what very little to understand plot there is; a bunch of witches where burned alive 100 years ago. They cursed the bloodlines of the one who burned them, and, now Sherri Moon Zombie's character... err... blondie girl is caught up in it when she receives a weird record to play at her radio station where she broadcasts her late night show from.Too much of it evolves around nothing, then something weird happening, and it's a dream or hallucination or something, and then no explanation as to why something just happened, just a mind messing effect put in for no reason, followed by another useless scene that has nothing to do with anything. Rob may have caught that 70's horror movie feel, but there is a reason a lot of people moved on from them now. They are pointless and boring. The end of the film is what I expected, a confusing joke to just finish a movie off.If you also thought to check this movie out because you heard it was blasphemous, HAHA, don't bother. It won't give you any kicks in anything you haven't seen or heard before. There is only one memorable scene in this whole movie, and it's within the first 10mins. So if you get that far and think the movie is going nowhere, take my word on it, you don't have to force yourself to watch it hoping it gets better, because it doesn't.I don't think I will bother watching anymore Rob Zombie films.

1643639,A3V7QE1Z18U349,B00C7C00JU,Miranda Thomason,"[6, 6]","In the beginning, there is the mysterious apartment 5 at the end of the hall in an apartment complex where the local rock DJ lives. Sherri Moon Zombie plays this character to the bone.  Then she gets a record dropped off at the radio station. She plays the record on air while an author who wrote a book about witches is the on air guest. Spoiler Alert. I was onboard at this point but the train derailed. The film had an old school 1970's supernatural movie feel. It wasn't supposed to be gory just that creepy the witches/devil are out there plotting something. Things took a bad turn when the screen flashed with some Scooby Doo psychedelic stuff promoting the radio show the main character worked on. Then the scene with the witches being burned. Everyone knows a witch has never been burned in Salem or the US. Burning witches was a European thing. The Salem witches were hanged. Salem is as close to Halloween Town in the Nightmare Before Christmas as any place in the US. The Bewitched statue was shown but that was about all the viewer got to see of Salem. It was definitely shot on location. The old buildings are there. There is an old graveyard in Salem where the crypts are practically crumbling with weird skeleton angels on the graves. That could have made a great scene. When Rob Zombie stays closer to reality or at least something that could happen it is gold. Devil's Rejections, that could really happen and that is why it is so scary. Dealing with witches and devils cannot go off into campy or it is not scary. Did Hocus Pocus scare anyone? The scenes which some reviewers thought were art do not work in a horror film. I think it was Halloween 2 where Michael Myers and his mother are in a field and are dancing around as if they are on a LSD trip, it did not work. The author investigating the witches could have been played up more. The witches were not scary. Three old broads drinking down some tea every five seconds reminded me of Murder She Wrote. The opening scene witches who came back throughout the movie where kinda scary. The scene with the devils touching themselves was beyond lame. The lobster baby that the DJ gives birth to looked like they got it out of the tank at Red Lobster. The fat devil child had no connection to the movie and was super cartoony. Near the end, the movie melted down into a crazy bunch of images that just did not fit and did not help the story. The end was pretty good as it was mixed in with the credits. It was the old newscaster voice summing things up. Because in the last 20 seconds the viewer gets that, the music is being played for the descendants of the Judge and the townspeople who killed the witches. Until that point, it was only clear the descendant of the Judge was to bear the lobster baby. The other women being brought to slaughter could have been move of the movie. The Judge and the townspeople who were in on the hangings are buried in a cemetery in the middle of Salem with these creepy old trees. That could have been used. The location was just about wasted and this film went off the rails of the crazy train but not in a fun ride kind of way.",3,It wasn't scary Spoiler Alert,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,3133,"['beginning', 'mysterious', 'apartment', '5', 'end', 'hall', 'apartment', 'complex', 'where', 'local', 'rock', 'DJ', 'Sherri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'character', 'bone', 'Then', 'record', 'dropped', 'off', 'radio', 'station', 'record', 'air', 'author', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'witches', 'air', 'guest', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'was', 'onboard', 'point', 'train', 'derailed', 'film', 'had', 'old', 'school', '1970', 'supernatural', 'movie', 'feel', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'gory', 'just', 'creepy', 'witches/devil', 'are', 'there', 'plotting', 'something', 'Things', 'took', 'bad', 'turn', 'when', 'screen', 'flashed', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'psychedelic', 'stuff', 'promoting', 'radio', 'show', 'main', 'character', 'worked', 'Then', 'scene', 'witches', 'being', 'burned', 'Everyone', 'witch', 'never', 'been', 'burned', 'Salem', 'US', 'Burning', 'witches', 'was', 'European', 'thing', 'Salem', 'witches', 'were', 'hanged', 'Salem', 'as', 'close', 'Halloween', 'Town', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'place', 'US', 'Bewitched', 'statue', 'was', 'shown', 'was', 'viewer', 'got', 'see', 'Salem', 'was', 'definitely', 'shot', 'location', 'old', 'buildings', 'are', 'there', 'old', 'graveyard', 'Salem', 'where', 'crypts', 'are', 'practically', 'crumbling', 'weird', 'skeleton', 'angels', 'graves', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'scene', 'When', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'closer', 'reality', 'least', 'something', 'could', 'happen', 'gold', 'Devil', 'Rejections', 'could', 'really', 'happen', 'why', 'so', 'scary', 'Dealing', 'witches', 'devils', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'off', 'campy', 'not', 'scary', 'Did', 'Hocus', 'Pocus', 'scare', 'anyone', 'scenes', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'were', 'art', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'horror', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'Halloween', '2', 'where', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'mother', 'are', 'field', 'are', 'dancing', 'around', 'are', 'LSD', 'trip', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'author', 'investigating', 'witches', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'up', 'more', 'witches', 'were', 'not', 'scary', 'Three', 'old', 'broads', 'drinking', 'down', 'tea', 'five', 'seconds', 'reminded', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'opening', 'scene', 'witches', 'who', 'came', 'back', 'movie', 'where', 'kinda', 'scary', 'scene', 'devils', 'touching', 'was', 'lame', 'lobster', 'baby', 'DJ', 'birth', 'looked', 'got', 'tank', 'Red', 'Lobster', 'fat', 'devil', 'child', 'had', 'connection', 'movie', 'was', 'super', 'cartoony', 'end', 'movie', 'melted', 'down', 'crazy', 'bunch', 'images', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'story', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'mixed', 'credits', 'was', 'old', 'newscaster', 'voice', 'summing', 'things', 'up', 'last', '20', 'viewer', 'music', 'being', 'played', 'descendants', 'Judge', 'townspeople', 'who', 'killed', 'witches', 'point', 'was', 'only', 'clear', 'descendant', 'Judge', 'was', 'bear', 'lobster', 'baby', 'other', 'women', 'being', 'brought', 'slaughter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'move', 'movie', 'Judge', 'townspeople', 'who', 'were', 'hangings', 'are', 'buried', 'cemetery', 'middle', 'Salem', 'creepy', 'old', 'trees', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'location', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'wasted', 'film', 'went', 'rails', 'crazy', 'train', 'not', 'fun', 'ride', 'kind', 'way']",N/A

1643642,AH0PI2S3O1YDP,B00C7C00JU,MonsterZeroNJ,"[1, 1]","If Stanley Kubrick, Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci got drunk and decided to make a horror movie together, Lords Of Salem would probably be close to what you&#8217;d get. Even back in the White Zombie days, rocker/director Rob Zombie has always shown a heavy influence from movies, especially horror so, it&#8217;s no surprise to see such influences in his films. And this time, Zombie sheds the 70s grind-house style that his earlier films have had and goes for something that evokes the work of the previously mentioned filmmakers and also some of the 70s occult themed flicks like the infamous Mark Of The Devil. To a degree, it is Zombie&#8217;s most solid effort as director but, also his most experimental as Lords gets downright head trippy and surreal at times, especially in it&#8217;s last act. If you liked his dream sequences in Halloween 2, there&#8217;s lots more where that came from. Today&#8217;s impatient audiences weaned on cookie cutter horrors and endless sequels may not appreciate what Zombie has done here but, to me it was a disturbing breath of fresh air. In a time of CGI phantoms and overused jump scares, I really like that Zombie had the courage to make something that aims to simply unsettle and disturb you with it&#8217;s atmosphere and imagery and doesn&#8217;t rely on cheap scares and elaborate post production hocus-pocus. Lords tells the creepy story of late night Salem DJ Heidi (Sheri Moon Zombie) who receives a wooden box with a record in it from someone referring to themselves simply as &#8220;The Lords&#8221;. When she plays the vinyl album she suddenly starts to have increasingly disturbing hallucinations and her life starts to spiral out of control. When author Francis Matthias (Bruce Davison) begins to investigate, he finds that an ancient evil in the form of a devil worshiping witch coven, once burned at the stake, may be returning to Salem and Heidi might be key to their vengeance. Director/writer Zombie tells his disturbing tale with a deliberately slow burn yet, never at any moment does he ease up on the atmosphere that something sinister and very wrong is going on here. Whether it&#8217;s the haunting visuals that he fills the film with or the excellent use of Griffin Boice and John 5&#8242;s score&#8230; which evoked Fabio Frizzi and Goblin at times&#8230; the film oozes atmosphere and keeps us involved even if the film&#8217;s narrative flow doesn&#8217;t always follow a tradition path. And as for the visuals, they range from haunting to shocking and as disturbing as they can be, they are also beautiful. This is certainly, at the very least, a visually striking film. And despite all the shocking imagery, I actually feel Zombie showed some restraint at times which made the horror elements all the more horrifying when they arrive. And Rob is not the only Zombie to watch here, Sheri, who proved she had some acting chops as Deborah Myers, is again very effective here as Heidi, a woman with emotional troubles and past bad habits who is being drawn into a living nightmare that she is not equipped to fight. Jeff Daniel Phillips is also good playing one of the two Hermans who DJ with her, a man with feelings for Heidi who tries to help her without knowing the true cause of her emotional down-turn. And Zombie also peppers his film with genre vets like Ken Foree (the other Herman), Meg Foster, Sid Haig and the effectively spooky trio of Dee Wallace, Patricia Quinn and Judy Geeson as Heidi&#8217;s neighbors, who are more then they appear. Overall Zombie has created his most interesting work yet and one that won&#8217;t appeal to everyone. It evokes a type of horror in the vein of Argento&#8217;s early films or Fulci&#8217;s The Beyond, that they don&#8217;t make anymore. But, that&#8217;s why I liked it so much. Zombie remembers a time before the MTV generation when horror films took their time to draw you in and had loads of atmosphere. He also knows, like those films, that there is a time to shock you too, and he does that well.

In 2003 he gave the world of horror a much needed shock to the system with House Of 1000 Corpses. It was raw,gritty,and a great way to to transition out of the slasher revival which found rejuvenation with the Scream films.Though critically his films have mostly fallen on deaf ears,I would venture to say within the next two decades Zombie as a director will be looked at more seriously for his contributions to the genre.With The Lords Of Salem Zombie somewhat stretches out of his comfort zone and tackles a larger film all together,and I got to say I absolutely love the premise behind this movie. Without spoiling too much,a mysterious vinyl record shows up at a radio station and puts a whole town under its influence,though you're really only seeing this madness through the eyes of one DJ at the radio station.For me, the biggest disadvantage The Lords suffers from is that it's perhaps too ambitious. At times I felt you got a real sense of the movies limitations and it's never really successfully covered up,but on the flip side, the film as a whole really kept me engaged in what was going to happen.Zombie really does an amazing job at invoking the whole ""witch"" imaginary as well. He doesn't entice us with over the top,beautiful looking women here. No,instead we see the filthiest,foul mouthed, heathen whores of Satan perhaps we have ever seen on film (or at least the best in a long,long,time).In conclusion, The Lords Of Salem doesn't really offer us the shock value of 1,000 corpses or The Devils Rejects,nor does it carry the heavy weight history of the Halloween franchise,but what it does give us is a great,atmospheric horror setting with a great premise and spooky visuals. Rob Zombie's films are less like a movie and more akin to peeking into his psyche with a music video bent to it. Lords doesn't stray from this formula but I felt it was a more mature film all the same.",4,"Offering up unapologetic horror, The Lords of Salem is Zombie's most ambitious film to date.",1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,2070,"['ask', 'become', 'apparent', 'better', 'yet', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'not', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'maker', 'genre', 'gathered', 'notches', 'belt', 'Rob', 'Zombie', '2003', 'gave', 'world', 'horror', 'much', 'needed', 'shock', 'system', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'was', 'raw', 'gritty', 'great', 'way', 'transition', 'slasher', 'revival', 'found', 'rejuvenation', 'Scream', 'films.Though', 'critically', 'films', 'have', 'mostly', 'fallen', 'deaf', 'ears', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'next', 'two', 'decades', 'Zombie', 'director', 'will', 'be', 'looked', 'more', 'seriously', 'contributions', 'genre.With', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'Zombie', 'somewhat', 'comfort', 'zone', 'larger', 'film', 'together', 'got', 'say', 'absolutely', 'love', 'premise', 'movie', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'mysterious', 'vinyl', 'record', 'up', 'radio', 'station', 'whole', 'town', 'influence', ""'re"", 'really', 'only', 'seeing', 'madness', 'eyes', 'one', 'DJ', 'radio', 'station.For', 'biggest', 'disadvantage', 'Lords', 'suffers', 'perhaps', 'too', 'ambitious', 'times', 'felt', 'got', 'real', 'sense', 'movies', 'limitations', 'never', 'really', 'successfully', 'covered', 'up', 'flip', 'side', 'film', 'whole', 'really', 'kept', 'engaged', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen.Zombie', 'really', 'amazing', 'job', 'invoking', 'whole', 'witch', 'imaginary', 'well', ""n't"", 'entice', 'top', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'women', 'here', 'No', 'instead', 'see', 'filthiest', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'heathen', 'whores', 'Satan', 'perhaps', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'least', 'best', 'long', 'long', 'time', '.In', 'conclusion', 'Lords', 'Salem', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'shock', 'value', '1,000', 'corpses', 'Devils', 'Rejects', 'carry', 'heavy', 'weight', 'history', 'Halloween', 'franchise', 'what', 'give', 'great', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'setting', 'great', 'premise', 'spooky', 'visuals', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'films', 'are', 'less', 'movie', 'more', 'akin', 'peeking', 'psyche', 'music', 'video', 'bent', 'Lords', ""n't"", 'stray', 'formula', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'mature', 'film', 'same']",N/A

The acting in The Lords of Salem by lead character, Sheri Moon Zombie, as ""Heidi,"" is good. There is some beautiful artistic imagery in this movie which highlights the horrific visions of Heidi. Much of the story line takes place in a apartment complex and reminds me of the 1977 horror classic entitled, The Sentinel, starring Cristina Raines, which also takes place in a apartment complex. Cristina's character also suffers from a history of personal problems. Rob Zombie made a good choice having Meg Foster play the role of leading Salem Witch. She did a great job and has an excellent, dark, and foreboding voice.The Lords of Salem is not a typical psychotic, murder, slasher, type movie. It is really Rob Zombie's first OCCULT horror movie thriller/drama. There is some blood, but not much. There is some partial nudity of Sheri Moon Zombie, who is a very attractive woman, and some frontal nudity of the Salem Witches. Some of the Occult Themes include: A child born of sin, symbol of the inverted cross, the dark Catholic Church, possession/pornography, the Goat, ceremonial satanic music, the eternal nature of evil, rebirth, Christ/G-d as the great deceiver, the dark witches coven, and Satan/Lucifer as the great liberator. One final thing to mention is the usage of a record recording in the main plot of The Lords of Salem. This was done very well and created the atmosphere of a dark Witches Sabbath throughout the entire movie. Not since the 2005 horror movie entitled, The Skeleton Key, starring Kate Hudson, have I seen a record recording used so effectively in the story line of a horror movie.I highly recommend The Lords of Salem for horror movie fans.

1643649,AVTICTX2MD3NR,B00C7C00JU,Paula Varjack,"[7, 10]","Part art house, part grind house, and part bad acid trip, Rob Zombie's latest film LORDS OF SALEM swings for the fences but comes up just a bit short.  What might have been a home run instead was perhaps a ground rule double in baseball terms.SALEM starts off decently strong - shot in the actual town of Salem, we immediately begin a day in the life of weird looking Goth hipster lady in her 30's who's a DJ.  One day she gets a crazy record at the station and when she plays it, all hell breaks loose.Part of why this film is simultaneously fascinating and frustrating is that in parts, it works like a pure horror film.  Long hallways and longer dolly shots straight out of THE SHINNING and original HALLOWEEN (strangely enough) help set up some legit scares that could have kept rolling for the entire film as the story, set up, and performances are all pretty good.  The film is helped immensely by the wonderfully over the top music by John 5, who provides some of the best musical stabs since JAWS.But inter cut all through the movie are dreams and dreamlike sequences - including an insaneo witch scene to start the film - all of which are super weird... but not scary in the slightest.  Gross and grotesque yes, scary no.  Which is too bad, 'cause this thing had potential to be one of the scariest flicks ever made.In many ways it's like THE DEVIL'S RAIN or even EGE's own WITCHUNTER in terms of basic story structure (there a coven of child murdering people trying to summon Satan himself).  But LORDS OF SALEM is certainly better then both those films in terms of cinematic style - Zombie is really coming into his own, developing a true style as a film maker.  That's a good thing, right?Yes and no.  In SALEM, Zombie tries to cram one too many cinematic styles for one movie.  He jumps between Kubrickian scenes in a huge theatre, then a witch burning shot that could have been out of a 60's era psychedelic flick like PSYCHOMAINIA.  Zombie goes for the gross out or the grotesque when he was getting plenty of scares without them.  It's stylistic as hell for sure, but if the film was a bit more straight narrative I think Zombie could have squeezed even more horror out of this film.  As it is, there's some bits that try for disturbing but come out as somewhat short - even comedic.  Think South Park's ep called ""Christmas Critters"" and you get the idea.Styles aside, there were some small but important bits of realism he could have gotten, but didn't.  For instance, we see her doing her zany radio show with her 2 friends early on in the film.  All sorts of wacky sounds emanate, in typical shock jock fashion.  Which would be fine if they showed anyone hitting a button to make it happen, or an engineer in the background.  It just seems to be magically happening.  Seems a small detail perhaps, but after the 10th wacky sound blasting over the speakers you have to wonder what supercomputer is making all the noise happen.  That same radio station seems to be huge for a town of some 40,000.  Possible perhaps, but a little unlikely.Likewise we never really get to know the main character at all before it all goes wrong, and because the character is so weird looking to start with (she's got tats everywhere,blond dreads, and really bad taste in clothes), it makes her fall a lot less great then it might have been, knocking some wind out of some drama in the process.  You do care about her, but I think if Zombie had spent just 10 minutes with her character to start the film, it would have helped that feeling even more.All that said, Zombie made his flick.  It's not what anyone else would have done, but that his part of his brilliance.  It's an incredibly watchable film and it has a wonderful cast, including Sherri Moon Zombie as the DJ and Bruce Davidson as a sort of Van Helsing character.  The music as I mentioned before is outstanding and the camera work is super crazy.  The movie meanders from time to time, allowing itself far too many excesses in terms of dream sequences, but ultimately makes up for it with an ending that's simply awesome.

1643650,A2FF11D7REYZMX,B00C7C00JU,"PlanetHell ""EmbraceThatSmothers""","[1, 1]","I went into this movie with pretty high expectations. Unlike the Rob Zombie haters out there, I have enjoyed all of his films to date. Each one presented us with crazy characters, gore, violence, and a sense that we should route for the bad guys in some way. He's taken concepts from past days and turned them upside down, two of which were Halloween remakes.Coming out with an original film was the logical next step. In ""The Lords Of Salem"" we have classic elements like the freaky taped thing, but it's not a VHS it's a record playing some haunting music. It even has different characters, some the usual dirty people we've seen in his films before, and some not. It sets up a play of a particular witch and her mini-coven who put a curse that would last beyond their deaths.What comes out of all this? A lack of actually diving into it's own story. Not much is ever shown or told of the witches outside of their rituals, naked women, and horror shots of ""someone's in the hall"" or ""they seem possessed."" 40 minutes in and most of what you think may happen is speculation, and it stays that way.The writer who seems to know a lot about the Salem witch trials spends the whole movie following a trail that leads to nowhere. The witches curse seems to have no real point but to freak people out and make them act weird.This film completely lacks any excitement and never goes anywhere. Who were the lords of salem? The Witches? The group of men who supposedly killed them, hung them, burned them? Never is made clear.Also, this movie was supposed to based upon Rob Zombie's song ""Lords Of Salem."" It isn't even in the film, and it has nothing to do with the song at all. If he was going for something completely different than it should've been called something else.All in all, this is one of those go-nowhere films that will be forgotten very fast, and fade away back into my wallet after I send it back for a refund.Rob Zombie, don't go down this road. Get back into the game with a third Devil's Rejects film or a movie with actual events occurring.

This movie reminds me of movies that I have seen that are poorly edited, cut up or disjointed. Not to say that this is poorly edited or any of those things bit it is like one of those movies that unnerves you despite it's bad production. Again, I do not think this film has poor production, that is just the subliminal, poetic, jangly, jump-cut kind of impression it gave me. I certainly was entertained and did not look at the clock once. In my opinion, that is a success. We watch movies to take us away, immerse us, lose ourselves. It is just so outside the norm that it is hard for me to say, ""this is a great movie, go see it!"". It was definately not boring.Ever wake up from a nightmare, petrified, then as the morning burns on you forget details but surely remember the feeling of horror? that is kinda like this film. It most definitely leaves me with the feeling that I have witnessed something different, possibly the beginning of something great. I am very anxious to see which direction he takes on his next films. I would say it is important to see this if you care about horror. This may be where people start to imitate the formula. It was impressionistic, like poetry. I, myself, enjoyed it. Too many people need to feel that a story is completely told with no loose ends. Those people will be disappointed. I can recall people saying they did not like Hitchcock because of the unanswered feelings they had after watching his films. Now he is considered a genius.

The promo I had seen was well edited, and was very likely put together by the studio. To the basics: the Blu-ray + DVD plus &#34;ultraviolet&#34; combo is mostly a great idea; the Blu-ray give you lots of space, and I was expecting a lot of extras. The DVD is a nice bonus if you want to see the film on a different unit. What still drives up The wall is the UV download, or more to the point the &#34;stream&#34;; I registered at one stage and tried to get this &#34;UV&#34;running but the two biggest frauds are firstly there is no file to download, and secondly there is a limit on how long you have access to the so-called cloud version. The one really nice thing I liked about this combo pack was the hologram cover: very well done, looks great.So for the most part Rob zombie seems to have progressed a lot. Stylistically the visuals in about 60% of the film work very well, and I like what he has done since it conveys what I think is a unique vision, and definitely a unique narrative. I suspect that some people will find the disjunction between the real and the unreal somewhat hard to deal with in the way Rob zombie has edited this together. I am primarily a fan of Rob's work from his music, and some of his music videos have definitely shown somevisionary styles. It's hard to tell from the commentary just how Rob is trying to present this to people watching his work since by his own admission he seems to put things together in a kind of &#34;decopage&#34;[sp?] Technique where he says in the commentary that there is a montage of elements but the connection from the original Salem trials up to the events in current time sometimes fall apart it seems. I really hate to say that because I buy Rob zombie's CDs and DVDs to support his work from my point of view as a fan. But when he has a huge Blu-ray and all he can bother to throw together is commentary, and fortunately feel a little let down. In the commentary Rob talks about some of the side stories with different characters that he thought might've been good but he did not film them, or if he did he has not let it be known. In some cases it sounds like there may have been a lot of deleted scenes, or alternative material, and I would've liked to have seen that on the Blu-ray. Also, he talks about different actors having fairly uniquereactions to some elements in the film, and even how some of the name actors could not get along; well, it would've been nice to have some interviews with these people, and see what they have to say about the experience. As much as I have enjoyed seeing the film, I feel like he could've packaged more into the Blu-ray. I wish I could give a five for this combo but it feels like I shelled out close to full price to something which they could've easily packaged for under $12, and that's just my pecuniary complaint, ifthey had added in some making of features, design features, interviews with Sid Haig and other Rob zombie film regulars, as well as an interview with the wonderful Barbara Crampton, maybe the price would have been worth it.",4,Lords of&#8230;,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,3125,"['many', 'respects', 'guess', 'had', 'lot', 'expectations', 'film', 'promo', 'had', 'seen', 'was', 'well', 'edited', 'was', 'very', 'likely', 'put', 'together', 'studio', 'basics', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'DVD', '34', 'ultraviolet', '34', 'combo', 'mostly', 'great', 'idea', 'Blu-ray', 'give', 'lots', 'space', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'extras', 'DVD', 'nice', 'bonus', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'different', 'unit', 'What', 'still', 'up', 'wall', 'UV', 'download', 'more', 'point', '34', 'stream', '34', 'registered', 'one', 'stage', 'tried', 'get', '34', 'UV', '34', 'running', 'two', 'biggest', 'frauds', 'are', 'firstly', 'file', 'download', 'secondly', 'limit', 'how', 'long', 'have', 'access', 'so-called', 'cloud', 'version', 'one', 'really', 'nice', 'thing', 'liked', 'combo', 'pack', 'was', 'hologram', 'cover', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'great.So', 'most', 'part', 'Rob', 'zombie', 'have', 'progressed', 'lot', 'Stylistically', 'visuals', 'about', '60', '%', 'film', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'like', 'what', 'done', 'what', 'think', 'unique', 'vision', 'definitely', 'unique', 'narrative', 'suspect', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'disjunction', 'real', 'unreal', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'deal', 'way', 'Rob', 'zombie', 'edited', 'together', 'am', 'primarily', 'fan', 'Rob', 'work', 'music', 'music', 'videos', 'have', 'definitely', 'shown', 'somevisionary', 'styles', 'hard', 'tell', 'commentary', 'just', 'how', 'Rob', 'trying', 'present', 'people', 'watching', 'work', 'own', 'admission', 'put', 'things', 'together', 'kind', '34', 'decopage', '34', 'sp', ']', 'Technique', 'where', 'commentary', 'montage', 'elements', 'connection', 'original', 'Salem', 'up', 'events', 'current', 'time', 'sometimes', 'fall', 'apart', 'really', 'hate', 'say', 'buy', 'Rob', 'zombie', 'CDs', 'DVDs', 'support', 'work', 'point', 'view', 'fan', 'when', 'huge', 'Blu-ray', 'can', 'bother', 'throw', 'together', 'commentary', 'fortunately', 'feel', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'commentary', 'Rob', 'talks', 'side', 'stories', 'different', 'characters', 'thought', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'cases', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternative', 'material', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Blu-ray', 'Also', 'different', 'actors', 'having', 'fairly', 'uniquereactions', 'elements', 'film', 'even', 'how', 'name', 'actors', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'well', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'interviews', 'people', 'see', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'experience', 'As', 'much', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'film', 'feel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'packaged', 'more', 'Blu-ray', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'five', 'combo', 'shelled', 'out', 'close', 'full', 'price', 'something', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'packaged', '12', 'just', 'pecuniary', 'complaint', 'ifthey', 'had', 'added', 'making', 'features', 'design', 'features', 'interviews', 'Sid', 'Haig', 'other', 'Rob', 'zombie', 'film', 'regulars', 'as', 'well', 'interview', 'wonderful', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', 'maybe', 'price', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worth']",N/A

1643673,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B00C7C00JU,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[2, 4]","Rob Zombie's The Lords of Salem is incredibly unsettling. In my opinion, it is the crowning achievement of Rob Zombie's cinematic career.Zombie's films have grown on me over the years. I first saw House of 1000 Corpses upon its initial release, and at the time, I didn't think that it was anything particularly special - but I kept returning to it. I'm not exactly sure why. There was just something about the inherent, unapologetic campiness of it that kept me coming back for more. It was a mess of a film, and it appealed to me precisely for that reason.The Devil's Rejects was released shortly after that. I missed it in theatres, but rented it on DVD. I couldn't make it through the entire film on my first attempt. Sure, Zombie was paying homage to some of the great grindhouse films of the seventies, but this film was relentless in its brutality. At the time, it was unwatchable for me. Years later, I sat through the film in it's entirely and was surprised by how good it actually was, even though it still made me squirm.Along came Zombie's re-imagining of Halloween in 2007, and I loved it. While I missed the subtle, nearly gore-free nature of the John Carpenter original, I knew going in that we were dealing with an altogether different animal in Zombie's version. It was shocking and visceral, providing a back-story of Michael Myer's tortured childhood. As he did in both House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, Zombie populates the film with willfully ignorant, aggressive rednecks, ramping up the discomfort level. All in all, Halloween was an absolutely terrifying thrill ride, featuring an unusually touching performance from Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie.Halloween II was an unfortunate misfire, inspiring lots of unintentional laughter with none of the intensity of the first installment.However, nothing could prepare audiences for what Zombie was going to do next.The Lords of Salem opens in Salem, Massachusetts on a gloomy night in 1696, as a coven of six witches hold a satanic ritual in the woods, led by a woman named Margaret Morgan. They disrobe, dance around the fire, roll around in the dirt, and shout blasphemies. Meanwhile, the Reverend Jonathan Hawthorne plots their demise in his journal.We then dissolve to present day in Salem, as a local DJ, recovering drug addict, and descendant of Jonathan Hawthorne named Heidi (Sheri Moon Zombie, dreadlocks and all), receives a mysterious vinyl album from a band named The Lords.Heidi and her boyfriend take the record home that night to listen to it. As the needle touches the vinyl, the music begins, flooding the room with an eerie jumble of ominous music and strange incantations. Almost immediately, Heidi begins to hallucinate. She experiences visions involving the murder of an infant, an evisceration, and sexual assault at the hands of a deranged priest - as well as strange apparitions which appear in her apartment.lords2Speaking of Heidi's apartment, it is almost unbearably claustrophobic and eerie. Her landlord is an older woman with two strange sisters who seem all too interested in Heidi's comings and goings. Heidi also notices a dark figure at the end of the hall in room number five, which, according to her landlord, is vacant. As the hallucinations become increasingly intense and sacrilegious, Heidi's health begins to decline. The women of Salem are also overcome with a sort of hypnotic spell, after one of Heidi's co-workers plays the Lords album over the radio.Heidi gradually begins to realize that certain forces are plotting against her and using her as a vessel to bring about an unspeakable evil. It all leads to a horrifying and unforgettable finale that left me speechless.The Lords of Salem is one of the best horror films of 2013. It is a no-holds-barred experience, and if you are sensitive to satanic material, then you should avoid this film like the plague. It was almost too much for me, and I like to think that I've seen it all. There is imagery contained within that will shake you to the core, especially if you are not prepared. Other films tread lightly around the subject of witchcraft and devil worship, providing only enough exposure to remove you from your comfort zone and advance the plot. Rob Zombie holds absolutely nothing back, making this one of the most effective horror films of its kind, featuring a totally committed performance from Sheri Moon Zombie, who shows some incredible range here.Zombie has obviously been influenced by Kubrick, Polanski, and Lynch here, borrowing from some of the greatest minds in the history of cinema.

His films are deeply rooted in the dark psychological horror films of the 70's, where the future is bleak and good guys usually don't win... I've got to be in the mood for that sort of thing, and usually I'm not.I have to admit though that for ""Lords of Salem"" everything I saw and read was SO all over the place that I had to sit down and decide for myself exactly what this thing is. And I think overall, while it does have its problems, I have to admit that I liked it. My wife hated it--but I thought it was entertaining, and it stuck with me more than a lot of other ""better"" films. I love Gothic horror, and I crave novelty. This film has its share of both.It really does have a ""Rosemary's Baby"" sort of feel to it, but with one major issue: I really have to agree with a lot of these other reviews that Sheri Moon Zombie, at 43, is getting more than a bit long in the tooth for these sorts of roles. She's just too old, heck, it happens to all of us. In ""Rosemary's Baby"", I felt real empathy for the young and victimized Mia Farrow, attempting to make sense of what was happening around her. In ""Lords"", however, Sheri Zombie is really hard to feel anything for at all... I found myself thinking for most of the film that she looked and acted like an ate-up (and selfish) old junkie, so when she went out and finally copped some heroin, I just didn't care.BTW, people in NA, those who take it seriously at least, don't spend the rest of their time drunk. Call it a faux-pas, you just don't do that.With that being said, the only other issue I had was the bad CGI of everything melting at the end, during the whacked-out ""concert"" montage. To the film's credit, it doesn't use any CG effects; it's very old-school in it's approach... so when those effects were stuck in the end, it felt cheap, like a music video or something.My complaints are minor. The way I look at it, if I put on a film and that film keeps me interested until the end, then that right there is worth the price of admission. And this film did just that. The story, while somewhat clich&eacute;, kept me engaged.

1643681,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00C7C00JU,Tim Janson,"[4, 7]","I appreciate the fact that Rob Zombie has a love of horror both modern and classic, and that&#8217;s what makes this review sad to write.  After seeing The Lords of Salem, and Zombie&#8217;s two ill-fated Halloween remakes, you have to wonder if this is the same guy who directed the depraved but entertaining House of a 1000 Corpses and its sequel The Devil&#8217;s Rejects.  If Zombie was looking to leave an impression on viewers he certainly succeeded.  The sight of a half dozen fat, naked elderly women has definitely left me scarred for life.The Lords of Salem gets its fuel from the infamous Salem Witch trials in the 1690s.  Zombie&#8217;s wife Sheri plays Heidi Hawthorne, a distant relative of Reverend Jonathan Hawthorne who presided over the witch&#8217;s executions.  Heidi is a recovering drug addict and co-host of a local talk radio show along with partners Whitey (Jeff Daniel Philips) and Herman (Ken Foree).  A strange wood box arrives for Heidi at the radio station containing an album by a band known only as &#8220;The Lords&#8221; which they quickly dub the Lords of Salem.  The strange, rhythmic music has a hypnotic effect on several women of Salem who become almost entranced upon hearing it.  The music is also heard by a guest on their radio show, Francis Matthias (Davidson) a local writer who penned a book about the Salem Witch Trials.After hearing the music, Heidi begins to experience terrifying visions.  She investigates a supposedly empty apartment in her building where she finds a neon crucifix and sees a hag-like witch named Margaret Morgan.  Heidi&#8217;s visions become more and more alarming, causing her to slip back into drug use and miss work.  Whitey attempts to help Heidi but runs into opposition from Heidi&#8217;s landlady Lacy and her two sisters.  As Heidi descends further and further into madness, a concert by The Lords of Salem becomes the stage for a ceremony for the witches to summon Satan with Heidi as the coven&#8217;s leader.The Lords of Salem is as about as disjointed a film as I have seen in some time.  It&#8217;s a rambling wreck of incoherent scenes completely lacking in logical narrative.  The film is like one of those 1970s Satantic themed movies as if it were written by a 10 year-old on hallucinogenic drugs.  Zombie borrows liberally from films like Rosemary&#8217;s Baby and The Sentinel but without a shred of those film&#8217;s style and horror.  Zombie is also wildly off with his facts about witchcraft trials and executions in Salem.  Witches were hung, not burned.  One of the presiding Judges in the case was John Hathorne, not Hawthorne.  The early American writher Nathaniel Hawthorne was related to the judge and added the &#8220;w&#8221; to his name in order to distance himself from his notorious ancestor.  Perhaps this is nit-picking on my part but at the very least, Zombie could have got the history correct.Sheri Zombie has appeared in all of her husband&#8217;s films but in supporting roles.  Here she is asked to carry the film almost entirely and she is simply not up to the task.  She&#8217;s emotionless and lacks charisma and spends much of the film mumbling her lines even in the scenes where she is not supposed to be under the influence of drugs.

I get that the guy grew up on Heavy Metal and old black & white Horror movies, but there is twisted and then there is insane. The things that must be going through this mans head, that encouraged him to write something like this, is the true definition of horrific. The film follows a radio DJ in Salem, Massachusetts, who has been seeing some strange things. One day a weird record shows up at the station and the DJ plays it on the air. The seemingly innocent record becomes the most requested song on the station, but not without consequences, as it posses the local female population. I am a fan of his music, so I know how strange and twisted Rob Zombie can be, but even I have my limits. Following one of the best horror films I've ever seen, The Devil's Rejects, I was really looking forward to Zombie's next project. That film was a good story, with strong characters, and an amazing ending. This film is pure garbage, meant to shock and disturb audiences, and it does a very good job of that. From nude elderly women, spitting blood on babies, and opening gateways to hell to scary psychics and beast like creatures running around in the dark, this movie is full of things you just never want to see. Rob's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie stars and the once beautiful, up and coming star of the Devil's Rejects, is now covered in tattoos and looks like she hasn't eaten in months. Her performance is flat and unbelievable, adding to the mountain of manure that this film is offering. I love Horror movies and I love weird stuff, but this was just above and beyond freaking weird. I should have turned the film off when nude witches were spitting blood on babies, but I didn't, I stuck with it and I'm sorry I did.

One night as she is leaving she receives a record from a local band. Playing it when she gets home she begins to feel strange.

I have only seen the Halloween remakes by Rob Zombie and not the other ones he has done but I still had an idea of what to expect and for the most part I was right. The movie,while it was OK and kept me watching did seem slow and repetitive in parts, really just seemed like a movie he wrote as a reason to show off his wife. Bruce Davison is good in this and he really helps the movie out. There is a ton of Satan worship in this so if that bothers you avoid this...but since it's a Rob Zombie movie you kind of expect something like that anyway. Overall, nothing that amazing, but also not that bad, an OK rent for me...horror fans may really like this more then I did though. I give it a B-.",3,A movie that was actually better then I expected.

I didn't, the movie is just...well...kind of a mess. If you've read the book you have a very general idea of the story, unfortunately, the budget for the movie only allowed the most bare bones version of Zombie's original script. What's left is a pretty dull movie, devoid of scares, plotlines, and a sense of coherency in general.It is unlike any of Zombie's other films, which is fine, but it comes across a little TOO different. Now, if you've read the book (based on the original script) you know that it is much more like a traditional Rob Zombie movie. Due to its budget, that was not the film that was made. To be honest, the movie lacked because of it. It's all style and no substance. It's clearly modeled after european horror movies from the 70s' but without the interesting storyline or scares to go along with it. If you listen to the commentary (the only feature on the disc) Zombie is constantly explaining that they had no time and no money to make the film and describes the production as ""chaos"". The chaos has certainly transferred onto the screen. For some directors time constraint and small (very) budgets won't make a huge difference, for Zombie....well, this is the result. It's too bad too, because his original script was a great story.This isn't a total disaster like some want to claim. Some of these one star reviews are childish. This is FAR from the worst movie I've ever seen. It's  just not very good. Period. Some of the imagery, including the setting are really appealing. Those alone elevate it from a ""1 star"" film. The performances ( including Sheri Moon, who is perfectly fine for all the more that is required of her, she has maybe 30 lines) are more than adquete. Some are really quite impressive, but not enough to save the movie.

I loved the line about God also punishing angels when they sinned! The is a total piece of art and in your face representation about  the perils of fighting the good fight. Who you root for is up to you! However, just buckle up because it is going to be a bumpy ride folks! There are some over the top parallels between drug addiction and possession. Ghost, demons, possession, and witches, oh my! I think he hit all the check boxes to entice almost any fan here fellas. This is a winner in my book! You might take it or leave it, but any die hard Rob Zombie fan will appreciate the qualities that were obviously given tremendous thought an placed caringly into the piece.

Showing the 'clich&eacute;' of naked dancing witches invoking Satan around a fire, a few more 'toils' and 'bubbles' and I half expected Macbeth to turn up. The film relies solely upon the story to sustain the audience's interest, and the saying 'too much rope' comes to mind.Sheri Moon Zombie's performance as Heidi detaches the audience, and you feel no sympathy for her, and the only redeemable character is Francis (Bruce Davison). The expected references of the occult, witchcraft and Satan are at the forefront of this film. However, the setting is underused as most of the film takes place inside, and the iconic visual possibility of Salem is a missed opportunity.The film offers soft edged visuals conveying an atmosphere that is heavily reminiscent of the satanic horror films of the 1970's.There are some striking scenes and subtle low angle shots which aim to recreate a style similar to Kubrick minus the atmosphere. The 'head trippy' instances are the only artsy scenes of which inspire colour and originality.Expect a tame and sedated film from Zombie, who has toned down the pace and body count, but cranked up the psychedelic injection of the strange and bizarre. An over complicated story that leads nowhere, leaving the audience feeling lifeless (and not in a good way). If this is Rob Zombie's last horror 'swan song' it disappoints on many levels.The Lords are coming...horror clich&eacute;s galore...with meters of rope trailing behind them....[...]",2,Horror Trunk Review: Cords of the Lords?,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,1519,"['opening', 'scene', 'flashback', 'old', 'Salem', 'Showing', ""'clich"", 'eacute', 'naked', 'dancing', 'witches', 'invoking', 'Satan', 'fire', 'few', 'more', ""'toils"", ""'bubbles"", 'half', 'expected', 'Macbeth', 'turn', 'up', 'film', 'relies', 'solely', 'story', 'sustain', 'audience', 'interest', 'saying', ""'too"", 'much', 'rope', 'mind.Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'performance', 'Heidi', 'audience', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'only', 'redeemable', 'character', 'Francis', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'expected', 'references', 'occult', 'witchcraft', 'Satan', 'are', 'forefront', 'film', 'However', 'setting', 'underused', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'inside', 'iconic', 'visual', 'possibility', 'Salem', 'missed', 'opportunity.The', 'film', 'offers', 'soft', 'edged', 'visuals', 'conveying', 'atmosphere', 'heavily', 'reminiscent', 'satanic', 'horror', 'films', ""1970's.There"", 'are', 'striking', 'scenes', 'subtle', 'low', 'angle', 'shots', 'aim', 'recreate', 'style', 'similar', 'Kubrick', 'atmosphere', ""'head"", 'trippy', 'instances', 'are', 'only', 'artsy', 'scenes', 'inspire', 'colour', 'originality.Expect', 'tame', 'sedated', 'film', 'Zombie', 'who', 'toned', 'down', 'pace', 'body', 'count', 'cranked', 'up', 'psychedelic', 'injection', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'complicated', 'story', 'nowhere', 'leaving', 'audience', 'feeling', 'lifeless', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'last', 'horror', 'song', 'many', 'levels.The', 'Lords', 'are', 'coming', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'galore', 'meters', 'rope', 'trailing', '[', ']']",N/A

The Lords of Salem, however, rightfully deserves a complete trashing.This film is a disjointed mess trying WAY too hard to be arty while simultaneously trying WAY too hard to be shocking and outrageous.  The plot, at its core, is very basic horror movie fare - witches invoke Satan to curse the descendants of the one that brought them low, along with all the female descendents of the original women of Salem.  Just because, apparently, as their dark motives are never explained more than that.  Fortunately, character motivations will be the last thing on your mind as you sit through this film.  What will be on your mind is how close to the end of the movie you are.The Lords of Salem plods and crawls.  The characters are two-dimensional and uninteresting, with obvious motivations (even the ""secret"" bad guys).  It tries REALLY hard to be creepy but the movie is so poorly paced, with characters you don't give a crap about, that all it accomplishes is drawing the movie out.  A decent editor could easily lop off 10-15 minutes of this movie and do no harm to it (which isn't saying much).  Honestly, I probably would have given this film another star had it been less of a yawning time-sink.The Lords of Salem is chock full of nudity.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of it is not the kind of nudity you'd want to see (think of your grandmother, with a good coat of medieval grime on her, giving you the full monty along with the rest of her bridge club).  What is most amusing is that Sherri Moon-Zombie is shown naked lying face down in bed at the beginning of the movie, but her character never again sleeps nude.  Rob Zombie was obviously trying to offset the naked-grandma-mind-bomb he set off in the intro by offering up some eye bleach in the form of his wife au naturale.  Sadly, even her coy nakedness cannot save or redeem this scrambled disaster.  FYI, you get naked-grandma-mind-bombed a few more times throughout the movie.  Consider yourself warned.I would give this movie zero stars were it possible.
