I've always been afraid that I wouldn't do it justice, that I wouldn't be able to convey with the appropriate amount of passion just how amazing this is.  Buffy is the best show that has ever been on tv.  This box set was the first ""tv on dvd"" thing i ever purchased.  I've watched this entire series probably 4 times through, and still get chills at times.  As creator Joss admitted, this show was never about making social commentaries, but that doesn't stop it from hitting close to home.  Sure, this is a show about killing vampires, but it is so much more than that.  In the characters Joss created, we can find parts of ourselves.  This show has some of the best character development I've ever seen.  The box set has some cool bonus features, but nothing worth getting if you already own the individual seasons.  Personally, I really like the box set itself, and from the looks of it, the angel box set that is coming out in a month is the same size and layout, so that is on pre-order already:)  Buffy remains my favorite show of all time, and i highly recommend it to anyone, even people who are not traditional sci-fi fans. I hope this review helps explain how truly amazing this series is.",5,The Best Show.

No need to review the show itself. The box set is great. If you plan on buying all the seasons anyway, go for the one-time big splurge. You get the extra disc, and it's nice and compact.

869114,ALOASKC3N1KDR,B0006IO778,Alan Soyars,"[6, 9]","As a HUGE Buffy fan, I jumped when I heard they were releasing a collector's box set with all seven seasons. I even sold my old sets on ebay hoping to make enough money to buy the Chosen Collection. When I pre-ordered my copy it was only $129.00 and now it has jumped a whopping $40.00.Anyways, about the show. Season One of course had it's cheesy moments. It was a new show with a new concept starting out. Some of the plots were a tad bit lame but enjoyable at the same time. The season finale made up for what the rest of the season didn't have.Season Two was a bit more involved. There was the Buffy/Angel love story developing, and then Angel's curse being broken and Buffy having to make a huge sacrifice.Season Three was the introduction of Faith. Even though Faith ended up being kind of a baddie by the end of the season, I thought she was EXTREMELY cool and you almost sympathized for her because she just seemed to feel alone.Season Four was probably the worst of all the seasons. A secret military operation called the Initiative is hunting vampires and demons. The episode 'Hush' on the other hand was a true masterpiece.Season Five introduced Dawn, the key to a portal which was created in the form of Buffy's sister. Awesome season. The finale will almost make you tear up.Season Six showed Willow becoming more involved in the Dark Magics which ultimately lead to another possible apocolypse. AMAZING SEASON.Season Seven. I liked it. I REALLY liked it. Especially the return of Faith and a cameo by Angel. And of course the Slayers in Training. But the problem was there was too many new character introductions. And a few of them I really didn't like. Hahahaha. Overall it was a great season. I DID however feel slightly disappointed with the series finale.Rating: (Up to 5 stars)Season One:  ****Season Two:  *****Season Three:  *****Season Four:  ***1/2Season Five:  *****Season Six:  *****Season Seven: ****1/2",5,Nice set.

869115,ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B0006IO778,"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster""","[0, 0]","I'm ashamed to admit that I lost track of Buffy after the end of the fifth season. I regret that, as the 6th and 7th seasons sent the characters in interesting new directions. The Season Overview on the DVDs were particularly helpful in reevaluating my negative opinion. Once I understood where Joss and the writers were going, I was able to sit back and finally enjoy the episodes for what they were.Overall, Buffy The Vampire Slayer is the story of a young person's journey from their awkward teenage years to the cusp of young adulthood. Seeing Buffy's transformation from an ebullient uncertain teen to a strong and confident leader is incredible viewing. And the journey of the other characters (Willow and Xander in particular) is no less affecting.This new package is a complete collection of all the previously released Buffy DVD Boxsets.  The only new addition is an extra DVD disc featuring new documentaries about different aspects of the series. My favourite is the retrospective from Cast and crew members. It's great to see that they still have such fond memories of the show that they put so much time, hard work and commitment into.It's great to look back on Buffy over half-a-decade after it ended. Considering mass entertainment's tendency to gravitate towards mediocrity, it's a miracle this show ended up on television at all. It's also a miracle that Joss was able to sheperd the show all the way to its conclusion. Particularly after the experiences of Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing) and Amy Sherman-Palladino (Gilmore Girls).Buffy is (and remains) one of my favourite TV series.

869116,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0006IO778,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[24, 26]","Sadly, throughout television's run, the majority of the shows have bee anywhere from mediocre to just plain bad.  There have been a good number of shows that are actually good, but every once in a while, we are given a show that is not only great, but is truly groundbreaking.  Fortunately for the people of our generation, we have been given Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Joss Whedon's tribute to the blond girl from all those horror movies who always seemed to get herself killed.  While many people quickly dismiss this show as hokey and stupid because of the intentionally campy name, but the show is anything but.  Whedon and his talented staff of writers give us some of the best writing heard on TV while the very gifted cast makes us believe every minute of it, even when they are singing their secrets to each other, trying to communicate without the ability to talk, or dealing with vampires, demons, and evil goddesses from hell.The Series""It's about power."" The First (impersonating Buffy)This is a show about female empowerment; as I said, Joss tried to give power back to the cliched blond girl who always seemed to meet an untimely end.  Enter Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the latest in a line of Vampire Slayers, girls who are mystically chosen at birth to keep the people of this world safe by killing vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness.  Along with her friends Xander (Nicholas Brendan) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and her watcher Ruper Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), the group braves such terrors such as vampires (of course), demons of all varieties, and (gasp!) high school, college, and jobs!  Along with the core four is a group of rotating friends who come and go throughout the series such as Buffy's high school crush Angel/Angelus (David Boreanaz), who turns out to be a vampire cursed with a human soul, Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpentar), Sunndale High's resident b**** queen, Oz (Seth Green), Willow's laconic and lupine boyfriend, Spike (James Marsters), another vampire who starts as a ""Big Bad"", then slowly comes to love Buffy, and Dawn (Michelle Tractenberg), Buffy's ""sister"" who is really ""The Key"" (sorry, it gets a little complicated), as well as many others.  Each season deals with a different aspect of life.  Detailed reviews of each season can be found on their respective web pages.Season 1""Right back to the beginning! Not the bang, not the word... the true beginning. The next few months are going to be quite a ride, and I think we're all going to learn something about ourselves in the process. You'll learn you're a pathetic schmuck, if it hasn't sunk in already. Look at you... tried to do what's right. Just like her. You still don't get it. It's not about right. Not about wrong."" The First (impersonating The Master)Season 1 was the springboard for the series; it was self-contained in case the network didn't pick it up for a second season.  Basically, its purpose was to put forward the mission statement of the series as well as tell an intriguing story.  Many of the episodes this year were stand-alones, with bits of the over-reaching arc put in here and there.  This year, the Big Bad was The Master (Mark Metcalf), the very first vampire.  For a first season, this was very good, although ""Buffy"" hadn't even begun to achieve the levels of quality it would achieve in later seasons.  On a scale from 1 to 10, I give this season a 9.3.Season 2""But you never will. You'll always be mine. You'll always be in the dark with me. Singing our little songs. You like our little songs, don't you? You've always liked them, right from the beginning. And that's where we're going."" The First (impersonating Drusilla)Things really picked up in Season 2; Spike and Dru (Juliet Landau) were introduced, Angelus (Angel's soulless counterpart) returned, and story arcs began to develop that would go on for years to come.  One of the things that makes Joss Whedon such a great writer is that he plans out his stories years in advance, so things flow together very well, and things that don't appear until later seasons are alluded to in the earlier seasons (such as Dawn).  This season's theme was the bad boyfriend in high school and the fact that guys become ""evil"" after you sleep with them.  The trio of Angelus, Spike, and Dru served as the Big Bads this year, and the three of them were great together.  On the other side of the fight, new relationships grew with Buffy and her friends, and the began using the name ""The Scooby Gang"" to describe themselves.  This is probably my third favorite season.  Score: 9.7Season 3""So what'd you think, you'd get your soul back and everything would be jim dandy? A soul's slipperier than a greased weasel. Why do you think I sold mine? Well, you probably thought that you'd be your own man. And I respect that."" The First (impersonating Mayor Richard Randall Wilkins III)After the heart-wrenching season finale of Season 2, which were probably my two favorite episodes, fans wondered what would happen to Sunnydale without Buffy or Angel protecting it.  The premiere found Buffy in LA trying to avoid who she was, while Angel was still trapped in the hell dimension he had been sent to by the demon Acathla (sort of).  Eventually, the pair returns (not at the same time) to Sunnydale for Buffy, Xander, and Willow's senior year in high school.  This year, the theme of ""high school is hell"" is really emphasized.  The relationship Buffy and Angel had can no longer be, Xander's relationship with Cordelia is destroyed, and Willow and Oz are put through some harsh trials.  Meanwhile, The First Evil makes its first appearance, a new Slayer, Faith (Eliza Dushku) comes to town, and the mayor of Sunnydale, Richard Wilkins (Harry Groener) is secretly trying to ""ascend"", which means he will transform into a pure demon.  Buffy and the Scoobies soon learn that the transformation will occur on graduation day, and they must find a way to stop it.  This is my favorite season; it may not have a truly knock-out episode like Hush, Once More With Feeling, Innocence, or Becoming, Part II, but the overall arc is amazing and I can't think of a single episode I disliked.  Score: 9.9Season 4""I can be patient. Everything is well within parameters. She's exactly where I want her to be. And so are you, number 17. You're right where you belong."" The First (impersonating Adam)In Season 4, we saw our heroes move on to college.  This year showed us about hw much life can change after high school; old friendships are hard to maintain, especially when not all of your friends go to school with you any longer.  There was also a government conspiracy, but I think that was more for plot than it was for allegory.  The military cyborg Adam (George Hertzberg) served as the Big Bad this year.  Here was a very interesting villain; Adam was created by the government to be the ultimate super-soldier.  He was part man, part machine, and part monster, and he was extremely intelligent.  His body was so resistant to harm that despite Buffy's superhuman strength, her punches didn't even cause minimal pain to him.  This year, unlike last year, was focused on the individual episodes instead of a grand arc.  This was a bit of a mixed blessing; I really love the grand story-telling methods of Whedon and company, but the individual focus allowed for some of the best episodes in the series' run including Hush and Restless.  Score: 9.45Season 5""More than blood. I'm- you know, I honestly don't think there's a human word fabulous enough for me. Oh, my name will be on everyone's lips. Assuming their lips haven't been torn off. But not just yet. That's all right, though."" The First (impersonating Glory)Many people see Season 5 as the last great season of Buffy, and in certain senses, they're correct.  This was the last season of the show on the WB, and it had a story arc comparable to that of Season 3.  It told the story of Dawn, Buffy's sister... or was she?  Turns out little Dawn is really a mystic Key who opens a cross-dimensional portal back to the home-world of Glorificus (Clare Kramer), also known as Glory for short.  Glory has been trying to get back home for years, and she needs Dawn to do it.  This season had two foci in my opinion; Buffy, Dawn, and their mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) represented a story about family while Glory's arc was about female extravagance.  Glory was an avid shopper and material girl; shoes were one of the only things she liked about our world.  This season saw the return of the grand story arc, with an arc almost as in-depth as Season 3.  Score: 9.85Season 6""Of course she won't understand, Sparky. I'm beyond her understanding. She's a girl! With sugar and spice and everything... useless unless you're baking. I'm more than that. More than flesh-"" The First (impersonating Warren)After Buffy's untimely death in Season 5, her friends became very depressed without her... so they decided to bring her back from the dead.  Unfortunately, the gang doesn't realize that she was in a heavenly dimension, and Earth seems like hell by comparison.  While she finds herself merely going through the motions of being the Slayer, a new threat begins to rise in Sunnydale.  Well, at least they perceive themselves to be a threat.  The group calls themselves the Evil Trio, and it consists of Warren (Adam Busch), Jonathon (Danny Strong), and Andrew (Tom Lenk), three nerds whom Buffy has come in contact with in the past.  While they are never much of a threat, they are an annoying thorn in Buffy's side.  However, neither they nor Dark Willow are the year's Big Bad.  Life itself fills that role this season.  While this concept does sound a little depressing, it's interesting to see where our heroes go this year due to the fact that it seems that nothing can go right for these poor people.  Even though the arc was a little more subtle this year, it was definitely there, and, at least in my opinion, was a very interesting thing to watch.  But probably the best thing about this Once More With Feeling, the musical episode.  This was such a testament to Joss Whedon's ability to write seeing as how he wrote both the dialogue and the lyrics in the episode.  Furthermore, all the actors did their own singing!  Score: 9.25Season 7""It's about power."" Buffy SummersThe final season of ""Buffy"" dealt most directly with the theme of female empowerment.  Also, it served as a kind of ""Thank you"" to the fans of the show seeing as how the writers knew from the beginning of the season that this would be the final season.  In this season, we saw the return of The First Evil, who was now the Big Bad.  The First had found a way to openly wage war on the world, and Buffy and her companions were the things standing in her way.  This year introduced us to the Potential Slayers, girls who could become Slayers if the current Slayer dies, Andrew returns to Sunnydale to provide some very much appreciated comic relief, and we meet an ensoulled Spike.  Also this year, we met Caleb (Nathan Fillion), the mysogonistic ex-preacher who turned out to be The First's right-hand-man.  Caleb's purpose was to further flesh out the female empowerment themes.  This year also tied up a lot of loose ends from previous years and introduced fun new characters as well as further fleshing out the beloved returning cast.  Score: 9.4Overall""Into eachgeneration a Slayer is born, one girl in all the world, a Chosen One,one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires..."" GilesAs I said, this is one of the best show's that TV has seen in a long while.  It has garnered praise from TV critics, philosophers, and fans, and Joss Whedon's universe will remain in the hearts and minds of its fans for many years to come.  The writing, acting, and effects are superb, probably some of the best that has ever been on television.  If you are already a Buffy fan, it's very likely that you already own at least some of the seasons.  If you have just become a fan, this set will not disappoint.  If you have yet to check it out, I would highly recommend checking at least the first 2 seasons out (seeing as Season 1 is only 12 episodes instead of the normal 22).  Some of the all-time best episodes include: ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", ""The Harvest"", ""Prophecy Girl"", ""Surprise"", ""Innocence"", ""Becoming, Parts I and II"", ""Anne"", ""Enemies"", ""Choices"", ""Graduation Day, Parts I and II"", ""Hush"", ""Restless"", ""Checkpoint"", ""Blood Ties"", ""The Body"", ""The Gift"", ""Once More With Feeling"", ""Seeing Red"", ""Villains"", ""Two to Go"", ""Grave"", ""Lessons"", ""Conversations with Dead People"", ""Dirty Girls"", ""End of Days"", and ""Chosen"".",5,"In Every Generation, There Is A Chosen One",1103068800,"12 15,

869118,A2QA9K9Z0XRR0D,B0006IO778,Andy. Gillum,"[0, 0]","No series is perfect.  They all fall prey to bad episodes/storylines, new characters that quickly lose their usefulness once their original purpose is fulfilled (Riley) or loss of core characters (Angel, Cordy).  Buffy was no different.  What made it so extrordinary however was the fact that when it did fall prey to these things, it bounced back.Season One, even though it was perfect & couldn't have been better, wasn't even the best which told you a lot about BTVS.  It set the tone & explained the rules perfectly & The Master was a great villian.  Season Two raised the bar so high however, introducing Spike & Dru while turning Angelius into the perfect villian, Buffy never reached that level again.  Season Three was about change and, true to life, change was an uncomfortable experience.  I thought it peaked with ""Lovers Walk"" & was uneven the rest of the way.  The Mayor, while interesting, didn't keep me on edge like most of the Big Bads & I was sad to see Xander & Cordy break-up.  The last three episodes were great though, especially ""The Prom"".  Season Four seemed to be more even keel & was interesting with the supernatural vs science theme but it lacked the energy that infused the first 3 seasons.  The addition of Spike & Tara was great for the show & Adam was a cool villian.Season Five saw BTVS back in top form almost from the opening bell & the energy return.  The `big picture' feel was back too with the mystery of Dawn & Glory.  Spike became the character a lot of fans wanted him to be & Anya seemed more at home.  ""The Gift"" was my favorite finale.  Season Six showed signs of being BTVS's most intense season ever with Buffy`s return & her relationship with Spike & Willow`s addiction.  From ""Doublemeat Palace"" onward however, it went downhill.  The Trio quickly became a liability & the manifestation of Willow's addiction could've been handled better (I liked Tara).  Season Seven was massive in scope & intense.  The First was the perfect Big Bad for the finale; pure evil, pure genius, pure power.  I loved The Potentials & the end of The Council.  And the ending was pure Joss Whedon genius.

869121,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B0006IO778,Annie Feng,"[8, 19]","this review is kind of a reply to Mark Moore, his review of this series was really interesting and brought up quite a few interesting points.Sex- I agree with you on this one, the sex was a little too extreme, especially for a teen series. One of the reason why I liked Angel better- its sex was more ""reasonable""(at times brilliant), and the show is more for adults than teens, and us adults have less problems with the sex.the numerous slayers- I get what you're saying. But I think Buffy is the most special slayer in terms that she survived two deaths. But since the spell was that a slayer dies, immediately another arouses. so I think logically this could happen. a slayer dies for a while, then revived and she still has her slayer powers. But although yeah, it does seem like she shouldn't have her powers after she died, I have mixed feelings on this oneShoddy vampire physics- Vampires can be killed by sunlight IS in mythology. Except for In the forest Of the Night, pretty much all Vampire novels and what-not said that sunlight can kill a vampire; the clothes turned to dust is to avoid complications, although it's more like when a vampire is staked, it EXPLODES to dust, so the clothes explodes as well. You can't get too technical with this. 'cause if you are, then same thing could be said about the reflection- that the clothes they wear should've reflected while their body do not, so when they look in a mirror they should see themselves as kind of like the Invisible Man. But the reflection thing you're right it does make me scratch my head many times. Why does Angel not have a reflection? and why is it that vampires can be photographed but not reflected? I think the best explaination for that is in Joss-verse the reflection thing is more like a metaphor- that vampires are not ""reflectable"", that they are in the world- hence the photographs and what-not, but not part of it. And this is separate from the soul and no soul thing. I couldn't disagree with you more on the appearance of the vampire. I thought it was brilliant to make the vampire more demonic than dead-person- with-fangs looking. I actually thought vampires look LESS disgusting this way. because they appear more monstrous than bloody. in fact, Buffy/Angel's vampires are the only ones that didn't turn my stomach.humor- I didn't notice about the sexual humor. But it is true that I thought Angel's humor were more mature and funny.Angst- I really don't know what you mean by this. Are you saying that Buffy should be all fun and no drama???Sunnydale- once again you can't get too technical about this, same could said for any modern-fantasy shows there are. One could only assume that some really powerful person covered it all up. Although I did thought about the same thing many timesMade-up Mythology- 1.I actually like it better when writers-creators use their own imagination to create their own world instead of using lots of ""mythology"". 2. the show's theme isn't about vampires or mythologies, it's about using the fantastic elements to reflect a real world. So I don't think the writers should ""educate"" the audience about the vampire mythology. If the audience should choose to study vampires, they could go online or buy books or what-not.Sarah Michelle Gellar as buffy- I hadn't really thought about this- what should a slayer looks like. It's an interesting point, and since I didn't see the original movie I can't compare. But it's true that at times I felt Buffy's movements and hits were kind of weak and slow, not really convincing. But I think maybe the point is the whole more-than-meets-the eye - that she seems like she's weak but she's not. But yeah, I do feel sometimes when she fights it seemed like the vampire just waits for her to hit him.I don't think people mainly like the show for its humor and the blond-turning-into-heroine thing. I think people like it because 1. people love kick-ass, strong faminine characters. 2. The show is about growing up and lots of people- mainly teens can connect to it. 3. all shows have faults, because shows, unlike movies, lasts really long and mistakes would pile up. And movies are checked many times while show's schedules are really tight. 4. Joss's cleverness lies at the ability to create compelling storylines, character transformations, irony, metaphors and what-not.

But if they can throw out one last hurrah with this, then so can I!. There is no questioning the brilliance of the series and everything that came with it, or the incredible impact it had on pop culture and it's genre, but was this latest release really neccessary?. I am about as big a fan as there could possibly be, and would want everything that suits my fancy. But if you are a proud, card carrying member of the Sunnydale elite(like myself), you will already have most of what is here. I shelled out some dough to collect all seven, as I imagine a lot of you did. So, why shell out over a hundred dollars for material you most likely already have?. Besides a new box, some features, and a note from Jess, is it really worth it?. To newbies, yes, or for those fans who haven't been able to require the seasons yet can get them in all in this one stop shopping. But really, it's all about the show. 144 episodes of some of the coolest, funniest, serious, heartbreaking, action packed, and just all around fantastic material put on television. It really is amazing to go from season 1 to the very last episode, ""Chosen"", to see the incredible and amazing transformation the show and the characters took. It was done unlike anything else on television. You can look at any season past the debuting one, and not see the same show. It evolved and grew. I appreciate Buffy's risks and dares. I appreciate that they would take them, whether they were successful or not every time, rather than be a show that just found it's comfortable niche and stayed that way. There has really been nothing quite like it before or since, and probably never will be. A number of episode here just aren't perfect television, but are just some of the boldest, most unbelieveable pieces of work to grace the little tube. It goes much deeper for me. Buffy just didn't give me a show to love and cherish for 7 years. It gave me a much deeper love and appreciation for television in general. Buffy opened the door to a lot of great shows with wonderful writing and turned me on to more as well. Buffy did a lot for the genre and for TV, and there isn't enough praise or enough thanks you could give to Joss Whedon, his crew, and the cast(who have come and gone)during the show's 7 year run.

869124,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0006IO778,barry,"[2, 3]","BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER has to go down in the books as one of the most underrated tv shows ever.  It always had its core cult following but it never became huge.  Part of this was that it was on the WB and at the time it aired many didn't look at the shows on that network as the same quality as that on the main networks.  The same can be said for GILMORE GIRLS.But what we have here is one of the best series ever.  The way it manages to mix excellent acting, believable characters and have them live in a city and world where vampires and demons rule and their high school is directly above the hellmouth, a direct line to hell is amazing.  I am a fan of TRUE BLOOD which is on HBO now and must say that I find the story lines and characterizations on BUFFY much more heart felt, engrossing and believable.  Believe it or not I did not watch BUFFY on tv when it actually aired.  I decided to give it a shot years ago and rented all 7 seasons from Netflix.  Theree months ago I needed a BUFFY fix real bad and purchased the box set from Amazon.  This box set is not childs play.  It is the highest quality box set of any series I have ever seen.  The packaging is so imaginative, sturdy and fits the theme of the show perfectly.  It stands 8 inches high and is 5 1/2 inches wide.  The top lifts up, part of the cardboard box falls down to reveal all the seasons in individual cardboard cases which when grouped together display an awesome pic of Buffy and the Scooby gang.  The discs are securely placed and you also get a great booklet with a synopsis of each episode and a letter from creator Joss Whedon.  There is also a disc of exclusive, never before seen extras.  Each of the series comes with the same extras as the seasons sold individually so what you get with the box set if you already own all 7 seasons is the exquisite packaging, the booklet and the extras disc.  For someone like me who has never purchased the seasons separately it is BUFFY heaven.I understand that when the show aired it was almost cancelled twice.  Watching it in order for the second time (I am now near the end of Season 5) I am stunned and very impressed how the storyline seamlessly flows from season 1 till the end.  Plot lines and characters that become prominent in the shows later times are introduced and hinted at slyly throughout.  I look at the age of the series and am amazed at how it is in no way dated.  Granted, many of the demons can be laughable but the intensity of the acting just makes them a fun novelty.  And the choreographed slaying will always have you in awe.  Some seasons worked better than others and all BUFFY fans have their favorites.  Bottom line they all far surpass the quality of most series on television.This show is the perfect combination of a superb creator with a vision and a cast led by Sarah Michelle Gellar who have the skill to carry out that vision.  Anyone thinking of investing in this series again believe me it is worth it.  The emotional impact that this show delivers and the thrills and chills you get along the way never get old.  This boxed set is a superb investment and this is a series I know I will watch over and over.",5,Excellent box set - excellent series,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,3170,"['THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'go', 'down', 'books', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'tv', 'shows', 'ever', 'always', 'had', 'core', 'cult', 'following', 'never', 'became', 'huge', 'Part', 'was', 'was', 'WB', 'time', 'aired', 'many', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'shows', 'network', 'same', 'quality', 'main', 'networks', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'GILMORE', 'GIRLS.But', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'way', 'mix', 'excellent', 'acting', 'believable', 'characters', 'have', 'live', 'city', 'world', 'where', 'vampires', 'demons', 'rule', 'high', 'school', 'directly', 'hellmouth', 'direct', 'line', 'hell', 'amazing', 'am', 'fan', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'HBO', 'now', 'must', 'say', 'find', 'story', 'lines', 'characterizations', 'BUFFY', 'much', 'more', 'heart', 'felt', 'engrossing', 'believable', 'Believe', 'not', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'BUFFY', 'tv', 'when', 'actually', 'aired', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'years', 'ago', 'rented', '7', 'seasons', 'Netflix', 'Theree', 'months', 'needed', 'BUFFY', 'fix', 'real', 'bad', 'purchased', 'box', 'set', 'Amazon', 'box', 'set', 'not', 'childs', 'play', 'highest', 'quality', 'box', 'set', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'packaging', 'so', 'imaginative', 'sturdy', 'theme', 'show', 'perfectly', '8', 'inches', 'high', '5', '1/2', 'inches', 'wide', 'top', 'lifts', 'up', 'part', 'cardboard', 'box', 'down', 'reveal', 'seasons', 'individual', 'cardboard', 'cases', 'when', 'grouped', 'together', 'display', 'awesome', 'pic', 'Buffy', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'discs', 'are', 'securely', 'placed', 'also', 'get', 'great', 'booklet', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'letter', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'also', 'disc', 'exclusive', 'never', 'seen', 'extras', 'series', 'same', 'extras', 'seasons', 'sold', 'individually', 'so', 'what', 'get', 'box', 'set', 'already', 'own', '7', 'seasons', 'exquisite', 'packaging', 'booklet', 'extras', 'disc', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'purchased', 'seasons', 'separately', 'BUFFY', 'heaven.I', 'understand', 'when', 'show', 'aired', 'was', 'almost', 'cancelled', 'twice', 'Watching', 'order', 'second', 'time', 'am', 'now', 'end', 'Season', '5', 'am', 'stunned', 'very', 'impressed', 'how', 'storyline', 'seamlessly', 'season', '1', 'till', 'end', 'Plot', 'lines', 'characters', 'become', 'prominent', 'shows', 'later', 'times', 'are', 'introduced', 'hinted', 'slyly', 'look', 'age', 'series', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'way', 'dated', 'Granted', 'many', 'demons', 'can', 'be', 'laughable', 'intensity', 'acting', 'just', 'fun', 'novelty', 'choreographed', 'slaying', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'awe', 'seasons', 'worked', 'better', 'others', 'BUFFY', 'fans', 'have', 'favorites', 'Bottom', 'line', 'far', 'quality', 'most', 'series', 'television.This', 'show', 'perfect', 'combination', 'superb', 'creator', 'vision', 'cast', 'led', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'who', 'have', 'skill', 'carry', 'out', 'vision', 'Anyone', 'thinking', 'investing', 'series', 'again', 'believe', 'emotional', 'impact', 'show', 'thrills', 'chills', 'get', 'way', 'never', 'get', 'old', 'boxed', 'set', 'superb', 'investment', 'series', 'know', 'will', 'watch']",N/A

869126,A1PEIYVBP09WGU,B0006IO778,"B. Massey ""George""","[6, 7]","Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the amusing show that I caught every once in a while with friends while it was at its peak in the world of pop culture. I never gave it much thought, was too involved in grittier tv shows, The X Files, ER, even the odd HBO series. Buffy to me was a fun show, occasionally bringing back the magic of 80's movies that were imaginative and fun, without taking themselves too seriously. But that was about as much credit as I was willing to give it.After a while, I'd start catching the show more frequently and watching it without friends. At the start of season 3, I was amazed by it, hooked within one episode. Maybe it was worth running home for after all?I kept up watching, 3 was good, with a few episodes leaving you amazed, 4, despite its obvious changes, I felt was probably better and more imaginative than those that had come before it. In season 5, I gave up. Weird plot turns, a strange sister that didn't make sense, even Fox dropped the show because of this season, so I wasn't planning to waste my time on it.Now this set, every season, every episode. I was considering bagging the first 4 and leaving the rest, but figured 'what the hell'.Season 1 - 4, really, are brilliant. Quirky, great characters, well written, great all round tv and film making. Season 5, has an awful start with 'Dracula', that the writers seem to think is great, but it's not. I know it's not, most fans knew it wasn't, and like me, many of you stopped watching. But somehow, despite season 5 having an empty, slightly flawed feeling for a while, amazingly, it doesn't take long to pick up and be back to almost its very best. The show changes its style, becomes darker. We lose some perks, Xander's not as funny as he was etc, but we get Spike, who may well be the best character in Buffy, with James Marsters certainly giving the best performances in the show. Everything becomes very serious, which is a lot to take when compared with the first 4 light hearted pop culture seasons. It's not really fair to say the next 3 seasons aren't as good as the first 4, certain things aren't, individual plots aren't as good, the monsters look too real and therefore lose the amusing 'Evil Dead' type amusement, the villain of season 6 isn't much of an actress which can get a little annoying, but overall, everything is done superbly, and Buffy turns out to be one of the only shows I've ever seen to actually end before it burned out. Joss Whedon said 'Buffy ended when everyone was still in the game, and that's how you win'. He was right to end it when he did, that way it never became a dissapointment like the tragic final 2 X Files seasons, the current ER's, the constant celebrity fueled new Simpsons episodes, from what I hear, even the 6th season of Sopranos is starting to push it. But Buffy, fortunately maintained whatever it was that made it so watchable in the first place.Like many others, I thought it was trash tv, but I'm happy to say I was wrong. There's actually a lot of artistic vision in this show, and even though I'm no great fan of Joss Whedon's movies, every episode he ever directed was something to look forward to. Fortunately, so were all the others as well.In terms of the DVD set, season 2 has horrible quality, obviously VHS transfers that look like they were chewed up by my cat. Season 3 isn't mch better, but the rest are fine. Yes, the Region 2 has widescreen for seasons 4, 5, 6 and 7, which is cool, but it was shot for full frame tv's like the region 1 version, and this becomes plainly obvious when you start seeing shadows of the boom mike slipping into the sides of the screen (But this is quite rare.)The region 1 version has an extra disc with some more interviews, but the region 2 version that I settled for had enough interviews, commentaries and featurettes for me. There are no Sarah Michelle Gellar interviews unlike the region 1 set that contains one interview with her, but if that's a problem for you, I'm sure you can find many interviews with her on youtube.Now that I've seen all of this, if I could choose, I'd go with the region 1 set, just because the directors didn't frame the shows in widescreen, and therefore you're not actually seeing what they wanted you to see.But hey, that's just me, I'm fussy about that kind of thing.I'll stop rambling now.",5,You thought it lost it at season 5? ...

869129,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B0006IO778,Busy Body,"[4, 4]","Ignorance is a terrible feeling that many people experience at least once in their lives. What a lot of people will still not know is how ignorant they were in their judgement of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, in my opinion, the greatest TV show ever created. Society tends to put down things that they don't understand. They prefer the easy way out - in terms of TV, television for idiots. People don't like to feel like they are idiots and instead of exploring what genius lies out there sit on their backsides being spoon-fed by commercialism day in, day out. Buffy was different.Creator Joss Whedon took his little treasure to the small screen in early 1997 and not only created a superb show, but redefined television and its many themes. He also explored the limits of television - just how far could he push this phenomenon, and in how many directions? The possibilities, season after season, seemed endless. Combined with stunning scripts, a variety of themes including drama, humour, horror and adventure, ground-breaking storylines, and a kick-ass heroine icon, Whedon far succeeded anyone's expectations. The show had a fanatical, ever-expanding fanbase around the world that ran into the millions, but just think how much more successful this show could have been if society had opened its eyes...Everyone knows the premise of Buffy by now: seemingly innocent teenage girl foresees her prophecy to become The Slayer, tries to reject it by moving home, but ultimately realises that her destiny is cemented in her very existence. She was born for this role, and nothing she can do can change it. This DVD Box Set is the perfect way for newcomers to enjoy the show, and for die hard fans to trade in their separate DVD box sets and buy this. It has already been released in the UK where it was presented in a compact red box. 39 discs, 115+ hours, a cool 200. It was also limited to 10,000 copies so virtually all are sold out now - I got No.69 the day it came out.The show ran for seven years and in that time I obsessed over the show like nothing before it. My dad thinks it's rubbish and just for kids, my mum loves it and my sister cried at quite a number of episodes. My dad is a complete fool. Sounds harsh, but in this case, it is true. There are far too many classic moments to mention from the show, but a number of ground-breaking episodes stand out in my mind. Perhaps my favourite episode of the show is ""The Body"" from Season Five where Buffy's mother dies. Listening to Whedon's commentary on this episode is astounding. ""Once More, With Feeling,"" Season Six's iconic musical episode, has been hailed as the greatest hour of television ever created, whilst Season Four's ""Hush,"" the silent episode, pushed the boundaries on what television could be. No one had ever attempted anything like this before and pulled it off to such a stunning effect. The love arc of Season Two between Buffy and Angel is almost legendary, and the story of converting from good to evil is notorious with it.Some of the most amazing characters were developed during this show; characters that are now iconic and cemented in history; characters such as Willow, Xander, Angel, Spike, Anya, Tara, Dawn, Giles, Joyce, Cordelia, Oz and Faith. Every season has a Big Bad, some are better than others, but all are very memorable. My personal favourite is Season Five's Glory. After battling predominantly male baddies, this is the first time Buffy is faced with someone her same height, dress size and sex.Watching over the additional features on these numerous DVD's, you really begin to form a grasp of how much detail and methodical planning went into each and every episode. The sets that were built, the make-up used, the length of filming, and the scripts written really reveal the energy and dedication that went into the making of it. The cast and crew knew they were creating history in the making, and I believe this kept them going on such a hectic schedule.Sarah Michelle Gellar was the heart and soul of the show as an actress. She committed herself to this show for nearly a decade and her payment has resulted in becoming an international superstar with true respect from critics the world over. Joss Whedon, on the other hand, has been hailed a genius, and rightly so. Some may think I'm being ignorant calling this the best show ever as I'm only 17, but hey, it's certainly the best thing I've ever watched, so that's good enough for me.I'd say that by Season Two, Buffy had already become a massive cult success. The actors fit into their roles perfectly, and the crew display an extreme maturity to their approach. This show is a work of true art. It cannot be pinned down, defined or pigeon-holed into one category because it is so eccentric. The diversity of the themes on this show has yet to be topped, and I believe it never will be. The endless puns, the metaphors, the symbolic references, the sharp wit, the hilarity of situations, Buffy has it in abundance. A show that can grip you with its drama and action, make you cry at its emotional expression and laugh out loud at its humour is good stuff in my books. The X-Files was knocked down from being my favourite show of all-time when this came along. Buffy ripped through television like a stomping hurricane, leaving all the pathetic excuses for entertainment in its ferocious wake.

We also watch quite a few of the episodes that are talked about in the book so that the students can see what the author is talking about and engage with her theories.  BTVS is a great show for this because there are interesting portrayals of gender and sexuality that can be argued and discussed in many different ways.  Plus the students find it much more engaging than just reading their text!I recently picked up this collection as a Gold Box deal, and I love it!  It takes up much less room (I finally donated my individual seasons to my program office so I can still use them for class but keep my own copies at home) and I'm so glad that the DVDs are housed in plastic cases - so many of these complete series collections that have come out in the last few years have used cardboard sleeves that easily damage the discs.  This set is well protected in plastic cases with trays.My one minor complaint is that each season has the episode list printed on the inside of the case liner.  Even though the cases are clear, it would be much better if there were a small insert with the episode list in each season to make finding the exact episode you're looking much easier.  This is a pretty minor design complaint, however, and for those who aren't jumping around from season to season and episode to episode as I am in my class may find this even less bothersome than I do.If you are a fan of BTVS, this is a great collection at an already great price, and if you can get it on sale as I did it's a steal!

869140,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B0006IO778,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[7, 8]","When I first saw parts of a Buffy episode many years ago, I quickly dismissed it as just another teenage bubble gum series, but over time I began watching some of the episodes since there was nothing else on and boy did I realize how wrong my initial assesment was. After awhile I began to see how brilliant the show really was, and how it has great depth to the writing, the characters in particular, and how perfectly the sub-plots are all woven together. The humor is really good, quite clever really, and hidden beneath the light hearted take on vampires and demons lies a very serious and deep tone, which deals with all the complexities of human nature. Love, betrayal, growing up, friendship, sacrifice, the dichotomy of the human condition, it's all in the series, and it gets progressively better throughout all 7 seasons.The character development is profound, the dialogue has a surprising amount of depth beneath the teenie-bop surface, and the relationships between the Scooby gang are fascinating, and ultimately very touching.As far as all the mutants, demons and such go, it's similar to the X-Files in that it covers mythology in all sorts of aspects, not just vampires. The X-Files didn't just deal with UFOs even though that was the arching storyline. Same thing with Buffy, the vampire theme was the underlying story that wove it all together, but there are the stand alone episodes and other, non-related monsters that came into being. That's just how the show evolved, and if one sees the series from the beginning, it's very interesting to see how it all ties together and the character growth alone by all the major protagonists is a fascinating study of the human psyche.Whedon's succes in TV is due to the fact that he writes intelligent and engaging plots with rather deep, personal relationships, and for Buffy to last 7 seasons and Angel 5, that is a testament to his talent, especially considering that the latter was a spin-off, which rarely is succesful.Whedon's writing style in his TV series is unique, and it is part of that idiosyncracy with his characters and their dialogue that makes it original and stand out on its own. That's the allure that brought so many fans into the series in the first place, among many other factors such as the arching storylines and complex characters. It was a long and emotional journey from season 1 through 7, and when the audience identifies and sympathizes with the characters on screen, that's a sign of a truly succesful show. Growing with and learning about the heroes of Buffy is what makes it such an incredibly engaging experience, and the fact that none of the characters are stereotypical or two-dimensional makes it believable within the context.I simply cannot recommend this series enough, oh and the music on Buffy really helped set the mood, complementing the stories perfectly.For the box set itself, it is a true collector's edition in every sense of the word.  Each season is made with good quality miniature binders, and the back of each binder forms a large picture of the entire regular cast of Buffy.  The box cover itself is a rather clever design, with a top lid that folds back, with the front cover that falls down, displaying seven seasons in all their glory.  It is made of solid quality, so one can rest assured that one's money is well spent and it will last a lifetime or more.  On the front cover that folds down, there lies the series motto, which nicely sums up the ultimate collection.Once opened, inside the box there is a personal introduction letter by Joss Whedon, briefly detailing his labor of love.  The extra DVD with featurettes that gives an even more in depth look into the spectacular show, for all those fans who simply cannot get enough.  Finally, and perhaps greatest of all, is a thick booklet that starts off with Joss naming his favorite 12 episodes.  It was meant to be 10, but he just could not leave 2 of them out for obvious reasons.  The rest of it details each season and their subsequent episodes.  This is truly a must have for every Buffy fan.",5,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, One of the Greatest TV Shows of All Time",1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,4076,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'parts', 'Buffy', 'episode', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'quickly', 'dismissed', 'just', 'teenage', 'bubble', 'gum', 'series', 'time', 'began', 'watching', 'episodes', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'boy', 'did', 'realize', 'how', 'wrong', 'initial', 'assesment', 'was', 'began', 'see', 'how', 'brilliant', 'show', 'really', 'was', 'how', 'great', 'depth', 'writing', 'characters', 'particular', 'how', 'perfectly', 'sub-plots', 'are', 'woven', 'together', 'humor', 'really', 'good', 'quite', 'clever', 'really', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'light', 'hearted', 'take', 'vampires', 'demons', 'very', 'serious', 'deep', 'tone', 'complexities', 'human', 'nature', 'Love', 'betrayal', 'growing', 'up', 'friendship', 'sacrifice', 'dichotomy', 'human', 'condition', 'series', 'progressively', 'better', '7', 'seasons.The', 'character', 'development', 'profound', 'dialogue', 'surprising', 'amount', 'depth', 'teenie-bop', 'surface', 'relationships', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'are', 'fascinating', 'ultimately', 'very', 'touching.As', 'far', 'mutants', 'demons', 'such', 'go', 'similar', 'X-Files', 'mythology', 'sorts', 'aspects', 'not', 'just', 'vampires', 'X-Files', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'deal', 'UFOs', 'even', 'was', 'arching', 'storyline', 'Same', 'thing', 'Buffy', 'vampire', 'theme', 'was', 'underlying', 'story', 'wove', 'together', 'are', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'other', 'non-related', 'monsters', 'came', 'being', 'just', 'how', 'show', 'evolved', 'one', 'series', 'beginning', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'together', 'character', 'growth', 'alone', 'major', 'protagonists', 'fascinating', 'study', 'human', 'psyche.Whedon', 'succes', 'TV', 'due', 'fact', 'intelligent', 'engaging', 'plots', 'rather', 'deep', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Buffy', 'last', '7', 'seasons', 'Angel', '5', 'testament', 'talent', 'especially', 'considering', 'latter', 'was', 'spin-off', 'rarely', 'succesful.Whedon', 'writing', 'style', 'TV', 'series', 'unique', 'part', 'idiosyncracy', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'original', 'stand', 'out', 'own', 'allure', 'brought', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'series', 'first', 'place', 'many', 'other', 'factors', 'such', 'arching', 'storylines', 'complex', 'characters', 'was', 'long', 'emotional', 'journey', 'season', '1', '7', 'when', 'audience', 'identifies', 'characters', 'screen', 'sign', 'truly', 'succesful', 'show', 'Growing', 'learning', 'heroes', 'Buffy', 'what', 'such', 'incredibly', 'engaging', 'experience', 'fact', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'two-dimensional', 'believable', 'context.I', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'series', 'enough', 'oh', 'music', 'Buffy', 'really', 'helped', 'set', 'mood', 'complementing', 'stories', 'perfectly.For', 'box', 'set', 'true', 'collector', 'edition', 'sense', 'word', 'season', 'made', 'good', 'quality', 'miniature', 'binders', 'back', 'binder', 'large', 'picture', 'entire', 'regular', 'cast', 'Buffy', 'box', 'cover', 'rather', 'clever', 'design', 'top', 'lid', 'back', 'front', 'cover', 'down', 'displaying', 'seven', 'seasons', 'glory', 'made', 'solid', 'quality', 'one', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'one', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'will', 'last', 'lifetime', 'more', 'front', 'cover', 'down', 'series', 'motto', 'nicely', 'sums', 'up', 'ultimate', 'collection.Once', 'opened', 'box', 'personal', 'introduction', 'letter', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'briefly', 'detailing', 'labor', 'love', 'extra', 'DVD', 'featurettes', 'even', 'more', 'depth', 'look', 'spectacular', 'show', 'fans', 'who', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'Finally', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'thick', 'booklet', 'Joss', 'naming', 'favorite', '12', 'episodes', 'was', 'meant', 'be', '10', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'leave', '2', 'out', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'rest', 'details', 'season', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'truly', 'must', 'have', 'Buffy', 'fan']",N/A

Yet I felt no hesitation selling my existing sets off for this baby, due November 15th.For the price of less than three seasons, you get the entire run.  Granted, some people prefer the earlier seasons with Angel, but to me Buffy is an epic story and this set carries the entire run.For those who don't know, Buffy The Vampire Slayer is about the life of a young girl who has been chosen to be a vampire slayer, and her secret, her friends and her family.  Based on a flop Luke Perry vehicle, I, along with many others, was hesitant that this series would be any good and initially ignored it,  however, I eventually caught an episode and immediately fell in love with the series, and it quickly became my favorite show of all time.While companies can use cult fans to gouge them (you can get one season of any given Trek show for almost as much as all 144 episodes here), Fox and Joss Whedon cut the fans a great deal, cheap enough that you can easily get rid of the existing sets and not feel jipped about getting this,  compare this to the insanely priced Sex And The City set, I am a fan of that series as well but I am holding on to those because it's way out of my league pricewise.Granted, not every episode is a winner, there are a few ""Beer Bad""'s and ""The Puppet Show""'s in here, but for the most part, this is a fantastic series and rightfully earned it's place on TV Guide's top 50 shows of all time.This is how I rank the seasons.Season 3 (5/5). The show is at it's peak hereSeason 6 (4.5/5).  This is a polarizing season, it's usually either near the top or bottom of a list.  The clunker episodes this season prevent it from being my favorite, but when this season is great, it's the best the show ever gotSeason 2 (4.5/5).  This is where Buffy really got it's foot off the ground, a wonderful, almost Shakesperian main arc.Season 5 (4/5).  Many great episodes, despite the addition of Dawn.Season 4 (4/5).  Another polarizing season, a slight decline from the last two seasons, and is more of a transitional season between the 1-3 and 5-7 shows, but there are some fantastic episodes here.  Hated mostly for all the Riley.Season 7 (3.5/5).  The last year was good, but you could tell Joss and company were starting to exhaust the franchise.  Works much better in the context of DVD or reruns than it did when it aired on UPN.Season 1 (3/5).  The first season is cute, but very much a far cry from the show it eventually morphed into.This is the only Buffy set to get, you are not going to regret this purchase.",5,Going to be worth every cent,1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,2639,"['must', 'say', 'have', 'purchased', 'Buffy', 'season', 'day', 'release', ""'re"", 'going', 'back', 'almost', 'four', 'years', 'here', 'felt', 'hesitation', 'selling', 'existing', 'sets', 'off', 'baby', 'due', 'November', '15th.For', 'price', 'less', 'three', 'seasons', 'get', 'entire', 'run', 'Granted', 'people', 'prefer', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'epic', 'story', 'set', 'entire', 'run.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'life', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'chosen', 'be', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'secret', 'friends', 'family', 'Based', 'flop', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'vehicle', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'hesitant', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'initially', 'ignored', 'however', 'eventually', 'caught', 'episode', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'series', 'quickly', 'became', 'favorite', 'show', 'time.While', 'companies', 'can', 'use', 'cult', 'fans', 'gouge', 'can', 'get', 'one', 'season', 'given', 'Trek', 'show', 'almost', 'as', 'much', '144', 'episodes', 'here', 'Fox', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'cut', 'fans', 'great', 'deal', 'cheap', 'enough', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'rid', 'existing', 'sets', 'not', 'feel', 'jipped', 'getting', 'compare', 'insanely', 'priced', 'Sex', 'City', 'set', 'am', 'fan', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'holding', 'way', 'league', 'pricewise.Granted', 'not', 'episode', 'winner', 'are', 'few', 'Beer', 'Bad', 'Puppet', 'Show', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'fantastic', 'series', 'rightfully', 'earned', 'place', 'TV', 'Guide', 'top', '50', 'shows', 'time.This', 'how', 'rank', 'seasons.Season', '3', '5/5', 'show', 'peak', 'hereSeason', '6', '4.5/5', 'polarizing', 'season', 'usually', 'top', 'bottom', 'list', 'clunker', 'season', 'prevent', 'being', 'favorite', 'when', 'season', 'great', 'best', 'show', 'ever', '2', '4.5/5', 'where', 'Buffy', 'really', 'got', 'foot', 'off', 'ground', 'wonderful', 'almost', 'Shakesperian', 'main', 'arc.Season', '5', '4/5', 'Many', 'great', 'episodes', 'addition', 'Dawn.Season', '4', '4/5', 'polarizing', 'season', 'slight', 'decline', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'more', 'transitional', 'season', '1-3', '5-7', 'shows', 'are', 'fantastic', 'episodes', 'here', 'Hated', 'mostly', 'Riley.Season', '7', '3.5/5', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'good', 'could', 'tell', 'Joss', 'company', 'were', 'starting', 'exhaust', 'franchise', 'much', 'better', 'context', 'DVD', 'reruns', 'did', 'when', 'aired', 'UPN.Season', '1', '3/5', 'first', 'season', 'cute', 'very', 'much', 'far', 'cry', 'show', 'eventually', 'morphed', 'into.This', 'only', 'Buffy', 'set', 'get', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'regret', 'purchase']",N/A

For all that's worth I can't say this is the best vampire series out there, specially now that vampire movies are back... We have True blood, vampire diaries, the twilight saga, underworld, just to name a few. So why is Buffy so special? Probably because it was one of the first vampire series I can remember...Anyway, I just love the series. When I saw the compete set in a special collection, I just got it. Here's the opinion:The graphics:The graphics are good, not presented on full hd, as this show was made for 4:3 tvs. Still it is presented at a good quality DVD video. The menus are animated, but they are not as well-made as today's disc menus. The colors are really good and you can't see much ""movie grain"". I really wanted this show to be recorded at 1080p Blu-ray Discs, but since its not an option, I would give it a 4 star rating.The sound:The sounds are good. The soundtracks to along with the movies, completing each scene. The opening theme is really catching and can stick in your head for quite a long time. Not in a bad way.... The sound was not recorded in a crystal clear dts-hd, but is good. Too bad it's only presented in stereo. I'd love if it was recorded with surround effects. A 4 star rating is well deserved.The story:Some may find it childish, some may find it too supernatural... Too many monsters.... I tend to disagree. I like the story. It's entertaining, has a touch of humor, a lot of adventure, a lot of weird and even scary monsters... It's not only about monsters, it so has a touch of romance and a lot of friendship and loyalty. I think it deserves a 5 star rating for its mixed up content.The packaging:This set comes in a cardboard kind of box, with all the DVDs separated according to the season they belong to. The outer box is really good looking, serving very well as a display case. The inner DVD cases are well made too, and the DVDs are really well fixed, without the risk of falling down and being damaged. In my opinion, it is worth a 5 star rating. Let's be fair and not compare this box with today's amazing collectors edition boxes...Overall:I would totally rate it 5 out of 5 stars. The only downs are its not recorded in 1080p and dts-HD sound.It's a really must-have for the series fans.

869154,A2PLMMVM7J0128,B0006IO778,Ehkzu,"[5, 7]","Recently I had occasion to re-watch a number of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes, dating back to 1997.There's nothing like that now.We have some comedies that are often quite funny, some dramas that are often quite dramatic, a handful of shows that are well-written and character-driven, and some fantasy shows that actually use the fantasy to explore this reality in ways that shows about this reality cannot.But none combine all of that, as Buffy did.And I find works of art that blend all these elements are more than the sum of those elements--a bit like a great Indonesian Rijstaffel, maybe.Buffy's also more than the sum of its people. The artistic chemistry of show creator Joss Whedon and star Sarah Michelle Gellar was extraordinary, and unmatched by either since (though Whedon's Firefly came close, as did Angel).For the show had the added benefit of exposing people whose good taste is so conventional they can't perceive quality if it comes from unauthorized sources--such as a TV show--such as a TV show with ""Buffy"" in its title--such as a TV show about vampires--such as a TV show about high school--such as a horror show--such as an action show--such as a show that defies the normal conventional boundaries between drama and comedy, intellectual and lowbrow, fantasy and ""realism."" (I put ""realism"" in quotes because innumerable TV shows and movies without a whiff of the supernatural or science fiction in them are vastly less ""realistic"" about human character/actions/motivations than many sci-fi/fantasy shows.90% of TV is sucky (to paraphrase Sturgeon's Rule). So? 90% of opera is sucky. 90% of NYTimes Bestseller novels are sucky (if not more). Really, if you look at the judgment of history of all kinds of works of art, very little really stands the test of time.Which doesn't invalidate all these genres. If just invalidates categorical dismissal.I recommended the movie ""Let me in"" to an acquaintance from church in passing. Later he ran into my wife and asked her what it about about. She said ""It's a vampire movie."" He said ""That's all I need to know.""This guy is very intelligent, but not in this case. He was thinking associatively. Twilight is a juvenile movie series about juveniles for juveniles, therefore all vampire movies are movies about sexuality for the teen girl crowd, all using the same stereotypical vampire metaphors.And this was especially egregious in this case, because the guy knows I'm smart. We've talked about artsy movies many times. But his prejudices overwhelmed such specifics.Ditto Buffy. I've seen the faces of many educated people just congeal when I mention Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Nothing with such a name could possibly be anything but piffle. It doesn't help that the eponymous movie WAS piffle. But dismissers forget that Hamlet was a second-rate play by a long-forgotten author before Shakespeare re-did it as an eternal classic.But another problem arises even for those who buy my argument and are willing to give the show a chance: the first episodes represent the creative team finding their footing. It gets better later, but it's so serialized--essentially it's a 100 hour-long movie--that you can't just skip the first season. You really have to see it from the start, and trust that the glimmers of greatness you see from the start bloom later. And they do.That said, though you'll have to re-watch these episodes in the sequence of the whole show to understand everything that's going on, there are some episodes to try if you need further convincing. However, watching them will inevitably fill your head with spoilers for the episodes you skipped over. Likewise, if you do a little Google research, you'll see which episodes got the most critical acclaim while others are ones you'll probably only see once (apart from references bits of them later).SPOILERS FOLLOW------------So if you require more convincing and are willing to live with spoilers, The Body is the most serious of all Buffy episodes, the least supernatural, the most heartfelt (Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is very close to her mother, has said it was the hardest episode for her to do), and the most artistic in terms of brilliant cinematography, lighting, understated acting, great ensemble work etc. In it Buffy deals with the death of her mother due to non-supernatural circumstances, which means that powerful as she is she can't do anything about it.And Once More with Feeling--the Buffy Musical--is the episode that required the most work on everyone's part, is the only episode shot to seen in widescreen format, and is the only musical or opera ever made to my knowledge where there's a reason why everyone's singing. It's also just about the only TV show musical episode where it being a musical isn't a stunt, but actually advances the plotlines and the story arc significantly. It's also the only musical in which the ensemble ranges from fine singers (Giles and Tara) to expressive singers lacking strong voices (Buffy most notably) to near-non-singers (Willow, Dawn, Zander), and exploits their particular skills perfectly--and which is better for having a range of singing ability like that.The episode just after that, Tabula Rasa, has all the central characters' memories being wiped, forcing them to discover who and what they are. A virgin viewer would get to make those discoveries along with the characters, which could be very entertaining. It's one of the funnier episodes as well.And the episode just after THAT, Smashed, revels in sheer exuberant PG-13-barely kinkiness, showing what might happen when two beings with supernatural physical strength get it on, to speak delicately, in a house not built to withstand that happening.For fans of clever horror movies, the much earlier Hush episode would be a good one to start with. With the added fillip of it including the scene where Buffy and Riley each discover that the other isn't just a college student, with one of the best near-mutually-fatal double-takes in cinema history.-------------END OF SPOILERSBuffy is a vampire show that isn't really about vampires. It's a coming of age story that isn't just about people discovering their sexual/romantic dimensions. It's much bigger than that. It's about the hero's journey--and the journeys of the hero's band of followers as well, for they also have stories, and important ones at that.It's about finding out what you are, what you want to be, what you can be, and ultimately what you must be.",5,Back to Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,6468,"['Recently', 'had', 'occasion', 're-watch', 'number', 'Buffy', 'Vampire',

It's pretty expensive for an average Amazon purchase, so I argued that I just couldn't spend it. But, I'm a huge, huge fan of the show and I found out that I was spending more money and valuable places in my Netflix queue on Buffy episodes. So, I finally had enough one day and bought it. And I don't regret it at all.Lots of other people have evaluated the show, so I'm not going to do that. What I am going to do if give you an idea of what to expect in the actual collection.The pictures are accurate: it's a boxed set with all seven seasons forming one Buffy cast shot. The same extras that come on the individual seasons are included on their original discs. But, as a bonus, you get a booklet with an episode-by-episode breakdown, a note from Joss, and an extra disc that has extras not released before this Collection.The only downside to this collection is that the box is not particularly sturdy.

869157,A1QSZ53SD7QIRD,B0006IO778,"empressT ""Luv2Read""","[2, 2]","I can admit it without embarrassment: I was a BtVS/Joss Whedon ""geek"" from episode 1 when the then-WB Network planted it as a midseason replacement in '97. Being an ""angsty"" 16 year-old myself, I could get completely immersed in the inner workings of the ""Scoobies"" and their day-to-day struggles as trying to be ""normal"" kids in Sunnydale, CA (home of the famous Hellmouth). As I returned week to week, year to year, my life story mimicked theirs (not in the demon-hunting, crime solving way)-growing up in a world that was increasingly spinning faster and faster.Whedon's ability to craft art out of language spawned generations of other shows that tried to be as quirky as BtVS (and usually failed-the only exception I can think of in terms of pop culture reference is the HIGHLY underrated ""Family Guy""). Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) all had ""buffyspeak"" down to a science (leaving Watcher Rupert Giles-Anthony Stewart Head-almost always befuddled). Snappy dialogue and actors who truly ENJOYED honing their craft on one of television's greatest shows EVER, made for 7 seasons that went by too fast.The ""Chosen Collection"" is a great collector's item (even if you purchased the seasons individually) because of the personal touches Whedon and gang included. I really like Joss's inclusion of his Top 10 episodes (12 really). My personal favorites mimic several of his, but with some differences. In no particular order, they were:1. ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"" (season 1, ep. 11)-The idea that one can literally disappear because of how other students treat you resonated strongly with a loner like myself.2. ""Halloween"" (season 2, ep. 6)-Xander becoming a soldier is soo hilarious for me in this episode, but the real key is seeing that bookish Giles wasn't always the easygoing librarian/Watcher he was at present.3. ""Innocence"" (season 2, ep. 14)-Buffy and Angel's passion turns deadly as his true demonic persona 'Angelus' returns. Giles's girlfriend Jenny Calendar provides some needed Intel on what 'may' stop Angelus.4. ""Passion"" (season 2, ep. 17)-The shot of Angelus snapping Jenny Calendar's neck and Willow collapsing after hearing the news of Jenny's murder was the first time (but not the last) I got ""misty"" watching BtVS. David Boreanaz put his stamp as one of television's great vampire characters during this entire season.5. ""Becoming, Part II"" (season 2, ep. 22)-Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland) giving Buffy the ultimate ultimatum about her Slayer duties made me angry at MY parents...Buffy telling Angel to close his eyes before she stabs him through the chest to close the hell dimension portal was heart wrenching.6. ""The Wish"" (season 3, ep. 9)-No Slayer in Sunnydale? Our first intro to Anya (aka Anyanka the vengeance demon) is courtesy of Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) trying to get back her popular girl status. Seeing Buffy not as a fragile, bubbly and kind Slayer is mind-blowing.7. ""Hush"" (season 4, ep. 10)-A disconcerting quiet falls over Sunnydale...this episode shows the brilliance of Joss Whedon's writing and the quality acting of the cast. Groundbreaking TV with no audio for the majority of the episode.8. ""Who are You?"" (season 4, ep. 16)-Dark Slayer Faith (a breakout role for Eliza Dushku) awakens from her coma a year after her epic fight with Buffy. Hell-bent on revenge, she finds a mystical gift given to her by her dead mentor, the Mayor. When she encounters Buffy, they switch bodies, causing mayhem. Both SMG and ED showed so much range in this episode having to capture the other Slayer's 'tude and aura.9. ""No Place Like Home"" (season 5, ep. 5)-Buffy's mom Joyce faints and discovers she is ill. Buffy uses a spell to find out what mystical demon has cursed her mother. While doing so, she sees that her ""sister"" Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) isn't what she seems.10. ""Fool for Love"" (season 5, ep. 7)-The first intense interaction between Buffy and Spike (James Marsters). He explains how he was able to kill 2 Slayers-and how Buffy can avoid being his 3rd. This episode lays the foundation for an awesome story arc between Buffy and Spike in season 6.*I can't adore only 10 episodes, so I've expanded it to 15, maybe :)*11. ""The Body"" (season 5, ep. 16)-From the moment Buffy steps in the house, and the viewer sees Joyce, eyes wide open, on the couch, this episode haunts you. Possibly the most powerful episode in BtVS televistory.12. ""Intervention"" (season 5, ep. 18)-The Buffy-bot Spike orders from Warren fools the Scoobies into believing Buffy has feelings for Spike. Meanwhile on her vision quest in the desert, (real) Buffy finds out that ""death is her gift.""13. ""The Gift"" (season 5, ep. 22)-The episode (and season) SMG was truly robbed of an Emmy/Golden Globe/SAG, etc. Her whispered words to Dawn ""live"" echo as she leaps to stave off the apocalypse. Possibly Buffy's finest hour.14. ""Once More, with Feeling"" (season 6, ep. 7)-Unbelievable writing and composition on Joss's part. The cast really shows off some fine singing chops (especially Anya-Emma Caulfield-and Giles). The first time Buffy kisses Spike with feeling shows hints of things to come.15. ""Tabula Rasa"" (season 6, ep. 8)-This episode is worth its weight in gold when Spike (who's convinced he's Giles's son named Randy) tells ""Joan"" (Buffy) that he's a ""vampire with a soul."" Great writing and direction.*Okay, I tried for 15 episodes, but it's a lost cause. Just a couple of more.*16. ""Gone"" (season 6, ep. 11)-This brought back memories from the first season's ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind."" It was eerie the way Buffy relished her invincibility (thus her anonymity) from her friends and family.17. ""Normal Again"" (season 6, ep. 17)-This was very ""A Clockwork Orange"" in scope. Putting Buffy in a position where none of her core people were was a frighteningly good alternate reality.Joss Whedon showed so much trust and loyalty to the supporting cast of characters (which is rare on network TV). Juliet Landau as Drusilla, Tom Lenk as Andrew, Danny Strong as Jonathan, all of these players had an indelible mark on the series. TV lost an incredible spark when BtVS signed off for good. I can't believe 12 years later...still absolute bliss. ********** stars out of 5!!!!",5,12 years later...still bliss,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,6298,"['can', 'admit', 'embarrassment', 'was',

869164,A254A6HH0Z4CW0,B0006IO778,Geneva,"[2, 4]","I am a die-hard Buffy fan and proud of it. I have been a fan since day one, even recruiting my mom and sisters as big time fans along the way, and really, I never get tired of this show, despite having seen every episode numerous times. I can honestly say ill still be watching this show for many years to come.Despite being a huge fan, I probably wont be buying the collectors set, because I already own each season on DVD individually, so i figure it would be pointless, but I wanted to use this opportunity to give my overall opinion on this show. I read quite a few of the buffy bashing reviews on here, and while I think that's fine, because everybody is entitled to their own opinion, and frankly, buffy really isn't a show for everybody (after all, not everyone can appreciate it for the brilliant show that it is) but I for one want to let everybody know why you should give this show a chance.First of all, as I've already said, this show is brilliant. Granted, it could have gone in the complete opposite direction, and would have been a big time dud, had it fallen into the wrong hands, and had it had different actors in it. (if you've seen the buffy movie, you know what I'm talking about! Kristy Swanson did not do the role of Buffy justice at all....which leads me to one other thing: do not base your opinion of this show on the horrid movie!) all of the actors, luckily, are amazing, and play their characters extremely well, and are really very talented for TV actors, especially Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is extremely impressive in her role as Buffy the vampire slayer. The entire cast has great chemistry, probably the best I've ever seen on a TV show.This show is about a young woman, Buffy Summers (starting off in high school) who not only has to deal with normal, everyday teenage girl stuff, but also has the weight of the world on her shoulders (literally!) as she is forced to fufill her role as The Vampire Slayer, and really, has to save the world on a daily basis from various forms of evil (really, vampires are the least of her problems compared to some of the other things she goes up against!) and unlike other slayers who came before her, Buffy has an advantage: her friends (willow, Xander, and various others, depending on the season) who help her in her non-stop battles against the forces of evil. And then you also have Rupert Giles, Buffys watcher, the guy who is supposed to guide Buffy and help her fufill her slayer duties, but who ultimately grows a strong bond with Buffy and her friends, and is definitely one of the most loveable characters.The show is clever and witty, and it has the ability to not only make you laugh, but also cry, as you can't help but feel for Buffy as you watch the struggles that she must go through, throughout her years as a slayer. The dialouge is powerful and the characters are so well developed, that you can't help but love them.A few highlights of the show:-buffy falling in love with Angel, a vampire who has a soul, and will lost that soul, if he experiences even a moment of true happiness-Buffys ultimate battle against The Master during the season one finale-Buffy dealing with her pain over being killed (and then revived by angel and xander) by the master-Buffys battle against Angel after he loses his soul, (buffy loses her virginity to Angel, which is his moment of true happiness, thus leading him to become evil) and ultimately, she has no choice but to kill him in order to save the world and send him to hell (afterwards she flees LA)-the first episode of season 3, in which Buffy is living in LA, (which is where she ran to after sacrificing angel) dealing with her pain over living in an angel-less world-buffys return to Sunnydale, where she still has to deal with angels absence, but also has to deal with:A) her mother, who is hurt that Buffy left only a note but no explanation of where she had gone, and who is also dealing with the fact that her daughter is a vampire slayerB) Giles, who still harbors a deep feeling of loss over Jenny Calendar (one of Angels victims) and is also upset over not knowing of Buffys whereaboutsC) her friends (xander, cordelia, willow, oz...) who are still dealing with the consequences of Angels rampage and also can't help but resent Buffy for just taking off-the arrival of Faith, the rogue slayer who starts off as a friend, but later becomes Buffys worst enemy-The death of Buffys mother in season 5-spike falling in love with Buffy-the introduction of Buffys little sister Dawn, who is the key to opening up a portal to hell-buffy sacrificing her life to save the world at the end of season 5-buffy having to deal with life after being brought back from the dead in season 6-learning that buffy was in Heaven, and not some sort of hell dimension, as her friends had believed....and those are only a FEW of the great moments of Buffy. And really, if that doesn't want to make you watch this show, then I don't know what will!All I'm saying is, give this show a chance!",5,one of the best shows in TV history,1214352000,"06 25,

Sadly, this box set is literally just the individual seasons, in their individual season packaging, stuffed into a red box. Unless having all the seasons in a single box is somehow important to you, it's pretty likely that you can pick up the individual seasons cheaper than buying the set, especially when I see them at stores like walmart and target at about $15 for 2 seasons shrinkwrapped together.

I thought it was a very good show there were a lot of great moment's to treasure and remember. However as i've been re-watching some re-run seasons of buffy i've come to realise that in the beginning of buffy the producers started off in the right direction by creating and establishing a dark world and a certain fear of the vampires in the first 2 seasons by that meaning that rules for vampires were in place: they burned in sunlight and were afraid of the cross etc but later as the seasons progressed from season 3 onwards it seems the rules went out the window meaning buffy was getting stronger, vampires were longer a threat, vampires didn't always burn in sunlight or could cast a reflection in the mirror etc, while i did enjoy the whole show it's made me realise that i prefare the first 2 seasons best but overall this dvd collection will be great have and watch with the family or own your own",4,Buffy: From Hemery To Sunnydale,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,1679,"['story', 'girl', 'named', 'buffy', 'summers', 'who', 'ordinary', 'popular', 'southern', 'californian', 'girl', 'hemery', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'life', 'will', 'later', 'be', 'thrown', 'turmoil', 'battling', 'likes', 'vampires', 'demons', 'witches', 'then', 'moves', 'sunnydale', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'etc', 'slayer', 'chosen', 'one', 'one', 'female', 'entire', 'world', 'gifted', 'power', 'strength', 'combat', 'such', 'forces', 'darkness', 'So', 'far', 'been', '5', 'years', 'incident', 'burning', 'gymnasium', 'living', 'pass', 'normal', 'average', 'life', 'span', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'predecessors.That', 'story', 'buffy', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'beginning', 'life', 'slayer', 'now', 'review', 'originally', 'watching', 'show', 'way', 'season', '1', 'way', 'season', '7', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'were', 'lot', 'great', 'moment', 'treasure', 'remember', 'However', 'i', ""'ve"", 'been', 're-watching', 're-run', 'seasons', 'buffy', 'i', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realise', 'beginning', 'buffy', 'producers', 'started', 'off', 'right', 'direction', 'creating', 'establishing', 'dark', 'world', 'certain', 'fear', 'vampires', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'meaning', 'rules', 'vampires', 'were', 'place', 'burned', 'sunlight', 'were', 'afraid', 'cross', 'etc', 'later', 'seasons', 'progressed', 'season', '3', 'onwards', 'rules', 'went', 'out', 'window', 'meaning', 'buffy', 'was', 'getting', 'stronger', 'vampires', 'were', 'longer', 'threat', 'vampires', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'burn', 'sunlight', 'could', 'cast', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'etc', 'i', 'did', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'show', 'made', 'realise', 'i', 'prefare', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'best', 'overall', 'dvd', 'collection', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'have', 'watch', 'family', 'own', 'own']",N/A

Out of 144 episodes there were only a few that I might skip during viewing, but the show never failed to amaze me in one way or the other. The Buffy/Angel relationship in season 1-3 was brilliant & emotionally draining. A classic forbidden love. What I really love about this show though is the characters and how they are so real. They experience horrific life experiences like most of us in reality & they learn & grow from these experiences. Sometimes life is too much to face which leads us into the dark side much like what happens to Willow through season 5 & 6. Life isn't always kind & we all have to battle our inner demons. Buffy defined a generation. It changed TV forever, and TV will never be the same again without it. The cast was amazing, the writing was amazing, everything about this show just came together perfectly in the beginning throughout the end. There will never be anything else like it. This boxset is definetly worth owning. It includes 7 individual folders that hold the individual seasons. The design is very unique & the packaging is well done in my opinion. Nothing has broke apart since I received it, it's pretty sturdy & all of the discs were in perfect condition. It also comes with a nice little booklet that is an episode guide that tells what episodes are on what discs & what the episode is about mainly with beautiful red & white pictures of the cast on every page.

869194,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006IO778,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[11, 12]","When they can offer up ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Series,"" it is time for the fans of Joss Whedon's classic cult television series to admit once and for all that the party is over.  Whedon wanted to create a cultural phenomenon and a pop culture icon and since Buffy was named the 13th greatest television character of all time by BRAVO, he has clearly succeeded.  He took the standard horror film clich&eacute; of the blonde in the alleyway being attacked by a monster and turned it upside down by having her slay the monster and for seven seasons ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" kept on with her mission.  Watching these episodes again is a great walk down memory lane:Season 1 (4.6 stakes) is only a dozen episodes but it sets the Buffy verse back on track as we get to forget the campiness of the theatrical film and face the fact that High School is Hell.  Buffy Summers arrives in Sunnydale and has to contend with the Master and his minions, and then learn that Angel is a vampire.  Meanwhile, Xander and Willow have their own dating problems, with giant insects and robots respectively.  In ""Prophecy Girl,"" when the Master kills Buffy, the Slayer returns the favor and then it is time to party.Season 2 (4.8 stakes) contains what I consider to be the dramatic highpoint of the entire series, when Buffy tells Angel that she loves him, kisses him, and then kills him in ""Becoming, Part II.""  It also has the episode that Whedon considers the show's mission statement in ""Innocence,"" when Buffy learns that Angel has become Angelus after their night together and has to face down the Judge with a decidedly unforged weapon.  But there are also the memorable moments when Buffy dances with Zander at the Bronze, Spike and Drusilla first arrive in Sunnydale, our first ""Halloween"" episode, Kendra the Vampire Slayer shows up, Joyce dates Ted, and Angelus arranges a grissly tableau of Jenny's corpse that sends Giles into a murderous rage.  I can ever argue this season has the last truly bad ""BtVS"" episode with ""Go Fish.""Season 3 (5 stakes) on balance is the best season of the show, with the first half story arc focusing on Faith the new Slayer in town combining with that of the Mayor in the second half to set up a most eventful ""Graduation Day.""  Along the way we have SlayerFest '98, ""Band Candy,"" ""The Wish,"" a snow day in Sunnydale, the idiot ritual of the Cruciamentum, ""The Zeppo,"" ""Dopplegangland,"" Buffy's mind reading ability, and Angel showing up to dance with Buffy at ""The Prom.""  At the end of the season Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley wander off to their own television series (see: ""Angel: The Complete Series (Seasons 1-5)"".Season 4 (4.6 stakes) takes Buffy to college, which does not take.  After dealing with demons, such as her roommate and Gachnar, Buffy has to deal with the secret military organization the Initiative, which is responsible for putting a bloody chip in Spike's head so he doesn't chase the other puppies anymore.  The two memorable episodes come back to back, with Willow's will making some changes in ""Something Blue"" and the Emmy nominated ""Hush.""  Buffy gets a new boyfriend in Riley Finn, Xander dates Anya, and Willow falls for Tara.  The new Big Bad is Adam, and there are return visits from Faith and Angel to go with a first meeting with the First Slayer.Season 5 (4.7 stakes) starts with Buffy meeting Dracula and ends with her sacrificing her life in ""The Gift.""  Suddenly Buffy has a sister named Dawn, who turns out to be the Key sought by Glory, who is not a demon but a god.  Buffy gives up on college, Riley gives up on Buffy, Spike orders up a Buffybot, Giles reopens the Magic Box and rebecomes Buffy's Watcher, and Joyce suddenly drops dead, a true portend of the WB finale.Season 6 (4.5 stakes) begins with Willow calling Buffy back from her grave and ends with Darth Rosenberg trying to put the Slayer back in it.  Buffy comes back somewhat different, as does Amy, Dawn becomes a kleptomaniac, and everybody ends up bursting into song.  Buffy and Spike end up together, Willow and Tara end up apart, and Xander leaves Anya at the altar.  That Dark Willow turns out to be the Big Bad instead of the Trio is one of the biggest surprises in the entire series as comic relief turns to real tragedy.Season 7 (4.4 stakes) has the final Big Bad, the First, after Buffy from the very beginning.  With potential Slayers all around the world being killed, Giles brings all the ones he can find to Sunnydale so that they can be trained for the Apocalypse to end the television series.  Also added to the Scoobies are Principal Wood from the rebuilt Sunnydale High, and Andrew, the reformed and only remaining member of the Trio.  Buffy and her friends have to get through the Ubervamp and Caleb to get to the first, and Faith and Angel return for the final battle, although the latter is just an errand boy.Having watched the complete series from start to finish again this month only reconfirms how great this television series was, even if it did not end on the highest note possible.  Whedon's vision remains intact along the way and concludes with a literal manifestation of female empowerment (it is too bad he could not do more commentary tracks, because his are far and away the best to be found on these DVDs).  The cast proved to have a remarkable range of acting ability that allowed them to do everything from farce to high drama, often in the same episode.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is one of the great criers of all time,  there has never been a better best gal pal than Alyson Hannigan's Willow Rosenberg.  The way that time and time again guest actors could turn minor roles into major parts, epitomized by James Marsters' Spike, is another key to the show's success.  Add to this how all of the characters evolved over the years, although the process was usually something akin to a rollercoaster ride.  Finally, the use of music throughout the series was exceeded only by its onslaught of pop culture references.Most amazing to me is that after this operatic series reached its greatest aria with the powerful climax of  ""Becoming, Part 2"" that it continued to be such a solid show.  Even if the top was never again as high, the bottom certainly got raised up considerably after that point.  This is a cult series for a whole lot of reasons and the only reason I do not touch on more of them is that I know these words are only being read by the faithful because the only people who are probably going to buy ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Series"" are going to be those who already have all seven season and are buying them for friends or family (so they will stop borrowing

I am a practical, sensible person.(This qualifier is for non-fans -- fans will not be surprised that smart adults love Buffy)And I LOVE Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a passion.  There is nothing that has ever been on TV before or since that is as good.I was not a fan of vampires/supernatural or sci-fi/fantasy before Buffy.If you like funny, intelligent, touching, amazing TV that is worth watching over and over... Then just buy the series.  But make sure your spouse is also Buffy tolerant...  You will probably become addicted.Favorite episodes: (in no particular order)(season= #)Hush (4), Family (5), Once More With Feeling (6), Becoming part 1&2 (2), Prophecy Girl (1), Lies my Parents Told me (7) and Potential (7), and Earshot (3).  (many more -- but those are all amazing _and_ I love them)Best Episodes: most of the above and ""The Body (5)"" -- which is so truly touching and spot on -- but so very painful it can't be a favorite (too close to home for me).  It is however, one of the best episodes of the entire 7 year series -- a series that also includes ""The Gift (5) in that same season.Characters: I love Faith, Tara, Spike, Dawn and for some strange reason, Johnathan...  as well as Buffy...Worst episode: Doublemeat Palace (6)-  Still has some funny lines, but really Joss and co. ... Were you asleep?? Gross, depressing and dumb.  I'm also not really a fan of Normal Again (6) or the Pack (1)...Apart from that... Buffy Rocks.  Oh and it generated a spin off that is almost as good...  Angel is great, but darker than Buffy.  If you like that too, check out Firefly/Serenity for more Joss Whedon genius.  Firefly and Serenity are very different than Buffy and Angel.  They are set in the far future and not supernatural in nature.

Joss Whedon's Buffy The Vampire Slayer is a series that took the female superhero and re-invented it into this groundbreaking show! After his failed attempt with Buffy at the box office in 1992, the concept of Buffy was revived as a TV series and debuted in the spring of 1997 on the new born WB network. With it's refreshing witty dialogue, horror movie-like atmosphere, well choregraphed fights and memorable characters, Buffy was one of the landmark shows for the WB and TV in general! With her core friends: Willow, Xander, Giles as well as many others who make up the Scooby Gang, Buffy battles countless swarms of demons, vampires and Big Bads that threaten the world she is sworn to protect. All 7 magnificent seasons can be summed up like this:Season 1 (1997)-Buffy Anne Summers, the recent chosen one of a long line of vampire slayers, arrives in Sunnydale with her mother Joyce, hoping to start a better life after her last vampire encounter got her kicked out of school, forcing them to move. But Buffy is unaware that the little simple town of Sunnydale actually is home to the Hellmouth, a mystical portal to hell which is a magnate to a variety of dangerous vampires and demons. But Buffy is not alone in the fight this time, as dorky computer nerd Willow Rosenburg, the goofy funny man Xander Harris, Buffy's new watcher Rupart Giles, Sunnydale's wealthest teen queen Cordelia Chase, and the myterious Angel make up Buffy's Scooby Gang who help the slayer in the battles along the way.

I've only checked the first season so far, but the picture is very grainy, not crisp, and the colors are not bright. It almost reminds you of VHS.

869201,A34R44ZM8YDCYH,B0006IO778,Lilen,"[3, 5]","Whan a vision! I hope this review for 'Buffy' will be around for a while, due to the fact that this show was an amazing piece of art, and I don't care what anyone else has to say about that. Joss Whedon, the series' creator, is an artist, and I look up to him. As an artist myself, I feel he is what this show is really about, Sarah Michelle Gellar is by far one of the very few underrated actresses in Hollywood, you know, the crowd that actually deserve a standing ovation, but while they get snubbed, far worse and less talented actors get the prize. What a waste.Buffy, in my thought, is the strongest character in television today. Let alone the history of tv and cinema alike, remember it was a film before anything, a sucky film at that! There is a difference in strong tv characters, and likeable ones. For instance, Nancy Botwin from the showtime series Weeds is a likeable character, but she makes mistakes, she's a mom, a drug dealer, she struggles, she's human. Not that Buffy isn't all those things (besides the drug dealing part... lol), but she's a hero, she has to be more flexible and advanced. Look at the army she has to look out for. Her friends, her mom, her sister. And even her enemies.Apart from the supernatural aspect of the show, the reason why this show is a need like a drug for most people, is because it deals with real life events and drama. Who in the world can bring to my attention another character in tv that has to deal with helping her mother with an illness all-the-while having to think in the back of her mind that she has a duty to save the world. Everyday.Music is an important part in the emotional drama department of the series, to hear more about that, go to my review of avatar the last airbender, complete season/book two. The mello-dramatic vibe the show resonates is ideal in times that the show brings.Casting is basic, Sarah is a goddess at what she does, no offense to everyone else, but the rest of the cast are just okay. You know, pretty faces in the crowd. Not really giving it their all, after season four you wonder when Willow and Tara are going to stop huffing and panting after every freakin sentence they mutter out of their mouths, reminding you of Stevie from that other minimal show we used to watch... oh yeah, Malcolm in the middle. I mean, I get that they're shy, but do they have to be asthmatic too?The villains throughout the series' arc are better with every season, it makes you wonder if the writers and producers finally got it right toward the ending of the shows' runtime.

You have to play the episodes one at the time which can be kind of annoying if you are trying to have a ""marathon"", but it's perfect if you are watching the entire series while running on the treadmill (that's why I gave it 5 stars).

869203,A3NYZB4V55CZIM,B0006IO778,Liz,"[0, 0]","If you're buying a Buffy box set I really have to assume you like the show so this rating isn't regarding the show itself (which is also a 5 star rating). Instead I'm going to review the box set and its contents.I wish Buffy would be released on Bluray. Why it hasn't been is beyond me. Still, this is a great set. I bought it to replace my old DVDs which I'd had since high school. In the 10-12 years since I'd bought them the cases had been damaged, not to mention the discs. They were well loved. So I decided to replace them. Here's what I can tell you about the set:1. When Buffy was originally released it was in these thick foldout cases that fit into a slipcase. Honestly, they were a little bulky. This boxset includes a traditional DVD case that is slightly thicker to accomodate all 6 discs that each season has (with the exception of season 1 which is 3 discs). I personally like the slimmer cases. They take up way less room on my media rack and they are considerably less weight.2. The box is nice for collectors or to wrap up as a gift. However, keeping the seasons in the box doesn't make much sense. In that regard it's just a cardboard box and not much of a selling point. Keeping them in the box makes storing them on any sort of a media rack look awkward.3. NEVER pay the $200 list price. I've seen it go up as a gold box deal several times, and around the holidays it is always on sale. I paid $59.99 when I got it.4. The last disc in the box set is a bonus disc with special features. There's a lot of Joss Whedon - that's a good think. But Sarah Michelle Gellar is noticeably absent from the extras with the exception of clips they show from the show itself. I'm not crazy about Buffy special features with no Buffy input but that's just me.

869213,AUOIOJ1CSPO99,B0006IO778,Matt B.,"[1, 2]","I have seen many TV shows. Just about every drama/sci-fi/fantasy/action/adventure show to come on TV since the 90s and all I can say is BUFFY is the best one I have seen. The characters are charming and identifiable and the dialogue is ACTUALLY funny and intelligent, and the season-long arcs that develop are intriguing and always fun. Sarah Michelle Gellars sells the teenage girl developing into a heroine act perfectly and the rest of the ensemble make it all the more compelling. Whatever you're preconcieved notions about BUFFY were, and you haven't seen it, throw those preconceptions away. Because odds are you will be blown away by this show. And I know how hyped I sound. But it really is top-notch television, and should belong among the ranks of THE SOPRANOS, THE WIRE and the new BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. The underlying themes found within the series are so relevant to life as we know it, you almost won't notice them but they are there if you look.Every season is great. Sure, some are better than others, but every year Joss Whedon and his slew of writers created new, exciting elements to keep the show fresh. And it is fresh all the way up to the spectacular series finale, so that makes it all the more sad once it is gone.BUFFY has something for everyone--the comedy, the horror, the romance, and the all-out ass-kicking, demon-slaying action. And it never feels cheap, cheesy or contrived. I love it. And I whole-heartedly recommend that you give it a try. It is one of the most rewarding TV experiences you could have.In case you need more to convince you...BUFFY places #2 on Empire's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time List#1 on UGO's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time List#41 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest Shows List#3 on TV Guide's Top 25 Cult TV Shows of All Timeand is included in TIME Magazine's Top 100 Shows of All TimeBTW the spinoff series ANGEL is fantastic too, albeit considerably different from it's sister series. Give that one a go too. There is also a Season 8 of BUFFY in graphic novel form as well as video games and more.Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this DVD collection.

I'm going to open the rest & make sure the DVD's are okay.If you are a Buffy fan, you won't be disappointed.Better than most of the crap that's on TV now.Well, there's a reason you should think before you speak, or in my case wait until you watch an entire series before you write a review.I'm in the middle of Season 7 & man, am I disappointed in this series as a whole.

Adam is the name used in the Dark Shadows story line. Now we've neutered Spike.Season 5. Nice 1st episode, but had to camp it up at the end. The Dawn/Glory story line. How lame to continue calling her Buffy's ""sister"" & mentioning the false memories after everyone knows she isn't ""real"", but an entity in a human shell. If the magic that was holding Glory was falling apart, shouldn't it have happened to Dawn as well? She is so freaking annoying & whiny.Season 6. The geek/nerd squad. I would have flayed all 3 of them at the end of the first episode. Willow kicks a$$, but then we have to stop her.Season 7. Spike has become the proverbial whipping boy literally & figuratively.

869225,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0006IO778,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Fair warning, there are some spoilers ahead.  Nothing that those who have seen the series don't already know, but just be aware...I came on to the Buffy bandwagon rather late into the series. The movie came out while I was in high school and I remember it being pretty bad, so I did not really pay much attention when I heard that a TV show was being made. As a result I never watched one episode until the very end of the 4th season and then from the 5th season on. I just happened to watch that episode as a fluke because the WB happened to be the only channel I could get on my TV right after I moved. Needless to say I am glad that I did.Honestly, had I started watching at the very beginning I may not have stuck with the show. The first season (12 episodes) were really about the show getting a foothold, and establishing the characters. As a result the stories did not always flow as well as they did in the later seasons. What the show did do, even from the first episode on, took the experiences that most of us had in high school and as teenagers in general and presented them as real monsters and demons. When you look back at it, the show tackled issues like living up to parents expectations, peer pressure, abuse, rape, death and sexuality (to name just a few)at a time when I was not politically correct to do so. The show, at its core is really about growing up.I personally think the show peaked with the 5th season. I think the perfect ending to the show would have been Buffy giving her life to save the world. While I did not hate seasons 6 and loved the musical episode in season 6, I just think that had it ended with season 5 the show would have probably never would have been accused of getting stale and holding on too long. In my opinion season 3 was the best of the series. It had the best big bad(s) in the Mayor and Faith, the storyline behind Angel leaving the show, and really started giving substance to the supporting characters. I also very much liked season 4, which dealt with the core group going their own ways, and then having to come back together at the end. While that season saw the departure of Angel and Cordelia (aside from a couple cross over episodes) and the introduction of Riley and the Initiative, it was really about high school friends growing distant as they go to college. It also saw Anya (played awesomely by Emma Caufield) become a series regular.  I know some people really hated the direction season 6 went.  It did go much darker than many of the previous seasons, at least in terms of the main characters.  Granted the nerd trio was kind of lame, but I liked the direction they went in the last few episodes of that season.  I do think the 7th season did a good job of wrapping up the story (especially after Firefly was canceled and Nathan Fillion came on).Chances are anyone reading this by now is a fan of the show, or at least has seen enough of it to know what it is about. For anyone who is a total newcomer to the show, while I cannot say for certain whether you will like it or not, that is totally subjective and depends on your taste, I can tell you it was a funny, dramatic, well written and well acted show. If you are a fan of Joss Whedon in general, and somehow have not seen much of the show (and I doubt that is possible) you will love it, especially from seasons 2-5.  If your only experience was the movie, which was a lot more campy than the series, don't let that cloud your view of the series, and if you are not totally into it in season 1, give it a chance. The series really takes off in seasons 2 and 3. If you were in high school at any point in the early to mid 1990s you will get all the references and jokes.

What made the show a must watch for my daughter and myself is the fact that you rarely get to see a strong female character that is so well drawn.  Buffy starts out as a typically self-absorbed teenager who just wants to be a cheerleader and date the hot guy at school.  When she discovers she is the CHOSEN ONE she resists and attempts to continue living a ""normal"" life.  Over time Buffy becomes a full-fledged hero, who at one point gives her very life to save the world.  There are so many strong episodes in the series.  We watch each character develop and become a part of ""the scoobies"".  This series has heart.

869233,A1CWV11YOHMXJ2,B0006IO778,Nathan L. Baker,"[0, 0]","While you're reading this, keep in mind that I'm gearing my review towards people who aren't necessarily huge Buffy fans yet - perhaps the kind of people that have always had a slight interest in the show, but weren't really old enough to get into the show when it originally aired. I was 10 when it started; I was into Rocco's Modern Life, not vampire dramadies.Having recently become a rabid follower of primetime dramas, I can rest assured in saying that Buffy holds its own to all the shows that are currently front runners with critics and fans alike (shows that will probably be outdated and laughable in a few years). Buffy doesn't get repetitive and agonizingly drawn out like Lost. Plot devices don't repeat and become stale, as in 24, which was a great show in its first 2 seasons. As a result, the seasons of Buffy do NOT lost their repeat value. For instance, I can only watch an episode Family Guy once; any future viewings of the same episode bore me to death within the first 5 minutes. Even in the first two seasons of 24, there isn't much repeat value because the show isn't really layered.As for Buffy, I could watch the show over, and over, and over, and over..... and never get sick of it. Now, if you're not really a big Buffy fan but are interested in this box set - or even if you just want to fill in the gaps of episodes you haven't seen - trust me when I say that you don't have to be a sci-fi/vampire/monster/etc fan to be able to enjoy this. Of course, all of that is in this show. Vampires galore; weird, creepier-than-Jabba the Hutt monsters, witchcraft and magic all have their place in just about every episode. BUT, every episode also has a ""real-life meaning"" as well as a fair mix of humor and melodrama (well, to be fair, there's not that much melodrama).Simply put, if you want to watch a show that treats its audience with a little respect, Buffy may be the only show you'll ever need to watch. Joss and co don't treat their audience as sheep and that's a nice feeling. Plus, if you love talking to your friends about the shows you love - look no further. Buffy allows for many avenues of discussion that will be sure to keep your conversations going.As for the actual complete series box set, it's probably a 4-star; the only reason I don't give it 5 is because the folders that hold the seasons are kind of difficult to remove. Either you have to completely remove the top folders to get to to lower ones, or you have to hold up the top folders (which may dull the edges). Not a big complaint though. The box looks nice on a shelf; it's kind of shiny and the colors really jump at you.The bonus disc is actually really cool. There's an hour long interview with Joss, some writers and cast members. There are other interviews/features which dive into some of the academic and/or technical aspects of the show. The other special features that can be found withing each season are nice as well. One of these is, if I'm not mistaken, an A&E; documentary on the earlier seasons of the show, featuring cast interviews and clips from the show. There are also a few featurettes which give set tours, make-up details, and other behind-the-scenes footage.The episode guide is a nice addition, but I didn't find myself using it very often. For the most part, I've been watching the episodes in order (even after having finished the entire series). However, whenever I do want to find a specific episode, the booklet makes it easy to find. The back of each season folder lists the episodes as well.I bought this set having NEVER seen an entire episode, and as far as I'm concerned I've never been more pleased with anything I've previously purchased.",5,"Not a fan yet?

869234,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0006IO778,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 3]","Joss Whedon's surprisingly visionary Buffy the Vampire Slayer is collected here in it's entirity in this handsome collection.  Throughout the show's seven seasons, the tone of the show matured from a teen-esque drama with vampires to a girl accepting her destiny and facing an oncoming apocalypse, and to the surprise of many the show actually worked thanks to the stong cast and pop-culture laced dialogue, and some astonishingly human stories.  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays our heroine Buffy Summers who is gifted with extraordinary strength and agility to combat vampires and other assorted demons, and the show picks up with her and her mother (Kristine Sutherland) moving to the town of Sunnydale, which just so happens to be home of the Hellmouth.  In the first season, we are introduced to this incarnation of Buffy (Kristy Swanson was the original Buffy in the ill-received feature film which debuted years before the show was created) and the friends she makes in Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander (Nicholas Brandon), as well as her librarian-Watcher Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), and popular ditz Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and who can forget the mysterious Angel (David Boreanaz); the brooding vamprie with a soul who seeks to help Buffy, and eventually fall in love with her.  While the first season isn't much to write home about, the show really picked up in the second half of it's second season, when Buffy and Angel consumate their relationship, which in turn forces Angel to lose his soul and become the powerful, evil vampire he was before he was cursed.  Vampire lovers Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau) were introduced in this season as well, and Spike would continue to play a pivotal role.  As season three opens, Buffy meets rogue slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), and Angel returns from Hell, while Willow finds love with werewolf boy Oz (Seth Green) as the gang prepares to take on the evil Mayor.  Season four finds Angel and Cordelia gone (Boreanaz and Carpenter went to star on the spin-off Angel series) and the gang in college as Buffy finds new love with soldier Riley (Marc Blucas), Willow makes a stunning discovery about herself and finds love with Tara (Amber Benson), and Xander finds love with ex-vengeance demon turned human Anya (Emma Caulfield).  A secret military movement called the Initiative runs tests on vamps and demons, and Spike gets a chip implanted in his head which won't allow him to harm any human, making him an unlikely (and unwanted) ally to the Scoobies.  The villain of this season is arguably the worst of the series with the cyborg Adam, but this season itself wasn't the worst.  As season five opens, Buffy faces off against Dracula, and is followed by demon god Glory (Clare Kramer) who is searching for ""the key"" which has much to do with Buffy's mysterious younger sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg).  This season is the second best of the series, as Buffy and the gang are pushed to their limits like never before (Buffy's mother dies tragically in the classic episode ""The Body""), ending with Buffy sacrificing herself to save her sister, and the world.  But it didn't end there.  Season six opens with Willow dabbling in powerful and dark magic to resurrect Buffy, and even though it works it has some side effects as well.  As Buffy adjusts to life, she begins a dangerous affair with Spike while she contends with three nerds turned villains (Adam Busch, Tom Lenk, and Danny Strong).  This season, the first after the network move from WB to UPN, was undoubtadly the best and most mature of the series, as Xander leaves Anya at the alter, Giles leaves Sunnydale, Buffy has to get a job so Dawn isn't taken away, a rejected Spike looks to gain his back his soul, and Willow becomes addicted to magic, which ends in tragedy as Tara is killed and Willow nearly destroys the entire world on a hellbent, revenge driven rampage.  The seventh and final season of the show saw the old high school get re-built, as well as Buffy becoming the new guidance counselor, and the emergence of the evil force known as the First, which taunts the gang as they prepare for a final battle that not everyone walks away from, and sees the Hellmouth closed and Sunnydale destroyed.  Everything you've just read is only a small summary at best of the series, as there are plenty of classic episodes here, including the silent episode ""Hush"" (season four), the aforementioned ""The Body"" (season five), and the musical ""Once More With Feeling"" (season six); all of which are only highlights of the brilliance that Whedon and his team crafted here.  The cast is and has always been excellent, from Gellar deserving a host of Emmy's for her performances (especially during the second and sixth season's), to Brandon and Hannigan's comic turns, to Marsters' turn from evil villain to a redemption seeking, and eventually reluctant, hero.  For longtime Buffy fans, you already know what's in this box, and if you're a late fan to the show (like I was), then consider this box set worth owning.",5,Welcome to Sunnydale,1130025600,"10 23,

My thinking was that that little blonde girl would never believably get the better of Dracula. However, one of my friends could not stop going on about how brilliant it was. Her exact quote was that it was ""Twin Peaks good"" (in our language that means it's exceptional). Therefore, I gave it another go and watched the first and second seasons back to back over a weekend.The first season was not in any way startling, but it intrigued me enough to carry on watching.  Needless to say, as soon as I saw Spike crash his car into the Sunnydale sign, I was hooked.Buffy is a fantastic, well-written show (Joss Whedon may just be one of the best screenwriters out there) that is filled with brilliant and diverse characters. Apart from the main Scoobies, (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Willow the Witch, Giles the Watcher and Xander the funny one with no powers) you also have OZ the stoic werewolf and Anya the ex vengeance demon, with a very literal turn of phrase. However, my favourite character is Spike, the punk vampire who has killed two vampire slayers and threatens to do evil deeds but is never that successful. In addition, Spike always manages to turn up in time to make insightful suggestions or to make good guys feel better about themselves despite his evil nature (and to put a girly point on it - the man just oozes sex).  All of these characters enrich the show with their very unique sense of humour. Futhermore, their relationships with other characters in the show are as compelling as they are heartbreaking.Each season has its share of fantastic, groundbreaking episodes. Hush, in season four is an almost completely silent episode while the all-singing, all-dancing episode - Once more with feeling adds some spice to season six.Artistically, it should have ended after Season Five when Buffy dies by throwing herself by into a force field of mystical energy to save her sister's life, but who cares about art. Would you have really missed out on Evil Willow or the Spike/Buffy relationship?I have a few issues with the way it ended. Firstly, it got a bit too bleak and depressing in Season Seven. They killed off Spike (but it's Ok he turns up in Angel Season Five so I can just about live with that). Moreover, the way Anya dies - that girl deserved a better death after putting up with non-committal Xander all those years. Nevertheless, the last season did have its moments, the graphics in season finale are amazing and the RJ obsessed episode was one of the funniest Buffy episodes ever (the image of Spike stopping Buffy from killing the Principal Wood with a rocket-launcher is hilarious).Yeah, you may argue that Buffy and Angel banging on about how they can't truly love each other can get annoying at times but it does not alter the fact that Buffy is best teenage drama ever shown on our screens and I wasn't even a teenager when I started watching it!!!",5,"In every generation, there is a chosen one...",1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,3008,"['first', 'ever', 'episode', 'attempted', 'watch', 'Buffy', 'was', 'Buffy', 'Dracula', 'changed', 'channel', 'five', 'minutes', 'thinking', 'was', 'little', 'blonde', 'girl', 'would', 'never', 'believably', 'get', 'better', 'Dracula', 'However', 'one', 'friends', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'going', 'how', 'brilliant', 'was', 'exact', 'quote', 'was', 'was', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'good', 'language', 'exceptional', 'Therefore', 'gave', 'go', 'watched', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'back', 'back', 'over', 'weekend.The', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'way', 'startling', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'carry', 'watching', 'Needless', 'say', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'Spike', 'crash', 'car', 'Sunnydale', 'sign', 'was', 'hooked.Buffy', 'fantastic', 'well-written', 'show', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'screenwriters', 'out', 'there', 'filled', 'brilliant', 'diverse', 'characters', 'Apart', 'main', 'Scoobies', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Willow', 'Witch', 'Watcher', 'Xander', 'funny', 'one', 'powers', 'also', 'have', 'OZ', 'stoic', 'werewolf', 'Anya', 'ex', 'vengeance', 'demon', 'very', 'literal', 'turn', 'phrase', 'However', 'favourite', 'character', 'Spike', 'punk', 'vampire', 'who', 'killed', 'two', 'vampire', 'slayers', 'threatens', 'do', 'evil', 'deeds', 'never', 'successful', 'addition', 'Spike', 'always', 'turn', 'up', 'time', 'make', 'insightful', 'suggestions', 'make', 'good', 'guys', 'feel', 'better', 'evil', 'nature', 'put', 'girly', 'point', 'man', 'just', 'sex', 'characters', 'enrich', 'show', 'very', 'unique', 'sense', 'humour', 'Futhermore', 'relationships', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'as', 'compelling', 'are', 'heartbreaking.Each', 'season', 'share', 'fantastic', 'groundbreaking', 'episodes', 'Hush', 'season', 'four', 'almost', 'completely', 'silent', 'episode', 'all-singing', 'all-dancing', 'episode', 'Once', 'more', 'feeling', 'spice', 'season', 'six.Artistically', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Season', 'Five', 'when', 'Buffy', 'throwing', 'force', 'field', 'mystical', 'energy', 'save', 'sister', 'life', 'who', 'art', 'Would', 'have', 'really', 'missed', 'out', 'Evil', 'Willow', 'Spike/Buffy', 'relationship', 'have', 'few', 'issues', 'way', 'ended', 'Firstly', 'got', 'bit', 'too', 'bleak', 'depressing', 'Season', 'Seven', 'killed', 'off', 'Spike', 'up', 'Angel', 'Season', 'Five', 'can', 'just', 'about', 'live', 'Moreover', 'way', 'Anya', 'deserved', 'better', 'death', 'putting', 'up', 'non-committal', 'Xander', 'years', 'Nevertheless', 'last', 'season', 'did', 'have', 'moments', 'graphics', 'season', 'finale', 'are', 'amazing', 'RJ', 'obsessed', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'Buffy', 'ever', 'image', 'Spike', 'stopping', 'Buffy', 'killing', 'Principal', 'Wood', 'rocket-launcher', 'hilarious', '.Yeah', 'may', 'argue', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'banging', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'love', 'other', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'times', 'not', 'alter', 'fact', 'Buffy', 'best', 'teenage', 'drama', 'ever', 'shown', 'screens', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'teenager', 'when', 'started', 'watching']",N/A

A seminal period for TV and TV audiences.To be fair, that's quite a bold statement, and one that many people will raise more than an eyebrow too. My own perspective is that this is a serialisation of the growing pains of a young woman set against extraordinary challenges. The quality of the scripts, production values and acting are superb, but it's heart is rooted in real life issues that use the supernatural elements to amplify the decisions to life or death choices. By notching up this dramatic arc, we see the perils of those decisions in much brighter clarity.Life is often much more complicated that surviving a fight and the real beauty of this series is that all the decisions that Buffy and co make do have real consequences, that force them to re-evaluate and re-make those choices again and again.Buffy the Vampire Slayer is indeed and important part of TV history, but much more than that, it is a brilliant piece of entertainment that highlights the fight in growing up, in an new and inventive way.",5,Simply Slaying!,1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,1146,"['Back', '2003', 'Times', 'newspaper', 'London', 'called', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'most', 'important', 'TV', 'programme', 'last', '30', 'years', 'seminal', 'period', 'TV', 'TV', 'audiences.To', 'be', 'fair', 'quite', 'bold', 'statement', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'raise', 'more', 'eyebrow', 'too', 'own', 'perspective', 'serialisation', 'growing', 'pains', 'young', 'woman', 'set', 'extraordinary', 'challenges', 'quality', 'scripts', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'are', 'superb', 'heart', 'rooted', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'use', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'amplify', 'decisions', 'life', 'death', 'choices', 'notching', 'up', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'see', 'perils', 'decisions', 'much', 'brighter', 'clarity.Life', 'often', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'surviving', 'fight', 'real', 'beauty', 'series', 'decisions', 'Buffy', 'co', 'make', 'do', 'have', 'real', 'consequences', 'force', 're-evaluate', 're-make', 'choices', 'again', 'again.Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'indeed', 'important', 'part', 'TV', 'history', 'much', 'more', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'fight', 'growing', 'up', 'new', 'inventive', 'way']",N/A
869240,A1ADEVDXQLIUXB,B0006IO778,"Patrick S. Dorazio ""Author of The Dark Trilogy""","[5, 5]","I was never a Buffy fan when the show was on the air.  I had seen the movie and did not think much of it.  I never really heard much about how the writer was disatisfied with the results, that he had a different vision for the idea and when the show came to life it more accurately reflected his vision.  When I first heard about Buffy coming to TV I shook my head in disbelief.  I assumed, like the movie, it would be an extremely campy comedy and would perhaps last a couple of episodes and then would be discarded.I started seeing reviews that praised the show and caught a few bits and pieces.  After a couple of seasons I have to admit that I was curious but had no interest in diving into a TV drama midstream.  I rarely have a fixed schedule so watching week in and week out just was not going to happen.I think over the course of the show's live airings I saw perhaps 2 episodes total.  My regret over not having watched it had grown but then I simply forgot about it after that, for a couple of years.  Angel left the airwaves, another show I had not seen, and I heard how good Firefly was, another Josh Whedon effort.Strange as it may sound, seeing Serenity in the theaters was my introduction to the whole JW universe, which intrigued me enough to buy the Firefly season on DVD and discover how much I really enjoyed it.  Not just because of my enjoyment of all things Sci-Fi but because of the great dialogue and excellent storylines.Which leads me back to Buffy.  After seeing the entire series on Amazon for over a year and it having a spot on my wish list I finally coughed up the dough for it earlier this year.Thus I had the priviledge of seeing the entirety of this series, from the very first episode to the apocalyptic conclusion all within a period of about 4 months with absolutely no previous viewing or experience with the show.  I personally knew no fans of the show, had never discussed it, or had a single presumption going in, except that the critics had loved it and so had its fan base.  So in a way, I guess I am extremely lucky.Viewing the entire series without any interuptions was a dream come true for me.  Sure, there is something to be said about the tension that builds from episode to episode when there are weeks in between their viewing but knocking out an entire season in a week or two does have its advantages.Seeing it all in such a condensed time frame allowed me to see nuances a first time viewer may have missed over the course of seven years vs. several weeks.  The cohesion and constant attention to detail was quite impressive.  I am sure there are ultrafans out there who could easily point out a contradiction or flaw here or there in the logic string of the entire seven seasons but for me it was a fantastic tale from start to finish.The show is fun, which was the goal for me.  Fun characters, fun stories.  I have favorite episodes, characters, and seasons, but all of it comes together so nicely and I also got to avoid any behind the scenes drama that may have taken place during its time on TV, including Sarah Michelle Gellar calling it quits earlier than perhaps others wanted and the show switching networks.  Watching it like this required no compromises, no fear that things would not work out in the end.  All in all, a very blissful experience.My next step is watching Angel, from start to finish, uninterupted and unblemished by any previous viewing.  I am quite looking forward to that as well.",5,Late to the party but lucky nonetheless,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,3464,"['was', 'never', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'never', 'really', 'heard', 'much', 'how', 'writer', 'was', 'disatisfied', 'results', 'had', 'different', 'vision', 'idea', 'when', 'show', 'came', 'life', 'more', 'accurately', 'reflected', 'vision', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Buffy', 'coming', 'TV', 'shook', 'head', 'disbelief', 'assumed', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'campy', 'comedy', 'would', 'perhaps', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'discarded.I', 'started', 'seeing', 'reviews', 'praised', 'show', 'caught', 'few', 'bits', 'pieces', 'couple', 'seasons', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'curious', 'had', 'interest', 'diving', 'TV', 'drama', 'midstream', 'rarely', 'have', 'fixed', 'schedule', 'so', 'watching', 'week', 'week', 'out', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'happen.I', 'think', 'course', 'show', 'live', 'airings', 'saw', 'perhaps', '2', 'episodes', 'total', 'regret', 'not', 'having', 'watched', 'had', 'grown', 'then', 'simply', 'forgot', 'couple', 'years', 'Angel', 'left', 'airwaves', 'show', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'heard', 'how', 'good', 'Firefly', 'was', 'Josh', 'Whedon', 'effort.Strange', 'may', 'sound', 'seeing', 'Serenity', 'theaters', 'was', 'introduction', 'whole', 'JW', 'universe', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'buy', 'Firefly', 'season', 'DVD', 'discover', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Not', 'just', 'enjoyment', 'things', 'Sci-Fi', 'great', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'storylines.Which', 'back', 'Buffy', 'seeing', 'entire', 'series', 'Amazon', 'year', 'having', 'spot', 'wish', 'list', 'finally', 'coughed', 'up', 'dough', 'earlier', 'year.Thus', 'had', 'priviledge', 'seeing', 'entirety', 'series', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'apocalyptic', 'conclusion', 'period', '4', 'months', 'absolutely', 'previous', 'viewing', 'experience', 'show', 'personally', 'knew', 'fans', 'show', 'had', 'never', 'discussed', 'had', 'single', 'presumption', 'going', 'critics', 'had', 'loved', 'so', 'had', 'fan', 'base', 'So', 'way', 'guess', 'am', 'extremely', 'lucky.Viewing', 'entire', 'series', 'interuptions', 'was', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Sure', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'tension', 'episode', 'episode', 'when', 'are', 'weeks', 'viewing', 'knocking', 'out', 'entire', 'season', 'week', 'two', 'have', 'advantages.Seeing', 'condensed', 'time', 'frame', 'allowed', 'see', 'nuances', 'first', 'time', 'viewer', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'course', 'seven', 'years', 'several', 'weeks', 'cohesion', 'constant', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'ultrafans', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'point', 'out', 'contradiction', 'flaw', 'here', 'there', 'logic', 'string', 'entire', 'seven', 'seasons', 'was', 'fantastic', 'tale', 'start', 'finish.The', 'show', 'fun', 'was', 'goal', 'Fun', 'characters', 'fun', 'stories', 'have', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'characters', 'seasons', 'together', 'so', 'nicely', 'also', 'got', 'avoid', 'scenes', 'drama', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'time', 'TV', 'including', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'calling', 'earlier', 'perhaps', 'others', 'wanted', 'show', 'switching', 'networks', 'Watching', 'required', 'compromises', 'fear', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'end', 'very', 'blissful', 'experience.My', 'next', 'step', 'watching', 'Angel', 'start', 'finish', 'uninterupted', 'unblemished', 'previous', 'viewing', 'am', 'quite', 'looking', 'forward', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Well acted, well scripted!2)  Willow and Xander give the Heroine a nice supporting beam, as does the Evil Angel, Good Angel and Spike.The Villains are well played and their plots pretty well thought out.  IT always amazed me that Buffy and Giles didn't spend more time hunting SPIKE, or ANGELUS the true evils...but, what do I know?3)  the introduction of the corrupted Slayer, Faith was a nice touch.  I mean, it wasn't anything new, but Faith's character is whacked out, her dark side quite entertaining, making BUFFY even more a better Hero--ie Batman to Superman.  And, it makes Buffy a more dangerous Hero.4) the fighting sequences were well played out, and it made me feel as if I were part of the action.  It's great to see normal people like Cordelia get in a few whacks!5)  Giles was a great Watcher and co-star to Buffy. I especially liked it when he went after Angelus after he found his dead girlfriend!!  All right!  a kick-assing nerd!theminor plot holes:  When Faith dies, and Kendra dies, and Buffy Dies (again), shouldn't there be a ton of Slayers?  I guess I should have watched 5-8 or whatever, but when they introduced Dawn, it kinda ran the stomach churning on ""bad oysters"" with me.  I mean, I caught glimpses of the last seasons when Buffy ran a whole army of Slayers, but whatever--I lost complete interest after Dawn; and when Spike became a goody-goody.Why, oh WHY, did they have to ruin Buffy with Dawn?  Even Buffy's mom wasn't that bad, and Even introducing Buffy's human boyfriend (forgot his name) was an annoyance, but at least I can understand it.The whole ""Adam"" experiment did not do it for me either.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a television series developed by Joss Whedon and mixes elements of horror, comedy, drama, and adventure. Although there are monsters galore, the main premise of the show is far from the monsters. The monsters and supernatural elements are merely used as a backdrop to explore the nature of human relationships, the angst of being a teenager, the tribulations of growing up, and the quirks of family. Along the way, there are some truly groundbreaking episodes: ""Hush"" with its dialogue-less delivery, ""The Body"" a soundtrack-less exploration of dealing with the death of a loved one, and of course the musical ""Once More with Feeling"". Joss' writing is truly marvelous as he weaves intricate story lines with some of the snappiest dialogue known to man. Each of the main cast members has his/her moment to shine.

That rerun hooked me completely -- so much that I rushed to Amazon and bought all the VHS tapes (back then) of Season 1 & 2 (a whopping 6 per season!)Oh, how times have changed. Now all seven seasons of one of the funniest, scariest, most touching creative works of our time is collected all nice and buyable on DVD.Season 1 introduces us to the poor little blond girl victim who isn't. In a genius pilot, we meet Buffy, she makes friends, and we get swept away in the world (and hell) that is Sunnydale in a way so fresh, so twisted, and so involving it's hard to imagine how other, far poorer shows, once upon a time polluted the airwaves.Season 2 breaks our heart along with Buffy's as love turns to nightmare, in arguably the best run the show ever had. Season 3 brings us a mirror for Buffy in a slayer who goes a decidedly different way, and season 4 unleashes the horror which is University, and the hallmark silent-y episode,  Hush.Season 5 brings a god to the table, and has a quasi-series finale that can contend with the actual one in quality and emotion. Season 6 is hurt all over and the acclaimed musical episode, and Season 7 a somewhat less cohesive than homecoming, with Buffy growing into the mentor role.All in all, a staggering work of creative genius that, unbelievably, is only 1 of 3 so far from Joss Whedon and his Mutant Enemies.Must own.",5,Genre Breaking & Making,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,1486,"['saw', 'first', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'Halloween', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'more', 'saw', 'rerun', 'Season', '2', 'rerun', 'hooked', 'completely', 'so', 'much', 'rushed', 'Amazon', 'bought', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'back', 'then', 'Season', '1', '2', 'whopping', '6', 'season', 'Oh', 'how', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'Now', 'seven', 'seasons', 'one', 'funniest', 'scariest', 'most', 'touching', 'creative', 'works', 'time', 'collected', 'nice', 'buyable', 'DVD.Season', '1', 'introduces', 'poor', 'little', 'blond', 'girl', 'victim', 'who', ""n't"", 'genius', 'pilot', 'meet', 'Buffy', 'friends', 'get', 'swept', 'away', 'world', 'hell', 'Sunnydale', 'way', 'so', 'fresh', 'so', 'twisted', 'so', 'involving', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'other', 'far', 'poorer', 'shows', 'once', 'time', 'polluted', 'airwaves.Season', '2', 'breaks', 'heart', 'Buffy', 'love', 'nightmare', 'arguably', 'best', 'run', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'Season', '3', 'brings', 'mirror', 'Buffy', 'slayer', 'who', 'decidedly', 'different', 'way', 'season', '4', 'horror', 'University', 'hallmark', 'silent-y', 'episode', 'Hush.Season', '5', 'god', 'table', 'quasi-series', 'finale', 'can', 'contend', 'actual', 'one', 'quality', 'emotion', 'Season', '6', 'hurt', 'acclaimed', 'musical', 'episode', 'Season', '7', 'somewhat', 'less', 'cohesive', 'homecoming', 'Buffy', 'growing', 'mentor', 'role.All', 'staggering', 'work', 'creative', 'genius', 'unbelievably', 'only', '1', '3', 'so', 'far', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Mutant', 'Enemies.Must', 'own']",N/A

869249,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0006IO778,Robert Moore,"[701, 745]","Most serious fans of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE already own all of the individual sets that make up this DVD collection, so I thought I would address this review to those who own none of them and will make up the primary target for this set and focus on two questions. First, how does this set differ from the individual season collections? The answer is that they are identical. This set does not represent a new product in any way, but merely collects all of the seasons in a new, low price. If you don't own any of the individual seasons, this is an absolutely ideal way to discover the Buffyverse. Second (and for me this is the fun part), what's this Buffy chick all about?What sets BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER apart from most other shows, apart from the individual brilliant scripts that graced most of the episodes, is that the show over the course of seven seasons tells a story. What the casual viewer of the show could easily miss is the semi-tragic themes underlying the series: young, happy cheerleader and inevitable prom queen is pulled away by destiny from the life she loves to unwillingly undertake the burden of being her generation's Chosen One: a super-empowered heroine to fight against the powers of darkness. This is a responsibility she has neither sought nor desired, and one of the persistent themes of the show is that destiny basically dealt Buffy a nasty set of cards. Sure, she has super strength and agility and recuperative powers, but she also knows how she became The Slayer: someone else died. For one becomes the Slayer only by the death of another Slayer, which calls attention to the fact that she, too, is destined to die to make way for another Slayer. As she puts it in one episode, ""Every slayer comes with an expiration date."" She goes from a carefree, happy young girl to someone who wonders if she will make it to the age of 25.Ultimately, however, the show isn't about a girl with super powers, but about taking responsibility for one's life, for accepting the cards that life has dealt one and making the most of that. Over the course of seven seasons all of the major characters struggle with this precise issue. All of them continually have to face up to the demands of the moral, and what is unusual for a genre show, they all have to work hard to be better people. More than about fighting vampires, the show is ultimately about the fighting of one's inner demons, with the external monsters being mere metaphors for that which lies within. As a result, all of the major characters changed dramatically over the course of seven seasons.A second great theme of the show is that of community. The show actually contains a bit of a lie in the famous opening words that introduced the show in the first season: it says that unto each generation a Slayer is born and that SHE ALONE possesses the strength to fight the vampires and demons. Only, that isn't at all the case on the show. In fact, Buffy becomes less, not more, effective when she becomes a loner. As Spike, an evil vampire who has killed two Slayers in the past, said at the beginning of Season Two: ""A Slayer with family and friends. That sure as hell wasn't in the brochure."" And it isn't! Says so right at the beginning of the show. The Intro should read ""She and her extensive support network"" will fight the demons. And showing that no one understands this better than Spike, in Season Four he attempts to help a demon destroy the Slayer by sowing discord among the Scoobies, as the demon fighting buddies referred to themselves (this was before Sarah Michelle Gellar's unfortunate forays into the SCOOBY DOO movies). He fails when the four key members respond by forging a stronger bond than ever.Over the seven seasons, Buffy struggles constantly against her destiny, initially fighting and resisting it, gradually accepting it, frequently resenting it, and eventually embracing it before the magnificent resolution in the final episode. While there is always only one Slayer (though on Buffy, there are two, but that is a different though very interesting story), there are always many potential Slayers. In the final episode of the series, Buffy realizes how they can make all the potential Slayers into actual Slayers, and after they do so they are able to defeat the baddies and save the world from evil, again. In literally the last five seconds of the series, Faith, the other Slayer, asks Buffy what she's going to do now that she's no longer the only Slayer. In a beautiful resolution of the central tragedy in the series, a blissful, contented, expectant smile breaks out over Buffy's face. Her life has been given back to her. The expiration date has been repealed.Those who have only occasionally dipped into the show will not be able to appreciate how brilliantly written the show is. It is as if every individual writer knew every other line ever written in the show, and the result is a self-consciousness in the series that is highly unusual for TV. At the very end of Season Six, for instance, Buffy's best friend Willow utters the words, ""Bored now,"" which is not merely a reference to something she said in Season Three, but brilliantly explains where her character is at that point in the show. The scripts are, in my opinion, simply the best TV has ever seen. They are dramatic, they are believable (astonishing in a show about vampires), they are profoundly emotional, and they are funny. In fact, the show really did manage to be several things at once. I think this ability to stride several fences is one of the reasons why BUFFY, though easily the finest show on television for most of its run, never won or even received an Emmy nomination for Best Show. Should it have been nominated as Best Drama or Best Comedy? (The complete neglect by the extraordinarily conservative Emmys of BUFFY has inspired Salon to create a new TV award, the Buffy, for the most unjustly neglected show on TV, with THE WIRE as the first recipient.)The writing really was the key. I don't want to imply that other things weren't done as well. Though not one of the great casts in TV history, all of the actors did a great job and there were some truly memorable characters, from Buffy to Willow, Xander, Spike, Giles, Cordy, Anya, and Angel (who went on to star in his own spin off). The sets were always first rate and it was one of the few shows on TV to have its own utterly unique look, merely from the lighting and camerawork. Speaking of camerawork, few TV shows have ever taken so much care with the way scenes were shot. There was even their own unique blend of camp. For instance, fighting vampires is tough work, but Buffy inevitably went on patrol wearing some incredibly stylish outfits. My favorite is when she goes to the graveyard in Season Six wearing an ankle length white cashmere duster. I'm sure anyone about to engage in physical combat would decide to wear such an expensive and delicate item. But as good as all of these elements were, it all came in the end back to the writing. The show was brilliantly written on multiple levels. Many of the episodes were astonishingly good, but within them the individual lines were simply astonishing. I have many shows that I love, but in the history of television there are only two that contains dozens of lines that I can recall with ease: MONTY PYTHON and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. But apart from the individual episodes and the huge panoply of memorable lines, the seasons were almost always well conceived and executed. And even when individual seasons contained flaws in their, such as Seasons 4 and 7, these were more than made up for by the way they all fit into a larger story.In the end, no series that I know of had a better story to tell than BUFFY. As much as I loved THE X-FILES, the series was always better on the individual episode level than it was as a whole. Lone episodes of THE X-FILES are as good as any in the history of TV, but the deep back story by the end of the series ended up being more than a little muddled and incomplete. When BUFFY ended, there was a single brilliant and marvelously develop tale of a young girl who was forced to give up her life for the greater good, but who in the end managed to get her life back again. I honestly believe that BUFFY will be the gold standard for television shows in the future. It has raised the bar for what can be done and should be done on television, so in the end Buffy might not have saved the world from the powers of evil; she just might have saved television as well.",5,"In my opinion, the finest series in the history of TV",1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,8521,"['Most', 'serious', 'fans', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'already', 'own', 'individual', 'sets',

I could continue on and on, but putting the searing sadness of my feelings into the act of writing in regards to this show is impossible. This is simply because there are no words objectifiable enough to describe the nature of my being when one talks, thinks, reads, or watches this show. Perhaps, it is deep nostalgia, since the show has ended its run two years ago and we are forever left with introspection, contemplation and in some cases, the never ending fluidity of fanfic storytelling and the ultimate question, ""What if?"". Or perhaps you could say that these deep feelings are mere exaggerated by a devoted fan's withdrawing conditions: of wanting more, and wanting it forever. However, we can rule this option out because I was glad that the show ended at that point. It was beyond torturous of seeing it constantly being destroyed by apathy, carelessness or plain horrible writing. Nevertheless, these feelings are as deep to a point that I have overlooked that aforementioned abomination along time ago. And from a logical standpoint, that is something that should be left unforgiven by my beating heart. But it is not.Now I know why: ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" greatly enhanced and defined my life during high school. Every Tuesday (beginning from the middle of Season Two), it spoke to me in great volumes. It said that it was perfectly okay to be a misfit e.g. nerd, geek, gay, etc., and in most cases, there was nothing to be ashamed of in being a misfit and whatnot and, in fact, I was supposed to be celebrating the very nature of it, because at the end of the day, none of the labels that were being used to define me was going to matter, so long as I've fought a good battle and had survived (or in the case of this show, had died). Well, the fact that I'd written this down is a testimonial that, indeed, I had prevailed.The communication that I had with ""Buffy"" proved that through the combination of fantastic storytelling; very sharp wit; respect for both its characters and audiences; seemingly simple but upon examination profound themes such as friendship, relationship, individuality, the community as a whole, anarchy, the blurred lines between heroism and villainy, etc., a television show can work wonders; and wonders that eclipse time, space, and even the confinements of the cramped television screenSuffice to say, this boxset is a celebration of the amazing, the strange, the heartbreaking and the profound.

869258,A2XNCENSDIHKJR,B0006IO778,Sci Fi Lover,"[3, 4]","Season 1 wasn't really good and thankfully lasted only 13 episodes.  It was just odd how quickly the ""scooby gang"" was formed and they were very casual about killing vampires and demons from the beginning.  I also wasn't very fond of their silly dialogue either.  And if they were supposed to relate to real teen issues I don't think they did a very good job.But stick through Season 1 and you move on to the good stuff.  The relationship between Buffy and Angel is very interesting and full of surprises.  The scooby gang becomes closer and more efficient at killing and/or stopping various vampires and demons.  You'll watch Buffy and the gang grow up and go through numerous trials and tribulations...with all the ups and downs.  I personally relate to them more once they enter into the college years and her first year in college was maybe the best season of the whole series.Later on they introduced a sister into the series.  And though I like the idea of her...the actress (Michelle Trachenburg) has a very annoying voice.  It was almost impossible to like her because of her high pitched whine...and all her character did was whine...it was really distracting from her purpose in the show.Season 6 was also really hard to get through.  If I was watching it on regular TV I'm not sure if I would have tuned back in for the last year.  Buffy was going through some major changes in this year and while I can sympathize with that she became someone that I didn't like AT ALL.  She was so disconnected for the entire year and it was really too long.  Maybe half the season would have been O.K. but when you are to the point of disliking the main character it's too much.  Luckily things turned around right at the end of the season and of course the last season was really good.The relationship between Buffy and Spike was ever changing and evolving.  You found yourself rooting for them and then hoping that they never see each other again.  It's a real roller coaster ride of a relationship. Spike may have been the most dynamic character of the whole show.  I also felt sorry for him because he was so beat up (literally) during the show that I highly doubt that any demon/vampire could have lived through what he did.What I liked most about this show is right when you think you have it all figured out...it takes a turn and leaves you somewhere completely unexpected!  I was always surprised with each season.  With that I will have to say that I never got a real connection between Buffy and Willow.  It seemed like they were both close to Xander but never really to each other.The packaging of this collection is a joke.  It's just the individual FULL SCREEN (not wide screen) seasons shoved into a card board box.  The special features aren't too special and I can't see the difference between this ""boxed set"" and buying the seasons individually.All in all give this series a try.  Even though it deals with vampires and demon this show isn't going to give you nightmares.  It's drama, comedy, and a touch of horror all in one.  It was a fun journey and I'm glad I took it even if it wasn't perfect...but then again nothing is.",4,5 out of 7 seasons were good to great!!!,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,3141,"['Season', '1', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'thankfully', 'lasted', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'was', 'just', 'odd', 'how', 'quickly', 'scooby', 'gang', 'was', 'formed', 'were', 'very', 'casual', 'killing', 'vampires', 'demons', 'beginning', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'fond', 'silly', 'dialogue', 'were', 'supposed', 'relate', 'real', 'teen', 'issues', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job.But', 'stick', 'Season', '1', 'move', 'good', 'stuff', 'relationship', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'very', 'interesting', 'full', 'surprises', 'scooby', 'gang', 'closer', 'more', 'efficient', 'killing', 'and/or', 'stopping', 'various', 'vampires', 'demons', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'Buffy', 'gang', 'grow', 'up', 'go', 'numerous', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'ups', 'downs', 'personally', 'relate', 'more', 'once', 'enter', 'college', 'years', 'first', 'year', 'college', 'was', 'maybe', 'best', 'season', 'whole', 'series.Later', 'introduced', 'sister', 'series', 'like', 'idea', 'actress', 'Michelle', 'Trachenburg', 'very', 'annoying', 'voice', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'like', 'high', 'pitched', 'whine', 'character', 'did', 'was', 'whine', 'was', 'really', 'distracting', 'purpose', 'show.Season', '6', 'was', 'also', 'really', 'hard', 'get', 'was', 'watching', 'regular', 'TV', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'tuned', 'back', 'last', 'year', 'Buffy', 'was', 'going', 'major', 'changes', 'year', 'can', 'sympathize', 'became', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'AT', 'ALL', 'was', 'so', 'disconnected', 'entire', 'year', 'was', 'really', 'too', 'long', 'Maybe', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'O.K', 'when', 'are', 'point', 'disliking', 'main', 'character', 'too', 'much', 'Luckily', 'things', 'turned', 'around', 'right', 'end', 'season', 'course', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'good.The', 'relationship', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'was', 'ever', 'changing', 'evolving', 'found', 'rooting', 'then', 'hoping', 'never', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'real', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'relationship', 'Spike', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'dynamic', 'character', 'whole', 'show', 'also', 'felt', 'sorry', 'was', 'so', 'beat', 'up', 'literally', 'show', 'highly', 'doubt', 'demon/vampire', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'what', 'liked', 'most', 'show', 'right', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'turn', 'somewhere', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'was', 'always', 'surprised', 'season', 'will', 'have', 'say', 'never', 'got', 'real', 'connection', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'seemed', 'were', 'close', 'Xander', 'never', 'really', 'other.The', 'packaging', 'collection', 'joke', 'just', 'individual', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'not', 'wide', 'screen', 'seasons', 'shoved', 'card', 'board', 'box', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'special', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'difference', 'boxed', 'set', 'buying', 'seasons', 'individually.All', 'give', 'series', 'try', 'Even', 'vampires', 'demon', 'show', ""n't"", 'going', 'give', 'nightmares', 'drama', 'comedy', 'touch', 'horror', 'one', 'was', 'fun', 'journey', ""'m"", 'glad', 'took', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'then', 'again', 'nothing']",N/A

Fortunately, this collection deserves high marks on all those points.First of all, if you are already a Buffy fan, you probably already have favorite seasons and have bought them as individual sets. For those of us who are a bit less rabid and have waited to buy, this is a perfect way to get all the episodes at a bargain price. And while some seasons and episodes are better than others, there are no complete turkeys in the seven seasons of the Buffy series. Each stands well on its own with different highlights and story types. The writing on Buffy will make anyone who gives the show a chance into a fan. The villains may look cheesy but you'll forget about that once you're engaged by the dialog and character development.The packaging for these discs is well-designed and compact. The height of the package is the same as a standard DVD case with the discs stacked on top of each other in 7 separate holders. The only problem is that the clear tape holding the plastic disc holders together in each cardboard sleeve for each season isn't very strong and the holders can become detached.The only factor which I was disappointed in was the extras and commentary. There is commentary on only select episodes and a lot of the extras repeat the content of other extras. While I'm sure that Joss Whedon shot the interviews and did the commentary years apart, those who buy this set may hear them all at the same time so the repetition makes some of the extras appear like thoughtless filler. The commentary by other writers is often very tedious and banal. Many of them seem unclear on the concept of what commentary is for. They offer such insights as how ""pretty"" actors look and comment casually on the storylines refusing to give insightful information about the background or making of the show for fear of ""spoiling"" viewers' experience. Someone should have filled them in on the fact that no one buys a season of any series on DVD without already having seen it all 98% of the time and no one ever listens to commentary before watching the episodes.Considering the low price of this set (and the fact that the series itself is the main reason for buying the set, not the extras or packaging), the weak points are of little consequence when deciding whether or not to purchase this item.",5,Great value for the price,1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,2429,"['are', 'several', 'points', 'review', 'collection', 'large', 'content', 'discs', 'packaging', 'price', 'Fortunately', 'collection', 'high', 'marks', 'points.First', 'are', 'already', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'have', 'bought', 'individual', 'sets', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'less', 'rabid', 'have', 'waited', 'buy', 'perfect', 'way', 'get', 'episodes', 'bargain', 'price', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'are', 'complete', 'turkeys', 'seven', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'series', 'well', 'own', 'different', 'highlights', 'story', 'types', 'writing', 'Buffy', 'will', 'make', 'anyone', 'who', 'show', 'chance', 'fan', 'villains', 'may', 'look', 'cheesy', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'once', ""'re"", 'engaged', 'dialog', 'character', 'development.The', 'packaging', 'discs', 'well-designed', 'compact', 'height', 'package', 'same', 'standard', 'DVD', 'case', 'discs', 'stacked', 'top', 'other', '7', 'separate', 'holders', 'only', 'problem', 'clear', 'tape', 'holding', 'plastic', 'disc', 'holders', 'together', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'season', ""n't"", 'very', 'strong', 'holders', 'can', 'become', 'detached.The', 'only', 'factor', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'extras', 'commentary', 'commentary', 'only', 'select', 'episodes', 'lot', 'extras', 'repeat', 'content', 'other', 'extras', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'shot', 'interviews', 'did', 'commentary', 'years', 'apart', 'who', 'buy', 'set', 'may', 'hear', 'same', 'time', 'repetition', 'extras', 'appear', 'thoughtless', 'filler', 'commentary', 'other', 'writers', 'often', 'very', 'tedious', 'banal', 'Many', 'seem', 'unclear', 'concept', 'what', 'commentary', 'offer', 'such', 'insights', 'how', 'pretty', 'actors', 'look', 'comment', 'casually', 'storylines', 'refusing', 'give', 'insightful', 'information', 'background', 'making', 'show', 'fear', 'spoiling', 'viewers', 'experience', 'Someone', 'should', 'have', 'filled', 'fact', 'one', 'season', 'series', 'DVD', 'already', 'having', 'seen', '98', '%', 'time', 'one', 'ever', 'commentary', 'watching', 'episodes.Considering', 'low', 'price', 'set', 'fact', 'series', 'main', 'reason', 'buying', 'set', 'not', 'extras', 'packaging', 'weak', 'points', 'are', 'little', 'consequence', 'when', 'deciding', 'not', 'purchase', 'item']",N/A

869264,AIT3L2OSJNPZ6,B0006IO778,"snoogins4life ""brokenone""","[0, 0]","You see her standing there.  A petite little thing, with long sandy blond hair and a pretty face with what seems like a blank expression.  Standing there in her GAP clothes and designer boots chewing gum with a pretty little purse to accessorize; and you think...LUNCH. Well, if your a vampire.  Then, you walk up to her and she delivers a perfectly centered doubled back roundhouse kick with a springboard back handspring jawbone kick, while also pulling a large piece of wood from her previously unmenacing purse, and shoving it into your cold non beating heart; and before she finishes this all; with perfect grace of course; she throws a ditzy yet snappy one liner at you that you just comprehend before you ""poof"" out of existence into a pile of dust.That is the simple yet AMAZING premise of genius galore Joss Whedon's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", a pop culture phenomenon, a rip roaring comedy/action/drama/fantasy/horror/etc. of a show that in SO many ways changed my life and saved it as well.The set that we have here is quite simply one of if not the best Complete Series you could ever own.  Sure, maybe it doesn't have as many director's cut episodes as some box sets, or commentaries, or featurettes, or this or that or the other, but what it does have is heart. Lots of heart.From SEASON ONE'S simply yet expertly crafted introduction to the world of our slayer and the rules of her world.  With her meeting her new ""Watcher"" or the trained adult who guides and trains her in her various slayer duties, to her schoolmates falling into and permanently becoming a part of her world.  We meet Willow, Xander, Giles, Cordelia and Angel; all characters we will grow to love in so many ways over 7 years. We discover Buffy's destiny and her struggle with it, and her coping with a forbidden love with a vampire with a soul.We see them grow in SEASON'S TWO and THREE as they go from high school fledglings and reluctant slayer and hopeful partners to core school peeps, full time slayer and ""The Scooby Gang"".  We watch Buffy continue to struggle with her love for a soul filled vampire even as his soul is taken from him and he begins to torture her friends and family. We see love begin to blossom with Willow and new boo Oz, who hides a monster of his own inside. See sparks fly between other members of the gang and the addition of another slayer named Faith who turns Buffy world upside down.SEASON FOUR takes all that youthful high school safety away and brings Buffy and The Scoobies into the real world with College and a new threat and a new group of friends.  Anya, and Tara are introduced and so with these additions do two very important relationships in the ""Verse"".SEASON FIVE brings us to my main point, how the show changed and saved my life.  This season deals with death, in every way, death of a loved one, death of youthful freedom, death of security and even the deaths of relationships metaphorically.  With the death of a major side character Joss proves that death, even in Buffy's world isn't always a question of stake or be staked.  There's not always a demon or monster to slay for a person's death.  ""The Body"", my favorite Buffy episode, is a crippling display of exactly what it's like to go through the death of a major loved one; meaning father, mother, brother, sister, grandparent, child.  I lived through the exact situation.  The walking in and seeing the body just lying there, the sudden nauseua, the inability to understand why the entire world hasn't stopped when you feel like your dying inside.  I lost my father when I was 21 and it is the most devastating thing to ever happen to me.  Joss's understanding of this subject, and the ability to watch this episode has helped me in so many ways. This season also brings us a major line up change as one recurring character; a blond vamp with a thing for Buffy named Spike joins the cast full time, and Buffy gets a sister named Dawn? Huh? What? Just watch.SEASON SIX brings us into the harsh reality of the working man's world.  The Scoobie's gotta get jobs to pay bills, Buffy is having a hard time dealing with life after the happenings of SEASON FIVE and so alot of things come to light in this season.  This also contains the BEST funny episode EVER with the musical episode ""Once More With Feeling"".  And the season finale? WOW! now that's how you turn a show on it's head.SEASON SEVEN brings us full circle as girls all around the world who have the potential to one day be the slayer a meeting a nasty demise, and its up Buffy and the gang to find out why.  This season puts all the various series spanning story arcs to rest; opens a few new ones and brings the show back to its core.  A small girl/woman with the power to kick evils butt, and the small group of friends who will die to help her.This is a show for the ages, this is not just entertainment, this is therapy, this is life with a twist put on film, and I thank Joss everyday for giving it to us.  You slayed me Buffy and I'll be slayed by you till the day I die.",5,She Saved MY World...Alot,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,5033,"['see', 'standing', 'there', 'A', 'petite', 'little', 'thing',

Watch the seasons in order (don't start at season 3 like the review instructs above).  Season 1 is a great introduction to the ""Buffyverse"" and you will be hooked.  If you start at Season 3, then you have missed season 2 and the entire key relationship between Buffy and Angel (her first love).

Once I started, well, I didn't want to stop.I previously owned the season 1 set and while it was a nice set, it was misidentified in numerous places as having more than the original (first season) group of episodes (roughly half a season worth).

I would recommend this show to anyone between the ages of 15-30, you'll find that, once you get past some of the silly moments of the show, a lot of the things that Buffy and her team (the Scooby gang) go through are a lot like you went through in high school (minus the vampires and monsters of course), and further on into your early twenties.Buffy the Vampire Slayer centers around four main characters in the first season: Buffy Summers (played by the luscious Sarah Michelle Gellar), the former high school cheerleader turned reluctant vampire slayer; Willow Rosenberg (played quirkily by Alyson Hannigan of American Pie fame), the smart, cute, girl-next-door; Xander Harris (played by Nicholas Brendon), the wisecracking, everyday guy; and Rupert Giles (played by Anthony Stewart Head), the watcher (vampire slayer mentor) turned reluctant school librarian.  For those who didn't watch the movie, a few scenes in ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" might confuse you (it's really better to sit through the movie first, no matter how silly you might think it is), but you get past that pretty quickly, as you'll notice that Buffy is a lot like everyone in high school: insecure, nervous, and still deciding what she wants to do with her life.  Her friends Willow and Xander (who are introduced almost immediately) help her get accustomed to life in Sunnydale, CA, (not exactly your run-of-the-mill small town).  Giles meets Buffy in the first ten minutes of the first episode, he is her replacement watcher (I won't give away the reason), a stereotypical English gentleman, who has an extensive library of books on the occult.Season Synopsis:First season of Buffy is a must see for those unfamiliar with the show, as it gets you in tune with the Buffy-verse; season two is more story-oriented, and in my opinion, when Buffy really starts to find herself; season three, was my favorite, as it's the end of high school, and Faith (played by the gorgeous Eliza Dushku) is introduced; season four, Buffy and Willow go to college; season five, Buffy drops out, and a new character is introduced; season six, evil Willow, and the three; and season seven, the end of the show.Whether you like sci-fi, drama, comedy, or suspense, Buffy is for you.

869276,A1997C46112EKH,B0006IO778,Tiffany Bell,"[6, 8]","So, before I got this, I had never seen a single episode. I had just recently picked up Firefly and loved that. I also really enjoyed the Astonishing X-Men comic as well. So, I asked around a bit to see if this box set would be worth it--after already buying it as a Gold Box Deal. Good thing for me, everyone said I'd find it entertaining even if I didn't completely love it.I can't speak for the entire series, since I've only watched the first season thus far--but, it reminds me a lot of Smallville... with vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. And, I assume just like Smallville, this will change from the 'freak of the week' into something more. I have high hopes.I can, however, speak on the production quality of the box set itself. The box is a heavy carboard. The top of the box flips backward and the front comes forward, and has some text on it. On top, you get a letter from Joss Whedon, a DVD with extras, and a quarter-inch book with a listing of each episode. In the front, it even has the list of Joss' favorite episodes and a brief description of why.Beneath that, you have the actual DVDs. Each season comes in a 5.5x5 box that's much like a box. Each DVD has it's own ""page"" of hard plastic so you can flip to the DVD you want without having to remove the first DVD to get to the second one (You know what I'm talking about if you buy a lot of TV DVDs). It also keeps each DVD fairly safe, which is always a plus.

869277,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B0006IO778,titania86,"[3, 3]","Buffy the Vampire Slayer is one of my all time favorite TV shows. I started watching it when I was 11 and watched almost the entire show in its first run. (I missed the last season when I started college.) Now, I'm rewatching the entire thing and, as an adult, I can truly appreciate how good this show is and how it shaped my fragile little mind at a young age. It's about a girl who is called to fight the vampires and demons and stop the world from ending time and time again, but it's also about so much more.In any other movie or TV show, Buffy would be a hapless victim of a supernatural creature that would die within the first 5 minutes and Xander Harris would be the badass vampire slayer, rescuing damsels in distress. This basic horror convention is refuted time and time again. Xander never has any sort of magical powers or supernatural abilities because to do so would undermine the entire concept of the show. He does contribute to the group, but he largely stays the same as his best friend Willow becomes a powerful witch and Buffy grows in power as the Slayer. I never recognized that it was odd for Buffy to be the heroine of the show until I watched the series as an adult and saw a big, strong jock ask diminutive Buffy to walk him home. I love that Joss Whedon's idea for the show was to take a girl most would believe to be insignificant and make her extraordinary.Other than her supernatural powers, Buffy is a normal girl who still goes through most of what other teens do. Her emotions and femininity don't disappear just because she's strong and powerful. She tries to find love and her place in the world beyond slaying. Her experiences are slightly different because of the supernatural nature of the show. It may be ham handed at times, but the parallels to Buffy's experiences in her supernatural world parallel real life experiences of young adult girls. She loses her virginity to Angel and he turns into a sadistic monster, reflecting the real life experience (and her later college experience) of a guy treating a girl like dirt after sex. These metaphors are sprinkled throughout the show and really resonated with me as a kid as well as now. Buffy has other life experiences that aren't veiled in any sort of metaphor, such as her mother dying.The Body is one of the best episodes on the show and even ever on TV. This is one of the many instances when Buffy with all her Slayer powers can only sit by and do nothing. Each of the characters deal with Joyce's death in their own way and represent the different stages of the grieving process. This episode never fails to bring tears to my eyes, especially Anya's speech, which relates her childlike inability to grasp death and how to act in such a situation. The entire look and flow of the episode is completely different to reflect what goes on in Buffy's mind as she grieves: her fantasies of saving her mother, her perceived meaning behind the doctor's words, her view of the EMT as he explains to her what happened to her mom. One of the most jarring things about this episode is that there is absolutely no music. It makes the episode feel stark and the viewer is unable to escape the grief and pain. I can't watch this episode without crying. Each of the characters' performances are exceptional, especially Anya and Willow. This is only one of a long list of awesome episodes (Hush, Once More with Feeling, Fool for Love, Passion, etc.)Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a great horror show that deals with heavy life subjects, but also has quirky, sarcastic humor laced into every episode. Although the first season is kind of painful to watch, it becomes a good and enjoyable show rather quickly. Each season is unique and the characters change in surprising ways over the seven seasons (and the eighth season in comic book form). This show is timeless thanks to the writing and the wonderful cast.

869279,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B0006IO778,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[194, 256]","What can really be said about ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" that hasn't already been said.  In every form of production this series was a miracle: after leaving Buffy for death after the desasterous 1992 feature film, writter Joss Whedon took his original idea and tranformed it into television form.  But it was only the upstart network: The WB that would give Joss and company a chance.  It was from there in March of 1997 that Buffy was born.  Eventhough the show was ""officially"" cancelled 6 times durring its run the show lasted seven years filming 144 episodes.To sum up the story of Buffy is extremly difficult, especially when you don't have the amount of space a book offers to do so.  In the simplest of forms Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a story about outsiders, true love, and family.  Buffy is a typical blond southern californian girl: superficial, peppy, and niave.  It isn't until that she finds out that she is actually the lastest in a long line of women chosen to fight vampires and the forces of darkness.  That secrest forcess Buffy to grow up rather fast, especially when she and her mother relocate to Sunnydale, California. It was there that Buffy truly began her journey.  But she was a unique slayer in fact that she had friends by her side that saved her life more times than anyone can count... overtime these friends became her family, and the core to the show.The best was to write about the complete series is to do so in a season by seaosn basis.  Season 1 (which lasted on 12 episodes) basically series as an introduction to the series.  The characters are introduced, and fleshed out... it is amazing that it only takes the show 12 episodes to establish seven character that seem like they become part of the family by the episode ""Prophecy Girl"".  But the first season also serves as an introduction to the universe the show is set in.  Sunnydale (the town buffy lives in) serves as a ""hellmouth"" of sorst which means that it has alot of mystical energy that draws ""the forces of darkness to it.""Season Two served the show, by demonstrated what the series was capable off.  Buffy will not always be a fluffly happy show, and in times can become rather depressing... Anything goes, like real life: hearts can be broken, people can die, the world will go on.  It is in this season that Buffy learns all these major lessons....Season Three tells the story of ending... and how to deal with them... There are only a few amount of people that you can count on... This is learned when the Mayor of Sunnydale becomes the #1 bad guy, trying to asscend and rid the world of humans.  This season also shows that friends can become family, family is not just blood, its who you choose.Season Four was all about the growing up.  When Buffy and company go off to college, they learn that there are many things that can pull them apart, but it is who you trust that is ultimatly important...And so on... each season's basic focus is about the growing trends and how people eventually become who there are, and what influences... how people are torn apart, and brought together.  How Family doesn't just have to be blood, but can be found...I have only just scratched the surface of this amazing show that digged so deep down that is has become the sole focus of numerous college courses.  Joss Whedon and his writters developed a world that is full of so many themes (universal and specific) that it can charm anyone of any age (while at the same time making them laugh, cry, and want to throw up with pain).I personally started watching the show when I was 9 years old from the very first episode.  I continued on with the show until the series finale when I was 15 (I also followed the series Angel)... And the show still seemes so fresh in my mind.  Eventhough I have seem the ""highschool episodes"" many many times, I still find that there is more and more to discover in this universe... The best way I can describe this show is magically.When I started watching Buffy, it was the only tv show that I watched (besides teh simpsons), it was from there that I branched out into other shows: dawson's creek, chamred, felicity, gilmore girls, and so on... but no matter how many shows I watched I could not find anything to match the wit and magic that I originally found in Buffy.  When I first bought the first season on DVD years ago, I remember listening to the commentary for ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""the Harvest"" by the series creator: Joss Whedon (the commentaries are included on this set).  It was in this commentary that Joss Talked about everything from the movie to getting the show to last into its fifth season... He talked about the show and the process of making the show with so much compassion and love and drive it really touched me... I believe that the commentary is the soul purpose that influenced me to become a television writer... It is less than 2 months before I start college, and I believe that there would be no more perfect time for this set to come out.If you have ever put off buying this series, this is your chance to own

No, the purpose of my comments here are to drive a stake through the heart of Joss Whedon for refusing to issue seasons 4 through 7 in their ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO. That's RIGHT - THOSE BTVS seasons were shot in WIDESCREEN, which for my money is the PREFERRED way to watch them. In its Region 2 and Region 4 releases, season 4 was the first season of Buffy to be presented on disc in 1.78:1 widescreen. I think it's fair to say that the suits at TCFHE suspected that having the episodes presented letterboxed in the States might cause the demographic which isn't sophisticated enough to understand widescreen to complain and return them. I actually have no problem having ""full-frame"" editions available - but for those fans who own widescreen tvs or have no problem with them black bars, we are NOT given a choice. Buffy just looks BETTER in widescreen. ANYONE with an eye for photographic composition should be able to recognize THAT. If Whedon was smart, he'd offer up the widescreen editions through a website, or SOMETHING, to make more MONEY (HINT! HINT!!).

869289,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0006IO778,Z Hayes,"[6, 6]","Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the series remains one of my favorite paranormal television series, ever. I received this as a gift not too long ago, and have been re-watching the seasons these past couple of weeks. The show has everything going for it - an ensemble cast of talented actors (especially the spunky and determined Sarah Michelle Gellar as the eponymous heroine), riveting plots, high-paced action sequences, all sorts of dark creatures (and great make-up effects that have withstood the test of time), witty dialogue, and just pure fun!In this day and age where insipid reality shows dominate prime time television, BTVS is a breath of fresh air, despite being more than a decade old. This collector's set contains the full series, i.e. Seasons 1-7. From its beginnings as a mainly for teens-only supernatural show, the show grows from strength to strength. In Season 1, Buffy reluctantly assumes the mantle of vampire-slayer (and she does slay other demons as well) under the guidance of Watcher Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head). The only friends she has are super smart, nerdy Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and girl-crazy, average guy Xander (Nicholas Brendon). Things become even more complicated when Buffy falls fast and hard for Angel (David Boreanaz), a formerly vicious and evil vampire who has had his soul restored.The following seasons follow Buffy and her friends and loves as they battle the forces of darkness. The characters all evolve throughout the seasons - Willow falls in love, matures, and finds her talent for the Craft, becoming a powerful witch; Xander is no longer just a comic relief - he too matures, experiences multiple heartaches, and finds his own niche; and of course Buffy - from a lonely teen who falls for the wrong 'guy', she discovers being strong is not confined to merely killing vampires and demons but overcoming her own inner flaws and discovering herself. Season 3 was one of the best in the series in my opinion as the characters are all shown to have their strengths and flaws - duplicity amongst the friends, harboring dark secrets, etc. One of my favorite episodes in Season 3 was ""Revelations"" as the characters have to deal with their frustrations/ anger/ prejudices, etc. Season 4 was also compelling in terms of plot and characterizations. My favorite seasons were Seasons 1-4, though seasons 5-7 were good as well.
