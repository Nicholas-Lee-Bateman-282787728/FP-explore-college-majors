453117,AAPWD1KRDMQHA,6305177341,"""ann_septimus16""","[124, 126]","In 1997 there were two movies made about English children who take pictures of fairies.  One, Fairy Tale: A True Story, was released to wide audiences and charmed many as an intelligent kid's flick.  This story was based on fact, hence the subtitle.  The other, Photographing Fairies, was only selectively released on video here in the States, aimed at an adult audience.  It deals with a fictional reimagining of the Cottingley fairy incident portrayed in Fairy Tale, as seen through the cynical eyes of a photographer bent on proving the girls false.  Charles Castle, spiritually wounded by the death of his bride, tries to disprove the pictures using logic and a camera, but soon finds that there is more to the story than he had bargained on.Although I was charmed by Fairy Tale, Photographing Fairies is the movie that holds a special place in my heart.  I have watched it more times than I can count, and still manage to be surprised and touched by this haunting film.  This is everything that is good about high-quality cinema - good acting, interesting story, FANTASTIC soundtrack (which doesn't seem to exist on CD!), and an intelligent look at some rather surprising philosophical questions; also the special effects beat anything in Fairy Tale.The Acting:  This movie was the first time I had seen the young actor Toby Stephens and I was very impressed at the restrained manner in which he chose to go about portraying a character who, in lesser hands, could very well have been bombastic or pitiful.  His take on Charles Castle radiates Humanity and feeling, helping the audience understand the unspoken dilemma of mind and heart that he faces.  My only complaint is that in many scenes the glasses that Stephens wore reflected the glare of the lights, making it difficult to see his eyes, and creating a distraction in the flow of the frame.Ben Kingsley and Emily Woof, an old war-horse and a promising actress, also help the film along with convincing parts (the father of the girls and the governess, respectively).  Although both of them are not given much to do, dramatically speaking, they too manage to bring a sense of realism to their roles.The supporting characters, including the girls who's pictures are the catalyst for the action, are also drawn to perfection.The Story:  Although supposedly based on the book of the same name by Steven Szylagi, there are only superficial resemblances.  The movie has more of a spiritual base, borrowing only a few names, settings, and narcotic flowers from the book and leaving most of the subplots and devices out.The Music:  Absolutely beautiful.  The main theme is played as everything from a dance tune to a funeral dirge, and is almost guarenteed to get stuck in your head for days afterward.  The score is very haunting and adds that extra ethereal touch to the total effect of the movie.  Also, one side note: the 'death song' is a part of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, and has been recorded by Sarah Brightman as Figlio Perduto, but seems to be unlisted on the credits...When one watches a movie that has definite religious undertones, one often feels the pressure coming from one side or another, belief-wise.  Part of what I love about Photographing Fairies is that it makes none of those distinctions.  The preacher-father seems to be the pastor for some imaginary church, and the heaven ideas can be adapted to suit almost any taste. &quot;What if heaven were as real a place as Claxton on the Sea?&quot;The real reason that this movie has sat with me for so long, and the reason that I keep returning to it, is another theme running through it.  That of learning from love/to love.  Linda, the governess, falls for Charles Castle, but Castle refuses here because of his love for his dead wife.  Instead of persuing this man, Linda learns from him and sets her sights on &quot;the man who'll love me as much as he loves her&quot;.  In this age of inevitable cinematic love, this is a refreshing treat and a much more poignant result than another retread of &quot;wounded man is revived by beautiful ingenue&quot;.All in all, Photographing Fairies is a very affecting movie, no matter what your philosophical/religious beliefs are.  Give this one a chance and it will surprise you, haunt you, move you.Ishka Bibl!",5,Beautiful in every way,996278400,"07 28, 2001",2001,4285,"['1997', 'were', 'two', 'movies', 'made', 'English', 'children', 'who', 'take', 'pictures', 'fairies', 'One', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'True', 'Story', 'was', 'released', 'wide', 'audiences', 'charmed', 'many', 'intelligent', 'kid', 'flick', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'fact', 'hence', 'subtitle', 'other', 'Photographing', 'Fairies', 'was', 'only', 'selectively', 'released', 'video', 'here', 'States', 'aimed', 'adult', 'audience', 'fictional', 'reimagining', 'Cottingley', 'fairy', 'incident', 'portrayed', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'seen', 'cynical', 'eyes', 'photographer', 'bent', 'proving', 'girls', 'false', 'Charles', 'Castle', 'spiritually', 'wounded', 'death', 'bride', 'tries', 'disprove', 'pictures', 'using', 'logic', 'camera', 'soon', 'more', 'story', 'had', 'bargained', 'was', 'charmed', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'Photographing', 'Fairies', 'movie', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'have', 'watched', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'still', 'manage', 'be', 'surprised', 'touched', 'haunting', 'film', 'everything', 'good', 'high-quality', 'cinema', 'good', 'acting', 'interesting', 'story', 'FANTASTIC', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'seem', 'exist', 'CD', 'intelligent', 'look', 'rather', 'surprising', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'also', 'special', 'effects', 'beat', 'anything', 'Fairy', 'Tale.The', 'Acting', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'young', 'actor', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'restrained', 'manner', 'chose', 'go', 'portraying', 'character', 'who', 'lesser', 'hands', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'bombastic', 'pitiful', 'take', 'Charles', 'Castle', 'Humanity', 'feeling', 'helping', 'audience', 'understand', 'unspoken', 'dilemma', 'mind', 'heart', 'only', 'complaint', 'many', 'scenes', 'glasses', 'wore', 'reflected', 'glare', 'lights', 'making', 'difficult', 'see', 'eyes', 'creating', 'distraction', 'flow', 'frame.Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Emily', 'Woof', 'old', 'war-horse', 'promising', 'actress', 'also', 'help', 'film', 'convincing', 'parts', 'father', 'girls', 'governess', 'respectively', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'dramatically', 'speaking', 'too', 'manage', 'bring', 'sense', 'realism', 'roles.The', 'supporting', 'characters', 'including', 'girls', 'who', 'pictures', 'are', 'catalyst', 'action', 'are', 'also', 'drawn', 'perfection.The', 'Story', 'supposedly', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Steven', 'Szylagi', 'are', 'only', 'superficial', 'resemblances', 'movie', 'more', 'spiritual', 'base', 'borrowing', 'only', 'few', 'names', 'settings', 'narcotic', 'flowers', 'book', 'leaving', 'most', 'subplots', 'devices', 'out.The', 'Music', 'Absolutely', 'beautiful', 'main', 'theme', 'played', 'everything', 'dance', 'tune', 'funeral', 'dirge', 'almost', 'guarenteed', 'get', 'stuck', 'head', 'days', 'afterward', 'score', 'very', 'haunting', 'extra', 'ethereal', 'touch', 'total', 'effect', 'movie', 'Also', 'one', 'side', 'note', ""'death"", 'song', 'part', 'Beethoven', 'Seventh', 'Symphony', 'been', 'recorded', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Figlio', 'Perduto', 'be', 'unlisted', 'credits', 'When', 'one', 'movie', 'definite', 'religious', 'undertones', 'one', 'often', 'pressure', 'coming', 'one', 'side', 'belief-wise', 'Part', 'what', 'love', 'Photographing', 'Fairies', 'none', 'distinctions', 'preacher-father', 'be', 'pastor', 'imaginary', 'church', 'heaven', 'ideas', 'can', 'be', 'adapted', 'suit', 'almost', 'taste', 'quot', 'What', 'heaven', 'were', 'real', 'place', 'Claxton', 'Sea', 'quot', 'real', 'reason', 'movie', 'sat', 'so', 'long', 'reason', 'keep', 'returning', 'theme', 'running', 'learning', 'love/to', 'love', 'Linda', 'governess', 'Charles', 'Castle', 'Castle', 'here', 'love', 'dead', 'wife', 'Instead', 'persuing', 'man', 'Linda', 'sights', 'quot', 'man', 'who', ""'ll"", 'love', 'as', 'much', 'quot', 'age', 'inevitable', 'cinematic', 'love', 'refreshing', 'treat', 'much', 'more', 'poignant', 'result', 'retread', 'quot', 'wounded', 'man', 'revived', 'beautiful', 'ingenue', 'quot', 'Photographing', 'Fairies', 'very', 'affecting', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'philosophical/religious', 'beliefs', 'are', 'Give', 'one', 'chance', 'will', 'surprise', 'haunt', 'move', 'you.Ishka', 'Bibl']",Photographing Fairies VHS
453118,AORW1FRF4D4KS,6305177341,azindn,"[7, 8]","The schism between belief and science, religion and technology, the afterlife and end of life, childhood innocence and adult reality, are all themes which flow through this marvelous film. Photographing Fairies is a deceptive title for a film that is more than a simple tale of two little girls who claimed to photograph little flying sprites in rural Birkinwell, England. During the latter quarter of the 19th century and into the 20th century, beliefs about civilization as the privilege of modern western society was shaken by the reality of modern social ills culminating with the devastation wreaked by WWI.From this groundwork, two men loose their wives: Charles Castle (Toby Stevens), a grieving, young photographer who lost his wife on their honeymoon and earns a living creating  staged memorial photographs of dead soldiers for their grieving families, and the second and far darker character, a country parson, Rev. Templeton (Ben Kingsley), whose very calling relies on humanity's ultimate desire to believe in something more, in life after death but which he has not maintained. Templeton's wife Beatrice approached Castle with the photograph offering evidence of fairies with their young daughters. Castle analyzes the image and arrives at the conclusion no trick photography was involved. He sets out to discover the ""truth"" of the image with mind-altering results.Although somewhat heavy-handed in some symbolic references to Christian beliefs, this is balanced by the notion of fairies as pre-Christian elemental beings of Nature. In addition, the use of an organic flower is key to the transition to ""slow time"" that enables whoever consumes it to see what is invisible to the naked eye of modern man, and ultimately, to technology. 19th century photography enabled audiences to possess visual evidence of the living and the dead as well as the spiritual as the trends for post-mortem and spirit photography was fashionable for the Victorians. As Castle's beliefs are replaced with new mystical experiences, Rev. Templeton is adamant to thwart any efforts that deny his beliefs and self-indulgent practices.This is a subtle storyline that belies the title and it is all for the better. Superior acting from Toby Stevenson and Ben Kingsley lift the story to a level that leaves the audience pondering several questions that become more intriguing on multiple viewings. Wonderful period costuming, locations, and soundtrack have been commented on by others and all in all, Photographing Fairies is worth the watch and is worthy of film libraries that contain lesser films about the unseen and perhaps, unknowable.",5,I See Queen Mab Has Been With You!,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,2629,"['schism', 'belief', 'science', 'religion', 'technology', 'afterlife', 'end', 'life', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'adult', 'reality', 'are', 'themes', 'flow', 'marvelous', 'film', 'Photographing', 'Fairies', 'deceptive', 'title', 'film', 'more', 'simple', 'tale', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'claimed', 'photograph', 'little', 'flying', 'sprites', 'rural', 'Birkinwell', 'England', 'latter', 'quarter', '19th', 'century', '20th', 'century', 'beliefs', 'about', 'civilization', 'privilege', 'modern', 'western', 'society', 'was', 'shaken', 'reality', 'modern', 'social', 'ills', 'culminating', 'devastation', 'wreaked', 'WWI.From', 'groundwork', 'two', 'men', 'loose', 'wives', 'Charles', 'Castle', 'Toby', 'Stevens', 'grieving', 'young', 'photographer', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'honeymoon', 'living', 'creating', 'staged', 'memorial', 'photographs', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'grieving', 'families', 'second', 'far', 'darker', 'character', 'country', 'parson', 'Rev', 'Templeton', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'very', 'calling', 'relies', 'humanity', 'ultimate', 'desire', 'believe', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'death', 'not', 'maintained', 'Templeton', 'wife', 'Beatrice', 'approached', 'Castle', 'photograph', 'offering', 'evidence', 'fairies', 'young', 'daughters', 'Castle', 'image', 'conclusion', 'trick', 'photography', 'was', 'involved', 'out', 'discover', 'truth', 'image', 'mind-altering', 'results.Although', 'somewhat', 'heavy-handed', 'symbolic', 'references', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'balanced', 'notion', 'fairies', 'pre-Christian', 'elemental', 'beings', 'Nature', 'addition', 'use', 'organic', 'flower', 'key', 'transition', 'slow', 'time', 'whoever', 'see', 'what', 'invisible', 'naked', 'eye', 'modern', 'man', 'ultimately', 'technology', '19th', 'century', 'photography', 'enabled', 'audiences', 'possess', 'visual', 'evidence', 'living', 'dead', 'as', 'well', 'spiritual', 'trends', 'post-mortem', 'spirit', 'photography', 'was', 'fashionable', 'Victorians', 'Castle', 'beliefs', 'are', 'replaced', 'new', 'mystical', 'experiences', 'Rev', 'Templeton', 'adamant', 'thwart', 'efforts', 'deny', 'beliefs', 'self-indulgent', 'practices.This', 'subtle', 'storyline', 'title', 'better', 'Superior', 'acting', 'Toby', 'Stevenson', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'story', 'level', 'audience', 'pondering', 'several', 'questions', 'become', 'more', 'intriguing', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Wonderful', 'period', 'costuming', 'locations', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'been', 'commented', 'others', 'Photographing', 'Fairies', 'watch', 'worthy', 'film', 'libraries', 'contain', 'lesser', 'films', 'unseen', 'perhaps', 'unknowable']",Photographing Fairies VHS

Erland,"[17, 17]","Note: If you live in the America's you must have a multi-region DVD player to watch this one.Introduction: `Photographing Fairies' is an obscure British film from '98 that to my knowledge was never released to American theaters. It was available in limited quantities on VHS but has yet to appear on a REGION 1 DVD.This probably shouldn't be too surprising when you look at the subject matter of the film. Unlike the Emerald Isles who have an ancient and ongoing oral and written tradition concerning the ""wee folk"", American audiences are vastly untutored in the topic of the intangible realm of the ""Secret Commonweath"" and its myriad of inhabitants. Tales of fairies, elves, undines and fauns are not something that would normally dwell in the psyche of U. S. natives. For this reason more than any other 'Photographing Fairies' remains all but unknown on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. This magical realm of existence is something unfortunately lacking in this country.Synopsis: Set in the early years of the 20th century (1917) widower Charles Castle (Toby Stephens) has come to the ultimate moment of truth in his search to discover tangible proof for the existence of the soul and life after death. Is the passage to the world beyond found within the pungent buds of a very special flower? And if so what is the role to be played by the winged guardians of these flowers and the tree upon which they grow? Are they truly connected to the realm of the dead? Mr. Castle seems to think so.Critique: `Photographing Fairies' delivers a beguiling, at times hallucinogenic vision of the rich and textured borderland between the physical, the psychic and what lies beyond. The production values are superior, the storyline well-conceived and layered with various levels of meaning and the visuals are absolutely haunting. Without a doubt this is one of my favorite films!

The story is about a young photographer named Charles Castle who looses his wife soon after they are married, and of course he is lost in his grief. He goes off to war and is employed as a photographer in the trenches, and after the war he is still consumed with death as we see him cut and paste photos of dead soldiers into new photos of their loved ones for a living. One day he finds himself at a supernatural convention of sorts and comes upon a lecture of a man telling people of the cottingly photographs and supporting the existence of faeries because of them. Charles then proceeds to interrupt the man, telling him that there is no way the photos can be real, both from a photographers perspectives and as one who has lost faith with all things the eye cannot see. The character of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle makes an appearance in the film, as he was a supporter of the photos, even though he wasn't so supportive of them in the film. So, after attending the lecture, a woman comes to his studio and shows him some photographs that were supposedly of a real faerie standing on her daughter's outstretched hand. Of course Charles doesn't believe this any more than he believed the Cottingly story, but after closer inspection he finds that there is something not quite right about the photo and goes off to find the woman and ask her about it. The woman lives in the countryside with her husband, a pastor, their two daughters, and the governess for the girls. He finds the woman and tells her that he may believe her story, but she just smiles at him and tells him that the photograph doesn't matter anymore because she has seen them. The details after this point I will not go into because that is where the real mystery lies.Charles struggles throughout the movie with his wife's death and cannot seem to get beyond the hold it has on him. Maybe because of this he has lost all faith in an after world or possibilities of another world within ours, until of course he goes in search of the faeries. When he does find a way to see them (whether or not he's hallucinating is debatable) he clings to this connection ferociously and uses this to try to get in touch with his wife. At the end he is somewhat set free of this, and embarks on an adventure of sorts.This is not a film for children, or if a child does see it, it should be monitored by a parent. There is both nudity and death in the film, and though neither appear in excess, I would say this is a 14 and up movie.",4,good,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,2606,"['Photographing', 'Fairies', 'sci', 'fi/', 'fantasy', 'film', 'set', 'early', '1900', 'exploring', 'idea', 'cottingly', 'fairy', 'hoax', 'story', 'young', 'photographer', 'named', 'Charles', 'Castle', 'who', 'wife', 'soon', 'are', 'married', 'course', 'lost', 'grief', 'war', 'employed', 'photographer', 'trenches', 'war', 'still', 'consumed', 'death', 'see', 'cut', 'paste', 'photos', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'new', 'photos', 'loved', 'ones', 'living', 'One', 'day', 'supernatural', 'convention', 'sorts', 'lecture', 'man', 'telling', 'people', 'cottingly', 'photographs', 'supporting', 'existence', 'faeries', 'Charles', 'then', 'interrupt', 'man', 'telling', 'way', 'photos', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'photographers', 'perspectives', 'one', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'things', 'eye', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'character', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'appearance', 'film', 'was', 'supporter', 'photos', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'supportive', 'film', 'So', 'attending', 'lecture', 'woman', 'studio', 'photographs', 'were', 'supposedly', 'real', 'faerie', 'standing', 'daughter', 'outstretched', 'hand', 'course', 'Charles', ""n't"", 'believe', 'more', 'believed', 'Cottingly', 'story', 'closer', 'inspection', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'photo', 'off', 'find', 'woman', 'ask', 'woman', 'countryside', 'husband', 'pastor', 'two', 'daughters', 'governess', 'girls', 'woman', 'may', 'believe', 'story', 'just', 'smiles', 'photograph', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anymore', 'seen', 'details', 'point', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'where', 'real', 'mystery', 'struggles', 'movie', 'wife', 'death', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'hold', 'Maybe', 'lost', 'faith', 'world', 'possibilities', 'world', 'ours', 'course', 'search', 'faeries', 'When', 'find', 'way', 'see', 'not', 'hallucinating', 'debatable', 'connection', 'ferociously', 'try', 'get', 'touch', 'wife', 'end', 'somewhat', 'set', 'free', 'embarks', 'adventure', 'sorts.This', 'not', 'film', 'children', 'child', 'see', 'should', 'be', 'monitored', 'parent', 'nudity', 'death', 'film', 'appear', 'excess', 'would', 'say', '14', 'up', 'movie']",Photographing Fairies VHS
453123,A2IY9M330NKBW6,6305177341,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 2]","This is inspired by the Cottingley fairy photograph case and it makes for some interesting film making.Here's the scoop. A Photographer loses his wife in a tragic accident on their honeymoon. He's distraught and heads off to WWI to photograph dead soldiers, no longer caring for his personal safety. He manages to make it through Okay and after the war he sets up a studio and also spends time detecting fraud in doctored photographs. When he sees an obviously fake photo of some fairies, he sees one shot from the set that might not be faked. He's off to check the origin of the photo and it leads to some astounding conclusions.This is an unsensational take on a sensational subject. It's handled in a fairly straightforward, dramatic fashion. He needs to see if there are fairies and if they represent another level of existence whereby he might be reunited with his deceased wife when he leaves this world. The fairies are tied, somehow, to two young girls (daughters of the local preacher) and the ingestion of a ""magic"" flower growing inside a tree where the fairies appear. Bad things happen to people during the investigation and our hero is drawn into a situation where his faith in the fairies will be put to the test.This is a very professional film. It's got a slick look to it. All the production values are of the highest level. Ben Kingsley is good as the preacher and Toby Stephens is good as the hero, Charles Castle.

453127,A106016KSI0YQ,6305177341,Jay Dickson,"[8, 10]","Two films were made at about the same time based on, of all things, the Arthur Conan Doyle scandal from the early 20s about the supposed photographing of actual fairies playing with children. FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY garnered more attention, and largely took the children's perspective; this little thriller from the same year used the tale more as a point of departure, imagining instead an adult fantasy with erotic and philosophical overtones about a photographer haunted by the death of his first wife who becomes involved in a similar incident.The film has unusual and wonderful effects that stay with you for a long time, and wish it were up to the ambitions the first-time director, Nick Willing, clearly had for it. Unfortunately, his inexperience shows, and the odd bridge he tries to naviagte between fantasy and realism doesn't always hold together. His use of expressionistic techniques--the bloodied head of the hero at the funeral, the linking image of the pocketwatch (brought out even when the hero is in a full body cast!)--just seem silly rather than evocative. The film has an unusual hero in Toby Stephens: while not very sympathetic, he's a superb actor, and his decided carnality and corporeality work startling effects on the character. Unfortunately, these same qualities makes it impossible to believe that Ben Kingsley (of all people), as a grieving country vicar, could ever get the better of Stephens so many times physically as he does in the film. Still, the ambition of the film, and its many evocative images, make you wish it were released on DVD with a director's or writer's commentary.",3,Fanciful thriller with lingering effects,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,1621,"['Two', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'based', 'things', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'scandal', 'early', '20s', 'supposed', 'photographing', 'actual', 'fairies', 'playing', 'children', 'FAIRY', 'TALE', 'TRUE', 'STORY', 'garnered', 'more', 'attention', 'largely', 'took', 'children', 'perspective', 'little', 'thriller', 'same', 'year', 'used', 'tale', 'more', 'point', 'departure', 'imagining', 'instead', 'adult', 'fantasy', 'erotic', 'philosophical', 'overtones', 'photographer', 'haunted', 'death', 'first', 'wife', 'who', 'involved', 'similar', 'incident.The', 'film', 'unusual', 'wonderful', 'effects', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'wish', 'were', 'up', 'ambitions', 'first-time', 'director', 'Nick', 'Willing', 'clearly', 'had', 'Unfortunately', 'inexperience', 'shows', 'odd', 'bridge', 'naviagte', 'fantasy', 'realism', ""n't"", 'always', 'hold', 'together', 'use', 'expressionistic', 'techniques', 'bloodied', 'head', 'hero', 'funeral', 'linking', 'image', 'pocketwatch', 'brought', 'out', 'even', 'when', 'hero', 'full', 'body', 'cast', 'just', 'seem', 'silly', 'rather', 'evocative', 'film', 'unusual', 'hero', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'not', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'superb', 'actor', 'decided', 'carnality', 'corporeality', 'work', 'startling', 'effects', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'qualities', 'impossible', 'believe', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'people', 'grieving', 'country', 'vicar', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'better', 'Stephens', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'physically', 'film', 'Still', 'ambition', 'film', 'many', 'evocative', 'images', 'make', 'wish', 'were', 'released', 'DVD', 'director', 'writer', 'commentary']",Photographing Fairies VHS

They really are only a footfall away.'It is the ensuing years after World War I, and Charles Castle (Toby Stephens) is eking out a living as a photographer in London after having spent time in the trenches of Europe, photographing dead soldiers for posterity.  Before the war, in 1912, he was married in Switzerland, but due to a mountain climbing tragedy, became a widower before the honeymoon was over.  He has become a mere shell of a man, going through the motions of everyday life, and unceasing in his wait for the day that he himself will cease to exist.  His function in this life has been to debunk the world of the supernatural and all who claim to make contact with the spirit world.At one such function, sponsored by the Theosophical Society, he lays waste to a set of photographs purporting to show two young girls with fairies dancing around them. A woman who attended the same function comes to his studio, showing photos of a different calibre -- a little girl with a fairy obscured, standing on the end of her hand.  Castle readily pooh poohs this display, and the woman leaves, satisfied and yet unfulfilled in her quest.  Before long, Castle comes to realize, through a series of experiments, that there is a great deal of truth being portrayed in that photograph, and hence, he makes it his goal to travel to Birkenwell to confront his own demons and solve the mystery of life and death as we know it.Photographing Fairies is a variation on a theme of a famous incident that happened in England in 1917 involving two young girls, Frances Griffiths and Elsie Wright of Cottingley, who claimed to have taken photographs of fairies in their garden.  These photos were seized upon by no other than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle of Sherlock Holmes fame in 1921, and bandied about as absolute proof of theosophist theories that he was attracted to.  Final proof of the girls and their duplicity was revealed in 1983, when Elsie wrote her famous confession and Frances followed suit. The article was posted in The Times.Photographing Fairies is definitely not a film for children.  It was released the same year as another film about fairies, Fairy Tale: A True Story, but is miles apart in telling a tale of fantasy and awe. While the latter asks us to believe that all we see happened as it was filmed, there is obviously a great deal of artistic license that is projected. Photographing Fairies differs for it asks us as viewers to take it or leave it as we see fit. It is a much darker story and obviously not a fairy tale with a happy ending, except in the mind of Charles Castle as he races on a course with death. It is truly a shame that this film was lost in the shuffle of Fairy Tale, for while both have their good points, Photographing Fairies has an absolute stranglehold on a story with teeth in it.Toby Stephens plays Charles Castle as an enigma, and in doing so, has provided us with an entirely convincing performance. Emily Woof as Linda, governess to the little girls, Clara and Ana Templeton (Hannah Bould and Miriam Grant) is effective in her pursuit to keep Charles in this world and not the next. The girls are etched in innocence and peace of mind and never did one get the feeling that they were witnessing 'acting' by precocious children. Ben Kingsley as Reverend Templeton provides a strange and calculated portrayal, moving from frame to frame, changing his spots like a leopard, until the final denouement between Castle and himself in the forest. Edward Hardwicke as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is simply doing what he does best; lending credence to a marvelous block of acting as has been his wont over a long and illustrious career. It's too bad that his role was so short in this film.Nick Willing and Chris Harrald have taken the novel of the same name by Steve Szilagyi and worked miracles with it. The novel was simply an armature for an interpretation that is a vast improvement on a slight undertaking by Mr. Szilagyi. The better story is provided with the film, for complexities of human nature are betrayed that never quite see the light of day in the book. Both Willing and Harrald are relative newcomers to the world of film, but if Photographing Fairies is any indication of what stuff they are made of, then a productive, creative and applause filled road is theirs to travel.The photography by John de Borman is exquisite and the English countryside, along with the Swiss Alps, have never been shown to lovelier advantage. There is an impressionistic quality to it all, as we are drawn into the fabric of the story.When it first opened, critics made a great deal out of the fact that the visuals of the fairies had none of the requisite necessities that were needed to make the viewer think that they were actually seeing the agreed upon subject. What nitpicking! They failed to understand that only a visual was pertinent to the crux of the situation, and not a high tech, state of the art blow out. The merest hint of 'it's there' was all that was needed and it was achieved in spades.Music by Simon Boswell was evocative of time and place and it shared mood duties with the death dirge of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, which is played to full effect and in compliance with Castle's life and eventual fate. If there is a dry eye to be had at the conclusion of this film, then the person they belong to, has no heart or soul.This reviewer was intrigued and swept away, into the world of make believe and what if's. The logical and yet as we know and are taught it, irrationality of the subject, melded together to present for our considerations, a well thought out and richly veined tale that stays with us long after the credits have rolled, the music has stopped and we have left the theatre. We are left with the possibilities of probabilities as we would like to think them to be. We are entreated entrance into a world of simple things and knowing souls who will guide us to another world where things will be complacent and serene, if we just believe.Photographing Fairies is that rare commodity that comes along and stays with us like a cool breeze on a summer's day, and is just as quickly gone to adjust its policies. A seed has been planted and the questions we are left with take us back to a time of innocence, longing and understanding. Is there a place, a clearing, a glen that houses such things? We can only wish...",5,If You Only Believe,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,6484,"[""'Death"", 'merely', 'change', 'state', 'soul', 'fresh', 'expression', 'self', 'dead', 'are', 'not', 'dust', 'really',

453134,AYIHIIOO7Z6P0,6305177341,Ruth Henriquez Lyon,"[4, 4]","""Photographing Fairies"" is a haunting, sad, and sometimes terrifying story about society's oppression of alternate belief systems.  The main character, Charles Castle (Toby Stephens), is a British World War I veteran who undergoes a personal tragedy at the start of the film.  His loss throws him into a bitter resistance to life.  Believing that existence has no meaning, he glumly earns a living as a photographer in London, and takes little pleasure in his business or his art.  But then, a woman  brings him a photograph she has taken of her daughter communing with a fairy.  He suspects a hoax, and assumes she has somehow altered the picture.  But an epiphany is in store for him.  After he stays up an entire night struggling, without success, to figure out how the photograph has been faked, he instead finds proof that the photograph is indeed an accurate depiction of a fairy.  He is forced to admit that there may indeed be more to life than meets the eye.Immediately heading out to the rural area where the woman and her daughters live, he dedicates himself to exploring the mystery contained in the photograph.  Although the woman dies in an accident soon after his arrival, he stays on and tries to wrest the secret of the fairies from her daughters.  Meanwhile he must contend with her rigid, authoritarian husband (Ben Kingsley), an Anglican priest who despises everything the belief in fairies represents.  The struggle between the two men becomes a struggle between two social viewpoints--a close-minded, mean-spirited Christianity which spurns any sort of mystery which cannot be explained by its dogma, and the quest for knowledge by seekers for whom the conventional answers no longer work.  The film also builds tension between the idea of the meaningless, clockwork universe and the notion of a living, ensouled world.  There are stunning visual effects, with exquisite hovering fairies pulling the viewer into Castle's alluring alternate reality.  Meanwhile, the film's interpersonal and social conflicts intensify in measured steps,  ultimately exploding in a violent act of destruction.Perhaps what is most compelling about the story, however, is the development of Charles Castle's character from a bitter materialist into a man who trusts his perceptions in the face of intense social pressure to conform.  There is a fascinating ambiguity towards the end of the film, as we see, on the one hand, Castle veering into what many might call madness.  On the other hand we must also question the sanity of a society which so blindly adheres to ignorance of realities beyond our narrow, everyday vision.  We are left with the feeling that perhaps his choices are the only sane ones he is able to make given the culture he is forced to live in.  And his courage in facing the unknown is thrown into  high relief against the backdrop of his peers' craven clinging to a socially sanctioned worldview.

For those who have been touched to the soul by that one perfect love, this story will resonate like an ethereal bell of purest shimmering crystal.
