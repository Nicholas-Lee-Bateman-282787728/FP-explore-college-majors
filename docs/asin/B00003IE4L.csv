545038,A28WI6XVNPOHDR,B00003IE4L,alper ercan,"[0, 0]","A great DVD with almost perfect sound and picture quality from prog-king Mike Portnoy,which consists of two discs and over 190 minutes of material and which gives in-depth information about Liquid Tension Experiment and LTE's first studio album, the making of ""Scenes from a Memory"" by Dream Theater and of course the drumming of MP.However I would not rate this DVD as a ""pure educational DVD"". The educational aspect of ""Liquid Drum Theater"" might disappoint some of the drummers out there, who desperately seeks the key element to play like Mike Portnoy does, or learn the secrets to progressive rock drumming. What you can mainly learn from this DVD tough, apart from Mike's set up and style-including but not limited to- is double-bass playing techniques, hand/feet combinations (which are Portnoy's speciality and he does them like noone else) and some of the fills and rhtyms from Mike's bag of tricks. Mike's solo at the end of Disc 1, which he performed at one of his cliniques, is one of his best so far.However, I have to add that, whether educational enough or not, I found this DVD to be quite entertaining. To me, this is not just an educational DVD for drummers, but a DVD which anybody who likes music and wishes to witness high quality musicianship would enjoy.If you are a drummer and like to learn more about the topics summarized above, don't miss it. And if you are a DT or/and LTE fan, whether drummer or not, this is a must have DVD for you.",5,Portnoy opens his bag of tricks,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,1464,"['great', 'DVD', 'almost', 'perfect', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'prog-king', 'Mike', 'Portnoy', 'two', 'discs', '190', 'minutes', 'material', 'in-depth', 'information', 'Liquid', 'Tension', 'Experiment', 'LTE', 'first', 'studio', 'album', 'making', 'Scenes', 'Memory', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'course', 'drumming', 'MP.However', 'would', 'not', 'rate', 'DVD', 'pure', 'educational', 'DVD', 'educational', 'aspect', 'Liquid', 'Drum', 'Theater', 'might', 'disappoint', 'drummers', 'there', 'who', 'desperately', 'key', 'element', 'play', 'Mike', 'Portnoy', 'learn', 'secrets', 'progressive', 'rock', 'drumming', 'What', 'can', 'mainly', 'learn', 'DVD', 'tough', 'apart', 'Mike', 'set', 'up', 'style-including', 'not', 'limited', 'to-', 'double-bass', 'playing', 'techniques', 'hand/feet', 'combinations', 'are', 'Portnoy', 'speciality', 'noone', 'else', 'fills', 'rhtyms', 'Mike', 'bag', 'tricks', 'Mike', 'solo', 'end', 'Disc', '1', 'performed', 'one', 'cliniques', 'one', 'best', 'so', 'far.However', 'have', 'add', 'educational', 'enough', 'not', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'not', 'just', 'educational', 'DVD', 'drummers', 'DVD', 'anybody', 'who', 'music', 'wishes', 'witness', 'high', 'quality', 'musicianship', 'would', 'enjoy.If', 'are', 'drummer', 'learn', 'more', 'topics', 'summarized', 'above', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'are', 'DT', 'or/and', 'LTE', 'fan', 'drummer', 'not', 'must', 'have', 'DVD']",Mike Portnoy:  Liquid Drum Theater VHS

It is pretty amazing to watch Mike Portnoy work his way thru some of Dream Theater &amp; Liquid Tension Experiment's toughest work.  I think Portnoy is probably-along with Ted Kirkpatrick of Tourniquet-the best rock/metal drummer ever.  And I'm a fan of Mr. Peart as well.  Anyway, there is a lot of material here to enjoy and it's fun to watch him explain the ideas behind different song parts and drum fills.  Seriously, this guy is just so much fun to watch, you'll forget you are actually learning something!  The highlight for me is the instrumental &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot; named after the NYC neighborhood.  Beautiful.  I can see why this was named &quot;Instructional Video of the Year&quot; by a number of drumming publications.

545041,A1WRHD16UO45Y0,B00003IE4L,"David Freis ""FREIS""","[2, 2]",Three strong words to describe this amazing human being.  Mike Portnoy is a machine.  This DVD is so much worth more than the measley [price] they are asking for.  There is so much extra live footage added and Mike even took the time to give an awesome commentary to an already awesome detailed look at his playing with Liquid Tension and Dream Theater.  I find that Mike does a great job at giving the fans what they want on his own and with Dream Theater.  This man deserves what he has and more as it is evident that he has worked hard to earn every penny and every bit of praise he receives.  What are you waiting for...order it!,5,Scary! Mastepiece!

545042,A19DS24NH20FS9,B00003IE4L,Jason Lindsey,"[14, 14]","This Two-Disc DVD set is really an improved version of the VHS tapes released two years ago, but now include bonus live performances, an audio commentary from Mike, camera angle switching options and photo gallery.The cool thing about this DVD set is that it really underlines the potential for the DVD format in the area of instructional videos. For anyone who has used VHS to learn either an instrument or foreign language, you know how difficult it is to keep forwarding and &quot;bookmarking&quot; particular sections that you are trying to study. Nobody just watches a video from beginning to end while learning a particular subject. You will want to focus on sections, sometimes for weeks at a time. With the DVD format and chapter breaks, it's simple to do and frankly makes any instructional VHS tape obsolete.The next fascinating thing about the DVD is the audio commentary. Already there are over 3 hours of playing and instructional information, but with the audio commentary on, you get a behind the scenes view of what it takes to make a video like this. One interesting tidbit was when Mike was talking about how a particular drum sequence was so difficult to get right in one take, that they actually took several different takes of him playing and spliced them together! You would have never guessed this unless you had the commentary on. The other great thing about it is just the ease at which Mike talks to the viewer and lets them in on all the details of being in a working rock band. He tells interesting stories of tours, recording sessions and drum technique. All of this is extremely interesting to practicing musician who just can't hear this stuff enough.Another technology introduced on this DVD is the multiple camera angles provided in certain sections. Mike is known for his use of double bass work and being able to fix the camera on those sections that are difficult to the viewer is invaluable!In conclusion, the DVD set is a MUST BUY for any musician hoping to improve their chops or just be entertained by the amazing drumming of Mike Portnoy. My girlfriend, who isn't even a musician, let alone drummer, actually enjoys just watching the DVD because of the great music. There is so much to this deep and useful instructional video that you will continue to view it for years to come.",5,Rockin',1006560000,"11 24, 2001",2001,2320,"['Two-Disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'really', 'improved', 'version', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'released', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'include', 'bonus', 'live', 'performances', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Mike', 'camera', 'angle', 'switching', 'options', 'photo', 'gallery.The', 'cool', 'thing', 'DVD', 'set', 'really', 'potential', 'DVD', 'format', 'area', 'instructional', 'videos', 'anyone', 'who', 'used', 'VHS', 'learn', 'instrument', 'foreign', 'language', 'know', 'how', 'difficult', 'keep', 'forwarding', 'quot', 'bookmarking', 'quot', 'particular', 'sections', 'are', 'trying', 'study', 'Nobody', 'just', 'video', 'beginning', 'end', 'learning', 'particular', 'subject', 'will', 'want', 'focus', 'sections', 'sometimes', 'weeks', 'time', 'DVD', 'format', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'simple', 'do', 'frankly', 'instructional', 'VHS', 'tape', 'next', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'are', '3', 'hours', 'playing', 'instructional', 'information', 'audio', 'commentary', 'get', 'scenes', 'view', 'what', 'make', 'video', 'One', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'was', 'when', 'Mike', 'was', 'talking', 'how', 'particular', 'drum', 'sequence', 'was', 'so', 'difficult', 'get', 'right', 'one', 'take', 'actually', 'took', 'several', 'different', 'playing', 'spliced', 'together', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'guessed', 'had', 'commentary', 'other', 'great', 'thing', 'just', 'ease', 'Mike', 'talks', 'viewer', 'details', 'being', 'working', 'rock', 'band', 'interesting', 'stories', 'tours', 'recording', 'sessions', 'drum', 'technique', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'practicing', 'musician', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'stuff', 'enough.Another', 'technology', 'introduced', 'DVD', 'multiple', 'camera', 'angles', 'provided', 'certain', 'sections', 'Mike', 'known', 'use', 'double', 'bass', 'work', 'being', 'able', 'fix', 'camera', 'sections', 'are', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'invaluable', 'conclusion', 'DVD', 'set', 'MUST', 'BUY', 'musician', 'hoping', 'improve', 'chops', 'just', 'be', 'entertained', 'amazing', 'drumming', 'Mike', 'Portnoy', 'My', 'girlfriend', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'musician', 'let', 'alone', 'drummer', 'actually', 'just', 'watching', 'DVD', 'great', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'deep', 'useful', 'instructional', 'video', 'will', 'continue', 'view', 'years', 'come']",Mike Portnoy:  Liquid Drum Theater VHS
