899450,A3T7MC28NFTYCH,B0008KLVCI,"Randall Ivey ""Randall""","[13, 14]","The subject matter is obviously heavy and weighs the audience down as much as the protagonist, but this is a mostly  successful (if highly earnest) adaptation of the famed memoir by prize-winning documentarian Barbara Gordon.  With such a lukewarm endorsement, my five-star rating may seem unwarranted, but this movie deserves a wide audience for one reason, as far as I'm concerned, and that's Geraldine Page's stunning supporting turn as the cancer-ravaged poet about whom Gordon is producing her latest work.  The scene in the hospital, when Page explodes at Clayburgh, for the sentimentality of the documentary, will raise all the hair on your body and is further proof of Page's greatness.  That she was not nominated for an Academy Award for this lacerating performance is an irrevocable blight on the movie industry.One day Page will get her due.

899451,ATCNPH85QAOTR,B0008KLVCI,SilentMira,"[0, 1]","Geraldine  Page was incredible as usual.  Her acting is timeless, thoughtful and sensitive.  It is no different in this movie, though the treatment of the movie's issues was different than it would be now. Back then they were just putting their toe in the water.  However Ms. Page was all in for her character. She DOES deserve 5 stars...always!The movie brushed lightly over a lot of topics that stem from the main plot but cannot follow them all in 90 minutes. Over the time since this was made, many have attempted to address the RX related issues. we are told from childhood to trust completely and never question the doctor's conclusions. The patient that went to his family doctor, putting his life and health in their hands has made themselves vulnerable to everyone.In the rush to blame the patient for any poor result, no one recalls the drug companies shilling their drugs on T.V. or paying doctors to push their products regardless of whether it was the ideal treatment.  From the patient begging for real help, he is now a junkie supposedly manipulating the poor innocent doctor to get the drugs advertised and promoted by the drug company as his cure. He is judged as a person of weak and wicked character for needing the medication that was specifically prescribed and is making drug companies and doctors rich in the market they created. The patient just wants what he has been led to expect from seeing a licensed physician... appropriate medical care that makes him better, not worse.And yippee! another opportunity...the rehab facilities, propaganda, products all blossoming to make more money to care for the use or misuse of the miracle product that they created and spent tons of money convincing everyone was the cure!  Note that most movies addressing addiction are about vulnerable, trusting women. Yow.  The movie did have lots of issues.This movie was a beginning in an area that was a secret and lightly brushed on ethics in the media.  It remained a secret until big business realized there was more big money to be made on the backs of every trusting patient.  It's so common place and expected now that people readily talk about paying to go to rehab a multitude of times. In fact, it's become a universal salve for bad behavior. Note that the rehab in this movie is really a shared mental ward.The movie is a baby step, but a giant step at this time in history. If you can appreciate it as documenting an evolution, you will enjoy this. And obviously...tons to think about!",4,Tip of the Ice Berg!,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,2504,"['Geraldine', 'Page', 'was', 'incredible', 'usual', 'acting', 'timeless', 'thoughtful', 'sensitive', 'different', 'movie', 'treatment', 'movie', 'issues', 'was', 'different', 'would', 'be', 'now', 'Back', 'then', 'were', 'just', 'putting', 'toe', 'water', 'However', 'Ms', 'Page', 'was', 'character', 'deserve', '5', 'stars', 'always', 'movie', 'brushed', 'lightly', 'lot', 'topics', 'stem', 'main', 'plot', 'can', 'not', 'follow', '90', 'minutes', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'many', 'have', 'attempted', 'address', 'RX', 'related', 'issues', 'are', 'told', 'childhood', 'trust', 'completely', 'never', 'question', 'doctor', 'conclusions', 'patient', 'went', 'family', 'doctor', 'putting', 'life', 'health', 'hands', 'made', 'vulnerable', 'everyone.In', 'rush', 'blame', 'patient', 'poor', 'result', 'one', 'drug', 'companies', 'shilling', 'drugs', 'T.V', 'paying', 'doctors', 'push', 'products', 'regardless', 'was', 'ideal', 'treatment', 'patient', 'begging', 'real', 'help', 'now', 'junkie', 'supposedly', 'manipulating', 'poor', 'innocent', 'doctor', 'get', 'drugs', 'advertised', 'promoted', 'drug', 'company', 'cure', 'judged', 'person', 'weak', 'wicked', 'character', 'needing', 'medication', 'was', 'specifically', 'prescribed', 'making', 'drug', 'companies', 'doctors', 'rich', 'market', 'created', 'patient', 'just', 'what', 'been', 'led', 'expect', 'seeing', 'licensed', 'physician', 'appropriate', 'medical', 'care', 'better', 'not', 'worse.And', 'yippee', 'opportunity', 'rehab', 'facilities', 'propaganda', 'products', 'blossoming', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'care', 'use', 'misuse', 'miracle', 'product', 'created', 'spent', 'tons', 'money', 'convincing', 'everyone', 'was', 'cure', 'Note', 'most', 'movies', 'addressing', 'addiction', 'are', 'vulnerable', 'trusting', 'women', 'Yow', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'lots', 'issues.This', 'movie', 'was', 'beginning', 'area', 'was', 'secret', 'lightly', 'brushed', 'ethics', 'media', 'remained', 'secret', 'big', 'business', 'realized', 'was', 'more', 'big', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'backs', 'trusting', 'patient', 'so', 'common', 'place', 'expected', 'now', 'people', 'readily', 'talk', 'paying', 'go', 'rehab', 'multitude', 'times', 'fact', 'become', 'universal', 'salve', 'bad', 'behavior', 'Note', 'rehab', 'movie', 'really', 'shared', 'mental', 'ward.The', 'movie', 'baby', 'step', 'giant', 'step', 'time', 'history', 'can', 'appreciate', 'documenting', 'evolution', 'will', 'enjoy', 'obviously', 'tons', 'think']",N/A

Quesenberry, Jr. ""70s & 80's horror fan""","[10, 12]","This movie requires insight and empathy for the lead character, otherwise it does appear the director did not adequately present what is the groundfloor to such addictions.  However, there is alot of character development here for those who listen carefully.  Barbara is tortured due to being unwanted and unloved and has used her career to cover it up along with Valium use.  She finally hits rock bottom and gets treatment via examining the sources of her rage filled inner-self.  This movie really stands out in memory from the 80's as a frank presentation of addiction, multiple competing roles, and the culture-of-Narcissm we live in and the sickness it can really create.  It shows that ""success"" is merely another cover up, another addiction with some people.  Lovinging oneself is unconditional if it is real and yes you ""don't have to cripple yourself to be loved.""",5,A struggle with early childhood pain and the stress of modern living.,1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,874,"['movie', 'insight', 'empathy', 'lead', 'character', 'otherwise', 'appear', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'adequately', 'present', 'what', 'groundfloor', 'such', 'addictions', 'However', 'alot', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'who', 'listen', 'carefully', 'Barbara', 'tortured', 'due', 'being', 'unwanted', 'unloved', 'used', 'career', 'cover', 'up', 'Valium', 'use', 'finally', 'rock', 'bottom', 'treatment', 'examining', 'sources', 'rage', 'filled', 'inner-self', 'movie', 'really', 'out', 'memory', '80', 'frank', 'presentation', 'addiction', 'multiple', 'competing', 'roles', 'culture-of-Narcissm', 'live', 'sickness', 'can', 'really', 'create', 'success', 'merely', 'cover', 'up', 'addiction', 'people', 'Lovinging', 'unconditional', 'real', 'yes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cripple', 'be', 'loved']",N/A
