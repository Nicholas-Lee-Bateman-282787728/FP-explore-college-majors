Suffice it to say, I would not want to get on her bad side! In this production, we see the brooding Jessica Drew. A woman alone and disconnected from greater society. When asked to join a secret government agency, she reluctantly agrees. But does she know what she is in for? I will not go into detail concerning the plot. Suffice it to say that it is dark--much darker than the TV series from over 30 years ago.To all those who feel they were duped--get over it! All you had to do was read the back to figure out this was a motion comic, and not an animated feature!

Valentine ""Ears picking up the sla...","[2, 4]","I've only just recently been discovering these newer Motion Comics that Marvel and DC (moreso Marvel, it seems) over the last couple years.  And I'm in love with the who new approach to adapting the comic source material.  It's much better, in my opinion, than the usual approach of watering down the visuals and simplifying the whole affair into a generic animated movie format that inevitably turns out to be aimed more at kids and the intellectually undemanding.  Other reviews here have called this Spider-Woman film ""boring"" and ""slow.""  While it is perhaps a little less accessible that Iron Man Extremis and X-Men Gifted, my reaction was WHAAAAA?  I'm wasn't really a fan of Spider-Woman until seeing this story, which was much angrier and insightful and true to how an regular woman would react to an admittedly absurd comic book scenes complicating her life.I hope with all of my heart that Marvel and DC keep putting these films out and developing them into a more sophisticated medium that also preserves much of the original art from the books.  It doesn't seem all that expensive an endeavor and I'm positive the creative teams have to prefer it to the watered down Cartoon Network style that that does no favors to their efforts.Iron Man Extremis shows the possibilities of Motion Comics in action while the Thor and Loki story shows its more dramatic muscles.As for Spider-Woman, no, she's not my favorite.  Wish she had another name because I hate the logic of, oh, there's Donald Duck so there has to be a more girl friendly version, too.  That seems like such ancient thinking and this character deserves much better after what Brian Michael Bendis has done to develop her.",4,I'm just discovering Motion Comics,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,1691,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'just', 'recently', 'been', 'discovering', 'newer', 'Motion', 'Comics', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'moreso', 'Marvel', 'last', 'couple', 'years', ""'m"", 'love', 'who', 'new', 'approach', 'adapting', 'comic', 'source', 'material', 'much', 'better', 'opinion', 'usual', 'approach', 'watering', 'down', 'visuals', 'simplifying', 'whole', 'affair', 'generic', 'animated', 'movie', 'format', 'inevitably', 'out', 'be', 'aimed', 'more', 'kids', 'intellectually', 'undemanding', 'Other', 'reviews', 'here', 'have', 'called', 'Spider-Woman', 'film', 'boring', 'slow', 'perhaps', 'little', 'less', 'accessible', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Extremis', 'X-Men', 'Gifted', 'reaction', 'was', 'WHAAAAA', ""'m"", 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'fan', 'Spider-Woman', 'seeing', 'story', 'was', 'much', 'angrier', 'insightful', 'true', 'how', 'regular', 'woman', 'would', 'react', 'admittedly', 'absurd', 'comic', 'book', 'scenes', 'complicating', 'life.I', 'hope', 'heart', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'keep', 'putting', 'films', 'out', 'developing', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'medium', 'also', 'much', 'original', 'art', 'books', ""n't"", 'seem', 'expensive', 'endeavor', ""'m"", 'positive', 'creative', 'teams', 'have', 'prefer', 'watered', 'down', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'style', 'favors', 'efforts.Iron', 'Man', 'Extremis', 'possibilities', 'Motion', 'Comics', 'action', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'story', 'more', 'dramatic', 'muscles.As', 'Spider-Woman', 'not', 'favorite', 'Wish', 'had', 'name', 'hate', 'logic', 'oh', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'so', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'girl', 'friendly', 'version', 'too', 'such', 'ancient', 'thinking', 'character', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'Brian', 'Michael', 'Bendis', 'done', 'develop']",N/A

The mouths don't move, there's no secondary action, and most of the time nothing in the panel moves at all.  At the beginning I thought Spider-Woman and Brand were having a psychic conversation on the bus.  The CG is poor and really stands out as it doesn't come close to matching the artwork.Positives are the core artwork is good.  I like the story well enough.  Spider-Woman's voice actor is actually pretty good and I didn't mind her talking.  Problem is no one's lips move so I can never tell when she is internalizing or not.The special features are there but the ""Making of"" was the only one I found to be remotely interesting.  You gotta take into consideration that this was one of their first and clearly had a much lower budget then Black Panther.  Also it was a different team then that show.

Drew, who's Spider-woman persona had been co-opted as the Skrull queen, is now a hated hero and woman.  She is on the outs with the world and she is weary and wondering where, or if, she'll fit back in.  She's given a job by the enigmatic S.W.O.R.D. to track down and kill with prejudice if she chooses Skrulls who remain on earth.  She uses her investigative abilities to do so in a back-island scumhole known as Madripoor and faces off against a powerhouse Skrull, Madame Hydra, and a small crew of super-powered assassins.  As a matter of fact, aside from the lovely faux nudes of Spider-woman dressed as Spider-woman on the cover galleries and box art, we see very little of JD in Spider-woman garb throughout these motion comics.

I'm done with marvel knight movies. xmen of some sort is coming out soon and I'm skipping it. this will be the first movie I completely will have 0 interest in even watching, much less buying. the sad part is the ranks of people saying the same thing is growing.this pos was on a trade site 5 mins after it ended",1,"don't just run away, run away screaming",1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,888,"['only', 'thing', 'worst', 'artwork', 'was', 'story', 'line', 'same', 'motion', 'comic', 'crap', 'was', 'absolute', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'come', 'up', 'date', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'motion', 'was', 'limited', 'background', 'show', 'something', 'moving', 'main', 'focus', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'move', 'was', 'hearing', 'comic', 'book', 'being', 'read', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'could', 'barely', 'finish', ""'watching"", 'mentioned', 'few', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'finished', 'laughing/mocking', 'buying', 'be', 'well', 'known', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'awful', ""'m"", 'done', 'marvel', 'knight', 'movies', 'xmen', 'sort', 'coming', 'out', 'soon', ""'m"", 'skipping', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'movie', 'completely', 'will', 'have', '0', 'interest', 'even', 'watching', 'much', 'less', 'buying', 'sad', 'part', 'ranks', 'people', 'saying', 'same', 'thing', 'growing.this', 'pos', 'was', 'trade', 'site', '5', 'mins', 'ended']",N/A
