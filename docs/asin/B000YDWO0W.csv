If anything, the movie felt like it could and SHOULD have been so much more.Instead, we were treated to a storyline that built slowly and gradually, and by the time the actual fear was present, there simply wasn't enough of it to satisfy me.  So the movie comes up a BIT short.With that said, I am honestly VERY impressed with the atmosphere of the place the eight people were trapped in.  Around every single corner of the place you can sense dread and a place of many deaths and emotional confusion, and that was the obvious high point of the movie for me- the atmosphere and the fear that something very bad could happen at any moment.So yeah, this movie is still pretty good and I recommend it, contains plenty of suspense along with a pretty good story- you just can't help but feel the story could have been even better than what we ended up with.",4,pretty scary,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,969,"['can', 'see', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'received', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'well', 'comments', 'are', 'completely', 'understandable', 'anything', 'movie', 'felt', 'could', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more.Instead', 'were', 'treated', 'storyline', 'built', 'slowly', 'gradually', 'time', 'actual', 'fear', 'was', 'present', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'satisfy', 'movie', 'up', 'BIT', 'short.With', 'said', 'am', 'honestly', 'VERY', 'impressed', 'atmosphere', 'place', 'eight', 'people', 'were', 'trapped', 'single', 'corner', 'place', 'can', 'sense', 'dread', 'place', 'many', 'deaths', 'emotional', 'confusion', 'was', 'obvious', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'me-', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'something', 'very', 'bad', 'could', 'happen', 'moment.So', 'yeah', 'movie', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'recommend', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'pretty', 'good', 'story-', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'what', 'ended', 'up']",N/A

1119239,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YDWO0W,Chris Pandolfi,"[12, 18]","""Crazy Eights"" is enigmatic and brooding, a clever psychological thriller with a supernatural twist. It opens with some information: a number of research centers were built in the most remote areas of the south, and they housed a number of children for the purposes of experimentation. Most of the time, these children were never heard from again. From this, the story builds slowly, which gives the audience time to take in the stylistic approach. Practically every room the characters occupy is grimy, faded, and poorly lit, and this creates a satisfying level of tension that doesn't release itself too quickly. I appreciated the look as well as the overall sense of foreboding, and this is despite the fact that it's occasionally piled on too thick. There's genuine imagination at work, here--a film that unnerves just as much as it entertains.The overall theme is that of remembering, and that's exactly what happens to six people who reunite after the death of their childhood friend, who had grown up to be a writer. These are: Father Lyle Dey (George Newbern); Gina Conte (Traci Lords); Brent Sykes (Frank Whaley); Jennifer Jones (Dina Meyer); Beth Patterson (Gabrielle Anwar); and Wayne Morrison (Dan DeLuca, who also co-wrote the screenplay). Their friend's will states that they must travel to a distant location and find a chest filled with their old possessions. Why their friend wanted this is a mystery, but they all seem willing to go (although some need more convincing than others). They arrive at a barn seemingly in the middle of nowhere, and it's there that they find the chest. Upon opening it, they make a gruesome discovery, one that kick starts a series of strange occurrences.The six friends soon find themselves trapped within an abandoned medical facility, and it seems as if there's no hope of escape. All the windows are barred. Most of the doors are locked. And worst of all, they begin to remember things they never even knew they had forgotten. There's a scene in which Brent asks for a pot, a spoon, and a jar full of sugar; Jennifer is able to find every one of those items quickly, as if she had been in that kitchen before. Later on, Gina is able to find a blanket for Beth. She knew where to find the blankets, yet she has never been to this place before. Or has she? Have they all? Are memories from their past resurfacing after being buried for over twenty years? It sure seems that way because something is there with them, some otherworldly force that wants them to remember.This force affects the characters in different ways, beginning with nightmares and horrendous visions. Beth, for example, is an artist, and we first see her sculpting a disturbing bust; she frantically kneads and smoothes the clay, whispering, ""Who are you?"" over and over. Now in the facility, she reads specific pages of the dead friend's novel, finding that the words echo the reality the remaining group is facing. The situation becomes extreme enough that she begins to regress, going so far as to suck her thumb. But it's not just Beth--Brent is also visibly shaken, and he gets angrier and angrier as time passes. He was always the more obnoxious one of the group, always having some wry comment for everything and never willing to accept what's happening. He repeatedly vows to escape this place, although deep down, he probably knows that he can't.At a certain point, the ghost within the facility begins attacking, leaving our group in the dark about what to do or where to go. They start to remember something about guilt, about how society would not survive without inherent emotions--""The definition of a psychopath,"" says a college professor at the beginning of the film, ""is a man without guilt."" So then this has all become a test, a way for the group to find the guilt within them and remove it. But how? And what does any of that have to do with people lured to an abandoned building? The mystery keeps on building, so much so that I began to think we wouldn't get any answers.Fortunately, we do, but not in a way that's straightforward. ""Crazy Eights"" is a horror film that requires some thought on the audience's part, which is refreshing and baffling at the same time. But on the whole, the film's good aspects outweigh the disappointing ones--I left the theater feeling as if I had actually used my head, which is a nice change from just sitting there and letting meaningless images pass by. I have to admit that I didn't think it would be so enjoyable; the title alone is awfully amateurish, like that of a direct-to-video clunker. But that's a case of judging a book by its cover, which should never be done. Bad title or not, this movie works, and works well.",4,Remembering the Past,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,4701,"['Crazy', 'Eights', 'enigmatic', 'brooding', 'clever', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'supernatural', 'twist', 'information', 'number', 'research', 'centers', 'were', 'built', 'most', 'remote', 'areas', 'south', 'housed', 'number', 'children', 'purposes', 'experimentation', 'Most', 'time', 'children', 'were', 'never', 'heard', 'again', 'story', 'slowly', 'audience', 'time', 'take', 'stylistic', 'approach', 'Practically', 'room', 'characters', 'occupy', 'grimy', 'faded', 'poorly', 'lit', 'satisfying', 'level', 'tension', ""n't"", 'release', 'too', 'quickly', 'appreciated', 'look', 'as', 'well', 'overall', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'fact', 'occasionally', 'piled', 'too', 'thick', 'genuine', 'imagination', 'work', 'here', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'overall', 'theme', 'remembering', 'exactly', 'what', 'six', 'people', 'who', 'reunite', 'death', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'writer', 'are', 'Father', 'Lyle', 'Dey', 'George', 'Newbern', 'Gina', 'Conte', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'Brent', 'Sykes', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'Beth', 'Patterson', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'Wayne', 'Morrison', 'Dan', 'DeLuca', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'friend', 'will', 'must', 'travel', 'distant', 'location', 'find', 'chest', 'filled', 'old', 'possessions', 'Why', 'friend', 'wanted', 'mystery', 'seem', 'willing', 'go', 'need', 'more', 'convincing', 'others', 'arrive', 'barn', 'seemingly', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'find', 'chest', 'opening', 'make', 'gruesome', 'discovery', 'one', 'series', 'strange', 'occurrences.The', 'six', 'friends', 'soon', 'find', 'trapped', 'abandoned', 'medical', 'facility', 'hope', 'escape', 'windows', 'are', 'barred', 'Most', 'doors', 'are', 'locked', 'worst', 'begin', 'remember', 'things', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'had', 'forgotten', 'scene', 'Brent', 'pot', 'spoon', 'jar', 'full', 'sugar', 'Jennifer', 'able', 'find', 'one', 'items', 'quickly', 'had', 'been', 'kitchen', 'before', 'Later', 'Gina', 'able', 'find', 'blanket', 'Beth', 'knew', 'where', 'find', 'blankets', 'yet', 'never', 'been', 'place', 'before', 'Have', 'Are', 'memories', 'past', 'resurfacing', 'being', 'buried', 'twenty', 'years', 'sure', 'way', 'something', 'there', 'otherworldly', 'force', 'remember.This', 'force', 'characters', 'different', 'ways', 'beginning', 'nightmares', 'horrendous', 'visions', 'Beth', 'example', 'artist', 'first', 'see', 'sculpting', 'disturbing', 'bust', 'frantically', 'kneads', 'clay', 'whispering', 'Who', 'are', 'Now', 'facility', 'specific', 'pages', 'dead', 'friend', 'novel', 'finding', 'words', 'echo', 'reality', 'remaining', 'group', 'facing', 'situation', 'extreme', 'enough', 'regress', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'suck', 'thumb', 'not', 'just', 'Beth', 'Brent', 'also', 'visibly', 'shaken', 'angrier', 'angrier', 'time', 'passes', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'obnoxious', 'one', 'group', 'always', 'having', 'wry', 'comment', 'everything', 'never', 'willing', 'accept', 'what', 'happening', 'repeatedly', 'escape', 'place', 'deep', 'down', 'probably', 'certain', 'point', 'ghost', 'facility', 'attacking', 'leaving', 'group', 'dark', 'what', 'do', 'where', 'go', 'start', 'remember', 'something', 'guilt', 'how', 'society', 'would', 'not', 'survive', 'inherent', 'emotions', 'definition', 'psychopath', 'college', 'professor', 'beginning', 'film', 'man', 'guilt', 'So', 'then', 'become', 'test', 'way', 'group', 'find', 'guilt', 'remove', 'how', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'people', 'lured', 'abandoned', 'building', 'mystery', 'building', 'so', 'much', 'began', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'answers.Fortunately', 'do', 'not', 'way', 'straightforward', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'horror', 'film', 'thought', 'audience', 'part', 'refreshing', 'baffling', 'same', 'time', 'whole', 'film', 'good', 'aspects', 'outweigh', 'disappointing', 'ones', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'had', 'actually', 'used', 'head', 'nice', 'change', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'letting', 'meaningless', 'images', 'pass', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'title', 'alone', 'awfully', 'amateurish', 'direct-to-video', 'clunker', 'case', 'judging', 'book', 'cover', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'Bad', 'title', 'not', 'movie', 'well']",N/A

1119241,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000YDWO0W,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","The really bad thing about group-shared repressed memories is the fact that, sooner or later, one member of the group is going to bring those repressed memories back to life and basically ruin the lives of everyone else in the group.  That's pretty much what happens here in Crazy Eights.  Six old friends are reunited following the death of one member of their Crazy Eights gang from childhood (you'll notice that six plus one makes seven, not eight - hmmm, I wonder if that might be significant?).  Anyway, this guy apparently offs himself and then, by way of his will, gets the rest of the gang to come back and open an old time capsule from their childhood.  Ah, the power of memory!  How it cuts like a knife through one's very soul!Crazy Eights gives us quite a diverse group of characters, including a kind-hearted padre, a foul-mouthed doctor, and a level-headed college professor.  All six of the reunited friends seem to be successful but not exactly well-adjusted, as each of them has recently been haunted by recurring nightmares.  The reason for those nightmares slowly begins to emerge after they open the time capsule and find more than childhood toys lurking inside.  Despite their sudden, understandable eagerness to get back home to their normal lives, they soon find themselves trapped inside a huge facility of some kind.  Herein lurk the real skeletons in their collective closet.  Thanks to the opening moments of the film, we viewers already know what this place is, but it takes a while for the characters to figure it out.  Put to the psychological test, several of them break down, but none can flee from the dark destiny haunting the corridors of the place.  One by one, the group of six is isolated and marked for death.I seem to have enjoyed this After Dark Horror Fest offering more than most.  While certain aspects of the story could use a little fleshing out, the circumstances make for quite a delicious little stew of guilt and horror.  The old building has tons of atmosphere, and some really good acting helps milk the creepy drama for all it is worth.  Traci Lords proves that she can act and George Newbern is superb as the padre - but it is Frank Whaley who really steals the show.  Not only does his foul mouth help liven up many a scene, he more than anyone else really brings out the psychological dimensions of the story.  Admittedly, the whole bit about characters foolishly wandering off by themselves and thereby inviting their own destruction is undeniably formulaic, while the premise under which the group finds themselves trapped like this is flimsy at best.  Likewise, the film provided me with more questions than answers in terms of the backstory.  Despite all this, Crazy Eights still turned out to be an effectively creepy little horror film as far as I'm concerned, one that fits quite well into the After Dark Horror Fest collection.",4,"Despite its plot holes, an entertaining and effective psychological horror film",1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,2891,"['really', 'bad', 'thing', 'group-shared', 'repressed', 'memories', 'fact', 'sooner', 'later', 'one', 'member', 'group', 'going', 'bring', 'repressed', 'memories', 'back', 'life', 'basically', 'ruin', 'lives', 'everyone', 'else', 'group', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'here', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'Six', 'old', 'friends', 'are', 'reunited', 'following', 'death', 'one', 'member', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'gang', 'childhood', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'six', 'one', 'seven', 'not', 'eight', 'hmmm', 'wonder', 'might', 'be', 'significant', 'Anyway', 'guy', 'apparently', 'then', 'way', 'will', 'rest', 'gang', 'come', 'back', 'open', 'old', 'time', 'capsule', 'childhood', 'Ah', 'power', 'memory', 'How', 'knife', 'one', 'very', 'soul', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'quite', 'diverse', 'group', 'characters', 'including', 'kind-hearted', 'padre', 'foul-mouthed', 'doctor', 'level-headed', 'college', 'professor', 'six', 'reunited', 'friends', 'seem', 'be', 'successful', 'not', 'exactly', 'well-adjusted', 'recently', 'been', 'haunted', 'recurring', 'nightmares', 'reason', 'nightmares', 'slowly', 'emerge', 'open', 'time', 'capsule', 'find', 'more', 'childhood', 'toys', 'lurking', 'inside', 'sudden', 'understandable', 'eagerness', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'normal', 'lives', 'soon', 'find', 'trapped', 'huge', 'facility', 'kind', 'Herein', 'lurk', 'real', 'skeletons', 'collective', 'closet', 'Thanks', 'opening', 'moments', 'film', 'viewers', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'place', 'while', 'characters', 'figure', 'out', 'Put', 'psychological', 'test', 'several', 'break', 'down', 'none', 'can', 'flee', 'dark', 'destiny', 'haunting', 'corridors', 'place', 'One', 'one', 'group', 'six', 'isolated', 'marked', 'death.I', 'seem', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Dark', 'Horror', 'Fest', 'offering', 'more', 'most', 'certain', 'aspects', 'story', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'fleshing', 'out', 'circumstances', 'make', 'quite', 'delicious', 'little', 'stew', 'guilt', 'horror', 'old', 'building', 'tons', 'atmosphere', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'milk', 'creepy', 'drama', 'worth', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'can', 'act', 'George', 'Newbern', 'superb', 'padre', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'Not', 'only', 'foul', 'mouth', 'help', 'liven', 'up', 'many', 'scene', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'really', 'out', 'psychological', 'dimensions', 'story', 'Admittedly', 'whole', 'bit', 'characters', 'foolishly', 'wandering', 'off', 'thereby', 'inviting', 'own', 'destruction', 'undeniably', 'formulaic', 'premise', 'group', 'trapped', 'flimsy', 'best', 'Likewise', 'film', 'provided', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'terms', 'backstory', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'still', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'one', 'quite', 'well', 'Dark', 'Horror', 'Fest', 'collection']",N/A

I love psychological thrillers...the promise of this is what drew me to this film.  However, it fell flat and left me upset I spent $3.99 and 80 minutes of my time on it.  It does not require you to think except to think 'What the...?'  Nothing really makes sense, there is no logic as far as why these people had to die (they accidentally killed a little girl while subjects of some crazy doctors...abandoned by their parents, apparently....how is that something they should be punished for as adults?)  The ending left me completely baffled.  Of course, by then, I'd pretty much given up on the movie.  Dina Meyers says 'I'm the only one left' after she destroys the toys that supposedly hold the link to getting them out of the hospital.  So, she has to kill herself to set herself free?  What?  And then suddenly she's a little girl again choosing between a trunk holding redemption and another representing more testing.  Again...what?I agree with the other reviewers comments about Session 9.  That was a generally creepy movie and it's twists actually contain logic that you can follow without having to pry open the writer/director's brain or crawl around for scraps on the cutting room floor.I definitely see NO comparison to The Big Chill.  I can't believe it was brought up.  TBC is a phenomenal movie with real stars, a great plot, and well thought-out character development.  It has nothing in common with Crazy Eights.  And this film only boasted Whalley- who's been not been consistently good in films.  And, frankly, none of them should have bothered.  I wonder if the script they read was completely different from what we saw or perhaps when the director explained it to them, he provided insight we weren't privileged to in the process of watching the movie.Something just seems lost here- I believe it's the plot.

1119250,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000YDWO0W,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 7]","The title of ""Crazy Eights"" refers to the name a group of kids gave their baseball team.  When six of them gather for a funeral of the seventh, one of them points out that eight is one short of how many people you need to have on a baseball team.  However, what they do not notice is that seven is one short of being eight, and, of course, that eighth member of the group is the reason why the others will start dying one by one.  I keep waiting for these people to do the math (a line that is acutally used early in the film), but the crucial flaw in director James Koya Jones' film is that the audience is way ahead of the characters who never really catch up to what is going on.This particular Horrorfest 2007 entry begins with a series of title cards talking about how in former days, that is to say once upon a time, doctors got to do all sorts of experiments on little kids.  Now six of these kids meet up at the funeral of one of their friends, where they learn that he wanted them to find a time capsule they buried as kids.  The time capsule turns out to have a surprise in it and the next things the six friends know they end up in a long-abandoned hospital.  How they get to the hospital will not really make sense to you, but more troublesome is that paradox that these people all consider themselves to have been friends since childhood but they cannot remember the childhood in which they were friends (otherwise they would know where they were and why).  It just takes too long for them to connect the dots, and since the set up for the film makes such a big point about the past, then making the connections should be important.  Instead, people start dying, with a minimum of blood and gore (relatively speaking).  The ending, which was rather abrupt, reminded me a bit of ""The Blair Witch Project"" in that things do come full circle, in a manner of speaking, but you are left unimpressed by the results.Usually in a splatter flick you have a group of teenagers or young adults who, to varying degreees, do things to warrant their gruesome deaths.  At one extreme I think of the recent remake ofHouse of Wax, where these kids went out the way to deserve to die; at the other end of the spectrum would be a movie where the homicidal maniac just happens to target a slumber party of innocent (but scantily clad) young girls.  ""Crazy Eights"" straddles both poles because on the one hand these people clearly did something as kids to have this ghost after them, but on the other hand they were being experimented on by adults, who would seem (at least to me) to bear primary responsibility.  Consequently, I can never really decide if these victims deserve to die or not.  In trying to have it both ways, the film ends up losing both ways.  When the best thing going for a horror film is the setting, that is not good news (see ""Session 9"" for a better film set in an abandoned hospital).There is a line on the back of the DVD from Hollywood.com about how this movie has ""A twisted and dark `Big Chill' noteworthy cast,"" and having Gabrielle Anwar (""Scent of a Woman""), Dina Meyer (""Saw""), Traci Lords (""Blade""), and Frank Whaley (""Vacancy"") would seem to evidence the point.  But by the end of this movie you have to be wondering why they bothered.  What were they attracted to here?  Did they consider this movie to be a step up in their careers?  A quick pay check?  The comparison to ""The Big Chill"" is telling because that was a movie that clearly defined each of the members of the group, and the same cannot be said for this one.  Whaley plays the jerk, Anwar is the sensitive one, and Lords the foul-mouthed one.  The movie only runs 80 minutes, so there is not a lot of time to do a lot of things in this film, such as develop characters.  However, in the final analysis it is the refusal of the film to connect the dots and provide a coherent picture of the situation that dooms ""Crazy Eights.""It turns out that only three of this second set of 8 films 2 die 4 have any DVD features beyond the Miss Horrorfest Contst webepisodes.  Only one of last year's set of film did not have commentary tracks and/or other features, so this parcity of bonus features seems to be another nail in the coffin of Horrofest (which did not even make it to the Zenith City for the second go round).  Halfway through these films the results are certainly less impressive than last year's offerings.  Tonight's attempt to reverse the downward spiral will be ""Nightmare Man,"" which should at least inspire a nice song parody off of the Beatles' ""Nowhere Man.""",3,A noteworthy cast cannot connect the dots quick enough before they die,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,4561,"['title', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'refers', 'name', 'group', 'kids', 'gave', 'baseball', 'team', 'When', 'six', 'gather', 'funeral', 'seventh', 'one', 'points', 'out', 'eight', 'one', 'short', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'need', 'have', 'baseball', 'team', 'However', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'notice', 'seven', 'one', 'short', 'being', 'eight', 'course', 'member', 'group', 'reason', 'why', 'others', 'will', 'start', 'dying', 'one', 'one', 'keep', 'waiting', 'people', 'do', 'math', 'line', 'acutally', 'used', 'early', 'film', 'crucial', 'flaw', 'director', 'James', 'Koya', 'Jones', 'film', 'audience', 'way', 'ahead', 'characters', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'on.This', 'particular', 'Horrorfest', '2007', 'entry', 'series', 'title', 'cards', 'talking', 'how', 'former', 'days', 'say', 'once', 'time', 'doctors', 'got', 'do', 'sorts', 'experiments', 'little', 'kids', 'Now', 'six', 'kids', 'meet', 'up', 'funeral', 'one', 'friends', 'where', 'learn', 'wanted', 'find', 'time', 'capsule', 'buried', 'kids', 'time', 'capsule', 'out', 'have', 'surprise', 'next', 'things', 'six', 'friends', 'know', 'end', 'up', 'long-abandoned', 'hospital', 'How', 'get', 'hospital', 'will', 'not', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'more', 'troublesome', 'paradox', 'people', 'consider', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'childhood', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'childhood', 'were', 'friends', 'would', 'know', 'where', 'were', 'why', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'connect', 'dots', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'big', 'point', 'past', 'then', 'making', 'connections', 'should', 'be', 'important', 'Instead', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'minimum', 'blood', 'gore', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'ending', 'was', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'things', 'do', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'manner', 'speaking', 'are', 'left', 'unimpressed', 'results.Usually', 'splatter', 'flick', 'have', 'group', 'teenagers', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'varying', 'degreees', 'do', 'things', 'warrant', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'one', 'extreme', 'think', 'recent', 'remake', 'ofHouse', 'Wax', 'where', 'kids', 'went', 'way', 'deserve', 'die', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'where', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'just', 'target', 'slumber', 'party', 'innocent', 'scantily', 'clad', 'young', 'girls', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'straddles', 'poles', 'one', 'hand', 'people', 'clearly', 'did', 'something', 'kids', 'have', 'ghost', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'being', 'experimented', 'adults', 'who', 'would', 'seem', 'least', 'bear', 'primary', 'responsibility', 'Consequently', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'decide', 'victims', 'deserve', 'die', 'not', 'trying', 'have', 'ways', 'film', 'up', 'losing', 'ways', 'When', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'horror', 'film', 'setting', 'not', 'good', 'news', 'see', 'Session', '9', 'better', 'film', 'set', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'line', 'back', 'DVD', 'Hollywood.com', 'how', 'movie', 'A', 'twisted', 'dark', 'Big', 'Chill', 'noteworthy', 'cast', 'having', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'Saw', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'Blade', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'Vacancy', 'would', 'seem', 'evidence', 'point', 'end', 'movie', 'have', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'bothered', 'What', 'were', 'attracted', 'here', 'Did', 'consider', 'movie', 'be', 'step', 'up', 'careers', 'quick', 'pay', 'check', 'comparison', 'Big', 'Chill', 'telling', 'was', 'movie', 'clearly', 'defined', 'members', 'group', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'one', 'Whaley', 'jerk', 'Anwar', 'sensitive', 'one', 'foul-mouthed', 'one', 'movie', 'only', '80', 'minutes', 'not', 'lot', 'time', 'do', 'lot', 'things', 'film', 'such', 'develop', 'characters', 'However', 'final', 'analysis', 'refusal', 'film', 'connect', 'dots', 'provide', 'coherent', 'picture', 'situation', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'out', 'only', 'three', 'second', 'set', '8', 'films', '2', 'die', '4', 'have', 'DVD', 'features', 'Miss', 'Horrorfest', 'Contst', 'webepisodes', 'Only', 'one', 'last', 'year', 'set', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'and/or', 'other', 'features', 'parcity', 'bonus', 'features', 'be', 'nail', 'coffin', 'Horrofest', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'make', 'Zenith', 'City', 'second', 'go', 'round', 'Halfway', 'films', 'results', 'are', 'certainly', 'less', 'impressive', 'last', 'year', 'offerings', 'Tonight', 'attempt', 'reverse', 'downward', 'spiral', 'will', 'be', 'Nightmare', 'Man', 'should', 'least', 'inspire', 'nice', 'song', 'parody', 'Beatles', 'Nowhere', 'Man']",N/A

A very strong cast ups the watchable factor and a truly claustrophobic atmosphere permeates this story of a group of people mysteriously led to and trapped in an abandoned old house. The ""house"" was really an institution for behavioral research...and experiments. And more disturbing, the subjects were children. As the group tries to get out, things start to happen.  Something else is in there with them, too, of supernatural origin. You have to be patient for the first part of the film but as the tension builds  it becomes engrossing, even chilling. As I said, the cast is remarkable. Traci Lords and Dina Meyer are excellent. Gabrielle Anwar is creepy as the withdrawn, fragile one and the three male cast members do well. No nudity, no sex; some gore and violence and lots of the F word earned the ""R"" rating here. Some things are a little confusing and could've been handled better but the horrific undertones of the atmosphere and sets work like they're supposed to. You know some horrible things went on in this building. This is a ""lights out"" film that relies on creepiness and disturbing inferences before finally revealing it's bloody hand.

Crazy Eights revolves around a group of old friends (Dina Meyer, George Newbern, Traci Lords, Frank Whaley, Burn Notice's Gabrielle Anwar, and The Wire vet Dan DeLuca who also co-wrote this flick) who are re-united after the passing of a friend of theirs.  Turns out that all of them were involved in some sort of dark research and experiments, and soon enough all of them become trapped and start to get picked off.  What kills Crazy Eights is it's predictability: you know what's going to happen right before it happens.  Not to mention that there are so many non-sensical twists and developments that the film ends up becoming almost incomprehensible as it winds down, and the road getting there is more boring than anything else.  The grainy look of the film doesn't make matters any better either, but as said before, the cast is good.

One would think that if a screenplay were going to start off in a college psychology class, the writer would at the very least check to make sure that he wasn't substituting the definition of sociopath (one ""who lacks a sense of moral responsibility or social conscience"") for the definition of psychopath (one who ""manifests amoral and antisocial behavior, lack of ability to love or establish meaningful relationships, extreme egocentricity, failure to learn from mistakes, etc.""; both definitions from [...]). This movie was pretty much destined to be picked up by After Dark Horrorfest from the first moment Jones (The Wreck) and Dan DeLuca (The Jersey Devil), the screenwriters, put pen to paper. We move from one movie with one actress (Eliza Dushku) who's made awful career choices recently to one movie with TWO actresses, Dina Meyer and Traci Lords, who've done the same. And yet somehow, when I compare Crazy Eights to the aforementioned Open Graves, it's a pretty easy choice for which one comes out on top.This is an ensemble piece based around six friends--Jennifer Jones (Saw IV's Dina Meyer), Lyle Dey (TV character actor George Newbern), Gina Conte (Kinky Business' Traci Lords), Wayne Morrison (screenwriter DeLuca, whom you may know from TV's The Wire), Brent Sykes (Ruffian's Frank Whaley), and Beth Patterson (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead's Gabrielle Anwar)--who get together for the funeral of a friend. While acting as the executor of his estate, they discover a letter asking them to go uncover a time capsule they all buried twenty years before. When they do, they discover that along with all the detritus of childhood, there's also a body inside. To figure out why, they may all have to dig into some very long repressed memories...It's actually a pretty good idea, and the general caliber of the main cast--all of whom are at least veteran TV actors--should probably tip you off that this movie could have been a great deal better than it actually is. Another set of eyes on the script could have gotten rid of some of the more stupid plot points (e.g., they still remember each other twenty years later, but have forgotten pretty much everything else about growing up?) and tightened this a good deal. They might have come up with a really effective horror movie. (The ubiquitous-yet-treacly score didn't help in the least, though.) Potential it had plenty, but Jones, in his feature debut, didn't have nearly the experience to pull something like this off. Still, of the 2007 slate of After Dark movies, only Mulberry St. was better (not that After Dark traditionally sets the bar too high...), and when you compare it to the movie I watched just before it, Open Graves, it was a cinematic masterpiece. So maybe I'm being a little easier on it than I should, but if you're okay with completely shutting your brain off for an hour and a half and just enjoying the ride, the movie's atmosphere, along with bits of its acting, make up for the stupid score and idiotic plot holes. **",2,"Crazy actors, crazy directors, etc.",1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,3108,"['Crazy', 'Eights', 'James', 'K.', 'Jones', '2006', 'definition', 'psychopath', 'man', 'guilt', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'screenplay', 'were', 'going', 'start', 'off', 'college', 'psychology', 'class', 'writer', 'would', 'very', 'least', 'check', 'make', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'substituting', 'definition', 'sociopath', 'one', 'who', 'sense', 'moral', 'responsibility', 'social', 'conscience', 'definition', 'psychopath', 'one', 'who', 'amoral', 'antisocial', 'behavior', 'lack', 'ability', 'love', 'establish', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'extreme', 'egocentricity', 'failure', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'etc', 'definitions', '[', ']', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'destined', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'first', 'moment', 'Jones', 'Wreck', 'Dan', 'DeLuca', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'screenwriters', 'put', 'pen', 'paper', 'move', 'one', 'movie', 'one', 'actress', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'who', 'made', 'awful', 'career', 'choices', 'recently', 'one', 'movie', 'TWO', 'actresses', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'who', ""'ve"", 'done', 'same', 'yet', 'somehow', 'when', 'compare', 'Crazy', 'Eights', 'aforementioned', 'Open', 'Graves', 'pretty', 'easy', 'choice', 'one', 'out', 'top.This', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'based', 'six', 'friends', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Saw', 'IV', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'Lyle', 'Dey', 'TV', 'character', 'actor', 'George', 'Newbern', 'Gina', 'Conte', 'Kinky', 'Business', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'Wayne', 'Morrison', 'screenwriter', 'DeLuca', 'whom', 'may', 'know', 'TV', 'Wire', 'Brent', 'Sykes', 'Ruffian', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'Beth', 'Patterson', 'Things', 'Do', 'Denver', 'When', ""'re"", 'Dead', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'who', 'get', 'together', 'funeral', 'friend', 'acting', 'executor', 'estate', 'discover', 'letter', 'asking', 'go', 'uncover', 'time', 'capsule', 'buried', 'twenty', 'years', 'before', 'When', 'do', 'discover', 'detritus', 'childhood', 'also', 'body', 'inside', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'may', 'have', 'dig', 'very', 'long', 'repressed', 'memories', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'general', 'caliber', 'main', 'cast', 'whom', 'are', 'least', 'veteran', 'TV', 'actors', 'should', 'probably', 'tip', 'off', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'better', 'actually', 'set', 'eyes', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'rid', 'more', 'stupid', 'plot', 'points', 'e.g.', 'still', 'remember', 'other', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'forgotten', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'growing', 'up', 'tightened', 'good', 'deal', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'really', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'ubiquitous-yet-treacly', 'score', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'least', 'though', 'Potential', 'had', 'plenty', 'Jones', 'feature', 'debut', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'experience', 'pull', 'something', 'off', 'Still', '2007', 'slate', 'Dark', 'movies', 'only', 'Mulberry', 'St.', 'was', 'better', 'not', 'Dark', 'traditionally', 'bar', 'too', 'high', 'when', 'compare', 'movie', 'watched', 'just', 'Open', 'Graves', 'was', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'little', 'easier', 'should', ""'re"", 'okay', 'completely', 'shutting', 'brain', 'hour', 'half', 'just', 'enjoying', 'ride', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'bits', 'acting', 'make', 'up', 'stupid', 'score', 'idiotic', 'plot', 'holes', '**']",N/A

As has been mentioned before, I wasn't excited about the ending, since it seemed rushed and contrived. And the film couldn't always decide whether it wanted to be a psychological thriller or a story of a vengeful spirit. While the combination doesn't sound bad, sometimes the plot became bogged down by it.The premise is not bad. Friends come together to mourn the loss of one of their own, and have strange experiences tied to clues left by their deceased pal which leads them to an abandoned house. The house has a mysterious history, having been the site of experiments performed on children (don't worry, this gives nothing away). As our cast attempts to peice together the puzzle, they are haunted (make that hunted) by a restless spirit with a definite mean streak. There is a bit of gore, and certainly a sense of claustrophobia permiates the film. And while the acting is actually quite good, the characters feel undeveloped and rushed, which is too bad, considering there was a great deal of room for back stories.This is certainly worth checking out, just careful with your expectations. If you are like me, and watching each of last year's horrorfest, you'll still find this better than most of those from the previous lot.",3,Not a bad effort,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,1325,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'being', 'generous', 'three', 'stars', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'unfulfilling', 'been', 'mentioned', 'was', ""n't"", 'excited', 'ending', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'contrived', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'always', 'decide', 'wanted', 'be', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'story', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'combination', ""n't"", 'sound', 'bad', 'sometimes', 'plot', 'became', 'bogged', 'down', 'it.The', 'premise', 'not', 'bad', 'Friends', 'come', 'together', 'mourn', 'loss', 'one', 'own', 'have', 'strange', 'experiences', 'tied', 'clues', 'left', 'deceased', 'pal', 'abandoned', 'house', 'house', 'mysterious', 'history', 'having', 'been', 'site', 'experiments', 'performed', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'nothing', 'away', 'cast', 'attempts', 'peice', 'together', 'puzzle', 'are', 'haunted', 'make', 'hunted', 'restless', 'spirit', 'definite', 'mean', 'streak', 'bit', 'gore', 'certainly', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'film', 'acting', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'characters', 'feel', 'undeveloped', 'rushed', 'too', 'bad', 'considering', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'room', 'back', 'stories.This', 'certainly', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'just', 'careful', 'expectations', 'are', 'watching', 'last', 'year', 'horrorfest', ""'ll"", 'still', 'find', 'better', 'most', 'previous', 'lot']",N/A

Plus, there was the usual ""OK, let's us separate so we can be mysteriously picked off/murdered one-by-one"" gambit....yup, it was a bad movie.
