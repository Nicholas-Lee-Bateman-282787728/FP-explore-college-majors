Montgomery takes command. There will bo retreat, plans for withdrawal are burned. Rommel plans to hold the line, but he has health problems. The Italians try to dig holes for protection against shell splinters. Too late! Shells kill those in the open. Monty orders a scouting expedition. They discover fake gun positions and dummy soldiers! The Germans reinforce this line, but do not return fire to avoid warning the enemy. The British march towards the hidden enemy until they open fire. ""When I want your advice I""ll ask for it."" Rommel is recalled to Berlin. The Germans send out a patrol at night to check for mines. An explosion reveals the mines.One Italian lieutenant is captured and given treatment. Later he escapes and borrows a jeep to return to his lines. The British have a scheme to plant a phony map of the mine fields on the enemy. Three on a match? ""Him! Why him?"" The enemy buys this phony map and plans a surprise attack with tanks at night. The British will lay down a curtain barrage when the enemy tanks enter the trap. It works, they lose half. Back in Germany Rommel meets Admiral Canaris, head of intelligence. Rommel is ordered back to North Africa. The Italian orders his troops to sing in the night. The British attack all along the line, the Germans plan to fall back to Tobruk. Anti-tank weapons will remain on the line. The British have first-class weapons and ammunition to attack and win.The Germans are ordered to attack to the last man; Rommel ignores this command. British tanks attack with cannons, and roll forward. But a sandstorm reduces visibility so Monty orders a retreat. The Italians are ordered to fight to the last man. The Italians have mines that can be attached to tanks and explode. This takes daring and skill to knock out tanks. [This is why tanks are accompanied by troops.] The German tanks are saved by their retreat. The few remaining Italians surrender, their war is over. Imprisonment today is better than an unknown future.This is an interesting movie in presenting the war in North Africa from the Axis' viewpoint. There was a lot more going on in 1943 than in this one area.",4,The Battle as Seen by the Other Side,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,2274,"['Battle', 'El', 'Alamein', '1971', 'filmWe', 'see', 'combat', 'sand', 'dunes', 'North', 'Africa', 'Italians', 'attack', 'British', 'are', 'thrown', 'back', 'Montgomery', 'command', 'will', 'bo', 'retreat', 'withdrawal', 'are', 'burned', 'Rommel', 'hold', 'line', 'health', 'problems', 'Italians', 'try', 'dig', 'holes', 'protection', 'shell', 'splinters', 'Too', 'late', 'Shells', 'kill', 'open', 'Monty', 'orders', 'scouting', 'expedition', 'discover', 'fake', 'gun', 'positions', 'dummy', 'soldiers', 'Germans', 'reinforce', 'line', 'do', 'not', 'return', 'fire', 'avoid', 'warning', 'enemy', 'British', 'march', 'hidden', 'enemy', 'open', 'fire', 'When', 'want', 'advice', 'll', 'ask', 'Rommel', 'recalled', 'Berlin', 'Germans', 'send', 'out', 'patrol', 'night', 'check', 'mines', 'explosion', 'mines.One', 'Italian', 'lieutenant', 'captured', 'given', 'treatment', 'Later', 'jeep', 'return', 'lines', 'British', 'have', 'scheme', 'plant', 'phony', 'map', 'mine', 'fields', 'enemy', 'Three', 'match', 'Him', 'Why', 'enemy', 'phony', 'map', 'surprise', 'attack', 'tanks', 'night', 'British', 'will', 'lay', 'down', 'curtain', 'barrage', 'when', 'enemy', 'tanks', 'enter', 'trap', 'lose', 'half', 'Back', 'Germany', 'Rommel', 'Admiral', 'Canaris', 'head', 'intelligence', 'Rommel', 'ordered', 'back', 'North', 'Africa', 'Italian', 'orders', 'troops', 'sing', 'night', 'British', 'attack', 'line', 'Germans', 'plan', 'fall', 'back', 'Tobruk', 'Anti-tank', 'weapons', 'will', 'remain', 'line', 'British', 'have', 'first-class', 'weapons', 'ammunition', 'attack', 'win.The', 'Germans', 'are', 'ordered', 'attack', 'last', 'man', 'Rommel', 'command', 'British', 'tanks', 'attack', 'cannons', 'roll', 'forward', 'sandstorm', 'visibility', 'so', 'Monty', 'orders', 'retreat', 'Italians', 'are', 'ordered', 'fight', 'last', 'man', 'Italians', 'have', 'mines', 'can', 'be', 'attached', 'tanks', 'explode', 'daring', 'skill', 'knock', 'out', 'tanks', '[', 'why', 'tanks', 'are', 'accompanied', 'troops', ']', 'German', 'tanks', 'are', 'saved', 'retreat', 'few', 'remaining', 'Italians', 'surrender', 'war', 'Imprisonment', 'today', 'better', 'unknown', 'future.This', 'interesting', 'movie', 'presenting', 'war', 'North', 'Africa', 'Axis', 'viewpoint', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'going', '1943', 'one', 'area']",N/A

The auditory part was the worst, although the acting was sporadic in quality. I did not recognize a sick-looking Michael Rennie (as Montgomery) at first because it did not sound like him; for some idiotic reason, they had someone else speaking for him. As for the weaponry shown in the movie, it was a mishmash.The film's plot revolves around the battle of El Alamein, as seen from an Italian force. I have to admit that initially I was snickering about the Italians' portrayed bravery, since the Italians' reputation throughout the war, from beginning to end, was that they were all pathetic cowards, as bad as the French. Then I remembered that in North Africa there were indeed notable exceptions and there were several Italian units that had balls: the Bersaglieri, the Folgere, the Ariete. Unfortunately (for them), the incompetent Duce did not supply them well at all.There were three details worth mentioning. One, they should have actually shown the Germans stealing the Italians' transportation so that they could save their own hides. Some allies! The other detail that they did show was that occasionally the British murdered POWs; that's a part of history that we're not supposed to mention, though it did happen.

The Italians sided with the losers in WWII and logically wanted to regain some of their lost face. They didn't come over to the side of the victors until the last few days of the war. Subsequently, although the details about Field Marshall Romel and Field Marshall Montgomery are fascinating, the central story about an Italian lieutenant is irrelevant to history.As other reviewers have noted, the film is a terrible copy. Nonetheless, it is a good view. It brings Romel to life, shows the desert of North Africa, the logistical, communications and support failures that contributed greatest to the battles of North Africa.
