All the characters in this show are profoundly unbelievable.It is understandable that one would would have major problems when first being confronted with the situation in which we find them. But to have been there more than once and still just constantly behaving in a way that goes against all sanity, common sense, and rational survival responses makes no sense to any remotely sane person.Just having endless, pointless, ridiculous discussions while death is imminent and the necessary course of action is often agonizingly obvious. And then dying as a result?. How can this be considered worth watching?I fast forwarded through most all of it once it became painfully apparent what it was like. IT WAS A SERIOUS WASTE OF MONEY and TIME.I have made a few mistakes like this in my quest to find some decent anime that might not just have kiddies but older characters with more mature and thus engaging plots such as, Ghost In The Shell, Urasawas MONSTER, and Death Note, just to name a few. These jewels are far too few.Give me all of season one of BTOOOM over this any day. At least in BTOOOM the characters do learn and apply what they learn as they go along. Looking forward to a second season of BTOOOM actually.I guess that if nothing else it provides a lesson as to some examples of utter stupidity. Or perhaps it was meant to be funny as the viewer(s) laugh at how foolishly the characters behave. Actually there was a bit of that with the egocentric narcissistic ""horny"" boy. BUT how can anyone laugh through the whole series? No that isn't it.All I can think of is that all the money spent on the making of this anime series was to try and keep mentally impaired viewers from making any progress and insuring that they become even more impaired. It just makes no sense. Unbelievably awful.The mystery as to how or why anyone would spend time and money making something like this is confounding.I whole hardheartedly agree with others reviewers her at Amazon and elsewhere who have a similar take about this incredibly bad show.",1,"What can I say.

954240,A3O6E41H4V1TMN,B000C1VB0A,A&M Junkie,"[26, 27]","Gantz is a lot of fun, despite being shockingly rude and gruesome in places. One day on his way back home from school, Kei, our anti-hero sees a tramp fall onto the rail tracks in the Underground station. Despite not wanting to get involved he is pressured into helping a former friend of his to rescue the tramp. Unfortunately it does not go well as he and his friend are torn to shreds by a train. However, instead of dying, they find themselves transported to a strange sealed room filled with people and a black round ball named Gantz. It turns out that each person in the room was in the process of dying when they were all transported to this room, including a suicidal girl, gangster, and school teacher. They have been given a second chance to live provided that they follow the orders given by Gantz.Although it is the thoughts of the main character Kei who we hear it is difficult to call him a ""hero"" as he is so self-absorbed. His thoughts are filled with apathy at the world around him and the people in it. He does not want to get involved with anything or anybody and only helps others when he is forced to by others, by his own guilt, or if he thinks he has something to gain from the situation. His main motivations always seem to be lust-filled and he is constantly mentally undressing his female companions. However, by equal turns he is a very likable character and has refreshingly honest feelings. He friend on the other hand is our moral compass - he goes out of his way to help others and empathizes with the people around him.These two contradicting old friends find themselves forced together again when the strange Gantz machine supplies them with weapons and orders them to kill an alien. And just when you thought the series could not get any stranger, we are greeted with a green onion loving (and looking) alien. What follows is a tension ridden series, full of action, bloody scenes with limbs torn apart, and some graphic nude sequences. It is by turns unpredictable, mysterious, emotionally disturbing, and exciting. The series forces you to ask yourself what you would do in their situation and recalls the feeling of Neon Genesis Evangelion in that we are faced with teenagers who are forced into battles and have to risk their lives unwillingly.The graphics are excellent and are supplied by Gonzo.  The music and dubbing are also very good, with a cast that includes Chris Patton (from Full Metal Panic) and Spike Spencer (from NGE fame). If you enjoyed Paranoia Agent, Neon Genesis, or just want to see a compulsive character-driven action series that does not include robots, you will enjoy this. Due to the content it is recommended for those over 18 years. This complete box set contains the first 13 episodes in a thin-pack set.This may sound silly but this is an anime series that makes you feel ""alive"" and I guarantee that by the end of the series you will not be able to stop yourself singing to the main opening credits song.

It's probably the bloodiest, most disturbing anime out outside of some unmentionable hentai titles. It presents itself as something that will gross you out if it needs to and never goes away from its unflinching look at violence in today's world. Yet on the opposing end, it has a touching story of learning how to band together as a group, and of how one boy must find himself again if he wants to save those dear to him.In this season, it follows a young, irresponsible, pervert of a kid named Kei as he faces death and then GANTZ, the robotic ball that takes charge of the lives of anyone who just so happens to die in its watch. Kei, along with his childhood friend Kato and a somewhat confused young girl named Kishimoto, now finds himself the agent of GANTZ, who charges them, along with any other victim that finds his or her way into the room where GANTZ resides, to hunt down and kill aliens in the city. What follows is a short series of shockingly violent deaths and intense battles for survival. None of the survivors come away normal because of this; yet normal is what they must become, as when GANTZ is through with them the survivors are sent back to live their lives again in wait of the next call from the black ball. Kei must face all the same things, such as school life and basic, everyday tasks, while also finding himself obscenely attached to his fellow GANTZ gamer, Kishimoto. Kato finds himself struggling with the violence of GANTZ. And Kishimoto finds herself alone in a world that has forgotten her. The stark contrast between the violent games of GANTZ and the emotional new lives the characters must live is what makes this series as brilliant as it is.This box set contains volumes one through six of the series, and includes thirteen episodes. Below is a rundown of the volumes:Vol. 1 Game of DeathVol. 2 Kill or Be KilledVol. 3 AftershocksVol. 4 Terminal DispatchVol. 5 Process of EliminationVol. 6 Sudden DeathThe reason for the number of discs is because GANTZ's original release was at a two episode per disc ratio. It left a lot of people angry at the time, but if you were interested in GANTZ yet didn't buy it because of the episode count, then now is the perfect time to get this disturbingly brilliant anime series. If you're a fan of darker anime such as, say, Ninja Scroll, which is the only normal anime I can think of that comes close to the shock-fest that is GANTZ, then GANTZ is definitely for you.",5,Bloody Emotion,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,2483,"['GANTZ', 'strange', 'mix', 'anime', 'probably', 'bloodiest', 'most', 'disturbing', 'anime', 'outside', 'unmentionable', 'hentai', 'titles', 'something', 'will', 'gross', 'never', 'away', 'unflinching', 'look', 'violence', 'today', 'world', 'opposing', 'end', 'touching', 'story', 'learning', 'how', 'band', 'together', 'group', 'how', 'one', 'boy', 'must', 'find', 'again', 'save', 'dear', 'him.In', 'season', 'young', 'irresponsible', 'pervert', 'kid', 'named', 'Kei', 'death', 'then', 'GANTZ', 'robotic', 'ball', 'charge', 'lives', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'die', 'watch', 'Kei', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Kato', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Kishimoto', 'now', 'agent', 'GANTZ', 'who', 'other', 'victim', 'way', 'room', 'where', 'GANTZ', 'hunt', 'down', 'kill', 'aliens', 'city', 'What', 'short', 'series', 'shockingly', 'violent', 'deaths', 'intense', 'battles', 'survival', 'None', 'survivors', 'come', 'away', 'normal', 'normal', 'what', 'must', 'become', 'when', 'GANTZ', 'survivors', 'are', 'sent', 'back', 'live', 'lives', 'again', 'wait', 'next', 'call', 'black', 'ball', 'Kei', 'must', 'face', 'same', 'things', 'such', 'school', 'life', 'basic', 'everyday', 'tasks', 'also', 'finding', 'obscenely', 'attached', 'fellow', 'GANTZ', 'gamer', 'Kishimoto', 'Kato', 'struggling', 'violence', 'GANTZ', 'Kishimoto', 'alone', 'world', 'forgotten', 'stark', 'contrast', 'violent', 'games', 'GANTZ', 'emotional', 'new', 'characters', 'must', 'live', 'what', 'series', 'as', 'brilliant', 'box', 'set', 'volumes', 'one', 'six', 'series', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'Below', 'rundown', 'volumes', 'Vol', '1', 'Game', 'DeathVol', '2', 'Kill', 'Be', 'KilledVol', '3', 'AftershocksVol', '4', 'Terminal', 'DispatchVol', '5', 'Process', 'EliminationVol', '6', 'Sudden', 'DeathThe', 'reason', 'number', 'discs', 'GANTZ', 'original', 'release', 'was', 'two', 'episode', 'disc', 'ratio', 'left', 'lot', 'people', 'angry', 'time', 'were', 'interested', 'GANTZ', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'episode', 'count', 'then', 'now', 'perfect', 'time', 'get', 'disturbingly', 'brilliant', 'anime', 'series', ""'re"", 'fan', 'darker', 'anime', 'such', 'say', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'only', 'normal', 'anime', 'can', 'think', 'close', 'shock-fest', 'GANTZ', 'then', 'GANTZ', 'definitely']",Gantz Season 1

There's long philosophical debates that elongate fight scenes.  However, if you can make it to the end it's an amazing story that is well thought out (even though the ending of the series leaves much to be desired - apparently the manga has not ended so I'm curious if the anime will be extended).The animation is extremely graphic in violence and has nudity so it's definitely designed for adults (18+) though the main charaacters are in high school.  Which is a little weird because there's a bit of perverse/immature scenarios that would be more intended for a younger audience - so the tone doesn't quite match.  However, that's not the main core of the series.  It deals with some powerful and important themes - standing up for yourself, fighting for what you believe in, and self discovery.If you want something that is a non-stop ride, do not get this.  If you want something deeper, meditative and can wait for a longer resolution, this may interest you.  If you liked Blood the Last Vampire anime - you'll dig this.

The elements are all there for a fascinating and action-packed anime season, but the season is ruined by a combination of terrible pacing and poor execution.""Gantz"" centers around the character Kei Kurono, a deeply flawed and sexually frustrated teenage boy who, in the process of helping old friend Kato save someone's life, is killed in a train accident - or so he thinks. Instead of death, Kurono and Kato find themselves in a room with a strange being known as Gantz, who has summoned them (along with others who have died) to carry out missions to hunt aliens.This is a brutal series to watch. The anime is not hesitant to kill characters who we come to understand and appreciate at the drop of a hat, in an absolutely gut-wrenching manner. The horror and confusion of the main characters is shockingly realistic much of the time, and the show does a good job of capturing the chaos of the situation that is its premise. It's much too easy to insert yourself for comfort.Unfortunately, this series is bedeviled with two problems: Pacing, and a ""Filler"" ending. ""Gantz"" has downright HORRIBLE pacing, particularly after the first four episodes; it frequently slows to an absolute crawl for uninteresting and usually irrelevant dialogue. This subverts much of the shock value in the earlier part of the series, and made it very difficult to finish the series.The ""filler"" ending (an ending made up specifically for the anime, since the series overtook the manga) is horrible as well (although mercifully limited to the last two episodes). It comes out of nowhere, irrelevant and unrelated to what came before in the story, and even ends on an uncertain note (plagiarizing the vague ending of Cowboy Bebop, with the main character's fate uncertain).I regretfully urge you to avoid this anime (although not the manga series, which stays interesting in spite of some bizarre twists and turns in the story).",2,Interesting and unusual idea ruined by terrible pacing and execution,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,2073,"['Gantz', 'highly', 'unusual', 'anime', 'manga', 'unique', 'combination', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'graphic', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'flawed', 'characters', 'science', 'fiction', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'fascinating', 'action-packed', 'anime', 'season', 'season', 'ruined', 'combination', 'terrible', 'pacing', 'poor', 'execution', 'Gantz', 'centers', 'character', 'Kei', 'Kurono', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'process', 'helping', 'old', 'friend', 'Kato', 'save', 'someone', 'life', 'killed', 'train', 'accident', 'so', 'Instead', 'death', 'Kurono', 'Kato', 'find', 'room', 'strange', 'being', 'known', 'Gantz', 'who', 'summoned', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'carry', 'out', 'missions', 'hunt', 'aliens.This', 'brutal', 'series', 'watch', 'anime', 'not', 'hesitant', 'kill', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'drop', 'hat', 'absolutely', 'gut-wrenching', 'manner', 'horror', 'confusion', 'main', 'characters', 'shockingly', 'realistic', 'much', 'time', 'show', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'chaos', 'situation', 'premise', 'much', 'too', 'easy', 'insert', 'comfort.Unfortunately', 'series', 'bedeviled', 'two', 'problems', 'Pacing', 'Filler', 'ending', 'Gantz', 'downright', 'HORRIBLE', 'pacing', 'particularly', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'frequently', 'absolute', 'crawl', 'uninteresting', 'usually', 'irrelevant', 'dialogue', 'much', 'shock', 'value', 'earlier', 'part', 'series', 'made', 'very', 'difficult', 'finish', 'series.The', 'filler', 'ending', 'ending', 'made', 'up', 'specifically', 'anime', 'series', 'overtook', 'manga', 'horrible', 'as', 'well', 'mercifully', 'limited', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'nowhere', 'irrelevant', 'unrelated', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'story', 'even', 'uncertain', 'note', 'plagiarizing', 'vague', 'ending', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'main', 'character', 'fate', 'uncertain', 'regretfully', 'urge', 'avoid', 'anime', 'not', 'manga', 'series', 'interesting', 'spite', 'bizarre', 'twists', 'turns', 'story']",Gantz Season 1

But some action animes don't cut it for me *Trigun, hellsing, and so on* But then you have a action + story + characters. You don't get all three usually, most times two and since 2004 it seeems even more so your lucky to get even one of those traits. BUT this anime, gantz, In my honest opinion is one of the best action animes with a great story and very interesting characters.First let's start off with the story. It's like a game but a bigger penalty then a ""Game over... Continue?"" screen. Best part is to actually begin playing this ""Game"" you'll have to die first. Yes you read right ""DIE FIRST"" and only THEN you'll be able to enter the game runned by a black ball. It's very interesting and sadly while the anime does get the first three arcs it only gets better so you'll have to begin to read the manga after.Next is the characters. The main character, Kei, is the biggest P***y ever. Seriously he'll let you die as long as he'll be ok even though he could of saved you. He's also a loser and even gets caught in class with a boner. Yes this is the definition of a true loser. But as you watch this anime you'll see him change and not to mention the side characters are all good and very convincing.Action is ace. blood? Check.

I must say after watching all the episodes, I was mildly impressed. Animation is top notch, pretty darn good if say so myself, but that script..man...horrible. It almost seems as if a little kid wrote the script and gave to some adults...not impressed there, voice acting was bearable in Japanese, but in English! Do yourself a favor and watch it in Japanese with subs...you'd enjoy it more that way...Not raggin' on the voice actors (love Chris Patton btw) but it seems the script they had to work with wasn't that much better than the Japanese ones..in fact it's worse!

954246,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B000C1VB0A,Eric J. Anderson,"[4, 11]","This program is evil. It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz, because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters, who have all died, find themselves in. They have gone to purgatory, and purgatory is like an all-too-real video game. One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries.The art direction is decent. Visually, it doesn't look cheap. The English voice acting is embarassingly bad, especially the main character, but not as bad as the dialogue, internal and vocalized, that this character has been given to speak.The worst thing about this series, apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners, is the ""action"" scenes. These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do, when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands, and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow. After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video, if you don't feel like banging your head against the wall, you are made of stronger stuff than I.This first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and more frustration than satisfaction.

I went out and did a lot of research, including using this site, to decide whether it was worth my time and money.  Sadly, it was not worth either.As stories go, Gantz has a good one.  People being 'saved' from death by a mysterious orb and then being forced to fight to live one more day is a compelling plot.  The initial characters even have great backgrounds that run from self-absorbed loner to do-gooder.The problems with Gantz start to come out once the characters have all been killed.  The main character becomes a horny, whiner who's only motivation is to sleep with the girl with a larger then life chest.  The girl spends all her time worrying about the do-gooder and the do-gooder is too obsessed with keeping everyone alive, and he gets people killed by doing nothing.You've now been told bascially all of the character development you will find in this series.  What you're really after is the fight sequences.  Unfortunately, these boil down to the characters spending half their time arguing and the other half whining about not wanting to die.  In the end you have a gun fight lasting multiple episodes, helped by the fact that the first 2 minutes of every episode is a rehash of the end of the previous one.  Characters die in mere seconds and then the survivors spend up to 5 minutes staring in shock and saying 'this can't be happening!'The English voices of the characters are passable, except the main one.  His whiny attitude is enhanced by a squeaky, childish voice.  The art is very well done, the computer generated sequences aren't overbearing, and the music is unobtrusive.Overall, the show is quite beautiful to watch except that the story falls very short.  This entire series(season 1 and 2) could've easily been compressed into a 2 hour film, and it would've been much easier to stomach.Lastly, there are some major warnings here to anyone considering letting kids watch this with them.  There are multiple sex scenes, all involving the underage(he is 16) main character and other underage characters.  There is also quite a bit of very graphic violence, including decapitations, dismemberment and the like.

Some characters are good, some scumbags, and others fight within themselves between doing what is right or just looking out for themselves. Very realistic. The story is bugged out but in a good way.

954250,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B000C1VB0A,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[2, 3]","Gantz is probably one of the best anime I've watched this year, not the best but it's up there. I don't know where to start but I think I'll try to explain what Gantz is all about first. Gantz is a sphere located in an apartment. The only thing people recognize is Tokyo tower right outside the window. Gantz has a mind of its own but no conscience or feelings. The sphere has a huge arsenal of futuristic weapons that pop out of it including special suits. It also holds a man who looks like he's on life support inside of it; he resembles the crazy old man in the film Saw 3. It's not said if the man is of any importance in the first season cause he never moves or talks but maybe some info will be given in the second season.Gantz collects people right after they've died on earth but only a select few. When the people get to the room Gantz informs them that their lives have ended with the words written on the black surface of the sphere. Gantz also writes ""what you do with your new lives is entirely up to me"". And they begin to play a game for their lives but who knows if it ever ends. The objective is to kill a bunch of insane aliens that Gantz finds or picks out, who knows how it finds them but it does.The story's main character is Kei Kurono but he is far from anyone's hero and really only cares about himself. As a matter of fact Kei spends a lot of time in the series trying to lose something, ""If you know what I mean""? Kei runs into his old friend Kato in the subway but their conversation is cut short when a man falls on the tracks. Kato immediately wants to help the man and asks for Kei's help, it takes a few minutes for Kei to stop being selfish and help the man. The two help get the man off the tracks but end up putting themselves into danger and well let's just say that's when the anime starts to get a little messy.Not every anime is perfect and I had some problems this first season. I think Gantz is amazing but it does have some problems that maybe could have been avoided. For one like a lot of people said it does have bad pacing. Gantz will spend unneeded minutes on conversations and even battles. A character could be getting ready to shoot the alien but takes 5 minutes to think about things like the past. Another problem is that for some reason the weapons are too complicated for these guys and it takes a number of episodes before anyone gets trigger-happy. The story also takes a little too long to develop for every episode. It's hard to realize in the middle the series if it's still one that has puzzle pieces in each episode that add up at the end or if the other episodes meant nothing at all. The main reason for those problems can most likely be chalked up to this anime being made while the Manga was still in its early stages.No matter what even through the bad pacing something about Gantz is addicting and I think it's mostly the unique and edgy style it has. Kei is a great main character because he actually grows up with the series and even looks like he'll turn into one of the best players. Plus it has an ability to intrigue you; you want to know what's going to happen to Kei and Kato. You want to know what happens to the other characters that actually made it through Gantz's firsts stages. The voice acting is great and so is the music, which fits perfect for the Gantz style. The animation is very cool and is actually one of the things that attracted me to the series most. I think the first season is a perfect 4 stars because no matter the flaws it still holds you and makes you hunger for season 2.",4,It's Game Time,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,3572,"['Gantz', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'year', 'not', 'best', 'up', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'start', 'think', ""'ll"", 'try', 'explain', 'what', 'Gantz', 'first', 'Gantz', 'sphere', 'located', 'apartment', 'only', 'thing', 'people', 'recognize', 'Tokyo', 'tower', 'right', 'window', 'Gantz', 'mind', 'own', 'conscience', 'feelings', 'sphere', 'huge', 'arsenal', 'futuristic', 'weapons', 'pop', 'including', 'special', 'suits', 'also', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'support', 'crazy', 'old', 'man', 'film', 'Saw', '3', 'not', 'said', 'man', 'importance', 'first', 'season', 'cause', 'never', 'talks', 'maybe', 'info', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'second', 'season.Gantz', 'collects', 'people', 'right', ""'ve"", 'died', 'earth', 'only', 'select', 'few', 'When', 'people', 'get', 'room', 'Gantz', 'lives', 'have', 'ended', 'words', 'written', 'black', 'surface', 'sphere', 'Gantz', 'also', 'what', 'do', 'new', 'lives', 'entirely', 'begin', 'play', 'game', 'lives', 'who', 'ever', 'objective', 'kill', 'bunch', 'insane', 'aliens', 'Gantz', 'out', 'who', 'how', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'Kei', 'Kurono', 'far', 'anyone', 'hero', 'really', 'only', 'matter', 'fact', 'Kei', 'lot', 'time', 'series', 'trying', 'lose', 'something', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Kei', 'old', 'friend', 'Kato', 'subway', 'conversation', 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'man', 'tracks', 'Kato', 'immediately', 'help', 'man', 'Kei', 'help', 'few', 'minutes', 'Kei', 'stop', 'being', 'selfish', 'help', 'man', 'two', 'help', 'get', 'man', 'tracks', 'end', 'up', 'putting', 'danger', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'when', 'anime', 'get', 'little', 'messy.Not', 'anime', 'perfect', 'had', 'problems', 'first', 'season', 'think', 'Gantz', 'amazing', 'have', 'problems', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'one', 'lot', 'people', 'said', 'have', 'bad', 'pacing', 'Gantz', 'will', 'spend', 'unneeded', 'minutes', 'conversations', 'even', 'battles', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'getting', 'ready', 'shoot', 'alien', '5', 'minutes', 'think', 'things', 'past', 'problem', 'reason', 'weapons', 'are', 'too', 'complicated', 'guys', 'number', 'episodes', 'anyone', 'trigger-happy', 'story', 'also', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'develop', 'episode', 'hard', 'realize', 'middle', 'series', 'still', 'one', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'episode', 'up', 'end', 'other', 'episodes', 'meant', 'nothing', 'main', 'reason', 'problems', 'can', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'anime', 'being', 'made', 'Manga', 'was', 'still', 'early', 'stages.No', 'matter', 'what', 'even', 'bad', 'pacing', 'something', 'Gantz', 'addicting', 'think', 'mostly', 'unique', 'edgy', 'style', 'Kei', 'great', 'main', 'character', 'actually', 'up', 'series', 'even', ""'ll"", 'turn', 'one', 'best', 'players', 'ability', 'intrigue', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Kei', 'Kato', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'other', 'characters', 'actually', 'made', 'Gantz', 'firsts', 'stages', 'voice', 'acting', 'great', 'so', 'music', 'perfect', 'Gantz', 'style', 'animation', 'very', 'cool', 'actually', 'one', 'things', 'attracted', 'series', 'most', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'perfect', '4', 'stars', 'matter', 'flaws', 'still', 'hunger', 'season', '2']",Gantz Season 1

What really marks the series though is it's characters. Sure, some of them are stereotypical. For the most part though, they are interesting. Kei is obsessed with sex, which is funny. Still, there are so many instances where he steps up. I think the end of episode 6 is perfectly done, as the animation and music coincide perfectly. Also, we get a glimpse of how the characters are evolving. What's more interesting is the way in which new characters are brought in. In episode 7, we are introduced to many characters. They are introduced through their interactions around Kei, but they aren't in direct contact with Kei. Somehow, the creators of the show were able to introduce so many characters and still have them be relevant to the show.

A good story, good voice acting and did I mention action?3) There is some nice animation here. You can tell the production values were pretty high for this series.4) What's it about? Well, that's a tough one. There is this big black metal ball in this empty room that teleports the recently dead to it. They are ""alive"" and have to kill aliens or be killed. The ball provides a protective costume and a gun to each, if they can figure it out and don't kill each other, they get to go back and live again for a while. Until the next time Gantz (the ball) calls themOh, also there is someone inside Gantz. Which leads to....The Bad1) Lots of unanswered questions. WAY too many.

954256,A2DMEJI0Z0H99J,B000C1VB0A,Scott Promish,"[1, 2]","In GANTZ, several individuals from various walks of life, who have each met with an untimely demise, find themselves resurrected in a Tokyo apartment that is empty except for a mysterious large black sphere.  As they are trying to sort out their confusion, the sphere opens, revealing combat suits and advanced weaponry.  They are then transported to a kind of twilight Tokyo where they cannot be seen (though their physical effects can be felt) and instructed to kill a series of increasingly bizarre and deadly ""aliens"" which exist in the city.The story primarily revolves around three characters: Kei and Kato, two schoolmates who are run down by a subway train after they save a homeless man from the same fate, and a young woman named Kei as well, a suicide.  Also important to the earlier missions is Nishi, a veteran of the ""games"" who lords his experience over the others, but is willing to share information when it suits him.This series is paced very badly and it really suffers for it.  There is an extraordinary amount of padding, so much that I estimate it could have been told in half as many episodes if it was laid out better.  There are far too many scenes where characters stand around arguing, delivering the same dialogue back and forth endlessly.  When battles are in progress, too, characters often do nothing, and this inaction results in the needless deaths of many team members.  There is no character development going on in these scenes.  It's pointless and extremely frustrating.If I hadn't been so curious to find out what Gantz was and why it was doing all this, I likely would have quit after the first couple volumes.  As it turns out, neither we nor the players ever learn any more about their situation than they knew in the beginning.  After putting us through twenty-some episodes, that's unforgivable.  It's sad to see such an interesting idea executed so poorly.  Visually the show looks quite nice.  It just goes nowhere.",3,"""No labyrinth is inescapable.""",1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,1960,"['GANTZ', 'several', 'individuals', 'various', 'walks', 'life', 'who', 'have', 'met', 'untimely', 'demise', 'find', 'resurrected', 'Tokyo', 'apartment', 'empty', 'mysterious', 'large', 'black', 'sphere', 'are', 'trying', 'sort', 'out', 'confusion', 'sphere', 'opens', 'revealing', 'combat', 'suits', 'advanced', 'weaponry', 'are', 'then', 'transported', 'kind', 'twilight', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'physical', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'instructed', 'kill', 'series', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'deadly', 'aliens', 'exist', 'city.The', 'story', 'primarily', 'around', 'three', 'characters', 'Kei', 'Kato', 'two', 'schoolmates', 'who', 'are', 'run', 'down', 'subway', 'train', 'save', 'homeless', 'man', 'same', 'fate', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Kei', 'as', 'well', 'suicide', 'Also', 'important', 'earlier', 'missions', 'Nishi', 'veteran', 'games', 'who', 'lords', 'experience', 'others', 'willing', 'share', 'information', 'when', 'suits', 'him.This', 'series', 'paced', 'very', 'badly', 'really', 'extraordinary', 'amount', 'padding', 'so', 'much', 'estimate', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'half', 'many', 'episodes', 'was', 'laid', 'out', 'better', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'stand', 'arguing', 'delivering', 'same', 'dialogue', 'back', 'forth', 'endlessly', 'When', 'battles', 'are', 'progress', 'too', 'characters', 'often', 'do', 'nothing', 'inaction', 'results', 'needless', 'deaths', 'many', 'team', 'members', 'character', 'development', 'going', 'scenes', 'pointless', 'extremely', 'frustrating.If', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'curious', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Gantz', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'doing', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'quit', 'first', 'couple', 'volumes', 'out', 'players', 'ever', 'learn', 'more', 'situation', 'knew', 'beginning', 'putting', 'twenty-some', 'episodes', 'unforgivable', 'sad', 'see', 'such', 'interesting', 'idea', 'executed', 'so', 'poorly', 'Visually', 'show', 'quite', 'nice', 'just', 'nowhere']",Gantz Season 1

Upon getting through the first 6 or so episodes, I could not stop watching! It was almost painful to stop watching it. I related so much with the characters and their struggles (even though mine are not so adventurous) that I could not help identifying and truly being there with them until the end...
