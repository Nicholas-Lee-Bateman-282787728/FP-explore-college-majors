I bought this mostly on the strength of Mathew Montgomery being in the cast.  I wish I had read the reviews first.This movie goes in so many wrong, clumsy directions, that it's hard to get a handle on it.  It tries to take place in some absurd realm like a John Waters film, it tries to be silly like a Pee Wee Herman film, it tries to be stumblingly funny like a Jerry Lewis film, and to be in the conventional world as well.  It does NONE of this effectively.  It is miserable.  I felt uncomfortable for the decent actors who were in this.  It was so bad that it rivals ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", except that it can't even be unintentionally funny.And WHY in the world is there a drag queen sound track and theme throughout this film?  Take the worst drag queen portrayal you can imagine, combined with being strung-out, singing a slightly twisted version of ""Is That All There Is?"" because the producers wouldn't pay royalties to use the actual song, and you begin to get an idea of this miasma of a cheap film with little aspirations of being either cinema or parody.I only wish that I had the time I've spent on this movie back.  Move along.  Nothing to see here.

1504196,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B005VAB73S,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[7, 8]","Playing against his usual ""type"" in gay films, Matthew Montgomery is Paul, a nerdy, fastidious gay man who has friends, a nice home, and his own ad agency, but no partner with whom to share it.  After attending a lesbian wedding, and knowing that Prop 8 was on the horizon to stop same-sex marriages, Paul embarks on a misguided, frantic journey through speed dating, meeting guys through the internet (And, no, ""FF"" does not mean he's into fly fishing!) and trying way too hard to impress.Meanwhile, Paul's well-to-do parents had a fight, and his mother (who is more than a bit naive and recently donated a large sum of money to the Prop 8 campaign, because the kids in their commercial were cute), gets stranded for a time in a trucker's casino in the desert, where she hangs out with a drag queen.  Paul's father goes chasing after his wife, but manages to get carjacked and roans the desert without his pants.  And Paul has a big decision to make as to whether to take on a client who is involved in pushing through Prop 8.I wish I could recommend this, as it does have its cute moments, but it is largely a muddled, overdone and unrealistic slapstick mess.  Montgomery makes the transition from unrecognizable to annoying, with exaggerated facial expressions throughout.  Director Billy Clift brings along Matthew Martin, who played the lead in his 2010 ""Baby Jane"" film, and her drag presence in this film is much overdone. Some minor sound problems and editing snafus are also evident, and this could have been a much better film if he cut about 20 minutes from its 120 minute run time, which would helpfully make it more cohesive.  As is, I can give it just three stars out of five.",3,"Had promise, but this is mostly a muddled mess.",1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,1690,"['Playing', 'usual', 'type', 'gay', 'films', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery', 'Paul', 'nerdy', 'fastidious', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'friends', 'nice', 'home', 'own', 'ad', 'agency', 'partner', 'whom', 'share', 'attending', 'lesbian', 'wedding', 'knowing', 'Prop', '8', 'was', 'horizon', 'stop', 'same-sex', 'marriages', 'Paul', 'misguided', 'frantic', 'journey', 'speed', 'dating', 'meeting', 'guys', 'internet', 'FF', 'not', 'mean', 'fly', 'fishing', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'impress.Meanwhile', 'Paul', 'well-to-do', 'parents', 'had', 'fight', 'mother', 'who', 'more', 'bit', 'naive', 'recently', 'donated', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'Prop', '8', 'campaign', 'kids', 'commercial', 'were', 'cute', 'stranded', 'time', 'trucker', 'casino', 'desert', 'where', 'out', 'drag', 'queen', 'Paul', 'father', 'chasing', 'wife', 'get', 'carjacked', 'desert', 'pants', 'Paul', 'big', 'decision', 'make', 'take', 'client', 'who', 'involved', 'pushing', 'Prop', '8.I', 'wish', 'could', 'recommend', 'have', 'cute', 'moments', 'largely', 'muddled', 'overdone', 'unrealistic', 'slapstick', 'mess', 'Montgomery', 'transition', 'unrecognizable', 'annoying', 'exaggerated', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Director', 'Billy', 'Clift', 'along', 'Matthew', 'Martin', 'who', 'played', 'lead', '2010', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'film', 'drag', 'presence', 'film', 'much', 'overdone', 'minor', 'sound', 'problems', 'editing', 'snafus', 'are', 'also', 'evident', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'cut', 'about', '20', 'minutes', '120', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'would', 'helpfully', 'make', 'more', 'cohesive', 'can', 'give', 'just', 'three', 'stars', 'five']",I Want to Get Married

It's not one of the best gay romantic comedies, though. It is charming, and has gay faves Matthew Montgomery and Peter Stickles kissing a lot.

But, in this film he was horribly miscast and / or mis-directed. His over-acting a la Jerry Lewis and his endless facial mugging were just too much. Mind you, this whole film is a loser. The screenplay is all over the place and the film has no center. It goes off in a bunch of unsatisfying directions : romance, slapstick comedy, political, and more. Very little is believable, even when we are supposed to be serious.Most of the characters are either caricatures or downright unpleasant. The drag performer who sings the same song poorly over and over and who waxes philosophically got old in the very first minutes but then went on to be a major character in the film.

I have NEVER been agreat fan of Matthew Montgomery. And despite 15 film roles, for me hehas never improved past the point of being an ""average"" actor. That,and his appearance, as much as anything. There has always beensomething a little bit ""Ratso Rizzo"" (for want of a kinder description)about his facial characteristics. So there...now you know how shallowI am.At last...let's briefly get to the movie, itself. And by the way, itis a film story of several subplots; in no way does it particularlyconcentrate on Matthew's character and his idiotic attempts to land thecute man of the cover. Playing an extremely unattractive Super-Geek,the best that Montgomery can bring to the role is aclinching...compressing...contortion of his lips and mouth (and, ofcourse, the supposed-to-be nerdish, black frame glasses). The mouthexercising QUICKLY gets very old...at the same time making it quitedifficult to understand our lead. Worse, this is compounded by one ofthe most terribly recorded soundtracks I have heard in years. I cannotsay enough bad about the original sound-man's work on this film....BUT,Breaking Glass features should be especially ashamed to have their nameattached to such a poor sound release.Finally, it may interest you that, out of the film's near 120 minuterunning time, Matthew and his bride-to-be (or is it the other wayaround) are TOGETHER for no more than an amazing 20 minutes of screentime. Leaves a lot to be gotten done in those oh-so-interestingsubplots.My very best advice for you: SAVE YOUR MONEY.",2,Don't Let The Cute Cover Suck You In....,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1677,"['.Cause', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'what', 'think', 'gon', 'na', 'be', '2-STARS', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Rating', 'So', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'here', 'have', 'NEVER', 'been', 'agreat', 'fan', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery', '15', 'film', 'roles', 'hehas', 'never', 'improved', 'point', 'being', 'average', 'actor', 'appearance', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'always', 'beensomething', 'little', 'bit', 'Ratso', 'Rizzo', 'want', 'kinder', 'description', 'facial', 'characteristics', 'So', 'now', 'know', 'how', 'shallowI', 'am.At', 'last', 'let', 'briefly', 'get', 'movie', 'way', 'itis', 'film', 'story', 'several', 'subplots', 'way', 'particularlyconcentrate', 'Matthew', 'character', 'idiotic', 'attempts', 'land', 'thecute', 'man', 'cover', 'Playing', 'extremely', 'unattractive', 'Super-Geek', 'best', 'Montgomery', 'can', 'bring', 'role', 'aclinching', 'compressing', 'contortion', 'lips', 'mouth', 'ofcourse', 'supposed-to-be', 'nerdish', 'black', 'frame', 'glasses', 'mouthexercising', 'QUICKLY', 'very', 'old', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'quitedifficult', 'understand', 'lead', 'Worse', 'compounded', 'one', 'ofthe', 'most', 'terribly', 'recorded', 'soundtracks', 'have', 'heard', 'years', 'cannotsay', 'enough', 'bad', 'original', 'sound-man', 'work', 'film', '.BUT', 'Breaking', 'Glass', 'features', 'should', 'be', 'especially', 'ashamed', 'have', 'nameattached', 'such', 'poor', 'sound', 'release.Finally', 'may', 'interest', 'film', '120', 'minuterunning', 'time', 'Matthew', 'bride-to-be', 'other', 'wayaround', 'are', 'TOGETHER', 'more', 'amazing', '20', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'lot', 'be', 'gotten', 'done', 'oh-so-interestingsubplots.My', 'very', 'best', 'advice', 'SAVE', 'YOUR', 'MONEY']",I Want to Get Married
