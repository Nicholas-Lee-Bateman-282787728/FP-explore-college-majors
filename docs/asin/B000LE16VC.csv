1039006,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000LE16VC,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","Hawaii Five-O, First SeasonThis long-running series was famous for its high-energy theme song. Some said it symbolized the energy and excitement of surfing (invented in Hawaii). It was filmed entirely on location in Hawaii, a pioneering event for television. The first show had different actors for the ""Governor"" and ""Danny Williams"". In this series ""Steve McGarrett"" is the head of the State Police, called ""Five-O"", and now a code word. You would think a high-level official would spend time on administration duties (paper work) and politics. Instead he is involved with low-level activities like a small town police chief. But Hollywood provides entertainment and drama, not realistic history. I noticed a range of quality in these stories from different writers. Many of these stories could have been located in Los Angeles or Las Vega. This series went on for twelve seasons with much of the original cast. McGarrett is often shows with anger-management problems.The ""Pilot"" was a two-hour television movie. The idea of Red Chinese agents spying in Hawaii was often used until the mid 1970s. A form of political brainwashing? Wasn't that ""cocoon"" invented at a US university from federal funding in the 1960s? The villains are stymied or caught in the end.""Full Fathom Five"" involves a scheme to marry and kill wealthy widows for their money. This story about a blue-beard ends in a shoot-out.""Strangers in Our Own Land"" is about the land development that harms people. The story about an assassination recorded on a movie camera and the death of a `patsy' recalls the 1960s.""Tiger by the Tail"" is about the kidnapping of a singer in a nightclub. Will they collect a big reward? Was this based on a true crime from the 1960s?""Samurai"" involves organized crime and an assassination. A sniper on a grassy knoll shoots. Do some scenes recall a Hitchcock movie? Could a WW II Japanese naval officer live in Hawaii for many years?""And They Painted Daisies On His Coffin"" involves stolen auto parts that are traded for drugs. The investigation clears Danny Williams from a shooting charge.""Twenty-Four Karat Kill"" is about smuggling gold into Hawaii. McGarrett ends this racket. [Owning gold was illegal at this time.]""The Ways of Love"" is about burglary where a portable X-ray machine is used to detect the lock combination on a safe. McGarrett solves the crime.""No Blue Skies"" is about smuggling that involves a singer. Does a young woman know too much and has to be silenced?""By the Numbers"" involves soldiers from Vietnam who go to Hawaii to meet their wives. There is gambling and crime here.""Yesterday Died and Tomorrow Won't Be Born"" is a message movie that argues for the 1968 Gun Control law. A discharged veteran seeks revenge on those who helped to convict him.""Deathwatch"" involves the assassination of a prosecutor and the theft of evidence from his safe. If the thief is murdered how will they track the man who ordered this crime?""Pray Love Remember"" involves a Cultural Institution that aids small nations. A young woman was strangled. Was it her boyfriend or a thief who left no witnesses?""King of the Hill"" is about a wounded veteran who imagines he is back in combat. Can Danny be saved through a peaceful solution?""Up-Tight"" involves a professor who encourages students to use mind-altering drugs. One student's father seeks poetic justice. Then we see the same location as in the beginning.""Face of the Dragon"" has the unusual story of an outbreak of bubonic plague! Was it caused by a Red Chinese spy? Can McGarrett catch this agent and end ""Asian flu""?""The Box"" tells about a prison revolt that captures hostages. McGarrett convinces them to get their demands printed in the newspaper. This ends the revolt.""One for the Money"" is about murders committed for an inheritance. McGarrett figures it out and catches the murderer.""Along Came Joey"" is about a boxing match that may be fixed. McGarrett solves the crime. [Does it remind you of ""On The Waterfront""?]""Once Upon a Time"" has two parts. It involves medical treatments that are not scientifically proven. Can this quack be stopped and jailed? There are emotional involvements for McGarrett. There is a very dramatic courtroom scene that exposes the fraud. [Remember diathermy machines?]""Not That Much Different"" is about a shooting at a peace demonstration. Who did it? And why? McGarrett says arms are needed for protection. McGarrett gets a confession from the murderer.""Six Kilos"" is about a team organized to burglarize a safe that is guarded on a yacht. It succeeds, then fails. McGarrett catches the secret organizer for a surprise ending.""The Big Kahuna"" involves an attempt to inherit valuable property by creating an hallucination for a wealthy old man. Can McGarrett arrive in time to save Sam. [Was this story unintentionally funny?]There is a documentary about this show on the Disc Seven DVD. It bought publicity and tourists to Hawaii. Local actors were used, even if little experienced. Jack Lord was a perfectionist. ""Hawaii Five-O"" is seen around the world in syndication today.",4,The Beginning,1314230400,"08 25, 2011",2011,5072,"['Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'First', 'SeasonThis', 'long-running', 'series', 'was',

1039009,A1A4R6PU3QYVJ5,B000LE16VC,"Amazon Customer ""Serious Reader""","[4, 4]","Until I purchased this, I had never seen the pilot episode of ""Hawaii Five-O"".  Nor do I remember any of the other episodes featured in this set.  The show premiered just two years before I was born, and by the time that started watching it, it was already getting long in the tooth.That being said, ""Hawaii Five-O"" was one of my favorite shows growing up, and to see how well the boys at CBS DVD and CBS Paramount Television pulled off the transfer to DVD is just touching.  It's a trip back in time to see not only the original Five-O gang (which included an actor named Tim O'Kelley as the first Danno and veteran actors Philip Ahn and Lew Ayers as the attorney general and governor, respectively), but to also see others who are now known as stars.  That includes Leslie Nielsen, Gavin McLeod and the late Ed Flanders, who appears in an episode in which art virtually imitated his tragic end in real life.Back to ""Cocoon"", the pilot episode--virtually every iconic image associated with ""Hawaii Five-O"" appears in the original opening, which is preserved here.  That includes the famed wave, the 707 passing over the light towers on final approach to Honolulu International Airport, the hula dancer (whose face is seen in the pilot), and Lady Columbia, the statue at the National Cemetery in Punchbowl Crater.  Of course, the post-pilot episodes include the better known opening sequence and the original closing sequence, riding the back of a Honolulu police motorcycle down the street with the blue light flashing.This was a treat for me to be able to see many of these episodes for the first time.  Who needs ""Law & Order"", when you've got quality acting, top-shelf directing and plenty of action in one of the most beautiful places on Earth?  I'm looking forward to picking up all the future seasons of this great crime drama!",5,"For ""Cocoon"" Alone, It's Worth The Money",1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,1834,"['purchased', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'do', 'remember', 'other', 'episodes', 'featured', 'set', 'show', 'premiered', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'was', 'born', 'time', 'started', 'watching', 'was', 'already', 'getting', 'long', 'tooth.That', 'being', 'said', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'growing', 'up', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'boys', 'CBS', 'DVD', 'CBS', 'Paramount', 'Television', 'pulled', 'off', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'just', 'touching', 'trip', 'back', 'time', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'original', 'Five-O', 'gang', 'included', 'actor', 'named', 'Tim', ""O'Kelley"", 'first', 'Danno', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Philip', 'Ahn', 'Lew', 'Ayers', 'attorney', 'general', 'governor', 'respectively', 'also', 'see', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'known', 'stars', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Gavin', 'McLeod', 'late', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'who', 'episode', 'art', 'virtually', 'imitated', 'tragic', 'end', 'real', 'life.Back', 'Cocoon', 'pilot', 'episode', 'virtually', 'iconic', 'image', 'associated', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'original', 'opening', 'preserved', 'here', 'famed', 'wave', '707', 'passing', 'light', 'towers', 'final', 'approach', 'Honolulu', 'International', 'Airport', 'hula', 'dancer', 'face', 'seen', 'pilot', 'Lady', 'Columbia', 'statue', 'National', 'Cemetery', 'Punchbowl', 'Crater', 'course', 'post-pilot', 'episodes', 'include', 'better', 'known', 'opening', 'sequence', 'original', 'closing', 'sequence', 'riding', 'back', 'Honolulu', 'police', 'motorcycle', 'street', 'blue', 'light', 'flashing.This', 'was', 'treat', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'many', 'episodes', 'first', 'time', 'Who', 'Law', 'Order', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'quality', 'acting', 'top-shelf', 'directing', 'plenty', 'action', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'places', 'Earth', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'picking', 'up', 'future', 'seasons', 'great', 'crime', 'drama']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 1

1039016,AMX6OVOXFDL5Q,B000LE16VC,Ben Masters,"[2, 2]","My mother bought this for me from the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Simpsonville. I decided to try it out, starting with the pilot, a.k.a. ""Cocoon."" That pilot, by the time I got through with it, was 97 minutes well spent, at least as far as pilot films go. All the other episodes (from ""Full Fathom Five"" all the way through ""The Big Kahuna"")  also held my complete and undivided interest all the way through. The color in this first season of ""Five-O"" is superb-- there aren't any dropouts, no pixelation, nada. It's just smooth sailing all the way through to the checkered flag. The menus (when I want to get to a specific outing) are easily navigable and are very well-designed to boot. The opening and closing themes of season 1 (matter-of-factly, of the series as a whole) stand as some of television's greatest music (this can be said of the pilot as well, and also the music within the stories). The opening and closing titles are some of television's greatest (the closing credits even included a longer version of the strobing police light from the opening). The season's 7 discs are superbly packaged as well. I even enjoyed seeing the 1996 documentary w/Emme Tomimbang and James MacArthur. Finally, the characters (from McGarrett through to Chin Ho and the weekly guest stars), the settings (the Iolani Palace and the entire state of Hawaii), and the stories (straight-up crime dramas of the late-'60's)-- all combine to make the first season's worth of ""Hawaii Five-O"" a must-buy. If you're looking for a great series to put in your television disc collection (especially if you're just starting), pass by ""Friends"", ""Seinfeld"", and ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", ignore them, and go right to ""Five-O.""",5,"""Hawaii Five-O"" S1",1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,1705,"['mother', 'bought', 'Wal-Mart', 'Supercenter', 'Simpsonville', 'decided', 'try', 'out', 'starting', 'pilot', 'a.k.a', 'Cocoon', 'pilot', 'time', 'got', 'was', '97', 'minutes', 'well', 'spent', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'pilot', 'films', 'go', 'other', 'episodes', 'Full', 'Fathom', 'Five', 'way', 'Big', 'Kahuna', 'also', 'held', 'complete', 'undivided', 'interest', 'way', 'color', 'first', 'season', 'Five-O', 'superb', 'are', ""n't"", 'dropouts', 'pixelation', 'nada', 'just', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'way', 'checkered', 'flag', 'menus', 'when', 'want', 'get', 'specific', 'outing', 'are', 'easily', 'navigable', 'are', 'very', 'well-designed', 'boot', 'opening', 'closing', 'themes', 'season', '1', 'matter-of-factly', 'series', 'whole', 'stand', 'television', 'greatest', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'pilot', 'well', 'also', 'music', 'stories', 'opening', 'closing', 'titles', 'are', 'television', 'greatest', 'closing', 'credits', 'even', 'included', 'longer', 'version', 'strobing', 'police', 'light', 'opening', 'season', '7', 'discs', 'are', 'superbly', 'packaged', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', '1996', 'documentary', 'w/Emme', 'Tomimbang', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'Finally', 'characters', 'McGarrett', 'Chin', 'Ho', 'weekly', 'guest', 'stars', 'settings', 'Iolani', 'Palace', 'entire', 'state', 'Hawaii', 'stories', 'straight-up', 'crime', 'dramas', ""late-'60"", 'combine', 'make', 'first', 'season', 'worth', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'must-buy', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'series', 'put', 'television', 'disc', 'collection', 'especially', ""'re"", 'just', 'starting', 'pass', 'Friends', 'Seinfeld', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'ignore', 'go', 'right', 'Five-O']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 1

If not for Hawaii Five-O, we would not have such hard driven detective shows that we have had. To praise the first season is easy. These mini movies were complete and complex stories, not like some of the items on TV today.The stories of the first season were good story telling. It also used one other character, its location..Hawaii. It was not a studio type of production, it was filmed in the 50th state fully. The cast did not dumb down the dialog nor the action and not the location. Note Hawaii may be the back drop, but it was not a sightseeing tour..meaning you saw Hawaii, but the audience was not made as a look at the sites. Hawaii's unique landscape is what made this interesting.Jack Lord was no Columbo. He was hard as nails team leader. He showed strenghth and conviction is every action and his team backed him.

1039023,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B000LE16VC,Brent Butler,"[4, 4]","Jack Lord was a well known actor before Hawaii Five-O, in fact he was offered the job of Captain Kirk, but the sides couldn't agree to terms when he demanded a piece of ownership in the show and the role of Co-Producer. While I think Jack would have made a fine Captain Kirk, we can all be thankful that he was free to play the role of Steve McGarret in this show, which had a long and distinguished run.I'm sure the ""re-imagined"" version of the show now in its second season (and a fine show in its own right) has probably rekindled interest in the original. Joining Jack Lord were James MacArthur (son of Helen Hayes) as ""Dano"", Zulu as Kono, and Kam Fong as Chin Ho (I always wondered why they bothered with different screen names for the last two actors LOL). McGarret was a tough investigator and a tough boss. In the first episode Danny Williams complains about a policewoman going undercover on a dangerous assignment. McGarret dismisses him abruptly by essentially saying ""Not your decision, now go do your job"". Dano wasn't happy. That kind of tension between the leads wouldn't be maintained, but viewers would have plenty of tension in the resolution of the crimes to replace it.The crimes were always interesting and different from other cop shows of the day. They were a bit like Columbo in that you normally knew ""who done it"" right at the start, and then watched as Five-O unearthed and apprehended the bad guys. Jack Lord played McGarret with just the right amount of hard edge, and the other roles meshed perfectly with his.The Amazon streaming video of this series is supposed to be in HD, but it doesn't look all that good. There is a lot of grain and film damage evident that was not remastered to improve, and for that reason I hold back one star from this presentation of the series. The sound is good however, and I'm sure it sounds better than in the original broadcasts.However, this series has not been in syndication for quite some time, so it is worth watching this version if you are a fan, and the picture is certainly no worse than the years old tape that been used for re-runs. I will say that the stories are captivating enough that the poor picture quality will quickly become lost to your senses.If you are an Amazon Prime Member, this series is free to stream to either your computer or any of the myriad internet enabled TVs, Blu ray players, or other boxes that do that trick.Enjoy.",4,An Iconic Show,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,2420,"['Jack', 'Lord', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'actor', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'fact', 'was', 'offered', 'job', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'sides', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'terms', 'when', 'demanded', 'piece', 'ownership', 'show', 'role', 'Co-Producer', 'think', 'Jack', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'fine', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'can', 'be', 'thankful', 'was', 'free', 'play', 'role', 'Steve', 'McGarret', 'show', 'had', 'long', 'distinguished', 'run.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 're-imagined', 'version', 'show', 'now', 'second', 'season', 'fine', 'show', 'own', 'right', 'probably', 'rekindled', 'interest', 'original', 'Joining', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'were', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'son', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'Dano', 'Zulu', 'Kono', 'Kam', 'Fong', 'Chin', 'Ho', 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'bothered', 'different', 'screen', 'names', 'last', 'two', 'actors', 'LOL', 'McGarret', 'was', 'tough', 'investigator', 'tough', 'boss', 'first', 'episode', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'policewoman', 'going', 'undercover', 'dangerous', 'assignment', 'McGarret', 'abruptly', 'essentially', 'saying', 'Not', 'decision', 'now', 'go', 'do', 'job', 'Dano', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'kind', 'tension', 'leads', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'maintained', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'plenty', 'tension', 'resolution', 'crimes', 'replace', 'it.The', 'crimes', 'were', 'always', 'interesting', 'different', 'other', 'cop', 'shows', 'day', 'were', 'bit', 'Columbo', 'normally', 'knew', 'who', 'done', 'right', 'start', 'then', 'watched', 'Five-O', 'unearthed', 'apprehended', 'bad', 'guys', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'played', 'McGarret', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'hard', 'edge', 'other', 'roles', 'meshed', 'perfectly', 'his.The', 'Amazon', 'streaming', 'video', 'series', 'supposed', 'be', 'HD', ""n't"", 'look', 'good', 'lot', 'grain', 'film', 'damage', 'evident', 'was', 'not', 'remastered', 'improve', 'reason', 'hold', 'back', 'one', 'star', 'presentation', 'series', 'sound', 'good', 'however', ""'m"", 'sure', 'better', 'original', 'broadcasts.However', 'series', 'not', 'been', 'syndication', 'quite', 'time', 'worth', 'watching', 'version', 'are', 'fan', 'picture', 'certainly', 'no', 'worse', 'years', 'old', 'tape', 'been', 'used', 're-runs', 'will', 'say', 'stories', 'are', 'captivating', 'poor', 'picture', 'quality', 'will', 'quickly', 'become', 'lost', 'senses.If', 'are', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Member', 'series', 'free', 'stream', 'computer', 'myriad', 'internet', 'enabled', 'TVs', 'Blu', 'ray', 'players', 'other', 'boxes', 'do', 'trick.Enjoy']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 1

But I had forgotten how GREAT this show was! And I mean right from the opening segment of the pilot, ""Cocoon,"" which features one of the most startling moments I've seen on TV, ever. And then the lead-in to that classic theme song. It was all there from the very first second. Jack Lord was perfectly McGarrett from the first moment, sort of like Joe Friday with a sense of humor. A SMALL sense of humor, but still. The only thing missing in the pilot was James MacArthur as Danno, but that was quickly rectified with the first proper show, aired a week after the pilot.This show is incredibly exciting, the dialogue is crackling and not hokey like I was afraid it would be after all this time, the police-procedural element is realistic, the scenery is wonderful and there's plenty of it for Jack Lord to chew on. The clothes and cars and type of villians (Commies, hippies, Japanese mafia, even Gavin MacLeod as a pimp) may have dated a bit, but for me that makes it all the more fun, it's a great window into American history, and you don't even need a textbook!

This missing scene is when McGarrett has been in the cocoon for 6 hours 30 minutes. He yells at Wo Fat through the air tubes, ""Soundproof cocoon, boloney! You've goofed Mr. Wo Fat! You hear me? You've goofed Fatso!"" Then Miller claims McGarrett is hallucinating. Wo Fat replies that McGarrett can indeed hear, and these sounds McGarrett hears are sounds few men have ever heard - the sounds are from being in the deprevation chamber for so long. ""We have something very special this time in our little goldfish bowl"" says Wo Fat at the end of this scene. However, it may be best this scene was left out. This particular sequence of ""Cocoon"" is supposed to show how cool McGarrett can be under pressure.

It looks to me that they just converted these without any picture quality improvements (no ""HQ"", ""HIGH RES"", etc.); which they don't claim anyway.  I wish I had known (esp. about the missing ep & editing - I've found several cut scenes - see comments) before I enthusiastically emptied my wallet.  I could have saved the $36/set for the inevitable less $$$ Boxed Set with all that's missing here.That's $36 x 12 Seasons, carry the one, = $432!!  ~1/2 a Grand for an INCOMPLETE, EDITED, NOT-SO-SHARPLY REMASTERED ""COLLECTION"".  For my money, if I like a series enough to own it and to pay for better quality than I can get from broadcasts, I want EVERY episode, unedited, and at least as clear as my own recordings.  You may consider waiting ~2 years (@ ~4 Seasons / year released) for the Boxed Set, which we've all seen in stores at Christmas for even much less popular series.  And Boxed Sets always have features to make them more attractive, such as ""high resolution digitally remastered"", ""previously unreleased episodes"", and ""un-edited original broadcasts"", the very things they haven't included in these, along with something like a Steve McGarrett replica badge or 1/25th scale Mercury.

Then they started producing DVDs of old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime .So far I&#8217;ve bought DVDs of forty shows. I&#8217;ve found some fine shows, such as Matlock and Trapper John, which I missed the first time around.One of the most pleasant surprises to me was the rediscovery of Hawaii Five-0 starring Jack Lord as state police Chief Steve McGarrett. If you watched the first five minutes of that show, you were hooked by immediate, intense drama. It was much more than just, &#8220;Book &#8216;em, Danno.&#8221; This was a truly excellent show, probably the best mystery-suspense thriller of all-time.It was an extraordinary cop show, even though some members of the cast were inexperienced actors recruited locally in the Honolulu area to give the show a more authentic sense of place.Jack Lord was terrific as the relentless McGarrett. The show even had a super villain in the Chinese Red commandant Wo Fat (Khigh Dhiegh). The friction between the clever Dhiegh and the relentless McGarrett remained unresolved at the close of the show&#8217;s twelve seasons.Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7.

1039048,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B000LE16VC,Flash,"[1, 1]","In the title of my review, what I'm trying to say is that the original Hawaii Five-0 was the type of television we (the United States) used to export to the rest of the world. And it were characters like Steve McGarrett that epitomized the American ideal in regard to ethical law enforcement and strict dealings with the criminal element. This realization was the big take-away I had after watching the first season of this classic show, that and the fact that I wanted to watch more. I guess what I'm saying is that we no longer export this kind of entertainment to the rest of the world and because of that, we suffer for it.This first season, originally broadcast in 1968, is interesting, quirky, and entertaining. Steve McGarrett, the head of Hawaii's Five 0 division, is of course the main focus with his no-nonsense approach to police detective work. He's willing to go to any length to catch the crooks. This includes some undercover work that sometimes borders on the ridiculous, yet succeeds because of McGarrett's boyishly honest sacrifice to put himself on the line. Check out the episode, ""Six Kilos"", where McGarrett teams up with the bad guys on a Mission Impossible-like heist to steal heroin for an unknown crime boss.The scenery is of course beautiful, the Hawaiian settings, whether on the beach or in the city and suburbs, are lush with blowing palm trees and Southern Pacific skies. Its so very interesting to view the world of the late 1960's, with the cars, the clothing and the hairstyles. In particular, I found the female of this time period to be very alluring, despite or in fact because of the fact that the dress styles were more modest and appealing, more womanly I would say. McGarrett is obviously attractive to the ladies, but he doesn't mix police work with pleasure, unless he's putting on the act.There are some strange moments in this season as well, such as Ricardo Montalbon playing a Japanese guy with very odd/fake looking eyes. They must have realized how silly it looked right? The depiction of the 1960's hippies was also quite amusing, such as in the episode ""Up Tight"", which includes some psychedelic drug scenes that are truly spaced out man. This counter culture topic was better handled in the episode ""Not That Much Different"" where a murder upsets the politics of a group of hippies running ""Peace"" magazine.Overall, I had a fun time watching this show. Jack Lord as McGarrett and the supporting cast, were all very good. The Hawaii flavor and the 1960's time period were so cool, just like McGarrett, not the ugly American at all, rather the type of man that used to be the America hero.",5,Steve McGarrett - Not the Ugly American at All,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,2640,"['title', 'review', 'what', ""'m"", 'trying', 'say', 'original', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'was', 'type', 'television', 'United', 'States', 'used', 'export', 'rest', 'world', 'were', 'characters', 'Steve', 'McGarrett', 'epitomized', 'American', 'ideal', 'regard', 'ethical', 'law', 'enforcement', 'strict', 'dealings', 'criminal', 'element', 'realization', 'was', 'big', 'take-away', 'had', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'classic', 'show', 'fact', 'wanted', 'watch', 'more', 'guess', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'longer', 'export', 'kind', 'entertainment', 'rest', 'world', 'suffer', 'it.This', 'first', 'season', 'originally', 'broadcast', '1968', 'interesting', 'quirky', 'entertaining', 'Steve', 'McGarrett', 'head', 'Hawaii', 'Five', '0', 'division', 'course', 'main', 'focus', 'no-nonsense', 'approach', 'police', 'detective', 'work', 'willing', 'go', 'length', 'catch', 'crooks', 'undercover', 'work', 'borders', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'McGarrett', 'boyishly', 'honest', 'sacrifice', 'put', 'line', 'Check', 'episode', 'Six', 'Kilos', 'where', 'McGarrett', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'Mission', 'Impossible-like', 'heist', 'steal', 'heroin', 'unknown', 'crime', 'boss.The', 'scenery', 'course', 'beautiful', 'Hawaiian', 'settings', 'beach', 'city', 'suburbs', 'are', 'lush', 'blowing', 'palm', 'trees', 'Southern', 'Pacific', 'skies', 'so', 'very', 'interesting', 'view', 'world', 'late', '1960', 'cars', 'clothing', 'hairstyles', 'particular', 'found', 'female', 'time', 'period', 'be', 'very', 'alluring', 'fact', 'fact', 'dress', 'styles', 'were', 'more', 'modest', 'appealing', 'more', 'womanly', 'would', 'say', 'McGarrett', 'obviously', 'attractive', 'ladies', ""n't"", 'mix', 'police', 'work', 'pleasure', 'putting', 'act.There', 'are', 'strange', 'moments', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'Ricardo', 'Montalbon', 'playing', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'very', 'odd/fake', 'looking', 'eyes', 'must', 'have', 'realized', 'how', 'silly', 'looked', 'right', 'depiction', '1960', 'hippies', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'amusing', 'such', 'episode', 'Tight', 'psychedelic', 'drug', 'scenes', 'are', 'truly', 'spaced', 'out', 'man', 'counter', 'culture', 'topic', 'was', 'better', 'handled', 'episode', 'Not', 'Much', 'Different', 'where', 'murder', 'politics', 'group', 'hippies', 'running', 'Peace', 'magazine.Overall', 'had', 'fun', 'time', 'watching', 'show', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'McGarrett', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'Hawaii', 'flavor', '1960', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'so', 'cool', 'just', 'McGarrett', 'not', 'ugly', 'American', 'rather', 'type', 'man', 'used', 'be', 'America', 'hero']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 1

Aside from the obvious fact that the title of this series ends with the letter O and the reboot uses the number 0, this one emphasizes story and dialogue over anything else. The reboot emphasizes action, drama, suspense and even some romance. To each his own, but I personally like both series' and can't wait for the second season of Hawaii Five-0. I'm also interested in the second season of Hawaii Five-O. The guest stars are very good in their roles, and of course, McGarrett utters his famous catchphrase ""Book 'em, Danno,"" which a security guard in the middle school I went to always said to me whenever he saw me, though I never understood why until I got interested in this series and the reboot.My recommendation is, buy BOTH series'. You won't regret it. Both have the same theme music and the famous catchphrase.",5,"Bought To CompareTo Reboot.

1039053,A1A535W556ROBQ,B000LE16VC,James Ferguson,"[76, 85]","With one of the most recognizable theme songs in television history, Hawaii Five-O literally burst onto the television screen with its rapid fire montage of opening credits and a brisk pace to its action that was unusual at the time.  It served as a counter punch to the lazy images of Hawaiians basking in the sun, by revealing a complex world of crime that swirled around Honolulu like a cyclone.  It was up to Steve McGarrett and his boys to rid the island of these unwanted elements, with Wo Fat being his most memorable nemesis.  The show may not have been the first to showcase local talent, but it had a strong cast made up of Americans and Asians that presaged the multi-ethnic crime dramas of the late 70s and 80s.  It goes without saying that it was the inspiration for Miami Vice, but this was no pastel color version of Honolulu.  You can forget Don Ho singing Tiny Bubbles.  McGarret looked more like a hardnosed FBI agent than he did the chief detective, running his crew like drill sergeant.  James MacArthur may have seemed a little soft but he provided the necessary relief to Lord's hardboiled command.  Kam Fong played the memorable Chin Ho through most of the series, which lasted 12 years.

1039056,A1IDHSZ4VKLP80,B000LE16VC,"J. Beaulieu ""gwerllyd""","[5, 5]","Why it took so very long for Hawaii Five-0 to come out on DVD still mystifies me.  The show was a classic while it was still running, and it's remained a classic ever since.One thing I want to clear up -- the show's title is Hawaii Five-0 -- that ""0"" is correctly a ZERO, not a letter.  The show was named after the USA's 50th state.Many people -- Amazon.com included -- incorrectly assume the title is Hawaii Five-O [""O"" being the letter, not a zero], which makes searching for other seasons of the show difficult, because the only way what you're going to find what you want is to search using the ""O"" letter -- which annoys Five-0 buffs big time.  I hope Amazon takes note.One other item:  during the entire 12 years that Five-0 ran on television, there was only ONE star:  Jack Lord.  All the other members of Five-0 were billed as ""feature"" players.  No matter who showed up as a guest actor or actress, NOBODY was ever billed as ""starring with"" -- Five-0 meant Jack Lord.  HE was the star.  The ONLY star.The best thing about the DVDs -- and I've got all of them that are currently available -- is that they take us back to the actual time when the series was being filmed.  If a specific ""issue"" is treated in one particular episode, that issue was very specific when it comes to the history of the late 1960s and all of the 1970s.  Many episodes were considered daring at the time they aired -- Five-0 tackles Vietnam, organized crime, the Soviet threat [and of course, that of Red China], and struggle for the Hawaiian people who were -- and still are -- trying to maintain their Polynesian identity, and the show sometimes got downright daring AT THE TIME THE EPISODE FIRST RAN ON TV.Five-0 tackled such stuff as venereal disease, political corruption, drug use which was so very prevalent at that time, and aired one two-part episode focusing on the US military and its secrecy about trying to create our own weapons of mass destruction.  Jack Lord was the first person in television history who ever uttered the word ""bastard"" on television.Most folks who are new to the series do not understand what it was like to live in the late 60s and 70s, and not many know that much about the history of the period.  What seems ""tame"" to us now created all kinds of furor when viewed on television during those years.  Five-0 was forced to reinvent itself in the later years of its run, because of the nationwide furor about violence on television -- and if you've seen the show in recent years -- shows that have been badly chopped up, often to the point where the shows don't make a great deal of sense -- the DVDs will give you every single moment of what ran on television when commercial time was FAR less that what we put up with today.  WhenFive-0 was forced to tone down the violence [and there's lots of violence in the first 6 or 7 years] and to keep the show running and maintain viewer interest, it turned to character study as a way of filling that gap.  Specifically, it became more cerebral -- but it worked.So when you watch the first set of DVDs [and the later DVDs as well], keep in mind what life was like when leisure suits were ""HOT"" [they now look quite ghastly to me], disco music was sweeping the country [thanks to John Travolta] -- yep, McGarrett ends up in a disco himself, more than once -- and all kinds of other social matters were highly important, probably more important than they are today.To watch Hawaii Five-0 [remember that zero!] is to remember history.

Herman,"[17, 18]","One of the greatest and longest-running shows of all time, Hawaii Five-0 has been long-ignored by TV-DVD makers for years, forcing fans to wear out their videotape copies of the grainy, washed-out, cut-for-syndication episodes that have aired continuously around the world since the show left network TV in 1980.  Fortunately, the folks at CBS-Paramount decided the time had come to make this show available to DVD fans, and they have knocked this one out of the park!The episodes in this set look fantastic in all their digitally-remastered and uncut glory. These shows have never appeared so clear and vibrant, with nary a speck of dirt or grit appearing on the prints. The only episode that appears to not have gotten the remastering treatment is ""Six Kilos"", which still looks better than it ever has in syndication (where it was curiously hard to find in rotation).  The episodes, with a great range of guest stars including Leslie Nielsen, Gavin MacLeod (as a vicious drug dealer), Yaphet Kotto and Ricardo Montalban, appear every bit as modern and relevant as any current network television show airing today, despite the fact that it is almost 40 years old. The packaging and menus also get high marks, some of the best I've ever seen among older shows on DVD. This set was clearly put together by a group of people at Paramount who have genuine love for the show.In the meantime, I just finished viewing the Emme's Island Memories documentary on disc 7, and it was wonderful that they were able to get so many of the cast and crew on camera recounting their memories of the show. It's especially touching knowing that so many of them have passed away since, and that their thoughts on the show will be preserved for all to enjoy for many years to come. I defy any true fan of the show not to get a lump in their throat when they get to the Jack Lord tribute in the show.This is a set that deserves a place in anyone's home who is a fan of great TV cop shows, or just quality programs in general.

It doesn't rely on special effects or car chases to draw an audience.  It amazes me when I remember hearing at the time Hawaii 5-O was on the air how it was the most violent show on T.V.Jack Lord played the Head of 5-O, Steve McGarrett, beautifully.  He made the role believable and likable.  You couldn't wait to see how he led his team to solve crimes every week.  It took work, logic and a team effort to catch the criminals.  No computers or scientific wizardry.  It is a gritty crime drama that entertains.  I looked forward to hearing McGarrett say at the end of each episode, ""Book 'em Dano"".

The picture quality is good though some shots are grainy and even out of focus. I imagine some of these are just foul-ups we have to live with due to the fact there were a lot of inexperienced people behind the scenes. In an ironic touch, with the improved sound, the background music that kicks in at crucial moments is sometimes annoying and just plain corny(in the episode ""And they painted daisies....,"" where Dano is accused of murdering an 18 year old kid, the strings that kick each time things get bad for him are almost laughable). Yet when that wave starts rolling and the theme music kicks in, it is still as dramatic as ever.Okay, so the stories are dated and over the top but what still comes through is the man himself - McGarrett. In going thru these episodes it really hits home that Jack Lord was this show. His presence on the small screen is right up there with the presence a DeNiro or Nicholson bring to the big screen. I once had a police office as a neighbor and he used to laugh at the show because in every episode McGarrett would either violate the constitution  or end up with such flimsy of evidence that, in real life, no arrest of his would ever hold up in court!  Ah but who cares, it is still fun even after all these years.The one main ""extra"" is the inclusion of a 1996 television special paying homage to the show, co-hosted by James MacArthur. Of course, many of the cast members are no longer with us but it is still a fun history lesson to view.  Sadly, Jack Lord was too ill with Alzheimer's disease to take part but his presence is felt vividly in the way the cast recalls him. I mean the guy sounded like an egotistical jerk but at the same time, the show succeeded because of him.As of this review, the price of the DVD set is $33.99 and I can say I am not sure what else can provide me with so much enjoyment and fond memories for the same money.",5,"Alright, it is dated, sappy, and silly BUT still a lot of fun!",1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2005,"['was', 'very', 'pleased', 'treatment', 'show', 'finally', 'been', 'given', 'DVD', 'recommend', 'highly', 'fans', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'shots', 'are', 'grainy', 'even', 'focus', 'imagine', 'are', 'just', 'foul-ups', 'have', 'live', 'due', 'fact', 'were', 'lot', 'inexperienced', 'people', 'scenes', 'ironic', 'touch', 'improved', 'sound', 'background', 'music', 'crucial', 'moments', 'sometimes', 'annoying', 'just', 'plain', 'corny', 'episode', 'painted', 'daisies', 'where', 'Dano', 'accused', 'murdering', '18', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'strings', 'kick', 'time', 'things', 'get', 'bad', 'are', 'almost', 'laughable', 'when', 'wave', 'rolling', 'theme', 'music', 'kicks', 'still', 'as', 'dramatic', 'ever.Okay', 'stories', 'are', 'dated', 'top', 'what', 'still', 'man', 'McGarrett', 'going', 'episodes', 'really', 'home', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'was', 'show', 'presence', 'small', 'screen', 'right', 'there', 'presence', 'DeNiro', 'Nicholson', 'bring', 'big', 'screen', 'once', 'had', 'police', 'office', 'neighbor', 'used', 'laugh', 'show', 'episode', 'McGarrett', 'would', 'either', 'violate', 'constitution', 'end', 'up', 'such', 'flimsy', 'evidence', 'real', 'life', 'arrest', 'would', 'ever', 'hold', 'up', 'court', 'Ah', 'who', 'still', 'fun', 'even', 'years.The', 'one', 'main', 'extra', 'inclusion', '1996', 'television', 'special', 'paying', 'homage', 'show', 'co-hosted', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'course', 'many', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'still', 'fun', 'history', 'lesson', 'view', 'Sadly', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'was', 'too', 'ill', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'take', 'part', 'presence', 'felt', 'vividly', 'way', 'cast', 'mean', 'guy', 'sounded', 'egotistical', 'jerk', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'succeeded', 'him.As', 'review', 'price', 'DVD', 'set', '33.99', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'provide', 'so', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'fond', 'memories', 'same', 'money']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 1

I've come accustomed to this show through re-runs that have been shown on UK television.Hawaii five o was and is essential tv viewing, from the beautiful locations to the cracking storylines.The one and only gripe I have about the show is that although it is one of the longest running detective tv shows in history, it was possibly too long, most fans will agree that from perhaps the last few seasons the show had run out of steam, plots were thin and Jack Lord was getting too old. However that doesn't matter overall as collectivley, this was a great show! So please don't let that put you off as 85% of the series was fantastic!There have been a lot of the 'older' tv shows released on dvd by studios but they  have not got the kind of respect they deserve (e.g re-remastering and special features), but I must say, hats off to paramount, they have released a fantastic set, each episode has been remastered and looks great for a show nearly 40 years old. And have even included a special feature on disc 7, so (and I don't say this very often, as most studios are clueless when its comes to releasing a dvd set that both the fans and show deserve!) paramount have exceeded themselves, so thanks and keep this up when producing further seasons. Which reminds me, from what I can gather the dvd set itself is sold out hawaii, and many internet sites are sold out and have them on backorder.

Like The Streets of San Francisco and Miami Vice, Hawaii Five-O made the most of its beautiful locations, especially when it came to its opening credits. From the scenes of Diamondhead and Honolulu to the views of beautiful island girls to the dramatic zoom to a closeup of Jack Lord standing atop the Ilikai Hotel, the credits sequence always got the show off to a rousing start a la the gunbarrel openings in the James Bond films.

One thing that made this series so good (as I now see) was that, apart from being set in 'Paradise', as its worthy successor Magnum P.I. would be, there was no set formula for the stories; the variety is constantly surprising. The two-part story of how McGarrett deals with a person claiming to cure cancer by an electronic gadget is one I remember from childhood.The series (and DVD) have been so well made that it's easy to forget that what we see on screen was filmed over three decades ago.

1039082,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B000LE16VC,mk,"[4, 4]","This is a super show that lasted 12 seasons, 11 with James MacArthur(Danno), and that was not just a great hit drama series, but was also filmed on location- a rarity in those days.This is a nice collection.  Even though, I grew up watching these as a kid- making sure to get to the tv before it started, so I could see that fantastic intro- so far, I can't remember if stuff is left out from the original series.  Some of the other reviewers mention previews or a scene or two missing, I can't tell.  But I do enjoy them.The late 60's had issues- Vietnam war, protest, antiestablisment, assassinations, student discontent, 'sex, drugs and rock and roll, baby', hippie generation, odd colors and clothes, big cruisers for cars.  One can sense it in the filming of this series and how the various stories are presented.  We definitely needed solid heroes, and the likes of McGarrett and Matt Dillon and others helped.This is not family fare.  The tales are pretty violent; although; they don't show too much and there's no language or sex seen.  One might see blood stains on the shirt.  Most things are implied with a cutaway.They use a lot of locals in the production; however, I always found it odd that they prefer TV regulars like John Morley playing an Hawaian or Ricardo Montalban starring as a Japenese gangster- OK.  That's just what they did in those days, I guess.  And these guys would rotate through all the TV shows making guest appearances.  Unless they got their own series.My favorite episodes involve Wo Fat- McGarrett's sinister, international, antagonist.  It's a bit of James Bondish type stuff and it runs off and on through the series starting with the pilot.  Otherwise, it's murder and mayhem in paradise as usual.Compared to 21st century shows, the color, filming, music(except for the theme), stories and acting are dated to some extent. I'm fine with that and enjoy the shows and mysteries for what they are.  Hawai'i still looks the same to me, and it's a great place to escape to even to just watch Jack Lord put the bad guys away.",5,An Aloha Blast to the Past!,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,2060,"['super', 'show', 'lasted', '12', 'seasons', '11', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'Danno', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'hit', 'drama', 'series', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'location-', 'rarity', 'days.This', 'nice', 'collection', 'Even', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'kid-', 'making', 'sure', 'get', 'tv', 'started', 'could', 'see', 'fantastic', 'intro-', 'so', 'far', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'stuff', 'left', 'out', 'original', 'series', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mention', 'previews', 'scene', 'two', 'missing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'do', 'enjoy', 'them.The', 'late', '60', 'had', 'issues-', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'protest', 'antiestablisment', 'assassinations', 'student', 'discontent', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'baby', 'hippie', 'generation', 'odd', 'colors', 'clothes', 'big', 'cruisers', 'cars', 'One', 'can', 'sense', 'filming', 'series', 'how', 'various', 'stories', 'are', 'presented', 'definitely', 'needed', 'solid', 'heroes', 'likes', 'McGarrett', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'others', 'helped.This', 'not', 'family', 'fare', 'tales', 'are', 'pretty', 'violent', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'too', 'much', 'language', 'sex', 'seen', 'One', 'might', 'see', 'blood', 'stains', 'shirt', 'Most', 'things', 'are', 'implied', 'cutaway.They', 'use', 'lot', 'locals', 'production', 'however', 'always', 'found', 'odd', 'prefer', 'TV', 'regulars', 'John', 'Morley', 'playing', 'Hawaian', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'starring', 'Japenese', 'gangster-', 'OK.', 'That', 'just', 'what', 'did', 'days', 'guess', 'guys', 'would', 'rotate', 'TV', 'making', 'guest', 'appearances', 'got', 'own', 'series.My', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'involve', 'Wo', 'Fat-', 'McGarrett', 'sinister', 'international', 'antagonist', 'bit', 'James', 'Bondish', 'type', 'stuff', 'off', 'series', 'starting', 'pilot', 'Otherwise', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'paradise', 'as', 'usual.Compared', '21st', 'century', 'shows', 'color', 'filming', 'music', 'theme', 'stories', 'acting', 'are', 'dated', 'extent', ""'m"", 'fine', 'enjoy', 'shows', 'mysteries', 'what', 'are', 'Hawai', 'i', 'still', 'same', 'great', 'place', 'escape', 'even', 'just', 'watch', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'put', 'bad', 'guys', 'away']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 1

While I was a kid throughout the seventies, I recall Hawaii Five-0 as a constant staple in television entertainment.  As I grew older, I always looked forward to Five-0 reruns and came to really enjoy the character of Steve McGarrett.  To this day, McGarrett remains my favorite TV cop (my favorite movie cop being Steve McQueen as Bullitt).Whether it was the scriptwriters or Jack Lord, the portrayal McGarrett's character, while gruff and authoritative, demonstrated a fair treatment of the people he encountered.  McGarrett saw good in people and, despite his overt conventionality, seemed to have a soft spot and sympathy for a variety of citizens, such as counter culture hippies who seemed truly dedicated to their principals; quite a statement to those who view McGarrett as wooden and above the law.  If anything, he was devoted to the protection of all people.Anyhow, I am glad to have Hawaii Five-0 back at ready to watch anytime I want it.

1039084,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B000LE16VC,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[2, 3]","Hawaii Five-O is an American television series that starred Jack Lord and James MacArthur as detectives for a fictional Hawaii state police department. The show ran for 12 seasons, from 1968 to 1980, making it the longest running crime show on American television until the police drama Law & Order surpassed it in 2003. The twelfth season was repackaged into syndication under the title McGarrett.The CBS television network produced the program from September 20, 1968 to April 5, 1980. Currently, the program is broadcast in syndication throughout the world and on-demand streaming media via CBS Interactive.[1] Created by Leonard Freeman, Hawaii Five-O was shot on location in Honolulu, Hawaii, and throughout the island of Oahu -- with occasional filming in other locales like Los Angeles, Singapore and Hong Kong as well as other Hawaiian islands.Hawaii Five-O centers on a fictional state police force (named in honor of Hawaii's status as the 50th State)[2] led by former Navy officer Steve McGarrett (Jack Lord), who was appointed by the Governor Paul Jameson (Richard Denning). McGarrett was assisted regularly by State Police officers -- a young officer, Danny Williams (played with intensity by Tim O'Kelley in the show's pilot, but replaced in the regular series by James MacArthur), Chin Ho Kelly (Kam Fong) and Kono Kalakaua (Zulu). Later, Honolulu Police Department Officer Duke Lukela (Herman Wedemeyer) joined the team as a regular, as did Ben Kokua (Al Harrington) who replaced Kono. Occasionally, they were assisted by other officers on an ""as-needed"" basis. During the course of the show, the team was also assisted regularly by: medical examiner Doc Bergman (Al Eben), forensic specialist Che Fong (Harry Endo) and a secretary. The first secretary was May (Maggi Parker), then Jenny (Peggy Ryan) and later Luana (Laura Sode-Matteson).For twelve seasons, McGarrett and his team hounded international secret agents, criminals, and Mafia syndicates plaguing the Hawaiian Islands. With the aid of District Attorney and later Hawaii's Attorney General John Manicote (Glenn Cannon), McGarrett was successful in sending most of his enemies to prison. One such Mafia syndicate was led by crime family patriarch Honore Vashon (Harold Gould), a character introduced in the fifth season. Blaming McGarrett for the death of his son, Vashon swore vengeance using all of the resources available to him. Most episodes of Hawaii Five-O ended with the arrest of criminals with McGarrett's catch phrase to Williams, ""Book 'em, Danno!"", with the offense occasionally added after this phrase, such as ""-Murder one!"". Other criminals and organized crime bosses on the islands were played by actors such as Ricardo Montalban, Gavin MacLeod, and Ross Martin as Tony Alika. For the 12th and final season, series regular James MacArthur had left the show (in 1996, he admitted he had got tired and wanted to do other things), as did Kam Fong after season 10. New characters Jim 'Kimo' Carew (William Smith), Lori Wilson (Sharon Farrell), and Truck (Moe Keale) were introduced in season 12 alongside returning regular Duke Lukela.The Five-O team consisted of four to five members (small for a real state police unit) and was portrayed as occupying a suite of offices in the Iolani Palace. (The office interiors were a soundstage set.) Curiously, it lacked its own radio network, necessitating frequent requests by McGarrett to the Honolulu Police Department dispatchers to ""Patch me through to Danno"". McGarrett's tousled yet immovable hairstyle and proclivity for wearing a dark suit and tie on all possible occasions rapidly entered popular culture.In many episodes (including the pilot), McGarrett was drawn into the world of international espionage and national intelligence. McGarrett's archnemesis was an intelligence officer of the People's Republic of China, Wo Fat. The Communist rogue agent was played by veteran actor Khigh Dheigh.The show's action and straightforward story-telling left little time for personal stories such as wives and girlfriends, though a two-part story in the first season dealt with the loss of McGarrett's sister's baby. Occasionally, a show would flash back to McGarrett's younger years or to a romantic figure. The viewer is left with the impression that McGarrett, like Dragnet's Joe Friday, is wedded to the police force and to crime-fighting at this point in his life.Hawaii Five-O survived long enough to see reruns of early episodes enter syndication while new episodes were still being produced. The 12th season was repackaged into syndication under the title McGarrett.The show was the longest running crime show on American TV until the police drama Law & Order surpassed it in 2003. The popularity of the Hawaii Five-O format spawned various police dramas on all the major television networks since its debut. Another legacy is the popularity of the Hawaii Five-O theme song, composed by Morton Stevens and later covered by surf music band The Ventures and by Radio Birdman, a punk-era band from Sydney. A short cover can be seen at the end of the Massacre Palestina's song, ""Madamme X"". The song is particularly popular with college and high school marching bands, especially at the University of Hawai'i, where it has become the unofficial fight song. It also made a brief appearance in the animated film Shrek 2, when a trumpeter enthusiastically follows a fanfare with the first few bars of the theme song, and in the Australian film The Dish, about the Apollo XI moon landing, when a teenage Australian band mistakenly played it thinking it was the American national anthem.While the location, theme song, and esemble cast made ""Hawaii Five-O"" one of the longest running police dramas in television history, the show is also noted for it's liberal use of exterior locations as ""sets"" throughout the entire 12 seasons, breaking the tradition of filming indoors as with the case for a typical TV series. A typical episode, on average, would have at least two-thirds of all footage shot outdoors.The term ""Five-O"" was adopted by American youth culture as a street slang term for the police.The television show Magnum P.I. was created after Hawaii Five-O ended its run in order to make further use of the production equipment left there. The first few episodes made direct references to Five-O, suggesting that it takes place in the same ""universe"" as the earlier show.Criticism of the show pointed out that the vast majority of characters were Caucasian, while only 40% of the population of the state identify themselves as non-Hispanic Caucasian. However, many local people were used to play parts in the show. The first run and syndication was seen by an estimated 400,000,000 people around the world.Jack Lord was the only actor to appear in all episodes of Five-O and was the only original cast member remaining when its last episode aired in May 1980. He and Herman Wedemeyer were the only actors to appear in the first episode (excluding the pilot) and the last episode of the series.MacArthur has said on talk show appearances that he calculates the Five-O team would have accounted for all major crime and criminals on the islands several times over.The show continues to be seen in Hawaii since it left the air, thus making it the longest-running show to continue airing in the state after it ceased production. It is currently seen on Honolulu independent outlet KWHE.At least 3 episodes were centered around Danno. One episode took us to his apartment, and a second one probed into his love life a bit. He was engaged to a woman whose death was the plot line of the episode. A third episode in 1976 has Danny dating an actress, Anne Waring (Meg Foster), who becomes a target of criminals.In a 1st season episode, a two-parter ""Once Upon A Time"", we learn that McGarrett has a sister and a brother-in-law. The story line has McGarrett going to California to visit his sister and brother-in-law after learning that their infant son has cancer. A doctor is treating the baby with unethical methods to cure him, but the baby dies anyway. McGarrett seeks out the truth about the doctor and her unethical methods on patients.Chin Ho Kelly had 8 kids, as we learned in a second season Five-O episode, Cry Lie. This seems to have been a family trait, as his many relatives were apparently involved in all facets of life in Hawaii, from laborers in the sugar cane fields to Honolulu policemen, bartenders, tour bus drivers, etc. -- and Kelly knew them all by name. This is actually authentic, as descendants of the early Chinese cane field laborers diversified throughout Hawaiian society, while maintaining family ties.In the TV-movie pilot, McGarrett drove a Mercury 2-door hardtop, apparently a 1967 Marquis (1967 was the first year for the Marquis, and it was only available as a 2-door hardtop). This car had a black body, black vinyl roof, and a red interior. In the series, McGarrett's trademark vehicle, often seen squealing tires throughout Honolulu, was a triple-black 1968 Mercury Park Lane Brougham 4-door hardtop. In a recurring continuity error, footage of the 2-door hardtop appeared in many episodes of the series. Around the 1973/74 season, his Park Lane was replaced by a 1973 Mercury Marquis Brougham 4-door, used until the end of the series. In a new recurring continuity error, footage of the 1968 Mercury appears in many episodes after the Mercury Marquis Brougham replaced it. After the show, Jack Lord gave the 1974 Mercury car he drove on the show to his stunt man, Jack Nordlum.The phone numbers that were dialed from various Honolulu-area phone booths throughout the run of the series were actual household numbers, which caused some ""invasion of privacy"" concerns for residents, even after the series ended; hence in the middle of the series run, the Honolulu phone prefix ""(808) 555-xxxx"" was to be used on every episode from then on.James MacArthur was the son of stage and film legend Helen Hayes; Hayes guest starred on a 1975 episode of Hawaii Five-0, ""Retire to Sunny Hawaii"", playing Danny Williams' aunt.[8]After their short-lived NBC series The Quest in 1976, Kurt Russell and Tim Matheson appeared together in the 1977 ""Deadly Doubles"" episode of Hawaii Five-O.[Jack Lord was the only actor to appear in all episodes of Five-O and was the only original cast member remaining when its last episode aired in May 1980.

Technically well prepared, with generally high quality video and audio.  Only one episode (Twenty-Four Karat Kill)  showed some audio degradation.  I run my audio through my stereo and you can crank up the theme song loud enough to wake the neighbors and it still sounds crisp and clean (except that one episode which is kind of ""muddy"" sounding overall).  Episodes run a full 51 minutes each, not the 42 of todays shows!The special feature EMME'S ISLAND MOMENTS--Memories of Hawaii Five-O has lots of interviews with cast members and others who worked on Hawaii Five-O.  It runs 42 minutes (appx) and you'll learn lots about the making of the show!Well packaged in four ""slim-line"" plastic cases in a slip case box, which keep the discs well protected.  Not chintzy like some other multi-disc sets.FUN things to look for during the episodes???  McGarrett's ""magical morphing Mercury"" that sometimes sprouts (or loses) a couple of doors enroute to crime scenes!  Watch for Herman Wedemeyer and Al Harrington (who in later seasons become regular members of the Five-O team) appearing as a criminal or different police officer!  See several different Che Fong's in the lab (Harry Endo doesn't appear as Che yet!).  Watch for Richard Denning (the Governer) doing double duty as a U.S. Treasury agent with a different name!  Plus check out the cool Pontiac ambulances from back when ambulances had STYLE, but not that much medical care!Only thing missing (pay attention producers!) was those great ""THIS IS JACK LORD....BE THERE, ALOHA!"" previews for the next weeks episode.  I'm guessing they're ""lost to the ravages of time"", but if they still exist I'd be willing to bet we'd ALL want them included in the later seasons sets!All in all, FIVE STARS FOR FIVE-O!

Even when I contacted the TV stations airing the show, they didn't know when if at all Paramount would release it.  I then wrote a letter directly to them.  No reply, but I'd like to think it helped. Yes Law & Order and Gunsmoke have lasted longer than Hawaii Five-O, but this show has a lot to be proud of.  It is late 60's early '70s TV but it doesn't get old.  The topics and drama then are applicable now, it's presently however that we tolerate frank violence on TV. Five-O did it with ""class and style"" in part due to act-based segments and scored music. Much of it is a stretch from reality but the plots involving crime are mostly true and unfortunate human conditions of greed, revenge, drug use., etc. All you young folks out there give this one a try.One last thing.

1039090,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000LE16VC,"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man""","[8, 11]","First off, ""Hawaii 5-0"" was like nothing that had preceded it!Although the show was filmed in glorious color, showing Hawaiian locales at their most appealing, the story lines were truly shaded in black and white.  Unlike today's fare, one could distinguish between the good guys and the bad ones.Chief among the former is Steve McGarrett, played with a hard-hitting, take-no-prisoners swagger by the great Jack Lord.  The fact that Lord never won an Emmy for his fine performance is another one of the industry's injustices.In the first season, we learn that McGarrett is a former Naval officer, leading an elite team of investigators in the fictional police unit known as ""Hawaii 5-0.""  So influential was the show during its twelve-year run, many a visitor to the state actually thought that such an enforcement agency existed.This is a testament to the brilliant cast (including James McArthur, Kam Fong, Zulu, and Richard Denning as ""The Governor""), expert writing, exciting guest stars, eye-catching camerawork, exotic locations, and the best durn theme song ever created for television.The first season of the show didn't just delve into typical cop fare.  Stories dealt with quack doctors, the controversial Viet Nam war, the social revolution and the hippie movement, along with international espionage.As far as the latter is concerned, the pilot episode (included on this compilation) introduces McGarrett's chief nemesis, the sinister Chinese agent ""Wo Fat,"" memorably played by Khigh Dhiegh.  The actor would appear frequently throughout the show's tenure.Guest stars included such familiar faces as singer Tommy Sands, Andrew Duggan, Sally Kellerman, Sal Mineo, Harold J. Stone,  Leslie Nielsen, Farley Granger, Jeanette Nolan, Gavin MacLeod, Nancy Malone, Nancy Kovack, and Kevin McCarthy.  Emmy-worthy turns are also delivered by Yaphet Kotto as a tortured war veteran (""King of the Hill""), Ron Feinberg as a mentally-challenged murderer (""Pray Love Remember, Pray Love Remember"") and Joanne Linville as a fraudulent doctor in the two-parter ""Once Upon a Time.""As was common during the era, Caucasian actors were allowed to play ""ethnic"" roles, thus one can forgive the casting of the aforementioned Feinberg, Simon Oakland, David Opatoshu, and John Marley, respectively, as native Hawaiians.

1039093,A1GG3J0SNY1BQR,B000LE16VC,Rick,"[44, 52]","The 1st Season is set to be released just about spring cleaning time. What a great break from putting back the screens and sorting the attic. But this DVD version promises to be more than a diversion, as was the original TV series. For those of you who are too young to have watched it, Hawaii Five-0 remains the longest running cop show (1968-80)--and for good reason. It combined crisp script-writing that followed ""The Formula"" with some of the first on-locale shooting, superb production elements from Leonard Freeman and his seasoned crew, and the consistent professionalism of its star, Jack Lord. As noted elsewhere here, the opening sequence (a montage of Polynesian enticement intermingled with modern Honolulu, to the tune of The Ventura's big instrumental hit) itself is a stirring sequence and indeed won an Emmy for its editing.To be sure, the acting is at times wooden, stiff to the point of making caricatures of the actors, but as the series developed, so too did the characters, endearing themselves to loyal viewers. Much has been made of the scenery, or rather the local setting, and how it enhanced the plot line. (The DVD format will no doubt bring a richer texture and sharper definition to the setting which the VHS format could never do). And it is worth noting that Freeman insisted on filming this on-location in Hawaii, an initially costly calculation that introduced the Aloha State to countless millions of viewers, and literally loaded the state coffers with tourist dollars.Still uncertain as to whether to buy? Then consider the fact that Hawaii Five-0 has been in syndication for decades and shows no signs of waning interest. The number of fan websites devoted to the series is testament enough. In Germany and elsewhere, it has an almost cult following rivaling the Bond films and in Paradise itself it is almost a rite of passage for many locals. Sure, much has been made of how the locals were used in this TV series but considering when it ran it was far ahead of its time. The series also gave a start to many local acting careers and its cast frequently sponsored or otherwise underwrote many local dramatic productions. A genuine man of principles like the character he portrayed--he was quietly active in local philanthropy--Jack Lord himself loved the islands and its people, which actually reveals itself with poignancy in some of scenes.The show was not afraid to confront issues of the day head-on. Of course many of those concerns might seem trite from today's vantage point but others remain pressing: a soldier returning from war (in this case Vietnam), another soldier unable to shake the bitterness of another war (with Japan), environmental protectionism, the usurpation of Hawaiian culture and the destructive power of youth drug culture, and crime in general.I look forward to reliving a portion of my adolescence when viewing this DVD. It will also be refreshing to hear dialogue that in unabashedly candid if at times a little corny and stilted, and written without the need to circumvent the censor. For despite being a cop show, it is unrated and therefore appropriate for older children to watch. It has little in the way of gratuitious or graphic violence and the language isn't a torrent of expletives. Sure, there was never a special state police force, but it bears mentioning that HPD headquarters actually includes a small museum as a lasting tribute to the show.Now, if you happen to know the show well, you don't need my exhortations. And you won't think me odd to admit that on occasion when I stroll past Iolani Palace or the Ilikai Hotel, I make an upward glance, to see if McGarrett is looking through the blinds or leaning over the balcony rail with that trademark grin of his.",5,Book This on Your Spring-Cleaning List,1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,3749,"['1st', 'Season', 'set', 'be', 'released', 'just', 'spring', 'cleaning', 'time', 'What', 'great', 'break', 'putting', 'back', 'screens', 'sorting', 'attic', 'DVD', 'version', 'promises', 'be', 'more', 'diversion', 'was', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'watched', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'longest', 'running', 'cop', 'show', '1968-80', 'good', 'reason', 'combined', 'crisp', 'script-writing', 'followed', 'Formula', 'first', 'on-locale', 'shooting', 'superb', 'production', 'elements', 'Leonard', 'Freeman', 'seasoned', 'crew', 'consistent', 'professionalism', 'star', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'noted', 'elsewhere', 'here', 'opening', 'sequence', 'montage', 'Polynesian', 'enticement', 'intermingled', 'modern', 'Honolulu', 'tune', 'Ventura', 'big', 'instrumental', 'hit', 'stirring', 'sequence', 'indeed', 'won', 'Emmy', 'editing.To', 'be', 'sure', 'acting', 'times', 'wooden', 'stiff', 'point', 'making', 'caricatures', 'actors', 'series', 'developed', 'so', 'too', 'did', 'characters', 'endearing', 'loyal', 'viewers', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'scenery', 'rather', 'local', 'setting', 'how', 'enhanced', 'plot', 'line', 'DVD', 'format', 'will', 'doubt', 'bring', 'richer', 'texture', 'sharper', 'definition', 'setting', 'VHS', 'format', 'could', 'never', 'do', 'worth', 'noting', 'Freeman', 'insisted', 'filming', 'on-location', 'Hawaii', 'initially', 'costly', 'calculation', 'introduced', 'Aloha', 'State', 'countless', 'millions', 'viewers', 'literally', 'loaded', 'state', 'coffers', 'tourist', 'dollars.Still', 'uncertain', 'buy', 'Then', 'consider', 'fact', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'been', 'syndication', 'decades', 'signs', 'waning', 'interest', 'number', 'fan', 'websites', 'devoted', 'series', 'testament', 'enough', 'Germany', 'elsewhere', 'almost', 'cult', 'following', 'rivaling', 'Bond', 'films', 'Paradise', 'almost', 'rite', 'passage', 'many', 'locals', 'Sure', 'much', 'been', 'made', 'how', 'locals', 'were', 'used', 'TV', 'series', 'considering', 'when', 'ran', 'was', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'series', 'also', 'gave', 'start', 'many', 'local', 'acting', 'careers', 'cast', 'frequently', 'sponsored', 'otherwise', 'underwrote', 'many', 'local', 'dramatic', 'productions', 'genuine', 'man', 'principles', 'character', 'portrayed', 'was', 'quietly', 'active', 'local', 'philanthropy', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'loved', 'islands', 'people', 'actually', 'poignancy', 'scenes.The', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'confront', 'issues', 'day', 'head-on', 'course', 'many', 'concerns', 'might', 'seem', 'trite', 'today', 'vantage', 'point', 'others', 'remain', 'pressing', 'soldier', 'returning', 'war', 'case', 'Vietnam', 'soldier', 'unable', 'shake', 'bitterness', 'war', 'Japan', 'environmental', 'protectionism', 'usurpation', 'Hawaiian', 'culture', 'destructive', 'power', 'youth', 'drug', 'culture', 'crime', 'general.I', 'look', 'forward', 'reliving', 'portion', 'adolescence', 'when', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'refreshing', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'unabashedly', 'candid', 'times', 'little', 'corny', 'stilted', 'written', 'need', 'circumvent', 'censor', 'being', 'cop', 'show', 'unrated', 'therefore', 'appropriate', 'older', 'children', 'watch', 'little', 'way', 'gratuitious', 'graphic', 'violence', 'language', ""n't"", 'torrent', 'expletives', 'Sure', 'was', 'never', 'special', 'state', 'police', 'force', 'mentioning', 'HPD', 'headquarters', 'actually', 'small', 'museum', 'lasting', 'tribute', 'show.Now', 'happen', 'know', 'show', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'exhortations', 'wo', ""n't"", 'think', 'odd', 'admit', 'occasion', 'when', 'stroll', 'past', 'Iolani', 'Palace', 'Ilikai', 'Hotel', 'make', 'upward', 'glance', 'see', 'McGarrett', 'looking', 'blinds', 'leaning', 'balcony', 'rail', 'trademark', 'grin']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 1

1039105,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B000LE16VC,Terence Allen,"[8, 8]","Nothing lasts 12 years without having something going for it. In the case of Hawaii Five-O, it easy to dismiss it as a typically television crime drama that got lucky by finding its audience and keeping it. The same could be said for Law and Order. Except, in television years, luck usually runs out after two or three years. Gimmicks get old, the formula is figured out, and sharks are jumped so often they don't even complain.But shows that last five years, much less 12, have to have something besides luck, gimmicks, and great scheduling. Hawaii Five-O had a number of things going for it. First of all, let's be honest. The setting was, and still is so lush and exotic that it is easily intoxicating. Hawaii is beautiful, and most people either live there or want to live there. Filming on location has always been a blessing when it's been done, and probably no more so than on this series.Next, Jack Lord, playing Five-O chief Steve McGarrett, was one of a long line of no-nonsense law enforcement figures.The strength, integrity, and dedication of these kinds of characters cannot be overstated, and these characters will always have lots of fans rooting them on, not unlike Law and Order's Jack McCoy.Finally, watching shows like this is always a treat because you see so many stars that were either big stars enjoying a working Hawaiian vacation, or lots of up and coming stars before they got their big break.

I also have always been infatuated with the Hawaian Islands so I thought what better way to see Hawaii (besides going there) than to watch the TV series that put Hawaii on the map. Known for its stunning visual effects of Hawaii, its sometimes campy yet enjoyable scripts and Jack Lord's perfect hair, ""Hawaii Five O"" has cemented itself as a TV classic that has never gone out of style.Season 1 features the series' full 24 episodes, come uncut and look breathtakingly beautiful as CBS has done a remarkable job in restoring the shows. The series' pilot episode called ""Cocoon"" is included and is produced like a big-feature film with action scenes, a great villin and surpises that will put you on the edge of your seat.Included as well is the rare documentary called ""Emme Tomimbang's Island Moments: Memories of Hawaii Five O"", a 45 minute feature that aired on the NBC Hawaii station KHNL.

It's too bad that line and those scenes are not part of the extras on this DVD.However, it is awesome seeing these first season episodes uncut and remastered. Talk about pristine; the colors and picture quality are jaw droppingly good. This may sound silly, but one aspect of the first season I always enjoyed was the Five-O squad in their offices without their suit jackets on. It made the characters seem more real, if that makes any sense. McGarrett was especially cool in these office scenes because he had the shoulder holster. I was never struck by the characters' wardrobe until I viewed later seasons, possibly from the fourth season on, where the characters were dressed in their full ensembles, even when sitting at their desks! It just looked uncomfortable.Anyway...My favorite first season episodes include: ""Cocoon"" (the 2 hour pilot), ""Full Fathom Five,"" ""And They Painted Daises on His Coffin,"" ""Tiger By the Tail,"" ""Yesterday Died and Tomorrow Won't Be Born"" and ""The Box"" . This DVD  also has  ""Six Kilos"" which was rarely shown in syndication.It's about time this classic police drama is being released on DVD, and you gotta love the opening credits:  Starring Jack Lord, with James MacArthur as ""Danny"", Zulu as ""Kono"", and Kam Fong as ""Chin Ho"".""Be Here, Aloha!""",5,"""Be Here...

This 7 disc set contains the original series pilot ""Cocoon"" and the remaining 24 season one episodes digitally remastered and in spectacular color. The set consists of seven discs stored in 4 slim cases. Paramount/CBS dvd went the distance with the disc packaging and artwork. Other than some minor speckling the episodes look amazing. The video transfer is crisp and the colors are sharp and vibrant. The episodes are presented in full screen format with mono sound. The sound is clean and crisp, but it's too bad that Paramount didn't remaster the sound like they did with ""Mission Impossible"" season one.I have never seen the pilot episode ""Cocoon"" so it was definitely a treat for me to watch and well worth the purchase of this set. Season One of ""Hawaii Five-O"" with it's great writing, memorable characters, theme music and great dialogue is 60's television at it's finest. This show was groundbreaking entertainment and it set the standard for other police shows to follow. They don't make shows like this anymore and probably never will again. The only bonus features included are found on the last disc. I thought the bonus material was fun to watch and informative. I look forward to season two of ""Hawaii Five-O"" and hope that Paramount continues with the same dvd quality as season one.
