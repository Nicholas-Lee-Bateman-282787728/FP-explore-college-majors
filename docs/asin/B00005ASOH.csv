578431,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005ASOH,A. Estes,"[1, 1]","One film that may have been swept under the rug amidst the wave of current '80s nostalgia is ""House."" The fact that it's been forgotten is a probably a good thing seeing as how it is about the only film in its time that hasn't been remade or isn't currently being targeted by Michael Bay or anyone else who would do it harm. In a way, ""House"" is a cult classic that is destined to stay a cult classic forever, and there are many reasons why.The first reason lies in its plot structure. To say the film's biggest weakness lies in its sloppy story-telling would be an understatement; at times, the film flat-out makes no sense. There are no rules when it comes to the supernatural elements of the story; therefore, the film gets away with murder, so to speak.Another reason would be its quirky sense of humor, achieved by its assorted cast. William Katt plays the straight man against the nosy and over-bearing neighbor, played by George Wendt of TV's ""Cheers"". On the other side of the coin, Richard Moll (he being of ""Night Court"" fame) plays the chief bad-guy, glorious special effects make-up job and all, disguising his usual persona all while adding to further amusement when he fails in harassing his former war buddy.Then, of course, we have the creepy yet amusing practical effects which define the film. The monsters or ghosts or whatever you'd like to refer to them as appear to be straight out of someone's nightmare, resembling nothing seen before and often achieved by something as simple as a latex mask. You'll giggle yourself silly as you watch Katt's character struggle with the skanky-looking goblin his ex-wife becomes. The laughs are derived partly because the scenario is so over-the-top and silly but also because the effects by which it is executed are just too good to be true and reminiscent of a time when horror movies had a certain authenticity to them, even when they didn't take themselves too seriously.Rather than go any further into analyzing the film and why it should remain an '80s relic, it must be said that ""House"" is simply a boat-load of good times. Director Steve Miner (""Friday the 13th Part 2"" and ""3-D"")) truly comes into his own with the film, which is both stylish and competently paced (too bad the director crapped out in the '90s). Meanwhile, William Katt carries the film on his shoulders, giving a performance that is both manic and sympathetic. Somewhere amidst the horror and the humor lies a story of redemption, and Katt somehow sells it. Although the film never quite settles on a specific tone or makes much sense throughout, it's still an enjoyable film that will deliver chuckles and jumps time and time again. It's certainly not a film for everyone, and that's the point. For those who prefer their horror off-beat and with a sense of humor, you'll found ""House"" to be worth entering.",4,Home is where the horror is.,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,2844,"['One', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'swept', 'rug', 'wave', 'current', ""'80s"", 'nostalgia', 'House', 'fact', 'been', 'forgotten', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'seeing', 'how', 'only', 'film', 'time', ""n't"", 'been', 'remade', ""n't"", 'currently', 'being', 'targeted', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'harm', 'way', 'House', 'cult', 'classic', 'destined', 'stay', 'cult', 'classic', 'forever', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why.The', 'first', 'reason', 'plot', 'structure', 'say', 'film', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'sloppy', 'story-telling', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'times', 'film', 'flat-out', 'sense', 'are', 'rules', 'when', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'story', 'therefore', 'film', 'away', 'murder', 'so', 'speak.Another', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'achieved', 'assorted', 'cast', 'William', 'Katt', 'straight', 'man', 'nosy', 'over-bearing', 'neighbor', 'played', 'George', 'Wendt', 'TV', 'Cheers', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'Richard', 'Moll', 'being', 'Night', 'Court', 'fame', 'chief', 'bad-guy', 'glorious', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'job', 'disguising', 'usual', 'persona', 'adding', 'further', 'amusement', 'when', 'harassing', 'former', 'war', 'buddy.Then', 'course', 'have', 'creepy', 'yet', 'amusing', 'practical', 'effects', 'define', 'film', 'monsters', 'ghosts', ""'d"", 'like', 'refer', 'appear', 'be', 'straight', 'someone', 'nightmare', 'resembling', 'nothing', 'seen', 'often', 'achieved', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'latex', 'mask', ""'ll"", 'giggle', 'silly', 'watch', 'Katt', 'character', 'struggle', 'skanky-looking', 'goblin', 'ex-wife', 'becomes', 'laughs', 'are', 'derived', 'partly', 'scenario', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'silly', 'also', 'effects', 'executed', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'reminiscent', 'time', 'when', 'horror', 'movies', 'had', 'certain', 'authenticity', 'even', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously.Rather', 'go', 'further', 'analyzing', 'film', 'why', 'should', 'remain', ""'80s"", 'relic', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'House', 'simply', 'boat-load', 'good', 'times', 'Director', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', '2', '3-D', 'truly', 'own', 'film', 'stylish', 'competently', 'paced', 'too', 'bad', 'director', 'crapped', 'out', ""'90s"", 'Meanwhile', 'William', 'Katt', 'film', 'shoulders', 'giving', 'performance', 'manic', 'sympathetic', 'Somewhere', 'horror', 'humor', 'story', 'redemption', 'Katt', 'somehow', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'settles', 'specific', 'tone', 'much', 'sense', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'will', 'deliver', 'chuckles', 'jumps', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'certainly', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'point', 'who', 'prefer', 'horror', 'off-beat', 'sense', 'humor', ""'ll"", 'found', 'House', 'be', 'worth', 'entering']",House
578432,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005ASOH,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[28, 35]","As far as campy ""B"" rated horror/comedy films go, House ranks up there near the top.  First of all, look at the cast.  You have an ensemble of television stars getting into the big screen using this film as their vehicle.  George Wendt and William Katt are prime examples of this.  Their acting level is below minimal standards and you can really tell that they are acting.  You never really see the struggle of Cobb trying to write his manuscript for his next novel while having to deal with the demons in the house.  You never really understand why Wendt is against Katt so adamantly.  You never really get an answer as to why he stayed in that house and dealt with the spirits the way that he did instead of just bolting out the door after the first scream.  There are several questions unanswered and plenty of cheapness to this film, but ... and get this ... that is what makes it phenomenal.Let's take a deeper look at this film.  To begin it is a horror/comedy made in the 80s, which already sets the standard.  The 80s were notorious for brining to light the horror/comedy genre and they made no exception here.  The set and sound are not the best in this film, while the monsters are completely 80s (for lack of a better word).  You can definitely see the differences between gory monsters of today, and those made yesteryears.  There seems to be a focus on the absurd in the 80s, instead of the grotesque and unbelievable of today's standards.  This is a cheesy film, and it was meant to be.  That is definitely something I miss with today's films.  I saw it briefly in Shawn of the Dead, but it still hasn't come full circle yet.  I need a rebirth of this genre.  Less nudity, less gore, and more undeniably 80s monsters.  I believe that people would still flock to see it.  I know I would be in line.  The set, cinematography, and acting were all perfect for this film.  When I watched this movie again with some friends, there were some that had not seen it and jumped on several occasions.  That says to me that it has maintained a fright factor.  You can tell if a horror film has lasted the test of time if nearly 20 years later others are still jumping.What also worked perfectly in this film was the comedy aspect.  I don't know if it was trying to go for the sub-genre of parody, but there were scenes that I saw in this film that reminded me of some of the classics like The Shining, Nightmare on Elm Street, Ghoulies, and Evil Dead.  It was a very good mix that worked exceptionally well in building that extra chuckle whenever Cobb did something you know is absurd.  He is the perfect example of your uneducated hero.  When he should be running outside to regroup and collect his ideas, he is instead running upstairs where the terror is greater.  Whenever he attempted to write, but was constantly interrupted by ghouls, goblins, or even the neighbor, it made me smile.  He was not your average hero, yet somehow I found myself cheering for him at the end.Overall, this was your average ""cult"" horror film that the 80s were notorious for.  If you walk into this film expecting today's standards, you will be disappointed.  If you go into it thinking of what the 80s were like, especially in the horror genre in Hollywood, I think you will be utterly surprised.  I have seen this film several times, and it continues to get better each time I watch it.  Katt does a superb job with the material and experience that he has, and nearly rockets himself into a Bruce Campbell clone.  Well ... almost ... I don't think Campbell's status could ever be compromised!  Enjoy ... scream ... and have a good time.  Just watch out for when that clock hits midnight, you never know what parallel universe may be clumping around in your closet ...BOOOOOOOOOOO!Grade: **** out of *****",4,Our House is a very very very fine house...,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,3792,"['As', 'far', 'campy', 'B', 'rated', 'horror/comedy', 'films', 'go', 'House', 'there', 'top', 'First', 'look', 'cast', 'have', 'ensemble', 'television', 'stars', 'getting', 'big', 'screen', 'using', 'film', 'vehicle', 'George', 'Wendt', 'William', 'Katt', 'are', 'prime', 'examples', 'acting', 'level', 'minimal', 'standards', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'are', 'acting', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'struggle', 'Cobb', 'trying', 'write', 'manuscript', 'next', 'novel', 'having', 'deal', 'demons', 'house', 'never', 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'Wendt', 'Katt', 'so', 'adamantly', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'answer', 'why', 'stayed', 'house', 'dealt', 'spirits', 'way', 'did', 'instead', 'just', 'bolting', 'out', 'door', 'first', 'scream', 'are', 'several', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'plenty', 'cheapness', 'film', 'get', 'what', 'phenomenal.Let', 'take', 'deeper', 'look', 'film', 'begin', 'horror/comedy', 'made', '80s', 'already', 'standard', '80s', 'were', 'notorious', 'brining', 'light', 'horror/comedy', 'genre', 'made', 'exception', 'here', 'set', 'sound', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'monsters', 'are', 'completely', '80s', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'differences', 'gory', 'monsters', 'today', 'made', 'yesteryears', 'be', 'focus', 'absurd', '80s', 'instead', 'grotesque', 'unbelievable', 'today', 'standards', 'cheesy', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'definitely', 'something', 'miss', 'today', 'films', 'saw', 'briefly', 'Shawn', 'Dead', 'still', ""n't"", 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'yet', 'need', 'rebirth', 'genre', 'Less', 'nudity', 'less', 'gore', 'more', 'undeniably', '80s', 'monsters', 'believe', 'people', 'would', 'still', 'flock', 'see', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'line', 'set', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'were', 'perfect', 'film', 'When', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'friends', 'were', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'jumped', 'several', 'occasions', 'maintained', 'fright', 'factor', 'can', 'tell', 'horror', 'film', 'lasted', 'test', 'time', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'later', 'others', 'are', 'still', 'jumping.What', 'also', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'film', 'was', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'trying', 'go', 'sub-genre', 'parody', 'were', 'scenes', 'saw', 'film', 'reminded', 'classics', 'Shining', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Ghoulies', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'mix', 'worked', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'building', 'extra', 'chuckle', 'whenever', 'Cobb', 'did', 'something', 'know', 'absurd', 'perfect', 'example', 'uneducated', 'hero', 'When', 'should', 'be', 'running', 'outside', 'regroup', 'collect', 'ideas', 'instead', 'running', 'upstairs', 'where', 'terror', 'greater', 'Whenever', 'attempted', 'write', 'was', 'constantly', 'interrupted', 'ghouls', 'goblins', 'even', 'neighbor', 'made', 'smile', 'was', 'not', 'average', 'hero', 'somehow', 'found', 'cheering', 'end.Overall', 'was', 'average', 'cult', 'horror', 'film', '80s', 'were', 'notorious', 'walk', 'film', 'expecting', 'today', 'standards', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'go', 'thinking', 'what', '80s', 'were', 'especially', 'horror', 'genre', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'utterly', 'surprised', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'get', 'better', 'time', 'watch', 'Katt', 'superb', 'job', 'material', 'experience', 'nearly', 'rockets', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'clone', 'Well', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Campbell', 'status', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'compromised', 'Enjoy', 'scream', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Just', 'watch', 'out', 'when', 'clock', 'hits', 'midnight', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'parallel', 'universe', 'may', 'be', 'clumping', 'closet', 'BOOOOOOOOOOO', 'Grade', '****', '*****']",House

William Katt (a writer) is trying to tie up some loose ends. He goes to sell his aunt's house carrying the sorrow that his aunt killed herself. (So he has to go through some painful moments of walking through the house.)However, he decides he has some unfinished business and decides to hold off on the selling. (At least for the moment) We are also permitted sympathy for him in that he has lost his son, and that he is separated from his wife. But his wife and he are still on speaking terms, and somehow he get the impression that they may get back together. An especially comical moment is when he is talking to her on the telephone and he turns up the stereo to make it sound like he his having a party.There are some overdone moments, but the story is interesting enough so that we are inclined to forgive that. While trying to resolve the matters of his missing son, he is having flashbacks of his experiences in Vietnam, while he is trying to think of ideas for his new book. (The writer of this may have been familiar with the stream of consciousness technique of writing.) There is also a scene that alludes to Edgar Allen Poe's ""Tell Tale Heart.""George Wendt is an interesting character. He offers some badly needed comic relief; in addition, he may appear to be out of it, but he does offer worthwhile help sometimes. In a light hearted moment, Katt gets a chance at romance.In this story of horror, mystery, and suspense, we have some well placed laughs, and even an interesting soundtrack.

578441,A1GB1Q193DNFGR,B00005ASOH,Bruce Lee Pullen,"[0, 1]","House is a uniquely unpredictably droll haunted house flick that chronicles an ailing creatively challenged horror author's artistic rediscovery as he investigates his recently late-aunt's haunted house. As the novelist's perception of reality becomes increasingly blurred, inanely blemished by unreality, and dispersedly interconnected with the subject matter of his new autobiographical book about the Vietnam War, the author finds himself killing off his estranged wife who's unpredictably been morphing into a monster, capturing monstrosities randomly annoying him from the guest room's closet, or hearing the espondent cries from his dead son. Despite the extremely morbid sounding nature of the House's plot, the film is actually a quite hilarious horror-comedy as it totally exploits your interest in it by erratically buoying its mood between terror and camp so effectively and confidently you can't keep track as to what's going on or how you're feeling as you're watching it. The House is such an awesome curiously innovative little film that contradicts ALL of you're expectations ,while delivering one heck of a revitalizing romp through horror irrelevance. You can't help but be assimilated into its capricious glee.As for the House 2, it's definitely geared more directly towards self-conscious camp and giddy B-Movie conventions by telling a tale of dueling late 19th century corpses bidding for a magical skull. Regardless of its lack of horror, House 2 continues it's predecessor's preoccupation with exuberant unpredictably and immensely amusing comic delirium in the finest tradition of the Evil Dead series.As for the limited 20,000 copies edition, it does contain commentaries and a few interesting editions. However, it's these amazingly fresh horror-camp classics that you should be buying them for.

What I don't quite get is why House's name in this movie is Roger Cobb.But let's forget that for a moment and move onto the plot.Set in the days before House went to med school, ""House"" tells the story of Cobb (played here by the talented William Katt), a Vietnam vet/writer staying in his aunt's house.Now, I have to admit, I liked this aspect of the story.  Every week we see House as this curmudgeon with a penchant for solving the most complex of medical cases.  What we don't see is why he is so difficult to get along with.  Well, for those of us who are veterans of the Vietnam War, we can certainly understand House's short-comings now.I also liked the fact that House was a writer before he decided to become a doctor.  As an aspiring writer myself, I can empathize with wanting to quit the profession altogether and start over.  Perhaps we'll see the writing-side of House come out in future episodes!Unfortunately, that's the only thing I liked about ""House.""  It doesn't take long for the movie to get completely weird.While staying in the house, Cobb's son mysteriously disappears.  That doesn't sound weird to you?  What if I told you that [SPOILER ALERT] the house took him?  That's right, the house that Cobb is staying in is haunted.  The house causes him to have Vietnam flashbacks, monsters start coming out of the closet, and medicine cabinets open up different dimensions.  Like I said - weird.All of that aside, I think it's fascinating that Cobb would later move on with his life and change his name to House.  An interesting choice of surnames, but after watching the movie I'm sure you'll agree it's an appropriate one.While I can't recommend ""House"" to all fans of ""House, M.D.,"" I will say that some of you will glean some new details about your favorite character that you never knew.

In retrospect I had to think about why I liked this flick, because it does have stuff going against it. HOUSE is cheesy and campy, and yet also fun, and I guess maybe it's fun because it's so cheesy and campy. HOUSE is very much a product of the 1980s and this absolutely includes its featured lead William Katt, the Greatest American Hero himself.HOUSE sets itself up to be a sinister horror film with dark psychological overtones. Roger Cobb (Katt) is a popular horror fiction author who's been recently coasting on his past success. Roger's in a slump, and it's not helping that he's been so obsessed with cranking out his Vietnam War memoirs. The writing doldrums go back some time ago to when his kid mysteriously vanished at his aunt's spooky  house. So to recap: languishing career, vanished kid. And, because certain things crop up in threes, Roger's hot actress wife also divorces him.When his eccentric aunt hangs herself, Roger inherits her house and, rather than selling it, Roger decides to live in it for a while, hoping for inspiration to kick in. But an evil house does not a muse make. Soon all the weird stuff starts happening.A lot of the movie is presented as a one-man act for William Katt, broken up by cutaways to Roger's ex-wife and by occasional drop-in visits by his nosy neighbor and his sexy neighbor. For the first half hour or so you sink into William Katt's character as he finds himself tormented by the haunted house, which is somehow dredging up traumatic memories of Roger Cobb's stint in Vietnam. There's a whiff of THE SHINING going on as we see Roger gradually going off the deep end. But then, somewhere along the way, things descend into slapstick territory. And while the story does drum up scattered scares here and there, they're undermined by the painfully obvious rubber monster suits and all the (intentional) goofiness. We get rehashed zaniness that recalls the EVIL DEAD series, but lacking that Sam Raimi's inspired frenzied touch. For a horror movie, the victim body count is practically nil. But the champion killjoy are all those Vietnam flashbacks that feel totally out of place and very dated. To me, these scenes established a jarring effect.So why do I like this movie? I really think that a huge chunk of the reason is that I saw it during its theatrical run when I was a teen, so I'm pulling the nostalgia card. If you're an '80s buff, then you've got William Katt and George Wendt (Norm!! from CHEERS) and Richard Moll (NIGHT COURT) who in this one plays a soldier in Roger's platoon in the flashbacks. For a low budget production HOUSE actually boasts some decent acting. I like that William Katt never breaks character, even though all kinds of crazy shizzy rain down on him, and he takes on this fascinating tunnel vision mentality. You and me, the first time the house does something scary, we're probably out of there so fast there's you and me-shaped dust clouds left behind. But Roger Cobb decides to fight and beat the house at its own game. That is some impressive (and very stupid) brand of singlemindedness. And I even relish the bizarre turn which finds Roger Cobb babysitting a neighbor's young kid.I also enjoy the film's juggling of the serious horror elements and the tongue-in-cheek stuff.

If you are looking for a scary or Gory movie, look elsewhere. However if you have a spare hour and a half and have nothing better to do, then give house a shot. It starts slow, but there are enoguh sight gags to keep you interested. However there are some flashback scenes that are painfully slow, and most of the time not very funny. The acting is pretty damned good though, and their facial expressions are priceless. If you make it half way thorugh there is some pretty cool looking makeup effects in this film. From the monster in the closet to the bloated opaque clown woman. There are some plot problems, which are to be expected in this type of film, but House feels kinda rushed. Everything during the second half of the movie moves very quickly and does little explaining as to what the house is or why it does what it does. Overall this film is a cross between Killer Clowns form outer space and Army of Darkness. Despite all of ist problems the film is still a fun little waste of time, if thats what your in the market for. You probobly won't watch it very often, but its good to pull out around halloween or on a boring weekend.

578453,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,B00005ASOH,Jason N. Mical,"[0, 2]","Perhaps one of the quintessential 1980s horror films, House makes its explosion onto the DVD format in this (relatively unadvertised) Anchor Bay Special/Limited Edition disc.  The digital gurus at Anchor Bay's studios have given us another finely restored film, and the first 20,000 DVDs produced are actual limited editions with a bonus DVD that contains a restored House II: The Second Story.  Fans, be speedy: these two-disc sets aren't going to last long, and this is House II's ONLY anticipated Region 1 release on DVD, ever.  Once it's gone, it's gone.But, is the 2 disc set even worth getting?  House tells the story of Vietnam vet and writer Roger Cobb (William Katt) who, looking for solitude and a break from his ex-wife (Kay Lenz), decides to move into his aunt's old house after she commits suicide.  Coincidentally, this is the same house where Cobb's son disappeared a couple of years ago - apparently one of the deciding factors in the divorce, and Cobb's current writing slump.  After he checks in, all manner of strange things happen, from Vietnam flashbacks to ghostly goings-on.As a horror film, House certainly holds its own against more serious slasher-fare.  Like Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, House doesn't take itself as seriously as other movies in the genre, and the result is an oftentimes humorous piece of work (unintentionally or not).  The horror elements are strong: you are never completely sure if the house is actually causing the events, or if the main character is slowly going insane.  Unfortunately, the story is so disjointed that the main creep value is lost when baddies are revealed too early, and the final sequence turns into an action movie instead of a horror film.  While farces aren't intended to be subtle, the subtle, layered effect created in the first 20 minutes is utterly ruined as soon as we see the monster, and from there on out everything either becomes more stereotypical 80s horror fare, or the comic version of the same.  This problem doesn't render House unwatchable, but it certainly detracts, as if the director couldn't quite make up his mind about what way he wanted the movie to go.The DVD, on the other hand, is fantastic.  The sound, while in mono, is clear and crisp, and the video transfer is remarkable (although anything less from Anchor Bay would be a crime).  The commentary track is loads of fun, and a 12-minute featurette on The Making of House provides a little historical context and amusement, too.  Luckily, Anchor Bay didn't spare the bonus House II disc any of their normal bells and whistles, and again the sound (mono as well) is great along with the near-flawless video.  The bonus disc also contains a full-length commentary which isn't nearly as entertaining as the other, but hey, neither is the movie.  Fans of House (and House II, if anyone is willing to admit to it) will definitely want to get the Limited Edition as soon as possible, because House II is going to be gone for good once it sells out.  Otherwise, if you liked House, and know what to expect from Anchor Bay, you know what to do - and at this price, it's hard not to.",3,Ding Dong!,996969600,"08 5, 2001",2001,3119,"['Perhaps', 'one', 'quintessential', '1980s', 'horror', 'films', 'House', 'explosion', 'DVD', 'format', 'relatively', 'unadvertised', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Special/Limited', 'Edition', 'disc', 'digital', 'gurus', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'studios', 'have', 'given', 'finely', 'restored', 'film', 'first', '20,000', 'DVDs', 'produced', 'are', 'actual', 'limited', 'editions', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'restored', 'House', 'II', 'Second', 'Story', 'Fans', 'be', 'speedy', 'two-disc', 'sets', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'last', 'long', 'House', 'II', 'ONLY', 'anticipated', 'Region', '1', 'release', 'DVD', 'ever', 'gone', 'gone.But', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'even', 'getting', 'House', 'story', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'writer', 'Roger', 'Cobb', 'William', 'Katt', 'who', 'looking', 'solitude', 'break', 'ex-wife', 'Kay', 'Lenz', 'move', 'aunt', 'old', 'house', 'suicide', 'Coincidentally', 'same', 'house', 'where', 'Cobb', 'son', 'disappeared', 'couple', 'years', 'apparently', 'one', 'deciding', 'factors', 'divorce', 'Cobb', 'current', 'writing', 'slump', 'manner', 'strange', 'things', 'happen', 'Vietnam', 'flashbacks', 'ghostly', 'goings-on.As', 'horror', 'film', 'House', 'certainly', 'own', 'more', 'serious', 'slasher-fare', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'House', ""n't"", 'take', 'as', 'seriously', 'other', 'movies', 'genre', 'result', 'oftentimes', 'humorous', 'piece', 'work', 'unintentionally', 'not', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'strong', 'are', 'never', 'completely', 'sure', 'house', 'actually', 'causing', 'events', 'main', 'character', 'slowly', 'going', 'insane', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'so', 'disjointed', 'main', 'creep', 'value', 'lost', 'when', 'baddies', 'are', 'revealed', 'too', 'early', 'final', 'sequence', 'action', 'movie', 'instead', 'horror', 'film', 'farces', 'are', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'subtle', 'subtle', 'layered', 'effect', 'created', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'utterly', 'ruined', 'as', 'soon', 'see', 'monster', 'there', 'out', 'everything', 'more', 'stereotypical', '80s', 'horror', 'fare', 'comic', 'version', 'same', 'problem', ""n't"", 'render', 'House', 'unwatchable', 'certainly', 'director', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'way', 'wanted', 'movie', 'go.The', 'DVD', 'other', 'hand', 'fantastic', 'sound', 'mono', 'clear', 'crisp', 'video', 'transfer', 'remarkable', 'anything', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'would', 'be', 'crime', 'commentary', 'track', 'loads', 'fun', '12-minute', 'featurette', 'Making', 'House', 'little', 'historical', 'context', 'amusement', 'too', 'Luckily', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'did', ""n't"", 'spare', 'bonus', 'House', 'II', 'normal', 'bells', 'whistles', 'again', 'sound', 'mono', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'near-flawless', 'video', 'bonus', 'disc', 'also', 'full-length', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'entertaining', 'other', 'hey', 'movie', 'Fans', 'House', 'House', 'II', 'anyone', 'willing', 'admit', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'get', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'House', 'II', 'going', 'be', 'gone', 'good', 'once', 'out', 'Otherwise', 'liked', 'House', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'price', 'hard', 'not']",House

Although not your average 'haunted house' film, there's plenty of jumps and laughs to be had here. House perhaps isn't the scariest movie around (okay, not even close), but the intent here is not to shock, if you're looking to be entertained for 90 minutes with some wildly funny special effects, a smirking sense of humor and several great performances, look no further than this little winner from 1985.William Katt plays bestselling author Roger Cobb, a writer whose made a living penning gruesome horror novels.  It seems however, of late, Roger has fallen on hard times.  His son was kidnapped right out of his backyard one afternoon, he and his wife (Kay Lenz) are divorced and Cobb has developed quite a case of writers' block.  He's been struggling to get his latest novel written, a story about his personal experiences in Vietnam.  He's got a rapidly approaching deadline to meet and to top it all off, his elderly aunt has committed suicide leaving Cobb to inherit the big, spooky home in which she lived.The house, as it is, is the same home where Cobb's son was abducted from years ago, despite warnings from his aunt claiming the house alive and the culprit behind the abduction, Cobb never took these 'ramblings' very seriously-until now.To combat his demons and get his book written, Roger moves into the house and immediately, strange things begin to happen.  He's attacked by garden tools, there's a creature living in an upstairs closet, a big, purple witch running about and demon children living in the chimney-and this doesn't begin to scratch the surface!  To top it all off, Roger's nosy neighbor (George Wendt of Cheers fame) thinks he's gone insane and keeps a watchful (and comical) eye on him.House is a horror movie, but it's one that will make you laugh more than scream.  It contains a few jumps, but overall, is none too scary.  Where House is strongest perhaps, is in its portrayal of its main character.  Roger Cobb is a fully fleshed out character haunted by demons of his past while frantically attempting to bury them.  It's not until the evils of the house force him to confront his past demons that Roger can begin, once again to assume control of his life.  While House is a horror film, it's also a well written (by Fred Dekker-helmer of Night of the Creeps-what happened to this man?) story of a man obsessed with finding his missing child.House may not be everybody's cup of tea, there are moments which some viewers may find just too silly, others may find it rather dull and too 'dated'.  Genre fans and overall movie goers with an appreciation for a well-written film won't want to miss this film.

About the alien slugs that jump into peoples' mouths?).  Most horror/comedies today focus too much on the comedy angle(like Army Of Darkness) to the point that you've forgotten that it's categorized as a horror film.  &quot;House&quot; manages some genuinely creepy moments to totally make you forget the comedic moments, and on the other side of the coin, some utterly hilarious scenes.  And the comedy in this film isn't so overblown and exaggerated.  It's actually believable most of the time.  William Katt does a helluva job in his role.  He accomplishes a large task carrying the whole film, I mean, he's on camera for 98% of the film.  I wonder why he never got any more big roles after this.  But, all I can say is that I'm very glad that I bought this dvd.  As for &quot;House 2&quot;, it's okay.  It's a comedy totally unrelated to &quot;House.&quot;  It's a guilty pleasure, kinda dumb, but not without entertainment value.",5,100% FUN,1037145600,"11 13, 2002",2002,1503,"['one', 'forgotten', 'gems', 'people', 'younger', 'probably', 'have', 'knowledge', 'remember', 'seeing', 'theater', '86', 'remember', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'theater', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'horror', 'films', 'anymore', 'extremely', 'entertaining', '90', 'minutes', 'wonderful', 'balance', 'horror', 'comedy', 'Actually', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'horror/comedy', 'there', 'great', 'one', '86', 'alien', 'invasion/zombie/axe', 'murderer', 'spoof', 'quot', 'Night', 'Creeps.', 'quot', 'Remember', 'one', 'alien', 'slugs', 'jump', 'peoples', 'mouths', 'Most', 'horror/comedies', 'today', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'comedy', 'angle', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'point', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'categorized', 'horror', 'film', 'quot', 'House', 'quot', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'moments', 'totally', 'make', 'forget', 'comedic', 'moments', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'comedy', 'film', ""n't"", 'so', 'overblown', 'exaggerated', 'actually', 'believable', 'most', 'time', 'William', 'Katt', 'helluva', 'job', 'role', 'large', 'task', 'carrying', 'whole', 'film', 'mean', 'camera', '98', '%', 'film', 'wonder', 'why', 'never', 'got', 'more', 'big', 'roles', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'bought', 'dvd', 'quot', 'House', '2', 'quot', 'okay', 'comedy', 'totally', 'unrelated', 'quot', 'House.', 'quot', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'kinda', 'dumb', 'not', 'entertainment', 'value']",House

A world populated by Killer Clowns from Outer Space and Canabilistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers who lived in Funhouses at Camp Crystal Lake. Late at night I would sneak out into the den at the back of the house and watch those movies that my parents swore would scar me for life with the sound turned down low enough so that I wouldn't be discovered.  This was one of those flicks that got my alarm set for 2am. I haven't seen either of the House movies in a long while but remember watching them with a fondness that &quot;normal&quot; folks would probably relate to The Wizard of Oz on Thanksgiving every year.  Popcorn in a crinkley plastic bag that made too much noise and was covered in orange powder that at the time I assumed was some sort of cheese-like substanceaccompanied by a 2 liter of Jolt soda so I wouldn't fall asleep and be discovered the next morning.  That's how you have to watch these movies.  Late at night, all alone, with the sound turned way down surrounded by junk food hoping you don't get caught.  The plot wasn't important then and isn't important now.  It made no sense anyway.  What makes this movie enjoyable is the absurd black comedy:  The corpses that just won't die no matter what you do to them, The portals that open up without rhyme or reason, the unbelievable bad timing of the neighbors and the jungles of Vietnam that lead to a swimming pool in the back yard.

The movie is about a Vietnam Vet turned author who is writing a book about his Vietnam War experiences as you have likely read. The movie is at once both silly and shocking. Yes the plot is trite and the acting is shallow but on a whole the HOUSE is never lack luster or slow. The plot never plods along. This House is always rocking with some new interdemensional ghoul or porthole to an alternate reality just begging to be explored.I really hate to say this but the way the movie protrays the grandmothers death is a weirdest sort of funny. You must admit for her to live in a house with all these odd, ""Features"" she had to be a unique woman indeed. This is the first movie I have ever where death was made to appear part of the campish fun of the movie.Anyways the house unintentionally ends up helping the Nam Vet author come to terms with with unresolved issues that went back to his service in Veitnam. The Nam Vet had to rescue his kid from a mean bitter crusty old soggy brained zombie like incarnation of one of the men he served with in Vietnam to be rid of his inner demons.I brought this House because, every so often I have a taste for light weird camp homorous horror and this House amply suits my all needs.
