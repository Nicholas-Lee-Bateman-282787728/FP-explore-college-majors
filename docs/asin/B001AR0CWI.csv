1167717,AGYIRZJQZHED9,B001AR0CWI,Elizabeth S,"[14, 14]","Hidden Secrets is one of the best movie plots that focus on Christian living.  It is a real story with real characters.  The actors have done a fine job of bringing life and depth to the story of very different  friends to the deceased character.  The story opens to a funeral of a man who affected the lives of a group of friends as different from each other as any great ensemble cast.  The funeral of Chris, brings many of his friends together who end up sharing how Chris had affected their lives in the best of ways, over a weekend.  Each character deals with individual issues, from homosexuality, to stereotypical judgmental Christian, to a Christian who has fallen away from faith, to a person seeking truth.  This story also addresses the personal bias' that people have of others and opens the eyes of each character in a revealing way that shows how Jesus can touch each individual life and bring peace.  I highly recommend the movie Hidden Secrets and any other movie made by Pure Flix.  These are not your average Christian stories.  Very well made and acted.  I own many of Pure Flix's Christian movies.  I lost my copy, which is why I am buying another to replace it.  A movie you can watch over and over and share with others.

It packed with some good action, lots of drama, comedy, a romance, and some deep thinking about issues. And this group of characters who come together as family and friends of a man just buried, have enough Hidden Secrets in their lives to scare a team of clergy. It pushes the Christian faith, even using scriptures, often Old Testament, or as one of the group who is Jewish (John Schneider-without the Dukes of Hazard car) says, ""We like to call it the ""Only Testament.""Jeremy (David A.R. White plays the lead male role as well as helped produce and write this story) struggles with life and love. Preacher (Reginald Vel Johnson) can say more in a facial expression than many clergy say in a sermon. Tracy Melchior plays the deceased's sister Sherry, who is also a former girlfriend of Jeremy, fits the role perfectly and every so often gives expressions and looks that you will swear is Julia Roberts as a blond. Really well played roles by all, I'm impressed, as not all Christian films turn out this well. Another role that must be mentioned, since it is omitted on the DVD box is the hypocritical Rhonda, the in your face, scripture quoting, issue advocate, played by Autumn Paul so well you get fed up with Rhonda's almighty attitude even knowing it's just acting.Feature does have SUBTITLES.There are a few deleted scenes and a behind the scenes featurette as bonus. They always claim the trailers to be bonus, but we all know they are ads.Solid Christian film, with a message. And fun (funny) too. Plenty of serious, but always followed by more humor.

This would be a group of friends I would want to hang out with compared to the cynical secular group in Big Chill though. In ""Hidden Secrets"", I can relate a lot with a few of the characters: primarily Jeremy and Anthony. Rhonda was hilarious and pathetic at the same time. Gary's skepticism is something we in Christendom hear often, in differing versions. I liked the vulnarability of Michael as well. And the final scene in the church is worth the price of the movie! Just as in David White's ""Encounter"", each part represents a character that is stereotypical with Christianity and needs to be addressed or confronted. This movie, just like 'Encounter', does this very well. In addition to watching the interaction of each of the friends (brought together with the death of the 'friend' that was the link with each of them--just like ""Big Chill""), I loved the people themselves. I have/had a group just like this and love them just like the people in this story love each other. At the end of the movie they part wiser. This is a better movie than I thought it would be.

I really don't think under 20 yrs of age would really like it either.This movie is a good portayal of ""forgiveness"" and how ""things just happen"" when you are trying to serve God and the ""pull"" that you feel wanting to be in the secular world and join in with others that are of the world.There is a few ""chuckles"" in this movie but my no means could it be called a comedy -in ANY sense. It is a drama. You can actually see Jeremy's girlfriend wrangle a ""stay"" with his ex--i know you have met women like that. There is only a few things that I thought strange was the bar scene (out of all the scriptures that were being thrown around-- no one even came up with the scripture -""to abstain from the apperance of evil"" when that scene came up). They acted like it was perfectly fine for christians to go to a bar -even if they are not drinking--little out there for me on that. But overall I ENJOYED watching this movie. The sound could have been a mite better but -hey at least it had a good message and no cursing.

My expectations weren't too high for it being much more than an average movie, but boy was I pleasantly surprised!  What a really top-notch Christian movie it turned out to be!  The acting, humor, storyline and Christian message were all superb.  I liked it so well that I went online and bought 6 copies of it to share with friends.I would have categorize this movie as a real sleeper, at least personally, as I can't believe I had never heard of it.  I would have to put it in the same company of some really good Christian movies, such as ""Fireproof"" and ""Facing the Giants.""
