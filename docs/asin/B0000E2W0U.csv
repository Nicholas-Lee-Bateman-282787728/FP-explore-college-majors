780927,A23KUCXWHBCPT6,B0000E2W0U,"Ceferino Lamb ""RenoHuskerDu""","[3, 3]","I think I own every PMG release, as well as Pat with anyone else. I even have Zero Tolerance, and the one where he backs up Joni Mitchell. It's the fattest and most cherished part of my music collection. This DVD is another winner, and possibly the most stunning display of musical beauty and skill to date.Here Pat trots out three new backing band members, each of which could surely have successful solo careers sooner or later. They're that good. We first heard these guys play on the Speaking of Now CD, now we get to see them play. Pat must be very confident to surround himself with so many excellent musicians, but then he probably received his Doctorate of music degree when he was still in diapers (grin).The Tokyo crowd is a bit sedate, so the camera does not play on them much. All the better, as we get to see excellent closeups of the various musicians playing intense passages, instead of seeing the crowd. I wish the cameragrapher had not done any MTV-ish fast video cuts, but at least there are not that many. Most edits are calmly paced.The music sounds a bit better to me when I play it in 5ch stereo instead of Dolby. Some might call that heresy, maybe it's just my Yamaha receiver that's not as good as the best decoders.I'm curious about the band members that left, i.e.; why. They were no slouches. I see Paul Wertico is on his own. Hadn't Paul been drumming PMG since the ECM days? Seems a shame to leave a legend behind.In any case, this is a must-buy for Pat Metheny fans, and a good introduction to PM for anyone who appreciates extreme-skill jazz rock. I couldn't disagree more with the official Amazon review. Even if you don't particularly like the video, you can still turn off the TV and enjoy the good mix of new and old PMG tunes. Perhaps Sam Graham was just trying to stir us up so we'd write more reviews.",5,"Amazing music, stunning musicians, quiet crowd",1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,1840,"['think', 'own', 'PMG', 'release', 'as', 'well', 'Pat', 'anyone', 'else', 'even', 'have', 'Zero', 'Tolerance', 'one', 'where', 'up', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'fattest', 'most', 'cherished', 'part', 'music', 'collection', 'DVD', 'winner', 'possibly', 'most', 'stunning', 'display', 'musical', 'beauty', 'skill', 'date.Here', 'Pat', 'trots', 'out', 'three', 'new', 'backing', 'band', 'members', 'could', 'surely', 'have', 'successful', 'solo', 'careers', 'sooner', 'later', ""'re"", 'good', 'first', 'heard', 'guys', 'play', 'Speaking', 'Now', 'CD', 'now', 'get', 'see', 'play', 'Pat', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'confident', 'surround', 'so', 'many', 'excellent', 'musicians', 'then', 'probably', 'received', 'Doctorate', 'music', 'degree', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'diapers', 'grin', 'Tokyo', 'crowd', 'bit', 'sedate', 'camera', 'not', 'play', 'much', 'better', 'get', 'see', 'excellent', 'closeups', 'various', 'musicians', 'playing', 'intense', 'passages', 'instead', 'seeing', 'crowd', 'wish', 'cameragrapher', 'had', 'not', 'done', 'MTV-ish', 'fast', 'video', 'cuts', 'least', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'Most', 'edits', 'are', 'calmly', 'paced.The', 'music', 'bit', 'better', 'when', 'play', '5ch', 'stereo', 'instead', 'Dolby', 'might', 'call', 'heresy', 'maybe', 'just', 'Yamaha', 'receiver', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'decoders.I', ""'m"", 'curious', 'band', 'members', 'left', 'i.e', 'why', 'were', 'slouches', 'see', 'Paul', 'Wertico', 'own', 'Had', ""n't"", 'Paul', 'been', 'drumming', 'PMG', 'ECM', 'days', 'shame', 'leave', 'legend', 'behind.In', 'case', 'must-buy', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'fans', 'good', 'introduction', 'PM', 'anyone', 'who', 'extreme-skill', 'jazz', 'rock', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'official', 'Amazon', 'review', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'video', 'can', 'still', 'turn', 'off', 'TV', 'enjoy', 'good', 'mix', 'new', 'old', 'PMG', 'tunes', 'Perhaps', 'Sam', 'Graham', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'stir', 'up', 'so', ""'d"", 'write', 'more', 'reviews']",N/A
780928,A35IF873PPAMFZ,B0000E2W0U,"Jeff Barnaby ""Jeff Barnaby""","[3, 4]","Pat Metheny, like many Jazz musicians, is not for everybody -- especially those brought up on radio music.  Personally I love a lot of what he does and what he has to offer a lister.  While he enjoys taking his listeners on what can sometimes be long arduous journeys that may not be necessary, rarely will someone who appreciates music in its truest form have so many opportunities to hear something that they have never heard before.  But with Metheny, it's not so much about hearing him play as it is seeing him play.  He is seriously into his playing in a way that few guitarists are.  And that is what makes this DVD special.The DVD features the concert only, no interviews or extras.  In this case, it is more than enough.  The concert starts with Metheny alone playing his solo acoustic version of Last Train Home. And it is well worth listening to.  It is quintessential Metheny in a lot of ways, ambient, complex, and filled with deceptive resolutions, particularly one towards the end.  Listen to it, you'll know it when you hear it.  Proof, The Gathering Sky, and Insensatez are other nice tracks that are well suited for general listening.  Those that enjoy Metheny in his more bazaar and chaotic moments should enjoy A Place In This World, Scrap Metal, and The Roots of Coincidence.  And those that run when they hear Metheny's name should promptly exit the room during these tracks.One cannot talk about The Pat Metheny Group without mentioning Lyle Mays on piano and keyboards.  Personally, the more I listen to Metheny, the more I wonder which one I like more, Pat or Lyle.  It's a close call, but since both are fantastic I don't worry much about it.  Mays' playing is nicely showcased throughout the concert.  While all of the supporting musicians are fantastic, it's Lyle Mays who really make a lot of the music happen.Speaking of the supporting musicians, this DVD also features some of the most moving vocal work I have ever heard from Richard Bona.  The two songs that showcase his voice are You and On Her Way.  Listen to these.  They will change your life for the better.  I usually do not respond to the male voice.  But there is something about Bona singing in his native tongue (Cameroon) that positively angelic, haunting, and beautiful. Again, listen to these songs.  And, as if they needed more, both transition nicely into Metheny's guitar playing.  Bona is primarily a Bass player.  However in the Metheny Group the Bass duties are covered by longtime Metheny Bassist Steve Rodby.  Bona plays a variety of instruments throughout the concert including acoustic guitar, percussion, and brass.  When Metheny introduces his band members by instrument at the shows end he appropriately credits, ""Richard Bona on Everything.""As a rather crude guitarist myself I have always know about Metheny and gave him some brief listening time, but always found the work too complicated.  This DVD really went a long way towards making me a Pat Metheny fan.  As I mentioned earlier, one needs to see Metheny play as well as opposed to just hearing him play.  For those wanting to take that step, this DVD comes highly recommended.  It should have no trouble earning a spot amongst your favorite concert DVDs.",5,Brilliant Music,1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,3222,"['Pat', 'Metheny', 'many', 'Jazz', 'musicians', 'not', 'everybody', 'especially', 'brought', 'up', 'radio', 'music', 'Personally', 'love', 'lot', 'what', 'what', 'offer', 'lister', 'taking', 'listeners', 'what', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'long', 'arduous', 'journeys', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'necessary', 'rarely', 'will', 'someone', 'who', 'music', 'truest', 'form', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'opportunities', 'hear', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Metheny', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'hearing', 'play', 'seeing', 'play', 'seriously', 'playing', 'way', 'few', 'guitarists', 'are', 'what', 'DVD', 'special.The', 'DVD', 'concert', 'only', 'interviews', 'extras', 'case', 'more', 'enough', 'concert', 'Metheny', 'alone', 'playing', 'solo', 'acoustic', 'version', 'Last', 'Train', 'Home', 'well', 'worth', 'listening', 'quintessential', 'Metheny', 'lot', 'ways', 'ambient', 'complex', 'filled', 'deceptive', 'resolutions', 'particularly', 'one', 'end', 'Listen', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'hear', 'Proof', 'Gathering', 'Sky', 'Insensatez', 'are', 'other', 'nice', 'tracks', 'are', 'well', 'suited', 'general', 'listening', 'enjoy', 'Metheny', 'more', 'bazaar', 'chaotic', 'moments', 'should', 'enjoy', 'A', 'Place', 'World', 'Scrap', 'Metal', 'Roots', 'Coincidence', 'run', 'when', 'hear', 'Metheny', 'name', 'should', 'promptly', 'exit', 'room', 'tracks.One', 'can', 'not', 'talk', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'Group', 'mentioning', 'Lyle', 'Mays', 'piano', 'keyboards', 'Personally', 'more', 'listen', 'Metheny', 'more', 'wonder', 'one', 'more', 'Pat', 'Lyle', 'close', 'call', 'are', 'fantastic', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'much', 'Mays', 'playing', 'nicely', 'showcased', 'concert', 'supporting', 'musicians', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Lyle', 'Mays', 'who', 'really', 'make', 'lot', 'music', 'happen.Speaking', 'supporting', 'musicians', 'DVD', 'also', 'most', 'moving', 'vocal', 'work', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Richard', 'Bona', 'two', 'songs', 'showcase', 'voice', 'are', 'Her', 'Way', 'Listen', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'better', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'respond', 'male', 'voice', 'something', 'Bona', 'singing', 'native', 'tongue', 'Cameroon', 'positively', 'angelic', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'Again', 'songs', 'needed', 'more', 'transition', 'nicely', 'Metheny', 'guitar', 'playing', 'Bona', 'primarily', 'Bass', 'player', 'However', 'Metheny', 'Group', 'Bass', 'duties', 'are', 'covered', 'longtime', 'Metheny', 'Bassist', 'Steve', 'Rodby', 'Bona', 'variety', 'instruments', 'concert', 'including', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'percussion', 'brass', 'When', 'Metheny', 'band', 'members', 'instrument', 'shows', 'end', 'appropriately', 'Richard', 'Bona', 'Everything', 'rather', 'crude', 'guitarist', 'have', 'always', 'know', 'Metheny', 'gave', 'brief', 'listening', 'time', 'always', 'found', 'work', 'too', 'complicated', 'DVD', 'really', 'went', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'fan', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'one', 'see', 'Metheny', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'opposed', 'just', 'hearing', 'play', 'wanting', 'take', 'step', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'should', 'have', 'trouble', 'earning', 'spot', 'favorite', 'concert', 'DVDs']",N/A
780929,A32ZNPZDXOK609,B0000E2W0U,Jeff Tischer,"[3, 3]","I am a hit and miss Metheny fan. I think some of his music is excellent and some just loses me in the voice/synthesizer ooo-aaa sea. However, this is a superb performance even though it contains a few elevator music tunes.It starts with the accoustic guitar piece ""Last Train Home"" done solo that is really awesome. Next it rolls into this insanely fast, million note jazz jam with Pat and the drummer. At this point I was impressed and realized Pat's a better guitar player than I thought, and the drummer is awesome. Then he rolls on the rest of his band. I'll just make comments on some of my favorites: The next song that really grabs me is ""Proof"". It has great solos by Pat and Cuong. ""How Insensitive"" is next and is with the trio - Pat, Steve and Antonio. This contains some really beautiful playing by Pat. Next song that catches my ear is ""A Place in the World"". I like the main melody line. ""On Her Way"" has a really cool intro done by Richard Bona using voice, delay and various odds and ends that he layers together. Next Pat plays this solo song on this guitar that has 4 guitars in one - looks like it includes a sitar and 2 harp guitars.All in all, this group delivers a very dynamic and complex performance. I'm especially impressed with Antonio and Richard. I'm no drummer but I think Antonio is an awesome jazz percussionist - he plays these complex syncopated patterns on cymbals and drums that totally lay in a groove and liven up the music. Richard adds in many great voice parts and effects and accompaniment that rounds out the performance.My only disappointment was that Pat didn't talk at all, or even acknowledge his band at the conclusion of the show. Come on guys, come up front and take a bow and show some love.The audio quality of the DVD is high and it sounds good on a good 2 channel stereo system. The video quality and editing is pretty good too.

First of all the Pat Metheny Group's concert performances are usually stronger than the studio versions.I enjoyed the recording and the live renditions here are in many ways a little more interesting.  I also enjoyed the outstanding rendition of ""How Insensitive"" with Pat in a quartet format with Lyle, Antonio and Steve.  His guitar just sang out through the auditorium.An interesting abbreviated verstion of ""Are You Going With Me?"" with Pat on Pikasso guitar and Cuong Vu would'be been better if they had continued on through with the group version, given the new line up, which offered new dynamics.Why only four stars?  Well, the vocal aspect which has gone on for quite a while even with a new line up, is a little worn.Cuong Vu and Antonio Sanchez are two very important and essential additions to the group and it's evident here.  Both have become integral to the group sound.  Sanchez is just out and out the best drummer that the group has ever had.  Vu is stretching and redefining the use of the trumpet on jazz and contemporary music, with his tone, his breathing technique and conceptualizations which are now becoming part of the group vocabulary.",4,"Embellished renditions of ""Speaking of Now"" plus more",1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,1350,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'editorial', 'reviewer', 'comment', 'have', 'audio', 'CD', 'would', 'not', 'need', 'purchase', 'this.This', 'not', 'carbon', 'copy', 'numbers', 'rendition', 'recording', 'First', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'Group', 'concert', 'performances', 'are', 'usually', 'stronger', 'studio', 'versions.I', 'enjoyed', 'recording', 'live', 'renditions', 'here', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'outstanding', 'rendition', 'How', 'Insensitive', 'Pat', 'quartet', 'format', 'Lyle', 'Antonio', 'Steve', 'guitar', 'just', 'sang', 'out', 'auditorium.An', 'interesting', 'abbreviated', 'verstion', 'Are', 'Going', 'Me', 'Pat', 'Pikasso', 'guitar', 'Cuong', 'Vu', ""would'be"", 'been', 'better', 'had', 'continued', 'group', 'version', 'given', 'new', 'line', 'up', 'offered', 'new', 'dynamics.Why', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'Well', 'vocal', 'aspect', 'gone', 'while', 'even', 'new', 'line', 'up', 'little', 'worn.Cuong', 'Vu', 'Antonio', 'Sanchez', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'important', 'essential', 'additions', 'group', 'evident', 'here', 'have', 'become', 'integral', 'group', 'sound', 'Sanchez', 'just', 'out', 'best', 'drummer', 'group', 'ever', 'had', 'Vu', 'stretching', 'redefining', 'use', 'trumpet', 'jazz', 'contemporary', 'music', 'tone', 'breathing', 'technique', 'conceptualizations', 'are', 'now', 'becoming', 'part', 'group', 'vocabulary']",N/A

If you are unfamiliar with Bona or Vu, then you wouldn't understand the point. They are every bit the match and in many ways better than any other 2 guys Metheny and Mays and Rodby usually have standing in the back.Trouble is, Richard Bona is an extraordinary songwriter who could have opened PMG to an entirely new world, and Vu is the most individually creative and original trumpet player in jazz since Miles Davis. Vu's own discs (PURE&lt; BOUND&lt; COME PLAY WITH ME) are not for the feint of heart and certainly are not likely to pop up on any smooth jazz playlist. It's edgy, Asian fired and bold commanding music. Bona has an African sense of rhythm and seduction in his bass playing and singing that is entirely hypnotic be it on his own CDs (REVERENCE) or in partnership with like-minded explorative souls (Huong Thanh's DRAGONFLY).And therein lies the problem. Give Metheny credit for reaching out to 2 very dramatically different musicians than he normally has in the back, but perhaps Mays and Rodby felt threatened and closed ranks. There is little evidence that Bona and Vu are any different than the usual back up cast.Nonetheless, this is a dramatically better group effort than the studio CD. And thankfully, we are spared the inane observations of musicians on the road extolling the virtues of being on a lucrative tour and how that has enlightened them. Indeed.Instead, the film begins with Metheny on baritone guitar essaying &quot;Last Train Home.&quot; It is absoluetly wonderful. The proceedings move into group gear thereafter and it is a terrific show that covers a gentle bossa nova as only Metheny can, plus the crowd pleaser &quot;Are You Going With Me&quot; and a strong cross selection from IMAGINARY DAY and SPEAKING OF NOW.The filmwork is terrific, even if Pat does look like he's added some pudge to the college boy looks he has always sported. Happens to all of us. You do get a sense of what Vu and Bona could do for this band, and with talk that the same lineup is ready to release a second studio CD, perhaps the reins will be released.Inspite of my carping, which really only matters if you have an interest in the solo releases of Bona and Vu, this is a terrifc concert that you'll enjoy a lot.

780935,A1RD2TSQ2IE5LW,B0000E2W0U,Steven Sabin,"[23, 23]","Several weeks ago, I posted a review of the PMG's ""We Live Here"" DVD and remarked that many of the songs performed live by the group on the DVD were almost indistinguishable from their studio performance on the CD of the same title.  The selection of songs on the DVD also closely mirrored those on the CD.  With that DVD, the only thing you are really getting is the chance to see the performers (not just hear them).  You're also treated to some short interviews from the band's members.In contrast, this DVD is a significant departure from the CD of the same title.  Although 7 of the 9 songs from the CD are included here, we're also treated to 9 other songs.  Overall it's a very different experience from the CD, and for that reason alone I can recommend this DVD.  But there are plenty of other reasons as well (particularly the last track).As with other PMG live concerts captured on DVD, the audio is outstanding.  As on the  ""We Live Here"" DVD, this concert was recorded live in Tokyo and appears to use essentially the same videography team.  The videography was a bit better this time around, but frankly it's nothing special and it's the audio rather than video that makes these DVDs worthwhile.  My primary interest in watching, rather than just listening, was to get a better feel for the performers themselves...what they look like, how they interact with each other and their instruments, and who plays what on various songs.One thing I liked about this DVD compared to ""We Live Here"" was that it captured a feel for the performance better, abandoning the annoyingly abrupt segues and interspersed interviews, and just letting the music roll exactly as if you were at the concert.  It felt more cohesive to me.PMG newcomers Richard Bona and Cuong Vu are smokin' here and each brings his own influences that, while retaining that classic sound we've come to expect from the PMG, also evolve it into something that reflects their fingerprints as well.Bona, originally from Cameroon, is a truly gifted performer and were there nothing else worthwhile on the video, I'd still recommend it just to see him.  His fretless bass/vocal scat solo on ""Song for Bilbao"" is phenomenal and an otherwise docile crowd comes alive for it.  Second only to Pat himself, Bona is featured numerous times on the video as a spotlight performer.  This guy is a major talent.  He plays too many instruments to mention here.  Suffice to say, they all play a part in giving a full, intricate sound to the group.As a trumpet player myself, I was particularly impressed with Vu.  I remarked elsewhere that his playing reminds me of a minimalist painting - nothing wasted, everything counts.  He reminds me of the proverbial ""man of few words.""  When he speaks, you're advised to listen...he's got something to say, something worth hearing.  His playing often has a mesmerizing, haunting quality to it - sometimes almost like the midnight keening of a bird over the lake.  It's also a very mellow sound, not unlike a flugelhorn in some ways.  And as with previous incarnations of the PMG where the players outside ""core"" members of the group played a multitude of instruments, Vu adds to the sonic texture of the group with things like the marimba, bells, vocals, and percussion.Next, let's talk about the drums.  As a Paul Wertico fan, I was not sure what to expect from Antonio Sanchez.  But let's put it this way: I was not disappointed.  He knows his way around a drum set.  Big time.  I enjoyed his playing every bit as much as Wertico.  Actually seeing him play, rather than just listening, was interesting for me.  He's an extremely serious guy.  Wertico strikes me as more of a ""free spirit"" when he plays - having fun, a bit of a wild child.  In contrast, with Sanchez you get the impression of somebody at work ... almost a Carl's Jr. ""don't bother me - I'm drumming"" vibe eminates from the guy.  He takes his craft very, very seriously.  And he's very, very good at it.  We're treated to a tasty solo from him on the last track, ""Song for Bilbao.""  It's the epitome of what I think of when I think ""jazz.""As usual, Rodby is rock-solid on the bass.  When you take the time to tune out the rest of the instruments and just listen to the bass lines, he's as much a driving force in grooving the band as Sanchez.  On one of the songs, ""Roots of Coincidence,"" Rodby uses the bow on the upright bass, rather than the usual plucking - giving a symphonic-like sound to an especially dramatic section of the piece.Lyle Mays as usual is terrific and he solos quite a few times on this DVD.  Never known as being a real animated fellow, he does manage to crack a smile or two and lets us know that behind the poker face there lives somebody who really does enjoy what he does for a living.  I've spoke of his talents in my other reviews, and won't repeat them here.  Bottom line: he and Metheny form one of the most prolific and talented teams in jazz today, and Mays is huge part of what makes the PMG special.  He even picks up the guitar and joins Pat for one of the tracks (""On Her Way"")...I didn't even know Mays played the instrument.Striped-shirt Metheny himself spends quite a bit of time on acoustic instruments on this DVD, and I have remarked before on his ability to deliver a poetic, poignant experience on those instruments.  He does so here on numerous occasions.  We even get to see that really strange-looking custom-made 42-string guitar commissioned by Pat to Canadian instrument maker Linda Manzer - dubbed the Pikasso guitar - that sounds like a cross between a zither and a sitar.  He uses it on ""Are You Going With Me"" and it sounds so different than the version on the album ""Offramp"" that I had trouble recognizing it was the same tune.  The same can be said for many of the other 8 songs that appear on this DVD and aren't from the ""Speaking of Now"" CD.  They appear on other PMG CDs, but you have to listen carefully because they are orchestrated and performed totally differently here.  They feel like entirely new songs rather than old friends.  One song in particular, ""Roots of Coincidence"" has moments that have a distinctly hard rock feel to them - something I've never heard from Metheny before.All in all, I enjoyed the DVD.  If you're a Metheny fan, this DVD is worth checking out.  You'll get things here you won't get elsewhere, not even on the CD of the same title.  If you're new to the PMG, it's worth noting that the selections on this DVD were a bit more eclectic than what you'll find on most of the group's CDs, so you might want to listen to some of their other CDs before rendering an overall verdict on their music.  I recommend ""Still Life Talking.""  It's their all-time best seller and I've never met anyone who doesn't like it.In closing, my pick of the litter for the DVD was the last track: ""Song for Bilbao.""  It captures the signature PMG sound, putting them squarely in that sweet spot where they groove the best.  The tune showcases the whole band, including a Gillespie-like solo from Vu, an amazing bass/vocal scat from Bona that I already mentioned above, and a chance for Sanchez to really show us his chops.  I must have played that track 10 times in a row and still couldn't get enough of it.  Indeed, that one alone was worth the price of admission as far as I'm concerned.  If for no other reason, get the DVD so you can experience that tune.",4,You gotta hear the last track...SWEET,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,7394,"['Several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'posted', 'review', 'PMG',
