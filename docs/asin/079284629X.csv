But unlike the other aforementioned series, this one didn't make any money.""Candyman 2 - Farewell to the Flesh"" could have been a great horror movie if the filmmakers had actually researched the first movie. There are many plot points (none of which I will spoil here) that contradict what was stated clearly in the first film. But that is the least of this movie's problems. The acting and direction is sub-standard, even for a horror sequel. I went into this movie with the best expectations, hoping that it would further explore the urban legend. What I got was Candyman (without the creepy rasp of the first film, now just speaking in monotone) killing everybody we meet. To give credit where it is due, they gave Candyman more of a human identity, but it wasn't a very good attempt.While sequels usually have better special effects, ""Candyman 2"" is actually a step down from the original. Despite a few bloody moments, most of the murders are laugable. I found Candyman to be scarier when we didn't see him as much.I loved the first ""Candyman"" movie, and consider it to be the last really good horror movie made, in that it made something original.

It lacks the atmosphere, the charge, and the emotional depth of the first Candyman film. At times it seems like a worthless blood bath.However, despite lacking in these qualities, it is not devoid of them. The plot is taken to New Orleans, the birthplace of Candyman. The first line, said by carry-over character Dr. Purcell, says it all: ""He died for love."" This opening sequence sets the mood for the rest of the film. Candyman's fatal love affair is the focus of this movie. His need to justify his existence is toned down in this one, but keeps him coming back to kill again. Adding to the romantic angle of the Candyman story, but lacking in the emotional content needed to convey this story, Candyman 2's beauty lies in the underlying themes themselves, not in the conveyance of these themes.This DVD is one step beyond the first in that it has director's commentary.

155723,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,079284629X,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","After the death of her father and her brother's arrest, Annie is left to uncover her family's hidden past, which will bring her face to face with the supernatural killer Candyman! CANDYMAN 2 is, in every way, an admirable sequel. It not only expands upon the legend of Daniel Robitaille, the Candyman, but it does so with a continued style and sophistication that typically goes unseen in a film of its kind. The colorful Cajun setting gives Candyman a wonderful new world to haunt. New Orleans always has a mysterious aura about it, and a history that reaches out from the streets and buildings. Director Bill Condon taps in to this to produce a number of highly atmospheric moments, from the Candyman's pursuit of Annie through the chaotic streets of Mardi Gras to the retelling of his origin story and the significance of the mirror. Annie is played gracefully by Kelly Rowan, who creates a character that is quite unlike Helen from the original. Rowan is sweet and soft-spoken, afraid to find out the horrifying truth, but like Helen, she is driven by an undying need to know and a bloody fate that draws her to the Candyman. CANDYMAN 2 does inevitably give in to its Slasher roots, with more blood and a higher body count than before. The major distraction, however, is the glaring sound design that cheapens the mood with obnoxious jump scares. Despite a few underlying discrepancies, CANDYMAN 2 proves to be a worthwhile sequel that holds up well against the original.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,ILHM Reviews Candyman 2,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1506,"['death', 'father', 'brother', 'arrest', 'Annie', 'left', 'uncover', 'family', 'hidden', 'past', 'will', 'bring', 'face', 'face', 'supernatural', 'killer', 'Candyman', 'CANDYMAN', '2', 'way', 'admirable', 'sequel', 'not', 'only', 'legend', 'Daniel', 'Robitaille', 'Candyman', 'so', 'continued', 'style', 'sophistication', 'typically', 'unseen', 'film', 'kind', 'colorful', 'Cajun', 'setting', 'Candyman', 'wonderful', 'new', 'world', 'haunt', 'New', 'Orleans', 'always', 'mysterious', 'aura', 'history', 'out', 'streets', 'buildings', 'Director', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'taps', 'produce', 'number', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'moments', 'Candyman', 'pursuit', 'Annie', 'chaotic', 'streets', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'retelling', 'origin', 'story', 'significance', 'mirror', 'Annie', 'played', 'gracefully', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', 'who', 'character', 'quite', 'Helen', 'original', 'Rowan', 'sweet', 'soft-spoken', 'afraid', 'find', 'out', 'horrifying', 'truth', 'Helen', 'driven', 'undying', 'need', 'know', 'bloody', 'fate', 'Candyman', 'CANDYMAN', '2', 'inevitably', 'give', 'Slasher', 'roots', 'more', 'blood', 'higher', 'body', 'count', 'before', 'major', 'distraction', 'however', 'glaring', 'sound', 'design', 'mood', 'obnoxious', 'jump', 'scares', 'few', 'underlying', 'discrepancies', 'CANDYMAN', '2', 'proves', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'sequel', 'up', 'well', 'original.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

She soon discovers a deep secret in her families past that is directly connected to the man and the event that started the legend.What I liked about this movie was that it went deeper into the legend of the Candyman.

155726,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,079284629X,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[22, 22]","Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh takes up the story of the Candyman legend and runs with it, giving us a much greater understanding of the man who would become the hook-gutting avenger of wronged souls; it offers a short and respectable summary of the first movie and then proceeds not to redo what has happened before but to carve its own name indelibly in the flesh of cinematic horror.  I think this movie stands as a testament to proper sequel-making in the horror movie genre.I love the opening sequence of this film.  The smarmy academic professor who is an expert on the Candyman but does not believe in him (the same man who needled Helen as she worked on her project in the original movie) is speaking about his new book in a New Orleans bookstore.  Naturally, he proves his disbelief by theatrically calling out Candyman's name five times in front of his own reflection.  Let's just say he ends up a convert to the Candyman religion.  Then we meet Annie Tarrant (Kelly Rowan), a devoted schoolteacher in a poor neighborhood of town.  Her brother is accused of killing the lecturing professor, but Annie does not believe his own statements of guilt.  She believes something about her father's death is responsible for her brother's unexplainable behavior.  That death, we learn, precipitated an enduring tragedy in the Tarrant family.  Annie's mother is dying of cancer and seems to be holding something back from her questioning daughter.  Annie herself, foolishly trying to prove to her frightened students that Candyman isn't real, calls him, and then things really get ugly.  People die, many of them Tarrants, and the Candyman seems to engage in some sort of romantic courtship of Annie.  Tarrant family secrets are eventually revealed, and in the process we get a bird's-eye view of the suffering inflicted upon Daniel Robitaille a century earlier - for those who don't know, he was lynched for having loved a white woman; his right hand was cut off with a rusty blade, and then he was smeared with honey and left at the mercy (or lack of it) of a whole colony of angry bees.By the end of the movie, Candyman is not some horrible monster bent on destruction just because he enjoys gutting people; he is quite real, and his humanity shines through the robes of gore he has wrapped himself in over the decades.  If you saw off his hand, will he not jam a hook in the stub of his arm and start gutting people?  If you scratch his face, will not hordes of bees pour forth from his body?  I love Candyman; he really is one of the most complex, sympathetic yet disturbing ""monsters"" wandering the horror universe today.  Much of the credit for his power must go to Tony Todd, who portrays him brilliantly.  Maybe the ending of this movie leaves a little bit to be desired, but the journey features some pretty decent gore and a lot of almost philosophical horror ruminations.  If you want to call Candyman, go ahead; he's real enough to me that I'm not going to do it.",5,Come . . .

The myth becomes history. We slowly rediscover the real slave who was lynched by the white planters just after the Civil War. The heroin is the direct descendant of him and Carolyne, his white lover. He was born on the plantation of the heroin of the film, in the slave quarters. And the myth is now entertwined with voodoo magic and Candyman's soul is emprisoned in a mirror. The gory chase is then to find this mirror and to destroy it in order to alleviate the spell, the curse. The rest is nothing but details and the details are what the film is all about. But, in spite of that, the myth will go on and survive, especially because the heroin will give birth to a daughter who she will name Carolyne. A myth, no matter how you destroy it, always survive in the memory of the people who carry it in their minds. The white culture of the US is totally inhabited with the black culture of the slaves the whites so often and with so much pleasure killed in agony and suffering.

But I had no idea who Candyman was until I rented a DVD called ""Bogey Men"" and it had a Candyman on there top horror movie icons of all time.Well, when I watched the first Candyman, I did not like it. I was hoping to uncover a great horror saga to explore, but I was let down. I really can't see the reason why people think that movie is the best of the Candman series.I had no interest in watching this sequel, but I'm glad I did rent it, now. Unlike the first Candyman, I hit play expecting a movie that would let me down... but I really got into this one the more it got into the story. It started off with cheap scares that I rolled my eyes at; you know those loud noises they blast through the speakers when something flashes onto the screen after a moment of silence. That does not scare me, and I consider that a cheap way to try and make a horror film. I cant say anything about this film was scary, but I don't scare easily.. Not from movies, but I really liked the storyline and plot of this one.The story the movie tells is of The Candymans origin, and what happened when he died, and why. And who his decedents are. The concept they use for how to destroy the Candyman in this one is a good idea, I think. But the very end was a bit lousy and rushed; I think they could have improved upon the end scene with Candyman.I'd recommend you rent the movie before you decide on anything, I'm willing to bet there are people who are complete opposites of the way I feel, and they say this one sucked and the first one was heaps better. But I'm the other way around with this one.It has some cool gore shots slipped in, some cool death scenes, even for 1995 some of the CGI shots looked decent, tho some looked pretty shiddy. Overall, I liked this movie. It's no classic masterpiece, nor would I say it's one of my fav. slasher films, but I did enjoy it, and would recommend it if you have nothing better to do then sit down and watch a slasher who appears when you say his named 5 times in the mirror.",4,"Beetleguise, Beetleguise, Beetleguise",1112832000,"04 7, 2005",2005,2107,"['had', 'heard', 'brief', 'mention', 'Candyman', 'listening', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Final', 'Destination', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'Candyman', 'was', 'rented', 'DVD', 'called', 'Bogey', 'Men', 'had', 'Candyman', 'top', 'horror', 'movie', 'icons', 'time.Well', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'Candyman', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'hoping', 'uncover', 'great', 'horror', 'saga', 'explore', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'think', 'movie', 'best', 'Candman', 'series.I', 'had', 'interest', 'watching', 'sequel', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'rent', 'now', 'first', 'Candyman', 'hit', 'play', 'expecting', 'movie', 'would', 'let', 'down', 'really', 'got', 'one', 'more', 'got', 'story', 'started', 'off', 'cheap', 'scares', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'know', 'loud', 'noises', 'blast', 'speakers', 'when', 'something', 'flashes', 'screen', 'moment', 'silence', 'not', 'scare', 'consider', 'cheap', 'way', 'try', 'make', 'horror', 'film', 'cant', 'say', 'anything', 'film', 'was', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'scare', 'easily..', 'Not', 'movies', 'really', 'liked', 'storyline', 'plot', 'one.The', 'story', 'movie', 'Candymans', 'origin', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'died', 'why', 'who', 'decedents', 'are', 'concept', 'use', 'how', 'destroy', 'Candyman', 'one', 'good', 'idea', 'think', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'bit', 'lousy', 'rushed', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'end', 'scene', 'Candyman.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'rent', 'movie', 'decide', 'anything', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'complete', 'opposites', 'way', 'feel', 'say', 'one', 'sucked', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'heaps', 'better', ""'m"", 'other', 'way', 'one.It', 'cool', 'gore', 'shots', 'slipped', 'cool', 'death', 'scenes', 'even', '1995', 'CGI', 'shots', 'looked', 'decent', 'tho', 'looked', 'pretty', 'shiddy', 'Overall', 'liked', 'movie', 'classic', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'fav', 'films', 'did', 'enjoy', 'would', 'recommend', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'then', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'slasher', 'who', 'when', 'say', 'named', '5', 'times', 'mirror']",N/A

155750,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,079284629X,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 3]","Director:  Bill CondonCast:  Tony Todd, Kelly Rowan, William O'Leary, Bill Nunn, Matt Clark, David Gianopoulos, Fay Hauser, Joshua Gibran Mayweather, Timothy Carhart, Veronica Cartwright.Running Time:  93 minutesRated R for violence and gore, and for some sexuality and language.Many die-hard horror fans absolutely worship the original ""Candyman"" because it's so genuinely scary and intelligently adapted from a Clive Barker story. This sequel (it looks more like a prequel, actually, with all those flashbacks) is not entirely unwatchable, it just immensely pales in comparison to the original, like so many other redundant sequels do. It seems though director Bill Condon and his army of crew members totally missed the point of Barker's tale and of the original film.  What began as a tale of enigmatic mystery and mystique, brooding with paranoia is now been cut down to another run-of-the-mill hacker series that takes away from the brilliance of the 1992 original.It's Mardi Gras season in New Orleans, where inner-city school teacher Annie Tarrant (Kelly Rowan) proves to her class that there is no Candyman by looking into a mirror and saying his name five times. She should have listened to them because of course there is a Candyman and her brother Ethan (William O'Leary) knows it, as he's been arrested for the murder of the smug fat bloke from the first film, but of course he's innocent and the real culprit is the hook-handed killer, back to wreak more havoc in the lives of Annie's family. Believing that Ethan and her mother (Veronica Cartwright) aren't telling her the whole truth about his arrest and her father's death, Annie delves into the legend herself.""Farewell to the Flesh"" departs from the original with Annie's deep, dark family secret, which is not only completely predictable but also totally uninteresting. The supposed twists only start coming after way too much draggy set-up where the movie tries to create mystery about the existence of the Candyman even though we all know he's real and we all know what's going to happen from this point on. The menace of the character has gone, his appearances are too numerous and aren't scary, and the moments when he pops up to stick his hook through someone's back are completely expected. Basically this does nothing that the original didn't do better, with the poor black area of town, the missing kid, the cops believing Ethan carried out the Candyman's crimes and the Candyman's spell over Annie all being derivative of the first movie. The Mardi Gras setting adds some colour but has nothing to do with the story and gives us the irrelevant, at times nonsensical radio show that weaves through the movie. The change of location also weakens the Candyman mythos, because an urban legend in one part of a town I can believe, but now apparently everyone in the civilised world has heard of, and lives in fear of, the Candyman. The film tries too hard to turn him into a horror icon along the lines of Freddy or Michael Myers, and it succeeds only too well, because this time around the impact has gone, too much detail is revealed about his origin and the story is a pale imitation of what's already been done before.",2,Candyman:  The Farewell to the Flesh  (1995),1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,3196,"['Director', 'Bill', 'CondonCast', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', 'William', ""O'Leary"", 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'Matt', 'Clark', 'David', 'Gianopoulos', 'Fay', 'Hauser', 'Joshua', 'Gibran', 'Mayweather', 'Timothy', 'Carhart', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright.Running', 'Time', '93', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'violence', 'gore', 'sexuality', 'language.Many', 'die-hard', 'horror', 'fans', 'absolutely', 'worship', 'original', 'Candyman', 'so', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'intelligently', 'adapted', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'story', 'sequel', 'more', 'prequel', 'actually', 'flashbacks', 'not', 'entirely', 'unwatchable', 'just', 'immensely', 'pales', 'comparison', 'original', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'redundant', 'sequels', 'do', 'director', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'army', 'crew', 'members', 'totally', 'missed', 'point', 'Barker', 'tale', 'original', 'film', 'What', 'began', 'tale', 'enigmatic', 'mystery', 'mystique', 'brooding', 'paranoia', 'now', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'run-of-the-mill', 'hacker', 'series', 'away', 'brilliance', '1992', 'original.It', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'season', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'inner-city', 'school', 'teacher', 'Annie', 'Tarrant', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', 'class', 'Candyman', 'looking', 'mirror', 'saying', 'name', 'five', 'times', 'should', 'have', 'listened', 'course', 'Candyman', 'brother', 'Ethan', 'William', ""O'Leary"", 'been', 'arrested', 'murder', 'smug', 'fat', 'bloke', 'first', 'film', 'course', 'innocent', 'real', 'culprit', 'hook-handed', 'killer', 'back', 'wreak', 'more', 'havoc', 'lives', 'Annie', 'family', 'Believing', 'Ethan', 'mother', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'are', ""n't"", 'telling', 'whole', 'truth', 'arrest', 'father', 'death', 'Annie', 'legend', 'Farewell', 'Flesh', 'original', 'Annie', 'deep', 'dark', 'family', 'secret', 'not', 'only', 'completely', 'predictable', 'also', 'totally', 'uninteresting', 'supposed', 'twists', 'only', 'start', 'coming', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'set-up', 'where', 'movie', 'create', 'mystery', 'existence', 'Candyman', 'even', 'know', 'real', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'point', 'menace', 'character', 'gone', 'appearances', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', 'moments', 'when', 'up', 'stick', 'hook', 'someone', 'back', 'are', 'completely', 'expected', 'Basically', 'nothing', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'poor', 'black', 'area', 'town', 'missing', 'kid', 'cops', 'believing', 'Ethan', 'carried', 'out', 'Candyman', 'crimes', 'Candyman', 'spell', 'Annie', 'being', 'derivative', 'first', 'movie', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'setting', 'colour', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'irrelevant', 'times', 'nonsensical', 'radio', 'show', 'movie', 'change', 'location', 'also', 'Candyman', 'mythos', 'urban', 'legend', 'one', 'part', 'town', 'can', 'believe', 'now', 'apparently', 'everyone', 'civilised', 'world', 'heard', 'fear', 'Candyman', 'film', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'turn', 'horror', 'icon', 'lines', 'Freddy', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'time', 'impact', 'gone', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'revealed', 'origin', 'story', 'pale', 'imitation', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'before']",N/A
