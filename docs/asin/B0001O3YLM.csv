After a couple years of friends telling me what a great show it was I finally took the plunge and decided to check it out.  I half to say I don't know what all the hype was about.  Yeah, it can be a fun, sexy show but some of the plots are boring and rather redundant -- even in the first season.  Granted, I can see why Julian McMahon became the breakout star of the show -- he's very good and has developed a wonderful character you love to hate.  Dylan Walsh and Joley Richardson's charcters, on the other hand, were very obnoxious.  In the end, I just din't see the point.  I'm not giving up, however.

812263,A13NM1PES9OXVN,B0001O3YLM,"Angela Mitchell ""Angela Mitchell""","[0, 0]","There's a key scene in the pilot episode of ""Nip/Tuck"" in which a vain, gorgeous blonde model asks (the equally vain and gorgeous) Dr. Troy what he thinks she needs surgery-wise to be a ""10.""So Troy pulls out a marker and proceeds to bluntly detail every one of her flaws from head to foot on her naked body -- what he would lift, or change, remove, or cut. He then turns her marked-up self toward the mirror to confront what she had thought was so perfect only moments before. It's a shattering scene.Which is why ""Nip/Tuck"" is so good.  The show is a wonderful paradox because it's all about facades -- while presenting a gorgeous facade itself. But there's always something else beneath the surface.  It's everything a cable drama should be -- and everything network TV these days pretty much can't be.  It's brutal (the surgeries are not for the weak of stomach and are often startlingly real), witty (the dialogue is quick, biting, and bracing), complex, and sexy as anything to boot.The show (especially on DVD) looks fantastic, with beautiful production values, great music, film-quality cinematography, and superb acting.  It's slick and glossy and shiny and gorgeous -- and then it promptly looks underneath at all the insecurity and ugliness.  All these people want perfection, but let's face it, how often do we get it?The two doctors are the backbone of the show, and the actors who bring them to life are incredible.  Dylan Walsh is wonderful -- I'd never been a fan of his before, but his boy-scout boyishness is used perfectly in this, and his acting chops blew me away. The guy can act.And Julian McMahon is a revelation as Troy -- it's the role of a lifetime, and McMahon seems to visibly revel in his character's scheming, conniving, smugness, and superficiality -- he's almost a sociopath, and McMahon brings something almost reptilian and flat to his eyes in some scenes.  And then just when you least expect it, he'll give you a glimpse of something almost heroic underneath. The guy is simply not easily defined, as conflicted and dangerous as he is beautiful.The women of the show are just as good, especially Joely Richardson, who is fantastic and almost Shakespearan as Walsh's bitter, conflicted wife.  I love Roma Downey as the smart and streetwise nurse of the practice, as well as Julie Warner, who is very good in a lovely and key role as a cancer survivor.The entire first season of ""Nip/Tuck"" is excellent and worth seeing, and while there are several enjoyable standalone episodes, the season-long arc of this show is particularly strong, with every character facing, defeating, or falling before some kind of inner demon before the end.WARNING: The show is definitely adult, and potentially shocking for many.  The surgeries are often graphically depicted, as are many sexual scenarios (most involving a naked or semi-naked McMahon, not that I'm complaining, LOL).While made for F/X, the show is really best viewed along the same lines as an HBO or Showtime show -- the levels of violence and nudity are pretty similar. (But in the show's defense, it's very creative about this stuff, and everything often has a deeper meaning -- the sex is hysterically funny, or revealing, or poignant, depending on the episode.)So if you're open to something exhilarating and new -- a medical drama unlike anything else out there -- ""Nip/Tuck"" is rewarding and truly a don't-miss. Especially with so much mediocrity on TV right now.(Note: I removed one star because for some inexplicable reason this DVD set doesn't boast a single commentary -- unthinkable for a show as deep and multifaceted as this one. I hope they correct this in Season 2 -- a real shame.)",4,"Cuts Beneath the Surface -- a shocking, smart, sexy show",1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,3680,"['key', 'scene', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Nip/Tuck', 'vain', 'gorgeous', 'blonde', 'model', 'asks', 'equally', 'vain', 'gorgeous', 'Dr', 'Troy', 'what', 'surgery-wise', 'be', '10', 'So', 'Troy', 'out', 'marker', 'proceeds', 'bluntly', 'detail', 'one', 'flaws', 'head', 'foot', 'naked', 'body', 'what', 'would', 'lift', 'change', 'remove', 'cut', 'then', 'marked-up', 'self', 'mirror', 'confront', 'what', 'had', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'perfect', 'only', 'moments', 'shattering', 'scene.Which', 'why', 'Nip/Tuck', 'so', 'good', 'show', 'wonderful', 'paradox', 'facades', 'presenting', 'gorgeous', 'facade', 'always', 'something', 'else', 'surface', 'everything', 'cable', 'drama', 'should', 'be', 'everything', 'network', 'TV', 'days', 'pretty', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'brutal', 'surgeries', 'are', 'not', 'weak', 'stomach', 'are', 'often', 'startlingly', 'real', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'quick', 'biting', 'bracing', 'complex', 'sexy', 'anything', 'boot.The', 'show', 'especially', 'DVD', 'fantastic', 'beautiful', 'production', 'values', 'great', 'music', 'film-quality', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'acting', 'slick', 'glossy', 'shiny', 'gorgeous', 'then', 'promptly', 'underneath', 'insecurity', 'ugliness', 'people', 'want', 'perfection', 'let', 'face', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'get', 'two', 'doctors', 'are', 'backbone', 'show', 'actors', 'who', 'bring', 'life', 'are', 'incredible', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'wonderful', ""'d"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'before', 'boy-scout', 'boyishness', 'used', 'perfectly', 'acting', 'chops', 'away', 'guy', 'can', 'act.And', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'revelation', 'Troy', 'role', 'lifetime', 'McMahon', 'visibly', 'revel', 'character', 'scheming', 'conniving', 'smugness', 'superficiality', 'almost', 'sociopath', 'McMahon', 'something', 'almost', 'reptilian', 'flat', 'eyes', 'scenes', 'then', 'just', 'when', 'least', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'give', 'glimpse', 'something', 'almost', 'heroic', 'underneath', 'guy', 'simply', 'not', 'easily', 'defined', 'conflicted', 'dangerous', 'beautiful.The', 'women', 'show', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'especially', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'who', 'fantastic', 'almost', 'Shakespearan', 'Walsh', 'bitter', 'conflicted', 'wife', 'love', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'smart', 'streetwise', 'nurse', 'practice', 'as', 'well', 'Julie', 'Warner', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'lovely', 'key', 'role', 'cancer', 'survivor.The', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'Nip/Tuck', 'excellent', 'worth', 'seeing', 'are', 'several', 'enjoyable', 'standalone', 'episodes', 'season-long', 'arc', 'show', 'particularly', 'strong', 'character', 'facing', 'defeating', 'falling', 'kind', 'inner', 'demon', 'end.WARNING', 'show', 'definitely', 'adult', 'potentially', 'shocking', 'many', 'surgeries', 'are', 'often', 'graphically', 'depicted', 'are', 'many', 'sexual', 'scenarios', 'most', 'involving', 'naked', 'semi-naked', 'McMahon', 'not', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'LOL', '.While', 'made', 'F/X', 'show', 'really', 'best', 'viewed', 'same', 'lines', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'show', 'levels', 'violence', 'nudity', 'are', 'pretty', 'similar', 'show', 'defense', 'very', 'creative', 'stuff', 'everything', 'often', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'sex', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'revealing', 'poignant', 'depending', 'episode', 'So', ""'re"", 'open', 'something', 'exhilarating', 'new', 'medical', 'drama', 'anything', 'else', 'there', 'Nip/Tuck', 'rewarding', 'truly', ""don't-miss"", 'Especially', 'so', 'much', 'mediocrity', 'TV', 'right', 'now', 'Note', 'removed', 'one', 'star', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'DVD', 'set', ""n't"", 'boast', 'single', 'commentary', 'unthinkable', 'show', 'deep', 'multifaceted', 'one', 'hope', 'correct', 'Season', '2', 'real', 'shame']",Nip/Tuck: Season 1

812265,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,B0001O3YLM,Armando M. Mesa,"[2, 4]","Nip/Tuck certainly fits the bill for the title of adult cutting edge cable t.v. programming/entertainment or pushing the envelope status (I have been hooked since episode 1)...I don't need to go into all the descriptive details as to what I'm referring to as other reviewers or viewers have stated and witnessed just how provocative this series is ! A play by play run down of each episode is not necessary. Just a series about two top plastic surgeons running a clinic together (best friends since college) and their adventures with business, pleasure and personal matters.  It's titillating, thought provoking, and definitely mind blowing at times.It's steamy, not just in it's writing and display of eye opening sexual situations , but the dramatic issues of career, family and life these characters face. No matter how bizarre these situations get on the show, there is plenty of razor -sharp repartee (no pun) intermixed with caustic dialogue (sometimes the caustic is quite comical---other times, it's just sarcasm). Plenty of incredible and riveting performances by it's actors. The plot always thickens and twists and turns with each episode !Just when you think it's central characters couldn't get into worse predicaments, BANG !Dr. Shaun McNamara is the more sensitive and down to earth devoted family man with the pleasant and likeable disposition and comforting bedside manner. Dr. Christian Troy is the hedonistic, arrogant, and sexually compulsive swinging bachelor who goes through one night stands and fast cars as he does surgical gloves (use 'em and lose 'em).Yet, as diverse as these two characters' personas are their friendship and their chemistry work. What is amazing as this series has progressed is how Shaun and Christian sometimes are not that different in certain aspects (last year's season found the married/family man Dr. McNamara having an affair with a dying woman). Then, in a recent episode of the second season Dr. Troy wanted to raise a child he once believed was his biological baby (until the actual birth proves otherwise that he is not the father)... Very gripping and emotional moments for both characters !Sometimes I catch myself doing a double take on how Dr. Christian Troy speaks of women in general and their anatomy, or his anatomy...If this is offensive to some viewers I can understand why they would switch channels. BUT, you have to admit, because of the excellent writing and the wanting to know what's -gonna- happen -next factor, one becomes glued to the set! Nip/Tuck has that incredible WOW ! factor that is rare to find in tv/cable programming these days for an after prime time drama series. However, it is not all drama.It has it's share of bizarre comical moments. Also, each patient case the doctors deal with are not all laced with psychological or insecurity/vanity problems. Some of the situations deal with people who really need reconstructive surgery due to illness,accident,violence, or other disastrous disfiguring mishaps.The surgeries themselves prove that the Nip/Tuck special effects department and personnel have really done their homework and job to create or re-create some startling and realistic surgical scenes not for the squeamish viewer.This is absolutely not for young viewers.

812266,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0001O3YLM,Benjamin,"[0, 6]","""Nip/Tuck,"" which I've become addicted to since I bought these DVDs, is a knock-down-drag-out great and twisted show. It's very well-acted and completely compelling, featuring soap opera style twists that you won't see coming at all and beautiful people made that way through bizarre and disgusting plastic surgery scenes.McNamara/Troy is an extremely successful plastic surgery partnership in Miami, thanks to the combination of talented surgeon Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and the hot and charming Christian Troy (Julian McMahon), who have been friends since medical school. The initial conflicts in the show come from Sean's midlife crisis, which allows him both to sleepwalk through his troubled marriage to manic Julia (Joely Richardson) and leads him to think that his work is unimportant. Christian, in the meantime, continues to seduce women without care while harboring some deeply-rooted personal demons.One particularly corrupt surgery that ends REALLY badly for both the patient and the doctors, though, changes the whole set-up. Suddenly, McNamara/Troy is in all sorts of trouble with the Mafia and the police, and they've got a new psychiatric consult, Grace Santiago (Valerie Cruz), on duty to help them better screen their patients before they go under the knife.That, of course, leads to more drama, and the McNamaras' troubled son Matt and Julia's trip back to med school adds even more.The show is occasionally, based upon its subject matter, morally vague, dirty, dark and villainous. It's also so delicious to watch that it never ceases, throughout its first season, to be anything short of fascinating. Sometimes you can't believe that you love these characters, in spite of some of the horrible things they're capable of doing to each other and to anyone in their path, but the top-notch acting of ""Nip/Tuck"" leads you to care for them, no matter what they've done.Since buying these DVDs, I've been watching the second season on FX almost religiously.

812267,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B0001O3YLM,Ben Rowland,"[0, 1]","Being a big fan of other dramatic series such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""Six Feet Under"", I was very intrigued by the premise of ""Nip/Tuck"". While not as brilliant as either series, it succeeds as an offbeat and quirky saga, and I found my time spent with this DVD set to be very satisfying indeed.The earmark of a good series is when you start watching it, and then find that you cannot stop. ""Nip/Tuck"" is compelling for the right reasons. It presents characters that I care about, and it gives me a storyline that makes me care what happens next. The series follows the lives of two middle-aged, WASPY plastic surgeons and their adventures through surgery and their individual mid-life crises. The two surgeons are also polar opposites. Dylan Walsh plays Sean McNamara, a family man who wants to help people and genuinely make a difference through his work. His partner, Christian Troy (Julian McMahon), is the playboy who is more interested in sex and money than what his partner strives for. Their difference becomes a primer for the dramatic tension that brings the series to life, and the home lives of each character makes it even more rich a character drama. Similar to ""Six Feet Under"", each episode begins with a new character's own story. Instead of a death, it is a person looking to have plastic surgery done. This becomes the catalyst for what occurs throughout the episode, and it gives each episode a movie-like quality.The show has excellent acting and writing, that goes without saying. The flaws will depend on the viewer's expectations. The surgery scenes add a grittiness that makes the show work, but it will definitely turn off the more squeamish viewers. They are extremely graphic, as are some of the events that occur to the surgeons (and other characters) throughout the first season. The only problem I found with the story was the over-reliance on soap opera cliches, such as ""it's your baby"", ""I had an affair"", and ""It's my right to die"". These do wear thin, but it doesn't make the series any less enjoyable.I highly recommend this series to those who enjoy the offbeat and sometimes irreverent quirks of the HBO drama series. I have only seen the first season, so I cannot comment on the series as a whole, but this first season is one heck of a kick-off.",4,A disturbingly perfect drama.,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,2285,"['Being', 'big', 'fan', 'other', 'dramatic', 'series', 'such', 'Sopranos', 'Six', 'Feet', 'was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'Nip/Tuck', 'not', 'as', 'brilliant', 'series', 'offbeat', 'quirky', 'saga', 'found', 'time', 'spent', 'DVD', 'set', 'be', 'very', 'satisfying', 'indeed.The', 'earmark', 'good', 'series', 'when', 'start', 'watching', 'then', 'find', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'Nip/Tuck', 'compelling', 'right', 'reasons', 'characters', 'care', 'storyline', 'care', 'what', 'next', 'series', 'lives', 'two', 'middle-aged', 'WASPY', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'adventures', 'surgery', 'individual', 'mid-life', 'crises', 'two', 'surgeons', 'are', 'also', 'polar', 'opposites', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Sean', 'McNamara', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'help', 'people', 'genuinely', 'make', 'difference', 'work', 'partner', 'Christian', 'Troy', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'playboy', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'sex', 'money', 'what', 'partner', 'strives', 'difference', 'primer', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'series', 'life', 'home', 'lives', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'rich', 'character', 'drama', 'Similar', 'Six', 'Feet', 'episode', 'new', 'character', 'own', 'story', 'Instead', 'death', 'person', 'looking', 'have', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'done', 'catalyst', 'what', 'episode', 'episode', 'movie-like', 'quality.The', 'show', 'excellent', 'acting', 'writing', 'saying', 'flaws', 'will', 'depend', 'viewer', 'expectations', 'surgery', 'add', 'grittiness', 'show', 'work', 'will', 'definitely', 'turn', 'off', 'more', 'squeamish', 'viewers', 'are', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'are', 'events', 'occur', 'surgeons', 'other', 'characters', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'problem', 'found', 'story', 'was', 'over-reliance', 'soap', 'opera', 'cliches', 'such', 'baby', 'had', 'affair', 'right', 'die', 'do', 'wear', 'thin', ""n't"", 'make', 'series', 'less', 'enjoyable.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'who', 'enjoy', 'offbeat', 'sometimes', 'irreverent', 'quirks', 'HBO', 'drama', 'series', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'series', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'heck', 'kick-off']",Nip/Tuck: Season 1

The acting is incredible, the plot keeps twisting, and each of the charaters are so complex. I love that sometimes the characters are wise and sometimes they're misguided; no one is just a sinner or a saint. The issues the show deals with: body image, self hatred, aging, honesty and trust, are so compelling that I stayed up until 2:30am watching the DVDs!

Unfortunately for network TV, this type of programming is near to non-existent. Enter---FX, the savior of TV as far as I'm concerned.I'de watched Nip/Tuck ads for almost a year a half and never really paid attention until a couple of weeks ago. After the season finale of 'Rescue Me'(another phenomenal show), I suddenly had nothing to fill the void. So, I decided to check out the show that filled that now vacant time spot. I watched my first episode of Nip/Tuck--- and the rest is history.Season 1 is a truly beautiful demonstration of well written stories, intriguing characters, unexpected twists, and all in all---great drama.

812270,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B0001O3YLM,Busy Body,"[18, 20]","A lot of ground-breaking, long-running programmes have finished in the past two years, and they all seem to be my favourites! Buffy is gone, as is Sex And The City, and of course, who could forget Friends? I thought I'd have nothing to watch on TV anymore, Will & Grace being my only saviour, but then along came Nip/Tuck in August 2004. Originally broadcast on cable in the UK, the show was sold to Channel 4 and advertised as the next big thing. With commercials for this hip, sexy and stylish new drama every half an hour, there can't be one single person who watches Channel 4 who doesn't know about it. The ratings show this: Nip/Tuck has gone on to become a massive ratings hit in the past two months that it has been on air, and I for one am completely sold.Let me first say that Nip/Tuck is definitely not a show for everyone. It contains many scenes of medical gore and explicit sex scenes, along with strong language and distressing moments of human revelation. I'm not deterred by these factors, but sometimes I have to look away during the medical scenes. Basically, the show revolves around the two lead characters, Dr. Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) and Dr. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) who own a blossoming plastic surgeon practice in Miami South Beach. They are lifetime friends, but are rather different in character - Dr. Troy is a single, middle-aged, sex-maniac who is commitment-phobic. This is partly due to childhood experiences, yet one cannot feel total sympathy for his manipulative and devious ways. He is very sexy and woman can't resist him. Dr. McNamara is the sensible family-man, happily married to Julia (Joely Richardson) and the adoring father of two children, Matt (John Hensley) being the son.The two doctors are both each going through a full-blown mid-life crises, involving their families, patients and each other. Season 1 perfectly captures this. What makes the show so unique for me is the successful blend of humour and drama. They are at times funny, and at times disturbingly powerful in their drama. The storylines are cutting-edge and very sharp to the times. The perception of society in this show is acute and precisely executed: it shows society for what it is, and presents the dangers of the need for perfection, without shoving it down the viewer's throat. The storylines are cutting-edge because a show like this has never been around - it is only the advances in modern technology and the ever-growing popularity of plastic surgery that a show like this has been made possible. Therefore a whole world of new storylines has been opened for exploration, and when you attach this with good old-fashioned human emotion, you get a fantastic blend of ground-breaking new territory to explore.The show's main stars give the best performances. Julian McMahon and Dylan Walsh are the backbone if the entire show, but for me it is the superb Joely Richardson who steals the show. Her emotional-intensity is on fire, the woman can REALLY act! Valerie Cruz stars as Grace Santiago, the sickenly-gorgeous psychologist who must analyse the mental-state of patients before they undergo surgery. Roma Maffia stars as the loveable lesbian Liz Cruz, who is the two surgeon's anaesthesiologist. The storylines involving all these characters are incredibly complex, but all the threads of their characters are tied-up towards the end of the season. Sort of.There are so many characters in the first season that make this show so appealing, but the particular stand-outs include the desperate model-to-be Kimberly who will do anything to achieve her goal of perfection and acceptance. Her revenge on Christian is brilliant. The short but memorable role of overweight Nanette Babcock are heart-breaking in their honesty, whilst the young transsexual Sofia Lopez opens up her whole world to the viewer and how difficult it is just being accepted as she is. Most people come to the two doctors for petty things such as boob enhancements, and when contrasted with the emotional need to feel content as a transsexual, the reality of life is put into perspective. Megan O'Hara is a patient that Dr. McNamara becomes most emotionally-attached to, and even goes as far as to have an affair with, risking his entire family. This might seem devious, but their relationship is beautiful: she's a cancer-patient in need of love and affection and has only a short time left to live. Her suicide scene is heart-breaking. I was completely transfixed.The high-emotion continues with Cara Fitzgerald, who is knocked down by Matt McNamara and a friend in a car. Her strong-Christian mother refuses plastic surgery to reshape her unrecognisable daughter's face, but eventually has to give in. The multiple-personality of Montana/Sassy/Justicy is another highlight for its emotional intensity and brave tackling of such a sensitive topic. The last two episodes are dominated by the evil Escobar Gallardo who made his presence in the first episode, but returns to use the doctor's darkest secrets as blackmail, forcing them to remove the liquid-heroin implants of Escobar's curvaceous drug-couriers.There are too many brilliant scenes to talk of in just one review of Nip/Tuck Season 1, but trust me when I say that this show really is one of the best to come along in recent years. The only concern is that sometimes the dialogue is a little cheesy or inappropriate for the scene's level of intensity, but this is just a minor quibble from such a promising and popular show. I look very much forward to seeing Season 2 of thie show, which will be broadcast sometime next year. While I wait, I'm sure my box set of Season 1 will console me with repeat viewings of this disturbingly perfect drama.",5,A Disturbingly Perfect Drama,1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,5711,"['lot',

Unfortunately for me, I don't have cable.  However, when this DVD set came out I was lucky enough to find it for rent at a local video store and thus I rented and watched all five discs.  I'm glad I did!  This is a great series that shouldn't be missed.The plot centers on Dr. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and his partner in crime Dr. Christian Troy (Julian McMahon).  They are both plastic surgeons who share their medical practice.  Together they help people to hide on the outside what they can't face on the inside.  Sean McNamara has a wife (Joely Richardson) and two children, and seems to be relatively content with his life.  That is, if you ignore the fact that he doesn't talk to his wife and kids as much as he should because of his work hours.  Furthermore, his wife feels resentment towards him because she raised the kids alone and helped support him through medical school while ignoring her own dreams.  Christian Troy is the antithesis of Sean in many ways.  He is a commitment-phobic sex addict who tries to get out and enjoy what life has to offer.  The fact that he makes a ton of money and can wave that notion in women's faces certainly aids him in his quest.  Undoubtedly, he has made several enemies along the way.The relationship between these two is complex.  They are more than mere business partners.  They are best friends and confidants, and together they get themselves mixed up in strange medley of unsettling incidences that will test their friendship and ultimately bring them closer than ever before.  Throughout the course of this first season, they will be unwillingly involved in trafficking drugs across the border, disguising child molesters, and even getting rid of a dead body.  In addition to the roller coaster ride of events they experience together, they each have their own separate personal ordeals that must be dealt with.  Dr. McNamara's crumbling marriage is a constant reminder of his failures, and Dr. Troy's risqu&eacute; love life will come back to haunt him.The ultimate theme for the series is that no matter how beautiful we look on the outside, there can still be hideousness on the inside.  We are a society of grit and grime, and no amount of money and technology will change that.  Nip/Tuck portrays that harsh reality in a brutal, in-your-face manner that is both intriguing and addicting.  The symbolism seen in the opening of each episode is a great way to emphasize this point.I must admit that I wasn't all that interested in this series after the first couple of episodes.  They seemed to plunge the viewer right into the plot without spending much time developing the characters.  I wanted to know who these people were and why they would do some of the things they were doing.  However, I'm glad I stuck with it and continued to watch.  With each new episode, small tidbits of each character's personality are revealed.  These are complex characters that can't be explained in a few episodes.  The writing for each episode is phenomenal, with each one being better than its predecessor.I definitely suggest this series to fans of good television.  I should note that the plastic surgery scenes tend to be quite graphic and are definitely not suitable for everyone, but don't let that keep you from checking this out.  I can't wait for the second season to come out on DVD!",5,"""A Perfect Life""",1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,3430,"['When', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'series', 'friends', 'simply', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'However', 'when', 'DVD', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'find', 'rent', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'thus', 'rented', 'watched', 'five', 'discs', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'great', 'series', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Dr.', 'Sean', 'McNamara', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'partner', 'crime', 'Dr.', 'Christian', 'Troy', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'are', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'who', 'share', 'medical', 'practice', 'Together', 'help', 'people', 'hide', 'outside', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'face', 'inside', 'Sean', 'McNamara', 'wife', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'two', 'children', 'be', 'relatively', 'content', 'life', 'ignore', 'fact', ""n't"", 'talk', 'wife', 'kids', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'work', 'hours', 'Furthermore', 'wife', 'feels', 'resentment', 'towards', 'raised', 'kids', 'alone', 'helped', 'support', 'medical', 'school', 'ignoring', 'own', 'dreams', 'Christian', 'Troy', 'antithesis', 'Sean', 'many', 'ways', 'commitment-phobic', 'sex', 'addict', 'who', 'get', 'out', 'enjoy', 'what', 'life', 'offer', 'fact', 'ton', 'money', 'can', 'wave', 'notion', 'women', 'certainly', 'aids', 'quest', 'Undoubtedly', 'made', 'several', 'enemies', 'way.The', 'relationship', 'two', 'complex', 'are', 'more', 'mere', 'business', 'partners', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'confidants', 'together', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'strange', 'medley', 'unsettling', 'incidences', 'will', 'test', 'friendship', 'ultimately', 'bring', 'closer', 'ever', 'course', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'unwillingly', 'involved', 'trafficking', 'drugs', 'border', 'disguising', 'child', 'molesters', 'even', 'getting', 'rid', 'dead', 'body', 'addition', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'events', 'experience', 'together', 'have', 'own', 'separate', 'personal', 'ordeals', 'must', 'be', 'dealt', 'Dr.', 'McNamara', 'crumbling', 'marriage', 'constant', 'reminder', 'failures', 'Dr', 'Troy', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'life', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'him.The', 'ultimate', 'theme', 'series', 'matter', 'how', 'beautiful', 'look', 'outside', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'hideousness', 'inside', 'are', 'society', 'grit', 'grime', 'amount', 'money', 'technology', 'will', 'change', 'Nip/Tuck', 'harsh', 'reality', 'brutal', 'in-your-face', 'manner', 'intriguing', 'addicting', 'symbolism', 'seen', 'opening', 'episode', 'great', 'way', 'emphasize', 'point.I', 'must', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'series', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'plunge', 'viewer', 'right', 'plot', 'spending', 'much', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', 'wanted', 'know', 'who', 'people', 'were', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'things', 'were', 'doing', 'However', ""'m"", 'glad', 'stuck', 'continued', 'watch', 'new', 'episode', 'small', 'tidbits', 'character', 'personality', 'are', 'revealed', 'are', 'complex', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'few', 'episodes', 'writing', 'episode', 'phenomenal', 'one', 'being', 'better', 'predecessor.I', 'definitely', 'suggest', 'series', 'fans', 'good', 'television', 'should', 'note', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'scenes', 'tend', 'be', 'quite', 'graphic', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'suitable', 'everyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'checking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'DVD']",Nip/Tuck: Season 1

Sure it has a lot of sex, good looking women, mature audiences kind of stuff....but, it also has an underlying message. Plastic surgery is not for everyone. At times, it can do more harm than good. And is even the concept of plastic surgery hurting our perceptions of what women are supposed to look like, and so on. Some people need it for real reasons like they got in a accident or something that was out of their control. Others just abuse it because they are rich and don't want to look older. You get a little bit of both in Nip/Tuck.The story centers around two main characters, Shawn McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Christian Troy (Julian McMahon). They are plastic surgeons in Miami, FL. Shawn is the married family guy. While Christian has a different woman every night and sleeps around like crazy, Shawn is married to his wife Julia (Joley Richardson). They have one teenage son (John Hensley) and one daughter. It's actually hard to write a review about this show, because I don't want to give away any plot lines or anything. It's one of those shows that once you start watching it, you have to see what happens next week. I can't say that about a lot of TV shows these days, since reality TV is running rampant.My best advice would be to check out the show on FX (the channel), see if you like it and then pick up season one on DVD. If you are anything like me and enjoy one-hour dramas, you will be done with the DVD set in maybe one day. It's that good.Special Features: There are 3 documentaries and I liked all of them. There is a gag reel, which is actually quite funny. There is one deleted scene, a music video for the song ""A Perfect Lie"", and a teaser trailer. These are not bad supplements considering most DVD sets of TV shows don't give you squat.",5,A surprising must-watch show.........,1099180800,"10 31, 2004",2004,2335,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'commercials', 'Nip/Tuck', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'Sure', 'looked', 'cool', 'women', 'looked', 'had', 'edge', 'did', ""n't"", 'thrill', 'much', 'Then', 'ended', 'up', 'catching', 'season', 'finale', 'season', 'one', 'TV', 'friends', 'were', 'huge', 'fans', 'show', 'saw', 'season', 'premiere', 'season', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'hooked', 'ever', 'would', 'religiously', 'watch', 'season', 'two', 'Tuesday', 'night', 'have', 'recently', 'purchased', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'am', 'quite', 'happy', 'did.Nip/Tuck', 'very', 'interesting', 'show', 'Sure', 'lot', 'sex', 'good', 'looking', 'women', 'mature', 'audiences', 'kind', 'stuff', '.but', 'also', 'underlying', 'message', 'Plastic', 'surgery', 'not', 'everyone', 'times', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'even', 'concept', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'hurting', 'perceptions', 'what', 'women', 'are', 'supposed', 'look', 'so', 'people', 'need', 'real', 'reasons', 'got', 'accident', 'something', 'was', 'control', 'Others', 'just', 'abuse', 'are', 'rich', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'look', 'older', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'Nip/Tuck.The', 'story', 'centers', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Shawn', 'McNamara', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Christian', 'Troy', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'are', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'Miami', 'FL', 'Shawn', 'married', 'family', 'guy', 'Christian', 'different', 'woman', 'night', 'sleeps', 'crazy', 'Shawn', 'married', 'wife', 'Julia', 'Joley', 'Richardson', 'have', 'one', 'teenage', 'son', 'John', 'Hensley', 'one', 'daughter', 'actually', 'hard', 'write', 'review', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'lines', 'anything', 'one', 'shows', 'once', 'start', 'watching', 'have', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'week', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'lot', 'TV', 'shows', 'days', 'reality', 'TV', 'running', 'rampant.My', 'best', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'check', 'out', 'show', 'FX', 'channel', 'see', 'like', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'are', 'anything', 'enjoy', 'one-hour', 'dramas', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'DVD', 'set', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', 'good.Special', 'Features', 'are', '3', 'documentaries', 'liked', 'gag', 'reel', 'actually', 'quite', 'funny', 'one', 'deleted', 'scene', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'Perfect', 'Lie', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'supplements', 'considering', 'most', 'DVD', 'sets', 'TV', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'squat']",Nip/Tuck: Season 1

Yes, the characters can be vapid and stupid. Yet the parts that make you think are really more the people who come in and out of their lives. Sean's character I can't stand, but like any good character foil is needed.

It is a story of two Miami based plastic surgeons and the drama of their friendship, careers, personal lives, and other social difficulties. From the first second, it is a wild ride - amazing pace, incredible situations, twists and turns, and it is very well done. I did not watch this show when it first started but my younger son is a huge fan and he always tells me how much I've been missing. Finally, he gave me the First season on DVDs for my birthday. I trust my son's taste in shows - because of his high recommendations I started to watch ""24"" and was completely blown away with its first season. Anyway, ""Nip/Tuck"" is very controversial, and its graphical surgeries moments are difficult to watch - do not watch it when you eat or right after your dinner - but it is entertaining, twisted, smart, and disturbing.The creators of ""Nip/Tuck"" did a really great job on the show with truly interesting characters - no one is perfect, they all are flawed but compelling.

Sean McNamara played by Dylan Walsh has a partner, Christian troy (Julian McHahom) and even though he seems to have the perfect life. Being a successful surgeon including a wife and two kids, he's depressed and doesn't feel good about himself, his marriage is almost destroyed and his relationship with his partner isn't the best. On the other side there's Christian who happends to be the opposite. He's single, dates the best girls in Miami, lives life freshly and in a way he has the driving wheel of his clinic next to Sean. Everything goes fine for Christian and Sean at work until one day they have the visit of a undergrounded personage who is going to give them lots of problems. This is so serious that they even get one step from going bankruptcy. On the love field, while Sean is trying to safe his marriage, his wife and Christian have some encounters, Christian gets involved in problems with two girls...anyway it's impossible to even blink your eyes because everything goes from interesting to much more interesting while you go through other episodes.The stories are very good, the actors are flawless, the speacial effects are one of the best from the series nowadays but the only defect about this show is that the locations are poor, the producers should've concentrated more on locations beacuse Christian's appartment and Sean's house aren't nice at all and you don't get to see anything from Miami because I even think that they shoot in Miami. It would've been great if they gave footages from Miami as they do on CSI Miami, buy well the episodes are so good that this goes to a second level.This DVD edition includes some interesting speacial features including the making of 3 documentaries showing how cast and creators work, some deleted scenes, a music video from the theme ""A perfect lie"", subtitles in English, Sapanish and French among other special features.",5,Simply great.,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,2214,"['When', 'Nip/Tuck', 'was', 'released', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'called', 'attetion', 'now', '3', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'gave', 'shoot', 'bought', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did.The', 'series', 'are', 'life', 'two', 'best', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'Miami', 'who', 'prefection', 'luxury', 'hide', 'secrets', 'drama', 'Sean', 'McNamara', 'played', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'partner', 'Christian', 'troy', 'Julian', 'McHahom', 'even', 'have', 'perfect', 'life', 'Being', 'successful', 'surgeon', 'including', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'depressed', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'marriage', 'almost', 'destroyed', 'relationship', 'partner', ""n't"", 'best', 'other', 'side', 'Christian', 'who', 'be', 'opposite', 'single', 'best', 'girls', 'Miami', 'life', 'freshly', 'way', 'driving', 'wheel', 'clinic', 'next', 'Sean', 'Everything', 'fine', 'Christian', 'Sean', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'have', 'visit', 'undergrounded', 'personage', 'who', 'going', 'give', 'lots', 'problems', 'so', 'serious', 'even', 'get', 'one', 'step', 'going', 'bankruptcy', 'love', 'field', 'Sean', 'trying', 'safe', 'marriage', 'wife', 'Christian', 'have', 'encounters', 'Christian', 'involved', 'problems', 'two', 'girls', 'impossible', 'even', 'blink', 'eyes', 'everything', 'interesting', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'go', 'other', 'episodes.The', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'flawless', 'speacial', 'effects', 'are', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'nowadays', 'only', 'defect', 'show', 'locations', 'are', 'poor', 'producers', 'should', ""'ve"", 'concentrated', 'more', 'locations', 'Christian', 'appartment', 'Sean', 'house', 'are', ""n't"", 'nice', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'anything', 'Miami', 'even', 'think', 'shoot', 'Miami', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'gave', 'footages', 'Miami', 'do', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'buy', 'well', 'episodes', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'second', 'level.This', 'DVD', 'edition', 'interesting', 'speacial', 'features', 'including', 'making', '3', 'documentaries', 'showing', 'how', 'cast', 'creators', 'work', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'music', 'video', 'theme', 'perfect', 'lie', 'English', 'Sapanish', 'French', 'other', 'special', 'features']",Nip/Tuck: Season 1

812293,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001O3YLM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","I heard about ""Nip/Tuck"" and since it was about plastic surgery, I avoided watching it.  I appreciate the importance of plastic surgery in restoring the looks of patients, but am less enthused by cosmetic surgery to improve personal appearance, mainly because I do not consider being pretty or handsome to be that important (being neither makes it an easy position to hold).  But more importantly I avoided taking biology in high school and college because I was not going to take a scalpel and start dissecting a frog (or worse).  I still remember the anti-smoking film I saw in health class and how everybody freaked during the lung cancer operation.  It was not taking out the diseased lung, but the bit where the surgeon cut into his chest that had everybody gagging.  But several students recommended the series and I decided to check it out.  Surprisingly I made it all the way to Episode 24, ""Natasha Charles,"" before I got to something that freaked me and had me yelling ""No!"" over and over again so loudly my wife came running because she thought something had happened to me (you will know it when you see it, and that is all I can say if I want to continue writing this review).Of course the show is not really about plastic surgery, although in pretty much every episode there comes a point where we get to see it performed.  ""Nip/Tuck"" is about the people who require the surgery and the surgeons who perform it.  In Miami we find McNamara/Troy, a plastic surgery practice co-owned by Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and his best friend, Christian Troy (Julian McMahon).  Sean is married to his college sweetheart, Julia McNamara (Joely Richardson), and has two children, a teenage son named Matt (John Hensley) and a younger daughter named Annie (Kelsey Lynn Batelaan).  There is something of a love triangle between Sean, Christian, and Julia, but what is pivotal to the dynamic of the show are not the feelings that Christian and Julia have or still have for each other.  Central to the series is that fact that in the final analysis, Sean cares more for his best friend than he does for himself.  Beyond that it is painfully obvious that Sean and Christian are the sort of opposites that make for good partners: Christian has yet to find anybody he loves more than himself, and Sean will always put the welfare of others before his own.  These tragic flaws do not turn every episodes into a mini-Greek tragedy, but there are moments of pain.The patients that come to McNamara/Troy are the catalyst for what happens, and if there is often a dramatic irony that exists between the problems of the patient and the ongoing personal traumas of the main characters, we should not be that surprised.  The initial question that patients are asked is ""Tell me what you don't like about yourself?""  The point of the question is about their appearance, but obvious the answer runs deeper than the person's skin.  It does not take long to establish that patients of all kinds come to McNamara/Troy for surgery.  So there are patients who need plastic surgery after a car accident (""Cara Fitzgerald"") and those who want it for cosmetic reasons, such as a pair of twins who want to look different from each other (""Mandi/Randi"").  Each episode is named for the primary patient, but you only know the titles from the menus.  This matters only on a few episodes where the title is for one of the main or supporting characters, in which case you know they are going to need medical attention by the end of the episode.There are a couple of key story arcs throughout the first season, starting (and ending) with the drug lord Escobar Gallardo (Robert La Sardo), after Troy operates on somebody who wants to hide from Gallardo, who becomes more and more involved in their business, sending them mules from Columbia are smuggling drugs in breast implants.  Merril Bobolit (Joey Slotnick), a rival plastic surgeon, takes away business from McNamara/Troy by using advertising and other tricks, while Mrs. Grubman (Ruth Williamson) has developed an addiction to plastic surgery.  Meanwhile, somebody is vandalizing Troy's possessions, Sean becomes close with a patient (Julie Warner), and a transsexual named Sophia Lopez (Jonathan Del Arco) develops a friendship with Liz Cruz (Roma Maffia), the resident anesthesiologist.  Consequently, each episode has a self-contained story, but each is part of the larger picture and the image in the mirror is a constant reminder that looks are not everything.

Yes, the surgeries can get a little ""gruesome"" at times, but overall, they simply are icing on the cake of this multi-layered, fascinating and unique television show.  Not only are the plastic surgeons performing surgery, but they are also dealing with their mid-life crises on a daily basis via parenting, married life, sex, money, etc.  And just because these 2 surgeons are rich doesn't make them happy - again, ""Money doesn't buy happiness"".All I have to say is:  ""Watch this show""!

812297,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B0001O3YLM,"L P ""lilip""","[1, 1]","Seasons 1 and 2 of Nip/Tuck were brilliant. And I mean it. I think the writing was one of the best in television history: intelligent, engaging, thought provoking, edgy and just breathtaking. It set the standard for TV dramas and writing in all subsequent years if you ask me. The story lines were believable yet provocative and the topics picked were right at the heart of the matter. Because the characters were written with so much depth, layer and nuances, their struggles were believable and the audience could identify and often sympathize. For the first two years I really believed this to have been the best TV drama I had ever seen.Unfortunately, it all went downhill starting Season 3. I dont know if they changed writers or just got blinded by their success and didnt try as hard, but Nip/Tuck made a downhill run starting in Season 3 until the abysmal failure which was the last season: increasingly improbable, far fetched situations that take the notion of suspending disbelief to new heights, bad to no character development (at least not one that is believable), unimaginative writing that is all over the place, everyone acting supremely out of character...I could go on with more examples. There just wasn't much depth in the characters later on and in fact at some point they became a parody of themselves it seems. The writers took the ""sudden twists"" in plot development that were gripping and enticing in the first two seasons and sprinkled them excessively in every episode to the point where it became almost ridiculous. While in the beginning they used those sparingly to get the desired effect, it was just overdone in later seasons - ultimately causing the show to lose exactly what it tried to accomplish.As mentioned above, people behaving out of character was another prominent feature of the later seasons:Yes, Christian Troy is a womanizer and playboy who loves luxury, hot girls and shiny cars, but he is also a wounded soul, a caring man who deep down has demons to fight while at the same time trying to hold on to certain principles he would never relinquish. In later seasons, they just turned him into a vile, ruthless, unsympathetic, one dimensional animal who is lacking a moral center. While he had some endearing qualities in the beginning, he had none in the end. He was a weak, mean coward who lost his edge and humanity.Sean, who was always the thoughtful, loyal, dedicated and responsible person and especially father, was turned into a big time jerk and sex maniac in the later seasons - a man who had no interest in his family and his children and who slept around and used people.The same is true with most of the characters really. Julia, (Joely Richardson), was a driving force in this series. Her struggles of wanting to go to med school and being more than just a house wife, as well as her subdued, unspoken love and attraction for Christian were an important relationship and plot element. Gradually, she made fewer and fewer appearances, however, became a lesbian at some point (yeah right) - stating she had always been one - and then she sort of disappeared for extended periods of time without explanation or closure. Her passion for medical school and her own life were never even touched upon again and she herself disappeared into obscurity. That was sad, because Julia's presence and the tensions that had developed between her, Christian and Sean were at the heart of the show and its drama. They spent two years building all that up just to drop the subject altogether and never revisit it again.Speaking of unresolved: Gina just completely disappeared at some point without explanation and then came back just to die in the most absurd, ridiculous way you can imagine: she fell during sex out of the balcony. I really thought they were kidding and this was just someone's day dream or imagination but lo and behold, that was it: she really fell off the balcony during sex. Not only was that ridiculous but also sad in a way and just insulting to what the writers had done with the character in the first place. I always found Gina very fascinating and tragic; the self destruction, low self esteem, the fact that she was Wilbur's mother and her battle with HIV. Her character was filled with potential and they just let her fizzle out and then die in this embarrassing, trashy manner. Totally insulting. I wonder what Christian will tell Wilbur when he asks about his mother one day.There is also Kimber, another deeply tragic character who ended up being very underutilized given the potential the writers had with her. They did an amazing job exposing her self destructive tendencies and low self esteem, but then just like that, they dropped her and she too became a two-dimensional paper doll and a clich&eacute;. Christian marries her on and off over the seasons, but nothing in their dynamic with each other changes. She doesnt develop as a character for either the better or the worst. I saw a glimpse of hope when she got that abortion and it turned out she could never have kids again - gosh that entire plot segment was filled with potential for her character and the implications of that for Christian - but instead of keeping going on that strong note, they just dropped it and let it fade away. The same thing happened when she died. Did she commit suicide? Is she dead? Is she alive? What exactly happened? We never find out. Her death was not remarkable to anyone - which it should have and could have been had the writers not been so busy making up far fetched bogus stories.There is also that entire plot of Christian marrying Liz. Speak of behaving out of character: Liz always held herself and others to the highest standards. She had a disdain for Chrstian's superficiality and how he used and treated women and she was fully aware of it too. She would *never* have stooped to his level and married him. That was just not her. But they put it in the script and made her whine after Christian and it was ridiculous.If these were changes in plot and character the writers intended, they should have gone about it in a different way (even though there is no excuse for some of the outlandish plot twists they introduced).  People dont just change overnight and fiction or not, you still have to adhere to certain rules such as character consistency within a plot. Sean was portrayed from the beginning on as a hard working, ethical, dedicated father. It is completely out of character for him to suddenly turn into a vile jerk who uses women and doesnt care about his kids. Liz would never have fallen for Christian's sweet talk and married him and then pine away after him, that is ridiculous - not to mention that she is a lesbian.Of course it is possible for people to change but there has to be evidence for it in the story and plot and not simply because the script says so. The later seasons are drizzled with even more such inconsistencies, which is a sign of bad writing more than one of just things having changed due to the circumstances the characters find themselves . Acting out of character is not character development.Finally, changing the setting from Miami to L.A. aided in ruining the show completely. The L.A. setting made them be nothing but a bunch of cheap, trashy, run of the mill Beverly Hills plastic surgeons trying to find a way to sell out to the media by humiliating themselves - sort of like the Kardassians. There is some kind of a mystery, sexiness and just boldness to Miami which L.A.'s theme-park commercialism lacks. In the show, L.A. was portrayed as a den for greedy TV producers and dumb people with non-existent moral codes willing to do anything for a dollar, a d-- ck and a dream. McNamara and Troy just became pawns in that scheme and the stories shifted from them to Los Angeles, the dirt of that town and the despicable people roaming it (to the point of stereotyping the city).  That was a bad move which, in my opinion, pretty much sealed Nip/Tuck's ruin and reduced its quality to just any other forgettable TV show you hope to end.The bottom line is that after the success of the first two seasons, the show's producers and writers put the characters into increasingly more improbable situations to the point of turning them into clich&eacute;s of themselves and the show as such; coupled with the issues mentioned above - such as character inconsistency and poor, chaotic plot development - the result has been that over time a serious disconnect has been created and once you have too many of those disconnects, you lose credibility. And I think that is the main breaking point in the end: the show lost a lot of credibility, unintentionally became a farce of itself and with that it lost the edge and brilliance that made it so amazing and intense in the first place.",3,"Brilliant Series That Experienced a Tragic Downfall Beginning Season 3, Culminating in An Abysmal Ending",1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,8803,"['Seasons',

It is totally engaging.The two plastic surgeons are long term partners, with contrasting styles.  McNamara is the man of conscience, and compassion, and a family man.  Troy is a damaged amoral narcissist with a penchant for money, good things and gorgeous women. It is up to McNamara to supply his moral compass.  As you can imagine, this dynamic creates a much drama and conflict.Joely Richardson plays McNamara's embittered angry wife, as they are struggling though the difficult part of marriage.

Among a string of wonderful new shows on the FX Network, Nip/Tuck was a jewel! It is edgy, brilliant and definitely well written. And I love the fact that there is always some plot twist that was completely unexpected.For an hour (probably more like 35 to 40 minutes) you enter a world the superficial world of brilliant Plastic Surgeons Sean McNamara and Christian Troy. Beginning each consultation with ""tell me what you don't like about yourself"", they set out to fix or improve those things that their clients hate about themselves. Everything it appears can be fixed with the services of a fine surgeon and a scalpel.Sean (played by Dylan Walsh) is the more talented Surgeon whose life appears on the surface to be perfect (2 kids and a loving wife, Julia). Conservative and straight laced, Sean is the perfect alter-ego to sex crazed Christian.  Christian (played by Julian McMahon of Charmed) is the more sophisticated of the two, but finds himself ""bedding"" one woman (and sometimes two) in every episode. Having one meaningless sexual relationship after another, appears to interest him more often than a complicated surgery.  Liz, their anesthesiologist and friend, is constantly trying to show Christian the error of his ways, while assisting them both by performing some very complicated and creative surgeries. Soon you will find that the creative and wonderful storylines have pulled you into the dazzling world of McNamara-Troy, and you have simply fallen in love with this wonderful show, and looking forward to every episode. I can only hope that Season 2 lives up to Season 1.

812302,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0001O3YLM,Mitch Weaver,"[13, 14]","Plastic surgeons Dr. Sean McNamara(Dylan Walsh)and Dr. Christian Troy(Julian McMahon)have been best friends since college, and run one of the best and most profitable practices in all of Florida. However, their personal lives often get in the way. Sean's marriage to his wife Julia(Joely Richardson)is on the rocks and he has trouble connecting with his teenage son Matt(John Hensley)which causes Sean to begin going through a mid-life crisis. Christian is a ladies man who has seemingly slept with half of the women in Florida. His &quot;love them then leave them&quot; lifestyle often gets him into trouble. Christian also lacks ethics, drinks too much, and is willing to operate on just about anyone to keep the money rolling in. Each episode of Nip/Tuck deals with a particular patient that Sean and Christian are operating on, along with everything that is going on in their personal lives as well.When I first heard about Nip/Tuck I was highly skeptical because a show that is based on plastic surgery does not sound all that entertaining. However, if there was ever a time to apply the rule of &quot;never judge a book by its cover&quot; it is with this show.  Even though the effects of the sugeries themselves are groundbreaking and extremely graphic, there is only about 10-15 minutes of actual plastic surgery in each episode. What makes Nip/Tuck such a great show, is the fact that the storytelling and episode quality is so good that it is almost unreal. While the patients that Sean and Christian operate on differ from episode to episode, the overall story of what is happening in their personal lives manages to continue and build throughout the season. For a show that is supposed to deal with something as superficial as plastic surgery, Nip/Tuck has incredible depth to it. Actors Dylan Walsh and Julian McMahon seem like they were made for the show, and manage to bring Sean and Christian to life with their amazing performances. Nip/Tuck is also as addictive as any show I have ever seen. Each episode you are hooked from the time you hear the show's wonderful catch phrase &quot;tell me what you don't like about yourself&quot; to the end credits. Last but not least, is the wonderful music that the show features. You get everything from songs of the 80's to current hit music. The soundtrack is definately one worth owning.Overall, Nip/Tuck is definately one of the best shows on television today. You get everything from great performances and wonderful music, to amazing special effects and top notch storytelling. I was extremely happy when the first season of the show came to DVD. Not only do you get all thirteen episodes commercial free, but wonderful bonus features as well.

812303,A25AXWGBGJ5KBS,B0001O3YLM,"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo""","[213, 224]","Wow did I love this series! I missed it during the original broadcast, but based on what people have told me, I gambled on this box set. I feel like I hit the jackpot.It's definitely not for everyone though. No sirree.First of all, if you're squeamish, the brilliantly reproduced surgeries can be a bit nauseating. (I'm a surgeon, and I loved 'em. My wife, an ex-nurse, had to close her eyes...)Second, if you are at all uncomfortable with the topic of sex, stay away. This series will plant you into situations you have not even imagined. Bouncing between hilarity and discomfort, sex is definitely a theme throughout the 13 shows.Third, if you appreciate good acting, it does not get any better than this. Seriously. This is ""Sopranos"" good; ""NYPD Blue"" good. The two lead performances are pitch-perfect, both deeply flawed and often morally reprehensible individuals who at the end of the day, you can't help but root for. The ""supporting"" players are a heck lot more than that, and provide tons of drama, amusement and eye candy.There is beauty and ugliness everywhere, from an absolutely gorgeous female figure to a purely evil drug dealing psychopath. That's just in one episode.Fourth, the screenwriting is bling-bling eye-popping, smart as all hell and consistently surprising. The thirteen episodes link nicely together, the first ones dovetailing back into the last ones. I was constantly taken aback at the twists, the lines, the situations they came up with. Let's just say that I learned in the very first episode that crocodiles prefer ham to human flesh. And that fact is actually  important to the story...I haven't even had a chance to go through what appears to be fairly extensive supplements and deleted scenes. I HAD to write in...I will recommend this to ANYONE, anyone over 18 I should say, who likes good television and may like to be pleasantly shocked from time to time.With great restraint I have withheld many (if not all) plot points, because the exhilarating thrill of discovering them on your own is something you'll only feel once. Without spoiling too much, the show centers on the Miami plastic surgery practice of McNamara/Troy.Sean McNamara is a questionably happily married man, with one teenage son, and one grade schooler daughter.Julia, the wife, is plagued by doubts surrounding her love for her husband, the urge to go back to medical school and sexual attractions/distractions galore.One of whom might be Christian Troy, Sean's best friend and partner, and one of the most gleefully decadent characters in TV history. I mean ""decadent"" in a good way. Sort of.His travails include, but in no way are limited to, a continuing parade of sexual partners, a number of hysterical surgical propositions, problems involving his boat, his cars, his apartment and the plastic surgery competition across town.Other important characters include the melting hot staff psychologist and the defiant, embittered, proudly lesbian anesthesiologist. The cast has such chemistry that they not only react to one another, they generate this bubbly heat together...it's fun to watch them prod each other to new heights.The one thing that struck me the most about these shows is the amount of genuine heart that stands at the center of each episode. There is a large amount of provocative, politically incorrect but unassailable truth here...nothing you'd like to admit, but stuff you instantly recognize. As you get to know these characters, establshing empathy for them is easy. It's darn near irresistible. I was hooked from the first five minutes.I could write more, but I need to go check out the extras, AND the four NEW episodes I have on tape. I have just GOT to get my Tivo hooked up...",5,"Searingly hot-sexy, provocative, involving.",1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,3714,"['Wow', 'did', 'love', 'series', 'missed', 'original', 'broadcast', 'based', 'what', 'people', 'have', 'told', 'gambled', 'box', 'set', 'feel', 'hit', 'jackpot.It', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'sirree.First', ""'re"", 'squeamish', 'brilliantly', 'reproduced', 'surgeries', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'nauseating', ""'m"", 'surgeon', 'loved', 'My', 'wife', 'ex-nurse', 'had', 'close', 'eyes', 'Second', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'topic', 'sex', 'stay', 'away', 'series', 'will', 'plant', 'situations', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'imagined', 'Bouncing', 'hilarity', 'discomfort', 'sex', 'definitely', 'theme', '13', 'shows.Third', 'appreciate', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'Seriously', 'Sopranos', 'good', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'good', 'two', 'lead', 'performances', 'are', 'pitch-perfect', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'often', 'morally', 'reprehensible', 'individuals', 'who', 'end', 'day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'heck', 'lot', 'more', 'provide', 'tons', 'drama', 'amusement', 'eye', 'candy.There', 'beauty', 'ugliness', 'everywhere', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'female', 'figure', 'purely', 'evil', 'drug', 'dealing', 'psychopath', 'just', 'one', 'episode.Fourth', 'screenwriting', 'bling-bling', 'eye-popping', 'smart', 'hell', 'consistently', 'surprising', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'link', 'nicely', 'together', 'first', 'ones', 'dovetailing', 'back', 'last', 'ones', 'was', 'constantly', 'taken', 'aback', 'twists', 'lines', 'situations', 'came', 'up', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'learned', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'prefer', 'ham', 'human', 'flesh', 'fact', 'actually', 'important', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'go', 'what', 'be', 'fairly', 'extensive', 'supplements', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'HAD', 'write', 'will', 'recommend', 'ANYONE', 'anyone', '18', 'should', 'say', 'who', 'good', 'television', 'may', 'like', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'shocked', 'time', 'time.With', 'great', 'restraint', 'have', 'withheld', 'many', 'not', 'plot', 'points', 'exhilarating', 'thrill', 'discovering', 'own', 'something', ""'ll"", 'only', 'feel', 'once', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'centers', 'Miami', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'practice', 'McNamara/Troy.Sean', 'McNamara', 'questionably', 'happily', 'married', 'man', 'one', 'teenage', 'son', 'one', 'grade', 'schooler', 'daughter.Julia', 'wife', 'plagued', 'doubts', 'surrounding', 'love', 'husband', 'urge', 'go', 'back', 'medical', 'school', 'sexual', 'attractions/distractions', 'galore.One', 'whom', 'might', 'be', 'Christian', 'Troy', 'Sean', 'best', 'friend', 'partner', 'one', 'most', 'gleefully', 'decadent', 'characters', 'TV', 'history', 'mean', 'decadent', 'good', 'way', 'Sort', 'of.His', 'travails', 'include', 'way', 'are', 'limited', 'continuing', 'parade', 'sexual', 'partners', 'number', 'hysterical', 'surgical', 'propositions', 'problems', 'involving', 'boat', 'cars', 'apartment', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'competition', 'town.Other', 'important', 'characters', 'include', 'melting', 'hot', 'staff', 'psychologist', 'defiant', 'embittered', 'proudly', 'lesbian', 'anesthesiologist', 'cast', 'such', 'chemistry', 'not', 'only', 'react', 'one', 'generate', 'bubbly', 'heat', 'together', 'fun', 'watch', 'prod', 'other', 'new', 'heights.The', 'one', 'thing', 'struck', 'most', 'shows', 'amount', 'genuine', 'heart', 'center', 'episode', 'large', 'amount', 'provocative', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'unassailable', 'truth', 'here', 'nothing', ""'d"", 'like', 'admit', 'stuff', 'instantly', 'recognize', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'establshing', 'empathy', 'easy', 'darn', 'irresistible', 'was', 'hooked', 'first', 'five', 'minutes.I', 'could', 'write', 'more', 'need', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'extras', 'four', 'NEW', 'episodes', 'have', 'tape', 'have', 'just', 'GOT', 'get', 'Tivo', 'hooked', 'up']",Nip/Tuck: Season 1

Durham ""Big Evil""","[6, 7]","With the shocking sucess of The Shield, FX began turning out some all new original programing, and Nip/Tuck is one of the better shows to come from the cable network.  Revolving around the sordid lives of two, hot shot Miami plastic surgeons: the married with children Sean (Dylan Walsh) and the womanizing and possibly sex-addicted Christian (Julian McMahon).  Both of whom are good at their jobs, and despite being longtime friends, are in many ways polar opposites of each other.  Sean's wife Julia (Joely Richardson) has dilemmas of her own as well, but none as dire as when the two surgeons find themselves reluctantly employed, and under the gun, by a Latino druglord named Escobar.  Nip/Tuck's mix of realisticly graphic surgery scenes and equally graphic sex make the show compulsively addictive viewing; despite the fact that it's a little rough around the edges in some spots.  The two male leads are perfectly cast, and even though everything may seem to be wrapped up by the last episode's end, the currently running season two proves things are far from being ok.

812312,A361LE16VBQDP8,B0001O3YLM,Robert Bezimienny,"[17, 42]","Having rented the DVD for one week, as the proverbial guilty pleasure, we arranged ourselves comfortably in front of the TV and proceeded to watch the first four episodes in one sitting. However, the next day when it came to reinserting the discs for the remainder we looked at each other and reconsidered.  The discs were returned unwatched.  Life is too short.*The characters, in the end, were just not involving enough.  Julian MacMahon's Dr.Christian Troy is an extreme but oddly empty creation.  He is at his most engaging when he is being naughty, in a Benny Hill/Donald Trump kind of way.  His rather simplistic narcissism milks the same politically incorrect shocks time and again.  A cultural critic (preferably with a French or German surname) could well read this character, if not the show entire, as an interesting reflection upon the conflicting and layered attitudes towards sexuality that pervade American culture, but such an article would be of interest to the few, and read by the fewer.  Instead it might be more helpful to point out that Mr.MacMahon has spent many hours in the gym, that his mother was outrageously beautiful and that his father was a former Prime Minister of Australia, and that with such a pedigree he acquits himself marvellously well in the MTV-style sex scenes which grace this show with a disarming frequency.  His teeth are impeccably capped, his body hair neatly coiffured, and his acting technique a wonderful blend of Jean Paul Belmondo, Brad Dourif, and Marcello Mastroianni.  His flaws, however engaging, are quite cliched, and even after four episodes seemed doomed to a trite explanation at some future point, probably involving a revelation of childhood abuse, along with Angela Lansbury in a cameo as his mother, reprising her roles in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Gaslight"".*Dr.Sean McNamara has no eyebrows and no lips.  He also has no coherent personality, his actions and dialogue gaining in unpredictability what they lose in believability.  The price to be paid for this is that it becomes difficult to care about his character.  And this might well be said to be core problem with this show: the audience doesn't care about the characters.  Yes, if Dr.Troy died there would be no show, but if he were injured, that would be okay (although an ellipsis was necessary when his so-called virile member was incapacitated by botulinum toxin); if Dr.McNamara died, a replacement might be necessary; and if his wife, Julia, died, or the psychologist was fired, or the gerbil drowned...the impact would indeed be soft.*Reality TV has no doubt also softened the impact of the plastic surgery scenes, but they remain slighty more gory than the rucks and mauls in a Tri-Nations Rugby fixture.  ""CSI"" seems to tap into a similar fascination with corporeal mortality, choosing likewise to dress deep issues in the veneer of greusome physicality. Surgery (and possibly Rugby) appears to be the new pornography. The contrary might also be relevant, in that the gruesome is rendered trivial, so disguising the disturbing reality of our current (and the historical) world, where the most greusome acts are actually amongst the most serious.*""Nip/Tuck"" crowded the following issues into four episodes - the adult video industry, prostitution, lesbian sex, transexuality, the aesthetics of circumcision, cosmetic breast and buttock implants, penile enlargement, lap-dancing, a menage-a-trois involving twin teenage girls, attempted sodomy, pedophilia, along with some scattered observations relating to the ethics of practising medicine solely for financial gain.  I suppose that on balance the show could be said to be preoccupied with sexuality.  So too its predescesors in spirit, such as Sex in the City, L.A.Law and Hill Street Blues.  Part of the thrill of all these shows is the simple utterance of words and ideas previously  prohibited from the public domain.  Perhaps it is important that censorship is in fact relaxed, but endless instances of this relaxation seems less important and less interesting.  It is possible to become bored by Dr.Troy's next sexual outrage.  Frankly, that's one reason we did not bother with episode five, et al - the outrage was becoming boring.*Look, watch this.  Be amused.  Read a bit of Freud, or Bion, or Baudrillard.  Sing the Star-Spangled Banner and get a wax job.

Frankly, while Six Feet Under has started to run out of gas, having turned most of its characters into overcooked zombies, this show seems to be able to get the temperature in the furnace where it needs to be every episode. There are some simple reasons for this. One is that this show isn't stuffed full of fantasy and dream sequences (like SFU, for example). Another is that the core of this show is much stronger than that of SFU. Whereas many shows play gumby with their characters until there is nothing left, this show works on core situations and does so extremely well. Sometimes it's a meditation on the inability to keep things in balance without massive amounts of denial, often it tackles basic elements of relationships powerfully. Ultimately, the edge this show has is that it doesn't cop out and recede into cliche as so many other shows do.All that said, this doesn't come out completely nickless. For example, the first season was incredibly strong, but the last scene of the finale was insanely stupid, followed by a shot of the stars mooning the camera.... unbelievably cheap and dumb. And this season, the episode in which they had to separate the siamese twins was pretty silly, given the metaphorical transparency. The real fear though is that the writers will go overboard and this thing will jump the shark, as it were, by piling up the trials on these characters until it becomes the story of Job (fate of most serials), like Nate on SFU, leading to just bloodless boredom.

I received Nip/Tuck Season One as an unwanted gift, and have been hooked on the show ever since.  Following the lines of a very adult soap opera revolving around a plastic surgery practice, Nip/Tuck saves itself from being ordinary with some truly phenomenal surgery FX and the best soundtrack since Michael Mann's 'Miami Vice'.  With the expert blending of visual and audio into a sensory treat, you immediately become attracted to the show.  Then, you will stick around for the gruesome surgery scenes and the $ex.  My friend said I would like the show because I am a horror fan (the realistic and bloody surgeries), and he was right.The characters are irritatingly predictable and irritatingly unpredictable, if that makes sense.  Just when you think you have them figured out, they do something stupider than usual.  But with the excellent casting, the actors manage to pull off some pretty lame dialogue and keep the show not just interesting but compelling.At McNamara/Troy, Dr. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Dr. Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) are at odds with each other.  Together since med school, the two are completely separate personality types.  Sean is quiet, timid, and stuck in a rut in his marriage to Julia (Joely Richardson).  Christian is a narcissistic, womanizing, shallow, and carefree bachelor.  The super-talented Roma Maffia plays anesthesiologist Liz Cruz, always at odds with arrogant Christian.In Season One, the character plots introduce us to Kimber Henry (played by model-beautiful Kelly Carlson) as one of Christian's conquests.  Kimber becomes part of the regular cast.  The clinic hires psychiatric consultant Grace Santiago (Valerie Cruz).  The doctors find themselves involved chest deep with a vicious drug lord who begins to use their practice for smuggling heroin inside breast implants, Sean has to come to grips with a transsexual patient, and Julia fights off her desire to reunite with Christian after all these years. Matt McNamara (John Hensley), Sean and Julia's teenage son, gets high with a friend and runs down a young girl with their car.  The clinic's most notorious patient, Mrs. Grubman, receives free surgery for life because Sean leaves a cauterizing tip in her abdomen.  Matt wants Sean and Christian to operate on her though her religious mother refuses.  Dr. Bobolit's practice is running McNamara/Troy into the ground, and Christian trades Kimber for Bobolit's Lamborghini.  Christian's one night stand with witchy Gina Russo (Jessalyn Gilsig) evolves into fatherhood, but there's a surprise in the delivery room.  Sean has an affair with a patient, and this is just skimming the surface of the plotlines.My favorite character in Season One would have to be Escobar Gallardo, the brutal, tattooed drug lord who inadvertently teaches Sean how to get in touch with his violent, masculine side.  The ending of Season One is a great blow out episode with Escobar.Some of the surgeries performed to tricked out music are face-lifts, boobjobs, liposuction, botox shots, and a hilarious scene where Sean's cadaver head during his board exam starts talking to him.All said, Nip/Tuck is a slick, glitzy soap opera with bloody surgeries and very adult $exual themes.  Just what the doctor ordered.  Don't miss out on the extras either, which include a segment on how they achieved their realistic FX, and a funny outtakes clip called ""Severed Parts"".

I own season 2, and can't wait for season 3 to come out on DVD so I can add it to my collection as well.  Nip Tuck is not just another medical show.  It's very unique with the story lines, characters andSeason one we get involved in the twisted relationship of Sean, Christian and Sean's wife Julia who live in Miami Florida.  I say twisted because Christian has feelings for Julia and they had a relationship.  The level of that relationship will come to light by the time the season ends.  We find out that Christian is a serious playa.  He gets involved with Kimber, then Gena, and other women.  Kimber falls in love with him, Gena verbally abuses Christian every chance she gets.  Actually I find the way she speaks to him rather humorous.  They have a love hate relationship that is so intense.  Kimber finds out how much Sean loves her when he trades her for a car.  Nice, real nice.  When she seeks revenge on him later, you can't help but applaud what she does.  Sean has two children, while the daughter does not have a pivotal storyline, the son Matt does.  Matt does a self circumcision after reading about it on the internet.  I normally don't get woozy, but that scene had me crossing my legs and holding a pillow to my face to stifle the screams of terror!  Matt wants to be circumcised for a girl he likes, he later finds out that girl is a lesbian, but agrees to a three some with him.  When Julia catches Matt in the act she demands they meet the other parents to have an intervention.  Turns out the second girl is not a lesbian, but really likes Matt.  Talk about talk show moment.  Rounding out the cast are Roma Maffia as anesthesiologist Liz Cruz who is no nonsense, and always have something to say to Christian.In addition to the main characters are the cases for the show.  Some of these people came in to see the surgeons hoping they will be able to improve their lives.  Nanette Babcock wanting surgery before her high school reunion so she can impress former classmates, and when she is turned down for the surgery she is totally heartbroken.  Sofia Lopez a transsexual was such an interesting storyline.  Showing how it is tough living life as she does.  Megan O'Hara is a breast cancer patient who decides to have reconstructive surgery.  She and Sean end up having an affair, and when her cancer returns it is really heart wrenching.  Escobar the tattooed drug lord who pretty much make Sean and Christian do his bidding.  He has various women smuggling drugs into the US in their breasts.  That is so intense, especially when one of the patients get severely sick, as long as the drugs are okay Esobar could care less about the women.  There is the man who changes his face because he sexually molested his boss's daughter.When Christian realizes what has occurred he is sick with guilt, and Sean is beyond angered they took this man on as a client.  Then there is Ms. Grubman.  She will actually be in season 2 as well, but we are introduced to her in Season 1 and find out about her wanting so much plastic surgery.  When Sean leaves a surgical instrument in her body, and she is tackled by airport security she threatens to sue and ruin everything Sean and Julian worked so hard to accomplish.  Another great story line is Bliss.  She loses weight, and is ready to meet her online love, and has surgery.  When she meets her online love, he is nothing like he said he was.  I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea of what I'm trying to express.  This show is simply fantastic.""You live in Miami and don't speak Spanish"" someone says to Sean.  ""I don't eat, I'm a model.""  There is a scene where Julia is angry about the Gerbil and flushes it down the toilet.  The scene when the plumber finds it is hilarious.Nip Tuck is the type of show you can't really pick one episode you like more then another.  Each episode just gets better and better and you can't wait to see what will happen next.  You simply get hooked to the show, and the characters.  The show is the perfect blend of drama and a touch of humor.  Christian played by Julian McMahon is so handsome, you hate him one minute, love him the next.  The extras on this set are really good.  The set includes blooper reel and deleted scenes.There are so many great moments in this season you simply need to buy your own copy so you can enjoy the show again, and again.",5,This is such an awesome show!!!,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,4463,"['received', 'season', '1', 'Nip', 'Tuck', 'gift', 'friend', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'own', 'season', '2', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '3', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'can', 'add', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'Nip', 'Tuck', 'not', 'just', 'medical', 'show', 'very', 'unique', 'story', 'lines', 'characters', 'andSeason', 'one', 'get', 'involved', 'twisted', 'relationship', 'Sean', 'Christian', 'Sean', 'wife', 'Julia', 'who', 'live', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'say', 'twisted', 'Christian', 'feelings', 'Julia', 'had', 'relationship', 'level', 'relationship', 'will', 'come', 'light', 'time', 'season', 'find', 'out', 'Christian', 'serious', 'playa', 'involved', 'Kimber', 'then', 'Gena', 'other', 'women', 'Kimber', 'love', 'Gena', 'verbally', 'Christian', 'chance', 'Actually', 'find', 'way', 'rather', 'humorous', 'have', 'love', 'hate', 'relationship', 'so', 'intense', 'Kimber', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'Sean', 'when', 'car', 'Nice', 'real', 'nice', 'When', 'revenge', 'later', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'applaud', 'what', 'Sean', 'two', 'children', 'daughter', 'not', 'have', 'pivotal', 'storyline', 'son', 'Matt', 'Matt', 'self', 'circumcision', 'reading', 'internet', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'woozy', 'scene', 'had', 'crossing', 'legs', 'holding', 'pillow', 'face', 'stifle', 'screams', 'terror', 'Matt', 'be', 'circumcised', 'girl', 'later', 'out', 'girl', 'lesbian', 'three', 'When', 'Julia', 'Matt', 'act', 'meet', 'other', 'parents', 'have', 'intervention', 'out', 'second', 'girl', 'not', 'lesbian', 'really', 'likes', 'Matt', 'Talk', 'talk', 'show', 'moment', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Roma', 'Maffia', 'anesthesiologist', 'Liz', 'Cruz', 'who', 'nonsense', 'always', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'Christian.In', 'addition', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'cases', 'show', 'people', 'came', 'see', 'surgeons', 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'improve', 'lives', 'Nanette', 'Babcock', 'wanting', 'surgery', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'can', 'impress', 'former', 'classmates', 'when', 'turned', 'down', 'surgery', 'totally', 'heartbroken', 'Sofia', 'Lopez', 'transsexual', 'was', 'such', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'Showing', 'how', 'tough', 'living', 'life', 'Megan', ""O'Hara"", 'breast', 'cancer', 'patient', 'who', 'have', 'reconstructive', 'surgery', 'Sean', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'affair', 'when', 'cancer', 'returns', 'really', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'Escobar', 'tattooed', 'drug', 'lord', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'make', 'Sean', 'Christian', 'do', 'bidding', 'various', 'women', 'smuggling', 'drugs', 'US', 'breasts', 'so', 'intense', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'patients', 'get', 'severely', 'sick', 'as', 'long', 'drugs', 'are', 'okay', 'Esobar', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'women', 'man', 'who', 'face', 'sexually', 'molested', 'boss', 'daughter.When', 'Christian', 'what', 'occurred', 'sick', 'guilt', 'Sean', 'angered', 'took', 'man', 'client', 'Then', 'Ms.', 'Grubman', 'will', 'actually', 'be', 'season', '2', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'introduced', 'Season', '1', 'find', 'out', 'wanting', 'so', 'much', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'When', 'Sean', 'surgical', 'instrument', 'body', 'tackled', 'airport', 'security', 'sue', 'ruin', 'everything', 'Sean', 'Julian', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'accomplish', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'Bliss', 'weight', 'ready', 'meet', 'online', 'love', 'surgery', 'When', 'online', 'love', 'nothing', 'said', 'was', 'could', 'go', 'think', 'get', 'idea', 'what', ""'m"", 'trying', 'express', 'show', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'live', 'Miami', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Spanish', 'someone', 'Sean', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', ""'m"", 'model', 'scene', 'where', 'Julia', 'angry', 'Gerbil', 'down', 'toilet', 'scene', 'when', 'plumber', 'hilarious.Nip', 'Tuck', 'type', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'pick', 'one', 'episode', 'more', 'then', 'episode', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'simply', 'get', 'hooked', 'show', 'characters', 'show', 'perfect', 'blend', 'drama', 'touch', 'humor', 'Christian', 'played', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'so', 'handsome', 'hate', 'one', 'minute', 'love', 'next', 'extras', 'set', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'set', 'reel', 'deleted', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'moments', 'season', 'simply', 'need', 'buy', 'own', 'copy', 'can', 'enjoy', 'show', 'again', 'again']",Nip/Tuck: Season 1

It was my mother who convinced me to watch the series premier. Once the pilot was over, I was shocked. I couldn't believe how wonderful the acting was for a prime time TV show. The content was edgy and erotic, as was the language.As I continued to watch the series, I saw Sean McNamara and Christian Troy develop and play off each other. Which is displayed by intrepid acting from Dylan Walsh and Julian McMahon. Nip/Tuck would be Nip/Suck if it weren't for the chemistry between both the leads. The history, friendship, conflicts and brotherhood between Sean and Christian is what makes this show work.The supporting cast is also stellar and gives the show a great element of drama. Robert LaSardo has been in every B movie I can think of, but his performances in these season (and cameos in season 2 & 4) are kick amazing!  Joely Richardson can also pull off one of the best American dialects.  The background music is also very fitting for the show, using modern and retro tunes. But the icing on the cake for this show is the writing of the different story lines. They manage to be separate and commingled all at once.This DVD is awesome! It has all 13 episodes from the first season, deleted scenes, and gag reel, documentaries and other cool features. The picture and sound quality is great. The first season of the show is also good because it gives the viewer a great taste of the series and what it has to offer. I have heard many negative reviews about the following seasons, stating that they weren't as good. I disagree, if you like the characters and want the limits to be pushed, then you will love this show. However, if you are a person who doesn't have a taste for darkness, smut, black comedy and melodrama, please don't watch this show.If I had my pick between this show and most movies in the theater, I would go with this show.

812325,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0001O3YLM,trebe,"[0, 0]","With more freedom to explore edgier subject material, series television on cable networks, has made huge strides in the last decade.  FX's Nip/Tuck (2003) is certainly a striking example, as it explores the practice of Miami plastic surgeons Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) and Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh).  Life in the fast lane in south Florida, is a mix of affluence, sex, style, sleaze, superficiality, and excess.  That the series explores different facets of beauty and aesthetics, is not unexpected.  That the doctors' personal lives and relationships, are interwoven deeply into to drama, might also be expected.  However the introduction of a dark criminal element, illegal drugs, drug money, and murder, separates Nip/Tuck, from your average, slick medical drama.The heart of the series is the relationship between Sean and Christian, two long time friends who seem to be have totally opposite personalities and lifestyles.  Sean is a skilled surgeon, who appears to be dedicated to his wife Julia (Joely Richardson), and family.  Christian uses his good looks and prestige as a surgeon, to try and bang every hot chick that comes his way.  Aesthetician Liz Cruz (Roma Mafia), helps keep the practice viable.  The graphic presentation of various surgical procedures, will become one of the trademarks of the series.There are some occasional slips, but Nip/Tuck is generally superbly written, with extremely compelling stories, that are often provocative, controversial, and touching.  There are some superficial characters, and some seemingly unrealistic situations, but the writing and acting is often so solid, that it overcomes weaknesses.  Even the unlikely, can seem quite palatable.  The series shifts focus onto different characters, often exploring offbeat subjects, and taking many dramatic twists.  Give the show half a chance, and Nip/Tuck can become quite addicting, as it is easy to develop connections with the various characters.The show's talented cast is a huge plus.  John Hensley, aged 26 at the time, convincing plays 16 year old Matt McNamara, who not only tries to remove his own foreskin, but also runs over a classmate.  Kelly Carlson (The Marine), is Kimber Henry, a striking beauty, interested in going from an 8, to a 10.  She is under the mistaken impression, that Christian has a heart.  Grace Santiago (Valerie Cruz) the office psychologist, is not quite the detached, all business professional, she appears.  Gina Russo (Jessalyn Gilsig) takes Christian to a place no other woman has before, and then delivers an ironic surprise.  Dr. Merril Bobolit (Joey Slotnick), provides contrast, as a rival plastic surgeon, who has an attitude similar to Christian's about the business, and what constitutes success.  And Robert LaSardo is a deadly snake preying on humanity, as ruthless drug dealer Escobar Gallardo, a man who threatens to destroy many lives.With a certain voyeuristic appeal to peer into a world based largely on superficiality, and artificial enhancements, Nip/Tuck is not for everyone.  The attitude expressed towards women, by doctors Troy and Bobolit, may not be laudable, but it just one of many points of view explored, in this very compelling drama.  Nip/Tuck is currently winding up its sixth, and final season on FX.  Check it out on cable, to see if it catches your fancy.

Those with sensitive stomachs will not appreciate the close-ups of the plastic surgery, while certain sensibilities will be offended by the sexual activities of the various characters.Other than that, there is a lot to bite into here.  Two best friends are plastic surgeons and face a constant barrage of ethical dilemmas, challenging patients, a dangerous drug runner who forces them to remove heroin from female ""mules,"" and more.Then there are the family conflicts.  Dr. MacNamara's wife was close to his partner, Dr. Troy, who is now the godfather (and possibly father!) to their kids.  Troy himself has a troubled past that causes him a lot of distress when he confronts a priest who has been molesting boys.And MacNamara and spouse very nearly destroy their marriage with infidelity, lies, and secrets; while their teenage son experiments sexually and also tries to cover up a hit-and-run that he was involved in.Slick Miami settings and messed-up people who are attractive on the outside but damaged goods inside make this unpredictable, shocking, and memorable.",5,"Shocking, unpredictable, engaging fare",1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,1099,"['Definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'sensitive', 'stomachs', 'will', 'not', 'appreciate', 'close-ups', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'certain', 'sensibilities', 'will', 'be', 'offended', 'sexual', 'activities', 'various', 'characters.Other', 'lot', 'bite', 'here', 'Two', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'face', 'constant', 'barrage', 'ethical', 'dilemmas', 'challenging', 'patients', 'dangerous', 'drug', 'runner', 'who', 'remove', 'heroin', 'female', 'mules', 'more.Then', 'are', 'family', 'conflicts', 'Dr.', 'MacNamara', 'wife', 'was', 'close', 'partner', 'Dr', 'Troy', 'who', 'now', 'godfather', 'possibly', 'father', 'kids', 'Troy', 'troubled', 'past', 'lot', 'distress', 'when', 'priest', 'who', 'been', 'molesting', 'boys.And', 'MacNamara', 'spouse', 'very', 'nearly', 'destroy', 'marriage', 'infidelity', 'secrets', 'teenage', 'son', 'experiments', 'sexually', 'also', 'cover', 'up', 'hit-and-run', 'was', 'involved', 'in.Slick', 'Miami', 'settings', 'messed-up', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'attractive', 'outside', 'damaged', 'goods', 'inside', 'make', 'unpredictable', 'shocking', 'memorable']",Nip/Tuck: Season 1

When it was first released, I thought how can they stretch a theme about two plastic surgeons into a successful series?  Well they have, and each show is both engaging and exciting.Season 1 is worth seeing, but Season 2 is even better!  Many people missed Season 1 on TV, so obtaining this DVD box gives you the chance to see how it all started.In Australia, we are viewing the final episodes of Season 2.  It is so popular here that the Tv Network is broadcasting it twice a week.  Each episode of this latest season is enthralling and hard to switch off. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a series so much.I was not a fan of Julian McMahon before this show mainly because I remembered the shows he was in here in Australia before moving to LA.
