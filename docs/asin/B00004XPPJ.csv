I'd have to say out of all the movies he's been in, i'd rate this one as his best!Not the best movie for Edward Furlong though (&lt;-- i'd have to say T2 for him), but he played his role well..And ya gotta love Danny Trejo... he's great in every movie.This movie is pretty realistic... i mean it's written by an actual convict.. Edward Bunker... and there are actual convicts in the movie as extra's, and not to mention Trejo (who is a real con as well... the special features in this movie explains this, and gives interviews... the special features are awesome..).If you like this movie, look into some more works by Edward Bunker, especially his books, ""Education of a Felon"" etc...I can't express enough on how great movie is, so i'll end my review here... if i could give this movie an infinite amount of stars i would, cuase it's that good.When i was searching for a copy of it, the lowest it sold for was $30, that's what i ended up paying for mine... but i was ready to pay $50 for it... it's definitely worth whatever price it sells for...",5,Best movie ever made!!,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,1239,"['everything', 'i', 'own', 'movie', 'one', 'SACRED', 'one', 'fave..', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'director..', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'amazing', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'movies', 'been', 'i', ""'d"", 'rate', 'one', 'best', 'Not', 'best', 'movie', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'lt', 'i', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'T2', 'played', 'role', 'well..And', 'ya', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'great', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'i', 'mean', 'written', 'actual', 'convict..', 'Edward', 'Bunker', 'are', 'actual', 'convicts', 'movie', 'extra', 'not', 'mention', 'Trejo', 'who', 'real', 'con', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'features', 'movie', 'interviews', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'awesome..', '.If', 'movie', 'look', 'more', 'works', 'Edward', 'Bunker', 'especially', 'books', 'Education', 'Felon', 'etc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'enough', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'so', 'i', ""'ll"", 'end', 'review', 'here', 'i', 'could', 'give', 'movie', 'infinite', 'amount', 'stars', 'would', 'cuase', 'good.When', 'i', 'was', 'searching', 'copy', 'lowest', 'sold', 'was', '30', 'what', 'i', 'ended', 'up', 'paying', 'mine', 'i', 'was', 'ready', 'pay', '50', 'definitely', 'worth', 'price']",Animal Factory
557298,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00004XPPJ,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[3, 6]","Yet another prison movie with a very basic ""plot"": Eddie Furlong is jailed on marijuana charges and is taken under the wing of fellow inmate Willem Dafoe (in another excellent performance) as his protege. The movie is directed by actor Steve Buscemi; who also has a cameo. ANIMAL FACTORY is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Buscemi's RESERVOIR DOGS costar Eddie Bunker. As with almost all prison movies the objective is to escape from the place. One famous sequence from Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY is even ripped off at the movie's climax- and undermines what is otherwise a first class prison flick. Yet another seemingly tacked-on ending.There were a couple of inspired scenes which appealed to my warped sensibilities: Dafoe and Furlong having a conversation via toilet during their placement in solitary confinement; and the tasteful scene where Dafoe slits his wrists, sprays blood all over himself and eats his own doodoo. Nice.Tom Arnold also stands out as a hillbilly who wants to get chummy with Eddie, and scariest of all, Mickey Rourke ""as you've never seen him before"" as Jan The Transexual. It would be better for most film fans if we never see him again, and yup, Mickster gets to say his favourite compound word.

557299,A3E7ZFQNJ47XB7,B00004XPPJ,Brooser Bear,"[3, 3]","This is an intellgent film with a lot of good acting. It does not capitalize on abuse and violence, as a lot of prison films do and gives it a realistic treatment. The only comparable prison pixcture would be ON THE YARD out of the 70's, but this one is more positive in that it offers hope, and that in itself makes Animal Factory more realistic.Willem Dafoe is a living great, and whenever he makes a film he brings in great theatrical elements to his roles. His portrayal of feigning insanity in the hole is a Dafoe original. This film brings in other artists and allows them perform as well. The classic shot pans the yard as you hear the soundtrack and then you actually see a con singing the blues and you realize that it's not just the background music, the guy is actually performing live. Like other prison flicks, this one has its share of the inevitable rape and shankings you would find in a prison film, but this one does not give them the center stage.  It doesn't shy away from the difficult issues that other films avoid, but at the same time you can make a claim that it does hold back on repression, abuse and violence you are bond to find in a real prison. It strives and does a good job breaking stereotypes. Tom Arnold is barely recognizable in a cameo that breaks his mold and I did not recognize Mickey Rourke in the aging drag queen he was playing. You can not fault this film for being unrealistic because films are works of arts and this one actually redeems itself.",5,PRISON BUDDY FLICK WITH AN ORIGINAL TWIST,1004832000,"11 4, 2001",2001,1492,"['intellgent', 'film', 'lot', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'capitalize', 'abuse', 'violence', 'lot', 'prison', 'films', 'do', 'realistic', 'treatment', 'only', 'comparable', 'prison', 'pixcture', 'would', 'be', 'YARD', '70', 'one', 'more', 'positive', 'hope', 'Animal', 'Factory', 'more', 'realistic.Willem', 'Dafoe', 'living', 'great', 'whenever', 'film', 'great', 'theatrical', 'elements', 'roles', 'portrayal', 'feigning', 'insanity', 'hole', 'Dafoe', 'original', 'film', 'other', 'artists', 'perform', 'as', 'well', 'classic', 'shot', 'yard', 'hear', 'soundtrack', 'then', 'actually', 'see', 'con', 'singing', 'blues', 'realize', 'not', 'just', 'background', 'music', 'guy', 'actually', 'performing', 'live', 'other', 'prison', 'flicks', 'one', 'share', 'inevitable', 'rape', 'shankings', 'would', 'find', 'prison', 'film', 'one', 'not', 'give', 'center', 'stage', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'difficult', 'issues', 'other', 'films', 'avoid', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'make', 'claim', 'hold', 'back', 'repression', 'abuse', 'violence', 'are', 'bond', 'find', 'real', 'prison', 'good', 'job', 'breaking', 'stereotypes', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'cameo', 'mold', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'aging', 'drag', 'queen', 'was', 'playing', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'film', 'being', 'unrealistic', 'films', 'are', 'works', 'arts', 'one', 'actually']",Animal Factory

557301,A1G0EBQYLN6STU,B00004XPPJ,Cinephiliac,"[1, 3]","Animal Factory is a prison movie.  The title would imply that the prison system takes even ""nonviolent criminals"" and turns them into savage felons, warehousing them in decaying institutions.  A man may not have been an animal going in, but he will certainly be one coming out.  Unfortunately, the movie is not nearly as edgy or interesting as that sounds.Willem Dafoe plays Earl Copen, a convict at the top of the prison food chain.  Into the mix comes Ron Decker (Edward Furlong), a low level marijuana dealer, whose youth and slight frame would normally mark him for the more predatory prisoners.  When Copen befriends Decker, he is spared the torture and humiliation of another young prisoner coming in at the same time as Decker.  What Copen's motives are in protecting Decker are never fully explained.  Dafoe plays Copen as a convict with a Zen vibe.  Whether or not Copen is seeking redemption or sees Decker as a younger version of himself is open to interpretation.In what I imagine is a fairly accurate depiction of prison life, the days drift by in grinding tedium - men mill about the prison yard; they sit, walk, eat, get high; violence occasionally erupts.  John Lurie's film score punctuates the odd rhythms of the movie.Regrettably, male posturing frequently supplants believable behavior.  Any interior life of these characters is completely masked.  (Perhaps this is a necessity of prison life.)  Edward Furlong's performance is so low key, it barely registers.  Willem Dafoe, an actor of uncommon intensity, does what he can with what is basically a two dimensional character.The main problem I found with the film is that most of the characters keep you at emotional arms-length.  I don't have to love or hate a character to enjoy a film, but I do need to feel something.  Otherwise, you just don't care what happens one way or the other.  One of the few exceptions (despite the snarky title line above) is Mickey Rourke, who plays Jan, Decker's sad and damaged cellmate.  Jan is probably the most accessible character in the film.  You just know you've gone to a really weird place when the character you like and identify the most with is a flamboyant transsexual who dispenses sage advice through missing front teeth and whose makeup is pure Rocky Horror Picture Show.  (Yikes!)Tom Arnold has an especially effective cameo as a vicious bully who is looking to turn Edward Furlong's character into ""Mrs."" creepy hillbilly - or kill him - whichever comes first.  Seymour Cassel has a small role as a world-weary prison guard who would like to help Copen - if only he would let him.Animal Factory definitely has its moments.  It is just that with a cast of this caliber, I expected more.",3,Isn't Mickey Rourke in drag one of the signs heralding the apocalypse?,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,2708,"['Animal', 'Factory', 'prison', 'movie', 'title', 'would', 'imply', 'prison', 'system', 'even', 'nonviolent', 'criminals', 'savage', 'felons', 'warehousing', 'decaying', 'institutions', 'man', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'animal', 'going', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'one', 'coming', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'not', 'nearly', 'edgy', 'interesting', 'Dafoe', 'plays', 'Earl', 'Copen', 'convict', 'top', 'prison', 'food', 'chain', 'mix', 'Ron', 'Decker', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'low', 'level', 'marijuana', 'dealer', 'youth', 'slight', 'frame', 'would', 'normally', 'mark', 'more', 'predatory', 'prisoners', 'When', 'Copen', 'Decker', 'spared', 'torture', 'humiliation', 'young', 'prisoner', 'coming', 'same', 'time', 'Decker', 'What', 'Copen', 'motives', 'are', 'protecting', 'Decker', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'Dafoe', 'Copen', 'convict', 'Zen', 'vibe', 'not', 'Copen', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'Decker', 'younger', 'version', 'open', 'interpretation.In', 'what', 'imagine', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'prison', 'life', 'days', 'drift', 'grinding', 'tedium', 'men', 'mill', 'prison', 'yard', 'sit', 'walk', 'eat', 'get', 'high', 'violence', 'occasionally', 'John', 'Lurie', 'film', 'score', 'odd', 'rhythms', 'movie.Regrettably', 'male', 'posturing', 'frequently', 'believable', 'behavior', 'interior', 'life', 'characters', 'completely', 'masked', 'Perhaps', 'necessity', 'prison', 'life', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'performance', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'barely', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'actor', 'uncommon', 'intensity', 'what', 'can', 'what', 'basically', 'two', 'dimensional', 'character.The', 'main', 'problem', 'found', 'film', 'most', 'characters', 'keep', 'emotional', 'arms-length', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'love', 'hate', 'character', 'enjoy', 'film', 'do', 'feel', 'something', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'One', 'few', 'exceptions', 'snarky', 'title', 'line', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'Jan', 'Decker', 'sad', 'damaged', 'cellmate', 'Jan', 'probably', 'most', 'accessible', 'character', 'film', 'just', 'know', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'really', 'weird', 'place', 'when', 'character', 'identify', 'most', 'flamboyant', 'transsexual', 'who', 'sage', 'advice', 'missing', 'front', 'teeth', 'makeup', 'pure', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Yikes', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'especially', 'effective', 'cameo', 'vicious', 'bully', 'who', 'looking', 'turn', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'character', 'Mrs.', 'creepy', 'hillbilly', 'kill', 'whichever', 'first', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'small', 'role', 'world-weary', 'prison', 'guard', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'help', 'Copen', 'only', 'would', 'let', 'him.Animal', 'Factory', 'definitely', 'moments', 'just', 'cast', 'caliber', 'expected', 'more']",Animal Factory

Dafoe manages to make this character very human, and we root for him in whatever he gets involved in. The usual requirements for a prison movie are here: guards who look the other way, favoritism because of pay-offs, drugs, violence, racial tension and the sexual undercurrents.Decker's cellmate is a heavily made-up cross-dresser with muscles who when he is on screen steals the show.

It's certainly a great improvement over Tree's Lounge as far as production is concerned, and all the right elements - directing, dialogue, acting, cinematography - are in place, but the characters and plot are just not interesting enough to make it unique and memorable. There are tons of prison dramas out there; Animal Factory just isn't newsStill, for what it is, it's a great film and certainly worth your time. More realistic than most prison dramas tend to be, Animal Factory shows a picture of prison life that is much less shocking and brutal than we're used to see in this kind of film, and focuses more on the difficulties of actual day-to-day survival. The story focuses on young inmate Ron Decker (the very talented Edward Furlong, memorable as Edward Norton's younger brother in American History X) and tough guy Earl Copen (Willem Dafoe) and on the relationship forming between them. Nothing new, really, but with two excellent actors and some great, unpretentious directing we get a really lovely film. The rest of the excellent cast includes Chris Bauer, Danny Trejo, Tom Arnold, an unforgettable Mickey Rourke and Buscemi himself in a small part.A very slow and intimate movie, Animal Factory is not much of a masterpiece but it shows a lot of potential and promise for Steve Buscemi as a director.

I've always admired Dafoe as an actor and his roles are generally well-acted.  Animal Factory is not a good example of what a prison drama can be. The storyline is basic, but utimately leads nowhere.  Dafoe does an admirable job as Earl, the man with all the juice on the inside.  Earl has everyone in his hip pocket, including guards and inmates.  He basically calls the shots in the yard as well.  Edward Furlong plays Ron Decker, a spoiled rich kid who gets busted for possessing 200,000 dollars worth of marijuana.  The judge and the court system look to make an example of Decker, so he's sent to the animal factory.  Soon he makes good friends with Earl and finds protection behind the prison's walls.  Mickey Rourke plays Furlong's cell-mate, I forget his name but he's a drag queen and pretty damn funny and scary at the same time.  Rourke is only in Animal Factory for about ten minutes.  I haven't read the novel Animal Factory, but I can't imagine that it could be anymore trite or boring than this film.

Buscemi has actually done his share of it, but the movies that result tend to be minor affairs that get little distribution outside the arthouse scene. That's kind of depressing, especially when it comes to a movie like Animal Factory, with a wealth of acting talent and a script to back it up.Ron Decker (American History X's Edward Furlong) gets busted for selling dope, and under the strict new laws, is sent to prison for five years on a felony rap. Once in the joint, Decker gets to know Earl Copen (Willem Dafoe), a lifer who is, as Morgan Freeman's character calls himself in The Shawshank Redemption, ""the guy who knows how to get things."" Decker and Copen form an odd, complex relationship that's viewed by those outside the prison walls with some alarm.Furlong, Dafoe, and Danny Trejo, who plays Dafoe's best friend, are only the tip of the acting iceberg in this movie; a host of other fine actors have parts ranging from supporting to bit, including Buscemi himself, Mickey Rourke, John Heard, Tom Arnold, Larry Fessenden, Seymour Cassel, and a host of others; were there not so much focus on Furlong and Dafoe, this would have easily been billable as an ensemble-cast movie, and to an extent it plays like that anyway; there's too much of a main story here for a straight ensemble film, though. (Rourke, especially, is notable here, in his best performance since Angel Heart.) Either way you look at it, this is a strong movie chock full of good performances; the subject matter, and the rather jaundiced way of looking at it, may make some squeamish, but the caliber of the performances here should be enough to overcome that.
