It certainly had some of the problems that people claim this movie had - bombastic, over-the-top, melodramatic, with plenty of over-acting (Ralph Fiennes, as good as he is, is often guilty of that in spades). Yet that movie receives a lot of praise (it had a higher budget, but still) and this movie gets negative reviews.I really liked this movie. Not because it seeks to reorder our preconceived notions of cinematic narrative, or any such lofty, ambitious, goal, but because it's a throwback to the old days of larger-than-life, chewy 1940s escapist epics.Which is not to say it's the period piece equivalent of ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" The movie does have subtlety, very good acting, well-written characters, some beautiful shots and camera work (I'm not talking about outside Gilda's Paris apartment either), and some good messages. It also has all the requisites of a good epic to - a large, sweeping feel; love, loss, and death; great locations and scenery, grandoise, dramatic events in world history contrasted with changes in the lives of individuals, and so on.It totally succeeds on its merits. It's not trying to win an Oscar, it's meant to be an entertaining World War 2 epic, and for me, it most certainly is. For me, the strength of this movie is the acting by the three leads and the sharply written characters. I really liked this characters and cared about what happened to them, and thought Townsend, Cruz, and Theron did a great job making me care about them. Cruz and her character were particularly irresistible. Townsend's acting isn't inferior, he's simply given less to work with. Theron brings more humanity and makes a somewhat stock character (the libertine socialite in these type of movies is a fixture) less irritating than usual and gives her more twists.This movie is full of nice little touches. For example, when Cruz's character Mia is working as a nurse on the battle front in Spain, her face appears to be marked by a rash. Realistic for the time in unsanitary and exhausting conditions, and quite a contrast to the unrealistically glamorously made-up Nicole Kidman in the Civil War era movie Cold Mountain (she looks like she just stepped off a fashion runway).In conclusion, if you like period piece epics, this is definitely one to see.",5,An epic period piece propelled by good acting that I really enjoyed.,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,2396,"['kind', 'interesting', 'remember', 'when', 'English', 'Patient', 'came', 'won', 'ton', 'awards', 'everyone', 'loved', 'certainly', 'had', 'problems', 'people', 'claim', 'movie', 'had', 'bombastic', 'over-the-top', 'melodramatic', 'plenty', 'over-acting', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'as', 'good', 'often', 'guilty', 'spades', 'movie', 'lot', 'praise', 'had', 'higher', 'budget', 'still', 'movie', 'negative', 'reviews.I', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'Not', 'reorder', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'cinematic', 'narrative', 'such', 'lofty', 'ambitious', 'goal', 'throwback', 'old', 'days', 'larger-than-life', 'chewy', '1940s', 'escapist', 'epics.Which', 'not', 'say', 'period', 'piece', 'equivalent', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'movie', 'have', 'subtlety', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'well-written', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'camera', 'work', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'outside', 'Gilda', 'Paris', 'apartment', 'either', 'good', 'messages', 'also', 'requisites', 'good', 'epic', 'large', 'sweeping', 'feel', 'loss', 'death', 'great', 'locations', 'scenery', 'grandoise', 'dramatic', 'events', 'world', 'history', 'contrasted', 'changes', 'lives', 'individuals', 'so', 'on.It', 'totally', 'merits', 'not', 'trying', 'win', 'Oscar', 'meant', 'be', 'entertaining', 'World', 'War', '2', 'epic', 'most', 'certainly', 'strength', 'movie', 'acting', 'three', 'leads', 'sharply', 'written', 'characters', 'really', 'liked', 'characters', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'thought', 'Townsend', 'Cruz', 'Theron', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'care', 'Cruz', 'character', 'were', 'particularly', 'irresistible', 'Townsend', 'acting', ""n't"", 'inferior', 'simply', 'given', 'less', 'work', 'Theron', 'more', 'humanity', 'somewhat', 'stock', 'character', 'libertine', 'socialite', 'type', 'movies', 'fixture', 'less', 'irritating', 'usual', 'more', 'twists.This', 'movie', 'full', 'nice', 'little', 'touches', 'example', 'when', 'Cruz', 'character', 'Mia', 'working', 'nurse', 'battle', 'front', 'Spain', 'face', 'be', 'marked', 'rash', 'Realistic', 'time', 'unsanitary', 'exhausting', 'conditions', 'quite', 'contrast', 'unrealistically', 'glamorously', 'made-up', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'movie', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'just', 'stepped', 'off', 'fashion', 'runway', 'conclusion', 'like', 'period', 'piece', 'epics', 'definitely', 'one', 'see']",N/A

This movie begins with an improbable event (shy college student has his studies interrupted by beautiful woman seeking overnight shelter in his room), and it goes downhill from there.  Although Roger Ebert disagrees, I think Charlize Theron was terribly miscast as the heroine (?), Gilda.  Despite her Oscar win, I don't think she has the acting chops to carry off this kind of role.  She's not bad when the script requires ""bouncy,"" but as the going gets rougher, her performance becomes pretty much one-note.  Stuart Townshend is as boring as they come.  There is not one point in the film where he stands out.  The surprise for me was Penelope Cruz.  She should have been onscreen longer.Also, if one watches the ""making of"" featurette, you'll see why the street scenes look unreal:  They're fake!

870074,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006J27WE,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Writer and Director John Duigan has added to his cinematic stature with this recent film about the interrelated responses of three countries - England, France, Spain - to the early phases of WW II and in doing so gives some inadveryent insight into how the continent was so endangered by the little known bad boy Hitler in the years leading up to the horror of a second World War.The title seems very appropriate - taken from the quip of 'Head in the clouds, Feet on the ground' - as the lead character Gilda (a radiantly beautiful Charlize Theron) seems to float above all of the reality of warring struggles in 1933, focusing her life on paramours, expensive clothes, and 'dangerous liaisons' with a varied assortment of men, all the while keeping a firm stance on needs of her strangely disjointed life.  Indeed, the opening of the film finds Gilda in need of shelter from a night's fling with a Cambridge lover and she knocks on the door of a poor struggling Irish student Guy (Stuart Townsend), thus beginning a lasting affair that coasts through the entire story.Guy eventually follows Gilda to Paris where she is a popular photographer living with her gallerist, but also living with her lesbian lover Mia (Penelope Cruz).  Gilda, Guy, and Mia become a triptych and it is only the impact of the rise of fascism in Spain (Mia's home) that separates the m&eacute;nage a trois: idealistic Guy and compassionate Mia are off to fight Franco while Gilda is left behind to admit to the encroaching threat of Nazis in France and enter into her own version of involvement.How these three weather the war and resolve their varied degrees of complicity provides the film's finale.  The cast is strong, the settings are gorgeous (in all three countries) as captured by cinematographer Paul Sarossy, and the musical score by Terry Frewer introduces a potential talent for film composition (while borrowing heavily from French cabaret songs, symphonic music by Edward Elgar, and pieces of Francis Poulenc).  But the overall reason for enjoying this rather long film is the interplay of Theron, Townsend and Cruz in a variety of richly sensuous vignettes. Well worth watching.

Both of them lives the convulsed and fabulous thirties, where the Charleston and jazz sounds were emerging with particular emphasis. Her brief stage in Cambridge, allows her to meet a very special man, who eventually will become the love of her life.This unlimited happiness will be interrupted by the war, attending the call of the conscious, curiously. She as a nurse and he, as sensible human being feel that their happy state of life is not in harmony with a bleeding world; in the neighbor country Spain: The Civil War is a very hard reality to ignore it.

870078,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0006J27WE,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[6, 12]","""Head in the Clouds"" is a historical romance/drama, which takes place in Europe before and during WWII. Although it covers an extremely fascinating period in terms of world events, this thoroughly disagreeable film takes little advantage of the many interesting storyline possibilities that history offers. What I'd like to know is, whatever possessed director/screenwriter John Duigan to turn beautiful, gifted Charlize Theron into a grotesque caricature of herself. And how did he do it? Was he using voodoo? Sally Bowles she most definitely is not! (although Liza Minnelli gave a stellar performance in that role). There are even scenes where the incomparable Penelope Cruz looks preposterous, as the uncomfortable third wheel in a menage-a-threesome.Ms. Theron plays Gilda Besse, the narcissistic playgirl daughter of a wealthy American socialite, (a suicide), and a French champagne tycoon, who is somewhat mad. She warns a lover, who fantasizes about a possible future with her, along with their potential children, ""I have doomed genes!"" Gilda has worked as a photographer, a dancer and an actress in a Hollywood movie, but mostly she dabbles. She always appears to be vamping for a camera lens, even when there is no apparent camera. Her wardrobe is simply gorgeous though. Probably the best part of the movie is watching the innumerable costume changes - usually one per scene, but we get two-for-one when Penelope Cruz is around to model. Another high point is cinematographer Paul Sarossy's wonderful footage of Paris. The movie is almost worth renting just to look at the Paris cityscapes.Anyway, before Gilda went to live in gay Paree, where she was to lose any vestige of freshness she may still have had at age 23, she was in England - Cambridge to be exact. One night, she wandered tipsily into the university dormitory room of Guy Malyon, (Stuart Townsend). He is a Dublin-born student on scholarship, and the son of an Irish policeman. In real life, Townsend and Charlize are a couple, and I am sure they make a charming twosome. However, in this movie, there is zilch chemistry between them. He is a handsome, sincere, if somewhat naive young man, but certainly not mature or edgy enough for Gilda, who eats men alive. She is too busy posing to stir up much heat with anyone, anyway. Guy and Gilda meet, once again, at an extremely wild party on a country estate. They are intimate on a billiard table, and then Gilda bids him adieu. She is off to see the world. In one of her parting lines, she mentions Arabia. Hah!! Meanwhile, Guy become a teacher and social activist as fascism looms over Europe.Years pass and Guy cannot forget Gilda. The very thought of her sends his hormones off the charts. So when she contacts him once more and asks him to visit her in Paris - he's off in a flash to the City of Lights! He finds her with a variety of meaningless lovers, working at ""photography as art."" She remains unattainable, even as he holds her. I think Gilda is supposed to come across as carefree - but she is too studied and jaded to be the free-spirit type. The lovely Spanish Mia, (Cruz), was an exotic dancer until Miss Besse brought her home to stay. She now lives with Gilda and Gilda's current man-of-the-moment.Politics and war finally overtake Europe and ruin Gilda's plans, especially when both Guy and Mia depart to fight for Republican Spain. She is furious that the two are leaving. ""There will always be wars,"" she tells them, ""you need to get rid of the guilt."" To say anything more would be to spoil what plot there is. One gets the feel that because Gilda, as a teen, had her fortune told, and it wasn't a good one, she believes life is preordained. All is fate. Therefore she lives as much and as fast as she can before karma can overtake her.This is one of the rare occasions that I write, without qualification, don't bother with ""Head In The Clouds.""

It really surprised me how good it was, I didn't even think I'd like it. Anyway, Townsend plays Guy, a young student who falls in love with Gilda Besse (Therone) the day she rushes into his college dorm room. Gilda is a free spirit, who drifts from guy to guy and eventually ends up with Guy. After years apart and finally moving in together, along with a studying nurse Mia (Cruz). Mia and Gilda are movie lesbians basically, you've seen versions of them in ""Wild Things"" and other movies. Eventually, Mia and Guy leave to fight in the Spanish Civil War much to the dismay of Gilda who doesn't believe in war. Mia and Guy leave Gilda behind and she vows to herself never to see them again. One great scene ensues when Guy returns to France to see Gilda, when he spots her on the street they exchange a glance and she walks away. This scene is wonderful and very poetic. One thing this film should not be confused with is a ""war movie"". It's not a war movie, it's not even kind of a war movie. ""Head in the Clouds"" uses war as a plot point, but the movie is really a love story. It's like ""The Dreamers"" and ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" in which, war is an overtone to the movie. Charlize Theron is glamorous in this movie, she's really in true movie star mode. Stuart Townsend, who also appeared with Theron in ""Trapped"", is really good as Guy; the lovestruck soldier who is forced to make a lot of life changing decisions. Cruz is in one of her best performance as Mia. I am truly surprised this movie didn't recieve more publicity and better reviews than it did, because (as I've stated several times now) this is a fantastic movie. Seeing Theron naked was a plus too.GRADE: A-",5,A Great Movie,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,1888,"['Oscar', 'Winner', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Best', 'Actress', ""'Monster"", 'real-life', 'boyfriend', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'star', 'Head', 'Clouds', 'movie', 'few', 'people', 'know', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'Anyway', 'Townsend', 'Guy', 'young', 'student', 'who', 'love', 'Gilda', 'Besse', 'Therone', 'day', 'college', 'dorm', 'room', 'Gilda', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'drifts', 'guy', 'guy', 'eventually', 'up', 'Guy', 'years', 'apart', 'finally', 'moving', 'together', 'studying', 'nurse', 'Mia', 'Cruz', 'Mia', 'Gilda', 'are', 'movie', 'lesbians', 'basically', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'versions', 'Wild', 'Things', 'other', 'movies', 'Eventually', 'Mia', 'Guy', 'leave', 'fight', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'much', 'dismay', 'Gilda', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'war', 'Mia', 'Guy', 'leave', 'Gilda', 'behind', 'herself', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'One', 'great', 'scene', 'ensues', 'when', 'Guy', 'France', 'see', 'Gilda', 'when', 'spots', 'street', 'exchange', 'glance', 'away', 'scene', 'wonderful', 'very', 'poetic', 'One', 'thing', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'war', 'movie', 'not', 'war', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'kind', 'war', 'movie', 'Head', 'Clouds', 'war', 'plot', 'point', 'movie', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'Dreamers', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'war', 'overtone', 'movie', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'glamorous', 'movie', 'really', 'true', 'movie', 'star', 'mode', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'Theron', 'Trapped', 'really', 'good', 'Guy', 'lovestruck', 'soldier', 'who', 'forced', 'make', 'lot', 'life', 'changing', 'decisions', 'Cruz', 'one', 'best', 'performance', 'Mia', 'am', 'truly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'recieve', 'more', 'publicity', 'better', 'reviews', 'did', 'because', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'Seeing', 'Theron', 'naked', 'was', 'plus', 'too.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

The pre-war part is fun, seeing the affluent party & play.  The war part comes along and each character seems to find deeper reasons for living.  Australian director John Duigan directed one of my favorite little films, ""Lawn Dogs"" from 1997.  The cinematography here is excellent; costumes are breathtaking; the story is epic, if perhaps just a bit too long.  Charlize Theron is a talented actress & glamorous movie star.  With her Oscar for ""Monster"" and other excellent performances such as ""Sweet November"" with Keanu Reeves and the ""Italian Job"" with Donald Sutherland, we expect a high level of performance which she delivers here.  Socialite playgirl Gilda Besse offers Theron a variety of emotions and displays her promiscuous naughty side, her businesswoman side as she develops a photography business, artist, lover and shows her ultimately capable of duplicity for a good cause.  It is a varied and stunning performance that is riveting.  Irish actor Stuart Townsend who played Dorian Gray in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" with Sean Connery does an excellent job as Irish patriot Guy who is torn by his political devotion and his emotional hormonal torrid love affair with Gilda.  Thrown into the mix is dancer Mia played by Penelope Cruz.  Cruz is an interesting actress from Spain who has played opposite Tom Cruise in ""Vanilla Sky,"" in ""Gothika"" & recently in ""Sahara.""  As the third person in the love triangle, she performs with a depth & intensity that is full match for Theron & Townsend.  While this film did seem to take a bit too long to conclude, it was an excellent film from a story that developed and characters that changed, reflecting a world that was also in a state of flux and change.

870086,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0006J27WE,mirasreviews,"[16, 23]","""Head in the Clouds "" aspires to be an epic romance. It is in many ways a classic story of personal relationships set against sweeping social, political, and ideological upheaval. The story takes place over the course of 11 years, starting in 1933, when Guy (Stuart Townsend), a young Irishman studying at Cambridge University, has a brief affair with wealthy, libertine Gilda (Charlize Theron) and ending with the liberation of Paris in 1944. Unable to forget Gilda years later, Guy goes off to join her in Paris, where he finds a rival of sorts for Gilda's love in Mia (Penelope Cruz), a Spanish nursing student and burlesque dancer whom Gilda has befriended. Gilda has no use for wars and politics, believing that a person's obligation is to live life to the fullest, not to throw it away on some cause or other. In contrast, Guy and Mia are idealists and feel compelled to support the Republican forces in Spain as they watch the rise of fascism in Europe.Charlize Theron, Stuart Townsend, and Penelope Cruz certainly make an attractive trio. Their heyday in Paris has lots of atmosphere, and Theron's wardrobe is lovely. But ""Head in the Clouds"" seems much longer than it is, probably because it is full of extraneous scenes that make it longer than it needed to be and weaken the relationship between Guy and Gilda that is the story's impetus. Guy and Gilda's love is never quite believable, and I can't say exactly why, but it could be a simple lack of ""chemistry"". Writer and director John Guigan's intention was to make a moving, tragic, epic romance around some of the 20th century's greatest conflicts. In this case, ""epic"" means too long, and the romance seems contrived. Although it would essentially be asking Guigan to make a different film than he did, I could not help thinking, while watching ""Head in the Clouds"", that it would have been more interesting to explore the validity of Gilda's and Guy's conflicting personal creeds. Guy is an idealist who believes in a global community, that people can change the world for the better, and that he has an obligation to intervene wherever people are being persecuted. Gilda believes individuals have a responsibility to protect themselves and not squander any bit of life, which frequently means that she exercises ""judicious cowardice"" in all things political. Since the romance is unconvincing, ""Head in the Clouds"" might have benefitted from more ideological analysis.The DVD: ""The Making of Head in the Clouds"" (9 minutes) includes interviews with writer/director John Guigan, production designer Jonathan Lee, and actors Charlize Theron, Stuart Townsend, and Penelope Cruz, in which they speak generally about the story, characters, and the film's style.

It follows a rich heiress (Charlize Theron) who pretty much just wants to enjoy her privileged lifestyle and though she had many male admirers and lovers she finds herself falling for a man of somewhat lower station (Stuart Townsend), who aspires to fight in the Spanish Civil War and then in the French Resistance. Some might argue he's an idealist whereas she is a realist though the film supports the belief that we live in the same world and therefore need to defend it even if it is another country. Penelope Cruz plays a love interest and friend to Theron, longing to return to her Spanish homelands.There are prominent themes of fate, love, duty and doom. The lovers are definitely torn in their beliefs between love at all expenses and duty to an ideal.As of late I'm finding the WWII stories to be saturating the market but I did find the unattainable love story engaging. Pessimists will find it melodramatic.This picture won a number of Genie Awards. Memorable soundtrack, too.

I do not think, however, that the typical American audience is used to a film like this.  It is a period piece, set against the backdrop of pre-World War II, which shows the blossoming relationships between a self absorbed socialite (Theron), an Irish brooder (Townsend), and a Spanish idealist (Cruz).  They form an unlikely trio in which Gilda the socialite is the centerpiece.This movie has lots of potential, and it's not the acting that ruins it.  In fact I thought the acting was A+.  The story spent too much time focusing on the trivial and not enough time focusing on the richness that was the era.  I didn't mind the length of the film (2 hours plus), but it could have been filled more with character development and less with extraneous scenes and people.  I would have cared more for the lead characters if I was given more information about them.Still, I watched, partly because I wanted to see what Charlize Theron would do after her fantastic work in Monster, and partly because I had never seen Stuart Townsend in anything before.
