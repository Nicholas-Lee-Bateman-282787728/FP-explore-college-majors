1388920,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0047UJBN6,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Psychosis is a pretty strange horror film.  Well it's not really strange in that it makes little to no sense.  I mean, at least we understand what the situation is- a woman who's a writer is terrified because the house she's staying in is apparently haunted.  Of course that's not the only thing taking place here.  Apparently her husband (or fiance, whatever) likes to cheat on her during those infamous ""out of town business trips"".  Yeah... we know what that means.Meanwhile the woman remains at a countryside home and has numerous adventures of her own.  In one situation she finds herself wandering around through the woods only to come across two people going at it on the ground.  She freaks out but her husband assures her that that type of sexual behavior is perfectly normal in their country.  The man going at it with the chick actually becomes one of the main characters, and eventually the woman learns to accept him and understand that he's not so creepy after all after inviting him inside for dinner.Well throughout the film the woman tries to concentrate on her writing in a dark computer room, but she encounters plenty of distractions that involve hallucinations and apparitions (one of which is a little boy kicking a soccer ball around outside).  Eventually it becomes too much and the woman loses her mind.  Will anyone believe her though?  It should be noted that her acting is pretty good.The problem with the movie, and the reason I'm lowering the rating from a 5 to a 3, is because it's just not scary at all.  Nothing is.  It's not even really interesting either, but at least it tries to be on several occasions with the bloody bathtub, the man going at it with his floozy outside, the same man putting drugs in the writers stew during that overnight dinner I mention above, and of course, the husband who cheats around on his wife at fancy high dollar resorts.  The occasional visions of ghostly sightings is another highlight, but this aspect honestly wasn't used enough.  When ghosts were seen, it was treated like a normal everyday occurrence which, according to my interpretation, means the writers were going for something other than direct horror.  What it was I haven't a clue.Overall, it's alright but no great shakes.",3,not as bad as others will tell you... but no classic either,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,2255,"['Psychosis', 'pretty', 'strange', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'strange', 'little', 'sense', 'mean', 'least', 'understand', 'what', 'situation', 'is-', 'woman', 'who', 'writer', 'terrified', 'house', 'staying', 'apparently', 'haunted', 'course', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'taking', 'place', 'here', 'Apparently', 'husband', 'fiance', 'cheat', 'infamous', 'town', 'business', 'trips', 'Yeah', 'know', 'what', 'means.Meanwhile', 'woman', 'countryside', 'home', 'numerous', 'adventures', 'own', 'one', 'situation', 'wandering', 'around', 'woods', 'only', 'come', 'two', 'people', 'going', 'ground', 'out', 'husband', 'type', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'country', 'man', 'going', 'chick', 'actually', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'eventually', 'woman', 'accept', 'understand', 'not', 'so', 'creepy', 'inviting', 'inside', 'dinner.Well', 'film', 'woman', 'concentrate', 'writing', 'dark', 'computer', 'room', 'plenty', 'distractions', 'involve', 'hallucinations', 'apparitions', 'one', 'little', 'boy', 'kicking', 'soccer', 'ball', 'outside', 'Eventually', 'too', 'much', 'woman', 'mind', 'Will', 'anyone', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'reason', ""'m"", 'lowering', 'rating', '5', '3', 'just', 'not', 'scary', 'Nothing', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'interesting', 'least', 'be', 'several', 'occasions', 'bloody', 'bathtub', 'man', 'going', 'floozy', 'same', 'man', 'putting', 'drugs', 'writers', 'stew', 'overnight', 'dinner', 'mention', 'course', 'husband', 'who', 'around', 'wife', 'fancy', 'high', 'dollar', 'resorts', 'occasional', 'visions', 'ghostly', 'sightings', 'highlight', 'aspect', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'enough', 'When', 'ghosts', 'were', 'seen', 'was', 'treated', 'normal', 'everyday', 'occurrence', 'according', 'interpretation', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'something', 'other', 'direct', 'horror', 'What', 'was', 'have', ""n't"", 'clue.Overall', 'alright', 'great', 'shakes']",Psychosis

Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[11, 11]","Well, if you are looking for a horror-type film that is a break from the traditional film of this nature, look no further than this one. Charisma Carpenter plays a writer who has moved to a secluded house in the woods after suffering a mental breakdown. After arriving there, she begins to have visions of a mass murder that occurred in that area fifteen years earlier. Aside from Carpenter, the cast is not very well known, and the performances are not that good. Also, the film drags a bit as it tries to go too noir, opting for long pauses with no music or no action. But it ends up being one heck of a good story, and there is a decent bit of gore for the horror lovers. There is some suspense, too, for those who love a good mystery. One note of caution: if you are offended by a large amount of gratuitous sex/nudity, then this might not be the film for you, because it occurs all throughout the film, even at unexpected places.",3,Different.....But Effective,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,934,"['Well', 'are', 'looking', 'horror-type', 'film', 'break', 'traditional', 'film', 'nature', 'look', 'further', 'one', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'writer', 'who', 'moved', 'secluded', 'house', 'woods', 'suffering', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'arriving', 'there', 'have', 'visions', 'mass', 'murder', 'occurred', 'area', 'fifteen', 'years', 'earlier', 'Aside', 'Carpenter', 'cast', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'Also', 'film', 'bit', 'go', 'too', 'noir', 'opting', 'long', 'pauses', 'music', 'action', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'heck', 'good', 'story', 'decent', 'bit', 'gore', 'horror', 'lovers', 'suspense', 'too', 'who', 'love', 'good', 'mystery', 'One', 'note', 'caution', 'are', 'offended', 'large', 'amount', 'gratuitous', 'sex/nudity', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'film', 'film', 'even', 'unexpected', 'places']",Psychosis

I enjoy horror movies, even the bad ones. Some of the reviewers here list the movie as having gratuitous nudity. There are a couple of semi-quick scenes, but I was expecting much more based off of the reviews. The acting isn't great by any means. I wish I had rented this instead of buying this (i got the Instant Video version for my Kindle). I tend to buy movies instead of renting, due to having a toddler running around, I don't want to spend $4 for a 3 day rental and then not being able to finish it.

Take the beautiful Charisma Carpenter (who you won't see naked and will barely see in suggestive clothes--so those who expect more needn't rent) and put her in a slow moving movie that takes forever to develop while somehow leaving gaping holes and confusing scenes. Throw in strobe like flash backs to a pathetic mass murder that consumes the first 15 minutes of the film, some creepy pointless locals, an empty house and you got the idea. You're also subjected to foul language, some terrible slasher gore, a man's nearly erect fully visible hilbilly's doinker swinging in the wind, several naked men's butts, one or two naked women's butts, a brief glimpse of nip on an ugly hooker, a bizarre and unerotic sex party and you can see how this movie goes no where and entertains no one. The only horror in this movie is the script. It seems that the director thought the more confused you were the better job he'd done. It's a mess. Somehow Charisma acts her way above the rest of the rubble, but it's a train wreck and not worth even a glimpse in this direction.",1,"Wow, is this awful!",1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,1120,"['Slow', 'confusing', 'pointless', 'not', 'degree', 'suspense', 'Take', 'beautiful', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'naked', 'will', 'barely', 'see', 'suggestive', 'clothes', 'so', 'who', 'expect', 'more', 'need', ""n't"", 'rent', 'put', 'slow', 'moving', 'movie', 'forever', 'develop', 'somehow', 'leaving', 'gaping', 'holes', 'confusing', 'scenes', 'Throw', 'strobe', 'flash', 'backs', 'pathetic', 'mass', 'murder', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'creepy', 'pointless', 'locals', 'empty', 'house', 'got', 'idea', ""'re"", 'also', 'subjected', 'foul', 'language', 'terrible', 'slasher', 'gore', 'man', 'nearly', 'erect', 'fully', 'visible', 'hilbilly', 'doinker', 'swinging', 'wind', 'several', 'naked', 'men', 'butts', 'one', 'two', 'naked', 'women', 'butts', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'nip', 'ugly', 'hooker', 'bizarre', 'unerotic', 'sex', 'party', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'where', 'one', 'only', 'horror', 'movie', 'script', 'director', 'thought', 'more', 'confused', 'were', 'better', 'job', ""'d"", 'done', 'mess', 'Somehow', 'Charisma', 'way', 'rest', 'rubble', 'train', 'wreck', 'not', 'worth', 'even', 'glimpse', 'direction']",Psychosis
