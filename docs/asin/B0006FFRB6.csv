865495,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0006FFRB6,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[5, 7]","A wonderful documentary centered on a nomadic family in the Gobi Desert, and their herds of animals, mostly sheep, and the big woolly two-humped camels from the region. If other cultures interest you, then you will enjoy this film which shows life in the round felt and canvas ""gur"", a large tent-like structure that houses the entire family, with cooking facilities in the center, brightly colored painted wood and rugs, and generous hospitality to visitors. The young couple are a handsome pair, and the wife, Odgoo, has a lovely singing voice.It's a vivid picture of the harsh, arid landscape, with the snow capped Altay Mountains in the horizon, all beautifully photographed by filmmakers Byanbasurem Davaa and Luigi Falorni, earning them a nomination for Best Documentary Feature at the 2005 Academy Awards.The camels are fabulous, and the ""star"" of the film is an adorable white calf, abandoned by his mother after a very long and hard birth. A musician from a distant town is brought in to play for them, in a ritual that will make the mother care for her offspring, and it is a fantastic thing to witness. The last 30 minutes of this film are quite magical, and all of it is extremely educational.Some may find the pacing slow, but that is because it is being seen from the complex fast track the viewer is on, compared to the steady flow of nomadic existence, and perhaps they are expecting a ""movie"", and not a documentary, as that is not clearly specified in the packaging, other than National Geographic being named as part of production. The slowness of the film is actually part of the experience, where the people are without distractions, and are a part of the nature around them, reading the sky for storms, and understanding their animals in a profound way.Total running time is 87 minutes.",5,"""land of steppe and sky""",1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,1808,"['wonderful', 'documentary', 'centered', 'nomadic', 'family', 'Gobi', 'Desert', 'herds', 'animals', 'mostly', 'sheep', 'big', 'woolly', 'two-humped', 'camels', 'region', 'other', 'cultures', 'interest', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'life', 'round', 'felt', 'canvas', 'gur', 'large', 'tent-like', 'structure', 'houses', 'entire', 'family', 'cooking', 'facilities', 'center', 'brightly', 'colored', 'painted', 'wood', 'rugs', 'generous', 'hospitality', 'visitors', 'young', 'couple', 'are', 'handsome', 'pair', 'wife', 'Odgoo', 'lovely', 'singing', 'voice.It', 'vivid', 'picture', 'harsh', 'arid', 'landscape', 'snow', 'capped', 'Altay', 'Mountains', 'horizon', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'filmmakers', 'Byanbasurem', 'Davaa', 'Luigi', 'Falorni', 'earning', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Feature', '2005', 'Academy', 'Awards.The', 'camels', 'are', 'fabulous', 'star', 'film', 'adorable', 'white', 'calf', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'very', 'long', 'hard', 'birth', 'musician', 'distant', 'town', 'brought', 'play', 'ritual', 'will', 'make', 'mother', 'care', 'offspring', 'fantastic', 'thing', 'witness', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'magical', 'extremely', 'educational.Some', 'may', 'find', 'pacing', 'slow', 'being', 'seen', 'complex', 'fast', 'track', 'viewer', 'compared', 'steady', 'flow', 'nomadic', 'existence', 'perhaps', 'are', 'expecting', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'not', 'clearly', 'specified', 'packaging', 'other', 'National', 'Geographic', 'being', 'named', 'part', 'production', 'slowness', 'film', 'actually', 'part', 'experience', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'distractions', 'are', 'part', 'nature', 'reading', 'sky', 'storms', 'understanding', 'animals', 'profound', 'way.Total', 'running', 'time', '87', 'minutes']",The Story of the Weeping Camel

Directed by a Mongolian woman and an Italian man who met as students at a German film school and set in the Mongolian steppe, the plot is slight and the directing style is somewhat artless, yet the story is charming and interesting. After a difficult delivery, a mother camel refuses to nurse her young. The camel owners (nomadic Mongolian shepherds, living in a ger in the steppe) send their two children to the city in order to get a violinist to convince the camel, through music, to feed her baby.

865500,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0006FFRB6,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[6, 9]","After watching the first half of this rather slow docu-drama, I felt my eyelids growing heavy. There wasn't a lot of action to keep the viewer involved, and the story is told completely from a Mongolian perspective with no voice-over narration nor explanations as to why certain things are the way they are. And this is both a strength and a weakness of the film; its strength being a complete submersion into Mongolian life without any Americanized influence, while its weakness being the confusion some might feel when cultural things happen for reasons unknown.For those who want a fast-paced narrative, you're certainly not going to find it here. But if you hang in there, the last 20 minutes of the film will reward you beyond any expectations.If you're a lover of music, then you're in for a heart-rendering and absolutely phenomenal climax, too.The story is about a group of nomadic Mongolian sheep herders who one day discover that the last camel in their harem is about to give birth ...but all is not going well. The birth is long and painful for the mother, and human intervention is a must in order to save the colt. And as the colt emerges from the womb, it appears different: it's completely white. The mother rejects its offspring and refuses to allow it to suckle, thus threatening the colt with starvation.We watch as time and again the sheep herding family try to get the mother to nurse the newborn, but there seems no hope. The colt may die ...unless they can convince the music teacher of a nearby town to come and perform a special ceremony involving a Chinese violin. So off to the city go two young brothers, and convince the teacher to come and help the mother and colt bond through an incredible musical display.The one thing that struck me was how sound-oriented camels are. I had no idea, never having spent much time around these humpbacked giants. But the Mongolian natives, who've grown up for centuries with these beasts of burden, know much more about them than most outsiders could ever imagine.And, again, don't give up on the film. Watch it to its conclusion and you won't be disappointed.

Also, even the old women were literate, and the children were responsible and very self-reliant.There was an initial sadness in the relationship with a newborn camel and his mother, and there seemed to be a change in facial expressions at the end of the film in both of these wonderful creatures, as if they knew they were acting in a movie and they were taking their bows.This film had a lot to say, particularly about the sophistication of these people and their apparent innocence.

They had a very nonjudgmental eye which allowed us to look into the lives of this population.  The sad thing is that apparently nothing happens out there, and I am not one of the subscribers to the belief that just because your life is simple it is somehow great.  That said it is an important document to study the lives of those people who live in the Gobi Dessert, it just doesn't make for good cinema.  I was reminded of two other movies, ""Waiting for Happiness"" and ""The Fast Runner,"" both which took place in the middle of nowhere and taught us that once there there's nothing to see. On the other hand the recent Icelandic film ""Noi"" was able to get inside their character's head and deliver a satisfying experience for the viewer.  I was also quite confused when one of the elder members of the tribe criticized television as nothing more than ""glass images.""  Would he prefer everybody stare at the dessert all day every day.  I did it for an hour and a half tonight and I was ready to throw in the towel. I don't believe ""Glass Images"" are inherently evil and neither does he if he is willing to use his life as one of those glass images.  I'm sorry, but by making correct choices about what images you watch you can easily live a more stimulating and educational life than these people do.  Of course, not everybody in the tribe felt the same way as he, as in one scene we see a group of people huddled around a television.  So if the ultimate goal is to be like the Americans, then there is no reason for us to revere them.  This film did have a few bright spots.  The highlight of the film for me was when we were treated to the extraordinary footage of a white camel being born.  Also, this film served as a reminder to me just how many luxuries we have in this country, and that they don't always serve the common good.  I'm sure these people in the Gobi Dessert do not have to endure credit checks before they want a place to live and the possibility that their government is listening in on their cell phone conversation.

865504,AQ990HW13DP08,B0006FFRB6,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[7, 8]","Shot on location in the Gobi desert of Mongolia, this unlikely but fascinating film documents the lives of a four-generation family of herders who live together but all alone in tents. If we did not know this was planet earth, the landscape might lead us to believe it was the moon. Wind, sand, rocks, sun, and the distant horizon of mountains are about all the eye can see. Tragedy strikes when an albino camel is born and the mother refuses to have anything to do with it. She spits at her baby, kicks it, flees from it, and refuses to let it nurse. This is a heart-rending natural tragedy, but for the desert dwellers it is a looming economic disaster. After trying every trick of the trade to reconcile mother and baby, the great-grand-father advises that they must call for a musician to perform an ancient, traditional ritual to heal the camel. They do so by dispatching the two very young brothers Dude and Ugna, who ride their camels alone across the desert wastelands some 30 miles to the nearest town.

865505,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B0006FFRB6,David E. Levine,"[6, 7]","Other reviewers have done a superb job so I will not add a lengthy description. Briefly, a family of Mongolian nomads in the Gobi desert raise sheep and camels (the Asian two humped kind). When the mother of one colt has a very difficult birth, she rejects her beautiful white colt and refuses to suckle him. Although the family manages to give the colt basic sustinence by milking the mother and, in one instance, literally tying the mother in place and forcing her to suckle her colt, they are concerned that the colt will ultimately not survive. Therefore, they send their two young sons off to a distant village to find an expert musician, hoping that a musical ritual will reach the mother and get her to accept the colt.What is so moving is that the camels seem to have deep emotions. There are several poignant secnes including one in which the colt literally cries after his mother. There is another heart rending scene of a mother cuddling with her colt and then the camera pans to the white colt sitting off by himself. When there is a sandstorm, we see several camels huddled together for protection but the colt is a distance away, fending for himself.The family tries to bring the colt and mother together and then bring the colt under his mother to nurse but the mother keeps turning away and nudging the colt off with her leg. Finally they leave the two alone and the mother goes off with the colt trying to follow.By the way, there is an interesting substory in that the boys see modern conveniences in the village including televisions and computers. Of course, the younger one wants these. The title of the movie is apt since you can feel the emotions and empathize with the camels.

865506,A67NO0TFRCNK1,B0006FFRB6,Dr Tathata,"[34, 35]","I can see how this film might be difficult for modern westerners--technologically and culturally sophisticated, conditioned and adapted to the complexity and fast pace of an urban existance.But there was a time--before the migrations to Europe and to North America, that our ancestors lived very much like the people of the film, nomadic herders in the plains of central Asia. The spiritual crisis of modern people emerges out of our loss of awareness or memory of ""archaic realites"". We can no longer hear the echoes of the voices of the ancient ones. We tend to be vastly removed from the natural world, sheltered in our high rise condominiums, often times the only example of nature in our environment is a lap dog. It has not always been like this.The animals that these Mongolians herd, they used to hunt, thousands upon thousands of years ago. It was easier to domesticate them. The way of life of these herding people has proceeded, over the millennia, with very little change, although, the people in the film have aquired a cast iron stove, and the youngest of their clan seem transfixed by the lure of modern technology such as television and computer games. When the little child, Ugma, asks for a television, his grandfather warns him, ""You don't want to sit around and watch glass images all day. That wouldn't be good.""Instead, they care for their animals and for each other, in a manner seemingly unchanged since the dawn of time itself. When a new camel mother rejects her first born, following a difficult birth, it becomes a problem that only humans seem to understand. Only humans seem to be capable of providing an intervention. The other camels seem oblivious to the cries of the lonely, starving, abandoned, colt. But the humans know what to do. They have seen this before. They send for a tribal violinist. There was a time when one did not need to travel far to find one. But times have changed. Now one needs to take a day to ride a camel to the nearest cultural center, and ask the music teacher to come and help. But when he does, the humans gather around the new mother. then hang the violin from her hump. The wind gently invokes haunting soft echoes from its soundboard. Then the violin is removed and the musician begins to play. The human mother gently strokes the camels fur and sings softly to her. And the mother camel begins to weep. The little colt is brought forward, and begins to nurse. His mother accepts him. There is hope. There has been healing.This is a little bit of the ancient wisdom lost to modern people. These were among the things our ancestors once understood. That the place of humans in the pantheon of life is to be the agents of nature--good stewards, correcting things, fixing natures little mistakes, getting things back into a natural harmony. Who else has the intelligence to do this job?There is a primordial, raw, spiritual power to this story that is deeply, and profoundly touching. It is told in a minimalist fashion, and that ramps up the subtlety of feeling necessary to appreciate the moment of restoration, once it comes. You could say, in traditional terms, that the Mongolian shamans have manifested a ""metanoia"", a life transforming change of heart, for this camel. The power and beauty and purity of the moment seems to affect them all. Life is good. We are one heart.Psychologically speaking, we are all capable of armoring ourselves against the challenges of this cruel world to the point where we are no longer capable of feeling empathy, sympathy, mercy or compassion for ourselves or others. If only our doctors and priests had the simple, and singular knowledge possessed by these Mongolian herdsman. If only someone could play the violin for us, and stroke us, and sing to us, and melt the ice in which we find ourselves encased.

865507,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0006FFRB6,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","My only familiarity with this remote part of the world came from an interesting 2001 PBS special that Julia Roberts did on the horsemen of Mongolia's Gobi Desert. Apparently in their midst are nomadic families who raise sheep and camels for their daily livelihood. I have to admit it takes a while for this 2004 documentary to establish its purpose beyond its exotic setting, but once the drama begins to surface with a camel's rejection of her newborn baby, it becomes subtly, inextricably involving in spotlighting the true-life drama of the family's dilemma in trying to reconnect mother and child with the white calf's death the obvious outcome otherwise. Done in a way that reminds me of the fictionalized documentaries of Robert Flaherty I saw in college film class years ago (""Nanook of the North"" and ""Louisiana Story"" among others), co-directors Luigi Falorni and Byambasuren Davaa (himself a Mongolian) take a similar approach in restaging the drama for the camera.Indeed, like Flaherty's work, it all feels authentic and respectful of the locals' way of life. Living in clean, nicely decorated hut-like ""yerts"" on the scrub-filled plain, the four generations of the central family exist simply but with a strong sense of unspoken bonding and respect for the animals they raise. Rather than focusing on their isolation, the filmmakers show how the family is touched by the modern world, which crystallizes with the adventurous journey that the two boys, Dude and Ugna, take to a nearby village to retrieve a native musician to play a song of enlightenment to the mother camel.  In one of the more lighthearted episodes, with a sly nod to Yasujiro Ozu's ""Good Morning"", the younger one is particularly taken with the television sets he encounters.The scenes with the camels reflect the realism of a National Geographic special, no surprise since they are involved intimately in the production, with the birthing and the magical climax (which gives the film its title)  particularly affecting. Most surprising is how the filmmakers make the seemingly mundane activities of the family glow with an uncontrived sense of warmth and poignancy. Special mention needs to go to Falorni's masterful camerawork. While it doesn't attain the magical depth of Luc Jacquet's ""March of the Penguins"", probably because some of the staging does make itself self-evident, this one is still definitely worth viewing. Other than a photo gallery, there are really no extras with the DVD package.",4,"Music Soothes the Savage Beast in an Intriguing, Dramatized Documentary",1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,2483,"['only', 'familiarity', 'remote', 'part', 'world', 'came', 'interesting', '2001', 'PBS', 'special', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'did', 'horsemen', 'Mongolia', 'Gobi', 'Desert', 'Apparently', 'midst', 'are', 'nomadic', 'families', 'who', 'raise', 'sheep', 'camels', 'daily', 'livelihood', 'have', 'admit', 'while', '2004', 'documentary', 'establish', 'purpose', 'exotic', 'setting', 'once', 'drama', 'surface', 'camel', 'rejection', 'newborn', 'baby', 'subtly', 'inextricably', 'involving', 'spotlighting', 'true-life', 'drama', 'family', 'dilemma', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'mother', 'child', 'white', 'calf', 'death', 'obvious', 'outcome', 'otherwise', 'Done', 'way', 'fictionalized', 'documentaries', 'Robert', 'Flaherty', 'saw', 'college', 'film', 'class', 'years', 'ago', 'Nanook', 'North', 'Louisiana', 'Story', 'others', 'co-directors', 'Luigi', 'Falorni', 'Byambasuren', 'Davaa', 'Mongolian', 'take', 'similar', 'approach', 'restaging', 'drama', 'camera.Indeed', 'Flaherty', 'work', 'feels', 'authentic', 'respectful', 'locals', 'way', 'life', 'Living', 'clean', 'nicely', 'decorated', 'hut-like', 'yerts', 'scrub-filled', 'plain', 'four', 'generations', 'central', 'family', 'exist', 'simply', 'strong', 'sense', 'unspoken', 'bonding', 'respect', 'animals', 'raise', 'Rather', 'focusing', 'isolation', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'how', 'family', 'touched', 'modern', 'world', 'adventurous', 'journey', 'two', 'boys', 'Dude', 'Ugna', 'take', 'nearby', 'village', 'retrieve', 'native', 'musician', 'play', 'song', 'enlightenment', 'mother', 'camel', 'one', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'episodes', 'sly', 'nod', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'Good', 'Morning', 'younger', 'one', 'particularly', 'taken', 'television', 'scenes', 'camels', 'reflect', 'realism', 'National', 'Geographic', 'special', 'surprise', 'are', 'involved', 'intimately', 'production', 'birthing', 'magical', 'climax', 'film', 'title', 'particularly', 'affecting', 'Most', 'surprising', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'seemingly', 'mundane', 'activities', 'family', 'glow', 'uncontrived', 'sense', 'warmth', 'poignancy', 'Special', 'mention', 'needs', 'go', 'Falorni', 'masterful', 'camerawork', ""n't"", 'attain', 'magical', 'depth', 'Luc', 'Jacquet', 'March', 'Penguins', 'probably', 'staging', 'make', 'self-evident', 'one', 'still', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Other', 'photo', 'gallery', 'are', 'really', 'extras', 'DVD', 'package']",The Story of the Weeping Camel

I gathered my pre-teen daughters on the couch, preparing to share in a cultural experience with them.The cinematography is undeniably beautiful.  Considering the arid landscape and desert conditions, the filmmakers manage to create a setting of beauty and warmth, particularly within the Mongolian dwellings.  They imbue the characters with a quiet strength and dignity, while still showing a very human side (for example, the young boy's desire to have a TV set).On the downside, the movie spends a long time conveying a very thin story.  Baby camel is rejected by mother; Mongolians use musical balm to coax mother back into loving infant; everybody is happy.  This is an admirable idea, but it leaves us with no sense of urgency, suspense, or doubt.

How this film qualifies as ""Nordic"" I don't know (unless some of its investors were Nordic).This is a slow, thoughtful and beautiful film about tradition, the struggle to live with nature at his harshest and most demanding but also the struggle to live with ever-encroaching modernity. The story juxtaposes a traditional way of life with some of the modern conveniences people in cities possess (vehicles, televisions, video games). The film also shows graphic scenes of animals being born, which is something from which most modern people viewing the film are fairly far removed. In the story, a mother camel rejects her newborn baby and the family of herders who owns these camel works tirelessly to force the mother camel to accept her offspring. This is met with resistance (and watching the hopeful baby camel suffer this rejection repeatedly is heartbreaking). Finally the family must summon a musician from far away (sending their young boys alone to retrieve him), who will perform a particular song to induce the mother to accept her motherhood and begin to nurse her baby.

There are few family films that are so sweet and fascinating, while providing some understanding of what it is like to live in a forbidding environment, in this case, in a yurt with no television and few modern conveniences.  Although the film is mainly about life in the Gobi Desert, the plot concerns the family's anxiety over a new-born camel whose mother has rejected it and the efforts to get the camel to nurse her baby.  The children eventually go on a mission across the desert to a local town to ask a musician-healer to help them with the camel.  In the end, the mother camel does accept her baby, and this has more emotional impact than one might expect.  There is also a sense of irony at the end, because the documentary crew apparently bought a satellite dish for the family as payment for their participation.  The middle son had been yearning for TV (which he had seen in town), with the adults disapproving of the idea.  But at the end, we see the boys setting up the dish. Adult viewers may be sorry about that, but I suppose child viewers will approve of this choice.  There's a lot in this film to discuss with your children anyway!",5,A must-see family film--The Waltons in the Gobi Desert,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,1710,"['such', 'fabulous', 'family', 'film', 'conscientious', 'parents', 'should', 'watch', 'older', 'children', 'have', 'choose', 'subtitles', 'option', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'talking', 'film', 'film', 'amazing', 'experience', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'witness', 'life', 'extended', 'family', 'living', 'Yurts', 'animal', 'farming', 'Gobi', 'Desert', 'family', 'so', 'loving', 'children', 'like', 'children', 'everywhere', 'playing', 'games', 'helping', 'chores', 'children', 'are', 'sure', 'identify', 'children', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'family', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'sweet', 'fascinating', 'providing', 'understanding', 'what', 'live', 'forbidding', 'environment', 'case', 'yurt', 'television', 'few', 'modern', 'conveniences', 'film', 'mainly', 'life', 'Gobi', 'Desert', 'plot', 'family', 'anxiety', 'new-born', 'camel', 'mother', 'rejected', 'efforts', 'get', 'camel', 'nurse', 'baby', 'children', 'eventually', 'go', 'mission', 'desert', 'local', 'town', 'ask', 'musician-healer', 'help', 'camel', 'end', 'mother', 'camel', 'accept', 'baby', 'more', 'emotional', 'impact', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'also', 'sense', 'irony', 'end', 'documentary', 'crew', 'apparently', 'bought', 'satellite', 'dish', 'family', 'payment', 'participation', 'middle', 'son', 'had', 'been', 'yearning', 'TV', 'had', 'seen', 'town', 'adults', 'disapproving', 'idea', 'end', 'see', 'boys', 'setting', 'up', 'dish', 'Adult', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'sorry', 'suppose', 'child', 'viewers', 'will', 'approve', 'choice', 'lot', 'film', 'discuss', 'children', 'anyway']",The Story of the Weeping Camel

It'll completely subvert your expectations and work your heartstrings only when you're not paying attention.You want the best summation of ""The Story of the Weeping Camel,"" read the first Spotlight Review.  My friend had to twist my arm to watch this one, which irks me that he can now say to me, ""I told you so.""  This is one of those rare films in which methodical, deliberate pacing (and utmost respect for your documentary subject) pay off immensely.  These two grad students are going places.More of a docu-drama, this film finds a curious niche:  you know it can't all be real, yet you CANNOT FAKE a lot of what happens in it.  It walks the fine line between fact and fiction with admirable precision.  Once I found that niche at, say, the 15 minute mark, I was riveted.  Regardless of defying genre, it is incredibly well-made.  It's a filmic example of everything superfluous and consumerist in Western Society, maybe forcing you to rethink your entire life path or what it means to truly just live.It is quiet and respectful of all involved (and surprisingly funny), allowing the heartbreaking story of an unwanted, miscolored, white newborn camel colt to take center stage.  The title takes on multiple meanings during the Mother's extended labor, then once the runt begins trying to nurse.  I won't lie to you, the second and third acts of the film will bring you to tears.  And I know you think you're He-Man.  But listen to this child wail across the savannah for a mother that only rejects him, we'll see what you really are.Once the estranged relationship between Mother and Colt reaches the level of life-or-death, the sheparding family venture to the nearest settlement on the plain, which I believe is Russian.  There they must locate a violinist for a ritual which will reestablish the inherent maternal bond, otherwise the Colt's hope is lost.Simultaneously devastating and uplifting, viewers will be educated by the emotions the ""Weeping Camel"" elicits, and not manipulated by them.  This is a gifted film content to let culture tell the story.  Add to that the mesmerizing Gobi cinematography, and you've got yourself one of the best foreign films of 2004.Recommended to ALL.

865515,A37NODCIL8PP75,B0006FFRB6,"Jeannette Belliveau ""Author, Writer, Editor, ...","[2, 4]","There are still parts of the world where people life a pre-industrial life. And it is immensely challenging to bring film-making into these quiet, slow worlds, and let them be themselves without ""Indiana-Jones-ing"" them up.I've seen a few such areas, most notably, Indonesian Borneo. Daily life in Borneo's upcountry is usually pleasantly dull, as chickens scratch around, the women fan rice on mats to dry it, thunderstorms roll through, the sun dries the muddy paths, flowers riot into bloom, and it all starts over again the next day.Pastoral Mongolia partially fits the category, too, with its world revolving around camels and sheep rather than rice and bananas. What is absolutely amazing about ""Weeping Camel"" is how the filmmakers manage three things: To capture a slice of life in a traditional culture, to weave events into a narrative, and to have a resulting film enthrall while remaining true to the patient, deliberate pace of premodern life.The wants of children are at the center of the film. The baby camel wants milk. The mother camel wants a song, and the elders want to provide one, so that she is happy and produces milk, and her valuable and rare white baby will live.The child Ugna and his older brother (with the fabulous name of Dude) go unescorted on a trek to find the right musicians to cheer up the mother camel. It's a journey unimaginable in our dangerous modern world, but the children cover the great distance without problem (much like Alaska Native youth merrily explore and master their wilderness without helicopter parents).The baby camel has its needs, and Ugna finds he has needs too, or at least wants, when he sees his first TV in the town they visit. He has the eery maturity of the premodern child, seen in my young guide in Borneo, and in Alaska Native children, but he's a little kid like our own when dazzled by the delights of the idiot box.This film is a small treasure. Hopefully viewers who have not lived or visited firsthand traditional cultures will also make an effort to slow down, forget their impatience, and see what is lovely about the calmer world outside cities.

There was something poignant, deep and timeless in the old man's face, in the way he began telling the story. The camel of the Gobi desert is the astounding two-humped Bactrian camel, looking like a Tattouin creature from Star Wars with beautiful long golden-brown hair and intelligent moaning noises. I never tired looking at these guys. the family was filmed (in my view) with too much restraint, the filmmakers made it look like a portrait rather than a living breathing family.As for the film, it was obviously made by beginners who relied a bit too much on the visual imagery alone to tell the story. While this can be (and is) effective, at times there seemed to be a need for more editorial control or insight. For example, the roughness of the Gobi does not come across very well, we see very little of the desert apart from the space surrounding the yurt, and we get only a tiny glimpse of the elements (ie, sand storms).The Bon ritual depicted in the film was nice, if filmed a bit superficially and out of context; yet more powerful was the grandmother propitiation of the spirits of the 4 directions with offering of milk; great similarities with Siberian & Tuvan traditions here.All in all, an amateurish but enjoyable film.",3,i liked it,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1453,"['unremarkable', 'yet', 'own', 'way', 'powerful', 'touching', 'film.for', 'best', 'moment', 'was', 'very', 'beginning', 'old', 'guy', 'retying', 'rope', 'bundle', 'foraged', 'wood', 'camel', 'looked', 'making', 'was', 'something', 'poignant', 'deep', 'timeless', 'old', 'man', 'face', 'way', 'began', 'telling', 'story', 'camel', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'astounding', 'two-humped', 'Bactrian', 'camel', 'looking', 'Tattouin', 'creature', 'Star', 'Wars', 'beautiful', 'long', 'golden-brown', 'hair', 'intelligent', 'moaning', 'noises', 'never', 'tired', 'looking', 'guys', 'family', 'was', 'filmed', 'view', 'too', 'much', 'restraint', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'look', 'portrait', 'rather', 'living', 'breathing', 'family.As', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'beginners', 'who', 'relied', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'visual', 'imagery', 'alone', 'tell', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'effective', 'times', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'need', 'more', 'editorial', 'control', 'insight', 'example', 'roughness', 'Gobi', 'not', 'come', 'very', 'well', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'desert', 'apart', 'space', 'surrounding', 'yurt', 'get', 'only', 'tiny', 'glimpse', 'elements', 'ie', 'sand', 'storms', '.The', 'Bon', 'ritual', 'depicted', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'filmed', 'bit', 'superficially', 'context', 'yet', 'more', 'powerful', 'was', 'grandmother', 'propitiation', 'spirits', '4', 'directions', 'offering', 'milk', 'great', 'similarities', 'Siberian', 'Tuvan', 'traditions', 'here.All', 'amateurish', 'enjoyable', 'film']",The Story of the Weeping Camel
865518,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0006FFRB6,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[70, 76]","A visual impression of the environment in the southern Mongolian Gobi desert would be a sandy foreground with tall mountains in the far horizon topped with an endless blue sky.  Storms appear with short notice and without consideration of the people inhabiting the desert.  Populations in this remote location, where modern technology and monetary system do not apply, must find alternative means for continued existence.  Sheep farming and camel breeding are the main means of trade as the earth is too exhausted to farm.  The comfort of continual running water or electricity available from the flip of a switch is something of a fantasy.  Despite these hardships, the people of the Gobi desert remain in this harsh environment living by their ancient traditions, which the elderly pass down to younger generations.The Italian, Luigi Falorni, and Mongolian, Byambasuren Davaa, filmmaker with German film background ventured to the unsympathetic land of the Gobi desert where they intended to capture the truth of the people living in this sandy place.  The two filmmakers began their shooting in the spring, after the severe winter, as they decided on capturing the life of a family consisting of four different generations living together in a couple of tent-like structures.  Daily chores around their home are being immortalized by the camera, which depicts a life style with very little external stimuli.  All members of the family tend to the sheep and camels, as children are taught from an early age to help with the chores.  Several situations display the family members' awareness of nature's phenomenon, as they have to handle camel births and prepare for stormy weather.Unintentionally, Falorni and Davaa stumble upon a spectacular story, which they were fortunate to transmit to the world through their documentary.  The story within the documentary begins at the end of a camel birthing season when one of the camels, Ingen Temee, rejects its white offspring, Botok, after a two day long labor.  Images of other camels embracing their young colts pass on the affectionate nature of the camels, which increases the emotional pain depicted as Ingen Temee rejects Botok.  The little white colt is in constant hunger as the mother refuses to let him feed, which will cause much sadness among the viewers.  However, to the people of Gobi desert the camel has more than affectionate value.  The value of the camel is illustrated the use of the camel, as the camel provides transportation, milk, rope, and even toys for children.  In essence, the camel is a means of survival.  In order to prevent the young colt from dying the family decides to send Dude, a young teen, and his much younger brother, Ugna, on a 50 kilometer journey on camel to return with a violinist in order to hold a old traditional ceremony.The journey for the violinist turns out to be an eye-boggling adventure for Ugna, as he discovers the wonders of television.  Ugna cannot take his eyes off this square piece of technology that he discovered at some close neighbors home, a days camel ride away.  When the two brothers continue to their destination Ugna asks Dude what a television would cost. Dude responds, ""about 50 sheep, but then you would also need electricity.""  This displays the authenticity of the story and the value system by which they live.Eventually the two boys return from their long journey, which leads the viewers to one of the most amazing events in history where the power of music will carry over to another species.  This leaves the viewer wondering over the scientific approach to the world.  However, it also brings a warm and poignant feeling that remains within the audience long after the film is over.The Story of the Weeping Camel is in some aspects a dreary cinematic experience, but it has to be slow and monotonous compared to western living.  As mentioned before, very little external stimuli is provided to the people in the film.  The only means of communication with the outside world is a battery-operated radio, which does not work through most of the film, as they do not have batteries.  In the stillness and the seemingly endless desert the audience will experience a truly genuine culture.  This culture sheds some light on our high-technological society, as it probably will make most of the viewers feel a little embarrassed about our daily complaints when the cable does not work, or if electricity is accidentally shut off.",5,The Harsh Reality of the Gobi Desert with Poignant Solution,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,4457,"['visual', 'impression', 'environment', 'southern', 'Mongolian', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'would', 'be', 'sandy', 'foreground', 'tall', 'mountains', 'far', 'horizon', 'topped', 'endless', 'blue', 'sky', 'Storms', 'appear', 'short', 'notice', 'consideration', 'people', 'inhabiting', 'desert', 'Populations', 'remote', 'location', 'where', 'modern', 'technology', 'monetary', 'system', 'do', 'not', 'apply', 'must', 'find', 'alternative', 'means', 'continued', 'existence', 'Sheep', 'farming', 'camel', 'breeding', 'are', 'main', 'means', 'trade', 'earth', 'too', 'exhausted', 'farm', 'comfort', 'continual', 'running', 'water', 'electricity', 'available', 'flip', 'switch', 'something', 'fantasy', 'hardships', 'people', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'remain', 'harsh', 'environment', 'living', 'ancient', 'traditions', 'elderly', 'pass', 'down', 'younger', 'generations.The', 'Italian', 'Luigi', 'Falorni', 'Mongolian', 'Byambasuren', 'Davaa', 'filmmaker', 'German', 'film', 'background', 'ventured', 'unsympathetic', 'land', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'where', 'intended', 'capture', 'truth', 'people', 'living', 'sandy', 'place', 'two', 'filmmakers', 'began', 'shooting', 'spring', 'severe', 'winter', 'decided', 'capturing', 'life', 'family', 'consisting', 'four', 'different', 'generations', 'living', 'together', 'couple', 'tent-like', 'structures', 'Daily', 'chores', 'home', 'are', 'being', 'immortalized', 'camera', 'life', 'style', 'very', 'little', 'external', 'stimuli', 'members', 'family', 'tend', 'sheep', 'camels', 'children', 'are', 'taught', 'early', 'age', 'help', 'chores', 'Several', 'situations', 'display', 'family', 'members', 'awareness', 'nature', 'phenomenon', 'have', 'handle', 'camel', 'births', 'prepare', 'stormy', 'weather.Unintentionally', 'Falorni', 'Davaa', 'stumble', 'spectacular', 'story', 'were', 'fortunate', 'transmit', 'world', 'documentary', 'story', 'documentary', 'begins', 'end', 'camel', 'birthing', 'season', 'when', 'one', 'camels', 'Ingen', 'Temee', 'white', 'offspring', 'Botok', 'two', 'day', 'long', 'labor', 'Images', 'other', 'camels', 'embracing', 'young', 'colts', 'pass', 'affectionate', 'nature', 'camels', 'emotional', 'pain', 'depicted', 'Ingen', 'Temee', 'Botok', 'little', 'white', 'colt', 'constant', 'hunger', 'mother', 'let', 'feed', 'will', 'cause', 'much', 'sadness', 'viewers', 'However', 'people', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'camel', 'more', 'affectionate', 'value', 'value', 'camel', 'illustrated', 'use', 'camel', 'camel', 'transportation', 'milk', 'rope', 'even', 'toys', 'children', 'essence', 'camel', 'means', 'survival', 'order', 'prevent', 'young', 'colt', 'dying', 'family', 'send', 'Dude', 'young', 'teen', 'much', 'younger', 'brother', 'Ugna', '50', 'kilometer', 'journey', 'camel', 'return', 'violinist', 'order', 'hold', 'old', 'traditional', 'ceremony.The', 'journey', 'violinist', 'out', 'be', 'eye-boggling', 'adventure', 'Ugna', 'wonders', 'television', 'Ugna', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'square', 'piece', 'technology', 'discovered', 'close', 'neighbors', 'home', 'days', 'camel', 'ride', 'away', 'When', 'two', 'brothers', 'continue', 'destination', 'Ugna', 'Dude', 'what', 'television', 'would', 'cost', 'Dude', '50', 'sheep', 'then', 'would', 'also', 'need', 'electricity', 'authenticity', 'story', 'value', 'system', 'live.Eventually', 'two', 'boys', 'return', 'long', 'journey', 'viewers', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'events', 'history', 'where', 'power', 'music', 'will', 'carry', 'species', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'scientific', 'approach', 'world', 'However', 'also', 'warm', 'poignant', 'feeling', 'audience', 'long', 'film', 'over.The', 'Story', 'Weeping', 'Camel', 'aspects', 'dreary', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'be', 'slow', 'monotonous', 'compared', 'western', 'living', 'mentioned', 'very', 'little', 'external', 'stimuli', 'provided', 'people', 'film', 'only', 'communication', 'outside', 'world', 'battery-operated', 'radio', 'not', 'work', 'most', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'batteries', 'stillness', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'desert', 'audience', 'will', 'experience', 'truly', 'genuine', 'culture', 'culture', 'light', 'high-technological', 'society', 'probably', 'will', 'make', 'most', 'viewers', 'feel', 'little', 'embarrassed', 'daily', 'complaints', 'when', 'cable', 'not', 'work', 'electricity', 'accidentally', 'shut', 'off']",The Story of the Weeping Camel
865519,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0006FFRB6,Linda Linguvic,"[171, 179]","Two German filmmakers went to Mongolia's Gobi desert to make a documentary.  Here, they got to know one particular family and witnessed a real story that was unfolding in front of their eyes.  They filmed it all.  And this film is the result.The family is real. The little girl cries for her mother but quiets when her grandmother gives her a sweet.  The two boys act like children everywhere, wide eyed with wonder and wanting to help out their family.  The parents are loving.  The grandparents are wise.  They raise camels and sheep for a living and have been doing so for hundreds of years.  There is plenty of food and they seem to have all the things they need even though they live without electricity and just a battery-operated radio to connect them to the outside world. Of course the modern world is influencing them.  The little girl wears a sweatshirt with silk-screening on it.  The little boy keeps asking for a television set.The central story, however, is about a camel.  Yes, a camel.  It's the birthing season and we watch a camel giving birth and then bonding with her young.  That's the way it's supposed to be.  Another mama camel, however, has a difficult birth.  The little one is coming feet first and the mama camel is in a lot of distress.  The family watches this all and tries to help, but basically, the mama camel does it all on her own.  Then, instead of the instant bonding that we've already seen among other camels, this mama camel rejects her little one.  The family tries everything to try to make her feed her baby, but she just pushes the little camel away.  Days go by and even though the family tries to feed the baby camel, they know that the little one will die if he doesn't get his mother's milk in quantity.The two young boys, who are probably about 7 and 13 are sent on a journey to bring back a musician who will play sacred music.  The family believes that this might make the mother camel receptive to the baby camel.  It's quite a long trip and looked dangerous even though I knew that there was a film crew along filming the whole thing.  The settlement is Russian and there is a school and some stores and a market.  Most of all though, there is television.  The boys are fascinated.Soon they return.  And the musician comes too.  And of course there is a happy ending.Along the way, though, I felt I was picked up and gently placed down in a culture on the other side of the world.  I absorbed the details of their lives.  Stressed with them over their problem with the camel.  And really cared for them all, including the camel.I highly recommend this film for everyone.

This story captured by student film makers was a lucky break for them - - and for all viewers. Four generations of a family are shown in their primitive setting. They lead a semi-nomadic life with the backdrop of impressive mountains & vast stretches of the bleak Gobi desert, raising sheep and camels.The two young boys, Dude and Ugna, help train the camels & do other chores rising from water & heating needs. A battery radio is their one contact with the wider world but batteries can go dead. The radio didn't alert them to a terrific windstorm that left their yurt, a circular domed tent-home, coated with sand.The birthing season is a primary focus of the film. All goes well until one mother camel has an extremely difficult breech birth and rejects her rare white baby. The family works with her & the colt to assure the success of his nursing, and viewers are caught up in the family's anxieties for its welfare.A decision must be made & the two boys are sent a day's journey away to the nearest settlement for help. Ugna is almost too small to mount a camel but he has a winning determination. The boys contact a music teacher who follows them home on a cycle! He performs a singing ritual that has elements of massage, almost hypnotic singing, and the playing of a string instrument..This healing ceremony has many of the family & neighbors witnessing; it is indeed impressive.

There was hardly any dialogue. The ""violence"" (I've never heard the birth process being described as violence before, but still) was over within the first ten minutes. And otherwise: - well, ""none"" is pretty fair.Now usually, I'm quite game for this sort of thing: Slow moving I can do (Tarkovsky's Solaris: check); German expressionism I can do (Werner Herzog: seen them all); moody nature/wilderness films set in Mongolia I can do (Dersu Uzala: check). The Mongolian hinterland fascinates me. But, all the same, this one had me snookered.I mean, what is it? A documentary or a scripted feature? It seems to be a documentary, but it doesn't feel like one. (How did the German film crew know there was going to be a Rejected White Baby Camel ahead of time? What did the Mongolians make of the German film crew? Now *that* would have made for an interesting documentary.) Are we expected to believe that a bunch of guys from Munich with a steady-cam were just loafing around in Ulan Batoor and happened to catch this by chance? Was the Rejected White Baby Camel narrative a happy coincidence during a routine documentary they happened to be making about a family living a fairly boring life in the middle of nowhere? (Sample dialogue - ""I think the last colt will not now be born today."" ""No. Perhaps Tomorrow."" and ""Come on! hurry up! Let's go!"". But let's go *where*? You're in the middle of the Gobi Desert. Where is there to go? What's the hurry?). What on earth possessed them to go to Mongolia to make a film like that?On the other hand, if it's a dramatic feature, where is the drama? The Mongolian family seems to be a well adjusted, harmonious, thoughtful, nice bunch of people (and they've called one of their kids DUDE!) But that's the problem: (perhaps out of some sort of cross-cultural respect) the film makers can't bring themselves to suggest any sort of imbalance in the family's way of life (apart from a grumpy camel). They feed the Rejected White Baby Camel by hand. They earnestly summon some sort of priest who lights some candles, make model camels out of clay and starts singing to them, I suppose on the off chance that this might help. But all the while the poor Rejected White Baby Camel is in reasonably caring hands (perhaps misguided from the point of view of animal husbandry).So, other than to satisfy a vaguely voyeuristic need to see foreign people behaving eccentrically, what do we learn from this? The film never conveys the sense of scope to be a tragedy. The Rejected White Baby Camel is going to be okay. We are confident of that throughout.So much so that by 40 minutes I had already started leafing through a magazine. Shortly afterwards the wife and I looked at each other, decided we'd seen enough, that we were happy enough to leave the Rejected White Baby Camel in the caring hands of these Mongolian folk: that it would pull through.

One of the camels rejects her offspring and we watch spellbound as the baby repeatedly attempts to bond with its mother. After numerous rejections, the baby seems to accept the rejection and relies on the humans for its survival.  The elders of the tribe seek the help of a violinist to perform a magical ceremony to repair the bond between mother and baby. The film captures this transformation and we sit transfixed as we watch the mother camel, transformed by the music, breaking into copious tears, and into accepting her baby.

Drastic measures are called for, and Buddhist monks and an outside music teacher are brought in for a healing ceremony.  Originally filmed as a documentary, the footage of the camels birthing is amazing.Beautifully filmed, with lush, vibrant colors that highlight the monochromatic Gobi Desert, and that captures the daily exotic rhythm of life in rural Mongolia with a simple beauty.

865532,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0006FFRB6,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 1]","Although it definately has a plot, ""The Story Of The Weeping Camel"" is in many ways a slice-of-life movie - life in Mongolia's Gobi desert, where nomads raise camels for their wool - and is in fact possibly the best 'slice-of-life' movie ever made.  It fully captures a very different part of the world and the lifestyles and people within it.For the central family, which moves from feeding ground to feeding ground with their camels, setting up colorful yerts which serve as their domiciles, a crisis arises when a female camel gives birth to a young calf which she rejects, refusing to nurse.  Without its mother's care, the young camel will die, and the family's efforts to coax the mother are unsuccessful.  The concern of the family for the calf seems motivated by more than a concern for the calf's economic value.  The nomads seem to view the camels as part of their extended group, and this bond goes a long way to making the movie.  Wanting to save the calf any way they can, they fall back on an old legend and several members of the family set off across the Gobi toward a small city where they hope to find a kind of shaman who, it is said, can sing to camels in a way that can heal their spirits.  The hope is that this will encourage the mother to accept her newborn.  Inside the city, which is fairly modern, the young nomads find it utterly alien and a bit intimidating.  The little boy who's journeyed there is the least intimidated and the most curious.  In one of the movie's many charming side plots, the little guy discovers something he'd never dreamed of before, and becomes utterly fascinated by: cartoons playing on the tvs set up at the open air marketplace.They find what they're looking for and head back towards home, hoping it's not too late.  Throughout the whole film, it's just visually beautiful: the desert, the colorful culture of the nomads, the magnificent animals they live in a kind of symbiosis with, even the congested city.  Excellent characterization and a real sense of magic and love are also among the movie's highpoints.  A lot of people seeing the general description of the movie - 'family of nomads tries to convince camel to accept its newborn calf' - would probably skip right over it, but I really think this could be appreciated by a much larger audience if people took a chance on it.  This is one of the movies I recommend to people every chance I get, and I'll do so again here.",5,One-Of-A-Kind Magical Movie In The Gobi Desert,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,2437,"['definately', 'plot', 'Story', 'Weeping', 'Camel', 'many', 'ways', 'slice-of-life', 'movie', 'life', 'Mongolia', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'where', 'nomads', 'raise', 'camels', 'wool', 'fact', 'possibly', 'best', ""'slice-of-life"", 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'fully', 'very', 'different', 'part', 'world', 'lifestyles', 'people', 'it.For', 'central', 'family', 'feeding', 'ground', 'feeding', 'ground', 'camels', 'setting', 'up', 'colorful', 'yerts', 'serve', 'domiciles', 'crisis', 'when', 'female', 'camel', 'birth', 'young', 'calf', 'refusing', 'nurse', 'mother', 'care', 'young', 'camel', 'will', 'die', 'family', 'efforts', 'coax', 'mother', 'are', 'unsuccessful', 'concern', 'family', 'calf', 'motivated', 'more', 'concern', 'calf', 'economic', 'value', 'nomads', 'seem', 'view', 'camels', 'part', 'extended', 'group', 'bond', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'movie', 'Wanting', 'save', 'calf', 'way', 'can', 'fall', 'back', 'old', 'legend', 'several', 'members', 'family', 'set', 'off', 'Gobi', 'small', 'city', 'where', 'hope', 'find', 'kind', 'shaman', 'who', 'said', 'can', 'sing', 'camels', 'way', 'can', 'heal', 'spirits', 'hope', 'will', 'encourage', 'mother', 'accept', 'newborn', 'city', 'fairly', 'modern', 'young', 'nomads', 'find', 'utterly', 'alien', 'bit', 'intimidating', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'journeyed', 'least', 'intimidated', 'most', 'curious', 'one', 'movie', 'many', 'charming', 'side', 'plots', 'little', 'guy', 'discovers', 'something', ""'d"", 'never', 'dreamed', 'before', 'utterly', 'fascinated', 'cartoons', 'playing', 'tvs', 'set', 'up', 'open', 'air', 'marketplace.They', 'find', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'head', 'back', 'towards', 'home', 'hoping', 'not', 'too', 'late', 'whole', 'film', 'just', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'desert', 'colorful', 'culture', 'nomads', 'magnificent', 'animals', 'live', 'kind', 'symbiosis', 'even', 'congested', 'city', 'Excellent', 'characterization', 'real', 'sense', 'magic', 'love', 'are', 'also', 'movie', 'highpoints', 'lot', 'people', 'seeing', 'general', 'description', 'movie', ""'family"", 'nomads', 'tries', 'convince', 'camel', 'accept', 'newborn', 'calf', 'would', 'probably', 'skip', 'right', 'really', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'appreciated', 'much', 'larger', 'audience', 'people', 'took', 'chance', 'one', 'movies', 'recommend', 'people', 'chance', 'get', ""'ll"", 'do', 'so', 'again', 'here']",The Story of the Weeping Camel
865533,A1XOHJLA16DPZT,B0006FFRB6,Steve Koss,"[3, 18]","THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL portrays the life and livelihoods of a small group of camel herders on the barren wastes of the Mongolian plain. The movie focuses on the rejection of a snow white, newborn camel colt by its mother, the family's futile efforts to bond the mother to her colt, and their ultimate resort to an ancient ritual involving a violin-accompanied chant. If the ritual succeeds, the mother camel is believed to weep in accepting her newborn and allowing it to drink her milk.Around this simple premise, the directors Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi Falorni build a documentary-style exploration of a simple and vanishing way of life: closeness to Nature, interdependency of family members, resourcefulness in the face of limited resources, finding pleasure in small things. At the same time, modern life encroaches as the family's two young boys set out on camels for the nearest large town to retrieve the music teacher for the camel bonding ceremony (and also buy some D-cell batteries for their grandfather's radio). On their trek, we see them fascinated by television, bicycles, computer games, and ice cream cones. We also see children adorned with Nike and Adidas labels, further harbingers of impending change and reminders of the endless reach of global brands.The cinematic approach here is documentary, yet parts are clearly staged. The result is an odd mixture of realism and story-telling. The documentary moments feel honest and observant, but the plotted moments often feel contrived. The directors go overboard linking the camel's rejection of her colt to the Mongolian mother's caring for her little girl, pairing those scenes so closely that they nearly slap you in the face, even at the closing scenes. The boys' interest in getting a television and their father's easy acceptance of their request (ending with the boys trying to position a satellite dish) is another instance where a different story-telling motivation nearly overwhelms the original one.The directors have made an odd choice in this film, presenting a family tale without introducing the family members. Aside from the little girl, Guntee, and the two young boys, Dude (doo-duh) and Ugna, we never learn the names of the family members until they are ""presented"" at the closing credits. We don't even learn until the end that the mother and baby camel have names. This decision creates an unnecessary sense of distance from an otherwise intimate story.Viewers can approach this movie as a National Geographic animal story, a tale about the power of folk customs and the magic of tribal music, a view of the nomadic herdsmen's life on the austere Mongolian plains, or a cautionary story about the encroachment of Western brands and technologies on the simple life of the ""noble savage."" The movie's strength is that it can be seen in so many different lights at the same time, yet that also leads to the movie's greatest weakness - its inability to execute any one of those story lines fully and convincingly.THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL is told without adornment or special effects. The pacing is slow and deliberate, undoubtedly a mirror of Mongolian camel herding life, but I found my attention wandering at times. The story line is short on human drama, and even the animal drama is minimized by the size of the family's sheep and camel herds and their hand-milking of the mother camel and hand-feeding of her colt. Neither the family's well-being nor the baby camel's survival ever seems at issue.In sum, this is a moderately interesting examination of Mongolian life and traditions. Although it is simply and directly told, THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL regrettably also demonstrates that less is not always more. Sometimes, it really is just less.",3,A So-So Documentary Packaged in a So-So Drama,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,3758,"['STORY', 'THE', 'WEEPING', 'CAMEL', 'life', 'livelihoods', 'small', 'group', 'camel', 'herders', 'barren', 'Mongolian', 'plain', 'movie', 'rejection', 'snow', 'white', 'newborn', 'camel', 'colt', 'mother', 'family', 'futile', 'efforts', 'bond', 'mother', 'colt', 'ultimate', 'resort', 'ancient', 'ritual', 'involving', 'violin-accompanied', 'chant', 'ritual', 'mother', 'camel', 'believed', 'weep', 'accepting', 'newborn', 'allowing', 'drink', 'milk.Around', 'simple', 'premise', 'directors', 'Byambasuren', 'Davaa', 'Luigi', 'Falorni', 'build', 'documentary-style', 'exploration', 'simple', 'vanishing', 'way', 'life', 'closeness', 'Nature', 'interdependency', 'family', 'members', 'resourcefulness', 'face', 'limited', 'resources', 'finding', 'pleasure', 'small', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'modern', 'life', 'encroaches', 'family', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'set', 'out', 'camels', 'nearest', 'large', 'town', 'retrieve', 'music', 'teacher', 'camel', 'bonding', 'ceremony', 'also', 'buy', 'D-cell', 'batteries', 'grandfather', 'radio', 'trek', 'see', 'fascinated', 'television', 'bicycles', 'computer', 'games', 'ice', 'cream', 'cones', 'also', 'see', 'children', 'adorned', 'Nike', 'Adidas', 'labels', 'further', 'harbingers', 'impending', 'change', 'reminders', 'endless', 'reach', 'global', 'brands.The', 'cinematic', 'approach', 'here', 'documentary', 'yet', 'parts', 'are', 'clearly', 'staged', 'result', 'odd', 'mixture', 'realism', 'story-telling', 'documentary', 'moments', 'feel', 'honest', 'observant', 'plotted', 'moments', 'often', 'feel', 'contrived', 'directors', 'go', 'overboard', 'linking', 'camel', 'rejection', 'colt', 'Mongolian', 'mother', 'caring', 'little', 'girl', 'pairing', 'scenes', 'so', 'closely', 'nearly', 'slap', 'face', 'even', 'closing', 'scenes', 'boys', 'interest', 'getting', 'television', 'father', 'easy', 'acceptance', 'request', 'ending', 'boys', 'trying', 'position', 'satellite', 'dish', 'instance', 'where', 'different', 'story-telling', 'motivation', 'nearly', 'overwhelms', 'original', 'one.The', 'directors', 'have', 'made', 'odd', 'choice', 'film', 'presenting', 'family', 'tale', 'introducing', 'family', 'members', 'Aside', 'little', 'girl', 'Guntee', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'Dude', 'doo-duh', 'Ugna', 'never', 'learn', 'names', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'presented', 'closing', 'credits', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'learn', 'end', 'mother', 'baby', 'camel', 'have', 'names', 'decision', 'unnecessary', 'sense', 'distance', 'otherwise', 'intimate', 'story.Viewers', 'can', 'approach', 'movie', 'National', 'Geographic', 'animal', 'story', 'tale', 'power', 'folk', 'customs', 'magic', 'tribal', 'music', 'view', 'nomadic', 'herdsmen', 'life', 'austere', 'Mongolian', 'plains', 'cautionary', 'story', 'encroachment', 'Western', 'brands', 'technologies', 'simple', 'life', 'noble', 'savage', 'movie', 'strength', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'lights', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'movie', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'inability', 'execute', 'one', 'story', 'lines', 'fully', 'convincingly.THE', 'STORY', 'THE', 'WEEPING', 'CAMEL', 'told', 'adornment', 'special', 'effects', 'pacing', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'undoubtedly', 'mirror', 'Mongolian', 'camel', 'herding', 'life', 'found', 'attention', 'wandering', 'times', 'story', 'line', 'short', 'human', 'drama', 'even', 'animal', 'drama', 'minimized', 'size', 'family', 'sheep', 'camel', 'herds', 'hand-milking', 'mother', 'camel', 'hand-feeding', 'colt', 'family', 'well-being', 'baby', 'camel', 'survival', 'ever', 'issue.In', 'sum', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'examination', 'Mongolian', 'life', 'traditions', 'simply', 'directly', 'told', 'THE', 'STORY', 'THE', 'WEEPING', 'CAMEL', 'regrettably', 'also', 'less', 'not', 'always', 'more', 'Sometimes', 'really', 'just', 'less']",The Story of the Weeping Camel

At least that's what seemed to be the plan - it starts out with a heavy enough focus on smiling locals, bleating sheep and spitting camels, quaint costumes and weird cuisine.  The usual yawn inducing stuff.  At least that's my typical reaction. THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL, though, is hijacked very early on, and whatever plans it had to be a picturesque travelogue are jettisoned and replaced by a compelling and captivating drama.One of the camels is having a difficult labor, her first.  Her labor is caught by the camera in all its squirmy, graphic glory, by the way.  The white colt is finally delivered but is rejected by the mother.  There's no voiceover narration (Mongolian with subtitles) so there's nobody to tell us that when a mother camel rejects her colt she's deathly serious about it.  In a heartbreaking series of scenes, though, we learn it soon enough.  Finally, two young boys set out for a neighboring settlement to fetch a musician, for what we're not told, but the film makes it clear that the only hope for a mother and colt reunion rests with the musician.I suppose in programs like this there's always the possibility that certain scenes are staged, but this one looks real all the way through.  There's a chance the original family pulled down a  satellite dish and hid the family motor scooter, `cause there's sure enough of both at the settlements the boys travel through to find the vitally needed musician.  The core drama - colt rejection, reconciliation attempted through music - seems real enough.

865536,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0006FFRB6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[8, 10]","""The Story of the Weeping Camel"" is a documentary. It is important to mention this, because it instantly makes the film more interesting.A Mongolian family of sheep and camel herders anxiously awaits the last of this year's birth of camel colts.  A healthy colt is born and instantly bonds with its mother, following her around, nipping at her heels, suckling. This leaves one more birth. Checking on the last pregnant camel, the family goes to bed. Waking the next morning, they find that the camel is in the middle of giving birth. The white colt's front legs are out and its head is following. But the birth is very difficult. Finally, the colt is born and starts walking around. But the mother rejects it, not allowing it to suckle or even come near her. The family realizes this and attempts everything they can to bring mother and child together. Finally, they decide to contact a violinist from the nearby town and ask him to participate in a ritual that should bring mother and child back together again.National Geographic was involved in the filming in Mongolia, so the cinematography is crystal clear. The barren landscape seems, somehow, beautiful. Close-ups of the various family members break up the landscape a bit, but also add to the beauty of the surroundings. The life certainly appears hard, but it is all this small group of people knows.The family lives in a small collection of huts lined with rugs. The extended family of Grandpa, Grandma, Father, Mother and three children lives together, passing on the stories and skills they have learned from generation to generation. Relatively shut off from the rest of the world, they amuse each other with reminiscences and crude games.When they realize that they will need some outside help, a violinist, they send their oldest son, Dude, to a nearby settlement. Ugna, the second oldest, asks to tag along and they embark on their journey. Their first stop is a larger family encampment, connected to power lines. Ugna is immediately transfixed by the family's television and joins the many children clustered around. At the larger settlement, Ugna asks about the cost of a television. He also experiences ice cream, computer games, and more for the first time.At times, it is difficult to believe that this is a documentary. Clearly, the filmmakers stumbled upon the story while staying with the family. How else would they know the camel would reject her offspring? After the birth, they follow the story through. An indication that this is, in fact, a documentary, is the visit by the two sons to the larger settlement. As they walk through the village, other villagers stop and look at them, staring at the cameras. The cameras draw their attention. If they were actors, they would look away or otherwise avoid the cameras.The film paints an interesting portrait of this family. In a very subtle fashion, we get an idea of how the family lives, what they have to deal with on a daily basis and the pros and cons of living in such a remote society. A significant portion of the narrative is devoted to the camels. The cameras follow the mother and child around, depicting their relationship and showing us the problem that the family recognizes. Even though we are unable to communicate with the animals, and they are unable to tell us their feelings, the act of holding a camera on them for so long reveals some of these things through observation.""Weeping Camel"" is an interesting documentary to watch, but I am glad I caught it on DVD. I think I might have been slightly disappointed watching this film in a theater. The cinematography is crystal clear, and the landscape is interesting, but it is fairly monotonous to the eye. At home, the story became more the focus. The Mongolian family became more central to the viewing experience, as did the plight of the two camels.I'm not sure that very young children would be able to watch this film. The birth of the camel happens on camera. It was almost as difficult to watch this scene as it was to not watch this. Little children might be freaked out by it. Unless you can talk to them about this after watching the film. If not, the PG rating is probably an accurate guideline.""The Story of the Weeping Camel"" is a fascinating glimpse into a segment of the world's population we know so little about.

[SPOILER ALERT] For me it was profound, deeply spiritual, a respite- the shot of the Tibetan/Buddhist service in the middle of the bleak Mongolian landscape, the loving care with which the people carved the small camel figurines and braided halters for their camels- the respect and reverence they had for their environment, their animals, and for each other (across generations)- I was utterly charmed at times, moved to tears other times.  The trek to ""the city,"" how momentous was that?  The curiosity and mischievousness of the boys, the adults endlessly patient and loving.The shot of the blue scarf wrapped around the pole, fluttering in the wind, so simple and yet so meaningful, symbolic of their reverence and joy in living.  I was quite overcome during the ceremony with the camel and her colt.  MAGIC.  A million miles removed from ""life"" in the West.  All I can say is ""Ba.""Added later: I read a few negative reviews, some asking how it was that a German documentary filmmaker happened to be out in the middle of Mongolia, suggesting the whole thing was staged.

It's just life. Life in it's simple but raw beauty. If you watch this, you will see a camel giving birth to a rare white camel. That in itself is worth seeing. But watching the determined patience of the family to get mom (after a very difficult birth) to embrace her rejected newborn is very touching. This is must see cinematography!You also get to see a yurt, including the inside. I found it facinating to see how modern Mongolians live.

Basically, I just expected it to be an educational documentary on a rare subject, and I wanted to see the landscapes in the beautiful desert of Mongolia. To my surprise, I was very taken by this film, because it featured breath-taking cinematography of the Gobi Desert, and the story was very touching. I was especially moved by the relationship between the camels and their human owners. If you enjoyed Winged Migration and Whale Rider, then you are bound to love this film as well.The story is about a family and one of their female camels that was pregnant and how they assisted her to deliver her first baby. It took two days to deliver the white colt, and since it's feet came out first, it had caused a great deal of pain to the mother camel. Maybe that was the reason she refused to feed her baby. The neglected colt was to be feed by hand using milk that was gathered from another camel. The family decided to find a special musician to come and perform a ritual on the camel to help her become a good mother. The two boys of the family rode on camels to the town to invite the musician to return with them. During the ritual ceremony, the musician played an instrument while one of the woman in the family sang a special song to the camel. Within minutes, the mother camel started to cry. I mean she was actually shedding massive tears! That was how the miracle took place, and she finally allow her baby to suckle her breast for milk. I was totally mesmerized by that scene, because it really showed that the camel had feelings and was profoundly moved by the family.All of the cast members were the actual residents of that area, and they were very natural in front of the cameras. Except when the boys went to the town, everyone there were staring at the camera with curiosity. The special feature of the DVD has a photo gallery that has pictures of everyone including the cast and crew members. It would've been nice if they did a 'making of"" segment.

I'm glad I found that out afterwards, but I kind of wish I would have known that before. Either way, it's a beautiful and touching film.Set in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert, the main story focuses on a camel that gives birth to an albino colt and then refuses to care for it. The family sets to work on the task of getting the mother camel to accept it's baby and care for it. As this story is slowly unfolding, we get to witness the inner-workings of their day-to-day life.It really feels like a culture lesson, but an interesting one. The film is only 87 minutes long so it's not like it drags around or anything. It does move slow, but it moves appropriately slow, establishing the location, the family, and the importance of each camel and each life.The final scene of the music ritual that gets the mother camel to finally accept the baby camel is breathtaking and really makes the film.
