1338709,A3GA09FYFKL4EY,B003ES5JTW,Fruit Loop,"[5, 6]","""Deadliest Catch"" continues to thrill us and move us season after season, and of course hardcore fans wouldn't want to miss this one. A primary reason, of course, is Captain Phil's passing, but for this reviewer his battle was an underscore to the entire premise of the series: man against the elements, man against himself. Who are these men, why do they do this, and what drives them?Two captains switch ""Boat Sons"" as a new lesson and test of experience; Jake Anderson of the ""Northwestern"", still mourning the loss of his sister last season, faces the grim prospect of new grief; Russell of ""Time Bandit"" and most recently the ""Wizard"" faces another new start; Keith continues his attempt to build a strong crew; the Hillstrands and the Hansens cope with aging and the future of their boats as the future marches inexorably closer.Again to the obvious:  Discovery Channel did a masterful job photographing Phil's relationship with his sons, his collapse, subsequent battle and final acquiescence to his own mortality. Each episode depicted his struggle with respect for his family and sensitivity. Viewers can't help but weep although we already knew the outcome before the show aired.  This shouldn't be surprising, since we've seen the crew's gift for presenting the worst of human events (the Katmai, the Big Valley, and too many others) without exploitation or oversentiment, but DC exceeded this viewer's expectations. Thank you for giving us, the fans, a chance to say goodbye to one of the show's most beloved captains.Thank you, Jake and Josh, for sharing your dad with us. We had no right to intrude upon your family at such a time, but both of you, and Captain Phil himself, chose to give to us instead. May God bless the Harris family, and the soul of Captain Phil.This season will forever stand as one of the series' finest for its spectacular cinematography, spirit of adventure, gritty reality and strength of human spirit.

To those who are trying to decide on whether to buy this set on Amazon, I say, pass on it and get the 5 DVD set from Discovery channel.

Spend the few extra bucks and get the 5 disc set from Discovery Channel (it's on sale now at 40% off).  One final nit- picking point....they could have at least put Captain Phil Harris on the cover.

That, along with other personal struggles among the crews, made this a memorable season. I found it well-edited, well presented, and very moving. As someone who appreciates depictions of relationships above all other aspects of a production, this season was far more interesting to me than others, and is the only season I've made a point of watching in it's entirety. I don't plan to watch any future seasons, although wanting to know what becomes of the Harris brothers makes it tempting. There's something about the Harris family that makes me care about them more than the other families.
