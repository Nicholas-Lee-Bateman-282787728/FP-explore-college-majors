183434,A2CLUVY0XTPRZK,1562196979,H. Thompson,"[0, 0]","From the creator of Fatal Fury and Battle Arena Toshinden, this is one of the three video game titles that have been made into an anime from the same maker.  While if you were to line up the three, most people would probably pick Fatal Fury because of its stretched out storyline and lovable characters.  I, myself, prefer Gowcaizer overall because it offers great fighting, and some of the more top-of-the-line animation sequences in all of anime.  Ok, so the characters look a little strange at times (over-sharp, too much detail), but if you give the development of the characters time, then you can overlook some of the poorer things about this movie.Also, this movie is known for its ....well....""women""...  For some reason, incest was used for two cases in this movie (between brother and sister), which is a little gross, but I could overlook it for the rest of the movie's good sides. Fan Service is probably a leading factor why guys will buy this movie, but for me it was the animation and fight scenes.But all good things can't go without flaws!  The DVD itself was very poor looking.  Confusing at times too!  You will find yourself in a maze when you enter the chapter selection menu, and the title menu is just three selections (language, chapter selection, other) with a giant ""G"" (for Gowcaizer) in the background.  Very little effort was put into this DVD as far as menus were concerned.  But I look on the bright side...some DVDs don't even have menus!!  So I guess as long as they made an attempt I can live with it.Overall, if you are into any of the following:1.  Fan Service2.  Good animation3.  Semi-good storyline4.  Masami Ohbari's other worksThen I reccomend you pick this one up...",4,Masami Ohbari 's Best (in my opinion),1021507200,"05 16, 2002",2002,1708,"['creator', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'Battle', 'Arena', 'Toshinden', 'one', 'three', 'video', 'game', 'titles', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'anime', 'same', 'maker', 'were', 'line', 'up', 'three', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'pick', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'stretched', 'out', 'storyline', 'lovable', 'characters', 'prefer', 'Gowcaizer', 'overall', 'great', 'fighting', 'more', 'top-of-the-line', 'animation', 'sequences', 'anime', 'Ok', 'characters', 'look', 'little', 'strange', 'times', 'over-sharp', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'give', 'development', 'characters', 'time', 'then', 'can', 'overlook', 'poorer', 'things', 'movie.Also', 'movie', 'known', '.well', 'women', 'reason', 'incest', 'was', 'used', 'two', 'cases', 'movie', 'brother', 'sister', 'little', 'gross', 'could', 'overlook', 'rest', 'movie', 'good', 'sides', 'Fan', 'Service', 'probably', 'leading', 'factor', 'why', 'guys', 'will', 'buy', 'movie', 'was', 'animation', 'fight', 'scenes.But', 'good', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'looking', 'Confusing', 'times', 'too', 'will', 'find', 'maze', 'when', 'enter', 'chapter', 'selection', 'menu', 'title', 'menu', 'just', 'three', 'selections', 'language', 'chapter', 'selection', 'other', 'giant', 'G', 'Gowcaizer', 'background', 'Very', 'little', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'DVD', 'as', 'far', 'menus', 'were', 'concerned', 'look', 'bright', 'side', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'menus', 'guess', 'as', 'long', 'made', 'attempt', 'can', 'live', 'it.Overall', 'are', 'following:1', 'Fan', 'Service2', 'Good', 'animation3', 'Semi-good', 'storyline4', 'Masami', 'Ohbari', 'other', 'worksThen', 'reccomend', 'pick', 'one', 'up']",N/A

In fact, it's probably the best video game-based anime out there next to Fatal Fury. Excellent artwork, good dubbing, and a pretty good techno soundtrack are in this movie.

183439,A13SMNS5QLSC9Y,1562196979,Todd Rennells,"[7, 7]","I can't help comparing this movie to Fatal Fury, since they have similar animation styles and were probably made by the same people.  If you liked  FF, you MIGHT like this one.If what you liked about FF were the  animation, character designs, and fight scenes, you will probably like  this.  Also, Voltage Fighters portrays its women the same as FF, that is,  with lots of big bouncing breasts and gratuitous nudity.  If you like this  (as I wholeheartedly do) then this could be the movie for you.  (If you  don't I don't think anime is the hobby for you.)If, however, you liked  Fatal Fury because it had a well-developed plot, you might want to steer  clear of this.  The basic story is that there are good guys and bad guys  (though which is which is not always clear), the bad guys want to destroy  the earth, and the good guys want to stop them.  If there was more to it  than that (like, say, a reason for any of it) then I missed it  completely.For all its failings, though, this is a Japanese animation.  Like almost all of them, it is a primarily visual treat, and in that way  it's not half bad.",3,Not so great,966211200,"08 14, 2000",2000,1106,"['ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'comparing', 'movie', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'have', 'similar', 'animation', 'styles', 'were', 'probably', 'made', 'same', 'people', 'liked', 'FF', 'MIGHT', 'what', 'liked', 'FF', 'were', 'animation', 'character', 'designs', 'fight', 'scenes', 'will', 'probably', 'Also', 'Voltage', 'Fighters', 'women', 'same', 'FF', 'lots', 'big', 'bouncing', 'breasts', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'like', 'wholeheartedly', 'do', 'then', 'could', 'be', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anime', 'hobby', 'however', 'liked', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'had', 'well-developed', 'plot', 'might', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'basic', 'story', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'bad', 'guys', 'want', 'destroy', 'earth', 'good', 'guys', 'want', 'stop', 'was', 'more', 'say', 'reason', 'then', 'missed', 'failings', 'though', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'almost', 'primarily', 'visual', 'treat', 'way', 'not', 'half', 'bad']",N/A
