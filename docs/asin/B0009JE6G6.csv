I had to give it a few episodes to hook me, but hook me it ultimately did. Much of Earth2 is pretty standard sci-fi fare, but the things that are new and interesting make this something more than the usual genre mishmash given to us by the networks.Humanity has messed up in the biggest possible way and Earth is no longer habitable - at all. For generations, people have been living on space stations that orbit earth and the moon and we have taken our problems and our hierarchies to the space stations with us along with a few problems we didn't foresee, like the fact that many children born in the sterile atmosphere of the stations are subject to a mortal illness referred to only as the syndrome. Devon Adair is a wealthy young mother who is hoping to take her son to a habitable planet where he and other children like him will be cured. She has gathered 250 families for this mission and is awaiting permission to leave. Her expedition is sabotaged but she and a few others get away and are stranded on the planet. A planet on which they are not alone. The indigenous inhabitants are hard to understand, but peaceful in the extreme unless threatened. But, other humans have been there too, scientists and penal colonists, used to test the capacity of the planet. These and other dangers, as well as the political machinations of the government back home and a spy in the midst of the group make up the action.There is more here than originally meets the eye.

I only remembered seeing parts of two or three episodes when they were actually aired. I was recommended it by a friend, who'd watched every episode faithfully until the show was abruptly canceled. Bummer.The series follows the Eden Advance team, a group of colonists headed by Devon Adair, who (following a secret govenment plot to destroy their ship) crash land on the planet, losing most of their gear and passengers. A small group survives, and has to make a cross-continental trek to reach the intended landing site, in order to meet the main body of colonists, who are scheduled to arrive shortly. The series was abandoned mid-season in season 1.I would have rated this item 5 stars, but the quality of the DVD encoding took away at least 1 1/2 stars. Since you can't give 1/2 star ratings, I rounded up. There were several times where the disk would freeze, there were a few spots that were horribly pixelated, and the sound got choppy. This usually was short-lived, however. The exception being that my disk set came with two disk 2s and no disk 3. One of the two duplicates actually was defective, so after two or three weeks of emails, got the publisher to send me a pre-paid envelope to return on of them in exchange for a disk 3. Obviously, I sent the defective one.I've read several reviews where the reviewer talked about bad acting in the series. Honestly, I never saw this. The only exception was some of the acting by the two children in the series. Obviously, I expect child actors, especially 8 year olds, to have some issues with heavy emotionally-charged scenes. As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, there are some of the finest actors in Hollywood represented, e.g. Jessica Steen (Armageddon, CSI and more TV shows than I can list), and Clancy Brown (best known as the Kurgan from Highlander, also in The Guardian (2006), Starship Troopers, etc.).After sitting down and watching the series (keeping in mind that it was made 12 years ago so many of the props look dated) the one thing I'm left with is this sense of wondering what happened to the Eden Advance crew. Did they make it to New Pacifica? Did Danziger (Clancy Brown) ever get together with Devon Adair (Debrah Farentino)? Did anyone ever slap that annoying Morgan (John Gegenhuber)? I think it says alot that I came to care about these people, even after only 'getting to know them' for half a season of episodes. I think that several characters (Morgan) were played so well that I really felt like I knew that person - and in Morgan's case, wanted to see him slapped around a bit. I think that says alot about the acting, and the writing of the screenplays.I've seen fan fiction online where people have continued the storyline, but it's not the same. I'm saddened to say that this show hasn't had the same cult following that Firefly had, so it's not likely that a feature film will be made from the story, giving us a glimpse of what ever became of these poor souls trapped on a distant planet.",4,Left Me Wanting More,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,3048,"['ordered', 'DVD', 'set', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'entire', 'episode', 'only', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'parts', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'when', 'were', 'actually', 'aired', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'who', ""'d"", 'watched', 'episode', 'faithfully', 'show', 'was', 'abruptly', 'canceled', 'Bummer.The', 'series', 'Eden', 'Advance', 'team', 'group', 'colonists', 'headed', 'Devon', 'Adair', 'who', 'following', 'secret', 'govenment', 'plot', 'destroy', 'ship', 'crash', 'land', 'planet', 'losing', 'most', 'gear', 'passengers', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'make', 'cross-continental', 'trek', 'reach', 'intended', 'landing', 'site', 'order', 'meet', 'main', 'body', 'colonists', 'who', 'are', 'scheduled', 'arrive', 'shortly', 'series', 'was', 'abandoned', 'mid-season', 'season', '1.I', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'item', '5', 'stars', 'quality', 'DVD', 'encoding', 'took', 'away', 'least', '1', '1/2', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', '1/2', 'star', 'ratings', 'rounded', 'up', 'were', 'several', 'times', 'where', 'disk', 'would', 'freeze', 'were', 'few', 'spots', 'were', 'horribly', 'pixelated', 'sound', 'got', 'choppy', 'usually', 'was', 'short-lived', 'however', 'exception', 'being', 'disk', 'set', 'came', 'two', 'disk', '2s', 'disk', '3', 'One', 'two', 'duplicates', 'actually', 'was', 'defective', 'so', 'two', 'three', 'weeks', 'emails', 'got', 'publisher', 'send', 'pre-paid', 'envelope', 'return', 'exchange', 'disk', '3', 'Obviously', 'sent', 'defective', 'one.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'several', 'reviews', 'where', 'reviewer', 'talked', 'bad', 'acting', 'series', 'Honestly', 'never', 'saw', 'only', 'exception', 'was', 'acting', 'two', 'children', 'series', 'Obviously', 'expect', 'child', 'actors', 'especially', '8', 'year', 'olds', 'have', 'issues', 'heavy', 'emotionally-charged', 'scenes', 'As', 'far', 'rest', 'cast', 'concerned', 'are', 'finest', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'represented', 'e.g', 'Jessica', 'Steen', 'Armageddon', 'CSI', 'more', 'TV', 'shows', 'can', 'list', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'best', 'known', 'Kurgan', 'Highlander', 'also', 'Guardian', '2006', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'etc', '.After', 'sitting', 'down', 'watching', 'series', 'keeping', 'mind', 'was', 'made', '12', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'many', 'props', 'look', 'dated', 'one', 'thing', ""'m"", 'left', 'sense', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'Eden', 'Advance', 'crew', 'Did', 'make', 'New', 'Pacifica', 'Did', 'Danziger', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'ever', 'get', 'together', 'Devon', 'Adair', 'Debrah', 'Farentino', 'Did', 'anyone', 'ever', 'annoying', 'Morgan', 'John', 'Gegenhuber', 'think', 'alot', 'came', 'care', 'people', 'even', 'only', ""'getting"", 'know', 'season', 'episodes', 'think', 'several', 'characters', 'Morgan', 'were', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'really', 'felt', 'knew', 'person', 'Morgan', 'case', 'wanted', 'see', 'slapped', 'bit', 'think', 'alot', 'acting', 'writing', 'screenplays.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fan', 'fiction', 'online', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'continued', 'storyline', 'not', 'same', ""'m"", 'saddened', 'say', 'show', ""n't"", 'had', 'same', 'cult', 'following', 'Firefly', 'had', 'not', 'likely', 'feature', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'story', 'giving', 'glimpse', 'what', 'ever', 'became', 'poor', 'souls', 'trapped', 'distant', 'planet']",Earth 2: The Complete Series

Barrios,"[1, 3]","This is going to be a short review because I'm only going to bring up what others didn't.I recall watching an episode or two of this show when it originally aired. At the time, I didn't think much of the show, especially since Clancy Brown starred in it. I'm used to him playing bad-guy roles and felt his presence didn't fit in a sci-fi show. However, a few years after that, I caught the reruns and decided to give it a fair chance. I admit Earth 2 began to grow on me. I started to look forward to each upcoming episode. I got into the characters' hopes and fears and their interaction with alien life on the planet.Now to what irritated me about Earth 2:1. Morgan (John Gegenhuber) as a character quickly got on my nerves. He wasn't a team player and acted impulsively most of the time. I desperately wanted him to fall off a cliff and break his neck. Yeah, he's that annoying and so is his wife. Why they wrote his character into the show is a mystery to me because Morgan did nothing to propel the story.2. The special effects for big explosions were amateurish. Rather than rely on the CGI of the time, they should've used real explosives or paid for a better effects artist.3.

906711,A3T6HX48F66512,B0009JE6G6,Fry Boy,"[3, 5]","I missed this when it first ran in the early nineties, but I was always curious about it, especially since one of the Lone Gunmen from ""The X Files"" made a comment about it.  Ever since then I had to check out ""Earth 2.""Although I'm a big science-fiction fan, ""Earth 2"" is not quite engaging enough.  It's not horrible, but it's not great either.  If you watch it after 10 P.M. and you find yourself falling asleep, you might conclude that you're just tired.  Or maybe it's that coupled with the subconscious realization that the ""Earth 2"" story isn't moving along with anything remotely akin to rising action.  It sort of plods along, telling an interesting story, but never quite gripping your attention enough to say, ""Wait until you see what happens next.""All the complaints about the show are valid.  These include but are not limited to:1) Too much focus is placed on the girl and boy in the first few episodes, leading to the suspicion that this is a kiddie show;2) Clancy Brown needs to get his Kurgan (sp?) on, whip out a broadsword and take charge (Tim Curry: ""Charge!"");3) Group leadership is weak and unfocused, or as Higgy Baby would say, ""Sorely lacking"";4) No one is especially cautious when exploring ""Earth 2"" (I mean, beings pop out of the ground all the time!);5) Camp security is abysmal (that one guy is ALWAYS asleep with his gun);6) Cacti (or cactuses, if you prefer the new English) are on ""Earth 2"" (well I'll be!);7) The captain of the ship in episodes one and two has white hair and black eyebrows and doesn't exude ""captain-ness"" at all;8) The stories do not usually make for compelling viewing (sorry about putting two ""ings"" next to each other);9) Anthony Sabato Jr. exudes the early nineties (really, check his hair), giving the show a somewhat dated look (if you think that's bad, check out the ""Starlost"" series).10) No one seems to realize that they'd all be dead without Danziger (the Clancy Brown character).  Show some appreciation.Good things about the show:1) Terry O'Quinn (a favorite actor of mine);2) Clancy Brown (another favorite actor of mine);3) Debrah Farentino (although not as ""hot"" as she is now [OLDER!]; see ""Eureka"" the TV series);4) The Terrians are very well-done alien life forms;5) Tim Curry chews up the scenery and brings the acting level up a bit.Finally, a note regarding the packaging.  The DVDs do not have full-disc labels on either side, so it's all silver here, silver there.  Also, shows like this make me question whether or not my DVD player/recorder is about to give up the ghost.  A double-sided DVD is never desired, as far as I'm concerned, because you've always got to worry about fingerprinting either side, plus there's always the ""which is Side A and which is Side B?"" or, instead, ""if I put the disc with the little ""Side A"" label facing up, will the Side A shows come on or the Side B ones?""  These ""Earth 2"" discs seemed to stick much more frequently than other shows I've seen (which generally don't stick at all).Enjoy the show.",3,Decent show despite its flaws; spotty DVD quality,1248998400,"07 31, 2009",2009,3010,"['missed', 'when', 'first', 'ran', 'early', 'nineties', 'was', 'always', 'curious', 'especially', 'one', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'X', 'Files', 'made', 'comment', 'Ever', 'then', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'Earth', '2', ""'m"", 'big', 'science-fiction', 'fan', 'Earth', '2', 'not', 'quite', 'engaging', 'enough', 'not', 'horrible', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'watch', '10', 'P.M.', 'find', 'falling', 'asleep', 'might', 'conclude', ""'re"", 'just', 'tired', 'coupled', 'subconscious', 'realization', 'Earth', '2', 'story', ""n't"", 'moving', 'along', 'anything', 'remotely', 'akin', 'rising', 'action', 'sort', 'plods', 'telling', 'interesting', 'story', 'never', 'quite', 'gripping', 'attention', 'say', 'Wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'complaints', 'show', 'are', 'valid', 'include', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'to:1', 'Too', 'much', 'focus', 'placed', 'girl', 'boy', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'leading', 'suspicion', 'kiddie', 'show', '2', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'get', 'Kurgan', 'sp', 'whip', 'out', 'broadsword', 'take', 'charge', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Charge', '3', 'Group', 'leadership', 'weak', 'unfocused', 'Higgy', 'Baby', 'would', 'say', 'Sorely', 'lacking', '4', 'one', 'especially', 'cautious', 'when', 'exploring', 'Earth', '2', 'mean', 'beings', 'pop', 'ground', 'time', '5', 'Camp', 'security', 'abysmal', 'one', 'guy', 'ALWAYS', 'asleep', 'gun', '6', 'Cacti', 'cactuses', 'prefer', 'new', 'English', 'are', 'Earth', '2', 'well', ""'ll"", 'be', '7', 'captain', 'ship', 'one', 'two', 'white', 'hair', 'black', 'eyebrows', ""n't"", 'exude', 'captain-ness', '8', 'stories', 'do', 'not', 'usually', 'make', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'sorry', 'putting', 'two', 'ings', 'next', 'other', '9', 'Anthony', 'Sabato', 'Jr.', 'early', 'nineties', 'really', 'check', 'hair', 'giving', 'show', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'look', 'think', 'bad', 'check', 'out', 'Starlost', 'series', '.10', 'No', 'one', 'realize', ""'d"", 'be', 'dead', 'Danziger', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'character', 'Show', 'appreciation.Good', 'things', 'show:1', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'favorite', 'actor', 'mine', '2', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'favorite', 'actor', 'mine', '3', 'Debrah', 'Farentino', 'not', 'hot', 'now', '[', 'OLDER', ']', 'see', 'Eureka', 'TV', 'series', '4', 'Terrians', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'alien', 'life', 'forms', '5', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'up', 'scenery', 'acting', 'level', 'bit.Finally', 'note', 'regarding', 'packaging', 'DVDs', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'full-disc', 'labels', 'side', 'silver', 'here', 'silver', 'there', 'Also', 'make', 'question', 'not', 'DVD', 'player/recorder', 'give', 'up', 'ghost', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'never', 'desired', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', ""'ve"", 'always', 'got', 'worry', 'fingerprinting', 'side', 'always', 'Side', 'A', 'Side', 'B', 'instead', 'put', 'disc', 'little', 'Side', 'A', 'label', 'facing', 'up', 'will', 'Side', 'A', 'come', 'Side', 'B', 'ones', 'Earth', '2', 'discs', 'seemed', 'stick', 'much', 'more', 'frequently', 'other', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'stick', '.Enjoy', 'show']",Earth 2: The Complete Series

HOWEVER, the script, special effects (if one should even be so bold as to call them that), and the acting were all far below acceptable, and being believable was out of the question thus shattering any illusions of an otherwise good story line.Little rubber dolls that purr like a cat and move so stilted across the screen so that one looks for the strings someone had to be manipulating like a puppet? Come on!And ""Morgan""? Ah, yes, Morgan, the employee of the Council caught up on this journey? Whoever wrote his character profile and behavior for this series had to have been someone mentally on par with a student in the fifth or sixth grade with minimal writing experience and NO experience with adult human emotions and behavior. Morgan's behavior, or how the screenwriters had him behaving, as well as his lines was not just unbelievable, it is pathetic. I find it difficult to believe any director or producer would even allow acting like that on the set.  Morgan was  about as realistic and believable as the little purring rubber creature.And Bess, Morgan's pretty young wife who is obviously intelligent, why on earth would she be so in love with her husband's idiotic and childish behavior with the mental stability of a 10-year old? With all the actors there is either over-acting or deadpan reactions.The new planet they are on... G889, twenty-two light years from earth, I believe, is even more laughable! When they communicate with the space stations orbiting earth with those funky headsets, they have an instant connection and instant conversation over the distance of 22 LIGHT YEARS?  You bet! And the ""alien planet"" is very obviously southwestern Colorado or northern New Mexico, and certainly not any alien world whatsoever.This is obviously a seriously low budget film and I am trying to finish watching the rest of this series because I abhor the thought of not finishing the thing after I spent good money on it.

The solution: building space stations that orbit the planet. Entire generations are now born on these sterile stations, never even seeing Earth. The only information most humans living on these stations have on Earth is from stories and legends. From what we gather, Earth is so toxic that burning wood is considered a crime and the atmosphere is so contaminated that exposure to the elements is impossible. As a result of existence outside of their natural environment, some people have developed illnesses, the so called ""Syndrome"", that does not allow them to live past childhood. One such individual is the son of billionaire Devon Adair, Ulysses Adair (or Uly). Having the money and resources, she puts together a team of colonists to travel with her to the Earth-like planet in the G8 system 22 lightyears away. Government officials have other plans for them though and in an attempt to defy these officials, Adair and her team decide to go on the trip by escaping authorities. After 22 years of cryoststic stasis, the crew awakens and shortly after crash lands on the planet. Now, suddenly stranded on this strange planet on the other side of the galaxy,  without any of the equipment they came with, the colonists have to find ways to make do - looking for the basics of life: food, water and shelter. To make matters worse, their communicator dish has landed on the wrong side of the continent, necessitating that they embark on a long journey to the far coast to meet up at the planned coordinates in a place known as Pacifica.From a sci-fi perspective they could not have picked a better and more intriguing theme. First of all, it is fascinating to have a glimpse into a future in which the very basic things we take for granted today become rarities and luxuries, such as clean water from a spring, dirt and earth that you can touch without a haz mat suit, sunlight on your skin, breathing in air that has not been filtered and sanitized in any shape, picking up a fruit from a tree and eating it... This show did a great job at laying out the rather abysmal future that human kind finds itself in while at the same time offering hope by letting these people discover this planet that is so much like Earth before the fall. Another interesting aspect of the show was the socio-economic background around the show: hug class chasms, ordered lives on stations, authoritative government most likely in power through undemocratic means, inherited debt, indentured servitude and of course worst of all, a future in which they are incapable of sustaining life on the only planet hospitable to them. In a way humans are orphans, driven off their planet at their own hands and now they have to find a new home or else go extinct in two generations. There is a great scene in the beginning of their journey where it starts to rain one day and everyone immediately panics and takes shelter because from Earth they dont know rain to be anything but toxic. It doesnt even occur to them that it might not be. When they then find out that it in fact is clean, the wave of relief and joy that sweeps across their faces is quite touching. I thought that scene to be powerful as it gave us a glimpse into the grim reality humans find themselves in the not too distant future.I also like shows in which a group of people just become stranded somewhere without any means of getting home, trying to survive. Earth 2 is all about survival and the adventure: traversing the vast land, looking for the basics of life, setting up camp, encountering strange phenomena, landscapes and creatures. There is also a mysticism to it as related to these human settlers and the native life they encounter. The feeling  that they are the only humans on this planet further gives the show that feeling of desolation and solitude. In fact, after watching this show for a while even the audience feels claustrophobic and confined - mirroring the feeling the colonists have on this planet where they are stuck and lost. The big, great unknown. This show was sort of like the rough it out, wagon-train meets sci-fi on a strange Earth-like planet. Such scenarios open opportunities for exploring a myriad number of story arcs and themes and Earth 2 definitely took the right direction.I also liked that petty soap-opera type of emotions were left out to really focus on the story and the journey.  These days most shows feel like deep psychological expos&eacute;s of the characters; sort of like a soap opera but more complicated. Every theme and show, no matter how trivial, has to morph into some sort of psychological analysis of its characters, which can get tiring and taxing. Real people dont behave like that in real life. Earth 2 depicts characters that are real instead of constantly in their heads being psychoanalyzed by the writers and the audience.Unfortunately, despite such a strong promise in the premise of the story, the deliverance left some things to be desired. There are many episodes that are just beautifully written as well as being intelligent and thoughtful but instead of going on on that strong note, episodes were interspersed in there where you just have to wonder why the writers squandered all that opportunity. The slow episodes might really have driven the audience away so early on.Another problem was that chemistry was missing between the characters, especially between Devon and Danzinger and Julia and Alonzo. You just cant feel it. I also think that the show just became too slow for people after a while. I mean here you got this group of people landed on a strange planet and all they do is treck and camp and have weird experiences. No action is happening, no tension, no real drama - it's all in the woods, earthy colors, rugged gear - nothing fancy. There us also no sci-fi jargon and futuristic sets - it just feel like here and people didnt want to see that. I think that is why the show eventually got cancelled, it had the right themes and philosophy but that vision was not realized such that it was  gripping.Here are some of the questions that arise when watching the show, at least for me:* If these people have the kinds of technologies that allow them to travel light years, go into cryostatic stasis, grow horses in a canteen basically, and genetically engineer humans for specified professions, why could they not find a way to make earth habitable?* With all these genetic engineering tools at their disposal, why could they not have simply engineered the ""syndrome"" out of everyone - before birth. Apparently not everyone has it so there must be a gene for it, which they could have isolated given their sophisticated tools.* The cryostatic mode of traveling long distances did not make sense. In the beginning they state that some of the people on the ship, like Alonzo, were just hired hands to drop off the colonists. Yet they go into cryostatic sleep for 22 year with the rest, meaning 22 years have passed. How did those people think this was going to work out? They go back home after 44 years when everything they knew changed and aged for nearly half a century. Who would do that? It basically means throwing away your life and leaving behind the life you know. You can't say ""bye honey, see you in 44 years when you are 70 and I'm still 25"". Also, in those 22 years the crew was in stasis, new technologies may have developed that could put a whole new spin to the journey or maybe the government changed etc. And what about the government officials that run the stations. Were they waiting for 22 years in order to get their informant get in touch with Hiller? The whole sleeping for decades thing just did not make much sense. It's one thing to go away for a job for 6 months or a year or 5 years, it is quite something else to go into stasis for decades as part of a job, not age while everyone around you does, then wake up and just move on like you hadnt just lapsed through a couple of generations essentially. That part was just a little out of focus.* How did these people manage to not look malnourished and emaciated given that we never see them hunt anything or any other mammals for that matter in the show and given that this planet seems like a barren, arid desert. They all looked well fed and healthy which is not likely when you are on an almost year long camping trip/trek cross country trekking through the roiguh wilderness and trying to overcome a harsh winter without any reliable sources of food. Surely people cannot look like that while feasting on fruits and berries - which is the only thing we ever see them look for.But these are just a few of the details I think could have been worked out better. Overall I think this was a very entertaining as well as quite intriguing series which I am sure would have taken up during season 2 had the network given it some time. There was just so much potential but the writers and producers failed to make it stand out early on for the network to keep and the audience be enticed. Of course for the fast-paced, Jersey-shore generation of today this show would seem too slow and not as ""hip"" or ""cool"". Earth 2 is more like a slow cooked savory meal that has to be taken in equally slowly and with patience. Most TV shows are like colorful, spicy, south-of-the-border, conspiracy theory hors d'oeuvres: pick a little bit of everything here and there, create hotness, sex and explosions and call it a show. I really like that in Earth 2 it WASNT all about who is doing whom and who is hooking up with whom.  It is pure adventure while at the same time intelligently tackling issues of environmentalism, justice, redemption, metaphysics, social justice etc.I just recently found the promo video for season 2 of Earth 2, completely ""rethought, restyled and retooled"" - while i was repulsed - on YouTube. The revamping would have meant they reach Pacifica,  Yale gets written off the show as well as the Terrains apparently, and Morgan is said to just have ran away so now Bess can focus on ""new romances"" in this new colony (read: soap opera). Needless to say that the re-imagined what would have been season 2 does not look very promising, mainly because getting there is half the fun. I mean THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT of the show: traveling through an unknown planet and braving challenges. And as much I dislike Morgan, he provided comic relief and I do like it when unlikable people redeem themselves as their role in the group manifests and rise above the occasion. Morgan had that potential - just as Yale. Anyway the promo didnt look very worthwhile, in fact it looked pretty disappointing, so maybe we should all be glad it wasn't continued - at least not on that note. These people came to this planet with the hope of finding a way to heal humanity. Without a real continuation we will never find out what happens to those people: if they reach Pacifica and get to establish their colony, what other adventures await them on the long journey there, if the Council pursues them, their relation to the Terrians, the other alien lives they may have encountered, whether Devon and Danzinger finally come around, if Alonzo and Julia ever take the next step and whether Uly will ever get to slay his monsters...",4,Intriguing Sc-Fi Show That Did Not Get The Chance to Fully Reach Its Potential,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,11576,"['Earth', '2',

906722,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0009JE6G6,MadMacs,"[0, 1]","***Spoiler Warning***Screened again out of nostalgia. In the stark light of 2013, certain actors and their performances held up well; others not so much. Ditto the story arcs which ran the gamut from pretty darn good to routine rubber stamp.A dying Earth is seeding its first exo-terrestrial colonies. The five most compatible planets are being tested to see which one will become our new home. One particular blue globe, G-889, twenty-two light years away is considered the prime candidate. And under the guise of helping the ""Syndrome Children"", desperately ill young ones suffering having lived their entire lives aboard sterile space stations, a group of pioneers has been chosen to resettle there.Unknown to them, a shadowy geopolitical cabal known as The Council, wants more than just a fresh chance to restart humanity. They've known that leaving our doomed home was the only real option for a very long time. For more than two generations they've planned, plotted and manipulated their way to controlling whichever system is chosen. But G-889 is much more than just Earth-like. Its native inhabitants are mystically and biologically bonded to the planet itself. Interestingly, The Council already knows this. Has known about it for years. And they're holding back that secret knowledge because it will likely kill most of the first generation pioneers. Unless they, the people of Eden Project, do something unexpected to prevent it.Some Of The Good:- The plot line which had Dr. Julia Heller's clandestine communications with The Council. Probably the one arc that felt most real and delivered the best drama. Jessica Steen played the part with absolute perfection as one of the survivors and a simultaneous mole. It's a theme that would be later replicated by several more successful programs like 'Lost'. If the writers had incorporated more of this type of hidden agenda threads and less on the somewhat sketchy supernatural aspects, perhaps we'd be referring to this program as ""That great scifi classic"", instead of a barely remembered blip on the television landscape.- Thought the comedic psuedo-fellatio scene in ""Water"" was hilarious! Right up there with 'Airplane' and the AutoPilot emergency inflation system. :-D  Glad they tried to incorporate this kind of humor. Sex has always been a part of classic scifi. It's a damn shame that so many modern productions seem to bow down to the gods of political correctness by substituting graphic violence for something that is fun, funny, enjoyable, and in the right context - beautiful. Shameful that PC is slowly eroding the very soul that makes good scifi such a wonderful place to explore - turning it banal and trite. Sad.- ""Survival Of The Fittest"" was probably the strongest drama the show presented in its single season. A riff on Kurosawa's eternal 'Rashomon', as four survivors recount their struggle without water, food or hope. Their desperate actions are slowly revealed as they face the crimes of unlawful intrusion, manslaughter and infanticide. A superior episode with outstanding performances.Some Of The Not So Good:- Pretty much anything involving the star of the program, Devon Adair, played to annoying perfection by Debrah Farentino. Her interpretation of the character could sometimes be infuriating; a grating mix of arrogant patronizer and ever-fearful mom. Like many helicopter parents - wearing blinders to the exclusion of the welfare of others. Made even more aggravating since it was her responsibility to care for and lead the survivors.Could the show creators have found a different, better, actress for the role? I think so.Overall, 'Earth 2' was a very decent series with some very real potential. The last couple of episodes really seemed to gel, indicating that the producers and writers might've finally discovered the right formula, the right balance. But it came too late. The audience capture was long gone when it came time for renewal.It's really unfortunate that we'll never know how things might've turned out.Another argument for the Amazon half-star. I'm caught between a high three and a low four.Call it a high three.Show Notes:- As I mentioned, the use of a mole posing as one of the survivors would be used to much greater effect and to much greater success in a series like ""Lost"". Which is ironic because one of the frequent guest stars which fueled the mole/conspiracy themes was Terry O'Quinn - who discovered this stranded survivor formula mixed with mystic elements could indeed be extremely successful.- In 1994, when this show was produced, there was no proof exoplanets existed. Science had debated it for centuries and it seemed like we'd never know the answer, at least not in our lifetimes. But ten years later, that theory was confirmed; ending and upending all debate. We had incontrovertible proof that such planets existed. And it took another half decade to discover ""Earth-like"" planets in what is now known as the Goldilocks Zone. Freakishly, one series of planets in the Scorpius System - Planet Gliese 667Cc specifically - is just about 22 light years away and sits dead center in the habitable zone. Now, of course it's several times bigger than our terra firma, but I find it an amazing coincidence that 'Earth 2' envisioned such a planet with such uncanny prescience.Personal Note:- Was terribly saddened to learn that young J. Madison Wright, who portrayed True Danzinger, fell ill at such a young age. God bless you Madison. And bless co-star Clancy Brown who helped her family pay for the expensive medical treatment that allowed her a few more years with us.",3,An Early Ensemble Theme That Would Find Later

906725,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0009JE6G6,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[327, 336]","Michael Duggan, Carol Flint, Mark Levin and Billy Ray created an interesting concept for a new sci-fi TV program.  Airing in the fall of 1994, their show was entitled ""Earth 2"" and was set 200 years in the future.  ""Earth 2"" painted a very dark future for mankind in which the Earth is no longer capable of supporting terrestrial life.  Consequently, the surviving members of the human race have been living in orbiting space stations; but living in the sterile environments has created a sickness called the Syndrome.  A wealthy woman named Devon Adair (Debrah Farentino) is convinced that the key to mankind's survival, including her Syndrome-infected son Ulysses 'Uly' Adair (Joey Zimmerman), is to once again live in a natural environment.  Gathering 250 other Syndrome-infected families, she pursues the establishment of a colony on a planet named G889 orbiting a star 22 light-years away; but the current government has other plans for planet G889. Undeterred, Devon, her son and some of the other 250 families embark on a ship named ""Eden Advance"" for G889 to establish a community in advance of the main colonization; but the ship has been sabotaged.  The ship arrives at G889, but the ship soon explodes.  Stranded on G889, the ship's survivors attempt to settle and begin new lives on G889.  The survivors include Devon, Uly, engineer John Danziger (Clancy Brown), his daughter True (J. Madison Wright), pilot Alonzo Solace (Antonio Sabato Jr.), Dr. Julia Heller (Jessica Steen), Earth-government representative Morgan Martin (John Gegenhuber), his wife Bess (Rebecca Gayheart) and Uly's cyborg teacher Yale (Sullivan Walker).Unfortunately, lower than expected ratings for the series caused its cancellation after its first season; so only a total of 22 episodes were ever produced. These episodes include the following:1. ""First Contact (1)"".  The embarkation to G889, destruction of the ship and survivors reaching the planet's surface.  G889 is inhabited by subterranean natives called Terrians.2. ""First Contact (2)"".  Uly is abducted by Terrians, but he is returned after they heal him from they Syndrome.3. ""The Man Who Fell to Earth (Two)"". An astronaut who had previously crash-landed on G889, Gaal (Tim Curry), kills the commander (Richard Bradford).  Solace has Terrian dreams.4. ""Life Lessons"". Gaal tries to disrupt the survivors' encampment.5. ""Promises, Promises"".  Gaal abducts several Terrians; but the colonists free them. Gaal disappears underground and is never seen again.6. ""A Memory Play"".  The colonists discover a third escape pod with people infected by a woman that had been implanted by the government to sabotage the ship.  Grendler saliva is the cure.7. ""Water"". Devon & Dazinger search for water.8. ""The Church of Morgan"". Morgan & Bess argue while Dr. Heller contemplates removing Uly's pineal gland; but Uly is becoming an evolutionary link with the Terrians.9. ""The Enemy Within"". Dr. Heller injects some of Uly's DNA into herself, she goes nuts and is abandoned.10. ""Redemption"". Dr. Heller rejoins the colonists thanks to Solace.11. ""Moon Cross"". A woman, Mary (Kelli Williams), is found living among the Terrians, who want Uly to be their link with colonists.12. ""Better Living Through Morganite (1)"". As Yale regains his memory, Morgan finds glowing rocks.13. ""Better Living Through Morganite (2)"".  Mary saves Yale from Terrian punishment after he's been captured (along with Morgan and Bess) and finds out he's not a criminal.14. ""Grendlers in the Myst"". The colonists believe they have located a killer, but he's only the son of the real killer that's now only a hologram.15. ""The Greatest Love Story Never Told"". Danzinger comes across a colony of reformed criminals16. ""Brave New Pacifica"". Two scavenging Grendlers come across a box containing human blood.17. ""After the Thaw"". Dazinger is possessed by a an evil Terrian's spirit.18. ""The Boy Who Would be Terrian King"". A future version of Uly travels back in time to have Devon hide some his blood.19. ""Survival of the Fittest"".  Several colonists start to act strange after consuming a Grendler when they are stranded.20. ""All About Eve"".  Dying from a mysterious disease, the colonists find a crashed ship from 100 years ago whose computer may explain the cure.21. ""Natural Born Grendlers"". Solace gets depressed about being marooned while Devon & Bess trade for supplies with a friendly Grendler.22. ""Flower Child"".  Dazinger & Bess have strange symptoms after being sprayed with a native plant's pollen.Overall, I rate ""Earth 2-The Complete Series"" with 5 out of 5 stars.

They were interesting, but being a fan of hard sci-fi and humor, they just didn't do as much for me as they could of.  Well, when it came out on DVD I decided to watch it, from start to finish.  Maybe I would enjoy it more now that time had passed?  And I did enjoy some parts - the characters are all well developed (or still developing), some of the science - like the gear, Zero, the equipment - were well thought out and the aliens were interesting.  And many of the female actors were hot.But much of the science was fantasy. I'm just not into soft sci-fi in a TV series. Also, there was little, to no, humor and stories were not very strong.  Two ghost stories in the same season?  How many times did the Hummer and other groundcraft break down?  How many people were in the crew total?  New people seemed to pop up every few episodes!  There was even time travel on the dreamscape!Also, while the DVDs have the episodes in order in which they were aired, episode 20 should be viewed before episode 05 and episode 21 should be viewed after 17.  Otherwise they don't make any sense.  The extras are mixed - the blooper reel and deleted scenes were interesting, but why have a Slider bonus episode and a Cleopatra 2525 bonus episode?

906728,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B0009JE6G6,Midge,"[2, 2]","The premise was excellent but the writers turned a great idea into painfully, plodding drivel. The pace was so slow it would try the patience of a saint. While I was an Executive female and thus do not have any objections to females in leadership roles; the female lead in this series was badly written & designed. She is a completely self involved, over protective mother to the point of making the viewers nauseous to watch her constant hovering over her child. This character would allow the entire group to perish in pursuit of her personal agenda as the overprotective mother from hell; bordering on Munchhausens by proxy. Rarely anyone challenges her while she decides their every move.Who would follow someone like this? Although, she wasn't overbearing & egomaniacal like Janeway, her constant tunnel vision focus on her son & total disregard for the group's welfare in favor of her personal idiosyncracies became quite tiresome after 3 or 4 episodes. This may be fine for a PTA president or scout Troop leader but not a leadership role to colonize an alien planet. Frankly, the group should have removed her from her self-assumed leadership position on the first episode. The entire series was all about her personal needs and her forcing her decisions upon the others which usually turns out badly. Terry Quinn would have been a better choice as a group leader instead of the virtual reality villain. His talents were wasted.Then there is the group leaders constantly patronized, frail son Uly whose every waking moment is dominated by his hovering mother. Yet he was repeatedly left unsupervised so he could fall victim to that weeks villain. Too much focus was placed on this weakly designed character. The second child is a girl who constantly causes trouble & weekly near fatalities and never learns her lesson. Yet the adults leave her to wander without supervision where she gets into unending trouble. They finally drop off her behavior issues & plot domination about 1/3 through the series. Her father Danzinger, a cyborg named Yale and Bess (wife of Morgan) are the only salvageable characters of this series. The rest of the cast has practically zero storyline or dialogue.Let us not forget the perpetually wounded pilot and the deranged spy doctor to try the viewers patience for repetition while the group stops their trek to become sitting targets for the ""attack of the week"" perpetrators. Then there is the whining, self-centered coward Morgan who was very irksome to watch. His character was finally redeemed with a better personality about 1/3 into the series.Between the over hovering mother group leader, the Battlestar Galactica trek where they leave pristine, bountiful landscape behind for parched, arid, SW dead, unusable soil & the plodding pace of each episode were clear reasons why any network would have cancelled the series. It was also tiresome watching a lost in space or Battlestar Galactica type of group ground trek to a destination they never reach with a new hazard to battle each week. It was a wearisome formula. It is not necessary to place the cast in peril every week to make a show enjoyable to watch. It is a clear path to series failure. Viewers get tired of it very quickly.Just building a new society on an alien planet with new technology to impress the scifi tech viewers would have created plenty of storyline opportunities. The series filming location should be northern California, not the desert SW. It's amazing the cast could tolerate such an abysmal filming location.The terrians were truly some award winning alien designs. Very unique & believable appearance and the sounds they produced. Best I've were seen on any series... and as a lifelong scifi & star trek fan, that is saying something.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[10, 11]","Earth 2 was a short lived prime time sci-fi series that offered an interesting premise, but was far from original in it's delivery.  Nearly 200 years into the future, Earth has come to the point where it can no longer support life, with remaining humans seeking refuge on orbiting space stations.  Living in sterile environments has led to the birth of a new and deadly virus, which Devon (Debrah Farentino) believes can be cured and mankind saved if our race once again lives in a natural environment.  A planet light years away, which seems very similar to the Earth of old, is the destination of Devon, her infected child, and a crew of families, to which they travel.  The ship however, is sabotaged, and a crash landing ensues, leaving a handful of survivors.  Among them are Devon, the ship's engineer (Clancy Brown), and the pilot (Antonio Sabato, Jr.), most of which do solid work throughout the series.  Of course there are some alien beings to be found, and all doesn't go as well as one would hope for the survivors, but there is something that is oddly likeable about Earth 2.  It never reaches for the originality and witiness of past sci-fi classics like Farscape or even Joss Whedon's short lived Firefly, but then again, it was never given the chance to come into it's own.

Its demise was largely due to the constant shuffling and pre-empting of the show through its timeslots and airing-days; it was so badly shifted around that viewers just couldn't find it to watch it. None-the-less, this show had all the potential and I seriously enjoyed it. Earth2 was basically Wagon Train meets Gilligan's Island meets Lost in Space. A colony ship crashlands on planet G889 (Earth2) but they are in the wrong spot. They must travel across this new planet in order to get to New Pacifica so they can setup for the other 250 families supposedly already enroute to Earth2.The main characters of the Eden Advance Colonists were Devon & Ulysses (Uly) Adair, John & True Danziger, Yale, Morgan & Bess Martin, Alonzo Solace, Dr Julie Heller and in the background were roughly 7-10 other characters that could be used as main characters if the series had continued. There were three species native to the planet that appeared regularly: Grendlers, Terrians, and the little rodent spikers. Unbeknownst to the colonists, this was a place the space stations also sent a multitude of convicts as a prison, the main one appearing early with Tim Curry as Gaal.One of the down spots of the series is the Eden Advance Colony just kept running into humans (convicts, assassins, 'eco-terrorists', crashed ships).On to the actual DVD presentation itself. I like the packaging, the menus are friendly, and there's an assortment of bonus features although I really don't need an episode of Cleopatra 2525 and Sliders included, it makes no sense other than as a blatant marketing ploy to get you the consumer to by those series also. I would have much rather had commentaries about the series by the cast members, what they liked about filming E2, what contributed to its demise, and if they had wished it to continue.The episodes of Earth2 are set up in order of when they aired and unfortunately, the last to episodes on disc4 are chronologically out of order. ""Natural Born Grendlers"" should be viewed after the Gaal storyline (roughly episode 5) and ""Flower Child"" is actually the second to last episode of the series so should be watched before ""All About Eve"", but that's a lot of disc swapping.It's a shame this series wasn't given a proper attempt at being a success, this could have been ""LOST"" only ten years earlier.",5,If it had only found a time slot,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,2432,"['Earth2', 'one', 'shows', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', '5-10', 'seasons', 'met', 'untimely', 'demise', 'one', 'season', 'demise', 'was', 'largely', 'due', 'constant', 'shuffling', 'pre-empting', 'show', 'timeslots', 'airing-days', 'was', 'so', 'badly', 'shifted', 'viewers', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'watch', 'None-the-less', 'show', 'had', 'potential', 'seriously', 'enjoyed', 'Earth2', 'was', 'basically', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'meets', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'Lost', 'Space', 'colony', 'ship', 'planet', 'G889', 'Earth2', 'are', 'wrong', 'spot', 'must', 'travel', 'new', 'planet', 'order', 'get', 'New', 'Pacifica', 'can', 'setup', 'other', '250', 'families', 'supposedly', 'already', 'enroute', 'Earth2.The', 'main', 'characters', 'Eden', 'Advance', 'Colonists', 'were', 'Devon', 'Ulysses', 'Uly', 'Adair', 'John', 'True', 'Danziger', 'Yale', 'Morgan', 'Bess', 'Martin', 'Alonzo', 'Solace', 'Dr', 'Julie', 'Heller', 'background', 'were', 'roughly', '7-10', 'other', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'had', 'continued', 'were', 'three', 'species', 'native', 'planet', 'appeared', 'regularly', 'Grendlers', 'Terrians', 'little', 'rodent', 'spikers', 'Unbeknownst', 'colonists', 'was', 'place', 'space', 'stations', 'also', 'sent', 'multitude', 'convicts', 'prison', 'main', 'one', 'appearing', 'early', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Gaal.One', 'down', 'spots', 'series', 'Eden', 'Advance', 'Colony', 'just', 'kept', 'running', 'humans', 'convicts', 'assassins', ""'eco-terrorists"", 'crashed', 'ships', '.On', 'actual', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'packaging', 'menus', 'are', 'friendly', 'assortment', 'bonus', 'features', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'episode', 'Cleopatra', '2525', 'Sliders', 'included', 'sense', 'other', 'blatant', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'get', 'consumer', 'series', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'rather', 'had', 'commentaries', 'series', 'cast', 'members', 'what', 'liked', 'filming', 'E2', 'what', 'contributed', 'demise', 'had', 'wished', 'continue.The', 'episodes', 'Earth2', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'order', 'when', 'aired', 'unfortunately', 'last', 'episodes', 'disc4', 'are', 'chronologically', 'order', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Grendlers', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'Gaal', 'storyline', 'roughly', 'episode', '5', 'Flower', 'Child', 'actually', 'second', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'Eve', 'lot', 'disc', 'swapping.It', 'shame', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'proper', 'attempt', 'being', 'success', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'LOST', 'only', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier']",Earth 2: The Complete Series

The major thing I felt really pushed it down was that they tried to put to much subplot stories into the series in its first season,  they should have kept with the overall story with just one drama subplot per season so as not to weigh the series down so much.

But, to off-set this, there's a fairly interesting imagination at work inventing new and diverse challenges for our little band of humans lost on a world that works ""differently"" than anything they've known.There are a couple of reasons this show appeals to us.  There's the diversity of the characters.  And there's the allure of outerspace intertwined with a band of human pioneers discovering this new frontier. The unknown (which is what they awake to every day) has always been a big drawing point.While some may believe that the series ended without a final resolve, it might be noted that the humans learn in the last episode that they are useful, if not vital to the planet's future, which is a very positive note to end on.As Amazon.com did package Earth 2 well for shipment, I suspect the original packaging of the manufacterer caused some difficulty in viewing a few of these disks (or it might have been a slight production flaw?).Regardless, Amazon.com made the return a painless and quick event - I can't speak more highly of how they handled my complaint.

906744,A1JVG2EUDNQ3HT,B0009JE6G6,shelly v,"[3, 3]","I recently rediscovered E2 on dvd and realized that even though it hardly made a splash back when it was on in 1994, it's a show that would be more resonant if it were on today considering the latest trends toward creating a more green environment.  Why?  Well, if you've read earlier reviews, by now you know what it's about: not too far into the future, the Earth is all but extinct and humans live on space stations orbiting above Earth.  A lack of an actual earthlike atmosphere leads a mother and her dying son to search for an alternate earthlike planet 22 light years away.  Of course their plan to colonize the new planet goes disastrously wrong when their ship crashes and strands them and their eclectic crew thousands of miles away from their intended destination and they must make their way across an strange planet full of obstacles.This show had a ton of potential.  When it hit its notes right, it was like the classic Twilight Zone:  a good dollop of science fiction, action, a bit of humor, some good drama and/or romance all packaged together with some insight into the human condition (""The Enemy Within"", ""Redemption"", ""Better Living Through Morganite part 2"").  It tackled many environmental issues effectively but still entertainingly, such as conservation of natural resources and the question of superiority of humans over animals and alien life (""Water"", ""Survival of the Fittest"").  But of course it's not perfect.  Some of the episodes are brilliant, others are schmaltzy or pale imitations of cheesy horror and scifi movies (""After the Thaw"", ""The Greatest Love Story Never Told"").  Notable actors include Jessica Steen as Dr. Julia Heller, career villain actor Clancy Brown (playing the good guy for once) as John Danziger, and my favorite, the funny and talented John Gegenhuber playing the whiny but occasionally sweet Morgan Martin.  But I don't think there is a weak link in any of the cast (even the child actors were good).  All in all, I was and am still sad that it left off on a cliffhanger that was never resolved because it was cancelled after season 1.

906746,ANM9NWZSNSQ9Q,B0009JE6G6,Theresa Flynn,"[6, 8]","Given the hostile territory for Sci-Fi/Fantasy on network television, it's amazing this show got an airing at all, much less an entire season.  For the Sci-Fi fan, this will make a nice, if frustrating, addition to their collection (a cliff-hanger ending and no fan novels to complete that which was left unanswered).  With low-tech and a familiar premise (humans colonizing an, oops, populated alien planet) this series ages relatively well (but takes place a good deal of time after the description's date of 2192!).  Gathering elements from the Frank Herbert book, ""Dune"" and striking an eerie resemblance to the popular new TV series ""Lost"" (Terry O'Quinn was a featured guest), it does what Sci-Fi does well.  Instead of focusing on the aliens or the technology, it asks how we, as humans, remain human in the face of aliens and technology -- or do we revise that which we call ""human?""  When a friend asked if the aliens were good or bad, I had to tell her to watch the series.  The choice to have lots of ""grey area"" and complex issues gave this series the potential for an intriguing, if unrealized, future.  If there are any stumbles, it would be the typical ones brought about by network demands for mass palatability.  Attempts at romance fall flat.  The ""gorgeous woman/dork"" pairing of Rebecca Gayheart and John Gegenhuber is as unbelievable as that combination is on the plethora of TV sitcoms today.  Debrah Farentino and Clancy Brown actually seem to have negative chemistry, owing in no small part to the strident and frequently irritating tone written for her character.  The only pairing that seems to come close to working is Jessica Steen and Antonio Sabato, Jr.  While he is pretty enough for any woman to get worked up about, Ms. Steen's performance is subtle and layered, and therefore infinitely more believable.  The kid factor is a pain early on, but the producers wisely tone that down after the first few episodes.  Guest stars like Tim Curry and Virginia Madsen make for intriguing mysteries when the core group needs energizing.  On a last note, DVD producers need to think about the order that they place episodes in for DVD release.  Typically, they go for broadcast order.  In this case, that is a huge mistake - not only because of the sequential nature of the series, but because world events (the first gulf war) pre-empted critical episodes which were ""dumped"" at the end of the season when it was clear the show would not be renewed.  The episode listed as 19 (""All About Eve"") is actually the finale.  The two episodes after that ""Natural Born Grendlers""/ep 20 and ""Flower Child""/ep 21 should be watched in sequence (20 would fall sometime between eps 04 and 06, 21 is most likely the ""real"" 18).",4,Worth a Visit,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,2736,"['Given', 'hostile', 'territory', 'Sci-Fi/Fantasy', 'network', 'television', 'amazing', 'show', 'got', 'airing', 'much', 'less', 'entire', 'season', 'Sci-Fi', 'fan', 'will', 'make', 'nice', 'frustrating', 'addition', 'collection', 'cliff-hanger', 'ending', 'fan', 'novels', 'complete', 'was', 'left', 'unanswered', 'low-tech', 'familiar', 'premise', 'humans', 'colonizing', 'oops', 'populated', 'alien', 'planet', 'series', 'relatively', 'well', 'place', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'description', 'date', '2192', 'Gathering', 'elements', 'Frank', 'Herbert', 'book', 'Dune', 'striking', 'eerie', 'resemblance', 'popular', 'new', 'TV', 'series', 'Lost', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'was', 'featured', 'guest', 'what', 'Sci-Fi', 'well', 'Instead', 'focusing', 'aliens', 'technology', 'how', 'humans', 'remain', 'human', 'face', 'aliens', 'technology', 'do', 'revise', 'call', 'human', 'When', 'friend', 'asked', 'aliens', 'were', 'good', 'bad', 'had', 'tell', 'watch', 'series', 'choice', 'have', 'lots', 'grey', 'area', 'complex', 'issues', 'gave', 'series', 'potential', 'intriguing', 'unrealized', 'future', 'are', 'stumbles', 'would', 'be', 'typical', 'ones', 'brought', 'about', 'network', 'demands', 'mass', 'palatability', 'Attempts', 'romance', 'fall', 'flat', 'gorgeous', 'woman/dork', 'pairing', 'Rebecca', 'Gayheart', 'John', 'Gegenhuber', 'as', 'unbelievable', 'combination', 'plethora', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'today', 'Debrah', 'Farentino', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'actually', 'seem', 'have', 'negative', 'chemistry', 'owing', 'small', 'part', 'strident', 'frequently', 'irritating', 'tone', 'written', 'character', 'only', 'pairing', 'come', 'close', 'working', 'Jessica', 'Steen', 'Antonio', 'Sabato', 'Jr', 'pretty', 'enough', 'woman', 'get', 'worked', 'up', 'about', 'Ms.', 'Steen', 'performance', 'subtle', 'layered', 'therefore', 'infinitely', 'more', 'believable', 'kid', 'factor', 'pain', 'early', 'producers', 'wisely', 'tone', 'down', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'make', 'intriguing', 'mysteries', 'when', 'core', 'group', 'energizing', 'last', 'note', 'DVD', 'producers', 'need', 'think', 'order', 'place', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'release', 'Typically', 'go', 'broadcast', 'order', 'case', 'huge', 'mistake', 'not', 'only', 'sequential', 'nature', 'series', 'world', 'events', 'first', 'gulf', 'war', 'pre-empted', 'critical', 'episodes', 'were', 'dumped', 'end', 'season', 'when', 'was', 'clear', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'renewed', 'episode', 'listed', '19', 'Eve', 'actually', 'finale', 'two', 'episodes', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Grendlers', '/ep', '20', 'Flower', 'Child', '/ep', '21', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'sequence', '20', 'would', 'fall', 'sometime', 'eps', '04', '06', '21', 'most', 'likely', 'real', '18']",Earth 2: The Complete Series

With the planet little more than a dead rock in space with orbiting space stations supporting the bulk of the surviving population of the planet,  Devon Adair (Debrah Farentino) pays for an expedition to a recently charted Earth-like planet 22 light years away when a mysterious illness begins to slowly kill her son Ulysses. When the ship crash lands thousands of miles away from its intended landing area these explorers find themselves stranded on the wrong side of their new home.Led by Devon and John Danzinger (the marvelous Clancy Brown who also does the cartoon character voice for Mr. Krabbs on ""Spongebobsquarepants"", the videogame voice for Dr. Neo Cortex in the ""Crash Bandicoot"" games and appeared in the classic film ""The Shawkshank Redemption"" among many others) on the long difficult journey,  these settlers encounter a number of  rather unpleasant native life forms including Grendlers and a race called the Terrians. The Terrians can sprout out of the ground instantly like weeds which and appear threatening at first. They also seem to have some sort of psychic link to both Ulysses  (Joey Zimmerman) and the pilot of the Alonzo (Antonio Sabato Jr).""Earth 2"" always reminded me of ""Lost in Space"" during it's first season with its story of a group of colonists trapped on an alien world and at the mercy of its environment. No series like this would be complete without its own Dr. Smith and we get one in the form of Morgan Martin (John Gegenhuber). A thoughtful, well written show that used the science fiction genre as a parallel of the settlement of the American West, ""Earth 2"" received the short end of the stick with NBC yanking and moving the series around so often on their Sunday night schedule that fans finally gave up trying to find the series. That's too bad as the ensemble cast had just started to gel and the series began to pick up steam mid-stream suggesting a lot of interesting developments in the story arc developed for the show.Although the network DID express some interest in bringing the show back, evidently NBC wanted to retool the show making it more of an action-adventure series. I'm guessing but I suspect they also would want to recast many of the key roles for the series as well. Perhaps it's just as well the series didn't survive into a second season although fans were cheated out of a resolution to the grand finale of season one.A stellar transfer for ""Earth 2"" is a highlight of the series. There's minimal dirt and debris to mar the marvelous picture seen here. The images are bright with vivid colors. There are occasional issues with edge enhancement and other digital artifacts but the presentation is quite pleasing. The 2.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound has nice presence and with the sound nicely placed around the speakers. Sadly, this is presented on two dual layered, dual sided discs and the holder won't protect them very well. I'd suggest picking up some DVD holders to prevent scratching and wear & tear.We don't get any featurettes or vintage interviews in the set which is a bit of a surprise. We do get deleted and extended scenes however and a blooper reel of outtakes from the series' first and only season. There's also a cross promotional effort going on with this set as it includes an episode of the cheesy and fun series ""Cleopatra 2525"" and an episode from ""Sliders: The Complete 3rd Season"" entitled ""Rules of the Game"". The episode of ""Cleopatra 2525"" ""Quest for Firepower"" is the pilot from the series created by Robert Tappert and R.J. Stewart (""Hercules"", ""Xena""). Although the series didn't last more than a season, it did revive the career of ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" star Gina Torres (as well as ""The Matrix Revolutions"" and ""The Matrix Reloaded"") who first got her start on the cult series ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" back in 1994. Image quality of the pilot episode of the series is very good although the effects appear a bit cheesy even by the standards of the year 2000.""Rules of the Game"" is one of the best episodes from the third season of the Fox cult series ""Sliders"" which quickly declined in quality as writer/co-creator and co-producer Tracy Torme left the series after conflict with the Fox network and was replaced by writer/producer/director David Peckinpah who radically retooled the show killing off a major character (and eventually getting rid of a second major character) and generally recreating the series in his vision.Sadly, there's no commentary from any of the cast members or the producers/writers/directors. That's too bad as some extras might have helped this boxed set to sell a bit better. Many fans of the series have probably recorded it onto DVD or video from the airing it had on the Sci-Fi Channel and in its brief syndicated run.A very nicely done set from Universal, ""Earth 2"" looks and sounds exceptionally good on DVD. While extras are limited, the ones provided are nice although fans would probably have liked a few featurettes that focused on the creation of the show and what the producers were planning for the series during the unproduced second season.",4,Fascinating adventure cut short by NBC,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,5115,"['future', 'Earth', 'toast', 'planet', 'little', 'more', 'dead', 'rock',

906753,AFZNJHDGE0DUJ,B0009JE6G6,Zadius Sky,"[1, 1]","For some reason, ""Earth 2"" recently emerged in my mind and I had had not thought of this show for over 15 years. Such an urge/signal drove me to purchase this series, which is consisted of only 22 episodes (with additions of two episodes from other shows, including ""Sliders""). I surely remembered this series as a teenager and recall how excited I was to have seen it but I did not know that it only lasted for a year. Thinking back on it, I found what was appealing to me about this show was an idea of ""starting over"" on a new planet and discarding ""old habits"" that one was used to on the futuristic stations. The ""Earth"" that they knew before arriving was in such a bad, deteriorating state (i.e., acid rains).""Earth 2"" is about the journey and settlement of a small group called the Eden Project (led by Devon Adair), with a plan make a trip to an Earth-like planet called G889 with a hope to find a cure to ""the syndrome."" Adair's son, Uly, was healed by a native group called the Terrians, who have a symbiotic relationship with the planet and was able to communicate with the colonists by a way of dreaming. They also plan to create a new colony called New Pacifica before an arrival of 200+ families. However, there's an insidious governmental group whom were ever watchful and tried to control over the colonists was known as the Council, who have their own agenda for the planet. This show seemed to have a strong exploration of Gaia hypothesis.Personally, I've enjoyed this sci-fi show, which is pretty standard of its time, and I am glad to have watched it again.I have looked up on some of the actors, whom I am familiar with and others I have little knowledge of. It is very sad to find that J. Madison Wright (who played a little girl True Danziger) died in 2006 and Sullivan Walker (who played cyborg Yale) died in 2012 - both of heart attack.",5,An Enjoyable Show,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1861,"['reason', 'Earth', '2', 'recently', 'emerged', 'mind', 'had', 'had', 'not', 'thought', 'show', '15', 'years', 'urge/signal', 'drove', 'purchase', 'series', 'consisted', 'only', '22', 'episodes', 'additions', 'two', 'episodes', 'other', 'shows', 'including', 'Sliders', 'surely', 'remembered', 'series', 'teenager', 'recall', 'how', 'excited', 'was', 'have', 'seen', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'only', 'lasted', 'year', 'Thinking', 'back', 'found', 'what', 'was', 'appealing', 'show', 'was', 'idea', 'starting', 'over', 'new', 'planet', 'discarding', 'old', 'habits', 'one', 'was', 'used', 'futuristic', 'stations', 'Earth', 'knew', 'arriving', 'was', 'such', 'bad', 'deteriorating', 'state', 'i.e.', 'acid', 'rains', 'Earth', '2', 'journey', 'settlement', 'small', 'group', 'called', 'Eden', 'Project', 'led', 'Devon', 'Adair', 'plan', 'make', 'trip', 'Earth-like', 'planet', 'called', 'G889', 'hope', 'find', 'cure', 'syndrome', 'Adair', 'son', 'Uly', 'was', 'healed', 'native', 'group', 'called', 'Terrians', 'who', 'have', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'planet', 'was', 'able', 'communicate', 'colonists', 'way', 'dreaming', 'also', 'plan', 'create', 'new', 'colony', 'called', 'New', 'Pacifica', 'arrival', '200+', 'families', 'However', 'insidious', 'governmental', 'group', 'whom', 'were', 'ever', 'watchful', 'tried', 'control', 'colonists', 'was', 'known', 'Council', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'agenda', 'planet', 'show', 'seemed', 'have', 'strong', 'exploration', 'Gaia', 'hypothesis.Personally', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'pretty', 'standard', 'time', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'watched', 'again.I', 'have', 'looked', 'up', 'actors', 'whom', 'am', 'familiar', 'others', 'have', 'little', 'knowledge', 'very', 'sad', 'find', 'J.', 'Madison', 'Wright', 'who', 'played', 'little', 'girl', 'True', 'Danziger', 'died', '2006', 'Sullivan', 'Walker', 'who', 'played', 'cyborg', 'Yale', 'died', '2012', 'heart', 'attack']",Earth 2: The Complete Series

I liked it right from the start, but over the years my memory of the show had faded to just a fond memory. So I'm very glad to see this show FINALLY released to DVD.After re-watching the pilot episode I was surprised at how well the story and special effects held up. That first episode carried with it such great potential for a TV series, but I dont think that people were ready for a show like this back in 1994. While re-watching it I kept thinking about how this show tried to give us a story that was more reality driven. Today we have shows like Battlestar Galactica, Lost, and even the short lived Firefly that have all become highly regarded for using the same formula.I believe that if this show had primered in 2004-2005 it would have been much better recieved, but sadly it was cancelled, and thanks to the fans dedication they have finally released these DVD's.
