435860,A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW,6304796277,John K. Reed,"[7, 10]",First off let me take my hat off to the producers becasue Lauren Holly and Jill Henessy were lookin' too fine in this picture.  Particularly Jill Henessy was just off da hook!  That was almost enough just to see her.  When she came into that restaurant in that red dress...  Smokin'.Ok.  So the movie was pretty light.  There are still some pretty entertaining scenes.  When they go to the fertility clinic and Greg Kinnear's efforts to get back to San Francisco from Seattle were both pretty funny.For a really funny look at 'trying' to get pregnant I recommend She's Having a Baby with Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern.  Hillarious!,3,Predictable but entertaining,988243200,"04 26, 2001",2001,636,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'take', 'hat', 'producers', 'becasue', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'Jill', 'Henessy', 'were', 'lookin', 'too', 'fine', 'picture', 'Particularly', 'Jill', 'Henessy', 'was', 'just', 'off', 'da', 'hook', 'was', 'almost', 'enough', 'just', 'see', 'When', 'came', 'restaurant', 'red', 'dress', ""Smokin'.Ok"", 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'light', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'When', 'go', 'fertility', 'clinic', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'efforts', 'get', 'back', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Seattle', 'were', 'pretty', 'funny.For', 'really', 'funny', 'look', ""'trying"", 'get', 'pregnant', 'recommend', 'Having', 'Baby', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'Hillarious']",Smile Like Yours VHS

KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[2, 3]","I enjoy a good romance film as much as the next person, but this dreadful film is so forced that I could barely sit through it. Greg Kinnear who is usually very good is flat as a pancake along with his irritating co-star Lauren Holly. There are a few scattered moments (mostly from Joan Cusack), but not not nearly enough to get this awful film off the ground. I rate it 1 1/2 stars because I was somehow able to sit through this lazy comedy with no romance to be found.",1,NOT MUCH TO SMILE ABOUT HERE! 1 1/2 STARS!,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,470,"['enjoy', 'good', 'romance', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'dreadful', 'film', 'so', 'forced', 'could', 'barely', 'sit', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'who', 'usually', 'very', 'good', 'flat', 'pancake', 'irritating', 'co-star', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'are', 'few', 'scattered', 'moments', 'mostly', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'not', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'get', 'awful', 'film', 'ground', 'rate', '1', '1/2', 'stars', 'was', 'somehow', 'able', 'sit', 'lazy', 'comedy', 'romance', 'be', 'found']",Smile Like Yours VHS
