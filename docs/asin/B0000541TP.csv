We get a peek inside the deteriorating relationship of two couples (well, in one case, the couple never really 'teriorated' in the first place), anchored by a pair of sisters.I'm sure we're seeing extreme cases, but if Gitai is trying to make a point of unmasking the inherent male chauvinism of this corner of the faith, then he's accomplished it successfully.  The sisters - obviously bright, thoughtful individuals - are treated merely as baby-carrying vessels here.

No, Gitai holds no punches.Two sisters, Rivka (Yael Abecassis) and Malka (Meital Barda) are trapped in this male-dominated society. Rivka has not been able to bear children for her husband Meir (Yoram Hattab) and, according to a direct quote from the Talmud itself, a barren woman is no better than a dead woman. Malka, meanwhile, can not marry the man she loves but must marry the ultra-orthodox Yossef (Uri Ran Klausner) who believes that the only role women play in today's world is that of producing more Jewish men.In a brilliant stroke, director Gitai explores the ruinous ramifications of such a belief system by focusing almost solely on the impact it causes to the sexual lives of these two young subjugated women -- incredibly sweet and beautiful love scenes are juxtaposed with one of the most repugnant and mechanical sex scenes in recent memory, which drives home the sad point that the only purpose of marriage is to allow cold, painful intercourse which itself is necessary only for the propagation of the faction.",4,"Sex, religion and politics",978048000,"12 29, 2000",2000,1329,"['beautifully', 'constructed', 'ultimately', 'depressing', 'essay', 'endless', 'pain', 'suffering', 'caused', 'blind', 'allegiance', 'doctrine', 'tradition', 'Israeli', 'director', 'Amos', 'Gitai', 'relentlessly', 'critical', 'eye', 'stiflingly', 'ultra-orthodox', 'segment', 'Jewish', 'population', 'modern-day', 'Jerusalem', 'No', 'Gitai', 'punches.Two', 'sisters', 'Rivka', 'Yael', 'Abecassis', 'Malka', 'Meital', 'Barda', 'are', 'trapped', 'male-dominated', 'society', 'Rivka', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'bear', 'children', 'husband', 'Meir', 'Yoram', 'Hattab', 'according', 'direct', 'quote', 'Talmud', 'barren', 'woman', 'better', 'dead', 'woman', 'Malka', 'meanwhile', 'can', 'not', 'marry', 'man', 'must', 'marry', 'ultra-orthodox', 'Yossef', 'Uri', 'Ran', 'Klausner', 'who', 'only', 'role', 'women', 'play', 'today', 'world', 'producing', 'more', 'Jewish', 'men.In', 'brilliant', 'stroke', 'director', 'Gitai', 'ruinous', 'ramifications', 'such', 'belief', 'system', 'focusing', 'almost', 'solely', 'impact', 'sexual', 'lives', 'two', 'young', 'subjugated', 'women', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'one', 'most', 'repugnant', 'mechanical', 'sex', 'scenes', 'recent', 'memory', 'home', 'sad', 'point', 'only', 'purpose', 'marriage', 'allow', 'cold', 'painful', 'intercourse', 'necessary', 'only', 'propagation', 'faction']",N/A
566376,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0000541TP,Dennis Littrell,"[16, 18]","There are some thoughtful and well-written reviews both at Amazon and the IMDb and elsewhere in which it is claimed that the type of Jewish Orthodoxy presented here is not accurate.  There are quibbles about the unnatural way that Meir puts on his garments.  There is criticism of the selection of prayers recited, especially Meir giving thanks that he was not born a woman.  Moreover, there is the assertion that orthodox Judaism does NOT require that a man repudiate his wife after ten years of marriage even though she may be barren.  Furthermore, the character of Yossef is said not to be typical of orthodox Jewish men since he takes his wife sexually without love or tenderness, that he hits her when angry, and goes about the streets of Israel with a loudspeaker hawking his religious point of view.First, it is a shame (if true) that the way Meir dressed and recited his morning prayers was inaccurate, because such details can easily be made accurate with some research.  Certainly director Amos Gitai had access to many orthodox people who could have helped him.  Putting that aside, the artistic point of the opening scene was to immerse the viewer into a world based on religious beliefs and practices that are strikingly different from the secular world of today.  He also wanted to introduce his theme, which is that women in Orthodox Judaism, as in the other two great religions of the Middle East, in their fundamentalist interpretations--this bears repeating: in their fundamentalist interpretations--are not on an equal level with men.  Certainly in a realistic sense, Meir, since he dearly loves his wife, would have chosen something else to recite.  However, I think we can give Gitai some artistic license here.  The fact that such a prayer exits in the Jewish canon is not to be denied.Second, the film does NOT claim that Orthodox Judaism requires that a man repudiate his wife after ten years of childless marriage.  Instead it makes the very strong point that, from the point of view of Orthodox Judaism, such a woman is not fulfilling her role in society, and that there will be people outside the marriage who will try to persuade him to abandon her.  Gitai's screenplay contains several textual pronouncements to that effect.  The fact that Meir is torn between his love for his wife and his love for his religion is really the point.  How he resolves that dilemma is an individual choice, and that is what the film shows.As for the unflattering character of Yossef, whom Rivka's sister Malka is persuaded to marry (not forced, mind you, but persuaded) he is a foil and a counterpoint for the loving and deeply religious Meir.  The fact that he is not a poster boy for Orthodox Judaism is not a valid criticism of the film, since all religions have their black sheep.I think a fairer criticism of the film can be made by addressing the question of, was it entertaining and/or a work of art?Here I have mixed feelings.  Certainly the acting was excellent, and the theme a worthy one.  Gitai's desire to show the underlying similarities among the conservative expressions of all three Abrahamic religions, through their shared patriarchal attitudes toward women and their estrangement from the postmodern world, was very well taken and appropriate.  Where I think Gitai failed as film maker is in his inability to be completely fair to the orthodox way of life--his failure to show the joys as well as the sorrows of its everyday life which would help outsiders to understand why people adhere to such a way of life.I also think that the film could have been better edited.  In the documentary about how the film was made we see scenes that were cut that I think should have been retained, especially the scene in which the omelette was made and the scene in which the mother critiques the life choices her three daughters have made.  Instead we have some scenes that ran too long.  It is a fine technique that Gitai sometimes employs of letting the silence speak for the characters, of holding the camera on the scene to allow the audience to reflect and then to reflect again.  However, I think this can be overdone and was overdone, and that judicious cutting of some of the scenes would have strengthened the movie.Bottom line: a slow polemic of a movie that nonetheless is worth seeing because of the importance and timeliness of its theme, the originality of some of the techniques, and the fine acting, especially by Yael Abecassis who played Rivka and Meital Barda who played Malka.One more point: yellow subtitles, please!",3,"What is ""sacred""?",1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,4557,"['are', 'thoughtful', 'well-written', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'IMDb', 'elsewhere', 'claimed', 'type', 'Jewish', 'Orthodoxy', 'presented', 'here', 'not', 'accurate', 'are', 'quibbles', 'unnatural', 'way', 'Meir', 'garments', 'criticism', 'selection', 'prayers', 'recited', 'especially', 'Meir', 'giving', 'thanks', 'was', 'not', 'born', 'woman', 'Moreover', 'assertion', 'orthodox', 'Judaism', 'NOT', 'require', 'man', 'repudiate', 'wife', 'ten', 'years', 'marriage', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'barren', 'Furthermore', 'character', 'Yossef', 'said', 'not', 'be', 'typical', 'orthodox', 'Jewish', 'men', 'wife', 'sexually', 'love', 'tenderness', 'when', 'angry', 'streets', 'Israel', 'loudspeaker', 'hawking', 'religious', 'point', 'view.First', 'shame', 'true', 'way', 'Meir', 'dressed', 'recited', 'morning', 'prayers', 'was', 'inaccurate', 'such', 'details', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'accurate', 'research', 'Certainly', 'director', 'Amos', 'Gitai', 'had', 'access', 'many', 'orthodox', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'Putting', 'aside', 'artistic', 'point', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'world', 'based', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'practices', 'are', 'strikingly', 'different', 'secular', 'world', 'today', 'also', 'wanted', 'introduce', 'theme', 'women', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'other', 'two', 'great', 'religions', 'Middle', 'East', 'fundamentalist', 'interpretations', 'repeating', 'fundamentalist', 'interpretations', 'are', 'not', 'equal', 'level', 'men', 'Certainly', 'realistic', 'sense', 'Meir', 'wife', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'something', 'else', 'recite', 'However', 'think', 'can', 'give', 'Gitai', 'artistic', 'license', 'here', 'fact', 'prayer', 'Jewish', 'canon', 'not', 'be', 'denied.Second', 'film', 'NOT', 'claim', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'man', 'repudiate', 'wife', 'ten', 'years', 'childless', 'marriage', 'Instead', 'very', 'strong', 'point', 'point', 'view', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'such', 'woman', 'not', 'fulfilling', 'role', 'society', 'will', 'be', 'people', 'marriage', 'who', 'will', 'try', 'persuade', 'abandon', 'Gitai', 'screenplay', 'several', 'textual', 'pronouncements', 'effect', 'fact', 'Meir', 'torn', 'love', 'wife', 'love', 'religion', 'really', 'point', 'How', 'dilemma', 'individual', 'choice', 'what', 'film', 'shows.As', 'unflattering', 'character', 'Yossef', 'whom', 'Rivka', 'sister', 'Malka', 'persuaded', 'marry', 'not', 'forced', 'mind', 'persuaded', 'foil', 'counterpoint', 'loving', 'deeply', 'religious', 'Meir', 'fact', 'not', 'poster', 'boy', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'not', 'valid', 'criticism', 'film', 'religions', 'have', 'black', 'sheep.I', 'think', 'fairer', 'criticism', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'addressing', 'question', 'was', 'entertaining', 'and/or', 'work', 'art', 'Here', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Certainly', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'theme', 'worthy', 'one', 'Gitai', 'desire', 'show', 'underlying', 'similarities', 'conservative', 'expressions', 'three', 'Abrahamic', 'religions', 'shared', 'patriarchal', 'attitudes', 'women', 'estrangement', 'postmodern', 'world', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'taken', 'appropriate', 'Where', 'think', 'Gitai', 'failed', 'film', 'maker', 'inability', 'be', 'completely', 'fair', 'orthodox', 'way', 'life', 'failure', 'show', 'joys', 'as', 'well', 'sorrows', 'everyday', 'life', 'would', 'help', 'outsiders', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'adhere', 'such', 'way', 'life.I', 'also', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'edited', 'documentary', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'see', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'retained', 'especially', 'scene', 'omelette', 'was', 'made', 'scene', 'mother', 'life', 'three', 'daughters', 'have', 'made', 'Instead', 'have', 'scenes', 'ran', 'too', 'long', 'fine', 'technique', 'Gitai', 'sometimes', 'letting', 'silence', 'speak', 'characters', 'holding', 'camera', 'scene', 'allow', 'audience', 'reflect', 'then', 'reflect', 'again', 'However', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'overdone', 'was', 'overdone', 'judicious', 'cutting', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'strengthened', 'movie.Bottom', 'line', 'slow', 'polemic', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'worth', 'seeing', 'importance', 'timeliness', 'theme', 'originality', 'techniques', 'fine', 'acting', 'especially', 'Yael', 'Abecassis', 'who', 'played', 'Rivka', 'Meital', 'Barda', 'who', 'played', 'Malka.One', 'more', 'point', 'yellow', 'subtitles', 'please']",N/A
566377,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B0000541TP,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[11, 20]","I'm writing this as a Roman Catholic who viewed the film as an educational piece as well as the usual reasons for seeing a movie.  I'm aware that my own religion has it's own quirks when viewed by those outside the religion.  The prominent one that connects with this film is that Catholic women have no avenue to power in the Church hierarchy.  It is so pronounced the I recently heard Conservative broadcaster Sean Hannidy, a Catholic himself, talk about his feelings on religious topics.  While he said he could consider married men into the priesthood, he wasn't one of those feminists that want abortion and women priests to be part of the religion.  Putting both of these topics on equal footing in the same sentence shows that my own religion has a long way to go itself.I'm also aware that the Jewish religion as practiced by those in the movie are in the minority.  Even the Orthodox in America probably don't go to such extremes.  But the fact remains that in one part of the world, this is the way people interpret that God wants it, and even if the minority, it is still accepted by some, and makes for a fascinating look at religion.These folks, it would seem, have a prayer for everything they do.  There are prayers not only for putting clothes on, but different ones for different articles of clothing.  There are prayers one does on one's wedding night.  And all of this is set around seemingly spending one's day studying prayer itself.This, of course, is what the men do.  It is clearly stated that a woman's job is to keep a home clean, cook meals for hubby, and engage in her only joy, which is raising children.  They don't even seem to share in the celebration of the religion.The director definitely has a burr in his side about this type of life.  These are not the Jews of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Yentl"", who sing and dance a lot to cope with their misery.  The Jews in this film lead what seem to be very dreary lives, and none seem happy even though they go along with it.A wedding (and a wedding night) are portrayed with all the joy of a visit to the dentist.  The groom does not even look at his bride during the ceremony, and as soon as the glass is broken, he immediately begins dancing with all his other male buddies, while the bride is led away from the ""festivities"".The wedding night is one of the most painful scenes you'll see in movies.  The bride laughs and cries at the same time as she cuts her own hair short.  The groom has his prayers to say, of course, at the bed.  Part of these seem to include a homage to his new bride.  This comes across about as romantic as telling her she has an attractive mop when she cleans house.  Their consummation shows that neither of them really have any idea what love and marriage are all about.OK, it's extreme, and I've seen people scream that that's not the way it is.  That's probably true for most Jews, but the fact is, it PROBABLY does exist in the minds of enough people that it became the topic of a film.  And I do believe that this goes on.  My own religion has their cloistered nuns, who spend their entire lives devoid of stimulation.  I notice there are not cloistered priests, and of course these nuns will never, ever make a decision on how the church operates.I thank the director for showing me this world.",5,Fascinating glimpse into a hidden world,1037059200,"11 12, 2002",2002,3309,"[""'m"", 'writing', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'who', 'viewed', 'film', 'educational', 'piece', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'reasons', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'m"", 'aware', 'own', 'religion', 'own', 'quirks', 'when', 'viewed', 'religion', 'prominent', 'one', 'film', 'Catholic', 'women', 'have', 'avenue', 'power', 'Church', 'hierarchy', 'so', 'pronounced', 'recently', 'heard', 'Conservative', 'broadcaster', 'Sean', 'Hannidy', 'Catholic', 'talk', 'feelings', 'religious', 'topics', 'said', 'could', 'consider', 'married', 'men', 'priesthood', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'feminists', 'want', 'abortion', 'women', 'priests', 'be', 'part', 'religion', 'Putting', 'topics', 'equal', 'footing', 'same', 'sentence', 'shows', 'own', 'religion', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'itself.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'aware', 'Jewish', 'religion', 'practiced', 'movie', 'are', 'minority', 'Even', 'Orthodox', 'America', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'such', 'extremes', 'fact', 'one', 'part', 'world', 'way', 'people', 'interpret', 'God', 'even', 'minority', 'still', 'accepted', 'fascinating', 'look', 'religion.These', 'folks', 'would', 'seem', 'have', 'prayer', 'everything', 'do', 'are', 'prayers', 'not', 'only', 'putting', 'clothes', 'different', 'ones', 'different', 'articles', 'clothing', 'are', 'prayers', 'one', 'one', 'wedding', 'night', 'set', 'seemingly', 'spending', 'one', 'day', 'studying', 'prayer', 'itself.This', 'course', 'what', 'men', 'do', 'clearly', 'stated', 'woman', 'job', 'keep', 'home', 'clean', 'cook', 'meals', 'hubby', 'engage', 'only', 'joy', 'raising', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'share', 'celebration', 'religion.The', 'director', 'definitely', 'burr', 'side', 'type', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'Jews', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', 'Yentl', 'who', 'sing', 'dance', 'lot', 'cope', 'misery', 'Jews', 'film', 'lead', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'dreary', 'lives', 'none', 'seem', 'happy', 'even', 'go', 'along', 'it.A', 'wedding', 'wedding', 'night', 'are', 'portrayed', 'joy', 'visit', 'dentist', 'groom', 'not', 'even', 'look', 'bride', 'ceremony', 'as', 'soon', 'glass', 'broken', 'immediately', 'dancing', 'other', 'male', 'buddies', 'bride', 'led', 'away', 'festivities', '.The', 'wedding', 'night', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movies', 'bride', 'cries', 'same', 'time', 'own', 'hair', 'short', 'groom', 'prayers', 'say', 'course', 'bed', 'Part', 'seem', 'include', 'homage', 'new', 'bride', 'across', 'as', 'romantic', 'telling', 'attractive', 'mop', 'when', 'house', 'consummation', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'love', 'marriage', 'are', 'about.OK', 'extreme', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'scream', 'not', 'way', 'probably', 'true', 'most', 'Jews', 'fact', 'PROBABLY', 'exist', 'minds', 'enough', 'people', 'became', 'topic', 'film', 'do', 'believe', 'own', 'religion', 'cloistered', 'nuns', 'who', 'spend', 'entire', 'lives', 'devoid', 'stimulation', 'notice', 'are', 'not', 'cloistered', 'priests', 'course', 'nuns', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'make', 'decision', 'how', 'church', 'operates.I', 'thank', 'director', 'showing', 'world']",N/A

It looks nearly impossible for them to live fulfilling and joyous lives. The film has a universal message which can apply to any religion or community which influences and advises its members in personal life matters that are, in this viewer's opinion, best left to be determined for one's self. In this film, two sisters lose their self-determination and are sadly compelled to follow the norms of the community ... just because they are women ... whose roles are proscribed. They are to obey the man and be dependent rather than self-determining individuals. The community is run by men who define behavioral norms based on passages from the Torah. The rabbi interprets how these passages are to be understood in modern life. The community influences the lives of its members to a degree most viewers would find highly objectionable and down right intrusive. Whether or not this is a truthful depiction of the Hasidic way of life is unclear to this viewer but the point which is crystal clear by the director is that some areas of life are *indeed* *sacred* and are no one's business but one's own. This is a totally compelling and fascinating film in how it unravels, unbalances and destroys the lives of an apparently happily married couple who are childless after 10 years of marriage. Both Meir, the husband, and Rivka, the wife, are heart-broken after the rabbi at the Yeshiva compels Meir to consider divorcing Rivka in favor of an arranged marriage ... to produce offspring ... evidently his ""sacred"" duty to G-d. It is not at all clear why *only* Rivka is blamed for this flaw ...The klezmer music at the beginning and throughout much of the film proclaims the joys of life and its meandering mournful paths as well ... the sadder tunes reveal the future anguish of Meir and Rivka as they sort out their problems within the expectations of their religion. Sadly, Malka who is Rivka's sister is not looking forward to an arranged marriage to Yosef because Malka has a boyfriend Yakov who had left the Yeshiva and religious community to pursue a secular life. He sang a haunting tune in a nightclub about how love can not be fulfilled in this world but instead he will  meet his lover in the next one ... Malka obeys her parents and marries Yosef but her marriage life is a sham despite going to ritual baths to become spiritually more clean and praying as required. She follows her heart and breaks her sacred marriage bond by secretly meeting with Yakov for a tryst. The film shows Yosef to be an unthinking and insensitive man which is not entirely his fault but he is also brutish which again, he may not be able to change. He entered into a marriage for the wrong reasons - just as Malka became an obedient daughter rather than showing courage and breaking with tradition to do what is in her own best interests to follow her heart and mind ... even if it meant being banished from the Hasidic community. This film does indeed film less than joyful moments in the lives of its characters, the clothes and colors worn by the women, the older brick buildings and narrow passageways in the streets ... all are symbolic of a lifestyle which makes the insides of its members crumble and breakdown ... Who should decide in the final analysis of what is important in life? Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",4,What Is Truly Sacred?

We soon learn the painful personal ""truth"" behind this bit of humor, as Meir and his wife Rivka get lost between love and the demands of the strictly religious community they live in.Kadosh (""sacred"") depicts the sacrifice of individualism in the name of the common good, and the kind of resistance a human being feels in a world of ""suffocation.""  Rivka and her younger sister Malka are like victims in a society where individuals have no personal space or even persona but are supposed to act and think alike.  I don't think this is only about the oppression of women -- although the film does seem to emphasize that alleged part of Orthodox Judaism a lot, fairly or not -- but it applies to the men as well.  Meir, the scholar, is a victim of his fellow scholars' behind-the-back gossip.  Yakov is a victim of being ostracism after he became secularized.  Even the religious fanatic, Youssef, is a kind of victim, too, that of a rigid system which permits no individualistic thinking or behavior.  When he, on the wedding night, tells Malka that he likes the way she walks, he sounds like an embarrassed boy who doesn't know how to act in front of a girl.  But, in a masterful stroke, the film then shows he clumsily but forcefully consummates the marriage, in a scene that's both funny and shocking.The film flows in a slow pace and in an almost monotonous way, which is the impression most outsiders have of the orthodox Jewish way of life.  The use of many indoor scenes further darkens one's perception of this ""other world,"" a world so unfamiliar to most of us living in the West.  There's almost a constant sense of frustration the audience might feel as the film progresses.  We feel for Rivka and Malka, and we also feel their hopelessness at times.  They are almost like two typical teenagers raised in a strict family: both want to rebel, but the older feels she must save the honor of the family, while the younger feels she must break free.  Again, it's not just the women: when Meir tries to resist the rabbi's urging to divorce his wife, and when he gets drunk one night and breaks into Rivka's room, he's showing a rebellious side, too.",4,Individuals vs. community,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,2323,"['beginning', 'Israeli', 'film', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Meir', 'Orthodox', 'Jewish', 'scholar', 'thanks', 'morning', 'prayer', 'God', 'not', 'created', 'woman', 'soon', 'learn', 'painful', 'personal', 'truth', 'bit', 'humor', 'Meir', 'wife', 'Rivka', 'get', 'lost', 'love', 'demands', 'strictly', 'religious', 'community', 'live', 'in.Kadosh', 'sacred', 'sacrifice', 'individualism', 'name', 'common', 'good', 'kind', 'resistance', 'human', 'being', 'feels', 'world', 'suffocation', 'Rivka', 'younger', 'sister', 'Malka', 'are', 'victims', 'society', 'where', 'individuals', 'have', 'personal', 'space', 'even', 'persona', 'are', 'supposed', 'act', 'think', 'alike', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'only', 'oppression', 'women', 'film', 'seem', 'emphasize', 'alleged', 'part', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'lot', 'fairly', 'not', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'Meir', 'scholar', 'victim', 'fellow', 'scholars', 'behind-the-back', 'gossip', 'Yakov', 'victim', 'being', 'ostracism', 'became', 'secularized', 'Even', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'Youssef', 'kind', 'victim', 'too', 'rigid', 'system', 'individualistic', 'thinking', 'behavior', 'When', 'wedding', 'night', 'Malka', 'way', 'embarrassed', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'act', 'front', 'girl', 'masterful', 'stroke', 'film', 'then', 'clumsily', 'forcefully', 'marriage', 'scene', 'funny', 'shocking.The', 'film', 'flows', 'slow', 'pace', 'almost', 'monotonous', 'way', 'impression', 'most', 'outsiders', 'have', 'orthodox', 'Jewish', 'way', 'life', 'use', 'many', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'further', 'one', 'perception', 'other', 'world', 'world', 'so', 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'living', 'West', 'almost', 'constant', 'sense', 'frustration', 'audience', 'might', 'feel', 'film', 'feel', 'Rivka', 'Malka', 'also', 'feel', 'hopelessness', 'times', 'are', 'almost', 'two', 'typical', 'teenagers', 'raised', 'strict', 'family', 'want', 'rebel', 'older', 'feels', 'must', 'save', 'honor', 'family', 'younger', 'feels', 'must', 'break', 'free', 'Again', 'not', 'just', 'women', 'when', 'Meir', 'resist', 'rabbi', 'urging', 'divorce', 'wife', 'when', 'drunk', 'one', 'night', 'breaks', 'Rivka', 'room', 'showing', 'rebellious', 'side', 'too']",N/A

This movie drags on, two hours of anti-Orthodox propaganda (one of the sisters is forbidden to marry an observant Jew who joined the Israeli army; a rabbi rants about conquering ""them,"" meaning secular Israeli Jews; men go on and on about women's worthlessness without children, while the women sigh and moan and are generally downtrodden).Another reviewer has said director Gitai ""holds no punches""... but I'd prefer to think of it as outright lying. What uneducated viewers might see as a compellingly authentic portrait of ultra-Orthodox life is nothing more than a web of misconceptions, preconceptions and half-conceptions about what ""that kind of life"" must be like -- as seen from the outside. Its only authenticity comes from its use of the Hebrew language -- and even with my limited knowledge of Hebrew, I could tell that many of the prayers (the wedding service, for example) were inaccurate or taken out of context.Gitai's men are stereotypes, chanting prayers at all hours of the day and night, while the two sisters stare lingeringly at the camera as if to say, ""pity me -- for I am an Orthodox woman."" Feminism has shown us -- at least -- that women have the power to choose their own destiny. This movie denies that premise, denies the free will of all Orthodox Jews, denies virtually every premise on which true Judaism is based.I don't consider myself an apologist for Orthodoxy, and if you've read my other reviews, you'll know (I hope) that I have a fairly good handle on its flaws... but it hurts to hear and see such lies about any of my people.

The rebellion of the younger sister is not only the rebellion of the feminine, it can be a symbol of rebellion against authority.To the end, we all do things for the sake of our individual interests. If the female rebel was sexually happy with her husband, would she eb rebellious? If the Rivka character were pregnant, would she find her situation unbearable? I don't think so.

Yet, none can deny the plight of the repressed women of the movie.Eternal power conflict between male and female also found its expression in this beautiful work.It deserves five star for its excellent photography, scripts and all actors were simply superb.However, one forgets that not everyone in secular societies is happy either.Watch it, you will be touched, and may also be disturbed a bit.",5,"Powerful movie, five star for the artistic quality, although message can be contoversial",1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,1698,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'often', 'empathized', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'Jewish', 'culture', 'kind', 'repression', 'anywhere.I', 'agree', 'one', 'very', 'low-star', 'reviewer', 'not', 'corners', 'orthodox', 'communities', 'are', 'rife', 'unhappiness', 'secularism', 'magic', 'pill.Too', 'many', 'factors', 'are', 'involved', 'biology', 'history', 'technology', 'social', 'mechanics', 'bit', 'bit', 'unison', 'Movie', 'can', 'only', 'cover', 'fraction', 'can', 'never', 'hold', 'reality', 'whole', 'rather', 'can', 'hold', 'part', 'reality', 'frame', 'Same', 'here.The', 'director', 'produce', 'did', 'awesome', 'job', 'depicting', 'sorrow', 'social', 'prison', 'men', 'women', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'rebellion', 'rebellion', 'younger', 'sister', 'not', 'only', 'rebellion', 'feminine', 'can', 'be', 'symbol', 'rebellion', 'end', 'do', 'things', 'sake', 'individual', 'interests', 'female', 'rebel', 'was', 'sexually', 'happy', 'husband', 'would', 'eb', 'rebellious', 'Rivka', 'character', 'were', 'pregnant', 'would', 'find', 'situation', 'unbearable', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'character', 'conservative', 'community', 'was', 'repressive', 'doubt', 'not', 'all.Yet', 'theme', 'honest', 'soul', 'always', 'desire', 'be', 'free.Often', 'unhappiness', 'origins', 'when', 'compare', 'others', 'none', 'can', 'deny', 'plight', 'repressed', 'women', 'movie.Eternal', 'power', 'conflict', 'male', 'female', 'also', 'found', 'expression', 'beautiful', 'work.It', 'five', 'star', 'excellent', 'photography', 'scripts', 'actors', 'were', 'simply', 'superb.However', 'one', 'forgets', 'not', 'everyone', 'secular', 'societies', 'happy', 'either.Watch', 'will', 'be', 'touched', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'disturbed', 'bit']",N/A

Filmed with excruciating attention to detail, the daily rituals and total immersion in the faith are deeply explored.The word &quot;Kadosh&quot; means sacred and this film is basically the love stories of two sisters who are trapped in this very constricting world. Rifka, the older sister, is sweetly in love with her husband of ten years. There is deep and gentle feeling between them and they take joy in each other.  Problem is, they have no children, and according to Orthodox law, the husband must take another wife. Malka, the younger sister, cannot marry the former soldier and guitar player who she loves because he has left the community.  She becomes the victim of an arranged marriage to a brutal over-zealous fundamentalist who I can only characterize as a religious nut-job.  The wedding night is horrendous and depicted with startling detail and I found myself crying.  I saw this film in a theater, and when I glanced at the woman sitting next to me, she was crying too.The writer and director, Amos Gitai, is a secular Israeli and is clearly depicting Orthodox Jews in a negative way.  I wish the film would be more balanced.  Surely, there are people who live that way without the sad unhappiness that permeates this film.  Several years ago I read a novel called &quot;The Romance Reader&quot; by Pearl Abraham.  It, too, was about the restrictions imposed in her small Hasidic community.  However, not everyone saw the restrictions the same way, and there was a lot of love and caring in the community.Most of this film was shot indoors, in apartments and synagogues with crumbling walls.  I wondered if there was even plumbing in the buildings. Other scenes showed the crowded winding streets of Jerusalem packed with traffic.  Some of the scenes were also a little too long for my taste.  But the director certainly did capture the anguish of these two women as they struggled in their own ways to deal with their lives.The atmosphere throughout is sad and morose but I do recommend this video.

Their haunting unhappiness with their lot in life makes them transparent. You can see their hearts slowly break as they go about the business of life.Set in the ultra-Orthodox quarter of Jerusalem called Mea Shearim, ""Kadosh"" (meaning ""sacred"") studies two sisters, Rivka and Malka, enduring the ironhanded restrictions of their tiny, airtight society. Director Gitai fastidiously features the endless rituals of the sisters lives: everything from how tea is taken to how love is made.  Then one day someone sends a note to Rivka, happily and lovingly married to Meir for ten years...but childless, stating ""A woman without a child is no better than dead."" And thus begins the forced and tragic separation of Rivka and Meir.Malka is younger than Rivka and questions everything about the Orthodox way. She is also in love with a Mea Shearim deserter, Yaakov (Sami Hori) but is forced into a loveless, arranged marriage with a blustering bully: the scene of their first night of marriage is brutal and frankly disgusting with Malka's beautiful spirit and life force seemingly extinguished in the process.""Kadosh"" is very still, very quiet, claustrophobic.

The actors (themselves secular Israelis) love the challenge of playing fundamentalist ultra-Orthodox Jews and manage to convey a true pathos for the characters and their lives.

The writer/director makes clear in his dvd interview: Orthodox Judaism and the Talmud are, according to him, clearly out to debase women. He chooses the most anti-woman quotations from the Talmud (certainly using a search engine) and composes a plot and shallow fundamentalists to mouthe the lines. In the interview, he claims all monotheistic religions are by nature anti-woman [unlike the Greeks, Romans, Assyrians, Egyptians,... ???] and that fundamentalists are people too shallow &quot;to experience spirituality in the world without ritual&quot; as he does.

Epstein ""asanisimasa""","[14, 23]","I had mixed feelings about this film but I think it's important to explain that there is a difference between the Orthodox Judaism that is practiced here in America (and probably most other countries) and the Orthodox Judaism that is practiced in Israel. There, it is the most fundamental type of orthodoxy that one can find. It is not imposed that a man must divorce his wife if she cannot bear children, but the pressures are very real. In America, if an orthodox woman wasn't able to get pregnant, the family would not turn their back on the possibility that it might be the man who is sterile. In fact, most of the events we see in this film would not happen in our society. Nevertheless, the misogynist words that men say every morning in their prayers, the fact that women are considered 'unclean' and untouchable during menstruation and so on, is part of all orthodox Jewish belief. Ironically, many of the viewpoints of women in the orthodox Jewish religion are very similar to those of the beliefs in fundamentalist Islam (thankfully, orthodox Jews do not castrate women!). I think this film has valid viewpoints on fundamentalism. The film isn't anti-Semitic, it is humanistic. Orthodox women in Israel are terribly mistreated. They know that to leave their community means losing family and all that they've ever known. They are brainwashed like all people who are told not to question their religion, that they would be turning their back on God. Thus, they take their pain out on themselves instead of their community. Many people tend to look the other way when one brings up the misogyny present in Orthodox Judaism. Would they do so if the tables were turned and it was women who thanked God they were not born a man and considered their men unclean several days of the month and so on? If one race subjugated another the way women are subjugated in most fundamentalist religions, there would be a major outcry the world over, but most people tend to feel that subjugation of a woman is basically okay. In the name of 'religion', it is never questioned. No religion is bad, but any community that does not allow one to question the rules of a religion is very, very dangerous, be it Jewish, Muslim or Christian. I find it sad that people in the Jewish community can't accept any form of criticism about a branch of their religion that does exist in parts of the world. This is not a great film from an artistic viewpoint, but it is obviously an important eye opener for people who have a belief that Judaism, as well as all religions, should be balanced and humane. If you don't like what you see, criticize those people who even allow the philosophy that women are inferior beings into their religions. Those roots are there, everywhere!

566400,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0000541TP,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","Having no knowledge about the inner workings of the Jewish Orthodox community, I was intrigued by some of the works I have come across. First, I readHush, a novel which touches on the abuses against children in the Jewish Orthodox community. I have also watchedArrangedwhich explores the lives of two young women living in orthodox communities, one is Jewish and the other is Muslim. Though both the book and movie portray the dark side of orthodox communities, there is objectivity in the portrayal, and it doesn't come across as an outright attack against orthodoxy.When I saw ""Kadosh"" on Netflix, I was initially attracted by the premise, which explores the relationship of a happily married Jewish Orthodox couple. Both Meir and his wife Rivka have been happily married for the past ten years. The only blight on their marriage is the fact that they are childless. This torments Rivka, a devout and faithful wife who feels it is her duty to provide Meir with children and she feels awful because she realizes that Meir is subject to his fellow yeshiva colleagues' disdain because he is unable to have a family. When Meir's Rabbi father insists that Meir take another wife, things spiral downwards very quickly. Rivka is shattered, and when a visit to a doctor reveals that she is not at fault for her barren marriage, she feels worse, but is unable to challenge the Rabbi's decision given his word is law. Then there's the sub-plot of Rivka's younger sister Malka. Beautiful and strong-willed, Malka has a secular Jewish boyfriend who was ostracized by the Orthodox community when he left to join the army. Malka's life too is portrayed as being oppressed and ruined by the Rabbi who marries her off to a brutish yeshiva student named Yossef. Despite being subjected to violent and awkward sex, she appears to tolerate her life until she hears of Rivka's fate.Not being overly familiar with the rituals and life of the Orthodox Jews, I cannot comment on the accuracy of the portrayal here. What captivated me was the intense performances of all the leads in this movie - Rivka and Malka are well-portrayed by the two actors who play these characters, there is a depth of emotion that connects the viewers to the two characters and makes us sympathize with their plights. The men in this movie appear to be secondary characters,to serve as props for the women's stories. I did sense a strong and virulent bias against the orthodox community in this film, and I'm not even Jewish. On the whole though, this was a compelling drama and it would have been a lot more credible if the director had maintained objectivity in telling the story.",3,"Compelling acting by the leads, but...",1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,2639,"['Having', 'knowledge', 'inner', 'workings', 'Jewish', 'Orthodox', 'community', 'was', 'intrigued', 'works', 'have', 'come', 'First', 'readHush', 'novel', 'abuses', 'children', 'Jewish', 'Orthodox', 'community', 'have', 'also', 'watchedArrangedwhich', 'lives', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'living', 'orthodox', 'communities', 'one', 'Jewish', 'other', 'Muslim', 'book', 'movie', 'portray', 'dark', 'side', 'orthodox', 'communities', 'objectivity', 'portrayal', ""n't"", 'come', 'across', 'outright', 'attack', 'orthodoxy.When', 'saw', 'Kadosh', 'Netflix', 'was', 'initially', 'attracted', 'premise', 'relationship', 'happily', 'married', 'Jewish', 'Orthodox', 'couple', 'Meir', 'wife', 'Rivka', 'have', 'been', 'happily', 'married', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'only', 'blight', 'marriage', 'fact', 'are', 'childless', 'Rivka', 'devout', 'faithful', 'wife', 'who', 'duty', 'provide', 'Meir', 'children', 'awful', 'Meir', 'subject', 'fellow', 'yeshiva', 'colleagues', 'disdain', 'unable', 'have', 'family', 'When', 'Meir', 'Rabbi', 'father', 'Meir', 'take', 'wife', 'things', 'spiral', 'downwards', 'very', 'quickly', 'Rivka', 'shattered', 'when', 'visit', 'doctor', 'not', 'fault', 'barren', 'marriage', 'worse', 'unable', 'challenge', 'Rabbi', 'decision', 'given', 'word', 'law', 'Then', 'sub-plot', 'Rivka', 'younger', 'sister', 'Malka', 'Beautiful', 'strong-willed', 'Malka', 'secular', 'Jewish', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'was', 'ostracized', 'Orthodox', 'community', 'when', 'left', 'join', 'army', 'Malka', 'life', 'too', 'portrayed', 'being', 'oppressed', 'ruined', 'Rabbi', 'who', 'off', 'brutish', 'yeshiva', 'student', 'named', 'Yossef', 'being', 'subjected', 'violent', 'awkward', 'sex', 'tolerate', 'life', 'Rivka', 'fate.Not', 'being', 'overly', 'familiar', 'rituals', 'life', 'Orthodox', 'Jews', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'accuracy', 'portrayal', 'here', 'What', 'captivated', 'was', 'intense', 'performances', 'leads', 'movie', 'Rivka', 'Malka', 'are', 'well-portrayed', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'characters', 'depth', 'emotion', 'viewers', 'two', 'characters', 'sympathize', 'plights', 'men', 'movie', 'appear', 'be', 'secondary', 'characters', 'serve', 'props', 'women', 'stories', 'did', 'sense', 'strong', 'virulent', 'bias', 'orthodox', 'community', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'Jewish', 'whole', 'though', 'was', 'compelling', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'credible', 'director', 'had', 'maintained', 'objectivity', 'telling', 'story']",N/A

According to the Orthodox Jewish law? This is not true! There is no such thing in today's Jewish Orthodox life.I am wondering how those people produced this movie in Israel (!) without even making a simple research on the subject. An American movie ""Stranger Among us"" and a European masterpiece ""Left Luggage"" engaged much more knowledge about ultra-Orthodox Jews than this Israeli movie! Is not it funny? What a shame!And who cares about performance? Who cares if this movie is touching or not? The movie is lie from start to finish.
