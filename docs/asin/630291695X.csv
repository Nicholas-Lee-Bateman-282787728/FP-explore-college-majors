In this delightful romp through the days when things were simple, Jay and Artie go to Grandma's and gets lost with so much comings and goings.  Aunt Gert talks funny and Bella is the the belle of the ball in every aspect.  She takes the two young boys to the ice cream shop in the brownstone where WBXX is up on the roof.  She gets all dressed up with white gloves and shoes and hat and has big dreams of getting out of the rat race and having too take care of Momma like she has since the age of twelve.  She wants to get married (""I gotta love somebody who'll love me back before I die."") and falls in love with a gangster.Their uncle Louie is corrupt in a good way; his big yellow convertible is stolen while Artie is trying to run away from home.  Louie goes around with his mysterious little black bag acting like Humphrey Bogart and even talks like him (Keep your dukes up.)  The boys enjoy watching adult situations they don't understand while their dad is out somewhere trying to find a home for them.  Bella has a forty-year-old friend who is the usher at the movies who is illiterate but has a great personality; he needs $5,000 to open up a restaurant where she will be the bookkeeper.  You've got to see Bella in the short yellow dress.  She is told ""You can make it on your own, it just takes moxie.""  They drink the original Coca-Cola and we will soon know the caffeine content in each Coke product.  It's that new Coke Blak which is too strong for public consumption.Bella is as strong as an ox and says ""You don't scare me anymore, Ma.""  I first saw the play of LOST IN YOUNKERS at a smalltown theater in Fayetteville, Tennessee, and loved to look at theyoung fellow who played Artie.  He even sounded like a Yankee.  Uncle Louie decides to come to Bella's rescue and in the meantime shows the boys that they need to stop depending on people; you can be lost anywhere, so go out and find your own fortune.

It is a slice of life in the 1940's....America is at war. And we are invited to step inside the life of a family struggling for survival...not from the threat of a foriegn enemy, but from the cold fury and bitterness that shaped it's earliest beginnings. It is the story of one woman's engrained anger with her life, and how it altered and damaged her surviving adult children. Don't let me undermined it's moments and situations filled with good humor. They're present, no doubt. But it is the serious moments and their meaning that drives this story to the very heart of you, and claims a place in your memory long after the credits scroll down the screen. It is that kind of a film. The most important, moving, amazing, and ironically uplifting look into their lives, comes from the victory of love and goodness over anger and bitterness...how that same love and goodness shields and protects one adult child's life from being touched or damaged by them. Bella. The youngest surviving daughter. The one whose victory of spirit is unexpected. She is the only adult child not scarred by her mother. If you aren't careful, it will pass in front of you without being seen. But, it's there. She is said to be ""forever a child"". She is believed to be too child like in mind to be wise, forgiving, tolerant, or forebearing. But she is all of those things. This is Bella's story really. Take the time to see one of the most powerful....quiet, and rewarding movies on film. Richard Dryefuss dazzles you with his insight into the character he plays.

There's nothing wrong with Dreyfuss's performance, in fact he's very funny as a George Raft style gangster reined in by the domestic prison of his family. It's just that the aforementioned ladies are SO good that you are constantly watching them to see what they will do next.This wartime story centres round two boys whose father sends them to live with their grandmother so he can repay a debt. There's an air of tragedy throughout this comic film. The debt is the hospital expenses of the boys' dead mother, and much of the film is spent dwelling on this and other deaths in the family. But Neil Simon does it so well, and the comedic moments do not in any way lessen the impact of the more melancholy scenes.

345397,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,630291695X,Genevieve Hayes,"[1, 5]","In the 1940's, two young boys, Jay and Artie, are sent by their father to live with their cold-hearted grandmother (Irene Worth) and kind but slow aunt Bella (Mercedes Ruehl), in Yonkers. Things look grim for the boys, until their uncle Louie (Richard Dreyfuss), a small-time gangster, shows up and livens up their otherwise dull lives.Given the fact that (a) ""Lost in Yonkers"" is written by Neil Simon, a man famous for writing comedies, such as ""The Odd Couple""; (b) the posters/cover artwork for ""Lost in Yonkers"" makes it look like a comedy; and (c) the DVD case actually describes this film as a comedy, you could be forgiven for mistaking ""Lost in Yonkers"" for a comedy. It's not. There are one or two laughs in ""Lost in Yonkers"", but one or two jokes does not make a comedy. ""Lost in Yonkers"" is, in fact, the most serious Neil Simon movie that I have seen.Simon won the Pulitzer Prize for the play upon which this film was based and while watching it, I couldn't help but feeling that Simon was deliberately aiming for such a prize while writing it. It is as if Simon were deliberately trying to press all the right buttons in the judges - a coming of age story; morality issues; mentally-challenged characters; family; the search for love. It's all here. Obviously the judges fell for Simon's plan, hook, line and sinker, but as an ordinary audience member, I just came away feeling emotionally manipulated. At the end of the film, I didn't see characters such as Bella and the grandmother as real people, I saw them as contrived vehicles for critic-pleasing monologues.I believe Neil Simon is a great playwright, in fact, I see him as one of the great playwrights of the 20th century. Through his Eugene Jerome plays (in particular, ""Biloxi Blues""), Simon demonstrated that it is possible to write an entertaining comedy that touches on serious issues. Yet, Simon doesn't do that here. He gives us the issues without the comedy. As a result, ""Lost in Yonkers"" is the first Neil Simon film/play I have seen that I haven't enjoyed.

This movie didn't dissapoint me. Aunt Bella, played by Mercedes Ruehl, is one of Neil Simon's strongest and most well rounded characters. She is handicapped by her early bout with scarlet fever and, as a result, remains part child while feeling all the emotions and needs of a normal thirty-five year old woman. Miss Ruehl never becomes campy or phoney. Once you understand Bella's psychological conflict, completely beyond her control, you marvel at how the character becomes more and more endearing as she progresses from one incident after another with her truly abrasive mother who is the polar opposite of Bella. The plot of the story is strong and never overpowers the inherent humor in the human drama being played out by the two boys, their uncle Louis, and all of the other characters.

Richard Dreyfuss played a classic fast-talking ganster. Jay and Arty were portrayed perfectly, while I was even afraid of the grandmother. The chillingly sad atmosphere of the play is brightened by Bella's never ending kindness and Arty's wonderful one liners.Though not as true to the play as it could have been, for a movie adaption, it was very well done.",5,A classic version of the classic play.,990403200,"05 21, 2001",2001,495,"['movie', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'version', 'Neil', 'Simons', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Mercedes', 'Reuhl', 'sweet', 'not', 'simple', 'Bella', 'was', 'stunning', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'played', 'classic', 'fast-talking', 'ganster', 'Jay', 'Arty', 'were', 'portrayed', 'perfectly', 'was', 'even', 'afraid', 'grandmother', 'chillingly', 'sad', 'atmosphere', 'play', 'brightened', 'Bella', 'never', 'ending', 'kindness', 'Arty', 'wonderful', 'one', 'liners.Though', 'not', 'true', 'play', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'adaption', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Excellent performances from the rest of the cast as well. I saw this play on Broadway,and the film remained pretty true to it; I just missed the impact a live performance has- comic timing is affected by the audience during a live performance,and film just doesn't have that capability.",5,Great adaptation of Neil Simon's play,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,403,"['love', 'got', 'Irene', 'Worth', 'Mercedes', 'Ruehl', 'reprise', 'Tony', 'Award-winning', 'roles', 'film', 'version', 'Excellent', 'performances', 'rest', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'saw', 'play', 'Broadway', 'film', 'remained', 'pretty', 'true', 'just', 'missed', 'impact', 'live', 'performance', 'has-', 'comic', 'timing', 'affected', 'audience', 'live', 'performance', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'capability']",N/A
