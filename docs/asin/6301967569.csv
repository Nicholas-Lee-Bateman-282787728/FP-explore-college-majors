279051,A1UX6GTMKEH98J,6301967569,"Anne ""Eclectic Bookworm""","[37, 38]","This is a movie based somewhat loosely on Edna Browning Kahly Gladney, who successfully lobbied the Texas Legislature to take the word ""illegitimate"" off of birth certificates.  She also wanted to ensure adopted children the same inheritance rights of other children and better living conditions for all diadvantged children in the states care.  This is a wonderful, mainly fictional movie that tells the story of a woman courageous enough to take on the state of Texas so that children could be adopted into homes that may not have wanted them if they knew they were ""creatures of shame"".I wish more people knew the real story behind sealed adoption records so that those who want to keep them close could no longer twist Mrs. Gladney's story to suit their agenda.  In the early 20th century records had to be sealed so that ALL children could have the possibility of being accepted into good, loving homes and have the same rights as other children.Adoption records were sealed to protect children then and now if an adult adoptee wants their records they should be able to get them, unless the birth parent(s) have asked that they not be opened.  Over the last eight decades medical knowledge has improved dramatically and letting adoptees have their records could potentially save their life (I speak from experience, not mine but a very special person that might be alive if they had been able to get their records before they were terminally ill.  They had asked for them more than 10 years before they were diagnosed and was denied, more than once.  What is so astonishing is that once they were diagnosed as terminal, they could get the records that were denied.  Too little, too late, to save them; it's just wrong (IMHHO)).  In keeping records sealed, states are potentially sentencing innocent people to death because they cannot get their records to see if they or their future children are at risk for anything.I love Greer Garson and wish they would do a Greer Garson Collection and/or a Greer Garson & Walter Pidgeon Collection.  She is one of my favorite actresses, I love all her movies.  She was great in everything she did, but I love every movie she did with Walter Pidgeon.

279062,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6301967569,Kevin Killian,"[6, 6]","--of Greer Garson's many films with Walter Pidgeon.  Greer Garson was an odd sort of movie star.  For one thing she always seemed to be about 10 years older than the parts she was cast in, making me wonder if maybe she lied about her age when Louis B. Mayer first found her in the UK.  (Mayer had made one last scouting trip to Europe right before war broke out, and sailed back home not only with Greer Garson but with Hedy Lamarr in another stateroom!  Not a bad haul!)  She had to be lit carefully otherwise her long face took on the aspect of a friendly horse.  And once she was established in Hollywood, she displaced Norma Shearer as the ""queen of the MGM lot,"" effectively kicking Norma upstairs and into retirement, but basically because Mayer was tired of catering towards Shearer and he saw Garson as the ideal replacement.In BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST we see something of the way she might really have looked, for she was born to act in Technicolor, and the compositions of the furnishings, costumes and even the interior decoration are all astonishinly lovely.  For its day, BLOSSOMS was sort of a scandalous picture.  I suppose MGM felt it could get away with a pinch of ""naughtiness"" if they had Garson to give that naughtiness the ""ladylike"" touch she was famous for.  Another of her Pidgeon pictures was actually titled, ""SCANDAL AT SCOURIE.""  In real life, she was responsible for two scandals, she married her own ""son"" (the actor who had played her son in MRS MINIVER), and also going on and on and on for the world's longest acceptance speech when she picked up the Oscar for the same film.  Her speech in BLOSSOMS to the Texas legislature is long, but watching it you can see why Americans loved her.  She represented a fantasy of England, a fantasy so broadly based that she could play a Texan (Edna Gladney), preposterous as it seems, and get away with it, just as she later got away with playing Madame Curie (!!)The story is sentimental but we don't watch Greer Garson movies for slapstick value nor for biting social commentary, we watch them to provoke tears which she always does, simply and certainly as cutting up an onion.

279070,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6301967569,Randy Keehn,"[2, 5]","I become a pretty big fan of Greer Garson over the last few years.  I expected to be impressed with her role in ""Blossoms in the Dust"" as well as with the movie itself.  I hate to admit it but I thought that this was a mediocre movie and I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt by giving it a rating of ""3 stars"".  The problem with the movie is that everything is designed to make the most impact in the least amount of time.  I don't believe I ever saw a movie where each and every scene was designed to either educate, shock, enrage, or endear.  I realize that motion pictures are about taking a 400 page book and turning it into a 110 minute film.  In order to be so concise, every scene needs to be, by necessity, elemental to the overall film.  However, great movies lure us into the emotions it wants to create in us.  Great movies give us the sense that we have been swayed by our own abilities to see through the surface to the hidden meaning within.  Great movies don't create a cast made up of saints and demons with few falling in between.  Great movies don't shove us from scene to scene.  This is not a great movie.There are some fairly decent aspects to its' credit.  I still like the acting of Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon.  The color and cinematography are excellent.  It's just too much of an emotional roller coaster; not for me but for the cast.  There's a sister who handles sudden dispair in an extreme manner in less than a minute.  There's our heroine who one minute can't stand kids and the next (alright, that's a bit of an exaggeration on my part) can't stand to be without them.  There are loving parents to be and an occassional coniving parent that was.  There are all kinds of different kids including some who are illegitimate; a term that is never really dealt with.  I sympasize with the cause of deleting illegitimacy from birth records.  This was, perhaps, the biggest issue that our heroine, Edna Kahly Gladney, took on.  I saw a birth certificate the other day from that era.  There was no father's name on it and the recorder made sure to put a ""Miss"" in front of the mother's name.  Other birth records of the same version in that era just showed names without titles.  I'm glad she took it on the cause of eliminating such designations as ""illegitimate"" on children's birth certificates.  I'm just sorry that the picture only managed about 5 minutes in which to fit the issue into the movie.""Blossoms in the Dust"" ought to be a real tear-jerker and a quick review of some other reviews shows that it was for many  viewers.  However, there was never enough time spent establishing an emotional attachment to give real feelings to a subsequent detachment.  A scene towards the end gives us an Edna that is ready to flee everything in the middle of the night, sacrificing all she's built from the ground up.  The reason was clear but not clearly convincing.  Two minutes later all is well.  I had learned long before that scene not to invest my emotions in any particular part of this movie.  After all, it was obvious that neither the writer nor director had done so either.",3,Blossoms in need of Dusting,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,3114,"['become', 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'expected', 'be', 'impressed', 'role', 'Blossoms', 'Dust', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'hate', 'admit', 'thought', 'was', 'mediocre', 'movie', ""'m"", 'giving', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'giving', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'problem', 'movie', 'everything', 'designed', 'make', 'most', 'impact', 'least', 'amount', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ever', 'saw', 'movie', 'where', 'scene', 'was', 'designed', 'educate', 'shock', 'enrage', 'endear', 'realize', 'motion', 'pictures', 'are', 'taking', '400', 'page', 'book', 'turning', '110', 'minute', 'film', 'order', 'be', 'so', 'concise', 'scene', 'be', 'necessity', 'elemental', 'overall', 'film', 'However', 'great', 'movies', 'lure', 'emotions', 'create', 'Great', 'movies', 'give', 'sense', 'have', 'been', 'swayed', 'own', 'abilities', 'see', 'surface', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'Great', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'cast', 'made', 'saints', 'demons', 'few', 'falling', 'Great', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'shove', 'scene', 'scene', 'not', 'great', 'movie.There', 'are', 'fairly', 'decent', 'aspects', 'credit', 'still', 'acting', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'color', 'cinematography', 'are', 'excellent', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'not', 'cast', 'sister', 'who', 'sudden', 'dispair', 'extreme', 'manner', 'less', 'minute', 'heroine', 'who', 'one', 'minute', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'kids', 'next', 'alright', 'bit', 'exaggeration', 'part', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'be', 'are', 'loving', 'parents', 'be', 'occassional', 'coniving', 'parent', 'was', 'are', 'kinds', 'different', 'kids', 'including', 'who', 'are', 'illegitimate', 'term', 'never', 'really', 'dealt', 'sympasize', 'cause', 'deleting', 'illegitimacy', 'birth', 'records', 'was', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'issue', 'heroine', 'Edna', 'Kahly', 'Gladney', 'took', 'saw', 'birth', 'certificate', 'other', 'day', 'era', 'was', 'father', 'name', 'recorder', 'made', 'sure', 'put', 'Miss', 'front', 'mother', 'name', 'Other', 'birth', 'records', 'same', 'version', 'era', 'just', 'showed', 'names', 'titles', ""'m"", 'glad', 'took', 'cause', 'eliminating', 'such', 'designations', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'birth', 'certificates', ""'m"", 'just', 'sorry', 'picture', 'only', 'managed', '5', 'minutes', 'fit', 'issue', 'movie', 'Blossoms', 'Dust', 'ought', 'be', 'real', 'tear-jerker', 'quick', 'review', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'many', 'viewers', 'However', 'was', 'never', 'enough', 'time', 'spent', 'establishing', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'give', 'real', 'feelings', 'subsequent', 'detachment', 'scene', 'end', 'Edna', 'ready', 'flee', 'everything', 'middle', 'night', 'sacrificing', 'built', 'ground', 'up', 'reason', 'was', 'clear', 'not', 'clearly', 'convincing', 'Two', 'minutes', 'later', 'well', 'had', 'learned', 'long', 'scene', 'not', 'invest', 'emotions', 'particular', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'obvious', 'writer', 'director', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'either']",Blossoms in the Dust VHS

Through her own tragedies such as the suicide of her adopted sister who had no last name and the death of her own baby, she triumphed to help many children in need. She made it so that women who worked and could not care for their children during the day could keep them instead of giving them up for adoption. She also ran a successful orphanage.Greer Garson stars in this film, a plain, standard version of a good woman. There is nothing outstanding about her personality.There are several points in this film that the acting seems forced such as during long periods of laughter and during times of play. These artificial scenes hinder the film.This film was written by Anita Loos, a notorious scandalous film writer of the 1920s. It is surprising to see that she also did family dramas.The big disappointment about this film is that nothing really seems to happen. If you read the back of the box, you know what is going to happen and you watch it simply come to life. However, the story is not exciting enough to really make much of an impact. This is old news.

279075,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301967569,Simon Davis,"[27, 27]","So states Greer Garson in this stunningly put together masterpiece, the type of moving production not seen in Hollywood these days.The film marked the first of the eight legendary teamings of Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon and even though their effort of the following year &quot;Mrs. Miniver' is probably the most famous, here they are both in their prime and Greer delivers what I honestly feel is her best performance. She plays Edna Gladney a real life woman from Fort Worth Texas who was responsible for setting up the famous Texas Children's Home and Aid Society.&quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot;, which refers to the little infants playing in the Texan dust, chronicles her life from the tragic suicide of her foster sister Charlotte who is revealed to be a foundling prior to her marriage, to her own  her marriage to Sam Gladney (Pidgeon), a wheat grower from Texas, through their life together, the tragic loss of their own son, to her widowhood and her wonderful work with the unwanted infants in Texas. It is a totally inspiring account of her struggles to overcome prejudice and break down bureacracy and importantly to have the word &quot;illegitimate&quot; stricken from official records and birth certificates. The famous statement exclaimed by Greer Garson during her campaign &quot;there is no such thing as an illegitimate child, only illegitimate parents&quot; will definately stay with you long after the film has ended and I feel it gives all of us food for thought on this matter.As stated before Greer Garson is the heart and soul of this production. The 1940's witnessed her golden age of stardom in such unforgettable MGM films as &quot;Goodbye Mr. Chips&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, &quot;When Ladies Meet&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot;, and &quot;Valley of Decision&quot; What a marvellous list of classics which makes you wonder just what is Hollywood really doing these days! Greer displays such total warmth in the role but at the same time is quite commanding as Edna begins her personal crusade to right this terrible wrong against orphans making her a believable character. I like the way that at times Edna displays a slight selfish streak which is wonderfully honest and how any of us would react in situations like the moving interlude when she must part with little Tony near the conclusion of the film. Her chemistry with Walter Pidgeon, as always is magical and they made up one of the most enduring screen teams in Hollywood history . Their interactions are a delight to witness and it is easy to see that they were close friends in real life as well so convincing is their working with each other. Felix Bressart so wonderful as one of Garbo's communist pals in &quot;Ninotchka&quot; is a joy in the role of Max , the doctor who spends a lifetime helping Edna with the children and in the process becomes her closest friend and confidant.The film marked another directing triumph for Mervyn LeRoy responsible for some stunning work at MGM including one of my favourites &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; with Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh. His sure hand is all over this production and he had a great way about him in guiding very emotional and sentimental dramas such as this.&quot;Blossoms&quot; was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, including Best Actress and quite rightly won for the stunning technicolour interior decoration. In that respect you would be hard pressed to see a  more sumptous production and the exquisite gowns done by Adrian in one of his last assignments at MGM are a sight to behold. It's also a joy to finally see Greer Garson's famous red hair in beautiful colour!!&quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot; is a wonderful tear jerking experience and I never fail to be moved by the conclusion of the film when little Tony (Pat Barker, in a beautiful performance) is found a home on Christmas Eve and despite the tearful seperation Edna finds herself suddenly with a new little charge who in the last scene is seen holding her hand through the bars of his cot indicating that life will go on in the infant home. Beautiful stuff and guaranteed to not leave a dry eye in the placeIf you enjoy emotional and moving dramas with first class performers and production values you cannot go past &quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot;.
