1532583,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007K7IAVC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","""Reel Love"" is a slight, but not unappealing, flight of fancy that made its TV debut on the CMT (Country Music Television) network.  CMT isn't particularly well known for its dramatic lineup of original programming, so my expectations of the Leann Rimes headlined movie were fairly minimal.  That said, the movie has a pleasing tartness that made it far more enjoyable than I had imagined it would be.  While the plot lacks any originality or surprise, the actors are appealing and the screenplay has more wit than comparable TV productions.  So if you like these types of movies (and you know who you are), I'd say that ""Reel Love"" is worth a look.  If, however, you don't appreciate the schmaltz, sentimentality and predictability inherent in the genre--nothing in this film will alter your opinion.  While I was entertained throughout, though, I don't imagine that I'll be replaying this anytime soon for a second viewing.Rimes plays a successful big city attorney whose life is upended when news of her father's heart attack draws her home.  Home is a beautiful fishing village and father is a cantankerous Burt Reynolds, so you know you're in store for lessons about simple living and familial commitment.  Of course, the movie plays out as a comedy as Rimes readjusts to her more humble beginnings, but she has a surprisingly appealing comic touch.  As she banters with old friends and a potential love interest (Shawn Roberts), the dialogue is playful and fun.  Of course, the fact that Rimes already has a boyfriend poses an obstacle--but don't worry, he's portrayed as such a buffoon, we can't take anything very seriously.  He is more of a joke to be ridiculed than a real character.  Tensions run high, though, in a fishing subplot near the end of the movie that unites the town and makes our hometown girl a hero.  Can Rimes find true love?  Can she mend fences with a distant father?  Will she see the advantages of small town living?  If I have to answer any of those questions for you, you've obviously never seen a TV movie!Rimes, though, is very likable.  Although not given a lot to do, Roberts is equally appealing (even if he stands around with a self-satisfied grin most of the time).  And Reynolds does the most he can with a rather stock character.  Some might have a soft spot for ""Reel Love.""  If this review was for watching the movie for free on CMT, I'd say go ahead and give it a try.  You just might like it.  But as a DVD purchase, it plays to a particular audience.  If you fall within that audience, this is a recommendation.  If not, it doesn't push out of the expected format to make it particularly noteworthy or unique.  Pleasant for those that like TV movie romance.

She, also, wears the same outfit for most of the movie.  In the short extras, she states she was ready to burn it by the end of the shoot.It's a PG kind of movie by CMT, but the kids will be totally bored.
