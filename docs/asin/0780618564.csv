Goldberg couldn't resist making a predictable jab about the Rodney King riot, the only instance in which I felt the film unsuccessfully attempted to mix real life politics and entertainment.  Aside from this, the film delivers on all counts, taking us through the forbidden, seldom seen world of film making, in which everyone seems to be expendable and no one seems to maintain control.

28865,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,0780618564,A Customer,"[4, 5]","Summary:Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is a high-powered Hollywood studio executive that has the power to make or break people's careers.  When he starts receiving postcards threatening his life he finally gets fed up with it and tries to figure out who it is.  He comes up with the name of David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio) and when he confronts him, they eventually end up struggling and Griffin ends up killing David.As it turns out, David isn't the person that was sending the death threats.  However, Griffin ends up hooking up with David's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi).  While the murder is working itself out, Griffin is also struggling to maintain his position in the studio from the threat of a new executive, Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher).  In the end, Griffin gets away with the murder, maintains his position in the studio, and marries June.Comments:I get the impression this is a movie by Hollywood for Hollywood, kind of like Mulholland Drive.  Except, unlike Mulholland Drive, this one does become somewhat interesting once the murder takes place.  The movie started out really slow and was completely uninteresting for about 20 to 30 minutes until the murder takes place.  After that, there is not a whole lot of tension until Griffin is taken in for the lineup where the police's eye witness misidentifies him and he gets off.There are a bunch of cameos, some which are kind of fun (Bruce Willis and Burt Reynolds specifically), but other than that and the intrigue that develops from the murder mystery, this movie is kind of boring and struggles to hold one's attention.Like I said, perhaps it is fun for people in Hollywood, but I was not really impressed.",2,Started slow but got kind of interesting.,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,1689,"['Summary', 'Griffin', 'Mill', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'high-powered', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'executive', 'power', 'make', 'break', 'people', 'careers', 'When', 'receiving', 'postcards', 'threatening', 'life', 'finally', 'fed', 'up', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'up', 'name', 'David', 'Kahane', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'when', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'struggling', 'Griffin', 'up', 'killing', 'David.As', 'out', 'David', ""n't"", 'person', 'was', 'sending', 'death', 'threats', 'However', 'Griffin', 'up', 'hooking', 'up', 'David', 'girlfriend', 'June', 'Gudmundsdottir', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'murder', 'working', 'out', 'Griffin', 'also', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'position', 'studio', 'threat', 'new', 'executive', 'Larry', 'Levy', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'end', 'Griffin', 'away', 'murder', 'position', 'studio', 'marries', 'June.Comments', 'get', 'impression', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'Hollywood', 'kind', 'like', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'Except', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'one', 'become', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'once', 'murder', 'place', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'really', 'slow', 'was', 'completely', 'uninteresting', 'about', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'murder', 'place', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'tension', 'Griffin', 'taken', 'lineup', 'where', 'police', 'eye', 'witness', 'misidentifies', 'off.There', 'are', 'bunch', 'cameos', 'are', 'kind', 'fun', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'specifically', 'other', 'intrigue', 'murder', 'mystery', 'movie', 'kind', 'boring', 'struggles', 'hold', 'one', 'attention.Like', 'said', 'perhaps', 'fun', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'impressed']",N/A
28866,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780618564,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I know that I really need to see more Altman.  I had only seen (up until this weekend) `Gosford Park' and `A Prairie Home Companion', neither of which really impressed me (I liked `Gosford Park'; didn't love it, and `A Prairie Home Companion' was just a mess) but I hear all these great things about him and so I keep telling myself that I need to just load up my Netflix queue with his work and have at it.  Anyways, Saturday night I happened to catch `The Player' on IFC while I was up walking my daughter to sleep and since I do happen to enjoy Tim Robbins (magnificent actor) I decided to give it a try.  I was immediately drawn in by the opening tracking scene consisting of interloping conversations (all of which were adlibbed) and from then on I was sold.`The Player' is a satire, so keep that in mind when watching this movie.  Satires have a tendency to do one of two extremes for me; they either really nail it or they really blow it.  I have yet to find a happy medium.  Thankfully `The Player' really nails it, especially as its second half gets underway.  The film tells the story of Griffin Mill, a studio executive who doesn't have the greatest of reputations; that is to say that his personality tends to rub some people the wrong way.  Proof of this very fact are the many death threats Griffin keeps receiving, threats that start to ware on his sanity.  When Griffin thinks he's found the source of these threats he takes impulsive action, action that results in murder, a murder he must then cover up.After the murder, Griffin's life starts to unravel as he struggles to keep his position at work as well as keep his relationship with girlfriend Bonnie all the while falling for June Gudmundsdottir, the beautiful girlfriend of Griffin's victim.  Things become even more complicated when the police begin investigating the murder and it becomes apparent that Griffin killed the wrong man.`The Player' though is really a movie within a movie, or a plot within a plot.  Sure, the dominant plot here revolves around Griffin committing murder and `getting away with it' but the real plot, the real point, is the exposure of the dark side of Hollywood, the backstabbing that takes place within the dog-eat-dog world of corporate politics and business practice; where one day your hot, the next your not and you can't do a thing about it.The movie, honestly, lives and dies with Tim Robbins, in that without his stellar performance the film would have failed.  Robbins is brilliant as Griffin Mill, perfectly grasping his deadpan detachment from his surroundings and then slowly slipping into his selfish and mechanical desperation.  I just found so many layers within his seemingly one-note performance.  Greta Scacchi is stunning as June.  She has an air of mystery that makes it easy to see why Griffin becomes so infatuated with her in the first place.  Cynthia Stevenson is also great as Bonnie, witty and funny and charming.  Whoopi Goldberg is hilarious (when is she not?) as Detective Susan Avery (I just love that `Oscar' scene; priceless) and Peter Gallagher is effective as Larry Levy, Griffin's office threat.  Fred Ward rubbed me wrong here; I just didn't like his humor, and Vincent D'Onofrio's natural nervous demeanor played against him here.  I normally love him but I found him a bit too annoying here (but his character is short lived...).Altman, it must be said, has a wonderful way of placing the pieces of his film together here.  I saw it in `Gosford Park' as well, but here to an even greater degree.  The film just flows beautifully, from one scene to the next, and he has a way of extracting the right emotions from his scenes.  Sometimes those emotions are unexpected, but they are always genuine.  Each scene is beautifully crafted, never feeling out of place or pointless.As a side point of interest, `The Player' has one of the most articulately constructed love scenes I've ever seen in a film.  There is nothing truly explicit; in fact the entire scene is one long close up of Tim Robbins' sweaty face, but it is completely titillating.  I never thought I'd find Tim Robbins attractive, but that scene is flawlessly exciting.  The scene is memorable and truly anticipated and one that adds layers to the relationship budding between the characters.The script is witty and tightly woven, interesting and engrossing and complimented beautifully by the well rounded performances of the cast.  Unlike `Gosford Park' or `A Prairie Home Companion', this is Robbins' movie as apposed to being a true ensemble piece.  Yes, there are lots of actors here but none have the weight of Robbins' character thus none deserve the amount of attention he deserves.  Robbins' is marvelous here, yet another brilliant performance in his already extensively phenomenal resume.  I highly recommend this film for it is fresh and fun and extremely smart.",5,A smart satire that hits its mark and wins my respect...,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,4876,"['know', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'Altman', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'up', 'weekend', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Prairie', 'Home', 'Companion', 'really', 'impressed', 'liked', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Prairie', 'Home', 'Companion', 'was', 'just', 'mess', 'hear', 'great', 'things', 'so', 'keep', 'telling', 'need', 'just', 'load', 'up', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'work', 'have', 'Anyways', 'Saturday', 'night', 'happened', 'catch', 'Player', 'IFC', 'was', 'up', 'walking', 'daughter', 'sleep', 'do', 'happen', 'enjoy', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'magnificent', 'actor', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'was', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'opening', 'tracking', 'scene', 'consisting', 'interloping', 'conversations', 'were', 'adlibbed', 'then', 'was', 'sold.', 'Player', 'satire', 'so', 'keep', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'Satires', 'have', 'tendency', 'do', 'one', 'two', 'extremes', 'either', 'really', 'nail', 'really', 'blow', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'happy', 'medium', 'Thankfully', 'Player', 'really', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'underway', 'film', 'story', 'Griffin', 'Mill', 'studio', 'executive', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'greatest', 'reputations', 'say', 'personality', 'rub', 'people', 'wrong', 'way', 'Proof', 'very', 'fact', 'are', 'many', 'death', 'threats', 'Griffin', 'receiving', 'threats', 'start', 'ware', 'sanity', 'When', 'Griffin', 'found', 'source', 'threats', 'impulsive', 'action', 'action', 'results', 'murder', 'murder', 'must', 'then', 'cover', 'up.After', 'murder', 'Griffin', 'life', 'unravel', 'keep', 'position', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'keep', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Bonnie', 'while', 'falling', 'June', 'Gudmundsdottir', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'Griffin', 'victim', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'police', 'begin', 'investigating', 'murder', 'apparent', 'Griffin', 'killed', 'wrong', 'man.', 'Player', 'though', 'really', 'movie', 'movie', 'plot', 'plot', 'Sure', 'dominant', 'plot', 'here', 'around', 'Griffin', 'committing', 'murder', 'getting', 'away', 'real', 'plot', 'real', 'point', 'exposure', 'dark', 'side', 'Hollywood', 'backstabbing', 'place', 'dog-eat-dog', 'world', 'corporate', 'politics', 'business', 'practice', 'where', 'one', 'day', 'hot', 'next', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'thing', 'it.The', 'movie', 'honestly', 'lives', 'dies', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'stellar', 'performance', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'failed', 'Robbins', 'brilliant', 'Griffin', 'Mill', 'perfectly', 'grasping', 'deadpan', 'detachment', 'surroundings', 'then', 'slowly', 'slipping', 'selfish', 'mechanical', 'desperation', 'just', 'found', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'seemingly', 'one-note', 'performance', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'stunning', 'June', 'air', 'mystery', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Griffin', 'so', 'infatuated', 'first', 'place', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'also', 'great', 'Bonnie', 'witty', 'funny', 'charming', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'hilarious', 'when', 'not', 'Detective', 'Susan', 'Avery', 'just', 'love', 'Oscar', 'scene', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'effective', 'Larry', 'Levy', 'Griffin', 'office', 'threat', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'here', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'humor', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'natural', 'nervous', 'demeanor', 'played', 'here', 'normally', 'love', 'found', 'bit', 'too', 'annoying', 'here', 'character', 'short', 'lived', '.Altman', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'wonderful', 'way', 'placing', 'pieces', 'film', 'together', 'here', 'saw', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'even', 'greater', 'degree', 'film', 'just', 'beautifully', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'way', 'extracting', 'right', 'emotions', 'scenes', 'Sometimes', 'emotions', 'are', 'unexpected', 'are', 'always', 'genuine', 'scene', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'never', 'feeling', 'place', 'pointless.As', 'side', 'point', 'interest', 'Player', 'one', 'most', 'articulately', 'constructed', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'nothing', 'truly', 'explicit', 'fact', 'entire', 'scene', 'one', 'long', 'close', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'sweaty', 'face', 'completely', 'titillating', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'find', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'attractive', 'scene', 'flawlessly', 'exciting', 'scene', 'memorable', 'truly', 'anticipated', 'one', 'layers', 'relationship', 'budding', 'characters.The', 'script', 'witty', 'tightly', 'woven', 'interesting', 'engrossing', 'complimented', 'beautifully', 'well', 'rounded', 'performances', 'cast', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Prairie', 'Home', 'Companion', 'Robbins', 'movie', 'apposed', 'being', 'true', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'Yes', 'are', 'lots', 'actors', 'here', 'none', 'have', 'weight', 'Robbins', 'character', 'thus', 'none', 'amount', 'attention', 'Robbins', 'marvelous', 'here', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'already', 'extensively', 'phenomenal', 'resume', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fresh', 'fun', 'extremely', 'smart']",N/A

28872,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,0780618564,Brian,"[1, 1]","Full disclosure: I'm not a big Altman fan (my favorite work of his by far is 1973's 'The Long Goodbye'), as I feel his best attributes were borrowed from superior directors-- a high-brow DePalma, if you will-- and his sense of cinematic coherency consistently suffered for his ponderous obsession with subversive subtexts (in fact, he boasts on the audio commentary for 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller' that he never cared much about story or script, which probably is so much iconoclastic bluster but, if even partially true, certainly shows).  I have heard from many, many people, however, that 'The Player' is a must-see for any movie buff, especially for those who, like me, lament the steady decline of the Hollywood product since its golden era. So my feelings about Altman notwithstanding, I viewed TP as objectively as I could, based on its own merits, and wasn't too impressed.The story is fairly boilerplate: a whiz-kid studio exec, overvalued and pushed to the brink of paranoia, accidentally kills a screenwriter whom he mistakenly thinks has been sending him threatening postcards. Deception and mayhem ensue. I suppose it plays the dime-novel plotline for ironic laughs, but it's not very conducive to suspense (even fake suspense), and there isn't much real humor involved either, unless you find relentless 'inside' references to classic flicks, celebrities, hackneyed treatments and industry power brokers funny (although I'll admit I had fun catching as many of those nods as I could). The script is adequate, but not bitingly clever; the direction capable, but certainly not exceptional, particularly taken as homage. The worst aspect by far, though, are the performances, which range from mediocre to awful. Now, to be fair, when you cast scads of entertainers whose skill sets vary drastically (try Lyle Lovett's dramatic chops vs. Richard E. Grant's), you can't expect miracles-- but a filmmaker ought to be prepared to deal with that problem when his subject matter revolves around the sad state of modern filmmaking, no? And some of the worst acting comes from Tim Robbins as the lead character, Griffin Mills. I'll concede he was young and relatively inexperienced at the time, but he is too much the lightweight (literally) to fill the $2000 suits he wears.Others may argue that hit-and-miss production quality in a movie parodying the picture biz is appropriate, but by those standards 'Burn, Hollywood, Burn' and 'The Pickle' must be masterpieces. Effective satire and black comedy make up a rare and precious genre that relies on precise execution to work, and I find there are just too many flaws here.

The audience, which no doubt contained many people from the entertainment community, laughed knowingly throughout. I couldn't help thinking, though, that the biggest joke was on them. For if THE PLAYER depicts a corrupt environment, it's the people in that world that make it that way.As usual, Altman gets all the details right: the receptionist being coached in the proper way to answer the phone; the asinine rationalizations of non-talents hawking fifth-rate ideas; or the constant shifts in fashion represented by my favorite joke, the running gag about the bottled waters. Also as usual, any deeper insight is lacking. Altman focuses on greed and power hunger, and daringly implies they may be the cause of Hollywood's problems. It's not much of a recommendation for a satire that it &quot;reveals&quot; something everyone knows going into the theater. (If the film showed the people around Robbins cognizant and accepting of his guilt, for example, or if it showed audiences reacting favorably to the mish-mash he ends up producing, it would have more punch.)It's been said that every film about Hollywood tells basically the same story, and there's a reason for it.  Stories, as works of art, have an inherent form. They are logical, and inevitably impose that logic on the events they recount. Hollywood is essentially illogical; it cannot be captured by story-telling, because no narrative can express its inherent flight from reason. Exaggerations like allowing an executive to get away with murder are momentarily diverting metaphors, funny twists which nonetheless pale before the daily insanity of a town running on bluff, incompetence, deceit and stupidity. Besides, if any Hollywood filmmaker came close to showing its real depravity, he'd never work again. Breaking Tinseltown's code of silence is its one unforgiveable sin.THE PLAYER is certainly a reasonable addition to the films-about-Hollywood genre, and fits well on Altman's resume. It's moderately entertaining, and harmless enough as long as you recognize that its depiction of Hollywood is about as accurate as GONE WITH THE WIND's depiction of the Civil War. It flatters audiences into thinking that they're thinking, when in fact they are reacting precisely as planned.

He was under extreme pressure personally (he was receiving hate mail sent by a  mysterious writer he brushed off) and at work (his job was threatened by the incoming and rising Levy (Peter Gallagher)). Griffin was soon involved in a murder which he desperately tried to shake off and kept hanging on to his studio job. Not to mention he found his new love (Greta Scacchi) - the girl of the murder victim. Entered Whoopi Goldberg who played the relaxed but shrewd detective who seemed to know the truth. She lighted up the screen.Could Griffin Mel succeed both personally and professionally?The best scene was when Griffin Mel was invited to the mug shots. Could he get away with it? That was interesting. And how would the existing studio head, the second-in-command (Tim Robbins), the new comer (Peter Gallagher)shuffle the jobs?Near the end was the screening of a movie in a movie whose ending, under the instruction of Mel Griffin, changed from a ""non-Hollywood and no big star"" one to a ""happy ending with Bruce Willis"". That would guarantee big box office and audience' satisfaction. So I kept wondering about the ending of The Player. Is this the ending the audience like or what the studio think we like? For me, I might have chosen a different ending.Albeit a bit slow in pace, the movie was fun to watch and packed with cameo appearances of big stars - Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, Andy McDowell, John Cusack, Anjelica Huston, Burt Reynolds, Mimi Rogers, to name a few.

W. Griffith/Cecil B. De Mille), is not a player with hearts so much as a player with dreams.  He is a young and powerful film exec who hears thousands of movie pitches a year, but can only buy twelve.  So he must do a lot of dissembling, not to mention outright lying, along with saying ""We'll get back to you,"" etc.  This is what he especially must say to writers.  And sometimes they hold a grudge.  In this case one of the rejected writers begins to stalk Griffin Mill and send him threatening postcards.  And so the plot begins.Tim Robbins, in a creative tour de force, plays Griffin Mill with such a delightful, ironic charm  that we cannot help but identify with him even as he violates several layers of human trust.  The script by Michael Tolkin smoothly combines the best elements of a thriller with a kind of Terry Southern satirical intent that keeps us totally engrossed throughout.  The direction by Robert Altman is full of inside Hollywood jokes and remembrances, including cameos by dozens of Hollywood stars, some of whom get to say nasty things about producers.  The scenes are well-planned and then infused with witty asides.  The tampon scene at police headquarters with Whoopi Goldberg is an hilarious case in point, while the sequence of scenes from Greta Scacchi's character's house to the manslaughter scene outside the Pasadena Rialto, is wonderfully conceived and nicely cut.  Also memorable is the all black and white dress dinner scene in which Cher is the only person in red, a kind of mean or silly joke, depending on your perspective.  During the same scene Mill gives a little speech in which he avers that ""movies are art,"" a statement that amounts to sardonic irony since, as a greedy producer, he cares nothing at all about art, but only about box office success.  His words also form a kind of dramatic irony when one realizes that this movie itself really is a work of art.  As Altman observes in a trailing clip, the movie ""becomes itself.""  The Machiavellian ending illustrates this with an almost miraculous dovetailing.  This is the kind of script that turns most screen writers Kermit-green with envy.Incidentally, Joe Gillis, the Hollywood writer played by William Holden in Sunset Boulevard--personifying all unsuccessful screen writers--actually does call during the movie, but Mill doesn't recognize the name and has to be told he is being put on, further revealing the narrow confines of his character.In short, this is a wonderfully clever, diabolically cynical satire of Hollywood and the movie industry.  This is one of those movies that, if you care anything at all about film, you must see.  Period.  It is especially delicious if you hate Hollywood.  It is also one of the best movies ever made about Hollywood, to be ranked up there with A Star is Born (1937) (Janet Gaynor, Fredric March); Sunset Boulevard (1950); A Star is Born (1954) (Judy Garland, James Mason); and Postcards from the Edge (1990).I must add that in the annals of film, this has to go down as one of the best Hollywood movies not to win a single Academy Award, although it was nominated for three: Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing.  I suspect the Academy felt that the satire hit a little too close to home for comfort.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",5,Joe Gillis calling...,998352000,"08 21, 2001",2001,3502,"['Players', 'only', 'love', 'when', ""'re"", 'playing', 'Stevie', 'NicksGriffin', 'Mill', 'name', 'kind', 'ersatz', 'Hollywood', 'feel', 'cf.', 'D.', 'W.', 'Griffith/Cecil', 'B', 'De', 'Mille', 'not', 'player', 'hearts', 'so', 'much', 'player', 'dreams', 'young', 'powerful', 'film', 'exec', 'who', 'thousands', 'movie', 'pitches', 'year', 'can', 'only', 'buy', 'twelve', 'must', 'do', 'lot', 'dissembling', 'not', 'mention', 'outright', 'lying', 'saying', ""'ll"", 'get', 'back', 'etc', 'what', 'especially', 'must', 'say', 'writers', 'sometimes', 'hold', 'grudge', 'case', 'one', 'rejected', 'writers', 'stalk', 'Griffin', 'Mill', 'send', 'threatening', 'postcards', 'so', 'plot', 'begins.Tim', 'Robbins', 'creative', 'tour', 'force', 'Griffin', 'Mill', 'delightful', 'ironic', 'charm', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'identify', 'even', 'several', 'layers', 'human', 'trust', 'script', 'Michael', 'Tolkin', 'smoothly', 'best', 'elements', 'thriller', 'kind', 'Terry', 'Southern', 'satirical', 'intent', 'totally', 'engrossed', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'full', 'inside', 'Hollywood', 'jokes', 'remembrances', 'including', 'cameos', 'dozens', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'whom', 'get', 'say', 'nasty', 'things', 'producers', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-planned', 'then', 'infused', 'witty', 'asides', 'tampon', 'scene', 'police', 'headquarters', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'hilarious', 'case', 'point', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'character', 'house', 'manslaughter', 'scene', 'Pasadena', 'Rialto', 'wonderfully', 'conceived', 'nicely', 'cut', 'Also', 'memorable', 'black', 'white', 'dress', 'dinner', 'scene', 'Cher', 'only', 'person', 'red', 'kind', 'mean', 'silly', 'joke', 'depending', 'perspective', 'same', 'scene', 'Mill', 'little', 'speech', 'movies', 'are', 'art', 'statement', 'sardonic', 'irony', 'greedy', 'producer', 'nothing', 'art', 'only', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'words', 'also', 'form', 'kind', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'when', 'one', 'movie', 'really', 'work', 'art', 'Altman', 'trailing', 'clip', 'movie', 'Machiavellian', 'ending', 'almost', 'miraculous', 'dovetailing', 'kind', 'script', 'most', 'screen', 'writers', 'Kermit-green', 'envy.Incidentally', 'Joe', 'Gillis', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'played', 'William', 'Holden', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'personifying', 'unsuccessful', 'screen', 'writers', 'actually', 'call', 'movie', 'Mill', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'name', 'be', 'told', 'being', 'put', 'further', 'revealing', 'narrow', 'confines', 'character.In', 'short', 'wonderfully', 'clever', 'diabolically', 'cynical', 'satire', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'industry', 'one', 'movies', 'care', 'anything', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'Period', 'especially', 'delicious', 'hate', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'ranked', 'up', 'there', 'A', 'Star', 'Born', '1937', 'Janet', 'Gaynor', 'Fredric', 'March', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', '1950', 'Star', 'Born', '1954', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'James', 'Mason', 'Postcards', 'Edge', '1990', '.I', 'must', 'add', 'annals', 'film', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'not', 'win', 'single', 'Academy', 'Award', 'was', 'nominated', 'three', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Editing', 'suspect', 'Academy', 'felt', 'satire', 'hit', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'comfort.', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","Everybody in Hollywood takes the cheap-and-dirty approach to success -- even to successful murder.That's the theme to Robert Altman's bitter, tart, and hilarious black comedy ""The Player,"" based on Michael Tolkin's novel. The caustic observations and barbed wit bring Hollywood's nastiness to light, and Altman's minimalist direction only underscores the brilliant script and acting.Exec Griffin (Tim Robbins) is nervous enough about his increasingly imperilled job. But then postcards with death threats start arriving -- apparently from a writer he lied to months ago. After some research, he thinks he's found the guy -- David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio), a POed writer whose script he mercilessly rejected. After a disastrous meeting with David, Griffin kills him in an alley.But that's not the end -- the threatening messages keep coming, and Griffin becomes more desperate as he becomes a suspect in Kahane's murder. He also becomes fascinated by David's chilly artist girlfriend (Greta Scacchi), and tries to bury his fear in an awkward love affair. But as the investigation heats up, Griffin is threatened with the ultimate cancellation.If ""The Player"" has a meaning, it's that everyone who wants power in Hollywood has to sell their souls -- legally, personally, or just by selling out so your movie has a pat happy ending. Like planets being sucked into a black hole, they all get pulled in by the lure of affluence -- they don't even notice their souls vanishing!It's also wickedly funny to watch. Altman peppers the movie with celebrity cameos (John Cusack, Anjelica Huston, Bruce Willis, to name a few). The dialogue is simply brilliant -- at one point, Robbins muses, ""I was just thinking what an interesting concept it is to eliminate the writer from the artistic process. If we could just get rid of these actors and directors, maybe we've got something here."" Talk about a reality TV prediction.Altman's style is minimalist here, with lots of tense moments, sexy interludes -- right up to the ironic twist finale, which makes you wonder for a moment just how much of ""The Player"" is really fiction. And during dramatic scenes (the murder, the cobra, the phone calls), Altman stretches the tension as taut as a wire, and leaves it to slowly slacken over the scenes that follow. The only scene that doesn't work is the police interrogation with Whoopi Goldberg.

I saw ""Short Cuts"" first, and now consider that Altman's best picture.

As such it is part of a long lineage that includes ""Sunset Boulevard.""  Compared with the utterly brilliant ""Short Cuts"" I found ""The Player"" to be somewhat contrived, and not always credible.  In the light of Hitchcock's technique, the explicit crime shown in ""The Player"" makes its political message sharper, but seems to work less well than the trivial ""MacGuffins"" that served as pivots for the emotionally exiting plots and images in Hitchcock's films.  I'll admit that I showed less humility some years ago when Altman presented ""Health,"" - an excellent film in the ""Nashville"" format, which hadn't been released commercially. From the audience, I said I was fascinated by ""Three Women"" - and got a laugh that surprised me. Then I asked him naively what he would do differently if he were to re-make ""Three Women.""

28893,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0780618564,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","In the realm of satire, ""The Player"" is one of the best. A viscous, funny satire about Hollywood that can easily be called one of Robert Altman's best films. This is a movie buff movie, in the sense that it is jam-packed with film references and celebrity cameos. Not only is it entertaining, well made, well written, and well acted. It's fun to watch. Tim Robbins plays Griffin Mill, a Hollywood hotshot studio executive who is in danger of losing his job. Around the same time, he begins receiving anonymous death threats from a rejected screenwriter (Vincent D'Onofrio). Upon learning who the screenwriter is, he meets him at a movie theatre.  Their meeting ends with Griffin killing the man. Making the death look like a botched robbery, Griffin tries to return to normal but finds that he's being followed by a mysterious man (Lyle Lovett) and is questioned frequently by a pair of cops (one of who is Whoopi Goldberg). To top it off, Griffin finds himself falling for the screenwriter's girlfriend. The movie's huge cast includes Fred Ward, Malcolm McDowell, Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte, Kim Basinger, Alec Baldwin, Lily Tomlin, Susan Sarandon, Scott Glenn, and many others...Many appearing only in mere cameos. Not a lot of director's could handle this sort of material. Only Robert Altman could have gathered as many actors for one film and not turned into a forced, convoluted film. Altman was a fantastic director who made many great films over the course of his long career ('McCabe & Mrs. Miller' & 'Short Cuts' & 'M*A*S*H' to name a few) and ""The Player"" ranks right up there with the best. It cuts down deep to the center of Hollywood, exposing the darkside of it and doesn't candy coat anything. The movie accomplishes what Billy Wilder did with 'Sunset Boulevard.' He tells it exactly how it is. Some people won't like the film...As I said it has a lot of movie references. Many of which most people won't understand. This isn't a movie for the casual film viewer. But it is one of the best satires around and certainly one of the best HOLLYWOOD satires around.

The actors made up all their lines. Etc. But by the end of the commentary you sense that, behind it all, he reallly is quite proud. He should be. It may not be as biting a satire as Network, but it lands more than just a few shots at Hollywood's corporate culture. And surprisingly big stars (Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, John Cusack) show up at every corner in cameos supporting the film's thesis: that studio executives have no soul and consequently make movies that have no soul. Or at least that's my take. Anyway, regardless of who is responsible for ultimate credit, this is a great film. It opens with a legendary nine-minute single take on a swooping crane (reminiscent of Touch of Evil) and accumulates suspense as a series of threatening postcards are delivered to Tim Robbins' character from an angry screenwriter.This is a flipper disc, which means that it contains information on both sides. On one is the film in widescreen; the other, special features. The picture-quality could be better (probably because the movie is long and they fit it all on one side) but is of course a thousand times superior to VHS. The sound mix, with Altman's tradmark overlapping dialogue, is good. The extras include the theatrical trailer, cast bios, cameo player bios, a making-of featurette, deleted scenes and commentary by Altman and the writer, Michael Tolkin. As usual, the deleted scenes and the featurette are nothing to write home about, but the commentary is sporadically interesting.

The Player, however, I think would appeal to almost anyone.  There's great stuff for film buffs and literary critics  (having lots of puns and references to classic films - both subtle and  obvious), for people interested in Hollywood (this is primarily, a story  about this town and the industry that drives it), but there's also some  good genuine suspense.  The Player is a kind of &quot;Snake Eats its  Tail&quot; story of Hollywood and in particular one studio executive who  gets embroiled in a murder of a writer.  Expertly played by Tim Robins, the  exec also is being sent anonymous hate mail and being threatened by a new  star player exec just brought in by the boss.  With all these stresses, he  manages to get involved with a somewhat mysterious woman who is almost  a  reflection of himself. In DVD form, it's great, with a crystal clear Dolby  Digital 5.1 Soundtrack that pounds the bass for added suspense.  It comes  in both Widescreen and Full Screen formats.  Lots of Special Feautures make  it even better - deleted scenes, a featurette with Altman himself, a  Commentary Track with Altman, and of course Bios.  But what bios!  Not only  are the main characters in the film bio'ed, but all the star cameos are  bio'ed.  Altman is famous for having tons of celebrity cameos at least in  his more recent films and this one is no exception.  There have got to be  at least 40, maybe as much as 80 different cameos.  It is after all, a  movie about Hollywood, and you tend to run into stars a lot if you're a  studio exec.  So for each of these cameos, the DVD has a bio, plus a link  to jumpt to the scene that the cameo was in.  A lot of these cameos you  would never even have known about without this helpful feature because,  though some are obvious and have dialogue and are reference by name, many  are not and last for a split second.

However, I don't feel it deserves the classic status it has achieved.The script starts out quite well.  Griffin, a Hollywood executive is recieving threats from an angry writer.  He ends up killing who he thinks is sending the threats but it turns out to be the wrong guy.  Griffin is also fighting to save his job and is working on making a movie from a writer that insists it has no stars and a sad ending.  This is where the film's problem is.  There are numerous subplots but none are developed enough.  The police investigation doesn't go anywhere.  We don't learn much of anything about this writer who is threatening Griffin.  We also see very little development in the upcoming script.  When the film ends, it simply feels incomplete.  On the up side, film buffs will appreciate alot of the in-jokes.The cast is relativly strong with a ton of celebrity cameos and some good chemistry.  Tim Robbins totally steals the show however.  It may be because he is just a very strong actor but it's also partly because his character is the only one which really feels developed.The Player would be a classic if it were an hour longer or focused more on one of the many plots.

28900,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0780618564,Michael Crane,"[30, 31]","Can movies about the movie business actually be exciting and worth watching?  &quot;The Player&quot; most certainly is an exciting and worth-while film that has many layers within it.  At first glance, this appears only as an odd thriller that's both bizarre and unbelievable--but upon further investigation, you'll find out that this is something that is so much more than your ordinary thriller.Griffin Mill is a studio executive that listens to movie pitches on a daily basis.  Some pitches are great while others aren't as fantastic.  One of the writers that Griffin never called back seems to have held a grudge against him, as he sends him threatening post-cards telling the exec that his days are numbered.  Not knowing what else to do, Griffin decides to confront the suspected writer only to end up being involved in a murder.  As he tries to cover his tracks and play it cool, it is clear that Griffin has been thrown into an uncontrollable scenario that could only be found in the movies.I admit that the first time I saw this film, I didn't really know how to react to it.  I didn't know if I liked it, but I knew that I didn't hate it.  And, I confess that by the end of the movie, I was scratching my head in confusion.  It was the second viewing where I really found out what the movie was all about and came to love it.  The movie is not your typical thriller.  It actually is more of a satire that targets the movie industry and movies in general.  And, it's done in such a way that you really don't catch onto that with the first viewing, as you're caught up in the story and are convinced that you're watching nothing more than a thriller.  This movie has a number of layers to it--even layers that I probably haven't caught onto yet.  You know a film has unquestionable power when you are tricked into believing that it is something else the first time and then come to realize that it is something completely different the next time around.The film is brilliantly directed by Robert Altman.  There's no way in heck that the movie would be the success it is had it been under a different director.  He knew exactly what he wanted and how to get it.  The acting from Tim Robbins and company is really a sight to see.  It's also a treat to see so many cameos by different famous actors that we all know and love.The DVD has a few goodies to offer for those who enjoy DVD extras.  The picture is decent looking--nothing extraordinary, but decent.  It says on the back cover that it was remastered in &quot;High Definition,&quot; but I think improvements could've been made in certain areas.  Extras on the DVD include commentary from the director and writer, a Robert Altman featurette, deleted scenes, the original trailer and more.  A pretty nice package that doesn't disappoint with exception towards picture quality in some areas.&quot;The Player&quot; is a superbly executed film that doesn't jump out right away to let you know what it is really all about.

The rudeness and egotism, the closed society that only leads to success, not if your talented but if you know the right people. This is material Altman knows from the inside and the outside. He owned Hollywood in the 1970s, when his films like M*A*S*H,"" ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" and ""Nashville"" were the most audacious work in town. Hollywood cast Altman into the outer darkness in the 1980s, when his eclectic vision didn't fit with movies made by marketing studies. He came back with ""The Player"" that is not simply about Hollywood, but about the way we live now, in which the top executives of many industries are cut off from the real work of their employees, and exist in a rarefied atmosphere of greedy competition with one another.""The Player"" opens with a very long continuous shot that is quite a technical achievement, yes, but also works in another way, to summarize Hollywood's state of mind in the early 1990s.

At least the performances are first rate without all the overlapping dialog that one had to endure in GOSFORD PARK, but the satire is laid on pretty thick even after the brutal accidental murder scene.TIM ROBBINS plays a Hollywood producer who is unable to shake off the persistence of an aspiring writer without resorting to killing him in a moment of desperation and anger. He gets control of himself thereafter and is able to play innocent, especially after a line-up of suspects including him fails to produce a witness who could identify him as being near the scene of the crime.The biggest in-joke of all is Altman's decision to have a marathon lineup of stars on the sidelines, popping up at every other moment when least suspected, and often with no more than a few seconds of screen time. The film within a film (a sub-plot bearing resemblance to the real film plot) is cleverly used to provide a neat finish to the tale. And in doing so, it utilizes (very briefly) the services of stars like SUSAN SARANDON, PETER FALK, JULIA ROBERTS and BRUCE WILLIS.GRETA SCACCHI, PETER GALLAGHER and DEAN STOCKWELL do well in the most prominent supporting roles but it's TIM ROBBINS who owns the spotlight throughout and he's excellent as the conflicted man who commits a crime and gets away with it in a Hollywood film colony that has no conscience.WHOOPI GOLDBERG's role as Detective Susan Avery is unforgivably coarse and totally unbelievable as a woman whose professional conduct borders on burlesque. Equally ineffective is LYLE LOVETT as a fellow detective amused by her shenanigans.There are plenty of faults, but the film manages to hold the interest with its unique blend of suspense, humor, satire and tragedy.

This is because it is basically a huge inside joke on mainstream Hollywood film-making, with too many obscure references for a Hollywood outsider to effectively process the first time around.Also like ""The Big Lebowski,  the satire and sardonic wit is packaged around what appears to be a crime drama, with the straight drama itself engaging enough to entertain most viewers the first time around.Tim Robbins plays Griffin Mill, a high level studio executive whose job is listening to the countless pitches that come his way from aspiring writers wanting to get their screen play into production. The studio only produces a dozen features a year so Griffin mostly hands out rejections. He has made at least one major enemy during the process, an unknown writer who begins sending him threatening postcards.Griffin thinks he has a line on the identity of his enemy, an unpublished writer named David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio-Private Pyle in ""Full Metal Jacket) who lives in the valley with his artist girlfriend (Greta Scacchi). But their confrontation goes bad and Griffin accidentally kills him. Things get worse for Griffin; he becomes the main suspect for the murder, he gets a post-murder postcard revealing that he murdered the wrong guy, and he is in danger of being replaced by a newly hired hotshot Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher).""The Player"" is most famous for an eight-minute tracking shot at the very beginning of the film, self-reflexively compared to Hitchcock's ""Rope"" and to Welles' ""Touch of Evil""; and full of Altman's trademark overlapping dialogue. Also notable are the 50 or so actors who make cameo appearances throughout the feature; most just play themselves (it is after all set in Hollywood) and it is entertaining just trying to identify everyone.The DVD has a commentary by Altman and writer Michael Tolkin. Unfortunately Altman's film-making style does not lend itself to organized reflection so he mostly just rambles on about everything but the film; and Tolkin has major issues with the whole Hollywood scene so his commentary is just a continuous rant and whine about the system.It is important to remember that Altman is essentially a Hollywood black sheep who has been at war with Hollywood his whole career. The Hollywood establishment is uncomfortable with him because he won't make their standard pre-sold product and yet he manages to crank out enough commercial successes on his own terms to keep them off balance.""The Player"" is kind of his revenge picture, he knew that its production would cause a wave of paranoia to sweep the industry and he made paranoia the defining characteristic of the film. He views Hollywood as a marketing machine that both drives and is driven by the lowest common denominator of audience demographics.During the opening tracking shot look for Griffin's meeting with Buck Henry, who pitches a sequel to ""The Graduate"" (Elaine and Benjamin have a daughter and he suggests ""The Postgraduate"" for the sequel's title). Henry improvised this pitch which is funnier with each viewing, and appropriately also had a cameo in ""The Graduate"".These film allusions are everywhere as Hollywood's past seems to be passing judgment on its pathetic present. Watch for the bungled meeting at the hotel, the scene ends with the camera centered on a picture of Hitchcock on the hotel wall-a shot of about the same duration as a typical Hitchcock cameo (in his own films).For sheer comedy watch for Griffin's visit to police headquarters where the Pasadena detective (Whoopi Goldberg), interviews him in the busy squad room. Another detective (Lyle Lovett) is a movie buff who keeps chanting ""One of us! One of us!"" from ""Freaks"".Griffin plots to derail the threat inside the studio by setting up Levy with a script pitched by self-styled auteur Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant). It's a Susan Hayward vehicle with the heroine going to the gas chamber because ""it's reality, and that's what happens."" Oakley wants real which means no stars and a non-Hollywood ending. Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis are mentioned as exactly type of casting Oakley does not want; which foreshadows his pending commercial corruption and artistic compromise.This is a film that is meant to be watched closely (the beginning tracking shot is Altman's way of getting our attention and warning us that we will need to pay attention). Audience involvement is very important to him and he is counting on a motivated audience who brings considerable prior knowledge to the viewing.Then again, what do I know?

The Bicycle Thief.""""It's an art movie. It doesn't count. We're talking about movie movies.""Robert Altman is one of my favorite directors, mainly for the way he finds insight in the most inane actions or phrases. This short exchange has many layers when taken out of context and many more when taken in context. With this dialog, The Player reveals exactly why Hollywood movies don't make the money they should. Not because they don't make quality films, but because when a good movie does make money, it doesn't count because it's not a ""movie movie."" If he stopped to really listen to what was being said, he would've seen that art films have a great drawing power and actually don't cost much to make. But people still wonder why the modern film industry is suffering.Wait, there's more. The people in the room don't know it, but producer Griffin Mill, in a fit of paranoia, killed an unemployed screenwriter outside the theater that night. He was being stalked by a writer, but he blamed (and murdered) the wrong one. Now he's still being stalked, still in danger of losing his job, and the cops suspect him of murder. Not a good week for Mister Mill.As the conversation presses on, Mill's potential replacement passes around a newspaper, telling people to read random headlines to be made into scripts. Mill spots the story on his murder which we're already watching play out in a movie.Yes, it's that type of movie, the self-referential Hollywood movie about Hollywood movies that keeps teasing itself for the viewers' enjoyment.

The Player is a terrific movie that'll hold your attention until the end but still manage to turn itself into the Hollywood that it takes a sardonic potshot at.And sardonic jabs abound -- a roving eye is fixed at Hollywood's teeming writers with the Next Big Idea, at the eventual futility of compassion and morality (Bonnie, the only decent studio exec who stands for what she believes is right, loses everything in the end), even at the LA police (Whoopi Goldberg's notorious gag ""This is Pasadena. We don't catch wrong criminals here. That's LA"").The soundtrack is fitting, unsettlingly ""American Beauty""-like but super-bassy (P.S. remember to adjust your treble a little higher than usual). Watch for guest cameos from Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Bruce Willis, Any McDowell, John Cussack. The DVD also has a section of reels that didn't make the final cut of the movie, which is quite a treat in itself -- apparently Jeff Daniels, Patrick Schwaze etc had a small part too which the actual movie didn't include.Needless to say Hollywood is not your average straight-laced business, nor is this paradoxical sketch about it.

28915,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,0780618564,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[5, 7]","Robert Altman's ""The Player"" opens with a breathtaking crane shot across a film studio lot.  The film then goes into the story of Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), a shallow studio executive with little creative insight.  His story unfolds as the film itself flings one zinger after another at the creative void known as Hollywood.  ""The Player"" has gained the reputation of being a biting satire on the state of the film industry - a place where style matters over substance and where compromise triumphs over artistic vision.  The truth, however, is that the film is a mixed bag.  Full of wit at times but flat most of the time.Mill is troubled by a rumor that he is about to be replaced by a new hotshot rival executive named Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher).  To make matters worse, Mill is also receiving threatening postcards from an anonymous writer Griffin had previously rejected.  A series of circumstantial clues leads to Mill tagging David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio) as his tormentor and Mill does away with him.  Along come the police and lead investigator Susan Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) who slowly puts the pieces of the puzzle together but is eventually thwarted by a witness with poor eyesight.""The Player"" reveals itself to be many things upon close scrutiny.  The film is a loving tribute to cinema as the characters and settings are always referencing films of the past in various ways.  The film is also a sort of game as you try and catch as many real life Hollywood celebrities as you can as the film unfolds.  It is also effective as a satire of Hollywood thinking as we get to see how a combination of Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, and taking the easy way out utterly undermines a fictional film being produced.  Yet ""The Player"" is also disappointingly un-involving as a viewing experience.  Not much interest is generated by the murder, the murder investigation, and the subsequent cover-up.  The characters also are muted.  Robbins, Cynthia Stevenson, and Goldberg turn in acceptable performances but none of them really help to raise the energy level of the film.  Their characters are as staid as the image co-star Lyle Lovett creates for himself in real-life.  In sum, ""The Player"" earns some points for its accurate critiquing of Hollywood but one wishes such a message could have been delivered via a more entertaining production.",2,"""We do not arrest the wrong person.

28924,A1DSOF0EK9G06C,0780618564,Zarathustra,"[2, 3]","Robert Altman made 35+ films in Hollywood, but he was not a part of the studio system. He made films that he wanted to make, and those films were not the ones that the studios were interested in making. But because his films were made inexpensively, he was able to get them screened. The Player is a satire of the Hollywood studio system with Tim Robbins playing a studio executive and with many Hollywood insiders playing themselves.This film, like many of his films on DVD, comes with a director's (and in this case a screenwriter's) commentary. He calls The Player a mild satire. Altman was a maverick. You can gain valuable insights into Altman's world by viewing his commentaries. Since the studio system was all about making money and not about art, many disillusioned Hollywood actors liked to appear in his films, often for free. The plot for The Player is thin, but that's not what the film is about. It is about an inside look at a dying industry only interested in making money.",5,Altman's Parallel Universe,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,989,"['Robert', 'Altman', 'made', '35+', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'studio', 'system', 'made', 'films', 'wanted', 'make', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'ones', 'studios', 'were', 'interested', 'making', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'inexpensively', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'screened', 'Player', 'satire', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'system', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'playing', 'studio', 'executive', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'insiders', 'playing', 'themselves.This', 'film', 'many', 'films', 'DVD', 'director', 'case', 'screenwriter', 'commentary', 'Player', 'mild', 'satire', 'Altman', 'was', 'maverick', 'can', 'gain', 'valuable', 'insights', 'Altman', 'world', 'viewing', 'commentaries', 'studio', 'system', 'was', 'making', 'money', 'not', 'art', 'many', 'disillusioned', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'liked', 'appear', 'films', 'often', 'free', 'plot', 'Player', 'thin', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'inside', 'look', 'dying', 'industry', 'only', 'interested', 'making', 'money']",N/A
