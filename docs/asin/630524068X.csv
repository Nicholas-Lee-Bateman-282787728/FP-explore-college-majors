I saw it more than ten years ago, and then after re-watching it recently, I was pleased to be reminded how entertaining and beautiful it was.  My favorite part is the first hour.  Tatjana Trieb as the young Lara is magnificent.  The way she describes sounds to her deaf parents, interprets on their behalf; her chemistry with the other actors and fit in the family are so natural, so perfect.  She has charisma galore, and it is a shame she isn't in more films.  She is one of the best child actors I've ever seen.  Story of Lara, who plays the clarinet, which serves to separate her from her father, who is deaf.  Her father, Martin, is afraid of losing her.  Martin feels like an outsider from his hearing family, does not understand how his whole family caters to him, and he is especially jealous of his sister, Clarissa, who plays the clarinet.  Clarissa is very unhappy, does not love her husband, seems to covet what her brother Martin has and feels marginalized by her family.  There is the lovely Kai, played by Emmanuelle Laborit, who is Lara's mother, who is friendly and matter-of-fact about her deafness, encouraging her daughter to succeed, going so far as to laugh at her younger daughter, Marie friend's screams to prove her deafness, and encouraging Lara to play the clarinet, even buying her concert tickets to understand.  I empathized with Martin's frustration and fear; Clarissa's own unhappiness, Clarissa's husband's sadness, but I really disliked the older Lara.  My first complaint of the film was Sylvie Testud; she just didn't seem to fit, and perhaps if Tatjana Trieb wasn't so superb as the young Lara, I wouldn't have a complaint, but Sylvie Testud was so drab.  I also disliked the melodramatic exchange between Lara and her father at the end.  But the first hour is marvelous, really stellar.",4,"This is really a beautiful, special film",1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,1850,"['like', 'movie', 'lot', 'saw', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 're-watching', 'recently', 'was', 'pleased', 'be', 'reminded', 'how', 'entertaining', 'beautiful', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'first', 'hour', 'Tatjana', 'Trieb', 'young', 'Lara', 'magnificent', 'way', 'sounds', 'deaf', 'parents', 'interprets', 'behalf', 'chemistry', 'other', 'actors', 'fit', 'family', 'are', 'so', 'natural', 'so', 'perfect', 'charisma', 'galore', 'shame', ""n't"", 'more', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'child', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Story', 'Lara', 'who', 'clarinet', 'separate', 'father', 'who', 'deaf', 'father', 'Martin', 'afraid', 'losing', 'Martin', 'feels', 'outsider', 'hearing', 'family', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'whole', 'family', 'caters', 'especially', 'jealous', 'sister', 'Clarissa', 'who', 'clarinet', 'Clarissa', 'very', 'unhappy', 'not', 'love', 'husband', 'covet', 'what', 'brother', 'Martin', 'feels', 'marginalized', 'family', 'lovely', 'Kai', 'played', 'Emmanuelle', 'Laborit', 'who', 'Lara', 'mother', 'who', 'friendly', 'matter-of-fact', 'deafness', 'encouraging', 'daughter', 'succeed', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'laugh', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Marie', 'friend', 'screams', 'prove', 'deafness', 'encouraging', 'Lara', 'play', 'clarinet', 'even', 'buying', 'concert', 'tickets', 'understand', 'empathized', 'Martin', 'frustration', 'fear', 'Clarissa', 'own', 'unhappiness', 'Clarissa', 'husband', 'sadness', 'really', 'disliked', 'older', 'Lara', 'first', 'complaint', 'film', 'was', 'Sylvie', 'Testud', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'perhaps', 'Tatjana', 'Trieb', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'superb', 'young', 'Lara', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'complaint', 'Sylvie', 'Testud', 'was', 'so', 'drab', 'also', 'disliked', 'melodramatic', 'exchange', 'Lara', 'father', 'end', 'first', 'hour', 'marvelous', 'really', 'stellar']",Beyond Silence VHS

Yeah, most german movies i have seen so far are mostly for the comedy aspect in the way their characters interact, i find  that along with the drama that occured w/ the main character, this is a  very inspring film!  The main character grew up before your eyes, amazing  you how she delt with her every-day situations, translating for her parents  stuff on the television and what her peers and teachers what they wanted to  say to her parents.  Of course, being a little girl, the humor is when she  doesn't quite translate it word for word.  This movie has inspired me to be  more serious to my language study.  I might want to even to expand to ASL.  All that I know is that this movie was good, and is viewable by everyone.  There is no bad scenes only inspiring ones! This which leads to my second  question, why isn't this movie avalible on DVD yet?  This movie, if they  did a little more advertising, would be a summer DVD sale hit!  Trust my  word on it.

Laura, as a hearing daughter of deaf parents, she is expected to interpret everyday situations for them. Her parents demand more of her than the average child.

This film is also about Laura trying to balance her role in the deaf world and the hearing world and questioning which world she belongs to.I loved watching the beautiful and graceful German Sign Language and comparing GSL to ASL. I also loved listening to the clarinet; I had no idea how beautiful that instrument sounds!

The 9-year-old Laura is a real sparkler.We knew a couple of sisters who were friends of our daughters whose parents were deaf, and we found little Laura to be very much like those girls.  It is a great movie to show children how the lives of some of their friends can be very much different from their own.  Then, to teach them that, unlike some of the kids in the movie who were mean to Laura, if we understand the friend's life from his or her point of view we can and should be nice to them.  This movie gives a real feel for the experiences and unique frustrations of a hearing child of deaf parents.The movie is pretty much the usual child finally wins the approval of a disapproving parent story.

Although her parents can function without Lara, her parents have come to depend on her as a link to the 'hearing' world, even though she is very, very young.Needless to say, the deafness of her parents has created interesting personality dynamics in Lara's world.  One of the most strained relationships is between Lara's father and his sister Clarissa.  When Clarissa introduces Lara to the clarinet, this is something that Lara latches on to, even though her parents can't comprehend the music she's playing.  Because of this, and because it is Clarissa who wants her to keep at it, her parents are less than overjoyed.  The film revolves around Lara growing up and excelling at playing the clarinet, and the decisions she has to make if she wants to pursue her music at a higher level.  None of the characters are transparent or superficial; one gets the idea of their thoughts and their reasonings by the way they act and interact with one another.The DVD is in German, with options for English subtitles or English for the hearing impared (It would be sad if they didn't; after all, this is a film about deaf people.)

The child enters adulthood very quickly and has a very overdeveloped sense of responsibility. The downside of caretaking at a young age is that the child has no time to discover who they are and what they want out of life. They are the parent who cares and nurtures instead of being the child who should be builded up, edified and protected.Such is the charming but wrenchingly melancholy story of BEYOND THE SILENCE, Academy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language Film of 1997. Lara is a precocious ""hearing"" child born to two deaf parents. Lara has becomes the ears to the outside world for her parents who wish to keep her  totally for themselves in their world of quiet. But Lara suffers in the world outside her home. She cannot be what she needs to be. Her reading suffers and she longs to find the expression that is beyond words and beyond the silence. The key to her breakout comes when her Aunt Clarissa gives Lara a clarinet. Lara's parents are threatened that they will lose Lara to a world that they have not been able (and perhaps willing!) to enter. Alot has to be said for the family dynamics presented in this film.Anyone who has been misunderstood or held down by their parents whims or misunderstandings will benefit greatly from viewing this subtle and well-told story of  a close-knit family that has to learn to understand each other's world.

I think the father resembles closely a Boris Becker add a few extra pounds.This film dramatizes the Deaf and hearing worlds in an entertaining and provocative way that touches deep.",5,Maturing Collision of Two Worlds,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,825,"['exquisite', 'delightful', 'film', 'hearing', 'daughter', 'deaf', 'parents', 'father', ""n't"", 'fully', 'matured', 'deafness', 'reconciled', 'previous', 'family', 'issues', 'daughter', 'fully', 'matured', 'understanding', 'deaf', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'who', ""n't"", 'fully', 'matured', 'integration', 'hearing', 'world', 'deaf', 'world.Catalyst', 'daughter', 'musical', 'gift', 'clarinet', 'causes', 'reaction', 'brother-sister', 'daughter-father', 'young', 'adult', 'musician.Even', 'English', 'subcaptions', 'movie', 'grabber', 'romancer', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'acting', 'excellent', 'think', 'father', 'closely', 'Boris', 'Becker', 'few', 'extra', 'pounds.This', 'film', 'Deaf', 'hearing', 'worlds', 'entertaining', 'provocative', 'way', 'deep']",Beyond Silence VHS

It is the story of a young girl, the daughter of deaf parents, who is looking for her place in the world.  A common plot for movies -- but this film does not go for hollow sentimentality or cliches.  The characters are complex, and the plot has some surprising twists.  There are no villains, no overly dramatic emotional scenes; everything is realistically portrayed.  The ending is satisfying, and like life, not all questions are answered.  American film could learn a lot from this, especially in terms of eliciting real emotional responses from an audience.",4,Wonderful Inspirational Story,979689600,"01 17, 2001",2001,637,"['quot', 'Beyond', 'Silence', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'daughter', 'deaf', 'parents', 'who', 'looking', 'place', 'world', 'common', 'plot', 'movies', 'film', 'not', 'go', 'hollow', 'sentimentality', 'cliches', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'plot', 'surprising', 'twists', 'are', 'villains', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'everything', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'life', 'not', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'American', 'film', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'especially', 'terms', 'eliciting', 'real', 'emotional', 'responses', 'audience']",Beyond Silence VHS
