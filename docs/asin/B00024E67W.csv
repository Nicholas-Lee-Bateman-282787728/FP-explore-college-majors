824329,AVTQCYSEALAQ6,B00024E67W,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Thunderbolt is made in 1994, not 1995, I'm not chinese, but I saw the movie when I was 4 years. Thi s movie is all about action and drama. Chinese people like to make movie that have action and drama, they pretty much don't care about how the viewer understand the story, but understand the action, not the words. This movie is rent if you can find them at blockbuster, but why not spent $17.99 without looking for it. If you saw the Fast and Furious, this movie made before the Fast and Furious, and they use no special effect, and the best racing movie I've ever see. But forget about the racing, is the action is very Hollywood like, not joking, it the truth. Shooting and moving house is had very good action-effect realistic movie. The moving house is when Jackie Chan's in a Truck storage and sleep in it. The Bad guy pick his room up and crush to his Father and sister roomes. But most chinese movie had few or no good guy die in the movie, because if they did have alot of good guy die in the movie,than is not chinese movie and end up like making very sucky Hollywood movie that were made by the chinese. This movie is worth your time. See it! Buy or rent's your choice.

824330,A2G6JSQODJDRX8,B00024E67W,Bex,"[11, 12]","Dark Jackie. Yes, pretty much that sums it all up in Thunderbolt (A.K.A. Dead Heat), a not-so-easy-to-find film of Jackie Chan's. It was made right after his hit ""Rumble in the Bronx"" when his ankle was still broken and as I understand it (which could be wrong) Aaron Kwok, trained by Sammo Hung, did some of the stunt doubling. I like Aaron, so this is okay by me. Now, as the title states, this is not your average happy-go-lucky Jackie film. He smiles all of twice in this film, is angry and driven, and I love it!Jackie works as a master mechanic in an autoshop his father runs. In his free time, Jackie helps the police with illegally upgraded cars. At one point, a bad guy named Cougar (What's with the animal bad guy names??) goes racing around, kills a cop at a blockade, Jackie jumps in a car to chase him down and, while not a racecar driver like Cougar, manages to best the baddie. The baddie is carted off to prison where his evil minions break him out not too long after. In the interim, a lovely female reporter stalks Jackie to get an interview about his brave act. Well, once Cougar is free, he wants revenge of course, and a rematch, so in one of the most brutal 6 minutes I've ever seen, Cougar tears Jackie a new one using a crane and Jackie's own house. Jackie's whole family is there as well, and all get the snot kicked out of them. One of his two sisters is kidnapped and one goes vegetable from shock and damage. His father, too, suffers a heart attack and Jackie rushes him to the hospital where only an injection, sneakily executed by a doctor, calms Jackie down.Cougar kidnaps both sisters, using them as insurance that Jackie will take his challenge to race him in a high-profile professional race. (I am not a racing fan, so I'm not sure if it was grand-prix, or what.) Of course, obstacles get in the way: the reporter gets a crush on Jackie and messes a few things up even as she tries for a good story that would threaten Jackie's sisters' safety, Jackie doesn't have a car that will work for what he needs, he's in emotional turmoil over his father and sisters, etc... How does it end? Watch and find out! As an avid Jackie fan, I own most of his movies and this one is in my top fave 8. It's awesome and I love Jackie's darker, angstier side. (He's scary when he's mad.) Plenty of action, too, and one of the coolest fights scenes ever in a casino full of Pachinko games. Don't get this movie hoping for light and laughs, it's not like that. This is grittier, edgier and awesome. (Though many claim this is movie is just a shameless plug for one of Jackie's other passions, racing.) I don't even mind the small romance subplot.

824333,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00024E67W,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 1]","I was very excited when I found out Thunderbolt had finally been released to dvd.  I was only able to find this title on cable television, and to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it exceeded my expectations.  The dvd release fortunately has a sharper image quailty than I expected too (I am used to most martial art dvds still having a fuzzy quailty).  The down side is the terrible dubbing, but if you can get used to that, Thunderbolt is an enjoyable experience.The most notable aspect of this movie is that it focuses more on racing than fighting, which is what we come to expect from Jackie Chan.  I expect that Chan has a passion for racing and cars and wanted to do this movie to have some fun with that.  If you are looking for some good ol' Chan fight scenes, there are a few that are ok.  The really good scene is a nice lengthy fight scene in a Chinese casino.  Chan fights off an army of men including the same guy he faced off for 15 minutes in The Legend of Drunken Master.If you like racing movies, this one actually pleases.  Near the beginning of the movie is a decent street race at night on the highway streets between Jacki Chan and his racer nemesis in the movie.  The final action scene in the movie, is not a Chan fight scene or stunt, but a rather lenghty - and good - race on the race track (kinda like Days of Thunder).  The only downside to the scene was that a few shots were clearly sped up on the film, but the suspense and crashes were great.The last thing to mention about Thunderbolt is the violence.  Its a bit bloodier than I am used to seeing for a Chan movie.  Some crazy things happen that made me squirm a bit the first time I watched this.  Apparently cable television didn't have a problem with it (ha).  I still don't believe its enough for an R rating, but its definetly more violent than most Chan films.Overall Thunderbolt is an extremely underrated and perhaps undiscovered Jackie Chan movie.  Expect the usually cheesiness with dubbed movies here, but other than that, its a great flick.",4,a different kind of Chan,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,2049,"['was', 'very', 'excited', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Thunderbolt', 'had', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'dvd', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'find', 'title', 'cable', 'television', 'surprise', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'dvd', 'release', 'fortunately', 'sharper', 'image', 'quailty', 'expected', 'too', 'am', 'used', 'most', 'martial', 'art', 'dvds', 'still', 'having', 'fuzzy', 'quailty', 'down', 'side', 'terrible', 'dubbing', 'can', 'get', 'used', 'Thunderbolt', 'enjoyable', 'experience.The', 'most', 'notable', 'aspect', 'movie', 'more', 'racing', 'fighting', 'what', 'come', 'expect', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'expect', 'Chan', 'passion', 'racing', 'cars', 'wanted', 'do', 'movie', 'have', 'fun', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'ol', 'Chan', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'ok', 'really', 'good', 'scene', 'nice', 'lengthy', 'fight', 'scene', 'Chinese', 'casino', 'Chan', 'fights', 'off', 'army', 'men', 'including', 'same', 'guy', 'faced', 'off', '15', 'minutes', 'Legend', 'Drunken', 'Master.If', 'racing', 'movies', 'one', 'actually', 'beginning', 'movie', 'decent', 'street', 'race', 'night', 'highway', 'streets', 'Jacki', 'Chan', 'racer', 'nemesis', 'movie', 'final', 'action', 'scene', 'movie', 'not', 'Chan', 'fight', 'scene', 'stunt', 'rather', 'lenghty', 'good', 'race', 'race', 'track', 'kinda', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'only', 'downside', 'scene', 'was', 'few', 'shots', 'were', 'clearly', 'sped', 'up', 'film', 'suspense', 'crashes', 'were', 'great.The', 'last', 'thing', 'mention', 'Thunderbolt', 'violence', 'bit', 'bloodier', 'am', 'used', 'seeing', 'Chan', 'movie', 'crazy', 'things', 'happen', 'made', 'squirm', 'bit', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Apparently', 'cable', 'television', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'ha', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'enough', 'R', 'rating', 'definetly', 'more', 'violent', 'most', 'Chan', 'films.Overall', 'Thunderbolt', 'extremely', 'underrated', 'perhaps', 'undiscovered', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', 'Expect', 'usually', 'cheesiness', 'dubbed', 'movies', 'here', 'other', 'great', 'flick']",Thunderbolt
824334,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00024E67W,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Here be SPOILERS.Made in 1995, THUNDERBOLT is the redheaded stepchild of Jackie Chan's film oeuvre; it's not your typical happy-go-lucky Jackie Chan flick. This film spews out a vigorous blend of frenetic car chases, pulse-pounding fight sequences, and, oddly enough, a dramatic acting turn by Jackie Chan. THUNDERBOLT tells the story of former race car champion Chan Foh To (Jackie Chan) who ends up on a gangster's crap list. It all starts when Foh, now an auto repair mechanic, accompanies his father, who, every now and then, is called upon by the police to identify specially modified cars which are then towed away on suspicion of illegal street drag racing. On one such occasion, Foh witnesses a speed racer who evades capture and fatally runs down a policeman. Later, Foh engages the same speedster in a hazardous street race and manages to lead him straight to the police, where he is summarily apprehended.Things get even more serious when it's discovered that the speed freak is none other than Warner ""Cougar"" Krugman, an influential criminal wanted by Interpol. A bribery attempt by Cougar's henchmen fails to dissuade Foh from coming forward as a witness against Cougar. However, Cougar means to get his vengeance on against Foh and, furthermore, aims to get another shot at racing him. With those intentions in mind, he kidnaps Foh's two younger sisters. But Cougar underestimates the resiliency and determination, not to mention the driving skills and arse-whoopin' talent, of Chan Foh To...Don't mistake THUNDERBOLT for one of Jackie's patented, lighthearted comedy-action romps. He's pretty serious here as he and the dramatic storyline dismiss all tendencies to go for the giggles. As apropos to Jackie Chan's films, the action sequences are again exhilarating to watch. I understand that some if not most of the stunts are, this time, performed by a double as Jackie had incurred an ankle injury in his prior feature RUMBLE IN THE BRONX and wasn't able to fully step up to the plate. But the stunts mostly don't suffer for it as we get to murmur appreciatively at the high standard sequences in Foh's garage and in the pachinko parlor (for pachinko, think pinball machines). One complaint is that, at times, the action director resorted to that disjointed, blurry, slo-mo stuff - I'm not impressed. Meanwhile, the film's somber tone really sinks in during Cougar's traumatic razing of Foh's residence and place of business. I had never seen Jackie so beat up and so vulnerable as in that sequence and also in the ensuing emotionally wracked scenes at the hospital. Jackie has never invested so much emoting than when he was grieving over his cardiac-arrested father or, subsequently, when he is questioned by intrepid Interpol agent Steve Cannon (Michael Wong, who, by the way, doesn't really look Caucasian).Another move off the beaten path for Chan (or, at least, in my viewing experience of his flicks) is the minutiae in which he involves the viewer regarding race car driving. This movie contains a decided element of THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, which THUNDERBOLT does precede. There are two races showcased here: a fairly exciting one early on which takes place in the streets of Hong Kong, the other an extended (it's friggin' 13 minutes long!) official race car competition on a Japanese speedway. Now, NASCAR fans might warm to the auto chases, but, to me, it only meant that a bit of human kinetic vitality was drained away to make room for the vroom-vroom! energy of the film and, now, there's even less time for further fight scenes.As mentioned, Jackie's acting is above par this time, and I must say the audience's viewing experience will be enchanced by screening the film in sub-title format, rather than in dub. Jackie, like most actors, instantaneously improves as an actor when seen and heard in his native language. Anita Yuen is the half-hearted romantic interest/obligatory female fluff here and plays the annoying, go-getter reporter Amy Yip, who kinda redeems herself at the end. Thorsten Nickel portrays the villain Cougar the same way a cabbage would portray the villain Cougar, and he unwittingly provides most of the rare humor that's in the film. Nickel's pretty dang abysmal.I'm giving THUNDERBOLT three stars. I feel the only things that hold it up are Jackie's unusual foray into serious drama (which might draw in the curious) and the always reliable chop-socky beatdowns. The plot is blah, the pace of the film is jarring at times, and there aren't enough good acting performances. It's also the fact that I found out Jackie didn't do all his stunts this time out. And, maybe, in the end, I really was too disconcerted by the lack of Jackie's brand of over-the-top comedy. Yeah, maybe that's it.",3,Not your typical Jackie Chan vehicle,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,4747,"['Here', 'be', 'SPOILERS.Made', '1995', 'THUNDERBOLT', 'redheaded', 'stepchild', 'Jackie', 'Chan',

824337,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B00024E67W,Mantis,"[1, 1]","Jackie Chan flicks rarely escape my notice.  Especially one from the mid-'90s, where his output was consistently exciting.  I had heard so little about ""Thunderbolt"" that when I found it used/cheap I had almost completely forgotten that it even existed.  For a few dollars I couldn't pass it up and while I don't necessarily regret purchase, the ambiguity of the film's hype became more and more apparent as it played.  To call this uneven would be a drastic understatement.The film starts in Tokyo where Hong Kong mechanic Foh (Chan) and his team are working at a Mitsubishi testing facility before heading home, where he resides with his father and two younger sisters.  When not working on cars he helps local police nab fast & furious street racers.  While out with the fuzz one night, a driver known as Cougar (Thorsten Nickel), who the cops are already after, leads them on a high-speed chase that results in one dead officer.  While revealing his impeccable driving skills, Foh helps capture Cougar, who wants nothing more than to get out of jail and race Foh at some big rally, back in Tokyo.The opening credits should've indicated that something was off, as director Gordon Chan's (""Fist of Legend"") name appears several mentions before ending with ""A Jackie Chan Film"". I brushed it off and watched anyway, wondering about a half hour into the thing why I hadn't heard more about this flick, as I was totally into it.  ""Not enough fights"" was the hypothesis I used to temporarily comfort myself.  That theory was contradicted within a few minutes by a terrific Chan-against-many fight that, apart from a few dubious camera angles, was flawless.  Now I couldn't give crap-one about auto racing but this flick was rockin' until, just moments later, it takes an abrupt turn with Foh fabricating a statement to keep Cougar detained before an excessively violent jail-break, followed by Foh and his family being put in semi-sadistic peril.  Cougar kidnaps the two sisters and leaves pops in cardiac arrest with the threat of their death should Foh not show in Tokyo.  Foh gathers his team and goes about getting a car for the big race.There's more involving a romance/media sensationalism subplot but fans of Chan want to see the action and, sadly, there's not enough of it to go around.  Other than the good fight that I mentioned earlier there is only one other.  While large scale and ambitious, taking place at a Tokyo casino and involving several opponents, including a group of Yakuza, its inclusion of nearly two sustained minutes of blurry slo-motion pulls the energy right out of it.  There is no climactic fight either.  It ends with a race.  A rather boring one.In the film's defense, there were production problems galore and Chan was still injured from ""Rumble In The Bronx"" when filming took place.  But why a movie is not good should never concern a viewer.  That's for the producers.  Let Leonard Ho worry about that crap!  I would think that Chan's integrity would prevent him from doing action scenes with a double, especially during his vintage era, but nope.  This is especially wasteful when a fan like me becomes aware that the stunts & fights are a collaborative effort between the stunt-teams of both Chan and Sammo Hung!  Again on the uncharacterisic scale, Hung's choreography comes off much more Corey Yuen-like than his own history would dictate.This Golden Harvest production comes to DVD from New Line Cinema with very good quality.  Flip-disc full or widescreen option with languages available in original Cantonese or English dubbed.  Spanish or English subtitles available, too.  No special features except for some DVD-ROM stuff that I didn't bother checking out.  This would be a good film if you could turn it off after about 37 minutes.  Everything after that is questionable and I cannot recommend it except to Chan completists.  The fact that the film is relatively humorless is refreshing but if you want to see a good, serious Chan flick with only two fights, check out ""New Police Story"" instead.1995.  aka: Dead Heat",2,"""Not only does he race cars, he's a killer.""",1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,4064,"['Jackie', 'Chan', 'rarely', 'escape', 'notice', 'Especially', 'one', ""mid-'90s"", 'where', 'output', 'was', 'consistently', 'exciting', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'little', 'Thunderbolt', 'when', 'found', 'used/cheap', 'had', 'almost', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'even', 'existed', 'few', 'dollars', 'could', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'regret', 'purchase', 'ambiguity', 'film', 'hype', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'apparent', 'played', 'call', 'uneven', 'would', 'be', 'drastic', 'understatement.The', 'film', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'mechanic', 'Foh', 'Chan', 'team', 'are', 'working', 'Mitsubishi', 'testing', 'facility', 'heading', 'home', 'where', 'father', 'two', 'younger', 'sisters', 'When', 'not', 'working', 'cars', 'local', 'police', 'fast', 'furious', 'street', 'racers', 'out', 'fuzz', 'one', 'night', 'driver', 'known', 'Cougar', 'Thorsten', 'Nickel', 'who', 'cops', 'are', 'already', 'high-speed', 'chase', 'results', 'one', 'dead', 'officer', 'revealing', 'impeccable', 'driving', 'skills', 'Foh', 'capture', 'Cougar', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'get', 'jail', 'race', 'Foh', 'big', 'rally', 'back', 'Tokyo.The', 'opening', 'credits', 'should', ""'ve"", 'indicated', 'something', 'was', 'off', 'director', 'Gordon', 'Chan', 'Fist', 'Legend', 'name', 'several', 'mentions', 'ending', 'A', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Film', 'brushed', 'off', 'watched', 'anyway', 'wondering', 'half', 'hour', 'thing', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'more', 'flick', 'was', 'totally', 'Not', 'enough', 'fights', 'was', 'hypothesis', 'used', 'temporarily', 'comfort', 'theory', 'was', 'contradicted', 'few', 'minutes', 'terrific', 'Chan-against-many', 'fight', 'apart', 'few', 'dubious', 'camera', 'angles', 'was', 'flawless', 'Now', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'crap-one', 'auto', 'racing', 'flick', 'was', 'rockin', 'just', 'moments', 'later', 'abrupt', 'turn', 'Foh', 'fabricating', 'statement', 'keep', 'Cougar', 'detained', 'excessively', 'violent', 'jail-break', 'followed', 'Foh', 'family', 'being', 'put', 'semi-sadistic', 'peril', 'Cougar', 'two', 'sisters', 'pops', 'cardiac', 'arrest', 'threat', 'death', 'should', 'Foh', 'not', 'show', 'Tokyo', 'Foh', 'team', 'getting', 'car', 'big', 'race.There', 'more', 'involving', 'romance/media', 'sensationalism', 'subplot', 'fans', 'Chan', 'want', 'see', 'action', 'sadly', 'not', 'enough', 'go', 'around', 'Other', 'good', 'fight', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'large', 'scale', 'ambitious', 'taking', 'place', 'Tokyo', 'casino', 'involving', 'several', 'opponents', 'including', 'group', 'Yakuza', 'inclusion', 'nearly', 'two', 'sustained', 'minutes', 'blurry', 'slo-motion', 'energy', 'right', 'climactic', 'fight', 'either', 'race', 'rather', 'boring', 'one.In', 'film', 'defense', 'were', 'production', 'problems', 'galore', 'Chan', 'was', 'still', 'injured', 'Rumble', 'Bronx', 'when', 'filming', 'took', 'place', 'why', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'should', 'never', 'concern', 'viewer', 'producers', 'Let', 'Leonard', 'Ho', 'worry', 'crap', 'would', 'think', 'Chan', 'integrity', 'would', 'prevent', 'doing', 'action', 'scenes', 'double', 'especially', 'vintage', 'era', 'nope', 'especially', 'wasteful', 'when', 'fan', 'aware', 'stunts', 'fights', 'are', 'collaborative', 'effort', 'stunt-teams', 'Chan', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'Again', 'uncharacterisic', 'scale', 'Hung', 'choreography', 'off', 'much', 'more', 'Corey', 'Yuen-like', 'own', 'history', 'would', 'dictate.This', 'Golden', 'Harvest', 'production', 'DVD', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'Flip-disc', 'full', 'widescreen', 'option', 'languages', 'available', 'original', 'Cantonese', 'English', 'dubbed', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'available', 'too', 'special', 'features', 'DVD-ROM', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'checking', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'turn', 'off', '37', 'minutes', 'Everything', 'questionable', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Chan', 'completists', 'fact', 'film', 'relatively', 'humorless', 'refreshing', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'serious', 'Chan', 'flick', 'only', 'two', 'fights', 'check', 'New', 'Police', 'Story', 'instead.1995', 'aka', 'Dead', 'Heat']",Thunderbolt

He also enjoys race car driving and helps the police capture a killer who also likes to race cars.  When Jackie outdrives the killer and helps the police catch him, the killer tells Jackie that he wants a real race.  In a couple of very illogical scenes the killer gets broken out of prison and kidnaps Jackie's sister.  Jackie has to race him to get his sister back.  The story is really bad and the only good thing about the movie is the action, but even that has its flaws.There is one very long action sequence where Jackie tries to rescue his sister.  Jackie fights about 20 people including Ken Lo who gets to show off his amazing kicking skills.  Jackie is doubled a lot, but it is the wirework and the way they shoot the scene that bugged me.  They use a weird frame rate and this action scene is way too stylized for my tastes.  On the positive side, there is some great stuntwork in this scene and a fantastic finsish.There is a lot of car racing and the car stunts are done very well.  Most Jackie Chan movies have a big final fight at the end, but this one ends with a mildly exciting car race.  But this race would have been a lot more exciting if it was better directed and if the story had more thought put into it.

Indeed, there's one amazing car stunt in the final race that has to be seen to be disbelieved, with car flipping over midair and landing upside down on top of another car as it races by: how the hell they shot that for real is beyond me.Best of all, despite the listings on most sites and some of the reviews posted here before the disc came out, New Line's DVD is the uncut Hong Kong version with optional English or Cantonese soundtrack and in a great 2.35:1 transfer.",4,"At last, a decent uncut release for one of Jackie's rarest films",1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,1203,"['odd', 'choice', 'may', 'be', 'many', 'ways', 'Thunderbolt', 'favorite', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'long', 'shot', 'even', 'far', 'best', 'very', 'slow', 'starter', 'going', 'best', 'stunts', 'not', 'least', 'time', 'not', 'played', 'laughs', 'when', 'punches', 'land', 'people', 'really', 'get', 'hurt', 'step-printing', 'scenes', 'bit', 'irritating', 'one', 'obvious', 'bit', 'doubling', 'fight', 'Pachinko', 'parlour', 'partially', 'shot', 'double', 'when', 'Chan', 'was', 'hospital', 'style', 'fighting', 'movement', 'noticeably', 'different', 'satisfyingly', 'down', 'dirty', 'car-chases-and-fights', 'number', 'thanks', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'choreographed', 'fights', 'Frankie', 'Chan', 'car', 'stunts', 'Indeed', 'one', 'amazing', 'car', 'stunt', 'final', 'race', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'disbelieved', 'car', 'flipping', 'midair', 'landing', 'upside', 'down', 'top', 'car', 'how', 'hell', 'shot', 'real', 'me.Best', 'listings', 'most', 'sites', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'disc', 'came', 'out', 'New', 'Line', 'DVD', 'uncut', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'version', 'optional', 'English', 'Cantonese', 'soundtrack', 'great', '2.35:1', 'transfer']",Thunderbolt
