Well by the looks of the way season 3 is selling on here maybe they will get the point that we dont want anymore of their &quot;CREATIVE&quot; tampering with our show!  Do the homework...Season 1 sold 488 copies....Season 2...281 (thats a big drop)....and Season 3... OUCHHHHH 5 sold so far!!! Wonder how that settles with the Columbia/ Tri Star?  I am done purchasing the Dawson Creek Series. A line has been clearly crossed with the elimination of the TITLE SONG and other key tracks in this season 3 dvd release.  Its just not the same show anymore.  I suggest a RECALL and a revised edition released ASAP. These people need to learn that when we buy a season of a TV show... we want to re-live it as we remember it...not all redone.  This is far too depressing. Im over this.  Maybe someday as time passes someone will do Dawsons Creek justice on DVD. Till then the people who made this DVD can just jump in the creek!!!!,1,A LINE HAS BEEN CROSSED......WHAT A RIP!!!!,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,1052,"['ONLY', 'knew', 'how', 'disappointed', 'am', 'SHAME', 'moron', 'who', 'literally', 'butchered', 'favorite', 'show', 'save', 'buck', 'Well', 'looks', 'way', 'season', '3', 'selling', 'here', 'maybe', 'will', 'get', 'point', 'dont', 'want', 'anymore', 'quot', 'CREATIVE', 'quot', 'tampering', 'show', 'Do', 'homework', 'Season', '1', 'sold', '488', 'copies', '2', '281', 'thats', 'big', 'drop', '.and', 'Season', '3', 'OUCHHHHH', '5', 'sold', 'so', 'far', 'Wonder', 'how', 'Columbia/', 'Tri', 'Star', 'am', 'done', 'purchasing', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Series', 'A', 'line', 'been', 'clearly', 'crossed', 'elimination', 'TITLE', 'SONG', 'other', 'key', 'tracks', 'season', '3', 'dvd', 'release', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'show', 'anymore', 'suggest', 'RECALL', 'revised', 'edition', 'released', 'ASAP', 'people', 'need', 'learn', 'when', 'buy', 'season', 'TV', 'show', 'want', 're-live', 'remember', 'not', 'redone', 'far', 'too', 'depressing', 'Im', 'Maybe', 'someday', 'time', 'someone', 'will', 'do', 'Dawsons', 'Creek', 'justice', 'DVD', 'Till', 'then', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'DVD', 'can', 'just', 'jump', 'creek']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Third Season
821168,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B0002234R2,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Third Season is another good season but not the best. The first handful of episodes of this season are boring and completely strange with the introduction of the character Eve. After that the show starts to pick up speed with the whole Pacey/Joey/Dawson love triangle. I never liked Joey and Pacey as a couple but some of the romantic scenes that they have together are pretty explosive. Buy this if you were a fan of the series.

Tv is Tv, but when dawsons creek was on when i was a teenager, it became my whole world for that one hour.  The fact that Dawsons creek can still touch whoever watches it shows that ten years from now people will still be interested and fascinated by these characters.  Dawsons creek is perfectly crystallized art!  Season 3 marks, in my opinion, the beginning of a beautiful show.  The first two seasons lacked strong and interesting story lines...

821171,A22NQF87VKM11T,B0002234R2,Alex V,"[2, 3]","I know we're all pretty mad about the changed songs, especially about them changing the main title theme 'I Don't Want To Wait' by Paula Cole.  I see in a lot of the postings here that there is a lot of speculation about why they did that.  I was going over the DVD's special features and I noticed that on one of the commentary tracks they shed some light on issue.  There are excerpts of it in the main Amazon review, but below is the uedited statement:Executive Producer Paul Stupin quoted here from the DVD commentary of episode 310 'First Encounters Of The Close Kind':""You'll notice that there is a different song playing here over the main titles and this song by Jann Arden was used originally for the international release of the series; the first several seasons.  And I always loved it and I thought, well, let's mix up things a little bit.  Let's be a little creative.  And so we're putting the song on our third season DVD release and I think it's... it's just... again we've all heard the Paula Cole song 10,000 times and I thought it just might be a little bit different, a little more fun.  And also there was... I'll be honest, a little bit of an economic reality.  But, uh, anyway, I hope that you enjoy it.""So there you have it folks.  That is pretty much as official an answer as we are ever going to get.  Looks like Paula Cole wanted a truckload of money for the song in DVD distribution and the execs decided not to pony up the cash.I personally think the song was worth the extra money because the show seems different and almost... ruined because of it.  And that comment is not even considering the changed songs within the episodes themselves.  YES, the music is that important.It doesn't seem like they will change this course with season 4 and I think they are losing DVD sales that would have more than made up for the sum Miss Cole wanted.  I, for one, will not be buying the fourth season.Anyway, just wanted to throw in my 2 cents.

Well, music sets the mood in any show. You can't go without any sound. Otherwise your audiance would fall asleep. So changing the music in the show might make scenes better, but the theme song is what identifies the show. Look at CSI, you know when you hear the sound it's that show. So they wanted to get creative with the show.....you should have done it when it was on. leave it alone. At least if it was on the air you had the chance to see reactions from people. But because it's on DVD it's a little harder to return something if it's openned. For example, ace ventura pet detective. I liked the theatrical release, and have the VHS version, but when it came time to own the DVD. They changed it around and added new scenes,....and they suck. And you can't get the old version anywhere. It lost all the funny. Thats what happens when things get changed. Come out with directors cut and let the audiance decide. That way everyones happy.

Part of the reason I will not buy it is they changed the music. But what I can not forgive is the quality of the picture is not very sharp or good. It is not better than a good VHS copy. At times the picture looked grainy. Some have said they used compression because they did not want to include an extra DVD. This set should really have another DVD so the quality would be better, they would not have to cram so many episodes into one disc.While I love Dawson's Creek and would tell everyone to watch it on TBS, I can not reccomend this DVD set. I believe the studio will eventually get it right and re-release all the seasons with enough DVD's to keep picture quality high and will the original music.

He fell for Ethan, only to get his heart broken. Dawson and Joey seemed to be on different pages throughout the whole season. First she wanted him back, but he wasn't interested, then he wanted her back, but she wasn't sure if she wanted Pacey or him. The buildup to Pacey and Joey was really good, and made for good drama.

Mainly because of a new character called Eve (horrible actress Brittany Daniels), who bursts into Capeside and causes all kinds of havoc, and eventually she becomes a love interest for Dawson, and luckily she leaves after 6 episodes. Then the season gets on it's feet and quickly becomes the entertaining and dramatic show we all love. This is thanks to the wonderful storyline of Pacey and Joey falling in love with each other. Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes are excellent and their on screen chemistry is perfect. This arc continues for the rest of the season, and it will you get you hooked wondering what will happen next. Other highlights include giving Kerr Smith a more to do this season, and having him explore the gay lifestyle. Jenn falls for a freshmen quarterback, played with a lot of charm and sincerity by Michael Pitt. Dawson on the other hand, does nothing but mope around this season, and this is when the shows title should have been changed to Joey and Paceys Creek. The dvd collection is a disappointment as there are no behind the scenes featurettes or gag reels or anything. Just an interactive tour of Capeside.

821188,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002234R2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[30, 33]","The first episode I ever saw of &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; was when the gang graduated from Cape Side High School, at which point I learned that Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) was still a virgin, which certainly took a lot of the suspense out of &quot;The Complete Third Season.&quot; This is the season that convinces us that Pacey (Joshua Jackson) is serious competition for Dawson in the Joey (Katie Holmes) sweepstakes, not only because Dawson and Joey run hot and cold for each other on alternate timetables but also because Pacey can be awfully darn cute when he wants to be. Consequently his earnest pursuit of the clueless Joey remains the bright spot in a series where most of the characters get seriously sidetracked.Season Three begins with a series of oblique turns in the first episode, &quot;Like a Virgin.&quot; Joey is interested in Dawson, which should be a good thing, but he is fascinated by the mysterious Eve, a new bad girl in town and end up crashing his dad's boat and trying the whole &quot;Risky Business&quot; approach to making the money he needs to get the boat fixed. Jen (Michelle Williams) does a wonderful job of demolishing the school's head cheerleader, in a telling speech about what life will be like 25 years down the road, and in a twist of fate that defies logic in the high school I remember is made Head Cheerleader. Apparently now once Kevin Williamson was gone, the idea was to jerk the chains of the characters as often as possible.Eve continues to titillate and embarrass Dawson in turn, Jen gets to experience the joys of Homecoming Queen along with being Head Cheerleader (&quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;), Jack (Kerr Smith) joins the football team as the gay wide receiver (&quot;Homecoming&quot;), and Andie (Meredith Monroe) comes back from the sanitarium only to cheat on the PSAT (&quot;None of the Above&quot;) and then slowly but surely melt down again as the guilt eats away at her. When Jen decides to respond to the advances of the freshman quarterback that just has to be the most unbelievable thing she did in the entire run of the show, while Pacey having to deal with troubled little kid Buzz (Jonathan Lipnicki) just screams &quot;blatant attempt to increase the ratings.&quot; Only when the cast gets out of Capeside and goes off to Boston in &quot;First Encounters of the Close Kind&quot; to see what college life could be like do we remember why we like these characters or were rooting for them.Okay, so there is large downside to the third season of &quot;Dawson's Creek,&quot; but it is not like you should skip over the season and move on to the fourth because some things do happen here that you are going to want to remember later on. When Pacey gets the lead in the school play &quot; Northern Lights,&quot; that at least makes sense and when Joey's mural is defaced (&quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;) and the principal's job ends up in jeopardy because of his response (&quot;To Green, With Love&quot;) there is at least some idea Capeside is in the real world. But when Pacey actually kisses Joey (&quot;Cinderella Story&quot;), we are back on track big time, because each is so busy being concerned with what Dawson will think (&quot;Neverland&quot;) that they sort of forget to deal with what they think about what just happened. Of course they are immediately thrown together in intimate circumstances (&quot;Stolen Kisses&quot;), so that they can suffer for their unexpressed feelings, and we get to the season's best episode, &quot;The Longest Day,&quot; in which the triangle explodes and we can safely say that nothing will ever be the same again.Of course even if Dawson has not been interested in Joey all year that is no reason for him not to be interested now that Pacey wants her and the next thing we know Dawson and Pacey are having a macho grudge match during the Capeside Regatta (&quot;Show Me Love&quot;), where you just know that who wins the race will lose the girl. When you get to the point where Dawson and Pacey might start beating up on each other over Joey then things are getting promising. Never mind that Jen is still dealing with the kid quarterback, that Dawson is supposedly giving up his film-making career, and that we are still worried about the Potter Bed & Breakfast.This show comes down to Dawson, Joey, and Pacey, where any combination of the two is usually a good thing and having all three involved turns this into a twisted teenage version of the most famous love triangle of Arthur, Guenivere, and Lancelot. Even though this is the third of the show's six seasons, what happens at this point not only sets up the final episode with Joey's final choice, but retroactively recasts everything that happened previously so that it bears on how this triangle plays out. So three stars on the first half, five on the second, and we will split the difference overall.",4,Off track until the Dawson/Joey/Pacey triangle explodes,1090627200,"07 24, 2004",2004,4877,"['first',

Up until now, the show has been about Dawson and Joey's dysfunctional friendship/psuedo-romance.However, 4 important events guide this season to probably the most emotionally exhilarating season finale of the series: 1) a mysterious, sexy stranger named Eve turns up in Capeside and takes an interest in Dawson and Andie, 2)After apologizing for breaking up with him and holding his part in her father's reincarcination against him, Joey asks Dawson to take her back and offers to sleep with him. He rejects her and says they should just be friends. She is angry and hurt, 3)Dawson then asks Pacey to look after Joey for awhile to make sure she's okay. Pacey is hesitant to get involved in the situation, but agrees. 4) Pacey's girlfriend returns from a summer spent in a mental health facility and reveals she cheated on him. He is heartbroken and ends the relationship.After these events occur, we are treated to the wonderfully slow build up of the friendship, then romance between Pacey and Joey, which threatens their friendship with Dawson. One of the mosted heatedly debated triangles in television history thus begins and it drives the last three seasons of this teen soap. Many of the reviews on here are pretty much a testament to the division of most of Dawson's Creek fans into DJers (Dawson and Joey) and PJers (Pacey and Joey), so take what you will from the reviews. The same is true for S4-S6 reviews.So, I'm a Pjer and this is my favorite season not only for that reason, but because I think it showcases the casts' talent and has the best build-up to season finale of all the seasons. It's just very compelling.The Season 3 set has a fun Capeside Tour extra, it's 23 episodes on 4 discs, but unless you're a picture quality junkie, the picture quality is just fine and is the best on this season's DVDs compared to other seasons. Also, some of the bad reviews are also in relation to music that has been replaced due to cost. It's too bad, but I didn't follow the show closely when it aired, so it doesn't bother me at all.

While the scripts still contain the excess wordiness and self-analysis, but they don't have the same wit as the first two seasons.  Also, the season shows the drifting apart of Dawson (James Van Der Beek) and Joey (Katie Holmes) and the starting of the Joey &amp; Pacey (Joshua Jackson) romance.  Andie (Meredith Monroe) returns to Capeside and her relationship grows distant from Pacey.  The season contains a shocking revelation about Jen (Michelle Williams) and a mysterious new girl Eve (Brittany Daniels) and dives deeper in Jack's homosexuality as he faces intense scrutiny by playing for Capeside High's football team.  The season contains a Blair Witch Project inspired episode and one that is shown through three different perspectives (inspired by a Katie Holmes' movie Go).  The DVD producers did not want to ante up for music clearances (which happened in the first two season's releases), but it is more pronounced in this set as the show's signature and title song, Paula Cole's &quot;I Don't Want To Wait&quot; is not included.",3,Season Of Change,1089072000,"07 6, 2004",2004,1176,"['Season', 'three', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'was', 'period', 'change', 'series', 'Creator', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'left', 'show', 'absence', 'felt', 'scripts', 'still', 'contain', 'excess', 'wordiness', 'self-analysis', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'wit', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Also', 'season', 'drifting', 'apart', 'Dawson', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'Joey', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'starting', 'Joey', 'amp', 'Pacey', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'romance', 'Andie', 'Meredith', 'Monroe', 'Capeside', 'relationship', 'distant', 'Pacey', 'season', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'Jen', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'mysterious', 'new', 'girl', 'Eve', 'Brittany', 'Daniels', 'deeper', 'Jack', 'homosexuality', 'intense', 'scrutiny', 'playing', 'Capeside', 'High', 'football', 'team', 'season', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'inspired', 'episode', 'one', 'shown', 'three', 'different', 'perspectives', 'inspired', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'movie', 'Go', 'DVD', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'ante', 'up', 'music', 'clearances', 'happened', 'first', 'two', 'season', 'releases', 'more', 'pronounced', 'set', 'show', 'signature', 'title', 'song', 'Paula', 'Cole', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Want', 'Wait', 'quot', 'not', 'included']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Third Season
821195,A1CGF9EUDEUQJA,B0002234R2,Rodrigo Medina,"[3, 4]","The third season of ""Dawson's Creek"" is very important to the whole series plot, since the love triangle Dawson--Joey--Pacey emerges and that will influence the show until its end. At the beginning of the season, we find Dawson making new discoveries with a misterious and sexy blonde, Eve, which upsets Joey. Jen finally finds true love with the naive and passionate freshman, Henry, who is not ashamed to show his feelings for Jen in public places. Jack tries to take control of his gay life and struggles to give his first steps towards a real relationship, meeting a college guy, Ethan, who helps Jack to find out who he is. Pacey takes care of Joey, as requested by Dawson, but is surprised when the protection he gives becomes love. Joey also loves Pacey, but is frightened by Dawson's reaction and the fact that her soulmate may hate her.Many people are criticizing Columbia for the replacement of third season songs. Of course, music plays an important role in ""Dawson's Creek"", but the new songs chosen for the DVD release are not bad at all. The opening theme of third season is ""Run like mad"", by Jann Arden, which was also the opening theme outside US when the show was being broadcasted on TV. I kind of like this song, which is very related to the series spirit, and sometimes fits better than ""I don't wanna wait"", by Paula Cole.The final episode of third season, ""True love"", is great! I love the dialogues between Pacey, Joey and Dawson and it's great to see that Joey had the courage to make the right choice being with Pacey, in spite of Dawson's reaction.After all, you never know if something is really yours, until you let it go...If you are a fan of Dawson's Creek, this is a season you can't miss!

Now, on the package it said new music selected by one of the &quot;Higher-ups&quot; in making DC.  At first I thought okay, It's not gonna be so bad I mean they changed some music from the Second season and it wasn't completely ruined. Even Roswell changed some music in the DVD set!Boy was I WRONG!!!!  At least the Producers of Roswelll had the commmon sense to at least keep the opening theme of the show on.  BUT THESE IDIOTS CHANGED THE OPENING THEME FOR DAWSON'S CREEK!!!!!!!!!  How can you change the opening theme when, running on TBS, it is the same for re-runs and the other DVD's have the original theme song &quot;I Don't Wanna Wait&quot;.  The Producers are acting as idiots for changing this!!!!!!! I would not have minded if they would have to make us pay more money for this set; As long as it did not exceed $75.Now the reason it has only two stars taken away for the huge mistake they made in the music, I could never give DC a score of less than 3 out of 5 because the series was wonderful and it changed my life.  Everything was good until they left High School.  In case you don't know, this was the year that relationships really changed Joey became serious with someone else besides Dawson, and The group has a lot of changes in their lives this season!

Season three blew me away right from the get go, the sexuality of the show is ramping way, way up.. The teens of capeside are coming into there own and the maturity level is raising each episode. I will edit and and add to this review when season three is complete but thus far its deffinately not dissapointing. This show just isnt for the pre-teens, im in my 30's now and enjoying it 15-years after its debut.  I was somewhat skeptical of season one and season two got better. i can say im truly enjoying season 3Now after finishing the entire series i reflect back i think season 3 was by far the best.. well, season two and season three were the best.. and the two hour finale at the end of season 6 was just awesome. Im 36 years old and this show was (IT) durring my college years.. everyone was watching it (yes even us guys were following along) well after i graduated the show continued and i was not able to follow along.. so all these years down the road i ordered up this series and rewatched it..  times sure have changed.. i wish they would have had the original music, and i wish sesons 5&6 were better.. after rewatching all the episodes im looking forward to saving these DVD'S and letting my kids watch them as teens and getting there opinions.  rewatching this took me back to before kids, marriage, house payments, etc.etc.etc.  back to when the whole world was infront of me.. i was glad to revisit this time..

I'm sorry but I still am not too accepting of a Joey-Pacey belonging together mentality, but I love the show and I just keep hoping one day they have a reunion show to show that Joey and Dawson are always meant to be together (sigh, just wishful thinking). I know some people are sick of hearing all about the fans being up in arms over the music being changed but all I can say is ""Were you there from the beginning?? Did you spend every single Wednesday night watching this wondefully captivating, and for me nostalgic show about life, love, friendship, family?"" Until you were there for the whole ride, the music doesn't matter to those who never heard what it was before. For those who watched season 1, can you imagine the final scene of the season when Joey asks Dawson is he ready for all that comes with telling the truth and Dawson pauses and Joey turns to leave and ""say goodnight, not goodbye"" comes on? I would have been seriously upset if they had done one single thing to mess up the most perfect moment in that season. Well it's a similar instance in Seasons 2 and 3 and I think it really sucks that they changed the music. It's like them saying to those fans who love the show, ""we don't care if you love it like it is, and that you can associate music with certain scenes in the show, we just want to change it cause we can"". There hasn't been another tv show that's gone and changed the THEME MUSIC for DVD release. That part is just a pure outrage!!!! I can remember each episode watching them, and hearing the music begin before the opening scene ended and feeling so happy watching the intro. Now, I nearly puked when I first heard that AWFUL Jann Arden song. It's not only awful, it doesn't fit what I used to feel when that show first began. I just feel ripped off. I wasn't going to buy the dvd because I kept hoping all this uproar would make them re-release an unaltered version. I still pray they do, or atleast they don't EVER change the intro, and music again in the next 3 seasons and leave it the way it originally was. Why don't they offer a choice, like click here to here an alternate soundtrack and let people choose if they want to hear that hideous intro they've now added, or if people want to ""not mess with a good thing"" and hear Paula Cole. I pray if anyone reads this that is in any position to do something about this, PLEASE LET EM KNOW THE FANS WANT IT THEY WAY IT WAS! DO NOT MESS UP THIS GREAT SHOW BECAUSE THAT IS NOT FAIR TO THE FANS!!!!
