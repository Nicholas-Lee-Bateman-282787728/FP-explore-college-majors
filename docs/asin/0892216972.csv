167057,A1B79U197FOH05,0892216972,"G. M. Casey ""gcasem""","[3, 6]","How many times over the years, nay, decades, have we heard evolutionists say that they have been quoted out of context.  But it doesn't take much to give the lie to this oft-repeated dodge.  Take for example the portion of this presentation that deals with whale evolution in which evolutionists are given considerable freedom to express their frank opinions:Kevin Padian a very prominent paleontologist at Berkley says on camera that one would have to be blind or three-days dead not to see the evidence for whale evolution as he has seen at the University of Michigan.Two other experts, one from San Diego State University, the other from Howard University,  talked about Rodhocetus, a whale intermediate having had a fluke just like a modern whale.  One of these experts said that very few modifications were needed to make Rodhocetus into a whale.However, Dr. Gingerich of the University of Michigan who discovered and described Rodhocetus said he had not found the fossil evidence for the fluke and that he merely speculated on the animal having one.  He also said on camera that the fossil evidence he subsequently found for the forelimbs did not accord with its having flippers or a fluke.  It is interesting that the other experts are not aware of the actual state of affairs with Rodhocetus.My biology textbook that I use with my students also shows Rhodocetus with a very large fluke and with flippers.It's standard practice for those who have given quotes to backtrack and say that they were misquoted, such is the pressure from fellow evolutionists for having given ammunition to ""those creationists""(Please see Ben Stein's movie Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed which reveals the  severe persecution of scientists who dare to question Darwinism).  Anyone watching the above segment, however,  can see very plainly that the speakers were allowed to speak their opinions very freely.  There is no other conclusion than that there really is no whale evolution (especially when it is considered, as the film shows us, that ambulocetus, another fossil whale intermediate, has been sidelined, and that at least 3 different ancestors of the whale have been proposed, the hyena, a cat-like animal, and the hippopotamus; Darwin had proposed the bear).The segment with Dr. Timothy Rowe from the University of Texas is very interesting because he was interviewed at length.  He was interviewed regarding purported feathered dinosaurs from the Liaoning Province in China.  Dr. Rowe ran the cat- scan technology at the university and the movie producers tell us up front that he supports evolution.  Here are some of his findings:- one fossil which to the naked eye looked to him authentic, under the cat-scan revealed three layers.  The outer two layers were natural.  The middle layer had bits of metal and grouting.  He concluded that the fossil had been tampered with by humans.- the second one, Archaeoraptor, was a mosaic of several different rock fragments and five different animals, one of which was a dinosaur and another a bird.Regarding Archaeoraptor, Dr. Rowe told National Geographic scientists who had retained him to scan the fossil, what his findings were.  Still the scientists of Geographic held a news conference the next day declaring it to be a genuine feathered dinosaur and three months later published an article in their magazine heralding it as a major find.The reason, I think that creationists, tend to not reveal their identity to those who they are interviewing is so that they can get a frank opinion.  What the viewing public gets in this presentation Evolution: The Grand Experiment is the true state of evolutionary theory complete with its endless speculations and serious lack of evidence.Anyone who has seriously critiqued evolution over the years will have to agree with Dr. M. Giertych, population geneticist of the Polish Academy of Sciences, that evolution is a philosophy, not a science.There is much more in this DVD presentation and apparently much more material in the book that goes along with it.

Here, however, ""Dr."" Carl Werner has arrived at a new low point of Marianas Trench-like proportions for creationist duplicity, by misrepresenting both himself and his staff to eminent paleobiologists like Kevin Padian, Phil Gingerich, Phil Currie, Angela Milner, Tim Rowe, and Paul Sereno, who thought that this would be a credible scientific documentary on the history of life of the kind we have seen from PBS NOVA, the BBC and Oxford Scientific Films. Instead all the usual creationist canards are repeated, beginning of course with the absurd claim that there are no ""transitional fossils"" (However, this creationist observation has been refuted again and again with the discoveries of transitional whale fossils - found by Phil Gingerich and his colleagues in Pakistan and Egypt - transitional humanoid fossils, and of course, a major step in evolution, the colonization by vertebrates of the land, as noted in the discovery of Tiktaalik back in 2005 by a team led by vertebrate paleobiologist Neil Shubin, recounted in his bookYour Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body (Vintage).Don't waste your time buying this video and giving your money to a despicable mendacious intellectual pornographer like ""Dr."" Carl Werner. Invest your money instead in any of the superb NOVA episodes devoted to paleobiology or the documentaries produced by the BBC and Oxford Scientific Films. These are far worthier investments than picking up another risible example of creationist cinematic mendacious intellectual pornography.(EDITORIAL COMMENT 11/30/10: Someone asks if I was offended? Absolutely, as a former paleobiologist. However, how about any of the  distinguished scientists I mentioned who thought they were participating in a legitimate scientific documentary film of the kinds I have described, not some cinematic religiously-derived mendacious intellectual pornography? Werner and others of his ilk have forgotten that genuine ""scientific"" creationists were forced back in the mid 19th Century to alter their views once there was clear, persuasive, evidence of ""descent with modification"" (as Darwin described it) - better known of course as biological evolution - and that evidence has quite literally taken exponential leaps in the more than one hundred and fifty years since the original publication of Darwin's ""On The Origin of Species"".

These days missing links are called transitional forms. In the film many palaeontologists from various museums around the world are interviewed. We now have vast collections of fossils, but the transitional forms are still absent. It looks at fish, bats, seals and pterosaurs which are all fully formed in the fossil record, there are no transitional forms. The program discusses archaeopteryx, which may be a transitional form. Then it looks at the so called evolution of the whale, which included one example of extrapolation of data (the Rhodocetus fraud). And it finishes with the Chinese Archaeoraptor fraud which National Geographic published in 1999, but later retracted. All very interesting as it shows that the tree of life is assumed rather than proved. Duane Gish, author of ""Evolution? The Fossils still say NO!"" appears in the film a couple of times. The DVD must be good as all the evolutionists are giving it 1 star, it is rattling their cages, just as it should. It exposes the frauds of the evolutionists.

By lying to their subjects at the onset of filming, the producers were able to elicit comments concerning specific areas of evolutionary science where there are differing opinions - and by quote mining and deceptive editing they were able to ""intelligently design"" a film which ignores facts and established science.
