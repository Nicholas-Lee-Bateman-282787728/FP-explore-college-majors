There needs to be levels to work up to if it is to be called a beginner's session.  How do you keep up... skip this....try this....?  Do a minute of this, that,  skip......too hard here, etc., etc.  It becomes too difficult to keep up with if you are truly a beginner,  stiff and not able to stretch.Not sufficient instructionI have done some Yoga through a few videotapes, and I have compared beginner's instruction and noted that this is void of sufficient instruction for the beginner it targets.PosesYou may have difficulty getting to keep up with these poses, don't be discouraged and what may happen is when you can't keep up, you give up!Beautiful SceneryYes, the scenery is beautiful!!

The compelling thing about it is the music, the serenity of Elena Brower, and the need to slow down, just to consider getting into the Yoga world. If I had to compare the numbers of people who are considering this DVD who are experienced Yoga practitioners, to those who are inexperienced, the inexperienced viewers would probably outnumber the experienced by 10 to 1. So although I am not a seasoned practitioner, I like so many others have been studying it, and want to learn more. I learned from Deepak Chopra that Yoga is not a practice of breaking through your resistance levels, but rather going up to the wall where they exist, and gently staying there for a moment, and feel the resistance breaking down. Then when you keep arriving there, over time, the wall moves. With that in mind, Yoga becomes an easy practice.Will I be achieving the extent that Elena achieves in her poses? No, but I know over time I can keep moving in that direction. I have been advised by those well versed in the art to start with an instructor, and that is well taken advice. If you are as new to Yoga in practice as I am, you can relate to what I have to say. I am a guy, Elena is beautiful to watch, painted into the serene background, the music is done as tastefully as the DVD. From the moment you start the episode, you realize it is an artful professionally done work. The graphics, the settings all lend themselves to what you are trying to achieve. Peace, flexibility, strength, balance, and tone. I need to balance my other forms of exercise, treadmills and weight training, both of which needs the 3rd element, to maintain flexibility, and this DVD does that for me.",5,Beauty,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,1737,"['video', 'DVD', 'place', 'one', 'setting', 'serene', 'background', 'Hawaii', 'compelling', 'thing', 'music', 'serenity', 'Elena', 'Brower', 'need', 'slow', 'down', 'just', 'consider', 'getting', 'Yoga', 'world', 'had', 'compare', 'numbers', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'considering', 'DVD', 'who', 'are', 'experienced', 'Yoga', 'practitioners', 'who', 'are', 'inexperienced', 'inexperienced', 'viewers', 'would', 'probably', 'outnumber', 'experienced', '10', '1', 'am', 'not', 'seasoned', 'practitioner', 'like', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'studying', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'learned', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'Yoga', 'not', 'practice', 'breaking', 'resistance', 'levels', 'rather', 'going', 'up', 'wall', 'where', 'exist', 'gently', 'staying', 'there', 'moment', 'feel', 'resistance', 'breaking', 'down', 'Then', 'when', 'keep', 'arriving', 'there', 'time', 'wall', 'moves', 'mind', 'Yoga', 'easy', 'practice.Will', 'be', 'achieving', 'extent', 'Elena', 'poses', 'No', 'know', 'time', 'can', 'keep', 'moving', 'direction', 'have', 'been', 'advised', 'well', 'versed', 'art', 'start', 'instructor', 'well', 'taken', 'advice', 'are', 'new', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'am', 'can', 'relate', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'guy', 'Elena', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'painted', 'serene', 'background', 'music', 'done', 'as', 'tastefully', 'DVD', 'moment', 'start', 'episode', 'realize', 'artful', 'professionally', 'done', 'work', 'graphics', 'settings', 'lend', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'achieve', 'Peace', 'flexibility', 'strength', 'balance', 'tone', 'need', 'balance', 'other', 'forms', 'exercise', 'treadmills', 'weight', 'training', '3rd', 'element', 'maintain', 'flexibility', 'DVD']",Element: Yoga for Beginners

Beginners beware though, there is not a lot of detailed instruction and be careful with the pigeon twist. I think this is a level 2 (intermediate), but probably packaged to sell the product ;o)It is a very nice to follow along practice, but you should know something about alignment beforehand. Start with some centering/breathing, then quite a bit of standing poses. I love Anusara because they don't overdo sun salutations. You just do 2 sun s's, then move on to the standard triangle, warrior 2, etc (and not too fast). A very soothing ending on the floor (and you can even replace backbend with the 2nd round of bridge...although she doesn't mention it).Overall, this is a very good production and introduction to Anusara Yoga.

Very relaxing, both the breathing and the stretching are as relaxing as it is invigorating.The Lows:The middle of the DVD she gets into some Yoga positioning and really doesn't take the time for the newbie to follow along.  Also she switches positions and what not without telling you so if you are not watching the TV screen the whole time you miss some very vital stuff.I am not a beginner at Yoga, but most of my Yoga experience has been integrated with a Pilates based workout.  I watched the DVD twice before actually doing the exercises as when I do Yoga there are times I like to have my eyes closed.  That's next to impossible to do on the majority of the middle of the DVD.  A lot of the time you have to move fast and watch the whole time; I didn't like that at all.

(Although there are those that would argue you are always a beginner....)  I have a huge collection of yoga dvds which span different levels - mainly because I like to tailor my practice to suit my needs.  There are times when I need something gentler - when my energy level is low,  when I've been ill, the day after a tough power yoga workout...Anyhow. This is not a super easy workout, and the name is a bit off, true...  Thing is, for the first year or so I considered myself a beginner.  This would have been perfect for me after two or three months.  So, yes, in that sense it is a beginner's level.  But not a true beginner.To be totally fair, nobody should EVER learn yoga just from dvds and books.  One should attend classes and use these aids on the side or after having passed a certain level.On a very personal level, I bought an Elena Brower yoga CD years ago which is beautiful but a little too advanced for me.

1107793,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,B000WC38B4,drebbles,"[0, 0]","Nicely filmed in a beautiful location near the Pacific Ocean, ""Yoga for Beginners"" begins with an introduction by instructor Elena Brower explaining who she is, what the program will consist of, and what you will need to do the exercises (a yoga mat, bare feet, loose clothing, and a towel and water if you want). Once the introduction is over, the program starts with several minutes focussed on establishing your breathing. The program starts off slowly, picks up pace towards the middle, and slows down considerably towards the end with a nice long cool-down period. You have two viewing choices: watch the DVD from the beginning or select from five chapters: Breathing and Warm Up; Standing Poses/Sun Salute; Twists/Hip Opener; Back Bends; Forward Bends/Stretch.I've never done yoga before and I found ""Yoga For Beginners"" to have some good points and bad points for a true beginner. I loved the opening where you focus on your breathing (even if I tended to inhale when she says to exhale and vice versa); it was a good way of getting into the mood for the exercises. I also liked the way Brower introduced various yoga terms into the routine. She often returns to the downward facing dog or mountain pose positions so they quickly became familiar to me. Brower also has plenty of rest periods set into the routines. With the chapters options it's easy to forward to the cool down section if the exercises become too much for a beginner. And the cool-down section is wonderful and very relaxing.There were a couple of things I didn't like about the DVD. I had a hard time with the placement of the mat - I positioned it like Brower did which was initially fine, but she then moved to the front of the mat, which meant I had to keep turning my head sideways to see what she was doing which was very awkward. And, while the DVD is for beginners, and starts off nice and slow, it picks up pace as it goes along and became a bit too fast for this beginner.

1107794,A969VLBBX8LQ7,B000WC38B4,George McAdams,"[2, 2]","In ""Yoga for Beginners,"" a 50 minute DVD , Elena Brower takes one though the paces of a beginner workout in a relaxed and casual setting.Her approach is in a true yoga fashion: low-keyed with full explanations of how one gets into the various yoga positions; explanations of what one should feel at first and what one will eventually feel in each position; and, the right-way, and wrong-way, one can do a position.For almost a year I have been attending a twice-a-week Pilates class that is supplemented with yoga.  It is taught by four instructors, all who have a similar, yet, sometimes unique, approach to their class.  All are excellent.With Ms. Brower's DVD, I found the consistent approach that comes with the use of a DVD comforting and predictable, especially for a beginner.Ms. Brower does a great job in developing the beginning yoga disciple.  I found the DVD approach is MUST because without it, I tend to get off-track and do what I find enjoyable, instead of doing everything as it was intended.I would recommend this DVD to anyone considering yoga.  It is excellent!  If you find yoga fits your bill, I would suggest that you get a book that shows the positions.  That way you can look at them at your leisure to make sure you are doing them correctly.As with my Pilates class, Ms. Brower stresses that you should not over extend yourself, or do anything that you feel is hurting your body.BTW, I mentioned about the benefits of yoga.  For years, I had some lower back aches that erupted into a serious problem for me this past year.  After going to the orthopedic surgeon several times and getting mixed results, I began doing Pilates because I had heard of its benefit for the back muscles. Within a month, I began to notice that my problem was less after my Pilates, and yoga, sessions.  My doctor told me that most lower back pain comes from not stretching out the hamstring muscles.  Knock on wood, it's been almost two months since I've had those pains.  While my situation may have been unique to me, in hindsight, I would recommend to anyone in their 20's and 30's to learn some yoga or Pilates and how to stretch their muscles.

Thanks to this DVD I was able to get a grasp on the varying positions and movements involved in yoga.  It definitely isn't easy the first time trying to follow along to this DVD.  In fact, it's almost impossible since many of the movements involve turning your body and your head in a way that you can't even view the TV screen while watching.  Thankfully, the guide vocal assists in making the correct movements.  Nonetheless, don't expect to get everything right on the first try.As a beginner, I did find it difficult being able to pull and stretch my arms, legs, head, and shoulders to the degree presented here.  I suppose that it takes much more practice!  I could definitely feel the pull on my muscles, so much that I had to take breaks while watching it.  It's not something that most people will be able to perform on their first try.While I've only started watching this DVD I can already feel differences in my muscles and in my body after only the first few workouts.

For the most part the camera manages to capture the various poses well enough for a beginning student to follow.The instruction beginnings slowly with a series of breathing excercises, moving on through standing and then stretching poses closing with more breathing/relaxation.  The poses didn't seem too complicated when I was just watching but when I tried to follow along my perception changed.  I have no experience with yoga, which makes me a true beginner.  I lasted just over ten minutes the first time through which lead me to my first problem.  Should I pause the dvd, rest and then resume?, stop and try to get further the next time? skip to the final section?  There really was very little support for the true beginner which leads me to think that this DVD would be better suited to someone who has had at least some yoga instruction before attempting this.The instructor did mention modifying some poses, particularly towards the end of the session but some of these instructions were only mentioned, not demonstrated.  For example the instructor stated that it was very important to flex the foot while executing one pose but did not explain exactly what she meant by that direction.  It would have been helpful if there had been a close-up of her foot at that point so the student could have seen what was meant.Overall though this is a good excercise DVD, one that has introduced at least this couch potato to a new way to excercise despite inclement weather or a busy schedule.",4,Maybe not exactly for a beginner,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,1620,"['beautiful', 'DVD', 'setting', 'stunning', 'music', 'narration', 'are', 'balanced', 'well', 'so', 'overwhelms', 'other', 'most', 'part', 'camera', 'capture', 'various', 'poses', 'well', 'enough', 'beginning', 'student', 'follow.The', 'instruction', 'beginnings', 'slowly', 'series', 'breathing', 'excercises', 'moving', 'standing', 'then', 'stretching', 'poses', 'closing', 'more', 'breathing/relaxation', 'poses', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'complicated', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'watching', 'when', 'tried', 'follow', 'perception', 'changed', 'have', 'experience', 'yoga', 'true', 'beginner', 'lasted', 'just', 'ten', 'minutes', 'first', 'time', 'lead', 'first', 'problem', 'Should', 'pause', 'dvd', 'rest', 'then', 'resume', 'stop', 'try', 'get', 'further', 'next', 'time', 'skip', 'final', 'section', 'really', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'support', 'true', 'beginner', 'think', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'least', 'yoga', 'instruction', 'attempting', 'this.The', 'instructor', 'did', 'mention', 'modifying', 'poses', 'particularly', 'end', 'session', 'instructions', 'were', 'only', 'mentioned', 'not', 'demonstrated', 'example', 'instructor', 'stated', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'flex', 'foot', 'executing', 'one', 'pose', 'did', 'not', 'explain', 'exactly', 'what', 'meant', 'direction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'had', 'been', 'close-up', 'foot', 'point', 'so', 'student', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'meant.Overall', 'good', 'excercise', 'DVD', 'one', 'introduced', 'least', 'couch', 'potato', 'new', 'way', 'excercise', 'inclement', 'weather', 'busy', 'schedule']",Element: Yoga for Beginners

I have a hard time imagining a yoga novice would be able to follow along. One is expected to know what many of the postures are without discussion, and things move strongly and quickly. The only real rests are downward dogs until the backbending section (which finally provides a few crocodiles).While Elena shows a mastery of graceful pose transitions, the choice of pigeon pose and the forward half split are odd beginner choices. Someone who is not very strong will need to create rests a few times, even though none of the poses are complicated. A strong, more advanced beginner will enjoy this DVD, however.

I have done Tai Chi and Chi Gung and related stretching but I know nothing about Yoga, so this is truly a ""beginners"" experience for me.You will need a yoga mat or soft carpet, comfy clothing, and to be barefoot to participate.There is a lot of on-the-floor stretching and twisting, some of which where your mid section is elevated with palms and feet on the floor.  There also is standing and stretching.The instructor is Elena Brower, a certified Anusara Yoga instructor, who states she has been practicing for 15 years and teaching for 10 years.  She has a studio in Manhattan.Elena begins briefly discussing how this is an uplifting and empowering activity and the need to breathe properly and stabilize your breathing.  She shows you how to breathe.Elena provides step-by-step instructions of how to sit properly in relaxed posture and breathe to produce a mind/body connection that provides cumulative affects.  The video backdrop is a small elevated square on green grass, overlooking the ocean, and landscaped with beautiful flowers and trees.  The feeling of beauty and serenity is enhanced with ""OM"" chanting softly in the background or sometimes soft extended musical/vibrational tones, and occasionally a few tinkles on the piano keys.  I also heard what sounded like some charka balancing vibrational toning in the background during one part.This DVD is loaded with many yoga poses and tips about the specifics of how to stand, bend move, breathe, etc.  She SHOWS you how to do everything, step-by-step.  Personally, I wish I would have found material like this years ago, but it's never too late.  The visual clarity is great.  The scenic backdrop is colorful and beautiful.  The soundtrack is courtesy of Todd Norian at deeppeaceyoga website.  The DVD cover claims that Elena's clients include Gwyneth Paltrow, Minnie Driver, and Rebecca Romijn, among others.Total time 51 minutes.

Not only is there no preliminary explanation of what we are doing and why, but also no general explanation of Yoga concepts and how postures fit into that.So, if you have done a few Yoga classes, know what it is about, and simply want a good Yoga program for home practice, this is fine, but if you are wondering ""What is this Yoga thing people are doing?"", then this is not the right DVD for you.",3,"Good, but missing some things",1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,1132,"['am', 'someone', 'who', 'done', 'Yoga', 'postures', 'years', 'never', 'sustained', 'intensive', 'way', 'am', 'also', 'quite', 'familiar', 'most', 'Eastern', 'spiritual', 'health', 'techniques', 'having', 'done', 'lot', 'meditation', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'Gong', 'well.I', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'quite', 'well', 'produced', 'workout', 'well', 'structured', 'However', 'everything', 'done', 'conform', 'standard', 'New', 'Age', 'style', 'expectations', 'logos', 'intro', 'look', 'other', 'similar', 'DVD', 'music', 'straight', 'New', 'Age', 'massage', 'session', 'other', 'words', 'never', 'annoying', 'also', 'quite', 'conventional.Overall', 'Yoga', 'program', 'suited', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'Yoga', 'classes', 'local', 'park', 'school', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'preliminary', 'explanation', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'why', 'also', 'general', 'explanation', 'Yoga', 'concepts', 'how', 'postures', 'fit', 'that.So', 'have', 'done', 'few', 'Yoga', 'classes', 'know', 'what', 'simply', 'want', 'good', 'Yoga', 'program', 'home', 'practice', 'fine', 'are', 'wondering', 'What', 'Yoga', 'thing', 'people', 'are', 'doing', 'then', 'not', 'right', 'DVD']",Element: Yoga for Beginners

As Elena Brower states in the beginning, viewers need to take things at their own pace and only do the movements to where they are comfortable.  That said, I found it to be a great starter DVD, yet intense enough that even as one progresses, the yoga workout will still challenge you if you push yourself. If you feel yourself to be a beginner,Yoga For Inflexible Peoplemight be another disc to try.As a practitioner of Bickram yoga, I found this to be a more soothing and less intense alternative.  Elena's soothing voice guides you through a very complete workout and with her perfect posing in a lush environment, it is a pleasure and inspiration to watch and workout to.Other reviewers have done a good job dissecting the disc so I won't go there.

It's a mildly challenging workout with a good vinayasa sequence and focuses on lots of hip opening poses.  Beginners should just go at their own pace.  For example, I've been doing Yoga for about three months now and Chaturranga is still a very challenging pose for me.  I still have to do the modified version with knees on the floor.  Nearly all beginner video's show it in the unmodified form but I just go at my pace and remember that someday I will be able to do the full version.There are two poses that I found difficult, one was a variation on the pigeon pose and the other a deep hip opening lunge variation.  The pigeon pose was especially challenging but if you go at your own pace, don't sink down to the floor but stay up on your arms and rest if you need to, it's accessible to even beginners.  I found that by conciously relaxing and using my breath I was able to get my elbows to the floor the first time I tried it.  The lunge variation was easier although more awkward at first.  I had to repeat it several times in a row before I felt comfortable with it.  It really does make your hips feel great and challenges your balance with the side twist.The rest of the video is done at a challenging pace but still good for beginners and the poses are pretty basic.  I've done this video three times now and I have a feeling it will continue to be one of my favorites.  It's got beautiful scenery, a nice combination of poses, and the instructor is great.

Also, the instructor gives very specific directions regarding breathing and positioning, and I dearly wanted feedback about whether I was actually doing what I was supposed to.The pacing also seemed slow to me.  Granted, I may be a bit ADD, but 45 minutes is more than I can spare for a regular exercise routine at this point in my life.I guess it depends on what you want from a yoga DVD.  This particular DVD seems like a very serious introduction to learning and practicing yoga, as opposed to a yoga DVD that might less orthodox.  My favorite yoga DVD is Stress Relief Yoga, which keeps my attention by moving at a rapid pace (20 minutes), and completely relaxes me.  I have fallen asleep on the floor after doing that DVD!!  That DVD, however, has many reviews criticizing it for moving too quickly and not holding poses long enough.So I'd recommend this DVD for anyone who has a yoga instructor and wants to work on poses and stretches at home, for anyone who wants to undertake a serious study of yoga (but then I'd recommend an instructor!), or for anyone who wants a 45 minute yoga regime and is confident they understand positioning and breathing.",4,"Gorgeous DVD, but not really for the total beginner....",1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,1374,"['beautifully', 'filmed', 'high', 'quality', 'DVD', 'gorgeous', 'setting', 'skilled', 'model', 'calming', 'voice', 'walking', 'breathing/movements.As', 'pretty', 'much', 'total', 'beginner', 'found', 'DVD', 'bit', 'long', 'Also', 'instructor', 'very', 'specific', 'directions', 'regarding', 'breathing', 'positioning', 'dearly', 'wanted', 'feedback', 'was', 'actually', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'to.The', 'pacing', 'also', 'seemed', 'slow', 'Granted', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'ADD', '45', 'minutes', 'more', 'can', 'spare', 'regular', 'exercise', 'routine', 'point', 'life.I', 'guess', 'what', 'want', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'particular', 'DVD', 'very', 'serious', 'introduction', 'learning', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'opposed', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'might', 'less', 'orthodox', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'Stress', 'Relief', 'Yoga', 'attention', 'moving', 'rapid', 'pace', '20', 'minutes', 'completely', 'relaxes', 'have', 'fallen', 'asleep', 'floor', 'doing', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'however', 'many', 'reviews', 'criticizing', 'moving', 'too', 'quickly', 'not', 'holding', 'poses', 'long', 'enough.So', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'work', 'poses', 'stretches', 'home', 'anyone', 'who', 'undertake', 'serious', 'study', 'yoga', 'then', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'instructor', 'anyone', 'who', '45', 'minute', 'yoga', 'regime', 'confident', 'understand', 'positioning', 'breathing']",Element: Yoga for Beginners

1107821,A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z,B000WC38B4,"Santeria ""Son of Tazz""","[2, 2]","This DVD has quite a good introduction to what is usually known as Yoga.The mind and body elements are very well represented in the description of the moves, as well as the narrative of the DVD ""Class"".The audio and visual elements that supplement the class are well crafted. Staying with the voice of the teacher was a good move, sinceshe has a very good tone of voice, key in the teaching of any of the schools, as well as being superbly photogenic.I have done a variety of classes since the 1970s ( as a student), and the traditionalist schools are rarely as accessible as depicted in this DVD. Most of the teaching of YOGA ( YUKTA) can either aim for physical union with God ( not simply healthy responses) or good relaxation techniques that allow one to follow certain paths to access God.Whilst the state aim of ""Build Strength,Increase flexibility, calm your mind and revitalise your body"" is a necessary by-product of most advanced teaching in YOGA, the basic forms in the original Sanskrit are very difficult. What we have here is a very westernised form of the Traditional Yoga. As several of my teachers taught me, you getfrom the class what you take to it: if you want this to be a starting point it can be. You can try easing gently into some of the moves, but if it is too much for you, then freeze the DVD frame, and see how you can modify the move so that you still keep the ""beat"" but also keep the ability to develop. Its a very good Disc... if you can't doany of the moves, I can definitely recommend it as a meditation guide; what you do is see your ""inner self""  doing the moves... you might be surprised just how fulfilling this can be.",5,Elemental Yoga,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,1658,"['DVD', 'quite', 'good', 'introduction', 'what', 'usually', 'known', 'Yoga.The', 'mind', 'body', 'elements', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'represented', 'description', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'narrative', 'DVD', 'Class', '.The', 'audio', 'visual', 'elements', 'supplement', 'class', 'are', 'well', 'crafted', 'Staying', 'voice', 'teacher', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'sinceshe', 'very', 'good', 'tone', 'voice', 'key', 'teaching', 'schools', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'superbly', 'photogenic.I', 'have', 'done', 'variety', 'classes', '1970s', 'student', 'traditionalist', 'schools', 'are', 'rarely', 'as', 'accessible', 'depicted', 'DVD', 'Most', 'teaching', 'YOGA', 'YUKTA', 'can', 'aim', 'physical', 'union', 'God', 'not', 'simply', 'healthy', 'responses', 'good', 'relaxation', 'techniques', 'allow', 'one', 'follow', 'certain', 'paths', 'access', 'God.Whilst', 'state', 'aim', 'Build', 'Strength', 'Increase', 'flexibility', 'calm', 'mind', 'revitalise', 'body', 'necessary', 'by-product', 'most', 'advanced', 'teaching', 'YOGA', 'basic', 'forms', 'original', 'Sanskrit', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'very', 'westernised', 'form', 'Traditional', 'Yoga', 'several', 'teachers', 'taught', 'getfrom', 'class', 'what', 'take', 'want', 'be', 'starting', 'point', 'can', 'be', 'can', 'try', 'easing', 'gently', 'moves', 'too', 'much', 'then', 'DVD', 'frame', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'modify', 'move', 'so', 'still', 'keep', 'beat', 'also', 'keep', 'ability', 'develop', 'very', 'good', 'Disc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'doany', 'moves', 'can', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'meditation', 'guide', 'what', 'do', 'see', 'inner', 'self', 'doing', 'moves', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'fulfilling', 'can', 'be']",Element: Yoga for Beginners
1107822,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B000WC38B4,Sebastian Fernandez,"[0, 0]","There are countless options for products geared towards Yoga for beginners, but this is the first DVD I watched that has all the elements that I think should be present in a product like this. In many other cases, I have found that the asanas are too elementary, and after a month of following the lessons you are ready to move to something else. This DVD has a very nice flow, starting with a few minutes of breathing exercises and then moving on to your typical Yoga 101 asanas, setting up the next step. The pace starts to increase a little and there are some slightly more difficult poses, transforming this into a yoga flow practice, with poses that will challenge you for a while.For the absolute beginner, there is a very brief intro before the practice starts, mentioning the benefits of Yoga and the way in which it should be practiced. The only fault I found is that there is no mention to the fact that you should not eat in the couple of hours before a session (unless it is a very light snack). And then, there is the setting! The spirituality of yoga is partly lost when you get a DVD with people practicing in a bland studio. In this case the beautiful scenery definitely helps with the mood. As does the fact that instead of talking and demonstrating the poses simultaneously, the instructor is just focusing on the practice and we get her voice-over with the commentary.The advice on how to do the postures right is clear and to the point, and even though some beginners may be challenged as the DVD progresses, I think that in a couple of weeks you should be able to follow the flow of the lesson with no major problems. This is an excellent choice to get into yoga, especially if you are looking to increase your overall well-being, as well as your tone and flexibility.

Ive done yoga in a studio and own a few other Yoga DVD's that I really enjoy so I already know the poses and know what to expect and my other DVD's have instructors that cater to all levels; one DVD I own has three instructor each dressed in a different color and they tell you at the beginning that the instructor in blue is for a beginner and red is for an intermediate and green for the expert so you can watch the person who's level you are at and as you have more experience you don't need to run out and buy another DVD, you just watch the instructor on the next level. Another video I own gives you suggested modifications depending on your level and flexibility. Yoga for Beginners does none of these things. So, what I meant when I said it was a shame that this DVD was not properly titled is that it is a great DVD for someone who already has experience doing yoga NOT the beginner and I feel that a lot of people who have no experience with yoga are going to be unhappy with their purchase. What I love about yoga is it's the type of discipline where you should always go at your own pace but that being said what is lacking on this DVD is suggested ways to modify a pose to meet a physical limitation or just getting the basic poses down you. So, I think that an absolute beginner is going to get pretty frustrated pretty quickly and most likely never pick it up again.

The camera/lighting & sound are high quality & elegant.Elena Brower is very relaxed, encouraging & friendly in her voice over like a true yoga teacher should always be. She uses both the English & Sanskrit names for each pose, she gives the true spiritual yoga body placement guidance, such a ""breathe into your back"" (meaning to put your focus on relaxing your back & imagining oxygen going there) or ""open your heart"" (relax your chest) which keeps your mind with your body instead of just a plain body only focused Westernized workout like some yoga dvds. She gives great cues, she shows you even what it looks like to do downward dog incorrectly (great teaching style), she goes slow into & out of poses as well as slowly in & relax out slightly & back in until your body relaxes into the some of the poses fully. She has great body awareness & is courageous enough to do poses I'd never seen such as twisted lunge.I am an advanced beginner/low intermediate after 5 years of practice. This is not for only intermediates. This would be challenging for people who are VERY inflexible, or out of shape, but she does show modifications, is encouraging & even doesn't go as full/deep into the poses like Rodney Yee's, etc. You are never expected to go as deep as they are the first time, especially when you're new & to expect so is to only cause yourself stress. This goes against the entire principle of yoga which is to relax & be aware & enjoy your OWN body, not compare yourself to another.

1107829,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,B000WC38B4,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""","[29, 34]","For a while now, a friend has been urging me to consider practicing yoga.  With that in mind, I've been looking into various books and videos, and finding them generally either too physically demanding or too involved in the spiritual side of yoga practice.  I'm sorry to say that ""Yoga for Beginners"" is no exception, in spite of the name.  In fact it might be more properly titled ""Yoga for Beginners Who are Otherwise Quite Strong and Flexible.""In an approximately 50 minute workout, Elena Brower demonstrates a beautiful, flowing workout which looks like it must feel wonderful, if you can manage to follow it.  Unfortunately I have neither the strength nor the flexibility to do so.  I'm guessing that most of my friends don't either, so it does seem to me that it might be a good idea to offer hints for modifications of the poses to suit older, heavier or simply out-of-shape students.  But Brower offers very little in the way of such modifications.  I'd guess that about two-thirds of the workout is simply not do-able for me without substantial modification.At the same time, the poses themselves look quite wonderful, and if you've ever done stretching and/or deep breathing exercises, the pleasure of these poses will be almost palpable to you.  Brower's voice is calming.  She doesn't rush you through the poses, but at the same time she doesn't spend a lot of time explaining them.  Because the practice is slow and deliberate, this isn't as big a problem as it might be during an aerobics video, but as a beginner, I'd have appreciated a bit more information.Right at the beginning, Brower suggests that the deep breathing is far more important than a deep pose.  I think it would be helpful if she reiterated that during the actual workout.Over all, it's a pretty, calming video as long as you don't allow yourself to get too torqued if you can't do the moves, or you fall out of them frequently.  If you can make the necessary modifications for your own fitness level, you may well get something out of this video.  Otherwise, keep looking for a good beginning yoga workout.  There must be one out there.",3,The title is a bit misleading,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2121,"['while', 'now', 'friend', 'been', 'urging', 'consider', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'various', 'books', 'videos', 'finding', 'generally', 'either', 'too', 'physically', 'demanding', 'too', 'involved', 'spiritual', 'side', 'yoga', 'practice', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'exception', 'spite', 'name', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'properly', 'titled', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'Who', 'are', 'Otherwise', 'Quite', 'Strong', 'Flexible', 'approximately', '50', 'minute', 'workout', 'Elena', 'Brower', 'beautiful', 'flowing', 'workout', 'must', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'can', 'manage', 'follow', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'do', 'so', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'most', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'either', 'seem', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'offer', 'hints', 'modifications', 'poses', 'suit', 'older', 'heavier', 'simply', 'out-of-shape', 'students', 'Brower', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'such', 'modifications', ""'d"", 'guess', 'two-thirds', 'workout', 'simply', 'not', 'do-able', 'substantial', 'modification.At', 'same', 'time', 'poses', 'look', 'quite', 'wonderful', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'stretching', 'and/or', 'deep', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'pleasure', 'poses', 'will', 'be', 'almost', 'palpable', 'Brower', 'voice', 'calming', ""n't"", 'rush', 'poses', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'explaining', 'practice', 'slow', 'deliberate', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', 'problem', 'might', 'be', 'aerobics', 'video', 'beginner', ""'d"", 'have', 'appreciated', 'bit', 'more', 'information.Right', 'beginning', 'Brower', 'deep', 'breathing', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'deep', 'pose', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'reiterated', 'actual', 'workout.Over', 'pretty', 'calming', 'video', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'get', 'too', 'torqued', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'moves', 'fall', 'frequently', 'can', 'make', 'necessary', 'modifications', 'own', 'fitness', 'level', 'may', 'well', 'get', 'something', 'video', 'Otherwise', 'keep', 'looking', 'good', 'beginning', 'yoga', 'workout', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'there']",Element: Yoga for Beginners

The instructors voice and presence are soothing, the background (hanging gardens overlooking the Pacific) are breathtaking and the music is serene and effective.The practics starts with:1.  Breathwork and Warm-up.  This includes sitting while practicing Ujjayi breathing and warming up the legs with light lunging and standing forward bend.2.  Standing Poses and Sun Salutations. The series starts with 2 modified Sun Salutations and then a series of standing poses including, Warrior 1 & 2, Triangle, Side Angle Pose and a Side Angle Twist3.  Hip Openers.  The Hip Openers started with Pigeon Pose which I think is a bit difficult for a true beginners with no training from a teacher..4.  Backbends.  I like the Backbend series here for beginners.  It starts with a light cobra, then moves on to a modified locust pose series.  It ends with a counterpose to release the backbends which feels nice.5.  Forward Bends/Stretch/Relaxation.  This is all a nice calming series ending with a short meditation.Overall, I give this DVD 4 and 1/2 stars taking off 1/2 star because I think this is really for an advanced beginner.  There is not enough mention of foot, knee, and/or hip alignment and I think it would be very easy to injure your joints without this knowledge.  A tutorial in the beginning of the DVd would have been perfect.  Maybe with a lined mat showing beginners where to place their feet.",4,4 &1/2 stars!
