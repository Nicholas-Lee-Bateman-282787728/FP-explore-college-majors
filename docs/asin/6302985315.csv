349111,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,6302985315,drkhimxz,"[1, 1]","How good to see three superior professionals, in the last days of the Old Hollywood, producing a nicely Old Fashioned comedy with a twist. George Marshall directs Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds in a comedy uncluttered by any higher meaning or social significance. Carl Reiner, who did begin life as a comedian and actor, does as well as he was allowed to, as the Best Friend, with John McGiver turning in one of his characteristically funny bits. Glenn Ford, one of the most reliable stars of the era beginning in the 40's, does particularly well as the harried TV writer-director, who is paying blackmail to keep early 'pictures' of his wife out of the papers, while Debbie Reynolds is as charming as ever, abetting his comedic efforts. Carl Reiner is kept in check so that we see little of what made him one of the memorable figures of early television as one of the Sid Caesar Club, but fits in well as the best friend, a County Prosecutor, who has to  question him over a missing blackmailer.Happily, at least to these aging eyes, the film has lost little in more than sixty  years, in its capacity to entertain. I have no way of predicting how well it will be received by the younger crowd, but it should still be a good choice for those whose tastes were not formed solely in recent decades.",5,Entertaining Comedy Made (1959) in the Last of the Eisenhower Years,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,1297,"['How', 'good', 'see', 'three', 'superior', 'professionals', 'last', 'days', 'Old', 'Hollywood', 'producing', 'nicely', 'Old', 'Fashioned', 'comedy', 'twist', 'George', 'Marshall', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'comedy', 'uncluttered', 'higher', 'meaning', 'social', 'significance', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'who', 'did', 'begin', 'life', 'comedian', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'allowed', 'Best', 'Friend', 'John', 'McGiver', 'turning', 'one', 'characteristically', 'funny', 'bits', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'one', 'most', 'reliable', 'stars', 'era', 'beginning', '40', 'particularly', 'well', 'harried', 'TV', 'writer-director', 'who', 'paying', 'blackmail', 'keep', 'early', ""'pictures"", 'wife', 'papers', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'as', 'charming', 'ever', 'abetting', 'comedic', 'efforts', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'kept', 'check', 'see', 'little', 'what', 'made', 'one', 'memorable', 'figures', 'early', 'television', 'one', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'Club', 'fits', 'well', 'best', 'friend', 'County', 'Prosecutor', 'who', 'question', 'over', 'missing', 'blackmailer.Happily', 'least', 'aging', 'eyes', 'film', 'lost', 'little', 'more', 'sixty', 'years', 'capacity', 'entertain', 'have', 'way', 'predicting', 'how', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'received', 'younger', 'crowd', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'tastes', 'were', 'not', 'formed', 'solely', 'recent', 'decades']",Gazebo VHS

Schryer,"[4, 4]","Although he never received an academy award -- or even a nomination -- Glenn Ford was was of the most consistently outstanding actors of the Golden Age of movies. Somehow he excelled at everything from action and adventure movies to romance and comedy. His light touch is just right for this Hitchcock-like comedy in which Ford reluctantly attempts to kill a man who is blackmailing his wife -- played by the ever-delightful Debbie Reynolds -- over some nude pictures she posed for in her teens. Everything which can go wrong for Ford's character hilariously does go wrong -- except, of course, for the comedic twist of fate, involving a pigeon he rescues, which provides a very funny happy ending.

The result is a comic chaos involving a couple of gansters, a peculiar pigeon, and the gazebo his wife is having built on their country property.Based on the play of the same name, THE GAZEBO strives for a mix of broad farce, screwball comedy, and sprightly sophistocation--and by and large brings it off quite well.  I have never been a great fan of Glenn Ford, but he manages both the broad physical comedy and the clever dialogue of this film with equal ease.  Debbie Reynolds is also quite good in the role of the stage-star wife, and she and Ford have a surprisingly successful chemistry.  Although the humor is more smile-and-chuckle than laugh-out-loud, THE GAZEBO is a well made, well acted, and quite enjoyable.
