1385798,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B0045O2PG4,ajsteele,"[0, 0]","Coyote County Loser appears to be a low budget entry that holds together due to a tight family orientated script. The ""fish out of water"" premise plays better than usual because it avoids making the man the clueless ape. An LA hip guy with radio skills stumbles into rural Coyote County only to go at odds with the female ""love doctor"" of the town. His goal? To get the biggest loser in the town to go out with  HER, his ""relationships are like cars"" radio opposition.This was a Netflix gamble for me that gave some above board interest because of the ""romantic"" tension between the two leads. The film plays like a big safe worded high school play that gets it right. The male and female stars have no name recognition to me but deserve some praise for there exposition of quickwittedness that keeps a steady hum ""gotcha"" throughout.Finally a film that shows a professional woman that doesn't have all the emotional answers to love. And smartly, the film shows how all men are not super tool users and mechanics as well. The two butt heads with the female radio host becoming unarmed by this guys bravado yet still desiring to hold onto her core belief system.A few more twists and turns prevent the traditional road to an ending. A subplot with two misfit radio staff young adults goes nowhere and drudges up the films hokey origins while displaying some real bad acting. One reveiwer mentioned a ""Hallmark"" film. I see that clear as day in this better than average quickie.Ultimately though the film could stir up an argument or two if watched with your significant other which means it effectively projects humanity. The low end style of film making does detract. Some indoor shots look like the road crew was used for regular speaking lines. I saw a recognizable face in the female radio stars mom, it was the woman who played Supermans mother in the Lois and Clark tv show. Hey, there's something.  But, the amature look of the movie prevails as it becomes an almost forgetable film saved by some punchy lead roles. I can see why a romantic would appreciate it though. I have to say, in this film, I wouldn't mind getting the girl (with some modification).",3,Hits some highs,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,2162,"['Coyote', 'County', 'Loser', 'be', 'low', 'budget', 'entry', 'together', 'due', 'tight', 'family', 'orientated', 'script', 'fish', 'water', 'premise', 'better', 'usual', 'making', 'man', 'clueless', 'ape', 'LA', 'hip', 'guy', 'radio', 'skills', 'rural', 'Coyote', 'County', 'only', 'go', 'odds', 'female', 'love', 'doctor', 'town', 'goal', 'get', 'biggest', 'loser', 'town', 'go', 'out', 'HER', 'relationships', 'are', 'cars', 'radio', 'opposition.This', 'was', 'Netflix', 'gamble', 'gave', 'board', 'interest', 'romantic', 'tension', 'two', 'leads', 'film', 'plays', 'big', 'safe', 'worded', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'right', 'male', 'female', 'stars', 'have', 'name', 'recognition', 'deserve', 'praise', 'exposition', 'quickwittedness', 'steady', 'hum', 'gotcha', 'throughout.Finally', 'film', 'professional', 'woman', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'answers', 'love', 'smartly', 'film', 'how', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'super', 'tool', 'users', 'mechanics', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'butt', 'heads', 'female', 'radio', 'host', 'becoming', 'unarmed', 'guys', 'bravado', 'yet', 'still', 'desiring', 'hold', 'core', 'belief', 'system.A', 'few', 'more', 'twists', 'prevent', 'traditional', 'road', 'ending', 'subplot', 'two', 'misfit', 'radio', 'staff', 'young', 'adults', 'nowhere', 'up', 'films', 'hokey', 'origins', 'displaying', 'real', 'bad', 'acting', 'One', 'reveiwer', 'mentioned', 'Hallmark', 'film', 'see', 'clear', 'day', 'better', 'average', 'quickie.Ultimately', 'film', 'could', 'stir', 'up', 'argument', 'two', 'watched', 'significant', 'other', 'effectively', 'projects', 'humanity', 'low', 'end', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'detract', 'indoor', 'shots', 'look', 'road', 'crew', 'was', 'used', 'regular', 'speaking', 'lines', 'saw', 'recognizable', 'face', 'female', 'radio', 'stars', 'mom', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'Supermans', 'mother', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'tv', 'show', 'Hey', 'something', 'amature', 'look', 'movie', 'almost', 'forgetable', 'film', 'saved', 'punchy', 'lead', 'roles', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'romantic', 'would', 'appreciate', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'getting', 'girl', 'modification']",Coyote County Loser
