That, however, does not a bad movie make.  If one treats the movie and book as separate entities, then one can better judge each.  This movie is about a very serious woman who has lost touch with all of her childhood innocence and fantasies.  From age five until her tenth birthday, Jane had an imaginary friend named Michael.  They did everything together.  They are so close that they even finish one another's sentences.  They make up stories about people they observe and are, in every sense of the word, best friends.  On Jane's tenth birthday, at Tiffany's, Michael must leave to go on to be with another child.  Jump 20 years into the future.  Jane is a grown-up, beautiful professional woman in Manhattan.  She is the theater manager at her mother's theater.  She is very serious and focused on her career and upcoming wedding.  Michael returns as a grown-up and attempts to pick up where they left off when he was forced to leave 20 years earlier.  Their renewed friendship begins slowly and then picks up again almost where they left off.  In this case though, they find themselves falling in love.  Jane once again gets in touch with feelings, emotions, and a sense of fun and adventure that she thought she had lost.  Long story short, Michael is forced to leave her once again and Jane finds that she cannot go through with her scheduled wedding and leaves her groom at the altar, literally.  Michael doesn't leave and the two live happily ever after.  I couldn't bring myself to give the film five stars even though I liked it immensely.  It is a little cheesy, but an excellent movie for a hopeless romantic like me.  It is one of those movies that makes me feel good when I watch it and for that reason I recommend it.",4,This Movie Stands on Its Own.,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,1811,"['movie', 'different', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'almost', 'way', 'however', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'make', 'one', 'movie', 'book', 'separate', 'entities', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'better', 'judge', 'movie', 'very', 'serious', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'touch', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'fantasies', 'age', 'five', 'tenth', 'birthday', 'Jane', 'had', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'named', 'Michael', 'did', 'everything', 'together', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'even', 'finish', 'one', 'sentences', 'make', 'up', 'stories', 'people', 'observe', 'are', 'sense', 'word', 'best', 'friends', 'Jane', 'tenth', 'birthday', 'Tiffany', 'Michael', 'must', 'leave', 'go', 'be', 'child', 'Jump', '20', 'years', 'future', 'Jane', 'grown-up', 'beautiful', 'professional', 'woman', 'Manhattan', 'theater', 'manager', 'mother', 'theater', 'very', 'serious', 'focused', 'career', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'Michael', 'grown-up', 'attempts', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'when', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'renewed', 'friendship', 'slowly', 'then', 'up', 'again', 'almost', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'case', 'find', 'falling', 'love', 'Jane', 'once', 'again', 'touch', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'sense', 'fun', 'adventure', 'thought', 'had', 'lost', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'Michael', 'forced', 'leave', 'once', 'again', 'Jane', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'scheduled', 'wedding', 'groom', 'altar', 'literally', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'leave', 'two', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'even', 'liked', 'immensely', 'little', 'cheesy', 'excellent', 'movie', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'one', 'movies', 'feel', 'good', 'when', 'watch', 'reason', 'recommend']",Sundays at Tiffany's

1457383,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005F3XV4Y,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","As if Audrey Hepburn didn't make Tiffany's special enough, here comes this enchanting Lifetime movie to do its part. Peep the premise: In New York City, each Sunday, little Jane Claremont and her self-involved mom (Stockard Channing) follow a tradition of visiting Tiffany's. It's at Tiffany's, back when she was five and three quarters years old, that the lonely Jane first met her imaginary friend, a boy named Michael, and they've been tight ever since. Except that on her tenth birthday, when the clock struck 5:15pm - which is the moment she was born - Michael went away. And Jane Claremont had to grow up.Twenty years later, life could not better be for Jane Claremont (Alyssa Milano). She has a successful career managing her mom's often sold out theater. She lives in a spacious New York apartment. She's engaged to Hugh, a handsome, much-in-demand actor (Ivan Sergei). Her nuptials less than thirty days away, the only thing she's stressing about are those nagging final wedding planner decisions (she's yet to pick out the flowers, the cake, the wedding dress...). These are good problems to have.Into Jane's perfect life steps her childhood imaginary friend, Michael, now all grown up and making chaos of serenity. Michael (Eric Winter), for his part, is mystified by the fact that he's human now, that he's not a kid anymore and that everyone can see him. Rumors of his state has spread like wildfire in the guardian angel community. A fellow imaginary friend reminds Michael: ""We come when they need us and we leave on their birthdays."" Michael can only assume that Jane desperately needs him for something, although Jane at first warily eyes him, like he's a stalker. But Michael's right. Jane needs him, needs her best friend. She just doesn't know it yet.I didn't expect to find SUNDAYS AT TIFFANY'S as enthralling as I did. But I easily got caught up. Very loosely based on a book by James Patterson and Gabrielle Charbonnet (apparently, only the basic premise and the two leads' names survived the adaptation), this is an irresistible romantic Christmas movie, and I'm a bit put out that I saw it only after the holidays. First off, the two kids actors - Emily Alyn Lind and Gage Munroe - who play the younger Jane and Michael have terrific chemistry. They effortlessly establish the closeness between Jane and Michael. When Michael has to leave, Emily Alyn Lind' tearful reaction is heartbreaking. The kids set a fairly high standard for Milano and Winter to match.Match it they did. Milano and Winter are naturally great together. Alyssa Milano tones down the sexy somewhat, and she's more effective for it, playing a normal, level-headed career girl. Don't let me mislead you, though, she is still flat out gorgeous. And, throughout the film, she also gets to demonstrate her comic chops. Eric Winter, meanwhile, is just disarming. He brings a charm and exuberance to his role, and it's fun watching his character experience what it's like to be human, to taste food for the first time, or even get slapped. My girl went all ""Awww, so cute!"" when he busted out the MC Hammer moves in that bar. SUNDAYS AT TIFFANY'S won't surprise you much and, no, it doesn't really explore the mythos of Michael's guardian angel role in depth, focusing more on the romantic aspects of the story. At a certain point, if you hadn't yet sussed out which way the wind was blowing, you had to have had a clue, finally, when Jane arrived home and Michael's painted her apartment and fixed her shower and cooked for her. He confesses: ""One of my assignments was Martha Stewart's daughter."" This show of kindness just may be enough for a girl who's about to get married to reassess her life. Meanwhile, Ivan Sergei perseveres with his third wheel role, and it's a bit of a shame since his character of ""Hugh the vain actor"" isn't so bad a fella. I liked him more than Stockard Channing's Vivian (Jane's mom) who could teach Hugh a thing or two about being self-centered.",5,"""I'm being followed by a figment of my imagination.""",1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,3967,"['Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Tiffany', 'special', 'enough', 'here', 'enchanting', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'do', 'part', 'Peep', 'premise', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Sunday', 'little', 'Jane', 'Claremont', 'self-involved', 'mom', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'follow', 'tradition', 'visiting', 'Tiffany', 'Tiffany', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'five', 'three', 'quarters', 'years', 'old', 'lonely', 'Jane', 'first', 'met', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'boy', 'named', 'Michael', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tight', 'ever', 'tenth', 'birthday', 'when', 'clock', 'struck', '5:15pm', 'moment', 'was', 'born', 'Michael', 'went', 'away', 'Jane', 'Claremont', 'had', 'grow', 'up.Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'life', 'could', 'not', 'better', 'be', 'Jane', 'Claremont', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'successful', 'career', 'managing', 'mom', 'often', 'sold', 'out', 'theater', 'spacious', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'engaged', 'Hugh', 'handsome', 'much-in-demand', 'actor', 'Ivan', 'Sergei', 'nuptials', 'less', 'thirty', 'days', 'away', 'only', 'thing', 'stressing', 'about', 'are', 'nagging', 'final', 'wedding', 'planner', 'decisions', 'yet', 'pick', 'out', 'flowers', 'cake', 'wedding', 'dress', 'are', 'good', 'problems', 'have.Into', 'Jane', 'perfect', 'life', 'steps', 'childhood', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Michael', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'making', 'chaos', 'serenity', 'Michael', 'Eric', 'Winter', 'part', 'mystified', 'fact', 'human', 'now', 'not', 'kid', 'anymore', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'Rumors', 'state', 'spread', 'wildfire', 'guardian', 'angel', 'community', 'fellow', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Michael', 'come', 'when', 'need', 'leave', 'birthdays', 'Michael', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'Jane', 'desperately', 'something', 'Jane', 'first', 'warily', 'stalker', 'Michael', 'right', 'Jane', 'best', 'friend', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'SUNDAYS', 'AT', 'TIFFANY', 'as', 'enthralling', 'did', 'easily', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'Very', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', 'James', 'Patterson', 'Gabrielle', 'Charbonnet', 'apparently', 'only', 'basic', 'premise', 'two', 'leads', 'names', 'survived', 'adaptation', 'irresistible', 'romantic', 'Christmas', 'movie', ""'m"", 'bit', 'put', 'out', 'saw', 'only', 'holidays', 'First', 'two', 'kids', 'actors', 'Emily', 'Alyn', 'Lind', 'Gage', 'Munroe', 'who', 'play', 'younger', 'Jane', 'Michael', 'have', 'terrific', 'chemistry', 'effortlessly', 'establish', 'closeness', 'Jane', 'Michael', 'When', 'Michael', 'leave', 'Emily', 'Alyn', 'Lind', 'tearful', 'reaction', 'heartbreaking', 'kids', 'set', 'fairly', 'high', 'standard', 'Milano', 'Winter', 'match.Match', 'did', 'Milano', 'Winter', 'are', 'naturally', 'great', 'together', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'tones', 'down', 'sexy', 'somewhat', 'more', 'effective', 'playing', 'normal', 'level-headed', 'career', 'girl', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'mislead', 'though', 'still', 'flat', 'out', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'also', 'demonstrate', 'comic', 'chops', 'Eric', 'Winter', 'meanwhile', 'just', 'disarming', 'charm', 'exuberance', 'role', 'fun', 'watching', 'character', 'experience', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'taste', 'food', 'first', 'time', 'even', 'get', 'slapped', 'My', 'girl', 'went', 'Awww', 'cute', 'when', 'busted', 'out', 'MC', 'Hammer', 'bar', 'SUNDAYS', 'AT', 'TIFFANY', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'much', ""n't"", 'really', 'explore', 'mythos', 'Michael', 'guardian', 'angel', 'role', 'depth', 'focusing', 'more', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'story', 'certain', 'point', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'sussed', 'out', 'way', 'wind', 'was', 'blowing', 'had', 'have', 'had', 'clue', 'finally', 'when', 'Jane', 'arrived', 'home', 'Michael', 'painted', 'apartment', 'fixed', 'shower', 'cooked', 'One', 'assignments', 'was', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'daughter', 'show', 'kindness', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'girl', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'reassess', 'life', 'Meanwhile', 'Ivan', 'Sergei', 'third', 'wheel', 'role', 'bit', 'shame', 'character', 'Hugh', 'vain', 'actor', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'fella', 'liked', 'more', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Vivian', 'Jane', 'mom', 'who', 'could', 'teach', 'Hugh', 'thing', 'two', 'being', 'self-centered']",Sundays at Tiffany's

1457390,AOKIJQEO2DDNM,B005F3XV4Y,Little ol me,"[3, 4]","Watched this movie last night.  Previously read the book.  Comparing the two I was afraid that the movie wouldnt do the book justice and basically the book *was* better, but the story overall lacked in so many ways.  *Spoiler Warning* The movie didnt spend as much time as the book did on the yearly Breakfast at Tiffany's or it being her birthday, so the meaning was lost unless you were familiar with the book.  This was the same for the jewelry store scenes also.  So the viewer might wonder why they keep mentioning repeated visits to these places when you only see a few visits.  I was also afraid that the age choices they chose for the main characters would be too young, but Alyssa Milano pulls it off very well.  Her mother (Stockard Channing) didnt age throughout the movie.  She was old when the movie starts out years prior, and she appears just as old 20 years later. Although, she did replicate the mother in the book quite well on screen.  There was one moment during a wedding scene where the mother says to the approaching florist ""no more carnations, we need yellow roses!"".  The florist is HOLDING YELLOW ROSES! so did Stockard get her line wrong or did the prop crew hand her the wrong flowers?  I am thinking it was the prop crew since the official wedding flowers are yellow roses. The movie/book was frustrating as Michael returns 20 years later, and just when Jane falls in love with him, he tells her he must leave her AGAIN. Having her heart ripped out at ten years old was bad enough, but to have it ripped out again just didnt make any sense.  So why did he return?  They never say.*FAMILY ALERT* This movie, its cover, and its story seem fine enough for family viewing, but be forewarned there is a lovemaking scene that leaves nothing to the imagination.  While they are fairly covered with a white bed sheet, Janes bare legs are out of the sheets and bent while Michael is naked down to his lower waist and thrusting upon her.  The scene seems to go on forever and just sits on this image for too long.  We get the idea, and its a little much.  This is also taking place while Jane is engaged and to be married to another man in only a few more days.Eric Winter who plays Michael is very good, as is her friend Kristen Booth.  I didnt care for Ivan Sergei playing Hugh.

1457393,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B005F3XV4Y,mk,"[0, 0]","Alyssa Milano returns with another delightful, and of course, predictable, romantic comedy(RC)- predictable yes, but with a interesting premise.Summary: we first see the heroine as a lonely child at Tiffany's with her solid but dry mother(Stockard Channing).  The little girl has a boy friend with her.  We find out he's imaginary; her best and probably only friend, and now because she's turning 10, he's leaving her.  She's heartbroken-> cut to 20 years later, now grown up, engaged to handsome, successful actor(Ivan Sergei), her imaginary friend(Eric WInter) returns to her, also grown up. Conflict and fun ensues.This is a by the book RC:  1. Pretty woman engaged to the wrong person.  Watch her fiance.  Every conversation, one way or another, turns back to him and his life.  It's hilarious.  2. Her real love pops into her life magically; also, there's a small back story about imaginary friends, and the work they do, etc., and 3. There's romantic, heartfelt turmoil- she becomes totally confused about what to do, who to be with, or what's really important in life.Every RC has a premise, and this one's good, far-fetched more than usual, but enjoyable.  Is the imaginary friend real, will he stay, will love blossom, or will she stay in the 'real' world and do the right thing as per her mother?The film is well shot and mostly well scripted.  There are a few holes(I know it's fantasy!) especially at the end and how quickly they wrap it up, and there are a couple of really sappy parts- almost groaning, not quite, but over all it's funny and sweet.Not exactly family friendly, they show a quick bedroom scene- could have easily left it out; however, there's no nudity, violence, or significant language.In a way, Eric Winter's character remains me of 'Elf'.  Innocent, naive, caring to a fault, stuck in New York City during Christmas season.  Maybe in a hardened, beat-up world and economy with rough and tumble relationships, we all could use more imagination and TLC!Based on the other reviews: 'read the book= hate the movie'.
