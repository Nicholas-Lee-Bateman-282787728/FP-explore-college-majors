Seriously, there is no more intrigue that matches this whole scene. The teacher (Tim Daly) was so mesmerized by this peek-a-boo action of Panettieres' skirt, he forgets he is a responsible teacher, and that there is another student(the chunky girl from ""Spanglish"" [not chunky anymore]) watching him. They are the last two students out of the classroom. He gets caught leaning way over beyond the point of subtlety, and the ""Spanglish"" girl asks Daly, ""is Ally's ass going to be on the test?""(I laughed a little on that line)  Unfortunately there are no more scenes like this. There was no passion in the kiss in the truck, so don't expect a ""taboo"" teacher student romance. It would have been nice but, it never happens. The rest is not that interesting. Hayden is kidnapped, so you don't see ""The Good Student"" very much. Get the cheap one if you buy a DVD. The acting is not that bad but, there is not enough tension between the student and the teacher. If it is supposed to be a comedy. it falls flat. I consider this to be a good review not a bad one, its just that I did not get if it was funny, or an attempt at taboo.

Chow,"[16, 23]","Anything with an alluring pose by Hayden Panettiere (is there any other kind of pose she knows?) is worth 90 minutes of your worthless time.`The Good Student' delivers what it promises, a modern day `Lolita' with little Hayden in skimpy outfits.`The Good Student' is a dark comedy making fun of modern society in the tradition of `Welcome To the Dollhouse' featuring dysfunctional families, cops, and small towns, all set to a Danny Elfman style score.Tim Daly (`Superman' animated series) stars as our modern day and likeable Humbert Humbert. He's far too smart and normal to be working as a school teacher in this one horse town. It's implied he is in hiding as he hides hundreds of thousands of dollars in his trailer home floor boards. He also ignores his blonde next door neighbor whom practically throws herself at him on a daily basis for 6 years.Humbert's only form of excitement is drooling over his student Hayden. But how far will he go?Unfortunately 30 minutes in Hayden departs from the film by being kidnapped. (Presumably by the school's janitor.) Now the cops and the whole school are looking a whole lot closer at Humbert's inappropriate behavior around Hayden. Every aspect of his life is on trial.`The Good Student' is a dark comedy short on actual laughs but involving characters we actual like and care about. We are also treated to a healthy dose of fan service via up close shots of Hayden in mini skirts.This is a must see for all die hard (or just hard) Hayden fans.",4,Required Viewing For All Hayden Fans,1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,1491,"['Anything', 'alluring', 'pose', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'there', 'other', 'kind', 'pose', 'worth', '90', 'minutes', 'worthless', 'time.', 'Good', 'Student', 'delivers', 'what', 'modern', 'day', 'Lolita', 'little', 'Hayden', 'skimpy', 'outfits.', 'Good', 'Student', 'dark', 'comedy', 'making', 'fun', 'modern', 'society', 'tradition', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'featuring', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'cops', 'small', 'towns', 'set', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'style', 'score.Tim', 'Daly', 'Superman', 'animated', 'series', 'modern', 'day', 'likeable', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'far', 'too', 'smart', 'normal', 'be', 'working', 'school', 'teacher', 'one', 'horse', 'town', 'implied', 'hiding', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'trailer', 'home', 'floor', 'boards', 'also', 'blonde', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'whom', 'practically', 'daily', 'basis', '6', 'years.Humbert', 'only', 'form', 'excitement', 'drooling', 'student', 'Hayden', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'Unfortunately', '30', 'minutes', 'Hayden', 'departs', 'film', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'Presumably', 'school', 'janitor', 'Now', 'cops', 'whole', 'school', 'are', 'looking', 'whole', 'lot', 'closer', 'Humbert', 'inappropriate', 'behavior', 'Hayden', 'Every', 'aspect', 'life', 'trial.', 'Good', 'Student', 'dark', 'comedy', 'short', 'actual', 'laughs', 'involving', 'characters', 'actual', 'care', 'about', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'healthy', 'dose', 'fan', 'service', 'close', 'shots', 'Hayden', 'mini', 'skirts.This', 'must', 'see', 'die', 'hard', 'just', 'hard', 'Hayden', 'fans']",N/A

First, let me start with the background music. Music plays an important role in a film. The quirky instrumental that continually played throughout the film set a bad tone. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be watching a thriller or a comedy. Turns out I was watching neither. The film lacked any sort of thrills or edge of the seat terror. The drama was at a minimum, and the few comedic moments fall flat. If you're watching this for Hayden, you'll be disappointed. She doesn't have alot of dialogue. If its Tim Daly you want, well, his character is a total bore. Overall, the reveal at the end is a let down.

1212632,A311XX0ZTZGY7H,B001KZVQKC,Styles1333,"[3, 3]","I just rented this movie and when I saw the cover of it featuring Tim Daly and Hayden Panetierre and the word THRILLER on it, I figured it was some sort of horror movie or some big drama movie.  When you watch the beginning of it, it seemed like it would be a pretty good movie.  The movie basically takes place in a small town environment.  Tim Daly, playing a history professor, appears to be very poor and very unpopular, not only to students but also to the faculty members.  Hayden Panetierre plays a high school student, but there's really no interaction between them until Tim Daly's character sees Hayden's character in a cheerleader outfit on tv when she's helping her father advertise for the dealership.  Later Daly's character is checking out Hayden's ass when class is over.  So at this point I thought it was going to be a horror film because the teacher is obsessed with her.  At first it seems to be a sexual obsession, but throughout the movie, however, the viewer never really understands the obsession  Later, Hayden's character gets kidnapped so now it has the feeling that it's going to be a mystery type movie and it leaves the casual viewer the question of ""who kidnapped her?  And why?""  And honestly, the rest of the story just got weird and odd and leaves the viewer uninteresting.  While I do think there was some good character development of Palmer (Hayden's character's father) being a selfish prick that basically used the kidnapping to help with the marketing of his business and later there is some justice for his crimes in the movie, that's about it.  The worst scene in the film was Hayden's ex boyfriend in the movie dresses up like the kidnapper, but when Tim Daly's character finds out who he is and the boyfriend admits he wasn't the kidnapper and gets shot by  Hayden's father, what was the point of that scene?!  The father never even approaches the kidnapper, so why shoot him?  I won't spoil the ending on who was behind the kidnapping, but it really just made me question the sense it makes.  I believe the climax of the movie was for there to be some justice over the father, but it was a very, very odd way to achieve it.  In addition, it doesn't really make sense of the other events in the movie either.the positives:Acting was pretty goodHayden looked really sexyNegatives:The story had a few swerves and then it crashed off the side of the roadThis wasn't a thriller by any meansNot enough HaydenEnding made no sense for those of us used to a common sense ending, or at least if you give the audience a swerve, it's in the right direction.The scene with the boyfriend dressing up in exactly the kidnapper's attire and not being remotely related in any way to the kidnapping was extremely pointless and a waste.Daly's obsession with Hayden's character is never really explained and if it is, then fill me in because I could not see it.There were definitely a ton of good directions they could've taken this movie that would've been better than the course they took.Overall grade:  D+  This wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but this is one I wouldn't watch again.",2,Terrible movie (contains some spoilers/my thoughts),1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,3120,"['just', 'rented', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'cover', 'featuring', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'word', 'THRILLER', 'figured', 'was', 'sort', 'horror', 'movie', 'big', 'drama', 'movie', 'When', 'watch', 'beginning', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'movie', 'basically', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'environment', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'playing', 'history', 'professor', 'be', 'very', 'poor', 'very', 'unpopular', 'not', 'only', 'students', 'also', 'faculty', 'members', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'really', 'interaction', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'character', 'Hayden', 'character', 'cheerleader', 'outfit', 'tv', 'when', 'helping', 'father', 'advertise', 'dealership', 'Later', 'Daly', 'character', 'checking', 'out', 'Hayden', 'ass', 'when', 'class', 'over', 'So', 'point', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'horror', 'film', 'teacher', 'obsessed', 'first', 'be', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'movie', 'however', 'viewer', 'never', 'really', 'obsession', 'Later', 'Hayden', 'character', 'kidnapped', 'so', 'now', 'feeling', 'going', 'be', 'mystery', 'type', 'movie', 'casual', 'viewer', 'question', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'why', 'honestly', 'rest', 'story', 'just', 'got', 'weird', 'odd', 'viewer', 'uninteresting', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'Palmer', 'Hayden', 'character', 'father', 'being', 'selfish', 'prick', 'basically', 'used', 'kidnapping', 'help', 'marketing', 'business', 'later', 'justice', 'crimes', 'movie', 'worst', 'scene', 'film', 'was', 'Hayden', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'movie', 'up', 'kidnapper', 'when', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'character', 'out', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'was', ""n't"", 'kidnapper', 'shot', 'Hayden', 'father', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'scene', 'father', 'never', 'even', 'kidnapper', 'so', 'why', 'shoot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'who', 'was', 'kidnapping', 'really', 'just', 'made', 'question', 'sense', 'believe', 'climax', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'justice', 'father', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'odd', 'way', 'achieve', 'addition', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'other', 'events', 'movie', 'either.the', 'positives', 'Acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'goodHayden', 'looked', 'really', 'sexyNegatives', 'story', 'had', 'few', 'swerves', 'then', 'crashed', 'off', 'side', 'roadThis', 'was', ""n't"", 'thriller', 'meansNot', 'enough', 'HaydenEnding', 'made', 'sense', 'used', 'common', 'sense', 'ending', 'least', 'give', 'audience', 'swerve', 'right', 'direction.The', 'scene', 'boyfriend', 'dressing', 'up', 'exactly', 'kidnapper', 'attire', 'not', 'being', 'remotely', 'related', 'way', 'kidnapping', 'was', 'extremely', 'pointless', 'waste.Daly', 'obsession', 'Hayden', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'then', 'fill', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'it.There', 'were', 'definitely', 'ton', 'good', 'directions', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'course', 'took.Overall', 'grade', 'D+', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again']",N/A
