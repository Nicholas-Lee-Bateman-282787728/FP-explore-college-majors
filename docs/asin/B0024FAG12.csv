1249828,A2S244KFX0745K,B0024FAG12,Alan Edward Creager,"[6, 6]","Do mind the spoilers.""The Strange One"" came out in 1957, attracting precious little attention then- do you know anyone who saw it that year?- or now. Every now and then, a perfectly good movie comes out and just about nobody watches it. This is an ideal example of that kind of movie.Set at the fictional Southern Military College, ""The Strange One"" sees us enter into the time of day when platoon sergeant Jocko DeParis is at his most powerful- after taps. He appears in the room of two freshmen, and switches between hazing them and playing games with their heads. Inviting a fellow senior into the room- knowing full well he gets mean when he's drunk- Jocko ensures this senior loses badly at a game of cards while drinking, making noise and becoming irritable. The son of a prominent staff member arrives to investigate the disturbance, and Jocko immediately shuts off the lights and directs his drunk classmate to attack the other cadet. The next day, the son of Major Avery is found on the quadrangle, beaten up and apparently drunk. He is soon expelled. It is soon revealed that Avery was involved in a situation that caused DeParis to be fired as a platoon commander the previous year.DeParis is a study in what one individual can do when he has enough power in his hands and the will to use all of it. He lies, manipulates, bullies and degrades, all that and so much more. Simply because he can. He's not against anyone in particular- he's against everybody. That someone could be so harsh, so dismissive of everyone around him- it's not as impossible as you might think. Look around you, through enough history books- human cruelty can be quite bottomless. But, while Jocko lives quite successfully on Himmler's concept of being feared rather than loved, being hated starts to catch up to him. It starts with a freshman standing up to him. It continues with some other freshmen, plus Jocko's roommate, joining him. Pretty soon the regimental commander and over a dozen other cadets are involved. They corner Jocko at a cafe in town, with the regimental commander holding up a piece of paper, listing Jocko's numerous sins, evidence against him, and a line for his signed confession. The reason for all this, even though Jocko's roommate and the two freshmen will be kicked out as well? They've all had enough. Jocko's been walking all over them for years and they've just had enough.A hallmark of people like Jocko DeParis, so far as I have seen, is that beneath their arrogant manner, their professed superiority, is a coward, never quite sure he's as good as he says. When cornered alone- and they have a distinct tendency to run short on friends at such times- they do not stand fast. They fold. That's what we see Jocko do here. He's thrown onto a train and shipped out of town, and as soon as he realizes he's not to be run over by the train, Jocko becomes defiant again, yelling from the rearmost car that he'll be back.""The Strange One"" is filmed in black and white, runs one hour and forty minutes, and was filmed in Florida. It can be distinguished, if one recognizes enough details, that the Southern Military College is based off The Citadel in South Carolina. This movie hardly portrays life at such a college in a positive light, but from what I know of what military schools and colleges were like in the fifties, it's entirely possible a Jocko DeParis could've existed. One shouldn't lose respect for such schools because of this, though. It's been a while since 1957, and even then we see Jocko being run out of the school. The acting in ""The Strange One"" is excellent, as is the soundtrack that Keynon Hopkins devised for it. Overall, the movie is consistently interesting from start to finish, and Jack Garfein knew what he was doing as the director. But one thought lingered for me, long after the credits finished- ""The Strange One"" told us many times that Jocko's roommate and the two freshmen would be kicked out for cooperating with Jocko, but it forgot to tell us why. The 1983 film adaptation of ""The Lords of Discipline"" sees G.D. Spradlin as General Bentley Durrell, sternly informing the corps- ""A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do. There are no second chances here.""That's the one line loose end this film left somewhere out there in the cosmos. It forgot to tell us the one law that rules any good military school- the honor code. But compared to the catastrophic list of mistakes that some films, with far greater publicity and a much bigger budget, have managed to make, the one unsolved mystery this film needlessly leaves us with is quiet easy to overlook. This is a much better film, with much better acting, than many in theaters today.",5,One of the best movies nobody ever saw.,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,4708,"['Do', 'mind', 'spoilers', 'Strange', 'One', 'came', 'out', '1957', 'attracting', 'precious', 'little', 'attention', 'then-', 'do', 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'year', 'now', 'now', 'then', 'perfectly', 'good', 'movie', 'out', 'just', 'nobody', 'watches', 'ideal', 'example', 'kind', 'movie.Set', 'fictional', 'Southern', 'Military', 'College', 'Strange', 'One', 'enter', 'time', 'day', 'when', 'platoon', 'sergeant', 'Jocko', 'DeParis', 'most', 'powerful-', 'taps', 'room', 'two', 'freshmen', 'switches', 'hazing', 'playing', 'games', 'heads', 'Inviting', 'fellow', 'senior', 'room-', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'mean', 'when', 'drunk-', 'Jocko', 'senior', 'badly', 'game', 'cards', 'drinking', 'making', 'noise', 'becoming', 'irritable', 'son', 'prominent', 'staff', 'member', 'investigate', 'disturbance', 'Jocko', 'immediately', 'lights', 'drunk', 'classmate', 'attack', 'other', 'cadet', 'next', 'day', 'son', 'Major', 'Avery', 'found', 'quadrangle', 'beaten', 'up', 'apparently', 'drunk', 'soon', 'expelled', 'soon', 'revealed', 'Avery', 'was', 'involved', 'situation', 'caused', 'DeParis', 'be', 'fired', 'platoon', 'commander', 'previous', 'year.DeParis', 'study', 'what', 'one', 'individual', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'enough', 'power', 'hands', 'will', 'use', 'manipulates', 'bullies', 'degrades', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Simply', 'can', 'not', 'anyone', 'particular-', 'everybody', 'someone', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'harsh', 'so', 'dismissive', 'everyone', 'him-', 'not', 'as', 'impossible', 'might', 'think', 'Look', 'enough', 'history', 'books-', 'human', 'cruelty', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'bottomless', 'Jocko', 'quite', 'successfully', 'Himmler', 'concept', 'being', 'feared', 'rather', 'loved', 'being', 'hated', 'starts', 'catch', 'up', 'freshman', 'standing', 'up', 'other', 'freshmen', 'Jocko', 'roommate', 'joining', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'regimental', 'commander', 'dozen', 'other', 'cadets', 'are', 'involved', 'corner', 'Jocko', 'cafe', 'town', 'regimental', 'commander', 'holding', 'up', 'piece', 'paper', 'listing', 'Jocko', 'numerous', 'sins', 'evidence', 'line', 'signed', 'confession', 'reason', 'even', 'Jocko', 'roommate', 'two', 'freshmen', 'will', 'be', 'kicked', 'out', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'Jocko', 'been', 'walking', 'years', ""'ve"", 'just', 'had', 'enough.A', 'hallmark', 'people', 'Jocko', 'DeParis', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'seen', 'beneath', 'arrogant', 'manner', 'professed', 'superiority', 'coward', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'as', 'good', 'When', 'cornered', 'alone-', 'have', 'distinct', 'tendency', 'run', 'short', 'friends', 'such', 'times-', 'do', 'not', 'stand', 'fast', 'fold', 'what', 'see', 'Jocko', 'do', 'here', 'thrown', 'train', 'shipped', 'town', 'as', 'soon', 'not', 'be', 'run', 'train', 'Jocko', 'defiant', 'again', 'yelling', 'rearmost', 'car', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'Strange', 'One', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'one', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'was', 'filmed', 'Florida', 'can', 'be', 'distinguished', 'one', 'enough', 'details', 'Southern', 'Military', 'College', 'based', 'off', 'Citadel', 'South', 'Carolina', 'movie', 'hardly', 'life', 'college', 'positive', 'light', 'what', 'know', 'what', 'military', 'schools', 'colleges', 'were', 'fifties', 'entirely', 'possible', 'Jocko', 'DeParis', 'could', ""'ve"", 'existed', 'One', 'should', ""n't"", 'lose', 'respect', 'such', 'schools', 'though', 'been', 'while', '1957', 'even', 'then', 'see', 'Jocko', 'being', 'run', 'school', 'acting', 'Strange', 'One', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'Keynon', 'Hopkins', 'devised', 'Overall', 'movie', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'start', 'finish', 'Jack', 'Garfein', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'director', 'one', 'thought', 'lingered', 'long', 'credits', 'finished-', 'Strange', 'One', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'Jocko', 'roommate', 'two', 'freshmen', 'would', 'be', 'kicked', 'out', 'cooperating', 'Jocko', 'forgot', 'tell', 'why', '1983', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Lords', 'Discipline', 'G.D.', 'Spradlin', 'General', 'Bentley', 'Durrell', 'sternly', 'informing', 'corps-', 'A', 'cadet', 'will', 'not', 'lie', 'cheat', 'steal', 'tolerate', 'who', 'do', 'are', 'second', 'chances', 'here', 'one', 'line', 'loose', 'end', 'film', 'left', 'somewhere', 'there', 'cosmos', 'forgot', 'tell', 'one', 'law', 'rules', 'good', 'military', 'school-', 'honor', 'code', 'compared', 'catastrophic', 'list', 'mistakes', 'films', 'far', 'greater', 'publicity', 'much', 'bigger', 'budget', 'have', 'managed', 'make', 'one', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'film', 'needlessly', 'quiet', 'easy', 'overlook', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'acting', 'many', 'theaters', 'today']",N/A

He tackles his somewhat sado-masochistic character with a subdued urgency and really is the driving force of the storyline.  His character weaves in and out of a major theme of the movie--that of power and submission--those who use it and those who abuse it.  Adapted from the stage play of the same name, this film version retains its theatrical look with its claustrophobic interior sets and close character cropping.  The master and servant interplay between the principle characters drives the film's dialogue driven core, and there is a gay subtext running throughout.  If re-made for today's more accepting audiences, this aspect would most certainly be more prominently explored.  Gazzara talks about the film in the video's extra features but sadly never broaches the subject of the movie's homoerotic undertones.

Ben Gazzara is incredible, has total command and plays Jocko de Paris perfectly, no other actor could have done this. George Pappard, in his debut, is fantastic; Pat Hingle and Mark Richman are excellent as well as is the entire supporting cast. What strikes me the most is Gazzara's complete mastery of not only his own part but the whole film as well. He portrays Jocko de Paris, a consummate bully in a Southern military college and as Peppard comments, flourished in this atmosphere ""like a toadstool in a swamp."" The homosexual overtones caused a bit of trouble for this film which is a shame, but thank God due to its overall excellence, it survived and after being a play on Broadway, achieved immortality on film and now DVD.It is a fascinating and very unusual glimpse into the lives of men in a Southern military college in the 1950s, focusing on one incident that de Paris planned and carried out and the ramifications it caused for the lives of all these men.Gazzara discusses the film and his role as a bonus, and mentions how James Dean tried to steal the role, which would have been a disaster and doomed this film into permanent obscurity. Not to take anything away from Dean, but this role requires a subtlety, finesse and intelligence way beyond Dean's capabilities.Gazzara owns this part.",5,"Extraordinary film, very underrated",1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,1387,"['first', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'stunned', 'how', 'unusual', 'brilliant', 'was', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'incredible', 'total', 'command', 'plays', 'Jocko', 'Paris', 'perfectly', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'George', 'Pappard', 'debut', 'fantastic', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'Mark', 'Richman', 'are', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'What', 'most', 'Gazzara', 'complete', 'mastery', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'part', 'whole', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Jocko', 'de', 'Paris', 'consummate', 'bully', 'Southern', 'military', 'college', 'Peppard', 'comments', 'flourished', 'atmosphere', 'toadstool', 'swamp', 'homosexual', 'overtones', 'caused', 'bit', 'trouble', 'film', 'shame', 'thank', 'God', 'due', 'overall', 'excellence', 'survived', 'being', 'play', 'Broadway', 'achieved', 'immortality', 'film', 'now', 'DVD.It', 'fascinating', 'very', 'unusual', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'men', 'Southern', 'military', 'college', '1950s', 'focusing', 'one', 'incident', 'Paris', 'planned', 'carried', 'ramifications', 'caused', 'lives', 'men.Gazzara', 'film', 'role', 'bonus', 'mentions', 'how', 'James', 'Dean', 'tried', 'steal', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disaster', 'doomed', 'film', 'permanent', 'obscurity', 'Not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'Dean', 'role', 'subtlety', 'finesse', 'intelligence', 'way', 'Dean', 'capabilities.Gazzara', 'part']",N/A

One such movie is The Strange One, a powerful drama set at a Southern military academy. The film marked the screen debut of Ben Gazzara (who had played his role onstage) and George Peppard, and it is easily one of Gazzara's best movies.Gazzara plays Jocko DeParis, a sadistic bully who manipulates his fellow cadets and even some of the teachers (who are regular military officers) into doing his bidding. He manages to get a fellow cadet, son of the commander, kicked out after forcing liquor down his throat, but the stunt backfires horribly when the disgraced cadet kills himself. Now, de Paris has to use all the wiles and threats he can to try to ensure that his role in the incident doesn't come out, while the others involved wrestle with their consciences as to what to do.The film is a fascinating exploration of power, authority, the extent of duty and honor, and psychological warfare. DeParis is a master at these sort of games, but slowly his world and authority begin to crumble around him. Gazzara plays the role perfectly, as his smug demeanor and sinister charm come through in scene after scene. The film's also a veritable who's who of rising character actors who would become prominent in the next decade, including a slim Pat Hingle, Mark Richman, Clifton James, and James Olson.The main distinction of the film today is a rather sad one, however. The film has some definite homosexual overtones, with the relationships among some of the cadets hinted at and one cadet in particular having a fairy obvious crush on de Paris. However, this material had to be toned down and some scenes cut during its theatrical release, which undoubtedly contributed to the film's commercial failure. Fortunately, it's been restored so the full impact of the original play is restored.The film does have one interesting extra, a 10-minute interview with Ben Gazzara in which he talks about the making of the movie and why it failed initially. He gives a fascinating behind-the-scene look at the making of the film. On a personal note, I came from Orlando, FL, and the movie was filmed at Rollins College in nearby Winter Park.
