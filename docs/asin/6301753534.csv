I love being able to find all these old classics on DVD now because it sure brings back a lot of memories.  I grew up watching these Sing Alongs over and over, so much that the VHS tapes were ruined (lol).  So for all you Disney and Disneyland fans this is a must have.I wish people would understand that this Sing Along is called ""Disneyland Fun""... so for the entire DVD to be about Disneyland is more than expected... plus if you had seen this when you were younger than it should be no surprise to you.  As well as Grim Grinning Ghosts and how some feel it should have been cut out of the DVD... the Haunted Mansion is a huge part of Disneyland, so if Disney would have cut that segment out of the DVD... well I would have been outraged. Sure its scary if your like two years old, so then fast forward it if thats the case...Overall, excellent purchase, loved it, still do and always will!",5,Sing Along CLASSIC!,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,998,"['love', 'watched', 'going', 'Disneyland', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'excited', 'go', 'back', 'love', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'old', 'classics', 'DVD', 'now', 'sure', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Sing', 'Alongs', 'over', 'so', 'much', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'were', 'ruined', 'lol', 'So', 'Disney', 'Disneyland', 'fans', 'must', 'have.I', 'wish', 'people', 'would', 'understand', 'Sing', 'Along', 'called', 'Disneyland', 'Fun', 'so', 'entire', 'DVD', 'be', 'Disneyland', 'more', 'expected', 'had', 'seen', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'As', 'well', 'Grim', 'Grinning', 'Ghosts', 'how', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'DVD', 'Haunted', 'Mansion', 'huge', 'part', 'Disneyland', 'so', 'Disney', 'would', 'have', 'cut', 'segment', 'DVD', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'outraged', 'Sure', 'scary', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'then', 'fast', 'forward', 'case', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'purchase', 'loved', 'still', 'do', 'always', 'will']",Sing Along Songs: Disneyland Fun It's A Small World VHS
264034,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,6301753534,a,"[1, 1]","I agree with other reviewers that this is a great DVD, especially for little ones.  I shared it with my infant daughter once or twice a week three months prior to our Disney World vacation.  Even at nine months, when we recently visited, she seemed to recognize the characters and music and while other babies her age cried or hid their faces from the costumed characters, my daughter readily hugged them and shook with excitement.  I give this DVD much of the credit.I am writing this review to alert buyers that, even though it is not mentioned anywhere on the packaging, this DVD edition also offers a terrific half-hour bonus program.  On the Language selection page, one has the option of choosing ""French"" instead of ""English.""  This launches a completely different 30-minute program filmed at Disneyland Paris and even features a couple of different songs.  Of course, the voices and lyrics are in French, but it's a terrific glimpse at the Paris park in the early 1990s and is equally fun for my infant daughter.This ""special feature"" is unique to this one singalong DVD, but I am thrilled to see it included.  It doubles the running time and makes it really worth while as a purchase.  However, it is so well hidden (on the Language menu), that I'll bet that half of the people who own this DVD don't even realize that it's there, waiting to be enjoyed.",5,DVD offers second 30-minute bonus program!,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,1362,"['agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'great', 'DVD', 'especially', 'little', 'ones', 'shared', 'infant', 'daughter', 'once', 'twice', 'week', 'three', 'months', 'prior', 'Disney', 'World', 'vacation', 'Even', 'nine', 'months', 'when', 'recently', 'visited', 'seemed', 'recognize', 'characters', 'music', 'other', 'babies', 'age', 'cried', 'hid', 'costumed', 'characters', 'daughter', 'readily', 'hugged', 'shook', 'excitement', 'give', 'DVD', 'much', 'credit.I', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'alert', 'buyers', 'even', 'not', 'mentioned', 'anywhere', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'edition', 'also', 'terrific', 'half-hour', 'bonus', 'program', 'Language', 'selection', 'page', 'one', 'option', 'choosing', 'French', 'instead', 'English', 'completely', 'different', '30-minute', 'program', 'filmed', 'Disneyland', 'Paris', 'even', 'couple', 'different', 'songs', 'course', 'voices', 'lyrics', 'are', 'French', 'terrific', 'glimpse', 'Paris', 'park', 'early', '1990s', 'equally', 'fun', 'infant', 'daughter.This', 'special', 'feature', 'unique', 'one', 'singalong', 'DVD', 'am', 'thrilled', 'see', 'included', 'running', 'time', 'really', 'worth', 'purchase', 'However', 'so', 'well', 'hidden', 'Language', 'menu', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'half', 'people', 'who', 'own', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'there', 'waiting', 'be', 'enjoyed']",Sing Along Songs: Disneyland Fun It's A Small World VHS

I rented this from the library and it seemed promising at first, but she lost interest by the 3rd song and went back to asking for Beach Party.As for me, I was born and raised in Orlando and went to Walt Disney World at LEAST twice a year from 1973-2003. I am a Disney fanatic and I love the theme parks. And a lot of adults wrote positive reviews here about this video. So I figured there was no way I wouldn't enjoy this, but I have to say I really didn't! It was... hmmm... well, tacky. It didn't bring back 'fond memories' of my trips; instead it seemed like a bad late night infomercial for some little rinky-dink attraction. This might partly be because it's for Disneyland and not the Magic Kingdom, but they aren't THAT different. It seemed like its creators were so determined to make it seem like ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" that everything was WAY overdone, and everyone including the 'guests' were overacting to the EXTREME for the video. It was clearly made in the late 80s or early 90s so the people looked goofier than Goofy. It would be great if Disney would do an updated, modern version of this and make it classier.Also - be aware there is a Haunted Mansion scene that isn't appropriate for kids under 5.",2,I'm a huge Disney World fan and didn't like this & neither did my toddler,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,1313,"['toddler', 'other', 'three', 'WDW', 'sing-along', 'videos', 'Campout', 'Beach', 'Party', 'Flik', 'rented', 'library', 'seemed', 'promising', 'first', 'lost', 'interest', '3rd', 'song', 'went', 'back', 'asking', 'Beach', 'Party.As', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Orlando', 'went', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'World', 'LEAST', 'twice', 'year', '1973-2003', 'am', 'Disney', 'fanatic', 'love', 'theme', 'parks', 'lot', 'adults', 'wrote', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'video', 'So', 'figured', 'was', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'hmmm', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', ""'fond"", 'memories', 'trips', 'instead', 'seemed', 'bad', 'late', 'night', 'infomercial', 'little', 'rinky-dink', 'attraction', 'might', 'partly', 'be', 'Disneyland', 'not', 'Magic', 'Kingdom', 'are', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'different', 'seemed', 'creators', 'were', 'so', 'determined', 'make', 'seem', 'Happiest', 'Place', 'Earth', 'everything', 'was', 'WAY', 'overdone', 'everyone', 'including', ""'guests"", 'were', 'overacting', 'EXTREME', 'video', 'was', 'clearly', 'made', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'people', 'looked', 'goofier', 'Goofy', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Disney', 'would', 'do', 'updated', 'modern', 'version', 'make', 'classier.Also', 'be', 'aware', 'Haunted', 'Mansion', 'scene', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'kids', '5']",Sing Along Songs: Disneyland Fun It's A Small World VHS

My wife & I bought a used VHS copy of it, and from the moment we first put it on for him, he was enthralled and his eyes rarely move away from the screen whenever it's playing. We were surprised to find that it was available on DVD, so we bought it for our son's birthday recently, because the 17-year old tape was quickly wearing out!""Disneyland Fun"" was originally part of a 14 volume VHS video series released in the late 1980's; this particular video was filmed on location at Disneyland in 1990, and follows a singular group of children around the park as they participate in the various song sequences alongside many of the classic Disney characters. Even if you didn't know when it was shot, the time period is quite easy to detect with the brightly colored clothes and big hair on display everywhere, as well as the appearance of the then-new character Roger Rabbit, hot on the heels of his popularity from the 1988 film.But as dated as the proceedings may be, there is a great deal of fun to be had, and the songs are timeless & downright infectious; they'll stick in your head like glue and you'll find yourself singing along them, even when you're not watching it!  My son's favorites are ""I'm Walking Right Down The Middle Of Main Street U.S.A."", and the all-time classics ""It's A Small World"" and ""When You Wish Upon A Star"", complete with an awesome, show-stopping fireworks display.I'd recommend this video highly to anyone with children, but also as a way of appealing to the child in all of us; great fun!",5,Fun From Beginning To End!,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,1569,"['2-year', 'old', 'son', 'absolutely', 'LOVES', 'video', 'My', 'wife', 'bought', 'used', 'VHS', 'copy', 'moment', 'first', 'put', 'was', 'enthralled', 'eyes', 'rarely', 'move', 'away', 'screen', 'whenever', 'playing', 'were', 'surprised', 'find', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'bought', 'son', 'birthday', 'recently', '17-year', 'old', 'tape', 'was', 'quickly', 'wearing', 'out', 'Disneyland', 'Fun', 'was', 'originally', 'part', '14', 'volume', 'VHS', 'video', 'series', 'released', 'late', '1980', 'particular', 'video', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Disneyland', '1990', 'singular', 'group', 'children', 'park', 'participate', 'various', 'song', 'sequences', 'alongside', 'many', 'classic', 'Disney', 'characters', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'was', 'shot', 'time', 'period', 'quite', 'easy', 'detect', 'brightly', 'colored', 'clothes', 'big', 'hair', 'display', 'everywhere', 'as', 'well', 'appearance', 'then-new', 'character', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'hot', 'heels', 'popularity', '1988', 'film.But', 'as', 'dated', 'proceedings', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'songs', 'are', 'timeless', 'downright', 'infectious', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'head', 'glue', ""'ll"", 'find', 'singing', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'watching', 'My', 'son', 'favorites', 'are', ""'m"", 'Walking', 'Right', 'Down', 'Middle', 'Main', 'Street', 'U.S.A.', 'all-time', 'classics', 'A', 'Small', 'World', 'When', 'Wish', 'A', 'Star', 'complete', 'awesome', 'show-stopping', 'fireworks', 'display.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'video', 'highly', 'anyone', 'children', 'also', 'way', 'appealing', 'child', 'great', 'fun']",Sing Along Songs: Disneyland Fun It's A Small World VHS

Now the Sing Along tapes featuring classic Disney films are truly wonderful, but the ""Disneyland Fun"" Sing Along Songs are the best ever!  When I can't be in Disneyland or if I am planning to go soon, I pop in my tape to get ready for the big event.  The film is pretty short (only 29 min.) but features all your favorite characters, rides and attractions at the Anaheim Disneyland Resort.  There is a good dose of Main Street USA activity with parades, Pooh and his friends get rumbly in the tumbly at the Riverbell Terrace restaurant, the Grim Grinning Ghosts come out to socialize in and right outside of the Haunted Mansion and so much more!  My true favorite is ""Zip a Dee Do Da,"" since Roger Rabbit is in there going on a bunch of the rides (some of which are now retired and long gone).  So if you are a nostalgic Disney fan, then this great little film is for you.  Regardless of your age (I am currently 25 & still love it!), you are bound to have fun with it and now that it's coming to dvd, it will be better than ever.

While this one focuses more on the characters, with the kids/child actors in the background, the WDW ones are the opposite, and the end result is a bunch of kids hammin' it up for the camera. In fact, on this Disneyland Fun one, there are several numbers where it's just the characters, and no kids at all!

Sadly, Disneyland Fun was not one of those fourteen, and it was only in recent years that I found that it and nineteen others existed. So what was I to do? Were the twenty I've never known any good as the fourteen I grew up with, or was the reason that they were not released was that they were so bad. I decided to take a gamble by buying this.I chose this one to begin with the missing twenty because I have been to Disneyland USA once before when i was fifteen, and thus far it was the happiest day of my life, and ever since I've always wanted to go back. I've wanted to relive those good memories.I got more than I bargained for. Starting with the traditional beginning of the Sing Along Songs video, we had the animation with Professor Owl and his students, and then Tinker Bell comes along and changes the scenery to a live action day at Disneyland where the hosting is then taken up by Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Minnie, Daisy, Chip 'n Dale, and Roger Rabbit. What follows is the presentation of classic songs such as Following the Leader, It's A Small World and Grim Grinning Ghosts set against footage of children and families spending a joyful day at Disneyland alongside the Disney characters.Disneyland Fun thus has provided me with three things, the first being reliving the happy memories of my one day there at Disneyland. The second is that it has helped me make up my mind into getting the rest of the missing twenty, and I will. And the third and most important thing of all, it has deepened my wish and desire to return there for Fun, Magic, and More.",5,I Want To Go There Again!!!,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,1719,"['Here', 'where', 'live', 'when', 'Disney', 'released', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Song', 'collections', 'only', 'realeased', '14', '34', 'volumes', 'parents', 'Sadly', 'Disneyland', 'Fun', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'fourteen', 'was', 'only', 'recent', 'years', 'found', 'nineteen', 'others', 'existed', 'what', 'was', 'do', 'Were', 'twenty', ""'ve"", 'never', 'known', 'good', 'fourteen', 'grew', 'up', 'was', 'reason', 'were', 'not', 'released', 'was', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'decided', 'take', 'gamble', 'buying', 'this.I', 'chose', 'one', 'begin', 'missing', 'twenty', 'have', 'been', 'Disneyland', 'USA', 'once', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'fifteen', 'thus', 'far', 'was', 'happiest', 'day', 'life', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'go', 'back', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'relive', 'good', 'memories.I', 'got', 'more', 'bargained', 'Starting', 'traditional', 'beginning', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'video', 'had', 'animation', 'Professor', 'Owl', 'students', 'then', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'along', 'scenery', 'live', 'action', 'day', 'Disneyland', 'where', 'hosting', 'then', 'taken', 'up', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'Goofy', 'Minnie', 'Daisy', 'Chip', 'n', 'Dale', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'What', 'presentation', 'classic', 'songs', 'such', 'Following', 'Leader', 'A', 'Small', 'World', 'Grim', 'Grinning', 'set', 'footage', 'children', 'families', 'spending', 'joyful', 'day', 'Disneyland', 'Disney', 'characters.Disneyland', 'Fun', 'thus', 'provided', 'three', 'things', 'first', 'being', 'reliving', 'happy', 'memories', 'one', 'day', 'Disneyland', 'second', 'helped', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'getting', 'rest', 'missing', 'twenty', 'will', 'third', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'deepened', 'wish', 'desire', 'return', 'there', 'Fun', 'Magic', 'More']",Sing Along Songs: Disneyland Fun It's A Small World VHS
