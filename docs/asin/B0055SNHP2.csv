1443162,A1FQAQO2VKWRN,B0055SNHP2,Andy,"[3, 3]","The latest Barbie movie, Princess Charm School, features the story of hard-working Blair, who is adopted as a young child into a poor family. After her sister enters her into a contest, she wins a scholarship to Princess Charm School, where it is hoped she will earn the skills to become a Lady Royal.I think there are many positives about this movie.  The animation is I think better than any of the other Barbie movies, and we've seen them all. This movie carries over themes we've seen in other Barbie movies where someone who has acted terribly towards Barbie or other characters experiences a change of heart and is able to become friends with Barbie's character and I think that is great.  Having good character is emphasized as being a desirable trait, and this movie makes I think an invaluable point about confidence: Nobody ""can make you feel inferior without your consent.""I am however, concerned with the continuing trend of dressing Barbie in skirts that are overly short and that I as an adult would not feel comfortable wearing.  To borrow a phrase Barbie used in ""Fairy Secret,"" they're a little too breezy and certainly not an appropriate model for young children.  The characters in the earlier Barbie movies dressed classier, and in some cases acted in a ways I would feel much more comfortable with my child emulating. I also think some of the ""manny and peddy"" and materialistic swooniness that has crept into the last several Barbie movies, and does indeed show up in this one too, is not so desirable.  A movie can be modern and relevant without so much of these things.I am also lukewarm about some of the similarities with the Harry Potter story.  Blair's parents are killed in a car crash when she is 1 and she is left on somebody's doorstep.  She returns later to a castle that has magical elements that is supposed to help her reach her true potential.  I also could see some elements of the Princess Diary movies in here. However, I think that while you can see that these might have been some of the inspiration for the story line, it is not blatant forgery, so I think it still passes as a cute and respectable movie.",4,Princess Charm School Hits and Misses,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,2148,"['latest', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'Princess', 'Charm', 'School', 'story', 'hard-working', 'Blair', 'who', 'adopted', 'young', 'child', 'poor', 'family', 'sister', 'contest', 'scholarship', 'Princess', 'Charm', 'School', 'where', 'hoped', 'will', 'earn', 'skills', 'become', 'Lady', 'Royal.I', 'think', 'are', 'many', 'positives', 'movie', 'animation', 'think', 'better', 'other', 'Barbie', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'themes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'where', 'someone', 'who', 'acted', 'terribly', 'towards', 'Barbie', 'other', 'characters', 'change', 'heart', 'able', 'become', 'friends', 'Barbie', 'character', 'think', 'great', 'Having', 'good', 'character', 'emphasized', 'being', 'desirable', 'trait', 'movie', 'think', 'invaluable', 'point', 'confidence', 'Nobody', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'inferior', 'consent', 'am', 'however', 'concerned', 'continuing', 'trend', 'dressing', 'Barbie', 'skirts', 'are', 'overly', 'short', 'adult', 'would', 'not', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'wearing', 'borrow', 'phrase', 'Barbie', 'used', 'Fairy', 'Secret', ""'re"", 'little', 'too', 'breezy', 'certainly', 'not', 'appropriate', 'model', 'young', 'children', 'characters', 'earlier', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'dressed', 'classier', 'cases', 'acted', 'ways', 'would', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'comfortable', 'child', 'emulating', 'also', 'think', 'manny', 'peddy', 'materialistic', 'swooniness', 'crept', 'last', 'several', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'indeed', 'show', 'up', 'one', 'too', 'not', 'so', 'desirable', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'modern', 'relevant', 'so', 'much', 'things.I', 'am', 'also', 'lukewarm', 'similarities', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'story', 'Blair', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'crash', 'when', '1', 'left', 'somebody', 'doorstep', 'later', 'castle', 'magical', 'elements', 'supposed', 'help', 'reach', 'true', 'potential', 'also', 'could', 'see', 'elements', 'Princess', 'Diary', 'movies', 'here', 'However', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'inspiration', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'blatant', 'forgery', 'think', 'still', 'cute', 'respectable', 'movie']",Barbie: Princess Charm School

I have been surprised at how much I liked the old Barbie movies, I have told people most of them are surprisingly good.  The Fashion Fairy tale movies are more what you would think a Barbie movie would be if you had never seen any.  I was apprehensive to let my daughters watch the Charm School movie, but some of the reviews on here were saying it was not so bad.  My kids enjoyed it.  I thought it was so, so but not terrible.  It had maybe 1-2 funny parts.  The story was not very engaging.  I didn't find a really good lesson in the movie, not sure what it was supposed to be.  The dancing and music was pretty lame compared to the older movies also.  I do wonder if the only reason my girls liked this movie was because Barbie was in it, if we owned it I don't think it would be one they requested often to watch like Princess and the Pauper, 12 Dancing Princesses, and the huge favorite of theirs Barbie and the Three Musketeers.",3,getting a little better,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,1042,"['last', 'two', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'daughters', 'watch', 'again', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'old', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'have', 'told', 'people', 'most', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Fashion', 'Fairy', 'tale', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'was', 'apprehensive', 'let', 'daughters', 'watch', 'Charm', 'School', 'movie', 'reviews', 'here', 'were', 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'not', 'terrible', 'had', 'maybe', '1-2', 'funny', 'parts', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'engaging', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'really', 'good', 'lesson', 'movie', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'dancing', 'music', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'compared', 'older', 'movies', 'also', 'do', 'wonder', 'only', 'reason', 'girls', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'Barbie', 'was', 'owned', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'requested', 'often', 'watch', 'Princess', 'Pauper', '12', 'Dancing', 'Princesses', 'huge', 'favorite', 'theirs', 'Barbie', 'Three', 'Musketeers']",Barbie: Princess Charm School

1443166,AEAWKMPKR16DS,B0055SNHP2,Becky,"[3, 5]","Ok OK, why did I watch this? I gave the last 2 previous films 1 star each (wanted to give half a star to both to be honest).I must say, I was pleased to find out they weren't carrying on with the 'Fairy Secret' storyline, which was a sequel to 'Fashion Fairytale'. This is not the same girl, or is it?! The Fashion Fairytale Barbie said she 'acted' in all the Barbie films...confusing really!Upon first seeing the cover of this DVD, I was yet again disgusted, ""Another 'Plastic' and superficial tale"" I thought. I was also angry they were keeping at the stories with these superficial plots and also Barbie's new look and voice judging by the glamourous DVD art. But I gave it a shot anyway.Upon the first few minutes I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Yeah, I did not like the tacky 'Princess School' idea. But at least It didn't seem totally fashion related.Boy oh boy..was I wrong! It wasn't too long into the story that it suddenly got plastic. It happened so fast I couldn't keep up! One second you see the girl in her house, next second you see her whisked off to 'Princess School' on a carriage and you see the area where she lives...graffiti and all, looks like a very run-down area. Then it gets plastic, the annoying fairies are back again too! This time they do sneaky deeds to bad characters and also help out with outfits which instantly disappointed me.Overall the story WAS Better than the previous 2. I don't know if Mattel were trying, but it was better. But still not good enough. I did like how they told Barbie 'No one can make you inferior but yourself'. Which was good for children, but they did not incorporate it in a nice enough way as there was still so much nastiness and bullying towards Barbie as they told her this and even after they said it. Which didn't make that moral stand out. I think the film had too much bullying and cattiness.I also did not like how Barbie was so willing to just go to this 'Charm School' when her adopted mother appeared sick and Barbie seemed to be the only income supporting the family. It was really unrealistic and just upsetting. It didn't seem so safe either, considering it looks like they live in an area of crime judging by the look of the area they live in.I give the film 2 stars as at least it wasn't completely fashion related as the previous 2 and the fairies weren't so prominent in this film. But still not enough heart and morals to give it any higher sadly.As an adult, I will always remember and treasure the original tales I felt taught children good lessons. It was not about how to do things 'properly' and being 'perfect' like the messages come across in this film, but about standing up yourself, being brave, kind, caring and doing things for friends.I could tolerate the new look, new voice and just overall 'NEW' Barbie they are marketing if they made her role model material and not 'marketing' material for money. I really miss Kelly Sheridan, she made the stories more 'Magic'. But even adding her voice to the last 3 films won't do anything to these I'm afraid.I'd personally suggest the original stories up to The Diamond Castle (I don't think Thumbelina, Mermaid Tale or the 3 Musketeers were very good). They taught great morals for girls I think!",2,Ok so I thought I'd try it,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,3264,"['Ok', 'OK', 'why', 'did', 'watch', 'gave', 'last', '2', 'previous', 'films', '1', 'star', 'wanted', 'give', 'star', 'be', 'honest', '.I', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'pleased', 'find', 'out', 'were', ""n't"", 'carrying', ""'Fairy"", 'Secret', 'storyline', 'was', 'sequel', ""'Fashion"", 'Fairytale', 'not', 'same', 'girl', 'Fashion', 'Fairytale', 'Barbie', 'said', ""'acted"", 'Barbie', 'films', 'confusing', 'really', 'first', 'seeing', 'cover', 'DVD', 'was', 'yet', 'again', 'disgusted', ""'Plastic"", 'superficial', 'tale', 'thought', 'was', 'also', 'angry', 'were', 'keeping', 'stories', 'superficial', 'plots', 'also', 'Barbie', 'new', 'look', 'voice', 'judging', 'glamourous', 'DVD', 'art', 'gave', 'shot', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'Yeah', 'did', 'not', 'tacky', ""'Princess"", 'School', 'idea', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'totally', 'fashion', 'related.Boy', 'boy..was', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'story', 'suddenly', 'got', 'plastic', 'happened', 'so', 'fast', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'One', 'second', 'see', 'girl', 'house', 'next', 'second', 'see', 'whisked', 'off', ""'Princess"", 'School', 'carriage', 'see', 'area', 'where', 'graffiti', 'very', 'run-down', 'area', 'Then', 'plastic', 'annoying', 'fairies', 'are', 'back', 'again', 'too', 'time', 'do', 'sneaky', 'deeds', 'bad', 'characters', 'also', 'help', 'out', 'outfits', 'instantly', 'disappointed', 'story', 'WAS', 'Better', 'previous', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Mattel', 'were', 'trying', 'was', 'better', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'told', 'Barbie', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'inferior', 'Which', 'was', 'good', 'children', 'did', 'not', 'incorporate', 'nice', 'enough', 'way', 'was', 'still', 'so', 'much', 'nastiness', 'bullying', 'towards', 'Barbie', 'told', 'even', 'said', 'Which', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'moral', 'stand', 'think', 'film', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'bullying', 'cattiness.I', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'how', 'Barbie', 'was', 'so', 'willing', 'just', 'go', ""'Charm"", 'School', 'when', 'adopted', 'mother', 'appeared', 'sick', 'Barbie', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'income', 'supporting', 'family', 'was', 'really', 'unrealistic', 'just', 'upsetting', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'safe', 'considering', 'live', 'area', 'crime', 'judging', 'look', 'area', 'live', 'in.I', 'give', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'fashion', 'related', 'previous', '2', 'fairies', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'prominent', 'film', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'heart', 'morals', 'give', 'higher', 'sadly.As', 'adult', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'treasure', 'original', 'tales', 'felt', 'taught', 'children', 'good', 'lessons', 'was', 'not', 'how', 'do', 'things', 'being', ""'perfect"", 'messages', 'come', 'film', 'standing', 'up', 'being', 'brave', 'kind', 'caring', 'doing', 'things', 'friends.I', 'could', 'tolerate', 'new', 'look', 'new', 'voice', 'just', 'overall', ""'NEW"", 'Barbie', 'are', 'marketing', 'made', 'role', 'model', 'material', 'not', ""'marketing"", 'material', 'money', 'really', 'miss', 'Kelly', 'Sheridan', 'made', 'stories', 'more', ""'Magic"", 'even', 'adding', 'voice', 'last', '3', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', ""'m"", 'afraid.I', ""'d"", 'personally', 'suggest', 'original', 'stories', 'Diamond', 'Castle', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Thumbelina', 'Mermaid', 'Tale', '3', 'Musketeers', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'taught', 'great', 'morals', 'girls', 'think']",Barbie: Princess Charm School

There was a very short line or two where the head mistress explains to Blair that being a Princess isn't about looking pretty in a tiara, it's about character. Having poise and grace gives you confidence, and that's what Blair needs. She also said ""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent"" but she left out the fact that Eleanor Roosevelt said those wise words. I liked where the movie was heading now, but the rest of the story left much to be desired.Lots of negativity in this movie. Mean girls that bully.

Neither of them understood why Blair would choose Delancy over her best friends, though. (Delancy is actually her cousin, and the other two are real princesses in their own right.

In the meantime, I'll be talking up BARBIE: PRINCESS CHARM SCHOOL. Them evil masterminds over at Mattel have got a good thing going with their series of watchable, wholesome animated films which stars everyone's favorite fashion doll Barbie. It says something that when my tired nieces fell asleep during the screening of this, I kept on watching.First, it's interesting that the Kingdom of Gardania is a blend of modern day world and fairy tale tropes. Cell phones rubbing elbows with enchanted tiaras. In the bustling metropolis Blair Willows toils hard as a cafe waitress, trying to earn enough money to move her family from the poor side of town and provide better medication for her ailing mother. Her big chance comes along when her little sister enters her name in the Princess Charm School lottery and her name is drawn from the pool. Each year one commoner is invited in on that lottery scholarship, except that only 27% of the lottery girls make it thru the semester. If Blair can somehow graduate, she has an opportunity to land financial security as a lady royal.Blair is enthusiastic and friendly, but not exactly up to snuff when it comes to royal etiquette. She can balance a precarious serving tray on her palm but not a stack of books on her noggin whilst walking. As the supportive head mistress notes, Blair has oodles of character but lacks a princess' grace. A despondent Blair remarks: ""I'm like a burp in a symphony."" Heh. It doesn't help that the school's most influential princess-in-training persists in ridiculing her. Maybe the whisperings about a vanished princess have something to do with it? Especially since one royal instructor happens to have marked the resemblance between Blair and the lost heiress to the throne.I liked the contemporary spin put into the story, although, at the same time, enough of the traditional fairy tale elements are retained. No wonder my nieces are hooked on these Barbie movies. With this one, they particularly appreciated the notion of the tiny flying fairies serving as personal assistants to the students. The CG animation is solid and fluid enough, if not spectacular. The key thing is that the visuals don't detract from the story. Barbie as Blair Willows is every little girl's ideal role model. Blair does get down on herself, but never too much, and she always snaps out of her doldrums. She has a forgiving nature, realizing that folks deserve a second chance. She ends up making friends who stand by her. She and her two roommates - two offbeat princesses-in-training - are soon thick as thieves and embarking on a caper to find the lost royal. Just goes to show, so long as you have character, attributes such as poise and class and a regal demeanor sort of naturally fall into place.The DVD's bonus stuff:- All New Barbie Short: ""A Camping We Will Go""- Fake outtakes- ""You Can Tell She's A Princess"" Music Video- Trailer Gallery promoting various Barbie animated films and also BRING IT ON: THE MUSICAL",4,"""I'm like a burp in a symphony.""",1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3067,"['Sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Man', 'Card', ""'re"", 'gon', 'na', 'have', 'pry', 'cold', 'dead', 'hands', 'meantime', ""'ll"", 'be', 'talking', 'up', 'BARBIE', 'PRINCESS', 'CHARM', 'SCHOOL', 'Them', 'evil', 'masterminds', 'Mattel', 'have', 'got', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'series', 'watchable', 'wholesome', 'animated', 'films', 'stars', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'fashion', 'doll', 'Barbie', 'something', 'when', 'tired', 'nieces', 'fell', 'asleep', 'screening', 'kept', 'watching.First', 'interesting', 'Kingdom', 'Gardania', 'blend', 'modern', 'day', 'world', 'fairy', 'tale', 'tropes', 'Cell', 'phones', 'rubbing', 'elbows', 'enchanted', 'tiaras', 'bustling', 'metropolis', 'Blair', 'Willows', 'hard', 'cafe', 'waitress', 'trying', 'earn', 'enough', 'money', 'move', 'family', 'poor', 'side', 'town', 'provide', 'better', 'medication', 'ailing', 'mother', 'big', 'chance', 'along', 'when', 'little', 'sister', 'enters', 'name', 'Princess', 'Charm', 'School', 'lottery', 'name', 'drawn', 'pool', 'year', 'one', 'commoner', 'invited', 'lottery', 'scholarship', 'only', '27', '%', 'lottery', 'girls', 'make', 'semester', 'Blair', 'can', 'somehow', 'graduate', 'opportunity', 'land', 'financial', 'security', 'lady', 'royal.Blair', 'enthusiastic', 'friendly', 'not', 'exactly', 'snuff', 'when', 'royal', 'etiquette', 'can', 'balance', 'precarious', 'serving', 'tray', 'palm', 'not', 'stack', 'books', 'noggin', 'whilst', 'walking', 'supportive', 'head', 'mistress', 'notes', 'Blair', 'oodles', 'character', 'princess', 'grace', 'despondent', 'Blair', 'remarks', ""'m"", 'burp', 'symphony', 'Heh', ""n't"", 'help', 'school', 'most', 'influential', 'princess-in-training', 'persists', 'ridiculing', 'Maybe', 'whisperings', 'vanished', 'princess', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'Especially', 'one', 'royal', 'instructor', 'have', 'marked', 'resemblance', 'Blair', 'lost', 'heiress', 'throne.I', 'liked', 'contemporary', 'spin', 'put', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'enough', 'traditional', 'fairy', 'tale', 'elements', 'are', 'retained', 'wonder', 'nieces', 'are', 'hooked', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'one', 'particularly', 'appreciated', 'notion', 'tiny', 'flying', 'fairies', 'serving', 'personal', 'assistants', 'students', 'CG', 'animation', 'solid', 'fluid', 'enough', 'not', 'spectacular', 'key', 'thing', 'visuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'story', 'Barbie', 'Blair', 'Willows', 'little', 'girl', 'ideal', 'role', 'model', 'Blair', 'get', 'down', 'never', 'too', 'much', 'always', 'doldrums', 'forgiving', 'nature', 'realizing', 'folks', 'deserve', 'second', 'chance', 'up', 'making', 'friends', 'who', 'stand', 'two', 'roommates', 'two', 'princesses-in-training', 'are', 'soon', 'thick', 'thieves', 'embarking', 'caper', 'find', 'lost', 'royal', 'Just', 'show', 'so', 'long', 'have', 'character', 'attributes', 'such', 'poise', 'class', 'regal', 'demeanor', 'sort', 'naturally', 'fall', 'place.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'New', 'Barbie', 'Short', 'Camping', 'Will', 'Go', 'Fake', 'outtakes-', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Princess', 'Music', 'Video-', 'Trailer', 'Gallery', 'promoting', 'various', 'Barbie', 'animated', 'films', 'also', 'BRING', 'IT', 'ON', 'MUSICAL']",Barbie: Princess Charm School

1443190,A3HREUZLLA6GY7,B0055SNHP2,Melanie Lane,"[47, 48]","After increasingly disappointing installments in the Barbie movies line (they had been going down since Mermaid Tale) Barbie has given us a glimmer of light. Princess Charm School (originally dubbed ""Princess Prep School"" but later changed to the more toddler-friendly ""Charm"") brings back so many of the wonderful, whimsical elements we've grown to love about Barbie. Blair is not a movie star, uber trendy and loaded with cash & fashion. She is not an overly preppy teen whose biggest flaw is that her dress isn't up-to-date. She is a very down-to-earth girl who works hard to keep her family afloat. She has problems that, with the help of a very likeable character, she works through.Friendship, forgiveness, kindness, family bond, never giving up, discovering your own talents, and overcoming your own obstacles are all celebrated. The animation (Barbie's face in particular) shows great improvement. For the first time since the Three Musketeers, our heroine doesn't look like an alien Bratz doll with bug eyes and a pointy chin! And the ridiculous Sequin has been traded in for Prince, a cute golden retriever. Alexandria Privet is an excellent character, exhibiting confidence and good manners. She is ladylike and kind-- something you don't often see anymore. Blair, too, is humble and sweet. Towards the end, she begins to show a bit of an ""attitude"" and has the mindset that ""the crown is mine, I DESERVE IT"" which is a bit concerning, but she seems to be still worried about her family.There are really no bad elements in the movie; the disappointments come more in opinion matters. I miss Kelly Sheridan's voice terribly...it's not that Diana Kaarina's voice is bad (although it comes across as annoying and teeny-bopperish), it's more that Kelly IS Barbie and no one- not Diana, not anybody- will ever replace her. Until Mattel gets its corporate head on straight and re-hires Miss Sheridan, Barbie movies will not be the same.The animation, though with serious improvement, is still somewhat lacking. The faces are still stiff, and the lips and eyes are the only things that move. Hair looks as though it's carved out of stone. And even though all of the positive elements are here, Princess Charm School is aimed for a younger audience. It's sad but true...Mattel has officially decided to move in the Hannah Montana/Victorious/ANT Farm and other fame-crazed young audiences.So I give it a 4/5. The trailers for the next two upcoming BMs look promising: Perfect Christmas especially, as it features the whole Barbie family. I'm sad though, that after years of Barbie's baby sister being ""Kelly"", she is now ""Chelsea"". (Seriously....what do they have against Kellys?) Barbie in a Mermaid Tale 2 is the other....not quite as excited about this one, although Mermaid Tale was a decent installment. So fellow oldschool Barbie fans, we can only hope and pray (and wait) for Mattel to listen up. Until then, PCS is a great movie that little girls will love.

1443196,A3FWJFPC486L99,B0055SNHP2,Prometheus I,"[0, 0]","Spoilers:::::My daughters enjoyed it (9 and 3).  I agree that the animation was somewhat better than usual.  I thought the plot was kind of Mermaid Tale on dry land, so I guess they're running out of ideas putting out 2 movies a year.I thought Delancey, who was the daughter of the villain and was the princess-to-be, had a very unrealisitic turn-around at the end.  People can redeem themselves, but I didn't think her change-of-heart at the end was believable.  But it's just a Barbie movie, so enjoy!Later Observation:  Wanted to add that now that I've watched the movie a few bazillion times, that I think this has become my favorite Barbie movie.  I always thought it was weird that the animation on Barbie movies was so primitive while many of the songs were very catchy and memorable.  I would describe the music on this video as dance/disco, but it is very well done and more sophisticated than usual.  The opening song, You Can Tell She's a Princess is a great start and I thought On Top of the World was very meaningful and memorable.  So, great music here.  I thought that they finally ""got Barbie right"" as far as the look and the animation.  Ok, it's not Pixar, but they got rid of the awful face shading ala Nutcracker, Mermadia and most of the early movies where Barbie looked somewhat freakish.  She was beautiful and graceful and looked like I think Barbie should look.Part of the reason that I'm adding this review is that after watching the follow-up, A Perfect Christmas, I really appreciate this movie now.  I thought A Perfect Christmas, while an ok movie, also with some catchy music and a good story, was a step backward from this one.  It had a rushed-to-production look and Barbie looked like a refugee from some cosmetic surgery gulag at the end of the movie.Also, I realized that Delancey's turnaround at the end WAS believable.  Delancey respected royalty and once she realized that Barbie/Blair was the lost princess it was understandable that she would suddenly have respect for her.",4,About What You'd Expect from Barbie,1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,2014,"['Spoilers', 'daughters', 'enjoyed', '9', '3', 'agree', 'animation', 'was', 'somewhat', 'better', 'usual', 'thought', 'plot', 'was', 'kind', 'Mermaid', 'Tale', 'dry', 'land', 'guess', ""'re"", 'running', 'ideas', 'putting', 'out', '2', 'movies', 'year.I', 'thought', 'Delancey', 'who', 'was', 'daughter', 'villain', 'was', 'princess-to-be', 'had', 'very', 'unrealisitic', 'turn-around', 'end', 'People', 'can', 'redeem', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'change-of-heart', 'end', 'was', 'believable', 'just', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoy', 'Later', 'Observation', 'Wanted', 'add', 'now', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'few', 'bazillion', 'times', 'think', 'become', 'favorite', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'weird', 'animation', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'was', 'so', 'primitive', 'many', 'songs', 'were', 'very', 'catchy', 'memorable', 'would', 'describe', 'music', 'video', 'dance/disco', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'usual', 'opening', 'song', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Princess', 'great', 'start', 'thought', 'Top', 'World', 'was', 'very', 'meaningful', 'memorable', 'So', 'great', 'music', 'here', 'thought', 'finally', 'got', 'Barbie', 'right', 'as', 'far', 'look', 'animation', 'Ok', 'not', 'Pixar', 'got', 'rid', 'awful', 'face', 'shading', 'ala', 'Nutcracker', 'Mermadia', 'most', 'early', 'movies', 'where', 'Barbie', 'looked', 'somewhat', 'freakish', 'was', 'beautiful', 'graceful', 'looked', 'think', 'Barbie', 'should', 'look.Part', 'reason', ""'m"", 'adding', 'review', 'watching', 'follow-up', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Christmas', 'really', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'now', 'thought', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Christmas', 'ok', 'movie', 'also', 'catchy', 'music', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'step', 'backward', 'one', 'had', 'rushed-to-production', 'look', 'Barbie', 'looked', 'refugee', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'gulag', 'end', 'movie.Also', 'realized', 'Delancey', 'turnaround', 'end', 'WAS', 'believable', 'Delancey', 'respected', 'royalty', 'once', 'realized', 'Barbie/Blair', 'was', 'lost', 'princess', 'was', 'understandable', 'would', 'suddenly', 'have', 'respect']",Barbie: Princess Charm School

1443203,A2WW57XX2UVLM6,B0055SNHP2,Talvi,"[21, 22]","After a rough patch of less than stellar animation and storytelling (diamond castle, fairy secret), Princess Charm School looks to have been given better production values.  My 8 year old says this is definitely her favorite of the Barbie movies so far (though she misses the movies with songs a lot).The story theme is simple: every girl has the potential to be a princess.  Blair, an ordinary waitress at a pastry shop in a thinly disguised inner city NY type of location, wins a yearly lottery to attend a prestigious ""Princess Academy"".  There, she deals with rivalry and class difficulties while befriending fellow 'outcasts' in her dorm.  Her main rival, Delancy, and Delancy's mother provide the strife and adversity for Blair as she tries to fit in.  The girls learn that there is a long lost princess and Blair fits the description - but she can claim the title only if she can beat Delancy and her avaricious mother to the throne on coronation day.Unlike previous Barbie DVDs, the characters are unique to the story and do not look recycled from previous DVDs.  Also, it was nice to see that the main rival, Delancy's mother, was not a red head (though she wore the typical green color of all of the villains in Barbie movies).  And as with Princess Luciana in Island Princess, Barbie will win over the heart of Delancy and foil Delancy's mother's plans to steal the throne of the country.The characters do resemble their dolls more - though the side characters still have little to do in the movie other than exist as a reason to be a doll.  But the animation of the characters is greatly improved - the 3d animation is less distracting and 'unreal' than in previous DVDs.  It's only until the last frames that the animation looks rushed and much less detailed (dresses move strangely and are lacking shading/realistic details).The story churns along at a steady pace and has all the Barbie movie hallmarks:  Barbie goes on a quest, Barbie encounters diversity, Barbie trains in a montage, Barbie uses friends and ingenuity to overcome obstacles.  One thing that is clear is that they are appealing to a much younger audience this time: all the Charm School girls wear hairstyles suitable to 6 year olds (ponytails and such).One big change is that the comic relief sidekick of the villain is actually funny this time - giving one-liners in a deadpan that does bring a smile.In all, this is much better than the very weak ""Fashion Fairy Tale"" and the dolls that go with the movie are much better quality as well.",4,Barbie Movies are getting better,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,2522,"['rough', 'patch', 'less', 'stellar', 'animation', 'storytelling', 'diamond', 'castle', 'fairy', 'secret', 'Princess', 'Charm', 'School', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'better', 'production', 'values', '8', 'year', 'old', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'movies', 'songs', 'lot', 'story', 'theme', 'simple', 'girl', 'potential', 'be', 'princess', 'Blair', 'ordinary', 'waitress', 'pastry', 'shop', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'inner', 'city', 'NY', 'type', 'location', 'yearly', 'lottery', 'attend', 'prestigious', 'Princess', 'Academy', 'rivalry', 'class', 'difficulties', 'befriending', 'fellow', ""'outcasts"", 'dorm', 'main', 'rival', 'Delancy', 'Delancy', 'mother', 'provide', 'strife', 'adversity', 'Blair', 'fit', 'girls', 'learn', 'long', 'lost', 'princess', 'Blair', 'description', 'can', 'claim', 'title', 'only', 'can', 'beat', 'Delancy', 'avaricious', 'mother', 'throne', 'coronation', 'previous', 'Barbie', 'DVDs', 'characters', 'are', 'unique', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'recycled', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'Also', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'main', 'rival', 'Delancy', 'mother', 'was', 'not', 'red', 'head', 'wore', 'typical', 'green', 'color', 'villains', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'Princess', 'Luciana', 'Island', 'Princess', 'Barbie', 'will', 'win', 'heart', 'Delancy', 'foil', 'Delancy', 'mother', 'plans', 'steal', 'throne', 'country.The', 'characters', 'do', 'resemble', 'dolls', 'more', 'side', 'characters', 'still', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'movie', 'other', 'exist', 'reason', 'be', 'doll', 'animation', 'characters', 'greatly', 'improved', '3d', 'animation', 'less', 'distracting', ""'unreal"", 'previous', 'DVDs', 'only', 'last', 'frames', 'animation', 'rushed', 'much', 'less', 'detailed', 'dresses', 'move', 'strangely', 'are', 'lacking', 'shading/realistic', 'details', '.The', 'story', 'churns', 'along', 'steady', 'pace', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'hallmarks', 'Barbie', 'quest', 'Barbie', 'diversity', 'Barbie', 'montage', 'Barbie', 'friends', 'ingenuity', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'One', 'thing', 'clear', 'are', 'appealing', 'much', 'younger', 'audience', 'time', 'Charm', 'School', 'girls', 'wear', 'hairstyles', 'suitable', '6', 'year', 'olds', 'ponytails', 'such', '.One', 'big', 'change', 'comic', 'relief', 'sidekick', 'villain', 'actually', 'funny', 'time', 'giving', 'one-liners', 'deadpan', 'bring', 'smile.In', 'much', 'better', 'very', 'weak', 'Fashion', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'dolls', 'go', 'movie', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'quality', 'as', 'well']",Barbie: Princess Charm School
1443204,AWNQ2PULUBHDH,B0055SNHP2,"The Escape Artist ""G""","[0, 0]","As pretty much everyone else has stated, I was apprehensive about this movie and was waiting for it to be a dud.  I was pleasantly surprised that Princess Charm School is funny, smart, and sassy - definitely aimed at an older/more mature child.  The story includes the usual storyline where Barbie (or ""Blair"") bests an adversary and they become friends at the end, and of course the villainess gets taken away forever.  There is also the now-mandatory flying fairy characters, as well as the ditzy best friend (reminded me of the highschool girls in Shrek 3).  Blair's backstory will probably confuse very small children and Dame Devon's greedy actions are difficult for smaller kids to understand, so be prepared to answer questions about the former King and Queen.This isn't a full five star movie for me for a few reasons.  First, the blatent toy/movie tie-ins definitely are annoying - granted we're the ideal customer market for this.  I just wish these movies had a bit more substance (sometimes the Golden Books are better than the dvds)!  There are VERY few bonus features (unlike Fairytopia, for example, which had a full 30 minutes of extra features).  But to be fair, the camping with Barbie short was absolutely hilarious (the toy tie-ins are NOT subtle, but it was cute to see the sisters animated together - can't wait for the holiday movie).

1443205,A1PL7QILVQV3IF,B0055SNHP2,"The Taminator ""There's no going back. You've ...","[6, 9]","Barbie movies have been going downhill for the most part, but I was pleasantly surprised with Princess Charm Academy. This film mixes traditional fairy tale stuff like magic and fairies with modern day amenities like broadcast television and Starbucks.Once a year, princesses go to a charm school. If they pass, they ""earn"" their titles of princess. Certain girls born commoners go as well for a chance to be selected as a ""lady royal""--an adviser to the princess. In Gardenia, one commoner girl is selected each year by lottery to attend the school for a chance to be a lady royal, and this year coffee house waitress Blair Willow (Barbie) is selected.Blair doesn't want to go to charm school because she has a little sister and their adoptive mother is sick. The little sister entered her, and Blair changes her mind after talking to her family. She is promptly whisked away to princess charm school for a chance to be a lady royal. A lot of Mean Girls type of stuff happens, Blair discovers she is the long lost princess and true heir to the Gardenian throne, and learns about self-confidence and other life lessons. The villain gets her comeuppance, Blair gets her crown and she makes friends with her young rival, Delancy. Blair's mother (who is looking better by this point) and little sister move into the palace and all ends well.One petite irritation was the Men In Grey (Secret Service pastiches). Most have voices like that OOM PA PA MOW MOW guy in the Oak Ridge Boys with Scottish accents, and very little patience. Somewhere along the line Gardenia must have conquered The 300 or an island of soccer hooligans. (I really want to see a copy of the school handbook, because the academy seems to pull rules and policies out of nowhere.) Also, each student (and teacher apparently) at the academy has a little fairy helper. These recycled Twillerbees seem to be ""good"" or ""bad"" depending on the person to whom they're assigned.This cast of extras has Star Wars Storm Trooper Accuracy(tm), but only at critical moments in the plot. So I guess soft living in the Kingdom of Pinkness is eroding their mad minion skills. However, I especially liked Alexandra Privet, who was the embodiment of a true lady. She was a great role model and a very likable character.I want to address some of the more serious problem points in this movie. Yes, a lot of class time is spent on things like walking with a book on your head, table manners, dancing and other matters of deportment. I never saw Barbie sitting in a class on political science, but they never said things like that weren't included or weren't important, either. An entire montage is spent on Barbie doing homework, including extra work on the fluff like dancing.This movie is targeted at 5 year olds; unless you can figure out how to coat a pre-law curriculum in pink glitter and combine it with at least a few girly things, I don't think it's going to hold their attention for very long, and that may go for a few boys that age as well. Also, considering the behavior I see from kids AND adults these days, I think a few lessons in etiquette and wanting to emulate polite, well-behaved characters couldn't possibly hurt anyone.Princess and lady royal are not the only career paths shown in the film. Barbie's room mates are a soccer player and a DJ, two hobbies/careers that are not traditional ""girlie"" activities. The soccer player does some pretty impressive gymnastics, and the DJ uses her musical skills to get them out of a jam.The teachers and the leader at the academy are all women and it's never mentioned anywhere that there are career paths girls can't take. The only way I found this movie sexist was that it appeared that only a female could take the position of monarch, at least in Gardenia. There was a male academy to provide dance partners in classes and a love interest for Barbie, but that was the extent of boys in the movie (aside from the soccer hooligan guards).I find it difficult to believe that these are major issues when the main villain eliminated two people in a car crash, lies, plants evidence, wrongly detains three minors, attempts to usurp the Gardenian throne, hides the fact that Blair is the rightful heir, has plans to leave an unknown number of poor people homeless with a landscape beautification project, and is just an all-around nasty woman. One of the people she eliminated was likely her own brother from the way her relation to the royal family was described, and Blair was her niece (who she also tried to eliminate). This isn't the first Barbie villain to be guilty of this sort of thing, but are tea and dance lessons really more appalling than all that?This is the first Barbie movie I've actually liked in a long time after a myriad of unwatchable fluff and even overt attempts at political activism. I miss Kelly Sheridan as the voice of Barbie, songs like Princess and the Pauper, and frankly, the characters move like The Sims. Mattel can do better, but they've done much worse. This is a definite improvement over many of its recent predecessors, and I think kids and adults will both enjoy it.",4,Barbie movies are good again-- SPOILER ALERT,1317168000,"09 28,

A hardworking waitress wins a lottery to go to ""princess charm school"" so she can learn to wear makeup, accessorize properly, drink tea, and dance.  If she passes the program, she might get to be a Lady Royal and become an advisor to the princess who is totally unfit to rule if it involves anything more than these few accomplishments.  Not ONCE in this entire movie are these princess/lady royal shown reading books, doing homework, or being involved in anything that is not a stereotypical ""girlie"" activity.  This is the most they can aspire to in their lives--forget being a doctor, a teacher, a leader, a farmer, a policewoman.  All they can hope for is to get to wear a sparkly tiara and be a princess.  Oh, brother.  My oldest daughter HATED the movie and my youngest only likes the parts where they do modern dance.  What a stupid movie for young girls of today with so many opportunities available!
