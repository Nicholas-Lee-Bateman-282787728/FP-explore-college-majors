218869,A36311XF4O81IK,6300215806,A. J. Trivette,"[12, 13]","Carroll Baker COULD have been stunning as Harlow! Numerous stills exist of her in more authentic make-up and costuming and she really did evoke the image of the legendary Harlow. But, sometime between those stills (possibly make-up and costume tests - see the Nov. 2, '63 issue of Sat. Eve. Post), and actual filming, her onscreen look became highly modernized. Gone were Harlow's trademark ""pencil-line"" eyebrows, for instance. And, I think it was a crime not to include a scene of Harlow's most iconic photo being taken - the Time Magazine cover shot of her sitting in her boudoir chair, stunning feather-sleeved negligee', mirror in hand, and her shoe dangling from her foot. My other main complaint is the skimmed-over death of Harlow - one scene she's passing out drunk on the beach, the next she's dying - of pneumonia! Harlow did NOT die of pneumonia; she died from uremic poisoning. This is like having Cleopatra die from heartbreak instead of the bite of an asp! Miss Baker wears Harlow's beauty mark on the upper right side of the chin - Harlow's was on the upper LEFT! So, yes, there are many easily fixable errors to the Harlow look, and several mystifying errors/ommissions to Harlow story. Harlow's death was caused by a beating she received from her husband, Paul Bern. The beating apparently injured her kidney, which resulted in kidney failure/uremic poisoning. And, the whole Paul Bern situation, one of great scandal, tragic humiliation, and the VERY mysterious death of Bern, was as glossed-over as Harlow's death. Unlike today's audiences who DEMAND the ""nitty-gritty"", perhaps the early/mid-60's was not the time to tell the real story of Harlow. With all this said, the film as it was shot, IS entertaining, glamorous, and beautiful in that oh-so-60's kind of way. I'd really like to see the Harlow story done again, with today's standards, and with Drew Barrymore as Harlow! Drew is the right age, has the ""chops"", and BOY does she have the look!",3,True '60's version of a '30's legend,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,1970,"['Carroll', 'Baker', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'stunning', 'Harlow', 'Numerous', 'stills', 'exist', 'more', 'authentic', 'make-up', 'costuming', 'really', 'did', 'evoke', 'image', 'legendary', 'Harlow', 'sometime', 'stills', 'possibly', 'make-up', 'costume', 'tests', 'see', 'Nov.', '2', ""'63"", 'issue', 'Sat', 'Eve', 'Post', 'actual', 'filming', 'onscreen', 'look', 'became', 'highly', 'modernized', 'Gone', 'were', 'Harlow', 'trademark', 'pencil-line', 'eyebrows', 'instance', 'think', 'was', 'crime', 'not', 'include', 'scene', 'Harlow', 'most', 'iconic', 'photo', 'being', 'taken', 'Time', 'Magazine', 'cover', 'shot', 'sitting', 'boudoir', 'chair', 'stunning', 'feather-sleeved', 'negligee', 'mirror', 'hand', 'shoe', 'dangling', 'foot', 'other', 'main', 'complaint', 'skimmed-over', 'death', 'Harlow', 'one', 'scene', 'passing', 'out', 'drunk', 'beach', 'next', 'dying', 'pneumonia', 'Harlow', 'did', 'NOT', 'die', 'pneumonia', 'died', 'uremic', 'poisoning', 'having', 'Cleopatra', 'die', 'heartbreak', 'instead', 'bite', 'asp', 'Miss', 'Baker', 'Harlow', 'beauty', 'mark', 'upper', 'right', 'side', 'chin', 'Harlow', 'was', 'upper', 'LEFT', 'So', 'yes', 'are', 'many', 'easily', 'fixable', 'errors', 'Harlow', 'look', 'several', 'mystifying', 'errors/ommissions', 'Harlow', 'story', 'Harlow', 'death', 'was', 'caused', 'beating', 'received', 'husband', 'Paul', 'Bern', 'beating', 'apparently', 'injured', 'kidney', 'resulted', 'kidney', 'failure/uremic', 'poisoning', 'whole', 'Paul', 'Bern', 'situation', 'one', 'great', 'scandal', 'tragic', 'humiliation', 'VERY', 'mysterious', 'death', 'Bern', 'was', 'as', 'glossed-over', 'Harlow', 'death', 'today', 'audiences', 'who', 'DEMAND', 'nitty-gritty', 'perhaps', 'early/mid-60', 'was', 'not', 'time', 'tell', 'real', 'story', 'Harlow', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'IS', 'entertaining', 'glamorous', 'beautiful', 'oh-so-60', 'kind', 'way', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'see', 'Harlow', 'story', 'done', 'again', 'today', 'standards', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Harlow', 'Drew', 'right', 'age', 'chops', 'BOY', 'have', 'look']",Harlow VHS
218870,A2ZS7TPOJFCMBN,6300215806,BAILADORA FINA,"[9, 10]","Whoever wrote this junkyard of a film should have been permanently barred from writing a film script ever again.  Every aspect of Jean Harlow's life has been fictionalized and/or invented. The only Harlow in this film is the title, otherwise it has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Jean Harlow, her life, and her eventual tragedy and death.  The platinum wig is a rip-off of Marilyn's hair style in the unfinished Something's Got to Give and does not resemble at all Harlow's signature do.  As a matter of fact, this film seems to have a Monroe fixation.  The costumes, fabulous as they may be, are not authentic thirties.  Edith Head most definitely does not give good Head here!  Anachronisms abound and nothing is period, least of all the music, jazzy sixties stuff, which has nothing to do with the twenties or thirties, but sounds totally like it was written for another film and ill inserted into this hallucination.  There is a technical problem with the music track, which is deafeningly loud and hiked up several decibels higher than the dialog track (see my review of Where Love Has Gone for more details).  My main reason for viewing this film was the magnificent Angela Lansbury whose work I always try to get my hands on.  I was sadly disappointed, as she is merely a decoration here and is given absolutely nothing to do throughout the entire film.  Still, she manages to outdo the material and shine brightly in the death scene, her sole moment of glory in this convoluted crap.  Red Buttons, who has much more screen time than Lansbury also manages to turn in a fine performance, but surprisingly, the most memorable turn comes from Raf Vallone as Marino Bello, a role so badly written that the viewer never knows whether Marino is a devil or a saint, a doting stepfather or a gigolo, an illiterate, opera singing Italian or a shrewd businessman.  Credit must be given to Vallone for managing to make a human being out of a cartoon character.  This multiple personalities syndrome also applies to the Harlow role as written, and we are presented with a woman who is  supposedly a virgin but who has a sexual sewer for a mind and is constantly craving to be ravaged by every man she meets, who is both a victim and a tormentor, who both adores and despises her mother, who abhors her stepfather but wants to have sex with him,  who is barely literate or verbal yet comes up with deliciously witty venom worthy of the most vicious drag queen when being interviewed by the press ... the list goes on and on.  With writing like this can anyone actually blame poor Carroll Baker for looking and sounding absolutely miscast?  No actress in the world could have made a human being out of the platinum Barbie doll this script makes of Jean Harlow. This is a sorry mess and you would do well to stay away from it.  On the other hand, if you love so-bad-it's-good campy trash &agrave; la Valley of the Dolls, then this is the perfect film for you.PS - Arroz Con Mango is a Cubanism meaning a big mess, chaos, or confusion.",1,"""ARROZ CON MANGO""",1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,3036,"['Whoever', 'wrote', 'junkyard', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'permanently', 'barred', 'writing', 'film', 'script', 'ever', 'again', 'Every', 'aspect', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'life', 'been', 'fictionalized', 'and/or', 'invented', 'only', 'Harlow', 'film', 'title', 'otherwise', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'life', 'eventual', 'tragedy', 'death', 'platinum', 'wig', 'rip-off', 'Marilyn', 'hair', 'style', 'unfinished', 'Something', 'Got', 'Give', 'not', 'resemble', 'Harlow', 'signature', 'do', 'matter', 'fact', 'film', 'have', 'Monroe', 'fixation', 'costumes', 'fabulous', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'not', 'authentic', 'thirties', 'Edith', 'Head', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'give', 'good', 'Head', 'here', 'Anachronisms', 'abound', 'nothing', 'period', 'least', 'music', 'jazzy', 'sixties', 'stuff', 'nothing', 'do', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'totally', 'was', 'written', 'film', 'ill', 'inserted', 'hallucination', 'technical', 'problem', 'music', 'track', 'deafeningly', 'loud', 'hiked', 'up', 'several', 'decibels', 'higher', 'dialog', 'track', 'see', 'review', 'Where', 'Love', 'Has', 'Gone', 'more', 'details', 'main', 'reason', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', 'magnificent', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'work', 'always', 'try', 'get', 'hands', 'was', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'merely', 'decoration', 'here', 'given', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'entire', 'film', 'Still', 'outdo', 'material', 'shine', 'brightly', 'death', 'scene', 'sole', 'moment', 'glory', 'convoluted', 'crap', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Lansbury', 'also', 'turn', 'fine', 'performance', 'surprisingly', 'most', 'memorable', 'turn', 'Raf', 'Vallone', 'Marino', 'Bello', 'role', 'so', 'badly', 'written', 'viewer', 'never', 'Marino', 'devil', 'saint', 'doting', 'stepfather', 'gigolo', 'illiterate', 'opera', 'singing', 'Italian', 'shrewd', 'businessman', 'Credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Vallone', 'managing', 'make', 'human', 'being', 'cartoon', 'character', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'syndrome', 'also', 'Harlow', 'role', 'written', 'are', 'presented', 'woman', 'who', 'supposedly', 'virgin', 'who', 'sexual', 'sewer', 'mind', 'constantly', 'craving', 'be', 'ravaged', 'man', 'who', 'victim', 'tormentor', 'who', 'adores', 'mother', 'who', 'stepfather', 'have', 'sex', 'who', 'barely', 'literate', 'verbal', 'yet', 'up', 'deliciously', 'witty', 'venom', 'worthy', 'most', 'vicious', 'drag', 'queen', 'when', 'being', 'interviewed', 'press', 'list', 'writing', 'can', 'anyone', 'actually', 'blame', 'poor', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'looking', 'sounding', 'absolutely', 'miscast', 'actress', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'human', 'being', 'platinum', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'script', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'sorry', 'mess', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'stay', 'away', 'other', 'hand', 'love', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'campy', 'trash', 'agrave', 'Valley', 'Dolls', 'then', 'perfect', 'film', 'you.PS', 'Arroz', 'Con', 'Mango', 'Cubanism', 'meaning', 'big', 'mess', 'chaos', 'confusion']",Harlow VHS

218872,A26ZZAVN3C96P0,6300215806,Cookie Crawford,"[3, 3]","There are three major problems with this film, as I see it. 1.) The clumsy movie was written and filmed in a rush, as a rival Jean Harlow biopic was in production at the same time and Paramount Pictures wanted their product to hit theater first, 2.) The movie is made in that synthetically ""lush"" 1960's style that's devoid of human emotion, and results in the feeling you're watching plastic mannequins in a puppet play enacted in an expensive store window, and 3.) For all her talent and beauty, the cooly delicate Carroll Baker is the wrong type to play the earthy and erotic Jean Harlow.As to the story, the script uses practically nothing from the real Jean Harlow's life...which is certainly an odd direction to go in. Harlow was a sexy, down to earth young woman who enjoyed her body, men, and the many perks stardom afforded her. The real center of her life's drama had to do with a religious nut stage mother who leeched off her for money, then refused to call a doctor after her overworked daughter was struck ill with kidney failure, thereby killing her. What the script presents instead is a generic rags to riches climb to fame, where the heroine ultimately finds Hollywood to be a nest of shallow vipers. (Zzzzzzzzz.) If you asked Jean Harlow about her life, I don't imagine that's how she'd have described it.Carroll Baker is an Oscar nominated actress from the world famous Actors Studio, who I greatly admire. She is thoughtful, sensitive and spontaneous in movies like ""BabyDoll,"" ""Giant"" and ""Ironweed,"" (and harshly funny in ""Andy Warhol's BAD"") yet somewhat detached and adrift in the trashy potboilers Paramount put her in (""Sylvia,"" ""The Carpetbaggers"" et al) that seriously lack substance. Also, physically and emotionally, Baker isn't the bombshell type. She's a slender blonde with lovely legs, a modest bustline and a pretty face, but not the brash, good time, voluptuous kewpie doll Harlow was. There's also an inherent intelligence to her manner that makes you wonder just why she endures the piranha characters surrounding her.The movie is interesting to watch as an example of homogenized ""commercial"" filmmaking from the 1960's, which is why I give it 3 stars. Emotionally though, it has next to nothing to offer, and is much more of the 2 star variety. And it is only the cast's collective professionalism that keeps it hanging on at that level.",3,Homogenized Harlow Lite,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,2378,"['are', 'three', 'major', 'problems', 'film', 'see', '1', 'clumsy', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'filmed', 'rush', 'rival', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'biopic', 'was', 'production', 'same', 'time', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'wanted', 'product', 'hit', 'theater', 'first', '2', 'movie', 'made', 'synthetically', 'lush', '1960', 'style', 'devoid', 'human', 'emotion', 'results', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'watching', 'plastic', 'mannequins', 'puppet', 'play', 'enacted', 'expensive', 'store', 'window', '3', 'talent', 'beauty', 'cooly', 'delicate', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'wrong', 'type', 'play', 'earthy', 'erotic', 'Jean', 'Harlow.As', 'story', 'script', 'practically', 'nothing', 'real', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'life', 'certainly', 'odd', 'direction', 'go', 'Harlow', 'was', 'sexy', 'down', 'earth', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'body', 'men', 'many', 'perks', 'stardom', 'afforded', 'real', 'center', 'life', 'drama', 'had', 'do', 'religious', 'nut', 'stage', 'mother', 'who', 'leeched', 'off', 'money', 'then', 'refused', 'call', 'doctor', 'overworked', 'daughter', 'was', 'struck', 'ill', 'kidney', 'failure', 'thereby', 'killing', 'What', 'script', 'presents', 'instead', 'generic', 'rags', 'riches', 'climb', 'fame', 'where', 'heroine', 'ultimately', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'nest', 'shallow', 'vipers', 'Zzzzzzzzz', 'asked', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', ""'d"", 'have', 'described', 'it.Carroll', 'Baker', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'actress', 'world', 'famous', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'who', 'greatly', 'admire', 'thoughtful', 'sensitive', 'spontaneous', 'movies', 'BabyDoll', 'Giant', 'Ironweed', 'harshly', 'funny', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'BAD', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'detached', 'adrift', 'trashy', 'potboilers', 'Paramount', 'put', 'Sylvia', 'Carpetbaggers', 'al', 'seriously', 'lack', 'substance', 'Also', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'Baker', ""n't"", 'bombshell', 'type', 'slender', 'blonde', 'lovely', 'legs', 'modest', 'bustline', 'pretty', 'face', 'not', 'brash', 'good', 'time', 'voluptuous', 'kewpie', 'doll', 'Harlow', 'was', 'also', 'inherent', 'intelligence', 'manner', 'wonder', 'just', 'why', 'piranha', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'her.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'watch', 'example', 'homogenized', 'commercial', 'filmmaking', '1960', 'why', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'Emotionally', 'next', 'nothing', 'offer', 'much', 'more', '2', 'star', 'variety', 'only', 'cast', 'collective', 'professionalism', 'hanging', 'level']",Harlow VHS

218874,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,6300215806,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[4, 6]","I remember Jean Harlow (1911-1937) as a vibrant,  vivacious, spirited comedienne who could easily hold her own on screen opposite such actors as Wallace Berry, Clark Gable, and Spencer Tracy. She is nowhere to be found in this movie. ""Harlow"" (1965) unfortunately lives up to its notorious reputation as one of the worst biopics of all time. The movie functions as a prime example of both the best and worst of 1960's cinema schlock.Carroll Baker earns points for giving the title role all she has to give. Still, that's not saying much. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes (who also wrote the screenplays for such other  bad movies we love as ""Torch Song"" and ""Where Love Has Gone"") is such a tacky-trashy mess, it doesn't matter if Baker is playing Jean Harlow, Baby Doll, herself, or any fictional platinum-blonde, sexy, self-destructive starlet. Angela Lansbury miraculously manages to bring some dignity and class to the thankless role of Harlow's freeloading,  sexually addicted, suffocating mother. But  nothing else about this gaudy, garish production (sets, costumes, and definitely not Neal Hefti's obnoxiously loud and inappropriate musical score) rings true. The movie has no sense of characters, time, or place, and ends up existing in an odd time-warp version of the 1920's-1930's meets the 1960's.Are we honestly supposed to believe that Arthur Landau (Red Buttons) was such a saintly agent that he initially agreed to represent a desperate and starving Harlow for $1.00? Later, Landau tells her to get out of a movie contract by, basically, acting like a sexual tease. When Baker's Harlow enters Leslie Nielsen's (as a fictional, unscrupulous movie mogul based on Howard Hughes) outlandishly decorated house, she declares, ""I wonder if I'm in heaven or hell."" Oh, you're in celluloid hell, honey! An enraged Nielsen rips her Edith Head gown, throws her on his bed, and finally dismisses her as a ""sexual curiousity."" A hard-working Harlow eventually lands a better contract at Majestic Studios (headed by Martin Balsam in a fictional role based on MGM'S Louis B. Mayer) and a star dressing room. A fictional actor portrayed by Michael Connors instantly enters and declares, ""Welcome to the velvet prison.""After the mysterious suicide of her second husband Paul Bern (portrayed here as her impotent first husband by Peter Lawford), the real-life Jean Harlow consented to a studio arranged marriage to her friend Harold Rossen, a cinematographer at MGM. After their divorce, she settled into a loving relationship with actor William Powell. Her career was going well and she was well-liked by her co-stars and the public at the time of her untimely death from kidney failure at age 26 in 1937. The movie completely ignores all of this. After Bern's suicide, Baker's Harlow looks for love in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways; including throwing herself at her stepfather (Raf Vallone) whom she always hated! Baker's thoroughly fictional Harlow ends up an alcoholic has-been. She is eventually discovered, looking like pure hell, on a beach. Shortly thereafter, she dies of pneumonia, with Lansbury and Buttons, weeping at her  hospital bedside! Buttons says the ridiculous end lines, ""She didn't die of pneumonia. She died of life!"" This should be sad, but ""Harlow"" is laughable Hollywood hokum from beginning to end.",2,"""I WONDER IF I'M IN HEAVEN OR HELL"": PURE 1960'S SCHLOCK",1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,3345,"['remember', 'Jean', 'Harlow', '1911-1937', 'vibrant', 'vivacious', 'spirited', 'comedienne', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'hold', 'own', 'screen', 'opposite', 'such', 'actors', 'Wallace', 'Berry', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'movie', 'Harlow', '1965', 'unfortunately', 'up', 'notorious', 'reputation', 'one', 'worst', 'biopics', 'time', 'movie', 'functions', 'prime', 'example', 'best', 'worst', '1960', 'cinema', 'schlock.Carroll', 'Baker', 'points', 'giving', 'title', 'role', 'give', 'Still', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Michael', 'Hayes', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplays', 'such', 'other', 'bad', 'movies', 'love', 'Torch', 'Song', 'Where', 'Love', 'Has', 'Gone', 'such', 'tacky-trashy', 'mess', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Baker', 'playing', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'fictional', 'platinum-blonde', 'sexy', 'self-destructive', 'starlet', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'miraculously', 'bring', 'dignity', 'class', 'thankless', 'role', 'Harlow', 'freeloading', 'sexually', 'addicted', 'suffocating', 'mother', 'nothing', 'else', 'gaudy', 'garish', 'production', 'sets', 'costumes', 'definitely', 'not', 'Neal', 'Hefti', 'obnoxiously', 'loud', 'inappropriate', 'musical', 'score', 'true', 'movie', 'sense', 'characters', 'time', 'place', 'up', 'existing', 'odd', 'time-warp', 'version', ""1920's-1930"", 'meets', ""1960's.Are"", 'honestly', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Arthur', 'Landau', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'was', 'such', 'saintly', 'agent', 'initially', 'agreed', 'represent', 'desperate', 'starving', 'Harlow', '1.00', 'Later', 'Landau', 'get', 'movie', 'contract', 'basically', 'acting', 'sexual', 'tease', 'When', 'Baker', 'Harlow', 'enters', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'fictional', 'unscrupulous', 'movie', 'mogul', 'based', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'outlandishly', 'decorated', 'house', 'wonder', ""'m"", 'heaven', 'hell', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'celluloid', 'hell', 'honey', 'enraged', 'Nielsen', 'Edith', 'Head', 'gown', 'bed', 'finally', 'sexual', 'curiousity', 'hard-working', 'Harlow', 'eventually', 'better', 'contract', 'Majestic', 'Studios', 'headed', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'fictional', 'role', 'based', 'MGM', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'star', 'dressing', 'room', 'fictional', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'Michael', 'Connors', 'instantly', 'enters', 'declares', 'Welcome', 'velvet', 'prison', 'mysterious', 'suicide', 'second', 'husband', 'Paul', 'Bern', 'portrayed', 'here', 'impotent', 'first', 'husband', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'real-life', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'consented', 'studio', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'friend', 'Harold', 'Rossen', 'cinematographer', 'MGM', 'divorce', 'settled', 'loving', 'relationship', 'actor', 'William', 'Powell', 'career', 'was', 'going', 'well', 'was', 'well-liked', 'co-stars', 'public', 'time', 'untimely', 'death', 'kidney', 'failure', 'age', '26', '1937', 'movie', 'completely', 'Bern', 'suicide', 'Baker', 'Harlow', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'wrong', 'ways', 'including', 'throwing', 'stepfather', 'Raf', 'Vallone', 'whom', 'always', 'hated', 'Baker', 'thoroughly', 'fictional', 'Harlow', 'up', 'alcoholic', 'has-been', 'eventually', 'discovered', 'looking', 'pure', 'hell', 'beach', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'pneumonia', 'Lansbury', 'Buttons', 'weeping', 'hospital', 'bedside', 'Buttons', 'ridiculous', 'end', 'lines', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'pneumonia', 'died', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'sad', 'Harlow', 'laughable', 'Hollywood', 'hokum', 'beginning', 'end']",Harlow VHS

""Harlow"" with Carol Lynley, from the same year.Perhaps more thought would have gone into the Baker version: the 1965 music permeating the movie depicting 1935 may have been scrapped in favor of ""period"" music, the storyline adjusted to fit the ""real"" story, some of the bludgeoning soliliques removed - though the script is excellent, and I daresay strong enugh to be played on a Broadway stage at the time.What the big-budget version has, most notably is consistently great performances. Carroll Baker is, to me, one of the best actresses on the silver screen, her acting is absolutely astonishing in this film: I strong believe she did an Oscar-worthy job. Red Buttons, as the Agent, also does well; Mike Connors, Leslie Nielson, Angela Lansbury, et. al., are exceptionally expressive for a movie considered now to be on the level of ""The Oscar"", or other huge productions of the '60s, which went awry artistically.The screenplay, though as I mentioned above, is a bit over the top, especially as it injects 1965 historical observations into a very early period in movies, when movies with spoken dialogue were called ""talkies"", and there simply were not that many fallen idols to draw upon. There was no development of the theme of a 17 year old beauty, playing bit parts in frantic slapstick two-reelers, suddenly finding herself a (controversial) lead actress in features with sound.Additionally, there is actually very little physical resemblance of Baker to Harlow: Baker is a ""Classic"" beauty while Harlow is attractive and possessing that ""animal magnetism"". Also, Baker is not ""17"" by any stretch - though she's more believable (visually) by the end of the movie, when Jean Harlow was in her mid 20s.Cinematography, sets, are impressive; though chromatics are '60s, not '30s.",4,Acting and writing bring it up to *4* stars,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,1880,"['was', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'rushed', 'out', 'compete', 'Made-For-TV', 'shot', 'videotape', 'Harlow', 'Carol', 'Lynley', 'same', 'year.Perhaps', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'Baker', 'version', '1965', 'music', 'permeating', 'movie', 'depicting', '1935', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'scrapped', 'favor', 'period', 'music', 'storyline', 'adjusted', 'fit', 'real', 'story', 'bludgeoning', 'soliliques', 'removed', 'script', 'excellent', 'daresay', 'strong', 'enugh', 'be', 'played', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'time.What', 'big-budget', 'version', 'most', 'notably', 'consistently', 'great', 'performances', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'silver', 'screen', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'astonishing', 'film', 'strong', 'believe', 'did', 'Oscar-worthy', 'job', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'Agent', 'also', 'well', 'Mike', 'Connors', 'Leslie', 'Nielson', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'et', 'al.', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'expressive', 'movie', 'considered', 'now', 'be', 'level', 'Oscar', 'other', 'huge', 'productions', ""'60s"", 'went', 'artistically.The', 'screenplay', 'mentioned', 'bit', 'top', 'especially', '1965', 'historical', 'observations', 'very', 'early', 'period', 'movies', 'when', 'movies', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'were', 'called', 'talkies', 'there', 'simply', 'were', 'not', 'many', 'fallen', 'idols', 'draw', 'upon', 'was', 'development', 'theme', '17', 'year', 'old', 'beauty', 'playing', 'bit', 'parts', 'frantic', 'slapstick', 'two-reelers', 'suddenly', 'finding', 'controversial', 'lead', 'actress', 'features', 'sound.Additionally', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'Baker', 'Harlow', 'Baker', 'Classic', 'beauty', 'Harlow', 'attractive', 'possessing', 'animal', 'magnetism', 'Also', 'Baker', 'not', '17', 'stretch', 'more', 'believable', 'visually', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'was', 'mid', '20s.Cinematography', 'sets', 'are', 'impressive', 'chromatics', 'are', ""'60s"", 'not']",Harlow VHS

This film is an attempt to cash in on her fame, and is therefore a curiosity to fans, but it is certainly no loving tribute.The film starts out decently enough. Jean Harlow (Carroll Baker) haunts the studios looking for work, and getting very little of it. She wanders onto the set of a western one day at lunchtime, hoping to fall into a meal, and she meets agent Arthur Landau (Red Buttons). Landau is looking for a client to represent, and Harlow seems perfect, so despite having to take quite a few risks, he asks to represent her. Mogul Richard Manley (Leslie Nielson) takes an interest in her and gets her work in slapstick comedies, but drops her when she refuses to become another conquest on his wall.But at least now she has her foot in the door. With her publicity as a wisecracking sex symbol, she becomes a big star, but there is something she is aching for despite her success. After a talk with Mama Jean (Angela Lansbury) about her love life with Latin lover Marino Bello (Raf Vallone), she decides that what she needs is to be seduced. She hopes to find passion with Paul Bern (Peter Lawford), but discovers on their wedding night that he is unable to perform. His suicide leads her to seek solace in any man's bed, and after a night of drinking and sex, Harlow sleeps on the beach. This gives her pnuemonia which causes her untimely death at 26.How wrong can a movie get? Harlow began as a rich girl, with no need for fame, but her mother pushed her to become a star. Once famous, she became everyone's kid sister, the girl who everyone looked out for. She was married before she achieved fame, so she was by no means a virgin when she met Paul Bern. In fact, some people who believe that Bern was impotent claim that she knew about his shortcomings and married him for them to escape being pawed constantly. However, there are serious doubts about the impotence claims; Bern had a common law marriage for years before coming to Hollywood. And the idea that Harlow became sex-starved and that this affliction led to her death is preposterous! She died because of kidney failure due to uremic poisoning, a condition that was hard to detect in the middle 1930s. What is even more shocking is that this film suggests that Harlow's career was waning toward the end of her life, which couldn't be further from the truth. She was still the bright star that she was at the height of her fame, which is why her death rattled the world.It is funny that it was not Harlow's own studio of MGM, but rival Paramount that made this film. Was there some underlying animosity there? Perhaps. What is clear is that someone somewhere involved had little regard for Harlow's memory and wasn't very disturbed by tarnishing her reputation. They also ignored the time period. Baker's hair is of a 1960s style, the music is anachronistic, and the money used is modern. This film is only worthy of seasoned Harlow fans who are just curious.",2,Not the Real Harlow,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,3039,"['Jean', 'Harlow', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'stars', '1930s', 'early', 'death', '26', 'shocked', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'attempt', 'cash', 'fame', 'therefore', 'curiosity', 'fans', 'certainly', 'no', 'loving', 'tribute.The', 'film', 'out', 'decently', 'enough', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'studios', 'looking', 'work', 'getting', 'very', 'little', 'set', 'western', 'one', 'day', 'lunchtime', 'hoping', 'fall', 'meal', 'agent', 'Arthur', 'Landau', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'Landau', 'looking', 'client', 'represent', 'Harlow', 'perfect', 'so', 'having', 'take', 'quite', 'few', 'risks', 'represent', 'Mogul', 'Richard', 'Manley', 'Leslie', 'Nielson', 'interest', 'work', 'slapstick', 'comedies', 'when', 'become', 'conquest', 'wall.But', 'least', 'now', 'foot', 'door', 'publicity', 'wisecracking', 'sex', 'symbol', 'big', 'star', 'something', 'aching', 'success', 'talk', 'Mama', 'Jean', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'love', 'life', 'Latin', 'lover', 'Marino', 'Bello', 'Raf', 'Vallone', 'what', 'be', 'seduced', 'find', 'passion', 'Paul', 'Bern', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'discovers', 'wedding', 'night', 'unable', 'perform', 'suicide', 'seek', 'solace', 'man', 'bed', 'night', 'drinking', 'sex', 'Harlow', 'beach', 'pnuemonia', 'untimely', 'death', '26.How', 'wrong', 'can', 'movie', 'get', 'Harlow', 'began', 'rich', 'girl', 'need', 'fame', 'mother', 'pushed', 'become', 'star', 'Once', 'famous', 'became', 'everyone', 'kid', 'sister', 'girl', 'who', 'everyone', 'looked', 'out', 'was', 'married', 'achieved', 'fame', 'was', 'virgin', 'when', 'met', 'Paul', 'Bern', 'fact', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'Bern', 'was', 'impotent', 'claim', 'knew', 'shortcomings', 'married', 'escape', 'being', 'pawed', 'constantly', 'However', 'are', 'serious', 'doubts', 'impotence', 'claims', 'Bern', 'had', 'common', 'law', 'marriage', 'years', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'idea', 'Harlow', 'became', 'sex-starved', 'affliction', 'led', 'death', 'preposterous', 'died', 'kidney', 'failure', 'due', 'uremic', 'poisoning', 'condition', 'was', 'hard', 'detect', 'middle', '1930s', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'film', 'Harlow', 'career', 'was', 'waning', 'end', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'was', 'still', 'bright', 'star', 'was', 'height', 'fame', 'why', 'death', 'rattled', 'world.It', 'funny', 'was', 'not', 'Harlow', 'own', 'studio', 'MGM', 'rival', 'Paramount', 'made', 'film', 'Was', 'underlying', 'animosity', 'there', 'Perhaps', 'What', 'clear', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'involved', 'had', 'little', 'regard', 'Harlow', 'memory', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'disturbed', 'tarnishing', 'reputation', 'also', 'ignored', 'time', 'period', 'Baker', 'hair', '1960s', 'style', 'music', 'anachronistic', 'money', 'used', 'modern', 'film', 'only', 'worthy', 'seasoned', 'Harlow', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'curious']",Harlow VHS

The young blonde was years before Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield. But, a star in her period and was discovered by Howard Hughes. As far as historical accuracy, it seems to be a telling story of her life in tinseltown. Carroll Baker, who you should know from BABY DOLL and GIANT, to name a couple, is worth buying and it is sold on Amazon.David Stenn's ""BOMB SHELL,"" book, the 'Life of Jean Harlow,' was sitting on my bookcase shelf gathering dust. I have more than 100 bios of Stars and have read about half of them. I bought them as they were written to read while I retire, which I now am. I am sure that her life differs from the film.
