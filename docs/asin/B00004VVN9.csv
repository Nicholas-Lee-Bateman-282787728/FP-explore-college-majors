Sadly, this remastered version is not in a format fit for viewing. The original concept was to present scenes viewed from the aspect of the individual wearing the experimental headset in one format, while the balance of the shots were presented in another format. In this rendition, the scenes from the aspect of the experimenter are presented in great widescreen format with high quality Dolby sound. Unfortunately, most of the story is not presented from the aspect of the experimenter and is put forth in a small format with no appreciable sound quality at all. Be prepared to squint a lot and keep adjusting the volume.

552741,A1CE16L65HWOOL,B00004VVN9,"Amazon Customer ""Dean Wall""","[6, 6]","The Movie Brainstorm was a Major Special Effects Milestone directed by Douglas Trumbull of 2001: a space odyssey, special effects fame.The movie was shot and edited in 70mm, and had a Dolby Stereo soundtrack that went from Center Channel for all 'real-life,' sequences...and L/R channels (extremely separated) on the TRIAD/Brainstorm sequences. While the audio jumped back and forth, the VISUAL element went from modest widescreen to 70mm SUPER Panavision, during the TRIAD/Brainstorm sequences.On the ""Remastered Version"" the video is Letterboxed. This is one of the best treatments for the home viewer. The AUDIO soundtrack was RUINED by going from Dolby 2.0 to 5.1. The center channel remains ON during the side-to-side separation sequences, diminishing, and even overwhelming, the effect. SLOPPY! (Some tech sitting in a cubicle probably just threw the audio into a regular upgrade program and went for coffee...)This AUDIO, KILLS the overall effect, ruining the DVD release.On the LASERVIDEO released in the 1980's, in the first STEREO format for Home Video, the audio matrixing was embedded in the original stereo code, and survives intact, to be decoded by your sound Dolby unit. But the visuals are SQUASHED...That is the FULL SCREEN treatment (released before Letterboxing caught on.) was at least compensated for a little bit by inserting anamorphic video during the Brainstorm Device sequences. While it DOES disturb the visuals, the anamorphic distorted video does present a surreal effect, by not jumping down to horizontal Letterbox! BUT, AT LEAST SOMETHING DIFFERENT happens to the Sight and Sound during the TRIAD/Brainstorm sequences...The movie is somewhat uncomfortable to watch. With, a smoker in a lab, the estranged relationship between two of the main characters, the conflict between using the TRIAD/Brainstorm Device for good or evil, the mundane conversations that reveal foreshadowing insights....but, it IS thought-provoking when presented in the original visual and audio format.REMASTER slight disappointment, ...MAYBE they'll get it 100% right on Blu-Ray (IF criterion picks up the ball.)",2,REMASTERED DVD vs 80's LASERVIDEO,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,2119,"['Movie', 'Brainstorm', 'was', 'Major', 'Special', 'Effects', 'Milestone', 'directed', 'Douglas', 'Trumbull', '2001', 'space', 'odyssey', 'special', 'effects', 'fame.The', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'edited', '70mm', 'had', 'Dolby', 'Stereo', 'soundtrack', 'went', 'Center', 'Channel', ""'real-life"", 'sequences', 'L/R', 'channels', 'extremely', 'separated', 'TRIAD/Brainstorm', 'sequences', 'audio', 'jumped', 'back', 'forth', 'VISUAL', 'element', 'went', 'modest', 'widescreen', '70mm', 'SUPER', 'Panavision', 'TRIAD/Brainstorm', 'sequences.On', 'Remastered', 'Version', 'video', 'Letterboxed', 'one', 'best', 'treatments', 'home', 'viewer', 'AUDIO', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'RUINED', 'going', 'Dolby', '2.0', '5.1', 'center', 'channel', 'ON', 'side-to-side', 'separation', 'sequences', 'diminishing', 'even', 'overwhelming', 'effect', 'SLOPPY', 'tech', 'sitting', 'cubicle', 'probably', 'just', 'threw', 'audio', 'regular', 'upgrade', 'program', 'went', 'coffee', 'AUDIO', 'KILLS', 'overall', 'effect', 'ruining', 'DVD', 'LASERVIDEO', 'released', '1980', 'first', 'STEREO', 'format', 'Home', 'Video', 'audio', 'matrixing', 'was', 'embedded', 'original', 'stereo', 'code', 'intact', 'be', 'decoded', 'sound', 'Dolby', 'unit', 'visuals', 'are', 'SQUASHED', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'treatment', 'released', 'Letterboxing', 'caught', 'was', 'least', 'compensated', 'little', 'bit', 'inserting', 'anamorphic', 'video', 'Brainstorm', 'Device', 'sequences', 'DOES', 'disturb', 'visuals', 'anamorphic', 'distorted', 'video', 'present', 'surreal', 'effect', 'not', 'jumping', 'down', 'horizontal', 'Letterbox', 'BUT', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'SOMETHING', 'DIFFERENT', 'Sight', 'Sound', 'TRIAD/Brainstorm', 'sequences', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'smoker', 'lab', 'estranged', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'conflict', 'using', 'TRIAD/Brainstorm', 'Device', 'good', 'evil', 'mundane', 'conversations', 'reveal', 'foreshadowing', 'insights', '.but', 'thought-provoking', 'when', 'presented', 'original', 'visual', 'audio', 'format.REMASTER', 'slight', 'disappointment', 'MAYBE', ""'ll"", 'get', '100', '%', 'right', 'Blu-Ray', 'IF', 'criterion', 'up', 'ball']",N/A
552742,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B00004VVN9,Andre Dursin,"[12, 12]","Award-winning special effects genius Douglas Trumbull's ""Brainstorm"" experienced plenty of behind the scenes turbulence en route to the big screen: after having nearly completed filming, co-star Natalie Wood mysteriously drowned, leading its studio (MGM/UA) to file an insurance claim with Lloyd's of London in an effort to junk the film. (It's incredibly ironic this disc is being released right after the L.A. coroner's office newly designated the cause of Wood's death as ""undetermined"" as well). Trumbull - who produced and directed the film - fought to get the picture finished, and while he ultimately won (the insurance company gave him $3 million to complete post-production), the battle ended up driving him away from ever wanting to direct another feature.The finished film is a bit disjointed, as one might anticipate, yet retains enough of Trumbull's fascinating technical wizardry to warrant a recommendation for interested viewers. Christopher Walken stars as a research scientist working with Louise Fletcher to design what would be, today, seen as the first ""virtual reality"" device: a headset that records the images and thoughts of a human being, enabling another to relive their experiences. Devised for any kind of human interaction, the device naturally attracts the interest of devious government agents who want to utilize it for their own military applications; Walken, though, becomes obsessed with finding out what Fletcher experienced after she used the device to record her own death.Bruce Joel Rubin (""Ghost,"" ""Dreamscape,"" ""Jacob's Ladder"") wrote the original story for ""Brainstorm,"" but Robert Stitzel and Philip Frank Messina were credited with the film's final screenplay. It's hard to envision that Rubin's original script wouldn't have been more compelling than the uneven dramatic situations that ""Brainstorm"" eventually throws at viewers, with limp dialogue and obvious improvisation on the part of Walken clashing with the otherwise dry performances of Wood, Fletcher and Cliff Robertson. Stories about Trumbull being unable to handle the actors and creating tension on set are unsurprising when you see the finished product, but much like ""Altered States,"" the film works best as a technical showcase in the first place. Trumbull's interest in human perception and experience - and ultimately bridging science with the spiritual - still comes across in the film, with a few affecting moments provided along the way.Trumbull initially envisioned ""Brainstorm"" as a showcase for a new technical process he dubbed ""Showscan,"" yet ultimately decided - for practical and economic reasons - to shoot the film in both 35mm (roughly 1.85) for its ""real world"" scenes and 70mm widescreen (2.35 with full stereo sound) for its ""Brainstorm"" sequences. The effectiveness of this approach naturally works best on a large theater screen, though Warner has opted to utilize a straight 2.35 aspect ratio for ""Brainstorm""'s Blu-Ray release. This means most of the film is 1.78 in a 2.35 aspect ratio (with black on all four sides of the image) with the exception of the ""virtual reality"" sequences, which blast into 5.1 DTS MA and full 2.35. The effect isn't as potent as it would be in a theater, yet after awhile, the home viewer can still gain an appreciation of Trumbull's intentions.Some of the movie's visual effects and early CGI are interesting for their time - particularly during the movie's intriguing, if obviously compromised, ending, which seems to have been cut around Wood's death. James Horner's effective early score is a major plus to the film, which ended up underperforming in theaters upon its eventual release in September, 1983.Warner's Blu-Ray looks quite good with a satisfying 1080p AVC encoded transfer and DTS MA soundtrack. The original three-minute theatrical trailer is also included, featuring some interesting special effects footage that didn't make it into the final cut.",3,Disjointed Sci-Fi Thriller Made More Interesting By High-Definition,1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,3928,"['Award-winning', 'special', 'effects', 'genius', 'Douglas', 'Trumbull', 'Brainstorm', 'experienced', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'turbulence', 'route', 'big', 'screen', 'having', 'nearly', 'completed', 'filming', 'co-star', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'mysteriously', 'drowned', 'leading', 'studio', 'MGM/UA', 'file', 'insurance', 'claim', 'Lloyd', 'London', 'effort', 'junk', 'film', 'incredibly', 'ironic', 'disc', 'being', 'released', 'right', 'L.A.', 'coroner', 'office', 'newly', 'designated', 'cause', 'Wood', 'death', 'undetermined', 'as', 'well', 'Trumbull', 'who', 'produced', 'directed', 'film', 'fought', 'get', 'picture', 'finished', 'ultimately', 'won', 'insurance', 'company', 'gave', '3', 'million', 'complete', 'post-production', 'battle', 'ended', 'up', 'driving', 'away', 'ever', 'wanting', 'direct', 'feature.The', 'finished', 'film', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'one', 'might', 'anticipate', 'yet', 'enough', 'Trumbull', 'fascinating', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'warrant', 'recommendation', 'interested', 'viewers', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'research', 'scientist', 'working', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'design', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'today', 'seen', 'first', 'virtual', 'reality', 'device', 'headset', 'images', 'thoughts', 'human', 'being', 'enabling', 'relive', 'experiences', 'Devised', 'kind', 'human', 'interaction', 'device', 'naturally', 'interest', 'devious', 'government', 'agents', 'who', 'want', 'utilize', 'own', 'military', 'applications', 'Walken', 'though', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'Fletcher', 'experienced', 'used', 'device', 'record', 'own', 'death.Bruce', 'Joel', 'Rubin', 'Ghost', 'Dreamscape', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'wrote', 'original', 'story', 'Brainstorm', 'Robert', 'Stitzel', 'Philip', 'Frank', 'Messina', 'were', 'credited', 'film', 'final', 'screenplay', 'hard', 'envision', 'Rubin', 'original', 'script', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'compelling', 'uneven', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'Brainstorm', 'eventually', 'viewers', 'limp', 'dialogue', 'obvious', 'improvisation', 'part', 'Walken', 'clashing', 'otherwise', 'dry', 'performances', 'Wood', 'Fletcher', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Stories', 'Trumbull', 'being', 'unable', 'handle', 'actors', 'creating', 'tension', 'set', 'are', 'unsurprising', 'when', 'see', 'finished', 'product', 'much', 'Altered', 'States', 'film', 'best', 'technical', 'showcase', 'first', 'place', 'Trumbull', 'interest', 'human', 'perception', 'experience', 'ultimately', 'bridging', 'science', 'spiritual', 'still', 'film', 'few', 'affecting', 'moments', 'provided', 'way.Trumbull', 'initially', 'envisioned', 'Brainstorm', 'showcase', 'new', 'technical', 'process', 'dubbed', 'Showscan', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'decided', 'practical', 'economic', 'reasons', 'shoot', 'film', '35mm', 'roughly', '1.85', 'real', 'world', 'scenes', '70mm', 'widescreen', '2.35', 'full', 'stereo', 'sound', 'Brainstorm', 'sequences', 'effectiveness', 'approach', 'naturally', 'best', 'large', 'theater', 'screen', 'Warner', 'opted', 'utilize', 'straight', '2.35', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Brainstorm', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'most', 'film', '1.78', '2.35', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'black', 'four', 'sides', 'image', 'exception', 'virtual', 'reality', 'sequences', 'blast', '5.1', 'DTS', 'MA', 'full', '2.35', 'effect', ""n't"", 'as', 'potent', 'would', 'be', 'theater', 'yet', 'awhile', 'home', 'viewer', 'can', 'still', 'gain', 'appreciation', 'Trumbull', 'intentions.Some', 'movie', 'visual', 'effects', 'early', 'CGI', 'are', 'interesting', 'time', 'particularly', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'obviously', 'compromised', 'ending', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'Wood', 'death', 'James', 'Horner', 'effective', 'early', 'score', 'major', 'plus', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'underperforming', 'theaters', 'eventual', 'release', 'September', '1983.Warner', 'Blu-Ray', 'looks', 'quite', 'good', 'satisfying', '1080p', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'transfer', 'DTS', 'MA', 'soundtrack', 'original', 'three-minute', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'also', 'included', 'featuring', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'footage', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'cut']",N/A

So, film purists, don't attack me;  I was singing praises of preserving a film's aspect ratio and bought letterboxed laserdiscs before dvd back in the early 90s when some of you were kids watching Home Alone movies with your mamas.  And on a theater screen the explosion of the wider screen brainstorm scenes may have been impressive. But at home most of the film is puny and windowboxed and it is annoying. I have hung onto my 2000 dvd with the constant aspect ratio and hope that in the future a bigger, better special edition dvd will be released. It should contain two versions: one for the purists and one with a constant widescreen for heathens like me, and it should be chock full of extras including commentary and deleted scenes and a gag reel (Walken must be precious and priceless in those outtakes) and making of documentary. The history of this movie is even more fascinating than the movie itself and there is so much to be explained, from Wood's death to the special effects, etc etc. It's an insult to keep re-releasing this and offer nothing but a change in aspect ratios.Film review: Brainstorm is not a major classic but an underrated early 80s gem with a climax that does disappoint, I'm afraid. Still, the rest of the film is compelling, it's a fascinating premise, and all of the leads are solid. I'm a huge lifelong Christopher Walken fan and he is as always stunning to watch, but I have to be objective and say that he may have been upstaged by Fletcher in this. She may have an Oscar, but she is tragically underrated and deserved another one for this. I first saw her heart attack scene when I was little and never forget it.

552749,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00004VVN9,Brian E. Erland,"[1, 1]","In the tradition of the '68 sci-fi classic '2001 - A Space Odyssey' the '83 film 'Brainstorm' explores the infinite parameters of the universe within and proves once and for all the old axiom, ""the inside is greater than the outside"".Synopsis: Dr. Michael Brace (Christopher Walken) and Dr. Lillian Reynolds (Louise Fletcher) are two scientist on the cutting edge of modern technology who develop instrumentation that has the ability to record human thought, feelings and the all the internal images and experiences that go with them.  Unfortunately just as their research is on the verge of revolutionizing all we know about the mind and the vast, infinite potential within the government steps in and takes over their project in hopes of utilizing their their new discovery for advanced military applications. Will this new technology be used as the ultimate weapon of war or will Michael and Lillian be able to continue their work for the altruistic reasons they originally envisioned?Critique: 'Brainstorm' is a superior film articulating several futuristic concepts that might well await mankind in the not to distant future. That alone makes this film well worth a view. However there are also numerous moments  where the pacing develops far too slowly and the relationships come across as rather bland and emotionless disqualifying this production from ever achieving classic status and the comedic moments of chaos in the lab late in the film are out of place and contrary to the the overall mood and plot of the tale unfolding.Also on the slightly negative side, the overt anger and paranoia displayed against governmental agencies was a little overdone, but I guess that was in keeping with the angst of the sixties. Fortunately the ending really hits home and gives the audience some real food for thought.

552750,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00004VVN9,calvinnme,"[6, 7]","The first half of this film, made when Natalie Wood was still alive, is quite good. The story comes together quite well as the tale of a couple that is in the midst of divorce. The husband, Dr. Anthony Brace, (Christopher Walken) is an employee at a company that does cutting edge  research, and he has been mentored his entire career by Dr. Lillian Reynolds (Louise Fletcher). Brace and his wife (Natalie Wood) have a son together, but their relationship has come apart, and whenever they are together there is nothing but arguing and bitterness. Reynolds and Brace are currently working on a device that allows you to actually feel what someone else is experiencing. One night, while working all alone in the lab, Dr. Reynolds has a massive coronary. Realizing this is the end, she puts on the device, starts the recording session of her experiences, and dies. The rest of the film is a battle for Dr. Reynolds' ""death tapes"" and the use of the recording device. It is after the point of Reynolds' death that the film gets very splintered. It is hard to see just where the film is going because the decision to go on to the end with the film that contained Wood and not start over with another lead actress severely limited the editors in what they had to work with since reshoots of most scenes were now out of the question. Natalie Wood died in the autumn of 1981, and it was almost two years later before the finished product of this film arrived.Some sci-fi type films that are this old are either irrelevant or so laughably outdated that they are pure camp. Because this film focuses on the idea of the possibilities of healing relationships and even getting a new lease on life by experiencing life through the eyes of others rather than the technology, this film has held up pretty well over time. It just makes me wonder how truly great the film could have been if Natalie Wood had lived.",4,Natalie Wood's last movie is a bit uneven,1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,1898,"['first', 'half', 'film', 'made', 'when', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'quite', 'good', 'story', 'together', 'quite', 'well', 'tale', 'couple', 'midst', 'divorce', 'husband', 'Dr.', 'Anthony', 'Brace', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'employee', 'company', 'cutting', 'edge', 'research', 'been', 'mentored', 'entire', 'career', 'Dr.', 'Lillian', 'Reynolds', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'Brace', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'have', 'son', 'together', 'relationship', 'come', 'apart', 'whenever', 'are', 'together', 'nothing', 'arguing', 'bitterness', 'Reynolds', 'Brace', 'are', 'currently', 'working', 'device', 'actually', 'feel', 'what', 'someone', 'else', 'experiencing', 'One', 'night', 'working', 'alone', 'lab', 'Dr.', 'Reynolds', 'massive', 'coronary', 'Realizing', 'end', 'device', 'recording', 'session', 'experiences', 'dies', 'rest', 'film', 'battle', 'Dr.', 'Reynolds', 'death', 'tapes', 'use', 'recording', 'device', 'point', 'Reynolds', 'death', 'film', 'very', 'splintered', 'hard', 'see', 'just', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'decision', 'go', 'end', 'film', 'contained', 'Wood', 'not', 'start', 'lead', 'actress', 'severely', 'limited', 'editors', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'reshoots', 'most', 'scenes', 'were', 'now', 'question', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'died', 'autumn', '1981', 'was', 'almost', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'finished', 'product', 'film', 'arrived.Some', 'sci-fi', 'type', 'films', 'are', 'old', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'so', 'laughably', 'outdated', 'are', 'pure', 'camp', 'film', 'idea', 'possibilities', 'healing', 'relationships', 'even', 'getting', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'experiencing', 'life', 'eyes', 'others', 'rather', 'technology', 'film', 'held', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'time', 'just', 'wonder', 'how', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'had', 'lived']",N/A

That being said, I think the film in more competent hands directorial and scriptural wise would've meant it would've been more widely praised. I remember when this came out people had high hopes for it and it tanked HUGE at the box-office for simple acting and script reasons.  I can see why. The acting was actually pretty bad. I can't blame the actors totally because the director is the one whose supposed to catch issues and give, well, 'direction'.  Not so in this one. In the beginning, the acting was very...fake, from hand gestures, to just really lame script.  There were some other glaring issues, like that Gordon 'scientist' who was CONSTANTLY acting like an ape in heat, and they were acting like, 'no problem', yeah I think not!I think the film had promise, but it should've been relegated to a director and script specialist who understood the nuances of  everyday dialogue and natural 'speak'.  I cringed when one of the gov't imps pointed to his head and said, ""they'll be able to plug right into the ol' noodle.""  Um, really?  Even back in the 80's people didn't talk like that.

Natalie Wood had not finished filming all her scenes before her tragic death, but its hardly noticeable. She had that most incredible, expressive face and director Trumbel chose to hold on that in many key moments. When Walken plays back his memories of her (Wood and Walken's marriage is crumbling), the joy on her face is so real. The music for the film is also amazing...from the haunting opening score to the joyous music that surrounds Walken and Wood on their journey. Fletcher's heart attack, where she records her own death experience, is truly disturbing, and Walken's attempt to play it back (which almost kills him)is also terrifying. A beautiful, brave film.

Natalie Wood's untimely death in 1981 had more of an effect on the finished product than you would think.  The film's release was delayed for reshoots and rewrites and it's good but it could have been better.  Director Douglas Trumbull posits an intriguing idea about the possibilities of sharing another person's feelings and experiences.  When in the right hands the possibilities are wonderful.  When in the wrong hands the whole concept is corrupted and evil is evident.  The problem I have here is Trumbull has evil represented by big corporation and big government.  Cliff Robertson is fine as the face of soulless big business.  Big goverment here, however, is represented by cliched non-descript baddies.  The ending here, too, feels abrupt.  The death experience is represented by a psychedelic lightshow that Kubrick would have rejected in the sixties.  I think it's here that Wood's death probably effected the film.  There's enough here to recommend, though.  The film is eminently watchable and engaging.  The acting on the whole is superb.  Wood at least has a decent vehicle for her final film.  Christopher Walken, eschewing the mannerisms that we have come to know and love, is solid as the scientist trying to protect the purity of his work.  Louise Fletcher probably comes off best as Walken's chainsmoking colleague who takes the malevolent interference of her work a little to much to heart.

552772,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B00004VVN9,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[3, 4]","I've always wanted to see this movie, and I finally did.  Part of the reasons for interest included Chris Walken (I became a fan of his through ""The Dead Zone"", a movie where he played a similar role), and because of its theme.  I noticed this DVD has a suggested pairing with Dreamscape, because they have similar themes, about the ability to enter another's thoughts and the risk of our government abusing it.The movies are different.  Dreamscape deal with people with paranormal abilities that are augmented by the government, while Brainstorm deals with technilogical advances by everyday people.  Dreamscape effectively deals with the moral issues in the setting of a quick paced adventure.  Brainstorm is more cerebal, slow plodding, and attempts to be more focussed on the mental side.I read an editorial review pointing the weakness in the characterizations.  There are little sidebars that attempt to make the characters come alive (the chain smoking of Louise Fletcher's character, the fancy bicycle of Chris Walken's, the classical piano playing of Natalie Wood's), but they lack the depth of emotion as Chris Walken's Johnny Smith of ""The Dead Zone"", which gives you less real concern of the characters.The plot is a little fuzzy as well.  Part of the ending, where the hero thwarts the sinister plans of our government is almost comical in a good way, providing some comic relief, but the final dealing with the characters is confusing and unsatisfying.The sinister government agenda is not clear either.  It shows a misuse but never gets to how it will be misused, not creating a real danger, as opposed as the dangers in other movies of the era that pick on our government (""Blue Thunder"", ""Dreamscape"", and to a much lesser extent ""Firestarter"").  I do find it interesting how often our government is villainized.  True, we have the potential of becoming villainous, but the fact that filmmakers have the freedom to villainize the government shows ours is not as villainous as countries that deny the right to dissent.The special effects are effective; I disagree that they overpower the characters.  The problem, I feel, is in the writing of the characters.  Even with top line actors they are not given the opportunity to shine.",4,A Movie That Deserved To Be Made . . .

It's also somewhat notorious, since Natalie Wood died in 1981 before shooting was completed. This put the film's production in limbo for over two years. Some rewriting, and voice & body doubles were required to eventually complete the film, in 1983.It's generally well-acted and directed, with good (for the 80's) special effects, and a great symphonic music score by the well-known film composer James Horner. It's one of Christopher Walken's better movies, and boasts what just might be Louise Fletcher's best performance ever (She won a Saturn Award for it). Cliff Robertson is also noteworthy, as their government-stooge boss.  Natalie was also posthumously nominated by the Saturn committee-- as best ""supporting actress"", presumably to avoid direct competition with Louise.**Spoiler Alert** plot and ending are discussed ahead. . . .The central concept is quite fascinating, although the plot does get somewhat predictable and implausible toward the end-- especially regarding the all-too-easy ""foiling the bad guys remotely"" sequence near the climax.Most of the criticism I've read about this flick, however, revolves around the apparent lack of romantic chemistry between Walken and Wood. . . a somewhat valid point, though one needs to remember that as the story begins, their characters have just *recently divorced* and are still in the process of selling their house.  Not exactly a situation that would lead one to expect sexy pheromones popping out of the screen.  One might guess that some of the extensive post-production re-writes and re-editing forced by the studio (and Natalie's death) may well have clipped the scenes which made their eventual reconciliation more believable. . . especially since it occurs at about the same time the film's action is getting more exciting.The actual brainscan-replay scenes were filmed in wider resolution than the rest of the film, and were a real cinematic thrill for the time.  Really great to see on a LARGE screen.  And that final death-experience-replay sequence is one of the most conceptual and inspired scenes ever filmed.  It manages to be imaginative, beautiful, spiritual, and uplifting, and yet threatens nobody's religious or agnostic viewpoints (at least the non-myopic ones, anyway). And it also slips in a wee bit of quantum physics speculation, as well.My only real quibble with this film is the idea that these two brilliant people (as they're portrayed) wouldn't have figured out some way to just copy or steal the precious death-sequence tape. . . in order to watch it at their leisure, in hiding, rather than risking discovery and interference by all those nasty government/corporate drones.  And also, of course, there's the silly concept that such an immense amount of audio/video/sensory data could ever be sent over a simple phone line/modem connection, in real-time. . . ah, but well, that's the geek in me, talking.The flick is really quite entertaining.

552777,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00004VVN9,Jeffrey Leach,"[113, 122]","Before virtual reality and before &quot;The Matrix,&quot; there was the 1983 film &quot;Brainstorm.&quot; O.K., this movie may not compare favorably with &quot;The Matrix,&quot; but it does involve some of the same tangential themes that that film deals with. The comparisons with virtual reality are apt, though viewers tend to overlook this aspect of the movie. People usually associate the film, if they even talk about it today, with Natalie Wood. The actress died shortly before the film wrapped in a highly publicized boating accident, thereby cutting short a lengthy film career and giving this motion picture a stigma it still carries today. A viewing of &quot;Brainstorm&quot; shows the film is more than Natalie Wood; it is a compelling story about innovative technology and its potential for misuse by powerful forces. Not a particularly unique movie plot, to be sure, but &quot;Brainstorm&quot; is still an intriguing film largely due to its solid cast and amazing special effects. The movie holds up well twenty years after its conception, which is saying a lot considering how far film effects have come during that time.A team of brilliant scientists headed up by Lillian Reynolds (Louise Fletcher) and Michael Brace (Christopher Walken) have finally made an enormous breakthrough in their research. After years of frustrating tests and wrangles over budgetary concerns, an amazing new virtual reality system has been born. The machines these scientists created can record the sensory perceptions of one human being and replay them for another person. Reynolds and her team can capture everything--sight, taste, touch, hearing, smell, even emotion--and record it on tape. The implications of this discovery should become apparent almost immediately. Communications, entertainment, medicine: every aspect of human endeavor will irrevocably change once this device hits the marketplace. Of course, a few other shadier applications also apply with the device, particularly military systems and mind control. Reynolds, Brace, and Brace's estranged wife Karen soon find themselves at loggerheads with the boss of the company funding the research, the sympathetic yet uncompromising Alex Terson (Cliff Robertson). The United States military leans heavily on Terson concerning the project's development, threatening to remove funding if Reynolds denies the wonks at the Pentagon access to her research.Running throughout these titanic battles about the ethics of a virtual reality system and the increasingly authoritarian tactics taken by the military is the relationship between Michael and Karen Brace. The couple split up over Michael's inability to balance his work with his personal life, a fact that Karen resents since her husband has neglected her and their son. Moreover, there is some sort of vaguely hinted at relationship between Reynolds and Michael Brace, a relationship that should hardly come as a surprise since the two have worked so closely together over the past decade or so. When Lillian Reynolds, a rabid chain smoker, records her death from a massive heart attack as it happens, Brace becomes fascinated with exploring this amazing death sequence caught on tape. The government decides Michael is too unstable to continue working on the project, thus banning him from the building and removing his security clearance from the company computers. When you muck around with a genius, however, you must make sure you have all the angles covered. Brace enlists the help of his tech savvy wife and a few other friends from the company and hacks into the company's mainframe in order to access the tape. What follows is an amazing special effects odyssey of sight and sound as Brace learns what happens when we die. In the process of playing the tape and risking his own life, Michael and Karen heal their problematic relationship.The best elements in &quot;Brainstorm&quot; are the outstanding performances from the cast fused with amazing special effects. Natalie Wood, although somewhat wasted in a smaller role, stops the heart every time she appears on screen with her amazing beauty and solid acting. Christopher Walken does what Christopher Walken does best: act slightly weird by alternating between subdued silence and loud rage. Cliff Robertson and Louise Fletcher both excel in their respective roles, especially Fletcher, who as the temperamental Lillian Reynolds is both believable and amusing. Check out the scene when she dies from her heart attack yet takes the time to attach herself to her wondrous recording device. This is, I think, exactly what a true scientist dedicated to exploring every mystery would do in a similar circumstance. As good a job as the actors do, the special effects sometimes eclipse them. Apparently, the guy in charge of this film worked on Kubrick's &quot;2001,&quot; and boy does it show. The final scenes in &quot;Brainstorm&quot; evoke memories of Keir Dullea's psychedelic trip at the end of &quot;2001,&quot; except here they look better. It would be a great experience to see this film in a movie theater.&quot;Brainstorm&quot; is a beautiful, thought provoking film I never tire of watching. The scenes between Walken and Wood are wonderful, especially when they use the reality device for their own personal explorations. In this way, the movie moves beyond a mere science fiction potboiler into realms of romance and psychological drama. Sadly, the DVD edition lacks the sort of extras a film of this caliber deserves. You would think a film this prescient would inspire the folks at Warner to pull out all the stops for the disc release. Well, anyone remotely familiar with Warner DVDs knows the company couldn't give a darn about what their discs contain. Too bad. I will still watch &quot;Brainstorm&quot; from time to time, but I secretly yearn for a special edition release in the near future--one with a commentary from Fletcher and Walken at the very least, along with some notes about the special effects in the film. If you like sci-fi, this is a must see experience.",5,Marriage counseling through technology,1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,6056,"['virtual', 'reality', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'was', '1983', 'film',

552781,A2KY05T1WHQMCA,B00004VVN9,"Jonathan Golding ""The Librynthian""","[1, 2]","I consider Douglas Trumball's Brainstorm to be a deeply flawed masterpiece. The film's intriguing premise involves the development of a kind of ""mental cam-corder"" which allows you to store another person's experiences for later playback. However, when a researcher dies while wearing the recording unit, it opens the possibility of vicariously undergoing death itself.Christopher Walken and Louise Fletcher play Michael Brace and Lillian Reynolds the driven scientists who create the device. Cliff Robertson prowls around the edges of the story as their oily corporate boss. Natalie Wood, in her final role, is cast as Brace's estranged wife.The first two thirds of the movie are shot in a serious, cool, abstract style which reminded me of Stanley Kubrick or some of David Cronenberg's work. The visuals are appealing and even, on occasion, mesmerizing. The dialogue is spare, fast paced and oblique. There isn't a lot of direct exposition and the effect is a kind of documentary style realism that pulls you into the story. Wood, and Fletcher turn in solid performances and the quirky, deadpan Walken is an actor who is always interesting to watch.If the director had been able to maintain the tone that he set in first section, this might have been a great movie. Unfortunately the last third of the film falls apart completely. There are numerous continuity issues with this section of the film and things that just plain don't make any sense. For instance the Brace's young son is injured, but then this plot point is simply abandoned.However, for me the worst part of this meltdown is that toward the end the film degenerates into a grade B slapstick farce, pulling every bad sight-gag in the book - bumbling security guards, people slipping on ball-bearings and being covered with oodles of foam and so forth. Unfortunately, these zany pie-in-the-face antics are intercut with material about the afterlife in such a way that it's hard to take any of it seriously. It's as if the final section of 2001 had been mixed with scenes from a bad Disney comedy.It is hard to know how much of this deterioration is the result of Natalie Wood's death toward the end of the production. But whatever the reason, the last portion of the film is a jarring uneven mishmash of discordant elements that is ultimately very unsatisfying. This was particularly disappointing to me since I found the first part of the film so enjoyable.I give this movie three stars.",3,A Flawed Masterpeice,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,2453,"['consider', 'Douglas', 'Trumball', 'Brainstorm', 'be', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'development', 'kind', 'mental', 'cam-corder', 'store', 'person', 'experiences', 'later', 'playback', 'However', 'when', 'researcher', 'wearing', 'recording', 'unit', 'possibility', 'vicariously', 'undergoing', 'death', 'itself.Christopher', 'Walken', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'play', 'Michael', 'Brace', 'Lillian', 'Reynolds', 'driven', 'scientists', 'who', 'create', 'device', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'edges', 'story', 'oily', 'corporate', 'boss', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'final', 'role', 'cast', 'Brace', 'estranged', 'wife.The', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'are', 'shot', 'serious', 'cool', 'abstract', 'style', 'reminded', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'work', 'visuals', 'are', 'appealing', 'even', 'occasion', 'mesmerizing', 'dialogue', 'spare', 'fast', 'paced', 'oblique', ""n't"", 'lot', 'direct', 'exposition', 'effect', 'kind', 'documentary', 'style', 'realism', 'story', 'Wood', 'Fletcher', 'turn', 'solid', 'performances', 'quirky', 'deadpan', 'Walken', 'actor', 'who', 'always', 'interesting', 'watch.If', 'director', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'maintain', 'tone', 'set', 'first', 'section', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'apart', 'completely', 'are', 'numerous', 'continuity', 'issues', 'section', 'film', 'things', 'just', 'plain', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'instance', 'Brace', 'young', 'son', 'injured', 'then', 'plot', 'point', 'simply', 'abandoned.However', 'worst', 'part', 'meltdown', 'end', 'film', 'grade', 'B', 'slapstick', 'farce', 'pulling', 'bad', 'sight-gag', 'book', 'bumbling', 'security', 'guards', 'people', 'slipping', 'ball-bearings', 'being', 'covered', 'oodles', 'foam', 'so', 'forth', 'Unfortunately', 'zany', 'pie-in-the-face', 'antics', 'are', 'intercut', 'material', 'afterlife', 'such', 'way', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'final', 'section', '2001', 'had', 'been', 'mixed', 'scenes', 'bad', 'Disney', 'comedy.It', 'hard', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'deterioration', 'result', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'death', 'end', 'production', 'whatever', 'reason', 'last', 'portion', 'film', 'jarring', 'uneven', 'mishmash', 'discordant', 'elements', 'ultimately', 'very', 'unsatisfying', 'was', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'found', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable.I', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

552784,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,B00004VVN9,Keith Mirenberg,"[0, 1]","BRAINSTORM was a good sci-fi film that I saw in the early 80's. Unfortunately, I never saw this movie on a full size theater screen. Overall, I score it at three stars. In my opinion the premise of the movie deserves four stars for originality and the major portion of the film three for competent execution. The conclusion only merits about two stars for not living up to the great premise.I first saw BRAINSTORM on an old VHS tape on a large screen projection TV and really missed seeing it in the theater. The idea that all perceptions (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, reactions and reflexes of the body and emotions of the mind) can be recorded and experienced on multi-track tape is perhaps a bit too ambitious for us to totally suspend our disbelief, but sums up the very original premise of the film. This had me enthralled in the early 80's when I first saw the movie.Some of the wonderful applications tangentially hinted at by BRAINSTORM for this sci-fi technology included: virtual reality, simulation, accelerated learning, verbal and non-verbal communications of feelings and emotions (i.e., seeing through another individuals senses as filtered through their personal feelings), psychological applications, marriage counseling, recording near death and death experiences, and some not so wonderful military applications including intelligence and information gathering, mind control, trauma and torture). The film managed to hint at these many applications by brief visual example while telling its story.When I recently watched BRAINSTORM on a decent quality DVD my overall film experience was not that much better than provided by the original VHS tape. As some fans of the film have already commented, this DVD transfer was not too good and we can only hope that a future release of a better DVD transfer will be available. This DVD did not hold up on a LCD 52"" large screen TV. The overall experience was better on a 23"" to 36"" screen.In my opinion, the most original thoughts of the writer exhibited by visual example included: improving marital relations by conveying how the prior behavior of both individuals was perceived through the eyes and mind of their spouse and how the death experience of an individual (having a fatal heart attack) could be recorded for later playback and study.The first wonderful application was illustrated by Natalie Wood and Christopher Walken who decided to cancel their impending divorce and reunite after experiencing less than five minutes of each others thoughts colored by their emotions and seeing how their own previous behavior appeared through their spouse's eyes. No lengthy marriage counseling, just experiencing a few critical minutes of each others perceptions and thoughts as viewed through their spouse's eyes. A wonderful sci-fi concept and to my knowledge the first time this has ever been suggested in film.The second interesting and curious application explored the mystery of death and was a great sci-fi concept and appears a credible one as long as there is electrical activity within the brain. Complete death means brain death and electrical flat line, at which point there is nothing to record, let alone perceive during playback. Within the film story the unexpected death experience of a brilliant and dedicated lead scientist was recorded for her assistant to receive as her last selfless ""gift"" to science. In order to extend this thought the writer employed the overused story line of the project being taken over by an evil military project after the death of the scientist that prevents the original assistant from playing back the recording left for him.The motives for the government project to deprive him of this experience are never explained. The military just plays the part of the heavy to allow the hero to work hard at eventually beating the system which allows the assistant to experience the recording with little more than the help of his wife and friends. I guess the ending was doomed to failure for being too ambitious, but I couldn't help but hope that I was in for a great film experience. Considering the originality of the premise, who knew the ending would be so weak?The special effects by Douglas Trumbull were good enough for their time, but ultimately disappointing. The performances of Chris Walken, Natalie Wood and Louise Fletcher were also very good. The ending of the movie was a major disappointment, and the story became very silly when depicting the details of how the assistant thwarted the flimsy controls of the government authorities.This film could have been a great movie if directed and thought out by the likes of a Stanley Kubric or Steven Spielberg. In fact, this film might be a good candidate for remake using an infusion of some great thought and state of the art special effects. The limited success of this movie is a consequence of going to press before the creative process of writing a good script was complete. I believe that Hollywood should turn this story over to a talented young writing team and allow them the time needed to dream up a more satisfying ending. The acting talent and technical tools in place for a well funded studio will result in a magnificent work of science fiction cinema and a great sci-fi film experience for future movie

I looked this film up and read about where it almost was not finished. Not due to the death of Natalie Wood, as her main scenes were done, but the studio had issues.

The concept is fascinating.  While the special effects are excellent for a film this old, the most powerful scenes for me were the depictions of a couple on the verge of divorce getting to experience the other's perspective of shared events. The experience of seeing themselves and their behavior though the other's eyes changes their relationship forever.  This aspect of the concept is not played out as fully as it could be.This film is also the last movie of Natalie Wood, who died tragically during the production of the movie.  Christopher Walken is excellent as the lead actor.The ending of the film touches on something so fascinating that they simply couldn't pull it off.

For some reason, they were released in (I think) selected Chucky Cheese's pizza shops.Some friends and I drove 2 hours across Missouri to see Showscan and it was the most realistic picture we had ever seen.Showscan was a 65mm film presented at 60 frames per second (fps). Studies had shown this to be the frame repetition rate at which the brain would integrate the frames seamlessly and accept it as true motion. Most movies are 24 fps, although each frame is shown multiple times to reduce flicker.But you can tell that it's not real. US TV, which operates at 60 fields per second approximates the Showscan presentation. The difference between this and normal films is obvious - most people can tell a video source from a film source. They may not know why the video seems to have more presence, but the frame rate is the answer.Brainstorm was originally produced to use Showscan projectors for the times when people were experiencing ""reality"" with their headsets. This would have clearly stood out from the rest of the film, and would have seemed much more real.Perhaps only Doug T. saw the project in the 24/60 fps version. I know I didn't. However, from my experience with Showscan, I can state without reservation that this would have been one hell of a film as originally conceived. The ""reality"" changes would have more than made up for any other problems with acting or scripting. The ""WOW"" factor would have overridden all other criticism.As for the dialog and acting being a little clunky - well, have you ever seen early stereo or 3D movies? They tended to concentrate on exploring the technology instead of the picture. Perhaps Showscan could have evolved to the state that 3D did with Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder."" Or perhaps not.In any event, this would be an excellent roadshow movie (like the restored version of ""Lawrence of Arabia"") to show what the movie should have been.And perhaps on a future DVD we'll have the helmet versions of reality replaced with 60 fields per second video.

Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood together in a Sci-Fi about experiencing and altering dreams. Even seeing death through the recorded dream state of a person who has died.Just in the past month, Warner Brothers Video has released this film, plus ""Altered States"" (1980), ""Outland"" (1981), ""Coma"" (1978), ""Hard To Kill"" (1990), ""Chariots of Fire"" (1981), ""Frequency"" (2000), and with more to come. And soon we'll see ""The American President"" (1995) and ""Dave"" (1993), and so on.....I recognized that Warner Brothers Videos are suddenly shooting them out because on DVD they were released in those cheaper looking snap cases instead of the standard DVD holder.  So with that in mind, I hope Warner Brothers Video will soon release some of my other earlier classics like Paul Newman's ""The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean"" (1972), ""Westworld"" (1973), Steven King's ""Cat's Eye"" (1985), ""Police Academy"" (1984), Cannonball Run II"" (1984), Cindy Crawford's ""Fair Game"" (1995), The Whole Nine Yards"" (2000), etc.Thank you Warner Brothers.

I have it hooked into a Sony DVD player through composite cables (red, blue, green) and a standard RCA stereo jack hooked into an Technics analog receiver.Now I tell you this, dear reader, because I want you to know from what equipment I am viewing this movie from, and why this new DVD version of, BRAINSTORM, will only work properly on a BIG screen T.V.What they have done is try and give the viewing audience, the original cinema experience with this film, but all that they've really done, is alienate the vast percentage of the viewing public that still haven't found the need to toss out perfectly good video equipment , for the latest LED or Plasma 200"" monitor.I happen to like the look that is achieved on a tube T.V. as it looks more natural and less digital.Luckily for me, I still have the older MGM version of this film on DVD, which is much better because the people at the time, thought about everyone and not just the people with the big screen T.V.'s.I mean really, if I want to watch a movie on the big screen, I'll go to the movies, but for home viewing, a 27"" screen is more then enough.But there in lies the problem with this new DVD, in that about 92% of the picture is letterboxed on all four sides (to preserve the 1.85:1 aspect ratio of the regular parts of the movie) and the other 8% (which represent the ""BRAINSTORM"" effects) is presented at the 2.36:1 ratio that it was shot.  Now, like I said, this works great on a big screen T.V., but on a regular T.V., 92% of the picture is almost reduced in size to a postage stamp (which is quite annoying to watch).What they did with the original DVD was to fill the screen from left to right with the picture at 1.85:1, then it changes only hight wise (top to bottom) during the, ""BRAINSTORM"", segments, but what the new DVD does is keep the same hight through out, but changing the right to left portions of the screen during the 2.36:1 parts, and like I said, this would work at the movies, but on an average T.V. screen, it's not so great, as most of the film plays in a box in the middle of the T.V. screen.So, keep the old MGM version if you have it, and leave the new DVD for the big screen people...",2,ONLY THOSE WITH A BIG SCREEN T.V.

Once the capability of tapping into ""higher brain functions"" is added in, and you can literally jump into someone else's head and play back recordings of what he or she was thinking, feeling, seeing, etc., at the time of the recording, the applications for the project quickly spiral out of control. While Michael Brace uses the system to become close again to Karen Brace, his estranged wife who also works on the project, others start abusing it for intense sexual experiences and other logical but morally questionable purposes. The government tries to kick Michael and Lillian off the project once the vast military potential of the technology is discovered. It soon becomes obvious that the government is interested in more than just missile guidance systems. The lab starts producing mind torture recordings and other psychosis inducing material. When one of the researchers dies and tapes the experience of death, Michael is convinced that he must playback this tape to honor the memory of the researcher and to become enlightened. When another researcher dies during playback the tape is locked away and Michael has to fight against his former colleagues and the government lackeys that now run his lab in order to play back and confront the scariest thing any of us will ever face,  death itself. Despite changing styles in special effects, this is a timeless and beautiful story that transcends the genre and, with Walken, Wood and Fletcher, becomes more than just a story about shiny gold tapes that record brain waves.

Christopher Walken and Louise Fletcher (in one of her finest roles) have perfected a device that records experiences and allows others to relive these experiences as if they are actually happening to them (a plot device that has been so overused now that one has to keep in mind that it was a pretty new concept in 1981).  What follows is a thriller that also passes as a love story (seeing himself through his wife's eyes and experiences, Walken realizes what a selfish husband he has been and undergoes a change).  Of course, the military has other uses for it (essentially blowing things up ... that's what they always want to do in these movies).  And so a game of cat and mouse ensues between the military and the scientists, many spiritual questions are asked and attempts are made to answer them, and a good time is had by the viewing audience.  This movie was directed by Douglas Trumball, who gave us the special effects for Close Encounters and 2001.  On its release, 'Brainstorm' utilized the latest in widescreen technology and therefore was really made to be seen in a state-of-the-art movie theater.  The aspect ratio of the original has been preserved and so the movie goes in and out of widescreen (for times when people are experiencing the recorded sensations) and regular 'boxing.'  I never got to see this on a large screen and regret it, but the disc remains and offers a really terrific movie and a really terrific Louise Fletcher.",5,"A Thoughtful, Exciting Summer Movie From The 80s",1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,1704,"['Admittedly', 'five', 'stars', 'give', ""'Brainstorm"", 'more', 'do', 'love', 'actual', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'even', 'so', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'exciting', 'movies', 'decade', 'perfected', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'one', 'finest', 'roles', 'have', 'perfected', 'device', 'records', 'experiences', 'others', 'relive', 'experiences', 'are', 'actually', 'happening', 'plot', 'device', 'been', 'so', 'overused', 'now', 'one', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'pretty', 'new', 'concept', '1981', 'What', 'thriller', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'seeing', 'wife', 'eyes', 'experiences', 'Walken', 'what', 'selfish', 'husband', 'been', 'change', 'course', 'military', 'other', 'uses', 'essentially', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'what', 'always', 'want', 'do', 'movies', 'so', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'ensues', 'military', 'scientists', 'many', 'spiritual', 'questions', 'are', 'asked', 'attempts', 'are', 'made', 'answer', 'good', 'time', 'had', 'viewing', 'audience', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Douglas', 'Trumball', 'who', 'gave', 'special', 'effects', 'Close', 'Encounters', '2001', 'release', 'utilized', 'latest', 'widescreen', 'technology', 'therefore', 'was', 'really', 'made', 'be', 'seen', 'state-of-the-art', 'movie', 'theater', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'original', 'been', 'preserved', 'so', 'movie', 'widescreen', 'times', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'experiencing', 'recorded', 'sensations', 'regular', ""'boxing"", 'never', 'got', 'see', 'large', 'screen', 'regret', 'disc', 'really', 'terrific', 'movie', 'really', 'terrific', 'Louise', 'Fletcher']",N/A

I bought it and didn't like the presentation from a small screen to a large screen. That distracts from any movie. Natalie looks good and I don't know if she was a c.g.i. (Computerized Generated Image) or not. It stinks and a waste of money trying to redo what was a waste of money after she died. Too corny of a story for today's generation. Maybe if the screen size stayed the same it would have been easier for me to watch. The end is a memory message .....For Natalie.

So sad the way she died. Alas, this movie was ahead of its time. The story line, special effects (wonderful) and the acting were superb.
