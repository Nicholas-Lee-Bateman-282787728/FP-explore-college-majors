Although it's a comedy/horror it's not laugh out loud funny but it has it's moments. The story is pretty good and the effects/makeup of the monsters was great, especially the 7 foot tall zombie!.. to me if you put Blade, Van Helsing, Beetlejuice and Constantine in a blender you'd get Dylan Dog.

I don't if it was marketing, timing of the release or phase of the moon that kept this from being a hit. My wife and I saw it at the theatre (during it's very brief stay) and thought it was one of best genre combinations we'd seen lately, which is hard to pull off when horror is involved (no, this is no &#34;Scary Movie&#34;). In a movie like this you have to have (or seem to have) a bond between at least the lead and his/her sidekick, and this movie did not dissapoint in that respect, nor did Brandon Routh playing a tough detective, complete with his narrative and a side-kick that keeps getting better while the movie goes through it's paces..

It's not that Dylan Dog: Dead of Night is all that bad - it just feels lacking because we're used to more from this genre. More action, more effects, and more of a climax would have made this more comparable to other similarly-themed projects, like the Constantine movie featuring Keanu Reeves, and the Sci Fi-channel's short-lived The Dresden Files. As with those properties' leads, Dylan is a reluctant supernatural detective with connections from a previous life who is dragged into taking on another case. If Brandon Routh as Dylan and Sam Huntington as his assistant , Marcus, seem to have good chemistry together, it's probably in part because this isn't their first time working together. This pair played Clark Kent/Superman and Jimmy Olson in 2006's not-stellar Superman Returns reboot  attempt. It's interesting to see them back together in different roles.

From this description, this is exactly the type of movie I automatically gravitate towards.  Unfortunately, descriptions can be awkwardly inaccurate.  I liked everything about this movie except for Brandon Routh, who I found woefully bland and boring.  Unfortunately, his character dominated this movie start to finish.  (If you can't get past his overly staid performance, you might just like it for the vampires, zombies, and various other critters.)  I quickly found that I couldn't get past his somber approach to everything.  His narration was a bit of a snooze, it only served to slow things down.  There was nothing glib about his vain attempt to appear gritty and hardcore like the PIs of yesteryear.  I've seen rocks with more personality.  His lack of a performance was even more glaring when situated next to scenery chewing over the top performances by everyone else.  The dead may have risen, but his somnambulant walk through certainly didn't.  The filmmakers would have been wiser to devote more screen time to Sam Huntington, the hilarious sidekick.

1440725,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0053WQE6O,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 2]","I'm not familiar with the source material for this so I came to it without any preconceptions. This movie is a shame. Given everything I can't say it could ever have been real good but it could have been so much better.Here's the scoop. Dylan is a private eye, in New Orleans, working on low level, grunt type cases. He's got a go-for, Marcus, who yearns to be a real partner. He gets involved in a case stuck in the middle of a war between Vampires and Werewolves. He was hoping not to work that realm again, but he gets sucked in. Seems there is a stolen relic which, when embedded in a host, will release Belial, a really evil demon who will decimate all mankind.First off: New Orleans has a sense of mystery all it's own. It's a great setting for this type of flick, but not one character speaks with a southern accent. None of the music is of the region and they do nothing to give the viewer the flavor of the area. Not the French Quarter or the homes or the Bayou area. Attending to that alone would have raised the quality of the movie immeasurably. Then there's Dylan himself. He looks like a young Christopher Reeve and that's the problem. He looks too young for the role. And he acts too ""cute."" I felt the part needed way more gravity. His sidekick, Marcus, on the other hand is a hoot. He way outshines Dylan. His lines are better and he really put a stitch in me with his delivery. He makes this movie. Plus....I just didn't believe it. If Vampires, Werewolves and The Undead were that prevalent anywhere we'd all know about it. I couldn't suspend my disbelief. It might have worked in the comic, but it doesn't work here. Surprisingly, a lot of similar movies move along well only to drop the ball on the 5 yard line. This had a really good climax. It was much better than I expected given the rest of the movie.This is not a bad watch. It's fun enough and certain things (Marcus for one) really make it worthwhile.

1440726,A2F1P10GGZ7K2T,B0053WQE6O,Erik1988,"[30, 33]","Not familiar with the comic, I found some background info on the comic on another Amazon review:==============Like a James Bond of the occult--only not as suave or debonair--Dylan Dog manages to get himself in and out of trouble with finesse, while bedding a different lady with each adventure he embarks on. A self-styled ""nightmare investigator,"" he takes on cases that normal PIs won't. Along with his assistant, Felix, a quip-spouting Groucho Marx lookalike, he tracks down some extremely dark persons (and nonpersons) for a somewhat modest fee.Dylan Dog was created by writer Tiziano Sclavi in 1986. Originally published in Italy, the long-running series is set in London, where Dylan works as a supernatural investigator who (against type in a series like this) has a good working relationship with the police. Dylan is a former Scotland Yard investigator, and perhaps the reincarnation of the original Dylan Dog, who died in 1686.Dylan Dog's mysteries have been published off and on over the past two decades, with Sclavi backing off and allowing others to interpret the character. The good-looking investigator has become a true star in Italy's comics publishing, as well as around the world.============This movie deviates from this description:1) Dylan isn't a Casanova, he actually has some past that keeps him pushing women away2) His sidekick looks nothing like Groucho and works for free vs. a fee. He does it more out a friendship for Dylan3) No mention -- that I remember -- about his relation to Scotland Yard. His history and relationship to the undead/monsters is explained very differently in the movie.4) No finesse in the movie...he is a ""tough guy"" instead who is willing to punch or shoot his way through to a solutionThis movie actually starts off in a Dresden Files kind of way. . .1) We have a broke Detective letting himself do work he'd rather not do just to pay the bills2) He relies on ""old"" technology and the like3) He has contacts all throughout the monster/undead community4) A VW bug that isn't reliableThe funniest part of the movie is how his buddy/sidekick has to deal with his. . .uh. . .new condition. He's definitely the comic relief of the movie.Brandon Routh has a great narration voice, just like the old detective movies. He's not required to do a lot of acting though. What would have made him more convincing is if they had made him all scruffy vs. his Superman, clean-shaven look.The makeup job on the werewolves was kinda SyFy channel quality, but considering the movie it all fitsTaye Diggs had the best acting opportunities and he delivered them very well. Great job Taye.There seemed to be something missing with the love interest in the movie...one minute they don't know each other the next its like she's giving him pity sex, because of his situation.

1440729,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0053WQE6O,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Nowadays Dylan Dog, down and out bloke, is more your typical private eye, maybe seedier than most, maybe specializing in tracking straying spouses and taking snapshots of them in the act of straying. But, once upon a time, Dylan Dog was relevant. He was THE paranormal investigator, the one human entrusted by the supernatural community to act as their impartial arbitrator, to examine and probe and poke into things when one of their own crosses the line. But that was some time ago.You're not even aware. Amongst the unwitting normal folks lurk the creatures of the night, blending in, rubbing elbows with us, reigning in their dark impulses, and so surviving. This is especially true in a place like New Orleans, and a wilder neck of the woods you'll be hard put to find. New Orleans invented ""Laissez les bon temps rouler"" and ""Let your inhibitions go."" In N'awlins the monsters effortlessly blend in. And when it's that easy, sometimes a monster slips up. Enough that it shakes Dylan Dog out of his deep doldrums. With some reluctance - but to revenge the savaging of a friend - he takes on a case uptown regarding a girl's murdered father, murdered by a werewolf. Armed with wood- and silver-tipped bullets, Dylan Dog attempts to get to the bottom of things before a war erupts among the werewolf, zombie, and vampire clans, all of whom used to be part of his clientele. Once upon a time, Dylan Dog flashed a business card emblazoned with the jaunty phrase: ""No pulse? No problem."" That's kinda fly.DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT is based on the Italian comic book series by Tiziano Sclavi, and if you've had a chance to read the stories, then it'll strike you that the film is a bit of a departure, in that it doesn't quite hold on to the original source's heightened sense of melancholy and surrealism. But the black humor survives for the most part. DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT, if you must categorize it, falls in the realm of horror comedy, in the same vein as CEMETERY MAN. (And, no wonder, as the central character in CEMETERY MAN was also created by Tiziano Sclavi.)I like this movie, and maybe I should feel guilty about that. But I'm always jonesing for these sorts of pictures. DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT doesn't have the outrageous charm and sheer quotability of, say, ARMY OF DARKNESS, and Brandon Routh certainly doesn't flaunt the iconic appeal of Bruce Campbell. But I thought there were some fantastic touches in DYLAN DOG. I enjoyed the noirish feel and the brisk pace. I appreciated the film's worldbuilding, and Dylan Dog's unique place in it. The film's secret weapon is Sam Huntington whose performance as Dylan's sidekick Marcus serves to lighten the mood. Huntington gets some pretty funny one-liners. The zombie support group sub-plot is damn amusing. I'm rating this film 3.5 out of 5 stars.I wish that the tone were even darker, and I know, I know, this after my mentioning Huntington's funny contributions. I wish that the story had gone for it more, that it didn't feel so much like a television episode. In Dylan Dog's investigations, he learns that a whole bunch of supernatural creatures are moving heaven and earth to locate the Heart of Belial, a mystic cross-shaped artifact which could - and stop me if you've heard this one before - summon a rampaging demon. That plot device is so old it's at the porch and yelling for the kids to get off its lawn.Brandon Routh did a good job, I thought. Physically and in youth, he matched the Dylan Dog in the comics. But I wonder how much better the film would've been if the Dog had been played by someone with a more world-weary air about him. If you'd seen CAST A DEADLY SPELL and WITCH HUNT and Fred Ward as private eye Harry Philip Lovecraft, then I don't need to paint a picture. Fred Ward is about as world-weary as it gets, and I don't mean his gristled, broken-down looks. Still, you know what, I don't want to dump on this film too strenuously. Despite my griping, I'm craving a sequel, and if Brandon Routh reprises his role, so be it. It's not the worst thing in the world. (The worst thing in the world is, of course, KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE... or pretty much anything Uwe Boll has directed.)",4,"""No pulse?

That one was loosely based on the famously popular Italian comic book - ""Dylan Dog"" - even though the story line really didn't follow either the character himself, nor what he normally does. But it was wonderful all the same. So I was excited to find this film, actually titled, ""Dylan Dog."" This one is truer to its base - being a private investigator of the paranormal. Dylan and his sidekick share some funny quips and dialogue while on a quest to stop bad people / monsters, and find a relic. I agree with other reviewers that main actor, Brandon Routh (of ""Superman Returns"" fame) is a bit dry, uninspired, and not quite as humorous in his line deliveries... BUT... he still does and adequate job with the character, and makes him at least somewhat believable. Sam Huntington is fantastic as his sometimes manic sidekick, while Icelandic beauty Anita Briem is very on the mark with her character as the client. Is this a fantastic film? No!

The locations they went to were actually fun, like the Body shop was literally a body shop where they went to buy body parts like human arms. And the zombie support group was also a great addition.

1440738,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0053WQE6O,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Liked it. Would've liked it a lot more had the filmmakers made some effort toward originality - the plot is a very well-worn retread.I recognize that they were working from an established comic book character, thus having to stick to certain creative parameters. However, that doesn't have to mean limiting oneself to a comic book expectation. 'Blade' and 'Captain America' are examples of taking comic book characters and imbuing them with depth and substance. Additionally, there were some poor, but easily correctable, choices made by Director Kevin Munroe - critical changes and easy fixes to the production that would've made this so much better.First, they should've used a North American performer in the key role of Elizabeth. Icelandic actress Anita Briem's accent is blatantly obvious and makes absolutely no sense coming from a daughter of Louisiana. To say her European lilt is distracting and extremely off-putting would be an understatement. Truthfully, even if they had written her character as a transplanted immigrant, she still couldn't carry the role because...Secondly, even though the calendar says Ms. Briem was only 29 when filming began - she looks older. In fact, much older. Much, much older.It wouldn't surprise me in the least if her published/casting call birthdate was fudged by more than few years. Happens all the time in many professions, not just the movie industry. Although selective aging occurs in a much greater percentage within the acting world, much more than anyone wants to admit. Ever wonder why TMZ, so infamous for busting and exposing celebrities, never looks into the real birth dates of so many of their quarry?A younger US or Canadian actress in this role would've made this flick so much more enjoyable.Thirdly, they should've given Routh a different haircut. It's distracting when he essentially looks like Clark Kent - the only other major role he's had in his career. Some actors can get away with it because they have the thespian skill to transform their inner selves, but those artists are few and far between. And Routh, while a capable performer, doesn't have the acting chops to pull it off. The filmmakers needed to play every trick in the book in order to distance themselves from Routh's other films. A high-n-tight would've done wonders, even going bald with a strong padlock combo would've strengthened the character immeasurably.I would've written the whole flick off, but this production had a savior in the form of Dylan's goofy sidekick - Marcus, played by Sam Huntington. Insanely hilarious as the well-meaning schmuck who gets much more than he bargains for when he's unceremonially transformed from eager nice guy into insecure zombie. Dude rescued the movie in my opinion; taking it from the bottom of the dung pile and giving it, no pun intended, a pulse.Glad some actors realize that playing second fiddle can often bring them equal accolade and fame. Too many should-be-character-actors are pushing hard to become leads, only to discover their particular schtick has a limited shelf appeal; often overplaying their overly common credentials. I don't fault an actor reaching for the brass ring, but Hollywood, like humanity as a whole, has a short-term memory. I honestly believe acting classes should include history lessons which focus on performers like Walter Brennan, Elisha Cook Jr., C.Thomas Howell and Michael Ironside. Actors who wound up with a lifetime of paychecks despite taking second chair to the headliners.Overall I found the film entertaining enough. It has that SciFi Weekend filler schtick to it, but that's a compliment. I'm a huge fan of the short-lived series 'The Dresden Files' - and this flick has that kind of vibe.Couple of notes:- It's very odd that so many low-to-middle budget films I've screened recently use older European actresses in roles that are meant to be filled by younger American performers. Strange.- I realize the filmmakers were trying for the old school noir edge - i.e. Voice Over Narration, dark contrasting shots, etc. - but I have to admit at being deeply frustrated that they missed an opportunity for noir coolness: Dog's choice of a Webley .455 didn't include Prideaux speed loaders. C'mon, loaders have been in use since the 1890's, and that's about as old school as it gets.",3,Saved By Sam Huntington,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,4306,"['Liked', 'Would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'lot', 'more', 'had', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'effort', 'originality', 'plot', 'very', 'well-worn', 'retread.I', 'recognize', 'were', 'working', 'established', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'thus', 'having', 'stick', 'certain', 'creative', 'parameters', 'However', ""n't"", 'have', 'mean', 'limiting', 'comic', 'book', 'expectation', 'America', 'are', 'examples', 'taking', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'imbuing', 'depth', 'substance', 'Additionally', 'were', 'poor', 'easily', 'correctable', 'choices', 'made', 'Director', 'Kevin', 'Munroe', 'critical', 'changes', 'easy', 'fixes', 'production', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'so', 'much', 'better.First', 'should', ""'ve"", 'used', 'North', 'American', 'performer', 'key', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'Icelandic', 'actress', 'Anita', 'Briem', 'accent', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'coming', 'daughter', 'Louisiana', 'say', 'European', 'lilt', 'distracting', 'extremely', 'off-putting', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'Truthfully', 'even', 'had', 'written', 'character', 'transplanted', 'immigrant', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'carry', 'role', 'Secondly', 'even', 'calendar', 'Ms.', 'Briem', 'was', 'only', '29', 'when', 'filming', 'began', 'older', 'fact', 'much', 'older', 'Much', 'much', 'older.It', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'least', 'published/casting', 'call', 'birthdate', 'was', 'fudged', 'more', 'few', 'years', 'time', 'many', 'professions', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'industry', 'selective', 'aging', 'occurs', 'much', 'greater', 'percentage', 'acting', 'world', 'much', 'more', 'anyone', 'admit', 'Ever', 'wonder', 'why', 'TMZ', 'so', 'infamous', 'busting', 'exposing', 'celebrities', 'never', 'real', 'birth', 'dates', 'so', 'many', 'quarry', 'A', 'younger', 'US', 'Canadian', 'actress', 'role', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'flick', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable.Thirdly', 'should', ""'ve"", 'given', 'Routh', 'different', 'haircut', 'distracting', 'when', 'essentially', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'only', 'other', 'major', 'role', 'had', 'career', 'actors', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'have', 'thespian', 'skill', 'transform', 'inner', 'selves', 'artists', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Routh', 'capable', 'performer', ""n't"", 'have', 'acting', 'chops', 'pull', 'off', 'filmmakers', 'needed', 'play', 'trick', 'book', 'order', 'distance', 'Routh', 'other', 'films', 'high-n-tight', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'wonders', 'even', 'going', 'bald', 'strong', 'padlock', 'combo', 'would', ""'ve"", 'strengthened', 'character', 'immeasurably.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'written', 'whole', 'flick', 'production', 'had', 'savior', 'form', 'Dylan', 'goofy', 'sidekick', 'Marcus', 'played', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'Insanely', 'hilarious', 'well-meaning', 'schmuck', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'when', 'unceremonially', 'transformed', 'eager', 'nice', 'guy', 'insecure', 'zombie', 'Dude', 'rescued', 'movie', 'opinion', 'taking', 'bottom', 'dung', 'pile', 'giving', 'pun', 'intended', 'pulse.Glad', 'actors', 'realize', 'playing', 'second', 'fiddle', 'can', 'often', 'bring', 'equal', 'accolade', 'fame', 'Too', 'many', 'should-be-character-actors', 'are', 'pushing', 'hard', 'become', 'leads', 'only', 'discover', 'particular', 'schtick', 'limited', 'shelf', 'appeal', 'often', 'overplaying', 'overly', 'common', 'credentials', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actor', 'reaching', 'brass', 'ring', 'Hollywood', 'like', 'humanity', 'whole', 'short-term', 'memory', 'honestly', 'believe', 'acting', 'classes', 'should', 'include', 'history', 'lessons', 'focus', 'performers', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Elisha', 'Cook', 'Jr.', 'C.Thomas', 'Howell', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'Actors', 'who', 'wound', 'up', 'lifetime', 'paychecks', 'taking', 'second', 'chair', 'headliners.Overall', 'found', 'film', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'SciFi', 'Weekend', 'filler', 'schtick', 'compliment', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'short-lived', 'series', ""'The"", 'Dresden', 'Files', 'flick', 'kind', 'vibe.Couple', 'notes', 'very', 'odd', 'so', 'many', 'low-to-middle', 'budget', 'films', ""'ve"", 'screened', 'recently', 'older', 'European', 'actresses', 'roles', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'filled', 'younger', 'American', 'performers', 'Strange.-', 'realize', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'old', 'school', 'noir', 'edge', 'i.e', 'Voice', 'Narration', 'dark', 'contrasting', 'shots', 'etc', 'have', 'admit', 'being', 'deeply', 'frustrated', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'noir', 'coolness', 'Dog', 'choice', 'Webley', '.455', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'Prideaux', 'speed', 'loaders', ""C'mon"", 'loaders', 'have', 'been', 'use', '1890', 'about', 'old', 'school']",Dylan Dog: Dead of Night
1440739,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0053WQE6O,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Movie genres are mixed and match time and time again. Recently they mixed sci fi and the western resulting in COWBOYS & ALIENS. Sci fi was mixed with the samurai film for BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS. So nothing seems unusual when you mix comedy with horror and come up with something surprisingly delightful like DYLAN DOG.Based on the comic book series by the same name, DYLAN DOG tells the tale of a private eye with a past that is slowly revealed as the film progresses. Dylan (Brandon Routh) picks up the usual divorce case here and there and has help from his friend Marcus (Sam Huntington). It takes place in New Orleans, a town twisted in mystery and the occult, both of which come into play throughout the film.The film opens with an apparent murder to which Dylan is called by the victim's daughter, Elizabeth (Anita Briem). When Dylan asks why she called him, she hands him a card and he turns down the job and leaves rather suddenly.When Dylan returns to his office later that night, he finds Marcus dead on the floor, his chest ripped open. Because of this loss, Dylan comes out of retirement from his previous job and starts the hunt for the killer of Elizabeth's father and Marcus, a killer he believes is the same person.As he explains it later, Dylan's original job was as a policeman of sorts for all of the unnatural beings that had gathered in New Orleans, a town well suited for their needs. Vampires, werewolves, ghouls and zombies all live in New Orleans but people tend to just look the other way, knowing inside they're there but never acknowledging them. These creatures of the night have a truce that prevents them from taking on the normal people of the world. When one would step out, Dylan was the man to bring them in. But something happened that made him quit.Fortunately for Dylan, Marcus rises from his slab in the morgue and becomes one of the living dead. Marcus doesn't find this fortunate though and throughout the film tries to deny this fact. Much of the humor in this film comes from Marcus and his situation such as his refusal to eat maggots to survive. Yes it's a gross joke but trust me when I say that in the hands of the group that brought this movie to life it becomes quite funny.Dylan reunites with old friends and foes as he tries to uncover the mystery behind the deaths and why an importer like Elizabeth's father would hold any interest for the creatures he protects. You see Dylan isn't about hunting monsters but about protecting them...unless they defy the truce and take out innocent humans.Meetings with zombies and vampires result with little to go on but a series of clues strung together like the best mysteries written. Each one ends with another clue that moves you further down the line to who is behind it all. And that isn't revealed until the last act.I've never read the comic but word is they've done it justice here. With a limited budget to work with, the writers, director, cast and crew have pulled off a great combination of humor and horror that holds your interest till the end. Better yet, it leaves you wanting more, wishing that this would become a series of films rather than a single effort. The so so reception at the box office doesn't seem to make one think this will happen, but perhaps with an interest in the DVD it will.Routh does a great job here. Many will recall him playing the title character in SUPERMAN RETURNS. Thoughts that he would be saddled with the character alone are tossed aside as he brings a life to Dylan here. The character is confident whether facing down a client's husband or a raging vampire, even if he does get tossed across a room. The words that come out of his mouth evoke the usual tough P.I. genre but his look is far from it. And yet it works.My favorite actor here though is Sam Huntington as Marcus. He truly has the funniest lines in the film. But it's not just the lines but how he delivers them that make them funny as well as the physical aspects he displays here. After watching him you'll first find yourself saying ""I know I've seen this guy before"" and then discover you'll want to search out other movies he has been in.This is not over the top film making with an extensive budget to bring about special effects and more. But it works. And it entertains. And there's not much more a person could hope for in a movie these days.",4,THE RIGHT MIX OF HORROR AND COMEDY,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4355,"['Movie', 'genres', 'are', 'mixed', 'match', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Recently', 'mixed', 'sci', 'fi', 'western', 'resulting', 'COWBOYS', 'ALIENS', 'Sci', 'fi', 'was', 'mixed', 'samurai', 'film', 'BATTLE', 'BEYOND', 'THE', 'STARS', 'So', 'nothing', 'unusual', 'when', 'mix', 'comedy', 'horror', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'surprisingly', 'delightful', 'DYLAN', 'DOG.Based', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'DYLAN', 'DOG', 'tale', 'private', 'eye', 'past', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'film', 'Dylan', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'up', 'usual', 'divorce', 'case', 'here', 'there', 'help', 'friend', 'Marcus', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'place', 'New', 'Orleans', 'town', 'twisted', 'mystery', 'occult', 'come', 'play', 'film.The', 'film', 'apparent', 'murder', 'Dylan', 'called', 'victim', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth', 'Anita', 'Briem', 'When', 'Dylan', 'why', 'called', 'card', 'down', 'job', 'rather', 'suddenly.When', 'Dylan', 'office', 'later', 'night', 'Marcus', 'dead', 'floor', 'chest', 'ripped', 'open', 'loss', 'Dylan', 'retirement', 'previous', 'job', 'hunt', 'killer', 'Elizabeth', 'father', 'Marcus', 'killer', 'same', 'person.As', 'later', 'Dylan', 'original', 'job', 'was', 'policeman', 'sorts', 'unnatural', 'beings', 'had', 'gathered', 'New', 'Orleans', 'town', 'well', 'suited', 'needs', 'Vampires', 'werewolves', 'ghouls', 'zombies', 'live', 'New', 'Orleans', 'people', 'tend', 'just', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'knowing', ""'re"", 'never', 'acknowledging', 'creatures', 'night', 'have', 'truce', 'taking', 'normal', 'people', 'world', 'When', 'one', 'would', 'step', 'out', 'Dylan', 'was', 'man', 'bring', 'something', 'happened', 'made', 'quit.Fortunately', 'Dylan', 'Marcus', 'slab', 'morgue', 'one', 'living', 'dead', 'Marcus', ""n't"", 'find', 'fortunate', 'film', 'tries', 'deny', 'fact', 'Much', 'humor', 'film', 'Marcus', 'situation', 'such', 'refusal', 'eat', 'maggots', 'survive', 'Yes', 'gross', 'joke', 'trust', 'when', 'say', 'hands', 'group', 'brought', 'movie', 'life', 'quite', 'funny.Dylan', 'reunites', 'old', 'friends', 'foes', 'uncover', 'mystery', 'deaths', 'why', 'importer', 'Elizabeth', 'father', 'would', 'hold', 'interest', 'creatures', 'see', 'Dylan', ""n't"", 'hunting', 'monsters', 'protecting', 'defy', 'truce', 'take', 'out', 'innocent', 'humans.Meetings', 'zombies', 'vampires', 'result', 'little', 'go', 'series', 'clues', 'strung', 'together', 'best', 'mysteries', 'written', 'one', 'clue', 'further', 'down', 'line', 'who', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'last', 'act.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'word', ""'ve"", 'done', 'justice', 'here', 'limited', 'budget', 'work', 'writers', 'director', 'cast', 'crew', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'great', 'combination', 'humor', 'horror', 'interest', 'end', 'Better', 'yet', 'wanting', 'more', 'wishing', 'would', 'become', 'series', 'films', 'rather', 'single', 'effort', 'so', 'so', 'reception', 'box', 'office', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'will', 'happen', 'perhaps', 'interest', 'DVD', 'will.Routh', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'Many', 'will', 'recall', 'playing', 'title', 'character', 'SUPERMAN', 'RETURNS', 'Thoughts', 'would', 'be', 'saddled', 'character', 'alone', 'are', 'tossed', 'aside', 'life', 'Dylan', 'here', 'character', 'confident', 'facing', 'down', 'client', 'husband', 'raging', 'vampire', 'even', 'get', 'tossed', 'room', 'words', 'come', 'mouth', 'evoke', 'usual', 'tough', 'P.I', 'genre', 'look', 'far', 'yet', 'favorite', 'actor', 'here', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'Marcus', 'truly', 'funniest', 'lines', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'lines', 'how', 'make', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'aspects', 'here', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'first', 'find', 'saying', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'guy', 'then', 'discover', ""'ll"", 'want', 'search', 'out', 'other', 'movies', 'been', 'in.This', 'not', 'top', 'film', 'making', 'extensive', 'budget', 'bring', 'about', 'special', 'effects', 'more', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'person', 'could', 'hope', 'movie', 'days']",Dylan Dog: Dead of Night

The characters personalities are very likable and they all play their roles very well. One of the biggest reasons this movie works well is that it intentionally doesn't take itself too seriously. Lastly, having a small budget, the movie didnt rely too heavily on special effects. But the few special effects added (see giant zombie and evil demon) were done superb.I would recommend this movie to anyone. Really, its hard not to enjoy this film regardless of age, race, or gender.

You had me at ""braaaaains!"" But for some reason Dylan Dog flew through theaters, which was the first clue that this dog is tired. Spoiler Dogs ahead!Inspired by a comic book with an international fan base, the film version of Dylan Dog is a human intermediary in a world dominated by the World of Darkness-style supernaturals. It's a noir, complete with Dylan's voice narrating, beautiful dames, a haunted past, and a murder to avenge.  Heavy stuff that doesn't necessarily gel well with modern audiences, but like The Dresden Files, the supernatural and noir can mix well together with the right talent and writing.Unfortunately, Dylan Dog (Brandon Routh) has neither.  His lines are lame, and Routh - who looks like Christopher Reeve but lacks his subtle charm - sleepwalks through the role.  And that's ironic, given that his sidekick Marcus (Sam Huntington) ends up becoming a zombie.  Syfy fans might know Huntington as the werewolf Josh from Being Human.  He's essentially in the same role here.  As the comic relief, Marcus easily outshines the grim Dog, who wears just one expression - a pouty glare that Routh also used throughout the Superman movie.The writing is lazy too.  Werewolves are regularly referred to as ""the undead"" right along with vampires and zombies; there's no effort to even explain how all these supernatural creatures work, or why one becomes a particular breed vs. another; and the ironic twist - that monster hunters are the real threat in a monster society bound by rules - is lost in unlikely love interest Elizabeth (Anita Briem). There's some reference to an even meaner monster who, in addition to being pure evil, apparently gobbled most of the CGI budget, but by the time he shows up on screen it's hard to care.In a world stuffed to the fangs with supernatural monsters, Dylan Dog fumbles the only chance to distinguish itself - zombie humor.  Marcus ends up with a dark-skinned arm after losing his original in a fight, but the film completely forgets about this, only to bring it up at the end of the film.

Well you aren't alone, even if the character is a fairly popular Italian comic creation that even partially inspired the cult horror classic Cemetery Man, but I digress.  In Dylan Dog: Dead of Night, Brandon Routh (star of other comic book movies Superman Returns and Scott Pilgrim VS The World) stars as the titular hero, who has a shattered past and finds himself drawn back into the world of paranormal monsters, which include vampires, zombies, and werewolves.  The film's story is all over the place, but despite that it is a pretty fun ride for the most part.  All the other actors involved, Sam Huntington, Peter Storemare, Taye Diggs, and pro wrassler Kurt Angle among others, all play with tongue firmly in cheek, while Routh plays the proceedings a little too seriously given the content here.

1440750,A1TNIJ1OYEJNKR,B0053WQE6O,Nuck Chorris,"[0, 0]","I love this film. Scratch that - I worship this film! Always I have searched the vast film world for that ideal film. A film that comprises many characteristics. The tone's of horror, comedy, mystery, etc. But also, the film which incorporates ghastly creatures: Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies. But a movie can not accomplish such spectacular milestones without being set in that one, truly impeccable setting - New Orleans. So did Dylan Dog hit or miss the mark? Well some say it missed, and some say that it missed. In my opinion, it succeeded in doing what no other film has ever done in the face of our very own colossal universe.A horror-comedy-mystery film set in New Orleans based on an Italian comic book character. That's right. Dylan Dog revolves around a retired ace detective (Brandon Routh) returning to his dangerous duties of paranormal cases within the big easy. In a southern city comprised of ghastly beasts, the title character goes undercover to unfold some unorthodox happenings that have been occurring within the large city of Louisiana. Along starring are: Sam Huntington as Marcus Deckler, a long-time friend and partner of Dog's. Anita Briem as the supporting distressed female client of Dog's that has summoned him to uncover a murder.The story is a good 'ole fashioned mystery-horror type that was completely unpredictable from beginning to end. The pacing seems to be completely maintained throughout the whole film. Never did I feel that the story was dulling down or rushing through itself. The writers of the script absolutely made sure that their product did not travel or linger into unadvised area's. This is bound to have you on the edge of your seat from its inception to conclusion.The acting in this film is flawless. Brandon Routh portrays the main detective with a stern and relentless personality. He completely reassures the audience with his intellectualism and valor when in frightening and thrilling situations. Sam Huntington plays the comedy sidekick, he is not your typical comedy sidekick though. Without spoiling anything, let me just say that there are aspects to his character and personality that separate him from every other existing supporting character in film history. His performance is memorable and hilarious as Marcus Deckler. One which should surely entertain an audience.The setting was a hot topic for many Dylan Dog supporters. Apparently the original comic is set in London, England. This however is situated in New Orleans, Louisiana. Well let me tell all of you Dylan Dog readers out there, there exists no gloomier land on the face of the Earth than New Orleans. Everything from hurricane's to humidity to crime is nothing short of horror-mystery-comedy material. In fact, you would probably have more luck finding a real vampire in New Orleans than Transylvania per se. But how exactly is New Orleans used in Dylan Dog? New Orleans is the heart and soul of this very film. As the main detective wanders from place to place within the Big Easy, you can just feel the atmosphere and the suspense grow while watching it onscreen. It honestly is that astonishing.For a film that is comprised of many scary creatures; the make-up is superb. In lieu of just taking all creativity to the cutting room floor and being over-the-top with CGI, Dylan Dog: Dead of Night stays impervious from the current trends of overdone special effects and sticks with classic make-up strategies most commonly used in fabulous horror films of the '80s. While remaining scary and thorough simultaneously, every creature looks as real as could be and operates in realistic functions. Just further reason why this is a true gem of the twenty-first century.The music in this film is vital, but it also remains incognito for the most part. Never does the composer of the film direct the viewer entirely as to where the film is going, and that is brilliant. I've heard countless times composers of films go all Mozart during post-production. Just showing off their radical crescendo's and losing control of their music's direction in a film. But what Klaus Badelt does here is nothing short of godly. He lets the scenes make their appearance before his music directs them to that scene.The overall execution of the film could not have been done much better. Every component was placed together with very meticulous arrangement. If there was one other film out there in which I could compare overall execution with, it would probably be The Godfather. Although that film was a less good version of this.To inform about the Blu-ray presentation, the image is incredibly transparent. Every last pixel within every last frame was simply flawless. The audio was recorded wonderfully and was mixed and edited by an anonymous maestro. To add a very rare vice, I wish there was a bit more of special features to have been included. Just to get a glimpse of how this immaculate movie was designed, filmed, executed.In the end, Dylan Dog sadly was an ignored gem that failed miserably at the box office. I believe if more were aware of this diamond's release, then a better revenue would have been racked up and a sequel would be in production at this time. A solid horror-comedy film that will never be forgotten. A character borne on the ideals of peace and bravery. Do yourself a favor and purchase this incredible piece of art, you will most definitely not regret it.",5,Probably the greatest movie of all time...,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,5404,"['love',

1440752,AQR22MPF45M3P,B0053WQE6O,Rachel Ford,"[2, 3]","Right before I saw this, I had heard from two people that this was the stupidest movie ever made, and an ""insult to one's intelligence"". Perhaps I am not as intelligent as those other amateur critics, but I loved it.Now, to be clear, this was a very silly movie; but...that's the point! Watching this is not meant to be an exercise in realism, but an enjoyable, silly experience. The whole point of the film is goofiness. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the description makes pretty clear that this is not a movie striving for realism. We have a human liaison between vampires and werewolves, setting out to uncover a monster-murderer. To me, that does not scream ""brain food."" (Although, when you start throwing in the zombies, I probably shouldn't be using the words ""brain"" and ""food"" in the same sentence).With that understanding -- that this is by no means a serious movie -- this is a great film. It is sort of a parody of the old detective films, with an admirable faux darkness and grittiness -- admirable because of how absurd this serious tone is when you're talking about zombies, vampires and werewolves. Add in some of the really clever bits (like the body shop), and you've got yourself a winner!The story (mild spoilers) follows Dylan Dog, the former human-monster-liaison, who is now a small time private eye. When a monster kills an importer of antiquities, and his daughter brings Dylan onto the case, he, his sidekick and the heiress are in for a crazy adventure (complete with zombies, vampires, werewolves and monster hunters) and a wee bit of a mystery. (end spoilers)Now, the CGI and the monsters are not top quality; some of the acting is pretty lousy; and a few of the sets are less than awe inspiring. However, the main actors are all pretty good, and there is nothing offensively bad about any of the weaker points in the film.

Both of those things point to me writing a long, rambling review about how much better European movies are than American movies, especially given that every other movie Soavi has made has been credible at best, but that would be too easy. I'm going to try and ignore the fact that Sclavi wrote the source material for this and judge it by itself. Otherwise, I would hate this so much I would have to attempt to eat the DVD. Which would be difficult since I caught it on Netflix Streaming.This is the place where I'd normally try to put a short plot synopsis, but let's face it: there's not much plot here. There's Dylan Dog (&lt;em>Chuck&lt;/em>'s Brandon Routh) and his annoying sidekick Marcus (&lt;em>Fanboys&lt;/em>' Sam Huntington, trying to act like Shia LaBeouf in &lt;em>Constantine&lt;/em> but coming off more Adam Sandler in... well, anything, really), and there are a lot of vampires. And a love interest in Elizabeth (&lt;em>La Monja&lt;/em>'s Anita Briem, a fine young actress whose manager seems to make very, very bad choices). And... an otherwise pretty decent cast, wasted. Peter Stormare, Taye Diggs, Dan Braverman, Laura Spencer, Kurt Angle (okay, threw that one in to see if you were paying attention). None of them manage to make this good. I'm not as down on it as many people, probably because I've seen very few movies so far actually made in 2011 and so can't call anything the worst of the year yet, but I saw two or three dozen older-but-recent movies last &lt;em>month&lt;/em> worse than this incoherent mess. At least Routh and Briem are very pretty when no one's asking them to actually act--which would be this entire movie. That, however, is not enough reason to put up with Marcus. **",2,"I didn't like it, but I seem to have hated it less than most.",1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,2139,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Dylan', 'Dog', 'Dead', 'Night', 'lt', '>', 'Kevin', 'Munroe', '2011', ""'m"", 'huge', 'enough', 'fan', 'Tiziano', 'Sclavi', 'new', 'eventually', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'break', 'down', 'see', 'lt', '>', 'Dylan', 'Dog', 'Dead', 'Night', 'lt', '>', 'first', 'American-produced', 'piece', 'film', 'based', 'Sclavi', 'work', 'first', 'piece', 'film', 'based', 'stuff', 'Michele', 'Soavi', 'close-to-perfect', 'lt', '>', 'Dellamorte', ""Dell'Amore"", 'lt', '>', '1994', 'things', 'point', 'writing', 'long', 'rambling', 'review', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'European', 'movies', 'are', 'American', 'movies', 'especially', 'given', 'other', 'movie', 'Soavi', 'made', 'been', 'credible', 'best', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'easy', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'ignore', 'fact', 'Sclavi', 'wrote', 'source', 'material', 'judge', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'hate', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'attempt', 'eat', 'DVD', 'Which', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'caught', 'Netflix', 'Streaming.This', 'place', 'where', ""'d"", 'normally', 'try', 'put', 'short', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'let', 'face', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'here', 'Dylan', 'Dog', 'lt', '>', 'Chuck', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'annoying', 'sidekick', 'Marcus', 'lt', '>', 'Fanboys', 'lt', '>', 'Sam', 'Huntington', 'trying', 'act', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'lt', '>', 'Constantine', 'lt', '>', 'coming', 'off', 'more', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'well', 'anything', 'really', 'are', 'lot', 'vampires', 'love', 'interest', 'Elizabeth', 'lt', '>', 'La', 'Monja', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Anita', 'Briem', 'fine', 'young', 'actress', 'manager', 'make', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'choices', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'decent', 'cast', 'wasted', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'Dan', 'Braverman', 'Laura', 'Spencer', 'Kurt', 'Angle', 'okay', 'threw', 'one', 'see', 'were', 'paying', 'attention', 'None', 'manage', 'make', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'down', 'many', 'people', 'probably', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'actually', 'made', '2011', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'anything', 'worst', 'year', 'yet', 'saw', 'two', 'three', 'dozen', 'older-but-recent', 'movies', 'last', 'lt', '>', 'month', 'lt', 'worse', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'least', 'Routh', 'Briem', 'are', 'very', 'pretty', 'when', 'one', 'asking', 'actually', 'act', 'would', 'be', 'entire', 'movie', 'however', 'not', 'enough', 'reason', 'put', 'up', 'Marcus', '**']",Dylan Dog: Dead of Night

Yes, Dylan Dog is an obvious attempt at launching a new film franchise aimed at the teens and tweens who drool over Buffy and the Twilight and Underworld films.  It's not a terrible movie by any means, it's just really not all that great.Dylan is a private eye who acts as a peacekeeper for the warring supernatural beings of New Orleans.  He makes sure their presence never becomes common knowledge, and polices any incidents of violence, as the there is a kind of peace treaty in order.  Werewolves, zombies and vampires live as mafia-type families in various areas of the city.  Dylan is called back into action(he had retired) when a werewolf attacks and kills a human.  Together with the victim's daughter(who you know he's gonna bone), and his partner, Marcus(recently made a zombie), he tries to track down an ancient artifact that will resurrect, Belial, an indestructible juggernaut of destruction!This movie is a Frankenstein stitch job of concepts from practically every horror and horror-comedy you've ever seen.  Violence is rather tame(hence the PG-13 rating), and the comedy aspect is high.  Some of it works, some of it falls flat.  Most of it revolves around the wisecracking(of course) sidekick and his trying to come to terms with being a zombie-His complexion goes to crap, his diet now consists of worms(which he consistently refuses), and he now needs to use household cleaners to combat his rotten stench.  One scene has him and Dylan going to a ""body shop"" where zombies purchase replacement body parts(Marcus gets a replacement arm, but it's black since they were out of caucasian-hardy har har).Taye Diggs is in charge of the vampire clan and owns a dance club where vampire blood is distributed to mortals as a kind of narcotic.  Why does every vampire film anymore have to feature at least one scene in a dance club?  Damn you, Blade!Diggs is the one with plans to resurrect Belial, so he's Dylan's biggest problem.Dylan himself is kind of a bland character.  A kind of pretty boy hard boiled detective who's hair never gets messed up, and always looks ready to shoot for GQ.  He has silver brass knuckles for fighting werewolves and wood tipped bullets for vampires.  He has great lines like when he's punched by a werewolf and responds, ""You hit like a vampire"".  He has a couple of fistfights with an enormous, musclebound hulk of a zombie, and manages to beat the snot out of it.  I know you really have to suspend disbelief for this kind of movie, but watching him beat up this enormous monster is just flat out silly.When Belial shows up, it's a bit of a letdown.  Yeah, he looks cool(kind of a cross between the Alien and ""Darkness"" from the movie Legend), but this guy is supposed to be walking chaos who's laid a path of death and destruction throughout the ages, yet all it takes to kill him is-SPOILER HERE!!!!!!!!-a few slashes in his skin and having him get hit by lightning.  Not as threatening as he looks I guess, but it is rather tricky to get someone to be hit by lightning I suppose.Anyway, it's interesting enough to keep you watching.  Some cool creatures and some legitimate laughs.  But in the end, it's just a watered down version of stuff you've seen done better many times before in many different movies.",3,I'm Assuming The Comic Is Much Better,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,3400,"['hard', 'believe', 'same', 'comic', 'inspired', 'incredible', 'Italian', 'zombie', 'flick', 'Cemetery', 'Man', 'somehow', 'spawned', 'horror', 'film-lite', 'Yes', 'Dylan', 'Dog', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'launching', 'new', 'film', 'franchise', 'aimed', 'teens', 'tweens', 'who', 'drool', 'Buffy', 'Twilight', 'Underworld', 'films', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'means', 'just', 'really', 'not', 'great.Dylan', 'private', 'eye', 'who', 'peacekeeper', 'warring', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'New', 'Orleans', 'sure', 'presence', 'never', 'common', 'knowledge', 'incidents', 'violence', 'kind', 'peace', 'treaty', 'order', 'Werewolves', 'zombies', 'vampires', 'live', 'mafia-type', 'families', 'various', 'areas', 'city', 'Dylan', 'called', 'back', 'action', 'had', 'retired', 'when', 'werewolf', 'attacks', 'human', 'Together', 'victim', 'daughter', 'who', 'know', 'gon', 'bone', 'partner', 'Marcus', 'recently', 'made', 'zombie', 'track', 'down', 'ancient', 'artifact', 'will', 'resurrect', 'Belial', 'indestructible', 'juggernaut', 'destruction', 'movie', 'Frankenstein', 'stitch', 'job', 'concepts', 'practically', 'horror', 'horror-comedy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Violence', 'rather', 'tame', 'hence', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'high', 'flat', 'Most', 'wisecracking', 'course', 'sidekick', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'being', 'zombie-His', 'complexion', 'crap', 'diet', 'now', 'worms', 'consistently', 'now', 'use', 'household', 'cleaners', 'combat', 'rotten', 'stench', 'One', 'scene', 'Dylan', 'going', 'body', 'shop', 'where', 'zombies', 'purchase', 'replacement', 'body', 'parts', 'Marcus', 'replacement', 'arm', 'black', 'were', 'caucasian-hardy', 'har', 'har', '.Taye', 'Diggs', 'charge', 'vampire', 'clan', 'dance', 'club', 'where', 'vampire', 'blood', 'distributed', 'mortals', 'kind', 'narcotic', 'Why', 'vampire', 'film', 'anymore', 'have', 'feature', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'dance', 'club', 'Damn', 'Blade', 'Diggs', 'one', 'plans', 'resurrect', 'Belial', 'Dylan', 'biggest', 'problem.Dylan', 'kind', 'bland', 'character', 'kind', 'pretty', 'boy', 'hard', 'boiled', 'detective', 'who', 'hair', 'never', 'messed', 'up', 'always', 'ready', 'shoot', 'GQ', 'silver', 'brass', 'knuckles', 'fighting', 'werewolves', 'wood', 'tipped', 'bullets', 'vampires', 'great', 'lines', 'when', 'punched', 'werewolf', 'responds', 'hit', 'vampire', 'couple', 'fistfights', 'enormous', 'musclebound', 'hulk', 'zombie', 'beat', 'snot', 'know', 'really', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'kind', 'movie', 'watching', 'beat', 'up', 'enormous', 'monster', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'silly.When', 'Belial', 'up', 'bit', 'letdown', 'Yeah', 'cool', 'kind', 'cross', 'Alien', 'Darkness', 'movie', 'Legend', 'guy', 'supposed', 'be', 'walking', 'chaos', 'who', 'laid', 'path', 'death', 'destruction', 'ages', 'yet', 'kill', 'is-SPOILER', 'HERE', '-a', 'few', 'slashes', 'skin', 'having', 'get', 'hit', 'lightning', 'Not', 'as', 'threatening', 'guess', 'rather', 'tricky', 'get', 'someone', 'be', 'hit', 'lightning', 'suppose.Anyway', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'cool', 'creatures', 'legitimate', 'laughs', 'end', 'just', 'watered', 'down', 'version', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'different', 'movies']",Dylan Dog: Dead of Night

Outside of a few funny moments this sleeping ""dog"" of a movie should have been left to lie (unmade preferably). Save yourself some time and money and forego renting or purchasing this movie.",1,Dylan Dogged it for 90 minutes!,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,604,"['was', 'one', 'worse', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'How', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'keep', 'finding', 'career', 'ending', 'screenplays', 'story', 'Supernatural', 'Private', 'Eye', 'not', 'supernatural', 'opponents', 'are', 'who', 'retirement', 'save', 'world', 'story', 'was', 'pathetic', 'movie', 'jumped', 'place', 'acting', 'was', 'be', 'expected', 'terrible', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'special', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'sleeping', 'dog', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'lie', 'unmade', 'preferably', 'Save', 'time', 'money', 'forego', 'renting', 'purchasing', 'movie']",Dylan Dog: Dead of Night
