It must've done very well in the ratings game despite a sometimes hit & miss broadcast schedule because I'm pretty sure nothing else by Jonathan Shiff has ever made it to NTSC format DVD, not even Ocean Girl. The individual episodes are well written and fun to watch, generally better than American ""teen"" television.I've just made a quick run through for picture quality and DVD content and was pretty well satisfied. The picture is very clear with good color- actually better than my satellite TV reception ever was. If you need/want captioning  (Nick's broadcast had it), you're out of luck, the set doesn't have itThe DVD menu may be better than on the Australian DVDs but I'm just a little bit unhappy with the selection of extras with this package. Also, while nothing is missing as to content, the Australian editions divided each episode into more chapters-if you've got them and made some notes about what chapter to find the best ""bit"" in you're out of luck with episodes apparently divided into just 5 chapters.Every Australian H2O set came out with a few extras such as a photo gallery, character profiles or behind the scenes bits. Here we get only the Season 3 ""Behind the Scenes"" special, better than the one Season 2 has (a version of that one was shown in the U.S.) and ""telemovies"" of each season. The season 1 movie ( these are heavily edited TV movies made of key episode bits from each season) is placed here with the ""Behind the scenes"" specials, (which was apparently shown in Australia just prior to the 3rd season), on one of the 1st season DVDs and seems to be exactly as shown on the Season 2 Australian DVD set. Apparently newly made ""telemovies"", no other set than Australian #2 had one, are the only extras the other Seasons have in this collection.I'd like more chapter divisions in each episode and all of the Australian edition extras, otherwise I find nothing wrong with this DVD set.I've read on Australiantelevision.net that a sequel series, with Lucy Fry of ""Alien Surf Girls"" is in production, maybe we'll get to see that too.",5,Almost better on DVD than on TV,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,2202,"[""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'H2O', 'first', 'came', 'TeenNick', '2008', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'episode', 'collected', 'Australian', 'DVD', 'sets', 'season', 'must', ""'ve"", 'done', 'very', 'well', 'ratings', 'game', 'sometimes', 'hit', 'miss', 'broadcast', 'schedule', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'nothing', 'else', 'Jonathan', 'Shiff', 'ever', 'made', 'NTSC', 'format', 'DVD', 'not', 'even', 'Ocean', 'Girl', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'fun', 'watch', 'generally', 'better', 'American', 'teen', 'television.I', ""'ve"", 'just', 'made', 'quick', 'run', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'content', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'satisfied', 'picture', 'very', 'clear', 'good', 'color-', 'actually', 'better', 'satellite', 'TV', 'reception', 'ever', 'was', 'need/want', 'captioning', 'Nick', 'broadcast', 'had', ""'re"", 'luck', 'set', ""n't"", 'have', 'itThe', 'DVD', 'menu', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'Australian', 'DVDs', ""'m"", 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'unhappy', 'selection', 'extras', 'package', 'Also', 'nothing', 'missing', 'content', 'Australian', 'editions', 'divided', 'episode', 'more', 'chapters-if', ""'ve"", 'got', 'made', 'notes', 'what', 'chapter', 'find', 'best', 'bit', ""'re"", 'luck', 'episodes', 'apparently', 'divided', 'just', '5', 'chapters.Every', 'Australian', 'H2O', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'extras', 'such', 'photo', 'gallery', 'character', 'profiles', 'scenes', 'bits', 'Here', 'get', 'only', 'Season', '3', 'Scenes', 'special', 'better', 'one', 'Season', '2', 'version', 'one', 'was', 'shown', 'U.S.', 'telemovies', 'season', 'season', '1', 'movie', 'are', 'heavily', 'edited', 'TV', 'movies', 'made', 'key', 'episode', 'bits', 'season', 'placed', 'here', 'scenes', 'specials', 'was', 'apparently', 'shown', 'Australia', 'just', 'prior', '3rd', 'season', 'one', '1st', 'season', 'DVDs', 'be', 'exactly', 'shown', 'Season', '2', 'Australian', 'DVD', 'set', 'Apparently', 'newly', 'made', 'telemovies', 'other', 'set', 'Australian', '2', 'had', 'one', 'are', 'only', 'extras', 'other', 'Seasons', 'have', 'collection.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'more', 'chapter', 'divisions', 'episode', 'Australian', 'edition', 'extras', 'otherwise', 'find', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'set.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Australiantelevision.net', 'sequel', 'series', 'Lucy', 'Fry', 'Alien', 'Surf', 'Girls', 'production', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'too']",N/A

However, I will say this was an excellent show to watch on Amazon Prime.The series is about three girls who become mermaids after getting stuck on an island, falling down a hole, swimming in some magical water under a full moon. They have the typical teenage experiences with the added problem of being a mermaid thrown into the mix.They manage to keep this a secret from their parents, their siblings and only one other person knows their secret- a very nice young man who just wants to fish but ends up helping these girls out of many of their troubles.Each girl has a magic power- water levitation (for example) and they are able to use these magic powers often during the course of the shows to help them solve some of their problems.The three girls are likable. One is more of a rule follower, one a rule breaker and one is the peace maker. They learn to get along, solve problems, and generally are growing up in difficult situations.My daughter has enjoyed watching this show. She is 11. I have enjoyed sitting down with her and watching it. While the show might cover some difficult subjects we have not had any awkward ones that we have had to 'talk about' afterwards. There are girl boy romances, but there is not gratuitous sex, inappropriate language, drug use etc that you often see in many shows today.Very enjoyable.",5,Adorable,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,1428,"['watched', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'can', 'not', 'react', 'comments', 'quality', 'dvd', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'excellent', 'show', 'watch', 'Amazon', 'Prime.The', 'series', 'three', 'girls', 'who', 'become', 'mermaids', 'getting', 'stuck', 'island', 'falling', 'down', 'hole', 'swimming', 'magical', 'water', 'full', 'moon', 'have', 'typical', 'teenage', 'experiences', 'added', 'problem', 'being', 'mermaid', 'thrown', 'mix.They', 'manage', 'keep', 'secret', 'parents', 'siblings', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'secret-', 'very', 'nice', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'fish', 'up', 'helping', 'girls', 'many', 'troubles.Each', 'girl', 'magic', 'power-', 'water', 'levitation', 'example', 'are', 'able', 'use', 'magic', 'powers', 'often', 'course', 'shows', 'help', 'solve', 'problems.The', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'likable', 'One', 'more', 'rule', 'follower', 'one', 'rule', 'breaker', 'one', 'peace', 'maker', 'learn', 'get', 'along', 'solve', 'problems', 'generally', 'are', 'growing', 'up', 'difficult', 'situations.My', 'daughter', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'show', '11', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'sitting', 'down', 'watching', 'show', 'might', 'cover', 'difficult', 'subjects', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'awkward', 'ones', 'have', 'had', ""'talk"", 'afterwards', 'are', 'girl', 'boy', 'romances', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'inappropriate', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'etc', 'often', 'see', 'many', 'shows', 'today.Very', 'enjoyable']",N/A

1572017,A41XDR2AM962G,B008NNY9U8,DVD reviewer,"[5, 5]","This Australian-made TV series aimed at teens and `tweens has turned into a worldwide phenomenon, and I can see why. The plots may be as straightforward as you'd expect from a 30-minute comedy-drama, character development is basically a composite profile gained from spending time with these people week after week, and crises tend to be resolved fairly quickly. But there's an addictive quality to H2O: Just Add Water that's hard to pinpoint. When one episode ends, everyone wants to watch another right away. Partly it's because you want to spend time with the characters, but partly it's the narrative arc.These are not stand-alone episodes, but rather a continuing storyline about three Gold Coast teens who end up transformed by an event at Mako Island, so that every time water touches any part of their skin they change into mermaids. It sounds gimmicky, but the mermaid angle really adds a fun level to an otherwise typical teen and family comedy-drama. In this series, as in Lost, there's a mysterious island that holds a secret, and like Bewitched those with powers use them secretly and try to conceal them from others. That leads to both comic situations and also tension over whether they'll be discovered.  And of course there's also a bit of ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Splash."" One mermaid leaves and another replaces her in Season 3, but because the focus shifts and different characters are spotlighted from season to season, it hardly makes a difference. You'd think this show would appeal only to girls, but our son enjoyed it, and so did the adults. A word of warning, though. The show's theme song--""No Ordinary Girl""--is so catchy it's tough to get it out of your head.James PlathFamily Home Theater",4,A great choice for family viewing,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,1720,"['Australian-made', 'TV', 'series', 'aimed', 'teens', 'tweens', 'turned', 'worldwide', 'phenomenon', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'plots', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'straightforward', ""'d"", 'expect', '30-minute', 'comedy-drama', 'character', 'development', 'basically', 'composite', 'profile', 'gained', 'spending', 'time', 'people', 'week', 'week', 'crises', 'tend', 'be', 'resolved', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'addictive', 'quality', 'H2O', 'Just', 'Add', 'Water', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'When', 'one', 'episode', 'everyone', 'watch', 'right', 'away', 'Partly', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'characters', 'partly', 'narrative', 'arc.These', 'are', 'not', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'rather', 'continuing', 'storyline', 'three', 'Gold', 'Coast', 'teens', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'transformed', 'event', 'Mako', 'Island', 'time', 'water', 'touches', 'part', 'skin', 'change', 'mermaids', 'gimmicky', 'mermaid', 'angle', 'really', 'fun', 'level', 'otherwise', 'typical', 'teen', 'family', 'comedy-drama', 'series', 'Lost', 'mysterious', 'island', 'secret', 'Bewitched', 'powers', 'use', 'secretly', 'try', 'conceal', 'others', 'comic', 'situations', 'also', 'tension', ""'ll"", 'be', 'discovered', 'course', 'also', 'bit', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Splash', 'One', 'mermaid', 'Season', '3', 'focus', 'shifts', 'different', 'characters', 'are', 'spotlighted', 'season', 'season', 'hardly', 'difference', ""'d"", 'think', 'show', 'would', 'appeal', 'only', 'girls', 'son', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'did', 'adults', 'word', 'warning', 'though', 'show', 'theme', 'song', 'Ordinary', 'Girl', 'so', 'catchy', 'tough', 'get', 'head.James', 'PlathFamily', 'Home', 'Theater']",N/A

I watched it once and then immediately had to rewatch the whole series. Yes it's about teen-age girls who, at the touch of water turn into mermaids. Their problems are normal to their age, friendships, relationships especially with parents and siblings, with the added complication of hiding their secret. But the girls are so charming that I was hooked. The water scenes, especially with the mermaids, are amazingly beautiful and the tale is arced with a solid ending at the end of each season. I would love to revisit these girls at their present ages, mid-twenties.  If the government got a hold of their secret, I could imagine a mermaid detachment of the Australian Navy.
