It will make him very angry, and you don't want to make a Seal angry.  You see, it's a group of Navy Seals who are chosen to go back in time to rescue an earlier team of soldiers who were unable to return from their virgin time travel mission.  This ""elite"" team doesn't acquit themselves very well, I'm afraid.  A real Navy Seal doesn't get nauseous at the sight of human remains, get all trigger happy when he thinks he sees something, and he sure as heck doesn't turn and run from anyone or anything, even a dinosaur.Michael Gross plays Dr. Frank Reno, an impossibly old scientist who participated in the Philadelphia Experiment and sent a team of time travelers, led by his own brother, all the way back to 70,000,000 B.C. in 1949.  (The only reason the movie is called 100 Million B.C. because it's a knock-off of the film 10,000 BC, and The Asylum likes to play tricks with potential nave viewers.)  Unable to get the team home, he has spent decades perfecting the technology so he can try again.  When some distinctive cave paintings are discovered, he knows both where and when to find the long-lost team.  Off he goes, along with a team of Navy Seals, back to the Cretaceous Period, but their rescue mission is only half of the story.  The trouble with time portals, you see, is that it makes for a two-way street, permitting anything from the other side to make the jump, as well.  I think you can see where this is going.While the CGI effects of the dinosaurs and the destruction they wreak are pretty weak, and the story itself even weaker, I was still entertained by 100 Billion B.C.  The film isn't anywhere near as good as other Asylum monster films such as Mega Piranha or Mega Shark vs. Mega Octopus, but this sort of movie really is The Asylum's bread and butter.  You know to expect middling acting performances by has-been actors such as Greg Evigan, cheap special effects, and an average storyline.  This movie sort of shoots itself in the foot near the end, though, as we get a quick stream of scientific psychobabble to explain some unexpected events that, quite frankly, don't make a lick of sense.  Well, there's also the fact that a flaming red, 60-foot dinosaur is routinely able to sneak up on people - that definitely got my goat, as well.  In the end, though, this movie is all about campy fun and the love many of us share for dumb B-movies.

Answer: When cave markings dated approximately 70 million years old read the words, ""Rita Hayworth"". Yep, that's justification enough for me to warrant a group of soldiers to enter a wormhole led by Michael Gross (considering his experience of wormholes from his ""Tremors"" repertoire, just the man for the job) and be teleported back to prehistoric times in search of the previous group sent 60 years earlier. When the survivors of both troops return back to modern times, they are followed by an unexpected traveller... a very ticked off and hungry tyrannosaurus rex! But, why does this T-Rex look so amateurish, so animated? It makes one speculate dinosaurs even existing... oh wait, that's just atrocious CGI effects that The Asylum production company is notorious for having in their usually lackluster films that, nonetheless, always have some wierd charm about them.

This movie is so terribly bad that I'm seriously thinking of buying it to show at parties, along with another horror special, Hands of Manos, made for probably a little more money--like 35 cents.Filmed in some rocky canyon that's supposed to be premordial forest, the cast doesn't have a chance of saving this truly horrendous bomb. Christopher Atkins is shown several times aiming his trustly bow-and-arrow as he takes aim against a plastic dinosaur. An arrow is certainly the most destructive weapon in the world to kill a roaring dinosaur. and for some reason, the camera always moves closer to Atkins right eye as he prepares to slay the beast--the right eye staying on the screen for several seconds. Does this mean something? Atkins and his right eye?Anyway, whenever the cast members see a monster, they look at it like it's a growling dog--expressing zero fear or horror. In another scene, they're supposedly terrorized by a giant croc. Except you never see the croc. The screen is filled with fangs and red images of some croc from another movie. and then the cast is terrorized again by something roraring off camera. They all stare at something behind the camera--but we never see it.By this time, I had had enough and hit eject. My nightmares are filled with plastic heads of dinosaur being animated by a hidden hand, and then in one scene, you actually see the man beneath the dinosaur head as it bobs around in the air like it's just had a bad overdose of LSD.We need more flicks like this to remind us of the days when Hollywood used to turn out genuine classics--like The thing, Alien, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween.

For me, this was one of those films.Briefly, the film is about a team of Navy Seals from present day that goes on a search and rescue mission back to the Cretaceous to find a group that had been sent there in the 1940's. They arrive, have some rough patches, find the survivors, and bring them back, except that by mistake a giant meat eating dinosaur back with them.Despite some of the dinosaurs being unrealistic and the mediocre special effects, the movie managed to capture, in my opinion, what it must have been like to live in those times. The place was extremely inhospitable to mammalian life, which is why most did not evolve larger than the size of a rat until after the dinosaurs died. To live in the Cretaceous was to be in constant danger, never knowing when one dinosaur or the other was going to come up and snap you into its jaws.Also, most of the actors did an amazing job of making you believe, for example, that they had been trapped in prehistoric times for six years, or showing real emotion in the scenes where they were about to separate from loved ones.

What is written is pretty laughable and silly, but it kicks the plot forward for the army to recruit the best of the best (pffft) to go back in time and preform a rescue mission to bring the lost ones back from the Jurassic period.The first leader of the chosen army to go back for the rescue is one terrible actor indeed, his voice was parody-able, and I instantly laughed and made fun of these scenes thinking they where so lame and over-acted by actors who couldn't act for bleep. This time the scientist (played by Michael Gross ""Family Ties/Tremors 1-4) goes back with the team, and they arrive back in the Jurassic period and right away you will have to laugh at these so-called ""Best of the best"" when a few of them just open fire with their automatics and fire continuously at nothing. If these guys where the ""BEST of the BEST"" they would not fire at anything without seeing a confirmed target and what they are about to shoot, usually with one shot... the army is pretty strict about the cost of bullets, or so I hear, from friends who have been in the army and marines etc.. but anyway...They go back to the Jurassic period and they then find themselves in dangerous territories with some of the WORST CGI dinosaurs I have ever seen. Do you remember back in the late 90's when CGI was still experimental? It's amazing that the CGI in this film is even WORSE then those days, and this a 2008 movie! I have seen better CGI effects done from peoples home movies on Youtube. The scenes of the Rapotor's are shockingly bad, and every-time you see the main big Dinosaur (not sure what it was, but it's not a T-Rex) open it's mouth and scream, it just looks so fake. However, I tried to just ignore this 99 cent graphics department job, and try to follow the plot to see if it was any good.The team end up finding the lost guys, and they go back to 2008 (I presume) and from then on in the whole thing got a but confusing on who the heck is who, as they come back, and things get a bit chaotic when the large T-Rex looking thing comes back with them and breaks out of the facility and into the streets of L.A. From then on in it's what you expect, trying to stop a Dinosaur from going on a rampage in a major city where no one seems to notice a 20 foot dinosaur roaming the town.The end of the movie is a bit stupid, it could have been done better, or explained a bit better as to what the heck just happened, and who was who, and why? I think it was explained, and if I paid more attention to character names, I might have had a better understanding of it, but it wasn't worth my time to backtrack.Overall, it's a low budget action flick with a lot of mistakes to reality, such as a Pterodactyl in the Jurassic period, but if you have never studied Dinosaur timelines, then you wont be bothered by facts.The whole movie is not all that bad, I give it 2 and a half stars, but I have no urge to ever see it ever again. The CGI is horrible, but the plot of time-lines does have some interesting moments, such as ""What would happen if you went back in time, and you where an object appearing in the exact same place as another object?"". I thought the film was a bit of a combination of Timeline (2003), Stargate (1993/or SG1) and of coarse, Jurassic Park. I even rolled my eyes seeing them running from a T-Rex-looking-thing in a four-wheel drive, thinking to myself ""Where have I seen that before?"". If you can look past the horrible CGI effects, the movie is decent, and watchable from start to finish, but it has no replay value to be seen again. Oh, take my word, the image in the cover of this DVD, the Dinosaurs don't come close to looking even half as good as that in the movie.Do not kick yourself if you never see this movie, you haven't missed much. It's definitely far from a must-see, and I can only see this being bought by suckers like me who thought ""Ohh, a Jurassic Park like movie for 2 bucks"" or kids/someone obsessed with Dinosaurs. But even the kid will say, ""My Barney the Dinosaur Video has better CGI then this, Ma""",2,Jurrasic Park goes Star Gate/Time Line,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,4869,"['guess', 'price', 'paid',
