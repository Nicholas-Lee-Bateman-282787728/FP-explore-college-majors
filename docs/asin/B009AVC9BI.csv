Aiken ""social observer""","[20, 24]","This story involves the conflict between two pseudo-religious organizations,one of mostly good guys,Althos, and the Adepts,one of people less inclinded towards ""holiness"",both sides populated with people complete with human emotionalities,desires and goals.Some,on both sides,are utterly souless,evil,if you will. Through a series of torture,cruelity beyond belief in the real world,murder of children by the score,human experimentation in dark and evil-looking institutes,children are ""created"" and raised as Qwasars,people with the special skill of being able to manipulate an element and the training/conditioning to use this skill towards the desired ends of the organaization. Enter Sasha the Martyr,a Russian 13(?)year-old and a Qwasar,the manipulator and user of iron.The setting for this story is a private ""Christian-centric"" school,the St.Mikhaillov Academy in Japan. The two principle stars are Tomo,the overly developed daughter of the previous headmaster who suddenly and mysteriously disappeared,and her adopted sister and ""prince in shining armor"" and the star of the series,Mufuyu.On their way back to the dorm after school,Tomo trips over a person,laying unconscious on the walk.After taking the body to their room they deciede to see if it is a boy or girl,only to have the person suddenly disappear out the windon. Mufuyu gives chase only to discove flames comming from the church. In it she is taken prisoner by a qwasar. Now the story begins.And,you may be well taken aback when you see what transpires.If boobs were puppies this series would look like a jail break from the Gotham City dog pound. A ""serious"" storyline is wrapped nicely around the very well drawn and played characters but,it is all about boobs,""oppie"" as the girls like to call them as they bounce them,squeeze them and suck on them. There is an endless parade of boobs,so much that even a ""knockerholic"" will be left with a hangover.There are 36 episodes already ""on the street"" with a storyline that sets up for more. Nudity is plentiful.There are no Nazies,no Germany in the Middle ages,but there is a ""czarina-in-wanting"" that looks like and is built like a 6th grader that is a serious lesbian sadist.No sex except an scene of Katja,the sadist,forcing her new sex ""slave"" to apparently sodemizing her. This series can be a bit nast as is not for anyone under 17. Very well draw and played  but it is up to the customer if the price is affordable.",5,Qwaser of Stigmata,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,2441,"['story', 'conflict', 'two', 'pseudo-religious', 'organizations', 'one', 'mostly', 'good', 'guys', 'Althos', 'Adepts', 'one', 'people', 'less', 'inclinded', 'towards', 'holiness', 'sides', 'populated', 'people', 'complete', 'human', 'emotionalities', 'desires', 'goals.Some', 'sides', 'are', 'utterly', 'souless', 'evil', 'will', 'series', 'torture', 'cruelity', 'belief', 'real', 'world', 'murder', 'children', 'score', 'human', 'experimentation', 'dark', 'evil-looking', 'institutes', 'children', 'are', 'created', 'raised', 'Qwasars', 'people', 'special', 'skill', 'being', 'able', 'manipulate', 'element', 'training/conditioning', 'use', 'skill', 'desired', 'ends', 'organaization', 'Enter', 'Sasha', 'Martyr', 'Russian', '13', 'year-old', 'Qwasar', 'manipulator', 'user', 'iron.The', 'setting', 'story', 'private', 'Christian-centric', 'school', 'St.Mikhaillov', 'Academy', 'Japan', 'two', 'principle', 'stars', 'are', 'Tomo', 'overly', 'developed', 'daughter', 'previous', 'headmaster', 'who', 'suddenly', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'adopted', 'sister', 'prince', 'shining', 'armor', 'star', 'series', 'Mufuyu.On', 'way', 'back', 'dorm', 'school', 'Tomo', 'person', 'laying', 'unconscious', 'walk.After', 'taking', 'body', 'room', 'deciede', 'see', 'boy', 'girl', 'only', 'have', 'person', 'suddenly', 'disappear', 'out', 'windon', 'Mufuyu', 'only', 'discove', 'flames', 'comming', 'church', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'qwasar', 'Now', 'story', 'begins.And', 'may', 'be', 'well', 'taken', 'aback', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'transpires.If', 'boobs', 'were', 'puppies', 'series', 'would', 'look', 'jail', 'break', 'Gotham', 'City', 'dog', 'pound', 'serious', 'storyline', 'wrapped', 'nicely', 'very', 'well', 'drawn', 'played', 'characters', 'boobs', 'oppie', 'girls', 'call', 'bounce', 'squeeze', 'suck', 'endless', 'parade', 'boobs', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'knockerholic', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'are', '36', 'episodes', 'already', 'street', 'storyline', 'up', 'more', 'Nudity', 'are', 'Nazies', 'Germany', 'Middle', 'ages', 'czarina-in-wanting', 'built', '6th', 'grader', 'serious', 'lesbian', 'sadist.No', 'sex', 'scene', 'Katja', 'sadist', 'forcing', 'new', 'sex', 'slave', 'apparently', 'sodemizing', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'nast', 'not', 'anyone', '17', 'Very', 'well', 'draw', 'played', 'customer', 'price', 'affordable']",Qwaser of Stigmata: Collection 1
1594194,A182VTJIIEVM37,B009AVC9BI,GintaxAlvissforever,"[5, 9]","I'm surprised I'm giving this anime a higher score than Queen's Blade (that has a plot and developed characters despite the fanservice). But before I talk about the fanservice, I want to talk about everything else.When I saw this anime, it looked like a horror/action that revolved around churches. I wasn't wrong but I wasn't expecting the fanservice...and the breast sucking caught me off guard...it really did...The story is very complicated in retrospect but the main plot is this. Two girls from a Japanese Christian school Mayufu and Tomo are first scene being bullied by the entire class. They are outcasts despite the fact that Tomo's father is the one that kind of owns the school (or irony). As they're trying to survive, one day Mayufu comes across a mysterious boy named Sasha. He is a hunter of the the Adepts. He's out for revenge of the Adepts killing his sister and scarring his eye and he'll use any means necessary. When Sasha shows up, the villain gang known as the 12 Adepts start showing up at the school attacking (and molesting) the girls there trying to find the Blade of Maria.What I find ironic is how DARK this series start out as and then it gets light hearted as it goes on...and that's really a turn off. The series opens up with a serial killer killing someone and the blood splatters all over the place similar to Higurashi. Plus, the bullying scene at the beginning hits home because its portrayed realistically in my eyes (some people took the scene out of context and said that the scene looked like a three girl lesbian threesome...which is actually annoying given the topic was very serious in the first episode). Note the bullying does stop when Sasha comes into the lives and stands up to them (in a rather humorous/fanservice way). Also, Katja's introduction is also very dark as she's shown in the opening killing three (?) men after they tried to take her ""mother"" away. There is also another episode on the nun Teresa and the talks about the Yugoslav war and shows really dark scenes. This series isn't afraid to show rape in a horrifying manner (the flashback was not fanservice at all because you couldn't even see any private parts and it's shown from young Teresa's eyes so it adds to to the horror). Alas the anime took out the mention that she's claustrophobic because of what she witnessed.Also, the series isn't afraid to shy away from the yuri/shotacon/lolicon (WHERE'S MY YAOI?!) pairings. Katja is apparently older than what she looks like (12) but I find that hard to believe even with her BDSM streak. Despite the really bad fetish that comes with her, she's one of the more interesting characters not elaborated on in the series given how you rarely hear her thoughts.Which is another thing, the characters are well developed despite the fanservice. I might even add that Mafuyu is a great character that she should be in a series like Durarara because her strong personality doesn't deserve to be in a fanservice anime like this. Sasha might be the Allen Walker of D Gray Man by appearance but his personality is what makes him different. His crush on Mayufu is adorable given its brought up how he won't suck her breasts because he finds her unattractive (AKA her boobs are too small).The artwork and the music (especially the music) are AMAZING. Never have there been so much detail in little things (like boobs).Another thing I think this anime does well is how all the characters (heroes and villains) fight. They all are assigned an element on the periodic table and you really have to know chemistry to understand how the objects work. This is a very amazing concept since I don't know any other anime that uses the periodic table as a weapon list. Like the cool guy Ootori uses sodium as a weapon but if you didn't know that it looks like he's using fire powers (he's based on Roy Mustang BTW).Alas, this anime is not for everyone. Many people are turned off because this anime is infamous for the breast sucking. If you get past that and all the perverted moments...which are a lot...but half of it is fanservice and the other half is very serious you'll be surprised that the plot is very good. I enjoyed the first part of season 1 better given the dark themes.",5,I'm Insane For Loving This Fetishized Anime,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,4228,"[""'m"", 'surprised', ""'m"", 'giving', 'anime', 'higher', 'score', 'Queen', 'Blade', 'plot', 'developed', 'characters', 'fanservice', 'talk', 'fanservice', 'want', 'talk', 'everything', 'else.When', 'saw', 'anime', 'looked', 'horror/action', 'revolved', 'churches', 'was', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'fanservice', 'breast', 'sucking', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'really', 'did', 'story', 'very', 'complicated', 'retrospect', 'main', 'plot', 'Two', 'girls', 'Japanese', 'Christian', 'school', 'Mayufu', 'Tomo', 'are', 'first', 'scene', 'being', 'bullied', 'entire', 'class', 'are', 'outcasts', 'fact', 'Tomo', 'father', 'one', 'kind', 'school', 'irony', ""'re"", 'trying', 'survive', 'one', 'day', 'Mayufu', 'mysterious', 'boy', 'named', 'Sasha', 'hunter', 'Adepts', 'out', 'revenge', 'Adepts', 'killing', 'sister', 'scarring', 'eye', ""'ll"", 'use', 'means', 'necessary', 'When', 'Sasha', 'up', 'villain', 'gang', 'known', '12', 'Adepts', 'start', 'showing', 'up', 'school', 'attacking', 'molesting', 'girls', 'there', 'trying', 'find', 'Blade', 'Maria.What', 'find', 'ironic', 'how', 'DARK', 'series', 'out', 'as', 'then', 'light', 'hearted', 'really', 'turn', 'off', 'series', 'up', 'serial', 'killer', 'killing', 'someone', 'blood', 'splatters', 'place', 'similar', 'Higurashi', 'bullying', 'scene', 'beginning', 'hits', 'home', 'portrayed', 'realistically', 'eyes', 'people', 'took', 'scene', 'context', 'said', 'scene', 'looked', 'three', 'girl', 'lesbian', 'threesome', 'actually', 'annoying', 'given', 'topic', 'was', 'very', 'serious', 'first', 'episode', 'Note', 'bullying', 'stop', 'when', 'Sasha', 'lives', 'up', 'rather', 'humorous/fanservice', 'way', 'Also', 'Katja', 'introduction', 'also', 'very', 'dark', 'shown', 'opening', 'killing', 'three', 'men', 'tried', 'take', 'mother', 'away', 'also', 'episode', 'nun', 'Teresa', 'talks', 'Yugoslav', 'war', 'really', 'dark', 'scenes', 'series', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'show', 'rape', 'horrifying', 'manner', 'flashback', 'was', 'not', 'fanservice', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'private', 'parts', 'shown', 'young', 'Teresa', 'eyes', 'horror', 'anime', 'took', 'out', 'mention', 'claustrophobic', 'what', 'witnessed.Also', 'series', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'shy', 'away', 'yuri/shotacon/lolicon', 'WHERE', 'MY', 'YAOI', 'pairings', 'Katja', 'apparently', 'older', 'what', '12', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'even', 'BDSM', 'streak', 'really', 'bad', 'fetish', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'not', 'elaborated', 'series', 'given', 'how', 'rarely', 'hear', 'thoughts.Which', 'thing', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'fanservice', 'might', 'even', 'add', 'Mafuyu', 'great', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'series', 'Durarara', 'strong', 'personality', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'fanservice', 'anime', 'Sasha', 'might', 'be', 'Allen', 'Walker', 'D', 'Gray', 'Man', 'appearance', 'personality', 'what', 'different', 'crush', 'Mayufu', 'adorable', 'given', 'brought', 'up', 'how', 'wo', ""n't"", 'suck', 'breasts', 'unattractive', 'AKA', 'boobs', 'are', 'too', 'small', '.The', 'artwork', 'music', 'especially', 'music', 'are', 'AMAZING', 'Never', 'have', 'there', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'little', 'things', 'boobs', 'thing', 'think', 'anime', 'well', 'how', 'characters', 'heroes', 'villains', 'fight', 'are', 'assigned', 'element', 'periodic', 'table', 'really', 'have', 'know', 'chemistry', 'understand', 'how', 'objects', 'work', 'very', 'amazing', 'concept', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'anime', 'periodic', 'table', 'weapon', 'list', 'cool', 'guy', 'Ootori', 'sodium', 'weapon', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'using', 'fire', 'powers', 'based', 'Roy', 'Mustang', 'BTW', '.Alas', 'anime', 'not', 'everyone', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'turned', 'off', 'anime', 'infamous', 'breast', 'sucking', 'get', 'past', 'perverted', 'moments', 'are', 'lot', 'half', 'fanservice', 'other', 'half', 'very', 'serious', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'plot', 'very', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'part', 'season', '1', 'better', 'given', 'dark', 'themes']",Qwaser of Stigmata: Collection 1
