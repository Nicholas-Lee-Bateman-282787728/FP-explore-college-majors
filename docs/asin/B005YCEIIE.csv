And, of course, will he come through for her, and will she forgive him; will she find herself and forgive her father?  And herself?Yes, and that's fine.  The country setting, filming, hip music, and actors are all nice.  The story's a bit flat and not as amusing as they want it to be.  It's PG-13, and there's a fair amount of sexual references or innuendo.  It dulls the romance.  For example, in one scene, the heroine inadvertantly meets the hero in a small grocery store, and seeing condoms in his shopping basket offers to pay for them since he paid for her gas when her credit card wouldn't work.  I guess that could be funny.  He's a virile male; she gives him her phone number, and they have a good laugh.  Ugh.  I think they needed a woman on the screenplay.Overall, it offers sentiment consistent with a potentially good but flawed, romantic comedy: love conquers all, some quirky but mostly fun characters, beautiful scenery.
