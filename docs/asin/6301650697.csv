260039,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,6301650697,Draconis Blackthorne,"[1, 1]","PLOTThe film begins with the excitement of a new college semester on the verge - Kate, Daniel, and Jay-Jay travel to school with their seemingly 'normal' stereotypical families'... then there's Robbie, a sensitive sort with an alcoholic mother and verbally abusive father, trying to align his priorities despite his past extreme distractions with a fantasy board game akin to ""Dungeons & Dragons"" called ""Mazes & Monsters"", when lo and behold, he spies an ""M&M;"" group advertised on the posting board in the cafeteria... and it begins... the obsession resurfaces, progressing from a gloomy candlelit room to ""taking it to the next level"" wherein the players actually don the accoutrement of their characters {acquired from Theatre class} and travel to the local caverns where Jay-Jay, the resident ""Game Lord"" {eq. 'Dungeon Master'; D&D;} has arranged several objects including a skeleton which appear on cue when the wayfarers pass through certain spots in the caves, whereupon the Game Lord's voice echoes forth with warnings and instructions. This is where the hallucinations begin for Robbie, imagining a literal ""Gorvil"" creature stalking the stalactite-laden corridors, which becomes the first indication of his mental degeneration.He confides in his girlfriend Kate about the loss of his brother 'Hall' on Halloween to a mysterious dissappearence and was never found...Thus, on Halloween night, while others were living it up, he sleeps and begins dreaming of a dark figure named ""The Great Hall"" who informs him of his erstwhile 'destiny' as 'Pardu' the Holy Man, who must seperate himself from the group, become {ack!} celebate {there went Kate...}, and seek 'The Towers' by engaging upon a quest, which takes Robbie to New York City where he roams in a hypnogogic state until an attempted mugging by a couple of greasy thugs results in him defending himself by stabbing one of the lowlifes, all the while perceiving himself as this 'Pardu', and the attacker as another Gorvil.Frightened by this encounter, he almost comes to his senses and calls for help. Being skiddish however, seeing another couple of guys on a street corner scares him enough to descend into the city's subway system and further below into the labyrinthine underworld beneath the streets, and its roaring ""Great Dragon""...Meanwhile, the Police become alerted to his sudden disappearence, and the group are payed a visit by an investigator. Scared that they may be implicated in his missing, his friends scramble to figure out where he may have gone by inspecting his room and find a hand-drawn map, carefully brainstorming to decipher his 'journey'.Robbie eventually encounters a homeless man who jestingly refers to himself as 'The King of France' - of course, being in a completely delusional state of mind, ""Pardu"" acknowledges him as such, inquiring for directions to 'The Towers'*, which turns out being 'The Twin Towers', The World Trade Center, to be exact, which one could see coming from a mile away, as it were, both figuratively and literally. Included is some extensive interior footage of the WTC from lobby to observation deck.His friends eventually catch up to him as he climbs out on the parapet preparing to join with ""The Great Hall"", until tearfully awakening from the somnambulism. He is eventually committed to a scenic mental home where his delusions persist, and after one last 'adventure' with friends, is left to live out his days in his fantasy world.ANALYSISObviously, Robbie dealt with the loss of his big brother by anthropomorphosizing his memory as ""The Great Hall"", and his desire to reunite with him. Delving into the board game as a form of escapism taken to an extreme, in this case served as an affectation of his mental illness, but may not necessarily have been the cause of it, but merely placed fantastical definitions and terminology to establish an albeit false identity.Through a balanced perspective, these games can be an amusing recreational activity, but there may always be the danger of those with a wayward brain who will literalize elements therein and attempt to detrimentally personafy either the characters and/or activities described. While the exercise of the imagination is encouraged and channelled into creative endeavors, care must sometimes be taken with the mentally ill in order to prevent compulsion, lest you travel the ""Pardu Path"" to insanity.__________________* 'The Towers' as part of the legend of 'The Lord of The Rings' series writ by sage Tolkien were acknowledged as one of the possible motivations while the group were inspecting a map and gathering clues to his whereabouts, defining his mentality by the persona of the Pardu character.

260040,A1PGYLW8L6KAD9,6301650697,EdgeRunner,"[8, 10]","In yet another misguided attempt to save the nation's youth from ""things we don't understand but they sure LOOK like trouble,"" the socially-conscious television executives of the 80's gave us the anti-RPG diatribe ""Mazes and Monsters."" It's just a shame we couldn't do something of equal value for them in return, like force them to do several hundred push-ups in a tub filled with rotting fish heads and rusty thumbtacks. I bear them no malice because the film was bad (which it most certainly was), but because the theme song was so wretchedly, painfully horrible, after enduring it for just a few brief seconds, the idea of getting a triple root canal on a moving rollercoaster sounds fairly soothing in comparison. I'm still bitter just thinking about it.Still, disregarding that steaming pile of musical waste product posing as the opening tune (which is replayed off and on throughout the film, I'm sorry to say), there are a few things you could actually recommend this film for. The dialogue, acting, and overall 'story' are terrible enough to generate more laughs than most of the intentional 'comedies' currently playing nowadays, and there's a couple hallucination sequences that feature a surprisingly well-designed creature costume, far better than a [bad] production like this deserved. Be warned, though: the film plods along at a stubbornly slow pace, and most viewers may find their 'fast forward' button has become their new best pal long before the ending credits roll (and since that lousy theme song plays again during those credits, you may want to nominate the 'mute' button as your second best pal).Final vote? Don't buy this film. Talk a friend into buying it, borrow their copy, then breathe a sigh of relief that it won't be taking up space on YOUR shelf.

260042,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,6301650697,"Mark Savary ""moon_city""","[7, 8]","In the late 1970's and early 1980's, a popular game came along that scared the bejeezus out of the older generation.What initially appeared like a harmless game based on knights and dragons and other such fantasy figures from youth, proved to be not quite as sweet and innocent as parents previously thought. Mom and Dad found out that the game was (potentially) full of violence. Concerns grew that the game took long periods of time to play, and had occult/magic elements. Overzealous or simply ignorant adults blasted the game, fearing what exposure to these &quot;fantasy plays&quot; would do to their innocent little children.Parents have traditionally feared such things; in the mid part of the century, it was E.C's horror comics, then rock n' roll, then the Beatles. We see such similar and mostly unfounded fears today over card games like &quot;Magic: The Gathering,&quot; and even more so over video games. Fearful parents always point to the occasional isolated news article about some guy who freaked out after several straight days of gameplay on &quot;Everquest&quot; (&quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; instantly sprang to mind when this was reported), as some kind of proof that such games are bad for EVERYONE.&quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; is the embodiment of the fear of overprotective parents in the early 1980's, who were worried about RPGs. In the made-for-TV film, a young man becomes so wrapped up in gameplay, that he loses his sense of self and &quot;becomes&quot; his character. The game itself is a very thinly veiled version of Dungeons and Dragons, and anyone even remotely familiar with the game will instantly see the allusions to D &amp; D.While I have never been a big fan of Tom Hanks, I freely admit the man is quite talented. Even at a young age, and at a relatively early stage in his career, he still commands the film with his portrayal of the troubled young man, Robbie. The ending is especially well-handled, memorable, and poignant.Also interesting is that, although the film is clearly a warning against role-playing games, the message is somewhat mixed. While Robbie has problems divorcing himself from the gameworld, the other kids do not. In fact, they are incredibly intelligent, and prove this by deducing what is happening to their friend, and how best to help him. In addition, the kids are a far cry from being the sort of unpopular, nerdy, Star Trek virgins that gamers are usually portrayed as in the movies.I would encourage you to try this film, although I think you should avoid the Front Row Video brand version that I purchased, as it was dubbed very poorly in EP mode. &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; will take you back to the time at the dawn of the 80's when D &amp; D and the books of J.R.R. Tolkien were all the rage. Ah, nostagia.The film is not only important as an artifact of the time in which it was made, it also showcases a recently lost New York landmark. And better still, the film is pretty good in its own right.",4,Your Parents' View of D &amp; D...,1030492800,"08 28, 2002",2002,2984,"['late', '1970', 'early', '1980', 'popular', 'game', 'came', 'along', 'that', 'scared', 'bejeezus', 'older', 'initially', 'appeared', 'harmless', 'game', 'based', 'knights', 'dragons', 'other', 'such', 'fantasy', 'figures', 'youth', 'proved', 'be', 'not', 'quite', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'parents', 'previously', 'thought', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'found', 'out', 'game', 'was', 'potentially', 'full', 'violence', 'Concerns', 'grew', 'game', 'took', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'play', 'had', 'occult/magic', 'elements', 'Overzealous', 'simply', 'ignorant', 'adults', 'blasted', 'game', 'fearing', 'what', 'exposure', 'quot', 'quot', 'would', 'do', 'innocent', 'little', 'children.Parents', 'have', 'traditionally', 'feared', 'such', 'things', 'mid', 'part', 'century', 'was', 'E.C', 'horror', 'comics', 'then', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'then', 'Beatles', 'see', 'such', 'similar', 'mostly', 'unfounded', 'fears', 'today', 'card', 'games', 'quot', 'Magic', 'Gathering', 'quot', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'video', 'games', 'Fearful', 'parents', 'always', 'point', 'occasional', 'isolated', 'news', 'article', 'guy', 'who', 'freaked', 'out', 'several', 'straight', 'days', 'gameplay', 'quot', 'Everquest', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mazes', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'instantly', 'mind', 'when', 'was', 'reported', 'kind', 'proof', 'such', 'games', 'are', 'bad', 'EVERYONE.', 'quot', 'Mazes', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'embodiment', 'fear', 'overprotective', 'parents', 'early', '1980', 'who', 'were', 'worried', 'RPGs', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'gameplay', 'sense', 'self', 'quot', 'quot', 'character', 'game', 'very', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'version', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'familiar', 'game', 'will', 'instantly', 'see', 'allusions', 'D', 'amp', 'D.While', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'freely', 'admit', 'man', 'quite', 'talented', 'Even', 'young', 'age', 'relatively', 'early', 'stage', 'career', 'still', 'film', 'portrayal', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'Robbie', 'ending', 'especially', 'well-handled', 'memorable', 'poignant.Also', 'interesting', 'film', 'clearly', 'warning', 'role-playing', 'games', 'message', 'somewhat', 'mixed', 'Robbie', 'problems', 'divorcing', 'gameworld', 'other', 'kids', 'do', 'not', 'fact', 'are', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'prove', 'deducing', 'what', 'happening', 'friend', 'how', 'best', 'help', 'addition', 'kids', 'are', 'far', 'cry', 'being', 'sort', 'unpopular', 'nerdy', 'Star', 'Trek', 'gamers', 'are', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'movies.I', 'would', 'encourage', 'try', 'film', 'think', 'should', 'avoid', 'Front', 'Row', 'Video', 'brand', 'version', 'purchased', 'was', 'dubbed', 'very', 'poorly', 'EP', 'mode', 'quot', 'Mazes', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'will', 'take', 'back', 'time', 'dawn', '80', 'when', 'D', 'amp', 'D', 'books', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'were', 'rage', 'Ah', 'nostagia.The', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'important', 'artifact', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'also', 'recently', 'lost', 'New', 'York', 'landmark', 'better', 'still', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'own', 'right']",Rona Jaffe's Mazes & Monsters VHS

260044,A2OP21WUY8L3WL,6301650697,Robert Meeks,"[8, 10]","'Mazes and Monsters' was a made for TV movie broadcast in the Fall of 1982. This movie featured Tom Hanks out of his 'Bossom Buddies' attire and instead donning a robe. A good number of role-players I know hate this movie; interestingly enough, most of them have never seen it. There is an interesting hypocrisy here: many of them whine at being labelled and misunderstood by people who do not know them, and yet, they turn right around and do the same. Hence, there are also several misconceptions about this movie both from people who never watched it or those who watched it with a closed mind. 'Mazes and Monsters' is based on the book of the same name by Rona Jaffe. This is the story of four college students who come to know each other by answering a players wanted flyer posted on a bulletin board for the game Mazes and Monsters. The students, as many people do, have varying degrees of issues in their lives and/or do not socialize well. This is not by any means represented as a definition of gamers but rather as a reason people look for activity and for some escape; for these particular students, they chose gaming. This additionally adds character development into the story so the characters themselves are not one dimensional. One of the students, played by Tom Hanks, has had a breakdown before and is pleaded with by his mother not to get involved with that game again; addictions are hard to break. As the gamers get further into the game, such as playing the game in a maze of caves, one of them, the Tom Hanks character, begins to find it difficult to seperate fantasy from reality as his worlds are melding. As his behavior deepens and he further isolates himself from his friends, he becomes drawn further into this world his own mind has created. This leads to his disappearance and his friends and the police, together and seperately, trying to find him before something really bad happens. One of the major complaints lodged against this movie is that it is anti-roleplaying. This story was directly influenced by events involving roleplayers which made local and national headlines at the time. It is never represented in this movie that the game itself was the culprit but rather the degree of escapism with regard to someone who has difficulty seperating fantasy and reality. In other words, the game did not drive someone crazy, they used the game as an escape from reality which, due to their lack of stability, went too far. This is further punctuated by the use of a newscast in the movie which uses the game as fodder for the disappearance, although, we have seen through the events which have transpired and through his friends that it is his stability, or lack thereof, which has led to this. This same type of escapism could just as well be applied to someone who loses themselves in the world of a TV show, a movie, or a series of books. Rather than condemn its subject, as many who have never seen this movie claim it did, it seeks to propose a scenario of how someones instability and tendency to excess when combined with an obsessive activity could possibly lead to such behavior. This movie sought understanding not blame, which is further punctuated by the very last scene of the movie when the four friends are together again. Those who condemned this movie only sought blame for their lack of understanding. Since this was a made for TV movie, this may move a little slower than that with which a lot of todays movie viewers are comfortable.
