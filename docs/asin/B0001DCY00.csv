So too, does Rosamund John reveal Diana Mitchell with the serenity and loveliness so associated with the enduring English Rose of the day.The film traces the evolution of the Spitfire from the sleek Schneider Trophy racing float plane days designed by Mitchell at Supermarine to his determination to build a ""bird that spits fire"" to spare Britain the destruction suffered by Spanish cities from Nazi bombers.Mitch and Geoff's holiday to Nazi Germany is the turning point of the film. At a dinner, at which they are the guests of honour, Germany officers tell them with icy charm of the ""new Germany's"" intention to become overlords by force of arms.At after dinner drinks Mitch is cordually introducted  to ""a compeditor of his"" Dr. Willy Messerschmitt.

800813,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0001DCY00,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Spitfire, 1942 filmThis is the story of R. J. Mitchell, the British Engineer who designed the Spitfire pursuit airplane that won the Battle of Britain in 1940 [with help from radar and code-breakers]. The rise of Nazi Germany led to war and conquest of its neighbors. Can Britain survive? The enemy raid is tracked on the ground and fighters are launched to shoot them down. [It takes an armed defender to stop an armed attacker.] Rearmed and refueled fighters are sent up with fresh pilots. An officer tells about the ""wizard"" who designed the Spitfire. Mitchell studied seagulls and how their wings worked while working for Supermarine Aviation (they made flying boats). You see a one-engine biplane with floats. One day a visitor arrives to talk to Mitchell, he is a test pilot who is unemployed (the year is 1924). Mitchell has a new design for an airplane. ""This is the future."" The Board of Directors wants to stick with the old design. [If its not broke don't fix it.]Mitchell returns home to talk to his wife Diana. Commander Gray telephones. We see a model. [Note the thin wings.] There is a race in 1923 Baltimore. When the Supermarine flies fastest its pilot blacks out! There is another contest in 1927 Venice. Others have copied Mitchell's design (low wing monoplane). They fly laps to win by the highest speed. Vickers buys out Supermarine to acquire its talent. ""We understand one another."" There is another contest in 1929. Vickers wants 100,000 from the Government to support their aircraft experiments. There's no money in the budget. A man delivers a check from a wealthy woman in 1931. This allows winning the Schneider Trophy permanently. Mitchell is invited on a trip to Germany. They watch gliders perform, men in uniforms march, and ""peace-loving people"". They meet Dr. Messerschmitt who offers a job to Mitchell. ""The Versailles Treaty is dead."" ""Oh, I see."" ""History is only important when it is being made."" Now or the future is important.Hitler's coming to power is important. A united people will prevail, ""guns always have the last word"". ""But England is our friend and not be alarmed."" One man laughs at this. Did he have too much to drink? Diana met a charming man. Back in Britain Mitchell warns about those German bombers. Those who favor ""Peace"" are in power. Mitchell wants to design the best fighter now. Some at the Air Ministry agree to this design project. This will require a new engine. ""Who is going to pay for this?"" This designer has an idea for a new engine, the Merlin (to work wonders). Mitchell is now working hard (and has a health problem). He talks about his design for a new fighter. Mitchell's doctor tells him to take a vacation for his health. Or else he may not live past eight months! His design is improved but must be done in twelve months.Mitchell continues with his work, development goes on. He is more important than the future. Or take a vacation now? The newspaper reports ""German Bombers Wipe Out Spanish Town"". In time the new Spitfire does its test flight. It is a badly needed product. There's little time left. The Government will build hundreds! Mitchell is happy now, at last. Nest we see bombers off Beachy Head. Spitfires attack. German escort fighters are also there. Bombers are shot down.It is ironic that R. J. Mitchell was played by Leslie Howard as he soon perished in the war. Early Spitfires used a carburetor instead of fuel injection and could stall when flying in a loop upside down. There was no mention of the earlier Hawker Hurricane which was also important in the early days. The 1960 movie ""Battle of Britain"" provides another drama about 1940.

800822,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0001DCY00,Dr. James Gardner,"[9, 10]","In the summer and early fall of 1940 when the Nazis were bombing London in hopes of convincing the British to surrender, in what we now call ""The Battle of Britain"", the small but determined RAF valiantly fought off the German armada, inflicting such heavy tolls on the Nazi bombers and fighter planes that Hitler eventually called off the assault. On August 20, 1940 Churchill in a speech to the House of Commons said ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed to so few"", and it is those ""few"" to whom the film ""The First of the Few"" refers.One of the keys to the RAF's success was the ""Supermarine Spitfire"", a short range, single engine fighter, nicknamed an ""interceptor"", that plane-for-plane inflicted more casualties on the Nazi than any other Allied plane, and had the lowest attrition rate. The Spitfire was so effective it continued to be used into the 1950s. It could fly over 200 miles, climb to 30,000 feet, cruise at 350+ mph, and dive at 500+ mph. It carried 8 machine guns in the wings. Goering once asked his Luftwaffe pilots what they needed and they said simply - ""Spitfires."" Eventually more than 20,000 would be made. This film is the story of R. J. Mitchell (1895-1937), the man who designed the plane.The film was produced and directed by Leslie Howard (1893-1943) who played Mitchell. In his brief career and 34 films Howard was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Berkeley Square"" and ""Pygmalion"") and gave us memorable performances in ""The Petrified Forest"" (1936) and ""GWTW"" (1939). He started in films in the U.K. in 1914, and then enlisted in WW 1 in the British Army where he suffered from shell shock and was advised to take up acting as a form of therapy. His big breakthrough came in 1933 with ""Berkeley Square"".Howard, a Hungarian Jew,  had emigrated to the U.S. from Britain in the 30s where he became an A list movie star, but when the war broke out he returned to Britain and offered to re-enlist in the Army. He was convinced he could do more good as an actor and spent the rest of his life working on propaganda films (e.g., ""49th Parallel"", ""Pimpernel Smith"") and in spy activities for which he ultimately paid with his life.  To get this film off the ground, Howard got the help of Winston Churchill which, in turn, got him the use of real aircraft and fields as well as pilots and ground crew.Howard's good friend David Niven (1910-83) plays an RAF Station Leader and tells the story in flashbacks from 1922 to 1937 as the RAF pilots prepare for another mission.. Niven won an Oscar for ""Separate Tables"" (1959) and a Golden Globe for ""The Moon is Blue"" (1953), but he's probably best known for his role as Phileas Fogg in ""Around the World in 80 Days"" (1956).FWIW - Niven was given leave from his position as a Major in the British Army to make this film.Howard's daughter Leslie Ruth Howard appears as Nurse Kennedy.The film can be criticized for many historical inaccuracies, among them the fact that Howard neither looked like nor acted like Mitchell, the meeting between Mitchell and Merschschmidt never took place, and Mitchell did not die from TB but rather from colon cancer. As well, despite the fact that the film covers 20 years, neither Howard nor Niven appear to age.The Battle of Britain has been the subject of many films; the better ones include Henry King's  ""A Yank in the RAF"" (1941) with Robert Taylor, Frank Capra's 1943 ""Battle of Britain"", and Guy Hamilton's ""Battle of Britain"" (1969) with an all star British cast1942 was a good year in films - ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" and ""Mrs. Miniver"" were the clear Oscar winners and at the box office. Other popular films included ""Casablanca"", ""Woman of the Year"", Alan Ladd's ""This Gun for Hire"", Gary Cooper's ""Pride of the Yankees"", and ""Road to Morocco""Many films in 1942 dealt with the war - ""Across the Pacific"", ""Flying Tigers"", ""The Goose Steps Out"", ""In Which we Serve"", ""Invisible Agent"", ""One of Our Aircraft is Missing"", ""Saboteur"", and ""Wake Island"".BFI Monthly said ""This film is brilliantly conceived, superbly produced and directed, and has some of the finest lighting and photography yet seen in British films. The flying sequences are exceptionally effective. But perhaps outstanding is the portrait of R. J. Mitchell by Leslie Howard.""A sad note - Leslie Howard was killed when his plane was shot down by the Luftwaffe on June 1, 1943, a few months after the film's release.This is a good film with some stunning photography of early sea planes and Spitfires in action. The acting is uniformly good and the photography and music are appropriate. If one can fault the film at all it is in some of the production values, but considering that a war was taking place, these can be overlooked.Fans of film bios, of British WW 2 films, and of Leslie Howard and David Niven will certainly want to view this film.",4,Good World War 2 Bio pic,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,4836,"['summer', 'early', 'fall', '1940', 'when', 'Nazis', 'were', 'bombing',

It is a propaganda movie from 1942, a very troubled time for England, when England was in great need for heros and Mitchell fits the bill, an eccentric, calm, pipe smoking, public school and very amiable sort of fellow.The story is captivating and very believable, a one mans struggle to make the perfect areoplane, then the perfect fighter. It is so good you want to believe everything is true - and even if it is riddled with historical inaccuracies - you have to remember that it is just the film that was needed at the time.The leading actors are most loveable, David Niven is at his best and has some rather convincing drunken scenes but it is Leslie Howard of Gone with the Wind fame as Mitchell that captures the audience. This was Howards last film as an actor since he was later in a plane shot down by the Germans. David Niven continued to contribute to the war effort both in films and as a commando in the Normandy landings.The transfer to DVD is not that great, the film is a bit worn with time but there is no serious damage, also it is in a 4:3 aspect so no wide screen expectations.

800829,A20QYY9BECJKMA,B0001DCY00,Jennifer,"[1, 1]","Exceptional program about the life of R.J. Mitchell, British inventor of the 'Spitfire' airplane. Mitchell changed the course of British aircraft history. Those who had known Mitchell well described him as an adaptive genius, possessing excellent attention to detail, and was a great thinker. Mitchell passed away just after the 'Spitfire' was completed and put into action during World War II, but he and his plane will never be forgotten!R.J. Mitchell was born in Staffordshire, England. After leaving Hanley High School at the age of 16 he gained an apprenticeship at Kerr Stuart & Co. of Fenton, a locomotive engineering company. At the end of his apprenticeship he worked in the drawing office at Kerr Stuart and studied engineering and mathematics at night school.In 1917, he joined the Supermarine Aviation Works at Southampton. Advancing quickly within the company, Mitchell was appointed Chief Designer in 1919. He was made Chief Engineer in 1920 and Technical Director in 1927. He was so highly regarded that, when Vickers took over Supermarine in 1928, one of the conditions was that Mitchell stay as a designer for the next five years.Between 1920 and 1936, Mitchell designed 24 aircraft including light aircraft, fighters and bombers. As Supermarine was primarily a seaplane manufacturer, this included a number of flying boats such as the Supermarine Sea Eagle, the Supermarine Sea King, the Supermarine Walrus and Supermarine Stranraer. However, Mitchell is best remembered for his work on a series of racing aircraft, which culminated in the Supermarine, and the famous Supermarine Spitfire fighter.In 1931 the Air Ministry issued specification F7/30 for a fighter aircraft to replace the Gloster Gauntlet. Mitchell's proposed design, the Type 224 was one of three designs for which the Air Ministry ordered prototypes.Mitchell was awarded the CBE in 1932 for his contribution to high-speed flight.The Supermarine Spitfire first flew on February 19, 1934, but was eventually rejected by the RAF because of its unsatisfactory performance. While the 224 was being built, Mitchell was authorized by Supermarine in 1933 to proceed with a new design, the Type 300, an all-metal monoplane that would become the Supermarine Spitfire. This was originally a private venture by Supermarine, but the RAF quickly became interested and the Air Ministry financed a prototype.The first prototype Spitfire, serial K5054, flew for the first time on March 5,1936 at Eastleigh, Hampshire. In later tests, it reached 349 mph, consequently, before the prototype had completed its official trials, the RAF ordered 310 production Spitfires. Mitchell is reported to have said that ""Spitfire was just the sort of bloody, silly name they would choose.""In 1936 Mitchell was diagnosed with cancer, and subsequently, in early 1937, Mitchell gave up work, although he was often seen watching the Spitfire being tested. Mitchell went to the American Foundation in Vienna for a month, but died on June 11, 1937 at the age 42.Mitchell's design was so sound that the Spitfire was continually improved throughout the Second World War. Over 22,000 Spitfires and derivatives were built.At the end of his life, Mitchell was quoted as saying, ""If anybody ever tells you anything about an aeroplane which is so bloody complicated you can't understand it, take it from me: it's all balls.""Watch this program. It is truly a great memorial to a remarkable man!",5,"""It was a bloody, silly name for a plane,"" said Mitchell",1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,3433,"['Exceptional', 'program', 'life', 'R.J.', 'Mitchell', 'British', 'inventor', ""'Spitfire"", 'airplane', 'Mitchell', 'changed', 'course', 'British', 'aircraft', 'history', 'who', 'had', 'known', 'Mitchell', 'well', 'described', 'adaptive', 'genius', 'possessing', 'excellent', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'great', 'thinker', 'Mitchell', 'passed', 'away', 'just', ""'Spitfire"", 'was', 'completed', 'put', 'action', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'plane', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'R.J', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'born', 'Staffordshire', 'England', 'leaving', 'Hanley', 'High', 'School', 'age', '16', 'gained', 'apprenticeship', 'Kerr', 'Stuart', 'Co.', 'Fenton', 'locomotive', 'engineering', 'company', 'end', 'apprenticeship', 'worked', 'drawing', 'office', 'Kerr', 'Stuart', 'studied', 'engineering', 'mathematics', 'night', 'school.In', '1917', 'joined', 'Supermarine', 'Aviation', 'Works', 'Southampton', 'Advancing', 'quickly', 'company', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'appointed', 'Chief', 'Designer', '1919', 'was', 'made', 'Chief', 'Engineer', '1920', 'Technical', 'Director', '1927', 'was', 'so', 'highly', 'regarded', 'when', 'Vickers', 'took', 'over', 'Supermarine', '1928', 'one', 'conditions', 'was', 'Mitchell', 'stay', 'designer', 'next', 'five', 'years.Between', '1920', '1936', 'Mitchell', 'designed', '24', 'aircraft', 'including', 'light', 'aircraft', 'fighters', 'bombers', 'Supermarine', 'was', 'primarily', 'seaplane', 'manufacturer', 'included', 'number', 'flying', 'boats', 'such', 'Supermarine', 'Sea', 'Eagle', 'Supermarine', 'Sea', 'King', 'Supermarine', 'Walrus', 'Supermarine', 'Stranraer', 'However', 'Mitchell', 'best', 'remembered', 'work', 'series', 'racing', 'aircraft', 'culminated', 'Supermarine', 'famous', 'Supermarine', 'Spitfire', 'fighter.In', '1931', 'Air', 'Ministry', 'issued', 'specification', 'F7/30', 'fighter', 'aircraft', 'replace', 'Gloster', 'Gauntlet', 'Mitchell', 'proposed', 'design', 'Type', '224', 'was', 'one', 'three', 'designs', 'Air', 'Ministry', 'ordered', 'prototypes.Mitchell', 'was', 'awarded', 'CBE', '1932', 'contribution', 'high-speed', 'flight.The', 'Supermarine', 'Spitfire', 'first', 'flew', 'February', '19', '1934', 'was', 'eventually', 'rejected', 'RAF', 'unsatisfactory', 'performance', '224', 'was', 'being', 'built', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'authorized', 'Supermarine', '1933', 'proceed', 'new', 'design', 'Type', '300', 'all-metal', 'monoplane', 'would', 'become', 'Supermarine', 'Spitfire', 'was', 'originally', 'private', 'venture', 'Supermarine', 'RAF', 'quickly', 'became', 'interested', 'Air', 'Ministry', 'financed', 'prototype.The', 'first', 'prototype', 'Spitfire', 'serial', 'K5054', 'flew', 'first', 'time', 'March', '5,1936', 'Eastleigh', 'Hampshire', 'later', 'tests', 'reached', '349', 'mph', 'consequently', 'prototype', 'had', 'completed', 'official', 'trials', 'RAF', 'ordered', '310', 'production', 'Spitfires', 'Mitchell', 'reported', 'have', 'said', 'Spitfire', 'was', 'just', 'sort', 'bloody', 'silly', 'name', 'would', 'choose', '1936', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'subsequently', 'early', '1937', 'Mitchell', 'gave', 'up', 'work', 'was', 'often', 'seen', 'watching', 'Spitfire', 'being', 'tested', 'Mitchell', 'went', 'American', 'Foundation', 'Vienna', 'month', 'died', 'June', '11', '1937', 'age', '42.Mitchell', 'design', 'was', 'so', 'sound', 'Spitfire', 'was', 'continually', 'improved', 'Second', 'World', 'War', '22,000', 'Spitfires', 'derivatives', 'were', 'end', 'life', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', 'anybody', 'ever', 'anything', 'aeroplane', 'so', 'bloody', 'complicated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'take', 'balls', 'Watch', 'program', 'truly', 'great', 'memorial', 'remarkable', 'man']",N/A

800838,AM1672DGAV2TY,B0001DCY00,Theo J.,"[7, 8]","THE FIRST OF THE FEW (1942) is a fictionalized story of British aircraft designer Reginald Mitchell, and his race to create the legendary Supermarine Spitfire. Mitchell produced his masterpiece while battling the cancer which ultimately claimed him in 1937; the film takes a few liberties with biographical details, but as wartime propaganda it's meant to be emotional rather than cut-and-dried history. The film features not only actual RAF Fighter Command pilots in cameo roles, but a rousing sequence with aerobatics performed by Supermarine pilot Jeffrey Quill (the Spitfire's developmental test pilot all the way through the war).Tragically, Leslie Howard himself became a casualty of the air war in Europe; while in Portugal on an ostensibly non-governmental mission, Howard was targeted by German Intelligence agents. The civilian airliner on which he was flying home was attacked by Luftwaffe fighters, and shot down with no survivors. He never lived to see the full success of his final film. It survives today as a memorial both to Leslie Howard and to Reginald Mitchell, and a tribute to Britain's determination to survive against attempted invasion. It also celebrates the magnificent creation which is the Spitfire itself---and has no doubt added to the popular mystique which the airplane has acquired over the last seventy-plus years.(NOTE: the best Region 1 DVD version I've seen is from Odeon Entertainment's 'Best Of British' collection.)",4,The First Of The Few (1942) Directed by Leslie Howard,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,1456,"['FIRST', 'THE', 'FEW', '1942', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'British', 'aircraft', 'designer', 'Reginald', 'Mitchell', 'race', 'create', 'legendary', 'Supermarine', 'Spitfire', 'Mitchell', 'produced', 'masterpiece', 'battling', 'cancer', 'ultimately', 'claimed', '1937', 'film', 'few', 'liberties', 'biographical', 'details', 'wartime', 'meant', 'be', 'emotional', 'rather', 'cut-and-dried', 'history', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'actual', 'RAF', 'Fighter', 'Command', 'pilots', 'cameo', 'roles', 'rousing', 'sequence', 'aerobatics', 'performed', 'Supermarine', 'pilot', 'Jeffrey', 'Quill', 'Spitfire', 'developmental', 'test', 'pilot', 'way', 'war', '.Tragically', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'became', 'casualty', 'air', 'war', 'Europe', 'Portugal', 'ostensibly', 'non-governmental', 'mission', 'Howard', 'was', 'targeted', 'German', 'Intelligence', 'agents', 'civilian', 'airliner', 'was', 'flying', 'home', 'was', 'attacked', 'Luftwaffe', 'fighters', 'shot', 'down', 'survivors', 'never', 'lived', 'see', 'full', 'success', 'final', 'film', 'today', 'memorial', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'Reginald', 'Mitchell', 'tribute', 'Britain', 'determination', 'survive', 'attempted', 'invasion', 'also', 'magnificent', 'creation', 'Spitfire', '-and', 'doubt', 'added', 'popular', 'mystique', 'airplane', 'acquired', 'last', 'seventy-plus', 'years', 'NOTE', 'best', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'version', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Odeon', 'Entertainment', ""'Best"", 'British', 'collection']",N/A
