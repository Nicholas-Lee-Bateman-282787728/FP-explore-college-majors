The concerts are all recorded in good quality sound and you will even hear John's voice occasionally slip or crack on the high notes which for some strange reason I am glad they did not edit out. There is of course repeats of his famous songs on all the DVD's but if you are a fan you want to hear them over and over again, just at a different venue. His concert in japan is cool when he brings a youngster up to help him see a song, also like his live version of ""The harder They fall"" when he rarely plays an electric guitar. It's so sad he was taken away to early and there will never be another like him.",5,Still None Like Him,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,672,"['great', '5', 'DVD', 'set', 'get', 'must', 'JD', 'fans', 'concerts', 'are', 'recorded', 'good', 'quality', 'sound', 'will', 'even', 'hear', 'John', 'voice', 'occasionally', 'slip', 'crack', 'high', 'notes', 'strange', 'reason', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'edit', 'out', 'course', 'repeats', 'famous', 'songs', 'DVD', 'are', 'fan', 'want', 'hear', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'just', 'different', 'venue', 'concert', 'japan', 'cool', 'when', 'youngster', 'up', 'help', 'see', 'song', 'also', 'live', 'version', 'harder', 'fall', 'when', 'rarely', 'electric', 'guitar', 'so', 'sad', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'early', 'will', 'never', 'be']",N/A

1268919,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,B002HTP7H8,G. Garner,"[108, 114]","I've always loved John and his music. However, in the years since his tragic death, I've actually come to appreciate him more. As I progress in my own life experience, I can understand with greater clarity just how powerful this man was.Time and again, he made choices that had an adverse effect upon his career. There are so many times when he stayed true to himself, even though he understood that there would be a price to pay. RCA thought he should go ahead and 'define' himself as a country artist. But he had no interest in restricting himself to one particular genre, no matter how profitable it might be.With his wholesome, cleancut image,and his undeniably pristine worldview, he could have been the preeminent superstar for America's churchgoing community. However, his spirituality was unconventional, and he said so. Again, this cost him heavily. I know. I'm from the Deep South, and I know Fundamentalist types who despise him for this very reason.Now, between those 2 audiences, that's an awful lot of money that he simply gave up.Then, in the 80's, he spoke out forcefully at the Senate Hearings on censorship. John certainly had nothing to gain from any of this. If anything, he stood to LOSE fans. But he went to the mat for free speech, when some of the people who had the most to gain.............. stayed quietly on the sidelines.I think he was an impressive man. Of course, I'm not looking to make him out to be more than a man. He had his flaws, like all of us. But, at the end of the day, he handled money, fame, and influence in a way that others would do well to emulate.When it comes to his music, what can you say? I mean, you just don't run out of great songs. He was such an incredible talent. And his music, in addition to being melodic and beautiful, spoke to things that many of us deem the essential elements of life. Has anyone ever used the imagery of the natural world with such vivid effect?A great example of his depth and brilliance came at the beginning, and the end, of one of my favorite albums, 'Spirit.' The first song on this cd is 'Come and Let Me Look In Your Eyes.' The final song is 'The Wings That Fly Us Home.' Each of these tunes represent the quest for spiritual enlightenment, and the process of seeking answers to life's questions.They deal with similar aspirations. But the first is told from the perspective of confusion, even despair. The second, while exploring the same themes, is rendered from a place of majesty, awe.........and peace.So many critics try to make him out to be trite and irrelevant(probably my least favorite word.Who are they to tell anybody what is relevant?) But I think you'll find more strength and depth in John than you will in any of his detractors.What can I say? John Denver was the best. This dvd collection is long overdue. I hope that, ultimately, they release some of his classic tv specials. He was one of a kind.",5,I Think I Appreciate Him More Every Year,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,2906,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'John', 'music', 'However', 'years', 'tragic', 'death', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'come', 'appreciate', 'more', 'progress', 'own', 'life', 'experience', 'can', 'understand', 'greater', 'clarity', 'just', 'how', 'powerful', 'man', 'was.Time', 'again', 'made', 'choices', 'had', 'adverse', 'effect', 'career', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'stayed', 'true', 'even', 'understood', 'would', 'be', 'price', 'pay', 'RCA', 'thought', 'should', 'go', 'ahead', ""'define"", 'country', 'artist', 'had', 'interest', 'restricting', 'one', 'particular', 'genre', 'matter', 'how', 'profitable', 'might', 'be.With', 'wholesome', 'cleancut', 'image', 'undeniably', 'pristine', 'worldview', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'preeminent', 'superstar', 'America', 'churchgoing', 'community', 'However', 'spirituality', 'was', 'unconventional', 'said', 'so', 'Again', 'cost', 'heavily', 'know', ""'m"", 'Deep', 'South', 'know', 'Fundamentalist', 'types', 'who', 'despise', 'very', 'reason.Now', '2', 'audiences', 'awful', 'lot', 'money', 'simply', 'gave', 'up.Then', '80', 'spoke', 'out', 'forcefully', 'Senate', 'Hearings', 'censorship', 'John', 'certainly', 'had', 'nothing', 'gain', 'anything', 'stood', 'LOSE', 'fans', 'went', 'mat', 'free', 'speech', 'when', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'most', 'gain', 'stayed', 'quietly', 'sidelines.I', 'think', 'was', 'impressive', 'man', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'looking', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'man', 'had', 'flaws', 'end', 'day', 'handled', 'money', 'fame', 'influence', 'way', 'others', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'emulate.When', 'music', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'mean', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'out', 'great', 'songs', 'was', 'such', 'incredible', 'talent', 'music', 'addition', 'being', 'melodic', 'beautiful', 'spoke', 'things', 'many', 'deem', 'essential', 'elements', 'life', 'Has', 'anyone', 'ever', 'used', 'imagery', 'natural', 'world', 'such', 'vivid', 'effect', 'great', 'example', 'depth', 'brilliance', 'came', 'beginning', 'end', 'one', 'favorite', 'albums', 'first', 'song', 'cd', ""'Come"", 'Let', 'Me', 'Look', 'Eyes', 'final', 'song', ""'The"", 'Wings', 'Fly', 'Us', 'Home', 'tunes', 'represent', 'quest', 'spiritual', 'enlightenment', 'process', 'seeking', 'answers', 'life', 'questions.They', 'deal', 'similar', 'aspirations', 'first', 'told', 'perspective', 'confusion', 'even', 'despair', 'second', 'exploring', 'same', 'themes', 'rendered', 'place', 'majesty', 'awe', 'peace.So', 'many', 'critics', 'try', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'trite', 'irrelevant', 'probably', 'least', 'favorite', 'word.Who', 'are', 'tell', 'anybody', 'what', 'relevant', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'more', 'strength', 'depth', 'John', 'will', 'detractors.What', 'can', 'say', 'John', 'Denver', 'was', 'best', 'dvd', 'collection', 'long', 'overdue', 'hope', 'ultimately', 'release', 'classic', 'tv', 'specials', 'was', 'one', 'kind']",N/A

Unlike the excellent ""Wildlife Concert,"" these are actual concerts, flaws and all, that show what an extraordinary live performer John Denver really was.  Some have complained about the imperfections in the DVDs' sound and video quality, but remember that the restoration team, led by Barry Ehrmann, was dealing with videos ranging from 32 to 18 years old; that considered, the sound and picture are surpringly strong and present.  Also, it is great to have all of Denver's Farm Aid performances together and to finally have ""Bighorn"" on DVD.  I would love to have had other Denver performances here (for example, his 1982 ""Man and His Music"" BBC concert), but that's a small quibble.

1268922,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,B002HTP7H8,Rons Reviews,"[23, 26]","John Denver - Around the World LiveOn October 13th Eagle Records released what is being heralded as the definitive John Denver DVD Release. ""Definitive"" is one way to describe it.  ""Eclectic"" is another, and ""excessive"" is also an option.Consisting of four live concerts: ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy"" Live in Australia 1977, ""Rocky Mountain High"" Live in Japan 1981, ""Country Roads"" Live in England 1986, ""Solo Acoustic Show"" Live in Japan 1984, his ""Farm Aid Performances"" 1985, 1987, 1990, and two documentaries ""Earth Day"" 1990, and ""Day at Bighorn"" 1972, the collection has 592 minutes of material on 5 discs.The collection is definitive in that it spans more than ten years of live performances, it is eclectic in that it includes such things as the Earth Day documentary, which may have been one of Mr. Denvers passions, and is briefly hosted by him, but it really has little to do with him, and the material is outdated, and the collection is excessive in it's repetitiveness.  The collection includes no less than six performances of ""Take me Home Country Roads"", and numerous performances of other Denver Classics.Though it is interesting to watch how the technology to film a concert advanced over the years, eventually the footage becomes more enjoyable to listen to, rather than to sit and watch an incredibly talented man, stand in front of a microphone and strum his guitar.  The concert from Australia in 1977 is awkward from the opening where it fails to properly capture Denvers introduction, and remains awkwardly filmed throughout. As technology improved over the years, so does the footage of the concerts.The documentary ""Day at the Bighorn"" lends the most insight into Denver, his personality, and his passion for animals and the great outdoors, but it is clumsily edited, and generally results in poor story telling.The gem in this release is the acoustic performance in Japan from 1984, as it truly displays the immense talent and vocal range of Denver.The sound quality of all segments is excellent, and most of the footage looks great if you are so inclined to watch all of it.Recommendation:  This collection seems thrown together, as the Earth Day documentary seems out of place. A documentary on John Denvers Life would have made for the perfect conclusion to the story that was attempted to be told here.  Even the addition of the made for television movie ""Take Me Home: The John Denver Story"" from 2000 with Chad Lowe as Denver, would have made for a more well rounded release.  The true fan may enjoy sitting and watching all of this, but most will simply enjoy listening to some of it.",2,Too Much of the Same Thing.,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,2620,"['John', 'Denver', 'World', 'LiveOn', 'October', '13th', 'Eagle', 'Records', 'released', 'what', 'being', 'heralded', 'definitive', 'John', 'Denver', 'DVD', 'Release', 'Definitive', 'one', 'way', 'describe', 'Eclectic', 'excessive', 'also', 'option.Consisting', 'four', 'live', 'concerts', 'Thank', 'God', ""'m"", 'Country', 'Boy', 'Live', 'Australia', '1977', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'High', 'Live', 'Japan', '1981', 'Country', 'Roads', 'Live', 'England', '1986', 'Solo', 'Acoustic', 'Show', 'Live', 'Japan', '1984', 'Farm', 'Aid', 'Performances', '1985', '1987', '1990', 'two', 'documentaries', 'Earth', 'Day', '1990', 'Day', 'Bighorn', '1972', 'collection', '592', 'minutes', 'material', '5', 'discs.The', 'collection', 'definitive', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'live', 'performances', 'eclectic', 'such', 'things', 'Earth', 'Day', 'documentary', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Denvers', 'passions', 'briefly', 'hosted', 'really', 'little', 'do', 'material', 'outdated', 'collection', 'excessive', 'repetitiveness', 'collection', 'less', 'six', 'performances', 'Take', 'Home', 'Country', 'Roads', 'numerous', 'performances', 'other', 'Denver', 'Classics.Though', 'interesting', 'watch', 'how', 'technology', 'film', 'concert', 'advanced', 'years', 'eventually', 'footage', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'rather', 'sit', 'watch', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'man', 'stand', 'front', 'microphone', 'strum', 'guitar', 'concert', 'Australia', '1977', 'awkward', 'opening', 'where', 'properly', 'capture', 'Denvers', 'introduction', 'awkwardly', 'filmed', 'technology', 'improved', 'years', 'so', 'footage', 'concerts.The', 'documentary', 'Day', 'Bighorn', 'most', 'insight', 'Denver', 'personality', 'passion', 'animals', 'great', 'outdoors', 'clumsily', 'edited', 'generally', 'results', 'poor', 'story', 'telling.The', 'gem', 'release', 'acoustic', 'performance', 'Japan', '1984', 'immense', 'talent', 'vocal', 'range', 'Denver.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'segments', 'excellent', 'most', 'footage', 'great', 'are', 'so', 'inclined', 'watch', 'it.Recommendation', 'collection', 'thrown', 'together', 'Earth', 'Day', 'documentary', 'place', 'documentary', 'John', 'Denvers', 'Life', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', 'conclusion', 'story', 'was', 'attempted', 'be', 'told', 'here', 'Even', 'addition', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'John', 'Denver', 'Story', '2000', 'Chad', 'Lowe', 'Denver', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'release', 'true', 'fan', 'may', 'enjoy', 'sitting', 'watching', 'most', 'will', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'listening']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 11]","A must for Denver Fans.. but lots of repeated songsThis box set of five DVDs is about a complete collection of  the ""Rocky Mountain High"" singer's filmed and taped performances as you will find and covers the years from just after his hit ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy"" to his later years performing at Farm Aid. There is certainly a lot of performance time with two of the full concerts - one in Australia (20,000 people in an outside sports stadium); another in England (almost as many there too) - running two hours each, and the other three concerts spanning about 75-minutes. Add to this the Farm Aid performances and a few songs sung during the film ""Day at the Bighorn"" and there's a lot of John singin' and grinnin'. But how many times can you hear ""Take Me Home, Country Roads""? That song, and ""Matthew"" each appear TWICE on just the Farm Aid section and, of course, are in the other concerts. Same for ""Annie's Song"", ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" and most of his big ""hits"". Sure there are lesser known songs - most of which have not been overexposed - but you have to wade through the ""hits"" (again!) to get to them.The fifth disc contains the EPA environmental film ""Earth Day 1990"" with basically no music and ""Day At Bighorn"" (in which Denver and a friend visit the Rocky Mountains, alone - well, with a film crew, of course). The quality of the print on this is poor and the sound muffled and distorted.Though its probably great for the Denver completist, the package is  ""overkill"" and a more carefully edited package would have given this a higher rating from me.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,A must for Denver Fans.. but lots of repeated songs,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,1608,"['must', 'Denver', 'Fans..', 'lots', 'repeated', 'songsThis', 'box', 'set', 'five', 'DVDs', 'complete', 'collection', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'High', 'singer', 'filmed', 'taped', 'performances', 'will', 'find', 'years', 'just', 'hit', 'Thank', 'God', ""'m"", 'Country', 'Boy', 'later', 'years', 'performing', 'Farm', 'Aid', 'certainly', 'lot', 'performance', 'time', 'two', 'full', 'concerts', 'one', 'Australia', '20,000', 'people', 'outside', 'sports', 'stadium', 'England', 'almost', 'many', 'too', 'running', 'two', 'hours', 'other', 'three', 'concerts', 'spanning', '75-minutes', 'Add', 'Farm', 'Aid', 'performances', 'few', 'songs', 'sung', 'film', 'Day', 'Bighorn', 'lot', 'John', 'singin', 'grinnin', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'hear', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'Country', 'Roads', 'song', 'Matthew', 'appear', 'TWICE', 'just', 'Farm', 'Aid', 'section', 'course', 'are', 'other', 'concerts', 'Same', 'Annie', 'Song', 'Leaving', 'Jet', 'Plane', 'most', 'big', 'hits', 'Sure', 'are', 'lesser', 'known', 'songs', 'most', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'overexposed', 'have', 'wade', 'hits', 'again', 'get', 'them.The', 'fifth', 'disc', 'EPA', 'environmental', 'film', 'Earth', 'Day', '1990', 'basically', 'music', 'Day', 'Bighorn', 'Denver', 'friend', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', 'alone', 'well', 'film', 'crew', 'course', 'quality', 'print', 'poor', 'sound', 'muffled', 'probably', 'great', 'Denver', 'completist', 'package', 'overkill', 'more', 'carefully', 'edited', 'package', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'higher', 'rating', 'me.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

Although the Wild Life concert was also an excellent staging of John Denver's music the concerts presented in this box set gives the viewer a more complete look at the pure artistry and talent John Denver delivered while performing live. In today's over produced concerts with elaborate dancers and stage productions the simplicity and brilliance of a John Denver concert shines through on each disk. It is a rare performer who can hold an audience in the palm of his hand while mesmerizing, thrilling and touching them with just his songs, his personality and a small backing band.The quality of the DVDs are spectacular. Eagle Rock did a great job restoring the footage to pristine quality making you feel you have a front row seat to your own JD concert which you can enjoy any time you want to. The song selections cover his greatest hits while sampling a wide variety of his lesser known but high quality material. But what soars above it all is his voice which was clear as a mountain stream and as powerful as a thunderstorm in spring.A bonus on disk 5 are two documentaries. The first one is a 1990 Earth Day related documentary speaking of the environmental movement and its importance to us all. It stars John and is educational, quite interesting but never preachy. The second documentary is his 1972 Bighorn documentary. This is classic John Denver in his element, out in the rocky mountains learning about the Bighorn sheep and all the other animals that live there. This documentary is peppered with Johns music throughout including the tongue in cheek tune ""How to say hello to a Grizzly Bear."" Many fans have been waiting for this gem to be released on DVD and this will not disappoint.If you're a fan of John Denver then this is an absolute must have for your collection.
