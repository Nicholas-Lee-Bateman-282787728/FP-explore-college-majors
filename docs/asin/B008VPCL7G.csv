1576845,A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB,B008VPCL7G,"ANT ""azraelart""","[2, 3]","I am giving Chernobyl Diaries three stars for a few reasons.  First, the Chernobyl incident intrigues me, and I very much soaked in the feeling of desolation and isolation inside the Zone (of alienation, around the towns [Prypiat, in this case] that were abandoned because of the fallout).  I really felt the filmmakers captured the loneliness, bleakness, and silence as nature reclaims the land.Second, the movie avoids falling into certain pitfalls that it so very easily could have.  For instance (not a real spoiler alert), there aren't as many 'jump out of the shadows and blah scream yah scared-ya' moments as there could be.  Also, I don't think they made a 3D version, so it also avoids the gratuitous tosses towards the camera.Lastly, the cinematographers do a good job of intelligently building suspense and intrigue, and without the far-too-silly premises that a nuclear radiation incident could have created.  True, there is a lot left to the imagination in some respects, and there might be some questions at the end.  That means there wasn't the overwhelming desire to 'monster it up,' or other such nonsense that has become so clich&eacute; in horror movies these days.On the other hand, it does fall into several of those same pitfalls, unfortunately.  The dialogue is at times poorly written, laughably corny, and horribly delivered (with the 'younger brother' character having the lion's share of these lines and performances).  Does every movie in the genre have to have the sappy love story, the break-up character, the newcomers, the siblings... enough already.There are also several historical inaccuracies, which one can sometimes chalk up to artistic license, I suppose, but perhaps not when you are referencing an actual site with plenty of archival material for suitable replication.  If you are going to spend the money to create a nuclear power plant for your film, why would you spend more money to add features (the familiar curvy cooling towers) that aren't even there?  It hits on a lot of key points, but misses on some others.  This isn't a documentary, I get that, but a little extra effort would have actually contributed to a better film in this case: truth is far scarier than fiction sometimes.Ultimately, though, it fails because it is just too formulaic to stand apart, despite the unique (sort of) subject matter and fresh faces.  Even though it built in the suspense wonderfully and avoided a lot of cheap tricks, it still could not help following the same tired maneuvers and devices.  ""We have to go back!  Because!""  (I'm paraphrasing, but you get the point).  ""I'm not leaving him behind!""  ""What was that?""  *groan*Overall, it still was enjoyable, again mostly for the subject matter, the real over the fictional elements, the build up, and the cinematography (when it wasn't resorting to the nauseating handi-cam shots, which I think have been played out since the time of Cloverfield).  If you have interest in abandoned cities, nuclear disaster consequences, and the real-life stories of Chernobyl, I'd highly recommend a good documentary first, and then this one for some realism and a bit of fun.  You know what you're getting into, though; don't expect to be blown away, but enjoy it for what it is.",3,"Intriguing, but falls short",1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,3253,"['am', 'giving', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'three', 'stars', 'few', 'reasons', 'First', 'Chernobyl', 'incident', 'intrigues', 'very', 'much', 'soaked', 'feeling', 'desolation', 'isolation', 'Zone', 'alienation', 'towns', '[', 'Prypiat', 'case', 'were', 'abandoned', 'fallout', 'really', 'felt', 'filmmakers', 'captured', 'loneliness', 'bleakness', 'silence', 'nature', 'land.Second', 'movie', 'falling', 'certain', 'pitfalls', 'so', 'very', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'instance', 'not', 'real', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'shadows', 'blah', 'scream', 'yah', 'scared-ya', 'moments', 'could', 'be', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'made', '3D', 'version', 'also', 'gratuitous', 'tosses', 'camera.Lastly', 'cinematographers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'intelligently', 'building', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'far-too-silly', 'premises', 'nuclear', 'radiation', 'incident', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'True', 'lot', 'left', 'imagination', 'respects', 'might', 'be', 'questions', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'overwhelming', 'desire', ""'monster"", 'up', 'other', 'such', 'nonsense', 'become', 'so', 'clich', 'eacute', 'horror', 'movies', 'days.On', 'other', 'hand', 'fall', 'several', 'same', 'pitfalls', 'unfortunately', 'dialogue', 'times', 'poorly', 'written', 'laughably', 'corny', 'horribly', 'delivered', ""'younger"", 'brother', 'character', 'having', 'lion', 'share', 'lines', 'performances', 'movie', 'genre', 'have', 'have', 'sappy', 'love', 'story', 'break-up', 'character', 'newcomers', 'siblings', 'enough', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'one', 'can', 'sometimes', 'chalk', 'up', 'artistic', 'license', 'suppose', 'perhaps', 'not', 'when', 'are', 'referencing', 'actual', 'site', 'plenty', 'archival', 'material', 'suitable', 'replication', 'are', 'going', 'spend', 'money', 'create', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plant', 'film', 'why', 'would', 'spend', 'more', 'money', 'add', 'features', 'familiar', 'curvy', 'cooling', 'towers', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'lot', 'key', 'points', 'others', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'get', 'little', 'extra', 'effort', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'contributed', 'better', 'film', 'case', 'truth', 'far', 'scarier', 'fiction', 'sometimes.Ultimately', 'just', 'too', 'formulaic', 'stand', 'apart', 'unique', 'sort', 'subject', 'matter', 'fresh', 'Even', 'suspense', 'wonderfully', 'avoided', 'lot', 'cheap', 'tricks', 'still', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'following', 'same', 'tired', 'maneuvers', 'devices', 'have', 'go', 'back', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'get', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'leaving', 'What', 'was', '*groan*Overall', 'still', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'again', 'mostly', 'subject', 'matter', 'real', 'fictional', 'elements', 'build', 'up', 'cinematography', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'resorting', 'nauseating', 'handi-cam', 'shots', 'think', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'time', 'Cloverfield', 'have', 'interest', 'abandoned', 'cities', 'nuclear', 'disaster', 'consequences', 'real-life', 'stories', 'Chernobyl', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'good', 'documentary', 'first', 'then', 'one', 'realism', 'bit', 'fun', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'enjoy', 'what']",Chernobyl Diaries

1576848,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008VPCL7G,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Chernobyl Diaries is highly recommended for anyone that likes the video game/movie series Silent Hill.  I mean, you have the dark dreary setting, dogs walking through a bleak environment, an eventual nighttime setting with people walking through the frightening torn down/deserted unknowns with flashlights... this is all too reminiscent of the Silent Hill series.  So yeah, it feels like a minor ripoff of Silent Hill but because I'm such a big fan of the series, I really don't care.Besides, this movie has *atmosphere* which many horror movies don't even bother including these days so I definitely respect that.  It's about a group of young adults that venture into the potentially dangerous radiation zone of the Chernobyl incident in Russia.  They're basically in the middle of nowhere when their vehicle breaks down so they're forced to make several decisions- look for car parts, wait for help to arrive or... my favorite, take the dreaded 13-14 mile walk to the nearest town.When night falls, this is when the monsters come out to play.  I don't want to spoil too much but just know that the mystery and eerieness of the daytime setting combined with the dreaded uncertainty of night translates into effective results for me.  I think the movie writers did a terrific job hiding the actual monsters.  For a long time we're not really sure what's going on because the film is based around atmosphere more than anything else, and this *exactly* what I'm looking for in a horror film. By the end... well the truth is, I *still* don't know what was out there.  I'm calling them monsters but it's probably inaccurate.  I have my suspicions but don't want to spill any potential spoilers, so I'll keep my mouth shut.This movie has everything going right for it.  Atmosphere and uncertainty is a winning combination.

1576851,A3ITYWFTPW71H2,B008VPCL7G,Brett Talley,"[1, 1]","There are few places more evocative and more truly horrifying than Prypiat, the city that serviced the reactors at Chernobyl. A modern city of 50,000, abandoned in a matter of days, everything left behind, frozen in time by the radiation danger that sealed its fate. If ever there was a place to set a horror film, Prypiat should be it.Which is one big reason that Chernobyl Diaries, a found footage horror movie from the creators of Paranormal Activity, is such a disappointment. The movie starts off strong. Four friends join an extreme tourism excursion to Prypiat, with the promise that they will see things that few alive have borne witness to. But when they arrive, the guards turn them away, much to the chagrin of their guide (and the best character in the film), Yuri. Not to be deterred, our intrepid explorers break into the city through a back gate. But once they begin to explore the ruins of Prypiat, they begin to suspect that they are not alone.The strength of Chernobyl Diaries is obviously Chernobyl and Prypiat themselves. The movie does a fantastic job of recreating the abandoned cities, and the period while the group is exploring the city--before anything unusual at all happens--is the best part of the film. But once things go badly, the film lurches into clich&eacute; and typical horror movie territory. People do stupid things they shouldn't do. They split up. They refuse to stay in places of relative safety. They turn their backs to dark hallways.Chernobyl Diaries is pretty standard bad horror movie fare. And that's a shame. It started off with so much potential.P.S. In March, I took my own trip to Prypiat. If you are interested in checking out the pictures, I've posted many of them on my blog.

You can't scare everyone with every movie you make, and for some reason, fans of the horror genre tend to be some of the most unforgiving around. That said; let me say that I actually enjoyed this film. Here are the reasons why:for the most part, the characters acted realistically (yes; when you are on the trip of a lifetime, sometimes for the sake of excitement people will go out on a limb and try something that in hindsight, might be a little dangerous. also one of the characters was a photographer, so the chance to photograph the reactor site would be worthwhile for her.) once the car was disabled, yes, I could see the tour guide going out to see who was out there. What some of the other reviewers didn't notice was that the truck didn't stall; it was disabled from the inside. Just sitting in the van doesn't guarantee safety; someone is obviously outside waiting for you.The atmosphere was pretty gothic, which is what I tend to look for in a horror movie. You had whoever disabled your vehicle tracking you, crazed, hungry animals chasing everyone, and a safe perimeter/boundary that you have to be careful of to avoid getting radiation poisoning. I found myself immersed in it, the way-too-beautiful people notwithstanding.***spoiler alert*** finally, there was the behavior of the Russian scientists, who were separate from the Russian military who shot one of the survivors. It kind of had a ""night of the living dead"" feel to it.

It is also unusual in that it departs from the well-worn scary movie formula of over-the-top gore and excessive violence.  For the better part of the movie, you are wondering just exactly what kind of threat the characters are facing.  So there is mystery there also.The idea behind the story is actually pretty good.  It takes place in Russia.  Here you have a group of young people looking for an adventure.  Or a ""kick"", depending on how you look at it.  So, when one of them decides to go on an extreme sightseeing tour, they agree to go along.  They hire a tour guide, Yuri.  They then board his tour van and off they go to Prypiat City.  Now, this city is located in Chernobyl.  The reactor employees and their families lived in this city.  When the meltdown of nuclear reactor 4 seemed inevitable, the families were then hastily evacuated.  There was no time to bring anything with them.  All their belongings were left behind, to rot away in what is now a ghost town.  The city and its surrounding forest has been vacant since 1986.  The area is off-limits to anyone.  Radiation levels are still too high.The group arrives at what appears to be the center of the old town of Prypiat.  The young people (3-boys, and 3-girls), along with Yuri, goes inside the empty buildings.  Here we see normal, everyday items left behind by the former residents.  Rusty cars, bicycles, and even a ferris wheel litter the landscape.  Nature has not quite reclaimed the city, but the process has definitely started.  After an hour or so, Yuri decided that it is now getting dark and they need to get out.  Unfortunately, the tour van refuses to start.  Someone, or something, has pulled off the distributor cap.  And so the horror begins.Now, the acting at times is substandard, but good enough for this type of movie.  Every horror movie has to have its fair share of idiots and this one is no exception.  Yeah, there is an idiot or two in every group.  I guess if the main characters were smart, there would not be a movie, right?

However, after the introduction of a decent set-up and some tolerable characters, the film goes almost nowhere until the very end.

There was no supernatural, Blair-Witch angle which would have made it classier or spookier to keep the threat out of the eye of the audience.  We find out what the problem is.  Why not show us something we can lock on for a second?  Why just show us blurry glimpses at this point?  It's aggravating.  The movie just spins its wheels while the dim-bulb characters run around like imbeciles.

The setting continues to be the star of the show.  It was fascinating to see the abandoned apartments, school rooms and even an amusement park.  The story, though, is not so interesting.  The characters spend a lot of time running from mutants which the audience never gets to see more than a glimpse of.  Other than the running and occasional bloody scenes, not much happens.  By the end of the movie, the survivors have somehow managed to travel many miles and end up, of course, inside one of the reactors.  It was just silly and nonsensical.  It wasn't scary.

Chernobyl Diaries follows this tired formula but has a few original quirks working in it's favor; the strongest one being it's unique and haunting location. Let's go over each aspect and I'll warn for spoilers because the best way to enjoy this is to know absolutely nothing.-The Characters: They're your typical idiot characters, the asserting D-bag, the timid naysayer, the big breasted bimbos, and the weird couple. However when s*** starts to hit the fan the actors pull past their stereotypes and go a bit above and beyond with their acting, and I'm sure they'll get some good acting offers after their horror stint with Chernobyl Diaries.-Atmosphere: Probably the best aspect about the movie. From the minute they step foot in the irradiated town there's an omnious chilling vibe to everything. The characters go through many abandoned rooms and there's a sense of decay to civilization (shame they didn't play off that more). The minute there's a threat established the director wisely plays it with subtlety. The camerawork is also excellent, it seems from the way it was filmed this could've very easily been a hand-held horror movie, and the director maintains the intimate closeness of that style without relying soley on it. The scene when everyone's in the van is all filmed from their point of view without any glimpses outside, you feel stuck with the characters.*Spoilers*-The Scares: The scares in this are completely downplayed which worked for the most part. Instead of showing close-ups of the monsters with blood and gruesome effects and all it shows them as shadows in the distance, and there are some great scenes where you see the shadows descending upon the characters in a vacant lot, showing a better side of horror than watching someone get killed with a chainsaw. I was hoping they'd take it further as the movie progressed but instead it just kept them as indiscernable shadows which got irriating after awhile. If something never establishes the threat after a suspenseful build-up it's not enough for me, so stuff like the Blair Witch Project or The Tunnel are all build-up and no payoff, just blueballs; while on the otherside movies like the Thing or the Descent have a great payoff that tops their build-up. Too much build-up just feels lazy to me.-The Payoff: What made Chernobyl Diaries' first half so good starts to play against it because at some point I was less concerned with the characters/story and more interested in just what exactly was going on, figuring out the mystery. Needless to say it did the whole 'less is more' approach and it didn't work for me. The last person alive gets caught by scientists who take her into a lab and throw her in a room with irradiated mutants. I guess they let a bunch of irradiated mutants loose in Chernobyl, but it made no sense why. Also the animals seemed mutated as well, did that have anything to do with it? It didn't really make the whole thing eerier, it just raised more questions than it answered, and after all that build-up and waiting I felt a bit cheated.So yeah, Chernobyl Diaries is very gripping, suspenseful, and creepy for it's first two acts, however on it's final act it seems to run out of steam and can't maintain the excellent atmosphere it kept up. Still a Nobyl *ba-dum tshh* effort on the director's part, because good atmospherical horror is rare to come by these days and I'll take what I can get.*Edit* I had a nightmare last night sort of related to the pale sickly fish in Chernobyl Diaries, so hey +1 for getting in my head!",3,"Brilliant Set-up, Weak Pay-off",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,3642,"['Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'horror', 'film', 'Old', 'Navy', 'models', 'doing', 'dumb', 'things', 'spooky', 'results', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'tired', 'formula', 'few', 'original', 'quirks', 'working', 'favor', 'strongest', 'one', 'being', 'unique', 'haunting', 'location', 'Let', 'go', 'aspect', ""'ll"", 'warn', 'spoilers', 'best', 'way', 'enjoy', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing.-The', 'Characters', ""'re"", 'typical', 'idiot', 'characters', 'asserting', 'D-bag', 'timid', 'naysayer', 'big', 'breasted', 'bimbos', 'weird', 'couple', 'However', 'when', 's***', 'hit', 'fan', 'actors', 'pull', 'stereotypes', 'go', 'bit', 'acting', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'acting', 'offers', 'horror', 'stint', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries.-Atmosphere', 'Probably', 'best', 'aspect', 'movie', 'minute', 'step', 'foot', 'irradiated', 'town', 'omnious', 'chilling', 'vibe', 'everything', 'characters', 'go', 'many', 'abandoned', 'rooms', 'sense', 'decay', 'civilization', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'off', 'more', 'minute', 'threat', 'established', 'director', 'wisely', 'subtlety', 'camerawork', 'also', 'excellent', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'could', ""'ve"", 'very', 'easily', 'been', 'hand-held', 'horror', 'movie', 'director', 'intimate', 'closeness', 'style', 'relying', 'soley', 'scene', 'when', 'everyone', 'van', 'filmed', 'point', 'view', 'glimpses', 'feel', 'stuck', 'characters', '*Spoilers*-The', 'Scares', 'scares', 'are', 'completely', 'downplayed', 'worked', 'most', 'part', 'Instead', 'showing', 'close-ups', 'monsters', 'blood', 'gruesome', 'effects', 'shadows', 'distance', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'where', 'see', 'shadows', 'descending', 'characters', 'vacant', 'lot', 'showing', 'better', 'side', 'horror', 'watching', 'someone', 'get', 'killed', 'chainsaw', 'was', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'take', 'further', 'movie', 'progressed', 'instead', 'just', 'kept', 'indiscernable', 'shadows', 'got', 'irriating', 'awhile', 'something', 'never', 'threat', 'suspenseful', 'build-up', 'not', 'enough', 'so', 'stuff', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Tunnel', 'are', 'build-up', 'payoff', 'just', 'blueballs', 'otherside', 'movies', 'Thing', 'Descent', 'have', 'great', 'payoff', 'build-up', 'Too', 'much', 'build-up', 'just', 'feels', 'lazy', 'me.-The', 'Payoff', 'What', 'made', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'good', 'starts', 'play', 'point', 'was', 'less', 'concerned', 'characters/story', 'more', 'interested', 'just', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'going', 'figuring', 'out', 'mystery', 'Needless', 'say', 'did', 'whole', ""'less"", 'more', 'approach', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'last', 'person', 'alive', 'caught', 'scientists', 'who', 'take', 'lab', 'throw', 'room', 'irradiated', 'mutants', 'guess', 'let', 'bunch', 'irradiated', 'mutants', 'loose', 'Chernobyl', 'made', 'sense', 'why', 'Also', 'animals', 'seemed', 'mutated', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'eerier', 'just', 'raised', 'more', 'questions', 'answered', 'build-up', 'waiting', 'felt', 'bit', 'cheated.So', 'yeah', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'very', 'gripping', 'suspenseful', 'creepy', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'however', 'final', 'act', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'ca', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'excellent', 'kept', 'up', 'Still', 'Nobyl', '*ba-dum', 'tshh*', 'effort', 'director', 'part', 'good', 'atmospherical', 'horror', 'rare', 'come', 'days', ""'ll"", 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', '*Edit*', 'had', 'nightmare', 'last', 'night', 'sort', 'related', 'pale', 'sickly', 'fish', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'hey', '+1', 'getting', 'head']",Chernobyl Diaries

You can't fault me! I was never a big fan of horror movies but from my knowledge of them this looked like a promising one to watch. I mean the title was interesting, the plot premise was too. And of my knowledge of Chernobyl (the nuclear reactor who exploded some 25 years back and all the damage it made) I thought this would make for an entertaining as well as an educating movie *hence the title DIARIES OF CHERNOBYL* I was expecting some Ghosts being disturbed or some dead bodies being awaken by the presence of humans but No..None of that happened.The film started out nicely, it was quick and straight to the point a group of tourists touring Europe for vacation and for visiting the brother of one of them who was supposed to be their guide his name is Paul. So, anyway they made it half way to come visit him in Ukraine and he thought it would be a great idea if he can take them to see Chernobyl no actually the town close to it some 20 miles away who got affected by the explosion of the nuclear reactor and is highly prohibited to enter by anyone except the Military not to mention the danger of getting exposure to the nuclear radiation that is still looming in the background. But it's OK for Paul it's all in good intention the goal is to have a good/adventurous time let's break the rules for once and be it a ride to remember. And of course it was a memorable ride even more so than they thought it would be. I was fine with the film till they wanted to get out of that small town of theirs then you have a classic example of a Horror flick. There's no originality we know that this and that is gonna eventually happen because how else are we supposed to see a story? I was hoping they would make the characters trapped in that town in a more original way! instead of the most obvious way. UGH! WHATEVER. Then the rest of it just went downhill the *monsters* or whatever you call them were interesting only when they were unknown! Once it was revealed what they were the first thing that got into my head was ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" Honestly, they weren't half as scary as I thought they were gonna look like. And don't even get me started on the ending, it was the most stupid/retarded intelligence insulting way that I've ever thought this movie could end.I think the one thing that saved this from being a 1 star movie to me, is the fact that I've seen it in the theaters. You know the BIG screen with the blazing Speakers actually do make a difference. It made the film bearable and well even suspending at some points but If I've seen this on my LCD TV here at home or on my computer then there's no way I'll find it as interesting.If You have nothing to watch and I mean absolutely NOTHING then I recommend you watch this, but in the end there are Better Horror films out there TRUST ME and I don't even watch them as often. This movie could've been much more if they had better writers and a better plot and certainly a better ending! I personally didn't mind the special effects or lack of them like some other reviews have said It's not what you have it's what you can do with it. I think this movie would've been great if the director had some imagination.2 Stars...",2,First 30 Minutes better than the rest of the Movie..[WATCH ONLY WHEN YOU ARE BORED],1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,3468,"['OK', 'was', 'movies', 'other', 'day', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'along', 'Avengers', 'who', 'got', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'BTW', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'have', 'doubt', 'movie', 'better', 'quality', 'Anyways', 'problem', 'was', 'had', 'time', 'spare', 'so', 'chose', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'horror', 'movies', 'knowledge', 'looked', 'promising', 'one', 'watch', 'mean', 'title', 'was', 'interesting', 'plot', 'premise', 'was', 'too', 'knowledge', 'Chernobyl', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'who', 'exploded', '25', 'years', 'back', 'damage', 'made', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'educating', 'movie', '*hence', 'title', 'DIARIES', 'OF', 'CHERNOBYL*', 'was', 'expecting', 'Ghosts', 'being', 'disturbed', 'dead', 'bodies', 'being', 'awaken', 'presence', 'humans', 'No..None', 'happened.The', 'film', 'started', 'out', 'nicely', 'was', 'quick', 'straight', 'point', 'group', 'tourists', 'touring', 'Europe', 'vacation', 'visiting', 'brother', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'guide', 'name', 'Paul', 'So', 'anyway', 'made', 'half', 'way', 'come', 'visit', 'Ukraine', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'idea', 'can', 'take', 'see', 'Chernobyl', 'actually', 'town', 'close', '20', 'miles', 'away', 'who', 'got', 'affected', 'explosion', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'highly', 'prohibited', 'enter', 'anyone', 'Military', 'not', 'mention', 'danger', 'getting', 'exposure', 'nuclear', 'radiation', 'still', 'looming', 'background', 'OK', 'Paul', 'good', 'intention', 'goal', 'have', 'good/adventurous', 'time', 'let', 'break', 'rules', 'once', 'be', 'ride', 'remember', 'course', 'was', 'memorable', 'ride', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'fine', 'film', 'till', 'wanted', 'get', 'small', 'town', 'theirs', 'then', 'have', 'classic', 'example', 'Horror', 'flick', 'originality', 'know', 'gon', 'eventually', 'happen', 'how', 'else', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'story', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'make', 'characters', 'trapped', 'town', 'more', 'original', 'way', 'instead', 'most', 'obvious', 'way', 'UGH', 'WHATEVER', 'Then', 'rest', 'just', 'went', 'downhill', '*monsters*', 'call', 'were', 'interesting', 'only', 'when', 'were', 'unknown', 'was', 'revealed', 'what', 'were', 'first', 'thing', 'got', 'head', 'was', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'ME', 'Honestly', 'were', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'scary', 'thought', 'were', 'gon', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'ending', 'was', 'most', 'stupid/retarded', 'intelligence', 'insulting', 'way', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'thought', 'movie', 'could', 'end.I', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'saved', 'being', '1', 'star', 'movie', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'theaters', 'know', 'BIG', 'screen', 'blazing', 'Speakers', 'actually', 'do', 'make', 'difference', 'made', 'film', 'bearable', 'well', 'even', 'suspending', 'points', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'LCD', 'TV', 'here', 'home', 'computer', 'then', 'way', ""'ll"", 'find', 'interesting.If', 'have', 'nothing', 'watch', 'mean', 'absolutely', 'NOTHING', 'then', 'recommend', 'watch', 'end', 'are', 'Better', 'Horror', 'out', 'there', 'TRUST', 'ME', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'as', 'often', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'more', 'had', 'better', 'writers', 'better', 'plot', 'certainly', 'better', 'ending', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'special', 'effects', 'lack', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'not', 'what', 'have', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'director', 'had', 'imagination.2', 'Stars']",Chernobyl Diaries

1576905,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B008VPCL7G,John's Horror Corner,"[3, 4]","The trailer looked promising, but the product delivered only disappointment.The trailer doesn't show us a whole lot in terms of estimating what kind of horror this will be.  Really, we see just enough to know that the acting isn't awful (actually it looks quite good...for a horror flick) and the production value is competitive.  I'll go so far as to say that an unusually good job was done building the plot up to the ""extreme tourism"" trip to Chernobyl.  I liked the characters (enough, at least) and enjoyed a few clever, light-hearted laughs.  Jonathan Sadowski  is charmingly funny and he brings that to the screen here early in the movie.  Characters like his are typically fun to watch things hit the fan.  Makes me think of Grave Encounters (2011), where the jokester finds himself freaking out as he learns ""it's not a joke.""  This flick also features Nathan Phillips, Ingrid Bols Berdal, Olivia Dudley, and Jesse McCartney.Though a bit prepackaged--a la Wrong Turn past the Cabin in the Woods where the Hills Have Eyes--the premise worked and the creepy setting created the opportunity for some great scenes.  Just the opportunity, though.  While the set design worked, the crux of the movie (i.e., the anthropophagous mutants), was poorly delivered.  Sadly, there are really no special effects at all in this movie.  That is not to say they are bad, but that the way the ""action"" and ""horror"" are presented no effects are really necessary.  Now, horror movies can vary.  Depending on the style they may not need any CGI or fake blood (e.g., Paranormal Activity had minimal FX).  Contrarily, movies in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre vein rely heavily on excellent make-up artists and mutant movies need solid mutant concepts that keep us from saying ""hey that's just like in that other movie with that guy in it that came out last year.""  Well, this was a mutant movie, and no one in the audience could pick one of these mutants out of a line up after seeing this movie.  That's how little you see, and the only blood/guts/whathaveyou is post-attack.  Bummer.Producer Oren Peli (Paranormal Activity director/producer; PA 2 and PA 3 producer) has a great mind for creepy suspense.  I think he was going for a monsters-driven quite creeper; the reason we never really see more than blurry silhouettes of the flesh-eating antagonists.  This general mystery tactic worked in Insidious (2010), when the creature was some other-worldly specter.  But this movie was advertised as suggestive of The Hills Have Eyes in an abandoned fallout city.  Maybe there was a way to make this work, but Peli didn't find it.I haven't really addressed the plot...there's not much to say that you don't get from watching the trailer.  Some likeable 20-somethings on a European vacation decide to take an extreme tourism excursion to a village in sight the Ukrainian power plant on record as having the worst ""bad day"" ever.  When they try to leave the car doesn't start.  Then they start dying one by one--and you never see it happen!  The escape strategy never gets anyway, the characters (not surprisingly) don't develop beyond a few cheap lines of dialogue, and there's an inexplicably stupid not-so-twisty ending.WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD?

They decide to see as much as possible, and visit Prypiat, the abandoned town next to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, despite not being permitted by the guards and knowing the dangers that may surround the radiated area. I didn't like Chernobyl Diaries, but I didn't hate it either.Chernobyl Diaries has a simple storyline, with plenty of jump-scares; yet, the jump-scares have been seen a dozen times and are often ineffective; for example, sticking your hand into something while everyone watches in suspense, then pretending to be grabbed by something. In fact, most of the scares were predictable and most of the death and action was done off-screen which leaves the film with barely any shock value. This problem probably could've been less significant if it didn't rely solely on jump-scares to frighten the audience. Honestly, there are only 2 or 3 genuinely scary scenes. The acting was okay, not great but not terrible either, although there were a couple scenes that seemed forced or overacted. I did enjoy the environment/setting of the film, it felt authentic and creepy at times. This really helped the film achieve a 2 star rating from myself, otherwise, it would've been a 1 star film. I can't comment on the music, because I honestly don't remember hearing any at all, which is disappointing because I love horror soundtracks.Ultimately, Chernobyl Diaries fails as a horror film, especially for die-hard horror fans that have seen this film dozens of times before without actually watching it, but the chilling environment and the 2, or so, decent scares save the film from a terrible 1 star rating.

The plot set-up is simple enough: four (or, it ends up 6) young tourists from the US and Western European countries are traveling around on the cheap, and end up deciding to take an &#34;extreme tourist&#34; trip to the deserted town of Pripyat, not far from the Chernobyl nuclear reactors.  Their tour guide is a former Russian special forces member who, after leaving the service, has set up this one-man tour guide business.  Naturally, in the story the radiation has caused mutations of life in the area, and the whole trip ends up far from fun.  Use is made of the usual conventions of horror movies: the shocks that are only teasers before the really scary stuff begins; a progressively worsening revelation of the dangers involved; people who behave like idiots, running around defenseless in the dark yelling for each other and waving flashlights for example; and lastly the oldest scare tactic in the book--the darkness itself.  A few things made me like this modest film.  The Russian guy looked and sounded credibly like an ex-special-forces Russian.  The scenes of abandonded Pripyat, and of Chernobyl in the distance, looked very credible [in fact, some &#34;stock&#34; photos of Pripyat and Chernobyl actually were incorporated into the movie].  Lastly recent events make this somehow seem even more relevant: the Fukushima Daiichi disaster which in the long run may prove worse than Chernobyl, and the Russian takeover of Crimea suddenly reminds the rest of us geographically impaired: oh yeah, Chernobyl is actually in the Ukraine, not what is now Russia.  In fact our young tourists are first seen in Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine.  Overall it's not a bad horror movie.

That was because I stupidly thought they had shot in and around Pripyat. Anyone who knows a fair bit about the real story will immediately realise the actors are not in Pripyat, though props have been built (such as the ferris wheel) to help add to the realism. The street lights were the dead giveaway for me. They are completely different to those still standing in Pripyat. At least they managed to find some derelict buildings of a similar style in Serbia or Hungary where it was actually shot.My review is not to pass judgment on the qualities of the script from a horror genre point-of-view.

1576927,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B008VPCL7G,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","I found this film watchable, but it is really a thing to see once. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.Four young American tourists travelling through Europe and on their way to Moscow decide to go on an one-day ""extreme tourism"" expedition to the abandoned city of Pripyat in Ukraine, inside the irradiated restricted access zone around Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The four Americans are:- a very average and rather boring guy named Chris (Jesse McCartney)- his brother Paul (Jonathan Sadowski), a not very bright and always-in-trouble kind of dude- Natalie (Olivia Taylor Dudley), currently dating Chris, a tall blonde with average face but big breasts- Amanda (Devin Kelley), Natalie's BFF, with less breasts but still the hottest girl in the filmFor the Pripyat visit Americans are joined by two backpacking students:- Zoe (Ingrid Bols Berdal), a tall Norwegian blonde with pretty face and big breasts- Michael (Nathan Phillips), an annoying Australian hippie, who somehow managed to become Zoe's boyfriend...Their guide and ""tour organiser"" is a middle-aged, rough, tough, buff and gruff but ultimately rather likeable former Soviet soldier Yuri (Dimitri Diachenko). Yuri used to be in Soviet Special Forces and still carries a gun, stays in shape and remains in touch with some of his old pals. He certainly cares for the safety of ""his"" tourists and tries to give them their money worth. He can also drive his old mini-bus almost everywhere and knows every ruin, tree and bush in the restricted access zone. Last but not least, he is also the ONLY character whose fate concerned me in the least...Well, because it is ""this kind"" of film, you may think that the visit to Pripyat will not be exactly what Yuri and the tourists planned - and you would be right... You can also safely assume that some people (and some breasts) will not make it until the final credits.Now, this is not exactly a bad film and I spend a rather pleasant 90 minutes watching it - actually, some scenes were even not bad - and some others were even NOT BAD AT ALL... There are some surprises, there are even some (short) moments when things get scary and towards the end this film even gets rather original. The scenario is certainly not a masterpiece, but the absolutely unique place of action certainly helps a lot - and it helps REALLY A LOT especially during the last 10 minutes...Amongst the reasons to watch this film is certainly the possibility to later read and fully understand some of the very funny internet discussions concerning ""Chernobyl Diaries"". I personally recommend to check on IMDB page the thread called ""Things you learn from watching Chernobyl Diaries"" - it cheered me up no end...)))PRECISION: Possession of a Geiger counter is not a required condition to see this film and neither is the possession of a fully functional brain - in fact, this film is more enjoyable if you have at least three strong beers in the system...CONCLUSION: this is not a very good film, but if approached with not so high expectations it can be entertaining. However, my advice is to RENT, not to buy, as this is a thing to see once and hard to sell later.",3,"A honest, average horror film, with unknown actors, two good pairs of breasts, one Yuri and a quite unique place of action",1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,3159,"['found', 'film', 'watchable', 'really', 'thing', 'see', 'once', 'more', 'impressions', 'SPOILERS.Four', 'young', 'American', 'tourists', 'travelling', 'Europe', 'way', 'Moscow', 'decide', 'go', 'one-day', 'extreme', 'tourism', 'expedition', 'abandoned', 'city', 'Pripyat', 'Ukraine', 'irradiated', 'restricted', 'access', 'zone', 'Chernobyl', 'Nuclear', 'Power', 'Plant', 'four', 'Americans', 'are', 'very', 'average', 'rather', 'boring', 'guy', 'named', 'Chris', 'Jesse', 'McCartney', 'brother', 'Paul', 'Jonathan', 'Sadowski', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'always-in-trouble', 'kind', 'dude-', 'Natalie', 'Olivia', 'Taylor', 'Dudley', 'currently', 'dating', 'Chris', 'tall', 'blonde', 'average', 'face', 'big', 'breasts-', 'Amanda', 'Devin', 'Kelley', 'Natalie', 'BFF', 'less', 'breasts', 'still', 'hottest', 'girl', 'filmFor', 'Pripyat', 'visit', 'Americans', 'are', 'joined', 'two', 'backpacking', 'students', 'Zoe', 'Ingrid', 'Bols', 'Berdal', 'tall', 'Norwegian', 'blonde', 'pretty', 'face', 'big', 'breasts-', 'Michael', 'Nathan', 'Phillips', 'annoying', 'Australian', 'hippie', 'who', 'somehow', 'managed', 'become', 'Zoe', 'boyfriend', 'Their', 'guide', 'tour', 'organiser', 'middle-aged', 'rough', 'tough', 'buff', 'gruff', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'likeable', 'former', 'Soviet', 'soldier', 'Yuri', 'Dimitri', 'Diachenko', 'Yuri', 'used', 'be', 'Soviet', 'Special', 'Forces', 'still', 'gun', 'shape', 'touch', 'old', 'pals', 'certainly', 'safety', 'tourists', 'tries', 'give', 'money', 'worth', 'can', 'also', 'drive', 'old', 'mini-bus', 'almost', 'everywhere', 'ruin', 'tree', 'bush', 'restricted', 'access', 'zone', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'also', 'ONLY', 'character', 'fate', 'concerned', 'least', 'Well', 'kind', 'film', 'may', 'think', 'visit', 'Pripyat', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'Yuri', 'tourists', 'planned', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'can', 'also', 'safely', 'assume', 'people', 'breasts', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'final', 'credits.Now', 'not', 'exactly', 'bad', 'film', 'spend', 'rather', 'pleasant', '90', 'minutes', 'watching', 'actually', 'scenes', 'were', 'even', 'not', 'bad', 'others', 'were', 'even', 'NOT', 'BAD', 'AT', 'ALL', 'are', 'surprises', 'are', 'even', 'short', 'moments', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'scary', 'end', 'film', 'even', 'rather', 'original', 'scenario', 'certainly', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'absolutely', 'unique', 'place', 'action', 'certainly', 'lot', 'REALLY', 'A', 'LOT', 'especially', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'Amongst', 'reasons', 'watch', 'film', 'certainly', 'possibility', 'later', 'read', 'fully', 'understand', 'very', 'funny', 'internet', 'discussions', 'concerning', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'personally', 'recommend', 'check', 'IMDB', 'page', 'thread', 'called', 'Things', 'learn', 'watching', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'cheered', 'end', 'PRECISION', 'Possession', 'Geiger', 'counter', 'not', 'required', 'condition', 'see', 'film', 'possession', 'fully', 'functional', 'brain', 'fact', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'least', 'three', 'strong', 'beers', 'system', 'CONCLUSION', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'approached', 'not', 'so', 'high', 'expectations', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'However', 'advice', 'RENT', 'not', 'buy', 'thing', 'see', 'once', 'hard', 'sell', 'later']",Chernobyl Diaries

Six young folks take an &#34;extreme tour&#34; from an ex-Special Forces Russian, who leads them around the abandoned complex of Chernobyl, an area of the Ukraine that was left in haste after a major nuclear disaster rendered the area unlivable. There's still a lot of radiation floating around in various lethal pockets, but the levels are low enough overall to allow the occasional tour group to come in and poke around at the lifeless desolation.Well ... not totally lifeless.Yup! Turns out the moral of the story is: don't take tours in radioactive wastelands. This, because there is a malevolent force nearby that begins to terrorize our group.There's not a whole lot of the movie that works all that well, unfortunately. The second half of the film has a good sense of pace in spite of its repetition. The actors do pretty good jobs. The movie even is quite deft with its spookier elements (rabid dogs, evidence of past atrocities, claustrophobia, glimpsed monsters), considering that it obviously didn't have a very large budget.The biggest problem, though, is the unimaginative script, unremarkable characters, and predictable plot.The dialogue is pretty routine and gets grating after awhile. This includes characters stopping every fifteen minutes to argue over whose fault it is that they're all going to die. This also includes the obligatory mental breakdown of at least one character who demands that the others go back for someone who is clearly already dead. There are other moments like this, all of them evidence of a scriptwriter who confuses running in place with character development.Speaking of which, the first half of the movie has fairly decent character development, but it also feels overlong given that audiences are all well aware of what's going to happen once our group hits the Chernobyl complex (especially if you've given the trailer a looksee). Making matters worse, the characters are all pretty much interchangeable. None of them are all that remarkable or unique, making it hard to tell them apart sometimes. (I got the two blondes confused for most of the movie.)Finally, the movie's horror is basically the same thing happening over and over and over again (often at the expense of logic). It's not so bad since the director obviously knew how to ratchet up the tension and speed as the film progressed. Although it gets a bit dizzying and repetitive, it also keeps amplifying, which at least makes it feel like something is getting done. The problem is that it's pretty easy to predict where everything will end up, generally speaking. The film does include a tiny little twist at the end, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense and it also hardly seems necessary, given how few questions it answers.",2,Toxic Waste,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,2922,"['derivative', 'horror', 'film', 'well-shot', 'acted', 'suffers', 'lack', 'originality', 'plot', 'held', 'together', 'mostly', 'holes.The', 'basic', 'concept', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Six', 'young', 'folks', 'take', '34', 'extreme', 'tour', '34', 'ex-Special', 'Forces', 'Russian', 'who', 'around', 'abandoned', 'complex', 'Chernobyl', 'area', 'Ukraine', 'was', 'left', 'haste', 'major', 'nuclear', 'disaster', 'rendered', 'area', 'unlivable', 'still', 'lot', 'radiation', 'floating', 'around', 'various', 'lethal', 'pockets', 'levels', 'are', 'low', 'enough', 'overall', 'allow', 'occasional', 'tour', 'group', 'come', 'poke', 'around', 'lifeless', 'desolation.Well', 'not', 'totally', 'lifeless.Yup', 'out', 'moral', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'tours', 'radioactive', 'wastelands', 'malevolent', 'force', 'nearby', 'terrorize', 'group.There', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'movie', 'well', 'unfortunately', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'good', 'sense', 'pace', 'spite', 'repetition', 'actors', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'jobs', 'movie', 'even', 'quite', 'deft', 'spookier', 'elements', 'rabid', 'dogs', 'evidence', 'past', 'atrocities', 'claustrophobia', 'glimpsed', 'monsters', 'considering', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'large', 'budget.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'though', 'unimaginative', 'script', 'unremarkable', 'characters', 'predictable', 'plot.The', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'routine', 'grating', 'awhile', 'characters', 'stopping', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'argue', 'fault', ""'re"", 'going', 'die', 'also', 'obligatory', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'least', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'others', 'go', 'back', 'someone', 'who', 'clearly', 'already', 'dead', 'are', 'other', 'moments', 'evidence', 'scriptwriter', 'who', 'running', 'place', 'character', 'development.Speaking', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'fairly', 'decent', 'character', 'development', 'also', 'overlong', 'given', 'audiences', 'are', 'well', 'aware', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'once', 'group', 'Chernobyl', 'complex', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'given', 'trailer', 'looksee', 'Making', 'matters', 'worse', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'interchangeable', 'None', 'are', 'remarkable', 'unique', 'making', 'hard', 'tell', 'apart', 'sometimes', 'got', 'two', 'blondes', 'confused', 'most', 'movie', 'Finally', 'movie', 'horror', 'basically', 'same', 'thing', 'happening', 'over', 'again', 'often', 'expense', 'logic', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'director', 'obviously', 'knew', 'how', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'speed', 'film', 'progressed', 'bit', 'dizzying', 'repetitive', 'also', 'amplifying', 'least', 'feel', 'something', 'getting', 'done', 'problem', 'pretty', 'easy', 'predict', 'where', 'everything', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'generally', 'speaking', 'film', 'include', 'tiny', 'little', 'twist', 'end', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'sense', 'also', 'hardly', 'necessary', 'given', 'how', 'few', 'questions']",Chernobyl Diaries

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","I've been enthralled by the concept behind ""Chernobyl Diaries"" since Elena Filatova created an online photo-essay in 2004 of the post-apocalyptic wilderness in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The abandoned city of Pripyat figured prominently, a spooky ghost town that was frozen in time. This led to a rise in ""Chernobyl Stalking,"" a type of adventure tourism. In 2007 the PC game, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, which populates the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone with all manner of mutants and monsters.  And that brings us to ""Chernobyl Diaries,"" in which four Americans are touring Europe:  Chris (Jesse McCartney), his girlfriend Natalie (Olivia Taylor Dudley, sporting more FX on her chest than the entire film's budget), third-wheel Amanda (Devin Kelley), and Chris' ker-raaaazy brother Paul (Jonathan Sadowski).Paul is the black sheep of the family, which is why he's in Kiev.  When Chris leaks to his brother that he plans to propose to his girlfriend in Moscow, still-single Paul has other ideas.  They're going to take an extreme tour of Pripyat. Never mind that Chernobyl is now officially open to tourists--""Chernobyl Diaries"" is for Americans who weren't even born when the tragedy happened.  It evokes paranoia about traveling to European countries, mutation-causing radiation, and an inherent fear of nuclear reactors.A European backpacking couple (Zoe (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) and Michael (Nathan Phillips)) joins the ill-fated quartet on the tour, led by ex-special forces guide Uri (Dimitri Diatchenko). The tragedy that is Chernobyl sinks in before things go sideways.""Chernobyl Diaries"" was written and produced by Oren Peli, master of the ""found footage"" horror style in vogue thanks to his ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise.  That explains why ""Chernobyl Diaries"" is surprisingly subtle for a mutant-attack film.  The mutants are never seen--Peli's working with a million-dollar budget after all--but he makes effective use of regular dogs, creepy children, and the incessant ticking of a Geiger counter.  This isn't typical of survival horror flicks, which will disappoint fans looking for mutant mayhem.The biggest problem with ""Chernobyl Diaries"" is the cast. Talented McCartney has little to do and has zero chemistry with tittering arm-candy Dudley.  Kelley, who looks the part of a Final Girl, ends up playing second fiddle to Sadowski, and he mostly whines his way through the film.

The few shadows on ghosts were too blurred and too brief to distract the attention of the viewer by how the moviemaker would perceive ghosts. Thus, it was quite easier to imagine that the victims of the terror attacks were gripped by horror and hallucination to the extent that they mixed up between wild animals and shadows of ghosts.Inside the reactor control rooms, one gets a somber sense of the magnitude of Chernobyl catastrophe with the massive and endless control panels and hardware harnessed by humans to manage the nuclear reactors that went wrong. A great technological marvel turned into an abandoned jungle run by wild vicious beasts and ghosts.After two long hours of gripping terror and tension, the last two survivals had to be eliminated by the plant security guards. One got shot alive, the other got locked into a concrete, dark room, surrounded by ghosts and monsters.The ordeal of the six American victims played a secondary role in depicting the utter chaos created by Chernobyl's disaster.Mohamed F.

1576944,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B008VPCL7G,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[1, 2]","Some of the more sensitive American critics found the setting of Brad Parker's new film at the site of a cataclysmic nuclear accident in poor taste. I didn't: I thought it was inspired.Despite its title The Chernobyl Diaries is actually about Pripyat, the neighbouring worker's village, which was evacuated overnight in 1986 and has been cordoned off ever since. For most of the picture Chernobyl only glowers in the distance. It has a cameo at the conclusion.Nonetheless, the location is terrific. Parker has managed to find, deep in Serbia and Hungary, a set spookily reminiscent of the real Pripyat, possibly another long-abandoned Communist power plant. It looks fantastic: dripping, derelict; full of burnt out cars, dilapidated industrial machinery, blown out plaster, rags of browned wallpaper and everything riddled with spindly, sickly looking vegetation, slowly reclaiming a once Ozymandial site. A wonderful metaphor for human hubris, it is badly wasted on this film's unimaginative screenplay.That is to say, it isn't the location that is tasteless: it is the rest of the film. In genre The Chernobyl Diaries sits somewhere betweenThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre,The Blair Witch Project, and Elizabeth Olsen's recentSilent House. However it is only rated 15. This could have been a fascinating, harrowing thriller, or even just a drama. But it's a claw-free slasher.No matter. This low-tensile horror has few of Chainsaw's ... er, chops; little of the downright terror of Blair Witch, but much of Silent House's panicked breathing, flashlight-toting and cleavage lionising. Natalie (Olivia Dudley) appears to be in the film only to provide a pendulous canyon for Morten Sborg's camera to ogle.There is not even one diary, let alone enough of them to justify the plural of this film's title. Indeed, the potential for suspense is largely disarmed because, for the most part, we watch the protagonists through a dissociated third-party camera and not their own video footage (as was the case in The Blair Witch Project). The sense that these poor innocent kids are alone is somewhat compromised by the implied existence of a camera crew.In any case, The Chernobyl Diaries exclusively concerns individuals whom you quickly wish to meet grisly ends. What is meant to pass as suspense plays thus more like delayed gratification.Chris (Jesse McCartney) is a clean-cut American student, touring Europe with his girlfriend (Dudley) and her buddy Amanda (Devin Kelley, the only character in the film with whom it is easy to empathise). Establishing shots show them unlikeably skylarking around the continent. They visit Chris' brother, Paul (Jonathan Sadowski), a student resident in Kiev, who is far worse. You immediately wish someone would punch him in his smug face, and in early exchanges, some local Kiev heavies nearly do. Opportunity missed.Paul has arranged an ""extreme tourism"" outing with local everyman Uri (Dimitri Diatchenko) to Pripyat. It is, apparently, dead: nothing can live there.I bet you can tell where this is going.The others are reluctant, but agree. Without explanation they are joined by Michael (Nathan Phillips), an Australian whose role seems to be to make us like Paul better, because he is so irritating you even want Paul to punch him in the face, and his European girlfriend Zoe (Ingrid Bols Berdal), whom, like Dudley, is transparently in the picture only as ghoulbait.The womenfolk are essentially passengers in what follows.I won't spoil it. In its way, it is deftly done: the action is nicely implied with shaky handhelds, intermittent light and creative use of darkness. It is amazing how much mood you can summon by not filming anything. Parker could have summoned more had he elected to use incidental music, but (perhaps to maintain the Blair Witch vibe) for much of the film there was none.As a result, The Chernobyl Diaries struggles to maintain any tension. There are stretches where the kids' exploration of the underground tunnels is tedious. Some passages actually do provide an opportunity to watch wallpaper peeling. Periodically, radioactive dogs show up to chase everyone for a bit, but never get close enough to cause cause much concern.As seems compulsory these days, none of our protagonists have a shred of common sense when it comes to knowing when to run away and when not to bolt ignorantly into dark underground bunkers which are populated by mutant freaks (fair enough first time, but on your fourth go-round you'd think you'd learn your lesson).But this makes it all the more frustrating that it takes them so long to get what's coming to them.Olly Buxton(Flickfeast)",3,Fission

Since then we have had a plethora of movies all done on a budget with that fast,in your face,home video,quick cuts from here to there stuff,a loose roaming camera,all with various results.Most have been nothing of import,just poor imitations.Chernobyl Diaries takes that same feel,along with a Cloverfield style,and brings it to the foreboding lands around the Chernobyl nuclear plant,specifically Prypiat.I found it to be better than I expected,but still nothing to write home about.The story finds a group of happy go lucky young American tourists(aren't they all before it all goes south?),traveling across Europe,to meet up with one the of groups brother in Kiev.They land at his place,who intends to take them to Moscow,but has arranged an extreme tourist guide to take them into the dead zone around the Chernobyl plant;specifically the town of Prypiat.This is the town where the workers were all housed that worked in the plant and who were evacuated literally overnight when disaster struck in 1986.They arrive at the tour guides place of business,one Yuri,an ex Soviet special forces man,where they also are joined by a couple of Australian tourists who are back packing.This group all pile into his old van and off to Prypiat they go.At a Soviet checkpoint they are turned back,but Yuri knows another way in through a back road.They take this and before you can say ""meltdown"",they arrive in the workers town.They are parked near some apartments and they do a walkabout around and through some of them.In all these types of films there is a catalyst as to the reason they get into trouble,which usually comes swiftly.And that moment here is when the group return to the van and it won't start.Somebody or something has wrecked a distributor cap and wires.They are stranded now and try as Yuri can,he can't get the van fixed.Night falls and they hear a noise.Yuri and one of the brothers investigate.Yuri is killed and the brother barely makes it back alive.It's a tense night and next day four of the others decide to try and hike out.Along the way they find a group of abandoned vehicles which yields them a distributor cap.When they get back to the van it has been overturned and its occupants gone.From here the remainder of the group find themselves in darkness once more and are running for their lives through the underground areas of the buildings.A small Geiger counter that was Yuri's tells them that the radiation level is getting ever higher.At this point there are only two remaining and the one guy cannot see.They finally reach open air only to be confronted by soldiers.It seems they got completely turned around and ended up at the plant itself.The guy is told in Russian to stay,but pretty much blind and unable to understand,he ends up being shot dead.The remaining girl is taken into custody and is presumably going to be treated.But she is locked in a cell where she is soon surrounded by beings much like those encountered in Prypiat.Her screams end the film.Of course you cannot look too closely at the ""plot"" of a film like this,because the holes are like Swiss cheese.As in,why,when they got back to the van with Yuri and they immediately discovered the wires were tampered with,did they not hike out in daylight? But that would have ended the film right there,right? One incident that didn't come off as well as I am sure the film makers would have wanted,was the bear scene.While looking in one of the apartment buildings,a big bear comes lumbering down the hallway,right past them all.It was a tad too obvious that the bear was tame and just going into camera view then out of it,to its trainer.However they all acted,of course,like they had comethisclose to being the bears snacks,but the bear's body language gave it all away.I have played both video games of Prypiat and I saw here many scenes out of that game that had been seemingly re-created,yet there are no credits to that effect.The film makers DID seamlessly blend their  location shooting in Hungary and Serbia with stock footage shots of Prypiat.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a deleted scene and a well known You Tube vid about 3 minutes long on the Chernobyl disaster.All in all another Blair Witch/Cloverfield styled film in which a group of young tourists end up stranded in Prypiat,Ukraine,and have the experience of their very shortened lives.3 stars.",3,Blair Witch Project meets Chernobyl!,1352592000,"11 11,

That's like saying a zombie apocalypse that was filmed in Gettysburg is based on a true story just because it takes place in Gettysburg which just happens to be a real place, for example.  Get real!  Now come the spoilers.  To begin and end with, there is nothing--absolutely nothing--even remotely original about this movie.  Every clich&eacute;', from the fake anticipation of danger followed by the real thing, to the cannibal theme is mined to no great depth.  Ok, there is one scene, which would do Shakespeare proud:  our principals really DO exit out of a scene pursued by a bear.  Other than this unintentionally hilarious Scooby moment, it is non-stop stupidity.  The crowner is when one of the main characters spends the whole film swaggering around speaking his Russian and then ends up begging for his life in front of the local army in English.  Their guide has been doing this ""tour"" for 5 years and doesn't even suspect anything dangerous?  And why is the movie entitled ""diary"" when the format is not found footage, and there is nothing even remotely resembling a chronicle of any kind.  Not very surprisingly, the ending is also illogical junk.  There are far superior movies of this ilk out there such as The Descent and even C.H.U.D.

We watched it together and I was left disappointed.  While the plot certainly left room for what could have been a truly scary movie, the actual film left much to be desired.There were only a handful of suspenseful scenes that you want in a horror flick.  And as far as the ""bad guys"", you really never get a good look at them.

They enter Chernobyl, a creepy and original setting that gets us on edge along with some great jump scares. Having said that, the film has huge potential, we can tell that even by the trailer alone.I will agree with many people who say the second half is a letdown and could have been much much better. It is set up perfectly but really does nothing with it. The plot becomes a blur and there's no twist that the film really needs.

O'Sullivan,"[0, 0]","Actually, when this film (finally, thankfully) ended I stopped for a moment to think back on the title...CHERNOBYL DIARIES; exactly where was this diary at?  This hybrid ""in camera"", traditional feature film had nothing to do with any diary at all.  Like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and many other found footage films, they're supposed to act as a ""diary"" of events to temp us with what did or did not happen...here, in CHERNOBYL DIARIES, nothing.  We saw what happened and then we saw what didn't happen.  People disappear into the night with screams, cries and gunfire and we only learn about what may have truly happened from handheld camera phones that are so well directed and edited as to make them look like a horror film...wait, this was supposed to be a horror film.I'm not sure exactly what was the idea here, much less the point of this film - it seems like they gave the writer/director some cash and told him to work his usual magic, but make it a real movie too, so he ended up trying to fuse together two styles into one and neither sit well with the other (imagine Ridley Scott being told he had to do one, final, last edit of BLADE RUNNER and he had to use his ""final cut"" and the original theatrical release in the same movie - jarring).  The cast is bland, their performances feel purely weekend theater workshop (every emotion is played HUGE and when it's time to confront some real feelings they smother it with foul language).  The film has no hero, no heronine, the monsters we know right from the start and their actions so well-trodden that their path is very clear.  The body count feels like you're losing people to a boring party than any true horror.  For a moment I thought we were going to get a PROPHECY (1979) reboot and the monsters would turn out to be mutant bears - I was misled here with all the comments repeated early in the film about ""nature having taken over""; I thought for sure if it wasn't mutant animals then it might be hostile weeds...which would have been better than just a mutant goon squad.  The film wants to be a commentary, it wants to be a horror film, it wants to a hand held, found footage film, it wants to be SCOOBY DOO in THE WORST WAY (seriously, when everyone was trapped in the Russian MYSTERY MACHINE I could not stop laughing), but it ends up being none of these things.The city does have some effective creepy corners to explore, but overall it feels like a DLC map for HALO 4 or MEDAL OF HONOR or better yet, GOLDENEYE.

A group of friends are traveling through Europe in what looks like a shot for shot remake of Hostel, when they meet a man who gives tours of the abandon city near Chernobyl. After being rejected entry into the city, the group sneaks in and runs into a whole mess of trouble. This is your very basic zombie film, with nothing extraordinary about it. You've seen this story a hundred times, but what makes Chernobyl Diaries different is that it takes place in Russia and features a talent cast. What's interesting about this cast is that none of them have any background in horror. Jesse McCartney is a singer who does mostly voice over work, and Devin Kelley is almost strictly a TV actress. Taking these role was something new for them and they really put all they had into it. I feel like it was wasted effort though, as this film really is nothing different. Friends on vacation go to a unique location and run into something supernatural that tries to kill them, it's been done over and over again.

The biggest problem I had with it is that it didn't really know if it wanted to be a real movie or a ""found footage"" type movie. The movie was filmed like the ""found footage"" in the way that you only get one point of view the entire time and was like you were there. Unlike most movies like this though no one in the group has a camera so it wasn't a true found footage movie. Another huge problem (for me at least) was that the scary parts made me laugh a little. *spoiler* During a tense scene a huge bear comes running out of nowhere. This is another horror movie really geared toward teens. Not much of a plot and just a bunch of ""stomach-jumper"" scenes to make them spill thier popcorn. Overall, entertaining but not scary.

Everyone was laughing at the parts that were supposed to be scary, everyone was criticizing how stupid the plot was and how dumb the characters were being.If you're looking for a scary movie, DO NOT watch this.

And the guy agrees to this?Plus they tell NO ONE where they are going, the military tells them to turn back because it's dangerous, but they still wanna go in anyways?On top of that I would really like for Hollywood to stop using radiation as a plot device that can just do anything the movie needs it to? Radiation can apparently mutate fish into killer monster piranha, turn people into monsters, give them night vision and make them immune to further radiation poisoning? Sure, let's just throw all we know about radiation right out the window because the plot says so.Another thing that's stupid is that their van breaks down and they have to spend the night in Chernobyl. We know whatever is there doesn't like sunlight, so they're active at night. They hear something outside and it turns into an episode of Scooby-Doo. ""Hey, what was that noise outside? Let's split up gang!"" Seriously, they were almost attacked by a bear, they KNOW it's dangerous outside, why not just stay inside your van where you have some semblance of protection. Then as soon as the sun peaks over the horizon, you start walking. They stated it's 20 kilometers to the nearest guard station, you could walk that before it gets dark again. I mean, you would live if you did that. Then again I guess that would make too much sense.Also I want you to think about this, if you were in a dangerous area, there are things outside that want to kill you, your significant other has had his leg mauled, and you might not live throughout the night, would you really turn on your cell phone camera to record the two of you chit-chatting? Seriously what are you going to do with that footage? Upload it to Facebook or YouTube? Then again I guess that wouldn't help to advance the plot.Another thing, I don't care how many of these radiation poisoned guys you get together, you're not going to have enough strength to knock a 2 ton van over and move it roughly a block and a half.What's worse is that you never really SEE the monsters. This worked for Cloverfield, you never see the monster clearly until the last 5 minutes of the movie, so there's a pay off. In this movie you just see flashes of things that look human with some discolored patches on their skin. I was staring at the screen squinting and at the end of the movie I was scratching my head and thinking, ""what the hell did I just watch?""Okay one last thing and I'll wrap this up. Two of the characters end up near reactor number 4 where the disaster happened and the radiation is the worst and the Russian military shows up and kills one of the last survivors. They take the last survivor, the brunette girl and they talk in Russian so she can't understand them. They say they can't let her go because, ""She's seen them!"" So they put her in a room with the mutated people and they eat her. Ummm... if you were going to do that all along, why didn't you just shoot her like you did the other guy? Save time and just put a 50 cent bullet in her skull and leave her inside the contaminated area and let the mutated people eat the remains.***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS***So I went hoping to get something awesome, but all I got was a remake of the Hills Have Eyes set in Russia.
