With just a few days away from Halloween, you don't have many opportunities to watch this classic Halloween episode. Since October of 1985, this episode has been a Halloween tradition in my family. Like watching John Carpenter's Halloween 1, 2 and 4, this show is part of that yearly tradition. Best line...

It's a little before my time but I grew up watching reruns and now the SyFy channel has brought it back. Thank God for that! But what's even better is that they're releasing it on DVD! If you love The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, Night Gallery...etc. You LOVE Tales From The Darkside. And season 2 is just as eerie, creepy and awesome.

I thought  out of all the seasons, the second is the best, I notice when the SyFy channel carries it they usually air the ones from the second season, I don't know if it's just ransomly done, or if it's planned but before I purchased the DVD's I would try to catch the SyFy airing; because I love the series so much. I thought the DVD's were done well considering it's an old series, the DVD's were clear, cut well, and the layout is great.Thank You,-Kris L.

1268613,A29HVOSR9VLFKP,B002HK9HZU,Mike  Silverman,"[6, 10]","By today's production standards ( or even by the production standards of its own time in the 1980's), this series doesn't cut it. George Romero who produced this series seems to handle it like an adolescent joke.  If you want something similar, a horror-mystery anthology with twist endings that does a much much better job of it, I'd suggest sticking with Night Gallery or Twlilight Zone or Alfred Hitchcock Presents. At least those series crafted the presentation of their material seriously. There ""are"" a few episodes on this disk set that are worth a look.  ""Devil's Advocate"" is a hilarious over-the-top satire of Talk Radio. ""Parlour Floor Front"" is fairly good, a mean spirited woman gets cursed by a voodoo practitioner. Overall about ten episodes out of the 24 episodes are entertaining enough to watch, but that's less than half of them. Having some big name actors in the series helped it a little by having some decent acting. But most of the effects are ultra cheesey, and the sets look cheaply built.  The disk comes with a ""special feature"" , which is a commentary track by George Romero about one of the episodes.  I listed to it, and ... it's not worth the price. Just a lot of silly rambling and whining about political issues. Go ahead and buy it if you really want to, but only if you can get it at a VERY low price.  The disks worked well, audio and video were very clean and clear.- Mike S.",2,WORTH A LOOK,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,1413,"['today', 'production', 'standards', 'even', 'production', 'standards', 'own', 'time', '1980', 'series', ""n't"", 'cut', 'George', 'Romero', 'who', 'produced', 'series', 'handle', 'adolescent', 'joke', 'want', 'something', 'similar', 'horror-mystery', 'anthology', 'twist', 'endings', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'job', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'sticking', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'Twlilight', 'Zone', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Presents', 'least', 'series', 'crafted', 'presentation', 'material', 'seriously', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'disk', 'set', 'are', 'look', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'hilarious', 'over-the-top', 'satire', 'Talk', 'Radio', 'Parlour', 'Floor', 'Front', 'fairly', 'good', 'mean', 'spirited', 'woman', 'cursed', 'voodoo', 'practitioner', 'Overall', 'ten', '24', 'episodes', 'are', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'watch', 'less', 'half', 'Having', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'series', 'helped', 'little', 'having', 'decent', 'acting', 'most', 'effects', 'are', 'ultra', 'cheesey', 'sets', 'look', 'cheaply', 'built', 'disk', 'special', 'feature', 'commentary', 'track', 'George', 'Romero', 'one', 'episodes', 'listed', 'not', 'worth', 'price', 'Just', 'lot', 'silly', 'rambling', 'whining', 'about', 'political', 'issues', 'Go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'really', 'want', 'only', 'can', 'get', 'VERY', 'low', 'price', 'disks', 'worked', 'well', 'audio', 'video', 'were', 'very', 'clean', 'clear.-', 'Mike', 'S']",N/A
1268614,A2QXH2TWDMPEH2,B002HK9HZU,Schroeder (Cult Movies Magazine),"[27, 41]","First off, my original review was deleted. Why? I don't know. All I can say is DO NOT SUPPORT or BUY season 2 until Paramount releases this series with its ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS/SCORES!!! Season one was butchered with new music added to each & every episode so if you are a ""TRUE FAN"" of the series,... YOU WILL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE! I refused to watch any further episodes on season one after the 3rd episode. I recall the original scores of EVERY episode & scores are what make some scenes memorable, i was thoroughly disgusted & angered! Ok Paramount, why don't you re-release the classic 70's musical flick ""GREASE"" & re-dub all the music & scores, you would have TONS of fans screaming at you to stick to the original soundtrack & yet you seem to think that horror fans will not notice the UNSUBTLE music scores you have replaced in 12 episodes of season 2. I will not buy this series until it is released in its ORIGINAL RELEASE!! I urge you ""TRUE FANS"" to not purchase this garbage until Paramount decides to release this series with its ORIGINAL music scores. Do not encourage Paramount to release any further seasons of Tales From The Darkside by purchasing this junk! Write Paramount & DEMAND the original shows & not this garbage. If you are a TRUE FAN of this series you will not support the poor judgement Paramount has made on these 12 episodes (regarding score/tracks). This trash gets 2 bloody thumbs down, poor judgement on Paramount's behalf & who ever was involved with this release, disgraceful.
