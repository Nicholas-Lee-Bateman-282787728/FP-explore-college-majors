I was expecting a one-star dud like the idiotic ""Fear Dot Com"" (a total waste of time) and instead I discovered a film that was actually infused with real emotion and genuine drama and a story filled with clever twists and believable plot action. There were one or two seemingly staged scenes (for example when Adam's wife is walking down the middle of a street with a car creeping directly behind her; what rational person would do this at night and not worry about being run over??) but aside from these, it was a cleverly written thrill-ride that sounds all-too-plausible in today's world of cyber-freaks.

769356,AQ2UN38CMK119,B0000AZT4D,P. Mann,"[2, 3]","Adam Vance (C. Thomas Howell) has a problem. His wife (Monique Demers, whom you may have seen on in-flight United Airlines travel shows) is recovering from rape and is not as amorous as Adam would like. Adam's friend recommends an online site notable for its risqu&eacute; chat rooms. Thus begins Adam's descent into aFatal Attractionfor the Internet age. The plot is both as simple as that and far more complex; sadly, though, the complexities don't make much sense.Angel (Lara Sloatman,Amityville - New Generation,Pauly Shore Is Dead) is the woman whom Adam meets in the chat room, and they are soon engaging in, ahem, candid chats. (These chats are more amusing than bawdy as the characters speak their lines, hit a few keys, and then speak the next line. I understand the presumed need for the characters to talk, but still, I am not speaking as I type this. Perhapsspeech recognition softwarewould have been a good idea in the film.) When Angel becomes too aggressive for Adam, he tries to call off their fiber-optic relationship. Too late, though.The primary problem with the movie is the number of implausibilities and absurdities the viewer must accept. For instance, on the night that was to be Adam and Angel's first telephone ""date,"" he has to go out with his employers to celebrate a big contract. No problem there, but Angel calls repeatedly (apparently 24 times), and we see her rather upset in her home. Later, though, we learn that she must have been following him at the same time. At another point, Adam and his best friend do something very stupid when they find a body and decide to bury it. Later, however, it turns out that they must have been followed to the remote location even though I'm sure that if I were ever burying a body, the one thing I would make absolutely sure of as I drove to the burial site is that I was not being followed.There is also the issue of Adam's wife, Jennifer. Remember, her inability to be romantic is the premise that sends Adam scurrying for the depths of cyberspace. Later, however, she demonstrates a personality change so dramatic that it is laughable. Angel, for her part, is clearly unbalanced, yet she lives in a house that is almost palatial. Though serial killers are, I suppose, good at hiding their crimes behind the facade of an ordinary life, few have been adept at amassing wealth. Granted, film and television often feature characters living in digs far more costly than they would seem to be able to afford, but this movie takes it a bit too far.Finally, there is the question of what the movie wants to be. It has some moderately graphic scenes and nudity, but it is about as erotic as laundry. Those graphic scenes culminate in murder, and the scenes in the chat rooms are not nearly as engrossing for the film viewer as they are for the characters. If ""Net Games"" seeks to be a mystery, it fails there, too. In the first 20 or 30 minutes of the film, we know that Angel is blond, lithe, and libidinous. Throughout the film, there are a few blond characters. The detective investigating the case is a blonde, for instance. One of Jennifer's friends is, too. Could either of these women be the mysterious Angel? The film seems equivocal on one of these questions, and ultimately, the connection between Angel and Adam is not sufficiently explained, at least not for me after my one and only viewing.",2,Silly,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,3371,"['Adam', 'Vance', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'problem', 'wife', 'Monique', 'Demers', 'whom', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'in-flight', 'United', 'Airlines', 'travel', 'shows', 'recovering', 'rape', 'not', 'as', 'amorous', 'Adam', 'would', 'like', 'Adam', 'friend', 'online', 'site', 'notable', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'rooms', 'Thus', 'Adam', 'descent', 'aFatal', 'Attractionfor', 'Internet', 'age', 'plot', 'as', 'simple', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'sadly', 'complexities', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense.Angel', 'Lara', 'Sloatman', 'Amityville', 'New', 'Generation', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'Is', 'Dead', 'woman', 'whom', 'Adam', 'meets', 'chat', 'room', 'are', 'soon', 'engaging', 'ahem', 'candid', 'chats', 'chats', 'are', 'more', 'amusing', 'bawdy', 'characters', 'speak', 'lines', 'hit', 'few', 'keys', 'then', 'speak', 'next', 'line', 'understand', 'presumed', 'need', 'characters', 'talk', 'still', 'am', 'not', 'speaking', 'type', 'Perhapsspeech', 'recognition', 'softwarewould', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'idea', 'film', 'When', 'Angel', 'too', 'aggressive', 'Adam', 'call', 'off', 'fiber-optic', 'relationship', 'Too', 'late', 'though.The', 'primary', 'problem', 'movie', 'number', 'implausibilities', 'viewer', 'must', 'accept', 'instance', 'night', 'was', 'be', 'Adam', 'Angel', 'first', 'telephone', 'date', 'go', 'out', 'employers', 'celebrate', 'big', 'contract', 'problem', 'there', 'Angel', 'repeatedly', 'apparently', '24', 'times', 'see', 'rather', 'upset', 'home', 'Later', 'though', 'learn', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'same', 'time', 'point', 'Adam', 'best', 'friend', 'do', 'something', 'very', 'stupid', 'when', 'find', 'body', 'decide', 'bury', 'Later', 'however', 'out', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'followed', 'remote', 'location', 'even', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'ever', 'burying', 'body', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'make', 'absolutely', 'sure', 'drove', 'burial', 'site', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'followed.There', 'also', 'issue', 'Adam', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Remember', 'inability', 'be', 'romantic', 'premise', 'Adam', 'scurrying', 'depths', 'cyberspace', 'Later', 'however', 'personality', 'change', 'so', 'dramatic', 'laughable', 'Angel', 'part', 'clearly', 'unbalanced', 'yet', 'house', 'almost', 'palatial', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'suppose', 'good', 'hiding', 'crimes', 'facade', 'ordinary', 'life', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'adept', 'amassing', 'wealth', 'Granted', 'film', 'television', 'often', 'feature', 'characters', 'living', 'digs', 'far', 'more', 'costly', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'movie', 'bit', 'too', 'far.Finally', 'question', 'what', 'movie', 'be', 'moderately', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'as', 'erotic', 'laundry', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'culminate', 'murder', 'scenes', 'chat', 'rooms', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'engrossing', 'film', 'viewer', 'are', 'characters', 'Net', 'Games', 'be', 'mystery', 'there', 'too', 'first', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'know', 'Angel', 'blond', 'lithe', 'libidinous', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'blond', 'characters', 'detective', 'investigating', 'case', 'blonde', 'instance', 'One', 'Jennifer', 'friends', 'too', 'Could', 'either', 'women', 'be', 'mysterious', 'Angel', 'film', 'equivocal', 'one', 'questions', 'ultimately', 'connection', 'Angel', 'Adam', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'explained', 'least', 'not', 'one', 'only', 'viewing']",N/A
