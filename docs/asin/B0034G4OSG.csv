Don't get me wrong there are some well constructed subplots and if you are really into cop movies this might be right up your alley but to me it was pretty run of the mill. I didn't get that WOW factor from any of the plot twist or plot lines.  Its a good rainy day rental in my opinion.  The one shining star in this film is Don Cheadle -he really makes this movie and without his performance it would be more like a 2 star movie.,3,Average Action Film,1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,513,"['film', 'definitely', 'three-star', 'film', 'typical', 'undercover', 'cop', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'well', 'constructed', 'subplots', 'are', 'really', 'cop', 'movies', 'might', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'was', 'pretty', 'run', 'mill', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'WOW', 'factor', 'plot', 'twist', 'plot', 'lines', 'good', 'rainy', 'day', 'rental', 'opinion', 'one', 'shining', 'star', 'film', 'Don', 'Cheadle', '-he', 'really', 'movie', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'more', '2', 'star', 'movie']",N/A
1321600,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B0034G4OSG,Amit Talpade,"[2, 3]","Training days Antoine Fuqua returns with a cop story (actually three) but this time on the East coast. The title is a misnomer because the cops are anything but the finest. Ethan Hawke is the first cop who is corrupt and wants enough money for the down payment for a new house. Richard Gere is a cynical veteran who is hated by his colleagues and has seven days left until his retirement after 22 years on the job. Don Cheadle the third cop wants to be away from the action and is looking for a desk job in the department. The movie follows their lives and incidents until the climax where they all meet. I thought the writing for the most part was very weak. Richard Gere was IMHO completely miscast and Don Cheadle looked indifferent. Ethan Hawke acted and looked the part of a desperate cop without reason well. The movie is about Brooklyn and so the locations are new and different, not the same old ones from Manhattan. I thought I would get some new Brooklyn sights but the director could not entirely resist shooting the Manhattan skyline. The movie was bearable for at least one viewing.

The score is GREAT and the cinematography all combined paints a verydisturbing movie about three police detectives each with seperate struggles and lives, whose destinies converge over one case that changes everything for all of them. If you enjoy a gripping drama that pulls you in from the beginning....this is for you. Everything about this movie is WELL DONE. I did not give it five stars, because you have to pay attention early or it becomes a bit confusing. The musicscore is very good, in part because unlike so many movies today, you don't have to listen to pop or rock. Its primarily mood and instrumental music that actually helpsbuild the suspense and set the tone of the film. The CAST is first RATE....Wesley Snipes, Don Cheadle give very compelling performances. Ethan Hawke is also EXCELLENTas is my personal favorite actor in the film, Richard Gere. His character while not likeable early, is very believable, The mark for me of great acting, is when the actor can make you forget who ""they"" are. Gere becomes his character. Its greatwork!The movie is so interesting, that I found myself being facinated withthe mechanics of the film. Its very GOOD filmmaking, a work of art. I don't say thatabout a lot of films, but a director's cut of this film would even be a better buy then the original release and well worth it.

After that scene, it didn't take long for me to soon get wrapped up in each of the three New York police officers' (Cheadle, Hawke, Gere) lives. I was actually surprised it wasn't until the end that they came together at the same location, each of them with different motives for being there. Brooklyn's Finest is somewhat like three movies in one, flipping back and forth between characters' story lines.Gere's character probably could have been removed without the movie skipping a beat, but I found myself rooting for him. He just wanted to retire and get through his last week on the job, yet stuff kept falling into his lap. Wesley Snipes stole it for me despite his small role, though. I would have liked to have seen more of him. Cheadle and Snipes as notorious figures in the drug business is a great pair.

1321607,A2X17SA4E8V3PU,B0034G4OSG,Bstrassell0001,"[0, 0]","A large war is being fought in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, a borough much smaller than the war being fought in it.Does it sound too good to be true? It is both good and true, believe it or not! Brooklyn's Finest is a ""love it or hate it film."" Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) claims in his commentary that he looked to the opera as his guiding force for his job as the film's director. This is the cause of the opposition that Brooklyn's Finest has gotten, but if you can observe the suspense, the characters, and the performances aside from Fuqua's ""opera"" method......they ALL override it, at least in my opinion....Below, I give you as much proof as I can, supporting my own opinion with the psychology of Brooklyn's Finest, psychology executed brilliantly not only by Fuqua, but also by the actors working under him (most notably the picture's three stars: Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle, and Richard Gere).Hawke, in a role that mirrors his first role under Fuqua (Training Day) *****only***** in the fact that both pictures find him as a family man, is a good cop turned bad. His character, Salvatore ""Sal"" Procida, has a good intention in going bad: he wants to earn money that he needs for his whole family to remain in the same house with him. Fuqua and screenwriter Michael C. Martin give Sal the benefit of the doubt in the fact that, if Sal does not get the money he needs, he will have to tell one of his children that they have to move out of their house with Sal, their mother Anjie (Lili Taylor), and their fellow siblings. You feel for Sal, of course, but you know that you can't support him when it comes to the way that he breaks not only the rules of his job, but also the law to get the money that he needs. Fuqua and Martin ask us; what is the line between right and wrong, morally right and unrealistically restrictive? The internal conflicts surrounding this question are brought to life impeccably by Hawke in his performance as Sal. The reason why Fuqua cast Hawke in Training Day (Hawke being a husband and father who could understand his character of Jake Hoyt's struggles in keeping his fictional family in Training Day safe) shines again beautifully here. As Hawke becomes his character, Fuqua throws at him one challenge after another, and Hawke always lives up to the challenge (as an actor) as his character continues to fall farther and farther behind...With Cheadle, his performance is the most simple, but his challenges are by far the most complex. His character, Clarence ""Tango"" Butler, struggles not only with his job itself, but also with many internal conflicts surrounding the job. These conflicts surround his relationship with Cassanova ""Caz"" Phillips (Wesley Snipes), a drug dealer he agreed to infiltrate many years ago. Tango has not only gotten in too deep with Caz...he has also had his life saved by Caz! And, meanwhile, he knows that Caz is about to reform him himself (this may be hard to see, but Fuqua confirms it in his commentary). Now, it is up to Tango to choose between mercy without justice or justice to a man about to become innocent. It doesn't help that his lieutenant (Will Patton) is working with a special agent (Ellen Barkin) who knows how to send him to Hell if he does not complete the job he first signed onto...Last, but not least, you have Richard Gere's character of Edward ""Eddie"" Dugan. A police officer only seven days away from retirement, Eddie is about to meet his worst days on the job....his last days. As Eddie finds himself up against young, new, and ""difficult"" partners, his morality is challenged, and will either bring him about as 1) a disgrace, 2) a hero, or 3) a disgraced hero. In his performance as Eddie, Gere teams up with Fuqua as both put Eddie in continuous physical and emotional danger. As both put Eddie in danger from one moment to the next, Gere turns his character's internal conflicts into his own and masterfully pours drama into suspense, and suspense into drama (just watch his character's situations and you'll know exactly what I mean...)Together, Gere, Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle (alone and in the very rare onscreen moments that the three actors share with each other; Gere alone with Hawke in one scene and alone with Cheadle in another; Hawke and Cheadle coming face to face themselves without Gere), and Antoine Fuqua (next to the powerful ensemble cast surrounding them, including Vincent D'Onofrio in a cameo appearance with Hawke) bring the hostile and vulnerable streets of Brooklyn to life.  How they did so is revealed in Fuqua's commentary for the film, next to the DVD's five featurettes (one about the life of ***any*** New York cop, one about the real BK housing projects in Brooklyn, separate writer and director featurettes, and deleted scenes).Highly recommended!",5,Psychologically and physically powerful,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,4800,"['large', 'war', 'being', 'fought', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'borough', 'Brooklyn', 'borough', 'much', 'smaller', 'war', 'being', 'fought', 'it.Does', 'sound', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'good', 'true', 'believe', 'not', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'Director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'Training', 'Day', 'claims', 'commentary', 'looked', 'opera', 'guiding', 'force', 'job', 'film', 'director', 'cause', 'opposition', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'gotten', 'can', 'observe', 'suspense', 'characters', 'performances', 'aside', 'Fuqua', 'opera', 'method', 'override', 'least', 'opinion', '.Below', 'give', 'much', 'proof', 'can', 'supporting', 'own', 'opinion', 'psychology', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'psychology', 'executed', 'brilliantly', 'not', 'only', 'Fuqua', 'also', 'actors', 'working', 'most', 'notably', 'picture', 'three', 'stars', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Richard', 'Gere', '.Hawke', 'role', 'first', 'role', 'Fuqua', 'Training', 'Day', '*****only*****', 'fact', 'pictures', 'find', 'family', 'man', 'good', 'cop', 'turned', 'bad', 'character', 'Salvatore', 'Sal', 'Procida', 'good', 'intention', 'going', 'bad', 'earn', 'money', 'whole', 'family', 'remain', 'same', 'house', 'Fuqua', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Martin', 'give', 'Sal', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'fact', 'Sal', 'not', 'get', 'money', 'will', 'have', 'tell', 'one', 'children', 'have', 'move', 'house', 'Sal', 'mother', 'Anjie', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'fellow', 'siblings', 'feel', 'Sal', 'course', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'support', 'when', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'rules', 'job', 'also', 'law', 'get', 'money', 'Fuqua', 'Martin', 'ask', 'what', 'line', 'right', 'wrong', 'morally', 'right', 'unrealistically', 'restrictive', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'surrounding', 'question', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'impeccably', 'Hawke', 'performance', 'Sal', 'reason', 'why', 'Fuqua', 'cast', 'Hawke', 'Training', 'Day', 'Hawke', 'being', 'husband', 'father', 'who', 'could', 'understand', 'character', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'struggles', 'keeping', 'fictional', 'family', 'Training', 'Day', 'safe', 'shines', 'again', 'beautifully', 'here', 'Hawke', 'character', 'Fuqua', 'one', 'challenge', 'Hawke', 'always', 'up', 'challenge', 'actor', 'character', 'fall', 'farther', 'farther', 'Cheadle', 'performance', 'most', 'simple', 'challenges', 'are', 'far', 'most', 'complex', 'character', 'Clarence', 'Tango', 'Butler', 'not', 'only', 'job', 'also', 'many', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'surrounding', 'job', 'conflicts', 'surround', 'relationship', 'Cassanova', 'Caz', 'Phillips', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'drug', 'dealer', 'agreed', 'infiltrate', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Tango', 'not', 'only', 'gotten', 'too', 'deep', 'Caz', 'also', 'had', 'life', 'saved', 'Caz', 'meanwhile', 'Caz', 'reform', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'see', 'Fuqua', 'commentary', 'Now', 'Tango', 'choose', 'mercy', 'justice', 'justice', 'man', 'become', 'innocent', ""n't"", 'help', 'lieutenant', 'Will', 'Patton', 'working', 'special', 'agent', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'who', 'how', 'send', 'Hell', 'not', 'complete', 'job', 'first', 'signed', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'have', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'character', 'Edward', 'Eddie', 'Dugan', 'A', 'police', 'officer', 'only', 'seven', 'days', 'away', 'retirement', 'Eddie', 'meet', 'worst', 'days', 'job', 'last', 'days', 'Eddie', 'up', 'young', 'new', 'difficult', 'partners', 'morality', 'challenged', 'will', 'either', 'bring', 'about', '1', 'disgrace', '2', 'hero', '3', 'disgraced', 'hero', 'performance', 'Eddie', 'Gere', 'up', 'Fuqua', 'put', 'Eddie', 'continuous', 'physical', 'emotional', 'danger', 'put', 'Eddie', 'danger', 'one', 'moment', 'next', 'Gere', 'character', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'own', 'masterfully', 'pours', 'drama', 'suspense', 'suspense', 'drama', 'just', 'watch', 'character', 'situations', ""'ll"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'mean', 'Together', 'Gere', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'alone', 'very', 'rare', 'onscreen', 'moments', 'three', 'actors', 'share', 'other', 'Gere', 'alone', 'Hawke', 'one', 'scene', 'alone', 'Cheadle', 'Hawke', 'Cheadle', 'coming', 'face', 'face', 'Gere', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'next', 'powerful', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'surrounding', 'including', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Hawke', 'bring', 'hostile', 'vulnerable', 'streets', 'Brooklyn', 'life', 'How', 'did', 'so', 'revealed', 'Fuqua', 'commentary', 'film', 'next', 'DVD', 'five', 'featurettes', 'one', 'life', '***any***', 'New', 'York', 'cop', 'one', 'real', 'BK', 'housing', 'projects', 'Brooklyn', 'separate', 'writer', 'director', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes', '.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1321608,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B0034G4OSG,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[1, 2]","You would think that director Antoine Fuqua has a problem with cops. At least, that is the impression that you get when you watch his films about police matters. He was responsible for ""Training Day"" (2001), which won Denzel Washington a well-deserved Academy Award for his portrayal of a corrupt cop. Now, Fuqua returns with ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" another penetrating and unforgettable look at what goes on behind doors at police precincts.If ""Training Day"" examined the behavior of a truly bad cop, ""Brooklyn Finest"" does the same with three policemen that are honest, but with flaws. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a 22-year veteran patrolman in the police force, who has just seven days left before retirement. Unfortunately and unexpectedly, and against his will, he is assigned to train rookies in some of the city's worst neighborhoods. As expected, those seven days will not go smoothly. On the other hand, Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover cop that is desperately trying to move away from this assignment, which is stressing him out. The only way out, as ordered by his superiors, is for him to deliver Caz (Wesley Snipes), a drug lord, to justice. Caz happens to be a Tango's good friend from the old days. And then there is Sal (Ethan Hawke), a vice cop with too many kids and two more on the way, and who is suffocated by debt. Out of desperation, it seems that his only way out is through some questionable acts. The movie slowly takes us to a dramatic end, in which the future of these men will be defined.""Brooklyn Finest"" is dark, dramatic and sad, and it hits you hard. It is real life stuff - as it should be --, and makes you take a closer look at how stressful a cop's life can be.

Ethan Hawke plays Sal, a devoted Catholic father and husband who is struggling to make ends meet and feels like a failure as a provider. Don Cheadle plays Tango, an undercover cop, and it's hard to tell which is more real for him: his life with his drug-dealing 'buddies' or his career as a cop.They are all tormented: Eddie is unhappy, bitter and suicidal; Sal is pushing the lines between right and wrong to try to provide for his family; and Tango is caught between his desire to make detective and loyalty to those close to him. Wesley Snipes plays Tango's drug dealer friend, Caz, and Ellen Barkin plays the boss who convinces Tango to turn Caz in, but both don't have major roles and I didn't even realize they were in the movie until I saw their names in the credits.The acting is superb, the story is good, the movie is fast-paced and gripping and hooks you.",4,Started off not liking it but was hooked 15 min in,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,1364,"['had', 'movie', 'awhile', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'watching', 'Tonight', 'finally', 'did', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'superb', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'tense', 'gritty', 'police', 'dramas', 'one', 'hooked', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'play', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'Brooklyn', 'cops', 'thought', 'especially', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'were', 'fantastic.Gere', 'looove', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Eddie', '7', 'days', 'away', 'retirement', 'non-outstanding', 'career', 'force', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Sal', 'devoted', 'Catholic', 'father', 'husband', 'who', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'feels', 'failure', 'provider', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Tango', 'undercover', 'cop', 'hard', 'tell', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'drug-dealing', ""'buddies"", 'career', 'cop.They', 'are', 'tormented', 'Eddie', 'unhappy', 'bitter', 'suicidal', 'Sal', 'pushing', 'lines', 'right', 'wrong', 'try', 'provide', 'family', 'Tango', 'caught', 'desire', 'make', 'detective', 'loyalty', 'close', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Tango', 'drug', 'dealer', 'friend', 'Caz', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'boss', 'who', 'Tango', 'turn', 'Caz', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'major', 'roles', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'were', 'movie', 'saw', 'names', 'credits.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'story', 'good', 'movie', 'fast-paced', 'gripping']",N/A

While not destined to become the fan classic that Denzel helped deliver, Brooklyn's Finest offers up an excellent cast and an explosive ending.Don Cheadle, as an undercover cop, gives a terrific performance while continuing to prove himself as one of Hollywood's most underrated actors.  It was also amazing to watch Ethan Hawke as a corrupt officer, but unlike Training Day's Alonzo, you really feel his vulnerability.  He's thrown into a pressure cooker early into the film, with tension so real that you can almost touch it.  If you're a diehard fan of HBO's The Wire like myself, you're going to love the casting of Michael K. Williams (Omar Little) and Hassan Johnson (Wee-Bey) as Brooklyn dealers, and Isiah Whitlock Jr (Senator Clay ""Sheeee*t"" Davis) as a city investigator.  Wesley Snipes gives a great New Jack City throwback performance as drug kingpin Caz.  Richard Gere plays the role of a weathered cop to perfection, despite being handed a script filled with one too many police flick cliches.Brooklyn's Finest starts especially slow, but really picks up steam past the film's halfway mark.  The cinematography and directing are both on point, and Fuqua's use of lighting is excellent.  Brazilian composer Marcelo Zarvos (Sin Nombre) did a great job with the score, and the rest of the soundtrack fits perfectly (particularly the Busta Rhymes track during a stash house raid).  And like The Wire, police bureaucracy is exposed, corruption is revealed, and the streets take no prisoners.The film gets four stars instead of five, simply because there are one too many cliches, and the ""Crash"" concept isn't anything new.  But while the plot is at times implausible and not terribly exciting, the intertwining of characters leading up to the film's conclusion is grim and powerful.  Not the best film of 2010, but don't miss this one if you enjoy The Wire.",4,"Fans of ""The Wire"" Will Enjoy Brooklyn's Finest",1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,2009,"['been', 'almost', 'decade', 'Director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'treated', 'Training', 'Day', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'still', 'goods', 'not', 'destined', 'become', 'fan', 'classic', 'Denzel', 'helped', 'deliver', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'up', 'excellent', 'cast', 'explosive', 'ending.Don', 'Cheadle', 'undercover', 'cop', 'terrific', 'performance', 'continuing', 'prove', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'was', 'also', 'amazing', 'watch', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'corrupt', 'officer', 'Training', 'Day', 'Alonzo', 'really', 'feel', 'vulnerability', 'thrown', 'pressure', 'cooker', 'early', 'film', 'tension', 'so', 'real', 'can', 'almost', 'touch', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'fan', 'HBO', 'Wire', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'casting', 'Michael', 'K.', 'Williams', 'Omar', 'Little', 'Hassan', 'Johnson', 'Wee-Bey', 'Brooklyn', 'dealers', 'Isiah', 'Whitlock', 'Jr', 'Senator', 'Clay', 'Sheeee*t', 'Davis', 'city', 'investigator', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'great', 'New', 'Jack', 'City', 'throwback', 'performance', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Caz', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'role', 'weathered', 'cop', 'perfection', 'being', 'handed', 'script', 'filled', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'police', 'flick', 'cliches.Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'especially', 'slow', 'really', 'up', 'steam', 'film', 'halfway', 'mark', 'cinematography', 'directing', 'are', 'point', 'Fuqua', 'use', 'lighting', 'excellent', 'Brazilian', 'composer', 'Marcelo', 'Zarvos', 'Sin', 'Nombre', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'score', 'rest', 'soundtrack', 'perfectly', 'particularly', 'Busta', 'Rhymes', 'track', 'stash', 'house', 'raid', 'Wire', 'police', 'bureaucracy', 'exposed', 'corruption', 'revealed', 'streets', 'take', 'prisoners.The', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'simply', 'are', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'cliches', 'Crash', 'concept', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'plot', 'times', 'implausible', 'not', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'intertwining', 'characters', 'leading', 'up', 'film', 'conclusion', 'grim', 'powerful', 'Not', 'best', 'film', '2010', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'enjoy', 'Wire']",N/A

After hearing that Antoine Fuqua was making another thought provoking crime drama, I couldn't wait to watch this movie.  I assumed he was going to apply the same gritty ultra-realism that he did in Training Day, and he did.  The only thing, I didn't see Brooklyn's Finest as quite as a compelling story as Training Day.  So, I guess I had my sights set too high for this one.  As good as it was, I didn't seem to appreciate it much on the first viewing.  Upon a second viewing though, the movie began to grow on me.Snipes, Gere, Cheadle, Hawk - they all give first rate performances.  Scenery and story play well to the performances given.  I think this movie will never reach the status of a Training Day caliber movie, but if you liked that movie - then you will want to watch Brooklyn's Finest also.  To be fair, Brooklyn's Finest should stand on its own without comparison to be appreciated.  Fuqua's style as a director is so natural and realistic and with this genre, it pays off.

The latter two characters are fairly well drawn but Gere's character as written is un-developed to the point that we're left asking why is he in the first scene, ready to shoot himself.  We know he's in a dismal state of mind but the writer who's a first timer doesn't fill in the blanks as to why he's so suicidal. For instance is it guilt over a partner's death, the loss of his kids over a bitter divorce or the disappointment that he didn't make detective?  All these could've been a reason for his anguish if the writer wrote them in the script.  Gere has proved himself to be an excellent actor if the script is well developed as he showed us in ""Internal Affairs"" where he played a corrupt cop but here the writer and director have left him stranded.  Anyway the acting of the whole cast which includes Ellen Barkin as power-hungry D.A. is without reproach so on that basis I would give this a 3.5 or 4 but one wishes it could've risen to the level of Fuqua's ""Training Day"".

His goal (aside from enjoying the services of a certain ""professional"" whom he likes more than he should) is to maintain his sanity, keep his nose clean and keep his rookie cop partner under control for just a few more days so that he can cash in on his pension with a little pride. But as it turns out, his last week on the job is probably the worst of his entire career.Wesley Snipes returns to the big screen as the smart, ruthless drug lord ""Caz"" running the streets of Brooklyn. He's been in the game for too long as well and appears to be losing his ""street cred"", as he doesn't know who to trust anymore.  His most trusted partner however, happens to be Tango who, unbeknownst to Caz, is working undercover to bust his operation.Brooklyn's Finest tells a graphic story about each of these characters and the double lives and personal struggles that each one has to deal with on a daily basis. All three are ""fine"" cops in their own way, but the demands of their dangerous jobs, in a corrupt world, gets the best of them. Neither cop knows the other one, but their fate is ultimately intertwined.This movie starts out quite slow but it eventually progresses into a very good film. This is a serious cop drama that is very raw in its portrayal of crime and corruption on the mean urban streets. It contains certain elements of other movies, such as ""Training Day"", ""New Jack City"", ""American Gangster"" and ""Crash"" all meshed together into one powerful movie.The casting and acting are superb, but the story leaves nothing to the imagination and exploits stereotypes to the max. Highly recommended, nonetheless.WARNINIG: Contains graphic sexual content, extreme violence and profanity.

1321623,A150HXN1PBL3C9,B0034G4OSG,"Edward S. Brown ""Charisma Expert""","[3, 5]","""Brooklyn's Finest"" is one of those films where the trailer is better than the movie.  How can a movie with an all-star cast (Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke and Wesley Snipes) fail?  There is a business theory that suggests that if something worked in the past; it will work in the future with a little tweaking.  Not always true!  ""Brooklyn's Finest"" attempts to fuse the conceptual plots of ""Fort Apache: The Bronx"" and ""Crash"" into one seamless masterpiece.  What invariably happens is a convoluted montage of the two movies poorly conceived.Although, Antoine Fuqua of ""Training Day"" fame directed ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" I was interested in discovering the screenwriter?  Upon further investigation, I discovered the screenwriter was Michael C. Martin, who revealed on an online blog that this was his first feature film.  Everything made sense!  You can have an all-star cast with a world class director, but if the writing is poorly written and developed, nothing can save the movie.  Martin could have been influenced by ""Fort Apache: The Bronx"" and ""Crash,"" but to blatantly rip off the concepts and under-develop the characters is a travesty.  It demonstrates a lack of thought into developing the high concept as well as ""lazy Intellectualism.""This was an excellent opportunity to go into the inner sanctum of law enforcement and the underworld in ways that had not been done before.  With the cast and director set, the movie could have been a true blockbuster.  Instead it hopes to be a ""sleeper hit"" by going straight to DVD.I recommend renting this movie from a ""Red Box"" kiosk to compare it to other crime dramas.

1321630,ATJE929ETFFNH,B0034G4OSG,"Fred ""Fred""","[0, 1]","The spirit of Antoine Fuqua's Training Day is applied liberally to Brooklyn's Finest but doesn't bring with it the same grittiness that won him acclaim on the former movie. Don't get me wrong, Brooklyn's Finest is not a bad movie; it's got legs enough for a popcorn evening at home and a decent enough story, but I think its weakness lies in the multiple protagonist story lines combined with traces of well-worn movie tropes and archetypes.Don Cheadle's undercover cop is just like all the others who have graced that well-traveled path over the long years, with a twist alas telegraphed within the first hour. Richard Gere's plodding, disillusioned old-timer short-timer seems to want either of two things: leave the Force and spend the rest of his life fishing or finishing himself off Mel Gibson in the first Lethal Weapon style. I can understand the need, after 22 long years, of retiring to fish, but not enough--at least from the storyline itself--why he wants to off himself. In the end, he re-enacts the climax of Taxi Driver to little effect.Ethan Hawke plays a somewhat pathetic Catholic cop with the attendant number of condom-less inspired children with two more (twins) on the way. As in Training Day, Hawke has a controlling and vexing dilemma: in Brooklyn's Finest, he desperately needs to move out of his terrible moldy house because he's run of out kid-room and also because the house is affecting his pregnant wife's health, but he doesn't have the money for a down payment on a lavish-sounding dream house. On the other hand, he's a struggling Catholic with the requisite Catholic sin-guilt trying to do good going hand in hand with his need to be a good cop. What is he to do? Well, let's just say he takes the tragic way out.As an aside, I don't know, but if I were him, I'd stop having as many kids as to cause that much financial pain. That or move somewhere that isn't exactly a DREAM, but that would have the space for his brood. There are good deals to be had especially in this economy. Not only this, but his cop pal actually points out a perfectly reasonable solution to his problem, but the script had him on a set of tracks going nowhere.Wesley Snipes' character has just gotten out of prison--something I think Mr. Snipes in real life would like to have had behind him instead of ahead--but mostly plays the pallid and rather unbelievable raison d'etre for Cheadle. Entirely forgettable.So there you have all these intertwined stories that diffuses the punch. Training Day was memorable because the story centered on a strong character and HIS story. Here Fuqua attempts an ensemble cast story and ends up watering it all down so that I didn't really get the full measure of any one. To his credit, the pitfall of losing the plot didn't happen here--everyone's story does get told in full, but you couldn't care less by the end.Three stars out of five.",3,Predictability And Probability,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2885,"['spirit', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'Training', 'Day', 'applied', 'liberally', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', ""n't"", 'bring', 'same', 'grittiness', 'won', 'acclaim', 'former', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'got', 'legs', 'enough', 'popcorn', 'evening', 'home', 'decent', 'enough', 'story', 'think', 'weakness', 'multiple', 'protagonist', 'story', 'lines', 'combined', 'traces', 'well-worn', 'movie', 'tropes', 'archetypes.Don', 'Cheadle', 'undercover', 'cop', 'just', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'graced', 'well-traveled', 'path', 'long', 'years', 'twist', 'alas', 'telegraphed', 'first', 'hour', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'plodding', 'disillusioned', 'old-timer', 'short-timer', 'want', 'two', 'things', 'leave', 'Force', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'fishing', 'finishing', 'off', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'first', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'style', 'can', 'understand', 'need', '22', 'long', 'years', 'retiring', 'fish', 'not', 'enough', 'least', 'storyline', 'why', 'off', 'end', 'climax', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'little', 'effect.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'somewhat', 'pathetic', 'Catholic', 'cop', 'attendant', 'number', 'condom-less', 'inspired', 'children', 'two', 'more', 'twins', 'way', 'Training', 'Day', 'Hawke', 'controlling', 'vexing', 'dilemma', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'desperately', 'move', 'terrible', 'moldy', 'house', 'run', 'kid-room', 'also', 'house', 'affecting', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'health', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'down', 'payment', 'lavish-sounding', 'dream', 'house', 'other', 'hand', 'struggling', 'Catholic', 'requisite', 'Catholic', 'sin-guilt', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'going', 'hand', 'hand', 'need', 'be', 'good', 'cop', 'What', 'do', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'tragic', 'way', 'aside', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', ""'d"", 'stop', 'having', 'many', 'kids', 'cause', 'much', 'financial', 'pain', 'move', 'somewhere', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'DREAM', 'would', 'have', 'space', 'brood', 'are', 'good', 'deals', 'be', 'had', 'especially', 'economy', 'Not', 'only', 'cop', 'pal', 'actually', 'out', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'solution', 'problem', 'script', 'had', 'set', 'tracks', 'going', 'nowhere.Wesley', 'Snipes', 'character', 'just', 'gotten', 'out', 'prison', 'something', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Snipes', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'had', 'instead', 'ahead', 'mostly', 'pallid', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'Cheadle', 'Entirely', 'forgettable.So', 'there', 'have', 'intertwined', 'stories', 'punch', 'Training', 'Day', 'was', 'memorable', 'story', 'centered', 'strong', 'character', 'HIS', 'story', 'Here', 'Fuqua', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'story', 'up', 'watering', 'down', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'full', 'measure', 'one', 'credit', 'pitfall', 'losing', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'everyone', 'story', 'get', 'told', 'full', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'end.Three', 'stars', 'five']",N/A

Well, here's a movie for you. Do you like your gore to be so realistic that when a bullet strikes a body, you can not only see the blood gush out, you can hear it? I'm not kidding.

He's a totally burned out street cop who only has one week to go before retirement after 20 years and he's not exactly looking to get involved in anything. He's associated with the 65th Precinct, the worst precinct in a notorious part of badly decaying Brooklyn. Hoods and drug dealers are everywhere and the police have undercover cops who are among them. Well, this is about the worst collection of cops I've ever witnessed and everyone follows his own rules. Cops are openly stealing money and dope and murder hoods who are into the same thing. Everyone is suspicious of everyone else. It's an open brawl between the good guys and the bad guys and, except for the uniforms, it would be hard to tell the difference between the two.It's an interesting story and is well done. You might expect to end up depressed and wonder where our nation is headed. Well, some people enjoy  this entirely negative view of the world. If you're not one of them, don't say you weren't warned.

1321632,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0034G4OSG,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","BROOKLYN'S FINEST as written  by Michael C. Martin and directed by Antoine Fuqua ('Training Day', 'Shooter') provides an intense study of the live of three Brooklyn policemen and details how they are all on the brink of being burned out by the grisly requirements of their work in one of the most crime infested areas in the country.  Richard Gere is Eddie, a veteran cop with seven days to go before retirement who is assigned to a couple of Rookies to be a role model: Eddie's only moments of tranquility come from alcohol and from steady encounters with hooker Chantel (Shannon Kane in one of the film's finest roles).  Don Cheadle is Tango, an undercover narcotics division cop assigned to a sting operation driven by the only female detective Ellen Barkin that involves a old friend Caz (Wesley Snipes): Tango is consumed by conflict and is mentally worn thin by his work.  Ethan Hawke is Sal, married to diabetic Angela (Lili Taylor), pregnant with twins: Sal has tried everything (even dirty cop tactics and maneuvers) to get enough cash to move his growing beloved family to a better home.  These three stories weave simultaneously  throughout the film and finally come together in a surprising twist at the end.The film has the look of the subject of the movie: everything is dark, dirty, infested with vermin and all manner of crime, and intertwined with mean streets.  It captures the grit of the story and manages to allow us to understand each of the main characters.  There is a point of contention in the writing: a vast portion of the script is written (and subsequently delivered) in street talk so foul that it becomes annoying. Most of the dialogue within the gang scenes is not understandable: turn on the subtitles and the mystery of what is being said is not clarified at all.  This may make the film more realistic but it hides the simple ability to communicate verbally in the slang of the streets.

No real love or family life.Gere plays his role with both tenderness and sadness...By this time, he is such a skilled veteran actor thathe can bring so many emotional nuances to a rolesimultaneously with seemingly effortless flair.He really captures the emptiness/loneliness ofhis character to a tee!Ethan Hawke--Plays the quintessential bad cop who willdo anything, and I mean ANYTHING!!--to bring in extra moneyso he can give his family the better things in life thata mere policemen's salary cannot afford in these tougheconomic times.

Cheadle's character chose to join the sideof the law, yet at the same time keeping his nose in the streetsas to gain crediblity among the thugs who have been runningSnipe's criminal operations in his absence.His conflict lies in his betrayal of Snipe's characterwho he obviously has respect and affection for, and hisdedication to his job and duties as a member ofBrooklyn's Finest.

Don Cheadle (solid performance as always) has the best role out the three. He plays an undercover cop who struggles with crossed loyalties. He's excellent at what he does, but he wants out -- and can't.Ethan Hawke is a cop also waist-deep in personal conflict. His wife's pregnant with twins, their house is a health hazard, and he's barely got enough money to make it. Temptation abounds in the drug bust trade, and his soul is up for grabs.Richard Gere (surprisingly good in this role!) is a cop about to retire with barely nothing to show for save for a painfully mediocre career, and he doesn't necessarily see anything wrong with that.We follow these three separate tales for one week until by some stroke of fate, all three are brought together one fateful night.",3,Good (not great) cop drama,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,1120,"['Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'nothing', 'ordinary', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'either', 'who', 'enjoy', 'cop', 'dramas', 'would', 'be', 'up', 'alley', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'genius', 'work.Set', 'present-day', 'Brooklyn', 'follow', 'three', 'separate', 'then', 'later', 'intertwined', 'stories', 'three', 'cops', 'two', 'wit', 'ends', 'one', 'end', 'career', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'solid', 'performance', 'always', 'best', 'role', 'three', 'undercover', 'cop', 'who', 'crossed', 'loyalties', 'excellent', 'what', 'out', ""can't.Ethan"", 'Hawke', 'cop', 'also', 'waist-deep', 'personal', 'conflict', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'twins', 'house', 'health', 'hazard', 'barely', 'got', 'enough', 'money', 'make', 'Temptation', 'drug', 'bust', 'trade', 'soul', 'up', 'grabs.Richard', 'Gere', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'role', 'cop', 'retire', 'barely', 'nothing', 'show', 'save', 'painfully', 'mediocre', 'career', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'that.We', 'follow', 'three', 'separate', 'tales', 'one', 'week', 'stroke', 'fate', 'three', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'one', 'fateful', 'night']",N/A

So even though I am not an action fan, I decided to check it out.  Expecting the standard shoot-`em-up action flick, I was pleasantly surprised to find some unexpected twists and a generous helping of genuine suspense among the usual gun battles and stereotypical violence.Don Cheadle, who has made a great impression on me in the past 15 years or so, plays an undercover detective who, after infiltrating a gang of drug dealers, has been asked by the police brass to help take down an associate (Wesley Snipes) who once saved his life while he was setting up his undercover alias in prison.  Richard Gere is completely convincing as a career officer on the cusp of his retirement and pension, whose greatest achievement appears to be staying alive in one of the worst precincts in Brooklyn, while never firing his gun or distinguishing himself in anything but detached survival.  And Ethan Hawke rounds out the trio of ""good cop/bad cop/indifferent cop"" as a dedicated family man who is not above delving into the sinister side of corruption to try and find a better life for his ailing wife and adoring kids.The plot to Brooklyn's finest was a bit confusing on first view, if only because the juxtaposition of the numerous characters made it difficult to sort out who was who, what was what, and even who was up to what, on the first sit-through.  But repeated viewings of the DVD have served to clarify some of the more confusing moments, and the film holds up well to the scrutiny of multiple screenings.  I have watched the film several times with friends, and all have found it to be very good entertainment.

Excellent plot with some great support and scenery in and around inner city Brooklyn.  Here you have three officers at various stages of their careers with their own personal issues regarding family and life.  Each one is left to sort out his problems in their own way.  And although you sense they want to break rules to get over some very difficult situations, they also have some very positive qualities that only tends to make this is an even more intense story.I am simply amazed at how quickly you come to know each character and what each faces.  Gere plays a beat cop nearing retirement, a bit of a loner and an outcast who has values but seems very lost.  Hawke plays an intense detective who has a family and some loyal friends and who has some major choices to make.  Cheadle plays an under cover officer wanting to become a detective and to get out of the line of fire.  His life is also in turmoil.  But you cannot help but like these three characters for their passion for their lives.  Although grim, life goes on and they keep at it trying with hope beyond hope that something will work out.Cheadle is working on the gang that is lead by Wesley Snipes.  This is a different character for him to play from my limited Snipes perspective.  I have always seen him playing more of a hero type.  When I first saw him in the movie, I thought he was someone else.  Pretty cool.  He has his own intensity and does a great job of acting.There is enough to keep you going in the movie, it is rated R and the rating bar relates the reasons why.  Yet, the plot is overall a plus.One treat is Vincent D'Onofrio appearing in one scene with Eathan Hawke, if you saw the movie Staten Island it is a pretty cool reversal of roles.  D'Onofrio does a good job in his dialog and is just excellent.I think there are some suprises for sure, where it falls a little flat is where you are not surprised at some of the outcome.Still and all, this is a picture worth viewing knowing that there is more of a melancholy mood to it.  Knowing some who are officers and some who have been, for sure, the surreal nature of the movie is an attempt to show the edges of life on the force.

Ulibas ""Captain Couth""","[1, 2]","Brooklyn's Finest is a film directed by Antoine Fuqua and stars Eddie (Richard Gere) as a retiring beat cop,  Sal (Ethan Hawke) a detective and (Clarence) Don Cheadle as an undercover cop.  Eddie is on the final days of his job.  Sal is struggling with his job and family life and Clarence is conflicted in his position as an undercover and the problem of betraying his best friend Caz (Wesley Snipes) who just got out of prison and is looking to reclaim his spot on the streets of Brooklyn.  All three of the characters are suffering from mid-life crises and are seeking a way to make life easier from themselves in their respectful lives.  But the daily grind of work, the decaying environment and the uneasy aura of death hanging around their lives along with personal guilt makes it harder and harder every day.  Can these three survive the mean streets as solid members of being Brooklyn's Finest?A grim and gritty film that has it's fair share of annoying cliches but don't let that deter you from watching this interesting film.

His good friend, played by Wesley Snipes, has just got out of jail and Cheadle has a moral dilemma about setting a trap for him, especially when Ellen Barkin, in an exceptional performance as a hard boiled drug agent, pushes him too hard.  He sprouts a lot of dirty street talk which gave a certain authenticity to the role.  And then there is Ethan Hawkes.  He's a religious Catholic who is overburdened with too many mouths to feed and a pregnant sick wife.  He needs money badly and cash seems to be around when drug busts happen.

1321659,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0034G4OSG,Mark Turner,"[6, 8]","It takes a gifted director to weave together three different stories into one cohesive tale. Director Antoine Fuqua (TRAINING DAY) is just such a director. And this week's release of BROOKLYN'S FINEST proves that.Taking place in the current streets of Brooklyn, the story focuses on three different policemen who work there, each dedicated to their job but also taking divergent paths as a result of the day to day struggles they face.Ethan Hawke plays Sal, a family man who would do anything to protect and take care of his family. Unfortunately this includes stealing money from thieves that he busts or killing bad guys and taking their money. Sal has 4 kids, lives in a house filled with mold, has a wife who is pregnant with twins and ill due to the mold and is looking for a new place. All it takes is money. As a top cop in on numerous drug raids, this puts Sal in a position to take dirty money.Don Cheadle plays Tango, a deep undercover cop who is perhaps the best of the three depicted here. Tango has gone undercover enough that he spent time in prison posing as a street hustler and drug dealer. But life on the inside is ruining his life on the outside. And with each passing day, Tango finds himself drawn deeper into the seedy world he now inhabits, changing his perception of reality from what he knew to what he is experiencing.Lastly we have Richard Gere as Eddie. A street cop who has seen it all, Eddie is one week from retirement. Exposed to the worst that humanity has to offer, Eddie courts thoughts of suicide but carries forward looking forward to his last day. Eddie has tired of fighting the good fight only to see something worse replace it. He has given up hope for humanity. He just wants to move on.As the movie progresses each of these characters never interact, but they do run into one another briefly. Sal is facing the temptations of selling his soul in an attempt to fulfill the family dream of a new house. With only days left till their dream home is gone, he must make that final choice of whether to pass over to the side of semi-villain or not.Tango is trying to finish his turn undercover. Done in an attempt to make gold shield detective, his plans are disrupted when the FBI steps in and tries to force him into one last operation. They need a symbol of the drug kingpin world to go down, replacing the public's current image of the police as thugs after the shooting death of an innocent young man in the projects. And their target is Caz (Wesley Snipes), a man involved in drug transportation but also the man who saved Tango's life in prison. While on opposing sides, Tango still feels a debt towards the man.Eddie is forced to work with the rookies just starting in the precinct. Unwilling to make it a pleasant experience, he still focuses on just making it through the day. Ignoring obvious crimes not taking place in his precinct, leaving a new partner in a touch situation, it is day by day for Eddie. But a moment will change all that as he leaves for a new life.Fuqua does a tremendous job not only of making us care for each of these flawed characters, he moves from one story to the next with ease. Each tale reflects the other, each story focusing on policemen and how the temptations arise, how the stress of the job affects their decisions and how those decisions may not always be the right one.No one is to blame in this world. Each character is driven by forces they have no control over. And each one takes a different path. And it is this tremendous job of storytelling that shows in the work of Fuqua and first time feature writer Michael C. Martin. As viewers, let's hope that both continue to offer films like this.

1321662,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0034G4OSG,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[4, 6]","Brooklyn's Finest is an outstanding, gritty thriller with lots of action, suspense and superlative acting. This is not for the faint of heart with all of its violence; but if you can stand it you will be amazed by this film. While some people have written that the film starts out slow and builds up the pace toward the end, the film grabbed me by the throat from the very word go and it never let go of me until the very final frame. The plot moves along at a very good pace and there's plenty of solid, well done character development. The cinematography and choreography shine all the way through and the script was well written. The casting was well done, too.When the film starts, we soon meet three New York City police officers working in a very high crime section of Brooklyn where there is a public housing project, an incident of a cop killing a kid and drug dealing as well. Eddie has worked for 22 years on the force and he is now only 7 days away from retirement with a pension he has longed for even though by the time we meet him he's a shell of a man with a drinking problem, interpersonal difficulties with his estranged wife and few friends. Indeed, the only person Eddie truly connects with is a hooker named Chantel (played wonderfully by Shannon Kane). In addition, there's Tango (aka Clarence, played by Don Cheadle) who's been working undercover with drug dealers for so long he's having trouble remembering who he really is; Tango is desperate to get off the assignment with its street work and have a desk job as a detective. We also get to know Sal (Ethan Hawke) who is also desperate to get his wife and kids out of their dingy, moldy home into a much better one--so desperate, in fact, that Sal has actually been grabbing some of that drug money for himself, not caring what rules he breaks or who he harms in the process.You may think I've given too much of the plot away but I assure you that I haven't. The only other thing I will tell you is that for quite some while in this film, the three principle characters (Eddie, Tango and Sal) lead separate lives but near the end they all converge with some degree of interaction at the troubled housing project in Brooklyn. The last 25 minutes or so of the film are both powerful and memorable; but there is quite a bit of violence so I wouldn't suggest this for young children.In addition, the DVD comes with some great bonus features including deleted scenes; the theatrical trailer and featurettes including ""Chaos & Conflict: The Life of a New York Cop;"" ""Boyz N the Real Hood;"" ""An Eye for Detail: Director Featurette"" and ""From the MTA to the WGA: Writer Featurette."" Look also for superb performances by Brian F. O'Byrne as Officer Ronny Rosario; Lili Taylor as Sal's wife Angela and Ellen Barkin as Agent Smith.Brooklyn's Finest paints a bleak picture of life both on the New York City police force and in the public housing projects of Brooklyn but a lot of what we see here is tragically all too real. I don't think poilce corruption and severe burnout is wide spread; but these are topics that deserve consideration. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy gritty crime dramas and thrillers with dark themes will want to add this to their collections.",5,a well done film that you won't forget anytime soon,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,3278,"['Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'outstanding', 'gritty', 'thriller', 'lots', 'action', 'suspense', 'superlative', 'acting', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'violence', 'can', 'stand', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'film', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'film', 'out', 'slow', 'up', 'pace', 'end', 'film', 'grabbed', 'throat', 'very', 'word', 'go', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'very', 'final', 'frame', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'plenty', 'solid', 'well', 'done', 'character', 'development', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'shine', 'way', 'script', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'casting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'too.When', 'film', 'soon', 'meet', 'three', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'police', 'officers', 'working', 'very', 'high', 'crime', 'section', 'Brooklyn', 'where', 'public', 'housing', 'project', 'incident', 'cop', 'killing', 'kid', 'drug', 'dealing', 'as', 'well', 'Eddie', 'worked', '22', 'years', 'force', 'now', 'only', '7', 'days', 'away', 'retirement', 'pension', 'longed', 'even', 'time', 'meet', 'shell', 'man', 'drinking', 'problem', 'interpersonal', 'difficulties', 'estranged', 'wife', 'few', 'friends', 'Indeed', 'only', 'person', 'Eddie', 'truly', 'hooker', 'named', 'Chantel', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Shannon', 'Kane', 'addition', 'Tango', 'aka', 'Clarence', 'played', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'undercover', 'drug', 'dealers', 'so', 'long', 'having', 'trouble', 'remembering', 'who', 'really', 'Tango', 'desperate', 'get', 'off', 'assignment', 'street', 'work', 'have', 'desk', 'job', 'detective', 'also', 'get', 'know', 'Sal', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'also', 'desperate', 'get', 'wife', 'kids', 'dingy', 'moldy', 'home', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'so', 'desperate', 'fact', 'Sal', 'actually', 'been', 'grabbing', 'drug', 'money', 'not', 'caring', 'what', 'rules', 'who', 'process.You', 'may', 'think', ""'ve"", 'given', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'away', 'assure', 'have', ""n't"", 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'will', 'tell', 'quite', 'while', 'film', 'three', 'principle', 'characters', 'Eddie', 'Tango', 'Sal', 'lead', 'separate', 'lives', 'end', 'converge', 'degree', 'interaction', 'troubled', 'housing', 'project', 'Brooklyn', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'are', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'quite', 'bit', 'violence', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'young', 'children.In', 'addition', 'DVD', 'great', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'including', 'Chaos', 'Conflict', 'Life', 'New', 'York', 'Cop', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Real', 'Hood', 'Eye', 'Detail', 'Director', 'Featurette', 'MTA', 'WGA', 'Writer', 'Featurette', 'Look', 'also', 'superb', 'performances', 'Brian', 'F.', ""O'Byrne"", 'Officer', 'Ronny', 'Rosario', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Sal', 'wife', 'Angela', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Agent', 'Smith.Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'bleak', 'picture', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'police', 'force', 'public', 'housing', 'projects', 'Brooklyn', 'lot', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'tragically', 'too', 'real', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'poilce', 'corruption', 'severe', 'burnout', 'wide', 'spread', 'are', 'topics', 'deserve', 'consideration', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'gritty', 'crime', 'dramas', 'thrillers', 'dark', 'themes', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'collections']",N/A

Martin, delivers another gritty, violent and riveting cop drama about three officers facing life-defining crises.There is really nothing new in the basic set-up of this picture.  We've all seen these kinds of cops before: the veteran uniformed officer, counting the days until is retirement, the undercover cop and the narcotics officer who has crossed over to ""the dark side"".What makes BROOKLYN'S FINEST interesting is that these three overly familiar ""types,"" who never really interact in the picture except in the most inadvertent manner, are constantly surprising us by their actions.  We do not know how these individual stories will end until the final credits roll.Officer Dugan (Richard Gere), separated from his wife, drinks on the job, visits a prostitute at night and does his best to avoid dealing with the rampant crime around him.  However, once he has actually retired, he puts his life at risk to redeem his career of indifference.Officer Butler (Don Cheadle) has been working undercover to bring down drug gangs (even in prison) so long that he has lost all remnants of his personal life.  His wife has divorced him, and now his superiors want him to set-up former drug kingpin Caz (Wesley Snipes).  Butler must now decide where his true loyalties lie, with the Department or with the man who had saved his life in prison.Officer Procida (Ethan Hawke), on the other hand, is doomed right from the movie's opening scene.  Tragically, with a large loving family, he has more to live for than the other two cops, but there is no hope.  His story has to end badly.  We just don't know how it will happen.Director Fuqua's location filming brings s strong, frightening sense of reality to the proceedings.The actors, particularly Hawke, deliver remarkable, award-worthy performances, and a fine cast of players, including Will Patton, Lili Taylor and Ellen Barkin, supports them.My complaints on this film are minor.  The running time could have been a bit shorter and, like with most movies these days that deal with drug gangs, it's often difficult to understand what these particular characters are saying.

Disillusioned and bitter, Grier doesn't want to do more than he has to. Looking for love in all the wrong places (he is sleeping with a coke using prostitute), he seems like a drunk and lazy cop who really doesn't care about justice or policing anymore until he sees something he just can't let go. When the death of his ex-trainee pushes him to take a stand, we aren't surprised, nor are we encouraged.Cheadle is an ambitious undercover narcotics officer who has sacrificed and lost his wife to the job. Desperately wanting a promotion, Cheadle is willing to do anything including setting up his drug dealing friend (played by Wesley Snipes). As they struggle to maintain status in the drug community, things soon get wildly out of hand and a drug war is underway.Ethan Hawke plays a struggling drug officer who is just trying to make ends meet for his ""ever growing"" family. Hawke, feeling pressure to get a new house (because his wife has asthma and is having pregnancy complications related to mold), plans to do the unthinkable. And no, murdering drug dealers to buy your family a new house isn't a good enough reason to kill even if they aren't any loss to society.As the three officers converge in a semi-spectacular finale, we are not too surprised about their outcomes. Would I recommend this movie? Not really, there was nothing too original or different about the plot, no surprises. In essence, Cheadle, Grier and Hawke have played these characters before (or something close to it) and didn't do anything new with the roles, but what merits the 3 star rating was the fact that there were veteran actors who tried to do a decent job with what they had (a script that lacked luster).

Because of the immense acting talent brought to bear, the one-on-one scenes of pure acting between these talents is pretty phenominal.It falls apart, sort of everywhere else. There's obviously a lot of talent being exerted by director Antoine Fuqua, but you can only put so much lipstick on the pig, and the pig in this case is the movie's script. Scene after scene, this script-by-numbers is a virtual mad lib of cop drama. A call goes out, but these bad-boy cops won't respond because it's ""not my turf""- even though the turf they need to go to is within easy walking distance. Hey look, bad guys- let's pump clip after clip of ammunition into the walls. ""We're not following (regulation) on this (synonym for 'bust') because (criminal involved) (past-tense verbed) my (person the cop once had a relationship with)"".The movie winds up having all the violence, drugs, and sex that Fuqua's previous effort Training Day did, but only about a quarter of the brains. The use of violence and general bad stuff feels needless isntead of gritty. If you were a big fan of Training Day, you might want to check this out to see how director Antoine Fuqua is doing, since it's not a wholly bad affair. If you don't mind tossing your brain out the window in order to enjoy some good one-on-ones between big Hollywood starts, this is also a fairly enjoyable.

The ""finest"" motto is the subject of ridicule, as those poor cops have nothing [fine] going for them on any front.  The Ex-NYC Police Chief Bernard Kerik's imprisonment is an example of the ugliness of working in a bureaucratically corrupt system.  The charisma, ultimate sacrifice in securing, protecting, and helping society to conform to law and order, are rewarded with the ultimate despair of each policeman's family, poor health, contempt to their exceptional commitments by government officials, and suspicion and mistrust of the public.On its faade, the policemen are given figurative lip service and glorified for political gains.  In reality, the policemen are left to the perils of excessive and outmatching fire power of criminals and drug dealers, the shear number of unemployed, uneducated, and troubled citizens, and the endless and complicated social decay.  The profiteers are the career-thirsty state-officials, sitting on their Mahogany, shinning desks, isolated from the reality of urban warfare.Every fine cop portrayed in the movie, and fits perfectly real life scenario, is exposed to the ultimate death, yet compensate hourly and on overtime basis.  Most cops work irregular shifts, smoke, and stressed to the end, could not support their family, and resort to prostitution to fill their missing human needs.  Furthermore, the perfect kids of this great Country of ours, who were raised to glorify the saintship of being on the right-side of the law, such as cops, are faced with the reality of political corruption that serves state officials.On the other side, the movie displays the endless blood battles that claim the lives of many innocent blacks, whose only crime was possessing, dealing, or using drugs.  Not as if the government cares about eradicating drugs from society, since that requires creating economic situation conducive to financial security, but because state officials could play the PR game of staying in office and gaining more power.  Most of the dead and dying, poor blacks, have no access to opportunities or any glimpse of hope that could brighten their future.The movie succeeded in questioning the rationale of trusting the government to solve any social or economic problem without the creative and proactive role of the public in holding its governments accountable in making and enforcing laws that could do good to the people.",5,"Fighting failed government policy with more police, guns, corruption, and endless loss of lives.",1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,2460,"['assume', 'title', 'New', 'York', 'Finest', 'was', 'avoided', 'trademark', 'conflict', 'finest', 'motto', 'subject', 'ridicule', 'poor', 'cops', 'have', 'nothing', '[', 'fine', ']', 'going', 'front', 'Ex-NYC', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Bernard', 'Kerik', 'imprisonment', 'example', 'ugliness', 'working', 'bureaucratically', 'corrupt', 'system', 'charisma', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'securing', 'protecting', 'helping', 'society', 'conform', 'law', 'order', 'are', 'rewarded', 'ultimate', 'despair', 'policeman', 'family', 'poor', 'health', 'contempt', 'exceptional', 'commitments', 'government', 'officials', 'suspicion', 'mistrust', 'public.On', 'faade', 'policemen', 'are', 'given', 'figurative', 'lip', 'service', 'glorified', 'political', 'gains', 'reality', 'policemen', 'are', 'left', 'perils', 'excessive', 'outmatching', 'fire', 'power', 'criminals', 'drug', 'dealers', 'shear', 'number', 'unemployed', 'uneducated', 'troubled', 'citizens', 'endless', 'complicated', 'social', 'decay', 'profiteers', 'are', 'career-thirsty', 'state-officials', 'sitting', 'Mahogany', 'shinning', 'desks', 'isolated', 'reality', 'urban', 'warfare.Every', 'fine', 'cop', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'real', 'life', 'scenario', 'exposed', 'ultimate', 'death', 'yet', 'compensate', 'hourly', 'overtime', 'basis', 'Most', 'cops', 'work', 'irregular', 'shifts', 'smoke', 'stressed', 'end', 'could', 'not', 'support', 'family', 'resort', 'prostitution', 'fill', 'missing', 'human', 'needs', 'Furthermore', 'perfect', 'kids', 'great', 'Country', 'ours', 'who', 'were', 'raised', 'glorify', 'saintship', 'being', 'right-side', 'law', 'such', 'cops', 'are', 'faced', 'reality', 'political', 'corruption', 'state', 'other', 'side', 'movie', 'endless', 'blood', 'battles', 'claim', 'lives', 'many', 'innocent', 'blacks', 'only', 'crime', 'was', 'possessing', 'dealing', 'using', 'drugs', 'Not', 'government', 'eradicating', 'drugs', 'society', 'creating', 'economic', 'situation', 'conducive', 'financial', 'security', 'state', 'officials', 'could', 'play', 'PR', 'game', 'staying', 'office', 'gaining', 'more', 'power', 'Most', 'dead', 'dying', 'poor', 'blacks', 'have', 'access', 'opportunities', 'glimpse', 'hope', 'could', 'brighten', 'future.The', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'questioning', 'rationale', 'trusting', 'government', 'solve', 'social', 'economic', 'problem', 'creative', 'proactive', 'role', 'public', 'holding', 'governments', 'accountable', 'making', 'enforcing', 'laws', 'could', 'do', 'good', 'people']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 2]","From Training Day and Tears of the Sun director Antoine Fuqua, Brooklyn's Finest revolves around three different cops who have habitually neglected not doing the proverbial right thing.  For patrolman Eddie (Richard Gere), whose close to retirement, he has no illusions as to how cold all the years on the jon has made him, until he gets the chance to make an actual difference.  For Tango (Don Cheadle), his deep undercover work and bevy of empty promises from his superiors make him start questioning his loyalty to the badge, or to the drug kingpin (Wesley Snipes) who has befriended him.  For Sal (Ethan Hawke), corruption has become a necessity as his sickly pregnant wife (Lili Taylor) and family depend on him to move them into a bigger home, and his descent into darkness only proceeds to get deeper and deeper.  While Brooklyn's Finest offers nothing we haven't seen plenty of times before in various other cop dramas, what it does well is provide three separate character studies, leading them all to a shocker of a finale that manages to bring them all together.  Gere is more than solid, but its Cheadle and Hawke who truly shine in their roles, while seeing Wesley Snipes back in a theatrically released big budget film is a welcome sight indeed.  The film is kind of slow moving and a little too long for its own good, but it manages to leave a lasting impression on the viewer, and that alone is a worthwhile accomplishment in itself.

The acting was superb with Westley Snipes, Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle and Richard Gere playing convincing roles. The story was depressing and one that I would call a ""slice of life"" type of movie. There were several stories about the individual cops that brought them to the same physical place toward the end, but not a real central plot that had a beginning and end. It was like looking into the lives of the cops, lives that were pretty depressing to begin with and didn't get much better as the story unfolded. It was a movie where you could see the possibility of a way out or a resolution, but they somehow always missed the mark.The movie was more of a character study of the cops with glimpses into what made them behave in the ways they did. I felt sympathy and some respect for each of them by the end, but felt pretty depressed at their situations. The movie was over 2 hours and seemed a little long at times, but there was plenty of action throughout, a few times shocking enough that it made me jump in my seat.

A film like Training Day represents his best work. Or Tears of the Sun, a movie I have seen 7 times and absolutely adore. His latest effort, Brooklyns Finest doesnt dissapoint at all. Here Fuqua does a bit of Sidney Lumet in the tradition of Prince of the City. While not as compelling as that film or as remarkable it does pay a pretty impressive homage to the genre of films that deal with police corruption. This film is filled with a lot of violence, but not a lot of action. Even when there is action it seems to be played less for thrills and more for realism. As a whole the film is strangely somber and slow, but never dull. Over all this story is pretty familiar territory which brought to mind a lot of other similar films. Numerous movies like Serpico, We own the night, and Narc came to mind, to name a few. Over all an impressive film that handles its subject matter believably. Never utterly predictable, but not what I would consider Antoine Fuquas finest work. Still a pretty great movie.

I felt like it was every bit as good a film as Training Day. Only think lacking was that Denzel Washington tour de force. Nonetheless, this is a good movie in its own right. What else do you expect from a gritty Antoine Fuqua cops vs. drug dealers drama? Brooklyn's Finest proveded everything it should have. The cast is good and well-rounded, even if no one gives a career performance. No, Richard Geere did not phone in his performance! He played a veteran beat cop named Eddie, on his way to retirement, and he did so pretty much as one would expect him to. He was tired, which translates to calm and laid back, and thust seemed like he was ready to hang up his uniform. Tango/Clarence (Don Cheadle) was the star of this one though. He gave the best performance of this film as an undercover that was really deep in the drug game, with a fresh-out-of-prison partner, Caz (the return of Wesley Snipes...and then disappearance again).They shared a chemistry on screen that felt real to me. Rounding out the great actors was Ethan Hawke as Sal. His was my second favorite performance after Cheadle's. He was just hard working family man that got dealt a bad hand in life. I really felt sorry for his character. He showed that desperate side of crooked cops that doesn't get the attention it deserves. A lot of those guys have a lot on their plates, and for the most part, ploice salaries ain't what they should be for the amount of danger those guys are put in. That's what drives them to do the things they do. The best part of this movie is definitely the atmosphere though. The sets don't vary much though. It's basically project housing, titty bars, more project housing and New York streets. Not much else, but it remains gritty and grimey like it should. The sets and cinematography actually set the dark tone wonderfully. And the transfer does a very good job of translating that to our flatscreens.Overall, Brooklyn's Finest is nothing you haven't seen before in any of the cop dramas that came before it, but still I think this movie is definitely worth giving a chance, despite the less than stellar buzz it recieved, and its eventual fizzling out. I mean, from the trailers you should already know what to expect, and it delivers just what it should.

1321686,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0034G4OSG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","&lt;strong>Brooklyn's Finest&lt;/strong> (Antoine Fuqua, 2009)After making a couple of not-widely-seen-but-critically-acclaimed thrillers, Antoine Fuqua stunned the world in 2001 with &lt;em>Training Day&lt;/em>, a tense, tight, completely solid thriller that won Denzel Washington a slew of Best Actor awards, including the Academy's. Fuqua had been Washington's choice to direct, and it looked like Washington had been right; the world was Fuqua's oyster. Then, in quick succession, came &lt;em>Tears of the Sun&lt;/em> (forgettable) and &lt;em>King Arthur&lt;/em> (are you kidding me?). Four years later, &lt;em>Shooter&lt;/em>, which I have been told is actually a very good movie; like almost everyone else, I haven't seen it. Given that track record, the idea of doing &lt;em>Training Day 2&lt;/em> must have haunted Fuqua daily. Enter &lt;em>Sleeper Cell&lt;/em> writer Michael Martin, who had a script that begs every possible comparison with &lt;em>Training Day&lt;/em>, albeit deconstructed--in the same way that you can go to a swanky restaurant and order deconstructed cheesecake and get a smear of cream cheese, a glass of milk, a vanilla bean, and a graham cracker, all artfully arranged on a plate five times the size it needs to be. Which, now that I think about it, is a fantastic way to describe &lt;em>Brooklyn's Finest&lt;/em>. And to put the cherry on top of the deconstructed cheesecake, Fuqua returned to the well, brought Jake Hoyt back, and moved him across the country.Jake Hoyt 2's name is Sal, and he is of course played by Ethan Hawke. He's trying to keep his head above water on a cop's salary in Brooklyn. Not an easy thing to do; some would say impossible, if you're an honest cop. And there are all too many opportunities to become corrupt in his day-to-day existence. Then there are the older, more experienced, guys who kind of act as the angel and the devil balancing out Sal's neutral path: Eddie (Richard Gere), a straight shooter a few days from retirement who finds himself obsessed with a missing young woman, and Tango (Don Cheadle), a guy who's been undercover so long he's starting to identify with the criminals--and who a shady FBI agent (Ellen Barkin) wants to send back in to inform on, and possibly kill, Tango's childhood friend Caz (Wesley Snipes). The three stories run in parallel (and as far as we know, these guys do not know each other), all converging on a single point in time and space.If that cast list, save Cheadle and (arguably) Gere, sounds like a who's-who of nineties movie stars whom you've been wondering about the status of for the last ten years, let me also mention Will Patton (whose career was killed by &lt;em>The Mothman Prophecies&lt;/em>, which almost destroyed Gere's as well), Lili Taylor (the execrable 1999 remake of &lt;em>The Haunting&lt;/em>), and Michael Kennneth Williams (&lt;em>Bringing Out the Dead&lt;/em>). There is a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of talent in this movie, though it never quite coheres the way it should. This is a function of the movie's pace, which in the metaphor above is the five-times-too-big plate; the movie stretches almost two hours and fifteen minutes.

This film was more like a two-hour pilot for a new CBS crime series. (Poor Lili Taylor--how does she get such thankless roles? And Vincent D'Onofrio was wasted. He took time off from Law and Order for this? I hope not.) Gere, whom I like, just seemed to sleepwalk, but who could blame him? The role is so filled with cliches, any TV actor could have played the part. (His attempt at redeeming the ""fallen woman"" was an embarrassment all around, but especially for him.) Don Cheadle does his usual efficient job, but he seemed as eager to be out of this film as his character wants to get out of his undercover assignment.I have to admit the first 15 minutes or so had my interest piqued. Then it lost me. Here and there, usually when Ethan Hawke was on the scene, my ears perked up. His character, with its bow-legged morals, came across as the most credible, both in its writing and Hawke's performance. The rest had me sighing with boredom--it's all been done before.

Integral in taking in this story is the commentary by the director. Whilst the script deals with  three characters and their stories, Sal, Eddie and Tango ( all Policemen), and so the story is that we get to see how hard  it is to be a policeman in Brooklyn. The Director sees all three characters as aspects of one character. For example, Eddie, played by Richard Gere is Numb when we see him, and he goes through stages of development.Tango, played brilliantly and intensively by Don Cheadle, wants to do the right thing, but is cornered by superiors at all points. The Characters all radiate and affect other characters, even as they themselves develop, but the other characters go down in various ways unintentionally.The extras are very good ,they explain many aspects of the core film under development. And it even at one point comes close to paralleling Wesley Snipes real life ( in terms of key change), and probably the most evocative part of the presentation here is that the Director injects a highly spiritual element into what can only be described as some brutal material. The deleted scenes mostlly make sense, but some really should have been retained, however, the art created by the team around the director, and his vision, is so successfully engineered ( if the commentary is true), and Antoine Fuqua has scored another winner.",5,The Finest is Better than Good,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,1569,"['first', 'time', 'writer', 'end', 'result', 'work', 'real', 'life', 'edgy', 'story', 'directed', 'adept', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'great', 'drama', 'touching', 'moments', 'totally', 'brutal', 'moments', 'be', 'real', 'Integral', 'taking', 'story', 'commentary', 'director', 'script', 'deals', 'three', 'characters', 'stories', 'Sal', 'Eddie', 'Tango', 'Policemen', 'so', 'story', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'hard', 'be', 'policeman', 'Brooklyn', 'Director', 'three', 'characters', 'aspects', 'one', 'character', 'example', 'Eddie', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Numb', 'when', 'see', 'stages', 'development.Tango', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'intensively', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'cornered', 'superiors', 'points', 'Characters', 'radiate', 'affect', 'other', 'characters', 'even', 'develop', 'other', 'characters', 'go', 'down', 'various', 'ways', 'unintentionally.The', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'explain', 'many', 'aspects', 'core', 'film', 'development', 'even', 'one', 'point', 'close', 'paralleling', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'real', 'life', 'terms', 'key', 'change', 'probably', 'most', 'evocative', 'part', 'presentation', 'here', 'Director', 'highly', 'spiritual', 'element', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'brutal', 'material', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mostlly', 'make', 'sense', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'retained', 'however', 'art', 'created', 'team', 'director', 'vision', 'so', 'successfully', 'engineered', 'commentary', 'true', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'scored', 'winner']",N/A

The three storylines were rather distinct, and other than by location, they were not linked.  I would have preferred to see more interaction between the characters other than random chance meetings on the street, but I think the storyline still works in the manner in which it was presented.  Additionally, the movie didn't need to be set in Brooklyn, and Brooklyn played no significant part in influencing the storyline, other than providing public housing projects for the drug-ridden backdrop.Onto the movie itself; it's a melancholy drama, depressing and dark.  The cinematography underscores the gritty nature of the BK projects, and the lives of those affected by the drug trade.  The three main characters, Gere, Hawke, and Cheadle, are effective in portraying their respective characters.  Some have said that Cheadle's character was the most sympathetic, but I found all three storylines to be engaging.  Wesley Snipes makes a welcome addition- I think this was Snipes' first movie following his tax evasion sentencing.**SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW**The DVD contains a few deleted scenes, which in my opinion, were rightfully deleted.  One of the scenes shows Don Cheadle's confrontation with the NJ State trooper in more detail.  The deletion of this scene better enhances the tension in Cheadle's character when he describes his inner conflicts to his superior, Bill.  Another one of the deleted scenes ties up some of the loose ends.  Snipes' character is shown alive (unbelievable glad they deleted this) and Richard Gere's character is shown enjoying his retirement in Connecticut.

1321697,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B0034G4OSG,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 2]","I've seen more than enough cop films and initially I wasn't interested in this one. But when I found out Don Cheadle and Richard Gere (two of my favorite actors) were in it, I thought about it and finally gave it a shot. From a woman's perspective, I'm fascinated with how even in the grimiest scenes, both Gere and Cheadle manage to look astoundingly attractive. From a nonsuperficial level, they're both excellent actors, as is the rest of the actors like Ethan Hawke. The guy from ""Waist Deep"" was interesting to watch. I only knew him as the guy who played video games on the couch, but he had a more mature role in here so it was cool to see him grow.The film itself is nothing surprising. One cop, Sal, is frustrated by how much he puts on the line everyday only to make mediocre pay. It's difficult for me to sympathize with him because he chose this job. Then there was Eddie, another cop who just wanted to get through his last week of retirement but meanwhile he's banging the prostitutes that he should be arresting and has a blind eye to just about everything so he can make his retirement. I respected him for standing up to one particular woman, but he was another one that I thought was shady for just letting crime go by to make retirement. The only cop I had any sympathy for was Tango, who was an undercover cop going through so much drama and finding out what it's like to be on the other side of crime. He always seems like he's at a crossroad between completely diving into being a criminal and being an honest cop, and the audience is left wondering which one he likes more.If not for these particular actors, I probably wouldn't have gotten into the film. There's nothing wrong with the way it was written. The direction and filming was excellent. But it just seemed like another day in the hood to me, nothing so shocking that I went ""Wow, this is so unique."" The plot was all right, but the actors were better. However, I actually like the behind-the-scenes story about the director and how he brought inspiration, cameras and jobs to Brooklyn.

But Wesley is really only a costar in Brooklyn's Finest; the real standouts are Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle and Richard Gere.

Because ""Brooklyn's Finest"" (2009) runs 132 minutes, I did not have enough time to watch it first and watched the bonus feature interviews. They did not contain spoilers and made clear the intents of first-time writer Michael C. Martin (who was an MTA toll collector before his screenplay finished second in a competition), director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), and the four lead actors. In addition to having Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, and Ethan Hawke as policemen at the ends of their tethers (and beyond) and Wesley Snipes and Michael K. Williams (The Wire) as gangastas, there are cameos by Ellen Barkin, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Lili Taylor.In the manner of the ""Three Colors Trilogy,"" neither Gere nor Hawke is in the same frame with Cheadle and Snipes more than very briefly. Gere, Hawke, and Cheadle all play Brooklyn policemen, but each in his own story. In intercutting distinct stories, ""Brooklyn's Finest"" is reminiscent of ""The Wire,' and compared to it, 132 minutes is short!. They are similarly urban, gritty, and profane. ""Brooklyn's Finest"" has more (female) nudity, but otherwise looks quite like an HBO melodrama shot on location.None of the three stories or those of subsidiary characters is original. Richard Gere's Eddie  as a beat cop a week away from his retirement and pension, trying to teach a hotheaded newcomer (actually, two, neither as flamboyant as Sean Penn) to let some things pass brings Robert Duvall in ""Colors"" to mind, though Gere is less folksy.  (Add a large dollop of ""Pretty Woman"" from Gere's resum&eacute;.) Cheadle's Tango is under deep cover, with loyalties confused in relation to a drug lord who saved his life (Snipes) is reprising a storyline from the ""Infernal Affairs"" trilogy, Americanized as ""The Departed,"" and other tales of undercover operatives. And Snipes has been a drug lord before (New Jack City).As a father of three (or more) whose wife Angela (Lili Taylor in harried but sweet mode)  is pregnant with twins and whose asthma is worsened by mold in the walls of their house... which means desperate to move, narcotics detective Sal (Hawke) becomes a cop appropriated drug money for himself. In confession, he wishes for God's protection rather than forgiveness. Throughout the movie, he agonizes about crossing the line, which puzzles me in that he commits first-degree murder in the first scene. He is not just a ""dirty cop,"" but also a murderer (I won't specify how many times). Not as cynical as either ""Bad Lieutenant"" and not addicted to drugs, and more distraught, but it's for the family, you know?In addition to the interview-centered bonus features, there are a lot of deleted scenes (about half an hour in total), a trailer, and trailers for four other movies, none of which made me want to see the movies. ""Boyz n the Real Hood,"" which is about shooting on location in dicey Brownsville, Brooklyn locations, is especially interesting.I'd rate the movie 3-3.5.5 stars, but the bonus features easily round up a rating of the package to 4.  (I have not listened to the commentary track.) The locations and cast are outstanding, the juxtaposition of stories is well done. Ethan Hawke is very different here than in ""Training Day,"" suppressing his usual charm and occasional innocence. I think that Martin meant his character to be more sympathetic than I found it. Gere is very good at burned-out yet a defender of the weak. Is Cheadle ever not good? Snipes has been not good in recent years, but has two moments of great screen acting (with the face, not with dialogue or movement) herein.",4,"Three oft-told stories juxtaposed, heading to disaster",1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,3639,"['Often', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'convince', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', '2009', '132', 'minutes', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'watch', 'first', 'watched', 'bonus', 'feature', 'interviews', 'did', 'not', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'made', 'clear', 'intents', 'first-time', 'writer', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Martin', 'who', 'was', 'MTA', 'toll', 'collector', 'screenplay', 'finished', 'second', 'competition', 'director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'Training', 'Day', 'four', 'lead', 'actors', 'addition', 'having', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'policemen', 'ends', 'tethers', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Michael', 'K.', 'Williams', 'Wire', 'gangastas', 'are', 'cameos', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Lili', 'Taylor.In', 'manner', 'Three', 'Colors', 'Trilogy', 'Gere', 'Hawke', 'same', 'frame', 'Cheadle', 'Snipes', 'more', 'very', 'briefly', 'Gere', 'Hawke', 'Cheadle', 'play', 'Brooklyn', 'policemen', 'own', 'story', 'intercutting', 'distinct', 'stories', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'reminiscent', 'Wire', 'compared', '132', 'minutes', 'short', 'are', 'similarly', 'urban', 'gritty', 'profane', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'more', 'female', 'nudity', 'otherwise', 'quite', 'HBO', 'melodrama', 'shot', 'location.None', 'three', 'stories', 'subsidiary', 'characters', 'original', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Eddie', 'beat', 'cop', 'week', 'away', 'retirement', 'pension', 'trying', 'teach', 'hotheaded', 'newcomer', 'actually', 'two', 'as', 'flamboyant', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'let', 'things', 'pass', 'brings', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Colors', 'mind', 'Gere', 'less', 'folksy', 'large', 'dollop', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Gere', 'resum', 'eacute', 'Cheadle', 'Tango', 'deep', 'cover', 'loyalties', 'confused', 'relation', 'drug', 'lord', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'Snipes', 'reprising', 'storyline', 'Infernal', 'Affairs', 'trilogy', 'Americanized', 'Departed', 'other', 'tales', 'undercover', 'operatives', 'Snipes', 'been', 'drug', 'lord', 'New', 'Jack', 'City', '.As', 'father', 'three', 'more', 'wife', 'Angela', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'harried', 'sweet', 'mode', 'pregnant', 'twins', 'asthma', 'worsened', 'mold', 'walls', 'house', 'desperate', 'move', 'narcotics', 'detective', 'Sal', 'Hawke', 'cop', 'appropriated', 'drug', 'money', 'confession', 'God', 'protection', 'rather', 'forgiveness', 'movie', 'crossing', 'line', 'first-degree', 'murder', 'first', 'scene', 'not', 'just', 'dirty', 'cop', 'also', 'murderer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'specify', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Not', 'as', 'cynical', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'not', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'more', 'distraught', 'family', 'know', 'addition', 'interview-centered', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'lot', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'hour', 'total', 'trailer', 'trailers', 'four', 'other', 'movies', 'none', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'movies', 'Boyz', 'Real', 'Hood', 'shooting', 'location', 'dicey', 'Brownsville', 'Brooklyn', 'locations', 'especially', 'interesting.I', ""'d"", 'rate', 'movie', '3-3.5.5', 'stars', 'bonus', 'easily', 'round', 'up', 'rating', 'package', '4', 'have', 'not', 'listened', 'commentary', 'track', 'locations', 'cast', 'are', 'outstanding', 'juxtaposition', 'stories', 'well', 'done', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'very', 'different', 'here', 'Training', 'Day', 'suppressing', 'usual', 'charm', 'occasional', 'innocence', 'think', 'Martin', 'meant', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'found', 'Gere', 'very', 'good', 'burned-out', 'yet', 'defender', 'weak', 'Cheadle', 'ever', 'not', 'good', 'Snipes', 'been', 'not', 'good', 'recent', 'years', 'two', 'moments', 'great', 'screen', 'acting', 'face', 'not', 'dialogue', 'movement', 'herein']",N/A

On one hand it was a moody police drama, then it was a character study, then it was an action movie, and then it was philosophical drama. Handled dextrously it could have worked, but instead it was like watching the deformed love child ofCrash,Six Degrees of Separation, and a low-budget indie police action drama.The movie follows the lives of three very (but ultimately not-so) different Brooklyn police officers through their choices, for better or worse, and shows us the consequences. The acting overall was competent--some stronger than others; the performances by Don Cheadle and Ethan Hawke were commendable, whereas Richard Gere and Wesley Snipes phoned it in.But I can't blame them because the scripting was questionable. While there were some gems in the writing, the dialogue also felt stiff, sometimes random, and incongruous throughout. Pacing was sluggish and editing left many gratuitous and protracted violence and sex scenes. (Note that I have no problem with sex or violence as long as it advances the story or character(s) in some way.)It wasn't all bad though. The mood set throughout the film--accomplished by the excellent lighting, coloring, and angles--dug its way into me and refused to let go. Still, it wasn't enough to redeem this film. When it finished I was left more confused than entertained or pensive.

Add to that some nice work from Ellen Barkin, Will Patton, and an excellent cameo by Vincent D'Onofrio and there is no way to fault the cast.  Antoine Fuqua directed the movie; he was also the director of 2001's ""Training Day"".  With such an array of talen, it is highly unfortunate that ""Brookyn's Finest"" isn't a better movie.It might seem easy to blame the screenplay.  Michael C. Martin is the first-time screenwriter responsible for what seems like a collection of cop action/drama cliches.  His only other writing credit is an episode of ""Sleeper Cell.""  But it's very difficult sometimes to say what changes were made to a screenplay throughout the production.  Often a solid screenplay gets chopped up, rewritten, and just generally messed around with by the time we see the final product onscreen.  What ends up as the final cut of the movie is very often something considerably different than what was written on the page.The deleted scenes, included with the special features, are fairly illuminating as there are a few sequences that probably deserved to be left in.  Some strong acting and character-deepening scenes can be found with Gere and Hawke.  Fuqua's director's commentary is interesting and insightful.  The featurette I appreciated most was ""From the MTA to the WGA"" which focuses on screenwriter Martin and his journey from being a subway worker turned screenwriter.  They say the writer gets screwed, and in this case that is sadly true.  I think that Michael C.

Narcotics officer Sal Procida (Ethan Hawke) has discovered there's no line he won't cross to provide a better life for his wife and seven kids.  Clarence ""Tango"" Butler (Don Cheadle) has been undercover so long his loyalties have started to shift from his fellow cops to his prison buddy Caz (Wesley Snipes), one of Brooklyn's most notorious drug dealers.When the NYPD's Operation Clean Up targets a drug-ridden housing project, Eddie, Sal, and Tango find themselves drawn to the same fatal crime scene.Though the plot is overly familiar and the script often cliched, the three leads elevate the film with superb performances.  They believably convey the stress each is under as a working police officer, though the source of the stress differs from one to the other, and director Antoine Fuqua captures the grittiness and danger of a day in the life of a cop.Bonus extras on both the Blu-ray and DVD versions include audio commentary with director Fuqua, the featurettes ""Chaos & Conflict: The Life of a New York Cop"" and ""Boyz N The Real Hood,"" and deleted scenes.",4,"Gritty Police Drama, First-Rate Acting",1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,1217,"['Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'burned-out', 'veteran', 'cop', 'Eddie', 'Dugan', 'just', 'one', 'week', 'away', 'pension', 'fishing', 'cabin', 'Connecticut', 'Narcotics', 'officer', 'Sal', 'Procida', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'discovered', 'line', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cross', 'provide', 'better', 'life', 'wife', 'seven', 'kids', 'Clarence', 'Tango', 'Butler', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'been', 'undercover', 'so', 'long', 'loyalties', 'have', 'started', 'shift', 'fellow', 'cops', 'prison', 'buddy', 'Caz', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'one', 'Brooklyn', 'most', 'notorious', 'drug', 'NYPD', 'Operation', 'Clean', 'Up', 'drug-ridden', 'housing', 'project', 'Eddie', 'Sal', 'Tango', 'find', 'drawn', 'same', 'fatal', 'crime', 'plot', 'overly', 'familiar', 'script', 'often', 'cliched', 'three', 'leads', 'elevate', 'film', 'superb', 'performances', 'believably', 'convey', 'stress', 'working', 'police', 'officer', 'source', 'stress', 'differs', 'one', 'other', 'director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'grittiness', 'danger', 'day', 'life', 'cop.Bonus', 'extras', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'versions', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Fuqua', 'featurettes', 'Chaos', 'Conflict', 'Life', 'New', 'York', 'Cop', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Real', 'Hood', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

""Brooklyn's Finest"" is an example.  I would not recommend this to the squeamish, timid, easily offended, or casual viewer.  It is a bleak, demanding, brutal, and drapily realistic hardboiled cop movie where nobody, and I mean nobody, comes out clean.It is a coalescing story about three New York cops (Richard Gere's burnout on the verge of retirement cop Eddie; Don Cheadle's deep undercover agent Tango; and Ethan Hawkes' haunted, sanity-is-slipping-away vice officer) who witness tragedy, experience some debilitating personal pain and trauma that feels all to real, and who meet with brutal ends (save for one but I won't give that away).  It's enough to make you almost want to be a gangster as it seems that their lives aren't that hard or messed up!  I'm just saying that this movie won't do anything for police recruitment.That acting is very good and believable, the movie maintains a singular intensity (Hawke is spectacular), and the ending is a firm conclusion though it may not satisfy.  I'd encourage you to avoid this if you're in a depressed mood.  Otherwise, if you like hardboiled, bloody, hardhitting and hardbitten cop features then this one is for you.3.5 stars.",3,Punishing.

1321710,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B0034G4OSG,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[3, 5]","Movie - 4.5To this day, I have to be honest and say I've had very little, if any respect for police officers. They appear nice so they can fit the bill as civil servants, and it's re-assuring to believe they're doing something to ""protect and serve."" But when it comes down to it, more often than not, it feels like most officers (the common ones for traffic violations and domestic disturbance) lack any kind of subtlety, tact, and real ability to make judgment calls for the greater good when it truly matters. I'm sure I speak some truth for a good majority of people who've gotten tickets or witnessed a ticket being given for some stupid or asinine reason that only resulted in ill will toward the officer, his quota of tickets being met, and a ruined day for the victim. A few movies spring to mind when addressing the issue of corruption within the police force, but most often for me, Lakeview Terrace and Antoine Fuqua's last effort in Training Day. We all know crooked cops are out there abusing power, bullying people, and making lives miserable, but Fuqua creates an amazing inverse effect here in Brooklyn's Finest. The film is essentially about 3 cops with 3 different paths and all of the hardships they've faced to their eventual breaking points. It's a dark, gritty, and emotionally-charged piece of work that really opened my eyes to just how hard it is to live with the scrutiny of being a cop, doing what's right, and the fine line that exists between good and bad, all while being on some sort of proverbial edge, be it poverty, loss of identity, or the desensitization of life in general. The movie itself starts off with a bang and literally just builds up the tension from there till all 3 cops cross each other by the end. Thanks to some fine writing by Michael Mitchell and a great cast in Gere, Cheadle, and Hawke, the movie results in a great layout. But I have to say my biggest surprise is in the return of Wesley Snipes. Making his first theatrical appearance since Blade: Trinity, it's good to see he's still got some screen presence and that he can really perform when given a good script and director. Kudos to Fuqua for handpicking him and making such an incredible film that has certainly earned my respect for only the finest men in law enforcement, but also raised my hatred for the bad ones.Video - 4.5Brooklyn's Finest looks quite excellent on this BD by Starz / Anchor Bay. I've never actually been to Brooklyn, but a lot of the colors and imagery captured in the cinematography give the entire movie a very lifelike, yet visceral quality. It's a very vibrant and sharp picture that I personally feel reflects the story, characters, and film's progression very well. Flesh tones look especially natural, and surrounding colors within the settings and props do a great job adding a sense of depth and dimensionality that really gives it that HD pop. Black levels are deep and inky with a good amount of shadow delineation amongst the more darkly-lit scenes, providing for easy discernability between people, objects, and backgrounds. Contrast is perfect as well and makes for a particularly resolute image in a lot of the closeup shots of actors' faces and their attire. Being the character drama that it is, it may seem strange, but my favorite scenes are the solo shots of the 3 cops with their faces directly to the camera in some for or another. Just seeing their facial expressions and reactions in such clarity really made the acting and story that much more powerful and articulate. The only problem I have with the presentation is the heavy amount of red lighting during Gere's scenes with his lady-friend. Not that it's a bad transfer, but the lighting itself can kind of irritate your eyes after a while. Other than that, the video quality is nearly flawless.Audio - 4.5The audio quality, much like the video, is near-reference. For a cop movie, there's actually not a whole lot of shooting till around the middle and end. With that said, the majority of the movie with its dialogue is clean and free of any distortion from the center channel. Ambient sound effects do an admirable job separating and panning respectively from the fronts and rears adding more of that Brooklyn immersion. The film's score and music supervision from the various night clubs offer an equally immersive experience and even pack some healthy LFEs from the heavier bass pieces. High and low ends are handled well between the background noises of the projects, the inside of apartments / complexes, and occasional vehicle racket. Gunshots and fisticuffs come off accurate with a very nice oomph and are probably the best aspects of the audio to compliment the corresponding intensity of the photography. This is another excellent effort from Starz / Anchor Bay.Extras - 4.0There isn't much in terms of extras other than a commentary by director Antoine Fuqua, about 30 minutes of behind-the-scenes coverage, and 30 minutes of deleted scenes. First off is the great commentary by Fuqua. He basically covers all the characters roles, their motives, what he was trying to convey through them, and what he ultimately wanted to show in this film's depiction about the hardships I mentioned above. It's a very informative commentary that shed a lot light, and he's quite the film-maker you can really tell is passionate about his work. The b-t-s footage more or less covers the film's premise, its inception on paper, how Fuqua came to direct, and the filming process. It makes for some pretty basic, bare-bones explanation, but makes you appreciate the attention to detail taken by Fuqua and his crew to actually go through the trouble of filming in Brooklyn and as close as they could to the projects without getting into trouble. He even went out of his way to cast people and civilians living around the area to add an extra level of authenticity, which is cool in my book. The deleted scenes, however, caught me by surprise the most. Normally, deleted scenes compose of snips and edits that probably just didn't make the movie flow as well. Here, it actually adds to the story and even makes for some very revealing plot points that, for whatever reason, I think should've been left intact. I won't spoil them, but I do recommend you give them a watch after the film, as there are some really good scenes not being used, there.Overall - 4.5I love what Antoine Fuqua did in Training Day: showing hopeful naivety, the rotten state of the world, and the thin line that separates a cop from doing great or terrible things because of those circumstances. He takes somewhat of an inverted approach here in Brooklyn's Finest by showing audiences that genuinely good cops do exist and that, even at their finest moments, don't get the respect they deserve because the world is indeed as jaded and messed up as we think it is. Brooklyn's Finest is a tough movie, and even a little disheartening if you think about it. But whatever you decide to take it as, it's still another finely-crafted film by one of my increasingly favorite directors. Presented with near-reference A/V quality and a deceptively sparse, but informative set of extras, Brooklyn's Finest comes highly recommended for cop movie fans.",5,Brooklyn's Finest

Overall a very good cop movie.,4,Brooklyn's Finest,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,361,"['Very', 'Good', 'Movie', 'Kept', 'edge', 'most', 'way', 'bit', 'slow', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'will', 'blow', 'mind', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'One', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'best', 'performances', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'performance', 'greatly', 'as', 'well', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'usual', 'edge', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'Overall', 'very', 'good', 'cop', 'movie']",N/A
1321713,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0034G4OSG,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Brooklyn's Finest"" consists of three unconnected stories. Each story features a policeman, and they all are in some sort of trouble: Salvatore ""Sal"" Procida (Ethan Hawke), a corrupt detective who really needs money for his family; Eddie Dugan (Richard Gere), a tired veteran officer, just one week before his retirement; and Clarence ""Tango"" Butler (Don Cheadle) an undercover officer who thinks he has been working undercover for too long. They are all in desperate situations in different ways, and they are all in need of some help.""Brooklyn's Finest"" benefits from strong performances from the actors (including Wesley Snipes as drug dealer and Br&iacute;an F. O'Byrne as Sal's fellow officer), and the real Brooklyn locations give credibility to the film, of which screenplay (by Michael C. Martin), however, suffers from all too familiar storylines and stock characters of the genre, as well as the underwhelming climax that look contrived.Antoine Fuqua did a better job in ""Training Day"" (with Ethan Hawke as a rookie cop), a taut thriller in which human morality plays a vital role. In ""Brooklyn's Finest"" characters also face a moral dilemma and have to make a decision on their own, but the process and the conclusions lack tension, despite the best efforts from the cast.See ""Brooklyn's Finest"" for the charismatic acting of the three leads.",3,"See the Film for the charismatic acting from Don Cheadle, Richard Gere and Ethan Hawke",1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,1353,"['Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'three', 'unconnected', 'stories', 'story', 'policeman', 'are', 'sort', 'trouble', 'Salvatore', 'Sal', 'Procida', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'corrupt', 'detective', 'who', 'really', 'money', 'family', 'Eddie', 'Dugan', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'tired', 'veteran', 'officer', 'just', 'one', 'week', 'retirement', 'Clarence', 'Tango', 'Butler', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'undercover', 'officer', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'undercover', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'desperate', 'situations', 'different', 'ways', 'are', 'need', 'help', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'benefits', 'strong', 'performances', 'actors', 'including', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Br', 'iacute', 'F.', ""O'Byrne"", 'Sal', 'fellow', 'officer', 'real', 'Brooklyn', 'locations', 'give', 'credibility', 'film', 'screenplay', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Martin', 'however', 'suffers', 'too', 'familiar', 'storylines', 'stock', 'characters', 'genre', 'as', 'well', 'underwhelming', 'climax', 'look', 'contrived.Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'Training', 'Day', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'rookie', 'cop', 'taut', 'thriller', 'human', 'morality', 'vital', 'role', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'characters', 'also', 'face', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'have', 'make', 'decision', 'own', 'process', 'conclusions', 'lack', 'tension', 'best', 'efforts', 'cast.See', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'charismatic', 'acting', 'three', 'leads']",N/A
