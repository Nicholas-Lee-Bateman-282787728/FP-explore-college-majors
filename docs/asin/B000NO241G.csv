King: The THRILL is GONE...What was once a GREAT series (included here, hence my 4 STARS) has sadly become ""We're only in it for the $$$$$.""Even reformatting the series has only led to the feeling that everyone involved is WALKING ON EGGS thinking ""GOLLY! I SURE HOPE WE DON'T *OFFEND* ANYONE..."" And with almost every new episode taking place in Denver or Colorado Springs, it's increasingly apparent that the DOG POUND HAS WORN OUT IT'S WELCOME IN HAWAII.This, coupled with it's legendary PREDICTABLITY (""YOU SON OF A B**** MO-FO, I'M GONNA KICK YOUR A**!!!/OH, CHANGE. FIND JESUS. HAVE A CIGARETTE. CALL YOUR MOTHER. WE LOVE YOU! WE'RE YOUR BEST BUDS!"" BY THE END OF *EVERY EPISODE) has SUNK IT. It's on LIFE SUPPORT. (HAVE MERCY! PLEASE PULL THE PLUG!)Buy this, but stop here. Watching the DOG waste away will just make you MADDER, SADDER and POORER.If you want THE SERIES that's WHAT DTBH *USED TO BE* then tune in to OPERACION REPO! THAT TEAM IS ROCKING - AND REMOTELY *PREDICTABLE* IT AIN'T!",4,Sorry.

The only flaw to this product is that the seasons aren't full seasons. I knew that I was buying ""best of"" seasons, by the way, but this product left me wanting more and that is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. Like Dog? Buy this product (it comes with the wedding special). Curious about the show?

It realy tugged at my heart when dog walked behind that wall and looked at the preacher and said  MY little baby died and he started crying. You can see the love that he and Beth have for their childred.
