1153415,AT1EGRXDI3NUK,B0016I0AGY,Amazon Customer,"[18, 18]","Well, here we are finally, at the release of the famous dream season.  Now, after my last review where I got down on the last season, I found upon re-watching it that it was really quite good-I think all of Dallas is brilliant in it's way really.  So, this season is different to be sure-Leonard Katzman was gone and the style of the show went very glamorous, very Dynasty-esque, and it is not at all like Dallas of before or after in many ways.  Lucy is gone and that doesn't matter of course, but Bobby is also gone and that does indeed make a difference.  The season itself has of course been hampered in retrospect by the fact that we now know none of it really happens.  Nevertheless, there are still plenty of interesting twists and turns that keep the season good dramatically.  The only question is how you will react to the different ways that the characters speak and act, and that I've found is more a matter of personal taste than anything else.  I am not going to lie that this is probably my least favorite season of the show for these reasons I've listed above-but it still beats almost anything else from other shows, and it's still Dallas so it gets 5 stars, especially after I was pleasantly surprised by my re-viewing of the last season on DVD.

1153417,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B0016I0AGY,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[7, 7]","I am a huge 'Dallas' fan and yet I find myself on the fence about this Ninth Season. When stacked up against the previous seasons released, the ninth is just strange, oddly paced and not as exciting and thrilling as the previous ones. Is it good? Yes, of course, but it's just an average good, not the 'great' stamp you could put on the other seasons.What you'll like about The Ninth Season is how we finally get a break from all the 'fight for Ewing Oil' saga. There is a plot element of this season that I won't spoil that has someone new moving into Bobby's now vacant office, but I never really perceived this as a fight for control as in the previous seasons. With Bobby out of the picture, the show seemed to shift the focus from the Ewing men to the Ewing women. Did it work? I thought so. Linda Gray's performance early on in this season is just beyond words. We get to see Sue Ellen's descent into pure drunkdom and how she falls to pieces as a result. I liked that Miss Ellie (played again by Barbara Bel Geddes) steps in this season and instead of always being whisked away by Clayton to some exotic vacation as in the previous seasons, Miss Ellie stays put at Southfork and realizes that she needs to keep everyone in line. We see a very strong, determined, motherly but wise Miss Ellie pretty much set everyone straight. The other women of the show including Donna, Pam and Jenna all have rather big plot arcs that dominate the season. The show even added a femme fatal character, Angelica Nero, to shake things up. I enjoyed the break from the usual oil and fight for the business plots and the focus being on the family and the characters as they cope with Bobby's lost and try to find new paths and directions in their lives.What you won't like is the pacing. I found this season to be rather uneven, unfocused, always seeming to shift and switch to different  plots which left me as a viewer feeling jarred and confused. I still don't really understand the entire Angelica Nero plot; she seemed to be added in just to wear fancy clothes and threaten J.R. and Jack Ewing. Then we have Pam in the middle of the season going off to Colombia ... something else that left me wishing the focus of the show stayed on the city and happenings in and around Dallas, Texas. Sue Ellen's sobriety seemed to come too quickly from her departure from the sanatorium. There is also a point in the season where things that happened early on seem to be forgotten; Sue Ellen's re-adjusted quickly and not speaking of her early-season troubles, J.R. oddly goes from wanting to do away with Sue Ellen to being obsessed with re-capturing her heart, Jenna is over-the-top obsessed with Bobby until the final episodes of the season ... it was just confusing and a jumble of plots and odd behaviors and plots.I won't touch the final episode of the season 'Blast from the Past' though many have already spoiled it. I think it's that episode that really leaves me on the fence about this season. The show appeared to have taken a big chance with many characters and even some plots such as Donna and Ray's pregnancy/child situation, but one episode pretty much undoes it all. An entire season of development, of confrontations such as one between Pam and Jenna that was a major twist, or Cliff finally coming to respect Jamie, undone to be re-written for the next season. Depending on your take of the season, it may have been a good or bad thing.In all, this season was just okay for me. It is fun to watch knowing that it's a dream because there are sudden hints and allusions dropped throughout the season that hint that most of this is just a dream. There was a grittier feel to at least half the season - the second half felt more soap opera, over-the-top like similar to 'Dynasty' rather than having the drama edge of the past seasons. I also felt the quality of the DVD transfer could have been a bit better. In all, good, but not a great season.

Meanwhile, we get the late Dack Rambo filling in a bit for Duffy as the macho good guy Jack Ewing; Barbara Bel Geddes returning as Miss Ellie (after a season's absence, during which the role was played by Donna Reed); and guest star Barbara Carerra, exotic, mysterious, and flamboyantly dressed as Angelica Nero.

1153421,A26NSW219HUIL0,B0016I0AGY,Christian Montaque,"[1, 2]","I only ever watched the season-ending cliffhangers of Dallas when it originally aired, not really being a fan of the programme; but I have been having an absolute ball going through each season of Dallas on DVD!!Even so, season nine is definitely a lesser season: in acting, plotting, pacing, music cues. More on this later. But first, let me quickly add that this novel of seasons is a revisionist's dream. I was aware that this was the infamous dream season, so unlike the rest of the world who watched its original airing, I knew all of this was in Pam's head. And that is how I viewed the entire season, as if the producers had intentionally planned all along that everything we were going to see in season nine was just Pam's subconscious at work, the night after having sex with Bobby, her great love, who was engaged to Jenna. This was her dreamscape.Pam simply dreaming - sometimes fitfully, obviously - is a great explanation for some of the character development and resurrections, dialogue, plot meandering, and other faults with this season. When she goes missing in Colombia, JR expresses two reasons to find her: 1 - he fears no one would believe he wasn't behind her death/disappearance if his plot with Cantrell ever came to light; 2 - he says he'd never be able to look himself in the mirror if anything ever happened to Pam. HA! The first is definitely JR to the core; the latter is Pam's subconscious' fantasy. The whole emerald mine is a woman's fantasy, so that fits in as a dream; as does the resurrection of a recent flame, her friend Sue Ellen falling once again to alcoholism and JR's arms, the new Ewing relations not being fully-fleshed out (or very interesting) characters, a meandering Ewing Oil plot for someone not completely involved in the oil business, and her brother reigning in his self-destructive tendencies to destroy JR. It all plays out like a dream. Perfect!What's not perfect: Dack Rambo's acting, worse than Jenilee's and equal to Presley's. The man had the fakest laugh and smile. Too bad, because he was not bad to look at. Neither was Marc Singer, shirtless. But both were such posers! And while Nero's acting was mostly passable, her assistant's acting abilities appeared to zombify right before our very eyes as her time drew to a close. Yikes!Ray and Donna often suffer as characters, their dialogue usually two-fingers deep, but the actors did a fine job for the most part, with a couple of deeply moving story-lines (and Tony was great! sorry to lose him to the alarm clock).But the best episodes, meaning the best acted/scripted/paced/scored/etc. came at the last fifth of the season, the last 6 episodes. Interestingly, the entire season picked up at this point with a major push of 'happy' story-lines. In fact, I think episode 24 was almost nothing but good, warm feelings throughout. And then the cliffhangers were some of the best ever: killing Jamie? killing Sue Ellen? Bobby in the shower!Awesome.If I had been a fan of the programme during its original airing, this season may have put a cap on my viewing. As it stands now, it is worth it, even as a mere exercise in the study of dreams. And I gotta tell ya, I love the idea of wiping the slate clean and starting fresh with alternate story-lines. That's so cool!But only in hindsight. And only once.

Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[29, 34]","""Dallas"" Season 9 (1985-86)  begins with final goodbyes to Bobby as the Ewing clan come together to pay their respects.  This season sees the departure of Patrick Duffy, as Bobby, and the  return of the much beloved Barbara Belle Geddes, as she reprises her role as Miss Ellie. Donna Reed, of course, exits the show,  and new faces abound as Jenilee Harrison (Three's Company) as Jamie Ewing Barnes, Dack Rambo as Jack Ewing, Marc Singer as Matt Cantrell, and John Beck returns as Mark Graison.  As mentioned in the previous reviews, ""Season 9"" is Pam Ewing's ""dream season,"" and is quiet enjoyable in it's storyline and characters.  The return of Patrick Duffy as Bobby Ewing in the following season, was no doubt an attempt to boost the shows TV ratings and put it back in the top spot.  ""Dallas"" fans have seen ""the best"" of the series with these 9 season sets, with the shows producers and directors loosing the show's identity with far-fetched shcemes and over-the-top glamour that strays way too far from the original formula that made ""Dallas"" the traditional TV drama that viewers loved to endulge themselves in.  The original formula of TV's ""Dallas"" guaranteed the viewer a season filled with fun and creative storylines which remained in a believable setting that the viewer had not only become familiar with, but enjoyed looking forward to the suspense and drama that came with each episodes deals, plots, and schemes!

Admittedly, many (if not all) Dallas fans were deeply conflicted about the show's attempt at adding a bit of gloss to the sudsy goings-on at Southfork. The void left in the wake of Patrick Duffy's departure would be felt throughout the season despite the extra testosterone supplied by Dack Rambo, Marc Singer and the return of John Beck. Interestingly enough, the show's original premise was to have Bobby die following his wedding to Pam, leaving the grieving widow to deal with the Ewings. And while the powers-that-be kept flirting with the idea (Mr. Hagman certainly played it this way for most of the show's run), even going so far this season as to set the perfect stage - the battle between Pam and JR never quite materializes - ill-veiled threats from both sides notwithstanding. While most of the new ideas meant to revitalize the show ultimately caused a kind of dissonance to its brand, they, at the least, made this particular season stand out. Frankly, had I been faced with trying to create excitement for the show at this point, why bother with Angelica Nero? I'd have negotiated a cross-over storyline with Dynasty. Imagine JR and Alexis playing a corporate ""Strangers on a Train"" deal of you destroy my enemy and I'll destroy yours. Nielsen would've blown a fuse! But I digress.

1153431,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B0016I0AGY,Kasey G,"[2, 4]","**NOTE - This review contains Spoilers**Season 9 of ""Dallas"" ran on CBS during the 1985-86 TV season and has becomes infamous as the ""dream season"" in which Bobby turns up in the shower in the finale negating everything that has transpired in the past 31 episodes.Patrick Duffy's departure becomes the death knell for the series as it never fully recovers. Even the return of Barbara Bel Geddes can't reverse the trend.""Special Guest Star"" Barbara Carrera is a colossal bore as the exotic Angelica Nero, who works for a Greek shipping magnate and has a special interest in cousin Jack (Dack Rambo) who bears a strong resemblance to the ailing tycoon of Marinos Shipping. This is one of the most boring plots ever on ""Dallas"" and Carrera seems better suited to ""Dynasty"" with her gold lame gowns, capes and turbans overpowering every scene she's in.J.R. is less sadistic this season and seems to be softening a bit. When he learns of Mandy's betrayal, how does he punish her? By personally handing her the title to the deluxe condo, that's how! If Afton had done the same thing a few seasons back, he would have kicked her to the curb faster than you can say ""offshore drilling"". J.R. does put the screws to the cartel once again, and he and Sue Ellen start another custody battle for John Ross but it's all a big case of ""been-there-done-that"".Pam discovers Mark Graison (John Beck) still alive, having staged his death earlier, and the two decide to marry. Pam also jumps ship from Barnes-Wentworth for Ewing Oil when she inherits Bobby's shares. The reading of the will is one of the season's best scenes.Dack Rambo assumes the ""good-guy"" role vacated by Duffy but is a poor substitute, and teaming him with Priscilla Presley, easily the worst actress on the show, does him no favours. The writers even unsuccessfully try and play him up to the audience, with dialogue like ""women just flock to him"".Deborah Shelton is still on board as J.R.'s mistress Mandy Winger and continues to underwhelm, though she's not as annoying as Jenna and daughter Charlie (they aren't even related by marriage, so why are they living at Southfork?).Even Jamie (Jenilee Harrison) has become dull this season, spending a good portion of it in a sick-bed after marrying Cliff and suffering a workplace accident. Her survival depends on locating a rare blood type, but will a donor be found in time?Marc Singer appears as Bobby's old pal Matt Cantrell who needs Pam to help finance his emerald-mining operation in Columbia. Pam accompanies him there and ends up being kidnapped in the jungle. Singer's Beastmaster body and 9th-grade-nerd voice make for an odd combination and the only really interesting thing about this plotline is it also features Alejandro Rey (""The Flying Nun"") as a corrupt Columbian police chief.Steve Forrest appears as new mature ranch hand Ben Stivers, who seems to have a keen interest in Miss Ellie for some reason. This storyline doesn't really blossom until next season.Clayton tries to keep his financial problems from Miss Ellie, but she finds out and secretly starts buying up the companies he's trying to unload.There are only two storylines that make this season worthwhile. Donna learns she's pregnant, but that the child has Down's syndrome (her reaction scene is perhaps Susan Howard's best work on the series), and she and Ray agonize over making the right decision. Sue Ellen hits rock bottom and ends up swilling cheap wine on skid row with derelicts in her designer duds before she's committed once again to a sanitarium. Linda Gray gives a no-holds barred performance during her freak-out scenes in the drunk tank and hospital. They're definitely the highlight of the season. (One of the hookers asks her mockingly ""What'ya starin' at honey? My slip showin'?""). Another hilarious moment occurs when Sue Ellen wakes up in a sleazy, roach-trap of a motel room and tells the cleaning lady, straight-faced ""I'd like to have a Bloody Mary sent up""). With some help from the returning Dusty (Jared Martin), Sue Ellen turns her life around and gets a job as fundraiser for Mark Graison's medical research center, becoming involved with her boss, Dr. Kenderson.Once again, we get dual-sided discs. The picture quality is very good and the episodes all contain the original 80s Lorimar closing logo. *Trivia Note* Episode #23 ""Sitting Ducks"" was directed by Susan Howard (Donna Krebbs).While many fans made a big stink about Donna Reed in Season 8, THIS is the first season of ""Dallas"" that made me hold my nose. Completists and fans of Donna Krebbs and Sue Ellen will want to see this for some of their best moments, others should just be like Pam and pretend it was all a lousy bad dream and skip this one.",3,Worthwhile Only For Fans of Sue Ellen and Donna,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,4722,"['**NOTE', 'review', 'Spoilers**Season', '9', 'Dallas', 'ran', 'CBS', '1985-86', 'TV', 'season', 'becomes',

1153433,A163N66ALZDACR,B0016I0AGY,LBloom,"[1, 1]","I actually liked this season a little better than season 8. Once we get past the episodes about Bobby's passing and Sue Ellen's drinking it becomes fairly enjoyable.The first few episodes have JR unfairly lashing out at Sue Ellen, Dusty and everyone else over Bobby's death. This seems a bit contrived or something to me. After all this is the ninth season that we have had to suffer through JR and Sue Ellen's most recent separation, divorce and custody battle and reconciliation. The episode that begins with Sue Ellen having a nightmare about being chased through the woods is bit much. Thankfully, they finally have Sue Ellen drying out and at least we have the impression that things can go forward in a different direction as this recurring conflict between JR and Sue Ellen had become dangerously close to self parody.This season did seem to offer an attempt to go forward in a different direction. Bobby's death, Pam taking his place at Ewing Oil, Mark Graison's return, Sue Ellen drying out, etc. Only a few of the story lines seem kind of far fetched or just plain dumb.The Emerald mine story seemed just plain dumb; as if Pam, after being sent on a wild goose chase last season to find Mark Graison who is presumed dead will suddenly venture to the jungles of South America for what ever reason she went there. Surprisingly, it seemed to make sense that upon her return she decides to sell JR her shares of Ewing Oil, thus giving JR what he's always wanted anyway, as well as Pam ridding herself of what she seemed to feel caused the all of the family's problems. JR has always been the only one who actually cared about the company anyway. This would also end the tiresome worn out, recycled story lines about who will control Ewing Oil this season and finally let JR have it.The second weak story line is even dumber than the Emerald Mine story. The Angelica Nero story line - Angelica's husband Dmitri Marinos is either dying or already dead and has apparently written Angelica out of his will. Angelica finds that Jack Ewing is a dead ringer for the ailing Dmitri and plans to have Jack stand in for Dmitri at a masquerade ball on board a yacht in Greece. This will convince the public that Dmitri is still alive and well. Angelica will then forge Dmitri's signature on a new will naming her a sole heir of Dmitri Marinos Shipping. Jack Ewing standing in for Dmitri and cousin JR will be killed during an explosion on the yacht and Angelica will inherit Marinos shipping. However, something goes wrong with her plan. Jack and JR both look just plain ridiculous in the costumes at the ball. Angelica begins to suspect someone in her inner circle has betrayed her. Her assistant, Grace has actually fallen for Jack and warns him and JR that they are in great danger. At the ball when all Hell breaks loose Jack and JR head for hills or more accurately back to Dallas. Angelica gets caught in her own trap when she tries to kill JR. Since this is the dream season we never find out what became of that explosion at Ewing Oil or Jamie's car explosion which was meant for Jack. Strangely enough, of course, or maybe not so strangely the weakest storyline was the return of Bobby in the very last scene when we find out that it was all just a dream.Another noticeable flaw is that we continue to see JR's schemes fail to accopmlish anything. Remember back in the classic Dallas era JR Ewing always covered his tracks and never left any stone unturned. This will eventually turn JR into a loser and more a black sheep, screw up rather than a villain.",5,This Review Was Just A Dream,1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,3558,"['actually', 'liked', 'season', 'little', 'better', 'season', '8', 'Once', 'get', 'episodes', 'Bobby', 'passing', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'drinking', 'fairly', 'enjoyable.The', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'have', 'JR', 'unfairly', 'lashing', 'out', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Dusty', 'everyone', 'else', 'Bobby', 'death', 'bit', 'contrived', 'something', 'ninth', 'season', 'have', 'had', 'suffer', 'JR', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'most', 'recent', 'separation', 'divorce', 'custody', 'battle', 'reconciliation', 'episode', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'having', 'nightmare', 'being', 'chased', 'woods', 'bit', 'much', 'Thankfully', 'finally', 'have', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'drying', 'out', 'least', 'have', 'impression', 'things', 'can', 'go', 'forward', 'different', 'direction', 'recurring', 'conflict', 'JR', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'had', 'become', 'dangerously', 'close', 'self', 'parody.This', 'season', 'did', 'seem', 'offer', 'attempt', 'go', 'forward', 'different', 'direction', 'Bobby', 'death', 'Pam', 'taking', 'place', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'Mark', 'Graison', 'return', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'drying', 'out', 'etc', 'Only', 'few', 'story', 'lines', 'seem', 'kind', 'far', 'fetched', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb.The', 'Emerald', 'mine', 'story', 'seemed', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'Pam', 'being', 'sent', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'last', 'season', 'find', 'Mark', 'Graison', 'who', 'presumed', 'dead', 'will', 'suddenly', 'venture', 'jungles', 'South', 'America', 'what', 'ever', 'reason', 'went', 'there', 'Surprisingly', 'seemed', 'make', 'sense', 'return', 'sell', 'JR', 'shares', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'thus', 'giving', 'JR', 'what', 'always', 'wanted', 'anyway', 'as', 'well', 'Pam', 'ridding', 'herself', 'what', 'seemed', 'feel', 'caused', 'family', 'problems', 'JR', 'always', 'been', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'actually', 'cared', 'company', 'anyway', 'would', 'also', 'end', 'tiresome', 'worn', 'recycled', 'story', 'lines', 'who', 'will', 'control', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'season', 'finally', 'let', 'JR', 'have', 'it.The', 'second', 'weak', 'story', 'line', 'even', 'dumber', 'Emerald', 'Mine', 'story', 'Angelica', 'Nero', 'story', 'line', 'Angelica', 'husband', 'Dmitri', 'Marinos', 'dying', 'already', 'dead', 'apparently', 'written', 'Angelica', 'will', 'Angelica', 'Jack', 'Ewing', 'dead', 'ringer', 'ailing', 'Dmitri', 'plans', 'have', 'Jack', 'stand', 'Dmitri', 'masquerade', 'ball', 'board', 'yacht', 'Greece', 'will', 'convince', 'public', 'Dmitri', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'Angelica', 'will', 'then', 'forge', 'Dmitri', 'signature', 'new', 'will', 'naming', 'sole', 'heir', 'Dmitri', 'Marinos', 'Shipping', 'Jack', 'Ewing', 'standing', 'Dmitri', 'cousin', 'JR', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'explosion', 'yacht', 'Angelica', 'will', 'inherit', 'Marinos', 'shipping', 'However', 'something', 'wrong', 'plan', 'Jack', 'JR', 'look', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'costumes', 'ball', 'Angelica', 'suspect', 'someone', 'inner', 'circle', 'betrayed', 'assistant', 'Grace', 'actually', 'fallen', 'Jack', 'JR', 'are', 'great', 'danger', 'ball', 'when', 'Hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Jack', 'JR', 'head', 'hills', 'more', 'accurately', 'back', 'Dallas', 'Angelica', 'caught', 'own', 'trap', 'when', 'kill', 'JR', 'dream', 'season', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'became', 'explosion', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'Jamie', 'car', 'explosion', 'was', 'meant', 'Jack', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'course', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'strangely', 'weakest', 'storyline', 'was', 'return', 'Bobby', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'dream.Another', 'noticeable', 'flaw', 'continue', 'see', 'JR', 'schemes', 'fail', 'accopmlish', 'anything', 'Remember', 'back', 'classic', 'Dallas', 'era', 'JR', 'Ewing', 'always', 'covered', 'tracks', 'never', 'left', 'stone', 'unturned', 'will', 'eventually', 'turn', 'JR', 'loser', 'more', 'black', 'sheep', 'screw', 'up', 'rather', 'villain']",Dallas: Season 9

Last season with Donna Reed was, to me and others I know, what the real Miss Ellie should be.  She was an attractive older woman who can act, dressed attractively but appropriately, and was just so real.  Barbara Bel Geddes has spent all these prior seasons lumbering about in ugly, colorless sack dresses not worthy of Jock Ewing's wife, staring off into space and seldom looking anyone in the eye as she drones her lines, and every once in a while she drawls ""Jayyyyy  Ahhhhhh,"" to J.R. or referring to him. To see her return in this season nine was the biggest let down for me.  Of course I knew she would be back, I'm old enough to remember watching the entire series on television. But the let down was no less because of that.

The  writing was excellent,and seeing the episodes back to back you can appreciate that the writers were truly telling a long-term story.(compare this to the endless Law and Order and CSI shows that we have now...)DALLAS always had a big budget,and a huge cast- this was the centerpiece of the CBS schedule.  They were in a bit of a war with ABC's DYNASTY, and upped the glitz factor this season.ABC had Nolan Miller, so LORIMAR hired (Bill) TRAVILLA to costume the cast. TRAVILLA had a spectacular career in film, dressing and creating classic looks for many stars.TRAVILLA also was the designer for Knots Landing and Falcon Crest, but clearly saved the best for the DALLAS cast.Some reviewers have been critical of the Marinos storyline, in particular the lovely Barbara Carrera as Angelica Nero.  She was cast as an ultra-vixen, and a seriously smart woman.  She was just as tough (if not more) than JR.As the story goes on, Angelica becomes truly evil, is given a rest for a few episodes, and then comes back for the final few episodes to cause havoc (and eliminate a few guest stars) for the DALLAS cast.This season is a keeper,and will be enjoyed by all-- particularly those who did not see it the 1st time around!You will LOVE this!",5,Dreaming of better times....,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,1370,"['Season', '9', 'DALLAS', 'must', 'have', 'true', 'snapshot', 'early', ""mid-80's.The"", 'storyline', 'great', 'bit', 'top', 'writing', 'was', 'excellent', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'back', 'back', 'can', 'appreciate', 'writers', 'were', 'truly', 'telling', 'long-term', 'story', 'compare', 'endless', 'Law', 'Order', 'CSI', 'have', 'now', 'DALLAS', 'always', 'had', 'big', 'budget', 'huge', 'cast-', 'was', 'centerpiece', 'CBS', 'schedule', 'were', 'bit', 'war', 'ABC', 'DYNASTY', 'upped', 'glitz', 'factor', 'season.ABC', 'had', 'Nolan', 'Miller', 'so', 'LORIMAR', 'hired', 'Bill', 'TRAVILLA', 'costume', 'cast', 'TRAVILLA', 'had', 'spectacular', 'career', 'film', 'dressing', 'creating', 'classic', 'looks', 'many', 'stars.TRAVILLA', 'also', 'was', 'designer', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'clearly', 'saved', 'best', 'DALLAS', 'cast.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'critical', 'Marinos', 'storyline', 'particular', 'lovely', 'Barbara', 'Carrera', 'Angelica', 'Nero', 'was', 'cast', 'ultra-vixen', 'seriously', 'smart', 'woman', 'was', 'just', 'tough', 'not', 'more', 'JR.As', 'story', 'Angelica', 'truly', 'evil', 'given', 'rest', 'few', 'episodes', 'then', 'back', 'final', 'few', 'episodes', 'cause', 'havoc', 'eliminate', 'few', 'guest', 'stars', 'DALLAS', 'cast.This', 'season', 'keeper', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'particularly', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', '1st', 'time', 'around', 'will', 'LOVE']",Dallas: Season 9

The first time I've seen it, I lost interest in DALLAS after the 7th season when it originally aired in the 80s. I've bought every season that has been released on DVD and have been very satisfied with seasons 8 & 9. I just ordered season 10. Season Nine is excellent. Although ""Bobby"" is absent from the dream, the storylines are fresh and exciting. The characters of Ray, Donna and Sue Ellen especially had an interesting year. It's a shame they couldn't pick up where they left off when season 10 begins. I highly recommend watching all of this season. I think the show did just fine without Bobby. After Bobby comes back I'm sure the show really went downhill, from reading some other reviews. Overall this is one of the best seasons of Dallas I've seen. It wasn't a nightmare to watch--I'm looking forward to season 10 just to see exactly lost I am in the characters that I grew to love in season 9.

SueEllen started out a reddish brown and now she is gray or blonde.  JR would flunctuate between gray and black.  The haircuts would change from scene to scene.  Everybody is now extremely wealthy; there are literally no working class people on the show anymore.One odd thing was the tightness of Dack Rambo's pants.  I even looked him up because his pants were so tight and found out he was gay.  It really is obvious on the show because the writers wouldn't even let him kiss or make out with any woman on the show, even though he is the hottest guy on the show.Angelica stands out like a sore thumb; she is some sort of European trying to do business with Ewing oil; she seems like a caricature of a villian or something; like somebody you would see on SCOOBY DOO.Jenna is losing her mind.  Ray and Donna are volunteering with special needs children.  Ms. Ellie is back (THANK GOODNESS) and Sue Ellen is working (THANK GOODNESS).  SueEllen and JR are fighting or reconciling or whatever.  Pam has been kidnapped and returns unaffected.The whole season has been like a puzzle; you basically had to try to put together the storylines yourself.Pros and Cons of this season:PROS:1. SueEllen has a job and has a life outside of JR and Southfork and, as a result, JR has developed a level of respect towards her that wasn't evident in past seasons.2. Donna and Rae are finally building a house that a wealthy couple would live in.  The Donna actress even commented to producers that it made no sense for the KREBBS to be hanging clothes on the line when they are millionaires3. Ellie is back and her grandmother demeanor and clothes is a pleasant contrast to all the glamour and over dressing that takes place on the show4. Cliff actually has a wife with a brain, Jamie.5. JR actually seems to be showing love towards SueEllenCONS:1. Jack- Dack Rambo is hot, but it is clear that he is uncomfortable with the women on the show and uncomfortable with his storyline or lack thereof2. JR became a wuss this season.  Many betrayed him and he did nothing.  SueEllen ends up on skid row and afterwards he decides he can't live without her and leaves his girlfriend for her.  The old JR would have left Mandy, got a new girlfriend, and then pretended to be with SueEllen3. Mark Grayson, Matt, and Pam - I just don't see the point of them being on the show4. Jenna and Charlie - I just didn't see the point of them being on the show5. Ben - this guy doesn't even try to pretend he is not creepy; he is outwardly creepyThe worst part of the show, however, is#6.

1153446,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B0016I0AGY,"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man""","[1, 1]","The title above pretty much sums up the so-called ""dream"" season.  In almost every episode the name of Bobby Ewing,"" formerly played by Patrick Duffy since the show's debut, is mentioned.  It seems that from the start, the producers did not want viewers to forget the character, hoping that the actor associated with the part would change his mind and return to the fold.Even though the events of Season Nine - actually the EIGHTH full season -apparently didn't happen, it is still an entertaining one... well, at least the first half is.It heralds the return of Barbara Bel Geddes as beloved ""Miss Ellie.""  It is obvious that the writers would ecstatic about the actress's return and they saddled her with some delicious dialogue and scenes that demonstrated the character, as well as the actress's, strength and compassion.  Her return is most welcome, bringing a bit of ""normalcy"" to a rather ""abnormal"" season.The ""abnormal"" comes in the form of Barbara Carrera as the mysterious ""Angelica Nero.""  Obviously, trying to emulate ""Dynasty"" with its over-the-top ""Alexis Carrington"" (played with relish by Joan Collins), ""Dallas"" introduces Carrera, an international beauty and actress, as a woman with a plot of deception and murder that involves J.R. (Larry Hagman) and Jack Ewing (Dack Rambo).  During the run of the season, Carrera gets to wear some of the most outlandish - but stylish - clothes in the history of the medium which add to the character's personality.  It's like the writers are saying to the audience that this women deserves to be noticed 'cause - as the season develops - she's not one that needs to be ignored.The season also sees the departure of Martha Scott's recurring role as Sue Ellen's (Linda Gray) mother, Patricia, along with the assumed ""riding-off-into-the-sunset"" departure of female viewer's favorite ""Dusty Farlow,"" played by Jared Martin.  Scott, an actress with a long career in film and television, gets to shine in the episodes ""Mothers"" and ""Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen.""  Martin is there most to provide support for Gray's ""Sue Ellen"" as that character battles - and ultimately conquers - her alcohol demons.Besides Carrera, the season also boasts some ""drop-bys"" by other notable actors.  Oscar winner George Chakiris (""West Side Story""), character actor Raymond St. Jacques, ""S.W.A.T's"" Steve Forrest, and Russell Johnson, forever engrained in TV audiences as ""The Professor"" on ""Gilligan's Island,"" make an appearance or two on the long-running drama.Marc Singer joins the cast as ""Matt Cantrall,"" a friend of Bobby's that concocts a plan the leads Pam (Victoria Principal) to the jungles of South America to find emeralds.  Because Singer's height and build, along with 80's haircut, is similar to fellow castmate John Beck (""Mark Graison""), their scenes together seem almost mirrorlike, with the exception of Beck's trademark mustache.As mentioned earlier, the first half of the season is the best.  The second suffers with the Angelica Nero storyline being dragged out too long and the ""How-crazy-is-she-going-to-get"" one dealing with Jenna Wade, played by Priscilla Presley.But, even with those two elongated plots, the season still shows that there's still life left in the show, even with the ""death"" of Bobby one year earlier.  Even though it's a television drama, the writers manage to interject some responsible commentary on adoption, animal rights, alcohol abuse, and blood donation.'Not bad for a show with ""oil"" in its veins.",4,"The ""Let's-Keep-the-memory-of-Bobby-Ewing-alive-and-hope-that-Patrick-Duffy-comes-back"" season",1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,3485,"['title', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'so-called', 'dream', 'season', 'almost', 'episode', 'name', 'Bobby', 'Ewing', 'formerly', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'show', 'debut', 'mentioned', 'start', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'viewers', 'forget', 'character', 'hoping', 'actor', 'associated', 'part', 'would', 'change', 'mind', 'return', 'fold.Even', 'events', 'Season', 'Nine', 'actually', 'EIGHTH', 'full', 'season', '-apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'still', 'entertaining', 'one', 'well', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'is.It', 'return', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'beloved', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'obvious', 'writers', 'would', 'ecstatic', 'actress', 'return', 'saddled', 'delicious', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'demonstrated', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'actress', 'strength', 'compassion', 'return', 'most', 'welcome', 'bringing', 'bit', 'normalcy', 'rather', 'abnormal', 'season.The', 'abnormal', 'form', 'Barbara', 'Carrera', 'mysterious', 'Angelica', 'Nero', 'Obviously', 'trying', 'emulate', 'Dynasty', 'over-the-top', 'Alexis', 'Carrington', 'played', 'relish', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Dallas', 'introduces', 'Carrera', 'international', 'beauty', 'actress', 'woman', 'plot', 'deception', 'murder', 'J.R.', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'Jack', 'Ewing', 'Dack', 'Rambo', 'run', 'season', 'Carrera', 'wear', 'most', 'outlandish', 'stylish', 'clothes', 'history', 'medium', 'add', 'character', 'personality', 'writers', 'are', 'saying', 'audience', 'women', 'be', 'noticed', ""'cause"", 'season', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'ignored.The', 'season', 'also', 'departure', 'Martha', 'Scott', 'recurring', 'role', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Linda', 'Gray', 'mother', 'Patricia', 'assumed', 'riding-off-into-the-sunset', 'departure', 'female', 'viewer', 'favorite', 'Dusty', 'Farlow', 'played', 'Jared', 'Martin', 'Scott', 'actress', 'long', 'career', 'film', 'television', 'shine', 'episodes', 'Mothers', 'Goodbye', 'Farewell', 'Amen', 'Martin', 'there', 'most', 'provide', 'support', 'Gray', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'character', 'ultimately', 'conquers', 'alcohol', 'demons.Besides', 'Carrera', 'season', 'also', 'drop-bys', 'other', 'notable', 'actors', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'George', 'Chakiris', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'character', 'actor', 'Raymond', 'St.', 'Jacques', 'S.W.A.T', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'Russell', 'Johnson', 'forever', 'engrained', 'TV', 'audiences', 'Professor', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'make', 'appearance', 'two', 'long-running', 'drama.Marc', 'Singer', 'cast', 'Matt', 'Cantrall', 'friend', 'Bobby', 'plan', 'leads', 'Pam', 'Victoria', 'Principal', 'jungles', 'South', 'America', 'find', 'emeralds', 'Singer', 'height', 'build', '80', 'haircut', 'similar', 'fellow', 'castmate', 'John', 'Beck', 'Mark', 'Graison', 'scenes', 'together', 'seem', 'almost', 'mirrorlike', 'exception', 'Beck', 'trademark', 'mustache.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'best', 'second', 'suffers', 'Angelica', 'Nero', 'storyline', 'being', 'dragged', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'How-crazy-is-she-going-to-get', 'one', 'dealing', 'Jenna', 'Wade', 'played', 'Priscilla', 'Presley.But', 'even', 'two', 'elongated', 'plots', 'season', 'still', 'still', 'life', 'left', 'show', 'even', 'death', 'Bobby', 'one', 'year', 'earlier', 'Even', 'television', 'drama', 'writers', 'manage', 'interject', 'responsible', 'commentary', 'adoption', 'animal', 'rights', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'blood', 'donation', 'bad', 'show', 'oil', 'veins']",Dallas: Season 9

See details below:A couple of nights ago the Home Theater Forum presented Warner Brothers Home Video (T.V. and Animation divisions only) for a chat. During the forum, Warner Brothers FINALLY said they are giving KNOTS LANDING another chance by releasing SEASON 2 sometime in 2009. Therefore, in order for this series to have continued success, We, the fans and any other curious viewers, new viewers, etc... need to show support to buy this series. ESPECIALLY THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! THE FIRST WEEK SALES WILL DETERMINE CONTINUED DVD SEASON SETS OF KNOTS LANDING.....Very much like a new movie, when it's released in theaters, the first week opening sales determines if a movie should/could have a sequel. (think in terms of the recent ""Dark Knight"" movie with Heath Ledger) which was a box office hit the first week (and beyond) when it was in theaters this summer. The movie is also coming out with a sequel within the next 2-3 years because of this success.Therefore if you apply those terms to the first week sales of the DVD release of Knots Landing's 2nd season, it will have continued success, like it's sister show DALLAS. Please, I know the economy has not been the greatest (and it seems to be getting worse) and soon most of us will only be able to watch t.v. at home anyway (instead of going to the movies), please save your money and support this wonderful show. PLEASE BUY THIS THE 2ND SEASON THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! If all is successful, Warner Brothers will continue to produce the remaining seasons of this show as well as another show....FALCON CREST.....that's right, all you FALCON CREST fans out there, according to Warner Brothers chat the other night, sales of KNOTS LANDING will also help determine releasing not only more KNOTS LANDING, but FALCON CREST as well.

A turning point in the dallas saga as this season was the first to drop out of nielsen's top 5 since the ""who shot j.r"" season 6 years ago. Dallas was the NO 1 or NO 2 show for 5 years from 81 to 85 but beginning with the ""dream season"" ratings droped due to bobby's departured and to capice's involvement who wanted WRONGLY to make dallas more like a ""dynasty"" series.Next season was the last to include all of the original cast as bell geddes was back from this season and bobby returned in the 1986-1987 season so except for lucy all others were present in dalla's 10nth season but it was already too late because the soap-crazed era was at an end. Dynasty finished the 86-87 season at #24 as all other soaps like falcon crest and knots landind finished in low positions and only dallas managed to finish at #11 which was a triumph for a series 10 years old BUT as i said the damage was already done and at the end of the season victoria principal announced she was leaving due to personal reasons and this was the beginning of the end. Susan howard also left and in the next 11nth season it was the turn of steve kanaly and priscilla presley. In the 12th season linda gray left and when the show reached it's final 14nth season two years later ONLY 3 of the original cast members were still present. patrick duffy, larry hagman and ken kercheval. As i said dallas finished at #11 in it's tenth season, at #22 in it's 11nth season, at #30 in it's 12th season and it's last two seasons were out of the top 40 so it was canselled in 1991.Enjoy this season which was to become a dream and wait for the next season which was the last season of dallas that all original cast were present in the post jim davis era except only for tilton who was to come back in 1988.In my opinion dalla's final demise started after victoria left the show and other cast members followed her as ratings were droping fast because it was the end of the soap-crazed era and because mr.Capice tried to change dallas into something it wasn't but that's another matter.In this season everybody mourns bobby, mark graison is back from the ""dead"" but don't forget that all is pam's dream so we wait the next season to see what really happened after the ""supposed"" bobby's death.Until then enjoy another great DREAM SEASON OF DALLAS.",5,The season which was to become A BEAUTIFUL DREAM is here,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,2386,"['was', 'expected', '9nth', 'season', 'dallas', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'coming', 'summer', 'turning', 'point', 'dallas', 'saga', 'season', 'was', 'first', 'drop', 'nielsen', 'top', '5', 'who', 'shot', 'j.r', 'season', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'Dallas', 'was', 'NO', '1', '2', 'show', '5', 'years', '81', '85', 'beginning', 'dream', 'season', 'ratings', 'droped', 'due', 'bobby', 'departured', 'capice', 'involvement', 'who', 'wanted', 'WRONGLY', 'make', 'dallas', 'more', 'dynasty', 'series.Next', 'season', 'was', 'last', 'include', 'original', 'cast', 'bell', 'geddes', 'was', 'back', 'season', 'bobby', 'returned', '1986-1987', 'season', 'so', 'lucy', 'others', 'were', 'present', 'dalla', '10nth', 'season', 'was', 'already', 'too', 'late', 'soap-crazed', 'era', 'was', 'end', 'Dynasty', 'finished', '86-87', 'season', '24', 'other', 'soaps', 'falcon', 'crest', 'knots', 'landind', 'finished', 'low', 'positions', 'only', 'dallas', 'managed', 'finish', '11', 'was', 'triumph', 'series', '10', 'years', 'old', 'BUT', 'i', 'said', 'damage', 'was', 'already', 'done', 'end', 'season', 'victoria', 'principal', 'announced', 'was', 'leaving', 'due', 'personal', 'reasons', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'Susan', 'howard', 'also', 'left', 'next', '11nth', 'season', 'was', 'turn', 'steve', 'kanaly', 'priscilla', 'presley', '12th', 'season', 'linda', 'gray', 'left', 'when', 'show', 'reached', 'final', '14nth', 'season', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'ONLY', '3', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'still', 'present', 'patrick', 'duffy', 'larry', 'hagman', 'ken', 'kercheval', 'i', 'said', 'dallas', 'finished', '11', 'tenth', 'season', '22', '11nth', 'season', '30', '12th', 'season', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'top', '40', 'was', 'canselled', '1991.Enjoy', 'season', 'was', 'become', 'dream', 'wait', 'next', 'season', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'dallas', 'original', 'cast', 'were', 'present', 'post', 'jim', 'davis', 'era', 'only', 'tilton', 'who', 'was', 'come', 'back', '1988.In', 'opinion', 'dalla', 'final', 'demise', 'started', 'victoria', 'left', 'show', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'followed', 'ratings', 'were', 'droping', 'fast', 'was', 'end', 'soap-crazed', 'era', 'mr.Capice', 'tried', 'change', 'dallas', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'matter.In', 'season', 'everybody', 'bobby', 'mark', 'graison', 'back', 'dead', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'pam', 'dream', 'wait', 'next', 'season', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'supposed', 'bobby', 'death.Until', 'then', 'enjoy', 'great', 'DREAM', 'SEASON', 'OF', 'DALLAS']",Dallas: Season 9
1153453,A3ILFAT3HHYOXE,B0016I0AGY,widowedwalker,"[15, 18]","Fortunately, the real Miss Ellie is back (in the form of Barbara Bel Geddes) but this is an otherwise strange year.With Bobby ostensibly dead, new writer/producers took over the show and attempt to make it both more introspective (like spin-off KNOTS LANDING) but also more glamorous (like rival DYNASTY).The first half of the season almost works--- it's edgier and experimental. But mid-way thru, the plotting just becomes muddled without any direction, and you have characters making nice-nice who never ordinarily would. The scenes become increasingly maudlin, taking on a frankly prissy ""Little-Woman-Fixes-All"" perspective which is riminiscent of the old daytime soaps from prior decades, and it's not an improvement.By year's end (SPOILER ALERT!!) Bobby re-appears in Pam's shower... Back in 1986, this became DALLAS' biggest cliffhanger since J.R. was shot: how is Bobby alive??But it was the answer which became THE biggest ""Jump the Shark"" moment in TV history: Bobby's death and the entire subsequent year was all one long dream on the part of Bobby's ex-wife, Pam.Many long-term viewers tuned-out never came back. The dream scenario became a sitcom punchline for years.Sure, DALLAS was a ""soap"", but also one of the most influential shows in TV history, and fans were appalled by the use of the dream because it wasn't the kind of device the series was accustomed to previously throwing at their audience.Suffice it to say, DALLAS never recovered either its audience or the hard-won respect it had earned up until that time. DALLAS had quite literally become a legend in its own time, and critics had eventually been won over by the show, acknowledging it to be a legitimate drama--- until this, an insulting plot contrivance which wound up validating all the ""it's just a soap"" cliches the series had worked so fervently to overcome prior to that.The use of the dream was the result of petty squabbles between producers, with the fans ultimately left out in the cold. And even to this day, some people close to the show claim that the dream was ""the only way to bring Bobby back"" and that ""the ratings surged up again after the dream scenario was used""....Neither of which was true at all.",3,Weird Year in the Middle of the Series,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,2201,"['Fortunately', 'real', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'back', 'form', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'otherwise', 'strange', 'year.With', 'Bobby', 'ostensibly', 'dead', 'new', 'writer/producers', 'took', 'over', 'show', 'attempt', 'make', 'more', 'introspective', 'spin-off', 'KNOTS', 'LANDING', 'also', 'more', 'glamorous', 'rival', 'DYNASTY', '.The', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'almost', 'edgier', 'experimental', 'mid-way', 'thru', 'plotting', 'just', 'becomes', 'muddled', 'direction', 'have', 'characters', 'making', 'nice-nice', 'who', 'never', 'ordinarily', 'would', 'scenes', 'become', 'increasingly', 'maudlin', 'taking', 'frankly', 'prissy', 'Little-Woman-Fixes-All', 'perspective', 'riminiscent', 'old', 'daytime', 'soaps', 'prior', 'decades', 'not', 'improvement.By', 'year', 'end', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Bobby', 're-appears', 'Pam', 'shower', 'Back', '1986', 'became', 'DALLAS', 'biggest', 'cliffhanger', 'J.R.', 'was', 'shot', 'how', 'Bobby', 'alive', 'was', 'answer', 'became', 'THE', 'biggest', 'Jump', 'Shark', 'moment', 'TV', 'history', 'Bobby', 'death', 'entire', 'subsequent', 'year', 'was', 'one', 'long', 'dream', 'part', 'Bobby', 'ex-wife', 'Pam.Many', 'long-term', 'viewers', 'tuned-out', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'dream', 'scenario', 'became', 'sitcom', 'punchline', 'years.Sure', 'DALLAS', 'was', 'soap', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'shows', 'TV', 'history', 'fans', 'were', 'appalled', 'use', 'dream', 'was', ""n't"", 'kind', 'device', 'series', 'was', 'accustomed', 'previously', 'throwing', 'audience.Suffice', 'say', 'DALLAS', 'never', 'recovered', 'audience', 'hard-won', 'respect', 'had', 'earned', 'up', 'time', 'DALLAS', 'had', 'quite', 'literally', 'become', 'legend', 'own', 'time', 'critics', 'had', 'eventually', 'been', 'won', 'show', 'acknowledging', 'be', 'legitimate', 'drama', 'insulting', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'wound', 'up', 'validating', 'just', 'soap', 'series', 'had', 'worked', 'so', 'fervently', 'overcome', 'prior', 'that.The', 'use', 'dream', 'was', 'result', 'petty', 'squabbles', 'producers', 'fans', 'ultimately', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'even', 'day', 'people', 'close', 'show', 'claim', 'dream', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'bring', 'Bobby', 'back', 'ratings', 'surged', 'up', 'again', 'dream', 'scenario', 'was', 'used', '.Neither', 'was', 'true']",Dallas: Season 9
