756201,AAKGTWGAFT1LQ,B00009PJQJ,A C SHIELDS,"[8, 9]","My only reservation with this program is that I would have liked to have more on the circumstances behind Sam's death .He was very influential as a singer and business person , but he was also a man . That may have been too much for certain people to stomach .The fact that the program features interviews with Sam's family shows that it has been approved - that can also mean that it is a whitewash , sanitised for public consumption .That is a fine line to walk .Just like the Kennedy assassination , one gets the feeling that there is still more to be told . I believe the writer Peter Guralnick is writing a book on Sam and if it is anything like his books on Elvis , it will be compellng reading .A great program and worth watching whether or not you are a fan of this wonderful singer who may have never reached his true potential .",5,About time Sam's fans had this sort of thing to enjoy,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,838,"['only', 'reservation', 'program', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'more', 'circumstances', 'Sam', 'death', '.He', 'was', 'very', 'influential', 'singer', 'business', 'person', 'was', 'also', 'man', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'certain', 'people', 'stomach', '.The', 'fact', 'program', 'interviews', 'Sam', 'family', 'been', 'approved', 'can', 'also', 'mean', 'whitewash', 'sanitised', 'public', 'consumption', '.That', 'fine', 'line', 'walk', '.Just', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'one', 'feeling', 'still', 'more', 'be', 'told', 'believe', 'writer', 'Peter', 'Guralnick', 'writing', 'book', 'Sam', 'anything', 'books', 'Elvis', 'will', 'be', 'compellng', 'reading', '.A', 'great', 'program', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'are', 'fan', 'wonderful', 'singer', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'reached', 'true', 'potential']",N/A

Most all of the major events are somehow covered in over an hour and the choice of music and performances are excellent. Only minor complaint is that complete clips of these songs (particularly the intriguing duet with Jackie Wilson that we only see for a moment) should have been included in the extras (after all, it's the DVD age and the technology makes it possible). But that aside, it's great for both fans and novices of the man who invented soul.",4,"Excellent in every way, but.....",1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,512,"['DVD', 'great', 'job', 'telling', 'Sam', 'Cooke', 'story', 'Most', 'major', 'events', 'are', 'somehow', 'covered', 'hour', 'choice', 'music', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Only', 'minor', 'complaint', 'complete', 'clips', 'songs', 'particularly', 'intriguing', 'duet', 'Jackie', 'Wilson', 'only', 'see', 'moment', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'extras', 'DVD', 'age', 'technology', 'possible', 'aside', 'great', 'fans', 'novices', 'man', 'who', 'invented', 'soul']",N/A
756203,A1C6826T9C18DN,B00009PJQJ,AnotherMusicExpert,"[32, 36]","As overdue, essential & welcome as this DVD documentary is for Sam Cooke fans, let me explain why I give it 3 stars.Nice vintage footage included, and the first time for me to see Sam in action. On the negative side:First, in typical A&E; fashion, the majority of interviewed segments are total fluff...""he had so much charisma, the room would erupt, people went crazy, he was the complete package, I never knew anyone else like him, I knew he had something special"" blah blah blab that you hear in every A&E; biography of a deceased star. We know all that, he was great. There is no negativity whatsoever, yet minimal substance at the same time.Two: length. Get the expanded edition or you're stuck with a quick 1 hour show.Three: total gloss over of his death. Look on the internet for the more in-depth story of the shooting. They skim over this occurance without much dirt on why the married Sam Cooke had a woman back at his room anyway, and why a woman pulled a trigger on such a seemingly otherwise perfect guy.Four: if you are going to license the minimal TV footage of him in existence, it would be nice to not have it talked over, and so brief. I would prefer to see the uncut footage as a DVD extra feature, not 2 hours of repeated story interviews instead. I want to SEE the man perform, not hear about it second hand.Otherwise, a good product in a nutshell, but I feel it is also far from complete or as good as it could have been.",3,"Essential for Cooke fans, but glossed over.",1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,1444,"['overdue', 'essential', 'welcome', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'Sam', 'Cooke', 'fans', 'let', 'explain', 'why', 'give', '3', 'stars.Nice', 'vintage', 'footage', 'included', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'Sam', 'action', 'negative', 'side', 'First', 'typical', 'A', 'E', 'fashion', 'majority', 'interviewed', 'segments', 'are', 'total', 'fluff', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'charisma', 'room', 'would', 'erupt', 'people', 'went', 'crazy', 'was', 'complete', 'package', 'never', 'knew', 'anyone', 'else', 'knew', 'had', 'something', 'special', 'blah', 'blah', 'blab', 'hear', 'A', 'E', 'biography', 'deceased', 'star', 'know', 'was', 'great', 'negativity', 'whatsoever', 'yet', 'minimal', 'substance', 'same', 'time.Two', 'length', 'Get', 'expanded', 'edition', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'quick', '1', 'hour', 'show.Three', 'total', 'gloss', 'death', 'Look', 'internet', 'more', 'in-depth', 'story', 'shooting', 'skim', 'occurance', 'much', 'dirt', 'why', 'married', 'Sam', 'Cooke', 'had', 'woman', 'back', 'room', 'anyway', 'why', 'woman', 'pulled', 'trigger', 'seemingly', 'otherwise', 'perfect', 'guy.Four', 'are', 'going', 'license', 'minimal', 'TV', 'footage', 'existence', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'not', 'have', 'talked', 'so', 'brief', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'uncut', 'footage', 'DVD', 'extra', 'feature', 'not', '2', 'hours', 'repeated', 'story', 'interviews', 'instead', 'want', 'SEE', 'man', 'perform', 'not', 'hear', 'second', 'hand.Otherwise', 'good', 'product', 'nutshell', 'feel', 'also', 'far', 'complete', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Before 2000 even good CD's and LP's were hard to get. But things have changed since the beginning of this century. VH1 had a special about him and that documentary has now been released on DVD.Through interviews with family and friends we get a view of his life from an early age, through the Soul Stirrers and his solo work up to his unfortunate death.We see and hear his brother and sister, Aretha Franklin, Lou Rawls and many more. The docu has been written by Peter Guralnick who has just released a 650 page biography on him in october of 2005.There is also some footage of Sam in action in various tv-shows and that is the best because there really isn't much around. It would have been nice to add those shows in total as a bonus but the 70 minutes of documentary we have now is perfect for people who don't want to be one of the two extensive biographies yet but want to get a good view of what he was like. And he was more than just the interpreter of songs. He wrote them, produced other artists and was an allround business man.Of course his death is being talked about too, but don't expect the final solution for that, that will probably never come.It's the only real documentary on him out there but it's worth buying.",5,Finally some moving pictures!,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,1337,"['someone', 'stature', 'Sam', 'Cooke', 'always', 'surprised', 'how', 'little', 'was', 'there', '2000', 'even', 'good', 'CD', 'LP', 'were', 'hard', 'get', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'beginning', 'century', 'VH1', 'had', 'special', 'documentary', 'now', 'been', 'released', 'DVD.Through', 'interviews', 'family', 'get', 'view', 'life', 'early', 'age', 'Soul', 'Stirrers', 'solo', 'work', 'up', 'unfortunate', 'death.We', 'see', 'hear', 'brother', 'sister', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'Lou', 'Rawls', 'many', 'more', 'docu', 'been', 'written', 'Peter', 'Guralnick', 'who', 'just', 'released', '650', 'page', 'biography', 'october', '2005.There', 'also', 'footage', 'Sam', 'action', 'various', 'tv-shows', 'best', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'add', 'shows', 'total', 'bonus', '70', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'have', 'now', 'perfect', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'one', 'two', 'extensive', 'biographies', 'yet', 'want', 'get', 'good', 'view', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'interpreter', 'songs', 'wrote', 'produced', 'other', 'artists', 'was', 'allround', 'business', 'man.Of', 'course', 'death', 'being', 'talked', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'final', 'solution', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'come.It', 'only', 'real', 'documentary', 'there', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A
