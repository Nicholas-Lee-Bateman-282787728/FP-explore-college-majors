This is a nice work, especially when you consider how hard the filming these scenes are. But the results are amazing.I agree that the main feature could have been longer. I still rate this work 5 stars.",5,What an excitement,1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,338,"['bought', 'Extreme', 'blu-ray', 'see', 'full', 'HD', 'details', 'excitement', 'watching', 'giant', 'wave', 'surfing', 'am', 'fully', 'satisfied', 'nice', 'work', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'hard', 'filming', 'scenes', 'are', 'results', 'are', 'amazing.I', 'main', 'feature', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'still', 'rate', 'work', '5', 'stars']",Ng Extreme

Wowor ""balisurfer""","[1, 2]","When i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing, I was very unhappy with this movie as all the shot of the surfing scene are taken from a helicopter. Its a nice introduction to big wave surfing but nothing compare to riding giants or the billabong odisey. The rock climbing was also so so. The snow board scenes are nice as always but nothing special.Overall this blu ray is good but doesnt show you anything new or that you event seen before.",2,could have had more surfing,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,458,"['When', 'i', 'saw', 'cover', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'exited', 'see', 'big', 'wave', 'surfing', 'was', 'very', 'unhappy', 'movie', 'shot', 'surfing', 'scene', 'are', 'taken', 'helicopter', 'nice', 'introduction', 'big', 'wave', 'surfing', 'nothing', 'compare', 'riding', 'giants', 'billabong', 'odisey', 'rock', 'climbing', 'was', 'also', 'so', 'so', 'snow', 'board', 'scenes', 'are', 'nice', 'always', 'nothing', 'special.Overall', 'blu', 'ray', 'good', 'doesnt', 'show', 'anything', 'new', 'event', 'seen']",Ng Extreme

The climbing scenes are also great.  Totally enjoyed watching this and totally amazed at the size of the waves at Waimea Bay - I think 1999.  Great diversion from the pain as I'm riding my bike on the trainer in front of the TV.Buy it!  You will never regret it.  I think I've shown it at least five times during the first week I had it.,5,"Oh YEA, I'm STOKED!!!!!",1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,455,"['Biggest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'tow-in', 'surfing', 'Laird', 'done', 'various', 'places', 'globe', 'climbing', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'Totally', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'totally', 'amazed', 'size', 'waves', 'Waimea', 'Bay', 'think', '1999', 'Great', 'diversion', 'pain', ""'m"", 'riding', 'bike', 'trainer', 'front', 'TV.Buy', 'will', 'never', 'regret', 'think', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'least', 'five', 'times', 'first', 'week', 'had']",Ng Extreme

This movie was awesome from big wave surfing to windsurfing , it just blew me away . Climbing frozen waterfalls to rock climbing . I can appreciate how dangerous it is for  those men and women athletes on how they challenge mother nature and to be on top of their game because you wont get a second chance if your not.I was interested in how they filmed in Imax and to all camera men/ women and people associated with shooting documentaries, I give five stars",5,iMAX .
