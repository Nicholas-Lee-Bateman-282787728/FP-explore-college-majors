727568,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00007ELFA,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[120, 121]","Written and directed by Sandra Nettelbeck, ""Bella Martha"", strangely translated as ""Mostly Martha"", was her first big feature film, and won international awards and  delighted many...perhaps mostly women, as it is exquisitely romantic. Martina Gedeck as Martha, the master chef who tries to control her world while it collapses around her, is superb. She has an intense kind of beauty and grace, strong but emotionally fragile, and Gadeck's body language speaks volumes, and lets us see into her heart with a simple gesture of the hand, or a flicker in her eyes. This is one of the best performances I've seen in a very long time.Her relationship with her 8 year old niece Lina, so well played by Maxime Foreste, is complex, understandable, and very moving, and the chemistry between Martha and Mario, (Sergio Castellitto is perfect in the part) is fabulous, complete opposites attracting. The supporting cast are all excellent, and director Nettelbeck plays Lina's mother in a touching video sequence.The score by David Darling and Keith Jarrett is marvelous, with delicate sections of Arvo Part's music for one of the most tragic scenes, and includes a bit of Dean Martin's version of ""Volare"", and the irresistible, simply scrumptious ""Via con Me"" by Paolo Conte, a song so happy it would make a bear smile. The cinematography by Michael Bertel is also wonderful, with location shots of Hamburg and Italy, and overflowing vistas of delectable food.I cried, I laughed out loud, and I will always remember this film; it is a small but polished gem.Total running time is 109 minutes.",5,the zest for life and love,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,1583,"['Written', 'directed', 'Sandra', 'Nettelbeck', 'Bella', 'Martha', 'strangely', 'translated', 'Mostly', 'Martha', 'was', 'first', 'big', 'feature', 'film', 'won', 'international', 'awards', 'delighted', 'many', 'perhaps', 'mostly', 'women', 'exquisitely', 'romantic', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'Martha', 'master', 'chef', 'who', 'control', 'world', 'superb', 'intense', 'kind', 'beauty', 'grace', 'strong', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'Gadeck', 'body', 'language', 'volumes', 'see', 'heart', 'simple', 'gesture', 'hand', 'flicker', 'eyes', 'one', 'best', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time.Her', 'relationship', '8', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'Lina', 'so', 'well', 'played', 'Maxime', 'Foreste', 'complex', 'understandable', 'very', 'moving', 'chemistry', 'Martha', 'Mario', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'perfect', 'part', 'fabulous', 'complete', 'opposites', 'attracting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'director', 'Nettelbeck', 'Lina', 'mother', 'touching', 'video', 'sequence.The', 'score', 'David', 'Darling', 'Keith', 'Jarrett', 'marvelous', 'delicate', 'sections', 'Arvo', 'Part', 'music', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'bit', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'version', 'Volare', 'irresistible', 'simply', 'scrumptious', 'Via', 'con', 'Me', 'Paolo', 'Conte', 'song', 'so', 'happy', 'would', 'make', 'bear', 'smile', 'cinematography', 'Michael', 'Bertel', 'also', 'wonderful', 'location', 'shots', 'Hamburg', 'Italy', 'overflowing', 'vistas', 'delectable', 'food.I', 'cried', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'film', 'small', 'polished', 'gem.Total', 'running', 'time', '109', 'minutes']",N/A

Even as a romantic comedy, this gem is top notch. Wonderfully acted, witty, original, at times funny and at times sad and often... yummy! The two main characters are perfect in their role, and you truly end up caring for them.This movie is so good that... Hollywood, who is more and more running short of ideas, has decided to copy... and paste it. The remake now in theaters, for all of us who have seen this movie, will surely be a sad disappointment. Just watch the trailer, and see if Zeta-Jones can play this role, or if Eckart can be as good as Castellitto in this role. I do like both Zeta-Jones and Eckart, but it's just sad sad sad that nowadays Hollywood is reduced to recycle beautiful movies putting the usual good looking actors in places that do not belong to them. Let Zeta-Jones act in Zorro, and let folks who want to see Mostly Martha see Mostly Martha and not its lame remake.My favorite quote from this movie, when Martha point out that there is something wrong with the sugar her shrink has used for a dessert: ""can you really tell which sugar I have used???"" and Martha replies: ""No, but I can tell which one you did NOT use"".

727576,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B00007ELFA,a voice of reason,"[5, 5]","""Mostly Martha"" is well-done comedy/drama in which star Martina Gedeck does an outstanding job of portraying her complex character, Martha. Many reviewers have commented on the food metaphor in the movie, and there is no doubt that the sensual pleasure of food is highlighted here. The romantic-comedy elements are also present in the initial conflicts, growing respect, and eventual relationship between Martha and Mario. However, this movie is far more interesting and complex than the usual romantic comedy.Gedeck does an outstanding job of portraying all of Martha's vulnerabilities, which is what makes both main storylines - her relationship with Mario and her relationship with her niece, Lina - so affecting. Martha is an insecure woman who excels at cooking, and she will not take any risks in life unless she can put her cooking talents to use in the process. We see this in her interactions with her therapist and her new next-door neighbor (who initially seems as though he may become her romantic interest). When Martha's sister is killed in a car accident and Martha takes in her niece, Lina, her only initial attempts at consoling the girl involve trying to get her to eat. Indeed, Martha is what can best be described as an obsessive control freak when it comes to cooking and eating.Having said that, I must emphasize again that Gedeck does such an outstanding acting job that the viewer remains sympathetic to Martha (with perhaps the exception of one scene that involves Lina and school) throughout the film, which is rarely the case between such obsessive characters and viewers. We understand that she fears openness, closeness, and - above all - rejection.The dramatic and comedic elements are nicely interwoven so that the viewer is never overwhelmed by some of sadder aspects of the story but also doesn't forget that the story involves a young girl who has lost her mother. The comedic elements are present throughout the movie, though they are rarely of the laugh-out-loud style (except the scene in which Martha hyperventilates when she sees what a mess Mario is making of her kitchen - it is Martha's neuroses that provide much of the comedy, as well as some of the drama, in the film). The writer(s) and director, Sandra Nettelbeck, provide a model example of how comedy is effectively used to relieve the tension created by dramatic incidents.I highly recommend this film for viewers who enjoy movies that are character-driven rather than action-driven. I also commend the filmmakers for showing restraint and not including the (usually inevitable) sex scene that most such relationship movies have. My personal beliefs still don't agree with the implied sex, but thanks to the filmmakers' better judgment the movie remains a true romantic comedy rather than becoming a sex comedy.",4,A nicely done comedy-drama from Germany,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,2811,"['Mostly', 'Martha', 'well-done', 'comedy/drama', 'star', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'complex', 'character', 'Martha', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'food', 'metaphor', 'movie', 'doubt', 'sensual', 'pleasure', 'food', 'highlighted', 'here', 'romantic-comedy', 'elements', 'are', 'also', 'present', 'initial', 'conflicts', 'growing', 'respect', 'eventual', 'relationship', 'Martha', 'Mario', 'However', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'complex', 'usual', 'romantic', 'comedy.Gedeck', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'Martha', 'vulnerabilities', 'what', 'main', 'storylines', 'relationship', 'Mario', 'relationship', 'niece', 'Lina', 'so', 'affecting', 'Martha', 'insecure', 'woman', 'who', 'cooking', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'risks', 'life', 'can', 'put', 'cooking', 'talents', 'use', 'process', 'see', 'interactions', 'therapist', 'new', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'who', 'initially', 'may', 'become', 'romantic', 'interest', 'When', 'Martha', 'sister', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Martha', 'niece', 'Lina', 'only', 'initial', 'attempts', 'consoling', 'girl', 'involve', 'trying', 'get', 'eat', 'Indeed', 'Martha', 'what', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'obsessive', 'control', 'freak', 'when', 'cooking', 'eating.Having', 'said', 'must', 'emphasize', 'again', 'Gedeck', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'job', 'viewer', 'sympathetic', 'Martha', 'perhaps', 'exception', 'one', 'scene', 'Lina', 'school', 'film', 'rarely', 'case', 'such', 'obsessive', 'characters', 'viewers', 'understand', 'openness', 'closeness', 'rejection.The', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'elements', 'are', 'nicely', 'interwoven', 'so', 'viewer', 'never', 'overwhelmed', 'sadder', 'aspects', 'story', 'also', ""n't"", 'forget', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'mother', 'comedic', 'elements', 'are', 'present', 'movie', 'are', 'rarely', 'laugh-out-loud', 'style', 'scene', 'Martha', 'when', 'what', 'mess', 'Mario', 'making', 'kitchen', 'Martha', 'neuroses', 'provide', 'much', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'drama', 'film', 'writer', 's', 'director', 'Sandra', 'Nettelbeck', 'provide', 'model', 'example', 'how', 'comedy', 'effectively', 'used', 'relieve', 'tension', 'created', 'dramatic', 'incidents.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'are', 'character-driven', 'rather', 'action-driven', 'also', 'commend', 'filmmakers', 'showing', 'restraint', 'not', 'including', 'usually', 'inevitable', 'sex', 'scene', 'most', 'such', 'relationship', 'movies', 'have', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'implied', 'sex', 'thanks', 'filmmakers', 'better', 'judgment', 'movie', 'true', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'rather', 'becoming', 'sex', 'comedy']",N/A

The subtitles are a little sparse, but the action and the cinematography are so functional, efficient and unadorned---thoroughly German in appearance--that this is not really a problem.The protagonist is a beautiful chef, whose relationship to the world and everyone in it she controls through her cooking. Do not go hungry, or your stomach will growl through the movie. When she goes home, she prepares a perfect meal for herself, and suddenly has doubts about eating it alone. She goes downstairs in her apartment building to greet her new neighbor, an attractive bachelor, but cannot bring herself  to invite him to come upstairs to join her; she volunteers to bring him something she has cooked. Through a tragedy, she is forced to begin a more direct relationship with her eight-year-old niece. The demands of the child take Martha away from the restaurant long enough to allow Martha's boss, the owner of the restaurant where Martha works, to hire a soulful Italian as sous chef.The story is not complex, and is starkly told, except for the eruption of sensuality and feeling around the food--at least in the beginning. This movie has one of the all-time great movie scenes involving food and seduction. If you don't go see the movie for any other reason, go see it for that.

Relatively few upright, hyper-neat perfectionists get into cooking because it is inherently messy, unpredictable and sensual. Any food actually cooked by a &quot;Martha&quot; would be tasteless and uninspired. Not mention that relatively few chefs are model-thin and manage to work in a kitchen as clean as a sterile surgical facility and in white clothes without a drop of grease or gravy.I absolutely HATE the corny idea that Germans are, all of 'em, de facto cold and unemotional and Italians are ALL warm, earthy and fun loving sensualists. As someone mentioned, it gets cold in parts of Italy. And I am sure SOME Germans are warm and sensual. Not to mention, why are the women always the cold fish and need some guy to warm them up? It seems to me in real life that the equation is nearly always the other way around.Here is the heart of what I learned from &quot;Mostly Martha&quot;:1. Germany has no family court or children's services.2. No one has a will or any kind of custodial arrangement for an 8 yr old child. Martha does't even know the first name of her nieces father.3. If someone you know dies, you can just show up and take their child home from the hospital. The hospital will have no issues with releasing a minor child -- injured and orphaned -- into your custody.4. If you are the father of said child, you can show up after 8 years without the slightest proof of identity and without having paid a red cent of child support all this time, and yet the child will be released to YOUR custody on the spot and you can then leave the country...without a passport.5. And if you are the aunt of this child, you can drive to Italy and just bring the child back to Germany...again, no court order, no will, no custodial arrangement, no family court, no lawyers, no passport.I could go on and on. Martha doesn't even bother to set up a cot in the living room or get a sofa bed to accomodate her little niece, who doesn't receive one single session with a therapist to deal with the loss of her mom in a horrifying auto accident, while Martha can go WEEKLY, wasting the therapists time with cooking stories and actual meals.I might add that a tempermental chef who argues with customers and throws raw meat at them, wouldn't last long in a nice restaurant no matter how skillfully she could cook.Why 2 stars? The cooking scenes are enjoyable -- the food does look delish -- the child actress is charming and realistic (instead of cloying or cute), and the Italian music is very appealing. It's certainly a clean movie, the love scene played very lightly, and you could watch this with your 8 yr old child or your 99 yr old grandma. But beyond that, it's unrealistic and cliched.

What's impressive here is the directorial restraint--the audience is allowed to decide for themselves what Martha's background might have been to see her into adulthood so detached from people that her entire life has become her career. The kitchen is where Martha lives; it is her dominion. The food she produces (unlike her life) is flawless. Beyond the confines of the restaurant, things are random, uncontrollable; nothing coalesces the way her perfect recipes do.With the arrival of her orphaned niece into her life and a second (Italian) chef at the restaurant, life, in spite of Martha's best efforts, begins to leak in around the edges of her fiercely maintained control--of herself and of her kitchen.

Story centered around Martha, a 30-something, unmarried chef who works at a high end restaurant in Hamburg - and is considered by her boss to be the 2nd best chef in the city (much to Martha's chagrin).  Martha is obsessed with her cooking and is a perfectionist.  She's high strung, compulsive, obsessive and more comfortable with her food and cooking than with people - she is cool and distant with most she interacts with.  She takes criticism about her cooking personally and attacks customers who complain.  Martha comes to care for her 8-year old niece (Lina) - who is suddenly orphaned from her Mother.  Lina grieves and rebels against Martha who struggles to deal with the child.  Lina disrupts the strict regime of Martha's workmanlike life and forces Martha to take stock in what's important in life.  Lina forces an spontaneous, care-free Italian man into Martha's life and sparks fly from her repressed inner self.If you love food and its preparation - all surrounded and wrapped in just-right-music and beautiful cinematography (of the kitchen, of the food, of the restaurant, of Hamburg streets, of her apartment) - this is a soothing, charming, warm all-human film.

This is the best movie I have seen in 2003. It has everything I love in a movie: Love, Drama, superb acting, fabulous and Believable story line, wonderful locations and it is so delicious just like the food in the movie. Only one slight critisicm, no restaurant would have 2 Chefs off work on the same day in the scene where Lina and Mario cooks Italian food in Martha's home kitchen. Set in the Lido restuarant of Hamburg in northern Germany, Martha Klein is a neurotic but wonderful Chef of a boutique restaurant, famous for its great food like foie gras. She has to see a psychiatrist or Therapeut (in German)otherwise her lady boss will fire her. The funny scenes like when she tells the imbecilic customer who complains that her foie gras (goose liver) is raw, that it is ,,perfekt&quot; and cooked at 140 degrees Celsius for 3 minutes is simply hilarious. She then tells him  &quot;go and eat Leberwurst (liver sausage) if you don't know how to eat foie gras!!&quot;. I COULD NOT AGREE MORE! As Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet, I am a Travel, Food and Wine Writer/Consultant and I can tell you that much of the movie is true to live. I am also a Chef and complaints from people who do not know how to appreciate fine gourmet food are legion. Especially so from the nouveau riche. Lots of money but full of bad taste. Moments of great sadness in the movie made me cry like when Martha hears that her single parent sister has gone to heaven in a car accident. She ends up taking care of her 8 year old niece who could do with some psychiatric help too. I don't blame her as her Italian Dad has run off to Italy where he has another wife and kids while her Mum has just died in a car accident, plus she is only 8 years old. The trauma of her Mums's death sends her into a deep depression and she becomes anorexic and refuses to eat. Enter charismatic and somewhat eccentric Mario in the restaurant as her assistant and sparks fly. He cooks with style and finesse to Dean Martin singing &quot;Volare&quot; in Italian which he plays on his own &quot;Ghetteo Blaster&quot;. Martha is shocked and the contrast between the uptight German character of Chef Martha and the coool, extrovert and hang loose Mario is really incredibly and sardonically funny! Mario is a very nice guy although somewhat manipulative and he really helps Lina the little girl to overcome her Anorexia Nervosa and start eating and laughing again. Mario and Martha and Lina eventually form a nice family unit as Mario falls in love with Martha and vice versa. Like an emotional roller coaster, the father of Lina arrives to bring her back to Italy in his lorry. He is a long distance lorry driver with another family in Italy. Mario and Martha are depressed. I cried too. Then Martha decides on her course of action and acts in the best traditions of the SAS who always believe that &quot;Who Dares Wins!&quot; She gives an irate customer with bad taste who complains that her steak is not rare enough a chilled, raw bloody steaky on the table! A Chef's dream come true, Ha! Ha! Then Mario and Martha drive to Italy to bring back Lina, get married and open their own gourmet restuarant. The scene where Lina runs laughing with love and glee right into the outstretched arms of Martha while the warm Italian sun shines is heart wrenching. I cried at the end but they were tears of joy! A fantastic movie and if you understand German and know something about food, you will fall in love with this movie as much as I love Azerbaijan Malossol Caviar and Wieninger Gruner Veltliner Austrian wine.

Martha is the gourmet Chef of the Lido, a spectacularly appointed restaurant somewhere in Germany.  Martha (the beautiful and talented Martina Gedeck) is admired but has great difficulty relating to people on more than a profesional level.  She is in therapy (a sterling portrayal of a therapist by August Zirner) to help her deal with her temper tantrums and find her inner self.  Her ordered world is disrupted first by the Lido's addition of a hilariously warm Italian cook named Mario (Sergio Castellitto) and second by the sudden death of her sister, leaving her in charge of an independent 9 year old niece Lina (fully realized by young actress Maxime Foerste). Lina begins to recover the loss of her mother (and distaste for her guardian aunt) when Mario enters the home with food and tenderness that in the long run is healing for both Martha and Lina.  Director Sandra Nettelbeck stirs these ingredients and the result is a film that touches the funny bone as well as the heart.  The filming is tasty - especialy the kitchen scenes.

I couldn't face watching any more talking heads on TV ""re-analyzing"" that horrible event or debating war with Iraq or whatever might occupy their febrile minds on such a tragic anniversary.Instead I went to the movies.  Even we art house habitues need our escapist entertainment, and I had heard good things about ""Mostly Martha""--a German import about a perfectionist chef in Hannover, whose ordered world is turned upside down by the introduction into her life of her eight-year old orphaned niece...and a warm, life affirming Italian sous-chef who has a life lesson or two of his own to offer.If this sounds like formula, well, it is.  But it works.  The script (in German with good English subtitles) is intelligent, the acting way above average, and the cinematography is impressive.  Martina Gedeck is just about perfect in the title role.  She's a bit reminiscent, in appearance and affect, of the American television actress Kelli Williams (""The Practice"") but with sharper features and a somewhat frostier demeanor.Of course, the hearts of beautiful but frosty heroines in the movies are bound to melt...and with a two-sided assault (adorable kid and irresistable Italian suitor) this particular ice princess doesn't stand a chance.  The old German yen for renewal in sunny Italy--a kind of Sehnsucht that dates back at least to Goethe and his contemporaries--gets played out here as well, with a light touch, of course.I hadn't heard anything of writer/director Sandra Nettelbeck before.

She's hampered by her inability to express herself except thru her cooking. She's so out of step with everyone else that her boss makes her routinely see a therapist (doesn't help). Martha is an accomplished, meticulous chef at Lido's in Hamburg, and, oboy, can she prepare the perfect pigeon (with truffles, natch). But watch her now as her orderly life is jarred by her sister's death and by her suddenly becoming guardian to her troubled 8-year-old niece Lina (Maxime Foerste). So much for her structured, solitary existence.- Nosferatu (1922)- Metropolis (1927)- M (1931)- M&uuml;nchhausen (1943)- Das Boot (1981)- Wings of Desire (1987)- Run Lola Run (1998)It's a list of seven films that looms over this sentence. Those are the seven German pictures I'd seen in my lifetime up to Mostly Martha, which I saw some hours ago. I'm an old dude, so you'd think, in all my decades, I would've caught more of what's in Deutschland cinema. After all, I'm sort of moved on from my mad-on at Germany for, y'know, the world wars. Now I only resent the country for giving us Uwe Boll, David Hasselhoff, and (probably) square dancing. I digress.Mostly Martha (original German title: Bella Martha) is a delectable German dramedy from 2001. It's such a winning movie that it inspired two foreign-language remakes: the Spanish film, Fuera de carta (Chef's Special, 2008), and the Catherine Zeta-Jones starrer,No Reservations(2007). They are neither of them as good as the original.And what makes Mostly Martha so good? Writer/director Sandra Nettelbeck is a self-confessed foodie, so she's well within her wheelhouse. What she gives us is this adroit orchestration of a social misfit's metamorphosis, and this set in the stressful backdrop of haute cuisine. So, yeah, chalk up Mostly Martha as one more welcome entry in the cooking sub-genre inhabited by such notables as:-Waitress (Widescreen Edition)(2007)-Chocolat(2000)-Eat Drink Man Woman(1994)-Tampopo(1985)-Julie & Julia(2009)- andBig Night(1996)Martina Gedeck is exceptional as the very precise, awfully distant Martha. From the start, even thick into her character's isolation, Gedeck invests Martha with likable qualities. There's a poignancy to her habit of stealing moments of privacy in the freezer room so as to settle her frayed nerves after not only time spent rubbing elbows with her staff but also undertaking that most onerous of duties for a head chef - stepping out to speak with the paying customers. Everything changes, of course, when her obstinate niece comes to live with her. And when I say ""obstinate"" maybe I mean ""grieving."" Lina is most likely acting out. Her behavior alarms and mystifies Martha. When Lina continuously rebuffs Martha's proffered meals, Martha is at her wit's end, her means of communication closed off. Sense Martha's wistfulness as she remarks to Lina: ""I wish I had a recipe for you, that I could follow."" Hey, Martha, why don't you try to communicate with words?And there's Martha heeding my advice. That's right, I'm taking credit. Because of me, Martha gradually begins to open up, not only to her niece but as well to that Italian sous-chef (Sergio Castellitto) whose zest for life once nettled her but now is proving to be infectious. So Signore Castellitto is a delight. And the kid, Maxime Foerste, delivers an effortless, natural performance. All three principals exhibit an unforced chemistry. We're treated to a series of sumptuous repasts - a food film has to be on its game to make me salivate over a pigeon on a plate. And since this film implies so much with its employment of the preparation and consumption of food, I wonder what metaphor applies for when you're craving vermin on wings?",5,"""I wish I had a recipe for you, that I could follow.""",1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,3794,"['hard', 'be', 'friends', 'Martha', 'Klein', 'Martha', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'socially', 'awkward', 'guarded', 'hampered', 'inability', 'express', 'thru', 'cooking', 'so', 'step', 'everyone', 'else', 'boss', 'routinely', 'see', 'therapist', ""n't"", 'help', 'Martha', 'accomplished', 'meticulous', 'chef', 'Lido', 'Hamburg', 'oboy', 'can', 'prepare', 'perfect', 'pigeon', 'truffles', 'natch', 'watch', 'now', 'orderly', 'life', 'jarred', 'sister', 'death', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'guardian', 'troubled', '8-year-old', 'niece', 'Lina', 'Maxime', 'Foerste', 'So', 'much', 'structured', 'solitary', 'existence.-', 'Nosferatu', '1922', 'Metropolis', '1927', 'M', '1931', 'M', 'uuml', '1943', 'Das', 'Boot', '1981', 'Wings', 'Desire', '1987', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', '1998', 'list', 'seven', 'films', 'sentence', 'are', 'seven', 'German', 'pictures', ""'d"", 'seen', 'lifetime', 'up', 'Mostly', 'Martha', 'saw', 'hours', 'ago', ""'m"", 'old', 'dude', ""'d"", 'think', 'decades', 'would', ""'ve"", 'caught', 'more', 'what', 'Deutschland', 'cinema', ""'m"", 'sort', 'moved', 'mad-on', 'Germany', ""y'know"", 'world', 'wars', 'Now', 'only', 'resent', 'country', 'giving', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'probably', 'square', 'dancing', 'digress.Mostly', 'Martha', 'original', 'German', 'title', 'Bella', 'Martha', 'delectable', 'German', 'dramedy', '2001', 'such', 'winning', 'movie', 'inspired', 'two', 'foreign-language', 'remakes', 'Spanish', 'film', 'Fuera', 'de', 'carta', 'Chef', 'Special', '2008', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'starrer', 'No', 'Reservations', '2007', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'original.And', 'what', 'Mostly', 'Martha', 'so', 'good', 'Writer/director', 'Sandra', 'Nettelbeck', 'self-confessed', 'foodie', 'well', 'wheelhouse', 'What', 'adroit', 'orchestration', 'social', 'misfit', 'metamorphosis', 'set', 'stressful', 'backdrop', 'haute', 'cuisine', 'So', 'yeah', 'chalk', 'up', 'Mostly', 'Martha', 'one', 'more', 'welcome', 'entry', 'cooking', 'sub-genre', 'inhabited', 'such', 'notables', '-Waitress', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2007', '-Chocolat', '2000', '-Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', '1994', '-Tampopo', '1985', '-Julie', 'Julia', '2009', 'andBig', 'Night', '1996', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'exceptional', 'very', 'precise', 'awfully', 'distant', 'Martha', 'start', 'even', 'thick', 'character', 'isolation', 'Gedeck', 'Martha', 'likable', 'qualities', 'poignancy', 'habit', 'stealing', 'moments', 'privacy', 'freezer', 'room', 'so', 'settle', 'frayed', 'nerves', 'not', 'only', 'time', 'spent', 'rubbing', 'elbows', 'staff', 'also', 'undertaking', 'most', 'onerous', 'duties', 'head', 'chef', 'stepping', 'out', 'speak', 'paying', 'customers', 'Everything', 'changes', 'course', 'when', 'obstinate', 'niece', 'live', 'when', 'say', 'obstinate', 'maybe', 'mean', 'grieving', 'Lina', 'most', 'likely', 'acting', 'out', 'behavior', 'alarms', 'mystifies', 'Martha', 'When', 'Lina', 'continuously', 'Martha', 'proffered', 'meals', 'Martha', 'wit', 'end', 'means', 'communication', 'closed', 'off', 'Sense', 'Martha', 'wistfulness', 'remarks', 'Lina', 'wish', 'had', 'recipe', 'could', 'follow', 'Hey', 'Martha', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'communicate', 'words', 'Martha', 'heeding', 'advice', 'right', ""'m"", 'taking', 'credit', 'Martha', 'gradually', 'open', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'niece', 'as', 'well', 'Italian', 'sous-chef', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'zest', 'life', 'once', 'nettled', 'now', 'proving', 'be', 'infectious', 'So', 'Signore', 'Castellitto', 'delight', 'kid', 'Maxime', 'Foerste', 'effortless', 'natural', 'performance', 'three', 'principals', 'exhibit', 'unforced', 'chemistry', ""'re"", 'treated', 'series', 'sumptuous', 'repasts', 'food', 'film', 'be', 'game', 'make', 'salivate', 'pigeon', 'plate', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'employment', 'preparation', 'consumption', 'food', 'wonder', 'what', 'metaphor', 'applies', 'when', ""'re"", 'craving', 'vermin', 'wings']",N/A

Her reaction to that comment, which she voices to a colleague in the kitchen, is ""second best? Why second best?""  That's Martha (driven, thin-skinned, perfectionist, egocentric) and that's the movie (quick bursts of droll comedy within a quite conventional storyline).  Other good things about the film:  the cinematography is terrific, particularly in the contrast between the often drab or snowy exteriors of the city and the sumptuous shots of food in preparation, displayed, and served; the music is refreshing and off-beat, from Volare to jazz-infused to classical; the energy, spontaneity, and sparks between Martha and her new sous-chef Mario make their reluctant romance both believable and inevitable.  Director Nettlebeck also has a deft, subtle approach to critical plot points.  The death of Martha's sister is played entirely through Martha's reactions (that title again), her face during the telephone call that delivers the news in the noisy peak of rush hour at the restaurant, her wait at the hosptial, and -- then back home after nothing more can be done -- her breakdown as she listens to the answering machine message from her sister saying she and her daughter are running late.  In an equally effective sequence, after weeks of stubborn battles, the  bond between the so similar woman and child is first portrayed through a family video that the two watch consecutively and in silence.  Mostly Martha could stand a little tighter editing to improve its pacing, a sub-plot about Martha's downstairs neighbor simply disappears two-thirds of the way through the film, and -- of course -- there are few surprises in the familiar plot.

But, if the shoe fits ...In this case, Martha is Martha Klein (Martina Gedeck), a supremely talented chef, who lords over the kitchen of the Lido, an upscale Hamburg restaurant. Martha is so obsessed with food preparation and presentation that she'll confront any customer that sends her creations back to the kitchen. Because Martha is &quot;the second best&quot; chef in the city, the Lido's owner, Frida (Sibylle Canonica), refrains from firing Klein, but has demanded that she see a therapist. On the shrink's couch, Martha talks only of recipes. Over his objections, she even prepares meals for him to eat at his desk.Martha's regimented life is disrupted when her sister, a single mother, perishes in an auto accident. Martha is left to care for Lina (Maxine Foerste), her 8-year old niece, while attempting to contact Giuseppe, the girl's father living somewhere in Italy. In the meantime, Frida hires another chef, Mario (Sergio Castellitto), to augment her kitchen staff. Mario's free and easy personality is the antithesis of Martha the Control Freak. Martha finds her life spinning into chaos, especially when it becomes apparent that she's failing miserably as a surrogate Mom to Lina, who remains depressed over her mother's death and so passively hostile that she won't even eat the perfectly prepared and arranged dishes that Martha sets before her.Had MOSTLY MARTHA been made in Tinseltown, it would've inevitably starred Meg Ryan as Martha, Tom Hanks as Mario, and some adorable child star as the incorrigible Lina. The characters of this German production are all eminently likeable and credible, and they concoct a just-right mix of comedy and drama that perhaps wouldn't have been achieved in an American version. While the ending is also eminently predictable, the filmscript, which assigns Martha a (cinematically) unusual profession and places much of the action inside the choreographed frenzy of the Lido's kitchen, is clever enough to elevate the movie, in my opinion, above three stars.I heartily recommend this charmer if you like to cook, frequently eat in high-end restaurants, and/or enjoy films with a cosmopolitan, European ambience.",4,You mean food isn't everything?,1058313600,"07 16, 2003",2003,2202,"['MOSTLY', 'MARTHA', ""n't"", 'about', 'Martha', 'S.', 'shoe', 'fits', 'case', 'Martha', 'Martha', 'Klein', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'supremely', 'talented', 'chef', 'who', 'kitchen', 'Lido', 'upscale', 'Hamburg', 'restaurant', 'Martha', 'so', 'obsessed', 'food', 'preparation', 'presentation', ""'ll"", 'confront', 'customer', 'creations', 'back', 'kitchen', 'Martha', 'quot', 'second', 'best', 'quot', 'chef', 'city', 'Lido', 'owner', 'Frida', 'Sibylle', 'Canonica', 'firing', 'Klein', 'demanded', 'see', 'therapist', 'shrink', 'couch', 'Martha', 'only', 'recipes', 'objections', 'even', 'meals', 'eat', 'desk.Martha', 'regimented', 'life', 'disrupted', 'when', 'sister', 'single', 'mother', 'perishes', 'auto', 'accident', 'Martha', 'left', 'care', 'Lina', 'Maxine', 'Foerste', '8-year', 'old', 'niece', 'attempting', 'contact', 'Giuseppe', 'girl', 'father', 'living', 'somewhere', 'Italy', 'meantime', 'Frida', 'chef', 'Mario', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'augment', 'kitchen', 'staff', 'Mario', 'free', 'easy', 'personality', 'antithesis', 'Martha', 'Control', 'Freak', 'Martha', 'life', 'spinning', 'chaos', 'especially', 'when', 'apparent', 'failing', 'miserably', 'surrogate', 'Mom', 'Lina', 'who', 'depressed', 'mother', 'death', 'so', 'passively', 'hostile', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'eat', 'perfectly', 'prepared', 'arranged', 'dishes', 'Martha', 'her.Had', 'MOSTLY', 'MARTHA', 'been', 'made', 'Tinseltown', 'would', ""'ve"", 'inevitably', 'starred', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Martha', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Mario', 'adorable', 'child', 'star', 'incorrigible', 'Lina', 'characters', 'German', 'production', 'are', 'eminently', 'likeable', 'credible', 'concoct', 'just-right', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'perhaps', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'American', 'version', 'ending', 'also', 'eminently', 'predictable', 'filmscript', 'Martha', 'cinematically', 'unusual', 'profession', 'places', 'much', 'action', 'choreographed', 'frenzy', 'Lido', 'kitchen', 'clever', 'enough', 'elevate', 'movie', 'opinion', 'three', 'stars.I', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'charmer', 'like', 'cook', 'frequently', 'eat', 'high-end', 'restaurants', 'and/or', 'enjoy', 'films', 'cosmopolitan', 'European', 'ambience']",N/A

What you will notice is that this is a movie that is so captivating, so wonderful, that you never want it to end!  It is something to be viewed again and again.The lovely Martina Gedeck plays the title character, 'Martha' Klein, who is a chef extraordinaire.  Not only is she a perfectionist but also a little obsessive compulsive.  She is sent to a therapist by her boss, Frida and has no idea why.  Martha is so uptight that she can't even join in the camaraderie of her fellow restaurant workers every afternoon as they eat and banter before the restaurant opens.  She has no room in her life for fun or for relationships; her only pleasure is cooking~~she doesn't even spend much time eating.  She continually exasperates Frida by daring to confront diners who send back their meals because they feel it is overdone or tough.All this changes when her sister dies and her 8-year-old niece Lina comes to live with her.  To upset the apple cart even more, an eccentric Italian chef, Mario (Sergio Castellitto) is hired to help out in the restaurant.  Both of these characters provide excellent catalysts; they add tremendous drama to Martha's ordered life and she almost has a breakdown from the pressure.  Mario is emotional, happy and loving and he helps turn Martha's life around.  And as for Lina, this adorable little girl shows Martha that she can love and care for someone.

Like ""Eat Drink"", all of the scenes in Mostly Martha are sensual or sensitive.The scenes involving kitchen prep and the food preparation reflect the sensuality of food and the intimacy of a team working together in dance-like unison to turnout standout dishes; the freezer-retreat scenes reflect Martha's basic humanness and the need to check in with herself and her intensity; and the interactions between Martha and her niece quietly remind us that no one can expect everything to come naturally and in controllable form: you can be a great chef and that may be instinctual, but other things, including becoming a parent or parent figure, well, they require a certain open-mindedness and willingness to get outside of oneself, all of which Martha manages to do.

Well, I hope to convince you that it might be better to check out the movie that it was based on.  I know that alot of people find subtitled films to be quite laborious.  But, you will find that the plot of this German film moves quite nicely without requiring too much attention to the dialogue.  In other films, if the movie moves too slowly, then you can forget about following the subtitles.  The acting is superb as most foreign produced films go.  Alot of the expressions go beyond the strict dialogue between actors.  You really feel the pressure and conflict in their thoughts by their interactions with others in the kitchen and at home.  By the end of the movie, you really want to find out more.  I love how sometimes these foreign films leave the ending a little open-ended so that you can image how it ends up.The DVD doesn't have too many frills but that's okay.  The only frill is the original trailer of the movie.  The subtitles are fine except there was a glitch in the middle where there were no subtitles.

I wouldn't hesitate should this be an Italian movie but a German movie about food, I definitely would have to reconsider.  Anyhow, when the movie started, the ambiance was cold and starck.  The location was cold and grey Germany.  Martha hid herself in the cold fridge for moments of peace and quiet when the kitchen was becoming too much to handle.  She loves her food, she knows she's good at it, she wouldn't be held ransom by her patrons, she manages her kitchen with clean precision.  Her profession is everything to her.  That's what makes her feel whole and that she can exert control.  When she has her day off, she eats by herself in her bare apartment and she has got no life whatsoever.  Her life is turned upside down when unforseen circumstance caused the death of her sister and she needs to look after her niece until the latter father can be found.  Furthermore, another Italian chef is added to the kitchen team.  He's exactly opposite of what Martha represents.  Whilst Martha conceals everything inside herself, Mario let everything out and he enjoys his cooking as much as he enjoys his life.  Martha's niece and the restaurant crew is simply enamoured by Mario's charm and joie de vivre.  As any feel good movie would have it, Martha the ice queen is slowly melting and her persona starts to shine through.  She gets to reveal her weaker sides and allows Mario to assist her and work along with her.  Slowly, her strenous relationship is improving with Lili, her niece as well.  The movie ends appropriately in Italy with the colour of landscape changes to a vivid earthy colour, good times that are shared with family and friends over fine wine and food.  A sumptuous movie that spreads over one hour forty minutes but thumb up for the Director for never rushing the movie but telling it as it is.  There are two sub themes here, such as the architect neighbour next floor down from Martha.  There is perhaps, a romantic interest between two or them, or that the architect is to be acting as comic interest but his character simply fades out in the end.  There's also supposed to be comic moment between Martha and the psychiatrist and the light hearted moment can be seen as deliberate and again, in the end, it doesn't add much to the overall flow of the film.  Other than these two issues, the movie is a worthwhile movie to watch.  No extras in the DVD.

727642,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00007ELFA,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[63, 69]","""Food is a great passion of mine, and I think it is one of the best visual and most sensual metaphors life has to offer."" ~Sandra Nettelbeck, German DirectorMartha (Marina Gedeck) is a sexy chef living her life in a very organized fashion. She is single, doesn't have any children and seems to have found the perfect job. As a chef, she takes great pride in her creations and is even willing to confront customers who question her cooking skills, especially if they involve a discussion of how Duck Foie Gras should be cooked. As a perfectionist, she refuses to accept that anything could be wrong with her world, her gourmet cooking or her opinions on food preparation.What Martha is really lacking is an ability to open up her heart and allow love to flow to those around her. She has a passion for cooking, but not for life. While she seems to take pleasure in her cooking, she doesn't seem to have a sense of humor about her world. Restaurant manager, Frida (Sibylle Canonica), insists that she go to therapy and yet, she rarely deals with her inner world, she is more concerned about recipes. She leaves her therapist (August Zirner) rather confused as he can't figure out why she is in therapy. Even when her sister is in an accident, she deals with the pain by thinking about a Lobster's death.When an accident leaves her eight-year-old niece, Lina (Maxine Foerste), in need of care, Martha's heart starts to open to the world. Together Lina and Martha take a journey to healing that is not without conflict. Martha not only accepts Lina into her home, she also vows to find Lina's father. I like the way the director doesn't spoon feed the audience, there are often items you don't fully understand until much later in the movie.Taking on these new responsibilities and dealing with her own sense of loss leaves Martha unable to work for a short period of time. During this time, the restaurant manager hires an eccentric Italian chef. Mario (Sergio Castellitto) is just perfect in this role and introduces a conflict Martha is not equipped to deal with on any level. I loved his sense of humor, the way he played Italian songs in the kitchen and how he inspired frivolity and a joy for life in everyone around him.While Marina Gedeck adds a sexy beauty to this movie, Sergio Castellitto adds warmth and romance. Martha really becomes like a little piece of chocolate melting in his mouth. If you can imagine how frosty she is at first and then how Mario makes her feel when he finally kisses her.Some of Martha's facial expressions had me laughing because she is so serious amidst the utter comedy of various situations. I think I could relate to her near ""panic attack"" when she saw what happened to her own kitchen when Mario comes over to make dinner. That is my favorite scene besides the amazing kissing scene and the picnic scene. There is so much to love in this movie!""Mostly Martha"" is one of those unforgettable ""foodie"" movies you could watch three times in a row because it makes your world feel sane, calm and comforting. It was shot on locations in and around Hamburg, Germany and in some beautiful locations in Italy. The soundtrack takes this story to new levels and there is an element of intimacy that runs through the entire movie.

727643,A1HFRNJMWCKXDP,B00007ELFA,"Robert E. Murena Jr. ""tedmurena""","[7, 7]","To say that Mostly Martha is a movie about food is limiting it to something less than what it really is.  It is a beautiful movie about what it means to happy in life (Its more than just a dream job).  The movie is relevant to cooks and non-cooks alike and is a good date movie for the romanitics out there.This movie uses food as metaphor on several levels to express how each character sees love.  Martha (Martina Gedneck) believes that if you present something (a dish) well with your heart in it, the people receiving it naturally should love it regardless. If the person doesnt love it she is naturally hurt.  Lina (Maxime Foerste, she's great!) believes that since the death of her mother she can't love, thus she can't eat.  Lastly Mario, the fantastic Itallian Chef, believes food and love are a part of a good life.  He exudes this principle and gets on with everyone especially well except for Martha.  See the movie and find out how all of this works out..This movie is really beautiful.  If you are worried that the movie is going to be some iconoclastic german work that is going to require a lot of reading,  fear not.  It is great for all audiences.  Reading subtitles isnt bad and if you are learning german the language is easy to understand.

Any food actually cooked by a ""Martha"" would be tasteless and uninspired. Not mention that relatively few chefs are model-thin and manage to work in a kitchen as clean as a sterile surgical facility and in white clothes without a drop of grease or gravy.""Ha!  Obviously this person has never worked for a German chef.  I have, and Martha's methods are typical of the chefs of her country, and for all their meticulousness and ""sterility,"" not one ever produced tasteless food (being neat and precise has no bearing on the quality of the food one produces; one's palate, skill and inventiveness do, however).  But this is beside the point -- ""Mostly Martha"" is a terrific film on many levels, not in the least because it is a totally realistic depiction of the life of a female executive chef in ANY country.  I burst out laughing as I watched Martha hide in the walk-in to cry or fume (I've done this myself many times), and the restaurant ""family meal"" scenes have all the coziness and familiarity of real restaurant staff meals.  The plot of the movie itself could have been dreadfully treacly and sentimental (as it would have been in American hands), but instead it is affecting, romantic and honest.  As such, I'd rate ""Mostly Martha"" up there with ""Babette's Feast"" and ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,"" the two greatest food films ever made (interesting that none of these are American, isn't it?

I also loved the tempting looking foods presented in this film and the great respect with which they are created. There is something very refined and exquisite about this film and about the treatment of cooking as any other form of art (including tolerance to the nature of its artists). Although the heroine, Martha seems at first like a ""cold fish"", she is moving and touching with her vulnerability and towards the end you find yourself weeping without restraint.In the beginning of the movie Martha is not really a person you can easily relate to . She is very precise, very clean and orderly. I love the parts where Martha is getting prepared for work in the kitchen, she stands still and then shakes the clean white apron and ties it around her - this act is pictured as a ceremony preparing Martha physically and mentally to what she is about to do - her art work. Indeed Martha is considered a magician with foods. However, outside the kitchen it seems that Martha is not a person that moves at ease with the world around her. When her work is interrupted by human things or upset by a client (daring to return food to the kitchen), Martha has a hard time dealing with it and has to run to the large fridge to literally cool down.Martha's clean sterile world is shattered when her sister dies and she needs to take care of her niece Lina. She does her best but finds it hard to relate to the young girl. Both of them are determined to find the child's father who lives in Italy. During this time of upheaval in Martha's life another chef is introduced to the kitchen to fill out for Martha. This is an Italian guy, talkative and warm, not very orderly and not very sterile (likes eating with his hands) who upsets Martha's life in the kitchen as well (""a mad person in my kitchen""? she asks the restaurant owner... ""He's Italian""... is the answer). The kitchen is a place of harmony and control in Martha's world and now she feels her harmony is broken (""two chefs in one kitchen is like two drivers behind the wheel"" Martha tells her psychologist) . The Italian chef seems to ""see"" inside Martha from the start and is not taken aback by her cold behaviour. Martha has no other way but to slowly surrender to the Italian charm.Martha's relationship with Lina develops slowly throughout the movie and although the end is inevitable they succeed in moving the viewers to tears with the restrained gestures and dynamics between them.Martha's tremendous efforts to control her &quot;inner self&quot; in order to become a good care taker for Lina, and her attraction to the Italian chef who is so opposite from her are endearing.",5,A touching delicious film who treats food as art,1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,2795,"['loved', 'everything', 'movie', 'story', 'great', 'music', 'actors', 'especially', 'Italian', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'whom', 'can', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'also', 'loved', 'tempting', 'looking', 'foods', 'presented', 'film', 'great', 'respect', 'are', 'created', 'something', 'very', 'refined', 'exquisite', 'film', 'treatment', 'cooking', 'other', 'form', 'art', 'including', 'tolerance', 'nature', 'artists', 'heroine', 'Martha', 'first', 'cold', 'fish', 'moving', 'touching', 'vulnerability', 'end', 'find', 'weeping', 'restraint.In', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Martha', 'not', 'really', 'person', 'can', 'easily', 'relate', 'very', 'precise', 'very', 'clean', 'orderly', 'love', 'parts', 'where', 'Martha', 'getting', 'prepared', 'work', 'kitchen', 'still', 'then', 'clean', 'white', 'apron', 'act', 'pictured', 'ceremony', 'preparing', 'Martha', 'physically', 'mentally', 'what', 'do', 'art', 'work', 'Indeed', 'Martha', 'considered', 'magician', 'foods', 'However', 'kitchen', 'Martha', 'not', 'person', 'ease', 'world', 'When', 'work', 'interrupted', 'human', 'things', 'upset', 'client', 'daring', 'return', 'food', 'kitchen', 'Martha', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'run', 'large', 'fridge', 'literally', 'cool', 'down.Martha', 'clean', 'sterile', 'world', 'shattered', 'when', 'sister', 'dies', 'take', 'care', 'niece', 'Lina', 'best', 'hard', 'relate', 'young', 'girl', 'are', 'determined', 'find', 'child', 'father', 'who', 'Italy', 'time', 'upheaval', 'Martha', 'life', 'chef', 'introduced', 'kitchen', 'fill', 'out', 'Martha', 'Italian', 'guy', 'talkative', 'warm', 'not', 'very', 'orderly', 'not', 'very', 'sterile', 'likes', 'eating', 'hands', 'who', 'Martha', 'life', 'kitchen', 'as', 'well', 'mad', 'person', 'kitchen', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Italian', 'answer', 'kitchen', 'place', 'harmony', 'control', 'Martha', 'world', 'now', 'harmony', 'broken', 'two', 'chefs', 'one', 'kitchen', 'two', 'drivers', 'wheel', 'Martha', 'psychologist', 'Italian', 'chef', 'see', 'Martha', 'start', 'not', 'taken', 'aback', 'cold', 'behaviour', 'Martha', 'other', 'way', 'slowly', 'surrender', 'Italian', 'charm.Martha', 'relationship', 'Lina', 'slowly', 'movie', 'end', 'inevitable', 'succeed', 'moving', 'viewers', 'tears', 'restrained', 'gestures', 'dynamics', 'them.Martha', 'tremendous', 'efforts', 'control', 'quot', 'quot', 'order', 'become', 'good', 'care', 'taker', 'Lina', 'attraction', 'Italian', 'chef', 'who', 'so', 'opposite', 'are', 'endearing']",N/A

Though ""Martha"" is as predictable as any light-weight romantic drama in Hollywood, and you will not see red-haired Lola running wildly on the streets of Berlin, you will still be enchanted by the film as well.Martha is, according to her employer's words, ""the second best"" chef in Hamburg, Germany; she carefully prepares every details in ""her"" kitchen.  She always cooks her food perfectly, and she is proud of that.  But perhaps too careful because when she goes to the therapist, all she talks about is about cuisines.Then an orphaned girl Lina, daughter of her sister, lands at her door, but because of the recent shock she received, Lina closes her heart, refusing to eat anything.  Moreover, another uninvited person barges into her life: an Italian chef Mario, who is newly hired in ""her"" kitchen, and he likes to sing along with a tape of Dean Martin song.Does Martha come to like them? understanding that there's another way of life?  You know the answer for sure.  But the predictable plot does not mean that ""Mostly Martha"" is mostly uninteresting.  Not at all.  Martha's complex relations with Lina is a credible one, and Martina Gedeck's fine performance as her greatly helps.  You may say that the images of Italian male Mario is not surprising at all -- fun-loving and outgoing -- rather clithe; but Sergio Castellitto, a famous Italian actor (in ""The Great Pumpkin"" and ""The Star Maker"") is engaging enough for us to sustain our interest in those characters.  Ultimately, the film is about this person Martha, and as far as that goes, the film is excellent.The contrast between cold Germany and warm Italy is no news (and actually, the northern part of Italy is very cold in winter).  However, just like the film's quirky music, the borderline gradually melts away, and you will find a very warm place in this German city, and Martha's heart.

Marshall,"[4, 4]","For lovers of foreign films this German creation is wonderful and a true gift for the senses.I found this film to be well written despite the simplicity of the storyline. Martha (Martina Gedeck) is a head chef at a prestigious restaurant, her life is a mess but her culinary creations something to be celebrated. Her world is turned upside down when her sister is accidentally killed and Martha is left to care for her sister's daughter (Maxime Foerste). As she struggles to adapt to a new life and schedule that involves a depressed and independent niece, the restaurant she works for makes a few changes of its own and hires another chef (Sergio Castellitto) who adds a bit of Italian charm to the picture. All of the actors are superb but the food really makes an award winning presentation of its own.This foreign film is so beautiful and appeals to every sense imaginable that I guarantee you will be up and cooking yourself a great meal after watching this one. With almost every scene filmed around a plate of elegant food your taste buds will water and your stomach will stir. Somehow you can even smell the basil, sage and pungent sauces brewing in the background. Alongside the extraordinary cooking is a joyous soundtrack of uplifting music to cater to your ears.

Then, a suddenly-orphaned and very distraught niece appears in Martha's life. A driven, successful professional is not necessarily a successful mother figure, as Lina and Martha both discover. Then, while Martha takes time to get her new, child-inhabited life together, another chef arrives in her kitchen. Mario is easy going, perpetually late, bit of a slob at times, and generally the Oscar to her Felix.Since they must get along professionally, Mario moves in somewhat on Martha's turf. And, much to Martha's dismay, he moves in on Lina's affections, too. Oh, he never meant to, it's just that his cheery style gets through Lina's grief in ways that Martha never could, and his totally innocent approach might be what galls Martha most.By turns funny, serious, sad, and heart-warming, this works its way comfortably to the ending you pretty much expect.
