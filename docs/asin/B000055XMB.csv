567247,A62OMGKSVPZZU,B000055XMB,"Andrew R. Oerman ""Andy Oerman""","[12, 13]","Teenage Monster is not a good movie. I bought it as an Anne Gwynne fan, hoping for a few campy midnight-movie chills. However, this movie is dull, and almost sad in its ineptitude. Where other movies can triumph despite limitations, this one's script is too poor, and not ambitious enough to be entertaining.The liner notes explain many of the movie's problems; there were reasons why some talented people cranked out a movie this cruddy.  One of its few virtues is good acting by Gwynne (even though she hatedhatedhated the film) as the Monster's mother and Gloria Castillo as the manipulative vixen who brings about the Monster's ultimate demise.The Monster is unscary, played by a 50-year old man in boots to make him seem taller. And nearly all of his dialogue was re-dubbed as grunts and hoots to make him seem more like a bestial killer than a thinking being. This would be okay, except for the fact that sometimes he CAN talk reasonably well, just because the script needs him to convey a point. I could buy the dubious idea that the women close to him understood his gibberish, but the inconsistency grated on me.Added to these glaring inconsistencies are the movie's stagnant direction and lack of creepy atmospherics. The sum total is kind of a bore.A side note- It is called Meteor Monster almost everywhere on the web, but goes by its alternate title of Teenage Monster on the cover. This is somehow strangely fitting, as many of the people involved with this movie probably hope it stays hidden.The DVD transfer is excellent. Trailers include Teenagers From Space, Robot Monster, Carnival of Souls, Giant From the Unknown, and Cosmic Man. They are the best part of the disc.",2,Faint praise.

She normally ended up playing romantic leads in B-movies - often a weak person, but with a feisty streak in her that made her too hot to handle for her insipid male co-stars. Made later on in her career, TEENAGE MONSTER has very little to recommend it, except as a poor imitation of I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN.

567250,A2V6CA5GOPFSGI,B000055XMB,Old and in the way,"[0, 0]","This monster actually scared me when I was a kid. A few years later, when I was in my early teens, I sat down with some friends, to watch it, having told them it was really scary. They laughed at the kid's 4th of July ""sparkler"" that was supposed to pass as a flaming meteor and I was SO embarrassed. The hairy monster evoked more laughs. But, no one pointed out, or maybe even realized, how boring this ridiculous sci-fi western was. ""Teenage Monster,"" or ""Meteor Monster,"" as it was titled when it came on TV in the 60's and early 70's in L.A., doesn't seem bad out of incompetence, but rather because the producers wanted it made for a buck fifty. It's kind of a joke on the public, and I suspect that the only people involved in this movie who even try, are those not in on the joke. So, this is just another look back at my youth, via a very crummy old movie.As I recall, the sound and picture on this dvd are excellent and far better than crap like this requires. I also think the only extra is the trailer.If you're curious, just don't pay a penny more than you're comfortable shelling out for a really bad old movie, and you shouldn't be too disappointed.",2,"Appropriate Title, Bad Old Sci-Fi",1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,1163,"['monster', 'actually', 'scared', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'was', 'early', 'teens', 'sat', 'down', 'friends', 'watch', 'having', 'told', 'was', 'really', 'scary', 'laughed', 'kid', '4th', 'July', 'sparkler', 'was', 'supposed', 'pass', 'flaming', 'meteor', 'was', 'SO', 'embarrassed', 'hairy', 'monster', 'evoked', 'more', 'laughs', 'one', 'pointed', 'out', 'maybe', 'even', 'realized', 'how', 'boring', 'ridiculous', 'sci-fi', 'western', 'was', 'Teenage', 'Monster', 'Meteor', 'Monster', 'was', 'titled', 'when', 'came', 'TV', '60', 'early', '70', 'L.A.', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad', 'incompetence', 'rather', 'producers', 'wanted', 'made', 'buck', 'fifty', 'kind', 'joke', 'public', 'suspect', 'only', 'people', 'involved', 'movie', 'who', 'even', 'try', 'are', 'not', 'joke', 'So', 'just', 'look', 'back', 'youth', 'very', 'crummy', 'old', 'movie.As', 'recall', 'sound', 'picture', 'dvd', 'are', 'excellent', 'far', 'better', 'crap', 'also', 'think', 'only', 'extra', 'trailer.If', ""'re"", 'curious', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'penny', 'more', ""'re"", 'comfortable', 'shelling', 'out', 'really', 'bad', 'old', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'disappointed']",N/A

It's unique in the way that it's the only science fiction film that blends elements of a western in with it.  It's also unique in the way a ""teenage monster"" is presented.I give this movie 3 stars because at 10 bucks I feel it was worth every penny.  I bought this about 3 months ago after reading a review for it on here and felt 10 bucks is worth a shot, and it was a shot well taken! Ive watched it about 4 times. It's quick and gets to the point.  The acting in it is actually not bad and very watchable and also comes off more like a stage play rather than a film.  I don't want to give away too much but if you watch it, who really is the villian?
