After failing twice, he tries to devote more time studying, and ends up managing Hinata House, a dormitory for girls, while the owner, his grandmother, takes a long leave of absence.Lots of crazy hijinks occur from the various women, who either want to beat him up, or try and hook him up with one of the other girls. And as they live together, they begin to slowly but surely appreciate Keitaro's efforts, hopeless as they may be at times, and he may or may not have found the girl from his childhood.Overall I enjoyed this romantic, harem comedy. Knocked a star off because it doesn't have the other videos, such as the Christmas or Spring special, nor the OVA's, but the original series with almost 10 hours of entertainment (25 episodes) isn't a bad deal at this price.",4,Nice harem anime,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,995,"['show', 'guy', 'named', 'Keitaro', 'Urashima', 'who', 'trying', 'really', 'hard', 'get', 'Tokyo', 'University', 'vague', 'promise', 'girl', 'when', 'were', 'little', 'kids', 'would', 'meet', 'there', 'again', 'marry', 'other', 'failing', 'twice', 'devote', 'more', 'time', 'studying', 'up', 'managing', 'Hinata', 'House', 'dormitory', 'girls', 'owner', 'grandmother', 'long', 'leave', 'absence.Lots', 'crazy', 'hijinks', 'occur', 'various', 'women', 'who', 'want', 'beat', 'up', 'try', 'hook', 'up', 'one', 'other', 'girls', 'live', 'together', 'begin', 'slowly', 'surely', 'appreciate', 'Keitaro', 'efforts', 'hopeless', 'may', 'be', 'times', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'found', 'girl', 'childhood.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'romantic', 'harem', 'comedy', 'Knocked', 'star', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'videos', 'such', 'Christmas', 'Spring', 'special', 'OVA', 'original', 'series', 'almost', '10', 'hours', 'entertainment', '25', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'bad', 'deal', 'price']",Love Hina: Complete Series

Ken Akamatsu told an interesting story with interesting characters, a great sense of humor, great art, and a whole lot of heart.  The anime had to without a doubt be changed some from the manga, removing alot of the fan service for broadcast, and changing things some to fit into a half hour tv show every week.  Unfortunately in doing so, some of the humor, some of the story, and some of the heart of the manga was lost.  This was inevitable.  Thankfully much of the humor, story and heart survived.  Could it have been done better?  Sure.  Is it worth watching anyway?  Definitely.Other reviews cover the plot well, I will leave that to them.  The story is fun, the characters are awesome, the humor works very well at times.  The characters putting on the play ""Journey to the West"" for a bunch of kids was pure awesome.My one really big complaint is with the English dub version(the discs contain both English and Japanese audio), with Wendee Lee attempting to do an Indian accent that is just painful to hear and caused me to watch in Japanese to avoid her voice(and I usually do like her voice and think she is great).",4,"Better than most, not as good as it should be",1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,1185,"['Love', 'Hina', 'based', 'one', 'better', 'harem', 'mangas', 'ever', 'Ken', 'Akamatsu', 'told', 'interesting', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'great', 'art', 'whole', 'lot', 'heart', 'anime', 'had', 'doubt', 'be', 'changed', 'manga', 'removing', 'alot', 'fan', 'service', 'broadcast', 'changing', 'things', 'fit', 'half', 'hour', 'tv', 'show', 'week', 'Unfortunately', 'doing', 'so', 'humor', 'story', 'heart', 'manga', 'was', 'lost', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Thankfully', 'much', 'humor', 'story', 'heart', 'survived', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'Sure', 'worth', 'watching', 'anyway', 'Definitely.Other', 'cover', 'plot', 'well', 'will', 'leave', 'story', 'fun', 'characters', 'are', 'awesome', 'humor', 'very', 'well', 'times', 'characters', 'putting', 'play', 'Journey', 'West', 'bunch', 'kids', 'was', 'pure', 'one', 'really', 'big', 'complaint', 'English', 'dub', 'version', 'discs', 'contain', 'English', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'Wendee', 'Lee', 'attempting', 'do', 'Indian', 'accent', 'just', 'painful', 'hear', 'caused', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'avoid', 'voice', 'usually', 'do', 'voice', 'think', 'great']",Love Hina: Complete Series

1216399,A30YX90TG1USSR,B001M6SHD8,G. P. Hawkins,"[0, 0]","I've always thought anime best at delivering two types of story: The battle of goodsorcerers vs. evil (Soul Eater and Fairy Tail spring to mind); and comedy/romance stories,especially if they include a touch of the magical or supernatural (Girls Bravo, Shuffle).As a representative of this second type, I had high hopes for Love Hina, but the series fellwell short of expectations.While often funny, and sometimes touching, the episodes were almost unconnected, andthe shortage of likeable characters hurt the series as well. While the point at which comedybecomes silliness, and silliness stupidity, is entirely subjective, too often I felt cheated asa promising development deteriorated into absurdity. On a number of occasions, I was readyto give up entirely, but then there would be a moment of honest interaction betweencharacters, and I would be drawn to the next episode...only to be disappointed again.While there is no fan-service whatsoever in the series (except in the &#34;extra&#34; episode), and manyof the episodes seem to be intended for an audience of eight-year-olds, I would never let a childof mine watch this series, because the same message permeates every episode: that violence is anappropriate response to any situation. Naru, the main female character, though she says over andover that  there is nothing between her and Keitaro, has appointed herself minister of his morals.If he sees, says, or touches anything of which she doesn't approve, he gets clobbered. If hehappens to be alone with one of the younger girls for any reason, he must have lured her there forimmoral purposes...and gets booted over the horizon, with no appeal, no excuses accepted. Theonly complaint he ever makes is a plaintive &#34;What did I do this time?&#34; The question is neveranswered.With some series, you can say, &#34;Well, he deserved it, the creep,&#34; but Keitaro is a genuinely niceguy, if incurably inept. He deserves much better than he gets from most of the girls (only littleShinobu  treats him decently; in fact she is the one truly likeable character in the whole series).With the exception of samurai girl Motoko, there is virtually no character development in theseries either; everyone else is the same in episode 24 as they were at the start.The series runs about ten hours; I.M.O., ten minutes of pathos is not enough of a reason to sitthrough the rest.",2,missed the mark,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,2380,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'anime', 'best', 'delivering', 'two', 'types', 'story', 'battle', 'goodsorcerers', 'vs.', 'evil', 'Soul', 'Eater', 'Fairy', 'Tail', 'spring', 'mind', 'comedy/romance', 'stories', 'especially', 'include', 'touch', 'magical', 'supernatural', 'Girls', 'Bravo', 'Shuffle', 'representative', 'second', 'type', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Love', 'Hina', 'series', 'fellwell', 'short', 'expectations.While', 'often', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'touching', 'episodes', 'were', 'almost', 'unconnected', 'andthe', 'shortage', 'likeable', 'characters', 'hurt', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'point', 'silliness', 'silliness', 'stupidity', 'entirely', 'subjective', 'too', 'often', 'felt', 'cheated', 'promising', 'development', 'deteriorated', 'absurdity', 'number', 'occasions', 'was', 'readyto', 'give', 'up', 'entirely', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'moment', 'honest', 'interaction', 'betweencharacters', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'next', 'episode', 'only', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fan-service', 'whatsoever', 'series', '34', 'extra', '34', 'episode', 'episodes', 'seem', 'be', 'intended', 'audience', 'eight-year-olds', 'would', 'never', 'let', 'childof', 'mine', 'watch', 'series', 'same', 'message', 'permeates', 'episode', 'violence', 'anappropriate', 'response', 'situation', 'Naru', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'andover', 'nothing', 'Keitaro', 'appointed', 'minister', 'morals.If', 'touches', 'anything', ""n't"", 'approve', 'clobbered', 'hehappens', 'be', 'alone', 'one', 'younger', 'girls', 'reason', 'must', 'have', 'lured', 'forimmoral', 'purposes', 'booted', 'horizon', 'appeal', 'excuses', 'accepted', 'Theonly', 'complaint', 'ever', 'plaintive', '34', 'What', 'did', 'do', 'time', '34', 'question', 'neveranswered.With', 'series', 'can', 'say', '34', 'Well', 'deserved', 'creep', '34', 'Keitaro', 'genuinely', 'niceguy', 'incurably', 'inept', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'girls', 'only', 'treats', 'decently', 'fact', 'one', 'truly', 'likeable', 'character', 'whole', 'series', 'exception', 'samurai', 'girl', 'Motoko', 'virtually', 'character', 'development', 'theseries', 'everyone', 'else', 'same', 'episode', '24', 'were', 'start.The', 'series', 'ten', 'hours', 'I.M.O.', 'ten', 'minutes', 'pathos', 'not', 'enough', 'reason', 'sitthrough', 'rest']",Love Hina: Complete Series

The series main male character Keitaro pretty much is the main focus of the hilarity of the series, as he tries to find his lost childhood sweetheart while being the manager of an all female apartment complex.  Unlike the other series I recently got SHUFFLE Keitaro isn't the ladies man that they all fall for but is more of the abused toy that they take their frustrations on, either because of accidental mishaps or plain clumsiness on Keitaro's part, involving the usual tripping into the woman's chest or catching them undressing an the like.  The series characters are more fun to watch while listening to the series subbed instead of dubbed as with some animes the English voice cast seem to have at best a 30/70 decent voice cast,  I can't see 50/50 as there only seemed to be about only two to three dubbed actors/actresses who actually were doing a good job.  The video is standard format with the usual English/Japanese audio and a couple of extras mostly trailers and textless intro/ending songs,  but again it just seemed that if you're going to watch the episodes it was better watching them subbed.  So for the price and if you're looking for a light-hearted romantic anime give this a check out....",4,A Cute Anime Series But Sadly The Dubbing Needs Work,1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,1341,"['series', 'very', 'light-hearted', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'drama', 'seriousness', 'pretty', 'much', 'o.k', 'kind', 'show', 'series', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'Keitaro', 'pretty', 'much', 'main', 'focus', 'hilarity', 'series', 'find', 'lost', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'being', 'manager', 'female', 'apartment', 'complex', 'other', 'series', 'recently', 'got', 'SHUFFLE', 'Keitaro', ""n't"", 'ladies', 'man', 'fall', 'more', 'abused', 'toy', 'take', 'frustrations', 'accidental', 'mishaps', 'plain', 'clumsiness', 'Keitaro', 'part', 'involving', 'usual', 'tripping', 'woman', 'chest', 'catching', 'undressing', 'like', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'listening', 'series', 'subbed', 'instead', 'dubbed', 'animes', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'seem', 'have', 'best', '30/70', 'decent', 'voice', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', '50/50', 'only', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'dubbed', 'actors/actresses', 'who', 'actually', 'were', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'video', 'standard', 'format', 'usual', 'English/Japanese', 'audio', 'couple', 'extras', 'mostly', 'trailers', 'textless', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'again', 'just', 'seemed', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'episodes', 'was', 'better', 'watching', 'subbed', 'So', 'price', ""'re"", 'looking', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'anime', 'give', 'check', 'out']",Love Hina: Complete Series

1216412,A3Q5B4JKLLP2FL,B001M6SHD8,"Robert M. ""torpedo01""","[0, 0]",I watched this anime over the last 2 days and I really am indifferent about it.  You can tell it was made for TV because most of the fan service is really edited.  It also introduced the plot in the first two episodes but never really develops the plot until the last disk.  I would say that means you get the plot in the first 45 minutes then you get nothing but slapstick antics for about four hundred minutes of the six hundred.  You do get to know more about some of the characters but that also happens mostly on the final disk.  The four hundred minutes inbetween are filled with what are supposed to be cute adventures that really have no point.  I think the writers needed to make it last and used way too much filler and tried to keep the show going longer than it should have.  As for the comedy its really just the main character getting beaten up by the different girls.  It got old really fast and soon I was struggling to get through the series just to see how it ended.  The bonus episode was the only real redeeming laugh.  I laughed twice and it also contained 90% of the fan service.  I am just glad that finally got to the fourth disk and the plot finally ended.Likes:The bonus episode was solid gold.  I wish all the episodes had been that good.The girls in the show were interesting and all had different reasons for being the way they were.The animation was good but couldnt make up for the lack of plot.Dislikes:Too much filler.  The plot is introduced on the first episode then dropped until the final few shows.The writers tried to use the same lame joke over and over like the viewers are absolute idiots.  The main character trips grabs girl and gets hit then flies into the air repeatX200.The main character never really changes or grows based on his experience.  This makes me feel absolutely nothing for him.The plot doesnt have a clear ending at least to me.  According to the two girls at the end it might of been one of them or it could have been a completely different girl.  Does he get into Toyko U?  I guess your supposed to pick your own ending.,2,Plot Really Slow,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,2083,"['watched', 'anime', 'last', '2', 'days', 'really', 'am', 'indifferent', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'most', 'fan', 'service', 'really', 'edited', 'also', 'introduced', 'plot', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'never', 'really', 'plot', 'last', 'disk', 'would', 'say', 'get', 'plot', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'then', 'get', 'nothing', 'slapstick', 'antics', 'four', 'hundred', 'minutes', 'six', 'hundred', 'do', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'characters', 'also', 'mostly', 'final', 'disk', 'four', 'hundred', 'minutes', 'inbetween', 'are', 'filled', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'cute', 'adventures', 'really', 'have', 'point', 'think', 'writers', 'needed', 'make', 'last', 'used', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'filler', 'tried', 'keep', 'show', 'going', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'comedy', 'really', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'getting', 'beaten', 'up', 'different', 'girls', 'got', 'old', 'really', 'fast', 'soon', 'was', 'struggling', 'get', 'series', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'ended', 'bonus', 'episode', 'was', 'only', 'real', 'redeeming', 'laugh', 'laughed', 'twice', 'also', 'contained', '90', '%', 'fan', 'service', 'am', 'just', 'glad', 'finally', 'got', 'fourth', 'disk', 'plot', 'finally', 'bonus', 'episode', 'was', 'solid', 'gold', 'wish', 'episodes', 'had', 'been', 'good.The', 'girls', 'show', 'were', 'interesting', 'had', 'different', 'reasons', 'being', 'way', 'were.The', 'animation', 'was', 'good', 'couldnt', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'plot.Dislikes', 'Too', 'much', 'filler', 'plot', 'introduced', 'first', 'episode', 'then', 'dropped', 'final', 'few', 'shows.The', 'writers', 'tried', 'use', 'same', 'lame', 'joke', 'viewers', 'are', 'absolute', 'idiots', 'main', 'character', 'trips', 'grabs', 'girl', 'hit', 'then', 'air', 'repeatX200.The', 'main', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'changes', 'grows', 'based', 'experience', 'feel', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'him.The', 'plot', 'doesnt', 'have', 'clear', 'ending', 'least', 'According', 'two', 'girls', 'end', 'might', 'been', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'different', 'girl', 'get', 'Toyko', 'U', 'guess', 'supposed', 'pick', 'own', 'ending']",Love Hina: Complete Series

The hot-baths alone would pay more taxes each year than I made in 20 years.But that all could be ignored if there were any real writing in the series which is little more than teenage angst.On the other hand, there is no massive murder and death.

No universe saving by some uneducated boob who somehow can use mental telepathy all of a sudden to move spaceships through the light years between stars.In short, though this does continuously make silly sex jokes, and though it doesn't have a detectable story line, it is not a bad series.

1216417,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B001M6SHD8,Zack Davisson,"[22, 23]","""Love Hina"" is one of my all-time favorite anime series, and one of the few that ever made me laugh out loud.  It has been quite a few years since I visited the girls at the Hinata Lodge, and I am happy to say that the series is just as fun now as it first was when I watched it eight years ago.At first, glance, ""Love Hina"" seems formulaic. Lovable loser Keitaro dreams of success, but seems to fail at everything he tries.  Out of luck and plans, he goes to visit his Grandmother Hina and winds up the manager of the Hinata Lodge, a fantastically beautiful building with a backyard hot spring that is populated only by beautiful and feisty girls.  Keitaro, the incurable romantic, has long be searching for his ""promise girl,"" the love of his life that he knew back when he was about three years old, and to whom he promised they would grow up and attend Tokyo University (think Harvard) together, and get married.  He can't remember the girl's name, but he hasn't given up hope.  Just possibly, one of the gals at the Hinata Lodge is Keitaro's long-lost Promise Girl, and he just might find her if he doesn't get killed first.  Hijinks ensue.The storyline is pretty typical of ""harem""-style anime series, but somehow ""Love Hina"" does everything right.  Series creator Akamatsu Ken (Negima!) knows how to work an ensemble cast, giving each girl a distinct personality and story arc.  Sure, much of the hijinks comes from Keitaro doing his best only to wind up with panties on his head, or walking in on one of the girls naked, only to get a swift kick for his troubles.  That is standard Akamatsu fare. But ""Love Hina"" has some serious undercurrents and nuances that makes all the over-the-top stuff just that much funnier.The animated series differs from the manga, which is pretty common in Japanese anime.  I love both, personally, and felt that they did some really creative things with the ""Love Hina"" anime.  One of my favorite episodes features the kendo girl Makoto in the in the flickering, black and white style of old Samurai films.  There are other homages as well, to places as various as Godzilla and Pokemon and nods to other anime series.This release from Funimation is just great,  with nice picture and sound.  The subtitles can be a little hard to read in spots, when the white fades into the background, but that is my only really complaint.  I haven't listed to the English-dubbing because, well, I just generally don't like English-dubbing for anime.This set collects the original twenty-four episodes of the series plus the bonus twenty-fifth episode, which was not included on the previously releasedLove Hina Anime Legends Complete Collection.  The entire series is packed on four DVDs collected in slim cases.  I have heard that some people had trouble with the packaging, but mine arrived in perfect condition and is nice and sturdy, so no complaints there.  I love the slim-case packaging because, with the size of my anime collection, my shelves can use some relief.Not included in this collection are theLove Hina Christmas Movie, theLove Hina Spring Movie, or theLove Hina AgainOVA series, which have been released separately by other companies and as part of theLove Hina - Perfect Collection.  I can only assume (and hope!) that Funimation will be coming out with a follow-up ""Love Hina"" collection that completes the series.",5,Looking for the Promise Girl,1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,3360,"['Love', 'Hina', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'one', 'few', 'ever', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'been', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'visited', 'girls', 'Hinata', 'Lodge', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'series', 'just', 'fun', 'now', 'first', 'was', 'when', 'watched', 'eight', 'years', 'ago.At', 'first', 'glance', 'Love', 'Hina', 'formulaic', 'Lovable', 'loser', 'Keitaro', 'dreams', 'success', 'fail', 'everything', 'luck', 'plans', 'visit', 'Grandmother', 'Hina', 'up', 'manager', 'Hinata', 'Lodge', 'fantastically', 'beautiful', 'building', 'backyard', 'hot', 'spring', 'populated', 'only', 'beautiful', 'feisty', 'girls', 'Keitaro', 'incurable', 'romantic', 'long', 'be', 'searching', 'promise', 'girl', 'love', 'life', 'knew', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'three', 'years', 'old', 'whom', 'promised', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'attend', 'Tokyo', 'University', 'think', 'Harvard', 'together', 'get', 'married', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'girl', 'name', ""n't"", 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'Just', 'possibly', 'one', 'gals', 'Hinata', 'Lodge', 'Keitaro', 'long-lost', 'Promise', 'Girl', 'just', 'might', 'find', ""n't"", 'get', 'killed', 'first', 'Hijinks', 'ensue.The', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'typical', 'harem', '-style', 'anime', 'series', 'somehow', 'Love', 'Hina', 'everything', 'right', 'Series', 'creator', 'Akamatsu', 'Ken', 'Negima', 'how', 'work', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'giving', 'girl', 'distinct', 'personality', 'story', 'arc', 'Sure', 'much', 'hijinks', 'Keitaro', 'doing', 'best', 'only', 'wind', 'up', 'panties', 'head', 'walking', 'one', 'girls', 'naked', 'only', 'get', 'swift', 'kick', 'troubles', 'standard', 'Akamatsu', 'fare', 'Love', 'Hina', 'serious', 'undercurrents', 'nuances', 'over-the-top', 'stuff', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'funnier.The', 'animated', 'series', 'differs', 'manga', 'pretty', 'common', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'love', 'personally', 'felt', 'did', 'really', 'creative', 'things', 'Love', 'Hina', 'anime', 'One', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'kendo', 'girl', 'Makoto', 'flickering', 'black', 'white', 'style', 'old', 'Samurai', 'films', 'are', 'other', 'homages', 'well', 'places', 'as', 'various', 'Godzilla', 'Pokemon', 'nods', 'other', 'anime', 'series.This', 'release', 'Funimation', 'just', 'great', 'nice', 'picture', 'sound', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'read', 'spots', 'when', 'white', 'fades', 'background', 'only', 'really', 'complaint', 'have', ""n't"", 'listed', 'English-dubbing', 'well', 'just', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'English-dubbing', 'anime.This', 'set', 'original', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'series', 'bonus', 'twenty-fifth', 'episode', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'previously', 'releasedLove', 'Hina', 'Anime', 'Legends', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'entire', 'series', 'packed', 'four', 'DVDs', 'collected', 'slim', 'cases', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'had', 'trouble', 'packaging', 'mine', 'arrived', 'perfect', 'condition', 'nice', 'sturdy', 'complaints', 'there', 'love', 'slim-case', 'packaging', 'size', 'anime', 'collection', 'shelves', 'can', 'use', 'relief.Not', 'included', 'collection', 'are', 'Hina', 'Christmas', 'Movie', 'theLove', 'Hina', 'Spring', 'Movie', 'theLove', 'Hina', 'AgainOVA', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'separately', 'other', 'companies', 'part', 'theLove', 'Hina', 'Perfect', 'Collection', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'hope', 'Funimation', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'follow-up', 'Love', 'Hina', 'collection', 'series']",Love Hina: Complete Series
