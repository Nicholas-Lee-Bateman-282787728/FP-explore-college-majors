899312,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0008KLV8M,Nicholas Carroll,"[8, 15]","Its a testament to this show's popularity that Britney Spears decided to have her own reality show about married life with Kevin Federline. However, the fact that she peddled her show on a third-rate network wasn't going to help get her career out of the slump its currently in. For all of Jessica Simpson's onscreen ""ditzyness"", she is a lot more marketing savvy than Britney could ever dream of being. Its a remarkable study in who those two ladies have developed their careers, and Jessica continues to surprise and amaze while Britney seems destined for trailer-park oblivion.This second and third season is somewhat of a letdown from Season 1, when everything was fresh. Now its more of the same, but what surprises me most about seasons 2 and 3 was how little ""newlywed snuggling""/flirtation goes on. It almost looks as though Nick and Jessica are growing more tired of each other and maintain their distance from each other. With all the cameras, pappa-nazis, celebrity magazine articles predicting the demise of their marriage, and growing career pressures, it does appear in these two seasons that a strain is showing. For the sake of their marriage, I hope they know not to sign anymore commitments to live their lives in front of the camera. All is well and good for us voyeurs who are curious about the lives of the rich and beautiful, but I actually do care about the two of them and hope theirs is a marriage to last a lifetime in defiance of all the naysayers. I find Jessica Simpson to be an endearing, sweet, and funny young lady. In the episode where she keeps saying ""Gawww"" in place of ""God"", everyone else, including her hubby Nick tells her to ""shut up!"" because she's not saying it right. Well...am I the only one who finds that trait in her simply adorable? She can coo ""gawww!"" in my ear all day long. I think she's great and I'm looking forward to seeing her as Daisy Duke when ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" hits theaters in August. She makes the show worth watching, and Britney only wishes she had the marketing savvy that Jessica has. This one is the real deal...Britney and Kevin's show is a pale imitation that hopefully won't make it to DVD.",4,Oh my GAWWWW!!!,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,2166,"['testament', 'show', 'popularity', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'decided', 'have', 'own', 'reality', 'show', 'married', 'life', 'Kevin', 'Federline', 'However', 'fact', 'peddled', 'show', 'third-rate', 'network', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'help', 'get', 'career', 'slump', 'currently', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'onscreen', 'ditzyness', 'lot', 'more', 'marketing', 'savvy', 'Britney', 'could', 'ever', 'dream', 'being', 'remarkable', 'study', 'who', 'two', 'ladies', 'have', 'developed', 'careers', 'Jessica', 'surprise', 'amaze', 'Britney', 'destined', 'trailer-park', 'oblivion.This', 'second', 'third', 'season', 'somewhat', 'letdown', 'Season', '1', 'when', 'everything', 'was', 'fresh', 'Now', 'more', 'same', 'what', 'most', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'was', 'how', 'little', 'newlywed', 'snuggling', '/flirtation', 'almost', 'Nick', 'Jessica', 'are', 'growing', 'more', 'tired', 'other', 'maintain', 'distance', 'other', 'cameras', 'pappa-nazis', 'celebrity', 'magazine', 'articles', 'predicting', 'demise', 'marriage', 'growing', 'career', 'pressures', 'appear', 'two', 'seasons', 'strain', 'showing', 'sake', 'marriage', 'hope', 'know', 'not', 'sign', 'anymore', 'commitments', 'live', 'lives', 'front', 'camera', 'well', 'good', 'voyeurs', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'lives', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'actually', 'do', 'care', 'two', 'hope', 'marriage', 'last', 'lifetime', 'defiance', 'naysayers', 'find', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'be', 'endearing', 'sweet', 'funny', 'young', 'lady', 'episode', 'where', 'saying', 'Gawww', 'place', 'God', 'everyone', 'else', 'including', 'hubby', 'Nick', 'shut', 'up', 'not', 'saying', 'right', 'Well', 'am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'trait', 'simply', 'adorable', 'can', 'coo', 'gawww', 'ear', 'day', 'long', 'think', 'great', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Daisy', 'Duke', 'when', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'theaters', 'August', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'Britney', 'only', 'had', 'marketing', 'savvy', 'Jessica', 'one', 'real', 'deal', 'Britney', 'Kevin', 'show', 'pale', 'imitation', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'DVD']",Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica - The Complete Second and Third Seasons

Jessica and Nick are 2 of the dumbest people on the planet. Nick's tatoo's are painful to look at (u can have it removed by laser surgery, fool!). As for the video to 'these boots were made for walking', anyone with even a drop of class will be totally embarassed at Jessica's childish squeaking, clumsy dancing, tacky dressing and attitude. All Nick and Jessica do on the show is travel to the recording studio (as they are singers anyone would have figured out that they would drop in to record music sometime!), watching TV, doing laundry and having ridiculous fights over chicken/tuna. Tuna is a fish, Jessica, dumba--! Jessica's 'desert' products are bad quality and certainly not edible, I tried them and felt the urge to vomit! To all the newlyweds fans, Buffalo wings are made of chicken, not buffalo. Watch real TV shows like Nip/tuck, The O.C, Desperate housewives or One tree hill.TO THE NEWLYWEDS FAN YOLANDA:1.) Calling me 'g--' is downright ridiculous when you obviously have a huge crush on Jessica Simpson. If someone shows me a picture of an attractive lady I'll call her beautiful or pretty, not 'drop dead gorgeous' (this phrase I reserve strictly for the guys).2.) How can u call someone 'ugly' or 'overweight' without even meeting them? Since when does being a size 6 qualify as being overweight? If so, u need to get help for anorexia.3.) I am a first year medic, meanwhile u are living in a trailer park judging by your pathetic violent threats via amazon.com! How are u going to 'beat' me when u don't even know who I am or where I live? Loser!4.) U are the one who has a shortage of male admirers, not me. U think Nick Lachey is gorgeous and would immediately accept if he asked u out on a date, I WOULD NOT. Nick requires a rhinoplasty (nose job) but as he is not a real man he would be too scared to have it done but if he did would want mommy to hold his hand throughout surgery.5.)If Nick and Jessica are the 'smartest people' on the planet, then quite frankly America and the rest of the world should be concerned.
