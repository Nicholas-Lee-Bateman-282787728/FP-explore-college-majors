I feel that gay, caucasian males will appreciate it more than any other group because this is their own Harvey. Mine is caucasian, but he lives in a diverse neighbourhood. Even the depiction of San Francisco was whitened. I know I have watched a lot of 'white' films, but I used to live in San Francisco, among other places, and there were lots of diverse people. But in the movie the diversity disappeared. On a lighter note, they had great discussions and they tried to make the movie really interesting as I said before. Unfortunately, I was not able to access the special features because it refused to play in my DVD player. For people who can't access the special features, I recommend buying The Times of Harvey Milk as well as other DVDs and books about him even if you're able to access the special features. I love how Sean Penn included other groups in the struggle for civil rights because it showed that Harvey was open-minded and could see the big picture.

1190478,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001FB55KI,Acute Observer,"[3, 16]","The film begins with news films of police arrests as part of a crackdown. Then it is November 1978 and a man is recording his thoughts about fear of an assassination. [Guilt feelings?] The film shows Harvey Milk's personality through a flashback to his earlier life in New York city. Milk relocates to San Francisco as if he would be welcome there. Businessman Milk makes plans to take over the neighborhood, and it seems to work. [A group that is organized has advantages over ordinary people.] Milk wants an organization to protect its members, like other groups. He runs for city supervisor on a platform of vague promises and loses. Even with a three-piece suit he loses again and again. What is he for?The singer Anita Bryant becomes politically active. A redrawn political boundary creates a new opportunity. [Was this an accident?] Anger is channeled into a parade. A man who can manipulate a crowd and control votes is a politician. Milk blames Anita Bryant for causing this reaction. Milk gets a new campaign manager, one with experience who can get newspaper endorsements. [How much did they have to pay for this? They don't explain how it works.] Milk gets elected by appealing to a wider range of people. Milk wants a state-wide referendum for ""gay rights"" and a city ordinance. Newly elected Dan White wants to keep a psychiatric center out of his district. A new law is proposed to purge homosexual teachers ""and their supporters"". Its purpose is to prevent perversion of students. Milk has problems with his boyfriends. There is a conflict over the plan to defeat Proposition 6. Is there enough state-wide support to defeat this bill?Milk reneges on his promise to vote against that psychiatric center. [Why put it in a residential neighborhood?] Cities vote against laws that control rental housing. The film shows how people are manipulated for political ends. Will the plan work? [Is there a hidden agenda behind low salaries for elected politicians? Yes.] Does Milk handle his personal life correctly? Why did his boyfriends attempt suicide? Is there some hidden fault? Milk the politician talks rhetoric to a crowd. He has a debate with another politician over a state proposition. Could that tragedy have been prevented? The advice from national politicians may show their control by corporate rulers. Could the ""gay rights"" movement be designed to foster a reaction among voters to back corporate political candidates? Proposition 6 passes, Dan White resigns. Milk threatens Mayor Moscone with political reprisals if he allows Dan White to return. [Is that opera meant to be symbolic?] Dan White enters City Hall through a window. There is an ending like some operas, but without music and singing.This film could be edited for quickness. Did it really explain what caused this tragedy? It seemed like an accident from a personality clash rather than political rivalry. Could a ""lone gunman"" actually be working for hidden interests? Could sugar-rich ""junk food"" really be a cause for murder or just be an excuse for something that was omitted from this film? Political assassinations are rare, most murders are the result of love or money (lust or greed). The film does not mention ""Jim Jones"" and his organization. I think Anita Bryant was right to object about school teachers who push their homosexual agenda.",2,Did Success Spoil Harvey Milk?,1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,3335,"['film', 'news', 'films', 'police', 'arrests', 'part', 'crackdown', 'Then', 'November', '1978', 'man', 'recording', 'thoughts', 'fear', 'assassination', 'Guilt', 'feelings', ']', 'film', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'personality', 'flashback', 'earlier', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'Milk', 'San', 'Francisco', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'there', 'Businessman', 'Milk', 'plans', 'take', 'over', 'neighborhood', 'work', '[', 'A', 'group', 'organized', 'advantages', 'ordinary', 'people', ']', 'Milk', 'organization', 'protect', 'members', 'other', 'groups', 'city', 'supervisor', 'platform', 'vague', 'promises', 'Even', 'three-piece', 'suit', 'again', 'again', 'What', 'singer', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'politically', 'active', 'redrawn', 'political', 'boundary', 'new', 'opportunity', '[', 'Was', 'accident', ']', 'Anger', 'channeled', 'parade', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'manipulate', 'crowd', 'control', 'votes', 'politician', 'Milk', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'causing', 'reaction', 'Milk', 'new', 'campaign', 'manager', 'one', 'experience', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'newspaper', 'endorsements', '[', 'How', 'much', 'did', 'have', 'pay', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', ']', 'Milk', 'elected', 'appealing', 'wider', 'range', 'people', 'Milk', 'state-wide', 'referendum', 'gay', 'rights', 'city', 'ordinance', 'Newly', 'elected', 'Dan', 'White', 'keep', 'psychiatric', 'center', 'district', 'new', 'law', 'proposed', 'purge', 'homosexual', 'teachers', 'supporters', 'purpose', 'prevent', 'perversion', 'students', 'Milk', 'problems', 'boyfriends', 'conflict', 'plan', 'defeat', 'Proposition', '6', 'there', 'enough', 'state-wide', 'support', 'defeat', 'bill', 'Milk', 'promise', 'vote', 'psychiatric', 'center', '[', 'Why', 'put', 'residential', 'neighborhood', ']', 'Cities', 'vote', 'laws', 'control', 'rental', 'housing', 'film', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'manipulated', 'political', 'ends', 'Will', 'plan', 'work', '[', 'there', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'low', 'salaries', 'elected', 'politicians', 'Yes', ']', 'Does', 'Milk', 'handle', 'personal', 'life', 'correctly', 'Why', 'did', 'boyfriends', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'there', 'hidden', 'fault', 'politician', 'talks', 'rhetoric', 'crowd', 'debate', 'politician', 'state', 'proposition', 'Could', 'tragedy', 'have', 'been', 'prevented', 'advice', 'national', 'politicians', 'may', 'show', 'control', 'corporate', 'rulers', 'Could', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'be', 'designed', 'foster', 'reaction', 'voters', 'back', 'corporate', 'political', 'candidates', 'Proposition', '6', 'passes', 'Dan', 'White', 'resigns', 'Milk', 'Mayor', 'Moscone', 'political', 'reprisals', 'Dan', 'White', 'return', '[', 'opera', 'meant', 'be', 'symbolic', ']', 'Dan', 'White', 'enters', 'City', 'Hall', 'window', 'ending', 'operas', 'music', 'singing.This', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'edited', 'quickness', 'Did', 'really', 'explain', 'what', 'caused', 'tragedy', 'seemed', 'accident', 'personality', 'clash', 'rather', 'political', 'rivalry', 'Could', 'lone', 'gunman', 'actually', 'be', 'working', 'hidden', 'interests', 'Could', 'sugar-rich', 'junk', 'food', 'really', 'be', 'cause', 'murder', 'just', 'be', 'excuse', 'something', 'was', 'omitted', 'film', 'Political', 'assassinations', 'are', 'rare', 'most', 'murders', 'are', 'result', 'love', 'money', 'lust', 'greed', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'Jim', 'Jones', 'organization', 'think', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'was', 'right', 'object', 'school', 'teachers', 'who', 'push', 'homosexual', 'agenda']",Milk

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 3]","Sean Penn gives a sensational performance in this movie which takes a wide-angle view of the early days of the struggle for gay rights. Penn brings to life Harvey Milk, a brave, charming pioneer who transforms himself into a brilliant politician becoming the first openly-gay person to be elected to a major political office in the United States. The movie also draws a fair and balanced picture of the man who shot him, a fellow council member called Dan White. Josh Brolin gives a wonderful performance of the troubled White without demonizing him. The movie hints he may have been a closeted gay man himself although there is no evidence of this in the historical record.But Milk is at the heart of everything that happens here. We see his own mixed-up personal life, from the moment he meets one lover in the New York subway system, to the suicide of a second lover. Penn doesn't try to make him some kind of mythical hero but his fundamental decency always comes through. Not so for his opponents, especially the noxious, self-righteous Anita Bryant (where did she disappear to??) who campaigns to fire all homosexual teachers.This movie, although it has a sad ending, is never depressing and gives us hope that we have come a long way since then in the struggle for basic fairness for gay people, although there is still a long way to go.",5,Absorbing look at struggle for gay rights,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,1344,"['Sean', 'Penn', 'sensational', 'performance', 'movie', 'wide-angle', 'view', 'early', 'days', 'struggle', 'gay', 'rights', 'Penn', 'life', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'brave', 'charming', 'pioneer', 'who', 'brilliant', 'politician', 'becoming', 'first', 'openly-gay', 'person', 'be', 'elected', 'major', 'political', 'office', 'United', 'States', 'movie', 'also', 'fair', 'balanced', 'picture', 'man', 'who', 'shot', 'fellow', 'council', 'member', 'called', 'Dan', 'White', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'troubled', 'White', 'demonizing', 'movie', 'hints', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'closeted', 'gay', 'man', 'evidence', 'historical', 'record.But', 'Milk', 'heart', 'everything', 'here', 'see', 'own', 'mixed-up', 'personal', 'life', 'moment', 'one', 'lover', 'New', 'York', 'subway', 'system', 'suicide', 'second', 'lover', 'Penn', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'kind', 'mythical', 'hero', 'fundamental', 'decency', 'always', 'through', 'Not', 'so', 'opponents', 'especially', 'noxious', 'self-righteous', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'where', 'did', 'disappear', 'who', 'campaigns', 'fire', 'homosexual', 'teachers.This', 'movie', 'sad', 'ending', 'never', 'depressing', 'hope', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'then', 'struggle', 'basic', 'fairness', 'gay', 'people', 'still', 'long', 'way', 'go']",Milk

He seemed selfish and somewhat grandstanding. But then, maybe that's the point of the film, to show him as he truly was - an individual who was a hero to the community, while being a normal, fallible human being at the same time. And on that level, this is an amazing success. Sean Penn completely disappears into and shines in the lead role, and James Franco should also be noted for his strong supporting role.

And even though I enjoyed the movie and thought it was really good, I didn't think I would be watching it on repeated showings, not to mention space and money issues.But I'm glad I did buy it. The movie is even better on the second viewing and was beautifully told, and I'm sure I'll be watching it many more times.MILK is a bio-pic about San Francisco, City Controller - Harvey Milk. In the 70s, he was the second openly gay person to be elected to public office throughout the country and the first openly gay man elected anywhere. He fought vigorously for gay rights until he was murdered by fellow city controller Dan White (who also killed the mayor of SF George Moscone at the same time).The film does a pretty good job of showing the personal and private life of this remarkable person, and shows how Harvey Milk may have thought himself to be an ""ordinary man,"" but he did extraordinary things, which still reverberate to this day. Even the portrayal of Dan White was sensitive as the film shows a troubled man and not the homophobic assassin of legend. And despite ending tragically for three people and those around them--Milk, Moscone, and White who committed suicide two years after he was released from prison--the movie does inspire hope.This is a movie that should be passed down from generation-to-generation because it shows how we are responsible for the young people who are going  to take our place. Without Harvey Milk and others like him, today's LGBT people wouldn't have half as many rights as we do nor the feeling that we can accomplish great things.The bonuses are short but sweet and include:***DELETED SCENES 3:45/Three scenes that don't make it in the film:--recurring dream--jack throws pottery--harvey the clown***REMEMBERING HARVEY 13:20--the actual people represented in the film talk about harvey milk; among them anne kronenberg and cleve jones***HOLLYWOOD COMES TO SF 14:32--producers and actors discuss ""milk"" and the person; writer dustin lance black, james franco and josh brolin among others, but sean penn doesn't appear***MARCHING FOR EQUALITY 7:57--cleve jones, gilbert baker and daniel nicoletta among others talk about the re-enactment of the ""march through the castro"" from the film and how it compares to the reality of that time, with footage of the behind the scenes as filming takes placeAnyway, I recommend MILK DVD even if you've already seen it because like I said the story itself is timeless and the execution was brilliant.

1190482,AGEIT17HENDIS,B001FB55KI,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 3]","Sean Penn certainly deserved his Oscar for his performance as early San Francisco gay rights activist, politician and social gadfly Harvey Milk. Moreover, for a commercially done effort this one is not too hagiographic or heavy on the dramatic episodes when they are not called for. The only thing that I would add is something of a historic note. In the year 2008 one could reasonably expect to be nominated for and even to win an Oscar for playing a homosexual, a taboo subject for most of mainstream cinematic history. And that is to the good. What I would note is the distance that has been traveled since the 1984 film documentary ""The Times Of Harvey Milk"". That film (an Oscar-winner), a more sober retrospective of Harvey Milk, made on a shoestring, played in, at best, art houses. One can argue for the virtues than a wider circulation of well-done commercial has but I will say, after a recent renewed viewing of that documentary, politically and socially it presented a much better picture of the real Harvey Milk and the real struggle for gay rights, including the underestimated backlash then and now.",4,The Life And Times,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,1114,"['Sean', 'Penn', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'early', 'San', 'Francisco', 'gay', 'rights', 'activist', 'politician', 'social', 'gadfly', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Moreover', 'commercially', 'done', 'effort', 'one', 'not', 'too', 'hagiographic', 'heavy', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'called', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'add', 'something', 'historic', 'note', 'year', '2008', 'one', 'could', 'reasonably', 'expect', 'be', 'nominated', 'even', 'win', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'homosexual', 'taboo', 'subject', 'most', 'mainstream', 'cinematic', 'history', 'good', 'What', 'would', 'note', 'distance', 'been', 'traveled', '1984', 'film', 'documentary', 'Times', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'film', 'Oscar-winner', 'more', 'sober', 'retrospective', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'made', 'shoestring', 'played', 'best', 'art', 'houses', 'One', 'can', 'argue', 'virtues', 'wider', 'circulation', 'well-done', 'commercial', 'will', 'say', 'recent', 'renewed', 'viewing', 'documentary', 'politically', 'socially', 'presented', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'real', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'real', 'struggle', 'gay', 'rights', 'including', 'underestimated', 'backlash', 'then', 'now']",Milk

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[1, 3]","It really is hard to believe.......how different things were only a few decades ago regarding basic rights for homosexuals. Of course I cannot watch this movie and not think of a man named Charlie Howard,who in 1984 was murdered in my home state of Maine simply for whering makeup and carrying a purse. The subject of this film gave his life after doing a lot more then that,helping to open to door for something very significant. In the post Stonewall years in America there were still bars being raided,people being denied housing and jobs only because of their sexual orientation.That says nothing for similar injustices towards ethnic minorities and women. San Francisco in the 1970's was of course a counterpoint to these issues,as they say ""a million voices raising a million issues"".Well this centers on one of them;the story of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) moving to an area of the city known as Castro,a growing hotbed for the gay community in city,along with his young beau. Together the two open up a camera shop that grows into something more significant. Before he knows it Milk,someone who arrived in the city as closeted and inactive as any homosexual man of his generation finds himself more then a little significant to the people of the Castro as a community activist. This all culminates in Milk entering local politics as a three time candidate for local supervisor,an election he eventually wins. He uses his newfound power to lobby against the Anita Bryant-led anti gay campaign and maintains his activist nature. In the meantime there is of course that sense that he's going to run into trouble of some sort from Dan White,the man running against him who grows seemingly more emotionally unstable as his political career begins to spin out of control. If you know how this story ends before seeing this movie then...well you'll see the motivations that lead to the tragedy. But this is an excellent film that brings to the public something many may have never been exposed to before. The civil rights movement,the holocaust and many other human injustices have been documented in many well known and wonderful film epics and frankly,it's about time a story like this get put out here in such a well done fasion.Sean Penn justly won an oscar for this role and in terms of him and everyone involved it's a complete triumph.

My recollection is not great but I am at least broadly aware of his story.  This was the extent of my knowledge of the film.""Milk"" is a biopic of the life and times of Harvey Milk from the time he moved from New York to San Francisco and his brief political career.  He tried three times and failed to be elected to city government.  On his fourth attempt, he was successful.  In so doing, he became the first openly gay politician to be elected in the United States.  Such an event would not be a big deal today but in the late 1970s it was certainly worth noting.During his time in government, Milk locked horns with Dan White, a man who was as distant from Milk and his lifestyle as would be possible.  It was their differences and White's dismissal that bring the story to its denouement.  Milk and Mayor George Moscone meet a gruesome end.Harvey Milk is played by Sean Penn who, in a loose sense, is also the narrator for much of the film.  Penn is excellent in this role and his reputation should be burnished as a result.

1190485,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001FB55KI,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","There is no denying that `Milk' is a very good film; a biopic that is engrossing and at times very moving.  Thanks in large part to some stellar casting (seriously, there is rarely a sour note when concerning the performances) as well as Gus Van Sant's surprisingly graceful direction (he's always `graceful' but this is truly a different side to him) the film is at the very least entertaining and insightful.  That said; when the film credits began to roll I didn't really feel anything.  I turned to my best friend and said ""well that was good"", but that was exactly how I felt.`Milk' was good.I guess maybe I was expecting too much, I don't know, but I don't find this the utter masterpiece that a lot of people are claiming it to be.  I felt that it was slightly (or maybe not so slightly) manipulative, and this took away from the raw feeling of honesty in Van Sant's direction.  The films primary focus was constantly on politics and so we are never truly given a chance to connect emotionally to the characters and thus when each and every major character (aside from White) appears to be flawless we are left rather apathetic.  I'm not going to get into a huge debate (with myself or with those who so chose to comment on my particular thoughts) about the need for biographical flaws, because each and every film is different.  Take the Oscar winning `A Beautiful Mind' for instance.  The entire weight of the film hinged solely on our emotional connection to John Nash, and so to expose his supposed flaws (sporadic flings with men while he was married to Alicia) would have only lessened our view of him and may have tampered with the desired resulting effect on the audience.  With `Milk' though, I feel that making Harvey Milk a flawless martyr took away from what made him human.  In the battle for equal rights one has to feel as though they are equals, but `Milk' showed almost no equality.It felt very one-sided to me.This isn't a major flaw, but it is a flaw to say the least.  In the end I didn't feel like I got to know the real Harvey Milk but more or less a biased view of the `hero' he was.  I'm not saying he wasn't a hero to a certain community (I find it rather insulting that this site won't let me use the three letter word that starts with a G and ends with a Y even though I see it on plenty of other reviews) but in order to make this film translate to everyone their needed to be a larger sense of genuine (believable) humanity.  Again, I go back to the fact that the film is largely a very political film, and so we aren't given a very detailed look at Harvey's personal life aside from a few trysts and work relationships.  Those relationships appear to be more subplots and thus seem less important, where I feel that the whole point of a biopic is to come to know the real man, and that requires knowing his life away from the spotlight.I don't want to seem like I'm tearing the film apart, because like I said, it is a good film and at times it is very good.  The acting is such a huge highlight that it helps cement the film and thus keep our interest glued throughout.  Without that strong personal connection though, the acting seems less like a fluid progression of character and more like a series of dramatically constructed scenes.  Take Dan White for instance, the films central villain.  I never felt like I got a true sense of who this man was.  He appeared to be nothing more than a selfish and ignorant man who had anger issues.  Sure, Brolin's portrayal was brilliant, especially the drunk confrontation scene, but there was no genuine character development in the script.  Thus he felt more like the `token bad guy' to me than a real person.  Same with Scott, Franco's character, who felt more like the suffering spouse than anything else.  Again, what he did with what he was given was amazing (talk about adding notes to a one-note character) but in the end the character felt unfinished.I think that `Milk' would have been aided by a longer running time, because then maybe we would have had the chance to truly flesh out the man inside of Harvey and not just the goal he had in mind.  His aspirations were admirable, but I wanted to really know him, warts and all.  Beings that the films primary focus was on the message then exposing Milk's flaws would have only deepened our understanding of the man, not take away from the message.So, my feelings on `Milk' are this; the film is good (I give it a low B), but it could have really been wonderful.  I thought that Van Sant's direction was inspired (he definitely went commercial, but no where near the `sell out' kind of commercial he went with `Good Will Hunting'), especially the effortless additions of raw footage, and that murder scene is probably the single best scene in the film, and possible the `scene of the year'.  I also thought that all performances stood out and elevated their material (while I was totally rooting for Rourke, Penn's complete transformation here was a very worthy Oscar win), but the script in my opinion was lacking.  It was one-sided and manipulative and, while it gave us an insightful look at the political stance of this man, it failed to really uncover who he was.",4,It's so focused on the message that it fails

(Widescreen),Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,American Gangster (2-Disc Unrated Extended Edition)) has morphed into one of this country's finest actors.  All that and Diane Lane, too.  It's good to be Josh Brolin.  He plays killer Dan White in a subtly eerie way that is increasingly unsettling, both to Penn's character and to the viewing audience.  You get a true appreciation for the nuance of Brolin's portrayal when you compare it to, say, Diego Luna's over-the-top scenery chewing.The film's denouement is chilling - director Gus Van Sant's re-staging of one of the 'flashbulb memory' moments of American history will chill you to the bone...especially in the way that it soundlessly tracks a freakishly calm Dan White from office to office.

Emile Hirsch, James Franco and Josh Brolin are stand-outs as well. So I will not dwell on it here. I want to talk about the movie .The immersive approach of using actual footage from the era with the actual movie works brilliantly. it conveys the struggle of the era without over-dramatization or glossing over. Capturing the rigth balance is the key to the movies success.Just because the title of the movie is Milk does not mean that it is just a movie about Harvey Milk. It is so much more than that. It symbolizes not only the struggle of the gay/lesbian community but also of the struggles of a person who finally finds a purpose in life. Some find that early in their life and some like Harvey Milk in their 40s.

1190493,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B001FB55KI,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","This is not simply the story of Harvey Milk. This is the soul and essence of Harvey Milk, and of the times he lived in San Francisco. I lived there then. I remember it all so well. This is a fitting memorial to a courageous man.Sean Penn IS Harvey Milk, and Josh Brolin does a good job of depicting Dan White, he of the sugar neurosis/psychosis. The Twinkies Defense. Only Victor Garber does not look like Mayor Moscone. Sort of sounds like him, and does a credible job in the role for anyone who did not live in those times. Rather violent times, they were.The story opens with Harvey preparing to celebrate his 40th birthday. He's living in New York, selling insurance I believe it was, and thoroughly closeted. A handsome young man gives him a close brush in the subway stairway, and they strike up a conversation. It is clear that this encounter is one which functions as a signal for closeted gays, as they neither one have any doubts of the others intentions. Scott, the young man, helps Harvey celebrate his 40th birthday, and then decides to go with him to San Francisco to escape from his closet. (Apparently Scott never had been in one.)San Francisco, 1970. Homosexuality was still illegal, but a tolerance was traditional, and the Halloween night parade on Polk Street was famous for its flaming queens -- the only day of the year it was legal to wear drag in public. But Harvey rented a small store in the Castro, and helped the Castro neighborhood emerge as a gay haven. He ran a camera shop, but it was also a hang-out and eventually got deeply involved in Harvey's political campaigns.Harvey's politics were liberal, of course, as they would necessarily be. But that does not mean he had the backing of the Democratic Party, or even that portion of the party that was known to be gay. The editor of the Advocate, a gay rights newspaper, was not exactly closeted, but he down-played his gay life. Wore classy business suits and hob-nobbed with the Democratic Party elite. They couldn't handle Harvey's up-front, out-of-the-closet style.Harvey believed that gays should come out of the closet in order for people who thought that queers were some sort of dreadful monsters to learn that those who they worked with, the members of their families, churches, neighborhoods, included gays. One line he used all the time which was not much used in the movie was ""We Are Everywhere,"" although the idea certainly was.He ran for city supervisor two or three times before the city changed to district voting for supervisors instead of the prior city-wide elections, where the top eight vote-getters throughout the city became supervisors. Harvey and his supporters also worked very hard on the campaign to change to district voting. That was the first I had heard of him. I lived near Polk Street, the older gay neighborhood, and was not very political. But when district voting began, we were all startled to find that the Castro was already well organized and had their candidate in place. And he won.The big fight at that time was the Briggs Initiative, Proposition 6, as I recall. Or perhaps 9. Anyway, the idea was to allow school boards to fire anyone who was gay OR anyone who supported a gay in the school faculty. Briggs was heavily backed by Anita Bryant, who was making a name for herself nationwide in her anti-gay campaign. We didn't know it at the time, but her husband had left her because he came out gay.Harvey organized the No on 6 campaign, and challenged Briggs to public debates. He was well informed, charming, amusing, and unflappable. Briggs was a stuffed shirt prude. His understanding of the gay community was much what was popular at the time: that since gays don't reproduce [oh, really?], they have to recruit. In one famous scene, Milk points out that he was raised by heterosexual parents, taught by heterosexual teachers, and lived in a straight world. How then did he become gay? He explained that if children really emulated their teachers that much, there would be a heck of a lot more nuns in the country!Meanwhile, Dan White became the mayor of the middle-class Catholic neighborhood just to the south of the Castro. He was not only conservative, he was pretty religious, and an ex-fireman and ex-cop. He was also in over his head in accepting the position of supervisor, intellectually, emotionally and economically. He hated Harvey and everything he stood for. He asked Harvey to support an ordinance to raise the salaries of the supervisors, but would not trade a vote in favor of anything of importance to Harvey. Harvey thought the salary increase would be a bad idea, because they would be up for re-election and people would feel they were too greedy.Finally, when Dan White's ordinance for a pay increase was defeated, he resigned. Just after he handed in his resignation, the Police Union had a conference with him. After that, he asked Mayor Moscone to re-appoint him to the seat on the board he had just vacated, effectively rescinding his resignation. When Moscone refused to do so, White crawled in a window in the maintenance area of City Hall with a gun in his pocket. The rest you know; it was in all the news.The movie is based around a set of audio tapes that Milk had left with his effects, marked to be opened if he was assassinated. He knew he was a target, and frankly, may even have known that White was that unstable. He had gotten threats so many times during his political career that he simply accepted the idea that his was a risky position. He was right.This is a five-star movie, not only for its authenticity, but for its heart.",5,Brilliant Biography of a Brilliant Man,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,5600,"['not', 'simply', 'story',

1190495,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B001FB55KI,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[1, 2]","Gus Van Sant`s `Milk' opens with black and white newsreel from the 1950`s and 1960's.  Well groomed men hide their faces as they are hustled into police vans.  Their names will be printed in the following day`s paper.  Such was life for a gay person before Harvey Milk came along.This quiet masterpiece of a film shows just how much has changed over the last 40 years.  The civil rights (by no means complete!) that we GLBT people enjoy today are in large part due to the tenacity, courage and self-sacrifice of one man, Harvey Milk.At age forty, Harvey Milk made a monumental decision for both himself and for gay men and women ever since:  to live a life free of shame, fear and self-loathing.  Harvey Milk knocked the closet door clean off.Gus Van Sant`s film should be viewed and appreciated for what it is:  the tragic journey of one individual who sought to make the world a better place for all.  `Milk' is a historical drama in the best sense of the word.  Thanks to a fine screenplay by Lance Duncan Black, the film climbs each momentous step in Harvey Milk`s life.It starts off with Harvey`s fortieth birthday where he has just picked up a date in a New York subway.  After a night together, Harvey and new lover, Scott, are off to San Francisco to make history.  There, Harvey successfully breaks into local business and soon ventures into local politics disgusted by the SFPD`s bigotry and indifference to homophobic violence.  After suffering defeat after defeat, Harvey manages to become a city supervisor and the first ever openly gay politician in America.  As city supervisor, Milk battles down one of the country`s most odious attempts at squelching civil liberties:  California`s Proposition 6 which sought to deny homosexuals equal protection in employment.  Through his state-wide debating tour and uncanny ability to make compromises with the right people (Governors Brown and Reagan, President Carter), Milk helps defeats the proposition.  And then it all ends in a fury of gunshots in 1978.  The film leaves you with the feeling that Milk, like MLK and Robert Kennedy, was cut down before he had reached his stride, a stride so measured and self-confident that even greater goals might have been achieved had he lived.The film itself is carried on the shoulders of Sean Penn.  In his role as the charming gay leader, Penn so immerses himself into his character that it`s hard to believe you are not seeing Harvey himself.  Penn becomes that fiercely intelligent, cunning and profoundly human liberator with a great heart and voice for gay people everywhere.  Penn`s Milk is a man consumed by his mission. His lovers Scott (James Franco) and Paco (Diego Luna) are pushed aside by the relentless wheel of his mission.  The film does a fine job of showing the tragic personal costs Harvey has to pay for his success.  Yet, it is Milk`s own personal tragedy that the film so eloquently exposes.Some reviewers have taken issue with the film`s cinematic liberties, most significantly, the martyr-like presentation of Milk.  This is a valid criticism. Yet, one could argue that Milk was indeed an extravagant, theatrical character (like those of his beloved operas) who singularly brought about profound social change.  Milk was/is a larger than life figure in American social history and deserves to be portrayed as such.If the film stumbles a bit, it is with the portrayal of Milk`s colleague and assassin, city supervisor Dan White.  This weakness is no way lies with Josh Brolin`s performance of the troubled man, but rather with the screenplay itself.  This enigmatic persona is kept at a tantalizing distance from the focus of it all.  Alas, the film is called `Milk` and not `White,' for a reason.  Yet, Brolin masterfully captures White`s childish fascination and devotion to Milk, a fascination and devotion that could have been explored a bit deeper.  Was White a simple bigot, a tortured closet-case or just plain unprepared for the rapidly changing political climate of 1970`s America?Who should see this film?  Everybody.  As one wise reviewer remarked, `Milk' is at its heart an educational film, a film that can help further the goals of tolerance and justice that Harvey Milk so courageously lived and died for.

1190497,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B001FB55KI,B. Martin,"[2, 6]","Milk is one of those high minded, serious, ""issue"" movies that generally garner critical acclaim and rack up prizes during the awards season.  True to form, Gus Van Sandt's bio pic on the life of gay rights activist Harvey Milk received some of the year's best reviews and racked up a slew of oscar nominations including a trophy for Sean Penn's protrayal of the main character.  Yes, Milk is the thinking person's choice, the pick of the politically aware, socially responsible movie fan.  Of course that translates to:  the film is a bit of a bore.Van Sandt skillfully lays out the details of Harvey Milk's life and his battles to be elected to San Francisco's city council, which he eventually accomplished making him the first openly gay elected official in U.S. history.  The film stays close to the facts, rarely veering off course to explore the mental makeup of the man.  The movie is well crafted, smartly written, and extremely understanding and sensitive in the handling of its subject matter.  As for Penn's performance, he does an incredible job of impersonating Milk.  He captures the mannersims, charm and charisma of the man.  But it's mainly an impersonation.  Despite Penn's effortless acting, he never really embodies Milk.  We always feel like we are watching archived footage of the man (perhaps this is consistent with the docudrama feel of the film) but he never leaps off of the screen as a flesh and blood human being.  The end result makes the movie feel a bit distant and cool, like a subject being studied under a microscope.The bottom line is that while Milk is an intelligen, respectful and well made film, it never truly engages the emotions or excites in any real way.  Audiences, and the Academy, want to truly embrace a film if it's going to win a ton of prizes.  If you don't believe me, look no further than the film that was named best picture of 2008.

1190498,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001FB55KI,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 4]","MILK is one of those hot-button topics that divides our great country. The Evangelical Right sees it as their duty to dictate God's word here on Earth. The Leftists see any form of censorship or denying of rights as an affront to all things human and a threat to the Constitution. What's tough about this particular film is that it's a political minefield, rife with ideologues that want to press the issue of human rights. And why not. Many films have done this. But coming off the heals of Proposition 8 (California's ban on gay marriage) this subject is ready to boil over into a full-on war amongst the two opposing sides.The big question now is how to view this movie (and it is a movie, not a documentary) without blasting one side or the other, and thus falling into a political tirade. That's a challenge. And I've seen many film reviewers fail (Hell I might even fail! But I'm going to give it a shot anyway.)Harvey Milk (Sean Penn,Persepolis) moves to San Francisco's Castro District in early 1970 with lover Scott Smith (James Franco,Pineapple Express) and sets up a camera shop, where neighboring business men shun and threaten their gay lifestyle. Harvey, after witnessing the brutality of the local police force on gay men, decides to run for office. After three failed attempts and losing lover Scott, Harvey finally wins a seat as a city supervisor. Beside him is the down-on-his-luck supervisor Dan White (Josh Brolin,No Country for Old Men). The two squabble and eventually - as history tells us - White kills both Harvey Milk and Mayor Moscone (Victor Garber).Harvey Milk's ability to rally friends around him that were dedicated to the cause of bringing the gay lifestyle out of the closet was shown with exceptional care and grace (perhaps too much since I've read some of Milk's past and this film glorifies him as the ""Patron Saint of the Gays""). Without a doubt, Sean Penn deserved plenty of accolades and his Oscar win for Best Actor was both applauded by me and a bit of a letdown (I was rooting for Mickey Rourke inThe Wrestler). Still, I'm happy that Mr. Penn's performance got adequate notice. He really pulled off a stunner.Likewise, the supporting cast were amazing. I didn't even recognize Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild) as Cleve Jones! And Diego Luna's portrayal of the unbalanced Jack kept me uneasy about what he might do. Josh Brolin, of course, must get some notice as the failing Dan White. And Alison Pill as Anne Kronenberg was simply splendid.Director Gus Van Sant (My Own Private Idaho) did a great job of whisking us through Milk's early political failures and on to his successes. The incorporation of archival stock footage of the times added a surreal quality to the film, making it seem almost docu-drama in nature.Now, what to say about the politics of the film. It certainly wants you to empathize with the rights (or lack thereof) of gays in the U.S.. That is, after all, the message Harvey Milk was trying to get across. So if you're of the ""let no man lay down beside another man"" mentality, don't say you haven't been warned. This movie is about the life of one man who's entire existence was dedicated to giving equal rights to gays, so that's the message that gets spilled. But if you're in to great stories about interesting figures, this one will certainly please.",5,The Patron Saint of the Gay Community,1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,3319,"['MILK', 'one', 'hot-button', 'topics', 'great', 'country', 'Evangelical', 'Right', 'duty', 'dictate', 'God', 'word', 'here', 'Earth', 'Leftists', 'see', 'form', 'censorship', 'denying', 'rights', 'affront', 'things', 'human', 'threat', 'Constitution', 'What', 'tough', 'particular', 'film', 'political', 'minefield', 'rife', 'ideologues', 'want', 'press', 'issue', 'human', 'rights', 'why', 'not', 'Many', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'coming', 'off', 'heals', 'Proposition', '8', 'California', 'ban', 'gay', 'marriage', 'subject', 'ready', 'boil', 'over', 'full-on', 'war', 'two', 'opposing', 'sides.The', 'big', 'question', 'now', 'how', 'view', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'blasting', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'thus', 'falling', 'political', 'tirade', 'challenge', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'film', 'reviewers', 'fail', 'Hell', 'might', 'even', 'fail', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'shot', 'anyway', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Persepolis', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Castro', 'District', 'early', '1970', 'lover', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'James', 'Franco', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'up', 'camera', 'shop', 'where', 'neighboring', 'business', 'men', 'shun', 'threaten', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'Harvey', 'witnessing', 'brutality', 'local', 'police', 'force', 'gay', 'men', 'decides', 'run', 'office', 'three', 'failed', 'attempts', 'losing', 'lover', 'Scott', 'Harvey', 'finally', 'seat', 'city', 'supervisor', 'Beside', 'down-on-his-luck', 'supervisor', 'Dan', 'White', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'two', 'squabble', 'eventually', 'history', 'tells', 'White', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Mayor', 'Moscone', 'Victor', 'Garber', '.Harvey', 'Milk', 'ability', 'rally', 'friends', 'were', 'dedicated', 'cause', 'bringing', 'gay', 'closet', 'was', 'shown', 'exceptional', 'care', 'grace', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Milk', 'past', 'film', 'Patron', 'Saint', 'Gays', 'doubt', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'deserved', 'plenty', 'accolades', 'Oscar', 'win', 'Best', 'Actor', 'was', 'applauded', 'bit', 'letdown', 'was', 'rooting', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'inThe', 'Wrestler', 'Still', ""'m"", 'happy', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'performance', 'got', 'adequate', 'notice', 'really', 'pulled', 'off', 'stunner.Likewise', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'amazing', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Into', 'Wild', 'Cleve', 'Jones', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'portrayal', 'unbalanced', 'Jack', 'kept', 'uneasy', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'course', 'must', 'get', 'notice', 'failing', 'Dan', 'White', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'Anne', 'Kronenberg', 'was', 'simply', 'splendid.Director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Own', 'Private', 'Idaho', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'whisking', 'Milk', 'early', 'political', 'failures', 'successes', 'incorporation', 'archival', 'stock', 'footage', 'times', 'added', 'surreal', 'quality', 'film', 'making', 'seem', 'almost', 'docu-drama', 'nature.Now', 'what', 'say', 'politics', 'film', 'certainly', 'empathize', 'rights', 'lack', 'thereof', 'gays', 'U.S..', 'That', 'message', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'So', ""'re"", 'let', 'man', 'lay', 'down', 'beside', 'man', 'mentality', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'warned', 'movie', 'life', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'entire', 'existence', 'was', 'dedicated', 'giving', 'equal', 'rights', 'gays', 'message', 'spilled', ""'re"", 'great', 'stories', 'interesting', 'figures', 'one', 'will', 'certainly', 'please']",Milk

The ending is very sad, but his legacy opened the door for many homosexuals.  Specially, in the 70s when homosexuality was less tolerant.

1190504,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001FB55KI,Caleb Williams,"[0, 0]","In a previous review I coined Eagle Eye as one of the best of '08, well Milk isn't just one of the best, it is the #1 film of 2008. Sean Penn does it again and easily delivers one of his best performances bringing to life a character and a man we no longer have, and may never see again. This is a cast filled with genuine legends like Penn & Brolin, and up and coming megastars such as Emile Hirsch and James Franco. Each and every cast member seems to give it their all in keeping loyal to their played roles character in order to play an honest homage to this legendary figure. Gus Van Sant, is a relatively unknown Director and I'm hoping that this picture is one that makes him a household name.Personally, I'd never heard of Harvey Milk nor would have had any idea just who the man is, where he was from or what he stood for. When I heard about the film I thought nothing of it until I saw the trailer and then I was drawn in. Political activism is something I'm a strong believer in, I'm one for liberalism and the basic rights of man being upheld. I've always found it quite hypocritical that America, a country which swears allegiance to its constitution on a daily basis has such a history of prejudice and bigotry. You would think, looking at their constitution that politicians would fight to uphold its core values of ""all men be created equal"" rather than fight to rob certain minorities of their rights, but looking at Harvey Milks struggle and other struggles like it, I'm genuinely shocked.I would put Harvey Milk in the same league as such men like Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. They too were men who saw the persecution of their people and sought to put an end to it and fight for the core constitutional values to be upheld. Close to the end of Harveys life, America was going through a vote on Proposition 6. This was a vote which saw all homosexuals be removed from their jobs and focused its main attention on teachers. The reasoning behind this is that homosexuals recruit children to homosexuality and under ""gods law"" are simply ""immoral"". I've always been shocked by these claims by politicians and their justifications behind them are laughable, claims like this are even being made today but I'm glad to know that such prejudices aren't held in such wide regard as they once were. All history needs now is another champion for homosexuals that would have a bigger impact on the world stage.The film tells of the history making chapter in the story that is of American Gay Civil Rights. Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man elected to a public office in the entire United States history and possibly the first in the world. The film is set during Harveys mid 40s when he first moves to San Francisco with his partner Scott Smith (James Franco). The heterosexual community don't agree with Harvey and Scott setting up business in the neighbourhood and try to make it difficult for them. Because of this Harvey decides to become an activists and increases the gay presence within the neighbourhood which force those companies who tried to make it hard for him out of business.Over time, Harvey starts to realise that in order to truly stop the persecution by police and other bigotted residents Harvey must run for Supervisor of District 5. He knows it will be a difficult fight but he knows that it's the only way to truly make a difference for the gay community. The first 4 years he runs for the office, he's met with disappointing defeat yet every year he's defeated by a less and less margin until in the 5th year he manages to pull off the win and makes history. During his time in office, he finds a conflict with fellow supervisor but of district 8, Dan White. Harvey first wants Whites support in order to win votes, but due to a few conflicts Dan ends up being Harveys biggest opponent.I think telling you more about the story would give the whole thing away, so I'll leave it there. What I want to say about this film simply can't be expressed in words. The only way I can put across my love and appreciation of this picture is to simply recommend it to the masses. It's incredible, one of the best things you'll see this year if not ever and even if this doesn't get massive worldwide advertising campaign, it's a film that will go down as a favourite amongst many. This film has also won my love thanks to the excellent acting by Emile Hirsch, I've always been a fan and is one of the reasons I chose to watch this.Go see it, buy it or just get on a plane and watch it on your trip, but the message is loud and clear, SEE THIS MOVIE.",5,Powerful,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,4580,"['previous', 'review', 'coined', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'one', 'best', ""'08"", 'well', 'Milk', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'best', '1', 'film', '2008', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'again', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'bringing', 'life', 'character', 'man', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'cast', 'filled', 'genuine', 'legends', 'Penn', 'Brolin', 'up', 'coming', 'megastars', 'such', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'James', 'Franco', 'cast', 'member', 'give', 'keeping', 'loyal', 'played', 'roles', 'character', 'order', 'play', 'honest', 'homage', 'legendary', 'figure', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Director', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'picture', 'one', 'household', 'name.Personally', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'idea', 'just', 'who', 'man', 'where', 'was', 'what', 'stood', 'When', 'heard', 'film', 'thought', 'nothing', 'saw', 'trailer', 'then', 'was', 'drawn', 'Political', 'activism', 'something', ""'m"", 'strong', 'believer', ""'m"", 'one', 'liberalism', 'basic', 'rights', 'man', 'being', 'upheld', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'quite', 'hypocritical', 'America', 'country', 'allegiance', 'constitution', 'daily', 'basis', 'history', 'prejudice', 'bigotry', 'would', 'think', 'looking', 'constitution', 'politicians', 'would', 'fight', 'uphold', 'core', 'values', 'men', 'be', 'created', 'equal', 'rather', 'fight', 'rob', 'certain', 'minorities', 'rights', 'looking', 'Harvey', 'Milks', 'struggle', 'other', 'struggles', ""'m"", 'genuinely', 'shocked.I', 'would', 'put', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'same', 'league', 'such', 'men', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'too', 'were', 'men', 'who', 'saw', 'persecution', 'people', 'sought', 'put', 'end', 'fight', 'core', 'constitutional', 'values', 'be', 'upheld', 'Close', 'end', 'Harveys', 'life', 'America', 'was', 'going', 'vote', 'Proposition', '6', 'was', 'vote', 'saw', 'homosexuals', 'be', 'removed', 'jobs', 'focused', 'main', 'attention', 'teachers', 'reasoning', 'homosexuals', 'recruit', 'children', 'homosexuality', 'gods', 'law', 'are', 'simply', 'immoral', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'shocked', 'claims', 'politicians', 'justifications', 'are', 'laughable', 'claims', 'are', 'even', 'being', 'made', 'today', ""'m"", 'glad', 'know', 'such', 'prejudices', 'are', ""n't"", 'held', 'such', 'wide', 'regard', 'once', 'were', 'history', 'needs', 'now', 'champion', 'homosexuals', 'would', 'have', 'bigger', 'impact', 'world', 'stage.The', 'film', 'tells', 'history', 'making', 'chapter', 'story', 'American', 'Gay', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'was', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'elected', 'public', 'office', 'entire', 'United', 'States', 'history', 'possibly', 'first', 'world', 'film', 'set', 'Harveys', 'mid', '40s', 'when', 'first', 'San', 'Francisco', 'partner', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'James', 'Franco', 'heterosexual', 'community', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Harvey', 'Scott', 'setting', 'up', 'business', 'neighbourhood', 'try', 'make', 'difficult', 'Harvey', 'become', 'activists', 'gay', 'presence', 'neighbourhood', 'force', 'companies', 'who', 'tried', 'make', 'hard', 'business.Over', 'time', 'Harvey', 'realise', 'order', 'truly', 'stop', 'persecution', 'police', 'other', 'bigotted', 'residents', 'Harvey', 'must', 'run', 'Supervisor', 'District', '5', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'fight', 'only', 'way', 'truly', 'make', 'difference', 'gay', 'community', 'first', '4', 'years', 'office', 'met', 'disappointing', 'defeat', 'yet', 'year', 'defeated', 'less', 'less', 'margin', '5th', 'year', 'pull', 'off', 'win', 'history', 'time', 'office', 'conflict', 'fellow', 'supervisor', 'district', '8', 'Dan', 'White', 'Harvey', 'first', 'support', 'order', 'win', 'votes', 'due', 'few', 'conflicts', 'Dan', 'up', 'being', 'Harveys', 'biggest', 'opponent.I', 'think', 'telling', 'more', 'story', 'would', 'give', 'whole', 'thing', 'away', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'there', 'What', 'want', 'say', 'film', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'expressed', 'words', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'put', 'love', 'appreciation', 'picture', 'simply', 'recommend', 'masses', 'incredible', 'one', 'best', 'things', ""'ll"", 'see', 'year', 'not', 'ever', 'even', ""n't"", 'get', 'massive', 'worldwide', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'favourite', 'amongst', 'many', 'film', 'also', 'won', 'love', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'one', 'reasons', 'chose', 'watch', 'this.Go', 'see', 'buy', 'just', 'get', 'plane', 'watch', 'trip', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'SEE', 'THIS', 'MOVIE']",Milk

He is also given great competition by Josh Brolin playing Dan White. Directed by Gus Van Sant, this film is the biography of Harvey Milk, a gay rights activist decades ago in San Francisco, who rose to considerable political power.  Milk and the mayor of San Francisco were assassinated by Dan White, a conservative straight man who was also on the board of supervisors along with Harvey.  I couldn't help compare this film with the documentary made about Milk in 1984, ""The Times of Harvey Milk."" The problem is that the film does the same job as the documentary.  It covers in literal and linear fashion, the ascendance and destruction of Harvey Milk.  The film does not try anything new and visionary in telling a biography like Oliver Stone did with ""The Doors.""  Still, Van Sant does nothing wrong telling the tale and also has first class actors to play the tale.  One thing the film does convey is the hope that Harvey Milk brought to gay people for gay rights in this country.  It seems in retrospect a lot more innocent time for gays, a time when there was hope for coming out and being accepted in the not so distant future.  One cannot say that about present day.

B Collins Jr.,"[1, 2]","This film is just exceptional, accomplishing the difficult task of teaching social history without preaching, of exploring character and courage from a perspective of lived reality, and communicating to gay audiences the historic struggles of the gay rights movement while communicating to straight audiences the motivations that moved the gay rights movement forward.  The cast is superb, with Sean Penn offering a perfect performance of power and grace, humor and courage. James Franco does a wonderful understated calm performance as Scott Smith, the lover who follows Harvey to San Francisco and emotionally supports him during his rocky rise in the local political scene. Gus Van Sant may have been the perfect director for this script since he is sensitive to the subtle dynamics and evolution of the gay rights movement while also making a credible effort to explore the character of Harvey Milk and his lovers. The film reminds us of the terrible violence and discrimination those in the gay community experienced from the police, media, and courts.  This reference back to these days of harassment and attacks is important in grounding the work and philosophy of Harvey Milk. Placing this story within the history of the Castro neighborhood in San Francisco helps give the narrative a time and place as well as makes reference to a major social movement. The historic films, including the films of Anita Bryant's bigoted campaign against gay men and women, give all viewers a feel for the hatred, bigotry, violence, discrimination, and lack of civil rights that gay men and women experienced. The film is very educational in that it firmly places gay rights as in the same group with civil rights for African Americans and women. Yet Harvey Milk is a critical piece of this history, not just as an activist but also as the first open gay person elected to public office in the United States. Harvey Milk is fully characterized as a multi-dimensional, resilient, courageous, transcendent human being. His resiliency, as portrayed by Sean Penn, is inspiring. Milk had a broad and objective view of the condition of gay men and women in the United States and the political skills to move forward in the fight against discrimination. He loses a handsome young lover in his political fights and then adopts a damaged soul as his second lover. It is the loving, protective way that Harvey loves and supports his emotionally and mentally fragile lover that echoes his love and protection for all of those in the gay movement.  In other words, Harvey was willing to take a partner who was damaged goods, and in so doing, personifies his philosophy that the gay community is full of persons who are damaged and deserve protection. Harvey loses three consecutive elections but finally with his vision and resiliency, he prevails and is elected to the San Francisco board of supervisors.  The rise and tragic fall of Harvey Milk makes for wonderfully moving drama, even more penetrating, because it reflects a significant time in our history.",5,Courage and integrity of the highest order,1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,3040,"['film', 'just', 'exceptional', 'accomplishing', 'difficult', 'task', 'teaching', 'social', 'history', 'preaching', 'exploring', 'character', 'courage', 'perspective', 'lived', 'reality', 'communicating', 'gay', 'audiences', 'historic', 'struggles', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'communicating', 'straight', 'audiences', 'motivations', 'moved', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'forward', 'cast', 'superb', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'offering', 'perfect', 'performance', 'power', 'grace', 'humor', 'courage', 'James', 'Franco', 'wonderful', 'understated', 'calm', 'performance', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'lover', 'who', 'Harvey', 'San', 'Francisco', 'emotionally', 'rocky', 'rise', 'local', 'political', 'scene', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'director', 'script', 'sensitive', 'subtle', 'dynamics', 'evolution', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'also', 'making', 'credible', 'effort', 'explore', 'character', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'lovers', 'film', 'terrible', 'violence', 'discrimination', 'gay', 'community', 'experienced', 'police', 'media', 'courts', 'reference', 'back', 'days', 'harassment', 'attacks', 'important', 'grounding', 'work', 'philosophy', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Placing', 'story', 'history', 'Castro', 'neighborhood', 'San', 'Francisco', 'give', 'narrative', 'time', 'place', 'as', 'well', 'reference', 'major', 'social', 'movement', 'historic', 'films', 'including', 'films', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'bigoted', 'campaign', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'give', 'viewers', 'feel', 'hatred', 'bigotry', 'violence', 'discrimination', 'lack', 'civil', 'rights', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'experienced', 'film', 'very', 'educational', 'firmly', 'gay', 'rights', 'same', 'group', 'civil', 'rights', 'African', 'Americans', 'women', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'critical', 'piece', 'history', 'not', 'just', 'activist', 'also', 'first', 'open', 'gay', 'person', 'elected', 'public', 'office', 'United', 'States', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'fully', 'characterized', 'multi-dimensional', 'resilient', 'courageous', 'transcendent', 'human', 'being', 'resiliency', 'portrayed', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'inspiring', 'Milk', 'had', 'broad', 'objective', 'view', 'condition', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'United', 'States', 'political', 'skills', 'move', 'forward', 'fight', 'discrimination', 'handsome', 'young', 'lover', 'political', 'fights', 'then', 'damaged', 'soul', 'second', 'lover', 'loving', 'protective', 'way', 'Harvey', 'loves', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'fragile', 'lover', 'love', 'protection', 'gay', 'movement', 'other', 'words', 'Harvey', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'partner', 'who', 'was', 'damaged', 'goods', 'so', 'doing', 'philosophy', 'gay', 'community', 'full', 'persons', 'who', 'are', 'damaged', 'deserve', 'protection', 'Harvey', 'three', 'consecutive', 'elections', 'finally', 'vision', 'resiliency', 'elected', 'San', 'Francisco', 'board', 'supervisors', 'rise', 'tragic', 'fall', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'wonderfully', 'moving', 'drama', 'even', 'more', 'penetrating', 'significant', 'time', 'history']",Milk

He was truly an inspiration to all who have fallen victims to prejudice and discrimination, solely because of their sexuality.This movie was very moving and even though I told myself not to cry, the tears just flowed out of me after the film.

Milk's camera shop soon becomes ground zero for the Castro district's gay community and Milk begins running for political office in San Francisco. After several failed attempts, he wins a seat on the Board of City Supervisors, gaining notoriety as America's first openly gay elected official. Unfortunately, Milk finds an enemy in conservative, and criminally deranged, politician Dan White and the life of the trailblazing Milk ends in tragedy.I'm the sort of movie fan who usually pays more attention to the quality of the script than the acting. But in this film it is impossible not to be impressed by Penn's incredibly dynamic performance. He really does BECOME Harvey Milk and all but the most staunch homophobes will find themselves rooting for him (and even they might secretly like him). But this isn't just a simple minded glorification of the man. Instead it shows many sides of Milk, including his egotism, manipulative behavior and a weakness for younger men that some viewers will be uncomfortable with.

1190511,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001FB55KI,Chris Pandolfi,"[24, 31]","At this point, I think it's safe to say that we can all depend on Sean Penn. What an amazingly versatile actor, gifted with the ability to transform himself into virtually anyone from virtually any background. Even the God-awful 2006 remake of ""All the King's Men"" was made better by his portrayal of Willie Stark. He shines once again in Gus Van Sant's ""Milk,"" a film that chronicles the final years of Harvey Milk, who became the first openly gay man to be elected into public office in California. Before his assassination in 1978, he managed to become a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and was the driving force behind a number of demonstrations that challenged many anti-gay initiatives. His story could not be more perfectly timed; I live in California, where, in the last election, a proposition to ban same-sex marriage (Prop 8) was put on the ballot. I'm sorry to say that it passed (although, as of the date of this writing, the ruling is being challenged in California's Supreme Court).But social and political commentaries aren't the sum of the film's parts. ""Milk"" is a rich, enlightening character study, probing deeply into the minds of very different people. This brings me back to Sean Penn, who certainly had his work cut out for him as the title character. As an activist, Milk was such a unique personality--outrageous, bold, and even a bit theatrical, yet refreshingly earnest and straightforward at the same time. His beginnings, on the other hand, were much more conservative, and he kept it that way throughout most of his adult life. The story proper begins in 1970 on the eve of his fortieth birthday, at which point he's an insurance statistician in New York City. On the steps of a deserted subway station, he meets Scott Smith (James Franco). The two quickly become lovers, move to San Francisco, and open a camera shop in the Castro district.And yet, something is missing for Milk. ""I'm forty years old,"" he observes, ""and I haven't done a thing I'm proud of."" Tired of guarding his sexuality and sick of the way law enforcement has been handling hate crimes, he soon establishes himself as a community activist, advocating equality for all. It isn't long before his political ambitions grow, and by 1975, he was ready to cut his hair, abstain from marijuana, and seriously pursue a position in city government. Three all-consuming, unsuccessful campaigns drive a wedge between Milk and Smith; by the time Milk is finally elected as a representative for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, their relationship cools to a mere friendship. At this point, Milk has recruited Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), a young activist, and Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill), a lesbian campaign manager. They do whatever they can to rally supporters, especially now that Milk is trying to pass a city ordinance that would protect people--many of them teachers--from being fired because of their sexual orientation. He faces an uphill battle with the Christian Right, specifically Senator John Briggs (Denis O'Hare) and singer/former orange juice spokeswoman Anita Bryant (seen only in actual archival news footage).He faces a battle of a different kind with Dan White (Josh Brolin), a Board Supervisor Milk suspects of being a closeted homosexual, despite his staunch anti-gay stance. Indeed, there's something both odd and desperate about White's behavior towards Milk, inviting him to his son's christening, showing up at Milk's birthday party drunk and shouting that he's got issues too. As White grows more and more resentful of Milk and his inner circle of political allies--specifically Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garbor)--we see less of a political figure and more of a man on the brink of emotional collapse.There's a fascinating association between the film's political message and Van Sant's cinematic creativity. A few select moments are true narrative masterstrokes, and they each involve quiet yet profound reflections in shiny objects. One of the earliest takes place early in Milk's political career, at which point gays in San Francisco were issued whistles; when Milk arrives at the crime scene of a murdered young man, his conversation with a police officer is shown entirely as a reflection off of a blood stained whistle. Another moment takes place much later on in White's living room, after Milk had established himself as a prominent politician. White's television set displays Milk in the middle of a news interview; we see White's reflection in the bottom left corner of the screen, and while we don't know what he's thinking, we do know that he's interested in what Milk is saying.One of the most striking subplots involves Milk and his new lover, Jack Lira (Diego Luna), who quickly proves that he's ill-equipped to handle Milk's rising political clout. He's painfully insecure, and it only gets worse as Milk's schedule goes from heavy to full. Lira clings to Milk like a frightened animal, which is understandable but also pathetic. The real sorrow comes from the fact that Milk was too busy fighting a good fight to take any notice. What if he didn't have anything to fight against? What if there was no discrimination? ""Milk"" will no doubt inspire many people, but it's also likely to infuriate many others. If you're like me, then you might feel a little bit of both. Why are we still at a point where equality has to be fought for? Are we not in the twenty-first century? Shouldn't we have gotten over this issue a long time ago? It's sad to leave a movie theater and realize that not much has changed in thirty years.",5,He's Here to Recruit You,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,5588,"['point', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'can',

1190512,AN9J46667D80O,B001FB55KI,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[2, 3]","What an amazing movie this was! Not just as a great example of gay cinema done right, though it certainly is that. No, it stands on its own as a movie showing the portrait of a man who didn't intend to become political, wound up doing so, and ended up paying the ultimate price.The film tells the story of Milk and his boyfriend (James Franco), moving to San Francisco and promptly running into the kind of evil prejudice against gays that one would these days expect to see only at a CPAC meeting. This energizes and angers him to the point where he starts to get involved and begins his efforts to run for office. Initially his biggest enemies are the other prominent gays, but soon he's able to overcome and get elected, right in time to start a major fight with Anita Bryant and her crowd.Sadly his promising political career is cut short as another member of the San Francisco government guns down Milk and the mayor. He later plead not-guilty due to reasons of insanity, using the famous ""Twinkie Defense"", but it's pretty clear from what we see here that, no, he wasn't nuts; just another bigot who couldn't stand the gays and was really ticked when one of them, Milk, broke a political promise to him.Sean Penn gives the performance of his career as gay activist/politician Harvey Milk. He completely disappears into the role. At no point was I ""aware"" that I was just watching someone act, as often happens with films. No, he is extremely convincing and does an incredible job worthy of the Best Actor award he received for the role.The writing and directing are quite effective as well. This is the sort of movie that could've very quickly wound up being nothing more than a preachy screed in favor of gay rights, but thankfully it instead is something far more entertaining and interesting.Further I, as someone who is bisexual, gained new appreciation for the gay rights movement. I'm too young to remember what it was like during the 1970's for gays, but from this movie I now have an inkling, and I'm glad there were people like Milk who were around to fight against the monsters like Bryant and her bunch.

1190513,A35FC3DWA1M79H,B001FB55KI,Christopher,"[2, 16]","Let me start off by saying that this film is actually good!  It is well directed and brilliantly acted.  Sean Penn is either a brilliant actor or there are some questions we have to ask him!First, the actors are very brave to kiss each other no matter the pay.  I know it is concerning gay individuals, so gay activity must be expressed in some way, bu if I were an actor, I would have used a stand-in.The actors stayed in gay character throughout the film and most were not overdone, but on point.  There were plenty of attempts to show gay sex and gay love (if there is such a thing) as normal, but you can never see it since we know it is not natural.  I am still surprised that the actors took it as far as they did.  I am sure the director convinced them to do it so that the audience could be at ease with gayness.The directing was good and for this type of film, it flowed well.  From the film, we get the sense that Milk was not about politics, but about the politics of gayness and forcing society to accept it a any cost.  While gays do a good job of coming together (no pun), they need to come together with normal society for the betterment of MAN - not gay sex.With that said, this film was part biography and mostly gay propaganda of the type we have been seeing foced upon us en masse since the mid-1990's with talk shows such as Rickie Lake and Springer.  TV personalities were instructed to not say anything negative about gays even though their actions are negative.Aside from telling the story, it was filled with a bunch of propaganda to brainwash the viewer into feeling for the gay movement (no pun).  The film was less about Milk's election or death, but mainly about gays in America.  This detracts from the film as a whole.Great film, but if they could make the film about his life from his perspective without the propaganda, I would rate it higher.",3,Gay Propaganda for the 2000 Era Hollywood!,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,1875,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'film', 'actually', 'good', 'well', 'directed', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'are', 'questions', 'have', 'ask', 'First', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'brave', 'kiss', 'other', 'matter', 'pay', 'know', 'concerning', 'gay', 'individuals', 'so', 'gay', 'activity', 'must', 'be', 'expressed', 'way', 'were', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'stand-in.The', 'actors', 'stayed', 'gay', 'character', 'film', 'most', 'were', 'not', 'overdone', 'point', 'were', 'plenty', 'attempts', 'show', 'gay', 'sex', 'gay', 'love', 'such', 'thing', 'normal', 'can', 'never', 'see', 'know', 'not', 'natural', 'am', 'still', 'surprised', 'actors', 'took', 'as', 'far', 'did', 'am', 'sure', 'director', 'convinced', 'do', 'so', 'audience', 'could', 'be', 'ease', 'gayness.The', 'directing', 'was', 'good', 'type', 'film', 'flowed', 'well', 'film', 'get', 'sense', 'Milk', 'was', 'not', 'politics', 'politics', 'gayness', 'forcing', 'society', 'accept', 'cost', 'gays', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'coming', 'together', 'pun', 'need', 'come', 'together', 'normal', 'society', 'betterment', 'MAN', 'not', 'gay', 'sex.With', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'part', 'biography', 'mostly', 'gay', 'propaganda', 'type', 'have', 'been', 'seeing', 'foced', 'en', 'masse', 'mid-1990', 'talk', 'shows', 'such', 'Rickie', 'Lake', 'Springer', 'TV', 'personalities', 'were', 'instructed', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'negative', 'gays', 'even', 'actions', 'are', 'negative.Aside', 'telling', 'story', 'was', 'filled', 'bunch', 'propaganda', 'brainwash', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'gay', 'movement', 'pun', 'film', 'was', 'less', 'Milk', 'election', 'death', 'mainly', 'gays', 'America', 'film', 'whole.Great', 'film', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'life', 'perspective', 'propaganda', 'would', 'rate', 'higher']",Milk

overinflated...i left the theater a believer.Sean Penn does a phenomenal job and i've never seen Penn embrace or embody the spirit of a character with such authority and compelling intensity as he did in milk.Penn did not act as Milk but was Harvey Milk.As for Harvey Milk, well you get a glimpse into his personal life as well as his rise into the political spotlight leading into the assasination of this most courageous individual who fought for the rights of his community through extreme adversity.What spurred his political interest was seeing all the beatings and hate killings with none or hardly any penalties being applied because the victims happened to be gay.In the end, it was about murder and injustice to human beings.Penns astonishing performance is accompanied by a steller cast completely involved and inspired in their parts with James Franco as his first campaign manager and lover and Emile Hirsch portraying his political right hand man and quite an effective ally in the campaign to get Milk elected to politcal officeDiego Luna who's made such impresive and risque performances in such movies as y tu mama tambien impresses again here with a sensitive memorable portrayel of Milks extremely final unstable lover.Josh Brolin also turns in a great performance as supervisor Dan White showing all the complexities of this character leading up to a chilling climactic final scene.It's a joy to see how much Brolin has grown as an actor and he displays here a range and depth that are quite compelling.Finally we arrive to the script writer (Dustin Black) and the director Gus Van Sant.First i will say that the script is excellant with a dialogue and story writng that never loses its momentum and keeps you engaged from minute one to the end.It helps that you have such a fine cast to make it happen but the script went hand in hand to make such a wonderful movie.Gus Van Sant to me i felt was very detailed and seemed to really care about giving us the facts about this historical figure with footage from that time including Anita O' Bryant's famous interviews and speeches as well as footage from the Castro neighborhood back in the 70's and news reports featuring Walter Cronkite.Newspaper articles from that time were also featured and at the end of the movie you get to see actual pictures of the real people who were part of the Milk campaign.You can see the love and dedication that Gus Van Sant put into this film and in the end it paid off.The end result is a magnificent film and an instant classic.Not something that happens too

The fact Milk promoted a medically proven unhealthy and risky lifestyle relentlessly, demonstrates liberal hypocrisy at that time-place.Sean Penn has been an 'A' list actor making almost anything he is in gripping and fascinating. He is the only reason the film gets one star.A film about standing up for behavior you believe in is fine ... unless what that behavior has been known to be immoral by virtually every society and religion. As the saying goes, sometimes Bad is BAD!The movie ignores that Milk was friends with and gave endorsements to psycho cult leader Jim Jones who murdered over 900 people at Jonestown. Another close friend of Milk's, Gerard Dols, nowadays laments the behavior of Milk and his obsession with gay agendas. Google his testimony. Milk accomplished next to nothing for mainstream voters in California. Instead he spent his career selfishly pushing his sexual agenda.He was not murdered for being gay, but got in the way of a mentally ill ex-employee, yet the homosexual community looks for every opportunity for self-promoting themselves. You don't glorify someone for their sex practices and how proud they are of them. The movies acceptance and promotion of the dangerous homosexual lifestyle which has already cost Americans billions in health care for various diseases-treatments-experiments.

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[0, 1]","how a homophobic killer just about got offImportant film for all of us to see once more if only to remember Mr. Milk and his martyrdom and the hands of a deranged ideological, irreligious assassin whose defense was characterized later as having consumed a surfeit of Twinkies, a now rarely seen but once popular snack food consisting of yellow cake (not uranium as now) filled with a creamy white filling, an oddly phallic symbol to associate with this homophobic murderer.Perhaps good old Wikipedia has the best summary of this Twinkie Defense term, and of events surrounding the trial important for anyone who may see this film, including the fall-out for the old legal term ""diminished capacity."" Oddly California voters decide a good deal of public policy, from micro-managing teaching strategies in the schools (and thus eliminating the most effective Bilingual methodology) to choosing which terms may be used at trial. In any case this article also show how the perpetrator of this homicide receives a whole lot of outside help, from the police (being a former officer) and several for-hire psychiatrists. To quote:""The expression derives from the 1979 trial of Dan White, a former San Francisco, California (U.S.) Supervisor who assassinated Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, on November 27, 1978. At the trial, noted psychiatrist Martin Blinder testified that White had been depressed at the time of the crime, and pointed to several factors indicating White's depression: he had quit his job; he shunned his wife; and although normally clean-cut, he had become slovenly in appearance. Furthermore, White had previously been a fitness fanatic and health food advocate, but had begun consuming junk food and sugar-laden soft drinks like Coca-Cola. As an incidental note, Blinder mentioned theories that elements of diet could worsen existing mood swings.[2] Another psychiatrist, George Solomon, testified that White had ""exploded"" and was ""sort of on automatic pilot"" at the time of the killings.[3] The fact that White had killed Moscone and Milk was notchallenged, but -- in part because of the testimony from Blinder and other psychiatrists -- the defense successfully persuaded the jury that White's capacity for rational thought had been diminished; the jurors found White incapable of the premeditation required for a murder conviction, and instead convicted him of voluntary manslaughter. Public protests over the verdict led to the White Night Riots.Ironically, Twinkies themselves were never mentioned in the courtroom. But Twinkies did prove an effective target for derision from those who found the argument unacceptable. In stories covering the trial, satirist Paul Krassner had played up the angle of the Twinkie,[2] and he would later claim credit for coining the term ""Twinkie defense"".[4] The day after the verdict, columnist Herb Caen wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle about the police support for White (a former policeman himself) and their ""dislike (understatement) of homosexuals"" and mentioned ""the Twinkie insanity defense"" in passing.[2] News stories published after the trial, however, frequently reported the defense arguments inaccurately, claiming that the defense had presented junk food as the cause of White's depression and/or diminished capacity, instead of being symptomatic of (and perhaps exacerbating) an existing depression.[5]As a result of the White case, the term, ""diminished capacity,"" was abolished in 1982 by Proposition 8 and the California legislature and was replaced by the term, ""diminished actuality,"" referring not to the capacity to have a specific intent, but to whether the defendant actually had the required intent to commit the crime with which he or she was charged.[6] Additionally, California's statutory definitions of premeditation and malice required for murder were eliminated by the state's legislature, with the return to common law definitions. By this time the, ""Twinkie defense,"" had become such a common referent that one lawmaker had waved a Twinkie in the air while making his point during a debate.[2]""People interested in the history of this courageous man, Mr. Milk, may read such books asThe Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk (Stonewall Inn Editions)andGayslayer!

1190519,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B001FB55KI,DanD,"[2, 4]","Gus Van Sant's MILK is a phenomenal film.  It chronicles the career of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician, and his struggle and triumph against bigotry.  The script, by Dustin Lance Black, is one of the best in recent years; Black earned his Oscar and all the acclaim he's garnered.  Van Sant's directing is something to behold; the film is a seamless flow of ""archival"" footage and ""new"" footage, interlaced to tell the story of the struggle.It is the acting, though, that really ropes in the viewer.  Sean Penn won a Best Acting Oscar for his portrayal of Milk, and he earned it; he sinks into his role, disappearing behind Milk's persona, creating an iconic film character, a modern day Atticus Finch.  Josh Brolin, as Milk's political adversary (and eventual assassin) Dan White, turns in another great performance; he exudes a sense of unease and self-loathing, and would surely have been a shoe-in for Best Supporting Actor had it not been for the late Heath Ledger's iconic performance in THE DARK KNIGHT.  James Franco shows yet again that he is a genuine talent; following a string of second- and third- rate roles, he showed his talent in PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, and now here again, in a moving, powerful performance.  The other primary supporting roles--from Emile Hirsch, Alison Pill, and Diego Luna specifically--are all well cast.MILK is a movie for our times.  It is powerful, persuasive, emotional, funny, romantic, and entertaining; in other words, it's everything a film could hope to be. Watch it and be moved.

It is an eye-opening look back to a time not that long ago, but which now seems like light years ago in terms of the rapidly advancing progress made by courageous successors to Milk in the equal rights struggle for LGBT Americans.A Great cast led by the amazing Sean Penn, who won the best actor Academy Award for this moving performance. A second Oscar was won by Lance Black for his original screenplay; his Oscar acceptance speech was notable and emotional and should be still up on youtube. It would have been a nice touch if both Penn's and Black's Oscar speeches were included as DVD extras, but the DVD extras that ARE here are very, very good and a nice extra bonus. (The film was nominated for at least another half dozen categories.)In short, a &#34;must-see&#34; for all who are either LGBT or their friends/family, and any or all who are interested in learning about American social history of the 1970's and the struggle for equal rights which was by no means an easy climb up a very steep hill.

Through all of this, Gus Van Sant's film remains warm and intimate so that we never lose sight that at the heart of this movement were real, feeling, fallible, uncertain, often frightened human beings who rose to the challenge of insisting on their humanity in the face of overwhelming condemnation and persecution.  Much of the credit for this successful presentation goes to Sean Penn and the rest of the wonderful cast, notably including James Franco and Emile Hirch.  Screenwriter Dustin Lance Black also deserves praise.Like another recent film, ""The Wrestler,"" much of its interest comes from the vivid depiction of its milieu, a world that will be very unfamiliar to most viewers--in this case, the evolution of San Francisco's Castro Street area into something like a gay Zion.

1190524,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B001FB55KI,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[1, 2]","Watching ""Milk,"" with its historical footage mixed with acted scenes, made me realize just how far we've come since the 1970s and 1980s regarding gay rights and tolerance.  Director Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black provide this context through their telling of the life of Harvey Milk, a gay man who moved to the Castro in San Francisco during the time when its gay population was first exploding.  Even viewers not familiar with Milk's story will know within the first few minutes that Milk will be killed; however, the suspense in this film is not how that will happen, but how Milk will manage to transcend it through his decade of activism.Sean Penn plays Milk so convincingly and lovingly that it's easy to forget that the role is acted.  Penn's Milk is never stereotyped and instead comes across as a passionate, courageous man who has decided that he has no choice but to fight.  Other standout performances include James Franco as Scott, Milk's true love; Diego Luna (Y Tu Mama Tambien) as wacko, flamboyant, needy Jack;  Josh Brolin as repressed and lonely Dan White;  Emile Hirsch, as Cleve Jones; and Alison Pill, as Anne Kronenberg.  Anita Bryant, in news clips that seem laughable today, comes across as a dangerous force of her time.Although both gays and lesbians continue to face obstacles on a daily basis, this film drives home just how difficult it was in the years following the otherwise liberating sixties and seventies.  The characters in ""Milk"" yearn to be treated like equal members of society, and their actors imbibe them with such humanity that I would be surprised if their performances don't open a few eyes.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",5,An eye-opening account of the early Gay Rights Movement,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,1678,"['Watching', 'Milk', 'historical', 'footage', 'mixed', 'acted', 'scenes', 'made', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', '1970s', '1980s', 'regarding', 'gay', 'rights', 'tolerance', 'Director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'screenwriter', 'Dustin', 'Lance', 'Black', 'provide', 'context', 'telling', 'life', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'moved', 'Castro', 'San', 'Francisco', 'time', 'when', 'gay', 'population', 'was', 'first', 'exploding', 'Even', 'viewers', 'not', 'familiar', 'Milk', 'story', 'will', 'know', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Milk', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'however', 'suspense', 'film', 'not', 'how', 'will', 'happen', 'how', 'Milk', 'will', 'manage', 'transcend', 'decade', 'activism.Sean', 'Penn', 'Milk', 'so', 'convincingly', 'lovingly', 'easy', 'forget', 'role', 'acted', 'Penn', 'Milk', 'never', 'stereotyped', 'instead', 'across', 'passionate', 'courageous', 'man', 'who', 'decided', 'choice', 'fight', 'Other', 'standout', 'performances', 'include', 'James', 'Franco', 'Scott', 'Milk', 'true', 'love', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mama', 'Tambien', 'wacko', 'flamboyant', 'needy', 'Jack', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'repressed', 'lonely', 'Dan', 'White', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Cleve', 'Jones', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'Anne', 'Kronenberg', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'news', 'clips', 'seem', 'laughable', 'today', 'across', 'dangerous', 'force', 'time.Although', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'continue', 'face', 'obstacles', 'daily', 'basis', 'film', 'home', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'years', 'following', 'otherwise', 'liberating', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'characters', 'Milk', 'yearn', 'be', 'treated', 'equal', 'members', 'society', 'actors', 'imbibe', 'such', 'humanity', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'open', 'few', 'eyes.', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",Milk

Amith (kndy),"[3, 5]","In 2009, the film ""MILK"" based on the powerful and inspirational story of San Francisco's Harvey Milk, a man who fought for human rights won the hearts of critics who raved that the film is one of the year's best.The film went on to receive eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay. The result was Sean Penn winning ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role"" and Dustin Lance Black (""Big Love"", ""The Journey of Jared Price"" and ""Something Close to Heaven"") winning ""Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen"".The film was directed by Gus Van Sant (""Good will Hunting"", ""Psycho"" and ""Finding Forrester""), music composed by award winning composer Danny Elfman (""Terminator Salvation"", ""Batman"", ""Spider-Man"", etc.) and cinematography by Harris Savides (""Zodiac"", ""Finding Forrester"" and ""American Gangster"").The film would be known for its talented cast which include Judd Hirsch (""Taking Woodstock"", ""Speed Racer"", ""Lords of Dogtown""), Josh Brolin (""W."", ""American Gangster"" and ""No Country for Old Men""), James Franco (""Spiderman"" films, ""Pineapple Express"" and ""Nights in Rodanthe""), Victor Garber (""Eli Stone"" and ""Alias""), Dennis O'Hare (""Brothers & Sisters"", ""The Proposal"" and ""Quarantine""), Lucas Grabeel (""High School Musical"" films), Joseph Cross (""Smallville"", ""Untraceable"" and ""Flags of Our Fathers"") and many more.The film is about Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), the first openly gay man to be elected to public office. The film details the life of Harvey Milk living in New York and moving to San Francisco in 1972 with his boyfriend Scott Smith (James Franco) in the Castro District. During that time, there was political unrest as homosexuals were being beaten and killed and one man decided to make a difference and inspire thousands to also stand up for themselves.""MILK"" gives us a glimpse of the life Harvey Milk had. From running for political office (unsuccessfully) three times but eventually, won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977 and make changes not only for the city of San Francisco but his aim was fight for gay rights, civil rights in the state and inspired many in other states.We get to see the personal side of Harvey Milk as he was passionate about his role in politics but at the same time, knowing it would cost him his own personal relationships. By running for office, we get to see those close to Harvey such as Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch) who was a young man that Harvey saw potential for fighting for gay rights, especially California's anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 his campaign manager Anne Kronenberg (Allison Pill) who was very good at what she does and worked for Harvey Milk with no pay, Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber) who was open to working with Harvey and knew the importance of the gay vote for his upcoming re-election, Dick Pabich (Joseph Cross) and Michael Wong (Kelvin Yu) who worked with Harvey during his campaign and campaign photographer Danny Nicoletta (Lucas Gravbel) and many more.But the film also shows us the tragedy that took place on November 22, 1978 but how his legacy has helped breakdown some of the gates for many gay men and women. The film celebrates the life of Harvey Milk and reminds everyone of the many people who fought for their rights during that turbulent time.VIDEO & AUDIO:""MILK"" is featured in 1080p High-Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and for the most part, it's a pretty good looking film that tends to be creative with its use of older San Francisco video footage of Castro Street back in the 70's and meld it with today's modern film.  For the most part, there are times where the film looks colorful but at the same time, there is an intentional washed out feel towards the picture quality of the film.  From the production and set design to recreate that Castro Street 70's feel, there was a good amount of creative experimentation with the film.  But overall, cinematographer Harris Savides and editor Elliot Graham did a pretty solid job of piecing together the various video pieces and photography to the film.The film is not washed out in the DNR (digital noise reduction) type of way but more towards achieving a classic, vintage look that works perfectly for the film.  Noise is evident and giving the film that film-like quality via Blu-ray.The audio is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and although the film is dialogue driven and utilizes the front/center channel, there are occasional scenes that take advantage of the surround channels especially during crowd scenes.  I noticed also a bit of LFE not just in musical segments but in one scene, you can hear the thunder boom just a little.  So, there is a hint of other channels being utilized throughout the film.  But for the most part, it is a dialogue driven film.  And dialogue is clear and understandable.Subtitles are provided in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""MILK"" comes with the following special features in 1080i High-Definition with English Dolby Digital 2.0 audio:* Remembering Harry - (13:21) Those who worked with Harry such as former San Francisco Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, campaign writer Frank Robinson, campaign photographer Daniel Nicoletta, campaign director Anne Kronenberg, Coors boycott organizer Allain Baird and historical consultant Cleve Jones talk about working with Harry and remembering the day Harry was killed and the march that was done afterward.* Hollywood Comes to San Francisco- (14:32) Interviews with the cast and crew about being part of the film, working together and also some of the talent getting to meet their real life counterparts.  Also discussion of the casting of Sean Penn, how the director was found and filming the march scenes. And much, much more.* Marching for Equality (7:58) - Recreating the street march scenes (marches done after what took place in Dade County and in Wichita, Kansas).  Getting thousands of  volunteers to take part in the march and those who were around back then reminiscing about Harry and how the march and the set production reminded them of Castro Street back in the 70's and more.JUDGMENT cALL:""MILK"" is definitely a magnificent and powerful film! Sean Penn did a remarkable job playing that role and almost getting down the look and characteristics of Harvey Milk. But you also have to give credit to the cast and crew for capturing that moment in time. From the look and feel of 1970's San Francisco but also the costume design, the hair styles and it was great to see the original friends of Harvey Milk also have some involvement in the film.The overall style of the film is also quite fresh and for those of us who know of San Francisco now, getting a chance to see older footage of Castro Street back then was quite intriguing. But the most intriguing aspect of this film was to learn about Harvey Milk and what he stood for and the rights that he and others have fought hard for. And for those who have forgotten or have never heard of Harvey Milk, to know of the man and what he did for gay rights but also his belief in fighting for civil rights.As for the depiction of Dan White and also the whole political process, I know there is probably more to the story than what we saw in the film. The film did prompt be to further research what had took place at that time, especially with the Coors boycott, who is Anita Baker, the marches and the what took place at that time and of course, the death of Harvey Milk.But the screenplay written by Dustin Lance Black is solid, the recreation of this era was ambitious and the direction by Gus Van Sant and the performances by the various talent was quite solid.As for the Blu-ray release, I have been very pleased with Universal's Blu-ray releases thus far.  Picture quality are solid and for the most part, the lossless track for ""MILK"" is clear and understandable.  I wish there were more special features, possibly even commentary included but for the most part, all three special features were quite intriguing and enjoyable.For those who enjoyed ""MILK"", you really can't go wrong with the Blu-ray release.

1190527,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,B001FB55KI,Dexter Manning,"[4, 6]","It's a bitter irony that a major film about the iconic gay rights leader Harvey Milk should premiere in theaters across the country less than a month after Proposition 8 passed in California by voter referendum, thus barring gay marriage, for the moment. Similar laws were enacted in a number of other states in the country. One could imagine Milk may have been disheartened at such news, coming three decades after his efforts toward the civil rights struggles of a people. But, after seeing ""Milk,"" the newest movie about his activism, politics and life, one could imagine that he and his sizeable movement would be all the more determined to bring about equality for gays and lesbians.The movie, directed by Gus Van Sant (no stranger to films that speak against bigotry -- see ""Good Will Hunting"") from a script by Dustin Lance Black, traces the life of Milk from an average working-joe in New York harboring something of a mid-life crisis -- he says to his lover ""I'm forty years old, and I haven't done a single thing I'm proud of,"" he says -- his abrupt move with his partner to San Francisco, jump-starting his life in a down-and-out working-class neighborhood known as the Castro; opening a camera store there; becoming an advocate for gay rights in the neighborhood -- the ""mayor of Castro Street"" -- his determination to win elected city office (losing all but that last one); his fight against campaigns to quash gay rights; the rise of his political power; and, finally, the legacy that remains after his assassination.Appropriately, the picture is shot, by Director of Photography Harris Savides, largely with a documentary-style aesthetic that is both no-nonsense and candid, frequently mixing footage from actual marches, television reports, newspaper layouts and the like, into the rest of the film in a way that is relatively seamless (thanks, in part, to fine editing by Elliot Graham). My only quip about this is that perhaps the new scenes made for this film could have had a more grainy aesthetic to more thoroughly blend with the archival footage. But it's only a minor issue in a movie that is visually well-presented. The handful of new black and white stills pictures that Harvey takes of his partner, Scott, are particularly intriguing.The resemblance to a documentary style of filmmaking doesn't end there, of course. Since this drama is about real people and events, there's bound to be some aspect of it that feels like a documentary. ""Docudrama"" -- with the emphasis on the first half of the word --would be a convenient and apt description for this film, if one must categorize. In some ways this new film is a remake of ""The Times of Harvey Milk,"" a first-rate documentary directed by Robert Epstein that appeared nearly twenty-five years ago. If there's any drawback to the current ""Milk"" it's that it covers so much of the same ground as the older film that those who have seen Epstein's project already know much of what will transpire in the new version. Aside from that, the newer ""Milk"" does delve more deeply and satisfactorily into its main subject's personal life and, because of its status as a docudrama, Van Sant is able to utilize the tools of creative and dramatic license at his disposal much more freely than Epstein could have, to greater emotional impact. We see more actual dialogue and relationships between Milk and his partners, friends, colleagues and others, something that wouldn't be likely with a regular documentary. In this way the subject at the center of attention of the new film seems more soulful, more human than he would otherwise. (That's not a criticism of Epstein's film.) So does everyone around him. The movie does a remarkable job at making all these people seem real.An interesting and effective narrative device is employed. We see Harvey Milk, at the beginning of the movie and at various times throughout, recording a tape to be played only in the event he is assassinated, but what he says frames his story and helps move it along. It's a remarkable narration of subjective experiences, a kind of journal that, coupled with the film as a whole, is as close to being in Milk's head as we could ever be.The creative team captures the look and spirit of the Milk's time and place quite well, due in no small measure to Bill Groom's production design and Danny Glicker's clothing (and all that big hair). The actors look remarkably similar to the actual people they portray, with the centerpiece being the magnificent Sean Penn (""All the King's Men,"" ""Mystic River"") whose resemblance to his subject, Harvey Milk, is so uncannily close in appearance and voice one could mistake him for the actual person. It seems that Penn's looks did not have to be modified much as he looks much like Milk to begin with, though Milk's hair seems a bit curlier.His partner who first inspired him to move to the city by the bay in the first place is Scott Smith (James Franco) who begrudgingly tolerates his love's many campaigns while enthusiastically supporting the gay rights movement and re-examining his views on how people should deal with their own sexual orientation, especially in regard to coming out to family.Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch, late of the Sean Penn-directed ""Into the Wild""), with his thick mane of blond curls, outsize, dark-framed glasses, is a drifting tween trick who, with some inspiration from Milk, is recruited into his campaign, then becomes an aide on staff. Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) is a lesbian with hair as large and curly as Jones' who joins the campaign despite the all-male club's suspicions (an ironic but not uncommon prejudice) -- which soon evaporates when they see all the positive press their campaign receives shortly afterward. The passionate Jack Lira (Diego Luna) goes from down-and-out, but likeable, to Milk's closest lover in the latter part of the film; he's also easily the most needy and unconfident.But, the most lonely and unstable person in Milk's life is Dan White (Josh Brolin, ""W.,"" ""No Country for Old Men"") a former police officer and fireman, then fellow city supervisor elected at the same time as Milk, but from a conservative district and with an ideology to match. He eventually finds his time on the board to be one of alienation, while he witnesses the rising fortunes of Milk and Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber). The openly gay leftist Milk may very well be White's only friend on the board.It's a credit to this film that, even though it tells us at the beginning that Milk's life (and Moscone's) will be tragically cut short, and how it will end, when the moment finally does arrive, it is nonetheless utterly shocking and painful, preceded by much tension. The scene that follows qualifies as one of the most moving of the year, in a picture packed with many touching moments.It's also a credit that the film is willing to suggest that these activists for civil rights are diverse enough to have issues within their own ranks, such as the prejudice that exists between some gay men and lesbians toward members of the opposite sex, how -- or whether --to come out to family, friends, and colleagues (as above), and socioeconomic discrimination within the gay community. ""Milk"" does not obsess about such issues, but raising them furthers the film's sense of documentary-like reality, much more than would trying to paint a flat portrait in which all the countless members of a group agree on every last thing.It would not be surprising to see this film used as a rallying cry in the gay rights movement, especially in light of recent developments. In fact, it would be surprising to see it not used. ""Milk"" will be remembered as one of the milestones in gay cinema, and deserves honorable recognition as an important film about civil rights, and recognition as an important film, period. And, maybe even a gold statuette.",4,Milk: A Review.,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,7861,"['bitter', 'irony', 'major', 'film', 'iconic', 'gay', 'rights', 'leader', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'should',

1190531,A2BRZDMSGCYIKN,B001FB55KI,Dr. D,"[1, 1]","""Milk"" is one of those films that EVERY single human being should see.  The civil rights messages it clearly gets across are astoundingly powerful.  This isn't JUST a film about gay rights; it goes way beyond that sub-stratum of human society to include the basic, fundamental, inalienable rights endemic to the entire human race as a whole.The only minor gripe I have about this film, which doesn't detract from my stellar 5-star rating, is the fact that it's rated R.  I think if they toned down the language a bit by getting rid of the F words, and also deleting the celebratory fellatio scene between the two campaign aides, I think this film would be even more accessible to the public.  I would have then recommended that everybody aged 10 and up should watch this.As far as the acting is concerned, Sean Penn is brilliant.  Now I'm not normally a fan of Sean Penn at all.  In fact, I find him personally crude and a major sleazeball.  In this film, however, he deserved that Best Actor Academy Award...and then some.  His accurate portrayal of Harvey Milk is spot-on...right down to the looks!!  His resemblance to Harvey is strikingly eerie, and Penn seamlessly blends right into that role like it's his true nature.  Brilliant acting.  And who knows...maybe the fact that Harvey Milk looked like a sleazeball is exactly what made Sean Penn perfect for this role!  (I mean no offense to either men at all.)The other actors also did a superb job.  James Franco (another actor I personally can't stand) played a great supporting role as Harvey's lover.  Josh Brolin was also great as Dan White.  The director, Gus van Sant, also put in a few cameo appearances of Harvey Milk's actual staff members!  That was a nice treat, as Ms. Silver is a very dear friend of mine.Out of all the movies out there about human rights, this one is the BEST.  Personally, Harvey Milk is one of the most underrated civil rights figures in American history.  He even outweighs Martin Luther King, Jr.  Yes, I firmly believe that.  Just as MLK, Jr. was mostly for blacks and their civil rights, Harvey takes it one step further: He's both a model for gay AND white civil rights!If anybody asks me who my favorite civil rights activist and hero of all time is, I will proudly say, HARVEY MILK!",5,Revolutionary Cinema At Its Finest  [Blu-Ray],1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,2277,"['Milk', 'one', 'films', 'EVERY', 'single', 'human', 'being', 'should', 'see', 'civil', 'rights', 'messages', 'clearly', 'across', 'are', 'astoundingly', 'powerful', ""n't"", 'JUST', 'film', 'gay', 'rights', 'way', 'sub-stratum', 'human', 'society', 'include', 'basic', 'fundamental', 'inalienable', 'rights', 'endemic', 'entire', 'human', 'race', 'whole.The', 'only', 'minor', 'gripe', 'have', 'film', ""n't"", 'detract', 'stellar', '5-star', 'rating', 'fact', 'rated', 'R.', 'think', 'toned', 'down', 'language', 'bit', 'getting', 'rid', 'F', 'words', 'also', 'deleting', 'celebratory', 'fellatio', 'scene', 'two', 'campaign', 'aides', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'accessible', 'public', 'would', 'have', 'then', 'recommended', 'everybody', 'aged', '10', 'up', 'should', 'watch', 'this.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'brilliant', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'fan', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'fact', 'find', 'personally', 'crude', 'major', 'sleazeball', 'film', 'however', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'then', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'spot-on', 'right', 'looks', 'resemblance', 'Harvey', 'strikingly', 'eerie', 'Penn', 'seamlessly', 'right', 'role', 'true', 'nature', 'Brilliant', 'acting', 'who', 'maybe', 'fact', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'looked', 'sleazeball', 'exactly', 'what', 'made', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'perfect', 'role', 'mean', 'offense', 'men', 'other', 'actors', 'also', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'James', 'Franco', 'actor', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'played', 'great', 'supporting', 'role', 'Harvey', 'lover', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Dan', 'White', 'director', 'Gus', 'van', 'Sant', 'also', 'put', 'few', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'actual', 'staff', 'members', 'was', 'nice', 'treat', 'Ms.', 'Silver', 'very', 'dear', 'friend', 'mine.Out', 'movies', 'there', 'human', 'rights', 'one', 'BEST', 'Personally', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'civil', 'rights', 'figures', 'American', 'history', 'even', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr', 'Yes', 'firmly', 'believe', 'Just', 'MLK', 'Jr.', 'was', 'mostly', 'blacks', 'civil', 'rights', 'Harvey', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'model', 'gay', 'AND', 'white', 'civil', 'rights', 'anybody', 'who', 'favorite', 'civil', 'rights', 'activist', 'hero', 'time', 'will', 'proudly', 'say', 'HARVEY', 'MILK']",Milk

Political biographies are tough in that they always seem to have a clear agenda, and even though I happen to agree wholeheartedly with the message behind this one, it's still a very one-sided telling. The two factions at the center of the film's central argument are presented as sharply black and white, with few figures outside of Harvey's inner circle given credit for the reforms that were passed during his brief public career, and that seems to stand at odds with the core values of unity and equality that the film keeps talking up. Sean Penn deserves credit for his bold portrayal of the titular activist and politician; Milk's character arc is clear and powerful as we watch him grow from a shy, closeted New York businessman into a well-spoken social rights figurehead. That evolution is joyful but slow moving, and it often gets lost amongst the hustle and bustle of his increasingly active social and sex lives. It's an important story that's every bit as relevant today as it was in 1978, but the film translation lacks the punchiness and fresh identity I was looking for.

1190533,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001FB55KI,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","The combination of Sean Penn's fully immersed performance in the title role and Gus Van Sant's (Good Will Hunting) assured, almost understated direction transforms first-timer Dustin Lance Black's episodic screenplay into an emotionally riveting film that does the subject justice. This 2008 biopic could have been timelier only if it was released prior to the November defeat of Proposition 8, which eliminated the legality of same-sex marriage in California. Now there is a melancholy twist to the way the film documents the triumph in failing to pass the Briggs Initiative, a ballot proposition that would have outlawed gays from teaching in the state's public school system. The champion behind its defeat was a former insurance actuarial statistician named Harvey Milk, who moved with his much-younger lover Scott Smith from New York to San Francisco where they hoped to find acceptance of their lifestyle.Using as a running narrative device a tape recording that Milk made nine days before his assassination and interspersing archival footage, the film's plot follows Milk's growing political consciousness in face of the pervasive discrimination and violence against gays in the 1970's. He opens a camera shop in what was only beginning to be known as the Castro. Although Smith tires of his partner's obsessive activism and leaves him, Milk himself finds success as an openly gay city supervisor after two previous failed attempts. While on the Board, he meets the highly conservative Dan White, a family man struggling with his finances and personal demons. Things come to a head when White feels betrayed by Milk for his lack of support over banning a psychiatric hospital in White's district. At the same time, Milk was facing the daunting task of curtailing a burgeoning conservative movement led by former beauty queen Anita Bryant (whose newsreel appearances lend an eerie virulence to the story).The fight over the Briggs Initiative provides the film's eruptive climax, and the subsequent tragic events are all too familiar - especially to those of us who lived through them exactly thirty years ago. Van Sant wisely plays down the sensationalism in favor of a more human portrait of White during those times. Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men) gives an impressively textured performance as the embattled White conveying the inner conflict of a man who could never reconcile his traditional family values with the radical acceptance of the gay movement. Although he has less to do, James Franco is effective in showing Smith's ambivalence toward Milk's increasingly high profile. Also surprisingly good are Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild) as street punk-turned-gay rights activist Cleve Jones and former child actress Alison Pill as lesbian campaign manager Anne Kronenberg. The one fly in the ointment is Diego Luna (Mister Lonely) who plays Milk's lover Jack Lira as a pathetic co-dependent.Nonetheless, it is Penn who brings his chameleonic skill to the fore as Milk. His natural intensity is offset by an affability that is at once compelling and heartbreaking. More importantly, he provides the gravitas necessary to the tragedy of a voice that was silenced far too soon. Van Sant and Black do provide moments that seep into manipulation, such as the opera leitmotif and the inspiration provided by a wheelchair-bound teenager, but the resulting excesses are forgivable given the power and relevance of the subject.

For a Wednesday morning before Thanksgiving, the theater was half full.  By the end of it, there was a symphony of sniffling and nose blowing.  I knew by then that it was one of my favorite films I'd seen in some time and I'm glad that it's now on DVD where I can watch (and sniffle) in my own home.There have been several very good biopics in the past several years such as ""Frida"" and ""La Vie en Rose.""

I  must have seen a different film because I found the movie to be captivating from the casting, to period detail to Van Sant's directorial style which makes the movie feel like a 70s film, not just set in the 70s.  (Blending actual 70s footage with the movie was a good choice.)  Sure, some liberties have been taken but when haven't liberties been taken with biopics?  Milk lived 48 years; the film is two hours long.Sean Penn - justly awarded the Oscar for his work here- disappears into his role as the first openly gay man elected to public office, and it's the best performance I've seen him give.  I thought Penn was fine in ""Mystic River"" but the ""Is that my daughter in there?"" scene was a bit over the top but in ""Milk,"" Penn is restrained, humble and believable.  The rest of the cast is just as good, notably Josh Brolin as Dan White and Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones.  This film- despite Milk's fate- is uplifting and relevant.

1190535,A3A8P8IBH7L1WW,B001FB55KI,Edward,"[4, 12]","Senator Dianne Feinstein has distanced herself from ""Milk"", stating publicly that she did not even intend to see the film. This struck me as an odd attitude since she was present when the murders of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were committed in City Hall and shortly afterwards the ex-Supervisor Dan White turned himself in and was arrested. Perhaps Feinstein did not want to re-live that period in her life which must have been painful and perhaps a little embarrassing. (The fact is she was the President of the Board of Supervisors at the time, and the up-and-coming White was her prot&eacute;g&eacute;.) At any rate, the movie pretty much ignores her presence: she is seen in the genuine newsreel at the beginning, announcing the deaths to a stunned congregation, and later there's a couple of ""Hello, Diannes""s to an off-screen personage.  (In the Board of Supervisors sequence, she's just a blur in the background.) Then again it could be that Feinstein had an inkling of how superficial and misleading the tragedy was going to be presented on the screen and decided she wanted to stay as far away as possible. The problem is not just Dustin Lance Black's screenplay, though that is certainly problematic, but the unfortunate choice of director. With all the good directors working today (Peter Jackson, Antonia Bird, et al), why in the name of Griffith did the umpsteen producers hand this project over to the shallow Gus van Sant, unless they were certain of a predisposed audience and so the directorial talent didn't really matter. At least a competent director could have made the material seem a little less trivial. Of course, Harvey Milk has become a cult hero in the Castro (this is a Seventies Castro that Randy Shilts would barely have recognized: there's one brief interior shot of a bar) and therefore Milk's character has been somewhat softened. The lover who committed suicide is played on the screen like a dithering neurotic, whereas at the time he was seen as  a very dependent person who just couldn't deal with Milk's cold indifference. (Also at the time Senator Briggs was asked for a comment on the suicide and issued a very humane statement, a sympathetic note that this screenplay has censored.) Later in the film when Milk is projecting his ""outing"" campaign one of his colleagues brings up the right to privacy and Milk's response is ""Privacy is the enemy"". Is this suppose to be praiseworthy? It sounds dangerously close to demagoguery. (In fact, at one point Moscone asks ""Do you know who you sound like? Boss Tweed!"") The truth is Milk must have been a very scary specter to a mentality like Dan White, a narrow man with the anxiety of his convictions. The film's moods, bolstered by the type of biopic music that's usually described as ""soaring"", fluctuate between murky (Milk is suppose to have some sort of affinity with ""Tosca"") to maudlin (Milk gives hope to a wheelchair-bound boy right out of Leo McCarey), but the climax is revisional history at its worst. White, of course, could not pass the City Hall's main entrance metal detector with a pistol in his pocket. In real life White rapped on one of the basement windows, told a building inspector who he was and that he had misplaced his keys, and the building inspector opened the window and let him in.  This discomforting bit of history has been ""forgotten"" over the decades, but there it is on the front page of the San Francisco Examiner dated November 28 1978. In the movie version White simply pushes open the unlocked window and enters, talking fast when he's challenged by a City Hall employee. I suspect the film crew was allowed to do location work at City Hall with the official stipulation ""Don't make us look bad!"". Unfortunately, there's a great deal in ""Milk"" that looks bad.

1190537,A165QTRGCJVCZZ,B001FB55KI,Elton T. Elliott,"[2, 4]","I didn't really hear of Harvey Milk until after his death and it was only the fact that Sean Penn was playing his character in the film MILK that made me want to go see it.  I knew that anything Sean Penn took on was something that was always worth seeing.  I was not wrong, this film is not only worth seeing because of Penn and all of his fellow actors that tell the story of this gay hero thirty years after his death, it is another benchmark film of what finally coming out and finding a purpose for living did for this gay man.  The effects of it extended to the lives of those he lived and worked with while he was still here, and through their deeds after he died had a more far reaching effect on those of us who never knew him even the ones who were not yet born.The film begins with Harvey Milk making a tape in the event of his assassination but quickly flashes back to the eve of his 40th birthday when he meets Scott Smith, a younger gay man for what both of them probably think is going to be simply another one-night stand.  Harvey had spent his years as a gay man up to this point being very guarded about his sexuality because it was what all gay men did at the time.  Gay liberation had only started within the year after the 1969 Stonewall Riots (he met Smith in 1970 in NYC).  The affair quickly grew into a relationship and they moved to San Francisco and started a business in the Castro District.  The joy of finding Scott and the struggles they went through to open their business in the Castro as a gay couple served to make Harvey question his past closeted gay life and he quickly began to realize that the only way to make a change for themselves and the other gay men in that area was to run for public office as an openly gay man.Falling in love and coming out changed Harvey Milk from being a man guarding his sexuality into one who celebrated that love and one who wanted other gays to realize the same freedom that brings and the new self-esteem that accompanies it.  It brought out his charm, brazenness, and his ability to win people over finally to his cause.  And, it was this very positive self-esteem Milk possessed that in the end made him Dan White's arch enemy.  I don't believe that it was Harvey's political successes that made White so jealous of him but the self-esteem that Dan so desperately lacked.  I have no way of knowing if Dan White was a closet gay man or not, nor do I care.  The very fact that Dan White later committed suicide after his imprisonment, points to his self-hatred for something that was inside him that he couldn't stomach.  Harvey Milk came to realize that living in the closet makes that self-hatred for gays fester and he did everything he could to help us rid ourselves of that self-hatred.  The political advances that he helped to bring about for gays is wonderful in and of themselves, but even more important is the lives he touched after his own personal liberation and the love that he shared.  It was a love that was so strong it still exists and spreads itself thirty years after his death.I want to thank everyone involved in bringing this important story of Harvey Milk to film.  It's a story that no one who watches will soon forget.  If you live in an area that it's showing, go see it and if it's not yet playing near you, watch for it.",5,COMING OUT WORKS MIRACLES,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,3324,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hear', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'death', 'was', 'only', 'fact', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'playing', 'character', 'film', 'MILK', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'knew', 'anything', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'took', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'always', 'worth', 'seeing', 'was', 'not', 'wrong', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Penn', 'fellow', 'actors', 'tell', 'story', 'gay', 'hero', 'thirty', 'years', 'death', 'benchmark', 'film', 'what', 'finally', 'coming', 'out', 'finding', 'purpose', 'living', 'did', 'gay', 'man', 'effects', 'extended', 'lives', 'lived', 'worked', 'was', 'still', 'here', 'deeds', 'died', 'had', 'more', 'far', 'reaching', 'effect', 'who', 'never', 'knew', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'yet', 'born.The', 'film', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'making', 'tape', 'event', 'assassination', 'quickly', 'flashes', 'back', 'eve', '40th', 'birthday', 'when', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'younger', 'gay', 'man', 'what', 'probably', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'simply', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Harvey', 'had', 'spent', 'years', 'gay', 'man', 'up', 'point', 'being', 'very', 'guarded', 'sexuality', 'was', 'what', 'gay', 'men', 'did', 'time', 'Gay', 'liberation', 'had', 'only', 'started', 'year', '1969', 'Stonewall', 'Riots', 'met', 'Smith', '1970', 'NYC', 'affair', 'quickly', 'grew', 'relationship', 'moved', 'San', 'Francisco', 'started', 'business', 'Castro', 'District', 'joy', 'finding', 'Scott', 'struggles', 'went', 'open', 'business', 'Castro', 'gay', 'couple', 'served', 'make', 'Harvey', 'question', 'past', 'closeted', 'gay', 'life', 'quickly', 'began', 'realize', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'change', 'other', 'gay', 'men', 'area', 'was', 'run', 'public', 'office', 'openly', 'gay', 'man.Falling', 'love', 'coming', 'out', 'changed', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'being', 'man', 'guarding', 'sexuality', 'one', 'who', 'celebrated', 'love', 'one', 'who', 'wanted', 'other', 'gays', 'realize', 'same', 'freedom', 'new', 'self-esteem', 'brought', 'out', 'charm', 'brazenness', 'ability', 'win', 'people', 'finally', 'cause', 'was', 'very', 'positive', 'self-esteem', 'Milk', 'possessed', 'end', 'made', 'Dan', 'White', 'arch', 'enemy', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'Harvey', 'political', 'successes', 'made', 'White', 'so', 'jealous', 'self-esteem', 'Dan', 'so', 'desperately', 'lacked', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'Dan', 'White', 'was', 'closet', 'gay', 'man', 'not', 'do', 'care', 'very', 'fact', 'Dan', 'White', 'later', 'committed', 'suicide', 'imprisonment', 'points', 'self-hatred', 'something', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'came', 'realize', 'living', 'closet', 'self-hatred', 'gays', 'fester', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'help', 'rid', 'ourselves', 'self-hatred', 'political', 'advances', 'helped', 'bring', 'about', 'gays', 'wonderful', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'lives', 'touched', 'own', 'personal', 'liberation', 'love', 'shared', 'was', 'love', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'still', 'thirty', 'years', 'death.I', 'want', 'thank', 'everyone', 'involved', 'bringing', 'important', 'story', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'film', 'story', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'soon', 'forget', 'live', 'area', 'showing', 'go', 'see', 'not', 'yet', 'playing', 'watch']",Milk
1190538,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B001FB55KI,e. verrillo,"[3, 4]","By and large, Milk was an excellent film. Sean Penn was superb as Harvey Milk, and the supporting cast was flawless. The device of moving back and forth in time to present Milk's evolution into a political figure was well done, as were the clips of actual footage, which lent an air of authenticity to a film that might otherwise have slipped into sentimentality.I do, however, have one sole critique of this wonderful rendition of Harvey Milk's life, and that is that parts of the film were unexpectedly  toned down. Violence against the gay community was much, much worse than depicted, and the gay community's response was far from turning the other cheek. (No pun intended.) The characters (all real people) ended up being smaller than life, not bigger. (This was especially true of Dan White's character, who we never really understand. What exactly motivated him to kill Milk and Moscone?) And during the early 70s--the height of the anti-war movement, civil rights, the feminist movement, etc.-- all hell was breaking loose all over the country, yet San Francisco appeared to be floating in a sea of tranquility. Even though I loved the film, I kept feeling that something essential was missing: tension.I understand that in order to achieve widespread appeal it is sometimes necessary to make sacrifices. A producer (or director, or writer) won't take risks if he/she thinks the project will be harmed. However, in this case just a little more unvarnished reality would have done the film--and us--a world of good. We need to see how civil rights are fought for, undermined, and resurrected with all the messy intensity of that battle left intact.(Postscript: Since submitting this review I had the opportunity to watch the documentary, The Times of Harvey Milk, which won a well-deserved Academy Award in the mid-1980s--and which I highly recommend. The two films provide a perfect complement to one another--each mutually filling in the gaps in Harvey's story. But what the documentary had, and which nothing else will ever come close to, is the real Harvey Milk. Eloquent, powerful and sharp as a tack, he truly inspired people. If he hadn't been assassinated, and if Americans had been willing to vote an openly gay man into higher office, he would have risen far.)",4,"Excellent film overall, but needed something more",1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,2277,"['large', 'Milk', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'superb', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'flawless', 'device', 'moving', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'present', 'Milk', 'evolution', 'political', 'figure', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'were', 'clips', 'actual', 'footage', 'lent', 'air', 'authenticity', 'film', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'slipped', 'sentimentality.I', 'do', 'however', 'have', 'one', 'sole', 'critique', 'wonderful', 'rendition', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'life', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'unexpectedly', 'toned', 'down', 'Violence', 'gay', 'community', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'depicted', 'gay', 'community', 'response', 'was', 'far', 'turning', 'other', 'cheek', 'pun', 'intended', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'smaller', 'life', 'not', 'bigger', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'Dan', 'White', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'understand', 'What', 'exactly', 'motivated', 'kill', 'Milk', 'Moscone', 'early', '70s', 'height', 'anti-war', 'movement', 'civil', 'rights', 'feminist', 'movement', 'etc.', 'hell', 'was', 'breaking', 'loose', 'country', 'yet', 'San', 'Francisco', 'appeared', 'be', 'floating', 'sea', 'tranquility', 'Even', 'loved', 'film', 'kept', 'feeling', 'something', 'essential', 'was', 'missing', 'tension.I', 'understand', 'order', 'achieve', 'widespread', 'appeal', 'sometimes', 'necessary', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'producer', 'director', 'writer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'risks', 'he/she', 'project', 'will', 'be', 'harmed', 'However', 'case', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'unvarnished', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'world', 'good', 'need', 'see', 'how', 'civil', 'rights', 'are', 'fought', 'undermined', 'resurrected', 'messy', 'intensity', 'battle', 'left', 'intact', 'Postscript', 'submitting', 'review', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'documentary', 'Times', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'mid-1980s', 'highly', 'recommend', 'two', 'films', 'provide', 'perfect', 'complement', 'one', 'mutually', 'filling', 'gaps', 'Harvey', 'story', 'what', 'documentary', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'close', 'real', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Eloquent', 'powerful', 'sharp', 'tack', 'truly', 'inspired', 'people', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'assassinated', 'Americans', 'had', 'been', 'willing', 'vote', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'higher', 'office', 'would', 'have', 'risen', 'far']",Milk

We first meet Milk when he picks up a new boyfriend in New York on his 40th birthday, and he concludes that he has not done anything he would be proud of. The couple decides to move to San Francisco when they open a shop with photo equipment in the Castro which gradually changes into a gay district it is today. Yet successful as he is as a buisnessman, Milk yearns for more. He repeatedly runs for the city council and succeeds at the third time, trying another local election in the meantime. The costs of his campaigns are high - his boyfriend leaves him, a new one proves to be mentally unstable. Milk reaches his goal, he becomes the first openly gay person elected to a high office in the USA. As a politician he is quite successful, the movie concentrates on a campaign he orchestrates successfully defeats proposed law banning teaching posts to homosexuals. Yet in the process he offends (unintentionally and the man is quite clearly presented as having serious issues) one of his colleagues who ends up shooting both the Mayor of San Francisco and Milk himself.

1190541,AY12DBB0U420B,B001FB55KI,Gary Peterson,"[2, 2]","In thinking back over my high school years in the early 50s in Boulder, CO, I must have come into contact with at least 1000 students of that age and I cannot recall knowing of a single homosexual (gay or lesbian). Such matters were just not revealed or discussed, except in bad-taste jokes. My parents and other adults seemed not at all inclined to yield any information about the subject, nor did they point their fingers at any known suspects. I grew up almost totally ignorant and it wasn't until I went to college and graduate school (Boulder, CO, and Seattle, WA, in late 50s and early 60s) that I even became aware that there was such a thing as a gay community (not called gay at the time).Flash forward to the present. I've now attended three San Diego area Gay Pride parades, large festive gatherings attended by thousands of open gays in amusing and outrageous get-ups and gathering thousands and thousands of interested and generally supportive spectators along the way. Oh sure, there are the preachers, angry people carrying placards and police ready to go into riot mode at an instant's notice, but that just adds to the charm and festivity of the gathering. It's a fun annual event. If your community has one, be sure to take it in. It's highly educational and very worth while.Well, the difference certainly marks a radical change in our society and one I never would have anticipated. The change has been gradual over those 60 years and punctuated by killings, beatings, court orders, protests, voting on propositions and what not all. Cultural changes are not easy and this one has been an especially difficult struggle. I've always been on the outside looking in and it represents an extremely interesting period of cultural change.Last night, my wife and I viewed the movie ""Milk"" on DVD. The story involves Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the US and the people he was surrounded by and the context of the time they were in. The story took place largely in the Castro District of San Francisco where Milk was elected as a City Supervisor. The movie is stunningly well done. Kudos to director Gus Van Sant. It's done up as a semi-biography in a subdued documentary style. To me, as a total outsider, I would say the movie was fair and balanced. If you have strong views one way or another, you may have a different interpretation. Sean Penn and the rest of the cast do a marvelous job with the acting. The whole story is very believable.

1190542,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B001FB55KI,Giordano Bruno,"[3, 5]","That's the emblematic maxim from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: ""Shame on anyone who thinks evil."" It comes to mind in reference to the scenes of male-with-male sexual behavior in the film Milk. Those scenes will be the sticking point, I predict, for many viewers who might otherwise grudgingly acknowledge the knightly character of Harvey Milk. Remember, Gawain, Lancelot, Parzifal, even Arthur were all ""stained"" by carnal sin, for which their searches for the Holy Grail remained unfulfilled. Milk was, and is portrayed as, a knightly crusader not only for ""gay rights"" but for humane tolerance for all and for economic justice for the needy. This film is not a shallow 'hagiography' - not the moralistic biography of a Saint. ""Milk"" shows Milk at some of his weakest moments, beset by his own compulsions and sorrows, and by his narrowness of empathy. The core of the film, emotionally, is Harvey's relationship with Dan White, the man who eventually murders him. It's the portrayal of that relationship that elevates the film from a docu-drama to an antique tragedy. It's painful to watch. Neither man is capable of yielding trust or respect to the other. Neither man perceives the other as a real human being. White, of course, is as much the wicked dragon in the tale as Milk is the White Knight, but their mutual inability to 'touch' each other leads to tragedy for both. Milk's  effort to keep White from being reappointed, when White's power is already marginal, is clearly depicted as a fatal error based on the arrogance bred by success.Like a tale of chivalry, the other Knights of the Castro skirmish, triumph, or fall nobly in the political tourney that surrounds the White/Milk drama. It's a reasonably honest and faithful portrayal of events - the campaigns for office, the battle against the Briggs Initiative. Mayor George Moscone gets short shrift; he was a more savvy and effective leader in real life than in this film, in the transformation of San Francisco from a stuffy backwater to a City on the Hill for progressivism and tolerance. In retrospect, Milk sops up all the glory.The Oscar race is finished. Sean Penn doesn't merely act the role of Milk; he reincarnates the man. I met Milk a few times, at Labor Council sessions. I swear that if I met his ghost tomorrow, I'd be surprised how much he looks like, moves like, talks like the Milk in the film. If I try to visualize the dead Harvey Milk, it's Penn whom I'll see forevermore. And Josh Brolin has the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in his ample pocket for his heart-breaking portrayal of Dan White, the saddest figure in the saga.Bigots, attention please! If you have any respect for great acting, even you will have to admire the performances in this film.

1190544,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001FB55KI,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","MILK is one of the more powerful bio-epics produced by Hollywood.  Harvey Milk, the man honored by this superbly crafted film by writer Dustin Lance Black and directed by Gus Van Sant, is brought to life by Sean Penn in his most skilled performance of his fine career.  Not only is this movie an homage to Harvey Milk, but it is also a shaking reminder of the ferocious ongoing battle for Civil Rights.  Few viewers will come away from this  film untouched.The life of gay activist Harvey Milk is well known, as is his assassination as he finally reached a platform where his voice could be heard.  Black and Van Zant have wisely started the story with some black and white footage of the abuse of the gay population across the country and then ease into the biography by showing us Milk in New York, approaching his 40th birthday and  discovering Scott Smith (James Franco) as the beginning of not only a  tender partnership but also a change in Milk's drive to make a difference.  The climb to importance from his migration to Castro Street in San Francisco and the 'recruiting' of his clan (Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones et al) and the struggles he faced in gaining acceptance of a minority group is the stuff of legends.Penn is extraordinary, but Franco, Hirsch, Josh Brolin  as Milk's assassin, and Diego Luna as the kinky Jack Lira turn in excellent performances.  Van Zant is unafraid to show the tenderness among his characters: it is satisfying to see prominent male actors take on roles that include same sex intimacy.  This is a film that deserves to enter the archives as one of the 'greats.'  Highly recommended.

1190545,A1Y8IUMN7TBKS,B001FB55KI,Groovy Vegan,"[1, 2]","There are actors who can totally become the character they portray, to the point where they're almost channeling them:  Meryl Streep, Helen Mirren, Tina Fey...  Sean Penn is one of those actors.  He totally becomes Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician elected to office in the U.S., in appearance, voice, and mannerisms.  It helps that Penn, with half Lithuanian and Russian Jewish ancestry, strongly resembles Milk, needing only the same haircut and perhaps some Grecian Formula to complete his physical transformation.I think Penn is one of the best actors of our time.  He's a heterosexual who can very convincingly play a homosexual, and a schmuck who can very convincingly play a nice guy, in this Academy award winning best actor performance..But the main reason to watch this movie is not to marvel at Penn's acting skills.  There's important political history to watch, with implications not only in San Francisco where he was elected after several attempts, but in cities and states all over the U.S., and internationally, such as in homophobic Jamaica, where openly gay behavior carries up to 10 years in prison.  Unlike black history where school children are taught about how Rosa Parks refused to sit in the back of the bus, and women's history, where children learn about Susan B. Anthony and other suffragettes, who is ever taught about gay civil rights?  A movement still very much underway, as gay people fight for the right to marry, receive spousal benefits, and visit their dying partners in the hospital.San Francisco wasn't always friendly to gay people.  Gay merchants and renters were routinely discriminated against, as the movie shows.  But gay businessman, Harvey Milk, had enough, and organized voting power and buying power into social justice, forming alliances along the way, including the powerful Teamsters union.  Penn perfectly captured the humor, charisma, media savvy and grassroots organizing it took to accomplish this.  Milk paved the way for San Francisco to become more gay-friendly, and for other cities to follow suit, including Houston, TX, the 4th largest city in the U.S., which elected their first openly gay mayor in Dec. 2009.  The movie also shows how Harvey Milk was an important force in derailing the bigoted Joseph McCarthey-esque statewide Briggs Initiative, which would have required the firing of gay teachers and their supporters in the California Public Schools.So watch the movie to experience Penn's fine acting, as well as the fine acting of his supporting cast, but more importantly, to see and *learn from* political history.  Those interested in fighting the Anita Bryants of today, might want to pick up a pen and take some notes.  (Anita Bryant was a former beauty queen and Florida orange juice promoter who organized fellow born again Christians to discriminate against gay people.)P.S.  As someone who was around in the late 70s, I marvel at how well the movie got the feel of the era down.  Men's and hair styles, oversized by today's standards eye glasses, makeup down to the blue eye shadow, the cars--all authentic.  I was glad someone had saved some old push-button office phones with the flashing hold buttons, typewriters, Zenith color TV's, and an old cassette tape recorder from the late 70s.  That stuff seems so old-fashioned now, but it was state of the art modern back then, as the phones weren't rotary, the typewriters were electric and not manual, and the tape recorder was much smaller than the reel-to-reel.  I really felt like I was back in the late 70s, disco music and all.",5,"Sean Penn channels the late Harvey Milk, in a civil rights battle that still rages today",1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,3573,"['are', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'totally', 'become', 'character', 'portray', 'point', 'where', ""'re"", 'almost', 'channeling', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'one', 'actors', 'totally', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'politician', 'elected', 'office', 'U.S.', 'appearance', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'Penn', 'half', 'Lithuanian', 'Russian', 'Jewish', 'ancestry', 'strongly', 'Milk', 'needing', 'only', 'same', 'haircut', 'perhaps', 'Grecian', 'Formula', 'complete', 'physical', 'transformation.I', 'think', 'Penn', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'time', 'heterosexual', 'who', 'can', 'very', 'convincingly', 'play', 'homosexual', 'schmuck', 'who', 'can', 'very', 'convincingly', 'play', 'nice', 'guy', 'Academy', 'award', 'winning', 'best', 'actor', 'performance..But', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'marvel', 'Penn', 'acting', 'skills', 'important', 'political', 'history', 'watch', 'implications', 'not', 'only', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'was', 'elected', 'several', 'attempts', 'cities', 'states', 'U.S.', 'internationally', 'such', 'homophobic', 'Jamaica', 'where', 'openly', 'gay', 'behavior', '10', 'years', 'prison', 'black', 'history', 'where', 'school', 'children', 'are', 'taught', 'how', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'refused', 'sit', 'back', 'bus', 'women', 'history', 'where', 'children', 'learn', 'Susan', 'B.', 'Anthony', 'other', 'suffragettes', 'who', 'ever', 'taught', 'gay', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'underway', 'gay', 'people', 'fight', 'right', 'marry', 'receive', 'spousal', 'benefits', 'visit', 'dying', 'partners', 'hospital.San', 'Francisco', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'friendly', 'gay', 'people', 'Gay', 'merchants', 'renters', 'were', 'routinely', 'discriminated', 'movie', 'gay', 'businessman', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'had', 'enough', 'organized', 'voting', 'power', 'buying', 'power', 'social', 'justice', 'forming', 'alliances', 'way', 'including', 'powerful', 'Teamsters', 'union', 'Penn', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'humor', 'charisma', 'media', 'savvy', 'grassroots', 'organizing', 'took', 'accomplish', 'Milk', 'paved', 'way', 'San', 'Francisco', 'become', 'more', 'gay-friendly', 'other', 'cities', 'follow', 'suit', 'including', 'Houston', 'TX', '4th', 'largest', 'city', 'U.S.', 'elected', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'mayor', 'Dec.', '2009', 'movie', 'also', 'how', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'was', 'important', 'force', 'derailing', 'bigoted', 'Joseph', 'McCarthey-esque', 'statewide', 'Briggs', 'Initiative', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'firing', 'gay', 'teachers', 'supporters', 'California', 'Public', 'Schools.So', 'watch', 'movie', 'experience', 'Penn', 'fine', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'more', 'importantly', 'see', '*learn', 'from*', 'political', 'history', 'interested', 'fighting', 'Anita', 'Bryants', 'today', 'might', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'pen', 'take', 'notes', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'was', 'former', 'beauty', 'queen', 'Florida', 'orange', 'juice', 'promoter', 'who', 'organized', 'fellow', 'born', 'again', 'Christians', 'discriminate', 'gay', 'people.', 'P.S', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'around', 'late', '70s', 'marvel', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'got', 'feel', 'era', 'down', 'Men', 'hair', 'styles', 'oversized', 'today', 'standards', 'eye', 'glasses', 'makeup', 'down', 'blue', 'eye', 'shadow', 'cars', 'authentic', 'was', 'glad', 'someone', 'had', 'saved', 'old', 'push-button', 'office', 'phones', 'flashing', 'hold', 'buttons', 'typewriters', 'Zenith', 'color', 'TV', 'old', 'cassette', 'tape', 'recorder', 'late', '70s', 'stuff', 'so', 'old-fashioned', 'now', 'was', 'state', 'art', 'back', 'then', 'phones', 'were', ""n't"", 'rotary', 'typewriters', 'were', 'electric', 'not', 'manual', 'tape', 'recorder', 'was', 'much', 'smaller', 'reel-to-reel', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'back', 'late', '70s', 'disco', 'music']",Milk

1190548,A9I40WFF40R4,B001FB55KI,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[4, 6]","Harvey Milk, along with Supreme Court Justice Douglas, will always be my hero. As the first openly gay person to be elected to pubic office anywhere in the United States in 1977, after many unsuccessful campaigns in San Francisco, Milk brought hope to many gay people throughout the United States. It is so appropriate 30 years from the date of his assassination by Dan White that this fine film is released, on the heels of the passage of Proposition 8 in California that prohibits same-sex marriage but also just after the victory of Barack Obama who ran a campaign to unite all kinds of people, just as Milk did in California thirty years ago. He ran a campaign of hope that appealed to all of what he called the ""uses"" of the world, minorities, gays, the disabled, the elderly, the unions.This movie is worthy of such a hero. The director Gus Van Sant looks at both Milk's political career and his personal life that was not always happy-- specifically his relationship with Jack Lira (Diego Luna). There are so many touching moments in the film, for instance, Milk's telephone conversation with a young gay man who who has seen Milk's picture in the media. He is about to be taken by his parents to an institution to be ""fixed"" because of his homosexuality. When Milk tells him to run away and go to any large city, he explains to Milk that he uses a wheelchair.The acting is superb: Josh Brolin as Dan White, Fames Franco as Scott Smith, Allison Pill as Anne Kronenberg and especially Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones. Then there is Sean Penn who becomes Harvey Milk. He is perfect as the character, even bearing a striking resemblance to Milk. The cinematography is so good that it is impossible to separate the documentary footage from  the rest of the film. Puccini and Judy Garland singing ""Over the Rainbow"" are nice touches as well.This so sad but yet hopeful film should be seen by every gay and lesbian  who was not alive in 1978 as well as the rest of the world. I was glad to see that Randy Shilts' wonderful biography of Milk has been re-released also. In 1987 when the AIDS quilt was first unfurled in Washington, D. C., I remember seeing painted on a subway wall the words ""Harvey Milk lives.""

The events told by this biopic happened rather far away from me, so that I knew little of its story from memory.All in all, I would say, bigotry is far less widespread in Germany than in the US (the debates over gay marriage, that I could follow on CNN and also with American friends recently, were rather shocking. We have some major political leaders, who are openly gay, in Germany, and there is very little fuss about it), so the 'issue' is not so present in my political awareness.It seems to me that the movie is a solid product which presents the problems and the story adequately, without idealisation or undue cosmetical surgery. It is not a full analysis of the development and its implications, nor a romantic fairy tale about a tragic hero.Penn does a fantastic job.

1190552,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B001FB55KI,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Don't fall in the easy trap of the parallel with the recent proposition against same-sex marriage. Little to do. On one side a politician who knew what he was doing, on the other side amateurs who thought the battle could be won without real canvassing. Don't fall into another trap: the parallel with Obama's campaign on hope. Those two dimensions exist but they cannot be considered as the essential meaning of this film and certainly not the most important element about the story and the character, the real man behind this character. What is the main theme of this film? Though it speaks mostly of homosexuality, it is not about homosexuality, or at least not only. It concerns us all: it is about the freedom of each individual in our world to believe in, think as true and practice the life styles they want, the religions they want, the cultural, political, social, philosophical and all other imaginable orientations they want. This is written on The statue of Liberty and at the very beginning of the Declaration of Independence, and, though the film does not say, in the first amendment to the constitution. This is universal and this concerns some countries like France for example where some beliefs are supposed not to be expressed publicly in institutions like schools or public administrations by students or personnel. That universal freedom is one of the most denied freedoms in the world. Even today in advanced developed countries various orientations, and always in the name of privacy or private life which makes it an obligation for minorities to hide or be victimized, be they sexual or religious, or whatever. We can trust the human species to be segregative always and on unforeseen and unforeseeable subjects. The human species is fundamentally segregative and equality is a constant and never irreversible battle. The second important element has to do with political activism. A political campaign can only be victorious if it does not concern a narrow group and its privileges. It has to concern a fundamental right that may then concern the vast majority of the people: if that right is denied to one person in the whole social order, then that right is endangered for everyone. The only way to convince the vast majority of the population that this is so is to come out and show everyone that they have lived with some of these people all their life, as neighbors, colleagues, schoolmates or whatever. A right can only be won if the people concerned get out of the closet, cupboard or cabinet in which they lock themselves and start canvassing, provided this right they're going to canvass for is a right that everyone can claim or enjoy, not the privilege of the happy few, like retiring at 50 with a full pension. Canvassing requires courage and dedication, because it has to convince people and not force them into doing this or not doing that. The last element is that in the American society there is a very much privileged minority, the police. The situation is a lot better today with guaranteed diversity, when it is guaranteed, but still the spirit of being over the law because of the uniform or the gun is still very present in their minds. The latest of such events in France was the release by a cop of a piece of evidence against some accused people before these people had had the opportunity to defend themselves in court. In this film, the ex-cop kills the Mayor of San Francisco and a City Supervisor out of cold blood, after having broken into the city hall, and he only got five years of prison for manslaughter and not murder. That was practically an accident if we follow that line pr approach. But the film is very clear about the use of violence in politics: it creates a political backlash and even at times a social backdraft and not progress.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",5,The future is in peaceful convincing,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,3916,"['Do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'easy', 'trap', 'parallel', 'recent', 'proposition', 'same-sex', 'marriage', 'Little', 'do', 'one', 'side', 'politician', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'other', 'side', 'amateurs', 'who', 'thought', 'battle', 'could', 'be', 'won', 'real', 'canvassing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'trap', 'parallel', 'Obama', 'campaign', 'hope', 'two', 'dimensions', 'exist', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'essential', 'meaning', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'story', 'character', 'real', 'man', 'character', 'What', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'mostly', 'homosexuality', 'not', 'homosexuality', 'least', 'not', 'only', 'freedom', 'individual', 'world', 'believe', 'think', 'true', 'practice', 'life', 'styles', 'want', 'religions', 'want', 'cultural', 'political', 'social', 'philosophical', 'other', 'imaginable', 'orientations', 'want', 'written', 'statue', 'Liberty', 'very', 'beginning', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'film', 'not', 'say', 'first', 'amendment', 'constitution', 'universal', 'countries', 'France', 'example', 'where', 'beliefs', 'are', 'supposed', 'not', 'be', 'expressed', 'publicly', 'institutions', 'schools', 'public', 'administrations', 'students', 'personnel', 'universal', 'freedom', 'one', 'most', 'denied', 'freedoms', 'world', 'Even', 'today', 'advanced', 'developed', 'countries', 'various', 'orientations', 'always', 'name', 'privacy', 'private', 'life', 'obligation', 'minorities', 'hide', 'be', 'victimized', 'be', 'sexual', 'religious', 'whatever', 'can', 'trust', 'human', 'species', 'be', 'segregative', 'always', 'unforeseen', 'unforeseeable', 'subjects', 'human', 'species', 'fundamentally', 'segregative', 'equality', 'constant', 'never', 'irreversible', 'battle', 'second', 'important', 'element', 'do', 'political', 'activism', 'political', 'campaign', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'victorious', 'not', 'concern', 'narrow', 'group', 'privileges', 'concern', 'fundamental', 'right', 'may', 'then', 'concern', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'right', 'denied', 'one', 'person', 'whole', 'social', 'order', 'then', 'right', 'endangered', 'everyone', 'only', 'way', 'convince', 'vast', 'majority', 'population', 'so', 'come', 'out', 'show', 'everyone', 'have', 'lived', 'people', 'life', 'neighbors', 'colleagues', 'schoolmates', 'right', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'won', 'people', 'concerned', 'get', 'closet', 'cupboard', 'cabinet', 'lock', 'start', 'canvassing', 'provided', 'right', ""'re"", 'going', 'canvass', 'right', 'everyone', 'can', 'claim', 'enjoy', 'not', 'privilege', 'happy', 'few', 'retiring', '50', 'full', 'pension', 'Canvassing', 'courage', 'dedication', 'convince', 'people', 'not', 'force', 'doing', 'not', 'doing', 'last', 'element', 'American', 'society', 'very', 'much', 'privileged', 'minority', 'police', 'situation', 'lot', 'better', 'today', 'guaranteed', 'diversity', 'when', 'guaranteed', 'still', 'spirit', 'being', 'law', 'uniform', 'gun', 'still', 'very', 'present', 'minds', 'latest', 'such', 'events', 'France', 'was', 'release', 'cop', 'piece', 'evidence', 'accused', 'people', 'people', 'had', 'had', 'opportunity', 'defend', 'court', 'film', 'ex-cop', 'Mayor', 'San', 'Francisco', 'City', 'Supervisor', 'cold', 'blood', 'having', 'broken', 'city', 'hall', 'only', 'got', 'five', 'years', 'prison', 'manslaughter', 'not', 'murder', 'was', 'practically', 'accident', 'follow', 'line', 'pr', 'approach', 'film', 'very', 'clear', 'use', 'violence', 'politics', 'political', 'backlash', 'even', 'times', 'social', 'backdraft', 'not', 'progress.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",Milk
1190553,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B001FB55KI,James Hiller,"[2, 3]","As the new Gus Van Sant movie begins, he decides to remind those of us who have forgotten, and those of us who never knew, about the status of gay life in the United States around the time Milk begins. We see times when even gathering together in a public space was enough to warrant an arrest, or at least intentional harassment by the police. It's chilling and sad to know about the norm of life that people like myself had to endure just to be. Plus, it subtly puts Milk into his context, and into finding his need for change.Harvey Milk, a Long Island San Franciscan transplant, camera store owner, and many time political candidate, would become for gay and lesbian people what other inspirational leaders would become for their causes. He starts out as many do as they enter the political arena, getting involved in local politics, due to an overwhelming need to create a better life for himself, his partner Scott, and his friends. Soon, politics would consume him and his relationships, and become a driving force as other driving forces would work to try to defeat him.  Once getting to the Board of Supervisors, Harvey spent eleven months trying to work for his constituents and work to defeat a hideous ballot proposition before being assassinated.Van Sant's Milk is mostly a docudrama, relying heavily on recounting Harvey's story, including an inside look at his relationships. The movie never wanders over into glorifying Milk into a superficial hero, but paints a more honest portrait. Milk mistakes hard decisions, mistakes, and also celebrates his successes and achievements. Those familiar withThe Times of Harvey Milk 1984will recognize immediately some missing names (Sally Gearhart comes to mind), but there is a complicit understanding that biopics needs to change/alter some details to compress what could easily be a four hour movie. Van Sant's direction is spot on, and invisible.However, what transforms this movie is clearly Sean Penn's amazing, amazing performance. Okay, I'll be the first one to admit that I wasn't sure that Penn could pull off this role. Within the first two minutes of the film, I changed my mind. Heck, just watching the trailer, I changed my mind. Penn transforms himself, totally, and becomes Milk. He doesn't ever truly look like him, but through his voice, mannerisms, he projects Milk in a way I don't think any other actor could ever pull off. Just watch the scene when proposition six is surprisingly defeated, and the campaign headquarters erupts; Penn engaging in a joyful scream communicates such elation is totally Milk, and I literally forgot, for those few moments, that I was watching a movie. Say hello to another Oscar, Mr. Penn. You certainly earned it.Those who are gay come with a sense of appreciation and awe of Harvey's story. Those who are straight may learn a sense of the struggle that differentness brings to those in this country who do not fit into to the traditional mode. As Milk ends, and the miles long candlelight procession winds it's way through the streets of San Francisco, the words of a politician who ran on hope and was killed for it echo the current election and another politician who ran on hope. It's a poetic sense of continuity; those of us who work to end bigotry and intolerance end up benefiting all. Perhaps Van Sant started Milk with scenes of bar arrests to show us our history, but also, to show us just how far we've come.",5,Never Blend In,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,3427,"['new', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'movie', 'remind', 'who', 'have', 'forgotten', 'who', 'never', 'knew', 'status', 'gay', 'life', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'Milk', 'see', 'times', 'when', 'even', 'gathering', 'together', 'public', 'space', 'was', 'enough', 'warrant', 'arrest', 'least', 'intentional', 'harassment', 'police', 'chilling', 'sad', 'know', 'norm', 'life', 'people', 'had', 'endure', 'just', 'be', 'subtly', 'Milk', 'context', 'finding', 'need', 'change.Harvey', 'Milk', 'Long', 'Island', 'San', 'Franciscan', 'transplant', 'camera', 'store', 'owner', 'many', 'time', 'political', 'candidate', 'would', 'become', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'people', 'what', 'other', 'inspirational', 'leaders', 'would', 'become', 'causes', 'out', 'many', 'do', 'enter', 'political', 'arena', 'getting', 'involved', 'local', 'politics', 'due', 'overwhelming', 'need', 'create', 'better', 'life', 'partner', 'Scott', 'friends', 'Soon', 'politics', 'would', 'consume', 'relationships', 'become', 'driving', 'force', 'other', 'driving', 'forces', 'would', 'work', 'try', 'defeat', 'Once', 'getting', 'Board', 'Supervisors', 'Harvey', 'spent', 'eleven', 'months', 'trying', 'work', 'constituents', 'work', 'defeat', 'hideous', 'ballot', 'proposition', 'being', 'assassinated.Van', 'Sant', 'Milk', 'mostly', 'docudrama', 'relying', 'heavily', 'recounting', 'Harvey', 'story', 'including', 'inside', 'look', 'relationships', 'movie', 'never', 'over', 'glorifying', 'Milk', 'superficial', 'hero', 'more', 'honest', 'portrait', 'Milk', 'hard', 'decisions', 'mistakes', 'also', 'successes', 'achievements', 'familiar', 'withThe', 'Times', 'Harvey', 'Milk', '1984will', 'recognize', 'immediately', 'missing', 'names', 'Sally', 'Gearhart', 'mind', 'complicit', 'understanding', 'biopics', 'needs', 'change/alter', 'details', 'compress', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'four', 'hour', 'movie', 'Van', 'Sant', 'direction', 'spot', 'invisible.However', 'what', 'movie', 'clearly', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'one', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Penn', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'first', 'two', 'minutes', 'film', 'changed', 'mind', 'Heck', 'just', 'watching', 'trailer', 'changed', 'mind', 'Penn', 'totally', 'Milk', ""n't"", 'ever', 'truly', 'look', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'projects', 'Milk', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'ever', 'pull', 'off', 'Just', 'watch', 'scene', 'when', 'proposition', 'six', 'surprisingly', 'defeated', 'campaign', 'headquarters', 'erupts', 'Penn', 'engaging', 'joyful', 'scream', 'communicates', 'such', 'elation', 'totally', 'Milk', 'literally', 'forgot', 'few', 'moments', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'Say', 'hello', 'Oscar', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'certainly', 'earned', 'it.Those', 'who', 'are', 'gay', 'come', 'sense', 'appreciation', 'awe', 'Harvey', 'story', 'who', 'are', 'straight', 'may', 'learn', 'sense', 'struggle', 'differentness', 'brings', 'country', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'traditional', 'mode', 'Milk', 'miles', 'long', 'candlelight', 'procession', 'way', 'streets', 'San', 'Francisco', 'words', 'politician', 'who', 'ran', 'hope', 'was', 'killed', 'current', 'election', 'politician', 'who', 'ran', 'hope', 'poetic', 'sense', 'continuity', 'who', 'work', 'end', 'bigotry', 'intolerance', 'end', 'up', 'benefiting', 'Perhaps', 'Van', 'Sant', 'started', 'Milk', 'scenes', 'bar', 'arrests', 'show', 'history', 'also', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come']",Milk

1190556,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B001FB55KI,James Morris,"[116, 136]","Gus Van Sant has always been an excellent if somewhat eclectic director.  Although I have enjoyed his previous efforts, I was somewhat apprehensive when I heard he was undertaking a film biography of Harvey Milk.  A gay figure of this importance, I thought, should be handled by someone a little more mainstream.  Like many gay people, I am weary of gay-themed films that reach no one beyond a gay audience, and the message I would want to emerge from a film about Harvey Milk should be heard by everyone.As if reading my mind, Mr. Van Sant has fashioned a film that is accessible to all, while approaching his subject with sharp focus and a singleness of purpose that is at once definitive and topical.  A stunning achievement, MILK manages to make its point without ever being preachy or trite, while remaining as true to the facts as any film bio could ever hope to be.The film opens with snippets of gay history that many young gay people, let alone a straight audience, may be shocked to discover.  During the opening credits, a barrage of vintage film clips remind us that a scant 50 years ago, gay men, lesbians and transsexuals were subjected to violence, harassment, physical abuse, arrest and humiliation by the very people that most citizens look to for protection; i.e. the police and judicial authorities.  The newsreel images of gay bar raids that open MILK project a surreal yet somehow eerily familiar atmosphere that seems to alternate between the bizarre and the barbaric.  Many people today are not aware that, in the 1940's and 1950's, right here in the USA, gay people were arrested for simply patronizing a gay bar (newspaper headline: ""Den of Perverts Busted"").  Many of those arrested had their names and employers published in the morning paper (!), and often found themselves unemployed and unemployable, branded with the label of ""deviate"".  It is this chilling fact of social injustice that clears the way for the film's swing into a very important piece of gay history.Skillfully telling us the story of Milk's rise as a leader in the Castro Gay Community of San Francisco, Harvey Milk is seen throughout the film as a living, breathing flesh and blood person.  Van Sant adroitly propels Sean Penn through a warts-and-all portrayal of a frail human being with an idealistic bent and a politician's savvy.  As with any good film, it is difficult, if not impossible, to discern which is more impressive - the balance of a perfect cast and lovingly detailed direction weave their way through a seamless portrait of an important historical figure, yet we are somberly reminded that many people remember Harvey Milk solely for the ""Twinkie"" defense of his star-crossed killer.  The end result is that gay audiences emerge from seeing this film with a sense of pride and purpose, while straight audiences leave with a better knowledge of who we (gay people) are, what we want, and what we are struggling for.  By word of mouth I expected a thrilling cinematic experience; what I got was a surprisingly near-perfect motion picture and some of the best acting I've ever seen.  I heartily recommend MILK to any straight person who wants to get a grasp on what the last 30 years of gay history were really all about, and any gay person who wants to feel good about themselves.

1190557,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B001FB55KI,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[4, 5]","Harvey Milk was an American politician, a visionary, and, in 1977, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office - as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He was also a staunch and effective activist for the civil rights of gays, lesbians, and consequently, for all Americans who deserve equal rights under our Constitution.Forty-something Milk, (played by Sean Penn in an Academy Award performance), an insurance salesman, and his companion, Scott Smith, (James Franco), moved from New York City to San Francisco in 1972. The couple set up house in the Castro District, a mecca for gays and hippies, where they opened a camera shop. This was before the AIDS epidemic descended upon the community and so tragically decimated their population. Harvey and Scott observed, and were subject to, increasing bigotry, attacks and physical intimidation, as more homosexuals came out of the closet. This vicious behavior took place not only in San Francisco but all over the US. Anti-gay sentiments were fueled by the likes of gospel singer Anita Bryant, known for her strong views against homosexuality and for her prominent campaigning in 1977 to repeal a local ordinance in Dade County, FL, that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Also, California State Senator John Briggs saw an opportunity in the Christian fundamentalists'  movement to attack Milk and all homosexuals, calling his hate mongering, ""just politics."" Milk organized not only the homosexual community, but other groups as well  - blacks, Hispanics, and Teamsters - to form coalitions against those who would oppress them.Tenacious to the cause, Harvey Milk ran for election numerous times, experiencing disappointment after disappointment. Ever optimistic, however, even after Scott left him due to an overdose of politics, Milk claimed, rightly so, that in each election his numbers went up significantly. Finally he won, serving as Supervisor, along with Senator-to-be Diane Feinstein, and Dan White, (Josh Brolin), a conservative from a neighboring Irish-Catholic district.After a series of personal and political conflicts, the increasingly erratic White shot and killed both Mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk in their offices at City Hall in 1978. White was trying to rescind his resignation as supervisor and blamed the mayor and Milk for blocking his reinstatement. Harvey Milk, during his career on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, promoted larger and less expensive child care facilities, free public transportation, and the development of a board of civilians to oversee the police. He sponsored a civil rights bill that outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, Milk's most important achievement was in helping to defeat Proposition 6, initiated by John Briggs. The proposed law would have made firing gay teachers - and any public school employees who supported gay rights - mandatory. Milk campaigned his heart out and debated Briggs on several occasions. One can only wonder what Harvey Milk would have accomplished had he lived just a few years longer.""Milk"" is no ordinary biopic. It is a most powerful, stirring and intelligent film that ditches the usual docudrama format. Director Gus Van Sant, along with the extremely talented Sean Penn, and an outstanding supporting cast, have brought to life the energetic, charismatic, optimistic, loving, talented, extraordinary character who was Harvey Milk. Penn movingly reveals the vulnerable side of Milk, as well as demonstrates his self-deprecating humor. Harvey Milk's struggle to make people see what is wrong and do what is right is extremely moving, and his fiery oratory electrifying. The use of real historical footage infuses a sense of authenticity to the story.This is a wonderful movie. I also recommend seeing the 1984 documentary ""The Times Of Harvey Milk"" directed and written by Rob Epstein.Jana PerskieThe Times of Harvey Milk 1984",5,"""All men are created equal.

1190561,A9TG2NFA614S9,B001FB55KI,John F. Rooney,"[4, 5]","""Milk"" is one of the best and most devastating movies I have seen in this decade. Harvey Milk is beautifully portrayed by Sean Penn in an absolutely flawless performance. The film is photographed with great sensitivity and power using some footage from the period. An activist who changed the gay world forever, Milk had a personal life that was severely challenged by his public political stands. The movie spends a great deal of time filling in the details of Milk as a person and a lover. It doesn't shirk from showing his erotic gay side.The movie makes him a martyr, but so was Martin Luther King, Gandhi and so were many others who defied contemporary morals and ethics. The film is very good at portraying the organization of political lieutenants that Milk built up. It makes Milk funny, vulnerable, driven, sympathetic, and has examples of the oratory he used to sway his advocates. If there is a villain in the piece it is Anita Bryant who had an agenda of prejudice and hate that motivated Milk and his allies. White, Milk's killer, is portrayed as a deeply troubled man who was predetermined by destiny to cut down his rival.The movie depicts the birth of the Castro in San Francisco as a gay area. Milk was one of the first merchants there with his camera store. He learned the power of organization by starting a gay owners' association which rivaled the straight merchants' groups.This film gives everything a sense of urgency and intensity which adds to its power. You feel as if you are living his life with him.For those who did not live through the Milk era this is a history lesson, but it also does a fine job of delineating any kind of political activist.

Having lived in San Francisco during the events depicted (my boss at the time was David Goodstein, who is portrayed rather flatteringly in the film), I can attest to the astonishing accuracy of the production, everything from the costumes to hairstyles and even the look of apartments at the time. The way the director is able to seemlessly blend the drama with actual documentary footage is a testament to the remarkable realism he has achieved. It's an incredibly moving story of a genuine gay martyr.

There's an Oscar winning performance by Sean Penn, strong supporting cast especially James Franco, and a story about a man overcoming the prevailing social morays of the time, and of course the direction of Gus Van Sant. All the elements for a great movie are here, but I found it a sterile rendition of Harvey Milk's life.Milk is the story of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) the first openly gay supervisor in San Francisco. The movie starts with Milk in New York on the eve of his 40th birthday not having accomplished much except being a successful insurance agent. He moves to San Francisco with his lover Scott (James Franco) and they open a camera store. Soon they encounter prejudice and Harvey soon becomes a community organizer and activist and runs a perennially losing candidacy for the position of supervisor. It takes redistricting in 1977 to win Milk a seat as supervisor, where he takes on the forces of oppression in the form of a State Senator, Anita Bryant (saying a lot more stupid things than I remember), and colleague Dan White (Josh Brolin), whom Milk believes is a closeted homosexual, but we're never shown any evidence of this, just Milk (Penn's) word on it. White and Milk nominally become friends trading vote for vote on each others pet causes until Milk fails to support a bill White believes Milk had promised support for. The resulting humiliation leads White to shoot Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone.I've thought about the reasons why this movie wasn't compelling for me, and it's really hard to put a finger on.1) The performances are uniformly solid, I can't think of one weak link in any of the performances. We're privy to the life and loves of Harvey Milk so he'll be a sympathetic character. We're told that Harvey has had four relationships in his life, three of which ended in the suicide of his partner, and soon we're presented with the 4th suicide in his life.2) The period footage adds depth and gives a face and feel to San Francisco of the late 70's.3) I thought maybe the reason is I'm not gay. But I'm not black and I've found the biographies of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X both insightful and moving. I also thought Brokeback Mountain was a moving and compelling movie.Maybe what's missing is the why behind Harvey Milk. Why he so easily becomes an activist. Milk does make a few references to being in the closet  for a long time, maybe if we were shown his personal struggle we would have understood a little his motivations as the man he was to become in his public life.The bonus features are kind of thin. There's the almost ubiquitous deleted scenes, 3 documentaries, one a remembrance of Harvey Milk by his friends who are salted throughout the movie, the making of documentary, and one on how the 30,000 person march at the end of the movie was done.",3,"Elements For a Great Movie Present, But Something Missing",1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,2907,"['came', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Milk', 'really', 'expecting', 'like', 'least', 'more', 'did', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'James', 'Franco', 'story', 'man', 'overcoming', 'prevailing', 'social', 'morays', 'time', 'course', 'direction', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'elements', 'great', 'movie', 'are', 'here', 'found', 'sterile', 'rendition', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'life.Milk', 'story', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'supervisor', 'San', 'Francisco', 'movie', 'Milk', 'New', 'York', 'eve', '40th', 'birthday', 'not', 'having', 'accomplished', 'much', 'being', 'successful', 'insurance', 'agent', 'San', 'Francisco', 'lover', 'Scott', 'James', 'Franco', 'open', 'camera', 'store', 'Soon', 'encounter', 'prejudice', 'Harvey', 'soon', 'community', 'organizer', 'activist', 'perennially', 'losing', 'candidacy', 'position', 'supervisor', 'redistricting', '1977', 'win', 'Milk', 'seat', 'supervisor', 'where', 'forces', 'oppression', 'form', 'State', 'Senator', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'saying', 'lot', 'more', 'stupid', 'things', 'remember', 'colleague', 'Dan', 'White', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'whom', 'Milk', 'closeted', 'homosexual', ""'re"", 'never', 'shown', 'evidence', 'just', 'Milk', 'Penn', 'word', 'White', 'Milk', 'nominally', 'become', 'friends', 'trading', 'vote', 'vote', 'others', 'pet', 'causes', 'Milk', 'support', 'bill', 'White', 'Milk', 'had', 'promised', 'support', 'resulting', 'humiliation', 'White', 'shoot', 'Milk', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Mayor', 'George', 'Moscone.I', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'really', 'hard', 'put', 'finger', 'on.1', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'solid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'weak', 'link', 'performances', ""'re"", 'privy', 'life', 'loves', 'Harvey', 'Milk', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sympathetic', 'character', ""'re"", 'told', 'Harvey', 'had', 'four', 'relationships', 'life', 'three', 'ended', 'suicide', 'partner', 'soon', ""'re"", 'presented', '4th', 'suicide', 'life.2', 'period', 'footage', 'depth', 'face', 'feel', 'San', 'Francisco', 'late', ""70's.3"", 'thought', 'maybe', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'gay', ""'m"", 'not', 'black', ""'ve"", 'found', 'biographies', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'Malcom', 'X', 'insightful', 'moving', 'also', 'thought', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'moving', 'compelling', 'movie.Maybe', 'what', 'missing', 'why', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Why', 'so', 'easily', 'activist', 'Milk', 'make', 'few', 'references', 'being', 'closet', 'long', 'time', 'maybe', 'were', 'shown', 'personal', 'struggle', 'would', 'have', 'understood', 'little', 'motivations', 'man', 'was', 'become', 'public', 'life.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'kind', 'thin', 'almost', 'ubiquitous', 'deleted', 'scenes', '3', 'documentaries', 'one', 'remembrance', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'salted', 'movie', 'making', 'documentary', 'one', 'how', '30,000', 'person', 'march', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'done']",Milk

1190568,A1AKQ1YUS4BT82,B001FB55KI,"Katie Babs ""Katiebabs""","[2, 2]","The movie Milk, stars Sean Penn as Harvey Milk, who became a Gay Rights activist and city politician. Harvey was elected to San Francisco's Board of Supervisors in 1977, making him the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the USA. Harvey's story is both an inspiration, as well as a tragedy, for he and the city's mayor was gunned down by another city supervisor who was so very jealous of Harvey's popularity. Dan White blamed Harvey Milk for all his failures, and because he murdered Harvey in cold blood, he made Harvey a martyr to his cause.Just as the rights of gay Americans was a very strong topic for the decade of the 70's, over 30 years later, much of what Harvey Milk wanted for himself, and others like him still rings true today. After seeing Milk, whether or not you agree or don't agree with the lifestyle Harvey led, you will leave with a better understanding how important human rights are to all human beings, regardless of sexuality, age, gender or race. Harvey fought for all these groups who were abused by the police, treated with distain by the politicians as well as the community who felt they were in their rights to treat those as second-class citizens. Just as Martin Luther King fought for civil rights in the 1950's and 60's, Harvey Milk fought for the rights of gay Americans in the 70's. It is such a shame, for if he had lived, he would have accomplished so much more in the decades to come, perhaps even having a shot at becoming the President of the United States.Milk begins with Harvey, played by the excellent, Sean Penn, in 1978 recording his biography into a take recorder to be played in case he is assassinated. He tells of how at the age of forty, while he was working in New York City, that he was living a lie. He was gay and kept this lifestyle hidden. Harvey felt he hadn't accomplished anything worthwhile, and decides to throw caution to the wind and moves to San Francisco with his lover, Scott Smith, who is played by James Franco. Both Sean and James have incredible chemistry together, and their relationship as two men in love was a beautiful thing to watch. These men were not only lovers, but also the best of friends. When they arrive in San Francisco, Harvey decides to open a camera store. He is met with opposition from the local business owners because he of his sexual preference. But that does not stop Harvey. With a twinkle in his eye and a smile, he opens his store. From there he wants to make things better for the gay community. Along with the unions, he begins to stand up for those around him. Harvey becomes a role model to those who feel hopeless. He wants to help the young teen hustlers get off the street, and in a way becomes a father to these boys and men. One hustler, Cleve Jones, played by Emile Hirsch, is the most affected by Harvey. Some may recognize the name of Cleve Jones. By Cleve meeting Harvey, who changes his life, he eventually does something so amazing towards the understanding of HIV and the AIDS virus. What Cleve creates, is something so large that it can no longer fit together as one piece on the Mall in Washington D.C. (Can you guess what it is? Some of these pieces came to my college for the students to view)Harvey begins to create a team of advisors, and plans to run for a seat on the Board of Supervisors for the city. It takes him three times, and when he finally is elected, it may seem to be a small feat, but to Harvey and his friends and associates, it is the beginning of acceptance, and the possibility to make some major changes in the United States. For one short year, Harvey does some incredible things for the gay community as well for the city of San Francisco. I would say that Harvey Milk is the reason so many have come out of the closet. He believed that a person should be proud of who they are and should not hide.I felt like I was watching history with Milk. It touched upon so many important topics that again ring so true as we enter a new year. In 1977 it was a heated topic whether homosexuals should continue to teach in schools, or be fired from their job because of their sexual preference, as well as having equal housing. Today the question raised is about gay marriage and if that should be written into law. If Harvey was alive today, you can bet he would fight for that right.The Sean Penn's acting was spectacular, and don't be surprised if he walks away with the Oscar for Best Actor. His portrayal of Harvey Milk was perfect as he showed Harvey's joy and passion, as well as his beliefs.There are not many movies that teach me a lesson, but Milk certainly opened my eyes. If there is one movie you should see before the year is over, Milk is definitely one of them.Katiebabs",4,Thought Provoking Movie- Must See (A Grade),1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,4736,"['movie', 'Milk', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'who', 'became', 'Gay', 'Rights', 'activist', 'city', 'politician', 'Harvey', 'was', 'elected', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Board', 'Supervisors', '1977', 'making', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'be', 'elected', 'public', 'office', 'USA', 'Harvey', 'story', 'inspiration', 'as', 'well', 'tragedy', 'city', 'mayor', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'city', 'supervisor', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'jealous', 'Harvey', 'popularity', 'Dan', 'White', 'blamed', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'failures', 'murdered', 'Harvey', 'cold', 'blood', 'made', 'Harvey', 'martyr', 'cause.Just', 'rights', 'gay', 'Americans', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'topic', 'decade', '70', '30', 'years', 'later', 'much', 'what', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'wanted', 'others', 'still', 'true', 'today', 'seeing', 'Milk', 'not', 'agree', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'lifestyle', 'Harvey', 'led', 'will', 'leave', 'better', 'understanding', 'how', 'important', 'human', 'rights', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'regardless', 'sexuality', 'age', 'gender', 'race', 'Harvey', 'fought', 'groups', 'who', 'were', 'abused', 'police', 'treated', 'distain', 'politicians', 'as', 'well', 'community', 'who', 'felt', 'were', 'rights', 'treat', 'second-class', 'citizens', 'Just', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'fought', 'civil', 'rights', '1950', '60', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'fought', 'rights', 'gay', 'Americans', '70', 'such', 'shame', 'had', 'lived', 'would', 'have', 'accomplished', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'decades', 'come', 'perhaps', 'even', 'having', 'shot', 'becoming', 'President', 'United', 'States.Milk', 'Harvey', 'played', 'excellent', 'Sean', 'Penn', '1978', 'recording', 'biography', 'take', 'recorder', 'be', 'played', 'case', 'assassinated', 'how', 'age', 'forty', 'was', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'living', 'lie', 'was', 'gay', 'kept', 'lifestyle', 'hidden', 'Harvey', 'felt', 'had', ""n't"", 'accomplished', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'moves', 'San', 'Francisco', 'lover', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'who', 'played', 'James', 'Franco', 'Sean', 'James', 'have', 'incredible', 'chemistry', 'together', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'was', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'watch', 'men', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'lovers', 'also', 'best', 'friends', 'When', 'arrive', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Harvey', 'open', 'camera', 'store', 'met', 'opposition', 'local', 'business', 'owners', 'sexual', 'preference', 'not', 'stop', 'Harvey', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'smile', 'store', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'gay', 'community', 'unions', 'stand', 'up', 'Harvey', 'role', 'model', 'who', 'feel', 'hopeless', 'help', 'young', 'teen', 'hustlers', 'get', 'street', 'way', 'father', 'boys', 'men', 'One', 'hustler', 'Cleve', 'Jones', 'played', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'most', 'affected', 'Harvey', 'may', 'recognize', 'name', 'Cleve', 'Jones', 'Cleve', 'meeting', 'Harvey', 'who', 'life', 'eventually', 'something', 'so', 'amazing', 'towards', 'understanding', 'HIV', 'AIDS', 'virus', 'What', 'Cleve', 'something', 'so', 'large', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'fit', 'together', 'one', 'piece', 'Mall', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Can', 'guess', 'what', 'pieces', 'came', 'college', 'students', 'view', 'Harvey', 'create', 'team', 'advisors', 'plans', 'run', 'seat', 'Board', 'Supervisors', 'city', 'three', 'times', 'when', 'finally', 'elected', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'small', 'feat', 'Harvey', 'friends', 'associates', 'beginning', 'acceptance', 'possibility', 'make', 'major', 'changes', 'United', 'States', 'one', 'short', 'year', 'Harvey', 'incredible', 'things', 'gay', 'community', 'as', 'well', 'city', 'San', 'Francisco', 'would', 'say', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'come', 'closet', 'believed', 'person', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'who', 'are', 'should', 'not', 'hide.I', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'history', 'Milk', 'touched', 'so', 'many', 'important', 'topics', 'again', 'ring', 'so', 'true', 'enter', 'new', 'year', '1977', 'was', 'heated', 'topic', 'homosexuals', 'should', 'continue', 'teach', 'schools', 'be', 'fired', 'job', 'sexual', 'preference', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'equal', 'housing', 'question', 'raised', 'gay', 'marriage', 'should', 'be', 'written', 'law', 'Harvey', 'was', 'alive', 'today', 'can', 'bet', 'would', 'fight', 'right.The', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'acting', 'was', 'spectacular', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'away', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'portrayal', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'was', 'perfect', 'showed', 'Harvey', 'joy', 'passion', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'movies', 'teach', 'lesson', 'Milk', 'certainly', 'opened', 'eyes', 'one', 'movie', 'should', 'see', 'year', 'Milk', 'definitely', 'one', 'them.Katiebabs']",Milk

Every seat was filled up and the beautiful old theater grew warm with anticipation.  I was a little skeptical, as perhaps others in the crowd, all thinking, ""Sean PENN as Harvey?""  And yet by the end of the movie our palms were raw from clapping so hard.  We clapped for every actor, we clapped for every real life person they were playing, even the ones we dislike in real life!  We clapped for the young screenwriter who put it all together (Dustin Lance Black), but most of all we clapped for Gus Van Sant, whose legendary stamp is all over every frame of the picture.  Black's script, and Van Sant's reputation, lured in some of the cinema's brightest talent, and the effort paid off mightily.We loved the filmmakers' efforts to show us the old San Francisco, before cell phones and computers, when Dianne Feinstein always wore that curious hat that looked like a baby bat, but peach colored.  The Castro theater itself was restored to its garish 70s look, and the costumes were great.  Some have criticized Diego Luna's shambles of a performance, but I thought he was great and really the only one to carry off the 70s look without blushing.  Oh that hair!  It was interesting seeing the different ways the straight actors decided to play gay.  Emile Hirsch?  Just imitating Alioia Silverstone in Clueless.  James Franco?  Just played it like he was super high all the time with a huge stoner grin.  Ryan from High School Musical?

1190570,AHBKHBIWDTI5I,B001FB55KI,Kevin Mattingly,"[5, 8]","I will watch any movie that is directed by Gus Van Zant and ""Milk"" is the best example so far as to why. Some of his films are a bit obtuse for many mainstream film watchers but those have always been the films that have appealed to me the most. There are elements of the obscure, most notably the leading character of Harvey Milk, but this is far more accessible and worthwhile for its inspiration than some of his other work.Harvey Milk is a very charismatic and complicated gay man in San Francisco and Sean Penn gives this role his all and it is very obvious that he did his homework. It is indeed the antithesis of the type of role that one would expect Penn to play based on his past performances and he manages a transformation that almost seems to transcend mere acting.The pacing of the film is fantastic and keeps the viewer engaged and pulls you in as it perfectly captured the tone of each scene through the acting, music and ambiance. Very few films are on the precipice of art these days and this was a refreshing departure from the mainstream or even the stereotypical gay characters that one often sees portrayed in films. Penn bared his heart as Harvey Milk to the point that it was almost hard to watch until one of those down scenes were punctured by a triumph and we were rolling along again.The bigotry and police attacks that homosexuals were, and still are in some places, subjected to prods Milk to take a detour from his camera shop to engage in organizing rallies and fighting for gay rights in a extremely direct way at a time where many viewed this sexual predisposition as an abomination, as depicted in the sweeping of gay bars and downright harassment by the police who were presumably being paid to protect those very rights.Times have changed for the better in the arena of gay rights and this film will undoubtedly help to take another step forward in the thinking of many who are still semi-homophobic. The caliber of cast and the brilliant production, directing and acting will pull people in who wouldn't ordinarily think about gay issues and this film has the fortitude and the performances have the believability and command to help sway minds toward a more tolerant society.Just as important is the statement this film makes that one person can make a difference about any political issue if they are so motivated to do so. Harvey was ahead of his time, but without his time, we wouldn't have ours.This is a five star movie and it is also one of the few IMPORTANT films that I have seen recently. It is about the struggle for gay rights but many of the same themes of changing an unacceptable status quo are relevant to any group who are in a fight for their rights and respect.Cinema lovers and anyone with a pulse should see this movie. This is a landmark film and history will look back kindly on it.Kevin W. MattinglyHarrisburg Times.",5,"GAY ACTIVISM RISING.

1190573,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B001FB55KI,lily t.,"[0, 0]","I loved the movie when I saw it in the theaters. Watching it a again with a slightly more critical eye, I thought the first part was pure genius until it became more conventional in the latter half.Perhaps I am feeling sentimental but the beginning  was simply enchanting, featuring one of the best pick up scenes in all cinema as the homely middle aged Harvey Milk, on the basis of his sweet talking charm, seduces gorgeous Scott Smith. At the end of the evening, Milk confesses that at age 40, he has done nothing true or worthwhile. Scott, who is the perfect and perfectly easy going foil for tightly wound, closeted Harvey, suggests he might want to do something to change that.Still at the beginning of their romance, the two men move to SF's Castro Street area&#8212;and it's a tribute to the director and those behind the scenes, who were able to recreate those heady times, when the promise of of post 60's liberation was in the air for many groups-and particularly for the gay community, so terribly marginalized and deeply despised in America. And it is the dark side - the harassment, violence, lack of police protection, backlash by the Christian right which galvanizes Harvey, who is experiencing his own r/evolution, into action.Harvey is more than intelligent- he is street smart- and understands the economic clout he and his friends can bring to bear on the area by patronizing or boycotting businesses. He then goes one step further to create coalitions between unions, the elderly in the district and the gay population&#8212;and promulgates his vision for a more empathetic community. Through all this, Scott, with his gentle charm which deflates any pretensions or overreaching on Harvey's part, keeps him balanced and sane.But once Harvey, choosing his political career over the relationship,  allows Scott to leave, the movie [ for me at least] begins to falter. Far too much time is spent on Cleve Jones and the machinations of the campaign, and the personal life is relegated to a few snapshots of the woefully miscast Diego Luna as an unstable boyfriend. We segue into political office a bit too quickly&#8212;while too much of that time is spent on newsreels of the bats*** crazy Anita Bryant [ when you see her rolling her eyes and spewing inhumane venom in that saccharine sweet voice while  invoking the Bible, you'll think of Sarah Pailin as an evolutionary leap forward] and the religious right [ then ascending to power] which wants to fire all gay teachers in the state -and their supporters for the imaginary crime of corrupting children.The lumbering and slow witted Dan White then appears and because we never really understand his motivation [ politically betrayed by Harvey, closeted, envious, under too much pressure and needs to discharge his stress by killing two human beings?], there is an inability on the part of the film maker to elevate Harvey to iconic status [ seemingly his intention]. Certainly the shooting, as portrayed, seems incidental to Harvey Milk's career as the first openly homosexual elected official in the USA. This could have been handled more delicately&#8212;you could almost envision the end being scripted in manner reminiscent of a latter day Tolstoy or the offhandedness of a Chekov&#8211;the irony or inexplicability of a random shooting when Harvey had come so far and was gaining acceptance for his cause.Perhaps I am being too critical; my hetero libertarian husband had to be dragged to see Milk in the theater but got misty eyed at the end and rooted for the film in every single academy award category [ even the ones it wasn't nominated for].

1190574,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B001FB55KI,Linda Linguvic,"[1, 2]","Sean Penn won an Oscar for his outstanding performance in this 2008 film.  No wonder.  He is simply magnificent.  And, in my opinion, the film is a winner in every category.  Not only does it tell the true story of the man himself, Harvey Milk, who, in 1977 was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and was the first openly gay elected official in America, it is the story of a movement and a time and a place in history that defined a watershed of change.Bravo to the filmmakers!  The casting is perfect with James Franco playing the long-time boyfriend of Harvey Milk and Josh Brolin cast in the role of a troubled fellow city supervisor, who in an insane frenzy, brutally murdered both Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco, George Moscone in 1978.We first meet Milk, a 40-year old New York businessman, who changes his life dramatically by embracing the counter-culture movement and moving to San Francisco in the early 1970s with his young lover.  They live in the Castro district, which is fast becoming a Mecca for gays, opening a camera store and fighting the establishment.  Soon, Milk becomes political, running for public office.  He loses, not once but twice, but, finally, when he changes his hippie appearance and starts to wear suits, he eventually is elected.  He fights vigorously for gay rights, influencing gays to unite and ""come out of the closet"" and mostly, because of his activism and his strong  personality, a proposition to keep gays from teaching in public schools, promoted by the gay-bashing activist, Anita Bryant, was defeated.Sadly, Harvey Milk served a mere 11 months in office before he was assassinated.  But the changes he brought about are living on as the concept of inclusion is a reality in our culture today.  The cinematography and direction are exceptional and there is not a dull moment in the film.  I loved every minute of it. Hooray for Harvey Milk!

Audiences from across the spectrum, whether they've never heard of Harvey Milk, or were in the midst of the Castro in the 70s, this film will touch you, infuriate you, make you laugh, and make you stand up and cheer; and if you're not of the 'stand up and cheer' type, it will change you:  forever and for better.  Milk is a monument to a political monolith, he was arguably the MLK of the LGBT movement, (the striking likeness between Harvey's last name and Martin's initials can't merely be just a coincidence, how many Milks do you know?) and like MLK, MILK too was shot down in his prime with his power to make change and assemble a following so large that it was scary enough to make his political nemesis eat so many Twinkies, as many Twinkies as someone with Josh Brolin's build could eat, that he destroyed the one thing he needed most: MILK.  You see, Harvey Milk had accomplished more in the few years he held local office than most career politicians could hope to accomplish in their entire careers.  And one can only imagine what that would look like, and where the LGBT movement would be, right now, were Harvey Milk alive today?  But aside from the politics and the subject matter, watch Sean Penn give an Academy Award winning performance saying the words of the Academy Award winning screenplay by Dustin Lance Black, being directed by Academy Award nominated Gus Van Sant and acting beside Oscar nominated Josh Brolin, as well as Emile Hirshe, James Franco, Alison Pill, Victor Garber, who are all just as deserving.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 4]","The Mrs. And I viewed ""Milk"" last night and we both liked it, but I think with different degrees of appreciation and for different reasons.We wanted to see all of the films nominated for major Academy Awards before the awards were announced, but we missed ""Doubt"", ""The Wrestler"" and ""Milk"".  We both thought Sean Penn was good in the role of Harvey Milk, but the Mrs. Opined ""I'm not sure he deserved the Oscar... now we have to see The Wrestler. (To see the acclaimed performance of Mickey Roarke)""I'm not so certain, although I'll reserve personal judgment until seeing The Wrestler as well.  About thirty minutes before the ending of Milk I'm watching Sean Penn in a scene wearing a T-Shirt, meeting Denis O'Hare as California State Senator John Briggs.  It occurred to me ""I can hardly believe this is the same actor from Mystic River.  Or Bad Boys.  Or Dead Man Walking.""  You get the idea.  With the same body and face Penn was a completely different person.  The body language and voice even made him appear markedly different. I've seen reviews saying Penn becomes unrecognizable in this role as Harvey Milk.  I was always aware that I was watching Sean Penn - but I saw no flaws in this performance.Penn is ably supported by the almost all-male cast including Josh Brolin as fellow San Francisco Supervisor Dan White, James Franco as lover Scott Smith, Victor Garber as Mayor Moscone and Emile Hirsch as cruiser turned Gay activist Cleve Jones.  Alison Pill has the only significant female role as Anne Kronenberg, a political operative who is brought in after Milk fails a couple of campaigns because she is more macho than Milk's previous inner circle.  She obtains Harvey's first newspaper endorsement - a significant step.I was a child during the time this film was set, and the thought occurred to me ""why should there be a politician whose entire political agenda is based on a non-majority sexual preference?""  Put another way - if a heterosexual person were running for office, would it be pertinent if their entire platform were based on their heterosexuality and their only agenda were the rights of heterosexuals?  The answer, of course, is that no serious political attempts have ever been made to remove the civil rights of heterosexuals.  If politicians are trying to take away your jobs, and even threatening people who support you, you have to fight back.(A side note: I think about the recent avalanche of laws trying to prevent same-sex marriage, and I wonder how far universal civil rights have advanced.  I recently voted against a measure in my home state that passed - defining marriage as only possible between one man and one woman.)We have come, perhaps, a few steps forward.

His story rose above police corruption, homophobic persecution, and political injustice that could not be washed away by the aids outbreak of the proceeding decade, the current denials of gay marriage, and the not so distance accusations of radical ""do-gooders"" like Anita Bryant.While the film contains several somewhat-graphic gay scenes, the focus is on the struggles and growth of an upcoming politician, his supporters, and his rise in popularity.

With Milk, thankfully, it falls into the latter catagory, with a great script, masterful directing, and talented cast, it rises up as possibly one of the greatest film biopics ever.Havery Milk was the first openly gay man to enter public office and is considered an icon in the gay community. What he accomplished in the short span of his politic career could fill volumes. The film begins with Milk recording his life story, from his meeting with longtime lover Scott Smith, to their move to Castro street in '72, his run for office, the numerous people he meets, and of course his untimely death at the hands of a fellow politician.Out of all the award films that I have seen this year, Milk is really the only one that I felt really lived up to all the acclaim. Slumdog was great, so was Benjamin Button and The Dark Knight, The Reader was alright, as was Frost/Nixon, but Milk was truly that one film that really satisfied me. I would gladly say that Milk is hands down the best picture of 2008.Gus Van Sant has made arguably his best film, perfectly balancing all the emotions, sensitivity, and humor that everything just sort of flows across the screen and nothing feels to rushed or to slow. The screenplay by Dustin Lance Black perfectly encapsulates who Milk was as a person, warm, funny, stead fast, someone that you looked up to, no matter if you were gay or straight.The cast, in particular, does a great job, with the obvious standout of course being Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. Now I will admit, I am not a Sean Penn fan. There has just always been something about him that I just did not like. But with this role, he has really turned my opinions on him. The whole time I was watching the film, seeing him gave me nothing but joy, with no animosity or hatred at all felt towards him. He emobied so much of what Harvey Milk was as a person that you cannot believe that this tough as nails actor could play someone so opposite of who he normally potrays. Each of the supporting actors are also great as well, with Emile Hirsh, James Franco, and Josh Brolin being standouts. I will say that I don't agree with Brolin's Oscar nomination. Out of all the supporting roles, I think his is the most underwritten. If it were up to me, Hirsh would get the nomination and not Brolin.This is really a film that everyone should see, no matter what orientation you may be. And in the wakes of the recent Prop 8 vote in California, this film couldn't be even more relevant then ever. If there is any award movie you must see this year, Milk is that film.

1190588,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B001FB55KI,Michael A. Newman,"[1, 2]","I first heard the name Harvey Milk about a few years ago when a new high school for gay teens was being opened in Manhattan and stirred a lot of controversy.  That school was named after Harvey Milk.  The news said that he was an openly gay politician from San Franscisco.I was a little remiss at the time because when I hear somebody mentioned who I know nothing about, I usually research them at a minimum on Wikipedia.  I failed and the name Harvey Milk was filed deep in my brain until this movie starring Sean Penn won critical acclaim and an award for best actor in 2008.  I still failed to do any research.The other night I finally saw this film and it was a fascinating tale.  It shed a lot of light on things that I vaguely heard about but never really thought about.  I remember Anita Bryant from all the orange juice commercials she did but nothing about her crusade against the gay community.  When we look back today, she definately looked ridiculous.  Her time could have been better spent on doing something more productive with her time.The movie explains how the gay movement began in San Francisco, where Harvey Milk opened a shop that catered to a mostly gay clientele.  Pretty soon other gay run shops started opening on his street (Castro) and pretty soon many gays started moving to the area.  Many of them had very sad stories of being abandoned by their families because of their preferences.Eventually Harvey is encouraged to go into politics and crusade for rights to protect people against discrimination based on their sexual orientation.  It is a fascinating study and we also see a lot of the dirty end of politics where favors are bought and traded.

1190592,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001FB55KI,mirasreviews,"[4, 5]","Director Gus Van Sant brings the political career of San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk to the screen in ""Milk"", following Milk from his discovery of political activism at age 40 to his murder in 1978, 8 years later. Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) sporadically narrates the film through a recording which was to be played in the event of his death. He begins with the day he picked up Scott Smith (James Franco) on a New York subway platform. The men became lovers and moved to San Francisco, where they became hippies and opened a camera shop in the Castro district. Milk's successful efforts to mobilize the gay community into an economic and political force didn't translate into successful runs for public office -until redistricting and a new campaign manager gave him a better shot.Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States (there was one lesbian who preceded him). His political activism in San Francisco came at a time of violent clashes between police and gay citizens, who could genuinely claim that they were being persecuted and feared for their physical safety. It was also a time of social upheaval and political unrest due, in part, to the stagnant economy of the 1970s. A man could grow a ponytail in middle age, stand on a box on a street corner, and try to make a cohesive community out of a diffuse group of people who normally preferred to hide their identities. Harvey Milk created the ""gay community"", and his charisma and tireless activism turned them into a political force that spearheaded the campaign against California's Briggs Initiative.Other powerful gays in San Francisco presented themselves as ordinary citizens who happened to be gay, with the idea that that was a more inclusive image and smarter politics. Milk was more hot-headed and had a feel for the times. He would make the gay community a self-identified socio-political faction. Of course, there is the possibility that emphasizing their differences instead of their commonality with the average San Franciscan would ultimately be alienating. It makes me wonder how Milk, who openly approved of the pick-up culture, would have coped with the AIDS crisis had he lived to see it. Harvey Milk had his own way of doing politics, which ""Milk"" presents as heroic. That's not indisputable, but it was certainly effective, and Sean Penn's performance really conveys Milk's passion and charm.The DVD (Universal 2009): Bonus features are 3 featurettes and some deleted scenes. ""Remembering Harvey"" (13 min) interviews people who knew Milk, many of whom are represented in the film, about their memory of him, his death, and his legacy. In ""Hollywood Comes to San Francisco"" (14 min), the screenwriter, producers, and cast talk about making the movie and their characters. ""Marching for Equality"" (8 min) interviews Cleve Jones and others who participated in several real marches in San Francisco that were recreated for the film.

For the past 10 years, this would probably be Sean Penn.  With classics such as 21 Grams, Mystic River, and now Milk, Sean Penn has progressed far from his bad boy days and is now one of the best American actors.  Milk is Penn's portrayal of the political career of Harvey Milk, one of the first openly gay men elected to public office in the USA.  Starting in NYC and ending in the Bay Area around San Francisco, this movie shows how the closeted gay Mr. Milk became openly gay, and then a gay rights crusader who took on big political honchos in California and the US national scene.  All the major characters from Milk's later life are included in this movie, though the movie does not mention anything about his family.

Bens, Jr.","[16, 22]","Milk is a reverential and loving portrayal of the Mayor of Castro Street, the late Harvey Milk, a man who was indeed both a product of his time and a man ahead of his time. And perhaps in this reverence we find the greatest flaw of the movie.Sean Penn certainly deserved the Oscar as it is a nuanced performance, though I can't say that the screenplay deserved the accolades it has received. Likewise I don't understand why Josh Brolin was nominated as it was a spectacularly un-memorable and one-note performance (due, in large part, to it being written that way.)  Emile Hirsch and James Franco (the latter being someone I don't really care for) were excellent.Perhaps the main problem I had with the film is that Milk himself was portrayed rather saintly, so as far as a representation of the man, I thought it was written rather one-dimensionally.  And knowing a bit of his biography, he wasn't as saintly as he was portrayed.  Certainly he did many good things, but the film seems to focus solely on that and not other aspects of his personality.  In all, this was probably expected considering that to the screenwriter, Milk was nearly a patron saint.  Still, it would have been nice to see more dimensionality.  Had they delved more into the relationship between Milk and the ""A-gays"" I think we would have seen that more.  Also, if we'd seen more of the political maneuverings, we would have seen a more rounded, more real-person Milk.Another problem I had was that there was, apparently, only one lesbian in San Francisco.  Where were all the Lesbians?  Likewise, there were two Asian guys and one off-balance Latino guy in San Francisco.  Even the ""extras"" were peopled with mostly white people.  Yes, I know that Milk's inner circle was primarily white guys, but people of color were instrumental during that fight and it really bothered me that in a story set in one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the country, during a battle in which people of color were instrumental, it all comes of rather...white.  Even the city itself comes off rather white.  This as well was a big problem for me.As a piece of film making, Milk works and it is well enough crafted.  As a piece of gay film making, it does a pretty nice job of giving a positive portrayal of gay men, something sorely lacking in mainstream films.  They just missed some dimensionality, the gay women and the people of color, and those omissions, to me, were major, major faults with the film.Not brilliant, Milk is certainly a film worth watching for both its artistic value and for documenting a time which was an important milestone in American history.",3,Reverential but Flawed,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,2634,"['Milk', 'reverential', 'loving', 'portrayal', 'Mayor', 'Castro', 'Street', 'late', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'indeed', 'product', 'time', 'man', 'ahead', 'time', 'perhaps', 'reverence', 'find', 'greatest', 'flaw', 'movie.Sean', 'Penn', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'screenplay', 'deserved', 'accolades', 'received', 'Likewise', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'was', 'nominated', 'was', 'spectacularly', 'un-memorable', 'one-note', 'performance', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'being', 'written', 'way', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'James', 'Franco', 'latter', 'being', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'were', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'Milk', 'was', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'saintly', 'so', 'as', 'far', 'representation', 'man', 'thought', 'was', 'written', 'rather', 'one-dimensionally', 'knowing', 'bit', 'biography', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'saintly', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Certainly', 'did', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'focus', 'solely', 'not', 'other', 'aspects', 'personality', 'was', 'probably', 'expected', 'considering', 'screenwriter', 'Milk', 'was', 'nearly', 'patron', 'saint', 'Still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'dimensionality', 'Had', 'delved', 'more', 'relationship', 'Milk', 'A-gays', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Also', ""'d"", 'seen', 'more', 'political', 'maneuverings', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'rounded', 'more', 'real-person', 'Milk.Another', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'was', 'apparently', 'only', 'one', 'lesbian', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Where', 'were', 'Lesbians', 'Likewise', 'were', 'two', 'Asian', 'guys', 'one', 'off-balance', 'Latino', 'guy', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Even', 'extras', 'were', 'peopled', 'mostly', 'white', 'people', 'Yes', 'know', 'Milk', 'inner', 'circle', 'was', 'primarily', 'white', 'guys', 'people', 'color', 'were', 'instrumental', 'fight', 'really', 'bothered', 'story', 'set', 'one', 'most', 'ethnically', 'diverse', 'cities', 'country', 'battle', 'people', 'color', 'were', 'instrumental', 'rather', 'white', 'Even', 'city', 'rather', 'white', 'well', 'was', 'big', 'problem', 'me.As', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'Milk', 'well', 'enough', 'crafted', 'piece', 'gay', 'film', 'making', 'pretty', 'nice', 'job', 'giving', 'positive', 'portrayal', 'gay', 'men', 'something', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'mainstream', 'films', 'just', 'missed', 'dimensionality', 'gay', 'women', 'people', 'color', 'omissions', 'were', 'major', 'major', 'faults', 'film.Not', 'brilliant', 'Milk', 'certainly', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'artistic', 'value', 'documenting', 'time', 'was', 'important', 'milestone', 'American', 'history']",Milk

I think it pulled no punches. I am amazed at how Sean Penn was able to transform himself into a gay man - even the look it is eyes. It is amazing. The acting was superb. The story was difficult. I am not truly ""liberated"" on this subject and the movie confirmed many of my predjudices.

1190619,A1OKYEKK5VE8VG,B001FB55KI,Richard Steiger,"[6, 15]","My main reaction to this film was, ""Why bother?""  I mean, the story has already been told in the vastly superior documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" and even in a good made-for-tv movie with Peter Coyote and Tim Daly.  So why do it again when you have absolutely nothing to add except cliches that were thrice-familiar seventy years ago?(For a far superior biopic, try ""Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet""-1940,I believe)  I suppose the main problem with this dreary effort is its lack of focus.  In the space of about two hours the movie tries a little bit of everything-a little social background, a little of the political infighting in San Francisco, a little of Harvey Milk's love life, a little of Dan White's anger, etc.  The made-for-tv movie was far more detailed and nuanced.  I have to say, though, that this movie has the feel of a made-for-tv movie, complete with titles telling us, like a Dickens novel, what happened to all the characters later on.  In fact I found myself disappointed by the lack of commercials, which any decent made-for-tv movie ought by rights to have. The most interesting thing about the movie is its desperate attempt to create emotional impact from a story whose time has, frankly, come and gone.  Let's face it, the main political issue these days seems to be the technical distinction between a civil union and a marriage, hardly the stuff of life and death, as it once was.  And so the movie gives us scene after scene of the Great Uplift.  By the time the movie was over I half expected to see kids playing basketball in a schoolyard shouting, ""I'm Harvey Milk.""  ""No, I'm Harvey Milk"" in the manner of another dreary biopic.  The movie even resorts (so help me) to a gay boy in a wheelchair who is about to be taken to an asylum to be fixed in some unidentified way!  All that was missing was his rescue from a fire by Lassie.  So, as I said at the beginning, why bother?

1190622,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001FB55KI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 5]","Milk (Gus van Sant, 2008)When I started watching Milk, Gus van Sant's biopic of San Francisco city supervisor, I wasn't quite sure about it. The film opens with Milk (Sean Penn) dictating, essentially, his memoirs onto a series of cassettes in case he is assassinated. I wasn't quite sure how van Sant was going to work the time factor into this (given how the movie ends--and we all know how it ends, right? If not, be warned, this review may contain spoilers), but he ended up doing it quite well. One can never be quite sure what one is going to get with a Gus van Sant film, but Milk is far closer on the sliding scale of quality to Drugstore Cowboy than it is to Psycho. (And as Captain Peacock was wont to say, ""Thank Heaven for that."")The first half of Milk traces the final years of Harvey Milk's life, from his relocation to San Francisco with partner Scott Smith (An American Crime's James Franco) through his days as a political activist to his election as city supervisor. The second half zeroes in on the final weeks, as Milk tries to play politics with rabid antigay conservative Dan White (No Country for Old Men's Josh Brolin), elected supervisor for the next district over on the same day Milk rose to power. Along the way, we get to know the backstories of a number of others instrumental in Milk's rise to power, including Cleve Jones (Speed Racer's Emile Hirsch), who would go on to create the AIDS quilt; Jack Lira (Y Tu Mama Tambien's Diego Luna), whom Milk dated after Smith left him (and who was, in many ways, the impetus for the events of Milk's final days); and Anne Kronenberg (Allison Pill, recently fo Dan in Real Life), who is still involved in San Francisco politics to this day.While the movie does have a plot (and a more compelling plot than a lot of recent movies not based on true stories), it never fails to remain aggressively character-driven, and because of that the movie lives or dies by the performances of the actors involved. Every time I've seen Sean Penn offscreen for the past decade or so, he seems more and more like a personal train wreck (his Oscar speech accepting the Best Actor award for this film was horrifyingly incoherent), but it's been impossible to deny his power as an actor for close to thirty years now. I've loved many of Penn's performances, from Fast Times at Ridgemont High to Mystic River, but for me his landmark performance has always been in the 1983 prison drama Bad Boys. This is the first time I've seen him eclipse that. He absolutely, positively nails this role to the wall. On the flip side of the coin is Josh Brolin, whose career has been the polar opposite of Penn's, from the woeful The Goonies through some of Hollywood's worst disasters in recent memory (Hollow Man, The Mod Squad, Into the Blue). No Country for Old Men was a revelation where Brolin was concerned, and Milk just ups the ante. While saying Brolin has never given a performance this good would be damning with faint praise, I don't mean it like that at all; he is almost as powerful as Penn here. The rest of the principals are equally good at making us love or hate them, depending (Diego Luna is just loathsome here, as he was meant to be). The main cast are helped out by a slew of phenomenal performances from actors in minor roles; 21 Grams' Dennis O'Hara reunites with Penn here as John Briggs, Milk's biggest public nemesis, while Legally Blonde's Victor Garber couldn't be better as George Moscone, the mayor of San Francisco. And they're just the tip of the iceberg; this isn't Cecil B. DeMille, but it's at least a cast of hundreds, and everyone with a speaking role is fine here.The direction is equally stunning. Van Sant's passion for the source material is evident in every frame (he's been trying to get an adaptation of Randy Shilts' biography, The Mayor of Castro Street, off the ground for almost twenty years; it looks as if that may actually happen now). People often say that attention to small details doesn't make a difference in a movie. Maybe in some cases they're right, but I think in this case it's indicative of Van Sant's dedication to the source material; his use, for example, of the real Castro Camera and Harvey Milk's actual apartment may only contribute to the film in an intangible way, but I think those intangibles are reflected in the performances of the actors. (As well, a number of the actual people portrayed in the film have cameos, including Dan White's son Chris, Cleve Jones, and Danny Nicoletta). That has to have some effect on what happens behind the scenes, don't you think? In any case, it's hard to argue with success, and whatever the reason, Milk gives us both a director and a stable of actors who are all on top of their collective game here. Almost unanimously named by critics as one of the best movies of 2008, and I'm inclined to agree. ****",4,van Sant gets a year's supply of free cookies for this one.,1263513600,"01 15,

1190625,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001FB55KI,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","How fortuitous a thing is timing.  Released only a few weeks after the passage of Proposition 8 - a ballot measure that took away the rights of same-sex couples to marry in California - Gus Van Sant's Oscar-nominated film ""Milk"" turns back the clock to another, similar struggle in American civil rights history and to the iconic figure who most helped to wage it.Harvey Milk was, of course, the San Francisco supervisor and gay-rights pioneer who, along with Mayor George Moscone, was gunned down in city hall in November 1978. The perpetrator, Dan White, a disgruntled fellow board member who had recently resigned his seat, was found guilty of manslaughter (using the now infamous ""Twinkie Defense"" to get the lower charge), sent to prison for a mere five years, then released in 1984, only to take his own life two years later.Dustin Lance Black's Oscar-winning screenplay traces Milk's meteoric rise from an obscure, still largely closeted Republican businessman in the early 1970s to the de facto leader of the gay-rights movement that began to take shape during that decade.  He became the first openly gay man in the state to be elected to public office and, in 1978, he was instrumental in helping to defeat Proposition 6, which, if passed, would have made it illegal for homosexuals - and even straight supporters of homosexuals! - to teach in California public schools (could this really have been only thirty years ago?).  Throughout all this, Milk managed to develop a large, highly charged grass roots organization, the purpose of which was not merely to combat bigotry wherever it reared its ugly head but to win over the hearts and minds of the people in their own community and the nation as a whole.There has been some criticism leveled against the movie that it is too reverential in its treatment of Milk, that it paints him too much as a saint and not enough as an ordinary human being with the requisite number of weaknesses and flaws to make him truly viable as a character.  Even if one were to accept that charge (which I do not), it still doesn't take into account the very special quality that Sean Penn himself brings to the role.  With obviously heightened mannerisms that he is careful never to allow to slide over into caricature or camp, Penn makes Milk both charismatically larger-than-life and recognizably human at one and the same time.  Whether he's in front of a crowd rallying the troops with his megaphone or enjoying a tender moment with his longtime boyfriend, Scott Smith, Penn allows us to see the many facets of this obviously complex man.In a movie chock full of outstanding supporting performances, James Franco as Smith, Josh Brolin as Dan White, and Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, a rootless young man inspired by Milk to become a lifelong activist, are the obvious standouts.As a director, Van Sant keeps things moving at an almost whirlwind pace, beautifully balancing the ""big"" scenes of rallies and marches with the more intimate moments depicting Milk's relationships with those around him.  At times Van Sant brings an almost documentary-style immediacy to the film, seamlessly blending actual footage from that era (much of it of Anita Bryant and her anti-gay crusade) with convincingly staged re-enactments of events at that time.  Obviously wanting to end on a positive note, the movie mentions but does not dramatize the ""White Night Riots"" which took place in the city following the assassinations, instead focusing on the enormous candlelight march that wended its way through the shocked and devastated city.  Thus, the ending, like the movie itself, is a necessary and deeply moving reminder of how the courage of one individual to stand up for what he knows is right can inspire others to follow in his footsteps - and change the world in the process.By opening with file footage of men being arrested at a gay bar then carted off in paddy wagons to be booked as ""sex offenders,"" ""Milk"" makes the viewer realize how very far society has come in the time since the events depicted in this story - and, with the recent passage of Proposition 8, how very far it still has to go.",5,a timely and inspiring biopic,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,4137,"['How', 'fortuitous', 'thing', 'timing', 'Released', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'passage', 'Proposition', '8', 'ballot', 'measure', 'took', 'away', 'rights', 'same-sex', 'couples', 'marry', 'California', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Oscar-nominated', 'film', 'Milk', 'back', 'clock', 'similar', 'struggle', 'American', 'civil', 'rights', 'history', 'iconic', 'figure', 'who', 'most', 'helped', 'wage', 'it.Harvey', 'Milk', 'was', 'course', 'San', 'Francisco', 'supervisor', 'gay-rights', 'pioneer', 'who', 'Mayor', 'George', 'Moscone', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'city', 'hall', 'November', '1978', 'perpetrator', 'Dan', 'White', 'disgruntled', 'fellow', 'board', 'member', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'resigned', 'seat', 'was', 'found', 'guilty', 'manslaughter', 'using', 'now', 'infamous', 'Twinkie', 'Defense', 'get', 'lower', 'charge', 'sent', 'prison', 'mere', 'five', 'years', 'then', 'released', '1984', 'only', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'two', 'years', 'later.Dustin', 'Lance', 'Black', 'Oscar-winning', 'screenplay', 'traces', 'Milk', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'obscure', 'still', 'largely', 'closeted', 'Republican', 'businessman', 'early', '1970s', 'de', 'facto', 'leader', 'gay-rights', 'movement', 'began', 'take', 'shape', 'decade', 'became', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'state', 'be', 'elected', 'public', 'office', '1978', 'was', 'instrumental', 'helping', 'defeat', 'Proposition', '6', 'passed', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'illegal', 'homosexuals', 'even', 'straight', 'supporters', 'homosexuals', 'teach', 'California', 'public', 'schools', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'Milk', 'managed', 'develop', 'large', 'highly', 'charged', 'grass', 'roots', 'organization', 'purpose', 'was', 'not', 'merely', 'combat', 'bigotry', 'reared', 'ugly', 'head', 'win', 'hearts', 'minds', 'people', 'own', 'community', 'nation', 'whole.There', 'been', 'criticism', 'leveled', 'movie', 'too', 'reverential', 'treatment', 'Milk', 'too', 'much', 'saint', 'not', 'enough', 'ordinary', 'human', 'being', 'requisite', 'number', 'weaknesses', 'flaws', 'make', 'truly', 'viable', 'character', 'Even', 'one', 'were', 'accept', 'charge', 'do', 'not', 'still', ""n't"", 'take', 'account', 'very', 'special', 'quality', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'role', 'obviously', 'heightened', 'mannerisms', 'careful', 'never', 'allow', 'slide', 'caricature', 'camp', 'Penn', 'Milk', 'charismatically', 'larger-than-life', 'recognizably', 'human', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'front', 'crowd', 'rallying', 'troops', 'megaphone', 'enjoying', 'tender', 'moment', 'longtime', 'boyfriend', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'Penn', 'see', 'many', 'facets', 'obviously', 'complex', 'man.In', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'performances', 'James', 'Franco', 'Smith', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Dan', 'White', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Cleve', 'Jones', 'rootless', 'young', 'man', 'inspired', 'Milk', 'become', 'lifelong', 'activist', 'are', 'obvious', 'standouts.As', 'director', 'Van', 'Sant', 'things', 'moving', 'almost', 'whirlwind', 'pace', 'beautifully', 'balancing', 'big', 'scenes', 'rallies', 'marches', 'more', 'intimate', 'moments', 'depicting', 'Milk', 'relationships', 'times', 'Van', 'Sant', 'almost', 'documentary-style', 'immediacy', 'film', 'seamlessly', 'blending', 'actual', 'footage', 'era', 'much', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'anti-gay', 'crusade', 'convincingly', 'staged', 're-enactments', 'events', 'time', 'Obviously', 'wanting', 'end', 'positive', 'note', 'movie', 'mentions', 'not', 'dramatize', 'White', 'Night', 'Riots', 'took', 'place', 'city', 'following', 'assassinations', 'instead', 'focusing', 'enormous', 'candlelight', 'march', 'wended', 'way', 'shocked', 'devastated', 'city', 'Thus', 'ending', 'movie', 'necessary', 'deeply', 'moving', 'reminder', 'how', 'courage', 'one', 'individual', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'can', 'inspire', 'others', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'change', 'world', 'process.By', 'opening', 'file', 'footage', 'men', 'being', 'arrested', 'gay', 'bar', 'then', 'carted', 'off', 'paddy', 'wagons', 'be', 'booked', 'sex', 'offenders', 'Milk', 'viewer', 'realize', 'how', 'very', 'far', 'society', 'come', 'time', 'events', 'depicted', 'story', 'recent', 'passage', 'Proposition', '8', 'how', 'very', 'far', 'still', 'go']",Milk

He, unfortunately, may have not lived long enough to see the revolution he started, but in can be certain that his name (along with the mayor who was also a martyr for the cause) will be written in stone for years to come. I notice some people (or rather ""person"") were complaing about Sean Pean's acting and that he didn't deserve the Oscar. Like most people, I think that's far from the truth. Sean Pean has a gift of totally immersing himself into character - a talent that a lot of actors/actresses fail at (I'm not going to name names . . .). Penn was excellent as Sam in ""I am Sam"" and even better as Jimmy Markum in Mystic River (one of my favourite movies of ALL time!). It's nice to see someone getting credit rather than stereotypical actors such as *cough*BradPitt*cough* and such . . .

Even if some ignorant pinhead writes something predictable such as ""Sean Penn is a traitor"" or ""Hollywood is shoving the gay lifestyle down our throats"" or ""this goes against American values"" there is such a thing as freedom of speech and even the simple minded have a right to be heard.That being said ""Milk"", the latest movie by gifted director Gus Van Sant, is a success in every way.  The movie tells the story of Harvey Milk, a man who ran for San Fransisco city supervisor several times, and lost, but eventually won an election in 1978.  The reason why this was such a controversial election, of course was that Harvey Milk was a gay man who made no apologies for his sexual orientation.  Although Milk is by no means a perfect human being he fights of challenges from the religious and conservative right who believed homosexuals were deviants and should not be allowed to be school teachers or belong in a 'civilized' society.Harvey Milk is presented not as a man who is trying to shove anything in anyone's face, but as a man who is sick of being told there is something wrong with him and who wants the freedom to live without being told he is sick or he has some disease.They key to the movie's greatness is, of course, Sean Penn's performance as Milk.  Never once did I think I was watching Sean Penn pretend to be Harvey Milk.  I was watching Harvey Milk the entire time.  The key to a great performance is when you can forget this is an actor playing a character, the rest of the cast, including James Franco and Josh Brolin, also do an outstanding job.""Milk"" is not gay cinema.

Milk's persona, then, is personalized not as a revered martyr but as a living, breathing person. The character's struggles and hardships to bring equal treatment for gays and lesbians are emphasized through Van Sant's admirable humanistic treatment. There are some cheeky, comical and aloof scenes, especially the ones that do not skim through the naked fit body of James Franco, and the lens view them with a sneaky and cheeky voyeuristic glances, but that is through Van Sant's aesthetic sensibilities, one of the encompassing elements of his rather seemingly cold, objective trademark direction, which is just perfect for this type of a film: bringing journalistic truth without compromising artistic visions. The heartbreaking scenes sneak up on the viewer with gut wrenching objectivity: the suicide is a shocker and heart-wrenching and the ending is an absolute tragedy, though at the same time, highly optimistic and hopeful.

However, he finds that he's quickly gaining support of the local gay community, and that the number of votes he's receiving during each election is on the rise.Finally, he wins the position of City Supervisor, and Milk finds himself in the middle of every cause he can think of...not just the rights of gays, but any discrimination that exists whether it be due to color, age, or race.Granted, each battle seems to be an uphill one, but Milk is filled with a resolve, and he won't quit, even when his partner, Scott, has had enough and leaves him.The pinnacle part of the film is Milk battling against Proposition 6, which repeals many rights for gay people.  He challenges his rival, Senator Briggs who feels that gay people shouldn't have any rights at all, and is even on a crusade to expose each and every one of them.  Milk holds several memorable and poignant debates with the senator throughout the state of California.I've always found it interesting that when there is a cause to fight for, a champion comes along to spear-head it.  Milk is that champion for gay people, even though he's actually fighting against all forms of discrimination.The movie is narrated by Milk who is recording his life story on tape, already seeming to sense that he won't be around much longer.  Ironically, Milk tells Scott that he doesn't feel that he'll live to be 50.There are great performances all around in this film, not only by Sean Penn, but also by James Franco (Scott), Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, and Josh Brolin.  Brolin plays Dan White, a fellow City Supervisor and the instrument of Milk's death.  What I didn't forsee, was that Milk's assassination was politically motivated as White had lost his job and felt that Milk and the Mayor were responsible, rather than it being a hate crime against Milk's sexual orientation.What I enjoyed about the movie was that it focused on Milk's cause.  People who might be uncomfortable about the possibility of sexual scenes needn't worry.  The movie isn't ""in your face"" and nothing is depicted really, beyond some kissing. (Course, if that bothers you than you may want to take a pass on this film.)Gus Van Sant is a terrific director; one who brought us great films like ""Good Will Hunting,"" and ""Milk"" is another testament to his abilities as a director.There are some movies that are simply important to watch, because they give us a sense of where we came from, where we are going, and how important it is to be tolerant and accepting of people, regardless of their differences.  ""Milk"" is such a film.",5,Sean Penn Paves the Way In This Powerful Film,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,3640,"['Well', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'why', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'took', 'home', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'year', 'performance', 'Milk', 'was', 'incredible', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'who', 'totally', 'parts', 'much', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'been', 'doing', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'Even', 'fellow', 'actors', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'said', 'was', 'character', 'Jeff', 'Spiccoli', 'entire', 'shoot.I', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'time', 'events', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'learning', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'influence', 'had', 'San', 'Francisco', 'poltics', 'California', 'politics', 'even', 'influences', 'had', 'nationally', 'as', 'well', 'Milk', 'story', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'gay', 'man', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'time', 'change', 'just', 'met', 'new', 'love', 'interst', 'Scott', 'whom', 'keep', 'lid', 'relationship', 'move', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Milk', 'quickly', 'order', 'effect', 'changes', 'see', 'can', 'stay', 'closet', 'longer.He', 'City', 'Supervisor', 'several', 'times', 'only', 'lose', 'time', 'However', 'quickly', 'gaining', 'support', 'local', 'gay', 'community', 'number', 'votes', 'receiving', 'election', 'rise.Finally', 'position', 'City', 'Supervisor', 'Milk', 'middle', 'cause', 'can', 'think', 'not', 'just', 'rights', 'gays', 'discrimination', 'be', 'due', 'color', 'age', 'race.Granted', 'battle', 'be', 'uphill', 'one', 'Milk', 'filled', 'resolve', 'wo', ""n't"", 'quit', 'even', 'when', 'partner', 'Scott', 'had', 'enough', 'him.The', 'pinnacle', 'part', 'film', 'Milk', 'battling', 'Proposition', '6', 'many', 'rights', 'gay', 'people', 'rival', 'Senator', 'Briggs', 'who', 'gay', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'rights', 'even', 'crusade', 'expose', 'one', 'Milk', 'several', 'memorable', 'poignant', 'debates', 'senator', 'state', 'California.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'interesting', 'when', 'cause', 'fight', 'champion', 'along', 'spear-head', 'Milk', 'champion', 'gay', 'people', 'even', 'actually', 'fighting', 'forms', 'discrimination.The', 'movie', 'narrated', 'Milk', 'who', 'recording', 'life', 'story', 'tape', 'already', 'seeming', 'sense', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'around', 'much', 'longer', 'Ironically', 'Milk', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ll"", 'live', 'be', '50.There', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'around', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'also', 'James', 'Franco', 'Scott', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Brolin', 'Dan', 'White', 'fellow', 'City', 'Supervisor', 'instrument', 'Milk', 'death', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'forsee', 'was', 'Milk', 'assassination', 'was', 'politically', 'motivated', 'White', 'had', 'lost', 'job', 'felt', 'Milk', 'Mayor', 'were', 'responsible', 'rather', 'being', 'hate', 'crime', 'Milk', 'sexual', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'focused', 'Milk', 'cause', 'People', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'possibility', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'need', ""n't"", 'worry', 'movie', ""n't"", 'face', 'nothing', 'depicted', 'really', 'kissing', 'Course', 'may', 'want', 'take', 'pass', 'film', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'terrific', 'director', 'one', 'who', 'brought', 'great', 'films', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Milk', 'testament', 'abilities', 'director.There', 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'simply', 'important', 'watch', 'give', 'sense', 'where', 'came', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'how', 'important', 'be', 'tolerant', 'accepting', 'people', 'regardless', 'differences', 'Milk', 'film']",Milk

Gus Van Zant does a fantastic job getting a spectacular performance out of the singular Sean Penn and I applaud the man in full disection of Milk.  The film has a nice pace and show's how this mild mannered, East Coast Jew, hardly the sterotype of the stylish, WASP, that most think of when they think of gays, took San Francisco by storm.  I thought Van Zant being gay, really got to the heart of what made Milk tick, and I thought Penn's relationship with Franco in the movie felt genuine, not contrived, like Hanks relationship with Banderas in Philadelphia, though like Hanks and Banderas you wonder, in what gay planet would these people every be together, but I digress.

Everything about this film was fantastic, except that it could have been about half an hour shorter and been even more stellar.

It was interesting to see San Francisco presented in a light progressed beyond the idealistic haze of the 60s, yet not having quite reached its hippie goals.  The cultural transition presented in the wider picture of this film is as extraordinary as the depiction of Milk's life.  While Penn is a great actor, I did find that some of the mannerisms he fused into Milk were ones I've seen him do with other characters.  This distracted my spell several times, but his ability to express the gentle kindness of Milk at any given point made up for the unoriginality of physicality.  The film is, of course, terribly sad, for far more reasons than the obvious untimely demise of Milk.  The personal drama that he gave himself over to in creating this revolution is well documented.

Set in the seventies this film explores gay rights issues in San Francisco and America in general and the opposition Milk experienced to his candidacy and the issues he fought for. With a great cast and another amazing performance from Sean Penn, this film quickly draws you in and keeps you watching until the shattering conclusion. Penn's acting seems to get better with each film he makes and from once being the bad boy of Hollywood he is now a credible and highly respected actor/director and rightly so in my opinion. This also has note worthy performances from Emile Hirsh and Josh Brolin. Milk's development from Haight area hippy to vocal activist and politician is shown excellently and makes for fascinating viewing even if you aren't interested in politics or gay rights issues.

1190640,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B001FB55KI,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[1, 3]","Harvey Milk was a hero, for both the gay and civil rights movements. As an African American lesbian, I thought that Harvey Milk's progressive political stance, was particularly relevant to those like me. He was willing to put everything on the line, to fight for all oppressed people. It seemed to me that when Milk was fighting for justice in the 70s and 80s, politicians were way more committed to their constituents, than they are today. This was certainly the case, with the political activism of Harvey Milk.Harvey Milk let nothing stand in his way, in his pursuit of his ideals. We desperately need more politicians like him, in our very troubled era. Rights for minorities, gay and lesbians, women, working people, etc., have been under attack by the right-wing political machine, in recent years. The time is right, for another progressive leader, to take a serious stand on civil rights for all, like Harvey Milk had the courage to do when he was alive.Sean Penn's performance as Harvey Milk, is a prime example of his superb talent as an actor. Penn shows a real finesse, for conveying Harvey Milk's mannerisms, passionate political convictions, and dedication to the cause for justice, for the underdogs in society.Josh Brolin as Dan White, turns in a muted, yet deeply resonate performance. Though not as marvelously talented as Sean Penn, Brolin has a terse, brooding charisma, that can't be ignored.Harvey Milk was a bold, brave man, who deserves to be remembered as such.

I knew Harvey, and at times I had to remind myself I was looking at Sean Penn in excellent makeup rather than at Harvey himself. I met Harvey when I was in my early 20s, before he immersed himself in politics; I lived in the Castro and frequently ran into him at Toad Hall (mentioned & recreated to some extent in the film) fairly often, although I barely recall his camera shop. I watched the Castro change and Harvey repeatedly fail in his bids for City Supervisor. And I can never forget the day he won, the shock I felt when I heard Supervisor Feinstein announce on TV that the Mayor and Harvey had been murdered at City Hall, the subsequent trial of Dan White, and the riot that transpired as a gut reaction to the verdict. This film recreates all of these events and times to an amazing degree of accuracy. I caught myself looking at crowd scenes, half expecting to see my young face flash by.This is a very important film! One reviewer at Netflix said it was more of an excuse to show two men kissing than anything else. That's bologna! The director handled the brief and extremely tame sex scenes (NONE of which were enough to offend anyone, in my estimation; nudity in the film only consists of one brief shot of a naked male in a swimming pool, his butt shown for about 5 seconds under water and from a bird's eye view) cleverly and tastefully.I wasn't a close friend of Harvey's by any means, but he had very unique ways of speaking, talking and flirting, all of which Sean Penn recreated to great effect.The film gave me more insight into Harvey's personal life both in NYC and in San Francisco; I didn't know too much about that, although I saw Scott a few times. As stated in the film, he wasn't a saint by any means (he could be downright irritating and persistent in his advances when he'd had too much to drink, and that's based on personal experience), but he was a regular, even ""normal"" man who was in the right place at the right time with the courage to do what he deeply believed had to be done to save innumerable lives and change even more minds. One could easily compare him to Martin Luther King, whom I feel sure would have admired Harvey as much as Harvey admired Rev. King.More people should see this film for its historical accuracy, fantastic script, direction and performances.

Sean Penn plays a very good Harvey Milk. Harvey Milk was a very charismatic and intelligent gay rights advocate. James Franco plays Scott, someone who was very much loved by Harvey. They both move together to San Francisco, where Harvey goes on to have his political career. Harvey Milk becomes the first openly gay man to be elected in office. The movie chronicles some of the other battles that Harvey must face when he gets elected. However, I enjoyed how the movie showed him displaying persistence, courage, and self-confidence even in the face of obstacles. Josh Brolin plays Harvey's political rival Dan White (in real life Dan White is responsible for his murder). There are going to be various elements that catch an individual's attention depending on who they are. What caught my attention was how Harvey Milk is portrayed as one who is the rescuer.  Obviously, this at times served him well to have a good heart because he was well loved by many people.  The movie shows how he would come to the ""rescue"" of the two lovers that are portrayed in the movie (Scott Smith and Jack Lira)in a compassionate and caring way.  First off, let me say that I think that it was a good thing that he had a big heart. It served him in a positive way on how he connected to people from all walks of life. However, the movie does portray that it was his rescuing personality that may have cost him his life.  This is due to the fact that the movie shows how one of Harvey's campaign workers warns him about being too close to Dan White. Harvey understands this concern of the campaign worker, but he implies why Dan could benefit from his help.  Then the campaign worker rightfully points up that he is big on being the rescuer, and seems to drop hints to Harvey to be careful.  Sean Penn played the role of Harvey Milk so well that it really felt like I was getting a historic glimpse on what it might have felt like for Harvey Milk and for those that were the closest to him and helping him out.  I normally love and prefer to watch only cheerful feel good movies.  However, this movie pulled at my heartstrings because a very powerful, caring, and intelligent man was taken at such a stage in his life where he was just starting to reap the benefits of his hard work.  Aside from this caveat, I still feel that this was a terrific movie with some convincing and talented actors and actresses, with my favorite two being Sean Penn and James Franco.",5,A Controversial but Wonderful Masterpiece,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,2551,"['very', 'dramatic', 'heartwrenching', 'movie', 'watch', 'great', 'one', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'very', 'good', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'was', 'very', 'charismatic', 'intelligent', 'gay', 'rights', 'advocate', 'James', 'Franco', 'Scott', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'loved', 'Harvey', 'move', 'together', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'Harvey', 'have', 'political', 'career', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'be', 'elected', 'office', 'movie', 'other', 'battles', 'Harvey', 'must', 'face', 'when', 'elected', 'However', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'movie', 'showed', 'displaying', 'persistence', 'courage', 'self-confidence', 'even', 'face', 'obstacles', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Harvey', 'political', 'rival', 'Dan', 'White', 'real', 'life', 'Dan', 'White', 'responsible', 'murder', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'various', 'elements', 'catch', 'individual', 'attention', 'depending', 'who', 'are', 'What', 'caught', 'attention', 'was', 'how', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'portrayed', 'one', 'who', 'rescuer', 'Obviously', 'times', 'served', 'well', 'have', 'good', 'heart', 'was', 'well', 'loved', 'many', 'people', 'movie', 'how', 'would', 'come', 'rescue', 'two', 'lovers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'Jack', 'Lira', 'compassionate', 'caring', 'way', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'had', 'big', 'heart', 'served', 'positive', 'way', 'how', 'connected', 'people', 'walks', 'life', 'However', 'movie', 'portray', 'was', 'rescuing', 'personality', 'may', 'have', 'cost', 'life', 'due', 'fact', 'movie', 'how', 'one', 'Harvey', 'campaign', 'workers', 'being', 'too', 'close', 'Dan', 'White', 'Harvey', 'concern', 'campaign', 'worker', 'why', 'Dan', 'could', 'benefit', 'help', 'Then', 'campaign', 'worker', 'rightfully', 'up', 'big', 'being', 'rescuer', 'drop', 'hints', 'Harvey', 'be', 'careful', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'played', 'role', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'so', 'well', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'getting', 'historic', 'glimpse', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'felt', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'were', 'closest', 'helping', 'normally', 'love', 'prefer', 'watch', 'only', 'cheerful', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'However', 'movie', 'pulled', 'heartstrings', 'very', 'powerful', 'caring', 'intelligent', 'man', 'was', 'taken', 'stage', 'life', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'reap', 'benefits', 'hard', 'work', 'Aside', 'caveat', 'still', 'feel', 'was', 'terrific', 'movie', 'convincing', 'talented', 'actors', 'actresses', 'favorite', 'two', 'being', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'James', 'Franco']",Milk

While watching the picture ones get a glimpse as to what gay people went through, back in the 1970's, as far as recognition and respect is concerned. If we think things are tough now, the world was more difficult 30 years ago.Sean Penn plays Harvery Milk, who was the first openly gay person who held a position in public office in the history of the United States. He was on the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco, and he was determined gay men and women would obtain the same rights as heterosexuals. Harvey  was not only a gay hero, but a hero for all those who didn't have a voice. His bravery and determination is something that is rare in mankind. After watching ""Milk"" we could learn many things as to what makes people want to obtain that status that we all should have as God's people. The message in this film is clear- we homosexuals are no different than anyone, and when it comes to equal rights we will not stop fighting until those rights are obtained by us. Harvery Milk's work is still felt today, as we have come along way, but there is still work to be done, as homosexuals still cannot marry in America.Again, this movie wasn't made just for the gay audience- straights could learn a lot from watching this film. After viewing it people get a very good understanding of the hatred and bitterness felt towards gays from our heterosexual counterparts.The movie really works. The best part of the film is how we are actually put back to the late '70s, in which the producers use actual news footage from the American netwoks documenting the events of Harvey's plight as a poltician, and his work for gay rights. Anita Bryant, probably the biggest hater of gays, is seen in newsreels venting her anger and venom against people who are different.The picture also dramatizes Harvey's love life as well, as we see how he balances his work and personal life, sometimes often ending in tragic results.The cast is perfect, and Penn was made for this role. Josh Brolin is also impeccable as the man who untilmately destroys Harvery's life. The other roles too are performed by first-rate actors.""Milk"" would go on to receive 8 Academy Awards nominations, winning Best Actor for Sean Penn, and one for cutie Dustin Lance Black for Best Original screenplay. The picture is also a boxoffice hit and sold millions of DVDs in the first few weeks of release.The DVD comes with a lot of bonuses, including deleted scenes, and documentaries on ""Remembering Harvey Milk"", ""Hollywood Comes To San Francisco"", and ""Marching for Equality"".There is also an excellent documentary on Harvery Milk, that came out in 2004 called ""The Life of Harvey Milk"", that is available on DVD. I would suggest watching that DVD first before watching the film, as it gives an insight into what made this man who he was.Focus Features, who produced and marketed ""Brokeback Mountain"", also released ""Milk"", and they should be applauded for the work they have done in releasing not only a well-dramatized film, but a great educational tool.",5,"""Best Gay-Themed Movie Since ""Brokeback Mountain""!""",1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,3154,"['Probably', 'best', 'thing', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'ever', 'done', 'acting', 'career', 'Milk', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'not', 'just', 'gay', 'audience', 'watching', 'picture', 'ones', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'gay', 'people', 'went', 'back', '1970', 'as', 'far', 'recognition', 'respect', 'concerned', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'tough', 'now', 'world', 'was', 'more', 'difficult', '30', 'years', 'ago.Sean', 'Penn', 'Harvery', 'Milk', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'person', 'who', 'held', 'position', 'public', 'office', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'Board', 'Supervisors', 'San', 'Francisco', 'was', 'determined', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'would', 'obtain', 'same', 'rights', 'heterosexuals', 'Harvey', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'gay', 'hero', 'hero', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'voice', 'bravery', 'determination', 'something', 'rare', 'mankind', 'watching', 'Milk', 'could', 'learn', 'many', 'things', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'obtain', 'status', 'should', 'have', 'God', 'people', 'message', 'film', 'clear-', 'homosexuals', 'are', 'different', 'anyone', 'when', 'equal', 'rights', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'fighting', 'rights', 'are', 'obtained', 'Harvery', 'Milk', 'work', 'still', 'felt', 'today', 'have', 'come', 'way', 'still', 'work', 'be', 'done', 'homosexuals', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'marry', 'America.Again', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'just', 'gay', 'audience-', 'straights', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'watching', 'film', 'viewing', 'people', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'understanding', 'hatred', 'bitterness', 'felt', 'towards', 'gays', 'heterosexual', 'counterparts.The', 'movie', 'really', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'how', 'are', 'actually', 'put', 'back', 'late', ""'70s"", 'producers', 'use', 'actual', 'news', 'footage', 'American', 'netwoks', 'documenting', 'events', 'Harvey', 'plight', 'poltician', 'work', 'gay', 'rights', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'probably', 'biggest', 'hater', 'gays', 'seen', 'newsreels', 'venting', 'anger', 'venom', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different.The', 'picture', 'also', 'Harvey', 'love', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'how', 'work', 'personal', 'life', 'sometimes', 'often', 'ending', 'tragic', 'results.The', 'cast', 'perfect', 'Penn', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'also', 'impeccable', 'man', 'who', 'untilmately', 'Harvery', 'life', 'other', 'roles', 'too', 'are', 'performed', 'first-rate', 'actors', 'Milk', 'would', 'go', 'receive', '8', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'nominations', 'winning', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'one', 'cutie', 'Dustin', 'Lance', 'Black', 'Best', 'Original', 'screenplay', 'picture', 'also', 'boxoffice', 'hit', 'sold', 'millions', 'DVDs', 'first', 'few', 'weeks', 'release.The', 'DVD', 'lot', 'bonuses', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'documentaries', 'Remembering', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Hollywood', 'Comes', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Marching', 'Equality', 'also', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Harvery', 'Milk', 'came', 'out', '2004', 'called', 'Life', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'available', 'DVD', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', 'DVD', 'first', 'before', 'watching', 'film', 'insight', 'what', 'made', 'man', 'who', 'was.Focus', 'Features', 'who', 'produced', 'marketed', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'also', 'released', 'Milk', 'should', 'be', 'applauded', 'work', 'have', 'done', 'releasing', 'not', 'only', 'well-dramatized', 'film', 'great', 'educational', 'tool']",Milk

That said, I thought it was a very, very good film, especially the scenes leading up the protests and riots.  The director shows the turbulent times and emotions that threaten to destroy the city yet is able to show us Milk's tender side and how his ambitions overshadowed his loves.I may be in the minority when I say this but I don't think this film deserved a best pic nomination.  It was very interesting and well-made but I thought other films in 2008 deserved equal or more recognition.  I also strongly believe that while Penn did a great job, his win probably wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the proposition 8 fiasco months before.  Were people in Hollywood feeling guilty for the Brokeback disaster three years before or did they honestly think Penn did a better job than Rourke?  Who knows.

1190652,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001FB55KI,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 4]","Gus Van Sant's ""Milk"" is a commanding and persuasive biopic that is easily the best thing to come from the hit-or-miss director in a very long time. Beautifully edited and sublimely acted, the film's only real flaw is its attempt to focus equally on both Harvey's personal and political life. Though idle in a couple of spots, few biopics are as fulfilling, entertaining, and thought-provoking as this contemporary masterwork which is not only theatrically well-timed but exhibits hardships that have still not been overcome - 30 years after the characters and events took place. And of course praise goes to Sean Penn who has yet again delivered a tour de force performance that is not likely to be bested before the year is up.Milk begins in 1978 with the Supervisor recording a message to be played only upon his assassination.  From there the film travels back in time to chronicle the extraordinary life and career of Harvey Milk from his arrival in San Francisco in 1970 to his rise to office in 1977 and every major battle against prejudice along the way.In Harvey Milk's personal life, several characters and events aren't always depicted with enough attention, which hints at scenes being cut or a time limit on those elements. Supporting character Jack Lira (Diego Luna) feels more like an afterthought, even though his role in real life would have been more prominent to Milk's story. But aside from such trivial flaws, the star talent behind the film gives it its lasting power. Sean Penn nails the mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of Harvey Milk with uncanny precision, and Josh Brolin, James Franco and Emile Hirsch deliver stunning performances as supporters and dissenters.The recreation of the locations and the times are also masterfully attended to, giving us a flavorful sampling of an influential era and a more vivid illustration of a man that few are probably familiar with. In a multi-director, two-decade stretch of attempting to get a film on the Mayor of Castro Street's life made, Focus Features has won out, and will again be competing for honors for performances with a film that mirrors the successes and struggles of 2005's Brokeback Mountain, which ultimately lost to Crash for the Best Picture Academy Award.A testament to the powerful storytelling at work is the fact that Harvey Milk's assassination is revealed almost immediately in the film.  Yet knowing his tragic fate won't deter the audience from investing in his plight and continuing to root for the underdog's triumph in the end.

There he came out of the closet and opened a camera shop in the Castro District, an area experiencing a huge influx of gays and lesbians.  He ran for political office unsuccessfully several times on a platform that included workers' issues and education as well as the rights of gays and other minorities, and finally won an election for city supervisor.  He led several battles against anti-gay initiatives in California.Penn presents Milk primarily as outspoken activist, community organizer, and champion of civil rights for gay Americans.  Director Van Sant combines actual news and archival footage with footage of his actors to illustrate seamlessly the 1970's era that saw the birth of the gay rights movement in the United States.""Milk,"" however, is more than just the tale of a firebrand working up the populace into action.  It's a movie about one person spearheading a movement to give voice to a minority that had been forced into hiding.  By fighting for the right to live without persecution, the gay community became a visible, political force that voted its mind at the polls.  Milk worked to organize and inspire his constituency out of complacency and acceptance of intimidation to active protest and demands.  It started in California, but quickly spread across the country.Mr. Penn does some of his finest work in ""Milk."" From his slicked down hair to his softly Brooklyn-tinged voice to his self-assured swagger, Penn provides an amazing characterization of a man who, in his 40's, finally found a purpose and the wherewithal to achieve it.There is a self-deprecating facet to Penn's performance.  His Harvey can make jokes at his own expense while taking his cause seriously.  Mr. Penn captures the folk-hero quality of Milk while never losing sight of Harvey the man.  We see him as a flawed individual, not happy in his previous pursuits and as terrified of discovery as most gay people of the time, but ultimately inspired by injustice to be the voice of protest and change.The movie shows how that change comes in stages.  What starts as periodic clashes with the police leads to grass-roots organization for the purpose of declaring themselves to the larger society and persuade the world that they are entitled to the same rights as anybody else.  Milk recruits average folks -- mostly gay -- who can summon a crowd of 1,000 protesters on a moment's notice or get endorsements from local newspapers.Among these associates are Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill), and photographer Danny Nicoletta (Lucas Grabeel).  We're also introduced to two of Milk's boyfriends, Scott Smith (James Franco) and Jack Lira (Diego Luna).Scott seems to be the inspiration for Harvey to embark on a more meaningful course.  Franco is entirely believable in some intimate scenes with Penn.  It's in the early scenes, in his conversations with Scott, that we see Harvey's frustration at approaching his 40th birthday and not really having done anything significant.  He's ready for a change.  They leave New York together to resettle in San Francisco only to find a not-too-welcoming introduction to the Castro District's businessmen.Josh Brolin plays Dan White, a fellow city supervisor, who shares an unusual collegial relationship with Milk.  Staunchly in favor of preserving ""family values"" and blocking any pro-gay legislation, White is an enigma.  As portrayed in the movie, he doesn't have many friends, appears uncomfortable at the inroads the gay community is making in California, is dissatisfied with his job as city supervisor because of its low pay, and ultimately is jealous of the media attention Milk is getting while he remains anonymous.  Brolin continues to associate himself with top-quality motion pictures.  Excellent in ""No Country for Old Men,""  ""American Gangster,"" and ""W.,"" he continues his winning streak in ""Milk.""Rated R, ""Milk"" won the Best Actor Academy Award for Penn, and was nominated for Best Picture.  The script by Dustin Lance Black moves quickly and presents the events of Milk's life in dramatic, fascinating fashion.  The film is extremely timely in light of California's passage of Proposition 8, which bars same-sex marriages.  Though Harvey Milk fought vigorously thirty years ago for gays to receive the same rights as all other Americans, it seems the fight isn't over.",5,Sean Penn Tour-de-Force,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,4472,"['Milk', 'stars', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'title', 'role', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'closeted', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'San', 'Francisco', '1972', 'came', 'closet', 'opened', 'camera', 'shop', 'Castro', 'District', 'area', 'experiencing', 'huge', 'influx', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'ran', 'political', 'office', 'unsuccessfully', 'several', 'times', 'platform', 'included', 'workers', 'issues', 'education', 'as', 'well', 'rights', 'gays', 'other', 'minorities', 'finally', 'won', 'election', 'city', 'supervisor', 'led', 'several', 'battles', 'anti-gay', 'initiatives', 'California.Penn', 'presents', 'Milk', 'primarily', 'outspoken', 'activist', 'community', 'organizer', 'champion', 'civil', 'rights', 'gay', 'Americans', 'Director', 'Van', 'Sant', 'actual', 'news', 'archival', 'footage', 'footage', 'actors', 'illustrate', 'seamlessly', '1970', 'era', 'saw', 'birth', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'United', 'States', 'Milk', 'however', 'more', 'just', 'tale', 'firebrand', 'working', 'up', 'populace', 'action', 'movie', 'one', 'person', 'spearheading', 'movement', 'give', 'voice', 'minority', 'had', 'been', 'forced', 'hiding', 'fighting', 'right', 'live', 'persecution', 'gay', 'community', 'became', 'visible', 'political', 'force', 'voted', 'mind', 'polls', 'Milk', 'worked', 'organize', 'inspire', 'constituency', 'complacency', 'acceptance', 'intimidation', 'active', 'protest', 'demands', 'started', 'California', 'quickly', 'spread', 'country.Mr', 'Penn', 'finest', 'work', 'Milk', 'slicked', 'down', 'hair', 'softly', 'Brooklyn-tinged', 'voice', 'self-assured', 'swagger', 'Penn', 'amazing', 'characterization', 'man', 'who', '40', 'finally', 'found', 'purpose', 'wherewithal', 'achieve', 'self-deprecating', 'facet', 'Penn', 'performance', 'Harvey', 'can', 'make', 'jokes', 'own', 'expense', 'taking', 'cause', 'seriously', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'folk-hero', 'quality', 'Milk', 'never', 'losing', 'sight', 'Harvey', 'man', 'see', 'flawed', 'individual', 'not', 'happy', 'previous', 'pursuits', 'terrified', 'discovery', 'most', 'gay', 'people', 'time', 'ultimately', 'inspired', 'injustice', 'be', 'voice', 'protest', 'change.The', 'movie', 'how', 'change', 'stages', 'What', 'periodic', 'clashes', 'police', 'grass-roots', 'organization', 'purpose', 'declaring', 'larger', 'society', 'persuade', 'world', 'are', 'entitled', 'same', 'rights', 'anybody', 'else', 'Milk', 'average', 'folks', 'mostly', 'gay', 'who', 'can', 'summon', 'crowd', '1,000', 'protesters', 'moment', 'notice', 'get', 'endorsements', 'local', 'associates', 'are', 'Cleve', 'Jones', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Anne', 'Kronenberg', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'photographer', 'Danny', 'Nicoletta', 'Lucas', 'Grabeel', ""'re"", 'also', 'introduced', 'two', 'Milk', 'boyfriends', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'James', 'Franco', 'Jack', 'Lira', 'Diego', 'Luna', '.Scott', 'be', 'inspiration', 'Harvey', 'embark', 'more', 'meaningful', 'course', 'Franco', 'entirely', 'believable', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'Penn', 'early', 'scenes', 'conversations', 'Scott', 'see', 'Harvey', 'frustration', 'approaching', '40th', 'birthday', 'not', 'really', 'having', 'done', 'anything', 'significant', 'ready', 'change', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'together', 'resettle', 'San', 'Francisco', 'only', 'find', 'not-too-welcoming', 'introduction', 'Castro', 'District', 'businessmen.Josh', 'Brolin', 'Dan', 'White', 'fellow', 'city', 'supervisor', 'who', 'shares', 'unusual', 'collegial', 'relationship', 'Milk', 'Staunchly', 'favor', 'preserving', 'family', 'values', 'blocking', 'pro-gay', 'legislation', 'White', 'enigma', 'portrayed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'friends', 'uncomfortable', 'inroads', 'gay', 'community', 'making', 'California', 'dissatisfied', 'job', 'city', 'supervisor', 'low', 'pay', 'ultimately', 'jealous', 'media', 'attention', 'Milk', 'getting', 'anonymous', 'Brolin', 'associate', 'top-quality', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Excellent', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'American', 'Gangster', 'W.', 'winning', 'streak', 'Milk', 'Rated', 'R', 'Milk', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Penn', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'script', 'Dustin', 'Lance', 'Black', 'quickly', 'events', 'Milk', 'life', 'dramatic', 'fascinating', 'fashion', 'film', 'extremely', 'timely', 'light', 'California', 'passage', 'Proposition', '8', 'same-sex', 'marriages', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'fought', 'vigorously', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'gays', 'receive', 'same', 'rights', 'other', 'Americans', 'fight', ""n't""]",Milk
1190654,A1MJFZ975LIEHE,B001FB55KI,"THE REAL REVIEW ""Only 100% truthful Reviews""","[5, 7]","Finally broke down and watched this flick. Almost everybody I know said it was a great film. It obviously did well at the Oscars and with such a stellar cast, I added all of the above together and figured this was a cant miss movie.First let me say that I am male and I am straight. But I do believe in equal rights for all so my negative feelings about this movie are just that..feelings about this movie, not the movement for equal rights.The pro's of this movie were few imo. The acting was absolutely stellar. Sean Penn never ceases to amaze me. I can not say enough about how well Penn played the role of Milk. Franco was excellent as well and they did do a good job in the film of showing why their relationship deteriorated yet how and why they still stayed so 'close' after they 'split up'.I would love to say I thought Brolins acting was stellar as well but I cant and that is a major negative to this movie. I cant say Brolins acting was bad either...again, a major negative. The fact is, Brolin was a CRITICAL character in this movie obviously, as he is the one who killed the Mayor and Harvey, yet we barely even got to know his character. Very little screen time for him and again, such a critical character, yet they did not let us get to know this character very well or let his character 'develop properly' so viewers had a better idea of what was driving his character. Very disappointed that Brolin got such litle screen time and viewers really did not 'get to know the character, his ideas, views and etc'. In fact, I cant really think of any movie in which one of the most critical charcaters was left so 'undeveloped' in the script/movie.The other pro's were it was nice to see plenty of real life clips from the 70's and from the areas in the film...You almost felt like you were time warping back to Castro Street in the 70's......The cons. I can see why Penn may have been nominated for some awards as his acting was simply stellar, but why did this movie get so much acclaim? Yes, I know it is a true story, but they could have made this less 'boring' somehow. Run time is approx 2 hours. When I was about 30 - 45 minutes in, it felt more like 2 or 3 hours. After an hour I found myself questioning why everybody loved this film as every minute seemed like and hour. Boring is what it was, imo, but I do realize I am in the minority here as judged by the reviews, oscar nominations and etc....but yes, I found this to be very boring and wishing the end would hurry up and get here.Since it was true and since I personally never knew harvey milk, I must assume that Penn did a good job or portraying who he was in real life..how he acted and etc....With true stories you cant change the character in to something different, as it then becomes not true. But if that is really how harvey milk acted in his real life, I can only say he was a cooky nutcase and although it is awesome he was the first gay public officer voted in to office, the guy was a nut..a cooky guy..and if I had known him, I would not have voted for him..again, nothing about the equal rights thing..I just think we have some serious issues with who we vote in to public offices and milk was a bit nutty to garner my vote.Great acting...cool flashbacks to the 70's....but far too boring for me. Not a movie I would watch a 2nd time so no need to own it. Worth a watch, but borrow it or rent it before buying..if you loved it..then buy it...if you found it to be too boring and will never watch it again, why buy it unless you get it in the 'bargain bin' as I did for $2.",2,Not all that,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,3563,"['Finally', 'broke', 'down', 'watched', 'flick', 'Almost', 'everybody', 'know', 'said', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'obviously', 'did', 'well', 'Oscars', 'such', 'stellar', 'cast', 'added', 'above', 'together', 'figured', 'was', 'cant', 'miss', 'movie.First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'male', 'am', 'straight', 'do', 'believe', 'equal', 'rights', 'so', 'negative', 'feelings', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'that..feelings', 'movie', 'not', 'movement', 'equal', 'rights.The', 'pro', 'movie', 'were', 'few', 'imo', 'acting', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'never', 'amaze', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'well', 'Penn', 'played', 'role', 'Milk', 'Franco', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'showing', 'why', 'relationship', 'deteriorated', 'yet', 'how', 'why', 'still', 'stayed', 'so', ""'close"", ""'split"", ""up'.I"", 'would', 'love', 'say', 'thought', 'Brolins', 'acting', 'was', 'stellar', 'as', 'well', 'cant', 'major', 'negative', 'movie', 'cant', 'say', 'Brolins', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'either', 'again', 'major', 'negative', 'fact', 'Brolin', 'was', 'CRITICAL', 'character', 'movie', 'obviously', 'one', 'who', 'killed', 'Mayor', 'Harvey', 'yet', 'barely', 'even', 'got', 'know', 'character', 'Very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'again', 'critical', 'character', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'get', 'know', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'let', 'character', 'properly', 'so', 'viewers', 'had', 'better', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'driving', 'character', 'Very', 'disappointed', 'Brolin', 'got', 'such', 'litle', 'screen', 'time', 'viewers', 'really', 'did', 'not', ""'get"", 'know', 'character', 'ideas', 'views', 'etc', 'fact', 'cant', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'critical', 'charcaters', 'was', 'left', 'so', ""'undeveloped"", 'script/movie.The', 'other', 'pro', 'were', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'plenty', 'real', 'life', 'clips', '70', 'areas', 'film', 'almost', 'felt', 'were', 'time', 'warping', 'back', 'Castro', 'Street', '70', 'cons', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Penn', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'awards', 'acting', 'was', 'simply', 'stellar', 'why', 'did', 'movie', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'acclaim', 'Yes', 'know', 'true', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'less', ""'boring"", 'somehow', 'Run', 'time', 'approx', '2', 'hours', 'When', 'was', 'about', '30', '45', 'minutes', 'felt', 'more', '2', '3', 'hours', 'hour', 'found', 'questioning', 'why', 'everybody', 'loved', 'film', 'minute', 'seemed', 'hour', 'Boring', 'what', 'was', 'imo', 'do', 'realize', 'am', 'minority', 'here', 'judged', 'reviews', 'oscar', 'nominations', 'etc', '.but', 'yes', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'boring', 'wishing', 'end', 'would', 'hurry', 'up', 'get', 'here.Since', 'was', 'true', 'personally', 'never', 'knew', 'harvey', 'milk', 'must', 'assume', 'Penn', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'life..how', 'acted', 'etc', '.With', 'true', 'stories', 'cant', 'change', 'character', 'something', 'different', 'then', 'not', 'true', 'really', 'how', 'harvey', 'milk', 'acted', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'was', 'cooky', 'nutcase', 'awesome', 'was', 'first', 'gay', 'public', 'officer', 'voted', 'office', 'guy', 'was', 'nut..a', 'cooky', 'guy..and', 'had', 'known', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'voted', 'him..again', 'nothing', 'equal', 'rights', 'thing..I', 'just', 'think', 'have', 'serious', 'issues', 'who', 'vote', 'public', 'offices', 'milk', 'was', 'bit', 'nutty', 'garner', 'vote.Great', 'acting', 'cool', 'flashbacks', '70', '.but', 'far', 'too', 'boring', 'Not', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', '2nd', 'time', 'need', 'own', 'watch', 'borrow', 'rent', 'buying..if', 'loved', 'it..then', 'buy', 'found', 'be', 'too', 'boring', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'why', 'buy', 'get', ""'bargain"", 'bin', 'did', '2']",Milk
1190655,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001FB55KI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 5]","Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) is making a tape recording, leaving an audio history of his life, in the event his life should be taken. He sits in his dark kitchen and begins to recount the key moments in his life.Thus begins ""Milk"", the new film from director Gus Van Sant (""Good Will Hunting"", ""My Own Private Idaho"") and writer Dustin Lance Black. Van Sant has assembled a great cast who work together to bring us the life story of this ground breaking politician.And Sean Penn is nothing short of amazing in this role. He brings Milk alive and makes his relationship with his two boyfriends, Scott Smith (James Franco) and Jack Lira (Diego Luna) believable. The story opens with Milk spotting Scott Smith in the New York subway. Milk is clearly attracted to the young man sporting a wild bush of hair and asks him to help him celebrate his birthday with him. Smith recognizes a glimmer of something special in the older man and agrees; Milk should not have to celebrate his birthday alone. Later, in bed, Milk mentions that he is upset he hasn't accomplished anything great in his life. He also mentions that he probably won't live to see 50. They move to San Francisco and end up in the Castro. During this time, gay men are regularly rounded up by the police, beaten and jailed, so Milk decides to do something about it. He uses his small camera shop as a campaign headquarters are recruits a group of gay male activists to aid him in his quest to make change. Scott is initially very helpful in the fight, but as Milk loses one election after another, he begins to feel neglected. Eventually, they break up and Milk finds himself attached to Jack Lira (Diego Luna), an emotionally unstable young man who would prefer to be attached at the hip to his new lover. And it seems to excite Jack that Harvey is in the public's eye, garnering attention. Eventually, Milk is elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and Dan White (Josh Brolin) joins him in the same capacity, looking out for his very different constituents. Anita Bryant is leading a successful campaign against homosexual rights in Florida. When the voters pass the bill, she moves on to other states. Harvey decides he wants to bring Anita to California, and fight her on his home turf. While all of this is going on, White feels powerless and ineffectual and tries to get Harvey to help him pass some bills important to his constituents. Milk wants Dan's support, so he says yes...At one point, it seems like everyone in Hollywood was attached to the biopic of Harvey Milk. It is an attractive project, providing the right actor with the role of a lifetime; a naturally charismatic leader who wages a fight against people who would rather not extend rights to a large and growing segment of the community, Milk was assassinated just as his political career was starting, essentially martyring him to a large group of people. It is a role that could provide an actor with many dramatic moments, and if portrayed correctly, many funny and romantic moments as well. The biopic has bounced around from one director to the next, one actor to the next. Finally, it landed in the hands of Gus Van Sant and Sean Penn. And it is a match that works. The two men have the right sensibilities, right talents and right maturity to make this film and it shows in every frame. ""Milk"" is a powerful, moving, emotional, well-made biopic about this famous politician the first openly gay politician whose life was cut too short.Using a screenplay by Dustin Lance Black, a writer and producer on HBO's ""Big Love"", Van Sant presents a fairly straightforward telling of Milk's life. Despite brief moments of Milk sitting in his kitchen in San Francisco, late at night, recounting the story of his life, the film uses this framing device to go from Point A, when Milk and Smith meet in San Francisco, to Point B, when Dan White, well, you know. In a way, I think this method of presenting Milk's life is particularly appropriate and a good choice. Too often, biopics can be overly romanticized and saccharin and this is a clich&eacute; that was rightly avoided in telling the story of the politician's life. Really, it would have been so easy to make him appear a saint and make him appear to be the first Gay martyr. Because the film stays away from this, to a certain degree, it seems more real and life like, more interesting and more capable of remaining in our memories for a long time. I've seen many biopics in my life and it is amazing how many of them are quickly forgotten for these same reasons.Van Sant is a very good director who seems to have learned from his previous mistakes and gained the maturity necessary to make this film. Again, it is told in a fairly straightforward way and he seems to concentrate on the performances from the actors, helping to coax the best work from them. He has given up on shot-by-shot remakes (""Psycho"") and existential landscapes (""Gerry"") and returned to the type of film that made him famous in the first place. It was the performances and the screenplay in ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""Good Will Hunting"" that made the public stand up and take notice.Sean Penn doesn't really look a lot like Harvey Milk (there is a photo of the real Milk at the very end of the film) and this is a good thing. A number of actors who have recently portrayed famous people seem to be going for more of an interpretation of the person they are depicting, rather than a full blown impersonation. Frank Langella's portrayal of Nixon in ""Frost/ Nixon"" is another recent example. Penn tries to evoke the former politician's life through some mannerisms, some of the politician's catch phrases, he may have even listened to some tapes of the politician to get his accent and vocalizations right. But he eschews a heavy make-up job in favor of a hair style that resembles Milk's, allowing the rest of the performance to come from within. This makes the performance seem all the more natural and real. We aren't watching Penn impersonate Milk; we are watching him re-create Milk. Langella did pretty much the same thing in his portrayal of Nixon. Both performances are extremely memorable.But Penn is an actor who tries to give everything he has to a role, becoming consumed in the character, doing everything he can to make the person he is playing jump off the screen. When it works, Penn is unforgettable. In ""Milk, it works and Penn seems to become the late politician. From the first moments when he is flirting with Smith, to the later moments when we see how much in love they are, to the moments before their relationship breaks up, we always get a sense that Milk will always care for and love Scott, even if their lives about to move in different directions. As Milk becomes more embroiled in politics, Penn portrays his growing desperation to try to make something happen, because he wants to help people. And when he is finally elected to the Board of Supervisors, after many failed elections, we see Milk's look of calm. Now he can make some changes. He can fight Anita Bryant, he can fight homophobia, he can change the way homosexuals live in San Francisco, California, the United States. But he has to take one step at a time.Milk is portrayed as a politician; Penn and Van Sant show him as a man intent on making change, but when he is elected to his position, he also recognizes he has to make some concessions, negotiate with others, he has to manipulate other politicians to help get some of the laws he wants passed. One of the people he tries to manipulate is another young politician on the Board of Supervisors, Dan White (Brolin). Showing this aspect of Milk makes him seem more believable because we recognize that most politicians probably face these same types of situations in their careers. It makes Milk seem real and prevents him from becoming a saint.As Milk is a gay man, his relationships with friends and lovers are depicted. Penn seems to realize that he has to portray this part of the aspect for all of it's worth as well; he can't shy away from making it seem real. If he did, the performance would fall flat and seem phony. So, Penn makes us believe that his Milk is really in love with James Franco's Scott Smith. And later, that he is in a relationship with the emotionally unstable Jack Lira (Diego Luna). There are many men who gravitate towards him and become integral parts of his many campaigns, but perhaps the most interesting is Milk's relationship with Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch). The politician passes Jones' on the sidewalk walking with a group of friends, ready to find the next party, and stops him. Initially, Jones thinks Milk is simply hitting on him, but Milk gets to the point. Your life can be so much more than this. Later, Jones returns to San Francisco and becomes a long-time member of the Milk campaign.James Franco deserves a lot of credit for diving head first into his portrayal of Scott Smith. We get a real sense of what brings these two men together, what causes them to remain partners for so long. Initially, he is very supportive of Milk's attempts to change society, to win an election, to become something. In fact, he is amazingly supportive and is always there for his partner, providing support, comfort and more when he needs it. But there comes a point when Scott starts to feel neglected and wants some of this attention returned to him. And Milk isn't able to do it because he is too busy fighting for gay rights, fighting Anita Bryant, trying to change things. When Smith realizes Milk will always put the priority on the cause, Franco plumbs the character and shows his inner sadness. He realizes they may be the love of each other's life, but Smith will have to share Milk's love with the causes his partner is so passionate about.Emile Hirsch is also good as Cleve Jones, a party boy who realizes and recognizes he needs to do something different with his life. In a way, he almost becomes Milk's enforcer, leading the more radical protests, the more outspoken protests, to protect Milk from the recriminations. And their relationship is portrayed well. It is clear that Milk sees Jones as a younger brother and tries to provide him with advice and balance along the way.Diego Luna's portrayal of Jack Lira seems the most showy and is the most unbelievable because of it. Maybe Lira actually was emotionally unstable and very clingy, but it seems fake and detracts from the film slightly. I have never been in a relationship like this (lucky me) so it is difficult for me to watch such an over the top performance and not find fault in it. I know people do get this crazy when they are in love, but because I have never experienced it, it simply seems over the top. And why does Milk stick around with the guy? It just doesn't work.Josh Brolin turns in another surprisingly good performance as Dan White, one of Milk's fellow supervisors. When the two characters first appear on screen, an ominous dread permeates. We know what is going to happen, but it is a testament to the actors' skill that we begin to feel these emotions the first time they meet. Brolin simmers quietly throughout, his anger rising minutely, sometimes almost imperceptibly with every slight. White wins the election and then tries to fight for his people, but he can't seem to get anything passed, any laws that might help the people who voted for him. He seeks some help from Milk who wants his support in exchange. White's proposed laws would only help a small portion of the public, so his fellow Supervisors shun him. White invites other members of the Board of Supervisors to his son's baptism, only Milk shows up. And Dan, a fine Irish- Catholic boy with a young wife and a new baby, has a lot of trouble reconciling that Milk is gay and so in your face about it. These problems, and many more, continue to eat away at White throughout the course of the film. Brolin maintains a quiet intensity, showing White's slow realization that he must do something, anything to keep from becoming the most ineffectual public leader in San Francisco. Brolin glowers and gets frustrated, but he doesn't shout or laugh maniacally, keeping the performance low key, interesting and the right match to Penn's happy, involving portrayal of Milk.Van Sant uses a little archival footage, but it blends seamlessly with the rest and gives us a real portrait of this period in the history of the Gay Rights movement. He also manages to help us understand what Milk was trying to do and provides us with a well-balanced portrait of this iconic leader.If Sean Penn isn't nominated for an Oscar, something is very, very

1190656,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B001FB55KI,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[2, 4]","When Dan White fired his gun at City Supervisor Harvey Milk, it was more than just a murder. It was the close of a chapter. It was the start of a revolution. It forever shifted the paradigm of Gay Politics. It gave the world the phrase ""twinkie defense."" And it made Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to a Public Office government position in the USA, a martyr.In this reverent biopic of Milk, there are a trio of personal bests that benefit the material involved. First and foremost, this is Gus Van Zandt's directorial triumph. For the first time since his Oscar winnerGood Will Hunting,, he's made a populist movie that doesn't betray his artistic capabilities. James Franco finally gets a role (as Milk's lover than friend Scott Smith) that lets him act instead of preen. Then finally, there is Sean Penn, in his best role sinceDead Man Walking. He doesn't just play the role of Harvey Milk, he becomes him, to the point that the resemblance is uncanny. His presence alone raises the quality of the movie a full star, most notably in that Penn is not playing a role normally associated with his body of work.While ""Milk"" tracks a history to an inevitable end, you'll still find yourself rooting for Harvey as he turns back the tides of discrimination. Seamless use of documentary footage, including that of Jimmy Carter and the shameful Anita Bryant (it should be noted that her career nosedived after her bigotry became her calling card) to great effect. The recreation of the 70's Castro district is lovingly accomplished, and there's a movie banner advertisingThe Poseidon Adventureat one point. While the movie never falls completely into nostalgia, it does allow for the romantic feel of adventure that brought so many to San Francisco. Harvey became a symbol of that, which is evidenced in the scenes were Harvey speaks to a disabled young man in the Midwest over the phone, who calls when he needs to feel the hope that Harvey and California offers.The trouble with paradise is there's always a demon lurking around. In this case, it is Dan White, (Josh Brolin, having a smashing year between this movie andW), the hyper-competitive and potential closet case who is attracted/repulsed by Harvey and his achievements. When he resigns and then realizes he can't take his job back, the dominoes are set to fall. (Historical note, Dan White was upset that the Jonestown Massacre took place within days after he tendered his resignation, complaining that he couldn't get newspaper coverage like Harvey's no matter what he did.) Brolin gets the conflicted personality perfect, slowly disintegrating as the film rolls out.Along with the main players, there's a host of others doing great work. Emille Hirsch (whom Penn directed inInto the Wild) is spunk and snark as activist Cleve Jones. Producer Howard Rosenman has a solid turn as Advocate Publisher David Goodstein, who didn't initially back Harvey's political campaigns but endorsed ""gay friendly"" straight candidates instead. There is so much to watch for in ""Milk,"" but the main thing to absorb is the story of the man. Harvey Milk was the first out gay person many people in the US ever saw, and he made many realize that homosexuals could be the average man in the street, with the capability to the work that didn't fit the stereotypes.For more on the Golden Decade of San Francisco, readThe Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk,Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer Vol. 1andSome Dance To Remember: A Memoir-novel Of San Francisco, 1970-1982.",5,The day the seventies ended.,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,3546,"['When', 'Dan', 'White', 'fired', 'gun', 'City', 'Supervisor', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'murder', 'was', 'close', 'chapter', 'was', 'start', 'revolution', 'forever', 'shifted', 'paradigm', 'Gay', 'Politics', 'gave', 'world', 'phrase', 'twinkie', 'defense', 'made', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'be', 'elected', 'Public', 'Office', 'government', 'position', 'USA', 'martyr.In', 'reverent', 'biopic', 'Milk', 'are', 'trio', 'personal', 'bests', 'benefit', 'material', 'involved', 'First', 'foremost', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'directorial', 'triumph', 'first', 'time', 'Oscar', 'winnerGood', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'made', 'populist', 'movie', ""n't"", 'betray', 'artistic', 'capabilities', 'James', 'Franco', 'finally', 'role', 'Milk', 'lover', 'friend', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'act', 'instead', 'preen', 'Then', 'finally', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'best', 'role', 'sinceDead', 'Man', 'Walking', ""n't"", 'just', 'play', 'role', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'point', 'resemblance', 'uncanny', 'presence', 'alone', 'quality', 'movie', 'full', 'star', 'most', 'notably', 'Penn', 'not', 'playing', 'role', 'normally', 'associated', 'body', 'work.While', 'Milk', 'history', 'inevitable', 'end', ""'ll"", 'still', 'find', 'rooting', 'Harvey', 'back', 'tides', 'discrimination', 'Seamless', 'use', 'documentary', 'footage', 'including', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'shameful', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'career', 'nosedived', 'bigotry', 'became', 'calling', 'card', 'great', 'effect', 'recreation', '70', 'Castro', 'district', 'lovingly', 'accomplished', 'movie', 'banner', 'Poseidon', 'Adventureat', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'never', 'completely', 'nostalgia', 'allow', 'romantic', 'feel', 'adventure', 'brought', 'so', 'many', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Harvey', 'became', 'symbol', 'evidenced', 'scenes', 'were', 'Harvey', 'speaks', 'disabled', 'young', 'man', 'Midwest', 'phone', 'who', 'when', 'feel', 'hope', 'Harvey', 'California', 'offers.The', 'trouble', 'paradise', 'always', 'demon', 'lurking', 'around', 'case', 'Dan', 'White', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'having', 'smashing', 'year', 'movie', 'andW', 'hyper-competitive', 'potential', 'closet', 'case', 'who', 'attracted/repulsed', 'Harvey', 'achievements', 'When', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'job', 'back', 'dominoes', 'are', 'set', 'fall', 'Historical', 'note', 'Dan', 'White', 'was', 'upset', 'Jonestown', 'Massacre', 'took', 'place', 'days', 'tendered', 'resignation', 'complaining', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'newspaper', 'coverage', 'Harvey', 'matter', 'what', 'did', 'Brolin', 'conflicted', 'personality', 'perfect', 'slowly', 'disintegrating', 'film', 'rolls', 'main', 'players', 'host', 'others', 'doing', 'great', 'work', 'Emille', 'Hirsch', 'whom', 'Penn', 'directed', 'Wild', 'spunk', 'snark', 'activist', 'Cleve', 'Jones', 'Producer', 'Howard', 'Rosenman', 'solid', 'turn', 'Advocate', 'Publisher', 'David', 'Goodstein', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'initially', 'back', 'Harvey', 'political', 'campaigns', 'endorsed', 'gay', 'friendly', 'straight', 'candidates', 'instead', 'so', 'much', 'watch', 'Milk', 'main', 'thing', 'absorb', 'story', 'man', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'was', 'first', 'out', 'gay', 'person', 'many', 'people', 'US', 'ever', 'saw', 'made', 'many', 'realize', 'homosexuals', 'could', 'be', 'average', 'man', 'street', 'capability', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'stereotypes.For', 'more', 'Golden', 'Decade', 'San', 'Francisco', 'readThe', 'Mayor', 'Castro', 'Street', 'Life', 'Times', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Gay', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Eyewitness', 'Drummer', 'Vol', '1andSome', 'Dance', 'Remember', 'Memoir-novel', 'San', 'Francisco', '1970-1982']",Milk
1190657,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B001FB55KI,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[84, 109]","Allow me to agree with at least one other reviewer that everyone should see this, especially those who think being gay is so far out of the mainstream that, as my father in law once said, ""The Lord allowed AIDS to happen.""Harvey Milk. A man of whom I know little. I lived on the other side of the world when he died, in a city in which it was not unusual to run into eunuchs. I'd heard of him since, in reference to gayness, but never associated any importance to him. Then I saw that Sean Penn was playing Milk, so I told my spouse that we need to see it.Milk, it seemed, lived a pretty conventional lifestyle, working for an insurance company in New York. According to the script, anyway, in 1970 he met a flame and they headed to the west coast. Despite local resistance, they set up shop in the Castro district of San Francisco (after ""The Haight"" had become riddled with crime, homelessness and the like). Milk then decided it was time to get politically active.In this portion of the film, I thought for a while that I was going to suffer from motion sickness. The camera seemed to move quite rapidly, and cut from the scene they were shooting to a historical scene, and back. But I adjusted. And Milk lost the first election, then the second, then the third. That, believe it or not, didn't take too much time for the film to get across, except that Milk's lover, Scott (played by James Franco) left after he said he couldn't take another one. That's when the action started (!)I'm not gay, and have never been terribly sympathetic to many of the gay causes. At least I never payed much attention to 'em. Yeah, I heard outrageous statements like I quoted above, but I just disregarded them. After this film, my spouse felt guilty that she didn't know much about the Milk case. I pointed out that she wasn't exposed to it much. Even to this day many of the gay ""causes"" aren't seen as so mainstream. They're seen as somewhat fringe. Some alleged ""gay eccentricities"" may have added to that exclusion, and I believe the film included that element. Indeed, that's why Harvey Milk decided to go to Orange County, CA, without his gay supporters, and debate State Senator Briggs, played by Dennis O'Hare, the proponent of Proposition 6, a gay rights provision to which gays were opposed, on his own terms. And it paid off! The proposition was defeated!Throughout the film, Milk was reciting a testament into his tape recorder, to be played only if he were assasinated. I wish I knew whether Milk really did that or whether it was added to the film for ""effect."" Either way, it was the adhesive that kept the film together.The historical clips also added to the film's credibility, especially those of Anita Bryant. After Bryant's success in some anti-gay initiatives around the country, Milk decided to bring her causes to the attention of the people of California, and that's where the Proposition 6 movement began.There's so much I could say about the film. I don't want to cover anything of the murder case, as I'll give too much away. The acting was definitely Oscar material, especially for Sean Penn. The script and music were award-winning. But the reason I endorse it--especially for those most opposed to gay rights--is that it shows that those rights are no less constitutional or mainstream than the rights of blacks, women, or any other groups which have had to labor hard for the last 230 years!Whether the film was timed to come out--no pun intended--after California's Proposition 8, I don't know. But it's well timed in terms of trying to educate people as to why those right should be guaranteed.Today we have people like Keith Olbermann to editorialize on those who opposed Proposition 8. We can thank God for Harvey Milk, the ""first openly gay"" person in politics in the US, for having opened to doors for those contemporay editorials.It's also, by the way, a testament to the cause of political activism in general; most activists find themselves in a rut deeper than that of Milk and his associates. This film may remind them to persist!See this gem, and make sure those challenged by gay rights see it. Discuss it with them.

1190661,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001FB55KI,Turfseer,"[3, 6]","Many people thought that Brokeback Mountain would be the first gay-themed film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Alas, it was not meant to be. Now Milk has taken its shot but despite it earnestness, it too has fallen short.Milk had a bit more going for it than Brokeback in terms of public acceptance. Its principal advantage was that Harvey Milk (very well-played by Sean Penn) is an extremely likable character who championed a cause that most Americans were in favor of (we find out in ""Milk"" that even Ronald Reagan was opposed to the bigoted Proposition 6). Brokeback, on the other hand focused on two closeted gay characters, one who ends up consorting with male prostitutes. Despite the tragic murder of Harvey Milk, the film's theme is a positive and uplifting one; Brokeback on the other hand was more tragic and downbeat.The film's screenplay relies on actual tape recordings recorded shortly before Milk's death. Much of the story is held together by Milk's posthumous narration. Some critics objected to the use of this device but I thought it worked well along with director Van Slant's creative use of old documentary footage from that era.The film begins with Milk at age 40, just as he is about to leave for San Francisco. (Check out Wikipedia for his earlier biography--believe it or not, he supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 elections!). While Milk's private life is examined in some detail, most of the film focuses on his political activism.Milk is most successful when it avoids (as one critic puts it) ""agenda-driven agitprop"". The best scenes are the most historical and revelatory: Milk's rejection of established gay leaders (the leading gay newspaper, The Advocate initially supports straight candidates when Milk starts running for office), the initiation of a blacklist of businesses that are hostile to gays and his ability to control angry crowds of gays during emotionally charged street demonstrations.The strongest part of the film involves Milk challenging the proponents of Proposition 6 and successfully defeating a bill that had the potential to erode constitutional freedoms (Milk has the courage to go face to face in hostile venues with John Briggs, the California State Senator, primarily responsible for championing Proposition 6).The film is less successful in the depiction of Milk's failed campaigns for political office (basically due to the lack of a primary antagonist such as an Anita Bryant/John Briggs character introduced in the film's second half).Milk's personal life revolved around three main characters: his first lover Scott Smith (a character I remember little about); Cleve Jones (a flamboyant street activist who helps Milk on his campaign and who's a prominent presence throughout the story) and Jack Lira (Milk's second lover, emotionally insecure, who commits suicide after feeling that Milk is neglecting him). Some critics questioned why Milk stuck with Lira for so long. It's explained simply during the film: Milk needed someone who wasn't involved in politics who he could relax with after a grinding day at the office.Milk is bolstered tremendously by an extremely strong performance by Josh Brolin as Dan White, Harvey Milk's assassin. Brolin looks like White and conveys the deep contempt and menace under the surface. Ironically, Milk predicts his assassination by anti-gay fanatics. But White's anger toward Milk is much more personal: he's a disgruntled, jealous colleague who not only murders Milk but shoots the straight mayor as well!Milk has a great look to it. It has a simplistic but strong message: intolerance is unacceptable. While most of the characters that revolve around Milk are not depicted as saints, they basically all have hearts of gold (that's perhaps Milk's principal weakness). Furthermore, the activists weren't as well-behaved in real-life as the film suggests (anti-Proposition 6 proponents sometimes reacted violently during street demonstrations).Now that the The Academy Awards are in, I must confess that I believed 'Milk' had a chance for best picture. But looking back, it's obvious that it's a picture that wasn't big enough in scope to take the top award. Nonetheless, Director Gus Van Sant managed to avoid turning 'Milk' into a hagiography and admirably eschewed the kind of sentimental plotting that has sunk other biopics in the past.",3,Van Sant's realistic approach eschews most biopic clich&eacute;s,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,4351,"['Many', 'people', 'thought', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'gay-themed', 'film', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Alas', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'Now', 'Milk', 'taken', 'shot', 'earnestness', 'too', 'fallen', 'short.Milk', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'going', 'Brokeback', 'terms', 'public', 'acceptance', 'principal', 'advantage', 'was', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'very', 'well-played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'extremely', 'likable', 'character', 'who', 'championed', 'cause', 'most', 'Americans', 'were', 'favor', 'find', 'out', 'Milk', 'even', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'opposed', 'bigoted', 'Proposition', '6', 'Brokeback', 'other', 'hand', 'focused', 'two', 'closeted', 'gay', 'characters', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'consorting', 'male', 'prostitutes', 'tragic', 'murder', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'film', 'theme', 'positive', 'uplifting', 'one', 'Brokeback', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'more', 'tragic', 'downbeat.The', 'film', 'screenplay', 'actual', 'tape', 'recordings', 'recorded', 'shortly', 'Milk', 'death', 'Much', 'story', 'held', 'together', 'Milk', 'posthumous', 'narration', 'critics', 'objected', 'use', 'device', 'thought', 'worked', 'well', 'director', 'Van', 'Slant', 'creative', 'use', 'old', 'documentary', 'footage', 'era.The', 'film', 'Milk', 'age', '40', 'just', 'leave', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Check', 'out', 'Wikipedia', 'earlier', 'biography', 'believe', 'not', 'supported', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', '1964', 'elections', 'Milk', 'private', 'life', 'examined', 'detail', 'most', 'film', 'political', 'activism.Milk', 'most', 'successful', 'when', 'avoids', 'one', 'critic', 'agenda-driven', 'agitprop', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'historical', 'revelatory', 'Milk', 'rejection', 'established', 'gay', 'leaders', 'leading', 'gay', 'newspaper', 'Advocate', 'initially', 'straight', 'candidates', 'when', 'Milk', 'running', 'office', 'initiation', 'blacklist', 'businesses', 'are', 'hostile', 'gays', 'ability', 'control', 'angry', 'crowds', 'gays', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'street', 'demonstrations.The', 'strongest', 'part', 'film', 'Milk', 'challenging', 'proponents', 'Proposition', '6', 'successfully', 'defeating', 'bill', 'had', 'potential', 'erode', 'constitutional', 'freedoms', 'Milk', 'courage', 'go', 'face', 'face', 'hostile', 'venues', 'John', 'Briggs', 'California', 'State', 'Senator', 'primarily', 'responsible', 'championing', 'Proposition', '6', '.The', 'film', 'less', 'successful', 'depiction', 'Milk', 'failed', 'campaigns', 'political', 'office', 'basically', 'due', 'lack', 'primary', 'antagonist', 'such', 'Anita', 'Bryant/John', 'Briggs', 'character', 'introduced', 'film', 'second', 'half', '.Milk', 'personal', 'life', 'revolved', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'lover', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'character', 'remember', 'little', 'Cleve', 'Jones', 'flamboyant', 'street', 'activist', 'who', 'Milk', 'campaign', 'who', 'prominent', 'presence', 'story', 'Jack', 'Lira', 'Milk', 'second', 'lover', 'emotionally', 'insecure', 'who', 'suicide', 'feeling', 'Milk', 'neglecting', 'critics', 'questioned', 'why', 'Milk', 'stuck', 'Lira', 'so', 'long', 'explained', 'simply', 'film', 'Milk', 'needed', 'someone', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'politics', 'who', 'could', 'relax', 'grinding', 'day', 'office.Milk', 'bolstered', 'tremendously', 'extremely', 'strong', 'performance', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Dan', 'White', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'assassin', 'Brolin', 'White', 'conveys', 'deep', 'contempt', 'menace', 'surface', 'Ironically', 'Milk', 'assassination', 'anti-gay', 'fanatics', 'White', 'anger', 'Milk', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'disgruntled', 'jealous', 'colleague', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'murders', 'Milk', 'shoots', 'straight', 'mayor', 'as', 'well', 'Milk', 'great', 'look', 'simplistic', 'strong', 'message', 'intolerance', 'unacceptable', 'most', 'characters', 'revolve', 'Milk', 'are', 'not', 'depicted', 'saints', 'basically', 'have', 'hearts', 'gold', 'perhaps', 'Milk', 'principal', 'weakness', 'Furthermore', 'activists', 'were', ""n't"", 'well-behaved', 'real-life', 'film', 'anti-Proposition', '6', 'proponents', 'sometimes', 'reacted', 'violently', 'street', 'demonstrations', '.Now', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'are', 'must', 'confess', 'believed', 'had', 'chance', 'best', 'picture', 'looking', 'back', 'obvious', 'picture', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough', 'scope', 'take', 'top', 'award', 'Nonetheless', 'Director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'managed', 'avoid', 'turning', 'hagiography', 'admirably', 'eschewed', 'kind', 'sentimental', 'plotting', 'sunk', 'other', 'biopics', 'past']",Milk
1190662,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001FB55KI,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","MILK is a biopic about Harvey Milk, a homosexual political activist who moved back to San Francisco in 1972 and after several losing campaigns was eventually elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California. The film is a pasteurized biopic that begins on Harvey Milk's (Sean Penn's) birthday and his move to San Francisco with his then lover, Scott Smith (James Franco). Upon arriving in the city, the couple opens a camera shop on Castro Street., which eventually becomes the headquarters for the local gay community as well as Milk's campaign headquarters for the various political offices he would run for. MILK loosely follows Harvey's life through his political campaigns until after several failed attempts at other offices, he is eventually elected as one of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors. In the movie, upon being elected Milk forms an alliance with fellow Supervisor Dan White (Josh Brolin). White agrees to support Milk's city-wide gay rights ordinance if Milk will support his attempt to keep a psychiatric hospital from opening in the neighborhood he represents. White is true to his word and is initially supportive of Milk's initiatives, but then Milk betrays White by not supporting him and voting for the establishment of the psychiatric hospital in White's district. White is dismayed and becomes Milk's adversary and nemesis, voting against everything he supports and voting for everything that he is against. Milk doesn't seem shocked at all by White's behavior and seems to take a sadistic joy in tormenting him. It is White who ultimately kills both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Mascone (Victor Garber). The movie basically ends showing the streets filled with people in a candle-lit march in honor of Milk and Mascone.The best thing about MILK is the acting, particularly the supporting cast. James Franco does an excellent job portraying Scott Smith, the man who came back to San Francisco with Harvey Milk and was later abandoned by him. Josh Brolin, portraying Dan White, continues to amaze with his chameleon-like abilities to almost become the characters he portrays. Also notable is Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, a follower of Milk's who becomes a gay activist leader himself. There's been a huge hoopla about Sean Penn and his portrayal of Harvey Milk, cumulating in his win for Best Actor at the Oscars. I don't know what the hoopla is all about. Penn's performance is passable, but in all honesty it's not great. In fact, the whole time I was watching MILK in my mind I kept thinking all he was doing was a variation of Sam Dawson from I AM SAM; a performance Penn almost lost his career over.The uberexuberance over Penn's performance also seems to carry over to the movie as a whole because even though MILK is a decent movie, it's not a great movie. Don't get me wrong. I didn't hate the movie, but I just don't think it's as good as it is being marketed. MILK follows the same clich&eacute;-ridden pattern that countless other biopics before it set forth. Everything from the movie's score, to the arc of the story structure, to the overextended final images Milk sees at his death, to the triumphant candle-lit march at the end of the movie are ripped from the playbook of the biopic. The film displays very little originality and offers nothing new to the medium. Not only that but it glosses over or ignores the more interesting parts of Milk's character and portrays him in a far more positive light than he really was. Towards the end of the movie, Harvey Milk is talking to Mayor Mascone and the Mayor says, ""You know who you sounded like just then? Boss Tweed."" The statement is meant as a compliment but shouldn't be. Boss Tweed was an evil and ruthless man and is someone we should be trying to avoid being like and not emulate.

Penn, Hirsch, Pill, and Brolin were all well chosen for their parts, and they even physically resemble the people they portray.  It's also a look back at the turbulence and fashion of the 1970s, with disco, wide ties, funny hairstyles, and big cars.There are some loose ends that left me wanting a bit more.  Who was the young fellow in the wheelchair that we only saw a couple of times?  Was he a real person or some kind of symbol?  Why didn't the James Franco character stay with Milk?  Why did Jack choose to exit in a very dramatic and upsetting way?  Since the Twinkie defense makes no sense as a motive for killing someone, what was Dan White's beef with Milk other than his political rivalry and losses?

1190670,A5A2QE6NECFR5,B001FB55KI,William E. Adams,"[1, 3]","Sean Penn does a fine job impersonating the assassinated San Francisco politician Harvey Milk here, but the film itself is less than perfect. I needed a bit less of the gay personal relations drama, and a bit more about Mayor George Moscone, who was also killed, and Dan White, the emotionally disturbed fellow city supervisor who shot both men. Moscone is almost totally absent from the movie, but in my recollection of the events, he was as  important an irritant in Dan White's mental crisis as Milk. And White's decision to go to City Hall with a pistol that day is not presented coherently here. I don't care much for Penn's radical politics or apparently real-life personality, but it is hard to deny his talents. And Mr. Milk, by most accounts, had courage and political integrity, and did not deserve his fate any more than Moscone did. In this version of the events, Milk's political rise is much more interesting than his personal life. A question that has not been answered fully is which part of Milk's life was, to Dan White, a more compelling reason to shoot him too?",3,The movie needed more about the killer and the other victim...,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,1081,"['Sean', 'Penn', 'fine', 'job', 'impersonating', 'assassinated', 'San', 'Francisco', 'politician', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'here', 'film', 'less', 'perfect', 'needed', 'bit', 'less', 'gay', 'personal', 'relations', 'drama', 'bit', 'more', 'Mayor', 'George', 'Moscone', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'killed', 'Dan', 'White', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'fellow', 'city', 'supervisor', 'who', 'shot', 'men', 'Moscone', 'almost', 'totally', 'absent', 'movie', 'recollection', 'events', 'was', 'important', 'irritant', 'Dan', 'White', 'mental', 'crisis', 'Milk', 'White', 'decision', 'go', 'City', 'Hall', 'pistol', 'day', 'not', 'presented', 'coherently', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Penn', 'radical', 'politics', 'apparently', 'real-life', 'personality', 'hard', 'deny', 'talents', 'Mr', 'Milk', 'most', 'accounts', 'had', 'courage', 'political', 'integrity', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'fate', 'more', 'Moscone', 'did', 'version', 'events', 'Milk', 'political', 'rise', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'personal', 'life', 'question', 'not', 'been', 'answered', 'fully', 'part', 'Milk', 'life', 'was', 'Dan', 'White', 'more', 'compelling', 'reason', 'shoot', 'too']",Milk

""Milk"" is better than most, but it still has its share.One of the script's good points is its refusal to demonize Dan White, who's portrayed as a thoroughly confused and unbalanced human being. (It's not surprising he eventually committed suicide.) Though obviously a queer-hater, one gets the feeling that White's murder of Milk and Moscone was primarily more to his being politically thwarted and ""humiliated"". Even had the conflict not been over gay rights, he probably would killed whomever he thought had harmed him. (Moscone wasn't gay.) He did not understand the nature of politics.Harvey Milk seems to have understood, though. He's willing to say what White wants to hear, then reverse himself, which did not endear him to White.My only gripe is the obvious fiction of presenting what was going through Harvey Milk's mind when he was killed. It's more silly than anything (he apparently associates his murder with Tosca's death), and it hurts the tone of a film that gives at least the illusion of accuracy. It also comes dangerously close to portraying Milk as a martyr.Fine performances all around, especially Penn's and Brolin's. I don't know why people dump on Sean Penn. In this film, he quite disappears into the role. What more do you want from an actor?For those straight viewers uncomfortable not only with men kissing each other, but with male effeminacy... There are all kinds of homosexual men, ranging from transvesites and swishes to men of ordinary (sometimes hyper) masculinity who are not easily recognized. Thirty years ago, the latter tended to remain invisible and not take part in politics. Which is why you don't see many of them in this film.Highly recommended -- especially to those people who ought to see it, but will refuse to.Beautiful Blu-ray transfer.",4,"excellent, but not a ""classic""",1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,2109,"['extremely', 'good', 'film', 'four-star', 'scale', ""'d"", 'give', '3.5', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'been', 'called.As', 'virtually', 'biopic', 'ever', 'made', 'writer', 'obliged', 'create', 'artificial-sounding', 'dialog', 'up', 'what', 'been', 'going', 'prior', 'current', 'scene', 'clumsily', 'character', 'thoughts', 'Milk', 'better', 'most', 'still', 'share.One', 'script', 'good', 'points', 'refusal', 'demonize', 'Dan', 'White', 'who', 'portrayed', 'thoroughly', 'confused', 'unbalanced', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'surprising', 'eventually', 'committed', 'suicide', 'obviously', 'queer-hater', 'one', 'feeling', 'White', 'murder', 'Milk', 'Moscone', 'was', 'primarily', 'more', 'being', 'politically', 'thwarted', 'humiliated', 'Even', 'had', 'conflict', 'not', 'been', 'gay', 'rights', 'probably', 'would', 'killed', 'whomever', 'thought', 'had', 'harmed', 'Moscone', 'was', ""n't"", 'gay', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'nature', 'politics.Harvey', 'Milk', 'have', 'understood', 'though', 'willing', 'say', 'what', 'White', 'hear', 'then', 'reverse', 'did', 'not', 'endear', 'White.My', 'only', 'gripe', 'obvious', 'fiction', 'presenting', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'mind', 'when', 'was', 'killed', 'more', 'silly', 'anything', 'apparently', 'murder', 'Tosca', 'death', 'tone', 'film', 'least', 'illusion', 'accuracy', 'also', 'dangerously', 'close', 'portraying', 'Milk', 'martyr.Fine', 'around', 'especially', 'Penn', 'Brolin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'people', 'dump', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'film', 'quite', 'role', 'What', 'more', 'do', 'want', 'actor', 'straight', 'viewers', 'uncomfortable', 'not', 'only', 'men', 'kissing', 'other', 'male', 'effeminacy', 'are', 'kinds', 'homosexual', 'men', 'ranging', 'transvesites', 'swishes', 'men', 'ordinary', 'sometimes', 'hyper', 'masculinity', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'recognized', 'Thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'latter', 'tended', 'remain', 'invisible', 'not', 'take', 'part', 'politics', 'Which', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'film.Highly', 'recommended', 'especially', 'people', 'who', 'ought', 'see', 'will', 'refuse', 'to.Beautiful', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer']",Milk
