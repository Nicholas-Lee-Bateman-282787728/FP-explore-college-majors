1236697,ABP0RCZCVMRRG,B001TKK3KM,"J. DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[22, 28]","I am hesitant to down-rate this to only three stars, because for what it reveals it is quite good.  But it fails to discuss some critical facts, which reveal Stalin to be quite even more horrific than is already developed, and both Roosevelt and Churchill acting very much in understandable ways.  Through those failures, the DVD reveals that either the author Rees or the producers (or both) had a personal or political axe to grind against the Western Allies.  Here's the specifics.Most centrally important, the entire presentation fails to present with any clarity how Stalin was ruthlessly and systematically slaughtering around 20 million of his own people, both before, during and after the Hitler-Stalin Pact.  It is not an error to say the majority of the Whermacht was ground down by the fierce opposition of Soviet troops, for which the West could be grateful -- one can admire their tenacity and fury of the Russian soldier in that fight.  But one also loses some measure of sympathy for the overall Soviet cause when realizing that once they liberated their own Soviet territory from Nazi hands, the liberated people were typically subjected to ruthless Red Terror, deportation to gulag death-camps, and Inquisitions about how much they were ""contaminated"" by mere contact with the Nazi occupation forces.Churchill certainly knew some of this, and his tiny nation of England was nearly standing alone against Nazi power.  America became their weapons' supplier, but only entered the war in full measure after Pearl Harbor.  Hitler bungled the first cross-channel invasion, the Battle for Britain, and given time to recover his forces, would have eventually found a way to make a successful cross-channel crossing. England would then also have fallen to Hitlerism.  So the desperation to enlist and keep Stalin in the fight against Hitler was intense.  And it was also fully understandable that, as the fight neared conclusion, the West had to confront the fact that the Soviet Monster was quite capable of continuing its westward invasions.Roosevelt on the other hand was quite the American socialist, and was surrounded by Soviet sympathizers.  His running mate for the second term, Henry Wallace, was actually a Soviet mole, exposed only by the end of his third term, when he was replaced by Harry Truman.  So Roosevelt was even more ignorant to the nature of Soviet duplicity and slaughter.  He was no hard communist, but did seem to feel he could ""cut a deal"" with Stalin, without full appreciation it was a Dance with the Devil.Each of these Western elected leaders were trying to protect the interests of their countrymen and of the remaining liberated West European nations.  While it was a terrible that Poland and other East European nations slid under the Stalinist boot-heel, the realistic choices were stark and abysmal.  But to somehow hint or suggest that the blame for that fell upon Churchill or Roosevelt, rather than directly upon Stalin and his henchmen, is outrageous.  Stalin had many millions of Red Army troops, with masses of tanks and aircraft, all battle-hardened and ready for any new battle should the West decide to make a strong point about Polish freedom.  They were not about to give up anything.  The choice was, enter a stale-mate with the Soviets, or continue more bloody war for years to come.  They chose stale-mate, and nearly 50 years of a nuclear-armed stand-off in the Cold War.This point seemed lost in the DVD, which basically erased Stalin's horrific slaughter of his own people, and the massive size and capability of the Red Army starting in late 1944.  It also gives too much theatrical attention to those things which might make Roosevelt and Churchill seem conniving and duplicitous.  One could find more in their biographies of that period showing great personal courage by both leaders, even if, as imperfect human beings we can pick them apart years later, from the safety of our arm-chairs.What is excellent, however, is the exposure of lesser-known elements of the Hitler-Stalin Pact, and so if you know something of the historical period, it will be useful for the documentation on that.  I would also recommendRussia's War: Blood Upon the Snow,Harvest of Despair: The Unknown HolocaustandThe Soviet Storyas additional material relevant to this same ugly period of 20th Century history.",3,"MIX OF FACT, MANY OMISSIONS",1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,4353,"['am', 'hesitant', 'down-rate', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'what', 'quite', 'good', 'discuss', 'critical', 'facts', 'reveal', 'Stalin', 'be', 'quite', 'even', 'more', 'horrific', 'already', 'developed', 'Roosevelt', 'Churchill', 'acting', 'very', 'much', 'understandable', 'ways', 'failures', 'DVD', 'author', 'Rees', 'producers', 'had', 'personal', 'political', 'axe', 'grind', 'Western', 'Allies', 'Here', 'specifics.Most', 'centrally', 'important', 'entire', 'presentation', 'present', 'clarity', 'how', 'Stalin', 'was', 'ruthlessly', 'systematically', 'slaughtering', '20', 'million', 'own', 'people', 'Hitler-Stalin', 'Pact', 'not', 'error', 'say', 'majority', 'Whermacht', 'was', 'ground', 'down', 'fierce', 'opposition', 'Soviet', 'troops', 'West', 'could', 'be', 'grateful', 'one', 'can', 'admire', 'tenacity', 'fury', 'Russian', 'soldier', 'fight', 'one', 'also', 'measure', 'sympathy', 'overall', 'Soviet', 'cause', 'when', 'realizing', 'once', 'liberated', 'own', 'Soviet', 'territory', 'Nazi', 'hands', 'liberated', 'people', 'were', 'typically', 'subjected', 'ruthless', 'Red', 'Terror', 'deportation', 'gulag', 'death-camps', 'Inquisitions', 'how', 'much', 'were', 'contaminated', 'mere', 'contact', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'forces.Churchill', 'certainly', 'knew', 'tiny', 'nation', 'England', 'was', 'nearly', 'standing', 'alone', 'Nazi', 'power', 'America', 'became', 'weapons', 'supplier', 'only', 'entered', 'war', 'full', 'measure', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Hitler', 'bungled', 'first', 'cross-channel', 'invasion', 'Battle', 'Britain', 'given', 'time', 'recover', 'forces', 'would', 'have', 'eventually', 'found', 'way', 'make', 'successful', 'cross-channel', 'crossing', 'England', 'would', 'then', 'also', 'have', 'fallen', 'Hitlerism', 'desperation', 'enlist', 'keep', 'Stalin', 'fight', 'Hitler', 'was', 'intense', 'was', 'also', 'fully', 'understandable', 'that', 'fight', 'neared', 'conclusion', 'West', 'had', 'confront', 'fact', 'Soviet', 'Monster', 'was', 'quite', 'capable', 'continuing', 'westward', 'invasions.Roosevelt', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'quite', 'American', 'socialist', 'was', 'surrounded', 'Soviet', 'sympathizers', 'running', 'mate', 'second', 'term', 'Henry', 'Wallace', 'was', 'actually', 'Soviet', 'mole', 'exposed', 'only', 'end', 'third', 'term', 'when', 'was', 'replaced', 'Harry', 'Truman', 'So', 'Roosevelt', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'ignorant', 'nature', 'Soviet', 'duplicity', 'slaughter', 'was', 'hard', 'communist', 'did', 'seem', 'feel', 'could', 'cut', 'deal', 'Stalin', 'full', 'appreciation', 'was', 'Dance', 'Devil.Each', 'Western', 'elected', 'leaders', 'were', 'trying', 'protect', 'interests', 'countrymen', 'remaining', 'liberated', 'West', 'European', 'nations', 'was', 'terrible', 'Poland', 'other', 'East', 'European', 'nations', 'slid', 'Stalinist', 'boot-heel', 'realistic', 'choices', 'were', 'stark', 'abysmal', 'somehow', 'hint', 'suggest', 'blame', 'fell', 'upon', 'Churchill', 'Roosevelt', 'rather', 'directly', 'Stalin', 'henchmen', 'outrageous', 'Stalin', 'had', 'many', 'millions', 'Red', 'Army', 'troops', 'masses', 'tanks', 'aircraft', 'battle-hardened', 'ready', 'new', 'battle', 'should', 'West', 'decide', 'make', 'strong', 'point', 'Polish', 'freedom', 'were', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'anything', 'choice', 'was', 'enter', 'stale-mate', 'Soviets', 'continue', 'more', 'bloody', 'war', 'years', 'come', 'chose', 'stale-mate', 'nearly', '50', 'years', 'nuclear-armed', 'stand-off', 'Cold', 'War.This', 'point', 'seemed', 'lost', 'DVD', 'basically', 'erased', 'Stalin', 'horrific', 'slaughter', 'own', 'people', 'massive', 'size', 'capability', 'Red', 'Army', 'starting', 'late', '1944', 'also', 'too', 'much', 'theatrical', 'attention', 'things', 'might', 'make', 'Roosevelt', 'Churchill', 'seem', 'conniving', 'duplicitous', 'One', 'could', 'find', 'more', 'biographies', 'period', 'showing', 'great', 'personal', 'courage', 'leaders', 'even', 'imperfect', 'human', 'can', 'pick', 'apart', 'years', 'later', 'safety', 'arm-chairs.What', 'excellent', 'however', 'exposure', 'lesser-known', 'elements', 'Hitler-Stalin', 'Pact', 'so', 'know', 'something', 'historical', 'period', 'will', 'be', 'useful', 'documentation', 'would', 'also', 'recommendRussia', 'War', 'Blood', 'Snow', 'Harvest', 'Despair', 'Unknown', 'HolocaustandThe', 'Soviet', 'Storyas', 'additional', 'material', 'relevant', 'same', 'ugly', 'period', '20th', 'Century', 'history']",World War II: Behind Closed Doors

Russia, under Stalin, did the Lion`s share of the fighting required to defeat Nazi Germany. Never the less Stalin was a brutal dictator who cared not at all about the men and women he sacroffized to achieve that victory.This factual account of WWII tells it like it was, not some whitewashed version geared to please American and British audiences. The betrayal of Poland throughout that war and after it`s end. Not that the Western Allies had much choice, they did not. The free Polish fought heroically with the Western Allies from 1939 until the end. They comprised 20% of the RAF during the battle of Britain and were the troops that took Monte Casino, not the Americans. Polish units lost more than 3,000 dead in that action alone.It also makes note of the fact: That it was the Russian Army that first defeated the Japanese back in 1939 in Manchuria. A fact few historians seem to even be aware of. And that the Russian Army played a crucial role in the surrender of Japan by invading Manchuria in a very large force. The Japanese Army ran for their lives on that front when the Russian Army attacked them. No fight to the death stuff when facing the Russians. They got their butts kicked bigtime in 1939 and 1945 by the Russian Army.The same Russian Army that made a practice of raping women in Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and the other Countries they occupied along with murdering so very many others. It really is hard to say who was the worst: Hitler or Stalin.These are facts most American and British historians either choose to ignore or are unaware of.

It is everything it says it is.  As a kid growing up in the 50s and 60s I knew virtually nothing about Russia's part in WWII.  With this DVD set you will understand better the start of WWII in Europe.  You will understand the deal that Germany worked out with Russia two weeks before the War began.  You will understand the poor Polish people who were just pawns in German and Russian minds.  You see how ruthless both of these countries were.  I now understand the deep hate these countries had for each other during the war.  We lost almost a half million men in WWII; Russia lost almost 30 million people!!  This DVD set makes me thankful that WWII was never fought on the US continent.  Most of us have no idea how much the peoples of Europe suffered during the war.  This series will make you thankful you live in a democracy instead of a country ruled by dictators.  Although the series was not about American involvement in the war, it opened my eyes to all that happened on the ""Eastern Front"".  If you want to understand more about ""why"" the war started, this is a must DVD series.",5,The part of WWII most Americans are not aware of,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,1226,"['started', 'intense', 'review', 'WWII', '2009', 'have', 'viewed', 'several', 'hundred', 'DVDs', 'now', 'spend', 'last', 'weekend', 'looking', 'series', 'everything', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', '50s', '60s', 'knew', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'Russia', 'part', 'WWII', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'understand', 'better', 'start', 'WWII', 'Europe', 'will', 'understand', 'deal', 'Germany', 'worked', 'out', 'Russia', 'two', 'weeks', 'War', 'began', 'will', 'understand', 'poor', 'Polish', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'pawns', 'German', 'Russian', 'minds', 'see', 'how', 'ruthless', 'countries', 'were', 'now', 'understand', 'deep', 'hate', 'countries', 'had', 'other', 'war', 'lost', 'almost', 'half', 'million', 'men', 'WWII', 'Russia', 'lost', 'almost', '30', 'million', 'people', 'DVD', 'set', 'thankful', 'WWII', 'was', 'never', 'fought', 'US', 'continent', 'Most', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'much', 'peoples', 'Europe', 'suffered', 'war', 'series', 'will', 'make', 'thankful', 'live', 'democracy', 'instead', 'country', 'ruled', 'dictators', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'American', 'involvement', 'war', 'opened', 'eyes', 'happened', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'want', 'understand', 'more', 'why', 'war', 'started', 'must', 'DVD', 'series']",World War II: Behind Closed Doors
