But, I'd have to now say that Tommy's is even better. As other's have said in their reviews, they attack a similar ""thing"" from different perspectives.  I think JoJo is more of a technique DVD.  Tommy's is more of a ""let me help you get where you want/need  to be"" DVD.  For JoJo, technique (and the mechanics of different techniques) is the center of the DVD.  For Tommy, improvement, and a level of hand-mastery is the goal.  Techniques and drills are simply the means to get there.This DVD is long.  It will take weeks to months (if you actually play along) to complete it.  That's the whole point.  Unless you're an advanced drummer to begin with, it will take some time to feel comfortable (let alone ""master"") each individual element.  But as you do, you have one more piece of the puzzle that will ultimately become the complete version of the full lifetime exercise.This is not a guy who believes in drills just for drill-sake.  You need only listen to this man play.  I had the good fortune to meet and hear him (with the Birdland Big Band).  The guy is an incredible player.  I can think of NO ONE who is currently better.  Perhaps lots that are as good, but no one better.  Considering the incredible talent out there (Weckl, Gadd, Smith etc etc etc), that's saying a lot.  He plays with speed, power, finesse, but always as a master musician.  He couldn't have accomplished that being just a slave to drills.If you want help in developing your hand technique and facility, and you're looking for a DVD option.

This one doesn't improve things.Let me just describe the first hour of the DVD. Igoe starts by telling us that playing drums is not a competition, that there are lots of drum DVDs on the market, and other opinions that have nothing to do with hand technique. He then proceeds to some useful info on establishing a fulcrum and staying relaxed. We are then shown a few basic patterns to practice loosely. This goes on and on. And on. And on. After a while you'll be saying, ""Ok, I get it. Move on."" Move on Igoe does. He decides to spend another 1/2 hour on the exact same few patterns with five of his students. Bizarrely, he introduces his students one-by-one, noting that they range from ""enthusiast"" (someone no one's ever heard of), to some cat on the New York scene (another someone no one's ever heard of). Apparently the idea is to impress us that this material is applicable to all ranges of drummers. Thanks. I never would have guessed that. The five then proceed to play the same basic patterns in unison. This goes on and on. And on. And on. After a while you'll be saying, ""Ok, I get it. Move on."" As noted, this takes up the entire first hour PLUS of the DVD.Early on, Igoe said if he's going too fast for the viewer they should use the rewind button. I found myself using the fast-forward button.Another missed opportunity for a great hand technique DVD.

1317821,A3DUE5E90OLJRL,B0031SUP26,"w ""aenima3174""","[0, 0]","I have been playing for a long time, and something has always been missing from my playing. Through the years different hand techniques and terms like Moeller were presented to me by my teachers, but I never fully incorporated them in my practice routine. I fiddled with rudiments and got a few of them to sound very good. My singles and doubles were pretty smooth, and my flams were fairly good. I could do a really great swiss army triplet. Yay. I wasn't really incorporating rudiments into my playing though, really breaking them up between the hands and feet. They really didn't all sounded right either, and I wasn't particularly 'loose' when I played them. I probably looked like an anxious frankenstein on some of them. In terms of the bigger picture, I was holding on too tight at least at times where I should have had 'soft' hands ALL THE TIME as Tommy talks about throughout the DVD. If you are a beginner, or someone who has been playing and you want to take your playing to a much more professional level buy this DVD. The information is presented in a simple and concise way. I was never in a drum core or really taught, so I developed my own style which worked pretty well. Until the advent of youtube though I wasn't able to look up videos to repeatedly hear how to play correctly what I had been doing wrong. The issue with youtube though is that it is spotty. Sometimes you find a good video, sometimes not so much. Not only does this video give show you how to make any pattern or rudiment sound even and 'correct', but there are exercises to play with a group of Tommy's students which is fun, a great work out and will expose your weaknesses and ceiling of speed and control. The video is really an encyclopedia of drum hand technique in one place by one true expert.This video is really an amazing set of lifetime lessons for about $30, the cost of about one real lesson. This could take I don't know,  a YEAR at 30 minutes a lesson. I'm not sure how long, but a while. I have been using Jo Jo Mayer's Secret Weapons for the Modern Drummer for a while and it is a great DVD, but I'd absolutely recommend this as a companion. I'd also say to get this first. It has a simpler beginner friendly approach. Any serious drummer should have both though in my opinion. Jo Jo goes into some things that are extremely useful as well, and I think after going through Igoe's video you could move on to that and incorporate some things if you feel the need. I wish I had this video 20 years ago when I was in college. The good news is that if you are someone who has a lot of experience, this DVD can only boost your abilities and make everything you already did better.UPDATE: Work slowly through this DVD, and really get familiar with all the exercises, especially the beginning ones. Don't glaze over anything and really develop the fulcrum and soft, loose feel. Play with the group on the DVD and also alone with a metronome to chart progress. Also, on the DVD is the companion PDF. If you get serious about this DVD and improving your hands, read through the whole thing. What a great resource. What I love about it is that Tommy speaks to all drumming levels, and especially to that guy (me) who has been playing for years and wants to unlearn bad technique and actually correctly learn many of the rudiments and lifetime workout to blend it all into one full-on exercise incorporating everything on the DVD. Some who bought this have said Tommy Igoe talks too much, blah blah blah. I personally like his approach, but if it gets on your nerves there's this thing called fast forward. Also, the main menu really allows you to jump around to very specific sub-sections of the DVD to avoid wasting time. I think that for someone like myself there is a real fear of continued mediocrity with the hope that I will still achieve even a shadow of TI's drum ninja status. I am a drummer who has too often fallen into practice routines of playing familiar concepts without truly addressing my weaknesses. I am probably shortchanging myself to some degree, but you as a drummer know (or should know) your weaknesses and at least be able to visualize a clear path to the much higher level you want to achieve. I truly believe that anyone who works through the sections of this DVD (along with the pdf) and ultimately develops the lifetime warm-up to a high level will improve by leaps and bounds.",5,In Tommy Igoe I Trust.,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,4401,"['have', 'been', 'playing', 'long', 'time', 'something', 'always', 'been', 'missing', 'playing', 'years', 'different', 'hand', 'techniques', 'terms', 'Moeller', 'were', 'presented', 'teachers', 'never', 'fully', 'incorporated', 'practice', 'routine', 'fiddled', 'rudiments', 'got', 'few', 'sound', 'very', 'good', 'singles', 'doubles', 'were', 'pretty', 'smooth', 'flams', 'were', 'fairly', 'good', 'could', 'do', 'really', 'great', 'swiss', 'army', 'triplet', 'Yay', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'incorporating', 'rudiments', 'playing', 'really', 'breaking', 'up', 'hands', 'feet', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'sounded', 'right', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', ""'loose"", 'when', 'played', 'probably', 'looked', 'anxious', 'frankenstein', 'terms', 'bigger', 'picture', 'was', 'holding', 'too', 'tight', 'least', 'times', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'had', ""'soft"", 'hands', 'TIME', 'Tommy', 'talks', 'DVD', 'are', 'beginner', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'playing', 'want', 'take', 'playing', 'much', 'more', 'professional', 'level', 'buy', 'DVD', 'information', 'presented', 'simple', 'concise', 'way', 'was', 'never', 'drum', 'core', 'really', 'taught', 'developed', 'own', 'style', 'worked', 'pretty', 'well', 'advent', 'youtube', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'look', 'up', 'videos', 'repeatedly', 'hear', 'how', 'play', 'correctly', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'wrong', 'issue', 'youtube', 'though', 'spotty', 'Sometimes', 'find', 'good', 'video', 'sometimes', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Not', 'only', 'video', 'give', 'show', 'how', 'make', 'pattern', 'rudiment', 'sound', 'even', ""'correct"", 'are', 'exercises', 'play', 'group', 'Tommy', 'students', 'fun', 'great', 'work', 'out', 'will', 'expose', 'weaknesses', 'ceiling', 'speed', 'control', 'video', 'really', 'encyclopedia', 'drum', 'hand', 'technique', 'one', 'place', 'one', 'true', 'expert.This', 'video', 'really', 'amazing', 'set', 'lifetime', 'lessons', '30', 'cost', 'one', 'real', 'lesson', 'could', 'take', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'YEAR', '30', 'minutes', 'lesson', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'long', 'while', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'Jo', 'Jo', 'Mayer', 'Secret', 'Weapons', 'Modern', 'Drummer', 'while', 'great', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'companion', ""'d"", 'also', 'say', 'get', 'first', 'simpler', 'beginner', 'friendly', 'approach', 'serious', 'drummer', 'should', 'have', 'opinion', 'Jo', 'Jo', 'things', 'are', 'extremely', 'useful', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'going', 'Igoe', 'video', 'could', 'move', 'incorporate', 'things', 'feel', 'need', 'wish', 'had', 'video', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'good', 'news', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'lot', 'experience', 'DVD', 'can', 'only', 'boost', 'abilities', 'make', 'everything', 'already', 'did', 'better.UPDATE', 'Work', 'slowly', 'DVD', 'really', 'get', 'familiar', 'exercises', 'especially', 'beginning', 'ones', 'Do', ""n't"", 'glaze', 'anything', 'really', 'develop', 'fulcrum', 'soft', 'loose', 'feel', 'Play', 'group', 'DVD', 'also', 'alone', 'metronome', 'chart', 'progress', 'Also', 'DVD', 'companion', 'PDF', 'get', 'serious', 'DVD', 'improving', 'hands', 'read', 'whole', 'thing', 'What', 'great', 'resource', 'What', 'love', 'Tommy', 'drumming', 'levels', 'especially', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'playing', 'years', 'unlearn', 'bad', 'technique', 'actually', 'correctly', 'learn', 'many', 'rudiments', 'lifetime', 'workout', 'blend', 'one', 'full-on', 'exercise', 'incorporating', 'everything', 'DVD', 'who', 'bought', 'have', 'said', 'Tommy', 'Igoe', 'talks', 'too', 'much', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'personally', 'approach', 'nerves', 'thing', 'called', 'fast', 'forward', 'Also', 'main', 'menu', 'really', 'jump', 'very', 'specific', 'sub-sections', 'DVD', 'avoid', 'wasting', 'time', 'think', 'someone', 'real', 'fear', 'continued', 'mediocrity', 'hope', 'will', 'still', 'achieve', 'even', 'shadow', 'TI', 'drum', 'ninja', 'status', 'am', 'drummer', 'who', 'too', 'often', 'fallen', 'practice', 'routines', 'playing', 'familiar', 'concepts', 'truly', 'addressing', 'weaknesses', 'am', 'probably', 'shortchanging', 'degree', 'drummer', 'know', 'should', 'know', 'weaknesses', 'least', 'be', 'able', 'visualize', 'clear', 'path', 'much', 'higher', 'level', 'want', 'achieve', 'truly', 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', 'sections', 'DVD', 'pdf', 'ultimately', 'lifetime', 'warm-up', 'high', 'level', 'will', 'improve', 'leaps', 'bounds']",N/A
