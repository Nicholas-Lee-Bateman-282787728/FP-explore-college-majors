1270958,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B002IW8V1I,Michael A. Newman,"[21, 23]","MLB Productions has done their usual great job of producing this perspective of the 2009 World Series and especially, why this championship is so special to the Yankee franchise.  It is themed with the concept of ""27"" which represents how many titles the Yankees have won to date.  It also, plays out how this championship is the first for ""new"" Yankee Stadium and it is the fifth championship for four of the Yankee mainstays from the 1996 teams.  It is obviously a ""must-have"" for any Yankee fan's video library.The main downside to this DVD is much less time is devoted to the losing team (in this case the Phillies) then was the case in most of the WS DVDs of the last 10 years.  Usually, % coverage is about 60-40 for the winning side but in this case it seemed like it was more 80-20.There is the usual coverage of the ups and downs of the two teams during the seasons.  There seemed to be a lot less coverage of the divisional and league series than in prior seasons and the extras on the DVD appear to only be Yankee highlights from the playoffs and WS.  The extras do include a look at each player (as was shown on FOX) on the field individually as the last out was made.Absent from the DVD was any mention of Harry Kalas, the long-time Phillie announcer who passed away and whose suit was kept in the Philly dugout.  This seemed to be a major omission.  There are some priceless interviews with Pedro Martinez and some nice video of Ryan Howard, Chase Utley and Jimmy Rollins.  Jason Werth, a key cog for the Phillies seems to have been away when the interviews were taped.From the Yankee perspective most of the key players are interviewed but very few of the role players (I don't remember Phil Hughes, Brett Gardner, Damaso Marte and a few of the others appearing).A-Rod's health issues at the beginning of the season are highlighted but absent is any mention of the steroid scandal.If you are not a Yankee or Phillies fan, then you may not want to buy this one unless you are a diehard baseball fan.  Being a Yankee fan myself, I couldn't help but give it five stars.",5,"The Perfect ""Gift"" for a Yankee Fan",1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,2081,"['MLB', 'Productions', 'done', 'usual', 'great', 'job', 'producing', 'perspective', '2009', 'World', 'Series', 'especially', 'why', 'championship', 'so', 'special', 'Yankee', 'franchise', 'themed', 'concept', '27', 'how', 'many', 'Yankees', 'have', 'won', 'date', 'also', 'out', 'how', 'championship', 'first', 'new', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'fifth', 'championship', 'four', 'Yankee', 'mainstays', '1996', 'teams', 'obviously', 'must-have', 'Yankee', 'fan', 'video', 'library.The', 'main', 'downside', 'DVD', 'much', 'less', 'time', 'devoted', 'losing', 'team', 'case', 'Phillies', 'then', 'was', 'case', 'most', 'WS', 'DVDs', 'last', '10', 'years', 'Usually', '%', 'coverage', '60-40', 'winning', 'side', 'case', 'seemed', 'was', 'more', '80-20.There', 'usual', 'coverage', 'ups', 'downs', 'two', 'teams', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'less', 'coverage', 'divisional', 'league', 'series', 'prior', 'seasons', 'extras', 'DVD', 'appear', 'only', 'be', 'Yankee', 'highlights', 'playoffs', 'WS', 'extras', 'do', 'include', 'look', 'player', 'was', 'shown', 'FOX', 'field', 'individually', 'last', 'out', 'was', 'made.Absent', 'DVD', 'was', 'mention', 'Harry', 'Kalas', 'long-time', 'Phillie', 'announcer', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'suit', 'was', 'kept', 'Philly', 'dugout', 'seemed', 'be', 'major', 'omission', 'are', 'priceless', 'interviews', 'Pedro', 'Martinez', 'nice', 'video', 'Ryan', 'Howard', 'Chase', 'Utley', 'Jimmy', 'Rollins', 'Jason', 'Werth', 'key', 'cog', 'Phillies', 'have', 'been', 'away', 'when', 'interviews', 'were', 'Yankee', 'perspective', 'most', 'key', 'players', 'are', 'interviewed', 'very', 'few', 'role', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Phil', 'Hughes', 'Brett', 'Gardner', 'Damaso', 'Marte', 'few', 'others', 'appearing', '.A-Rod', 'health', 'issues', 'beginning', 'season', 'are', 'highlighted', 'absent', 'mention', 'steroid', 'scandal.If', 'are', 'not', 'Yankee', 'Phillies', 'fan', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'buy', 'one', 'are', 'diehard', 'baseball', 'fan', 'Being', 'Yankee', 'fan', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'give', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

So recently I thought I should get the 2009 world series dvd.It was good thing I did, the documentary thats on it has improved a lot since the 2000 one. It feels more of a documentary then clips with someone talking and interviews. Yes the documentary has that but it also has tibits on certain games, a little more on the road both the Yankees and Phillies took that got them to the world series.The dvd has some special features...but dont expect much.
