This made it pale in comparison.This season starts off with Finch testing the Machine, setting it up. From there, throughout the season, you witness Finch testing its angles of sight, find out how it could be used for good and evil. You also witness Finch's relationship with Alice from the beginning (kinda creepy for a man-made machine to gain sentient intelligence and play matchmaker...). Yet, there is so much more behind the conspiracy of the numbers, the methods to the Machine's madness. Speaking of which, at first, the episodic mysteries seem alone, but they intertwine into the overarching mystery of the machine, especially towards the end when secrets are revealed about he machine's intention.The first few episodes revealed excellent storytelling in an overarching mystery: the real truth and history of expert hacker Root, what her initials ""HR"" really mean, and why she is why she is like. From screenwriters who know what they're doing, in the end of that mystery, I was unashamed to cry at the overall impact of a mystery solved. Between that and a further mystery is all the expected single-episode mysteries. And the dry humor. And the introspective perspectives on what it means to be human.Once in a while, throughout this season, I did get the chills from devastating secrets, as well as the nature of how those secrets get revealed. Not your typical storytelling. Not to mention, with the use of technology and the possibilities of how our tech gets used as spy technology throughout and how hackers can be so thorough in their methods even outside computers, I agree with what one top reviewer said, this show is extremely risky.Premise, set up, execution, style, personality, originality, scary realism, etc.It's no wonder I have extreme pickiness in what I prefer watching. It's no wonder I fell in love with this show in its first season.Oh, and in the last couple episodes, not only does Sarah Shahi's minor role become a pleasant surprise (after her role in Supernatural's pilot episode and deent characterization in Life, it's easy to recognize her), the way the Machine seems to become sentient actually gets rather spine-chilling for me.Can't wait to see how the story gets furthered in the next season.",5,Conspiracies from the start,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,2292,"['thought', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'crazy', 'good', 'complex', 'made', 'comparison.This', 'season', 'off', 'Finch', 'testing', 'Machine', 'setting', 'up', 'there', 'season', 'witness', 'Finch', 'testing', 'angles', 'sight', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'good', 'evil', 'also', 'witness', 'Finch', 'relationship', 'Alice', 'beginning', 'kinda', 'creepy', 'man-made', 'machine', 'gain', 'sentient', 'intelligence', 'play', 'matchmaker', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'conspiracy', 'numbers', 'methods', 'Machine', 'madness', 'Speaking', 'first', 'episodic', 'mysteries', 'seem', 'alone', 'intertwine', 'overarching', 'mystery', 'machine', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'machine', 'intention.The', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'revealed', 'excellent', 'storytelling', 'overarching', 'mystery', 'real', 'truth', 'history', 'expert', 'hacker', 'Root', 'what', 'initials', 'HR', 'really', 'mean', 'why', 'why', 'like', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'end', 'mystery', 'was', 'unashamed', 'cry', 'overall', 'impact', 'mystery', 'solved', 'further', 'mystery', 'expected', 'single-episode', 'mysteries', 'dry', 'humor', 'introspective', 'perspectives', 'what', 'be', 'human.Once', 'while', 'season', 'did', 'get', 'chills', 'devastating', 'secrets', 'as', 'well', 'nature', 'how', 'secrets', 'get', 'revealed', 'Not', 'typical', 'storytelling', 'Not', 'mention', 'use', 'technology', 'possibilities', 'how', 'tech', 'used', 'spy', 'technology', 'how', 'hackers', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'thorough', 'methods', 'even', 'computers', 'agree', 'what', 'one', 'top', 'reviewer', 'said', 'show', 'extremely', 'risky.Premise', 'set', 'up', 'execution', 'style', 'personality', 'originality', 'scary', 'realism', 'etc.It', 'wonder', 'have', 'extreme', 'pickiness', 'what', 'prefer', 'watching', 'wonder', 'fell', 'love', 'show', 'first', 'season.Oh', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'not', 'only', 'Sarah', 'Shahi', 'minor', 'role', 'become', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'role', 'Supernatural', 'pilot', 'episode', 'deent', 'characterization', 'Life', 'easy', 'recognize', 'way', 'Machine', 'become', 'sentient', 'actually', 'rather', 'spine-chilling', 'me.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'story', 'furthered', 'next', 'season']",N/A

At first the pair are a bit distrustful of each other, but as the series moves along, their relationship develops into a deep friendship with each other and with the two police officers they eventually begin to work with for their common cause.

Perhaps the best on network TV.Starting with Jim Caviezel (John Reese) and Michael Emerson (Harold Finch).Who can forget Kevin Chapman (former Providence Irish mob boss) and the corrupt cop Lionel Fusco (offered a chance at redemption by Reese).Thrown into the mix are a trifecta of hotties with recurring roles:1.) Joss Whedon alum Amy Acker, as elite hacker with an agenda, ""Root""2.) Fixer and sometime Reese love interest ""Zoe"" played by Paige Turco3.) Less us not forget Sarah Shahi playing somewhat out of character as, stoic & burned former goverment assassin, ""Samantha Shaw"" Admittedly, I had hopes that we would at least catch Shahi coming out of cold shower!Now for the boys.  Enrico Colantoni (Flash Point and Veronica Mars alum) as imprisoned mob boss Elias. Surprisingly endearing and adding some comic relief is Leon Tao (Ken Leung), as the often troubled financial hacker who sometimes assists in cases.OK, so with a great cast, why not 5*?  The culprit is the writing/script.  IMHO, season 2 is much superior to season 1.  Starting with episode 14 (season 2) the script catches up with the 5* cast.  There is intrigue on several levels with Root (Acker) meeting Shaw (Shahi) in episode 16.  Episode 19 may just be the best episode of the series with several storylines coming together.  Elias admits that some outside force is posturing to take him out, Shaw re-emerges and decides that she will go after Root for some answers and then there is the re-emergence of the mysterious Englishman who is a point person for a shadowy organization, which has yet to be revealed.I am very exited for the final 3-episodes of the season.

It is the kind of show that probably is better watched in order because there are a lot of side plots that get carried from episode to episode. However, there are plenty of stand alone stories that are fun.Favorite episodes:""Triggerman"" (#4) - A story about a couple that's as star-crossed as they come. Reese and Harold with timely assists from Carter and Fusko work to save a ""bad guy"" who's risking his life to save an innocent woman.""Shadow Box"" (#10) - The story features Reese trying to help the sister of a fallen US soldier and her boyfriend when they get caught up in a dangerous match against a rather ruthless gentleman. This sets off a slightly longer plight arc for our hero.""2piR"" (#11)- Reese's recent troubles make it necessary for Harold to take more of a hands-on approach to this next person of interest, a genius teen with a troubled past.""Booked Solid"" (#15) - A hotel maid who saw some horrible things as a teen is hunted by those who definitely don't want her speaking out against the perpetrator of those past crimes. This episode has pretty much all the earmarks of a typical P.O.I. episode.""God mode"" (season finale, #22) - The intervening episodes dig a lot deeper into the wider conspiracy, which I found somewhat tedious. However, the finale was satisfying in the sense that they went out of their way to get some big stunts in.Disappointments: They sort of stretched in many places to get Carter and Fusco involved. They both have their own troubles, but it felt like the writers had these characters spinning their wheels through much of the season. Kara was never my favorite character, but I'm not a huge fan of Shaw either. Hopefully, that will change in the third season. I love Amy Acker, but I find her character, Root, annoying. Since she's in a lot of episodes (relatively speaking), I get mixed feelings about those episodes.Conclusion: It's still a great show. I like that there aren't always clearcut good/bad guys.

It's a nuanced series of tightly plotted stories with a running series of subplots that slowly build from the beginnning.  The individual stories are not always what they seem - from the outset, the viewer knows that not all the people Reese and Finch try to help are victims - quite often, they are the perps that Reese has to stop before they commit whatever crime they have planned.Of course, there are some clunkers but even the bad shows are superior to a lot of the dreck currently being aired on TV - broadcast or cable.Before the show premiered, Jonathan Nolan, the series creator, called it Batman without the cape.  And, like all good hero/anti-hero franchises, this show has its own support 'family' as well as a marvelous rogues gallery with some enemies fixed seemingly permantently in the mythos and others appearing and eventually being handled.  Some, such as Elias, a mob boss out to control the NY rackets, start to slip into the show with mentions episodes before the character appears.Many of these allies and rogues carry on into the new season which successfully opened with the resolution to the season 1 cliffhanger.

Fortunately, unlike producer JJ Abram's earlier success &#34;Lost&#34;, this are much more defined & explain more - propelling the episode along.  (I love &#34;Lost&#34; but the flashbacks and flashforwards did get a bit confusing.)I watched season 1 again then season 2 before season 3 premiered (several mini-marathons involved).

I'm assuming the reader of these comments has seen all of Season 1 and has a firm grip on the plotting threads that wind there way throught this intriguing show. In order to fully enjoy the continuation of this fascinating story take the time to read the Wikipedia article on ""Person of Interest"".I will repeat myself because I feel strongly about this point - in my oppinion it is essential that the viewer have a clear knowledge of Season 1 to appreciate Season 2. Characters surface and then disappear for an episode or two only to reappear and play a key role later in the story.The complex interwoven story of Harold Finch and the origins of the Machine, who built it, how it works and exactly where it's located is just one of the threads that weave through this series in greater details in season 2.New opponents of Reese and Finch are developed, time-line background details start to make more sense and enemies from season 1 keep coming back, specifically Root, HR and Elias.Detectives Carter and Fusco continue to play pivotal roles in each episode.This is one of the most confoundedly interesting shows I have ever viewed and am looking forward to the season 3 set when it is released.On a personal note I cannot be at the mercy of juggled TV schedules and absolutely abhor commercials so I watch this and several other series on DVD where I can control when I see the shows and avoid the ads. One grip I have concerning POI is that the DVD's do not include any deleted or extended scenes. I just know they are ""somewhere"" and cannot understand why they are not included.

The core actors continue to work well together--Jim Caviezel carries the action as the ex-Army/ex-CIA operative Reese; Michael Emerson may be the most uncomfortable looking hero in the history of television as Finch; Taraji P. Henson is great as the driven dectective Carter, and Chapman continues to give heart and soul to the formerly dirty cop Fusco.This is the season where the universe of Reese and Finch expand in terms of the characters around them.  In the present day sequences, there's Zoe Morgan, the ""fixer"" who seems to have a passing interest in Reese.  Paige Turco gives a lot of fun to that role, and she's still incredibly pretty.  Ken Leung (Yep--another graduate of ""Lost"") has recurring turns as the grifter Leon Tao.  We cannot--just cannot--forget Bear, the Belgian Malinois that Reese takes from an Aryan Brotherhood in the Season 2 season opener, and wins EVERYONE--especially Finch--over.  The relationship everyone has with Bear...is one of the subtle points of humor this series has, along with Reese's dry quips and Fusco going on New York blast.  We understand the enemies of Reese and Finch at this point.  Enrico Colantoni's Carl Elias seems to evolve from enemy to gray area/support--the ""I'll scratch your back, you scratch my back"" relationship--with Reese and Finch; but HR--the group of corrupt cops most embodied by Robert John Burke's Patrick Simmons and Clarke Peters' Alonzo Quinn--increasingly push their way to the being the most enduring enemy of the series thus far.  Reese's CIA backstory wraps up in this season, so the Mark Snow/Kara Stanton (Michael Kelly and Annie Parisse) storyline ends...for now.What we get this year are two subjects--an increase in the telling of the backstory of Finch; how Harold and his business partner Nathan Ingram (Brett Cullen) invented The Machine and how Ingram first understood the importance of the non-relevant numbers, subsequently originating the proactive approach to preventing crimes that Harold was drawn into, and how Finch's newfound purpose ended up affecting his relationship with Grace Hendricks (Played by Emerson's wife, Carrie Preston).  The second storyline is the organization The Machine is tasked to--the ISA--taking in interest in the activities of The Man In The Suit, and looking to eliminate him.  Jay O. Sanders as Special Counsel--the person overseeing The Machine--gives a lot of nasty to the role, and Boris McGiver as the ISA hitman Hirsh is stone-cold.Amy Acker returns late in the season as the unstable Samantha Groves--Root--who believes that she and The Machine have some sort of special relationship (She might not be wrong), and Sarah Shahi is introduced as the former ISA operative Samantha Shaw.  I've always liked Shahi, who hasn't been afraid to play away from her looks as an actress.  In Shaw, Shahi plays a slightly unbalanced former spy who might be a little too trigger-happy for Finch...and for Reese.  Both Acker and Shahi have become part of the Season 3 regular cast.Overall, the storyline of ""POI"" seems to fill both in the present day and with the flashbacks.  How the flashbacks are introduced leads to part of the ""delicious discomfort"" of the series--the feeling of being watched while watching how things develop.

Chapman's Lionel Fusco is wonderful as a corrupt cop trying to repent and reform while saving him from his dark past is slowly corrupting Carter as their associate.

Of course, it is not really fair to compare TV and movie writing. Movie scripting is much, much harder than TV scripting. A movie writer must do so much in a few hours whereas a TV writer is not pressed by the same economics of time constraints. However, TV writers are getting better and better whereas movie writers of great talent are so rare as to be almost non-existent. Person of Interest obviously has a great writing team. But despite my opinions about writers, and they are opinions, it is the writing on this show which gives the actors such a great country to bring to life. And they bring it to life!!! The universe being created by the writers and actors of Person of Interest is truly interesting and timely. But my last words are for the actors. The two leads are superb.
