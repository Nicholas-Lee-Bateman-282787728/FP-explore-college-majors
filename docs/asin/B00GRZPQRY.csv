Their timing and delivery is really good.Almost voice matching the seiyuu. There is no drop in the audio quality at all when I switch from japanese to english or vise versa. They picked the right voice talents for it, although Sam Regal voice is just a tad too deep for Shiro...but its ok, they sounded very natural in their lines.I can tell they took a bit of effort in picking the right voice talents for the role becuase almost all of them are spot on .Its almost the same team that did Tiger and Bunny , the ADR on that was amazing too.I really enjoyed watching the ADR version. Thank you ADR staff.I saw the movie sequel and that was awesome . I would buy the american release when the ADR work is done on that one too LOL.",4,I am happy with it,1405728000,"07 19, 2014",2014,1148,"['would', 'have', 'been', '5', 'stars', 'writting', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'messy', 'middle', 'end', 'show', 'felt', 'rushedBut', 'animation', 'characters', 'seiyuu', 'background', 'music', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'work', 'are', '5', 'stars', 'me.As', 'ADR', 'work', 'am', 'happy', 'it.As', 'anime', 'fan', 'who', 'japanese', 'first', 'trained', 'voice', 'actor', 'actor', 'am', 'really', 'happy', 'effort', 'put', 'ADR', 'timing', 'delivery', 'really', 'good.Almost', 'voice', 'matching', 'seiyuu', 'drop', 'audio', 'quality', 'when', 'switch', 'japanese', 'english', 'vise', 'versa', 'picked', 'right', 'voice', 'talents', 'Sam', 'Regal', 'voice', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'deep', 'Shiro', 'ok', 'sounded', 'very', 'natural', 'lines.I', 'can', 'tell', 'took', 'bit', 'effort', 'picking', 'right', 'voice', 'talents', 'role', 'becuase', 'almost', 'are', 'spot', '.Its', 'almost', 'same', 'team', 'did', 'Tiger', 'Bunny', 'ADR', 'was', 'amazing', 'too.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'ADR', 'version', 'Thank', 'ADR', 'staff.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'sequel', 'was', 'awesome', 'would', 'buy', 'american', 'release', 'when', 'ADR', 'work', 'done', 'one', 'too', 'LOL']",N/A

1680236,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B00GRZPQRY,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[5, 8]",I was so completely mesmerized by the animation of K and have to recommend this series to all anime fans to see at least once. For me it is a series to collect since the story despite it only having 13 episodes did a good job of making us attached to the characters and then the opening and ending theme songs were so beautiful.Check out more anime reviews: The Huge Anime Fan via Wordpress,5,K and the animation,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,390,"['was', 'so', 'completely', 'mesmerized', 'animation', 'K', 'have', 'recommend', 'series', 'anime', 'fans', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'series', 'collect', 'story', 'only', 'having', '13', 'episodes', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'attached', 'characters', 'then', 'opening', 'ending', 'theme', 'songs', 'were', 'so', 'beautiful.Check', 'out', 'more', 'anime', 'reviews', 'Huge', 'Anime', 'Fan', 'Wordpress']",N/A
1680237,A28I728U6VJ8TZ,B00GRZPQRY,Chaotic,"[1, 1]","It seemed like there was a lot of hype leading up to this series, I'm not sure that it met all of my expectations though... As far as the pros, the art is breathtaking and is on par with what I would expect from a blu-ray, however the story left something to be desired. I really liked the concept, however I'm not sure I liked the execution of the content. Don't get me wrong, this is a good series that is better than some that I have seen, however I would have liked to see it be longer. This series will keep you in the dark until about the last 3 episodes, so be prepared for that. All in all, worth the money that was charged. The general premise is our protagonist is accused of a murder that he insists that he did not commit, and the story revolves around him and his journey to prove his innocence. Some characters have some pretty interesting powers, and some of the fight scenes are cool, but I would have expected more blood from the violence that is suggested. Not really any fanservice so that will please certain individuals.",4,K Series,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1041,"['seemed', 'was', 'lot', 'hype', 'leading', 'up', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'met', 'expectations', 'though', 'As', 'far', 'pros', 'art', 'breathtaking', 'par', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'blu-ray', 'however', 'story', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'really', 'liked', 'concept', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'liked', 'execution', 'content', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'series', 'better', 'have', 'seen', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'be', 'longer', 'series', 'will', 'keep', 'dark', 'last', '3', 'episodes', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'money', 'was', 'charged', 'general', 'premise', 'protagonist', 'accused', 'murder', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'story', 'journey', 'prove', 'innocence', 'characters', 'have', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'powers', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'cool', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'more', 'blood', 'violence', 'suggested', 'Not', 'really', 'fanservice', 'so', 'that', 'will', 'please', 'certain', 'individuals']",N/A

1680240,AMYSV3PZLNDCS,B00GRZPQRY,Just some old guy.,"[1, 2]",It is in English and you will hear voices that you have heard before...Sam Regal is the lead character. Sam Regal also was the the character &#34;Shiro&#34; in Fate Stay Night. This time he is also Shiro...I heard the voice of the person whom played Kai in Blood + as well.As far as the animation goes it is the same as Mardock Scramble...I heard it was the same studio and that is why it was taking Mardock Scramble so long to be made. Vibrant colors with richly detailed environments are the main in every episode. It was lacking a little on some explainations but none the less still a very likeable show.Shiro is suspected of being a murderer...there is even a video of the killer and it looks just like him. Yet Shiro swears he was at school at the time of this murder meanwhile there are people out to kill him because of this video. One such person finds Shiro and until he can prove that Shiro is or isnt the murderer he will not let him out of his sight. If Shiro is indeed quilty...he will kill him on the spot.So while trying to evade those who are after him...Shiro tries to piece together the puzzle of whom this person is in the video.My brief discription really does not do it justice but it is a very good show. I had seen it before and once I found out it was in English I bought it.,4,English Version.,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,1300,"['English', 'will', 'hear', 'voices', 'have', 'heard', 'Sam', 'Regal', 'lead', 'character', 'Sam', 'Regal', 'also', 'was', 'character', '34', 'Shiro', '34', 'Fate', 'Stay', 'Night', 'time', 'also', 'Shiro', 'heard', 'voice', 'person', 'whom', 'played', 'Kai', 'Blood', '+', 'well.As', 'far', 'animation', 'same', 'Mardock', 'Scramble', 'heard', 'was', 'same', 'studio', 'why', 'was', 'taking', 'Mardock', 'Scramble', 'so', 'long', 'be', 'made', 'Vibrant', 'colors', 'richly', 'detailed', 'environments', 'are', 'main', 'episode', 'was', 'lacking', 'little', 'explainations', 'none', 'less', 'still', 'very', 'likeable', 'show.Shiro', 'suspected', 'being', 'murderer', 'even', 'video', 'killer', 'just', 'Shiro', 'swears', 'was', 'school', 'time', 'murder', 'meanwhile', 'are', 'people', 'kill', 'video', 'One', 'such', 'person', 'finds', 'Shiro', 'can', 'prove', 'Shiro', 'isnt', 'murderer', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'sight', 'Shiro', 'indeed', 'quilty', 'will', 'kill', 'spot.So', 'trying', 'evade', 'who', 'are', 'Shiro', 'piece', 'together', 'puzzle', 'whom', 'person', 'video.My', 'brief', 'discription', 'really', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'had', 'seen', 'once', 'found', 'was', 'English', 'bought']",N/A
