I was at my best friend's house when we saw this and as the film progressed I was really impressed by the films character development, the acting performances, the politics of the day and the love triangle was so well told that it kept my best friend's attention and my mine. Now the film does is slow passed and might bore some people, but that all aside it is a fun film to watch. But again if your looking for a shoot em up don't bother. To conclude I will say this, I do recommend it. It is well done for a TV show that aired in the 80s. It's really too bad that today we do not have any western TV shows.",4,Wrangler - a fansintating story,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,754,"['Dear', 'reader', 'allow', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'western', 'genre', 'film', 'seemed', 'attracting', 'mainly', 'awesome', 'cover', 'art', 'was', 'best', 'friend', 'house', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'progressed', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'films', 'character', 'development', 'acting', 'performances', 'politics', 'day', 'love', 'triangle', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'kept', 'best', 'friend', 'attention', 'mine', 'Now', 'film', 'slow', 'passed', 'might', 'bore', 'people', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'again', 'looking', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'conclude', 'will', 'say', 'do', 'recommend', 'well', 'done', 'TV', 'show', 'aired', '80s', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'today', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'western', 'TV', 'shows']",Wrangler VHS

Kind of a sweet little movie, till our virginal heroine suddenly falls into bed after clearly establishing that she is not that kind of girl.I was surprised at the authenticity of costumes, etc.  Something about horses makes any movie more majestic.It was not as strong as I would have liked.  The movie business is a competitive one, and it seems a waste to put all that money and energy into something that doesn't grab you in some way and keep you watching.It's gotta be more than just the blue eyes.",4,"Australian scenery, horses, Fahey scenery, what more could you want?",1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,571,"['young', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'reviewed', 'Kind', 'sweet', 'little', 'movie', 'till', 'virginal', 'heroine', 'suddenly', 'bed', 'clearly', 'establishing', 'not', 'kind', 'girl.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'authenticity', 'costumes', 'etc', 'Something', 'horses', 'movie', 'more', 'majestic.It', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'business', 'competitive', 'one', 'waste', 'put', 'money', 'energy', 'something', ""n't"", 'grab', 'way', 'keep', 'watching.It', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'blue', 'eyes']",Wrangler VHS
