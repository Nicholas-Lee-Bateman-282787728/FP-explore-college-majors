691184,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B000060MTZ,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[1, 1]","This was filmed at the Hi-Fi Ampitheatre in Third Day's home town of Atlanta, before a packed crowd. Overall, it is a wonderful rock, praise and worship concert dvd, that gives you a good feeling. It begins by showing the band getting ready for the show. The dvd contains some documentary elements in between the song performances. After performing their first few songs, there is documentary tour of their tour bus to let you know what it's like living in a tour bus. Some highlights I noticed included the following:  The performance of the song:""You're Everywhere"" is an excellent praise and worship song,and the band ends the performance with a prayer thanking Jesus for dying for us,so we can be saved, and praising Jesus for rising from the dead on the Third Day. This is followed by ""King of Glory"" which continues the praise and worship and includes a prayer by the band of respecting the Name of Jesus. The crowd joins in singing this song. During another documentary break, the band shows and describes their guitars. The performance of ""Consuming Fire"" contains excellent 3 guitar and bass guitar work. During ""My Hope is in You"" the band has the audience introduce themselves to each other and are instructed to love each other as Jesus has taught us. The band calls the audience the ""Church of God"". The praise and worship songs continue, and there is another documentary break, where fans are interviewed as they arrive at the concert. The fans are full of excitement about the rock, praise and worship format of Third Day concerts, plus the fans are excited this concert is in Atlanta, the band's home town. Towards the end of the concert, after the band performs ""I have decided to follow Jesus"",the lead singer talks about how exciting it is when the Atlanta Braves win a baseball game. He then states it is exciting that Jesus has won and has defeated our enemy. He quotes some bible verses about following Christ, and leads the audience into singing the song ""I have decided to follow Jesus"" again. The band leaves the stage with the crowd singing this song. It leaves you with a good feeling. After the concert, the band shares information on the ""World Vision"" program about helping starving children throughout the world. Overall, this is a great concert dvd, it has some excellent guitar rock music along with a great gospel message.",4,"Third Day ""The Offerings Experience"" Live Concert",1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,2356,"['was', 'filmed', 'Hi-Fi', 'Ampitheatre', 'Third', 'Day', 'home', 'town', 'Atlanta', 'packed', 'crowd', 'Overall', 'wonderful', 'rock', 'praise', 'worship', 'concert', 'dvd', 'good', 'feeling', 'showing', 'band', 'getting', 'ready', 'show', 'dvd', 'documentary', 'elements', 'song', 'performances', 'performing', 'first', 'few', 'songs', 'documentary', 'tour', 'tour', 'bus', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'living', 'tour', 'bus', 'highlights', 'noticed', 'included', 'following', 'performance', 'song', ""'re"", 'Everywhere', 'excellent', 'praise', 'worship', 'song', 'band', 'performance', 'prayer', 'thanking', 'Jesus', 'dying', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'praising', 'Jesus', 'rising', 'dead', 'Third', 'Day', 'followed', 'King', 'Glory', 'praise', 'worship', 'prayer', 'band', 'respecting', 'Name', 'Jesus', 'crowd', 'singing', 'song', 'documentary', 'break', 'band', 'shows', 'describes', 'guitars', 'performance', 'Consuming', 'Fire', 'excellent', '3', 'guitar', 'bass', 'guitar', 'work', 'Hope', 'band', 'audience', 'introduce', 'other', 'are', 'instructed', 'love', 'other', 'Jesus', 'taught', 'band', 'audience', 'Church', 'God', 'praise', 'worship', 'songs', 'continue', 'documentary', 'break', 'where', 'fans', 'are', 'interviewed', 'arrive', 'concert', 'fans', 'are', 'full', 'excitement', 'rock', 'praise', 'worship', 'format', 'Third', 'Day', 'fans', 'are', 'excited', 'concert', 'Atlanta', 'band', 'home', 'town', 'end', 'concert', 'band', 'have', 'decided', 'follow', 'Jesus', 'lead', 'singer', 'talks', 'how', 'exciting', 'when', 'Atlanta', 'Braves', 'win', 'baseball', 'game', 'then', 'exciting', 'Jesus', 'won', 'defeated', 'enemy', 'bible', 'verses', 'following', 'Christ', 'audience', 'singing', 'song', 'have', 'decided', 'follow', 'Jesus', 'again', 'band', 'stage', 'crowd', 'singing', 'song', 'good', 'feeling', 'concert', 'band', 'shares', 'information', 'World', 'Vision', 'program', 'helping', 'starving', 'children', 'world', 'Overall', 'great', 'concert', 'dvd', 'excellent', 'guitar', 'rock', 'music', 'great', 'gospel', 'message']",N/A
691185,AT4ONNJ7NMBRW,B000060MTZ,Ichikoh,"[5, 5]","Wow, what can I say about this DVD!  Makes me want to be there live.  But Third Day is probably the best rock band out there, even if they are a Christian band.  They been playing together for a while and they can still rock for all you Gomers.  This particular DVD has all the classic worship songs from the earlier albums.Mac Powell has a unique voice, a very distinct tone that could be recognized.  Brad Avery is the BEST guitarist/distortionist ever and his skills blow me away.  Mark Lee is also a talented and great guitar player also.  Tai Anderson is phenomenal on the bass, I being a bass player, try to play his style.  And Dave Carr is the drummer and the way he plays is very powerful.  Overall great DVD, great songs, and a great band, go and get all their DVDs, like this one, ""Come Together"", and ""Live Wire"".",5,Worship at its best!,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,825,"['Wow', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'DVD', 'Makes', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'live', 'Third', 'Day', 'probably', 'best', 'rock', 'band', 'there', 'even', 'are', 'Christian', 'band', 'been', 'playing', 'together', 'while', 'can', 'still', 'rock', 'Gomers', 'particular', 'DVD', 'classic', 'worship', 'songs', 'earlier', 'albums.Mac', 'Powell', 'unique', 'voice', 'very', 'distinct', 'tone', 'could', 'be', 'recognized', 'Brad', 'Avery', 'BEST', 'guitarist/distortionist', 'ever', 'skills', 'away', 'Mark', 'Lee', 'also', 'talented', 'great', 'guitar', 'player', 'also', 'Tai', 'Anderson', 'phenomenal', 'bass', 'being', 'bass', 'player', 'try', 'play', 'style', 'Dave', 'Carr', 'drummer', 'way', 'very', 'powerful', 'Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'great', 'songs', 'great', 'band', 'go', 'get', 'DVDs', 'one', 'Come', 'Together', 'Live', 'Wire']",N/A

The mix of studio tracks and live recordings on both &quot;Offerings&quot; &amp; &quot;Offerings II: All I Have To Give&quot; made the experience of worshipping God through song come alive like never before.  And now that experience has been captured on film for this DVD.  Some of the musical highlights include &quot;I've Always Loved You,&quot; &quot;King of Glory,&quot; &quot;Thief,&quot; &quot;My Hope is You,&quot; &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; and, of course, &quot;Your Love Oh Lord.&quot;  The documentary segments are interesting and, at times, hilarious.  My only disappointment is that a couple of songs which I would have loved to have seen included weren't, such as the tear jerker ballad &quot;Love Song.&quot;  And I really would have loved to have seen a live performance of their cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Saved&quot; (one of my favorite tracks from the first &quot;Offerings&quot; CD).  Altogether, &quot;The Offerings Experience&quot; is a great representation of 3D's live show--especially the worship experience.",5,An excellent worship experience.,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,1200,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Third', 'Day', 'music', '1997', 'when', 'first', 'bought', 'quot', 'Conspiracy', 'No', '5', 'quot', 'was', 'first', 'quot', 'Offerings', 'quot', 'made', 'fan', 'life', 'mix', 'studio', 'tracks', 'live', 'recordings', 'quot', 'Offerings', 'quot', 'amp', 'quot', 'II', 'Have', 'Give', 'quot', 'made', 'experience', 'worshipping', 'God', 'song', 'come', 'alive', 'never', 'now', 'experience', 'been', 'captured', 'film', 'DVD', 'musical', 'highlights', 'include', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'Always', 'Loved', 'quot', 'quot', 'King', 'Glory', 'quot', 'quot', 'Thief', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hope', 'quot', 'quot', 'Agnus', 'Dei', 'quot', 'course', 'quot', 'Love', 'Oh', 'Lord.', 'quot', 'documentary', 'segments', 'are', 'interesting', 'times', 'hilarious', 'only', 'disappointment', 'couple', 'songs', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'included', 'were', ""n't"", 'such', 'tear', 'jerker', 'ballad', 'quot', 'Love', 'Song.', 'quot', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'performance', 'cover', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'quot', 'Saved', 'quot', 'one', 'favorite', 'tracks', 'first', 'quot', 'Offerings', 'quot', 'CD', 'Altogether', 'quot', 'Offerings', 'Experience', 'quot', 'great', 'representation', '3D', 'live', 'show', 'especially', 'worship', 'experience']",N/A

When I watched this DVD for the first time, I was absolutely blown away by the band's heart for worshipping God.  These guys don't just put on an act, they are the real deal!  My favorite songs off of the DVD are as follows:&quot;Took My Place&quot;-A good song to get the crowd moving and excited!&quot;I've Always Loved You&quot;-A song that tells us that even though we may stumble and fall, God still loves us and always will!&quot;My Hope Is You&quot;-The testimony that Mac Powell gives during this song will want to make you shout!All in all, you will not be disappointed with this DVD--GO BUY IT NOW!",5,TOTALLY AWESOME DVD!,1057190400,"07 3, 2003",2003,767,"['became', 'fan', 'Third', 'Day', 'last', 'year', 'someone', 'gave', 'copy', 'first', 'quot', 'Offerings', 'quot', 'CD', 'was', 'immediatley', 'hooked', 'bands', 'music', 'When', 'watched', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'absolutely', 'blown', 'away', 'band', 'heart', 'worshipping', 'God', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'put', 'act', 'are', 'real', 'deal', 'favorite', 'songs', 'DVD', 'are', 'quot', 'Took', 'My', 'Place', 'quot', 'good', 'song', 'get', 'crowd', 'moving', 'excited', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'Always', 'Loved', 'quot', '-A', 'song', 'even', 'may', 'stumble', 'fall', 'God', 'still', 'always', 'will', 'quot', 'Hope', 'quot', '-The', 'testimony', 'Mac', 'Powell', 'song', 'will', 'want', 'make', 'shout', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'GO', 'BUY', 'IT', 'NOW']",N/A
