In the original ""Iron Chef"" two chefs - usually Japanese - would compete using the main ingredient specified by the eccentric gourmet authority Chairman Kaga. Kaga was a warlord-like character that had specially constructed a cooking arena called ""Kitchen Stadium"" in his castle where visiting chefs would compete against his Gourmet Academy, led by his several master Iron Chefs. Chairman Kaga himself was a showpiece in flamboyant, heavily decorated coats and jackets. The show had a campy charm that evoked memories of the English-dubbed kung fu movies of the 1970s.Iron Chef USA is entirely too....American. In typical us-versus-them fashion (Note- everyone who is not ""me"" is ""them"") competitors will stoop to anything. The judges seem more like competitors in ""The Hollywood Squares"" game show of yesteryear than the dignified characters of the original Iron Chef. The Japanese judges would do anything to keep the competitors from losing face in the original, and it was quite comical to see them wrinkle up their faces and try to find something to complement about dishes they obviously found hard to swallow. Making fun of the dishes seems to be the point for the judges in the U.S. version.In short, skip this entry and hold out for the original ""Iron Chef"" to come out on DVD some day. It was truly a unique and fun show.",2,Iron Chef USA is entirely too ...

706754,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,B0000694ZH,Carl Malmstrom,"[12, 13]","Given the explosion of TV titles now being released on DVD, I find it somewhat baffling that &quot;Iron Chef USA&quot; has made it out on DVD before its Japanese predecessor.  Originally intended as a semi-regular series of specials on UPN, it was put out of its misery after only two episodes.The Iron Chef phenomenon is definitely missing something in its translation to American programming - which is, perhaps, confusing given the faithfulness of its adaptation to the Japanese original.  Virtually every aspect of the show - from the melodramatic Chairman (no longer named 'Kaga', but now played by William Shatner) to the theme music has been brought over.  However, in casting the show, they seem to have found people with no prior knowledge of it.  It's as if the producers were fans of the show down to smallest detail, but somehow could only recruit people who had no prior acquaintance to it.  The judges and the commentators seem to be especially guilty of this.  Rather than commenting on styles of cooking or familiarizing themselves with intricacies of ingredients, they fall back on statements like &quot;For those of you who don't know what ravioli is...&quot;.  Likewise, the judges seem more concerned with how the food stacks up to popular cuisine than how innovative it is.  It all makes for a show that seems to be trying too self-consciously to be campy.The DVD itself is even a bit of a disappointment.  It contains both episodes shown, but falls totally flat on extras.  There's nothing to bring the novice up to speed with the &quot;Iron Chef&quot; phenomenon, no deleted scenes, commentary or anything else - just a subtitle track and previews for a few other &quot;Lion's Gate&quot; titles (including the preview for this very DVD).So, unless you have a perverse fascination for William Shatner or a bizarre desire to own failed UPN programming in perpetutity, I recommend giving this a miss.  It's not the worst thing ever put to DVD, but it's really not suitable for watching anytime before 2am.

I don't tape all the episodes to keep, but I certainly make an effor to tape them if I have to be out when it's on.  Because I am such a fan of it, when I saw this advertised on UPN, I watched it, knowing it has Shatner in the role of the chairman.  I'm also a trekkie, so I didn't exactly expect anything less than camp, glitz, and ham when you put Shatner and IC together.  With the right kind of attitude, I rather enjoyed the show.  I thought Kerry Simon needed a haircut though!  But don't underestimate the culinary skills of these chefs.  They definitely take their cooking seriously.For that matter, the chefs on the Japanese version took their cooking very seriously too.  I mean, c'mon, a feud between Kandagawa and the Japanese Iron  Chefs?  Just relax and enjoy the show, and maybe somewhere in there you'll also learn a thing or two that you can actually do to your food in your own kitchen, instead of the rarefied atmosphere of Kitchen Stadium.But this one is something I'd not bother buying.  If you can tape it off TV, however, it's fun enough to watch.  But not really worth the money on the DVD, especially, as people have said, there aren't even extras to justify it.

706757,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0000694ZH,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[66, 67]","Between 1993 and 1999, a popular television show in Japan called ""Iron Chef"" (""Ryori no tetsujin"") pitted its acclaimed one of its professional chefs against a challenging chef each week using a particular theme ingredient in all of the dishes made.  The show was hosted by the flamboyant Chairman Kaga (Takeshi Kaga) who opened each show, presented the challenger, unveiled the theme ingredient and gave a brief synopsis before the winning chef was declared. The show gained popularity in syndication in the U.S. on the Food Network using a mixture of dubbed English and subtitles.Due to the rising popularity of the show from cable subscribers, the UPN TV network decided to broadcast an American version of the show in 2001 that was produced by the Larry Thompson Organization and Lions Gate Television of Canada.  Unfortunately, these two companies failed to effectively reproduce the elements of the Japanese show that had made it so popular.  Instead, they created a poorly written & directed substitute that was akin to watching a WWF wrestling match, not a challenge between two professional chefs.The first mistake that the Larry Thompson Organization and Lions Gate Television made was in their selection of the new chairman for ""Iron Chef USA"".  Though I very much enjoy William Shatner in his roles as Captain Kirk in the original ""Star Trek"" TV series, T.J. Hooker in the show of the same name and his more recent role as an attorney in ""Boston Legal"", his attempt at being chairman of ""Iron Chef USA"" was far too farcical and clownish to be taken seriously in trying to replicate Takeshi Kaga's flamboyance from the original Japanese TV series.  Their next mistake was in the commentaries.  During each of the original Japanese ""Iron Chef"" shows, a group of commentators (which included a culinary expert) would explain what each chef was doing, as well as analyze the possible dish outcomes.  The ""Iron Chef USA"" commentators treated the two chefs as if they were athletes and would even send in an annoying ""field reporter"" (Sissy Biggers) to ask them stupid question while they were busily preparing their meals.  Their other major mistake was their selection of judges.  Most of the Japanese ""Iron Chef"" shows included an actual food critic as one of the judges, as well as Japanese actors, actresses & sports personalities, who were quite articulate in their critiques of the prepared meals; but the ""Iron Chef USA"" judges were inarticulate and inexperienced.Not surprisingly (and quite thankfully), only two episodes of ""Iron Chef USA"" starring William Shatner were ever produced and were entitled, ""Iron Chef USA: Showdown in Las Vegas"" and ""Iron Chef USA: Holiday Showdown"".  Each of these shows on the DVD I rate with a well-deserved 1 out of 5 stars for being poor mockeries of the much more entertaining original Japanese version.  In 2004, the Food Network's produced its own version entitled ""Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters"" that included two of the beloved original Japanese Iron Chefs, Hiroyuki Sakai and Masaharu Morimoto, and was hosted by Takeshi Kaga's nephew, Mark Dacascos.  It was a far better show than the ill-fated 2001 ""Iron Chef USA"".  If you are considering purchase of the 2001 ""Iron Chef USA"" DVD, you do so at your own risk.",1,Chairman William Shatner?
