Whereas Seasons 1 & 2 (and parts of 3) were very amusing, Season 4 isn't funny at all.  None of the character developments or jokes are funny in the least.  All jokes fall flat, and what little potential some developments had are squandered after they're repeated the umpteenth time (Grizzlebees, anyone?).  Whereas the first 2 seasons actually were intelligently quirky, Season 4 needs a lobotomy to enjoy.

I was pleasantly surprised with an awesome season. Sealab went out with a bang . Captain Shanks really came to shine in this season and became just as great a character as any other. Many shows try and fail at outrageous over the top cartoon comedy but sealab is among the few who do it so well it makes it look easy.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[8, 10]","Many fans of Adult Swim's underrated Sealab 2021 will say that the show declined in quality after fan favorite Harry Goz (voice of Captain Murphy) died, and they'd be mostly right.  Throughout many of the episodes found here in the fourth season of Sealab 2021, many episodes are hit and miss.  Case in point is when the crew visits an island filled with Chupacabras, as well as ""Joy of Grief"" featuring a homicidal grief counselor picking off the crew one by one.  However, there are some bright shining moments which are hilarious, including the return of Marco (Erik Estrada), as well as ""Casinko"" where Sealab is turned into a Native American casino, ""Shrabster"" which tells a deliciously funny tale in reverse, and the final episode, ""Legacy of Laughter"".  This episode sums up the whole series (and even throws in some great in-jokes), and is a bittersweet end for an underrated series.  All in all, the fourth season of Sealab 2021 is certainly not the best season in the series, but you could do far, far worse.",4,The end,1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,1019,"['Many', 'fans', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'underrated', 'Sealab', '2021', 'will', 'say', 'show', 'declined', 'quality', 'fan', 'favorite', 'Harry', 'Goz', 'voice', 'Captain', 'Murphy', 'died', ""'d"", 'be', 'mostly', 'right', 'many', 'episodes', 'found', 'here', 'fourth', 'season', 'Sealab', '2021', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'Case', 'point', 'when', 'crew', 'island', 'filled', 'Chupacabras', 'as', 'well', 'Joy', 'Grief', 'featuring', 'homicidal', 'grief', 'counselor', 'picking', 'off', 'crew', 'one', 'one', 'However', 'are', 'bright', 'shining', 'moments', 'are', 'hilarious', 'including', 'return', 'Marco', 'Erik', 'Estrada', 'as', 'well', 'Casinko', 'where', 'Sealab', 'turned', 'Native', 'American', 'casino', 'Shrabster', 'deliciously', 'funny', 'tale', 'reverse', 'final', 'episode', 'Legacy', 'Laughter', 'episode', 'up', 'whole', 'series', 'even', 'throws', 'great', 'in-jokes', 'bittersweet', 'end', 'underrated', 'series', 'fourth', 'season', 'Sealab', '2021', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'series', 'could', 'do', 'far', 'far', 'worse']",N/A

992906,A3AEGF8VXI8PAX,B000FO0AG0,"Thursday Next ""Daria""","[0, 1]","I found this show because my husband had watched it years ago on Adult Swim on the Cartoon Network and requested it for a Christmas present. When we got the series (I bought all 4 seasons for him), we started to watch them together. At first, I thought, ""What... the... hell??"" But after repeated viewings, the show grew on me and now I LOVE it.The show is based on a serious cartoon from the 70's (I think) called, Sealab 2020, and uses the original animation from that show. The comedy here is more absurdist and non sequitur. A lot of times, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of continuity, and the characters repeatedly die as part of the joke, but return in the next episode unharmed.Captain Murphy was one of my favorite characters, and I was sad to find out that the reason Captain Murphy disappeared in season 4 was because the voice actor, Harry Goz, had died. He was replaced on the show by his son, Michael Goz, who voiced Captain Tornado Shanks. The series as a whole gets 5 stars from me, but this season in particular only got 4 stars because Captain Shanks was nothing compared to Captain Murphy.The show is very well-written with a lot of memorable moments and lines. I would share some of my favorite lines, but most make little to no sense out of context. The only one I will give you (because it appears often and for seemingly no reason) is this:""Pod six is jerks.""This show is definitely NOT for children (at least none that I know), but it is VERY funny. Since this show is not on the air anymore, if you like it and want something similar, try Archer on FX. It is currently on hiatus, but can be found on Netflix.

Some episodes are forgettable but, the last episode, Legacy of Laughter, is one of my favorites.  THe extras are a little lacking.  There are no commentaries.  They have some pretty good deleted scenes, ""nighshift"" which is odd but, pretty funny, and ""best of Sealab"" which has the trees (if you've seen ""isla de chupacabra"", you'd know)showing clips of the best moments.
