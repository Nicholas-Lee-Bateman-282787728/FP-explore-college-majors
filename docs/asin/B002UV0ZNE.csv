1290773,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002UV0ZNE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Sporting wise, the nation of India has always held cricket close to its heart, more so than football or field hockey or anything else.Lagaan - Once Upon a Time in Indiais probably the best and most well known film about cricket ever made in Indian cinema. AndIqbalis pretty terrific, as well. DIL BOLE HADIPPA! is the most recent cricket film but it takes a more lighthearted approach and mixes in madcap elements of romance and assumed identity. The two leads, Shahid Kapoor and Rani Mukherjee and their terrific chemistry, make it a fun Bollywood flick.Veera Kaur dreams of being a world class cricket batsman, except that she's this tiny slip of a Punjabi girl and, really, what Indian cricket team worth its salt is going to give her a whiff? But she's a big dreamer and enthusiastic and optimistic and, in the meantime, she performs on stage with the local theater group, the Best Friend Dance Company.Rohan is an accomplished cricket player residing in England. He flies back home to the Indian border town of Amritsar when he gets word that his father has had a heart attack, except that his father merely wanted to lure him back home so that he could captain the Indian Tigers, a pathetic bunch of cricket players which year after year had lost its matches against the powerful Pakistani team. It's not a rivalry if only one team keeps winning.Rohan agrees to stay and be captain and he sets about getting his slovenly players in shape. It's a huge challenge and it doesn't help that a newcomer threatens to become a distraction. Veer Pratap Singh arrived out of nowhere and demonstrated real promise. But there's something really strange about him.I think I realized I was in good hands when, early on, there was a brief nod to Aishwarya Rai's musical number ""Kajra Re"" fromBunty Aur Babli, a film which also featured Rani Mukherjee (or Mukerji, whichever). There's another reference to DILWALE DULHANIA LE JAYENGE, but that just feels like Yash Raj Films trying to live off its past glory. Indian cinema wears its heart on its sleeve, and the films coming out of the industry tend to be unabashedly sentimental and exuberant and very colorful. If you're into cricket, there's enough attention paid to the sport that it doesn't feel like a subordinate plot device. Rani took it upon herself to get in superb shape and got together with a cricket coach to make sure that she looked as convincing as possible, athletically.There's a bit of TWELFTH NIGHT in this flick, or to go with the more recent incarnation, there's quite a bit ofShe's the Man (Widescreen Edition)in this flick. Veera Kaur loves cricket so much and regards her skills so highly that she's willing to do anything to play in the men's team, even disguise herself as a man. This naturally leads to all sorts of complications, on and off the field. Veer also finds himself the Captain's confidant, what with Rohan interested in his ""sister"" Veera.""Hadippa!"" is an expression of exuberance - I guess kind of like ""Hurrah!"" Appropriately, there's an infectious tone running throughout the movie. And, yes, it's predictable and absurd and there's an amount of silly here, but it doesn't go so overboard that it becomes grating. Shahid Kapoor, as buff an actor as you'll see today, is a pretty good actor and he adds depth to his character, balancing Rohan's focused, no-nonsense demeanor with the suddenly smitten side. Rani is Rani, an accomplished actress and while her ""Veer"" isn't really that convincing - Veer is actually pretty effeminate - she is the film's driving force. Playing Veera, the outspoken Punjabi girl, she has never looked lovelier. Her scenes with Shahid are terrific. Rani's moments with Shahid when she's playing Veer actually seem to be even more interesting than when she's hanging out with Shahid as Veera. Rohan and Veera follow that same old romantic template and that's nice enough, but Veer is such a weird and boisterous character. It's fascinating to see Rani gleefully fleshing him out, even if she makes no effort to disguise her distinctive throaty voice.There's the expected sappy speech at the end, of course. And, before that, the big cricket match which plays out excitingly. There's the supermodel vying for Rohan's attention but she doesn't prove to be that big of an impediment. There's Rohan gradually coming to appreciate his homeland, seeing it thru the glowing eyes of the down-to-earth Punjabi girl. And, being Bollywood, there are vibrant colors and all the music and all the dancing. There are three highlight numbers for me. ""Discowale Khisko"" is an enthusiastic outdoor celebration backboned by that catchy Punjabi beat, a musical explosion of vivid colors, intricate choreography, and a villageful of dancers. ""Ishq Hi Hai Rab"" is more laid back and reflective, this song chronicling Veera and Rohan's exploration of the countryside and its people. ""Hadipppa the Remix"" is heard during the end credits segment, and this is probably the best and most smoove I've ever seen Rani dance. Regarding Shahid, dude always could bust a move.This one comes with two discs. Disc 1 has the feature presentation. Disc 2 has the following bonus features: The Making Of DIL BOLE HADIPPA!; The Making Of the songs ""Discowale Khisko"" & ""Hadipppa the Remix""; ""Hadippa the Remix"" video; nine deleted scenes, no English sub-titles; the theatrical trailer & various film promos; DIL BOLE HADIPPA at the Toronto International Film Festival - this is basically Rani doing the red carpet thing and signing autographs and taking photos with the appreciative fans; and a photo gallery.",4,a world class batsman in a girl's body,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,5583,"['Sporting', 'wise', 'nation', 'India', 'always',

1290774,A9T0DBHRUV2N7,B002UV0ZNE,Lee Jilek,"[1, 2]","I realized right off the bat that if I stopped questioning if Rani is believable as a man or not, the movie would be a lot more fun.  Knowing nothing about Cricket, I thought she was believable as a batsman but it seems like maybe size and strength would matter more than it does in the Cricket scenes. I really enjoyed the Cricket scenes and believe that Baseball could learn a lot from Cricket on how to make Baseball less boring. Would like to see a real Cricket match someday.There is some goofiness in this film that is no harder to watch than the goofiness in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham,  Kuch Kuch Hota Hai or DDLJ.  I did like Rani in the back-of-the-truck scene where she speaks with poor English, chews on sugar cane and spits out chewed cane sometimes toward Shahid in defiance of his self-proclaimed Indianness. Seems like there is a new side to her acting in every film.There are some scenes where Shahid is intense and very very good and some scenes where he doesn't seem to feel what he is doing, but it doesn't hurt the film much.Okay, the main reason I buy Indian films is for the music and dancing and Dil Bole Hadippa does not disappoint on that count. There are 3 big dance songs and my favorite (by a little) is the big carnival dance, Discowale Khisko.  Some of the wording and movement in that dance set up an outrageously funny collision between Sherlyn Chopra and Rakhi Sawant. There is a fairly loud ringing-ching from jewelry and bangles due to the collision - wonderful humor in acknowledgement of how much jewelry these women sometimes wear.  Rani, Shahid and backup dancers really get with it in these drum driven dances.Bottom line: story 4 - 5 because of the moral, Cricket scenes 4 - 5 because I've never seen it before, acting 3 - 5 because it's all over the place (blame the director) and music and dancing a solid 5.  So I guess a strong 4 overall but a 5 if you are into Indian songs, drums and dancing.",5,Suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride!,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,1938,"['realized', 'right', 'bat', 'stopped', 'questioning', 'Rani', 'believable', 'man', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'Knowing', 'nothing', 'Cricket', 'thought', 'was', 'believable', 'batsman', 'maybe', 'size', 'strength', 'would', 'matter', 'more', 'Cricket', 'scenes', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Cricket', 'scenes', 'believe', 'Baseball', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'Cricket', 'how', 'make', 'Baseball', 'less', 'boring', 'Would', 'like', 'see', 'real', 'Cricket', 'match', 'someday.There', 'goofiness', 'film', 'harder', 'watch', 'goofiness', 'Kabhi', 'Khushi', 'Kabhie', 'Gham', 'Kuch', 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai', 'DDLJ', 'did', 'like', 'Rani', 'back-of-the-truck', 'scene', 'where', 'poor', 'English', 'sugar', 'cane', 'out', 'chewed', 'cane', 'sometimes', 'Shahid', 'defiance', 'self-proclaimed', 'Indianness', 'new', 'side', 'acting', 'film.There', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'Shahid', 'intense', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'where', ""n't"", 'seem', 'feel', 'what', 'doing', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'film', 'much.Okay', 'main', 'reason', 'buy', 'Indian', 'films', 'music', 'dancing', 'Dil', 'Bole', 'Hadippa', 'not', 'disappoint', 'count', 'are', '3', 'big', 'dance', 'songs', 'favorite', 'little', 'big', 'carnival', 'dance', 'Discowale', 'Khisko', 'wording', 'movement', 'dance', 'set', 'up', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'collision', 'Sherlyn', 'Chopra', 'Rakhi', 'Sawant', 'fairly', 'loud', 'ringing-ching', 'jewelry', 'bangles', 'due', 'collision', 'wonderful', 'humor', 'acknowledgement', 'how', 'much', 'jewelry', 'women', 'sometimes', 'wear', 'Rani', 'Shahid', 'backup', 'dancers', 'really', 'get', 'drum', 'driven', 'dances.Bottom', 'line', 'story', '4', '5', 'moral', 'Cricket', '4', '5', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'acting', '3', '5', 'place', 'blame', 'director', 'music', 'dancing', 'solid', '5', 'So', 'guess', 'strong', '4', 'overall', '5', 'are', 'Indian', 'songs', 'drums', 'dancing']",N/A

Predictable, yes. A little parochial, yes. But full of life, well acted, well directed, and with one of the best soundtracks I've heard on a Hindi film. Rani Mukherjee blew me away as Veer/Veera - I had no idea she had such excellent comedy chops. Shahid Kapoor is at his best in many ways - he gets to show some range (including a touch of the dark side he showed in Fida). Most importantly he has shed that ridiculous SRK haircut he has had in past movies. And he is simply mesmerising to watch when he dances.Mika Singh & Co. pulled out all the stops for a great soundtrack for this movie too - 'Discowale Khisco', 'Hadippa!', 'Bhangra Bistar', are all great beat-driven tunes.My only minor complaint is the movie falls into the old 'Punjab is the best' rut which probably started with Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.",5,"Fun, Bright, Funny",1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,1215,"['remake', 'Man', 'one', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'executed', 'so', 'well.In', 'order', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'playing', 'cricket', 'India', ""'carnival"", 'dancer', 'talented', 'cricketer', 'Veera', 'Mukherjee', 'male', 'alter', 'ego', 'Veer', 'course', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'pretense', 'when', 'captain', 'team', 'Rohan', 'Kapoor', '.This', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Predictable', 'yes', 'little', 'parochial', 'yes', 'full', 'life', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'directed', 'one', 'best', 'soundtracks', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Hindi', 'film', 'Rani', 'Mukherjee', 'blew', 'away', 'Veer/Veera', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'such', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'chops', 'Shahid', 'Kapoor', 'best', 'many', 'ways', 'show', 'range', 'including', 'touch', 'dark', 'side', 'showed', 'Fida', 'Most', 'importantly', 'shed', 'ridiculous', 'SRK', 'haircut', 'had', 'past', 'movies', 'simply', 'mesmerising', 'watch', 'when', 'Singh', 'Co.', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'too', ""'Discowale"", 'Khisco', 'Bistar', 'are', 'great', 'beat-driven', 'tunes.My', 'only', 'minor', 'complaint', 'movie', 'old', ""'Punjab"", 'best', 'rut', 'probably', 'started', 'Dilwale', 'Dulhania', 'Le', 'Jayenge']",N/A

Also reminds of 2006 american film 'She's the man' with Amanda Bines, all of them are romantic comedies where the lady is not any lady in distress but a guy looking for his/her place in the guys team (in this film is a cricket team), but he/she will find certain circumstances in the way.It's always fun to find this kind of movie, and how they finally portrait it, specially at the end of the story (because it is never the same).

1290780,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002UV0ZNE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Dil Bole Hadippa! (Anurag Singh, 2009)I admit it&#8212;I'm a sucker for big Bollywood productions. (Which is odd considering how much I despise most American musicals.) I'm also a very big fan of cricket and I have generally been impressed with many of the &#8220;updated Shakespeare&#8221; attempts that have come across my screen (viz. recent Coriolanus review). So what we have here is a Bollywood movie about cricket that's based loosely on Twelfth Night... it's like someone went fishing in my brain and came up with the perfect combination of stuff. Which is not to say Dil Bole Hadippa! Is the best movie in the world or anything, but for what it is, it's a barrel of fun.Plot: Veera Kaur (Veer-Zaara's Rani Mukerji) is a cricket-obsessed young woman who's sick of watching her small border town's circket squad lose to the squad of their Pakistani neighbors every year. After their eighteenth loss in a row, she goes to join up and is turned away for being a woman. Problem? Not in Bollywood, where a glamorous young lady can smack on a mustache, don a turban, and become Veer Pratap Singh, who suddenly appears out of nowhere in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, and no one questions this! (Just run with it...) Meanwhile, Vicky Singh (Bend It Like Beckham's Anupam Kehr), the squad's owner has a son, Rohan Singh (Chance Pe Dance's Shahid Kapoor), who's gone off to become an international cricket star; Vicky convinces Rohan to come back and train the squad in preparation for next year's match. So they have a trainer who knows the goods and a mysterious new star, and everything's great... until Rohan starts falling for Veera. Cue comedy of errors.There is nothing here you haven't seen before, but Singh, an associate director since the mid-nineties stepping into the big chair (this is his second film as a director), has learned his craft well; it's an engaging little movie with likable characters stuck into dumb, but funny, situations. Yes, you've got to suspend a whole lot of disbelief to get it to work, but it's a Bollywood movie&#8212;if you're not already suspending disbelief when an entire town suddenly breaks into a choreographed dance routine, you're probably watching the wrong genre. There's a fun script, a decent-if-not-yet-great director, and top-notch stars. There's singing, there's dancing, there's romance, and above all there's cricket. What more could you want? *** ",4,In the Crease.,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,2423,"['Dil', 'Bole', 'Hadippa', 'Anurag', 'Singh', '2009', 'admit', '8212', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'big', 'Bollywood', 'productions', 'Which', 'odd', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'despise', 'most', 'American', 'musicals', ""'m"", 'also', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'cricket', 'have', 'generally', 'been', 'impressed', 'many', '8220', 'updated', 'Shakespeare', '8221', 'attempts', 'have', 'come', 'screen', 'viz', 'recent', 'Coriolanus', 'review', 'So', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'cricket', 'based', 'loosely', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'someone', 'went', 'fishing', 'brain', 'came', 'up', 'perfect', 'combination', 'stuff', 'Which', 'not', 'say', 'Dil', 'Bole', 'Hadippa', 'best', 'movie', 'world', 'anything', 'what', 'barrel', 'fun.Plot', 'Veera', 'Kaur', 'Veer-Zaara', 'Rani', 'Mukerji', 'cricket-obsessed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'sick', 'watching', 'small', 'border', 'town', 'circket', 'squad', 'lose', 'squad', 'Pakistani', 'neighbors', 'year', 'eighteenth', 'loss', 'row', 'join', 'up', 'turned', 'away', 'being', 'woman', 'Problem', 'Not', 'Bollywood', 'where', 'glamorous', 'young', 'lady', 'can', 'smack', 'mustache', 'don', 'turban', 'become', 'Veer', 'Pratap', 'Singh', 'who', 'suddenly', 'nowhere', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'else', 'one', 'questions', 'Just', 'run', 'Meanwhile', 'Vicky', 'Singh', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'Anupam', 'Kehr', 'squad', 'owner', 'son', 'Rohan', 'Singh', 'Chance', 'Pe', 'Dance', 'Shahid', 'Kapoor', 'who', 'gone', 'off', 'become', 'international', 'cricket', 'star', 'Vicky', 'convinces', 'Rohan', 'come', 'back', 'train', 'squad', 'preparation', 'next', 'year', 'match', 'have', 'trainer', 'who', 'goods', 'mysterious', 'new', 'star', 'everything', 'great', 'Rohan', 'falling', 'Veera', 'Cue', 'comedy', 'errors.There', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Singh', 'associate', 'director', 'mid-nineties', 'stepping', 'big', 'chair', 'second', 'film', 'director', 'learned', 'craft', 'well', 'engaging', 'little', 'movie', 'likable', 'characters', 'stuck', 'dumb', 'funny', 'situations', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'got', 'suspend', 'whole', 'lot', 'disbelief', 'get', 'work', 'Bollywood', 'movie', '8212', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'when', 'entire', 'town', 'suddenly', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'routine', ""'re"", 'probably', 'watching', 'wrong', 'genre', 'fun', 'script', 'decent-if-not-yet-great', 'director', 'top-notch', 'stars', 'singing', 'dancing', 'romance', 'cricket', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'want', '***']",N/A
