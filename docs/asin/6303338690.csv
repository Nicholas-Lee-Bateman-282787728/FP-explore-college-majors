369982,A2582KMXLK2P06,6303338690,B. E Jackson,"[2, 3]","I really liked this film.  It's not a groundbreaking movie in any way, though.  It's about a bunch of underdog kids who aren't interested in football until a coach comes along and changes their minds.  Throughout the movie we see the kids working out and trying hard to prepare for the match against the other more talented (and unlikeable) team.  It's pretty much the same thing we've seen in the Mighty Ducks except now it's about football.It's just a typical family movie that sends the message to children that even if you're small and think you don't have any talent, you actually DO have the talent to play football, hockey, basketball, whatever.  One of the characters is a girl who doesn't know if she wants to play football with the boys or be a cheerleader like all the other girls.Rick Moranis once again plays that shy, quiet character he does so well in other films such as Honey I Shrunk the Kids.  It's hard to believe he's now a country singer (no, I'm not kidding).  Ed O'Neil doesn't quite play the jerk character you'd expect from the Married with Children show.  He's not really a nice guy either, though.I find it interesting that the team names are the Giants (the good guys) vs. the Cowboys (the bad guys) because the Monday Night Football game this week were those two teams facing each other (with the Giants winning).",5,solid acting and excellent story,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,1343,"['really', 'liked', 'film', 'not', 'groundbreaking', 'movie', 'way', 'though', 'bunch', 'underdog', 'kids', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'football', 'coach', 'along', 'changes', 'minds', 'movie', 'see', 'kids', 'working', 'out', 'trying', 'hard', 'prepare', 'match', 'other', 'more', 'talented', 'unlikeable', 'team', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mighty', 'Ducks', 'now', 'football.It', 'just', 'typical', 'family', 'movie', 'message', 'children', 'even', ""'re"", 'small', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'talent', 'actually', 'DO', 'have', 'talent', 'play', 'football', 'hockey', 'basketball', 'One', 'characters', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'play', 'football', 'boys', 'be', 'cheerleader', 'other', 'girls.Rick', 'Moranis', 'once', 'again', 'shy', 'quiet', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Honey', 'Shrunk', 'Kids', 'hard', 'believe', 'now', 'country', 'singer', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'Ed', ""O'Neil"", ""n't"", 'quite', 'play', 'jerk', 'character', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Married', 'Children', 'show', 'not', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'though.I', 'find', 'interesting', 'team', 'names', 'are', 'Giants', 'good', 'guys', 'vs.', 'Cowboys', 'bad', 'guys', 'Monday', 'Night', 'Football', 'game', 'week', 'were', 'two', 'teams', 'facing', 'other', 'Giants', 'winning']",Little Giants VHS

369993,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,6303338690,L.A. Scene,"[3, 8]","When Ed O'Neill was cast into the role as Al Bundy in the late 1980s comedy, ""Married with Children"", it quickly would become a role synonymous with O'Neill himself.  At the same time it catapulted O'Neill into a major star.  It seemed natural that O'Neill would soon start to do feature films.  However, for the most part O'Neill's feature film resume has never lived up to his role as Al Bundy.  In 1994, while still on ""Married with Children"", O'Neill would team up with Rick Moranis to star in a comedy called ""Little Giants"".  While I'd hardly call ""Little Giants"" a groundbreaking or award-winning movie, it still was a pretty good film.  Much of what made this movie very good has to be credited to the talents of O'Neill himself.For the most part, ""Little Giants"" follows a familiar style of story.  O'Neill plays Kevin O'Shea.  Kevin is a local hometown former All-American football hero.  Kevin is now retired from Football and owns a successful car dealership in his hometown of Urbania.  He lives in an nice house with his wife and two daughters.  Also living in Urbania is Kevin's brother Danny O'Shea (played by Rick Moranis).  Danny's life hasn't been quite as successful.  Danny's wife had abandoned him and his daughter Becky many years ago - living Danny in the role as single parent.  Danny runs a service station in Urbania, but doesn't nearly live the lifestyle of Kevin.  When Kevin is asked to coach a peewee football team to represent Urbania, he takes the role very competitively as he has taken Football all of his life.  When Danny sees Kevin having tryouts for the Football team, he becomes very upset with the way Kevin is handling things.  Kevin only picks the best players to play.  While Danny's daughter Becky deserves to play, Kevin basically leaves her off the team because he is a girl  Not only does Danny feel Becky deserves to play, but he feels that all kids deserve a chance to play on Urbania's peewee football team - no matter how good they are.  This leads Danny to form his own football team - with the ""castoffs and misfits"" who didn't make Kevin's team.  Because the peewee football league will only allow one team to represent Urbania, Kevin and Danny have their teams square off on the field to decide who will represent Urbania.  The film then focuses on Danny's attempts to build and train a rag-tagged Football team up against his brother's well-oiled machine.There are a couple of interesting subplots going on in this film.  The first one involves Becky - Danny's daughter.  We see Becky struggle with walking a fine-line between being a tom-boy and a teenage girl.  Since Becky is a main part of Danny's team, this has an integral role in the film.  The other involves Danny and Kevin's attempt to recruit a blue chip prospect named ""Spike"" - a new boy in town, with a ""little league father"".The movie also uses the NFL connection in a couple of ways.  The first is the team names.  Kevin's team adopts the helmets and uniforms of the Dallas Cowboys while Danny's team will adopt the helmets of the New York Giants.  Being a New York Giants fan, it made me even root more for the underdog ""Little"" New York Giants against the hated Dallas Cowboys (On the other hand, Cowboy fans may not feel the same way).  The other involves some cameos of some famous NFL stars.  These NFL stars happen to be passing through Urbania and lend a hand to Danny as he is training the Little Giants for the big game.  These players include Tim Brown, Steve Emtman, Bruce Smith, Emmitt Smith, and of course John Madden - all of whom are playing themselves.  As he does in the broadcast booth, Madden will also entertain on the big screen.In this movie, Rick Moranis is once again cast into the wimpy, unsuccessful character.  We see this happen in a movie he does later on with Tom Arnold called ""Big Bully"".  This is a style of character that has almost become synonymous with Moranis himself.  While Moranis' character of Danny is the hero - he becomes a difficult character to root for.  It's O'Neill's character of Kevin that dominates.  This is not because Kevin is ""stronger"" than Danny - it is because that Ed O'Neill is a superior actor to Rick Moranis.  The only interesting thing that happens to the character of Danny O'Shea is how the idea of coaching up against his brother begins to consume him - and impact his relationship with daughter Becky.The idea of an underdog team going up against the established team is something we've seen time and time again.  The other concept of the weaker brother going up against the stronger brother is also something that has been seen many times.  While ""Little Giants"" will entertain audiences throughout the movie, the familiar concepts of underdog and brother against brother are completely predictable.  On top of that, the ending will also be completely predictable - including how most of the big game between the Giants and Cowboys go.  On a side note, the kids playing the members of the Little Giants team are very fun to watch.Still despite the predictability, I still found this a pretty decent movie.  Even with the movie being very predictable, the nice thing is that the underdog Giants will become a very root-able team against the Cowboys.  And of course, Ed O'Neill will shine big time in this movie.  This is a good movie for young and old to watch and one that I would recommend.",3,Predictable - ultimately this is Ed O'Neill's film,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,5385,"['When', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"",

It has a rare charm all it's own, with lessons on life, team spirit, friendship, and yes,  a girl can play football, too.A sweetly humorous movie in which childhood innocence shines through for all to see and from an underdog's vantage point, cowering behind the bleachers.Predictable but who would want it any other way?.Quote from the film:Coach O'Shea: What the hell's that?Butz: Cheetos.Coach O'Shea: Crunchy or puffed?Butz: Puffed.Coach O'Shea: [under his breath] Wimp.",5,Fabulous family film,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,873,"['Little', 'Giants', '1994', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Shawna', 'Waldron', 'Devon', 'SawaOne', 'better', 'family', 'comedy', 'sports.A', 'sad', 'sack', 'team', 'misfit', 'kids', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'picked', 'anything', 'get', 'chance', 'play', 'competitive', 'peewee', 'football', 'small', 'town', 'coached', 'Moranis', 'hopeless', 'misfit', 'himself.This', 'movie', 'destined', 'be', 'classic', 'kids', 'will', 'certainly', 'love', 'adults', 'rare', 'charm', 'own', 'lessons', 'life', 'team', 'spirit', 'friendship', 'yes', 'girl', 'can', 'play', 'football', 'too.A', 'sweetly', 'humorous', 'movie', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'shines', 'see', 'underdog', 'vantage', 'point', 'cowering', 'bleachers.Predictable', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'other', 'way', '.Quote', 'film', 'Coach', ""O'Shea"", 'What', 'hell', 'Butz', 'Cheetos.Coach', ""O'Shea"", 'Crunchy', 'puffed', 'Butz', 'Puffed.Coach', ""O'Shea"", '[', 'breath', ']', 'Wimp']",Little Giants VHS

It's a wonderful movie with a lot of great jokes and physcial humour. Kind of like Mighty Ducks, but in my opinion, a lot better with greatly funnier jokes. The only thing keeping me from giving this a full five stars, and a lot of you will think it's a stupid reason....as do I, but on the original VHS version, there was a Michigan J. Frog cartoon short before the movie. This is absent on the dvd version. That said, the dvd is a lot better for many other reasons. There are really cool bios about the people who helped invent football, a theatrical trailer for the movie, a really awesome special introduction by Shawna Waldron, who played Becky The Icebox in the movie (man, she got really hot) and a really fun commentary by the director, one of the writers, and Shawna Waldron.

We saw the same plot used in each Mighty Duck picture, Big Green, Ladybugs, and now little Giants.  It's all basically a re-hash of 1970's hit The Bad News Bears.  Only difference is that the Bears ultimately lost their big game but today we need happy endings.In this version, Rick Moranis is Danny O' Shea a nerdy guy and brother to Kevin O'Shea (ed O'Neil) who was the town's star athlete 20 years earlier.  kevin now coaches the towns little league football team and Danny's Dauther is cut from the team, Danny outs together his own team of misfits to compete in a winner take all battle.All the usual characters are here...the Tomboy who is Danny's Daughter Becky, the fat kid, the nerdy kid, the verious ethnic kids, and the good kid who doesn't want to play with the other team, are all well-represented.Danny doesn't know the first thing about football and struggles early until a bus breaks down in town that just happens to be carrying John Madden along with NFL stars Bruce Smith, Emmitt Smith, and Tim Brown.  The stars pass along their wisdom to help Danny out.Of course, things still don't go well and the team is losing badly, but when Becky drops her cheerleader pompoms and joins the team at halftime, things turn around for the Little Giants.It's all sappy and formulatic...you've seen it before but its not a horrible movie.
