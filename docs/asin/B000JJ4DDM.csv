1026504,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000JJ4DDM,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[10, 10]","A few years back, Ricky Gervais created ""The Office,"" a Dilberty satire on office work. Now, he's created ""Extras,"" a wickedly funny satire on showbiz and acting. And the fact that prominent actors appear in it -- as warped versions of themselves -- is just the icing on the comedy cake.Andy Millman (Gervais) and Maggie Jacobs (Ashley Jenson) are film extras -- Andy is embittered by his lack of success and his inept agent (Stephen Merchant, Gervais' work partner), while well-meaning Maggie merely pursues a series of crew members on the films they work in.The first episode features the two working in a biopic directed by a brusque Ben Stiller (""Would you stop going on about your f**king dead wife?""), and Andy gets himself kicked off the set. Subsequently, he ends up in the middle of a feud between UK footballer-turned-actor and Eastenders star Vinnie Jones and Ross Kemp.In the following episodes, Andy and Maggie blunder around with various stars: Kate Winslet in a nun costume, who teaches Maggie how to talk dirty to her new boyfriend (""I'd love it if you stuck your Willy Wonka in between my Oompa-Loompas!""); Samuel L. Jackson, whom Maggie mixes up with Laurence Fishbourne; and Patrick Stewart, who is writing a movie about mind powers, and as many naked women as possible.Part of the genius of ""Extras"" is that it isn't much like any other showbiz parodies -- the lead characters are on the lowest rung of acting, and the big egos are real stars making fun of themselves. Sometimes they play really nasty versions of themselves, such as Winslet saying that she's only making a Holocaust film so she can nab an Oscar.The other half of the comic genius is Gervais' direction, with most of the jokes based on socially awkward situations. It's all about cringing and giggling at once. Those hideously embarrassing situations -- usually with some hilarious dialogue involving the star guests (Stewart: ""The reason you're hearing my rich, sexy voice is that Andy isn't man enough to apologise himself, so he's asked me to do it"").And instead of the obnoxious boss, Andy underplays a sort of befuddled, cynical low-rung worker, but you can really connect with his struggles. He's great when he does things like inadvertantly insult a priest by babbling about pedophilia. Jensen is clumsily charming as Maggie, who tries to be nice to everyone but says all the wrong things (""I like lots of other things, you know -- white or black!"").""Extras"" is a hilarious Britcom with talent to burn and an even funnier acting/directing/writing job by Gervais and Merchant.

I thought this first season was funny overall, but not quite up to the standard of the Office. The humor is the same: watching defective characters in awkwardly uncomfortable situations. I found it funny, but after David Brent, Gervais' Andy Millman character seemed a bit too mundane for me, and his annoying female sidekick's silliness sometimes seemed forced and unrealistic. This series does have some genuinely classic moments though. The funniest aspect is the celebrity cameos, in which big time entertainers play warped versions of themselves. I was laughing out loud at the crass and cynical Kate Winslet, the megalomaniacal Ben Stiller and the girl-crazy, juvenile Patrick Stewart.

1026514,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B000JJ4DDM,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[4, 4]","I absolutely love Ricky Gervais' HBO series, ""Extras"". In my first introduction to the series I didn't 'get it'. But the more I watched the show, the more it began to grow on me. As time went on it occured to me, that this show is just brilliantly funny with a touch of pathos thrown in for good measure.In the first season we meet Andy Millman (Ricky Gervais) a 43 year old, middle age guy, who is on the bottom rungs of show biz, doing ""Extras"" work. These are the folks you see in a film or TV show, who are in the background to give a scene some authenticity. In the entertainment business, they are treated more like props or scenery, rather then 'real' actors. During the course of the show we follow Andy on different British film sets as he is trying to make the jump from being a mere ""Extra"" to actually getting a real speaking part and become a ""proper"" actor. But this seems like an endless, fruitless, exercise in humiliation.  He is joined on this quest by his none-to-bright, best friend and fellow Extra, Maggie Jacobs (hilariously played by Ashley Jensen). Every so often we are also treated to Andy's almost non-sensical, ridiclous meetings with his totally incompetent Agent, Darren Lamb (Stephen Merchent). In most British sit-coms, Darren would be termed a ""total git"".The writing on the show is just top notch. The dialogue is funny and seems to have it's own twisted logic, that often comes back to haunt the characters. I also love the cast and the amazing comic chemistry they have together. Ricky Gervais and Ashley Jensen seem to have a Laurel & Hardy quality. The back & forth conversations these two have, literally leave me on the floor laughing! I could listen to them just banter for the whole 30 minutes of each episode. The same goes for Gervais's conversations with his ridiculous agent played by Stephen Merchant. Their dialogue together plays like something staight out of the 'Mad Tea Party' from ""Alice in Wonderland"". This is a brilliantly funny show. The first season is great! I can't wait for the next season to released to DVD.

For those of you unfamiliar with Gervais, Extras may take some time getting into, but once you do, you'll find a rewarding and comedic experience.  Gervais plays Andy, a bit actor who desperately wants to make the big time.  His partner throughout most of his antics is Maggie (Ashley Jenson), whose acting troubles are overshadowed even more by her man troubles.  Andy's woes are only exasperated by his useless agent (Stephen Merchant), who seems to be doing Andy's would-be career more harm than good.  The real highlight of Extras besides the excellent Gervais is the celebrity guest spots playing themselves on every episode that are brilliantly done.  Ben Stiller is a scream, as is Samuel L. Jackson, while Patrick Stewart is laugh out loud hilarious as he tells Andy of his plans of writing a screenplay where he has mental powers and women have no clothing.  It's Kate Winslet though that will leave you doubling over in laughter, as she attempts to help Maggie in the ""talking dirty"" department.

1026524,A1F1IYH05Q028D,B000JJ4DDM,SamSpade,"[8, 44]","I was very unimpressed with the ""second album"" from gervais and merchant. I kinda liked the the office, but wasn't really thrilled about it either, and in no way did it live up to its hype. But extras fails in almost every respect. And on first glance I was curious as to why it has not received a lower than three rating in these fourty or so reviews. On second thoughts I am sure at least 90% of them represent people who have vested interests in the sales of the dvd, studios or other people involved in the project. One would be very naive to think otherwise considering how easy it is to register and write an online review and what big an influence reviews exert on the buyers. It's been time and again posted on the web how everyone from writers, to film directors, or the marketing department itself form the vast majority of the ""viewer"" opinion. But that's, like I said very much the expected behaviour.The most basic problem with extras it's that there just isn't enough comedic material here, and what little there is it's very rarely funny. Gervais plays an even sadder more toned down version of David Brent of the office (which is essentialy himself, and that's already gotten too tiring), and he's coupled with some Scot blonde whose only storyline is to act dumb and have casual affairs on set. It's no wonder Gervais said Curb your enthusiasm is his favourite show as every single episode here tries to immitate Larry David's wonderful concuction, playing the embarrassement and cringe cards. But whilst David's scriptwriting is tight and well structured with minute observations on life (not all of them very witty of course, but certainly funny), Gervais's and Merchant's isn't. They use some embarassing scenes to end sublots that weren't going anywhere to begin with. In her perpetual search for boyfriend (which we never really know why it always fails actually), Gervais's co-star starts dating a guy working for the production company, only to dump him at the end of the episode because one of his feet is longer than the other. A scene where he puts his extra large shoe on a table in front of her to confront her about this follows, and then Gervais unwittingly makes some racist comments to the producers wife he's been chatting up, hoping to get some lines in the film, which of course he doesn't. Ha, ha, ha. Cringe, embarassment and political correctness, and bad writing too.The use of the celebrity actors (or whatever minor b celebrities that they could get their hands on) doesn't work either. Sometimes (as with Stiller and Jackson) they are used purely for namedropping purposes and add nothing to the storyline. Other times, such as with some minor brit celebrities, their real life stories are integrated with the plot, with their public personas acting accordingly in the script. In either case it's not something organic, and leaves the viewer with a big fat ""who cares?"" Who cares about a brit gameshow host who's career has gone sour, when he makes a fool of himself with self deprating jokes and whines about his decline? Who cares about a brit soap ex star who berates his macho persona as part of the script in extras?The first time I read about Gervais's prospects for his new show, and coming from a similar background (comedy writing for tv) I wondered how anyone could pull such an idea off, incorporating a real life actor as themsleves in every episode, keeping a continuity thread in the series, and managing to be humourous too. Well, as expected he didn't. Some funny sketches with his inept manager are not  enough to salvage this, the female co-star isn't funny either and it's up to gervais and the irrelevant celebrity to cary on their shoulders what it took a whole ensemble in the office to do so...Anyone who's written comedy will tell you why you can't incorporate a guest star when you actually only have two main stars (out of which only one of them in a comedic role), and do so in every episode. And it's not nuclear physics why it's impossible to do so, it's simple mechanics of writing.It's a sad fact, but it's also very telling, that in our culturally stale (as opposed to say technologically or ecomically thriving) societies, ""extras"" is considered as good comedy. But I guess since most things in art and comedy have been done before, and been done better, it's really hard nowadays to come up with something good. Unless someone breaks the mold and starts dwelving at some real issues with a comedic eye, such half witted effort's as ""extras"" is is all we are going to get.",2,And I am being generous with my rating.,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,4548,"['was', 'very', 'unimpressed', 'second', 'album', 'gervais', 'merchant', 'kinda', 'liked', 'office', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'thrilled', 'way', 'did', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'extras', 'fails', 'almost', 'respect', 'first', 'glance', 'was', 'curious', 'why', 'not', 'received', 'lower', 'three', 'rating', 'fourty', 'so', 'reviews', 'second', 'thoughts', 'am', 'sure', 'least', '90', '%', 'represent', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'vested', 'interests', 'sales', 'dvd', 'studios', 'other', 'people', 'involved', 'project', 'One', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'naive', 'think', 'otherwise', 'considering', 'how', 'easy', 'register', 'write', 'online', 'review', 'what', 'big', 'influence', 'exert', 'buyers', 'been', 'time', 'again', 'posted', 'web', 'how', 'everyone', 'writers', 'film', 'directors', 'marketing', 'department', 'form', 'vast', 'majority', 'viewer', 'opinion', 'said', 'very', 'much', 'expected', 'behaviour.The', 'most', 'basic', 'problem', 'extras', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'comedic', 'material', 'here', 'what', 'little', 'very', 'rarely', 'funny', 'Gervais', 'even', 'sadder', 'more', 'toned', 'down', 'version', 'David', 'Brent', 'office', 'essentialy', 'already', 'gotten', 'too', 'tiring', 'coupled', 'Scot', 'blonde', 'only', 'storyline', 'act', 'dumb', 'have', 'casual', 'affairs', 'set', 'wonder', 'Gervais', 'said', 'Curb', 'enthusiasm', 'favourite', 'show', 'single', 'episode', 'here', 'immitate', 'Larry', 'David', 'wonderful', 'concuction', 'playing', 'embarrassement', 'cringe', 'cards', 'David', 'scriptwriting', 'tight', 'well', 'structured', 'minute', 'observations', 'life', 'not', 'very', 'witty', 'course', 'certainly', 'funny', 'Gervais', 'Merchant', ""n't"", 'use', 'embarassing', 'scenes', 'end', 'sublots', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'begin', 'perpetual', 'search', 'boyfriend', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'always', 'actually', 'Gervais', 'co-star', 'dating', 'guy', 'working', 'production', 'company', 'only', 'dump', 'end', 'episode', 'one', 'feet', 'longer', 'other', 'scene', 'where', 'extra', 'large', 'shoe', 'table', 'front', 'confront', 'then', 'Gervais', 'unwittingly', 'racist', 'comments', 'producers', 'wife', 'been', 'chatting', 'up', 'hoping', 'get', 'lines', 'film', 'course', ""n't"", 'Ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'Cringe', 'embarassment', 'political', 'correctness', 'bad', 'writing', 'too.The', 'use', 'celebrity', 'actors', 'minor', 'b', 'celebrities', 'could', 'get', 'hands', ""n't"", 'work', 'either', 'Sometimes', 'Stiller', 'Jackson', 'are', 'used', 'purely', 'namedropping', 'purposes', 'add', 'nothing', 'storyline', 'Other', 'times', 'such', 'minor', 'brit', 'celebrities', 'real', 'life', 'stories', 'are', 'integrated', 'plot', 'public', 'personas', 'acting', 'accordingly', 'script', 'case', 'not', 'something', 'organic', 'viewer', 'big', 'fat', 'who', 'Who', 'brit', 'gameshow', 'host', 'who', 'career', 'gone', 'sour', 'when', 'fool', 'self', 'deprating', 'jokes', 'whines', 'decline', 'Who', 'brit', 'soap', 'ex', 'star', 'who', 'macho', 'persona', 'part', 'script', 'extras', 'first', 'time', 'read', 'Gervais', 'prospects', 'new', 'show', 'coming', 'similar', 'background', 'comedy', 'writing', 'tv', 'wondered', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'pull', 'idea', 'off', 'incorporating', 'real', 'life', 'actor', 'themsleves', 'episode', 'keeping', 'continuity', 'thread', 'series', 'managing', 'be', 'humourous', 'too', 'Well', 'expected', 'did', ""n't"", 'funny', 'sketches', 'inept', 'manager', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'salvage', 'female', 'co-star', ""n't"", 'funny', 'either', 'up', 'gervais', 'irrelevant', 'celebrity', 'cary', 'shoulders', 'what', 'took', 'whole', 'ensemble', 'office', 'do', 'so', 'Anyone', 'who', 'written', 'comedy', 'will', 'tell', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'incorporate', 'guest', 'star', 'when', 'actually', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'only', 'one', 'comedic', 'role', 'do', 'so', 'episode', 'not', 'nuclear', 'physics', 'why', 'impossible', 'do', 'so', 'simple', 'mechanics', 'writing.It', 'sad', 'fact', 'also', 'very', 'telling', 'culturally', 'stale', 'opposed', 'say', 'technologically', 'ecomically', 'thriving', 'societies', 'extras', 'considered', 'good', 'comedy', 'guess', 'most', 'things', 'art', 'comedy', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'really', 'hard', 'nowadays', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'good', 'someone', 'mold', 'dwelving', 'real', 'issues', 'comedic', 'eye', 'such', 'half', 'witted', 'effort', 'extras', 'are', 'going', 'get']",N/A

There are so many subtle facial expressions and jokes involved in every episode. Ricky Gervais's new character, Andy Millman, is (as the name implies) a sort of everyman who is constantly working as a ""background performer"" on movie sets, although he fancies himself a ""real actor"". Trouble is, he's never had so much as a line in anything. This is due in part to his inept agent, played with brilliant daftness by co-creator and co-director Stephen Merchant.All six episodes feature cameos from actual celebrities who are more than happy to mock their media perceived personas. The episodes feature Kate Winslett, Ben Stiller, Samuel L. Jackson, Patrick Stewart, Ross Kemp, Vinnie Jones, and Les Dennis. All are clearly having a great time skewering themselves to the benefit of the viewer. Kate Winslett is crass and just out to get an Oscar, Ben Stiller is rude, self-centered, and insecure, and Patrick Stewart is dim-witted and slightly perverse. All are hilarious.But the celebrity guest stars aren't the focus of the show. The show is really about Andy and his friend Maggie (Ashley Jensen) and their interactions with other people on the sets and in their day-to-day lives. Maggie is often trying to woo any man on set to go out with her, while Andy is always working at getting himself a line in the film or tv show of the day.Although Extras does feature some Merchant/Gervais social awkwardness humor, it's not as uncomfortable as The Office, and often it is the characters around Andy that make the situation uncomfortable and not Andy himself. Overall the show is hilarious and a joy to watch.I'm not sure why it's on a 2 DVD set, since there are only 6 episodes. There are quite a few special features included, mostly on the second disc. The outtakes are some of the best I've seen, mostly consisting of Ricky Gervais repeatedly breaking character and as take by take go by, we see his infectious laugh causing the other actor in the scene to break character. There's a short featuring Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais frantically trying to locate a new actor to replace Jude Law after Law backed out of an episode featuring him. Their failure to locate anyone assoicated with Leonardo DiCaprio (their first choice) is painfully funny. The deleted scenes are funny, but it's clear why they were deleted. Typically they would hvae thrown off the flow of the show.This is a great series to own and these 6 episodes are better than most other shows on television right now. What I'd like to see is Larry David in a cameo here. Maybe for season 3.",5,Extras features a-list celebs and hilarious extras,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,2670,"['Extras', 'kind', 'show', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'then', 'when', 'sit', 'back', 'down', 'watch', 'again', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'jokes', 'involved', 'episode', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'new', 'character', 'Andy', 'Millman', 'name', 'implies', 'sort', 'everyman', 'who', 'constantly', 'working', 'background', 'performer', 'movie', 'sets', 'real', 'actor', 'Trouble', 'never', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'line', 'anything', 'due', 'part', 'inept', 'agent', 'played', 'brilliant', 'daftness', 'co-creator', 'co-director', 'Stephen', 'Merchant.All', 'six', 'feature', 'cameos', 'actual', 'celebrities', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'happy', 'mock', 'media', 'perceived', 'personas', 'episodes', 'feature', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ross', 'Kemp', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'Les', 'Dennis', 'are', 'clearly', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'skewering', 'benefit', 'viewer', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'crass', 'just', 'out', 'get', 'Oscar', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'rude', 'self-centered', 'insecure', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'dim-witted', 'slightly', 'perverse', 'are', 'celebrity', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', ""n't"", 'focus', 'show', 'show', 'really', 'Andy', 'friend', 'Maggie', 'Ashley', 'Jensen', 'interactions', 'other', 'people', 'sets', 'day-to-day', 'lives', 'Maggie', 'often', 'trying', 'woo', 'man', 'set', 'go', 'out', 'Andy', 'always', 'working', 'getting', 'line', 'film', 'tv', 'show', 'day.Although', 'Extras', 'feature', 'Merchant/Gervais', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'humor', 'not', 'as', 'uncomfortable', 'Office', 'often', 'characters', 'Andy', 'make', 'situation', 'uncomfortable', 'not', 'Andy', 'show', 'hilarious', 'joy', 'watch.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'only', '6', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'mostly', 'second', 'disc', 'outtakes', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'mostly', 'consisting', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'repeatedly', 'breaking', 'character', 'take', 'take', 'go', 'see', 'infectious', 'laugh', 'causing', 'other', 'actor', 'scene', 'break', 'character', 'short', 'featuring', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'frantically', 'trying', 'locate', 'new', 'actor', 'replace', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Law', 'backed', 'episode', 'featuring', 'failure', 'locate', 'anyone', 'assoicated', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'first', 'choice', 'painfully', 'funny', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'clear', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'Typically', 'would', 'hvae', 'thrown', 'off', 'flow', 'show.This', 'great', 'series', 'own', '6', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'What', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'Larry', 'David', 'cameo', 'here', 'Maybe', 'season', '3']",N/A
