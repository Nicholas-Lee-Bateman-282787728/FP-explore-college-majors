1037587,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000LAZDQA,,"[11, 26]","I purchased this DVD sight unseen because so many people told me I had to see it.  Nay, so many people insisted that I simply HAD to own it.  It was, they implied, the most revolutionary film ever released, and the next logical step in the Progression of Cinema - the Cinema of the Future.  I'm sorry, but in the end, I was completely disappointed.Not that it didn't seem to have several things going for it, at least initially.  To begin with, the film opens with the most candid and realistic depiction of sex I have ever seen in a non-pornographic film, and for a few minutes I thought I was viewing something genuinely revolutionary.  And, also initially, it seemed to have a few candid and profound things to say about troubled relationships, until I figured out half-way through it that the characters in those relationships weren't really very interesting, or (with one exception) very likable, either.This cinematic sex-fest was immediately different from pornography in that, not only did it appear that the characters were really having sex, they seemed to be doing so in a perfectly natural manner.  That is, the opening sequence seemed inhabited by real people, none of them extremely attractive (well, not to me), engaging in sex acts that appeared quite convincing.  As anyone knows, the point of pornography is sexual titillation.  Despite claims of ""redeeming social value"", all pornographic films exist so that the viewer may achieve prurient satisfaction from watching fantasy sex scenes with beautiful people.  The sex in Shortbus is anything but arousing; the participants not only appear to be really having sex with each other (and I believe they actually were), the sex seemed downright mundane.  So I was immediately struck by the believability of the opening scene, including the act involving a dominatrix prostitute, and one character's self-filmed auto-fellatio.  Believe it or not, that's where reality ended, and surrealism began to seep in.The basic plot concerns a sex therapist named Sofia, played by the amazingly talented Sook-Yin Lee.  Ms. Lee was easily the most engaging thing about Shortbus, and her performance alone was the most enjoyable aspect of the film; she also presented the most likable character.  In the film, Sofia remarks several times that she does not want to be referred to as a sex therapist, but she prefers to be called a relationship counselor.  I kept thinking that neither her character nor the film's creators seemed to be aware that a sex therapist and a relationship counselor are not the same thing.  Anyway, Sofia is having her first session with a gay couple, James and Jamie, one of whom is a former child star and the other a former prostitute, when she inadvertently blurts out to them that she has never achieved an orgasm, despite her ""perfect"" relationship with her husband, Rob (who may or may not be gay himself).  In a sort of bizarre role reversal, James and Jamie suggest to Sofia that she try Shortbus.  What is Shortbus, exactly?  I spent the rest of the film trying to figure that out.Shortbus appears to be some sort of combination sexual workshop / voyeur's retreat / cabaret, where those who are sexually confused, no longer attracted to their partners, or otherwise sexually hung up / inhibited / you-pretty-much-name-it can go to work out their sexual problems through uninhibited sexual play with a variety of partners and fellow sufferers.  The biggest problem I had was that virtually all of the patrons of Shortbus seemed totally immersed in their own shallow worlds, endlessly crying about their sexual problems until working them out through hours of joyous, uninhibited sex.  At one early point, one character remarks how hot the gay couple is.  Aside from their youth, I didn't get what was supposed to be so hot about them, as I am generally neither into twinks nor vapid, shallow people.  I didn't find much attractive about the rest of the cast, either.The film takes place in New York City.  I am a gay man who has lived all my life in New York City, and I have never met people who even vaguely resemble the characters in Shortbus, nor would I want to.  I can imagine (in fact, in the wild 1970's, I have even been to) places in NYC that resemble Shortbus (if for nothing else, the wild sexual orgies reflected therein) but such places, few and far between (and now largely extinct) would have been organized and run by the Mafia purely for profit, and patronized solely by the sexually compulsive, for no other reason than the sex itself.  One would certainly not expect to find such a place filled with whole rooms of the sexually repressed, working their way to sexual health through a sort of sexual group therapy.  And the first thing I noticed about the mythical Shortbus club (if one could call it a club - I still don't know what to call it) is that it seemed to be operated entirely on someone's charity.  I never saw anyone collect an entrance fee, or discuss ""terms of membership"".  I kept wondering how such a multi-roomed sex orgy / cabaret / sex therapy ""establishment"" could exist on the Island of Manhattan virtually for free, where a hamburger and a beer is likely to set you back $[...] these days, and even then you are hustled out the door of most restaurants in less than an hour.  I got the impression that some of the inhabitants of Shortbus had been there for days, a prospect that seemed to me to be possible for the super-rich only.As I say, there were some aspects of the film I thought were genuinely worthwhile, mostly the comedic moments, and a few of those were genuinely funny (especially the appearance of a character clearly based on former mayor Ed Koch).  The celebrated ""Star Spangled Banner scene"" struck me as puerile and tasteless, and I have never been accused of being a prude.  I sure didn't enjoy it for the drama, which was strained throughout, and bordered on bad soap opera.  Soap opera with sex.  I have nothing against sex, but the soap opera-lives of the main characters were boring as could be.  At one point, I glanced at the digital readout on my DVD player, and sighed as I realized I needed to sit through this movie for another hour, never a good sign.  At the film's climax, everyone's self-absorbed problems seemed to be magically solved, and the whole cast gathered together for a good natured sing along.  As the credits started to roll, I realized with a jolt that the few minutes of entertainment I managed to glean from the proceedings were not worth the amount of time I had wasted watching the film as a whole, and I rolled my eyes as I yanked the disc from the machine and filed it on my shelf, probably never to be watched again.  Revolutionary?  Perhaps, but the lapses in logic, the extreme surrealism (especially for a film touted for its realism) and the shallowness of its main characters all contributed to my ultimate  dissatisfaction.I have heard nothing but great things about the director's earlier work, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, but after reading various reviews, I decided it probably wasn't for me.  Now I guess I'll never know, because there is no way I intend to subject myself to another film by John Cameron Mitchell.  And I expect to be very, very cautious in the future when someone tells me about a film I simply MUST own.",3,Long Ride on a Short Bus,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,7311,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'sight',

One reviewer here asked where they could get more films like this ... try an adult bookstore. Another reviewer compared it to Caligua. No comparison. Production values alone in Caligula far outweigh those in Shortbus which are weak and mostly non-existent -- even the Georgina Spelvin ""The Devil In Miss Jones"" (1973) had more than Shortbus. There have always been artists (and I use that word loosely here) that try to push the envelope when they create their art. But Mr. Mitchell doesn't.  Robert Mapplethorp, for example, was a brilliant artist. Mr. Mitchell isn't.

1037589,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000LAZDQA,,"[1, 4]","With Shortbus we have sex as therapy and obsession.

Some are gay, some are straight and all look sad or anxious, even when they're coupling. They all find their way to a Manhattan sex club where meaningful glances, gauzy curtains, more-or-less private rooms, sex and a remarkably unattractive cross-dressing singer help them find themselves.

The trouble with Shortbus is that the point of the movie - characters trying to find themselves, in this case through sex - is a clich&eacute;.

Such is the case with Shortbus. Granted, if you take away the sex scenes you still have an interesting story (hence my three star rating).  But if the story can stand alone with out the explicit sex then why bother putting it in? This film could have been just as effective with simulated sex scenes or even implied sex scenes.  For me, the explicit sex took away from the story and seemed to be a contrived shock factor ticket selling ploy from Mitchell who probably couldn't top the sheer brilliance of Hedwig. I was also disturbed that no one in this film practiced safe sex. It's irresponsible and shocking on the actors and director's part.  I am all for films that explore sex and sexuality.

Whilst Sofia finds the sex satisfying, ironically, given her profession, she is yet to have an orgasm. This quest becomes one of the themes of the film.She meets clients James (Paul Dawson - who looks a lot like Mark Whalberg) and Jamie (PJ DeBoy), a gay couple having their own relationship problems. They recommend to her to attend a club called ""Shortbus"" which is an anything goes sex club.Sofia protests to all that she is in a very happy relationship with her husband, whom she loves. Her relationship with him seems to be happy. She stumbles upon a group of lesbians including Severin (aka Jennifer) (Lindsay Beamish) who we see earlier in the film as a dominatrix. Severin can't form a relationship with anyone. Sofia breaches professional guidelines by both acting as counsellor for Severin, and having sex with her.That's the problem with this film. Whilst it is trying to promote a 'guilt-free' sex enviornment ultimately several of the lead characters continue to have relationship problems. All they end up doing is realigning their sex partners. This then becomes the social engineering message of the film. That: relationships don't matter, sex does. I found this annoying given that the film argues against itself in that several of the characters still desire to have relationships. Sure James and Jamie become a foursome (with the addition of Caleb, their stalker (Peter Stickles) and Ceth (Jay Brannan)), but the others do not progress to their own desired outcome.

Actors and actresses are sometimes having sex on the screen.Now that that's out of way, for those of you into a little love with your sex, you'll find that too. But Shortbus is about all kinds of love: frustrated hetero love, homosexual love trifectas, roomfuls of people who love lots of people at once. It's about love for oneself and love for others. It's about satisfying the need for sexual orgasm and satisfying the need for friendship, attachment, commitment, and more emotional love. It deals with a troubled gay couple, a dissatisfied dominatrix-for-hire, a couples counselor who can't have an orgasm, and a wild club called Shortbus run by a cross-dresser who says the name comes because ""special"" people ride the short bus. That's true, yeah, but also emotionally, intellectually and socially stunted people ride the short bus, and you'll find those people, too.Try not to zone out when characters go off on extended monologues or when the musical scenes drown out the dialogue and drone a little too long, and you'll find some new, fun looks at relationships and sexuality for the 21st century.My personal opinion, though it differs from my wife, is this film suffers from the collaborative storytelling that involved Mitchell spending two years working with his performers to develop the plot and the characters.

There are scenes of unsimulated sex & similarly awkward references to homosexuality, drugs, etc. that a lot of people just aren't really comfortable with.However, if you can overcome that (and hopefully, as adults, most people can) and appreciate the movie for what it is, you'll find that Shortbus is, at its core, a funny, endearing, clever, entertaining, and innovative movie. It's definitely not for the kids, but neither are most action or adult comedy movies.I felt a little uncomfortable watching this movie in the living room while my male roommates could hear and see some of what was going on, and wasn't sure how I felt about the movie. As I re-watched it though I realized that what I'd bought was really worth the money -- a unique and truly entertaining movie ripe with all the elements you'd look for in any other good film.There is a lot of sex, and it's supposed to be unsimulated, but it's not ALL sex, and it's not porn. The comedy, drama, and philosophy are somehow interwoven into those scenes just as they are with the others, and after a viewing or two you'll be able to watch the movie from end to end without flinching, 'cos you'll understand what the movie is really about.If you can get past seeing some naked people and aren't a gay-hater, then give this movie a shot, because it really is worth seeing.",5,"An entertaining, endearing, and bold movie.",1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,1427,"['Most', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'knee-jerk', 'reaction', 'Shortbus', 'minute', 'hitting', ""'play"", 'are', 'scenes', 'unsimulated', 'sex', 'similarly', 'awkward', 'references', 'homosexuality', 'drugs', 'etc', 'lot', 'people', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'comfortable', 'with.However', 'can', 'overcome', 'hopefully', 'adults', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'what', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Shortbus', 'core', 'funny', 'endearing', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'innovative', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'kids', 'are', 'most', 'action', 'adult', 'comedy', 'movies.I', 'felt', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'movie', 'living', 'room', 'male', 'roommates', 'could', 'hear', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'felt', 'movie', 're-watched', 'realized', 'what', ""'d"", 'bought', 'was', 'really', 'worth', 'money', 'unique', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'ripe', 'elements', ""'d"", 'look', 'other', 'good', 'film.There', 'lot', 'sex', 'supposed', 'be', 'unsimulated', 'not', 'ALL', 'sex', 'not', 'porn', 'comedy', 'drama', 'philosophy', 'are', 'somehow', 'interwoven', 'scenes', 'just', 'are', 'others', 'viewing', 'two', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'movie', 'end', 'end', 'flinching', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about.If', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'seeing', 'naked', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'gay-hater', 'then', 'give', 'movie', 'shot', 'really', 'worth', 'seeing']",Shortbus

So of course I was excited to hear that John Cameron Mitchel was going to do a movie that was going to skewer the preoccupation of the ratings boards with promoting violence over sex by producing a mainstream movie with sex scenes as an integral part..  I felt that it was long overdue thought it would be an entertaining and important movie.Fast forward to the reality... Mr. Mitchell has obviously been living for too long in the post Hedwig Bubble leaving him completely out of touch with real life.  It isn't groundbreaking nor does it challenge conventional wisdom when you make a movie containing explicit sex scenes in which the plot revolves in a large part around sex. (Please spare me the ""It's about relationships"" line.  These relationships were so artificial they make Cool Whip look Natural.Basically the movie is a pseudo-intellectual higher budget version of a 3rd year film students performance art project.  It relies on dialog that would be unrealistic anywhere but a womyns studies retreat or in an abnormal psychology class.  The problem with being a success in the film arts world is obviously a lack of ability in figuring out what is realistic behavior and what isn't.If you really honestly want to turn convention on it's ear and show the film ratings for the hypocrisy that they are with regards to sex on screen it would pack a much larger punch, to show a conventional plotline with the sex scenes not edited out.  i.e. Pretty Women, have the hooker and the businessman have full sex.  A James Bond style film, show the consummation with him and the foreign spy, a Horror film, have the couples have sex on screen before being killed etc...But to show a movie in which everybody is wondering around in a Zoloft induced haze stumbling into a sex club that is a pale imitation of stories about Berlin in the 1930's even to the addition to the cast of the host walking around imitating Joel Grey from Cabaret is just pure boring self indulgent pap.  The end part, when one of the cast finally has anal sex with his stalker, then stands at the window catching the eye of his boyfriend in the apartment across the alley where they then begin to smile at each other may have sounded good after Mr. Mitchell's 3rd Pot brownie but frankly was just a lame attempt at a meaningful ending that was the last gasp of a movie drowning in it's own misguided self importance.To say I was disappointed after the promise of Hedwig would be putting it mildly.

1037613,A17CI96G5AURB,B000LAZDQA,"Chuck Steak ""hoping to improve accountability...","[2, 3]","I have mixed reviews about shortbus.  I heard about it here on amazon because of all the rave reviews and the appeal of the sexuality. In retrospect, I am confused on all the perfect reviews of this movie.  Beware! There are spoilers!From the beginning scene to the end, I was definitely enthralled and did not look away.  I am not used to seeing sex on film so raw, so real, so gay (sorry but I've never seen a gay porn) yet not be a porn movie.  For the most part, I thought the actors and actresses did a remarkable job.  How brave they all must be to bare all in a non-porn setting!  And I certainly admire the vision, or at least my interpretation of the vision, which is to show sex and relationships in a way Hollywood will never grant us--lifelike.  I like that it tries to demolish the uptight American view of sexuality and catch us up with the rest of the world (Europe, anyway.)  And I like that this movie was seemingly made for women and gay men; although I'm straight I liked the openness and relaxed nature that Hollywood would never portray to this audience.  The actors and actresses were very beautiful but in a realistic way; the female form never looked so good and was paired with men and women alike, without the unbelievable airbrushing and body doubles in movies today.  And it was kind of nice that the penis was not the forbidden genital like in all our movies outside of porn.  But there many things I did not particularly like- at times the story and the acting were lacking.The story I liked at times but overall it felt shallow and poorly thought out.  And some things did not make a lick of sense.  A sex therapist that is pre-orgasmic and blows up at her clients, physically assaulting them?  And after, following them to a sex club without her love being aware?  What sense did it make that Jennifer (sorry severin) formed a bond with our troubled sex therapist by taking a polaroid of an unbelievable dialogue between Sofia and a group of strangers?  I guess the therapist had no awareness that her view on sex and her sex life was sad, pathetic, and misguided.Rob seemed to be pretty damn carefree regarding Sofia's actions throughout the whole movie.  I don't know if this was poor writing or acting.  I also like how Sofia never consulted her true love one time before kissing or touching strangers.  Nor did most of the characters for that matter, save James and Jamie, and their ease of bringing a stranger into the relationship was totally unbelievable.And the vibrator scene?  Completely ridiculous.  In this scene both Sofia and Rob failed miserably in selling this to the audience.And the worst part of this movie by far was the stalker.  Wow.  Anything to do with that poorly written and performed character was completely unbelievable and laughable.  He works from home and has been watching and following everyone for years without anyone noticing.  Right.  I don't care if you're gay or straight or what- you would call the cops in a second and be furious if you found that you had a stalker.  Why did Jamie have sex with him at the end of the movie? And why did his frantically worried partner smile at him across the alleyway?  Don't you think James would have been a little upset?  Thanks for the call to let me know you're alive Jamie, and I'm glad your sleeping with a creep 20 feet from our place.I'm glad Sofia finally discovered an orgasm; you'd think being a sex therapist and all she'd have the resources or at least be able to seek professional assistance to resolve this before now.The ending... How disappointed I was to see everything wrapped up in a neat little happy package at the end of the movie just like all our Hollywood mainstream movies.I know this review is harsh especially in comparison to the others, and I know that alot of hard work was put into this, but overall it was just ok and it certainly doesn't deserve all the perfect ratings.",3,Interesting to say the least...,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,3914,"['have', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'shortbus', 'heard', 'here', 'amazon', 'rave', 'reviews', 'appeal', 'sexuality', 'retrospect', 'am', 'confused', 'perfect', 'reviews', 'movie', 'Beware', 'are', 'spoilers', 'beginning', 'scene', 'end', 'was', 'definitely', 'enthralled', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'away', 'am', 'not', 'used', 'seeing', 'sex', 'film', 'so', 'raw', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'gay', 'sorry', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'gay', 'porn', 'yet', 'not', 'be', 'porn', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'thought', 'actors', 'actresses', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'How', 'brave', 'must', 'be', 'bare', 'non-porn', 'setting', 'certainly', 'admire', 'vision', 'least', 'interpretation', 'vision', 'show', 'sex', 'relationships', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'never', 'grant', 'lifelike', 'demolish', 'uptight', 'American', 'view', 'sexuality', 'catch', 'up', 'rest', 'world', 'Europe', 'anyway', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'seemingly', 'made', 'women', 'gay', 'men', ""'m"", 'straight', 'liked', 'openness', 'relaxed', 'nature', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'never', 'portray', 'audience', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'very', 'beautiful', 'realistic', 'way', 'female', 'form', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'paired', 'men', 'women', 'alike', 'unbelievable', 'airbrushing', 'body', 'doubles', 'movies', 'today', 'was', 'kind', 'nice', 'penis', 'was', 'not', 'forbidden', 'genital', 'movies', 'porn', 'there', 'many', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'like-', 'times', 'story', 'acting', 'were', 'lacking.The', 'story', 'liked', 'times', 'overall', 'felt', 'shallow', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'lick', 'sense', 'sex', 'therapist', 'pre-orgasmic', 'up', 'clients', 'physically', 'assaulting', 'following', 'sex', 'club', 'love', 'being', 'aware', 'What', 'sense', 'did', 'make', 'Jennifer', 'sorry', 'severin', 'formed', 'bond', 'troubled', 'sex', 'therapist', 'taking', 'polaroid', 'unbelievable', 'dialogue', 'Sofia', 'group', 'strangers', 'guess', 'therapist', 'had', 'awareness', 'view', 'sex', 'sex', 'life', 'was', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'misguided.Rob', 'seemed', 'be', 'pretty', 'damn', 'carefree', 'regarding', 'Sofia', 'actions', 'whole', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'poor', 'writing', 'acting', 'also', 'how', 'Sofia', 'never', 'consulted', 'true', 'love', 'one', 'time', 'kissing', 'touching', 'strangers', 'did', 'most', 'characters', 'matter', 'save', 'James', 'Jamie', 'ease', 'bringing', 'stranger', 'relationship', 'was', 'totally', 'unbelievable.And', 'vibrator', 'scene', 'Completely', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'Sofia', 'Rob', 'failed', 'miserably', 'selling', 'audience.And', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'far', 'was', 'stalker', 'Wow', 'Anything', 'do', 'poorly', 'written', 'performed', 'character', 'was', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'laughable', 'home', 'been', 'watching', 'following', 'everyone', 'years', 'anyone', 'noticing', 'Right', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'re"", 'gay', 'straight', 'what-', 'would', 'call', 'cops', 'second', 'be', 'furious', 'found', 'had', 'stalker', 'Why', 'did', 'Jamie', 'have', 'sex', 'end', 'movie', 'why', 'did', 'frantically', 'worried', 'partner', 'smile', 'alleyway', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'James', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'upset', 'Thanks', 'call', 'let', 'know', ""'re"", 'alive', 'Jamie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'sleeping', 'creep', '20', 'feet', 'place.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Sofia', 'finally', 'discovered', 'orgasm', ""'d"", 'think', 'being', 'sex', 'therapist', ""'d"", 'have', 'resources', 'least', 'be', 'able', 'seek', 'professional', 'assistance', 'resolve', 'now.The', 'ending', 'How', 'disappointed', 'was', 'see', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'happy', 'package', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'mainstream', 'movies.I', 'know', 'review', 'harsh', 'especially', 'comparison', 'others', 'know', 'alot', 'hard', 'work', 'was', 'put', 'overall', 'was', 'just', 'ok', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'perfect', 'ratings']",Shortbus
1037614,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000LAZDQA,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 4]","Films that deal primarily with sex are quite plentiful but there's usually a weakened knowledge of the film in the general media. Aside from the controversy it'll raise over the explicitness of the scenes, most movies barely get attention other than people wanting to check out a hot actor or actress do something naughty. One of the few to get attention outside of the sex was Shortbus, directed by John Cameron Mitchell who did Hedwig and the Angry Inch. So how's the film as a whole? Well it's not as great as everyone says it is. I like the approach and idea behind it; I just wish there was a better movie attached to it.The film's central character is Sofia, a sex-therapist or self-proclaimed ""couples counsellor"" who has never had an orgasm despite having a rather energetic sex life. A couple she sees, and other central characters are Jamie and James, a gay couple who want to expand their relationship and make it more open. They refer her to ""Shortbus"", a club for people looking to advance their sexual experiences. She also meets Severin, a dominatrix who finds it hard to connect with others. All of the characters have to connect to each other and figure out just what they need.Of course, I must first address the sex. Unlike some unrated/NC-17 films that are just clearly oversensitive ratings board members, this film truly earns its rating. There is so much graphic sex, I was wondering if hardcore filmmakers decided to get all ""arty"" on us. Some of it works while others (such as the strangest Star Spangled Banner performance ever) is funny but then some is just unbelievably unnecessary (such as a character who basically self-fellates). It's of course a movie about sex but after awhile it just feels like they put it in since they got away with other scenes, what else can they do? To the filmmakers credit though, as was mentioned later in the commentary, the sex gets less graphic the further into the film we get and development characters get. On that level, it's a good balance and not just using sex as a shock value.Main thing is of course the acting. Well, they're pretty good with one looking like a throwback to Ziggy Stardust era David Bowie, a really tattooed (but quite beautiful woman) to a character who almost seems to just basically cry a lot. I'm not really knocking the performances but they just don't really stand out amongst everyone else. The only one who does is Sook-Yin Lee but that's because, being Canadian, I grew up watching her be a MuchMusic VJ. As far as the story is concerned, well, at times it just seemed kind of slow. It's a short movie (90 minutes) but some scenes almost seem to just keep going and going and it would've been nice if some were at least cut down a tad.Some will love it because it takes a realistic viewpoint into sex and shows it as a human experience rather than this thing we have to downplay while others hate it for what the film is or just what it didn't do.

1037615,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000LAZDQA,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[1, 1]","And not all of them are angry!  All of them are explored, however, in very graphic detail.  Yes, in ""Shortbus,"" fiercely talented writer/director John Cameron Mitchell attempts to follow up his superb debut (""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") with a film that looks deeper into the human condition, both emotionally and corporeally.The film opens with a whimsical camera shot, swingin' swooshin' and swoopin' through and around a beautiful pastel skyline model of New York, over the swaggerin' sounds of a walking bass line.  That we are looking at a (literally) colorful representation of New York here is important, as some of the events that follow - especially those at the Shortbus salon itself - are meant to, I think, evoke a colorful representation of an idyllic (but not necessarily 100 percent realistic) place where one can go to work through one's sexual and emotional issues without fear of scorn or reprisal.Some of the characters working on these issues include Sook-Yin Lee as Sofia, the sex therapist (oops, I mean ""couples counselor"") who can't negotiate the long and winding road that leads from her G spot to the big O (and no, I'm not talking about Gail and Oprah here).  Paul Dawson and PJ DeBoy are James and Jamie, who take in Jay Brannan's Ceth as the new meat in their five year old monogamy sandwich.And along the way, there are enough strongly presented, well-performed and emotionally charged moments in this film to make it much more than ""that mainstream film with all the graphic sex.""  Plus it has a terrific soundtrack (Jay Brannan's song ""Soda Shop,"" which repeats on the DVD main menu, is especially catchy).  That being said, I think ""Shortbus"" ultimately pulls up a little, um, short when compared to the brilliance of ""Hedwig"".  In a way, John Cameron Mitchell made a nearly impossible task for himself by making such an outstanding first film - how do you follow something as instantly iconic as Hedwig?In ""Shortbus,"" we get an envelope-pushing, genre-busting and daring film that truly is, I feel, the first film featuring graphic sex to have its other story elements resonate through and beyond the mere carnal titillation.  That in itself is no small achievement.  But, to me, ""Shortbus"" is no ""Hedwig"" in terms of overall cinematic inspiration.  And maybe it's not meant to be.  And maybe it's not fair to compare.  Smaller in scale and ambition, ""Shortbus"" still succeeds for the most part on its own merits.  I just wish the shadow of Hedwig hadn't loomed so large.I would ultimately give this film 3.5 stars, but because of the excellent DVD features as well as my respect for the sheer bravado required to pull off a project such as this, I'm rounding up to 4 stars for this particular product.",4,Looks Like Hedwig's Found A Few More Inches!,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,2736,"['not', 'are', 'angry', 'are', 'explored', 'however', 'very', 'graphic', 'detail', 'Yes', 'Shortbus', 'fiercely', 'talented', 'writer/director', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'follow', 'up', 'superb', 'debut', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'film', 'deeper', 'human', 'condition', 'emotionally', 'corporeally.The', 'film', 'opens', 'whimsical', 'camera', 'shot', 'swingin', 'swooshin', 'swoopin', 'beautiful', 'pastel', 'skyline', 'model', 'New', 'York', 'swaggerin', 'sounds', 'walking', 'bass', 'line', 'are', 'looking', 'literally', 'colorful', 'representation', 'New', 'York', 'here', 'important', 'events', 'follow', 'especially', 'Shortbus', 'salon', 'are', 'meant', 'think', 'evoke', 'colorful', 'representation', 'idyllic', 'not', 'necessarily', '100', 'percent', 'realistic', 'place', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'go', 'work', 'one', 'sexual', 'emotional', 'issues', 'fear', 'scorn', 'reprisal.Some', 'characters', 'working', 'issues', 'include', 'Sook-Yin', 'Lee', 'Sofia', 'sex', 'therapist', 'oops', 'mean', 'couples', 'counselor', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'negotiate', 'long', 'winding', 'road', 'G', 'spot', 'big', 'O', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'Gail', 'Oprah', 'here', 'Paul', 'Dawson', 'PJ', 'DeBoy', 'are', 'James', 'Jamie', 'who', 'take', 'Jay', 'Brannan', 'Ceth', 'new', 'meat', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'monogamy', 'sandwich.And', 'way', 'are', 'enough', 'strongly', 'presented', 'well-performed', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'moments', 'film', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'mainstream', 'film', 'graphic', 'sex', 'terrific', 'soundtrack', 'Jay', 'Brannan', 'song', 'Soda', 'Shop', 'DVD', 'main', 'menu', 'especially', 'catchy', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'Shortbus', 'ultimately', 'up', 'little', 'um', 'short', 'when', 'compared', 'brilliance', 'Hedwig', 'way', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'made', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'task', 'making', 'such', 'outstanding', 'first', 'film', 'how', 'do', 'follow', 'something', 'instantly', 'iconic', 'Hedwig', 'Shortbus', 'get', 'envelope-pushing', 'genre-busting', 'daring', 'film', 'truly', 'feel', 'first', 'film', 'featuring', 'graphic', 'sex', 'have', 'other', 'story', 'elements', 'resonate', 'mere', 'carnal', 'titillation', 'small', 'achievement', 'Shortbus', 'Hedwig', 'terms', 'overall', 'cinematic', 'inspiration', 'maybe', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'maybe', 'not', 'fair', 'compare', 'Smaller', 'scale', 'ambition', 'Shortbus', 'still', 'most', 'part', 'own', 'merits', 'just', 'wish', 'shadow', 'Hedwig', 'had', ""n't"", 'loomed', 'so', 'large.I', 'would', 'ultimately', 'give', 'film', '3.5', 'stars', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'features', 'as', 'well', 'respect', 'sheer', 'bravado', 'required', 'pull', 'off', 'project', 'such', ""'m"", 'rounding', 'up', '4', 'stars', 'particular', 'product']",Shortbus

By the end of the first few minutes, I had placed the popcorn back on the end table and cleaned my hands so as to not butter up the rewind button on the remote.  I was totally taken off guard, but in a pleasant way.  I liked this movie for several different reasons.First, Shortbus pushed the edge in terms of sexual content.  The movie contains both straight and gay sex scenes, so there is something of interest for just about everyone.  And many of the scenes occur in group setting, with all types of people of varying orientations taking part.  I appreciated the inclusive nature of the film, which is one reason why I liked the movie so much.  The scenes in the movie are not gratuitous, but are done in artistic tone.The movie also touches on other issues besides sex, such as depression, suicide, the intricate nature and philosophy of romantic love, promiscuity, the machinations of the female anatomy/orgasm, the importance of being oneself despite whatever societal pressures might abound, friendship, compassion, and most of all, solidarity in a world of unknowns.Shortbus is a very special place.  It is a place where most people can go and feel welcomed.  Whether you are straight or gay, thin or large, beautiful or not-so-beautiful, introvert or extrovert, young or old, liberal or conservative, and whatever other designations one could think of, it does not matter.  Shortbus is a place to commune with others and share whatever it is you would like to share.For me, Shortbus is a metaphor for what the world could be if we all would be a little less judgemental and a little more accepting, compassionate, and empathetic.  It is a place we all could identify with if we would only let go of those things that bind us to our misconceptions and anachronisms.....",5,"Loads of, ummmm, fun......",1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,1847,"['borrowed', 'film', 'friend', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'end', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'had', 'placed', 'popcorn', 'back', 'end', 'table', 'cleaned', 'hands', 'so', 'not', 'butter', 'up', 'rewind', 'button', 'remote', 'was', 'totally', 'taken', 'off', 'guard', 'pleasant', 'way', 'liked', 'movie', 'several', 'different', 'reasons.First', 'Shortbus', 'pushed', 'edge', 'terms', 'sexual', 'content', 'movie', 'straight', 'gay', 'sex', 'scenes', 'something', 'interest', 'just', 'everyone', 'many', 'scenes', 'occur', 'group', 'setting', 'types', 'people', 'varying', 'orientations', 'taking', 'part', 'appreciated', 'inclusive', 'nature', 'film', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'are', 'done', 'artistic', 'tone.The', 'movie', 'also', 'touches', 'other', 'issues', 'sex', 'such', 'depression', 'suicide', 'intricate', 'nature', 'philosophy', 'romantic', 'love', 'promiscuity', 'machinations', 'female', 'anatomy/orgasm', 'importance', 'being', 'societal', 'pressures', 'might', 'abound', 'friendship', 'compassion', 'most', 'solidarity', 'world', 'unknowns.Shortbus', 'very', 'special', 'place', 'place', 'where', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'go', 'feel', 'welcomed', 'are', 'straight', 'gay', 'thin', 'large', 'beautiful', 'not-so-beautiful', 'introvert', 'extrovert', 'young', 'old', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'other', 'designations', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'not', 'matter', 'Shortbus', 'place', 'commune', 'others', 'share', 'would', 'like', 'share.For', 'Shortbus', 'metaphor', 'what', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'less', 'judgemental', 'little', 'more', 'accepting', 'compassionate', 'empathetic', 'place', 'could', 'identify', 'would', 'only', 'let', 'go', 'things', 'bind', 'misconceptions', 'anachronisms', '..']",Shortbus

""Shortbus"" (2006) differs from ""Hedwig"" greatly in a number of ways.  Unlike ""Hedwig,"" ""Shortbus"" shows the perspective of numerous people instead of one major character, it is less campy and it isn't a musical. However, in some ways ""Hedwig"" and ""Shortbus"" are cut from the same cloth in that both are films about self-discovery, unrequited love and sexuality.The film tells the story of several unfulfilled people--Sofia (a couple's therapist) who can't reach orgasm with her husband Rob, James and Jamie, (a gay couple who's relationship has stagnated) their new lover Ceth, Celab, a voyeur of James and Jamie,  Sofia's new dominatrix friend Severin and the drag queen host of the club Shortbus, where the characters congregate.Throughout the course of the film we see the lives of these characters unfold and cross paths, as they look into their lives and ask why they are unhappy and what they can do to find fulfillment. Although there is a lot of graphic sex depicted in this film, it's not really pornography, as its purpose is not to sexually arouse the audience. I think film critic Roger Ebert best articulated the point of the film by noting that it is ""not about sex, but about sexuality, not about scoring, but about living.""I really, really enjoyed this film. All of the characters were sympathetic and intriguing. And just when you thought that you had someone figured out, they would do or say something that you didn't quite expect, taking the viewer for a ride and throwing some curve-balls.  ""Shortbus"" may shock you a little, but more importantly it will make you think, as well as laugh and smile a little along the way.",5,A Great follow-up to Hedwig,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,1774,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', '2001', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'follow', 'up', 'Shortbus', '2006', 'differs', 'Hedwig', 'greatly', 'number', 'ways', 'Hedwig', 'Shortbus', 'perspective', 'numerous', 'people', 'instead', 'one', 'major', 'character', 'less', 'campy', ""n't"", 'musical', 'However', 'ways', 'Hedwig', 'Shortbus', 'are', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', 'are', 'films', 'self-discovery', 'unrequited', 'love', 'sexuality.The', 'film', 'story', 'several', 'unfulfilled', 'people', 'Sofia', 'couple', 'therapist', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reach', 'orgasm', 'husband', 'Rob', 'James', 'Jamie', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'relationship', 'stagnated', 'new', 'lover', 'Ceth', 'Celab', 'voyeur', 'James', 'Jamie', 'Sofia', 'new', 'dominatrix', 'friend', 'Severin', 'drag', 'queen', 'host', 'club', 'Shortbus', 'where', 'characters', 'congregate.Throughout', 'course', 'film', 'see', 'lives', 'characters', 'unfold', 'cross', 'paths', 'look', 'lives', 'ask', 'why', 'are', 'unhappy', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'find', 'fulfillment', 'lot', 'graphic', 'sex', 'depicted', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'pornography', 'purpose', 'not', 'sexually', 'arouse', 'audience', 'think', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'best', 'articulated', 'point', 'film', 'noting', 'not', 'sex', 'sexuality', 'not', 'scoring', 'living', 'really', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'characters', 'were', 'sympathetic', 'intriguing', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'had', 'someone', 'figured', 'out', 'would', 'do', 'say', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'expect', 'taking', 'viewer', 'ride', 'throwing', 'curve-balls', 'Shortbus', 'may', 'shock', 'little', 'more', 'importantly', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'laugh', 'smile', 'little', 'way']",Shortbus

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","For those of you (and there may be some) concerned that, in a post-HIV world the Underground has diminished into historical insignificance, SHORTBUS serves notice the Counterculture is still here, and is eccentric as ever.  Shortbus is the name of a New York underground sex club, where uninhibited, hedonistic patrons flock for group sex, indie music, and ostentatious camaraderie.  No, it's not an establishment to host a church social, but it is a place where those who wish to think outside the box gather to learn more about themselves.The varied regulars of Shortbus include a gay couple, a sex therapist, and a dominatrix; these characters spin the interdependent story threads of the film.  Although there's some quirky humor to be found in several scenes and in all of the characters, there is also a dark undertow--an almost pessimistic searching of self, of discovering shortcomings and ultimate disappointments.  Which is why SHORTBUS is almost too clever for its own good, and why the film is decidedly uneven.  Case in point:  the gay plot thread was overly corny and melodramatic, not fully vetted or resolved, with one of the characters repeatedly bursting into tears light years beyond the patience of this reviewer.That said, there are some distinct positives about SHORTBUS.  All of the acting was very good, particularly Sook-Yin Lee (who I learned from the special features is a CBC broadcaster), playing a sex therapist who, irony of ironies, is in search of that elusive first orgasm.  The majority of character interaction was improvised, and improvised convincingly.  I like diverse characters, so here's a film that satisfies that requirement in spades.Oh yeah.  There's also this matter of sex.  I won't sugarcoat it:  This is a graphic film using human sexuality as its driving metaphor.  There is gay sex, there is straight sex, there is group sex, there are deviations thereof; so if any (or all) of the above offend thee, do not watch SHORTBUS.  As director John Cameron Mitchell explains via the special features (which I heartily recommend), the graphic sex to begin the movie serves the purpose to ""burst the audience's hymen""--a prurient hook, so to speak.  The intensity of the sex is subsequently diminished as the film moves along.The commentary featuring Mitchell and several of the actors is very informative and revealing--especially when it comes to the particulars surrounding the final camera shot of the film.

And some part of me wondered ... did John Cameron Mitchell even bother to submit this to the MPAA? Not, of course, because he expected to receive a ""passing-grade"" from the prudish parents (and the two members of the clergy) that run the ratings and appeals board ... but simply to force the cloistered collection of puritans to watch couples attempting to negotiate their sexuality.The fantastic ensemble cast is phenomenal at arousing laughter, compassion, and perhaps a few tears. Moreover, in a weird way, watching Sofia navigate the Shortbus haven is kind of like a return to high-school parties: everyone is making out, someone is crying in the closet, a couple of people are watching television, a group of desperate goofs are playing ""spin the bottle,"" and your boyfriend (or girlfriend) is bored. Ohh, and you never leave very satisfied:)What surprised me was how this film could have been painfully predictable, but was not. For instance, in the film's introduction, Sophia expresses that she has never climaxed with her husband. When she explores Shortbus, she meets Severin (a tortured dominatrix). When the two women bond and become intimate, the viewer is convinced that satisfaction will come from another woman. Not so (thank goodness!). In fact, she is betrayed by Severin's greedy lust. This is an unexpected, painful, and realistic turn for the film. I applaud the fact the Mitchell complicates sex ... there are no easy answers for Mitchell (Thank you!!)Unlike some of the reviewers here, I do not think ""less is more."" We have lived with ""less is more"" for way too long. We Americans think sex is shameful ... and if any films include it, they better be hidden in back rooms ... behind ugly beaded curtains. These films invariably degrade both sexes and they degrade sex itself. This film shows Americans loving-couples (in many cases real-life couples) engaging in consensual sex. It illustrates the complications and beauty of these relationships. Never does it condescend. Instead, it graceful allows its viewers to become welcomed voyeurs ... we learn as we watch. We experience the joy and frustration of these characters. It is ... quite marvelous.If you are tired of films that ignore the pleasures of sex for women (ignore, or as we learn from ""This Film is Not Yet Rated,"" simply are not permitted to show WOMEN enjoying sex), if you are searching for a film which treats the sex-life of gay men with playfulness and respect, if you are desperate for a film which makes sex ""sexy,"" messy, and complicated, then give Shortbus your attention.But if films with gay men pleasuring each other and women finding pleasure at all, turn you off ... well, you may as well return to the area behind the beaded curtain. The rest of us will hope that Mitchell continues to build upon his ground-breaking works!Thank you, Mr. Mitchell!",5,"""You've got to pull the bus over . . . You're not riding safely . . .

It is the film like nothing I've seen before and I've seen many films. It should be named Real Sex and the City or Every Thing You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask had not the latter title been taken already by Woody Allen. Actually you don't have to ask anything - you will get more information and graphic answers that you ever would hope for. This is the film where the graphical sex scenes are in abundance, they are extremely explicit. John Cameron Mitchell means business, and he gets down to it. By his own words,""In the old days, when you couldn't show sex on film, directors like Hitchcock had metaphors for sex (trains going into tunnels, etc). When you can show more realistic sex, the sex itself can be a metaphor for other parts of the character's lives. The way people express themselves sexually can tell you a lot about who they are. Some people ask me, ""couldn't you have told the same story without the explicitness?"" They don't ask whether I could've done Hedwig without the songs. Why not be allowed to use every paint in the paint box?"" John Cameron MitchellBut after the initial shock, you realize that there are ideas, feelings, the attempt to understand the important things - what do we want? What is sex for us? How to understand ourselves first of all, how to communicate your desires, how to fulfill them? Shortbus is totally honest; it does care about its characters, and tells their stories of struggling with all sorts of existential difficulties, sexual or not, without condescending, with the equal dozes of sweetness, wit, and understanding. The film was made by a talented filmmaker. The beginning scenes would certainly grab your attention while introducing a viewer to few New Yorkers whose lives will be intertwined later. The music score and the songs are nice and set a melancholic mood, they provide a welcomed rest for the passengers on the Shortbus. The cast that consists mainly of non-professional first time performers, did a convincing job. It is not porn, it is an independent dramedy that uses sex scenes to answer many questions about life.The DVD includes the documentary Gifted and Challenged: The Making of 'Shortbus'.

Frank Ripploh, for example, shocked the hell out of audiences in 1980 when he did exactly that in the German art-house favorite TAXI ZUM KLO.  Even so, thirty years later it isn't exactly the norm, so I came to SHORTBUS with considerably curiosity ... and discovered the movie wasn't what I expected it to be at all.In some respects, SHORTBUS is what you might expect if Robert Altman directed such a film--it has a very mosaic-like quality and an open-ended conclusion.  Even so, there is a central plot.  Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee) is a sex-therapist who has been faking orgasms with her husband all these years.  Indeed, she's never had one at all.  Her frustrations explode when she is visited by two gay men, James and Jamie (Paul Dawson and PJ DeBoy), who are debating whether or not to have an open relationship; in frustration with Jamie's superficial attitudes she slaps him and then must explain herself.  When she does so, they invite her join her at Shortbus, a sort of salon where members do everything from drugs to performance art to sex.At this point the story takes off in two different directions, one focused on Sofia as she goes in search of an orgasm and one focused on the secretly suicidal James as he works to find a replacement for himself to live with Jamie after he is dead.  Sofia meets and becomes involved with a dominatrix named Severin (Lindsay Beamish); James and Jamie become involved first with Ceth (Jay Brennan) and then later with Caleb (Peter Stickles.)  Along the way the various characters admit to a series of personal issues ranging from past abuse to depression to inadequacy.  One way or another, all of them struggle to feel they belong, and that struggle generally involves sex.  And make no mistake, SHORTBUS is crammed with explicit sex, including penetration, oral sex, and ejaculation.If this sounds dark, it isn't.  If anything, SHORTBUS is a fairytale painted in attractive, glossy colors, and although it has any number of touching moments, it is actually very, very funny.  But my criticism of the film is that it is too attractive, too glossy, too touching, too funny.  There's not much in the way of genuine grit or even any degree of reality, and the story and characters give up all their secrets in a single viewing.

1037631,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000LAZDQA,Grady Harp,"[5, 7]","Finally there is a film that rises to the intelligent choices of European cinema!  In a giant leap forward John Cameron Mitchell has broken the taboo of frankly cinematically captured sexuality that has so long embarrassed American filmmakers.  What he has created in this important experimental film SHORTBUS is not only a fascinating probe into the complexities of contemporary sexuality but also a group of relationship stories that stand on terra firma and are not merely a matrix for the frank sexuality from which they are derived.John Cameron Mitchell visits the relationships of several couples: a Canadian Chinese couples therapist/sex therapist (Sook-Yin Lee) who describes herself as ""pre-orgasmic - she has never had an orgasm - married to a stay at home man (Raphael Barker): a young gay couple Jamie (PJ DeBoy) and James (Paul Dawson) who are considering opening up their monogamous relationship; a Dominatrix (Lindsay Beamish) and her long time male client among others.  The location is New York City and in this melting pot is a club called 'Shortbus' where all manner of people visit to observe and participate in orgiastic activities, all with the goal of improving their libidinous experiences and heightening their pleasure zones  And it is in this club that each of the couples meet and interface and change and grow.The film shows just about every form of sexual activity, none of it hidden from the camera at all.  Mitchell has the courage and skill to draw from a cast of unknowns some particularly strong characters and he is able to show full frontal tumescent men and uninhibited women like no other American filmmaker has dared.  The rewarding aspect is that Mitchell has finally succeeded in making a quality film for the open minded intelligent public who will not shy away in puritanical fright.  Mitchell's first film was 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' which has become a cult favorite. With SHORTBUS he steps further into the arena of successful American experimental cinema with a courageous and wholly enjoyable little work of art.  He is a standard bearer and hopefully will open the gates for other directors to bury the fear of filming the sexual being - especially the ages long phobia of male frontal nudity!

1037632,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000LAZDQA,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[9, 11]","""Shortbus"" deals with many of the same issues as ""Hedwig"" and the ""Angry Inch,"" but in a new and equally groundbreaking way. Yes, there is hardcore sex, and honestly, there should have been even more, it is used as another layer of paint on one of the most poignant canvases I have seen in years. This film is part of a new breed of cinema that dares to force actors to cross over the line from acting in a film and portraying a fictional character to actually being a subject in a documentary: the once strict line that distinguishes where a character begins and an actor ends has become totally blurred and is no longer recognizable for the actors or rather beautiful and real human beings who appear on screen in this film.As much as this film is about its characters and their lives, it is about the state of underground or lack of underground art and culture in New York City, particularly the lower east side art scene - a nostalgic yearning for a time and an age of culture and community that is sadly gone in present day Manhattan. Theoretically, ""Shortbus"" forces us to question the nature of the spectator in a movie theater, watching a TV screen or computer monitor, or looking through the viewfinder of a camera. It is rare for any film these days to ask and provoke the kind of emotional responses and questions about the nature of spectatorship, voyeurism, censorship, viewership, and pornography while at the same time pushing the boundaries of cinema, redefining cinematic, and fusing multiple aesthetic systems that ""Shortbus"" does in under two hours. The actors were earnest in their efforts (and brave to perform the sex scenes), although no Oscar-winning performances I'd say. I did find Paul Dawson to be quite effective in his ability to convey emotion, esp. in the scene where he's looking out the window at PJ DeBoy. Despite not speaking or moving, we can feel his emotion.A note about the ending without ruining anything: many people that will balk at it for not being realistic or digging deep enough or as deep as the rest of the film may be missing part of the point. The whimsical CGI animation used throughout the film should immediately tip you off to the fact that there is a magical fantasy element present in the storyline that is represented by ""Shortbus"" itself. This when combined with the nostalgic seedy underground art scene depicted in the film causes one to realize that the ending and resolution of each character's issues is in fact a just a continuation of that nostalgic fantasy for the bygone lower Manhattan cabaret scene, and thus adds another bitter sweet layer to the film. We can already guess the brutal reality of what will happen to each set of characters and their relationships in the film, but that doesn't mean it is what has to happen on screen. What happens inside ""Shortbus"" is a hopeful and optimistic fantasy set in a burlesque and erotic theatre of the absurd, what happens outside is our hardboiled reality.If you cannot find yourself somewhere in this film, somewhere in the mythical ""Shortbus,"" you might not actually exist.",4,That's another interesting way on seeing the Star Spangled Banner performed.,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,3092,"['Shortbus', 'deals', 'many', 'same', 'issues', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'new', 'equally', 'groundbreaking', 'way', 'Yes', 'hardcore', 'sex', 'honestly', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'used', 'layer', 'paint', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'canvases', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'film', 'part', 'new', 'breed', 'cinema', 'force', 'actors', 'cross', 'line', 'acting', 'film', 'portraying', 'fictional', 'character', 'actually', 'being', 'subject', 'documentary', 'once', 'strict', 'line', 'where', 'character', 'actor', 'become', 'totally', 'blurred', 'longer', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'rather', 'beautiful', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'appear', 'screen', 'film.As', 'much', 'film', 'characters', 'lives', 'state', 'underground', 'lack', 'underground', 'art', 'culture', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'particularly', 'lower', 'east', 'side', 'art', 'scene', 'nostalgic', 'yearning', 'time', 'age', 'culture', 'community', 'sadly', 'gone', 'present', 'day', 'Manhattan', 'Theoretically', 'Shortbus', 'forces', 'question', 'nature', 'spectator', 'movie', 'theater', 'watching', 'TV', 'screen', 'computer', 'monitor', 'looking', 'viewfinder', 'camera', 'rare', 'film', 'days', 'ask', 'provoke', 'kind', 'emotional', 'responses', 'questions', 'nature', 'spectatorship', 'voyeurism', 'censorship', 'viewership', 'pornography', 'same', 'time', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'cinema', 'redefining', 'cinematic', 'fusing', 'multiple', 'aesthetic', 'systems', 'Shortbus', 'two', 'hours', 'actors', 'were', 'earnest', 'efforts', 'brave', 'perform', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Oscar-winning', 'performances', ""'d"", 'say', 'did', 'find', 'Paul', 'Dawson', 'be', 'quite', 'effective', 'ability', 'convey', 'emotion', 'esp', 'scene', 'where', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'PJ', 'DeBoy', 'not', 'speaking', 'moving', 'can', 'feel', 'emotion.A', 'note', 'ending', 'ruining', 'anything', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'balk', 'not', 'being', 'realistic', 'digging', 'deep', 'enough', 'as', 'deep', 'rest', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'missing', 'part', 'point', 'whimsical', 'CGI', 'animation', 'used', 'film', 'should', 'immediately', 'tip', 'off', 'fact', 'magical', 'fantasy', 'element', 'present', 'storyline', 'represented', 'Shortbus', 'when', 'combined', 'nostalgic', 'seedy', 'underground', 'art', 'scene', 'depicted', 'film', 'one', 'realize', 'ending', 'resolution', 'character', 'issues', 'fact', 'just', 'continuation', 'nostalgic', 'fantasy', 'bygone', 'lower', 'Manhattan', 'cabaret', 'scene', 'thus', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'layer', 'film', 'can', 'already', 'guess', 'brutal', 'reality', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'set', 'characters', 'relationships', 'film', ""n't"", 'mean', 'what', 'happen', 'screen', 'What', 'Shortbus', 'hopeful', 'optimistic', 'fantasy', 'set', 'burlesque', 'erotic', 'theatre', 'absurd', 'what', 'outside', 'hardboiled', 'reality.If', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'somewhere', 'film', 'somewhere', 'mythical', 'Shortbus', 'might', 'not', 'actually', 'exist']",Shortbus

1037635,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B000LAZDQA,J. Martin,"[0, 1]","John Cameron Mitchell's first movie, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, is one of the most original, interesting, and entertaining movies I've ever seen, so I expected to like Shortbus, his second movie. It pains me to say that I don't. I wanted to, I tried hard to, but I don't. Maybe because of Hedwig my expectations were too high.I just don't understand Shortbus at all. I never understood Hedwig either, although I saw it six or seven times live in New York and dozens of times on film and DVD, but not understanding Hedwig didn't keep me from loving it. Maybe if I'd ever really understood Hedwig I might understand and appreciate Shortbus too. I didn't, so I don't know. Paraphrasing Hedwig, I don't have much to work with.Somewhere in the Shortbus DVD extras, Mitchell said he wanted to do with sex in Shortbus what he did with music in Hedwig. That implies that the two movies might be fundamentally similar but using different media: music in Hedwig, sex in Shortbus. Okay.So, since I don't understand either movie, the difference for me comes down to the difference in media. The problem is that Stephen Trask's music for Hedwig was brilliant, moving, and exhilarating, but the sex in Shortbus is just boring. Mechanical, uninspired and uninspiring, tedious. Like watching robots have sex. Maybe that's how Mitchell meant it to be, maybe he's trying to make some point that I just don't get, but the bottom line for me is it just doesn't make a good movie.I have to say, though, there is one very, very good five-minute scene in Shortbus. It's when the characters played by Paul Dawson and Lindsay Beamish are locked together in a closet during a game of Truth or Dare. That scene is sweet, moving, perfectly constructed and paced and infinitely accessible. I can watch it over and over and over and never get tired of it at all. If the whole movie had been half as good as that scene is, I'd be raving about it and wanting more than five stars to give it, but it's not.Also on the positive side, Jay Brannan is luminous in his few scenes (and in the DVD outtake called ""Are you sure you don't want to **** me?""). Unfortunately, his best scenes in the movie are shared with the unwatchably creepy, lizard-like mayor played by Alan Mandell (and it's not because he's old).And talk about creepy, I don't understand what anybody sees in Justin Bond. He may be a delightful person when he's at home, but listening to his whiny, grating voice drawl out that awful, interminable musical number ""In the End,"" which bloats out the last four hours (it seems like) of the movie, that's like water torture!So, even though I'm seriously disappointed in Shortbus, I'm giving it two stars: one for Dawson, Beamish, and Brannan; and the other for Hedwig, who may be lurking somewhere in Shortbus and I just haven't found her yet. I intend to keep looking.",2,I loved Hedwig.

1037637,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000LAZDQA,Jonathan Appleseed,"[30, 37]","The reviews for this film are almost as entertaining to read and ingest as the movie itself. That may or not be a good thing. For example, here on Amazon, Shortbus is averaging 4 stars as of this writing. On pro.imdb, it has a respectable 7.2/10 score from viewers. On Metacritic.com, the average critic rating is 64 (65 on RottenTomatoes.com), while the average user rating is 8.7/10. A conspicuous variance.I rented the movie for two reasons: 1) I find thatHedwig and the Angry Inchis not only a brilliant film, but it is also one of my top-10 favorites ""of all time"" and have been waiting for John Cameron Mitchell to come out with something new for a while, and 2) to be embarrassingly honest, to satisfy a carnal curiosity.Shortbus is a film focused on relationships and inner demons, and sex seems to have come along for the ride. In the opening scenes, we are witness to the most vivid sex I've ever seen on film that hasn't been classified as pornography, and these scenes were far ""harder"" than any soft core porn I've ever seen and in some cases better than the hard stuff, undoubtedly because this had the distinct stamp of feeling real. There's a young man auto-fellating (James, played by Paul Dawson), a ""trust fund Muppet"" and a Mistress (Justin Bond playing himself and Lindsay Beamish as Severin), and a heterosexual couple (Sook-Yin Lee as Sofia and Raphael Barker as Rob). Sofia and Rob have the most straightforward sex - pun intended? - as the first two scenes are more exploratory in theme and content. All end in shattering climaxes; indeed, James cries when he is finished; Justin hits the wall, so to speak, while Severin looks on, stunned; and Sofia finds her way to a rather convulsive end.Frankly, it was all rather steamy, and I wish I'd seen it in the theater, if only to look around and watch people squirm in their seats.And then we get to the meat of the matter. James's and his boyfriend Jamie see a sex therapist - Sofia - who prefers to be called a couples counselor. Their intention is to open up the relationship. As they talk, it's obvious to the viewer, and to Sofia, that Jamie has no life outside of James, and that the two appear to have very different agendas. She sends Jamie out of the room to talk to James alone, and after that, talks to Jamie alone. When you compare the Jamie that spoke to Sofia in her office to the Jamie throughout the rest of the film, you see a very different character. The Jamie in Sofia's office is, frankly, an idiot and immensely unlikable. Even Sofia slaps him. The Jamie throughout the rest of the book may be hyper-dependent on James, but he's warm, compassionate, and likeable.We learn that Sofia's slap was not only a reaction to Jamie's personality, but also because she is ""pre-orgasmic"", meaning that she's never had an orgasm. They suggest that she go to a place called Shortbus to help find relief to this.Shortbus (the place, not the film) is a world within a world, with the requisite transvestite caretaker and rooms upon rooms of deviance and compulsion. There is, of course, the large room where everyone is naked and having sex, and other rooms where people hang out with no clear purpose (this is a weakness in its structure). When Sofia enters, she bumps into James and Jamie, who are there to ""work at"" opening up the relationship.Severin is there too, and Sofia meets her as she flees the other rooms - too many men. They develop a friendship, and decide to help each other: Sofia will help Severin try to open herself up to having a more meaningful relationship than what she has with her johns, and Severin will try to help Sofia reach orgasm. It's not at all clear what qualifies Severin to help with this, and it's not even particularly clear why Sofia contacted Severin outside of Shortbus to be friends.James and Jamie find their third: Ceth (pronounced Seth), and we're treated to yet more sex. In an hysterical but somewhat uncomfortable moment, Jamie sings the Star Spangled Banner while, um, using Ceth's behind as a megaphone. Stranger yet, Ceth says that it wasn't the first time that's happened. The three do look very comfortable together.With all the pieces in place, the story begins to dramatize, and moves from the light hearted sexy romp into a darker place of inner demons. It's far less successful when the lights go out - and I mean this both figuratively and literally, as the story is set against a backdrop of increasing brownouts that eventually lead to a blackout.Every character is beset with demons, but none more so than James is. And somehow, in the end, they all achieve resolution. What I'm uncomfortable with is *how* they reached resolution, because what was presented didn't make an ounce of sense to me. It appears that sex opened doors for everyone to delve deeper inside, but here's a huge problem: with the singular exception of James, we have no idea what anyone's inner demons are. If we don't know what they are, how can we accept any form of resolution for them? And while we do learn of James's demons, his epiphany (or what he did to reach that epiphany) made no sense at all and was utterly unbelievable.The movie was loosely scripted, and it grew in the telling with the actors ad-libbed input. I might have guessed that fact if the film didn't tell us, because (as I illustrated with Jamie above) characters sometimes went against what I felt their core-values were, at least as they were established in the beginning segments of the film. It's a great concept, but without continuity, believability suffers.I'm on the fence with this. I'm tempted to give it two stars for a story that meandered and fell apart at the end, but they have to get credit for filming so much sex while none of it was gratuitous. At no time did the sexual situations ever seem overdone or out of place. That's one heck of an accomplishment, given how much flesh was shown. And there was a LOT of flesh. Men were erect and they climaxed - and we saw the result of their climax. We saw Sofia madly at work trying to give herself the big O, and were given, more than once, a very clear picture of her ""sex"". (I don't know how else to say it and escape Amazon's censors.3 stars for their accomplishment...",3,A weak story saved by the lack of - believe it or not - gratuitous sex,1175212800,"03 30,

You get all the things Altman gave us in films like ""Nashville"" and ""Short Cuts"": lots of characters, lots of situations, a lot of sadness, but a lot of hope, too.  Of course, here you also get lots of sex, in a very graphic manner and in all its various permutations.  If you can take that, and if you don't mind a film that doesn't offer easy answers to its many characters' many predicaments, I think you'll enjoy this movie, or at least find it fascinating.By the way, if some of the sex scenes overwhelm you, be sure to watch the special features.  You'll be reassured to see that the challenge of those scenes overwhelmed, at least temporarily, many of the actors called on to perform them.  For some reason, it was good to see that hip young people up for being in an edgy, sexy movie could nevertheless feel a little shy when it came to actually doing certain things in front of the camera.

1037640,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000LAZDQA,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 7]","I started hearing about ""Shortbus"" quite a few years ago (maybe 5) and didn't think much of it. It's, essentially, a movie that will be seen less than the average porno that has a bunch of non-actors having real sex. Before this movie debuted, another movie called ""9 Songs"" came out. This was about a couple, non-actors, who went to concerts and had real sex. That's it. It was bashed deservedly and I expected the same for Shortbus. Oddly enough, this film got fairly good reviews and continues to get praise right here on Amazon. The movie is written and directed (although the cast is responsible for the storylines) by John Cameron Mitchell, who is probably most famous for writing, directing, and starring in ""Hedwig & the Angry Inch,"" which is one of my least favorite films of all time. ""Shortbus"" contains some of the same visuals that makes a lot of people like that film, but has even more homosexual content. I don't want to sound like a perv, but I rented this movie because I heard it had graphic sex and I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. The first 5 minutes of the film is nothing but graphic sex and some of it is a bit disturbing. What the character James does is highly unlikely. The film just weaves through various relationships (the title comes from the name of a sex club they all attend). For a quick synopsis: There's James and Jamie, a gay couple going through a rough patch in their relationship. There's Sofia and Rob, a married couple also hitting a rough patch. Sofia, a sex therapist, is unable to experience an orgasm. Then there's the dominatrix Severin, trying to find meaningful communication with someone. Ceth, a gay frequenter of Shortbus, who is one of the most annoying people I have ever had to watch act. There's also a stalker, who watches James from across the street in his high-rise apartment. The film is, without a doubt, realistic for the most part. It's massively better than the aforementioned ""9 Songs,"" but it's not a very good movie as a whole. It's kind of disturbing, but don't get me wrong...It's not porn, nor erotica. The way the film deals with relationships is realistic and some of the sex seems realistic (it is real, just more movie-like than one would expect)...As for the end of the film and many other scenes, it's a bit pretentious. The ending especially, which is both annoying and completely unrealistic...But look, I'm one of the only reviewers on here mentioning this stuff about the movie. I don't know what kind of audience to recommend this too, so I'm just stating my opinion and leaving the decision to you. I just, personally, didn't think it was a great film and I will not be watching it again.GRADE: C-",3,Very Overrated,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,2698,"['started', 'hearing', 'Shortbus', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'maybe', '5', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'essentially', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'less', 'average', 'porno', 'bunch', 'non-actors', 'having', 'real', 'sex', 'movie', 'debuted', 'movie', 'called', '9', 'Songs', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'couple', 'non-actors', 'who', 'went', 'concerts', 'had', 'real', 'sex', 'was', 'bashed', 'deservedly', 'expected', 'same', 'Shortbus', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'film', 'got', 'fairly', 'good', 'reviews', 'get', 'praise', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'cast', 'responsible', 'storylines', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'writing', 'directing', 'starring', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'Shortbus', 'same', 'visuals', 'lot', 'people', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'homosexual', 'content', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', 'perv', 'rented', 'movie', 'heard', 'had', 'graphic', 'sex', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'film', 'nothing', 'graphic', 'sex', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'What', 'character', 'James', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'film', 'just', 'through', 'various', 'relationships', 'title', 'name', 'sex', 'club', 'attend', 'quick', 'synopsis', 'James', 'Jamie', 'gay', 'couple', 'going', 'rough', 'patch', 'relationship', 'Sofia', 'Rob', 'married', 'couple', 'also', 'hitting', 'rough', 'patch', 'Sofia', 'sex', 'therapist', 'unable', 'experience', 'orgasm', 'Then', 'dominatrix', 'Severin', 'trying', 'find', 'meaningful', 'communication', 'someone', 'Ceth', 'gay', 'frequenter', 'Shortbus', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'people', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'watch', 'act', 'also', 'stalker', 'who', 'James', 'street', 'high-rise', 'apartment', 'film', 'doubt', 'realistic', 'most', 'part', 'massively', 'better', 'aforementioned', '9', 'Songs', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'whole', 'kind', 'disturbing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'porn', 'erotica', 'way', 'film', 'deals', 'relationships', 'realistic', 'sex', 'realistic', 'real', 'just', 'more', 'movie-like', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'end', 'film', 'many', 'other', 'scenes', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'ending', 'especially', 'annoying', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'look', ""'m"", 'one', 'only', 'reviewers', 'here', 'mentioning', 'stuff', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'audience', 'recommend', 'too', ""'m"", 'just', 'stating', 'opinion', 'leaving', 'decision', 'just', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'watching', 'again.GRADE', 'C-']",Shortbus

But this Little Movie that Could did something much more amazing, it reached right out there and touched folks.  Some it touched in the gut.  Some ran from the theatre, demanding their money back.  Some laughed at the silly parts.  Some laughed at the sad parts.But for those of us who it was designed for, it did something really amazing, it helped remind us that 9/11 didn't destroy us. It helped us recall the '60's (but as one character so wisely points out, without as much hope).Though there is hope, and joy, and laughter, and more actual sex (gay and straight) than any other movie you've seen without a second of porn in it.  All this, and a triumph of the human spirit.My best friend went with me to see this film primarily because he'd really loved HaTAI.  He is a straight guy, he saw way more mano-a-mano love-makin' than he'd ever seen in his life, yet he was the one saying at the end how we needed to see it again, and soon.  So we went again.Sure, the whole thing revolves around a woman who is unable to find her Big 'O'.  But it is essentially about how all the folks in this film are unable to connect.  It is like their lives are happening around them, but they can't really feel them, can't really let anyone know what they really need.And in the end, they all get it.So will you if you take a chance on this great little film.Great music.

I'm not sure what they (or any of us, for that matter) mean by ""pornography,"" but I suspect that people who apply the word to ""Shortbus"" intend it as a synonym for ""sex.""  There's lots of sex in ""Shortbus,"" but it's sex that's celebratory, fun, funny, poignant, self-revealing, and loving.Humans are sexual creatures, and our sexuality is irreducibly connected to our personal identities, our ability to love (as well as our ability to hate), and our need for companionship as social animals.  In ""Shortbus,"" the complexity of sexuality is explored through several interrelated story lines:  Sophia's (masterfully played by Sook-Yin Lee) search for satisfaction, Jamie's (P.J. DeBoy) and James' (Paul Dawson) almost tragic but ultimately fruitful love for one another, Severin's (Lindsay Beamish) fear of intimacy, and drag performance artist Justin Bond's wonderfully exuberant celebration of human love in all its manifestations.  One particularly touching scene is an encounter between an ""ex-mayor of NYC,"" a gay, thinly disguised Koch, who reflects on loneliness, aging, and AIDS.The film's dialogue is witty at times, poignant at others.

The hype is true--there's hardcore sex, and lots of it, in this loose, improvisatory chronicle of several New Yorkers and their uncertain journeys through life. The bulk of what narrative there is centers around Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee), a sex therapist who's never had an orgasm despite an ostensibly happy marriage, and Jamie and James (P J Deboy and Paul Dawson), a gay couple considering opening their relationship, who are secretly being stalked by their neighbor (Peter Stickles). They and several of their friends end up at Shortbus, which seems to be part nightclub, part sex club and part political discussion group. At first it's hard not to be caught up in the prurient thrill of seeing these people actually perform THOSE acts on film, but unlike hardcore pornography, where sex quickly palls due to its pointlessness, the sex in ""Shortbus"" enthralls because there is always an emotional purpose to it--these characters are doing it for a reason. Hence they earn the viewer's empathy and sympathy. As subversive in their way are scenes where a group of women talk about their best orgasms, or where a young gay man (the unbelievably beautiful Jay Brannan) has a conversation with the aged, wrinkled former Mayor of New York, totally as equals. The film does falter somewhat toward the end and the conflicts are resolved a mite hurriedly, but the overall impression remains. In an age where mainstream community standards do their best to suppress the sight of adults having consensual, joyful, and even funny sex, while condoning the ever more explicit depiction of all kinds of violence against the human body, ""Shortbus"" is a vivid protest against such topsy-turvy hypocrisy. The DVD includes a fascinating half-hour documentary narrated by Mitchell about the unusual creation process of ""Shortbus,"" a must-see. The rest can be dispensed with, although watching deleted scenes involving Stickles' character in an overtly political subplot confirms the filmmakers' ultimate decision to omit them.",5,"Not for children, but a must for thinking adults",1186444800,"08 7, 2007",2007,2151,"['John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'gave', 'audiences', 'striking', 'gender-bending', 'musical', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'boundaries', 'again', 'Shortbus', 'hype', 'true', 'hardcore', 'sex', 'lots', 'loose', 'improvisatory', 'chronicle', 'several', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'uncertain', 'journeys', 'life', 'bulk', 'what', 'narrative', 'centers', 'Sofia', 'Sook-Yin', 'Lee', 'sex', 'therapist', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'orgasm', 'ostensibly', 'happy', 'marriage', 'Jamie', 'James', 'P', 'J', 'Deboy', 'Paul', 'Dawson', 'gay', 'couple', 'considering', 'opening', 'relationship', 'who', 'are', 'secretly', 'being', 'stalked', 'neighbor', 'Peter', 'Stickles', 'several', 'friends', 'end', 'up', 'Shortbus', 'be', 'part', 'nightclub', 'part', 'sex', 'club', 'part', 'political', 'discussion', 'group', 'first', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'prurient', 'thrill', 'seeing', 'people', 'actually', 'perform', 'THOSE', 'acts', 'film', 'hardcore', 'pornography', 'where', 'sex', 'quickly', 'palls', 'due', 'pointlessness', 'sex', 'Shortbus', 'always', 'emotional', 'purpose', 'characters', 'are', 'doing', 'reason', 'Hence', 'earn', 'viewer', 'empathy', 'sympathy', 'subversive', 'way', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'group', 'women', 'talk', 'best', 'orgasms', 'where', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'unbelievably', 'beautiful', 'Jay', 'Brannan', 'conversation', 'aged', 'wrinkled', 'former', 'Mayor', 'New', 'York', 'totally', 'equals', 'film', 'falter', 'somewhat', 'end', 'conflicts', 'are', 'resolved', 'mite', 'hurriedly', 'overall', 'impression', 'age', 'where', 'mainstream', 'community', 'standards', 'do', 'best', 'suppress', 'sight', 'adults', 'having', 'consensual', 'joyful', 'even', 'funny', 'sex', 'condoning', 'ever', 'more', 'explicit', 'depiction', 'kinds', 'violence', 'human', 'body', 'Shortbus', 'vivid', 'protest', 'such', 'topsy-turvy', 'hypocrisy', 'DVD', 'fascinating', 'half-hour', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Mitchell', 'unusual', 'creation', 'process', 'Shortbus', 'must-see', 'rest', 'can', 'be', 'dispensed', 'watching', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Stickles', 'character', 'overtly', 'political', 'subplot', 'filmmakers', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'omit']",Shortbus
1037644,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,B000LAZDQA,LARRY,"[3, 3]","Oh. My. Goodness!  What an interesting movie that can be visually over-stimulating.  The movie opens with a montage of sex scenes.  You might think that you must've missed the beginning of the movie.  However, you didn't.  Instead, you dived into it.  Maybe Mitchell did it for shock value but the opening scenes were...well...right in your face.  You want to look away but you can't.  You can do nothing but maybe laugh and for some of you...be embarrassed.After the montage, the story begins.  Now, there's so many things going on in this movie.  So, I will just pick 2 groups of people.  One is a gay couple, Jamie and James.  Jamie loves James.  But, James, a former hustler, while he does love Jamie, he feels that he needs more out of life.  Therefore, he suggests that they open up their closed relationship.  Jamie, fearful of losing James, decides couples counseling.Sofia is a couples counselor.  Her speciality is sexual issues.  However, there's one problem.  Sofia has never had an orgasm.  In the initial counseling session with Jamie and James, she breaks down and reveals her sexual shortcoming.So, all three of them go to the Shortbus.  Shortbus is...well, for a lack of a better word, a sort of a bathhouse but with ""class"".  In every rooms in Shortbus, there is a sexual activity going on, whether with a couple or a group.  Not everyone participates nor is everyone pressured to do so.  Some just come to watch.  At Shortbus, Jamie & James and Sofia each encounter people they hope will improve their sexual lives.Love?  Lust?  Which one will win?  Are we all meant to achieve that greatest sexual satisfaction?  You'd be amazed how much sex impacts our daily life.All I can say is ""wow!"" and that you must see it ASAP if you have not seen it yet.  I believe that we, as Americans, are such prudes when it comes to sex and nudity.  In fact, I saw this movie with my partner and 2 friends.

Slaughter ""silvanus""","[2, 2]","Similar in structure to 1992's ""Chain of Desire"", a little-seen film about a circle of New York lovers connected by sexuality, a club scene, and a music score, ( and to a much older film called ""La Ronde""), ""Shortbus"" is upbeat, optimistic, and post-AIDS hysteria (while still being conscious of safe sex) whereas ""Chain of Desire"" hinged on that dark thread connecting its ill-fated characters.  Mitchell's second film is quite mature, and remarkably sweet. It's nice to see a film where people strive towards being conscious and kind; it's also nice to view something where straight, gay and every variation in between mingle with respect and regard to each other without the usual American 'tee-hee-hee' around sex, and money-machine ogres of Falwell and Warren hanging around to cash in and give guilt.Central to the film, and quietly integral, is music from Yo la Tengo, and several songs including ""Upside Down"" and ""Far from the Sea"" and ""Language"" are quite catchy and memorable. These pieces color the film emotionally and supply a pad for the crises depicted amongst its protoganists, played so well by Sook-Yin Lee, Paul Dawson, PJ DeBoy, Julian Bond, and others.  Mitchell has coaxed remarkable performances from actors who also contributed to the script. I found myself quite endeared to them all and wishing I knew them personally.If the low-budget endeavor has any flaws at all, it is Mitchell's sometimes obvious hand at making things fit into the structure, but this is a minor gripe since the film is almost a musical-of-sorts, and one expects some suspension of so-called 'reality'. Moreover, Mitchell is to be commended for his resoluteness is staying with this project for so many years, enlisting so many who believed in it and took career and emotional risks to make it the sweet, non-pornographic experiment that it is.The film does make one pine, in a fashion, for these years between 25-35 if he or she has already passed through them, when clubs are crucial to one's life, when one is so desperately trying to anchor oneself in a meaningful style of living and loving.  I will be anxious to see what kind of Film Mitchell makes about his Forties.Highly recommended. As for the sexuality, well, it's hardly pornographic, except to a sick mind, and handled quite beautifully. And even though the droll, den-mother Julian Bond quips at one point in the film as he watches the rosy-lit orgy with the enchanting Sook-Yin, ""It's like the 60s, darling, but with less hope,"" one senses there is, indeed, hope amongst this generation that plows ahead towards authenticity in the wake of prior generation(s) - some members who survived and many who didn't - who rose above the excreble muck of Anita Bryant, Falwell and the rest who sought to control the bodies -- and minds -- of Americans with fear and shame.",4,"America matures and ""Oh, to live forever on Sugar Mountain""",1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,2828,"['Similar', 'structure', '1992', 'Chain', 'Desire', 'little-seen', 'film', 'circle', 'New', 'York', 'lovers', 'connected', 'sexuality', 'club', 'scene', 'music', 'score', 'much', 'older', 'film', 'called', 'La', 'Ronde', 'Shortbus', 'upbeat', 'optimistic', 'post-AIDS', 'hysteria', 'still', 'being', 'conscious', 'safe', 'sex', 'Chain', 'Desire', 'hinged', 'dark', 'thread', 'connecting', 'ill-fated', 'characters', 'Mitchell', 'second', 'film', 'quite', 'mature', 'remarkably', 'sweet', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'where', 'people', 'strive', 'towards', 'being', 'conscious', 'kind', 'also', 'nice', 'view', 'something', 'where', 'straight', 'gay', 'variation', 'mingle', 'respect', 'regard', 'other', 'usual', 'American', ""'tee-hee-hee"", 'sex', 'money-machine', 'ogres', 'Falwell', 'Warren', 'hanging', 'around', 'cash', 'give', 'guilt.Central', 'film', 'quietly', 'integral', 'music', 'Yo', 'la', 'Tengo', 'several', 'songs', 'including', 'Upside', 'Down', 'Far', 'Sea', 'Language', 'are', 'quite', 'catchy', 'memorable', 'pieces', 'color', 'film', 'emotionally', 'supply', 'pad', 'crises', 'depicted', 'amongst', 'protoganists', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'Sook-Yin', 'Lee', 'Paul', 'Dawson', 'PJ', 'DeBoy', 'Julian', 'Bond', 'others', 'Mitchell', 'coaxed', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'actors', 'who', 'also', 'contributed', 'script', 'found', 'quite', 'endeared', 'wishing', 'knew', 'personally.If', 'low-budget', 'endeavor', 'flaws', 'Mitchell', 'sometimes', 'obvious', 'hand', 'making', 'things', 'fit', 'structure', 'minor', 'gripe', 'film', 'almost', 'musical-of-sorts', 'one', 'suspension', 'so-called', ""'reality"", 'Moreover', 'Mitchell', 'be', 'commended', 'resoluteness', 'staying', 'project', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'enlisting', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'believed', 'took', 'career', 'emotional', 'risks', 'make', 'sweet', 'non-pornographic', 'experiment', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'pine', 'fashion', 'years', '25-35', 'already', 'passed', 'when', 'clubs', 'are', 'crucial', 'one', 'life', 'when', 'one', 'so', 'desperately', 'trying', 'anchor', 'meaningful', 'style', 'living', 'loving', 'will', 'be', 'anxious', 'see', 'what', 'kind', 'Film', 'Mitchell', 'Forties.Highly', 'recommended', 'sexuality', 'well', 'hardly', 'pornographic', 'sick', 'mind', 'handled', 'quite', 'beautifully', 'even', 'droll', 'den-mother', 'Julian', 'Bond', 'quips', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'rosy-lit', 'orgy', 'enchanting', 'Sook-Yin', '60s', 'darling', 'less', 'hope', 'one', 'indeed', 'hope', 'generation', 'ahead', 'towards', 'authenticity', 'wake', 'prior', 'generation', 'members', 'who', 'survived', 'many', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'who', 'rose', 'excreble', 'muck', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'Falwell', 'rest', 'who', 'sought', 'control', 'bodies', 'minds', 'Americans', 'fear', 'shame']",Shortbus

All three hoof it out to Shortbus: a sort of Plato's Retreat in which all manner of sex is performed in every position by every conceivable combination of men and women. Not all participate, no one is pressured, many just watch pretty much as we in the audience are doing: mouths agape, wondering how did Mitchell get the money to make this movie and more to the point: how did he get it released?Justin Bond (played by himself), manager/chorus master/drum majorette of Shortbus describes and dissects the Club's ethos as ""like the 60's but with less hope.""Director John Cameron Mitchell (the brilliant ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") wants to titillate of course but he also wants to illuminate. And most of his characters do come out the backdoor better, smarter more self aware than when they entered. Not everything works.

1037652,A35IW20X5N3CEB,B000LAZDQA,Novelwit2000,"[1, 2]","Right off, I feel like I need to tell anyone who is planning on seeing this film, that it has adult content and situations that most people are not used to seeing in the mainstream cinema.I mean, this film has displays of human interaction that most directors have NEVER filmed in mainstream cinema EVER. So filmgoers PLEASE be warned before you watch!!!Moving on, I'd say this movie is basically about want. There's one character, the character who is a couples counselor, who wants to have an (Oh...I think a LOT of you know what I want to say.) But the thing is, is that this particular character seems to have an 'abundant' relationship with her husband (if you know what I mean), so why she has NEVER had an (Oh...you know what I'm getting at) is BEYOND me?I mean, a better character development for her would've been if she had quite the opposite with her husband. Because to see the two of them go at it--like at the very beginning of the movie, it's kinda shocking (to say the least) that the two of them have NEVER hit pay dirt. I think that for this part of the movie, the screenplay sorta over thunk the wheel.Though nevertheless, this dilemma is the reason we are pretty much introduced to the 'Shortbus' a type of social club where individuals go to meet and experience other people for these particular 'encounters' of...(well, insert adult content here.)I guess this couples counselor feels like this is the ONE place that will help her get to what she's trying to find--even though, given her status as a sex therapist/counselor, you'd think she'd approach this place with a certain amount of suspicion. Though wouldn't she be the eager beaver!Though backing up a little, she finds out about this 'Shortbus' place because of the couple she is currently treating--the two Jamie's--though one of them is now going by the name James.Going back to the theme of want, Jamie just wants to sustain his relationship with James--hence their session with the counselor.The want of James...well, that's a little more complicated because he has these issues that's making him quite depressed--he even takes pills to try to combat this depression. Only he's thinking ahead a bit and not wanting his lover Jamie to be...well, alone, initiates the two of them going to the 'Shortbus' to meet a third person.On the surface, this premise seems quite intriguing--aren't all threesomes supposed to be this way? Only James has a sort of ulterior motive working, because deep down he knows just how depressed he really is and well, because of this depression, he knows how things are probably going to turn out...so, like I said, he doesn't want his lover Jamie to be alone.Now just moving to this part of the film, I can honestly say that I was 'IN'. Forget that James and Jamie and their newly found third lover Ceth (pronounced Seth) move things along rather quickly to the point where they're all pretty much engaged in certain 'activities'. By this point, I was 'IN'!!! REALLY, I was!!! But then...I don't (can't) really elaborate on what happens. Though I CAN say that the national anthem is sung by Jamie and all I could think at that point was 'I'M OUT'!!! Because to have to have Jamie sing the anthem (as it were) was sooo unnecessary. It's like the director was afraid to do the scene straight (seriously, no pun intended!) And so he had to insert these 'funny' moments. Though to me, they came off as 'funny odd'?It's like I wish I could've told the director to trust his audience to be able to take the scene as it was. Or as it could've been.Because all of the silliness of the singing of the national anthem, sorta reduced the scene and really threw it away. Like the scene could've really did something amazing. It could've shed some light and truth and honesty. And been really powerful. Only with the singing, the whole thing came off as a big 'WHAT'?And the thing that kills me, is that the actors involved in the scene were TOTALLY on board with the whole thing. (And that's what can make an audience be on board too!) I mean, I didn't notice any of the actors holding back, so why did it seem as though the director was holding back? (By resorting to comedy.)I felt like this movie did this a lot. It was all trying to be out there with this level of (well, insert adult content here) but then it would sorta turn the corner with all this zany stuff--like this big confrontational scene at the 'Shortbus' between the couple's counselor and this guy who's been hanging kinda close to James and Jamie.

Though the film's intentions are quite admirable and worth a glance, the film fails to be anything but a graphically oversexed diddy with a little heart and a playful wink.Mitchell's choice to gather as many unknown actors to star in his film was probably a smart move as there would have been no one in Hollywood with the balls-pun intended-to take such risks as these actors have done. However, the reason for these actors to go all the way  just isn't good enough. There's a trapeze act going on in 'Shortbus' that teeters between pornographic and melodramatic. The way the film presents its sexually graphic scenes are done quite naturally and even a bit humorous, but to what advantage? What kind of impression is the audience going to get with all these graphic images being displayed? In the end, it just boils down to two people actually screwing on film (sometimes only one . . . or three!). Now,I for one am not about censoring-especially when it comes to nudity and sexuality, but I have to be honest that even I was shocked and somewhat appalled as to what I saw. I think I probably wouldn't have felt that way if 'Shortbus' just got over its artsy self and call itself porn with a story (which, I'm sorry, isn't anything novel). Do I really need to see a man pleasure himself with his own mouth? If that question there bothered the hell out of you, then you haven't seen anything yet!Those of you who loved 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', as I did, beware. This is new territory for Mitchell to experiment with and your tolerance to sex and nudity will be tested. I applaud the actors for being so fearless and Mitchell for coming up with a good concept, but perhaps like Todd Haynes's equally interesting experiment, 'I'm Not There', 'Shortbus' only amounts to an interesting concept. I feel that it's defintely worth your time watching at least once. It's no piece of garbage, I assure you.

1037661,A2AREUQXKG7PCG,B000LAZDQA,Snow Leopard,"[2, 2]","Remember Caligula, with it's R-rated and X-rated version; the debate then was over the relative merits of both, and the same debate now hovers around this film.Forget about that part.  The film is sexually graphic, but not gratuitous at key moments (like in the beginning, when the film is establishing what you're going to be likely to see, or in the moments when personal or a couple's pleasure is a material part of their existence). The rest of the time, as in the club Shortbus itself, the sex is brilliantly gratuitous, in precisely the best way it can be.But again, we went for the sex, but what we got is a film.  John Cameron Mitchell (writer and director, of ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" as well) has now, I'd say, established himself as a filmmaker of preeminent relevance. Both of his films have a very definite, if hard to name, something--a world-weariness that's not exactly jaded, certainly a quirky eye for details that is not merely surreal. To make an irresponsible comparison, brilliant as Charlie Kaufman's movies are, the strange worlds they evoke are always somewhat contrived, perhaps wonderfully so. The strange world that John Cameron Mitchell lets us see are wholly realized, but still a kind of alternate reality. Yes, it's New York. Yes, it's the scene. But at the same time, it's super-real in a way that extremely few other filmmakers can manage.I'm trying not to do spoilers here, but there are three perfect examples of what I mean.  When Sofia and Rob confront the problems in their relationship by using psychological techniques from Sofia's couples counseling practice, this perfectly embeds both the sense and the meaning of their interaction. Similarly, it may not be immediately clear at first why Severin and Sofia should meet in a sensory deprivation tank--maybe it seems like simply a quirky detail--but both the safety of the setting and that sensory deprivation implies a lack of feeling turns out to be exactly the right context to frame that conversation. Even without this insight, the choice of a sensory deprivation tank is wonderful. Still later in the movie, a truth or dare dare has James and Severin in a closet, having a very heart-to-heart conversation. Again, the setting is perfect to the theme, and yet subtle enough without browbeating the viewer, to say nothing of paralleling Severin and Sofia in the deprivation tank as well.I am certain that the entire film is put together with this much care and attention throughout.  Why, for instance, are there two characters (Jamie and Severin) who have alternate names? (That Jamie changes his name to James rather obviously expresses his increasing distance from his boyfriend, Jamie.) One could note also that there is a ton of sex and rock n roll in this movie (look at the long soundtrack list at the end), but not drugs. Or that the overwhelming number of scenes are shot inside; even Sofia's jaunt in the park is not an actual exterior shot.This is just another way to realize that John Cameron Mitchell is showing us a realized (artistic) vision of the world, and not New York itself; a fact emphasized, perhaps, by the animated cartoon version of New York that is the backdrop for the film, and that the ex-Mayor of New York in the film is Tobias, a fictional mayor, but one who is strongly reminiscent of Ed Koch in a number of ways. For those familiar with the controversies surrounding Koch during the AIDS crisis, the admission in the film that the ex-Mayor is gay portends to be not only a sly counterfactual, but even a kind of painful moment of healing for gay New Yorkers who have long felt betrayed by the Mayor. Yes, this is fiction, but it's an alternate reality, where he-who-was-closeted finally tells the truth, as it were.  Mitchell is clever enough to write the scene in such a way that you don't need to know all of this background to feel its pathos; mentioning it here is mostly just to underscore the deliberate wicked craft of the writing. Or, if this may be suggested even more briefly in one other way, as Severin is running a patter for the sake of Sofia's fantasy, there is a line, something to the effect of:  ""Phil Mudd approached the table and asked, `Is someone sitting here?'"" The reply is, ""No one's ever sat there.""  That's a brilliant, very outside-of-the-box moment of writing; one that comes from a point of view of long-standing loneliness, where no one ever sits. It's a beautifully perfect thing for Severin to say, all the more poignantly in something she is imagining as a fantasy.  The whole movie is informed by this outsiderness, which was equally palpable in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch.""Ultimately, it is this kind of care and attention and coherence that makes the sex not gratuitous, because even Shortbus itself (the sex club) is, again, precisely the context that the film's themes calls for.It is not often that a movie lingers with me after I watch it, and the ones that have, have since entered the pantheon of great movie experiences for me.  In and of itself, this may mean nothing to you, but if you can see past the mere titillation of the film, there's something haunting and effective here. And funny and honest too.Ultimately, the difference between the R-rated and X-rated Caligula was merely sex. By contrast, Shortbus integrates sex deeply into the characters in a way that thoroughly motivates it.

And I was not really going into this movie expecting to be moved emotionally. Most of the time you watch these movies for the cheap thrill of watching a sex movie where the director and actors try to push a story out of what essentially is pornography. Most of these movies seem to get the whole unsimulated sex part out of the way and then surround it with obnoxious characters and tiresome dialogue. One of the better movies of this ilk,9 songs - Unrated Full Uncut Version, is more fascinating than entertaining since Margo Stiley's character is so awful that you begin to prefer the music scenes to the sex scenes.What makes this movie revelatory is how much it is about relationships and non-traditional relationships which are even more complex and crazy than monogamous (or monogamish) ones. These are the kind of relationships that most people chalk up to college experimentation and kind of sad after a certain age (like smoking pot). But people are kinky and they have issues that aren't necessarily all about sex. Besides, prudes have Jane Austin and pretty much every other romantic comedy.Second, unless you are a bisexual libertine, there are sex scenes that you may find awesome but there will be other scenes that will just make you uncomfortable and wanting to look away (or strangely fascinated by - like the guy trying to use yoga to orally pleasure himself - which always seemed to be the main point to yoga anyhow).But since this movie is not pornography but a meditation on sex and relationships, it becomes a surprisingly sweet movie about how people want connection, lose their connections and will try anything for the companionship. Alternately funny and sentimental, this movie is ultimately a decent movie about people trying to navigate the world of sexuality and relationships in a world that isn't so narrowly defined.",5,Surprisingly Sweet and Sentimental,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1961,"['think', 'remember', 'Dan', 'Savage', 'promoting', 'movie', 'movie', 'unsimulated', 'sex', ""n't"", 'didactic', 'dull', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'going', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'moved', 'emotionally', 'Most', 'time', 'watch', 'movies', 'cheap', 'thrill', 'watching', 'sex', 'movie', 'where', 'director', 'actors', 'try', 'push', 'story', 'what', 'essentially', 'pornography', 'Most', 'movies', 'seem', 'get', 'whole', 'unsimulated', 'sex', 'part', 'way', 'then', 'surround', 'obnoxious', 'characters', 'tiresome', 'dialogue', 'One', 'better', 'movies', 'ilk,9', 'songs', 'Unrated', 'Full', 'Uncut', 'Version', 'more', 'fascinating', 'entertaining', 'Margo', 'Stiley', 'character', 'so', 'awful', 'begin', 'prefer', 'music', 'sex', 'scenes.What', 'movie', 'revelatory', 'how', 'much', 'relationships', 'non-traditional', 'relationships', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'crazy', 'monogamous', 'monogamish', 'ones', 'are', 'kind', 'relationships', 'most', 'people', 'chalk', 'college', 'experimentation', 'kind', 'sad', 'certain', 'age', 'smoking', 'pot', 'people', 'are', 'kinky', 'have', 'issues', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'all', 'sex', 'Besides', 'prudes', 'have', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedy.Second', 'are', 'bisexual', 'libertine', 'are', 'sex', 'scenes', 'may', 'find', 'awesome', 'will', 'be', 'other', 'scenes', 'will', 'just', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'wanting', 'look', 'away', 'strangely', 'fascinated', 'guy', 'trying', 'use', 'yoga', 'orally', 'pleasure', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'main', 'point', 'yoga', 'anyhow', '.But', 'movie', 'not', 'pornography', 'meditation', 'sex', 'relationships', 'surprisingly', 'sweet', 'movie', 'how', 'people', 'want', 'connection', 'lose', 'connections', 'will', 'try', 'anything', 'companionship', 'Alternately', 'funny', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'decent', 'movie', 'people', 'trying', 'navigate', 'world', 'sexuality', 'relationships', 'world', ""n't"", 'so', 'narrowly', 'defined']",Shortbus

1037668,A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B000LAZDQA,"Vincent E. Martin ""Darkbard""","[2, 2]","Bottom-Line: Shortbus is at times physically stimulating, but not as much as it is emotionally and mentally) arousing; and aren't those the two erogenous zones that matter most in sex?It's a sad testimony to American cinema that the vast majority of (Hollywood produced) movies come and go without much in the memory to mark their passing.  In their effort to appeal to a mass world-wide audience the denizens of the America's entertainment empire have taken to producing (mostly) movies without much heart, soul, or message.  Thankfully independent film producers and distributors (in this case Think Films) have stepped in and are beginning to release films that bring edge, promise, and meaning back to American cinema.  Such a movie is the (NC-17, sexually explicit ) Shortbus (2006), a biting, edgy, sex laden amusing romp set in contemporary New York City, written and directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch).Variety Magazine called Shortbus ""The most sexually graphic American narrative feature ever made outside the realm of the porn industry."" And make no mistake Shortbus is sexually graphic with depictions of real oral/vaginal sex, and masturbation.  Both heterosexual and homosexual are given equal time here folks so keep the kiddies far away from this movie.But despite the graphic nature of the sex in Shortbus, the film turns out to be a rather funny yet engaging film about sex, relationships, and people enjoying or trying to enjoy sex.  The sex is just a by-product of the relationships the individuals form over the course of the film; dare I say it flows naturally, it does not pretend to be, it just is.You know what you are in for from the opening frames of the film when James (Paul Dawson) is videotaping himself in the bathtub and playing with his penis (yes it is shown, there is full frontal nudity here folks) and then engages in a limber display of self-stimulation complete with (filmed) climax.  His home video at first seems narcissistic and even pornographic, but as the film progresses we get to know James for the deeply sad person he is and the reason for the film.  James is dad even as his (monogamous) partner of five years Jamie (P.J. DeBoy), is decidedly chipper and upbeat; i.e. his emotional polar opposite.  Jamie is almost frenzied, extroverted and just wants to love everybody, and want everybody to love him.Sensing something is wrong with James and their relationship, Jamie suggests that they experiment sexually with other people and this leads to a rather comical group sex (orgy) scene at a local apartment; the gathering is referred to as a Shortbus. Their search for answers also leads them to a sex therapist (who prefers to be called a couples therapist) named Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee).  During the opening sequence of the movie she is seen having wild engaging in (un-simulated) wild sex with her husband Rob (Raphael Barker) in every room in their apartment and trying positions straight from the Kama Sutra how-to manual.  But we soon learn that Sophia is pre-orgasmic (her term) meaning she has never had an orgasm--even through self stimulation and has been faking them for years in order to spare her husband ego.  So that the fact that she's a sex therapist proves to be one of the most deliciously ironic sub-plots of the movie, as she tries again and again to achieve one.And then there is Severin (Lindsay Beamish) a dominatrix who is so closed off that she forbids anyone to touch her, though she surrounds herself with Polaroid's she takes of random people.  But she is lonely and longs for a normal life with a house, white picket fence, little ones, and vaginal orgasms.  And there is Ceth (Jay Brannan) who becomes the (brief) third in James and Jamie's relationship. Finally, there is a very flamboyant Justin Bond who runs Shortbus and a Caleb (Peter Stickles) a voyeuristic young man who has been watching James and Jamie from his apartment across the street.The cast of Shortbus is composed of mostly unknowns and newcomers; it's hard to image any Hollywood ""A"" listed actor/actress going as far as the characters did in the movie for the sake of their art-form (though Chloe Sevigny did her part in 2003's Brown Bunny).  But the lack of star presence lent a nice layer of realism to the film it might otherwise have lacked.The most poignant and challenging performances in Shortbus belong to Paul Dawson and Sook-Yin Lee, though the movie must have been challenging for all involved give the nature of the film.  And yet after I finished watching Shortbus it was not so much the explicit sex that stayed with me--though it left its mark--it was the deeper meaning of the film; trying to puzzle out the reasons for the various characters sexual hang-up's and other emotional trauma's.  Why did Sofia's orgasm continue to elude her; why is James so profoundly sad, so much so that he plans to take his own life; why is Severin so closed off?In the end what makes Shortbus such an eye-opening American film is not the explicit sex contained therein, but that the movie is not afraid to explore it in such a grown up manner; it does not titillate, nor does it insult, is shows us sex as it would be if the camera were not there.  To be sure Shortbus is at times physically stimulating, but not as much as it is emotionally and mentally) arousing; and aren't those the two erogenous zones that matter most in sex?Rated NC-17 for

1037669,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000LAZDQA,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[7, 13]","I must say that I was so curious about seeing this film for various reasons including the obvious why Sook-Yin Lee is this much talked about real-sex film by John Cameron Mitchell whose Hedwig movie was amazing. I have seen so much TV and films that are very far out there like Sex and The City, Nip/Tuck, and Queer as Folk, but it still didn't prepare me for a so suprisingly shocking film about sex, love, and relationship in New York. It's about gay, straight, bi, metro-sexual, and everything in between....Even the first 10 minutes of the film we are presented with scenes of real sex: the sex of various positions between Lee and her husband, the auto-fellatio(they actually show entire genital and actual ejaculation on camera...). Then it gets very wordy or conversational for a while until a ton of various sexual activities and orgies in the Shortbus club which the main setting of the film where Lee's sex therapist visits in pursuit to explore the depth of sex and relationships and ultimately she's the only woman there who is trying to experience her first orgasm. There is numerous moments the film looks very pornographic and documentary like. The main actors are very good and they all seem to be very comfortable to be part of the physical stuff. Sook-Yin is amazingly daring and vulnerable, and she was welling to really push the envelop doing this film. No wonder her boss from CBC threatened to fire her after she was cast for this film. She can act and she's much better actress than I had expected considered that she's more experinced as VJ and musician. I wonder if her family would accept her doing this film.Besides the shock value of the real sex appeal of this film, it very well dealt with various issues. I think Mitchell is such a daring and alternative director. Well, I didn't think that it was neccessary to have all these real sex, especially there is strong story and purpose emotionally and spiritually. It could have well been simulated sex. When I watched the credits, there is at least 30 ""Sextras"". I wonder how the crew handle working on those orgy scenes.",4,"Stimulating, provocative, introspective, and very orgasmic!!!",1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,2099,"['must', 'say', 'was', 'so', 'curious', 'seeing', 'film', 'various', 'reasons', 'including', 'obvious', 'why', 'Sook-Yin', 'Lee', 'much', 'talked', 'real-sex', 'film', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'Hedwig', 'movie', 'was', 'amazing', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'TV', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'far', 'there', 'Sex', 'City', 'Nip/Tuck', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'prepare', 'so', 'suprisingly', 'shocking', 'film', 'sex', 'love', 'relationship', 'New', 'York', 'gay', 'straight', 'bi', 'metro-sexual', 'everything', '.Even', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'presented', 'scenes', 'real', 'sex', 'sex', 'various', 'positions', 'Lee', 'husband', 'auto-fellatio', 'actually', 'show', 'entire', 'genital', 'actual', 'ejaculation', 'camera', 'Then', 'very', 'wordy', 'conversational', 'while', 'ton', 'various', 'sexual', 'activities', 'orgies', 'Shortbus', 'club', 'main', 'setting', 'film', 'where', 'Lee', 'sex', 'therapist', 'visits', 'pursuit', 'explore', 'depth', 'sex', 'relationships', 'ultimately', 'only', 'woman', 'who', 'trying', 'experience', 'first', 'orgasm', 'numerous', 'moments', 'film', 'very', 'pornographic', 'documentary', 'like', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'comfortable', 'be', 'part', 'physical', 'stuff', 'Sook-Yin', 'amazingly', 'daring', 'vulnerable', 'was', 'welling', 'really', 'push', 'envelop', 'doing', 'film', 'wonder', 'boss', 'CBC', 'threatened', 'fire', 'was', 'cast', 'film', 'can', 'act', 'much', 'better', 'actress', 'had', 'expected', 'considered', 'more', 'experinced', 'VJ', 'musician', 'wonder', 'family', 'would', 'accept', 'doing', 'shock', 'value', 'real', 'sex', 'appeal', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'dealt', 'various', 'issues', 'think', 'Mitchell', 'such', 'daring', 'alternative', 'director', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'neccessary', 'have', 'real', 'sex', 'especially', 'strong', 'story', 'purpose', 'emotionally', 'spiritually', 'could', 'have', 'well', 'been', 'simulated', 'sex', 'When', 'watched', 'credits', 'least', '30', 'Sextras', 'wonder', 'how', 'crew', 'working', 'orgy', 'scenes']",Shortbus
