I spent a few months on the Basic and then moved on to the Advanced. Once again, it just about killed me! I stuck with it, lost about 15 pounds, and am now in great shape. I continue to use the Advanced along with other TaeBo DVDs and am still losing some weight, even though I'm also addicted to chocolate!If you want a really hard workout, TaeBo Advanced is it!

470642,A3K4OSWZE8GZAZ,6305608733,E. Evans,"[5, 7]","Tae Bo was at one time the hottest fitness craze in the country. This DVD has the four workouts that started it all. Tae Bo is effective and fun as are these workouts. However, the way these videos were filmed is awful, which is why this only earns three stars for me. The lighting is either too dim or is dominated by a strobe light. Blanks' cueing is not very good; he directs you to use your right or left arm, for example, based on what he is doing in the studio, not on how you will be mirroring him at home. There are numerous distracting mistakes where either Blanks or one of the other exercisers gets lost. The music is worse than most fitness videos. Blanks' no-nonsense, yet supportive personality, however, shines. I really enjoy him as an instructor.The Instructional workout is important to do in order to insure that you are completing the moves with the correct form. Do it once and then dive into the Basic workout. If you are new to kickboxing or exercise in general, this will give you a nice workout. I quickly outgrew this workout, however, because it is just too short at less than 30 minutes. The Advanced workout at almost an hour long is VERY advanced. There are times when the kicks are so fast that it is easy to lose proper form. There are twenty tough minutes of floor exercises that target your glutes, hips, and thighs at the end of the kickboxing segment. Blanks includes ab exercises, as well, but I find them to be inadequate. The 8 Minute Workout is actually 14-minutes long when you include the warm-up and cool-down. I found that it was the most useful to do as an addition to the Basic workout to create a more intermediate-level workout.The more recent Tae Bo workouts are far better produced and Blanks has much improved his cueing.

As a result it's often difficult to find a good  workout that doesn't jar my knee. Aerboics often contains too much jumping.  I realize every knee problem differs, but I have used the Tae-bo basics  tape on a daily basis without knee pain.I must say, I'm not sure buying  the four-pack tape set was necessary. I used the Instructional Tape once.  The information contained here is important but if known beforehand, owning  the tape is a moot point. The gist of it is, don't overextend your joints  while kicking and punching.I've used the 8 minute workout when I get up  late in the morning. However, I almost wish I didn't have the option as it  creates greater opportunity to slack off. 8 minutes really isn't enough to  get your heart rate up to a point of significance, in terms of  exercise.The Advanced Tape is really hard! Also, this one tended to hurt  my knees. There are some lunging moves, and a whole lot of floor exercises  that require you to kneel for lengthy periods of time. I think the decision  on whether this tape is a good investment really depends on the level of  activity you are looking for in an exercise video. This tape is long and  strenuous, but I'm certain if you use it regularly you'd be very fit.  Personally, I've never found the time commitment or the desire to use this  tape more than a couple times.Tae-bo Basics I would rate as five stars.

Actually, this is a very poor quality workout video for many reasons...All B. Blanks does is count 1 to 8 from start to finish, yell &quot;come on&quot; all the time, which is sooo annoying, and provides very little fitness education. You really don't even need the Instructional video at all, since the moves aren't that complicated, so the 4-pack is a waste of money. Don't expect to get a good work-out in 8 minutes either. You have to work out at least 30 minutes at a time, at least 3 days a week, to see any benefit.The music is awful, and the moves aren't even coordinated with it. When the moves are double-timed, it's impossible to keep up, the moves are frantic and unsafe, and even the exercisers on the video aren't keeping up. B. Blanks spends most of the video saying &quot;come on, come on girl&quot; rather than exercising, and he almost never exercises through the double-timed moves.I gave this video 2 stars rather than one because you probably will lose weight doing it, but I've done a lot of exercise videos and think that there are a lot better, safer exercise videos out there where the instructors are more interesting and the moves more organized overall. Another thing that annoyed me about this video was the exercising AFTER a cool-down. Very strange.

I became addicted to Tae-Bo a little over three months ago and can't stop doing it!  It does not matter what fitness level you're at, you can do Tae-Bo.  Tae-Bo is amazing because it allows you to take your frustration, anger, fears, etc. and channel them into something productive: getting in shape.  Billy Blanks keeps you motivated throughout the entire workout.  The workout is energizing and so much FUN!  I cannot imagine going back to regular and step aerobics.  This might sound crazy, but Tae-Bo has become a way of life.  I work out about 6 times a week or whenever I can find the time.  Every day, I notice more and more definition in my abs.  I punch harder and kick higher with every workout.  My skin has a glow to it now.  I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SWIMSUIT SEASON!  I'm not tired anymore and my energy is off the charts!  My self esteem and confidence levels have sky rocketed.  I used to walk with my head down, staring at the sidewalk.  NOT ANYMORE!  Tae-Bo is the most empowering thing that I have ever done for myself.  I'm not afraid to walk across campus after night classes anymore.  This is not just another fad.  Tae-Bo has actually been around for about a decade already and it's not going anywhere.  I will continue to do this workout for the rest of my life.  Still skeptical?

470653,AISSRJ7E2L375,6305608733,"Kelly Garbato ""Marchpane!""","[26, 27]","I've been doing Tae Bo for about 15 months, and have dropped 30 pounds (and counting!).  I started at a very unhealthy 140 pounds (just for reference, I'm 5'4""), and I'm now down to a lean, mean, fighting-machine 110.  I'm in better shape than I've ever been, and I owe it all to Tae Bo!Before starting Tae Bo, I had tried several other workouts, to no avail.  At one point I was working out with Jane Fonda an hour a day, every day, and was actually gaining weight!  I bought the Tae Bo original 4-pack on a whim, but it sat on my shelf for years before I finally gave it a go - I had watched my sister do it, and it just looked too hard.  Eventually I had trouble squeezing into my fat jeans and, frustrated, I made the commitment to lose some weight and stick with Tae Bo for at least a year.I began by watching the Instructional video for a week and practicing the moves.  Admittedly, this was rather tedious - the pace is very slow and you end up standing around most of the time.  However, correct form is essential, both to prevent injury and properly work the targeted muscle groups.  Before beginning even a Basic workout, you should definitely run through the Instructional video a few times.  You won't regret it!Once I had the moves down, I went on to the 30-minute Basic workout, and stuck with it for six months.  I was so horrendously out of shape that I had to stop for breathers, even though Billy gives you plenty of rest in between exercises.  It took quite some time before I was comfortable with the moves, but I did get there.  If you're new to Tae Bo (or to exercising in general), you'll probably find even the Basic workout to be challenging.  Don't give up, though - it might take some time, but you WILL see improvement.  I was very frustrated at first, as I didn't start shedding the pounds right away, and my lack of balance was a significant obstacle.  Around the fourth month, though, I noticed some definite improvement, and was confident enough after month six to move on to the Advanced workout.Initially, I found the Advanced workout to be difficult, but after a few months I had mastered it as well.  By this time I had lost about 20 pounds and gained a ton of confidence.  I finally retired the original Tae Bo workouts six months ago and moved on to the Get Ripped and Ultimate Abs/Butt series.  After seeing how demanding the newer workouts are, I'm extremely glad I started with the original 4-pack - had I overestimated my abilities, I seriously doubt that I would still be doing Tae Bo.  I probably would have given up within the first week instead!The Advanced workout, which runs 55 minutes, is paced more quickly than the Basic workout, though it's much slower than, say, the Get Ripped Advanced workout or the Ultimate Abs/Butt DVD.  In addition to the kicking/punching combos that you learn in the Basic workout, you also do some floor work for your abdominals and gluteals.  Billy really introduces a wide variety of exercises during this session, many of which you'll see again if you try out other videos.  This is a great intermediate workout - it really bridges the gap between the Basic workout and the more intense Advanced workouts that he produced later on.For anyone who's new to Tae Bo, I'd definitely recommend that you pick up this 4-pack before buying anything else.  Each workout builds on the previous one and, when viewed in succession, they offer a great introduction to Tae Bo.  If you try to just jump right in with an Advanced workout, you'll not only get discouraged, but you might even hurt yourself.  For those of you who are shopping around for a new fitness program, look no further - Tae Bo is fun and effective.  Plus, with so many different DVDs available, you'll never get bored or plateau.  Should you find your mind wandering or your weight loss stalling, just try another workout.A word of caution - Tae Bo certainly isn't without its flaws.  The production quality isn't the best (this is especially true with the earlier videos).  Billy also tends to switch quickly from one move to the next, and to do uneven repetitions on each side (a problem he has yet to resolve).  Nonetheless, this is the best workout series I've tried.  It's transformed me from a couch potato to a fitness freak!",4,Must-have introductory package for Tae Bo beginners!,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,4270,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'about', '15', 'months', 'have', 'dropped', '30', 'pounds', 'counting', 'started', 'very', 'unhealthy', '140', 'pounds', 'just', 'reference', ""'m"", '5', '4', ""'m"", 'now', 'down', 'lean', 'mean', 'fighting-machine', '110', ""'m"", 'better', 'shape', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'owe', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'starting', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'had', 'tried', 'several', 'other', 'workouts', 'avail', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'working', 'out', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'hour', 'day', 'day', 'was', 'actually', 'gaining', 'weight', 'bought', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'original', '4-pack', 'whim', 'sat', 'shelf', 'years', 'finally', 'gave', 'go', 'had', 'watched', 'sister', 'do', 'just', 'looked', 'too', 'hard', 'Eventually', 'had', 'trouble', 'squeezing', 'fat', 'jeans', 'frustrated', 'made', 'commitment', 'lose', 'weight', 'stick', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'least', 'year.I', 'began', 'watching', 'Instructional', 'video', 'week', 'practicing', 'moves', 'Admittedly', 'was', 'rather', 'tedious', 'pace', 'very', 'slow', 'end', 'up', 'standing', 'most', 'time', 'However', 'correct', 'form', 'essential', 'prevent', 'injury', 'properly', 'work', 'targeted', 'muscle', 'groups', 'beginning', 'even', 'Basic', 'workout', 'should', 'definitely', 'run', 'Instructional', 'video', 'few', 'times', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'Once', 'had', 'moves', 'down', 'went', '30-minute', 'Basic', 'workout', 'stuck', 'six', 'months', 'was', 'so', 'horrendously', 'shape', 'had', 'stop', 'breathers', 'even', 'Billy', 'plenty', 'rest', 'exercises', 'took', 'quite', 'time', 'was', 'comfortable', 'moves', 'did', 'get', 'there', ""'re"", 'new', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'exercising', 'general', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'even', 'Basic', 'workout', 'be', 'challenging', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'might', 'take', 'time', 'WILL', 'see', 'improvement', 'was', 'very', 'frustrated', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'shedding', 'pounds', 'right', 'away', 'lack', 'balance', 'was', 'significant', 'obstacle', 'fourth', 'month', 'noticed', 'definite', 'improvement', 'was', 'confident', 'enough', 'month', 'six', 'move', 'Advanced', 'workout.Initially', 'found', 'Advanced', 'workout', 'be', 'difficult', 'few', 'months', 'had', 'mastered', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'had', 'lost', '20', 'pounds', 'gained', 'ton', 'confidence', 'finally', 'retired', 'original', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'moved', 'Get', 'Ripped', 'Ultimate', 'Abs/Butt', 'series', 'seeing', 'how', 'demanding', 'newer', 'workouts', 'are', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'glad', 'started', 'original', '4-pack', 'had', 'overestimated', 'abilities', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'doing', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'first', 'week', 'instead', 'Advanced', 'workout', '55', 'minutes', 'paced', 'more', 'quickly', 'Basic', 'workout', 'much', 'slower', 'say', 'Get', 'Ripped', 'Advanced', 'workout', 'Ultimate', 'Abs/Butt', 'DVD', 'addition', 'kicking/punching', 'combos', 'learn', 'Basic', 'workout', 'also', 'do', 'floor', 'work', 'abdominals', 'gluteals', 'Billy', 'really', 'wide', 'variety', 'exercises', 'session', 'many', ""'ll"", 'see', 'again', 'try', 'out', 'other', 'videos', 'great', 'intermediate', 'really', 'gap', 'Basic', 'workout', 'more', 'intense', 'Advanced', 'workouts', 'produced', 'later', 'on.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'new', 'Tae', 'Bo', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', '4-pack', 'buying', 'anything', 'else', 'workout', 'previous', 'one', 'when', 'viewed', 'succession', 'offer', 'great', 'introduction', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'try', 'just', 'jump', 'right', 'Advanced', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'not', 'only', 'get', 'discouraged', 'might', 'even', 'hurt', 'who', 'are', 'shopping', 'new', 'fitness', 'program', 'look', 'further', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'fun', 'effective', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'DVDs', 'available', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'bored', 'plateau', 'Should', 'find', 'mind', 'wandering', 'weight', 'loss', 'stalling', 'just', 'try', 'workout.A', 'word', 'caution', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'flaws', 'production', 'quality', ""n't"", 'best', 'especially', 'true', 'earlier', 'videos', 'Billy', 'also', 'switch', 'quickly', 'one', 'move', 'next', 'do', 'uneven', 'repetitions', 'side', 'problem', 'yet', 'resolve', 'Nonetheless', 'best', 'workout', 'series', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'transformed', 'couch', 'potato', 'fitness', 'freak']","Billy Blanks' Tae-Bo - Instructional Workout, Basic, Advanced, 8-Minute Workout"

You can instantly go to any workout (although there are not chapters within each workout - which makes sense when you think about it).  There is no tape to wear out and  repurchase, which, with something you watch every other day or so, is a  nice feature in itself.The instructional workout is actually a little  harder than the basic full speed workout as you are moving through the  excercises in almost slow motion.  However, it is invaluable for learning  the correct form for each movement.Be warned (in a good way) that this  is not the aerobics workout from the mid-eighties.  It feels like practice  for a sport rather than modified dance and makes you feel more powerful  when you have mastered the kick, punches and combinations.  Be careful of  hyperextending knees and elbows (which Billy Blanks stresses several times  in the instructional section).These workouts make a nice complement to  weight training.  And remember this - Billy Blanks does not look like he  does from just doing aerobic excercise.  He obviously spends many hours in  the gym with weights in addition to this type of workout.

If you have every done a Billy Blanks video before, you probably know 95% of the moves already anyway. I am still working my way through the Basic video, which gets me working up a pretty good sweat. It would be nice, though, if it was a little longer. With the warm-up and cool-down, it is probably 30 minutes long. But the 4pack also includes a more high energy 8 minute workout, which I have been trying to do in addition to the Basic so I feel like I have exercised enough. I briefly scanned the Advanced workout and am pretty sure that I am NOT ready for it yet. But hopefully I will get there soon.So I can say that the Basic workout is great for beginners, and the 8 minute workout is a good addition to it.

Plus my class schedule has so many 8-5 days in it that I don't have time to hit the gym. SO, I decided just after Thanksgiving to start doing a workout tape regime that would kill less time and still keep me in shape.My first tape...Callanetics. Great sculpting workout, but no cardio. The immediate first thought...Tae Bo. I have a lot of friends who sang the praises of Billy Blanks, but I had yet to see myself what cardio kickboxing was all about. I bought the DVD version (1) because it was actually cheaper than the tapes and (2) had all the tapes rolled up into one slim package that would probably last longer anyway.I did what the instructions told me and did the introductory workout first. This teaches you the basics of the moves he likes to incorporate into the routines. Although I feel that he could have explained some of the positions better (i.e., when you do the roundhouse kicks, turn the foot you're standing on OUT...it will help twist your hips down so you can lift your leg as high as possible while working out your gluteal muscles...he doesn't emphasize this, just tells you to keep your hand on your hip and kick to the side), you find out his workout is relatively simple in technique. However, he warns you that he CAN and WILL make it more PHYSICALLY difficult as you progress.I then advanced to the basics workout. Being an avid runner and gym rat, I found this to be a pretty decent workout. Built up a respectable sweat and felt empowered...just pictured kicking ex-boyfriends in the face. :) Plus, I surprised myself with how fierce I can feel...really lets out stress and remains fun.The advanced workout...whoa.  Not for the faint of heart.  45 minutes of cardio with many many many fast sequences of kicks and jabs that will make you feel like a puppet being yanked in eight different directions...it's great.  :)  Then, the floor work...you probably have never done so many doggy-lifts in your life!  Killer!  :)  I highly recommend this DVD!",4,Literally,1042243200,"01 11, 2003",2003,2082,"['Living', 'New', 'England', 'running', 'routine', 'somewhat', 'gone', 'down', 'tubes', 'due', 'frigid', 'weather', 'class', 'schedule', 'so', 'many', '8-5', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'hit', 'gym', 'SO', 'decided', 'just', 'Thanksgiving', 'start', 'doing', 'workout', 'tape', 'regime', 'would', 'kill', 'less', 'time', 'still', 'keep', 'shape.My', 'first', 'tape', 'Callanetics', 'Great', 'sculpting', 'workout', 'cardio', 'immediate', 'first', 'thought', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'have', 'lot', 'friends', 'who', 'sang', 'praises', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'had', 'yet', 'see', 'what', 'cardio', 'kickboxing', 'was', 'bought', 'DVD', 'version', '1', 'was', 'actually', 'cheaper', 'tapes', '2', 'had', 'tapes', 'rolled', 'up', 'one', 'slim', 'package', 'would', 'probably', 'last', 'longer', 'anyway.I', 'did', 'what', 'instructions', 'told', 'did', 'introductory', 'workout', 'first', 'basics', 'moves', 'incorporate', 'routines', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'explained', 'positions', 'better', 'i.e.', 'when', 'do', 'roundhouse', 'kicks', 'turn', 'foot', ""'re"", 'standing', 'OUT', 'will', 'help', 'twist', 'hips', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'lift', 'leg', 'as', 'high', 'possible', 'working', 'out', 'gluteal', 'muscles', ""n't"", 'emphasize', 'just', 'keep', 'hand', 'hip', 'kick', 'side', 'find', 'out', 'workout', 'relatively', 'simple', 'technique', 'However', 'CAN', 'WILL', 'make', 'more', 'PHYSICALLY', 'difficult', 'progress.I', 'then', 'advanced', 'basics', 'workout', 'Being', 'avid', 'runner', 'gym', 'rat', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'workout', 'Built', 'up', 'respectable', 'sweat', 'felt', 'empowered', 'just', 'pictured', 'kicking', 'ex-boyfriends', 'face', 'surprised', 'how', 'fierce', 'can', 'feel', 'really', 'out', 'stress', 'fun.The', 'advanced', 'workout', 'whoa', 'Not', 'faint', 'heart', '45', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'fast', 'sequences', 'kicks', 'jabs', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'puppet', 'being', 'yanked', 'eight', 'different', 'directions', 'great', 'Then', 'floor', 'work', 'probably', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'doggy-lifts', 'life', 'Killer', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']","Billy Blanks' Tae-Bo - Instructional Workout, Basic, Advanced, 8-Minute Workout"

These videos do have their faults, but I have been doing them for several years now--this is not something I can say about any other workout video or equipment.  I may stray from Tae Bo from time to time, but always come back.  The most valuable video in the set is the Basic.  It is a good, short workout.  The instructional video is good to watch once.  The advanced workout is REALLY advanced and many of the moves are HARD to do.  When the Basic video became a little too &quot;basic&quot; for me, I turned to the advanced version and found I couldn't do it.  However, it did give me ideas to advance the basic version on my own.  I incorporate some of the additions in the advanced version to the basic to make it a more challenging, more effective workout.  I have never done anything but watch through the 8 minute video.  If I can only work out for 8 minutes, I find it's not worth my time.

I have been on an nostalgic bent lately regarding exercise and I found a download of the advanced routine and quickly grabbed it. As soon as the class started I got a lump in my throat like seeing old friends again after years apart.(Man, Shellie looks like she is 13!)  Since doing this class I must have done at least 100 other videos but I knew in 10 minutes of viewing that this is still as great now as it was then.Since this was recorded on video 14 years it will naturally look dated.

One thing many people out there will love about this is there is a whole lot less COUNTING on this one although Billy does count and he does have Shellie count when he is teaching.The class is 55 minutes.  You have 33 minutes of cardio and then he slightly cools you down for floor work. The next part is the best part about this class the LEGENDARY 11 minute floor leg routine.  Man that thing BURNS!

470666,A6IAANZCSHK9Q,6305608733,"Reginald M. Lumagui ""green_lantern_2814""","[36, 54]","Well, I consider myself fairly athletic having take various martial arts like wing chun and muay thai. I can run 3-5 miles without a problem and then go for 30-45 minutes of circuit weight training. I can honestly say  that the Taebo dvd set does offer a challenge, but not as much for the  advanced athelete. This is not a true kickboxing or martial arts program so  comparing Taebo to them is a bit unfair. It's strictly an aerobics type  exercise that uses some elements of various martial arts to bring up your  heart rate so it should be evaluated as such. In this way, it does its job  pretty well. The basics section did fairly well in demonstrating the basic  methods of punching and kicking, but it didn't cover everything. I'd hope  it would cover most of the combos in the later tapes so that I wouldn't  feel awkward doing them. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The beginners  section of the dvd offers a good workout. Nice slow pace and adequate  amount of exercise time. Intermediates or advanced people will feel this  section too short like I did. Finally, the advanced section really makes  you sweat, but then again, I did do the basics, beginners, and advanced  section consecutively to give myself a better workout. There are some parts  to the advance workout where the moves feel awkward at first. I wish they  had  covered some of these moves that don't feel natural in the basics  tapes to give me some time to practice them.  Anyways, as for the dvd  itself, all four tapes are copied unto one yellow covered disc. Nice though  somewhat tacky looking. The video itself leaves something to be desired as  there is alot of noticeable shimmering and artifacting during switching  scenes. It gets kinda annoying, but then I didn't buy this dvd for its  looks but the workout it offers. I also had some problems with audio  dropping off a little, but it may just be my disc. What's also nice is that  there is chapter searching on the disc though it might not be evident at  first since there's no chapter search in the main selection page.

Still, there's something about the way Billy Blanks presents his moves that seem very....masculine, instead of the foofy, supermodel way done in previous &quot;kick boxing aerobic&quot; videos I've seen. While said videos generally feature some well-known model with just-done hair and full makeup, Billy has selectd people who started out with him and lost weight and became strong through his program. He also has several DIFFERENT kind of people, not just cutsie-chicas with a recent dye job. I was amazed at how out of shape I was- I expected to just breeze through the &quot;basic&quot; tape and move right into the &quot;advanced&quot; tape within a week. NOPE! This particular workout gradually builds your strength and endurance. The non-girly moves make you feel powerful and strong, and (hint-hint, guys) it's a workout I think most men won't mind doing alongside their women. I was surprised to find that after one workout with the &quot;advanced&quot; tape, I went to put my jeans on the next day and they slipped right past my shelf-like hips. Magnifico! Worth the $$$, effort and time. If, like me, you've become lukewarm to the typical workout video, try TaeBo- you won't be disappointed (if you faithfully follow the program).",5,Aaaagh!!!

First there is the instructional workout then you move onto the basic workout. Next is the advanced workout and last but not least is the 8 minnute workout. The instructional workout tells you all about tae-bo and how to do tae-bo and its about 14 minnutes. The basic workout is not a fast pace but not a slow pace workout. Its right in between those two and is about 27 minnutes. The advanced workout is about 57 minnutes and is for people who know how to do tae-bo really well at a fast pace which is probably why they call it advanced. The last video is the 8 minnute workout which is only 8 minnutes. It may only be 8 minnutes but it gets you moving. Its the final touch to the collection because you really are pumping iron in this workout. After doing the workout several times you'll feel the burn and thats a good thing.

I had already resigned myself to being a pudgy, unhealthy gal because I absolutely DESPISE the idea of working out in front of others.  I got this set as a gift about a year and a half ago and it's made a ton of difference in my exercise routine.  Now I actually have one!For starters, I should say I don't think this is a workout for everyone.  My friends used this series on and off but didn't take to it as quickly or as enthusiastically as I did.  If you're not into kickboxing or karate, this probably isn't the series for you.  Some of my friends, for instance, preferred more straight up aerobic workouts, and others preferred workouts with more coordinated dance elements.  So it's a personal choice if you want to do kickboxing.  I would only suggest taking this up if you like kickboxing and/or karate.That said, if you have a martial arts background, this is the workout for you!  Even if you don't have a martial arts background, but are interested in learning basic moves, this is a great series.  Billy Blanks is the real deal.  You can tell by his form that this guy knows his martial arts!  This may explain why I like this series so much.  I took karate for three years as a kid.  Accordingly, I think I took to learning the moves in this workout more easily than most of my friends.  I found the instructional video to be a total waste of time.  My friends without martial arts backgrounds said it was helpful, but only worth watching once, maybe two times max.  I did the basic workout for a couple of weeks, and then got bored and moved on to the advance.  Some of my friends have never tackled the advance and continue to stick to the basic workout.  It's hard to say whether the basic gives you a good workout or not.  My friends say it does, but I don't feel like it does at all.  Again, this may have to do with one's comfort level with the martial arts.  I'm not sure.The bulk of my praise is reserved for the advance workout.  This baby is an hour long and really kicks your butt, no matter what your fitness level!  I got into the groove of doing the advance five times a week, and I swear I was never as fit as I was then.  Of course, like all workouts, it gets monotonous after a while, so I don't do it as often as I used too.  I mostly run now (about 15 miles a week), but every once in a while, I'll pull out my advance Tae Bo tape, and it still kicks my butt every time!  It's ridiculously hard, but so incredibly worthwhile.  I always wake up the next morning a little sore from doing the advance tae bo workout and I love it.",5,This is the series that started me working out...,998006400,"08 17, 2001",2001,2583,"['Thank', 'God', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'had', 'already', 'resigned', 'being', 'pudgy', 'unhealthy', 'gal', 'absolutely', 'DESPISE', 'idea', 'working', 'out', 'front', 'others', 'got', 'set', 'gift', 'year', 'half', 'ago', 'made', 'ton', 'difference', 'exercise', 'routine', 'Now', 'actually', 'have', 'one', 'starters', 'should', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'workout', 'everyone', 'friends', 'used', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'quickly', 'as', 'enthusiastically', 'did', ""'re"", 'not', 'kickboxing', 'karate', 'probably', ""n't"", 'series', 'friends', 'instance', 'preferred', 'more', 'straight', 'up', 'aerobic', 'workouts', 'others', 'preferred', 'workouts', 'more', 'coordinated', 'dance', 'elements', 'personal', 'choice', 'want', 'do', 'kickboxing', 'would', 'only', 'suggest', 'taking', 'up', 'like', 'kickboxing', 'and/or', 'karate.That', 'said', 'have', 'martial', 'arts', 'background', 'workout', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'martial', 'arts', 'background', 'are', 'interested', 'learning', 'basic', 'moves', 'great', 'series', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'real', 'deal', 'can', 'tell', 'form', 'guy', 'martial', 'arts', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'like', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'took', 'karate', 'three', 'years', 'kid', 'Accordingly', 'think', 'took', 'learning', 'moves', 'workout', 'more', 'easily', 'most', 'friends', 'found', 'instructional', 'video', 'be', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'friends', 'martial', 'arts', 'backgrounds', 'said', 'was', 'helpful', 'only', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'maybe', 'two', 'times', 'max', 'did', 'basic', 'workout', 'couple', 'weeks', 'then', 'got', 'bored', 'moved', 'advance', 'friends', 'have', 'never', 'tackled', 'advance', 'continue', 'stick', 'basic', 'workout', 'hard', 'say', 'basic', 'good', 'workout', 'not', 'friends', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Again', 'may', 'have', 'do', 'one', 'comfort', 'level', 'martial', 'arts', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure.The', 'bulk', 'praise', 'reserved', 'advance', 'workout', 'baby', 'hour', 'long', 'really', 'kicks', 'butt', 'matter', 'what', 'fitness', 'level', 'got', 'groove', 'doing', 'advance', 'five', 'times', 'week', 'swear', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'fit', 'was', 'then', 'course', 'workouts', 'monotonous', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'often', 'used', 'too', 'mostly', 'run', 'now', '15', 'miles', 'week', 'once', 'while', ""'ll"", 'pull', 'out', 'advance', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'tape', 'still', 'butt', 'time', 'ridiculously', 'hard', 'so', 'incredibly', 'worthwhile', 'always', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'little', 'sore', 'doing', 'advance', 'tae', 'bo', 'workout', 'love']","Billy Blanks' Tae-Bo - Instructional Workout, Basic, Advanced, 8-Minute Workout"
