It is about the Goldolphin Arabian, how he and his young friend, a mute, young Arabian boy who loved and follows this horse through his life. It is the story of HOW the Goldolphin Arabian came to be in England.It is a good movie. And in many ways reminds you of the story of Black Beauty. I would recommend it for anyone who cares for or loves horses.(I would not be surprised that if most people of today were to search their horses pedigree, whether Quarter Horse, Paints, Thoroughbred and of course Arabians, they would end up tracing back to one of three Arabian Stallions that ended up in England during the 17th and early 18th Centuries. They were very Special Arabian Stallions. The Goldolphin Arabian, Darley Arabian and Byerley Turk Arabian are the three Stallions.)(All modern day Thoroughbreds trace back to these three stallions imported into England from the Middle East in the late 17th and early 18th centuries: the Byerley Turk (1680s), the Darley Arabian (1704), and the Godolphin Arabian (1729). One genetic study indicates that 95% of all male Thoroughbreds trace their direct male line (via the Y chromosome) to the Darley Arabian.[27] However, in modern Thoroughbred pedigrees, most horses have more crosses to the Godolphin Arabian (13.8%) than to the Darley Arabian (6.5%) when all lines of descent (maternal and paternal) are considered.)",5,KING OF THE WIND,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,1469,"['King', 'WindI', 'bought', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Goldolphin', 'Arabian', 'how', 'young', 'friend', 'mute', 'young', 'Arabian', 'boy', 'who', 'loved', 'horse', 'life', 'story', 'HOW', 'Goldolphin', 'Arabian', 'came', 'be', 'England.It', 'good', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'horses', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'most', 'people', 'today', 'were', 'search', 'horses', 'pedigree', 'Quarter', 'Horse', 'Paints', 'Thoroughbred', 'course', 'Arabians', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'tracing', 'back', 'one', 'three', 'Arabian', 'Stallions', 'ended', 'up', 'England', '17th', 'early', '18th', 'Centuries', 'were', 'very', 'Special', 'Arabian', 'Stallions', 'Goldolphin', 'Arabian', 'Darley', 'Arabian', 'Byerley', 'Turk', 'Arabian', 'are', 'three', 'Stallions', 'modern', 'day', 'Thoroughbreds', 'trace', 'back', 'three', 'stallions', 'imported', 'England', 'Middle', 'East', 'late', '17th', 'early', '18th', 'centuries', 'Byerley', 'Turk', '1680s', 'Darley', 'Arabian', '1704', 'Godolphin', 'Arabian', '1729', 'One', 'genetic', 'study', '95', '%', 'male', 'Thoroughbreds', 'trace', 'direct', 'male', 'line', 'Y', 'chromosome', 'Darley', 'Arabian', '27', ']', 'However', 'modern', 'Thoroughbred', 'pedigrees', 'most', 'horses', 'have', 'more', 'crosses', 'Godolphin', 'Arabian', '13.8', '%', 'Darley', 'Arabian', '6.5', '%', 'when', 'lines', 'descent', 'maternal', 'paternal', 'are', 'considered']",N/A

After being sold to the French king, the horse and the boy go through a lot of misfortunes and were handed over from one owner to another.  Half of the time in the hands of kind people, half of the time at the mercy of evil hands.  The boy is extremely passive and good-natured, and accepts his fate as it unfolds.  He doesn't seem to hold grudges against his tormentors, neither does he have strong emotions toward his losses.  But he's not weak or coward, either.  He has pretty good endurance toward hardships and knows how to move on.No one really punishes his tormentors, nor does he seek revenge on anybody.  The movie shows that there are good and evil in this world, and they come on our ways side by side, but that's what life is all about.  In this day and generation, justice must be done and to leave the wicked go unpunished is very frustrating, perhaps, but I think this movie has a good message there.The movie doesn't really get into the depth of the boy's struggles or the bond with the horse, and acting in general isn't that great (I was expecting it to be a tear-jerker, but it really wasn't).  I think some things can be improved, but I sort of like the way it is, its low-key approach, because it's not as threatening or emotionally traumatic for younger children.  Some characters die or get killed in the movie, but not like in the ways of dramatic, fancy killings of Hollywood movies.
