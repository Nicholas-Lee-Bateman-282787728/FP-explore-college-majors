In fact I can't wait for upcoming films like the next Resident Evil, the Bioshock movie, the Max Payne movie, the Metal Gear Solid movie, the Gears of War movie, and someday the Halo movie. Whoever made this movie mut have really loved the Hitman games, because a lot of love and care went into making this movie.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A genetically engineered assassin named Agent 47 goes around the world eliminating certain targets like other assassins and politicians by orders of an organization he works for. But when he's double-crossed on an assassination mission in Russia, he's determined to find out who set him up and eliminate the targets while protecting a woman who has ties to his target and trying to avoid capture from his pursuors.MUSIC: The score in this movie is quite good, and fits well with this film's theme and story.STORYLINE: Not the best story ever, but it does a fairly good job at pacing and plot twists.ACTION: Lots of gunplay, lots of blood, and even some sword fighting.ENTERTAINMENT: This movie is quite good, and definitely worth watching. It has an interesting storyline, awesome action, and great actors. Don't let kids watch it though, this is strictly for adults.OVERALL: There are a few roughspots in the story, and I did find the sword-fighting scene to be a little cheesy, but this movie is quite good for the most part.THE GOOD: Lots of blood, lots of gunplay, cool story, good pacing.THE BAD: Story has some problems, the sword-fighting scene was somewhat cheesy.",4,AN EXCEPTIONAL ACTION FLICK  8.75 OUT OF 10,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,1653,"['Thankfully', 'days', 'movies', 'based', 'games', 'are', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'now', 'Hitman', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'upcoming', 'films', 'next', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Bioshock', 'movie', 'Max', 'Payne', 'movie', 'Metal', 'Gear', 'Solid', 'movie', 'Gears', 'War', 'movie', 'Halo', 'movie', 'Whoever', 'made', 'movie', 'mut', 'have', 'really', 'loved', 'Hitman', 'games', 'lot', 'love', 'care', 'went', 'making', 'movie.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'assassin', 'named', 'Agent', '47', 'world', 'eliminating', 'certain', 'targets', 'other', 'assassins', 'politicians', 'orders', 'organization', 'when', 'double-crossed', 'assassination', 'mission', 'Russia', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'eliminate', 'targets', 'protecting', 'woman', 'who', 'ties', 'target', 'trying', 'avoid', 'capture', 'pursuors.MUSIC', 'score', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'fits', 'well', 'film', 'theme', 'story.STORYLINE', 'Not', 'best', 'story', 'ever', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'pacing', 'plot', 'twists.ACTION', 'Lots', 'gunplay', 'lots', 'blood', 'even', 'sword', 'fighting.ENTERTAINMENT', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'awesome', 'action', 'great', 'actors', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'strictly', 'adults.OVERALL', 'are', 'few', 'roughspots', 'story', 'did', 'find', 'sword-fighting', 'scene', 'be', 'little', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'part.THE', 'GOOD', 'Lots', 'blood', 'lots', 'gunplay', 'cool', 'story', 'good', 'pacing.THE', 'BAD', 'Story', 'problems', 'sword-fighting', 'scene', 'was', 'somewhat', 'cheesy']",N/A

Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[8, 10]","I actually had some expectations from this movie, I'm a big fan of the lower budget and simple action flick, and the trailer actually had me very interested. Let me also say that I don't play video games and even though I'm very well read this video-game just isn't popular enough for me to know much about, unlike say earlier adaptations like doom or Mario etc, or the coming Halo.The movie basically follows the formula take a popular video game, make it into a 100 min script, put in a decent actor, a hot exotic chick, and stuff it full of guns, explosions and a bunch of good one liners. Yet somehow this movie fell bellow my expectations, and I have a feeling the Censor Board had lot to do with, scene after scene of gratuitous violence and nudity fell pray to their hypocritical morality. So much so that even some of the dialogues that i saw in the teasers were butchered.Despite this fact there is no doubt that the film has its weakness' such as:1). Lack of a good villain, a staple of older movies nowadays its hard to come across a good one, a powerful hero needs a powerful hero to really shine.2). No really big scenes.3). Weak and much rehashed script, almost everything has been seen on film before.4). Timothy Oliphant? While I agree he does have charisma and did carry of his role quite well there is no doubt in my mind that it could have been much better, he was good in the cool parts, but he just didn't look menacing enough when he had too.Beside that, Olga looks smoking hot even with the punk look, when she dresses up she crosses over into the amazing territory, too bad the censor board cut of most of her hot scenes, but she was one of the best things about this movie. Some of the one liner are really good, especially good were the conversations between Olga and 47.

1139218,AXOCFP8G78JR4,B0012RLX7Y,Allen Yoakum,"[1, 1]",Hitman came out at the perfect time. It is a smart action movie film perfectly and acted just as well. The actor playing Hitman could've made him two dimensional given it came from a video game the story and all. But he didn't he made them human made him somebody you can care about even though he's a mass murderer. He's an antihero but yet he's a hero as well. You want them to succeed even though you know he's going to kill people and you want them to live. Hitman was put out by European movie company and it shows. But this is a good thing. The production value was top-notch and overall I would give it an 8.5 out of 10. But this is not a family movie this is a movie for people 15 and older. There's lots of violence swearing and nudity. This is to be expected considering the video game it was based on.

1139220,AK0CENM3LUM28,B0012RLX7Y,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","Hitman / B0012RLX88*Spoilers*""Hitman"" is an action movie at its core, and you'll find the usual pitfalls that most action shoot-em-up movies succumb to: an elaborate sword-fighting scene that feels more than a tiny bit unnecessary, blatant rip-offs ofThe Matrix, and a convoluted plot so tortured and forced that you can't help but feel sorry for the writers. But you know what, that's okay. Unnecessary melee scenes have become the modern version of an intermission for action movies - a relaxing break where you can collect your thoughts or visit the restroom. And ripping off ""The Matrix"" in an action movie is now like ripping offAliensin a horror movie - it's become almost impossible *not* to rip them off at least a little, just because they were so fundamentally good. And I can endure a nonsensical plot as long as you feed me enough ""oh, *that's* why...."" feelings to give me my amateur detective adrenaline rush.What I like most about ""Hitman"" is that the writers and directors approached the movie with uncharacteristic restraint, to the point that some scenes are almost artistic in their understated simplicity. Take the initial opening sequence where young 47 is shown as a child - most action movies would go whole hog with an expository voice-over longer thanWar and Peace, effectively killing the suspense and boring the user to tears, a la the unfortunateUltraviolet. But, no, ""Hitman"" resists temptation and keeps its mouth shut, providing us with a much more subtle and interesting opening hook.And take the shoe-horned love interest that is now mandatory for all movies to include - yes, it's the standard woman-who-doesn't-try-to-escape-the-dangerous-assassin-and-instead-rather-ridiculously-falls-in-love-with-him stereotype, but the writers were at least aware that the stereotype is patently ridiculous for your average, normal -kidnapped-by-an-assassin woman and so they instead introduced the facet that this particular woman has been regularly abused and brutalized for an extended time period now, making her seem less like an idiot for falling for a dangerous assassin and more like a particularly vulnerable woman grasping out at the first man who hasn't shown an inclination to sadistically torture her. At the end of the day, it's still the same stereotypical love interest, but at least now there's some semblance of a reason behind her actions, and I appreciate that little touch. This uncharacteristic restraint is also seen in the film ending, and while The Gift Ending is as predictable as the sun rising, they chose not to go whole hog with it and include a plot-impossible Happy Life Together Ending.For all its flaws, ""Hitman"" seems to counter them all with a charming sense of self-awareness. For instance, it is patently ridiculous that a secretive assassin would go about with a shaved head and a barcode tattoo - he stands out like a sore thumb wherever he goes. But the writers seem to REALIZE the idiocy of this and instead of trying to make us accept it, they just blatantly and openly ignore it, as if to say ""OK, we have to include the tattoo because it's in the video game, but all the characters are just going to pretend they don't see it,"" and frankly I like that approach - much more so than some kind of long, unbelievable explanation.So, all in all, I enjoyed ""Hitman"". It's an action movie and not a particularly thought-provoking one, but it is a fresh addition to a somewhat stagnant genre and while it plays it safe with the usual stereotypes and tropes, it does so with nice flourishes and artistic touches. It's not high art, but it is entertaining, and I'm happy to add it to my movie library.~ Ana Mardoll",4,"Entertaining, Surprisingly Restrained",1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,3671,"['Hitman', 'B0012RLX88*Spoilers*', 'Hitman', 'action', 'movie', 'core', ""'ll"", 'find', 'usual', 'pitfalls', 'most', 'action', 'shoot-em-up', 'movies', 'succumb', 'elaborate', 'sword-fighting', 'scene', 'more', 'tiny', 'bit', 'unnecessary', 'blatant', 'rip-offs', 'ofThe', 'Matrix', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'so', 'tortured', 'forced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'writers', 'know', 'what', 'okay', 'Unnecessary', 'melee', 'scenes', 'have', 'become', 'modern', 'version', 'intermission', 'action', 'movies', 'relaxing', 'break', 'where', 'can', 'collect', 'thoughts', 'visit', 'restroom', 'ripping', 'off', 'Matrix', 'action', 'movie', 'now', 'ripping', 'offAliensin', 'horror', 'movie', 'become', 'almost', 'impossible', '*not*', 'rip', 'off', 'least', 'little', 'just', 'were', 'so', 'fundamentally', 'good', 'can', 'endure', 'nonsensical', 'plot', 'as', 'long', 'feed', 'enough', 'oh', ""*that's*"", 'why', 'feelings', 'give', 'amateur', 'detective', 'adrenaline', 'rush.What', 'like', 'most', 'Hitman', 'writers', 'directors', 'approached', 'movie', 'uncharacteristic', 'restraint', 'point', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'artistic', 'understated', 'simplicity', 'Take', 'initial', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'young', '47', 'shown', 'child', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'would', 'go', 'whole', 'hog', 'expository', 'voice-over', 'longer', 'thanWar', 'Peace', 'effectively', 'killing', 'suspense', 'boring', 'user', 'tears', 'la', 'unfortunateUltraviolet', 'Hitman', 'temptation', 'mouth', 'shut', 'providing', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'interesting', 'opening', 'hook.And', 'take', 'shoe-horned', 'love', 'interest', 'now', 'mandatory', 'movies', 'include', 'yes', 'standard', ""woman-who-doesn't-try-to-escape-the-dangerous-assassin-and-instead-rather-ridiculously-falls-in-love-with-him"", 'stereotype', 'writers', 'were', 'least', 'aware', 'stereotype', 'patently', 'ridiculous', 'average', 'normal', '-kidnapped-by-an-assassin', 'woman', 'so', 'instead', 'introduced', 'facet', 'particular', 'woman', 'been', 'regularly', 'abused', 'brutalized', 'extended', 'time', 'period', 'now', 'making', 'seem', 'idiot', 'falling', 'dangerous', 'assassin', 'more', 'particularly', 'vulnerable', 'woman', 'grasping', 'out', 'first', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'shown', 'inclination', 'sadistically', 'torture', 'end', 'day', 'still', 'same', 'stereotypical', 'love', 'interest', 'least', 'now', 'semblance', 'reason', 'actions', 'appreciate', 'little', 'touch', 'uncharacteristic', 'restraint', 'also', 'seen', 'film', 'ending', 'Gift', 'Ending', 'as', 'predictable', 'sun', 'rising', 'chose', 'not', 'go', 'whole', 'hog', 'include', 'plot-impossible', 'Happy', 'Life', 'Together', 'Ending.For', 'flaws', 'Hitman', 'counter', 'charming', 'sense', 'self-awareness', 'instance', 'patently', 'ridiculous', 'secretive', 'assassin', 'would', 'go', 'shaved', 'head', 'barcode', 'tattoo', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'writers', 'seem', 'REALIZE', 'idiocy', 'instead', 'trying', 'make', 'accept', 'just', 'blatantly', 'openly', 'ignore', 'say', 'OK', 'have', 'include', 'tattoo', 'video', 'game', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'pretend', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'frankly', 'like', 'approach', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'kind', 'long', 'unbelievable', 'explanation.So', 'enjoyed', 'Hitman', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'thought-provoking', 'one', 'fresh', 'addition', 'somewhat', 'stagnant', 'genre', 'safe', 'usual', 'stereotypes', 'tropes', 'so', 'nice', 'flourishes', 'artistic', 'touches', 'not', 'high', 'art', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'happy', 'add', 'movie', 'library.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

It's actually pretty damn cool.Timothy Olyphant fits perfectly into the role of Agent 47, an orphan who is taken in and trained by an agency that trains children to be the most stealthy and deadly hitmen in the world. Agent 47 is the best of the best of all the Hitmen raised and trained by ""The Organization."" He is called in to perform on a hit on the Russian President Mikhail Belicoff, however the hit is a setup and 47 finds himself on the run from Interpol & The Russian Secret Police.While on the run, 47 endeavours to get revenge and find the truth about who set him up and why. This unravels a tangled web of lies and deceipt as one by one he kills those who have done him wrong, including those who are also members of ""The Organisation.""During his streak he comes across an unlikely companion in Nika Boronina who we come to see gives 47 emotions and feelings that he's never encountered before.This is a really good movie and something that at times keeps so close to the game that you come to think this is a game in itself. Timothy Olyphant plays 47 incredibly and although 47 is conventionally an emotionless character but within the movie we are given emotion that is being held back. That may be a bit of an oxymoron but the way in which Olyphant portrays it is amazing as it's a character that has all this emotion built up inside but is trying to hold it back.The action, dialogue and cinematography of this film I found to be incredibly intelligent. It has moments in it that you can identify to the game and there's one point in particular which the game itself is given a nod. 47 breaks through the window of a hotel room and it cuts to a vision of kids playing the video game hitman.Overall this was a very, very good film which I have to admit I didn't really have high hopes for in the beginning. I am glad to say my preconceptions were changed within the first 5 minutes into the movie and I am sure to watch it again.You should check it out whether you're a fan of the game or not, it's still a pretty special piece.",5,This Was Amazing,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,2118,"['Yet', 'game', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'one', 'major', 'difference', 'actually', 'pretty', 'damn', 'cool.Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Agent', '47', 'orphan', 'who', 'taken', 'trained', 'agency', 'children', 'be', 'most', 'stealthy', 'deadly', 'hitmen', 'world', 'Agent', '47', 'best', 'best', 'Hitmen', 'raised', 'trained', 'Organization', 'called', 'perform', 'hit', 'Russian', 'President', 'Mikhail', 'Belicoff', 'however', 'hit', 'setup', '47', 'finds', 'run', 'Interpol', 'Russian', 'Secret', 'Police.While', 'run', '47', 'endeavours', 'get', 'revenge', 'find', 'truth', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'why', 'tangled', 'web', 'lies', 'deceipt', 'one', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'wrong', 'including', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'members', 'Organisation', 'streak', 'unlikely', 'companion', 'Nika', 'Boronina', 'who', 'come', 'see', '47', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'never', 'encountered', 'before.This', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'something', 'times', 'keeps', 'so', 'close', 'game', 'come', 'think', 'game', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', '47', 'incredibly', '47', 'conventionally', 'emotionless', 'character', 'movie', 'are', 'given', 'emotion', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'oxymoron', 'way', 'Olyphant', 'amazing', 'character', 'emotion', 'built', 'up', 'inside', 'trying', 'hold', 'back.The', 'action', 'dialogue', 'cinematography', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'moments', 'can', 'identify', 'game', 'one', 'point', 'particular', 'game', 'given', 'nod', '47', 'breaks', 'window', 'hotel', 'room', 'vision', 'kids', 'playing', 'video', 'game', 'hitman.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'beginning', 'am', 'glad', 'say', 'preconceptions', 'were', 'changed', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'watch', 'again.You', 'should', 'check', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'game', 'not', 'still', 'pretty', 'special', 'piece']",N/A

Luster ""The Rook""","[4, 6]","Fans of the Hitman game, the movie ""Universal Soldier"", or the ""Dark Angel"" TV series should enjoy this fast moving action movie the most. ""Hitman"" focuses on a man who from childhood was raised in a school for assassins. We see glimpses throughout much like those glimpses in ""Dark Angel"" of a militaristic school of children learning to be super soldiers. They aren't even given a name, just a number and a bar code on the back of the head. I did think it odd that all these assassins go though the movie without bald head or bar code covered. It made them easy to spot and hence easier targets than if they grew hair or wore hats or a wig. I only mention this because most spies prefer to keep a low profile and I would think assassins would find that beneficial as well.Our hero has two things the other graduates don't seem to have, a little compassion and faultless execution. Although his compassion is only a flicker at first it grows as does his interest in a lady that was targeted to be eliminated, but was to be killed for other reasons than truthful ones. Hence he doesn't As our hero investigates instead of executing his orders to kill her, and he saves her instead. The addition of Interpol agents tracking his movements along with the activities of other criminal groups is a nice plus to the overall story. No one said this is Oscar material, but it has plenty of good action and the kind of James Bond type fun that most people will enjoy.

How can you not laugh at the idea of these super secret hitmen all having shaved heads and barcodes on the back of their skulls. I can never understand those who can't take a movie for what it is, and not for what they think it should be.Timothy Olyphant was great for the lead, and he meshed well with Olga Kurylenko. Speaking of her, I find it impossible not to be mesmerized by those beautiful but haunting slavic eyes. Why is it that those women's eyes can look so sad even when they are laughing?I was really pumped when I heard there is to be a sequel, but from the little info available it looks like Timothy Olyphant might not be in it. And I'd imagine Olga definitely won't be. Bummer, I'd love to see those two together again.Whenever I watch a movie like this I have the greatest urge to travel to Europe and see it for myself.

1139247,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0012RLX7Y,Chris Pandolfi,"[35, 44]","The oddest thing about ""Hitman"" is that it's enjoyable even though most of it doesn't work. There are moments of highly implausible action and completely inappropriate dialogue, both going to such extremes that watching the actors try to make something out of them is fascinating. At a certain point, I began to think that this film could still be effective without any sound accompanying the picture. It works much better as a visual spectacle, anyway; the artistry of the camerawork and the carefully choreographed shootout sequences completely overshadows anything the characters say, and this alone should tell you that there's absolutely nothing to get out of the story. For the life of me, I don't know why I'm recommending this movie, and I doubt that analyzing it will point to an explanation.The plot--what little of it there is--is surprisingly routine: a bald, tattooed assassin known only as Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) is hired to kill Russian president Mikhail Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), only to discover that he's been betrayed. Now the target of British and Russian Secret Police, Agent 47 treks across Europe on a quest for answers. With him is Nika Boronina (Olga Kurylenko), a Russian prostitute who was forced into this political conspiracy. For something adapted from a video game, this doesn't sound like an especially exciting plot. If anything, it sounds unflatteringly derivative. It doesn't help that pretty much nothing is adequately developed, especially when it comes to Agent 47. He does summarize his roots, stating that he was brought up by a secret agency known for breeding and training the world's best assassins. But that's about all we know; even flashback shots of teenagers having barcodes tattooed on the backs of their shaved heads doesn't tell us anything.One gets the sense that this barcode completely defines Agent 47, as if to remind him that his sole purpose is to kill, kill, kill. Or maybe his agency considers him nothing more than a product, and if his head doesn't scan properly at checkout, then he'll have to be replaced with someone better. Since no actual scanning happens in ""Hitman,"" I can't say for sure. I would have liked to see someone walk up to Agent 47 with a portable scanner--that would have been funny, funnier than any of the unintentionally funny moments this film had to offer. Most of these involve Agent 47 and Nika, whose conversations are so badly written that they border on campy. Nika herself is a bit of an anomaly, since she lacks the emotional gray area between Uncontrollably Weepy and Boldly Seductive. Her sexual advances are flatly rejected; his murdering skills are top notch, but his romantic skills are another story altogether.This makes Agent 47 the biggest anomaly of all. His voice is soft yet demanding, as if he idolized Clint Eastwood and wanted to become him. But stranger than that is the way Agent 47 looks--his bald, tattooed head and impeccable taste in fashion make him oddly conspicuous for an assassin. Isn't he supposed to be a ghost, someone who can get the job done and disappear without leaving a behind trace? He's apparently not good enough to escape the watchful eye of Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott), an agent for a sect of the British Secret Police called Interpol. Agent 47 also attracts the attention of Yuri Marklov (Robert Knepper), who works for a Russian agency called the FSB (I have no idea what that stands for). As both men get closer to Agent 47, they find themselves foiled time and time again with yet another daring escape, which inevitably involves a series of cool daredevil stunts.I'm making this movie seem ridiculous because it is ridiculous. But as I said earlier, the story is not what drives ""Hitman."" It's all about the way it looks, about how clever the camera angles can be made and how far over the top the stunts can go. It's also about silly dialogue. Consider this moment between Agent 47 and three other assassins with barcode tattoos: they start by pointing guns at each other, but they drop them when Agent 47 says, ""How about dying with a little dignity?"" They all nod in agreement, after which they pull swords from under their jackets and begin attacking each other. There's also Nika's line, ""You know, you're really quite charming when you're not killing people."" I'd like to think that such lines were written for satirical purposes, but considering how seriously the film takes itself, that probably wasn't the case.I'm now realizing how bizarre this review was, and I'm sorry it had to be that way. ""Hitman"" is shallow eye candy with an incredibly weak story, yet I'm recommending it because it accomplished quite a lot in its weakness. I certainly liked the stunt work, such as when a barefoot Agent 47 leaps from the balcony of an exploding hotel room and crashes through a window on a lower floor. I enjoyed the conversations between Olyphant and Kurylenko, probably because they were laughably unconvincing. For all I know, maybe they were meant to be that way. But most of all, I enjoyed what I was looking at; the cinematography is surprisingly good, and it gets even better when coupled with the action and the special effects. I know it's crazy to say all this, but since ""Hitman"" is a crazy film, it's probably just as well.",4,Assassin for Hire,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,5284,"['oddest', 'thing', 'Hitman', 'enjoyable',

Thus we find Timothy Olyphant in this 2007 films called ""The Hitman"" in which a highly skilled assassin is betrayed and hunted by his own organization. The talented Olyphant comes to the role in between doning the sheriff's hat in 2004 for ""Deadwood"" and again in 2010 for ""Justified"".Hitman gives us all the action and fast paced killing that we're accustomed to seeing in films like this. It's directed by relatively unknown Xavier Gens, but its look and feel can perhaps best be explained by looking at the film's producers - famed action director Luc Besson (""The Professional"", ""The Last Battle"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""La Femme Nikita"") and action star Vin Diesel (""The Fast and the Furious"", ""XXX"", ""The Chronicles of Riddick""). BTW - Diesel was originally scheduled to play the part of the Hitman, and then it was offered to Jason Stratham before Olyphant came on board.The real treats in ""The Hitman"" are Olga Kurylenko as the love interest and Dougray Scott as the Interpol agent who is hunting Olyphant.This was Kurylanko's first American film and she is stunning - sexy, vulnerable, and cute at the same time. Since this film she has appeared in several others including ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) and ""Centurion"" (2010) and played the title role in ""The Assassin Next Door"" (2009).Dougray Scott is perhaps best known for his co-starring role in ""MI 2"" although TV viewers may recognize him from his recurring role as Ian in ""Desparate Housewives"" (2006-7).Fans of the betrayed assassin genre will enjoy this film.

A couple plot complications and a beautiful, half-naked woman get tossed in for good measure...but, you're not here for plot. It's all about Agent 47 getting the job done, staying a step ahead of everyone else.The movie's pretty stylish and goes around to a number of locations in Europe (two of the biggest draws for the game itself). The girl's pretty good looking, the action is fun if a bit absurd at times (c'mon, swords?), but nothing beats how great it looks when you see Agent 47 in profile pull up behind the body guard of his target or watching him pull on the uniform of a rail employee and ""blending in"" like a bald guy with a barcode tattoo on his head can...it's the combination of stylish visuals and the ridiculous skill Agent 47 has at doing what he does that makes the movie worth watching.Now, I can't say this is some sort of heady masterpiece and no, he's not James Bond, but this is definitely a fun movie and is likely a must for anyone who's enjoyed the games. They could have cast Agent 47 better (sorry, while Timothy Olyphant does a decent job he's not the guy...I groaned when I first saw them reveal him as 47 in a trailer...). Thus the one star off.For everyone else, I suggest renting this sucker first.

My mistake.First of all, in the other films that I've seen Olyphant in, his character always has this dry sense of humor that adds a little flare to the mood of the scene that he's acting out, yet HITMAN never gave him that opportunity -- not even in the closing scene, which appeared to be a unbelievably lame attempt at incorporating the dry humor.  In my humble opinion, this particular role was far too serious for Olyphant and there were a number of times where he looked as if he were going to say something sarcastic but it was always followed up by either silence or some overly serious threat or comment.So, I'm going to rely on the fact that I'm skeptical of movies inspired by videogames and trust my hunch rather than go out on a limb and waste my time.

The answer to this quote, according to 47, will decide whether he kills Mike, or not.  And thus, our movie continues on how we get to this point in the movie.HITMAN, based on video game released in 2000, was an enjoyable, action-packed film from the start.  Agent 47 is contracted by his employers, the Organization, to assassinate the Russian President, Mikhail Belicoff.  47 pulls off the kill, only to learn later that he has been double-crossed by someone.  He kidnaps Belicoff's girlfriend, Nika, and attempts to discover who set him up.Timothy Olyphant does a great job of portraying a slick professional killer with a cold sense of humor.  In one scene, while being seduced by Nika, instead of ""giving in"", he knocks her out with a tranquilizer.  Classic!  Dougray Scott is 47's nemesis, a Interpol inspector who has been hunting him for 3 years.  Robert Knepper (from Prison Break,T-bag) plays a Russian FSB agent, who also hunts after 47.  I found it hard to believe him as a Russian, considering the Southern convict he plays on Prison Break.  And I swear, I heard a Russian/Southern accent on a couple of his conversations.The stunts are typical action movie fare, with nothing new.  However, as mentioned before, the fight scene between 47 and 3 other Organization agents was very entertaining.  There is also a great action scene with Udre Belicoff, who is Mikhail's drug runner brother.  Udre is played by Henry Ian Cusick from Lost.DVD Extra's:*  2 Previews of AVP:Requiem and Live Free or Die Hard*  ""In the Crosshairs: The Making of Hitman"" : interesting take on the process of how to transition the video game to film.*  ""Digital Hits"": describing the video game, Hitman.*  ""Instruments of Destruction"": shows the different weapons that are used in the movie.

I LOVE action flicks, but something about this one said ""rent, don't buy.""  That turned out to be a good choice.  The plot is pretty basic: assassin is hired for a job then the client tries to kock him off.  And don't forget a cop (here an Interpol agent) chasing the hitman.  That works for me.  I didn't even mind the ""Dark Angel"" rip-off of kids being raised as killers and branded with bar codes!  Heck, I enjoyed ""Doom,"" so I was ready to jump on board.  The effects were good, there was lots of hand-to-hand combat, guns blazing and mysterious characters (I kept waiting for ""cigarette man"" to make an appearance).  I thought Dougray Scott played the Interpol agent well, and I was actually surprised at how good the eye candy prostitute turned out to be as a character.  However, I just did not like Timothy Olyphant as the Hitman.  He just did not work.In the video game, Hitman is an amoral assassin.  Neither good nor evil, just doing his job never matter that it happens to be assassination.  The character is dispassionate and unruffled.  Olyphant came across as wooden - like he was reading his lines off a cue card even in the middle of a battle.  I can't recall seeing him in anything else, so I'm not sure if he's a poor actor, or just in this role.  Instead of being cool and collected, he seemed almost mentally challenged.  And I don't mean that to be sarcastic or demeaning. The producers also chose to make him socially inept, which seemed out of place in a professional hitman who may have to blend in to escape or to get information.  I would have preferred Karl Urban, Jason Statham, or even Vin Diesel in the main role.Overall, this was a good but not great movie.  It was worth seeing, but I wouldn't rewatch it.

Plus although I'm a Timothy Olyphant fan I think he's better as the scummy low lives he played in earlier films. Here he doesn't really know how to approuch playing Agent 47. He's often dry but he tries to at least give him a sense of humor in some scenes. But he's even emotionless when he uses humor.Olyphant at least looks the part though and does handle the action well and looks cool with a gun lol. Dougray Scott (Mission Impossible 2) pretty much owns the film though as an agent who's on 47's tail. Prison Break's under-rated actor Robert Knepper fairs well also. Plus Olga Kurylenko is pretty sexy as Agent 47's love interest and I have no idea how he manages to not even touch her once lol.Hitman, don't get me wrong isn't a great movie but it's a guilty pleasure. It offers some decent action and is sort of better made than most video game based movies. It's way better than the Tomb Raider movies for instance. If Olyphant is signed on for sequels though, he needs to some how figure out how to give a better performance. It would help if he had some better lines to work with next time though. He basically gets to use dull one liners when ever he shoots someone so he doesn't have the best material to work with.

I went to see it originally because the commercials and previews looked good. Let me first say I've never played the games the movies are based off of, so I had no expectations about the movie.  I recently had to watch it again at a friends house to my horror.Ok now onto the movie. First lets start with the story/characters. The story was incoherent mess with no real back story, and no main story what so ever. On a side note did anyone notice the beginning scenes. They were scenes from DARK ANGEL. The back story was a copy of DARK ANGEL. DARK ANGEL came out in 1999, I'm not sure when Hitman first came out, but I'm sure it was after 1999. Ok back to topic, with there being no story it left the characters with nothing, no personality, nothing to draw you into their lives. Next we have the Action/special effects which was the best part of this bad movie. Still it was nothing new, or nothing that separates it from all the other average action movies out there.Finally the music, or lack of any to add depth to the movie. I don't think I heard any at all.Overall a below average action movie. I can't believe I wasted $7.00 going to see this movie, and was stuck watching it again at a friends house. Don't waste any money on this movie.  When I first saw it at the theater, the previews were better than the movie. I AM LEGEND, IRON MAN, the new Will Ferral movie, and JUMPER. They were all better than this movie.Why can't movie studio's make a good movie based off a video game, is it really that hard.

1139294,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B0012RLX7Y,Joe Carugati,"[2, 4]","Films based off video games are usually not that wonderful.  They either range from good (""Resident Evil,"" ""Silent Hill"") to mediocre (""Doom,"" ""Tomb Raider"") to awful (""House of the Dead,"" ""Bloodrayne"").  Director Xavier Gens' ""Hitman"" falls somewhere in between good and mediocre.  It's got solid action scenes and a great look, but not much direction or cohesion when it comes to the storyline.Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) was trained as a young boy by the Organization to kill when needed.  In Eastern Europe, he's hired to assassinate the Russian president, which he does successfully, only to see him reappear on the television with only a minor wound on his head.  With Interpol and the Russian military at his heels, he also has to deal with the Organization setting him up and trying to kill him as well as taking care of Nika (Olga Kurylenko), a girl who's being chased as well for similar reasons.I'm a fan of the ""Hitman"" games, mainly because its game play is different compared to others.  It's not a game where running and gunning is encouraged.  Instead, the focus is more on strategy and the different ways you can go about assassinating targets to make it look like it was either an accident or just a very clean shot.  Since the video game series is unique compared to others, I was hoping to say the same for the film.  Unfortunately, I could not, but that doesn't mean it was a terrible experience at all.The main problem I had with the film is that the plot was too complex.  After watching it twice, I still didn't quite grasp what was going on, who certain people were, and why some action scenes occurred (all about the Metro scene).  At one point, I would think I would understand what was going on only to be confused five minutes later.  Furthermore, the film is titled ""Hitman,"" but it could have also been ""Hitman and the Interpol Investigation"".  Too much time is devoted to the head of the investigation, Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott), when it should be focused more on 47, especially his background, and his relationship with Nika (which I never quite understood where that was going either).  Finally, there are too many characters in the story that are not needed or that could use some fleshing out (Agent Smith, Udre Belicoff).  They are crucial to the plot, but since the viewer doesn't know much about them, it never really makes sense what they are doing or how they are affecting everything.The acting was above par for this type of film.  When Timothy Olyphant was announced to play 47, I remember fan boys crying out against it.  Even though I would have preferred somebody else (not Vin Diesel though), he still did a fine job, but I wasn't that pleased on how the character acted in the film (I'll get to this later).  Dougray Scott, probably best known as the bad guy in ""Mission: Impossible II,"" was great as the Interpol agent.  Some of his scenes could have been cut to leave more room for 47's story, but he was still enjoyable and balanced out the film nicely with his demeanor compared to 47's.  Olga Kurylenko looks great, but her acting didn't do much for me.  Her chemistry with Olyphant was unconvincing and not truly believable.  Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond from ""LOST"") showed up and was wasted in his role as Udre Belicoff.  It was great to see him in something else, but the film never did anything with his character and it was disappointing.The film, directed by Xavier Gens, does have a great look about it.  The locations from the train station to a church to even a bathroom all look beautiful.  He also knows how to shoot action well and keeps the film moving at a brisk pace.If a film is called ""Hitman,"" people are probably going to watch just for the action, which is delivered in spades and is the highlight of the film.  They are all shot fine and do not contain any ""shaky-cam"" or quick cutting which was much appreciated by me, but they lacked something.  Many of the action sequences just seemed to happen for no reason either then to showcase some violence.  Unlike the ""Bourne"" films, where the action has a purpose, it's not really the case here.  Also, I stated earlier that the games pushed for more strategy than just blowing everything away.  In the film, it's the opposite way around and it eventually becomes a mindless action film.  I was praying to have a creative assassination played out in true ""Hitman"" style, but I never got that either.Finally, my biggest gripe with the film is how our main character, Agent 47, is written.  In the film, he has a range of emotions, which for me, was a problem.  In the game, he was always serious with a rare, but dark sense of humor.  He would seem surreal in the game and above being a human.  The film changes that and makes him more realistic and like any other individual that takes away his unique personality.  I wanted to see more brooding and less talking and smiling.Overall, ""Hitman"" is an above mediocre film based off a video game.  It doesn't do justice to the already amazing game and it's unfortunate.  Still, it packs a few solid action scenes, great cinematography, and some good acting.  If only the plot had been stronger and the character of 47 better written, this film would have been surprisingly awesome.",3,Hitman,1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,5251,"['Films', 'based', 'off',

Speaking from the viewpoint of a video game aficionado I am somewhat particular when it comes to my beloved games being adapted into feature films. For the most part Hollywood has done a decent job of delivering their versions of these iconic video game characters without straying too far from the source material. The most successful video game to movie entries would be the `Resident Evil' series starring Milla Jovovich, closely followed by Angelina Jolie's turn as the voluptuous vixen Lara Croft in the two `Tomb Raider' films. Most recently Hollywood has turned to yet another video game character for inspiration, but this character comes from quite a different world than that of the previous two adaptations. Simply known as Agent 47, the title character in the acclaimed `Hitman' franchise, gives gamers the opportunity to become one of the world's most premier assassins as they carry out hit after hit for the highest bidder. Now that Hollywood has taken notice of this silent, but deadly anti-hero, does his adaptation live up to the spirit of the video game or is this one adaptation that needs to be executed before it can do any more damage?""Hitman"" follows the deadly assassin known simply as 47 (Timothy Olyphant) as he silently, and efficiently eliminates any target he is assigned. He is the best at what he does, but when he is betrayed on a high-profile mission to assassinate a public figure, 47 finds himself on the run from the very people he works for as the remainder of their highly trained assassins are in hot pursuit. As if this wasn't enough for 47 to be concerned with, he is being relentlessly pursued by an Interpol agent (Dougray Scott) while trying to protect a beautiful woman (Olga Kurylenko), who has inadvertently found herself trapped in the middle of this deadly pursuit.This is an odd movie for me, in terms of what my opinion was for it. On the one hand, I found it to be a moderately enjoyable, yet flawed video game adaptation that grasped the essence of the game (including some of the distinct visual imagery of 47 in action). Yet, on the other hand I found the lead character of 47 to be somewhat mis-cast which was a little distracting. Softer spoken Timothy Olyphant is a solid actor; however, I don't believe he was the best choice to play the much deeper voiced assassin. Also, the story felt a bit thin in some places and in other places as the betrayal of 47 unfolds the story seemed to become more contrived and convoluted, as if the writers seemed unsure of their end result leading to an unfocused second half for the film. Overall, the story remained paper thin, seeming to serve no other purpose than to lead the audience along from fight to fight until we reach the inevitable overblown, guns blazing conclusion.The acting was decent, though by no means stellar from any member of the cast. Timothy Olyphant (""Live Free or Die Hard"") was adequate in his portrayal as the stalwart assassin 47, but he seemed somewhat uncomfortable in the role at times, appearing less confident than the character should be, but leading up to and during the numerous action sequences Olyphant was spot-on as the murderous 47. The supporting cast was average at best, and was led by Dougray Scott (""Mission: Impossible 2""), who was forgettable in his role as the Interpol agent pursuing 47, seeming to basically phone in his performance. If his performance in ""Hitman"" is any indication of what believes to be good acting, then I'm not too surprised that I haven't seen him in anything of real note since his villainous turn as the main antagonist in ""Mission: Impossible 2"". The last supporting cast member worth mentioning was newcomer, and soon-to-be Bond girl in ""007: Quantum of Solace"", Olga Kurylenko who did a good job of vamping it up for the camera as a temptress for the chaste 47, as she tries in vain to seduce him with her numerous sexual advances. Though her performance wasn't Oscar worthy, it was merely decent in my opinion; she apparently must have done something right, either in this movie or in an audition later on, to catch the attention of the creative forces behind the James Bond franchise. Whatever the case may be, I think Olga's going to have to up her acting game if she expects to convincingly hold her own against the capable talents of Daniel Craig and Judi Dench in the next `007' film. Olga's performance in ""Hitman"" did fit in with the rest of the cast as being merely average, yet unremarkable and from what I saw there wasn't much in this movie that would entice me to see her in any other films.The primary drive, and cause for most of my disappointment, for ""Hitman"" was the vast amount of action sequences that were generally entertaining to watch, yet didn't really seem to stand out as anything we haven't seen before from other entries in the action film genre. The problem for ""Hitman"" was not a lack of action, but maybe an over-reliance on action to the point that the story seemed to be an afterthought for the writers and French director Xavier Gens, serving merely as a means to get 47 from one fight to another with not much substance in between. This is a real shame as the video games feature a rather involved, well-written storyline that holds your interest and works hand-in-hand with the action of the game to keep things moving along for the person playing the game, without feeling like lines of dialogue strung together to hold us over until the next fight. Shame on the writers for not coming up with a better story that would have fully lived up to the standards set forth by the various games that comprise this beloved video game franchise.""Hitman"" is not a great movie, in fact at times I found it to be somewhat boring and by the numbers, yet it was a decent action film with some impressive action sequences throughout the duration to grab your attention after boring you with insipid lines of dialogue between gun fights.""Hitman"" is available in rated R and unrated editions both contain violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.",3,"Silent,

1139300,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B0012RLX7Y,- Kasia S.,"[107, 118]","I didn't expect to be impressed with this movie because in my mind it was simply another flick made from a video game but man, I was blown away! In fact it was so enjoyable that ten minutes after finishing it I wanted to see it again, and that rarely happens. Never mind the few geographical errors, this movie is all action and there is no waste of precious minutes on mindless love scenes - the one actually has one cut short by the main hero and it was humorous, how he was all business, him being this monk killer for hire who lives a chaste life. In a way it was like a James Bond character who actually didn't try to bed all the babes, impressive. And Timothy Olyphant was flawless, even thought I prefer men with longer hair he looked cool and totally acted the part, mysterious, brooding but with a heart in there somewhere.Bald and serious, dressed in an expensive suit, red silk tie and an impeccably crisp white shirt the Hitman is a force to be reckoned with. He's not too emotional but rather straightforward with a little bit of a charm threw in as he works his meticulously planned hits until one day everything changes. In a very short time the predator turns into juicy prey and he must use all of his killer skills to catch the bad guys. Trouble is finding out who the bad guys are, I liked watching this movie without knowing anything about it, but I will just say it involved the Russian secret police and the Interpol chasing the Hitman while someone from the inside of his secret agency was trying to put him in the harm's way.

The most interesting part of the film is how Agent 47 has NO experience with women.

Timothy Olyphant who was on the TV series ""Deadwood"" shines in the center spotlight in this film.  You can tell that inside the ultra-disciplined assassin lies a human being.Danish actor Ulrich Thomsen plays Bellicoff with a good journeyman performance.  Dougray Scott from ""Mission Impossible 2"" was also excellent as Mike Whittier the British agent that keeps on the trail.I liked the unexpected twists in the plot such as having the Russians be ordered to assassinate their own leader.

I sat through this mvoie with my jaw dropped because I couldn't believe how, how....  Let me start with the opennig credits.  They set up these kids with tattoos and all their training and that is it.  The mvoie never goes back and fills in the history of the main character.

The Hitman and three other hitmen[see confused already]face each other with guns draw and ..get this.. each hitman has his gun pointed at every other other hitman.  Now the main Hitman says something about honorable death and every hitman drops his gun.  NOW three of the hitmen who were pointing their guns at each other join up and fight the Hitman with swords they draw out from under the back of their coats.  I have to stop and read what I just wrote to see if I am lost and ..nope I am not lost.  The next action scene that is so stupid is shootout with the actor from LOST, Desmon.  Everyone here graps two machine guns, one for each hand and starts blasting away.  The funny part is the Hitman is firing these machine guns one handed and the guns are not moving up and down with the recoil.  Next Desmon has two 20 lbs M60 machine guns, one in each hand blasting away and no spent shell casing flying anywhere. Blasting of the bishop's office by the helicopter gun ship is hiliarious.

Having this one assassin never close to getting caught as he wanders around the world with a bald head and a bar code tattooed on the back of it was too much to swallow.  Even a mild attempt at disguising himself would have helped.  Then to have six bald guys with bar codes tattooed on the back of their heads roaming around a train station without being detected by crack Interpol agents or top secret Russian policemen was a bit much.Perhaps, watching Shoot `Em with Clive Owen first was the problem.  That film had a remarkable villain in Paul Giamatti.  This movie had an evil Russian agent with an evil government double.

1139316,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0012RLX7Y,Mark Turner,"[4, 4]","HITMAN releases this week to DVD, transferring the top rated electronic game from the big screen and back to the small screen. The game revolves around a genetically engineered killer for hire and the film doesn't stray from that successful formula.Timothy Olyphant (last seen in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD) stars as Agent 47, the same genetically engineered assassin spawned in the game series. Hired out by an unknown group known only as the Agency, his latest target is the top runner in free elections in Russia. After having completed a head shot from miles away, he is stunned to see the same man on television having survived. He's shocked once more when an attempt on his own life is made.The bait used in the attempt on his life is one Nika Boronina (Olga Kuryenko), the mistress of the same politician. Knowing that she is the only living connection between the two of them, 47 takes her into his protection and begins to try and unravel just who is working for whom.With both the Russian secret police and a stalwart INTERPOL agent (Dougray Scott) on his trail, 47 follows the clues and fights off his attackers. When these assassins turn out to be the same genetically altered killers as 47, he takes them out one by one, making sure that those who are guilty of turning against him are made to pay.This is a movie made for action junkies. While there is plenty of plot to keep your interest, it relies more on the visual tapestry of violence to hold you in its grip. There is an almost ballet like form exhibited by 47 as he uses dual side arms to take out his opponents as well as physical skills that are just short of a Jet Li film.Along with the action is subtle humor and well played acting skills from all involved. Being taken from a video game, it would be hard to play this one as serious and carry it out, but that is indeed what happens. It is rare that a game transfers to film well (check out the horrendous HOUSE OF THE DEAD as a bad example), but when it happens like this, it gives game fans hope that more is set to come. I for one would love to see what becomes next of Agent 47 and you may too after watching this one.While this review seems short, what more can be said about a high octane, testosterone filled, pump up the action flick? This is one of those movies where though it may have a plot, it gets enough attention to hold the film together on the side, instead focusing on the adrenaline inducing atmosphere that IS the world of the main character. He comes off as cold, cruel and calculating, but that is to be expected of someone in this line of work. It's what makes the movie as well as the games work on several different levels.

1139321,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0012RLX7Y,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 3]","Quick, what movie involves a bald killer who always wears a suit, adheres to a strict code, and picks up an exotic European damsel in distress while being hunted by a shadowy organization? No, not Transporter 3...Hitman!Hitman was a videogame first.  It was unique because the game play involved killing targets in unconventional ways.  The more mundane the kill (dying from a heart attack, falling out a window, etc.) the more points the player gained.  Going beyond the First-Person Shooter genre, it was a First-Person Killer. Even then, Hitman was less about doing hits and more about assassinating targets.  The term ""hitman"" is far too mundane for a game of this nature.The movie takes assassination to new levels. Agent 47 (Timothy Oliphant) is a genetically engineered clone trained only to kill.  We know he's a clone because of the bar code on the back of his bald head, which the director (Xavier Gens) films at every opportunity.  Considering Agent 47 seems to stand out in a crowd, you'd think he would wear a wig.  But Agent 47 only dons disguises as a means to an end - there's no deep undercover work here.47 is wanted for a botched murder attempt of Russian President Mikhail Belicoff. His nemesis, an Interpol agent hot on 47's trail, is Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott, nearly incomprehensible with his accent). Whittier's nemesis in turn is Yuri Marklov (Robert Knepper), a Soviet secret service agent who has the home turf advantage. Along the way, 47 picks up a prostitute (Olga Kurylenko as Nika Boronina) with a heart of gold.Thing is, Agent 47 doesn't miss. It's made clear in the introduction and conclusion that 47 is supremely confident, capable, and seven steps of ahead of everyone else...including the audience.  As a result, there's never any concern that he's in danger.  He's more a force of nature that is weathered rather than defeated.  He's that good.  And unfortunately, that makes him very boring.Knepper is suitably menacing and Kurylenko manages to be both sultry and innocent at the same time.  But the character of Whittier is woefully out of his league and Oliphant plays 47 as a cipher, a killing machine that shows only the slightest glimmer of interest in a grateful prostitute who doesn't wear panties.It's possible to create a film about a killer so dangerous that he's never in any real danger.  The key is giving him other vulnerabilities: family, friends, colleagues.  Equilibrium is a shining example of this style of movie done right. All violence without any of the icky intimacy, Hitman hits the action movie notes but with none of the pathos.But it's still better than Transporter 3.",2,"All hits, no misses",1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2638,"['Quick', 'what', 'movie', 'bald', 'killer', 'who', 'always', 'suit', 'strict', 'code', 'up', 'exotic', 'European', 'damsel', 'distress', 'being', 'hunted', 'shadowy', 'organization', 'No', 'not', 'Transporter', '3', 'Hitman', 'Hitman', 'was', 'videogame', 'first', 'was', 'unique', 'game', 'play', 'involved', 'killing', 'targets', 'unconventional', 'ways', 'more', 'mundane', 'kill', 'dying', 'heart', 'attack', 'falling', 'out', 'window', 'etc', 'more', 'points', 'player', 'gained', 'Going', 'First-Person', 'Shooter', 'genre', 'was', 'First-Person', 'Killer', 'Even', 'then', 'Hitman', 'was', 'less', 'doing', 'hits', 'more', 'assassinating', 'targets', 'term', 'hitman', 'far', 'too', 'mundane', 'game', 'nature.The', 'movie', 'assassination', 'new', 'levels', 'Agent', '47', 'Timothy', 'Oliphant', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'clone', 'trained', 'only', 'kill', 'know', 'clone', 'bar', 'code', 'back', 'bald', 'head', 'director', 'Xavier', 'Gens', 'films', 'opportunity', 'Considering', 'Agent', '47', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'wear', 'wig', 'Agent', '47', 'only', 'dons', 'means', 'end', 'deep', 'undercover', 'work', 'here.47', 'wanted', 'botched', 'murder', 'attempt', 'Russian', 'President', 'Mikhail', 'Belicoff', 'nemesis', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'hot', '47', 'trail', 'Mike', 'Whittier', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'nearly', 'incomprehensible', 'accent', 'Whittier', 'nemesis', 'turn', 'Yuri', 'Marklov', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'Soviet', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'who', 'home', 'turf', 'advantage', 'way', '47', 'picks', 'prostitute', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'Nika', 'Boronina', 'heart', 'gold.Thing', 'Agent', '47', ""n't"", 'miss', 'made', 'clear', 'introduction', 'conclusion', '47', 'supremely', 'confident', 'capable', 'seven', 'steps', 'ahead', 'everyone', 'else', 'including', 'audience', 'result', 'never', 'concern', 'danger', 'more', 'force', 'nature', 'weathered', 'rather', 'defeated', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'boring.Knepper', 'suitably', 'menacing', 'Kurylenko', 'be', 'sultry', 'innocent', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'Whittier', 'woefully', 'league', 'Oliphant', '47', 'cipher', 'killing', 'machine', 'only', 'slightest', 'glimmer', 'interest', 'grateful', 'prostitute', 'who', ""n't"", 'wear', 'panties.It', 'possible', 'create', 'film', 'killer', 'so', 'dangerous', 'never', 'real', 'danger', 'key', 'giving', 'other', 'vulnerabilities', 'family', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'Equilibrium', 'shining', 'example', 'style', 'movie', 'done', 'right', 'violence', 'icky', 'intimacy', 'Hitman', 'action', 'movie', 'notes', 'none', 'pathos.But', 'still', 'better', 'Transporter', '3']",N/A

1139324,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B0012RLX7Y,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 4]","In a world of Uwe Bolls and other listless directors, it seems the only qualification for making a passable ""video game movie"" is making sure that it doesn't suck completely. Good examples of this are found in the ""Tomb Raider"" series and the ""Resident Evil"" sequels, and also in ""Hitman"" - adaptation of the game of the same name, directed by Xavier Gens and starring Timothy Olyphant (""Live Free or Die Hard""). While competent enough, however, ""Hitman"" wallows in the mediocrity of the modern action genre, with its storyline and action easily eclipsed by recent hits like ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" and ""Casino Royale"", leaving it to appeal only to fans of the game series and viewers who like bald men.I haven't played the games, so I won't bother arguing about the faithfulness (or lack of) in adaptation, but here's the plot: Agent 47 (Olyphant) is an ace assassin-for-hire trained by a secret agency that specializes in political murder. After being set up for the murder of a corrupt Russian politician (Ulrich Thomsen, ""The Inheritance""), 47 is hounded by both Russian secret service and British Interpol as he attempts to uncover who double-crossed him.The film attempts to hold your attention by moving along at a brisk pace, but it lacks the constant intrigue that would prevent you from noticing its flaws. First of all, the action is not all that good: the frequent gunfights and couple of hand-to-hand encounters lack both originality and pacing. While the acting is passable, I wish I knew who thought it would be a good idea to pick Tim Olyphant as the star: like I said, I've never played the games, but seeing the character on the case of the second instalment in the video store I frequent is enough to make we question the casting. Olyphant looks like a male model next to the stony-faced killer on the cover of the game. In addition, attempts to make his character sympathetic should've been excluded: roughing up and locking women in the trunk of his car is fine, but when the same woman (Olga Kurylenko) falls for him, I start to question the mindset of the script writer.The film is less about assassination than it is about Agent 47 running from folks who want to catch him, so perhaps ""Hitman"" should've waited until a script better suited to the title of the film came around. What we have here is a run-of-the-mill attempt at adaptation that managed to find an audience but falls short of having any and all re-watch value. If you're like me, you'll want to see it simply because it's based on a game, but don't fork over the $15 for a purchase before you've given it a rent.",2,Missed Target,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,2600,"['world', 'Uwe', 'Bolls', 'other', 'listless', 'directors', 'only', 'qualification', 'making', 'passable', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'making', 'sure', ""n't"", 'suck', 'completely', 'Good', 'examples', 'are', 'found', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'series', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'sequels', 'also', 'Hitman', 'adaptation', 'game', 'same', 'name', 'directed', 'Xavier', 'Gens', 'starring', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'competent', 'enough', 'however', 'Hitman', 'mediocrity', 'modern', 'action', 'genre', 'storyline', 'action', 'easily', 'eclipsed', 'recent', 'hits', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'leaving', 'appeal', 'only', 'fans', 'game', 'series', 'viewers', 'who', 'like', 'bald', 'men.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'games', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'arguing', 'faithfulness', 'lack', 'adaptation', 'here', 'plot', 'Agent', '47', 'Olyphant', 'ace', 'assassin-for-hire', 'trained', 'secret', 'agency', 'political', 'murder', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'murder', 'corrupt', 'Russian', 'politician', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'Inheritance', '47', 'hounded', 'Russian', 'secret', 'service', 'British', 'Interpol', 'uncover', 'who', 'double-crossed', 'him.The', 'film', 'attempts', 'hold', 'attention', 'moving', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'constant', 'intrigue', 'would', 'prevent', 'noticing', 'flaws', 'First', 'all', 'action', 'not', 'good', 'frequent', 'gunfights', 'couple', 'hand-to-hand', 'encounters', 'lack', 'originality', 'pacing', 'acting', 'passable', 'wish', 'knew', 'who', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'pick', 'Tim', 'Olyphant', 'star', 'said', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'games', 'seeing', 'character', 'case', 'second', 'instalment', 'video', 'store', 'frequent', 'enough', 'make', 'question', 'casting', 'Olyphant', 'male', 'model', 'stony-faced', 'killer', 'cover', 'game', 'addition', 'attempts', 'make', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'excluded', 'roughing', 'up', 'locking', 'women', 'trunk', 'car', 'fine', 'when', 'same', 'woman', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'start', 'question', 'mindset', 'script', 'writer.The', 'film', 'less', 'assassination', 'Agent', '47', 'running', 'folks', 'who', 'want', 'catch', 'so', 'perhaps', 'Hitman', 'should', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'script', 'better', 'suited', 'title', 'film', 'came', 'around', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'run-of-the-mill', 'attempt', 'adaptation', 'managed', 'find', 'audience', 'short', 'having', 're-watch', 'value', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'simply', 'based', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'fork', '15', 'purchase', ""'ve"", 'given', 'rent']",N/A

After a title introduction establishing his credentials, we see him as he goes on a job in Russia - but all does nto go as planned, and he has to question who is telling him the truth.  His only clue is a young Russian woman, who he takes with him as he tries to unravel his predicament.  Meanwhile, Dougray Scott is the Interpol officer out to track him down in a remarkably wooden performance.  Olyphant himself performs adequately, in a role which requires him to reign in any charisma which is his stock in trade, and become for the most part emotionless.There is undoubtedly a large suspension of belief required, as the worlds law agencies find it impossible to track a man who wanders around bald with a barcode on the back of his head.. but the action scenes are fun enough, and at least some plot has been inserted to help the unlikely transition from game to big screen.  Olga Kurylenko (soon to be seen in the new Bond movie Quantum of Solace) is very easy on the eye in a variety of incredibly unlikely clothes which seem to only barely cover her - and not always that.Best of all perhaps, are the locations - St Petersburg looks great, and Bulgaria filling in for Russia looks satisfyingly fresh and different to the norm.All in all, this does not do enough to break the curse of game to big screen adaptations being disappointments, but it's better than most and for brainless and occasionally imaginative action is worth a watch.",3,Surprising what Olyphant keeps in his trunk...,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,1742,"['Critics', 'were', 'pretty', 'sniffy', 'movie', 'release', 'true', 'piece', 'art', 'taken', 'own', 'hyper-kinetic', 'action', 'merits', 'actually', 'not', 'bad.Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Hitman', 'created', 'trained', 'indoctrinated', 'consummate', 'killer', 'known', 'only', 'number', '47', 'title', 'introduction', 'establishing', 'credentials', 'see', 'job', 'Russia', 'nto', 'go', 'planned', 'question', 'who', 'telling', 'truth', 'only', 'clue', 'young', 'Russian', 'woman', 'who', 'unravel', 'predicament', 'Meanwhile', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'Interpol', 'officer', 'track', 'down', 'remarkably', 'wooden', 'performance', 'adequately', 'role', 'reign', 'charisma', 'stock', 'trade', 'become', 'most', 'part', 'undoubtedly', 'large', 'suspension', 'belief', 'required', 'worlds', 'law', 'agencies', 'find', 'impossible', 'track', 'man', 'who', 'bald', 'barcode', 'back', 'head..', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'enough', 'least', 'plot', 'been', 'inserted', 'help', 'unlikely', 'transition', 'game', 'big', 'screen', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'soon', 'be', 'seen', 'new', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'very', 'easy', 'eye', 'variety', 'incredibly', 'unlikely', 'clothes', 'seem', 'only', 'barely', 'cover', 'not', 'always', 'that.Best', 'perhaps', 'are', 'locations', 'St', 'Petersburg', 'great', 'Bulgaria', 'filling', 'Russia', 'satisfyingly', 'fresh', 'different', 'norm.All', 'not', 'do', 'enough', 'break', 'curse', 'game', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'being', 'disappointments', 'better', 'most', 'brainless', 'occasionally', 'imaginative', 'action', 'watch']",N/A

If you want more storyline details please read the other reviews.I had never heard of this movie and randomly rented it off Blockbuster but it was so good I ended up buying it.  Blu-ray of course is awesome with 1080p resolution along with DTS sound.  Translation: sharp, crisp picture and excellent sound with effects.  The extras with In the Crosshairs, Digital Hits (transitioning from game to movie), Alternate Endings, and especially Instruments of Destruction (description and range firing of all the guns used in the movie - no guy should miss this) were excellent.  I usually don't even bother with the extras but since this action-packed movie was so good I also watched every single one of those featurettes.  So you just finished the movie and thought ""Wow that was really good"" then watch the extras and think ""wow, that's even more cool"".  Timothy Olyphant who plays the bad guy in Live Free or Die Hard and the good guy in Hitman is a perfect fit for the role of 47: cool, calm, and deadly.  Turns out none of the main actors are russian (except Olga Kurylenko - pretty cute) which makes you wonder whether the spoken russian in the movie is any good.  The french director Xavier Gens is an excellent director (well-known in Europe) and would have been a perfect match directing something like The Matrix trilogy.The digital copy was transferred to my PDA so I can watch it over and over at work LOL.

The underrated Timothy Olyphant (replacing Vin Diesel), of HBO's Deadwood and Live Free or Die Hard, stars as Agent 47; an elite, lifelong assassin, who soon finds himself protecting his target (new Bond girl Olga Kurylenko) as he winds up in a political conspiracy as he treks across Eastern Europe, and is being tracked down by a desperate agent (Dougray Scott).  Though it never really delves into Agent 47's origin (it is hinted at, but those unfamiliar with the video game series will have no clue) or really the style of the game series either, Hitman features a bevy of flashy action and gunplay that is all well done.  That aside, the rest of the film is pretty lame and forgettable.  There's no substance to any of the characters at all, and plenty of plot holes and leaps in logic to boot.  Not to mention that as much as I like Olyphant, I just can't get into him as Agent 47.  He's not really all that bad in the role and he's a fine actor, but he just isn't all that believable as 47.  Flaws aside though, Hitman provides enough action for action movie junkies, and fans of the games may dig it despite how much it departs from its source material, but the potential that Hitman squanders is just so disappointing that in the end, the film is better left on the shelf.",2,"Could have been much worse, but nothing special",1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,1471,"['Loaded', 'eye-popping', 'flashy', 'action', 'Hitman', 'definitely', 'not', 'worst', 'video', 'game', 'film', 'adaptation', ""'ll"", 'see', 'gloss', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'underrated', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'replacing', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'HBO', 'Deadwood', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Agent', '47', 'elite', 'lifelong', 'assassin', 'who', 'soon', 'protecting', 'target', 'new', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'up', 'political', 'conspiracy', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'being', 'tracked', 'down', 'desperate', 'agent', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'never', 'really', 'Agent', '47', 'origin', 'hinted', 'unfamiliar', 'video', 'game', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'clue', 'really', 'style', 'game', 'series', 'Hitman', 'bevy', 'flashy', 'action', 'gunplay', 'well', 'done', 'aside', 'rest', 'film', 'pretty', 'lame', 'forgettable', 'substance', 'characters', 'plenty', 'plot', 'holes', 'leaps', 'logic', 'boot', 'Not', 'mention', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'Olyphant', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Agent', '47', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'role', 'fine', 'actor', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'believable', '47', 'Flaws', 'aside', 'Hitman', 'enough', 'action', 'action', 'movie', 'junkies', 'fans', 'games', 'may', 'dig', 'how', 'much', 'source', 'material', 'potential', 'Hitman', 'squanders', 'just', 'so', 'disappointing', 'end', 'film', 'better', 'left', 'shelf']",N/A

I was also happy to hear that Vin Diesel would not be playing the title role, though he was an executive producer. All in all I enjoyed this film. I had to watch it a few times to understand the story and catch plot devices that slipped by the first viewing. The story makes sense, the characters are interesting and the acting is par. There is a good balance of intrigue and humor and all the ends are tied by the end credits.One issue I have with the film is that the script strayed from the title character's original storyline of the game. In the movie 47 is an orphan taken in by a secret society that trains the children to become international assassins. In the game, 47 is a clone genetically engineered during the cold war to assassinate political targets mercilessly and efficiently with out leaving a trace. 47 was the best performing of all the clones ever engineered. He was part of the 7 series, hence the abbreviated title of 47. His full title, tattooed on the back of his head, is ""640509-040147"". The 7 series were the only line of engineered clones to turn out successful with 47 showing the most potential. Considered the best and most tactful of assassins from the program 47 basically became self aware and eventually went rogue resulting in the end of the clone program. Soon-after all the clones were hunted down and/or destroyed. 47 was the only one never accounted for. I feel that the game 47 was a far more dynamic character with greater plot potential. However, for what it was, the film did a reasonable job of creating it's own origins for 47. I know that Hollywood does this often when adapting previously developed characters from one medium to the next. However, Myself included, I know about 300 million other people who wished this was the exception rather than the rule but, I digress.When I heard Timothy Olyphant was chosen to play the role of 47 I wasn't sure what to expect. I had seen him in other roles and thought he was ok but I wasn't confident he could play this role. Besides, I was a fan of the Game series and my expectations had to be met. Like almost everyone else I envisioned Jason Statham in this role, mainly because of ""The Transporter"" but now I'm not so sure he could have done it with as much suave and calculation as Olyphant did. With hind sight being 20/20 I'm happy with the producers choice. And, now with the announcement that a sequel is in the works I hope Olyphant reprises the role and is given more flexibility if not out right autonomy to play the role.As for the other characters and actors, Dougary Scott executed the role of an obsessed InterPol agent very well, he convinced me that he was desperate to catch and expose 47 while at the same time secretly harboring a respect for his expertise. Robert Knepper played a corrupt Russian KGB operative contributing to plot a conspiracy. He pulled off the Russian accent perfectly while not over exaggerating how corrupt his character was. Olga Kurylenko plays the unsuspecting damsel in distress that reveals 47's possible vulnerabilities while ignorantly holding a major key to the plot. These were the main actors in the movie and they all convincingly played their parts well.

1139353,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0012RLX7Y,RMurray847,"[4, 5]","HITMAN was better than I expected.  It's still not a good movie, but it wasn't quite the dreck-fest I feared.  While still a piece of nonsense, I actually grew to like Timothy Olyphant's performance enough to forgive many other failings of the film.I've never played the video game, and cannot comment on its success transferring to film.HITMAN shows us, in the opening credit sequence (with Ave Maria playing in the background for no good reason, except, I suppose, that it's always a little haunting) that there is a society that exists to take young children, remove them from society, and turn them into passionless, soulless killing machines.  An assassin factory.  To sort of quote the movie:  ""the society was rumored to be so secret that no one knew it existed.""  So who started the rumors anyway?These killers have their heads shaved and a huge bar code tattooed on the backs of their necks.  These bar codes are VERY noticeable, but I guess in the world of HITMAN, society has decided to ignore these folks.Olyphant plays a hitman who is sent to kill the Russian president (I think that's who he was...it's been a week since I saw it, so who remembers the plot!).  And then he's asked to kill a witness.  Yet it turns out that this is all a complicated double-cross that has him targeted for elimination.  He investigates those who have betrayed him, and in proper hitman fashion, sets out to get his vengeance.Meanwhile, he is stalked around the world by a man from Interpol (Dougray Scott), who seems to have a great nose for arriving where the hitman was 30 seconds ago, but never where he is NOW.Olyphant develops an interest in the witness he nearly killed, played by recent Bond girl Olga Kurylenko (who also appears in video game inspired MAX PAYNE).  And it is, oddly, this relationship that I actually enjoyed.  I say ""oddly"" because Kurylenko is NOT a good actress.  (Although if you find her attractive or sexy, you'll want to see the film for sure.  She spends lot of it nude.)  I simply enjoyed watching Olyphant warm up to her.  He is a man without much personality, and apparently pretty much sexless as well.  He kills and survives to kill again. He moves through the world without being noticed.  And that's what he was bred to do.  Yet this woman intrigues him, and he begins to imagine a life beyond what he has always known.  And he shows glimmerings of a rudimentary conscience.  By no means am I suggesting his performance (or the script) are award worthy or anything such thing.  But to me, who was expecting little beyond mindless action, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually almost cared what happened to this guy.As for the action...there is plenty. Much of it is perfunctory, and very little is original.  There's a good fight scene involving short swords, but other than that, it's nothing special.Olyphant is a decent actor (I liked him in GO, where he played a drug dealer...not so much in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD).  This role at least does him no damage, because he milks all he can from it.  Dougray Scott has a wonderful, rich accent.  Too bad he's a feeble actor, and in this part, the script calls for him to say silly things.  If HITMAN had given us a decent foil for Olyphant, it would have been even better.  Instead we get a cop that we never for one second think can get the better of our hit man.If you're looking for a mindless, violent shoot-`em-up...then this film will suit fairly well.  If by my review you're thinking, ""hey, I don't really like mindless shoot-`em-ups"" but this sounds like something more...well...I'm sorry I left that impression.  It is still mostly mindless...but just a tiny bit better than expected.",3,Slightly less awful than I expected.,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,3681,"['HITMAN', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'dreck-fest', 'feared', 'still', 'piece', 'nonsense', 'actually', 'grew', 'like', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'performance', 'enough', 'forgive', 'many', 'other', 'failings', 'film.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'video', 'game', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'success', 'transferring', 'film.HITMAN', 'shows', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'Ave', 'Maria', 'playing', 'background', 'good', 'reason', 'suppose', 'always', 'little', 'haunting', 'society', 'take', 'young', 'children', 'remove', 'society', 'turn', 'passionless', 'soulless', 'killing', 'machines', 'assassin', 'factory', 'sort', 'quote', 'movie', 'society', 'was', 'rumored', 'be', 'so', 'secret', 'one', 'knew', 'existed', 'who', 'started', 'rumors', 'anyway', 'killers', 'have', 'heads', 'shaved', 'huge', 'bar', 'code', 'tattooed', 'backs', 'necks', 'bar', 'codes', 'are', 'VERY', 'noticeable', 'guess', 'world', 'HITMAN', 'society', 'decided', 'ignore', 'folks.Olyphant', 'hitman', 'who', 'sent', 'kill', 'Russian', 'president', 'think', 'who', 'was', 'been', 'week', 'saw', 'so', 'who', 'plot', 'then', 'asked', 'kill', 'witness', 'out', 'complicated', 'double-cross', 'targeted', 'elimination', 'who', 'have', 'betrayed', 'proper', 'hitman', 'fashion', 'out', 'get', 'vengeance.Meanwhile', 'stalked', 'world', 'man', 'Interpol', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'who', 'have', 'great', 'nose', 'arriving', 'where', 'hitman', 'was', '30', 'seconds', 'ago', 'never', 'where', 'NOW.Olyphant', 'interest', 'witness', 'nearly', 'killed', 'played', 'recent', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'who', 'also', 'video', 'game', 'inspired', 'MAX', 'PAYNE', 'oddly', 'relationship', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'say', 'oddly', 'Kurylenko', 'NOT', 'good', 'actress', 'find', 'attractive', 'sexy', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'film', 'sure', 'lot', 'nude', 'simply', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Olyphant', 'warm', 'up', 'man', 'much', 'personality', 'apparently', 'pretty', 'much', 'sexless', 'as', 'well', 'kill', 'again', 'world', 'being', 'noticed', 'what', 'was', 'bred', 'do', 'Yet', 'woman', 'imagine', 'life', 'what', 'always', 'known', 'glimmerings', 'rudimentary', 'conscience', 'means', 'am', 'suggesting', 'performance', 'script', 'are', 'award', 'worthy', 'anything', 'such', 'thing', 'who', 'was', 'expecting', 'little', 'mindless', 'action', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'actually', 'almost', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'guy.As', 'action', 'plenty', 'Much', 'perfunctory', 'very', 'little', 'original', 'good', 'fight', 'scene', 'involving', 'short', 'swords', 'other', 'nothing', 'special.Olyphant', 'decent', 'actor', 'liked', 'GO', 'where', 'played', 'drug', 'dealer', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'LIVE', 'FREE', 'OR', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'role', 'least', 'damage', 'all', 'can', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'wonderful', 'rich', 'accent', 'Too', 'bad', 'feeble', 'actor', 'part', 'script', 'say', 'silly', 'things', 'HITMAN', 'had', 'given', 'decent', 'foil', 'Olyphant', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'Instead', 'get', 'cop', 'never', 'one', 'second', 'think', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'hit', 'man.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'mindless', 'violent', 'shoot-', 'em-up', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'suit', 'fairly', 'well', 'review', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'hey', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'mindless', 'shoot-', 'em-ups', 'something', 'more', 'well', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'left', 'impression', 'still', 'mostly', 'mindless', 'just', 'tiny', 'bit', 'better', 'expected']",N/A

For those who are unfamiliar with the character, Hitman is based on the popular videogame of the same name. Now the game is very, very good. I used to play the game back in the day, but this movie fails indefinitely to adapt the character to the movie.The good qualities of the film are that it has the feel and look of a spy/action movie, the actor Timothy Oliphant looks like Agent 47, the bloodshed is well done and the lead actress is in my opinion a good choice. so what's wrong?...well for starters the movie lacks a real cohesion, it feels at times to muddled and confusing; sure it's interesting to have the audience in suspense and a little confused but without pushing the envelope. Also the film retracts from the traditional video game action which is more stealth like and mysterious; here it relies more on fast paced and ludicrous  action. Leaving the audience a little cheated. Oliphant may look like Agent 47 but he doesn't play him all the way. In some scenes he has that gritty and similar walk and persona. But he doesn't have that espionage look, nor does he handle weapons like the game. and the films story overall is mediocre and lacks motivation; at times it felt as if it was going nowhere just back and forth with no real sense of direction.the films plot synopsis is as follows. Agent 47 (Hitman) works for an elite international agency that trains there men to become professional kill for hire assassins. Agent 47 is sent to Russia to murder a presidential candidate; on the move someone kills this candidate before he does. he know believes he is being double crossed, interesting premise but afterwards it clutters itself down with over stylish scenes that look nice but are overall formulaic. And not to mention many absurdities, like a fight scene with swords in a subway- it sounds nice but when u sit and watch its another story. Another thing if there agency is so secretive why place their commercial logo on their weapons and poisons, and why put barcodes on the agents...not very secretive right. I mean in the game its okay but in a movie it feels kinda out of place. Overall the movie could have been much better but its story kills the overall good look of the film.MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5",2,Not Exactly What I Was Expecting,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2311,"['Hitman', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'disappointments', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'character', 'Hitman', 'based', 'popular', 'videogame', 'same', 'name', 'Now', 'game', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'used', 'play', 'game', 'back', 'day', 'movie', 'indefinitely', 'adapt', 'character', 'movie.The', 'good', 'qualities', 'film', 'are', 'feel', 'look', 'spy/action', 'movie', 'actor', 'Timothy', 'Oliphant', 'Agent', '47', 'bloodshed', 'well', 'done', 'lead', 'actress', 'opinion', 'good', 'choice', 'what', 'wrong', 'well', 'starters', 'movie', 'real', 'cohesion', 'times', 'muddled', 'confusing', 'sure', 'interesting', 'have', 'audience', 'suspense', 'little', 'confused', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'Also', 'film', 'retracts', 'traditional', 'video', 'game', 'action', 'more', 'stealth', 'mysterious', 'here', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'ludicrous', 'action', 'Leaving', 'audience', 'little', 'cheated', 'Oliphant', 'may', 'look', 'Agent', '47', ""n't"", 'play', 'way', 'scenes', 'gritty', 'similar', 'walk', 'persona', ""n't"", 'have', 'espionage', 'look', 'handle', 'weapons', 'game', 'films', 'story', 'overall', 'mediocre', 'motivation', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'going', 'nowhere', 'just', 'back', 'forth', 'real', 'sense', 'direction.the', 'films', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'Agent', '47', 'Hitman', 'elite', 'international', 'agency', 'men', 'become', 'professional', 'kill', 'hire', 'assassins', 'Agent', '47', 'sent', 'Russia', 'murder', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'move', 'someone', 'candidate', 'know', 'being', 'double', 'crossed', 'interesting', 'premise', 'afterwards', 'down', 'stylish', 'scenes', 'look', 'nice', 'are', 'overall', 'formulaic', 'not', 'mention', 'many', 'absurdities', 'fight', 'scene', 'swords', 'subway-', 'nice', 'when', 'u', 'sit', 'watch', 'story', 'thing', 'agency', 'so', 'secretive', 'why', 'place', 'commercial', 'logo', 'weapons', 'poisons', 'why', 'put', 'barcodes', 'agents', 'not', 'very', 'secretive', 'right', 'mean', 'game', 'okay', 'movie', 'kinda', 'place', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'overall', 'good', 'look', 'film.MY', 'PERSONAL', 'RATING', '2', 'OUT', '5']",N/A

I disagreed with the answer that the movie provides at the end. Nevertheless the movie does not presume to tell the viewer that this is the ""right"" answer.The protagonist does not provide us with his answer to the question, though he kills many men. So I think the viewer should also try to answer another question. Is the protagonist a good man? I think he is.Despite its being based on a game, Hitman is a good, quality action movie, just about as good as action movies get. If it's a B movie, at least it's a B+ movie. Its acting is weak, though tolerable. The story doesn't have the depth of any of the Bourne trilogy, but it is solid. So are the sound and cinematography, and the editing. The action sequences are better than much I have seen in cheap B movies. Most of the action is considerate of the viewer and convincing enough not to be annoying. You may, however, need to employ some compassionate, imaginative rationalization.

However if the director was trying to potray the hitman as a ""Macho"", romantic guy then the movie fails miserably. In fact that is how the director has tried to potray him. However there is nothing macho about some lockjaw guy who speaks with small movement of the lips. And because his jaw is locked it is difficult to hear and watch him speak so stressfully. To deliver powerful dialogues the Hitman has to not only strain himself to speak but there is hardly any voice coming out. The voice isn't authorotative even when it is obvious that the voice was dubbed in the studio.Remember those great lines that James Bond or any of those classic heroes deliver. In fact movies are remembered for them. On the other hand The Hitman delivers some terrific flop lines. The most obvious one being the lines that he speaks just after Olga describes her torture session with the Russian mafia when she had tried to escape it once. ""If you ever again interfere with me like that..."" What a fiasco! What a let down for the audience in the cinema that was waiting to laugh or feel good. Nothing macho or funny about it. I wonder what the editor or director was doing while editing this scene. You can imagine what it takes to speak them over and over again for many retakes.So in the end The Hitman just turns out to be a killing machine. Timothy Olyphant plays the lockjaw Hitman. No wonder they deliberately avoided kissing, smooching or even eating scenes becuase then this guy will have to use his mouth and teeth differently. This means even a sequel will have the same thing. If the excuse for his robotic behavior is the way he was taught in genetic-school how come the other hitmen from the same school don't act that way.Too much of simply point at someone's head at close quarters and never miss a shot also gets boring after a point. The Hitman literally being unscathed in all the fights further adds to the unrealism.In Die Hard 4 I complained about Olyphant not showing clenched teeth, but that's what he does all the time on this one.

1139378,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0012RLX7Y,Tim Janson,"[4, 4]","Films based upon video games haven't exactly enjoyed the greatest success.  From the terrifically bad Uwe Boll films, to Doom and Street Fighter, video game adaptations have been some of the worst films in recent years.  This brings us to the latest attempt, Hitman, which I can confidently state...isn't all that bad.  It's not groundbreaking and its got its share of plot holes but it's a decent action film with a sort of James Bond Lite feel.Timothy Olyphant turns in a surprisingly deep performance in his role as the assassin known only as Number 47.  He works for the ""Organization"" who takes orphans and trains them to be nameless and anonymous assassins, giving them only a number and tattooing barcodes on the backs of their heads.  47 is the best at what he does.  A ghost who slips in, kills whom ever he's been assigned to kill, and then disappears.  Interpol agent Mike Whittier (Scott) has been tracking down 47 for several years.  The trail leads to Russia as Number 47 accepts a mission to kill the Russian President Mikhail Belicoff.  The hit seems to go off as planned until 47 sees the Russian President alive and well on the news.  He knows there's no way he could have missed.47 soon realizes that he's been set-up by his own organization in a covert plot to replace the Russian president with a look-alike.  The only loose ends are Number 47 and a Russian prostitute, Nika, who was a virtual slave to Belicoff's sadistic brother Udre.  The Organization sends out a team of it's own assassins to kill 47 and the girl.  Meanwhile Whittier's investigation is hindered by Russian secret police just as he finally seems to have 47 trapped.Hitman has some outstanding action scenes that are stylishly filmed.  47's escape from his hotel when he discovers the double cross is just one of the many action highlights.  The whole film had a very elegant look to it.  There are some wonderful framing shots and use of slow motion which I normally detest.  You can certainly tell that James Bond films are a big influence on Director Xavier Gens.  47 doesn't have an array of gadgets but he does have a fantastic arsenal of the latest weapons at his disposal.Olyphant plays Number 47 as somewhat emotionally challenged.  He's used to being in control and when he's betrayed it almost confuses him.  Later, when Nika tries to seduce him, he knocks her out with a hypodermic needle.  One might think it is because he simply has no time for sex but my take was that the mere thought of sex was too vexing for 47.  He didn't know how to react to Nika's advances and this merely underscored the fact that being an assassin is all he's known throughout his life.Furthering the Bond influence, Olga Kurylenko who plays Nika, is all set to become the next Bond Girl when she teams with Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace.  She was one of my favorite things in the movie.  She's beautiful and exotic, tough and sexy.  All of the performances in Hitman were far better than I expected.

1139392,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0012RLX7Y,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[10, 15]","When one goes to see a video-game inspired movie; one cannot expect too much. This latest outing ""Hitman"" directed by Xavier Gens may leave a lot to be desired when it comes to an original plot but does offer decent action entertainment. I am at a slight disadvantage, as I have never played the video game before; all I can do is comment on how well ""Hitman"" is made and its entertainment value. I managed to get a free ticket out of the ""Live Free and Die Hard"" DVD so at least my review will not be influenced by the ""paid to see it"" mentality.Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) is an impeccably dressed assassin with a mysterious past. He was bred by a secret organization to kill anyone so long as the price is right. He has such a reputation that Interpol is hot on his heels and nicknamed him ""A Ghost"". His next target is the Russian leader Belkoff. 47 never misses, he always finishes his mission. To his surprise, the next day, Belkoff shows up on television; alive and breathing. Agent 47 has been set up as a ""fall guy"" for political reasons. Now, Agent 47 is on a mission to find out who set him up. He hooks up with a sexy prostitute (Olga Kurylenko) he embarks on a bloody trail to find answers, with an obsessed Interpol agent (Dougray Scott), the Russian intelligence, and the organization itself that bred him hot in his trail...Being a movie adapted from a video game, expect the usual clich&eacute;s; a cool intimidating glorified anti-hero, a sexy woman with a sordid past, very cool visuals and lots of intense action. The plot is definitely unoriginal and director Xavier Gens pulled out all the stops to provide the audience with a visual and aural feast for action junkies. A lot of explosions, nudity and gunfire are what you will get from ""Hitman"". Hong Kong action films mixed in with the Luc Besson attitude roughly inspire the action. This is definitely a flick for testosterone-laden males, as the experience is obviously not geared toward the female audience. The hyper-kinetic visuals have the usual slow-motion action with creative camera positioning, stylish but subtle gunfights that looks very fresh and sexy at the same time. Director Gens definitely let the proceedings go wild with the usual political twist to avoid the plot holes from reaching the reasoning processes of the brain. The film is definitely another film with ""more style than substance"" and offers nothing new in the action genre.Timothy Olyphant is a decent presence on-screen. However, his performance in the mano-o-mano fights needs a lot to be desired. Olyphant looks really awkward performing the martial arts moves and his moves look very stiff and unconvincing. The role actually feels tailor-made for ""Transporter"" action star; Jason Statham who can perform both the martial arts moves and the alluringly intense attitude. Olyphant doesn't have the presence of a suave and deadly assassin. Olga Kurylenko serves more as eye-candy and to provide the usual sly humor. She struts around the screen mostly in ultra skimpy outfits (no underwear) or naked most of the time. (I'm not complaining)""Hitman"" is a mixed bag. While it definitely leans toward the usual clich&eacute;s and doesn't offer anything groundbreaking, I found it a good enough diversion once I consider the source material. While totally inferior to similar films, I did consider the source material. After all, this film is based on a video game, so expect realism to be thrown out the window. How can top secretive assassins walk around in really nice suits and shaved heads with a bar-code walk around unnoticed?Well, in the world of video games; this reality does exist.Timidly Recommended for fans of the game.
