One day, while at David's company party, a sexy young student named Nicole boldly tells Jill that she's going to steal her husband--a courageous yet ironic assertion, considering that 4 years ago, Jill stole David away from his ex-wife.Now that Jill is Mrs. David Plumley, could young Nicole be the other woman that Jill had been? Then, when David's boss is killed in his sleep and his wife confesses to the murder but claims self-defense, an overwhelmed Jill turns to old friend and fellow journalist Pete Henderson (Jason Priestley) to find out the truth. Based on the best-selling novel by Joy Fielding.It was also interesting seeing Jason Priestley who is best known as the foxy Brandon Walsh on BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and Josie Bissett whom is best known for her role as sexy designer Jane Mancini on MELROSE PLACE, co-star in this drama together, especially since MELROSE PLACE was a spinoff of BEVERLY HILLS, 90210.",4,Unfaithful Love,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1099,"['successful', 'news', 'producer', 'bright', 'future', 'Jill', 'Plumley', 'Josie', 'Bisset', 'forsake', 'career', 'favor', 'new', 'role', 'devoted', 'wife', 'lawyer', 'husband', 'David', 'One', 'day', 'David', 'company', 'party', 'sexy', 'young', 'student', 'named', 'Nicole', 'boldly', 'Jill', 'going', 'steal', 'husband', 'courageous', 'yet', 'ironic', 'assertion', 'considering', '4', 'years', 'ago', 'Jill', 'David', 'away', 'ex-wife.Now', 'Jill', 'Mrs.', 'David', 'Plumley', 'could', 'young', 'Nicole', 'be', 'other', 'woman', 'Jill', 'had', 'been', 'Then', 'when', 'David', 'boss', 'killed', 'sleep', 'wife', 'murder', 'claims', 'self-defense', 'overwhelmed', 'Jill', 'old', 'friend', 'fellow', 'journalist', 'Pete', 'Henderson', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'Based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Joy', 'Fielding.It', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'foxy', 'Brandon', 'Walsh', 'BEVERLY', 'HILLS', '90210', 'Josie', 'Bissett', 'whom', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'sexy', 'designer', 'Jane', 'Mancini', 'MELROSE', 'PLACE', 'co-star', 'drama', 'together', 'especially', 'MELROSE', 'PLACE', 'was', 'spinoff', 'BEVERLY', 'HILLS', '90210']",Joy Fielding's The Other Woman
