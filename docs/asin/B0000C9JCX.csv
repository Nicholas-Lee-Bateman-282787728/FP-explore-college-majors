These movies brought the bible to life for my 5 year old son and let him SEE the love that God has for us.  My son was so excited about learning the bible and tells the stories of Moses and Joseph to everyone. These two movies allowed me to further his teaching outside of movie time with added fun (example: he can now recite all 66 books of the bible, the 10 commandments, the 12 tribes of Isreal, and the 12 Apostles all in a fun way)  He's so pushy in making me tell him more and more stories out of the bible after seeing these two movies.  I even had to make him a ""Joseph Coat"", and a "" Moses Coat"" that he wears with pride.  I would recommend these movies without a second thought.  They are excellent!!!!  I hope more high quality movies are made in the future!!!!!",5,Thank you to all who worked on these movies!!,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,884,"['could', 'thank', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'making', '2', 'movies', 'would', 'was', 'movie', 'magic', 'best', 'movies', 'brought', 'bible', 'life', '5', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'let', 'SEE', 'love', 'God', 'son', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'learning', 'bible', 'stories', 'Moses', 'Joseph', 'everyone', 'two', 'movies', 'allowed', 'further', 'teaching', 'movie', 'time', 'added', 'fun', 'example', 'can', 'now', 'recite', '66', 'books', 'bible', '10', 'commandments', '12', 'tribes', 'Isreal', '12', 'Apostles', 'fun', 'way', 'so', 'pushy', 'making', 'tell', 'more', 'more', 'stories', 'bible', 'seeing', 'two', 'movies', 'even', 'had', 'make', 'Joseph', 'Coat', 'Moses', 'Coat', 'pride', 'would', 'recommend', 'movies', 'second', 'thought', 'are', 'excellent', 'hope', 'more', 'high', 'quality', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'future']",N/A

This is a GREAT deal for both movies. You won't be disappointed!I was not expecting Joseph King of Dreams to be as good as Prince of Egypt, but like the first review that I read, I think it is as good if not better than Prince of Egypt. The picture is vibrant and wonderful, the story is as close to the true story as possible, and the songs are absolutely WONDERFUL. My children loves this movie. It is a great story about forgiveness, love, and faith. I was suprised to find that Ben Affleck was the voice for Joseph. Although he is not my favorite actor he does a WONDERFUL job as the voice of Joseph. Much better than Matt Damon as the voice in Dreamworks movie &quot;Spirit&quot;. Buy this movie, you will not be disappointed and your family will love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish they had done more advertising for this movie and it had received more attention. It deserves it. I hope that Dreamworks does more films like this of the stories in the Bible!",5,A MUST BUY!!!!!
