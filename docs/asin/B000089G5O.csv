The plot is simply too hard to figure out, and it will only piss you off when you're able to figure out some parts of it. Everything good about the original has gone horribly wrong in its hellish sequel. The original actors are basically no where to be found in the sequel, which also ruins the experience. The artwork doesn't seem very good either, and will only make you wonder how a Disney movie can manage that.

But that was no excuse - Disney had to use the material they made for their stillbirth somehow...Neither Milo nor Cookie have the same voices.  It's doubtful whether even Disney could have come up with enough money to pay Fox to reprise his role in this sequel.  The man that voiced Cookie passed away - hopefully before he could see this B-Grade monster fest.In the first of the three stories, Milo and his ""Team Atlantis"" (most of the characters from the original Atlantis movie) have to stop a Kraken from destroying a small village.Then, believe it or not, they all leave Atlantis to go to the American Southwest to tame a pack of Coyotes.  Coyotes?  I thought they could have come up with something more challenging than that...Then to top it all off, it's off to Antarctica to battle an ice monster.  I almost wish they had run into something a little more life-threatening, like Lovecraft's ""Old Ones"".This reminded me a =lot= of the old ""Scooby-Doo"" mysteries, except with real monsters.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[18, 20]","Considering that this ""movie"" is actually a combination of three stories originally produced for an ""Atlantis"" cartoon that never came to fruition, I find it to be unfair to judge these adventures as one whole.  Instead, I'll give a brief review of each of the three adventures and then summarize the entire movie.First off, we have Milo, Kida and the gang tackling the mighty Kraken.  No, it isn't the Kraken you may remember from ""Clash Of The Titans,"" but a sea-dwelling demon who wreaks havoc in the seas and possesses a small village.  The story is probably the best of the three.  It is quickly paced and has pretty good development.The second story is rather boring.  It takes place in the American Southwest.  A band of ""dust coyote spirits"" have attacked one of the locals who happens to have found some ancient pottery.  Milo's team has to figure out why the ""coyotes"" are attacking the locals and put a stop to them.  The ending of the tale is rather brilliant, but not enough to save this chapter of the entire film.The final story nods its hat toward Norse mythology.  It features a man wanting to destroy the current world and rule over a newer, better one.  Of course, he can't do this as a mere mortal, so he uses a spear that is magically inclined and becomes ""Odin.""  If you know anything about Norse mythology, you know that Odin is similar to Zeus, only he rules the cold north.  Once again, Milo and his crew have to save the day.So what ties all of these little adventures together?  Atlantis, of course.  Using a mythology that ties just about every culture together, we find through these three tales that Atlantis is the center of the cultural universe.  In other words, all gods come from Atlantis, and their powers are all knowing and all caring when placed into the hands of the right individuals.  It looks like Kida and Milo and his team are the folks intended to control all of this power.These tales aren't as horrible as others have stated.  They just have to be looked at as individual stories and I'm sure you'll get more enjoyment out of them.  If you have young sons in your family, they'll probably get the most enjoyment out of this movie.  Much like its predecessor, it relies on mythology and technology to move the story along.  Those are two things that keep small children(8 and under)from getting to interested in this movie.In all honesty, I'd rent this before buying it.  If your kids enjoy it, then you may consider investing in it.",3,Three Tales Tied Loosely Together,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,2480,"['Considering', 'movie', 'actually', 'combination', 'three', 'stories', 'originally', 'produced', 'Atlantis', 'cartoon', 'never', 'came', 'fruition', 'find', 'be', 'unfair', 'judge', 'adventures', 'one', 'whole', 'Instead', ""'ll"", 'give', 'brief', 'review', 'three', 'adventures', 'then', 'summarize', 'entire', 'movie.First', 'have', 'Milo', 'Kida', 'gang', 'tackling', 'mighty', 'Kraken', 'No', ""n't"", 'Kraken', 'may', 'remember', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'sea-dwelling', 'demon', 'who', 'havoc', 'seas', 'small', 'village', 'story', 'probably', 'best', 'three', 'quickly', 'paced', 'pretty', 'good', 'development.The', 'second', 'story', 'rather', 'boring', 'place', 'American', 'Southwest', 'band', 'dust', 'coyote', 'spirits', 'have', 'attacked', 'one', 'locals', 'who', 'happens', 'have', 'found', 'ancient', 'pottery', 'Milo', 'team', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'coyotes', 'are', 'attacking', 'locals', 'put', 'stop', 'ending', 'tale', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'chapter', 'entire', 'film.The', 'final', 'story', 'nods', 'hat', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'man', 'wanting', 'destroy', 'current', 'world', 'rule', 'newer', 'better', 'one', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'mere', 'mortal', 'spear', 'magically', 'inclined', 'Odin', 'know', 'anything', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'know', 'Odin', 'similar', 'Zeus', 'only', 'rules', 'cold', 'north', 'Once', 'again', 'Milo', 'crew', 'have', 'save', 'day.So', 'what', 'little', 'adventures', 'together', 'Atlantis', 'course', 'Using', 'mythology', 'just', 'about', 'culture', 'together', 'find', 'three', 'tales', 'Atlantis', 'center', 'cultural', 'universe', 'other', 'words', 'gods', 'come', 'Atlantis', 'powers', 'are', 'knowing', 'caring', 'when', 'placed', 'hands', 'right', 'individuals', 'Kida', 'Milo', 'team', 'are', 'folks', 'intended', 'control', 'power.These', 'tales', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'horrible', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'just', 'have', 'be', 'looked', 'individual', 'stories', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'have', 'young', 'sons', 'family', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'most', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'Much', 'predecessor', 'mythology', 'technology', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'keep', 'small', 'children', '8', 'getting', 'interested', 'movie.In', 'honesty', ""'d"", 'rent', 'buying', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'then', 'may', 'consider', 'investing']",N/A

It was very episodic, but that was because it was made out of the only three episodes that were made for a proposed Atlantis TV series.  Perhaps the most disapointing thing about this movie was that the wonderfully talented Michael J. Fox did not return as the voice of Milo.

Sure, they are all related to artifacts that were created by the king of Atlantis, but that's about it.Poorly conceived, blandly presented, and with an ALL NEW VOICE for Milo (they obviously couldn't get Michael J.
