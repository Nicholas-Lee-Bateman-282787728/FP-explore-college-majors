983354,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000F5WR4W,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 3]","Not for the faint of heart, 'Running Scared' does to gangster shoot-out movies what 'Kill Bill, Vol. 1' did for martial arts.  It is a relentlessly bloody, shoot-out rollercoaster romp from the mad genius of writer-director, Wayne Kramer.  The action scenes go full-throttle, and the perfected violence is all presented like a paint-ball fight if Pollock were alive to create it.  It doesn't spare us any bad language by content or by volume, either.  Both the profanity and the racial and ethnic slurs, make 'Boy Scout' seem like it lives up to its title.  'All in the Family,' too, suddenly seems trite even by today's standards.  (I guess even real life can be offensive, too.)The fun, if you can call it that, starts with a high speed escape between mafia member, Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker), and his nine-year-old neighbor, Oleg, fleeing a shoot-out scene on their way to help.  Then, the movie backs up to the beginning, for its only major time warp where Joey and his mob members are hanging out in their local meth lab.  A rival gang bursts in, and we get an urban turf battle that's too brutal to mention and meant to be seen to be believed.  Later, the survivors are fed the bad news:  The rival gang consisted of undercover cops, meant to bring them down.  Now Joey is in charge of keeping the gun that killed a police officer.  He must also retrieve the bullet from the hospital where it was extracted from the victim.  Complications are hallmark in this film, and Joey's son's best friend, Oleg Tupersky (Cameron Bright), finds the gun when the two boys are playing in Joey's house.  Oleg's family are next-door neighbor Russian immigrants, and his father, Mike, is a member of the rival Russian mafia and keeps a meth lab on the premises.  Oleg uses the gun as vengeance against his father's drug induced domestic violence.  The rest of the movie is a constant chase to retrieve the gun as Oleg flees the crime scene, and Joey who must answer to his kin in crime to take all traces of guilt away.Romp, yes.  Gratuitous, sometimes.  Riveting, you betcha.  In the extras, Kramer, himself, states he wished to draw from the vintage movies of the seventies and eighties to make ""an intense and gritty"" film.  He could have fooled us.  The film seems to borrow more from 'The Matrix' and 'Pulp Fiction' than any movie I can remember from the seventies.  The pace seems modern enough.  All of the violent scenes (most of the movie) have frenetic, back-up memory flashbacks that aren't unlike 'Memento,' but edited like faster movies.  Much of the venue is artful, but gratuitous can describe portions that do serve an entertainment purpose.  'Running Scared' is over the top, but also scrapes the bottom of the barrel.  The scene where Oleg is taken by child abductors couldn't fail to shock all but the most calloused viewer.  The smiling abusers show people at their ickiest.  Speaking of gratuitous, 'Running Scared' seems like a strange place to be sporting causes.  They don't preach much, but there is a sincere attempt to rail against domestic violence and child abduction and exploitation.  Joey's wife, Teresa (Vera Farmiga), provides an anchor of decency with her hard-boiled maternal presence.  Her speech ""I have never seen evil before tonight...I did not marry an evil man,"" could have been the funniest or stupidest lines delivered in the whole movie, but Farmiga's fine performance prevents it from becoming anything less than authentic.  Paul Walker seems underrated given the energy and timing he provides for his maverick role as Joey.The extras are worthwhile.  Oddly, the concise twenty-minute commentary is solid on vision, details, and testimony.  Mostly, these portions of DVD's partly ruin the magic.  'Running Scared' is unique in the sense that this prospect is hardly possible for them.  This viewer believes this film should be rated NC-17, and bare breasts are the least convincing reason!  If you don't take it too seriously, 'Running Scared' is one compelling ride of a movie!",3,Yikes!

Especially after having seen this movie I'm sick of how often they can misrepresent a product, CD, or (especially!) a film their trying to present. I understand it's a matter of telling people the information that would drive them into spending their money on a 2 hour or so experience, but in this particular case, they dropped the ball big time!This trailers for this film made it appear as a garden variety action pic. Overtly violent and again without point. Imagine my shcck and awe (I'm using that term a lot more lately.) when I finally saw the film! It twists and turns with a gritty style of filmaking that actually calls back the films from the seventies, the dark crime films like French Connection, as upposed to other films who merely say that but don't deliever.Paul Walker is just what he needs to be. Gritty, real, and whatever adjectives you wish to put to describe his manic performance. Playing a low level mobster with a loving family, he makes mistakes but goes out of his way to fix them. Cameron Bright, the young actor who plays Oleg is simply stunning. Vera Farmiga? Wayne Cramer is right. Her eyes are hypnotic. She is, as she does in her brilliant turn in The Departed, the moral center of the film.Fantastic action, great dialouge, amazing camera work, fantastic story! How could they have messed it up?

983356,A1KSO56UWS2R7I,B000F5WR4W,"Adam L. Safianow ""Kiddo""","[2, 3]","This is can be summed up by one word: INTENSE!The movie starts out very quick, leaving no time for explinations and never slows down.  You can't look away for 5 minutes in this movie without missing a lot.  There is a lot going, so you have to pay attention, which makes it very thrilling to watch.SYNOPSIS: Tommy Perello and his crew are making a deal with some black guys, when it gets violently interrupted by guys with shotguns wearing ski masks.  A violent fire fight goes down and only one other person, Tommy, and Joey (Walker) escape.  They find out the guys in ski masks were dirty cops, and Tommy gives the gun to Joey.  When Joey hides the gun in his basement, his son's friend finds it, steals it, shoots his father who abused him, and ran.  Now everyone is trying to get the ""hot"" gun that killed the dirty cops.  If Joey doesn't find the gun, he dies.The plot jerks you around, and goes for shock value.  There are a lot of really intense moments in the film, and that taste doesn't fade from your mouth.  A lot of really sick issues are also brought about, but I don't believe in spoilers, so I will leave it at that.  Overall, the acting was pretty decent, nobody tried to be a huge star and go over the top, which is good for a change.  I was pleasantly surprised with Walker's performance; he stayed very in character, and was believable as an ordinary guy that got mixed in with the wrong crowd.  Vera Farmiga (you may recognize from the remake of the Manchurian Candidate) also had a really good performace.  Cameron Bright also did a really good job, despite his lack of dialogue; at first I found him overrated, but as his roles become more mature, I am seeing him also mature as an actor.  I am not familiar with Alex Neuberger, but he was mediocre in this movie.The cinemintography is really good in this movie, but a little over used.  If you saw the trailer, the ice skating rink scene was really good, and you find out as the climax.  Scenes like that, as well as a lot of filter elements make for obviousness of action, but there was a little too much filtering.  Some of the movie almost seemed like an experiment for Kramer.  At least this movie was better than The Cooler, which surprisingly did better in the box office, then again, it had Alec Baldwin.All in all, this was a good movie.  The DVD was a fantastic transfers, and the commentary on the extras are insightful and interesting.  At least give this movie a rent, you won't be wasting your time.",4,A dark gangster movie that gets under your skin and never comes out,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,2486,"['can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'word', 'INTENSE', 'movie', 'out', 'very', 'quick', 'leaving', 'time', 'explinations', 'never', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'missing', 'lot', 'lot', 'going', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'very', 'thrilling', 'watch.SYNOPSIS', 'Tommy', 'Perello', 'crew', 'are', 'making', 'deal', 'black', 'guys', 'when', 'violently', 'interrupted', 'guys', 'shotguns', 'wearing', 'ski', 'masks', 'violent', 'fire', 'fight', 'down', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'Tommy', 'Joey', 'Walker', 'escape', 'find', 'out', 'guys', 'ski', 'masks', 'were', 'dirty', 'cops', 'Tommy', 'gun', 'Joey', 'When', 'Joey', 'gun', 'basement', 'son', 'friend', 'father', 'who', 'abused', 'ran', 'Now', 'everyone', 'trying', 'get', 'hot', 'gun', 'killed', 'dirty', 'cops', 'Joey', ""n't"", 'find', 'gun', 'plot', 'jerks', 'around', 'shock', 'value', 'are', 'lot', 'really', 'intense', 'moments', 'film', 'taste', ""n't"", 'fade', 'mouth', 'lot', 'really', 'sick', 'issues', 'are', 'also', 'brought', 'about', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'spoilers', 'will', 'leave', 'Overall', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'nobody', 'tried', 'be', 'huge', 'star', 'go', 'top', 'good', 'change', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Walker', 'performance', 'stayed', 'very', 'character', 'was', 'believable', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'got', 'mixed', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'may', 'recognize', 'remake', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'also', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'performace', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'also', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'first', 'found', 'overrated', 'become', 'more', 'mature', 'am', 'seeing', 'also', 'mature', 'actor', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'Alex', 'Neuberger', 'was', 'mediocre', 'movie.The', 'cinemintography', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'little', 'used', 'saw', 'trailer', 'ice', 'skating', 'rink', 'scene', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'find', 'out', 'climax', 'Scenes', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'filter', 'elements', 'make', 'obviousness', 'action', 'there', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'filtering', 'movie', 'almost', 'seemed', 'experiment', 'Kramer', 'least', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'Cooler', 'surprisingly', 'did', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'then', 'again', 'had', 'Alec', 'Baldwin.All', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'DVD', 'was', 'fantastic', 'transfers', 'commentary', 'extras', 'are', 'insightful', 'interesting', 'least', 'give', 'movie', 'rent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'wasting', 'time']",N/A

It's A L-O-T.The actors and few actresses (the main ones anyway) played their parts convincingly and the main hero who is super-handsome weaves himself in and out of trouble. Few people in this movie have a dirtier mouth either.The story revolves around him and his child's (Nick) best friend (Olig) (Who name's their poor kid that?) Nick and Olig are playing around and they find a gun. Nick is hesitant and very afraid and does nothing. Olig grabs the gun.The story goes from here (Olig's Russian ""father?"" threatens to kill him), Olig shoots his ""father"" because he's ruthless and hits his mother twice(+), Olig leaves the scene (he's still an adolescent BTW), mother thinks about visiting her lover in the hospital, Paul Walker and his wife find out and Paul takes off (Nick accompanies), they happen to go to the diner for a burger and Nick sees Olig, Olig shows him the gun and puts it into the stall toilet and later some guy by the name of Manny Perez steals it! How he finds it I can't fathom!?Anyway, lots of things occur before and after but this movie is a keeper.

983369,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,B000F5WR4W,Armando M. Mesa,"[3, 4]","A friend let me borrow this dvd.At first, I was hesistant to watch it based on assumptions I had made.No, the violence and sleazy characters were not the deterrents. I just did not want to see another flick about the mob, bad cops,drug deals gone bad, shoot 'em up,bust a cap in yo a-- predictabilities or machinations;In other words, another gung ho film with no story,plot or amazing twists.Nor did I want to see another film in which it was all about style and no substance.I was wrong in trying to misjudge this film by literally it's dvd/movie poster artwork cover and the brief summary contents on the back.This film is loaded with disturbing characters of ill will and ill mind to say the least.How is the story and plot? Well, let's just say how many ""bad things"" can happen to a low hand dude in the mob?!He's having a real bad day, folks...Oh, yes, almost forgot to mention;There's a missing gun that plays out like it's value is that of a priceless archeological relic(and with good reason as it fuels the main story).Everybody wants it!You will also feel that there are smaller stories or subplots working at hand.Everything is included from substance,child/spousal abuse,prostitution,pimping to pedophilia.The most sinister and evil of characters you will come across.Oh, yes, you will despise them(casting directors chose superb actors for these additional roles).Yet, each character is not wasted and somehow figures into the bigger picture with the missing gun---well, except for the twist with the pedophile couple which provides more shock and disgust to the already adrenaline jolted system.As for actor Paul Walker, I know he's done other projects but I could only keep associating him with the Fast And The Furious flick.He's a decent actor.There's still room for ""improvement"", maturity and depth to add to his acting credits and skills to his otherwise admirable early/young career.Time will tell.His character portrayal in Running Scared also plays mindgames with the viewer.In one sense, he's a lowly henchman for the mob who is a screw up, but they keep him alive anyway. The next,while not the perfect father or husband will do anything to protect his family.So, here is where the line of the good guy,bad guy role is so blurred...Do you feel sorry or any compassion for the main character? Or is he really no better than the criminal scum he hangs with when away from the family? Again, this is one of the major hooks of the film and it works astoundingly well!Each character might seem exaggerated with dark comic book-like qualities in persona and costume (carciaturistic in nature)Just take a look at the hooker with blue eyeshadow and the pimp in a zoot suit along with various characters and you'll get the drift.You may get the feeling that each sub plot or twisted character is trying to do one better or outdo each other. Again,wrong. You still cannot lose sight of the main character played by Paul Walker or the central plot/story. Also, get ready for the special effects,sound, interesting camera techniques,angles and brooding ""ambiance"" utilized for full overall effect.You may have seen some or all of this done before in other films---there's no doubt about that. Still, it works very well for Running Scared.Nothing is detracted or subtracted.The first few minutes of the opening has a dream or even memory black and white backwash look and feel that captures the attention at that point and hooks you into wanting to discover what led to that particular scene.After that, the next 10 minutes is where you think things are going to be predictable and mundane and then WHAM! Following the rest of the film it's all uphill action,twists and turns.As for the shock ending or conclusion,nope,can't get it out of me;you'll have to see it.If Running Scared doesn't get your adrenaline juices a little on edge or stun you with the characters, then it's time to check the pulse...",4,I Almost Turned Down Watching This !,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,3916,"['friend', 'let', 'borrow', 'dvd.At', 'first', 'was', 'hesistant', 'watch', 'based', 'assumptions', 'had', 'made.No', 'violence', 'sleazy', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'deterrents', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'flick', 'mob', 'bad', 'cops', 'drug', 'deals', 'gone', 'bad', 'shoot', 'up', 'bust', 'cap', 'yo', 'predictabilities', 'machinations', 'other', 'words', 'gung', 'ho', 'film', 'story', 'plot', 'amazing', 'twists.Nor', 'did', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'style', 'substance.I', 'was', 'wrong', 'trying', 'misjudge', 'film', 'literally', 'dvd/movie', 'poster', 'artwork', 'cover', 'brief', 'summary', 'contents', 'back.This', 'film', 'loaded', 'disturbing', 'characters', 'ill', 'will', 'ill', 'mind', 'say', 'least.How', 'story', 'plot', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'how', 'many', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'low', 'hand', 'dude', 'mob', 'having', 'real', 'bad', 'day', 'folks', 'Oh', 'yes', 'almost', 'forgot', 'mention', 'missing', 'gun', 'out', 'value', 'priceless', 'archeological', 'relic', 'good', 'reason', 'main', 'story', '.Everybody', 'will', 'also', 'feel', 'are', 'smaller', 'stories', 'subplots', 'working', 'hand.Everything', 'included', 'substance', 'child/spousal', 'abuse', 'prostitution', 'pimping', 'pedophilia.The', 'most', 'sinister', 'evil', 'characters', 'will', 'come', 'across.Oh', 'yes', 'will', 'despise', 'casting', 'directors', 'chose', 'superb', 'actors', 'additional', 'roles', '.Yet', 'character', 'not', 'wasted', 'somehow', 'figures', 'bigger', 'picture', 'missing', 'gun', '-well', 'twist', 'pedophile', 'couple', 'more', 'shock', 'disgust', 'already', 'adrenaline', 'jolted', 'system.As', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'know', 'done', 'other', 'projects', 'could', 'only', 'keep', 'associating', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'flick.He', 'decent', 'actor.There', 'still', 'room', 'improvement', 'maturity', 'depth', 'add', 'acting', 'credits', 'skills', 'otherwise', 'admirable', 'early/young', 'career.Time', 'will', 'tell.His', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Running', 'Scared', 'also', 'mindgames', 'viewer.In', 'one', 'sense', 'lowly', 'henchman', 'mob', 'who', 'screw', 'up', 'keep', 'alive', 'anyway', 'next', 'not', 'perfect', 'father', 'husband', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'family.So', 'here', 'where', 'line', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'role', 'so', 'blurred', 'Do', 'feel', 'sorry', 'compassion', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'better', 'criminal', 'scum', 'when', 'away', 'family', 'Again', 'one', 'major', 'hooks', 'film', 'astoundingly', 'well', 'character', 'might', 'seem', 'exaggerated', 'dark', 'comic', 'book-like', 'qualities', 'persona', 'costume', 'carciaturistic', 'nature', 'Just', 'take', 'look', 'hooker', 'blue', 'eyeshadow', 'pimp', 'zoot', 'suit', 'various', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'get', 'drift.You', 'may', 'get', 'feeling', 'sub', 'plot', 'twisted', 'character', 'trying', 'do', 'one', 'better', 'outdo', 'other', 'Again', 'wrong', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'lose', 'sight', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'central', 'plot/story', 'Also', 'get', 'ready', 'special', 'effects', 'sound', 'interesting', 'camera', 'techniques', 'angles', 'brooding', 'ambiance', 'utilized', 'full', 'overall', 'effect.You', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'done', 'other', 'films', 'doubt', 'Still', 'very', 'well', 'Running', 'Scared.Nothing', 'detracted', 'subtracted.The', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'opening', 'dream', 'even', 'memory', 'black', 'white', 'backwash', 'look', 'feel', 'attention', 'point', 'hooks', 'wanting', 'discover', 'what', 'led', 'particular', 'scene.After', 'next', '10', 'minutes', 'where', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'predictable', 'mundane', 'then', 'WHAM', 'Following', 'rest', 'film', 'uphill', 'action', 'twists', 'turns.As', 'shock', 'ending', 'conclusion', 'nope', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'it.If', 'Running', 'Scared', ""n't"", 'get', 'adrenaline', 'little', 'edge', 'stun', 'characters', 'then', 'time', 'check', 'pulse']",N/A

I haven't felt this kind of excitement in years.  It's about Paul Walker, who's the father of a son, realizes that his son's friend (who lives next door) stole a gun from Paul's basement, and after an incident involving a shooting, Paul runs over to the neighbors house to find out what happened (actually, he thought someone in that house deliberately shot through his living room window, but quickly finds out that wasn't the case).  Paul soon realizes that the kid took off running, and then Paul has to find him because it's VERY important for Paul to get the gun back.The storyline is one long twist after another, never letting up throughout the film.  Some scenes are incredibly violent and bloody, while others are just deeply disturbing.  You really feel sorry for the little kid (the friend of Paul's son) throughout the film because of all the incredible and tragic events he is forced to experience in just one night.

The movie itself was great not because of Paul Walker, but in spite of him. The story centers around a low-level mobster that is given the task of disposing of the guns used in an accidental murder of a crooked cop. The ""cops"" raid a high stakes drug deal wearing masks and sporting sawn-off shotguns. One thing leads to another and the mobsters kill their would be robbers only to find out at least one was a cop. The story evolves from there with the main plot being one of the guns Paul Walker's character was supposed to get rid of ends up in his 10 year old neighbors hands. The boy shoots his step-father and flees leaving Walker to chse/hunt him down. I was shocked at how much I liked this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone, even if you don't normaly enjoy this type of flick. I saw the preview and thought ""Oh-boy it's another one of those movies"".

That realization hits one hard when they see a performance like the one Paul gave in this film. I thought for sure I was going to witness the usual, run-of-the-mill mob-type movie when I pushed play. Instead, what I got, was a film that was well-written, excellently acted and left me wondering what in the world was going to happen next! Halfway through viewing, all I could think about was how much trouble one lost gun could cause. By the end, it was a movie that was so much more than the lost gun. I'm not ashamed to say I shed some tears at certain points. One scene that particularly got to me dealt with Teresa and her attempt to rescue Oleg. I won't spoil for those who haven't yet watched it, but it definitely was powerful.It saddens me that I didn't pay closer attention to Paul's career while he was still alive. It saddens me that he won't get the chance to give more top-notch performances.The film is a bit of an oddball, veering in directions that don't always make sense or that feel like they don't necessarily belong. While I normally go, &#34;WTF?&#34; when movies do this, it seemed to fit in this film. It was out there at times, but it worked.

Before I saw ""Running Scared"" I was far from being a Paul Walker Fan, to me he just seemed like all of the other un-talented action actors that is supposed to help put butts in seats but suprisingly, overall he was alot of fun to watch and did a good job in his leading role.I thought that the film was unique in switching back and forth between people telling them they're specific storys, background and attitude. Also i though that is was very cool how every scene seemed to be completely different from the last, you never knew what was going to happen next which I think really makes the veiwer wonder and completely enjoy a guessing game that lies within the film.My personal favorite part of the film was the Child molester scene I though it really brought something new to the film that no other scene did which was horror, though the film was suspenceful I thought that one part of the film really played a major part in suspence and horror that really helped the film to be quite good.Though it can be bloody it isnt doesnt have that disturbing quality other than the child molester scene which has no blood, whoever compared it to ""Kill Bill"" is quite an idiot to be honest, they are completely different in just about every way. Though good, honestly it really isnt anything special...Recommended none the less, it's really alot of funGrade: B",4,"Fun, Fast-Paced Thriller",1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,1773,"['really', 'dont', 'think', 'Running', 'Scared', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'look', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'still', 'think', 'quite', 'alot', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'packed', 'fun', 'though', 'sometimes', 'Running', 'Scared', 'may', 'confuse', 'audiences', 'introduction/beginning', 'lead', 'believe', 'somewhat', 'jumbled', 'great', 'job', 're-gathering', 'middle', 'delivering', 'fun', 'understandable', 'ending', 'saw', 'Running', 'Scared', 'was', 'far', 'being', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Fan', 'just', 'seemed', 'other', 'un-talented', 'action', 'actors', 'supposed', 'help', 'put', 'butts', 'seats', 'suprisingly', 'overall', 'was', 'alot', 'fun', 'watch', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'leading', 'role.I', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'unique', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'people', 'telling', ""'re"", 'specific', 'storys', 'background', 'attitude', 'Also', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'how', 'scene', 'seemed', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'last', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'think', 'really', 'veiwer', 'wonder', 'completely', 'enjoy', 'guessing', 'game', 'film.My', 'personal', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'Child', 'molester', 'scene', 'really', 'brought', 'something', 'new', 'film', 'other', 'scene', 'did', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'suspenceful', 'thought', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'played', 'major', 'part', 'suspence', 'horror', 'really', 'helped', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'can', 'be', 'bloody', 'isnt', 'doesnt', 'have', 'disturbing', 'quality', 'other', 'child', 'molester', 'scene', 'blood', 'whoever', 'compared', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'quite', 'idiot', 'be', 'honest', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'just', 'way', 'good', 'honestly', 'really', 'anything', 'special', 'Recommended', 'none', 'less', 'really', 'alot', 'funGrade', 'B']",N/A

But that being said, his performance in this flick, not to mention that of the entire cast, totally blew me away.Initially I thought this was going to be just another shoot 'em up mob movie, happily I was wrong.  The primary storyline has Walker playing a low level mob guy, Joey, charged with getting rid of his boss Tommy's (played by the deliciously dark Johnny Messner) pistol that was used to, unknowingly at the time, kill a bunch of dirty cobs.  When the gun disappears all hell breaks loose as Joey races against the clock to recover the gun before Tommy and the rest of the mob boys find out it was ever gone.  On that level, it coulda just been another lame shoot 'em up movie, but the subplot involving the screen stealing Cameron Bright's character, and his involvement with the missing gun, is what truly makes the movie take off and sets it apart from action movies of this genre.That being said, there are a few lags in the pace during the middle of the film, but not enough to truly detract from the film.  Some people have commented on the pedophile couple possibly pushing the dark theme of the movie too far, but I personally thought it fit right in.  While the rest of the characters in the film were blatantly dark, links to the mob, prostitution, etc, some of them also have their redeeming qualities.  Then we have this couple that show up in their bright colored clothes, eerily cheerful demeanor, and they end up being quite possibly the most evil people in the film. Looks can be deceiving.All in all this was a great movie to watch, although the ending was a little bit predictable, and the reason I'd give it only 4.5 out of 5 stars.

For the Amazon price, you can't really go wrong.  There are a multitude of various styles to compare to when talking about modern day crime dramas.  Even the bulk of the ""Boston/Irish/Brother"" themed ones all have a different mood, angle and pace depending on the script and the producer.What makes Running scared great is the fact they tell a story that has a multitude of segments without getting the viewer lost.  Each theme is heavy and thought consuming, without coming out of it's compartment to make the other ones feel like they have less impact on the overall tale.  It's dark, but at times it has great humor.  It's action packed, while still allowing for sentiment and meaningful dialogue which adds to the character's plight.And speaking of characters, this one is full of them.

Maybe it's the characters, none of which are really fleshed out beyond a series of grimaces and gunshots---there is a flat 2-dimensional cartoonish quality to it all which keeps you from REALLY caring about what happens to them (possible exception of Cameron Bright as the little Russian kid and the winsome Vera Farmiga as Mrs. Gazelle).

It was an urban fantasy movie starring Paul Walker. Personally, I didn't care for the movie, but evidently a lot of people thought it was really great. First of all, the movie was done in the F-speak dialect of American English to the point that it really required normal English sub-titles so that a viewer not well versed in F-speak could understand what was going on.Do you enjoy creepy characters in a harsh urban environment? I mean, really, really creepy. Well, this is your kind of movie. I don't know which was the creepiest, the cops or the assorted mobsters. Oh yes, and there was a couple pedophiles tossed into the mix. Lets call it a three-way tie. Anyway, the main character was trusted with a pistol involved in a murder. He had promised to take care of it, but he lost it. Actually, his small boy lifted it from it's hiding place. Thereafter followed a frantic search for the pistol with the guy, a couple mafia families and the police all trying to find the incriminating weapon. The gun's location was unknowingly wrapped up with two small boys, one that never smiled. The whole thing was nonsense, of course. The movie is a fantasy of the worst kind in a gritty big-city atmosphere. It's filled with lots of action, mayhem, foul language and assorted violence. If you're looking for something meaningful, you might seek out another movie. Alas, I'm apologetic, I possibly might have understood the movie better if they only had those subtitles for the F-speak.The acting, by the way, was rather good. The filming was good and the action moved along at a brisk pace. The death and destruction leaned toward the spectacular, if that's your thing.Gary Peterson",3,Good Filming. Brisk Action.

983406,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000F5WR4W,General Zombie,"[3, 4]","Not much to say here. This movie is crazy.  Eerie, expressionistic lighting, tons of steadicam and long takes and just generally wild cinematography. It's really quite a technical marvel. The plot is insane and charges from one ludicrous situation to the next, all feauturing countless twisted, hyper-bizarre characters. The director compares the gunshot through a window which sets off most of the action to Alice's going through the mirror, and that totally makes some sense; from this point on the film takes place in a nightmarish world of the grotesque where Oleg runs afoul of all sorts of unsavory characters associated with urban streets. Not real world versions of these people, however. Nightmare versions.I could try and get into the plot a bit more specifically, but it's honestly hard to describe. Here's a little: Joey is a mob errand boy who fails to dispose of a gun properly, and neighbor boy Oleg steals it, then proceeds to shoot his crazy father with it. He runs off and Joey has to catch him and they go through a long, long night together were all kinda crazy stuff happens. It's not about plot; it's about the energy and the visual style,the tons of graphic violence and the nice touches of black humor. (Ex: There's a killer/abuser couple that makes videos of their victims, each DVD case marked with the kids name and a star rating. Now that's black.)  While it's all fairly compelling, ""Running Scared"" has a number of individual scenes which are particularly awesome, like the ultra-gruesome shootout at the beginning, Oleg's father's inexplicable monologue on John Wayne and Oleg's and Teresa's adventure in the home of a seemingly wholesome couple who do, well, all sorts of bad stuff.The performances are surprisingly strong, particularly from Walker, who I've never cared for. He proves himself a capable action star here, even if he mostly just runs around and yells and curses at people. Course, that's what being an action star consists of. He just needs to be intense, and that's what he is. Vera Farmiga is also very good as his wife in a role that could've easily been very perfunctory and pointless. Cameron Bright doesn't really do all that much as Oleg, he mostly just runs away and never smiles, but he's believable enough. People will tell you this movie is exploitive of children, but I don't really see it. Twelve year old's aren't so naive that they're gonna learn anything new from this movie.On the downside, it's may be a little too long and slows down a few times too many times. The whole idea behind this movie is how bizarre and relentless it is, so slowing down having people talk doesn't help things much. On the other hand, maybe it'd be too much if it had never let up. Who knows.Anyway, if you want something really stylish and whacked out and gruesome and offensive, this is the movie for you. If you worry too much about a movie being plausible and coherent, well this may not be your thing.

But attempt to put the movie on 'slow forward' and this hundred miles an hour paced film has a fine sense of pacing and excellent experimental photography, AND a cast that is up to it. Writer/Director knows this genre well and offers up a polished little frightening film.Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker, finally given a role in which he proves he indeed can act and carry a film!)lives with his wife (Vera Farmiga) and son (Alex Neuberger) and is an apparent mob flunky who hides weapons in his basement to protect the mob.  But when one certain pistol, used in severely wounding a cop, is recovered by the next door neighbor's kid Oleg (Cameron Bright) and is used against his abusive Russian father Anzor (Karel Roden, a terrific character actor as well as fine eye candy), the chase begins: Joey must recover the gun at all costs and it is this wild crash of violent events involving mobs, bad cops (Chaz Palminteri), hookers and child molesters that frames the course of the film.  And to top it off there is a fine surprise ending.Paul Walker is excellent and it is good to see a film that is a worthy challenge for his talent as an actor.  The entire cast of supporting actors, while they do little but be violent, is fine and the cinematography by Jim Whitaker is creative (at times a bit too creative bordering on kitsch!) and musical score my Mark Isham complete the compelling atmosphere of this surprisingly exciting film.

That movie wasn't great, he wasn't great and that story wasn't great. It got him on the map.  Since then, he's become kind of the go-to guy for interesting pretty boy roles, showing up in movies like Timeline, Joy Ride and The Skulls.Having said that, and having discounted the guy, I went to see Into The Blue and was stunned by the movie. It was a pretty movie. The ocean, Jessica Albe, Walker and the cinematography were all excellent. The story was actually very good and for once, Paul Walker impressed me.In Running Scared, he shocked the heck out of me. Where did he learn to act? This was a good movie, a really good movie. Its like Reservoir Dogs on a crystal meth tweak session, combining elements from Usual Suspects and (interestingly) Spike Jonz. The tricks played by the director are fun, interesting and they do further the story.The story isn't anything new. Walker is a low level hood who is given a dirty gun to dispose of. He hides it, telling his wife that the gun, with a dozen others, are their insurance policy. His 10 year old son sees him hide it with his friend and the guns get out in the world.Needless to say, he probably should have bought insurance instead. NOTHING goes right and this movie, which isn't horror, features a world where everything is horrible. Everything is lit oddly, and yet appropriately. The normal looking couple can be just having coffee or be on the make for prey. Shadows can reveal demons. Decisions get made to kill and they are absolutely right.This movie kicked my butt, made me smile and (surprise) made me look forward to whatever movie Paul Walker is going to do next.

983422,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000F5WR4W,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 3]","""Running Scared"" defines Cinema Extreme. Why this film didn't do better at the box office is both sad and puzzling. Writer/director Wayne Kramer works both the story and the camera in weird new ways that make the film engaging. He truly sticks to his guns on delivering one of the most uncompromising, memorable and downright brutal thrillers in recent memory.I wasn't expecting much from this movie with Paul Walker as the star attraction, but this movie was thoroughly entertaining. Walker is surprisingly impressive considering the strictly one-dimensional roles he played in movies such as `The Fast And The Furious' and `Into The Blue.' Here he plays Joey as someone well aware of his impending death should he fail, and throughout he is totally watch able and believable. Cameron Bright steals the show every time he appears on screen, that boy is so talented.The story might flag at times, particularly in the middle of the film, but Kramer is not afraid to play with the camera-work to keep the audience's attention - whip-pans, CSI-style extreme close-ups, super slow-motion, sepia filters and color bleaching are all used to give the film a gritty and somewhat unique look - take, for instance, the kitchen shooting about half an hour into the film, played from multiple viewpoints in both forward and reverse.The film's charcoal-dark tone may be too relentless for some viewers, and the pedophile subplot could be considered as taking things one step too far, but as long as you've got a strong stomach and can face hearing lashings of creative swearing, there's a lot of enjoyment to be found here. Unbearably tense, visually inventive and superbly acted from start to finish, `Running Scared' is great action/thriller. For some this may not be the best movie ever made, but out of thousands of movies I've seen, this one falls into my most memorable one.",4,This movie is RAW and not for children,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,1867,"['Running', 'Scared', 'Cinema', 'Extreme', 'Why', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'sad', 'puzzling', 'Writer/director', 'Wayne', 'Kramer', 'story', 'camera', 'weird', 'new', 'ways', 'make', 'film', 'engaging', 'truly', 'guns', 'delivering', 'one', 'most', 'uncompromising', 'memorable', 'downright', 'brutal', 'thrillers', 'recent', 'memory.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'star', 'attraction', 'movie', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'Walker', 'surprisingly', 'impressive', 'considering', 'strictly', 'one-dimensional', 'roles', 'played', 'movies', 'such', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Blue', 'Here', 'Joey', 'someone', 'well', 'aware', 'impending', 'death', 'should', 'fail', 'totally', 'watch', 'able', 'believable', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'show', 'time', 'screen', 'boy', 'so', 'talented.The', 'story', 'might', 'flag', 'times', 'particularly', 'middle', 'film', 'Kramer', 'not', 'afraid', 'play', 'camera-work', 'keep', 'audience', 'attention', 'whip-pans', 'CSI-style', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'super', 'slow-motion', 'sepia', 'filters', 'color', 'bleaching', 'are', 'used', 'give', 'film', 'gritty', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'look', 'take', 'instance', 'kitchen', 'shooting', 'hour', 'film', 'played', 'multiple', 'viewpoints', 'forward', 'reverse.The', 'film', 'charcoal-dark', 'tone', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'relentless', 'viewers', 'pedophile', 'subplot', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'taking', 'things', 'one', 'step', 'too', 'far', 'as', 'long', ""'ve"", 'got', 'strong', 'stomach', 'can', 'face', 'hearing', 'lashings', 'creative', 'swearing', 'lot', 'enjoyment', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Unbearably', 'tense', 'visually', 'inventive', 'superbly', 'acted', 'start', 'finish', 'Running', 'Scared', 'great', 'action/thriller', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'thousands', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'one']",N/A

I don't know if it makes ""Kill Bill look like Sesame Street"", but it's definitely an action packed thrill-ride. Paul Walker (8 Below, Meet the Deedles) plays Joey, a mob hand who is given the job of disposing of a hot gun. It's made clear from the beginning that Joey is a bit of a screw up. He takes the gun home and sits down with his family to eat, when a gunshot rings out next door. As Joey quickly investigates, he realizes his son's friend Oleg (Cameron Bright, 'Birth') has stolen the gun and used it to shoot his step-father. Desparately searching for the gun, we also follow Oleg through several difficult situations. Some involve junkies, pedophilic child killers, and pimps. The movie is that rare movie thatt hooks you to the screen every minute, it's never dull or boring. The story is genuinely interesting, the acting isn't bad, and the pedophile's house is really disturbing. It looks like Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson decorated a house together.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[7, 8]","Running Scared was one of those movies that I wanted to see but it slipped my mind cause the preview didn't hook me that much. When I saw it in the video store I had to grab it. The most surprising thing about this movie is Paul Walker, he is a mediocre actor if you ask me but in his defense he's been in a lot of teen flicks the past few years. In his most memorable role The Fast and the Furious he was outshined by Vin Diesel but Walker didn't put up much of a fight for best actor in that film. To get to the point Paul Walker showed his true potential in Running Scared. Not only was his character written very well but he played it right to perfection, you seriously forget he's Paul Walker and start to believe he's Joey Gazelle. The cinematography is amazing, it's very detailed and unique to give those violent scenes that extra something to keep you into it. There's a lot of slow motion, rewinds, and visual close ups to let the power really hit and effect you.The story is about Joey Gazelle who is involved with the mob but his role with them isn't important until he messes up and lets a very important gun that was involved in the killing of some cops go missing. He then realizes that the gun is in the hands of his son's friend who is getting abused at home and is ready to do something about it. Of all the guns in that house the kid picks that one. Now you're in for a ride and your destination is wherever the gun is going and believe me the gun goes everywhere. The best part of Running Scared is the end when you're revealed the truth about everything including Paul Walker and why he really needs that gun. Everything about this movie is deceiving so don't be surprised if you think you have this film figured out and you realize you were completely wrong. Full of twists and crazy switches the cast follows perfectly and they don't let you down.

983432,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B000F5WR4W,Kevin F. Tasker,"[0, 0]","Running Scared is a masterful exploitation film. Every scene vibrates with manic tension. The gore flows in explosive gouts. There is full frontal nudity. The f bomb is dropped more than every characters' name combined.  All the while, the camera seizures about capturing every action with a dozen angles. Yes it even flies bullet time style through a slice of flying bread.Every character in RS is monstrously repellent, cartoony and/or powered by insane momentum. The plot is paper thin but involves a runaway kid with a stolen gun. Paul Walker, aptly named Joey Gazelle, must hunt him down. In one night. Alone.Meanwhile an entire seedy city-full of crooked ghouls give chase or stumble into his path by accident. The list includes: natty mobster-like cops, shadowy addicts and unassuming child rapist/murderers, the latter of which villains temporarily derail the plot in a scene of literally unfathomable suspense. That scene is lit so yellow and bright, so fierce and unsettling, it would make Kubrick blush. And the reveal of the killers' motive references such depravity and evil it makes a later scene of someone getting tortured by hockey players a relief for its restraint.Oh did I mention the lights-out battle with a torch wielding maniac? How about the scene where someone holds a gun on a woman holding a crying baby? Or the dryer-top cunnilingus that both excites and endears, coming off as...well, loving. There is also revolting misogyny in which two women are casually brutalized in close up. And so on. The extent that children are put in peril in this movie is rather unconscionable. But if you can overlook that, and a scene of kind of romanticized American nationalism, you will have a wonderful time.Virtually every scene is pulse-pounding.Vera Farmiga turns in perhaps her best performance, the rage and pity in her eyes offsets Paul Walker's acting which is a cut above his usual work but more or less consists of him either, glaring, swearing or smacking walls, sometimes all at once. He often seems to not so much act as wait his turn. Regardless, he owns it. Everyone owns it, especially director Kramer, whose gritty prowess here rivals Tarantino or Stone.

I mean, Paul Walker isn't anybody's idea of an actor. But I was bored as all h*** the day I walked in to the video store, and it was either between this, or Underworld: Evolution. And anyway, I loved director Wayne Kramer's 'The Cooler', so I thought what the heck. Took the chance. And boy, oh boy...The setup is, uh, fast and furious - sorry. A drug deal between some gangsters and mafiosos goes wrong. Badly. Dirty cops get shot, and mobster Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker) is charged to get rid of a tainted gun - a distinctive, silver-plated, snub-nosed .38. Gazelle takes the gun home and hides it in his basement, where his son and his son's best friend, Oleg, watch from hiding. Oleg steals the gun and shoots his abusive, meth-making, Russian Mobster stepfather, then disappears. Joey quickly figures out what happened and bolts after Oleg, hunting for the missing gun. The mobsters - Russian and Italian - and the dirty cops are following right behind, nervous and trigger-happy.Once Oleg goes on the run the movie jacks into high gear; and like Alice dropping through the rabbit-hole and her surreal journey, Oleg meets menacing characters every step of the way: from the faceless crack-addict to the psychotic wanna-be pimp Lester, to the real, insideous evil of the pedophile couple.Running Scared is as much a grown up fairy tale as it is a mobster or suspense movie. If you're squeamish at all, forget about it. The writing is spot-on, and I didn't spot the Big Twist until right when I was supposed to, which for this jaded old movie hound is saying something. Director Kramer has a knack for creating dark, violent, disturbing worlds where - much like real life - nobody is innocent and not even children are spared. As a star, Walker won't make anyone forget Steve McQueen any time soon, but he's pretty damn good here, believably portraying Joey's mounting frenzy over always being just one step behind Oleg and one step ahead of the bloodthirsty killers.The DVD extras weren't bad either: the usual behind-the-scenes back-slapping is here, but Kramer also gleefully throws in some really fascinating movie making techniques - my favorites showing how he shot the reverse gunshot/window scene (without the use of CG), and the swirling camera shot with Oleg in the pedophile playroom. Amazing, creative stuff.My only complaint, the one thing that kept me from giving Running Scared a full five-star rating, came at the very end, with a scene that was so far out whack with the tone of the rest of the film that it felt tacked on as a concession to the studio. But overall, this is a great third effort from a really talented filmmaker. And don't compare this guy to Tarantino. As much as there are some similarities - mostly in genre choice and all-out violent, kinetic energy - Kramer is in a class by himself.

983434,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000F5WR4W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 3]","Within the first few minutes of ""Running Scared""--the watchable, but luridly over-the-top crime story by Wayne Kramer--I knew we were in very familiar territory. This ridiculous bit of fancy reminded me instantly of the hyperactive, over-stylized work of Tony Scott. Unfortunately, though, it was far closer (but not as pretentious) to Scott's mind-numbing ""Domino"" than his witty and intricate ""True Romance."" However, for whatever reason, audiences seem to be responding to this film. Like a live action video game, ""Running Scared"" doesn't really offer us anything new--but it does pile up lots and lots and lots of action, coincidences, jagged editing and noise. It's easy enough to watch the images blaze by--but, in all seriousness, you must shut your mind down to logic or believability.Within the first 30 minutes of ""Running Scared,"" we're treated to a cops and bad guys massacre, domestic abuse with a shooting, an unsavory drug park massacre, and a sadistic pimp beating his lady for getting a GED. This is one rough town! The plot, such as it is, starts out with the aforementioned cops versus bad guys massacre--but of course, it's a squad of corrupt, murdering cops. Paul Walker (as one of the surviving bad guys) is tasked to get rid of the weapons used. He hides them in his house, where a neighbor child steals a gun which is then used in the domestic abuse shooting. Walker, fearful that the gun will be linked to the massacre, must get it back. In the process of finding the kid (Cameron Bright), he must evade good cops, bad cops, and his own group who suspect he messed up by not properly disposing of the weapons.The remainder of the movie is a high octane chase with characters bumping into each other in outrageously unbelievable ways. Everything that can be twisted into a convoluted mess is--as Bright wanders the city (this horrible, horrible city) finding every ounce of evil ever created. The most inspired bit of lunacy finds Bright captured by [...]/child killers. You'll never guess how they get him--oh, let's not spoil the surprise. There isn't too much more to say, but the violence and killings continue unabated. I was especially impressed by Walker's ability to withstand pain. At one point, where realistically ever bone in his face would be broken, he wants to get some breakfast. My kind of guy!I know many people will find all this excessiveness fun. And I have nothing against this type of movie. But from the whimsical cartoons that are featured over the closing credits--one can surmise that there was supposed to be humor in this tale. If that had been done more effectively, I think I might have enjoyed things a bit more. But as played, the overwrought violence played out seriously. So, frankly, I've seen better and more creative examples of this type of film. Kramer is not untalented. His ""The Cooler"" with William H. Macy is a nice and different sleeper, and ""Mindhunters"" plays similarly to this film--somewhat fun with macabre violence, if you don't think about it.

He hides it in his basement where his young son and his best friend see him.  Friend Oleg steals the gun and uses it to shoot his mother's abusive Russian husband, his stepfather.  Oleg of course runs off with the gun and the chase begins to find the gun and save Walker's hide in the process.

I was wrong, because the truth is that ""Running Scared"" is far above your typical action movies.  It goes over the top again and again, and just when you think they can't push it any further, they drop another bomb on you when you're not expecting it.The movie told simply; Joey runs with a pack of mob criminals and fixes up their messes when they need cleaning up.  A drug deal goes terribly wrong when it is raided by men in ski masks.  A shoot-out happens and the bad news is that the men in the masks, they're cops.  Dirty cops, but cops no less.  Now, Joey has to make sure the gun is never found by anybody, but before he gets the chance to hide it, it's found by his son's best friend.  With the gun ""hot"" and loose on the street, Joey has to recover it and the kid before the mob finds out what has happened and wants his head to roll.That is only the basics of it.  The movie is really all over the place, throwing its characters into one bad place after another.  The quest to find the gun and the kid ain't an easy one, as you run into just about every despicable type of thug and criminal you can think of.  There are very few breaks that allow you to collect yourself and take a breath.  The action is very fast-paced and the body count and number of gruesomely violent deaths is at an all time high.  Of course, you still get time to get familiar with the major players and get some pretty interesting storylines.It must be said, this movie is BRUTAL.  Brutally, brutally violent in every sense of the word.  I am shocked that this movie was able to get an ""R"" rating, as I have never seen the boundaries pushed like this in a rated movie.  It's also very dark and offers some horrifically disturbing situations--one in particular involves the kid getting picked up by a seemingly ""nice"" couple, and I'll leave it at that.  This movie is definitely not for everybody.  It will disgust many, and perhaps most.  Others may not like it because it's not all that logical.  Yet, the movie's violence and action is so animated, so over the top and so exaggerated that it sets up this world where all of the rules are thrown out the window, and we buy into that.  This means that the overall plot is not that perfect, but plot is really the last thing you watch this movie for.Paul Walker does a great job of playing the leading man in this movie.  He was able to show that he could hang in an action flick with ""The Fast and the Furious,"" but this is probably his most challenging and demanding role when it comes to doing an action picture.  He doesn't look superhuman, which lets you believe that at any time he can be a goner, which makes it more exciting and thrilling.  The whole cast should get kudos for their roles.  It helps us buy into the movie a whole lot more.  The DVD features a behind-the-scenes look, commentary from the writer/director and storyboards.  Also, a couple of these include a small graphic novel based on the movie.""Running Scared"" makes ""Man on Fire"" and ""A History of Violence"" look like a kiddy cartoon.  It takes action movies into a whole new level that I have never witnessed before.  It's outrageous, it's shocking, it's brutal and it's not always logical, but it is visually stunning and undeniably entertaining.  Again, be warned that this is an extremely dark and violent picture that a lot of people won't be able to stomach.  Proceed with extreme caution, but don't forget to enjoy it and repeat to yourself it's only a movie.  - Michael Crane",4,One of the most brutal and shocking action flicks I have EVER seen...,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,3793,"['When', 'saw', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'top', 'had', 'complete', 'awe', 'well', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'something', ""'d"", 'have', 'look', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'commercials', 'just', 'seemed', 'typical', 'hack', 'action', 'movie', 'would', 'ultimately', 'be', 'disappointing', 'was', 'wrong', 'truth', 'Running', 'Scared', 'far', 'typical', 'action', 'movies', 'top', 'again', 'again', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'push', 'further', 'drop', 'bomb', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'it.The', 'movie', 'told', 'simply', 'Joey', 'pack', 'mob', 'criminals', 'fixes', 'up', 'messes', 'when', 'need', 'cleaning', 'up', 'drug', 'deal', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'when', 'raided', 'men', 'ski', 'masks', 'shoot-out', 'happens', 'bad', 'news', 'men', 'masks', ""'re"", 'cops', 'Dirty', 'cops', 'less', 'Now', 'Joey', 'make', 'sure', 'gun', 'never', 'found', 'anybody', 'chance', 'hide', 'found', 'son', 'best', 'friend', 'gun', 'hot', 'loose', 'street', 'Joey', 'recover', 'kid', 'mob', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'head', 'roll.That', 'only', 'basics', 'movie', 'really', 'place', 'throwing', 'characters', 'one', 'bad', 'place', 'quest', 'find', 'gun', 'kid', 'ai', ""n't"", 'easy', 'one', 'run', 'just', 'despicable', 'type', 'thug', 'criminal', 'can', 'think', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'breaks', 'allow', 'collect', 'take', 'breath', 'action', 'very', 'fast-paced', 'body', 'count', 'number', 'gruesomely', 'violent', 'deaths', 'time', 'high', 'course', 'still', 'get', 'time', 'get', 'familiar', 'major', 'players', 'get', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'storylines.It', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'BRUTAL', 'Brutally', 'brutally', 'violent', 'sense', 'word', 'am', 'shocked', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'R', 'rating', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'boundaries', 'pushed', 'rated', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'dark', 'horrifically', 'disturbing', 'situations', 'one', 'particular', 'involves', 'kid', 'getting', 'picked', 'up', 'seemingly', 'nice', 'couple', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'everybody', 'will', 'disgust', 'many', 'perhaps', 'most', 'Others', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'not', 'logical', 'movie', 'violence', 'action', 'so', 'animated', 'so', 'top', 'so', 'exaggerated', 'up', 'world', 'where', 'rules', 'are', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'buy', 'overall', 'plot', 'not', 'perfect', 'plot', 'really', 'last', 'thing', 'watch', 'movie', 'for.Paul', 'Walker', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'leading', 'man', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'show', 'could', 'hang', 'action', 'flick', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'probably', 'most', 'challenging', 'demanding', 'role', 'when', 'doing', 'action', 'picture', ""n't"", 'look', 'superhuman', 'believe', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'goner', 'more', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'whole', 'cast', 'should', 'get', 'kudos', 'roles', 'buy', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'DVD', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'storyboards', 'Also', 'couple', 'include', 'small', 'graphic', 'novel', 'based', 'movie', 'Running', 'Scared', 'Man', 'Fire', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'look', 'kiddy', 'cartoon', 'action', 'movies', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'have', 'never', 'witnessed', 'before', 'outrageous', 'shocking', 'brutal', 'not', 'always', 'logical', 'visually', 'stunning', 'undeniably', 'entertaining', 'Again', 'be', 'warned', 'extremely', 'dark', 'violent', 'picture', 'lot', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'stomach', 'Proceed', 'extreme', 'caution', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'enjoy', 'repeat', 'yourself', 'only', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

First, if you like the concept of Crash, that everything is linked or related, you will love this movie. Second, if you want to see a movie that has action, suspense and some intense characters, you will love this movie.Joey (played by Paul Walker) is told to get rid of a gun that was used during a very horrific crime. Unfortunately, things spin out of control when his son, Nick and an abused neighbor, Oleg take the gun. Tired of his father abusing him and his mother, Oleg shots his father. There are a series of misadventures involving the gun, Oleg and Joey's attempt to regain possession of the gun, but eventually the watcher sees where every event is linked and the impact of this one incident has repercussions on all of the characters involved. And there are some particularly disturbing scenes when Oleg mistakenly gets into the wrong car trying to escape his father.

The film is written and directed by Wayne Kramer, the same guy who brought us the surprisingly good and stylish The Cooler, but when watching Running Scared, you'll never think that this movie can come from the same guy.  Paul Walker plays Joey, a low level mob hood who is charged with the disposal of a gun that was used to ventilate a cop.  Next thing you know, his kid and neighbor Oleg (Cameron Bright) discover the weapon which Oleg later uses on his abusive stepfather (Karel Roden).  Now Joey has a barrage of mobsters, crooked cops, pimps, drug dealers, euro-trash, and more on his tail.  Yeah, the story itself takes a back seat to Kramer's ultra stylish and ultra violent set pieces which continuously up the ante in terms of bloodshed.  One scene in particular involving hockey pucks is worth the price of admission alone, but as a whole Running Scared fails.  While Kramer's got style to spare, his leading man is what ultimately ruins the film.  Paul Walker is not a good actor by any stretch of the imagination.  His frequent over-acting is nerve grating, while Kramer's script features plenty of corny dialogue and an abundance of swearing that would make a sailor blush.  The rest of the cast, which includes Chazz Palminteri, Johnny Messner, and the Departed's Vera Farmiga, are also wasted as well.

About the only thing it accomplished was being loud.  I beleive the cameraman on the opening robbery scene must have been on crack, because he couldn't hold the camera still worth a darn.  At first I thought this was just going to be the style of the movie-a la traffic or something.  No--it was just during that scene.  The special effects team seemed to have Sin City envy and they try to copy their style.  Note to director: it's not so impressive the second time around--ask the Matrix people.As for the story, they could have easily cut about thirty minutes from this script-if they just stuck to what was essential to the story.  The homeless guy in the park-the shoot out in the john at the park, the white mac daddy pimp, the Gloria wannabe (hooker with the heart of gold), the weirdo couple making children pornography (though I enjoyed what happened to them-but retrospect, it had nothing to do with nothing), the russian wife confessing why she can't leave her husband. *this particularly bothered me.  We see this man knocking her down and doing these horrible things, but somehow since he can't quite bring himself to kill her-he's an un-sung hero* pleeze!  Then, of course, we have an ending on top of an ending on top of an ending.  Frankly, I believe they should have yelled 'it's a wrap' after the confusing hockey rink scene.  I still don't know what the heck that whole thing was about.  Someone was covering up for someone and someone told somebody else something else.  I have no idea.But what do I know.Plus, the whole night is about getting to that gun--and in the end, it becomes absolete-meaningless.  The pimps walks in with the gun after all the bad guys are dead and then we have to endure ONE more gun fighting scene that pits a gun against a knife.  And miraculously, the knife wins.  Since the director knew he couldn't actually pull such a fight off, the audience never actually *sees* that particular fight.Then it's the whole, 'I have to get home before I die' scene.  Then the Russian woman decides to kill herself since she no longer has her husband to push her around.  And I forget, why did she do this?

What I liked about Running Scared is that it kept my attention almost the entire time, and if a movie can do that to me it has to be a really good flick. I don't want to give the details of the movie away since many reviewes have done that, and I don't want to ruin it for those who have not seen it. I will say this movie is intense and throws some major stuff at you that makes you at times find it very hard to watch. The movie is filmed very different than most movies today and it has sort of a raw feel to it. Paul Walker does a truly amazing job in his performance and deserves an OSCAR or at least a Oscar nomination for his performance. That may sound far fetched to some doubters, but really he is that good. He shows when given great material he can be one hell of an actor. He truly embodies this character and to see him with this high stress level throughout the movie and be able to maintain it just makes me respect his acting more than I thought I ever could. TO be honest I am surprised the movie got an R rating and not a Unrated or NC-17 rating. The movie has more bad words than any movie I can remember in recent memory. As for the blood and violence there is quite a bit, but it is done with a purpose and not just for the sake of being violence.

'Running Scared' is not to be confused with the 80's movie by the same title starring Gregory Hines and Billy Crystal.  This is a completely different storyline, and there is no comedy involved whatsoever.'Running Scared' is the tale of Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker), who handles weapons disposal for the illicit actions of his friends.  But when a gun is used to eliminate a crooked cop, Joey treats it as casually as he treats all his charges, putting it in plastic and hiding it in his house.  But this time, he is seen by his son Nicky and neighbor boy Oleg Yugorsky (Cameron Bright - The Butterfly Effect).Oleg takes the gun and shoots his abusive stepfather Anzor (Expertly played by Karel Roden - The Bourne Supremacy, 15 Minutes, and Hellboy).  Now, Joey not only has to find the gun, but protect Oleg and Nicky from being discovered by his mob connections, and still produce the gun for his benefactors.This movie is a non-stop thriller, literally flowing from one tense moment to another without pause.  It's definitely an ""edge of your seat"" movie.  There doesn't seem to be one particular good guy in the entire film, everyone is seedy and foul of character.  But when Joey's wife Teresa (Vera Farmiga - 15 Minutes, The Manchurian Candidate) confronts the child molesters, you will raise your hands above you head, clapping and cheering for the white trash woman.Its not so much the shock level or any surprises that make this film so good as it is the tension level.  The director managed to keep a high level of tension throughout the entire movie, which is a rare achievement.  'Running Scared' is a definite nail biter.

Let's see...according to IMDB it was filmed in...yipes!...Newark, New Jersey. Quick...grab your bricks and morter!10 year old (or so) Oleg Yugorsky is a pal of Joey Gazelle's son Nicky. Oleg steals a gun from Joey (a thug...or not?) that was just used in a robbery gone wrong. The movie is a ride through the pursuit of Oleg by Joey through a very cruel world in order to acquire the gun before cops find it first and tie the gun to Joey through forensics.Oleg's scared run takes the viewer to meet his vicious father; through Oleg's hideout in a crack house; into a prostitute's world; into a kidnapping/child molesting couple's lair; into the hands of a bad cop (infamous bad guy character actor Chazz Palminteri); then on to a hockey game from hell. Poor Oleg. How does he keep finding the worst possible situation?Running Scared is kind of like the character tie-ins in Crash meets Frank Miller. The characters, scenes and even the acting are all very graphic novel/comicbook-esque...without the comicbook FX that Sin City had.

""cinemaparker@twitter""","[0, 0]","For starters, if you haven't seen Running Scared, it's a pretty crazy movie loaded with enough violence, depravity and profanity to make your preacher man grab his cross and start praying under his breath. The movie plays out like a twisted version of a kid's fairy tale, something that becomes clear the moment the end credits start playing. The late Paul Walker turns in one of the best performances of his career here, his intensity level keeping up with that of the film's insane pace throughout its running time. There's a whole host of supporting characters here who do great work, especially Vera Farmiga in what is definitely a breakout performance. If you want action and the cinematic equivalent of an adrenaline shot directly to your eyes and brain, Running Scared fits the bill. It's not perfect, mind you and at times laughable (Paul Walker is indeed good in it but at times comes off as if he's trying too hard, admittedly and some of the film's plot trajectory comes off as head scratching at best) but it does what it comes to do quite well, which is give you something hard and brutal to deal with for a good hour and change.The Blu Ray itself is slightly disappointing for a couple of reasons. The picture isn't as sharp as it feels like it SHOULD be but that's no fault of the disc's as the film is highly stylized fare with a very dark and grainy look to it that may come off to the average viewer as imperfect. It shouldn't as this was obviously the director's intention to present it in this fashion. The audio however comes off as somewhat underwhelming. With a film this manic and in your face, I was expecting the audio to follow suit but I just never really felt like it matched the total anarchy on screen. It's a crisp, clear track presented in lossless DTS-HD MA and while it sounds good generally with some good usage of low end frequencies in certain scenes, it's not a particularly active track as far as surround usage goes. This is a film that should have used the surround channels to their fullest and it doesn't quite feel like it ever really does that. Maybe for most, the audio will be fine but for me, I was just expecting something a little more active and engaging. The extras are standard but engaging fare with the director's commentary being particularly interesting.All in all, it's a decent presentation that feels JUST short of the mark I was expecting. I can recommend this to anyone interested but at the very least, it's the best presentation of this film you're likely to get and definitely worth a watch if you have yet to see this film.",4,"Decent Blu Ray for a decent film, one of Paul Walker's best",1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,2590,"['starters', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Running', 'Scared', 'pretty', 'crazy', 'movie', 'loaded', 'enough', 'violence', 'depravity', 'profanity', 'make', 'preacher', 'man', 'grab', 'cross', 'start', 'praying', 'breath', 'movie', 'out', 'twisted', 'version', 'kid', 'fairy', 'tale', 'something', 'clear', 'moment', 'end', 'start', 'playing', 'late', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'here', 'intensity', 'level', 'keeping', 'up', 'film', 'insane', 'pace', 'running', 'time', 'whole', 'host', 'supporting', 'characters', 'here', 'who', 'do', 'great', 'work', 'especially', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'what', 'definitely', 'breakout', 'performance', 'want', 'action', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'adrenaline', 'shot', 'directly', 'eyes', 'brain', 'Running', 'Scared', 'bill', 'not', 'perfect', 'mind', 'times', 'laughable', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'indeed', 'good', 'times', 'off', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'admittedly', 'film', 'plot', 'trajectory', 'off', 'head', 'scratching', 'best', 'what', 'do', 'quite', 'well', 'give', 'something', 'hard', 'brutal', 'deal', 'good', 'hour', 'change.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'couple', 'reasons', 'picture', ""n't"", 'as', 'sharp', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'fault', 'disc', 'film', 'highly', 'stylized', 'fare', 'very', 'dark', 'grainy', 'look', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'average', 'viewer', 'imperfect', 'should', ""n't"", 'was', 'obviously', 'director', 'intention', 'present', 'fashion', 'audio', 'however', 'off', 'somewhat', 'underwhelming', 'film', 'manic', 'face', 'was', 'expecting', 'audio', 'follow', 'suit', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'matched', 'total', 'anarchy', 'screen', 'crisp', 'clear', 'track', 'presented', 'lossless', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', 'good', 'generally', 'good', 'usage', 'low', 'end', 'frequencies', 'certain', 'scenes', 'not', 'particularly', 'active', 'track', 'as', 'far', 'surround', 'usage', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'surround', 'channels', 'fullest', ""n't"", 'quite', 'feel', 'ever', 'really', 'Maybe', 'most', 'audio', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'was', 'just', 'expecting', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'active', 'engaging', 'extras', 'are', 'standard', 'engaging', 'fare', 'director', 'commentary', 'being', 'particularly', 'interesting.All', 'decent', 'presentation', 'JUST', 'short', 'mark', 'was', 'expecting', 'can', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'very', 'least', 'best', 'presentation', 'film', ""'re"", 'likely', 'get', 'definitely', 'watch', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'film']",N/A

Brilliantly directed by Wayne Kramer, it features some of the finest gore, violence, perversion, and sex that I have ever witnessed.Paul Walker delivers a hyperkinetic performance as a low grade mobster who fails to dispose of an incriminating handgun and spends the next 24 hours in a hellish nightmare while trying to recover it. He is joined in this complex journey by a superb supporting cast: Vera Famiga, with her incomparable eyes, an exotic, dynamic, terrific, but too-infrequently-seen actress; Chazz Palminteri, the soul of evil and treachery (at least in this tale); Cameron Bright, one of the few child actors who actually improves a movie; and a host of pimps (reminiscent of Gary Oldman's part in True Romance), good-hearted hookers, thugs, and pedophiles. In a brilliant twist, the only ""normal looking"" two people in this entire ensemble turns out to be (by far) the most twisted and evil of the lot.The occasionally ""artsy"" camera work is actually an asset to the film and does not detract from the flow, as it frequently does in less capable hands. The sex scene (on a running washing machine) literally rises way above the mundane and obligatory purient scenes we have come to expect, as do the shootouts, point blank crotch-blasting, and aggravated assault(s) with a hockey puck. This is a relentlessly original, visually exciting, thrilling-chilling gem of a movie....a ""grim"" fairy tale for fans of the genre. God knows, even the closing credits are exceptional !!!

983482,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000F5WR4W,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[7, 31]","A number of my friends and family will not go to see action films anymore. With the state of the World as it is, they find no entertainment value in watching someone kill or be killed. For me, going to the movies has never been about watching someone get killed, it is about watching an involving story. If it contains violence, does the violence serve the story? If it serves the story, is the story told well? Naturally, many films are mediocre, or just plain bad, and many of these bad films contain violence, but there are also many films made by filmmakers attempting to create art. Basically, these feelings would preclude the same friends and family from ever watching some of Martin Scorcese's best films or the work of Michael Mann. That's unfortunate.However, this same principle will most certainly keep them away from ""Running Scared"", the new film from writer/ director Wayne Kramer (""The Cooler""). The new film is no gem and I am thankful all of my friends and family will be spared over two hours of excessive, over-wrought, poorly acted celluloid. That's very fortunate.When a filmmaker has a success, they are genuinely given a great deal of latitude with their next project. Studios are anxious to work with them, anxious for lightning to strike twice. How often does lightning strike twice? What a shame Kramer spent some of his clout making this film. You would be hard pressed to say the director of ""The Cooler"" also made ""Running Scared"", they are so completely different. And that isn't a compliment.All of the elements of the earlier film's character study have been thrown out the window, completely forsaken in favor of over-produced action sequences and special effects. This is filmmaking in the Tony Scott method; bombard the audience with anything and everything and maybe some of it will stick. If you have ever seen one of Scott's films you will recognize the rapid cuts, paused film, fast forwards and more. For instance, in the first big gun battle (notice, `first'), the camera stops on a guy's hand as he pulls a straight razor from his sock, freezing the action, to make sure the audience notices the new weapon. We then watch, in real time, as it slices the ankle of a gunman. Or if we see someone get a face full of lead, blood and gore splattering behind them, the camera will freeze on the mess and then quickly rewind to show us who shot the bullet and how they got the gun in the first place.Sounds great doesn't it?The overabundance of special effects and POV shots does one thing. Very well. It glorifies the violence. Tony Scott's films use similar techniques (and he could be accused of borrowing from Tarantino, who borrowed from many Hong Kong filmmakers), but Scott's films also manage to invest some of the characters with humanity, no matter how fleeting, making us feel empathy towards them. Kramer is not as successful and no one in ""Running Scared"" does this. From the low level gang members, to the drug runners, to the dirty cops, to the pimps, no one is likable. Worse, no one is interested in anything except saving themselves, making them uninteresting and self-centered. At one point, the neighbor's kid becomes involved and the story veers off into a strange territory, too strange to go into much detail. This sequence seems tacked on to make some of the characters more human, but it really only adds more violence for the sake of violence.Oh and Paul Walker is in the film. With two films released with two weeks, Walker is on the talk show circuit promoting ""Eight Below"", the live action Disney film featuring Walker and a bunch of dogs, the other film. Usually, when an actor has two films released so closely, and they are only promoting one film, it is a good indication of which film they hope will succeed at the box office. ""Eight Below"" is not a great film, but next to ""Running Scared"", it looks like ""Gone With The Wind"". Walker does an okay job with the Jersey accent, but his character, Joey Gazelle, a low rung on the gang's ladder, spends the entire film running frantically from one location to the next, screaming, yelling, cursing to show what a tough guy he is. It's probably just as well Walker chose to promote the film in which he costars with dogs. The other film is simply a dog.The story, such as it is, begins with a drug deal gone bad. Joey (Walker), and the rest of his crew get away, but only after they learn they have killed some dirty cops. His boss tells him to get rid of the guns. Naturally, Joey decides to hide them in his house. Joey's son, and the neighbor's son, who are playing, hide and watch Joey stash them in a secret place. Soon, the neighbor's son shoots his abusive Russian immigrant father and runs away. Joey puts two and two together and has to hunt the gun down before it gets back to the cops. Near the very end of the film, we learn a little secret making the entire film unnecessary, in more ways than one.This is the type of film where every character is a caricature. Chazz Palmienteri appears as Detective Rydell, a crooked cop. The actor seems to have two stock characters he rotates through in his film projects; the crooked cop and the mobster. In ""Running"", he combines both creating a caricature of a caricature. I half expected him to become the animated character Fat Tony from ""The Simpsons"". The abusive Russian Immigrant father? He seems to spend his days sitting around chain smoking while watching ""John Wayne and the Cowboys"" over and over again, always rooting for John Wayne to get up after the climatic gun fight. He so idolizes the Duke, he has a tattoo of the cowboy on his back. I also heard a lot of `dem' and `dose' type of phrases. The film is set in Jersey after all.""Running Scared"" is violent for the sake of violence. Director Kramer wants to show how cool he is, using every filmmaking trick in the book. The violence, gun battles, knives, gunshots, fist fights, etc., are all an excuse for Kramer to show off all of his tricks. What Kramer doesn't seem to realize is that we've all seen these tricks before. In better films. Far better films.I'll make an early prediction here.

The pulsating crime adventure takes place mostly during one long crazy night, and features an array of interesting characters, set in some unusual circumstances, where violence frequently erupts.Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker) is part of the Perello family, an organized crime gang who are surprised during a drug deal, by three masked men with guns, who attempt to rob them.  After a violent shootout, one of the robbers escapes, and it is discovered that the two dead robbers were cops.  Joey's boss Tommy Perello (Johnny Messner) gathers some handguns, and instructs Joey to dispose of the evidence.Gazelle returns to his home in the suburbs, and is observed by his son Nicky (Alex Neuberger), and his friend Oleg (Cameron Bright), hiding the guns in his basement.  While the family is eating dinner, shots ring out, and a bullet narrowly misses Joey's head.  He heads next door and discovers that his neighbor Anzor Yugorsky (Karel Roden) has been shot by his stepson Oleg, who has vanished with a distinctive chrome handgun that Gazelle recognizes as his boss's piece.Joey realizes that if he doesn't recover Perello's gun, he is a dead man, and his quest to find Oleg and recover the gun, is a frantic and suspenseful adventure that eventually involves his son Nicky, and his wife Teresa (Vera Farminga).  Facing various crises, their activities generate ripples that eventually come crashing back.  Matters are further complicated by the actions of Rydell (Chazz Palminteri) the crooked cop who escaped the initial robbery attempt, and Russian mob boss Ivan Yugorski (John Noble), who is working a deal with the Perello family.The storyline is unpredictable, often electric with tension, and takes place at locations spread across the state of New York, during one very eventful night.  The characters generally seem real, and the acting mostly believable, with some very strong performances all around, particularly Cameron Bright, Vera Farminga, and Paul Walker.  The chances are that most will be drawn into the movie, and develop strong feelings about the main characters, as lots of crazy things happen along the way.Running Scared just keeps the hits coming, but near the end, things do go start to go too far.  There is an extremely overdramatic scene set in a hockey rink, where both profanity and violence explode.  Taking several hockey puck hits to the head, Joey should have his face broken, and be minus at least one eye, but he somehow manages to survive a vicious shootout.  Just when you think you can relax, another crisis occurs, as the missing gun unexpectedly turns up.  This is followed by an explosive fatality, and even more drama as Gazelle races to get home before he bleeds out.The film's ""twist"" ending, is a huge disappointment, featuring a development that obliterates the credibility of most of what occurred up to that point.  After jerking the rug out from underneath, the movie sells out completely, never really offering an explanation for what is an absurd situation, one where the circumstances apparently absolves all those involved of any guilt for their crimes, including murder.After the great things that preceded it, the ""storybook"" finish provides grounds to question the judgment of big studios.  It you are going to make a gritty, violent, brutal, stylish thriller, have the balls to see it through to a fitting end, and not cop out like some sappy TV movie.  Running Scared is definitely worth seeing, but the title seems to apply more to the filmmakers, than the characters in the movie.",4,"a gripping, fast-paced, nocturnal journey through the seedy underbelly of new york, that ends far too sweetly...",1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,3783,"['end', 'whole', 'premise', 'Running', 'Scared', '2007', 'may', 'crumble', 'pile', 'too', 'convenient', 'fluff', 'way', 'movie', 'take', 'unpredictable', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'wild', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'turns', 'unexpected', 'thrills', 'pulsating', 'crime', 'adventure', 'place', 'mostly', 'one', 'long', 'crazy', 'night', 'array', 'interesting', 'characters', 'set', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'where', 'violence', 'frequently', 'Gazelle', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'part', 'Perello', 'family', 'organized', 'crime', 'gang', 'who', 'are', 'surprised', 'drug', 'deal', 'three', 'masked', 'men', 'guns', 'who', 'attempt', 'rob', 'violent', 'shootout', 'one', 'robbers', 'escapes', 'discovered', 'two', 'dead', 'robbers', 'were', 'cops', 'Joey', 'boss', 'Tommy', 'Perello', 'Johnny', 'Messner', 'handguns', 'instructs', 'Joey', 'dispose', 'evidence.Gazelle', 'returns', 'home', 'suburbs', 'observed', 'son', 'Nicky', 'Alex', 'Neuberger', 'friend', 'Oleg', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'hiding', 'guns', 'basement', 'family', 'eating', 'dinner', 'shots', 'ring', 'out', 'bullet', 'narrowly', 'Joey', 'head', 'next', 'door', 'discovers', 'neighbor', 'Anzor', 'Yugorsky', 'Karel', 'Roden', 'been', 'shot', 'stepson', 'Oleg', 'who', 'vanished', 'distinctive', 'chrome', 'handgun', 'Gazelle', 'boss', 'piece.Joey', ""n't"", 'recover', 'Perello', 'gun', 'dead', 'man', 'quest', 'find', 'Oleg', 'recover', 'gun', 'frantic', 'suspenseful', 'adventure', 'eventually', 'son', 'Nicky', 'wife', 'Teresa', 'Vera', 'Farminga', 'Facing', 'various', 'crises', 'activities', 'generate', 'ripples', 'eventually', 'come', 'crashing', 'back', 'Matters', 'are', 'further', 'complicated', 'actions', 'Rydell', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'crooked', 'cop', 'who', 'escaped', 'initial', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'Russian', 'mob', 'boss', 'Ivan', 'Yugorski', 'John', 'Noble', 'who', 'working', 'deal', 'Perello', 'family.The', 'storyline', 'unpredictable', 'often', 'electric', 'tension', 'place', 'locations', 'spread', 'state', 'New', 'York', 'one', 'very', 'eventful', 'night', 'characters', 'generally', 'seem', 'real', 'acting', 'mostly', 'believable', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'around', 'particularly', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'Vera', 'Farminga', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'chances', 'are', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'movie', 'develop', 'strong', 'feelings', 'main', 'characters', 'lots', 'crazy', 'things', 'happen', 'way.Running', 'Scared', 'just', 'hits', 'coming', 'end', 'things', 'do', 'go', 'start', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'extremely', 'overdramatic', 'scene', 'set', 'hockey', 'rink', 'where', 'profanity', 'violence', 'explode', 'Taking', 'several', 'hockey', 'puck', 'hits', 'head', 'Joey', 'should', 'have', 'face', 'broken', 'be', 'minus', 'least', 'one', 'eye', 'somehow', 'survive', 'vicious', 'shootout', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'can', 'relax', 'crisis', 'occurs', 'missing', 'gun', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'followed', 'explosive', 'fatality', 'even', 'more', 'drama', 'Gazelle', 'get', 'home', 'out.The', 'film', 'twist', 'ending', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'featuring', 'development', 'credibility', 'most', 'what', 'occurred', 'up', 'point', 'jerking', 'rug', 'underneath', 'movie', 'out', 'completely', 'never', 'really', 'offering', 'explanation', 'what', 'absurd', 'situation', 'one', 'where', 'circumstances', 'apparently', 'involved', 'guilt', 'crimes', 'including', 'murder.After', 'great', 'things', 'preceded', 'storybook', 'finish', 'grounds', 'question', 'judgment', 'big', 'studios', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'gritty', 'violent', 'brutal', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'have', 'balls', 'see', 'fitting', 'end', 'not', 'cop', 'out', 'sappy', 'TV', 'movie', 'Running', 'Scared', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'title', 'apply', 'more', 'filmmakers', 'characters', 'movie']",N/A
