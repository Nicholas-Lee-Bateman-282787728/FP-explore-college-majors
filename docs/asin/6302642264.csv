I've seen more emotion from the animals than any other animal movie. This is a MUST for all who want a good message at the end.After a shipwreck, Benji survives and is stranded in the wilderness trying to figure out how to get out of the bind he's in. He quickly changes goals and plays ""mother"" when he discovers young orphaned Cougar Cubs when he finds out that a hunter shot and killed the mother. Benji has a few oppurtunities to go back home to his master but he sacrifices his life and time to try to persuade another mother Cougar to adopt the cubs. During his adventurous goals, he discovers a Wolf is after the cubs for a quick and easy meal. Benji tries to steer the Wolf away from the cubs putting his own life on the line. To add, the music is powerful and emotional that fits perfectly with the story.I just recieved the DVD through Amazon, and I have mixed reveiws. Although seeing the movie once again does go above what I consider ""the little negative things"" about this DVD, I was still  a little bummed that the DVD only has the 'full-screen' edition and the quality of a VHS. Other than that, I'm just glad that Amazon has finally released this movie! :) I will gladly own this until they at least release this in 'wide-screen'.",5,My All Time Favorite Benji Movie!!! :),1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,1353,"['be', 'favorite', 'Benji', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'extreme', 'amounts', 'emotion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'emotion', 'animals', 'other', 'animal', 'movie', 'MUST', 'who', 'want', 'good', 'message', 'end.After', 'shipwreck', 'Benji', 'survives', 'stranded', 'wilderness', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'bind', 'quickly', 'goals', 'mother', 'when', 'young', 'orphaned', 'Cougar', 'Cubs', 'when', 'out', 'hunter', 'shot', 'killed', 'mother', 'Benji', 'few', 'oppurtunities', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'master', 'life', 'time', 'try', 'persuade', 'mother', 'Cougar', 'adopt', 'cubs', 'adventurous', 'goals', 'Wolf', 'cubs', 'quick', 'easy', 'meal', 'Benji', 'steer', 'Wolf', 'away', 'cubs', 'putting', 'own', 'life', 'line', 'add', 'music', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'perfectly', 'story.I', 'just', 'recieved', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'have', 'mixed', 'reveiws', 'seeing', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'go', 'what', 'consider', 'little', 'negative', 'things', 'DVD', 'was', 'still', 'little', 'bummed', 'DVD', 'only', ""'full-screen"", 'edition', 'quality', 'VHS', 'Other', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'Amazon', 'finally', 'released', 'movie', 'will', 'gladly', 'own', 'least', 'release', ""'wide-screen""]",N/A

Dawson,"[0, 0]","This is a great movie for children.(especially if they love dogs) Sure it's pretty far-fetched in places, sure it seems cheesy at times but they won't even notice. The little dog that plays Benji in this movie (Her name is Benjean) is one of the cutest dogs you will ever come across in a movie. I watched this movie over and over as a child on an old beat up video tape that my grandmother recorded off of network tv! Haha.I picked up the DVD to keep for my kids or friends kids to watch as well. Whenever it is on I still find myself laughing at the little cubs and the way Benjean interacts with them. The scene where she first hears them, and she SLOWLY peaks around the corner of a rock to see what is making the noise, she takes on an almost human quality. I can only imagine the time and effort it must have taken to tape and retape this movie and the training the little dog must have received to be able to convey her expressions and do some of the things she does in the film.If you are looking for a unique movie for the kids to enjoy, I highly recommend picking this up for a few dollars.

325079,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,6302642264,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 4]","If you're a fan of Siskel & Ebert, then you'll know why this movie is rather infamous. Back in 1987, Ebert gave Full Metal Jacket a thumbs down while he gave Benji The Hunted a thumbs up. It became a rather heated debate on the show, and people still remember the argument between the two critics. I agree with Siskel that Full Metal Jacket is a great war film (it's in fact one of my favorite films of all time). But at the same time, I do agree with Ebert that Benji the Hunted is a film that's tailored specifically for kids. This is not a movie for adults, and it shows. As an adult, I find this movie to be a bit silly and tedious. A little dog that must survive in the wilderness isn't really one that would interest grownups. I will say, however, that there are some nice shots of forests and mountains. There are a few tender moments in the film, but these kinds of moments are for little children, of course. In the end, Benji The Hunted is a kids film that may or may not be very enticing for adults (except those who grew up watching this). Children will probably like it, but adults will certainly find it pretty dull and uninteresting.Grade: C",3,"Pretty silly and tedious, but it IS a kids film",1274486400,"05 22, 2010",2010,1156,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'then', ""'ll"", 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'rather', 'infamous', 'Back', '1987', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'thumbs', 'down', 'gave', 'Benji', 'Hunted', 'thumbs', 'up', 'became', 'rather', 'heated', 'debate', 'show', 'people', 'still', 'remember', 'argument', 'two', 'critics', 'agree', 'Siskel', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'great', 'war', 'film', 'fact', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'same', 'time', 'do', 'agree', 'Ebert', 'Benji', 'Hunted', 'film', 'tailored', 'specifically', 'kids', 'not', 'movie', 'adults', 'adult', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'bit', 'silly', 'tedious', 'little', 'dog', 'must', 'survive', 'wilderness', ""n't"", 'really', 'one', 'would', 'interest', 'grownups', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'are', 'nice', 'shots', 'forests', 'mountains', 'are', 'few', 'tender', 'moments', 'film', 'kinds', 'moments', 'are', 'little', 'children', 'course', 'end', 'Benji', 'Hunted', 'kids', 'film', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'enticing', 'adults', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Children', 'will', 'probably', 'adults', 'will', 'certainly', 'find', 'pretty', 'dull', 'uninteresting.Grade', 'C']",N/A
