1654305,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B00D8MWW26,Addicted2Amazon!,"[0, 0]","We were looking for an entertaining horror movie to pass the time and came across this one at our supermarket.  Being a huge fan of horror films in general, I remembered that I had come across it previously here on Amazon.  The reviews had started out badly but eventually there were some defenders, so I thought, hey, for under $2.00, sure!I actually did enjoy this film.  I'm female and thought the lead actor was very cute!  :-)  Ha, but seriously...This is a pretty low budget one, yes.  No Ghosthouse Pictures/Lionsgate, no.  The plot, concerning a man and his girlfriend that purposely move into a supposedly haunted house and try to communicate with the spirits, was entertaining.  The film definitely has it's jump moments.  I have seen many, many horror films, and let me tell you, this movie actually had one of the BEST jump moments I have seen in a horror movie since the cabinet scene in ""Paranormal Activity 2""!!  It definitely ""Got Me""!  I totally didn't even see that coming!But yes, there is a sheeted ghost, which I thought was extinct in film since the 1950s. When that part happened, it was actually creepy at first but then turned...funny!  Unintentionally I guess, but, heck, I was laughing, beer in hand, entertained the entire time!  So, I guess it depends on what you're looking for.  :-)So do you need to see this movie?  No.  Is it great?  No.  Did I enjoy watching it?  Yes!  I have to be truthful!  I liked it!  But you probably should just pass on it.  IF you are set on seeing it, there is only one place that I can recommend getting it:  your local supermarket Redbox.  Yep. Buck ninety-nine.

It's based on a rather tired premise (young broke couple need to live in a place that hasn't rented because of its reputation). It's not, strictly speaking, a &#34;found footage&#34; film, but it has many of the attributes: shaky camera work, odd non sequiturs, a feeling of inadequate scripting...The acting was passable, but with more than one wooden moment: the &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34; was elusive. Liesel Kopp, as &#34;Stella&#34;, the girl-friend was inordinately weak in a role that cried out for more depth and complexity. Her performance was more indicative of directorial inexperience than any lack of talent. This was exacerbated by a script that needed some professional editing.&#34;:Special&#34; effects, such as they were, were inadequate, and suggested a budget that was barely capable of covering the cost of equipment rental. The &#34;ghost&#34; effects were clich&eacute; (how many times since &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; do we have to see kitchen cupboards exploding open?) - and, I'm sorry, but a ghost that does its haunting covered by a bedsheet is simply below the level necessary to carry any weight. Unfortunately, the &#34;ghost&#34; played by Shane Cole (presumably a close relative of the director's), managed, despite a complete absence of dialogue, to seem bombastic and over-acted.All that said, though, I have to commend Derek Cole on a good effort. It's more than I managed at that age, and the overall technical quality is moving in the right direction - albeit with a long way still to go.",3,"""E"" for Effort, Now Back to Film School.",1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,1638,"['have', 'confess', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'enjoy', 'more', 'based', 'rather', 'tired', 'premise', 'young', 'broke', 'couple', 'need', 'live', 'place', ""n't"", 'rented', 'reputation', 'not', 'strictly', 'speaking', '34', 'found', 'footage', '34', 'film', 'many', 'attributes', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'odd', 'non', 'sequiturs', 'feeling', 'inadequate', 'scripting', 'acting', 'was', 'passable', 'more', 'one', 'wooden', 'moment', '34', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', '34', 'was', 'elusive', 'Liesel', 'Kopp', '34', 'Stella', '34', 'girl-friend', 'was', 'inordinately', 'weak', 'role', 'cried', 'out', 'more', 'depth', 'complexity', 'performance', 'was', 'more', 'indicative', 'directorial', 'inexperience', 'lack', 'talent', 'was', 'exacerbated', 'script', 'needed', 'professional', 'editing.', '34', 'Special', '34', 'effects', 'such', 'were', 'were', 'inadequate', 'suggested', 'budget', 'was', 'barely', 'capable', 'covering', 'cost', 'equipment', 'rental', '34', 'ghost', '34', 'effects', 'were', 'clich', 'eacute', 'how', 'many', 'times', '34', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '34', 'do', 'have', 'see', 'kitchen', 'cupboards', 'exploding', 'open', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'ghost', 'haunting', 'covered', 'bedsheet', 'simply', 'level', 'necessary', 'carry', 'weight', 'Unfortunately', '34', 'ghost', '34', 'played', 'Shane', 'Cole', 'presumably', 'close', 'relative', 'director', 'managed', 'complete', 'absence', 'dialogue', 'seem', 'bombastic', 'over-acted.All', 'said', 'have', 'commend', 'Derek', 'Cole', 'good', 'effort', 'more', 'managed', 'age', 'overall', 'technical', 'quality', 'moving', 'right', 'direction', 'albeit', 'long', 'way', 'still', 'go']",An American Ghost Story

Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it.  The actors were not the greatest, but you rarely find truly great actors in the genre.  They were adequate.  The story was built slowly and leaned to.  Things happened over a three month period and developed much like the former tenant described.  Much of the time the scare would come after the disturbing part was over.  Example after the main character is following children's voices around the house.  He gets an email from his bud with the stupid jump scare that everyone has gotten in there own email.  There are complaints about bedsheets ghosts, but they were done effectively and were rather cool.  The only real annoyance was the ending of the ending.

1654313,A391AS877NJKUB,B00D8MWW26,"G. Smith ""Egghead""","[1, 4]","My review in a sentence: worth watching.It is clear to me that the crew who worked on this movie are fans of classic, straightforward, haunted house flicks.  The story has all of the foundations that make it familiar - family is slaughtered, leaving their spirits behind to torment the main character(s) after they move into the house.  In keeping with horrors gothic roots, the characters are archetypes, but with enough idiosyncrasies that allow them to stand out and make this a unique story.  The cinematography and music really add to a tense, eerie atmosphere that, unlike much of today's big-budget horror films, actually feels haunted.  The pacing is appropriate for its intended audience.  An American Ghost Story doesn't pander to the SAW crowd, and those with short attention spans will be turned off by the film's slow burn.  For those of us who grew up reading ghost stories, however, this film will feel just right and when those moments of fright kicked in, you'll feel like you really earned them.Although you can likely guess exactly how the story will play out, I'll make one comment that I feel should be tagged as a spoiler:*****SPOILER*****I am full of elephants.  No, just kidding.  What I meant to say is that there is no mystery in this movie, and that comes with a sigh of relief.  No character spends any time following the bread crumbs of lonely specters, as Paul rents the house knowing full well that if he sees ghosts, they're of the murdered family.  It's one thing to have a neat mystery from time to time, but that's one cliche horror could easily use less.  If I were to guess, supernatural mysteries are going to be more common with female protagonists, especially ones that remain true to their intuitions despite being blocked by domineering, untrusting males (usually, a husband and/or a doctor).  That archetype would make for an interesting psychology or gender studies research paper, and maybe some day I'll actually do that myself.  Anyways, this has been a bit of rambling to further obscure the unnecessarily tagged spoiler that probably doesn't ruin the movie at all.*****End of SPIOLER*****While I like the movie a lot, I knock off two stars.  One star gets bagged and tossed in the river because the dialog is very poorly written.  Characters will have either unexplained knowledge (or the lack of it), and they make leaps in logic that no clear-thinking person would make.  The second star gets drawn and quartered because the movie clearly shows one of the characters having a strong connection with the house, but leaving the details of that relationship to the imagination of the viewer.  When we see something on the screen, it is the director who puts it there, and if they don't make use of that, it's a waste of time.  Imagine that a character walks on set, and the camera zooms into his shifty eyes, then zooms out to follow the character back off-set.  I don't know about you, but I'm not just left with questions, but a bright, shining 'WTF?!' floating above my head.  WTF-halos annoy me, so star #2 pays the ultimate price.All in all, this really is a good movie.  It's indie, and money equalling time, you have to give it allowances for the acting not being perfect.  Esthetically, it's very pleasing.  Technically, it's an achievement worth being proud of.  And honestly, it's a good, classic horror movie.  Unfortunately, it's also got some personality issues that prevent this good film from being really great.",3,"Decently tense, no nonsense horror.",1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,3475,"['review', 'sentence', 'worth', 'watching.It', 'clear', 'crew', 'who', 'worked', 'movie', 'are', 'fans', 'classic', 'straightforward', 'haunted', 'house', 'flicks', 'story', 'foundations', 'make', 'familiar', 'family', 'slaughtered', 'leaving', 'spirits', 'torment', 'main', 'character', 's', 'move', 'house', 'keeping', 'horrors', 'gothic', 'roots', 'characters', 'are', 'archetypes', 'enough', 'idiosyncrasies', 'allow', 'stand', 'out', 'make', 'unique', 'story', 'cinematography', 'music', 'really', 'add', 'tense', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'much', 'today', 'big-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'actually', 'feels', 'haunted', 'pacing', 'appropriate', 'intended', 'audience', 'American', 'Ghost', 'Story', ""n't"", 'pander', 'SAW', 'crowd', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'slow', 'burn', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'ghost', 'stories', 'however', 'film', 'will', 'feel', 'just', 'right', 'when', 'moments', 'fright', 'kicked', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'really', 'earned', 'can', 'likely', 'guess', 'exactly', 'how', 'story', 'will', 'play', 'out', ""'ll"", 'make', 'one', 'comment', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'tagged', 'spoiler', '*****SPOILER*****I', 'am', 'full', 'elephants', 'No', 'just', 'kidding', 'What', 'meant', 'say', 'mystery', 'movie', 'sigh', 'relief', 'character', 'time', 'following', 'bread', 'crumbs', 'lonely', 'specters', 'Paul', 'house', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'ghosts', ""'re"", 'murdered', 'family', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'neat', 'mystery', 'time', 'time', 'one', 'cliche', 'horror', 'could', 'easily', 'use', 'less', 'were', 'guess', 'supernatural', 'mysteries', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'common', 'female', 'protagonists', 'especially', 'ones', 'remain', 'true', 'intuitions', 'being', 'blocked', 'domineering', 'untrusting', 'males', 'usually', 'husband', 'doctor', 'archetype', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'psychology', 'gender', 'studies', 'research', 'paper', 'maybe', 'day', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'do', 'Anyways', 'been', 'bit', 'rambling', 'further', 'obscure', 'unnecessarily', 'tagged', 'spoiler', 'probably', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', '*****End', 'SPIOLER*****While', 'like', 'movie', 'lot', 'knock', 'off', 'two', 'stars', 'One', 'star', 'bagged', 'tossed', 'river', 'dialog', 'very', 'poorly', 'written', 'Characters', 'will', 'have', 'unexplained', 'knowledge', 'lack', 'make', 'leaps', 'logic', 'clear-thinking', 'person', 'would', 'make', 'second', 'star', 'drawn', 'quartered', 'movie', 'clearly', 'one', 'characters', 'having', 'strong', 'connection', 'house', 'leaving', 'details', 'relationship', 'imagination', 'viewer', 'When', 'see', 'something', 'screen', 'director', 'who', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'use', 'waste', 'time', 'Imagine', 'character', 'walks', 'set', 'camera', 'shifty', 'eyes', 'then', 'out', 'follow', 'character', 'back', 'off-set', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'left', 'questions', 'bright', 'shining', 'floating', 'head', 'WTF-halos', 'so', 'star', '2', 'ultimate', 'price.All', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'indie', 'money', 'equalling', 'time', 'have', 'give', 'acting', 'not', 'being', 'perfect', 'Esthetically', 'very', 'pleasing', 'Technically', 'achievement', 'worth', 'being', 'proud', 'honestly', 'good', 'classic', 'horror', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'got', 'personality', 'issues', 'prevent', 'good', 'film', 'being', 'really', 'great']",An American Ghost Story

If that sounds like the set-up for Sinister all I can say is that before too long you will wish this movie was a rip-off of Sinister--at least then there would be a plot and stuff would actually happen.The woman flees the house after an amusing encounter where she backs out of the kitchen slowly, trying to look terrified as cabinets open around her.  Well, it's a haunted house--what did she think was going to happen?The problem is that this leaves her boyfriend in the house alone waiting for something scary to happen.  Occasionally a title appears on-screen to remind us of how long he's been in the house with absolutely nothing happening.  The lead actor has a face for radio and no acting ability whatsoever but he also wrote the screenplay, which I guess explains how he got the part.Eventually the filmmakers decided the boredom had to end so all hell breaks loose, more or less.  The one good effect the filmmakers came up with was a ghost rising from the sheets on the bed beside the hero when he wasn't looking and didn't notice.  The ""terrifying"" finale involves the ghost in the sheet chasing the hero around the house.  The problem is that the effect doesn't work--when the ghost is running around it becomes really, really obvious that it's actually someone under a sheet and it looks completely ridiculous.It's hard to believe that it didn't occur to writer/star Stephen Twardokus to include any plot whatsoever--there's no attempt to figure out exactly who the ghost is or what it wants, if anything.  A family was murdered in the house--supposedly a murder suicide where the father killed his family then himself.  Is the father the ghost?  The kid?  Are there multiple ghosts?  Is it possible that the father didn't kill his family after all and it was really the shifty landlord who doesn't want to set foot inside the house?None of this occurs to the hero who wants to write a book about the house but seems to have no curiosity whatsoever about what might be happening in it.An American Ghost Story is boring and pathetically dull except for the couple of scenes that are unintentionally amusing. Avoid even if you like bad horror movies because this isn't a fun bad horror movie--it's too slow and lazy to feel like anything other than a vanity project that never should have seen the light of day.",1,Stunningly awful,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,2684,"['Stunningly', 'dull', 'thoroughly', 'awful', 'attempt', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'film', 'camcorder', 'gimmick', 'few', 'minutes', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movie', 'offers', 'competent', 'acting', 'special', 'effects.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'move', 'supposedly', 'haunted', 'house', 'man', 'write', 'book', 'set-up', 'Sinister', 'can', 'say', 'before', 'too', 'long', 'will', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'rip-off', 'Sinister', 'least', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'stuff', 'would', 'actually', 'happen.The', 'woman', 'house', 'amusing', 'encounter', 'where', 'kitchen', 'slowly', 'trying', 'look', 'terrified', 'cabinets', 'open', 'Well', 'haunted', 'house', 'what', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'problem', 'boyfriend', 'house', 'alone', 'waiting', 'something', 'scary', 'happen', 'Occasionally', 'title', 'on-screen', 'remind', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'house', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'happening', 'lead', 'actor', 'face', 'radio', 'acting', 'ability', 'whatsoever', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'guess', 'how', 'got', 'part.Eventually', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'boredom', 'had', 'end', 'so', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'more', 'less', 'one', 'good', 'effect', 'filmmakers', 'came', 'up', 'was', 'ghost', 'rising', 'sheets', 'bed', 'hero', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'terrifying', 'finale', 'ghost', 'sheet', 'chasing', 'hero', 'house', 'problem', 'effect', ""n't"", 'work', 'when', 'ghost', 'running', 'really', 'really', 'obvious', 'actually', 'someone', 'sheet', 'completely', 'ridiculous.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'writer/star', 'Stephen', 'Twardokus', 'include', 'plot', 'whatsoever', 'attempt', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'who', 'ghost', 'what', 'anything', 'family', 'was', 'murdered', 'house', 'supposedly', 'murder', 'suicide', 'where', 'father', 'killed', 'family', 'then', 'father', 'ghost', 'kid', 'Are', 'there', 'multiple', 'ghosts', 'possible', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'family', 'was', 'really', 'shifty', 'landlord', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'set', 'foot', 'house', 'None', 'hero', 'who', 'write', 'book', 'house', 'have', 'curiosity', 'whatsoever', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'happening', 'it.An', 'American', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'boring', 'pathetically', 'dull', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'unintentionally', 'amusing', 'Avoid', 'even', 'like', 'bad', 'horror', 'movies', ""n't"", 'fun', 'bad', 'horror', 'movie', 'too', 'slow', 'lazy', 'feel', 'anything', 'other', 'vanity', 'project', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'light', 'day']",An American Ghost Story

The camera work is professional and imaginative, the script tight with interesting characters, and the acting convincing. This modern suburban home looks so conventional and boring, but lighting, camera angles, sound and great emoting by writer/star Stephen Twardokus, Wendy Haines and Liesel Kopp make you want to see what happens next in each scene.Director Derek Cole makes Mr. Twardokus' script really convince you this house might be genuinely haunted using some spare but quite effective special effects. The tone is kept consistent and the main characters are likable without being cloying. The low budget was actually probably a virtue because what the director and writer have come up with is as frightening as the no budget Night of the Living Dead was to it's first audiences back in 1968.For a ghost story to work you have to believe two things:1)the main character is worth caring about, and 2)she or he is really being attacked by a supernatural entity. Twardokus makes you believe this quirky guy is driven to such an obsession he would stay in this hellish place despite it's obvious danger towards the end. Director Cole makes you believe those cabinets, chairs, and sheet really are possessed by something very real and very dangerous.I was so delighted by the ingenuity of the filmmakers I leant my copy to a co-worker the next day.

1654324,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00D8MWW26,Matthew Scott Baker,"[1, 2]","I must preface my review with a statement:  AN AMERICAN GHOST STORY is not what I was expecting, and that is certainly a good thing.  After the first 10 minutes, I was expecting to hate it...the acting is not that great and the story sounded very generic.  BUT...I am sooooo glad that I finished it because this film is actually a top notch ghost story that made me jump on several occasions.  It is not a big budget picture, so the acting can be overlooked; but where it lacks in budget, it makes up for with innovative style and excellent scares.I read several negative reviews about this film after I watched it, and I can see where some of those reviewers were coming from.  The actors are not of the highest caliber and the story is a bit slow in some parts.  But if you can overlook both of those, you&#8217;re in for a real treat here.AN AMERICAN GHOST STORY is shot well for a low-budget feature and has some nifty camerawork throughout.  Surprisingly, there is no gore in this film at all, however the rest of the special effects (specifically, the &#8216;ghost&#8217; scenes) are well done and very creative.  Whereas some films use CG or even regular animation to show the ghosts, director Derek Cole bends the genre mold a bit and decides not to show them...technically (you just have to watch the film to understand).  This, in turn, creates an even more haunting atmosphere in which to scare the audience.And the scares are nice!  There&#8217;s a lot of tension built into the story and the character of Paul does a great job of fleshing it out.  His obsessive quest to interact with the spirits ultimately leads to bad things, which we get to see and enjoy.  The buildup is a bit slow at times, but once things start going, they don&#8217;t really stop.Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t give AN AMERICAN GHOST STORY a perfect rating.  The acting in some aspects really is downright terrible.  I hate to point fingers at individuals, but Liesel Kopp does not do a good job in her role.  I feel like she spends more time trying to avoid eye-contact with the camera and less time acting.But that is a mild downside for such an effective horror flick.  Look past the rough exterior and see the gem that lies within AN AMERICAN GHOST STORY.  I recommend giving this one a shot.

Paul (Stephen Twardokus) and Stella (Liesel Kopp) move into a haunted house so Paul can write a book on it. Turns out the house is haunted, Stella moves out. Paul does not and investigates further.This is a plain and simple low budget ghost story. It was well scripted and directed. Stephen Twardokus who wrote and produced the film was weakest as an actor. They should of had someone else in that role. The story line is simple without any twists. The intent of the film is to scare, i.e. make you jump. It tries to this a dozen or so times, and actually made me jump once, something I don't normally do in the daylight and sober. Don't expect a great horror tale, just a good ghost movie for the sleep over.What we know about the ghost: It can throw a basketball, but can't hit the rim. It can stack chairs, but can't decorate. It can turn on a radio, but has trouble changing stations. And it must be a male because it leaves the draws open.Making its way around Redbox in 2014.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

1654334,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B00D8MWW26,The Peripatetic Reader,"[0, 1]","For all its perceived weaknesses, An American Ghost Story succeeds where scores of other horror films  --  armed with computer-generated graphics, special effects and blood and gore  -- have failed: Namely, to produce a bona fide, spine-tingling, and scary movie.An American Ghost Story has achieved this rare feat by skillfully employing film-noir techniques of light and shadow, a minimum of spoken dialogue that forces the viewer to follow the action in the movie, and elements of tricking the movie viewer.The movie involves the story of a newspaper writer who rents a house where the grisly murder of a family occurred. The writer, the main character of the film, seeks to investigate rumors of the house being haunted and recording his experiences in a book. His girlfriend abandoned him early in the film, and despite small experiences of the ghosts, doggedly stays in the house until ""sometime big"" happens. That big climax indeed happens, with surprising results.The producers of the film accomplish this genuine thriller with the simple technique of using sheets, furtive movements, and genuine suspense. Sheets for ghosts? You may say in this age of computer animation this might appear retro or rather lame. But as applied in this movie, you will be surprised how amazingly effective it is at scaring the wits out of you. It is cinematic equivalent of someone jumping out from the bushes and saying ""Boo!""This is a perfect horror film. It is a small production, there is no blood and gore. Aside from the family who was killed before the action in this movie, no one else is murdered or slaughtered. There are no special computer graphics which end up looking phoney anyway.  Here, less is better, and it works very effectively.",5,A Genuine Thriller.,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,1740,"['perceived', 'weaknesses', 'American', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'where', 'scores', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'armed', 'computer-generated', 'graphics', 'special', 'effects', 'blood', 'gore', 'have', 'failed', 'Namely', 'produce', 'bona', 'fide', 'spine-tingling', 'scary', 'movie.An', 'American', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'achieved', 'rare', 'feat', 'skillfully', 'employing', 'film-noir', 'techniques', 'light', 'shadow', 'minimum', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'viewer', 'follow', 'action', 'movie', 'elements', 'tricking', 'movie', 'viewer.The', 'movie', 'story', 'newspaper', 'writer', 'who', 'house', 'where', 'grisly', 'murder', 'family', 'occurred', 'writer', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'investigate', 'rumors', 'house', 'being', 'haunted', 'recording', 'experiences', 'book', 'girlfriend', 'abandoned', 'early', 'film', 'small', 'experiences', 'ghosts', 'doggedly', 'house', 'sometime', 'big', 'big', 'climax', 'indeed', 'surprising', 'results.The', 'producers', 'film', 'accomplish', 'genuine', 'thriller', 'simple', 'technique', 'using', 'sheets', 'furtive', 'movements', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'Sheets', 'ghosts', 'may', 'say', 'age', 'computer', 'animation', 'might', 'appear', 'retro', 'rather', 'lame', 'applied', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'amazingly', 'effective', 'scaring', 'wits', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'someone', 'jumping', 'out', 'bushes', 'saying', 'Boo', 'perfect', 'horror', 'film', 'small', 'production', 'blood', 'gore', 'Aside', 'family', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'action', 'movie', 'one', 'else', 'murdered', 'slaughtered', 'are', 'special', 'computer', 'graphics', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'phoney', 'anyway', 'Here', 'less', 'better', 'very', 'effectively']",An American Ghost Story

The acting was good and the use of noise on the sound tract had made for some unnerving moments. It brought back memories of myself, covering my eyes with my hand to block my sight from what was surely to follow in the next second or two on the screen.  That was when I was a teenager... except new memories were made since the same action was applied tonight when watching this film. There was suspense all right.  To me the only draw back was the lead actor.  He acted much too average for the average ""Joe"" in the movie who was the main character in the film. I can understand why some of the audience didn't really take to him.  He seemed a little insipid.  Sorry.  That was the only flaw to the film I picked up on.If you are into slash and gash this is not the movie for you.  The director created a wonderful dark atmosphere for a traditional ghost story without the old melodrama routine.  The movie was true to form about hauntings and it was very realistic.For all of you thinking this form of a haunting is too tame, it may seem tame if you are not experiencing it first hand.  But, that is the way the story usually reads.  Noise, bumps in the night, or perhaps a attempted communication and a glimpse out of the corner of your eye.  In this movie, he didn't just get a glimpse.  He got a good look at what makes a negative entity really tick.Happy Halloween folks!",3,The American Ghost Story,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,1448,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'above', 'average', 'genre', 'spook', 'movies', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'use', 'noise', 'sound', 'tract', 'had', 'made', 'unnerving', 'moments', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'covering', 'eyes', 'hand', 'block', 'sight', 'what', 'was', 'surely', 'follow', 'next', 'second', 'two', 'screen', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'new', 'memories', 'were', 'made', 'same', 'action', 'was', 'applied', 'tonight', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'suspense', 'right', 'only', 'draw', 'back', 'was', 'lead', 'actor', 'acted', 'much', 'too', 'average', 'average', 'Joe', 'movie', 'who', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'seemed', 'little', 'insipid', 'Sorry', 'was', 'only', 'flaw', 'film', 'picked', 'up', 'are', 'slash', 'gash', 'not', 'movie', 'director', 'created', 'wonderful', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'traditional', 'ghost', 'story', 'old', 'melodrama', 'routine', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'form', 'hauntings', 'was', 'very', 'realistic.For', 'thinking', 'form', 'haunting', 'too', 'tame', 'may', 'seem', 'tame', 'are', 'not', 'experiencing', 'first', 'hand', 'way', 'story', 'usually', 'Noise', 'bumps', 'night', 'perhaps', 'attempted', 'communication', 'glimpse', 'corner', 'eye', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'glimpse', 'got', 'good', 'look', 'what', 'negative', 'entity', 'really', 'tick.Happy', 'Halloween', 'folks']",An American Ghost Story
