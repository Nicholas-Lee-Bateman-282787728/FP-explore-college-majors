745788,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B00008NV4G,andy8047,"[3, 6]","NBC's hit sitcom Cheers was seen Thursday evenings just like The Cosby Show. It premiered on September 30,1982,immediately bringing CBS's Archie Bunker's Place's ratings down. Eight days earlier,NBC launched Family Ties. At the time of Cheers' premiere,every cast member was either unknown or little known. Ted Danson is Sam Malone,the owner and operator of Cheers,a pub and short order restaurant who used to be a baseball player. This series was based on a real establishment in Boston. Shelley Long is Diane Chambers,an aspiring novelist who is Sam's on-and-off girlfriend(she would leave the series after the 1986-87 season). Rhea Perlman is Carla Tortelli,one of Cheers' waitresses who is acid-tongued and often bitchy. Perlman's real-life husband(was then and still is) Danny DeVito's sitcom Taxi moved from ABC to NBC when Cheers premiered. John Ratzenberger is Cliff Claven,a mailman who frequented the establishment. George Wendt is Norm Peterson who was also a frequent patron. Nicholas Colasanto is Nick &quot;Coach&quot; Pantusso who worked as a bartender(Colasanto died in '85 thus being replaced by Woody Harrelson). It is possible that Cheers won an Emmy for Best New Series in 1983. Like The Jeffersons,Married...With Children and Happy Days,this series would last 11 seasons! Throughout the series,Danson,Long,Perlman and Wendt would have film careers.

745790,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00008NV4G,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 3]","There are a few shows that are always, and will always, be included on every list there is naming the best shows that of all time on television. One that has always been there since it's time, and will continue to do so, is the brilliant piece of work that detailed the lives of people in the quaint Boston bar known as Cheers. It's rare for a television show to be as perfect as can be and gain all the right accolades, but this show was one of them. Premiering in 1982, and finishing the first season at number 72, out of 72 shows(!), the bar where everybody knows your name became a national treasure and introduced the world to a cast of characters that would become some of the most beloved people to appear on your screen. Ex Boston Red Sox player Sam Malone(Ted Danson), snooty barmaid Diane Chambers(Shelley Long), tough as nails barmaid Carla(Rhea Perlman), dim but loveable bartender Coach(Nicholas Colasanto), perennial barfly Norm(George Wendt), and know it all postman Cliff Clavin(John Ratzenberger). You knew right away that there was something special to this show. The premiere episode, ""Give Me A Ring Sometime"", introduced Diane to Cheers, and got the set up going. There were many great episodes, actually all of them, but too many to list all. ""The Coach's Daughter"" was a strong and emotional episode with Coach trying to help his daughter who is marrying an obnoxious leech of a man. ""One For The Book"" is a classic with Diane getting involved with a young man who plans to go into a monastery the next day. ""The Spy Who Came In For A Cold One"" is classic Cheers when a mysterious man comes into the bar and everyone wondering who he is. Classic Diane is shown in ""Let Me Count The Ways"", where she is devastated over the death of her beloved cat, Elizabeth Barret Browning, and the gang's cold shoulder towards her. ""The Boys In The Bar"" find the Cheers regulars worried that their favorite watering hole might become a gay hangout after a friend of Sam's reveals his homosexuality. Classic. ""Someone Single, Someone Blue"" is a big favorite of mine. Diane learns her mother will lose her late husband's fortune if Diane doesn't get married. So, her and Sam try what they can to save her mother from poverty. The two part season finale, ""Showdown Pt. 1"" and ""Showdown Pt. 2"" is Cheers at it's earliest best. The Sam/Diane triangle was exceptional, and it really got going in these two episodes, especially when Sam's more glorious older brother throws things into the mix. My favorite ep is ""Diane's Perfect Date"", where Sam sets Diane up on a blind date with a man who turns out to be a nurderer. There are so many more wonderful eps and moments here, but there are just too many to mention. Just one of the great things about this masterful show. A lot of good stuff!. The writing was so strong, funny, and intelligent. Writing that is almost extinct in sitcom world nowadays. The acting was superb, and everyone had their own distinction to their character. It was, and still is, as well as with cast changes down the road, one of the most exemplary depictions of a pitch perfect cast. Season one is a treasure. Bring on seasons 2 -11!!.",5,"""Thank God There's One Place In The World....""",1080691200,"03 31, 2004",2004,3163,"['are', 'few', 'shows', 'are', 'always', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'included', 'list', 'naming', 'best', 'shows', 'time', 'television', 'One', 'always', 'been', 'there', 'time', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'work', 'detailed', 'lives', 'people', 'quaint', 'Boston', 'bar', 'known', 'Cheers', 'rare', 'television', 'show', 'be', 'as', 'perfect', 'can', 'be', 'gain', 'right', 'accolades', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'Premiering', '1982', 'finishing', 'first', 'season', 'number', '72', '72', 'shows', 'bar', 'where', 'everybody', 'name', 'became', 'national', 'treasure', 'introduced', 'world', 'cast', 'characters', 'would', 'become', 'most', 'beloved', 'people', 'appear', 'screen', 'Ex', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'player', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'snooty', 'barmaid', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'tough', 'nails', 'barmaid', 'Carla', 'Rhea', 'Perlman', 'dim', 'loveable', 'bartender', 'Coach', 'Nicholas', 'Colasanto', 'perennial', 'barfly', 'Norm', 'George', 'Wendt', 'know', 'postman', 'Cliff', 'Clavin', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'knew', 'right', 'away', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'show', 'premiere', 'episode', 'Give', 'Me', 'A', 'Ring', 'Sometime', 'introduced', 'Diane', 'Cheers', 'got', 'set', 'up', 'going', 'were', 'many', 'great', 'episodes', 'actually', 'too', 'many', 'list', 'Coach', 'Daughter', 'was', 'strong', 'emotional', 'episode', 'Coach', 'trying', 'help', 'daughter', 'who', 'marrying', 'obnoxious', 'leech', 'man', 'One', 'Book', 'classic', 'Diane', 'getting', 'involved', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'go', 'monastery', 'next', 'day', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Came', 'A', 'Cold', 'One', 'classic', 'Cheers', 'when', 'mysterious', 'man', 'bar', 'everyone', 'wondering', 'who', 'Classic', 'Diane', 'shown', 'Let', 'Me', 'Count', 'Ways', 'where', 'devastated', 'death', 'beloved', 'cat', 'Elizabeth', 'Barret', 'Browning', 'gang', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'Boys', 'Bar', 'find', 'Cheers', 'regulars', 'worried', 'favorite', 'watering', 'hole', 'might', 'become', 'gay', 'hangout', 'friend', 'Sam', 'reveals', 'homosexuality', 'Classic', 'Someone', 'Single', 'Someone', 'Blue', 'big', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Diane', 'mother', 'will', 'lose', 'late', 'husband', 'fortune', 'Diane', ""n't"", 'get', 'married', 'So', 'Sam', 'try', 'what', 'can', 'save', 'mother', 'poverty', 'two', 'part', 'season', 'finale', 'Showdown', 'Pt', '1', 'Showdown', 'Pt', '2', 'Cheers', 'earliest', 'best', 'Sam/Diane', 'triangle', 'was', 'exceptional', 'really', 'got', 'going', 'two', 'episodes', 'especially', 'when', 'Sam', 'more', 'glorious', 'older', 'brother', 'things', 'mix', 'favorite', 'ep', 'Diane', 'Perfect', 'Date', 'where', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'nurderer', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'wonderful', 'eps', 'moments', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'mention', 'Just', 'one', 'great', 'things', 'masterful', 'show', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'writing', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'Writing', 'almost', 'extinct', 'sitcom', 'world', 'nowadays', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'everyone', 'had', 'own', 'distinction', 'character', 'was', 'still', 'as', 'well', 'cast', 'changes', 'down', 'road', 'one', 'most', 'exemplary', 'depictions', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'cast', 'Season', 'one', 'treasure', 'Bring', 'seasons', '2', '-11']",Cheers: Season 1

745795,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B00008NV4G,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[2, 4]","Like one of the Bar's patrons we would regularly find ourselves in this bar every thursday night. And we enjoyed every Minute of it. I first started watching when I was 10 when the show first aired. I was young, so there are some jokes I didn't get, but I was always good at figuring out the jokes/content based on context. I was proud of myself, as no one in my family seemed to know of the show, and it was insanely funny (even for a young child) and it wasn't until the would stop to see what I was watching did they realise that the show was great, and then they started watching it too. I have always loved this show,not only because it was a show I found on my own, but it was a show that was well-written and showed a wide variety of comedy styles. Since some of the production team and writers have evolved over the years with Shows like Mary Tyler Moore and Taxi, it should come as no surprise that this was another success story. I did not realise at the time that the show did poorly it's first season, as I couldn't imagine anyone not liking the show. The characters were well developed and each had their own little backstory. Usually in comedies the supporting characters are just props used for when the moment is right, to add a line here or to add ""atmosphere"" there. While you had two sensational main characters (Sam & Diane) you had this wonderful menagerie of supporting characters that weren't just there to recite a line or two, but to make the atmosphere of the bar feel like a bar, to feel like someplace you'd want to go. Sure the fact that it's a sitcom means that the events in the show will be exaggerated, but we all know people who have done some of the things these characters have done, and we laughed at them too. Some say this isn't how a real bar is, and I am not really a bar person, guess I've never found my ""cheers"" but comedies are supposed to take you away from your real life, and for 30 minutes make you laugh or cry, or just simply enjoy the time spent with your ""friends"". The characters are so richly developed that you feel they are real people. you almost feel as if you're sitting on a bar stool with them. If there really was a bar like this in the real world, I'd go, because it would make my life seem so much more simpler and less dramatic lol. But, you've got to love these characters. Sam the ex-relief pitcher for the Sox, who is a recoverring alchoholic who owns a bar (I've always been a big fan of irony)His skirt chasing would make him seem more like a jerk than anything, if it wasn't for the fatherly Coach who had been hit with too many pitches (and holds the record) but he was always sweet, and took care of Sam, so you got to see Sam's more human side. You start to realise that maybe there is a basic insecurity behind what he does with women, but he's the kind of guy you'd want in your corner, as you can see he'll take care of his friends. Then we had Diane, someone who shouldn't belong in a place like this, but somehow does. Shelly Long Played her to perfection. When it might seem that we should hate her for all of the stress she causes Sam and the gang,she'll do something that will make her seem as if she belongs in the bar just as much as everyone else. I am glad that they didn't try to replace her character when she left the show, instead they took the show and the female lead character in a totally different direction. Kirstie Alley was great as Rebecca, no one can navigate the uneven waters of her mood swings as masterfully as she does. It gives the character a more real-feel. She should be a success, and so should never be in a place like Cheers, but we learn that she has her insecurities and misgivings as well. We find that her extreme business-like demeanor was just a mask, and she was in fact a semi-loser looking for success in all the wrong places. As Norm once said ""the Hive now has a queen"". Woody also did not replace the Coach, whereas Coach was the father figure, Woody was the naive farm boy from questionable roots who has no idea of what to expect in the big city of Boston, but the gang takes him in and protects him, and tries to nurture him as best as they can. Which isn't very good, but they try. Carla is the spitfire, the one who says what we'd like to say but we know we shouldn't. Carla has a soft side though, and you'll find that she never really goes after Woody as much as she does everyone else, because she looks out for him. And there are a few times when we'd understand if she did do something to Woody but she doesn't. A hard on her lucky woman who sometimes causes her own problems but always keeps her head above water. As for Norm, How many times have we wished we had a one-liner at the ready when someone askes a mundane question such as ""What's up?"" (My Nipples, it's freezing out there) Never in the history of television has one character been giving so many delicious one-liners. (it's a dog eat dog world out there, and I'm wearing milkbone underwear) & then there is his partner in crime, Cliff. A lovable loser and an annoying know-it-all who really doesn't know much of anything. But, most people in the bar aren't smart enough to really call him out on it. Except Diane or Frasier. But Cliff and Norm were one of the greatest comedy pairings since the early days of Abbott and Costello and Laurel & hardy. Now Ratzenberger is Pixar's go to man for voice acting as well as their good luck charm. Plus there has been an amazing run of guest actors, who either showed up for just an episode or for an extended story arc. And everyone always seemed as if they were having a great time, on and off the set. Cheers was one of the first shows to have the opening quip as I like to call it. Where it would start the show with a joke, and then go to the theme song, and it's got to be the most remembered theme song of all times. And I'm not just saying that because I love the show. ""where everybody knows your name"" is now a part of our cultural lexicon. And cheers always loved to end the show with a laugh or sometimes a memorable moment. Sometimes it would end on a serious note, but most of the times you were still smiling by the time the closing credits rolled up. Anyone who is a fan of well written television, who loves characters that are real felsh and blood yet still deliciously over the top, will love this show. If you've never watched this show in your life, take the chance on the first season. but watch it about half way through the season before you form an opinion. This show more than mosts seems to reward the regulars, the more you watch it and pay attention to the intricacies of the character the more rewarding the humor will be. those who watched the show from beginning to end will know how great it really is. Casual watchers who tend to make assumptions rather than pay attention, are always going to be disappointed, Cheers can navigate between low brow/slap stick type humor and then in the next instance supply you with more intellectual based humor. The more you pay attention to the characters the more you listen to the words, you will start to notice that the show was intricately written not only to supply visual humor but also to get into your subconscious. These characters are addictive and the writing is always on the mark. The worst episode of Cheers (which isn't to say that they are bad) is better than most other sitcom's best episodes.You simply can't go wrong by purchasing this series.

Unlike the hilarious Seinfeld, Cheers would occasionally toss in genuine moments of drama that contrasted sharply with the comedic atmosphere and worked brilliantly. This is because of the great cast and the superb writing. It is also because Shelley Long brought that ability to the show, something it simply did not have with Kirstie Alley. I liked Kirstie, too, but the relationship of Sam and Diane was far more engaging, compelling than Sam and Rebecca. By that time, Cheers had become a comfortable old shoe (thank you Dr. Crane) but still going for laughs and usually getting them.But it was in the early seasons that we were able to see Cheers at its best, often times raw and unhindered by conventional tv sitcom mores. Instead of teasing the audience for years before bringing Sam and Diane together, they did it in the season ending episode, and it was just one in a long line of classic episodes. In many ways, the second season was the best, where we were able to see Sam and Diane fall in love and then, in a very powerful, atypical sitcom moment they broke up. Shelley Long and Ted Danson were particularly effective, especially in their scenes together, working off one another, in synch at a level I have rarely seen in American comedies.The dvd sets are mostly bare bones, which is a shame.

745811,A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX,B00008NV4G,Ian Phillips,"[6, 7]","Cheers very first season premiered on primetime U.S T.V in 1982. Little did people know that this series set in Boston's most famous bar would become such a phenomenon that would last for 11 years and stretch to an impressive 270 episode run. Cheers was deservedly showered with many awards and was still on top when the show sadly ended in 1993 (with the final episode bringing in record viewing figures for the series).I was merely 2 years old when Cheers first swung into action. Of todays new generation of U.S sitcoms, Will And Grace (1999 -) and Friends (1994 - 2004) rank as my all-time favourites. Cheers is still near at the top of my list as the show is like fine wine - has gotten better with age! Obviously the clothes and hairstyles instantly date the series but overlooking that obvious fact Cheers still plays extremely well.At long, long last (and way overdue) fans of this classic landmark series in American television history can enjoy the series once again with the first season being released in an attractive four DVD box set containing all 22 episodes that were filmed between 1982-83 (as well as boasting a host of interesting special features including an interview with Ted Danson and a fun trivia game that tests fans knowledge of the series).The premiere episode of Cheers sees snotty academic Diane Chambers arrive at the infamous bar with her equally pompous partner only to be jilted before they were about to set off on a romantic vacation. In a twist, Diane is soon hired by Sam as a waitress and slowly succumbs to Sams somewhat brash charm. And that was how this fantastic series began.....What makes Cheers such a knockout classic was the wonderful contrast of characters. Former pro baseball player Sam ""Mayday"" Malone is a slightly cocky but very likeable character with an eye for the ladies. Diane Chambers sweet but rather niaeve way of thinking becomes a foil for sharp witted and very boisterous Carla. Complimenting these three key characters are Coach, the hilariously eccentric and dim-witted but sweet and good-hearted barman, the notorious Norm who is renowned for his permanent seating spot at the corner of the bar and Cliff who fast becomes Norms sparring drinking partner.Ted Danson as Sam Malone is at the central gravity of the show, running the aptly named Cheers bar with a cool efficency. Danson plays the down-to-earth, womanising character to great effect, bringing in a lot of the laughs where as Shelley Long as Diane Chambers (who becomes much more likeable and down to earth after the opening episode) is just utterly adorable. Ted Danson and Shelley Long both sparked off one another displaying naturalistic affection for one another and enjoying an electric on-screen chemistry. Sam and Diane soon became one of T.V's most popular (mismatched) couples. The fact that the two characters had both come from completely different walks of life added to the magic and chemistry of their complex on-screen partnership.Rhea Perlman is universally excellent as tough-talking, no-nonsense Carla. Her fiery spirit and witty put downs became another essential ingredient to the show and Carla's on-screen feud with Diane was always hilarious. Perlman's impeccable timing was always, to say the least, hilarious.The sweetness of Nicholas Colasanto's approach to his screwball character, Coach, is played with conviction and was like a breath of fresh air in the series whilst those two sparring drinking buddies played by George Wendt (Norm) and John Ratzenberger (Cliff) complimented the diverse blend of characters.Cheers first season was a knockout and a thriving start to the shows history. Every episode was fabulous with superb comic playing from all the cast involved. Most of the amusing situations that alternated between different characters in the show were all (mostly) set in the Cheers bar. The titles of the season one episodes are as follows:Ep 1: Give Me A Ring SometimeEp 2: Coach's DaughterEp 3: Sam's WomenEp 4: The Tortelli TortEp 5: Sam At ElevenEp 6: Any Friend Of Diane'sEp 7: Friends, Romans And AccountantsEp 8: Truce Or ConsequencesEp 9: Coach Returns To ActionEp 10: Endless SlumperEp 11: One For The BookEp 12: The Spy Who Came In For A Cold OneEp 13: Now Pitching, Sam MaloneEp 14: Let Me Count The WaysEp 15: Father Knows LastEp 16: The Boys In The BarEp 17: Diane's Perfect DateEp 18: No ContestEp 19: Pick A Con...Any ConEp 20: Someone Single, Someone BlueEp 21: Show Down (Part 1)Ep 22: Show Down (Part 2)The first season ends on the cracking episode where Sam and Diane finally get together after months of a tense, sexually-charged build up. The whole ethos of this first series was built on a will-they?, won't-they? premise. When the two did finally get it on, many viwers cheered to see these two loveable characters, that were so incompatable, finally consummate their relationship (off-screen of course).Cheers (1982-93) remains a milestone in American sitcom history and has enjoyed success across the world including Britain where the show became a primetime favourite on the network television station, Channel 4.

745813,AFVPGUTRFEFUC,B00008NV4G,"Jason Francis Smith ""Dogstar Opinions""","[0, 0]","Back in the days when Cheers was on TV in the 80s, I would have given this show 5 stars.  But today, in 2014, we are living in the golden era of TV shows.  Shows like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Sopranos, Arrested Development, Sons of Anarchy, and Game of Thrones have changed the landscape.  Shows are more authentic, more honest, more artful.  Cheers has little of that.  It has the basic premise of a dumb jock falling in love with a nerdy waitress.  And when Sam and Diane banter respectfully with each other, the show is at its absolute best.  Unfortunately, the sitcom writers of the 80s lacked imagination to take shows like this to the next level.  Their tank was small, and hence after a few seasons of clever and witty banter, the show devolves into one of humiliation.  Lacking the ability to keep the show fresh and edgy, the writers just default to embarrassing and humiliating the characters for cheap laughs.  No wonder Shelly Long (who plays Diane) eventually left the show.  What actress worth her salt would stay in such a sad pathetic role?  Luckily, the first season lacks much of that humiliation of Diane.  Oh there is 'some' of it... but for the most part Diane is a quirky, intelligent, quick witted, nerdy, open hearted woman who plays against Sam's shallowness very well.  Of course we find places where Diane is shallow, and learn where Sam is deep. It's a worthy story to tell, and with the wonderful cast and the Boston Red Sox Bar setting, it has atmosphere and charm all it's own.  Later seasons of the show have classic and funny moments, but less and less charm, and more and more humiliation.  Seeing these episodes again has been an interesting experience.  I see parts I really like, cringe at parts I used to like, but unfortunately almost never discover something new.  If you want a show you can watch over and over again, repeatedly discovering new jokes and layers, I turn your attention to Arrested Development.  But if you just want to spend some time with the gang at Cheers, I don't think you'll be disappointed with the first season here.",4,An Old Classic,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,2079,"['Back', 'days', 'when', 'Cheers', 'was', 'TV', '80s', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'today', '2014', 'are', 'living', 'golden', 'era', 'TV', 'shows', 'Shows', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Sopranos', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'have', 'changed', 'landscape', 'Shows', 'are', 'more', 'authentic', 'more', 'honest', 'more', 'artful', 'Cheers', 'little', 'basic', 'premise', 'dumb', 'jock', 'falling', 'love', 'nerdy', 'waitress', 'when', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'banter', 'respectfully', 'other', 'show', 'absolute', 'best', 'Unfortunately', 'sitcom', 'writers', '80s', 'lacked', 'imagination', 'take', 'shows', 'next', 'level', 'tank', 'was', 'small', 'hence', 'few', 'seasons', 'clever', 'witty', 'banter', 'show', 'one', 'humiliation', 'Lacking', 'ability', 'keep', 'show', 'fresh', 'edgy', 'writers', 'just', 'default', 'embarrassing', 'humiliating', 'characters', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'wonder', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'who', 'Diane', 'eventually', 'left', 'show', 'What', 'actress', 'worth', 'salt', 'would', 'stay', 'such', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'role', 'Luckily', 'first', 'season', 'much', 'humiliation', 'Diane', 'Oh', ""'some"", 'most', 'part', 'Diane', 'quirky', 'intelligent', 'quick', 'witted', 'nerdy', 'open', 'hearted', 'woman', 'who', 'Sam', 'shallowness', 'very', 'well', 'course', 'find', 'places', 'where', 'Diane', 'shallow', 'learn', 'where', 'Sam', 'deep', 'worthy', 'story', 'tell', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'Bar', 'setting', 'atmosphere', 'charm', 'own', 'Later', 'seasons', 'show', 'have', 'classic', 'funny', 'moments', 'less', 'less', 'charm', 'more', 'more', 'humiliation', 'Seeing', 'episodes', 'again', 'been', 'interesting', 'experience', 'see', 'parts', 'really', 'cringe', 'parts', 'used', 'like', 'unfortunately', 'almost', 'never', 'discover', 'something', 'new', 'want', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'repeatedly', 'discovering', 'new', 'jokes', 'layers', 'turn', 'attention', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'just', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'gang', 'Cheers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'first', 'season', 'here']",Cheers: Season 1

This would explain why the series, which finished 75th in the Nielsens with a 13.1 rating, survived on NBC's Thursday night lineup.Looking back on the series as a whole it becomes clear that one inherent advantage for &quot;Cheers&quot; was that no matter what joke the writers came up with there was the perfect character to tell it.  If you had a sarcastic barb then that went to Carla (Rhea Perlman), a dumb comment would come out of the mouth of Coach (Nick Colasanto), the arcane bar trivia belonged to Cliff (John Ratzenberger), the caustic non-sequiters and marriage humor was the province of Norm (George Wendt), the intellectual bon mots went to Diane (Shelley Long), and Sam (Ted Danson) played the Lord of the Come Ons.  Equally as important, the bar where everybody knows your name was an appropriate place for all of these types of humor.  As Diane says in the first episode: &quot;Where better than here to study life in all its facets?  People meet in bars, they part, they rejoice, they suffer, they come here to be with their own kind.&quot;But the most important thing was that &quot;Cheers&quot; made the opposite attract concept work.  Televison has a hard time handling romantic comedy.  Making it work, like on &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; is the exception; the rule is Dave and Maddie imploding on &quot;Moonlighting.&quot;  But Cheers managed to make the story of Sam and Diane with its on again, off again, really off, back on, never going to happen, then again who knows for several seasons.  On the eve of her elopement Diane Chambers comes to Cheers and while sitting on a barstool sees her entire life crumble before her eyes.  By the end of the night she is a barmaid and although Diane and Sam have nothing in common, they are doomed.  At the end of the season when Sam's brother shows up to sweep Diane off her feet with an invitation to Paris, we know that Sam will finally confess his feelings (&quot;Showdown, Part 2&quot;), although Diane has to threaten to run her fingernails on the chalkboard to get him to stay.  Then comes one of the great final clinches of all time.I always say that I liked &quot;Cheers&quot; before Sam left the show, which confuses people since it was Shelley Long's Diane who left the show (but managed to return a few times).  But my point is that the Sam of these early years, and the first season in particular, was a much different character from the show's second half.  There was a pathos to Sam, which disappeared when the mental image of him dancing with Diane when they were old and grey from her final episode faded away.  Sam the womanizer was a joke during those final seasons: but in this first year you can see how charming he can be: the point is amply proven when Sam tells Diane where he remembers seeing the same color as he sees in her eyes.  There is also an edge to Sam as an ex-baseball player (&quot;Sam at Eleven&quot; and &quot;Endless Slump&quot;) that disappears later on as it becomes one giant joke.When you watch the complete first season again on DVD you will see that there is a serious side to &quot;Cheers.&quot;  Watch Coach's daughter (Allyce Beasley) try to explain to her father that she is not beautiful in &quot;The Coach's Daughter&quot; without crying.  Of course that was the episode they showed to honor Nick Colasanto when he passed away.  But there is also the choice episodes that feature quick appearances (&quot;Sam at Eleven&quot;) and complete episodes (&quot;Pick a Con...Any Con&quot;) focusing on Harry the Hat (Harry Anderson).  Another thing that helps take the pressure off the Sam-Diane potential romance is the bumbling antagonism between Diane and Carla.  This is a constant note that can pop up at any time during an episode, but sometimes Carla goes out of her way to play with Diane's mind (&quot;Truth or Consequences,&quot; &quot;Father Knows Last&quot;).This is my favorite season of &quot;Cheers&quot; and I am willing to take on any and all comers who want to offer rebuttal to my claim that this is the greatest first season for any situation comedy in television history.  &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; &quot;The Honeymooners,&quot; &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&quot; &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show,&quot; &quot;All in the Family,&quot; &quot;M*A*S*H,&quot; &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; &quot;Friends,&quot; all got a lot better after their inaugural season.  None of them started as great as &quot;Cheers&quot; did, and if you want to discuss this over a drink I will have a cola with a couple of cherries in it, please.",5,The best first season of any TV

745849,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00008NV4G,P Magnum,"[2, 4]","When Cheers premiered on NBC on September 30, 1982 it got off to very auspicious start. The show was the lowest rated program for the week. From those humble beginnings, it would eventually last eleven seasons, become the highest rated program for the 1990-91 season, win an amazing twenty-eight Emmy Awards including four as Outstanding Comedy Series and become one of the most popular and beloved television shows in history. The show revolved around a bar, Cheers, owned by former Boston Red Sox reliever, Sam ""Mayday"" Malone played by Ted Danson and Sam's co-workers and regular patrons. Sam is a ladies man/playboy who is superficial and vain. He is also a recovering alcoholic who is kept on the straight and narrow by his mentor and fellow bartender, Ernie ""Coach"" Pantusso, played by the late Nicholas Colasanto. Coach is a kind-hearted dimwit who was also a former major leaguer (early on it is mentioned he played for the St. Louis Browns who were the doormats of the American League for years) and dispenses odd, but caring advice to Sam and the other patrons. Very little activity took place outside the confines of the bar. The first episode finds Diane Chambers, played by Shelly Long, coming into Cheers to wait for her fianc&eacute;e while he picks up the engagement ring from his ex-wife. The fianc&eacute;e never shows up and Diane accepts a job from Sam to be a waitress. Diane is a stuffy, uptight, highbrow who feels she is morally and intellectually superior to everyone at the bar and isn't afraid to let everyone know it. She becomes the immediate target of Cheers' other waitress, Carla Tortelli, played by Rhea Perlman. Carla is the exact opposite of Diane, streetwise and incredibly acerbic. George Wendt is Norm Peterson, the barfly who has a long running tab and a seat at the corner of the bar. He is an accountant who is miserable at his job and with his wife, the never to be seen, but often mentioned Vera. John Ratzenberger's Cliff Clavin was only a recurring character for the first season (his character was listed in the closing credits, not the opening credits as it would be from season two until the end of the series), but his persona as the master of trivial information and devoted postman and son is established. The first season would focus on the budding relationship of Sam & Diane. There was a constant tension between the two and it is the will they or won't they get together relationship that was the show's dominant plot. Outstanding episodes include ""Coach's Daughter"" where Coach's daughter brings her fiancee to meet him and he turns out to be a real jerk, ""Coach Returns To Action"" where both Coach & Sam vie for the affections of Coach's new neighbor (the episode ends with a hilarious pratfall by Coach down a flight of stairs), ""Now Pitching, Sam Malone"", where Sam becomes a TV pitchman and one of the show's all-time best episodes ""Diane's Perfect Date"" where Sam & Diane bet they can find the perfect date for another and Sam forgets to pick someone for Diane and must scour the bar for a last minute date and finds a guy Andy (Derek McGrath) in the pool room who turns out to be a motorcycle driving ex-con. The show featured numerous guest stars including Harry Anderson who appear in several episodes as con man Harry ""The Hat"" Gittes and helped pave the way for him to star in another NBC hit comedy Night Court. Other first season guest stars include Julia Duffy as on old friend of Diane's who Sam hits on, Christopher McDonald as a Red Sox pitcher who Sam loans his lucky bottle cap to in order break out of a slump, Fred Dryer as a local newsman, famous DJ Rick Dees, former Red Sox great Luis Tiant as himself and Boston political legend and former Speaker of The House, Tip O'Neil also portraying himself. Keenan Ivory Wayans has a brief bit in one episode playing a customer. An interesting bit of trivia, Paul Willson who would appear throughout the series run (and become a semi-regular) as bar patron Paul, appears in the first season but is referred to as Glen. Although its ratings were low, Cheers was a major success with the critics, many of which hailed as the best show on television. They were justified when Cheers won five Emmys at 1982-83 awards including its first win as Outstanding Comedy Series, Ms. Long won for Outstanding Lead Actress in a comedy series and show also won for best direction and writing.",5,Cheers Is Reopened,1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,4397,"['When', 'Cheers', 'premiered', 'NBC', 'September', '30', '1982', 'got', 'off', 'very', 'auspicious', 'start', 'show', 'was', 'lowest', 'rated', 'program', 'week', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'would', 'eventually', 'last', 'eleven', 'seasons', 'become', 'highest', 'rated', 'program', '1990-91', 'season', 'win', 'amazing', 'twenty-eight', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'including', 'four', 'Outstanding', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'beloved', 'television', 'shows', 'history', 'show', 'revolved', 'bar', 'Cheers', 'owned', 'former', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'reliever', 'Sam', 'Mayday', 'Malone', 'played', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Sam', 'co-workers', 'regular', 'patrons', 'Sam', 'ladies', 'man/playboy', 'who', 'superficial', 'vain', 'also', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'kept', 'straight', 'narrow', 'mentor', 'fellow', 'bartender', 'Ernie', 'Coach', 'Pantusso', 'played', 'late', 'Nicholas', 'Colasanto', 'Coach', 'kind-hearted', 'dimwit', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'former', 'major', 'leaguer', 'early', 'mentioned', 'played', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Browns', 'who', 'were', 'doormats', 'American', 'League', 'years', 'odd', 'caring', 'advice', 'Sam', 'other', 'patrons', 'Very', 'little', 'activity', 'took', 'place', 'confines', 'bar', 'first', 'episode', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'played', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'coming', 'Cheers', 'wait', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'up', 'engagement', 'ring', 'ex-wife', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'never', 'up', 'Diane', 'job', 'Sam', 'be', 'waitress', 'Diane', 'stuffy', 'uptight', 'highbrow', 'who', 'morally', 'intellectually', 'superior', 'everyone', 'bar', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'let', 'everyone', 'know', 'immediate', 'target', 'Cheers', 'other', 'waitress', 'Carla', 'Tortelli', 'played', 'Rhea', 'Perlman', 'Carla', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Diane', 'streetwise', 'incredibly', 'acerbic', 'George', 'Wendt', 'Norm', 'Peterson', 'barfly', 'who', 'long', 'running', 'tab', 'seat', 'corner', 'bar', 'accountant', 'who', 'miserable', 'job', 'wife', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'often', 'mentioned', 'Vera', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'Cliff', 'Clavin', 'was', 'only', 'recurring', 'character', 'first', 'season', 'character', 'was', 'listed', 'closing', 'credits', 'not', 'opening', 'credits', 'would', 'be', 'season', 'two', 'end', 'series', 'persona', 'master', 'trivial', 'information', 'devoted', 'postman', 'son', 'established', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'focus', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'was', 'constant', 'tension', 'two', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'together', 'relationship', 'was', 'show', 'dominant', 'plot', 'Outstanding', 'episodes', 'include', 'Coach', 'Daughter', 'where', 'Coach', 'daughter', 'fiancee', 'meet', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'jerk', 'Coach', 'Returns', 'Action', 'where', 'Coach', 'Sam', 'vie', 'affections', 'Coach', 'new', 'neighbor', 'episode', 'hilarious', 'pratfall', 'Coach', 'down', 'flight', 'stairs', 'Now', 'Pitching', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'where', 'Sam', 'TV', 'pitchman', 'one', 'show', 'all-time', 'best', 'Diane', 'Perfect', 'Date', 'where', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'can', 'find', 'perfect', 'date', 'Sam', 'forgets', 'pick', 'someone', 'Diane', 'must', 'scour', 'bar', 'last', 'minute', 'date', 'guy', 'Andy', 'Derek', 'McGrath', 'pool', 'room', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'motorcycle', 'driving', 'ex-con', 'show', 'featured', 'numerous', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Harry', 'Anderson', 'who', 'appear', 'several', 'episodes', 'con', 'man', 'Harry', 'Hat', 'helped', 'pave', 'way', 'star', 'NBC', 'hit', 'comedy', 'Night', 'Court', 'Other', 'first', 'season', 'guest', 'stars', 'include', 'Julia', 'Duffy', 'old', 'friend', 'Diane', 'who', 'Sam', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'Red', 'Sox', 'pitcher', 'who', 'Sam', 'loans', 'lucky', 'bottle', 'cap', 'order', 'break', 'slump', 'Fred', 'Dryer', 'local', 'newsman', 'famous', 'DJ', 'Rick', 'Dees', 'former', 'Red', 'Sox', 'great', 'Luis', 'Tiant', 'Boston', 'political', 'legend', 'former', 'Speaker', 'House', 'Tip', ""O'Neil"", 'also', 'portraying', 'Keenan', 'Ivory', 'Wayans', 'brief', 'bit', 'one', 'episode', 'playing', 'customer', 'interesting', 'bit', 'trivia', 'Paul', 'Willson', 'who', 'would', 'appear', 'series', 'run', 'become', 'semi-regular', 'bar', 'patron', 'Paul', 'first', 'season', 'referred', 'Glen', 'ratings', 'were', 'low', 'Cheers', 'was', 'major', 'success', 'critics', 'many', 'hailed', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'were', 'justified', 'when', 'Cheers', 'won', 'five', 'Emmys', '1982-83', 'awards', 'including', 'first', 'win', 'Outstanding', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'Ms.', 'Long', 'won', 'Outstanding', 'Lead', 'Actress', 'comedy', 'series', 'show', 'also', 'won', 'best', 'direction', 'writing']",Cheers: Season 1

Or as Diane would say Norman. Cheers is one of my faovrite shows ever, and with good cause. Although the show really starts to bloom in the second season, the first is still worth getting. The show starts off with a 35 year old ex baseball player for the boston Red Sox, sam, running a bar, along with his ex-baseball coach, and his bossy, always pregant waitress Carla. After only a few moments we met, inspiring writer/poet, bride-to-be Diane Chambers. When her boyfriend leaves her, she takes a job at Sam's bar, called Cheers. Norm is the same as he is in every season, a beer drinking, in-and-out-of-work, costumer. And hears a little known fact (Cheers fans should recognize those words), Cliff's character is only a supporting character, and has less scenes, than in any other scenes.Although the 3rd season and up are really my favorites, the first season offers us some of the smartest comedy writting ever. At only 37 dollars, and the free shipping option, if you order from amazon, this is a must have.Here are some things for Cheers fans to watch for.1. Coach - this character was replaced by Woody after the actor, Nicholas Colasanto died. Although I love Woody, and think the Coach and Woody are very similar. There is a certain charm found in Coach, that makes him a truely memorable character.2. Is that Paul? - For fans of  the later seasons of Cheers, you may remember a character named Paul. He was never a main character, but he was a often returning character. Although Paul is not in these episodes, the actor, plays random characters throughout the seasons, including this one. So for those who remember him, he is in at least one episode of this season.3. He loves her, he loves her not - Sam and Diane's story line is done perfectly. Although they don't get together until the end of this season, their comments, and arguments about each other, are not to be missed.Order this dvd set today, and when it comes out, sit down and revisit a place where everybody know's your name.",5,Everyboby Know's Their Names,1050710400,"04 19, 2003",2003,2126,"['Woody', 'Rebecca', 'even', 'Frasier', 'joined', 'gang', 'was', 'just', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'Carla', 'Cliff', 'Coach', 'course', 'NORM', 'Diane', 'would', 'say', 'Norman', 'Cheers', 'one', 'faovrite', 'ever', 'good', 'cause', 'show', 'really', 'bloom', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'still', 'worth', 'getting', 'show', 'off', '35', 'year', 'old', 'ex', 'baseball', 'player', 'boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'sam', 'running', 'bar', 'ex-baseball', 'coach', 'bossy', 'always', 'pregant', 'waitress', 'Carla', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'met', 'inspiring', 'writer/poet', 'bride-to-be', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'When', 'boyfriend', 'job', 'Sam', 'bar', 'called', 'Cheers', 'Norm', 'same', 'season', 'beer', 'drinking', 'in-and-out-of-work', 'costumer', 'little', 'known', 'fact', 'Cheers', 'fans', 'should', 'recognize', 'words', 'Cliff', 'character', 'only', 'supporting', 'character', 'less', 'scenes', 'other', '3rd', 'season', 'up', 'are', 'really', 'favorites', 'first', 'season', 'offers', 'smartest', 'comedy', 'writting', 'ever', 'only', '37', 'dollars', 'free', 'shipping', 'option', 'order', 'amazon', 'must', 'are', 'things', 'Cheers', 'fans', 'watch', 'for.1', 'Coach', 'character', 'was', 'replaced', 'Woody', 'actor', 'Nicholas', 'Colasanto', 'died', 'love', 'Woody', 'think', 'Coach', 'Woody', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'certain', 'charm', 'found', 'Coach', 'truely', 'memorable', 'character.2', 'Paul', 'fans', 'later', 'seasons', 'Cheers', 'may', 'remember', 'character', 'named', 'Paul', 'was', 'never', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'often', 'returning', 'character', 'Paul', 'not', 'episodes', 'actor', 'random', 'characters', 'seasons', 'including', 'one', 'So', 'who', 'remember', 'least', 'one', 'episode', 'season.3', 'not', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'story', 'line', 'done', 'perfectly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'together', 'end', 'season', 'comments', 'arguments', 'other', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Order', 'dvd', 'set', 'today', 'when', 'out', 'sit', 'down', 'revisit', 'place', 'where', 'everybody', 'know', 'name']",Cheers: Season 1

If she had worked for me, I probably would have fired her on her first day.  And Norm?  Comatose.  Coach and Woody are sweet, likeable guys, but they're out to lunch most of the time.  And the situations that pop up there are more pathetic than funny.  Diane and Sam's (and later Rebecca's) romance is a joke.  For some reason, though, I find myself watching these shows at least once a year.  The stories are captivating, but, in the final analysis, not very good for chuckles.

745862,A3A1NTONWQ1SP7,B00008NV4G,Sylvantha,"[6, 8]","Unlike most of the reviewers on this site, I was not a very big Cheers fan and started watching the series just so that I could understand what my friends were talking.  When I finally did start watching Cheers, it was probably into its latter seasons with the introduction of Kirstie Alley as Rebecca.  I must admit, I thoroughly enjoyed the show and not surprisingly I find the laughs comparable to present shows likes Friends.  But during this time, through references in the show, I was always curious about the earlier seasons, particularly numerous references to &quot;Diane&quot; and such.It was with rather guarded expectations that I picked up this first season as I really don't expect much from them.  Usually the characters are yet undefined and I thought the storylines were written with &quot;we may not be returning next season&quot; in the background.  The first seasons of Simpsons, Friends, even Star Trek TNG, for me, emphasized this point.Fortunately, I was very very wrong.The first season of Cheers was quite the surprise by offering a totally different type of experience that from the sitcoms that I had been used.  While I view modern sitcoms as pure comedies (enjoyable, but far from moving), the first seasons of Cheers had a great balance of comedy and romance.  While the latter seasons with Cheers was a great laugh, I don't think I ever pulled for any one character and simply enjoyed the stories for what they were worth.  However, with the first season, I thought the Diane and Sam story line was done brilliantly and I actually found myself genuinely hoping that the two characters would get together.The Diane and Sam story line seemed much more enjoyable... pleasant than latter stories between Sam and Rebecca.  In my view, Sam and Rebecca was pure laughs and while I certainly did laugh at their various exploits, now that I have watched the first season, I definitely don't think it has the same sentimental value as the Sam and Diane storyline.While I don't think there are too many people such as myself who jumped on the bandwagon late.  But for those people, and I guess anyone, I would definitely recommend this DVD.  It has certainly showed me that Cheers did not develop into one of the greatest sitcoms of our time, but it started out that way.",5,Definitely one of the classical comedies of our time....,1062201600,"08 30, 2003",2003,2291,"['most', 'reviewers', 'site', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'big', 'Cheers', 'fan', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'just', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'friends', 'were', 'talking', 'When', 'finally', 'did', 'start', 'watching', 'Cheers', 'was', 'probably', 'latter', 'seasons', 'introduction', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'Rebecca', 'must', 'admit', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'find', 'laughs', 'comparable', 'present', 'shows', 'likes', 'Friends', 'time', 'references', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'curious', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'particularly', 'numerous', 'references', 'quot', 'Diane', 'quot', 'such.It', 'was', 'rather', 'guarded', 'expectations', 'picked', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Usually', 'characters', 'are', 'yet', 'undefined', 'thought', 'storylines', 'were', 'written', 'quot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'next', 'season', 'quot', 'background', 'first', 'seasons', 'Simpsons', 'Friends', 'even', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'emphasized', 'point.Fortunately', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'wrong.The', 'first', 'season', 'Cheers', 'was', 'quite', 'surprise', 'offering', 'totally', 'different', 'type', 'experience', 'sitcoms', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'view', 'modern', 'sitcoms', 'pure', 'comedies', 'enjoyable', 'far', 'moving', 'first', 'seasons', 'Cheers', 'had', 'great', 'balance', 'comedy', 'romance', 'latter', 'seasons', 'Cheers', 'was', 'great', 'laugh', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'pulled', 'one', 'character', 'simply', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'what', 'were', 'worth', 'However', 'first', 'season', 'thought', 'Diane', 'Sam', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'actually', 'found', 'genuinely', 'hoping', 'two', 'characters', 'would', 'get', 'together.The', 'Diane', 'Sam', 'story', 'line', 'seemed', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'pleasant', 'latter', 'stories', 'Sam', 'Rebecca', 'view', 'Sam', 'Rebecca', 'was', 'pure', 'laughs', 'certainly', 'did', 'laugh', 'various', 'exploits', 'now', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'same', 'sentimental', 'value', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'storyline.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'such', 'myself', 'who', 'jumped', 'bandwagon', 'late', 'people', 'guess', 'anyone', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'showed', 'Cheers', 'did', 'not', 'develop', 'one', 'greatest', 'sitcoms', 'time', 'started', 'out', 'way']",Cheers: Season 1
745863,AKIV6FWJPWZ0Y,B00008NV4G,"Tara Plumeri ""Snow Bunny""","[4, 5]","The series pilot is a dead giveaway that the creators knew they had a hit on their hands - a lot of times you'll see a small difference in quality between a pilot episode and the rest of the series, but in this case the first episode is, quality wise, at the same level as the other 21 episodes.You can tell how long a show was on the air by the fuss they make when it eventually ends. And when Cheers ended, after 11 years, the fuss was huge.The premise was fairly simple and pretty novel - take one bar in Boston, now, add some regulars, including Sam (lady's man and owner of the bar), Coach (the dim, but lovable barkeep), Carla (the one barmaid, who is equal parts feisty and fertile), Norm (Norm!) and Cliff (Mr. Zip's answer man). Gently add one dumped and down-on-her-luck brainiac (Diane) and stir. The result is a sitcom where the next story is whomever walks through the bar doors next. Brilliant!While I love the humor and have come to appreciate the continuing saga of the bar regulars I like the style of Cheers the most. The majority of sitcoms involve some variation on the two-story, one family, suburban home, but Cheers took place in a bar. And that's it. Designed like a large stage play, the action never leaves the bar - people come and go, homes are mentioned, but RARILY does the camera leave the bar.The four disc set comes with a nice helping of extras, but not a lot. The best is probably ""Setting the Bay: A Conversation with Ted Danson"", a four minute short wherein Ted Danson briefly goes over his role on Cheers and his thoughts about its charms, but honestly it was pretty short (8 minutes, most of which is clips from the show). In addition there are the following four clip collections;""Love at First Sight: Opposites Distract""""Coach Ernie Pantusso's Rules of the Game""""I'll Drink to That: Stormin' Normisms""""It's A Little Known Fact...""Each features the best of the bits for each of the main characters, with the exception of Carla. The best would have to be the collection of Normisms - Norm's various responses to various greetings is a show standard and always good for a laugh, so compiling them all in one place is good for a hoot.And finally, a Cheers trivia game, which tests to see if you've been paying close attention !Now, if only I can get that theme out of my head...",5,IT'S A LITTLE  KNOWN  FACT ......,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,2315,"['series', 'pilot', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'creators', 'knew', 'had', 'hit', 'hands', 'lot', 'times', ""'ll"", 'see', 'small', 'difference', 'quality', 'pilot', 'episode', 'rest', 'series', 'case', 'first', 'episode', 'quality', 'wise', 'same', 'level', 'other', '21', 'episodes.You', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'long', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'fuss', 'make', 'when', 'eventually', 'when', 'Cheers', 'ended', '11', 'years', 'fuss', 'was', 'huge.The', 'premise', 'was', 'fairly', 'simple', 'pretty', 'novel', 'take', 'one', 'bar', 'Boston', 'now', 'add', 'regulars', 'including', 'Sam', 'lady', 'man', 'owner', 'bar', 'Coach', 'dim', 'lovable', 'barkeep', 'Carla', 'one', 'barmaid', 'who', 'equal', 'parts', 'feisty', 'fertile', 'Norm', 'Norm', 'Cliff', 'Mr.', 'Zip', 'answer', 'man', 'Gently', 'add', 'one', 'dumped', 'down-on-her-luck', 'brainiac', 'Diane', 'stir', 'result', 'sitcom', 'where', 'next', 'story', 'whomever', 'walks', 'bar', 'doors', 'Brilliant', 'love', 'humor', 'have', 'come', 'appreciate', 'continuing', 'saga', 'bar', 'style', 'Cheers', 'most', 'majority', 'sitcoms', 'involve', 'variation', 'two-story', 'one', 'family', 'suburban', 'home', 'Cheers', 'took', 'place', 'bar', 'Designed', 'large', 'stage', 'play', 'action', 'never', 'bar', 'people', 'come', 'go', 'homes', 'are', 'mentioned', 'RARILY', 'camera', 'leave', 'bar.The', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'nice', 'helping', 'extras', 'not', 'lot', 'best', 'probably', 'Setting', 'Bay', 'Conversation', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'four', 'minute', 'short', 'wherein', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'briefly', 'role', 'Cheers', 'thoughts', 'charms', 'honestly', 'was', 'pretty', 'short', '8', 'minutes', 'most', 'clips', 'show', 'addition', 'are', 'following', 'four', 'clip', 'collections', 'Love', 'First', 'Sight', 'Distract', 'Coach', 'Ernie', 'Pantusso', 'Rules', 'Game', ""'ll"", 'Drink', 'Stormin', 'Normisms', 'Little', 'Known', 'Fact', 'best', 'bits', 'main', 'characters', 'exception', 'Carla', 'best', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'collection', 'Normisms', 'Norm', 'various', 'responses', 'various', 'greetings', 'show', 'standard', 'always', 'good', 'laugh', 'compiling', 'one', 'place', 'good', 'hoot.And', 'finally', 'Cheers', 'trivia', 'game', 'see', ""'ve"", 'been', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'Now', 'only', 'can', 'get', 'theme', 'head']",Cheers: Season 1
