The next scene shows soldiers on patrol in the jungles of Vietnam. Finding a dead body causes a reaction for a new soldier. We hear about their lives. The sergeant checks the soldiers. &#8220;Lock and load&#8221; for the ambush mission. We hear about these soldiers, the &#8220;grunts&#8221;. They sit and wait for the enemy. Bugs annoy the soldiers. He sees the enemy approaching in the dark. Then shots are fired. One soldier is wounded. &#8220;Take the pain!&#8221; One soldier expires from a chest wound. One mistake leads to a body bag. Later they carry cans from the latrine. Does smoking offer relaxation? The song says &#8220;feed your head&#8221;. These soldiers enjoy their free time. On patrol they find a bunker near the Cambodian border. One sergeant investigates a tunnel and finds a hidden room. Another finds a booby trap. There is a report on NVA nearby.They find the body of a soldier who strayed from the group. There is a nearby village, people are hiding in pits. They find food and arms. We see the psychology of the soldiers (they don&#8217;t understand the language). Another sergeant shows up. &#8220;Break it up!&#8221; They are ordered to torch the village and round up suspects. Explosions tell of stored ammunition. There is a conflict between sergeants. Barnes has the respect of the soldiers. That night they find the enemy, there is shooting. Elias has a plan to roll up the enemy&#8217;s flank. Rockets explode. Men are wounded. &#8220;Adjust your fire!&#8221;. &#8220;Shoot anything that moves.&#8221; They are ordered to move back. &#8220;What about Elias?&#8221; Barnes finds Elias. &#8220;He&#8217;s dead. Get moving.&#8221; Helicopters arrive to carry out the wounded and the dead. They see Elias on the ground, pursued by the enemy. Can he be saved? The soldiers discuss what happened. Taylor says Barnes did it. Barnes says he is reality; &#8220;that&#8217;s the way it is&#8221;.Do they have something against him? Its six to one. Taylor acts alone. &#8220;What do you know about death?&#8221; The next day they are sent back. One soldier has a bad feeling. &#8220;Everyone has to die sometime.&#8221; No men can be spared. There is another attack. The enemy advances and trips a flare in the night. Taylor charges the enemy. A guided bomb hits their command post. The enemy overruns their positions. Jet fighters drop napalm on the targets. It is quiet in the morning. Taylor picks up an AK-47 then meets Barnes. &#8220;Do it!&#8221; Has he been changed by his experiences? More troops arrive. The enemy dead are thrown into a large pit. American wounded are evacuated. A view from the helicopter shows the dead. Taylor reminiscences about his experiences; he is going home.Oliver Stone joined the Peace Corps then was drafted into the Army and served in Vietnam. This is based on his experiences. The psychology of the soldiers here is quite different from that shown in movies about WW II. Which was more accurate? Stone won an award for directing this film. His other films are noteworthy: &#8220;JFK&#8221;, &#8220;Wall Street&#8221;, etc. The name &#8220;Christopher Elias&#8221; may be fictional, but a real Christopher Elias wrote a book about the crimes of Wall Street (&#8220;Fleecing the Lambs&#8221;).",5,The War in Vietnam,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,3379,"['Platoon', '1986', 'filmIt', 'men', 'leaving', 'transport', 'airplane', 'Body', 'bags', 'are', 'then', 'loaded', 'transport', 'removal', 'next', 'scene', 'soldiers', 'patrol', 'jungles', 'Vietnam', 'Finding', 'dead', 'body', 'reaction', 'new', 'soldier', 'hear', 'lives', 'sergeant', 'soldiers', '8220', 'Lock', 'load', '8221', 'ambush', 'mission', 'hear', 'soldiers', '8220', 'grunts', '8221', 'sit', 'wait', 'enemy', 'Bugs', 'soldiers', 'enemy', 'approaching', 'dark', 'Then', 'shots', 'are', 'fired', 'One', 'soldier', 'wounded', '8220', 'Take', 'pain', '8221', 'One', 'soldier', 'chest', 'wound', 'One', 'mistake', 'body', 'bag', 'Later', 'carry', 'cans', 'latrine', 'smoking', 'offer', 'relaxation', 'song', '8220', 'feed', 'head', '8221', 'soldiers', 'enjoy', 'free', 'time', 'patrol', 'find', 'bunker', 'Cambodian', 'border', 'One', 'sergeant', 'tunnel', 'hidden', 'room', 'booby', 'trap', 'report', 'NVA', 'find', 'body', 'soldier', 'who', 'strayed', 'group', 'nearby', 'village', 'people', 'are', 'hiding', 'pits', 'find', 'food', 'arms', 'see', 'psychology', 'soldiers', 'don', '8217', 'understand', 'language', 'sergeant', 'up', '8220', 'Break', 'up', '8221', 'are', 'ordered', 'torch', 'village', 'round', 'up', 'suspects', 'Explosions', 'tell', 'stored', 'ammunition', 'conflict', 'sergeants', 'Barnes', 'respect', 'soldiers', 'night', 'find', 'enemy', 'shooting', 'Elias', 'plan', 'roll', 'up', 'enemy', '8217', 'flank', 'Rockets', 'explode', 'Men', 'are', 'wounded', '8220', 'Adjust', 'fire', '8221', '8220', 'Shoot', 'anything', '8221', 'are', 'ordered', 'move', 'back', '8220', 'What', 'Elias', '8221', 'Barnes', 'Elias', '8220', '8217', 's', 'dead', 'Get', 'moving.', '8221', 'Helicopters', 'arrive', 'carry', 'out', 'wounded', 'dead', 'see', 'Elias', 'ground', 'pursued', 'enemy', 'Can', 'be', 'saved', 'soldiers', 'discuss', 'what', 'happened', 'Taylor', 'Barnes', 'did', 'Barnes', 'reality', '8220', '8217', 's', 'way', '8221', 'have', 'something', 'six', 'one', 'Taylor', 'alone', '8220', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'death', '8221', 'next', 'day', 'are', 'sent', 'back', 'One', 'soldier', 'bad', 'feeling', '8220', 'Everyone', 'die', 'sometime.', '8221', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'spared', 'attack', 'enemy', 'advances', 'flare', 'night', 'Taylor', 'enemy', 'guided', 'bomb', 'command', 'post', 'enemy', 'positions', 'Jet', 'fighters', 'drop', 'napalm', 'targets', 'quiet', 'morning', 'Taylor', 'up', 'AK-47', 'then', 'Barnes', '8220', 'Do', '8221', 'Has', 'been', 'changed', 'experiences', 'More', 'troops', 'arrive', 'enemy', 'dead', 'are', 'thrown', 'large', 'pit', 'American', 'wounded', 'are', 'evacuated', 'view', 'helicopter', 'dead', 'Taylor', 'experiences', 'going', 'home.Oliver', 'Stone', 'joined', 'Peace', 'Corps', 'then', 'was', 'drafted', 'Army', 'served', 'Vietnam', 'based', 'experiences', 'psychology', 'soldiers', 'here', 'quite', 'different', 'shown', 'movies', 'WW', 'II', 'Which', 'was', 'more', 'accurate', 'Stone', 'won', 'award', 'directing', 'film', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'noteworthy', '8220', 'JFK', '8221', '8220', 'Wall', 'Street', '8221', 'etc', 'name', '8220', 'Christopher', 'Elias', '8221', 'may', 'be', 'fictional', 'real', 'Christopher', 'Elias', 'wrote', 'book', 'crimes', 'Wall', 'Street', '8220', 'Fleecing', 'Lambs', '8221']",N/A

While some war films date themselves in a matter of years, Platoon is still a gritty, sad, and amazing piece of filming. The story is about a young American man named Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen, in a good role) who volunteers to fight in the Vietnam war. Through his eyes we see the savagery and horror of that war: needless killings, villages burning, and Chris' terrifying transformation from an innocent, quiet man into a brazen, bloodthirsty soldier. His enemy might be the Viet Cong on the outside, but inside he is battling the squad leader, Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger, in an incredible performance), a hard-core, nearly psychotic killing machine. He is opposed by Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe, outstanding), the hippie anti-war voice. Elias once wanted to fight, but his mind has changed. In the middle is the entire platoon, taking sides, with a civil war brewing inside the unit. Chris' struggle escalates when Barnes shoots Elias and tells Chris the VC shot him, but he sees Elias, nearly dead, running across a field. Before he dies, he throws his arms up, which is the picture on the cover. A heartbreaking study in the madness of war, it stands with Apocalypse Now as the greatest anti-war movies, and ranks with All Quiet on the Western Front as the most powerful anti-war productions ever.",5,"Sad, Brilliant War Film",997142400,"08 7, 2001",2001,1380,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'legendary', 'picture', 'Platoon', 'lost', 'little', 'impact', 'years', 'war', 'films', 'date', 'matter', 'years', 'Platoon', 'still', 'gritty', 'sad', 'amazing', 'piece', 'filming', 'story', 'young', 'American', 'man', 'named', 'Chris', 'Taylor', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'good', 'role', 'who', 'fight', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'eyes', 'see', 'savagery', 'horror', 'war', 'needless', 'killings', 'villages', 'burning', 'Chris', 'terrifying', 'transformation', 'innocent', 'quiet', 'man', 'brazen', 'bloodthirsty', 'soldier', 'enemy', 'might', 'be', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'outside', 'battling', 'squad', 'leader', 'Sgt', 'Barnes', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'incredible', 'performance', 'hard-core', 'nearly', 'psychotic', 'killing', 'machine', 'opposed', 'Sgt', 'Elias', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'outstanding', 'hippie', 'anti-war', 'voice', 'Elias', 'once', 'wanted', 'fight', 'mind', 'changed', 'middle', 'entire', 'platoon', 'taking', 'sides', 'civil', 'war', 'brewing', 'unit', 'Chris', 'struggle', 'escalates', 'when', 'Barnes', 'shoots', 'Elias', 'tells', 'Chris', 'VC', 'shot', 'Elias', 'nearly', 'dead', 'running', 'field', 'arms', 'up', 'picture', 'cover', 'heartbreaking', 'study', 'madness', 'war', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'greatest', 'anti-war', 'movies', 'ranks', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'most', 'powerful', 'anti-war', 'productions', 'ever']",N/A

My cousin was in Vietnam and he described the place to me and it definitely sounds like the movie.  I also have friends who have said this was a very accurate film.  Oliver Stone's main objective in writing and directing this film was to show people what it really was like in Vietnam.  He said in an interview that Hollywood had their idea of what Vietnam was like and it never was on cue, (the closest being ""Apocolypse Now"").To create some of the realism, Stone had the cast and crew do some military training in the Phillipines, which is where the film was shot.  Charlie Sheen is quoted as saying, ""It was so tiring, and when we were done we thought we'd be given a catered meal, but we're given military meals-ready-to-eat instead.  We slept in two man foxholes that we dug.  Stone wanted to grab the feeling of exhaustion and confusion, and did it exceptionally by putting the cast through rigorous conditions.  As you watch the movie, you might find yourself saying, ""Man, they look tired.""  It's because they are.Oliver Stone used several of his own experiences in Vietnam in this film, especially the scene where Charlie Sheen is so frustrated with the situation, he starts shooting his M-16 at the feet of a Vietnamese villager to make him dance.  He also said that the drug use in Vietnam had never really been accurately portrayed in Hollywood.Great actors, a great script, and a great director, Platoon is a great film, that was the big winner at the 1986 Academy Awards Ceremony.

152347,AH1KJ45IQTM4T,0792845129,Benjamin,"[3, 5]","This is a great movie that won Best Picture in 1987 and was acclaimed by both the public and the critic. Oliver Stone directs his first movie about Vietnam (the second was ""Born on the Fourth of July"", another great movie) telling his own experience about going to war. From the very beginning we can see everything about the military that they don't show when they recruiting (the ugly and painful true about the war). And the movie goes on an on until you see absolutely everybody completely nuts, doing drugs, killing randomly, even killing each other. This is waht war does with men. You are not a human being anymore. The movie is obviously rated R for violence, and there are some very tough scenes that make anybody cry. The toughest in my opinion is the one at the village, when they kill -among others- a mentally retarded (and of course harmless) young guy, and a woman. Then they set the village on fire, rape some women, and get away with it. The whole cast is excellent, specially Dafoe, who in my opinion nails his character. And the DVD comes with an excellent and terrific documentary called ""Tour of the Inferno"" (about 30 minutes long) about the film with Stone, Dafoe, Depp, etc. talking about the movie. There is also a commentary by Stone and a captain in there.This movie should be mandatory in all High Schools in America. If there were no soldiers, there would be no wars, and the war in Iraq looks a lot like the war in Vietnam. USA is making the same mistake again, and the government is so blind to see that (or maybe they don't care about the people, just about the business all the weapons' companies -Bush' frieds- are making out of it!). But let's be smart, let's just ignore the government. They always get their way. Let's be smart and close all ROTC programs from schools. How can we be so hypocrites and have those programs in schools? Is that the education we really think our children deserve? That does not happen any other place in the world, not even in Cuba. Let's invest that money on education. REAL education. How many trilion dollars have Bush wasted in Iraq so far? How much money does the government invest on education? On health? For the people who live and work in America? Parents: teach your children. Nobody should join the Army. Let the politicians -real leaders, not the bunch of idiots we have today spread all over the planet- do the job, we'll see how many would go. Let the Commander in Chief go to war himself. There is no question about it: there would be no war. They wouldn't go. They would try to negotiate, and try to solve conflicts peacefully.Again, this is a GREAT movie everybody should watch.

The truth is, having watched ""Salvador,"" Oliver Stone's previous film, I couldn't wait to watch this one. Stone got war as it is, in its graphic detail, and I knew that ""Platoon"" would follow that path. And it gloriously did - ""Platoon"" is one of the best war films ever, eventually receiving four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Now, this historic movie can be enjoyed at its best quality in an awesome Blu-ray 25th Anniversary Edition.The film stars Charlie Sheen as Chris Taylor, who, like Stone in real life, volunteered in the army to serve in Vietnam. He is young and full of promise, including a college education, but he gives all that away to serve his country. Bad move. Chris was not only in to fight the war and follow his convictions; he was in for the battle for the possession of his soul, an experience that would change him forever. He not only had to fight the so-called enemy, and endure all the hell, as he refers to the place; he also has to fight his own. He has been assigned under the command of two officers: Sergeant Robert Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe), two completely different soldiers, with totally different minds about war and the methods to fight it. While Barnes is a strong leader, with a vicious behavior towards life, Elias is more humane and understanding of the human condition, and who at one time tells Chris, ""We've been kicking other peoples asses for so long, so I figured it's time we got ours kicked."" The internal battles between these two men will play an important role in the survival and psyche of their troops, forcing Chris say to himself, ""Day by day I struggle to maintain not only my strength, but also my sanity.""""Platoon"" has been acclaimed by Vietnam veterans as a film that really reflected the cruel conditions and elements that they had to endure at war in the tropics - the mosquitoes, the mud, the rain, and an enemy that they couldn't see. We feel their pain, as Stone really shows the reality of war. Masterful, too, was the use of an incisive score by Georges Delerue, mainly with Samuel Osborne Barber's penetrating ""Adagio for Strings."" In the end, we are told that we have ""to teach to others what we know, and try, with what's left of our lives, to find a goodness and meaning to this life."" Well said; unfortunately, we don't learn, Do we? As mentioned earlier, the film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Directing, Film Editing and Sound, and it also stars Forest Whitaker, Keith David, Kevin Dillon, Johnny Depp, and others.

A young Charlie Sheen plays Chris Taylor, an idealistic youth who has volunteered to fight in Viet Nam, but who never bargained for what he got there.[Referring to Vietnam]Chris Taylor: Somebody once wrote: ""Hell is the impossibility of reason."" That's what this place feels like. Hell.Later on, after struggling to survive for what seems like an eternity, he has this to say:Chris Taylor: Day by day I struggle to maintain not only my strength but also my sanity. It's all a blur. I have no energy to write. I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. The morale of the men is low, a civil war in the platoon. Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes. There's a lot of suspicion and hate. I can't believe we're fighting each other, when we should be fighting them.Willem Dafoe plays Sgt. Elias, and Tom Berenger is Sgt. Barnes. A monumental clash of the titans ensues, a battle between good and evil. But in the chaos and violence of Viet Nam, it is hard to tell which is which.Sgt. Barnes: Saddle up! Lock and load!The cast also includes future Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp, Francesco Quinn, Kevin Dillon, John C. McGinley, and Mark Moses. I didn't recognize Johnny Depp at all, but John C. McGinley, who played Sgt. Red O'Neill, is the obnoxious Dr. Cox from the TV program Scrubs. Mark Moses has been on Desperate Housewives. Kevin Dillon is the younger brother of Matt Dillon. He is a very shocking character who seems completely without a moral compass. Sheen is seen every day on Two and a Half Men, which is now in syndication.Several of the actors wrote messages on their helmets worn throughout the movie. 'Charlie Sheen' 's helmet reads, ""When I die, bury me upside-down, so the world can kiss my ***"", while Johnny Depp's simply reads, ""Sherilyn"", a tribute to Sherilyn Fenn, whom Depp was dating at the time. Mark Moses (Lt. Wolfe) had on his helmet a drawing of MAD magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman with the phrase ""What, me worry?"" and, according to Tom Berenger, this caused Oliver Stone to laugh hysterically once during filming. Another reference to Sherilyn Fenn can be seen on Johnny Depp's guitar in the scene where they are smoking dope: the carved initials S.F. In many U.S. military leadership classes, the character of Lt. Wolfe is used as an example of how not to behave as a junior officer.Charlie Sheen is of course the son of actor Martin Sheen, who also appeared in an epic film about Viet Nam, Apocalypse Now. Apocalypse Now was loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but Platoon was written by Stone based on his own experience in Nam. Oliver Stone served in Viet Nam, where he was awarded a Bronze Star for Gallantry and a Purple Heart. Platoon is therefore the first major film about Viet Nam directed by a veteran. Stone wanted to tell what it was really like to counter the false image portrayed in John Wayne's The Green Berets. Platoon was an early success, winning the Oscar for best picture, and best director for Oliver Stone. Both Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger received nominations for playing the two Sergeants who are polar opposites, good and evil, or evil and good. Platoon also did well at the box office.FILMS DIRECTED BY OLIVER STONENixon(1995)Natural Born Killers(1994)Heaven & Earth(1993)JFK - Special Edition Director's Cut(1991)The Doors (Special Edition)(1991)Wall Street(1987)Salvador (Special Edition)(1986)Major Leagueand Major League II starred both Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen.

There's no way all the stuff in this movie happened to all units, or even to one particular unit.The trick to understanding Platoon is to 1) realize that Vietnam is a war that will never have a good reputation (for all the obvious reasons) and therefore this film can't and doesn't have a 'victory'. The film is depressing in that sense, but it is at least true to that theme.And 2) it helps to think of all the things that happen as a composite - Stone's rolling everything up into one unit in order to tell a story...The acting is TERRIFIC.

Oliver Stone let us see the war through the eyes of a young recruit Chris(Sheen), and his struggle to keep his sanity and his morality intact in this brutal war, that threatens to steal both things from him.The movie is not about the big aspects of the war, but more about how the men that fought and died in the jungles of Cambodia and Vietnam felt, the hopelesnes, the despair and the anger. We get a harrowingly look at the &quot;political&quot; struggle between sgt. Elias(Dafoe) and Staff Sgt.

My father, a Vietnam veteran and staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force said it best, &quot;This was a real accurate depiction of Vietnam.&quot; Before retiring from his teaching job at the local high school, he actually showed this classic war movie to his class. The reactions were very mixed.Charlie Sheen does a remarkable job as the new recruit in the Army Platoon. He conveys how innocentthe youth was during that hellish moment in history. Willem Dafoe also did a remarkable job as Sergeant Elias, a compassionate officer who is sick of war. And Tom Berenger delivered a very convincing performance as Sergeant Barnes, a hard-nosed officer that every recruit loves to hate and kill. When Charlie Sheen's character kills Tom Berenger's character near the end, you can't help but route for Charlie and for him doing the world a big favor. Getting rid of a corrupt officer who overstepped his authority.Like Martin Sheen did in another classic depiction of Vietnam, one Apocalypse Now, Charlie does an excellent job of narrating the film, adding an extra dimension to it. No matter how many films of Vietnam are made, nothing can top it, or hit it on the money the way Platoon did. If you are a student of history, you will love Platoon. It is a film that clearly states that war is hell, no matter how you slice it.

Well Platoon in essence isn't Vietnam, it's just a movie that happens to be about that war. Well it's certainly a well-made war film, it's not of the absolute best war films like others are but it's still definately worth a watch anyways.Inspired by Oliver Stone's own experiences in Vietnam, the film finds college idealist Chris Taylor volunteering for Vietnam, believing that poor people shouldn't be the only ones in service while the rich ones could stay home. Entering his group as an untrained rookie, everyone else basically gets on his case about everything. He's also torn between 2 rival factions within his very own group: one led by Sgt Elias and the other by Staff Sgt Barnes. Unlike most war movies which tend to have a certain objective (Private Ryan in the Spielberg film, killing Colonel Kurtz in Apocalpyse Now), Platoon is basically about surviving until you can go home.One of the nice things about the Taylor character is that even at times he gets caught up in the war and quickly catching himself. One scene has him almost sadistically firing his weapon at a Vietnamese's feet, using the old ""dance!"" gag, but 10 minutes later he's stopping a gang rape before it takes place. There's not a lot of quiet reflection throughout the film but you can tell they're being affected by it, including the well-known ""thousand yard stare"".It's funny that Platoon ended up winning Best Picture and Director even though to me JFK is the perfect Oliver Stone film. While Platoon is certainly a great war film, personally I found JFK to be better but oh well. Like World War II, you can say that one film is the quintessential Vietnam film whether you think it's Apocalypse Now, Platoon, or even lesser known films like Hamburger Hill. Regardless it's nice to have another film about the Vietnam experience. To me the Coppola film is about the long-term effects war has while this is more about that initial time in wartime.The film essentially is being triple dipped as their was an initial release, the Special Edition and I hear of an Anniversary edition. I'd recommend the Special Edition and didn't actually find out about the third until I after I bought this one.

These have been included along with several additional featurettes and deleted scenes.The first disc features an audio commentary by Oliver Stone. He talks about the challenges of making Platoon on a low budget and working in a harsh, unforgiving environment. This track is filled with fascinating personal insights and is essential listening for any fan of the movie.Also included is a commentary track by the film's military advisor Dale Dye, a retired Marine of 22 years with 30 months in Vietnam. This is a great track that is technical but also accessible and really makes you appreciate the amount of work that went into this movie.All of the new extras are contained on the second disc, starting with ""Deleted and Extended Scenes"" with optional commentary by Stone. Most interestingly, is an alternate ending for Barnes which Stone says he now wishes had been used.""Snapshot in Time: 1967-1968"" gives a historical perspective to the time period the film takes place in and puts things into perspective by exploring the origins of the conflict and how the U.S. got involved.""Creating the `Nam"" takes a look at how the filmmakers created the condition of Vietnam in the Philippines on a limited budget. Some highlights include a bit about how they created the village in the movie from scratch and did such a good job that locals moved in with no prompting!""Raw Wounds: The Legacy of Platoon"" examines the film's legacy and how it gave veterans the dignity they deserved and allowed the U.S. to come to terms with the war.""One War, Many Stories"" features a group of vets talking about the movie after a screening and how it relates to their own experiences.

Platoon is a movie to be watched and respected and not degraded because Oliver Stone took certain liberties with his own life story.Like Apocolypse now, Platoon's main star is Charlie Sheen (Well correction, it was Martin Sheen in Apocolypse) Williem Defoe, Tom Berenger and Johnny Depp. Both Depp and Stone have brief appearences, all us Depp fans who wanted more...well, just be glad he had his cameo, for it was wonderful. Also, just in case you can't pick him out, he'll be playing Pvt. Gator Lerner, and at the village he's the main interpreter. He's kinda hard to pick out since it was '84. So his career was just starting.Williem Defoe and Berenger play the Sgts at war with each other. Defoe is Elias, who has respect for his men and the country they are against, while Berenger is just there to get the job done anyway he possible can.

152374,AEMZRE6QYVQBS,0792845129,David A. Baer,"[6, 7]","Oliver Stone's brilliant 1986 film on the grunt's war in Vietnam had a lot to work with: a controversial subject well placed for dramatic effect, brilliant acting from his three leads (Dafoe, Berenger, and, yes, even Sheen), some stunning visual images (more on this in a moment), and the superb employment of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings. The result is a movie that must rank in the top three of the 1980s  and, to boot, one that is impossible to characterize cleanly as an anti-war movie (No one will suspect it of being pro-war.)Stone, a Vietnam vet himself, holds up the insanity of the infantryman's life for close inspection, but one is left to draw his own conclusion about the war itself. This might seem evasive of the writer-director's political point except for the added factor that he dignifies those who fought the war not only in his screenplay but in the dedication of the flick itself to them.One of a spate of late-80s Vietnam movies, Platoon is the most believable. Platoon endures as some of the cream of Stone's directorial repertoire in part because he manages to humanize his soldiers, never losing their misery, struggle, and--for some--residual and persistent hope in the face of the overwhelming horror of the film.In the end, Platoon is more than anything else a picture about fratricide. Sheen's Private Taylor says as much, though his commentary on the complex lives and deaths of Dafoe's and Berenger's dueling sergeants hardly requires that commentary to seal the point.Platoon is Oliver Stone at his best.

There's no denying his skill as a director, but it's his disingenuous politics are what turn me off.  I found ""JFK"" to be one of the most deceitful paranoid fantasies ever put to film.  What made that film so dangerous was that it was so well crafted that people believed it.  ""Platoon"" is a different animal completely.  This is the work of a man who is trying to come to grips with his past and ultimately put those ghosts to rest.  There have been many great films about the Vietnam conflict(""The Deer Hunter"", ""Apocalypse Now"",""Full Metal Jacket"") but those were works of men who hadn't experienced first-hand the war.  You can sense the urgency of Stone wanting to tell his story.  The fire-fights, the battles, the fear are all palpable to the audience.  Stone enlists a first-rate cast (Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, John C. McGinley, Forrest Whitaker, Keith David, Johnny Depp to name a few) that actually feels like a platoon.  Stone's alter ego here is Chris(Sheen) a college kid who dropped out to enlist in the Marines.  The internal conflict is Sheen being torn between two father figures, the ""good"" Sgt. Elias(Dafoe) and the ""bad"" Sgt. Barnes(Berenger).  The way these two conflicting personalities are written is heavy-handed at times.  The scene where Elias is trying to evade his North Vietnamese pursuers he stumbles and lifts his arms upward like a crucified Christ figure.  A later scene in a trench, a drunken scarred Barnes gives a speech to the platoon under a twisted string of Christmas lights that gives off a halo effect.  Dafoe and particularly Berenger overcome some of these indulgences in the script by giving full-bodied performances.  Despite some reservations, ""Platoon"" was a very important film when it came out in 1986.  There were still young men who had returned home from the conflict who had not come to terms with that period of their life.  This film was great catharsis for them.  The emphasis in this film was on the soldiers and it's important for today's audience to appreciate the sacrifices of these men then and now.",5,Stone's Best Film,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,2129,"[""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'work', 'denying', 'skill', 'director', 'disingenuous', 'politics', 'are', 'what', 'found', 'JFK', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'deceitful', 'paranoid', 'fantasies', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'dangerous', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'people', 'believed', 'Platoon', 'different', 'animal', 'completely', 'work', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'past', 'ultimately', 'put', 'ghosts', 'rest', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'were', 'works', 'men', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'first-hand', 'war', 'can', 'sense', 'urgency', 'Stone', 'wanting', 'tell', 'story', 'fire-fights', 'battles', 'fear', 'are', 'palpable', 'audience', 'Stone', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'Keith', 'David', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'name', 'few', 'actually', 'platoon', 'Stone', 'alter', 'ego', 'here', 'Chris', 'Sheen', 'college', 'kid', 'who', 'dropped', 'out', 'enlist', 'Marines', 'internal', 'conflict', 'Sheen', 'being', 'torn', 'two', 'father', 'figures', 'good', 'Sgt', 'Elias', 'Dafoe', 'bad', 'Sgt', 'Barnes', 'Berenger', 'way', 'two', 'conflicting', 'personalities', 'are', 'written', 'heavy-handed', 'times', 'scene', 'where', 'Elias', 'trying', 'evade', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'pursuers', 'arms', 'upward', 'crucified', 'Christ', 'figure', 'later', 'scene', 'trench', 'drunken', 'scarred', 'Barnes', 'speech', 'platoon', 'twisted', 'string', 'Christmas', 'lights', 'off', 'halo', 'effect', 'Dafoe', 'particularly', 'Berenger', 'overcome', 'indulgences', 'script', 'giving', 'full-bodied', 'performances', 'reservations', 'Platoon', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1986', 'were', 'still', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'returned', 'home', 'conflict', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'come', 'terms', 'period', 'life', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'catharsis', 'emphasis', 'film', 'was', 'soldiers', 'important', 'today', 'audience', 'appreciate', 'sacrifices', 'men', 'then', 'now']",N/A

How the twisted logic of war changes him and corrupts him and others in his platoon is the story of the film.To Oliver Stone's credit it can be said that this movie, first released in 1989, helped to shock a new generation of Americans into understanding just why our involvement in Vietnam was a tragic mistake and to warn us not to do anything like that again.  The fact that recent military adventures by the US have been limited engagements with limited objectives (instead of the vague and unrestricted policy of stopping the spread of communism, which was the rationale for the war in Vietnam)--engagements that have been carefully orchestrated to avoid becoming mired in the kind of hand-to-hand combat favoring the side defending its own turf as shown in this film, owes something to Stone's vision and to that of other film makers.  One also recalls Senator Barry Goldwater R, Arizona) who advocated ""winning"" the war in Vietnam by ""bombing them back into the Stone Age.""  Stone's film suggests just how impossible that would have been.Tom Berenger gives a splendid and somewhat horrific performance as Sgt. Barnes, the ""War Lover"" (the phrase is the title of John Hersey's WWII novel), who kills both friend and foe indiscriminately. Willem DaFoe plays his opposite, Sgt. Elias who is the model of the good soldier.  The rest of the cast gives fine support while the script by Stone, partially from personal experience, is full of authentic dialogue and veracious detail.  The clash between our civilized nature and our baser instincts is well presented.It is impossible to fairly compare this to other excellent Vietnam War movies such as The Deer Hunter (1978), Full Metal Jacket (1987), Apocalypse Now (1979), et al., because they are all so different.  I do believe that Platoon was more of a throwback to World War II movies in the sense that it focused on the dynamics of the soldiers immersed in actual battles with the enemy.  Yet on the other hand it falls completely within the Vietnam War genre by looking beyond the battles to address the larger question of why, and the war's consequences.  In World War II movies, the why was never in doubt, and the consequences were not an issue.The theme of this movie has been expressed as the loss of innocence, and that is a fair assessment; but I think it wasn't so much the soldiers themselves who lost their innocence, although many did, but a nation that lost its.

And the enemy was in us.""Thus the summation of Private Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) at the end of this film, a film about war, hate, self-realization, and survival.  PLATOON tells a powerful story that moves beyond the horror and gore of the Vietnam War, a story that ultimately depicts the demise and disintegration of a dysfunctional combat unit.  We see young Chris change before our very eyes, from a green, idealistic ""grunt"" to an embittered, disillusioned soldier.  Chris' platoon is dominated--and subsequently divided--by two strong, yet very different men:  Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe).  Barnes is cold, calculating, brutal, intolerant; Elias is compassionate, humanistic.  The battle of wills between these two men is just as challenging as the Viet Cong out in the bush, and just as deadly.  The film's climatic ending is powerful, spellbinding.I dismiss naysayers of PLATOON as a soapbox for writer/director Oliver Stone's political agenda just as much as I dismiss Mr. Stone's politics.  PLATOON hits you between the eyes with its depictions of warfare and human conflict, again and again.

It shares a similar trait with the best war films - it is more of a  morality play than a straight-forward guns and violence film.  If you like  &quot;Platoon,&quot; you will enjoy &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; or  &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; or &quot;Full Metal Jacket.&quot;  All are  superb films.Briefly, the plot, set in Vietnam 1967, revolves around a  platoon in which internal conflicts parallel those of the external war.  Charlie Sheen plays the lead role as a new recruit in what is his finest  role.  Other significant actors include Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe as  opposing officers in the platoon.  That's all I'll say about the film -  true, there is a lot of action and guns blazing in this film, but the heart  of the film revolves around the loss of innocence and ambiguous morality of  war.I have a few words about the DVD, which I just obtained.  This is  actually a re-release of the DVD.  The first DVD version is pretty much the  same, except that it had a commentary by Oliver Stone on it as a separate  soundtrack.  For some legal reasons, this had to be removed, and so the  first DVD was quickly taken off the market.  The &quot;re-release&quot; DVD  doesn't have the commentary, which I understand was quite good.  This is a  pity - serious film buffs might consider trying to find the first version  on internet auction sites.  Otherwise, this 2nd version is adequate.  The  picture quality quite good for a budget DVD and shows no compression  artifacts.  Sound quality is good enough, though the bass is not as loud as  one hears in latter-day, more modern films.  There are subtitles, and a  trailer, but that is it.  The lack of extras on such an important film is  disappointing; perhaps MGM will release a special edition at some far-off  later point.

One sees thick jungles with the constant fear of ambushes from guerrilla fighters at every moment without warning. It is indeed dreadful to see soldiers trudging in muddy waters, struggling in rain and crossing thick mosquito infested jungles.The film appears to be an open and objective portrayal of the terrible war in Vietnam. For example, it shows drug abuse by soldiers, killing of innocent civilians and some personal vendettas resulting in killings of war colleagues. Social and racial tensions are apparent as well as rivalry between junior officers and other ranks. This, in my view, is what makes ""Platoon"" particularly great by not glamorising war but as a mature and balanced critique of the horrors of war.The film is a story of a small platoon of men doing their best to survive during the Vietnam War. Based on this, the director, Oliver stone, (a Vietnam War veteran himself) directed a hard hitting and compelling account (if controversial) of the war. The movie shows the horrors of war and how it affects soldiers emotionally and psychologically. The long sleepless nights and ever present dangers eventually take their toll on most soldiers.This is a fantastic, if brutal movie about the livers of soldiers who fought the war in the jungles of Vietnam. The fire-fights, the battles, the fear, paranoia and everyday frustrations are apparent.

152393,A27VY7BUVD09I2,0792845129,"Eric M. Milillo ""Emills86""","[1, 1]","Written and directed by Stone, the story of ""Platoon"" is drawn from the directors own experiences in Vietnam.  Mainly it is a visual film that explores the harsh realities of war.  Through one soldier's point of view we see every aspect of the Vietnam War; booby traps, squad leaders getting fragged, slaughtering of innocent Vietnamese, soldier's mental torment, nighttime ambushes, guerilla warfare and even drug use.  Our soldier is Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a young middle class American who enlisted for duty in Vietnam.  Turns out Taylor is in for more then he signed up for.  Aside from battling Vietcong and his own mental anguish, he also must choose a side between his two commanding officers Sgt. Grodin (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger), each with their own view of the war.Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" is widely regarded as the most realistic film interpretation of the Vietnam War.  In addition to the aforementioned aspects, which were all true and realistic, add in a lifelike jungle setting and Stone's presentation of the enemy Vietcong, which were always kept lurking in the shadows and were made indistinguishable to make them seem as faceless objects of the war.  Although you would usually credit actors for incredible acting jobs, you also need to give Stone partial credit for that as well.  After all he did send his actors on a two week long training course that even entailed fake ambushes to motivate his actors.

152394,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,0792845129,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","Films that show the grim and hard-hitting environment of the Vietnam War do the job right for most of the time. Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, and maybe even We Were Soldiers really give you a sense of how the horrors of war affected the human psyche. Full Metal Jacket is by far my all-time favorite film regarding the Vietnam war. Platoon, directed by Oliver Stone, is also effective. In fact, it has to be one of the grittiest war films of all time. The nightmarish violence in the jungle really has a negative effect on the characters. While it's not really a favorite of mine, I do believe that Stone knew what he was doing, especially considering he himself was a Vietnam veteran. The entire cast (including Berenger, Sheen, Dafoe, Whitaker, and David) is excellent. The music is great: the extensive use of Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" gives the film a nice touch.Platoon is certainly an amazing war film, and it's up there with Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now.Grade: 9.2 out of 10",5,It's up there with Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,1022,"['Films', 'show', 'grim', 'hard-hitting', 'environment', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'do', 'job', 'right', 'most', 'time', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'maybe', 'even', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'really', 'give', 'sense', 'how', 'horrors', 'war', 'affected', 'human', 'psyche', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'far', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'film', 'regarding', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Platoon', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'also', 'effective', 'fact', 'be', 'one', 'grittiest', 'war', 'films', 'time', 'nightmarish', 'violence', 'jungle', 'really', 'negative', 'effect', 'characters', 'not', 'really', 'favorite', 'mine', 'do', 'believe', 'Stone', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'especially', 'considering', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'entire', 'cast', 'including', 'Berenger', 'Sheen', 'Dafoe', 'Whitaker', 'David', 'excellent', 'music', 'great', 'extensive', 'use', 'Samuel', 'Barber', 'Adagio', 'Strings', 'film', 'nice', 'touch.Platoon', 'certainly', 'amazing', 'war', 'film', 'up', 'there', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Apocalypse', 'Now.Grade', '9.2', '10']",N/A
152395,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0792845129,Erik North,"[1, 1]","It is an historical fact that the United States never lost a war until it set its feet into a country called Vietnam.  That is what is at the root of writer/director Oliver Stone's masterpice PLATOON, a portrait of that protracted ""police action"" against communism in southeast Asia that sent 58,000 American soldiers and almost two million Vietnamese citizens to their graves.Largely semi-autobiographical, since Stone served in Vietnam as the war was beginning to reach a fever pitch (1967-68), PLATOON places Charlie Sheen as a green Army recruit into the middle of the war, realizing after only one week of service that he made a very bad mistake.  The battles he faces are not just with the elusive Vietcong, but also within his own platoon--the conflict between the more level-headed and humanistic Elias (Willem Dafoe) and the vicous, cold-blooded Barnes (Tom Berenger).  Sheen's character is a survivor, but something is clearly taken from him during his Vietnam sojourn, as it was for hundreds of thousands of our soldiers and the Vietnamese people caught in the crossfire.  And that something is Innocence--always the first casualty of war, as the movie's slogan says.It took ten long and frustrating years for Stone to get this from the writing stage to actually making the movie itself, but the film's completion paid off in dividends.  In PLATOON, Stone shows that the Vietcong were tremendous fighters and willing to take chances, not the sitting ducks depicted in Sylvester Stallone's ""Rambo"" movies or, even more infamously, in John Wayne's THE GREEN BERETS.  It also shows how American soldiers bought their racial prejudices from home over to Asia and how, under the right conditions, young men can snap and engage in atrocious and barbaric behavior.  The film doesn't depict this as right or wrong; it just depicts things the way Stone remembers it.  The haunting imagery of death and pain in the film is magnified by Stone's decision to famously use Samuel Barber's masterpiece ""Adagio For Strings"" as this movie's musical calling card.Sheen gamely follows in his father Martin Sheen's footsteps as Stone's alter-ego Chris Taylor; and Dafoe and (particularly) Berenger are excellent as sergeants in conflict.  Berenger's famous quote sums up why he is what he is: ""I got no fight with any man who does what he's told.  But when he don't, the machine breaks down.  And when the machine breaks down, WE break down.""PLATOON justifiably won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director for Stone, making him a bankable, if often controversial, Hollywood powerbroker from here on in.  In later years, he would explore other aspects of the Vietnam conflict, especially in BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY and HEAVEN AND EARTH.  PLATOON is HIS story, and it is one of the most powerful films ever made in Hollywood history.",5,The first casualty of war is innocence,1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,2827,"['historical', 'fact', 'United', 'States', 'never', 'lost', 'war', 'set', 'feet', 'country', 'called', 'Vietnam', 'what', 'root', 'writer/director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'masterpice', 'PLATOON', 'portrait', 'protracted', 'police', 'action', 'communism', 'southeast', 'Asia', 'sent', '58,000', 'American', 'soldiers', 'almost', 'two', 'million', 'Vietnamese', 'citizens', 'graves.Largely', 'semi-autobiographical', 'Stone', 'served', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'was', 'beginning', 'reach', 'fever', 'pitch', '1967-68', 'PLATOON', 'places', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'green', 'Army', 'recruit', 'middle', 'war', 'realizing', 'only', 'one', 'week', 'service', 'made', 'very', 'bad', 'mistake', 'battles', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'elusive', 'Vietcong', 'also', 'own', 'platoon', 'conflict', 'more', 'level-headed', 'humanistic', 'Elias', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'vicous', 'cold-blooded', 'Barnes', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Sheen', 'character', 'survivor', 'something', 'clearly', 'taken', 'Vietnam', 'sojourn', 'was', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'soldiers', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'something', 'Innocence', 'always', 'first', 'casualty', 'war', 'movie', 'slogan', 'says.It', 'took', 'ten', 'long', 'frustrating', 'years', 'Stone', 'get', 'writing', 'stage', 'actually', 'making', 'movie', 'film', 'completion', 'paid', 'off', 'dividends', 'PLATOON', 'Stone', 'Vietcong', 'were', 'tremendous', 'fighters', 'willing', 'take', 'chances', 'not', 'sitting', 'ducks', 'depicted', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Rambo', 'movies', 'even', 'more', 'infamously', 'John', 'Wayne', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'BERETS', 'also', 'how', 'American', 'soldiers', 'bought', 'racial', 'prejudices', 'home', 'Asia', 'how', 'right', 'conditions', 'young', 'men', 'can', 'snap', 'engage', 'atrocious', 'barbaric', 'behavior', 'film', ""n't"", 'depict', 'right', 'wrong', 'just', 'things', 'way', 'Stone', 'haunting', 'imagery', 'death', 'pain', 'film', 'magnified', 'Stone', 'decision', 'famously', 'use', 'Samuel', 'Barber', 'masterpiece', 'Adagio', 'Strings', 'movie', 'musical', 'calling', 'card.Sheen', 'gamely', 'father', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'footsteps', 'Stone', 'alter-ego', 'Chris', 'Taylor', 'Dafoe', 'particularly', 'Berenger', 'are', 'excellent', 'sergeants', 'conflict', 'Berenger', 'famous', 'quote', 'sums', 'up', 'why', 'what', 'got', 'fight', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'told', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'machine', 'down', 'when', 'machine', 'down', 'WE', 'break', 'down', 'PLATOON', 'justifiably', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Stone', 'making', 'bankable', 'often', 'controversial', 'Hollywood', 'powerbroker', 'here', 'later', 'years', 'would', 'explore', 'other', 'aspects', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'especially', 'BORN', 'ON', 'THE', 'FOURTH', 'OF', 'JULY', 'HEAVEN', 'AND', 'EARTH', 'PLATOON', 'HIS', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'history']",N/A

Nighttime jungle scenes creep onto the screen with dramatic contrast while daytime scenes startle with vibrant greens. The aspect ratio of 1.85:1 remains from the laser and the previous DVD release of summer 2000. Still half-stepping is the 5.1 Dolby Digital mix, which is dutifully stingy in doling out surround information. Entire chapters roll by without use of the rear speakers, giving the effects an undue emphasis when they finally do kick in.  Stone's film -- released at Christmas 1986 -- has been followed by a host of Vietnam War films, but it remains in the upper tier because of its strong young cast, terse storytelling and attention to detail of the Army grunt's day-to-day soldiering and partying.

152398,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,0792845129,Frederick Baptist,"[2, 2]","Both literally and figuratively this is the offspring of that other great war movie. Both Martin and Charlie Sheen didn't get awards or nominations for their respective roles although both the supporting actors did give excellent performances.  If anyone deserved an Oscar it would have to be Dafoe whose performance is at least as good as Brando's.  ""Apocalypse Now"" took a much longer time to tell the tale of the madness of the Nam but ""Platoon"" seemed to come straight to the point and in so doing is the more realistic portrayal of what jungle warfare is really like and shows what can go wrong in the case of a dysfunctional platoon.A weak and incompetent officer is overawed by his diametrically opposite but extremely good at what they do sergeants who with lack of proper leadership decide to take matters into their own hands with disastrous results.  Speaking as one who has actually undergone jungle training having served a stint in the infantry I can testify that this film is about as accurate as can be with regards the conditions of jungle warfare.  Sheen's character talks about the constant tiredness which I can attest to but I would also add constant hunger as the two things to describe the experience.  The two sergeants also show the two types of leaders that grunts face: the one that commands respect by fear and the other that commands respect by charisma and a genuine concern for his men.  I'd choose the latter type as if you're gonna put your life on the line, you'd obviously wanna have a leader who gives a damn about what happens to you.This dvd is well put together as well although it doesn't have any real special features like making-of documentaries and yet the sound quality in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround is good and other than a few white spots in the picture frames at the start, the picture quality for most of the film is pretty good.  I would love to see a restored Blu-ray Director's Cut version if possible in the future although this version of the dvd is pretty good as far as standard version dvds go.Excellent movie and about as realistic a jungle warfare movie as you're ever gonna see makes this highly recommended.",4,"Best War Film I've Ever Seen!

152400,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0792845129,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 6]","At the time it was released, PLATOON was said to be so realistic that many Vietnam vets who viewed it had psychotic flashbacks. My best friend, Randy, served two tours of duty in Vietnam in the late 1960s, and because of these reports he was hesitant to see the film.  Ultimately he attended a screening in the company of some two dozen other vets who sat together to provide each other with support.  When the film was over they looked at each other.  ""Great film,"" they said.  ""But it wasn't like that.  Not really.""  Then they all went out for coffee and argued over some of the movie's technical details.  Randy says he has never met any vet who had a flashback episode from viewing PLATOON, and he regards the story as so much Hollywood hype.  Whether the stories of flashbacks are true or not, one thing is clear: PLATOON does not capture the Vietnam experience for all vets, and it seems unlikely that any one film ever could.Once we get past the film's reputation and actually look at it, what we have is an extremely well-done film that posits itself as ""typical Vietnam experience"" and then offers us an not-very-subtle morality tale.  Although the film focuses on newly arrived soldier Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), the storyline focuses on the battle of wills between an ultra-hawk faction led by Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) who don't care who they kill and an ultra-dove faction led by Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) who want to maintain some sort of sense of humanity and self-respect.  The factions soon errupt into an internal war, with Berenger increasingly portrayed as a demon from the pit and Dafoe seen as a Christ-like figure, both symbolically fighting for the soul of young and impressionable Sheen.In terms of combat scenes and violence, PLATOON is less horrific than you might expect.  There are shockers, of course, but the film achieves its effect less from graphic violence than from suspense, and here it is extremely successful.  Interestingly, the film also contains a covertly homo-erotic edge quite unlike that of any war film I've ever seen.  When the characters talk about women, they refer to them as objects and the few women who appear in the film are targets of rape and murder, so the film equates heterosexuality with violence; on the other hand, it is impossible to escape the connotation of the scene in which Sheen is introduced to (i.e. seduced by) drugs in Dafoe's lair, which comes complete with party music, twinkle lights, and such lines as ""put your mouth on this.""Although the black-and-white nature of the story is simplistic almost to the point of annoyance, a truly fine cast carries the film off extremely well.  Sheen is actually the weak link here: although appropriately All-American-Good-Boy he is not greatly memorable.  Dafoe, however, is astonishingly good, and although very one note Berenger is a powerful metaphor for evil.  The supporting cast includes exceptional performances from the likes of Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon (particularly effective as the loathesome ""Bunny""), and even a very young Johnny Depp.  But Oliver Stone's direction and script has a ""crusader"" mentality that undercuts any complexity the film would have, and PLATOON ultimately emerges as determinedly anti-war to the point of propaganda; consequently it never digs as deep as you feel it should.  But what the film does do, it does extremely well.

152401,AY12DBB0U420B,0792845129,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Platoon,"" a highly acclaimed film by Oliver Stone. The movie was excellent and seemed ultra realistic. Actually, I probably shouldn't say that in that I've never been in military combat. I was too young for the Korean War and I was in graduate school and deferred before the Viet Nam War got underway. In any case, being in military combat would not be my cup of tea. I once applied for a Navy ROTC Fellowship, because that seemed a better way to serve, but they turned me down, probably because of my poor grades. I might add, just as a little personal note, that I took the ROTC test with Jack Darby, a high school friend, and he not only passed but went on to become the Commander of the Pacific Fleet. Strange remembrance. In any case, I don't think I'd have enjoyed the military and this film certainly would have put that idea in concrete.""Platoon"" was the story of a small group of men on patrol in Cambodia during the Viet Nam War (about 1968). It's a grim movie. And it's gory. Most of the men had little idea of why they were there in the first place and staying alive was of the highest priority, rather than some high-minded idea of stopping world communism. Morale was very low and most of the men treated one another with a high degree of disrespect. Vulgar F-speak prevailed. Taking ""relaxants"" of one type or another seemed to be the order of the day. It was a war where your enemy was hard to define and locate, and, to top it off, there was a major and deadly division within the platoon where some of the soldiers were fighting and several soldiers were deliberately killed by their own men. Pity the small villagers caught up in this mess. The language barriers were immense and some of the people were shot just for being unable to give information. In addition, a village of probably innocent people was burned to the ground. It was a pathetic scene.Well, the movie was just exceptionally well done. Of course it got Academy Awards, and deserved them. The acting was superb and you actually felt that you were a functioning part of that dreadful little group of men. Everything seemed ultra realistic, and you may well not like it. This is not drone planes and smart bombs. This is on-the-ground, gut-level war.Gary Peterson",5,A Grim Movie.

Certainly, nuclear weapons did not make an appearance.  I can't imagine that carnage to be worse than the Civil War where Americans stood 10 feet apart and basically blew the tops of each others' heads off.  750,000 died.To me, Vietnam was a message to Russia/China: &#34;This far but no more.&#34;  We lost 58,000 men and women to make the political statement that communism would not stand.  This was a heroic act, regardless of strategic and tactical blunders on the field.  What this movie does is undercut the huge value of our Vietnam sacrifice by removing all honor and heroism from the story. If all the soldiers are drug-addled psychopaths, maybe what they're fighting for is suspect.  I do believe that the filmmakers are (partly) sympathetic to communism and communistic tyrants.We lost Vietnam through cowardly congressional acts that withheld battlefield supplies and reinforcements.  Truly heinous.  And now we don't &#34;win&#34; wars, we simply &#34;end&#34; them once political support dries up.

152406,A328S9RN3U5M68,0792845129,Grady Harp,"[8, 9]","Twenty years later, after PLATOON was released in 1986 and brought some of the horrors of the Vietnam experience to the public's media-jaundiced eye, at last the film can be seen and discussed critically.  'At last', in this viewer's vocabulary, includes the fact that more time for healing from actually being in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969 has passed, making the response to Oliver Stone's film more rational.  Now the film is a film, not a nightmare memory inducer, and that fact in no way diminishes the power of the message.Oliver Stone wrote and directed this musing on the effect of war on the psyche and emotional crippling that Vietnam produced in those who survived. Stone was there and that makes his cinematic lead Chris (Charlie Sheen), an random kid from a privileged family who volunteers to go to Vietnam for 'patriotic reasons',  an exception in the platoon to which he is assigned, the leader of which is  the mentally broken and emotionally scarred Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Chris' positive influence is Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), and the two are the polar opposites of evil and good.  But the main characters of this gripping film are the other kids who daily are subjected to the horrors of life in the Vietnam jungles with the atrocious living conditions of filth, rain, heat, vermin, and the constant threat of the VC hidden in the atmosphere, ready to kill them at any moment. And these conditions along with the destructive effects of the government's insane war result in mankind stooping to its lowest level, such as decimating a village of people in the manner of My Lai.The combat scenes are viscerally rigorous and well staged, but the odd thing about seeing this film as a veteran of that war is how watered down the atrocities now seem: scenes of dead bodies, both US and VC, lying on the ground or being scooped into mass burials ignores the fact that in reality what would have been seen are strewed body parts, unrecognizably torn by booby traps, mines, and powerful gunfire.But there is only so much the public can tolerate and so the film must be tidied up a bit. The impact remains in the eyes of the actors called upon to recreate the veterans.  Stone does his best to show the insanity of war, a statement as powerful as any that war must not be the answer in today's world.  And we haven't learned.  And that is what this viewer is remembering.  Grady Harp.

So from my friend named Anitra:""Well because it is one of the most sincere and a true outlooks on Nam ,I can't complain because they swore,killed or some used drugs,that was Nam.I am just THANKFUL that Oliver Stone had the therapy vision to make this movie. I am 66 and all of the men my age are buried . Such a waste of life,but they went and fought and did what they were suppose to. I use to get mad and yell at the protests and smart allecks cursing and yelling and burning our beautiful Flag as the men and  women were coming home from that non-war. I wanted to be a donut dolly,be with the Red Cross etc.. But my boyfriend who was trying to DODGE the draft had another idea, which I didn't realize.. I became pregnant,we sadly got married and I continued to be pregnant with 6 lovely children,and his goal was to avoid the draft. You had to go to the draft board with a note from your Doctor when you were expecting and then you were exempt. So I had  served my purpose and he didn't get drafted,while so many of our friends and a few family were kiled over there.  Eventually,he went on to spend his life elsewhere.He has since passed away,and i often wonder if all those boys from Viet Nam met him at a gate and said,you couldn't fight? I was blessed with many beautiful little sons and daughters to love and support who are now adults and amazing.. So buy and watch this movie and know THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. You faced the draft or you went to Canada or got a girl pregnant. I don't regret my family,but I regret he was such a coward and I was too young and naive .You were married and had children.Thank you again Oliver Stone for a dedication to SO MANY who lost their lives,limbs,mind and so much more over there,plus THEIR YOUTH.

Of those 4 movies, I also find this one to be the most emotional. Even though they are all tragic movies, this one made my emotions jump out. Goo thing that I didn't see it at the theater because I probably would have gotten kicked out. I was cherring on some characters and screaming and cursing at others.The movie is about Vietnam but it deals with it on an entirely different note. It deals with the amercians and some of the lousy, evil ones. I guess you could call Tom berenger a good actor because by the end of the movie, I WANTED TO KILL HIM! I was sobbing and couldn't help myself. It's a very emotional story about drugs, alcohol, violence, and treachery.Charlie Sheen is a young private learning under 2 lieutenants played by Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger. Willem Dafoe is excellent as usal in another powerful role.By the end of the movie, it's not even really about Vietnam, because this isn't a movie like Saving Pvt. Ryan where you see people shooting at each other. No. This time, this realistic movie shows americans when they weren't fighting...with the vietnamese. It shows the ugliness of some of them, the joy of others and the cruelty of someone caring more about his fame than the lives of his partners.

Platoon does a much better job than its predecessors (most notably the Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now)of bringing the realities of the Vietnam War home for an average viewer, just as Vidor's The Great Parade did for the Great War in 1925.  It shows the hypocrisy and immorality of the Vietnam war.  But despite all the preparations Stone put his actors through, I could never take their performances seriously; they just looked and felt too Hollywood.  While I recognize its poignancy, Charlie Sheen's narration still felt contrived and unnatural.  The scene where Berenger is over Sheen about to kill him when the bombs hit looked like pure Hollywood hokum.

Use whatever adjectives you want, this is one compelling, horrifying and numbing film. This is definitely a must-see for history students, would-be soldiers and politicians. Watch it and chew on it awhile.The story revolves around Pvt. Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a privileged kid who drops out of college to go fight in Vietnam. He begins as a green recruit, easily weakened by the jungle heat and unable to spot a bunker five feet in front of him, and ends wounded and disillusioned but with a fulfillment of the challenge that confronts him midway through the film.Oliver Stone immerses the viewer into the mind's eye of the soldier, with the chaos of jungle warfare and not knowing who or where the enemy is hiding. One begins to see why death and maiming by friendly fire were so common.From the opening sequence, Taylor quickly realizes he's not in Kansas anymore, as the clean recruits fresh from boot camp pass by a group of vets, and one man in particular with a look that haunts the young private.Although I've seen this film many times, the scene in the village still gets to me. Probably one of the most intense sequences Stone has filmed, with screaming women and children and a bunch of angry soldiers.There's also the battle in the rainy woods, the shooting of Elias, and the final battle where the enemy breaks through the camp perimeter. Luckily Stone injected a little levity with the heads and boozers base camp scenes.What this film is really about, is the man vs. man struggle that takes place between Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and how Pvt. Taylor is caught in between. Barnes is the battle-scarred leader who will do anything to win his war. Elias is the more compassionate one, mentoring Taylor and helping him become a better soldier. Berenger's Barnes comes off as having gone to the dark side, but this is a man who also cared about his men. Witness the aftermath of the booby-trap scene where Taylor catches him having a smoke. That's what makes him really work as an antagonist and Berenger gives one of his best performances in the role. Dafoe is also a well-rounded character, still a fierce soldier despite his humanism. Surprisingly, Charlie Sheen's performance even stands out after all this time. His character has a definite arc and he is very changed by the end, having learned from both Barnes and Elias, and from the war itself.The film may come across as too neat, with all the archetypes, and stereotypes, represented. There's the inept academy lieutenant, the psycho redneck, the surfer, the trash-talking brother, and an inexplicable fat guy that strolls out into the middle of a fire fight and thinks he can just yell at VC charging toward him and they'll stop.There are a number of actors in small parts that have gone on to various degrees of success, including Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, John C.

This is definitely not an uplifting flag-waving film, but what would you expect from Oliver Stone? Very real, and surreal at times, Platoon unveils the tragedy, destruction and dehumanization of war. Sheen does a decent job, but it's Berenger and Dafoe that deserve all of the acting acclaim here. Just bubbling below the surface of over the top territory, Berenger and Dafoe unleashe fierce performances. Though Stone does showcase the terrible truths of war, he also portrays the camaraderie and bonds of the men trying to keep each other alive. The fighting scenes are violent and scary and impossible to turn away from. This is a very dark and gritty depiction of the Viet Nam war. Naturally, one must compare this movie to other 'Nam motion pictures. I still think Apocalypse Now was the best. Platoon is pretty much tied with Full Metal Jacket. Some viewers compared Platoon to Saving Private Ryan- no way. Ryan was an epic World War II film, where there was a clear definition of morality. Platoon focuses on the &quot;greyness&quot; of good and evil. There was no triumph at the end of the film. What were they fighting for anyway? I had a major problem with American soldiers killing each other, but that was probably the point of the film. It's a good movie to watch, but not the &quot;end-all&quot; war movie that some think it is. What I enjoyed most about Platoon is it tells the story how Vietnam (probably) was. It says there is no winner in a war. It's miserable for everybody. It breaks even the toughest people down emotionally and physically.  I highly recommend it.",5,Death?

152421,A6N5SXNCSY0HS,0792845129,Jason,"[1, 2]","Most of the older war films, like with John Wayne, loose their sting after a couple of decades. It doesnt seem the case with Platoon. The movie still makes you feel the effects of the Vietnam war as you cringe and end up with shell shock. Oliver Stone (Born on the Fourth of July, JFK) takes what he seen in Vietnam and implies it into a two hour, gritty, guts and glory type film. Although sometimes you wonder if this or that really happened. The realism of the battle scenes and the effects it has upon the soldiers seems to be some of the best to date. This film easily surpasses Francis For Coppolas ""Apocalypse Now"" (which is still a more than superb feast of a Vienam war film). To say the least Defoe, Berenger and Sheen throw down their best performances of their careers. The additional cast is absolutely tremendous. They include Johnny Depp, Forrest Whittaker, John C. McGinley, Keith David, Kevin Dillion and even Oliver Stone. To see a more than realistic look in the war of Vietnam, check this out again and again. The story is about a new man in the squad Chris (Charlie Sheen), whose influences from the head Platoon leaders Alias (Willem Defoe) and Barnes (Tom Berenger) somewhat have an effect on how he goes about the war. Loosing his grip at some points in the film Chris is helped along by his two partying buddies Rahh (Francesco Quinn) and King (Keith David).

Is that because of a difference in what one remembers after the years, or because different people experienced different things and came away with different perspectives?I've spoken to many vets and watched this film more since my first review.  And I have to wonder, how is it that so many vets have such differing views on what they saw and recollect?

152426,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,0792845129,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[7, 9]","Director Oliver Stone has assembled an all-star cast for this fine film about the life of an Army platoon in the Vietnam war.  Charlie Sheen stars as Chris Taylor, a privleged college drop-out who volunteers for infantry duty in Vietnam.  He believes that its unfair for the poor boys to be fighting the war while the rich get to stay at home.  Once in Vietnam, he is assigned to a platoon commanded by Sgt. Barnes, played magnificently by Tom Berenger. Barnes is a hard-drinking, hard-fighting soldier who, according to the film, had been shot seven times and survived.  Barnes' only thought is to destroy the elusive Viet Cong.  Also in the platoon is another sergeant, Sgt. Elias, played by Willem Dafoe.  Elias is the polar opposite of Barnes.  He has grown tired of the war after several tours of duty, but he still believes in the fighting man himself.What occurs throughout the movie can only be described as a &quot;civil war&quot;.  Half of the men side with Barnes and his gung-ho attitude, while the rest side with Elias and his compassionate style.  The friction between Barnes and Elias reaches a boiling point when the group burns down a suspected V.C. village.  Elias believes that Barnes acted too quickly and threatens to report him to the C.O.  A fear begins to exist for Taylor and the rest of the platoon from both outside and inside.The fighting in the movie is very realistic and graphic, while the army life in general is accurately portrayed.  The fire fight at the end of the movie between the Americans and the V.C. is especially well-done.I've seen this movie several times, and I enjoy it each time I see it.  The acting is excellent, and the realism is first-rate.  Berenger and Dafoe were both nominated for Academy Awards for their fine performances, while the movie itself won for Best Picture.  Other movies released during the same time (Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill) were good, but Platoon stands out as the best in my opinion.

152427,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,0792845129,J from NY,"[2, 2]","Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" is an explosive tour de force which deals not only with the conflict in Vietnam but also tackles the fundamental issues of good and evil, the effect the 1960's counterculture had on not only civilians living in the US but soldiers abroad, and what it means to retain even a grain of morality in situations which may quite literally kill the average man at any time.I've known Vietnam veterans who love this movie and hate this movie.  While Oliver Stone is known to butcher history, and how, I don't think he'd lie about his own experiences as a veteran and I don't think he did.  People do horrendous things in war (the Mai Lai Massacre being the standard example) because war itself is evil.  When you put a group of men in a war that has neither rhyme nor reason to it and demand they stay in a dangerous jungle with a virtually unseen opponent, bad things are going to happen on both sides.  It's that simple.Stone takes pains to honor all variety of men who fought in this war, even the nearly psychopathic rednecks like Bunny.  A lot of people miss that--the last thing Bunny says to Junior in their foxhole, before we see Satan himself blazing in Barnes' eyes as he attempts to kill Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), is ""You gonna be alright in here with me, boy.""  While it is clear that Elias' camp of dope smoking hippie/tough guys are the ones who have retained their humanity (Johnny Depp and Forest Whitaker star in some early but prophetic roles) and Barnes' camp of hard drinking, racist nutcases are the ones so far gone they are able to ""do the whole f**kin village"" without feeling too badly afterward, both are given their due in different points of the movie.  He honors their bravery and service even if he despises them individually.Sgt. Elias Grodin (Wilem Defoe) and Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger) are both fantastic soldiers with not only the capacity to survive the attacks of the VC themselves, but also have the ability to rescue the naive grunts from sudden death.  We notice almost immediately that Elias--an inoffensive senior officer who retains a sense of conscience throughout the grisly ordeal--is the one who utilizes this, showing compassion to his crazed troops, even getting them high to calm them down.Sgt. Barnes, on the other hand, is almost like the Grim Reaper.  With his mutilated face, huge arms, hunting knife and green bandana, he fuels the animalistic impulses for immediate revenge and retaliation in the platoon to the point where they become capable of almost anything.  He has come to hate the ""enemy"" to the point where he is capable of putting a pistol to the head of a small Vietnamese girl to get information.  Perhaps his only value is that he understands the psychology of the NKVD very well.  Sgt. Barnes is intended to represent ""the establishment"", the alphamale figure who disdains freedom in favor of fascist order, the cracker with an intense desire not only to command but to punish dissent severely.Elias in his own way is a disillusioning figure because though he is a patriot he is completely out of his element: the cowardly Lieutenant who doesn't have a fifth of the control over his own men that Barnes himself does also idolizes him, and ignores Elias' advice during combat in favor of more aggressive approaches.  Barnes himself fears Elias because he sees a mirror image of his own twisted soul in the man but is no longer able to return to a place of purity.  Elias knows the war is futile but refuses to leave his men.  Barnes refuses to surrender because he believes he can control everything and has the pride of Moloch.An inevitable collision of wills occur between these two men, leaving Chris almost completely crazed.  He knows he has to do something but does not have Elias' courage and is terrified, as he should be, of Barnes.These two titanic figures do not represent the whole of the film, however.  The combat scenes are horrifying and Stone managed to bring out the best and worst in human nature from each character very realistically.  Some kindle hope and some are resigned to death.  The beginning of the film features an ambush by the Vietcong which leaves one seemingly warmhearted, brand new recruit dead.  Along with Elias' death, or perhaps even more so, this was the most difficult to endure for me: the pointless snuffing out of human life that these kind of conflicts consist of.  All it takes is one bullet or one bomb--made by the hands of either side--to maim or destroy a life forever.  This is an absolute masterpiece from an uneven director.",5,"""Death...what do you boys know about death?""",1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,4570,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'Platoon', 'explosive', 'tour', 'force', 'not', 'only', 'conflict', 'Vietnam', 'also', 'fundamental', 'issues', 'good', 'evil', 'effect', '1960', 'counterculture', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'living', 'US', 'soldiers', 'abroad', 'what', 'retain', 'even', 'grain', 'morality', 'situations', 'may', 'quite', 'literally', 'kill', 'average', 'man', 'time.I', ""'ve"", 'known', 'Vietnam', 'veterans', 'who', 'love', 'movie', 'hate', 'movie', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'known', 'butcher', 'history', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'lie', 'own', 'experiences', 'veteran', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'People', 'do', 'horrendous', 'things', 'war', 'Mai', 'Lai', 'Massacre', 'being', 'standard', 'example', 'war', 'evil', 'When', 'put', 'group', 'men', 'war', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'demand', 'stay', 'dangerous', 'jungle', 'virtually', 'unseen', 'opponent', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'happen', 'sides', 'simple.Stone', 'pains', 'honor', 'variety', 'men', 'who', 'fought', 'war', 'even', 'nearly', 'psychopathic', 'rednecks', 'Bunny', 'lot', 'people', 'miss', 'last', 'thing', 'Bunny', 'Junior', 'foxhole', 'see', 'Satan', 'blazing', 'Barnes', 'eyes', 'kill', 'Chris', 'Taylor', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'gon', 'be', 'alright', 'here', 'boy', 'clear', 'Elias', 'camp', 'dope', 'smoking', 'hippie/tough', 'guys', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'retained', 'humanity', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'star', 'early', 'prophetic', 'roles', 'Barnes', 'camp', 'hard', 'drinking', 'racist', 'nutcases', 'are', 'ones', 'so', 'far', 'gone', 'are', 'able', 'do', 'whole', 'f**kin', 'village', 'feeling', 'too', 'badly', 'afterward', 'are', 'given', 'due', 'different', 'points', 'movie', 'bravery', 'service', 'even', 'individually.Sgt', 'Elias', 'Grodin', 'Wilem', 'Defoe', 'Sgt', 'Bob', 'Barnes', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'are', 'fantastic', 'soldiers', 'not', 'only', 'capacity', 'survive', 'attacks', 'VC', 'also', 'have', 'ability', 'rescue', 'naive', 'grunts', 'sudden', 'death', 'notice', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Elias', 'inoffensive', 'senior', 'officer', 'who', 'sense', 'conscience', 'grisly', 'ordeal', 'one', 'who', 'showing', 'compassion', 'crazed', 'troops', 'even', 'getting', 'high', 'calm', 'down.Sgt', 'Barnes', 'other', 'hand', 'almost', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'mutilated', 'face', 'huge', 'arms', 'hunting', 'knife', 'green', 'bandana', 'animalistic', 'impulses', 'immediate', 'revenge', 'retaliation', 'platoon', 'point', 'where', 'become', 'capable', 'almost', 'anything', 'come', 'hate', 'enemy', 'point', 'where', 'capable', 'putting', 'pistol', 'head', 'small', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'get', 'information', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'value', 'psychology', 'NKVD', 'very', 'well', 'Sgt', 'Barnes', 'intended', 'represent', 'establishment', 'alphamale', 'figure', 'who', 'freedom', 'favor', 'fascist', 'order', 'cracker', 'intense', 'desire', 'not', 'only', 'command', 'punish', 'dissent', 'severely.Elias', 'own', 'way', 'disillusioning', 'figure', 'patriot', 'completely', 'element', 'cowardly', 'Lieutenant', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'fifth', 'control', 'own', 'men', 'Barnes', 'also', 'idolizes', 'Elias', 'advice', 'combat', 'favor', 'more', 'aggressive', 'approaches', 'Barnes', 'fears', 'Elias', 'mirror', 'image', 'own', 'twisted', 'soul', 'man', 'longer', 'able', 'return', 'place', 'purity', 'Elias', 'war', 'futile', 'leave', 'men', 'Barnes', 'surrender', 'can', 'control', 'everything', 'pride', 'Moloch.An', 'inevitable', 'collision', 'wills', 'occur', 'two', 'men', 'leaving', 'Chris', 'almost', 'completely', 'crazed', 'do', 'something', 'not', 'have', 'Elias', 'courage', 'terrified', 'should', 'be', 'Barnes.These', 'two', 'titanic', 'figures', 'do', 'not', 'represent', 'whole', 'film', 'however', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'horrifying', 'Stone', 'managed', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'worst', 'human', 'nature', 'character', 'very', 'realistically', 'kindle', 'hope', 'are', 'resigned', 'death', 'beginning', 'film', 'ambush', 'Vietcong', 'one', 'seemingly', 'warmhearted', 'brand', 'new', 'recruit', 'dead', 'Elias', 'death', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'most', 'difficult', 'endure', 'pointless', 'snuffing', 'human', 'life', 'kind', 'conflicts', 'consist', 'one', 'bullet', 'one', 'bomb', 'made', 'hands', 'side', 'maim', 'destroy', 'life', 'forever', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'uneven', 'director']",N/A

After seeing it tonight, I'd say that it is still one of the most visceral war films I've experienced outside of Apocalypse Now. This is THE FILM that put little Charlie on the map and it's a beaut. A fitting tribute to Veteran's Day and a fitting complement to History Channel's amazing doc Vietnam HD.For those who've been asleep or on Mars the past 30 years, Platoon is about a college dropout named Chris, played by Charlie Sheen, who enlists in the Army and his odyssey in a combat platoon under seargents Elias and Barnes, played by Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger, who represent the opposite sides of the war at that time in American culture, one representing the war machine and one who opposes it, 2 sides of a coin in a tug of war for Chris's soul. In the course of various skirmishes and objectives, one resulting in the assassination of a fellow soldier, Chris is forced to choose between his conscience or the dark side that has consumed the landscape around him.This film is like a first-person shooter, allowing you to see, through the eyes of the central character, the war from the inside out, from the subjective standpoint of an individual and not how it was from a generic point of view. There are as many perspectives on wars as those who've fought them. But this film is a fictional account of the director's (Oliver Stone) first-hand experience in this war and it is a doozie and one hell of a  ride. No matter how well a movie like this is made, it's impossible for those of us on the outside to really comprehend the actions of those who've actually been there and the things they were compelled to do out of the extreme unimaginative pressures they were under. This film doesn't preach, doesn't direct us to think one way or another. This is one of those films that simply presents itself for us to watch and think about. There are truly no good guys or bad guys in Platoon, only boys who were drafted and volunteered to serve their country, no questions asked.

Further, I don't know if I've ever agreed with a thing that the Sheen family has said.  Yet even though some of my political pals disdain this movie, I feel differently.  I half-expected a heavy dose of lefty propaganda and intentional distortion, but for the most part was pleasantly surprised.  I try to evaluate every item I encounter fairly and individually (instead of a knee jerk reaction), and these are my thoughts on Platoon, after viewing it again tonight:On the 'positive' side, the film rightly shows the awfulness of war.  Again and again, liberals seem to think that those on the right somehow deny this.  Of course we do not!  I give the movie high marks for depicting war as a living nightmare.  Personally, I cringe when some of the older movies represent war as little more than a comic book boys' fantasy.  I also thought Platoon contained some admirable acting (Sheen, Dafoe, Berenger, David), and combat scenes.  It held me throughout.The one major criticism I would make, and the flaw that keeps it from being an elite film in my opinion, is the way in which it reaches too far to show the dark side and corruption of the soldiers (American).  Stone has a crippling weakness for sensationalism (evidence: JFK), and it seeped through some here.  For instance, you cannot take the worst atrocities (even if they are all factual, which I question) and then portray them as representative of a typical company of soldiers and their Vietnam experience.  Yet this was the impression given.  In fact, it was basically the story.  This is irresponsible and misleading.  One of the film's few faults, but a bad one.However, when considered as a whole, Platoon has much to commend it.  While it is unfortunate that its weaknesses diminish its merit, they do not ruin it.  I'd be very surprised if Stone ever makes another movie nearly as good.",4,"Conservatives, You Can Come Out of Your Foxholes",1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2032,"['First', 'let', 'lay', 'cards', 'table', ""'m"", 'conservative', 'Republican', 'am', 'generally', 'pro-military', 'i.e', 'U.S.', 'distrust', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Further', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'agreed', 'thing', 'Sheen', 'family', 'said', 'even', 'political', 'pals', 'disdain', 'movie', 'feel', 'differently', 'half-expected', 'heavy', 'dose', 'lefty', 'propaganda', 'intentional', 'distortion', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'try', 'evaluate', 'item', 'encounter', 'fairly', 'individually', 'instead', 'knee', 'jerk', 'reaction', 'are', 'thoughts', 'Platoon', 'viewing', 'again', 'tonight', ""'positive"", 'side', 'film', 'rightly', 'awfulness', 'war', 'Again', 'again', 'liberals', 'seem', 'think', 'right', 'somehow', 'deny', 'course', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'marks', 'depicting', 'war', 'living', 'nightmare', 'Personally', 'cringe', 'when', 'older', 'movies', 'represent', 'war', 'little', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'boys', 'fantasy', 'also', 'thought', 'Platoon', 'contained', 'admirable', 'acting', 'Sheen', 'Dafoe', 'Berenger', 'David', 'combat', 'scenes', 'held', 'throughout.The', 'one', 'major', 'criticism', 'would', 'make', 'flaw', 'being', 'elite', 'film', 'opinion', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'show', 'dark', 'side', 'corruption', 'soldiers', 'American', 'Stone', 'crippling', 'weakness', 'sensationalism', 'evidence', 'JFK', 'seeped', 'here', 'instance', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'worst', 'atrocities', 'even', 'are', 'factual', 'question', 'then', 'portray', 'representative', 'typical', 'company', 'soldiers', 'Vietnam', 'experience', 'was', 'impression', 'given', 'fact', 'was', 'basically', 'story', 'irresponsible', 'misleading', 'One', 'film', 'few', 'faults', 'bad', 'one.However', 'when', 'considered', 'whole', 'Platoon', 'much', 'commend', 'unfortunate', 'weaknesses', 'diminish', 'merit', 'do', 'not', 'ruin', ""'d"", 'be', 'very', 'surprised', 'Stone', 'ever', 'movie', 'nearly', 'as', 'good']",N/A

This movie may not be the most accurate on how soldiers did act in the vietnam war, but Stone tried to make the two squads symbolic of the extreme types of attitudes of war.  On one side you had Elias' squad which was much more into making the best out of a bad situation and used drugs as an escape from the reality of war.  Barnes squad was so immersed in war that they would do anything they thought would win the war for America.  Because of a weak Lt. that did not take an active role in leading the squads, Barnes was able to take control of the platoon and divide it by his attitude towards war.  Other notable performances were by Kevin Dillon who played Bunny.  Bunny showed us what happpens when someone is given lots of power and no one to tell him that he is doing something wrong.  A good example is when he kills the kid from the village for no real reason.  I liked this movie because it was more than just battles, it took you inside the minds of the people who were living through a war that they did not understand and were not sure what they were supposed to do.

Gittins,"[1, 2]","I've only given 5 stars to a handful of films, but Platoon deserves it.I never served in war, so how real Stone's depiction of the Vietnam war is I can't say. However, comments in the commentaries (where else?) indicate that though most vets might quibble with minor details, they give high marks to the authenticity and verisimilitude. It is pretty scary when you are 6 feet in front of an enemy bunker but do not see it.As with all Oliver Stone movies, there is some blur between fact and fiction, but he was in Vietnam, so I can only assume he knows what he is talking about. Made on a budget of only 6 million, Stone manages to lead his platoon of actors through an ensemble performance that would capture oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Editing, and Sound, plus nominations for Best Supporting Actor for Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger. Other unknown or rising stars (including Johny Depp, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon, Mark Moses) were excellent as well.Some unforgettable images and scenes, least of which is the one on the DVD cover (which was the main movie poster, too). In Stone's commentary, he says he might have &quot;gotten a little operatic&quot; with Samuel Barber's &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; in this scene. I beg to differ - this is the best music/visual combo in film, although some of &quot;Apocalypse, Now&quot; is close. This piece of music has been used in tons of films, but never more emotionally than here.Some might say the ending narration is a bit sappy - but I think it made the film - and certainly it is an honest evaluation of an unreal situation by a young kid who really has seen it all.Besides a 5-star movie, there are two insightful commentaries (Stone, and technical adviser Dale Dye), and good behind-the-scenes series of cast comments.Highly recommended.",5,I don't give 5 stars often,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,1808,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'handful', 'films', 'Platoon', 'it.I', 'never', 'served', 'war', 'how', 'real', 'Stone', 'depiction', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'However', 'comments', 'commentaries', 'where', 'else', 'indicate', 'most', 'vets', 'might', 'quibble', 'minor', 'details', 'give', 'high', 'marks', 'authenticity', 'verisimilitude', 'pretty', 'scary', 'when', 'are', '6', 'feet', 'front', 'enemy', 'bunker', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'it.As', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'movies', 'blur', 'fact', 'fiction', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'what', 'talking', 'Made', 'budget', 'only', '6', 'million', 'Stone', 'lead', 'platoon', 'actors', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'would', 'capture', 'oscars', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Editing', 'Sound', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Other', 'unknown', 'rising', 'stars', 'including', 'Johny', 'Depp', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'Mark', 'Moses', 'were', 'excellent', 'well.Some', 'unforgettable', 'images', 'scenes', 'least', 'one', 'DVD', 'cover', 'was', 'main', 'movie', 'poster', 'too', 'Stone', 'commentary', 'might', 'have', 'quot', 'gotten', 'little', 'operatic', 'quot', 'Samuel', 'Barber', 'quot', 'Adagio', 'Strings', 'quot', 'scene', 'beg', 'differ', 'best', 'music/visual', 'combo', 'film', 'quot', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'quot', 'close', 'piece', 'music', 'been', 'used', 'tons', 'films', 'never', 'more', 'emotionally', 'here.Some', 'might', 'say', 'ending', 'narration', 'bit', 'sappy', 'think', 'made', 'film', 'certainly', 'honest', 'evaluation', 'unreal', 'situation', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'really', 'seen', '5-star', 'movie', 'are', 'two', 'insightful', 'commentaries', 'Stone', 'technical', 'adviser', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'good', 'behind-the-scenes', 'series', 'cast', 'comments.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

152451,A2Q07KQAAFWVL7,0792845129,Kristoffer Infante,"[2, 3]","Don't they all say that? Yes, war is hell. If you want to see another film that deals with &quot;hell on earth,&quot; go see APOCALYPSE NOW! However, PLATOON is much more than your average war pic. It is an examination of good vs. evil within the ranks of your platoon, an examination of a soldier's journey through life in war, and the hell that was the Vietnam War.This is director Oliver Stone's first venture in Vietnam territory. (He'd follow it up with 1989's BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY and 1993's HEAVEN AND EARTH.) But this film is supposedly different from the other Vietnam films (such as the prejudiced 1967 film THE GREEN BERETS); since Stone, himself, fought in the war! He has gone on to say that Charlie Sheen's character, Chris Taylor, was based on himself. A privileged young man who forgoes college and join the army to fight in this brutal war.Charlie Sheen has the difficult task of bringing us, the audience, into his world of death, dope, bullets, and a fraternity he never wanted to belong to. Assisting in his efforts are two talented men, both nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1986: Tom Berenger, as the psychotic Staff-Sergeant Barnes; and Willem Dafoe, as good-guy Sergeant Elias. Both men are the glue and the driving force in this film; both are the good (Elias) and evil (Barnes) in Chris's world. Both are his &quot;surrogate fathers,&quot; as most people put it.Rounding out the rest of the cast in a variety of ethnic people: Kevin Dillon, brother of Matt Dillon, is the baby-faced, gong-ho killer Bunny. Francesco Quinn, son of Oscar-winner Anthony Quinn, as the gravel-voiced Rhah; Richard Edson as Sal; David Neidorf as Tex; John C. McGinley as the fast-talking, Sammy Davis Jr. impressionist, Sgt. O'Neill; Mark Moses as the wimpy Lt. Wolfe; Chris Pedersen as the hollow Crawford; and Johnny Depp, in one of his early film roles, as the quiet translator Lerner. The black cast consists of: Forest Whitaker as the kind Big Harold; Reggie Johnson as the annoying Junior (who you just want to strangle!); Tony Todd as Warren; and Keith David as the fun-loving King. Also, look for a cameo of director Stone. (I won't tell you where, but it's shocking!) Also of retired U.S.M.C captain Dale Dye as Captain Harris.Despite all the madness going around, there are plenty of moments where you find yourself smiling. For example, when half the group (i.e. Taylor, King, Rhah, Big Harold, Crawford, and Elias) are listening to Smokey Robinson while smoking pot, you can't help but sing along with them and imagine being there with them, dancing their fruity dance. Meanwhile, the other half (i.e. Barnes, Bunny, Junior [?], Lerner, Tex, Sal, O'Neill, and other unknown soldiers) are listening to red-neck music while playing a good game of cards.Winner of 4 Academy Awards including: Best Picture - Arnold Kopelson, producer; Best Director - Oliver Stone; Best Film Editing; and Best Sound. This film is both moving and haunting. Nothing on earth could prepare the soldiers of what was to come.Since then, there have been other films about Vietnam, such as 1987's HAMBURGER HILL and FULL METAL JACKET! I'll even admit, this film also inspired me to make my future Oscar-winning film, PRISONER OF WAR!

The downward spiral in this instance begins the moment PFC Taylor steps off the plane, and continues as his first sight of war is seeing bodies being carried away in bags.Throughout the film, Taylor sees atrocities and horrors, and they take their toll on him. The ultimate end to Taylor&#65533;s loss of innocence comes when he succumbs to the enemy within. Taylor kills Barnes, showing that he has completely lost his innocence: the war has changed him completely. It can be said that the first casualty of war is innocence. I believe that the only guaranteed casualty of war is innocence.The film asks many questions, but gives no answers. Why were we in Vietnam? This question is asked from the perspective of the soldiers fighting the war who have been forgotten by the people back home. The physical enemies of the GI are the Vietcong and the NVA. In the film, the enemy is seen as a distant, unknown figure. The GI&#65533;s never would understand their enemy or the reason why they fought.The film is almost like Lord of the Flies in that a bunch of innocent boys end up in a distant land without rules and end up destroying themselves in a terrible world, only to be brought back to civilization later. In the book, the boys broke down a cried when they saw their first adult in weeks. The crying came from realizing what they had done while they were caught up in the life they were leading. I expect that the same thing happened to Taylor after the film stopped rolling. He would have looked out across the land and thought about what had happened to him. He would have cried, knowing what he had done was only acceptable in times of war. He would have cried knowing that his life would never again be the same.This was a good film. I came into the film with no expectations, which is probably why I was not disappointed.

The other reviewers have summarized the plot well, so I'll just add some observations.The first time I saw it,  I was blown away by the visceral impact of the action&#8212;not only in the battle sequences, but in terms of actually being incountry. Suffering from lack of sleep, eating crap rations, marching while humping heavy loads in the heat, humidity, rains; dealing with insects and snakes- compounded by the frustration of always being so close to an unseen enemy but often unable to engage him are simply mind boggling. Then of course there was the fear: of the unknown, of booby traps,  collateral fire, villagers who may have been innocents or sympathizers&#8212;and the terror of being wounded or killed.The attention to detail, despite some criticism from other reviewers is remarkable. Is all here: the forest, the village and its people, guys jerking off in full view,  misdirected friendly fire,  the underground tunnels of the Viet Cong,  and in one stunning sequence, as the men get ready to walk out into the field at dusk after they get the order to lock and load, a black man raising his voice in an almost spiritual rendition of O Susanna. There are also self inflicted wounds, racism, cruelty, a lieutenant who is unable to lead, ideological schisms about how to win the war or even if the war is worth fighting, along with malice and murder.What impressed me, and it is rare in American cinema, was to finally see black men portrayed as regular people -not comic relief, kindly helpers, martyrs, victims, criminals or elegant supermen ala Sidney Poitier.  The characterizations are stunning in their ordinariness: fast talking black power supporter Junior, young and frightened Francis, bodybuilding party guy Manny, sweet talking Big Hal, heroin addicted Warren, ready to turn a blind eye to moral issues just to survive, &#8211; and for me always at  the heart of the movie-the wonderful Keith David as the uneducated but incredibly wise and generous King, who, delineating the chasm between black and white, rich and poor,  tells the narrator, 'Who ever said we counted for anything? All you have to do is get out of here alive, and the rest of your life will be gravy.'The white guys are no less wonderfully drawn: pragmatic Rhah, brown nosing O'Neill, easy going surfer Crawford, psychotic Bunny, the completely inept Lieutenant  Wolfe, the translator, Lerner,  the kindly medic who is appalled by violence, and the young man who narrates the story, Chris, a college kid from a well-to -do family who has volunteered for duty. But make no mistake-these aren't types like we saw in most WWII Hollywood fare&#8212;but multifaceted and surprising human beings.In a sense the story revolves around Chris [ Charlie Sheen] and the two pivotal characters who will influence and define his maturity: the humane, thoughtful and individualistic Sergeant Elias [ Willem Dafoe] and Sergeant Barnes [ Tom Berenger], the brutal realist who effectively runs the platoon and knows what it takes to keep the men alive and functioning as a unit. In the course of the story, Chris will choose his side, though he will also for better or worse incorporate the characteristics of both men.Berenger and Dafoe  give outstanding performances as does Keith David&#8212;and I think the then young Charlie Sheen was a wonderful choice for Chris. Not only does he look like a stand in for Oliver Stone but the casting nods to his father, Martin Sheen, who was the lead in Apocalypse Now.  And if you are impressed at all with Dafoe, watch Stone's Born on the 4th of July where Dafoe gives one of his greatest performances as the embittered and  disabled veteran, Charlie from Chicago.",5,Stunning characterizations,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,4250,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'normal', 'woman', 'who', 'shoes', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'Platoon', 'premier', 'remained', 'one', 'favorites.Setting', 'aside', 'real', 'life', 'moral', 'political', 'considerations', 'perhaps', 'veracity', 'minor', 'details', 'find', 'none', 'other', 'artistic', 'forays', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'realistic', 'forceful', 'Platoon', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'actually', 'served', 'war', '[', 'distinction', ']', '1967-68', '25th', 'infantry', 'then', 'First', 'Cavalry', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'summarized', 'plot', 'well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'add', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'visceral', 'impact', 'action', '8212', 'not', 'only', 'battle', 'sequences', 'terms', 'actually', 'being', 'incountry', 'Suffering', 'lack', 'sleep', 'eating', 'crap', 'rations', 'marching', 'humping', 'heavy', 'loads', 'heat', 'humidity', 'dealing', 'insects', 'snakes-', 'compounded', 'frustration', 'always', 'being', 'so', 'close', 'unseen', 'enemy', 'often', 'unable', 'engage', 'are', 'simply', 'mind', 'boggling', 'Then', 'course', 'was', 'fear', 'unknown', 'booby', 'traps', 'collateral', 'fire', 'villagers', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'innocents', 'sympathizers', '8212', 'terror', 'being', 'wounded', 'killed.The', 'attention', 'detail', 'criticism', 'other', 'reviewers', 'remarkable', 'here', 'forest', 'village', 'people', 'guys', 'jerking', 'off', 'full', 'view', 'misdirected', 'friendly', 'fire', 'underground', 'tunnels', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'one', 'stunning', 'sequence', 'men', 'get', 'ready', 'walk', 'out', 'field', 'dusk', 'get', 'order', 'lock', 'load', 'black', 'man', 'raising', 'voice', 'almost', 'spiritual', 'rendition', 'O', 'Susanna', 'are', 'also', 'self', 'inflicted', 'wounds', 'racism', 'cruelty', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'unable', 'lead', 'ideological', 'schisms', 'how', 'win', 'war', 'even', 'war', 'worth', 'fighting', 'malice', 'murder.What', 'impressed', 'rare', 'American', 'cinema', 'was', 'finally', 'see', 'black', 'men', 'portrayed', 'regular', 'people', '-not', 'comic', 'relief', 'kindly', 'helpers', 'martyrs', 'victims', 'criminals', 'elegant', 'supermen', 'ala', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'characterizations', 'are', 'stunning', 'ordinariness', 'fast', 'talking', 'black', 'power', 'supporter', 'Junior', 'young', 'frightened', 'Francis', 'bodybuilding', 'party', 'guy', 'Manny', 'sweet', 'talking', 'Big', 'Hal', 'heroin', 'addicted', 'Warren', 'ready', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'moral', 'issues', 'just', 'survive', '8211', 'always', 'heart', 'movie-the', 'wonderful', 'Keith', 'David', 'uneducated', 'incredibly', 'wise', 'generous', 'King', 'who', 'delineating', 'chasm', 'black', 'white', 'rich', 'poor', 'narrator', 'ever', 'said', 'counted', 'anything', 'have', 'do', 'get', 'here', 'alive', 'rest', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'gravy', 'white', 'guys', 'are', 'less', 'wonderfully', 'drawn', 'pragmatic', 'Rhah', 'nosing', ""O'Neill"", 'easy', 'going', 'surfer', 'Crawford', 'psychotic', 'Bunny', 'completely', 'inept', 'Lieutenant', 'Wolfe', 'translator', 'Lerner', 'kindly', 'medic', 'who', 'appalled', 'violence', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'story', 'Chris', 'college', 'kid', 'well-to', '-do', 'family', 'who', 'volunteered', 'duty', 'make', 'mistake-these', 'are', ""n't"", 'types', 'saw', 'most', 'WWII', 'Hollywood', 'fare', '8212', 'multifaceted', 'surprising', 'human', 'beings.In', 'sense', 'story', 'Chris', '[', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', ']', 'two', 'pivotal', 'characters', 'who', 'will', 'influence', 'define', 'maturity', 'humane', 'thoughtful', 'individualistic', 'Sergeant', 'Elias', '[', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', ']', 'Sergeant', 'Barnes', '[', 'Tom', 'Berenger', ']', 'brutal', 'realist', 'who', 'effectively', 'platoon', 'what', 'keep', 'men', 'alive', 'functioning', 'unit', 'course', 'story', 'Chris', 'will', 'choose', 'side', 'will', 'also', 'better', 'worse', 'incorporate', 'characteristics', 'men.Berenger', 'Dafoe', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Keith', 'David', '8212', 'think', 'then', 'young', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'was', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'Chris', 'Not', 'only', 'look', 'stand', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'casting', 'nods', 'father', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'who', 'was', 'lead', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'are', 'impressed', 'Dafoe', 'watch', 'Stone', 'Born', '4th', 'July', 'where', 'Dafoe', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'embittered', 'disabled', 'veteran', 'Charlie', 'Chicago']",N/A
152458,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0792845129,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 5]","This 1986 Academy Award winning film is based on writer/director Oliver Stone's experiences in Vietnam.  It's raw and gritty.  And it doesn't preach.  It just shows in living color what war was like for a specific platoon.  Basically, it was about trying to survive and just get through it all.Charlie Sheen stars as the raw recruit. At first we see him as the young boy who wrote daily to his grandmother about the bugs and the blisters and the constant fatigue.  Later, we see join the camaraderie of the platoon.  And still later, we watch him make some hard choices of his own.  Tom Berenger is cast as the scar-faced sergeant with the kind of cruel streak that doesn't stop at murder.  And Willem Dafoe is cast as an equally experienced soldier who deplores the cruelty and is willing to stand up for his views.The film focuses only on the experience in the jungle.  There are no flashbacks to childhood or stateside relations.  There is no mention of the anti-war movement or the plans of the generals.  It is all about just humping through the jungle, in constant fear for their lives and lots of macho swaggering to keep up their courage.  There are constant ambushes, horrible injuries, lots of death.  But the most awful scene of all is when the platoon, overtired and angry because of recent horrific casualties, goes into a village.  Here, all the pent up emotion is unleashed on the innocent villagers.  This is the moral center of the film, where there are choices between right and wrong.  Here is the part of the film where I burst into tears myself.  War sure is ugly.This is a great film and it makes most the other war films I've seen pale by comparison.  I give it my highest recommendation.The film brought me right into reality of what its like for the soldiers fearing for their lives and the civilians who happen to get in their way.

We have the older and younger Sheen, both playing protagonists who immerse themselves in the convoluted morals of the war and come out changed. In Platoon, well worthy of its #83 in the AFI Top 100 listing, Charlie Sheen is a volunteer who goes into the Vietnam War with high ethics. He feels he must do his part to support his country. After a short while he realizes just what he has gotten himself into.While some movies about Vietnam almost feel like the spoof Tropic Thunder, here we have a view as seen by people who had been there. Charlie is pitted between two veterans - Berenger and Dafoe - one dark and brutal, the other a ""crusader"" who still believes in doing the right thing. I've seen this movie numerous times and every time I get swept up in the emotion of the events, the pain and chaos and despair felt by the men.It's no wonder veterans of war come back with traumas to their psyche even if their bodies are untouched. To see these kinds of things, and have to make these kinds of choices, has got to affect your mind.Certainly Platoon is about one specific war, but its underlying tale is about any conflict, faced by people of any nation, of any color, male and female. Anybody who heads into Iraq, into Afghanistan, into any other conflict zone, knows what this is about. They know the life or death decisions that have to be made. They feel the pain of calling an airstrike in on your own position.Absolutely a must watch movie, and one to revisit as you go on through life. Each viewing, at each stage, brings you fresh insight into the challenges faced.If I am going to have any complaint at all, it is that it praises the ""men"" of the Vietnam war, and not a single female is seen throughout the entire movie, besides the Vietnamese woman who is raped and the villager who is shot. There were many women who served in Vietnam. It would be one thing if we had just as many movies that were all-female. But we don't. We only have movies that are all-male, and then movies which are mostly-male, in the AFI top 100. If it were one or two all-male movies, that would be one thing. But to see movie after movie after movie that are 100% male makes me start to wonder what the male directors think of our world.",5,A Must-See,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,2355,"['amazing', 'watch', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Platoon', 'back', 'back', 'see', 'views', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'separated', 'decade', 'have', 'older', 'younger', 'Sheen', 'playing', 'protagonists', 'who', 'immerse', 'convoluted', 'morals', 'war', 'come', 'out', 'changed', 'Platoon', 'well', 'worthy', '83', 'AFI', 'Top', '100', 'listing', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'volunteer', 'who', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'high', 'ethics', 'must', 'do', 'part', 'support', 'country', 'short', 'just', 'what', 'gotten', 'movies', 'Vietnam', 'almost', 'feel', 'spoof', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'here', 'have', 'view', 'seen', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'Charlie', 'pitted', 'two', 'veterans', 'Berenger', 'Dafoe', 'one', 'dark', 'brutal', 'other', 'crusader', 'who', 'still', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'numerous', 'times', 'time', 'get', 'swept', 'up', 'emotion', 'events', 'pain', 'chaos', 'despair', 'felt', 'men.It', 'wonder', 'veterans', 'war', 'come', 'back', 'traumas', 'psyche', 'even', 'bodies', 'are', 'untouched', 'see', 'kinds', 'things', 'have', 'make', 'kinds', 'choices', 'got', 'affect', 'mind.Certainly', 'Platoon', 'one', 'specific', 'war', 'underlying', 'tale', 'conflict', 'faced', 'people', 'nation', 'color', 'male', 'female', 'Anybody', 'who', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'other', 'conflict', 'zone', 'what', 'about', 'know', 'life', 'death', 'decisions', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'feel', 'pain', 'calling', 'airstrike', 'own', 'position.Absolutely', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'revisit', 'go', 'life', 'viewing', 'stage', 'fresh', 'insight', 'challenges', 'faced.If', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'complaint', 'men', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'not', 'single', 'female', 'seen', 'entire', 'movie', 'Vietnamese', 'woman', 'who', 'raped', 'villager', 'who', 'shot', 'were', 'many', 'women', 'who', 'served', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'movies', 'were', 'all-female', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'have', 'movies', 'are', 'all-male', 'then', 'movies', 'are', 'mostly-male', 'AFI', 'top', '100', 'were', 'one', 'two', 'all-male', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'see', 'movie', 'movie', 'movie', 'are', '100', '%', 'male', 'start', 'wonder', 'what', 'male', 'directors', 'think', 'world']",N/A

But then again, with characters that simplistic and underdeveloped, the actors didn't have much to work with. For example, Charlie Sheen's character Chris states that he dropped out of college and enlisted because he felt it unjust that only the poor were forced to fight. That's it. No development, no further reinforcement or motivation, no illustration of how he was raised in a moral family. The viewer is just to take his word. I'm sorry, but flat characters with underdeveloped motivations are a sign of a poor script. (Oh, for those of you used to Oliver Stone movies, let me hold your hand: poor script=poor movie).Moreover, the contrast between the ""good"" sergeant and the ""bad"" sergeant are childishly simplistic--hell, Stone should have given Dafoe a white hat and Berenger a black one and spared us the hackneyed dialogue. The musical score is too melodramatic, and he depicts the Vietnamese as, for the most part, faceless killers. In short, Stone's PLATOON is insultingly manipulative in a cheap, didactic way. Wait a minute, that sounds like EVERY  Stone movie.Two redeeming qualities: the ""do the village"" scene is quite good, simply because its the only well-executed psychological examination of the soldiers and it more even-handedly portrays the Vietnamese; also, Stone does an excellent job portraying life as a grunt. Any vets out there, I thank you. Sure, there are a lot of explosions and intense fighting scenes, but that does not make a good movie, let alone a good war film.

In my mind &quot;Platoon&quot; changed that and films since from &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; to &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; have portrayed combat in a way that no sane person would want to experience voluntarily.But if Platoon were only a collection of realistically staged film battles it would have been boring.  The heart of the film is it's story and characters.  Charlie Sheen gives his best film performance as new recruit Chris Taylor, a rich kid who passes on his opportunity to go to college instead of Vietnam because he doesn't think that only the poor kids should have to fight.

Willem Dafoe is Sgt Elias, who smokes dope back at camp, but in the field is quick on his feet, witty and wise, and compassionate to his fellow man.  Tom Berenger goes against his &quot;pretty boy&quot; image and plays Staff Sgt Barnes, a crusty old combat veteran with the scars of many previous battles on his face.  Back in camp Barnes' drug of choice is whiskey, and in the field Barnes believes the ends justifies the means. Tom Moses plays Lieutenant Wolfe as a young fresh-faced officer who has no real connection with his men and is completely dependent on the leadership and decisions of his experienced Sergeants.  Other platoon members are brought to life by gifted young actors like Forest Whitaker, John McGinley, Keith David and Johnny Depp.The central conflict of the film comes with the platoon is out on patrol and discovers one of their members brutally murdered.  They come to a small thatched village where there seems to be evidence that these terrified Vietnamese peasants may have harbored or even actively helped the enemy responsible for the murder of their fellow soldier.  Barnes, and the soldiers loyal to him, want to take their revenge on the whole village.  Elias is more level-headed and believe that many of these peasants had nothing to do with it.  This scene escalates in violence and intensity until Elias barely reigns in the men, and the hate and distrust that erupts between Elias and Barnes colors the rest of the movie.The film ends with a virtuoso sequence in which the Platoon entrenches themselves in the face of a vastly larger advancing North Vietnamese force.  Another Platoon is entrenched in front of them, and we see the growing hysteria among the platoon as the forward platoon is overrun and annihilated by the Vietnamese forces.Oliver Stone's movie takes place among the common soldiers and all of the politics of the Vietnam War occur somewhere else.This movie is as close as I ever want to be to a foxhole with an armed enemy coming towards me.",5,Oliver Stone's Masterpiece: Vietnam - You are there,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,2848,"['War', 'Movies', 'used', 'portray', 'heroic', 'characters', 'who', 'bravely', 'blew', 'away', 'enemy', 'combat', 'came', 'screen', 'looking', 'almost', 'antiseptically', 'bloodless', 'mind', 'quot', 'Platoon', 'quot', 'changed', 'films', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'quot', 'quot', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'quot', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'have', 'portrayed', 'combat', 'way', 'sane', 'person', 'would', 'want', 'experience', 'voluntarily.But', 'Platoon', 'were', 'only', 'collection', 'realistically', 'staged', 'film', 'battles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'boring', 'heart', 'film', 'story', 'characters', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'best', 'film', 'performance', 'new', 'recruit', 'Chris', 'Taylor', 'rich', 'kid', 'who', 'opportunity', 'go', 'college', 'instead', 'Vietnam', ""n't"", 'think', 'only', 'poor', 'kids', 'should', 'have', 'fight', 'Chris', 'platoon', 'led', 'two', 'sergeants', 'who', 'are', 'wildly', 'different', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Sgt', 'Elias', 'who', 'dope', 'back', 'camp', 'field', 'quick', 'feet', 'witty', 'wise', 'compassionate', 'fellow', 'man', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'quot', 'boy', 'quot', 'image', 'plays', 'Staff', 'Sgt', 'Barnes', 'crusty', 'old', 'combat', 'veteran', 'scars', 'many', 'previous', 'battles', 'face', 'Back', 'camp', 'Barnes', 'drug', 'choice', 'whiskey', 'field', 'Barnes', 'ends', 'means', 'Tom', 'Moses', 'Lieutenant', 'Wolfe', 'young', 'fresh-faced', 'officer', 'who', 'real', 'connection', 'men', 'completely', 'dependent', 'leadership', 'decisions', 'experienced', 'Sergeants', 'Other', 'platoon', 'members', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'gifted', 'young', 'actors', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'John', 'McGinley', 'Keith', 'David', 'Johnny', 'Depp.The', 'central', 'conflict', 'film', 'platoon', 'out', 'patrol', 'one', 'members', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'come', 'small', 'thatched', 'village', 'where', 'there', 'be', 'evidence', 'terrified', 'Vietnamese', 'peasants', 'may', 'have', 'harbored', 'even', 'actively', 'helped', 'enemy', 'responsible', 'murder', 'fellow', 'soldier', 'Barnes', 'soldiers', 'loyal', 'want', 'take', 'revenge', 'whole', 'village', 'Elias', 'more', 'level-headed', 'believe', 'many', 'peasants', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'scene', 'violence', 'intensity', 'Elias', 'barely', 'men', 'hate', 'distrust', 'Elias', 'Barnes', 'colors', 'rest', 'movie.The', 'film', 'virtuoso', 'sequence', 'Platoon', 'face', 'vastly', 'larger', 'advancing', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'force', 'Platoon', 'entrenched', 'front', 'see', 'growing', 'hysteria', 'platoon', 'forward', 'platoon', 'overrun', 'annihilated', 'Vietnamese', 'forces.Oliver', 'Stone', 'movie', 'place', 'common', 'soldiers', 'politics', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'occur', 'somewhere', 'else.This', 'movie', 'as', 'close', 'ever', 'want', 'be', 'foxhole', 'armed', 'enemy', 'coming', 'towards']",N/A

Tom Berenger and Willem Dafore play Sgt. Barnes and Sgt. Elias, two of Sheens supervisors whose personal conflicts start to tear the platoon apart. This is a classic movie that the viewer will want to watch over and over again. With the DVD we also get a behind the scenes documentary on how the actors were selected and the grueling training they went through to get ready for the film.

I'll reserve the balance of my time for a few remarks about the Special Edition DVD...If you love this film it's imperative that you get the ""Special Edition""--it's well worth the few bucks extra.  The hour-long Documentary ""Tour of the Inferno"" is truly spectacular and contains extensive interviews with Stone, Defoe, Berenger, Sheen, et al, describing the ""method direction"" Stone employed to create an atmosphere of reality unparalleled in other war films.  By method direction, I'm referring to the boot camp experience Stone and Dale Dye employed to cultivate a sense of the psychosis felt by those who served in the Nam, and impart that sense to the actors who were to portray very tangible characters drawn from Stone's own Vietnam experience as an infantryman.While listening to Stone's commentary I finally found the answer to a question about Platoon that had dogged me for years.  In the scene after Barnes is killed, Chris is sitting down and is discovered by US soldiers followed by an American tank flying a Nazi swastika flag.  I never understood this and scoured the Internet looking for an answer.  In the commentary, Stone explains that the APC units were very extreme and used to adorn themselves with Nazi regalia[?].Although some DVD's contain a lot of extras that simply aren't worth the effort, this is not the case with the Special Edition of Platoon.

152468,A1Y87E22UVYCE6,0792845129,"Maximiliano F Yofre ""Maxi""","[7, 9]","Oliver Stone is a very opinionated and controversial director. Just taking a look to some of his films is more than enough: ""Salvador"" (1986), ""Born 4th July"" (1989) and ""JFK"" (1991). ""Platoon"" (1986) is not an exception to this rule. Nevertheless, whatever your opinion may be, this film will not leave you unmoved.In my opinion is the most realistic and insightful film done on Vietnam War.Why do I think so? Well first of all it directly shows a taboo subject as ""fragging"" (killing or trying to kill your war mates). Second it shows drug consuming: the direct and side effects on the front line troops. Third it shows the abuse on civilian Vietnamese population. Last but not least a very straightforward description of front line life: sentinels going asleep and letting others to be blamed; NCO rivalry amongst themselves and with the junior officers; racial and social tension; nothing is omitted.The storyline follows Pvt. Chris Taylor, a just arrived volunteer, from tenderfoot to veteran. His hard growing up: as a man and as a soldier; his ethical decisions; his moral dilemmas; you can easily see all is ""the real thing"". It is no surprise as Stone is Nam Veteran.Every actor, from main character to supporting roles, gives a top notch performance: Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Forest Withaker, Francesco Quinn, John McGinley, Kevin Dillon you name it.Photography by Robert Richardson ( a usual Stone's collaborator) is very good.A word for the final battle: superlative realism and great action cinematography.A film recommended for everyone that wants to have a sight of what war really is and a realistic, if controversial, account of Vietnam War.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,War as it was.,1099353600,"11 2, 2004",2004,1698,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'very', 'opinionated', 'controversial', 'director', 'Just', 'taking', 'look', 'films', 'more', 'enough', 'Salvador', '1986', 'Born', '4th', 'July', '1989', 'JFK', '1991', 'Platoon', '1986', 'not', 'exception', 'rule', 'Nevertheless', 'opinion', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'unmoved.In', 'opinion', 'most', 'realistic', 'insightful', 'film', 'done', 'Vietnam', 'War.Why', 'do', 'think', 'so', 'Well', 'first', 'directly', 'taboo', 'subject', 'fragging', 'killing', 'trying', 'kill', 'war', 'mates', 'Second', 'drug', 'consuming', 'direct', 'side', 'effects', 'front', 'line', 'troops', 'Third', 'abuse', 'civilian', 'Vietnamese', 'population', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'very', 'straightforward', 'description', 'front', 'line', 'life', 'sentinels', 'going', 'asleep', 'letting', 'others', 'be', 'blamed', 'NCO', 'rivalry', 'amongst', 'junior', 'officers', 'racial', 'social', 'tension', 'nothing', 'omitted.The', 'storyline', 'Pvt', 'Chris', 'Taylor', 'just', 'arrived', 'volunteer', 'tenderfoot', 'veteran', 'hard', 'growing', 'up', 'man', 'soldier', 'ethical', 'decisions', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'real', 'thing', 'surprise', 'Stone', 'Nam', 'Veteran.Every', 'actor', 'main', 'character', 'supporting', 'roles', 'top', 'notch', 'performance', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Forest', 'Withaker', 'Francesco', 'Quinn', 'John', 'McGinley', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'name', 'it.Photography', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'usual', 'Stone', 'collaborator', 'very', 'good.A', 'word', 'final', 'battle', 'superlative', 'realism', 'great', 'action', 'cinematography.A', 'film', 'recommended', 'everyone', 'have', 'sight', 'what', 'war', 'really', 'realistic', 'controversial', 'account', 'Vietnam', 'War.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

152472,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0792845129,Michael Crane,"[19, 26]","A daring, emotionally charged, and powerful war movie that breaks down all the rules and boundaries, ""Platoon"" is a film like no other.  The first time I watched this was a few years ago, and it must've been on a day where I wasn't really focusing on it.  Well, I gave it another shot and it was like seeing it for the very first time.  It was like I had never seen the movie before.  ""Platoon"" is an emotional experience you don't want to miss out on.Inspired by his involvement in the Vietnam War, writer and director Oliver Stone paints an honest and brutal movie about the terrible war.  There are no lonesome heroes, there are no wham-bam shoot-em up scenes, and there is not a single moment in this film that makes you think of war as glamorous.  The movie paints war as it is; absolute Hell.  Tom Berenger, William Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, and many other famous names star in this fantastic and heart-breaking film, and give those like me who have never seen war a horrifying picture.  I believe this was one of the first war movies that didn't just show you soldiers, but those soldiers actually are; human-beings.Oliver Stone executes the movie with so much authenticity and care.  If this movie were done by anybody else who had NOT been in the Vietnam War, this would be a completely different movie.  I believe that he was very honest in his own portrayal of what he saw and experienced.  He makes you see these soldiers not as soldiers, but as real human-beings.  Human-beings who feel pain and can break down, as you see many of them do in the movie.  I think he did a spectacular job of orchestrating it all.The actors were great too.  There were so many that I can't get into them all, but I will get to the major players.  William Dafoe is brilliant in his role, as usual.  Tom Berenger is mean as hell and as cold as they come.  There is NO WAY anybody else could've played the part.  And Charlie Sheen did a outstanding job as the nave and emotionally-broken down soldier who you know is going to explode at any minute.  Everybody was great in their roles, is what it all comes down to.This DVD edition is pretty neat, although for a movie of this magnitude it would've been nice to have a 2-disk edition.  Still, what you do get is nothing lacking.  The picture and sound quality has been restored which is a big improvement over the very first version that came out.  There are cool special features such as commentaries, an outstanding documentary, the theatrical trailer and TV spots, and a photo gallery.  All of them really do enrich the movie and I'm glad they were included.A while back I said that I thought ""Black Hawk Down"" was the best war movie I had ever seen.  Mainly because there wasn't supposed to be a plot or character development, it just reported exactly what went down on that day.  But now, I'm going to have to change my opinion on that.  I now think that ""Platoon"" is by far the best war movie I have ever seen, and I have a feeling it will be the best war movie that I ever will see.  It's going to be hard to top it, no doubt about it.  If you haven't given this spectacular and honest film a chance, by all means go out to the nearest video store by you and pick up a copy.  ""Platoon"" is one of those movies I think everyone should see at some point in their lives.  It's an important, emotional, powerful, and gripping film.

I've seen about 5 times on dvd and on my mp3 player but what I really got out of it this time was how draining it was on me. It seemed like it was 4 hours long. It just has this 'death' feeling written all over it.. but dont get me wrong it's a very good film and in my top 10 no doubt.I think a gut-wrenchingly depressing film is good for the soul. Most people would rather not have death lingering over their heads but there is a reason that 91% of people enjoyed it (on rotten tomatoes) and that's because it's a good film. This movie does have a little bit of comedy to get you through if depressing isn't your thing. But its not a war/comedy, it's definitely a war film.About the transfer:One thing I noticed on the blu ray was the sound.

Oliver Stone is a very good Director. His early movies like Platoon and Wall Street were great. Unfortunately, in his later films he began to sermonize, twisting plots around unnaturally to make a political statement. Spike Lee also shared this same fault. Brilliant early movies (Do the Right Thing)were followed up by this need to sermonize which distracts us from important stories. Here in Platoon though it's just great story telling. We are introduced to Vietnam through Chris Taylor's eyes(Charlie Sheen).Taylor is an educated young man from an affluent family who volunteered. He offers poignant observations about the war in the form of letters he writes to his family. Through his eyes we realize that Vietnam is a deadly & surreal world. He sees this immediately upon arrival when he is confronted with the image of body bags being loaded onto the plane he just stepped off.  Barely given time to acclimate he quickly finds himself in a small unit patrolling the jungle at night. That's where he comes under the intense no nonsense command of Sgt. Barnes(Tom Berenger). Later he will come across the more likable and compassionate Sgt. Elias(Willem Dafoe). The battle sequences in the jungle are frenetic & chaotic- brief flourishes of heightened noise and light followed just as quickly with the enemy disappearing back into the jungle. They seem quite realistic to me(I did not serve in Vietnam so I am not an expert on this). Also worth mentioning is a brief but brilliant role played by Dale Dye. Dye was himself a decorated Officer in Vietnam(USMC)and served as technical adviser for the movie. Director Stone was wise to actually give him a part. In a small but noteworthy performance he plays Captain Harris - the first in a long string of military roles for Dye(Casualty of War, Saving Private Ryan, Under Seige among others).There is a social dynamic that is noticeable. Private Taylor's platoon is full of interesting and diverse individuals shaped by the turbulent times. We see young men who were drafted because there family didn't have the means to sequester their sons away in college. Beyond that main similarity the platoon will be split into various subgroups and cliques; blacks, hispanics, country boys, city boys, whites who have no issue socializing, smoking marijuana with their black comrades and whites who come from segregated places in America who would rather not.Halfway through the film the platoon invades a village searching for NVA soldiers who ambushed one of there own. The manner in which they respond to the killing forces the platoon into two different camps - those supporting Sgt. Barnes & those supporting Sgt. Elias. Platoon has many memorable and intense battle sequences and I would put the film in the top 10, possibly top 5 war movies of all time. The movie is accompanied by the extraordinarily sad musical score of Strings by Adagio which is quite fitting since the great loss of men in Vietnam was extraordinarily tragic.",5,Top 10 all time war movie,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,3082,"['one', 'great', 'war', 'movies', 'time', 'Seeing', 'again', 'Blu', 'ray', 'more', 'special', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'very', 'good', 'Director', 'early', 'movies', 'Platoon', 'Wall', 'Street', 'were', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'later', 'films', 'began', 'sermonize', 'twisting', 'plots', 'unnaturally', 'make', 'political', 'statement', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'also', 'shared', 'same', 'fault', 'Brilliant', 'early', 'movies', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'were', 'followed', 'up', 'need', 'sermonize', 'important', 'stories', 'Here', 'Platoon', 'just', 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'are', 'introduced', 'Vietnam', 'Chris', 'Taylor', 'eyes', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', '.Taylor', 'educated', 'young', 'man', 'affluent', 'family', 'who', 'volunteered', 'poignant', 'observations', 'war', 'form', 'letters', 'family', 'eyes', 'realize', 'Vietnam', 'deadly', 'surreal', 'world', 'immediately', 'arrival', 'when', 'confronted', 'image', 'body', 'bags', 'being', 'loaded', 'plane', 'just', 'stepped', 'off', 'Barely', 'given', 'time', 'acclimate', 'quickly', 'small', 'unit', 'patrolling', 'jungle', 'night', 'where', 'intense', 'nonsense', 'command', 'Sgt', 'Barnes', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Later', 'will', 'come', 'more', 'likable', 'compassionate', 'Sgt', 'Elias', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'battle', 'sequences', 'jungle', 'are', 'frenetic', 'chaotic-', 'brief', 'flourishes', 'heightened', 'noise', 'light', 'followed', 'just', 'quickly', 'enemy', 'disappearing', 'back', 'jungle', 'seem', 'quite', 'realistic', 'did', 'not', 'serve', 'Vietnam', 'am', 'not', 'expert', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'brief', 'brilliant', 'role', 'played', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'Dye', 'was', 'decorated', 'Officer', 'Vietnam', 'USMC', 'served', 'technical', 'adviser', 'movie', 'Director', 'Stone', 'was', 'wise', 'actually', 'give', 'part', 'small', 'noteworthy', 'performance', 'Captain', 'Harris', 'first', 'long', 'string', 'military', 'roles', 'Dye', 'Casualty', 'War', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Seige', 'others', 'social', 'dynamic', 'noticeable', 'Private', 'Taylor', 'platoon', 'full', 'interesting', 'diverse', 'individuals', 'shaped', 'turbulent', 'times', 'see', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'drafted', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'means', 'sequester', 'sons', 'away', 'college', 'main', 'similarity', 'platoon', 'will', 'be', 'split', 'various', 'subgroups', 'cliques', 'blacks', 'hispanics', 'country', 'boys', 'city', 'boys', 'whites', 'who', 'have', 'issue', 'socializing', 'smoking', 'marijuana', 'black', 'comrades', 'whites', 'who', 'come', 'segregated', 'places', 'America', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'not.Halfway', 'film', 'platoon', 'village', 'searching', 'NVA', 'soldiers', 'who', 'ambushed', 'one', 'own', 'manner', 'respond', 'killing', 'platoon', 'two', 'different', 'camps', 'supporting', 'Sgt', 'Barnes', 'supporting', 'Sgt', 'Elias', 'Platoon', 'many', 'memorable', 'intense', 'battle', 'sequences', 'would', 'put', 'film', 'top', '10', 'possibly', 'top', '5', 'war', 'movies', 'time', 'movie', 'accompanied', 'extraordinarily', 'sad', 'musical', 'score', 'Strings', 'Adagio', 'quite', 'fitting', 'great', 'loss', 'men', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'tragic']",N/A

The second of the three truly captivating Vietnam films released between 79-87 (Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now are the others, both done by unique directors)  In addition, this film put Stone on the map, and intriguingly enough put another Sheen in the jungle.The story, for those who do not know, takes place around Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a new, well-off volunteer who learns more then his fair share of life in Vietnam.  Specifically, this is because of the division between tough Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) and equally tough, but understanding Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Defoe).As I mentioned, I like a variety of films about Vietnam, but this seems to, through it's own fashion, offer just a bit more about the feeling that was that war.  Admittedly, this film has bits way too reminiscent of Apocalypse Now, but this film diminishes a lot of art for action and with reason.  The reason is because war is not pretty, and Stone knew that and still knows that, thus he added a little more realistic edge.If you feel like you've seen all the Vietnam you can take then this definitely isn't your film.  If you have this halcyon view of the glory days of 'Nam then this probably will not please you either.

The one star is for the functionality of the blu ray disc itself. I have a 32"" Hitachi L32BD304 LCD HDTV Blu Ray 32"" combo. I began watching Platoon in Blu Ray and eventually pressed the STOP button on the remote just after the ambush scene, thinking I would get back to the movie later.When I returned to continue watching the movie, I pressed the PLAY button and got the usual 'pause' as the Blu Ray player 'reves up'. Suddenly on the screen appeared ""Resume Playback?"" with a ""YES"" and a ""No"". I pressed OK to indicate YES, and received the ""Prohibited"" symbol. I pressed PLAY and got the same Prohibited symbol.I tried the right arrow button to choose 'NO', to at least see if that worked. Nothing. It asks me if I want to resume playback, but doesn't respond to any remote commands from any remote control button. It's frozen, in other words. Then, the screen suddenly cycled back to the Blu Ray presentation screen that appears when you insert a blu ray disk, and then again, back to the 'Resume Playback'.  To eject the Platoon Blu Ray disk, I had to unplug my TV power cable.After some quick reading, it appears that many Blu Ray disks have java programming that does not allow resuming a disk to start where it left off when the STOP button is pressed. The movie will start from the beginning.But that is not even the case here. I wasn't even afforded that opportunity. Knowing that the issue is with the disk, I exchanged the Platoon Blu Ray disk for another, but the ""Resume Playback?"" reappears and doesn't go any further, except to re-cycle screens and return to the same ""Resume Playback?"".

The movie seeks to show the various physical and idelogical struggles that moved and shaped the American public during the Vietnam War. The political ideologies; how low-intensity guerilla Cold War conflicts took a toll on public opinion in that protracted conflict; how socio-economic strife such as racism and poverty manifested themselves in the military.The character played by Charlie Sheen is seens as the all American fall-guy: a boy with a naive view about patriotism who volunteers to duty as opposed to being drafted and so becomes a man. His political beliefs are challenged by two opposing platoon sergeants: Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger). The character played by DeFoe has a liking for Sheen's as he sees the same man in him when he first joined the war. Barnes is the opposite; there doesn't need to be a just purpose for him to serve in a war; there just needs to be a war: he does his job so well he actually enjoys it.The conflict between Barnes and Elias seems to reflect the deeper social divisions at home. Barnes symbolizes the conservative establishment demonstrating the view that fighting for your country is reason enough to go to war. Elias is the conscience and voice of wisdom in the film; reflecting the changing public views that the Government going to war is, in and of itself, not good enough of a reason to support a war if it doesn't make sense to the people.By Barnes killing Elias in the end, Stone seeks to show how the war was taken over by war mongers for whom the war was the end in and of itself. Sheen's character comes back as the redeemer whe he finally vindicates Elias and his position on the war.Overall a touching movie more focused on symbolism and imagery than other films such as Kubrick's &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;; not as much as &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; but still more of a poetic vision rather than realistic.",4,A Nostalgic and Symbolic Drama,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,2036,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'critical', 'reflections', 'Platoon', 'are', 'unique', 'moving', 'are', 'more', 'symbolic', 'renditions', 'conflict', 'movie', 'show', 'various', 'physical', 'idelogical', 'struggles', 'moved', 'shaped', 'American', 'public', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'political', 'ideologies', 'how', 'low-intensity', 'guerilla', 'Cold', 'War', 'conflicts', 'took', 'toll', 'public', 'opinion', 'protracted', 'conflict', 'how', 'socio-economic', 'strife', 'such', 'racism', 'poverty', 'manifested', 'military.The', 'character', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'seens', 'American', 'fall-guy', 'boy', 'naive', 'view', 'patriotism', 'who', 'duty', 'opposed', 'being', 'drafted', 'so', 'man', 'political', 'beliefs', 'are', 'challenged', 'two', 'opposing', 'platoon', 'sergeants', 'Sergeant', 'Elias', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Sergeant', 'Barnes', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'character', 'played', 'DeFoe', 'liking', 'Sheen', 'same', 'man', 'when', 'first', 'joined', 'war', 'Barnes', 'opposite', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'just', 'purpose', 'serve', 'war', 'just', 'needs', 'be', 'war', 'job', 'so', 'well', 'actually', 'it.The', 'conflict', 'Barnes', 'Elias', 'reflect', 'deeper', 'social', 'divisions', 'home', 'Barnes', 'conservative', 'establishment', 'demonstrating', 'view', 'fighting', 'country', 'reason', 'enough', 'go', 'war', 'Elias', 'conscience', 'voice', 'wisdom', 'film', 'reflecting', 'changing', 'public', 'views', 'Government', 'going', 'war', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'support', 'war', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'people.By', 'Barnes', 'killing', 'Elias', 'end', 'Stone', 'show', 'how', 'war', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'war', 'mongers', 'whom', 'war', 'was', 'end', 'Sheen', 'character', 'back', 'redeemer', 'whe', 'finally', 'Elias', 'position', 'war.Overall', 'touching', 'movie', 'more', 'focused', 'symbolism', 'imagery', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Kubrick', 'quot', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'quot', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'quot', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'quot', 'still', 'more', 'poetic', 'vision', 'rather', 'realistic']",N/A

152494,A2YYNR7VU2DS8T,0792845129,Patrick,"[1, 4]","""Platoon"" definately stands out as one of the most beautiful and finest war movies ever made. While not exactly having a plot, Stone paints a vivid picture of the horrors of war. it's basicly about Chris (Charlie Sheen), a colledge dropout who decides to volunteer to go off and fight in Vietnam. He quickly learns that war is no game; it's a living hell. there are two sergeants fighting over command of Chris's platoon, and he is influenced by both. Willem Dafoe (in his best screen performance) portrays Sgt. Elias, a skilled veteran who no longer believes in the war, but continues to do so. Tom Berenger (in a perfect role), is the psychotic Sgt. Barnes, whose facial scars are a mirror for his life and personality. As the tension between the two sergeants rises, the platoon is torn apart when a simple battle has tragic consequences. i will not tell you what happens, but i will tell you this: as Elias runs across the field, the enemy in hot pursuit, he throws up his arms, as to ask ""why?"". perhaps this is the point of the film. why were we in Vietnam? Chris is transformed from a soft-spoken colledge boy into a bloodthirsty killing-machine. this may be the best film about Vietnam ever, but it's hard to tell. the enemy, however, is the strange part. you never clearly see them; they are just distant figures, fighting for a cause that the Americans really can never understand.",5,incrediable!,998784000,"08 26, 2001",2001,1391,"['Platoon', 'definately', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'finest', 'war', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'exactly', 'having', 'plot', 'Stone', 'vivid', 'picture', 'horrors', 'war', 'basicly', 'Chris', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'colledge', 'dropout', 'who', 'volunteer', 'go', 'off', 'fight', 'Vietnam', 'quickly', 'war', 'game', 'living', 'hell', 'are', 'two', 'sergeants', 'fighting', 'command', 'Chris', 'platoon', 'influenced', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'best', 'screen', 'performance', 'Sgt', 'Elias', 'skilled', 'veteran', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'war', 'do', 'so', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'perfect', 'role', 'psychotic', 'Sgt', 'Barnes', 'facial', 'scars', 'are', 'mirror', 'life', 'personality', 'tension', 'two', 'sergeants', 'rises', 'platoon', 'torn', 'apart', 'when', 'simple', 'battle', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'i', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'i', 'will', 'tell', 'Elias', 'field', 'enemy', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'up', 'arms', 'ask', 'why', 'perhaps', 'point', 'film', 'why', 'were', 'Vietnam', 'Chris', 'transformed', 'soft-spoken', 'colledge', 'boy', 'bloodthirsty', 'killing-machine', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'Vietnam', 'ever', 'hard', 'tell', 'enemy', 'however', 'strange', 'part', 'never', 'clearly', 'see', 'are', 'just', 'distant', 'figures', 'fighting', 'cause', 'Americans', 'really', 'can', 'never', 'understand']",N/A
152495,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,0792845129,Patrick L. Randall,"[5, 5]","""Platoon"" wasn't necessarily a labor of love for director Oliver Stone, but it was a project that he wanted so passionately to see succeed, that he would not stop until it became a reality.  After several years of financial problems and recasts, Stone's definitive portrayal of the Vietnam experience came to the big screen.  Just a little over a decade removed from the last days of the war, American audiences had not yet been exposed such a raw, unblinking tale of the battles faced by men who fought in the Southeast Asia jungles, both with the Viet Cong and among (and within) themselves.""Platoon"" is told from the point of view of the narrator, a 'fresh-meat, private named Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen).  Taylor is new to Vietnam and a decidedly different kind of horse from those in his unit.  Taylor was actually in college, and lived in a well-off family.  Yet, feeling disaffected by his life, he decided he wanted to make a difference and defend his nation (A 'crusader' one of his fellow soldiers calls him).  Therefore, he enlisted and signed up for infantry duty.  Taylor's idealism is quickly crushed by the harsh realities of war.  Long marches and guard duty in rain, sweltering heat, and in the midst of fire ants become the norm for these men.  The only break from this monotony is the regular attacks by Viet Cong on their positions.  Drifting into a drug or alcohol-induced haze back at base camp and counting down the days until their tour is over is the only escape they have.The main of the story follows the platoon's marches through villages suspected of supporting the enemy army.  A division in the platoon threatens to destroy the men as much as any enemy attack.  At the forefront are Sergeants Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Barnes (Tom Berenger).  Elias is a compassionate, yet highly skilled, leader who truly cares about his men while Barnes is a dark, iron-willed man whose strengths in battle become liabilities when the guns aren't going off.  Elias knows where the line is between doing everything possible to destroy the enemy without losing one's humanity, while Barnes seems to have forgotten where that line was long ago.  These two competing ideologies threaten to tear the platoon apart, and are not helped in any measure by a weak-willed Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses) who is too scared of Barnes to assert any command authority and defuse the situation.  Berenger brings such a dark, brooding demeanor to his role as Barnes that he would terrify the audience if they ever met him in real life.  Barnes has been shot 7 times.  He's not meant to die.  Dafoe's portrayal of Elias illuminates the struggle of a man who knows that fair treatment of his men will get better results out of them (and get more of them back alive), yet has to try to keep Barnes psychopathic tendencies in check.""Platoon"" set the standard for brutally honest, unyielding films about war; a standard that was later raised by films like ""Saving Private Ryan"".  As difficult as it is to watch, it is just as equally compelling to watch.

The  movie had a huge impact on me because I was doing work that was still  part/aftermath of the Vietnam conflict. The movie is a classic. Excellent  acting performance by Charlie Sheen here as Pvt. Chris Taylor, Tom Berenger  as Sgt. Barnes, and William Defoe as Elias. The movie is about a young  recruit's tour of duty in Vietnam. The recruit slowly transforms from a  young, innocent college student to an experienced combat soldier who still  maintains a sense of idealism and morality amidst the chaos and brutality  of this unpopular war. This is not your Rambo type of movie. In fact, you  might even be disappointed about the lack of firefight scenes in the movie.  But firefight scenes don't make a good war movie. A good war movie must  also send a message and this movie did it. Is this an anti-war film? I  didn't think it was an anti-war film.

The screenplay is brilliant and doesn't fall into the trap that other war  films fall into, where the violence turns into a fun experience and  fighting seems &quot;cool.&quot; This is a movie that truly shows the  horrors of war realistically and with great effect. The cinematography by  Robert Richardson (JFK, Natural Born Killers) is rich and gritty, giving  more feeling to already great material. The characters are believable and  convincing. It's great work because Stone himself went to Vietnam, so he  has a better idea of what happened than Francis Ford Coppola when he made  &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (which is also a great movie).  &quot;Platoon&quot; is mesmerizing, powerful, effective, disturbing and  even philosophical. It is one of Stone's greatest works. He ignites the  screen with passion. The music is incredibly moving.

152503,A1C6WSEQSRPFNB,0792845129,Pinealdoorway,"[12, 15]","Having read some of these reviews I can honestly say that those of you who were not there should not Judge because nobody who was not there will ever know what we went thru over there and to those who would bad mouth Oliver stone who himself was a Vietnam Vet I would like to say, After Seeing ""Apocalypse Now"" ""Full Metal Jacket"" and all these other bogus movies about Vietnam.Platoon,as far as I'm concerned was the way I saw Vietnam, It was the first film on Vietnam that portrayed the realization that we were not just fighting the NVA,(North Vietnamese Army) We were fighting each other.I was there in August of 1969, we had came in at Cam Rang Bay,then they sent us down to Bien Hoa for a couple of weeks then I flew up to Northern Vietnam to Phu Bai.I was with the 101st Airborne Division and I had just Missed Hamburger Hill.I did not want to go to Vietnam and fight a war that nobody really knew why we were there.I even went AWOL before I left fort Lewis Washington to go over there, I was A Counter Culture person from Southern Cal. And was Against the war.I remember one night it was raining really hard, I mean it was coming down so hard you could not see two feet in front of you, Now I was in a supply company and these guys who had been out in the bush for like two weeks with no hot food,no dry socks to keep from getting Jungle Rot.I was standing in the mess line waiting to get some grub and the little Fat Red Neck Fist Sargent was standing there hassling these guys with all of this State side Stuff like get your hands and of your Pockets, Straighten out that Baseball Cap.That night after chow a friend of mine that I went to high School with that I met over there, We were sitting around smoking a Joint all of a we sudden hear this...Boom,Boom,Boom and all these MP'S were running around searching everybody and everything,Someone Apparently didn't like being hassled by the First Sargent and they grenaded his hooch, lucky for him he wasn't in it.In Platoon you see it, The Oakie's were in one corner listening to their country music, the Juicers were in another corner drinking their Alcoholic Juice and The Heads were Partying remembering what it was like back in the World. Oliver Stone Portrayed it perfect.There was so much discrimination over there between all of us,We were fighting each other,There was this Black guy over there who was also from California and like me was from the LSD-Rock-Hippie Culture we used to hang out and get high together and it used to piss off the other black people.It was total confusion over there.Nobody really knew why we were there,When Oliver Stone has Charlie Sheen say...We were grunts from Jerk Water USA, they were the bottom of the barrel, Nobodies,People that nobody cared about.Not one Politician lost a son in Vietnam and that was one of the reasons that we never went back there to get the Pow's and Mia's was because the books were in the Red, The War didn't turn a Profit so there was no profit for them to go back there and get them.The NVA were highly motivated and well trained, they knew how to fight, we were on there turf, they hid in trees and under ground.I remember they would constantly tell you...Stay Alert,Stay Alive, Kill or be Killed. You learned to sleep with one eye open.I remember there was this one guy who was an Oakie from the South, he was pissed off that he was in a supply company, he wanted to be out on the front lines killing some dinks. It was crazy. How many times I was on perimeter guard scared out of my mind.How many times I would listen to these 105's going off that were so loud we thought that they were incoming rounds scrambling around trying to find a sand bag to hide behind.How many of us that were over there are still suffering from PTSD,How many of us cannot get help even today from the VA because they don't want to pay us for PTSD.They Screw you up but then they don't want to fix you.Jimi Hendrix was a Vietnam Vet he was also in the 101st, he was there for the Tet Offense, he lost four of his toes on his left foot and got a medical discharge.So many of my Friends in 1967 whose draft cards were 1a came back from Vietnam so screwed up. It was a very sad time for those of us who were there.Yeah,Platoon was the way I saw Vietnam. I am thankful that people today realize that War is hell and that this Planet will never evolve until we can learn to turn the other cheek, Until we can learn to forgive one another.Albert Einstein once said...""The Creations of our Minds should be used as a blessing for mankind instead of a curse.""We are constantly inventing newer and better weapons and bombs to kill each other off.God's

Mr. Stone's screen alterego is Chris Taylor who is played by Charlie Sheen.  Chris is a high-minded kid who feels by volunteering, he can make a difference.  He is influenced by two of the Platoon's sergeants.  They are polar extremes, with the angelic Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and the satanic Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger).  At first Chris is taken with Barnes' take no prisoners attitude, but they after being injured in battle, he falls under the spell of Sgt. Elias.  He gets turned on to marijuana by the heads in the platoon.  The movie shows the struggle that Chris goes through and we are shown the hell that war really is. In Hollywood, war was glorified.  In the late 70's, the shift started to show the scars war could leave on someone.  Platoon was the first movie to really show in graphic and horrifying detail how war affected men and the country in which they did battle. Platoon is a haunting, brilliant masterpiece.

152505,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,0792845129,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[2, 3]","This review discusses the structure of the movie starting from the approach of a very important spoiler.  Reader beware.When I first saw this, I felt pretty disappointed in how a sense of the glory of war still seemed to have slipped its way into the mix through the character of Elias, played by Willem Dafoe.  Somehow Dafoe's moralistic inner-strength and the way he can run into combat to kick butt without any support because, ""Other people just slow me down,"" seemed incongruous with the overarching point of intensifying the destructive feelings of fear, stress, and anger felt during combat.However, regarding Elias as a symbol of what the innocent people like Chris wanted to believe came out of war helps to reinforce the theme stated at the end of the movie: ""We are in war against ourselves and our enemies are really within us.""  Sergeant Barnes' (Berenger) hidden execution of Elias shows the ultimate distruction of that romantic heroism from within rather than without.It is from that point that the high levels of violence, bodies ripping apart, disturbing fights, and harrowing warfare surrounds itself to become more than just voyeuristic appraisal of the Vietnam War.  Much has been said about Oliver Stone's involvement in the war and how this movie was created of his experiences, but I think it's important to point out that Stone's writing and directing is strong enough that his reputation as a veteran is not the only excuse for the disturbing and disgusting images of a film that has upon second-thought no inspection, but contains itself admirably as a parable for the state of American politics at the time.  Sure his use of an almost all-black cast for Sgt. Elias' half of the troop and all-white cast (a good few with strong ""hick"" accents) for Sgt. Bob's half is a bit heavy-handed, but the point is still solid.This is also probably a really good film to watch just to cast light on a lot of what happens in Stone's other films.  Ultimately this is the only Stone film I've seen so far that I've felt comfortable calling a ""Stone film"" because of his strong and specific approach to it.

Amidst the fighting going on with the enemy, there's is a battle going on amongst themselves. Caught between two commanding Sergeants, Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Barnes (Tom Berenger), Taylor finds himself along with the other soldiers, having his loyalties divided.""Platoon"" is an film written and directed by Oliver Stone. It's no wonder that this movie received 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1986. A very intense movie, everything is well done from the acting, cinematography, and camera work.The acting is what probably makes ""Platoon"" such a riveting story. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger as the two sergeants are so good in their roles but Charlie Sheen is who shines in his role as Chris Taylor. Keith David as King was also very good as Taylor's almost only friend. Other actors starring in ""Platoon"" are Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, Richard Edson, Kevin Dillon, Reggie Johnson, and Johnny Depp.I actually give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars but put 4 stars. The reason is mostly because it's rated R. Because I'm 15 years old, I probably don't know much about Vietnam or war but the movie was a bit too violent and the language is very strong. Maybe the director wanted to make ""Platoon"" as realistic as possible but yet sometimes I wish there were PG-13 versions for some R rated movies. Yet I found the acting done exceptionally well done.""But be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again.

It, for the most part is very clean, crisp and clear.  The only grain you will see is in some of the dusty sky scenes.The sound however is mediocre at best.  Yes, it's a 5.1 mix but it makes VERY little use of the surrounds which pretty much makes it a 3.1.  The special effect sounds, gunfire and explosions are pretty much monoaural and very static and almost muffled.  Just not your typcial hi-definiton sound mix.  What's strange is that Hamburger Hill which was made just a year later has equisitly better sound all around.  In fact, Hamburger Hill has said to have had the most realistic Vietnam sounds effects ever.The extras on this disc though are pretty good.  The ""Tour of the Inferno"" documentary was very interesting and really dove deep into Oliver Stone's vision and experiences while filming the picture in the Phillipines during the Ferdinand coup in 1985.

152515,A2IYUCI5A26O82,0792845129,R. Hansen,"[3, 3]","This sits right behind `The Godfather' as my all time favorite movie. Actually I have probably watched this film more times than any other. A friend and I had seen this so many times that if one of us quoted a line from it the other would answer with the next part of the script and then we would go on for about 15 minutes verbatim from the dialogue (much to the annoyance of anyone around us).Though I've never been in combat, I have been in the Army for 17 years and I have a feeling (from knowing my fellow soldiers like I do) that this movie is accurate in portraying combat and the life of the grunt in Vietnam. And if it is this verite that compels the film, it the acting that keeps it focused. The supporting cast is tight and the three main players (Sheen, Berenger and Dafoe) are outstanding. Stone really inspired these men and brought out indelible performances.The intensity of this work is severe. It is commensurate with a good horror film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, but in this case the horror is all too real. Three scenes are particularly nonplusing: the playing of `Tracks of My Tears' in the middle of the film as a clear point in which to delineate the hopelessness of the soldiers; the fulminating village scene culminating in Barnes with the gun to the little girls head and the disconcerted face of Chris as he strains with emotion, wanting to say something; and the incomparable tableau of Elias' death, arms outstretched to the sky as the chopper flies by. That scene has affected me like few scenes ever have, and it always takes me a few minutes to recover from it. It is one of the most powerful film moments I have ever seen. And Stone's choice of `Aidiago For Strings' for the background music was very perceptive.The only question I have about the movie is the ending. I can't praise it or condemn it. I suppose that it is realistic, but it seems to lessen the humanity of Chris especially considering his final words about going from this point to make a better world. It just seems like such a great film deserved a better ending but, as I cannot come up with one myself, I'll keep my criticism low.A quick side note: I met Corey Glover who played `Francis' (the guy who stabs himself in the leg at the end in order to go home) in Stuttgart Germany. He was the lead singer for the band `Living Colour' (they had a hit with the song `Cult of Personality') and they were playing a club there. He was very cordial and talkative.

152516,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,0792845129,RJ Smoove,"[2, 2]","I'll start this critique off by declaring that I love this movie. Platoon is the epitome of not only the war film genre, but also controversial director Oliver Stone's body of work. There are so many great things to say about this movie, and as far as I am concerned, not too many negatives that I can think of. For starters, Platoon is a strong number one as my favorite Vietnam war film of all time. Its message was simple, yet powerful. ""The first casualty of war is innocence."" For a story so emotionally impactful, how can it also be so entertaining? Well, it was mainly because of the characters. They were all different, with various personalities. And I give all the credit to the incredible cast of young guys that made up the infantry unit that the film centers around. I'm pretty sure it was not as fantastic when it first came out because half of those guys had not yet made names for themselves and become the enormous stars that they are today, especially a fresh faced Johnny Depp. But I was still pleasantly surprised to see so many great actors, and even in their youth they cranked out some high caliber, phenomenal performances.Charlie Sheen was a perfect choice as our impressionable lead, Chris. I felt like I was progressing through the story with him, rather than just watching him mature into who he became. Willem Dafoe was one of my favorites as Sgt. Elias. His character was a bit of an oddball, if you will. Going off on his own to flank the VCAs and take them out alone. He served as one of cooler, more sympathetic soldiers in the platoon. Another one of my favorites was Keith David as King. I have been a fan of his since I first heard his unmistakably iconic voice. There was also the young hot head, played to perfection by Kevin Dillon of Entourage fame. And another fantastic performance that is officially an addition to my list of Favorite Movie Villains was Tom Berenger as Sgt. Barnes. When I first I saw this film it happened to be just one week after I watched The Deer Hunter for the first time as well. The Deer Hunter, while an excellent character study, left me feeling like something was missing from the middle section of the story. I felt like Platoon filled that gap perfectly. If I could insert Platoon into the center of The Deer Hunter, that would be the perfect Vietnam war movie. I'm kidding, but honestly, I cannot think of much to complain about. Platoon is just an all around excellent war film, in my opinion. And even though it is my number one favorite Vietnam war film, I think it falls just behind Saving Private Ryan as my favorite war film period. Still, this is a classic, and it definitely deserved every award it received.Platoon is a classic, and I'm sure whoever I'm lucky enough to have reading my late review has already seen it and is aware of how great the film is. What's more important here it the transfer. While the transfer may have its ups and downs, it certainly is leaps and bounds better than the old DVD. When it is at its best, the picture quality is phenomenal. It's sharper than ever, detailed, and the colors are very well represented. When the picture quality is at its lowest, it's not terrible, but I would say it's more like just okay. Perhaps it's a bit uneven. This is similar to how I feel about the original 2008 Predator Blu-ray release that got its fair share of hate. There is a constant layer of grain throughout, and it looks thicker at some times than others, but like I said, this is never a terrible looking Blu-ray transfer. As for the audio, it is not as good as the picture quality, sadly, but it isn't terrible either. It's decent, and gets the job done.

152517,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,0792845129,Robert Blake,"[1, 1]","Hollywood has always had very diverse angles when it comes to making movies about the Vietnam war. Francis Coppola and Michael Cimino painted good but overly melodramatic and mostly glossy movies about the war in films like ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Deer Hunter."" Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" remains the greatest, the most realistic and haunting depiction ever. The heart of the impact of the movie lies in the fact that Stone served in Vietnam, can't shake it and used his brilliance as an artist to depict his experiences and the experiences of many, in one of the greatest war films ever made. ""Platoon"" is real and alive, taking us deep into the jungles and never ceases to show us the realities of what happened, ultimately evoking the feelings of many veterans who came back either shattered or changed forever by a senseless war. The photography by Robert Richardson is gritty but yet also rich when capturing the vast jungle landscapes. The violence is not fun but realistic and truthful to what war really is and Stone brilliantly depicts how normal men thrown into such a hostile, primitive scenario can easily go mad and turn into violent killers. The characters are incredibly authentic, these don't feel like typical heroic war movie people, who have a super-hero quality to them, these are frightened young men caught in the realities of warfare. Charlie Sheen gives probably his best performance here and sometimes we can easily relate to him. ""Platoon"" also stands as a very influential film and if you look closely at it's style and pacing, you realize films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" are the descendants of ""Platoon,"" those two other movies have a lot to owe to this one. This special edition DVD is a great package featuring a great documentary titled ""Tour Of The Inferno"" where the actors and Stone himself talk in detail about the hard process of making the film. Johnny Depp appears and remembers thinking of Stone as a ""madman, one of those guys who walk the fine line between brilliance and explosion of the brain."" Indeed, ""Platoon"" would have been a big mess under less-talented hands. This is a magnificent tribute to those who fought and a searing document for the new generations watching the movie, a lesson about where we should not tread and the power of trying to survive and how life goes on.

has gotten to him so much that he is an unfeeling souless monster he is the perfect exampleof the tragedy of Vietnam for Stone to do this is brillant and real.The most shocking scene in Platoon is when they aretold to infeltrate a vietnamese camp and the real tragedy ofplatoon is shown , when all sense of humanity is lost when crimes are commited against it and these are the very men whoshold

152521,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0792845129,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","Charlie Sheen is Chris, a rich college boy who dropped out of college in the late 1960's to volunteer for combat duty in Vietnam.  Partly out of guilt for those who had to go because they couldn't weasel out of the draft, and also clueless as to the desperation of the situation, Chris heads off to infantry, and his eyes are opened.  He finds his combat unit ruled by three archetypes representing the American experience in the pre-Tet days of the war: the benign Sgt. Elias (Willem Defoe), the amoral Sgt O'neill (one of the first of a long-line of selfish louts played by John McGinley) and the utterly evil Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger).  His first days are predictably disastrous - earning the scorn of his platoon's more seasoned soldiers after he falls asleep during an ambush - and his noble thoughts are dashed.  The Platoon's sojourn in-country becomes a battle of wills between Elias and Barnes, largely centering on the summary execution of villagers living near a nest of Viet Cong tunnels.  The soldiers of the platoon take opposite sides meant to symbolize the fragmentation of America, though the constant threat of attack keeps them from coming to blows.  In the heat of battle, Barnes kills Elias, cementing his fate in Chris's eyes.  The film climaxes in a horrific night battle between an American unit stretched too thin and a massive brigade of North Vietnamese soldiers.This film kicked off a rush of Vietnam-war movies in the mid-1980's, like ""Full Metal Jacket"" and a prime time show called ""Tour of Duty"", and to hear people talking, it was as if nobody had ever made a remotely realistic or powerful film about the war - earlier films being condemned as Rambo-movies, excepting truly powerful films which weren't really out to tell the story of the war (Like ""Coming Home"" and ""The Deer Hunter"").  Some of the film's realism seems questionable (Chris shoots at the feet of a man who was hiding from the soldiers when the Platoon enters the village, yet the Soldiers, on edge from finding their buddies crucified outside the village, don't react to the gunfire at all; the final battle climaxes in an airstrike guided in from the ground - where's the FAC?) and the moral battle between Barnes and Elias is hokey, but overall, the film works well and deserves its rep.

So much so that I've had to give it a rest over the last few years.Why is it so good?Perhaps because it is the most realistic (certainly Vietnam) war movie ever made. Its based on Oliver Stones own experiences in Vietnam. Now I doubt whether there were actually two so clearly good and bad characters, as represented by Willem Dafoe and Tom Beringer in the film, but it is the spark between these two that creates much of the films atmosphere.There are quite a few scenes in this film, such as when the Charlie Sheen character wakes up in the middle of the night (in the jungle), that are wonderfully done.

152533,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,0792845129,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[1, 2]","Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" is not a cinematic glamorization of war.  This is a mature critique of the stark and horrifying realities of armed conflict.  It is also a bold production that forever changed how Hollywood would make war films in the future.Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a college dropout who volunteers for military duty because he feels it is his patriotic duty to serve in Vietnam.  He immediately realizes he is in over his head as the long sleepless nights and ever-present dangers start to wear him down.  Two figures start to play important roles in his life - Sergeant Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger), the scarred veteran who represents the darker aspects of human nature, and Sergeant Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), the mentor and friend who symbolizes the generosity and goodness in humanity.  While trying to survive the perils around him, Taylor comes to realize that the hostile dynamics within his platoon are proving to be just as dangerous as the engagements with enemy forces.""Platoon"" is not a film populated by indestructible warriors who engage in false heroics.  It is a film that examines how war can dramatically alter one's notions of right and wrong and good and evil.  Stone pulls no punches in getting across the point that war oftentimes brings out the worst qualities in human beings.  Watching his characters deteriorate into savagery because of the chaos that surrounds them is a sobering viewing experience.  Stone also adds a unique dimension to the film by emphasizing how the Vietnam experience turned American soldiers against each other.  The conventional ""enemy"" soldiers in the film are nothing more than faceless entities.  Yet, the conflict within the platoon is vividly portrayed as the disparate attitudes of its members lead to horrifying incidents that pit platoon soldier against platoon soldier.  Watching conflict where there should be no conflict destroys the notion of the unified sense of purpose that characterized war films of earlier eras.  Much credit should be given to Stone for redefining the war experience for a new generation of filmgoers.",3,"""This is bad, man.

It is not just a simple war movie with one side fighting the other, but instead warring factions between units.  The story follows one platoon as they attempt to survive the war.  The unit is divided in two groups and are led by two completely different men with completely different outlooks on life.  Platoon is very effective in showing the horrors of war committed by both sides while also showing the terror and brutality of battle.  This is not for the faint of heart but it is still an excellent movie.The casting for Platoon could not have been any better than it is.  Charlie Sheen plays Chris Taylor, the young private who volunteered for the army and the person who we see the movie through.  Tom Berenger and Wilem Dafoe star as the opposing sergeants in the platoon.  These two are the best performances in the whole movie.  Dafoe's Sergeant Elias is a hippie soldier who cares for his men while Berenger's Sergeant Barnes is a die hard soldier who won't let anything stand in his way.  The rest of the cast includes Keith David, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Dale Dye, Francesco Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Mark Moses, and Johnny Depp. Also the Adagio for Strings is the perfect music for this movie that helps to show the horror of the war and also the loss of innocence in the soldiers.

And of course Sheen, matching his father for being in a Vietnam film (Apocalypse Now) and does a great job.The plot is based on a small platoon of men trying to survive during the Vietnam war. Straight forward but executed to perfection. Don't expect it to be cushy either, there are a few harrowing scenes, definately not a film for the faint hearted.

The movie revolves around a young American soldier, Pvt. Chris Taylor (a young Charlie Sheen) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty.  The battle sequences are very gritty, graphic, and realistic.  Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews.  Grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict, while Barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war.  At its core then, PLATOON is a movie about the internal war for one soldier's soul between good and evil.  Though Stone based the film upon his own experiences, there are scenes that have been embellished and the view Stone presents is only one view of the war--see the film WE WERE SOLDIERS for the opposite view as presented by Stone in PLATOON.Despite the negative outlook upon life, the military, and the Vietnam War, PLATOON is probably Oliver Stone's best movie to date.  Stone's direction of the film is brilliant from the two-week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming, to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes, to filming in sequence, to recognizing the talent of Johnny Depp, Stone illustrated in PLATOON was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with.  The film contains fine performances: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, and Johnny Depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity, despite the deep metaphysical connotations.  PLATOON won the 1986 Oscar for Best Picture, Stone won the Best Director Oscar, and also received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.I was surprised and found that I enjoyed PLATOON, though there were several parts of the film that I found myself aghast.  I've never been in battle myself, but I do know that war is hell.  Nevertheless, I cannot bring myself to agree with the film's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one's soul to evil.  Despite this, there are many positive things within the movie.  This is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well (though they might prefer something more hopeful such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS).",5,"Realistic, Yet Hopeless War Story.",1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2612,"['Based', 'director', 'writer', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'own', 'experiences', 'Vietnam', 'PLATOON', 'was', 'first', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'war', 'directed', 'veteran', 'conflict', 'movie', 'around', 'young', 'American', 'soldier', 'Pvt', 'Chris', 'Taylor', 'young', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'platoon', 'fights', 'tour', 'duty', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'very', 'gritty', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'Taylor', 'direct', 'leadership', 'Sgt', 'Elias', 'Grodin', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'men', 'are', 'command', 'Staff', 'Sgt', 'Bob', 'Barnes', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Grodin', 'Barnes', 'have', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'views', 'leadership', 'opposing', 'worldviews', 'Grodin', 'everything', 'good', 'noble', 'worth', 'fighting', 'conflict', 'Barnes', 'evil', 'ugliness', 'war', 'core', 'then', 'PLATOON', 'movie', 'internal', 'war', 'one', 'soldier', 'soul', 'good', 'evil', 'Stone', 'based', 'film', 'own', 'experiences', 'are', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'embellished', 'view', 'Stone', 'only', 'one', 'view', 'war', 'see', 'film', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', 'opposite', 'view', 'presented', 'Stone', 'PLATOON.Despite', 'negative', 'outlook', 'life', 'military', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'PLATOON', 'probably', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'best', 'movie', 'date', 'Stone', 'direction', 'film', 'brilliant', 'two-week', 'boot', 'actors', 'endured', 'principal', 'filming', 'fine', 'details', 'such', 'color', 'wrapping', 'paper', 'cigarettes', 'filming', 'sequence', 'recognizing', 'talent', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Stone', 'illustrated', 'PLATOON', 'was', 'was', 'great', 'director', 'one', 'be', 'reckoned', 'film', 'fine', 'performances', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Francesco', 'Quinn', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'give', 'powerful', 'portrayals', 'ground', 'movie', 'humanity', 'deep', 'metaphysical', 'connotations', 'PLATOON', 'won', '1986', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Stone', 'won', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'also', 'received', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'found', 'enjoyed', 'PLATOON', 'were', 'several', 'parts', 'film', 'found', 'aghast', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'battle', 'do', 'know', 'war', 'hell', 'Nevertheless', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'agree', 'film', 'negative', 'worldview', 'ultimately', 'loss', 'one', 'soul', 'evil', 'are', 'many', 'positive', 'things', 'movie', 'movie', 'film', 'buff', 'should', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'war', 'movies', 'might', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'prefer', 'something', 'more', 'hopeful', 'such', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS']",N/A

Charlie Sheen plays Chris Taylor, whose idealism drives him to leave college for the hellish jungles of Vietnam. He sheds his innocence quickly, however, as the horrors of war take a heavy toll on his body and his sanity. After witnessing acts of barbarity by fellow soldiers--including rape and the deliberate killing of civilians--Taylor becomes aware that he is fighting not only an external enemy, but an inner one as well.Representing the sides of this internal battle are Sergeant Elias (William Dafoe), who shows compassion towards his men and is outraged by atrocities he witnesses, and Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), who displays no regard for human life. With their sanity pushed to its limits by the terror of combat, members of the platoon are torn between the two men and begin to turn on each other.This film is disturbing in its brutal realism, and the painful questions it raises remain relevant decades after the Vietnam War, particularly in light of incidents such as the Haditha massacre and the overwhelming numbers of Iraq veterans struggling with PTSD.

Dafoe believes the war is lost.The special effects are no longer the best (The 'explosions' look more like pyrotechnics or expensive fireworks). But this has to be quite possibly the most realistic war film ever made. The reason is probably because director Oliver Stone was a service man in Vietnam.

152552,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,0792845129,Wheelchair Assassin,"[5, 7]","Unlike many war movies, ""Platoon"" forces the viewer to confront a harsh truth: war is NOT an ennobling experience, and it does not make you a better person.  In fact, war is just as likely to bring out the worst in people as the best.  I was a history major, and I still maintain an interest in the subject, and I find Oliver Stone's depiction of war to be far more realistic than that of, say, Steven Spielberg in ""Saving Private Ryan.""  The soldiers in ""Platoon"" are just like people in real life: some good, some bad, some indifferent.  For most of them, it's just about survival.  The battle scenes aren't as graphically violent as in more recent movies, but they do a good job of capturing the fear and confusion that war can create.  More importantly, the story is filled with sharply-drawn characters and moral ambiguity.  ""Platoon"" centers around the conflict between two Sergeants, Tom Berenger's Barnes and Willem Dafoe's Elias.  The battle-hardened Barnes believes in doing whatever is necessary to win the war, including killing  noncombatants, while the mellower Elias resists Barnes's Machiavellian, win-at-all-costs approach.  Their disputes, which end when Barnes kills Elias, raise some important questions: how civilized can combatants in a war be expected to behave?  Where is the line drawn? Is it acceptable to do anything, no matter how inhumane, to accomplish military objectives?  The movie doesn't really provide answers to these questions; I'm not even sure there are any right answers.

152553,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0792845129,Wuchak,"[1, 2]","That's the title card to Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam War masterpiece ""Platoon"", but you're not going to see much rejoicing in this film 'cause it identifies the Vietnam infantry experience as no less than hell on earth.THE PLOT: Chris Taylor naively volunteers for combat in Vietnam (late '67 through '68) and slowly adapts to the jungle warfare and becomes an adequate grunt. A rift eventually develops between the senior sergeant, Barnes (Tom Berenger), and the junior sergeant, Elias (Willem Dafoe); the former a veritable indestructible killing machine and the latter an expert soldier who refuses to allow the horrors of war to rob him of his humanity.""Platoon"" is masterful moviemaking in practically every way and towers over most other Vietnam war flicks, with the sole exception of ""Apocalypse Now"" (the original version). What works best is the ensemble cast and the numerous memorable characters who all smack of real life -- Taylor, Barnes, Elias, Lt. Wolfe, O'Neill, Bunny, Junior, King, Rhah, Crawford, Tex and Big Harold (amongst others). The idea that any filmmaker can effectively bring to life a dozen or more characters like this in a 2-hour film is uncanny to say the least.Memorable moments abound, including:- After stumbling upon a just-abandoned Vietcong nest where a soldier comes up missing, the platoon finds his corpse staked-up down the river and the camera slowly pans across the visage of practically every platoon member culminating with Barnes, who mutters with seething vengeance. This is a potent scene spotlighting a band of American warriors, from very diverse racial/ethnic/socio-economic backgrounds, forced together halfway around the world in some God-forsaken jungle to face an enemy of jungle wraiths.- After the Barnes/Elias fight at the village Barnes is informed by Captain Harris that there will be a full investigation. Barnes leaves the meeting and walks by his two disciples O'Niell and Bunny. O'Neill asks Barnes if there's going to be an investigation. The laconic Barnes stops but doesn't answer; he just looks away, as if in thought, smoking his cigarette. The camera stays on Barnes while Bunny responds: ""O'Neill, man, you worry to much; the sergeant will take care of him."" Looking at Barnes' countenance you just KNOW he's contemplating murder. The scene is filmmaking of the highest order.- In a dugout six of the soldiers who sided with Elias discuss what to do after it appears Elias had been shot by Barnes in combat. They all want to kill the scarred-face Barnes, but Rhah reveals Barnes' stature with the men is nigh mythological at this point; he's been hit seven times and still isn't dead. ""Barnes ain't meant to die! The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes"". A shirtless Barnes suddenly appears, drinking a bottle of whiskey; apparently he heard the whole conversation. He boldly confronts all six with a fascinating rant (""I am reality"") and challenges them to kill him. None of them take the bait because they deem him a human tiger, except Taylor, who's no match for Barnes in man-to-man combat. Although Barnes is the villain in the film you can't help but admire his sheer boldness and killer skills; it's clear why the men respect and fear him.By contrast, Elias is the compassionate, loving and righteous Christ-figure. If there's any doubt to this it's bludgeoned into the viewer via the melodramatic and unrealistic death scene, which can be excused on the grounds of its iconic imagery (the cover of the dvd) and obvious symbolism.Bunny (Kevin Dillon) is an interesting character. He's young, simple and likable but the war morphs him into a nigh-psychotic killer, so much so that he seriously creeps the other men out. But, again, he somehow maintains an amiable charm, unlike Tex who comes across wholly venomous.Some have criticized that it's impossible to make a war film that's anti-war on the grounds that war films by their nature make war seem fun in an adventurous way. Not so with ""Platoon"". How did Stone accomplish this? Well, aside from skillfully showing the hard day-to-day life of infantry men in the jungle, the combat scenes are viewed from the grunt's disoriented perspective where, often, there are no clear battle lines of good guys/bad guys (even within the platoon itself!); the enemy -- ghostly figures who are never clearly seen -- can come from any angle. Anything can and does happen, at anytime. Stone denies the viewer the feeling that this type of jungle combat makes sense. Needless to ask, how can anyone go through such without being inwardly scarred for life?Some criticize the flagrant cussing but Stone was shooting for realism; I know from experience that this is generally how grunts talk. I don't know about you but, if I'm going to see a war film, I want to see the awful truth, not some cleaned-up fantasy BS.The ending shows that Barnes & Elias are figurative of flesh & spirit, the conflicting forces within us all. [SPOILER] Taylor reflects, ""The war is over for me now, but it will always be there the rest of my days, as I'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called 'possession of my soul'. There are times since I've felt like a child, born of those two fathers. But, be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and a meaning to this life.""Amen.",5,"""Rejoice O young man in thy youth"" ~ Ecclesiastes 11:9",1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,5428,"['title', 'card', 'Oliver', 'Stone', '1986', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Platoon', ""'re"",

152554,A1OAJIRS05LWB,0792845129,Zach Pajak,"[4, 6]","Platoon is the first film on the subject of war that was directed by a war veteran, Oliver Stone.  The son of a wealthy family, Stone dropped out of Yale during the Vietnam War, volunteered as a private for the infantry, and was twice wounded and decorated.  In 1975, as Saigon was falling, he decided to relive his experiences of the war by writing a loosely autobiographical screenplay about them.  Stone decided to do it then because he feared that his familiarity with the war would soon be forgotten.  His screenplay of Platoon took 11 years to become a film, and became what is not only one of the best movies about war, but also a great achievement that compares powerfully with the most impressive movies in cinematic history.Charlie Sheen plays the role of Chris Taylor (a character who Stone based on himself), a callow yet well-meaning youth who volunteered for the war because he thought it was his patriotic duty and because he doesn't want to become a ""fake human being.""  He immediately realizes the horrible atrocities and brutality of war, as he provides a unique narrative through letters he writes to his grandmother.  The viewers, along with Chris, discover that the Vietnam War is a land with an ever-present atmosphere of danger, where every sound and movement brings an ominous threat of death.  As Chris loses his innocence, he witnesses the killing and torturing of Vietnamese villagers by American soldiers (who depend on drugs and alcohol to assuage their difficulties), betrayal, and a strong animosity within the platoon he's a member of.  The most notable of his experiences, however, is a moral battle that is fought over him by the saintly and pure Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) and the wicked, malevolent Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger).Released seven long years after Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Platoon was the next major film to seriously illustrate the Vietnam War.  What makes Platoon much different from Apocalypse Now is that Platoon does not strive too much to be artistic and also depicts the war more authentically.  In fact, the gritty realism of Platoon might make moviegoers incorrectly guess that it preceded Apocalypse Now.Platoon, like all of Stone's films, is nearly flawless in its making.  The cinematography, by the great Robert Richardson, is frankly remarkable.  Richardson's work with Platoon is brilliant and captures the violence and threatening feel of war.  Furthermore, the editing by Claire Simpson is equally praiseworthy.  In addition, one of the most special aspects of the film is the tremendously haunting and emotionally powerful use of Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings,"" which was arranged and conducted by Georges Delerue (who also provides the original music for the film).  Most importantly, however, is Stone's directing, which is displayed passionately in Platoon, and which makes this film even more of a masterpiece than the movie would have been with a different director.There is not one slacker in the cast of Platoon.  Every performance is delivered with strength and inspiring drama.  Sheen, as the disillusioned Chris, is simply amazing and does not render his character as being too solemn or innocent.  The true standouts, however, are Dafoe and Berenger.  Dafoe, as the Christ-like Sergeant Elias (who Stone considered having a Native American Indian portray), is convincing and charismatic.  His character never loses his moral compass and he depicts this fervently.  Tom Berenger performs frighteningly as Sergeant Barnes, the embodiment of evil and the symbol of the harsh realities of life (Barnes declares at one pivotal moment of the movie that ""I am reality"").  Berenger's performance is overshadowing and haunting as the exact opposite of Sergeant Elias, and makes the character of Barnes one of the most memorable villains in cinema.Platoon should be admired by all.  The film never tries to be too sentimental, yet is nonetheless quite emotional and hugely dramatic with its messages that war is a horrific and unpleasant event and that the enemy is often within ourselves.  It is an important movie that depicts the horrible nature of war with ardor, and will be remembered and as a classic and an accomplishment that surpasses other movies in its field.",5,Platoon is an important cinematic achievement,1046390400,"02 28, 2003",2003,4263,"['Platoon', 'first', 'film', 'subject', 'war', 'was', 'directed', 'war', 'veteran', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'son', 'wealthy', 'family', 'Stone', 'dropped', 'Yale', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'volunteered', 'private', 'infantry', 'was', 'twice', 'wounded', 'decorated', '1975', 'Saigon', 'was', 'falling', 'decided', 'relive', 'experiences', 'war', 'writing', 'loosely', 'autobiographical', 'screenplay', 'Stone', 'decided', 'do', 'then', 'feared', 'familiarity', 'war', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten', 'screenplay', 'Platoon', 'took', '11', 'years', 'become', 'film', 'became', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'war', 'also', 'great', 'achievement', 'powerfully', 'most', 'impressive', 'movies', 'cinematic', 'history.Charlie', 'Sheen', 'role', 'Chris', 'Taylor', 'character', 'who', 'Stone', 'based', 'callow', 'yet', 'well-meaning', 'youth', 'who', 'volunteered', 'war', 'thought', 'was', 'patriotic', 'duty', ""n't"", 'want', 'become', 'fake', 'human', 'being', 'immediately', 'horrible', 'atrocities', 'brutality', 'war', 'unique', 'narrative', 'letters', 'grandmother', 'viewers', 'Chris', 'discover', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'land', 'ever-present', 'atmosphere', 'danger', 'where', 'sound', 'movement', 'ominous', 'threat', 'death', 'Chris', 'innocence', 'killing', 'torturing', 'Vietnamese', 'villagers', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'depend', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'assuage', 'difficulties', 'betrayal', 'strong', 'animosity', 'platoon', 'member', 'most', 'notable', 'experiences', 'however', 'moral', 'battle', 'fought', 'saintly', 'pure', 'Sergeant', 'Elias', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'wicked', 'malevolent', 'Sergeant', 'Barnes', 'Tom', 'Berenger', '.Released', 'seven', 'long', 'years', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Platoon', 'was', 'next', 'major', 'film', 'seriously', 'illustrate', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'What', 'Platoon', 'much', 'different', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Platoon', 'not', 'strive', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'artistic', 'also', 'war', 'more', 'authentically', 'fact', 'gritty', 'realism', 'Platoon', 'might', 'make', 'moviegoers', 'incorrectly', 'guess', 'preceded', 'Apocalypse', 'Now.Platoon', 'Stone', 'films', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'making', 'cinematography', 'great', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'frankly', 'remarkable', 'Richardson', 'work', 'Platoon', 'brilliant', 'violence', 'threatening', 'feel', 'war', 'Furthermore', 'editing', 'Claire', 'Simpson', 'equally', 'praiseworthy', 'addition', 'one', 'most', 'special', 'aspects', 'film', 'tremendously', 'haunting', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'use', 'Samuel', 'Barber', 'Adagio', 'Strings', 'was', 'arranged', 'conducted', 'Georges', 'Delerue', 'who', 'also', 'original', 'music', 'film', 'Most', 'importantly', 'however', 'Stone', 'directing', 'displayed', 'passionately', 'Platoon', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'director.There', 'not', 'one', 'slacker', 'cast', 'Platoon', 'performance', 'delivered', 'strength', 'inspiring', 'drama', 'Sheen', 'disillusioned', 'Chris', 'simply', 'amazing', 'not', 'render', 'character', 'being', 'too', 'solemn', 'innocent', 'true', 'standouts', 'however', 'are', 'Dafoe', 'Berenger', 'Dafoe', 'Christ-like', 'Sergeant', 'Elias', 'who', 'Stone', 'considered', 'having', 'Native', 'American', 'Indian', 'portray', 'convincing', 'charismatic', 'character', 'never', 'moral', 'compass', 'fervently', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'frighteningly', 'Sergeant', 'Barnes', 'embodiment', 'evil', 'symbol', 'harsh', 'realities', 'life', 'Barnes', 'one', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'movie', 'am', 'reality', 'Berenger', 'performance', 'overshadowing', 'haunting', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Sergeant', 'Elias', 'character', 'Barnes', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'villains', 'cinema.Platoon', 'should', 'be', 'admired', 'film', 'never', 'be', 'too', 'sentimental', 'yet', 'nonetheless', 'quite', 'emotional', 'hugely', 'dramatic', 'messages', 'war', 'horrific', 'unpleasant', 'event', 'enemy', 'often', 'important', 'movie', 'horrible', 'nature', 'war', 'ardor', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'classic', 'accomplishment', 'other', 'movies', 'field']",N/A

The film depicts a platoon of young inexperienced soldiers. Chris, played by Charlie Sheen, is one of them. He volunteered for the war not knowing how terrible it would be. When he arrives he doesn't know what to do. He carries to much in his backpack, doesn't know what to do when he spots an enemy, and has no drive. As the film carries on we slowly see him, as well as his fellow members in the platoon become deadly killing machines.This film displays extreme violence, and corruption, so if you do not want to see that, stay away. The film is very disturbing and tragic. It shows how cruel, paranoid, and egocentric people can be, and how war can make them that way. After seeing this film, I cannot see how anyone would want to go to war.The script, and direction are very well done. There is no amazing acting, but we still feel for the characters though, as they battle in hell. This DVD has an amazing transfer, and has no problems with the way the picture looks, or sound. It also has good extras, with a documentary, two commentaries (by the director, and a war veteran), trailers, behind the scene pics, and production images. I highly recommend this DVD to people interested in military history, or dramatic films, but be warned, this film is not for light stomachs, as it is disturbing, and violent. 5 stars.",5,"""The first casualty of war, is innocence""",1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,1463,"['1986', 'film', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'as', 'well', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'based', 'experiences', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'film', 'platoon', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'soldiers', 'Chris', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'one', 'volunteered', 'war', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'terrible', 'would', 'be', 'When', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'much', 'backpack', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'spots', 'enemy', 'drive', 'film', 'slowly', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'fellow', 'members', 'platoon', 'become', 'deadly', 'killing', 'machines.This', 'film', 'displays', 'extreme', 'violence', 'corruption', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'stay', 'away', 'film', 'very', 'disturbing', 'tragic', 'how', 'cruel', 'paranoid', 'egocentric', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'war', 'can', 'make', 'way', 'seeing', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'go', 'war.The', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'amazing', 'acting', 'still', 'feel', 'characters', 'though', 'battle', 'hell', 'DVD', 'amazing', 'transfer', 'problems', 'way', 'picture', 'sound', 'also', 'good', 'extras', 'documentary', 'two', 'commentaries', 'director', 'war', 'veteran', 'trailers', 'scene', 'pics', 'production', 'images', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'people', 'interested', 'military', 'history', 'dramatic', 'films', 'be', 'warned', 'film', 'not', 'light', 'stomachs', 'disturbing', 'violent', '5', 'stars']",N/A
