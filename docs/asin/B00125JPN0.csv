But true game-show fans and amateur television historians will absolutely love this set.  It gives a glimpse of the birth of the longest-running game show in history, with games like ""Any Number"" and ""Hi-Lo"" that have become staples, and others like ""Give or Keep"" and ""Bullseye I"" that have passed into history.Understanding Bob Barker's stance on animal rights, it's a shame that so many episodes likely will not be released until after his death because fur coats were given as prizes.  As much as I respect his stand, it also deprives game-show lovers of valuable segments of history.  But to see the show in half-hour format brings back memories for me, because I'm old enough to remember the show before it expanded to an hour.",4,The price is right for this DVD compilation,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,905,"['People', 'looking', 'episodes', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'representing', '1980s', '1990s', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'eras', 'are', 'not', 'represented', 'four-disc', 'set', 'true', 'game-show', 'fans', 'amateur', 'television', 'historians', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'set', 'glimpse', 'birth', 'longest-running', 'game', 'show', 'history', 'games', 'Number', 'Hi-Lo', 'have', 'become', 'staples', 'others', 'Give', 'Keep', 'Bullseye', 'have', 'passed', 'history.Understanding', 'Bob', 'Barker', 'stance', 'animal', 'rights', 'shame', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'released', 'death', 'fur', 'coats', 'were', 'given', 'prizes', 'As', 'much', 'respect', 'stand', 'also', 'game-show', 'lovers', 'valuable', 'segments', 'history', 'see', 'show', 'half-hour', 'format', 'back', 'memories', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'show', 'expanded', 'hour']",The Best of The Price is Right

1134694,A3FLEK6G5M34SH,B00125JPN0,Chuck Donegan,"[3, 7]","Few game shows have managed the popularity and endurance of TPiR, and this DVD set has been long-awaited for fans like me. Highlights include:- 3 shows from the very first week, featuring the short-lived ""Bullseye I"" game (unfortunately, the premiere is not among them, since BCI was unable to compromise w/Barker over a fur coat being a prize in said ep)- A 1972 episode w/the equally short-lived ""Double Bullseye"" (the only 2-player pricing game in TPiR's history, and thus the only one that ever guaranteed a win)- A show from the 3rd anniversary week, where the hour format is first tried (featuring a completely different Showcase Showdown wheel!)- The first permanent hour show- 4 eps of the Bill Cullen version- Barker's entire final weekAnd much like BCI's earlier GS compilations (Match Game and All-Star Family Feud), all fee/ticket plugs are included for each ep, but this collection also includes something neither of the earlier 2 did: production slates! Nothing huge, but def cool to see and a nice little added bonus.My only complaint is over the inclusion of Barker's farewell week...yes, his last show should be on there, but I see no reason to include the rest of that week, especially considering there was no mention of the fact during those first 4 eps. If they wanted something more recent, why not one of the primetime anniversary shows, or Barker's final primetime show that saluted his TV career? But I understand that this collection had to be assembled w/Barker's approval, so it's not really a big deal and still a must-have for any game show/TPiR fan out there, and I hope it's the first of several volumes...there's still another 30+ years worth of shows waiting to be represented, and I'm sure the 1-star reviewer would like to see some eps from the mid-80s, as well! :-)",5,Better than a Double Showcase Win!,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,1802,"['Few', 'game', 'shows', 'have', 'managed', 'popularity', 'endurance', 'TPiR', 'DVD', 'set', 'been', 'long-awaited', 'fans', 'Highlights', 'include', '3', 'shows', 'very', 'first', 'week', 'featuring', 'short-lived', 'Bullseye', 'game', 'unfortunately', 'premiere', 'not', 'BCI', 'was', 'unable', 'compromise', 'w/Barker', 'fur', 'coat', 'being', 'prize', 'said', 'ep', '1972', 'episode', 'w/the', 'equally', 'short-lived', 'Double', 'Bullseye', 'only', '2-player', 'pricing', 'game', 'TPiR', 'history', 'thus', 'only', 'one', 'ever', 'guaranteed', 'win', 'show', '3rd', 'anniversary', 'week', 'where', 'hour', 'format', 'first', 'tried', 'featuring', 'completely', 'different', 'Showcase', 'Showdown', 'wheel', 'first', 'permanent', 'hour', 'show-', '4', 'eps', 'Bill', 'Cullen', 'version-', 'Barker', 'entire', 'final', 'weekAnd', 'much', 'BCI', 'earlier', 'GS', 'compilations', 'Match', 'Game', 'All-Star', 'Family', 'Feud', 'fee/ticket', 'plugs', 'are', 'included', 'ep', 'collection', 'also', 'something', 'earlier', '2', 'did', 'production', 'Nothing', 'huge', 'def', 'cool', 'see', 'nice', 'little', 'added', 'only', 'complaint', 'inclusion', 'Barker', 'farewell', 'week', 'yes', 'last', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'there', 'see', 'reason', 'include', 'rest', 'week', 'especially', 'considering', 'was', 'mention', 'fact', 'first', '4', 'eps', 'wanted', 'something', 'more', 'recent', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'primetime', 'anniversary', 'shows', 'Barker', 'final', 'primetime', 'show', 'saluted', 'TV', 'career', 'understand', 'collection', 'had', 'be', 'assembled', 'w/Barker', 'approval', 'not', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'still', 'must-have', 'game', 'show/TPiR', 'fan', 'there', 'hope', 'first', 'several', 'volumes', 'still', '30+', 'years', 'shows', 'waiting', 'be', 'represented', ""'m"", 'sure', '1-star', 'reviewer', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'eps', 'mid-80s', 'well']",The Best of The Price is Right

It is a blast seeing all the early episodes of THE NEW PRICE IS RIGHT I grew up on.  I was seven when it started in 1972.  The video quality is terrific and makes for great rewatchability.  The early episodes from the Bill Cullen years were neat to see; especially since one of them featured a neighbor of ours from my home town.  I never expected one of her episodes would be included.  I had heard about it all my life.  What a surprise.  Bob Barker's humor with the contestants is priceless.  I laughed so hard watching these shows.  Only 26 episodes out of over 6000 must have been hard to choose from, but I am glad there are a lot from 1972-1975.

1134699,A1RUBF0FK78E5Y,B00125JPN0,"Michael Ceciliani ""Mike C""","[25, 27]","Being a game show fan. I bought this set at Best Buy soon after its release. I had read about what would be on the set, so I wasn't as disappointed with some of the models and decades not being included. I also know why they weren't included, since I read and post regularly on a few web sites. For those not in the know, I'll share:Very first show is not included - because the very first item up for bids (IUFB) was a FUR COAT. Bob Barker has since become an animal rights activist and wouldn't clear the show, even though BCI, the makers of this collection, agreed to add a disclaimer. I think I have to side with Bob on this - it would be nice to see the show for historical purposes, but it does make him look like a hypocrite.Missing models and decades - Barker and his beauties have beefs with each other. He admitted to an affair he had with Dian Parkinson, who sued him for $8 million afterwards. Holly Holstrom sued him for unlawful termination when she was fired in 1995 for being overweight. She got money in a settlement that was reportedly in the millions. Janice and Kathleen were let go in 2000, mainly because they testified in Holly's lawsuit against Barker and sided with Holly. They supposedly were paid a severence package in agreement not to sue. The 80s and 90s shows featured all of the models mentioned. Apparently Barker doesn't want to models to get any more money. Janice is featured since she was on from the first show and Diane is on an hour-long show. No Holly or Kathleen in this set.No Rod Roddy - Bob reportedly got mad at Rod when he (Rod) went to negotiate for himself and the models that their salary for the nighttime specials should be equal to if not more than the daytime show. Bob cut Rod's on-camera time from the show after that. The excuse given was they ""no longer show announcers on camera."" Rod is not featured at all in this collection.Other than that, the collection shows how the present day TPIR evolved from a friendly, sometimes unpolished show to the slick and smooth show it is today, with Barker's last week included. The Bill Cullen shows are a great treat as well. Yes, there was a TPIR back in the 50s and 60s, and the Cullen shows prove it. Plus to hear Johnny O say ""Come on down"" once again. He's the one who made that phrase famous.",4,The real dirt on why some people and things are missing,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,2297,"['Being', 'game', 'show', 'fan', 'bought', 'set', 'Best', 'Buy', 'soon', 'release', 'had', 'read', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'disappointed', 'models', 'decades', 'not', 'being', 'included', 'also', 'know', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'read', 'post', 'regularly', 'few', 'web', 'sites', 'not', 'know', ""'ll"", 'share', 'Very', 'first', 'show', 'not', 'included', 'very', 'first', 'item', 'up', 'bids', 'IUFB', 'was', 'FUR', 'COAT', 'Bob', 'Barker', 'become', 'animal', 'rights', 'activist', 'would', ""n't"", 'clear', 'show', 'even', 'BCI', 'makers', 'collection', 'agreed', 'add', 'disclaimer', 'think', 'have', 'side', 'Bob', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'show', 'historical', 'purposes', 'make', 'look', 'hypocrite.Missing', 'models', 'decades', 'Barker', 'beauties', 'have', 'beefs', 'other', 'admitted', 'affair', 'had', 'Dian', 'Parkinson', 'who', 'sued', '8', 'million', 'afterwards', 'Holly', 'Holstrom', 'sued', 'unlawful', 'termination', 'when', 'was', 'fired', '1995', 'being', 'overweight', 'got', 'money', 'settlement', 'was', 'reportedly', 'millions', 'Janice', 'Kathleen', 'were', 'let', 'go', '2000', 'mainly', 'testified', 'Holly', 'lawsuit', 'Barker', 'sided', 'Holly', 'supposedly', 'were', 'paid', 'severence', 'package', 'agreement', 'not', 'sue', '80s', '90s', 'shows', 'featured', 'models', 'mentioned', 'Apparently', 'Barker', ""n't"", 'want', 'models', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'Janice', 'featured', 'was', 'first', 'show', 'Diane', 'hour-long', 'show', 'Holly', 'Kathleen', 'set.No', 'Rod', 'Roddy', 'Bob', 'reportedly', 'got', 'mad', 'Rod', 'when', 'Rod', 'went', 'negotiate', 'models', 'salary', 'nighttime', 'specials', 'should', 'be', 'equal', 'not', 'more', 'daytime', 'show', 'Bob', 'cut', 'Rod', 'on-camera', 'time', 'show', 'excuse', 'given', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'show', 'announcers', 'camera', 'Rod', 'not', 'featured', 'collection.Other', 'collection', 'how', 'present', 'day', 'TPIR', 'evolved', 'friendly', 'sometimes', 'unpolished', 'show', 'slick', 'smooth', 'show', 'today', 'Barker', 'last', 'week', 'included', 'Bill', 'Cullen', 'shows', 'are', 'great', 'treat', 'as', 'well', 'Yes', 'was', 'TPIR', 'back', '50s', '60s', 'Cullen', 'prove', 'hear', 'Johnny', 'O', 'say', 'Come', 'down', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'who', 'made', 'phrase', 'famous']",The Best of The Price is Right

But, that doesn't mean that The Price is Right remained the same. It still has shown for over 35 years on CBS, that the show still is as popular as ever. This past year, comedian and host of The Power Of 10, Drew Carey took over the reigns as the host, while the original legend, Bob Barker, retired after an astronomical 50 years on television. But, now the game show is finally making it on the DVD makret. After other game shows from the Mark Goodson Productions catalog have dominated the past few years like Match Game with Gene Rayburn, and the recently released All-Star Family Feud with their original host Richard Dawson made it to home video, how does The Price Is Right stand out, here is the actual retail price.The Best Of The Price Is Right is a 4 disc DVD that showcase some of The Price Is Right's beginnings and ends of a generation with Bob Barker. The compilation primarily focuses in on the CBS game shows first and last shows Bob hosted. The collection includes the very few shows when Bob hosted the show back in 1972, when they first offered cars like a Chevrolet Vega worth $2,746, all the way to his final week of shows from June 11th - June 15th 2007. The shows have all been remastered from top to bottom. But, Bob isn't the only person as host on this DVD set, as an added bonus for original fans, the collection features very rare episodes of the very first version of The Price Is Right with Bill Cullen all the way back in the 50's and 60's when it was on NBC. Those shows mark a rare treat for what influenced the long-running game show, and what has delivered for so many years.While there are a lot of Price Is Right fans that feel very dissapointed that there are so many episodes that haven't made it to DVD, The Best Of The Price Is Right works as a great sampler for die hard Price Is Right fans, and for anyone who hasn't even yet seen a glimpse of Bob Barker saying to help control the pet population. All that I can hope for is that there is more one volume of this great game show on home video sometime soon. That price should be right without going over.DVD Cover: B+Shows: B-Price: BRemastering: BOverall: B 1/2-",4,"Bob Barker, Come On Down!!!",1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,2335,"['doubt', 'when', 'down', 'game', 'shows', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'remained', 'only', 'constant', 'television', 'many', 'other', 'game', 'shows', 'have', 'came', 'gone', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Price', 'Right', 'remained', 'same', 'still', 'shown', '35', 'years', 'CBS', 'show', 'still', 'as', 'popular', 'ever', 'past', 'year', 'comedian', 'host', 'Power', '10', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'took', 'over', 'reigns', 'host', 'original', 'legend', 'Bob', 'Barker', 'retired', 'astronomical', '50', 'years', 'television', 'now', 'game', 'show', 'finally', 'making', 'DVD', 'makret', 'other', 'game', 'shows', 'Mark', 'Goodson', 'Productions', 'catalog', 'have', 'dominated', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Match', 'Game', 'Gene', 'Rayburn', 'recently', 'released', 'All-Star', 'Family', 'Feud', 'original', 'host', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'made', 'home', 'video', 'how', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'stand', 'out', 'here', 'actual', 'retail', 'price.The', 'Best', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', '4', 'disc', 'DVD', 'showcase', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'beginnings', 'ends', 'generation', 'Bob', 'Barker', 'compilation', 'primarily', 'CBS', 'game', 'shows', 'first', 'last', 'shows', 'Bob', 'hosted', 'collection', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'when', 'Bob', 'hosted', 'show', 'back', '1972', 'when', 'first', 'offered', 'cars', 'Chevrolet', 'Vega', '2,746', 'way', 'final', 'week', 'shows', 'June', '11th', 'June', '15th', '2007', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'top', 'bottom', 'Bob', ""n't"", 'only', 'person', 'host', 'DVD', 'set', 'added', 'bonus', 'original', 'fans', 'collection', 'very', 'rare', 'episodes', 'very', 'first', 'version', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'Bill', 'Cullen', 'way', 'back', '50', '60', 'when', 'was', 'NBC', 'shows', 'mark', 'rare', 'treat', 'what', 'influenced', 'long-running', 'game', 'show', 'delivered', 'so', 'many', 'years.While', 'are', 'lot', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'fans', 'feel', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'DVD', 'Best', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'great', 'sampler', 'die', 'hard', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'yet', 'seen', 'glimpse', 'Bob', 'Barker', 'saying', 'help', 'control', 'pet', 'population', 'can', 'hope', 'more', 'one', 'volume', 'great', 'game', 'show', 'home', 'video', 'sometime', 'soon', 'price', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'going', 'over.DVD', 'Cover', 'B+Shows', 'B-Price', 'BRemastering', 'BOverall', 'B', '1/2-']",The Best of The Price is Right

1134703,A1NXBAHHSY1D0W,B00125JPN0,Ronald A. Giofu,"[2, 5]","This four-disc DVD is tremendous. We get the roots of the show with Bill Cullen and the black haired Bob Barker from his early episodes. Tremendous! Seeing '70s celebrities like Charles Nelson Reilly and Bert Convy help plug the show's expansion into one-hour is fun.While there aren't as many games in the early Barker years (get ready for a lot of ""The Grocery Game""), it's still a lot of fun to watch. I get a kick out of seeing cars that cost $2-4,000 and seeing Johnny Olsen acting in the Showcase Showdown.One drawback is the selection of episodes. The Barker era skips from 1972-1975 time period to his last week in 2007. Not on this set are any shows from the 1980s or 1990s. Certainly there are many moments (like Vanna White as a contestant, the lady fainting, the contestant in the bathroom etc.) that would be great to see again. Skipping those decades, unfortunately, means Rod Roddy announced shows aren't there.What is on this set is gold and is well worth the money. What isn't there is worthy of additional ""Best of Price is Right"" volumes.

I agree with most of the reviews here, I'm disapointed they didn't include bloppers and outtakes. But the episodes from 1972 to 1975 are fantastic fun to see . It is well worth the bargin price to see these  vintage 70's episodes and the quality is perfect. It looks like they filmed it yesterday! The very cool retro prizes like a 73 VW, 70's clothes and hairdos are loads of fun and laughs! Bob Barker was always so handsome and smooth, it's fun seeing him in the beginning. He always had the magic touch. I do miss hearing him say ""Have your pets spayed and neutered."" Long time beautiful prize model Janis Pennington who was a 1971 Playboy Playmate, was there from the start.  Maybe someday they will release a bigger collection with more episodes from the late 70's and early 80's to the late 80s on DVD with all the crazy contestents, but for now this is fun to see.

Call me weird, but for the past 5 years or so I've searched the web for TPIR sites hoping to see early episodes of the show. With The Price Is Right being into its 36th continuous year on the air, I never thought I'd see as much as rerun of a previous episode. And now here I am watching a younger, dark-haired Bob Barker being introduced on a 1972 episode of The NEW Price Is Right - and all I can say is WOW!!!!!It's no wonder The Price Is Right has been on TV for so long. An episode from over 30 years ago is just as exciting as a current episode (before Bob retired, of course). This DVD set is a treasure! It contains 4 episodes of the 1950's and early 1960's shows hosted by Bill Cullen. The rest is all classic Bob Barker shows from 1972, 73, 74, 75 and Bob's entire final week as host. You also get the very first hour-long show with the Showcase Showdown. All the famous pricing games and memorable contestants are here as well as the opening cards and ticket plugs.If you are a true Price Is Right fan, YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO OWN THIS DVD SET!!!And thanks to Amazon.com for shipping it to me so quickly!

1134707,AI7KBBGYYCFX6,B00125JPN0,W. Budris,"[11, 15]","As a devotee of the 35 Year ""Price Is Right"" since Day One, I was a bit disappointed in this set, as when I watched, I thought I had missed something.  From Disc 3, you jump from the first Nov 1975 hour show to Disc 4 and the final 5 daytime episodes.  There is a lot missing.I am grateful to BCI for including 4 episodes of the original ""Price Is Right"" with Bill Cullen, as I grew up on this version.  Glad that a daytime episode and the fantasic more-opulant prize evening editions (giving away new homes) are included, especially the very last nighttime ""Price"" from 1964 where a celebrity was on the panel and played for people in the audience.I feel that who put this together stayed heavily with the first season in 1972-73.  One rare thing you never see now is a half-filled audience.  I would figure in respect for Bob Barker, the first episode aired is not included, because the first item up for bids was a fur coat.  However, most of the episodes selected always had the first incarnation of the Grocery Game constantly.  Would have liked to have seen more variety.  Inclusion of the original ""Bullseye - 7 Bid"" game for a car, plus the two-contestant version were a must to show.  However, no reference to the current Bullseye game (one of my favorites).  I am glad that the special hour anniversary week that proceeded the conversion to an hour format was included.  The original wheel was a hoot!  Having the official first hour show is also a plus.  What happened to 1976 through May 2007?  If it were possible,  this could have been a 5-disc set.  A full disc of Bill Cullen on Disc 1 depending on how many original Price shows were available (seeing some on Game Show Network during Black & White Nights over the years showed ""some"", but doubt the entire series is available).  Disc 2 should be ""Early Years"" from 1972-75 in the half hour format, with the evolution of the show and several games past and present.Disc 3 could've been one of the Anniversary Week one-hour shows, the first hour show, then a best of the later 70's hour shows.  Disc 4 representing the 80s, 90s and 2000.  Disc 5 to include 2001 - 2007, with the Bob's 50th in TV Anniversary Special, the 30th Anniversary show taped in Vegas (I was there for that one) and the very last daytime show, vs. the full final week.Also missing....bonus features.  The only surprise bonus I found was they left in a Beano commercial, as well as advising how to order tickets for the new Drew Carey episodes.  Where was an interview with past contestants you could find?  Bloopers?  Models then and now?  Something on Roger Dobkowitz and his involvement all these years?  Retired games that worked and didn't work (Hurdles for one that always broke down).If they proceed with a Best Of Volume 2, I hope they include the complete shows with the woman who lost her top coming on down, the woman who won the first Grand game and chased Bob all over the set, the complete show with Ethel who had the dream about Bob in the hayloft, and other gems.  Greatest wins should also be considered with two that come to mind...the closest Showcase bid being $5 from the actual price, and an episode where two woman were $30 and $29 away from the actual price creating a double-showcase winner regardless.  Would be nice to see who the first double-showcase winner was, who the highest scoring Plinko player is, the guy who gave up $5000 on the Punchboard to win $10000 right after, and who was the first highest amount daytime winner ever.You will like what you see, but it could be better.
