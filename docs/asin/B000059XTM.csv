575219,A4VH04TA14CPE,B000059XTM,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[12, 15]","In 1992, Leos Carax's career as a film-maker seemed to be over. His film ""Lovers On The Bridge,"" a collection of visual and sensory extremes that took years to complete and bankrupted three producers in the process, received uniformly bad reviews and failed at the box office. No one wanted to work with Carax or sponsor any more of his work.Carax disappeared. According to later interviews, he spent much of the nineties in the Balkans, observing the various wars there up close. Then, in 1999, he suddenly filmed ""Pola X,"" an adaptation of Melville's bizarre novel ""Pierre, Or The Ambiguities."" His return sparked some interest, but critics hated ""Pola X"" about as much as ""Lovers On The Bridge."" No surprise there -- ""Pola X"" is even more maximalist and emotional than its predecessor. It's not a ""comeback."" In this film, Carax so clearly doesn't care if anyone is listening that one can't help but admire him.Unlike ""Lovers On The Bridge,"" where the plot had a very strong realistic underpinning at its core, ""Pola X"" is contrived from beginning to end, like the book it's based on. But it is a very impressive and intense film. Objectively, ""Lovers On The Bridge"" might be ""better,"" but ""Pola X"" has a way of forcing one's admiration.Leading man Guillaume Depardieu is the film's biggest strength. Carax's films tend to draw more attention to their director than to their actors, so it may be easy to overlook Depardieu's performance, but it is actually very strong. Like all of Carax's protagonists, Depardieu's character is desperate and obsessed. But Carax's previous favourite actor Denis Lavant always seemed to get some kind of smug self-gratification from exhibiting his pain, whereas Depardieu looks like he's credibly suffering from his mania. This makes a big difference. ""Pola X"" might be the first Carax film where the protagonist's desperation is genuinely affecting.Unfortunately, the leading lady is the film's biggest weakness. Katerina Golubeva, as Pierre's long-lost half-sister, is insufferable. She has a huge monologue in one scene where she drones on, and on, and on, in a heavy monotone voice. This is the entire range exhibited by her character. She only talks in this shrill, harsh tone. And she does a lot of wide-eyed, helpless staring. This aspect of the film is not necessarily Carax's fault -- the monologue and the characterization come directly from the source material -- but it's still very irritating. As befits a Carax film, her character is hopelessly selfish, and can think of nothing better to do than to curse her lover for no apparent reason even as he's going mad.The other actors, however, are all quite good. Delphine Chuillot reminds me of Julie Delpy from ""Bad Blood,"" and actually her character is pretty much identical to that one. She's the saintly, long-suffering Carax heroine, but she has the good grace to suffer quietly and look innocent and pretty. And she makes an actual sacrifice for Pierre, as opposed to Isabelle, who is incapable of doing anything other than dragging him further down.In ""Pola X,"" there is a sense that Carax has detached himself from his protagonist, and no longer views romantic excess as something glamorous and wonderful. This can be perceived in the scene between Pierre and his publisher. She tells him that his earlier, immature writing was superior to his latest work, precisely because it was in some sense more honest. Pierre is an immature young man, and it is beyond his ability to find any kind of deep, original truth about life, much less shock someone with it. This is echoed later, when Pierre receives a rejection letter that characterizes his writing as ""a raving morass which reeks of plagiarism."" This is very interesting. If it had merely said ""raving morass,"" then we might be inclined to think that Pierre's writing is actually brilliant, and the world has cruelly misunderstood him. But the part about plagiarism suggests that the publisher may be right.Pierre even says something to this effect, addressing Isabelle: ""I thought I could give you everything, but I have nothing."" It's presumptuous to try to read into the director's motives, but Carax might be saying something about himself here. If he spent much of the nineties observing wars, he may have come to find the hip romanticism of his early films to be inadequate. Such a line certainly never appears in any of those films.Carax's long absence has only improved his visual style. ""Pola X"" has less expensive visuals than ""Lovers On The Bridge,"" but it rivals the earlier film in grandeur. The brief opening montage of a wartime bombing raid is arguably Carax's most effective image. It's vastly superior to Godard's attempts at something similar in his last film ""Notre Musique.""The warehouse is also very impressive, in some way even more than the Pont-Neuf from ""Lovers On The Bridge."" Like the depiction of Bastille Day in that film, the warehouse scenes combine visuals and sound to great effect. The camera pans over the rusty, forbidding set, while a bunch of stern-faced guys (apparently extremists of some sort) play gloomy, rhythmic music. It's kind of ridiculous, the way Carax sticks this weird industrial band into the set for no apparent reason, but at the same time it somehow reflects and illustrates Pierre's increasingly demented, warped condition. The camera lingers on the rust on the walls and the sharp corners. So, even if the plot of the film makes no sense, at least it's possible to believe it on its own terms while one is watching the film.If ""Pola X"" is really Carax's last film, it's a strong conclusion to an unfortunately short career. But, as recently as 2006, there have been rumours that Carax has started work on a new film. Will we see him again?",4,"Intense and feverish, like Carax's best work.",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,5754,"['1992', 'Leos', 'Carax', 'career', 'film-maker', 'seemed', 'be', 'over', 'film',

Motorcycles on winding roads it may have, but these roads are not called &quot;Middle.&quot;This film, brought to us by the same man who brought us the intense, passionate, uncomfortable film The Lovers on the Bridge in 1991, revisits some of the same territory of that film here. There is Desperation. Lust. Love. Blindness. Sight. Darkness. Light. Prosperity. Intense Poverty. Artists. Their Art. The Loss of that Art. The Incredible Need to Recapture It. Hunger. Satisfaction. Illness. Life. Death. Pain. Loss. Intense joy. Bitterness. Jealousy. Regret. All in all, the ingredients of what makes a Great, with a capital G Great, film.Pola X has a light side and an incredibly dark and desolate one. The film starkly separates these sunny and shadowy pieces of our hero's life into two main segments. First we see the light. When the film opens, we meet Guillaume Depardieu, in his beautiful villa, with his beautiful mother, and his beautiful fiance. Next to all this is a beautiful little computer, next to which lies his beautiful little book, which he wrote when even younger, and which he became instantly famous for writing, a sort of cult figure. He is a beautiful young man who has everything. Except his writing, except his muse. Because he has reached a point in his life where everything is so stable and 'flat' that he is beginning to have trouble writing, creating, producing. And this is nagging at him, slightly, like a small child tugging softly at his arm for a piece of candy or a pat on the head. For a while, though, he is happy. Happy smoking a cigarette with his beautiful mother on the lovely sun-dappled lawn, and making love to his fiance with quiet passion in her young room in her own house. Happy with these creatures of light, these creatures which cannot see into him, into his dark self, his true self, his strong, artistic, belligerent self which is knocking at his door, waiting to be let out.All of this changes when he begins having dreams of a mysterious stranger, who is somehow familiar to him. Then, when in town one day with a friend, he sees a woman, a woman who somehow resembles the woman in his dream. She is following him. He follows her. They find each other. What happens next begins a gigantic odyssey of obsession, artistic fervor, dark secrets and their telling, and a manic intensity which takes our young hero, and all those around him and unravels them, slowly, one thread at a time....This is riveting, fascinating French cinema. It asks, among other questions, which is more important: Art, or Life? Without a middle ground to choose from, our hero embarks on a desparate, driven attempt to find his Voice. As he peels off all the layers of familiarity and comfort, all health and future plans, in the name of writing again, he starts a slow, solid spin out of control, and ends up almost at the point of death. A must-have for every serious (intense) cinema lover. A raw, exorcising cinematic experience.

I gave it to my boyfriend, who did read it, and then told me about this movie. I found it VERY helpful to watch this movie with someone who had read Pierre, since it fills in some gaps for the characters' motives which isn't at all obvious in the film.Basic, basic plot: Young man is in love, also kind of sketchy dynamic with his mom. Meets woman who claims to be his half-sister. He decides to abandon his secure life to run off with her, and the results are not good.Guillaume Depardieu, as well as the two female supporting characters in the form of his girlfriend and the half-sister, do their best in a movie that is just a little too difficult to follow without a knowledge of what Melville had in mind. Catherine Deneuve isn't in the movie enough - she is powerful, beautiful, and absolutely packs in the psychological compulsion that make her scenes the most fun in a mostly humorless movie.Guillaume Depardieu died a week ago. I am sure that his father, Gerard, was proud of him, but I would have been particularly so given his ability to take on such a potentially ridiculous screenplay and bring it closer to the psychological turmoil that comes across more obviously in the original book.recommended for: arthouse freaks who would like everyone to know that they also read Melville.p.s.

575227,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B000059XTM,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[33, 55]","Leos Carax's &quot;Pola X&quot; is at best problematic and at worst an incoherent mess.  It is rumored that Herman Melville went insane while writing &quot;Pierre: or the Ambiguities&quot; on which this film is based. This explains a lot in regards to what we are forced to endure while watching this film.  Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu, Gerard's son)is a good-looking, blond, rich author living with his sister, Marie (Catherine Denueve who manages somehow to keep her dignity) and engaged to blond, good looking, Lucie (Delphine Chuillot).  While having a beer with his cousin (Laurent Lucas who is always dewy-eyed for some reason)one sunny afternoon, he sees a dark haired woman, Isabelle (Katerina Golubeva) spying on him and proceeds to follow her as he realizes this is the woman of whom he's been dreaming.  Up until this point the film has been about light: bright sunlight, white clothing, blond hair,etc.  But the minute Isabelle comes on the scene everything goes dark, dank and miserable. Pretty obvious symbolism.  Isabelle claims to be Pierre's long lost sister and Pierre decides to turn his life upside down and take care of Isabelle which leads him into a fast spiral downward.  Golubeva's recitation regarding her previous life and her delivery of it in an irritating voice that sounds like a young, drunk Marlene Dietrich is one of THE most irritating scenes in movies that I have ever been unfortunate to witness.

Well, there you have it in a nutshell.  You can almost put everything on a bumper sticker or a t-shirt:  Life sucks and then you die!  It's easier to read those six little words than to slog through this pretentious never ending movie.  I guess there is no joy in life to these europeans.

I felt badly that this young man's Bosnian half-sister had suffered so much brutality in the war.  However, she did not have to inflict her pain upon her half brother.  Her misery and numbness and the brother's willingess to wallow in this misery and numbness destroys both of them in the end.They both would have been better off having several sessions with a good shrink.  The half-brother could probably afford to hire the most expensive shrinks available.  That kid was rolling in dough!I am not a prude or I wouldn't have rented this movie in the first place.  However, the totally explicit sexual scenes were not exactly necessary and not really even sexy, just rather cold and clinical. (And to be honest, closeups of aroused genitals are not always the prettiest sights around.)It was impossible to empathize with anyone in this film because everyone in this movie was completely self-absorbed, leadenly serious, and joylessly masochistic.  About an hour into this movie, I longed to watch a Looney Tunes cartoon so that I could be reminded that there is such a thing as humor and fun.The only good thing about this movie was the acting and the photography which were both outstanding.

575231,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000059XTM,Trevor Willsmer,"[5, 5]","Pola X is at once the most accessible and least interesting film from infant terrible Leos Carax. His modernised adaptation of Herman Melville's Pierre, or The Ambiguities is certainly less disjointed than his other features, but it lacks the inspired standout moments that make them worth watching even if they don't entirely work. If you're expecting something like the joyful sequence set to David Bowie's When I Live My Dream in Boy Meets Girl you'll be bitterly disappointed: this is a joyless film that wanders into unintentional self-parody without ever providing much to smile about. This is self-conscious Miserablism in the classic tradition.It starts out as glacially classical French film-making before moving more into better photographed nouvelle vague with all the usual clich&eacute;s - self-indulgent disaffected hero (Guillaume Depardieu) flirting with ill-defined violent politics in the pursuit of an equally ill-defined truth while constantly lying to himself; utterly hopeless leading lady (Katerina Golubeva) that either producer or director wants to have sex with delivering a pitifully bad and painfully stilted performance; 'daring' unsimulated sex scene (albeit featuring body doubles); clumsy symbolism and a bleak-chic ending you don't need to have read the book to see coming. There's an interesting note of criticism in the anti-hero's search for truth in poverty and his need to increasingly create a fiction to support his self-image (he persuades his sister to pose as his wife and his fianc&eacute; to pose as his sister and while desperate for money constantly refuses to touch the money he and his family have) and it earns Brownie points for its attitude to racism in France, but it's not quite enough. Jacques Rivette declared it the best French film of the last ten years, but I guess that just implies he doesn't see many French films these days.",2,Surprisingly conventional and joyless for Carax,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1887,"['Pola', 'X', 'once', 'most', 'accessible', 'least', 'interesting', 'film', 'infant', 'terrible', 'Leos', 'Carax', 'modernised', 'adaptation', 'Herman', 'Melville', 'Pierre', 'Ambiguities', 'certainly', 'less', 'disjointed', 'other', 'features', 'inspired', 'standout', 'moments', 'make', 'watching', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'work', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'something', 'joyful', 'sequence', 'set', 'David', 'Bowie', 'When', 'Live', 'Dream', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'Girl', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'joyless', 'film', 'wanders', 'unintentional', 'self-parody', 'ever', 'providing', 'much', 'smile', 'about', 'self-conscious', 'Miserablism', 'classic', 'tradition.It', 'out', 'glacially', 'classical', 'French', 'film-making', 'moving', 'more', 'better', 'photographed', 'nouvelle', 'vague', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'self-indulgent', 'disaffected', 'hero', 'Guillaume', 'Depardieu', 'flirting', 'ill-defined', 'violent', 'politics', 'pursuit', 'equally', 'ill-defined', 'truth', 'constantly', 'lying', 'utterly', 'hopeless', 'leading', 'lady', 'Katerina', 'Golubeva', 'producer', 'director', 'have', 'sex', 'delivering', 'pitifully', 'bad', 'painfully', 'stilted', 'performance', ""'daring"", 'unsimulated', 'sex', 'scene', 'featuring', 'body', 'doubles', 'clumsy', 'symbolism', 'bleak-chic', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'coming', 'interesting', 'note', 'criticism', 'anti-hero', 'search', 'truth', 'poverty', 'need', 'increasingly', 'create', 'fiction', 'support', 'self-image', 'sister', 'pose', 'wife', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'pose', 'sister', 'desperate', 'money', 'constantly', 'touch', 'money', 'family', 'have', 'Brownie', 'points', 'attitude', 'racism', 'France', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'Jacques', 'Rivette', 'declared', 'best', 'French', 'film', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'guess', 'just', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'French', 'films', 'days']",Pola X
