1524819,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B0072HTWQM,Jon Wynne,"[2, 2]","A number of outstanding programs from Denmark and Sweden have become available in North America over the past few years. Shows like Wallander and The Killing have been enormous hits, to the point where they have been re-made in either England or the U.S. This is understandable as many viewers just don't like subtitles. Accessibility is what it's all about in the film business. Appeal to as wide an audience as possible.But for this reviewer, there is nothing like the original. Having recently enjoyed a number of European programs, many made available here in North America by a company called MHz Networks, who specialize in such programming, I've become hooked, waiting for that next great show to come along. After Borgen, the three season political masterpiece that came out of Denmark just a few years ago, it's been both fun to anticipate what that show might be and frustrating to watch shows that, while good, aren't quite up to the high standard set by Borgen.Well, THE BRIDGE comes awfully close to being that elusive next masterpiece. A co-production between Sweden and Denmark, this ten-part police procedural derives a lot of its dramatic power by setting the first murder at the precise point on the Oresund Bridge that divides Denmark from Sweden. Who is in charge is the first obvious question asked. The answer, both countries. While most of the office scenes are set in Sweden, with Saga Noren (played by Sofia Helin), the leading homicide detective in the Swedish city of Malmo apparently in control of the investigation, the Danish presence is more than adequately represented by Martin Rohde (played by Kim Bodnia) Copenhagen's leading homicide detective.As good as the plot is, and as thrilling as some heart-stopping moments are, the real thrust of the series is the interaction between the socially inept, cut-to-the-bone truthfulness of Saga and the more laid-back, family man Martin. As radically different as they are from one another, Saga and Martin are by no means one dimensional characters and their life decisions, their values and their ability to separate blatant truth from, at times, more appropriately sensitive responses, is one of the most compulsively watchable aspects of THE BRIDGE. The title of the show also comes to stand as a metaphor for how these two characters will bridge their differences and learn to work together.The style and look of the series is also important to note. Lovers of old films continue to watch Film Noir with the sort of veneration the best of that genre deserves. Where are the heirs apparent today? Right here in shows like THE BRIDGE, which is mostly shot at night and carries with it a gloom and oppression that seems inescapable, all basic qualities of Film Noir.There is a lot of darkness in ten hours of relentless murder investigation. Be warned that the show's world view isn't exactly life affirming. But it is not a world without hope. Central to that hope is the idea that a healthy domestic relationship is the most important aspect of life. While many of us might say there is a little more to living than that, important as such things are, in the dramatic world of THE BRIDGE, this is most appropriate, at least for now. Relational respite from the worries of the world are high stakes indeed.Apparently, season two of THE BRIDGE has been produced and a third is being written. Maybe the characters' respective world views will mature and grow...Meantime, don't be put off by the subtitles. THE BRIDGE is worth the time and effort.",5,How Swede it is!

1524821,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0072HTWQM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","The intriguing Scandinavian crime series ""The Bridge"" starts out with an absolutely killer premise and builds a complex multi-layered narrative that constantly surprises.  In the initiating episode, a body is dumped (quite elaborately, I might add) on the bridge that connects Denmark with Sweden.  One half of the body is on each side of the border.  Cool, huh?  Even more twisted, there are really two corpses that are pieced together for this rather macabre spectacle.  One is a prominent figure in Swedish politics and the other is a long missing prostitute from Denmark.  Just what is the killer trying to say?  Are his ultimate motives political or are they personal?  That's exactly what the lead investigators have to determine as they play an increasingly perplexing series of cat-and-mouse games with the person responsible.  There seems to be a social statement at work (the inequality of the justice system, the apathy for the plight of the homeless and disconnected) but surely this stems from some sort of originating event that must be uncovered.At this point, you might be saying ""Wait, I think I've seen something quite like this already!""  And, indeed, you might have.  Season One of the original Scandinavian series aired in 2011 and was already adapted into an Americanized version for the FX network starring Diane Kruger and Damien Birchir in 2013.  (A second season of this Swedish/Danish iteration also aired in its native lands in 2013, and I'm eagerly awaiting its availability).  I actually watched the American version prior to going back to this one, and the two are structured very similarly.  The FX drama is set on the tumultuous border between El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, so there is the topical addition of the illegal immigrant debate factored into the discussion.  And part of the pleasure in the show (either one) is to see the variations within the two cultures, in both their politics and their priorities.""The Bridge"" throws a lot of characters at you and is more complex than a traditional crime show.  The first episodes introduce three different plot threads.  In addition to the primary investigation, there are also storylines that follow a wife whose wealthy husband is in need of a heart transplant and an enigmatic social worker who seems to be helping women in trouble for personal reasons of his own.  It's fascinating to see how these disparate stories get closer as the action progresses.  But at the heart of the show are the cops in charge, Saga Nor&eacute;n (a great Sofia Helin) from Sweden and Martin Rohde (an equally effective Kim Bodnia) from Denmark.  Helin's character is no-nonsense and relentless, but lacks a filter or normal social behaviors due to Aspergers Disorder.  Bodnia (who never stopped reminding me of Louis CK) takes a more casual approach, but also gets results.  The two play off each other extremely well and, as they form a mutual respect, they provide quite a bit of humor as well.  I also liked unscrupulous journalist Daniel Ferb&eacute; (Christian Hillborg) who dubs the master criminal with the moniker of the ""truth terrorist.""""The Bridge"" is a rewarding show for adults that continues to build suspense and surprises as it progresses.  It is exceedingly well acted, and the central pairing works tremendously.  Of course, the show does suffer from the traditional cliches of most serial killer stories.  Everything is so elaborate and over-the-top, we once again are dealing with an absolute genius and a masterful planner and technician.  Why are serial killers so darn smart in popular entertainment?  But I was willing to go along for the ride, and really loved this show.  The DVD release consists of 10 hour long episodes, but not much in the way of bonus material.  There a bit of behind-the-scenes interviews, but nothing too substantial.  If you like intricate mysteries, I highly recommend ""The Bridge.""

Usually a loved character is not found murdered in the last scene.I was left bummed out, depressed for more than two days. That's why this warning: get your defenses up.I cannot speculate why the writers did this to us, showing extreme suffering, then the loss of someone we'd grown to like a lot (the Danish detective's son). I won't even try. But, I object. Traumatizing your audience -- in an otherwise good story* -- should not be allowed.*There were several, notably one in particular, red herrings, such as the strangestrange man Anya, the runway, stays with, which, I thought, were NOT integrated into the plot but left too many questions. The new characters came on as if they were new stories entirely. Earlier main characters just fall away. As they do in real life?The characters, Martin and the Aspergersish  Saga, are consistent, and interesting.I was looking forward to series 2 but, if they are going to treat us this way, killing a character without even any scenes or time taken for a funeral, to see the effects on his whole family, to give them and us rituals for mourning, is cold.

1524826,ADBAJLF1ZJ0TB,B0072HTWQM,Mikey,"[3, 3]","Appealing to nearly 2 million weekly viewers, The Bridge (Swedish - Bron) (Danish - Broen) aired in the autumn of 2011 every Wednesday night at 8pm in Denmark and 9pm in Sweden. Danish network DR screened episodes a week after their Swedish SVT counterparts before the Danes caught up by screening a double episode to conclude on the same night as SVT.The Bridge is probably best described as a mixture of three recent popular Scandinavian acquisitions on UK television, Wallander, The Killing and Those Who Kill. Considering that all three of these series along with Danish political drama Borgen are all set within an hours journey of each other in the &Ouml;resund/resund (S/D) region, The Bridge should have something to appeal to fans of all Nordic series.Unlike the other Danish shows, you won't find many actors from the other programmes here with the exception of the lead male Danish policeman played by Kim Bodnia (guest appearances in The Killing 1 and Those Who Kill) and a very brief appearance by Nicolaj Kopernikus (Vagn - The Killing 1) as the father of a hospital patient.The discovery of a body at the exact halfway point of the Oresund Bridge leads to the arrival of the Copenhagen and Malm&ouml; police forces who decide to work together to unravel the mystery. The finding on the bridge is actually the top half of a prominent Swedish politician and the bottom half of a Danish prostitute. This discovery is only the start for a chain of events which test the resolve of Martin (Bodnia) and Saga (Sofia Helin).Both countries opted to stay out of the euro so we see Martin have to borrow some Swedish kronor from Saga while in Sweden. We also learn that as a Danish cop in Sweden, Martin is not allowed to be armed. To be fair although they both speak similar closely related languages and can understand each other nearly 100%, we learn that both Sweden and Denmark are more similar than both characters would think.The production appears to be more Swedish than Danish through my eyes and more of the scenes take place in Sweden's third biggest city than in the Danish capital. That's not to say that all is quiet in Copenhagen - police corruption, riots, the killing of an immigrant, we also see how solid the marriage of our Danish cop is. Crossing the bridge we have a very different policewoman who is quite unlike any policewoman seen before on TV. When we see Saga out of business hours is when we discover the real lady and learn about how she became the way she is today. As with other Scandinavian series we are exposed to alot of character background which makes this a very solid drama.Although DR and SVT are involved in the making of the series, independent production companies are involved too. As is standard with most DR dramas, each episode of this ten part series is around 58 minutes long and each hour spent watching this will fly by. This is certainly better than the vast majority of BBC and ITV drama output and Five and Sky's acquisitions from the US.Apparently a second series has already been commissioned which is definitely something to look forward to. In the meantime I'm going to try some Danish drama set in the FiftiesBetter Times ( Krniken ) ( Kr&ouml;nikan ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Denmark].",5,Sarah Lund meets Wallander while looking for Those Who Kill a member of Borgen(sort of),1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,3264,"['Appealing', 'nearly', '2', 'million', 'weekly', 'viewers', 'Bridge', 'Swedish', 'Bron', 'Danish', 'Broen', 'aired', 'autumn', '2011', 'Wednesday', 'night', '8pm', 'Denmark', '9pm', 'Sweden', 'Danish', 'network', 'DR', 'screened', 'episodes', 'week', 'Swedish', 'SVT', 'counterparts', 'Danes', 'caught', 'up', 'screening', 'double', 'episode', 'conclude', 'same', 'night', 'SVT.The', 'Bridge', 'probably', 'best', 'described', 'mixture', 'three', 'recent', 'popular', 'Scandinavian', 'acquisitions', 'UK', 'television', 'Wallander', 'Killing', 'Who', 'Kill', 'Considering', 'three', 'series', 'Danish', 'political', 'drama', 'Borgen', 'are', 'set', 'hours', 'journey', 'other', 'Ouml', 'resund/resund', 'S/D', 'region', 'Bridge', 'should', 'have', 'something', 'appeal', 'fans', 'Nordic', 'series.Unlike', 'other', 'Danish', 'shows', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'many', 'actors', 'other', 'programmes', 'here', 'exception', 'lead', 'male', 'Danish', 'policeman', 'played', 'Kim', 'Bodnia', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Killing', '1', 'Who', 'Kill', 'very', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Nicolaj', 'Kopernikus', 'Vagn', 'Killing', '1', 'father', 'hospital', 'patient.The', 'discovery', 'body', 'exact', 'halfway', 'point', 'Oresund', 'Bridge', 'arrival', 'Copenhagen', 'Malm', 'ouml', 'police', 'forces', 'who', 'decide', 'work', 'together', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'finding', 'bridge', 'actually', 'top', 'half', 'prominent', 'Swedish', 'politician', 'bottom', 'half', 'Danish', 'prostitute', 'discovery', 'only', 'start', 'chain', 'events', 'test', 'resolve', 'Martin', 'Bodnia', 'Saga', 'Sofia', 'Helin', 'countries', 'opted', 'stay', 'euro', 'see', 'Martin', 'have', 'borrow', 'Swedish', 'kronor', 'Saga', 'Sweden', 'also', 'learn', 'Danish', 'cop', 'Sweden', 'Martin', 'not', 'allowed', 'be', 'armed', 'be', 'fair', 'speak', 'similar', 'closely', 'related', 'languages', 'can', 'understand', 'other', 'nearly', '100', '%', 'learn', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'are', 'more', 'similar', 'characters', 'would', 'think.The', 'production', 'be', 'more', 'Swedish', 'Danish', 'eyes', 'more', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'Sweden', 'third', 'biggest', 'city', 'Danish', 'capital', 'not', 'say', 'quiet', 'Copenhagen', 'police', 'corruption', 'riots', 'killing', 'immigrant', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'solid', 'marriage', 'Danish', 'cop', 'Crossing', 'bridge', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'policewoman', 'who', 'quite', 'policewoman', 'seen', 'TV', 'When', 'see', 'Saga', 'business', 'hours', 'when', 'discover', 'real', 'lady', 'learn', 'how', 'became', 'way', 'today', 'other', 'Scandinavian', 'series', 'are', 'exposed', 'alot', 'character', 'background', 'very', 'solid', 'drama.Although', 'DR', 'SVT', 'are', 'involved', 'making', 'series', 'independent', 'production', 'companies', 'are', 'involved', 'too', 'standard', 'most', 'DR', 'dramas', 'episode', 'ten', 'part', 'series', '58', 'minutes', 'long', 'hour', 'spent', 'watching', 'will', 'fly', 'certainly', 'better', 'vast', 'majority', 'BBC', 'ITV', 'drama', 'output', 'Five', 'Sky', 'acquisitions', 'US.Apparently', 'second', 'series', 'already', 'been', 'commissioned', 'definitely', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'meantime', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'Danish', 'drama', 'set', 'FiftiesBetter', 'Times', 'Krniken', 'Kr', 'ouml', '[', 'NON-USA', 'FORMAT', 'PAL', 'Reg.0', 'Import', 'Denmark', ']']",Bridge: Series 1 Swedish Television

As in The Killing there is one male and one female lead although, as also in The Killing, the female lead investigator is the more naturally talented while the weaknesses and foibles of the male are all too clearly on show.A series of seemingly &#8216;conscience driven&#8217; murders occur the first of which is that of a Swedish politician, whose body is found straggling the border between Sweden and Denmark on the Oresund bridge, which joins the two.

The fact that the politician&#8217;s body is found half in Sweden and half in Denmark means that the police forces of both countries are forced to cooperate in solving the crime.

At all levels including the level of a social commentary told through reporters, this is a must see for those who previously liked other European detective series. This is a 10/10 for me. Cannnot wait to see series 2. Goes without saying the movie has sub titles and I watched the SBS (Australian broadcaster) version.",5,A Swedish-Danish Crime Drama - 10/10,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,1057,"['series', 'everything', 'American', 'crime', 'drama', ""n't"", 'will', 'either', 'love', 'genre', 'European', 'crime', 'drama', 'hate', 'series', 'characters', 'perspective', 'just', 'be', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'get', 'hooked', 'form', 'beginning', 'would', 'recommed', 'taking', 'entire', 'weekend', 'watch', 'ten', 'series', 'roller', 'coster', 'emotions', 'very', 'few', 'laughs', 'including', 'strong', 'commentary', 'social', 'life', 'countries', 'protaganists', 'are', 'Swedish', 'detetective', 'Saga', 'seemingly', 'autistic', 'Martin', 'Danish', 'counterpart', 'working', 'together', 'misfit', 'detectives', 'complimenting', 'other', 'skills', 'setting', 'Oresund', 'Bridge', 'crossing', 'Swedish', 'Malmo', 'Saga', 'country', 'Danish', 'Copehagen', 'levels', 'including', 'level', 'social', 'commentary', 'told', 'reporters', 'must', 'see', 'who', 'previously', 'liked', 'other', 'European', 'detective', 'series', '10/10', 'Cannnot', 'wait', 'see', 'series', '2', 'Goes', 'saying', 'movie', 'sub', 'titles', 'watched', 'SBS', 'Australian', 'broadcaster', 'version']",Bridge: Series 1 Swedish Television
1524835,A3RMEU4GNP60BM,B0072HTWQM,"Sussman ""Sussman""","[34, 39]","At the time of writing this review the product has yet to be released in United States, and my review is based on the airing of the series on BBC4 from Great Britain.The Title of this latest offering from Scandinavia refers to Oresund Bridge, which connects Copenhagen with the southern Swedish city of Malm&ouml;. The opening sequence sees the `staging' of a female body on Oresund, where one half is literally within Swedish borders while the other lies within Danish borders.Our two main protagonists in the Bridge Rohde (Danish Cop) and Nor&eacute;n (Swedish) team up against a self-righteous serial killer drawing attention to the ways in which the two countries' governments seem to neglect the poor and needy. He attaches notes to the corpses saying things such as: ""Had there been no victims, you would have found no victims."" A thoroughly engaging police drama and well worth a look. There are other side stories that seem to have no connection with the main theme, but  as the series progresses we will see a convergence of plot threads.To the main two protagonists then:We have Nor&eacute;n Saga (female Swedish Police officer) when it comes to police procedures she is professional and very competent. As soon as it comes to interacting with other people, she's lost and lacks any social skills. There is a hysterical scene in which she tries to chat up a man in a bar, displaying a pulling technique that makes The Inbetweeners look polished by comparison. Although not directly implied it is clear she has a form of Asperger's.While Martin Rohde (our laid-back Danish Police officer). He has a slightly alarming habit of massaging his groin - but has the excuse of having just undergone a vasectomy.  From a recent news article apparently Martin fulfils the national stereo type, as perceived by Swedes of Danes, he's had a lot of wives, he drinks a little too much, and he's not taking care of himself."" While Ms Saga, is seen as an odd, but stereotypical Swede, as perceived by Danes.Martin Rohde has to tread carefully in more ways than one, as he is obliged to team up with his Swedish detective Saga Nor&eacute;n (Sofia Helin), a woman gifted with all the logical braininess of Mr Spock but with even fewer people skills. Her wide-eyed accidental rudeness quickly becomes an icing on the cake for this series. A great series that leaves us a quirky narrative and funny too boot. Not to be missed another fine offering from our Scandinavian neighbours. Please do not put off by the subtitles.UPDATE -----------------------------------------NEWS FLASH------------------------------01/12/2013Season two of Danish/Swedish crime drama The Bridge has started On BBC4 UK.
