Some films are campy on purpose others are campy by accident or circumstance; this film is neither, it needs tossing on the campy fire. No structure, no story and no social redeeming themes or scenes.The basic story; oh there is none. The dialog is, well, deplorable. Now there is a scene of a depantylated cheerleader that looks slightly better than Kathy Bates in ""About Schmidt"" (2003) but just barely. Looks like the film revolves around this sort of thing.",1,Icky Poo,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,547,"['know', 'when', 'something', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'Well', 'one', 'just', 'stopped', 'bad', 'films', 'are', 'campy', 'purpose', 'others', 'are', 'campy', 'accident', 'circumstance', 'film', 'neither', 'tossing', 'campy', 'fire', 'structure', 'story', 'social', 'redeeming', 'themes', 'scenes.The', 'basic', 'story', 'none', 'dialog', 'well', 'deplorable', 'Now', 'scene', 'depantylated', 'cheerleader', 'slightly', 'better', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Schmidt', '2003', 'just', 'barely', 'film', 'sort', 'thing']",Cheerleader Ninjas

Low budget means better movies in many cases and this is no exception. No high tech special effects or well rehearsed dialogue here. Recommend as long as you are not easily offended by adult themes.

Now, don't think I ever considered the possibility this could be a good movie. No, I knew it would be bad, but I was hoping it would fit into the so-bad-it's-good category.It doesn't.Instead, it fits squarely into the it's-so-bad-it's-awful category.Cheerleader Ninjas is a story about a flamingly-gay teacher at a Catholic reform school who wants to get revenge on a cheerleader troupe in a nearby high school. It would seem he was refused admittance to their team. So he gets a group of reformed Catholic prostitutes to beat the crap out of the cheerleaders. The cheerleaders retaliate by getting martial arts training and reluctantly join forces with the local nerds. Terrible fight scenes, gratuitous nudity, and a giant robot/dildo battle ensue.The only thing this movie has going for it are the boobs, and that just doesn't float my boat. There are better movies out there with boobies, and it's frightening to think that Corey Haim and Corey Feldman flicks are some of these better movies.The apparent film budget would have been just enough to rent a few of 'em, too, and maybe get a couple of six-packs, while the director was at it",1,Yuck,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,1188,"['other', 'night', 'watched', 'Cheerleader', 'Ninjas', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'considered', 'possibility', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'No', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'fit', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'category.It', ""doesn't.Instead"", 'squarely', ""it's-so-bad-it's-awful"", 'category.Cheerleader', 'Ninjas', 'story', 'flamingly-gay', 'teacher', 'Catholic', 'reform', 'school', 'who', 'get', 'revenge', 'cheerleader', 'troupe', 'nearby', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'seem', 'was', 'refused', 'admittance', 'team', 'group', 'reformed', 'Catholic', 'beat', 'crap', 'cheerleaders', 'cheerleaders', 'retaliate', 'getting', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'reluctantly', 'join', 'forces', 'local', 'nerds', 'Terrible', 'fight', 'scenes', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'giant', 'robot/dildo', 'battle', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'are', 'boobs', 'just', ""n't"", 'float', 'boat', 'are', 'better', 'movies', 'there', 'boobies', 'frightening', 'think', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'flicks', 'are', 'better', 'movies.The', 'apparent', 'film', 'budget', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'enough', 'rent', 'few', 'too', 'maybe', 'get', 'couple', 'six-packs', 'director', 'was']",Cheerleader Ninjas
