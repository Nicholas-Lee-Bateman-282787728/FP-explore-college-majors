1274078,AYRFLAT8VF732,B002K2KMF4,"DC_Fan_52 ""-Weasel!""","[1, 3]","First off, let me tell you what you're buying. This is the complete series, all 26 episodes on 7 disks, plus one more for the Movie, which is a retelling of the series. They come in two spindle packs, that means the disks are stacked on top of each other. There are a handful of special features including interviews with the English cast and Japanese cast, along with production sketches, clean opening and ending songs, a music video, and trailers.Ayato Kamiya is an ordinary Japanese high school student, until he is extracted out of his home town and it is revealed that all he's known is a lie set up by aliens called the Mu. With the RahXephon, he battles giant monsters called Dolems created by the Mu, and he'll save all the other humans who are still trapped by the aliens.On the technical level, this is a good show. It has good animation. Good voice acting. And if you tracked down all the plot threads, you'd see they make sense. But for me, and this is just my opinion, I never connected with these characters. Boring, unlikable characters early on, become important to the plot later, and the mildly interesting characters drop off, or never grow more.I watched the first eight episodes in quick succession, because  I was interested in what they were building. But, by Episode 18, when the series decided to start climaxing, I wasn't engaged anymore. It felt like there was nothing to lose. I didn't connect with any of the characters. Plus, most of the Dolem battles are in the sky, or out on the open ocean, so the threats never felt real. And by the time the threat got real, I wasn't caring anymore. The last stretch of episodes became a slog. This anime was an exercise in making a complex web of relationships, but not complex characters.As for accusations about RahXephon copying Eva. I think it's apples and oranges. There's a young man, an older woman, an emotionless girl, an organization, and a mind twisting ending. Did I describe Eva, or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya?To sum up, it's an Okay series, but very low on my list of series I want to watch again. I recommend finding some place to stream it, or rent it, before you commit to buying. 3-out-of-5",3,Muted,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,2185,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'tell', 'what', ""'re"", 'buying', 'complete', 'series', '26', 'episodes', '7', 'disks', 'one', 'more', 'Movie', 'retelling', 'series', 'come', 'two', 'spindle', 'packs', 'disks', 'are', 'stacked', 'top', 'other', 'are', 'handful', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'interviews', 'English', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'production', 'sketches', 'clean', 'opening', 'ending', 'songs', 'music', 'video', 'trailers.Ayato', 'Kamiya', 'ordinary', 'Japanese', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'extracted', 'home', 'town', 'revealed', 'known', 'lie', 'set', 'up', 'aliens', 'called', 'Mu', 'RahXephon', 'giant', 'monsters', 'called', 'Dolems', 'created', 'Mu', ""'ll"", 'save', 'other', 'humans', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'trapped', 'aliens.On', 'technical', 'level', 'good', 'show', 'good', 'animation', 'Good', 'voice', 'acting', 'tracked', 'down', 'plot', 'threads', ""'d"", 'see', 'make', 'sense', 'just', 'opinion', 'never', 'connected', 'characters', 'Boring', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'early', 'become', 'important', 'plot', 'later', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'characters', 'drop', 'off', 'never', 'grow', 'more.I', 'watched', 'first', 'eight', 'episodes', 'quick', 'succession', 'was', 'interested', 'what', 'were', 'building', 'Episode', '18', 'when', 'series', 'decided', 'start', 'climaxing', 'was', ""n't"", 'engaged', 'anymore', 'felt', 'was', 'nothing', 'lose', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'characters', 'most', 'Dolem', 'battles', 'are', 'sky', 'open', 'ocean', 'threats', 'never', 'felt', 'real', 'time', 'threat', 'got', 'real', 'was', ""n't"", 'caring', 'anymore', 'last', 'stretch', 'episodes', 'became', 'slog', 'anime', 'was', 'exercise', 'making', 'complex', 'web', 'relationships', 'not', 'complex', 'characters.As', 'accusations', 'RahXephon', 'copying', 'Eva', 'think', 'apples', 'oranges', 'young', 'man', 'older', 'woman', 'emotionless', 'girl', 'organization', 'mind', 'twisting', 'ending', 'Did', 'describe', 'Eva', 'Melancholy', 'Haruhi', 'Suzumiya', 'sum', 'up', 'Okay', 'series', 'very', 'low', 'list', 'series', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'recommend', 'finding', 'place', 'stream', 'rent', 'commit', 'buying', '3-out-of-5']",N/A
1274079,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B002K2KMF4,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]",RahXephon is a really cool anime. It has a lot in common with Evengelion. The whole kid uses a giant humanoid robot to change the world to the way he wants it to be thing is pretty much the story. The anime has a lot of great characters and very good animation. The voice actors are all good as well. I would give it 5 stars if there weren't as many plot holes and if it had a better ending. Other than that. This anime is a good watch riding on the soaring wings of Evangelion. I can't say Evangelion is one of my top 10 favorites or anything either. The giant robot genre isn't really my thing. But both are really good and worth seeing. I say go for it.,4,A very GOOD series,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,656,"['RahXephon', 'really', 'cool', 'anime', 'lot', 'common', 'Evengelion', 'whole', 'kid', 'giant', 'humanoid', 'robot', 'change', 'world', 'way', 'be', 'thing', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'anime', 'lot', 'great', 'characters', 'very', 'good', 'animation', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'all', 'good', 'well', 'would', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'had', 'better', 'ending', 'Other', 'anime', 'good', 'watch', 'riding', 'soaring', 'wings', 'Evangelion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Evangelion', 'one', 'top', '10', 'favorites', 'anything', 'either', 'giant', 'robot', 'genre', ""n't"", 'really', 'thing', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'worth', 'seeing', 'say', 'go']",N/A

The thing that bothered me about the show most was how it seemed the episodes didn't connect to each other.  They would end and the next one would start off at a completely different place.  I liked the animation but this show was just clustered with too many characters and ambitions that it wasn't able to carry out by the end.  Still, it was entertaining and kept me wanting more.

1274082,AMJYNF6FI9JDM,B002K2KMF4,"Saito Hajime ""My reviews are short and sweet....","[1, 3]","Over the years of researching new anime to watch, Rah Xephon was a show that kept popping up in various lists and has received a lot of praise. I had always wanted to watch it but never really got around to it but finally I found this set new on rightstuf for 20 bucks.The set itself is all the discs stacked on top of each other in 2 thick plastic cases, wrapped in a cardboard sleeve. Pretty shoddy but its the entire series and movie for a good price so I'll overlook it.I have seen a lot of people compare this series to evangelion and I must say that is pretty fair, but trust me this is a pale imitation, although it definitely sets itself apart enough to not be considered a ripoff.(If you are looking for Eva clones Aquarion is even better than this...)The story has good concepts but never really knows what its trying to do. Is it a love story? Well yeah but the tv series is very vague on that fact although the movie definitely focuses more on that aspect. Some kind of religious or thought provoking message? If it is, that message is very muddled and unclear. Is it a giant robot show? NO. If you didnt like eva but enjoyed the fights, you will really hate this because the battles range from short and strange to non-existant. There is very little character development to the show. Well, they try to have character development for certain characters but they barely see screen time and it leaves the viewer with a very cold and boring cast.There were only a couple episodes that were a bit moving.I enjoyed the overall concept of alien invaders creating their own bubble on earth where they control people and time is slower.I will say that Rah Xephon is a great sci-fi show, but all the confusion and different things that its clearly trying to do to top eva make it a huge mess in my opinion.The animation is mediocre although the actual art design is nice. Studio bones always produces some nice looking characters but they've definitely done better since, and I feel that the compilation movie almost seems that even they kinda didn't like the way the show turned out. The score was very mediocre too. especially for a show with a lot of musical themes.Overall, I didn't hate this show, but I will say that I will never re-watch it.",3,Dont believe the hype!!!
