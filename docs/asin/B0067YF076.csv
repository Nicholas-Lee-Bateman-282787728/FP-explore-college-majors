Thought provoking yet also funny -- and definitely NOT overly sentimental or maudlin (despite its subject matter).

1512897,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0067YF076,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","Travis Fine's well-meaning examination of 9/11 and two specific individuals on the day of the event is filled with good ideas and accomplished performances. It's easy to admire the more intimate and personal approach and to see the event unfold through a very focused viewpoint. And for the most part, it works well. Fine has had the good sense to cast a no-nonsense Melissa Leo is the title role, and she has an edgy energy and hands-off demeanor that keeps the film from descending too far into overt sentimentalism. I think that's why I admired the film as much as I did. It maintained a surprisingly hard edge where other movies would have opted for a different route to completely (and continually) manipulate your emotions. I mean, who doesn't well up with intense feelings just thinking about the day? I hate movies that explicitly use those pre-existing emotions to bludgeon the viewers as opposed to developing a story or characters that actually elicit genuine concern and involvement. That said, I was invested in the primary duo at the heart of ""The Space Between.""The story revolves around Leo as a airline attendant. When her flight is grounded due to the national tragedy, she finds herself responsible for an unaccompanied minor in the chaos. When the boy, who happens to be Muslim, reveals a personal connection to the event--Leo embarks to get him back to New York City despite the fact that the country is practically shut down. The two then set forth on a road trip that will push the two disparate personalities into close quarters and mutual understanding (complete with learning moments and the expected intolerance). A lot of what drives this central relationship and, indeed, the primary plot is based on huge coincidences that detract from the naturalistic storytelling. But credit Leo and an affecting Anthony Keyvan for keeping things real. The road trip concept has become such a tired idea for bringing different people together, but it still works due to the commitment of the lead performances. Of course, before all is said and done, the film will tug at your heartstrings, but it earns your emotional investment as you've come to care about the characters.Leo's character is a fascinating mess. She imbues the film with an unpredictability that it undoubtedly needed. I might be the only person in the world who thinks her Oscar-winning mama in ""The Fighter"" was completely over-the-top, but here she does what she does best. She creates a deeply flawed multi-dimensional character that is just mesmerizing. Keyvan, with his calm presence, balances the film nicely. I certainly don't think that ""The Space Between"" is a perfect film. Elements of it are too convenient, too expected, too set-up. But in reality, I didn't really mind. This was a journey worth taking and, despite my reservations, I found it to be a thoughtful and heartfelt movie. I hope it finds a broader audience on the DVD market because I think it deserves to be seen!

1512898,A1983STWIK1F27,B0067YF076,marsha janulis,"[0, 5]","Great movie, worth watching more than once. Inspiring and uplifting;  very raw but shows what kind acts we are all capable of doing.  It offers hope to the realities we face, not just on 9/11 but everyday life.  Was wishing for a more conclusive ending but this movie lets us draw are own conclusions.  The 2 main characters are so brilliantly well written and so well rounded you get to know them more and more as their journey continues.  You are pulled into their lives and they let you feel every emotion of sadness, hoplessness, kindness and hopefulness. Because these characters became so real for me, it's a future I would've liked them to have had.  It's definitly worth watching. You come away greatly moved by it and the cascading affects it has on the two central character's and those around them. I definitely agree with the issue of Montine's alcoholism or the interpretation this plays in the movie. It may be secondary to the plot line but it also show's causal affect.  I'm only speaking for myself and quite frankly feel ashamed to say this, but the Oklahoma City attack seems to have lessened, only because it did'nt have the magnitudinal affect of 9/11. As in the case of Montine and the bartender, he had no recollection of what happened on that date. Truly, the only ones that fully understand are the victims; whether you lived it or are greiving for the deceased or have been impacted closely to these events.  In the case of the character Montine, that was probably the trigger for her drinking. So in this regard too, if I could write the script for her future it would be free of alcohol and she would address the death of her husband on April 19th, 1995. For me it's worth watching again.",5,The human heart transends all!,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,1716,"['Great', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'Inspiring', 'uplifting', 'very', 'raw', 'what', 'kind', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'hope', 'realities', 'face', 'not', 'just', '9/11', 'everyday', 'life', 'Was', 'wishing', 'more', 'conclusive', 'ending', 'movie', 'draw', 'are', 'own', 'conclusions', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'well', 'written', 'so', 'well', 'rounded', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'more', 'journey', 'are', 'pulled', 'lives', 'let', 'feel', 'emotion', 'sadness', 'hoplessness', 'kindness', 'hopefulness', 'characters', 'became', 'so', 'real', 'future', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'had', 'definitly', 'worth', 'watching', 'come', 'away', 'greatly', 'moved', 'cascading', 'two', 'central', 'character', 'definitely', 'agree', 'issue', 'Montine', 'alcoholism', 'interpretation', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'secondary', 'plot', 'line', 'also', 'show', 'causal', 'affect', ""'m"", 'only', 'speaking', 'quite', 'frankly', 'feel', 'ashamed', 'say', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'attack', 'have', 'lessened', 'only', 'have', 'magnitudinal', 'affect', '9/11', 'case', 'Montine', 'bartender', 'had', 'recollection', 'what', 'happened', 'date', 'Truly', 'only', 'ones', 'fully', 'understand', 'are', 'victims', 'lived', 'are', 'greiving', 'deceased', 'have', 'been', 'impacted', 'closely', 'events', 'case', 'character', 'Montine', 'was', 'probably', 'trigger', 'drinking', 'So', 'regard', 'too', 'could', 'write', 'script', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'free', 'alcohol', 'would', 'address', 'death', 'husband', 'April', '19th', '1995', 'worth', 'watching', 'again']",Space Between

The quality of writing and direction is of such quality that the film simply flows.  I can&#8217;t remember the last character I saw Melissa Leo play, but that is because she becomes each character so completely that you forget it is her playing them. Anthony Keyvan, is in all senses, a worthy opposite for Leo; where Montine (Leo) is a neurotic mess, and a mass of contradictions, Omar is straight-forward and analytical, and exudes the sweetness and purity of youth spent in contemplation without worldliness.

Melissa Leo, plays Montine McLeod, a burned out flight attendant, working to keep body and soul together. She is charged on this day to watch 9 year old, Omar Hassan, who is on his way to a Muslim Boarding School in LA. He has just left his father, his only relative in the world, and is sad and scared of this new world. He locks himself in the plane lavatory. Montine has no patience with anyone, never mind a scared young boy. The plane is forced to land in Houston, as the 9/11 horror was discharged.  She finds Omar as he is awakens and faces an empty plane. This is where the film really starts.I would dare you to get through this film without tears. This film brings the humanity and joy back to the lives of those involved. It is not a sweet film, but a gritty face of reality, of people facing their foibles and their fears. Melissa Leo is a force to be reckoned with, what a terrific actress. The young man who plays Omar is also a terrific actor. Kudos to the entire cast.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 5]","This ""small"" but not ""independent"" film (it was produced for USA Network cable channel) is one of the first to deal with the issues of 9/11/2001 more than ten years after the tragic event. As my fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris has detailed much of the plot, I won't repeat it here. (Actually, the less you know about the details of the script in this 86-minute film, the more you will enjoy it. There are enough twists and turns that will be ""spoiled"" if you know too much. And that's what drew me in.Let me just say that Melissa Leo (the ""star"" name on the package) is an airline stewardess (with some serious personal issues - again I can't reveal them and her ""dream sequences"" at the beginning will reveal themselves later in the film) who finds herself accompanying a 10 year old Pakistani  boy (Omar) back to his father in New York City after the Twin Towers are hit on 9/11. They travel by various modes of transportations (all planes have been grounded) and make various stops on the way. Throughout their journey they learn from each other. Anthony Keyvan as Omar will find a way to get into your heart and - at times - shows more maturity than Leo's character.The DVD has no ""special Features"" - and, of course, no trailer because it was originally produced for TV. But the film stands on its own and - though the ""bonding of two different people when thrown into a difficult situation"" is a very common theme, the performances make this a small film worth seeking out.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"A post 9/11 ""road movie"" - Young Anthony Keyvan will charm you and Melissa Leo shines in her role.",1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,1513,"['small', 'not', 'independent', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'USA', 'Network', 'cable', 'channel', 'one', 'first', 'deal', 'issues', '9/11/2001', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'tragic', 'event', 'fellow', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'K.', 'Harris', 'detailed', 'much', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'here', 'Actually', 'less', 'know', 'details', 'script', '86-minute', 'film', 'more', 'will', 'enjoy', 'are', 'enough', 'twists', 'will', 'be', 'spoiled', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'drew', 'in.Let', 'just', 'say', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'star', 'name', 'package', 'airline', 'stewardess', 'serious', 'personal', 'issues', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'dream', 'sequences', 'beginning', 'will', 'reveal', 'later', 'film', 'who', 'accompanying', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Pakistani', 'boy', 'Omar', 'back', 'father', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'are', 'hit', '9/11', 'travel', 'various', 'modes', 'transportations', 'planes', 'have', 'been', 'grounded', 'make', 'various', 'stops', 'way', 'journey', 'learn', 'other', 'Anthony', 'Keyvan', 'Omar', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'heart', 'times', 'more', 'maturity', 'Leo', 'character.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'Features', 'course', 'trailer', 'was', 'originally', 'produced', 'TV', 'film', 'own', 'bonding', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'when', 'thrown', 'difficult', 'situation', 'very', 'common', 'theme', 'performances', 'make', 'small', 'film', 'seeking', 'out.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Space Between
