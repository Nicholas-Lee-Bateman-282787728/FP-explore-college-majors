847004,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B0002VEVW0,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[21, 21]","Produced in 1996, ESCAFLOWNE begins in modern-day Japan where we are introduced to Hitomi Kanzaki, an insecure, lovestruck student who has a special gift for telling fortunes using cards.  She has eyes for the handsome captain of the boy's track team, but before she can confess her feelings, Hitomi finds herself magically whisked away to a far-off planet known as Gaea.  This strange new place is filled with luscious forests and kingdoms that look as though they could have been drawn from 18th Century France, and are inhabited not only by humans, but by talking humanoid animal creatures as well!  Two young men--Van, a brash, hot-headed young prince, and Allen, a charismatically charming knight--vie for Hitomi's affections while their girlfriends, sassy cat-girl Merle and lovely Princess Millerna, become jealous of her.  As if this isn't troublesome enough, the entire world of Gaea is at war with the Zaibach Empire, led by the brooding Chief Strategos Folken, sadistically bloodthirsty commander Dilandau, and the shadowy Emperor Dornkirk.  What follows is an epic drama that unfolds in 26 episodes, as Hitomi deals with her feelings for Van and Allen and the kingdoms of Gaea band together to defeat the opposing Zaibachs.It's no wonder that this ambitious Japanese Anime series has been highly acclaimed by both reviewers and fans.  For a television-made serial, production values are spectacular.  The colors are rich and vibrant with imagination, and there are even some impressive, but subtle use of computer generated effects in various episodes.What makes ESCAFLOWNE compelling as a series, though, is its labyrinthine storyline.  Every episode built my interests, inspiring me to keep on watching, even when it sometimes slows down to concentrate on character development.  Speaking of which, the folks who inhabit this tale are psychologically complex, showcasing positive traits as well as inner demons.  Hitomi is a very confused, sometimes fickle young woman who is attracted to many people yet cannot seem to decide who she truly loves.  Van is a socially washed-up young man who has suffered traumatic experiences in childhood and as such maintains an aggressive exterior. Allen, meanwhile, is handsome, dashing, and instantly wins the hearts of every women around.  While Van and Allen seem to respect each other at the forefront, their feelings for Hitomi threatens to cause tragic tension.  Equally interesting are the scenes involving Folken and Dilandau.  The former is calm and placid, while the latter is ever-ready to display aggressiveness.The action sequences are skillfully choreographed, namely the ones where the titular mechanical giant--Escaflowne--an impressively customized suit of armor, squares off against similar mechas.  Also worthy of note is Yoko Kanno's music, an ingeniously rich mixture of John Williams, classical music, and ethnic choral chanting.  If anything, it was this soundtrack that captured my interests just as much as the characters and artistry.  Kanno truly is a talented musician, and her works can easily hold their own against Joe Hisaishi's scores for Miyazaki's features.All this, plus a whole lot more, makes ESCAFLOWNE an intriguing, creative series not only ideal for teenagers, but for a more mature audience as well.  (Plus, it doesn't delve too much into excessive violence or mindnumbingly misplaced filler dreck, either.)BANDAI Entertainment released this series on DVD several years ago, and now as part of this ""perfect collector's edition"", they've included not only all the episodes which comprise the eight discs, there is also an interesting bonus--a theatrical version of ESCAFLOWNE.  For those of you who are wondering what it is, first off, this is not NADIA all over again (lumping about a third of the movie with footage from the series with a less than interesting plot); this is an interesting remake of the entire TV show.  It's darker and heavier-handed; Hitomi, for example, is more suicidal, and Folken is a true villain, rather than a flawed yet benevolent commander.  It tells a completely different story, using most of the same characters, but it also eschews the sometimes annoying love-triangle between Hitomi, Allen, and Van, and, unfortunately, some of the other elements that made the series so interesting in the first place.  For instance, Merle, the cat-girl, is one of the most appealing characters in the show, stealing every scene she's in with glorious sassiness, but here she isn't nearly as well-defined.  It's also a bit bloodier, too, hence the PG-13 rating.  I wouldn't recommend the movie over the series, but rather as a unique alternate retelling, since that's exactly what it is.The visual transfers on all of these discs are top-quality, showcasing the stunning production values of the series and the movie, and the audio tracks (both English and Japanese) are in clear, crystal Dolby Surround Sound.  Some folks have issues with the dub, produced by Canada-based Ocean Studios; while this particular English track has its share of problems, notably occasional scripting mistakes in the TV series (Folken calling Van ""brother"" at a time when he's not supposed to, for one), and Andrew Francis' jarring portrayal of Dilandau (he plays him more like a spoiled brat rather than a maniac), it does benefit from some generally good voices.  In particular, Kirby Morrow and Brian Drummond are superb as Van and Allen, Paul Dobson does an excellent job as Folken, but Jocelyn Loewyn takes the cake for the best performance overall as Merle.  Mainly because she reminded me of Angora Deb's delightfully sassy Leaf in the LODOSS WAR TV series (and I like these kind of voices, too).  Kelly Sheridan, meanwhile, makes a decent Hitomi, although there are some times when she doesn't emote as strongly as she should.  But even after hearing bits and pieces of the (higher-caliber) Japanese language track, I don't consider this dub to be too unaffordable for folks who can't stand subtitles.For Anime buffs demanding a complex story and a stunning soundtrack to steer it by, ESCAFLOWNE (both the series, and to a lesser extent, the movie) is a must-see.",5,"Stunning production values, multi-faceted characters, spectacular music=one magnificent series.

847009,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0002VEVW0,P. Hardy,"[1, 36]","If anything, I was suckered into watching the Escaflowne Series when they advertised it on FOX-KIDS (Which no longer exists) because it mentioned sword fights, and hook-liner; DRAGONS. I was sold and decided to watch it. Despite the choppy-sloppy editing by Fox I really liked the show for the time it was on mainly because FOX sliced parts of the scenes that had something to do with the main character Hitomi and focused more on Van prince of Faneila more. I thought he was coolest character around. I mean C'mon FOX KIDS was a TV show populated with male cartoons and I was a young girl completely unaware of cartoons for girls (except maybe Sailor Moon) and girlie shows didn't appeal to me, so I couldn't care less about a female lead character.That aside, I decided to watch the uncut version of Escaflowne after they taken it off of FOX KIDS. To my dismay, the show was not about Van Fannel, but the high school twerp Hitomi Kanzaki. That disappointed me greatly, but I watched it anyway. The story is fairly simple if not repetitive, it starts off introducing you to Hitomi who is a track and field racer for a girls team who has a HUGE crush on the boy's track team leader Amano.She decides to tell him how she feels before he leaves to study abroad, but before she can do so, a young boy comes floating down from the sky speaking in a strange language and starts to fight a hideous dragon. From there Hitomi's adventure beings when she is spirited away to the world of Gaia for reasons unknown to her.The Animation in the show in well done Mecha-wise (the only element aside from the action for boys) move fluidly and realistically, the dub (as well as the sub) for the series is okay and features some of my favorite voice-actors from the OCEAN GROUP. There is a bit of originality for the villains, the Zibach empire. The drawings however character-wise are horrible. Everyone's faical features are done horribly, their noses and eyes were too long and their bodies were practically stick-figures. Its hardly impressive.The music, composed by the highly overrated Yoko Kanno (a Japanese version of the overrated John Williams) is simply moderate and okay to listen to. The only big drawer of the soundtrack for Escaflowne is the song ""Dance of curse"" which just has vocalists shouting Escaflowne's name over and over again behind an booming orchestra, however, the entire fact that Escaflowne is more of a Shoujo-romantic anime with war-action threw me off (the romantic part). Had been about the male character I probably would've gotten really into this show. Unfortunately the wimpy female main character doesn't appeal to me and Escaflowne is lacking that something that would've made it a great show. 3 stars.",3,Formerly a kids review,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,2726,"['anything', 'was', 'suckered', 'watching', 'Escaflowne', 'Series', 'when', 'advertised', 'FOX-KIDS', 'Which', 'no', 'longer', 'mentioned', 'sword', 'fights', 'hook-liner', 'DRAGONS', 'was', 'sold', 'decided', 'watch', 'choppy-sloppy', 'editing', 'Fox', 'really', 'liked', 'show', 'time', 'was', 'mainly', 'FOX', 'sliced', 'parts', 'scenes', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'main', 'character', 'Hitomi', 'focused', 'more', 'Van', 'prince', 'Faneila', 'more', 'thought', 'was', 'coolest', 'character', 'mean', ""C'mon"", 'FOX', 'KIDS', 'was', 'TV', 'show', 'populated', 'male', 'cartoons', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'completely', 'unaware', 'cartoons', 'girls', 'maybe', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'girlie', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'female', 'lead', 'character.That', 'aside', 'decided', 'watch', 'uncut', 'version', 'Escaflowne', 'taken', 'FOX', 'KIDS', 'dismay', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'Van', 'Fannel', 'high', 'school', 'twerp', 'Hitomi', 'Kanzaki', 'disappointed', 'greatly', 'watched', 'anyway', 'story', 'fairly', 'simple', 'not', 'repetitive', 'introducing', 'Hitomi', 'who', 'track', 'field', 'racer', 'girls', 'team', 'who', 'HUGE', 'crush', 'boy', 'track', 'team', 'leader', 'Amano.She', 'tell', 'how', 'study', 'abroad', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'young', 'boy', 'floating', 'down', 'sky', 'speaking', 'strange', 'language', 'fight', 'hideous', 'dragon', 'Hitomi', 'adventure', 'beings', 'when', 'spirited', 'away', 'world', 'Gaia', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'her.The', 'Animation', 'show', 'well', 'done', 'Mecha-wise', 'only', 'element', 'aside', 'action', 'boys', 'move', 'fluidly', 'realistically', 'dub', 'as', 'well', 'sub', 'series', 'okay', 'favorite', 'voice-actors', 'OCEAN', 'GROUP', 'bit', 'originality', 'villains', 'Zibach', 'empire', 'drawings', 'however', 'character-wise', 'are', 'horrible', 'Everyone', 'faical', 'features', 'are', 'done', 'horribly', 'noses', 'eyes', 'were', 'too', 'long', 'bodies', 'were', 'practically', 'stick-figures', 'hardly', 'impressive.The', 'music', 'composed', 'highly', 'overrated', 'Yoko', 'Kanno', 'Japanese', 'version', 'overrated', 'John', 'Williams', 'simply', 'moderate', 'okay', 'listen', 'only', 'big', 'drawer', 'soundtrack', 'Escaflowne', 'song', 'Dance', 'curse', 'just', 'vocalists', 'shouting', 'Escaflowne', 'name', 'over', 'again', 'booming', 'orchestra', 'however', 'entire', 'fact', 'Escaflowne', 'more', 'Shoujo-romantic', 'anime', 'war-action', 'threw', 'off', 'romantic', 'part', 'Had', 'been', 'male', 'character', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'really', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'wimpy', 'female', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'Escaflowne', 'lacking', 'something', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'great', 'show', '3', 'stars']",Escaflowne: The Perfect Collection

Burdick ""Zombie Golf Caddy""","[7, 7]","If you are sick of being preached to, if you are sick of stories being ruined to convey some overt message, if you are sick of your anime characters not acting HUMAN at all, then don't despair.  Escaflowne does none of these things.While you get some parallels in the Basram Energist bomb and such, there is nothing preachy about the analogies.  They are in the story because they work to further it and flesh it out.  This is very very rare in big anime titles, and is STILL the reason I prefer Visions of Escaflowne over all comers.  The story unwinds only to further and enrich the story.  Any preaching you take from it was merely incidental to developing the story to the best it could be.  The huge explanation of the technology and customs in the Series sure help too.  You don't watch Escaflowne, you FEEL Escaflowne.  It'll make you want to start meditating and taking kendo.  And maybe building your own guymelef in your basement.  If you watch this in one sitting like I did, you WILL look at the world around you differently afterwards.  At least for a little while.Next, you can actually grow to like the characters.  They react with real human emotion and rationale, something desperately missing from most of this genre.  Escaflowne doesn't stick its characters with the predictable inflexibility of most other series.  They're dynamic, changing, and emotive.  In short, the Series is awesome.  I've seen similar writing from other series in short bursts, but never on this massive, unrelenting scale.  Visions of Escaflowne's good from the start to the end.  Almost all of this is due to you being glued to your seat in the A.M., trying to stay awake so you can see what will happen to the people you identify with next.Box may not be as stellar as the original I hear tell, but being a typical male, I really don't care. ;)  The meat's in the Series itself, eye candy has never saved a total failure.  And Visions of Escaflowne doesn't need any crutches.  This's the Hope Diamond without the evil curse.  The Holy Grail of anime.  There's really not much to compare it to apart from itself, it's at a whole other level from most stuff.That being said, I find Escaflowne The Movie to be a real letdown. Basically all the good points above are NOT there in the movie.  But hey, it comes with one of the best anime series of all time.  Can just watch it twice to make sure you don't like it and then let it gather dust like I am.",5,The Crown Jewel of Anime,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2443,"['are', 'sick', 'being', 'preached', 'are', 'sick', 'stories', 'being', 'ruined', 'convey', 'overt', 'message', 'are', 'sick', 'anime', 'characters', 'not', 'acting', 'HUMAN', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'despair', 'Escaflowne', 'none', 'get', 'parallels', 'Basram', 'Energist', 'bomb', 'such', 'nothing', 'preachy', 'analogies', 'are', 'story', 'work', 'further', 'flesh', 'out', 'very', 'very', 'rare', 'big', 'anime', 'titles', 'STILL', 'reason', 'prefer', 'Visions', 'Escaflowne', 'comers', 'story', 'only', 'further', 'enrich', 'story', 'preaching', 'take', 'was', 'merely', 'incidental', 'developing', 'story', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'huge', 'explanation', 'technology', 'customs', 'Series', 'sure', 'help', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Escaflowne', 'FEEL', 'Escaflowne', ""'ll"", 'make', 'want', 'start', 'meditating', 'taking', 'kendo', 'maybe', 'building', 'own', 'guymelef', 'basement', 'watch', 'one', 'sitting', 'did', 'WILL', 'look', 'world', 'differently', 'afterwards', 'least', 'little', 'while.Next', 'can', 'actually', 'grow', 'like', 'characters', 'react', 'real', 'human', 'emotion', 'rationale', 'something', 'desperately', 'missing', 'most', 'genre', 'Escaflowne', ""n't"", 'stick', 'characters', 'predictable', 'inflexibility', 'most', 'other', 'series', ""'re"", 'dynamic', 'changing', 'emotive', 'short', 'Series', 'awesome', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'similar', 'writing', 'other', 'series', 'short', 'bursts', 'never', 'massive', 'unrelenting', 'scale', 'Visions', 'Escaflowne', 'good', 'start', 'end', 'Almost', 'due', 'being', 'glued', 'seat', 'A.M.', 'trying', 'stay', 'awake', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'people', 'identify', 'next.Box', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'stellar', 'original', 'hear', 'tell', 'being', 'typical', 'male', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'meat', 'Series', 'eye', 'candy', 'never', 'saved', 'total', 'failure', 'Visions', 'Escaflowne', ""n't"", 'need', 'crutches', 'Hope', 'Diamond', 'evil', 'curse', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'anime', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'compare', 'apart', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'most', 'stuff.That', 'being', 'said', 'find', 'Escaflowne', 'Movie', 'be', 'real', 'letdown', 'Basically', 'good', 'points', 'are', 'NOT', 'there', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'series', 'time', 'Can', 'just', 'watch', 'twice', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'then', 'let', 'gather', 'dust', 'am']",Escaflowne: The Perfect Collection
847011,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B0002VEVW0,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[49, 50]","When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne...What is Escaflowne? It is quite frankly, the greatest television show I have ever seen in my life. It is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that's a cross between Medieval Europe and the Asian/Middle Eastern regions. It is a story of an ordinary girl named Hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior, her destiny intertwined with its heros. It is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil Empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction. It is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight, a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom, a cute cat-girl, princesses, merchants, villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters. And of course, the giant stone Mecha that could save the world...or perhaps destroy it...If there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show, THIS is it. There is character development (like the perfect knight who has a hidden past, or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother), an incredible plot (the lost people of Atlantis, an engine which can alter fate, and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness), super-cool technology (like the coolest Mecha I have ever seen ANYWHERE, the Guymelefs), heart-warming (or is it heart-wrenching?) romance (complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing), action sequences to die for (giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords!!! Invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons! Dragons!!!), and characters that are very deep indeed (Hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story).Although many people prefer Japanese to English in their anime, this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch, with great performances all-around. The standout though, is probably the voice of Folken [played to perfection by Paul Dobson] (the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck, and one scene had me ready to cry). The animation and art is also quite glorious, featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of Gundam Wing, but with better use of color and FAR more complex and beautiful backgrounds. I must say that the soundtrack of Escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted. I currently have 3 CDs of the music (and I plan to buy the others one day), and I listen to it A LOT. Yoko Kanno's score for this anime could best be likened to some of John William's best (as it has hints of John Williams' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion, as well as choral chants for key moments). Take the piece ""Dance of Curse"" for instance. It reminds one a lot of ""Duel of the Fates"", but it came out first, and personally I think it's better. Played only twice during the entire show, it's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted. And I havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the INCREDIBLE theme that ends the last episode. In the end, Escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic. It's directed as well (or better) than the best movies of Hollywood history (using dramatic angles and the like), and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again. One of the few negative points I can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl Merle can be a little annoying at times (especially toward the beginning of the series). But by the end of the series, I don't think there was a single character that I didn't love. I also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode ""mystic eyes"". It doesn't go with the whole theme of the series, and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears.Believe it or not, for all its glorious ideas and execution, this show also has NO FILLER! Originally, it was to be a 36 episode show like Macross. So when it was cut down to 26 episodes, the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that's told. And ultimately, it's the story that matters most. As I watched this show for the first time I found myself addicted to its world, in love with its characters, awestruck with it's beauty, and enraptured with its music. The ideas though, were what made me decide this is the greatest TV show I have ever seen. In this show you will see fate altered, armies nuked, people who are half animal, creatures that can shape-shift, and even an incredible sequence where Hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm. When I had finished Escaflowne my mind was full of questions. What if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate? Does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means? And what of the Escaflowne Guymelef? Why was it built? Just how powerful could it ultimately become? To this day I am fascinated by the transformation that Van goes through, and I keep asking myself if the Escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil. Maybe someday I'll know. Until then I'll have to satisfy myself with...Escaflowne.",5,"A classic tale of adventure, true love, and REVENGE",1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,5980,"['When', 'great', 'classics', 'anime', 'history',
