60889,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0783228090,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","She-Wolf of London, 1946 filmThis story is set in London around 1901. A policeman visits the Inspector to take him to the scene of an attack in a park. ""It was a woman."" Miss Phyllis Allenby rides in the park with her future husband Barry. They hear talk about a female werewolf. Carol is in love with Dwight Severin the chemist. We learn about Reginald Allenby and his relationship with the housekeeper. Why did Mrs. Martha Winthrop's dog snarl at Phyllis? At night the barking dogs disturb Phyllis. ""You poor child."" Two constables patrol the park at night. The next morning Phyllis' fingers are stained, her shoes are muddy. The newspapers tell how a child was murdered. [Why was the child out at night?] Barry comes to visit Phyllis, who is upset. He talks to Carol. Latham from Scotland Yard visits the Allenby home to make his inquiries.Carol visits Phyllis to talk about her fears. ""Broad shoulders""? Gas provides illumination. Police patrol the park in pairs, they round up stray dogs. Latham walks around alone. A hooded figure in a dress follows and attacks him! ""She's done me in!"" Phyllis asks herself ""what have I done?"". Carol goes riding with Barry, then so does Phyllis. Barry doesn't believe in the Allenby Curse. He explains Phyllis' dream as the result of childhood stories. The police are on guard at night. Barry follows the hooded woman who leaves the house at night. A woman attacks the Inspector and gets away. Carol meets Dwight in the park. The police question them. The next day Barry questions Carol about her actions. After he leaves Martha talks to Carol. When Carol leaves the house at night Barry follows her. Martha brings a glass of milk to Phyllis. ""Drink it all."" [Is this a clue?]Martha tells Phyllis her true intentions, the police won't be able to question her. ""But why?"" The housekeeper hears it all! Martha continues talking (so we will learn the truth). Hannah runs off, Martha runs after her but stumbles down the stairs. Will this conclude the story? Barry smiles as if he is glad this movie is over.Lust or greed are the usual motivators for murder. This story has a trick that isn't revealed until the last minutes. Surprised? This story is entertaining but about average.

Although marketed as part of the ""Wolf Man"" franchise, SHE WOLF OF LONDON actually shares a closer kinship with moody gothic thrillers like GASLIGHT and THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE.Set in turn-of-the-century London, June Lockhart is Phyllis Allenby, an orphaned heiress who lives with one of her father's old friends, Martha Winthrop (Sara Haden) and her daughter Carol (Jan Wiley).  Engaged to be married to Barry Lanfield (Don Porter), Phyllis calls a halt to the wedding plans when she fears she is suffering from the ""Allenby Curse"".  A series of grizzly murders taking place in a nearby park doesn't help matters either, as Phyllis continuously awakens with muddy slippers and damp night-clothes, with no memory of what occurred during the night.  Barry sets out to uncover the truth as Phyllis fears the worst possible conclusion: that she is indeed the notorious She-Wolf of London...June Lockhart, the radiant TV star of ""Lassie"" and ""Lost in Space"", gives a most enjoyable performance as Phyllis.

60893,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0783228090,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","June Lockhart is the prettiest little werewolf you'd ever hope to see - or is she?  She-Wolf of London rekindles the old horror spirit by breaking ranks with its Universal predecessors and recasting the werewolf legend in a framework of psychology and suspense.  Most of the comments I read about this movie tend to give the whole idea of the film away, and that's a shame.  I went into the movie with no preconceptions, and while I was able to figure out what was going on about halfway through, the film kept me guessing until the very end as to the exact details of the story.Phyllis Allenby (June Lockhart) should be a happy young lady; she is well off financially, engaged to be married to the man she loves, and enjoys the companionship of her aunt and first cousin in the spacious Allenby house.  Unfortunately, there is a curse hanging over her head; for reasons unexplained, the &quot;Allenby curse&quot; casts a shadow on her future and, as far as we are told, led to the deaths of her parents when she was young.  A series of vicious murders in a nearby park points to a big dog or, as one Scotland Yard detective hypothesizes, a werewolf as the culprit.  When Phyllis awakens one morning to find her shoes muddied and her hands bloodied and then, at breakfast, learns that a child was killed in the park during the night, she is sure that the Allenby curse has finally struck her and that she has become a she-wolf.  She tries to hide herself away in her house, but her fianc&eacute;e can only stay away so long before he demands the explanation he deserves.  The story does a masterful job of building suspense and keeping the ultimate truth about the chronicled events a mystery.Many fans find this film rather boring, but I thought it was a wonderfully crafted and very enjoyable film.  By 1946, audiences had already seen Henry Hull and Lon Chaney, Jr., transform into werewolves on several occasions, and it was nice to break away from that mold momentarily.  You don't have to show the audience the actual horrors on the screen in order to make an effective horror movie; without a bunch of special effects to fall back on, such a film requires a tight and efficient script, convincing performances by the players, and the manufacture of an increasingly suspenseful atmosphere.  She-Wolf of London fits the bill perfectly, and I think it is a true classic.",5,"A good old traditional, plot-driven werewolf film",1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,2374,"['June', 'Lockhart', 'prettiest', 'little', 'werewolf', ""'d"", 'ever', 'hope', 'see', 'She-Wolf', 'London', 'old', 'horror', 'spirit', 'breaking', 'ranks', 'Universal', 'predecessors', 'recasting', 'werewolf', 'legend', 'framework', 'psychology', 'suspense', 'Most', 'comments', 'read', 'movie', 'tend', 'give', 'whole', 'idea', 'film', 'away', 'shame', 'went', 'movie', 'preconceptions', 'was', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'halfway', 'film', 'kept', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'exact', 'details', 'story.Phyllis', 'Allenby', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'young', 'lady', 'well', 'financially', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'man', 'companionship', 'aunt', 'first', 'cousin', 'spacious', 'Allenby', 'house', 'Unfortunately', 'curse', 'hanging', 'head', 'reasons', 'unexplained', 'quot', 'Allenby', 'curse', 'quot', 'shadow', 'future', 'as', 'far', 'are', 'told', 'led', 'deaths', 'parents', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'series', 'vicious', 'murders', 'nearby', 'park', 'points', 'big', 'dog', 'one', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'detective', 'hypothesizes', 'werewolf', 'culprit', 'When', 'Phyllis', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'shoes', 'muddied', 'hands', 'bloodied', 'then', 'breakfast', 'child', 'was', 'killed', 'park', 'night', 'sure', 'Allenby', 'curse', 'finally', 'struck', 'become', 'she-wolf', 'hide', 'away', 'house', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'can', 'only', 'stay', 'away', 'so', 'long', 'explanation', 'story', 'masterful', 'job', 'building', 'suspense', 'keeping', 'ultimate', 'truth', 'chronicled', 'events', 'mystery.Many', 'fans', 'find', 'film', 'rather', 'boring', 'thought', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', '1946', 'audiences', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'Henry', 'Hull', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'transform', 'werewolves', 'several', 'occasions', 'was', 'nice', 'break', 'away', 'mold', 'momentarily', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'show', 'audience', 'actual', 'horrors', 'screen', 'order', 'make', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'bunch', 'special', 'effects', 'fall', 'back', 'film', 'tight', 'efficient', 'script', 'convincing', 'performances', 'players', 'manufacture', 'increasingly', 'suspenseful', 'atmosphere', 'She-Wolf', 'London', 'bill', 'perfectly', 'think', 'true', 'classic']",N/A

60898,A315WMPERH1S0Z,0783228090,Tee,"[2, 2]","This little movie from 1946 is mainly of interest the baby boomers who grew up seeing June Lockhart on TV in the 1960's more often than perhaps any other actress that era (she starred in three series LASSIE, LOST IN SPACE, and PETTICOAT JUNCTION).  Daughter of a celebrated acting family, June's career went back to the 1930's and during the 1940's she played a number of secondary and smallish parts in major films (notably MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS) but never came anywhere near stardom.  That's why it's a treat to see the teenaged June here in a very rare starring role in her youth.  She's lovely with big doe eyes but not as attractive as she was later (she is one of those women whose looks improved as she got into her thirties).  She certainly gives this little potboiler more class than it really deserves, cast as a heiress who fears she may have the ""family curse"" and turns into a murderous werewolf at night.  This movie is not typical for a Universal horror film, it's far more of a mystery, closer to a NANCY DREW picture than FRANKENSTEIN,  and I suspect part of it's bad reputation comes from it not having enough gothic chills to suit fans of the genre.Don Porter as Lockhart's fiancee curiously gets top billing when his role is smaller than all of the three female leads. Perhaps he was under contract to Universal at the time (June was on loanout from MGM).  SPOILER ALERT: character actress Sara Haden plays June's mysterious aunt and while she was a very good actress especially in comedies (unforgettable as Katharine Hepburn's hillbilly friend/foe in SPITFIRE) her performance all too clearly signals too much and a better director would have helped her be more ambiguous.I liked this little movie and while, like I said, fans of the horror classics of the 30's and 40's will likely be disappointed, others may find it a fairly interesting and unusual movie.",3,June Lockhart is the Whole Show,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,1879,"['little', 'movie', '1946', 'mainly', 'interest', 'baby', 'boomers', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'seeing', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'TV', '1960', 'more', 'often', 'perhaps', 'other', 'actress', 'era', 'starred', 'three', 'series', 'LASSIE', 'LOST', 'IN', 'SPACE', 'PETTICOAT', 'JUNCTION', 'Daughter', 'celebrated', 'acting', 'family', 'June', 'career', 'went', 'back', '1930', '1940', 'played', 'number', 'secondary', 'smallish', 'parts', 'major', 'films', 'notably', 'MEET', 'ME', 'IN', 'ST.', 'LOUIS', 'never', 'came', 'anywhere', 'near', 'stardom', 'why', 'treat', 'see', 'teenaged', 'June', 'here', 'very', 'rare', 'starring', 'role', 'youth', 'lovely', 'big', 'doe', 'eyes', 'not', 'as', 'attractive', 'was', 'later', 'one', 'women', 'looks', 'improved', 'got', 'thirties', 'certainly', 'little', 'potboiler', 'more', 'class', 'really', 'cast', 'heiress', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'family', 'curse', 'murderous', 'werewolf', 'night', 'movie', 'not', 'typical', 'Universal', 'horror', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'mystery', 'closer', 'NANCY', 'DREW', 'picture', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'suspect', 'part', 'bad', 'reputation', 'not', 'having', 'enough', 'gothic', 'chills', 'suit', 'fans', 'genre.Don', 'Porter', 'Lockhart', 'fiancee', 'curiously', 'top', 'billing', 'when', 'role', 'smaller', 'three', 'female', 'leads', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'contract', 'Universal', 'time', 'June', 'was', 'loanout', 'MGM', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'character', 'actress', 'Sara', 'Haden', 'June', 'mysterious', 'aunt', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'especially', 'comedies', 'unforgettable', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'hillbilly', 'friend/foe', 'SPITFIRE', 'performance', 'too', 'clearly', 'signals', 'too', 'much', 'better', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'be', 'more', 'ambiguous.I', 'liked', 'little', 'movie', 'said', 'fans', 'horror', 'classics', '30', '40', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'unusual', 'movie']",N/A
