The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine (but still watchable), extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer.In 1914, L. Frank Baum, author of 15 ""Wizard of Oz"" books, started his own film company. Baum scripted and oversaw production on all the Oz movies. Life-size puppets were used for some characters, while actors often portrayed various roles from film to film. Although primitive-looking to modern eyes, this nearly 100 year old film is really how the author wanted his classic children's books to appear on theater screens.SYNOPSIS for ""His Majesty, Scarecrow of Oz"":Princess Gloria is the hypotenuse of a love triangle. She's in love with a gardener's son, while evil King Crewl has his sights set on her.RECOMMENDED:This title plus three other silent Oz photoplays are available onTHE WIZARD OF OZ COLLECTION 4 MOVIE PACK, from ALPHA VIDEO.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.0) His Majesty, The Scarecrow Of Oz (silent-1914) - Violet MacMillan/Frank Moore/Pierre Couderc/Fred Woodward/Raymond Russell",3,Silent-era Oz,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,1198,"['First', 'word', ""'gray"", 'market', 'DVDs', 'Often', 'transfers', 'are', 'not', 'highest', 'quality', 'movies', 'are', 'unrestored', 'rarely', 'pristine', 'still', 'watchable', 'are', 'non-existent', 'inclusion', 'artwork', 'liner', 'notes', 'varies', 'manufacturer.In', '1914', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'author', '15', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'books', 'started', 'own', 'film', 'company', 'Baum', 'scripted', 'oversaw', 'production', 'Oz', 'movies', 'Life-size', 'puppets', 'were', 'used', 'characters', 'actors', 'often', 'portrayed', 'various', 'roles', 'film', 'film', 'primitive-looking', 'modern', 'eyes', 'nearly', '100', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'really', 'how', 'author', 'wanted', 'classic', 'children', 'books', 'appear', 'theater', 'screens.SYNOPSIS', 'Majesty', 'Scarecrow', 'Oz', 'Princess', 'Gloria', 'hypotenuse', 'love', 'triangle', 'love', 'gardener', 'son', 'evil', 'King', 'Crewl', 'sights', 'set', 'her.RECOMMENDED', 'title', 'three', 'other', 'silent', 'Oz', 'photoplays', 'are', 'available', 'onTHE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'COLLECTION', '4', 'MOVIE', 'PACK', 'ALPHA', 'VIDEO.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.0', 'Majesty', 'Scarecrow', 'Oz', 'silent-1914', 'Violet', 'MacMillan/Frank', 'Moore/Pierre', 'Couderc/Fred', 'Woodward/Raymond', 'Russell']",His Majesty the Scarecrow of Oz

It's a fun romp through Oz, and has some decent special effects.The film itself has deteriorated substantially, and it appears no effort was made to restore it. That's understandable, especially for such a cheap movie.  The bad part of this disc is the audio. The music is a mix of ragtime and various other types. It has some relevance, as the mood does change with the film, but that's about all. The voice-over for the title cards, on the other hand, is just wrong.My conclusion: Buy the movie, but turn the audio off.",4,"Good, but....",1062806400,"09 6, 2003",2003,657,"['good', 'purchase', '4.99', 'especially', 'like', 'more', 'unusual', 'films', 'come', 'silent', 'era', 'Oz', 'books', 'fun', 'romp', 'Oz', 'decent', 'special', 'effects.The', 'film', 'deteriorated', 'substantially', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'restore', 'understandable', 'especially', 'such', 'cheap', 'movie', 'bad', 'part', 'disc', 'audio', 'music', 'mix', 'ragtime', 'various', 'other', 'types', 'relevance', 'mood', 'change', 'film', 'voice-over', 'title', 'cards', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'wrong.My', 'conclusion', 'Buy', 'movie', 'turn', 'audio', 'off']",His Majesty the Scarecrow of Oz
580603,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B00005B7BE,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[3, 3]","I have been an Oz fan all of my life and usually jump at the opportunity to add something to my Oz collection. So it was that I was glad to find this piece. Watching it, however, was not all I had hoped for.I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was written and directed by L. Frank Baum, the author of ""The Wizard of Oz"" as well as the later sequel, ""The Scarecrow of Oz"". As such, I expected it to be a very faithful adaptation of the book. In this, I was surpised by two things. The first was that the story was much less like the book that I would have expected from the book's author. The second is how good a job was done in a film dating from 1914.The basic story is that of the book. Princess Gloria has her heart frozen by an evil witch to prevent her from marrying a commoner. The Oz characters come to her rescue. The way this comes about, however, deviates significantly from the book and several characters are changed or are missing alltogether. This was a dissapointment to me but may not be to others.The state of the art for motion pictures was not all that developed in 1914. With that in mind, this movie does achieve some remarkable things. The ""trick"" are easy to identify but they do not detract from the progession of the story itself. These special effects include an underwater scene with the scarecrow, the actual freezing of the princess's heart and the decaptitation of the evil witch. They do blend well with the story. There is none of the ""how did they do that"" feeling but there is a ""I'm surpriised they managed that"" feeling to replace it.In appearance, it seems like Oz is located in the American plains of the midwest. This is particularly apparent when the scarecrow is seen in his cornfield with ""Indians"" dancing around him. So too do the river scenes seem more like a bit of Americana than the fantasy land of Oz. So too do the witches seem to come from Salem as opposed to the fairy land. This is another instance of something that distracted me but may not affect anyone else.Staple Oz characters making an appearance include Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, the Wizard, the wooden Sawhorse, Old Mombi, Button Bright (as a girl instead of a boy!) as well as those specific to this story line like Gloria, Pon, King Krewl and Googly Goo. Notably absent are Trot, Captain Bill and Betsy Bobbin. It is possible that Hank the mule makes an appearance but I don't know if that is intentional or a coincidence and the character is not named.This film is well worth buying for serious Oz fanatics. It does provide a diverting hour of entertainment and follows the basics of the story. So too might it appeal to silent movie fans who like silent movies for their own sake. The Little Rascals short is a nice additional touch as well.",3,"A Curious, Period Piece from Oz's Original Creator",1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,2798,"['have', 'been', 'Oz', 'fan', 'life', 'usually', 'jump', 'opportunity', 'add', 'something', 'Oz', 'collection', 'was', 'was', 'glad', 'find', 'piece', 'Watching', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'had', 'hoped', 'for.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'author', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'as', 'well', 'later', 'sequel', 'Scarecrow', 'Oz', 'such', 'expected', 'be', 'very', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'was', 'surpised', 'two', 'things', 'first', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'book', 'author', 'second', 'how', 'good', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'film', 'dating', '1914.The', 'basic', 'story', 'book', 'Princess', 'Gloria', 'heart', 'frozen', 'evil', 'witch', 'prevent', 'marrying', 'commoner', 'Oz', 'characters', 'come', 'rescue', 'way', 'about', 'however', 'significantly', 'book', 'several', 'characters', 'are', 'changed', 'are', 'missing', 'alltogether', 'was', 'dissapointment', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'others.The', 'state', 'art', 'motion', 'pictures', 'was', 'not', 'developed', '1914', 'mind', 'movie', 'achieve', 'remarkable', 'things', 'trick', 'are', 'easy', 'identify', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'progession', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'include', 'underwater', 'scene', 'scarecrow', 'actual', 'freezing', 'princess', 'heart', 'decaptitation', 'evil', 'witch', 'do', 'blend', 'well', 'story', 'none', 'how', 'did', 'do', 'feeling', ""'m"", 'surpriised', 'managed', 'feeling', 'replace', 'it.In', 'appearance', 'Oz', 'located', 'American', 'plains', 'midwest', 'particularly', 'apparent', 'when', 'scarecrow', 'seen', 'cornfield', 'Indians', 'dancing', 'So', 'too', 'do', 'river', 'seem', 'more', 'bit', 'Americana', 'fantasy', 'land', 'Oz', 'So', 'too', 'do', 'witches', 'seem', 'come', 'Salem', 'opposed', 'fairy', 'land', 'instance', 'something', 'distracted', 'may', 'not', 'affect', 'anyone', 'else.Staple', 'Oz', 'characters', 'making', 'appearance', 'include', 'Dorothy', 'Scarecrow', 'Tin', 'Woodman', 'Cowardly', 'Lion', 'Wizard', 'wooden', 'Sawhorse', 'Old', 'Mombi', 'Button', 'Bright', 'girl', 'instead', 'boy', 'as', 'well', 'specific', 'story', 'line', 'Gloria', 'Pon', 'King', 'Krewl', 'Googly', 'Goo', 'Notably', 'absent', 'are', 'Trot', 'Captain', 'Bill', 'Betsy', 'Bobbin', 'possible', 'Hank', 'mule', 'appearance', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'intentional', 'coincidence', 'character', 'not', 'named.This', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', 'serious', 'Oz', 'fanatics', 'provide', 'diverting', 'hour', 'entertainment', 'basics', 'story', 'So', 'too', 'might', 'appeal', 'silent', 'movie', 'fans', 'who', 'like', 'silent', 'movies', 'own', 'sake', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'short', 'nice', 'additional', 'touch', 'well']",His Majesty the Scarecrow of Oz

There are some great special FX, (the 'freezing heart' is fantastic!), and the acting is fairly good as well.

I'd seen a program on Public Television about the Oz movies some years ago and decided it would be fun to get.

580607,A1IUH51WI1TTSP,B00005B7BE,Sam A. Milazzo,"[0, 0]","Being the third and (in my opinion, thankfully) last movie by the Oz Film Manufacturing Company.Despite the title, it is based on ""Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" book with additions from ""Road"" and maybe ""Land"", before L. Frank Baum turned it into its own adventure the following year - with new characters (and an improvement!).  Although based on the First Oz book, this is the 3rd movie by the Oz Film Manufacturing Company and has scenarios not in continuity with the earlier movies of Patchwork Girl and Magic Cloak.King Krewl is forcing his daughter Princess Gloria to marry Googly-Goo and she refuses, before meeting and falling in love with Pon, the Gardener's boy.  King Krewl is not happy about this and, after discoverying their second get-together, takes action.  Meanwhile, as two men (Munchkin farmers?) make a Scarecrow, Dorothy is sadly lost in Oz and captured by Mombi the Witch (modelled after Denslow's original Wicked Witch of the West).  A fairy (dressed up as an American indian) and Cornfield Girls dance and bring Scarecrow to life.  Mombi orders Dorothy to do slavery before King Krewl arrives with guards and Gloria.  Mombi agrees to freeze Gloria's heart and Dorothy and Pon watch as she summons 3 other witches to help in the freezing of Gloria's heart.  Dorothy and Pon are chased by the Witches until a mule comes along (Nikkodemus from 'Magic Cloak'?) and fights Mombi.  Gloria feels no love for Pon and they, along with Dorothy, meet and free Scarecrow from his pole, who is enchanted by Gloria's beauty.  The friends make a journey through the countryside of Oz, but Mombi scatters Scarecrow's straw and fights the Mule again while Pon and Dorothy restore Scarecrow.  They meet Button-Bright, have  a meal by the lake (where Scarecrow stupidly plays in like a baby child) and oil the Tin Woodman near his Tin Castle.  He temporarily saves them from Mombi (who, literally, loses her head - a very funny scene!) who transforms Pon into a kangaroo!  The Tin Woodman, enchanted by Gloria proposes that they overthrow King Krewl and restore Gloria's heart.  They escape from Mombi by using a raft to cross a river where they go over the Wall of Water (Scarecrow actually goes underwater and sees a mermaid) and a gaint crow (from an earlier Oz film) saves Scarecrow from being stuck on the pole in the river's center.  On land, they encounter a cow (Stage's Imogene?) and are assisted by the Wizard of Oz.  Lion has a small fight with the Zoop (from ""Patchwork Girl"", useless!!) and Wizard uses his magic over Mombi while the friends cross ANOTHER River (this time we actually see footage of them getting on the raft).  They meet the Lion and Gloria is taken by King Krewl's guards.  The friends storm the castle (oddly, Gloria helps, despite frozen heart) and Scarecrow is crowned King - unfortunately, Lion is ignored!  In the Throne Room, Wizard has Mombi & witches restore Gloria's heart and he returns Pon to his form.This movie goes for just under an hour, with many (or all) of the scenes in the middle with long, usually boring and unnecessary additions, with the last few minutes being a rushed resolution.  There are good costumes and sets, but the picture quality is unrestored, with many light spots, a few obvious scratches, misty-like gaps and, worst of all, inconsistent editing: resulting in some scenes out of order (but not too much), most notably the 2  scenes of the river would have been better put together instead of apart, although the first river scene may most likely have missing footage.I have this film on Both DVDs: on its own and MGM's 3-dsk Collectors Edition, with both similarities and differences.Scarecrow DVD:  A woman narrates the on-screen writing (being a silent film) and the music could be described as 'bubbly', the same as which is included on the 1925 (solo) DVD.  The Scene Selection is 6 chapters and includes a ""Little Rascals"" bonus (don't like the braun episode at all) and a movie trvia quiz.MGM 3-dsk DVD:  Slightly improved, includes extra seconds with the Original Film's (company) introduction, no narration and a different soundtrack, but is all-one (long) scene, no chapters.  Would've been better had it also had a restored picture quality just like Chadwick's 1925 Wizard 'adaptation' on the same disk.",3,Scarecrow's First Movie of Oz,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,4282,"['Being', 'third', 'opinion', 'thankfully', 'last', 'movie', 'Oz', 'Film', 'Manufacturing', 'Company.Despite', 'title', 'based', 'Wonderful', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'book', 'additions', 'Road', 'maybe', 'Land', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'turned', 'own', 'adventure', 'following', 'year', 'new', 'characters', 'improvement', 'based', 'First', 'Oz', 'book', '3rd', 'movie', 'Oz', 'Film', 'Manufacturing', 'Company', 'scenarios', 'not', 'continuity', 'earlier', 'movies', 'Patchwork', 'Girl', 'Magic', 'Cloak.King', 'Krewl', 'forcing', 'daughter', 'Princess', 'Gloria', 'marry', 'Googly-Goo', 'meeting', 'falling', 'love', 'Pon', 'Gardener', 'boy', 'King', 'Krewl', 'not', 'happy', 'discoverying', 'second', 'get-together', 'action', 'Meanwhile', 'two', 'men', 'Munchkin', 'farmers', 'make', 'Scarecrow', 'Dorothy', 'sadly', 'lost', 'Oz', 'captured', 'Mombi', 'Witch', 'modelled', 'Denslow', 'original', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'fairy', 'dressed', 'up', 'American', 'indian', 'Cornfield', 'Girls', 'dance', 'bring', 'Scarecrow', 'life', 'Mombi', 'orders', 'Dorothy', 'do', 'slavery', 'King', 'Krewl', 'guards', 'Gloria', 'Mombi', 'freeze', 'Gloria', 'heart', 'Dorothy', 'Pon', 'watch', '3', 'other', 'witches', 'help', 'freezing', 'Gloria', 'heart', 'Dorothy', 'Pon', 'are', 'chased', 'Witches', 'mule', 'along', 'Nikkodemus', ""'Magic"", 'Cloak', 'fights', 'Mombi', 'Gloria', 'love', 'Pon', 'Dorothy', 'meet', 'free', 'Scarecrow', 'pole', 'who', 'enchanted', 'Gloria', 'beauty', 'friends', 'make', 'journey', 'countryside', 'Oz', 'Mombi', 'scatters', 'Scarecrow', 'straw', 'Mule', 'again', 'Pon', 'Dorothy', 'restore', 'Scarecrow', 'meet', 'Button-Bright', 'have', 'meal', 'lake', 'where', 'Scarecrow', 'stupidly', 'baby', 'child', 'oil', 'Tin', 'Woodman', 'Tin', 'Castle', 'temporarily', 'Mombi', 'who', 'literally', 'head', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'who', 'Pon', 'kangaroo', 'Tin', 'Woodman', 'enchanted', 'Gloria', 'proposes', 'overthrow', 'King', 'Krewl', 'restore', 'Gloria', 'heart', 'escape', 'Mombi', 'using', 'raft', 'cross', 'river', 'where', 'go', 'Wall', 'Water', 'Scarecrow', 'actually', 'underwater', 'mermaid', 'gaint', 'crow', 'earlier', 'Oz', 'film', 'Scarecrow', 'being', 'stuck', 'pole', 'river', 'center', 'land', 'encounter', 'cow', 'Stage', 'Imogene', 'are', 'assisted', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Lion', 'small', 'fight', 'Zoop', 'Patchwork', 'Girl', 'useless', 'Wizard', 'magic', 'Mombi', 'friends', 'cross', 'ANOTHER', 'River', 'time', 'actually', 'see', 'footage', 'getting', 'raft', 'meet', 'Lion', 'Gloria', 'taken', 'King', 'Krewl', 'guards', 'friends', 'storm', 'castle', 'oddly', 'Gloria', 'frozen', 'heart', 'Scarecrow', 'crowned', 'King', 'unfortunately', 'Lion', 'ignored', 'Throne', 'Room', 'Wizard', 'Mombi', 'witches', 'restore', 'Gloria', 'heart', 'Pon', 'form.This', 'movie', 'just', 'hour', 'many', 'scenes', 'middle', 'long', 'usually', 'boring', 'unnecessary', 'additions', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'being', 'rushed', 'resolution', 'are', 'good', 'costumes', 'sets', 'picture', 'quality', 'unrestored', 'many', 'light', 'spots', 'few', 'obvious', 'scratches', 'misty-like', 'gaps', 'worst', 'inconsistent', 'editing', 'resulting', 'scenes', 'order', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'most', 'notably', '2', 'scenes', 'river', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'put', 'together', 'instead', 'apart', 'first', 'river', 'scene', 'may', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'missing', 'footage.I', 'have', 'film', 'DVDs', 'own', 'MGM', '3-dsk', 'Collectors', 'Edition', 'similarities', 'differences.Scarecrow', 'DVD', 'woman', 'on-screen', 'writing', 'being', 'silent', 'film', 'music', 'could', 'be', 'described', ""'bubbly"", 'same', 'included', '1925', 'solo', 'DVD', 'Scene', 'Selection', '6', 'chapters', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'bonus', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'braun', 'episode', 'movie', 'trvia', 'quiz.MGM', '3-dsk', 'DVD', 'Slightly', 'improved', 'extra', 'seconds', 'Original', 'Film', 'company', 'introduction', 'narration', 'different', 'soundtrack', 'all-one', 'long', 'scene', 'chapters', 'Would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'had', 'also', 'had', 'restored', 'picture', 'quality', 'just', 'Chadwick', '1925', 'Wizard', ""'adaptation"", 'same', 'disk']",His Majesty the Scarecrow of Oz
