But i really apreciate it! There's a lot of fight sequence and a lot of adventure.

IT IS A LITTLE CORNY AT TIMES, BUT IT RECOVERS FROM THE MEDIOCRITY AS SOON AS THE FIGHT SCENES START. THE BLINDFOLD FIGHT SCENE BETWEEN JACKIE AND HIS ADVERSARY IS FANTASTIC.

Well... this sucks.  The disc is NOT remastered.  the ""b"" side featuring the original chinese version is an open matte poorly done affair.  The included interview is only five minutes long and doesn't really show or illuminate anything.  This is such a lackluster effort.  Supposedly it isn't even a real movie if you read some of the other posts on this page.

It was probably made at the start of his career. In this movie, Chan is continually fighting a gang of bullies to protect his family. Then continually fighting those responsible, after the his father is killed.  There are a lot of really silly cartoon characters. I didn't care for it. The entire movie is kind of comical.Jackie Chan looks about 20 years old in this movie. Those that like Jackie Chan may enjoy seeing his early work, but if looking to see Mao Ying...you'll be pissed.  I know I was.
