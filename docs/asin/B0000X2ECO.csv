Although uneven, the highs are excellent (tracks 15-18)and the rest is very good, especially compared to what passes for music in the U.S. If this concert doesn't put chills up your back, you're already dead.

All i can say is..WHAT A SHOW!! He had the crowd is his hands, he played all the right music at the right time..started hard, then calmed it down, and then just like a 747 taking off, slowly started playing hard, then harder and the rest was just crazy!Even though the music isn't really my style..Tiesto just puts you in a different state of mind that no matter where you are, what your doing, or what kind of music you like, you'll just watch and realize how beautiful everything is around you!Get this DVD...and enjoy the ride!  peace!",5,dj tiesto rules!!,1080172800,"03 25, 2004",2004,949,"['Being', 'DJ', 'Canada', 'mainly', 'playing', 'hip-hop', 'house', 'i', 'always', 'tried', 'perform', 'way', 'i', ""'d"", 'control', 'crowd', 'get', 'not', 'only', 'dance', 'music', 'feel', 'too', 'not', 'many', 'Dj', 'can', 'do', 'Then', 'DVD', 'mail', 'recieved', 'local', 'producer', 'intited', 'quot', 'DJ', 'TIESTO', 'IN', 'CONCERT', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'tiesto', 'know', 'tracks', 'never', 'saw', 'actually', 'performing', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'is..WHAT', 'SHOW', 'had', 'crowd', 'hands', 'played', 'right', 'music', 'right', 'time..started', 'hard', 'then', 'calmed', 'down', 'then', 'just', '747', 'taking', 'off', 'slowly', 'started', 'playing', 'hard', 'then', 'harder', 'rest', 'was', 'just', 'crazy', 'Even', 'music', ""n't"", 'really', 'style..Tiesto', 'just', 'different', 'state', 'mind', 'matter', 'where', 'are', 'what', 'doing', 'what', 'kind', 'music', ""'ll"", 'just', 'watch', 'realize', 'how', 'beautiful', 'everything', 'Get', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'peace']",N/A

This is cd quality music from start to finish with no crowd roaring. But if that's what they wanted, then why release it on DVD? I'd watch it much more often if it had the original concert soundtrack. As far as the concert itself: the performers they featured between sets was a little too much; they were more like clowns. Another thing I didn't like is that you don't see much of the anyone except Tiesto. He's in 90% of the scenes. Why? We know it's his concert; it isn't as if devoting much more of the footage to the kids attending the concert would've confused anyone. This is why I'm not giving it 5 stars.Visually - this DVD is absolutely stunning. I didn't mind the camera angle changing every 2 seconds. The best part of the concert is when Tiesto gets to the middle of Nyana. The combination of the stage effects at the climax of that song, together with seeing Tiesto just lose himself was incredible.",3,THE SONGS  ARE NOT LIVE FROM THE ACTUAL CONCERT,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,1009,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'only', 'one', 'reviewer', 'noticed', 'Where', 'sound', 'crowd', 'roaring', 'cd', 'quality', 'music', 'start', 'finish', 'crowd', 'roaring', 'what', 'wanted', 'then', 'why', 'release', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'watch', 'much', 'more', 'often', 'had', 'original', 'concert', 'soundtrack', 'As', 'far', 'concert', 'performers', 'featured', 'sets', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'were', 'more', 'clowns', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'anyone', 'Tiesto', '90', '%', 'scenes', 'Why', 'know', 'concert', ""n't"", 'devoting', 'much', 'more', 'footage', 'kids', 'attending', 'concert', 'would', ""'ve"", 'confused', 'anyone', 'why', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', '5', 'stars.Visually', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'camera', 'angle', 'changing', '2', 'seconds', 'best', 'part', 'concert', 'when', 'Tiesto', 'middle', 'Nyana', 'combination', 'stage', 'effects', 'climax', 'song', 'together', 'seeing', 'Tiesto', 'just', 'lose', 'was', 'incredible']",N/A

The special light and fire effects are very impressive, and the ""journey across 5 continents"" idea for this concert worked perfectly, I love the world music component of this show and the way Tiesto interacted with the bands was so fun to watch! Things I didn't like: the opening for the dvd was super slow. It was designed as a big buildup, but I don't think it worked. And I also thought Micha Klein's video art was too  simplistic,  too much like a cartoon, it did not match the mood created by the music and seemed to try to make a statement of its own rather than support Dj Tiesto's work.",4,Great music and effects,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,721,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'lot', 'feel', 'are', 'really', 'there', 'loved', 'music', 'liked', 'DJ', 'Tiesto', 'personality', 'special', 'light', 'fire', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'journey', '5', 'continents', 'idea', 'concert', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'love', 'world', 'music', 'component', 'show', 'way', 'Tiesto', 'interacted', 'bands', 'was', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'Things', 'did', ""n't"", 'opening', 'dvd', 'was', 'super', 'slow', 'was', 'designed', 'big', 'buildup', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'also', 'thought', 'Micha', 'Klein', 'video', 'art', 'was', 'too', 'simplistic', 'too', 'much', 'cartoon', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'mood', 'created', 'music', 'seemed', 'try', 'make', 'statement', 'own', 'rather', 'support', 'Dj', 'Tiesto', 'work']",N/A
