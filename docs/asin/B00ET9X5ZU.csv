1668695,A2SX0FUBCJXSZZ,B00ET9X5ZU,"L. Baker ""book addict""","[0, 0]",What we may have here is a possible sensationalism of someone who spent 80 years of his life talking with spirits and using amulets during mystic Kaballah practices and then at the end purporting to have had a vision from the MOST HIGH G-D. I know my Bible pretty well and it just didn't set well with me. This book is a book for itching ears. I wasn't impressed. I don't know enough about Judaism or the mystical Kaballah to be a good judge but as I read some of this book I got more and more uncomfortable and as a result lost an entire nights sleep. I don't recommend it. This book should get 1* for the picture on the front and that's it! I found the author to be misrepresenting his education with only his word regarding his diplomas. Sounds a lot like O.
