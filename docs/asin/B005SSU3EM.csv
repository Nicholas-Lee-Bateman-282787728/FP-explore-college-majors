With that aside the movie was decent, some gore, some suspence, a decent body count, and an obnoxious jerk named Tristan who is fun to hate.  Not so twisted of a plot to not see what's coming.

Then all of a sudden alot of things happen in the span of about 20 minutes.  The things that happen are a series of one person betraying the other and who to trust and not to trust.  The remaining portion of the movie is a chase seen that has a bleak unsatisfying ending.The acting was pretty lame especially the blonde girl.  For some reason the writer/director decided to make her character stupid...extremely stupid.  A stupid character ontop of bad acting makes a viewer not care what happens to them.  The other actors weren't much better.  The only plus I can even thing of in this movie is the brunette female lead.  Her character at least shows some throught in the actions and the actress does try to work with the sad script.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  Infact, the only reason for the two stars was the brunette female lead's character does attempt to fight back and figure things out...as opposed to the other characters.",2,started slow and ended dismally,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,1049,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'get', 'going', 'started', 'cleaning', 'living', 'room', 'first', 'half', 'Then', 'sudden', 'alot', 'things', 'happen', 'span', '20', 'minutes', 'things', 'happen', 'are', 'series', 'one', 'person', 'betraying', 'other', 'who', 'trust', 'not', 'trust', 'remaining', 'portion', 'movie', 'chase', 'seen', 'bleak', 'unsatisfying', 'ending.The', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'especially', 'blonde', 'girl', 'reason', 'writer/director', 'decided', 'make', 'character', 'stupid', 'extremely', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'character', 'ontop', 'bad', 'acting', 'viewer', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'other', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'only', 'can', 'even', 'thing', 'movie', 'brunette', 'female', 'lead', 'character', 'least', 'shows', 'throught', 'actions', 'actress', 'try', 'work', 'sad', 'script.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'Infact', 'only', 'reason', 'two', 'stars', 'was', 'brunette', 'female', 'lead', 'character', 'attempt', 'fight', 'back', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'opposed', 'other', 'characters']",Don't Let Him In

Kelly Smith's slow-boiling thriller throws back to classic genre entries like WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, but there is something severely lacking from the very start. We are immediately introduced to four terribly unlikeable characters: a cold and uncaring couple, the lead's lackadaisical sister, and her irate one-night stand, who only goes on the trip to escape the authorities for some unknown crime. The audience is so thoroughly annoyed by the time the four reach the cabin that we pray for some dark hero to come and kill them all, saving us from any further suffering. He does arrive, and they 'let him in' of course, so that things can finally get underway. What follows is a tedious back-and-forth between two potential killers as the women try to decide who to trust, but when Smith plainly tells the audience who the real villain is by depicting the first murder instead of alluding to it off-screen, there can be no mystery or suspense.

""Don't Let Him In"" sounds like a great movie.  I was expecting some movie about an escaped mental patient on the prowl or something along those lines...I know it's been done a million times, but you can always be imaginative with that type of plot.  Alas, ""Don't Let Him In"" attempted to put its own slant on the slasher sub-genre with an English flavor, and the result was not good.""Don't Let Him In"" is about three people who decide to take off and spend some time out in the country, but at the last minute they decide to take on a stranger and then they meet another stranger while off in the woods and not all goes well.  Sounds decent, but the plot execution leaves more than a lot to be desired.  The acting is atrocious, the script is lousy, the scenes are grossly uneven and the movie fails to draw the viewer in with even a rudimentary sense of suspense or atmosphere notwithstanding the decent setting.  The acting is really wooden, and there is just no emotion in the acting at all.  Thus, the movie really suffers, and it just cannot help but elicit apathy in the audience not only for the characters but for the entire movie itself.  The bottom line is that this movie was very boring, lifeless and the twist ending did not even come close to saving it.  ""Don't Let Him In"" is a very poor excuse for a horror movie...I could barely finish this thing.

Calvin and Paige are a thirtysomething couple heading off for a weekend retreat in rural England.  Calvin invites his younger sister Mandy along who in turn asks if she can bring her new boyfriend, Tristan, along.  Calvin reluctantly agrees and the four head off for a relaxing getaway.  Of course, that's not in the cards for the couples.  Tristan is an obnoxious snob; they encounter a hitchhiker who they ignore, a strange woman who lives in the woods and reads palms and finally the local constable who warns them about ""The Tree Surgeon"", a serial killer on the loose.  Later, an injured stranger named Sean ends up on their doorstep who nurse Paige takes in to assist him.We know from the film's opening that Paige will confront the Tree Surgeon...so just who will the serial killer be?DON'T LET HIM IN has some clever twists and keeps you guessing.  The cast is pretty good especially Sophie Linfield (Paige), Gordon Alexander (Tristan) and Sam Hazeldine (Sean).

1502886,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005SSU3EM,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","This is a low budget British slasher film, light on British humor. The film opens showing us a scantily clad woman who is escaping from the lair of the slasher and then it flashes back two days. So by the time the credit roll is done, we know the brunette is going to survive, and most likely everyone else will die.Calvin, (Rhys Meredith) a rather boring chap who we don't get to know in the 76 minutes they allot this film, is going to his family's country home. His brunette girlfriend Paige and top billed actress (Sophie Linfield) is going along with him. She is a nurse. His blond sister Mandy, (Gemma Harvey) who never met a man she didn't like, is coming along as well as her one night stand friend Tristan, a man even Will Rogers wouldn't like.Tristan has money and a secret. He has lived in the area where they are going. Meanwhile the friendly neighborhood policeman tells us there is a slasher loose known as the tree surgeon because he dismembers his victims and hangs them up in trees, although not like what we see on the DVD cover, but more like fastening them to the tree with barbed wire. Apparently body part props would blow the budget.In order to set the stage, a Traveler i.e. gypsy reads Tristan's palm and freaks out, telling everyone to turn around and go home. It was a nice touch. The film gives you so many clues about Tristan being the killer you know it isn't him...or is it?The picture has all the elements of a good slasher. The execution was fine, but the script and characters were boring. I kept waiting for this thing to take off, and finally when we got back to the opening scene I couldn't wait for this flick to end. It needed better humor and a shower scene.Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, no nudity. 2 1/2 stars.",3,HE WAS FINE WHEN I LEFT HIM,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1753,"['low', 'budget', 'British', 'slasher', 'film', 'light', 'British', 'humor', 'film', 'showing', 'scantily', 'clad', 'woman', 'who', 'escaping', 'lair', 'slasher', 'then', 'back', 'two', 'days', 'So', 'time', 'credit', 'roll', 'done', 'know', 'brunette', 'going', 'survive', 'most', 'likely', 'everyone', 'else', 'will', 'die.Calvin', 'Rhys', 'Meredith', 'rather', 'boring', 'chap', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', '76', 'minutes', 'allot', 'film', 'going', 'family', 'country', 'home', 'brunette', 'girlfriend', 'Paige', 'top', 'billed', 'actress', 'Sophie', 'Linfield', 'going', 'along', 'nurse', 'blond', 'sister', 'Mandy', 'Gemma', 'Harvey', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'coming', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'friend', 'Tristan', 'man', 'even', 'Will', 'Rogers', 'would', ""n't"", 'like.Tristan', 'money', 'secret', 'lived', 'area', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'Meanwhile', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'policeman', 'slasher', 'loose', 'known', 'tree', 'surgeon', 'victims', 'hangs', 'up', 'trees', 'not', 'what', 'see', 'DVD', 'cover', 'more', 'fastening', 'tree', 'barbed', 'wire', 'Apparently', 'body', 'part', 'props', 'would', 'blow', 'budget.In', 'order', 'set', 'stage', 'Traveler', 'i.e', 'gypsy', 'Tristan', 'palm', 'out', 'telling', 'everyone', 'turn', 'around', 'go', 'home', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'clues', 'Tristan', 'being', 'killer', 'know', ""n't"", 'picture', 'elements', 'good', 'slasher', 'execution', 'was', 'fine', 'script', 'characters', 'were', 'boring', 'kept', 'waiting', 'thing', 'take', 'off', 'finally', 'when', 'got', 'back', 'opening', 'scene', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'flick', 'end', 'needed', 'better', 'humor', 'shower', 'scene.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",Don't Let Him In
