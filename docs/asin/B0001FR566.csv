803436,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B0001FR566,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 2]","In 1951 and 1952, between ALL ABOUT EVE and NIAGARA, Marilyn Monroe was in her build-up phase.  The emerging Blonde Bombshell appeared in fourteen feature movies about evenly divided between comedy and drama, all black-and-white, and most for her home studio of Twentieth Century-Fox, a deft and prolific source of dialog comedies.  LOVE NEST (1951) is an engaging ensemble comedy that will remind many viewers of a citified MONEY PIT, as a returning World War II vet (William Lundigan) and his wife (June Haver) contend with a ramshackle Gramercy Place apartment house constantly in need of attention and expensive repair.  The husband tries fitfully to pursue a career as a freelance magazine writer, while the wife tries to decorate and refurbish their aging apartment. Their tenants are also a provocation, such as a dapper, aging romantic (Frank Fay) who has drawn a disconcerting and unexplained interest from the FBI.  A slightly zany attorney friend (Jack Paar, before his meteoric radio and TV career at NBC later in the decade) is instantly attracted to ""Bobbie"" Stevens (Monroe), a strikingly beautiful ex-WAC who has returned to her prewar profession of modeling, and whose very presence triggers instant comic jealousy from Haver.  MM, lovely and photogenic as ever, plays an intelligent, witty and sophisticated woman somewhat at odds with the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype that dogged much of her earlier career. From the studio that gave us EVE, A LETTER TO THREE WIVES and MONKEY BUSINESS, LOVE NEST is not tip-top comedy but a literate I.A.L. Diamond script and accomplished playing add zest.  The surprise ending is particularly satisfying.  Consumers who bought the DVD based on the dominant presence of Monroe on the box have a right to be upset; her place in this movie is charming and fun but quite small, and a more honest portrayal would have put Lundigan and Haver in the foreground with the remaining players to the rear.  Even so, LOVE NEST is good entertainment at a good price.

803437,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,B0001FR566,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[0, 1]","Any movie going through the hands of Diamond is worth viewing,and it's with good reason that billy wilder later partnered with him on so many films. He was raised in Romania and his films and it doesnt take much to see this have many european influences,which shoots through his writing like a comet in the nighting lighting up all kinds of aspects of life,and i do recall years ago an interview with billy wilder on 60 minutes in which he stated messages do not belong in movies my movies have no messages just entertainment. It is good for 20th century fox to bring out this film which has an early marilyn monroe and which showcases her here briefly,and she is good in the scenes she's in and these themes she would later take up in Some like it hot(1955)a film largely about the fantasizing mind since nothing really does happen in that film. How the fantasizing mind leads people astray. Here we have a good natured returning war vet,a nice man,who dislikes polygamous people and the story has him coming back home where his wife has just purchased an apartment house,and the fbi come snooping and he thinks they are after this polygamousperson,yet the writer tries to show this writer is polygamous on a fantasy level which has him bring thestartling beautiful marilyn(and she appears very radiant in this film)to the apartment. Someone who during the war he confides with a confidant. On the scene we also have a character,an ethnic character who intrudes on the neighbourhood in all kinds of ways with his values,and this point is labored throughout and actually tries to impose some values on the neighbourhood,the only character so interested. The police are here...and this person is jailed and we dont actually know what he's done...woman were supposedly swindled,however they voluntarily gave up their money,'women who drove their husbands to an early grave,so this character plays a mediating role in bringing justice on a moral level...and finds himself in jail. This seems to be  a place where the soldier's wife,her husband is a clux of sorts, a writer,good at stories,and the woman finds where paying taxes with no services to speak of,and she talks of people trapped,we need a private investigator whom her husband says she resembles...and at the end of the film the jailed ethnic character in a comment on what the film is all about says his 'sentimental attachment' is toward his house..and at film end toward the two children in the baby carriage which the writer prefigures is a kind of guardian for the area. Some very talented writers in very short duration can do very good moral dramas and mr diamond is all too good..the film is a spoof and comedy...like much od his work...and much of his work deals with how various layers or strata(a word he would like)infect daily life..and an interesting note that the various males or females view the same things and experience the same things but draw different conclusions and assess it in different ways...a good comedy by one of hollywood's best,of course you can watch it all as a surface comedy,and as billy wilder would say movies are just for entertainment! By the way this is not his film...Marilyn is great in her scenes and these brief scenes is why she soon replaced betty grable..although she often bailed out of 20th's productions,her own revenge on the male world of hollywood,..of course if she didnt exact this kind of revenge in other ways is unknown...as a person though i like her and her movies as she always someone who has some values...",4,Diamond does magic with ordinary story,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,3529,"['movie', 'going', 'hands', 'Diamond', 'worth', 'viewing', 'good', 'reason', 'billy', 'wilder', 'later', 'partnered', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'was', 'raised', 'Romania', 'films', 'doesnt', 'take', 'much', 'see', 'have', 'many', 'european', 'influences', 'shoots', 'writing', 'comet', 'nighting', 'lighting', 'up', 'kinds', 'aspects', 'life', 'i', 'do', 'years', 'interview', 'billy', 'wilder', '60', 'minutes', 'stated', 'messages', 'do', 'not', 'belong', 'movies', 'movies', 'have', 'messages', 'just', 'entertainment', 'good', '20th', 'century', 'fox', 'bring', 'out', 'film', 'early', 'marilyn', 'monroe', 'here', 'briefly', 'good', 'scenes', 'themes', 'would', 'later', 'take', 'up', 'hot', '1955', 'film', 'largely', 'fantasizing', 'mind', 'nothing', 'really', 'happen', 'film', 'How', 'fantasizing', 'mind', 'people', 'astray', 'Here', 'have', 'good', 'natured', 'returning', 'war', 'vet', 'nice', 'man', 'who', 'polygamous', 'people', 'story', 'coming', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'wife', 'just', 'purchased', 'apartment', 'house', 'fbi', 'come', 'snooping', 'are', 'polygamousperson', 'writer', 'show', 'writer', 'polygamous', 'fantasy', 'level', 'bring', 'thestartling', 'beautiful', 'marilyn', 'very', 'radiant', 'film', 'apartment', 'Someone', 'who', 'war', 'confidant', 'scene', 'also', 'have', 'character', 'ethnic', 'character', 'who', 'neighbourhood', 'kinds', 'ways', 'values', 'point', 'labored', 'actually', 'tries', 'impose', 'values', 'neighbourhood', 'only', 'character', 'so', 'interested', 'police', 'are', 'here', 'person', 'jailed', 'dont', 'actually', 'know', 'what', 'done', 'woman', 'were', 'supposedly', 'swindled', 'however', 'voluntarily', 'gave', 'up', 'money', ""'women"", 'who', 'drove', 'husbands', 'early', 'grave', 'character', 'mediating', 'role', 'bringing', 'justice', 'moral', 'level', 'jail', 'be', 'place', 'where', 'soldier', 'wife', 'husband', 'clux', 'sorts', 'writer', 'good', 'stories', 'woman', 'where', 'paying', 'taxes', 'services', 'speak', 'talks', 'people', 'trapped', 'need', 'private', 'investigator', 'whom', 'husband', 'end', 'film', 'jailed', 'ethnic', 'character', 'comment', 'what', 'film', ""'sentimental"", 'attachment', 'house..and', 'film', 'end', 'two', 'children', 'baby', 'carriage', 'writer', 'kind', 'guardian', 'area', 'very', 'talented', 'writers', 'very', 'short', 'duration', 'can', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'moral', 'dramas', 'mr', 'diamond', 'too', 'good..the', 'film', 'spoof', 'comedy', 'much', 'work', 'much', 'work', 'deals', 'how', 'various', 'layers', 'strata', 'word', 'would', 'like', 'infect', 'daily', 'life..and', 'interesting', 'note', 'various', 'males', 'females', 'view', 'same', 'things', 'experience', 'same', 'things', 'draw', 'different', 'conclusions', 'assess', 'different', 'ways', 'good', 'comedy', 'one', 'hollywood', 'best', 'course', 'can', 'watch', 'surface', 'comedy', 'billy', 'wilder', 'would', 'say', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'entertainment', 'way', 'not', 'film', 'Marilyn', 'great', 'scenes', 'brief', 'scenes', 'why', 'soon', 'replaced', 'betty', 'often', 'bailed', '20th', 'productions', 'own', 'revenge', 'male', 'world', 'hollywood', '..of', 'course', 'exact', 'kind', 'revenge', 'other', 'ways', 'unknown', 'person', 'i', 'movies', 'always', 'someone', 'who', 'values']",Love Nest

The cover is misleading because Marilyn never appears in uniform in the movie. Her part is small, but like all her early roles, she used every second of her camera time to make herself known, thus becoming the star we all love.Mr. Scott is a vet returning from World War II. His wife has purchased a tenant house in the city, a fixer upper. The rent from the tenants will permit Mr. Scott to pursue his writing. Among the tenants are Edie the widow and her daughter, Marilyn who is a returning WAC, causing some jealousy from Mrs. Scott, a con man, and the ""Mm-Hmm Man"". The only two lines the guy has in the movie is ""Mm-Hmm"".The con man goes after old widows and scams them out of their money. He claims he is doing it for all men, because the men worked themselves into an early grave, leaving their wives with money they did not earn or deserve. He begins his scam on Edie, but after realizing she is poor, he ends up falling in love with her an eventually marries her.Meanwhile poor Mr. Scott has his hands full with the house. The plumbing is bad, the coal is delivered in through the bedroom window, and the place is about to be condemned because of bad wiring. His writing isn't going so well either. His first story has been rejected. He and his wife begin fighting and he leaves to sleep outside in his hammock. Unfortunately,  Suds the cat decides to wreck havoc on him. Mr. Scott ends up sleeping in Marilyn's apartment while she is away for the weekend. He gets caught by his wife, but she has bigger news. She has caught on to the con man's game. Seems the feds have too and shortly after he and Edie marry, the police arrest him. All seems lost, but it works out well in the end.Mr. Scott writes the con man's story and it turns into a  national bestseller. They have plenty of money to fix up the tenant house and everyone lives happily ever after. The con man and Edie are seen walking down the street with their newborn twins.Marilyn looks great as always.
