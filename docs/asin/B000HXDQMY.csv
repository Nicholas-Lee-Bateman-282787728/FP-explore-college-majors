It was Donny and Marie Osmond's third Christmas special that not only features the famed brother and sister duo, but their entire extended familes too, their brothers Alan, Wayne, Jimmy and Merrill along with all their wives and kids, Donny's new wife Debbie, and of course their parents George and Olive Osmond too.The show resembles a set of their winter cottege in the mountains of Ogden, Utah. There are sketches where the brothers happilly sing even when they try to make Christmas meals, but things go apart very silly. Another sketch features Donny and Marie singing on stage at their own home-bulit stage studios in Utah with a live audience, and Santa too, of course.

1017541,A3LOXOMPX3ZPRK,B000HXDQMY,"Lawrence Brown ""Larry Brown""","[2, 2]","Overall: Fabulous.This is Donny & Marie's third Christmas special. This is not the one that features the outdoor concert, that's 1977.It's almost wall to wall music. There are no non-musical comedy segments, no guest stars, and a minimum of talking, impressive. Sadly it does not feature any live performance.Only one segment falls a little flat - the rooftop segment. The dancing and production is good, but the song isn't very good. Marie over acts in a style of performance that's really gone out of style now. As Donny relates in some interviews, he had to unlearn much of his performing style since it now seems pass&eacute;. The constant smiling and overt playing to the audience. It's interesting to see Marie performing this way and inasmuch as it seems old fashioned that gives you some insight into your own evolution of taste.The final two songs are sensational. An arrangement of ""Silent Night"" set against another tune and a final climax number with the entire family. Several other songs in the show are great.Donny & wife Debbie sing ""Three Times a Lady"" to each other to very good results. Debbie sings in a slight Osmond style and way better than I expected, actually very good. Donny is electrifying in this piece and the saccharine level may move you, it did me.The Osmond brothers appear throughout but do not get prominently featured. Jimmy gets a solo song and featured in a few other segments, he comes off well.The concert segment is a relative disappointment, it isn't as ambitious as other concert productions from Donny & Marie had been. It doesn't feature any live performance at all and does not feature any instrumental sections. It's not that long. That said, it still delivers an electrifying Donny & Marie duet up front and when the duet adds in Jimmy for a third voice the voltage is just that much higher.Even at this early stage (1978) the size of the Osmond clan is impressive with 2 parents, 9 children (most with associated wives), and a gaggle of grandkids.The Osmond wives sing a number in the talent show segment and it's ok. It ups the saccharin content but for historical purposes it would have been better to see an ambitious Osmonds production.The Osmond men sing through a comedy cooking segment production number. It's ok.George & Olive sing a duet by themselves - yet another saccharine over music moment. It's not great singing but it's a nice moment.There is an Osmond band segment during the talent show segment that comes off a little weak. It's painfully obvious that none of the instruments are actually being played. Merrill repeats yet again his banjo playing. Dad Osmond gets a bass solo which is just throwing it in our faces that we're watching air guitar. I don't know how good Donny is at piano but I'm pretty sure he's nowhere near as good as what we hear him play - we don't get to see his hands. Even so, it's good.The religious content is not in your face - just standard Christmas fare from people that actually believe in it.The overall effect, outside of the musical content, is pretty much as intended. The Osmonds come across as a tight, happy extended family with wholesome values and fun. There's some extra saccharin there but it's not so overdone that it's distracting.Overall: A, but I was hoping for A++++",5,Fabulous. Mostly music and mostly great.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to really enjoy an old fashioned Christmas special. There is a mixture of traditional Christmas songs, some uptempo numbers, and even some spiritual songs included. A particularly poignant segment included little brother Jimmy singing a song out in the snow.
