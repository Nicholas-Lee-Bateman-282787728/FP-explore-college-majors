667191,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B00005N91D,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","A good movie based on a novel by Vladimir Nabokov (written in 1930) about Alexander Luzhin, a Russian chess genius and borderline psychotic who suffers a mental breakdown during the world championship in Italy (not having read the book, I cannot say whether the movie is faithful to it). During the tournament Luzhin knows and falls in love with the beautiful Natalia, a fellow &eacute;migr&eacute; Russian, who despite the fierce opposition of her family returns his attention, eventually agreeing to marry him. The main suspension of disbelief in the movie comes from this. Of course, the beautiful girl chooses shy sensitive guy over tough, macho rival is a staple of romantic comedies. But Luzhin, as played by John Turturro, goes beyond the shy and sensitive and into the downright bizarre and borderline autistic. He appears unkempt, absent minded, with dirty clothes. My experience is that women never fall for men like that, they might pity them, they might become friendly with them but they would never feel any sexual attraction to them. Of course, the movie suggests that one of the reasons Natalia agrees to marry Luzhin is not so much because she feels sexually attracted to him (there is a scene where they kiss that is terribly awkward) but to upset her domineering insufferable mother. Also being a chess grandmaster in the path to become the world champion helps, even if your personality is totally off putting.The beautiful Italian settings helps the movie a lot. The movie is also bolstered by the fine performance of pretty Emily Watson (she of blue moist seducing eyes, very believable as a Slavic beauty) as Natalia. On the other hand, whether John Turturro's characterization of Luzhin is good is debatable. I think he makes the character too broad.",4,Interesting adaptation of a novel by Vladimir Nabokov,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1774,"['good', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'written', '1930', 'Alexander', 'Luzhin', 'Russian', 'chess', 'genius', 'borderline', 'psychotic', 'who', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'world', 'championship', 'Italy', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'faithful', 'tournament', 'Luzhin', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Natalia', 'fellow', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Russian', 'who', 'fierce', 'opposition', 'family', 'attention', 'eventually', 'agreeing', 'marry', 'main', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'course', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'shy', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'tough', 'macho', 'rival', 'staple', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Luzhin', 'played', 'John', 'Turturro', 'shy', 'sensitive', 'downright', 'bizarre', 'borderline', 'autistic', 'unkempt', 'absent', 'minded', 'dirty', 'clothes', 'experience', 'women', 'never', 'fall', 'men', 'might', 'pity', 'might', 'become', 'friendly', 'would', 'never', 'feel', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'course', 'movie', 'one', 'reasons', 'Natalia', 'marry', 'Luzhin', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sexually', 'attracted', 'scene', 'where', 'kiss', 'terribly', 'awkward', 'upset', 'domineering', 'insufferable', 'mother', 'Also', 'being', 'chess', 'grandmaster', 'path', 'become', 'world', 'champion', 'even', 'personality', 'totally', 'off', 'putting.The', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'settings', 'movie', 'lot', 'movie', 'also', 'bolstered', 'fine', 'performance', 'pretty', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'blue', 'moist', 'seducing', 'eyes', 'very', 'believable', 'Slavic', 'beauty', 'Natalia', 'other', 'hand', 'John', 'Turturro', 'characterization', 'Luzhin', 'good', 'debatable', 'think', 'character', 'too', 'broad']",The Luzhin Defence

(I can only think of one other work of literature that does, and that's a story by Stefan Zweig.) But that aside, it does have its share of flaws. True, Turturro is very convincing and believable in his role, easily the best actor in the film, and most of the other actors do a fine job. But in some places the movie feels cut short - we never really realize why Luzhin's ex-mentor wants to see him lose so much, or even why Helen falls in love with the former. Another very aggravating thing is the fact that Luzhin's early obsession with chess is very poorly and confusingly explained - there are numerous childhood flashbacks, but the events seen in them seem random and unrelated; at one point we see young Sasha burying his chessboard, at another being yelled at for playing chess too much. We never grow to fully understand the story, and that's the main flaw of the movie.

The chess figures come to life, the city hall where the chess championship is being played for. It seems a struggle between life and death itself for Alexander Luzhin, a Russian virtuoso whose life basically divides into three parts: the brief childhood before chess, then a long life after he learned to play, and finally a moment when he came to the resort in Italy and fell in love with his beautiful countrywoman, played here with gentleness and strength (a combination that only she could pull off) by Emily Watson. John Turturro and she share a chemistry that is hard not to sympathize with, and their plight to survive what seems an increasingly high-stakes game is admirable.Luzhin is obsessed with chess to the point approaching insanity; we see flashes of his childhood and youth that perhaps led to his rapidly worsening condition. He is a strange figure, eccentric and lovable. It's no surprise that Nataliya feels the need to rescue him from himself - he can barely take care of his clothes or health, spending most of his time rehearsing chess matches in his head and rarely aware of his surroundings. What doesn't help either of them is the appearance of a devious, jealous mentor from Alexander's past who feels the need to ruin his ex-prodigy's possible happiness or the first place in the tournament. Nataliya's family who is very much against this coupling is fun to watch - her mother and father provide some not so rare and very welcome moments of mirth in this sometimes dark film. Watching this story unfurl, one indeed comes to understand why behind every great man there stands a great woman.Without disclosing the ending, I will simply say that it stays with the viewer, and the entire experience is profound and touching. The best movie about chess I've seen, the best movie based on Nabokov that I've seen, one of the best movies I've watched in a long time. Fantastic.

667194,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005N91D,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","When a film is made from a novel, sometimes literary license must be allowed to unleash the essence of the new product so that it becomes a work of art in its own right. This film is loosely based on Vladimir Nabokov's The Defense and is able to achieve the status of a work of art upon its own merits. I found the film to be really wonderful. It is filmed in a beautiful setting on Lake Como and the flashback scenes of St. Petersburg are beautiful and darkly haunting.John Turturro is exceptional as Alexandre Luzhin, a chess prodigy with some autistic characteristics and almost complete lack of social skills. Through the use of flashbacks to the childhood of young Alexandre in St. Petersburg Russia we connect childhood experiences and trauma with the odd experiences of a disturbed fellow barely able to survive in the real world. We learn of Luzhin's development as a chess prodigy in an aristocratic Russian family.The film wisely unfolds by first presenting beautiful Natalia Katkov, played to perfection by the highly talented Emily Watson.  She and her mother are vacationing at a beautiful resort on the shores of Lake Como in Northern Italy.  Her mother, Vera, played exceptionally well by Geraldine James, is concerned with Natalia finding a rich, smart and handsome husband. Director Marleen Gorris wisely sets this stage so that you can experience how both mother and daughter respond to the entrance of the uniquely odd and awkward Luzhin into the scene. Daughter Natalia is attracted to this man with no social skills and graces for she has been reared in a world where these skills were necessary for human interactions and negotiations. Her mother however responds with total disgust and even horror when she begins to realize that her daughter might actually be attracted to a man she considers to be a lunatic. Geraldine James gets some of the best lines in the film as she is allowed to make comments about poor Luzhin that the viewer is probably also thinking.Luzhin is a somewhat sympathetic character as played by Turturro. A disturbed man with no social skills and characteristics of autism would be a challenge for any actor and John Turturro does an exceptional job of playing the odd Alexandre Luzhin, a man of compulsions and obsessions and tics. He falls for Natalia and proposes to her in their second conversation before he even knows her name. She handles this with grace, charm, compassion, and nurturance. But Luzhin has come to Lake Como for the world chess championship and he must defeat a handsome, intelligent, Italian master who is extremely sophisticated. Into this world however also creeps Valentinov, a former school master and mentor for Luzhin, and he tries to find a way to make Luzhin's defeat benefit himself. Valentinov has made a fortune displaying the young Luzhin as a child prodigy and the only way Luzhin could get away was to act like he had lost his gift for chess, at which point Valentinov drops him like a hot rock. Thus when Valentinov learns that Luzhin has risen in the ranks of chess to world champion he not only wants some of the action, he wants to get a bit of revenge on the poor autistic man that has escaped his grasp.Much happens in this fine film but one especially wonderful passage is related to Luzhin's inability to find a particular strategy that can be used to defeat the more worldly Turati, his Italian competitor. When Luzhin and Natalia make love, this first act of sexual intercourse with a woman he loves loosens him up cognitively and he eventually has a break-through strategy as to how to defeat Turati. Love can be transformative of the way we perceive ourselves and the world and this part of the film certainly supports this notion.Even if Valentinov is played as a villain by Stuart Wilson, the common goodness of many of the other characters comes through. Turati, the Italian master and competitor for Luzhin, played by Fabio Sartor, is revealed to be a genuine gentleman and fine person. The handsome French Count, Stassard, played by Christopher Thompson, plays the role of the man Natalia's mother wishes she would marry and he turns out to be a decent chap, supportive even in the final sad passages of this film.Natalia knows that her love is transformative, giving her a sense of power, which eventually she uses to resolve the equation of the sad ending. You will not come away defeated in the end, but rather appreciative of loves powers and limitations in a world where unfortunately some of us are damaged goods.I found this film to be excellent, thoughtful and moving.

THE SEVENTH SEAL awarded the game its life-and-death status, but did not attempt to portray the impact of the game on a professional player.  THE LUZHIN DEFENCE excels in portraying the obsessive, helpless creatures that sometimes emerge at the highest levels of the game. (And there are plenty down at the lower levels of regional tournament chess, I can assure you.)John Turturro, whose haggard eyes bear a passing resemblance to an agonized Jeremy Irons, takes as his chess role model perhaps Viktor Korchnoi (in his youth) or the late Mikhail Tal. His opponent is more clearly modeled on the suave Capablanca. The psychological aggression employed by Luzhin's former mentor recalls the Korchnoi-Karpov battle of 1978 in Baguio City.  There Korchnoi made all sorts of accusations about the Russian camp employing messages-in-yoghourt (that's not in this movie, by the way) and telepathic control from the front row of the audience (which is in the movie).The mental game is reasonably well done -- I even appreciated the fast-action visualization of possible positions -- but the simplified rendering of a world chess championship made it seem ludicrous:- After a preliminary pair of mini-leagues, the film implies that the world championship could then be decided by just one game between the winners of those two mini-leagues.  (Not even in the 19th century was the world championship ever settled by fewer than 10 games between champion and challenger.)- At one crucial stage, Luzhin's clock falls, which should always mean he has lost.  But in the movie he is immediately given an unspecified amount of time to seal his 43rd move.-Luzhin's not-quite-widow, who never plays chess earlier in the film, is allowed to take his place again the contender and finish off the game for him. (She doesn't even press the clock after playing the key ... Rh3 move.)Sorry, this is all getting too chess-technical.Bizarrely, the film has a debt to Alan Parker's BIRDY -- i.e. in both the slow-motion death leap from the window and the flapping exhilaration on the roller coaster.I liked the understated and unresolved elements: the arc of the red dress (worn by both his aunt and his fiancee), and the mystery of the glass chess set (why did he bury it? was it now beneath the giant chess set in the hotel grounds?)Lake Como is a beautiful place, and this movie makes it even more beautiful. (I must now go to Bergamo!) Hungary also comes across as a gorgeous substitute for Russia. The nocturnal flashback scenes could occasionally be confusing -- was this their Russian mansion or the Italian hotel?I really enjoyed watching the DVD, but I question whether in the future I'll want to watch it more than once a year. The plot was straightforward, and I don't believe there are many revelations to be discovered on a repeat viewing. But I much appreciate the other Amazon reviews of this movie, and will certainly add Nabokov's book to my must-read list.",4,Sumptuously realised portrayal of a chess obsessive,999820800,"09 7, 2001",2001,3033,"['depiction', 'chess', 'screen', 'had', 'chequered', 'history', 'almost', 'pun', 'intended', 'SEVENTH', 'SEAL', 'awarded', 'game', 'life-and-death', 'status', 'did', 'not', 'attempt', 'portray', 'impact', 'game', 'professional', 'player', 'LUZHIN', 'DEFENCE', 'excels', 'portraying', 'obsessive', 'helpless', 'creatures', 'sometimes', 'emerge', 'highest', 'levels', 'game', 'are', 'plenty', 'down', 'lower', 'levels', 'regional', 'tournament', 'chess', 'can', 'assure', 'John', 'Turturro', 'haggard', 'eyes', 'bear', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'agonized', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'chess', 'role', 'model', 'perhaps', 'Viktor', 'Korchnoi', 'youth', 'late', 'Mikhail', 'Tal', 'opponent', 'more', 'clearly', 'modeled', 'suave', 'Capablanca', 'psychological', 'aggression', 'employed', 'Luzhin', 'former', 'mentor', 'Korchnoi-Karpov', 'battle', '1978', 'Baguio', 'City', 'Korchnoi', 'made', 'sorts', 'accusations', 'Russian', 'camp', 'employing', 'messages-in-yoghourt', 'not', 'movie', 'way', 'telepathic', 'control', 'front', 'row', 'audience', 'movie', '.The', 'mental', 'game', 'reasonably', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'appreciated', 'fast-action', 'visualization', 'possible', 'positions', 'simplified', 'rendering', 'world', 'chess', 'championship', 'made', 'ludicrous', 'preliminary', 'pair', 'mini-leagues', 'film', 'implies', 'world', 'championship', 'could', 'then', 'be', 'decided', 'just', 'one', 'game', 'winners', 'two', 'mini-leagues', 'Not', 'even', '19th', 'century', 'was', 'world', 'championship', 'ever', 'settled', 'fewer', '10', 'games', 'champion', 'challenger', 'one', 'crucial', 'stage', 'Luzhin', 'clock', 'falls', 'should', 'always', 'mean', 'lost', 'movie', 'immediately', 'given', 'unspecified', 'amount', 'time', 'seal', '43rd', 'move.-Luzhin', 'not-quite-widow', 'who', 'never', 'chess', 'earlier', 'film', 'allowed', 'take', 'place', 'again', 'contender', 'finish', 'off', 'game', ""n't"", 'even', 'press', 'clock', 'playing', 'key', 'Rh3', 'move', 'Sorry', 'getting', 'too', 'chess-technical.Bizarrely', 'film', 'debt', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'BIRDY', 'i.e', 'slow-motion', 'death', 'leap', 'window', 'flapping', 'exhilaration', 'roller', 'coaster.I', 'liked', 'understated', 'unresolved', 'elements', 'arc', 'red', 'dress', 'worn', 'aunt', 'fiancee', 'mystery', 'glass', 'chess', 'set', 'why', 'did', 'bury', 'was', 'now', 'giant', 'chess', 'set', 'hotel', 'grounds', 'Lake', 'Como', 'beautiful', 'place', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'must', 'now', 'go', 'Bergamo', 'Hungary', 'also', 'across', 'gorgeous', 'substitute', 'Russia', 'nocturnal', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'could', 'occasionally', 'be', 'confusing', 'was', 'Russian', 'mansion', 'Italian', 'hotel', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVD', 'question', 'future', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'year', 'plot', 'was', 'straightforward', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'many', 'revelations', 'be', 'discovered', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'much', 'appreciate', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'add', 'Nabokov', 'book', 'must-read', 'list']",The Luzhin Defence
667197,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B00005N91D,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[4, 5]","There' s a big difference between these three concepts: duty, passion and bliss. Usually a great majority tends to overlap the first concept over the other two and that reveals an absolute clumsiness. The duty itself is bounded with all kind of unpleasant activity.But if you examine briefly the Greek concept of the term amateur you will surprise: Amateur is that person who loves what does. So the little difference between passion and bliss is in the involvement or commitment level you decide add to your activity.In this sense Luzhin defense deals about this last term: to follow your bliss, no matter how high be the prize you pay for reaching that goal . This inner satisfaction has nothing to do with economic profit. And that explains the devotion, vocation or frenzy according the case you face your reason to live in the world.A Nobel Prize is simply a human being who has decided to study six thousand hours for instance to analyze a special issue. And the over passion of a Chess player it can not be understood but through this consideration.Luzhin followed his bliss without care about any other consideration. The countless obstacles he had to overcome worked out much more as a challenge than a real warning. He did not mind any other issue.This crude and painful portrait is superbly by John Turturro in his best performance on screen to date. The astonishing actress Emily Watson as his devoted lover is splendid too and the rest of the cast is excellent.

667198,A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7,B00005N91D,James Carragher,"[6, 10]","Obsession, love, tragedy are the always fertile, though familiar, subtexts of The Luzhin Defense, a Nabokov novel adapted into a visually gorgeous film.  Unfortunately, for all Luzhin's passion for chess, for all the beauty of the lakefront location where it takes place, the film itself unfolds almost clinically and predictably. John Turturro looks throughout like an actor playing the part of a driven, socially inept genius.  That of course is the problem --for me, at least, he never transcended his actor self to inhabit the part.  Some of the plot devices are wooden, particularly one in which Luzhin's Svengali and former master teacher, Valentinov, somehow manages -- we are to believe -- to bribe the post-match limousine driver to lose Luzhin deep in the country, triggering his insanity.This is not a movie for mass audiences.  In fact, it passed virtually unnoticed in theater release.  Its best selling point is the pleasure of watching the superb Emily Watson as Natalia Katkov.  Leave aside the fact that she looks about as Russian as, say, Derek Jeter.  Instead, watch the subtle and many ways she conveys by expression, body movement, and spare words the astonishment and joy of having a simple vacation with her pushy mother turn into a love affair she herself, and all around her, would never in her strangest reveries have considered possible.One final note: The Luzhin Defense would probably have annoyed me no end if I knew more about chess.  Knowing the little I do, two flaws are immediately apparent.  First, in the scene when Luzhin's (John Turturro)clock falls, he is allowed to seal his next move, rather than losing, as is the case in chess competitions.  Second, in the championship, one game is played for all the marbles (to mix metaphors as well as games).  This is of course a huge disadvantage to the person playing black.Bottom line:  it's never going to make your all-time top ten list, but it is worth a watch.",3,Chess and Nabokov Make for A Niche Film,1008892800,"12 21, 2001",2001,1949,"['Obsession', 'love', 'tragedy', 'are', 'always', 'fertile', 'familiar', 'subtexts', 'Luzhin', 'Defense', 'Nabokov', 'novel', 'adapted', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Luzhin', 'passion', 'chess', 'beauty', 'lakefront', 'location', 'where', 'place', 'film', 'almost', 'clinically', 'predictably', 'John', 'Turturro', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'driven', 'socially', 'inept', 'genius', 'course', 'problem', 'least', 'never', 'transcended', 'actor', 'self', 'inhabit', 'part', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'wooden', 'particularly', 'one', 'Luzhin', 'Svengali', 'former', 'master', 'teacher', 'Valentinov', 'somehow', 'manages', 'are', 'believe', 'bribe', 'post-match', 'limousine', 'driver', 'lose', 'Luzhin', 'deep', 'country', 'triggering', 'insanity.This', 'not', 'movie', 'mass', 'audiences', 'fact', 'passed', 'virtually', 'unnoticed', 'theater', 'release', 'best', 'selling', 'point', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'superb', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Natalia', 'Katkov', 'Leave', 'fact', 'as', 'Russian', 'say', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'Instead', 'watch', 'subtle', 'many', 'ways', 'conveys', 'expression', 'body', 'movement', 'spare', 'words', 'astonishment', 'joy', 'having', 'simple', 'vacation', 'pushy', 'mother', 'turn', 'love', 'affair', 'would', 'never', 'strangest', 'reveries', 'have', 'considered', 'possible.One', 'final', 'note', 'Luzhin', 'Defense', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'annoyed', 'end', 'knew', 'more', 'chess', 'Knowing', 'little', 'do', 'two', 'flaws', 'are', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'First', 'scene', 'when', 'Luzhin', 'John', 'Turturro', 'clock', 'falls', 'allowed', 'seal', 'next', 'move', 'rather', 'losing', 'case', 'chess', 'competitions', 'Second', 'championship', 'one', 'game', 'played', 'marbles', 'mix', 'metaphors', 'as', 'well', 'games', 'course', 'huge', 'disadvantage', 'person', 'playing', 'black.Bottom', 'line', 'never', 'going', 'make', 'all-time', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'watch']",The Luzhin Defence

667201,A3IHBZ11SOGZQ8,B00005N91D,lexo1941,"[4, 6]","The movie of ""The Luzhin Defense"" is a case study in how one great central performance cannot redeem an otherwise woefully misconceived - or at any rate, misexecuted - film.I am not one of those literary snobs who thinks that no good book can be adapted into a decent movie.  I am a Nabokov fan, to be sure, but while I am not a fan of the Kubrick ""Lolita"" I concede that it has its moments...although I prefer the Lyne version for being more faithful.The real problem with ""The Luzhin Defense"" as a film is that the story has been fundamentally dicked around with, and I don't believe that that can ever be forgivable.  This is not a movie adaptation of a very, very good novel (although Nabokov's ""The Luzhin Defense"" undoubtedbly is a very good novel); it's a movie version of a story loosely based on a novel by Nabokov but with a very different plot, in which the title character is playing the role as if he were in a movie adaptation of the novel.  In other words, Turturro does a great movie rendition of Luzhin, but it makes no sense because somebody, on some level, wasn't interested in filming this novel; they were interested in banking on Nabokov's name, and also the names of Turturro and Emily Watson.The film story is a ridiculously trivialised and sentimentalised version of the novel's story.  In the book, Luzhin attempts to cure himself of chess and to a certain extent succeeds - but in the end he is tempted once again, succumbs to the temptation, goes nuts and dies.In the film, he plays the endgame but then dies, but his pious widow then goes on to win the game for him.  This robs the story of its entire point.  Chess is supposed to be Luzhin's tragedy.  If it's just something that someone else can do for him, what is the point of the story?In other words - forget it.  I would quite like to own this DVD, only because I have a perverse fondness for utterly stupid and disastrous adaptations of great books.  But, please - do not buy this because you are tempted by the magic words ""Nabokov"", ""Turturro"", ""Watson"".

667202,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005N91D,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 7]","Adapted from a novella by Vladimir Nabokov, this 2000 film is about the world of chess, genius, mental illness and romance.  Set in the early 1920s in Italy, it stars John Turturro, cast as Aleksandr Ivanovich Luzhin, an unkempt, awkward and disturbed chess master who is about to compete in a world chess tournament in a upscale resort.  Emily Watson is cast as Natalia, a wealthy socialite who is bored with her mother's matchmaking and is, instead, attracted to the lonely and weird chess genius.We see flashbacks about Luzhin's life which tries to explain his madness. The relationship between the two lead characters deepen.  The tournament begins.  We're all rooting for Luzhin.  And then, his former chess mentor, played by Stuart Wilson, appears out of the blue.  Wilson wants to destroy his former prot&eacute;g&eacute; and plots with Luzhin's opponent to do this.  I was confused by this character because I didn't think the background had set him up enough.It all plays out with a sense of drama.  The story was intriguing and held my interest.  And, at the conclusion, Emily Watson is called upon to do something courageous.  But in spite of excellent acting, fine lush settings and good direction by Marleen Gorris, the whole film just didn't jell for me.

667204,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005N91D,Reviewer,"[14, 16]","Obsession comes in many flavors, and exists for a variety of reasons; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it may be an avenue of survival.  Lack of nurturing, combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements, may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone.  And in extreme cases, the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession, driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing, and as we discover in ""The Luzhin Defence,"" directed by Marleen Gorris, a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem, and in fact, may actually exacerbate the situation.  Obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference; moreover, it gives no quarter.At an Italian resort in the 1920's, Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament, the winner of which will be the World Champion.  Luzhin is a Master of the game, but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him; rather, it is his obsession, that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life, and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family.  So Luzhin is a genius with an Achilles heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament.  That man is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), Luzhin's former mentor, who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to Luzhin.Valentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him.  Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament, Turati (Fabio Sartor), against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours, but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort, Natalia (Emily Watson).  And, genius though he may be, dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push Luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace, as well the curse, of his entire life.To tell Luzhin's story, Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess.  And as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who Luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life.  For the scenes of his childhood, Gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort.  The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace Gorris sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well.  She also underplays the menace produced by the presence of Valentinov, concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense, which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film, making Luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling.The single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of John Turturro.  For this film to work, Luzhin must be absolutely believable; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous, as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately.  It doesn't happen, however, and the film does work, because the Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life.  He captures Luzhin's genius, as well as his inadequacies, and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real.  It's a performance equal to, if not surpassing, Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of David Helfgott in ""Shine.""  And when you compare his work here with other characters he's created, from Sid Lidz in ""Unstrung Heroes"" to Pete in ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" to Al Fountain in ""Box of Moonlight,"" you realize what an incredible range Turturro has as an actor, and what a remarkable artist he truly is.As Natalia, Emily Watson is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely.  Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin, Watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective.  Most importantly, because of the detail she brings to her performance, it makes her accelerated relationship with Luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story.  You have but to look into Watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real.  It's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor.The supporting cast includes Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Luzhin's Father), Kelly Hunter (Luzhin's Mother), Alexander Hunting (Young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci).  Well crafted and delivered, ""The Luzhin Defence"" is an emotionally involving film, presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man.  We don't need a movie, of course, to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget, inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change, and to make a difference in the lives of those around us.",4,"Turturro and Watson ""Shine""",1014595200,"02 25, 2002",2002,5753,"['Obsession',

667205,A361LE16VBQDP8,B00005N91D,Robert Bezimienny,"[13, 23]","The novel of the same name by Nabokov should strike a reader as conventionally unfilmable.  Perhaps in the fingers of Fellini, or David Lynch, something could be done, but if ever Ron Howard were to purchase the rights then it would be time to lament; Marleen Gorris is, sorrowfully, of the same school as the redoubtable Mr.Howard, although she most likely graduated with an even lower mark.*While the novel is less about obsessiveness and genius and more an example of both, the film is both about and an example of cliched emotions and hackneyed dramaturgy.  Emily Watson and John Turturro are immensely talented but, frankly, their services are wasted, and I for one would have preferred a somewhat less gifted performer in the title role, say, Rush Limbaugh, for then, at least, I would not have been tempted to rent this movie, and the time given over to its viewing might have been more fruitfully spent cleaning the refrigerator shelves or, for that matter, playing chess.*Nabokov's book is not a realist novel, and one feature which betrays this is the virtual absence of motivation for Luzhin's behaviour (as an example: his autism is enigmatic, and prior to any childhood insult he is innately strange); the film-makers clearly feel that a character needs motivation, and so they inflict a crudely Freudian one upon him (this is especially ironic given Nabokov's ambivalent, but largely disparaging, opinion of glib Freudian analyses).  Similarly, Nabokov takes extreme pains not to name the Emily Watson character, who is defined in terms of a morbid inclination to compassion, and who is otherwise seen as 'plump, pale, and quiet', and 'not particularly pretty' - of course, all this is unsatisfactory for Hollywood-style mass entertainment, and so we have the ravishing Ms.Watson.  In like fashion, the somewhat seedy milieu of between-the-wars chess cafes is exchanged for the grandeur of the Northern Italian lakes, and the very shadowy figure of Valentinov becomes a technicolor villain.  Perhaps the greatest irony is that all this pandering to entertainment proves anything but entertaining.  The script is stilted and the drama, tired.  The depiction of genius as intertwined with mental instability is very weary indeed, and borders on the offensive.  The music is  generic to the point of being fit for the supermarket aisles.*The cinematography deserves special condemnation.  For a subject that remains personal and internal (even distorted unrecognisably from Nabokov's intentions), we see huge vistas, gardens, palaces and halls, Latinate grandeur and Russian opulence; the camera swoops and pans, and frames everything in a pretentious scale; even on its own terms, all this is done badly.  Third-rate Merchant Ivory at best.*As for the chess...in the novel, Luzhin's obsession is rekindled when he is taken to his first motion picture, and where incidentally the heroine's 'grizzled father' is seen playing chess with the family doctor;  a short quote, ""In the darkness came the sound of Luzhin laughing abruptly.  'An absolutely impossible position for the pieces,' he said..."".  In the film, some positions are plausible, some not, but clearly no interest is shown in the game itself.*This was one of the worst films I have ever seen.

667207,A40CCH74MOWE2,B00005N91D,T. D. Welsh,"[5, 6]","Having read Vladimir Nabokov's novel ""The Defence"", on which this film is based, many years ago, I was fascinated to see how the director would rise to a very challenging task. I was not disappointed: although the story is interpreted in a noticeably different way, it becomes a moving and remarkably unsentimental study of a strange, uniquely talented man and the young woman who suddenly and inexplicably falls in love with him.There are certain technical constraints. In the novel, Nabokov spends a lot of time depicting Luzhin's internal states of mind. The chess-related flights of fantasy have mostly been eliminated, but John Turturro - who gives a magnificent performance throughout - successfully conveys Luzhin's bumbling, inconsequential attempts to comply with the social requirements of the situations he encounters. Very occasionally, one of the actors reminds one of a historic chess player - at times Turturro, unshaven and distracted, has overtones of Tal, and Fabio Sartor's suave Turati combines Capablanca's elegance with flashes of Kasparov's self-assurance.The chess specifics are, sadly, not very accurate. Even in the 1930s, the world championship was never decided by a single game played between the winners of two sections of a tournament! Real grandmasters do not usually slam their clocks hard enough to break them, nor are they often surprised by snap checkmates in the endgame (although it has happened). But these compromises can be excused as artistic license, with the aim of making the story more exciting for non-players.Everything else is beautifully done - the period sets, clothes and manners, the interplay of sporting dedication with business ambition and even romance, burgeoning suddenly in the most unexpected place and time. I would have been amazed to be told that a rendering of ""The Defence"" would feature sex scenes, but they are perfectly woven into the logic of the story. There is a certain vagueness, too, that mirrors real life - at least as seen by Nabokov. Natalia's mother, who seems dead set against her beloved daughter having anything to do with ""that"" (as she calls Luzhin after their first meeting), rallies round in time for the wedding. And as for Valentinov, Luzhin's former manager who unceremoniously dumped him when he went through a bad patch, what does he really want now?Like so many of Nabokov's tales, ""The Luzhin Defence"" hovers ambiguously on the border between everyday reality and fantasy.

The sets/locations are gorgeous, and the acting quite adequate.The story concerns the mental disintegration of a chess master, Luzhin. He is portrayed as a kind and sincere person, though perhaps too nave. As the story progresses Luzhin becomes involved in a critical chess match. The stresses prove too much, leading to his mental breakdown and destruction.Those who have not read Nabokov's novel will probably find the film both entertaining and enlightening, as well as a glimpse into the world of professional chess.But those who have read Nabokov's novel might be disappointed. For the movie simplifies too much. Nabokov had a talent for providing a comic touch to essentially very dark subjects. The movie takes a different approach: it lightens the topic by concentrating all evil into a single character, an unscrupulous trainer/agent. This produces two-dimensional  cardboard characters.Nabokov's book explores the deeper question whether total immersion into abstract mental activities might be deleterious to the human psyche.  A neglected child, Luzhin immersed himself in the rational and secure world of chess. Was the withrawal from the world of social interaction the root cause of Luzhin's problems -- or was there a deeper reason yet?The writer G. K. Chesterton conjectured that:""Poets do not go mad; but chess-players do. Mathematicians go mad, and cashiers; but creative artists very seldom. I am not, as will be seen, in any sense attacking logic: I only say that this danger does lie in logic, not in imagination.
