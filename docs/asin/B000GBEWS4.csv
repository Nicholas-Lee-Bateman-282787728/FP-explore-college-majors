He has a certain over-the-top knack for performance that makes him an indespensible character actor in any role that must be played with intensity.He has made many important screen appearances in the X-Files, Alien 4, ""Exorcist III"" as the Gemini Killer (1990), and Gr&iacute;ma Wormtongue in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (and many others). His unique acting style made all these films special for me.",4,GRAVEYARD SHIFT-BRAD DOURIF WAS GREAT AS THE EXTERMINATOR!,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,534,"['enjoy', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'work', 'GRAVEYARD', 'SHIFT', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'exterminator', 'film', 'certain', 'over-the-top', 'knack', 'performance', 'indespensible', 'character', 'actor', 'role', 'must', 'be', 'played', 'intensity.He', 'made', 'many', 'important', 'screen', 'appearances', 'X-Files', 'Alien', '4', 'Exorcist', 'III', 'Gemini', 'Killer', '1990', 'Gr', 'iacute', 'Wormtongue', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'many', 'others', 'unique', 'acting', 'style', 'made', 'films', 'special']",N/A

""Graveyard Shift"" is indeed the weakest one, made entertaining by the bad acting of all involved. ""Pet Sematary"" is also badly acted, though Fred Gwynne is on hand to save much of it. It's one of King's more mean-spirited plots, and if there was humor involved (as the extras purport), I missed most of it. ""Silver Bullet"" is an odd film, a rather sweet coming-of-age film with a twist. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. (Even Corey Haim was almost tolerable.) And, of course, the special edition of ""The Dead Zone"" stands way above the rest. Fine acting and direction help secure its place among the best King films. Save it for last...OK, some are silly and mindless, but I like most horror films for that very reason. This collection has the added benefit of a couple of winners. The widescreen transfer is excellent. The price is good. I recommend it...all 4 are true to King, inasmuch as they all take place in Maine.",5,Good Collection of King Movies,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,1015,"['Certainly', 'opinion', 'subjective', 'like', 'sort', 'fare', 'silly', 'Graveyard', 'Shift', 'indeed', 'weakest', 'one', 'made', 'entertaining', 'bad', 'acting', 'involved', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'also', 'badly', 'acted', 'though', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'hand', 'save', 'much', 'one', 'King', 'more', 'mean-spirited', 'plots', 'was', 'humor', 'involved', 'extras', 'purport', 'missed', 'most', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'odd', 'film', 'rather', 'sweet', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'twist', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'Even', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'was', 'almost', 'tolerable', 'course', 'special', 'edition', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'way', 'rest', 'Fine', 'acting', 'direction', 'help', 'secure', 'place', 'best', 'King', 'films', 'Save', 'last', 'OK', 'are', 'silly', 'mindless', 'like', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'very', 'reason', 'collection', 'added', 'benefit', 'couple', 'winners', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'price', 'good', 'recommend', '4', 'are', 'true', 'King', 'inasmuch', 'take', 'place', 'Maine']",N/A
