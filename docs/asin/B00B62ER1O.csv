1622448,A3RXJYWBLOKP4O,B00B62ER1O,Irene Gierzak,"[0, 0]",This is a wonderful character. I would love to see more of Vares and his whole crew at the bookstore and bar. His relationship with the police is very believable and it shows the problems that they have to deal with. Vares is a character to himself and I would like to see more intricate plots especially ones that involve unsolved crimes from years earlier. This would allow him to have more interaction with his book shop friends. I love seeing the country side and the stories of how small areas think of crime and outsiders.

1622452,A3G7UPT8S83OWL,B00B62ER1O,whoiskermit,"[1, 1]",'Gambling chip' (second in this series) is a tour de force. The first series was wild enough. These are almost OTT. But they are not. Antti Reini (Vares in the TV series) never drops all the strings. Any pretense of a linear story line is abandoned in this second set. I seem to remember a time when there were guys like Jussi in the US. I repeat the 'adults only' warning from my review of the first series (teeny boppers will be bored to tears anyway).,5,better and better,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,454,"[""'Gambling"", 'chip', 'second', 'series', 'tour', 'force', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'wild', 'enough', 'are', 'almost', 'OTT', 'are', 'not', 'Antti', 'Reini', 'Vares', 'TV', 'series', 'never', 'strings', 'pretense', 'linear', 'story', 'line', 'abandoned', 'second', 'set', 'seem', 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'guys', 'Jussi', 'US', 'repeat', ""'adults"", 'only', 'warning', 'review', 'first', 'series', 'teeny', 'boppers', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'tears', 'anyway']",Private Eye Vares: Episodes 4-6
