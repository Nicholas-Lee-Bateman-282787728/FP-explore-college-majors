It's such a wonderful show I gave it four stars, but I've waited for so many years, and there are absolutely no extras.....you'd think they would include at least one or two interviews of cast and crew that are not on the first season. (I have that already.) I mean they made us wait for ten years, and probably would never have got these released had it not been for the millions of loyal fans bugging them.  Still I am a big fan of the show. I love Roma Downey, I think what she's doing with the new theatrical movie,Son of God, is wonderful.

1667877,A2ZELOPYDRS6VU,B00ENFS0FK,Love Our Military Men,"[18, 19]","Wow! This is the day I've been waiting for - to complete my collection of TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL. Airing for 211 episodes and nine seasons ('94-'03), Touched By An Angel was/is a wonderful family friendly series that starred Roma Downey, Della Reese (who sang the show's inspiring and melodic theme song ""I Will Walk With You""), John Dye and Valerie Bertinelli. The show maintained strong scripting and acting talent that had cross generational appeal for viewing audiences from all stratosphere's of society. This same audience longed for and desired quality programming that was rich with meaning and that would contain content that could be identified with (rather than the 'minus I.Q' programming that generally left us feeling as though we'd wasted an hour of precious time) and TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL delivered on the goods! When season 4 was released to DVD in December '07 and no forthcoming releases were announced, many fans (like myself) were devastated and disappointed, thinking that we would never see the remaining five seasons. Five years later, on July 24, 2012, Season 5 was released and the studio has gifted us with a release about every three months - and here we are with a release date of November 19, 2013 for this final season. I am one happy camper - can't wait to see that one last space on my DVD library shelf filled in for a completed collection. I especially appreciated that the series ended with closure with the episode ""I Will Walk With You"" which see Monica up for promotion, but not before going through a very challenging circumstance!This season enjoyed a nice roster of guest stars which included:Mary-Margaret Humes, Robert Pastorelli, Taylor Handley, Scott Christopher, Rachel Luttrell, Nancy Linehan Charles, Ryan Hurst, Stacy Edwards, Bob Gunton, Daniel Baldwin, Billy Aaron Brown, Nancy Everhard, Matt Malloy, Eddie Mills, Stacy Keach, William Stanford Davis, Charles Durning, Gavin Macleod, Jessica Walters, Wynonna Judd, Susan Dolan, Patrick Duffy, Patty Duke, Marion Ross, Randy Travis, Bob Bancroft, Cloris Leachman and many more!The episode list for this final season is as follows:1. A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE - The angels help out a father and son who are having a hard time bonding, and an elderly woman who wants to die so that she may once again be with her husband.2. THE SIXTEENTH MINUTE - A downtrodden office worker is given a taste of fame after he saves the life of a woman caught in a collapsed silver mine. But the man's heroism goes to his head and begins to affect his work.3. TWO SIDES TO EVERY ANGEL - Gloria and Monica take a trip to resolve their differences and find common ground, but Gloria's demonic twin causes problems.4. THE WORD - Monica becomes a substitute teacher for a class with learning disabilities and health problems, but finds one student in particular needs her help to cope with obsessive compulsive disorder.5. A FEATHER ON THE BREATH OF GOD - Events take an interesting turn when the angels try to help a dying woman find a home for her young daughter.6. JUMP! - The angels help a teenager who threatens to throw himself off an apartment building, and an embittered radio DJ who tries to take advantage of the situation to boost his ratings.7. BRING ON THE RAIN - The angels help a teenager who, ashamed of her home life, tries to pass herself off as being wealthy - but her deception soon comes to light and threatens her relationship with her mother.8. REMEMBERING ME (PART 1) - The angels try to help a success-minded man who is more interested in money than his family, but the mission gets complicated when Tess starts to show early signs of Alzheimer's disease.9. REMEMBERING ME (PART 2) - Tess's worsening condition frustrates Monica, who fears she will never be the same again. Meanwhile, the angels help a father after his adoption hearing is postponed when the paternal mother returns - years after abandoning her child in front of a burning building.10. THE CHRISTMAS WATCH - The angels pull out all the stops to raise the flagging spirits of a group of workers who receive bad news on Christmas Eve.11.

AND A NIGHTINGALE SANG - The team intervenes on Valentine's Day when couples face a series of challenges to test their continued happiness.13. THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL - The angels help a priest lend guidance to troubled brothers on opposite sides of the law before a planned crime is carried out.14.

AS IT IS IN HEAVEN - A lost angel tries to find her way back to Heaven, with a little help from the divine heroines.16. SONG FOR MY FATHER - Divine intervention is the only option for a singer in danger of losing her voice.17. THE GOOD EARTH - An inventor needs the angel's help to complete his latest energy-saving device before he dies.18. VIRTUAL REALITY - A youngster obsessed with a violent computer game is accused of manslaughter, and the angels must discover whether he is guilty by questioning his troubled cousin.19. THE SHOW MUST NOT GO ON - A children's theatre is in desperate need of a revamp when its director suffers a fatal heart attack and a bunch of delinquents vandalize it. Unfortunately, the current staff of actors are too self-centered to help.20. AT THE END OF THE AISLE - The angels are reunited with an old friend on the eve of her wedding and must prevent her making a huge mistake.21. I WILL WALK WITH YOU (PART 1) - Monica is assigned to assist a doctor who is trying to open an AIDS hospice against the wishes of many residents of the city. Tess is along for the ride because there is a man there she knew as a small boy and she is hoping to see him again.22. I WILL WALK WITH YOU (PART 2) - Wayne tries to protect Zack, but soon realizes he's got his work cut out when his charge admits he was at the school on the day of the explosion - but has no alibi. Monica must overcome her revulsion at the person accused of killing schoolchildren in order to complete her assignment.Subtitles in English will be included for the hearing impaired.If you've never seen or been introduced to this wonderful series, it's never to late to 'jump in' - the show had wonderful lessons in life where something could be derived and learned from in EVERY episode and left you feeling uplifted before the closing credits started rolling. This is one worthwhile purchase, and oh by the way, keep a handkerchief handy - you'll need it! There's some good ones in this season!
