333905,A3F8U4CRMDLY2T,6302787041,CHUCK WEST,"[55, 63]","I have to admit that I was not prepared for what this film was to be about: Post-WWII Britain and the harsh realities of piecing life back together after years of andrenalin-pumped chaos and drama. I think I was  expecting this film to be lighter and more of an MGM &quot;production&quot;  than what it turned out to be. In retrospect, I realize now that the best  aspect of &quot;The Miniver Story&quot; is that MGM did not overglamourize  Postwar England the way it glamourized WWII England in &quot;Mrs.  Miniver.&quot; Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon are still wonderful here as  the genteel middle-class couple whose love can conquer all, including her  can't-win battle with cancer. One could easily imagine the timeless  &quot;coming to terms with terminal cancer&quot; scenes between husband and  wife transposed into any modern-day story of partners dealing with  incurable and/or degenerating diseases/conditions (AIDS, Alzheimer's,  Parkinson's, leukemia, etc.). The strength of character and bravery (along  with great acting and solid MGM production values) are the only  similarities to &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; you'll read in &quot;The Miniver  Story.&quot;",2,AS DEPRESSING AS POSTWAR EUROPE WOULD HAVE BEEN,943660800,"11 27, 1999",1999,1172,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'be', 'Post-WWII', 'Britain', 'harsh', 'realities', 'piecing', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'years', 'andrenalin-pumped', 'chaos', 'drama', 'think', 'was', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'lighter', 'more', 'MGM', 'quot', 'production', 'quot', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'retrospect', 'realize', 'now', 'best', 'aspect', 'quot', 'Miniver', 'Story', 'quot', 'MGM', 'did', 'not', 'overglamourize', 'Postwar', 'England', 'way', 'glamourized', 'WWII', 'England', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver.', 'quot', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'are', 'still', 'wonderful', 'here', 'genteel', 'middle-class', 'couple', 'love', 'can', 'conquer', 'including', ""can't-win"", 'battle', 'cancer', 'One', 'could', 'easily', 'imagine', 'timeless', 'quot', 'coming', 'terms', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'quot', 'scenes', 'husband', 'wife', 'transposed', 'modern-day', 'story', 'partners', 'dealing', 'incurable', 'and/or', 'degenerating', 'diseases/conditions', 'AIDS', 'Alzheimer', 'Parkinson', 'leukemia', 'etc.', 'strength', 'character', 'bravery', 'great', 'acting', 'solid', 'MGM', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'only', 'similarities', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'read', 'quot', 'Miniver', 'Story.', 'quot']",The Miniver Story VHS

Lombard ""Lizasaurus""","[5, 5]","I have waited a long, long time for this movie to be released on DVD as I remember seeing it a many, many years ago - only once - and I have always wanted to see it again.  I thought Amazon would let me know when it was released as I had asked to be advised but unfortunately they did not.  I found it on another site and then checked Amazon to see if they had it at last.  Even though it was a sad movie I did enjoy it very much.  It was disappointing that they did not have any reference to the older son and what had happened to him.  They rarely make movies of this calibre today - brilliant acting and an engrossing story.

Sigh.I grew up in the UK during the Blitz and still remember, all too well, being pulled out of bed and hurried to the bomb shelter at the end of the garden, as well the sounds of planes overhead and distant bombs falling. While it's true that there are no battle scenes, the story of what Britain's ordinary people personally endured during WWII is beautifully told. Almost the best part of the movie is about the rescue of the entire British and French armies, 400,000 men in all, by the English small boat owners from the beach at Dunkirk where they were hopelessly trapped between a German total bombardment and the sea. Because the water was so shallow, the Navy ships couldn't get into the beach. Instead, were they were forced drop anchor and wait several miles out. Not knowing what else to do, the British government put out a desperate call for help to any individual who owned a small fishing or pleasure boat to go to Dunkirk and ferry the trapped soldiers, a few at a time, to the waiting fleet. The courage and heroism of the ordinary volunteers who went back and forth, unarmed, in their small boats for five days through the German barrage, is almost indescribable. Incredibly, they rescued almost all of the waiting men, sometimes only four and five at a time. Only one other movie that I know of that tells this incredible story, (of which few, if any, of the younger generation are even aware) is Paul Gallico's &#34;The Snow Goose&#34;.
