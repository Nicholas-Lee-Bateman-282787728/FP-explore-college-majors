It's a little tough to buy the revolutionary enthusiasm the characters have, but then maybe that's the point. I consider the movie to be a little uneven because it seems to change its focus and bite throughout. The first part is about how two friends break into houses to rearrange furniture but not steal. It also covers the desperation of the girlfriend of one of them who is working to pay off a debt due to an uninsured auto accident. This part comes to a climax when the other friend and the girl have bonded but get caught in the house of the man she owes money to. The tempo then switches to a kidnapping scenario in which they take the guy a mountain retreat and spend a lot of time talking, even finding out the rich guy was once a revolutionary himself. Finally in the end, just when it seems like everyone has changed their ways, everything goes back to the way it was. The last image is a note found by the police in their apartment saying ""Some men never change.""

Che Guevara t-shirts and anarchy stickers.""); Jule (played by Julia Jentsch, the dazzling young actress from ""Sophie Scholl""), a directionless and searching soul who, as Jan says, goes to so many protests against exploitation and oppression but is still oppressed and exploited herself; and Peter, an somewhat nave idealist who early on tells Jule to ""always go for the brightest colors"" when choosing an ice cream flavor.Apparently, writer/director Hans Weingartner took these latter words to heart in the making of this movie; it's been ages since I've seen such vivid, vibrant hues in a film - from the chaotic neon of the boisterous Berlin cityscape to the pastoral calm of the countryside, this movie is awash in breathtaking color.The same could also be said about its characters - though they may start of as seemingly one-dimensional archetypes, many shades of light and dark emerge from each well-acted portrait.  And when complications arise in the young revolutionaries' activities (as they always do, when one puts one's dreams into action), they end up on opposite sides of a standoff in which some remarkable similarities are discovered.The Edukators deftly mixes politics of the mind with politics of the heart and whips it all into a heady and suspenseful stew.  (And no small amount of suspense was created by my own worries, as the film neared its conclusion, that there was no way to end it in a satisfactory way - happily, I was wrong!).And while the DVD lacks any real extras, with 2 hours and 10 minutes of such satisfying and sumptuous cinematic goodness, can you really bite off any more when you're already so full?!",5,Get Edukated!,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,2068,"['entered', 'film', 'expectations', 'Edukators', 'hit', 'combination', 'spiked', 'punch', 'sucker', 'punch', 'left', 'surprisingly', 'shaken', 'yet', 'somehow', 'also', 'refreshingly', 'intoxicatingly', 'awakened.The', 'Edukators', 'journey', 'three', 'would-be', 'revolutionaries', 'Jan', 'passionate', 'iconoclast', 'who', 'commodification', 'dissent', 'What', 'used', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'can', 'buy', 'stores', 'today', 'Che', 'Guevara', 't-shirts', 'anarchy', 'stickers', 'Jule', 'played', 'Julia', 'Jentsch', 'dazzling', 'young', 'actress', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'directionless', 'searching', 'soul', 'who', 'Jan', 'so', 'many', 'protests', 'exploitation', 'oppression', 'still', 'oppressed', 'exploited', 'Peter', 'somewhat', 'nave', 'idealist', 'who', 'early', 'tells', 'Jule', 'always', 'go', 'brightest', 'colors', 'when', 'choosing', 'ice', 'cream', 'flavor.Apparently', 'writer/director', 'Hans', 'Weingartner', 'took', 'latter', 'words', 'heart', 'making', 'movie', 'been', 'ages', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'such', 'vivid', 'vibrant', 'hues', 'film', 'chaotic', 'neon', 'boisterous', 'Berlin', 'cityscape', 'pastoral', 'calm', 'countryside', 'movie', 'awash', 'breathtaking', 'color.The', 'same', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'characters', 'may', 'start', 'as', 'seemingly', 'one-dimensional', 'archetypes', 'many', 'shades', 'light', 'dark', 'emerge', 'well-acted', 'portrait', 'when', 'complications', 'arise', 'young', 'revolutionaries', 'activities', 'always', 'do', 'when', 'one', 'one', 'dreams', 'action', 'end', 'up', 'opposite', 'sides', 'standoff', 'remarkable', 'similarities', 'are', 'discovered.The', 'Edukators', 'deftly', 'mixes', 'politics', 'mind', 'politics', 'heart', 'whips', 'heady', 'suspenseful', 'stew', 'small', 'amount', 'suspense', 'was', 'created', 'own', 'worries', 'film', 'neared', 'conclusion', 'was', 'way', 'end', 'satisfactory', 'way', 'happily', 'was', 'wrong', '.And', 'DVD', 'real', 'extras', '2', 'hours', '10', 'minutes', 'such', 'satisfying', 'sumptuous', 'cinematic', 'goodness', 'can', 'really', 'bite', 'off', 'more', 'when', ""'re"", 'already', 'so', 'full']",The Edukators

Stokes,"[4, 5]","Peter (Stipe Erceg) and Jan (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) are friends with a mission: they break into the homes of the ridiculously wealthy, not to steal, but to rearrange the furniture and leave a message saying ""your days of plenty are numbered,"" (die fetten Jahre sind vorbei) signed ""The Edukators.""Peter's girlfriend Jule (Julia Jentsch) has her own reasons for being angry with the ridiculously wealthy: she's perpetually broke, slowly paying a man named Hardenberg (Burghart Klau&szlig;ner) the cost of a high-end Mercedes from an accident when she didn't have insurance. At her low-wage job, it'll be years before she pays it off.When Peter's out of town, she and Jan spend time together, getting closer, and Jan tells her about The Edukators. Jule convinces Jan that her nemesis is the perfect subject for the scheme. However, while they're rearranging his house, Hardenberg returns home, catches them, and recognizes Jule.Panicking, they take him hostage, and then call Peter to come rescue them, and they all end up in a secluded cabin in the mountains while they think about their options.I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie that seemed to promise to be a sociopolitical drama, but after the first 20 minutes or so, I was hooked. It did make me think--a lot--about social problems, but it was the characters that grabbed me.The young trio were very realistically frustrated, both with the injustices they saw and with their inability to effect change. And yet, they're just playing at being revolutionaries--their big statements are a cross between a prank and performance art. The romantic triangle was also very well done, and played into their motivations--specifically, the different relationships between Jan and Jule and Peter and Jule, and between Jan and Peter were distinct and the events in the film changed those relationships.Hardenberg was even more thought-provoking, as he reveals his history as a 60s radical himself, and his journey into becoming one of the ultra-rich.Probably not coincidentally, it was also around the 20-minute mark that I started ignoring the subtitles and just listening to the dialogue in German. There's a huge difference for me in being able to understand a movie when it's originally in German as opposed to being dubbed. Lots more syllables in German than in English, so the actors in dubbed movies talk really fast--not so good for the less-than-fluent.",5,compelling characters,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,2409,"['Peter', 'Stipe', 'Erceg', 'Jan', 'Daniel', 'Br', 'uuml', 'hl', 'are', 'mission', 'break', 'homes', 'ridiculously', 'wealthy', 'not', 'steal', 'rearrange', 'furniture', 'leave', 'message', 'saying', 'days', 'plenty', 'are', 'numbered', 'die', 'fetten', 'Jahre', 'sind', 'vorbei', 'signed', 'Edukators', 'Peter', 'girlfriend', 'Jule', 'Julia', 'Jentsch', 'own', 'reasons', 'being', 'angry', 'ridiculously', 'wealthy', 'perpetually', 'broke', 'slowly', 'paying', 'man', 'named', 'Hardenberg', 'Burghart', 'Klau', 'szlig', 'cost', 'high-end', 'Mercedes', 'accident', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'insurance', 'low-wage', 'job', ""'ll"", 'be', 'years', 'off.When', 'Peter', 'town', 'Jan', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'getting', 'closer', 'Jan', 'Edukators', 'Jule', 'convinces', 'Jan', 'nemesis', 'perfect', 'subject', 'scheme', 'However', ""'re"", 'rearranging', 'house', 'Hardenberg', 'home', 'Jule.Panicking', 'take', 'hostage', 'then', 'call', 'Peter', 'come', 'rescue', 'end', 'up', 'secluded', 'cabin', 'mountains', 'think', 'options.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'seemed', 'promise', 'be', 'sociopolitical', 'drama', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'was', 'hooked', 'did', 'make', 'think', 'lot', 'social', 'problems', 'was', 'characters', 'grabbed', 'me.The', 'young', 'trio', 'were', 'very', 'realistically', 'frustrated', 'injustices', 'saw', 'inability', 'effect', 'change', 'yet', ""'re"", 'just', 'playing', 'being', 'revolutionaries', 'big', 'statements', 'are', 'cross', 'prank', 'performance', 'art', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'played', 'motivations', 'specifically', 'different', 'relationships', 'Jan', 'Jule', 'Peter', 'Jule', 'Jan', 'Peter', 'were', 'distinct', 'events', 'film', 'changed', 'relationships.Hardenberg', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'thought-provoking', 'history', '60s', 'radical', 'journey', 'becoming', 'one', 'ultra-rich.Probably', 'not', 'coincidentally', 'was', 'also', '20-minute', 'mark', 'started', 'ignoring', 'subtitles', 'just', 'listening', 'dialogue', 'German', 'huge', 'difference', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'movie', 'when', 'originally', 'German', 'opposed', 'being', 'dubbed', 'Lots', 'more', 'syllables', 'German', 'English', 'actors', 'dubbed', 'movies', 'talk', 'really', 'fast', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'less-than-fluent']",The Edukators

291051,A328S9RN3U5M68,6302020816,Grady Harp,"[9, 12]","'Die Fetten Jahre sind vorbei' or THE EDUKATORS has a message, a message that deals with the 'education' of the captains of industry by the idealistic socially conscious rebels among the youth AND the 'education' of those rebellious youths by the world wise/weary hoarders of wealth whose life change resulted from being the rebellious youth of yesteryear. The dichotomy of opinions makes for a thoughtful and thought-provoking diatribe that lifts this film from an action movie into the realm of a psychological 'thriller' of sorts.Peter (Stipe Erceg) and Jan (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) have been close friends for fifteen years, share a flat, and spend their time attacking the corrupt society in which they resentfully find themselves by breaking in to wealthy peoples homes while the owners are away, rearranging all the furniture and leaving notes that inform them their days of lifestyle are doomed.  They do not steal or damage: their acts are political and philosophical statements.  Jan is the more idealistic of the two and also the more reclusive.  Peter is gregarious and finds a live-in girlfriend Jule (Julia Jentsch) who slowly becomes attracted to Jan, more for bonding than for Peter's physical emphasis.  Jule confesses to Jan that the reason she cannot accompany the good-hearted Peter on a trip to Spain is that she is deeply in debt, the result of an accident in her old car with a new Mercedes belonging to an older wealthy man Hardenburg (Burghart Klau&szlig;ner) who is making Jule pay him the 100,000 Euros the car cost him.  Jule is complying but is resentful that a man of wealth is so money conscious that he has overlooked the fact that his demands have made her life intolerable.  When Jule is informed of Peter's and Jan's night capers, she suggests the trio make Hardenburg's home their next ploy.  The result of a bluster, the trio is discovered by Hardenburg and they opt to kidnap him to prevent their going to jail.Retreating to a country cabin the now 'quartet' slowly come to understand each other, with Hardenburg confessing that in his youth he too was a hippie and a member of a similarly socially conscious gang.  He reminisces and gains the trio's respect, is instrumental in revealing the fact the what he believes is a m&eacute;nage a trois is in reality a changing of partners for Jule, preferring Jan to Peter.  How this new information alters the plans of the kidnapping and its resolution is the climax of the film and accompanies some surprises best left to the individual viewer's enjoyment.The actors are uniformly excellent:  Daniel Br&uuml;hl is rapidly growing into a very fine actor and Julia Jentsch is most assuredly a new actor to watch.  The film gets a bit long in the tooth for the static situation of the final half, but the impact of the ending rescues the story from any flaws it may have had. Director Hans Weingartner understands the fine line between message films and entertaining movies and succeeds briskly with this one.  THE EDUKATORS leaves us with food for thought no matter the age group - current rebels or aged rebels!  Highly recommended.

It's mostly about the excessive consumerism that drives Western capitalist economies and societies.  But there is also a very intense personal element.In the beginning I found myself caring about the 3 main characters.  Later the tension mounts through the ambiguity of some nicely executed plot devices.  The enjoyment is not just the suspense of what will happen but of whether the characters will keep the faith in their ideals and their friends.  The unfolding process as the 3 sort out their choices is artfully done and sometimes with a sweet subtle touch.I won't reveal much of the plot because other reviews do that extensively (although perhaps too much).  The ending was good.  One character makes a statement and from that the ending just flows to a natural conclusion.  The ambiguity stays intact however through to the final scene.  I thought it was pitch perfect even though a good deal of the device at the end has been used before.The acting was wonderful.  I was delighted to see Julia Jentsch in this.  I saw her in ""I Served the King of England"" only a few months ago and enjoyed her performance in that also.Amazon is offering this at $11 and I would happily pay that to have this in my film library.  However, this is a little off beat for the mass market in the US and one might be able to find a slightly pre-viewed copy at certain retailers for $4.  This is a film I know I will enjoy watching again - and soon.I'm tempted to give it 5 stars, but there are a couple of slight flaws that bother me and there are no extra features.

291056,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,6302020816,Lleu Christopher,"[14, 14]","The Edukators is a very interesting German film, directed by Hans Weingartner, about three young radicals whose ideals are put to the test. We at first observe them taking part in fairly commonplace demonstrations against global trade. These are people, however, who are determined to take things beyond the level of protest.  Jan and Peter are friends who break into the homes of affluent people and, instead of stealing anything, simply rearrange the furniture and other items. They leave a calling card with the message, ""Your days of plenty are numbered,"" and sign it ""The Edukators."" The premise is in itself fascinating and leads to some humorous scenes as well as provoking thought. The humor comes from seeing the absurd relocation of objects, such as putting a stereo in the refrigerator. This is, rather than conventional vandalism, a kind of performance art, meant to create uneasiness and self-examination on the part of the victims.While Peter is out of town, his girlfriend Jule and Jan spend time together and become attracted to each other. After Jan introduces Jule to the Edukators' tactics, Jule convinces him to help her ""visit"" the home of a businessman to whom she owes a large sum of money following a car accident. The man catches them and they end up kidnapping him, bringing Peter into the action. The rest of the film follows the three friends as they decide what to do with their victim and debate politics with him. Some of these discussions are interesting, though they inevitably follow a predictable course (""you are a parasite living off the poor"" vs. ""I have a right to what I earned,"" to paraphrase). The businessman, however, moves from arguing with his captors to sympathizing with them, explaining that he was once a radical himself. Is this for real or merely a ploy to gain their trust? The romantic triangle further escalates the tension.I liked the intellectual content of The Edukators; it reminds us of how few films today deal sympathetically with characters who are not only outside the system, but actively oppose it. Even better, the movie does not simply romanticize the radicals and demonize the businessman. It actually raises more questions than it answers, which is probably a good thing. It is not a perfect film; some of the situations seem a bit contrived (e.g. one of them is an expert at deactivating burglar alarms because he used to work for a security company).  The ending is more of a clever punchline than a serious resolution of matters. Still, it is very engaging and well-acted and puts a new face on the old dilemma of participating in vs. fighting mainstream society.",4,An original form of protest,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2636,"['Edukators', 'very', 'interesting', 'German', 'film', 'directed', 'Hans', 'Weingartner', 'three', 'young', 'radicals', 'ideals', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'first', 'observe', 'taking', 'part', 'fairly', 'commonplace', 'demonstrations', 'global', 'trade', 'are', 'people', 'however', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'take', 'things', 'level', 'protest', 'Jan', 'Peter', 'are', 'friends', 'who', 'break', 'homes', 'affluent', 'people', 'instead', 'stealing', 'anything', 'simply', 'rearrange', 'furniture', 'other', 'items', 'leave', 'calling', 'card', 'message', 'days', 'plenty', 'are', 'numbered', 'sign', 'Edukators', 'premise', 'fascinating', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'provoking', 'thought', 'humor', 'seeing', 'absurd', 'relocation', 'objects', 'such', 'putting', 'stereo', 'refrigerator', 'rather', 'conventional', 'vandalism', 'kind', 'performance', 'art', 'meant', 'create', 'uneasiness', 'self-examination', 'part', 'victims.While', 'Peter', 'town', 'girlfriend', 'Jule', 'Jan', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'become', 'attracted', 'other', 'Jan', 'Jule', 'Edukators', 'tactics', 'Jule', 'help', 'visit', 'home', 'businessman', 'whom', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'following', 'car', 'accident', 'man', 'end', 'up', 'kidnapping', 'bringing', 'Peter', 'action', 'rest', 'film', 'three', 'friends', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'victim', 'debate', 'politics', 'discussions', 'are', 'interesting', 'inevitably', 'follow', 'predictable', 'course', 'are', 'parasite', 'living', 'poor', 'have', 'right', 'what', 'earned', 'paraphrase', 'businessman', 'however', 'moves', 'arguing', 'captors', 'sympathizing', 'explaining', 'was', 'once', 'radical', 'real', 'merely', 'ploy', 'gain', 'trust', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'further', 'tension.I', 'liked', 'intellectual', 'content', 'Edukators', 'how', 'few', 'films', 'today', 'deal', 'sympathetically', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'system', 'actively', 'oppose', 'Even', 'better', 'movie', 'not', 'simply', 'romanticize', 'radicals', 'demonize', 'businessman', 'actually', 'more', 'questions', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'situations', 'seem', 'bit', 'contrived', 'e.g', 'one', 'expert', 'deactivating', 'burglar', 'alarms', 'used', 'work', 'security', 'company', 'ending', 'more', 'clever', 'punchline', 'serious', 'resolution', 'matters', 'Still', 'very', 'engaging', 'well-acted', 'new', 'face', 'old', 'dilemma', 'participating', 'vs.', 'fighting', 'mainstream', 'society']",The Edukators
