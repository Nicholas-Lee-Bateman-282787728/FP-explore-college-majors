481982,A2GDEPPC8BAZRY,6305892806,"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V""","[5, 9]","Here I be - oncemore reviewing a Jane Austen adaptation that is not quite true to the novel from which it is contrived.  And here oncemore do I  sanction one and give unto it my blessing.  (Sometimes I shock myself.)  Yet I cannot deny that I found this movie charming.  I must say that  Frances O'Connor gives a more openly formidable spirit in Fanny than the  subtle and silent brick wall of a spirit in the Fanny of the novel.  So,  here's the scoop:Fanny, the oldest daughter in a near-impoverish family  of many children, goes to live with her mother's sister, Lady Bertram's,  family on a large estate.  Another aunt, Mrs. Norris, secures Fanny's  position in the family as a sort of servant to wait upon her aunt and act  as a sort of &quot;savage&quot; companion to Lady Bertram's daughters,  Maria and Julia.  Alone in her attic room with no fire, Fanny writes  incessantly clever little stories and letters to her family - and over the  years of her childhood and blooming womanhood develops a close friendship  with the Bertram's second son, Edmund.  Everything is quaint and peaceful  until a brother &amp; sister, Henry and Mary Crawford, move into the  parsonage on the estate.  As the Bertram sisters, one of whom is engaged  and set to marry another man, flirt with and swoon over Henry, Edmund  determines to woo Mary, who welcomes it notwithstanding the fact that that  he is only the 2nd son and would not inherit the estate.  In the meantime,  Henry sets his sights intently on Fanny - who is by now in love with  Edmund.So sets things into motion.  The movie differs from the book,  however, in not only several blatant characteristics in Fanny, but also  distinct differences in Edmund's feelings toward his little cousin.  The  source of the Bertram's wealth - only vaguely referenced in the novel -  provide in this movie a much darker view of humanity than I think Austen  would have even conceived. But forgiving all that, I'll happily admit I  shall - as with all the Jane Austen movie adaptations - watch this charmer  several times again!",4,Well Enough,966643200,"08 19, 2000",2000,2067,"['Here', 'be', 'reviewing', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'adaptation', 'not', 'quite', 'true', 'novel', 'contrived', 'here', 'oncemore', 'do', 'sanction', 'one', 'give', 'unto', 'blessing', 'Sometimes', 'shock', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'found', 'movie', 'charming', 'must', 'say', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'more', 'openly', 'formidable', 'spirit', 'Fanny', 'subtle', 'silent', 'brick', 'wall', 'spirit', 'Fanny', 'novel', 'So', 'here', 'scoop', 'Fanny', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'near-impoverish', 'family', 'many', 'children', 'live', 'mother', 'sister', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'family', 'large', 'estate', 'aunt', 'Mrs.', 'Norris', 'Fanny', 'position', 'family', 'sort', 'servant', 'wait', 'aunt', 'act', 'sort', 'quot', 'savage', 'quot', 'companion', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'daughters', 'Maria', 'Julia', 'Alone', 'attic', 'room', 'fire', 'Fanny', 'incessantly', 'clever', 'little', 'stories', 'letters', 'family', 'years', 'childhood', 'blooming', 'womanhood', 'close', 'friendship', 'Bertram', 'second', 'son', 'Edmund', 'Everything', 'quaint', 'peaceful', 'brother', 'amp', 'sister', 'Henry', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'move', 'parsonage', 'estate', 'Bertram', 'sisters', 'one', 'whom', 'engaged', 'set', 'marry', 'man', 'flirt', 'swoon', 'Henry', 'Edmund', 'woo', 'Mary', 'who', 'notwithstanding', 'fact', 'only', '2nd', 'son', 'would', 'not', 'inherit', 'estate', 'meantime', 'Henry', 'sights', 'intently', 'Fanny', 'who', 'now', 'love', 'Edmund.So', 'sets', 'things', 'motion', 'movie', 'differs', 'book', 'however', 'not', 'only', 'several', 'blatant', 'characteristics', 'Fanny', 'also', 'distinct', 'differences', 'Edmund', 'feelings', 'little', 'cousin', 'source', 'Bertram', 'wealth', 'only', 'vaguely', 'referenced', 'novel', 'provide', 'movie', 'much', 'darker', 'view', 'humanity', 'think', 'Austen', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'conceived', 'forgiving', ""'ll"", 'happily', 'admit', 'shall', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'again']",Mansfield Park VHS

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 4]","Mansfield Park is one of the more problematic of the Austen creations, mostly because of the heroine, Fanny Brice, who maddens readers with her passivity, goodness and inability to take any initiative. Her method is to be good and wait for good things to happen to her. Of course, ultimately they do when she captures the heart of her drippy cousin Edmund.This movie inserts a few little touches to ""bring it up to date,"" notably a few allusions to the evils of slavery upon which the Mansfield Park finances depend (there is a distant, unseen sugar plantation in Antigua) and also a slight hint of lesbianism which is enough to titillate the senses but no more.If you don't expect too much, we have all the traditional Austen themes in plentiful supply -- the obligatory ball, the walks in the country, a bit of horse riding, a little hint of poverty, a little sexual politics, a rake, a scheming gold digger etc etc.It's fine for an evening in front of the fire.

Despite the slightly rushed pace, it has characters with some depth, a twisted coil of relationships and the lovely Frances O'Conner. However, if you have read the novel, this movie will be atrocious to watch. This director clearly had a certain agenda she wanted to push and Mansfield Park was the unfortunate story she picked to convey that.She tries to make all the characters complex and well-rounded, with tangled emotions of real life. While admirable, the results are rather unbelievable in places and, for fans of the novel, completely ridiculous.  The characters of Tom, Mr. Bertram, Mr. Price and even the main character, Fanny Price, are unrecognizable!  Rather than the carefree, spendthrift Tom of the book, we're given a passionate, rebellious and very moralistic young man.  Worst however is the representation of Fanny.  No longer the unassuming and submissive girl Austen wrote of, she is now outspoken, bold and almost disrespectful, to the point where she is even told she has a tongue ""sharp as a guillotine"".The director clearly had some social concerns she wanted addressed--namely slavery and the effects (both positive and negative) of education as well as the possibility of re-educating someone into an entirely different person, much like this movie which is quite different from the book.  Those are fine topics that are not a part of Mansfield Park. And while these are very serious topics, the pacing and tone of this movie is light and comedic which does away with much (if not all) of the necessary gravity.All in all, unless you are unfamiliar with Austen or are a huge O'Conner fan, save yourself 2 hours and don't bother watching.",1,has its own agenda,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,1772,"['are', 'not', 'Austen', 'fan', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'slightly', 'rushed', 'pace', 'characters', 'depth', 'twisted', 'coil', 'relationships', 'lovely', 'Frances', ""O'Conner"", 'However', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'atrocious', 'watch', 'director', 'clearly', 'had', 'certain', 'agenda', 'wanted', 'push', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'story', 'picked', 'convey', 'that.She', 'tries', 'make', 'characters', 'complex', 'well-rounded', 'tangled', 'emotions', 'real', 'life', 'admirable', 'results', 'are', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'places', 'fans', 'novel', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Mr.', 'Bertram', 'Mr.', 'Price', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'are', 'unrecognizable', 'Rather', 'carefree', 'spendthrift', 'Tom', 'book', ""'re"", 'given', 'passionate', 'rebellious', 'very', 'moralistic', 'young', 'man', 'Worst', 'however', 'representation', 'Fanny', 'No', 'longer', 'unassuming', 'submissive', 'girl', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'now', 'outspoken', 'bold', 'almost', 'disrespectful', 'point', 'where', 'even', 'told', 'tongue', 'sharp', 'guillotine', '.The', 'director', 'clearly', 'had', 'social', 'concerns', 'wanted', 'addressed', 'namely', 'slavery', 'effects', 'positive', 'negative', 'education', 'as', 'well', 'possibility', 're-educating', 'someone', 'entirely', 'different', 'person', 'much', 'movie', 'quite', 'different', 'book', 'are', 'fine', 'topics', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'are', 'very', 'serious', 'topics', 'pacing', 'tone', 'movie', 'light', 'comedic', 'away', 'much', 'not', 'necessary', 'gravity.All', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Austen', 'are', 'huge', ""O'Conner"", 'fan', 'save', '2', 'hours', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching']",Mansfield Park VHS

481989,A2YNCVR2LX325X,6305892806,"Amazon Customer ""mm2kanda""","[0, 0]","Enjoyable version of Mansfield Park.  The romanticized lives of Jane Austen characters once again brought to life on the big screen (in in the case of home, littler screen).  This version does have it's differences if you've seen the version with Billie Piper (2007).This is the quintessential Miramax film of the 90's.Young Fanny Price (the &#34;poor&#34; relative) is sent to live with her Aunt Mrs. Norris (a woman slightly snobbish for being a minister's wife) but as she arrives she's passed off to her mother's other sister Lady Bertram, a woman who is just as attached to her Pug as she is her morphine (or possibly Laudanum).Even though not living in the same household Mrs. Norris finds it her business to always remind Fanny she's a burden on her relatives even going as far as not letting fanny have a fire in her room.  Lady Bertram has 4 children; Eldest son Tom, Edmond and two spoiled and vain daughters Maria and Julia.  Edmond is the only cousin to show Fanny a true kindness and help her with her education.Franny gives us narration through the movie.  Some very funny.  Many in the tune of her writing her sister Susan.Sir Thomas and Tom leave for the Antigua (The West Indies) for a year one to deal with issues at the plantation and hopes to straighten up Tom.  It only makes matters worse. Tom returns home early after some time drinking and gambling.About the time of Franny's 18th year the household gets very wealthy, fashionable visitors siblings to the new parson's wife.  Henry and Mary Crawford.  Mary sets her sights on Tom since he is the eldest (she ends up meeting Edmond first since Tom was gone when they first arrived at Mansfield park) and heir to the families fortune but settles for Edmond even though she's disappointed he wants to be a clergymen.  She considers this dull and unfashionable.  She tries to convince Edmond that he should go into law or something a little less &#34;boring&#34;.Henry also makes a play for both of the sisters even though by now Maria is engaged to marry Mr. Rushworth a very rich young man.  Henry's affections toward both young ladies divides them apart and Maria starts to ignore Mr. Rushworth to show more affection to Mr. Crawford.  Fanny sits back and watches everything going on with very keen eyes and a new feeling that she didn't realize before.  She was becoming jealous of Edmond and Mary.When Tom comes back home with his drinking and gambling companion they convince everyone they should through a play.  At first Edmond and Fanny protest that the idea would be something Sir Thomas would disapprove of but as time goes on Edmund caves in and takes a part in the play which has him playing the lover of the character Mary is playing.  Fanny continues to disapprove of the play and it's subject matter but she just sits back quietly and watches it all gone on around her like she's invisible.Sir Thomas arrives home early and the play is then terminated.Henry Crawford soon leaves leaving Maria heartbroken and even though she has no love for Mr. Rushworth she asks her father to allow her to marry in a fortnight.  They soon take off for their honeymoon and Maria takes Julia with her on her honeymoon to Brighton.Fanny's improved appearance and gentle disposition endear her to Sir Thomas, who begins treating her a bit less distantly.  Mary Crawford Mary goes out of her way to befriend Fanny hoping it will endear her to Edmond and Sir Thomas.Henry returns to Mansfield Park and decides to now set his sights on Franny.  This decision is mostly just to amuse himself.Franny is harder to get affections out of then Henry ever expected and he tries all sorts of smooth moves including using his influence to get Franny's brother a commission as a naval lieutenant (this isn't really discussed in this movie compared to other versions).  Henry even proposes marriage but for the fact she watched everything he did to her two cousins she turns him down because she doesn't trust that he really loves her.  Sir Thomas is dumbfounded by Franny turning down such an advantageous marriage.  Sir Thomas believes Franny doesn't know her own feelings and persuades Henry to stay persistent.  To remind Franny of what her life could be like he sends her back home to her family in Portsmouth.  She's been away from home for about 8 years now and other then really enjoying seeing her younger sister who is now a beautiful young lady herself she really does discover the fear of living in filth and poverty and it starts to scare her.  Henry comes to Portsmouth and introduces himself to her family.  Attempts grand gestures to get Franny's attention and asks her again.  She accepts (possibly out of the fear of ending up as poor as her mother).  She wakes the next day to realize she's made a huge mistake and takes back her yes and an angry Henry storms off.  Soon Edmond shows up to bring Franny back to Mansfield Park as Tom has become deathly ill after basically drinking himself to a near death then being left my his &#34;friends&#34;.  On the very long ride back to Mansfield some of those feelings between Franny and Edmond peak through.  The brush of a hand you can nearly sense the tension between the two.  Edmond falls asleep on Franny's chest as they ride together in the carriage through the night.  As Franny starts to actually get a sense of herself and the fact she is needed in this family she finally stands up to her mouthy and flippant aunt Mrs. Norris who is always putting Fanny down.  Henry and Mary come back to be near the family in their &#34;time of need&#34;.Franny hears a noise during the night and goes to check on Tom when she walks in on Henry and Maria in the throws of passion.  She is utterly stunned and Edmond coming to check on things goes into the room where Franny points to also discover his married sister in bed with a man other then her husband.Stunned he to walks away.The next morning bright and early Mr. Rushworth comes barging in with a &#34;newspaper&#34; man in the area to interview Mr. Rushworth on his new gardens.  Mr. Rushworth bounding through the house asking where everyone is and asking where his wife is is told she must be at the cottage (he states he already stopped there).  Continuing to look for Maria, Mr. Rushworth opens a door to discover an empty disheveled bed with two wine glasses on the floor.  He knows right away what has happened.  Maria runs off with Henry but is soon without a husband or a lover (he doesn't ask her to marry him).  Tom still ill the family is at it's wits end with how to handle everything and also deal with the embarrassment of Maria's affair and divorce.Mary soon speaks up with her idea's how Sir Thomas should handle everything.  The family is so aghast with her blatant disregard for Tom's life and ease of dismissing Sir Thomas that Edmond finally stands up to her and tells her he doesn't know her and wants nothing further to do with her.  She slinks off.  Sir Thomas finally sees Franny's true value and self-worth and finally sees the fact that Edmond and Franny are in love.  The family is happy with the attachment at last.  Tom starts to slowly recover.  Franny's younger sister Susan comes to live at Mansfield Park and starts to become educated as Franny once was.  This time she's taken under Julia's wing.  We get a lovely narration at the end of the families current goings on...Maria and Aunt Norris' always makes me chuckle.",4,The wonders of Jane Austen  ***Spoiler Alert***,1399939200,"05 13,

Yes, I too was frustrated by Jonny Lee Miller's Edmund - he should have been adamantly beating the drums about his feelings towards Fanny.  Instead, he comes across as meek and unable to speak his mind.  Sure, this is #2 son in the face of a gale force of a father (awesome portrayal by a brilliant Harold Pinter), but as Edmund increasingly fails to state the obvious (that he loves Fanny ""as a man loves a woman"" - as he finally lets out), you wonder: why again is she attracted to this man?  Like most of Austen's work, you spend the entire movie wanting to conk together the heads of the two protagonists who are clearly destined to be together.Jonny Lee Miller (Eli Stone: The Complete First Season) reminds me of Tom Brady.  I half expected Giselle to bound into the screen.  Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davitz are excellent as the Crawford siblings.  Nivola and Davidtz played man and wife in the underrated dramaJunebug.

However, if, like me, you don't like to miss out on ANY romantic period drama with a beautiful cast and costumes, then you may want to pick up this video.PLUS POINTS of the movie as I see it:-1) great chemistry between the heroine, Fanny Price and her 2  suitors i.e. Henry Crawford (or &quot;the rake&quot;, as Fanny calls  him) and Edmund Bertram (the kind cousin whom Fanny secretly  loves). I personally enjoy the scenes involving Fanny and  Henry Crawford (rake or no rake) because he's truly in love  with her and tries so hard (and in so many romantic ways) to  win her heart.2) gorgeous costumes, lavish balls, lovely music and romantic  waltzes.3) brilliant acting all around and a beautiful cast (including  Frances  O'Connor's &quot;Fanny Price&quot;, Jonny Lee Miller and  Justine Waddell).The movie's not without its FLAWS, EVEN IGNORING the fact that the screenplay deviates quite heavily from the Austen novel:-1) After watching the movie, I begin to see some of the other  reviewers' points of view on the total lack of neccessity in  introducing the subject of &quot;slavery&quot; into the story. This sub-  sub plot is very incoherent and jars terribly with the  overall story and also takes away some of the pleasures of  enjoying this supposedly light-hearted romance. Also, since  the &quot;issue&quot; is left &quot;hanging&quot; (unresolved) in the end after  its brutal introduction, what's the point of the director  introducing it in the first place?2) The few scenes in which Fanny Price literally &quot;speaks&quot;  to the camera is truly irritating and unreal. A voice-over  would've been preferred so that the effect is more believable  and doesn't seem as &quot;weird&quot;.3) I can't understand why the Fanny Price here (who's sweet-  natured, kindly and charming throughout the movie) all of a  sudden exhibits a Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde personality during the  LAST scene, when she LOOKS triumphantly (and with an almost  evil-like smile) into the camera while in the arms of the man  she finally secures.

This one is by far the least faithful to the novel.  In the movie, Fanny Price is a combination of the book character and Jane Austen herself.  Fanny is always writing and the writing is quoted from Jane Austen's Juvenalia.  If that weren't bad enough, Edmund is portrayed as weak-willed, Lady Betram is addicted to laudanum, and Sir Thomas Betram is a cruel slave owner.  Things only subtly hinted at in the orginal novel are exaggerated into graphic detail in the movie.  I can tolerate a few liberties with the original book but this is nowhere near it.  My husband who hasn't read the book says it's an OK period piece.  I can't stand it because although the plot is similar to the book, the characters bear almost no resemblence to their literal counterparts.  The actress playing Fanny is pretty but she's far too old to play a 17 or 18 year old girl.  Jonny Lee Miller, who makes a good Mr. Knightly in the latest version of Emma, is simply OK as Edmund in this.  If you want a decent version of Mansfield Park, I recommend the old BBC version with Sylvestra LaTouzel (hopefully spelling that right) as Fanny Price.

So far I've read and seen the most recent BBC version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;--a bit of a slow start I'll admit lol I did get most of her books from the library though and am actually reading &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; right now. It's definitely slow compared to P &amp; P, but good enough to keep reading. The movie is kind of chop-sockey, incorporating things from the book in random order with no real point, especially the whole slavery thing. In defense of the movie though, at least it moves a lot faster than the book and while I'm only half way through, it's amazing what Frances O'Connor has down with the character of Fanny Price. I actually liked the Fanny in the movie, the Fanny in the book on the other hand is such a simpering goody-goody moron I want to slap her. Sorry, but she feels evil about the stupidest things, and while those around her ARE corrupt at least they have fun. Example : When Edmund asks for her opinion on something, Fanny gasps and goes &quot;My opinion&quot; like it's the grandest honor next to being invited for tea with the queen. Must admit that my favorite character in the movie was Henry Crawford; I felt sorry when Fanny rejected him, and I'll probably hate her in the book for it, but in the movie I could see why she did it. She had no way of knowing whether his affections were truly sincere or would stay that way. Worth watching if you're an Austen fan and not nearly as boring as the book, but not great. I have no idea why Fanny Price was one of Jane Austen's favorite heroines though; Emma was a little irritating in her over-perfectness, but not nearly as annoying and Elizabeth Bennet is definitley my favorite thusfar. The whole reason her and Mr. Darcy were perfect for eachother was because they saw the superficialness in their society and what they said wasn't as important as the underlying meaning of their words. Fanny Price on the other hand would NEVER say or think anything bad against anyone without feeling that she should get down on her knees and pray intensely for forgiveness.",3,Um...,996364800,"07 29, 2001",2001,2171,"['rented', 'movie', 'quot', 'Emma', 'quot', 'one', 'night', 'goal', 'absorb', 'nearly', 'everything', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'far', ""'ve"", 'read', 'seen', 'most', 'recent', 'BBC', 'version', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'bit', 'slow', 'start', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'lol', 'did', 'get', 'most', 'books', 'library', 'though', 'am', 'actually', 'reading', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'right', 'now', 'definitely', 'slow', 'compared', 'P', 'amp', 'P', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'reading', 'movie', 'kind', 'chop-sockey', 'incorporating', 'things', 'book', 'random', 'order', 'real', 'point', 'especially', 'whole', 'slavery', 'thing', 'defense', 'movie', 'least', 'lot', 'faster', 'book', ""'m"", 'only', 'half', 'way', 'amazing', 'what', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'down', 'character', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'actually', 'liked', 'Fanny', 'movie', 'Fanny', 'book', 'other', 'hand', 'such', 'simpering', 'goody-goody', 'moron', 'want', 'slap', 'Sorry', 'evil', 'stupidest', 'things', 'ARE', 'corrupt', 'least', 'have', 'fun', 'Example', 'When', 'Edmund', 'opinion', 'something', 'Fanny', 'gasps', 'quot', 'My', 'opinion', 'quot', 'grandest', 'honor', 'next', 'being', 'invited', 'tea', 'queen', 'Must', 'admit', 'favorite', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'felt', 'sorry', 'when', 'Fanny', 'rejected', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'hate', 'book', 'movie', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'did', 'had', 'way', 'knowing', 'affections', 'were', 'truly', 'sincere', 'would', 'stay', 'way', 'watching', ""'re"", 'Austen', 'fan', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'boring', 'book', 'not', 'great', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'was', 'one', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'favorite', 'heroines', 'Emma', 'was', 'little', 'irritating', 'over-perfectness', 'not', 'nearly', 'annoying', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'definitley', 'favorite', 'thusfar', 'whole', 'reason', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'were', 'perfect', 'was', 'saw', 'superficialness', 'society', 'what', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'underlying', 'meaning', 'words', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'NEVER', 'say', 'think', 'anything', 'bad', 'anyone', 'feeling', 'should', 'get', 'down', 'knees', 'pray', 'intensely', 'forgiveness']",Mansfield Park VHS

I also watched the video series of it, made years earlier than this version, and  found that series very faithful to the novel. I found it hard to get beyond  the plainly unattractive, placid heroine. So I didn't like it very much  either.  This newest version is a more modern adaptation with a markedly  different heroine, one who resembles Elizabeth Bennett of &quot;Pride &amp;  Prejudice&quot;.  I liked this version much more than the novel or the  earlier video series.  However, it still comes in behind the newest  versions of &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (Colin Firth) and &quot;Sense  and Sensibility&quot; (Emma Thompson).  I enjoyed the slave trade wealth of  the family being brought into this film as well as (cousin) Tom's stunning  drawings of the abuse of slaves, which Fanny discovers while he is ill. For  the first time, I found Fanny's love interest attractive.  This is her  cousin Edmund, a future clergyman, played by Johnny Lee Miller, who is  already a film heartthrob.  The romance of the piece is a lot more  believable with such attractive leads at the heart of it.  The father of  the family, acted by playwright Harold Pinter, is a much darker character  than he is in earlier versions.  This is a plus to this version as well.  Austen purists may have problems with this film version but everyone else  should give it a try.

It may not be exactly what Austen wrote, but it is still a very worthwhile film.The somewhat heavy-handed treatment of slavery and frank portrayal of sexuality and infidelity may make some Austenites squirm, as these issues were really only hinted at in the novel.  In Austen's time, a mere mention that a family was involved in business in Bristol or had perplexing interests in Antigua was enough to indicate their involvement in the slave trade.But modern audiences aren't always as acute to subtleties such as this.  Thus, Rozema's film practically hits you over the head with it, making sure you understand just how the Bertram family gets their money.Then there's the issue of sex.  Miss Austen would never have been published had she revealed any sexual details, and Austen film adaptations have followed suit, rarely showing more than a chaste kiss.  Although the heroine's (Fanny Price) love affair remains pure, Rozema makes sure that the audience understands the illicit affair between Maria Bertram and Henry Crawford by having Fanny walk in on them in the act.No, it's not the way Austen wrote it, but we aren't living in Austen's time.  And the film is not a complete perversion of the original work.The formal diction and manners remain the same; the characters are, for the most part, very true to the novel, and the underlying themes still come through strongly.  This is what matters.Furthermore, the acting is superior.  Frances O'Connor gives Fanny Price a much sharper tongue than the character in the novel, but she still portrays Fanny's extreme self-consciousness, honesty, and unworldliness.  Jonny Lee Miller's Edward Bertram is not as dashing as a Mr. Darcy, but neither is the character.  His Edward is honorable, sweet, shy, and discerning, and a perfect match for O'Connor's modest Fanny.  Lindsay Duncan is excellent in the dual roles of the wealthy opium-addict Lady Bertram and her poverty-stricken sister Mrs. Price, showing two extremes of female fate in Austen's time.What this film shows is that Austen still can be adapted for a modern audience.  It attests to Austen's sustainability as a novelist (as if that was a point necessary to argue), that the story can be subjected to the indelicacies of a contemporary film and still make an impact with its themes and characters.",4,This Ain't Your Grandma's Austen,992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,2425,"['Austen', 'purists', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'tsk-tsk', 'away', 'Patricia', 'Rozema', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'Well', 'let', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'still', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'film.The', 'somewhat', 'heavy-handed', 'treatment', 'slavery', 'frank', 'portrayal', 'sexuality', 'infidelity', 'may', 'make', 'Austenites', 'squirm', 'issues', 'were', 'really', 'only', 'hinted', 'novel', 'Austen', 'time', 'mere', 'mention', 'family', 'was', 'involved', 'business', 'Bristol', 'had', 'perplexing', 'interests', 'Antigua', 'was', 'enough', 'indicate', 'involvement', 'slave', 'trade.But', 'modern', 'audiences', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'acute', 'subtleties', 'such', 'Thus', 'Rozema', 'film', 'practically', 'head', 'making', 'sure', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'Bertram', 'family', 'money.Then', 'issue', 'sex', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'published', 'had', 'revealed', 'sexual', 'details', 'Austen', 'film', 'adaptations', 'have', 'followed', 'suit', 'rarely', 'showing', 'more', 'chaste', 'kiss', 'heroine', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'love', 'affair', 'pure', 'Rozema', 'sure', 'audience', 'illicit', 'affair', 'Maria', 'Bertram', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'having', 'Fanny', 'walk', 'act.No', 'not', 'way', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'are', ""n't"", 'living', 'Austen', 'time', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'perversion', 'original', 'work.The', 'formal', 'diction', 'manners', 'remain', 'same', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'true', 'novel', 'underlying', 'themes', 'still', 'come', 'strongly', 'what', 'matters.Furthermore', 'acting', 'superior', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'Fanny', 'Price', 'much', 'sharper', 'tongue', 'character', 'novel', 'still', 'Fanny', 'extreme', 'self-consciousness', 'honesty', 'unworldliness', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'Edward', 'Bertram', 'not', 'as', 'dashing', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'character', 'Edward', 'honorable', 'sweet', 'shy', 'discerning', 'perfect', 'match', ""O'Connor"", 'modest', 'Fanny', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'excellent', 'dual', 'roles', 'wealthy', 'opium-addict', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'poverty-stricken', 'sister', 'Mrs.', 'Price', 'showing', 'two', 'extremes', 'female', 'fate', 'Austen', 'time.What', 'film', 'Austen', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'adapted', 'modern', 'audience', 'Austen', 'sustainability', 'novelist', 'was', 'point', 'necessary', 'argue', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'subjected', 'indelicacies', 'contemporary', 'film', 'still', 'make', 'impact', 'themes', 'characters']",Mansfield Park VHS
482026,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,6305892806,CodeMaster Talon,"[273, 294]","...And so we have ""Mansfield Park"", ""loosely"" based on the Jane Austen novel of same name (although, as is mentioned in the credits, Austen's letters and non-fiction writings are also used, particularly for dialogue). The characters keep their original names, but, for the most part, not their personalities. The heroine, Fanny Price, is changed from the quiet, deeply moral character of the book into a feisty tomboy. The story follows the basic threads of the novel, but adds several subplots and individual scenes that you are not likely to find in any Austen novel (Fanny's uncle giving her the once over, Mary Crawford giving her the once over, etc.). So why the four stars?Well, as an adaptaion, the film only merits two at best. But taken by itself and judged as a movie, I have to admit it's quite entertaining. While not the Fanny of the book, as played by Frances O'Conner the Fanny of the film is extremely likable. Embeth Davidtz and the very appealing Alessandro Nivola have a lot of fun with their characters; Nivola in particular capturing the mixture of sleaziness and vulnerablity that makes the womanizing Henry Crawford ever so slightly attractive. The visuals are sumptuous, and the dialogue is laced with Austen's unique wit, much of it not in the novel. My only real problems with the film are with the slavery subplot (icky and distracting) and Johnny Lee Miller as Fanny's true love. Changing the chracters personalities also changes their motivations, and the actions of Edward, while making sense in the book, are not logical in the film. As a result, Miller's Edward comes off as wimpy and indecisive and detracts from the story.Other than these two quibbles, I quite like this little movie. You are more likely to enjoy it, I think, if you aren't comparing it to the novel the entire time, as it really has very little to do with Austen's story. Taken as a straight period film, though, ""Mansfield Park"" is an enjoyable way to spend a rainy afternoon.",4,"Might have turned out differently, I suppose.

At least, you are sure that your ears won't be hurt by the today scatological vocabulary so praised by the new  generation of directors who thinks, by using the language of the streets,  that they are making modern films. How wrong ! The themes treated by Jane  Austen in MANSFIELD PARK are more actual and universal than the 90 % of the  Hollywood screenplays of the year 1999. And I'm still nice with the old  dream factory.Jane Austen was a witty and sharp observer of the late  XVIII-early XIXth century period in England. She had the peculiar gift to  feel what was hidden behind the masks that society and the system of  classes gave to people at their birth. Her novels are little pearls of  psychology that until now have well stood the test of time. But what I  really appreciate in her books, it's the kind of black humor that reigns  through numerous pages of her work. Director Patricia Rozema has  particularly well translated in the cinema grammar this humor, specially in  the last 10 minutes of MANSFIELD PARK.Three years after SENSE AND  SENSIBILITY with Emma Thompson, MANSFIELD PARK is another excellent  adaptation of a Jane Austen novel and can only arouse your envy to  rediscover the other novels of this writer.A DVD for you and your  schoolteacher.",4,NEIGHBOURS,966124800,"08 13, 2000",2000,1310,"['OK', 'Let', 'get', 'back', 'classics', 'least', 'are', 'sure', 'ears', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'hurt', 'today', 'scatological', 'vocabulary', 'so', 'praised', 'new', 'generation', 'directors', 'who', 'thinks', 'using', 'language', 'streets', 'are', 'making', 'modern', 'films', 'How', 'wrong', 'themes', 'treated', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'are', 'more', 'actual', 'universal', '90', '%', 'Hollywood', 'screenplays', 'year', '1999', ""'m"", 'still', 'nice', 'old', 'dream', 'factory.Jane', 'Austen', 'was', 'witty', 'sharp', 'observer', 'late', 'XVIII-early', 'XIXth', 'century', 'period', 'England', 'had', 'peculiar', 'gift', 'feel', 'what', 'was', 'hidden', 'masks', 'society', 'system', 'classes', 'gave', 'people', 'birth', 'novels', 'are', 'little', 'pearls', 'psychology', 'now', 'have', 'well', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'what', 'really', 'appreciate', 'books', 'kind', 'black', 'humor', 'numerous', 'pages', 'work', 'Director', 'Patricia', 'Rozema', 'particularly', 'well', 'translated', 'cinema', 'grammar', 'humor', 'specially', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK.Three', 'years', 'SENSE', 'SENSIBILITY', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'can', 'only', 'arouse', 'envy', 'rediscover', 'other', 'novels', 'writer.A', 'DVD', 'schoolteacher']",Mansfield Park VHS

I will leave it to those in the know to make the final judgment of this movie as an accurate interpretation of the original. As a post-modern deconstruction, that is, as a director's version, if you will, of the original, it seems to me this can be evaluated on its own terms. Does it work? Is it entertaining? Is it enlightening? To these question, my answer is yes. I found the explicit references to the slave trade valid if not faithful to Austen. This is a 20th century artist's take on an injustice wrongly neglected. Tying the English country life to the source of its wealth strikes me as valid. Dramatically, it works as an explanation for the son's torment and for the father's guilt. Harold Pinter, by the way, is fantastic. The Nobel-winning playwright makes a rare appearance, offering a wonderful glimpse into this fine actor's talents. I found all of the performances convincing. I especially loved seeing Lindsey Duncan playing two roles, that of the wayward sister, strapped with a loser husband and a house full of crying babies and that of the aristocratic drug addict lying about the country house being waited on hand and foot.

482040,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6305892806,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[26, 37]","Mansfield Park is thought to have been written by Jane Austen when she was in her thirties and had seen something of life and it's misfortunes. (Her novels were not printed in the order she wrote them). Many scholars believe  it may have been her last complete novel. Her sister burned all her  correspondence when she died. She was a very private person, who did not  discuss her works and quickly covered her writing when anyone entered the  room. It is likely that all of her novels reflect aspects of her inner and  outer life at the time she wrote them. Since she never married, we might  assume she couldn't possibly have based the lives of her heroines on her  own life, but that is not so. While her heroines always get their man, they  also come very very close to losing them permanently. When I think of Ms.  Austen, I imagine she was like Elizabeth Bennet when she was younger and  Anne Elliot in &quot;Persuasion&quot; when she was older.Jane Austin  had brothers who distinguished themselves in the British Navy. I beleive  one brother was with Nelson at Trafalgar. Ms Austin's father was a vicar,  and like her character Frank in Emma, one of her brothers was raised by a  wealthy family whose name he assumed.As she lead a relatively cloistered  life with her mother and sisters (not unlike &quot;Sense and  Sensibility&quot;) she used her knowledge of other's experiences in her  novels. One of her naval brothers (who rose to Admiral from the lowest  rank--like Hornblower) wrote long letters about his adventures, very much  like Fanny Price's brother in &quot;Mansefield Park.&quot; Ms Austen  admired and loved what she knew from her brother's letters. Her sentiments  are reflected in &quot;Persuasion&quot; when one of her characters says  &quot;I do so admire these Navy men.&quot;  In reality, navy life was  extremely difficult and mutinies were commonplace.Mansefield Park is  the tale of Fanny Price, a poor little girl who is sent to live with her  relatives (shades of Jane Eyre written 30-40 years later). Fanny is not a  particularly physically attractive girl in the book or the BBC adaptation  done in the 1980s. In the film, however, Fanny is pretty and witty and  rather more like Elizabeth Bennet of &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;Fanny's nemesis and &quot;friend&quot; is the decidedly beautiful and  sophisitcated Ms. Crawford (who knows a great deal about &quot;Vices and  Rears&quot; -- she's speaking of the navy of course). Ms. Austen delighted  in giving her characters defects. In the book, Mary Crawford is good  natured but not principled, and Fanny is not good natured but she is very  principled. (Is beauty external or internal?) The differences between the  two women provide quite a bit of amusement and discomfort in the book, but  since the &quot;film&quot; Fanny is already beautiful some of the edge is  gone. In both the book and the film, Fanny is a better person than Mary, as  she proves by the end of the story.From my perspective, a major flaw of  this film is it's failure to develop Fanny's important relationships with  her Naval brother and sisters. Instead, the director INVENTED a subplot  about  slavery in the West Indies and connected it to Tom Bertram's illness  which seems to be the result of his witnessing a downright non-Austen scene  involving Mr. Bartram Sr. that could have been in &quot;The Wild Sargasso  Sea&quot; prequal to Jane Eyre.Although the book briefly alludes in the  preface to the basis for the Bertram's wealth, it never elaborates and  &quot;rubbing slavery in the faces of the audience&quot; misses what Ms.  Austen is about and why people still read her books. Ms. Austen did not  write about the political issues of the 18th-19th centuries. She wrote  about relationships. Given women had few choices, no civil rights, no  opportunities to do anything other than marry and have children or be a  spinster like Miss Norris, Ms Austen found plenty of &quot;social  conscience&quot; stuff to write about.I find it extremely irritating  that every time the topic of women's issues arises the discussion  invariably seems to turn to race and be trumped by it. Slavery was bad bad  bad thing that occurred to blacks AND WHITES (yes, there were white slaves  at this time), but Austen's books are about her observations in her own  life -- the disadvantage of and cruelty towards English men and women by  those who thought and still think they are better than others owing to  wealth and the priviliges associated with birth.Ms. Austen was aware of  social class distinctions and she uses her knowledge to make witty  observations about pretentious and immorality. (She wrote during the  Regency Period when the aristocracy left much to be desired.)The book  and movie use a device created by Shakespeare--the play within the play.  And Ms. Austin is making fun of this device. Whereas the play within the  play in Shakespere's Hamlet leads to discovery and resolution (Hamlet traps  his father's killer), Mansefield Park's play is a disaster that leads to  dissolution (Father traps children and puts them on probation).One of  the fun things to do with Austen's books is to look for opposites and  recurring characterizations.  For example, foolish women who risk all for a  bad bad man and foppish fools with money who have their suits of marriage  taken seriously.If you have read the book, you may be disappointed in  the film. I saw the film in the theater and I don't plan to buy the DVD.

What they don't get is: this movie IN ALL WAYS captures Jane Austen at her acerbic best.  Rozema has given Fanny all the pointed commentary that in the book is voiced by Austen, in her role as narrator, or by another character ( ""marriage is a maneuvering business"", voiced in the movie by Fanny, in the book by Mary Crawford).And Rozema has the religious background to depict Austen's attitudes towards adultery correctly:  AS A SIN.  AS AN EVIL. This is  made quite clear in the books last chapters, especially Edmund's description of his last interview with Mary Crawford.  Austen - and Edmund and  Fanny - do not share Mary Crawford's  more contemporary, modern attitude - that this may be folly, but it is not 'evil'.While the slavery issue is not as explicit in Austen, political events never are, but they always form a background.  The 'Militia' in P&P;, the 'Naval Officers' in Persuasion.Here we have slavery obliquely mentioned in the text, Antigua explicitly mentioned.  It was widely known that Antigua grew sugar cane with slave labor, exported refined sugar to England. Indeed, there was no other industry.  Her brother, Frank, in the Navy, visited Antigua and deplored the conditions of the slaves in 1806, her father George Austen acted as a trustee for an estate ( a sugar plantation) in Antigua ( he was deceased at the time the book was written in 1813), the first slave revolt in Santa Domingo was in 1801, and in 1807 the British Parliament made trading in slaves a FELONY for any British subject, anywhere in the world.While Rozema has expanded this storyline, it is inaccurate to whine that slavery is not mentioned in the text:  The only way you can get there is read the book with your eyes closed and in ignorance of a dozen years of crucial British history.Finally, the performances in this movie are stunning:  Francis O'Connor as Fanny!!Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas.

Those who profess to be experts about such things say that this early work  was not one of her best.  However, I found the film to be delightful and  very much in keeping with Austen's penchant for conjuring up romantic  intrigue in 19th century English society.This is the story of Fanny  Price (Frances O'Connor), who is taken out of poverty by her aunt and  benefactress to live in high society.  Though she is given every benefit  afforded her cousins, she is constantly reminded of her second-class status  in the household.  As the story revs up, we are treated to a typical Austen  maelstrom of misplaced romantic affections.  Mariah Bertram (Victoria  Hamilton) is engaged to Mr. Rushworth (Hugh Bonneville), but she is  infatuated with Henry Crawford (Allesandro Nivola) as is her sister Julia.  Though Henry enjoys flirting with Mariah, his true affections lie with  Fanny.  Fanny shuns his attentions because she loves her cousin Edmund  (Jonny Lee Miller) who is smitten by Henry's sister Mary (Embeth Davitz).  This is a classically delicious Austenian romantic conundrum.  The  remainder of the story goes about reconciling all the unrequited love with  more than a few interesting twists.Patricia Rozema adapted and directed  this film, which was very nicely done.  The choice of locations was  excellent and she used the countryside effectively, giving us numerous  lovely outdoor scenes.  The period rendering was very good as well,  presenting very realistic 19th century sets and costumes.  There has been a  lot of controversy about Rozema's insertion of the slave issue, which was  notably absent from Austen's novel.  To a point, I have to defend Rozema,  but ultimately I felt she went too far.A director has a responsibility  to make the film believable by providing details not in the script.  For  instance, Austen doesn't specifically describe the actual dress and  furniture of the time, so the director must find suitable props and  costumes of the period to give the film a genuine look and feel.  Slavery  was a dominant issue of the time and so the insertion of the topic was a  realistic detail, as long as it remained in the background.  However, the  introduction of the sketch pad (those who have seen the film will  understand) took slavery out of the background and made it a plot element.  This was tantamount to rewriting Austen's story, and I felt it was a  preachy and presumptuous abuse of artistic license.Frances O'Connor was  outstanding as Fanny.  She was enchanting and effervescent and passed  credibly for a teenager despite being almost 30 years old.  Fanny was a  multifaceted character.  She was a combination of youthful ebullience,  fierce independence and stubborn determination.  O'Connor handled all these  aspects of her character like a pro.  Embeth Davitz was also excellent as  Henry's conniving sister.This delightful and well-crafted film is very  entertaining and enjoyable.  I rated it 9/10.  With the possible exception  of the slavery issue, lovers of Jane Austen will not be disappointed.",5,Delightfully done,968803200,"09 13, 2000",2000,3203,"['am', 'great', 'fan', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'many', 'works', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'one', 'seeing', 'film', 'who', 'profess', 'be', 'experts', 'such', 'things', 'say', 'early', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'However', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'delightful', 'very', 'much', 'keeping', 'Austen', 'penchant', 'conjuring', 'up', 'romantic', 'intrigue', '19th', 'century', 'English', 'society.This', 'story', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'who', 'taken', 'poverty', 'aunt', 'benefactress', 'live', 'high', 'society', 'given', 'benefit', 'afforded', 'cousins', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'second-class', 'status', 'household', 'story', 'up', 'are', 'treated', 'typical', 'Austen', 'maelstrom', 'misplaced', 'romantic', 'affections', 'Mariah', 'Bertram', 'Victoria', 'Hamilton', 'engaged', 'Mr.', 'Rushworth', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'infatuated', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'Allesandro', 'Nivola', 'sister', 'Julia', 'Though', 'Henry', 'flirting', 'Mariah', 'true', 'affections', 'lie', 'Fanny', 'Fanny', 'attentions', 'cousin', 'Edmund', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'who', 'smitten', 'Henry', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Embeth', 'Davitz', 'classically', 'delicious', 'Austenian', 'romantic', 'conundrum', 'remainder', 'story', 'reconciling', 'unrequited', 'love', 'more', 'few', 'interesting', 'twists.Patricia', 'Rozema', 'adapted', 'directed', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'choice', 'locations', 'was', 'excellent', 'used', 'countryside', 'effectively', 'giving', 'numerous', 'lovely', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'period', 'rendering', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'presenting', 'very', 'realistic', '19th', 'century', 'sets', 'costumes', 'been', 'lot', 'controversy', 'Rozema', 'insertion', 'slave', 'issue', 'was', 'notably', 'absent', 'Austen', 'novel', 'point', 'have', 'defend', 'Rozema', 'ultimately', 'felt', 'went', 'too', 'far.A', 'director', 'responsibility', 'make', 'film', 'believable', 'providing', 'details', 'not', 'script', 'instance', 'Austen', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'describe', 'actual', 'dress', 'furniture', 'time', 'director', 'must', 'find', 'suitable', 'props', 'costumes', 'period', 'give', 'film', 'genuine', 'look', 'feel', 'Slavery', 'was', 'dominant', 'issue', 'time', 'so', 'insertion', 'topic', 'was', 'realistic', 'detail', 'as', 'long', 'remained', 'background', 'However', 'introduction', 'sketch', 'pad', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'understand', 'took', 'slavery', 'background', 'made', 'plot', 'element', 'was', 'tantamount', 'rewriting', 'Austen', 'story', 'felt', 'was', 'preachy', 'presumptuous', 'abuse', 'artistic', 'license.Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'was', 'outstanding', 'Fanny', 'was', 'enchanting', 'effervescent', 'passed', 'credibly', 'teenager', 'being', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'old', 'Fanny', 'was', 'multifaceted', 'character', 'was', 'combination', 'youthful', 'ebullience', 'fierce', 'independence', 'stubborn', 'determination', ""O'Connor"", 'handled', 'aspects', 'character', 'pro', 'Embeth', 'Davitz', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'Henry', 'conniving', 'sister.This', 'delightful', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'rated', '9/10', 'possible', 'exception', 'slavery', 'issue', 'lovers', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Mansfield Park VHS

If, however, you revel in period films done with good production values, intelligent writing and acting, and if you don't mind some nudity and shock value that moves the whole work out of the family-viewing arena, then this film has much to reccomend it.I mostly appreciated the way that this director/writer effort managed to transport elements of Austen's novel onto the screen, although they often appear tranformed as well as transported. Though this film lacks the polite-society feel of Austen as we have come to expect it from previous film versions of her novels, in purely literary terms it remains true to much of the themes and motives of the original. This version of Mansfield merely expresses them a bit differently.On the other hand, there are some aspects of this adaptation that stole the enjoyment for me. The infamous slave-drawings scene, for instance, while it helps sympathize Tom's character (you get why he's drowning his pain and moral confusion in alchohol), creates a huge dichotomy in my mind over Fanny's eventual reconciliation and respect for her uncle. How is it possible that such a thoughtful girl as Fanny can learn respect for the monstrous, evil-minded man her uncle is in this adaptation? In addition, that horrifying scene, with Fanny poring over the agonized drawings Tom made of his father engaging in acts of brutality with the family slaves, felt a bit too much like the director was expressing an agenda. I can deal with tough stuff in a movie, if it serves the story well, but this just didn't.Also, cousin Edmund lacks the motivations that in the novel, render his behavior understandable. Here, he comes off as a wispy stick-figure kind of guy. One has to wonder what her attraction to him could be. Their eventually coming together feels a bit too much like the characters themselves had access to the script and no choice but to follow it.For me, the main thing this movie lacked was any genuinely likeable characters other than Fanny, and perhaps her sister.

482061,A328S9RN3U5M68,6305892806,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","It has been thirteen years since this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel MANSFIELD PARK was made and while it may not be the most successful of the renderings of the Austen story it continues to entertain, primarily because of the rather top-notch cast.  Patricia Rozema adapted the novel for the screen an din addition to supplying the dialogue and sequencing she also directed - and that is where the gap between true Austen sensibility and interpretation seems to meander.The story is well known, but a capsule synopsis may help underline the attributes of this version. Young Fanny Price (Hannah Taylor- Gordon) is a poor relative who is sent to live with Sir Thomas Bertram (the now deceased Harold Pinter), the husband of her aunt. She is a typical Austen female - wise, clever, a fine writer - and bonds with Sir Thomas' youngest son Edmund (Philip Sarson). As the children move toward adulthood Fanny (now Frances O'Connor) gains beauty and is the ideal for a neighbor Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola). Sir Thomas promotes the match only to find that Fanny is a liberated woman with a mind of her own: Fanny, not wanting to be a passive girl, makes Henry prove himself a proper suitor. The mature Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) is taken with Henry's sister (Embeth Davis).  The concept of New World slavery enters as the characters discover that Sir Thomas is financially involved with that trade and Sir Thomas's son Tom (James Purefoy) is obsessed with the concept. Of course, twists and turns abound and characters' true selves are revealed and the ending is a typical `all's well that end's well' dynamic.The cast is large with some of the other roles well enacted by Victoria Hamilton, Hugh Bonneville, Justine Waddell, Shelia Gish, Amelia Warner and others. A fine cast, beautifully costumed, well photographed, but somehow it just doesn't seem like pure Jane Austen.

482065,A1R7TXCKWDZNOQ,6305892806,"Gwyn Gwyrdd ""geek""","[31, 37]","How absurd that modern filmmakers feel that the public could not possibly understand the classics without their help. Austen is the ONLY classic author whose entire collection is still in full circulation - an indication that generations later, the audience still &quot;gets it&quot;. Hollywood has endlessly held the notion that they have greater artistic and creative powers in their peabrains than the authors whose books have passed through millions of hands for decades.This version of Mansfield Park is, for the time, the most bloodstirring adaptation in existence - due to the contraversial retelling. In my opinion, the only consistencies are the names and bits and pieces of the storylines. Frances O'Connor gives an amazing performance considering the fact that she has nothing to work with - she is the gem and only point that makes the film worth watching. However, Fanny is no longer Fanny at all - the director has completely reinvented her. The most appalling sequence was the one in which Fanny accepts Henry's proposal. The chances of this happening in the novel are so absolutely impossible that I thought that this was some sort of dream sequence. In the novel, Fanny (whom the director actually shows getting smashed at a party given to her by the Bertrams - imagine Lizzie Bennet, Emma, or any of her other noble creatures portrayed in this manner) knows intuitively from the beginning that Henry shows enormous lack of character and NEVER for a moment considers accepting any of his attentions. The fact that she does so in the film is an enormous flaw and shows the director's complete misunderstanding of Austen's heroine.Also, the pivotal chapters in Mansfield surround the play and through it, our players true characters are revealed(Austen's own midsummer night if you will). Fanny is the innocent one - set apart during this whole section of the book by her wisdom and naivete. I was shocked when the film skimmed it for only a moment.The &quot;sketch book scene&quot; was, without a doubt, too great a liberty to take with the work of a classic author, as is the entire storyline that corresponded with it. I'm sure we all understand the vulgarity of slavery without needing to see it graphically displayed in a format that Austen herself would refuse to watch. Austen understood something the director of this film does not: subtlety.Finally, the most distressing scene to me was the moment after Henry and Mariah are discovered together. Rather than seeing our leading man and lady in a state of anger over what they've discovered, we see Fanny and Edmund aroused by the moment, grasping for each other and then ashamed by their own reaction. HELLLO! What is that?And for anyone that didn't catch the sexual innuendo in the scene where Mary is helping Fanny out of her wet clothes - I have to ask what planet they're from. There was no Edmund standing nearby to arouse in that scene. Oh, and I almost forgot, the director adds such a nice touch to the character of Fanny's father by making him a pervert as well - clutching at his daughters in a way that makes your stomach turn.Without a doubt, this film lacks Jane Austen's wit and wisdom. It disgusts me that it is considered some sort of tribute to her. Mansfield Park is considered by many to be Austen's greatest work - grand and subtle. Fanny's complex character is lost here, as well as everything that Austen was trying to say through her. This film has reduced this masterpiece to nothing more than the poor story of an unfortunate girl surrounded by perverts. But are we really shocked? Hollywood's idea to make anything better is - just add sex.

The first part of the movie is so depressing that you just want to turn it off and go on to something more digestible.  After she goes to Mansfield Park it gets a lot more interesting and seems to progress nicely from there. Although this Fanny may not be exactly what Jane Austen presented I like her very much. All the characters are attractive. Even the man that Fannie refuses after leading around by the nose for a while seems to not be such a bad fellow - just unable to resist temptation after being disappointed in love. Question?  If he had been accepted by Fannie and was married to her would his behavior have been any different - probably not. The unbelievable part is that Fanny goes back to her horrible home and seems very content there - impossible and unbelievable. She only goes back to Mansfield Park when summoned.  Question? Is the father(Edward's father) a lecher who longs to get his own hands on Fanny? He seems to be two absolutely different people - confusing but interesting. Is Miss Crawford entirely too helpful to Fanny removing her wet clothing? There are several twists and turns in the story that keep one interested. I recommend it as a ""movie"" not necessarily a good adaptation of the Jane Austen story. The most moving thing in the whole movie is when Fanny's mother says ""I married for love"" and leaves Fanny to realize how badly that turned out which may influence her own decision.

Some major plotpoints were taken, period costumes were added, and then the 20th century actresses with anorectic bodies, and smirky nasty attitudes were added, and we have a very nasty mess indeed.  Yes, I mean the same Frances O'Connor who was so blank as the dream/mother in A.I.  Clearly the Director's fault however, as he lets her raise eyebrows in sexual knowing and all but have a lesbian moment with almost twin co-star Embeth Davidz.  It is really apalling for any Austen fan.The entire focus on slavery is not mentioned at ALL in the book, and is misplaced in Austen.  There is only one mention of business in the islands, and that could have been many many  things.  It is indicative of the film author's and Director's desire to focus on the most venal and debased part of human nature.  That too, is not Austen.So... what rates 2 stars?  The production values are wonderful.  Costumes, sets, but especially the cinematography is a high mark.  The spinning, soaring visual breaks set the mental set of a young girl who is literally made dizzy by the world she is ""out of place"" in.  Unfortunately, it is not carried through in the choice of actress or direction.A brilliant, memorable and completely right casting choice is the double-casting of Lindsay Duncan as both sisters, Fanny's Aunt and mother, Lady Bertram and Mrs. Price.  This is modernized Austen, and therefore, not Austen at all.  It holds it own just barely... but if you are going to update the mental set of a piece, you really need to set it in modern day.  Boo Hiss.(If I may say, the herione of the slow but thorough BBC miniseries, Sylvestra Le Touzel, is badly treated by some.  She is halting and odd, somewhat irritating in her fish out of water -ness, but it is completely RIGHT for Fanny.  Fanny is one of Austen's least appealing heroines, but her purity of heart redeems her.)Update: 5/19/07 - I watched this again last night.  While I sill stand by what I said before, I should add that, taken completely on it's own, this film is entertaining and stands up well, and remains glorious to look at.  The performances are all very fine within the mental set mentioned above.  I'd also like to add that Victoria Hamilton gives a beautiful performance as troubled and bothersome Maria, and looks the most lovely she has ever looked.

This most recent film version of ""Mansfield Park"" has Frances O'Connor playing Fanny Price as we perhaps wished Austen had presented her.  She has some spirit; she's able to stand up for herself; she's much more her own person than she was portrayed in the BBC version.  The only problem is, this is not Austen's Fanny Price.  (Fanny was portrayed in the other extreme in the BBC version by Sylvestra LeTouzel; she was so whiny, holier-than-thou, judgemental and obnoxious in that film that we were left wondering what anyone could find attractive in this person.)Not only is O'Connor's characterization not Austen's Fanny Price, this movie is not Austen's ""Mansfield Park"".  Patricia Rozema took some appalling liberties with Austen's book; here we have Lady Bertram as an opium addict, which is supposed to explain her perpetual indolence; Sir Thomas is Simon Legree redux, and Edmund, who at least had some personality in the BBC version, albeit a moralizing, sanctimonious snob, is little more than a cypher in this film.  And Mary Crawford, depicted by Austen as a kind, generous, sympathetic character, is shown here as nothing more than a conniving little gold-digger.Austen tiptoed around the fact that the Bertram family's fortune came from the blood and toil of the slaves on the family's plantation in Antigua; Rozema shoves it right in the viewer's face with graphic images of Sir Thomas raping and abusing the hapless slaves.  Austen was well aware that the slave trade was an abomination, but she didn't go into it in her book, and it doesn't belong in any movie that purports to be based on the book.Taken on its own, the film is a fairly enjoyable period piece, and Frances O'Connor is a winning heroine; but no way in the world does this movie deserve the title of ""Mansfield Park"".Judy Lind",3,Will they EVER get this book right on film??,1038960000,"12 4, 2002",2002,1922,"['really', 'infuriating', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'most', 'profound', 'book', 'been', 'turned', 'two', 'very', 'frustrating', 'movies', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'version', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'playing', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'perhaps', 'wished', 'Austen', 'had', 'presented', 'spirit', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'herself', 'much', 'more', 'own', 'person', 'was', 'portrayed', 'BBC', 'version', 'only', 'problem', 'not', 'Austen', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'Fanny', 'was', 'portrayed', 'other', 'extreme', 'BBC', 'version', 'Sylvestra', 'LeTouzel', 'was', 'so', 'whiny', 'holier-than-thou', 'judgemental', 'obnoxious', 'film', 'were', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'anyone', 'could', 'find', 'attractive', 'person', 'Not', 'only', ""O'Connor"", 'characterization', 'not', 'Austen', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'movie', 'not', 'Austen', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Patricia', 'Rozema', 'took', 'appalling', 'liberties', 'Austen', 'book', 'here', 'have', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'opium', 'addict', 'supposed', 'explain', 'perpetual', 'indolence', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Simon', 'Legree', 'redux', 'Edmund', 'who', 'least', 'had', 'personality', 'BBC', 'version', 'moralizing', 'sanctimonious', 'snob', 'little', 'more', 'cypher', 'film', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'depicted', 'Austen', 'kind', 'generous', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'shown', 'here', 'nothing', 'more', 'conniving', 'little', 'gold-digger.Austen', 'tiptoed', 'fact', 'Bertram', 'family', 'fortune', 'came', 'blood', 'toil', 'slaves', 'family', 'plantation', 'Antigua', 'Rozema', 'right', 'viewer', 'face', 'graphic', 'images', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'raping', 'abusing', 'hapless', 'slaves', 'Austen', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'slave', 'trade', 'was', 'abomination', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'book', ""n't"", 'belong', 'movie', 'be', 'based', 'book.Taken', 'own', 'film', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'period', 'piece', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'winning', 'heroine', 'way', 'world', 'movie', 'title', 'Mansfield', 'Park', '.Judy', 'Lind']",Mansfield Park VHS

Perhaps they're trying to refine my boorish character. Actually, while I've not read any of the Austen novels (nor do I intend to), I've enjoyed all three screen versions. There's hope for me yet, even at this late date.This time around, our plucky heroine is Fannie Price, who, at the film's beginning at age 10, is sent by her parents from their flea-infested quayside hovel in Portsmouth to live with a pair of maternal aunts, Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan) and Mrs. Norris (Sheila Gish), at MANSFIELD PARK. Lady Bertram is married to the lord of the manor, Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter), and Mrs. Norris seems to be an integral part of Housekeeping. Fannie is to &quot;better herself&quot; among the family at the Great House, which includes Bertram's sons, Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) and Tom (James Purefoy) and daughters, Julia (Victoria Hamilton) and Maria (Justine Waddell). Very soon the script jumps forward several years to 1806, and Fannie is now a young woman (played by Frances O'Conner). By this time also, Maria is engaged to a dull but congenial local chap, Mr. Rushworth (Hugh Bonneville).Fannie is pretty much unimpressed by her residence among the landed gentry, and her wit, which she sometimes addresses to the camera (a nice touch to the film), is sharp. As she says of living at MANSFIELD PARK, &quot;Life seems nothing more than a quick succession of busy nothings.&quot; One day, these &quot;busy nothings&quot; turn steamier with the arrival of the Crawfords, a brother/sister act, Henry (Alessandro Nivola) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz), who are there to rent out a nearby cottage. The film's best scene is perhaps when the Crawfords are ushered into the parlor where Fannie and the Bertrams are gathered while Sir Thomas and Tom, Jr. are off on a jolly inspecting the family's plantation in Antigua. One could hear a pin drop as the lens focuses on the faces of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, Julia and Maria as their eyes fasten on the Gorgeous Hunk Henry, and on Mary's as she scrutinizes young Edmund. The look each demonstrates is the same I might show when stumbling across an especially fine piece of steak at the meat counter. Very soon, emotions run high. Maria has the hots for Henry, but he's obsessed with Fannie, who continues in her long standing love of Edmund, who may or may not return the feeling but is momentarily distracted by the admiring flirtations of the alluring Mary. It's the usual Austen Regency soap opera with its attendant crises d'amour.For me, the considerable appeal of MANSFIELD PARK lies somewhere between that of P&amp;P and S&amp;S, the former having the highest (because of a greater length that allowed for varied and fuller character development). The vulnerable yet strong-willed Price is wonderfully likable, especially when she (both as the 10-year old and the young adult) delivers her asides to the viewing audience with wry humor and a mischievous smile. And, unlike the other two Austen epics mentioned, MANSFIELD PARK has a truly sharp edge revolving around the enslaved Blacks on the Bertrams' Antiguan property. Fannie is cut by this one day when she discovers some eye-opening sketches made by the younger Tom of events back on the plantation. No scene of such intensity was ever part of the cinematic P&amp;P or S&amp;S, and it's startling because it's so unexpected. It's an effective counterpoint to the gentility of Fannie's present environment.If I have it right, there are one or two more Austen novels on film, plus at least one by Charlotte Bront, that I'm being pressured to view.

Unfortunately it is not as beautiful of a period piece as I have come to expect since nowadays there are so many exquisite productions to compare it to. The references to the social situation and slavery are very well integrated and I think it's about time someone allowed this aspect to come out of these stories, since Jane Austen does give--albeit hidden--allusions to these issues in the parlor conversation. On the other hand, the excuses given to the oldest son of a spoiled aristocratic family are a bit much. In her books, Jane Austen doesn't judge her characters as much as the screenwriters appear to. In addition, I could not give it 5 stars because I don't completely believe in the actors -- that they really understand the period or even their parts.

482091,ASLTUNWNRTUOY,6305892806,J. Walsh,"[7, 15]","I was enormously entertained by the film. Fanny Price as depicted here is a fine woman, a female hero. She is not as assertive as she might be, it is true, but a realistic look at her background helps to account for this. She does, however, show the courage of her convictions by never stooping to the moral and intellectual levels of those around her, even when expedience demands it of her. She is a thinking individual; I'm convinced the author identified with her in many ways.This film, in spite of what the previous reviewer wrote (Bea Bea must be great fun at a party) is not racy. It stays within the boundary of excellent taste throughout, and it is a tribute to the director and producer that they found a way to utilize the period homes of England to such great advantage-an intellectual and visual feast it is.Finally, Frances O'Connor is terrific as Fanny. Her depiction of the integrity-driven Ms Price colored by a diffidence easily excused by her poverty tinted background is absolutely convincing.

482092,AFRZL05D54MPM,6305892806,JWolf,"[1, 2]","OVERVIEW:  Loosely based on Jane Austen's novel, ""Mansfield Park,"" the 1999 film of the same name is a dramatic romantic-comedy directed and co-written by Patricia Rozema.  Despite the movie's considerable deviations from Austen's novel, it debuted with mostly favorable reception; ""Mansfield Park"" holds ratings of 76% and 71% from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, respectively.  As a fan of Jane Austen novels and their on-screen adaptations, I can say that I was initially disappointed to learn of the liberties taken by this screenplay; however, once I considered the number of films adapted from the original ""Mansfield Park"" novel, I began to appreciate the necessity of Rozema's plot and character changes.  Taken as a film and separate from the novel, I believe this is a fantastically written and acted screenplay--in this sense, I feel Rozema has successfully embodied the wit and emotional torment that underlies Austen's original plot, and far better so than is seen with other film versions of this novel--which may, after all, be the best way to pay homage to the influential writing of the great Jane Austen.SPECIAL FEATURES:  (1-disc / PG-13 / Released 7-11-00 / 112 min. run-time)  includes Audio Commentary and Making Of ""Mansfield Park.""DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOOK AND FILM:  An entertaining and intelligent film all-its-own, I think it's fair to note a few of the differences between ""Mansfield Park"" `the novel' and `the 1999 film' for prospective viewers.  The first variation occurs with the prominence of slavery as a theme; the issue, lightly touched upon in the book, gains a central role in the film.  Throughout the movie, Fanny's status as a poor female is compared to that of a slave, yet contrast occurs between their respective treatments.  Secondly, the film version incorporates events from the life of the real Jane Austen (in lieu of those about which she wrote), exemplified by the film's portrayal of Fanny's initial acceptance to Henry's proposal, which she later recants.  In addition, Fanny Price's character undergoes several fundamental changes, most noticeably that she is written as a much stronger person in the film version.  Most of the lesser variations can be summarized as changes to characters, timelines, and plot focus.STARRING ROLES include:  Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price/Bertram, Alessandro Nevola as Henry Crawford, Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas Bertram, Lindsay Duncan as Lady Bertram/Mrs. Price, James Purefoy as Tom Bertram, Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Rushworth, Jonny Lee Miller as Edmund Bertram, Victoria Hamilton as Maria Bertram, Embeth Davidtz as Mary Crawford, Justine Waddell as Julia Bertram, Sophia Myles as Susan Price, Sheila Gish as Mrs. Norris, Hilton McRae as Mr. Price, Anna Popplewell as Betsey, and Hannah Taylor-Gordon as young Fanny Price.SUMMARY:  Mrs. Price (sister of Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris) married Mr. Price for love, not money.  The Price family's financial struggles are eased when their 10-year-old daughter, Fanny, is sent to live with her mother's wealthy relatives, the Bertrams, at Mansfield Park.  Aside from Edmund Bertram, one of her cousins, Fanny is treated more like a household servant than a family member.  Knowing she cannot return home to her own family, Fanny feels trapped, which often elicits comparison between Fanny and the numerous Bertram slaves to whom the family owes its wealth.Eight years later, the issue of slavery comes under fire.  Fear the financial toll that abolition poses for the Bertram family, Sir Thomas and his son, Tom, make a trip to Antigua to see a stop to any rebellions.  During their absence, the young and worldly siblings, Henry and Mary Crawford, pay a visit to Mansfield Park.  Even though she is engaged to Mr. Rushworth, Maria salaciously competes with her sister, Julie, for Henry's attention; because Edmund focuses his attention on Mary, Fanny feels unwanted.Upon his return to Mansfield Park, Tom is accompanied by a friend, Mr. Yates; together, the two young men insist on conducting a reenactment of the play ""Lovers' Vows,"" a welcomed excuse for the Bertrams and Crawfords to flirt with one another.  Just as Maria `pretends' to seduce Henry, Sir Thomas returns home and quickly puts a stop to the play.  Shortly thereafter, Maria weds Mr. Rushworth; she and Julia move to Brighton.  Henry, now bored at the loss of Maria's attention, sets his sights on Fanny (who does not return his favor).  Much to his surprise, Henry develops deep feelings for Fanny, leading to his request for Fanny's hand in marriage.  Repulsed by Henry's previous treatment of the Bertram girls, Fanny refuses the proposal.  Angered by the rejection of what he deems to be a ""generous"" offer, Sir Thomas sends Fanny back to live with the Price family.Soon after Fanny's return home, Henry pays a visit to the Price family in hopes that he might convince Fanny to reconsider his proposal.  When Fanny receives a letter from Edmund, notifying her of his intentions with Mary, Fanny becomes open to ""settling"" for Henry--she quickly regains her senses and, once again, denies his offer.Meanwhile, at Mansfield Park, Tom has fallen ill and requires Fanny's tender caretaking.  Edmond retrieves Fanny; on their way back to the Bertram home, tension between the two exposes their mutual feelings for one another.  Julia and the now-married Maria Rushworth return shortly thereafter.  When Fanny and Edmund discover Maria and Henry's affair, the two grow even closer, almost tempting Edmund to forsake his affections for Mary.  Once news of the adultery breaks, Mary attempts to patch the shame by suggesting Maria and Henry wed.  Fanny questions how the Crawfords can afford two weddings, leading Mary to give a cold-hearted response concerning the fortune Edmund will inherit upon Tom's death.  Edmund is disgusted by Mary's true intentions and denounces his attachment to Mary.... [The film ends with all loose ends tied up into a neat little bow].",3,'Austen-ism'...

There was too much profanity, too much sexuality, and definitely too much brutality to slaves as depicted in supposed drawings by Tom while he visited the West Indies.There was no hint that audiences were about to view explicit sexually violent drawings of the slaves, and my 83 year old mother had never seen anything like it.

We review FILMS here at Amazon...not the book from which the film came! As a film, Patricia Rozema's adaptation of Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK stands on it's own as a stinging, satirical view of the life and times of one Fanny Price in 1806 England. All that is Austen,the ""advantageous alliances"" that are made through marriage, scandals that could kill a family's reputation, the pecking order of sons for inheritance, and the heart as the moral compass and guide are all here, and brought to the screen with great effect infused with a little bit of naughtiness and innuendo. This retelling of MANSFIELD PARK is so interesting and wonderfully reconceived that it far outweighs the BBC version for it's fresh and new characterizations of Fanny and the Bertrams and the Crawfords.What I really like about this MANSFIELD PARK is Rozema's clever weaving of the English Slave Trade into the fiber of the film. No doubt this WAS THE hot topic of the time as in 1807 the trade of the Middle Passage WAS abolished in England.(See the current film AMAZING GRACE)Yes,people who sought their fortunes in it DID turn ""to tobacco"",which was the trade simply continued in America!!!As far as performances...they are OUTSTANDING. Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas was played with great complexity and the late Sheila Gish as Fanny's Aunt is one of the best comedic turns yet for an Austen adaptation!Lesley Barber's soundtrack is lush, romantic and also full of witty motifs to propel the action.This MANSFIELD PARK is full of fine direction, sets, costumes and modern sensibility that makes the timeless Austen all the more compelling.The film never lags and is quite clever. 5******'s for Rozema's Austen!",5,I have not read the book....AND I AM GLAD!!!,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,1781,"['Excellent..superb..well', 'acted..well', 'scripted..dark', 'brooding', 'could', 'go', 'review', 'FILMS', 'here', 'Amazon', 'not', 'book', 'film', 'came', 'film', 'Patricia', 'Rozema', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'own', 'stinging', 'satirical', 'view', 'life', 'times', 'one', 'Fanny', 'Price', '1806', 'England', 'Austen', 'advantageous', 'alliances', 'are', 'made', 'marriage', 'scandals', 'could', 'kill', 'family', 'reputation', 'pecking', 'order', 'sons', 'inheritance', 'heart', 'moral', 'compass', 'guide', 'are', 'here', 'brought', 'screen', 'great', 'effect', 'infused', 'little', 'bit', 'naughtiness', 'innuendo', 'retelling', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'so', 'interesting', 'wonderfully', 'reconceived', 'far', 'BBC', 'version', 'fresh', 'new', 'characterizations', 'Fanny', 'Bertrams', 'Crawfords.What', 'really', 'like', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'Rozema', 'clever', 'weaving', 'English', 'Slave', 'Trade', 'fiber', 'film', 'doubt', 'hot', 'topic', 'time', '1807', 'trade', 'Middle', 'Passage', 'WAS', 'abolished', 'England', 'See', 'current', 'film', 'AMAZING', 'GRACE', 'Yes', 'people', 'who', 'sought', 'fortunes', 'DID', 'turn', 'tobacco', 'was', 'trade', 'simply', 'continued', 'America', 'As', 'far', 'performances', 'are', 'OUTSTANDING', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'was', 'played', 'great', 'complexity', 'late', 'Sheila', 'Gish', 'Fanny', 'Aunt', 'one', 'best', 'comedic', 'yet', 'Austen', 'adaptation', 'Lesley', 'Barber', 'soundtrack', 'lush', 'romantic', 'also', 'full', 'witty', 'motifs', 'propel', 'action.This', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'full', 'fine', 'direction', 'sets', 'costumes', 'modern', 'sensibility', 'timeless', 'Austen', 'more', 'compelling.The', 'film', 'never', 'lags', 'quite', 'clever', '5******', 'Rozema', 'Austen']",Mansfield Park VHS

Undoubtedly, one of Austen's favorite messages is that money matters less than love when it comes to marriage.

482112,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305892806,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 18]","""Mansfield Park"" might have been part of the wave of adaptations of Jane Austen novels that made the long dead British novelist one of the hottest writers in Hollywood for a couple of years, but this is a different sort of Jane Austen, perhaps best represented by the brief nudity of a pivotal scene.  Of course, writer-director Patricia Rozema makes no claims to be providing a faithful version of the novel, choosing instead to offer a credit that declares the film to be based on the novel along with passages from Austen's journals, letters, and early writings.  Consequently, ""Mansfield Park"" is transformed from a novel centered on a most serious debate about religion and religious duty into a concerted attack upon the British upper class, laid out against the central character's prospects for finding a husband.The central character in question is Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a self-effacing young woman with flashing eyes and strong opinions, which she might put down on paper but would never say out loud.  As a young girl Fanny is sent by her mother from the family's squalid city hovel to live with the Bertrams, rich cousins living in the country at the titular manor.  Fanny has formed a strong bond of friendship with the youngest Bertram son, Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller), but is being urged to marry the young rake, Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola), by Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter).  Separated from her beloved sister (there is always a beloved sister for an Austen heroine), save for their letters, Fanny becomes friends with Henry's sister Mary (Embeth Davidtz), who has her own eye on Edmund.  Consequently ""Mansfield Park"" offers the standard sort of mismatched affection that is always at the heart of an Austen novel.The director commentary by Rozema was most insightful because time and time again she claimed that scenes I considered suspect were taken from the novel.  There is a decidedly modern sensibility to the way relationships are portrayed in this film.  At various times we become convinced that Sir Thomas and Mary are both interested in Fanny in a sexual way.  Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan) is constantly taking laudanum, the oldest son is a drunken sot, and the family fortune is earned by slave labor in Antigua.  Most importantly, there is sex in this film, not just the prospect of romance.Of course, the chief enjoyment of any Austen film is in rooting on our heroine, and O'Connor shines as Fanny.  We suffer as we watch the facade she puts on in public, knowing we have seen the real Fanny when she reads to us what she has written, and we wait patiently for the man she loves to come to the inevitable conclusion that the intelligent and moral Fanny is the only woman at Mansfield Park worth taking as a wife.  Pinter's performance as Lord Bertram is perfectly marvelous and Davidtz as the cold blooded Mary, whose solution to the climatic family crisis makes it abundantly clear she is the antithesis of Fanny, provides the other standout acting job in the film.In the final analysis, I am content with the inventions Rozema has brought to Austen's novel.  After all, these novels are no more sacred texts than the writings of any other great author that has been given the Hollywood treatment.

The integration of young Austen's early novels (juvenile efforts that were never published in her life time) fits perfectly into the film's narrative.

But &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is not without its own persuasions, and so I found it enjoyable.Now, I must admit it has been far too many years since I read the novel to be able to determine how far it may stray from the original. To be sure, I do remember that there is an episode of adulterous behavior in the book, which is usually NOT what goes on in Austen! Austen typically is concerned with whether young ladies are being &quot;cut&quot; or not; that is, whether they are being snubbed by their social superiors. The slave trade aspect seems a little unlikely, though I'd have to re-read to state so more emphatically.I will tell you that the single biggest surprise, and the part I personally enjoyed most, was the portrayal of Sir Thomas Bertram by the playwright Harold Pinter. What a masterful performance! He sweeps aside the other male characters and has incredible animal magnetism. I was quite disappointed that Pinter was not even nominated for an Oscar for this role; as far as I was concerned, he walked away with the picture.That's not to say, though, that the other actors were not good. i thought that the double role of Aunt Lady Bertram/Mrs. Price was done very well, and that serpentine portrayal of Mary Campbell was ingeniously served--she reminded me very much of Kiri te Kanawa. I could have fallen in love myself with the fellow playing Henry Campbell, and I think I would have chosen him without having to go off to a sea-side pigsty to think it over, like our heroine.Perhaps a bit heavy on the suggestion of lesbianism, however, which is also not very Austen-like either and not needed to create interest.On the whole, an enjoyable film outside the usual Austen treatment.",4,Another Jane Austen Success Story,1002758400,"10 11, 2001",2001,1882,"['Yes', 'did', 'like', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'favorite', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'last', 'six', 'years', 'so', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'not', 'own', 'persuasions', 'so', 'found', 'must', 'admit', 'been', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'read', 'novel', 'be', 'able', 'determine', 'how', 'far', 'may', 'stray', 'original', 'be', 'sure', 'do', 'remember', 'episode', 'adulterous', 'behavior', 'book', 'usually', 'NOT', 'what', 'Austen', 'Austen', 'typically', 'concerned', 'young', 'ladies', 'are', 'being', 'quot', 'cut', 'quot', 'not', 'are', 'being', 'snubbed', 'social', 'superiors', 'slave', 'trade', 'aspect', 'little', 'unlikely', ""'d"", 'have', 're-read', 'state', 'so', 'more', 'emphatically.I', 'will', 'tell', 'single', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'part', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'portrayal', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Bertram', 'playwright', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'What', 'masterful', 'performance', 'aside', 'other', 'male', 'characters', 'incredible', 'animal', 'magnetism', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'Pinter', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'walked', 'away', 'picture.That', 'not', 'say', 'though', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'i', 'thought', 'double', 'role', 'Aunt', 'Lady', 'Bertram/Mrs', 'Price', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'serpentine', 'portrayal', 'Mary', 'Campbell', 'was', 'ingeniously', 'served', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'Kiri', 'te', 'Kanawa', 'could', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'fellow', 'playing', 'Henry', 'Campbell', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'having', 'go', 'off', 'sea-side', 'pigsty', 'think', 'over', 'heroine.Perhaps', 'bit', 'heavy', 'suggestion', 'lesbianism', 'however', 'also', 'not', 'very', 'Austen-like', 'not', 'needed', 'create', 'interest.On', 'whole', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'usual', 'Austen', 'treatment']",Mansfield Park VHS

She loves to read and write and her intelligence and wit shine through.There is also soapbox drama when con-artists arrive to the estate.  Mary and Henry Crawford want to establish ties with the the Bertram's through marriages so they can inherit some of the fortune and estate.  Henry proposed to Fanny, she would not take up his offer.

I believe that Rozema's point was to take Jane Austen's life and intermix it with the one novel that was close to her actual experiences. Yes, it does stray fromt the original novel, but I don not see why that has to be a bad thing.As for the slavery and adultery issues, some reviewers are talking as if it never happened back then. It did. Jane Austen just couldn't write about it as explicitly. I think it adds credibility to the times the story is told in, not leading people to believe that everything was light-hearted and romantic. These people did earn their living from slavery and Ms. Rozema did an admirable and brave thing to bring that up. No, it isn't resolved at the end completely, but then slavery wasn't abolished until after the time period of the movie, so it's not that big of a deal.Bottom Line: the movie was well done. Frances O'Connor, Jonny Lee Miller, and the rest of the cast do an outstanding job. The movie should be taken as being &quot;inspired&quot; by Jane Austen's &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, not as a page by page copy.

482133,A533YH6B9JNFQ,6305892806,Maria Aragon,"[4, 12]","Mansfield Park is the least favorite of Jane Austen's novels for me.  I always got the feeling that she was warring with her own impulses and instincts to come up with its proper, rather formal ending.  It feels like an ugly duckling growing phase in her oeuvre, so now we come to this film of the book.  Evidently they had the same problems so many of us did with Fanny Price's 'passivity ', so they tried to make her into a more shrewdly observant commentator like her creator was, which was an interesting approach.  ( I had seen the BBC version by the way in which Fanny seemed like the little shocked mouse radiating potent disapproval on an entire household, psychically manipulating others or trying to in the name of prudent conduct.)  By making Fanny more like Jane, they tried to make her more approachable, admirable, but a little of the subtleties of the family's interactions was lost - due to time demands in that format, which were inescapable in the novel and BBC version.  I did not mind that approach, except that it made it even more excruciating when Henry Crawford ( Alessandro Nivola ) turns up, flirts shamelessly with the Bertram sisters, only to recognize something better or more compelling about Fanny Price and to court her instead.  Mr. Nivola really brings that charming scoundrel to life, so much so that it is torture to watch Fanny accept and then reject him.  You sympathize more for him and you suddenly see why he would act out the way he does after Fanny's treatment of him.  In this casting, the performance itself on Mr. Nivola's part, and the choices of the filmmaker, this film shines a harsh light on what seemed like an unsatisfactory choice that Jane Austen made.  The original ending seems like a clinical imposition and the film reminds one of the road not taken.  The character of Edmund was wonderfully cast too, but still, and no one seems to have brought this up even in the book reviews, Edmund and Fanny are FIRST COUSINS.  I mean...EWWW!  (It makes one wish for a time machine, so one could go back and have a little chat about genetics and social taboos with Jane Austen.)  If you loved the novel as it was, then you won't like this movie.  If you found Henry Crawford beguiling in the novel, this movie will be a wonderful torment, until it becomes frustrating when Jane Austen's plot goes it's inevitable way.",4,Reinterpretation that grapples with conceived flaws,1055289600,"06 11, 2003",2003,2365,"['Mansfield', 'Park', 'least', 'favorite', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'always', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'warring', 'own', 'impulses', 'instincts', 'come', 'up', 'proper', 'rather', 'formal', 'ending', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'growing', 'phase', 'oeuvre', 'so', 'now', 'come', 'film', 'book', 'Evidently', 'had', 'same', 'problems', 'so', 'many', 'did', 'Fanny', 'Price', ""'passivity"", 'tried', 'make', 'more', 'shrewdly', 'observant', 'commentator', 'creator', 'was', 'was', 'interesting', 'approach', 'had', 'seen', 'BBC', 'version', 'way', 'Fanny', 'seemed', 'little', 'shocked', 'mouse', 'radiating', 'potent', 'disapproval', 'entire', 'household', 'psychically', 'manipulating', 'others', 'trying', 'name', 'prudent', 'conduct', 'making', 'Fanny', 'more', 'Jane', 'tried', 'make', 'more', 'approachable', 'admirable', 'little', 'subtleties', 'family', 'interactions', 'was', 'lost', 'due', 'time', 'demands', 'format', 'were', 'inescapable', 'novel', 'BBC', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'approach', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'excruciating', 'when', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'up', 'flirts', 'shamelessly', 'Bertram', 'sisters', 'only', 'recognize', 'something', 'better', 'more', 'compelling', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'court', 'instead', 'Mr.', 'Nivola', 'really', 'charming', 'scoundrel', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'torture', 'watch', 'Fanny', 'accept', 'then', 'reject', 'sympathize', 'more', 'suddenly', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'act', 'out', 'way', 'Fanny', 'treatment', 'casting', 'performance', 'Mr.', 'Nivola', 'part', 'choices', 'filmmaker', 'film', 'harsh', 'light', 'what', 'seemed', 'unsatisfactory', 'choice', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'made', 'original', 'ending', 'clinical', 'imposition', 'film', 'one', 'road', 'not', 'taken', 'character', 'Edmund', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'too', 'still', 'one', 'have', 'brought', 'up', 'even', 'book', 'Edmund', 'Fanny', 'are', 'FIRST', 'COUSINS', 'mean', 'EWWW', 'one', 'wish', 'time', 'machine', 'one', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'have', 'little', 'chat', 'genetics', 'social', 'taboos', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'loved', 'novel', 'was', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'found', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'beguiling', 'novel', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'wonderful', 'torment', 'frustrating', 'when', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'plot', 'inevitable', 'way']",Mansfield Park VHS

'Mansfield Park' may be the most difficult of Austen's novels to adapt, but Rozema did not adapt it so much as hijack it as a pro-feminist, anti-slavery rant in Regency costume. Rozema indeed deviates by making deviates of several characters: Sir Thomas is a sadistic bully who verbally abuses Fanny and rapes his slaves, Lady Bertram is an opium addict,  and Mary Crawford borders on being a sexual predator who has no moral compass. Rozema's 'Fanny Price' is exactly the opposite of Austen's 'Fanny', and not in any way that improves upon JA's. Rozema's 'Fanny' is arrogant, smug,condescending, judgmental and more than a little conniving. Many have said JA's 'Fanny' is her most difficult character to like; I found Rozema's impossible to like. Hardest to stomach after the politicization is Fanny's contempt for her birth family during her enforced 'visit' to Portmouth. She looks down her nose at their struggle and poverty, and exudes an air of ""I'm just soooo above all this.""Why watch it at all? The cinematography is lush and the costuming lovely. I watch this Henry Crawford and could believe he might just really love Fanny, not this Fanny but JA's Fanny.  Jonny Lee Miller's 'Edmund' is my favorite among 'Mansfield' adaptations, and in Frances Price (Fanny's mother) you see the beautiful woman who married for love and now regrets that childish decision. Unfortunately none of that helps 'Mansfield' rise above it's shortcomings as an adaptation.As a period piece 'Mansfield Park' has a certain attraction, and can stand on its own rather well.

On the other hand, Mansfield Park is not generally reckoned among Austen's best work, and in my opinion it benefits rather a lot from the extra dimensions, the darker undercurrents and the sheer zest added by the movie-script. As does the character of Fanny Price, who is transformed from the rather insipid victim and distant witness she is in the book, into a personality every bit as strong and outspoken as Elizabeth Bennet, making her the pivotal force in the drama. Her character is fleshed out further by turning her partly into Jane Austen herself: the delightfully whimsical correspondence with her sister in Portsmouth is all Austen's own. Thus reinforced, Fanny is well equipped to handle some very un-Austenlike situations; still, her walking in on Maria and Crawford ""in flagrante delicto"" may well give the authenticists a start. Henry Crawford is a rather more good-looking and charming character in the film than the book would have you expect (where Austen merely describes him as ""not handsome"", but in possession of ""an air and countenance""), which makes Fanny's doubts and vacillations more readily understandable. The slave-trade issue, only touched upon lightly in the book, is taken to the forefront of the story, culminating in Fanny's discovery of Tom Bertram's sketchbook, containing graphic depictions of the horrors going on at his father's Antiguan estate - throwing a very sinister light on Sir Thomas in the process.Inevitably, the additions to the story, the profiling of the main protagonists, and the retelling of 350+ pages in just over 100 minutes, mean that other characters are reduced to vignettes, or completely left out. I did not find this at all disturbing - in fact the caricaturist treatment of Mrs. Norris or Lady Bertram adds a lot of the required ""comic relief"".  Also, there are some hilarious tongue-in-cheek moments, as when, at the beginning of her fatal speech on the possible rehabilitation of Maria and Henry, Mary Crawford exclaims, ""For heaven's sake, this is 1806!"" Again, purists may object against this scene: in the book Mary entrusts her scheme only to Edmund, and Fanny hears it from him second-hand; but in the film Mary shares it with the entire Bertram family including Fanny, and with the added cynicism of speculating openly on the financial benefits to be had from Tom's probable death. It is then not Edmund, but Fanny who challenges her. It is a very liberal solution, but dramatically it works perfectly, providing an intense climax through a head-on clash of ""good""  and ""evil"".The cast is as good as that in any of the other high-quality Austen films we have had in recent years, but Frances O'Connor deserves to be singled out; she has tremendous charm and charisma, and is a presence powerful enough to carry the entire movie on her own. Jonny Lee-Miller, whom you might well associate with a rather different type of work, is a very convincing Edmund, and Harold Pinter gives us a suitably troubled and complex Thomas Bertram.The entire film exudes an unsentimental, even cool atmosphere; in terms of cinematography, the eye can feast on many gorgeous images, at times Vermeer-like in their stark beauty. The choice to ""cast"" the fantastic ruins of Kirby Hall as Mansfield Park is a masterstroke, making it clear right from the start that all is not well with the Bertrams (why a completely different house is shown on the box cover is beyond me...).

However, I have to warn you that there are some things that I was surprised were in a PG movie.  I believe I saw a nudity for a brief moment.  I'm not sure about that because I didn't feel like rewinding it to make sure.  And there are also drawings of the brutal things that were happening to the slaves, including a woman being raped.  If you love the book and are looking for a good representation of it, I'm sorry to tell you that I don't think it exists.  I've seen 3 versions: this one starring Frances O'Connor, the version starring Billie Piper, and the awful 1986 adaptation.  In this version, lots of things are different from the book, most notably, the character of Fanny Price.  In the book she's quiet, but firm and virtuous.  I have to admit that this was never my favorite of Jane Austen's characters.  So while I actually liked the witty, active character that Frances O'Connor played in this version better than the true Fanny Price, it still bugs me that the movie strays so far from the book.  The version starring Billie Piper left out such large chunks from the book that events in that movie don't even make sense.  And the 1986 version stars the worst actress I've ever had the misfortune of seeing on the screen.

Actually, the film Fanny Price is much more likeable than Austen's character, who never could have carried a movie on her own, being too pious and self-effacing, and in my opinion, downright dull. &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is obviously not my favorite Austen! However, the book deserved better than the socio-political tract that the director was determined to make it into, with historcially inaccurate references to slavery, and a hint of lesbianism. The book was set at a time in British history where the slave trade had been outlawed for several years, and so it would have been impossible for Fanny to have seen a slave ship discharging slaves off of the coast of England. There was nothing in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, the book, to suggest in any way that Mary Crawford was bisexual, although I can accept a defense that the director was trying to portray her as an amoral woman who would try to seduce anyone just to see if she could do it.To my way of thinking, the best part of the movie came when Fanny was ordered to return to her birth family by her uncle (a deliciously creepy turn by Harold Pinter). After living in the comparative luxury of Mansfield Park since she was a young girl, O'Connor's Fanny is repulsed by the squalid conditions she finds at her old home. Her father (who seems to take a more than slightly unfatherly interest in his lovely daughter)is a drunkard, and her mother is harried and slovenly. It was a stroke of brillance on the part of the director to have the same actress portray Fanny's mother and aunt, who were, after all, sisters.Even though the movie is not Jane Austen, and the politics of the director are hardly subtle, I still think the movie is worth viewing, primarily for the performances of O'Connor and Pinter. I think if you just try to forget that it is an adaptation of a classic work of English literature you will find the movie to be much more enjoyable.",3,Not Jane Austen's Fanny Price,1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2003,2028,"['Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'Fanny', 'Price', 'not', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'delighful', 'girl', 'none', 'less', 'Actually', 'film', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'much', 'more', 'likeable', 'Austen', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'movie', 'own', 'being', 'too', 'pious', 'self-effacing', 'opinion', 'downright', 'dull', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'obviously', 'not', 'favorite', 'Austen', 'However', 'book', 'deserved', 'better', 'socio-political', 'tract', 'director', 'was', 'determined', 'make', 'historcially', 'inaccurate', 'references', 'slavery', 'hint', 'lesbianism', 'book', 'was', 'set', 'time', 'British', 'history', 'where', 'slave', 'trade', 'had', 'been', 'outlawed', 'several', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'Fanny', 'have', 'seen', 'slave', 'ship', 'discharging', 'slaves', 'coast', 'England', 'was', 'nothing', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'book', 'suggest', 'way', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'was', 'bisexual', 'can', 'accept', 'defense', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'portray', 'amoral', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'try', 'seduce', 'anyone', 'just', 'see', 'could', 'do', 'it.To', 'way', 'thinking', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'came', 'when', 'Fanny', 'was', 'ordered', 'return', 'birth', 'family', 'uncle', 'deliciously', 'creepy', 'turn', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'living', 'comparative', 'luxury', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'was', 'young', 'girl', ""O'Connor"", 'Fanny', 'repulsed', 'squalid', 'conditions', 'old', 'home', 'father', 'who', 'take', 'more', 'slightly', 'unfatherly', 'interest', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'drunkard', 'mother', 'harried', 'slovenly', 'was', 'stroke', 'brillance', 'part', 'director', 'have', 'same', 'actress', 'portray', 'Fanny', 'mother', 'aunt', 'who', 'were', 'sisters.Even', 'movie', 'not', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'politics', 'director', 'are', 'hardly', 'subtle', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'worth', 'viewing', 'primarily', 'performances', ""O'Connor"", 'Pinter', 'think', 'just', 'try', 'forget', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'work', 'English', 'literature', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable']",Mansfield Park VHS

I saw nothing about it that made me think it was catering to 1999's sensibilities, despite the use of a scene where someone is caught in flagrante with another. Aside from that indiscretion, the dialog seemed like authentic Austen to me and the whole affair has been expertly photographed in England, of course, on lush locales that are breathtakingly gorgeous to look at. The swirling camera swerves often from the interior of a room to the vast horizons outside with the greatest of ease.And, of course, the British cast cannot be praised highly enough. All of them perform to the manor born in the appropriate style. FRANCES O'CONNOR (who closely resembles a young Jennifer Jones) is Fanny Price, the poor girl sent to live with rich relatives at Mansfield Park, who becomes an elegant young woman and a writer. (Sounds suspiciously like the author herself inserting her character on this role).And JONNY LEE MILLER is Edmund Bertram, a young man obviously smitten with her from the start. It takes the entire running time of the film for the young lovers to discover they always did love each other, but along the way we're treated to some interesting episodes of British class distinction amid the manners and mores of a bygone era, including some sharp bits of humor.Interesting that after essaying this quiet, unassuming role, Jonny Lee Miller would next take on the fight against a vampire in Dracula 2000. So much for British dexterity and range.Summing up: Some admirers of the novel seem to be put off by this one, but I have to admit I enjoyed it, even if I did find Fanny's inconsistent feelings about her suitor,Henry, and her inability to make up her mind, rather frustrating at times.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",4,Handsome version of the Austen story...,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,1891,"['had', 'trouble', 'enjoying', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'had', 'comparison', 'make', 'novel', 'never', 'read', 'saw', 'nothing', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'catering', '1999', 'sensibilities', 'use', 'scene', 'where', 'someone', 'caught', 'flagrante', 'Aside', 'indiscretion', 'dialog', 'seemed', 'authentic', 'Austen', 'whole', 'affair', 'been', 'expertly', 'photographed', 'England', 'course', 'lush', 'locales', 'are', 'breathtakingly', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'swirling', 'camera', 'swerves', 'often', 'interior', 'room', 'vast', 'horizons', 'greatest', 'ease.And', 'course', 'British', 'cast', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'praised', 'highly', 'enough', 'perform', 'manor', 'born', 'appropriate', 'style', 'FRANCES', ""O'CONNOR"", 'who', 'closely', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'poor', 'girl', 'sent', 'live', 'rich', 'relatives', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'who', 'elegant', 'young', 'woman', 'writer', 'Sounds', 'suspiciously', 'author', 'inserting', 'character', 'role', '.And', 'JONNY', 'LEE', 'MILLER', 'Edmund', 'Bertram', 'young', 'man', 'obviously', 'smitten', 'start', 'entire', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'young', 'lovers', 'discover', 'always', 'did', 'love', 'other', 'way', ""'re"", 'treated', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'British', 'class', 'distinction', 'manners', 'mores', 'bygone', 'era', 'including', 'sharp', 'bits', 'humor.Interesting', 'essaying', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'role', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'would', 'next', 'take', 'fight', 'vampire', 'Dracula', '2000', 'So', 'much', 'British', 'dexterity', 'range.Summing', 'up', 'admirers', 'novel', 'seem', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'one', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'did', 'find', 'Fanny', 'inconsistent', 'feelings', 'suitor', 'Henry', 'inability', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'times.']",Mansfield Park VHS
482160,A2Z1TPSSZHN5BB,6305892806,N.,"[17, 28]","Patricia Rozema's 1999 screen adaptation of Mansfield Park caused nary a stir in the box office at the time of its release, but Janeites/Austenites and period film lovers (two groups that are by no means interchangeable) have for years internet-battled over whether the film is in fact faithful to Austen's novel. This review is my attempt to help bridge the gap between the two camps. My thesis: Rozema knows and respects the source novel so well that, through clever reconfiguration, she has paid Austen's work due tribute and captured the sprit of, while not Fanny herself, Mansfield Park and its other inhabitants.Having read all of Jane Austen's major works and some of her juevenilia and letters, and having first read and re-read said works before viewing any screen adaptations of them, I am suitably acquainted with Austen and her milieu. However, I am not so Austen-centric as to consider myself a Janeite, and I am an all-around lover of the cinema; I thus fall as much as possible into the informed ""middle.""Note: I will NOT be reviewing this movie's aesthetic and film merits, which are many. In particular, Lesley Barber's excellent piano-based score and Michael Coulter's deft cinematography are reason enough to see the film. Also, if you dismissed the ""slavery song"" over the credits (Salif Keita's ""Djonga"") as too postmodern or activist or anachronistic, don't overlook this song, which, from a musical perspective, stands on its own merits.I first saw Rozema's film in the early 2000's. However, at that time, I had not (re)-read Mansfield Park in about ten years, so the book was not fresh in my mind, leading to my initial conclusion that the picture was indeed a very liberal (read: unsatisfactorily divergent) adaptation of Austen's work. But I have enjoyed the movie more and more over the years, and felt it was time to re-read MP with the film in mind.Having just re-read MP this past week and re-screened the movie and its commentaries, I am happy to report that Rozema's Complete Divergences--that is, places in which she presents information or characters that appear either fabricated or directly at odds with Austen's own-- are in fact few, and less reprehensible than they may at first seem.Here, as I see them, are the Complete Divergences:1. *Fanny Price, external personality and employment*Austen's novel: Fanny appears to be a physically fragile, perhaps overly-prudent young woman who is a bit too anxious to please and a bit too hasty to forgo the limelight, even when she is deserving of it. Fanny spends much of her time fetching tea and other things for her aunt Bertram; any stolen moments of freedom are employed in reading biographies, histories, and non-risque novels.Rozema's external Fanny: a hardy and hale horse-racing lass who views herself primarily as a budding writer a la a young Jane Austen, penning letters, short stories, and biographies which she shares with a choice few. This Fanny, although still conscious of her low position in the family hierarchy, is more quick to speak up for herself and on behalf of others (slaves, for example).2. *Susan and William Price, Fanny's siblings*Austen's novel: William, a young naval recruit, is Fanny's beloved elder brother, to whom she writes often and who unwittingly figures into some plot points. Susan is the blunt-talking, assertive but amiable younger sister who becomes Fanny's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e.Rozema: excises William and, likely for the sake of screenplay economy, folds him into Susan's character, producing one cherished sibling to whom Fanny writes. In the book, William is essentially a cipher for Fanny's feelings, so this works fine.3. *Dr. And Mrs. Grant of the Parsonage at MP*Rozema has also excised this pair of peripheral characters.4. *Aunt Norris' Cheapness*The delightfully mooching, liberal-with-everybody's-money-but- her-own Aunt Norris of Austen's novel has a reduced role in Roxema's picture, likely due to runtime concerns.5. *Julia's Elopement*Glossed over in Austen's book, this elopement was completely cut out of Rozema's screenplay.6. *References to Slavery*Again, glossed over in Austen's book: Fanny tells Edmund that she asked Sir Thomas about the slave trade (at that time, Britons were debating over the international abolishment of slavery) but we do not see her questioning him, and nobody issues an outright polemic against the institution. Thus, we know both Austen, her contemporary readers, and her MP characters are well aware of West Indies slavery and its likely relation to the Bertram family's estate in Antigua; however, we do not see inside any one's character head or hear their voices on the issue. Rozema, of course, has in her movie brought the issue front and just-peripheral-of-center.7. *Adultery on MP premises*The adultery scene onto which Rozema's heroine stumbles did not take place at Mansfield Park. In the novel, all of ""Mrs. R's and Mr. C's"" sexual liaison takes place off-scene in other parts of England, and is only reported on in a newspaper and by third parties.8. *Henry's Wooing of Fanny*Austen's Henry Crawford does not rejoice in the hasty betrothal acceptance proferred by Rozema's Fanny/Jane Austen alter-ego (Jane Austen once accepted and then refused a suitor in the same way). No starlings or other birds were sent to Fanny in Portsmouth (see below).Of the above changes, the most notable is Fanny Price's character. However, note that while Rozema has greatly altered the external Fanny (fragile tea-fetcher and put-upon Girl Friday), Frances O'Connor's portrayal of the inner Fanny--the passionate, sensitive young woman with a core of steel--nonetheless is spot-on in terms of Austen's characterization. Austen's heroine is a socially-skittish wallflower who, having allowed herself to be worn down and belittled by her wealthier, self-important relations, is all too happy to remain on the sidelines, where she feels deeply every slight, articulating to the reader her powerful emotions.  Yet Austen's Fanny finds the will and the strength to flat-out defy the threats, cajolements, and harangues of an imposing Uncle, meddling Aunt, and a smooth-talking brother-and-sister duo intent on Fanny's marriage to a man she neither loves nor trusts. Rozema and O'Connor faithfully bring to life this Fanny; witness O'Connor's shaky but defiant ""I will NOT"" to Harold Pinter's Sir Thomas.The second most visible change is the emphasis on slavery which, again, was something Austen clearly--though briefly--referenced in her book. Rozema has probably erred in turning Sir Thomas into an unrepentant and brutal slavemaster who sexually abused his female slaves. THAT is, I will allow, a bit of a stretch, especially given the reconciliatory changes Austen confers on his character toward the end of the novel, and Fanny's growing respect and fondness for him. I think Rozema could have compromised by showing Fanny discovering a book of slave logs or receipts in Sir Thomas' study. Remember that the novel is all about captivity, and that the Bertram children and Fanny are all, in their own ways, like slaves, like starlings who ""can't get out"" from under their powerful father's expectations.Speaking of starlings, let's talk about the numerous, delightful little ways in which Rozema culls bits and pieces from the novel and convincingly reworks them. For example, although Austen's Henry does not, like Rozema's,  read the starling-poem with Fanny--in fact, in the novel, it is Maria who invokes the bird imagery--Rozema recognizes that Fanny, like Austen's Maria, would also resonate with the idea of birds in captivity, and works that reference into Fanny's scenes instead. Yet Rozema does not strip the ascription from Maria, who in both the film and book outright states, ""I can't get out.""In re-reading this book with the film in mind, I was astonished at how much of the screenplay is lifted wholesale from Austen's narrative, turned into dialogue, and assigned, appropriately, to characters. Returning to the movie Maria: her entire speech to her father, in which she resigns herself to a loveless marriage, is taken, verbatim, from several paragraphs in the novel revealing Sir Thomas' own thoughts. Similarly, in the novel, Mary Crawford writes a letter to Fanny in which she reveals her mercenary interest in Tom's death and Edmund's possible promotion to heir-apparent. Later in the novel, we learn from Edmund that Mary has revealed even more appalling bad taste by wishing marriage on the wayward adulterers and wanting to bring them back into the Mansfield fold. Rozema capitalizes on the dramatic potential of this letter and hearsay by giving us a scene in which Mary says all the exact same things, only to the Bertrams'--and the audience's--face.Other little touches are simply Austen's characterizations exaggerated and magnified for the screen. Rozema, for example, takes the novel's unbelievably indolent and spacy and ""out-to-lunch"" Lady Betram and shows us her over-fondness for imbibements of the ""medicinal"" kind. I think this is a clever way to add to the characterization of a character that, in the novel, is not assigned sufficient causation  (Austen mentions in passing that both Lady Bertram and her sister Price are indolent and thoughtless ""by nature,"" while Aunt Norris just happens to be an industrious hyper-organizer).Oh, and that horse Rozema's Fanny races? It's called Shakespeare, owing to novel-Fanny's love for the Bard, and how, in the novel, Edmund observes Fanny's pleasure in the recitation of Shakespeare's plays. The horse, like the gold chain that was not included in the movie, demonstrates Edmund's underlying regard for Fanny.A multitude of other examples exists to convince the skeptical viewer that, in fact, Rozema's Mansfield Park is a more than acceptable version of Austen's--it is Austen's fictional world, condensed for the screen but conscientiously so, divergent in some details but not without due reason or inspiration, and yielding surprisingly successful results.In short, even avowed Janeites owe it to Jane's novel and her characters--and yes, as Rozema points out, her life--to explore this movie and compare it side by side with the book. Don't do as I did and dismiss this picture as ""unfaithful"" without having read the book within a year of first screening the movie. In fact, I suggest watching the movie one weekend, and then picking up the novel (whether for the first time or, like me, for the fifth) and reading it with the movie still fresh in your mind. I think you will be pleasantly surprised,Rozema not only clearly knows this novel inside and out, but she enjoys and admires it; I believe a director-screenwriter on less intimate terms with the book would have produced a movie perhaps more ""faithful"" to the surface actions of Austen's characters than to, like Rozema's Mansfield Park, their inner lives and emotional states.",4,More faithful to

482163,A24JMUNUOVABHP,6305892806,NovelReader,"[9, 13]","Mansfield Park is a terrific novel and, in this version, a terrific movie, even though i agree with other reviewers that the two are not telling the same story.  The movie is quite honest about saying, in the credits, that it is based on BOTH Mansfield Park and other early writings of Jane Austen.  The result is that the movie follows, for the most part, the story of ""Mansfield Park the novel"" except that the character of the novel's heroine Fanny has been replaced by a character more like (what the screenwriters imagine was) Jane Austen herself.  For instance, in the movie Fanny is a writer (she isn't one in the book), and she says lines that are actually from Austen's early History of England and Northanger Abbey.  Other than this massive change in Fanny, however, the plot and rest of the characters are fairly true to those in ""Mansfield Park the novel.""  Yes, Fanny's favorite brother has been replaced with a favorite sister, some lines are changed from the words of one character into the words of a different character, and (what is more unnerving) the unspoken possibility in the novel that Sir Thomas Bertram could own slaves in the West Indies is shouted from the rafters here.  Still, i can't help loving the movie's light touch and terrific performances every time i watch it, and I particularly think that the Crawfords are characterized to perfection.  The movie does a great job showing how the morally suspect Henry and Mary Crawford could nevertheless be attractive enough amid their faults to serve as temptations to Fanny and Edmund.Now would it have been better if they had just let Fanny be the ""novel Fanny""?  It might have been a better adaptation, but I doubt it would be a better movie.  The struggles of ""novel Fanny"" are mostly private--she sits by suffering while everyone else in the book (except Edmund) practically ignores her.  The BBC movie version gets much closer to showing ""novel Fanny""--and the BBC version is nearly unwatchable.  I suspect the reason there's no true--and good--adaptation of ""Mansfield Park the novel"" is that the struggles of one girl's insides just can't be easily translated into the visual realm of film.",4,"Not totally like the novel, but quite enjoyable in its own right",1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,2175,"['Mansfield', 'Park', 'terrific', 'novel', 'version', 'terrific', 'movie', 'even', 'i', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'telling', 'same', 'story', 'movie', 'quite', 'honest', 'saying', 'credits', 'based', 'BOTH', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'other', 'early', 'writings', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'result', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'novel', 'character', 'novel', 'heroine', 'Fanny', 'been', 'replaced', 'character', 'more', 'what', 'screenwriters', 'imagine', 'was', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'instance', 'movie', 'Fanny', 'writer', ""n't"", 'one', 'book', 'lines', 'are', 'actually', 'Austen', 'early', 'History', 'England', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'Other', 'massive', 'change', 'Fanny', 'however', 'plot', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'fairly', 'true', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'novel', 'Yes', 'Fanny', 'favorite', 'brother', 'been', 'replaced', 'favorite', 'sister', 'lines', 'are', 'changed', 'words', 'one', 'character', 'words', 'different', 'character', 'what', 'more', 'unnerving', 'unspoken', 'possibility', 'novel', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Bertram', 'could', 'own', 'slaves', 'West', 'Indies', 'shouted', 'rafters', 'here', 'Still', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'loving', 'movie', 'light', 'touch', 'terrific', 'performances', 'time', 'i', 'watch', 'particularly', 'think', 'Crawfords', 'are', 'characterized', 'perfection', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'morally', 'suspect', 'Henry', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'could', 'nevertheless', 'be', 'attractive', 'enough', 'faults', 'serve', 'temptations', 'Fanny', 'Edmund.Now', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'just', 'let', 'Fanny', 'be', 'novel', 'Fanny', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'adaptation', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'movie', 'struggles', 'novel', 'Fanny', 'are', 'mostly', 'private', 'suffering', 'everyone', 'else', 'book', 'Edmund', 'practically', 'BBC', 'movie', 'version', 'much', 'closer', 'showing', 'novel', 'Fanny', 'BBC', 'version', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'suspect', 'reason', 'true', 'good', 'adaptation', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'novel', 'struggles', 'one', 'girl', 'insides', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'easily', 'translated', 'visual', 'realm', 'film']",Mansfield Park VHS
482164,ADRVMQCT63M85,6305892806,Olene Quinn,"[3, 5]","The makers ought to have just wrote their own script if this is what they planned on doing, but marketing will win over, I suppose. There is little resemblence between this and Jane Austen's novel.On its own, it's a good enough film. The villains are very bad and the heroine is likable enough, even if she does seem almost bi-polar at times. It is no surprise that she is oddly written, what with the spunk put into a character that is not supposed to have any. Of course, the basic plot points don't work with this new-found backbone and so they go back to shy Fanny Price when needed.

This is just one person's opinion, but I think that's the wrong way to go. When I want pure Jane Austen, I read.I think that if a filmmaker goes to the time and effort to make a movie from a favorite book, they have the right to interpret and get creative. (If you disagree, you should probably just stay away from this movie.)I thought that infusing Fanny with a little of Jane Austen's personality (through her letters and early writing) was a charming reinvention that didn't change Fanny in her essentials. She is still uncompromisingly moral and still trusts herself unflinchingly.I appreciated the film's focus on the slave trade. It added a lot to the characters of Sir Thomas and Tom to contrast the world of manners with the barbaric ""interests in Antigua"" that make it all possible. The issues and the manner in which they were addressed were historical and they added to the plot. The rich had worse vices than bored housewives, after all.Edward was not a very compelling romantic lead in this movie. I thought that was its weakest point.

I mean, it says right there in the official Amazon description, ""Mansfield Park is an 'autobiographical novel'""---it is NOT! Of all the novels, MP is probably the LEAST so; and while Austen was very careful to put realistic life-experiences in her fiction, none of them can be said to be strongly autobiographical, no matter how much fans and critics want them to be.As someone who completed his Master's thesis on Austen, I know whereof I speak! When Austen novels began to hit the screen back in the '90s, I remember telling a friend--""They'll never do Mansfield Park; or they'll transform Fanny completely---which changes the entire main point of the book. MP is supposed to emphasize Fanny's INNER qualities, so Austen had to nearly eliminate the exterior traits of the pretty, perky, outwardly appealing heroine."" Those, of course, went to Fanny's devious counter-part, Mary Crawford.So, while it's a well-produced film, it's nowhere NEAR Austen's most controversial novel---controversial not because of the issue of slavery, but because most modern readers (along with a few of Austen's contemporaries) don't want a modest, retiring heroine. Which is fine; but then make another movie that doesn't pretend to be based on the book. It's like taking Dickens' Christmas Carol and making Scrooge kind-hearted but misunderstood.

One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: ""His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving"". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: ""No man suffers pains of love on the stage."" For dealing with the infatuated man: ""You have wounded yourself, but not with love.""This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.Well-made period romance films are: ""Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940"", ""Wives & Daughters"", ""North & South"". Fairly made is ""Under the Greenwood Tree"".

482186,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305892806,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 14]","Considering the fact that Jane Austen was not exactly the most prolific novelist of all time - she basically completed about half a dozen lengthy works in her short lifetime - it seems inconceivable that, after the recent  onslaught of films derived from her works, there remain any left available  for adaptation.  Yet, here is the latest, a film version of what many  consider to be one of her weaker efforts, ""Mansfield Park,"" a tale set,  like all her stories, in the pleasant countryside of early 19th Century  England.  Faced as they were with the obvious inferiority of the source  material and the prospect of building a film around what is universally  admitted to be one of Austen's drabbest heroines, the filmmakers obviously  decided to risk updating the material by bringing a more modern, socially  conscious sensibility to the proceedings.  Predictably, many Austen purists  have balked at the screenwriter's injection of so sanguinary a subject as  the slave trade into the author's carefully isolated and circumscribed  world of genteel manners and quaint social customs.  In addition, the film  even provides a glimpse of passionate lovemaking that, while insignificant  by today's filmic standards, may well jolt the true Austenphile into a  state of palpitating agitation if not downright apoplexy (pass the smelling  salts someone; I feel a case of the vapors coming on)!Actually,  ""Mansfield Park"" emerges as a reasonably entertaining film, true to the  spirit of Austen in its sharp-witted dialogue and its exploration of  ever-shifting romantic relationships that are the staples of all the  author's works.  The protagonist, Fanny Price, sent off at a young age to  live as the ""poor relation"" at her relatives' estate in the country, has  been made less the passive observer she was in the novel and more a woman  of action and decision.  The film essentially concerns itself with the  romantic travails of this kindhearted, clear-eyed young woman as she copes  with the haughtiness, facades and deceptions of a number of the people  around her.  Even though the story seems at times a pale reiteration of  themes and plot devices developed to more effectiveness in the author's  ""Pride and Prejudice,"" the complexity of both the characters and the  storyline keep one intrigued for most of the film's running time.  As with  Elizabeth Bennet, Fanny discovers the realities of the true persona so  often hidden beneath deceptively simple surfaces and learns to accept a  world and the people living in that may not be quite in accordance with  one's stubbornly held pre-conceived notions.As to the inclusion of the  issue of the uncle's involvement in the slave trade, it is not, in and of  itself, a matter for immediate dismissal.  Just because Austen never  included it in any of her works doesn't mean that it is necessarily  irrelevant in helping to fill in the social background of the era  presented.  The problem, though, is that the subject is dealt with in such  a superficial manner that it seems tacked on as a too-obvious attempt to  render the time period more in tune with modern standards of equanimity and  social justice - as if our liberal consciences could not indulge themselves  guilt-free in the seeming triviality of these characters' over-sheltered  lives if we were not forced to notice that such a lifestyle was possible  only on the broken backs of human workhorses.  (One wonders if, in a film  set in modern times, we will now be subjected to discussions of the cruelty  and inhumanity of the treatment of migrant farm workers every time a  character indulges himself in a piece of fruit.  It is always so much  easier to point the finger of wagging shame at the barbarity of cultures  long passed from the scene than at our own).Luckily, writer/director  Patricia Rozema has been blessed with a first-rate cast of extraordinary  actors, including Embeth Davidtz as a fully fleshed-out version of Fanny,  and even playwright Harold Pinter, of all people, as Fanny's slave-owning  uncle.  Visually, the film is gorgeous, capturing the many-hued brilliance  of the tranquil English countryside and the dreary, somber grayness of  Fanny's impoverished seaside home with equal effectiveness.""Mansfield  Park"" is nowhere near the sparkling delight that ""Emma"" was.  Still, it  provides riches aplenty for those with a fondness for this time period and  the uniquely special joys Jane Austen's works provide.",3,flawed but enjoyable,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,4458,"['Considering', 'fact', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'most', 'prolific', 'novelist', 'time', 'basically', 'completed', 'dozen', 'lengthy', 'short', 'lifetime', 'inconceivable', 'recent', 'onslaught', 'films', 'derived', 'works', 'remain', 'left', 'available', 'adaptation', 'here', 'latest', 'film', 'version', 'what', 'many', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'weaker', 'efforts', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'tale', 'set', 'stories', 'pleasant', 'countryside', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'England', 'Faced', 'were', 'obvious', 'inferiority', 'source', 'material', 'prospect', 'building', 'film', 'what', 'universally', 'admitted', 'be', 'one', 'Austen', 'drabbest', 'heroines', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'decided', 'risk', 'updating', 'material', 'bringing', 'more', 'modern', 'socially', 'conscious', 'sensibility', 'proceedings', 'Predictably', 'many', 'Austen', 'purists', 'have', 'balked', 'screenwriter', 'injection', 'so', 'sanguinary', 'subject', 'slave', 'trade', 'author', 'carefully', 'isolated', 'circumscribed', 'world', 'genteel', 'manners', 'quaint', 'social', 'customs', 'addition', 'film', 'even', 'glimpse', 'passionate', 'lovemaking', 'insignificant', 'today', 'filmic', 'standards', 'may', 'well', 'jolt', 'true', 'Austenphile', 'state', 'palpitating', 'agitation', 'not', 'downright', 'apoplexy', 'smelling', 'salts', 'someone', 'feel', 'case', 'vapors', 'coming', 'Actually', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'film', 'true', 'spirit', 'Austen', 'sharp-witted', 'dialogue', 'exploration', 'ever-shifting', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'are', 'staples', 'author', 'works', 'protagonist', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'sent', 'off', 'young', 'age', 'live', 'poor', 'relation', 'relatives', 'estate', 'country', 'been', 'made', 'less', 'passive', 'was', 'novel', 'more', 'woman', 'action', 'decision', 'film', 'essentially', 'romantic', 'travails', 'kindhearted', 'clear-eyed', 'young', 'woman', 'haughtiness', 'facades', 'deceptions', 'number', 'people', 'Even', 'story', 'times', 'pale', 'reiteration', 'themes', 'plot', 'devices', 'developed', 'more', 'effectiveness', 'author', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'complexity', 'characters', 'storyline', 'keep', 'one', 'intrigued', 'most', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Fanny', 'realities', 'true', 'persona', 'so', 'often', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'surfaces', 'learns', 'accept', 'world', 'people', 'living', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'accordance', 'one', 'stubbornly', 'held', 'pre-conceived', 'notions.As', 'inclusion', 'issue', 'uncle', 'involvement', 'slave', 'trade', 'not', 'matter', 'immediate', 'dismissal', 'Just', 'Austen', 'never', 'included', 'works', ""n't"", 'mean', 'necessarily', 'irrelevant', 'helping', 'fill', 'social', 'background', 'era', 'presented', 'problem', 'though', 'subject', 'dealt', 'such', 'superficial', 'manner', 'tacked', 'too-obvious', 'attempt', 'render', 'time', 'period', 'more', 'tune', 'modern', 'standards', 'equanimity', 'social', 'justice', 'liberal', 'consciences', 'could', 'not', 'indulge', 'guilt-free', 'seeming', 'triviality', 'characters', 'over-sheltered', 'lives', 'were', 'not', 'forced', 'notice', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'possible', 'only', 'broken', 'backs', 'human', 'workhorses', 'One', 'film', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'will', 'now', 'be', 'subjected', 'discussions', 'cruelty', 'inhumanity', 'treatment', 'migrant', 'farm', 'workers', 'time', 'character', 'piece', 'fruit', 'always', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'point', 'finger', 'wagging', 'shame', 'barbarity', 'cultures', 'long', 'passed', 'scene', 'own', '.Luckily', 'writer/director', 'Patricia', 'Rozema', 'been', 'blessed', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'extraordinary', 'actors', 'including', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'fully', 'fleshed-out', 'version', 'Fanny', 'even', 'playwright', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'people', 'Fanny', 'slave-owning', 'uncle', 'Visually', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'capturing', 'many-hued', 'brilliance', 'tranquil', 'English', 'countryside', 'dreary', 'somber', 'grayness', 'Fanny', 'impoverished', 'seaside', 'home', 'equal', 'effectiveness', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'nowhere', 'sparkling', 'delight', 'Emma', 'was', 'Still', 'riches', 'aplenty', 'fondness', 'time', 'period', 'uniquely', 'special', 'joys', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'works', 'provide']",Mansfield Park VHS

Nevertheless, I shouldn't have to, and the  movie should stand on its own feet.  The story of how young Fanny Price  escapes a crude life with her family in Portsmouth to become a servant in  the magnificent &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; manages to build up to soemthing  several times through the film, only give up.  Already intelligent and  imaginative when she first leaves home, Fanny grows into more intelligent  and beautiful young woman, more than Sir Thomas' daughters.  Yet the film  gives Fanny's wit little bite, and tool little of that is alotted to her  unwanted suitor.  Fanny much prefers sir Thomas' pious son, but that  romance seems inexplicably obstructed by his engagement to the slyly amoral  Mary Crawford.  Are we really to believe that Edmund, comntemplating the  life of a cleric, would propose to the seductive Crawford?  And why would  she accept, being openly contemptuous of a life that spurns materialism.  Edmund seems to much a cypher without Mary Crawford: he keeps Fanny  supplied with paper, quills and attention as Fanny grows into a young  woman, but he becomes all too serious as a young man, and it's hard to  visualize him growing up on Fanny's spicy prose.  Fanny's position seems  comfortably settled between servant and family, but she remains a servant,  a member of the lesser class, and the consequences of her refusal to marry  the conceited Mr. Crawford destroy the illusion...only for it to return  when Fanny is called back to Mansfield Park from exile.  Sir Thomas' other  son, the sole beneficiary - under primogeniture - of the elder Bertram's  fortune, is slowly going insane at the prospect of an inheritance that  includes a slave colony in Antigua.  Thomas' fevered sketches of Antigua  seem almost modeled after those taken of the European concentration camps  of the last world war.  Yet Thomas is barely a presence in the film and his  redemption, as well as both the elder Bertram's divestment from the slave  trade and the racist attitudes upon which he rationalizes it are all  cavalierly discarded by the end of the film, never tied to gether or  convincingly addressed.Still, the actring is crisp and conveys what  viewers may not be able to get from the words themselves, and Mansfield  Park itself is the perfect setting.  Containing not rooms as much as  enclosed spaces as voluminous as caverns, it appears to open and  claustrophobic when the scene requires it.",4,When does the book come out?,965606400,"08 7, 2000",2000,2534,"['Having', 'failed', 'read', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'movie', 'Nevertheless', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'should', 'stand', 'own', 'feet', 'story', 'how', 'young', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'crude', 'life', 'family', 'Portsmouth', 'become', 'servant', 'magnificent', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'build', 'up', 'soemthing', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'only', 'give', 'up', 'Already', 'intelligent', 'imaginative', 'when', 'first', 'home', 'Fanny', 'more', 'intelligent', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'more', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'daughters', 'film', 'Fanny', 'wit', 'little', 'bite', 'tool', 'little', 'alotted', 'unwanted', 'suitor', 'Fanny', 'much', 'prefers', 'sir', 'Thomas', 'pious', 'son', 'romance', 'inexplicably', 'obstructed', 'engagement', 'slyly', 'amoral', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'Are', 'really', 'believe', 'Edmund', 'comntemplating', 'life', 'cleric', 'would', 'propose', 'seductive', 'Crawford', 'why', 'would', 'accept', 'being', 'openly', 'contemptuous', 'life', 'materialism', 'Edmund', 'much', 'cypher', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'Fanny', 'supplied', 'paper', 'quills', 'attention', 'Fanny', 'young', 'woman', 'all', 'too', 'serious', 'young', 'man', 'hard', 'visualize', 'growing', 'up', 'Fanny', 'spicy', 'prose', 'Fanny', 'position', 'comfortably', 'settled', 'servant', 'family', 'servant', 'member', 'lesser', 'class', 'consequences', 'refusal', 'marry', 'conceited', 'Mr.', 'Crawford', 'illusion', 'only', 'return', 'when', 'Fanny', 'called', 'back', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'exile', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'other', 'son', 'sole', 'beneficiary', 'primogeniture', 'elder', 'Bertram', 'fortune', 'slowly', 'going', 'insane', 'prospect', 'inheritance', 'slave', 'colony', 'Antigua', 'Thomas', 'fevered', 'sketches', 'Antigua', 'seem', 'almost', 'modeled', 'taken', 'European', 'concentration', 'camps', 'last', 'world', 'war', 'Thomas', 'barely', 'presence', 'film', 'redemption', 'as', 'well', 'elder', 'Bertram', 'divestment', 'slave', 'trade', 'racist', 'attitudes', 'are', 'cavalierly', 'discarded', 'end', 'film', 'never', 'tied', 'gether', 'convincingly', 'addressed.Still', 'actring', 'crisp', 'conveys', 'what', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'words', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'perfect', 'setting', 'Containing', 'not', 'rooms', 'as', 'much', 'enclosed', 'spaces', 'as', 'voluminous', 'caverns', 'open', 'claustrophobic', 'when', 'scene']",Mansfield Park VHS

I loved it and would definately put it at the top of the best Austen adaptations. I use the term adaptation loosely since the film isn't exactly the same as the novel. It's better to think that the film used the Austen novel as a springboard. The story itself involves Fanny Price who goes to live at her rich relative's home at a young age. She becomes close with their son Edmund Bertram, and eventually grows to love him. But the arrival of the Crawford family seems to have made quite a mess of it. Edmund begins courting Mary Crawford, the older, worldly sister. Her brother Henry is attracted to the engaged Mariah Bertram, but eventually falls in love with Fanny. However, Fanny does not trust him and still longs for Edmund to return her love. It sounds like a soap opera but rises above this level because of it's wit and tantalizing characters. Frances O'Connor ('A.I.') and Jonny Lee Miller ('Trainspotting', very handsome) as Fanny and Edmund, share a boiling chemistry. Embeth Davidtz as Mary plays the part with obvious joy and zest. Alessandra Nivola as Henry also has the perfect mix of charm and danger about him. The direction is also marvelous with great period touches. The gorgeous English countryside becomes another character. Overall, it's not a great adaptation, but if you're like me and love period romance films, especially those with wit and charm, then see it, definately.",5,A delightful and wickedly fun period piece,1038700800,"12 1, 2002",2002,1497,"['woman', 'who', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'films', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'film', 'was', 'wrong', 'loved', 'would', 'definately', 'put', 'top', 'best', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'use', 'term', 'adaptation', 'loosely', 'film', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'same', 'novel', 'better', 'think', 'film', 'used', 'Austen', 'novel', 'springboard', 'story', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'who', 'live', 'rich', 'relative', 'home', 'young', 'age', 'close', 'son', 'Edmund', 'Bertram', 'eventually', 'love', 'arrival', 'Crawford', 'family', 'have', 'made', 'quite', 'mess', 'Edmund', 'courting', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'older', 'worldly', 'sister', 'brother', 'Henry', 'attracted', 'engaged', 'Mariah', 'Bertram', 'eventually', 'love', 'Fanny', 'However', 'Fanny', 'not', 'trust', 'still', 'longs', 'Edmund', 'return', 'love', 'soap', 'opera', 'level', 'wit', 'tantalizing', 'characters', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'A.I', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', ""'Trainspotting"", 'very', 'handsome', 'Fanny', 'Edmund', 'share', 'boiling', 'chemistry', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'Mary', 'part', 'obvious', 'joy', 'zest', 'Alessandra', 'Nivola', 'Henry', 'also', 'perfect', 'mix', 'charm', 'danger', 'direction', 'also', 'marvelous', 'great', 'period', 'touches', 'gorgeous', 'English', 'countryside', 'character', 'Overall', 'not', 'great', 'adaptation', ""'re"", 'love', 'period', 'romance', 'films', 'especially', 'wit', 'charm', 'then', 'see', 'definately']",Mansfield Park VHS

I've read all of her books and there is always a little bit of cynicism and satire of the upper class society in them.  I think Fanny was well portrayed, though not entirely as like she was in the book.  I do think that it was a good move on the part of the screen writer to make her more confident as she matured though, that is usually how most people are anyway.  Bertram was portrayed rather well, as were most of the characters.  I think that a little more time should have been spent on Edward though, he was, after all, the love of Fanny's life.As a portrayal of life at that time, I found it to be excellent.  It brought up many points in history that were issues at the time.Overall, I'd have to say that I'd recommend the movie to anyone who loves Jane Austen.  One must be forgiving to screen writers when it comes to turning a book into a movie.  Some plots are just too intricate.

482196,A2AFM0SLLFPSJ1,6305892806,"Savant11 ""Savant11""","[5, 16]","Don't listen to all the bashers of this film who criticize it because it isn't 100% accurate to the book. This is an elitist view from a bunch of purists who don't have a grasp of what film making is supposed to be about.  In the beggining titles the movie blatantly states that the movie is based on the book &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; by Jane Austen as well as her own life.Mansfield Park is a story about a young girl Fanny Price who goes to live with her rich relatives.  But instead of being accepted by her relatives as one of their own.  She is mostly used as domestic help especially by her Aunt Norris (a character which JK Rowling borrowed in Harry Potter)whose only esteem in the entire movie comes from bullying poor Fanny.  The only person who is kind to Fanny is her cousin Edmund.  Fanny grows actually to fall in love with Edmond but can do nothing about it because they are out of each others social circle. During the course of the movie a diletante brother and sister moves into the neighborhood and have wide spread reprocussions on Fanny and Edmond. There is also a bit of social commentary on slavery and how the family supports iself. Tom's drawing of the treatment of the slaves are horrifying, but true to form. African slaves who were brought to the Americas were treated worse than animals, and it is remarkable how this has not been addressed yet.I really enjoyed this movie very much.  Not so much from the story itself but from the solid acting and the feelings that are shown.  I especially loved Francis O'Connor (Fanny) and Alexandro Nivola (Henry) I think that they had very strong chemistry and played well to each other.

482200,A2CVVCODXDVJO6,6305892806,Shirley Li,"[10, 17]","After reading all of Austen's novels, I do consider myself a pretty ardent and faithful fan.  And of course I have long waited eager anticipation for Rozema's daring adaption of Austen's most controversial and complex novel.  I can assure you the after-taste of my fist viewing was quite nameless.  First of all, no film should be condemned for being discursive from the  book, and Rozema should definitely be applauded for what she attempted with  this classic. The original novel is the darkest in theme among Austen's  known works, and Rozema has a keen eye for the sparks lurking in the  darkness of Mansfield Park and she captures them well with her camera and  her dialogues. At times however, one feels the political aspect of slave  trade is rather too patent, yet the arguments do provide a fertile ground  for the character Fanny Price to blossom.  Frances O'Connor subtly takes  away the painfully shy, clumsy country girl and presents us a revolutionary  young woman of the new ages.  The rest of the cast is brilliant as well and  they fit nicely into the niches painted by Rozema.  Some say Austen would  be rolling in her grave for the bold liberty Rozema takes: Sir Bertram's  unexplored sexual exploits, virtue of wealth, and worth of love for  example; but all works out for modern viewers who are more or less tempted  by the same conceptual doubts, be it 2006 or 1806.  So don't call me an  infidel for giving this &quot;rebel&quot;, brow-raiser 5 stars, only a true  admirer of Austen's spirit can probe to such depth and uncover the courage  of Fanny.  After all, Austen was a rebel for her age, and through Rozema's  witty script, superimposing Austen's own toiling youth against Fanny's  literary fancies, are we able to sigh in relieve and curtsey in response to  the towering strength of one woman.",5,"Certainly a brow-raiser, not in the way you'd think though",964656000,"07 27, 2000",2000,1824,"['reading', 'Austen', 'novels', 'do', 'consider', 'pretty', 'ardent', 'faithful', 'fan', 'course', 'have', 'long', 'waited', 'eager', 'anticipation', 'Rozema', 'daring', 'adaption', 'Austen', 'most', 'controversial', 'complex', 'novel', 'can', 'assure', 'after-taste', 'fist', 'viewing', 'was', 'quite', 'nameless', 'First', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'condemned', 'being', 'discursive', 'book', 'Rozema', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'applauded', 'what', 'attempted', 'classic', 'original', 'novel', 'darkest', 'theme', 'Austen', 'known', 'works', 'Rozema', 'keen', 'eye', 'sparks', 'lurking', 'darkness', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'well', 'camera', 'dialogues', 'times', 'however', 'one', 'political', 'aspect', 'slave', 'trade', 'rather', 'too', 'patent', 'arguments', 'do', 'provide', 'fertile', 'ground', 'character', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'blossom', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'subtly', 'away', 'painfully', 'shy', 'clumsy', 'country', 'girl', 'presents', 'revolutionary', 'young', 'woman', 'new', 'ages', 'rest', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'well', 'fit', 'nicely', 'niches', 'painted', 'Rozema', 'say', 'Austen', 'would', 'be', 'rolling', 'grave', 'bold', 'liberty', 'Rozema', 'Sir', 'Bertram', 'unexplored', 'sexual', 'exploits', 'virtue', 'wealth', 'worth', 'love', 'example', 'out', 'modern', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'tempted', 'same', 'conceptual', 'doubts', 'be', '2006', '1806', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'infidel', 'giving', 'quot', 'rebel', 'quot', 'brow-raiser', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'true', 'admirer', 'Austen', 'spirit', 'can', 'probe', 'such', 'depth', 'uncover', 'courage', 'Fanny', 'Austen', 'was', 'rebel', 'age', 'Rozema', 'witty', 'script', 'superimposing', 'Austen', 'own', 'toiling', 'youth', 'Fanny', 'literary', 'fancies', 'are', 'able', 'sigh', 'relieve', 'curtsey', 'response', 'towering', 'strength', 'one', 'woman']",Mansfield Park VHS

In the novel, she's withdrawn and self-effacing, as you would expect, given her situation.  Having been separated from her family as a child, taken in by rich relatives as a charity case, and reminded daily of her inferiority by her mean-spirited Aunt and snooty female cousins, would she really have grown up to be the self-confident, assertive young woman we see in this adaptation?  I don't think it's very likely, and neither did Jane Austen.  Nevertheless, the new, &quot;improved&quot; Fanny plays better to a modern audience, so that's who we've got as our heroine -- but it wreaks havoc with the plot, doesn't it?  Would this Fanny be truly happy with the introspective, serious Edmund?  She almost seems a better match for the fractious Henry Crawford.Not only the characters have changed; there's an addition to the plot as well.  The moral issue of slavery, not even addressed in the novel, is tossed in, seemingly on a whim.  I could almost give credit to the director for trying something daring and thought-provoking, if only it had been handled with a little more finesse, but this wasn't.  What's worse, the entire issue was left unresolved.  It felt as if the director merely added the slavery sub-plot to bring some excitement to an otherwise sedate story, then abandoned it.  I thought it was tacky, and couldn't see any real added value (aside from those lovely sketches - blechh).In the end, I sort of enjoyed this movie... but only AFTER I'd given up comparing it to the book.  Important events seemed rushed, which you'd expect with only 2 hours to get things wrapped up, but the main points were touched on, and it all works out pretty much the same.

482222,A3L8CZT6T4K4PC,6305892806,Toni Kamsler,"[7, 10]","The first and foremost criticism you will hear for this film is that it does not slavishly follow Jane Austen's original novel. This is, in fact, true. For one, certain political issues (slavery) are brought to the forefront in a perhaps heavy-handed way that would constitute my only personal detraction from the film's worth. Certain plot elements are edited: in the novel, the preparations for the play that is abruptly cancelled take up a significant amount of text. And certain characters are much changed in manner and motivation, but more on that later.Despite these liberties taken with the original, &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; remains a superbly enjoyable film with the spirit of Austen intact, if not the letter or the law. Her heroine, Fanny Price, still has the same spirit and sensibilities that she was written to have, and her story -- that of a poor girl sent to live with her wealthy relatives, subsequently falling in love with her cousin Edmund -- is as fraught with emotion and upheaval as ever. A plot element I find especially keen is the downfall of Edmund's sister Mariah after her infidelity; Austen leaves no hope for Mariah's recovery here, whereas in &quot;Pride & Prejudice&quot;, Lydia Bennett's living in sin with a dashing young officer who is forced to marry her is swept somewhat under the carpet. A side note, definitely, but an interesting contrast.Returning to &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, the character that undergoes the most startling transformation in this film adaptation is Henry Crawford, brother of Mary; both are enterprising and manipulative sophisticates intent on infiltrating the Betram family. In the novel, and in other previous film versions, Henry and Mary are an entirely matched pair -- both self-involved and self-serving. Here, Mary retains a black widow-type predatory slant, but Henry is given a new depth. He begins as the worst of playboys, chasing after Mariah Betram before (and after, as it turns out) her marriage, but here hsi pursuit of Fanny turns serious. He truly seems to fall in love with her, or at least in love with the man he could become if he were with her, which is in fact the most profound possibility of all. When Fanny briefly accepts his marriage proposal, we understand why, because his feelings do appear to be sincere; when she calls the engagement off, however, we see the inevitably of this decision, even barring her love for Edmund. Fanny might have &quot;been the making&quot; of this Henry, for there seems to be some hope for his sincerity. When he reverts to his immoral ways, however, after her rejection, we, along with Fanny, accept the sad truth that his transformation was only skin deep. This entire character exploration of Henry Crawford is not contained in the original novel, but (though many purist Austen fans will disagree) the film is the better for it.",4,Adaptation,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,2862,"['first', 'foremost', 'criticism', 'will', 'hear', 'film', 'not', 'slavishly', 'follow', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'original', 'novel', 'fact', 'true', 'one', 'certain', 'political', 'issues', 'slavery', 'are', 'brought', 'forefront', 'perhaps', 'heavy-handed', 'way', 'would', 'constitute', 'only', 'personal', 'detraction', 'film', 'worth', 'Certain', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'edited', 'novel', 'preparations', 'play', 'abruptly', 'cancelled', 'take', 'up', 'significant', 'amount', 'text', 'certain', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'changed', 'manner', 'motivation', 'more', 'later.Despite', 'liberties', 'taken', 'original', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'superbly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'spirit', 'Austen', 'intact', 'not', 'letter', 'law', 'heroine', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'still', 'same', 'spirit', 'sensibilities', 'was', 'written', 'have', 'story', 'poor', 'girl', 'sent', 'live', 'wealthy', 'relatives', 'subsequently', 'falling', 'love', 'cousin', 'Edmund', 'fraught', 'emotion', 'upheaval', 'ever', 'plot', 'element', 'find', 'especially', 'keen', 'downfall', 'Edmund', 'sister', 'Mariah', 'infidelity', 'Austen', 'hope', 'Mariah', 'recovery', 'here', 'whereas', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'Lydia', 'Bennett', 'living', 'sin', 'dashing', 'young', 'officer', 'who', 'forced', 'marry', 'swept', 'somewhat', 'carpet', 'side', 'note', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'contrast.Returning', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'character', 'most', 'startling', 'transformation', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'brother', 'Mary', 'are', 'enterprising', 'manipulative', 'sophisticates', 'intent', 'infiltrating', 'Betram', 'family', 'novel', 'other', 'previous', 'film', 'versions', 'Henry', 'Mary', 'are', 'entirely', 'matched', 'pair', 'self-involved', 'self-serving', 'Here', 'Mary', 'black', 'widow-type', 'predatory', 'slant', 'Henry', 'given', 'new', 'depth', 'worst', 'playboys', 'chasing', 'Mariah', 'Betram', 'out', 'marriage', 'here', 'hsi', 'pursuit', 'Fanny', 'serious', 'truly', 'fall', 'love', 'least', 'love', 'man', 'could', 'become', 'were', 'fact', 'most', 'profound', 'possibility', 'When', 'Fanny', 'briefly', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'understand', 'why', 'feelings', 'do', 'appear', 'be', 'sincere', 'when', 'engagement', 'however', 'see', 'inevitably', 'decision', 'even', 'barring', 'love', 'Edmund', 'Fanny', 'might', 'have', 'quot', 'been', 'making', 'quot', 'Henry', 'there', 'be', 'hope', 'sincerity', 'When', 'immoral', 'ways', 'however', 'rejection', 'Fanny', 'accept', 'sad', 'truth', 'transformation', 'was', 'only', 'skin', 'deep', 'entire', 'character', 'exploration', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'not', 'contained', 'original', 'novel', 'many', 'purist', 'Austen', 'fans', 'will', 'disagree', 'film', 'better']",Mansfield Park VHS

I think in many ways it is. A movie SHOULD attempt to interpret a novel, not just offer moving pictures to go along with the texts. And the interpretation of this particular Jane Austen film is very much in the spirit of Austen herself.I've read the novel(actually not one of my favorites either). And this film refuses to go for the easy target that we modern folks want these period pieces to do so often-envision this very idealistic time period that's full of rolling hills and romantic courtships. It really gets down to the gritty reality of a woman's status during this time period and how the family and the relationships within this unit are run like a corporation alot of the times.Understanding how the social context affects how these various relationships in Austen novels interact in various ways is key to understanding Austen and her keen eye for social commentary.

482224,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,6305892806,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[0, 2]","I've never read the book Mansfield Park so I can't really attest to the accuracy, but as a stand-alone Period Piece, I was less than impressed. I live for these kinds of films. For me, there is no greater perfection than Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility. I'm a big Jane Austen fan, but I just haven't gotten around to reading this particular novel of hers. However, I am just going to assume, that it was no way as risqu&eacute; as this film! There are a few scenes here that left me bewildered and sort of stunned. Lewd stares and leers, artisitic depictions of rape and abuse, and a creepy uncle/niece vibe that I just couldn't shake.So the story goes: A 10 year old, very poor girl named Fanny was somehow chosen to live with her incredibly wealthy relatives at Mansfield Park. She believes it is only temporary but she remains there for years, growing up, and doing...well, I'm not sure exactly what her role is supposed to be in the new household. Here is where I started losing interest, and it was only 10 minutes into the film... Is Fanny supposed to be a servant or helper? A ward? For someone who was brought up in such a poverty-stricken environment, she is incredibly bright and learned. Now obviously it appears her education was continued at the Park, but these are all assumptions. In once scene she is seen serving her aunts, and in another she is galloping away on a horse with Edmund, her Uncle's youngest son. She is clearly enjoying her time and life there. She writes(alot), horses around, and is usually in good-spirits. And then in another scene she is being dismissed by her aunt like a servant. It's somewhat confusing.Frances O' Conner as Fanny is a decent choice, but a bit too old in my opinion. She is not entirely likable either. Her relationship with Edmund seems sincere and sweet, but then at other times she just seems out of character. She accepts and then(the next morning) rejects a proposal from a handsome, wealthy man for reasons she is only guessing at. She deems him untrustworthy and false, but she doesn't mind flirting with him regardless. Oh, and she practically throws herself at him when she first agrees to his proposal, sealing it with a brow-raising kiss.I think the thing that really threw me off this film is, it just doesn't feel like a Jane Austen adaptation. The way the characters act and speak just feels innapropriate for the time period and just wrong for Austen. There are nice, bright moments here though that can't be denied, and once you get past the icky fact that Fanny and Edmund are (first) cousins, their relationship feels genuine and heart-felt.Besides plot and characters, I love looking at all the different costumes that usually come with any period piece. Once again I was dissapointed. Nothing seemed up to par and frankly, everything was just kind of boring. This is one film that is practially SCREAMING for a remake. It's time for a fresh start because I really think great things can be done with the proper director and actors.",3,Is this really Austen?,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,3007,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'attest', 'accuracy', 'stand-alone', 'Period', 'Piece', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'live', 'kinds', 'films', 'greater', 'perfection', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', ""'m"", 'big', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fan', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'reading', 'particular', 'novel', 'hers', 'However', 'am', 'just', 'going', 'assume', 'was', 'way', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'here', 'left', 'bewildered', 'sort', 'stunned', 'Lewd', 'stares', 'leers', 'artisitic', 'depictions', 'rape', 'abuse', 'creepy', 'uncle/niece', 'vibe', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake.So', 'story', '10', 'year', 'old', 'very', 'poor', 'girl', 'named', 'Fanny', 'was', 'somehow', 'chosen', 'live', 'incredibly', 'wealthy', 'relatives', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'only', 'temporary', 'there', 'years', 'growing', 'up', 'doing', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'role', 'supposed', 'be', 'new', 'household', 'Here', 'where', 'started', 'losing', 'interest', 'was', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'Fanny', 'supposed', 'be', 'servant', 'helper', 'ward', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'such', 'poverty-stricken', 'environment', 'incredibly', 'bright', 'learned', 'Now', 'obviously', 'education', 'was', 'continued', 'Park', 'are', 'assumptions', 'once', 'scene', 'seen', 'serving', 'aunts', 'galloping', 'away', 'horse', 'Edmund', 'Uncle', 'youngest', 'son', 'clearly', 'enjoying', 'time', 'life', 'there', 'alot', 'around', 'usually', 'good-spirits', 'then', 'scene', 'being', 'dismissed', 'aunt', 'servant', 'somewhat', 'confusing.Frances', 'O', 'Conner', 'Fanny', 'decent', 'choice', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'opinion', 'not', 'entirely', 'likable', 'either', 'relationship', 'Edmund', 'sincere', 'sweet', 'then', 'other', 'times', 'just', 'character', 'then', 'next', 'morning', 'proposal', 'handsome', 'wealthy', 'man', 'reasons', 'only', 'guessing', 'untrustworthy', 'false', ""n't"", 'mind', 'flirting', 'regardless', 'Oh', 'practically', 'when', 'first', 'proposal', 'sealing', 'brow-raising', 'kiss.I', 'think', 'thing', 'really', 'threw', 'off', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'adaptation', 'way', 'characters', 'act', 'speak', 'just', 'feels', 'innapropriate', 'time', 'period', 'just', 'wrong', 'Austen', 'are', 'nice', 'bright', 'moments', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'once', 'get', 'icky', 'fact', 'Fanny', 'Edmund', 'are', 'first', 'cousins', 'relationship', 'feels', 'genuine', 'heart-felt.Besides', 'plot', 'characters', 'love', 'looking', 'different', 'costumes', 'usually', 'come', 'period', 'piece', 'Once', 'again', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'Nothing', 'seemed', 'up', 'par', 'frankly', 'everything', 'was', 'just', 'kind', 'boring', 'one', 'film', 'practially', 'SCREAMING', 'remake', 'time', 'fresh', 'start', 'really', 'think', 'great', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'proper', 'director', 'actors']",Mansfield Park VHS

My only beef is perhaps with the whole West Indies incident, but it does not jar with the story as portrayed.  Believe me, the opium situation is a great explanation for the completely insipid Lady Bertram, and the sexuality of the movie is completely in keeping with the implied scandal leading to Maria Bertram's fall from grace.  Fanny is drawn as a young woman with strong convictions, who is played much more vocally than in the book, but Fanny was adamant in her unwillingness to sacrifice her principals in any degree, so a forte performance in a movie seems to be a much better choice than implied suffering, in my opinion.  Frances O'Connor was an inspired choice for Fanny: lovely, but not too beautiful; eyes full of personality; and a sort of suppressed sexuality that has to be present for Henry Crawford to be at all attracted to.

Mitchell ""vwm""","[2, 4]","I realize that this movie isn't 100% true to the book, but I forgive them because I truly believe that Jane herself would like the spunkiness of this Fanny. There are a few seconds of screen time that I wish they hadn't inserted in a couple of places (all fans know just what I'm talking about). Jane herself was obstinately non-political, and that is the biggest change they made in this movie that probably would bother Jane, but it does so much to help us understand Tom, that I am forgiving.

However, if you want a different slant into that time period, with lots of behind-the-back intrique, then buy this one!  It kept me captivated throughout the whole movie; first, wondering how Fannie would ever fit in, and then - would she ever find true love?  In between, she has to grapple with situations that some might find uncomfortable - for instance, when she comes across Tom's notebook.  WARNING!  The drawings are VERY GRAPHIC in nature!!!  It denotes a time that some would like to forget; but it happened, and there it is.  She also has to find her heart and stay true to her own deteremined path.
