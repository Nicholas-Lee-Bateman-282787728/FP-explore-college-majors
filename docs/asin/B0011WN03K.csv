1133370,A20NTWL30HBNYE,B0011WN03K,"Chris B ""Kuklapolitan""","[2, 2]","This is an early film with a stellar cast including movie greats and staples such as C. Aubrey Smith, Thomas Mitchell, Mary Astor, Raymond Massey, Jerome Cowan, Movita, John Carradine and starring Dorothy Lamour and the new boy on the lot, Jon Hall, who would go on to please every kid on every Saturday morning in America as Ramar, Of The Jungle!.  The special effects are astounding for the time in which it was done and the story is just terrific in every way.  From the extreme prejudice of the British Governor, amply played by Raymond Massey and the opposing views of his wife and tolerant counterpart, Mary Astor to the meanness of John Carradine...this film is a pip and a must see for any film buff out there.  Natives living on an island, a tropical paradise, become discouraged by the manner in which DeLaage, the Governor, conducts things to the letter of the law and beyond in a place that should be relaxed and left to blossom in its own beauty.  That in combination with a legal sentence imposed on Terangi (Jon Hall) during a sea voyage to Papeete, Tahiti during the lay-over for striking a &#34;White Man&#34; that is doubled, tripled and quadrupled every time he tries to escape and swim back to his beloved island and back to his the wife, Marama (Dorothy Lamour) he had newly wed make this a hotbed for disaster  The hurricane is the game changer and really something to witness.  You can almost feel the winds as you sit and watch in anticipation of the outcome.",5,The Hurricane (1937),1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,1483,"['early', 'film', 'stellar', 'cast', 'including', 'movie', 'greats', 'staples', 'such', 'C.', 'Aubrey', 'Smith', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Jerome', 'Cowan', 'Movita', 'John', 'Carradine', 'starring', 'Dorothy', 'Lamour', 'new', 'boy', 'lot', 'Jon', 'Hall', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'please', 'kid', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'America', 'Ramar', 'Jungle', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'astounding', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'story', 'just', 'terrific', 'way', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'British', 'Governor', 'amply', 'played', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'opposing', 'views', 'wife', 'tolerant', 'counterpart', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'meanness', 'John', 'Carradine', 'film', 'pip', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'buff', 'there', 'Natives', 'living', 'island', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'become', 'discouraged', 'manner', 'DeLaage', 'Governor', 'things', 'letter', 'law', 'place', 'should', 'be', 'relaxed', 'left', 'blossom', 'own', 'beauty', 'combination', 'legal', 'sentence', 'imposed', 'Terangi', 'Jon', 'Hall', 'sea', 'voyage', 'Papeete', 'Tahiti', 'lay-over', 'striking', '34', 'White', 'Man', '34', 'doubled', 'tripled', 'quadrupled', 'time', 'escape', 'swim', 'back', 'beloved', 'island', 'back', 'wife', 'Marama', 'Dorothy', 'Lamour', 'had', 'newly', 'wed', 'make', 'hotbed', 'disaster', 'hurricane', 'game', 'changer', 'really', 'something', 'witness', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'winds', 'sit', 'watch', 'anticipation', 'outcome']",The Hurricane All Regions

1133375,A14ADG0TTI4XBV,B0011WN03K,"Scott Coblio ""kookoo guy""","[0, 0]","When this movie starts, all I could really think about was how pretty Dorothy Lamour was, how modern-looking Jon Hall was, and how charmingly unconvincing they were as Polynesians, each remembering their &#34;accents&#34; only about half the time.However, once the story gets going, it does pull you in, and the film is never boring, with the plot twisting in unexpected ways so that, by the end, the film has encompassed many genres--action, drama, suspense, melodrama, and finally, disaster flick. I wasn't expecting much from the special effects, considering this was made in 1937 but boy, when that hurricane hits, you'll be surprised how real it looks and how suspensefully the sequence is managed.In some ways, it was MORE exciting than a modern day disaster flick because you know everything you're seeing was really there. They didn't have many tricks back then. If a person is seen getting hit by a wall of water moving 60 MPH, chances are, they  really were!  I actually got uncomfortable watching it becuase it seemed at so many points as if the actors lives (or at least well-being) must have been endangered getting some of the shots.But the film makers have done just enough character development for us to care what happens to Dorothy, Jon and the other inhabitants of the island. Raymond Massey somewhat overplays the villain of the piece, while Mary Astor does the best she can with an illogical character that is too compassionate and smart to be with such a guy.Like I said, it's got  a little of everything. I don't know if I'd want to watch it again and again, but I'm glad i saw it and I think if you like old movies, it should be in your film-history vernacular.",4,Prototypical Disaster Movie Has Heart,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,1685,"['When', 'movie', 'could', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'how', 'pretty', 'Dorothy', 'Lamour', 'was', 'how', 'modern-looking', 'Jon', 'Hall', 'was', 'how', 'charmingly', 'unconvincing', 'were', 'Polynesians', 'remembering', '34', 'accents', '34', 'only', 'time.However', 'once', 'story', 'going', 'pull', 'film', 'never', 'boring', 'plot', 'twisting', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'so', 'end', 'film', 'encompassed', 'many', 'genres', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'melodrama', 'finally', 'disaster', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'considering', 'was', 'made', '1937', 'boy', 'when', 'hurricane', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'real', 'how', 'suspensefully', 'sequence', 'managed.In', 'ways', 'was', 'MORE', 'exciting', 'modern', 'day', 'disaster', 'flick', 'know', 'everything', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'was', 'really', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'tricks', 'back', 'then', 'person', 'seen', 'getting', 'hit', 'wall', 'water', 'moving', '60', 'MPH', 'chances', 'are', 'really', 'were', 'actually', 'got', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'becuase', 'seemed', 'so', 'many', 'points', 'actors', 'least', 'well-being', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'endangered', 'getting', 'shots.But', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'done', 'just', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'care', 'what', 'Dorothy', 'Jon', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'island', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'somewhat', 'villain', 'piece', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'best', 'can', 'illogical', 'character', 'too', 'compassionate', 'smart', 'be', 'such', 'guy.Like', 'said', 'got', 'little', 'everything', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'saw', 'think', 'like', 'old', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'film-history', 'vernacular']",The Hurricane All Regions
