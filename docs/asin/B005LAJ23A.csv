Dale walked around with a floppy hat and didn't have to make the hard decisions and sacrifices like Shane, Rick, Andrea, and the rest of them. What Dale didn't realize is that little jerk is not a 'kid' he looks well into his late 20's and his posse of 30 men or so would end up raping the women and children and burning the whole farm down. Dale is delusional and a self-appointed self important philosopher with nothing to back it up. The world has NEVER been civilized.  Remember Genghis Khan? Stalin? Pol Pot? Woodrow Wilson? I can go on and on...The world has always been dependent on individuals who take risk and sacrifice their lives so people like Dale have the luxury to grown old and fat and sit around judging. So he's gone like most marxist marie antoinettes...their delusions of utopia always ends up in a gulag in cambodia or a gulag under Stalin or in a FEMA camp. I like the series and zombies are not that far fetch of an idea...just look at the zombies in the UN and the House and Senate sucking the life and liberty out of individuals everywhere.

Is how I would explain this Blu-Ray release.I'm sure the HD quality of Blu-Ray is the best way to watch the only prime time show about the Zombie Apocalypse, but it comes at a very slow narrative price. The first season of The Walking Dead was perfect. I will not waste time saying that because I had an absolute blast watching it the first two or three times. I was okay with the differences from the comic vs TV show in the short 7 episode season.So naturally I was excited that season 2 was going to be longer with 13 episodes. Let's just say the confusion of Frank Darabont and other writers leaving didn't help the narrative situation. What they left before the mid season break was an absolute boring narrative that could be explained in 5 seconds, literally. I hate to be the reviewer that thinks this, but ""This show does have zombies, right?"" And yes, as a fan of the comics, I understand that it's not just about that, it's about how the main characters survive. It's neat to see the integration of Hershel, Maggie, and the farm come into the story, but that was it. After the mid season break, new writers and directors came into play allowing the story to progress a bit faster this time. However, after the drudgery of ""Where's Sofia!?"" God, it was hard to recover from that because the Walking Dead was becoming a chore to watch. And it should never be that! Jon Bernthal's acting was starting to get redundant with the constant head bobbing while talking approach. I'm from the south and I guarantee that not all of us talk to you like we have serious ADD problems. I had 0 issues with the 7 episodes of Shane in the first season. But the entirety of the second season of Head-bobbing dialogue? siiiiigh. My wife and I were yelling at the TV ""WHY AREN'T YOU DEAD YET?!"" Even Andrew Lincoln didn't help with his acting method.However, the final 6 episodes did start moving in a better direction. Even though it was in a meandering path having the same issues of moving the narrative forward, it did get better. So Walking Dead or zombie horror fans, by all means, add this to your collection. You are still viewing probably the best if not only way the Zombie Apocalypse can be shown on Prime Time Television. Just expect this to be a boring chapter compared to Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore/Charlie Adlard's version. By the end of season two, just hope the show moves the narrative forward at an entertaining pace, not a stagnant one.",3,"Too Much Talkie-Talkie, not Enough Bitey-Bitey.",1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,2500,"['words', 'why', 'still', 'issue', 'how', 'would', 'explain', 'Blu-Ray', 'release.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'HD', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'only', 'prime', 'time', 'show', 'Zombie', 'Apocalypse', 'very', 'slow', 'narrative', 'price', 'first', 'season', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'was', 'perfect', 'will', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'saying', 'had', 'absolute', 'blast', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'was', 'okay', 'differences', 'comic', 'vs', 'TV', 'show', 'short', '7', 'episode', 'season.So', 'naturally', 'was', 'excited', 'season', '2', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'longer', '13', 'episodes', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'confusion', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'other', 'writers', 'leaving', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'narrative', 'situation', 'What', 'left', 'mid', 'season', 'break', 'was', 'absolute', 'boring', 'narrative', 'could', 'be', 'explained', '5', 'seconds', 'literally', 'hate', 'be', 'reviewer', 'show', 'have', 'zombies', 'right', 'yes', 'fan', 'comics', 'understand', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'main', 'characters', 'survive', 'neat', 'see', 'integration', 'Hershel', 'Maggie', 'farm', 'come', 'story', 'was', 'mid', 'season', 'break', 'new', 'writers', 'directors', 'came', 'play', 'allowing', 'story', 'progress', 'bit', 'faster', 'time', 'However', 'drudgery', 'Where', 'Sofia', 'God', 'was', 'hard', 'recover', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'was', 'becoming', 'chore', 'watch', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'acting', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'redundant', 'constant', 'head', 'bobbing', 'talking', 'approach', ""'m"", 'south', 'guarantee', 'not', 'talk', 'have', 'serious', 'ADD', 'problems', 'had', '0', 'issues', '7', 'episodes', 'Shane', 'first', 'season', 'entirety', 'second', 'season', 'Head-bobbing', 'dialogue', 'siiiiigh', 'wife', 'were', 'yelling', 'TV', 'WHY', 'ARE', ""N'T"", 'YOU', 'DEAD', 'YET', 'Even', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'acting', 'method.However', 'final', '6', 'episodes', 'did', 'start', 'moving', 'better', 'direction', 'Even', 'was', 'meandering', 'path', 'having', 'same', 'issues', 'moving', 'narrative', 'forward', 'did', 'get', 'better', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'zombie', 'horror', 'fans', 'means', 'add', 'collection', 'are', 'still', 'viewing', 'probably', 'best', 'not', 'only', 'way', 'Zombie', 'Apocalypse', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Television', 'Just', 'expect', 'be', 'boring', 'chapter', 'compared', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'Tony', 'Moore/Charlie', 'Adlard', 'version', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'just', 'hope', 'show', 'narrative', 'forward', 'entertaining', 'pace', 'not', 'stagnant', 'one']",The Walking Dead: Season 2

Also, people who love to see zombie-head-explosion, got a fine dose of that.I have trouble with the silly gender politics on the show. So, Andrea shoots like a girl. Then she has sex with Shane after he teaches her to be tough.Also, even though the morning after pill is not an ""abortion pill,"" that's what one character describes it as. Plus, Rick and his wife view the medicine with disgust (she vomits it kneeling in the dirt; he blows a gasket). If you cannot have an abortion while dodging homicidal zombies - when can you?I am very disturbed about the prospect of a pregnant Lori. Imagine the unnecessary male heroics that will center around protecting a pregnant white woman. It's already bad enough having 5 episodes dedicated to searching for a missing white girl.  A pregnant Lori will send male paternalism into high orbit.Also, the women on the show are behaving like stereotypes. They are all neurotic. One minute Shane has angered Andrea to the point that she runs from him. Within a few minutes, she's grabbing his crotch ready for sex. Lori wants the morning after pill so badly, that she asks Glenn to go and fetch them. Next, she is throwing them up and crying to Rick.  Glenn's sudden girlfriend goes with him to fetch the meds and then has a complete breakdown and slams the ""abortion pills"" on the table. She also goes crazy from the prospect of losing Glenn (whom she only recently met).  Glenn is trying to have a serious discussion with her and she suddenly starts kissing him passionately.

Season 2 includes the same cast from Season 1, with some excellent additions such as Herschel and Maggie.  There is a sub-plot tension of a love triangle between Lori, Rick and Shane which boils to a zombie fiesta conclusion.  The best episode of the series is the one where the barn door comes open.  Excellent acting by the leads, Andrew Lincoln especially good.  The music is excellent as well, complementing the tension.

Brown,"[0, 0]","I will say at the start that, while I read Kirkman's comics before watching any episode of the show, I'm not a long-time reader or greatly enamored of them.  But, I definitely appreciate the first volume.  In this episode, we finally get to the powerful moments of that book's final pages... and the TV script butchers it.  The main botchery is that the big ""reveals"" were given away several episodes ago, in a manner that makes me wonder if somehow marital secrecy has acquired a stronger taboo for screenwriters than those that used to apply to marital infidelity.  But, even considered as a self-contained unit, this does a gross injustice to the source material.  There's no sense of surprise in the final confrontation, even on the part of the characters, and without that, Rick just seems ""felony stupid"".  And THEN the most dramatic moment of all is reduced to an afterthought.And then there's a technical quibble that's a big one to me: Given the amount of head trauma that even regular people have been known to survive (see the famous case of Phineas Gage), the ""shoot them in the head"" doctrine of the zombie genre doesn't make a great deal of sense.  (I've openly taken issue with this in my own zombie fiction.)  But, if anything is going to make even the undead go down and stay down, it's the destruction of the hind brain or the severing of the spinal column.

1493245,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B005LAJ23A,D. C. Obraztsov,"[3, 5]","Let me preface this by saying that I have NEVER been interested in zombie films or movies.  The closest experience I have to zombies is Resident Evil.  My boyfriend also hates zombies, and said they are the dumbest thing ever.  He said I would have to watch this show on my own.So, I watched one episode and was hooked.  And the boyfriend was too!  As you probably know, the show is set in a post-apocalyptic United States, and the country is being overrun by zombies.  Rick Grimes, a sheriff, was in a coma when the apocalypse came.  He somehow managed to wake up and get out of the hospital, and was on his merry way to find his wife and son.Rick ends up finding a lot more than just his wife and son.  There are places to go, people to save, mysteries to solve, and affairs and treachery to sort out.  I decided to take the gamble and convince my boyfriend to watch the first episode with me, and he was hooked as well!  And that is coming from a guy who has basically hated anything zombie he has ever seen (really, it was like pulling teeth to get him to give it a chance - and now he's dying for the next season).And yes, I do see some very strong similarities to Lost.  I am not trying to get into a big debate on which is better or whatnot, but there are definitely some similarities worth pointing out.  Not to mention, I noticed these similarities way before finding out that it was a common comparison.  Plus, if you are a Lost fan (and there are many), this may engage your interest.  Here are a few of those similarities:-a group of people who know nothing about each other live together and try to survive.  It brings up a lot of themes of loyalty, friendship, and the nature of people.-the show is VERY slow-paced. I watched seasons 1 and 2 back-to-back so this wasn't really an issue for me, but I know it drove a lot of people crazy. Lost was also extremely slow-paced, with plenty of cliffhangers.-it's so character-focused, that sometimes you forget about the other things around them.  Oh yeah, there are zombies in this?  I forgot for a second.  This show, like Lost, is truly about the characters.  How they feel, act, and the methods they take to survive.  The characters act like real people and I find a lot of empathy for some of them.  There are a couple of annoying ones, but there are still plenty zombies left in future seasons :)-Rick Grimes = Jack Shephard.  They both start out as the model citizens (a sheriff and doctor) who are always trying to do what's ""right and noble.""  They take great pride in honor and try to be the team leader.  However, they are both highly flawed and begin to unravel and turn more primitive and scared over time.-no one is safe!  Prepare for unfortunate and heart-breaking deaths.Overall, I am very, very impressed with this show so far.  In this day and age, it is difficult to create something zombie without making it look completely goofy.  Yet somehow, the show is still scary, suspenseful, and has many layers to it.  I would say that if you liked Lost, you will probably love The Walking Dead.  Also, you do NOT need to like zombies at all to like this show.  Like I said, zombies often seem like the backdrop.AMC is on a roll here.  Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and now The Walking Dead!

In most instances, the characters were not making sane decisions (the well incident in ""Cherokee Rose"" is a big blunder - as another reviewer once noted, why not go back to the highway and and bring back water from the truck they found in ""What Lies Ahead"").The writing also seemed less smart, more melodramatic and as the episodes progressed I felt like I was watching a bad version of Survivor that just happened to feature zombies (actually... ""a bad version of Survivor""...I'm giving the reality show too much credit...nonetheless...back to my point).I would say this was my favourite episode. Shane is my least favourite character but I would back him in a fight. A bit of a sociopath, he is closer to the voice of reason than Rick by the season's end. The finale outside of the barn was a kind of refreshing reality check for all the characters, even Rick. Though there was a layer of melodrama. Rick taking the scene closing shot, in a sense, ending what he started was a nice touch. Though I have to admit, I had a feeling it was going to end that way.Overall, this episode did save the season but not by much. If Season 3 is anything like Season 2 and less like Season 1, I'm going to stop watching. I noticed a drop in film quality as well.

1493284,A378B22B4X5W6I,B005LAJ23A,JCStreetSoldier,"[5, 8]","The biggest criticisms of season two are: slow pacing, too much soap opera drama (or as another reviewer said, ""too much talkie-talkie, not enough bitey-bitey""), not many zombies (until the second half of the season), Chandler Riggs (Carl) being an atrocious actor (but that's also the writers fault for not writing him more natural dialogue).Season two is a lot different than season one, and I'm not talking about the premise. I'm talking about pacing and cinematography, and there's a reason for this change (but I'll get to that later). But first, let's talk about what season two is. Season two is about the farm. You're stuck there the entire time--that's something best known up front. In season one, there were essentially half a dozen locations--in season two, there's essentially three locations but doubled the number of episodes of season one. So you can sort of see there's a problem with pacing. But, pacing is the BIGGEST (and almost only) FLAW in season two.The reason season two feels so different is because Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption (Single-Disc Edition),The Green Mile (Single Disc Edition),The Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)) left the show. He was the main producer of season one, and directed the fantastic hour and a half pilot episode from the first season. Here's the thing: by theory, not a whole lot happened season one, but Frank knows how to do a lot with nothing. I mean, technically Shawshank Repemption and The Green Mile were not action packed films, but Frank knows how to get audience reactions. Glen Mazzara doesn't. Glen Mazzara is an action producer (The Shield) that, for some reason, decided to make a very slow-paced season two (especially the first half--I think we all can agree on that). So, the question is, what use is an action producer if he's not making an action TV show? *Shrug*The second half of the season is when I really started enjoying it. Which is a shame, because I loved every episode of season one--and I only loved the a handful of episodes in season two. But season two is always the most awkward season. It's because it's in between one and three. I mean, let's look at books. How many people like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets the most in the Harry Potter series? I bet there's a small handful. So, I can't completely blame Glen, because there are VERY FEW shows in which season two has been ""better"" than season one. Breaking Bad might be one of the exceptions, possibly Dexter.Oh, and other than pacing . . . here's another big flaw: Chandler Riggs. The way Tom Hardy trained for The Dark Knight Rises, that's how the Producers of The Walking Dead needs to treat Chandler Riggs, the boy who plays Carl. I think all the fans of the show feel the same way; a lot of his dialogue is too forced; he tries to talk in a deeper voice than he has (and therefore hinders his acting ability); he doesn't know how to realistically act in front of Rick and Lori. Part of the problem is the writers of the show giving him lines that they should have realized that Chandler couldn't deliver.I think this is a very subtle, almost impossible to prove theory, but it makes sense. Mad Men thrives off from its relationship drama; Breaking Bad thrives from its intense dialogue and emotional cliff hangers; The Killing thrives (well, it does have a second season) from being a mystery: therefore most of the audience, who are primarily women, who watch the show are pleased, because they want to be fooled over and over and over again. The formula is simple:Equation: the killer who they thought was the killer wasn't the killer so there's another killer = The Killing (S2)And The Walking Dead looks to its counterparts and . . . it tries to be like them, instead of being what it should be. Look at it this way, Rubicon (a fantistic, compelling show with rich characters, an innovative plot, and was exactly what it needed to be) got cancelled after one season, and the release date on the DVD/Blu-Ray? Your guess is as good as mine. This is what happens to 'shows that don't comform to the norm: they are assassinated. Maybe it's fear that is holding The Walking Dead back from being what it truly needs to be. In the entire second season of The Walking Dead, there are only two episodes that I thought were pure genius and fit the zombie ""vibe."" Only two out of twelve. So much of the first half of the second season was trying to build soap opera elements instead of zombie folklore/Survival Horror elements. The fall of Rubicon might have been an element in Season 2's inability to take risks. Although, like I said, it's hard to prove.Ultimately, if season two of The Walking Dead contains all the episodes of The Talking Dead (with Chris Hardwick) then it's a must buy. But it's just not as good as season one . . . however, if you're a zombie fan, what else do you have to look forward to (aside from Resident Evil 6)?",4,"I don't have the DVD, but this review is for

Where is all the bleakness, horror and urgency that was so dominant in the first season? The desperation of the existential kind? The terror? The interpersonal struggles and drama that never got trite? The first season had a kind of sinister undertone to it. This one feels like a handful of sunshine as it is filled with episodes full of sappiness and sentimentalities and I still cannot get that touchy/feely soap opera style out of my head. This whole thing of drawing out the announcement of the pregnancy to Rick and the ""who is the father"" story line are just about two of the most tired clichees out there. They really should not be employing it in a series that set the stage for the zombie apocalypse quite beautifully. It just diminishes its quality.Yes it is great that the question of ""should we have a child in this zombie ridden world"" is posed, but that is also where it should end, rather than turning into melodrama and venturing off into soap territory with that love triangle stuck on top of that. If this had been the same show in caliber and intensity as the first season, Lori would have kept those abortion pills in, instead of throwing them up, resulting in a miscarriage and a sad but ""this is reality"" fall out afterwards; like we saw when Amy died. This would have allowed the story to shift from the trite cliche it is now to a story line more appropriate and in better alignment with the mood this show is to convey.Season 1 was all about survival and getting out of town, being scared all the time that a herd may pass by or a freak might attack you in the most unlikely moment; having to be on constant alert, always in panic mode and  scared of the darkness that was the unknown. It was about pure thrill and moving through this desert of the undead. Now they are all stuck on this farm succumbing to gossip, heart-ache and their personal feelings. Dont they have anything else, more urgent, to focus on, like  - I dont know -  survival and finding out what is going on in the world, rather than stick around on this farm and wonder who did whom and how Glenn feels about this girl and how her father feels about them? Blah Blah Blah...Which brings me to my next point: are they ever going to leave this darn place? Halfway through Season 2 and it has all taken place on this farm under the ruse of looking for a little girl who is probably dead. In fact, looking for this girl seems like a very improbable and rather artificial plot element thrown in from the writers to justify staying on location for this long because there is no way that they would just stick around in one place when there are so many unanswered questions. Remember it has only been about a week since Rick woke up in that hospital. All this has caused the show to become stagnant and invoke even more of that soap opera, boring snoozefest feeling that's been gnawing on my mind. Right now the focus is shifted toward the characters' personal melodrama and the minutiae of their lives.Moving along is very important here as it adds genuinely new elements and possibly characters to the show, ultimately enriching the experience, rather than making it feel tiresome and slow moving. Being stuck on this farm, doing an expos&eacute; on their feelings leaves them with too much time on their hands to start looking around and picking on each other; the ugliness of some personalities begin to seep through, creating drama. Being stuck on that farm is worse than working their way through the land it seems.On a good note, I like how the writers made the only people in here who are religious fanatics of some sort (is there any other kind) also be the exact same ones who think that zombies are just misunderstood and that medical treatment would make them human again. This juxtaposition of irrationality, first with religion and then with believing that zombies are good, is pretty interesting. It is no coincidence that the same people who, contrary to evidence, think that zombies are misunderstood are also the same ones who, again contrary to evidence, are highly religious and continue to hold on to their backwards religious beliefs in a world taken down by the living dead. The analogy here is striking. I also like the level of depravity we get to see in Shane as his role manifests.However, I think they seriously need to move on now because something else besides everyone finding out about the walkers in the barn, discussions on babies and puppy love and a showdown between the Herschels and the group has to be the highlight. I think all this is supposed to have taken place on a 3 day period, but it feels like weeks have passed; it is too slow and soapy.I miss the freakish grimness of the beginning, the terrifying desolation as they pass through empty landscapes and roads selectively populated by zombies, the desperation of days gone by. Now all that seems replaced by old, tired stereotypes, cheesy dialogues and characters you increasingly start to dislike.",3,"Too Much Drama, Too Soapy And I Wonder If They Ever Gonna Move Away From

This isn't great drama here. Its the traditionalist survivalist storyline thats been done so many times before. I don't usually like this kind of thing much, but the first season held my attention first for the quality and second for a certain degree of originality.But the second season is a waste of time. The budget of the series has been cut to nothing. Cheap props, cheap effects and every old trick-in-the-book is employed to cut the budget down to almost nothing. They hardly have sets and props. They pull out the old gimmick of the-search-for-the-lost-character and the injured-character-who-must-stay-in-bed to reduce the effective cost of the cast. We even get the very old ""single-character-lost-in-the-woods"" episode.And you can tell that the network or the producer must have been screaming at them about female viewer demographics because they pull out everything in that bag too: (1) endless relationship melodrama, (2) the lost/missing child, (3) pregenancy melodrama. (4) child in the hospital (5) constant bitching combined with threats of suicide and on and on. The story and the writing are just plain bad now.The entire season consists of mostly having the cast stand around at a farm. Even among cheap shows, this show sets a new standard for cheap.

Seriously, I find myself sitting on the couch and cheering for the zombies, which I am pretty sure is not the way it's supposed to go down. But as the show has progressed over both parts of Season 2, I keep hating so many of the characters more and more. In fact, the only characters I am mildly rooting for this season are Glen, Darryl, and maybe Carl...that's about it. Everyone else is a stupid you-know-what, and I want the zombies to eat their brains!!! (Most hated character this season: Lori Grimes, hands down. She is such a *^#&(!!! And her parenting skills make Betty Draper from ""Mad Men"" look like Mother of the Year. I'm just sayin'.)I guess you could say that my frustration is what Season 2 is all about. The zombie apocalypse continues, obviously, and virtually every character begins to lose it at some point (especially Shane...you have no idea). Ultimately, though, they all still piss me off, and I want them all to die and for the zombies to take over the world. And some of these moronic characters do die this season...and it's unexpected and AWESOME!!! Sadly, though, many of them will live to see Season 3. BUMMER. :(Without giving anything away, here is my take on this: the first half of Season 2 was a bit disappointing. I thought the overall pacing of the show was slower than Season 1. The same thing happened in the second half of Season 2, and then the last 10 minutes of the second-to-last episode of the season were AMAZING, and then the season finale kind of sucked.

Obviously, the producer and current crop of writers lost thier jobs when the 'Days of Our Lives' soap opera was canceled and were quickly hired to take over 'Walking Dead'.  Sure, it's a perfect fit, just create endless melodrama and throw in the occasional gore to keep the kiddies happy and you have a hit show. Right? What a huge disappoint 'Walking Dead' has become.

1493363,AIGIOGRIES1IK,B005LAJ23A,Panzermann,"[7, 13]","The inaugural season of The Walking Dead raised enormous expectations with its balanced blend of horror, action, and serious adult drama, coupled with high production values and hints that the series would play out on an epic scale. Season Two (aka ""Escape from Hershel's Boring Farm"") started to systematically undermine those expectations and change the very nature of the show.The action and horror elements quickly receded into the background after the brilliant herd sequence in the season opener. Every drama needs rising and falling tension, but the show dramatically slowed its pace, focusing on life at a Georgia farm, and morphing into a rather overwrought soap opera--a sort of ""One Life to Live"" with the occasional token zombie. The show's setting became so confined that it was easy to forget that there had even been a total breakdown of society; Season Two just wanted us to take it on faith that there was something scary over the hill. And without the horror elements, the show in essence becomes an American version of the BBC's post-apocalyptic series Survivors.Some rambling, repetitive writing and mediocre direction didn't help matters. (The lack of Frank Darabont's input this season is striking.) Those great ""Walking Dead Moments,"" where a character is stuck in a horrific situation and forced to make a gut-wrenching decision came less frequently or became so predictable that they ceased to make much impact.But stick it out: by the end of the season, things are mostly back in swing, and the show we came to love from Season One appears to be more or less back on track. There are some shocking and heartbreaking dramatic moments, as well as unexpected deaths. By the final episode, the group is again on the run, fighting to survive both the walkers and their own worse natures. (The show is at its best when it balances both those threats.) Now, if the creators and directors can balance the ethical/psychological elements with a renewed integration of action and zombie horror, we'll be in for a thrilling Season Three. If it's just a group of frightened, selfish, confused people bickering in a prison, it will be a requiem for what might have been.In Season Two, the makeup design is still superb, but the visual effects are still hit or miss, with too much of the spraying blood looking like dodgy, 300-style CGI. Audio effects are as comically over the top as in the first season: every time a walker is killed, it sounds like someone whacking a giant rotten watermelon with a sledgehammer. Once again, the show's comic book roots show, with characters performing utter miracles of marksmanship with the greatest of ease.(Btw, what's up with T-Dog? Is he a ""Red Shirt"" the producers forgot to kill? The poor character had maybe three lines in the entire second season. Apparently he spent most of his time snoozing in a hammock behind the farmhouse. Season Three will tell...)As for the Blu-ray/DVD set itself: be wise and wait for the inevitable Gold Platinum Extra-Special Super-Deluxe Edition that includes more extras than the initial release--as was done with the various releases of the first season.",3,"Promise Broken, Promise Redeemed?",1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,3142,"['inaugural', 'season', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'raised', 'enormous', 'expectations', 'balanced', 'blend', 'horror', 'action', 'serious', 'adult', 'drama', 'coupled', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'hints', 'series', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'epic', 'scale', 'Season', 'Two', 'Escape', 'Hershel', 'Boring', 'Farm', 'started', 'systematically', 'undermine', 'expectations', 'change', 'very', 'nature', 'show.The', 'action', 'horror', 'elements', 'quickly', 'receded', 'background', 'brilliant', 'herd', 'sequence', 'season', 'opener', 'drama', 'rising', 'falling', 'tension', 'show', 'dramatically', 'slowed', 'pace', 'focusing', 'life', 'Georgia', 'farm', 'morphing', 'rather', 'overwrought', 'soap', 'opera', 'sort', 'One', 'Life', 'Live', 'occasional', 'token', 'zombie', 'show', 'setting', 'became', 'so', 'confined', 'was', 'easy', 'forget', 'had', 'even', 'been', 'total', 'breakdown', 'society', 'Season', 'Two', 'just', 'wanted', 'take', 'faith', 'was', 'something', 'scary', 'hill', 'horror', 'elements', 'show', 'essence', 'American', 'version', 'BBC', 'post-apocalyptic', 'series', 'Survivors.Some', 'rambling', 'repetitive', 'writing', 'mediocre', 'direction', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'lack', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'input', 'season', 'striking', 'great', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Moments', 'where', 'character', 'stuck', 'horrific', 'situation', 'forced', 'make', 'gut-wrenching', 'decision', 'came', 'less', 'frequently', 'became', 'so', 'predictable', 'ceased', 'make', 'much', 'impact.But', 'stick', 'out', 'end', 'season', 'things', 'are', 'mostly', 'back', 'swing', 'show', 'came', 'love', 'Season', 'One', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'back', 'track', 'are', 'shocking', 'heartbreaking', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'unexpected', 'deaths', 'final', 'episode', 'group', 'again', 'run', 'fighting', 'survive', 'walkers', 'own', 'worse', 'natures', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'threats', 'Now', 'creators', 'directors', 'can', 'balance', 'ethical/psychological', 'elements', 'renewed', 'integration', 'action', 'zombie', 'horror', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thrilling', 'Season', 'Three', 'just', 'group', 'frightened', 'selfish', 'confused', 'people', 'bickering', 'prison', 'will', 'be', 'requiem', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been.In', 'Season', 'Two', 'makeup', 'design', 'still', 'superb', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'hit', 'miss', 'too', 'much', 'spraying', 'blood', 'looking', 'dodgy', '300-style', 'CGI', 'Audio', 'effects', 'are', 'comically', 'top', 'first', 'season', 'time', 'walker', 'killed', 'someone', 'whacking', 'giant', 'rotten', 'watermelon', 'sledgehammer', 'Once', 'again', 'show', 'comic', 'book', 'roots', 'show', 'characters', 'performing', 'utter', 'miracles', 'marksmanship', 'greatest', 'ease', 'Btw', 'what', 'up', 'T-Dog', 'Red', 'Shirt', 'producers', 'forgot', 'kill', 'poor', 'character', 'had', 'maybe', 'three', 'lines', 'entire', 'second', 'season', 'Apparently', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'snoozing', 'hammock', 'farmhouse', 'Season', 'Three', 'will', 'tell', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'set', 'be', 'wise', 'wait', 'inevitable', 'Gold', 'Platinum', 'Extra-Special', 'Super-Deluxe', 'Edition', 'more', 'extras', 'initial', 'release', 'was', 'done', 'various', 'releases', 'first', 'season']",The Walking Dead: Season 2

The quality seems to be good, and it looks great! I especially like the way they have put the words ""WALKING DEAD"" underneath the zombie head in bold silver letters.I made my purchase at BB, they had only one left in this big box, and the funny thing is the sales associate asked me if it was alright for him to take it out of the box and take a look at it out of curiousity since he had never seen one and I told him it was cool. He even took a picture of it on his cell phone. Then a couple who were buying a tv commented on how much they love The Walking Dead.I've placed this scary looking zombie right next to my television with the screwdriver intact! So, if you have any doubts about it, I say just go for it since it might not be around for too long or the price my increase when the quantites are limited. I paid 60 bucks for it. I haven't checked out the bluray as of yet but I'm pretty sure it's going to rock as well as the sound in 7.1 Dolby Digital. All in all, this is very highly recommended!Just an update: I looked at the figure again this morning, and I just wanted to say that the paint job on the zombie could have been a bit better and shinier perhaps as one person ( Craig ) has pointed out. He has definitely made some very good observations about the item even being somewhat different then the actual picture on the box, with which I am totally in sync! He's uploaded some excellent comparison pics and I have to say it now disappoints me to a certain degree seeing this! To be honest, it would have been cool to pay a few more dollars to get the zombie face exactly as it is shown on the box, but it is what it is I suppose!2nd update: 9-3-12:- I wanted to add that watching it on these discs is so much better as you have no commercial interruptions and it really immerses you into everything. I just can't get enough of it. I'm on my third disc and loving every second of it!

There's a little too much storytelling through dialog, the interior sequences are for the most part kinda boring, and zombies seem more like a nuisance than a global threat.There is clearly a cut in the production budget.

1493380,A2YSUZ7R9AGJIU,B005LAJ23A,"R. Reining ""Old School Zinger""","[0, 0]","Season 2 was a severe disappointment after the mostly focused story-line of season 1. I'm not a fan of horror or zombies in particular, but I wanted to watch the show because I do like the post-apocalypse genre. To be clear, I expected a lot of drama before I began watching season; but drama is only good when it makes sense. The short version of why I didn't like season 2 is this: the characters are all over the place. Maybe two or three are well-written and don't do things that make no sense, but there rest are just vessels through which the writers of the show like to squeeze out as much melodrama as possible, irritating me in the process.From about episode 2 on, I was bored. I don't need action to keep me paying attention, I need a focused narrative, and characters that do and say things that make sense...for their character. For the most part, it seemed to me that whenever the writers didn't know what to do, they would just have a character do something stupid, which would create a problem that doesn't add anything to the story. And that's how most of season 2 felt. Like there were two or maybe three things that were driving the story forward, and everything in between was just filler. I think it was seven or eight episodes in and the Sophia being lost in the woods story arc hadn't even been finished. By that point it seemed like her mom had already moved on, and didn't particularly care about finding her. Sure...I mean whatever. If she's not going to care, I don't care.And that's how I felt even throughout season 1. I don't particularly feel attached to any of the characters. Glenn is probably the strongest character, and the one whom doesn't do very many things that don't make sense. But I'm watching each episode just kind of passing the time, being bored through most of the drama because almost nothing happens in most of the episodes. We have to drive five minutes into town to go get Herschel, we'll be right back. Cool. Five hours later, the short trip has inevitably been turned into the entire episode, and then the pregnant woman decides to go off to rescue them on her own because obviously whatever is holding them up is something she can deal with. But of course she crashes her car, thus creating even more drama. And I'm sitting there just like...who cares? I don't care about any of these people because none of them are consistent. In a survival story you have to care about the people who are trying to survive. But everything is just a long argument that ultimately never gets resolved.I'm not saying that everyone should just work together happily. No doubt in a real-world scenario people would argue with each other and there would be drama. But I don't need eleven episodes of it. The Walking Dead is about a zombie apocalypse, but it shouldn't be about a zombie apocalypse. It should be about what comes after. How people collectively can regroup and decide how best to try to live. There are morality questions that are amateurishly addressed. The show should be poignant, offering up questions without actually having to ask them, and making the viewer wonder not just how they would feel in that characters' place, but about their own morality in the world we actually live in. These are things that have been awkwardly handled so far, and if I'm going to keep watching it needs to change.That said, another problem is some of the casting choices. Carl, the main protagonist's son, is horrible. Excuse the pun, but he can't act to save his life. And it doesn't help that whomever is writing the dialog for him clearly has no idea how an actual 13 year old speaks. Many (I'd say most) shows suffer from this, and it's not easy writing dialog for a very young person, but if that's the case his dialog should be kept to a minimum. It's laughably bad, and he ruins almost every scene he speaks in. I guess he's really the only actor I have a problem with, the rest I can chalk up just to the sub-par writing.All that negativity said, the season had a few high points. Without spoiling anything, it is finally revealed what Jenner told Rick before they left the CDC, and the Sophia story-line was completed in a way that made me respect the show more, though by that point I was extremely bored and irritated at all the pointless bickering. I can only hope season 3 is better. If it's not, I won't continue watching.",2,Oh the drama!

I feel if they really wanted to they could film different scenes giving us more in depth insight to the other characters and how they feel at times.  I barely even know anything about the black guy?  I mean he's the only black guy in the group and I was hoping he would have some cool attributes to bring to the group but they have him as a prop practically?  Seriously?  Ever since the farm, Daryl seems a little here and there and not included as much.  I think that guy is so interesting to watch, yet they are filming some retarded girl in a bed getting five star treatment because she can't take the pressure.Lori talks about the nights getting colder indicating winter is approaching and you would assume they would be trying to gather supplies or ensure they can make it through the winter but so far this entire idea of surviving seems to take a seat while they debate this guys fate because they can't figure out what the hell they want to do with him.  I get the whole concept of feeling the pressure of deciding his fate but my God do we need to drag out the entire episode over it?  Should of been less than 1/4 episode discussing this guys fate.The point im trying to make here is there is TONS of stuff they can pack into an episode.  If they want to drag the cast staying on the farm for so long at least have them explore, gather, go on missions anything to where we don't have to watch a Post Apocalyptic U.S Congress argueing over a bill for a month.Any how I thought the ending of this episode was descent but it happend all at once and felt most of this episode was just some what boring.  They've had some exciting episodes this was'nt one of them :(",3,Still love the show but I agree with some of the reviewers to some degree,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1906,"['still', 'love', 'watching', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'time', 'however', 'get', 'annoying', 'many', 'characters', 'just', 'seem', 'absent', 'picture', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'episodes', 'feel', 'really', 'wanted', 'could', 'film', 'different', 'scenes', 'giving', 'more', 'depth', 'insight', 'other', 'characters', 'how', 'feel', 'times', 'barely', 'even', 'know', 'anything', 'black', 'guy', 'mean', 'only', 'black', 'guy', 'group', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'have', 'cool', 'attributes', 'bring', 'group', 'have', 'prop', 'practically', 'Seriously', 'Ever', 'farm', 'Daryl', 'little', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'included', 'much', 'think', 'guy', 'so', 'interesting', 'watch', 'yet', 'are', 'filming', 'retarded', 'girl', 'bed', 'getting', 'five', 'star', 'treatment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'pressure.Lori', 'talks', 'nights', 'getting', 'colder', 'indicating', 'winter', 'approaching', 'would', 'assume', 'would', 'be', 'trying', 'gather', 'supplies', 'ensure', 'can', 'make', 'winter', 'so', 'far', 'entire', 'idea', 'surviving', 'take', 'seat', 'debate', 'guys', 'fate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'hell', 'want', 'do', 'get', 'whole', 'concept', 'feeling', 'pressure', 'deciding', 'fate', 'God', 'do', 'need', 'drag', 'out', 'entire', 'episode', 'Should', 'been', 'less', '1/4', 'episode', 'discussing', 'fate.The', 'point', 'im', 'trying', 'make', 'here', 'TONS', 'stuff', 'can', 'pack', 'episode', 'want', 'drag', 'cast', 'staying', 'farm', 'so', 'long', 'least', 'have', 'explore', 'gather', 'go', 'missions', 'anything', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'Post', 'Apocalyptic', 'U.S', 'Congress', 'argueing', 'over', 'bill', 'month.Any', 'how', 'thought', 'ending', 'episode', 'was', 'descent', 'happend', 'once', 'felt', 'most', 'episode', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'boring', ""'ve"", 'had', 'exciting', 'episodes', ""was'nt"", 'one']",The Walking Dead: Season 2
