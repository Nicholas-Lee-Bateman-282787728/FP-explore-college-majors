This one is very good and very engaging. I am very happy to have ordered this. I have already ordered volume 2 and 3 of it. I can watch this with my one year old over and over again. She will grow up bilingual there is no question about it. But most of all my 8 year old enjoys watching this DVD as well. It is an amazing language DVD for kids. I highly recommend it. I speak Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi and Arabic besides English. This will be my fifth language learning experience and probably the best one. Good Luck!",5,Excellent DVD For Any Age!,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,621,"['was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'have', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Language', 'Tree', 'was', 'awful', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'engaging', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'have', 'ordered', 'have', 'already', 'ordered', 'volume', '2', '3', 'can', 'watch', 'one', 'year', 'old', 'over', 'again', 'will', 'grow', 'up', 'bilingual', 'question', 'most', '8', 'year', 'old', 'watching', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'amazing', 'language', 'DVD', 'kids', 'highly', 'recommend', 'speak', 'Urdu', 'Hindi', 'Punjabi', 'Arabic', 'English', 'will', 'be', 'fifth', 'language', 'learning', 'experience', 'probably', 'best', 'one', 'Good', 'Luck']",N/A

The animation reminds me of PBS.  It's obviously been released on VHS as instructions for pressing play, stop, etc. on a VCR are given.  The animation is also not computer generated so some children may be put off about it.  It reminds me of some of the PBS animated reading programs.  At least you don't have to worry about out-dated fashions.  It's just a cat in simple clothing.I am also a certified foreign language teacher Pre-K-12 and I am aware of what is out there for young children.  I think this is a good supplementary/support-type product, but I wouldn't rely on it alone to teach your child French.Of the products I viewed, I believe this one is the best for the younger children.  I'm not sure about the upper age range for the product, but I think you could use it with a child younger than 4.  I don't think you'd want to go lower than 2, especially with the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations about viewing for under age 2.In the segment that we viewed, we were introduced in English to the cat, Moustache and his parents.  Most of the dialogue was in English so I'm not sure how well this would work with a child who had a different primary language.  Each phrase was said 3 times with the sentence presented on the screen with it.I don't see any young child (2-6) sitting through the entire DVD without adult interaction.  As a teacher, I said the phrases with my daughter and even added some gestures, so I will admit all her attention was not on the DVD.  I think 5-10 minutes is the max you could expect.  Not a babysitting DVD.I'm looking for another program that has more action and play activities.  For preschoolers who want to learn Spanish, I still love Boca Beth, but there doesn't seem to be the French equivalent.  I believe Hop, Skip, and Jump in French would be a good alternative, but it's only currently available on CD format.  I wasn't thrilled with Beth Manners' French series.  They are repetitive and probably only one of them would suffice.  There are some French Canadian children's DVDs, but I don't recall the names of them.  Perhaps Amazon Canada has them.",5,Great for introductory French,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,2259,"['previewed', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'determine', 'wanted', 'purchase', 'other', '2', 'set.I', 'kept', 'mind', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'as', 'well', 'animation', 'PBS', 'obviously', 'been', 'released', 'VHS', 'instructions', 'pressing', 'play', 'stop', 'etc', 'VCR', 'are', 'given', 'animation', 'also', 'not', 'computer', 'generated', 'so', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'PBS', 'animated', 'reading', 'programs', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'out-dated', 'fashions', 'just', 'cat', 'simple', 'clothing.I', 'am', 'also', 'certified', 'foreign', 'language', 'teacher', 'Pre-K-12', 'am', 'aware', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'young', 'children', 'think', 'good', 'supplementary/support-type', 'product', 'would', ""n't"", 'rely', 'alone', 'teach', 'child', 'products', 'viewed', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'younger', 'children', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'upper', 'age', 'range', 'product', 'think', 'could', 'use', 'child', 'younger', '4', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'want', 'go', 'lower', '2', 'especially', 'American', 'Academy', 'Pediatrics', 'recommendations', 'viewing', 'age', '2.In', 'segment', 'viewed', 'were', 'introduced', 'English', 'cat', 'Moustache', 'parents', 'Most', 'dialogue', 'was', 'English', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'work', 'child', 'who', 'had', 'different', 'primary', 'language', 'phrase', 'was', 'said', '3', 'times', 'sentence', 'presented', 'screen', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'young', 'child', '2-6', 'sitting', 'entire', 'DVD', 'adult', 'interaction', 'teacher', 'said', 'phrases', 'daughter', 'even', 'added', 'gestures', 'will', 'admit', 'attention', 'was', 'not', 'DVD', 'think', '5-10', 'minutes', 'max', 'could', 'expect', 'Not', 'babysitting', 'DVD.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'program', 'more', 'action', 'play', 'activities', 'preschoolers', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'Spanish', 'still', 'love', 'Boca', 'Beth', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'French', 'equivalent', 'believe', 'Hop', 'Skip', 'Jump', 'French', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'alternative', 'only', 'currently', 'available', 'CD', 'format', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'Beth', 'Manners', 'French', 'series', 'are', 'repetitive', 'probably', 'only', 'one', 'would', 'suffice', 'are', 'French', 'Canadian', 'children', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'names', 'Perhaps', 'Amazon', 'Canada']",N/A
