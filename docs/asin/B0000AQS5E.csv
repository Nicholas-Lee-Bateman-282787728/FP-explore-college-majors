It is fun to watch after having seen the series...to see the many changes that occurred between the original movie and the series. It's especially fun to see the Walton kids grow up! Michael Learned started out as being a so-so replacement for Patricia Neal, who played the rough-edged but tough-loving mother in the movie. Patricia Neal was perfect for the part right from the start. It would take Michael Learned awhile to make it her own, which she achieved before very many episodes had passed, so my hat's off to her for doing a stupendous job in the series. Edgar Bergen was a sweet little ol' man who didn't make a very strong imprint on the movie. His replacement for the series--Will Geer--started out small but grew in the part as Grandpa in leaps and bounds. He and John Boy (Richard Thomas) would work extremely well as a team--each with a sparkle of life in his eye. Grandma was Grandma (Ellen Corby) in both the movie and series, God bless her! The father in the movie had a tiny but poignant and sensitive role. The series father (Ralph Waite) expanded on the sensitive aspect while adding a powerful dynamic to the series.

I was reminded of times in my own childhood when we waited for my dad to get home from work on Christmas Eve to complete the family unit, usually with an armload of presents he had gouged out of merchants he visited along the way at last-chance sale prices.  This program portrays some of the hardships that people living through the Depression endured.  However, one hardship I can't understand is why was the barn, which contained not only the cow but the family's firewood, located half a mile from the house?

They say she's too harsh in the role.If you can separate the film from the series (which came later) you can see what an amazing performance she gave.  In Patricia Neal's hands Olivia is a different character -- a strong, care-worn woman, battered by the times and poverty, but tough enough to endure all that life given her.  She is the heart and soul of this film, and captures the era and the earthiness of this character far more realistically than in the later series.Don't get me wrong -- Michael Learned was lovely and warm in her role and I love the show, but this wonderful little film is something different.

767380,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,B0000AQS5E,Classic film buff,"[3, 3]","Although I can remember seeing trailers on the CBS network before the December 19, 1971 air date, I didn't see ""The Homecoming: A Christmas Story"" until the following year after the spinoff television series ""The Waltons"" began it's lengthy run.  This made for television movie clicked with me, since I was already familiar with the characters from watching ""The Waltons"", and it is in my pantheon of favorite Christmas movies that I watch at least once during the holiday season.It's Christmas Eve 1933, on Walton's Mountain, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, a snowstorm is raging, and the entire Walton family is impatiently awaiting the return of its head, John Walton (Andrew Duggan).  With America still in the grip of the Great Depression, John like many others is forced to seek work away from his home.  He is travelling a considerable distance to spend Christmas with his family, which comprises his wife, seven children and his parents.  John is running very late in returning and his wife Olivia (Patricia Neal) is becoming worried.  On the radio, she overhears a possible reason for his delay; a bus that he might have been on has crashed, with several passengers taken to the hospital.  With no telephone in the house, all her in-laws and she can do is pray and wait, hoping for the best, trying to keep the news from the children.  As night closes in, an increasingly anxious Olivia hears a radio update that there has been at least one fatality from the accident, which decides her, she can no longer be passive, and she must act.  Summoning her oldest child, fifteen-year-old John-Boy (Richard Thomas), she tells him about the situation and then sends him out into the snow to try to see if he can locate his father in the borrowed car of a family friend Charlie Sneed (William Windom).The pivotal performances around which the story revolves are those of Patricia Neal as Olivia Walton and Richard Thomas as John-Boy Walton, they both are the heart and soul of the film.  Though not Ms. Neal's first USA film appearance after recovering from a series of near fatal strokes in 1965, I believe it was her network television comeback.  She was perfectly suited to the role of a rural Southern woman being born in Kentucky and raised in Tennessee.  One factor that motivated her to accept the role of Olivia Walton was that ""Olivia"" was the name of her oldest daughter who had died tragically of complications from measles in 1962 when she was only seven years old.  Ms. Neal wanted her performance to be her own tribute to her child and it was.  Her Olivia is a strong earth mother holding the family together in her husband's absence.  Though careworn and ravaged, her face has it's own kind of beauty, she may seem stern and implacable at times, but the loving nature is always there close to the surface.  The husky voice with its soft Southern cadences is richly expressive, all in all a lovely portrait, her daughter would have been proud.Most likely John-Boy Walton is the role for which Richard Thomas will be remembered, due to the popularity of the long running television series ""The Waltons"".  Aged nineteen when he filmed this, Thomas has an awkward grace reminiscent of the very young Jimmy Stewart.  He effortlessly captures the essence of this sensitive fifteen-year-old adolescent struggling to become a man his father will admire, while retaining his own individuality and dreams.The supporting cast is wonderful, starting with the six young actors who play John-Boy's siblings; they have a rustic look to them, and aren't cloying in the manner of some child actors.  All would be retained for the television series, and America got to see them grow up.  Ellen Corby played the crotchety old biddy Grandma Walton in both as well, but she was never one of my favorite characters.  As Grandpa Walton, Edgar Bergen was an improvement over Will Geer who played the role in the series, Bergen gave the character a dignity and gravity Geer lacked.  Better casting also was Dorothy Stickney and Josephine Hutchinson as the genteel bootlegging Baldwin sisters, they brought novel little quirks to the characters, making them much more amusing and interesting than the two actresses who played the same roles in the series.  The final cast members I want to applaud are Cleavon Little as the pragmatic, larger than life preacher Hawthorne Dooley who loves God but realizes a man has to feed his family as well, William Windom as the good-natured Robin Hood, Charlie Sneed, and last but not least Andrew Duggan as the rugged, hearty John Walton.As many probably know Earl Hamner Jr. who wrote the excellent screenplay, and also is the narrator at the teleplay's beginning and end is John-Boy grown up, the Waltons are based on his own family.  One of television's finest directors Fielder Cook and renowned composer Jerry Goldsmith with his evocative score made key contributions to the drama's success. This is beautifully photographed with the outdoor scenes filmed near Jackson's Hole, Wyoming, and evokes the rural atmostphere faithfully, the sets look comfortably worn and lived in, are not prettified with the exception of the elegant home of the Baldwin ladies.What draws me to this film is the strong feeling of family and just how important it is to life. Despite the hardships of poverty, the Waltons are able to love, respect and support one another even if they sometimes get on each other's nerves.  Also this is a nostalgic reminder of simpler, more innocent era when a family actually sat together to listen to the radio.  In these tough economic times, I think the viewer can get some solace and comfort as the Waltons endure and even thrive as individuals in the midst of the worst depression this country has ever experienced.  Finally, without being preachy or sanctimonious, the true spirit of Christmas shines through, this is a holiday treasure to savor.",5,"""The first miracle I want to see tonight is your daddy walking

I remembered having fond memories of this movie and seeing it around Christmas many times when I was young.When I saw it here on Amazon, I figured it was probably nostalgia and it would not be nearly as good as I remembered. Sometimes you watch an old movie and wonder ""Why did I think this was so good""? Not in this case. The movie, the story, the acting (where it counts), and the Christmas sentiment all hold up perfectly well in this made for TV movie. In some ways, its hard to believe the quality of a made for TV movie.The Homecoming was good enough to be thought of as the pilot of The Waltons even though it was never intended to be a pilot. But much of the cast did go on to act in The Waltons series based on the same Earl Hamner, Jr. book Spencer's Mountain which was also made into a movie years earlier. The Homecoming is a simple, touching tail of a family dealing with hard times. It can really put things into perspective when you see how different and tough life was during the depression. But the story never feels like its trying to be sad or pull at your heart strings. But it will. Of course in the end, like most Christmas movies, its very uplifting.After a viewing this year, there is no doubt in my mind that this belongs right up there with my other annual Christmas favorites, Miracle on 34th, Its a Wonderful Life, and the similarly titled but vastly different A Christmas Story (you'll shoot your eye out kid). And of course all the claymation classics. But you don't see this one run for 24 hours straight like some of those others.

The stories were based on Hamner's childhood.(Note: This movie features a somewhat different cast than did the series. While the Walton children are the same, many of the other adult roles in this film, except Grandma Walton played by the late Ellen Corby, were recast for the series.)A homespun tale, the movie focuses on rural life during the Great Depression and the anxiety a family feels one Christmas when their beloved Father is overdue after being forced to travel to the city to find work and earn money for his family's survival.Each of the characters reacts to his departure in different ways. Ultimately, the oldest son, John-Boy, portrayed by Richard Thomas, takes important steps to manhood and toward his ultimate career as a writer.This film has a harsher, more real feel than did the series, and tackles such difficult subjects as racial bigotry and the economic underclass.The great Patricia Neal is spectacular in her portrayal of the mother. Tougher than the portrayal that came later by the gifted Michael Learned, Neal's Olivia Walton is a genuine force of nature who rarely displays her softer side. Life is very difficult, but love is always present in the Walton home.If you've never seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to view a more unvarnished, less ""suburban"" rendition of life in this beloved family. A scene in which little Elizabeth, who desperately wants a doll for Christmas, receives one -- with a cracked and broken face -- from a ""charity"" Missionary only after having to ""perform"" scriptures, is so raw that it hurts. ""It's dead,"" the little girl sobs into her brother's comforting arms.This film is anything but dead. There is real life in every panel that reaffirms true family relationships and the Christmas spirit without being heavy-handed.

It was then and still is one of the best Christmas stories I have ever seen.  It's well written, exceptionally acted, dramatic and poignant, and above all for me personally, inspirational. (It gave me the idea of perhaps writing for a living, which I do indeed do). It was such a memorable and touching story that though I was happy to see it become ""The Waltons"", I have to admit that I was dubious of its chances for success.  So many times over the years a movie has inspired a TV series only see it fail miserably.  But of course anyone who has ever seen or heard of The Waltons knows that this was one glowing exception indeed.  It's wonderful to have this on DVD because for some reason it disappeared from television many years ago as a Christmastime staple.  I have watched this every Christmas on disc for the last half dozen years, (and even sneak a peak at it at other times), and it has lost nothing as to its magic and nostalgia for me.  I do believe that it could be just as popular today if it was to appear on TV again during the Christmas season as it was in the 70s...Not only do I highly recommend this to anyone that has ever seen or loved the Waltons, but I also feel that anyone that loves Christmas stories will be enthralled by this movie.  It is a beautiful tale that will touch you again and again with every new viewing.  One last thing I have to say about this story. With all the reality shows and violence that inundates television today, I can't help but feel how much this old time poignant story of love, warmth, and family values could really be of great worth today.  I have nothing against the action series and suggestive sitcoms that are so popular now.  I only feel bad that all of the family sitcoms and shows like ""Little House"" and ""Waltons"" have all but disappeared along side them.  Pardon me if I hold onto the hope and idea that sometime soon this beautiful story will be shown once again at some future Christmas time, and the whole genre of wholesome family entertainment will make an encore appearance.

The story of the Walton family's vigil for father John Walton, on his way home from work on an icy night with treacherous roads, has been detailed here, so no need to go further.The acting from every cast member is superb, although Edgar Bergen's Grandpa pales beside Will Geer's full-bodied portrayal of the role in the subsequent series. Patricia Neal presents us with a very different Olivia than the one in the series: a woman who has had to accept the burden of raising seven children in difficult economic times while her husband is away providing the money they live on. Richard Thomas shines as the oldest boy who feels he must live up to his father's image of him rather than follow what he wants to do in life. The kids act like real children, bickering, loving, playing. The supporting cast is also a treat, especially Cleavon Little as the struggling black minister and William Windom as Charley Snead, who just wants to help his neighbors.THE HOMECOMING has a grittier feeling than the later WALTONS series (especially later episodes); you really feel as if the family is struggling to make ends meet in the film. The set dressings make you feel as if you are actually in a 1930s mountain home. In addition, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful: shots of characters against backgrounds that become true works of art--the children silhoutted against the sky in the opening scenes, for example, or the sleighing scenes, or John-Boy framed by the moisture-dappled back door window. The score by Jerry Goldsmith accompanies the action wonderfully. This is a true Christmas treat.(Trivia: the Waltons have a time-travelling radio in this film, which takes place in 1933. The Fibber McGee and Molly series didn't start until 1935 and the episode they are listening to was broadcast in 1947. Does it matter to the film?

Sometimes, it's a shock to see another person in a role you know so well but that's not the case here.  In fact the whole cast did a splendid job.  The Homecoming was so well cast that all of the child actors remained in their roles for the televison program.  The roles of Ma, Pa and Grandpa Walton (played by Edgar Bergen)were recast along with the owner of the general store and the Baldwin sisters.  Grandma Walton (Ellen Corby) continued the in role even after suffering a stoke a few years later.  I give the producers high praise for not casting her aside like an old shoe.If you think a Christmas t.v. show should be heartwarming, then you can't go wrong here.  Set in the time of the depression, somewhere in the blue ridge mountains, lives a large family trying to make ends meet.  There will be homemade gifts for Christmas but the children don't really mind.  A far cry from kids of today.  Here, people still attend church, look after their neighbors, children mind their manners and don't talk back to elders.  It's the kind of place we older folks wish we could bring back, minus the lack of money of course.The family is in a bit of a turmoil as they wait for their dad to return home for Christmas.  Time passes but there is no sign of him.

The Walton family included the mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, and seven children; all living together in the home, much like life used to be. The setting centers around the family anxiously waiting for the father to come home from his job a good distance away.  Word of a bus accident with injuries and fatalities creates the concern. The children, on the other hand, are excited that it is Christmas Eve, and each has his or her wish for the perfect gift from Santa.This movie carefully and gently shows what life was like for families who struggled during those years, how little it took to bring joy and happiness, and most importantly how love of family is what carried them through those hard times.

Not having a lot, or everything you want, makes you appreciate what is really important in life, that is, family, friends, and relatives, good food and good conversation.The film paints an excellent picture of the fear that accompanies a missing family member, who is supposed to be home by now, but isn't, and with the weather so frightful, one can just imagine all of the serious trouble that they might be in.  Finally, the wait is so long, you send out the oldest boy to see if he can find his father.Patricia Neal, especially, is the center force of this movie.  She always seems to play a serious, determined woman with perhaps even an edge to her.  Richard Thomas plays John-Boy, as he did in the years following on the television drama ""The Waltons"".  He is also very good, as the other principle character.  His interaction with friends and relatives are very well done, including the very funny engagement with the Baldwin sisters and their potent libation is not to be missed.Highly recommended.

767451,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B0000AQS5E,Simon Davis,"[19, 21]","Nowadays what is not commonly know about the classic 1971 Christmas television movie ""The Homecoming: A Christmas Story"", is that it was not originally intended as the pilot episode for any series little alone the long running classic series ""The Waltons"", which did end up spinning off from it. Highly acclaimed with good reason at its premiere for Christmas 1971 this beautiful little movie was a regular feature in our Christmas television programming for many years before it strangely seemed to vanish off the tv scheduling lists along with many other wonderful Christmas themed offerings. Watching ""The Homecoming: A Christmas Story"", now of course makes most interesting comparitive viewing in the light of most viewers having become so used to ""The Waltons"", television series that ran for 9 seasons and that had different actors playing in many of the adult lead roles. This Christmas movie however needs to be viewed on it's own unique merits where it can be seen as a truly inspired piece of movie making from a seemingly simpler time that was perfect for then converting into an ongoing series as did actually happen. It also says alot about the high standards that were once an almost expected feature of these made for television movies. Thankfully now released on DVD in a superb restored print this touching but at times very realistic Christmas drama is now a treasured part of my annual Christmas viewing schedule.Set during the depression at Christmas 1933 ""The Homecoming"", centres on a poor rural family struggling like alot of the nation to survive another bleak winter. What the family lacks in resources they more than make up for in family togetherness and love so it is a bit wrench when father John (Andrew Duggan), must seek work out of the county to try and support his family. Expected home on Christmas Eve, wife Olivia (Patricia Neal), is alarmed to hear on the radio of a bus accident which might have had John on board. As the preparations for Christmas continue a number of other substories unfold including eldest son John Boy (Richard Thomas)revealing his dream of becoming a writer. Despite her fears for her husband's safety there is still a Christmas to prepare for and shopping to be done with little money and it is only when things begin to look very grim that Olivia sends out John Boy to search for his missing father. John Boy has many diverting adventures along the way including a memorable encounter with the two eccentric Baldwin Sisters (Dorothy Stickney and Josephine Hutchinson),who brew their own liquer and finally after entering a black church John Boy gets assistance from the miniser (Cleavon Little),who kindly leaves his family and congregation to help look for John. After all hope seems to be gone and a tree over the road stops John Boy from searching any further a miracle finally occurs and Olivia's private prayers are answered when John finally does arrive safely home bringing gifts for the family and the Waltons can finally settle down to enjoy a simple but very warm and loving Christmas together.""The Homecoming: A Christmas Story"", while laying the ground for what became so memorable about the ""The Waltons"", still certainly retains it's own look and character. Both in locations used, general environment and in how some of the characters are portrayed it is far removed from the later series. The standout in the cast is without a doubt the extremely talented Patricia Neal in the role of Olivia Walton. Not only is Olivia here an older woman than the character as performed in ""The Waltons"", by Michael Learned but she seems at times to be also made of sterner stuff and has a different type of rapport with the Walton children. Neal's Olivia however is the whole centre of this movie and she delivers a totally believable performance where she is forced to keep things as normal as possible during the families preparations for Christmas while she anxiously waits to hear what has actually happened to her husband John. As played by Andrew Duggan the role of John Walton, the firm but loving head of the Walton clan who was so often a pivotal character in the series, is reduced to simply a cameo role at the film's conclusion but that is correct as the story really belongs to the characters of Olivia and eldest son John Boy. Richard Thomas is still best known for his memorable portrayal of John Boy Walton and here we see that character still in it's infancy. Richard Thomas was always an incredibly sensitive actor and the role of John Boy fitted him like a glove. He has many very poignant moments in ""The Homecoming"", with the real standouts being his frenzied attempts to track down his missing father during bitterly cold Christmas weather and especially when he enters the black church during one of their services to seek help in his search from the minister. Sometimes the recasting of the roles for the ""The Waltons"", series was actually an improvements and that was certainly the case in the role of Grandpa Walton here played by Edgar Bergen. He somehow never seems to really capture the true essense of this grand old man like Will Geer did in the later series and is very much a supporting character in the main story line. Veteran actress Ellen Corby continued on in her role of Grandma but sadly here she is given little to do and it really was only in ""The Waltons"", series that these two memorable characters became the much loved and acclaimed roles they are still remembered as. ""The Homecoming: A Christmas Story"", is rich in some beautiful location photography in the Appalachian Mountians and indeed the whole look and atmosphere of this movie is very different from the series. Despite both movie and series being set in the depression ""The Homecoming"", seems to find the Waltons a much poorer family who are really struggling to make ends meet in a very remote area of Virginia. Period flavour is authentically recreated in every department and being of course the brain child of Earl Hamner Jr, upon whose life the movie was based, is right on target for a total recreation in costumes, cars, manners and in simple sincerity of what early 1930's Virginia was possibly like.Movies like ""The Homecoming: A Christmas Story"", deserve to be aired more often at Christmas than what they now are. Beautifully written with characters that seem totally real and who are simply trying to handle the everyday things that make up all of our existences, it has none of the flashy showbiz-like look and feel of many of our Christmas themed stories being made nowadays. Looking at it's fine dramatic qualities it is very easy to see why a highly successful TV series was created out of it that in its turn went on to entertain viewers for an amazing nine seasons on prime time television . For a dose of down to earth dramatic fare for Christmas without the expected tinsel you can't get better than the recreation of Earl Hamner's childhood Christmas in depression ridden 1933 in ""The Homecoming: A Christmas Story"".",5,Heartwarming Classic Christmas Television Movie,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,7009,"['Nowadays', 'what', 'not', 'commonly', 'know', 'classic', '1971', 'Christmas',

For nostalgia alone, I love this movie, but watching it as an adult, I am always struck by the depth of Patricia Neal's performance as Olivia Walton, and Richard Thomas as John Boy.  Also, I always loved Cleavon Little as Rev. Hawthorne Dooley (he died far too young).The only thing that ever bothered me about the movie is the hairstyles --the younger boys' are a little too 1970's.  Aside from that, I think the producers really caught something of the Depression era.This is a classic Christmas story, and a classic television presentation -- the kind of television that should be made, but just isn't anymore.  Just compare THE HOMECOMING with something of recent Christmas vintage, like, Drake & Josh's Christmas movie on Nickelodeon, and you will see how far standards have fallen.
