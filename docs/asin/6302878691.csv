The film is based on Jaime Escalante (James Edward Olmos), a financially successful man who trades his profession to teach school in L.A.  Not accepting failure, he earns the trust of his students whose cynicism is unmatched by everyone except the teachers.  Using colorful tactics, toughness, and humor, he wins his mostly hispanic classes by bridging the gap between what they can learn and what they've despaired of ever learning.  Using his own dedication to build confidence, he catalyzes his students to use the educational ticket out of despair and poverty.Comparing Olmos performance to real videos of Escalante, the actor hit the nail on the head.  All the young performers bring such likable and identifiable students that they make us forget the groundbreaking nature of ""The Sweat Hogs"" (from TV's 'Welcome Back Kotter').  Endearing from start to finish, the story and characters are especially lovable.  Even the hard-boiled shell of students like Angel are particularly charismatic.  (Lou Diamond Phillips became an overnight sensation for his performance here.)

343472,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302878691,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 10]","The `good teacher, bad school' sub-genre is rich with hard-nosed teachers taming disruptive classrooms.  You can't escape one of these films without the general stereotypes flooding onto every scene.  Some of these films are handled with enough care and freshness to give it some entertainment value.  Then, there are those films who just fail to deliver anything substantial.  `Stand and Deliver' is so generic, so vanilla, predictable and boring that it lays flat more than stands up.Almost all of these films open with `based on a true story', and one has to question why anyone would want to tell this same story over and over again.  I understand that good teachers are hard to come by, and so when one actually stands up and `delivers' on their promise of educating our youths then they are worthy of our true praise, but that is better suited for an Oprah segment and not a feature film.  I don't know how many times you can try and sell `tough guy persona softened by the earnest attention of a teacher' before the rest of the world gets tired of hearing it.  The fact that most of these films (2008's `The Class' being a rare and beautiful exception) rely so heavily on clear manipulation is just one of many drawbacks.Another huge problem with `Stand and Deliver' is that Edward James Olmos' performance is terrible.  He's so one note and unconvincing and unlikable and basically detracts from the film's manipulation to the point where the film itself becomes a rather sloppy and uneven exercise in `I don't care anymore'.The formulaic nature of the film is in full form here.  Every scene follows the next in total expectation, and the connective tissue between a lot of these scenes is missing enough to the point where most of this film's progressive nature is stilted by the roughness of it all.

It's a must-see for everyone, regardless of educational attainment or profession.This movie, based on the true story of math teacher Jaime Escalante and his Garfield High students, shows us how one man's uncompromising work ethic can inspire others to overcome the most difficult adversities. Edward James Olmos is perfect as Escalante, a man who does not settle for mediocrity and sets out to instill that same philosophy in his students. No easy task, because his class is composed entirely of inner-city Latinos who have been conditioned by their circumstances to believe that they will never amount to much. Typifying this mindset is Angel (Lou Diamond Phillips, in a brilliant performance), a troublemaker who spends his nights boozing and joyriding with wild abandon.But with trademark Latino fire, Escalante pushes, and pushes, and then pushes some more. He requires his students to come to school early and leave late. He takes away their weekends, and even their summer vacation. And by the time he's done, they're ready to take the Advanced Placement Calculus test.Rarely do we see a film based on actual events that inspires us so profoundly. It's just a shame that it's not as well-known as it should be. (Count the number of reviews submitted here.)Just an aside: Olmos's name is not often mentioned when the topic of conversation is Hollywood's greatest actors.

However, it works well for a motivational piece. If these Mexican American kids can do calculus, so can you. I'm a mathematician, and believe me, when I say this, calculus isn't as hard as people think. It's just a lot of algebra with some trigonometry and geometry thrown in; the only difference is new techniques at the outset of every problem, and the rest is just algebra. Nevertheless, calculus is a fascinating journey to be on, and it does open a world to anyone. As for the film, I found it kind of boring and limiting because I saw so little of math involved. In fact, it's pretty much nil save a few partially covered problems. It also portrayed so many ineffective teaching methods that it makes me laugh to this day. Lou Diamond Phillips is the only reason why Stand and Deliver keeps being revisited because he pretty much stole every scene he appeared in. In fact, he should have gotten an Oscar nomination, not Edward James Olmos whose looks have shockingly declined since his days of Miami Vice. Also, Stand and Deliver still has the best poster once again due to Lou Diamond Phillips. The soap operatic subplots kept getting in the way.

Unlike most of the teacher's we see in these films, his inspiration and charisma seem to be more of an extension of his personality than a false persona created by a script.  In fact, most of his scenes in front of the class seem almost ad-libbed-the way an actual teaching environment would operate.  While Lou Diamond Phillips is splashed across the cover, the credit for this film needs to be directed towards Olmos.While most recent films about teaching have focused upon the lack of control that teachers execute in the classroom (particularly in underprivileged neighborhoods), this film is about a teacher who is in absolute command of his students.

Even though there were problems in the world (like there always are) it was, somehow, a less jaded and more jubilant world. Great films, like Stand and Deliver, remind me of this. This is based on the true story of teacher Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos), a man who gave up a steady job in a successful company, to teach math to a group of young people that the world had decided were rejects and unteachable - high school students of predominantly Mexican/Mexican American background. Escalante encounters rough around the edges teens like Angel Guzman (Lou Diamond Phillips), a young thug who is actually incredibly bright, but has not been given the structure or discipline to really apply himself. Escalante sees the challenges as an opportunity to encourage his students to empower themselves, and to also challenge the White majority and the school district, as well as Garfield High School, where they attend classes - a school that is about to lose its accreditation, and is scaring teachers away with its reputation and behavior problems.Some have called Stand and Deliver the Rocky of school underdog films. I would prefer to put it all in a class of its own. The story and script has moments of great humor, giving Edward James Olmos a chance to showcase his comedic prowess and timing, genuine depth and a great cast of fresh faced, young actors and actresses, many of whom I haven't seen in other films - with the exception of Lou Diamond Phillips, who went on to star in La Bamba and other movies - a heartthrob of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

As a former teacher myself of high school kids from a similar background as the ones portrayed in this movie, I know firsthand that what Escalante achieved is not impossible but it's not quite so clean and simple as shown here, but is extremely hard grueling work that often entails breaking through a lot of the students' ingrained patterns and applying a lot of painstaking coercion. The director, Ramon Menendez, seems to present a fairly sanitized  and glib version that glosses over a lot of the underlying social problems that are endemic to the urban poor while sometimes relying on some stock movie cliches (the tough guy who's really a softie at heart, the big seemingly dumb lunk, etc.).In short, ""Stand and Deliver"" lacks the kind of rawness, grit and ballsiness that could've made it more than just another well-meaning, triumphant and feel-good movie.

343499,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302878691,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","In some parallel universe Edward James Olmos won the Oscar for this one. If you're looking for a movie where you can cheer your head off for the underdogs, STAND AND DELIVER's your huckleberry. I got mad love for this movie. And it's not only because I can relate, because the screenplay is accessible enough that any viewer can relate. The underdog premise is as irresistible as you can have it. The performances are uniformly excellent, and never mind that I'd never heard of most of the actors, before or since. But what astounds me most is that this story is adapted from true events. It so very much smacks of a fairy tale from the barrio.Edward James Olmos is so very good here, pretty unforgettable. Back in '88, he was mostly known for his role in MIAMI VICE. STAND AND DELIVER features an unrecognizable Olmos, the man having transformed himself unflatteringly into a paunchy, balding, hunched over figure. He fully inhabits the role of Jaime Escalante, a software company employee who leaves his lucrative career to teach computer science at embattled Garfield High in East L.A. But lack of funding deprives the class of computers, and so Escalante begins to teach his apathetic students the rudimentaries of mathematics. Escalante's passion for teaching and the way he looks out for his students are something to behold. He sees enough potential in his class of mostly rebellious kids from the barrio that he decides to teach them calculus. Feel free now to insert that proverb about teaching a man to fish...Not that Jaime Escalante is portrayed as a perfect saint. The consummate workaholic, he often neglects his family. In class, he doesn't shy from bullying his students when jokes and cajoling and props aren't getting the job done. The kids themselves aren't Disney cute, but they come off as real people. I have to say that Lou Diamond Phillips is compelling as the gangbanging, hairnet-wearing homeboy Angel. Only Escalante drops more funny lines than Angel.The film chronicles the kids' struggles to pick up calculus and Escalante's ferociousness and unflagging dedication and the developing bond between teacher and students, and you can't help but be inspired. The characters are well-realized; the story is honest and unsentimental. There's a sense of joy in watching Escalante apply his unorthodox teaching methods. There's the memorable scene in which he brings to class a chef's hat, apples, and a meat cleaver to demonstrate the concept of fractions. There's gratification in watching his class transform from remedial reprobates into confident mathematicians. The film really wanders into over-the-top fairy tale territory during the final act when the kids are accused of having cheated to pass the National A.P. Calculus exam. The kids are forced to retake the exam... and pass it again. I mentioned ""over-the-top fairy tale"" except that, of course, I'm reminded that these events absolutely, really happened. Remarkable. I couldn't stop laughing when the film revealed Angel the resident gangbanger's test score. And I was staggered - and you'll be, also - by the incredible stats shown during the closing credits.

In the film, a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up, in one year, to become calculus winners.There is a good backgroud article at:[...]that describes how the process took ten years, so that the original group of future-burger-flipping students were not the ones who passed the AP calculus exam.  Jaime Escalante (played by Edward James Olmos of ""Miami Vice"" fame) actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time, reaching back to the junior high school that fed Garfield High.The way that the movie was done, however, allows the viewers to see some of the decision-making processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them, especially their parents.Remarkably, at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under Escalante's leadership.  That's 400 fewer future employees for KFC and MacDonald's.  (As Escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student, ""So tough guys don't do math - tough guys deep fry chicken for a living?"")Eventually, it appears that the Education Establishment won out, driving the brilliant teacher out, and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future.The idea is great, that no student should be regarded as hopeless, and that all should be encouraged to try, but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows.",5,"Good Idea, altered for Artistic Purposes",1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,1566,"['great', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'altered', 'story', 'theatricality', 'film', 'group', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'difficulties', 'simple', 'fractions', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'one', 'year', 'become', 'calculus', 'winners.There', 'good', 'backgroud', 'article', '[', 'how', 'process', 'took', 'ten', 'years', 'original', 'group', 'future-burger-flipping', 'students', 'were', 'not', 'ones', 'who', 'passed', 'AP', 'calculus', 'exam', 'Jaime', 'Escalante', 'played', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'fame', 'actually', 'built', 'up', 'system', 'excellence', 'one', 'grade', 'time', 'reaching', 'back', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'fed', 'Garfield', 'High.The', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'however', 'viewers', 'see', 'decision-making', 'processes', 'students', 'went', 'understanding', 'could', 'achieve', 'did', 'have', 'chance', 'life', 'be', 'more', 'others', 'especially', 'parents.Remarkably', 'one', 'point', 'were', 'as', 'many', '400', 'students', 'enrolled', 'math', 'enrichment', 'classes', 'Escalante', 'leadership', '400', 'fewer', 'future', 'employees', 'KFC', 'MacDonald', 'Escalante', 'said', 'one', 'taunts', 'reluctant', 'student', 'So', 'tough', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'math', 'tough', 'guys', 'deep', 'fry', 'chicken', 'living', 'Eventually', 'Education', 'Establishment', 'won', 'out', 'driving', 'brilliant', 'teacher', 'sending', 'kids', 'back', 'guaranteed', 'failed', 'future.The', 'idea', 'great', 'student', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'hopeless', 'should', 'be', 'encouraged', 'try', 'obviously', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'involved', 'goal', 'movie']",N/A

The film argues for this more caring kind of educator. Each contrast suggests the inherent superiority of educators putting more than just their time into teaching their students; they must put in their hearts and souls as well.The story is told from a several perspectives. The primary perspective is that of Jaime Escalante, a man who leaves the private sector to teach public High School in Eastern Los Angeles. There are a couple of secondary perspectives told concurrently with that of Escalante.One is that of Angel, a troubled youth who is Escalante's most challenging student. Another is the ongoing romance between two of Escalante's other students: Lupe and Pedro. These differing perspectives serve as a narrative device in the film. The shifting back and forth between these story lines helps to break up the film into comprehensible segments within the linear whole. These alternate perspectives help build the viewer's affection for and interest in the students portrayed; while at the same time building the dramatic tension of the plot.All in all, Stand and Deliver is successful in its aims (namely advancing the argument that there are no &quot;uneducatable&quot; students) while remaining compellingly entertaining.In the late twentieth century movies supplanted literature as catalysts for social change. I believe that Stand and Deliver, as well as several other movies like it, have successfully moved education to the forefront as a national issue.

As much as any film ever made, STAND AND DELIVER does precisely that. Based on the true story of Jaime A. Escalante, the film toys, as most biopics do, with many of the details of Escalante's actual story, but it definitely gets at the heart of his story. The film implies that Escalante instantly began teaching college AP Calculus to his students, whereas in fact he had been teaching at Garfield High School for almost a decade. But timing aside, he is justly celebrated as one of America's best known educators, helping the students of largely Hispanic Garfield enjoy exceptional success in its math program.Despite the liberties the film takes in the story of Escalante's story, this is easily one of the great films about education ever made in the United States. It is also a deeply subversive film, because it essentially argues that race and class is not a genuine impediment to academic success. It demonstrates that kids from remarkably poor households can excel in school if given both the opportunity and a teacher who cares. The overall story in the film is simple: Jaime A. Escalante arrives at Garfield High School and begins to teach math. Against all odds, he finds students who turn out to be high achievers despite the obstacles placed against them. Most of the narrative focuses on his 1982 class, in which 18 students passed the AP Calculus exam, but 14 were asked to retake the exam following accusations of cheating. 12 of the 14 did and passed a second time.What makes this such a wonderfully rich film are the strong performances by the central characters. Edward James Olmos, who I have long considered one of the finest actors in America, won a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his performance as Escalante (he lost to Dustin Hoffman in RAIN MAN). The rest of the cast centers on the young actors who portray his 1982 class, the best-known being Lou Diamond Phillips. Most of the kids were and are unknowns (with a couple of exceptions), but all do a great job. But Olmos dominates the film, just as his Escalante dominates his class.By the way, fans of the Sci Fi Channel should notice not one but three familiar faces from staple shows from that network. Edward James Olmos has, of course, for the past three years starred in the critically acclaimed BATTLESTAR GALACTICA as Admiral Bill Adama. Fans of that show might, however, have missed in STAND AND DELIVER Olmos's real life son Bodie, here playing Escalante's young son. On BATTLESTAR he appears as the Viper pilot Hot Dog. The school principal is played by Carmen Argenziano, who is familiar to fans of STARGATE SG-1 as Samantha Carter's father, Jacob Carter.",5,A wonderful affirmation of both individual human worth and the value of knowledge,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2849,"['are', 'many', 'movies', 'television', 'series', 'set', 'high', 'schools', 'lamentably', 'few', 'celebrate', 'joy', 'learning', 'sense', 'empowerment', 'achievement', 'can', 'generate', 'As', 'much', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'STAND', 'AND', 'DELIVER', 'precisely', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'Jaime', 'A.', 'Escalante', 'film', 'toys', 'most', 'biopics', 'do', 'many', 'details', 'Escalante', 'actual', 'story', 'definitely', 'heart', 'story', 'film', 'implies', 'Escalante', 'instantly', 'began', 'teaching', 'college', 'AP', 'Calculus', 'students', 'whereas', 'fact', 'had', 'been', 'teaching', 'Garfield', 'High', 'School', 'almost', 'decade', 'timing', 'aside', 'justly', 'celebrated', 'one', 'America', 'best', 'known', 'educators', 'helping', 'students', 'largely', 'Hispanic', 'Garfield', 'enjoy', 'exceptional', 'success', 'math', 'liberties', 'film', 'story', 'Escalante', 'story', 'easily', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'education', 'ever', 'made', 'United', 'States', 'also', 'deeply', 'subversive', 'film', 'essentially', 'race', 'class', 'not', 'genuine', 'impediment', 'academic', 'success', 'kids', 'remarkably', 'poor', 'households', 'can', 'excel', 'school', 'given', 'opportunity', 'teacher', 'who', 'overall', 'story', 'film', 'simple', 'Jaime', 'A.', 'Escalante', 'Garfield', 'High', 'School', 'teach', 'math', 'odds', 'students', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'high', 'achievers', 'obstacles', 'placed', 'Most', 'narrative', 'focuses', '1982', 'class', '18', 'students', 'passed', 'AP', 'Calculus', 'exam', '14', 'were', 'asked', 'retake', 'exam', 'following', 'accusations', 'cheating', '12', '14', 'did', 'passed', 'second', 'such', 'wonderfully', 'rich', 'film', 'are', 'strong', 'performances', 'central', 'characters', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'who', 'have', 'long', 'considered', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'America', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'performance', 'Escalante', 'lost', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'RAIN', 'MAN', 'rest', 'cast', 'centers', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', '1982', 'class', 'best-known', 'being', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'Most', 'kids', 'were', 'are', 'unknowns', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'Olmos', 'film', 'just', 'Escalante', 'class.By', 'way', 'fans', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'should', 'notice', 'not', 'one', 'three', 'familiar', 'staple', 'shows', 'network', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'course', 'past', 'three', 'years', 'starred', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'Admiral', 'Bill', 'Adama', 'Fans', 'show', 'might', 'however', 'have', 'missed', 'STAND', 'AND', 'DELIVER', 'Olmos', 'real', 'life', 'son', 'Bodie', 'here', 'playing', 'Escalante', 'young', 'son', 'BATTLESTAR', 'Viper', 'pilot', 'Hot', 'Dog', 'school', 'principal', 'played', 'Carmen', 'Argenziano', 'who', 'familiar', 'fans', 'STARGATE', 'SG-1', 'Samantha', 'Carter', 'father', 'Jacob', 'Carter']",N/A

It's the story of a man who begins teaching at a high school in the slums of Los Angeles, expecting to teach Computer Science. When he arrives what he instead finds is that there is not computer department, and he's stuck teaching basic math to a bunch of social misfits. The beginning of this movie sets the stage wonderfully by showing us the kind of people who inhabit the city as he drives through it on the way to the first day of school. When he arrives at the school we see the students in their natural environment (and a rough one it is). What is a teacher to do?The protagonist of this awe-inspiring story (Jaime Escalante) is a wonderful example of what can happen when a person chooses to adapt to certain environments and NOT adapt to others. When he's given the task of educating a group of kids that includes some scary gang-member type looking kids, instead of acting like a teacher he acts tough right back (reminding them that they're in HIS domain). Yet, when he's brought into a room with the other teachers and school staff, he goes against the grain. When the school's head advisor tells the principle that everyone is doing their best, he immediately says that he's not. And when she tells the principle that Escalante is asking too much of his students, he boldly tells her that the students will rise to the expectations of their teacher.This alone makes the movie interesting. But what adds even more drama to situation is the fact that each and every student in the class Escalante teaches has their own peer pressures to deal with. Some students have unsavory friends who would laugh at their taking a class seriously. Some of the students have boyfriends or girlfriends who don't understand their sudden interest in school. And some of the students have to deal with parents who don't understand why their education should come before taking care of their own family.As the movie progresses Escalante announces to the board that he wants to teach Calculus to his best students, despite the fact that the students hadn't studied any of the prerequisites for the course. Naturally this requires them to study through their summer break, and then six days a week with extra hours!In any teen environment there is always peer pressure. But what happens when positive peer pressure conflicts with negative peer pressure? When our gang-member type Angel first starts the class he is hesitant to get involved because of his rough and tough friends. When Escalante singles him out however, the pressure of the teacher is greater than the pressure of his ""friends"". Over time this has a tremendous effect on him. Towards the end of the movie, he's riding with his friend and starts acting stupid, and gets his friend a traffic ticket. When the guy becomes angry with him and wants to fight, Angel just walks away. What does this say about him as a person? To me, it shows that whether he likes it or not, he no longer belongs with his old associates, he's now turning into a responsible individual.As I said before, at the outset of the movie Escalante is the one who is thrown into pressure groups. He could become just like the other teachers, or just become uncaring like the kids in his class were initially. What he does instead is nothing short of a miracle. He uses his understanding of human nature, and the natural tendency of people to work better when their thoughts are united to his advantage. His class becomes its own little world, a club for the elite, the strong and the brave. And early on, when one of the students refuses to take a test, the other students quickly turn against her and ridicule her. She then quickly becomes obedient and gets back to work (positive peer pressure was too much for her). The harder the students are pushed and the more is expected of them, the more they feel like a team (how can I forget the scene where a student says that the rest of the class will have a better chance of making it without him?).The driving force of the scholastic miracle (and this movie) is Escalante. As he himself said, if the students don't have the desire, he will give it to them. And that's exactly what he did. He MADE them want to succeed. He MADE them have the motivation to keep pushing and striving for higher and higher goals. Basically, he educated them on how to be successful and hard-working individuals. People who normally wouldn't have anything to do with each other (computer nerds, homeboys, and rockers) all were united by their desire to achieve and make themselves into something great. They pushed themselves harder than anyone had ever done in their lives, and when push came to shove, they were successful in every way. Every single student Escalante taught passed the exam for college credit. Every one. Motivation is a powerful thing, and sometimes if you don't already have it an extraordinary person can give it too you.Everyone should see this movie.",5,"It's not that they're stupid, they just don't know anything",1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,4975,"['Stand', 'deliver', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'teaching', 'high', 'school', 'slums', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'expecting', 'teach', 'Computer', 'Science', 'When', 'what', 'instead', 'not', 'computer', 'department', 'stuck', 'teaching', 'basic', 'math', 'bunch', 'social', 'misfits', 'beginning', 'movie', 'stage', 'wonderfully', 'showing', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'inhabit', 'city', 'way', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'When', 'school', 'see', 'students', 'natural', 'environment', 'rough', 'one', 'What', 'teacher', 'do', 'protagonist', 'awe-inspiring', 'story', 'Jaime', 'Escalante', 'wonderful', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'person', 'adapt', 'certain', 'environments', 'NOT', 'adapt', 'others', 'When', 'given', 'task', 'educating', 'group', 'kids', 'scary', 'gang-member', 'type', 'looking', 'kids', 'instead', 'acting', 'teacher', 'tough', 'right', 'back', 'reminding', ""'re"", 'HIS', 'domain', 'when', 'brought', 'room', 'other', 'teachers', 'school', 'staff', 'grain', 'When', 'school', 'head', 'advisor', 'principle', 'everyone', 'doing', 'best', 'immediately', 'not', 'when', 'principle', 'Escalante', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'students', 'boldly', 'students', 'will', 'rise', 'expectations', 'teacher.This', 'alone', 'movie', 'interesting', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'drama', 'situation', 'fact', 'student', 'class', 'Escalante', 'teaches', 'own', 'peer', 'pressures', 'deal', 'students', 'have', 'unsavory', 'friends', 'who', 'would', 'laugh', 'taking', 'class', 'seriously', 'students', 'have', 'boyfriends', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'sudden', 'interest', 'school', 'students', 'have', 'deal', 'parents', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'education', 'should', 'come', 'taking', 'care', 'own', 'family.As', 'movie', 'Escalante', 'announces', 'board', 'teach', 'Calculus', 'best', 'students', 'fact', 'students', 'had', ""n't"", 'studied', 'prerequisites', 'course', 'Naturally', 'study', 'summer', 'break', 'then', 'six', 'days', 'week', 'extra', 'hours', 'teen', 'environment', 'always', 'peer', 'pressure', 'what', 'when', 'positive', 'peer', 'pressure', 'negative', 'peer', 'pressure', 'When', 'gang-member', 'type', 'Angel', 'first', 'class', 'hesitant', 'get', 'involved', 'rough', 'tough', 'friends', 'When', 'Escalante', 'out', 'however', 'pressure', 'teacher', 'greater', 'pressure', 'friends', 'time', 'tremendous', 'effect', 'end', 'movie', 'riding', 'friend', 'acting', 'stupid', 'friend', 'traffic', 'ticket', 'When', 'guy', 'angry', 'fight', 'Angel', 'just', 'walks', 'away', 'What', 'say', 'about', 'person', 'not', 'no', 'longer', 'old', 'associates', 'now', 'turning', 'responsible', 'individual.As', 'said', 'outset', 'movie', 'Escalante', 'one', 'who', 'thrown', 'pressure', 'groups', 'could', 'become', 'just', 'other', 'teachers', 'just', 'become', 'uncaring', 'kids', 'class', 'were', 'initially', 'What', 'instead', 'nothing', 'short', 'miracle', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'natural', 'tendency', 'people', 'work', 'better', 'when', 'thoughts', 'are', 'united', 'advantage', 'class', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'club', 'elite', 'strong', 'brave', 'early', 'when', 'one', 'students', 'take', 'test', 'other', 'students', 'quickly', 'turn', 'ridicule', 'then', 'quickly', 'obedient', 'back', 'work', 'positive', 'peer', 'pressure', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'harder', 'students', 'are', 'pushed', 'more', 'expected', 'more', 'feel', 'team', 'how', 'can', 'forget', 'scene', 'where', 'student', 'rest', 'class', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'chance', 'making', '.The', 'driving', 'force', 'scholastic', 'miracle', 'movie', 'Escalante', 'said', 'students', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'desire', 'will', 'give', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'MADE', 'want', 'succeed', 'MADE', 'have', 'motivation', 'keep', 'pushing', 'striving', 'higher', 'higher', 'goals', 'Basically', 'educated', 'how', 'be', 'successful', 'hard-working', 'individuals', 'People', 'who', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'other', 'computer', 'nerds', 'homeboys', 'rockers', 'were', 'united', 'desire', 'achieve', 'make', 'something', 'great', 'pushed', 'harder', 'anyone', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'lives', 'when', 'push', 'came', 'shove', 'were', 'successful', 'way', 'single', 'student', 'Escalante', 'taught', 'passed', 'exam', 'college', 'credit', 'one', 'Motivation', 'powerful', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'person', 'can', 'give', 'too', 'you.Everyone', 'should', 'see', 'movie']",N/A

343532,A3KLC5M7K1C5FJ,6302878691,Vato-Curandero,"[5, 5]","Stand and Deliver is an extremely inspiring story, based off of real events. In the late 1970s, Garfield High School in East Los Angeles had one of the highest rates of violence, gangs, and drop outs of any high school in the nation. Mathematical genius Jaime Escalante, an immigrant from Bolivia, joins Garfield's faculty as a mathematics teacher. Escalante discovers that his students have difficulty with fractions, but instead of giving up on them, Escalante pushes his students to succeed, instills confidence in them, and most important of all, never loses faith in his students. In six years (two in the movie), Escalante performs a 180 with students' performace and Garfield produces its first wave of annual advanced placement calculus achievers.The premise might sound dull on paper, but the film is a success based in large part on Edward James Olmos's exceptional performance as Escalante. This is easily the greatest performance Olmos has ever given in a film, and he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for his efforts. A young Andy Garcia makes a cameo appearance as a member of the AP exam board. Lou Diamond Phillips turns in a pretty good performance as a youth torn between maintaining the respect of his peers through his cholo persona on one hand, and walking the straight and narrow on the other. The rest of the cast is largely unknown, but turn in stellar performances as well.The movie is a true story and chronicles Garfield's mathematical renaissance under Olmos, but the film contains social commentary as well. Stand and Deliver criticizes the tendency to simply ""write off"" and ""give up"" on ""disadvantaged kids"" by assuming that they are past the point of no return. Another important message in Stand and Deliver is the value of having a positive role model in the classroom who truly cares for the students and has a vested interest in their success.My only complaints with the DVD are two-fold. First, the movie is presented in full-screen format which results in the cropping of the original filmwork in order to fit the screen. Secondly, the movie contains absolutely no extra features, not even a trailer. A short documentary on Eslante's life and/or on Garfield's dramatic turnaround would have been a fitting tribute on this disc.",4,Great movie with a great message,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,2270,"['Stand', 'Deliver', 'extremely', 'inspiring', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'late', '1970s', 'Garfield', 'High', 'School', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'had', 'one', 'highest', 'rates', 'violence', 'gangs', 'drop', 'outs', 'high', 'school', 'nation', 'Mathematical', 'genius', 'Jaime', 'Escalante', 'immigrant', 'Bolivia', 'Garfield', 'faculty', 'mathematics', 'teacher', 'Escalante', 'students', 'have', 'difficulty', 'fractions', 'instead', 'giving', 'up', 'Escalante', 'students', 'succeed', 'instills', 'confidence', 'most', 'important', 'never', 'faith', 'students', 'six', 'years', 'two', 'movie', 'Escalante', '180', 'students', 'performace', 'Garfield', 'first', 'wave', 'annual', 'advanced', 'placement', 'calculus', 'achievers.The', 'premise', 'might', 'sound', 'dull', 'paper', 'film', 'success', 'based', 'large', 'part', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'Escalante', 'easily', 'greatest', 'performance', 'Olmos', 'ever', 'given', 'film', 'was', 'rewarded', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'efforts', 'young', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'member', 'AP', 'exam', 'board', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'pretty', 'good', 'performance', 'youth', 'torn', 'maintaining', 'respect', 'peers', 'cholo', 'persona', 'one', 'hand', 'walking', 'straight', 'narrow', 'other', 'rest', 'cast', 'largely', 'unknown', 'turn', 'stellar', 'performances', 'well.The', 'movie', 'true', 'story', 'chronicles', 'Garfield', 'mathematical', 'renaissance', 'Olmos', 'film', 'social', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'tendency', 'simply', 'write', 'off', 'give', 'up', 'disadvantaged', 'kids', 'assuming', 'are', 'point', 'return', 'important', 'message', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'value', 'having', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'classroom', 'who', 'cares', 'students', 'vested', 'interest', 'success.My', 'only', 'DVD', 'are', 'two-fold', 'First', 'movie', 'presented', 'full-screen', 'format', 'results', 'cropping', 'original', 'filmwork', 'order', 'fit', 'screen', 'Secondly', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'extra', 'features', 'not', 'even', 'trailer', 'short', 'documentary', 'Eslante', 'life', 'and/or', 'Garfield', 'dramatic', 'turnaround', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'disc']",N/A
