Bush, 1984-1992 Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode, another political brother, must have disappointed the heck out of city electorate who hoped he'd put predecessor Frank Rizzo's bellicose style of government in the past.  Am I going too far in saying that, as the 2013 documentary LET THE FIRE BURN recalls, Wilson Goode bombed?Tonight I viewed LET THE FIRE BURN on a movie streaming service that described it as being about ""the fiery and ultimately tragic 1985 standoff between the extremist group MOVE and Philadelphia authorities.""  See LET THE FIRE BURN and tell me to whom the adjective ""extremist"" is more appropriate, Mayor Goode and the Philadelphia Police Department, or the eleven MOVE members - including five children - who died in that standoff about 29 years ago to the day as I write this in May 2014.I tip my hat the LET THE FIRE BURN filmmakers, who tell the story strictly through footage of television news coverage on MOVE from the 1970s and `80s as well as films of the public hearing on the May 14, 1985, tragedy.  The narration is this footage; there is no voiceover, nor are there new interviews with anyone who was there.Wilson Goode won a second term as Philadelphia mayor despite the blight of those five children killed by his police department.

1688100,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00HEM9QJI,Paul Allaer,"[10, 10]","&#34;Let The Fire Burn&#34; (2013 release; 95 min.) is a documentary about the fateful events of May 13, 1985 in West Philadelphia. The documentary opens with a brief glimpse of the raging fire on that day, and then the start of the public investigation hearings 5 months later. The documentary traces back to the early days of the radical MOVE group, founded in 1972 by John Africa as a &#34;back to earth&#34; movement but in reality being an all-out radical group which always was the &#34;victim of society&#34;. The documentary is divided into 6 chapters and an epilogue, and consists entirely of archive footage (mostly from TV) from the 70s and 80s.Several comments: I was aware of the terrible events from May, 1985 but really didn't know much about the MOVE group. This documentary does a great job filling in the gaps, and for that reason alone this is a worthwhile movie to watch. Second, you can't help but feel terrible for the young Michael (I think he is 13 years old) whom we see being deposed some months after the events. At one point he admits he wanted to flee so that he could do &#34;what the other kids were doing&#34; (i.e. playing in the streets, etc.). Third, the documentary becomes a great time capsule of what (urban) life was like in the late 70s and early 80s, it seems already so much longer ago than just the 30-some years ago. Fourth, regardless of how you feel about the politics of the MOVE group (and I certainly wouldn't call myself in agreement with them--on the contrary), the plain stupidity and negligence of the decision makers and powers that be (the mayor, the police chief, the fire chief) to let the fire burn to the point where it became out of control, is just appalling. Be sure to stick around for the epilogue as we learn what became of the main characters in this tragedy in subsequent years. Last but not least, this documentary is produced and directed by Jason Osder, an Assistant Professor at George Washington University, my (graduate) alma mater (GW seems to have been one of the co-producers).&#34;Let The Fire Burn&#34; is another one of those documentaries that are as eye-opening as they are riveting and ultimately entertaining (in the sense that time just flew by as you're watching it), not unlike, say, &#34;The Central Park Five&#34; or &#34;West of Memphis&#34;. This movie opened last month without any pre-release hype or fanfare at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. Even though I went to see it the first day it was playing, I had a semi-private showing (as in: there were only 3 people in the theatre, including myself). Regardless, if you like documentaries, you cannot go wrong with this and I'd suggest you seek this out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray. &#34;Let The Fire Burn&#34; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",4,4.5 stars...

1688101,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00HEM9QJI,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 2]","Having lived in Philadelphia for over 45 years, I lived through the various &#8220;confrontations&#8221; that the police and neighbors had with the MOVE &#8220;organization&#8221; over the years. MOVE members, past and present, resent having it called a &#8220;cult&#8221;; it&#8217;s an &#8220;organization&#8221;. It was the prime story on all three local TV stations in the 1970s when the group was house in the Powelton Village section of Philly and in 1985 when the MOVE headquarters on Osage Avenue was, literally, bombed and the whole block was destroyed.  It&#8217;s been nearly 30 years since that last event and it came back to local news in September 2013 when the sole surviving child from the bombing, Birdie Africa (whose real name is Michael Ward) died at age 41 &#8211; leaving 2 sons). This well-crafted documentary &#8211;directed by filmmaker Jason Osder and produced at the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs -  was completed and released to theaters and film festivals before Ward&#8217;s death and the DVD version contains some special features that add to the story.I won&#8217;t go into much detail about the event or the film. My fellow reviewer &#8211;Paul Allaer - has done that already. I will point out that Osder used only archival footage to hell the story in 95 minutes. What holds this all together is footage of the public hearings held at the studios of public broadcasting station WHYY which aired in Philadelphia. Nearly every person important to the story &#8211; the police and fire commissioners, the district attorney and two former MOVE members &#8211; were interviewed at these hearings. Osder adds titles and captions and music. The rest is all &#8220;found footage&#8221; from the three TV stations&#8217; archives.There are three bonus features.  The most important one is a 14 minute interview with Michael Ward from 2002. It has never been available before and helps us understand his feelings and how life changed when he went to live with his father (who was not a MOVE member and had been living in Europe).  For anyone who saw the film before this DVD release, this added material is worth watching.The second bonus is a Q&A; with director Osder recorded in 2013 at a screening in Troy, NY. (As I write this in March 2014, I learned that there will be similar screening and Q&A; with Osder at WHYY her in Philly.) This runs for 41 minutes and it could have used a bit of editing. Much of the time is used by hearing comments (not questions) from audience members, many who never heard of MOVE. While some of the information that Osder provides is useful, he is not a good public speaker and does not hold your attention. Yes, he&#8217;s a brilliant filmmaker and he speaks with his film editing. But I can&#8217;t say that the 41 minutes is worth your time. (It&#8217;s a bonus, so no stars are deducted in the rating.)This is a film that anyone who lived, or lives, in the Greater Philadelphia region need to see. For those elsewhere who have an interest in race relations in big northern cities or in the &#8220;cult mentality&#8221;, I think you&#8217;ll find this film worth seeking out,.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Review of the DVD with concentration on the Bonus Features-,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,3276,"['Having', 'lived', 'Philadelphia', '45', 'years', 'lived', 'various', '8220', 'confrontations', '8221', 'police', 'neighbors', 'had', 'MOVE', '8220', 'organization', '8221', 'years', 'MOVE', 'members', 'past', 'present', 'resent', 'having', 'called', '8220', 'cult', '8221', '8217', '8220', 'organization', '8221', 'was', 'prime', 'story', 'three', 'local', 'TV', 'stations', '1970s', 'when', 'group', 'was', 'house', 'Powelton', 'Village', 'section', 'Philly', '1985', 'when', 'MOVE', 'headquarters', 'Osage', 'Avenue', 'was', 'literally', 'bombed', 'whole', 'block', 'was', 'destroyed', '8217', 'been', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'last', 'event', 'came', 'back', 'local', 'news', 'September', '2013', 'when', 'sole', 'surviving', 'child', 'bombing', 'Birdie', 'Africa', 'real', 'name', 'Michael', 'Ward', 'died', 'age', '41', '8211', 'leaving', '2', 'sons', 'well-crafted', 'documentary', '8211', 'directed', 'filmmaker', 'Jason', 'Osder', 'produced', 'George', 'Washington', 'University', 'School', 'Media', 'Public', 'Affairs', 'was', 'completed', 'released', 'theaters', 'film', 'festivals', 'Ward', '8217', 'death', 'DVD', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'add', 'story.I', 'won', '8217', 'go', 'much', 'detail', 'event', 'film', 'fellow', 'reviewer', '8211', 'Paul', 'Allaer', 'done', 'already', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'Osder', 'used', 'only', 'archival', 'footage', 'hell', 'story', '95', 'minutes', 'What', 'together', 'footage', 'public', 'hearings', 'held', 'studios', 'public', 'broadcasting', 'station', 'WHYY', 'aired', 'Philadelphia', 'Nearly', 'person', 'important', 'story', '8211', 'police', 'fire', 'commissioners', 'district', 'attorney', 'two', 'former', 'MOVE', 'members', '8211', 'were', 'interviewed', 'hearings', 'Osder', 'titles', 'captions', 'music', 'rest', '8220', 'found', 'footage', '8221', 'three', 'TV', 'stations', '8217', 'are', 'three', 'bonus', 'features', 'most', 'important', 'one', '14', 'minute', 'interview', 'Michael', 'Ward', '2002', 'never', 'been', 'available', 'before', 'understand', 'feelings', 'how', 'life', 'changed', 'when', 'went', 'live', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'MOVE', 'member', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'Europe', 'anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'DVD', 'release', 'added', 'material', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'second', 'bonus', 'Q', 'A', 'director', 'Osder', 'recorded', '2013', 'screening', 'Troy', 'NY', 'write', 'March', '2014', 'learned', 'will', 'be', 'similar', 'screening', 'Q', 'A', 'Osder', 'WHYY', 'Philly', '41', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'editing', 'Much', 'time', 'used', 'hearing', 'comments', 'not', 'questions', 'audience', 'members', 'many', 'who', 'never', 'heard', 'MOVE', 'information', 'Osder', 'useful', 'not', 'good', 'public', 'speaker', 'not', 'hold', 'attention', 'Yes', '8217', 's', 'brilliant', 'filmmaker', 'film', 'editing', 'can', '8217', 't', 'say', '41', 'minutes', 'time', '8217', 's', 'bonus', 'stars', 'are', 'deducted', 'rating', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'lives', 'Greater', 'Philadelphia', 'region', 'need', 'see', 'elsewhere', 'who', 'have', 'interest', 'race', 'relations', 'big', 'northern', 'cities', '8220', 'cult', 'mentality', '8221', 'think', '8217', 'find', 'film', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', '.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",N/A
1688102,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00HEM9QJI,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[0, 0]","This film centers on the relationship of the unorthodox MOVE organization (We are not a cult!) and the city of Philadelphia, both the authorities and neighbors. It uses a community hearing and testimony from one of the child members as the main source plus actual film footage. MOVE supplied re-enactments when needed.The first question posed by the film was are they a cult or an organization? When everyone in the group adopts the surname of the founder and they all proclaim they are following the &#34;strategy of John Africa&#34; what you have is a cult no matter how many times you call it an organization.The second question posed was are they a terrorist group or an organization. I assume they believed everyone would come to the conclusion they were an organization because John Africa claimed they were an organization.The movie had actual recordings of the MOVE organization shouting f-bombs and MF-bombs through a megaphone into a residential area street where children play. Can't say I would want them as a neighbor. The fact that it took the city to burn down their house before the neighbors did turned out to be the biggest mystery of the film.Rule of thumb: When the government shows up at your door heavily armed (or with a tank like Waco) that is not the time to decide you are within your right to stay put, whether you are or not. You can make your argument later, file a civil rights suit etc. Now if you believe you can't win in court because the system is stacked against you, and you would rather take your odds against a tank, go ahead be my guest because you really don't belong in the gene pool anyway.I had sympathized with the MOVE organization believing they were a quiet peaceful counter culture group, but the film demonstrated they were simply masquerading.Was is a tragedy? Yes. Could the city of Philadelphia handled it better? Yes. But MOVE refused to obey lawful orders and as such must also bare some responsibility for the tragedy, which the film seems to want to ignore.Parental Guide: F-bombs, MF bombs and naked children courtesy of MOVE.",3,"THE STRATEGY OF JOHN AFRICA,",1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,2083,"['film', 'centers', 'relationship', 'unorthodox', 'MOVE', 'organization', 'are', 'not', 'cult', 'city', 'Philadelphia', 'authorities', 'neighbors', 'community', 'hearing', 'testimony', 'one', 'child', 'members', 'main', 'source', 'actual', 'film', 'footage', 'MOVE', 'supplied', 're-enactments', 'when', 'needed.The', 'first', 'question', 'posed', 'film', 'was', 'are', 'cult', 'organization', 'When', 'everyone', 'group', 'surname', 'founder', 'proclaim', 'are', 'following', '34', 'strategy', 'John', 'Africa', '34', 'what', 'have', 'cult', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'call', 'organization.The', 'second', 'question', 'posed', 'was', 'are', 'terrorist', 'group', 'organization', 'assume', 'believed', 'everyone', 'would', 'come', 'conclusion', 'were', 'organization', 'John', 'Africa', 'claimed', 'were', 'organization.The', 'movie', 'had', 'actual', 'recordings', 'MOVE', 'organization', 'shouting', 'f-bombs', 'MF-bombs', 'megaphone', 'residential', 'area', 'street', 'where', 'children', 'play', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'want', 'neighbor', 'fact', 'took', 'city', 'burn', 'down', 'house', 'neighbors', 'did', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'film.Rule', 'thumb', 'When', 'government', 'up', 'door', 'heavily', 'armed', 'tank', 'Waco', 'not', 'time', 'decide', 'are', 'right', 'stay', 'put', 'are', 'not', 'can', 'make', 'argument', 'later', 'file', 'civil', 'rights', 'suit', 'etc', 'Now', 'believe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'court', 'system', 'stacked', 'would', 'rather', 'take', 'odds', 'tank', 'go', 'ahead', 'be', 'guest', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'gene', 'pool', 'anyway.I', 'had', 'sympathized', 'MOVE', 'organization', 'believing', 'were', 'quiet', 'peaceful', 'counter', 'culture', 'group', 'film', 'demonstrated', 'were', 'simply', 'masquerading.Was', 'tragedy', 'Yes', 'Could', 'city', 'Philadelphia', 'handled', 'better', 'Yes', 'MOVE', 'refused', 'obey', 'lawful', 'orders', 'such', 'must', 'also', 'bare', 'responsibility', 'tragedy', 'film', 'want', 'ignore.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bombs', 'MF', 'bombs', 'naked', 'children', 'courtesy', 'MOVE']",N/A
