1404635,AV30RYVPJJJ34,B004EV6AHS,Alexander Stephen Brown,"[1, 1]","First off, I wont ramble on about the synopsis of this movie as you are here by one of three sources, Amazon recommended it, you saw a trailer for it on YouTube, or you heard about it by word of mouth. I have been following this movie since IMDB said that Cassandra Peterson (Elvria) was going to be in it and have been dying to see it since. If you want a synopsis just scroll up on this screen, the info that Amazon provided is right on the nail.While watching this modern cult masterpiece I felt completely astonished and ecstatic to know that someone still understood what it took to make a great camp black comedy.  To this I have to say the writer/director, Joshua Grannell AKA Peaches Christ is an amazing talent that proves his/her brilliance by not only screenwriting and acting but directing.From start to finish I loved this movie, it had the right amount of camp, comedy and horror to fill the complete feature.  My only complaint was I hated for the movie to end! In all of my years of being a movie buff, age 5 to current age 27, this has got to be the best contemporary horror comedy in ages.  The last time I remember being so blown away by a movie was when I saw Pink Flamingos for the first time, which was 10 years back.  While I am praising Peaches Christ I have to note that his/her style, is a nice mixture of classic John Waters, Herschell Gordon, Lewis, William Castle, etc.Peaches, the horror gay community needs you.  There are tons of gay/lesbian/bi/transgendered people out there who love horror and camp.  Until you graced us with your full length feature masterpiece we only had John Waters and few other names to cling to.  I honestly believe you can do for my generation and the upcoming generation what the ""Dreamlanders"" did for so many cult followers in the 70's.Finally, I would like to note that for some reason, Amazon doesn't have a stock of this movie. I'm not sure why but the individual seller that provides the movie through Amazon is actually the real Peaches Christ.  I am noting this because I know some people are hesitant in purchasing from an individual seller, however, I purchased my copy through Peaches via Amazon and was happy to note that the seller acted with speedy and prompt service.  When I received the DVD, it was factory sealed and in perfect condition, so don't be afraid to order from the seller on this page.Keep up the good battle Peaches! You have gained a hardcore fan in Mississippi! Thank you for entertaining the world with this movie filled with not only great laughs and gore but a great cast of amazing actors and actresses.",5,All Hail Queen Peaches!,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,2599,"['First', 'wont', 'ramble', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'are', 'here', 'one', 'three', 'sources', 'Amazon', 'recommended', 'saw', 'trailer', 'YouTube', 'heard', 'word', 'mouth', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'movie', 'IMDB', 'said', 'Cassandra', 'Peterson', 'Elvria', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'dying', 'see', 'want', 'synopsis', 'just', 'scroll', 'up', 'screen', 'info', 'Amazon', 'provided', 'right', 'nail.While', 'watching', 'modern', 'cult', 'masterpiece', 'felt', 'completely', 'astonished', 'ecstatic', 'know', 'someone', 'still', 'understood', 'what', 'took', 'make', 'great', 'camp', 'black', 'comedy', 'have', 'say', 'writer/director', 'Joshua', 'Grannell', 'AKA', 'Peaches', 'Christ', 'amazing', 'talent', 'his/her', 'brilliance', 'not', 'only', 'screenwriting', 'acting', 'directing.From', 'start', 'finish', 'loved', 'movie', 'had', 'right', 'amount', 'camp', 'comedy', 'horror', 'fill', 'complete', 'feature', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'hated', 'movie', 'end', 'years', 'being', 'movie', 'buff', 'age', '5', 'current', 'age', '27', 'got', 'be', 'best', 'contemporary', 'horror', 'comedy', 'ages', 'last', 'time', 'remember', 'being', 'so', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'saw', 'Pink', 'Flamingos', 'first', 'time', 'was', '10', 'years', 'back', 'am', 'praising', 'Peaches', 'Christ', 'have', 'note', 'his/her', 'style', 'nice', 'mixture', 'classic', 'John', 'Waters', 'Herschell', 'Gordon', 'Lewis', 'William', 'Castle', 'etc.Peaches', 'horror', 'gay', 'community', 'are', 'tons', 'gay/lesbian/bi/transgendered', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'horror', 'camp', 'graced', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'masterpiece', 'only', 'had', 'John', 'Waters', 'few', 'other', 'names', 'cling', 'honestly', 'believe', 'can', 'do', 'generation', 'upcoming', 'generation', 'what', 'Dreamlanders', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'cult', 'followers', ""70's.Finally"", 'would', 'like', 'note', 'reason', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'have', 'stock', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'individual', 'seller', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'actually', 'real', 'Peaches', 'Christ', 'am', 'noting', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'hesitant', 'purchasing', 'individual', 'seller', 'however', 'purchased', 'copy', 'Peaches', 'Amazon', 'was', 'happy', 'note', 'seller', 'acted', 'speedy', 'prompt', 'service', 'When', 'received', 'DVD', 'was', 'factory', 'sealed', 'perfect', 'condition', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'order', 'seller', 'page.Keep', 'good', 'battle', 'Peaches', 'have', 'gained', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'Mississippi', 'Thank', 'entertaining', 'world', 'movie', 'filled', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'laughs', 'gore', 'great', 'cast', 'amazing', 'actors', 'actresses']",All About Evil DVD - Unrated Collector's Edition
1404636,A1DURK17MGKBEB,B004EV6AHS,Ben Wasden,"[6, 6]","A lot of people have been complaining for quite a while about the lack of new original movies. All of those people need to check out All About Evil ASAP. It is a new horror movie, and it is one of a kind and 100% original. It is also very clever, funny, bloody, and well-acted. It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last year. And just look at that cast! Natasha Lyonne stars and gives an unhinged performance that would be nominated for an Oscar, if the Oscars didn't suck. Then there's old pros Mink Stole and Cassandra Peterson (aka Elvira), who both actually have a decent amount of screen time. Noah Segan is hilarious as a psychotic bum. And Thomas Dekker gives a good performance as our hero. And he is so cute and definitely marriage material! See All About Evil!

It's not Stephen Spielberg; it's not touchy-feely; it's not subtle; and it's not dark and mysterious.What it is, though, is a wild, tongue-in-cheek, faaaaabulous homage to those really, really bad slasher movies that somehow get financing and a distribution deal.  The whole thing plays like an inside joke, only you're in on it.  If the movie strikes you at first as awful, realize that the awfulness is on purpose.  If it seems way over the top and, frankly, totally unbelievable, even for a horror movie, keep in mind that the movie-makers intended it to be that way.I knew absolutely nothing about this movie or the people who made it, but I learned that the woman who plays the ""Elvira"" character was in it.  Cassandra Peterson has starred in a couple of spoofy comedy movies as ""Elvira"" and I enjoyed their campy-ness, as well as Ms. Peterson's adorable, stand-out personality and talent as a comedic actress.In this movie, Ms. Peterson plays a concerned mother of a teenage boy.  The ""Elvira"" costume, wig, and makeup are gone.  She plays the role straight--i.e., no buffoonery or hamming it up.  And even though she isn't using comedy to ""act,"" her skills as a dramatic actress shine and are just as fascinating to watch.  She isn't given a lot of screen time, but that's okay because her brief appearance lends a spark of credibility to the motion picture.It's also deliciously ironic that Ms. Peterson does not appear in ""drag"" as Elvira because there is so much drag in the rest of the movie.  The man who directed the film also stars in it as a female -- a big, overly exaggerated version of a female, to be precise.  And there are plenty of other eye-popping, alternative characters to prompt the casual viewer to wonder, ""What the heck am I looking at?""  Yet, despite how some of these aspects in other movies might turn off some viewers, this film manages to stay just this side of the line of not too bizarre for mainstream audiences.The EXTRAS on the DVD explain everything -- who the director is, how he brought the film to fruition, and how he (Joshua Grannell) as a she (Peaches Christ) obtained such a huge cult following by appearing in movie theaters to host showings of really, really bad horror films.The quality of the DVD audio and video is excellent.
