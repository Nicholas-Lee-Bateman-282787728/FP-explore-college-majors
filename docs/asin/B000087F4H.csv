Carey ""waymorefun""","[0, 0]","I must admit I am prejudiced about this disc, first I love Irish music and second I love these guys, still in all it is a really good DVD showing the boys during one of their reunion tours.  Lots of good music and great fun for all to enjoy and it helps that the boys all seemed to be having a good time too.  I was fortunate to have been able to meet and get to know Tommy at his club in Manhattan and I spent many of my best moments in New York at the Pavillion.Since we have lost most of these guys in the last few years having this wonderful DVD is the best way to remember them and still keep a little piece of them with us.",5,Great entertainment,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,629,"['must', 'admit', 'am', 'prejudiced', 'disc', 'first', 'love', 'Irish', 'music', 'second', 'love', 'guys', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'DVD', 'showing', 'boys', 'one', 'reunion', 'tours', 'Lots', 'good', 'music', 'great', 'fun', 'enjoy', 'boys', 'seemed', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'too', 'was', 'fortunate', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'meet', 'get', 'know', 'Tommy', 'club', 'Manhattan', 'spent', 'many', 'best', 'moments', 'New', 'York', 'Pavillion.Since', 'have', 'lost', 'most', 'guys', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'having', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'best', 'way', 'remember', 'still', 'keep', 'little', 'piece']",N/A

734720,A3JRQ6I2XZ710D,B000087F4H,Louise,"[1, 1]",I am rating this DVD 5 stars because it is the Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem.  It is also the only DVD I could find of them performing live in concert.  I was fortunate to see the group back in 1969 live in NYC.  Oh how I loved them and had most of their LP albums.  Recently I decided to play some of their Cd's that I have and realized how much I had missed not playing their music in a long time.  I then thought to see where they might be performing.  I did not realize that they had all died.  Time has a way of just slipping by.  I am now 69 and just didn't realize how old they would be today.  To have seen them live in their youth was a wonderful experience.  This group transcends all others.  Liam is fantastic when he sings a slow ballad.  Together this group were pure entertainers.  I was a little disappointed in this DVD.  The quality of it was not very good - in fact it was a little blurry.  The group seemed to have lost some of their youthful energy.  I had hoped that the audio quality would be a bit better.  I still give it 5 stars and I am so happy to have this DVD of them performing live.  If you are a fan of theirs this is a must have DVD.  I will miss these guys but now in addition to there CD's I can now watch this DVD.  I also recently purchased another DVD called The Story of the Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem that every fan of theirs should have.,5,Best Irish Group Ever,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1382,"['am', 'rating', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'Clancy', 'Brothers', 'Tommy', 'Makem', 'also', 'only', 'DVD', 'could', 'find', 'performing', 'live', 'concert', 'was', 'fortunate', 'see', 'group', 'back', '1969', 'live', 'NYC', 'Oh', 'how', 'loved', 'had', 'most', 'LP', 'albums', 'Recently', 'decided', 'play', 'Cd', 'have', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'missed', 'not', 'playing', 'music', 'long', 'time', 'then', 'thought', 'see', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'performing', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'had', 'died', 'Time', 'way', 'just', 'slipping', 'am', 'now', '69', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'old', 'would', 'be', 'today', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'youth', 'was', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'group', 'others', 'Liam', 'fantastic', 'when', 'slow', 'ballad', 'Together', 'group', 'were', 'pure', 'entertainers', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'quality', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'fact', 'was', 'little', 'blurry', 'group', 'seemed', 'have', 'lost', 'youthful', 'energy', 'had', 'hoped', 'audio', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'better', 'still', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'have', 'DVD', 'performing', 'live', 'are', 'fan', 'theirs', 'must', 'have', 'DVD', 'will', 'miss', 'guys', 'now', 'addition', 'CD', 'can', 'now', 'watch', 'DVD', 'also', 'recently', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'called', 'Story', 'Clancy', 'Brothers', 'Tommy', 'Makem', 'fan', 'theirs', 'should', 'have']",N/A
