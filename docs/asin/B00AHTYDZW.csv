My main issue with this is that it is being sold like it is an actual movie that may have something to do with a dollhouse. Sounds good to me. Anthologies are always fun. But it has nothing to do with a dollhouse and isn't a real anthology, as others have pointed out.The only one of these three movies worth watching is ""Dollman Vs Demonic Toys"" which is an okay movie, and at an hour long,Haunted Dollhouse's abridgement of it still includes half the picture. The other two cannot have as much said for them. You barely see the monsters in those and then only in disjointed, unconnected scenes that are overshadowed by the crap scenes used to set up the premise of the film (if that can be said to have happened at all).I bought mine from Full Moon direct and really wish I had read the reviews here first.Just one more nail in the coffin of the once great Full Moon name.",1,Complete waste of time,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,952,"['will', 'not', 'belabor', 'main', 'detriments', 'movie', 'everyone', 'else', 'My', 'main', 'issue', 'being', 'sold', 'actual', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'dollhouse', 'good', 'Anthologies', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'nothing', 'do', 'dollhouse', ""n't"", 'real', 'anthology', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'movies', 'worth', 'watching', 'Dollman', 'Vs', 'Demonic', 'Toys', 'okay', 'movie', 'hour', 'long', 'Haunted', 'Dollhouse', 'abridgement', 'still', 'picture', 'other', 'two', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'said', 'barely', 'see', 'monsters', 'then', 'only', 'disjointed', 'unconnected', 'scenes', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'crap', 'scenes', 'used', 'set', 'up', 'premise', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'happened', '.I', 'bought', 'mine', 'Full', 'Moon', 'direct', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'first.Just', 'one', 'more', 'nail', 'coffin', 'once', 'great', 'Full', 'Moon', 'name']",Haunted Dollhouse

As other reviewers stated I did not make it through much of this movie. I jumped off the boat right after the random 2 cent nudie scene with the chick who looks like she got ran over by a Mack Truck. That was approximately 15 minutes into this disaster. I feel bad having spent $1.00 at Redbox on this garbage.
