1141273,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0013D8LMC,Lee Armstrong,"[7, 9]","""Hero Wanted"" is a bumpy, but gripping DVD.  Cuba Gooding Jr. stars in the lead role as Liam Case, a trash collector who has a good day & a bad day.  As the film begins, he rescues a child from a burning car.  He wears the hero recognition uncomfortably.  The film unfolds so that the audience moves deeper into the story as we see the relationships that were not apparent.  Case lost his wife in a tragic accident in which she drowned while trapped in their car.  Gooding starts moving out of his shell as he develops a crush on Kayla McQueen played by Christa Campbell.  Unfortunately, when he goes to the bank where she works, she is shot in the head during the heist, confined in a coma.  We come to learn how his buddy Swain that works with him on the trash truck, well played by Norman Reedus, has taken Case's idea on how to impress a girl to another level by bringing in the McGraw brothers.  Steven Kowalski plays the leader Lynch while his younger brother Skinner played by Kim Coates discharges his gun during the bank heist, unfortunately fatally wounding Kayla.  Detective Terry Subcott played by Ray Liotta tries to piece together the relationships of the crime.  Case goes after younger brother Skinner in the factory where he sleeps and then after Lynch in a bar.  Faced with a string of bodies, Subcott starts looking more closely at the vigilante played by Gooding.  Tommy Flanagan whose scarface makes Derek looks like a crazed killer with an itchy trigger finger takes over the gang & lures Liam to a confrontation by kidnapping the little girl he saved at the beginning of the film.  Meanwhile, Jean Smart from TV's ""Designing Women"" plays Melanie McQueen, Kayla's mother, and urges Liam to get revenge.  The bloody battle that climaxes the film comes with a pivotal choice by Swain to side with Case.  There's an irony as Liam hangs onto a tropical postcard labeled ""Paradise.""  All in all, this was a good engaging shoot-'em-up.  Gooding focuses well, being very different from his Oscar-winning performance in ""Jerry McGuire.""

Is it because our lives lie in ruin afterward, forgotten by the world? How do we go on, and why should we care?

A sliver of love are the tears falling from my eyes for I am to blame, and justice needs to hear my cry. But what kind of hero is painted in red?

Hero Wanted is one of those direct-to-video films. It follows the story of a man who tries to live the righteous life, but even the best of people have their breaking point. This was a really interesting story, with some unexpected twists and turns. It was a pretty good film that really fell under the radar. The story was great and the acting was top notch, but the way it was filmed really left a lot to be desired. The film is frequently jumping months ahead or to a flashback, without any notice or footnotes, it made parts of the film very confusing. There were also a couple of pretty big plot holes, that added to the confusion. This is by no means a classic, but the acting was terrific, the action was pretty cool, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,895,"['Being', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'direct-to-video', 'stuff', 'hard', 'remember', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'are', 'award', 'winning', 'actors', 'Hero', 'Wanted', 'one', 'direct-to-video', 'films', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'live', 'righteous', 'life', 'even', 'best', 'people', 'have', 'breaking', 'point', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'story', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'really', 'fell', 'radar', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'really', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'film', 'frequently', 'jumping', 'months', 'ahead', 'flashback', 'notice', 'footnotes', 'made', 'parts', 'film', 'very', 'confusing', 'were', 'also', 'couple', 'pretty', 'big', 'plot', 'holes', 'added', 'confusion', 'means', 'classic', 'acting', 'was', 'terrific', 'action', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit']",Hero Wanted

1141281,A1C87GAJNODOE6,B0013D8LMC,"T. Thomas ""Mamadawg""","[0, 0]","I reviewed this film for IMDB earlier last month and I am c/p'ing my review here...This is a movie worth watching simply because of the psychological issues dredged up in it! The dark side of heroism is something that movies like the 'Batman' flicks usually dig up, but this one definitely has a combination of elements that will leave a viewer asking, who was really a hero here? Was anyone? It definitely hits home that there is no black and white when it comes to certain dark areas of our lives. It also drives home that sometimes heroes are anything but depending on which character one is watching closely here.I will say this though, the character of Cosmo Jackson as played by Ben Cross should have gotten a lot more attention than what was given. Mr. Cross made THAT character real. He has a knack for that. I wish other producers and directors would take the time to give this guy a chance to prove his metal in other films. Until I saw this, I really couldn't picture him playing a Viet Nam War Veteran! This guy is REALLY under-utilized in my opinion.I also feel that Gary Cairns deserves a pat on the back for his role. He did an excellent job bringing out the emotions of his character also, and I hope to see more of him in the future because he has the ability to make a film shine also.Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ray Liotta may have gotten top billing for this film and they are great in it, don't get me wrong, but I watch every actor and how they bring out their characters when I see a film and I watched this one twice. All of them did a great job, but I focus on Cairns and Cross because they both have that same knack for bringing out emotions in a realistic fashion and that keeps viewers coming back for more!Comparing this movie to football, Gooding and Liotta get a lot of attention because they are quarterbacks in the movie industry and they do a great job when they play! I love watching them! However, Cross and Cairns deserve a heck of a lot more respect than the kickers in the game ever get--that's for sure!",5,This movie rocks,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,2036,"['reviewed', 'film', 'IMDB', 'earlier', 'last', 'month', 'am', ""c/p'ing"", 'review', 'here', 'movie', 'watching', 'simply', 'psychological', 'issues', 'dredged', 'up', 'dark', 'side', 'heroism', 'something', 'movies', ""'Batman"", 'flicks', 'usually', 'dig', 'up', 'one', 'definitely', 'combination', 'elements', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'asking', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'hero', 'here', 'Was', 'anyone', 'definitely', 'home', 'black', 'white', 'when', 'certain', 'dark', 'areas', 'lives', 'also', 'home', 'sometimes', 'heroes', 'are', 'anything', 'depending', 'character', 'one', 'watching', 'closely', 'here.I', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'character', 'Cosmo', 'Jackson', 'played', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'lot', 'more', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'Mr.', 'Cross', 'made', 'THAT', 'character', 'real', 'knack', 'wish', 'other', 'producers', 'directors', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'give', 'guy', 'chance', 'prove', 'metal', 'other', 'films', 'saw', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'picture', 'playing', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'War', 'Veteran', 'guy', 'REALLY', 'under-utilized', 'opinion.I', 'also', 'feel', 'Gary', 'Cairns', 'pat', 'back', 'role', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'out', 'emotions', 'character', 'also', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'future', 'ability', 'make', 'film', 'shine', 'also.Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'top', 'billing', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'watch', 'actor', 'how', 'bring', 'out', 'characters', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'watched', 'one', 'twice', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'focus', 'Cairns', 'Cross', 'have', 'same', 'knack', 'bringing', 'out', 'emotions', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'viewers', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'Comparing', 'movie', 'football', 'Gooding', 'Liotta', 'get', 'lot', 'attention', 'are', 'quarterbacks', 'movie', 'industry', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'when', 'play', 'love', 'watching', 'However', 'Cross', 'Cairns', 'deserve', 'heck', 'lot', 'more', 'respect', 'kickers', 'game', 'ever', 'get', 'sure']",Hero Wanted
