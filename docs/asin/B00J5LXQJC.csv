Very boring movie that tried to give background stories on every cast member but unfortunately did a horrible job in doing so. Even the entire boxing match was slow and drawn out.

1695673,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00J5LXQJC,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","Sailor O'Connor (Dominic Purcell) is a retired boxer, working as a welder. His mom (Sheila McCarthy) claims he is &#34;used up and broken.&#34; She is dying from cancer and bitter at God. She wants to see the &#34;old country&#34; one more time before she dies. Sailor wants to go into the ring to obtain a purse so she can go.As the fight begins the film is consumed with flashbacks, at times getting only 30 seconds of fighting before we go back in time again. During these flashbacks we get to see the life of the other fighter King Solomon (Izaak Smith), newly married with a baby on the way. He has a mother issue also. We get to see behind the scenes of the promotion and the mystery of Diane (Famke Janssen) the woman who has done the &#34;unforgivable.&#34; The film slowly builds levels of complexity around a single fight.I enjoyed the opening of the reading of Percival, and the quick establishment of character. This is not a film about boxing, but that of a fighter. a man who refuses to lay down both in the ring and in life...in case you missed the symbolism.The film was better than expected, and has that life drama that &#34;Lifetime&#34; fans can enjoy as well.Parental Guide: F-bomb.

He is trying to move on when he is approached by a local promoter for one last fight. After agreeing for the biggest payday he's ever had he tells his mother and old trainer, neither of whom is happy about it. His opponent is an up and coming young kid with a past he is also trying to change. Together they fight not only each other but the past they can't forget. As many of you know I am a huge fan of sports movies. Being a lower budget one that not many people have heard of I wasn't expecting too much from this. I'm not sure if that had any effect on my feelings toward this but I really really enjoyed it. Every other boxing movie I have seen tells the story of the characters then ends with the fight. This one switches between the fighting and the story which I really enjoyed. You see some punches then part of the fighters life which segues beautifully into the break in between rounds. That gives extra meaning to the rest period. I could go on and on about this but I'll end by saying I highly recommend this. Overall, not sure if it was because I wasn't expecting something this good but I really enjoyed this. I actually liked it more then The Fighter. I give this an A-.",4,I wasn't expecting something this good. I really enjoyed this. I actually liked it more then The Fighter.

1695675,A2N8Y2OCAK8MR3,B00J5LXQJC,Valerie Beiersdorfer,"[0, 0]","I've been a fan of Dominic Purcell since I first saw him act in the show John Doe. Since then I've watched him in Prison break and other movies he's made. I pre-ordered A Fighting Man because this is Dominic's latest film. Well, I'm not a fan of fighting films except for maybe the Rocky movies, but this is one of the best movies I have seen all year.It's about two fighters. Dominic plays Sailor who has fought 63 fights in his life and has never gone done, but he's also never won a fight. During the film, there are flashbacks to what happened in Sailor's life to make him the man he is today, lonely and very sad. His mom is dying of cancer and wants to visit Ireland one last time. This is one of his reasons for fighting one last fight. Then there's King, who's 20 years old and having a baby with his 18 year old girlfriend. There are also flashbacks in King's life to show you how he got to the point of wanting to make a name for himself in the fight game.I think this is Dominic's best acting to date. As the film progresses and the fight goes on you see and feel for both these men. I cried at the end and that to me shows a very good movie. I love a movie where you feel for the people in the movie. I recommend this movie to anyway who wants to see how two totally different men can go through some terrible things in their life and end up respecting one another in the end.
