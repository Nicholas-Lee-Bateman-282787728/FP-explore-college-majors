The first wasQB VII. Rich man was twelve chapters of television history  that is so good, it could be rerun today and not seem datedRich Man Poor Man (book one) is a story of two brothers,  Rudy (Peter Strauss) and Tom (Nick Nolte). Think Cain and Abel in a modern day setting, Rudy, the good son, strives for wealth and power. Tom, a fighter who lived the seedy side of life and grows into a strong man. Between both of them is Julie (Susan Blakely), who knows both men.The father of the boys (Edward Asner) is a strict hard working man, who owns a Bakery...He is easy on Rudy\ harder on Tom. The mini series took the Jordache family deom the late 1940 to the 1970s.Book one is laiden with cameo roles from such actors as  Steve Allen, Robert Reed, Van Johnson, William Smith (who will surface as the villian in book two), Bill Bixby and  Kay LenzWith success of Book one. ABC network committed to a book two (22 episodes). Book two brought  Rudy. Tom's son Wesley (Gregg Henry) and Julie's son Billy (James Carroll Jordan) into a second Generation story. The problem with book two is plot lines seem weaker than the original and far better mini-series. There are a few storylines that drives this story to the wrapped up tight ending. Strauss tries to topline this second volume of Rich Man like father-like figure, it works some levels and fails on others  at the same time. Book two comes off like an evening soap opera, but it does work if you think of it like that.To unearth this classic mini-series and TV sequel to DVD after 35 years of being in the vault. it shows very little age.

This brilliant production actually was produced and broadcasted before ""Roots"". As a child I watched ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" with my family every week with great anticipation. The seperate individual lives of Rudy and Tom were all people would talk about during the run of this show back in 1976. This is the show which turned Peter Straus and Nick Nolte into household names. And similar to ""Roots"", this series featured a multitude of many familiar faces. Actors like Robert Reed, Ed Asner, Norman Fell, Susan Blakely, Bill Bixby, Van Johnson, Ray Milland, Talia Shire, Kim Darby, just to name a few. I'll also never forget this show featuring one of the greatest fictional villians ever created. That would be Will Smith as Tom's mortal foe, Falconetti. Up until recently I had thought the name was spelled out in two words, ""Falcon Eddie"". (*that's what happens when you don't read the book*) As a kid this guy made me nervous. Now as an adult, he still makes my skin crawl. Truly one of the most dispicable characters ever created. Anyway, I've had this series on a crappy VHS for years. I have been waiting ""YEARS"" for this classic show to come on dvd. And as an added bonus, if I understand this correctly, will also include the sequel, Book 2.

I own Roots (hard to watch, but still brilliant after all these years) and for the past year, I'd been looking for Rich Man Poor Man every few months. When it became available, I was excited because I was a child when this was originally broadcast and was not really allowed to watch it as I had been Roots. I remember how much my mother loved it, Peter Strauss, and then Nick Nolte. One surprise was that Susan Blakley was not as bad as I remember everyone saying she was, even with her frightening, distracting teeth and jaw flexing. Bill Bixby was also quite good and smarmy, and went on to direct a few episodes. The series itself? DEPRESSING! Every single situation is a set up for some DISASTER or another. There are NO HAPPY ENDINGS here, only pleasant interludes, but as I say, those are just the set ups: Rudy goes to college but he has no money; his evil father decides to lend him the money to start his own business, but has to use it to get the screw up brother out of a jam that doesn't even turn out to be true; you think that after the father is gone, the mother is going to get some relief and be happy, but you get to see what an insufferable bitch she either really always was, or became as a result of the years of emotional abuse she suffered at her husband's bread-baking hands; Rudy reunites with the love of his life whom he let get away because he was such a goody-two-shoes, he wouldn't sleep with her in high school, but they make each other so miserable, they can't be friends until they divorce; every time the Nolte character is about to get a break, he tries to control himself but the explodes, messing things up, even if he's in the right--and then years later, his son does the exact same thing...Oh god! and worse yet, nobody learns any lessons what-so-ever!!! Who the hell wants to watch 9 disks of that? What a huge disappointment and there's 2 weeks I'll never get back. I agree with those who said that ""Book One"" w/Nolte was way better than ""Book Two,"" which was carried by the brilliant Susan Sullivan, because Rudy whose supposed to be handsome, popular and powerful, turns out to be pigheaded, more violent than his brother (who had actually been beaten by the father and became a boxer), and ultimately, impotent. The best part about the whole thing was the copious lack of breast implants. It's nice to see that at some point in American history, people didn't all look alike (with big immovable plastic body parts, frozen foreheads and lips that god didn't mean for white people to have or he would have made them that way--see Sylvester Stallone in the Expendables, another disaster!). Even when the bad guy FINALLY GETS IT, there is no satisfaction because he nearly takes everyone with him. And yes, I doubt there has ever been a more oily, better looking, creepy-goofy, murderous, jail-house rapist bad guy than Willie Smith's Falconetti (who looked like Jack Palance). You just keep hoping he gets it but his mindless malice is manic, energizer bunny-powered and you know you're going to have to look at him in yet another episode, wishing you could go through the screen and back 35 years to do it yourself. Willie did a really great job at creating a character so totally un-self aware, delusional, making himself the victim as he attacked one person after another over some perceived slight of his own making. And speaking of 9 disks, if a few of the panoramas, thoughtful pauses, bad face acting and scenes between Kate and Rudy (best described as EXCRUTIATING) where she calls him ""senator"" each and every time, were edited, it would have been at least a disk shorter.

When you watch Nick Nolte in ""Rich Man, Poor Man"", it really makes you realize how long it has been since this wonderful mini series first debuted on TV--1976! Over 30 years ago! I was 12 at the time and I still fondly remember the show.  What a great cast RMPM has: Mr. Nolte (blond and gorgeous and oh so young), Peter Strauss (handsome as the uptight rich brother), Susan Blakely (what a terrific actress she was--haven't seen her in years), Ed Asner (who won an Emmy for his portrayal of Axel Jordache--a character radically different from Lou Grant), the late Bill Bixby (playing the pathetic Willie), Robert Reed (who proved he could play someone other than Mike Brady--he eats up the scenery in a delicious role) and Kim Darby (she's a hoot as the scheming psychotic Virginia Calderwood).  The scene where Virginia pounds on Rudy Jordache's mansion screaming his name has stuck in my mind all these years.  And the heartbreaking ending is still so sad to watch.  I forgot to mention the beautiful Kay Lenz, who ends up marrying Nick Nolte in the final episode.  She's a delight (another great actress who has disappeared).  Unfortunately, the mini series is not available in the United States for some mysterious reason, but you can buy a Region 2 PAL DVD.

694756,A3NI800P6Q6YNS,B000063BJ3,Matthew J. Gallagher,"[166, 169]","I met Peter Strauss for the first time after a staged reading at the Westport Playhouse, in which he, along with several other wonderful actors, gave a superb reading of a new play.  Speaking to him, briefly, afterwards, I mentioned the absence of ""Rich Man"" on DVD - and he agreed. He told me he is asked this a lot and does not understand why a terrific DVD edition of this classic miniseries is not available.  My God, it should be!  This was one of the first real TV ""events"" - must see TV before it really existed - with a superb, involving story of two brothers growing up in turbulent times, their lives and loves, and their ultimate search for happiness. The acting could not be better. Peter Strauss has always been an underrated actor, in my opinion.  In ""The Jericho Mile"" he gives a landmark performance.  Here, in ""Rich Man,"" he believably ages from a high school student to an older, forlorn Senator trying to reclaim his humanity. It was an honor to speak to Mr. Strauss, who could not have been more gracious.  He was eager to see this miniseries on DVD and was also interested in being part of an ""extras"" package to boot. Can you imagine getting Mr. Strauss and Nick Nolte back to discuss the legendary film that began both their careers?  EVERY actor here gives a unique performance.  It was one of the unforgettable TV miniseries.  It deserves a gold star treatment!UPDATE on DVD release! ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" is a five star production, but the DVD release rates barely A STAR AND A HALF - it is almost a travesty.  I would like to commend Mr. Strauss, brilliant in the role in both series, for offering an excellent, perceptive, and interesting one hour long commentary track to accompany the first hour of the original series - but that is the ONLY recommendation I can give to this product.First, the video transfer is poor - there is NO high definition upgrade to the original show at all, so it looks like a typical TV show from the '70's, no upgrades at all. The sound quality is also poor.Second, and most important, the DVD has been EDITED!  Incredibly enough, there are whole scenes missing from the DVD - most grievously, in the final hour of the show, after Rudy nearly loses his career after hurting a college girl, whose photo club had taken nude pictures of a drunken Julie, there is a MISSING SCENE when we see the Van Johnson character return to tell Rudy that his political career can be saved - which leads directly back to the scenes where Julie begins to drink again and, inadvertently, causes a tragedy. The scene is gone! And parts of other scenes, including the introductions to the openings, also appear to be trimmed.I bought some foreign copies of both series some time ago - and both were better than this product. Make no mistake - A & E did this on the cheap and ended up leaving a tarnished legacy for a landmark series. It is STILL worth watching, for all the wonderful stories it tells, but this DVD product is a disgrace - and you will have to find another DVD or VHS tape to actually see the WHOLE series. The VHS tapes actually seem to have better sound and picture quality and more beautifully packaged as well. I would stick with them, except that Book Two, which has great moments, is not available on VHS tapes, but only on foreign DVD's, which, I'm sure, are of better quality than this disgrace.

Although I admit that I originally had second-thoughts about the price before deciding to pull the ""buy"" trigger several months ago (plus I don't know anything about RMPM 2 and had to hope it doesn't turn out to be a price-inflating dog), the opportunity to own RMPM 1 was just too much to pass up. Fortunately, by the time it shipped Amazon's pre-order price guarantee had brought my copy down to $35, more than well-worth it in my opinion.The story is epic and superbly told.  Audio/video, so far, equally superb. Heck, they could even have stuck in the original commercials (or, to make additional revenue, maybe even current commercials, I suppose) - being a TV mini-series, the commercial breaks are obvious and I half-way expected a real commercial to come on when they occurred, that's how good the remastered quality is - you feel like you're watching a current show.If you love well-done and well-acted mini-series with a well-told storyline, whether or not you have seen RMPM before, you won't regret buying this one.  I CANNOT say well-acted enough to do RMPM justice! As others have noted, it made Nick Nolte a star.  I don't know if Peter Strauss was unknown or not before RMPM, but he was certainly better known after it. The other performances cannot be beat either, plus you will never meet a better-portrayed bad guy than Falconetti. It is the Nick Nolte-Falconetti storyline that is the most memorable for me. You will have your own favorite portion of the story to remember.As for Robert Reed's missing ""willy"" and backside that seems to concern a couple of other reviewers about possible editing, it is possible that RMPM was originally aired in two versions, one for the American audience and one for the more nudity-tolerant European TV audience. That could be why Region 2 shows the backside and Region 1 doesn't. I don't know if that's the case, just speculating so because one reviewer says his Region 2 sports a bare-bottomed Reed.

694779,A3R5AFKW4FP0U5,B000063BJ3,SusieQ,"[1, 2]","Out of nostalgia, I recently borrowed this DVD set from the library. I'd seen both series (books I and II) back in the '70's and was curious to see if they held up.What had always stuck in my head from past viewings of this miniseries was Nick Nolte's performance as Tom Jordache, and that, still, makes this DVD worth watching.  Nolte does occasionally slide into a Southern-flavored accent, for no discernable reason. Maybe it was Nolte's way of conveying Tom's working-class demeanor. But when it happens, it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Aside from that oddity, his performance is excellent.  Nolte is able to strike a balance between Tom's ""loner"" or outsider status and his inner tenderness, with great results.  He's especially moving in two deathbed scenes.Peter Strauss nicely conveys most of Rudy's characteristics from Shaw's novel, and makes him probably a more sympathetic character than he is in the book.  I never thought much of the actress Susan Blakely, and her performance as Julie, Rudy's true love, is nothing special.  It's a tribute to Strauss and Nolte that I couldn't picture their parts being played by any other actors, but Blakely brings nothing to her performance that any other reasonably accomplished 1970's actress wouldn't have given.  Blythe Danner, Madeline Stowe or Jenny Agutter (if she could have done an American accent) might really have brought something to Julie that Susan Blakely couldn't.Supporting performances vary - Ed Asner and Dorothy McGuire are very good as Axel and Mary Jordache, but Robert Reed's performance as Teddy Boylan, with his odd take on a British-like accent, is very stiff.  But it serves its purpose.  Bill Bixby is charming and ultimately pathetic as Willie Abbott.  Talia Shire is good as Tom's slutty first wife, but Kay Lenz as Kate is pretty bad.  She doesn't bring any earthiness or sensibility to the part of Tom's last love (at least, as per her character in the novel) - just a kind of surfer-girl shallowness.Two of the biggest disappointments for me regarding ""Rich Man, Poor Man Book I"" are:  first, the washed-out colors of the video transfer.  This is particularly noticable in long shots and outdoor scenes.  Second, is the casual approach taken by the producers in creating authentic 1945-1965 time period(s) with the right costumes and hairstyles.  There's lip service to the 1940's in the first two episodes (and that's not consistent), but after that, it's pretty much still mostly 1970's in terms of costumes, hair & makeup, aside from a bouffant hairdo sported by Susan Blakely in some early 1960's scenes.  These inaccuracies didn't annoy me as a kid watching this back in the '70's but they annoy me now.I consider ""Book II"" a waste of time.  It's a feast of embarrassingly bad acting; abrupt scene changes; poor dialogue; boring plot lines, and is even more slipshod in terms of recreating an authentic late 1960's-period hair and costumes, than Book I was in creating the 1945-1965 era.  Plus, it was a total cash-in attempt to ride the coattails of Rich Man, Poor Man's success, without good source material (which Book I has, thanks to Irwin Shaw's novel).  Nolte was right to refuse to appear in it.All that being said:  Would I buy or rent this?  Rent only, and for ""Book I"" only.  That's a good story based on a good novel, and is still engaging (despite some deadish/soap-opera moments, mostly in the Rudy-Julie relationship) and upheld by a fine performance from Nick Nolte.",3,Rent it for the first installment; skip the second,1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,3474,"['nostalgia', 'recently', 'borrowed', 'DVD', 'set', 'library', ""'d"", 'seen', 'series', 'books', 'II', 'back', ""'70"", 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'held', 'up.What', 'had', 'always', 'stuck', 'head', 'past', 'viewings', 'miniseries', 'was', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Jordache', 'still', 'DVD', 'worth', 'watching', 'Nolte', 'occasionally', 'slide', 'Southern-flavored', 'accent', 'discernable', 'reason', 'Maybe', 'was', 'Nolte', 'way', 'conveying', 'Tom', 'working-class', 'demeanor', 'when', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'Aside', 'oddity', 'performance', 'excellent', 'Nolte', 'able', 'strike', 'balance', 'Tom', 'loner', 'outsider', 'status', 'inner', 'tenderness', 'great', 'results', 'especially', 'moving', 'two', 'deathbed', 'scenes.Peter', 'Strauss', 'nicely', 'most', 'Rudy', 'characteristics', 'Shaw', 'novel', 'probably', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'book', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'actress', 'Susan', 'Blakely', 'performance', 'Julie', 'Rudy', 'true', 'love', 'nothing', 'special', 'tribute', 'Strauss', 'Nolte', 'could', ""n't"", 'picture', 'parts', 'being', 'played', 'other', 'actors', 'Blakely', 'nothing', 'performance', 'other', 'reasonably', 'accomplished', '1970', 'actress', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'American', 'accent', 'might', 'really', 'have', 'brought', 'something', 'Julie', 'Susan', 'Blakely', ""couldn't.Supporting"", 'performances', 'vary', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Axel', 'Mary', 'Jordache', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'performance', 'Teddy', 'Boylan', 'odd', 'take', 'British-like', 'accent', 'very', 'stiff', 'purpose', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'charming', 'ultimately', 'pathetic', 'Willie', 'Abbott', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'good', 'Tom', 'slutty', 'first', 'wife', 'Kay', 'Lenz', 'Kate', 'pretty', 'bad', ""n't"", 'bring', 'earthiness', 'sensibility', 'part', 'Tom', 'last', 'love', 'least', 'character', 'novel', 'just', 'kind', 'surfer-girl', 'shallowness.Two', 'biggest', 'disappointments', 'regarding', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'Book', 'are', 'first', 'washed-out', 'colors', 'video', 'transfer', 'particularly', 'noticable', 'long', 'shots', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'Second', 'casual', 'approach', 'taken', 'producers', 'creating', 'authentic', '1945-1965', 'time', 'period', 's', 'right', 'costumes', 'hairstyles', 'lip', 'service', '1940', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'not', 'consistent', 'pretty', 'much', 'still', 'mostly', '1970', 'terms', 'costumes', 'hair', 'makeup', 'aside', 'bouffant', 'hairdo', 'sported', 'Susan', 'Blakely', 'early', '1960', 'scenes', 'inaccuracies', 'did', ""n't"", 'annoy', 'kid', 'watching', 'back', ""'70"", 'annoy', 'now.I', 'consider', 'Book', 'II', 'waste', 'time', 'feast', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'acting', 'abrupt', 'scene', 'changes', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'boring', 'plot', 'lines', 'even', 'more', 'slipshod', 'terms', 'recreating', 'authentic', 'late', ""1960's-period"", 'hair', 'costumes', 'Book', 'was', 'creating', '1945-1965', 'era', 'was', 'total', 'cash-in', 'attempt', 'ride', 'coattails', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'success', 'good', 'source', 'material', 'Book', 'thanks', 'Irwin', 'Shaw', 'novel', 'Nolte', 'was', 'right', 'refuse', 'appear', 'it.All', 'being', 'said', 'Would', 'buy', 'rent', 'Rent', 'only', 'Book', 'only', 'good', 'story', 'based', 'good', 'novel', 'still', 'engaging', 'deadish/soap-opera', 'moments', 'mostly', 'Rudy-Julie', 'relationship', 'upheld', 'fine', 'performance', 'Nick', 'Nolte']","Rich Man, Poor Man: Book 1"

Well, the wait is finally over: on September, 28, 2010 ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" makes its debut on DVD, not only for the fans who remember watching the min-series on television back in the seventies, but for a whole new generation of viewers who can enjoy the series for posterity.It was actually Fred Silverman, the then president of ABC, who green lit ""Rich Man, Poor Man"", TV's first min-series (many give that claim to ""Roots"", but ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" aired in February 1976, a full year before ""Roots""). The series (based on the 1970 Irwin Allen novel) originally aired every Tuesday night, for a total of 12 consequetive episodes before culminating with its finale, a first for this type of programming. The show was both a critical and ratings smash, and executives quickly ordered ""Rich Man, Poor Man-Book 2"" for the fall of 1976. ""Rich Man..."" dealt with the German immigrant family named Jordache and the bulk of the series dramatized the lives of the two Jordache brothers Rudy and Tom. Both were polar opposites: Rudy was intelligent, college educated, and an entrepreneur, where as Tom was defiant and the rebel who turned to boxing to support himself. Julie was the girl with whom Rudy fell in love with.""Rich Man, Poor Man"" was pure soap opera, and was a forerunner to the big primetime serials of the 1980's, showing TV executives that not only would viewers follow a continuous story during the daytime hours, but also during the evening. ""Rich Man..."" garnered several Emmy awards, including wins for its music (the opening theme, composed by Alex North, is still one of the most haunting themes in history), direction, and one for acting. The ensemble cast included Peter Strauss and Nick Nolte (in his first starring role) as the Jordache brothers Rudy and Tom, and Susan Blakely as Julie. Others in the cast included George Maharis, Van Johnson, Dorothy McGuire, Ed Asner (who received an Emmy), Robert Redd, and Dick Sargent.This set includes all episodes from both the original ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" and its sequel and it comes on 9 dics.

Probably bad timing though as I think it's now officially released a lot cheaper. The forerunner of all TV mini series it still holds up as the best ever produced. Nick Nolte as Tom could not have been better cast. I don't know what he is really like but it was as if he wasn't acting as his character was so convincing. Ed Azner played the kind of powerful support role like Burl Ives did in ""A Big Country"" and ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof""Unlike so many other mini series, the story line has some depth and sends us a question of what success and happiness are all about. I also picked up before seeing it on someone else's reveiw,the blooper in filming the World Trade Center. That was built in 1973 well after the time frame of the story. This series I fully recommend as a definate collectors item.",5,Finally have it,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,915,"['seller', 'Rightaway', 'today', 'received', 'six', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'Probably', 'bad', 'timing', 'think', 'now', 'officially', 'released', 'lot', 'cheaper', 'forerunner', 'TV', 'mini', 'series', 'still', 'up', 'best', 'ever', 'produced', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Tom', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'Ed', 'Azner', 'played', 'kind', 'powerful', 'support', 'role', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'did', 'A', 'Big', 'Country', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'Unlike', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'mini', 'series', 'story', 'line', 'depth', 'question', 'what', 'success', 'happiness', 'are', 'also', 'picked', 'up', 'seeing', 'someone', 'else', 'reveiw', 'blooper', 'filming', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'was', 'built', '1973', 'well', 'time', 'frame', 'story', 'series', 'fully', 'recommend', 'definate', 'collectors', 'item']","Rich Man, Poor Man: Book 1"

The storyline was superb, oh, I forgot, I was talking about the book, not the movie. After receiving the DVD set, I promptly fed it in my trusty DVD player and guess what? It's not even closed captioned or subtitled! My wife and I are deaf. Without closed captioning or subtitles, it will not benefit us at all. I immediately returned this movie to Amazon and yes, Amazon did a great job refunding me our hard earned dollars. The distributor, A&E; blatantly ignored the deaf masses. This is discrimination! I have e-mailed to A&E; once before in September, in November and today concerning this DVD expressing my outrage. Guess what? They never replied. Until A & E finally have this DVD in closed captioning or subtitles, I urge you kind consumers, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET!!

694791,A2EUN25B63U0IP,B000063BJ3,William Boswell,"[0, 0]","I've been waiting for this to be released since the early 1980's.  After so many years of waiting I gave up then missed it's release on VHS years ago.  I just found out it was released on DVD last year.  Amazon is terrible about notifying when an item is released after signing up to be notified for unavailable items.  I've done it many times then find it in stores before I ever get notification which is why I keep missing videos I'm interested in.I agree that there appears to be some scenes missing that I remember from the first run back in the 1970's when it first aired.  There was a scene where something was edited out or could have been a bad cut, but the dialog suggested it was an expletive.  There's a scene in Book One where Rudy and Julie are talking at home then the next scene she's in the hospital.  I couldn't figure out if I missed something or if there was a serious cut.  I assumed she was in the hospital for alcoholism, but it wasn't obvious.  Fade ins and outs were edited where coming back from where a commercial would have been, it appears to jump into a scene as if the beginning of the scene was edited.  Running times are not even close on some episodes.  The last chapter for Book One was short about fifteen minutes.I'm thinking that the print A&E; received might not have been the best copy either so we're lucky to have anything at all.  Still, anything is better than the chopped up versions I've seen many years ago in reruns.Overall, I thought the quality was better than what we had seen back in it's day and I'm thankful it finally came out.  I didn't have a problem with the sound and it looked pretty good on my HD TV in comparison to the color TV back then.  I've seen worse picture quality on other DVDs, but I didn't have an overall problem with this one.  Some scenes were a little dark or grainy, but I figured whatever print A&E; used had probably deteriorated over the years.For the price, it's very reasonable to be able to see this again.  I also think it's great that Book Two was also included especially for the low Amazon price.  I wish there had been more commentary from Peter Strauss besides the first hour.  Maybe if they hadn't waited so long to release this they could have gotten interviews or commentaries from some of the stars before they passed away.  It's still worth getting because this mini-series hasn't been on the air in over twenty years.  The last time I saw it was in the 1980's and every two minutes they would break for commericals.  It was so frustrating to watch I gave up.",5,It's About Time This Was Released on DVD,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,2554,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'be', 'released', 'early', '1980', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'waiting', 'gave', 'up', 'then', 'missed', 'release', 'VHS', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'found', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'last', 'year', 'Amazon', 'terrible', 'notifying', 'when', 'item', 'released', 'signing', 'up', 'be', 'notified', 'unavailable', 'items', ""'ve"", 'done', 'many', 'times', 'then', 'find', 'stores', 'ever', 'get', 'notification', 'why', 'keep', 'missing', 'videos', ""'m"", 'interested', 'in.I', 'agree', 'be', 'scenes', 'missing', 'remember', 'first', 'run', 'back', '1970', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'something', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'cut', 'dialog', 'suggested', 'was', 'expletive', 'scene', 'Book', 'One', 'where', 'Rudy', 'Julie', 'are', 'talking', 'home', 'then', 'next', 'scene', 'hospital', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'missed', 'something', 'was', 'serious', 'cut', 'assumed', 'was', 'hospital', 'alcoholism', 'was', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'Fade', 'ins', 'outs', 'were', 'edited', 'where', 'coming', 'back', 'where', 'commercial', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'jump', 'scene', 'beginning', 'scene', 'was', 'edited', 'Running', 'times', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'episodes', 'last', 'chapter', 'Book', 'One', 'was', 'short', 'fifteen', 'minutes.I', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'print', 'A', 'E', 'received', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'copy', 'so', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'have', 'anything', 'Still', 'anything', 'better', 'chopped', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'reruns.Overall', 'thought', 'quality', 'was', 'better', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'back', 'day', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'sound', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'HD', 'TV', 'comparison', 'color', 'TV', 'back', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'picture', 'quality', 'other', 'DVDs', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'overall', 'problem', 'one', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'dark', 'grainy', 'figured', 'print', 'A', 'E', 'used', 'had', 'probably', 'deteriorated', 'years.For', 'price', 'very', 'reasonable', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'again', 'also', 'think', 'great', 'Book', 'Two', 'was', 'also', 'included', 'especially', 'low', 'Amazon', 'price', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'commentary', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'first', 'hour', 'Maybe', 'had', ""n't"", 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'release', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'stars', 'passed', 'away', 'still', 'worth', 'getting', 'mini-series', ""n't"", 'been', 'air', 'twenty', 'years', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'was', '1980', 'two', 'minutes', 'would', 'break', 'commericals', 'was', 'so', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'gave', 'up']","Rich Man, Poor Man: Book 1"
