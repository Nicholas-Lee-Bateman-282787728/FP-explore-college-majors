1221423,A3IN2WR1OYWJTT,B001O0TWY0,"Keri Teach ""Seaviewkat""","[1, 1]","JAG from start to finish was a phenomenal series about the operations of the Judge Advocate General's operations and fulfilment of the legal system that serves our active duty military personell. The character development during this series 10 year run went above and beyond any series I had seen before. This is a series that if one of the networks decided to bring back today would surely have another successful run. The chemistry between the 2 main characters Harmon Rabb and Sarah MacKenzie along with the other characters in the show made this the great series that still continues to be shown on some cable networks. Season 8 would be the season that launched the currently number one hit series currently on CBS the extremely popular NCIS with Mark Harmon from the same producers and which this fall will debut it's 10th season and doesn't show any sign of slowing down. It was amazing that when JAG originally started out on NBC, it was dropped after the 1st season to be picked up by CBS, a decision that I'm sure the executives at NBC have regretted with the long successful run of JAG and subsequently NCIS and it's spin-off NCIS LA. If CBS or another network ever consider putting JAG together again with the same characters and actors they would have to wait for Catherine Bell to be available since she is in another successful series on cable Army Wives. Anyway, If you've never seen any of JAG, and you like series like Law and Order, you'd definitely like JAG. I highly recommend JAG. IF you like NCIS you should really like JAG.
