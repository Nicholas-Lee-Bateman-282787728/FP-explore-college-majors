1102976,A3G9EWST0IHBJ1,B000VLOKIG,Anthony T. Mai,"[5, 5]","Huh...Lucky Star is in the works? That's amazing! Kudos to KyoAni and Bandai! But this is about the last entry to the Limited Edition.To reiterate my previous reviews, packaging is as always in good form. The First Volume now has a snug four DVD cases inside of it on top of the music CDs and other memorabilia that could be stuffed without breaking it, which is a good thin when one must sink in about twice the standard edition price.It was a bit of a surprise that the bonus item was another pillow case, though the sleepover theme was more appropriate than the third volume (Yuki looks in particular divine). Of the four bonus items, the first, brigade leader armband, is the favorite. Great practicality and easily compliments the school uniform should anyone want to cosplay as Haruhi.Now on to the DVDs. I rather liked the English version of ""God Knows,"" and a thumbs up to Wendee Lee for singing both. ""Live Alive"" is the crutch episode of the three. Being also the first to watch, how the song goes set the mood for watching the following two. And to that, ""The Day of Sagittarius"" is a favorite for reviewing again and again. Ah, that Yuki. Finally, ""Someday in the Rain,"" probably the most dull episode of the bunch. What was the reasoning for this ending? I can't tell (Really, I can't. Go read the novels if you can).Subtitles for the most part is ""good."" Always with the yellow! Also something to note which I did not add in the other reviews, there are occasional text that hold significant meaning for the viewer to catch. Sometimes it's not translated into English for risk of cluttering up the screen, and that is understandable. A bonus feature that could be very handy would like those translator notes found in some manga when a cultural disconnect requires explanation to the audience.Who's up for a second season?",5,The Last Review!

Arturo"" on his review. this series is excellent but i was a little disappointed at the ending. i'm glad i paid the extra money for the all four of the special edition sets. after watching the series in chronological order, since i started this way with vol. 1, and than rewatching them in the way it was meant to be watched. the series definitely looses something if watching them chronologically. yes, technically one can get the cheaper version and still watch them all the way it's meant to be but i'm lazy so i'd rather pay a little more so that i wouldn't have to skip episodes or switch dvds in the middle of playing them. also, the extras are pretty nice as well. 5 out 5 watching them the way it's meant to be watched and 3.5 out of 5 chronologically.",5,excellent,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,799,"['i', 'have', 'agree', 'Guillermo', 'Ruiz', 'G.', 'Arturo', 'review', 'series', 'excellent', 'i', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'paid', 'extra', 'money', 'four', 'special', 'edition', 'sets', 'watching', 'series', 'chronological', 'order', 'i', 'started', 'way', 'vol', '1', 'rewatching', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'series', 'definitely', 'something', 'watching', 'chronologically', 'yes', 'technically', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'cheaper', 'version', 'still', 'watch', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'i', ""'m"", 'lazy', 'i', ""'d"", 'rather', 'pay', 'little', 'more', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'skip', 'episodes', 'switch', 'dvds', 'middle', 'playing', 'also', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'nice', 'as', 'well', '5', '5', 'watching', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', '3.5', '5', 'chronologically']",N/A

1102980,A1VQCYJNMU9050,B000VLOKIG,Recovering SWO,"[1, 1]","If you're an Anime Otaku (and you understand what an Anime Otaku is) then this series is for you.  This review concerns Volume 4 of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.BLUF: Worth every pennyDetails: If you're reading this - then you already know the story behind this anime.  (If not, I won't spoil the series here.)  Watching this series in Broadcast Order is essential to appreciating it.  Volume 4 of the Limited Edition box set includes a second DVD with the final installment of the series in Broadcast Order (sorry Dub Fans, it's Subtitled Only).  It also includes a CD with Music from the series that is actually an imported version of a CD sold on the open market in Japan - and if you like the music in this show, you'll want this CD.  Finally, there's beautifully drawn insert that has the show's characters in various poses on both sides that's printed on plastic (the pencil board mentioned in the description and it's actually very nice) and other goodies in the box.So is it worth paying extra for this version versus the Regular Edition.  ABSOLUTELY.  It's actually a great value:-Same DVD you get with the regular edition (price varies - but $20.00 as of this writing)-Final Vol. of the series in Broadcast Order (not available anywhere else - even Japan)-""Suzumiya Haruhi no Tsumeawase"" (about $25 from Amazon Japan depending on the Dollar/Yen rate)-Other goodies thrown in for good measureThe CD contains the following songs from the series:-God Knows-Lost My Music-Koi no Mikuru Densetsu (The Mikuru Legend of Love)The first two songs on this CD are perhaps the most powerful of this season of the series.  Taking care to not spoil anything - read the English Translation of the Japanese Lyrics in the insert AFTER viewing it during the Broadcast Version, it's actually key to the story and why they show the full song in the series.  Watching the English Dub in Broadcast Order just won't have the same effect.Finally, if you haven't watched this series yet - there's enough depth to this show that you'll get something different out of every viewing.This series has my strongest recommendation.",5,Final Installment of the 1st Season of One of the Best Recent Anime Series,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,2114,"[""'re"", 'Anime', 'Otaku', 'understand', 'what', 'Anime', 'Otaku', 'then', 'series', 'review', 'Volume', '4', 'Melancholy', 'Haruhi', 'Suzumiya.BLUF', 'Worth', 'pennyDetails', ""'re"", 'reading', 'then', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'anime', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'series', 'here', 'Watching', 'series', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'essential', 'appreciating', 'Volume', '4', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'box', 'set', 'second', 'DVD', 'final', 'installment', 'series', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'sorry', 'Dub', 'Fans', 'Subtitled', 'Only', 'also', 'CD', 'Music', 'series', 'actually', 'imported', 'version', 'CD', 'sold', 'open', 'market', 'Japan', 'like', 'music', 'show', ""'ll"", 'want', 'CD', 'Finally', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'insert', 'show', 'characters', 'various', 'poses', 'sides', 'printed', 'plastic', 'pencil', 'board', 'mentioned', 'description', 'actually', 'very', 'nice', 'other', 'goodies', 'box.So', 'worth', 'paying', 'extra', 'version', 'Regular', 'Edition', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'actually', 'great', 'value', '-Same', 'DVD', 'get', 'regular', 'edition', 'price', 'varies', '20.00', 'writing', '-Final', 'Vol', 'series', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'not', 'available', 'anywhere', 'else', 'even', 'Japan', 'Suzumiya', 'Haruhi', 'Tsumeawase', '25', 'Amazon', 'Japan', 'depending', 'Dollar/Yen', 'rate', 'goodies', 'thrown', 'good', 'measureThe', 'CD', 'following', 'songs', 'series', '-God', 'Knows-Lost', 'My', 'Music-Koi', 'Mikuru', 'Densetsu', 'Mikuru', 'Legend', 'Love', 'first', 'two', 'songs', 'CD', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'powerful', 'season', 'series', 'Taking', 'care', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'read', 'English', 'Translation', 'Japanese', 'Lyrics', 'insert', 'AFTER', 'viewing', 'Broadcast', 'Version', 'actually', 'key', 'story', 'why', 'show', 'full', 'song', 'series', 'Watching', 'English', 'Dub', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'effect.Finally', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'series', 'yet', 'enough', 'depth', 'show', ""'ll"", 'get', 'something', 'different', 'viewing.This', 'series', 'strongest', 'recommendation']",N/A
1102981,A2BIQJIXLDSJSE,B000VLOKIG,Travis S.,"[3, 3]","While this is the most expensive of the four volumes as of the time this review is written, you clearly weren't going to only get 3 of the DVDs and ignore the 4th one, right? Unlike a lot of anime releases, Bandai actually decided to give you a bunch of cool stuff with your order. First of all, that isn't a mini-pillow in the picture as I originally though, but rather a pillow case. That in and of itself was worth about $10, it's really entertaining just to look at. The CD ""God knows/Lost my Music"" is also some of my favorite Japanese music to date.And of course, we can't forget about the anime itself. The conclusion to the first season of Haruhi is simply awesome. While it does leave a few plot holes, I would definitely recommend the whole series to anyone with even a small interest in anime. The broadcast is definitely the way to watch in my opinion, since the first episode basically explains all the characters in the whole anime, and the last broadcast episode is also the natural climax of the storyline.",5,Must Have for the Haruhi Lover,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,1022,"['most', 'expensive', 'four', 'volumes', 'time', 'review', 'written', 'clearly', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'only', 'get', '3', 'DVDs', 'ignore', '4th', 'one', 'right', 'lot', 'anime', 'releases', 'Bandai', 'actually', 'decided', 'give', 'bunch', 'cool', 'stuff', 'order', 'First', 'all', ""n't"", 'mini-pillow', 'picture', 'originally', 'rather', 'pillow', 'case', 'was', 'worth', '10', 'really', 'entertaining', 'just', 'look', 'CD', 'God', 'knows/Lost', 'Music', 'also', 'favorite', 'Japanese', 'music', 'date.And', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'anime', 'conclusion', 'first', 'season', 'Haruhi', 'simply', 'awesome', 'leave', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'whole', 'series', 'anyone', 'even', 'small', 'interest', 'anime', 'broadcast', 'definitely', 'way', 'watch', 'opinion', 'first', 'episode', 'basically', 'characters', 'whole', 'anime', 'last', 'broadcast', 'episode', 'also', 'natural', 'climax', 'storyline']",N/A
