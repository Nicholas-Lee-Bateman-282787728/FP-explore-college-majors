They picked just the right actor for each character. I was impressed when he asked the man behind the counter if he knew German (not if he spoke German).Talk about nepotism David Matthau plays Ross and someone needs their eyes checked in the credits. The seaplane pilot was defiantly female (suppose to be his doughtier-in-law)Walter Matthau plays a top CIA agent who's being confined by office politics (Myerson) to a desk job for not taking out the Russian agent Yaskov played by Herbert Lom. The disgruntled Matthau quits the service and heads to Austria, where he links up with former lover (a fellow ex-agent) Glenda Jackson. All goes smoothly until Matthau acts on the advice of Yaskov, who suggests that Matthau, his memoirs (his life in the CIA.) Spitefully, Matthau sends out copies of his first chapter to the heads of the spy agencies throughout the world--and from that point on, he and Jackson don't have a moment's peace. This delights Matthau: now that all of his former colleagues are chasing after him, he has a reason to get up in the morning. As written by Brian Garfield, Hopscotch was a conventionally serious espionage novel. As adapted for the big screen by Garfield and Bryan Forbes, Hopscotch is a lively exercise in cloak-and-dagger comedy, even when the pursuit of Matthau turns surprising towards the end.

The Austin Powers movies perhaps?  Or that incredibly lame Leslie Nielsen film...Spy Hard (1996)?  Over-the-top silliness seems to be a common theme in these films, but Hopscotch (1980), based on a book written by Brian Garfield, also a comedy involving spies, manages to rise above, avoiding the slapsticky and crude humor, rather providing a charming and intelligent story that entertains throughout.  Directed by Ronald Neame (Prudence and the Pill, The Poseidon Adventure, The Odessa File), the film stars a wonderful and accomplished cast of actors including Walter Matthau, Glenda Jackson, Sam Waterston, Herbert Lom, and Ned Beatty.Matthau plays Miles Kendig, one of the CIA's top field agents who suddenly finds himself relegated to a desk job after control of the department he works for is taken over by a petty, vindictive, and less than capable man named Myerson (Beatty) who seems to harbor a personal grudge against Kendig.  Unable to deal with riding his career out behind a desk, Kendig leaves the agency, and, after much thought, decides to write his memoirs, detailing all kinds of juicy, sensitive stuff about not only his own agency, but also intelligence agencies throughout the world.  After being in the biz for thirty years, he certainly has the inside scoop on all kinds of things, causing his former boss to put out the order for his termination, elimination, liquidation, extermination, what have you...with the aid of a wealthy widow and love interest named Isobel who was also once in the game, played by Jackson, Kendig begins leading his former colleagues on a chase that spans halfway around the globe, always managing to stay one or two steps ahead.  Will he be able to finish his book before his old agency or that of a foreign power catches up to him?  Even if he does, will he live to see his work published?Hopscotch is a wonderfully witty, light comedy with a dash of sophistication that nearly everyone can enjoy.  Matthau plays his role so perfectly that after seeing the film, you could imagine no one else in the part.  He's certainly got that whole irascible charm thing down, and it fits with the character very well here.  I loved how his character never seemed to lose his calm composure, constantly outwitting and outsmarting his former co-workers in leisure like fashion, given that he probably wrote the book and trained half the men now chasing him.  The element of Kendig using the notion of a book for revenge at first, but then once removed from the work he participated in for so long and seeing just how nasty it is from an outside perspective decides to follow through with his initial threat of finishing the book and getting it published.  Jackson plays so very well off Matthau, and they create a level of chemistry that's pretty rare, in my opinion, between on screen couples.  They just seem to fit so naturally together, creating a level of believability to counteract the somewhat unrealistic element that the CIA are a mostly a bunch of bumbling buffoons.  Did anyone else think her hair was a bit too short, giving her the appearance of a young boy?  Maybe it was just me...  I really enjoyed a young looking Waterston (Law and Order) as Cutter, Kendig's competent and intelligent prot&eacute;g&eacute; now responsible for finding and eliminating his former mentor.  I read that he'd actually come into shooting late due to the film he was working on prior, Heaven's Gate (1980) ran past its' shooting schedule, and is the reason why Waterston looks so very tired in some of the scenes in Hopscotch.  Herbert Lom is also very good as a Soviet agent named Yaskov, one ""who's seen Casablanca one too many times"", although I felt he deserved a bit more screen time.  Ned (Squeal like a pig for me, boy) Beatty is a riot as Myerson, constantly exasperated by his group's futile attempts to put a lid on the loose cannon he himself let loose due to his own petty dislikes for Kendig.  Imagine someone you work with that no one likes, and then that person finally getting a little bit of power, lording over certain individuals, power tripping here and there, but mostly tripping over his own feet, and you basically have Myerson.  The direction by Neame was most excellent, keeping the viewer (me) engaged throughout, with a smooth, steady pace as the story unfolded, which is a bit light in some parts, but did nothing to reduce my enjoyment of this charming, funny film.Criterion provides a superior high-definition digital transfer here in wide screen format and a cleaned up soundtrack.  The quality of the picture is really fabulous, especially when compared to my old VHS copy.  As far as special features are concerned, there's not as much as I would have thought from a Criterion release, but what's here is very worthy.  There's liner notes on the insert inside the DVD case by Bruce Eder, a video introduction by writer Brian Garfield and director Roland Neame along with interviews, a separate audio track, a clean version created for television broadcast along with the original version (there's very little profanity in the film, but what this is comes from Ned Beatty's character Myerson) and an original theatrical trailer along with a teaser trailer for the film.  If you're looking for a smartly funny engaging comedy that only gets better after repeated viewings, then Hopscotch is for you.Cookieman108",5,"He's about to expose the CIA, the FBI, the KGB...and

Many thanks to Criterion for releasing it on DVD!  This film is superb, well-written and directed, with a cast of very gifted performers.  The actors play their roles to the hilt and have a terrific chemistry onscreen.The plot is basic revenge, perpetrated on the CIA by one of its top operatives.  Walter Matthau plays the amiable Kendig, a man who's served in the field for decades and is an excellent agent.  He's smart yet still down-to-earth; his reputation among the underworld of spydom is the stuff of legends.  Kendig is respected even by his enemies for his savvy decisions and sense of fair play, and his reluctance to resort to dirty tricks.  His new boss, Meyerson (Ned Beatty) resents his underling's popularity and decides to neutralize Kendig's effectiveness by yanking him from the field and assigning him to a desk job as a file clerk.To say that Kendig despises his new boss would be a gross understatement.  A switched file is shredded and Kendig vanishes, fleeing to Austria and his lover Isobel (Glenda Jackson).  From there, he nurses his wounds and launches on his vengeance against Meyerson and the CIA by writing a book that reveals the agency's dirty tricks and botched missions.  Meyerson is livid and assigns Joe Cutter (Sam Waterston) to put a stop to Kendig by any means necessary, especially assassination.  Cutter admires Kendig and is torn by his personal feelings for the man and his desire to serve his country.The story then twists and turns as Kendig leads his former employers on a huge wild goose chase.  He calls them from a phone booth right near the CIA headquarters, hides out in Meyerson's southern house---which is later demolished by the feds themselves---, and feeds chapters of the book to Meyerson to whip him into a frenzy of ineffectual rage.  He plans on getting the entire book to a publisher, and his means for doing so and ensuring his own protection from future assassination attempts are ingenious.We are very happy that this movie was released to the public once again.  Matthau is superb as a real man working in an unreal world of espionage.  Herbert Lom is great for the role of his KGB counterpart, and Glenda Jackson is both tart and elegant as the enigmatic Isobel, who frankly adores Kendig.  Ned Beatty plays the part of the oafish Meyerson to perfection, making the viewer hate him thoroughly.  Waterston is in excellent form as the good-hearted and conflicted Cutter, and shows hints of his mildly acerbic wit that would come to fruition in his later role of McCoy.  The supporting players are fine, too, and the plot is well-crafted and believable.The DVD is nicely done.  There aren't many extras, but it's beautifully produced and does have a nice feature:  an alternate soundtrack that deletes the foul language, so even kids can watch it with their parents.  We are pleased with our investment, and highly recommend ""Hopscotch"" to anyone who enjoys a well-done and stylish comedy.

244031,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6301050886,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Another Cold War espionage thriller but this one's got a sense of humor. HOPSCOTCH is fueled predominantly by Walter Matthau's performance. Glenda Jackson, then fresh off her pairing with Matthau from the wonderful HOUSE CALLS, steps in for a bit, but she doesn't get at all a lot of screen time. The few scenes Matthau and Jackson get to do together, you can see how well they play off each other. But, yes, this is predominantly a Walter Matthau vehicle. Without him, HOPSCOTCH falls flat on its face. Because the story? Feh.Decades spent with the CIA as a veteran field operative, and Miles Kendig's independent streak finally gets him disciplined. But Kendig isn't about to take his demotion to desk jockey duty lying down. He erases his personal file and walks out on the agency... and then he starts writing his tell-all memoirs. This instantly targets him for elimination by the CIA. But, first, they have to catch him.There's a sense of repetitiveness in the film. It boils down to Kendig first taunting and toying with his fellow spooks, then the pursuit, then the getaway. Rinse and repeat. It's one big running ""Eff you"" from Kendig to his overbearing ex-boss Myerson. And, without Matthau's steady presence and rumpled, sad-dog-faced charm, it would all have become pretty tiresome really quickly. Partly it's because the movie presents a series of lightweight cat & mouse games rather than the atmospheric skullduggery which pans out in heavy casualties. HOPSCOTCH lacks explosive action-packed encounters, and in fact no one buys the farm in this one. The tone is more amiable, never mind that Ned Beatty cusses up a storm as Kendig's primary and perpetually provoked antagonist Myerson. Beatty is very good, by the way, as is a young Sam Waterston who fleshes out Kendig's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Not really at the level of and tonally different from taut spy classics like THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and MARATHON MAN, HOPSCOTCH offers a less frenzied, more lighthearted look at the world of spooks and skullduggery. But really how many times can we roll with the protagonist tricking the CIA, FBI, and KGB silly thru the cunning subterfuge of assorted passports and messages left on a tape recorder? Walter Matthau makes it work.The locations are a plus; it's a globe-trotting adventure, after all. We get to see Walter Matthau do his thing while framed in breathtaking locales in Salzburg, Bermuda, Munich, and London and Savannah. Referencing the film's tongue-in-cheeked flavor, note also the subtle touch in which the expression on a framed photo of Myerson keeps changing each time the camera falls on it, gradually going from smiley-faced to morose. Give it a look when you get a chance.From the Criterion Collection, this DVD has the following bonus features: informative interviews with director Ronald Neame and writer Brian Garfield (who wrote the titular best-seller novel); an optional broadcast television audio track for those with more delicate ears; the original theatrical trailer and the teaser. The featurette with Neame and Garfield is really worth checking out, by the way, as both cats have some interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits to tell. One of the fun facts we learn is that Walter Matthau loved listening to Mozart, this leading to his film character also being an avid Mozart fan.

It manages to combine intelligence with a sweet good humor that is unusual in this genre.  Most of the time one is either biting one's nails engrossed in the taut suspense of a thriller or laughing in an embarrassed manner over the antics in a slapstick spy comedy.  This film breaks such stereotypes in its witty story of rogue CIA agent Miles Kendig, played expertly by Walter Matthau, out to get revenge on his cruel and crude CIA superior Myerson (Ned Beatty).  The story of how Kendig outwits his CIA boss is compelling not primarily in its suspense but in its creativity and good humor.  Yet the humor is more thoughtful and imaginative than the norm.  It is significant that as an active agent in the field Kendig has not carried a weapon for years, and uses trickery, not force, on his enemies.  In the same vein, weapons and firepower in the film are kept to a minimum; characteristically, no one is killed.The film does include a heavy shot of vulgar and profane language, primarily from the villain Myerson, so anyone wishing to avoid such a verbal blast for themselves and their children, be forewarned.  The romantic relationship between Kendig (Matthau) and a retired agent played by Glenda Jackson is a bit forced, unnecessary, and coarse.

Glenda Jackson has good chemistry with Walter, even though there's an age difference to deal with. And there's a surprisingly good deal of Mozart and Rossini sprinkled throughout the sound track, mainly because Matthau loved these composers. Matthau's character, who's writing an expose (his memoirs) of the CIA, needs writing music and inevitably puts on a record of a Mozart opera (The Marriage of Figaro). This was Matthau's own idea. He seemed to have brought much to this movie. For instance, he dreamed up the sequence where he becomes reacquainted with Glenda Jackson via a conversation with her about wines.

244045,ABE8YHLYSM15G,6301050886,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","This 1980 movie is yet another addition to the extensive list of post Watergate exposes on American intelligence agencies. With the committee led by Senator Frank Church in 1975 and 76 (known as the Church Committee), many secrets were aired pertaining to US intelligence in the chaotic years of the Cold War, mainly in the period after the Kennedy administration. Kennedy had tried to cut back the budget of the CIA and reduce aggresion in foreign operations. The fact that he was killed left many Americans frustrated and cynical about the security aparatus that was meant to prtect Americans, rather than disillusion them. ""Hopscotch"" is a good on screen depiction of this standpoint, which carries cynicism and even anger against super secretive agencies. Walther Matthau gives a great preformance as Kendig, a maverick spy who simply has had enough of his agencies ""tricks"".This movie comes from one of my favorite eras of filmaking, as the late 1970's and early 80's showed huge advances in the skill and scale of Hollywood productions. In comparison to films made 10 to 15 years prior, they have an enormously greater corespondence with reality and touch on deeper and more meaningful social issues. ""The Godfather"" was perhaps one of the first movies that set the standard for what it meant to make a good piece of film. It gave the general public an inside view of secretive aspects of American life that films had never really been able to get at beforehand.Though ""Hopscotch"" is not concerned with the Mafia, it never-the-less exists in the same world of shadowy intrigue and intelligence gathering, as both the CIA and the Mafia kept the true nature of their operations out of the public eye. That is the reason I enjoy this era of movies so much, as it really gives the viewer a fictionalized portrayal of the personalities and situations that were the subject of so much speculation from the media and populace.In ""Hopscotch"", Walter Matthau is able to show the lighter side of the CIA and the global games of cat mouse that they engage in with agents, spies and administrators. As Kendig, he plays a 30 year veteran agent who is demoted by his supervisor Myerson (played by a befuddled Ned Beatty) for his quasi-truce with a KGB agent and decides to intiate a massive manhunt when Kendig goes rogue,sending in copies of his memoirs to various publishing houses around the world. His confession about Myerson's ""dirty tricks"" division makes the movie very contemporary for the post Watergate era (in one of the first scenes Kendig looks at a picture in Myerson's office of a photo op with Nixon).Kendig's travels around the globe are facilitated by a deeply loyal Austrian woman whose relationship with Kendig is typical Matthau goofiness, yet written with an obvious eye for European Cold War detail. Matthau brings a unique character to life in one of the few movies that is able to combine realism regarding intelligence agencies and a comical turn of events. Kendig is on a mission to expose what he refers to as the ""dirty tricks"" division, and many of Myerson's directives towards aprehending Kendig are foiled using Kendig's own version of dirty tricks, but ones with a lively sense of humour.",4,A touch of farce in Agency game of wits,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,3214,"['1980', 'movie', 'yet', 'addition', 'extensive', 'list', 'post', 'Watergate', 'American', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'committee', 'led', 'Senator', 'Frank', 'Church', '1975', '76', 'known', 'Church', 'Committee', 'many', 'secrets', 'were', 'aired', 'pertaining', 'US', 'intelligence', 'chaotic', 'years', 'Cold', 'War', 'mainly', 'period', 'Kennedy', 'administration', 'Kennedy', 'had', 'tried', 'cut', 'back', 'budget', 'CIA', 'reduce', 'aggresion', 'foreign', 'operations', 'fact', 'was', 'killed', 'left', 'many', 'Americans', 'frustrated', 'cynical', 'security', 'aparatus', 'was', 'meant', 'prtect', 'Americans', 'rather', 'disillusion', 'Hopscotch', 'good', 'screen', 'depiction', 'standpoint', 'cynicism', 'even', 'anger', 'super', 'secretive', 'agencies', 'Walther', 'Matthau', 'great', 'preformance', 'Kendig', 'maverick', 'spy', 'who', 'simply', 'had', 'enough', 'agencies', 'tricks', '.This', 'movie', 'one', 'favorite', 'eras', 'filmaking', 'late', '1970', 'early', '80', 'showed', 'huge', 'advances', 'skill', 'scale', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'comparison', 'films', 'made', '10', '15', 'years', 'prior', 'have', 'enormously', 'greater', 'corespondence', 'reality', 'touch', 'deeper', 'more', 'meaningful', 'social', 'issues', 'Godfather', 'was', 'perhaps', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'set', 'standard', 'what', 'meant', 'make', 'good', 'piece', 'film', 'gave', 'general', 'public', 'inside', 'view', 'secretive', 'aspects', 'American', 'life', 'films', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'Hopscotch', 'not', 'concerned', 'Mafia', 'never-the-less', 'exists', 'same', 'world', 'shadowy', 'intrigue', 'intelligence', 'gathering', 'CIA', 'Mafia', 'kept', 'true', 'nature', 'operations', 'public', 'eye', 'reason', 'enjoy', 'era', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'viewer', 'fictionalized', 'portrayal', 'personalities', 'situations', 'were', 'subject', 'so', 'much', 'speculation', 'media', 'populace.In', 'Hopscotch', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'able', 'show', 'lighter', 'side', 'CIA', 'global', 'games', 'cat', 'mouse', 'engage', 'agents', 'spies', 'administrators', 'Kendig', '30', 'year', 'veteran', 'agent', 'who', 'demoted', 'supervisor', 'Myerson', 'played', 'befuddled', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'quasi-truce', 'KGB', 'agent', 'decides', 'intiate', 'massive', 'manhunt', 'when', 'Kendig', 'rogue', 'sending', 'copies', 'memoirs', 'various', 'publishing', 'houses', 'world', 'confession', 'Myerson', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'division', 'movie', 'very', 'contemporary', 'post', 'Watergate', 'era', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'Kendig', 'picture', 'Myerson', 'office', 'photo', 'op', 'Nixon', '.Kendig', 'travels', 'globe', 'are', 'facilitated', 'deeply', 'loyal', 'Austrian', 'woman', 'relationship', 'Kendig', 'typical', 'Matthau', 'goofiness', 'yet', 'written', 'obvious', 'eye', 'European', 'Cold', 'War', 'detail', 'Matthau', 'unique', 'character', 'life', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'able', 'combine', 'realism', 'regarding', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'comical', 'turn', 'events', 'Kendig', 'mission', 'expose', 'what', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'division', 'many', 'Myerson', 'directives', 'towards', 'aprehending', 'Kendig', 'are', 'foiled', 'using', 'Kendig', 'own', 'version', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'ones', 'lively', 'sense', 'humour']",Hopscotch VHS

244058,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301050886,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Hopscotch (Ronald Neame, 1980)What happens when the CIA decides to put a longtime, successful, high-powered spy out to pasture because he's getting old? That's a question that's been dealt with many times (usually in Robert Ludlum-esque cold war thrillers), but never so amusingly as in Ronald Neame's 1980 film Hopscotch which, in the age of Valerie Plame and the media dimwits who outed her, is--as is more and more often the case with political flicks we found absurd-yet-compelling in the seventies (viz. The Conversation)--even more relevant today than it was thirty-two years ago.Miles Kendig (The Bad News Bears' Walter Matthau) has flipped from the ""asset"" side of the balance sheet to the ""liability"" side, as far as his boss, Myerson (Deliverance's Ned Beatty) is concerned. And for Miles, the feeling's mutual--he's fed up with the incompetence of Myerson and his new flunkie, Cutter (Law and Order's Sam Waterston). In order to show them just how incompetent they are, he issues them a challenge: prevent him from writing a tell-all memoir that will expose reams of highly classified information, not to mention how horribly it's handled by the CIA, the KGB, etc. And thus begins Miles' last great spy game.Perhaps the movie's most surprising note is that the romance subplot (and I use the term ""romance"" loosely here; Matthau and Glenda Jackson behave more like an old married couple) doesn't feel in any way forced in a movie that really has no place for a romance subplot. Neame and Brian Garfield (Death Wish), adapting his own novel, take enough of a slice-of-life approach in between the car chases and stuff blowing up that it works. (Imagine a romance subplot in, say, Ronin and you'll see just how ludicrous the idea is.) And that's a great example of what a surprise this movie is decades later; with the cold war long over and most of the countries mentioned in the film as enemies now considered our allies, this should feel as dated as a Bell Telephone commercial, and yet it still pops. Ronald Neame, who died in 2010 at the ripe old age of 99, was nominated for three Oscars in his career, all in the forties--twice for writing (both times for David Lean films) and once for special effects. Hopscotch is a very good case that some of Neame's directorial work should perhaps have been more closely scrutinized by the Academy. *** ",4,Matthau for President: Now More than Ever!,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,2358,"['Hopscotch', 'Ronald', 'Neame', '1980', 'What', 'when', 'CIA', 'put', 'longtime', 'successful', 'high-powered', 'spy', 'pasture', 'getting', 'old', 'question', 'been', 'dealt', 'many', 'times', 'usually', 'Robert', 'Ludlum-esque', 'cold', 'war', 'thrillers', 'never', 'so', 'amusingly', 'Ronald', 'Neame', '1980', 'film', 'Hopscotch', 'age', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'media', 'dimwits', 'who', 'outed', 'more', 'more', 'often', 'case', 'political', 'flicks', 'found', 'absurd-yet-compelling', 'seventies', 'viz', 'Conversation', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'was', 'thirty-two', 'years', 'Kendig', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'flipped', 'asset', 'side', 'balance', 'sheet', 'liability', 'side', 'as', 'far', 'boss', 'Myerson', 'Deliverance', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'concerned', 'Miles', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'fed', 'up', 'incompetence', 'Myerson', 'new', 'flunkie', 'Cutter', 'Law', 'Order', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'order', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'incompetent', 'are', 'issues', 'challenge', 'prevent', 'writing', 'tell-all', 'memoir', 'will', 'expose', 'reams', 'highly', 'classified', 'information', 'not', 'mention', 'how', 'horribly', 'handled', 'CIA', 'KGB', 'etc', 'thus', 'Miles', 'last', 'great', 'spy', 'movie', 'most', 'surprising', 'note', 'romance', 'subplot', 'use', 'term', 'romance', 'loosely', 'here', 'Matthau', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'behave', 'more', 'old', 'married', 'couple', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'forced', 'movie', 'really', 'place', 'romance', 'subplot', 'Neame', 'Brian', 'Garfield', 'Death', 'Wish', 'adapting', 'own', 'novel', 'take', 'enough', 'slice-of-life', 'approach', 'car', 'chases', 'stuff', 'blowing', 'up', 'Imagine', 'romance', 'subplot', 'say', 'Ronin', ""'ll"", 'see', 'just', 'how', 'ludicrous', 'idea', 'great', 'example', 'what', 'surprise', 'movie', 'decades', 'later', 'cold', 'war', 'long', 'most', 'countries', 'mentioned', 'film', 'enemies', 'now', 'considered', 'allies', 'should', 'feel', 'as', 'dated', 'Bell', 'Telephone', 'commercial', 'yet', 'still', 'Ronald', 'Neame', 'who', 'died', '2010', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', '99', 'was', 'nominated', 'three', 'Oscars', 'career', 'forties', 'twice', 'writing', 'times', 'David', 'Lean', 'films', 'once', 'special', 'effects', 'Hopscotch', 'very', 'good', 'case', 'Neame', 'directorial', 'work', 'should', 'perhaps', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'closely', 'scrutinized', 'Academy', '***']",Hopscotch VHS

As for the cast, Jackson is a perfect droll foil for Matthau's wild irreverence as he undertakes writing his memoirs -- a disclosure of CIA operations during his career as station head in Europe -- and then proceeds to release them, a chapter at a time, to all the major powers. Suddenly, everyone wants the memoirs -- and Matthau -- suppressed, with extreme prejudice. And the chase is on.If you're looking for fast action, gun battles, car chases, and Matrix-style special effects, look elsewhere.

His Miles Kendig looks like a long stretch of bad road, a world-traveled but not weary agent who understands that the game of espionage is exactly that, a game, even if his superior (played here as a bloated, self-important right-winger by Ned Beatty) think it's more about crushing your opponent than misguiding him or her to your advantage.  When he's threatened with a desk job for making the right choice in the field, Kendig takes a vacation with an old flame, the intellectual's sexpot, Glenda Jackson, only to be inspired to write his memoirs, a definite no-no in his profession.  What ensues provides comic relief that is also at once entirely believable.  There are lots of great character actors in this movie, from Sam Waterston to Herbert Lom to Severn Darden, the last of which will evoke memories of an even better satire, ""The President's Analyst.""

""Hopscotch"" is neither a seat-of-the-pants thriller nor a side-splitting comedy, but as with so many projects of the decade that immediately preceded it, a very adult film with just enough fantasy to leave you stirred without being too shaken.

It is well presented on DVD here.Mles Kendig, is an aging spy. When reassigned from the field to desk duty, he beomes furious and starts to expose top secret information to the intelligence agencies of several countries and announces intentions to publish it. There are some great comedic scenes in it including where Kendig hides out in his boss' s house and his boss watched in horror as the SWAT team shoots up the house.The acting in the film is quite good and has some excellent scenes in it. Actress Glenda Jackson's slight resemblance to actress Jolene Blalock is apparent in this film, and being a Star Trek fan, I find this comical.The Criterion DVD has some great special features including one which in very unique.There is, of course, a theatrical trailer, and a teaser trailer. There is also an introduction to the film with interviews of Ronald Neame and Brian Garfield, the film's director and writer, respectively.Also, there is a second audio track which was used for television airings of the film. This dubbed track replaces most of the profanity in the film with less objectionable words. Though it is listed for ""family viewing""  there is still violence in the film and would probably get a PG rating.Fans of other spy comedies will love this one!",4,A great spy comedy. one of the best!,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,1419,"['review', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film.Hopscotch', 'starring', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'one', 'better', 'spy', 'comedies', 'have', 'seen', 'well', 'presented', 'DVD', 'here.Mles', 'Kendig', 'aging', 'spy', 'When', 'reassigned', 'field', 'desk', 'duty', 'furious', 'expose', 'top', 'secret', 'information', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'several', 'countries', 'announces', 'intentions', 'publish', 'are', 'great', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'including', 'where', 'Kendig', 'out', 'boss', 's', 'house', 'boss', 'watched', 'horror', 'SWAT', 'team', 'shoots', 'up', 'house.The', 'acting', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'Actress', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'slight', 'resemblance', 'actress', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'apparent', 'film', 'being', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'find', 'comical.The', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'one', 'very', 'unique.There', 'course', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'also', 'introduction', 'film', 'interviews', 'Ronald', 'Neame', 'Brian', 'Garfield', 'film', 'director', 'writer', 'respectively.Also', 'second', 'audio', 'track', 'was', 'used', 'television', 'airings', 'film', 'dubbed', 'track', 'most', 'profanity', 'film', 'less', 'objectionable', 'words', 'listed', 'family', 'viewing', 'still', 'violence', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'PG', 'rating.Fans', 'other', 'spy', 'comedies', 'will', 'love', 'one']",Hopscotch VHS

244069,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6301050886,Turfseer,"[5, 14]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***You'll probably love 'Hopscotch' if you love Walter Matthau. It's really a one man show with the supporting cast playing second fiddle all the way to the late, great thespian. The film dates back to 1980 during the height of the Cold War. Matthau plays Miles Kendig, a veteran CIA agent who takes down a Soviet spy ring but declines to eliminate the leader of the operation, his KGB nemesis, Yaskov. Kendig has been friends with Yaskov for years and when his new boss at CIA headquarters, Myerson (played by an unpleasant Ned Beatty who continually employs the ""F"" word throughout the movie), is angered by Kendig's refusal to eliminate Yaskov, he transfers the veteran operative to the file room.Kendig then destroys his own file and takes off without telling anyone at the CIA where he is off to. He then meets with Yaskov who offers him a job as a double agent but Kendig apologetically declines. Yaskov then asks Kendig what he'll do with the rest of his life and when Kendig replies that he's uncertain, Yaskov suggests that he write his memoirs. This is the impetus for the second act of 'Hopscotch' in which Kendig decides to take his revenge on his former employer by sending the first chapter of his memoirs to various spy agencies around the world including the CIA. The memoirs chronicle a long history of CIA 'dirty tricks' in which Myerson had a big hand. Myerson is bent on eliminating Kendig in order to prevent the big expose.The rest of Hopscotch involves a cat and mouse game where Myerson, along with the operative who replaced Kendig, Cutter (ably played by a young Sam Waterson), attempt to discover Kendig's whereabouts before he finishes his manuscript and has it published. Kendig ends up globe trotting including a trip to Myerson's house in Georgia where he places firecrackers inside the living room and then phones the CIA from Myerson's home phone. The FBI joins the CIA and they end up shooting up the house as the firecrackers go off. Kendig escapes by taking one of Myerson's bumbling operatives hostage, driving off in a small truck (since this is supposed to be a comedy, no one ever tries to jump Kendig while he brandishes a gun, knowing full well that he would never shoot anyone!).Nothing much else happens until the climax when Kendig rigs an old bi-plane to fly via remote control. As Myerson chases the bi-plane in a helicopter, Kendig pushes a button and the plane explodes, leading the CIA to believe that Kendig is no more (it's not clear how Kendig makes it look like he never got into the plane). With the CIA no longer chasing him, Kendig's memoirs becomes a best-seller and he walks off into the sunset with his old flame, Isobel, played by the now retired Glenda Jackson.We first meet Isobel at the beginning of the film where Kendig rekindles his old relationship with her in Austria. Unfortunately, the chemistry between the two actors fizzles, since they are never seen face to face until the end of the movie (they communicate constantly via telephone). The same goes for all the other principals (including Beatty and Waterston) who have virtually no screen time face to face with Matthau (there's a rather flat scene where Kendig ties Cutter up in a hotel room).If you're looking for many twists and turns, you will not find it here in 'Hopscotch'. The whole thing is a rather pedestrian affair, adapted from a popular novel whose screenplay did not translate very well into the intended visual tour de force. Hopscotch is also supposed to be witty and amusing but is undercut by the one-note, nasty image of the CIA, represented by the aforementioned unpleasant Myerson, bent on taking down a rogue agent at any cost. The CIA's attempt to eliminate Kendig (instead of capturing him), ruins the otherwise whimsical tone of the film's narrative. On the other hand, Waterson's 'Cutter' and Herbert Lom's 'Yaskov' are too warm-hearted to have much effect on the proceedings, as the story simply plods along.My late father, a big classical music aficionado, was a big fan of this movie and with a plethora of all that Mozart constituting the film's soundtrack, I can understand why. Despite the endearing musical score, Hopscotch's plot is a big dud as its protagonist's machinations do not prove to be very clever. If you're willing to give Hopscotch a 'pass' based on your love for Walter Matthau (as Roger Ebert did in his 1980 review), then you might deceive yourself into believing this is a well-written movie. It's not and in reality it's a rather dull and boring affair!",2,Tale of Matthau's rogue CIA agent is a rather dull and boring affair,1270252800,"04 3, 2010",2010,4569,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***You', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', ""'Hopscotch"", 'love', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'really', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'supporting', 'cast', 'playing', 'second', 'fiddle', 'way', 'late', 'great', 'thespian', 'film', 'back', '1980', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'Matthau', 'Miles', 'Kendig', 'veteran', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'down', 'Soviet', 'spy', 'ring', 'eliminate', 'leader', 'operation', 'KGB', 'nemesis', 'Yaskov', 'Kendig', 'been', 'friends', 'Yaskov', 'years', 'when', 'new', 'boss', 'CIA', 'headquarters', 'Myerson', 'played', 'unpleasant', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'who', 'continually', 'F', 'word', 'movie', 'angered', 'Kendig', 'refusal', 'eliminate', 'Yaskov', 'veteran', 'operative', 'file', 'room.Kendig', 'then', 'own', 'file', 'off', 'telling', 'anyone', 'CIA', 'where', 'then', 'Yaskov', 'who', 'job', 'double', 'agent', 'Kendig', 'apologetically', 'Yaskov', 'then', 'Kendig', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'rest', 'life', 'when', 'Kendig', 'uncertain', 'Yaskov', 'write', 'memoirs', 'impetus', 'second', 'act', ""'Hopscotch"", 'Kendig', 'take', 'revenge', 'former', 'employer', 'sending', 'first', 'chapter', 'memoirs', 'various', 'spy', 'agencies', 'world', 'including', 'CIA', 'memoirs', 'chronicle', 'long', 'history', 'CIA', 'tricks', 'Myerson', 'had', 'big', 'hand', 'Myerson', 'bent', 'eliminating', 'Kendig', 'order', 'prevent', 'big', 'expose.The', 'rest', 'Hopscotch', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'where', 'Myerson', 'operative', 'who', 'replaced', 'Kendig', 'Cutter', 'ably', 'played', 'young', 'Sam', 'Waterson', 'attempt', 'discover', 'Kendig', 'whereabouts', 'manuscript', 'published', 'Kendig', 'up', 'globe', 'trotting', 'including', 'trip', 'Myerson', 'house', 'Georgia', 'where', 'firecrackers', 'living', 'room', 'then', 'CIA', 'Myerson', 'home', 'phone', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'end', 'up', 'shooting', 'up', 'house', 'firecrackers', 'go', 'off', 'Kendig', 'escapes', 'taking', 'one', 'Myerson', 'bumbling', 'operatives', 'hostage', 'driving', 'off', 'small', 'truck', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'one', 'ever', 'jump', 'Kendig', 'gun', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'would', 'never', 'shoot', 'anyone', '.Nothing', 'much', 'else', 'climax', 'when', 'Kendig', 'old', 'bi-plane', 'fly', 'remote', 'control', 'Myerson', 'bi-plane', 'helicopter', 'Kendig', 'button', 'plane', 'explodes', 'leading', 'CIA', 'believe', 'Kendig', 'more', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'Kendig', 'look', 'never', 'got', 'plane', 'CIA', 'no', 'longer', 'chasing', 'Kendig', 'memoirs', 'best-seller', 'sunset', 'old', 'flame', 'Isobel', 'played', 'now', 'retired', 'Glenda', 'Jackson.We', 'first', 'Isobel', 'beginning', 'film', 'where', 'Kendig', 'old', 'relationship', 'Austria', 'Unfortunately', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'fizzles', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'face', 'face', 'end', 'movie', 'communicate', 'constantly', 'telephone', 'same', 'other', 'principals', 'including', 'Beatty', 'Waterston', 'who', 'have', 'virtually', 'screen', 'time', 'face', 'face', 'Matthau', 'rather', 'flat', 'scene', 'where', 'Kendig', 'ties', 'Cutter', 'up', 'hotel', 'room', '.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'here', ""'Hopscotch"", 'whole', 'thing', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'affair', 'adapted', 'popular', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'very', 'well', 'intended', 'visual', 'tour', 'force', 'Hopscotch', 'also', 'supposed', 'be', 'witty', 'amusing', 'undercut', 'one-note', 'nasty', 'image', 'CIA', 'represented', 'aforementioned', 'unpleasant', 'Myerson', 'bent', 'taking', 'down', 'rogue', 'agent', 'cost', 'CIA', 'attempt', 'eliminate', 'Kendig', 'instead', 'capturing', 'otherwise', 'whimsical', 'tone', 'film', 'narrative', 'other', 'hand', 'Waterson', ""'Cutter"", 'Herbert', 'Lom', ""'Yaskov"", 'are', 'too', 'warm-hearted', 'have', 'much', 'effect', 'proceedings', 'story', 'simply', 'plods', 'along.My', 'late', 'father', 'big', 'classical', 'music', 'aficionado', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'movie', 'plethora', 'Mozart', 'constituting', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'endearing', 'musical', 'score', 'Hopscotch', 'plot', 'big', 'dud', 'protagonist', 'machinations', 'do', 'not', 'prove', 'be', 'very', 'clever', ""'re"", 'willing', 'give', 'Hopscotch', ""'pass"", 'based', 'love', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'did', '1980', 'review', 'then', 'might', 'deceive', 'believing', 'well-written', 'movie', 'not', 'reality', 'rather', 'dull', 'boring', 'affair']",Hopscotch VHS
