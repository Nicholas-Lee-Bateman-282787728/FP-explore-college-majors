1131507,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B0011KQSWM,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","Law and Order SVU Season Six is exactly what the title says.  The 6th season in a very popular television series.  And even though it's the sixth season, I would say that you could probably watch this without watching any of the other seasons.  But why would you want to?  Even if there isn't a ton of backstory, there's still some, and it's always better to start at the beginning.Law and Order SVU deals with the tougher crimes in NYC.  Those crimes that involve rape, the elderly, and children.  So often they are the saddest and toughest to watch.  But thanks to a spectacular cast, these episodes aren't as dreary and devoid of human compassion as they could be.  Instead of glorifying these crimes, they instead support a sense of justice, and a want to prevent the heinous crimes.  For plot, there wasn't a lot of continuing story from the other seasons in this one, although Stabler's family did come into a few episodes, but largely these were one off episodes.  As such, they were complete on their own and most of them were very interesting and well done.  ""Birthright"" was almost devastating in the choices that family has to make, especially with the law not being caught up to technology.  ""Doubt"" made the viewer decide who was telling the truth between accuser and accused, and made you think of the reasons why you came to that conclusion.  And ""Goliath"" has the team taking on the US Army.  I can't really think of any episodes I didn't like in this season.  Sure there were a few that were just so-so and not standouts, but largely it kept me watching.Characters:Christopher Meloni: Elliot StablerMariska Hargitay: Olivia BensonRichard Belzer: John MunchStephanie March, Alexandra CabotDiane Neal: Casey NovakIce-T: Fin TutuolaB.D. Wong: George HuangDann Florek: Don CragenI still have to say I prefer March to Neal as far as ADAs go.  But in her own way, Casey Novak is an intriguing character.  More brash, and not as sophisticated as Cabot, she gets the job done, but learns a lot in all of the episodes.  Meloni and Hargitay were their usual great selves, and as always, still got more airtime than Belzer and Ice-T.  Although I was happy to see that those two were involved a little more in this season.  Florek though, while making token appearances, didn't get involved in too many of these episodes.  The same goes for Wong.  The bad guys once again were varied and it was hard to tell where your sympathies lie when the whole story is given.  There is a lot to think about anyway when judging these people.Because of the brutal and hard topics this series covers, it may not be for everyone.  It all depends on what you're comfortable with, and what you're comfortable having your children watch.  There is violence, blood, sexual content, and a whole lot of other things that can be tough.  And the camera doesn't shy away from a lot of it.  Even though the filming is mainly done following the detectives around, it still does show the bodies and other evidence that is used in investigating a crime.But in summary, this is a good season.  It keeps things fresh but still maintains that compassion and want to spread knowledge about these topics.  And with the great cast of actors, it's no surprise that this is a long lived series.Review by M.

1131509,AFV2584U13XP3,B0011KQSWM,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 1]","I truly enjoyed the series up until season 7 when they started bringing in the characters personal angst storylines into the show,  that I felt is what brings down the show now.  While I find the main stories of whats the characters are doing for the episode plot lines are still good I truly dislike when you have to deal with say Benson or Stabler's continuing downward spiral partnership as personal problems become to angsty for Stabler or Benson to take care of like Stabler's failing marriage an the like.  This was one of the reasons I disliked series like NYPD Blue or The Commish where you have the writers bring in so much of the characters personal problems or relationship anxieties where it causes problems at the work in a effort to try and humanize the characters more,  but for me it just felt like one of those trashy daytime soap operas where you just want to fast forward past the characters angsty scenes and get back to the main story of the episode.  I'm not trying to rag on the series,  some of the episodes are still enjoyable to watch but when they have to bring in the usual personal partner angst into the episode so much where you truly are starting to dislike the characters then the producers will start having problems.  So while you'll enjoy some of the series expect the dreaded soap opera like drama to begin with the start of this season....",4,Still An Enjoyable Show But The Personal Story Angst Brings It Down,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,1377,"['truly', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'up', 'season', '7', 'when', 'started', 'bringing', 'characters', 'personal', 'angst', 'storylines', 'show', 'felt', 'what', 'down', 'show', 'now', 'find', 'main', 'stories', 'whats', 'characters', 'are', 'doing', 'episode', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'truly', 'dislike', 'when', 'have', 'deal', 'say', 'Benson', 'Stabler', 'continuing', 'downward', 'spiral', 'partnership', 'personal', 'problems', 'become', 'angsty', 'Stabler', 'Benson', 'take', 'care', 'Stabler', 'failing', 'marriage', 'like', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'disliked', 'series', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'Commish', 'where', 'have', 'writers', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'characters', 'personal', 'problems', 'relationship', 'anxieties', 'where', 'problems', 'work', 'effort', 'try', 'humanize', 'characters', 'more', 'just', 'felt', 'one', 'trashy', 'daytime', 'soap', 'operas', 'where', 'just', 'want', 'fast', 'forward', 'characters', 'angsty', 'scenes', 'get', 'back', 'main', 'story', 'episode', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'rag', 'series', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'when', 'have', 'bring', 'usual', 'personal', 'partner', 'angst', 'episode', 'so', 'much', 'where', 'truly', 'are', 'starting', 'dislike', 'characters', 'then', 'producers', 'will', 'start', 'having', 'problems', 'So', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'series', 'expect', 'dreaded', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'begin', 'start', 'season']",Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Sixth Year
