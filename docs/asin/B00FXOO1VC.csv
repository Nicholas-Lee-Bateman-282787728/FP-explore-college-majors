1673643,A3AVSJAYI2JTWP,B00FXOO1VC,Angel eyes,"[0, 1]","It took me a while to get around to watching this, but I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all. I thought it quite good actually. It is another take on the cannibalism sub-genre of horror movies. If you liked the 1999 movie Ravenous I think you will like this one too as there are some similar plot sequences. The acting is rather good, and from what I can tell the blu ray transfer looks very nice also. At first I was going to give it four stars, but then I reconsidered and bumped it up to five stars. Well, a couple reasons include that it is not a so called &#34;found footage&#34; film which has really worn thin, and it's not in 3D which is tiresome too. I would much prefer to watch a well-made little horror film in the more traditional sense. There is a good amount of &#34;gore&#34; I have to say, but you might expect that in a film about cannibalism. Another movie it sort of reminds me of in the way the father is being the &#34;role model&#34; for the children is Bill Paxton's film Frailty. That movie also had a religious angle to the father's character just like We Are What We Are.

1673652,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00FXOO1VC,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","Dark, slow but steady film about the apparently normal Parker family, who share a macabre secret ritual. Excellent acting and cinematography bring an immediate realism that really carries this film. WARNING: If gore and grossness get to you, stay away. While WE ARE WHAT WE ARE is not just a constant schlock-fest, there is some pretty disturbing stuff here: Short but graphic scenes of an autopsy, etc.There's been some debate about whether or not WAWWA is really a horror film, and I would vote a definite ""yea"" even though the whole mood and atmosphere are different (and better in many ways) than most contemporary horror flicks. There are some elements of suspense, but you know the big ""secret"" before it's halfway through--the cover also gives a decent hint--so it doesn't exactly work as a mystery. Regardless, the brief flashbacks to the family's ancestors in the 1780s add a great deal.Though none of the individual elements here are anything that hasn't been done plenty of times before, WAWWA's whole combination of qualities make it a different experience. It's obviously low budget but still far from being another super-amateurish cheapie. The makers of this film did an excellent job with what they had to work with. There are some blank spots--e.g., the body in the water--and a little stronger sense of place would have been nice.

1673653,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00FXOO1VC,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 6]","In my five decades, I&#8217;ve watched an awful lot of horror films.  I&#8217;m not boasting because would that really be something worth boasting about?  Rather I&#8217;m only trying to point out that it&#8217;s grown increasingly difficult these last few years to legitimately shock me when it comes to anything new or groundbreaking when it comes to a good horror movie.  I have favorites, and I think I also (like so many) have a solid grasp of what makes for a good scare, but, as hard as the cast and crew of WE ARE WHAT WE ARE tried, I think they missed the recipe not so much by a mile as they did by a few rare pieces of raw meat.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)By appearances, the Parkers would seem to be your average American backwoods family.  They&#8217;re quiet.  They&#8217;re reserved.  They keep to themselves.  They have beliefs in God, and old man Parker can even quote scriptures.  Yet beneath that superficial homespun veneer there lurks a deep secret, one that only a freak flood of Biblical proportions will bring to light.  And once it&#8217;s out there, they&#8217;re risk life, liberty, and their own bizarre pursuit of happiness to keep one another safe &#8230; and within the good graces of whatever God they worship.Hollywood has a way of thumbing its nose at middle America that&#8217;s on full display in WE ARE WHAT WE ARE.  Writers, producers, and directors tend to gravitate toward projects that thematically take mainstream American values and then twists them into something few of us could recognize much less give out support to.  One of the most bastardized concepts is faith or, more specifically, religion.  Let&#8217;s say it isn&#8217;t necessarily the Catholic system or the Protestant system or the Methodist system; let&#8217;s just agree it&#8217;s anything that involves any version of the Bible and agree at that.  These Tinseltown elitists will take any swipe at folks who live their lives by a creed, and that&#8217;s the chief complaint I have with Jim Mickle&#8217;s otherwise impressive film: you could&#8217;ve taken faith entirely out of the equation, and you still could&#8217;ve/would&#8217;ve/should&#8217;ve had a functioning idea involving one family tree and its bizarre tradition.  Involving scriptures?  Well, that&#8217;s just icing on Hollywood&#8217;s cake!To be fair, this may not be all of Mickle&#8217;s doing, as the advertising materials clearly explain that Mickle and Nick Damici adapted Jorge Michel Grau&#8217;s screenplay, &#8216;Somos Lo Que Hay,&#8217; for WE ARE WHAT WE ARE.  However, the fact that they were either specifically drawn to this material or decided to utilize it to make the thematic point essentially solidifies my argument.Removing religion from the story and amplifying the ritual aspect to the tale may even have benefitted the elements.  That way, their dedication to an act of cannibalism that occurred out of necessity centuries earlier may even have appeared more macabre.  Instead, they take an easy and all-too-predictable way out.  For shame.Additionally, there&#8217;s a decided lack of a protagonist in the tale.  When you have a veritable family of killers, it&#8217;d be comforting for the viewing audience to know that someone outside of their influence is truly looking on, studying what&#8217;s been happening in the area, and maybe even tracking how many women have gone missing (the town physician/coroner just stumbles across it, further indicting the middle American legal system that generally solves these things before they get this far out of hand).  Granted, in the final quarter of the film, Dr. Barrow (played by veteran Michael Parks) kinda/sorta fits that bill; but by then, even he&#8217;s acting outside his normal sphere of influence, and he&#8217;s reduced to yet another bitter parent who acts on a mission of vengeance instead of doing what&#8217;s best for the community.I get that Hollywood has lost touch with the American heartland, but do they have to cast stones at them every chance they get?Lastly, the script has enough plot holes in it to drive several pick-up trucks through, though only one or two trucks are committed to celluloid.  How is it law enforcement remained completely unaware of thirty missing persons in the same area of the state?  Who the heck was Mrs. Stratton?  What &#8216;act of kindness&#8217; did Marge (a desperately under-used Kelly McGillis) serve upon the homicidal Mr. Parker?  Why did Iris secretly sneak a knife into her pocket when she went out into the woods with the prying deputy if she didn&#8217;t plan to use it?  I could go on, but methinks you get the drift.WE ARE WHAT WE ARE (2013) is produced by Belladonna Productions, Memento Films International, Uncorked Productions, Venture Forth, and The Zoo.  DVD distribution is being handled through Entertainment One (aka E One).  As for the technical specifications, this is one very well produced film, and the highest quality sight and sound definitely contribute to its consistent and rising dread.  Lastly, the disc boasts a handful of special features, including a making-of short, cast and crew interviews, and an audio commentary with the cast and crew.RECOMMENDED.  WE ARE WHAT WE ARE is an effectively creepy flick.  It establishes some modest parameters very early on in the picture, and it never really strays from them &#8230; and that&#8217;s the greatest disappointment to it all.  What could&#8217;ve been a complex and tightly-woven scarefest instead descends into more of the usual Hollywood insults veiled in the guise of modestly budgeted horror film that received accolades from the nitwits who sponsor Sundance Film Festival?  Still, it&#8217;s efficiently made, so director Mickle and his cast have that going for them.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this as a one-off film, but, in my opinion, it has very little re-watch value.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment (aka E One) provided me with an advance DVD copy of WE ARE WHAT WE ARE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Technically Accomplished Horror Film Can't Stop

1673655,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00FXOO1VC,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","This sort of plot has been run before. The directing is what raises this outing above the fray.Here's the scoop. Frank Parker's ancestors came to the new world in the late 18th century. It was tough going and the harsh winter made it tougher so they needed to alter their diet. They twisted the Christian religion to rationalize said diet and wrote a new &#34;family&#34; bible. Now, generations later, Frank's wife has died due to Kuru disease brought on by the odd form of nutrition. Now the family, and their ways, begins to unravel.This is a deliberately paced flick. Some might consider it too slow but I liked it. The performances, particularly that of Michael Parks, are all really good. The two sisters, though not long in the business, seem comfortable in front of the camera. I liked the way the plot points were meted out and began to add up. The climax got a bit clunky. I believed what had to happen. I just didn't believe the way they tried to pull it off. The music also worked well with everything. But here, the director shines. You see from the opening frames that he's in for the long haul and not the quick kill. He pays good attention to the landscape so the viewer gets a good sense of place. I liked his previous &#34;Stake Land.&#34; and his upcoming &#34;Cold in July&#34; is getting a good buzz. I hope to see more of him.The overall user reviews on this aren't all that hot.

1673662,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B00FXOO1VC,kacunnin,"[0, 1]","There is very little mystery in what's going on with the Parker family in WE ARE WHAT WE ARE (2013).  It's clear from the start that their nasty little secret has to do with murder and cannibalism.  Family patriarch Frank Parker (Bill Sage) is bringing up his daughters - Iris (Ambyr Childers) and Rose (Julia Garner) - to follow family traditions outlined in an ancient book dating back hundreds of years, traditions that have taken on religious overtones.  The Parkers are celebrating a communion of sorts, a sharing of ""bread"" as an homage to God and a purification of the soul.  Of course the ""bread"" isn't really bread.  We know what it is, even before the film spells it out.  And director Adam Wingard manages to make a close-up of someone eating a bite of stew seem grotesquely squirm-inducing.WE ARE WHAT WE ARE is a very strange film, reminding me a bit of  DOGTOOTH (2011).  Both films are about weird families with weird practices, suggesting that there can be true horror in so-called ""family dynamics.""  Wingard instills WE ARE WHAT WE ARE with a dreary, sloggy moodiness that permeates every scene.  Rain becomes a virtual character here, dripping into every frame.  In fact, it's the rain that threatens to unravel the Parker family's secrets, as bones from their many communion suppers begin to float downstream, causing a local deputy (Wyatt Russell) and the town doctor (Michael Parks) to get suspicious.  The doctor's daughter disappeared a few years ago, and he can't help but wonder if the weird Parker family is somehow behind it.  The best moment of the film comes when the doctor confronts Frank Parker, asking, ""Did you eat my daughter?""  Great line, that one!In some ways, however, WE ARE WHAT WE ARE is a bit too slow, too dreary, and too weird.  I never really bought the Parker family's religious beliefs - from the start, Iris and Rose seemed uncomfortable with their father's practices.  These are teenage girls who want what all teenage girls want - to be normal!  When their mother dies at the start of the film, it falls to Iris to take over the role of family butcher, but it's a role she has little stomach for.  For much of the film, Iris and her sister are strangely detached from both their father's commitment to ritual cannibalism and the community in which their live.  Their faces are wide-eyed and vacant, and they both seem visibly nauseated by the grotesque bowls of stew they are forced to serve and consume.Which makes what happens at the end (the promised ""shocking"" twist) rather difficult to swallow.  The film's final act ramps up the gore, but what Iris and Rose do makes very little sense.  The audience gets its gross-out moment, but at the expense of logic and believability.  Iris and Rose simply wouldn't do what they end up doing.  But Wingard doesn't care about logic and believability - he's after a certain horrific image that he hopes will linger long after the film's credits role.  And he pretty much gets that, even though the image seems oddly disconnected from everything else that happens in the film.WE ARE WHAT WE ARE isn't a bad film, but neither is it particularly original or compelling.  The X-Files did an episode back in 1995 on a similar theme (""Our Town,"" focusing on cannibalism and Prion disease).  There are few surprises here, at least few surprises that make sense.  I appreciated the performances (Sage, Childers, and Parks especially), and the bleak moodiness of the film is nicely done.  But I can't say it was an enjoyable or exciting experience.  I wouldn't want to watch it a second time.",3,They are what they eat,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,3579,"['very', 'little', 'mystery', 'what', 'going', 'Parker', 'family', 'WE', 'ARE', 'WHAT', 'WE', 'ARE', '2013', 'clear', 'start', 'nasty', 'little', 'secret', 'do', 'murder', 'cannibalism', 'Family', 'patriarch', 'Frank', 'Parker', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'bringing', 'up', 'daughters', 'Iris', 'Ambyr', 'Childers', 'Rose', 'Julia', 'Garner', 'follow', 'family', 'traditions', 'outlined', 'ancient', 'book', 'dating', 'back', 'hundreds', 'years', 'traditions', 'have', 'taken', 'religious', 'overtones', 'Parkers', 'are', 'celebrating', 'communion', 'sorts', 'sharing', 'bread', 'homage', 'God', 'purification', 'soul', 'course', 'bread', ""n't"", 'really', 'bread', 'know', 'what', 'even', 'film', 'out', 'director', 'Adam', 'Wingard', 'make', 'close-up', 'someone', 'eating', 'bite', 'stew', 'seem', 'grotesquely', 'squirm-inducing.WE', 'ARE', 'WHAT', 'WE', 'ARE', 'very', 'strange', 'film', 'reminding', 'bit', 'DOGTOOTH', '2011', 'films', 'are', 'weird', 'families', 'weird', 'practices', 'suggesting', 'can', 'be', 'true', 'horror', 'so-called', 'family', 'dynamics', 'Wingard', 'WE', 'ARE', 'WHAT', 'WE', 'ARE', 'dreary', 'sloggy', 'moodiness', 'scene', 'Rain', 'virtual', 'character', 'here', 'dripping', 'frame', 'fact', 'rain', 'unravel', 'Parker', 'family', 'secrets', 'bones', 'many', 'communion', 'suppers', 'begin', 'float', 'downstream', 'causing', 'local', 'deputy', 'Wyatt', 'Russell', 'town', 'doctor', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'get', 'suspicious', 'doctor', 'daughter', 'disappeared', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'weird', 'Parker', 'family', 'somehow', 'best', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'doctor', 'confronts', 'Frank', 'Parker', 'asking', 'Did', 'eat', 'daughter', 'Great', 'line', 'one', 'ways', 'however', 'WE', 'ARE', 'WHAT', 'WE', 'ARE', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'dreary', 'too', 'weird', 'never', 'really', 'bought', 'Parker', 'family', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'start', 'Iris', 'Rose', 'seemed', 'uncomfortable', 'father', 'practices', 'are', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'want', 'what', 'teenage', 'girls', 'want', 'be', 'normal', 'When', 'mother', 'start', 'film', 'Iris', 'take', 'over', 'role', 'family', 'butcher', 'role', 'little', 'stomach', 'much', 'film', 'Iris', 'sister', 'are', 'strangely', 'detached', 'father', 'commitment', 'ritual', 'cannibalism', 'community', 'live', 'are', 'wide-eyed', 'vacant', 'seem', 'visibly', 'nauseated', 'grotesque', 'bowls', 'stew', 'are', 'forced', 'serve', 'consume.Which', 'what', 'end', 'promised', 'shocking', 'twist', 'rather', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'up', 'gore', 'what', 'Iris', 'Rose', 'do', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'audience', 'gross-out', 'moment', 'expense', 'logic', 'believability', 'Iris', 'Rose', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'Wingard', ""n't"", 'care', 'logic', 'believability', 'certain', 'horrific', 'image', 'will', 'linger', 'long', 'film', 'credits', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'even', 'image', 'oddly', 'disconnected', 'everything', 'else', 'film.WE', 'ARE', 'WHAT', 'WE', 'ARE', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'particularly', 'original', 'compelling', 'X-Files', 'did', 'episode', 'back', '1995', 'similar', 'theme', 'Town', 'focusing', 'cannibalism', 'Prion', 'disease', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'here', 'least', 'few', 'surprises', 'make', 'sense', 'appreciated', 'performances', 'Sage', 'Childers', 'Parks', 'especially', 'bleak', 'moodiness', 'film', 'nicely', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'exciting', 'experience', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'second', 'time']",We Are What We Are
1673663,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00FXOO1VC,K. Reynolds,"[1, 5]","TRADITIONS ARE USUALLY great &#8211; especially during holidays. But, what if descendants of the Donner Party lived in town? The Donners were American pioneers who set out for California only to become snowbound in the Sierra Nevada, resorting to cannibalism to survive. What kind of traditions might have they developed?The cannibalism theme is not much of a spoiler; it&#8217;s easy to guess what&#8217;s going on shortly after the movie begins. What&#8217;s good about &#8220;We Are What We Are,&#8221; based on a Mexican film, is the subtle and suspenseful way director Jim Mickle and writer Nick Damici present their story. You might remember Mickle and Damici from &#8220;Stake Land,&#8221; a classy independent about survival after a vampire apocalypse.&#8220;We Are What We Are&#8221; doesn't fall into the spatter category &#8211; a feat that caused gore-loving horror fans to give negative reviews. It&#8217;s a thriller, restrained and moody. Mickle is on record that he wanted to create a family drama with a horrific secret. Beautifully filmed in upstate New York, the setting could be Anywhere Mountain Rural, USA. It is always raining, maintaining a gothic, small town look &#8211; although that effect turned out to be a challenge. In &#8220;An Acquired Taste: The Making of &#8216;We Are What We Are,&#8217;&#8221; Mickle explains the sun shined throughout filming. The only time it rained was after they&#8217;d finished shooting a scene; other than that, the crew was in charge of creating cloudbursts.Characters &#8211; played by Bill Sage, Julia Garner, Ambyr Childers, Jack Gore, Kelly McGillis (also of &#8220;Stake Land&#8221;), Michael Parks, and Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt and Goldie &#8211; are well drawn, believable and sympathetic.

1673666,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00FXOO1VC,M. Oleson,"[2, 2]","There may be spoilers.I'm going to assume that anyone who is interested in this movie understands what the general theme is.  For those of you who don't, cannibalism is involved.  So if that isn't what you're looking for in a horror film, you might want to look elsewhere.While this remake of a 2010 Mexican film certainly qualifies as a horror film, there are no traditional ""jump out"" scenes and limited gore.  The horror is the subject matter and how 2 young sisters, forced by tradition, have to carry out what they believe to be long standing family values.  Director Jim Mickle certainly has a handle on drama and horror or to be more precise, suspense.  It builds ever so slowly after the Parker family matriarch (Kassie DePaiva) dies mysteriously after fainting and hitting her head on a pipe.  She falls into a partially water filled ditch and eventually drowns.Set in upstate New York, a driving rainstorm causes flooding in the area.  This manages to dislodge suspicious artifacts which begin to wash up on a creek bed.  Discovered by the local coroner, Doc Barrow (a very good Michael Parks), wonders if they might be clues to the mysterious disappearance of numerous individuals, including his own daughter, over the years.  An autopsy of Mrs. Parker provides more clues.After Mrs. Parker is put to rest, patriarch Frank Parker confronts his two daughters.  Iris (Ambyr Childers) is about 16 or 17 and as the oldest must be the chief chef as it were.  Younger sister Rose (Julia Garner) is about 14 and takes responsibility for rearing younger brother Rory (Jack Gore).  A neighbor, Marge offers to assist Frank but he puts her off.  I didn't even recognize Kelly McGillis as Marge.  Many horror-schlock fans may not be happy with the pace of the movie and a lack of gore throughout, but patience has its virtue.  Others, settling in for a white-knuckled suspense drama, may be unhappy with the conclusion.  It took me a day or two to think about it, but I concluded the final scenes are just about perfect.The Blu ray disc comes in a 1080p video resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  While I noticed a brief bit of video noise, the film looks good overall.  It appears the director and cinematographer purposely wanted a dull color grading.  Some of which is due to the bleak home setting and the constant rainfall.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  I thought the sound effects were excellent in this film.  The constant rain changes from a light drizzle to modestly dense rain to a raging storm.  The surrounds are well utilized and the dialog properly centered.  Subtitles are limited to English SDH in this Region A disc.  Extras include a commentary track with the director, screenwriter Nick Damici and some of the actors, a 55 minute ""making of"" feature, a trailer and some interviews with the director, Sage and Garner.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW)  Yum...,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,2853,"['may', 'be', 'spoilers.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'movie', 'what', 'general', 'theme', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'cannibalism', 'involved', 'So', ""n't"", 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'horror', 'film', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'remake', '2010', 'Mexican', 'film', 'certainly', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'traditional', 'jump', 'out', 'scenes', 'limited', 'gore', 'horror', 'subject', 'matter', 'how', '2', 'young', 'sisters', 'forced', 'tradition', 'have', 'carry', 'out', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'long', 'standing', 'family', 'values', 'Director', 'Jim', 'Mickle', 'certainly', 'handle', 'drama', 'horror', 'be', 'more', 'precise', 'suspense', 'ever', 'so', 'slowly', 'Parker', 'family', 'matriarch', 'Kassie', 'DePaiva', 'mysteriously', 'fainting', 'hitting', 'head', 'pipe', 'partially', 'water', 'filled', 'ditch', 'eventually', 'drowns.Set', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'driving', 'rainstorm', 'flooding', 'area', 'dislodge', 'suspicious', 'artifacts', 'begin', 'wash', 'up', 'creek', 'bed', 'Discovered', 'local', 'coroner', 'Doc', 'Barrow', 'very', 'good', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'wonders', 'might', 'be', 'clues', 'mysterious', 'disappearance', 'numerous', 'individuals', 'including', 'own', 'daughter', 'years', 'autopsy', 'Mrs.', 'Parker', 'more', 'clues.After', 'Mrs.', 'Parker', 'put', 'rest', 'patriarch', 'Frank', 'Parker', 'two', 'daughters', 'Iris', 'Ambyr', 'Childers', '16', '17', 'oldest', 'must', 'be', 'chief', 'chef', 'were', 'Younger', 'sister', 'Rose', 'Julia', 'Garner', '14', 'responsibility', 'rearing', 'younger', 'brother', 'Rory', 'Jack', 'Gore', 'neighbor', 'Marge', 'assist', 'Frank', 'off', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'Marge', 'Many', 'horror-schlock', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'pace', 'movie', 'lack', 'gore', 'patience', 'virtue', 'Others', 'settling', 'white-knuckled', 'suspense', 'drama', 'may', 'be', 'unhappy', 'conclusion', 'took', 'day', 'two', 'think', 'concluded', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'perfect.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'disc', '1080p', 'video', 'resolution', '2.39:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'noticed', 'brief', 'bit', 'video', 'noise', 'film', 'good', 'overall', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'purposely', 'wanted', 'dull', 'color', 'grading', 'due', 'bleak', 'home', 'setting', 'constant', 'rainfall', 'audio', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'thought', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'excellent', 'film', 'constant', 'rain', 'changes', 'light', 'drizzle', 'modestly', 'dense', 'rain', 'raging', 'storm', 'surrounds', 'are', 'well', 'utilized', 'dialog', 'properly', 'centered', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'limited', 'English', 'SDH', 'Region', 'A', 'disc', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'Nick', 'Damici', 'actors', '55', 'minute', 'making', 'feature', 'trailer', 'interviews', 'director', 'Sage', 'Garner']",We Are What We Are

If you are looking for a fast paced blood and guts slasher flick you will be better served looking elsewhere. If you are looking for teen sex, drugs and rock ""n"" roll look elsewhere too!This is a slow paced ""let it simmer"" kind of movie that gets to the meat and potatoes of who and what the Parker family is and tells the story of their history in parts through a narrative from their families journal.The story revolves around a family of five deeply religious (mom, dad, 2 daughters and 1 young son) living deep in the South (I believe) who are barely scraping by. The story starts with the loss of the mother and the eldest daughter is ordered to take her mothers place the families hierarcy. This will play a crucial role in the story as it progresses.The town's coroner (Parks) is plagued with guilt from the loss of his missing daughter and his quest for answers leads him on the trail of???The towns sheriff is dismissive of the doc's ideas and has more important things to worry about like the severe weather and a missing girl.This should give you a good idea of the story without giving to much away to see if its your ""cup of tea"" kind of movie.Now for the production side of the movie. The direction and cinematography are top notch for this genre as is the casting, locations, and the acting.  There is no CGI and the special effects are kept to a minimum, but what there is is well done.For me if this movie suffers from anything it might be the pacing and the writing, but neither detract to much from this movie as presented.Rating ) to 5 starsStory = 3.8 It could of had more suspense and a little better pacing.Direction = 3.8 The director could have injected more suspense and fear.Acting = 4 The cast do a great job of telling this story.Gore = 3 There is a fair amount of gore both visual and perceived.Sex/Nudity = 3 There is one scene of sex between the eldest daughter and a deputy without nudity except for the guy's plumbers butt.

The father, Frank Parker, rules the family consisting of teenage daughters Rose and Iris, and young son Rory, with a puritanical dedication to his family&#8217;s legacy.  That legacy, dating back to the 1700s, includes the murder and consuming the body of their victim in an annual feast just as any other family would celebrate Thanksgiving.When Frank&#8217;s wife passes away, the responsibly of assisting him with killing the victims now falls to eldest daughter Iris.  But she and Rose are hesitant, desiring only to be normal teenagers. As they prepare themselves for their ghoulish feast, the local doctor begins unraveling the clues that will reveal their cannibalistic legacy and lead him to discover what happened to his own daughter who went missing.We Are What We Are is a slow moving film and despite its subject matter it is extremely light on blood and gore.  The film was directed by Jim Mickle who directed the excellent 2010 vampire film &#8220;Stake Land&#8221;.  Like that film, this one also relies heavily on characterization and atmosphere.  To that end he employs much of the same cast and crew including actors Kelly McGillis and Nick Damici, Cinematographer Ryan Samul, and composer Jeff Grace.  The film has the same somber and often gloomy tone as Stake Land.  The killing and eating of the body isn&#8217;t done for gruesome effect but rather as a reluctant but respectful almost religious observance of a family tradition.

Their neighbors find them a bit odd, but good, wholesome people with Christian values. Frank, the patriarch of the family, rules with an iron fist, forcing the family to keep with their ancestral traditions at all cost. The mother has died recently, leaving the two oldest girls Rose and Iris to assume her responsibilities in the family and these traditions. The time for the gruesome ritual is upon them and unfortunately coincides with the worst storm they've seen in years. Due to the torrential downpour, clues of their previous rituals are being uncovered by local police and it seems only a matter of time until the family and their unorthodox practices will be discovered.The Parker family appears to be wholesome, good, and pious, but their family dynamic and cannibalistic religious practices are warped and bizarre. The film boils down to the old trying to unsuccessfully stifle and combat the young. Frank Parker is the driving force of their family. Although physically imposing, he is actually weakened by a prion disease contracted from his highly regarded ritual of eating human flesh and is prone to tremors and mental deterioration. He forces his own beliefs and sensibilities onto his children, which are an amalgamation of his ancestor's traditions and Christianity. In the 1700s, their ancestors were stuck in a cave and subsisted on human flesh to survive. Frank is somehow convinced that their family will die out if they don't continue this bizarre tradition exactly how it was done in the past, so they kill and eat one young women a year. Frank represents an old order literally consuming and basically enslaving the unwilling new order, mostly comprised of young women.Rose and Iris are Frank's teenage daughters who are obviously less than enthused about continuing Frank's traditions, but reluctantly follow his leadership. They appear much younger than they are because of the old fashioned, very modest clothes they are forced to wear. Iris also has her hair styled in severe braids to represent Frank's control over them. When they have to kill, gut, and prepare a young woman for their meal, they express disgust, reluctance, and vow to figure out a way out of it for next year. Iris is the older of the two and seems to resign herself unhappily to assume her mother's role in the home and in the ritual. She comports herself as largely silent and stoic, almost zombie-like. When a young deputy expresses interest in her, she quickly shuts him down. Iris wants more out of life and already rejects the insane teachings and authority of her father, but sees no way out of it.Then the young conflict with the old until one is overthrown. Iris' rebellion starts by having sex with the young deputy who she previously rejected. This act is a natural expression of sexuality and appropriate for her age. Her father finds them mid-coitus and slaughters the man while he's on top of her in an effort to bury her burgeoning womanhood and keep her complacent and childlike. Rose's rebellion is represented by her hair. After she rejects the tradition and plans to leave, she stops braiding her hair, leaving it wavy and free. This changes her appearance drastically and gives her more womanly, modern look. Rose and Iris' final rebellion is in their own version of the ritual. Their father tries to kill them and commit suicide when it's obvious that others know their secret. To protect themselves and their little brother, Iris and Rose attack their father using only their teeth and nails and devour his flesh. In stark contrast to their tradition ritual, they attack and eat with savage fervor, acting on instincts rather than thought. Eating their father is getting rid of the diseased old ways and restoring the natural order, giving themselves the opportunity to move forward and have their own lives. Afterwards, they are free and wear modern clothing while they look to build a new life somewhere else. Iris takes the book with their traditions because it's undeniably part of them, but not to continue honoring them.We Are What We Are is a well done horror film with a lot going on under the surface. It goes a different direction than one would expect of a cannibal film. The performances are excellent, especially of Ambyr Childers and Julie Garner as Iris and Rose. I like the pacing of the film and how it methodically tells the story without rushing. The ominous atmosphere of the stormy small town in built and maintained. This film is surprisingly a remake from a 2010 film of the same name set in Mexico. The two films seem to have the same general story line, but not much else in common. This is the example of the rare remake that establishes itself separate from the original and proves to be a good story with excellent execution.",5,A formidable remake with a clear message,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,4865,"['*', 'spoilers', '*The', 'Parkers', 'live', 'small', 'rural', 'town', 'have', 'always', 'kept', 'neighbors', 'find', 'bit', 'odd', 'good', 'wholesome', 'people', 'Christian', 'values', 'Frank', 'patriarch', 'family', 'rules', 'iron', 'fist', 'forcing', 'family', 'keep', 'ancestral', 'traditions', 'cost', 'mother', 'died', 'recently', 'leaving', 'two', 'oldest', 'girls', 'Rose', 'Iris', 'assume', 'responsibilities', 'family', 'traditions', 'time', 'gruesome', 'ritual', 'unfortunately', 'coincides', 'worst', 'storm', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'Due', 'torrential', 'downpour', 'clues', 'previous', 'rituals', 'are', 'being', 'uncovered', 'local', 'police', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'family', 'unorthodox', 'practices', 'will', 'be', 'discovered.The', 'Parker', 'family', 'be', 'wholesome', 'good', 'pious', 'family', 'dynamic', 'cannibalistic', 'religious', 'practices', 'are', 'warped', 'bizarre', 'film', 'down', 'old', 'trying', 'unsuccessfully', 'stifle', 'combat', 'young', 'Frank', 'Parker', 'driving', 'force', 'family', 'physically', 'imposing', 'actually', 'weakened', 'prion', 'disease', 'contracted', 'highly', 'regarded', 'ritual', 'eating', 'human', 'flesh', 'prone', 'tremors', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'own', 'beliefs', 'sensibilities', 'children', 'are', 'amalgamation', 'ancestor', 'traditions', 'Christianity', '1700s', 'ancestors', 'were', 'stuck', 'cave', 'subsisted', 'human', 'flesh', 'survive', 'Frank', 'somehow', 'convinced', 'family', 'will', 'die', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'continue', 'bizarre', 'tradition', 'exactly', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'past', 'kill', 'eat', 'one', 'young', 'women', 'year', 'Frank', 'old', 'order', 'literally', 'consuming', 'basically', 'enslaving', 'unwilling', 'new', 'order', 'mostly', 'comprised', 'young', 'women.Rose', 'Iris', 'are', 'Frank', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'less', 'enthused', 'continuing', 'Frank', 'traditions', 'reluctantly', 'follow', 'leadership', 'appear', 'much', 'younger', 'are', 'old', 'fashioned', 'very', 'modest', 'clothes', 'are', 'forced', 'wear', 'Iris', 'also', 'hair', 'styled', 'severe', 'braids', 'represent', 'Frank', 'control', 'When', 'have', 'kill', 'gut', 'prepare', 'young', 'woman', 'meal', 'express', 'disgust', 'reluctance', 'vow', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'next', 'year', 'Iris', 'older', 'two', 'resign', 'unhappily', 'assume', 'mother', 'role', 'home', 'ritual', 'largely', 'silent', 'stoic', 'almost', 'zombie-like', 'When', 'young', 'deputy', 'interest', 'quickly', 'shuts', 'down', 'Iris', 'more', 'life', 'already', 'insane', 'teachings', 'authority', 'father', 'way', 'it.Then', 'young', 'conflict', 'old', 'one', 'overthrown', 'Iris', 'rebellion', 'starts', 'having', 'sex', 'young', 'deputy', 'who', 'previously', 'rejected', 'act', 'natural', 'expression', 'sexuality', 'appropriate', 'age', 'father', 'mid-coitus', 'man', 'top', 'effort', 'bury', 'burgeoning', 'womanhood', 'keep', 'complacent', 'childlike', 'Rose', 'rebellion', 'represented', 'hair', 'tradition', 'plans', 'leave', 'braiding', 'hair', 'leaving', 'wavy', 'free', 'appearance', 'drastically', 'more', 'womanly', 'modern', 'look', 'Rose', 'Iris', 'final', 'rebellion', 'own', 'version', 'ritual', 'father', 'tries', 'kill', 'commit', 'suicide', 'when', 'obvious', 'others', 'know', 'secret', 'protect', 'little', 'brother', 'Iris', 'Rose', 'attack', 'father', 'using', 'only', 'teeth', 'nails', 'devour', 'flesh', 'stark', 'contrast', 'tradition', 'ritual', 'attack', 'eat', 'savage', 'fervor', 'acting', 'instincts', 'rather', 'thought', 'Eating', 'father', 'getting', 'rid', 'diseased', 'old', 'ways', 'restoring', 'natural', 'order', 'giving', 'opportunity', 'move', 'forward', 'have', 'own', 'lives', 'Afterwards', 'are', 'free', 'wear', 'modern', 'clothing', 'look', 'build', 'new', 'life', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Iris', 'book', 'traditions', 'undeniably', 'part', 'not', 'continue', 'honoring', 'them.We', 'Are', 'What', 'Are', 'well', 'done', 'horror', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'surface', 'different', 'direction', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'cannibal', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Ambyr', 'Childers', 'Julie', 'Garner', 'Iris', 'Rose', 'pacing', 'film', 'how', 'methodically', 'story', 'rushing', 'ominous', 'atmosphere', 'stormy', 'small', 'town', 'built', 'maintained', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'remake', '2010', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'set', 'Mexico', 'two', 'films', 'seem', 'have', 'same', 'general', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'common', 'example', 'rare', 'remake', 'separate', 'original', 'be', 'good', 'story', 'excellent', 'execution']",We Are What We Are
