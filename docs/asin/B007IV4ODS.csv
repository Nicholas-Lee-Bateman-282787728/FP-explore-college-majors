1531609,A2W1FEPSD6EOCI,B007IV4ODS,cinephile,"[21, 26]","Oliver Hermanus wonderfully crafted ""Beauty"" was South Africa's submission to the Academy Awards as well as 2011 Un Certain Regard Cannes Film Festival Nominee and a Cannes award winner. This is a tale of repressed turmoil that slowly creep ups to the viewer. A very capable Deon Lotz plays Franois in an excellent performance filled with subtle anger, rage, jealousy and obsession. These feeling progressively take their toll on the unsuspecting Christian, brilliantly portrayed by Charlie Keegan with a devastating innocence and magnetic charm that will keep audiences disturbed long after experiencing this film.Family man Francois van Heerden is a haven of many secrets. Secrets that deteriorate as well as rot the insides. In his endurance of life's test and family matters, Franois is able to keep an expected straight face in his daily dealings as he slowly asphyxiates for attention from his daughter's mate Christian. Christian, on the other hand, not only regards Francois as an elderly figure worthy of respect due to friendship ties with his father but refers to him as ""uncle"", an adoptive role soon to be tested by an ever raging need to relate in highly improbable ways unbeknown to an oblivious Christian . However, we get the sense that Christian honestly looked up to Francois as an additional father figure source.The platonic dealings slowly eats away at Francois as he repeatedly insists Christian refer to him by his name in order to detract from the connecting familiar upbringing which seems to awkwardly remind Francois to hold back on his planned intentions. Effective scheming leads to the an extremely troubling conclusion based on a number of deliberate choices and sequential actions meant to pander to the vile objectives to be executed.Upon the enforcement of his plans, Franois realizes the results are now irreversible. The damage is done and permanent. The post mutilating events leads to reparations that will ultimately render Francois unrepentant and numb to an uneven arrangement. The brilliance of this story falls within the mix bag of emotions this film emits. The film is beautifully haunting as it unfolds, yet extremely ugly. ""Beauty"" is a cinematic gem worthy of attention because it will illicit a variety of strong and deep long lasting reactions. It will encourage dialogue with other viewers immediately after watching regarding its many unanswered questions of what could have been.",5,"Superlative ""Beauty"" is gut wrenchingly dark & ugly",1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,2433,"['Oliver', 'Hermanus', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'Beauty', 'was', 'South', 'Africa', 'submission', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'as', 'well', '2011', 'Un', 'Certain', 'Regard', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Nominee', 'Cannes', 'award', 'winner', 'tale', 'repressed', 'turmoil', 'slowly', 'creep', 'ups', 'viewer', 'very', 'capable', 'Deon', 'Lotz', 'Franois', 'excellent', 'performance', 'filled', 'subtle', 'anger', 'rage', 'jealousy', 'obsession', 'feeling', 'progressively', 'take', 'toll', 'unsuspecting', 'Christian', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Charlie', 'Keegan', 'devastating', 'innocence', 'magnetic', 'charm', 'will', 'keep', 'audiences', 'disturbed', 'long', 'experiencing', 'film.Family', 'man', 'Francois', 'van', 'Heerden', 'haven', 'many', 'secrets', 'Secrets', 'deteriorate', 'as', 'well', 'rot', 'insides', 'endurance', 'life', 'test', 'family', 'matters', 'Franois', 'able', 'keep', 'expected', 'straight', 'face', 'daily', 'dealings', 'asphyxiates', 'attention', 'daughter', 'mate', 'Christian', 'Christian', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'only', 'Francois', 'elderly', 'figure', 'worthy', 'respect', 'due', 'friendship', 'ties', 'father', 'refers', 'uncle', 'adoptive', 'role', 'soon', 'be', 'tested', 'ever', 'raging', 'need', 'relate', 'highly', 'improbable', 'ways', 'unbeknown', 'oblivious', 'Christian', 'However', 'get', 'sense', 'Christian', 'honestly', 'looked', 'up', 'Francois', 'additional', 'father', 'figure', 'platonic', 'dealings', 'slowly', 'away', 'Francois', 'repeatedly', 'Christian', 'refer', 'name', 'order', 'detract', 'connecting', 'familiar', 'upbringing', 'awkwardly', 'remind', 'Francois', 'hold', 'back', 'planned', 'intentions', 'Effective', 'scheming', 'leads', 'extremely', 'troubling', 'conclusion', 'based', 'number', 'deliberate', 'choices', 'sequential', 'actions', 'meant', 'pander', 'vile', 'objectives', 'be', 'enforcement', 'plans', 'Franois', 'results', 'are', 'now', 'irreversible', 'damage', 'done', 'permanent', 'post', 'mutilating', 'events', 'reparations', 'will', 'ultimately', 'render', 'Francois', 'unrepentant', 'numb', 'uneven', 'arrangement', 'brilliance', 'story', 'mix', 'bag', 'emotions', 'film', 'film', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'yet', 'extremely', 'ugly', 'Beauty', 'cinematic', 'gem', 'worthy', 'attention', 'will', 'illicit', 'variety', 'strong', 'deep', 'long', 'lasting', 'reactions', 'will', 'encourage', 'dialogue', 'other', 'viewers', 'immediately', 'watching', 'regarding', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Beauty

1531614,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B007IV4ODS,J. Martin,"[1, 1]","Beauty is a generally well-made movie about the ugly consequences of sexual repression in an intensely, violently homophobic society in South Africa (although it could just as well have been set in the United States or most other countries). The movie's few serious flaws&mdash;Deon Lotz is not believable as a gay man, even as a severely closeted and homophobic gay man; and Charlie Keegan is nowhere near the beauty the movie makes him out to be&mdash;in a way aren't really flaws at all, because those incongruities reinforce the fundamental impossibility of anything approaching health and sanity in such a perverted society. The true perverts are the homophobes, and this movie exposes them and portrays the hypocrisy, depravity and violence of their lives with great power and clarity.The characters are bilingual; the movie's dialog is about 30% English and 70% Afrikaans, often switching back and forth several times within a single sentence. That would be okay if either both languages were subtitled (the best solution) or if the English were not spoken with a pronounced South African accent&mdash;but instead they chose to subtitle ONLY the words in Afrikaans.Often I found myself wondering why the subtitles suddenly stopped in the middle of a sentence only to realize too late that they were speaking English now and I was supposed to know what they were saying. That's a big mistake. It would have cost them practically nothing to subtitle the English too, but they didn't. It became less of problem later in the movie just because I got used to it, but it never ceased to be a distraction.

1531619,A375NHE4L5104B,B007IV4ODS,LuKasAV6,"[8, 10]","Excellent reviews have already been written, but I had to add my two cents about 'Beauty'. The dangers of repression are brilliantly examined in this searing drama, one of the most disturbing films I've seen in a while. Deon Lotz gives a fearless performance as Francois, a seemingly happily married, well-admired businessman with two daughters. However, not only is he in a loveless marriage and shows no affection toward his wife, he's a closeted gay man filled with self-hatred who is neither enlightened nor heroic during the course of the film. To top it off, he's a racist also. This will turn many viewers off, but actually it's a reflection of a number of hate-filled men. In fact, what made the movie so haunting is that I recognize Francois in a number of men I know casually and personally.From the very beginning of the film, it is obvious that Francois is obsessed with Christian (played with a steady happy-go-lucky focus by Charlie Keegan) who is both the boyfriend of one of Francois's daughters and his best friend's son. This obsession sends Francois spiraling out of control and leads to an event that I did not see coming. I won't give anything else away, but I highly recommend this movie for fans of excellent, thought-provoking character studies that aren't wrapped with a bow.",5,~Intriguing Character Study of a Repressed Homophobe~,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,1300,"['Excellent', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'written', 'had', 'add', 'two', 'cents', ""'Beauty"", 'dangers', 'repression', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'examined', 'searing', 'drama', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Deon', 'Lotz', 'fearless', 'performance', 'Francois', 'seemingly', 'happily', 'married', 'well-admired', 'businessman', 'two', 'daughters', 'However', 'not', 'only', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'affection', 'wife', 'closeted', 'gay', 'man', 'filled', 'self-hatred', 'who', 'enlightened', 'heroic', 'course', 'film', 'top', 'off', 'racist', 'also', 'will', 'turn', 'many', 'viewers', 'off', 'actually', 'reflection', 'number', 'hate-filled', 'men', 'fact', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'haunting', 'recognize', 'Francois', 'number', 'men', 'know', 'casually', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'obvious', 'Francois', 'obsessed', 'Christian', 'played', 'steady', 'happy-go-lucky', 'focus', 'Charlie', 'Keegan', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'Francois', 'daughters', 'best', 'friend', 'son', 'obsession', 'Francois', 'spiraling', 'control', 'event', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'else', 'away', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'excellent', 'thought-provoking', 'character', 'studies', 'are', ""n't"", 'wrapped', 'bow']",Beauty

He has a wife and two daughters and a successful lumber firm, at one of his daughter's weddings he is reunited with an old friend and business acquaintance who has brought his 23 year old son along. This is Christian (Charlie Keegan -`The Sinking of the Laconia') and he has charm, wit and matinee idol good looks `to die for'.The thin veneer of familial bliss is soon seen to be cracking with casual racism, homophobia, an unfaithful wife and children who lie. Also daddy isn't exactly what he seems to be as he goes to bear type all men swingers groups. Needles to say he is not gay, but he soon becomes smitten with Christian. But Christian lives in Cape Town and Francois is in Bloemfontein which is a fair old drive. Undeterred he invents an excuse to go to Cape Town where he will orchestrate a meeting to go to the next level. Well as Oscar Wilde famously said, `there is only one thing worse than unrequited love.....and that is when it is requited'.Beauty or `Skoonheid' to give it its original title is an art house film in many ways. It is both cleverly and artistically shot, the acting is outstanding and the music is understated but works almost subliminally. The pace will be a bit slow for some, but that reflects the narrative which is hardly planned from the players perspective either.There are some bedroom action bits but not in the least frequent but there are some scenes that will be upsetting to some, this is most definitely not a feel good movie. It was South Africa's best foreign language film entry to the 84th Academy awards, so by all accounts there is a lot to merit attention here. I found it slow, brooding and initially unsatisfying; however, on reflection this is a film that will stay with you. The only reason I felt a bit let down is it did not play out how I was expecting and that is in actual fact a very good thing, hence my rating. In Afrikaans and English with a run time of 105 minutes not your run of the mill film and more power to director Oliver Hermanus for that.",4,`I can resist anything except temptation',1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,2099,"['South', 'African', 'story', 'middle', 'aged', 'family', 'man', 'Francois', 'Deon', 'Lotz', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'successful', 'lumber', 'firm', 'one', 'daughter', 'weddings', 'reunited', 'old', 'friend', 'business', 'acquaintance', 'who', 'brought', '23', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'along', 'Christian', 'Charlie', 'Keegan', 'Sinking', 'Laconia', 'charm', 'wit', 'matinee', 'idol', 'good', 'looks', 'die', ""for'.The"", 'thin', 'veneer', 'familial', 'bliss', 'soon', 'seen', 'be', 'cracking', 'casual', 'racism', 'homophobia', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'children', 'who', 'lie', 'Also', 'daddy', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'be', 'bear', 'men', 'swingers', 'groups', 'Needles', 'say', 'not', 'gay', 'soon', 'smitten', 'Christian', 'Christian', 'lives', 'Cape', 'Town', 'Francois', 'Bloemfontein', 'fair', 'old', 'drive', 'Undeterred', 'excuse', 'go', 'Cape', 'Town', 'where', 'will', 'orchestrate', 'meeting', 'go', 'next', 'level', 'Well', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'famously', 'said', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'worse', 'unrequited', 'love', '..and', 'when', ""requited'.Beauty"", 'Skoonheid', 'give', 'original', 'title', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'cleverly', 'artistically', 'shot', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'music', 'understated', 'almost', 'subliminally', 'pace', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'slow', 'narrative', 'hardly', 'planned', 'players', 'perspective', 'are', 'bedroom', 'action', 'bits', 'not', 'least', 'frequent', 'are', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'upsetting', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'South', 'Africa', 'best', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'entry', '84th', 'Academy', 'awards', 'so', 'accounts', 'lot', 'merit', 'attention', 'here', 'found', 'slow', 'brooding', 'initially', 'unsatisfying', 'however', 'reflection', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'only', 'reason', 'felt', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'out', 'how', 'was', 'expecting', 'actual', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'hence', 'rating', 'Afrikaans', 'English', 'run', 'time', '105', 'minutes', 'not', 'run', 'mill', 'film', 'more', 'power', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Hermanus']",Beauty
