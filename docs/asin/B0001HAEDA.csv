805175,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B0001HAEDA,Colleen M. Schneider,"[0, 0]","If you want a higher impact workout and don't mind very little instruction this was a fun one to try.  There is a lot of jumping in this dvd, so I would not recommend if you have knee issues or if you are on a carpeted floor you may want to exercise extra caution on some of the turns.  This dvd showcases traditional folk dance of India known as Bhangra.  This was my first Bhangra workout so I cannot say whether it is authentic or how it rates next to other Bhangra dvds as I am surely no expert, just a person that works out daily that loves to do dance workouts of all types.My one big criticism of this workout is the lack of breaking down the steps.  She does a short warm-up and then gets right into the steps.  They are not shown half tempo and there is no instructional portion of the video.  It wasn't extremely difficult to follow, but there were a couple moves that I just didn't get the first time.  A bit slower as she shows the moves would have been very helpful especially if there are those interested in this type of dance that don't have any type of dance training and need the additional instruction.I would say this is an intermediate dvd and the choreography is moderate.  Though I had fun and did break a mild sweat I would not purchase the dvd for myself, however I might borrow it from the library on occasion when I want to try something different again.Overall, this would have been rated higher if the instruction had been better.",3,Very little instruction.....,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1459,"['want', 'higher', 'impact', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'very', 'little', 'instruction', 'was', 'fun', 'one', 'try', 'lot', 'jumping', 'dvd', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'have', 'knee', 'issues', 'are', 'carpeted', 'floor', 'may', 'want', 'exercise', 'extra', 'caution', 'turns', 'dvd', 'traditional', 'folk', 'dance', 'India', 'known', 'Bhangra', 'was', 'first', 'Bhangra', 'workout', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'authentic', 'how', 'rates', 'other', 'Bhangra', 'dvds', 'am', 'surely', 'expert', 'just', 'person', 'out', 'daily', 'do', 'dance', 'workouts', 'types.My', 'one', 'big', 'criticism', 'workout', 'lack', 'breaking', 'down', 'steps', 'short', 'warm-up', 'then', 'right', 'steps', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'half', 'tempo', 'instructional', 'portion', 'video', 'was', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'difficult', 'follow', 'were', 'couple', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'time', 'bit', 'slower', 'moves', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'helpful', 'especially', 'are', 'interested', 'type', 'dance', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'type', 'dance', 'training', 'need', 'additional', 'instruction.I', 'would', 'say', 'intermediate', 'dvd', 'choreography', 'moderate', 'had', 'fun', 'did', 'break', 'mild', 'sweat', 'would', 'not', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'myself', 'however', 'might', 'borrow', 'library', 'occasion', 'when', 'want', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'again.Overall', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'higher', 'instruction', 'had', 'been', 'better']",N/A

Wells ""Nick...""","[11, 11]","i just wanted to say this is a great workout. i love the eastern dance styles. i have just written a long review of honey's bollywood workout,and people were saying the same things, too fast etc...but indian dance is taught by imitation, and is very expressive facially and bodily(especially the classical dances) and open to improv. bollywood and bhangra are an extension of classical. most don't realize eastern dance is learned and practiced in a vigorous manner imitating, learning, and memorizing from the beginning. the teachers of the classical and indian dances do not like to break up the steps and movement or slow them unless they are so, because you lose the inspiration and the feeling of whatever you may be portraying. so have fun with this, it's awesome and leaves room for your own interpretation of things as mentioned. and it really wears you out. plus everyone looks great dancing and celebrating the movement and abilities of the body no matter the dance form! but i find eastern to be the most passionate, feminine, beautiful, and divine. have fun.",5,cultural,1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,1070,"['i', 'just', 'wanted', 'say', 'great', 'workout', 'i', 'love', 'eastern', 'dance', 'styles', 'i', 'have', 'just', 'written', 'long', 'review', 'honey', 'bollywood', 'workout', 'people', 'were', 'saying', 'same', 'things', 'too', 'fast', 'etc', 'indian', 'dance', 'taught', 'imitation', 'very', 'expressive', 'facially', 'bodily', 'especially', 'classical', 'dances', 'open', 'improv', 'bollywood', 'bhangra', 'are', 'extension', 'classical', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'eastern', 'dance', 'learned', 'practiced', 'vigorous', 'manner', 'imitating', 'learning', 'memorizing', 'beginning', 'teachers', 'classical', 'indian', 'dances', 'do', 'not', 'break', 'up', 'steps', 'movement', 'slow', 'are', 'so', 'lose', 'inspiration', 'feeling', 'may', 'be', 'portraying', 'so', 'have', 'fun', 'awesome', 'room', 'own', 'interpretation', 'things', 'mentioned', 'really', 'out', 'everyone', 'great', 'dancing', 'celebrating', 'movement', 'abilities', 'body', 'matter', 'dance', 'form', 'i', 'find', 'eastern', 'be', 'most', 'passionate', 'feminine', 'beautiful', 'divine', 'have', 'fun']",N/A
805177,AESPPXJJOPPYH,B0001HAEDA,Kaulika,"[12, 12]","There's no denying that this is first and foremost a *fun* workout. Whether you're a dancer or not, this DVD will get you moving, sweating, and smiling.This DVD also struck me as made by dancers for dancers. If you have a dance background, or have a lot of experience picking up choreography, then this will be immediately fun, but still challenging. For those who have no dance background, it will be a steeper learning curve. Much steeper! The moves are fast, energetic and there is no breakdown of the moves. This is a ""follow me"" kind of workout video, where the move is demonstrated at full speed a few times for you to pick up, and then it's straight onto the next move, and the next, and then you're in the routine.The plus for this kind of format is that it's not boring! You are always moving. The down side is for those who need step-by-step instruction, because this doesn't have any. However, this kind of dance style is a folk dance, and the traditional way to learn it is just by watching and following along. Persistence will pay off.The production quality is okay - the set is very basic. There are closeups of the footwork, which is nice.The most important thing to do with this video is to go at your own pace. You can ""tone down"" some of the moves to have a lower impact on your joints, if you have some amount of experience doing that for yourself. There are no tips given on how to lessen the impact of the moves.Also, practice makes perfect. If you work along to this video a few times a week, you *will* pick it up. But you may have to deal with some frustration in the meantime. Just keep going, don't be afraid to laugh at yourself, and have fun. If all else fails, just dance along to the dhol and pick up the steps as you can!",4,"high energy, fun, pretty big learning curve",1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,1753,"['denying', 'first', 'foremost', '*fun*', 'workout', ""'re"", 'dancer', 'not', 'DVD', 'will', 'get', 'moving', 'sweating', 'smiling.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'struck', 'made', 'dancers', 'dancers', 'have', 'dance', 'background', 'have', 'lot', 'experience', 'picking', 'up', 'choreography', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'immediately', 'fun', 'still', 'challenging', 'who', 'have', 'dance', 'background', 'will', 'be', 'steeper', 'learning', 'curve', 'Much', 'steeper', 'moves', 'are', 'fast', 'energetic', 'breakdown', 'moves', 'follow', 'kind', 'workout', 'video', 'where', 'move', 'demonstrated', 'full', 'speed', 'few', 'times', 'pick', 'up', 'then', 'straight', 'next', 'move', 'next', 'then', ""'re"", 'routine.The', 'plus', 'kind', 'format', 'not', 'boring', 'are', 'always', 'moving', 'down', 'side', 'who', 'need', 'step-by-step', 'instruction', ""n't"", 'have', 'However', 'kind', 'dance', 'style', 'folk', 'dance', 'traditional', 'way', 'learn', 'just', 'watching', 'following', 'along', 'Persistence', 'will', 'pay', 'off.The', 'production', 'quality', 'okay', 'set', 'very', 'basic', 'are', 'closeups', 'footwork', 'nice.The', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'do', 'video', 'go', 'own', 'pace', 'can', 'tone', 'down', 'moves', 'have', 'lower', 'impact', 'joints', 'have', 'amount', 'experience', 'doing', 'are', 'tips', 'given', 'how', 'lessen', 'impact', 'moves.Also', 'practice', 'perfect', 'work', 'along', 'video', 'few', 'times', 'week', '*will*', 'pick', 'up', 'may', 'have', 'deal', 'frustration', 'meantime', 'Just', 'keep', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'laugh', 'have', 'fun', 'else', 'just', 'dance', 'dhol', 'pick', 'up', 'steps', 'can']",N/A
805178,A9LATUEW5YOI4,B0001HAEDA,S. Gardner,"[1, 1]","The instructor and demonstrators are professional dancers, and it shows: this is not, not, not a video for someone without coordination, as the moves are not broken down - or even slowed down.  From the beginning, they're performed at full speed.  It's like joining a workshop at a health club halfway through, when everyone knows the moves and you're left to catch up.  You can do it with enough coordination and practice, but it's not going to be a perfect replication of the instructor's moves.  (There is mention in the introduction that bhangra has no rigorus rules which may be why moves aren't broken down.  It's fun to apply your own style, but it's also frustrating trying to get the moves in the first place.)  This is also a very high-impact video - not for someone with bad knees!The production values are meh, with a tiny stage and no sort of dressing to the set.  (This could be an advantage or a disadvantage, but I personally find that it looks cheap.)  In addition to the instructor, there are four demonstrators, all of whom bring their own personality.  Two of the four are men which is a nice inclusion, but the men themselves drive me nuts; everyone has their own personality in their dancing, but they both put too *much* in, especially the guy to the instructor's right, which is a *huge* distraction.  They also occasionally lose the rhythm of the drums (or the drums lose their rhythm, I'm not sure which), which can be a little disorienting.That being said, this is still a lot of fun to do, once you've gotten the moves down.  It'll definitely work up a sweat!  If you don't have the coordination to pick up dance routines (or some dance training), though, you may find it too frustrating to get very far with it and will probably want to look elsewhere.",3,"Great Fun, but Not for the Uncoordinated",1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,1781,"['instructor', 'demonstrators', 'are', 'professional', 'dancers', 'not', 'not', 'not', 'video', 'someone', 'coordination', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'broken', 'down', 'even', 'slowed', 'down', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'performed', 'full', 'speed', 'joining', 'workshop', 'health', 'club', 'halfway', 'when', 'everyone', 'moves', ""'re"", 'left', 'catch', 'up', 'can', 'do', 'enough', 'coordination', 'practice', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'perfect', 'replication', 'instructor', 'moves', 'mention', 'introduction', 'bhangra', 'rigorus', 'rules', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'broken', 'down', 'fun', 'apply', 'own', 'style', 'also', 'frustrating', 'trying', 'get', 'moves', 'first', 'place', 'also', 'very', 'high-impact', 'video', 'not', 'someone', 'bad', 'knees', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'meh', 'tiny', 'stage', 'sort', 'dressing', 'set', 'could', 'be', 'advantage', 'disadvantage', 'personally', 'find', 'cheap', 'addition', 'instructor', 'are', 'four', 'demonstrators', 'whom', 'bring', 'own', 'personality', 'Two', 'four', 'are', 'men', 'nice', 'inclusion', 'men', 'drive', 'everyone', 'own', 'personality', 'dancing', 'put', 'too', '*much*', 'especially', 'guy', 'instructor', 'right', '*huge*', 'distraction', 'also', 'occasionally', 'lose', 'rhythm', 'drums', 'drums', 'lose', 'rhythm', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'disorienting.That', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'do', 'once', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'moves', 'down', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'coordination', 'pick', 'up', 'dance', 'routines', 'dance', 'training', 'though', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'frustrating', 'get', 'very', 'far', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere']",N/A

It think it's good for people who are able and willing to do high impact moves and those who like learning to dance.  It's good for people who have no exposure to dancing bhangra and for those who want to add a few more steps.  There are a lot of dance moves that involve hopping and jumping.  So if you need some cardio, you will find it here.Sarina starts with some workout advice and a short warm up.Sarina doesn't really break down the steps.  She basically demonstrates the steps with four dancers behind her.  If you need precise form details, you won't find it here.  I assume that part of it is because it is a social dance and there is some room for variation.  If you are able to learn from watching a few times and willing to make mistakes, you might enjoy this.She breaks all the moves into combos.  There are about three moves in each combo and four combos total.  At the end of each combo she does a review.  At the end of the 4th combo review, she combines the combos into groups: combo 1&2 and combo 3&4.Afterwards is a short cool down.There is also a live Dhol drummer who comes out to play and you get to watch Sarina and friends freestyle bhangra dance.

The drum beat is simple, but it kept me moving & not bored. Sarina Jain has great energy, you can she has great talent & love of dance. I thought her voice was fine, and because the 2 women & 2 male dancers are well-known they also add the great energy. The only con is that she doesn't break down the moves, she only introduces it by doing it about 4x. Luckily all the moves are simple & easy to figure out within 1-3 viewings.This particular workout has a lot of hopping & kicks, sorta jumping jacks, kicks w/turning the body in a circle, hopping to the side, lifting the knee high for simulation of hitting drums, etc. You can sorta make it more low-impact, but some steps need the momentum of full kicks to do it right.
