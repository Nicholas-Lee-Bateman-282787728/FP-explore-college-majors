348056,A1PEGSF4X09NA3,6302969263,"A. Pfeffer ""apfeffer""","[4, 4]","This movie will delight fans of the British Ealing comedies of the post-WW II era and also Alec Guinness fans.  It's not as well-known or as slick as &#34;The Lady Killers&#34; or &#34;The Man in the White Suit&#34; and hasn't been issued in NTSC disc format since the old laserdisc edition under its U.S. title of &#34;The Promoter.&#34;  So U.S. customers will need a PAL/NTSC/all-region DVD player, such as the Panasonic DVD-S68.  &#34;The Card&#34; is based on an Arnold Bennett story about a spunky young man from a poor working-class family who rises to wealth and power by using his wits, not worrying too much about scruples, and never passing up an opportunity to advance--at someone else's expense if necessary.  The women in his life, other than his gruff mom, include Gwyneth Johns and Petula Clark before she gained fame as a singing star.  Though some of the humor is pretty broad, this is an intelligent movie, not a sappy British farrago like, say, the St. Trinian's, Carry On, or Frankie Howerd series.",5,Lesser-known Ealing/Guinness comedy,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,1019,"['movie', 'will', 'delight', 'fans', 'British', 'Ealing', 'comedies', 'post-WW', 'II', 'era', 'also', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'fans', 'not', 'well-known', 'as', 'slick', '34', 'Lady', 'Killers', '34', '34', 'Man', 'White', 'Suit', '34', ""n't"", 'been', 'issued', 'NTSC', 'disc', 'format', 'old', 'laserdisc', 'edition', 'U.S.', 'title', '34', 'Promoter.', '34', 'So', 'U.S.', 'customers', 'will', 'need', 'PAL/NTSC/all-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'such', 'Panasonic', 'DVD-S68', '34', 'Card', '34', 'based', 'Arnold', 'Bennett', 'story', 'spunky', 'young', 'man', 'poor', 'working-class', 'family', 'who', 'wealth', 'power', 'using', 'wits', 'not', 'worrying', 'too', 'much', 'scruples', 'never', 'passing', 'up', 'opportunity', 'advance', 'someone', 'else', 'expense', 'necessary', 'women', 'life', 'other', 'gruff', 'mom', 'include', 'Gwyneth', 'Johns', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'gained', 'fame', 'singing', 'star', 'humor', 'pretty', 'broad', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'not', 'sappy', 'British', 'farrago', 'say', 'St.', 'Trinian', 'Carry', 'Frankie', 'Howerd', 'series']",Promoter VHS
348057,A1RF91FJZ1XS8G,6302969263,"Beth ""bethiejw2""","[7, 8]",Alec Guinness was one of the best actors of his day and this movie displays this well. In this is he plays a dishonest promoter. But his character is likable and not malicious. He starts out at the beginning as a worker at a morgage company and at the end is a mayor. Along the way you see the mischievous ways he builds himself to the top.Glynis Johns is especially good as a gold digger he meets. His reply to her about her gold digging is very amusing. Other than Alec the second reason I got this was because it stars a very young brunette Petula Clark. Unfortunately her character is under developed.The Promoter is not in the league of his other movies like Last Holiday and The Ladykillers but it's enjoyable.,3,Alec steals the show as usual,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,716,"['Alec', 'Guinness', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'day', 'movie', 'well', 'dishonest', 'promoter', 'character', 'likable', 'not', 'malicious', 'out', 'beginning', 'worker', 'morgage', 'company', 'end', 'mayor', 'way', 'see', 'mischievous', 'ways', 'top.Glynis', 'Johns', 'especially', 'good', 'gold', 'digger', 'reply', 'gold', 'digging', 'very', 'amusing', 'Other', 'Alec', 'second', 'reason', 'got', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'brunette', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'Unfortunately', 'character', 'developed.The', 'Promoter', 'not', 'league', 'other', 'movies', 'Last', 'Holiday', 'Ladykillers', 'enjoyable']",Promoter VHS

Rufo""","[0, 0]","First I should say that I saw this film on VHS under the American title &#34;The Promoter&#34; - although the U.K. title is what shows on the screen. I had seen it once before on television and was struck by something unique about it. This is the only movie I can think of which shows how to make money. In other films, people just have money, or they find it, or they steal it. If someone in the film makes money, he makes it off screen and you never really find out how. Either that or he makes it in such a fantastic way that it could never happen in real life. But here we see Guinness' character from childhood as the only son of a washerwoman, and by the end of the film he is rich, respected, and the mayor of his city. The wonder of this film is that we actually see HOW this happens  - and how it all could happen in reality.Isn't it strange that money is such a big part of life but how to make it is treated like a dirty secret? You can see every sex act you can imagine (and quite a few that you can't) in some movie. You can see other planets and other dimensions. But you never see how someone poor can make himself rich - not through winning a game show or a lottery or idiocy like that, which is just to trick the poor into staying poor. It's as if there's a conspiracy between people who think the rich got their money from God, and bleeding hearts who think the poor are so beaten down that they could never in a million years lift themselves up.This movie ought to be shown to young people everywhere on earth. It teaches the lesson that there is no limit to how high you can rise up ON YOUR OWN.",5,Unique!,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,1615,"['First', 'should', 'say', 'saw', 'film', 'VHS', 'American', 'title', '34', 'Promoter', '34', 'U.K.', 'title', 'what', 'screen', 'had', 'seen', 'once', 'television', 'was', 'struck', 'something', 'unique', 'only', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'how', 'make', 'money', 'other', 'films', 'people', 'just', 'have', 'money', 'find', 'steal', 'someone', 'film', 'money', 'off', 'screen', 'never', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'fantastic', 'way', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'here', 'see', 'Guinness', 'character', 'childhood', 'only', 'son', 'washerwoman', 'end', 'film', 'rich', 'respected', 'mayor', 'city', 'wonder', 'film', 'actually', 'see', 'HOW', 'how', 'could', 'happen', 'reality.Is', ""n't"", 'strange', 'money', 'big', 'part', 'life', 'how', 'make', 'treated', 'dirty', 'secret', 'can', 'see', 'sex', 'act', 'can', 'imagine', 'quite', 'few', 'ca', ""n't"", 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'planets', 'other', 'dimensions', 'never', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'poor', 'can', 'make', 'rich', 'not', 'winning', 'game', 'show', 'lottery', 'idiocy', 'just', 'trick', 'poor', 'staying', 'poor', 'conspiracy', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'rich', 'got', 'money', 'God', 'bleeding', 'hearts', 'who', 'think', 'poor', 'are', 'so', 'beaten', 'down', 'could', 'never', 'million', 'years', 'lift', 'up.This', 'movie', 'ought', 'be', 'shown', 'young', 'people', 'everywhere', 'earth', 'lesson', 'limit', 'how', 'high', 'can', 'rise', 'up', 'ON', 'YOUR', 'OWN']",Promoter VHS
