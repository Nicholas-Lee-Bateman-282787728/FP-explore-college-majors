She has been exposed to some spanish since birth but only after this video (and then the series), was she CLEARLY actually SPEAKING spanish, in sentences. I love also, that the host has no particular accent, but speaks in clear and proper spanish. This DVD is a thumbs up. I borrowed it 3x from the library and decided to make it a purchase. Would recommend.",5,This is awesome.,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,421,"['three', 'year', 'old', 'got', 'absolutely', 'been', 'exposed', 'spanish', 'birth', 'only', 'video', 'then', 'series', 'was', 'CLEARLY', 'actually', 'SPEAKING', 'spanish', 'sentences', 'love', 'also', 'host', 'particular', 'accent', 'clear', 'proper', 'spanish', 'DVD', 'thumbs', 'up', 'borrowed', '3x', 'library', 'decided', 'make', 'purchase', 'Would', 'recommend']",N/A

Designed for ages 1-5, Los Animales is perfect for the whole family!"". They are completely misleading to say the least. It's very difficult for an adult to learn Spanish this way. No Spanish or English words are displayed. In many scenes, we don't know what they are speaking. Many spoken sentences are too long for a beginner to repeat. None of my adult family members can learn from this DVD.The songs are interesting though.There are much better DVDs that teaches Spanish such as Galloping Minds - Preschooler Learns Spanish, and Little Pim DVDs.

1071222,A2QX49LS3Y3ANI,B000PHG0NY,Dienne,"[2, 2]","The age range indicated for this video is 1-5.  I think 5 might be stretching it.  It is very definitely toddler oriented - Spanish for the Barney set.  If you're just starting to introduce your child to Spanish and/or if your child is very young, this is a good Whistelfritz video to start with.  It's much easier to comprehend than the other videos (which themselves are pretty easy to comprehend), because it's like speaking to a toddler.As its title suggests, this video is exclusively devoted to animals.  Other Whistlefritz videos have different segments which focus on different things, but this one is all animals.  We start with just a dog.  Then two dogs.  Then three.  And finally four.  Whoops, make that three dogs and a cat.  Slowly we add new animals - fish, rat, elephant, burro, cow, chicken, rooster, pig and horse.  Each time a new animal is introduced we get a review of the other animals.  (""Is this a dog?""  ""No!"" ""Is this a cat?""  ""No!""  Etc.)  The video also focuses on animal sounds.  At the end of the video we learn a little bit about the farm and there is a clip of live horses, but most of the video uses puppets.  And like all Whistlefritz videos, the colors are bright and attractive and Maria is bubbly and engaging.This video has fewer songs than other Whistlefritz videos and one of them is sung by Maria herself, whose voice sounds a bit like a teenage boy who is just entering puberty.  None of the songs are quite as catchy as other Whistlefritz videos, but they're still fun.My biggest complaint with all the Whistlefritz videos is how short they are, especially for the money.  This one is particularly short - approximately 25 minutes.  That's a pretty good length for a toddler video, but I wish they would include multiple episodes on one video.Overall, it's a good basic introduction to Spanish for beginners and very young children and a worthy addition to the Whistlefritz collection.",4,Very basic for very young kids,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,1929,"['age', 'range', 'indicated', 'video', '1-5', 'think', '5', 'might', 'be', 'stretching', 'very', 'definitely', 'toddler', 'oriented', 'Spanish', 'Barney', 'set', ""'re"", 'just', 'starting', 'introduce', 'child', 'Spanish', 'and/or', 'child', 'very', 'young', 'good', 'Whistelfritz', 'video', 'start', 'much', 'easier', 'comprehend', 'other', 'videos', 'are', 'pretty', 'easy', 'comprehend', 'speaking', 'toddler.As', 'title', 'video', 'exclusively', 'devoted', 'animals', 'Other', 'Whistlefritz', 'videos', 'have', 'different', 'segments', 'focus', 'different', 'things', 'one', 'animals', 'start', 'just', 'dog', 'Then', 'two', 'dogs', 'Then', 'three', 'finally', 'four', 'Whoops', 'make', 'three', 'dogs', 'cat', 'Slowly', 'add', 'new', 'animals', 'fish', 'rat', 'elephant', 'burro', 'cow', 'chicken', 'rooster', 'pig', 'horse', 'time', 'new', 'animal', 'introduced', 'get', 'review', 'other', 'animals', 'dog', 'cat', 'Etc', 'video', 'also', 'animal', 'sounds', 'end', 'video', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'farm', 'clip', 'live', 'horses', 'most', 'video', 'puppets', 'Whistlefritz', 'videos', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'attractive', 'Maria', 'bubbly', 'engaging.This', 'video', 'fewer', 'songs', 'other', 'Whistlefritz', 'videos', 'one', 'sung', 'Maria', 'voice', 'bit', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'entering', 'puberty', 'None', 'songs', 'are', 'quite', 'as', 'catchy', 'other', 'Whistlefritz', 'videos', ""'re"", 'still', 'fun.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Whistlefritz', 'videos', 'how', 'short', 'are', 'especially', 'money', 'one', 'particularly', 'short', 'approximately', '25', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'good', 'length', 'toddler', 'video', 'wish', 'would', 'include', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'one', 'video.Overall', 'good', 'basic', 'introduction', 'Spanish', 'beginners', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Whistlefritz', 'collection']",N/A

I researched a number of different Spanish for kids educational movies before selecting this one, and I have not been disappointed. This uses immersion as opposed to translation, meaning the entire movie is in Spanish.""The Animals"" DVD uses witty child humor to engage the kids in the program.

The production values were fairly low -- puppets instead of real animals, etc. But the minute my boy saw it, I changed my mind. He loves this video! He has no background in Spanish, yet he watches it again and again. He asks to hear the song ""Los Pollitos Dicen"" several times every time we watch it. He really interacts with the video, and seems to like the friendly and cheerful ""hostess,"" Sara Jerez. I know a little high school Spanish, but for parents who don't know any at all, there's a pamphlet included that has translations of every word of the video, and includes lyrics to all the songs (some traditional and some written for the DVD).I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants their toddler to get an enjoyable introduction to another language.
