You don't have to be a child to enjoy a show like this. It's filled with adventure, excitement, and full of funny stuff. It can also teach about friendship. So you'd be a fool not to buy this movie.",5,It's about time!,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,330,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'rest', 'episodes', 'come', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'used', 'watch', 'show', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'child', 'enjoy', 'show', 'filled', 'adventure', 'excitement', 'full', 'funny', 'stuff', 'can', 'also', 'teach', 'friendship', ""'d"", 'be', 'fool', 'not', 'buy', 'movie']","TaleSpin, Volume 3"

It is the 11 episode leftovers from the previously released volume 1 and volume 2. It doesn't matter. I still have a crush on Rebecca Cunningham-- she appeals to me. These are not the strongest episodes. Those are on volume 1. Yet I still love the stories, drawings, and characters of Cape Suzette. Reminds me of The Rocketeer, which Disney made at the same time. There are many references to Indiana Jones, but I prefer TaleSpin over Indiana Jones.
