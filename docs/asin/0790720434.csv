She experiments to find secret passageways (all Gothics are full of secret passageways) but end up finding a secret garden instead. The housekeeper (Maggie Smith does everything she can to limit the child's actions but to no avail, as the girl has a mind of her own.)The sad tale behind the garden is that the mistress of the manor died giving birth to an invalid child after falling out of the garden swing.  The garden is then shut up and forgotten along with the memory of the dead wife.Mary, Kate Moberly plays a dynamic little girl who continues to explore until she discovers a groaning, crying sound in the night which turns out to be a bedridden cousin.  This cousin has been kept bedridden in error by the housekeeper who has misdiagnosed his condition to be something far more serious than it truly is.Heyden Prowse could plays the crippled male cousin.  Mary takes Colin(Heyden) out of doors and eventually he walks.  The story is very predictable but nevertheless, done is such a way that it appear new.This author knows how to tell a tale to children even if you can predict the outcome.

87498,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790720434,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Disney had a field day with these remakes of classic children's movies targeted at little girls, and they actually hit quite a few home runs.  `The Secret Garden' was one of them.  The beauty of this particular film is that it really captures the spirit and heart of adolescence while tackling the important and thematic issues such as death, loss and love in a way that never feels overwhelming yet never feels slight.  It is a thin line, and this film treds it rather remarkably.The story revolves around a young orphaned girl named Mary who is sent to live with her Uncle after an earthquake in India kills her parents.  Her Uncle, depressed and mourning the loss of his wife, leaves her pretty much unattended while he travels.  So, she is left in the care of the stern Mrs. Medlock.  After disobeying orders to keep her nose where it belongs so-to-speak, Mary winds up stumbling across her Uncle's crippled son, who shares Mary's stubborn and spoiled demeanor.  The children share a common thread, for they are both in many ways orphans.  While young Colin has only suffered the death of his mother, his father's continued absence has left him bitter and repressed, thrusting his inner turmoil at the world through temper tantrums and demands.  With the help of a young maid and her charming brother, Mary and Colin begin to mend their broken hearts and souls by visiting an enchanting garden that contains the spirit (in a more figurative way) of Colin's departed mother.The themes here are beautifully etched into every frame, and the technical merits here also help to elevate the film.  The score is enchanting, to say the least, and the performances by the entire cast, especially the children, are hugely effective.  Young Kate Maberly is astonishing as Mary, and Heydon Prowse pretty much steals the whole show as the emotionally, and physically crippled Master Colin.Not just a story for little girls, `The Secret Garden' is a touching and moving film for the entire family, young and old, and proves that the magic of the movies is still very much alive and can be found in the most unexpected of places.  A Disney movie centered on yet another orphaned girl may not seem like the most likely place to find such subtle life lessons and yet Polish director Agniesza Holland beautifully pulls back and delivers a soft and sincere look at adolescence with enough restraint to create an authentic atmosphere.",5,A beautiful spirit...,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,2418,"['Disney', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'remakes', 'classic', 'children', 'movies', 'targeted', 'little', 'girls', 'actually', 'hit', 'quite', 'few', 'home', 'runs', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'was', 'one', 'beauty', 'particular', 'film', 'really', 'spirit', 'heart', 'adolescence', 'tackling', 'important', 'thematic', 'issues', 'such', 'death', 'loss', 'love', 'way', 'never', 'feels', 'overwhelming', 'yet', 'never', 'feels', 'slight', 'thin', 'line', 'film', 'rather', 'remarkably.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'young', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'named', 'Mary', 'who', 'sent', 'live', 'Uncle', 'earthquake', 'India', 'parents', 'Uncle', 'depressed', 'mourning', 'loss', 'wife', 'pretty', 'much', 'unattended', 'So', 'left', 'care', 'stern', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'disobeying', 'orders', 'keep', 'nose', 'where', 'so-to-speak', 'Mary', 'up', 'stumbling', 'Uncle', 'crippled', 'son', 'who', 'shares', 'Mary', 'stubborn', 'spoiled', 'demeanor', 'children', 'share', 'common', 'thread', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'orphans', 'young', 'Colin', 'only', 'suffered', 'death', 'mother', 'father', 'continued', 'absence', 'left', 'bitter', 'repressed', 'thrusting', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'world', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'demands', 'help', 'young', 'maid', 'charming', 'brother', 'Mary', 'Colin', 'begin', 'mend', 'broken', 'hearts', 'souls', 'visiting', 'enchanting', 'garden', 'spirit', 'more', 'figurative', 'way', 'Colin', 'departed', 'mother.The', 'themes', 'here', 'are', 'beautifully', 'etched', 'frame', 'technical', 'merits', 'here', 'also', 'help', 'elevate', 'film', 'score', 'enchanting', 'say', 'least', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'especially', 'children', 'are', 'hugely', 'effective', 'Young', 'Kate', 'Maberly', 'astonishing', 'Mary', 'Heydon', 'Prowse', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'whole', 'show', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'crippled', 'Master', 'Colin.Not', 'just', 'story', 'little', 'girls', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'touching', 'moving', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'young', 'old', 'magic', 'movies', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'most', 'unexpected', 'places', 'Disney', 'movie', 'centered', 'yet', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'most', 'likely', 'place', 'find', 'such', 'subtle', 'life', 'lessons', 'yet', 'Polish', 'director', 'Agniesza', 'Holland', 'beautifully', 'back', 'soft', 'sincere', 'look', 'adolescence', 'enough', 'restraint', 'create', 'authentic', 'atmosphere']",N/A
87499,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,0790720434,Andrew Raker,"[7, 11]","Below I compare and contrast the three color adaptations.1. The 1975 adaptation BBCThis adaptation is very low budgeted, and it shows in the picture quality, which is painful even if you are used to BBC 4.3 aspect ratio films. This said, the film is quite good in every other way if loyalty in plot is important to you. For example, Mr. Archibald Craven, Ben W., Martha, Martha's mother, etc. are given larger roles in this adaptation than in the 1987 and 1993 adaptations. Furthermore, a considerably amount of the dialogue is taken directly from the novel. Therefore, this adaptation is much less 'sound bites' and allows for the development of Mary, Dickon, and Collin's characters.The acting is also considerably better than the 1987 adaptation and better than the 1993 adaptation. [Unfortunately, with child actors of probably 10 or 11 years of age who have memorize a large amount of script, errors will be evident.]Yet, the 1975 adaptation is the best adaptation in my opinion. It is neither too mystical (1993) nor too gothic (1987). I just is the story of a family and a garden that brings them together.2. The 1987 adaptation HallmarkAlthough I know many individuals despise this adaptation, I enjoyed it for a change. Yes, the acting is not perfect and the accents are horrible. Yes, the ending is pathetic and quite changed from the novel. Yes, Dickon (as an adult) dies in World War II. Yet, when one considers what the film was trying to achieve (i.e. change the theme from a children's story to a social critique of problems in society), it does an effective job. The film is a little too gothic (in the Victorian literature definition -i.e. 'ghosts' and long, dark corridors), yet I did not think the gothic harmed the story but rather created a sense of anticipation.Again, if you want a loyal adaptation, I would urge the the 1975 adaptation. However, if you are tired of watching the 1975 adaptation and want to see a change, this 1987 adaptation is a better choice than the 1993 adaptation.3. The 1993 adaptation Time WarnerI disliked this adaptation. My first problem was that Mary's parents were killed in an earthquake rather than a plague. (I am not certain what this proved?). Secondly, the mystical music was annoying as were the inappropriate accents - although of the two, I could tolerate the poor accents much more than the poor music.Additionally, other scenes were also altered. For example, Mary finds the key to the garden in her deceased aunt's bedroom in the shut up wing of the Manor. In the 1975 adaptation (and I think the 1987 adaptation also), Mary finds the key buried with some help from a robin. However, the robin does show Mary where the door to the garden is located.Unfortunately, the other problem I have with this film is that it is centered almost exclusively on Mary's character. Where the 1975 adaptation provides other characters (ex: Martha, Dr. Craven, Sir Archibald Craven, and Martha's mother have with numerous scenes in which Mary does not appear.) In the Warner adaptation, Mary is the focus of nearly every scene.Also, Collin's character was considerably altered into less dictatorial that in the novel the other film adaptations. In fact, at times, Collin appears very childish and timid - terrified of dying and of Mrs. Medlock (rather than bossing Mrs. Medlock, his nurse, and everyone else around). Why Mrs. Medlock and the whole staff of of the Manor had to wear masks when around Collin, I have not a clue? (I forget if everyone wearing a mask was in the novel or not, but it makes no sense in this film adaptation.)However, the film does have some positives. The Manor house is considerably larger than in the 1975 adaptation and larger than the 1987 adaptation, and therefore, it becomes more believable that Mary could have mistaken Collin's crying for the wind, rather than know outrightly that it was someone crying.",3,Contrast of the three adaptations.,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,3889,"['compare', 'contrast', 'three', 'color', 'adaptations.1', '1975', 'adaptation', 'BBCThis', 'adaptation', 'very', 'low', 'budgeted', 'picture', 'quality', 'painful', 'even', 'are', 'used', 'BBC', '4.3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'films', 'said', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'other', 'way', 'loyalty', 'plot', 'important', 'example', 'Mr.', 'Archibald', 'Craven', 'Ben', 'W.', 'Martha', 'Martha', 'mother', 'etc', 'are', 'given', 'larger', 'roles', 'adaptation', '1987', '1993', 'adaptations', 'Furthermore', 'considerably', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'taken', 'directly', 'novel', 'Therefore', 'adaptation', 'much', 'less', ""'sound"", 'bites', 'allows', 'development', 'Mary', 'Dickon', 'Collin', 'characters.The', 'acting', 'also', 'considerably', 'better', '1987', 'adaptation', 'better', '1993', 'adaptation', '[', 'Unfortunately', 'child', 'actors', 'probably', '10', '11', 'years', 'age', 'who', 'have', 'memorize', 'large', 'amount', 'script', 'errors', 'will', 'be', 'evident', ']', 'Yet', '1975', 'adaptation', 'best', 'adaptation', 'opinion', 'too', 'mystical', '1993', 'too', 'gothic', '1987', 'just', 'story', 'family', 'garden', 'together.2', '1987', 'adaptation', 'HallmarkAlthough', 'know', 'many', 'individuals', 'despise', 'adaptation', 'enjoyed', 'change', 'Yes', 'acting', 'not', 'perfect', 'accents', 'are', 'horrible', 'Yes', 'ending', 'pathetic', 'quite', 'changed', 'novel', 'Yes', 'Dickon', 'adult', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'when', 'one', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'achieve', 'i.e', 'change', 'theme', 'children', 'story', 'social', 'critique', 'problems', 'society', 'effective', 'job', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'gothic', 'Victorian', 'literature', 'definition', '-i.e', ""'ghosts"", 'long', 'dark', 'corridors', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'gothic', 'harmed', 'story', 'rather', 'created', 'sense', 'anticipation.Again', 'want', 'loyal', 'adaptation', 'would', 'urge', '1975', 'adaptation', 'However', 'are', 'tired', 'watching', '1975', 'adaptation', 'want', 'see', 'change', '1987', 'adaptation', 'better', 'choice', '1993', 'adaptation.3', '1993', 'adaptation', 'Time', 'WarnerI', 'disliked', 'adaptation', 'first', 'problem', 'was', 'Mary', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'earthquake', 'rather', 'plague', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'proved', 'Secondly', 'mystical', 'music', 'was', 'annoying', 'were', 'inappropriate', 'accents', 'two', 'could', 'tolerate', 'poor', 'accents', 'much', 'more', 'poor', 'music.Additionally', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'altered', 'example', 'Mary', 'key', 'garden', 'deceased', 'aunt', 'bedroom', 'shut', 'up', 'wing', 'Manor', '1975', 'adaptation', 'think', '1987', 'adaptation', 'also', 'Mary', 'key', 'buried', 'help', 'robin', 'However', 'robin', 'show', 'Mary', 'where', 'door', 'garden', 'located.Unfortunately', 'other', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'centered', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Mary', 'character', 'Where', '1975', 'adaptation', 'other', 'characters', 'ex', 'Martha', 'Dr.', 'Craven', 'Sir', 'Archibald', 'Craven', 'Martha', 'mother', 'have', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'Mary', 'not', 'appear', 'Warner', 'adaptation', 'Mary', 'focus', 'nearly', 'scene.Also', 'Collin', 'character', 'was', 'considerably', 'altered', 'less', 'dictatorial', 'novel', 'other', 'film', 'adaptations', 'fact', 'times', 'Collin', 'very', 'childish', 'timid', 'terrified', 'dying', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'rather', 'bossing', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'nurse', 'everyone', 'else', 'Why', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'whole', 'staff', 'Manor', 'had', 'wear', 'masks', 'when', 'Collin', 'have', 'not', 'clue', 'forget', 'everyone', 'wearing', 'mask', 'was', 'novel', 'not', 'sense', 'film', 'adaptation', 'However', 'film', 'have', 'positives', 'Manor', 'house', 'considerably', 'larger', '1975', 'adaptation', 'larger', '1987', 'adaptation', 'therefore', 'more', 'believable', 'Mary', 'could', 'have', 'mistaken', 'Collin', 'crying', 'wind', 'rather', 'know', 'outrightly', 'was', 'someone', 'crying']",N/A

87523,A39U50ZJPWZ9P3,0790720434,Darrell,"[2, 2]","By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.comThe best by far of any amazon.com reviews of The Secret Garden (no matter which version you like best) was made by Lloyd Newell September 22, 2013 on the Church of the Air, Music and the Spoken Word broadcast from Temple Square in Salt lake City, Utah. This was Newell's review:Over a hundred years ago, Frances Hodgson Burnett wrote The Secret Garden, an enchanting novel about a young girl, Mary, who is orphaned during a cholera outbreak and sent away to live with relatives she has never met. Her childhood has been filled with loneliness and neglect, but Mary's personality begins to blossom as she and a young gardener bring new life to an old, neglected garden.Though the garden seems to be nearly dead, the gardener helps Mary see the dormant life in it, which together they nurture to full bloom. The garden becomes a place of healing not only for Mary but also for others who are suffering--including her sickly cousin and her sorrowing uncle.It is a reaffirming, hopeful message of the resilience of life--that people can change, miracles can happen, and everyone's story can have a happy ending.In a sense, we each have a secret garden that needs tending. It might be a relationship that needs a little extra care, a decision that needs to be made, a hope or a wish or a dream that needs some nurturing. Our garden may seem to be filled with weeds and thorns, but it is also filled with the potential to become lush and fragrant and beautiful. Even when life seems dark and hopeless, with some patient care and attention, things can always change for the better.In the Broadway adaptation of The Secret Garden, a friendly chambermaid uplifts Mary during a moment of discouragement with this inspiring message:When you see the storm is coming,See the lightning part the skies,It's too late to run--There's terror in your eyes!What you do then is rememberThis old thing you heard me say:""It's the storm, not you,That's bound to blow away."" . . .Hold on, Hold on.The night will soon be by.Hold onUntil there's nothing left to try.Child, hold on.There are angels on the way!Hold on and hear them say, ""Child, Oh, child!"" . . .Hold on!See all of my Reviews.

87527,A18U60VSS8XHMK,0790720434,Dirk,"[24, 25]","To be honest, I remember seeing previews of this movie way back when it came out (in 1993) and thinking to myself, ""WHY would anyone want to see such a film; more importantly, WHY would anyone make it?"" Well, about five years later it appeared on TV one night when I was bored. I decided to give it a try, fully expecting to turn it off within 20 minutes or so. WOW -- was I ever wrong!What I saw was beautiful and captivating, artistic and entrancing -- film-making of the highest order. ""The Secret Garden"" is a movie of such high artistic quality that it ranks up there with the hallowed ""Apocalypse Now"" (although, of course, these two flicks inhabit two opposite ends of the thematic spectrum). It's no wonder that Francis Ford Coppola had his hand in  both of these pics -- he was the director of ""Apocalypse Now"" (duh) and the executive producer of ""The Secret Garden.""Anyway, the cinematography is breathtaking and the music is wondrously outstanding.To be brief, the story's about a young spoilied English girl, orphaned in India, who comes home to live on her uncle's vast estate in the early 1900's. The girl, Mary, finds herself trapped in a mysterious, colossal manor -- almost a castle -- tyranically managed by a life-stifling witch, Mrs. Medlock, in the frequent absence of her uncle, Lord Cravin. Because Mary is highly intelligent, independant and sly she is easily able to reconnoiter the manor and learn its forbidding secrets. The biggest secret is that her aunt died in childbirth about ten years before, but her son, Colin, still lives there, albeit confined to a bed, sickly and unable to walk. Her uncle evidently never healed from this heartbreak and this explains his frequent absences.Mary finds a secret garden in her explorations, a hidden garden closed up and neglected since her aunt's death. After meeting the sickly and sad Colin, Mary inevitably finds a way to sneak him into the beautiful garden along with her pal Dickon. She instinctively senses that Colin isn't as sick as everyone is convinced he is; she knows the best thing for Colin would be to get him out of the dreary castle and the oppressive clutches of Mrs. Medlock. Mary and her secret garden are the keys to restoring health, life and freedom to Colin, Lord Cravin and the gloomy manor.""The Secret Garden"" is kind of a 1990's version of the outstanding ""Pollyanna"" with Hayley Mills (1960). Both pics involve a young girl restoring a spirit of joy and liberty to a lifeless community. The difference is that Mary is not even remotely the ""glad girl"" that Pollyanna is. (In fact, look for the hilarious line from the old man gardener who responds to Mary's puzzlement concerning her lack of friends).""The Secret Garden"" is no doubt labled a ""children's film;"" this is a shame because it so transcends such a limiting category. It is a beautiful work of wonder and deep mystery which can be enjoyed by people of all ages -- children and adults.

87533,A30B87MBCLEZ07,0790720434,EC,"[1, 2]","A lovely adaptation of the classic children's novel. The Secret Garden has been a favorite book of mine since I was a child and this movie is a practically perfect portrayal of the story. The script took only a few liberties beyond the original story, primarily how Mary's parents die. In the movie, they die in an earthquake, in the book they die of a Cholera outbreak in India. The book's version gives a lot of insight into who Mary is, and where she comes from, but would probably taken up too much screen time to tell it all.The movie embellishes a little bit from the book regarding Mary, Dicken, and Colin's relationship. It adds a few vignettes that show how attached Colin is to Mary, in almost a possessive way, which certainly fits with Colin's character, who is not used to people nor sharing. There's a great scene that shows Colin getting quite jealous when he notices that Mary and Dicken seem to have a bit of a crush on each other. It's really quite sweet, and I actually wouldn't have minded that being written into the book.I highly recommend this movie for anyone of any age. It's a sweet, uplifting story that anyone can relate to: feeling not wanted or afraid of life and finding in yourself that you can rise above that, even if it's a small way, such as bringing life back to an abandoned garden. The theme of renewal of life and happiness will not be lost on adults and children will discover new growth and wonder right along with Mary, Colin, and Dicken.For parents, PLEASE read the book to your kids first. It will make their experience watching the movie so much more enjoyable as they see their imagination brought to life on the screen. The movie did bring some new things for me, seeing the moors and hearing the Welsh accents were something I could not have fully imagined as a kid, and when I re-read the book later, it brought new life to how I imagined the story.It's hard to find movie's that are really kid friendly in theaters. I've been extremely disappointed in a number of animated and family films in the last few years, that bring in rude language and sexual overtones that is ridiculously inappropriate for movies marketed to young children. You won't find one bit of that in the Secret Garden. It's movie with a good moral story that parent's can feel good about showing to their children.

87536,A2GCSJJSTHZVIN,0790720434,Evan Stern,"[18, 20]","When writing or directing a children's film, far too often people find it necessary to dumb down work in order to cater to a young audience. Fortunately this is not the case with The Secret Garden, a film in which  the story it presents is well crafted and intelligent, and appealing to  both young and old audiences. In many ways the production could have gone  dreadfully wrong. One can see where in the hands of a less talented writer  or director the story could have become melodramatic, overly sentimental,  or comical, yet The Secret Garden is a beautifully executed picture that  rings true as a result of its naturalistic storytelling. Much of this is  due to the credit of its fine cast. Frequently, child actors are employed  to act &quot;cute&quot; onscreen, but there is not a young actor in this  movie who does not give a performance of great depth. In fact, it can  easily be argued that each one of these children exhibit greater skill than  many adults currently working in the realm of cinema. But what is at the  heart of The Secret Garden is a beautiful lyrical story about love,  childhood, growth, and healing. There are moments in the film that are so  genuinely touching the viewer's heart almost stops. Such is the case of the  scene in which the bedridden Collin is escorted outside of his house and  his eyes open to see spread before him his mother's beautiful garden.

And yes, I have read the book; I watched this movie the very same day I finished the book, in fact, and relished both treasures. I stayed up till four am watching the film (in spite of the fact I had school the next day) and it was worth it!The heroine, Mary, is truly a diverse character; in the beginning of the story, she is spoiled and snobbish, cared for by her Indian nursemaids and neglected by her socialite parents. When her parents die in a tragic accident, however, Mary is sent from the exotic heat of India to the coldness of England, where she is again almost totally ignored by her uncle and his busy servants. Left on her own to wonder the grounds as she chooses, Mary soon comes across many secrets that have long lay buried and sets about unearthing them. It is during her endeavors of discovery that she slowly awakens two lush gardens: one within the mansion's grounds, and another deep in her heart.This story is largely about healing and awakening; the spring glory of the secret garden and the touching spiritual healing of Mary and her family are equally heart-jerking and brought tears to my eyes. Many have complained about inaccuracy to the book, but with a few minor exceptions, I must say I disagree. Any changes were small and I personally think Burnett would have been proud of this film. The scenery, casting, and music are flawless; the grounds of Mary's uncle's huge estate go from cold to vibrantly breathtaking in wonderful symbolism. The child who plays Mary is a classicaly lovely brunette who brings the perfect mixture of high-class snobbery, stubborness, and ultimate softness to her character; Maggie Smith is also wonderful in her stiff but not unlikeable role as head housekeeper, and no one could have found a better actor for the thin and isolated Colin. And the music: if I hadn't already lost the battle with tears, I would have as soon as Linda Ronstadt's haunting voice began singing when the credits rolled. The music throughout is wonderful and adds to the story's beauty.This movie is refreshing, healing, and beautiful.

87570,A2SARNTK8O6PL4,0790720434,K. Alphs,"[3, 6]","Originally, I had high hopes for this movie version of the beloved Frances Hodgson Burnett classic.Directed by Agnieska Holland, who directed the award winning ""Europa, Europa,"" screenplay by Caroline Thompson, whose credits include ""Edward Scissorhands"", musical score composed by Zbigniew Preisner, with performances by John Lynch, Kate Maberly and the legendary, Dame Maggie Smith this movie had all of the makings of a film classic. However, my hopes were dashed to pieces, like a fine crystal vase thrown against a wall. The main fault of the film is the screenplay, authored by Caroline Thompson. Instead of following Burnett's classic storyline, it appears the author chose to give her own interpretation of the hidden meaning of the garden and those it influences. The mood of the movie has a dark, ominous tone, with the focus fixated on the mysticism and healing power of the garden. Incidentally, this movie was filmed in the early 1990's when the ""New Age"" movement was gaining momentum and becoming fashionable in the West. Hence, elements of New Age theology are woven throughout the film, which diverts from Hodgson's original intent of exploring healing through Mary Baker Eddy's Christian Science theories. I will credit Agnieska Holland with brilliant direction, Zbigniew Preisner with a memorable musical score and Roger Deakins and Jerzy Zielinksi with amazing cinematography.In lieu of this movie version, I recommend the Hallmark Hall of Fame version. The Hallmark Hall of Fame movie was filmed on location in Yorkshire at Highclere Castle, the present location for Julian Fellowes hit ""Downtown Abbey.""

I just attempted to walk through the room where my kids were watching this movie.  But I never made it to the other side.  I happened in on the part where Mary is following the little bird through a maze of shrubbery.  The visual is stunning enough, but what really makes this version work is the soundtrack.  In this particular part, there is a very gusty, cold, damp wind blowing against the grey and dark green shrubbery, and in the background, behind the swishing of the leaves and the twittering of this little bird comes a piano and French horn duet that absolutely fascinated me with it's solemn, haunting mellowness.It's hard to describe how powerfully the soundtrack melds into the visuals in this version of the classic children's book.  Usually, the soundtrack provides an underpinning for the visuals and tries not to get in the way of the story or characters.  But in this rendition, the soundtrack provides at least fully half of the impact. Needless to say, I was stuck there for the rest of the movie and have watched it again numerous times - most often alone.I've not seen the other (1987) version, but of the bad reviews that it gets I can tell you there is none of that here aside from the normal English snobbery.  My only hesitation is that the movie dabbled ever, EVER, so slightly on the occult (not enough to be offensive to most religious people), until going off the deep end briefly..., BRIEFLY..., in a short, but blatant seance with strong Celtic/Wiccan leanings.  It was very brief, and it goes way past the understanding of young kids who may be watching.  I could fairly easily edit it out, but unfortunately, the seance is a key turning point that makes the rest of the plot make sense.In writing this review, I may be guilty of reminiscing.  Perhaps the stunning visuals, scenery, and mood are only appealing to me because I was born and raised for most of my childhood in England, in settings very much like this.  But the soundtrack is universal.  Buy this movie, and then go buy it's soundtrack CD.  I recommend this movie primarily for adults - not due to the content, but because the story is dark and moody, and children will most likely be bored by it.If you are prone to tears, keep a box of tissues nearby.

When Mary begins exploring the manor, she discovers not only a secret garden but also a secret cousin!This is a beautifully-filmed children's story about the power of friendship and overcoming adversity.  I wasn't familiar with the 1911 book (although I want to read it now), so I expected something awful to happen to the garden or the children, but only good things happen, so it's ideal for kids of all ages.The Yorkshire location is lovely and the acting is uniformly wonderful.

Her neglectful parents die in a massive earth quake and she has to go to England to live with her uncle.Her arrival in less then eventful as the other orphans make fun of her and nobody meets her on the docks.  She travels to the middle of nowhere and learns her new home is as large as a castle and it's her prison.  Her uncle does not want to meet her.  Her aunt is dead and to her surprise she learns she was the twin sister of her mother.  The cold and stern house keeper Mrs. Medlock aptly played by Maggie Smith orders her to stay in her room.She finally makes a friend who is a maid named Martha who is kind hearted and takes Mary's abuse for the most part in stride.  Poor Mary doesn't even know how to dress herself but Martha does help her.  When Mary later expresses a desire to play with somebody; Martha mentions her brother Dikon.  They eventually meet and learn they share the same love of gardening.  Dikon like his sister is a gentle soul and you see the affect they have on Mary who starts to change as she has friends.Another discovery is the unknown cousin Colin.  A bedridden sickly and very spoiled child.  Born after the death of his mother; he becomes a reminder of to his father who can't deal with the death of his wife and the assumed pending death of his son.  Colin is not likable and overly spoiled he starts to change when Mary stands up to his ways.  As she comments that nobody sickly would scream as much as he does.  Eventually; they start making it out to the secret garden and Colin starts to get healthy as he gets air and exercise.Mary after facing death brought life to a dead household and in turn found a home that wanted her.This is a great story and a fun movie.

If you're an adult looking for a change of pace in your movie viewing, this is an excellent place to start.The characters in this movie are almost all pegged to some sort of extreme mood or behavior: the angry Miss from India who has just lost the parents who didn't love her to begin with; the ""Type A"" housekeeper striding the halls of the Gothic mansion, keys jangling from her belt like a jail warden; the mysterious hermit uncle whose life ended the day his wife died; the know-it-all hypochondriac boy who has never been out of his bedroom; the almost psychopathically cheerful chambermaid who has agreed to dress the demanding ""I Never Dress Myself!"" little girl.The mansion is gloomy, spooky, far too big for its oft-absent owner, and stuck by itself in the middle of the lonely, wind-and-rain-swept English moors. You wonder how on Earth the abandoned little girl is ever going to find a secret garden in this forsaken, dysfunctional environment. But she does. A robin as full of personality and smarts as any of the people in this film shows her the way.The casting of this movie was superb. That they found a little girl who could so convincingly render the angry, puffy, emotionally abused facial expressions of the early scenes and later transform herself into the cherub of the secret garden is a marvel. The sickly boy's temper tantrums are top-notch and the hermit uncle's weirdly handsome decline into self-ruin is perfect. Maggie Smith as the housekeeper is the ultimate in self-righteous control freaks . . . and only the business-like Maggie Smith could properly pull off her epiphany at the end without appearing saccharine or hypocritical.",5,Adults looking for magic should grab this one,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,1769,"['daughter', 'almost', '21', 'longer', 'home', 'review', 'purely', 'adult', 'point', 'view', ""'re"", 'adult', 'looking', 'change', 'pace', 'movie', 'viewing', 'excellent', 'place', 'start.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'almost', 'pegged', 'sort', 'extreme', 'mood', 'behavior', 'angry', 'Miss', 'India', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'parents', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'begin', 'Type', 'housekeeper', 'striding', 'halls', 'Gothic', 'mansion', 'keys', 'jangling', 'belt', 'jail', 'warden', 'mysterious', 'hermit', 'uncle', 'life', 'ended', 'day', 'wife', 'died', 'know-it-all', 'hypochondriac', 'boy', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'bedroom', 'almost', 'psychopathically', 'cheerful', 'chambermaid', 'who', 'agreed', 'dress', 'demanding', 'Never', 'Dress', 'little', 'girl.The', 'mansion', 'gloomy', 'spooky', 'far', 'too', 'big', 'oft-absent', 'owner', 'stuck', 'middle', 'lonely', 'wind-and-rain-swept', 'English', 'moors', 'wonder', 'how', 'Earth', 'abandoned', 'little', 'girl', 'ever', 'going', 'find', 'secret', 'garden', 'forsaken', 'dysfunctional', 'environment', 'A', 'robin', 'full', 'personality', 'smarts', 'people', 'film', 'way.The', 'casting', 'movie', 'was', 'superb', 'found', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'could', 'so', 'convincingly', 'render', 'angry', 'puffy', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'facial', 'expressions', 'early', 'scenes', 'later', 'transform', 'cherub', 'secret', 'garden', 'marvel', 'sickly', 'boy', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'are', 'top-notch', 'hermit', 'uncle', 'weirdly', 'handsome', 'decline', 'self-ruin', 'perfect', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'housekeeper', 'ultimate', 'self-righteous', 'control', 'freaks', 'only', 'business-like', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'could', 'properly', 'pull', 'off', 'epiphany', 'end', 'appearing', 'saccharine', 'hypocritical']",N/A

The other child actors in the movie are also exceptionally good actors, and they bring their characters to vivid life on the screen.  Among the adults, Maggie Smith makes an impressive Mrs. Metlock, who is the housekeeper.The movie is about Mary finding a closed-down garden which belonged to her aunt, who died in an accident ten years before Mary came to live on the estate.  She begins to bring the garden back to life by caring for the plants.  Then she stumbles upon Colin, her uncle's son, who is a hypochondriac convinced that he is going to die young.  Mary convinces the boy to join her in the secret garden, where they tend the plants together.  Colin slowly grows stronger.  They are joined by a second boy, Dickon, who has a gift with animals and is always in the company of animal friends.  These three are inseparable.  Mary slowly becomes a better person by helping others, and Colin gives up his unnatural fears of death and disease as he grows healthy and strong.

The acting is  superior and the setting more realistic.  If someone could take the best  qualities of both movies and put them into one, to me that would be the  perfect Secret Garden movie.The 1987 version taught lessons more  easily to younger children, while this newer one will be enjoyed more by  older children and adults.  Colin's father (played by John Lynch) is a much  more human portrayal.  We can truly empathize with his sorrow and Colin's  need to have his father in his life.Mary Lenox was also played in a  more serious light by Kate Maberley.  She portrayed her character extremely  well.  Her story begins in India and we learn she is emotionally neglected,  yet spoiled and physically well taken care of.  She loses her parents in a  massive earthquake. (In the 1987 film it is a plague.)Since she can no  longer stay in India, she is literally shipped off to her uncle.  As she  enters the monstrosity of a castle, we feel she is doomed to be neglected, hated and locked away.  Even Mrs. Medlock (the housekeeper played by Maggie  Smith) is not impressed or sympathetic. Mary is told ""not to go  wandering and poking about."" Mary's natural curiosity compels her to  discover a way out of her room and soon she finds secret doors, staircases, rooms and gardens.At first Martha (a maid) is her only friend, then she  soon learns to like Martha's brother Dikon. He shares her love of  gardening. Martha and Dikon seem to be the only truly happy characters for  the entire first half of the movie. All the actors have wonderful accents  and reveal the positive and negative aspects of each character.When Mary  meets Colin, she has in fact met her match. He is her cousin who is  bedridden, spoiled and annoying! His hysterical screeching makes him most  unlovable. Mary shows Colin that nothing is impossible when you put your  mind to it. She also says something profoundly beautiful at the end of the  story.I found the magic spell casting in this version a bit intense in  comparison to the 1987 version, where dancing around the fire was a fun  time. There is something about the 1987 version which I think appeals more to children, as the characters seem to have a bit more fun overall. This  1993 version has a much better ending. I recommend this version for those  who want a high-quality movie, and the 1987 version for those who can  overlook the acting. I think there is something to be learned from both  movies.~The Rebecca Review",5,Superior acting and a great ending!,965606400,"08 7, 2000",2000,2587,"['watching', '1987', 'version', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'acting', 'decided', 'definitely', 'watch', '1993', 'production', 'acting', 'superior', 'setting', 'more', 'realistic', 'someone', 'could', 'take', 'best', 'qualities', 'movies', 'put', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'movie.The', '1987', 'version', 'taught', 'lessons', 'more', 'easily', 'younger', 'children', 'newer', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'older', 'children', 'adults', 'Colin', 'father', 'played', 'John', 'Lynch', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'portrayal', 'can', 'truly', 'empathize', 'sorrow', 'Colin', 'need', 'have', 'father', 'life.Mary', 'Lenox', 'was', 'also', 'played', 'more', 'serious', 'light', 'Kate', 'Maberley', 'portrayed', 'character', 'extremely', 'well', 'story', 'India', 'learn', 'emotionally', 'neglected', 'yet', 'spoiled', 'physically', 'well', 'taken', 'care', 'parents', 'massive', 'earthquake', '1987', 'film', 'plague', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'stay', 'India', 'literally', 'shipped', 'off', 'uncle', 'monstrosity', 'castle', 'feel', 'doomed', 'be', 'neglected', 'hated', 'locked', 'away', 'Even', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'housekeeper', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'not', 'impressed', 'sympathetic', 'Mary', 'told', 'not', 'go', 'wandering', 'poking', 'about', 'Mary', 'natural', 'curiosity', 'discover', 'way', 'room', 'soon', 'secret', 'doors', 'staircases', 'rooms', 'gardens.At', 'first', 'Martha', 'maid', 'only', 'friend', 'then', 'soon', 'like', 'Martha', 'brother', 'Dikon', 'shares', 'love', 'gardening', 'Martha', 'Dikon', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'truly', 'happy', 'characters', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'actors', 'have', 'wonderful', 'accents', 'reveal', 'positive', 'negative', 'aspects', 'character.When', 'Mary', 'meets', 'Colin', 'fact', 'met', 'match', 'cousin', 'who', 'bedridden', 'spoiled', 'annoying', 'hysterical', 'screeching', 'most', 'unlovable', 'Mary', 'Colin', 'nothing', 'impossible', 'when', 'put', 'mind', 'also', 'something', 'profoundly', 'beautiful', 'end', 'story.I', 'found', 'magic', 'spell', 'casting', 'version', 'bit', 'intense', 'comparison', '1987', 'version', 'where', 'dancing', 'fire', 'was', 'fun', 'time', 'something', '1987', 'version', 'think', 'appeals', 'more', 'children', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'fun', 'overall', '1993', 'version', 'much', 'better', 'ending', 'recommend', 'version', 'who', 'want', 'high-quality', 'movie', '1987', 'version', 'who', 'can', 'overlook', 'acting', 'think', 'something', 'be', 'learned', 'movies.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

87625,A4FX5YCJA630V,0790720434,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[80, 83]","The Secret Garden is without a doubt in my list of top five movies, and will doubtless remain there for the rest of my life. Why it was never a big box-office hit baffles me, as it is nearly perfect in every particular. Adults are just as able to enjoy this movie as their children are (or perhaps even more so!) and though the main character is a girl, the presence of two back-up male characters make this accessible to the reluctant boys.Mary Lennox is a spoilt, bitter ten-year old girl living in India with her neglectful parents. After an earthquake leaves her an orphan however, she is shipped to Misselthwaite Manor, the cold, gloomy home of her uncle, still grieving over the death of his wife (Mary's mother's twin sister). There she is put in to the care of the strict housekeeper Mrs Medlock (admirably preformed by Maggie Smith) and warned not to go poking about in the endless corridors and passageways of the house. However, Mary is used to doing exactly as she pleases, and with the dual finding of a secret passage in her bedroom and the friendship of the cheerful, sweet maid Martha, Mary is soon roaming the grounds of the estate. There she meets Martha's younger brother, the kind-hearted country boy Dickon who can speak to animals and a red-breasted robin that reveals to her a garden hidden behind a wall of ivy...a secret garden.Untangling the mystery of why this sad and beautiful garden is locked away takes Mary back to the tragic past of the house and her uncle - to when her aunt Lilias fell of a swing in the garden just before she gave birth and died, leaving Lord Archibald Craven a broken man, who cannot stand the sight of the Spring, the garden, or his son.This son, Colin Craven is who Mary discovers one night after following the sound of his wailing. Colin is convinced he is going to become a hunchback like his father and die, but with the opening of the secret garden and its rebirth under the care of the three children means that his health gradually restores. Now all the children want is to bring his father home for similar healing, and the only way to do it seems to be to call on magical forces...The three child actors are truely wonderful - Kate Maberly manages to make a spoilt young girl into a likeable, even relatable character and her transformation from a child who couldn't cry even at her parent's deaths to one that breaks down when she witnesses her uncle and his son walk off without her is beautifully created.Heydon Prowse as the impatient, ungrateful Master Colin is another child starved of love, but his obession with death, germs and diseases means he is suffering more in the mind than in body. His frequent fits (or temper tantrums, more likely) means that his mother's garden (that definitly still holds his mother's spirit) can help him also make the change from unloveable and sickly to healthy and strong young boy.However, special credit must be given to Andrew Knott as Dickon Sowerby, who brings a warmth, kindness and mischieviousness to his character that brings joy to the entire movie. He is one of the few 'good-guys' from the very beginning, and in a way the 'Samwise Gamgee' of the movie, not just because he is a kind-hearted simple gardener, but because he is the over-looked hero that ultimately saves the day by just being himself. The fact that the last scene of the movie is of Dickon travelling across the moor on his white pony is a testimony to this.The adult cast also hold up nicely, from Martha to Mrs Medlock, to Ben Weatherstaff to Lord Craven himself. Even the actress that plays both Lilias and Mary's mother has some beautiful scenes, the most poignant being her reaching out to Mary in her dreams, and Lilias's spirit calling to Lord Craven: ""I'm in the garden! With Colin!"" Each performance is outstanding work.The photography, directing and set design of the movie is also beautiful and it boasts a lovely, haunting musical score that includes the song 'Winter Light' that has also become one of my favourites. There are themes galore within the movie whether it be the turn of the seasons, the difference between the restrictions of the upper class and the freedom of the lower class, the relationships between various parents and their children, the joy and furfullment that can be found from simple pleasures, and even life triumphing over death. I even picked up on a subtle love triangle - the scene with Dickon and Mary on the swing together while Colin watches from behind the camera is an intriging one - I kinda wish that the film-makers had developed this plot thread further.All in all, this movie has my absolute highest rating, and is as close to a perfect movie you can possibly get. Watch it, no matter who you are or what age you are.",5,"Not just for kids, and not just for girls...",1039046400,"12 5, 2002",2002,4753,"['Secret', 'Garden', 'doubt', 'list', 'top', 'five', 'movies', 'will', 'doubtless', 'remain', 'there', 'rest', 'life', 'Why', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'box-office', 'hit', 'baffles', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'particular', 'Adults', 'are', 'just', 'able', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'children', 'are', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'main', 'character', 'girl', 'presence', 'two', 'back-up', 'male', 'characters', 'make', 'accessible', 'reluctant', 'boys.Mary', 'Lennox', 'spoilt', 'bitter', 'ten-year', 'old', 'girl', 'living', 'India', 'neglectful', 'parents', 'earthquake', 'orphan', 'however', 'shipped', 'Misselthwaite', 'Manor', 'cold', 'gloomy', 'home', 'uncle', 'still', 'grieving', 'death', 'wife', 'Mary', 'mother', 'twin', 'sister', 'put', 'care', 'strict', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs', 'Medlock', 'admirably', 'preformed', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'warned', 'not', 'go', 'poking', 'about', 'endless', 'corridors', 'passageways', 'house', 'However', 'Mary', 'used', 'doing', 'exactly', 'dual', 'finding', 'secret', 'passage', 'bedroom', 'friendship', 'cheerful', 'sweet', 'maid', 'Martha', 'Mary', 'soon', 'roaming', 'grounds', 'estate', 'Martha', 'younger', 'brother', 'kind-hearted', 'country', 'boy', 'Dickon', 'who', 'can', 'speak', 'animals', 'red-breasted', 'robin', 'garden', 'hidden', 'wall', 'ivy', 'secret', 'garden.Untangling', 'mystery', 'why', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'garden', 'locked', 'away', 'Mary', 'back', 'tragic', 'past', 'house', 'uncle', 'when', 'aunt', 'Lilias', 'fell', 'swing', 'garden', 'just', 'gave', 'birth', 'died', 'leaving', 'Lord', 'Archibald', 'Craven', 'broken', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'sight', 'Spring', 'garden', 'son.This', 'son', 'Colin', 'Craven', 'who', 'Mary', 'one', 'night', 'following', 'sound', 'wailing', 'Colin', 'convinced', 'going', 'become', 'hunchback', 'father', 'die', 'opening', 'secret', 'garden', 'rebirth', 'care', 'three', 'children', 'health', 'gradually', 'Now', 'children', 'want', 'bring', 'father', 'home', 'similar', 'healing', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'be', 'call', 'magical', 'forces', 'three', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'truely', 'wonderful', 'Kate', 'Maberly', 'make', 'spoilt', 'young', 'girl', 'likeable', 'even', 'relatable', 'character', 'transformation', 'child', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'cry', 'even', 'parent', 'deaths', 'one', 'down', 'when', 'uncle', 'son', 'walk', 'beautifully', 'created.Heydon', 'Prowse', 'impatient', 'ungrateful', 'Master', 'Colin', 'child', 'starved', 'love', 'obession', 'death', 'germs', 'diseases', 'suffering', 'more', 'mind', 'body', 'frequent', 'fits', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'more', 'likely', 'mother', 'garden', 'definitly', 'still', 'mother', 'spirit', 'can', 'help', 'also', 'make', 'change', 'unloveable', 'sickly', 'healthy', 'strong', 'young', 'boy.However', 'special', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Andrew', 'Knott', 'Dickon', 'Sowerby', 'who', 'warmth', 'kindness', 'mischieviousness', 'character', 'joy', 'entire', 'movie', 'one', 'few', ""'good-guys"", 'very', 'beginning', 'way', ""'Samwise"", 'Gamgee', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'kind-hearted', 'simple', 'gardener', 'over-looked', 'hero', 'ultimately', 'day', 'just', 'being', 'fact', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'Dickon', 'travelling', 'moor', 'white', 'pony', 'testimony', 'this.The', 'adult', 'cast', 'also', 'hold', 'up', 'nicely', 'Martha', 'Mrs', 'Medlock', 'Ben', 'Weatherstaff', 'Lord', 'Craven', 'Even', 'actress', 'Lilias', 'Mary', 'mother', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'most', 'poignant', 'being', 'reaching', 'out', 'Mary', 'dreams', 'Lilias', 'spirit', 'calling', 'Lord', 'Craven', ""'m"", 'garden', 'Colin', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'work.The', 'photography', 'directing', 'set', 'design', 'movie', 'also', 'beautiful', 'lovely', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'song', 'Light', 'also', 'become', 'one', 'favourites', 'are', 'themes', 'galore', 'movie', 'be', 'turn', 'seasons', 'difference', 'restrictions', 'upper', 'class', 'freedom', 'lower', 'class', 'relationships', 'various', 'parents', 'children', 'joy', 'furfullment', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'even', 'life', 'triumphing', 'death', 'even', 'picked', 'up', 'subtle', 'love', 'triangle', 'scene', 'Dickon', 'Mary', 'swing', 'together', 'Colin', 'watches', 'camera', 'intriging', 'one', 'kinda', 'wish', 'film-makers', 'had', 'developed', 'plot', 'thread', 'further.All', 'movie', 'absolute', 'highest', 'rating', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', 'movie', 'can', 'possibly', 'get', 'Watch', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'age', 'are']",N/A

As a father of four daughters, I find it bewildering that anyone could even consider this an issue.The only other fleeting glimpse of the young actress's chest comes in the first scene, in which she is being dressed by her servant in India, although this is a more distant shot. I can see how this might be considered gratuitous or unnecessary, but in terms of actual content, it barely constitutes even partial nudity.The pagan reference is presumably the brief scene in which the young Colin makes up a chant to bring his father back from a vacation/business trip, as the children and the gardener are sitting around an outdoor fire, at night. The scene followed an earlier innocent discussion of the magic inherent in Life itself and the importance of embracing it, rather than hiding away.The father then has a touching dream in which the spirit of his dead wife calls him back to the garden.Hardly X-rated stuff.This is a lovely version and avoids some of the needlessly dark excesses of some earlier productions.Highly recommended.",5,Wonderful remake - don't buy the negative reviews,1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,1544,"['delightful', 'version', 'classic', 'story', 'striking', 'performances', 'Kate', 'Maberly', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'John', 'Lynch', 'all.I', 'was', 'astonished', 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'criticizing', 'everything', 'child', 'nudity', 'encouraging', 'paganism.To', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'brief', 'scene', 'ten-year-old', 'Kate', 'getting', 'bath', 'second', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'right', 'nipple', 'do', 'not', 'say', ""'breast"", 'not', 'way', 'developed', 'point', 'life', 'father', 'four', 'daughters', 'find', 'bewildering', 'anyone', 'could', 'even', 'consider', 'issue.The', 'only', 'other', 'fleeting', 'glimpse', 'young', 'actress', 'chest', 'first', 'scene', 'being', 'dressed', 'servant', 'India', 'more', 'distant', 'shot', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'gratuitous', 'unnecessary', 'terms', 'actual', 'content', 'barely', 'even', 'partial', 'nudity.The', 'pagan', 'reference', 'presumably', 'brief', 'scene', 'young', 'Colin', 'up', 'chant', 'bring', 'father', 'back', 'vacation/business', 'trip', 'children', 'gardener', 'are', 'sitting', 'outdoor', 'fire', 'night', 'scene', 'followed', 'earlier', 'innocent', 'discussion', 'magic', 'inherent', 'Life', 'importance', 'embracing', 'rather', 'hiding', 'away.The', 'father', 'then', 'touching', 'dream', 'spirit', 'dead', 'wife', 'back', 'garden.Hardly', 'X-rated', 'stuff.This', 'lovely', 'version', 'avoids', 'needlessly', 'dark', 'excesses', 'earlier', 'productions.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Burnett, but it did appeal to me, that's why when I ran into it at my local video store, I couldn't help myself from buying it, I payed $4.99 for it and I quickly realized what a bargain that was.  This movie was worth every penny, absolutely gorgeous.This is one of those films, aimed mainly at children, that the whole family can enjoy, both the young and old.  The story centers around Mary Lennox, recently orphaned, sent to live with her uncle at an old manor, surrounded by a gloomy and foggy moor.  At first, Mary doesn't seem to enjoy it, not because she misses her neglective parents, but because she is lonely and longs for someone to play with.  At the manor, she must live with the mean Mrs. Medlock, whom she dislikes, however, Mary soon makes friends with Martha, her younger brother Dickon and a young ill boy named Colin, who is Mary's cousin.Mary discovers many secrets, as why Colin is always kept in a lonely bed and why her uncle is so down and depressed, but the biggest secret she finds is the entrance to an old garden, which she and her new friend Dickon help bring to life.This movie, as I have already stated, is beautifully filmed, with lots of beautiful landscapes and settings and the most breathtaking melodies ever, many following the tone of the closing song ""Winter Light.""  The actors portray their characters wonderfully.  The film doesn't particularly have much humor, most of the comic relief here is given by Martha, in a way she is a funny character, this is a good thing for the film not to have much humor, it adds to it's 'gloomy' beauty.This movie inspired me to read the book, at first I had a bit of trouble understanding what was going on, both in the book and in the film, I especially had a bit of trouble understanding the Yorkshire accents of some of the characters, but after repeated viewings, I began to understand better.  I would recommend this film to anyone, if you get a chance, get the soundtrack as well, as the music is one of the stronger points of the film.",5,Visually stunning!

WOW -- was I ever wrong!What I saw was beautiful and captivating, artistic and entrancing -- filmmaking of the highest order. &#34;The Secret Garden&#34; is a movie of such artistic quality that it ranks up there with the hallowed original &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34; (although they're totally different genres). It's no surprise that Francis Ford Coppola had his hand in both pics -- he was, of course, the director of &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34; and he's the executive producer of &#34;The Secret Garden.&#34;In any event, the cinematography is breathtaking and the score is awe-inspiring, ranking with the best in cinematic history.***PLOT SPOILER***The story's about a spoiled 10-year old English girl, orphaned in India, who comes home to live on her uncle's vast estate in the early 1900s. The girl, Mary, finds herself trapped in a mysterious, colossal manor -- almost a castle -- tyrannically managed by a life-stifling witch, Mrs. Medlock, in the frequent absence of her uncle, Lord Cravin. Because Mary is intelligent, independent and sly she is able to reconnoiter the manor and learn its forbidding secrets. The biggest secret is that her aunt died ten years earlier and her son, Colin, still lives there, albeit confined to a bed, sickly and unable to walk. Her uncle never healed from this heartbreak.Mary discovers another secret in her explorations, a hidden garden, closed off and neglected since her aunt's death. After meeting the sickly and sad Colin, Mary inevitably finds a way to sneak him into the garden along with her pal Dickon. She senses that Colin isn't as sick as everyone is convinced; she knows the best thing would be to get him out of the dreary castle and the oppressive clutches of Mrs. Medlock. Mary and her secret garden are the keys to restoring health, life and freedom to Colin, Lord Cravin and the gloomy manor.***END SPOILER***&#34;The Secret Garden&#34; is sort of a 1990's version of the outstanding &#34;Pollyanna&#34; with Hayley Mills (1960). Both pics involve a young girl restoring a spirit of joy and liberty to a lifeless community. The difference is that Mary is not even remotely the &#34;glad girl&#34; Pollyanna. In fact, look for the hilarious line from the old gardener who responds to Mary's puzzlement concerning her lack of friends.&#34;The Secret Garden&#34; is no doubt labeled a &#34;children's film,&#34; which is a shame because it transcends such a limiting category. The ending's too quaint for my tastes but, nevertheless, this is a beautiful work of wonder and deep mystery, which can be enjoyed by people of all ages -- children and adults.The film was shot in England and runs 101 minutes.GRADE: A",5,"Beautiful, reverent, awe-inspiring",1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,2997,"['be', 'honest', 'remember', 'seeing', 'previews', 'movie', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1993', 'thinking', '34', 'WHY', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'see', 'such', 'film', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'make', '34', 'Well', 'about', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'appeared', 'TV', 'one', 'night', 'started', 'watching', 'fully', 'expecting', 'turn', 'off', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'WOW', 'was', 'ever', 'wrong', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'beautiful', 'captivating', 'artistic', 'entrancing', 'filmmaking', 'highest', 'order', '34', 'Secret', 'Garden', '34', 'movie', 'such', 'artistic', 'quality', 'there', 'hallowed', 'original', '34', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', '34', ""'re"", 'totally', 'different', 'genres', 'surprise', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'had', 'hand', 'pics', 'was', 'course', 'director', '34', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', '34', 'executive', 'producer', '34', 'Secret', 'Garden.', '34', 'event', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'score', 'awe-inspiring', 'ranking', 'best', 'cinematic', 'history', '***PLOT', 'SPOILER***The', 'story', 'spoiled', '10-year', 'old', 'English', 'girl', 'orphaned', 'India', 'who', 'home', 'live', 'uncle', 'vast', 'estate', 'early', '1900s', 'girl', 'Mary', 'trapped', 'mysterious', 'colossal', 'manor', 'almost', 'castle', 'tyrannically', 'managed', 'life-stifling', 'witch', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'frequent', 'absence', 'uncle', 'Lord', 'Cravin', 'Mary', 'intelligent', 'independent', 'sly', 'able', 'reconnoiter', 'manor', 'learn', 'forbidding', 'secrets', 'biggest', 'secret', 'aunt', 'died', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'son', 'Colin', 'still', 'there', 'albeit', 'confined', 'bed', 'sickly', 'unable', 'walk', 'uncle', 'never', 'healed', 'heartbreak.Mary', 'discovers', 'secret', 'explorations', 'hidden', 'garden', 'closed', 'off', 'neglected', 'aunt', 'death', 'meeting', 'sickly', 'sad', 'Colin', 'Mary', 'inevitably', 'way', 'sneak', 'garden', 'pal', 'Dickon', 'Colin', ""n't"", 'as', 'sick', 'everyone', 'convinced', 'best', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'get', 'dreary', 'castle', 'oppressive', 'clutches', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'Mary', 'secret', 'garden', 'are', 'keys', 'restoring', 'health', 'life', 'freedom', 'Colin', 'Lord', 'Cravin', 'gloomy', 'manor', '***END', 'SPOILER***', '34', 'Secret', 'Garden', '34', 'sort', '1990', 'version', 'outstanding', '34', 'Pollyanna', '34', 'Hayley', 'Mills', '1960', 'pics', 'involve', 'young', 'girl', 'restoring', 'spirit', 'joy', 'liberty', 'lifeless', 'community', 'difference', 'Mary', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', '34', 'glad', 'girl', '34', 'Pollyanna', 'fact', 'look', 'hilarious', 'line', 'old', 'gardener', 'who', 'Mary', 'puzzlement', 'concerning', 'lack', 'friends.', '34', 'Secret', 'Garden', '34', 'doubt', 'labeled', '34', 'children', 'film', '34', 'shame', 'such', 'limiting', 'category', 'ending', 'too', 'quaint', 'tastes', 'nevertheless', 'beautiful', 'work', 'wonder', 'deep', 'mystery', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'people', 'ages', 'children', 'adults.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'England', '101', 'minutes.GRADE']",N/A
