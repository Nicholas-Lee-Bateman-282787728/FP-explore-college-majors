1266632,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B002FOQXSM,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","I have to say that I was ready to turn this series off after two episodes.  The female protagonists were so grating with their constant bickering and talking all at once. It was worse in the English dub (I tried both).  But after a few faltering steps forward, the series gets going, and the characters seem to come to grips with their situation and calm it down.So here are four girls.  Dead.  The mysteriously brought back to life.  They are commanded by a mysterious (and ugly) woman to slay demonic appearing men or face true death.So that's how things start.  It is set in New York, which is fun.  Trying to listen in English was nice (seeing how it is New York), but the Japanese voice acting is better.  I flip between the two audios at whim and have to say that there are pros and cons to both.  The settings are well researched, and it truly appears to be based on real New York locations.The story starts off convoluted enough, but then manages to sort itself out.  I would say that it's not really a horror genre or a demon slayer genre, but something in between.  It reminds me a bit of Witch Hunter Robin (though Witch Hunter Robin has an A+ story).My biggest beef is that while the animation and settings are nice, the picture quality is terrible.  I don't think it was an intentional mask put over the series to give a grainy texture, instead it looks like bad digital transferring. Everything just looks hazy, like old TVs with rabbit ears... where you get the station coming in but it's just a bit hazy.  Now I'm okay with an intentional mask, like in Ghost Hunt (in some of the creepy scenes), but if it is a mask then why does it appear 100% of the time, even during daylight.  Plus it's not obvious enough to be intentional.  It would probably look okay on a smaller screen, not my 48"" LCD.  Gonzo is top notch, so I don't think they would have let this slide for the original.My only other beef is that the story is just 'hem'.  The girls are all somewhat interesting, but not really overly likable.  My favorite characters were the 'bad guys'!But stick with it for at least four episodes and you will likely finish the set.And for less than $14 you can't go wrong!",4,"Starts off slowly, gets more interesting, never really delivers...",1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,2186,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'ready', 'turn', 'series', 'off', 'two', 'episodes', 'female', 'protagonists', 'were', 'so', 'grating', 'constant', 'bickering', 'talking', 'once', 'was', 'worse', 'English', 'dub', 'tried', 'few', 'faltering', 'steps', 'forward', 'series', 'going', 'characters', 'seem', 'come', 'grips', 'situation', 'calm', 'down.So', 'here', 'are', 'four', 'girls', 'Dead', 'mysteriously', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'are', 'commanded', 'mysterious', 'ugly', 'woman', 'slay', 'demonic', 'appearing', 'men', 'face', 'true', 'death.So', 'how', 'things', 'start', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'fun', 'Trying', 'listen', 'English', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'how', 'New', 'York', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'better', 'flip', 'two', 'audios', 'whim', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'pros', 'cons', 'settings', 'are', 'well', 'researched', 'truly', 'be', 'based', 'real', 'New', 'York', 'locations.The', 'story', 'off', 'convoluted', 'enough', 'then', 'sort', 'out', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'really', 'horror', 'genre', 'demon', 'slayer', 'genre', 'something', 'bit', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'A+', 'story', '.My', 'biggest', 'beef', 'animation', 'settings', 'are', 'nice', 'picture', 'quality', 'terrible', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'intentional', 'mask', 'put', 'series', 'give', 'grainy', 'texture', 'instead', 'bad', 'digital', 'transferring', 'Everything', 'just', 'hazy', 'old', 'TVs', 'rabbit', 'ears', 'where', 'get', 'station', 'coming', 'just', 'bit', 'hazy', 'Now', ""'m"", 'okay', 'intentional', 'mask', 'Ghost', 'Hunt', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'mask', 'then', 'why', 'appear', '100', '%', 'time', 'even', 'daylight', 'not', 'obvious', 'enough', 'be', 'intentional', 'would', 'probably', 'look', 'okay', 'smaller', 'screen', 'not', '48', 'LCD', 'Gonzo', 'top', 'notch', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'let', 'slide', 'original.My', 'only', 'other', 'beef', 'story', 'just', ""'hem"", 'girls', 'are', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'not', 'really', 'overly', 'likable', 'favorite', 'characters', 'were', ""'bad"", 'guys', 'stick', 'least', 'four', 'episodes', 'will', 'likely', 'finish', 'set.And', 'less', '14', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']",N/A

The storyline as well as the story telling in this show is great. There are maybe a FEW things I would've changed but the reason why five female high school characters as the lead of a genuine horror thriller cartoon works so well is because it's actually portrayed in a very realistic way. For two reasons.One is because of the dialogue and audio. The things these girls say sometimes are actually so realistically scary sometimes that I forget that I'm watching an anime. They talk like real girls from New York and beside the supernatural aspect of the show, they have real life problems when they're not fighting gouhls in the night.Another reason is because of the fashion. these girls where a different outfit I kid you not: EVERY single episode. It makes it again very realistic because no body wears anything that they wouldn't normally wear.

1266638,A3MECYYIZJA8JJ,B002FOQXSM,"Midnight Run ""5000""","[8, 12]","First of all, this is a beautifully drawn anime. If you are just trying to show someone the best a genre has to offer, a few scenes of this will go a long way of making your case. The actual story and development is something else.I was extremely pleased that this was set in New York City...instead of Tokyo. Although NYC is played out when it comes to American produced movies, Tokyo is certainly overexposed in almost every anime ever made. The girls are real characters with great development and we are expected to know them and understand them and relate to them because the series spends time with each one. We also get a good amount of time seeing them come together (or not) when their circumstances demand which is also a refreshing change from the usual. However, once the big plot point is revealed and we see them start to form a team to do their job, I was left with a bit of disappointment in their ""fighting style."" It just seemed odd to go through this much trouble so this young women could fight with planks and bats. And it just never seemed to escalate further from there.In a sense, the anime sets you up for this huge world of action and intrigue but just never really explores it or answers any questions. I don't like having everything spelled out for me and I don't want all loose ends tied up in a neat little conclusion at the end of every show, but Red Garden didn't seem to want to resolve anything.Still, you need to see it.",3,"Sets a full table, but never serves all the courses",1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,1455,"['First', 'all', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'anime', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'show', 'someone', 'best', 'genre', 'offer', 'few', 'scenes', 'will', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'case', 'actual', 'story', 'development', 'something', 'else.I', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'was', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'instead', 'Tokyo', 'NYC', 'played', 'out', 'when', 'American', 'produced', 'movies', 'Tokyo', 'certainly', 'overexposed', 'almost', 'anime', 'ever', 'made', 'girls', 'are', 'real', 'characters', 'great', 'development', 'are', 'expected', 'know', 'understand', 'relate', 'series', 'time', 'one', 'also', 'get', 'good', 'amount', 'time', 'seeing', 'come', 'together', 'not', 'when', 'circumstances', 'demand', 'also', 'refreshing', 'change', 'usual', 'However', 'once', 'big', 'plot', 'point', 'revealed', 'see', 'start', 'form', 'team', 'do', 'job', 'was', 'left', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'fighting', 'style', 'just', 'seemed', 'odd', 'go', 'much', 'trouble', 'so', 'young', 'women', 'could', 'fight', 'planks', 'bats', 'just', 'never', 'seemed', 'escalate', 'further', 'there.In', 'sense', 'anime', 'sets', 'up', 'huge', 'world', 'action', 'intrigue', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'questions', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'having', 'everything', 'spelled', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'loose', 'ends', 'tied', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'conclusion', 'end', 'show', 'Red', 'Garden', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'resolve', 'anything.Still', 'need', 'see']",N/A
1266639,A3GFK7F5IUF60X,B002FOQXSM,"Myra Schjelderup ""Ignolopi""","[1, 3]","What makes a good anime? For me, it's plot, characters, dialog, art, music, and the ending. Add a dash of humor for perfection.First, a basic understanding of the show: Red Garden is a horror, supernatural, high-school drama, friendship, and fighting anime. It is not recommended for younger children, but the imagery is not terribly disturbing. There is mild language in the Japanese (I don't know about the English), and the subtitles displayed strong language once.The Plot:Four girls at a fancy private high school in New York City start the morning one day without any recollection of what happened the night before.Kate is the quiet, rich girl who likes everyone to get along. Rachel is the very social fashionable party girl with a boyfriend. Rose is the cute, helpless, family girl who takes care of her younger siblings. Claire is the girl from a rich family that she shuns, living from paycheck to paycheck. Their only connection is that they were all friends with Lise, whose body was found in a string of apparent suicides in the city.Things become only a little clearer when the 4 of them are gathered and told that they all died the night before, and that in order to hold on to their borrowed lives they must fight dog-man monsters at night. As you may imagine, none of them are particularly cut out for this, and the second episode gives you a very dramatized very realistic fight scene that involves a lot of sobbing and screaming.However, the show is not all about fighting monsters at night. Little by little the girls come to understand why they are fighting, and try hard to deal with the late nights, terrifying experiences, and the fact that they are dead.The Characters:The characters are excellently done, very realistic. Their development and relationships with others and each other grow and change over the series. Even though they are thrown together they don't become instant best-buddies, as with most anime, but actually have to work at their relationships.Kate and Claire seem to take the change best, and make efforts to learn how to fight. Rose is wimpy, scared, and tries not to acknowledge her new night-life. Rachel takes it the hardest and goes through several episodes, argues with her friends, and seems to completely ruin her social life. Each girl has several layers that make them likable characters even when they are irritating.The supporting characters are not to be dismissed. Among the apparent villains there are a few I had a hard time disliking. Although at a couple points good & evil seem well-defined, it keeps turning around, and in the end you wonder who really wins.The Dialog:Red Garden has possibly the best cast and performance of actors I've seen thus far in anime (for the Japanese). Part of it is because the actresses chosen for the 4 girls did a great job, part of it is in how they did the recording. I've heard that a) they first recorded the voices then drew the art around it, and b) they recorded the 4 girls together rather than one at a time. This made the dialog, expression, flow of spoken words, and especially arguments incredibly realistic. In anime, characters hardly ever speak over each other. In Red Garden, when they argue, they really argue.The lines were well thought-out; there were none of those cheesy/over-dramatized lines that make you want to pull out your hair, few to none of those conversations designed strictly to inform the viewer.The Art:The art for the whole series is excellent, beautiful but not the flowery shojo. I liked the fashion; the girls change their outfits quite often, each with their individual style.The Music:I really liked the beginning credits. The visuals are creative and flashy, the music kind of jazzy. The first ending credits were a bit odd, the second has good music and a creative background. Different from typical credits.The soundtrack is well done. Funnily enough, the girls sing. Two or three times they fall into a depressed, teary song phase -- not with their trained voices, either, but what you might expect distressed teens to actually sound like without warming up their voices. (Although dramatic scenes, I had to laugh...)The Ending:As you can probably tell I like just about everything about this anime -- the one thing that gets me is the ending. Admittedly, I can't think of a better way to end it, but it seems like there is something missing. I know, life doesn't always get wrapped up nice with a ribbon on top, and it's hard to end a story, but you may not be fully satisfied. I'm not sure if the OVA (one 45-min episode) adds or takes from the series ending, but it is different from the main show and worth watching.The Result:All in all, Red Garden isn't perfect, but it's worth more than a single viewing. It's sad but cute, there's a cool plot but I feel it wasn't explained fully, you can take it seriously (like me) or you may enjoy making fun of the show and the characters and the singing. (You can make fun of the singing anyway :) I can't say if Red Garden would be appealing to a male audience, it depends if you can empathize with teenage girls (or enjoy making fun of them).I've seen the whole series twice, and intend to watch it again. I recommend you give it a shot.",5,Mystery/Horror/Teen Drama in NYC,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,5228,"['What', 'good', 'anime', 'plot', 'characters', 'dialog', 'art', 'music', 'ending', 'Add',

1266640,AHF97M45JFCB,B002FOQXSM,ONENEO,"[59, 60]","Red Garden is one of those rare anime titles that slips through the cracks as far as placing it into a single genre is concerned.  It spans a pretty wide variety of subjects and pacing but at its core is a basically a mystery laced with supernatural undertones. But before we get ahead of ourselves here, let's take a look at the hard facts.Originally released in individual season sets by ADV Films, this set represents the first time the complete series with OVA is being released to the public. Coming in at a total runtime of 600 minutes, Red Garden The Complete Series spans 4 discs and comes packaged as a pair of thin packs within a cardboard slipcase.The show wears an appropriate TV MA (17+) rating, which is due to some disturbing imagery and horror-themes and some segments loaded with gore/ violence.Language options are typical sub & dub meaning the option of original Japanese dialog track (in Stereo) or an English dub (Dolby Digital 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound) and English subtitles available under either language choice.The breakdown consists of 22 episodes and the OVA, and of course, a nice host of Funimation trailers.To explain the show to someone who has never seen it would go something like this: A wave of teen suicides washes over New York City (not Tokyo for once) and we follow the exploits of four teenage girls/ high school classmates:  Kate, a rich preppy snob, Rose, family babysitter and modest personality; Rachel, party chick extraordinaire; and Claire, the quiet rebel.The girls all wake up one morning only to discover that they cannot remember anything of the night before.Things really get creepy when an old woman informs them that their proverbial cards have already been pulled and though they still appear alive, death is on its way to claim each girl.While this all sounds terribly hopeless, there is a way to cheat destiny in that when called upon on certain nights, they are to engage in brutal and bloody battles against evil human-dogs.  By day, they have to go on as if nothing's out of the ordinary (and here you thought staying awake in high school was hard enough when you stayed up to watch Letterman).The visuals of the show seem to be either a love or hate affair (kind of like Gonzo's other contemporary remakes Gankutsuou and Romeo x Juliet).  Gone are the typical wide-glassy eyes of anime girls and their place are bright, simplistic tones in the day, dark and gritty (borderline gothic) sequences once the sun sets.The pacing of the show is nice and consistent with layers of the larger mystery (including what these seemingly unrelated girls have in common) being slowly revealed amidst the zombie-dog slashing action.The voice work is fantastic in either incarnation with the English dub actually nailing the mood every bit as effectively as the original Japanese track maybe because its one of few anime titles out there set in the United States with English character names and locations.  For once it actually feels like the English actors have a slight edge on the pronunciation angle.Which brings me to my next point of interest:  Like with past Gonzo properties, the attention to detail in setting and location is fantastic.  Many of us have never been to Tokyo so we have to take their word for the accuracy but it becomes a different story when such national landmarks as those found in NYC become the backdrop.  Gonzo deserves major credit for the scouting and research work that had to have gone into the production of this piece.I wouldn't go as far as to say that this title is for everyone even though my critique appears quite favorable in hindsight.  It takes a pretty unique set of expectations on the viewer's behalf to make the most of the experience.  There are essentially two sides to the story: One resembles the atypical common cross-section of teenage schoolgirls and personality archetypes.  The other could probably best be described as an animated version of popular survival-horror video games like Resident Evil.  The blending of the two concepts work well in some segments but feel a little forced in others.

However, because I forgot to check for the rating I decided to watch it first. This was the scariest anime I had ever seen and I actually enjoyed it very much.  There were a few unnecessary fowl words but no were near as bad as South Park. It wasn't overly gory and for the first few DVDs it was really quite suspenseful. Somewhere in the middle I did get tired of the same fight scenes and that one girl who kept crying was killing me. The story actually picks up again towards the latter half but does not go out with a bang. I watched it again with her and she really liked it too even though she normally tries her best not to like my purchases.

1266642,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B002FOQXSM,RavenRing,"[3, 5]","SynopsisIn New York City, four girls wake up with no memory of the night before. That evening, a strange women tells them that the reason they don't remember is that they all died that night. Now they are living in borrowed bodies, and the only way to keep them is to kill strange dog men in the dead of night. Kate is a shy rich girl, Claire is tough and sensible, Rose is timid, and Rachel the social party girl. The only connection between the four of them is that they were all friends with Lise, who died the same night they did.What would you do if you found out you were dead?ArtworkThe first thing I noticed about this series was the artwork. After watching hundreds of anime shows and movies, Red Garden was especially impressive. In addition to beautiful and detailed designs, the girls actually change clothes! Rachel, the social butterfly, changes the most often and into detailed and fashionable outfits.Also, the characters were animated after recording the voices, so the lips move with words instead of simply opening and closing at approximately the right times. In addition to recording the voices first, they also recorded them together, so it really sounds like the characters are talking to each other. In on scene Claire argues with her father, shouting at him as he tries to explain something to her. It is very realistic, in real life people don't often take turns shouting as they do in most anime.CharactersAfter the artwork, the characters were next things I noticed. The characters were the most believable I seen in an anime, with believable emotions and reactions. They had personalities, not stereotypes. The most amazing thing is that they actually grow and develop in the course of the series. They become tougher and more mature. There is plenty of drama, especially from Rachel, but it was completely understandable, as they have to cope with being dead and killing, while hiding it from their friends and family.StoryAnd finally, the story. A big part of the story is how the girls cope with their new situation, but there is also a healthy dose of mystery involved. Why were they killed and why were they brought back to life? What are the things that thy fight and why? And what happened to Lise? The mystery is well done and intriguing. There are some loose ends and small plot holes, but they are unimportant to the overall story, and I honestly didn't really care much about the loose ends and the plot holes didn't bother me.OVAThe OVA really changes the tone of the series end. So if you really like the way the series ended, don't watch the OVA. I personally really loved where the story went in the OVA, it opened all sorts of new doors and sparked my imagination - but it is short and doesn't explore much of what it introduces. So if the loose ends in the series bugged you, don't watch the OVA.AudioThe Japanese dub is awesome. The girls were really brought to life by their voice actors. I tried briefly to watch it in English, and was simply too appalled to continue. After the excellent Japanese voice acting, it was painful to listen to lazy American actors with horrible voices.The music for this show is really good as well. It sets the tone for the mystery, horror, and fashion of the story. I normally don't remember the music of the anime shows I watch, but Red Garden is one of the very few exceptions where I can still hear the music in my head long after watching the series.In ConclusionI love this show. I highly recommend it, though it is not for everyone. As a show about teenage girls, I don't know if guys would be interested. If nothing in my review interested you, this show probably isn't for you either. But reading this review has made you at all curious, I hope you will give this series a chance. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",5,Unique Viewing Experiance,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,3806,"['SynopsisIn', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'four', 'girls', 'wake', 'up', 'memory', 'night', 'before', 'evening', 'strange', 'women', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'died', 'night', 'Now', 'are', 'living', 'borrowed', 'bodies', 'only', 'way', 'keep', 'kill', 'strange', 'dog', 'men', 'dead', 'night', 'Kate', 'shy', 'rich', 'girl', 'Claire', 'tough', 'sensible', 'Rose', 'timid', 'Rachel', 'social', 'party', 'girl', 'only', 'connection', 'four', 'were', 'friends', 'Lise', 'who', 'died', 'same', 'night', 'would', 'do', 'found', 'were', 'dead', 'ArtworkThe', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'series', 'was', 'artwork', 'watching', 'hundreds', 'anime', 'shows', 'movies', 'Red', 'Garden', 'was', 'especially', 'impressive', 'addition', 'beautiful', 'detailed', 'designs', 'girls', 'actually', 'change', 'clothes', 'Rachel', 'social', 'butterfly', 'most', 'often', 'detailed', 'fashionable', 'outfits.Also', 'characters', 'were', 'animated', 'recording', 'voices', 'lips', 'move', 'words', 'instead', 'simply', 'opening', 'closing', 'approximately', 'right', 'times', 'addition', 'recording', 'voices', 'first', 'also', 'recorded', 'together', 'really', 'characters', 'are', 'talking', 'other', 'scene', 'Claire', 'father', 'shouting', 'explain', 'something', 'very', 'realistic', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'take', 'turns', 'shouting', 'do', 'most', 'anime.CharactersAfter', 'artwork', 'characters', 'were', 'next', 'things', 'noticed', 'characters', 'were', 'most', 'believable', 'seen', 'anime', 'believable', 'emotions', 'reactions', 'had', 'personalities', 'not', 'stereotypes', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'actually', 'grow', 'develop', 'course', 'series', 'become', 'tougher', 'more', 'mature', 'plenty', 'drama', 'especially', 'Rachel', 'was', 'completely', 'understandable', 'have', 'cope', 'being', 'dead', 'killing', 'hiding', 'friends', 'family.StoryAnd', 'finally', 'story', 'big', 'part', 'story', 'how', 'girls', 'cope', 'new', 'situation', 'also', 'healthy', 'dose', 'mystery', 'involved', 'Why', 'were', 'killed', 'why', 'were', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'What', 'are', 'things', 'thy', 'fight', 'why', 'what', 'happened', 'Lise', 'mystery', 'well', 'done', 'intriguing', 'are', 'loose', 'ends', 'small', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'unimportant', 'overall', 'story', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'much', 'loose', 'ends', 'plot', 'holes', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'me.OVAThe', 'OVA', 'really', 'tone', 'series', 'end', 'So', 'really', 'way', 'series', 'ended', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'OVA', 'personally', 'really', 'loved', 'where', 'story', 'went', 'OVA', 'opened', 'sorts', 'new', 'doors', 'sparked', 'imagination', 'short', ""n't"", 'explore', 'much', 'what', 'So', 'loose', 'ends', 'series', 'bugged', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'OVA.AudioThe', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'awesome', 'girls', 'were', 'really', 'brought', 'life', 'voice', 'actors', 'tried', 'briefly', 'watch', 'English', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'appalled', 'continue', 'excellent', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'painful', 'listen', 'lazy', 'American', 'actors', 'horrible', 'voices.The', 'music', 'show', 'really', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'tone', 'mystery', 'horror', 'fashion', 'story', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'music', 'anime', 'watch', 'Red', 'Garden', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions', 'where', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'music', 'head', 'long', 'watching', 'series.In', 'ConclusionI', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'everyone', 'show', 'teenage', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guys', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'nothing', 'review', 'interested', 'show', 'probably', ""n't"", 'reading', 'review', 'made', 'curious', 'hope', 'will', 'give', 'series', 'chance', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'do']",N/A
1266643,AFV2584U13XP3,B002FOQXSM,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[4, 11]","The series seems to try to be a blend of Witch Hunter Robin and Claymore but while theses other two series prove to be far more entertaining and enjoyable to watch this series just seemed almost bland both with its characters and storyline.  The animation while decent for the most part was really hampered by the video quality of this set at least with mine and my friends as far as I know, meaning that when I first watched the first dvd the graininess of the video was almost appalling something I've never really seen from a Funimation product before but someone said that ADV films had the rights to this series first and actually released it first if that's true or not doesn't really matter though the poor quality is still there.  The second was the audio while the Japanese audio track was great the English dubbed while a good cast the mix was very off with the sound coming from one side for a few episodes which was also an annoyance when you tried to listen to the show,  I can't say if this set was a bad egg from the bunch or not still again a poor quality for a released set.  The last complaint would probably be the characters none of them while bad aren't truly likable either you just don't really bother with caring what happens to them really and while they do somewhat evolve throughout the series at the end it just doesn't seem to be really enough to care anymore about them.  So if you're a fan of the Witch Hunter Robin or Claymore series and might be interested in this series I'd advise watching a few episodes first before buying just to see if t he series is truly worth your time and while the price is very affordable right now I do regret my choice in getting this one....",2,Tries To Come Out As An Action-Filled Supernatural Anime But Nothing But Annoyance At The End,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,1706,"['series', 'try', 'be', 'blend', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'Claymore', 'theses', 'other', 'two', 'series', 'prove', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'series', 'just', 'seemed', 'almost', 'bland', 'characters', 'storyline', 'animation', 'decent', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'really', 'hampered', 'video', 'quality', 'set', 'least', 'mine', 'friends', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'meaning', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'first', 'graininess', 'video', 'was', 'almost', 'appalling', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'Funimation', 'product', 'someone', 'said', 'ADV', 'films', 'had', 'rights', 'series', 'first', 'actually', 'released', 'first', 'true', 'not', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'poor', 'quality', 'still', 'there', 'second', 'was', 'audio', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'track', 'was', 'great', 'English', 'dubbed', 'good', 'cast', 'mix', 'was', 'very', 'sound', 'coming', 'one', 'side', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'also', 'annoyance', 'when', 'tried', 'listen', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'set', 'was', 'bad', 'egg', 'bunch', 'not', 'still', 'again', 'poor', 'quality', 'released', 'set', 'last', 'complaint', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'characters', 'none', 'bad', 'are', ""n't"", 'truly', 'likable', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'caring', 'what', 'really', 'do', 'somewhat', 'evolve', 'series', 'end', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'really', 'enough', 'care', 'anymore', 'So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'Claymore', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'series', ""'d"", 'advise', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'first', 'buying', 'just', 'see', 't', 'series', 'truly', 'worth', 'time', 'price', 'very', 'affordable', 'right', 'now', 'do', 'regret', 'choice', 'getting', 'one']",N/A

The show itself shows very little in way of violence, and the only murdering or blood it even presents to the viewer is done in a very stressful way to show the impact that being forced to kill someone or something has on the human mind.  The show is more about family ties, friends, an overlying problem having to deal with two waring families and the lives being affected by horrible time and place accidents.  I'd rate this show highly, yet it's not my all-time favorite either.The character reactions and attitudes are believable.  I found myself impressed by the quality in that department.  However, the actual image quality of the show isn't very good.  I doubt it's because it's on DVD, but the screen has a sort of fuzzy quality to it throughout the whole show.  It may be on purpose, but it doesn't look too good in the end.Package-For those of you ordering through Amazon and choosing to have Amazon package and ship it to you, the packaging is the perfect size for the item and its quality is good enough with minimal cardboard which I like.  You all probably know what the package will be like if you've ordered through here before.  The show comes with no special features worth watching (from what I've seen on Disks 1 and 2 so far) except a textless opening.
