One reviewer at the time aptly described the show as becoming ""homogenized"" as the characters became more like the actors that portrayed them.Part of the appeal of the original series was the fact that these people were thrown into a setting where they couldn't leave.  They lived and worked in a war zone far away from home and had to learn to get along. ""After MASH"" was set in a stateside hospital.  The characters we had become familiar with could now go home to their families and leave the work day behind them.That was just uninteresting to me.  And besides, some characters are better talked about than actually seen (Mrs. Potter).

AfterMASH was number 15 out of the 30 best TV Shows and getting 20.1% of viewers, according to the Nielsen rating (The Nielsen Rating is the percent of all TV-equipped homes tuned to the program on an average night, as measured by Nielsen Media Research).AfterMASH first telecasted on September 26th, 1983 until December 18th, 1984.

639588,ADZEFRWULAA9Q,B00005JOBW,"M. White ""Irish Sharky""","[2, 2]","I was skeptical about this, thinking it was another poorly made sequal or spinoff like so many (See Three's A Crowd, the spinoff of Three's Company).  I watched the pilot episode on Youtube in 5 ten minute intervals.  I liked the characters of COL Potter and Klinger.  This is not M*A*S*H, but I do like the perspective of the VA Hospital.  There is the unnecessay conflict of the lady that has to approve the paperwork for Klinger, but it also shows how some veterans survive war and cannot leave the war after returning home.  It is also hard to find shows with that early and mid 80's feeling.  I greatly enjoyed this show and it is nice to see the familiar characters again.The characters from the original show do not include anyone, but it seems fitting to only have COL Potter, Klinger and Father Mulcahy.  Hawkeye does not belong in this show as he was so politically antiwar that he would probably spend many years in a VA Hospital after returning for PTSD.  Klinger would obviously have problems since he tried so hard to be evicted from the Army, then conformed and when he had finally had acheived his goal of being able to leave Korea, he chose to stay and brought his wife to Toledo.  Not gaining any desirable job skills, he chose to earn a living illegally.  A sympathetic judge allows him to start a new life with his old Commander.  COL Potter, realizes his war years left him enjoying leadership and responsibility and he finds retirement boring so he chooses to help veterans as a doctor and take care of his old clerk, Klinger.  Father Francis Mulcahy returns from war and turns to alcohol when his hadicap won't allow him to hear confessions.  A new surgery returns much of his hearing and he chooses to be the spiritual guide for the veterans in the VA Hospital.I greatly enjoyed the pilot episode and will order the whole series.  It may be cheesy, but that is how mid 80's shows should be.  The familiar characters are a nice welcome and the perspective of a VA Hospital after a war is new and interesting.  It may not be great, but it is better than a lot of shows on today.",5,"Not the same as the show M*A*S*H, but entertaining in its characters and view of a VA Hospital.",1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,2100,"['was', 'skeptical', 'thinking', 'was', 'poorly', 'made', 'sequal', 'spinoff', 'so', 'many', 'See', 'Three', 'A', 'Crowd', 'spinoff', 'Three', 'Company', 'watched', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Youtube', '5', 'ten', 'minute', 'intervals', 'liked', 'characters', 'COL', 'Potter', 'Klinger', 'not', 'M*A*S*H', 'do', 'perspective', 'VA', 'Hospital', 'unnecessay', 'conflict', 'lady', 'approve', 'paperwork', 'Klinger', 'also', 'how', 'veterans', 'survive', 'war', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'war', 'returning', 'home', 'also', 'hard', 'find', 'shows', 'early', 'mid', '80', 'feeling', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'nice', 'see', 'familiar', 'characters', 'again.The', 'characters', 'original', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'anyone', 'fitting', 'only', 'have', 'COL', 'Potter', 'Klinger', 'Father', 'Mulcahy', 'Hawkeye', 'not', 'belong', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'politically', 'antiwar', 'would', 'probably', 'spend', 'many', 'years', 'VA', 'Hospital', 'returning', 'PTSD', 'Klinger', 'would', 'obviously', 'have', 'problems', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'evicted', 'Army', 'then', 'conformed', 'when', 'had', 'finally', 'had', 'acheived', 'goal', 'being', 'able', 'leave', 'Korea', 'chose', 'stay', 'brought', 'wife', 'Toledo', 'Not', 'gaining', 'desirable', 'job', 'skills', 'chose', 'earn', 'living', 'illegally', 'A', 'sympathetic', 'judge', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'old', 'Commander', 'COL', 'Potter', 'war', 'years', 'left', 'enjoying', 'leadership', 'responsibility', 'retirement', 'boring', 'so', 'help', 'veterans', 'doctor', 'take', 'care', 'old', 'clerk', 'Klinger', 'Father', 'Francis', 'Mulcahy', 'returns', 'war', 'alcohol', 'when', 'hadicap', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'hear', 'confessions', 'new', 'surgery', 'returns', 'much', 'hearing', 'be', 'spiritual', 'guide', 'veterans', 'VA', 'Hospital.I', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'pilot', 'episode', 'will', 'order', 'whole', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'cheesy', 'how', 'mid', '80', 'shows', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'characters', 'are', 'nice', 'welcome', 'perspective', 'VA', 'Hospital', 'war', 'new', 'interesting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'better', 'lot', 'shows', 'today']",After MASH
639589,A1UHBYL8Y2G9R9,B00005JOBW,"russianimp ""Ed""","[2, 2]","Once again, I find myself giving a good review to a product that is often given a bad one. I think people had too high of expectations for this show or the problem is they haven't seen it in a long time. I just watched most of the series for the second time in my life. The previous time I watched it was in the 80s, on CBS. It's a great show especially if you enjoy the more serious tone of the last seasons of M*A*S*H. The comedy / drama does show Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy dealing with even more government stupidity than they had in Korea. That issue, along with their interactions with their families and their patients are the basic plotline for the show. Plenty of funny moments as well and the secondary actors are quite good and recognizable. I even enjoy the theme song better than the original M*A*S*H theme. All this was true until the second season. Then they tried hard to change everything. Time slot, cast members, theme song. It crashed and burned in the middle of Season 2 trying to go against the A-Team. Overall, a main reason to write this review is to ask for the complete series to be released on DVD, ASAP! I know I am not the only fan out there and many people who liked the earlier series may check it out. Probably a four disc set and don't forget to include the pilot for W*A*L*T*E*R!
