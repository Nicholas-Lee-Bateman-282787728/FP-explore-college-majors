1298591,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B002XTXFU8,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[5, 7]","It's very difficult to describe Bronson, and even harder to pigeon hole it into a specific category or genre. Hailed a new ""Clockwork Orange"" is a bit misleading, as it doesn't really deal with an overall dystopian view of wild indoctrinated youth, more so one individuals sad spiral into mental self awareness of an inner voice. Although highly stylized, it's also overall, quite a sad depiction of infamous British criminal Michael Peterson, (renamed Charlie Bronson by his bare knuckle fight promoter boss and former inmate Lenny McLean)For me, it's extremely easy to relate to growing up in 70's England, as a young man with few options (they were hard times all round, with high employment, and a nation still suffering under the machinations of the government of the day). The filming locations and set designs are authentic, and the sense of poverty and misdirection almost tangible.What follows is ""based"" on a true story, a more accurate description would be to say it's based upon Petersons own biographies and books written while incarcerated, and then polished with a lot of poetic license by director Nicolas Wefn.A boy from a lower middle class but nonetheless stable background, Peterson displayed violent tendencies from a young age, and a slow burn feel of inevitability that he would become the nihilistic man of the title.However, from a criminal point of view, Bronson was far more of a criminal inside prison than out. A bungled hold up at a post office brought him a 7 year term, he never actually killed anyone (as he states quite clearly during the movie), and from there begins the immergence of the inner man. After the torment of his first sentence he is freed, even falls in love, and bounces around between his eccentric uncles 70's style opium den (much red lights and heavy drapes inside a projects style apartment high rise) and bare knuckle brawling against men and even dogs!Still searching for an unknown ambition, ""I only ever wanted to be famous"" voices actor Tom Hardy in the title role, and like so many people of his generation his aspirations were common for men of his age, although they did not know exactly how or what they would become famous for.Knowing his true place is back inside he quickly recommits and returns to prison, and sets about countless hostage taking, and guard beating episodes, each one gaining him more notoriety.He now begins to believe, his chance at glory lies in infamy, on the inside as a feared convict. His achievements were realized when he was labeled by the British press (and other sources) as ""Britain's most Violent criminal""Still in prison today, he has spent more than 30 years in solitary confinement for his continuous violent behavior.I'll stop here to add that Tom Hardy is amazing in what must have been a difficult role. Far removed from Praetor Shinzon in Star Trek Nemesis - now appearing much older physically, he has matured, and certainly beefed up for the role. But the strength of the performance lies in the depth of the portrayal.The monosyllabic narration scenes that seem to join sections of the story together draw you in and keep you compelled to watch and you believe the story. Hardy exudes an almost palpable menace, as he flicks from deep thought and introspective silence, even sadness to a violent boiling rage in the blink of an eye, truly scary.The violent scenes are unflinching and brutal, though not overdone or gratuitous. They are also unwavering in how they portray the futility of Bronson's actions, reinforcing his inner turmoil.Quite short at 92 minutes, it is nonetheless a powerful biopic, regardless of how accurate the material.I felt great sympathy for the character (which probably sounds misplaced for someone who attacked, injured and brutalized many prison guards) but the Director (and Hardy) elevate the story to a level above just violence.The scenes where he returns to his parents new smaller home now replete of his childhood belongings show an undercurrent of helpless, almost childlike loss and sadness for example.The film flicks between the narration and story scenes to Hardy playing out his life on a make believe music hall stage to a willing audience, giving a dreamy quality that probably prompted the comparisons to Kubrick, and Clockwork Orange.Accomplished author, artist and sculpture on the one hand, vicious psychotic thug on the other,  that never lets you know when he will flick from one to the other makes for memorable (if not always easy) viewing. 4 stars.",4,"""I only ever wanted to be famous""",1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,4509,"['very', 'difficult', 'describe',

1298592,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002XTXFU8,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 7]","But then again, this movie is kind of weird so I think that's okay.  In fact, I'm probably going to use that phrase a lot in this review since my revelations about this film have all come over me with a strange air of `weirdness'.This may sound weird, but when `Bronson' ended I instantly brought to mind `American Splendor'.  I know, they are SOOOO different, but the one thing they have in common is the one thing that makes them both so amazing; they are odd.  I guess I should elaborate.  They are odd takes on a generic genre.  All too often the biopic (which happens to be one of my favorite film genres) tends to become repetitive.  The same general plot outline is used in the storytelling, and unless the subject is interesting enough on their own and the performances are beyond stellar, they can all begin to run together.  `American Splendor' was one of those refreshing films that took be by surprise because it understood how to do something unique and different with the genre.  `Bronson' does that too.  It breaks away from the norm and delivers something that is odd.  Sure, that oddness may deter some and it isn't without detractors, but the way that the film uses comedic breaks and fantastical interludes and blistering techno savvy music makes `Bronson' stick out like a sore thumb.I gobbled it up.This may sound weird, but Tom Hardy is hot.  Ok, so that isn't weird par-say; but it is weird coming from me.  What I mean by that is that the man is a marvel of physical appearance.  The fact that he is naked often in this film (his battle outfit of choice) doesn't hurt either.  Apparently, if I do 2,500 push ups a day for five weeks I can look like him too.  I started yesterday.Breaking away from my obsession with his body (not an `I want to take him to bed obsession' but an `I wish I looked like him' obsession), the performance he delivers is FLAWLESS.  It's funny because I just got done raving Colin Firth for his marvelous performance in `A Single Man' (toting it as the best of last year) and I'm almost tempted to say that Hardy was better.  The performances are so different, yet they are both so complex.  The way that Hardy taps into the chaotic drive that lays springloaded in the back of Bronson's mind is intoxicating, and the way that he plays to the strengths of the oddness of the script is just spot on.  He really understands how to layer this character in all the right ways, creating multiple personalities that don't feel dislocated but at the same time never feel completely coherent.  It is also a vanity free performance (I mean, he looks amazing but there is not an ounce of validation there), a fearless one, and I always commend the actor who is willing to `go there'.Tom Hardy goes there, and then some.This may sound weird, but the fact that not all of this is true only makes this film all the more amazing.  I know that biopics get lamblasted at times for not staying true to reality, but the fact that Bronson's reality is one steeped in the fascination with fame makes the fabrication of his world all the more pertinent to understanding who he really is.  He is a celebrity, but not the usual kind.  He is the self imagined kind, and so making his world even more macabre helps us get inside his head and relish every moment of it.If you want something out of the norm that will touch you unexpectedly and stay with you longer than most other films, grab hold of `Bronson' and don't let it go!",5,This is going to sound weird...,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,3454,"['then', 'again', 'movie', 'kind', 'weird', 'think', 'okay', 'fact', ""'m"", 'probably', 'going', 'use', 'phrase', 'lot', 'review', 'revelations', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'strange', 'air', ""weirdness'.This"", 'may', 'sound', 'weird', 'when', 'Bronson', 'ended', 'instantly', 'brought', 'mind', 'American', 'Splendor', 'know', 'are', 'SOOOO', 'different', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'one', 'thing', 'so', 'amazing', 'are', 'odd', 'guess', 'should', 'elaborate', 'are', 'odd', 'generic', 'genre', 'too', 'often', 'biopic', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'film', 'genres', 'become', 'repetitive', 'same', 'general', 'plot', 'outline', 'used', 'storytelling', 'subject', 'interesting', 'enough', 'own', 'performances', 'are', 'stellar', 'can', 'begin', 'run', 'together', 'American', 'Splendor', 'was', 'one', 'refreshing', 'films', 'took', 'be', 'surprise', 'understood', 'how', 'do', 'something', 'unique', 'different', 'genre', 'Bronson', 'too', 'away', 'norm', 'delivers', 'something', 'odd', 'Sure', 'oddness', 'may', 'deter', ""n't"", 'detractors', 'way', 'film', 'comedic', 'breaks', 'fantastical', 'interludes', 'blistering', 'techno', 'savvy', 'music', 'Bronson', 'stick', 'sore', 'thumb.I', 'gobbled', 'up.This', 'may', 'sound', 'weird', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'hot', 'Ok', ""n't"", 'weird', 'par-say', 'weird', 'coming', 'What', 'mean', 'man', 'marvel', 'physical', 'appearance', 'fact', 'naked', 'often', 'film', 'battle', 'outfit', 'choice', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'Apparently', 'do', '2,500', 'push', 'ups', 'day', 'five', 'weeks', 'can', 'look', 'too', 'started', 'yesterday.Breaking', 'away', 'obsession', 'body', 'not', 'want', 'take', 'bed', 'obsession', 'wish', 'looked', 'obsession', 'performance', 'FLAWLESS', 'funny', 'just', 'got', 'done', 'raving', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Single', 'Man', 'toting', 'best', 'last', 'year', ""'m"", 'almost', 'tempted', 'say', 'Hardy', 'was', 'better', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'yet', 'are', 'so', 'complex', 'way', 'Hardy', 'chaotic', 'drive', 'springloaded', 'back', 'Bronson', 'mind', 'intoxicating', 'way', 'strengths', 'oddness', 'script', 'just', 'spot', 'really', 'how', 'layer', 'character', 'right', 'ways', 'creating', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'dislocated', 'same', 'time', 'never', 'feel', 'completely', 'coherent', 'also', 'vanity', 'free', 'performance', 'mean', 'amazing', 'not', 'ounce', 'validation', 'fearless', 'one', 'always', 'commend', 'actor', 'who', 'willing', 'go', ""there'.Tom"", 'Hardy', 'there', 'then', 'some.This', 'may', 'sound', 'weird', 'fact', 'not', 'true', 'only', 'film', 'more', 'amazing', 'know', 'biopics', 'get', 'lamblasted', 'times', 'not', 'staying', 'true', 'reality', 'fact', 'Bronson', 'reality', 'one', 'steeped', 'fascination', 'fame', 'fabrication', 'world', 'more', 'pertinent', 'understanding', 'who', 'really', 'celebrity', 'not', 'usual', 'kind', 'self', 'imagined', 'kind', 'so', 'making', 'world', 'even', 'more', 'macabre', 'get', 'head', 'relish', 'moment', 'it.If', 'want', 'something', 'norm', 'will', 'touch', 'unexpectedly', 'stay', 'longer', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'grab', 'hold', 'Bronson', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'go']",N/A
1298593,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B002XTXFU8,Armando N. Roman,"[9, 14]","Most people who know me know that Charles Bronson is pretty much my hero. Based on everything incredible the guy's done single-handedly: punching through bulletproof glass, doing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage to jail roofs, evacuating an entire prison when he took a teacher hostage, and his many records on push ups and sit ups...the guy is a legend. I've read a few of his books, and follow his Solitary Fitness program as much as I can. It took me a while before I watched the movie, since the trailer I saw wasn't exactly captivating. But after reading many reviews about how 'captivating' and 'amazing' this movie is, I finally gave it a shot. Let me tell you that if you watch this movie without any knowledge of Bronson himself, you're not going to get much out of it. And if you've read his books about prison life and how he's managed to get himself thrown back in time after time (in his book, Bronson), you'll probably wonder why the director and writer chose to skip over all the interesting parts of his life and decide to make a tribute to Stanley Kubrick instead.Because we all know the poor guy's still in prison, and that's where most of the movie takes place, it's hard to give a plot summary, especially given that there's no real plot. We start out with a brief background of Bronson's child life, showing that he wasn't abused or neglected by his parents or anything. He was just a ruffian from the get-go. Later on he robs a shop for very little money (I'm talkin' a few bucks here...well, pounds since he's in England) and ends up in jail for a few years. While in prison, Bronson makes a name for himself. Constantly fighting guards, beating up other prisoners, taking hostages, etc. He's moved from prison to prison and eventually to an asylum where he's drugged up, then moved to another prison and set free. But once he's out, Bronson robs another store, and goes back to prison again, starting the cycle all over again.See, it sounds like it should be interesting. And I wasn't going into this movie expecting an action/comedy or anything, though when I was done watching it, I think that might've been a better genre choice than what they went with. The movie misses everything, and ends up being more of an art house kinda deal more than anything. It's for the kind of person who watches A Clockwork Orange repeatedly, or tries to make sense of the stupidly little details that will never be explained in The Shining (omg why are there two coffee cups on the hotel manager's table before Jack gets his own?!?!). In the movie, it's hard to care much for Bronson since most of the time he's moping around or going crazy beating people up. Here and there, the movie cuts to scenes of him talking to an audience while wearing face paint and a nice suit, giving a brief narrative of what's going on or his thoughts. The problem is, after reading the book Bronson, this doesn't seem like it's the right guy. In the movie, he goes off about how he loves prison, but in the book, he constantly goes on about his miserable he was and how he desperately wanted to do things that we take for granted, like walking on grass or running on the beach. Is there anything like that here so we can identify with him, or make him seem more like a human? Nope. Even the part where he's drugged up in the asylum, which was a VERY big low point in the man's life, is over with in no time, and the scene's handled in such a bizarre way that I don't get why they even bothered to put it in here.Another thing that bugged me is how they didn't show anything regarding Bronson's superhuman feats. There are a few brief seconds of him doing push ups early on, but no mention of how many he can do. I know it seems petty, but read up on the guy's fitness regime and you'll see why it would've been nice to see something more than him punching guards for 5 seconds, talking to a dream-audience, or an awkward scene of Bronson visiting his uncle in a room full of women and men dressed as women, as he sits on a couch with no one else really saying anything, having a fancy drink. See? It's -art-! There's no explanation but since it's art, it must have some deep message that only the highly intellectual person will understand, right?! Had they tried to make this more of a biography movie, I would've handled it better. But as it stands, the only good things I can say about it are that Tom Hardy does resemble Charles a bit (though I don't get why he didn't dye his mustache black) and he got into very good shape for the part. That and some of the music is good. Otherwise, there's nothing I liked about this movie at all, and it hurts to say that about something based on the legend. I was never that interested in the movie, and wished it would end within the first 20 minutes. Stick with the books. At least there the scene where he fights a dog isn't cut off as soon as the dog's unleashed- there he straight up tells you about how he crammed his arm down the dog's mouth and ripped out part of its lung.The picture quality of the blu-ray is average. The movie's shot in a gritty style to match the content, so don't expect this to look as pristine as some of the newer movies where everything looks flawless. I actually saw some white spots on the print in some scenes too. The audio's a bit better, and makes great use of the DTS track, though this isn't an action movie that could use it to the full capability. The music and ambiance really sets the mood in some scenes that are otherwise dull. Whenever Bronson paces the cell in his chains, you really feel like he's circling around you, with the clink-clink-clink going around.The extras are surprisingly good, starting with an audio recording from the real Bronson himself. It plays for almost 20 minutes, and the kicker is that prison guards didn't know how it got recorded since visitors are heavily searched and remove nearly everything upon talking to him. What's funny is that if you listen to this right after watching the movie, you'll see that Tom Hardy doesn't really sound like Bronson that much. Then there's 48 minutes of interviews with the director, writer and stars that cover nearly everything you could want to know about the making of the movie, almost like a commentary track. There's a standard making-of feature, the trailer and some b-roll footage, nothing special. But my favorite feature aside from the audio recording is the short Training Tom Hardy extra. It goes into detail about how he trained for 5 weeks to get into as good of shape as The Bronco.All in all, the blu-ray might be fairly good, but the movie isn't. I'm sure I'll get comments with people telling me that I didn't 'get' the movie, but I really don't care. It was uninteresting and didn't capture the essence of the man. A gentle giant on one side, zero tolerance for being pushed around on the other. Again, I highly recommend at least reading his Solitary Fitness book to get a better idea of how strong the guy is, and reading the book Bronson to see that the guy isn't dull like he is here.",3,"All

I'm not one for weird, artsy movies, Eraserhead freaked the hell out of me and I didn't get it at all. BUT, this movie was well, weird in a way, but so is the subject, so it really is perfectly matched.  HisViolent. At times, ultra violent. I'm not crazy about it, but it is an integral part of Michael Peterson/Charles Bronson. He's also oddly charming at times and you want to like him.What hooked me first - the surreal circus quality to begin. I read about him before seeing the movie, so I couldn't imagine this would be the opening. Fascinating to me.What hooked  me viscerally - the juxtaposition of music and violence (ala Clockwork Orange, but also so different), ESPECIALLY the opening music ""The Electrician"" by the Walker Brothers - slooowed down the tiniest bit it produced that oooh feeling in my tummy. Oh my god, if you haven't heard that piece, visit you tube. But maybe it's just me that it gets to. Love it. Unfreakinbelievable almost sensuous at times. Not the violence, that doesn't 'do it' for me, but it was the way some of the scenes were so expertly crafted and involving more than just the senses of the eyes and ears.What kept me watching: his boyish charm throughout despite his extreme and at times pointless (to us) violence. It does appear that he just likes to be violent, just as someone else might like to play extreme sports or take risks. Sometimes, it seems that there's not even anger on his part. Sometimes, it's obvious that it's fear and he strikes out, and in doing so, tries to create maximum carnage - like in a game. I actually felt sorry for him at times.I also kept watching to see some kind of resolution and redemption. I wanted for him to get help and released from prison and live a happy, content life.He is at his most content while in prison, kind of ""in his element"". I think he's one of those people who just can't co-exist in ""polite society"". He tried.Sometimes, I feel like he got a raw deal because nobody knew what to do with him.  :/",5,"It is what it is and I loved it - artsy, dark, disturbing, funny, charming, surreal",1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,2087,"['Tom', 'Hardy', 'phenomenal', 'Bronson.I', 'loved', 'people', 'love', 'hate', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'weird', 'artsy', 'movies', 'Eraserhead', 'freaked', 'hell', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'BUT', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'weird', 'way', 'so', 'subject', 'really', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'HisViolent', 'times', 'ultra', 'violent', ""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'integral', 'part', 'Michael', 'Peterson/Charles', 'Bronson', 'also', 'oddly', 'charming', 'times', 'want', 'like', 'him.What', 'hooked', 'first', 'surreal', 'circus', 'quality', 'begin', 'read', 'seeing', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'would', 'be', 'opening', 'Fascinating', 'me.What', 'hooked', 'viscerally', 'juxtaposition', 'music', 'violence', 'ala', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'also', 'so', 'different', 'ESPECIALLY', 'opening', 'music', 'Electrician', 'Walker', 'Brothers', 'slooowed', 'tiniest', 'bit', 'produced', 'oooh', 'feeling', 'tummy', 'Oh', 'god', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'piece', 'visit', 'tube', 'maybe', 'just', 'Love', 'Unfreakinbelievable', 'almost', 'sensuous', 'times', 'Not', 'violence', ""n't"", ""'do"", 'was', 'way', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'involving', 'more', 'just', 'senses', 'eyes', 'kept', 'watching', 'boyish', 'charm', 'extreme', 'times', 'pointless', 'violence', 'appear', 'just', 'be', 'violent', 'just', 'someone', 'else', 'might', 'like', 'play', 'extreme', 'sports', 'take', 'risks', 'Sometimes', 'not', 'even', 'anger', 'part', 'Sometimes', 'obvious', 'fear', 'out', 'doing', 'so', 'tries', 'create', 'maximum', 'carnage', 'game', 'actually', 'felt', 'sorry', 'times.I', 'also', 'kept', 'watching', 'see', 'kind', 'resolution', 'redemption', 'wanted', 'get', 'help', 'released', 'prison', 'live', 'happy', 'content', 'life.He', 'most', 'content', 'prison', 'kind', 'element', 'think', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'co-exist', 'polite', 'society', 'feel', 'got', 'raw', 'deal', 'nobody', 'knew', 'what', 'do', '/']",N/A

There is a surreal feeling that permeates throughout which, is indicative of the world that Charlie Bronson lives in.This movie is a narrative of a sad figure, Michael Peterson who wants nothing more than to be famous ... for something. He ""Can't sing, can't act"" so, in his words, he's short of options. A bungled armed robbery puts him away for seven years that become decades due to his desire to be famous. That fame, manifests itself as his desire to be Britain's most violent criminal. So violent that he spends 30+ years of his term in solitary due to hostage taking, constant attacks of staff and inmates and rioting.Changing his name to Charlie Bronson, after the film star, Peterson's surreal world is understood only by him. Those who try to peel away any of his layers feel his wrath. To say Peterson is his own worst enemy is to misunderstand him. Peterson, defines himself by his ability to strike fear into anyone, friend or foe. The system is not his enemy, the system is what allows him to be famous. The system enables him.Watch the movie with an open mind. It's art is its strength, the subject is secondary.

1298609,A18D0R137EYS6C,B002XTXFU8,Clinton Enlow,"[4, 7]","Bronson was one of my favorite if not my favorite film from last year so it was an easy purchase to make this one of the first Blu-Rays I owned that I wasn't re-purchasing from DVD. Like its protagonist Bronson isn't an easy film to explain.On one hand you can say its a biopic of Michael Peterson, a british prisoner who has rechristend himself in his fighting name of Charles Bronson and made a name for himself by causing riots and taking hostages so many times He's now serving a life sentence in his own prison to protect guards and other convicts from him. The movie isn't so simple though taking what I call a more gonzo approach to the idea of a biopic of a man who's so off kilter a personality. The best critics and even director Nicolas Winding Refn admit that the film is operating on different levels. The normal biopic features Peterson narrating his life, the story of young man who leads an existence engaging in fights at an early age until at nineteen He decides to rob a post office. He's sentenced to seven years in prison and once in decides to make the most of it engaing in fights and other violence.Then theres another angle as Bronson puts on a suit, paints his face and narrates his life story to a crowd, telling jokes and basically as He says from his opening becoming famous through his actions as a prisoner. This is more the surreal aspect of the film exploring a duality between the personality and the person I found interesting. Even the lifestory reenactments seem to use a technique. The film opens on a vicious fight with a caged Bronson squaring off against six guards scored to a normal song that does provide the feeling of general disturbance of the man. Certain scenes want to show this reality while the movie switches soundtracks to a more classical score when Bronson is retelling his life becoming more of the showman He wants to be. We go from rock and roll to Wagner at the drop of a hat to emphasize a more larger than life quality to the story.Refn's an interesting director who totatlly seems to have changed his direction from his films like the Pusher series which were more realistic compared to this. This change of tone and style definitely makes him a filmmaker I'm more interested in seeing after this film but I'll be remiss if I didn't mention Tom Hardy's performance. The film has become mainly recognized for Hardy's work reminiscent to Eric Bana as Mark Brandon Read in Chopper. Unlike Bana who became known outside of Australia because of Chopper though, Hardy's been working for nearly ten years in films like Black Hawk Down and Layer Cake. He's mostly been a character actor in small roles gaining some leads in other films. After this though I can definitely see this changing as He totally owns his role as Bronson. He bulked up considerably shaved his head, but more than that He has an almost animal intensity in the performance. He's funny, He's brash but at the end you do in a way see the wounded animal existing underneath the persona- again something reminiscent of Bana's performance in Bronson. I enjoyed Refn's direction but I can definitely recommend the film from the performance of the lead actor.The film is a biopic of an interesting person that thankfully doesn't glorify the man. There is a free Bronson campaign but it never seems to argue for this idea. In the end its a entertaining film with great direction and an amazing performance. Like I said this is one of the first Blus I purchased so I'm not as good at others at judging picture and the like. I've heard some reviews that have said the pictures good but not great but to me the picture popped with an amazing ammount of sharpness and detail while still retaining a film like appearance. The sound though is spectacularly good benefiting the dialogue and music selection. Magnolia thankfully isn't a company that skimps on extras for either DVD or Blu-Ray and there is a great selection of features including a making of that includes some of Bronson's family, select interviews with Refn, Hardy and actor Matt King. Theres also a feature on training Tom Hardy as well as behind the scenes footage and everything is rounded out with recorded monologues from Charles Bronson himself. The last feature should be something interesting like interviews with Mark Read were on Chopper, but truthfully asides from the rambling nature the audio isn't very good.Thats a good ammount of material rounding out an excellent disc. Like I said I loved the film and would definitely recommend the Blu Ray for fans of the movie. However you can see the movie though its a definite recommendation from me.",5,Bronson,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,4636,"['Bronson', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'not', 'favorite', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'easy', 'purchase', 'make', 'one', 'first', 'Blu-Rays', 'owned', 'was', ""n't"", 're-purchasing', 'DVD', 'protagonist', 'Bronson', ""n't"", 'easy', 'film', 'explain.On', 'one', 'hand', 'can', 'say', 'biopic', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'british', 'prisoner', 'who', 'rechristend', 'fighting', 'name', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'made', 'name', 'causing', 'riots', 'taking', 'hostages', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'now', 'serving', 'life', 'sentence', 'own', 'prison', 'protect', 'guards', 'other', 'convicts', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'simple', 'taking', 'what', 'call', 'more', 'gonzo', 'approach', 'idea', 'biopic', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'off', 'kilter', 'personality', 'best', 'critics', 'even', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'admit', 'film', 'operating', 'different', 'levels', 'normal', 'biopic', 'features', 'Peterson', 'narrating', 'life', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'existence', 'engaging', 'fights', 'early', 'age', 'nineteen', 'rob', 'post', 'office', 'sentenced', 'seven', 'years', 'prison', 'once', 'decides', 'make', 'most', 'engaing', 'fights', 'other', 'violence.Then', 'angle', 'Bronson', 'suit', 'face', 'life', 'story', 'crowd', 'telling', 'jokes', 'basically', 'opening', 'becoming', 'famous', 'actions', 'prisoner', 'more', 'surreal', 'aspect', 'film', 'exploring', 'duality', 'personality', 'person', 'found', 'interesting', 'Even', 'lifestory', 'reenactments', 'seem', 'use', 'technique', 'film', 'vicious', 'fight', 'caged', 'Bronson', 'squaring', 'off', 'six', 'guards', 'scored', 'normal', 'song', 'provide', 'feeling', 'general', 'disturbance', 'man', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'want', 'show', 'reality', 'movie', 'soundtracks', 'more', 'classical', 'score', 'when', 'Bronson', 'retelling', 'life', 'becoming', 'more', 'showman', 'be', 'go', 'rock', 'roll', 'Wagner', 'drop', 'hat', 'emphasize', 'more', 'larger', 'life', 'quality', 'story.Refn', 'interesting', 'director', 'who', 'totatlly', 'have', 'changed', 'direction', 'films', 'Pusher', 'series', 'were', 'more', 'realistic', 'compared', 'change', 'tone', 'style', 'definitely', 'filmmaker', ""'m"", 'more', 'interested', 'seeing', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'performance', 'film', 'become', 'mainly', 'recognized', 'Hardy', 'work', 'reminiscent', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Mark', 'Brandon', 'Read', 'Chopper', 'Bana', 'who', 'became', 'known', 'Australia', 'Chopper', 'Hardy', 'been', 'working', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'films', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'mostly', 'been', 'character', 'actor', 'small', 'roles', 'gaining', 'leads', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'changing', 'totally', 'role', 'Bronson', 'bulked', 'up', 'considerably', 'shaved', 'head', 'more', 'almost', 'animal', 'intensity', 'performance', 'funny', 'brash', 'end', 'do', 'way', 'see', 'wounded', 'animal', 'existing', 'persona-', 'again', 'something', 'reminiscent', 'Bana', 'performance', 'Bronson', 'enjoyed', 'Refn', 'direction', 'can', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'performance', 'lead', 'actor.The', 'film', 'biopic', 'interesting', 'person', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'glorify', 'man', 'free', 'Bronson', 'campaign', 'never', 'argue', 'idea', 'end', 'entertaining', 'film', 'great', 'direction', 'amazing', 'performance', 'said', 'one', 'first', 'Blus', 'purchased', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'judging', 'picture', 'like', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'pictures', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'picture', 'popped', 'amazing', 'ammount', 'sharpness', 'detail', 'still', 'retaining', 'film', 'appearance', 'sound', 'spectacularly', 'good', 'benefiting', 'dialogue', 'music', 'selection', 'Magnolia', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'company', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'great', 'selection', 'features', 'including', 'making', 'Bronson', 'family', 'select', 'interviews', 'Refn', 'Hardy', 'actor', 'Matt', 'King', 'Theres', 'also', 'feature', 'training', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'footage', 'everything', 'rounded', 'out', 'recorded', 'monologues', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'last', 'feature', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'Mark', 'Read', 'were', 'Chopper', 'truthfully', 'asides', 'rambling', 'nature', 'audio', ""n't"", 'very', 'good.Thats', 'good', 'ammount', 'material', 'rounding', 'out', 'excellent', 'disc', 'said', 'loved', 'film', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'fans', 'movie', 'However', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'definite', 'recommendation']",N/A

And honestly the one question that plagues my mind after watching this.. What did Bronson want? Was it really to gain simple fame? To leave a mark on society as a whole? Because hey a movie was made after him, he has some books out, and is still apparently by this film, in prison. But we all now know of him. At least a good chunk of people.I mean, the only thing he does through out the whole film, is beat people up. Locations change... But all he seems to do, is just beat up prison guards, and get beat up. What's he after? To find that breaking point of his? And later on in the film, the dude gets buck naked. yes, and has a guard rub .. some paste onto him? Its white. And then at a later point, he gets covered in black paint. Which maybe has some sort of...symbolic meaning? The reason I bring this up, hopefully someone will read my review and give me a heads up, is because he is on stage as well several times through out the movie, talking to the audience. I figure the two are connected.And if he liked beating people up so much, why didn't he just get into boxing? At least then he'd been facing people that were his equal match and earning money.One thing I want to mention is the movie isn't your standard fare. It doesn't really have a ending. It just stops. And its an oddball movie in its pacing. (Maybe their was a lot that was cut?)

I believe that the fellow has spent some 30y in nick (transferred from one institution to the next as his welcome wore out) most of which time was done in solitary.The film portrays this unsavoury character as a caricature, often breaking the fourth wall and playing him directly to the viewer (and even, wearing whiteface, to a fictitious, on-screen audience). This may seem odd and off the wall, but from what little I know of the real Charles Bronson, he was (is) a larger than life show-man, an overdone self-caricature so, in many ways the film may not be far from the truth in its depiction of the man. It is certainly uneasy viewing and I found myself liking the guy for his eccentricities, forgetting the real reason for his notoriety. Of course this is soon (and frequently) rectified as the film doesn't shy away from his nastier tendencies and the violence, itself almost stylised, comes thick, fast and extreme.The film is certainly dominated by Tom Hardy's spellbindingly excellent depiction of a dangerously unstable and hugely unpredictable, yet deeply charming thug. Hardy clearly threw himself into the role with some brio and he conveys this strange mixture of attributes cerebrally AND athletically. The remainder of the cast is very much scenery dressing although, to be fair, their personalities are rather overshadowed by the larger-than-life central character.In the end, although it makes no attempt to excuse Bronson of his faults, the film does rather appear to skirt around the edges of glorifying his violent behaviour and an impressionable viewer could come away from the film thinking of the man as a bit of an anti-hero. ""You're pitiful"", Bronson's prison governor says to him and it's hard to disagree that any man who, pretty much out of choice, spent the majority of his life behind bars IS pitiful.An interesting, disturbing semi-fictional biopic of an interesting, disturbed and (probably) semi-fictional character.Recommended, but approach with caution, especially as you get to see rather more of Mr Hardy's ""old chap"" than is perhaps savoury before the watershed (or after it, for that matter)...",4,'e's a bit of a lad - a geezer,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,2299,"['Charles', 'Bronson', 'born', 'Aberystwith', 'Mickey', 'Peterson', 'was', 'one', 'Britain', 'most', 'notorious', 'prisoners', 'dint', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'violent', 'incarcerates', 'believe', 'fellow', 'spent', '30y', 'nick', 'transferred', 'one', 'institution', 'next', 'welcome', 'wore', 'out', 'most', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'solitary.The', 'film', 'unsavoury', 'character', 'caricature', 'often', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'playing', 'directly', 'viewer', 'even', 'wearing', 'whiteface', 'fictitious', 'on-screen', 'audience', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'wall', 'what', 'little', 'know', 'real', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'was', 'larger', 'life', 'show-man', 'overdone', 'self-caricature', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'far', 'truth', 'depiction', 'man', 'certainly', 'uneasy', 'viewing', 'found', 'liking', 'guy', 'eccentricities', 'forgetting', 'real', 'reason', 'notoriety', 'course', 'soon', 'frequently', 'rectified', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'nastier', 'tendencies', 'violence', 'almost', 'stylised', 'thick', 'fast', 'extreme.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'dominated', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'spellbindingly', 'excellent', 'depiction', 'dangerously', 'unstable', 'hugely', 'unpredictable', 'yet', 'deeply', 'charming', 'thug', 'Hardy', 'clearly', 'threw', 'role', 'brio', 'strange', 'mixture', 'attributes', 'cerebrally', 'AND', 'athletically', 'remainder', 'cast', 'very', 'much', 'scenery', 'dressing', 'be', 'fair', 'personalities', 'are', 'rather', 'overshadowed', 'larger-than-life', 'central', 'character.In', 'end', 'attempt', 'excuse', 'Bronson', 'faults', 'film', 'rather', 'appear', 'skirt', 'edges', 'glorifying', 'violent', 'behaviour', 'impressionable', 'viewer', 'could', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'thinking', 'man', 'bit', 'anti-hero', ""'re"", 'pitiful', 'Bronson', 'prison', 'governor', 'hard', 'disagree', 'man', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'choice', 'spent', 'majority', 'life', 'bars', 'IS', 'pitiful.An', 'interesting', 'disturbing', 'semi-fictional', 'biopic', 'interesting', 'disturbed', 'probably', 'semi-fictional', 'character.Recommended', 'approach', 'caution', 'especially', 'get', 'see', 'rather', 'more', 'Mr', 'Hardy', 'old', 'chap', 'perhaps', 'savoury', 'watershed', 'matter']",N/A

There's a loose hypothesis afloat among evolutionary psychologists that extreme sociopathic behavior is ""within the norms"" of human psychology and might have been highly adaptive among early humans -- stone age and earlier pre-H. sapiens. That such hyper-violent people exist, and that they are often endowed with exceptional abilities, is not in doubt. Charlie Bronson, labeled by the tabloid press as the most violent prison inmate in Great Britain, might well have thrived in another cultural framework, in the continual inter-tribal violence of Papua New Guinea, or as a berserker in pre-Christian Scandinavia. He might have been a chief. One wonders, given a different environment, whether Charlie Bronson could have been another Shaka Zulu or Crazy Horse. The real life Michael Peterson is possibly more ""impressive"" that the fictive Bronson of this film. He was married twice, for instance. He converted to Islam, then apostatized. He writes poetry and books about fitness regimens; he's had eleven books published, winning several awards. Don't for a second believe, however, that he has somehow become someone safe to share a space with! He's been involved in over a dozen violent hostage-takings, including one as recently as 2007.Charlie is a very violent dude, no doubt of it. If he'd been a Californian, he'd have been sent to the prison called Pelican Bay, and I can assure you he'd be long dead by now because there are others of his ilk. The competition is fierce for being the baddest. The fact that he has spent thirty years in ""solitary confinement"" is the sole reason for his survival. This film is therefore, in a secondary way, an expose of the dysfunctional side of the British prisons. Only the truth that there is no normal means to handle someone like Charlie prevents the viewer from interpreting this film as an indictment of the justice and penal systems. But one is distracted by the bizarre horror of Charlie's personality.The film, however, isn't a thorough documentary of the career of Michael Peterson. Much is ignored and some is imagined. There's a framework around the story: Bronson is seen addressing an applauding audience, diagnosing himself for their ""appreciation"", miming and masqueing his own identity, sometimes in clown make-up, often smiling like a kung fu Cheshire Cat, exulting in the ""public's fascination"" with his rage. One could more easily imagine King Kong being given the stage; this is somebody's fantasy, but you'll need to parse for yourself whether it represents Charlie's or director Nicolas Winding Refn's narcissism. You'll also need to wonder about the blatantly psychotic homophobia in the film, whether it represents a causative factor in Charlie's sociopathy or whether its ""meaning"" is something the director needs to express. Or both. Most of the wardens and other figures of ""control"" are assertively effeminate. Who knows? There's not much that's explicit and unambiguous about this portrayal of Charlie Bronson. But there's an enormous challenge in the film, a gauntlet thrown down to the public which seems to be insatiable in its craving for films of extreme violence. Here's the real thing, the film seems to say, bloodlust irrational violence of a sort that YOU couldn't handle for a second, and how would you like that, you soft-bellied masturbatory fantacist?",5,Evolutionary Psychologists ...,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,3473,"['would', 'probably', 'be', 'interested', 'mind', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'also', 'known', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'Perhaps', 'already', 'study', 'loose', 'hypothesis', 'afloat', 'evolutionary', 'psychologists', 'extreme', 'sociopathic', 'behavior', 'norms', 'human', 'psychology', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'highly', 'adaptive', 'early', 'humans', 'stone', 'age', 'earlier', 'pre-H.', 'sapiens', 'such', 'hyper-violent', 'people', 'exist', 'are', 'often', 'endowed', 'exceptional', 'abilities', 'not', 'doubt', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'labeled', 'tabloid', 'press', 'most', 'violent', 'prison', 'inmate', 'Great', 'Britain', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'thrived', 'cultural', 'framework', 'continual', 'inter-tribal', 'violence', 'Papua', 'New', 'Guinea', 'berserker', 'pre-Christian', 'Scandinavia', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'chief', 'One', 'wonders', 'given', 'different', 'environment', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'real', 'life', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'possibly', 'more', 'impressive', 'fictive', 'Bronson', 'film', 'was', 'married', 'twice', 'instance', 'converted', 'Islam', 'then', 'apostatized', 'poetry', 'books', 'fitness', 'regimens', 'had', 'eleven', 'books', 'published', 'winning', 'several', 'awards', 'Do', ""n't"", 'second', 'believe', 'however', 'somehow', 'become', 'someone', 'safe', 'share', 'space', 'been', 'involved', 'dozen', 'violent', 'hostage-takings', 'including', 'one', 'as', 'recently', '2007.Charlie', 'very', 'violent', 'dude', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'been', 'Californian', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'prison', 'called', 'Pelican', 'Bay', 'can', 'assure', ""'d"", 'be', 'long', 'dead', 'now', 'are', 'others', 'ilk', 'competition', 'fierce', 'being', 'baddest', 'fact', 'spent', 'thirty', 'years', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'sole', 'reason', 'survival', 'film', 'therefore', 'secondary', 'way', 'expose', 'dysfunctional', 'side', 'British', 'prisons', 'Only', 'truth', 'normal', 'handle', 'someone', 'Charlie', 'viewer', 'interpreting', 'film', 'indictment', 'justice', 'penal', 'systems', 'one', 'distracted', 'bizarre', 'horror', 'Charlie', 'personality.The', 'film', 'however', ""n't"", 'thorough', 'documentary', 'career', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'Much', 'ignored', 'imagined', 'framework', 'story', 'Bronson', 'seen', 'addressing', 'applauding', 'audience', 'diagnosing', 'appreciation', 'miming', 'masqueing', 'own', 'identity', 'sometimes', 'clown', 'make-up', 'often', 'smiling', 'kung', 'fu', 'Cheshire', 'Cat', 'exulting', 'public', 'fascination', 'rage', 'One', 'could', 'more', 'easily', 'imagine', 'King', 'Kong', 'being', 'given', 'stage', 'somebody', 'fantasy', ""'ll"", 'need', 'parse', 'Charlie', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'narcissism', ""'ll"", 'also', 'need', 'wonder', 'blatantly', 'psychotic', 'homophobia', 'film', 'causative', 'factor', 'Charlie', 'sociopathy', 'meaning', 'something', 'director', 'express', 'Most', 'wardens', 'other', 'figures', 'control', 'are', 'assertively', 'effeminate', 'Who', 'not', 'much', 'explicit', 'unambiguous', 'portrayal', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'enormous', 'challenge', 'film', 'gauntlet', 'thrown', 'down', 'public', 'be', 'insatiable', 'craving', 'films', 'extreme', 'violence', 'Here', 'real', 'thing', 'film', 'say', 'bloodlust', 'irrational', 'violence', 'sort', 'YOU', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'second', 'how', 'would', 'soft-bellied', 'masturbatory', 'fantacist']",N/A

His constant changes between ""laughing and serious,"" ""sad and violent,"" ""neurotic and violent,"" ""goofy and angry,"" simply were not realistic. It always ended up looking like a theater actor trying hard to act like he was criminally insane. Interspersed between the drab and disconnected snapshots of this man's life were some very odd scenes where he was performing in front of an audience. I never did figure that one out. I just couldn't waste another minute watching this waste of time. It was not clever. It was not artsy. It was not realistic, not in the least. It was not a movie. It was some dudes with some cameras who set up some scenes and strung them together. It was humorous at a few points, but for all the wrong reasons. The actor/character was a buffoon.I watched ""Bronson"" for free on Amazon Prime and did not have access to subtitles.

The film is directed by the man who gave us the outstanding gangster movie Drive recently, a Dane with a name like a typo: Refn.The life that we learn about is that of a man who has spent 30 years in solitary confinement. The final screen of the movie, which was produced in 2008, tells us that he is still there.Before you build up any sympathy or pity for the poor victim, have a look at this man, Michael Peterson, Britain's most violent prisoner. In the course of his career he raises the moniker to Britain's most expensive prisoner.He is a violent monster with a total lack of normal social behavior. Initially jailed for a post office robbery, he develops a liking for the prison cell, his 'hotel'. He fights with his jailers whenever he can. He is moved to the 'funny house', where he tries to kill a pedophile. In his next institution he gets to start a large scale riot. Released from prison, he starts a new career as a bare-knuckle fighter and changes his name to Charles Bronson. He is incarcerated again after a jewelry store robbery, 69 days after his release.But, as I said, this is not a normal biopic. We are not obliged to believe everything. It is not told like a normal story. It is probably not the full story anyway.Bronson tells us his story himself, or rather, actor Tom Hardy does. He does it, partly, on a stage, with an audience, acting with masks and with pantomime scenes, some quite brilliant. He does it partly sitting in a cell or a cage, often beaten up and bloody, always proud to be a hellhound.The tale is sometimes funny and then tends to dive into nauseating depths of black or yukki humor.The whole arrangement is a bit like a piece of Brechtian theater. Verfremdung is used advantageously and entertainingly. Macky Messer was a choir boy against Bronson.Many of the most brutal scenes are enhanced by operatic music. I am not expert enough in this genre, and I haven't figured out the musical score, but I assume that it uses a lot of Wagner. The music combines opera with techno.

Tom Hardy (Praetor Shinzon from Star Trek: Nemesis) is brilliant in his role, as he channels Britain's ""hardest"" criminal.The film covers Mike Peterson (aka Charlie Bronson) career in England's criminal justice system. You can learn more about Bronson's life by reading his Wiki entry, his freebronson website, and his other books. For myself, I had some empathy for his character. He went in to do hard time, but clearly the environment of prison, brought out Bronson's worst (best?) qualities, and his life spiraled downhill, the longer he was inside.Of special note is his run-in with forensic psychiatry. The folks at Broadmoor/Rampton had no idea what Bronson's problem was, nor how to treat him. I could tell you how best to treat a guy like Mr. Bronson. Leave him the hell alone. The solitary cells he spends most of his time in, isn't good for your soul, and you are not going to heal your head and heart, in jail or a psych hospital, because they are traumatizing and oppressive environments. And yes, I say this from personal experience.Anyway, his acting portrayal of what it is like to be treated with an antipsychotic is spot on. Bronson got Thorazine.

Director Refn's unique vision and Brady's incredible performance as Bronson make this a truly special film that will delight some and no doubt sicken others. In any case, it's a piece of cinematic brilliance that raises all sorts of questions and answers almost none of them, with much drama and glee.This guy is the very definition of sociopath, yet he's a hero to many in his native country. My main question in watching this is how do the guards get suckered into his grasp time and again; certainly a very different prison system from America's, where this sort of fellow would be shut down immediately. Yet the willingness to try to fathom Bronson's mind and heart are what perhaps makes Britain a more humane place. Or maybe not, when criminals have more rights than their victims? Yet another quandary hardly even addressed here. Like most of the judgments, it's up to you.What is certain is that Hardy and Refn gave this their all, and the various weird but effectively matched techniques that Refn uses are always in keeping with Brady's oddly nuanced performance. There's plenty of violence, but it's all realistic, non-Hollywood bare-knuckle stuff, with hardly a gun fired. The violence will be too much for some, but as much as I don't love violence I thought it was well done here and always worked towards the film's message. Still not sure what that is, but it was a trip to watch it all play out.Beautifully shot and thoroughly ugly at the same time, Bronson is one of a kind, and Brady's star turn is one of the most bravura acting jobs I've seen in years. If you can stomach a fair bit of fisticuffs, and a look at a mind that's unlike any you've ever encountered, Bronson may be an experience you'll not soon forget. And rarely will you feel better about law enforcement, knowing that society does well to have places to keep folks like Charlie well away from everyone else.",4,Brilliant film that's less disturbing than it probably should be,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,2034,"['4.3', 'starsThe', 'real-life', 'Bronson', 'quite', 'celebrity', 'Britain', 'apparently', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'pond', 'wild', 'film', 'Director', 'Refn', 'unique', 'vision', 'Brady', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Bronson', 'make', 'truly', 'special', 'film', 'will', 'delight', 'doubt', 'others', 'case', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'brilliance', 'sorts', 'questions', 'answers', 'almost', 'none', 'much', 'drama', 'glee.This', 'guy', 'very', 'definition', 'sociopath', 'hero', 'many', 'native', 'country', 'main', 'question', 'watching', 'how', 'do', 'guards', 'get', 'suckered', 'grasp', 'time', 'again', 'certainly', 'very', 'different', 'prison', 'system', 'America', 'where', 'sort', 'fellow', 'would', 'be', 'shut', 'down', 'immediately', 'willingness', 'try', 'fathom', 'Bronson', 'mind', 'heart', 'are', 'what', 'perhaps', 'Britain', 'more', 'humane', 'place', 'maybe', 'not', 'when', 'criminals', 'have', 'more', 'rights', 'victims', 'Yet', 'quandary', 'hardly', 'even', 'addressed', 'here', 'most', 'judgments', 'up', 'you.What', 'certain', 'Hardy', 'Refn', 'gave', 'various', 'weird', 'effectively', 'matched', 'techniques', 'Refn', 'uses', 'are', 'always', 'keeping', 'Brady', 'oddly', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'plenty', 'violence', 'realistic', 'non-Hollywood', 'bare-knuckle', 'stuff', 'hardly', 'gun', 'fired', 'violence', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'as', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'violence', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'here', 'always', 'worked', 'film', 'message', 'Still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'trip', 'watch', 'play', 'out.Beautifully', 'shot', 'thoroughly', 'ugly', 'same', 'time', 'Bronson', 'one', 'kind', 'Brady', 'star', 'turn', 'one', 'most', 'bravura', 'acting', 'jobs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'can', 'stomach', 'fair', 'bit', 'fisticuffs', 'look', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'Bronson', 'may', 'be', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'rarely', 'will', 'feel', 'better', 'law', 'enforcement', 'knowing', 'society', 'well', 'have', 'places', 'keep', 'folks', 'Charlie', 'well', 'away', 'everyone', 'else']",N/A

The movie ""Bronson"" achieves what can only be described as a visual feast of an epic life of monumental disparities. Tom Hardy, whom I believe is one of, if not Britain's finest actor, becomes Charlie. Every movement, every breath, the famous grin, the rage of the man himself is all there on the screen. Physically the resemblance to Charlie is almost unnerving, the slope of those massive shoulders, the shaven head and again...that unforgettable smile!Like most of us, before this movie I knew nothing of the man who strikes fear in the most brutal and hardened of men in Britain's prison system. After the movie I sent for Charlie's books, which if you find the man as intriguing as I do, you will also. Here is a man of formidable strength both physical and spiritual. This is a soul who recognises his own weaknesses and holds himself accountable. Yes, Charlie even relishes in his notoriety and fame, and believe me he IS famous : ) Please remember, this bear of a man has never killed anyone, never harmed a woman or a child!A tortured soul in a rock solid frame, somewhere between the circus strong man and the circus clown, the man called Bronson reminds me of a poem...""What immortal hand or eye, Could frame thy fearful symmetry..."" Charlie was born, no, created to be different, to hold a rage so powerful no earthly soul could hope to contain it, to own a heart so gentle only an immortal could have forged it. Well, sleeping tigers should not be awakened and when you piss-off Charlie watch out! He takes hostages. He rips off roofs of prisons and holds the whole of Britain in awe as he steals some free, fresh air blessed hours in the sun and consequently loses more years in jail! Here is the man who fears literally no one on this Earth! God bless you Charlie! It's like trying to contain a tornado...not going to happen!I am encouraging you to watch or buy this movie. You will be introduced to one of creation's most fascinating people. Enjoy the superb cinematography of this film. Marvel at the character which Tom Hardy has so electrically embodied.

In the hands of any less an actor than Tom Hardy, and with any less perfomance form his supporting cast, this movie probably wouldn't have been very good at all. But fortunately, every person rises magnificently to the task of filling the story with its offbeat, sleazy, and sometimes criminally dangerous characters, and turns this from a self-indulgent gore porn to something fascinating, a trip into a broken from birth mind.Bronson is insane, haughty, and completely in love with himself. And while this isn't a new concept in movies for an antagonist, the strange wonder of this film is that Bronson is our protagonist (anti-hero, whatever you want to call him). But the kicker is that when you delve into his mind the way this film does, you realize two things: first, that there is no deep-seeded reason why he acts the way he does outside of making a name for himself and the sheer jollies he gets from it, and two, you don't really hate him for it. In fact, you feel like all the character wants is for you to hear his story and know it, and not going beyond that makes you able to make a lot of decisions on your own.The pacing is good, the story told linearly, but its bizarre. In a good way, of course, but very very bizarre and violent, and darkly comedic. Bronson is a complex character who seems unreal, but still gets grounded in his own humanity form time to time, especially as he ages.This movie is a must-see for Tom Hardy fans, but is not for the feint of heart. If you do watch it, be preparred for lots of violence, lots of really foul (to the point that it makes you laugh then feel bad about laughing), and LOTS of seeing Tom Hardy naked. Lots of it.All in all, if you can take the brutal nature of this film, give it a shot.

The story itself, about one of the most famous prisoners in the British penal system is really not very deep.  Bronson is a guy that is more comfortable in prison than out in the world, that much is made clear, but it never really goes beyond that as to why that is the case.  The movie is a little repetitive in that the basic story is that Bonson attacks guards and prison officials at almost every opportunity that he has.  They move him from prison to prison and put him in solitary, but it is the same cycle.  I realize that this is actually the truth and close to reality for 30 years in real life, but that repeated cycle does not make for an engaging story. 3 stars.With all that being said, Tom Hardy is masterful in his portrayal of a clearly disturbed individual.  Everything about him is almost unrecognizable.  His expressions, movement, and gait are all transformative.  What an outstanding performance, especially since there are many segments in which he is essentially doing a one man show in front of an imaginary audience.  The closest thing that I can think of in relation to inhabiting a character would be Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York (oddly enough, a character with a similar facial look).

1298672,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B002XTXFU8,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[23, 27]","Everyone has heard of Charles Bronson.  Well, THAT Charles Bronson anyway, the title character here is definitely a far cry from the hardened film hero of the same name.  This Charlie Bronson was originally born Michael Peterson, who despite having a decent upbringing, grew up to be a criminal, and much, much more surprisingly.  Known as Britain's most notorious prisoner, Bronson manages to capture the ferocity of the man with tongue-in-cheek humor and sheer unpredictable moments.  Tom Hardy, who has been in quite a bit ranging from Star Trek: Nemesis, Layer Cake, and Rocknrolla among others, gives a star-making performance that should be seen to be believed.  Besides undergoing a physical transformation in bulking up, Hardy's performance may very well be akin to what Eric Bana managed to do some years ago with Chopper, in which he ironically enough, played famous prisoner Mark ""Chopper"" Read.

1298676,A6B92PTV0Z1SU,B002XTXFU8,"P. Kingsriter ""R.N. Guy""","[9, 11]","""Bronson"" is based on the real life of a man often referred to as ""the most violent prisoner in Britain"".  ""Charlie Bronson"" is a moniker the prisoner (real name: Michael Peterson) assumed as a sort of stage name.  According to the film, Peterson desired to be famous and went about garnering that fame by perpetuating heinously violent actions against other prisoners and prison guards.The film is bloody, violent, disturbing, and incredibly effective.  Tom Hardy is a powerhouse in the role in every sense of the word.  He's an imposing figure to start.  His powerfully built wrestler's physique makes the improbabilities of his physical altercations believable.  He captures the audience's attention in a stranglehold of a performance, playing straight a role that could have easily turned into an insane human cartoon.  Instead we watch a credibly complex sociopathic character unfold who is apparently choosy about upon whom he will wreck his carnage (primarily the heavily armed and numerous prison guards).  His mirthless laughter at the beginning of the film puts the audience off-kilter, not quite able to regain balance until some time after the end credits roll.  You're never quite sure what Hardy's Bronson is going to do next.  He's so pitch perfect throughout the film, it's hard to take your eyes off this living disaster.The film is essentially presented from Bronson's point of view, which lends itself to some strange storytelling considering his sociopathic bent.  Some self-narrated fantasy asides are at first quite bizarre as they're occurring with Bronson telling his story on stage in full makeup.  There is a heavy dose ofA Clockwork Orange-style cinematography, especially when Bronson is committed to a truly bizarre mental institution.  Again, this could be interpreted as Bronson's views of the situation, not how they actually were.  There's also an odd measure of homo-eroticism in the film -- Bronson seems to attract the attention of gay men, albeit never has any semblance of romantic reciprocation -- and you'll see more than one fully nude shot of Tom Hardy's man-bits including a scene where he commandeers a male prison librarian to give him a full-body butter rubdown to make him more difficult to handle in the upcoming fight.I couldn't quite put my finger on whether or not director Nicolas Winding Refn finds Bronson to be a sympathetic character (a little off-putting in itself), but it's obvious that Refn is fascinated with Bronson's complexities.  One can't help but feel that Bronson deserves every last brutal beating he receives at the hands, feet, and batons of the prison guards, as he is presented as the exclusive instigator of each outpouring of violence.  The last image of Bronson, bloodied and confined in a solitary cage, whimpering like a wounded animal, is bound to stick with you for a while.Bronson is brutal, but fascinating to watch, walking a thin line that dispassionately presents a violent life without glorifying the perpetrator.  It'll most likely make you uncomfortable, but then again, how else would you portray a guy who wanted to get famous by fashioning the persona of Britain's most violent prisoner?",4,"Bloody, Violent, Disturbing, and Incredibly Effective",1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,3178,"['Bronson', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'man', 'often', 'referred', 'most', 'violent', 'prisoner', 'Britain', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'moniker', 'prisoner', 'real', 'name', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'assumed', 'sort', 'stage', 'name', 'According', 'film', 'Peterson', 'desired', 'be', 'famous', 'went', 'garnering', 'fame', 'perpetuating', 'heinously', 'violent', 'actions', 'other', 'prisoners', 'prison', 'guards.The', 'film', 'bloody', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'incredibly', 'effective', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'powerhouse', 'role', 'sense', 'word', 'imposing', 'figure', 'start', 'powerfully', 'built', 'wrestler', 'physique', 'improbabilities', 'physical', 'altercations', 'believable', 'audience', 'attention', 'stranglehold', 'performance', 'playing', 'straight', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'turned', 'insane', 'human', 'cartoon', 'Instead', 'watch', 'credibly', 'complex', 'sociopathic', 'character', 'unfold', 'who', 'apparently', 'choosy', 'whom', 'will', 'wreck', 'carnage', 'primarily', 'heavily', 'armed', 'numerous', 'prison', 'guards', 'mirthless', 'laughter', 'beginning', 'film', 'audience', 'off-kilter', 'not', 'quite', 'able', 'regain', 'balance', 'time', 'end', 'roll', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'Hardy', 'Bronson', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'so', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'film', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'living', 'disaster.The', 'film', 'essentially', 'presented', 'Bronson', 'point', 'view', 'strange', 'storytelling', 'considering', 'sociopathic', 'bent', 'self-narrated', 'fantasy', 'asides', 'are', 'first', 'quite', 'bizarre', ""'re"", 'occurring', 'Bronson', 'telling', 'story', 'stage', 'full', 'makeup', 'heavy', 'dose', 'ofA', 'Clockwork', 'Orange-style', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'when', 'Bronson', 'committed', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'mental', 'institution', 'Again', 'could', 'be', 'interpreted', 'Bronson', 'views', 'situation', 'not', 'how', 'actually', 'were', 'also', 'odd', 'measure', 'homo-eroticism', 'film', 'Bronson', 'attract', 'attention', 'gay', 'men', 'albeit', 'never', 'semblance', 'romantic', 'reciprocation', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'one', 'fully', 'nude', 'shot', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'man-bits', 'including', 'scene', 'where', 'male', 'prison', 'librarian', 'give', 'full-body', 'butter', 'rubdown', 'make', 'more', 'difficult', 'handle', 'upcoming', 'fight.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'not', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'Bronson', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'little', 'off-putting', 'obvious', 'Refn', 'fascinated', 'Bronson', 'complexities', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Bronson', 'last', 'brutal', 'beating', 'hands', 'feet', 'batons', 'prison', 'guards', 'presented', 'exclusive', 'instigator', 'outpouring', 'violence', 'last', 'image', 'Bronson', 'bloodied', 'confined', 'solitary', 'cage', 'whimpering', 'wounded', 'animal', 'bound', 'stick', 'while.Bronson', 'brutal', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'walking', 'thin', 'line', 'dispassionately', 'violent', 'life', 'glorifying', 'perpetrator', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'then', 'again', 'how', 'else', 'would', 'portray', 'guy', 'who', 'wanted', 'get', 'famous', 'fashioning', 'persona', 'Britain', 'most', 'violent', 'prisoner']",N/A
1298677,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B002XTXFU8,Poor Napoleon,"[4, 6]","""Bronson"" opens with a brief narration from Charles Bronson, as played by Tom Hardy, stating how he always wanted to be famous.  Cut to a red lit scene where prison guards approach Bronson's cell, while Bronson is gearing up to fight the guards.  This all done to the tune of Scott Walker's ""The Electrician.""  This sets up the stylistic approach to ""Bronson,"" which is funny, alarming, disturbing, and at some points sad.The film is a biography of ""Britain's most notorious criminal.""  While Bronson is known for his wild antics, the director takes a very stylized approach in telling the story, including often ironic pairings of music and violence, ala A Clockwork Orange, Bronson speaking before an audience in clown makeup as he tells his story, and much a dose of very dark humor.  The approach makes this a fun film to watch.  As to how the viewer perceives Bronson, that's another story.In the film, Bronson is presented as a curious figure.  He's possibly insane and possibly sociopathic.  The script makes Bronson appear unapologetic, noting that his upbringing was decent enough, and stating how he loved prison.  The only time we get a chance to sympathize is possibly the original sentence, where Bronson stole about 40 dollars and went to jail initially for seven years.  He then states that the prison cell was like a hotel room for him.  He gets in numerous fights, is shuffled from prison to prison and hospital to hospital, where he remains today.  The film primarily focuses on the incidents that kept getting him in trouble.The film is anchored by the stylized approach and Tom Hardy's performance, which shifts between a subtle insane calmness, to a manic intensity.  Whether it's a straight performance of Bronson or not doesn't matter.  It fits the tone of the film and is funny and scary at the same time.  The film features a very carefully orchestrated soundtrack and unique cuts that keep the story interesting, which is a feat considering how much of Bronson's life was spent behind bars in solitary confinement.The film drags a bit toward the end, but it's altogether a fine film.  My one gripe is the intent of this film seems curious.  As a character, Bronson is fascinating to study.  However, it's easy to see how a viewer might feel the director is praising his exploits, or at the very least, take an obscene interest in this man as a celebrity.  He says he always wanted to be famous.

If your expecting HD quality buy the regular DVD, its the same quality as the blu-ray. I have both top of the lines Panny 1080p 50"" and a blu-ray player with HDMI connections. I have 50 blu-ray movies and about 400 standard DVD movies and this by far is one of the worst pictures I have ever seen. Please rent this one before you buy it and save your money. If your a movie buff like I am I hope this helped!",1,blu ray quality,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,797,"['Let', 'clear', 'air', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'movies', 'story', 'was', '5', '4', 'star', 'matter', 'made', 'mistake', 'not', 'waiting', 'more', 'reviewers', 'opinions', 'going', 'details', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'so', 'predictable', 'What', 'prompted', 'drop', 'review', 'one', 'star', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'going', 'buy', 'movie', 'please', 'rent', 'first', 'expecting', 'HD', 'quality', 'buy', 'regular', 'DVD', 'same', 'quality', 'blu-ray', 'have', 'top', 'lines', 'Panny', '1080p', '50', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'HDMI', 'connections', 'have', '50', 'blu-ray', 'movies', '400', 'standard', 'DVD', 'movies', 'far', 'one', 'worst', 'pictures', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Please', 'rent', 'one', 'buy', 'save', 'money', 'movie', 'buff', 'am', 'hope', 'helped']",N/A

1298691,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B002XTXFU8,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[6, 9]","Tom Hardy magnetizes the screen with his performance as ""Britain's Most Violent"" criminal, Charlie Bronson. ""Bronson"" is a semi-true tale about how a man born Michael Peterson decided he needed money to support his wife and new baby, so the 19 year old robbed a post office..and then began his first jail term. Michael discovers his real calling is violence as mantel to fame. Before long, he has a reputation as brawler, a kind of anarchist inmate done up as circus strongman. In the one period he actually gains freedom, Michael heads off to a whorehouse, hooks up with trannies and prostitutes then becomes a prize fighter who gets christened Charlie Bronson by his roguish hustler/manager.Soon after, Bronson commits a crime that sends him back, and he becomes the celebrity Charlie. Hardy burns with the violence of a psychotic carny; he spends parts of the movies telling Bronson's story onstage in stylized characters. The guards are terrified of him, yet he takes all comers with an almost celebratory glee until he is left bloodied and - once again - free to expand on his legend. hardy also took on an amazing training regiment for the movie, gaining almost 42 pounds in bulk by doing 2500 push-ups daily to not only get into physical form, but the mental one.""Bronson"" seethes with mentality. From the surrealistic asylum dance scene to the narrow cage Bronson is locked into at the film's end, the film applies its excessive violence without much rationale; Charlie acts violently because he just is. There are more than a few comparisons toA Clockwork Orangehere (especially in the cross cutting between Bronson's monologues and his history) but this movie, due mainly to Hardy's stunning performance, packs a wallop that few others in the true crime genre can match.",4,Bravura Brutality,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,1780,"['Tom', 'Hardy', 'screen', 'performance', 'Britain', 'Most', 'Violent', 'criminal', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'Bronson', 'semi-true', 'tale', 'how', 'man', 'born', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'decided', 'needed', 'money', 'support', 'wife', 'new', 'baby', '19', 'year', 'old', 'robbed', 'post', 'office..and', 'then', 'began', 'first', 'jail', 'term', 'Michael', 'real', 'calling', 'violence', 'mantel', 'fame', 'long', 'reputation', 'brawler', 'kind', 'anarchist', 'inmate', 'done', 'up', 'circus', 'strongman', 'one', 'period', 'actually', 'gains', 'freedom', 'Michael', 'off', 'whorehouse', 'up', 'trannies', 'prostitutes', 'then', 'prize', 'fighter', 'who', 'christened', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'roguish', 'hustler/manager.Soon', 'Bronson', 'crime', 'back', 'celebrity', 'Charlie', 'Hardy', 'violence', 'psychotic', 'carny', 'parts', 'movies', 'telling', 'Bronson', 'story', 'onstage', 'stylized', 'characters', 'guards', 'are', 'terrified', 'yet', 'comers', 'almost', 'celebratory', 'glee', 'left', 'bloodied', 'once', 'again', 'free', 'expand', 'legend', 'hardy', 'also', 'took', 'amazing', 'training', 'regiment', 'movie', 'gaining', 'almost', '42', 'pounds', 'bulk', 'doing', '2500', 'push-ups', 'daily', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'physical', 'form', 'mental', 'one', 'Bronson', 'seethes', 'mentality', 'surrealistic', 'asylum', 'dance', 'scene', 'narrow', 'cage', 'Bronson', 'locked', 'film', 'end', 'film', 'excessive', 'violence', 'much', 'rationale', 'Charlie', 'violently', 'just', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'comparisons', 'toA', 'Clockwork', 'Orangehere', 'especially', 'cross', 'cutting', 'Bronson', 'monologues', 'history', 'movie', 'due', 'mainly', 'Hardy', 'stunning', 'performance', 'wallop', 'few', 'others', 'true', 'crime', 'genre', 'can', 'match']",N/A
