It does not bother me that the new series is not even as faithful as the first series (and that one was only partially faithful)although that is what it was originally supposed to be (according to advance press releases). What bothers me is that the producers took a great story (the original manga!) and dumbed it down to a child's level. I would let a 6 to 12-year-old kid watch this, but I honestly would not recommend it for an adult, unless you like light comedy, and only virginal interaction between the characters.

It does violate a lot of the basics set up in the first series and (worse to my mind) changes some of the personalities of the characters to some degree, lesser or greater.

1198625,A33X5YSRG6YRQI,B001GT9DR0,Cory LaFerriere,"[13, 17]","First of all, I love the Negima manga series.  The U.S. release is now up to volume 20 and it has been a fantastic ride the whole way through.  The first anime series was ok.  For the most part it followed the stories laid out in the first few volumes of the manga pretty accurately.  Then for the final few episodes they created original material to wrap up the series.  Overall, it was fun to see a great manga series in animated form with voices and music, but they really only scratched the surface.This second Negima anime series starts over and pretty much tells its own story.  Some might complain because they want to see the Manga better represented, but I see no need for this.  I can enjoy the anime series as an alternate storyline, and this one is just all around fun.  The animation is fantastic and the characters are well represented.  Since it's a new story I get the same sense of wondering what will happen next that I do when reading the manga.One bit of advice.  Going into this series it would help to be familiar either with the manga or the first anime, because this series spends a lot less time explaining things.  I would probably be confused if I had just jumped into this series without my previous knowledge of the Negima universe.  The creators really seem to assume the viewer already knows thw who's and the what's of it all.  So it's not truly a sequel because it starts over, but it's not completely independent from previous versions either.I look forward to the next DVD release continuing this series, as well as the hopeful eventual release of the live action Negima series.",5,"When they say re-imagined, they mean it.

1198626,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001GT9DR0,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[21, 25]","Technically, there's already been an anime series -- ""Negima"" -- about preteen wizard/schoolteacher Negi Springfield.But apparently that isn't stopping them from creating another parallel series, rebooting and revamping Ken Akamatsu's bestselling manga into the visually lush, fantastical ""Negima!?"" (see, the question and exclaimation mark mean it's a different show!). And this series is a vastly different creation -- while it's rarely faithful to the original manga's storylines, it's still a solid fantasy story sprinkled with some fun comic relief. And chupacabras.Negi has been assigned to a vast all-girls Mahora Academy in Japan -- but things start going wrong before he even starts. Half-asleep student Asuna witnesses a small magical display, and a vampire is attacking students. A vampire who is also his student.Even worse, the vampire Evangeline and her robotic partner Chachamaru are targeting Negi, since the boy is her only ticket out of a curse that binds her to Mahora. Even worse, her suppressed superpowers come back at the full moon -- and soon Negi's only hope of defeating Evangeline is by forming a Pactio (a magical contract). Asuna is the logical choice since she already knows about his magic, but will the stubborn girl agree before Evangeline's icy magic smashes Mahora?But there's more trouble when a pair of disguised wizards bring news -- the legendary Star Crystal has been stolen, and it may be related to odd happenings at Mahora. As Negi tries to avoid erminehood, he must deal with a kindly resident ghost, the dangerous Library Island, camping trips with his Pactio partners, and an evil fairy that is attacking the school -- and even transports them to another dimension. Can Negi keep his class safe from whatever has stolen the Star Crystal -- and avoid being turned into an animal?For the record, ""Negima!?"" isn't very faithful to Ken Akamatsu's original manga -- the first few episodes loosely follow one of his storylines, before spinning off in a totally different direction with the whole Star Crystal storyline. And rather than use the comedy and romantic woes, the first thirteen episodes choose to focus on all the magic that can be crammed into thirteen episodes -- transformations, spells, enslavement, vampires, aerial battles and chupacabras. Well, sort of.Fortunately ""Negima!?"" never feels overstuffed, even though there's plenty going on here on many levels (personal, magical, and Pactiowise). The various subplots mesh together very smoothly right up to the cliffhanger, and the writers patch in stretches of quiet time where the characters talk, plot and occasionally go to class. And of course, we get some  spectacular magical battles and creepy magical creatures, with one highlight being the flashback of Negi's father battling Evangeline in a ruined city.And though the focus is on magic and action, there's still plenty of comic relief -- chupacabra clubs, meatball-shapoed spies, goofy Pactio transformations, and a hilarious scene where Negi tries fruitlessly to erase Asuna's memory. His life becomes entertainingly chaotic as more and more girls learn of his magic powers, and he's forced to make more and more Pactios.Even if ""Negima!?"" had a really rotten storyline, it would be worth watching for the simply stunning animation. The entire series is soaked in dark jewel tones and swirling magical spells, with erupting jungles of ice and hedgey mazes where evil creatures lurk. Mahora is a shadowy, vaguely gothic place with lots of dim streets and a city filled with starlike lights. And the level of detail can be breathtaking -- while casting one elaborate spell, Asuna can be seen clearly reflected in Negi's glasses.Negi proves to be a likable little hero -- earnest, courageous, unselfish and a bit tightly wound, while Asuna proves to be stubborn, brash, eccentric and almost superhumanly strong. And though there's a vast cast, they all get a measure of fleshing out -- Konoka and her hard-nosed bodyguard Setsuna, serene ninja Kaede, bookish Nodoka, and even a ghostly student who's still hanging around. The best is undoubtedly Evangeline -- especially since the writers pause to reveal what a tragic, lonely life she has.""Negima!?"" is a stunningly animated revamp Negi Springfield's adventures -- and while not terribly faithful to the manga, these dark-edged magical adventures are definitely worth watching.",4,Aaaaaaand take two!,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,4393,"['Technically', 'already', 'been', 'anime', 'series', 'Negima', 'preteen', 'wizard/schoolteacher', 'Negi', 'Springfield.But', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'stopping', 'creating', 'parallel', 'series', 'rebooting', 'revamping', 'Ken', 'Akamatsu', 'bestselling', 'manga', 'visually', 'lush', 'fantastical', 'Negima', 'see', 'question', 'exclaimation', 'mark', 'mean', 'different', 'show', 'series', 'vastly', 'different', 'creation', 'rarely', 'faithful', 'original', 'manga', 'storylines', 'still', 'solid', 'fantasy', 'story', 'sprinkled', 'fun', 'comic', 'relief', 'chupacabras.Negi', 'been', 'assigned', 'vast', 'all-girls', 'Mahora', 'Academy', 'Japan', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'wrong', 'even', 'Half-asleep', 'student', 'Asuna', 'small', 'magical', 'display', 'vampire', 'attacking', 'students', 'A', 'vampire', 'who', 'also', 'student.Even', 'worse', 'vampire', 'Evangeline', 'robotic', 'partner', 'Chachamaru', 'are', 'targeting', 'Negi', 'boy', 'only', 'ticket', 'curse', 'Mahora', 'Even', 'worse', 'suppressed', 'superpowers', 'come', 'back', 'full', 'moon', 'soon', 'Negi', 'only', 'hope', 'defeating', 'Evangeline', 'forming', 'Pactio', 'magical', 'contract', 'Asuna', 'logical', 'choice', 'already', 'magic', 'will', 'stubborn', 'girl', 'agree', 'Evangeline', 'icy', 'magic', 'smashes', 'Mahora', 'more', 'trouble', 'when', 'pair', 'disguised', 'wizards', 'bring', 'news', 'legendary', 'Star', 'Crystal', 'been', 'stolen', 'may', 'be', 'related', 'odd', 'happenings', 'Mahora', 'Negi', 'avoid', 'erminehood', 'must', 'deal', 'kindly', 'resident', 'ghost', 'dangerous', 'Library', 'Island', 'camping', 'trips', 'Pactio', 'partners', 'evil', 'fairy', 'attacking', 'school', 'even', 'dimension', 'Can', 'Negi', 'keep', 'class', 'safe', 'stolen', 'Star', 'Crystal', 'avoid', 'being', 'turned', 'animal', 'record', 'Negima', ""n't"", 'very', 'faithful', 'Ken', 'Akamatsu', 'original', 'manga', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'loosely', 'follow', 'one', 'storylines', 'spinning', 'off', 'totally', 'different', 'direction', 'whole', 'Star', 'Crystal', 'storyline', 'rather', 'use', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'woes', 'first', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'choose', 'focus', 'magic', 'can', 'be', 'crammed', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'transformations', 'spells', 'enslavement', 'vampires', 'aerial', 'battles', 'chupacabras', 'Well', 'sort', 'of.Fortunately', 'Negima', 'never', 'overstuffed', 'even', 'plenty', 'going', 'here', 'many', 'levels', 'personal', 'magical', 'Pactiowise', 'various', 'subplots', 'mesh', 'together', 'very', 'smoothly', 'right', 'up', 'cliffhanger', 'writers', 'patch', 'stretches', 'quiet', 'time', 'where', 'characters', 'talk', 'plot', 'occasionally', 'go', 'class', 'course', 'get', 'spectacular', 'magical', 'battles', 'creepy', 'magical', 'creatures', 'one', 'highlight', 'being', 'flashback', 'Negi', 'father', 'battling', 'Evangeline', 'ruined', 'city.And', 'focus', 'magic', 'action', 'still', 'plenty', 'comic', 'relief', 'chupacabra', 'clubs', 'meatball-shapoed', 'spies', 'goofy', 'Pactio', 'transformations', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'where', 'Negi', 'fruitlessly', 'erase', 'Asuna', 'memory', 'life', 'entertainingly', 'chaotic', 'more', 'more', 'girls', 'learn', 'magic', 'powers', 'forced', 'make', 'more', 'more', 'Pactios.Even', 'Negima', 'had', 'really', 'rotten', 'storyline', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'simply', 'stunning', 'animation', 'entire', 'series', 'soaked', 'dark', 'jewel', 'tones', 'swirling', 'magical', 'spells', 'erupting', 'jungles', 'ice', 'hedgey', 'mazes', 'where', 'evil', 'lurk', 'Mahora', 'shadowy', 'vaguely', 'gothic', 'place', 'lots', 'dim', 'streets', 'city', 'filled', 'starlike', 'lights', 'level', 'detail', 'can', 'be', 'breathtaking', 'casting', 'one', 'elaborate', 'spell', 'Asuna', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'clearly', 'reflected', 'Negi', 'glasses.Negi', 'be', 'likable', 'little', 'hero', 'earnest', 'courageous', 'unselfish', 'bit', 'tightly', 'wound', 'Asuna', 'be', 'stubborn', 'brash', 'eccentric', 'almost', 'superhumanly', 'strong', 'vast', 'cast', 'get', 'measure', 'fleshing', 'out', 'Konoka', 'hard-nosed', 'bodyguard', 'Setsuna', 'serene', 'ninja', 'Kaede', 'bookish', 'Nodoka', 'even', 'ghostly', 'student', 'who', 'still', 'hanging', 'around', 'best', 'undoubtedly', 'Evangeline', 'especially', 'writers', 'pause', 'reveal', 'what', 'tragic', 'lonely', 'life', 'has.', 'Negima', 'stunningly', 'animated', 'revamp', 'Negi', 'Springfield', 'adventures', 'not', 'terribly', 'faithful', 'manga', 'dark-edged', 'magical', 'adventures', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']","Negima!?: Season 2, Part One Re-imagined and Uncut"
1198627,A30YX90TG1USSR,B001GT9DR0,G. P. Hawkins,"[0, 0]","After reading the rather lurid plot synopsis on Amazon, I nearly passed up this video, but the presence in it of several of my favorite voice-actresses got me to give it a try, and now I'm glad I did.Firstly, ignore all the talk about &#34;temptation,&#34; in the synopsis; the series is quite wholesome. Beyond a couple of schoolgirl crushes, there is no sexual content in the video at all. It is a magical adventure series, and it does that very well indeed.Only one thing kept me from giving this series the five stars it would otherwise have earned, the presence of my least favorite thing in anime, the comic pages, or anywhere else: talking animals. Aside from the ferret who seems to be channeling Joan Rivers, there is a frog and a cat, though the only way to tell with the latter two is that they say so. These animals add nothing to the show, and could easily have been omitted.Now for the good stuff. Somehow the writers managed to give each of the 31 students her own personality, something some script-writers can't manage with even four or fives characters. Character development happens mainly with the ten or twelve main students, but even this is a monumental achievement. The story itself, moves right along with elements of mystery and intrigue, and the end of each episode had me impatiently scene-skipping to the start of the next.

Neel ""Jemcollector""","[1, 2]","I usually wait until after I've watched a series a couple of times before attempting to review it, but since that's not likely to happen - at least not anytime soon! - here goes.First, let me say I AM a fan of: Ken Akamatsu's manga and anime Love Hina ( including the disliked Love Hina - Again anime ); 3/4 of the previous version of Negima!; and most of Moon Phase.  So I had great hopes for THIS - but once again, I find I was mistaken.  Having read some of the manga this is based on, I'd hoped this series would correct the problem I thought the first version suffered from, divergence from the ""original"" storyline.  Instead, Negima!? ( the ? part of the title is well-deserved because you'll be wondering just how any of this could possibly be related to the original Negima! ) almost completely abandons the original story, going off on unending random tangents that do nothing whatsoever to advance any over-arching plot or character development.  Indeed, as with the equally disappointing latest version of Tenchi Muyo!, most of the previously-well established and liked characters ( Asuna, Nodoka, Eva, and others ) are either ignored or suffer considerable personality changes.  ( And to parody Motsu's favorite expression, I DON'T mean that in a GOOD way! )As all-too-often with anime series based on currently-running manga, there is literally no end in sight, forcing the anime writers to improvise.  With the original series it meant inventing a story arc involving an unlikely ""death"" for one of the main characters, followed by an anticlimactic final episode.  Here, there are repeated crises, climaxes, regressions, reversions, conversions, etc. ad nauseum resulting in a ""who cares"" attitude towards the characters, the setting, and entire storyline.  It doesn't even bother to give any but the barest ""backstory"", and that in the first 3 episodes, assuming viewers are already familliar with characters, situation, and plot from the previous versions.  From that too-little effort it then diverges into its own ""universe"", never to return.  The ONLY saving grace ( though actually a BIG part of the problem ) is the beautiful and clever animation from the same studio and director that gave us Pani Poni Dash and Moon Phase. I thought the original Negima! bore too close a resemblance to Love Hina; the sound and look of Negima!? is totally different, befitting what is in all-but-name a totally different production.  Unfortunately it may be viewed as something of a victory of ""style over substance"", of which there is virtually none.

He ends up being middle school homeroom/english teacher. One of his students, Asuna discovers his secret. If a person discovers his secret magic powers, Negi must make a contract with them by kissing them. This also gives the partner magic powers. Not to long after that he has a run-in with his father's old enemy. With Asuna and a few other girls at his side, Negi can better fight the enemy. Before that happens, pretty much all the girls in his class know the secret of Negi's magic. If he wants to avoid having his magic taken and turned into an animal, he must make a contract with all the girls in his class. Life keep getting more and more complicated for him.This is a very off the wall series. It combines action, comedy, fantasy, harem, and drama. It's pretty stacked. There was a previous series called Negima. I haven't seen it, but I understand that this is a crazier retelling. You can tell the difference by the ""!?"" after the title. The newer version has the ""!?"" after it. This series is extremely silly. It reminds me a lot of PaniPoni Dash. If you have seen that series, you can expect a similar scenario. The main difference is that we have a boy teacher instead of a girl, and there is a magical world theme as well. The animation in this series is very well done, so is the soundtrack and the voice acting. There are a lot of very cool characters too. This anime has a lot going for it. The only thing they could have improved on is the plot. I think the story gives way to off the wall comedy and silliness most of the time. That's not a bad thing though. This series is still quite good and a lot of fun. I think just about any anime fan can find something to like about Negima!?

The series does give you a retelling somewhat of the arrival of ten year old wizard in training Negi Springfield to the all girl school to take over a class and the rest of the characters are in the series most of their personalities for the most part are changed somewhat,  and while I grew to greatly enjoy the situations and shenanigans the girl students would get into in the Negima! series sadly I just couldn't care less for them in this season re-make.  The animation also was a headache for me turning from an almost dramatic look to a seemingly childish cartoonish scenes and while that can look good on some series here it just looked awful.  The series also tries to tone it down with the more dramatic storyline the first season had near its last few episodes and keep it more light-hearted and humorous but it just seemed to fall flat where you couldn't even bother watching a whole episode through to the end which is somewhat sad considering the great voice cast you had for the English and Japanese actors and actresses for the series season.
