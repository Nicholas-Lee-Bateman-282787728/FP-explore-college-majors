It's really bad, but so over the top bad that it's pretty amusing which is why I gave it three stars. You'd have to enjoy costume dramas to find it funny; if you don't like them, you'll hate this all the more. If this was all unknown actors it probably wouldn't be nearly as laugh inducing. Diana Rigg charging around caverns in period dress is great. Bonham Carter absolutely does the best possible with this role and she and the hero are mercifully given little dialogue- in this movie it helps no end to not have to actually say anything. The other actors are not so lucky, but all seem to be having a pretty good time hamming it up. You can almost see them doubling over with laughter as soon as the director yells cut. They probably had a ball filming this as no one could possibly take it seriously.",3,So bad it's kind of good,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,866,"['just', 'watched', 'Hazards', 'tube', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'really', 'bad', 'so', 'top', 'bad', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'why', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', ""'d"", 'have', 'enjoy', 'costume', 'dramas', 'find', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'more', 'was', 'unknown', 'actors', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'laugh', 'inducing', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'charging', 'around', 'caverns', 'period', 'dress', 'great', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'absolutely', 'best', 'possible', 'role', 'hero', 'are', 'mercifully', 'given', 'little', 'dialogue-', 'movie', 'end', 'not', 'have', 'actually', 'say', 'anything', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', 'hamming', 'up', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'doubling', 'laughter', 'as', 'soon', 'director', 'cut', 'probably', 'had', 'ball', 'filming', 'one', 'could', 'possibly', 'take', 'seriously']",A Hazard of Hearts / Lady Hamilton

923840,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,B000A8AXXG,CodeMaster Talon,"[24, 25]","I saw this movie approximately 1000 times as a child. That's not hyperbole. ""A Hazard of Hearts"" is my Mom's favorite movie and when I was a child we watched it nearly every day. I'm watching it right now, and I'm not remotely bored. We sit around and recite huge patches of the dialogue, laughing at the silliness and sighing over the romance.Written by Barbara Cartland but differing strongly from the novel, ""A Hazard of Hearts"" charts the misadventures of spunky, intelligent Miss Staverly, played with radiant adorableness by a very young Helena Bonham Carter. As we open our story Miss Staverly's Papa is busy gambling away her home and her hand in marriage (her maid Eudora senses ""something wrong""). Only a throw of the dice saves her from marriage to the dastardly Lord Rutum (Mr. Fox, in one of the most loathsome villainous turns I can think of), but out of the frying pan into the fire--she finds herself won by the forbidding yet handsome, mysterious yet romantic Lord Vulcan (what a name), and he dispatches her off to his magnificent yet creepy mansion (Secret passageways! Underground tunnels! A hidden casino! An ever-growing stockpile of bodies in their own personal cave!) to be watched over by his not entirely sane and definitely ruthless Mother, played by Diana Rigg, in the performance of her career (Favorite Lady Vulcan scene: stabbing a smuggler while sporting an enormous pink satin bow on her head. Even by Rigg's standards, a watershed moment.).This film is chock full of character actors and screen legends (Stewart Granger! Christopher Plummer!), the costumes are elegant and ever so slightly wacky (I love the loopy, mud-splattered hat Serena sports on her frantic ride to Justin's side), and the plot at once clich&eacute;d ridden and utterly original. Few scripts have such an abundance of quotable lines: ""Shall I make you fall in love with me, Serena?"" ""I am familiar with Lord Rutum. Among other things, he murdered my father."" ""Ten thousand guineas. That's your price for selling one of my guests out of my house--to a lecher."" (True Anecdote: My Mom and my sister were shoe shopping, and in the dressing room started to argue over pair of shoes my sister wanted. My Mom began to recite Lord Vulcan's speech to his mother: ""It's not enough for you, is it? Still, it's not enough. You want more, more, more! You're INSANE with greed!"" Brought their fellow shoppers to a gaping standstill.)From the elegant sitting rooms of Staverly Place to the twisted corridors of Mandrake (""Mandrake may be your mistress, but it is not my master!""), from precariously riding side-saddle on Thunder Bolt (""Your epic ride to my rescue is already being proclaimed in every club in London"") to hitching a ride with resident Highwayman The Joker (""I don't steal from pretty young ladies""), this gem is sure to give you many a rainy night's blissful entertainment. An absolute must for fans of goof-tastic cinema, and a beloved childhood favorite, rating:GRADE: A+(Note: ""Lady Hamilton"", the other film on this low-end, bare-bones DVD, is not reviewed here, because other Amazon reviewers lived through that pain for us.

It's entertaining good to watch if you are interested in the actors -Lady Hamilton is a great film in the sense that it portrays the condition of lower class women in England in the early 19th Century extremely well.  I have used it to show my students the appalling situations that women found themselves in simply because they were women and had no protection from their society.I used to pass by the inn where Emma Hamilton and Admiral Nelson used to meet at Box Hill in England very often and even had breakfast there once.  Watching the film gave me a full picture of what Lady Hamilton's life was really like.The performances are really very touching and powerful.  It's a film that makes you think and feel glad that you were born after female emancipation!

The only thing that works slightly against her is the fact that she doesn't really look her age at the time (21).  There are moments in the film, where I would have guessed her to be in her mid-teens.  Given the actor paired with her does look his age (29), they seem a bit mismatched..it would have been smart to have paired her with a younger looking male lead...I think if they had done that, the word ""jailbait"" might not have popped up in my mind when I saw them embrace).Also, I thought the score was a bit overdone, but that might have been intentional.But ""A Hazard of Hearts"" is good fun nonetheless.",4,Nice Movie at the Beginning of Bonham Carter's Career,1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,1798,"['review', 'A', 'Hazard', 'Hearts', 'only', 'other', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'got', 'Netflix', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'spunk', 'spirit', 'class', 'sex', 'appeal', 'one', 'fiery', 'little', 'package', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'lucky', 'man', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', 'Hazard', 'Hearts', 'classic', 'Gothic', 'romance', 'sort', 'story', ""'d"", 'see', 'bookstore', 'next', 'Harlequin', 'romances', 'featuring', 'young', 'heroine', 'grounds', 'gloomy', 'castle', 'being', 'watched', 'balcony', 'handsome', 'brooding', 'Darcy-esque', 'young', 'man.Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Serena', 'daughter', 'nobleman', 'who', 'suicide', 'losing', 'reckless', 'wager', 'lecherous', 'peer', 'played', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'virtue', 'saved', 'Justin', 'mysterious', 'handsome', 'young', 'peer', 'indifference', 'Serena', 'Will', 'Justin', 'Serena', 'fall', 'love', 'Will', 'evil', 'peer', 'triumph', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'Hazard', 'Hearts', 'hardly', 'unpredictable', 'movie', 'quite', 'fun', 'watch', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'production', 'quite', 'high.As', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'performance', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'indicator', 'even', 'better', 'work', 'lying', 'ahead', 'only', 'thing', 'slightly', 'fact', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'age', 'time', '21', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'be', 'mid-teens', 'Given', 'actor', 'paired', 'look', 'age', '29', 'seem', 'bit', 'mismatched..it', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'smart', 'have', 'paired', 'younger', 'looking', 'male', 'lead', 'think', 'had', 'done', 'word', 'jailbait', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'popped', 'up', 'mind', 'when', 'saw', 'embrace', '.Also', 'thought', 'score', 'was', 'bit', 'overdone', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'intentional.But', 'A', 'Hazard', 'Hearts', 'good', 'fun', 'nonetheless']",A Hazard of Hearts / Lady Hamilton
