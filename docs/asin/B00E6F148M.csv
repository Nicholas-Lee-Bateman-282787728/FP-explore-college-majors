1664985,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00E6F148M,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","{2.5 stars}Pretty standard Asylum fare--for a certain taste and mood. Formulaic storyline that's a big rip-off of DISCONNECT and other films about cyber-bullying, flat acting and characterization, stupid script, and a run-of-the-mill clich&eacute;d portrait of adolescence and high school. The single worst thing about MOTHER, however, is that the cover and title completely destroy what could have been a nice element of surprise.On a brighter note, there's something about this film that makes it fun to watch if you're in the mood for something mindless and cheesy. Like most Asylum pix, it's effectively unintentionally funny. MOTHER views a bit like a parody of a Lifetime film. Intense, violent, and profane, but no graphic gore or sex/nudity.",3,"""My mother's attacking my best friend--Please hurry!""",1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,749,"['2.5', 'stars', 'Pretty', 'standard', 'Asylum', 'fare', 'certain', 'taste', 'mood', 'Formulaic', 'storyline', 'big', 'rip-off', 'DISCONNECT', 'other', 'films', 'cyber-bullying', 'flat', 'acting', 'characterization', 'stupid', 'script', 'run-of-the-mill', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'portrait', 'adolescence', 'high', 'school', 'single', 'worst', 'thing', 'MOTHER', 'however', 'cover', 'title', 'completely', 'destroy', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'element', 'surprise.On', 'brighter', 'note', 'something', 'film', 'watch', ""'re"", 'mood', 'something', 'mindless', 'cheesy', 'most', 'Asylum', 'pix', 'effectively', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'MOTHER', 'bit', 'parody', 'Lifetime', 'film', 'Intense', 'violent', 'profane', 'graphic', 'gore', 'sex/nudity']",Mother
1664986,A387BD735MI50R,B00E6F148M,R. Schultz,"[5, 6]","At first I thought this movie might have an exclusively insider focus on teen culture and might therefore fall somewhat outside my ken. But I soon became absorbed in the action despite those years being behind me. These teens have a wider variety of interesting personalities than the average teen movie. They have significant interactions with the adult community. What&#8217;s more, they&#8217;re given more of a range of emotion than mere teen petulance over having been forced to buy a non-designer handbag. The lead character faces what has become a critical social problem - having her social networking page hacked.The popular lead girl of the story, just recently voted President of her class, suddenly finds herself ostracized and preyed upon because of some confidences she presumably betrays and some undermining assessments she presumably posts on her page. Most of her classmates don&#8217;t believe her protestations that she did NOT post those remarks. But who could have a motive to so viciously turn her from school poster girl to pariah?At the start of the movie, we are offered a few likely suspects. But some pointed early clues offered up and the format of the DVD itself place one suspect clearly at the forefront of the pack from the start. This movie doesn&#8217;t depend solely on the &#8220;Whodunit&#8221; factor though. Its portrayal of the way in which the girl&#8217;s classmates so readily turn against her, and the insidious ways in which computer hacking can wreak havoc on a life, are interesting features in their own right. There&#8217;s a compelling realism to the girl&#8217;s dilemma that held my interest and informed me from the moment I logged onto this DVD.",4,Held My Interest,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,1700,"['first', 'thought', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'exclusively', 'insider', 'focus', 'teen', 'culture', 'might', 'therefore', 'fall', 'somewhat', 'outside', 'ken', 'soon', 'became', 'absorbed', 'action', 'years', 'being', 'teens', 'have', 'wider', 'variety', 'interesting', 'personalities', 'average', 'teen', 'movie', 'have', 'significant', 'interactions', 'adult', 'community', 'What', '8217', 'more', '8217', 're', 'given', 'more', 'range', 'emotion', 'mere', 'teen', 'petulance', 'having', 'been', 'forced', 'buy', 'non-designer', 'handbag', 'lead', 'character', 'what', 'become', 'critical', 'social', 'problem', 'having', 'social', 'networking', 'page', 'hacked.The', 'popular', 'lead', 'girl', 'story', 'just', 'recently', 'voted', 'President', 'class', 'suddenly', 'ostracized', 'preyed', 'confidences', 'presumably', 'betrays', 'undermining', 'assessments', 'presumably', 'page', 'Most', 'classmates', 'don', '8217', 'believe', 'protestations', 'did', 'NOT', 'post', 'remarks', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'motive', 'so', 'viciously', 'turn', 'school', 'poster', 'girl', 'pariah', 'start', 'movie', 'are', 'offered', 'few', 'likely', 'suspects', 'pointed', 'early', 'clues', 'offered', 'up', 'format', 'DVD', 'place', 'one', 'suspect', 'clearly', 'forefront', 'pack', 'start', 'movie', 'doesn', '8217', 'depend', 'solely', '8220', 'Whodunit', '8221', 'factor', 'portrayal', 'way', 'girl', '8217', 'classmates', 'readily', 'turn', 'insidious', 'ways', 'computer', 'hacking', 'can', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'life', 'are', 'interesting', 'features', 'own', 'right', '8217', 's', 'compelling', 'realism', 'girl', '8217', 'dilemma', 'held', 'interest', 'informed', 'moment', 'logged', 'DVD']",Mother
