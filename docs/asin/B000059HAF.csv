572923,A33L7G4E8CID3,B000059HAF,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[5, 7]","Steve McQueen stars in this very intense drama about imperialism and the lingering effects of &quot;manifest destiny.&quot; This is a first-rate Vietnam allegory, and it centers on Machinist's Mate Jake Holman. He is transferred to the U.S.S. San Pablo, a gunboat stationed on the Yangtze River. It is clear from the beginning that the crew is lazy: they have Chinese &quot;cooleys&quot; to do all the manual labor for them, while the officers hang around. Holman is from the old school, get-your-hands-dirty school of thought. They clash, and soon he has the entire crew on edge as he threatens the balance on board the ship. &quot;Nobody has ever died on the San Pablo&quot; says the stoic captain. Indeed, nothing much ever happens. Every night the guys go to a seedy nightclub, every day they spray down the local protesters. Soon, though, these mean shows turn into resentment in the hearts of the Chinese. Hatred, coming from the Bolsheviks up north and discontentment in China, brings protesters to the San Pablo demanding its departure. Instead of leaving, the San Pablo stays to protect missionaries that neither need nor want protecting. Soon the captain's steadfastness tears the ship apart, nearly to mutiny. The missionaries declare themselves &quot;stateless people&quot; and want no help from the Navy men, but the captain thinks that the time for such fine distinctions is past. Nominated for Best Picture, this is a film that stands the test of time very well, like most of McQueen's films do. A Vietnam allegory and an anti-Imperialism message make this an endearing work, but it is a timeless film and incredibly deep.",5,"Deep, Fascinating Imperialism Commentary",999561600,"09 4, 2001",2001,1637,"['Steve', 'McQueen', 'very', 'intense', 'drama', 'imperialism', 'lingering', 'effects', 'quot', 'manifest', 'destiny.', 'quot', 'first-rate', 'Vietnam', 'allegory', 'Machinist', 'Mate', 'Jake', 'Holman', 'transferred', 'U.S.S', 'San', 'Pablo', 'gunboat', 'stationed', 'Yangtze', 'River', 'clear', 'beginning', 'crew', 'lazy', 'have', 'Chinese', 'quot', 'cooleys', 'quot', 'do', 'manual', 'labor', 'officers', 'hang', 'around', 'Holman', 'old', 'school', 'get-your-hands-dirty', 'school', 'thought', 'clash', 'soon', 'entire', 'crew', 'edge', 'balance', 'board', 'ship', 'quot', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'died', 'San', 'Pablo', 'quot', 'stoic', 'captain', 'Indeed', 'nothing', 'much', 'ever', 'night', 'guys', 'go', 'seedy', 'nightclub', 'day', 'spray', 'down', 'local', 'protesters', 'Soon', 'though', 'mean', 'turn', 'resentment', 'hearts', 'Chinese', 'Hatred', 'coming', 'Bolsheviks', 'up', 'north', 'discontentment', 'China', 'protesters', 'San', 'Pablo', 'demanding', 'departure', 'Instead', 'leaving', 'San', 'Pablo', 'protect', 'missionaries', 'need', 'want', 'protecting', 'Soon', 'captain', 'steadfastness', 'ship', 'apart', 'nearly', 'mutiny', 'missionaries', 'declare', 'quot', 'stateless', 'people', 'quot', 'want', 'help', 'Navy', 'men', 'captain', 'time', 'such', 'fine', 'distinctions', 'past', 'Nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'film', 'test', 'time', 'very', 'well', 'most', 'McQueen', 'films', 'do', 'A', 'Vietnam', 'allegory', 'anti-Imperialism', 'message', 'make', 'endearing', 'work', 'timeless', 'film', 'incredibly', 'deep']",N/A

I loved The Sand Pebbles because it is a great movie and an excellent adaptation of the novel. A story of a simple sailor (McQueen) whose existence was limited to taking good care of his ship's engine and staying out of life's way... at first.  But life became very complicated as Jake interacted with his shipmates, the young Chinese man Jake taught to run the engine and the beautiful, naive missionary (Candice Bergen)who was able to relate to qualities in him that Jake had given up on long ago. And history got in everyone's way. This story takes place against the backdrop of a very turbulant time in China's history.

It was nominated for 8 Academy Awards in 1966 including Best Picture, Best Actor (Steve McQueen), Best Supporting Actor (Mako), Music and on and on.I believe this was McQueen's greatest performance and that says a lot.  I have always thought that he was a very underrated actor, not just a macho pretty face.  His films, such as Bullitt, the Cincinnati Kid, the Getaway, Tom Horn, the Reivers and Junior Bonner showed his great range from serious drama to comedy.Even though it was Mako who received the Supporting Oscar nod (and really is terrific) I truely believe that it was Richard Crenna who should have not only been nominated but won.  Crenna is superb.  He has always been a great actor and the Sand Pebbles shows it.  The entire supporting cast is great.  Richard Attenborough (his best film I think), Candace Bergen and even Simon Oakland give the best performances of their careers.

In other words, every GI that suffered a Far East tour can find something in this movie they will recognize.The Sand Pebbles is a movie which details the struggles of the men on a Yangtze River gunboat-the USS San Pablo.  The men are Regular Navy, tough men with little education or chance in the Civilian World of 1920's America.One of these tough men is Holman (Steve McQueen), he is sent to the Yangtze Patrol from the battleship fleet and must come to grips with the absurd situation aboard the San Pablo.  The absurdity:  Chinamen do all the tasks that the sailors normally do.  This includes cooking, painting, and most importantly engine maintenance.  The Chinese labor leaves the sailors little to do but stand watch, conduct battle drills, look pretty, and get on each other's nerves.The story cross-cuts the ethical and political dilemmas of American military involvement in the Far East.  It's in the details that the story lays bare the situation, in the Chinese labor-often incompetent-on the gunboat, in American political aims in a nation beset with civil war and warlordism, and in the difficulty of leadership in such a situation.  It's portrayal of the morality of Sinic Civilization (China, Korea, Vietnam) is wholly accurate.This movie's highlight is staring actor Steve McQueen, quite possibly the coolest American actor ever.",5,Any American GI That Did A Tour In The Far East Will Recognize Something Therein,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1463,"['GI', 'served', 'Korea', 'Far', 'East', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'say', 'Yes', 'what', 'was', 'like', 'other', 'words', 'GI', 'suffered', 'Far', 'East', 'tour', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'movie', 'will', 'recognize.The', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'movie', 'details', 'struggles', 'men', 'Yangtze', 'River', 'gunboat-the', 'USS', 'San', 'Pablo', 'men', 'are', 'Regular', 'Navy', 'tough', 'men', 'little', 'education', 'chance', 'Civilian', 'World', '1920', 'America.One', 'tough', 'men', 'Holman', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'sent', 'Yangtze', 'Patrol', 'battleship', 'fleet', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'absurd', 'situation', 'San', 'Pablo', 'absurdity', 'Chinamen', 'do', 'tasks', 'sailors', 'normally', 'do', 'cooking', 'painting', 'most', 'importantly', 'engine', 'maintenance', 'Chinese', 'labor', 'sailors', 'little', 'do', 'stand', 'watch', 'conduct', 'battle', 'drills', 'look', 'pretty', 'get', 'other', 'nerves.The', 'story', 'cross-cuts', 'ethical', 'political', 'dilemmas', 'American', 'military', 'involvement', 'Far', 'East', 'details', 'story', 'situation', 'Chinese', 'labor-often', 'incompetent-on', 'gunboat', 'American', 'political', 'aims', 'nation', 'beset', 'civil', 'war', 'warlordism', 'difficulty', 'leadership', 'such', 'situation', 'portrayal', 'morality', 'Sinic', 'Civilization', 'China', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'wholly', 'accurate.This', 'movie', 'highlight', 'staring', 'actor', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'quite', 'possibly', 'coolest', 'American', 'actor', 'ever']",N/A

The makers of ""The Sand Pebbles"" cleverly mask their message about Western interventionalism in Eastern affairs by transplanting the setting to 1926 China when revolution was fomenting among the native population and the unfortunate foreigners were trapped in the mire.  Director Robert Wise cleverly weaves a series of unrelated vignettes that gel into a satisfying piece.  Ultimately, there are no easy answers.  There is a sense of forboding doom that permeates this film but that doesn't make for a less compelling experience.  Steve McQueen effectively anchors this film as Jake Holman, engine man on a Navy gunboat.  Holman is a lifer but he also is an idealist which in effect makes him the lightning rod for the troubles that beset his ship.  Richard Attenborough, who was an excellent actor before turning to directing, and Marayat Andriane are superb as the doomed couple.

Shot and released in the mid 1960's by the superlative director Robert Wise, the movie was unfortunately a bit too much ahead of its time, and its subtle anti-Vietnam War message put a lot of viewers and critics of the time off. As a result, this film never got the attention it so richly deserves.Starring Steve McQueen, in what many believe to be his best acting effort ever, the movie shows how good intentions, a lot of ignorance, and unchallenged political and military policy drew the US into unfortunate involvement I the Chinese revolution of 1926.  McQueen plays Jake Holman , a skillful but fiercely independent sailor who joins the ""sand pebble"" crew of the U.S.S. San Pablo, a Navy gunboat patrolling the Yangtze River on the eve of the Chinese revolution. The San Pablo's inexperienced captain (Richard Crenna) obsessively defends the Navy's mission--however unnecessary or unwanted--to protect American missionaries and businessmen, blind to the more dangerous implications of American involvement with China's opposing political factions.  Any of this sound vaguely familiar vis-&agrave;-vis Vietnam?Although Holman would prefer to simply tend his boat's engines he becomes involved with a local missionary/teacher (a very young and breathtakingly beautiful Candice Bergen).  That relationship, the romance of his on board buddy, crewmate ""Frenchy"" Burgoyne with a local Chinese woman, and his friendship with a local ""coolie"", Mako, draw him into the realities of the local situation, with catastrophic consequences.  Holman's anguished ""What the hell happened?"" is a question that would be asked often, and often with even more anquish, as the `60's-and the war-- wore on.Featuring one of the best supporting casts ever assembled, extraordinary acting and direction, a wide ranging and consuming story, exotic locale, amazing action and adventure and tremendous scope and intensity, The Sand Pebbles stands as one of the great epic movies of all time.",5,Quite possibly the best movie you never heard of.,1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,2038,"['San', 'Pebbles', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'movie', 'never', 'heard', 'Shot', 'released', 'mid', '1960', 'superlative', 'director', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'movie', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'ahead', 'time', 'subtle', 'anti-Vietnam', 'War', 'message', 'put', 'lot', 'viewers', 'critics', 'time', 'off', 'result', 'film', 'never', 'got', 'attention', 'so', 'richly', 'deserves.Starring', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'what', 'many', 'believe', 'be', 'best', 'acting', 'effort', 'ever', 'movie', 'how', 'good', 'intentions', 'lot', 'ignorance', 'unchallenged', 'political', 'military', 'policy', 'drew', 'US', 'unfortunate', 'involvement', 'Chinese', 'revolution', '1926', 'McQueen', 'Jake', 'Holman', 'skillful', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'sailor', 'who', 'sand', 'pebble', 'crew', 'U.S.S', 'San', 'Pablo', 'Navy', 'gunboat', 'patrolling', 'Yangtze', 'River', 'eve', 'Chinese', 'revolution', 'San', 'Pablo', 'inexperienced', 'captain', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'obsessively', 'Navy', 'mission', 'however', 'unnecessary', 'unwanted', 'protect', 'American', 'missionaries', 'businessmen', 'blind', 'more', 'dangerous', 'implications', 'American', 'involvement', 'China', 'opposing', 'political', 'factions', 'sound', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'vis-', 'agrave', 'Vietnam', 'Holman', 'would', 'prefer', 'simply', 'tend', 'boat', 'engines', 'involved', 'local', 'missionary/teacher', 'very', 'young', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'relationship', 'romance', 'board', 'buddy', 'crewmate', 'Frenchy', 'Burgoyne', 'local', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'friendship', 'local', 'coolie', 'Mako', 'draw', 'realities', 'local', 'situation', 'catastrophic', 'consequences', 'Holman', 'anguished', 'What', 'hell', 'happened', 'question', 'would', 'be', 'asked', 'often', 'often', 'even', 'more', 'anquish', ""60's-and"", 'war', 'wore', 'on.Featuring', 'one', 'best', 'supporting', 'casts', 'ever', 'assembled', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'direction', 'wide', 'ranging', 'consuming', 'story', 'exotic', 'locale', 'amazing', 'action', 'adventure', 'tremendous', 'scope', 'intensity', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'one', 'great', 'epic', 'movies', 'time']",N/A

The role of Jake Holman, Navy lifer & loner fit the maverick actor like a glove and he was ably supported by a superb cast such as Richard Attenborough (his 2nd film w/McQueen), the late Richard McCrenna, Larry Gates as the pacifist minister and a very young, beautiful Candice Bergen who was just starting to learn to act before her breakthrough performance as Murphy Brown on TV many years later. Robert Wise directed with an emphasis on character development but never ignoring also the spectacle of the story. Outside of McQueen's performance, the late Mako (also an Oscar-nominated performance) is fine as the coolie who McQueen teaches and becomes his friend.  The Blu-ray transfer is superb and if you're a McQueen fan, you won't want to be without this classic!! The points made in this film still ring true even today despite the fact that it took place in the '30s.  They just don't make films like this anymore--and we are poorer for that as well.

Four decades later I saw it again and gained a true appreciation for the acting, the characters, the plot line, and the social commentary.The late Steve McQueen was at his very best in this movie. A good actor in general, ""The Sand Pebbles"" propelled him to greatness. Playing the part of Jake Holman, a Navy machinist whose specialty is the boiler room, he is transferred to the San Pablo (a gunboat) in 1929, during a time of war and near-anarchy in China. From the start, one senses the complexity in McQueen's character, a man who is capable of acting the part of a hard-bitten, cynical career sailor, while at the same time showing a tender side, as he does when he encounters Shirley Eckert, Candace Bergen's character. Caught in the midst of a politically complex situation, Jake Holman's reaction is as complex and multifaceted as the situation itself.Add to McQueen's excellent acting, that of Candace Bergen, Richard Attenborough (Frenchy, another sailor on the San Pablo), and the gunboat's captain, played by Richard Crenna, and one has the makings of an excellent, complex, and compelling drama, one that rivets the viewer's attention throughout, despite its length (3 hours).Produced near the height of the Vietnam War, this drama, which is set in East Asia four decades earlier, aptly portrays the complexity of war, which most often has no easily identified good guys and bad guys. As the drama of the movie unfolds, one quickly senses this reality. The movie makes its point without being preachy. It shows the ambiguity of warfare without having to knock us over the head with the message.Those who like happy endings or ones in which all the loose ends are tied up will be sorely disappointed. Reflecting real life, the ending leaves us with the distinct sense that, after everything has happened, nothing has really been accomplished. Steve McQueen's words at the end sum it up: ""What the hell happened?""",5,McQueen at his best,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,1993,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', '1967', 'when', 'was', '20', 'years', 'old', 'Four', 'decades', 'later', 'saw', 'again', 'gained', 'true', 'appreciation', 'acting', 'characters', 'plot', 'line', 'social', 'commentary.The', 'late', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'was', 'very', 'best', 'movie', 'good', 'actor', 'general', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'propelled', 'greatness', 'Playing', 'part', 'Jake', 'Holman', 'Navy', 'machinist', 'specialty', 'boiler', 'room', 'transferred', 'San', 'Pablo', 'gunboat', '1929', 'time', 'war', 'near-anarchy', 'China', 'start', 'one', 'complexity', 'McQueen', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'capable', 'acting', 'part', 'hard-bitten', 'cynical', 'career', 'sailor', 'same', 'time', 'showing', 'tender', 'side', 'when', 'Shirley', 'Eckert', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'character', 'Caught', 'midst', 'politically', 'complex', 'situation', 'Jake', 'Holman', 'reaction', 'complex', 'multifaceted', 'situation', 'itself.Add', 'McQueen', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'Frenchy', 'sailor', 'San', 'Pablo', 'gunboat', 'captain', 'played', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'one', 'makings', 'excellent', 'complex', 'compelling', 'drama', 'one', 'viewer', 'attention', 'length', '3', 'hours', '.Produced', 'height', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'drama', 'set', 'East', 'Asia', 'four', 'decades', 'earlier', 'aptly', 'complexity', 'war', 'most', 'often', 'easily', 'identified', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'drama', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'one', 'quickly', 'reality', 'movie', 'point', 'being', 'preachy', 'ambiguity', 'warfare', 'having', 'knock', 'head', 'message.Those', 'who', 'happy', 'endings', 'ones', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Reflecting', 'real', 'life', 'ending', 'leaves', 'distinct', 'sense', 'everything', 'happened', 'nothing', 'really', 'been', 'accomplished', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'words', 'end', 'sum', 'What', 'hell', 'happened']",N/A

Solid stories with scripts you could set your watch to and directors who knew their way around a camera. They centered on wars in foreign lands and took big subjects and honed them to a realizable size. his is one of the better of that ilk.Here's the scoop. Jake Holman (Get it? Whole Man?), Played by Steve McQueen, is an engineer in the U.S. Navy, but he's not of the navy. He just wants to be left alone to run the engine room. He's stationd on the San Pablo, a tub of a boat, in China in 1926. The Chinese are ticked at being shoved around by the Brits and Americans and things start to heat up. Some are of the communist persuasion but Chiang Kai Shek is stirring things up as well. The San Pablo is getting caught in the middle and a few decisions by Jake put the ship's safety in the balance.Filmed in Taiwan and Hong Kong this has a good flavor for the Orient. A cast of thousands seems to have been employed and a huge number of junks and sanpans round out the look and feel. This epic (nearly 3 hours long) pretty much deals with Jake trying to keep his tunnel vision in check. But he has an innate sense of right and wrong and it keeps getting him in trouble. Even when he does the right thing, something bad comes of it. His crew considers him a Jonah. Much of the story also deals with the ship wanting to keep its distance from the Chinese but that's an impossibility. The men need shore time so they will frequent the local watering holes and hook up with the local women which will muddy the waters. Minor issues in maintenance end up developing into thick, symbiotic relationships with the locals as well. So when the doo-doo hits the fan things get way too complicated.Steve McQueen is near the top of his game here. He has a natural camera presence to begin with but this almost seems to have been written for him. He disappears into the role. The rest of the cast are no slouches either. I's neat seeing Mako, Joe Turkel, Candice Bergen (her 2nd role) and a host of others early in their careers. Staged, and shot well, this is of an age gone by, but it holds up extremely well. Gerry Goldsmith helms the music and, for the most part, delivers an outstanding score. Robert Wise directed and he seems to have known exactly what he was delivering. He shows a deft hand in the proceedings.This is just one of those great epic films that should translate to any generation.

572960,A35PLIGV8IOW0M,B000059HAF,Francisco Palafox,"[4, 4]","For a fan of The Sand Pebbles this presentation is a no-brainer. I've seldom seen DVDs that give you so much value for-money as this one: a masterpiece movie, beautifully transfered (the theatrical version), plentiful extras and additionally, the complete original roadshow version, granted with flaws, but hey, at least now we have it on DVD. I'm sure there were technical (or economical) reasons for not restoring the roadshow version; it's a shame because it's the preferred one. In the first place it's badly faded (skin tone is reddish, the sea is generally gray or brownish, and scenes are dark overall) and if you've watched the theatrical version first with its clear and beautiful transfer, only real fans will be interested in sitting through the 3-hour-16-minutes run time. In the second place, and as if the bad picture wasn't bad enough, the roadshow version is cropped from 2:35:1 to 2:20:1. This may sound like nitpicking, but if you've watched the theatrical version, you'll notice loss of information at the sides - for example Chapter 29, the scene where the San Pablo is received by a hostile crowd with banners that read ""Give Up Murderer Holman"" only half the message of the banner can be seen. In other scenes characters lose half of their backs or heads; this becomes pretty annoying if you're used to the full image. Some other scenes have complete characters missing from the picture, as in Chapter 4, when Shirley and Mr. Jameson are watching Jake from the boat overlooking the dock. When the camera switches to Jake the full image should show him feel that Shirley and Mr. Jameson are watching him from the boat at the top right edge of the picture, in the roadshow version the cropping loses Shirley and Jameson. On the good side (I'm not sure it compensates the bad), we get 13 minutes that are cut from the Theatrical Version giving us the original Director's Cut. Does the restored footage make a difference? I guess it's not essential to the flow or understanding of the story as presented in the Theatrical Version, but at least a couple of restored scenes give a better insight into the motivation of the characters: 1) In Chapter 24 Shirley asks Jake to show her around town; they have a talk in a restaurant where Shirley gives Jake reasons to leave the Navy, and although he resists Shirley's ""digging in deep"", the seed of desertion has been planted by Shirley. 2) Another interesting scene is the conversation between Capt. Miller and Bordelles in Chapter 28 where Miller gives his reasons for not being stricter with the crew; the line ""I have authority only as long as I don't try to exercise it"" was edited out, I think the line's important to understand Miller's actions. In any case I can't see any reason to cut the 13 minutes of footage other than to make the film 13 minutes shorter which really doesn't make that much difference in the running time. This DVD presentation is an example of how the available film material of classic films should be released to the fans: include all the essential material available. Fans will want to watch the Roadshow Version for the complete running time of the movie (plus the Intermission music) and/or may want to watch the Theatrical Version for its crystal-clear transfer and un-cropped image presentation. To complement, the forthcoming Blu-Ray version should put to rest any further demands from fans.

San Pablo assigned to patrol the Yangtze River. This richly textured Robert Wise film is full of many interesting performances especially from Richard Crenna, Mako, Richard Attenborough and Simon Oakland, and especially Steve McQueen. Crenna's character as the Captain of the San Pablo is truly enigmatic and somehow parallels that of Steve McQueen's seaman Jake Holman who is not restrained from doing the right thing when diplomacy dictates otherwise. Steve McQueen is ordered to the San Pablo for his transgressions and comes to terms with his own cynicism and outward lack of humanity, which has been beaten into his misunderstood past. His relationship with the Mako, whom he trains to maintain the ship's engine makes McQueen see the humanity in himself and those of a different race and culture and realizes the basic good in himself. Mako's tragic death seen is very moving and unforgettable if you have ever seen this film and McQueen's agony touches you like no other film I have ever seen. This film contains one of Jerry Goldsmith's best scores full of brooding bravado and sentiment. This is also one of the best films Robert Wise directed and he truly directed some great ones.

This is one of the ROAD SHOW films of the 1960's. Going to see it in the theater was a special event with a musical prelude and even an intermission. This was the day when films were epics in a way that no longer exists.Steve McQueen stars as Jake Holman in one his signature roles and McQueen had a few. This sprawling story is set in the very volatile China of 1926. It's a mostly forgotten piece of history that foreign warships patroled the rivers of China in the 20's and the country tried to shake itself free of foreign domination.Jake Holman is a lost soul who ends up working in the engine room of the San Pablo.THE SAND PEBBLES might take some liberties with history but the story is as relevant today as it was in the 1960's during the Vietnam War. Here is a story of foreign powers interfering in a nation and culture they do not understand or respect.McQueen heads a stellar cast that includes Richard Crenna, Richard Attenborough and Candice Bergan. Bergen was only 19 and a newcomer to film acting. Her lack of experience is evident but her sweet, gentle nature and beauty do light up the screen.THE SAND PEBBLES is also a testament to the amazing talents of director Robert Wise who directed a very much different and sprawling epic - THE SOUND OF MUSIC. The bonus features on the 2 disc special edition give a good insight into how much detail and effort went into making THE SAND PEBBLES authentic. The warship was even built to be as real as possible.This is a long film that tries to cover the social and political issues of the day along with exploring the lives of American sailors caught up in the drama of a culture they do not understand.

Expected to be an easy filming, this became a seven-month marathon in Taiwan and Hong Kong.  The movie combines a number of stories with historical changes sweeping China in 1926. Considered Steve McQueen's best acting job, he plays a skillful but independent engineer that just wants to maintain the ships engines.  Joining the ""sand pebbles"" on the gunboat U.S.S. San Pablo, patrolling the Yangtze River.  Richard Crenna, one of the most underrated actors of his time, is the Captain obsessively defending the Navy's mission, his ship and the crew.McQueen is a voice of humanity clashing with Crenna's outmoded values and China's inevitable change.  This is a movie of relationships--between McQueen and a young American teacher (19-year-old Candice Bergen, in her second film); the Chinese ""coolie"" (Mako) who he trains to become an engineer and crewmate Richard Attenborough and the Chinese woman Attenborough loves. The film's supporting cast is some of the best character actors of the times with strong roles that fit their personas. This is a film with adventurous scope, a climactic battle scenes, multiple story lines, excellent writing and beautiful cinematography.This DVD contains the theatrical and road show versions of the film.

In that case, I will stop short of imitating New Zealand reviewer Peter Hoogenboom, but I must flatter him at least a little. His 2007 review of The Sand Pebbles hits all the right notes for me.www.amazon.com/review/R4IMKMD7J41TFFor my own part, I love Steve McQueen's coolness. It works swimmingly in films likeBullittandThe Thomas Crown Affair. But if we are being honest, the King Of Cool did not have the same range as other leading men. He admitted as much: ""I am a limited actor. My range isn't that great and I don't have that much scope."" Famously, he excused himself from a chance to star inClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Steven Spielberg wanted McQueen, who said he was unable to cry on film. (Richard Dreyfuss, a Spielberg favorite, took the role and knocked it out of the park.)McQueen's limited sweet spot is on full exhibit in The Sand Pebbles. Nor is he helped by his castmates. Young Candice Bergen is as wooden as a dinghy, her chemistry with McQueen is inorganic (get it?), and Richard Crenna is without interest until the final half hour. Richard Attenborough stands out among the lead actors for emotional range and on-screen presence.So how was this film nominated for eight Academy Awards? It didn't win any, but, still. The second act was trending in the right direction, but could not save the sinking ship that was this very long and very disappointing film.Like Mr. Hoogenboom says, The Sand Pebbles offers interesting historical insight. I fear that may be its only redeeming quality. Certainly I have seen better war films (likeSaving Private Ryan) and I have seen McQueen cast far better (see above). If I wanted to get depressed by sublime acting, I would watchFive Easy Pieces.NOTE: I have the Region 2 release (The Sand Pebbles). The one with a big typo on the front.

572993,A356RFKNIG043B,B000059HAF,K. Swanson,"[14, 14]","Some movies don't age well. Others get better as time goes by. Put The Sand Pebbles in the latter category; its message of racial tolerance and subtle, intelligent questioning of American gunboat diplomacy seems more relevant than ever right now, and the overall quality of the film makes it shine brightly, 34 years on.Bob Wise made many great films, but this may be his best, on par with The Sound Of Music, I'd say. Steve McQueen made some fine movies, and this may be his peak. Ditto Richard Crenna; his is in fact probably the finest performance here, a true tour de force. Attenborough is also splendid, as is Bergen, who combines innocence and intelligence in a lovely, understated way. Mako as well says volumes while saying little. The cinematography is gorgeous, as are the locations in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Jerry Goldsmith turns in a typically perfect score. There is in fact almost nothing not way above average for '60s Hollywood here. Or any period of cinema, in fact.At over 3 hours, a film has got to be good to keep you committed. Sand Pebbles does that easily, with a tight script and emotional tension that never lets up. Its frank and for the time unusually brave assessment of American imperialism rings true decades later, and seems quite prescient (when if ever will we get The Afghan Pebbles?). There's more depth on most every level here than we get these days, to be sure. And yet there's also understatement and elegance to spare. It feels like a big budget studio film but looks like real art, a combination all too rare in any cinematic era. And considering that China now owns more of our debt than any other country, and we just keep borrowing more for yet another wonderful war, the messages here about Chinese-American relations have a real resonance. Some of this film looks very racist by today's standards, no doubt, and really makes one reconsider how we treat and have treated other nations and peoples. Only a truly great film can tackle so many issues and still be warm and heartfelt; Sand Pebbles is one of a kind, a true classic.If only all old classics got this kind of reverent blu-ray package! There's nothing lacking here, from a perfect transfer that seems like you're back in the theater in December 1966 to hours of extras. An hour doc on the film that's very good; short docs on McQueen (everybody loved him, it seems), Wise (the same), the ship, etc. Radio spots. A separate film score (ALL films with good scores should have this! ALL of them! Can you hear us out there in Hollyweird?) with commentary yet, an even rarer thing; a main commentary; interviews with most of the old stars; deleted scenes, a few of which I wish had been in the film (Steve and Candice in a tough little talk, and a perfect McQueen/Attenborough exchange that sums up the heart of the film in one line: ""What do you call her?"" Don't miss that one); and more.

572995,A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ,B000059HAF,Larry Scantlebury,"[0, 0]","I was writing a review of Barry Newman's ""Vanishing Point"" and I drew a parallel to the Jake Holman role in ""The Sand Pebbles."" Naturally, it stuck in my mind and I had to go to the library to rent it. So . . .I don't think of ""The Sand Pebbles"" (America's 'presence' in an Asian country in the 1920's) as the quintessential McQeen role. However I do think he's brilliant in it and generally his body of work is of such consequence that you can say he was an extraordinary actor, certainly in the top 10 of that generation of actors.The movie plots the American 'presence' in China, and has since drawn praise from those that would assign to Hollywood the current watch dog, early warning system of political error on the part of our leaders, then, as a warning about our involvement in Vietnam. God forbid.Additionally, the script is taken from a novel 4 years earlier in 1962 when there was little if any involvement in Southeast Asia, except for the French licking their wounds. Ya'll got to remember that Hollwood's goal is to make dinero, not be the conscience of America.Nevertheless there is an uncanny symbolic illustration of what was happening to us and would happn to us over the next 9 years after the movie's release in 1966. Jake's last line and the last spoken line of the movie, ""What the hell happened?"" is a triple entendre representing, inter alia, what was going to happen to us, did happen to us, and like Roy Hobbs in ""The Natural,"" that 'we should have seen it coming.' Robert Wise's not saying it but to leave it on our plate without explanation gives a lot of credit in this reviewer's mind as that was exactly what he meant. If so, kudos.Richard Crenna is excellent as the skipper of the San Pablo, sent on the ill defined (to this day) mission of being a show of force to the Chinese along the Yangtze (sic) River. Richard Attenborough provides great support. And I have to tell you, I liked the young and skinny Candace Bergan as the missionary's daughter.Great, great, great movie and it should be in your library. 5 stars.

Directed by Robert Wise, it gleaned nine academy award nominations. I remember reading the book a very long time ago, and remember it as an adventure story. But by watching this DVD, I see now that it is much more. And I also see how it relates to what is happening in the world today.The setting is China in 1926. Violent conflicts were everywhere. Warlords were fighting each other, and the Nationalist leader Chang Kai-Shek was gaining power. In addition, the Communists were fighting against the Nationalists. Because the U.S. had interests there, they had a few Navy gunboats going up and down the river. They weren't supposed to do anything - just be a show a force. But the Chinese, from all the different factions, wanted the Americans out. ""Go Home Foreigners"" was their battle cry. The Americans knew that at any moment an international incident could erupt. Sound familiar?Steve McQueen, in the best performance of his career, is cast as a Navy machinist on the gunboat, which was nicknamed the ""Sand Pebbles"". When he joins the crew, he's surprised to discover that the ""Coolies"" do all the hard work - everything from cooking to cutting hair to running the engine. He opposes this as he wants to run the engine himself, and after some conflict, and an accidental death, he befriends one of the Coolies, and teaches him how to run the boat. Later, there are violent consequences.There is tension throughout between McQueen and the crew for many reasons. And we soon know who the good guys and the bad guys are. Richard Attenborough plays a good guy. He falls in love with a young Chinese woman in bondage to the local house of pleasure. Another good guy is the Captain of the ship, played by Richard Crenna. He believes in ideals and is determined to act with valor even though he has to make some hard choices. Steve McQueen is the ultimate good guy though. He acts on instinct and every move is from the heart.Then there's the crew who treat the Coolies badly and fight against every improvement that McQueen wants to implement. They also are willing to almost cause a mutiny when an incident occurs in which the Chinese call for McQueen's blood. We also see the naivety of the missionaries, one of whom is Candice Bergen, who think that by declaring themselves ""stateless persons"" the Chinese will not see them as Americans. The film is a series of battles. Some of the battles are with guns. Others are moral ones. Together they create a huge mosaic of high adventure coupled with questions of intervention. There are no easy answers.The DVD has several features by Robert Wise in which he discusses the making of the film. However, to my disappointment, they are all in audio only. We hear his voice superimposed over a static scene or the logo from the film. After all the high adventure of the film, I was bored by these and didn't watch them.However, the film stands alone on its own. It's almost three hours long, but yet every moment is action packed with complex interweaving stories. There isn't one dull part and all of the acting is great. I loved it. I therefore give it an extremely high recommendation.

The parallel is obvious: China in the 1920s was a divided country with foreign powers meddling in its internal affairs and supporting the opposing sides of the civil war. Japan had invaded, the USSR supported the Communists, the Western powers supported the Nationalists. Western powers did not invade but had a military presence on the coast and, as this film shows, inland as well.It is an anti-colonial film too. It shows how China, while not strictly speaking colonized, had been in fact the object of foreign interference and prevarication for many decades. Yet the film also shows the brutality of the colonialists' victims, with Chinese killing Chinese, sometimes for very little reason.The human dimension of the film reminds me of Vietnam too. Frenchy falls in love with a Chinese woman and wants to marry her amidst many difficulties, just as it happened for many GIs in Vietnam.The Blu-ray edition also contains interesting extra features, like an interview with the director and cut scenes, as well as a ""the making of"" featurette.

573008,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B000059HAF,Martin Asiner,"[3, 5]","When THE SAND PEBBLES was released in 1966, it was hailed as a terrific war movie for the usual reasons: strong character development, believable dialogue, horrific battle scenes, and a strong sense of good versus evil. Unknown to the general public was director Robert Wise's unerring eye for what was going on in the rest on SouthEast Asia. The action of the movie takes place in China in 1926. That decade saw a cleaving of China into many chunks, with each chunk contested by a warlord. And out of all of them Chang Kai Chek was the most powerful.Steve McQueen is Jake Holman, a sailor on a US Navy vessel trapped in the Yangtsee River. He loves his engines almost as much as he loves his girlfriend, played by Candace Bergen. Theirs is a love story that cannot have a happy ending. She is a missionary whose father blames the United States for unrest in the area surrounding his mission house. His antipathy towards Jake combined with her unwillingness to cross her father ensures that their romance cannot be. Paralleling Jake's romance is a similarly doomed affair between his best friend Frenchy (Richard Attenborough) and a local prostitute. The gap in culture between east and west proves debilitating for both couples. THE SAND PEBBLES is not simply a war film with a pair of Hollywood romances tacked on. It is also a tale of male bonding between Jake and his captain (Richard Crenna) who tries to balance a stern sense of military leadership against a growing realization that a failed American policy regarding the stability of Chang Kai Chek's government renders moot any attempt on his part to pacify hostility between his crew and nearly all the Chinese with whom they come in contact. Adding to the brew of disaster is the mistaken belief by many of the crew that Jake is some sort of albatross who ought to be turned over to the Chinese authorities who blame him for the death of Frenchy's wife.Now fast forward some 40 years from 1926. America is engaged in struggle in Vietnam, a country rent by local power squabbles and a growing threat from the Communist north. The destruction of the formerly stable Chinese culture of 1926 is prefigured by the similar dissolution of a Vietnamese culture with cheap saloons and brothels as the central metaphor. Midway through the movie, Jake sees a vicious yet all too common brothel scene in which Frenchy's girl is auctioned off to the highest bidder. It is impossible to view this scene without recognizing that many such scenes were duplicated in countless Saigon honkytonks.THE SAND PEBBLES truly is a magnificent film. It recreates the aura of a time when America tried to flex its muscles in foreign ports with predictable and disastrous results. On a purely cinematic level, you can feel the angst of both Westerners who cry out ""What the hell happened"" and Easterners who reply ""Leave us alone."" On a metaphorical level, THE SAND PEBBLES unites Jake's closing question with a Chinese desire for non-interference to produce a film that resonates with the eternal struggle between well-intentioned colonialism with the colonials' right to settle disputes with autonomy.",5,Sand Pebbles: Two Wars in One,1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,3136,"['When', 'SAND', 'PEBBLES', 'was', 'released', '1966', 'was', 'hailed', 'terrific', 'war', 'movie', 'usual', 'reasons', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'horrific', 'battle', 'scenes', 'strong', 'sense', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'general', 'public', 'was', 'director', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'unerring', 'eye', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'rest', 'SouthEast', 'Asia', 'action', 'movie', 'place', 'China', '1926', 'decade', 'saw', 'cleaving', 'China', 'many', 'chunks', 'chunk', 'contested', 'warlord', 'Chang', 'Kai', 'Chek', 'was', 'most', 'powerful.Steve', 'McQueen', 'Jake', 'Holman', 'sailor', 'US', 'Navy', 'vessel', 'trapped', 'Yangtsee', 'River', 'engines', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'Theirs', 'love', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'missionary', 'father', 'United', 'States', 'unrest', 'area', 'surrounding', 'mission', 'house', 'antipathy', 'towards', 'Jake', 'combined', 'unwillingness', 'cross', 'father', 'romance', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'Paralleling', 'Jake', 'romance', 'similarly', 'doomed', 'affair', 'best', 'friend', 'Frenchy', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'local', 'prostitute', 'gap', 'culture', 'east', 'west', 'proves', 'debilitating', 'couples', 'SAND', 'PEBBLES', 'not', 'simply', 'war', 'film', 'pair', 'Hollywood', 'romances', 'tacked', 'also', 'tale', 'male', 'bonding', 'Jake', 'captain', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'who', 'balance', 'stern', 'sense', 'military', 'leadership', 'growing', 'realization', 'failed', 'American', 'policy', 'regarding', 'stability', 'Chang', 'Kai', 'Chek', 'government', 'renders', 'moot', 'attempt', 'part', 'pacify', 'hostility', 'crew', 'nearly', 'Chinese', 'whom', 'come', 'contact', 'Adding', 'brew', 'disaster', 'mistaken', 'belief', 'many', 'crew', 'Jake', 'sort', 'albatross', 'who', 'ought', 'be', 'turned', 'Chinese', 'authorities', 'who', 'blame', 'death', 'Frenchy', 'wife.Now', 'fast', 'forward', '40', 'years', '1926', 'America', 'engaged', 'struggle', 'Vietnam', 'country', 'rent', 'local', 'power', 'squabbles', 'growing', 'threat', 'Communist', 'north', 'destruction', 'formerly', 'stable', 'Chinese', 'culture', '1926', 'prefigured', 'similar', 'dissolution', 'Vietnamese', 'culture', 'cheap', 'saloons', 'brothels', 'central', 'metaphor', 'Midway', 'movie', 'Jake', 'vicious', 'yet', 'too', 'common', 'brothel', 'scene', 'Frenchy', 'girl', 'auctioned', 'highest', 'bidder', 'impossible', 'view', 'scene', 'recognizing', 'many', 'such', 'scenes', 'were', 'duplicated', 'countless', 'Saigon', 'honkytonks.THE', 'SAND', 'PEBBLES', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'film', 'aura', 'time', 'when', 'America', 'tried', 'flex', 'muscles', 'foreign', 'ports', 'predictable', 'disastrous', 'results', 'purely', 'cinematic', 'level', 'can', 'feel', 'angst', 'Westerners', 'who', 'cry', 'out', 'What', 'hell', 'happened', 'Easterners', 'who', 'reply', 'Leave', 'alone', 'metaphorical', 'level', 'SAND', 'PEBBLES', 'Jake', 'closing', 'question', 'Chinese', 'desire', 'non-interference', 'produce', 'film', 'eternal', 'struggle', 'well-intentioned', 'colonialism', 'colonials', 'right', 'settle', 'disputes', 'autonomy']",N/A

With that said, this review is going to deal with the actual Blu Ray transfer , both video and audio , and not the plot or performances contained in it.First off, The Sand Pebbles is a LONG movie. At just over 3 hours long it has found it's way to Blu Ray in high style, with a quality transfer sourced from an almost impeccable print and a remixed 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio soundtrack that does nothing but enhance the overall experience.20th Century Fox has managed to cram both the movie itself and the bonus features onto 1 disc and still retain a high quality image.  The Sand Pebbles, being of the 60's , does not feature brilliant vibrant ""spectrum of the rainbow"" type colors, keeping within the style of the times and the intent of the director and DP and the film stock used.  It does however feature natural color in every scene.  Never over-saturated and no terrible fading either.  I found it most satisfying on that level, along with a stable, wobble free image.  In addition , the image has no discernible DNR, edge enhancement, banding or black crush and the shadow detail is also very strong. Contrast wavers in a few small places, but never for very long. Also, a very few softer looking scenes crop up from time to time, but again they are very few.  Natural film grain and fine detail are the order of the day here.The BD-50 dual layer disc seems to be fully utilized here, considering how lengthy this movie is.  Honestly, it really is a nice rendering and a real joy to look at in the Blu Ray format.The soundtrack with music by the late great Jerry Goldsmith fares just as well as the picture quality. (IMHO)  The music has been obviously remixed to take advantage of the 5.1 format and is both lush and crystal clear.  Ambient effects are spread through the surrounds, but never obtrusive or gimmicky. My only complaint would be that sometimes the dialogue may be a bit 'tinny' and a few times it gets just slightly clipped or distorted, but always intelligible and easy to understand. The majority of the dialogue sounds just fine and is much better than I had hoped for a film of this age and era.  The original recordings were obviously made with care for this much quality to shine through in a lossless audio presentation.  The separation and expanse of the music mix is very very good and on my Denon/Klipsch system it had me feeling I was at the Cinerama!  Cool!The extras include some great commentaries including an isolated score track. Over 2 and 1/2 hours of documentaries are also included plus a stills gallery, radio spots , the original trailer and more.  All told, this is one amazing package and shows just how great the Blu Ray format can be by fitting it all on just one disc while retaining a very high level of quality.No doubt about it, The Sand Pebbles is a film classic and this Blu Ray release is THE way to see it at home. A 5.1 surround system that decodes DTS-HD Master Audio will reveal a beautiful and engaging soundtrack to complement the gorgeous 1080p visuals.  Also, this disc is NOT Java encumbered and as such the disc resume feature will WORK which is good if you can't sit for the entire 3 hours without a break.For McQueen fans and classic film fans in general this is a great purchase and a fine addition to anyone's personal video library!",5,Gorgeous Blu Ray Transfer for McQueen Classic!,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,3390,"['am', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'fan', 'think', 'movie', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'performances', 'said', 'review', 'going', 'deal', 'actual', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'video', 'audio', 'not', 'plot', 'performances', 'contained', 'it.First', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'LONG', 'movie', 'just', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'found', 'way', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'high', 'style', 'quality', 'transfer', 'sourced', 'almost', 'impeccable', 'print', 'remixed', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'audio', 'soundtrack', 'nothing', 'enhance', 'overall', 'experience.20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'managed', 'cram', 'movie', 'bonus', '1', 'disc', 'still', 'retain', 'high', 'quality', 'image', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'being', '60', 'not', 'feature', 'brilliant', 'vibrant', 'spectrum', 'rainbow', 'type', 'colors', 'keeping', 'style', 'times', 'intent', 'director', 'DP', 'film', 'stock', 'used', 'however', 'feature', 'natural', 'color', 'scene', 'over-saturated', 'terrible', 'fading', 'found', 'most', 'satisfying', 'level', 'stable', 'wobble', 'free', 'image', 'addition', 'image', 'discernible', 'DNR', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'banding', 'black', 'crush', 'shadow', 'detail', 'also', 'very', 'strong', 'Contrast', 'wavers', 'few', 'small', 'places', 'never', 'very', 'long', 'Also', 'very', 'few', 'softer', 'looking', 'scenes', 'crop', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'Natural', 'film', 'grain', 'fine', 'detail', 'are', 'order', 'day', 'here.The', 'BD-50', 'dual', 'layer', 'disc', 'be', 'fully', 'utilized', 'here', 'considering', 'how', 'lengthy', 'movie', 'Honestly', 'really', 'nice', 'rendering', 'real', 'joy', 'look', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'format.The', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'late', 'great', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'picture', 'quality', 'IMHO', 'music', 'been', 'obviously', 'remixed', 'take', 'advantage', '5.1', 'format', 'lush', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Ambient', 'effects', 'are', 'spread', 'surrounds', 'never', 'obtrusive', 'gimmicky', 'only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'sometimes', 'dialogue', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'few', 'times', 'just', 'slightly', 'clipped', 'distorted', 'always', 'intelligible', 'easy', 'understand', 'majority', 'dialogue', 'just', 'fine', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'hoped', 'film', 'age', 'era', 'original', 'recordings', 'were', 'obviously', 'made', 'care', 'much', 'quality', 'shine', 'lossless', 'audio', 'presentation', 'separation', 'expanse', 'music', 'mix', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Denon/Klipsch', 'system', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'Cinerama', 'Cool', 'extras', 'include', 'great', 'commentaries', 'including', 'isolated', 'score', 'track', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'documentaries', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'stills', 'gallery', 'radio', 'spots', 'original', 'trailer', 'more', 'told', 'one', 'amazing', 'package', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'format', 'can', 'be', 'fitting', 'just', 'one', 'disc', 'retaining', 'very', 'high', 'level', 'quality.No', 'doubt', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'film', 'classic', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'way', 'see', 'home', '5.1', 'surround', 'system', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'will', 'reveal', 'beautiful', 'engaging', 'soundtrack', 'complement', 'gorgeous', '1080p', 'visuals', 'Also', 'disc', 'NOT', 'Java', 'encumbered', 'such', 'disc', 'resume', 'feature', 'will', 'WORK', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'entire', '3', 'hours', 'break.For', 'McQueen', 'fans', 'classic', 'film', 'fans', 'general', 'great', 'purchase', 'fine', 'addition', 'anyone', 'personal', 'video', 'library']",N/A

It's what great filmmaking can and should be all about.Although this film is about China at the turn of the Century- about conflict, occupation or presence of one nation by other nations, and political confusion- it's really about people and how we're moving through a wind that can change direction at any turn, leaving us directionless.The amazing thing about this film and all of its character's is how they all make up the whole of what we, as human beings, are all about. And every one of them is right in their own belief system. Crenna's Captain is a moral man, looking to represent America's military presence in as precise and diplomatic way as he can. The missionary's stance is equally correct. 'Damn all flags'. McQueen's 'Holman' is the most impressive of all. Self contained and committed to nothing, initially, he grows the most to offer the final summation of this film. 'I don't have any more enemies' and ' come with me, we're going to a place where it doesn't matter who we are. We'll all be the same, there'.

It's a type of music my kids listen to so I asked my daughter if she knew who Steve McQueen was.  She had a vaque idea that he was once an actor.  He was.  He may have not been a Laurence Olivier but his was a commanding presence.  Fortunately, he left behind a number of good, very good and several great movies.  All things considered, ""The Sand Pebbles"" was the most impressive to me.This movie qualifies as an epic film.  It has all of those essential requirements; great costumes, realistic sets, great acting, great directing, great music, interaction with history, and more (including, if you saw it in a theatre, an intermission).  This movie focusses on some of the back pages of 20th Century history; China during the time of the war lords.  We follow the sailors of a minor gun boat; the San Pablo.  Most of the men are from the fringe of American society.  Most want to just put in their 20 years and retire on pension and buy a bar in Shanghai or some such place.  Whatever makes life easier is good and whatever gets them closer to retirement is better.  Along come a engineer, Jake Holman (McQueen) who just wants a ship's engine that he can operate alone in his own little world.  Unfortunately, he finds that there is a system on the ship that leaves much of the work to Chinese ""coolies"".  In his attempts to change the system, he alienates the rest of the crew.  This may not sound like a very compelling plot.  However, events start to happen, much of them as a result of the shakeup that Holman has caused on the ship.  Ultimately, the San Pablo is called into action and the movie ends fairly climatically.As with most epic pictures, a lot of interpersonal relationships develop in this movie.  The primary one is between McQueen and Candice Bergen who has come to China to help with a Christian mission.  There is another relationship between a shipmate named Frenchy and a Chinese girl but the movie stays focussed on Jake Holman and how he changes from a loner to someone who finds himself more and more putting it on the line for someone else.  The movie ends with this transformation placed in an ironic perspective.Some would argue that his performance in ""Bullitt"" was his best acting.  However, ""The Sand Pebbles"" was Steve McQueen's only Oscar nomination.

573026,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000059HAF,Reviewer,"[224, 232]","Steve McQueen was known for many things-- action films, fast cars, motorcycles, a charismatic presence (on screen and off), and his true ""tough guy"" persona.  But with this film, another description moves to the top of that list:  Actor.  Anyone who doubts what a great actor McQueen was need only watch this film, because his performance here as Jake Holman is simply as good as it gets.  ""The Sand Pebbles, "" directed by Robert Wise, is the story of Holman, a sailor assigned to the U.S. Gunboat, ""San Pablo,"" stationed on the Yangtze River in China in 1926 (the sailors aboard are known as ""sand pebbles"").  It's primary function is to patrol the river and thereby establish an American presence in China, a country currently experiencing a period of political unrest and impending upheaval.  It's a new assignment for Holman, and it suits him just fine; his job is to keep the ship's engines up and running, and because of the size of the ship, he's the only engineer-- it's just Jake and his engine.  And that's the way he likes it.  Holman is a loner by nature, and something of an iconoclast.  At one point, when he is asked his opinion of American Foreign Policy and their presence in China, he simply says, ""I don't mess with it.  It's all look-see-pidgin, somethin' for the officers.""Eventually, however, Holman is nevertheless drawn into the conflict through a series of events that impact him beyond all personal resistance, the most significant being when American lives are threatened throughout China, and Holman and a landing party are sent ashore to protect and escort some missionaries back to the safety of the San Pablo.  But at the mission, Holman discovers a way of life, the likes of which he's never known, and for the first time ever, he realizes a sense of belonging.  And he likes it.  For Holman, however, it may be too late; the political turmoil throughout the country has put the lives of everyone at the mission in peril, including a young missionary named Shirley Eckert (Candice Bergen), with whom Holman has made a connection he simply cannot dispel; for in Shirley, he discerns an innocence and a goodness that compels him, and in which he finds a welcome sense of fulfillment.  So what began as a routine mission becomes a salient point in Holman's life, and he is faced with the most important decision he's ever had to make.This is the one for which McQueen should have won an Oscar.  As Holman, he demonstrates an emotional range and depth that runs the gamut from almost boyish naivete to a world weary veteran of life who has seen and heard it all.  Utterly convincing, he can say more with a slight incline of his head, a slow blink or shifting of his eyes than most actors could say with reams of dialogue at their disposal.  He communicates with so much more than words, and there's meaning in everything he says and does-- he never wastes a line or a single moment.  What he does with this role is magnificent; it's the definitive McQueen performance.  His Holman is the personification of the loner, and in creating him he delivers something few actors could ever equal:  He's tough, convincing and charming-- all at the same time.  And he should've taken home The Statue for it.As Collins, the Captain of the San Pablo, Richard Crenna gives one of his finest performances, as well, and it cemented his transition from television actor to a career on the big screen.  After this, there was no going back.  His portrayal of the somber, introspective Captain is riveting, and in him you readily perceive Collins' sense of duty and honor, as well as his overwhelming sense of futility and failure.  And the urgency with which he grasps his chance for redemption, even in the face of insurmountable odds, is entirely believable as it is consistent with the character he has created.The superlative supporting cast includes Richard Attenborough (Frenchy), Emmanuelle Arsan (Maily), Mako (Po-han), Larry Gates (Jameson), Charles Robinson (Bordelles), Simon Oakland (Stawski), Ford Rainey (Harris), Joe Turkel (Bronson) and Gavin MacLeod (Crosley).  A powerful drama, extremely well crafted and presented by Wise, ""The Sand Pebbles"" is a great and memorable film that will forever stand as the pinnacle of McQueen's successful career.  Jake Holman is a character you will never forget, because there is something of him-- that wistful longing to belong, perhaps-- in all of us.  A timeless classic among classics, this is one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, and is by definition, the magic of the movies.",5,McQueen's Greatest Performance,991872000,"06 7, 2001",2001,4557,"['Steve', 'McQueen', 'was', 'known', 'many', 'things', 'action', 'films', 'fast', 'cars', 'motorcycles', 'charismatic', 'presence', 'screen', 'off', 'true', 'tough', 'guy', 'persona', 'film', 'description', 'top', 'list', 'Actor', 'Anyone', 'who', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'McQueen', 'was', 'need', 'only', 'watch', 'film', 'performance', 'here', 'Jake', 'Holman', 'simply', 'as', 'good', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'story', 'Holman', 'sailor', 'assigned', 'U.S.', 'Gunboat', 'San', 'Pablo', 'stationed', 'Yangtze', 'River', 'China', '1926', 'sailors', 'are', 'known', 'sand', 'pebbles', 'primary', 'function', 'patrol', 'river', 'thereby', 'establish', 'American', 'presence', 'China', 'country', 'currently', 'experiencing', 'period', 'political', 'unrest', 'impending', 'upheaval', 'new', 'assignment', 'Holman', 'suits', 'just', 'fine', 'job', 'keep', 'ship', 'engines', 'up', 'running', 'size', 'ship', 'only', 'engineer', 'just', 'Jake', 'engine', 'way', 'Holman', 'loner', 'nature', 'something', 'iconoclast', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'asked', 'opinion', 'American', 'Foreign', 'Policy', 'presence', 'China', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'look-see-pidgin', 'somethin', 'officers', 'Eventually', 'however', 'Holman', 'nevertheless', 'drawn', 'conflict', 'series', 'events', 'impact', 'personal', 'resistance', 'most', 'significant', 'being', 'when', 'American', 'lives', 'are', 'threatened', 'China', 'Holman', 'landing', 'party', 'are', 'sent', 'ashore', 'protect', 'escort', 'missionaries', 'back', 'safety', 'San', 'Pablo', 'mission', 'Holman', 'way', 'life', 'likes', 'never', 'known', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'sense', 'belonging', 'Holman', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'political', 'turmoil', 'country', 'put', 'lives', 'everyone', 'mission', 'peril', 'including', 'young', 'missionary', 'named', 'Shirley', 'Eckert', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'whom', 'Holman', 'made', 'connection', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'dispel', 'Shirley', 'innocence', 'goodness', 'welcome', 'sense', 'fulfillment', 'what', 'began', 'routine', 'mission', 'salient', 'point', 'Holman', 'life', 'faced', 'most', 'important', 'decision', 'ever', 'had', 'make.This', 'one', 'McQueen', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Holman', 'emotional', 'range', 'depth', 'gamut', 'almost', 'boyish', 'naivete', 'world', 'weary', 'veteran', 'life', 'who', 'seen', 'heard', 'Utterly', 'convincing', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'slight', 'incline', 'head', 'slow', 'blink', 'shifting', 'eyes', 'most', 'actors', 'could', 'say', 'reams', 'dialogue', 'disposal', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'words', 'meaning', 'everything', 'never', 'line', 'single', 'moment', 'What', 'role', 'magnificent', 'definitive', 'McQueen', 'performance', 'Holman', 'personification', 'loner', 'creating', 'something', 'few', 'actors', 'could', 'ever', 'equal', 'tough', 'convincing', 'charming', 'same', 'time', 'should', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'home', 'Statue', 'it.As', 'Collins', 'Captain', 'San', 'Pablo', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'cemented', 'transition', 'television', 'actor', 'career', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'going', 'back', 'portrayal', 'somber', 'introspective', 'Captain', 'riveting', 'readily', 'perceive', 'Collins', 'sense', 'duty', 'honor', 'as', 'well', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'futility', 'failure', 'urgency', 'grasps', 'chance', 'redemption', 'even', 'face', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'entirely', 'believable', 'consistent', 'character', 'created.The', 'superlative', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'Frenchy', 'Emmanuelle', 'Arsan', 'Maily', 'Mako', 'Po-han', 'Larry', 'Gates', 'Jameson', 'Charles', 'Robinson', 'Bordelles', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'Stawski', 'Ford', 'Rainey', 'Harris', 'Joe', 'Turkel', 'Bronson', 'Gavin', 'MacLeod', 'Crosley', 'powerful', 'drama', 'extremely', 'well', 'crafted', 'presented', 'Wise', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'great', 'memorable', 'film', 'will', 'forever', 'stand', 'pinnacle', 'McQueen', 'successful', 'career', 'Jake', 'Holman', 'character', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'something', 'wistful', 'longing', 'belong', 'perhaps', 'timeless', 'classic', 'classics', 'one', 'greatest', 'motion', 'pictures', 'time', 'definition', 'magic', 'movies']",N/A

This is a wonderful story of the intersection between Western culture and Old China, in the period when China was seeking to emerge as a modern nation.This is the story of one Jake Holman, a sailor in the American gunboat navy in China.  The Navy's mission is to protect American/Western missionaries, businessmen, their lives and property.  Holman serves on the USS San Pablo, known to her crew as the &quot;Sand Pebble.&quot;  Holman has a passion for engines, and sought to serve on the Sand Pebble on the notion that his engineering expertise would make him valuable and autonomous aboard.  Instead, he learns that each American sailor has a Chinese servant who actually performs all of that sailor's routine duties.  Holman is thus effectively prevented from performing his engineering role.  Nor are the Chinese, untrained in engineering and acting by wrote, able to safely handle the ship's power plant.  An undercurrent to the story is Holman's struggle to get control of the management of the ship's antiquated but essential engines.Holman's struggles to establish his place on the ship take place against the panorama of a China seeking to throw off foreign domination and become a modern nation-state.  This is the larger story, effectively presented in this excellent film.This film is a reasonably faithful adaptation of the bestselling novel of the same name.

Frenchie, falls for a Chinese woman, who is a hostess in a brothel. He recognizes her innocence and wants to protect her while the sailors (and even the SPs (shore patrol)) want to do something more carnal.  Frenchie wants to raise the 200 dollars needed to free her.  He ends up marrying her -- which in reality costs him his life.Steve McQueen's character Jake is a conflicted Navy sailor.  He just wants to work on his engines and that's it!  Except when he gets to the San Pablo (Sand Pebbles) that the ship is being run by coolies (Chinese laborers); often being taken advantage of and treated like second class citizens (""slope heads""); Jake is again conflicted -- should he go along with the clearly illegal Chinese labor aboard or do the work himself?  He sees things wrong with engine too.  ""But we've never had trouble before,"" says his wimpy & weak captain (in my opinion!).  Why make waves, Jake?  Jake going along with it costs a man his life.Jake is also conflicted about being forced to fight -- men die, he feels conflicted.  Being forced to kill a friend, he feels rebellious.  Quit the whole thing, go back to the missionary settlement at China Light and run away with Candice Bergen (a very fine 18 year old in this picture).  Fate has other plans.And the captain, well-played by Richard Crenna.  He gets to a point where he feels he has failed his men, failed the Navy and his country.  At one point he tries to take the coward's way out and becomes suicidal -- this changes as the civil war in China takes international proportions.The story is very complex and it's difficult for me to write an entire plot summary, so I won't.  I will say that the realism, the expanding cinematography, and literally a cast of thousands make this one of Richard Wise's best films.  It was at this time he filmed Sound of Music as well.  Wise clearly has range!Highly recommended, even for the viewer with a mere layman's understanding of the history of the USA, Britain and the conflict in China in the 1920s!  An hours-long drama, filled with combat, love, honor, and even conflict and cowardice!

The action star gives a brilliant performance as Jake Holman, an American ex-patriate assigned to an all-but-forgotten gunboat patrolling the Yangtze River in the early 1900s.  Holman's desire to do right--including treating the Chinese coolies aboard as human beings, rather than latter-day slaves, and helping a good-natured friend (Richard Attenborough) realize his romance for an abused Chinese woman--clashes with the misdirected and often selfish sensibilities of those around him, especially his prideful but immasculated commanding officer (Richard Crenna), leading to a series of tragedies that Holman is powerless to avert.  Director Robert Wise, whose films range from brilliant to lackluster, is in top form here, giving &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; a sense of David Lean-esque largesse without ever losing sight of the characters, even in the heat of battle.  Jerry Goldsmith's score will stay with you long after the final credits roll.  Even with the film's plot about factions in an Asian country opposing foreign attempts to control it a thinly veiled allegory to Viet Nam, &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; never devolves into an Americans-good/Chinese-bad melodrama; like real life, it is often subtle, complex, exhilerating, tragic, and haunting.",5,An Instant Classic,1042502400,"01 14, 2003",2003,1492,"['greatly', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'quot', 'Whom', 'Bell', 'Tolls', 'quot', 'tense', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'vehicle', 'pulls', 'few', 'punches', 'delivering', 'timely', 'message', 'futility', 'imperialism', 'war', 'purpose', 'action', 'star', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Jake', 'Holman', 'American', 'ex-patriate', 'assigned', 'all-but-forgotten', 'gunboat', 'patrolling', 'Yangtze', 'River', 'early', '1900s', 'Holman', 'desire', 'do', 'right', 'including', 'treating', 'Chinese', 'coolies', 'human', 'beings', 'rather', 'latter-day', 'slaves', 'helping', 'good-natured', 'friend', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'realize', 'romance', 'abused', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'clashes', 'misdirected', 'often', 'selfish', 'sensibilities', 'especially', 'prideful', 'immasculated', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'leading', 'series', 'tragedies', 'Holman', 'powerless', 'avert', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'films', 'range', 'brilliant', 'lackluster', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'giving', 'quot', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'quot', 'sense', 'David', 'Lean-esque', 'largesse', 'ever', 'losing', 'sight', 'characters', 'even', 'heat', 'battle', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'score', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'Even', 'film', 'plot', 'factions', 'Asian', 'country', 'opposing', 'foreign', 'attempts', 'control', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'allegory', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'quot', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'quot', 'never', 'Americans-good/Chinese-bad', 'melodrama', 'real', 'life', 'often', 'subtle', 'complex', 'exhilerating', 'tragic', 'haunting']",N/A

This is a character-driven action-drama, which Hollywood doesn't make many of any more, because people's attention-spans are shorter and longer films are more risky to make.  Also at the time studios could count on longer releases at their own theatres to earn back their investment, but that arrangement was broken up by anti-trust actions in the late 60's.Mcqueen's Holman was special. He cared enough about his job to oppose turning it over to the coolies, and then when that became impossible, he respected them enough to take one as an engineering pupil, instead of treating them as virtual slaves. He seemed singularly virtuous, if a little lost and hermetic about his life choices.The film shows a forgotten moment in US history when we were maintaining an international colonial presence in China, then a collapsed Feudal state at the end of long dynasty.  But we had no business there as overlords, and China was and is far too large to accept outside control permenantly.  Once they'd absorbed enough western technology the end was inevitable. Over the course of the film the natives go from polite-but-unfriendly and toothless, to profoundly hostile and murderous, and the movie doesn't cast negative judgement on this - it respects the complexity of the situation and sees it as a natural, historic event.This came out at a time when we were fighting to maintain a questionable presence in IndoChina (Vietnam).. This was either intentionally meant to comment on this, or was simply interpreted as such by the audience of the time.  The sad ending was a moment of deep, existential sadness, but there was a reality there.

573049,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B000059HAF,T O'Brien,"[1, 2]","The Sand Pebbles is a huge epic of a movie detailing a time in U.S. history that most people prefer to forget.  The movie tells the story of the San Pablo, a US gunboat, and its new engineer, Jake Holman.  Upon his arrival, Holman upsets the living and working system the crew has with their Chinese coolies.  This is just the first of many problems that fall upon the San Pablo.  Along the way, the crew must remain their presence as China goes through their revolution.  Just the presence of the US gunboat upsets the people.  The action scenes, especially the battle with the barricade of junks and the gunbattle in the courtyard are startling and graphic, but very effective.  There are plenty of great scenes, especially those between Holman and his new Chinese coolie, Po Han.  Their scenes together are great to watch as Holman tries to teach him about how the engine works.  This is a great movie that takes its time to get going, but once it does it never slows down.Steve McQueen fully deserved his nomination for Best Actor for his performance as Jake Holman.  He became famous for playing the brooding loner, and this performance is no different.  Richard Attenborough is also very good as one of Jake's few allies on the ship, Frenchy Burgoyne.  Richard Crenna is excellent as the captain of the San Pablo who refuses to question their orders, no matter how ridiculous they may seem.  Candice Bergen is very good in one of her first roles as a missionary working with the Chinese people who befriends Jake.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, theatrical trailers, radio documentaries and spots, and commentary by the director.

573051,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000059HAF,Trevor Willsmer,"[9, 9]","The Sand Pebbles, Robert Wise's epic tale of gunboat diplomacy in the turbulent China of the mid-Twenties is hugely ambitious and hugely expensive, yet, as with the best of his work, the focus is firmly on people, the momentous political events kept in the background until their consequences begin to overwhelm the principals. Even then, they are only drawn out of the small worlds they create for themselves (for Steve McQueen his engine room, for Candice Bergen her teaching in a remote mission) for purely personal reasons.More than any epic of the Sixties, The Sand Pebbles seems to draw heavily on the chaos and the confusion of the then ongoing Vietnam War, so it's a real surprise that Wise seemed genuinely unaware of any parallels. Yet, perhaps because of history's tendency to repeat itself, they're all too apparent in the finished film. The enemy is unclear: one minute it is the communists who are trying to incite an incident, the next Chang Kai Shek's Nationalists (although filmed in Taiwan with his approval, it is surprisingly critical of his actions). The only constant is ""Yankee go home.""McQueen's engineer Holman is pointedly referred to as a symbol of his country by his ineffectual commanding officer, but what kind? He holds no opinions, preferring to put his faith in machinery rather than people or politics, yet his mere presence is divisive. Even his own countrymen and crewmates turn against him and join in with their nominal enemies in an angry demonstration against his alleged crimes. While he projects the image of the simple, honest and misunderstand ordinary man suffering a situation not of his making that America's old guard wanted to believe of their boys in Asia, he ultimately declares his independence from a fight he cannot understand (""I ain't got no more enemies"") and is only drawn back from desertion to save the woman he loves but doesn't quite understand.The contradictory and opposed feelings of the folks at home are made clear from the opening debate on whether China can be trusted with its own destiny to Larry Gates' missionary renouncing his own nationality as he prays for a Chinese victory: he may stop short of burning the flag, but he has no qualms about cursing it (""Damn your flag! Damn all flags!"").Rather than setpiece battles (although it has a doozey of one in the last act), it is a film of escalating incidents, increasingly violent and all rendered impossible to deal with by the demands of diplomacy and provoking an endless source of black propaganda. Even when the American flag is obscured by a thick cloud of opium smoke emerging from the San Pablo's smokestack, the Americans remain innocent in principle but lose the moral high ground as they either exploit the locals for their own comfort or end up fighting among themselves.Even the Captain's attitude is confused. He talks of duty, yet runs a slack ship for fear of giving the discontented crew an excuse for mutiny, even turning a literal blind eye to one crewmember's desertion. When it matters most, his crew openly disobey him, provoking him to consider suicide before defying orders and endangering his crew in several efforts to ""die clean."" The film itself has been accused of being equally confused, but it simply portrays the confusion, making no judgements. No dogma triumphs in this film, no side wins: all that is left are people forced into dealing with situations that will not profit them.Robert Anderson's script manages to give nearly all of the characters a story of their own that are integrated into the main fabric of the plot while Wise isn't afraid to take the time each scene needs rather than rushing it, and that's repaid with uniformly excellent performances. The Oscar-nominated McQueen is in complete harmony with his role and shows remarkable sensitivity in his final scene with Marayat Andriane, whose romantic subplot with a genuinely affecting Richard Attenborough overshadows McQueen's uneasy nearly-romance with a very sweet and very young Candice Bergen. Richard Crenna is outstanding as the Captain driven to thoughts of suicide and equally suicidal heroism, with good support from Mako and a mug's gallery including Simon Oakland and Joe Turkel below decks.A replacement for Alex North, who bowed out over concerns with the film's violence, Jerry Goldsmith's score (treated to an isolated score track with brief interview extracts wit the man himself) is one of his very best. From the tense and brooding main title over the strikingly simple design of a sampan dwarfing the gunboat to the hauntingly unresolved love theme he never overplays his hand or overdoes the Oriental flavor or the big, epic cues: they're there when needed, but all the more effective for not swamping the picture. Kudos too to Boris Leven's production design and Joseph McDonald's cinematography which, with its good use of color and location, makes 35mm look like 70mm.In addition to a plethora of special features, Fox's new 2-disc Region 1 NTSC also finally restores the original 196-minute roadshow version, although sadly the source print has faded quite badly, so you're left with a choice of a beautiful transfer of the 182-minute general release version or a rather soft transfer of the uncut version. It has to be said that both cuts work equally well, with little of substance cut. Yet while the cuts are sensitively made and the shorter version adheres to the old editor's maxim that ""if it wasn't there would you know it was missing?,"" for anyone who likes the film they'll be a welcome addition. For those interested, the major restorations to the roadshow version are:- Before the first repel boarders drill there is a brief scene with the tailor coolie measuring Holman for a new uniform on deck.- A brief scene of local bandits firing on the San Pablo from the shore as the gunboat patrols the river.- After the accident with the chief engine room coolie, the scene continues to show the repair of the engine.- After the crew start taking bets on the fight between Po-Han and Stawski, there is a brief scene between Holman and Frenchie.- Before Jake shows Shirley around Changsha, there is a brief sequence where she explains why no priests will marry Frenchie and Mailly; afterwards there is a conversation between the two in a restaurant.- Captain Collins' conversation with Ensign Bordelles after they see the men fighting on deck is much longer, with Collins explaining that he has authority only as long as he does not exercise it.- The battle scene at the river boom is much longer, with the San Pablo taking a direct hit and having to pull out of the fight while the crew put out a fire on deck.Some other scenes are slightly extended with additional shots or dialogue; the roadshow version also has brief intermission scoring not on the general release version. Sadly, the exit music is not included on the DVD for some reason.",5,"""I ain't got no more enemies.""",1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,6898,"['Sand', 'Pebbles', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'epic', 'tale',
