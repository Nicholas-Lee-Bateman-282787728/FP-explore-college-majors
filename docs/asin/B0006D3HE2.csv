865278,A1RXXFG6310KZF,B0006D3HE2,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","I think that in this genre, ForeverKnight, a series like this is greatly missed.  I still cannot get the very last scene from the last show out of my mind when there they are, the 2 vamps.  On one side the Cop, and the other the Renegade---yet I think LaCroix evolved a bit more towards a more ""understanding and genuine side"" without losing the ""horrific"".  He became more removed from the persona as was in the first series alone.  And there among them stands Natalie.  I truly had a personal crush for this character.  She played that forensic scientist better than anyone I have ever seen on TV short of ""Quincy"".  Without Natalie there would be no possible scenes of devotion for Nick and possible redemption which he so thrived for, that there was from her.  Once I wrote her, Catherine Disher who played Natalie, a letter congratulating her for the part in which she portrayed in with so much enthusiasm.  I don't know if she ever got it, but when her character came on the scene, you would quickly notice that when she was good, she was GREAT!!  It is a great shame they took it off the air after just 3 seasons, I believe it was 3.  I have both of the series and am awaiting most ""humbly"" for the final 3rd.  But to all the actors and their characters.....THANK YOU SO MUCH!!  You gave to this supernatural program the life-like qualities of beauty and resilience it would never have otherwise been given by anyone.  The actors, who were all chosen for their parts, were all so well connected that I think the directors ought to get great accolades for that alone.  You all gave it romance and horror.  But most of all, you gave us a series with the possibilities of endless ""redemption"" that I have yet to witness in shows today.  Catherine.... Thank you for your character!  You played Natalie so poignantly well with great Talent, Devotion, Mystery, Unpredictability, and clarity to the character that it's too bad you didn't get exactly what you wanted in that last scene playing ""Natalie"", but then again......the key word is....exact--ly.  :)",5,To Catherine and The Whole Cast --- Thank you !!!!,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,2057,"['think', 'genre', 'ForeverKnight', 'series', 'greatly', 'missed', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'last', 'show', 'mind', 'when', 'are', '2', 'vamps', 'one', 'side', 'Cop', 'other', 'Renegade', '-yet', 'think', 'LaCroix', 'evolved', 'bit', 'more', 'towards', 'more', 'understanding', 'genuine', 'side', 'losing', 'horrific', 'became', 'more', 'removed', 'persona', 'was', 'first', 'series', 'alone', 'Natalie', 'truly', 'had', 'personal', 'crush', 'character', 'played', 'forensic', 'scientist', 'better', 'anyone', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'short', 'Quincy', 'Natalie', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'scenes', 'devotion', 'Nick', 'possible', 'redemption', 'so', 'thrived', 'was', 'wrote', 'Catherine', 'Disher', 'who', 'played', 'Natalie', 'letter', 'congratulating', 'part', 'portrayed', 'so', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ever', 'got', 'when', 'character', 'came', 'scene', 'would', 'quickly', 'notice', 'when', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'GREAT', 'great', 'shame', 'took', 'off', 'air', 'just', '3', 'seasons', 'believe', 'was', '3', 'have', 'series', 'am', 'awaiting', 'most', 'humbly', 'final', '3rd', 'actors', 'characters', '..THANK', 'YOU', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'gave', 'supernatural', 'program', 'life-like', 'qualities', 'beauty', 'resilience', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'given', 'anyone', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'chosen', 'parts', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'connected', 'think', 'directors', 'ought', 'get', 'great', 'accolades', 'alone', 'gave', 'romance', 'horror', 'most', 'gave', 'series', 'possibilities', 'endless', 'redemption', 'have', 'yet', 'witness', 'shows', 'today', 'Catherine', 'Thank', 'character', 'played', 'Natalie', 'so', 'poignantly', 'well', 'great', 'Talent', 'Devotion', 'Mystery', 'Unpredictability', 'clarity', 'character', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'last', 'scene', 'playing', 'Natalie', 'then', 'again', 'key', 'word', '.exact', 'ly']",N/A

The plots are excellent and funny, as well as entertaining, and the actors were engaging. I was dying to see more, so I purchased season 2.What a disspointment! Nick and Schanke are now at a different precinct, with a new captain and some really interesting new cases. Their new captain, is unfriendly at first, but as a viewer, you quickly warm up to her. At first I was depressed, but as I watched more episodes, I was glad to get a deeper look into Nick's past as a vampire, his future and his eternal strugle to regain his mortality.We also get to see more about Lacroix and Jeanette's past, which is why I gave this DVD 4 stars and not less.HOWEVER: there is one episode that made me VERY upset and nearly kick the TV in. (not really a spoiler, as its in the episode description) Nick finds a temporary cure to vampirism. We see Nick OUT in SUNLIGHT, like a normal guy. It took away the edge that Nick has as a vampire, and takes away one of the main reasons I enjoyed the series so much.Other than that, some of the episodes are fabulous, while others are horrid. To put a percentage on it, I would say about 60/40. 60% being great, while the other 40% are terrible.I did however, enjoy the commentary by the actors and the behind the scenes look at Forever Knight. I am looking foreward to buying season 3 when it comes out, but I hope they use better flying effects in this one, and don't just jiggle the camera as the actor ""leaps"" into the scene.",4,Nick Knight returns in Season 2 without new effects,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,1610,"['When', 'purchased', 'season', '1', 'was', 'thrilled', 'bad', 'flying', 'effects', 'cool', 'aerial', 'views', 'Fly', 'cam', 'small', 'helicopter', 'camera', 'attatched', 'plots', 'are', 'excellent', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'actors', 'were', 'engaging', 'was', 'dying', 'see', 'more', 'purchased', 'season', '2.What', 'disspointment', 'Nick', 'Schanke', 'are', 'now', 'different', 'precinct', 'new', 'captain', 'really', 'interesting', 'new', 'cases', 'new', 'captain', 'unfriendly', 'first', 'viewer', 'quickly', 'warm', 'up', 'first', 'was', 'depressed', 'watched', 'more', 'episodes', 'was', 'glad', 'get', 'deeper', 'look', 'Nick', 'past', 'vampire', 'future', 'eternal', 'strugle', 'regain', 'mortality.We', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Lacroix', 'Jeanette', 'past', 'why', 'gave', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'less.HOWEVER', 'one', 'episode', 'made', 'VERY', 'upset', 'nearly', 'kick', 'TV', 'not', 'really', 'spoiler', 'episode', 'description', 'Nick', 'temporary', 'cure', 'vampirism', 'see', 'Nick', 'OUT', 'SUNLIGHT', 'normal', 'guy', 'took', 'away', 'edge', 'Nick', 'vampire', 'away', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'much.Other', 'episodes', 'are', 'fabulous', 'others', 'are', 'horrid', 'put', 'percentage', 'would', 'say', '60/40', '60', '%', 'being', 'great', 'other', '40', '%', 'are', 'terrible.I', 'did', 'however', 'enjoy', 'commentary', 'actors', 'scenes', 'look', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'am', 'looking', 'foreward', 'buying', 'season', '3', 'when', 'out', 'hope', 'use', 'better', 'flying', 'effects', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'jiggle', 'camera', 'actor', 'leaps', 'scene']",N/A

865282,A2XXV9HF169LCF,B0006D3HE2,A. Trotter,"[35, 38]","Season 2 is a little more sophisticated, a little better directed than season 1. In it you see Nick begin to slide a little back into his old life, just a little, just enough to make you question if his redemption is, in the end, entirely possible despite all his efforts. They've done away with the repeated bits of filler scene and added more flashbacks, which is a good thing.A big complaint of my husband's is that the show is inherently cheesy. The costumes, the acting, the whole thing is done slightly camp, slightly overblown, a little dramatic. But in this it reminds me of traditional theater, and I like it. That element isn't quite as aparent in this season though. What is aparent are that this show holds the begining of a lot of actors and actresses that went on to bigger and better things - looks for some of the main actors from Andromeda and someone in particular from Stargate, just for a couple of names.So... all I'm waiting for is season three.

865286,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0006D3HE2,D. S. Thurlow,"[2, 2]","In its second season, ""Forever Knight"" hits its stride as a cult classic TV program.  Geraint Wyn Davies is back as Nick Knight, 13th century vampire and 20th century Toronto night shift homicide cop.  Catherine Disher as Nick's confidant Natalie and John Kapelos as Nick's partner Schanke also return.  Natsuko Ohama joins the cast as the new precinct captain.Nick's vampire mentor LeCroix, played by Nigel Bennett, plays a much bigger role in season two.  Seen only in flashbacks until the very end of season one, Lecroix is now alive and well and living in Toronto, exploring a complex relationship with Nick in which he is sometimes a concerned parent and sometimes a vengeful opponent. We are also allowed to see the full extent of Jeanette's long, caring, and sometimes complicated relationship with Nick as someone who shares LeCroix as a mentor.In season two, Nick's long past continues to intersect with his present, in which he solves crimes while seeking a means to become human again.  In one particularly outstanding episode, Natalie identifies a medicine that allows Nick to walk in the sun again, only to discover that the medicine has a wildly addictive and personality distorting effect like heroin.  In another well-done episode, Schanke at long last begins to wonder about the strange hours and abilities of his partner, leading him eventually to a fateful but well-played encounter with LeCroix. In a third episode, we find out why Nick has been reluctant to pursue his relationship with Natalie to its seemingly logical conclusion.The strength of the series continues to be its story-telling ability.  Actions relentlessly have consequences; even good deeds can have unintended effects.  Each episode is built around a topical crime but designed to allow the characters to explore the morality of their own actions as well as the perpetrator's.  Fred Molle's haunting background music continues to add depth to the show.This series is highly recommended to fans of its all-too-brief runs on Canadian and US television.  The special features include a retrospective on the show and a question and answer session for fans.

The hero - played by Geraint Wyn Davies - is Nicholas Knight, a Toronto homicide cop who is also a vampire who was ""brought across 800 years ago and wants to atone for his sins, to be mortal again"".This was/is an excellent series that was/is terribly underated.  The writing was clever, the acting superb and although it was done on a tight budget the limitations did not detract from the show.Most of the cast from the first season has returned for this one, his vampire family, Jeanette and Lacroix (Deborah Duchene and Nigel Bennett), his partner Schanke (John Kapelos) and confidante Natalie (Catherine Disher).  The most notable exception is the police captain, played by Gary Farmer in season one and Natsuko Ohama in this season.  The show has seemed to find its stride in this season, the basic premise and relationship foundations have already been made which, in my opinion, makes the second season  better than the first.  Several of the episodes are paraticularly good - 'Close Call' - Schanke begins to catch on that something is different about Nick; 'Curiouser and Curiouser' - Nick falls down the rabbit hole; 'Baby, Baby' - a misunderstanding from Nick's past returns; 'A More Permanent Hell' - the end of the world appears imminent and Lacroix's past is revealed and 'Be My Valentine' - a feast for Nick and Natalie fans.This set offers much more in extras than the previous set, there are commentaries from Nigel Bennett ('Curiouser and Curiouser' and 'A More Permanent Hell') and from creator James Parriott and Geraint Wyn Davies ('Blood Money' and 'Killer Instinct').  In addition there are interviews with Parriott and Wyn Davies on the series in general.The only questions that remain are: When do we get Season 3 and any chance of a movie and/or a Season 4?",5,A vast improvement on the previous DVD set,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,1881,"['second', 'season', 'FOREVER', 'KNIGHT', 'Canadian', 'series', 'was', 'produced', 'mid', '90', 'hero', 'played', 'Geraint', 'Wyn', 'Davies', 'Nicholas', 'Knight', 'Toronto', 'homicide', 'cop', 'who', 'also', 'vampire', 'who', 'was', 'brought', '800', 'years', 'ago', 'atone', 'sins', 'be', 'mortal', 'again', '.This', 'was/is', 'excellent', 'series', 'terribly', 'underated', 'writing', 'was', 'clever', 'acting', 'superb', 'was', 'done', 'tight', 'budget', 'limitations', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'show.Most', 'cast', 'first', 'season', 'returned', 'one', 'vampire', 'family', 'Jeanette', 'Lacroix', 'Deborah', 'Duchene', 'Nigel', 'Bennett', 'partner', 'Schanke', 'John', 'Kapelos', 'confidante', 'Natalie', 'Catherine', 'Disher', 'most', 'notable', 'exception', 'police', 'captain', 'played', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'season', 'one', 'Natsuko', 'Ohama', 'season', 'show', 'seemed', 'find', 'stride', 'season', 'basic', 'premise', 'relationship', 'foundations', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'made', 'opinion', 'second', 'season', 'better', 'first', 'Several', 'episodes', 'are', 'paraticularly', 'good', ""'Close"", 'Call', 'Schanke', 'catch', 'something', 'different', 'Nick', ""'Curiouser"", 'Curiouser', 'Nick', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'Baby', 'misunderstanding', 'Nick', 'past', 'returns', 'More', 'Permanent', 'Hell', 'end', 'world', 'imminent', 'Lacroix', 'past', 'revealed', 'My', 'Valentine', 'feast', 'Nick', 'Natalie', 'fans.This', 'set', 'offers', 'much', 'more', 'extras', 'previous', 'set', 'are', 'commentaries', 'Nigel', 'Bennett', ""'Curiouser"", 'Curiouser', 'A', 'More', 'Permanent', 'Hell', 'creator', 'James', 'Parriott', 'Geraint', 'Wyn', 'Davies', 'Money', ""'Killer"", 'Instinct', 'addition', 'are', 'interviews', 'Parriott', 'Wyn', 'Davies', 'series', 'general.The', 'only', 'questions', 'remain', 'are', 'When', 'do', 'get', 'Season', '3', 'chance', 'movie', 'and/or', 'Season', '4']",N/A

865298,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0006D3HE2,Mitch Weaver,"[36, 37]","Nick Knight ( Geraint Wyn Davies) is a vampire who has lived for almost 800 years. However, he has always wished that he could become mortal again. To repay his debt to society, he works as a homicide detective for the Toronto Metropolitan Police. While he secretly uses his vampire abilities to solve the city's most difficult cases with his smart-mouthed and witty partner Don Schanke ( John Kapelos), he attempts to find a cure for his case of vampirism with his best friend and fellow medical pathologist Natalie Lambert (Catherine Disher).I have been a fan of the vampire genre my whole life. There have been many films and television shows that have focused on that very subject. However, Forever Knight is one of the best overall that I have ever seen. All I can say is that I am extremely excited about the release of season two on DVD. The first season DVD set was not very well put together in my opinion. But it looks like the powers that be are rectifying their mistakes. We get actual extras this time and at a much better price than before. However, for me in this case, the lower price and fantastic extras that are being offered, are just icing on the cake. I want the set mainly for the episodes themselves. The first season of Forever Knight was excellent. But the second season is my favorite one of the whole show. After the first episode, Lacroix was only shown via flashbacks for the entire first season. We finally get to see Nick's vampire mentor and sire Lacroix return and do more than just connect us to Nick's past. The second season really lets Nigel Bennet show us why he is the most talented actor on the show. He plays Lacroix perfectly throughout the season. Secondly, the plot lines in season two are considerably better than the first season as well. A great example of this, is the episode ""Close Call"" in which Schanke gets closer to the truth about Nick.Overall I could not be happier with the second season set they have put together. With a fantastic season and great extras at a more afforable price, I consider this set a must own for any fan of the vampire genre.A solid 5 stars...",5,"Great season, actual extras, and more afforable!!",1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,2124,"['Nick', 'Knight', 'Geraint', 'Wyn', 'Davies', 'vampire', 'who', 'lived', 'almost', '800', 'years', 'However', 'always', 'wished', 'could', 'become', 'mortal', 'again', 'repay', 'debt', 'society', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Toronto', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'secretly', 'vampire', 'abilities', 'solve', 'city', 'most', 'difficult', 'cases', 'smart-mouthed', 'witty', 'partner', 'Don', 'Schanke', 'John', 'Kapelos', 'find', 'cure', 'case', 'vampirism', 'best', 'friend', 'fellow', 'medical', 'pathologist', 'Natalie', 'Lambert', 'Catherine', 'Disher', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'vampire', 'genre', 'whole', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'films', 'television', 'shows', 'have', 'focused', 'very', 'subject', 'However', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'one', 'best', 'overall', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'extremely', 'excited', 'release', 'season', 'two', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'opinion', 'powers', 'be', 'are', 'rectifying', 'mistakes', 'get', 'actual', 'extras', 'time', 'much', 'better', 'price', 'However', 'case', 'lower', 'price', 'fantastic', 'extras', 'are', 'being', 'offered', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'want', 'set', 'mainly', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'was', 'excellent', 'second', 'season', 'favorite', 'one', 'whole', 'show', 'first', 'episode', 'Lacroix', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'flashbacks', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Nick', 'vampire', 'mentor', 'sire', 'Lacroix', 'return', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'connect', 'Nick', 'past', 'second', 'season', 'really', 'Nigel', 'Bennet', 'show', 'why', 'most', 'talented', 'actor', 'show', 'Lacroix', 'perfectly', 'season', 'Secondly', 'plot', 'lines', 'season', 'two', 'are', 'considerably', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'example', 'episode', 'Close', 'Call', 'Schanke', 'closer', 'truth', 'Nick.Overall', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'happier', 'second', 'season', 'set', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'fantastic', 'season', 'great', 'extras', 'more', 'afforable', 'price', 'consider', 'set', 'must', 'own', 'fan', 'vampire', 'genre.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",N/A

865303,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0006D3HE2,Tom Benton,"[5, 5]","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN*Unspectacular ratings led to the cancellation of FOREVER KNIGHT after its first season in 1993.  At that point the show had already gathered a large cult following, and that following was outraged.  Thankfully, they vented their frustration through extensive campaigning to get the show back on the air, and for one of the few times in television history, it worked.  One year after its untimely demise, FOREVER KNIGHT returned to television, and the world is all the better for it.  The show's second season is widely regarded as the series' best, due to further character development, intriguing plotlines, and a wealth of great episodes (26, to be exact; the first season had 22).Season two got off to a fantastic start with the turbulent premiere, ""Killer Instinct"".  The previous season's finale, ""Love You to Death"", had closed with a brief glimpse of LaCroix (Nigel Bennett), back from the ""dead"" to torment vampire cop Nick Knight (Geraint Wyn Davies) in the present.  In ""Killer Instinct"", Nick must deal not only with the return of LaCroix, but with an investigation from Internal Affairs as well - an investigation that threatens to reveal Nick's secret to the world.  ""Stranger Than Fiction"" involves an Anne Rice-style horror author being protected by the police - and whom Nick is developing an attraction to.  ""Forward Into The Past"" is a sweet episode, in which Nick must save a woman whom he befriended forty years ago.  Nigel Bennett shines in ""Father's Day"".  Jack The Ripper comes to modern-day Toronto in ""Bad Blood"" (it turns out that he was one of LaCroix's nastier creations ... !)  There are some excellent flashbacks in ""Can't Run, Can't Hide"", where Nick recalls his time spent feeding off corpses of the slain during the Vietnam Conflict.  ""Amateur Night"" is one of the show's sillier episodes, as Nick and Schanke (John Kapelos) try to protect a famous female action star.  The inevitable ""diplomatic immunity"" episode comes in the form of ""Beyond the Law"".  Natalie (Catherine Disher) finds a cure for Nick's vampirism in ""The Fix"", while Nick examines his feelings for her in ""Be My Valentine"" (that episode also gives us a fascinating look at one of LaCroix's past romances).  HIGHLANDER writer Gillian Horvath writes ""Queen of Harps"", which turns out to be an all-around wonderful episode which includes flashbacks to Nick's pre-vampire days.  ""A More Permanent Hell"" is one of the series' best episodes, due largely to the brilliant flashbacks to LaCroix's pre-vampire days.  That episode also introduces LaCroix's eerie daughter, Divia (Kathryn Long), who would appear once more in the third season.  ""Curioser & Curioser"" is a magnificent episode, and in my opinion the highlight of season two.  In the episode, Nick blames himself for the death of humans at the Raven; as his guilt consumes him, it begins distorting his reality.  (The ending of that episode is to die for.)  There are some wonderful scenes in ""Near Death"" as well, where we learn that Nick hasn't quite redeemed himself ... yet.  ""Baby Baby"" presents an interesting theory about vampires becoming human, and giving birth (a theory further explored in the third season).  ""Close Call"" is one of the weaker episodes.  The plot, involving Schanke nearly discovering Nick's secret, is great, but the execution is not: most of the episode is made up of lengthy flashbacks to previous episodes.  Finally, the season concludes with ""Crazy Love"".  While that episode doesn't give us a cliffhanger as grand as the one provided by season one, it does introduce the eerie and far more realistic eye effects that would be used for vampires through the rest of the show, as well as more realistic landing effects.As this season focuses more on the characters than did the previous season, one can't help but focus more on the actors as well.  Close scrutiny reveals nothing but excellent acting all around.  Geraint Wyn Davies is terrific.  His on-screen chemistry both with confidante (and lover?) Natalie/Catherine Disher and bumbling but lovable partner Schanke/John Kapelos is completely believable, as is his contempt for his former master LaCroix/Nigel Bennett.  Bennett truly steals the show.  Yes, LaCroix is evil, but Bennett's performance and delivery of LaCroix's cynical witticisms is simply irresistible.  Also great in this season is the charming Deborah Duchene; it's always a delight when Janette shows up.  Gary Farmer, who played the chief of police in the first season, is replaced by Natsuko Ohama.  Ohama's chief is very different from Farmer's, and though I was a little thrown off by her arrival at the start of the season, I had warmed up to her by its finish.  This season was also John Kapelos' last on the show before his character's untimely demise in the opening of season three.  Ironically, in Schanke's final scene, he declares, ""That's it.  It's over.  I am out of here.  The fat lady has sung!""There's more great costumes, dark lighting, and charmingly claustrophobic sets in this season, not to mention some of Fred Mollin's finest music.  The writing never falters and the directing, as well as the show itself, is immensely stylish.  FOREVER KNIGHT has an atmosphere and style completely its own; no doubt that was a major part in amassing the show's huge fan base.  Those who enjoyed season one will love the second season; it's arguably better than the first.  All in all, an excellent second season, and I can't wait to watch season three.",5,A superior second season of an immensely stylish series,1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,5497,"['*POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS',
