I was concerned about video-quality on a Hi-Definition set yet once I started the first DVD I was relieved. This set would probably be a great homeschooling tool for parents who want to introduce their kids to the fundamentals of God's Law.The downside is the shortness of the episodes. All 5 (a little over 20 minutes each) should have easily fit on one single DVD instead of 5. But then the price would have been lower and what's good for the consumer may not be good for the studio.,5,Good Quality entertainment,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,604,"['knew', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'reading', 'comments', 'Josh', 'McDowell', 'other', 'famous', 'Christian', 'writers', 'was', 'concerned', 'video-quality', 'Hi-Definition', 'set', 'yet', 'once', 'started', 'first', 'DVD', 'was', 'relieved', 'set', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'great', 'homeschooling', 'tool', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'introduce', 'kids', 'fundamentals', 'God', 'Law.The', 'downside', 'shortness', 'episodes', '5', 'little', '20', 'minutes', 'should', 'have', 'easily', 'fit', 'one', 'single', 'DVD', 'instead', '5', 'then', 'price', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lower', 'what', 'good', 'consumer', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'studio']",N/A
