326941,AWO0Q404FVX04,6302662753,"C. Fields ""Making your brain hurt since 2005.""","[0, 0]","I heard many a good review on this and I'm glad I got it as a rental instead of buying it. I really don't give a care about spoiling this film for anyone because there's nothing good in it to &#34;spoil&#34;. The movie is an inarticulate mess and an insult to its audience.The film is by legendary animator Ralph Bakshi but unfortunately this one falls flat on its face. Brad Pitt's character begins as a young PTSD suffering WWII veteran who gets into a motorcycle accident that kills his mother. Pitt is sucked into the &#34;Cool World&#34; and becomes a private detective in an animated world where he apparently doesn't age. Fast forward to 1992 and... well the movie's wheels just continue to come off and it flys apart more and more as the film just drags on and on and on.The only memorable thing about this film is its total disregard for the viewer's intelligence, horrifying stupidity of the plot, and beyond low budget set and prop designs for all the live action scenes. All the animated scenes are well drawn, although the characters are vile in about every respect. It seems like Bakshi was going for something in the vein of &#34;what do toons do when they can't have sex and can't die?&#34; The result is &#34;Cool World&#34;. Where the only constant in this swiss cheese plot is that the toons do nothing but bash on each other for enjoyment it what look like strip-clubs. Also, apparently humans, or &#34;noids&#34;, aren't supposed to have sex with &#34;doodles&#34;, or cartoon characters. This would, in any other film idea, ratchet the rating up to an R but the creators kept the PG-13 rating and just cut out any nudity or sex, even though it was supposed to be the central them of the paper-thin plot of a toon &#34;Holli Wood&#34; trying to have sex with her creator to become human, that way she can access the human world and retrieve some artifact atop a casino in Las Vegas. The artifact collapses the barriers between both worlds... Well, you've probably seen this plot in a dozen other, and better made, films.The strikingly awful part of this is the relationship between Pitt's character and an animated girl from the &#34;Cool World&#34;. They have a relationship but can't have sex, which causes obvious issues in the relationship. Pitt's character is killed by Holli while she's in cartoon form by throwing him off the top of the casino. Pitt's animated partner drags him back to the &#34;Cool World&#34; to his girlfriend where it's suddenly (and inexplicably) revealed that killing a human as a toon results in that human coming back to life as a toon.  Pitt comes back as some 1940's drawing character and thus the movie ends as Holli and her creator (now animated as a big and utterly annoying stereotype of a super-hero) stuck in an alternate universe with Holli griping about her life and her creator talking about how they're going to be married and spend the rest of their lives together. It's a total slap in the face and an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.Some &#34;cult films&#34; are that way for a reason. There's a small and often incredibly devout following but make no mistake, this film is by no means a &#34;Heavy Metal&#34; and shouldn't even be considered in the same vein of the genre.Don't bother with it.

On the positive side, Holly Would is way &quot;cartoon sexier&quot; than Jessica Rabbit (as is  Brad Pitt's cartoon girlfriend), and it's great seeing Kim Basinger squirm  around like she's in heat, but other than that, there's not a whole lot in  COOL WORLD to get excited about. After 80 or so years of rich animation  history, you'd think this movie would be loaded with in-jokes and  references, but instead the ancillary characters do little more than fill  the scene with your very basic cartoon gags. And the more surreal, black  and white animation looks amatuerish and out of place. The pivotal moment  of the film occurs when a real life Gabriel Byrne and Holly Would do the  nasty, changing her into a human. Given Bakshi's graphic past, you'd think  this scene would be a little more &quot;climactic,&quot; but in truth, I  didn't realize it was actually happening until it was over. It is totally  uninspired (both parties are fully dressed), and given the way Holly Would  looked, that's a damn shame. The review on the box calls this a  &quot;darker, more extreme WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?&quot;, but that's being  nice. It's more like a WFRR with low production value, crappy acting,  cheaper animation, inferior story, and lacking cartoon charm. COOL WORLD is  too crude for children, and too boring for adults.

326960,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6302662753,JRP,"[0, 3]","Here I am coming with you with another 20 years ago review this is 20 years ago Cool World. You know I wasn't looking forward to watching this due to a lot of the bad things I've heard I don't care for this movie but I won't rant on it. There are things that I do like about it I don't think it deserves a 3 percent on Rotten Tomatoes either I've seen worse than Cool World. I really can't sit here & tear this movie apart. Cause I like that it went for an older audience. It was made on a budget of $28 million only made $14 million so it was a bomb. It was directed by Ralph Bakshi this was the only movie of note that I have seen of his. It stars Brad Pitt as Frank Harris, Gaberial Byrne Jack Debbs & Kim Basinger as Holli Would. The story is you start off with in 1945 this guy Frank Harris he & his mother were killed in a motorcycle wreck Frank is transported to The Cool World you then introcduced to this cartoon character Dr Whiskers who has created this spike that brought Frank there so Dr Whiskers goes into ""the real world"" & Frank stays in The Cool World. Then it's 47 years later you're then introduced to Jack Deebs who makes these comics books  called Cool World he is in prison for killing a man who he caught sleeping with his wife. On the night before his release he is transported to The  Cool World where he sees 1 of his characters Holli Would dancing at this club. So anyway he goes back to ""the real world goes home after his release where he goes back into The Cool World & from there it's pretty boring nothing happens except stuff falling on people & random violence. I'm not complaining about violence it's just stuff falling on cartoon characters all the time & nothing happens & it's kind of boring. I didn't laugh 1 time at the comedy elements when you have humor it is suppose to be funny. Frank who is now a detective is investigating Holli Would he tells Jack that that humans aren't allowed to have s  3  x with cartoons he tells him that the filling pen he has is wepon cause it can erase the doodles. Frank has this girlfriend that is a cartoon & he also has a partner named nails. You know this script was a mess nothing really happens like I said. Jack & Holli actually do it & it turns her human. An informant tells Nails about while Frank is spending time with his girlfirend Nails goes alone. Hollie uses her pen on Nails which erases him. Jack & Hollie go to ""the real world"" they go aroud Las Vegas they end up flickering between human & cartoon states. Then Holli tells Jack about ""The Spike Of Power"" Jack doesn't believe her so she literally kicks him out of the car. Meanwhile Frank arrives in ""the real world"" Frank attempts to arrest Jack & Gaberial Byrne's acting in this scene is laughable. Just the serious acting they put in this movie hurts it.  Jack tellls him what is going on y ou have this neighbor girl let them & for whatever reason they let her go with them. Frank tells Jack that the spike is real. So you have Holli go around this Casino looking for Vegas Vinnie you know what I was thinking of Vinnie Vegas 1 of Kevin Nash's earlier characters in WCW. Holli is thrown out of the casino for not spending any money Dr Whiskers returns & tells her not to get The Spike she takes the pen & pops him. Frank chases after Holli in The Casino while she is in doodle form she pushes Frank off the building. Hooli takes the spike where it opens up a portal from The Cool World it starts turning people into doodles. It turns Jack into a superhero doodle. Where he gets a hold of the spike & fights off several monster doodles he puts the spike in it's place the portal closes it turns everything back to normal Jack stays in The Cool World Franki becomes a doodle cause if a human is killed by a doodle they are brought back as a cartoon. I know I wasn't in depth with this review but there isn't much to say about it I like the look of the film I liked that it went for an older audience. But the humor didn't work it's boring in a lot of parts of the movie nothing happens & it reallly should've went all the way for an R rating. But like I said it's not as bad as I heard. Ralph Bakshi did what he could. Brad Pitt wasn't bad honestly I didn't care about him. Gaberial Byrne & Kim Basinger were far more interesting. If you like this movie that's fine. This is 1 of those movies that I would support a remake of it's not Robocop & Total Recall that don't need a remake there is nothing wrong with those movies.

Coming out so soon after &#34;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&#34; this movie had no excuse for being so poorly executed.However, like I said, the animation, considered on its own merits, is well-done.  It's colorful and vibrant and fascinating to look at, in a strange psychedelic way.  Plus, Holli Would is hot - and I must confess I have a &#34;thing&#34; for sexy cartoon babes, though that alone is scarcely enough to justify watching this movie.  Holli does not have any of the grace that makes a character like Jessica Rabbit appealing.  There's just something about this movie ... I don't currently own a copy, but I've seen it a few times and it's one of those that sticks in my mind, and I do plan to buy it on DVD when the price is right.I think this is more than a little sad, but &#34;Cool World&#34; is probably the most watchable, or should I say Conventionally Accessible of all of Ralph Bakshi's movies.  The rest of his output has not stood the test of time, from the execrable Lord of the Rings part I, to the incomprehensibly talky & scatterbrained Fritz the Cat, the too-painful-to-endure Coonskin, plus let's not forget the tediously slow (as well as crude-looking) Wizards.  This one is it; unless you count the New Adventures of Mighty Mouse (which had moments of genuine brilliance), &#34;Cool World&#34; stands shamefacedly as the capstone, the pinnacle, the most watchable relic of a career full of bad, woefully dated cartoons.

I watched it for the second time last week and there is something about this ""sleazy cousin of Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" as a previous reviewer put it that for some reason holds a bit of my interst. Cool World could probably be described as one of the not-so-great movies that features the interaction of cartoons and real people. Not only is the plot weak, it has a bit of a naughty side to it. Still, there is something about Cool World that make me want to possibly see it a third time. For one thing, Kim Basinger makes a sexy cartoon character. Another thing is that I have always favored and been fascinated by movies that put cartoons and real people together such as Bednobs and Broomsticks, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Space Jam just to name a few. However, Cool World is definately not a movie that I would go out and buy. So what I'm saying is that if Cool World comes on television I would suggest giving it a look but I wouldn't suggest spending money to rent it unless you just feel you have to see it. Of course, if you compare Cool World to Who Framed Roger Rabbit as many reviewers have done, you will be disappointed.

Since it&#8217;s a Bakshi film, you know it will have two things: cartoons and sex.2. In this case it&#8217;s about cartoons that have sex with humans.3. It turns out that our universe, the Real World, is right next to a cartoon universe, the Cool World. Over there, cartoons are called doodles and humans are called noids.4. Brad Pitt plays a WWII vet that randomly gets sucked into the Cool World and becomes a cop to stop noids and doodles from having sex.5. Kim Basinger plays a slutty doodle named Holly Would who wants to have sex with a noid. If she orgasms, she will turn real. No real reason is given for why. Hell, no real reason is given for anything in this movie.6. Bakshi originally wanted to make a horror movie about a guy that has sex with a cartoon, and makes a deformed baby that wants to kill him. But the movie studio secretly hired the guy that made the &#8220;Friday the 13th&#8221; series to rewrite the script. He took out the horror themes. Then the studio threatened to sue Bakshi if he didn&#8217;t make the movie anyway.7. Bakshi made the movie, but says it wasn&#8217;t worth it. And it&#8217;s easy to see why - the resulting movie is a mess. The story makes no sense. Characters just do things. It&#8217;s too silly to take it serious, but it&#8217;s too dark to be just fun.8. Visually, the movie is really interesting, though. The mood and setting of Cool World is dark and surreal. There are many animated sequences in the background of scenes that make references to other famous cartoons.9. Fans of Bakshi, or of fantastic themes in cinema will appreciate the movie. But the studio tried to make a popular hit by walking the thin line between being a kid&#8217;s movie and an adult movie; it failed at both.",3,"too juvenile for adults, too adult for kids.

326973,A33XZ94NI9WWGS,6302662753,Rachel,"[2, 2]","As a huge fan of this movie, I'll state my opinion right now, plain and simple: the things ""Cool World"" does well are fantastic, and the things it does badly are horrible.  The fact that one of those horribly-done things is its plot is certainly the reason it's gained status as a ""bad"" movie. But if you watch movies for more than plot, then that should not deter you from checking it out.PLOT:The story's setup is clever and intriguing; the problem is that it squanders its potential.As with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" ""Cool World"" deals with humans interacting with cartoon characters, the real world existing next to the cartoon one.  But whereas ""Roger Rabbit's"" Toon Town was a playful, childlike take on the idea, there is something deeply more psychological about Cool World.  It's hinted throughout the movie that this dark, twisted world is related to insanity; when one human character arrives, he is told, ""You've lost it man...that's why you're here!""I was on the edge of my seat whenever a new question was put forth about Cool World: Who or what created it?  Why does the human cartoonist think he created this world, only to learn its existed decades before he was born? How come the only two humans we see traveling to Cool World are people with such troubled pasts? Unfortunately, these questions are never answered. Just when the movie starts to get really interesting, when it feels like it's halfway over, a climactic battle is suddenly slapped on, some dues ex machinas thrown in, and POOF...it's over.  It was by no comparison the most frustrating end to a movie I'd ever seen.The only positive thing I can say about this movie's plot is that it's inspiring. If you like to come up with your own theories, and figuring out what a movie is really ""about,"" then ""Cool World"" may inspire you. I've had some fun with it myself, thinking up different theories to fill in the plot holes.  Hopefully, ""Cool World"" has been or will be an inspiration for creative writers in need of ideas for a twisted psychological story, who will actually use those ideas to their full potential.CHARACTERS:The human lead Jack Deebs (Gabriel Byrne) could have been interesting, if his sinister side had been better explored.  He is introduced as a famed cartoonist who wrote comics about the dark, twisted city ""Cool World,"" while serving prison time for murdering his wife's lover.  When brought to ""Cool World,"" Jack is excited, where a normal person would be terrified or disturbed. But by the time the climax begins, Jack is has been reduced to just another bland hero who has to save the day. Jack, like the movie's plot, is a wasted idea. As a result, he winds up one of the least interesting characters, which is unfortunate (but common) for a protagonist.The sex kitten Holi Would is popular among male viewers, but I personally find her disgusting. I have no problem with female characters being sexy, or even slutty; but Holi's sexuality is so over-the-top, it's just gross. She is literally a caricature of a stripper/prostitute, who's driven by sexual lust.Fortunately, the two secondary leads are much better. Detective Frank Harris (Brad Pitt) is sympathetic and heroic from the start. His personality and conflicts are also consistent throughout the movie.  His Doodle girlfriend Lonette is a ""sexy"" cartoon like Holi, but unlike Holi, Lonette's personality is likeable--lovable in fact--and her sexuality is contained within her romantic moments with Frank.  Frank and Lonette give the audience someone to root for.Many of the other characters are great as well, particularly Frank's adorable spider sidekick Nails. Unfortunately, several of the best characters are depressingly underused.  A purple gangster named Sparks is introduced as a sinister threat...only to be shoved into the background for the rest of the film.  The same fate befalls a bloodthirsty bunny that chases some of the protagonists for one scene.  Far too much screen time is given to a group of grotesque characters called the Gouns (a sort of posse for Holi Would). I'd gladly trade those putrid characters for a bigger role from Sparks, the evil bunny, or several of the other characters we meet.ATMOSPHERETen out of ten!I hardly know how to describe the atmosphere of ""Cool World."" It's by far one of the best surreal settings I've ever seen in a movie.  Cool World is like an intriguing nightmare that you want to explore, rather than wake up from.  So much can be said about the setting. It's unique, with the way it combines a cartoony ""Looney Tunes""-like style with a dark, creepy, macabre setting; the way the camera pans around and between the twisted skyscrapers really makes it seem like its own dimension; and the detail with which the buildings are drawn is astounding. I notice something new every time I watch a clip of this movie; a new face in the buildings, more strange characters, new details in the walls. The artistic work and surreal feeling of the are alone reason to watch this movie.MUSIC:Fantastic! (If you like jazz or techno.)The music contributes heavily to the atmosphere of ""Cool World."" Depending on the scene, it alternates between fast-paced techno music, mournful film-noir saxophones, and bouncy cartoonish tunes, all often with an eerie echo.  Kudos to Mark Isham, David Bowie, and everyone else who contributed to this awesome, otherworldly soundtrack.OVERALL:I cannot in full honesty say this movie is ""good."" But good god, I do love it.  I recommend ""Cool World"" to animation fans who want inspiration for their own art, as well as anyone who could use a dark, twisted version of Toon Town for escapism during a dull day.",4,"It's

The film started good at the begining, Frank Harris being sucked into the ""Cool World"" and eventually a detective there and that's were the qaulity ends. The film goes back and forth between the cartoonist Jack Deebs in the real world,who is given no detail, and the poorly animated and un-funny ""Cool World"".

This Roger Rabbit wannabee manages only to come up with the pellets and not the rabbit cashing in on the huge hit that came before it.  And if you think it isn't cashing in how bout the fact that the 'toons' are referred to as 'doodles' in this baby!!  But if you want to see Brad Pitt amble his way through an early part that he had no concept of how to play then this is the movie for you.  It has moments especially when Kim Basinger is on screen because she is a hoot throughout this movie.  It's very 80's and Gabriel Byrne rounds out the threesome with some kind of plot where he is an ex-con cartoonist who murdered his ex (and he's the good guy) .  Brad Pitt is some WWII vet who accidentally killed his mother riding a motorcycle the day he got back from the war when a drunk appears from nowhere and they hit him (the only decent scenes in the whole movie and they're the first five minutes).  Then he's drawn into the 'doodles' world in some kind of vortex created by a not so mad 'doodle' scientist who later exits to the human world and out of guilt and overall moroseness stays with the 'doodles' and becomes one of the world's cops.  Kim Basinger is a 'doodle' dame (believe me it fits) who noirishly wants more kicks out of life than Doodleville can provide and will do anything or anybody to get to the human world.  And she gets to be both doodle and human and sexy both ways.  And there you have the set up.  To tell you more would ruin it (now that's funny!).

326982,A2DXWPSRCS9ETF,6302662753,"sleeping sheepsnake ""Seth""","[3, 6]","Cool World is a weird mix of live-action and animation.  There's the real world, with flesh-and-blood people, some of whom discover they can cross over to Cool World, which is like a tawdry version of a Warner Bros. cartoon; anvils routinely fall on various cartoon extras, and countless noisy animated creatures race around the colourful scenery...but a few Doodles (animated characters) are really interested in sex with Noids (real people).  It turns out that too much shenanigans between Doodles and Noids crossing crazily between worlds can cause damage to the fabric of reality--like, destroy Cool World and Real World--especially if Holli Would, a sometimes drawn/sometimes real Kim Basinger--tampers with a Spike (some kind of key to keeping the worlds from intermixing) at the top of a casino in Las Vegas.Here's the real problem in this surreal film: we never care about the real-world characters...that would be Frank Harris (Brad Pitt) and Jack Deebs (Gabriel Byrne).  Harris is a fella who has a horrible motorcycle accident in 1945, before finding himself transported to Cool World, where he proceeds to make himself at home in a place where he can forever escape from reality beside a doodle girlfriend.  His mother dies in that motorcycle accident, but that doesn't matter; it has no bearing, unfortunately, on what happens to Frank Harris, and could easily have been written out of the movie.  But I can kind of forgive the 2D nature of Pitt's character because he inhabits a 2D world for most of the film--his only connections are to shrieking cartoon pratfallers, along with a few over-the-top doodle females who have only one emotion, sultriness, if that's an emotion (if it isn't, they have no emotions).  But I can forgive Pitt's character for having no complexity and very little personality: he's chosen to live in cartoonland with all its freedom from logic, tragedy, and edges.But Gabriel Byrne's character--Jack Deebs--is also completely uninteresting, and he has no excuses.  His real-world scenes add nothing to our interest in him.  We see him being released from prison--it doesn't matter.  We see him thrash around in Cool World--it doesn't matter, but at least it's an entertaining place to toss him.  Then, whenever he's thrust back into the real-world, Jack Deebs STILL doesn't matter.  We see him buying comics at a comic-book store, where he is recognized as the creator of Cool World: it doesn't matter.  We see him interact with his two neighbours: it also doesn't matter.  Byrne is a good actor, but he's got nothing to work with here, when it comes to making us care about him, or what happens to him.  With the scenes in Real World feeling as superficial as what happens in Cool World, the entire film begins to fragment into meaninglessness.  And near the end, when both realities are in jeopardy as Real World begins to morph into another animated world..uh...: it doesn't matter.Cool World, as a locale, is the best thing about the film, with its manic energy, it's hopping, howling, animated cast of thousands of unidentifiables.  It's fun to watch, in the way that most cartoons are fun to watch.  But the films is still obligated to make us care about the flesh-and-blood characters, and instead they're just bland.Despite my low rating, this film is actually worth a look, just for the strangeness of it.  But as a comedy--if that's what it's supposed to be--it is funny/strange, not funny/ha-ha.  Enjoy the funny/strange, I guess.

326985,A2RYN6F3519H2Z,6302662753,S. Schonberger,"[27, 48]","How do movies this bad get made? Cool World isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly on my ten worst list. (It might not be if I could remember the titles of the copyright-expired, black and white horror  movies I watched as a kid, but it's still incredibly bad.) It's even more  surprising that such a bad movie could be made because animation requires a  great deal of scripting, compared to live action that can be filmed while  the script is being re-written or even without a script. It's not even  &quot;so bad it's good&quot;, it's just plain bad.The best thing about  the movie is the basic idea: What if real people could have sex with  cartoon characters? That's not even all that great an idea, but the movie  is all downhill from there.The plot is a muddle. The main characters are  a live-action man and a cartoon woman. He finds her attractive, but knows  something bad (who knows what?) will happen if a person has sex with a  cartoon. What? If they explained, I don't remember. Why? I'm sure that was  never even hinted at. Of course they go ahead and have sex anyway (in a way  that's OK for the movie's mild age rating). Then bad stuff happens, and  various characters try to resolve the damage.That story is pretty dumb,  but it might have made at least enough sense to be an entertaining movie if  we had been given some ideas of the rules of the world where it intersects  with the cartoon world. In Roger Rabbit, we knew that nothing can truly  hurt a cartoon character except &quot;the dip&quot;, a solvent that was  rather nasty to real people too. In Cool World, there's no sense that any  laws of cartoon physics apply from one scene to the next. Nothing in the  entire movie really makes sense.The animation quality wasn't entirely  bad, but it wasn't anything special either. Saturday morning cartoons look  cheap, but that's because they're low budget. Cool World showed signs of a  big budget gone to waste. I could see the money in the animation, but the  animation was good craftsmanship with no creative vision. It was like  trying to find a plot in an animator's portfolio video.The live action  acting wasn't good either. I can't tell if they were just acting poorly,  were directed poorly, or just had such a hopeless script that no acting  could save it. Whatever the reason, the live action was just as  bad.Bakshi made at least one good movie, Wizards, so we know he can do  it. Why doesn't he?Shame on me for wasting my money (and time I could  have spent watching a good movie) to see this during its theatrical run.  Even renting it on tape is too much to pay. Don't even think of wasting  your money to *buy* it. It just encourages the movie industry to make more  terrible movies.",1,"Roger Rabbit, plus sex, minus any entertainment value.",964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,2740,"['How', 'do', 'movies', 'bad', 'get', 'made', 'Cool', 'World', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'ten', 'worst', 'list', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'could', 'remember', 'titles', 'copyright-expired', 'black', 'white', 'horror', 'movies', 'watched', 'kid', 'still', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'even', 'more', 'surprising', 'bad', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'animation', 'great', 'deal', 'scripting', 'compared', 'live', 'action', 'can', 'be', 'filmed', 'script', 'being', 're-written', 'even', 'script', 'not', 'even', 'quot', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'quot', 'just', 'plain', 'bad.The', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'basic', 'idea', 'What', 'real', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'sex', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'not', 'even', 'great', 'idea', 'movie', 'downhill', 'there.The', 'plot', 'muddle', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'live-action', 'man', 'cartoon', 'woman', 'attractive', 'something', 'bad', 'who', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'person', 'sex', 'cartoon', 'What', 'explained', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Why', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'hinted', 'course', 'go', 'ahead', 'have', 'sex', 'anyway', 'way', 'OK', 'movie', 'mild', 'age', 'rating', 'Then', 'bad', 'stuff', 'happens', 'various', 'characters', 'try', 'resolve', 'damage.That', 'story', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'least', 'enough', 'sense', 'be', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'ideas', 'rules', 'world', 'where', 'cartoon', 'world', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'knew', 'nothing', 'can', 'truly', 'hurt', 'cartoon', 'character', 'quot', 'dip', 'quot', 'solvent', 'was', 'rather', 'nasty', 'real', 'people', 'too', 'Cool', 'World', 'sense', 'laws', 'cartoon', 'physics', 'apply', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'Nothing', 'entire', 'movie', 'really', 'sense.The', 'animation', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'either', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'look', 'cheap', ""'re"", 'low', 'budget', 'Cool', 'World', 'showed', 'signs', 'big', 'budget', 'gone', 'waste', 'could', 'see', 'money', 'animation', 'animation', 'was', 'good', 'craftsmanship', 'creative', 'vision', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'plot', 'animator', 'portfolio', 'video.The', 'live', 'action', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'either', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'were', 'just', 'acting', 'poorly', 'were', 'directed', 'poorly', 'just', 'had', 'such', 'hopeless', 'script', 'acting', 'could', 'save', 'reason', 'live', 'action', 'was', 'just', 'bad.Bakshi', 'made', 'least', 'one', 'good', 'movie', 'Wizards', 'know', 'can', 'do', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Shame', 'wasting', 'money', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'watching', 'good', 'movie', 'see', 'theatrical', 'run', 'Even', 'renting', 'tape', 'too', 'much', 'pay', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'wasting', 'money', '*buy*', 'just', 'movie', 'industry', 'make', 'more', 'terrible', 'movies']",N/A

I saw this movie first in the theater with a good sound system, paid to see it at least 3 times, bought the two movie related albums, one traditional movie music, the other ""Inspired by"" which provide musical food as i worked my way through bands that appeared. Was not able to go back and compare music in the movie to inspired by.  Noticed familiar music in parts of the movie. Sat in a nearly empty theater on a weeknight, with the screen filling the view, like sitting arms length to a 42 inch wide screen, my first reaction to the movie was Cool World was like the nightmares I had as a child, scary.  Sent chills up my spine.  I didn't like parts, have been to Vegas so many times, the Vegas parts don't seem real.  But had to return and see it again before it was done with the theater run.  It affected me each time.  Combination of the music, energy, video.  Cool World is one that is/should be a cult classic.  It's not a romantic love story, only a little is shown of 'toon love and although Holly is desireable as drawn, she's the sort you'd want to stay away from in real life.
