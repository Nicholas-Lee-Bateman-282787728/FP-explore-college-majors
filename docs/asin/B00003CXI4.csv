525998,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,B00003CXI4,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[3, 4]","I recently read a quote about golf from 1908 that I really liked.  It observed, simply, that to be obsessed with golf &quot;is not so much a sign of pitiable insanity as of 'wilful' stupidity.&quot;  Well count me as one of the &quot;wilfully&quot; stupid and if you are too then THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE is a movie that you will absolutely love.The movie tells the story of a has-been champion golfer, Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon), who goes to war and loses his identity.  More importantly he also loses his swing (which to any golfer who knows IS his identity).  He leaves behind the course, his life and the girl.  The girl (Charlize Theron), upon the suicide of her father, becomes the owner of a championship golf course and, in order to put it on the map and get herself out of debt, plans an unlikely exhibition golf match and invites the day's golf greats Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill) to come and play.  There's just one problem.  The local city fathers, in order to draw a local gallery, demand that a local representative join the match.  Who else is to be invited? None other than Junuh.  Never mind that he has become a pathetic drunk and hasn't swung a club in years.  We need a miracle, right?Right! Enter Bagger Vance (Will Smith), a mysterious, ghostly caddy who appears out of nowhere and not only helps Junuh find his swing and his game but also face the demons that have come to roost between his ears and find himself again. Wil Smith steals the show and, in one of the final scenes, will literally dance his way into your heart.Directed by Robert Redford, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE is a beautiful movie to watch and goes well beyond golf as a game. This movie speaks of golf as an incomparable parable of life.  Jack Lemmon is wonderful in a cameo as an elderly golfer who is ready to take his game to a higher (perhaps angelic) level and narrates the tale as he thinks back to the magical events he witnessed as a boy.Whether you like golf or not THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE will be a movie that you will love.  Again, for the &quot;wilfully&quot; stupid, it's a great movie to watch just before your next round.THE HORSEMAN",5,FOR THE &quot;WILFULLY&quot; STUPID AND EVERYONE ELSE!,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,2177,"['recently', 'read', 'quote', 'golf', '1908', 'really', 'liked', 'observed', 'simply', 'be', 'obsessed', 'golf', 'quot', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sign', 'pitiable', 'insanity', ""'wilful"", 'stupidity.', 'quot', 'Well', 'count', 'one', 'quot', 'wilfully', 'quot', 'stupid', 'are', 'too', 'then', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'BAGGER', 'VANCE', 'movie', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love.The', 'movie', 'story', 'has-been', 'champion', 'golfer', 'Rannulph', 'Junuh', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'war', 'identity', 'More', 'importantly', 'also', 'swing', 'golfer', 'who', 'IS', 'identity', 'course', 'life', 'girl', 'girl', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'suicide', 'father', 'owner', 'championship', 'golf', 'course', 'order', 'put', 'map', 'get', 'debt', 'unlikely', 'exhibition', 'golf', 'match', 'day', 'golf', 'greats', 'Bobby', 'Jones', 'Joel', 'Gretsch', 'Walter', 'Hagen', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'come', 'play', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'local', 'city', 'fathers', 'order', 'draw', 'local', 'gallery', 'demand', 'local', 'representative', 'join', 'match', 'Who', 'else', 'be', 'invited', 'None', 'other', 'Junuh', 'Never', 'mind', 'become', 'pathetic', 'drunk', ""n't"", 'swung', 'club', 'years', 'need', 'miracle', 'right', 'Right', 'Enter', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'Will', 'Smith', 'mysterious', 'ghostly', 'caddy', 'who', 'nowhere', 'not', 'only', 'Junuh', 'find', 'swing', 'game', 'also', 'face', 'demons', 'have', 'come', 'roost', 'ears', 'find', 'again', 'Wil', 'Smith', 'show', 'one', 'final', 'scenes', 'will', 'literally', 'dance', 'way', 'heart.Directed', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'BAGGER', 'VANCE', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'watch', 'well', 'golf', 'game', 'movie', 'speaks', 'golf', 'incomparable', 'parable', 'life', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'wonderful', 'cameo', 'elderly', 'golfer', 'who', 'ready', 'take', 'game', 'higher', 'perhaps', 'angelic', 'level', 'tale', 'back', 'magical', 'events', 'witnessed', 'boy.Whether', 'like', 'golf', 'not', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'BAGGER', 'VANCE', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'will', 'love', 'Again', 'quot', 'wilfully', 'quot', 'stupid', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'just', 'next', 'round.THE', 'HORSEMAN']",N/A

526000,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXI4,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 11]","I made the mistake of seeing this back when it was released.  I say that (the `mistake' part) because I was not yet fully invested in the idea of expanding my taste in film and so I saw this under the preconceived notion that a Will Smith movie would be entertaining in a funny `haha' kind of way.  Yes, I knew it was a dramatic film, but really, I was young.  Anyways, I hated it.  That said, over this past decade, I have refined my taste in film and have begun to embrace and even laud films that are not your generic fare.  So, in an attempt to prove myself wrong, I decided to watch this film again.Some films, no matter what your taste level, are just bad.I've made mention of a similar problem when reviewing the equally mind numbing bore of a film entitled `The Turning Point' (although at least that film had two very good lead performances to lift it out of the trenches of pure travesty).  Some sports films cannot transcend their own genre.  You see, with most sports movies you don't really need to have a love or adoration or even respect for the game itself.  The film understands how to rise above the audience's feelings towards the sport in order to create a film that is appealing and entertaining regardless.  With `The Turning Point' and `The Legend of Bagger Vance', you practically have to be a devoted follower of the sport (in this instance, golf) to appreciate this film.  They liken this to `A River Runs Through It' but I degress, because at least that film had some compelling acting and a flowing tale of sibling affections.  This film borders on ridiculous and panders on full out boring from beginning to end.There is nothing here to grab you.And, on top of that, the acting is nothing to write home about.  I agree with those who state that the acting highlight here is the young J. Michael Moncrief (not so young anymore), and Lemmon's narration and small bit here is nicely done, but aside from them there is nothing to elevate the films mediocrity.  Charlize Theron can act, but she hasn't mastered acting and being pretty at the same time.  In other words, when she is pretty (like she is here) apparently she forgets how to act.  Matt Damon is a pretty good actor in my book, but he looks bored here.  Will Smith is just all sorts of hammy ridiculousness here.  Seriously, this is kind of embarrassing.I will say that this film is very pretty to look at.  The cinematography and technical aspects of this film are, at times, stunning.  Like my title suggests, this is a pretty bore.  So, technically this was a finely made film, but overall this is a complete waste of time.",1,A pretty bore...,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,2612,"['made', 'mistake', 'seeing', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'say', 'mistake', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'fully', 'invested', 'idea', 'expanding', 'taste', 'film', 'so', 'saw', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'Will', 'Smith', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'haha', 'kind', 'way', 'Yes', 'knew', 'was', 'dramatic', 'film', 'really', 'was', 'young', 'Anyways', 'hated', 'said', 'past', 'decade', 'have', 'refined', 'taste', 'film', 'have', 'begun', 'embrace', 'even', 'laud', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'generic', 'fare', 'So', 'attempt', 'prove', 'wrong', 'decided', 'watch', 'film', 'again.Some', 'films', 'matter', 'what', 'taste', 'level', 'are', 'just', 'bad.I', ""'ve"", 'made', 'mention', 'similar', 'problem', 'when', 'reviewing', 'equally', 'mind', 'numbing', 'bore', 'film', 'entitled', 'Turning', 'Point', 'least', 'film', 'had', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'lead', 'performances', 'lift', 'trenches', 'pure', 'travesty', 'sports', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'transcend', 'own', 'genre', 'see', 'most', 'sports', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'have', 'love', 'adoration', 'even', 'respect', 'game', 'film', 'how', 'rise', 'audience', 'feelings', 'sport', 'order', 'create', 'film', 'appealing', 'entertaining', 'regardless', 'Turning', 'Point', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'practically', 'have', 'be', 'devoted', 'follower', 'sport', 'instance', 'golf', 'appreciate', 'film', 'liken', 'River', 'Runs', 'degress', 'least', 'film', 'had', 'compelling', 'acting', 'flowing', 'tale', 'sibling', 'affections', 'film', 'borders', 'ridiculous', 'panders', 'full', 'out', 'boring', 'beginning', 'end.There', 'nothing', 'here', 'grab', 'you.And', 'top', 'acting', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'agree', 'who', 'state', 'acting', 'highlight', 'here', 'young', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Moncrief', 'not', 'so', 'young', 'anymore', 'Lemmon', 'narration', 'small', 'bit', 'here', 'nicely', 'done', 'aside', 'nothing', 'elevate', 'films', 'mediocrity', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'can', 'act', ""n't"", 'mastered', 'acting', 'being', 'pretty', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'words', 'when', 'pretty', 'here', 'apparently', 'how', 'act', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'book', 'bored', 'here', 'Will', 'Smith', 'just', 'sorts', 'hammy', 'ridiculousness', 'here', 'Seriously', 'kind', 'embarrassing.I', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'very', 'pretty', 'look', 'cinematography', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'times', 'stunning', 'title', 'pretty', 'bore', 'So', 'technically', 'was', 'finely', 'made', 'film', 'overall', 'complete', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

526004,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00003CXI4,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[23, 25]","One of the things I love best about Robert Redford's movies is the singular visual quality he employs in each, and the way he uses the environment to add to the telling of the tale. Whether it be in the breath-taking ""A River Runs Through It"", in which the stunning Montana countryside is a virtual unattributed co-star in the film, or ""The Horse Whisperer"", in which every rugged natural element about the pristine rural surroundings add to the tale, he always uses his topography, climate, and setting to charm the audience into the frame of reference he is using to spin his yarn. This is no less so here, where he uses the gorgeous background of the rural countryside in telling this tale of a man coming to terms with his potential.This is a classic tale of a professional golfer with almost unlimited potential who is content to let it all ride because he is basically afraid of success. And with Matt Damon, he finds a believable and sympathetic protagonist who decides to take the chance and make the effort based on the mysterious appearance and subsequent profound influence of Bagger Vance, an almost angelic figure who we are finally left to wonder about. Will Smith steps out of his usual cocky roles to give a thoughtful and whimsical performance, and add immeasurably to the film.Smith acts as a fulcrum throughout the movie, showing us the wisdom of homespun realism as opposed to city wisdom, of simple virtues as opposed to more sophisticated aims and pursuits, and of honesty and craftsmanship over gamesmanship and conniving.This movie is very much in line with his previous efforts in ""the Natural', another whimsical tale about a man coming to term with his talents and his demons, learning to finally accept both as coming from him at the same time he resolves his existential situation. This is the case here, too, and one walks away from the film feeling good about the world. And watching Charlize Theron support her man is enough to make anyone cheer.This is beautifully filmed period piece, and all of the production values from costumes to dialogue to settings to historical accuracy are impeccable drawn together in service to the plot and resolution. The golf sequences are extremely well done, and there is hardly a golf fan in the world who wouldn't like the film just on that basis alone. For those of us who are fans of Redford's work, this is another in a series of thoughtful efforts to paint us a picture of an alternative side to this busy and frantic world we might otherwise never see.

But WW I pulls him away and destroys his will to play the ""gentlemen's game."" In WW I he also loses everyone in his platoon and is the only survivor. Feeling as if he should have lost ""something"", his ""authentic swing"" vanishes ...and so does he. He fails to return to his Savannah, Georgia home and his fianc&eacute;, Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron).Adele is struggling to keep her father's dream of maintaining the ultimate golf course alive. So she finesses two top golf players in to playing a winner take all ($10,000) game. But many in Savannah want a local player to compete in the game as well. And a young boy named Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief) pipes up that ""Captain Junuh"" should do it. Since Junuh had recently snuck back into town, the townsfolk approach him and convince him to play. But what to do about his lost authentic swing?Enter the mysterious and mystical Bagger Vance (Will Smith). He shows Junuh the way back to a magical state of the authentic swing and acts as his caddy during the competition. He also teaches young Hardy how to caddy/play the game of golf, and helps Junuh and Adele find love again.*************************************************************************Robert Redford directs and does so admirably. The beautiful cinematography and the way the story unfolds are nicely pulled off. And like ""A River Runs Through It"", this film has a leisurely cadence that deals with a subject matter that could put many people to sleep. But it doesn't. The character development and interestingly vague aspects of Bagger Vance's existence add much to the entertaining story.But the film doesn't break any new cinematic ground. The story, although nicely done, is very predictable and sometimes trite. Can Junuh find a love for golf that he lost so long ago?

526009,ABLWGDPUOSEXR,B00003CXI4,Bradford Wilson,"[2, 2]","I was a little reluctant to watch this movie.  First of all, the trailers made it look like a sweeping love story, which is of little interest to me, and it had Will Smith in it which is not a push in the right direction.  But when I left the theatre, I felt rejuvinated and ready to play golf.The movie opens with a shot of an old man (Jack Lemon) golfing and reminiscing about his youth and how he knew Junah, the best golfer that ever lived.  The movie then goes on auto-pilot, and the narration is scattered here and there.  A golf course is in trouble, so the owner, Adele (Charlize Theron) decides to hold a golf tournament where only the best golfers are invited.  Junah has been dormant for years, and is not ready to play golf.  While he is hitting some midnight drivers, a man by the name of Bagger Vance comes out of no where and gives him some pointers.  He then stays with Junah through the rest of the movie, as his caddy and spiritual advisor. Sound crazy?  Not really.This movie is not so much about golf, (although roughly 50% of it is the tournament) but about self-discovery and finding one's passions in life.  The acting is great, and Charlize Theron is pleasantly annoying.  Will Smith's performance actually made me like him again.  And Matt Damon, with the trickiest role in the film, did a wonderful job of conveying the transformation from a drunkard to a lover of life.I really liked this film.  It made me feel good and when it was over, I had something to think about.

526010,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B00003CXI4,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[2, 3]","&quot;The game of golf cannot be won, only played.&quot;  True words from Bagger Vance in a film that surprised me, as I had given up on a great golf movie ever being made.  &quot;Caddyshack&quot; is a riot, of course, but it's a party movie that happens to take place at a country club, and &quot;Tin Cup&quot; is barely compelling and has one of the worst endings in movie history.It seems odd that it's taken so long for this to happen.  Golf is a subject that many people can wax poetic about at great length, its mythology being a thing of reverence.  And perhaps that's why it's taken so long, because that's such a subjective, internal, personal thing, and golf is a game of one where everything is internalized.  Man must face the course, the elements, and himself, let alone anyone he's in competition with.But for me, &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; is all fairways and greens, with never a bunker shot or a duck hook into the woods.  Oh, sure, like the great game itself, the film occasionally falls a bit short of perfect, but only just a bit, and, again like the great game itself, it also occasionally takes my breath away in a moment of shining brilliance.This all requires actually caring about the game of golf itself, of course, and any film that utilizes legends Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen in strong supporting roles had better get it right.  Well, those two characters are right in line with everything I've ever heard and read about these two, having played and studied the game for 35 years myself, Hagen the hard-drinking womanizer and Jones the perfect Southern gentlemen.  That alone is a joy to behold, but add in the scenes where we see the psychology of the game play out and we have the foundation of a great film.The crowning touch is the way &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; gets beyond the externals and helps us feel the internals that the lead character is feeling, going through his struggles on and off the golf course, rising above his long-lost game to play a truly great round of golf again, where, as Bagger says, &quot;Completely stop thinking without falling asleep.&quot;I'd nitpick that Matt Damon plays the lead character of Junuh with too much &quot;I can't believe I hit that shot&quot; on his face, and that Will Smith's title character is treated far too nicely by white folks in the Depression-Era Deep South, but as I say, the film gets the previously unachieved moments so SO right that I can't nitpick much.Dang, now I've gotta read the book......",5,"At last, a great golf movie!",1079308800,"03 15, 2004",2004,2515,"['quot', 'game', 'golf', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'won', 'only', 'played.', 'quot', 'True', 'words', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'film', 'surprised', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'great', 'golf', 'movie', 'ever', 'being', 'made', 'quot', 'Caddyshack', 'quot', 'riot', 'course', 'party', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'country', 'club', 'quot', 'Tin', 'Cup', 'quot', 'barely', 'compelling', 'one', 'worst', 'endings', 'movie', 'history.It', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'happen', 'Golf', 'subject', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'wax', 'poetic', 'great', 'length', 'mythology', 'being', 'thing', 'reverence', 'perhaps', 'why', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'subjective', 'internal', 'personal', 'thing', 'golf', 'game', 'one', 'where', 'everything', 'internalized', 'Man', 'must', 'face', 'course', 'elements', 'let', 'alone', 'anyone', 'competition', 'with.But', 'quot', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'quot', 'fairways', 'greens', 'never', 'bunker', 'shot', 'duck', 'hook', 'woods', 'Oh', 'sure', 'great', 'game', 'film', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'short', 'perfect', 'only', 'just', 'bit', 'again', 'great', 'game', 'also', 'occasionally', 'breath', 'away', 'moment', 'shining', 'brilliance.This', 'actually', 'caring', 'game', 'golf', 'course', 'film', 'Bobby', 'Jones', 'Walter', 'Hagen', 'strong', 'supporting', 'roles', 'had', 'better', 'get', 'right', 'Well', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'right', 'line', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'read', 'two', 'having', 'played', 'studied', 'game', '35', 'years', 'hard-drinking', 'womanizer', 'Jones', 'perfect', 'Southern', 'gentlemen', 'alone', 'joy', 'behold', 'add', 'scenes', 'where', 'see', 'psychology', 'game', 'play', 'out', 'have', 'foundation', 'great', 'film.The', 'crowning', 'touch', 'way', 'quot', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'quot', 'externals', 'feel', 'internals', 'lead', 'character', 'feeling', 'going', 'struggles', 'golf', 'course', 'rising', 'long-lost', 'game', 'play', 'truly', 'great', 'round', 'golf', 'again', 'where', 'Bagger', 'quot', 'Completely', 'stop', 'thinking', 'falling', 'asleep.', 'quot', ""'d"", 'nitpick', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'lead', 'character', 'Junuh', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hit', 'shot', 'quot', 'face', 'Will', 'Smith', 'title', 'character', 'treated', 'far', 'too', 'nicely', 'white', 'folks', 'Depression-Era', 'Deep', 'South', 'say', 'film', 'previously', 'unachieved', 'moments', 'so', 'SO', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'nitpick', 'much.Dang', 'now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'read', 'book']",N/A

And this is surprising, particularly due to the outstanding cast and director.  We have Robert Redford -- I don't even need to tell you about the movies that he's starred in -- who, in my opinion, is such a good director that he turned around Brad Pitt in ""A River Runs Through It"" and was able coerce Mr. Pitt into actually becoming a pretty fine actor.  We have Matt Damon, who made one of my favorite films ever, ""Good Will Hunting.""  We have Will Smith, who's a sometimes-excellent actor in his own right.  But last but not least, we have Charlize Theron, who seems to never make a misstep.  Well, except here, of course.Ms. Theron is really just a prop in this film, and a cartoonish one at that.  Mr. Damon doesn't seem to say too much, in particular on the golf course, but rather leaves all of that up to Mr. Smith.  And some of the dialog that Mr. Smith has to say is absolutely unbelievable and worse yet, embarrassing.  I just watched a very funny film called ""Hollywood Shuffle,"" and one of my favorite scenes has Robert Townsend and a buddy sneak into a movie theatre, and they pretend to be Siskel and Ebert and discuss and rate the films while watching.  Their dialog was hilarious.  And here's what I think that they might say if they saw this film:""I didn't believe that this film was real.  It couldn't happen.  First of all, we've got Will Smith, who looks all pumped up and ---- in 'Ali,' who's the caddy for Matt Damon.  No. . . way.  It should be the other way around.  Now, do you think that Tiger Woods would be carrying the bag for Steve Williams?  Didn't think so.  It's the other way around.

Combine the two well - like ""Field Of Dreams"" and like this movie - and I am sure to rate this extremely high. I've seen it three times and enjoyed it immensely each time.It reminded me a bit, too, of ""The Natural,"" but instead of baseball, this one features golf and real-life legends Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen playing the local guy, ""Rannulph Junuh"" (Matt Damon). Like ""The Natural,"" this is beautifully photographed, has a wonderful feel-good ending, a variety of characters, a beautiful lead woman and good acting.The no-name child actor in here, J. Michael Moncrief, who plays ""Hardy Greaves,"" narrates the film as an older man looking back on this story. The kid is a fine actor, too, and I really enjoyed his Georgia accent. Charlize Theron is the beauty, playing ""Adele Invergordon,"" a woman who organizes this famous golf match between the greatest amateur player of the world, the best professional and ""Junuh,"" who is the focus of this story. Theron's known for her dramatic roles but she exhibits a nice comedy touch in here.Damon does his normal fine job of acting and Will Smith, as the angelic caddie ""Bagger Vance,"" is uncharacteristically low-key, which I found nice to see. Bruce McGill did a good as Hagen and Joel Gretsch, likewise, for Jones. McGill is obviously the best real-life golfer here among these actors.

526023,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00003CXI4,David E. Levine,"[5, 6]","I expected this movie to be horribly miscast with Will Smith as Bagger Vance, thinking that someone like Morgan Freeman was better suited for the role. Smith is miscast but not as badly as I had anticipated. He actually did a decent job as the mysterious caddie who caddies for a local golfer named Rannulph Junah. In the setting of the early 1930s, Junah is a former local golf hero whose glory days were prior to WWI. That war took a lot out of him (he was a captain in the army) and he was never the same. At a resort near Savanah, GA, Junah is coaxed back into golf to compete in a golf match against the great Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.Quite frankly, having read the book, I think it was Matt Damon who was miscast as Junah. First, if you do the math from WWI to the height of the depression, Junah would have most like been in his mid thirties. However, Damon appeared to be no older than 30. Second, Junah was a withdrawn, troubled individual who was almost reclusive due to his war experiences. He was an intense individual in the book. Damon's portrayal showed him as outgoing as he enjoyed the limelight. This portrayal is not my impression of Junah.My favorite portrayal was that of Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen. He looked like Hagen and he bahaved as I always imagined Hagen would. Hagen was quite a character &amp; showman. McGill captured this.There were other problems with the movie. There were mystical elements to the novel that the movie did not really capture. There were minor changes in the plot. Also, the resort had mystical elements. It had been destroyed by a hurricane in the book but this was not mentioned at all in the movie. The disappearance of the course (except for the 18th hole which somehow remained) added to the aura of mystery.As against the book, I would have rated this vhs 3 stars but, if you do not compare it to the book, the movie stands up fairly well on its own.

In this case - what do you do when you are lost?Fortunately for us Redford is never without some attempt at an answer - whether through fly fishing, helping a horse and family through their demons, or simply trying to find an authentic golf swing as in Bagger Vance.The movie is exceptionally well acted and moves at a comtemplative pace which is kind because Redford gives us plenty to think about.Myth is full of Baggers.

526025,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXI4,D. Litton,"[2, 3]","Robert Redford's films have a unique and visceral vision to them that vividly creates an illustrious picture of human life in new and fascinating ways. &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; is a definitive Redford film, embodying a story that has an upfront meaning in its events and a deeper meaning upon further examination of the characters and their experiences. I feel that it has a delightful lesson to teach us about life's experiences, while balancing out the many different elements of the plot and keeping us involved with what is going on; This is a movie to shout about.The film centers around a fictional golf match which takes place in Savannah, Georgia in the 1930's, involving two real-life golf stars as well as a fictional character, who is just beginning to regain his confidence in his ability to play the game. That fictional character is Rannulph Junuh, once regarded as the best golfer in the South for his intense ability and incredible swing of the club. His enlistment in World War I causes him severe psychological suffering, and is not seen in Savannah for another ten years after that.This coincides with the arrival of the Great Depression in the town, which causes the land buyers to come calling on Adele Invergordon, whose father, who committed suicide, spent a fortune in building the grandest and most expensive golf course and resort in the South. Adele refuses to let the resort go, and concocts a plan to hold a match between infamous golf players Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen, both of whom she easily persuades to join the match. The townspeople refuse to agree to the match unless a Savannah native plays as well, which leads them to the home of now-returned Junuh, as well as giving us an introspective into the shared past between he and Adele.Junuh refuses to take part in the match (&quot;I lost my swing,&quot; he says), despite persuasions by different people in different ways, but his mind gets the better of him and he goes outside in the night to hit golfballs. A stranger by the name of Bagger Vance arrives from the darkness, and persuades him to play in the tournament with him as his caddy. As the tournament begins and progresses, Junuh finds his &quot;lost swing&quot; with Bagger's help and advice, while slowly mending his frayed relationship with Adele and providing inspiration to a small boy, Hardy, who serves as the narrator of the story.This is a movie that takes its subject material in stride, giving us the important details and twists at just the right times. The stories balance out with one another so that we're not bogged down by the rebudding romance of Adele and Junuh, nor do we get the impression that the movie is trying too hard to glorify its portrayed sport. Piece by piece it unfolds before us in all its glory, majesty and poetic emotion.The movie is not just about the game of golf, nor is it solely about romance and bonds of friendship: it's about the rediscovery of a lost part of one's soul, and the help that a person may receive with that search. Junuh's lost swing is more than just his sports talent, but also comes to represent his loss of self worth and reality upon his return from the war. His entering into the golf tournament as well as the insight and wisdom he receives from Bagger are more than just a game and advice: they are Junuh's reawakening into the world, his realization of the love and knowledge he has lost due to his self-ostracization from everyone.This story provides a path for Redford's extraordinary vision, and like his previous films, his sense of surroundings and the beauty of nature shine throughout this film. The golf course on which the game is played is lush, green and full of wide open spaces, and Redford uses this to his advantage in making it more than just a golf course. Junuh's war experiences are shot grainy and with shadow, providing a gloomy and foreboding sense of depression and doom for a time in his life that is simply that. Redford has a very insightful eye into nature, which is evident in his work on this movie, adding to its overall sense of beauty and awe.The 30's are also brought to life in a breathtaking fashion, recreating a time of colorful hats for the ladies and tops hats for men, outfits bursting with bright colors and accesories calling attention to a time gone by. While most of the movie takes place outdoors, indoor set design is meticulous, while the small town of Savannah is seen in many different lights, once bustling and alive, then soon plagued by deep depression.Our cast appears to enjoy their work on this film, and their performances are convincing and inspire emotion. Matt Damon is no stranger to deep character development: his past work on &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; prove this. So it should come as no surprise that his performance as Junuh is pivotal and full of exhuberance. Will Smith is a little out of his league with his role as Bagger Vance, but that doesn't mean he can't pull it off. He makes his character mysterious, which is one question the movie never answers: is he simply a figment in the imagination of certain characters, or is he really there? Either way, his character has a job to do, and he gets it done. Charlize Theron's beauty and demeanor are completely reminiscent of the women of this time period, while the feistiness of her character, Adele, is acted out incredibly. Her chemistry with Damon is believable, which sells me on their romance.&quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; doesn't take long in presenting its underlying meanings, nor does it make it too difficult to spot them, which is why this movie will appeal to many different demographics. I enjoyed this movie immensely because it nevers gets too soggy with the romance, or too indistinct with its themes and metaphors, and the performances are remarkable. This has all the makings of a classic film, and will not be forgotten by many.",4,A nicely paced and moving picture.,988070400,"04 24, 2001",2001,5951,"['Robert', 'Redford', 'films', 'have', 'unique',

526026,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B00003CXI4,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","Robert Redford can make one fine looking film.  THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE, with the game of golf providing the lush setting--along with its metaphor for life--is as handsome as movies get.  Set in the early Thirties, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE tells the story of Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon), a down-on-his-luck World War I vet suffering from PTSD.  (Only back in those days, the ailment was called excessive drinking.)  And it is also the story of a mysterious, metaphysically inspired caddie named Bagger Vance (Will Smith), a mystic who helps Rannulph rediscover his pure golf swing during an exhibition in Savannah featuring three men--Rannulph, Bobby Jones, and Walter Hagen.  The story is narrated by Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief), a youth who is pulling for Rannulph to get back in the groove.  As the exhibition concludes, after dark--with countless headlights from cars lighting the 18th hole--the onlookers are treated to a remarkable finish, and Bagger Vance the Legend sets itself in motion.The cast is solid, although I never could appreciate or understand the character played by Charlize Theron (a socialite whose father is underwriting Rannulph's comeback).  I really enjoyed Bruce McGill playing a feisty, fun-loving, slightly corrupt Walter Hagen.

Great visuals, scenery, casting, acting and of course, directing.Great performances all around by Will Smith (Bagger Vance), who gently leads Matt Damon (Rannulph Junuh) from his meandering, disillusioned life, back to the top of his game and back to his Socialite true love played by Charlese Theron.  Jack Lemmon's reminiscent narration was just about perfect, as well.Story:Damon, is lost in life for years after his personal tragic experience in WWI.  He is unavoidably caught up in a celebrity golf match in his home town of Savannah, GA in 1931.  Previously ranked as one of the greatest players ever, he in unable to play to his previous skill level.Junuh is without hope until a mystical caddie (Will Smith) shows up offering sage advice, support and Socratic direction.Recommendation:A good playful, mystical movie, like most Redford movies.Leaves you with a warm heart.Good movie for warm cuddling together!",4,Spritely Mystical Movie,1035244800,"10 22, 2002",2002,1115,"['.Summary', 'Review', 'typically', 'enchanting', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Director', 'bygone', 'era', 'movie', 'depicting', 'mystical', 'virtues', 'game', 'golf', 'nature', 'rhythm', 'philosophically', 'symbolized', 'lives', 'Great', 'visuals', 'scenery', 'casting', 'acting', 'course', 'directing.Great', 'performances', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'who', 'gently', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Rannulph', 'Junuh', 'meandering', 'disillusioned', 'life', 'back', 'top', 'game', 'back', 'Socialite', 'true', 'love', 'played', 'Charlese', 'Theron', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'reminiscent', 'narration', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'well.Story', 'Damon', 'lost', 'life', 'years', 'personal', 'tragic', 'experience', 'WWI', 'unavoidably', 'caught', 'up', 'celebrity', 'golf', 'match', 'home', 'town', 'Savannah', 'GA', '1931', 'Previously', 'ranked', 'one', 'greatest', 'players', 'ever', 'unable', 'play', 'previous', 'skill', 'level.Junuh', 'hope', 'mystical', 'caddie', 'Will', 'Smith', 'up', 'offering', 'sage', 'advice', 'support', 'Socratic', 'direction.Recommendation', 'good', 'playful', 'mystical', 'movie', 'most', 'Redford', 'warm', 'heart.Good', 'movie', 'warm', 'cuddling', 'together']",N/A

Will Smith plays a character which should be hosting a show like Oprah, with all his deep thoughts on life. I became bored with that character within about two minutes.

The people who complain about the irrationality of having a respected black caddy in this movie are totally missing the point of the movie, and should probably watch it again without trying to be Roger Ebert (who liked the movie, incidentally). Movies are to be entertained. They're made for viewer enjoyment. Bagger Vance accomplishes that in Many different ways. It'll make you laugh, and it might make you teary eyed. It comes with a real meaning (one that's apparently difficult for some 'intelligent' people to grasp), and the fantastic entertainment level of this movie doesn't come at the expense of the message...or vice versa. It's a beautiful story with Very enjoyable, believable characters in a fun movie that should make you feel exhilerated and fulfilled by the time the closing credits roll.I watched it at the theater, and it filled me tremendously. Then I bought the DVD, watched it, and I probably loved it even more the second time.  The DVD comes with some interviews that add to the enjoyment of this movie. Sound and picture quality are terrific.Get the movie, and love the movie. And if you start watching it and wonder why Bagger Vance isn't getting beat up and called the &quot;N&quot; word every five minutes, then realize that you're missing the point.

And golf, being an observer and not a player, is pretty dang boring. Therefore trying to imagine that life is all about 'findin yo swang' ain't gonna cut it.What's worse is that Charlize Theron, one of the best actresses who's never been in a good movie, is amazing in this film. The best part of it, unfortunately (considering she's a minor character).Not to mention the plot holes in this movie are big enough to drive a cadillac through. For example, Matt Damon's character is 'lost' after the war (ie, no ones seen him), yet, after being needed, it takes a 9-year old boy ten seconds of screen time to bike over to the guy's house and get him. Hmmm...Subpar acting by the 'major players' (yes, that was a pun), a story that needs so much work it might as well have stayed a book for all the cinematic greatness it achieved, and too much mysticism for it to do anything to anybody who doesn't play golf. You'll see the ending coming a mile away, and anyone who's not asleep at the end gets a trophy all their own.Two and a half hours of your life could be better spent elsewhere.",1,The Legend of Boring Video,987379200,"04 16, 2001",2001,1221,"[""'Leisurely"", 'paced', 'how', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'Nope', 'let', 'scratch', 'new', 'term', 'Boring', 'Snot', 'story', 'life', 'golf', 'golf', 'being', 'observer', 'not', 'player', 'pretty', 'dang', 'boring', 'Therefore', 'trying', 'imagine', 'life', ""'findin"", 'yo', 'swang', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'cut', 'it.What', 'worse', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'amazing', 'film', 'best', 'part', 'unfortunately', 'considering', 'minor', 'character', '.Not', 'mention', 'plot', 'movie', 'are', 'big', 'enough', 'drive', 'cadillac', 'example', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', ""'lost"", 'war', 'ie', 'ones', 'seen', 'yet', 'being', 'needed', '9-year', 'old', 'boy', 'ten', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time', 'bike', 'guy', 'house', 'get', 'Hmmm', 'Subpar', 'acting', ""'major"", 'players', 'yes', 'was', 'pun', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'stayed', 'book', 'cinematic', 'greatness', 'achieved', 'too', 'much', 'mysticism', 'do', 'anything', 'anybody', 'who', ""n't"", 'play', 'golf', ""'ll"", 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'asleep', 'end', 'trophy', 'own.Two', 'half', 'hours', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'spent', 'elsewhere']",N/A
526033,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXI4,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 3]","As a director, Robert Redford has gained a reputation for making beautifully photographed human-interest stories (""The Horse Whisperer"", ""A River Runs Through It"") and this film fits that mold.  From a production standpoint, this film is an 11.  It has gorgeous photography, incredible locations, wonderful period costumes and props, and terrific golf sequences.  The story is an old-fashioned underdog story with a man fighting against the odds and himself in quest of victory and self respect.  It gets a bit corny at times with the ""Golf is Life"" metaphors and the story is predictable, but Redford conjures fascinating characters and endows the story with a great deal of affability.If there is one area where the film falters, it is in the character of Bagger Vance.  This is no reflection on Will Smith, who did an outstanding job with the character.  It has more to do with the way the character is written and Redford's way of presenting him.  Vance is presented in a way that is too quirky and enigmatic which dissipates some of his impact.  There has been much speculation about the character.  Is he a real person, or an angel, or is he just a representation of Junuh's (Matt Damon) mental battle with himself?  The last scene points to the angel theory, but Redford purposely leaves the issue nebulous.It is a mistake for Redford to personify Vance as a black man dressed like a hobo.  In Savannah in the 1930's, you were not likely to have seen a black caddie at an exclusive country club, particularly one dressed in tattered clothes.  Redford completely ignores the issue of racial bigotry in the film.  During the entire film, not a single person makes so much as a crossways look or comment at this disheveled black person consorting with high society, which is utterly unrealistic and anachronistic.  Perhaps Redford is trying to contrast the wisdom of simple folks against the deluded self-importance of the wealthy, which is a noble message with a ring of truth.  However, the incongruence of the character and the times makes the entire story much less like a legend and more like a contrived fairy tale.As an enthusiast for the game, I am delighted at how wonderfully the golf scenes are done.  From an athletic standpoint, Joel Gretsch is a marvelous choice for Bobby Jones because Gretsch has a classic golf swing as did Jones.  Similarly, Bruce McGill does a good job imitating Hagan.  McGill is an avid golfer and he adjusted his swing to make it more ugly, more like Hagan's swing.  The biggest surprise is Matt Damon, who never picked up a golf club until this film.  He worked with a golf-pro, and developed a nice looking swing, hitting some fine shots in the process.The acting is outstanding.  Damon gives another superb performance, capturing the conflict and determination of the character and the mental gymnastics of the sport.  Charlize Theron is full of affected southern charm and belts out a fine Georgia accent.  Bruce McGill is flamboyant and charismatic as the pompous Hagen.  Though I don't agree with the way Bagger Vance is presented as a character, I can't imagine anyone doing a better portrayal of him than Will Smith did.  Smith is charming, wily and cantankerous giving Vance a wise yet homespun air.  J. Michael Moncrief is a local boy who was selected in a talent search to play Hardy Greaves and he does a phenomenal job, handling his character like a pro.This is a beautiful film to watch and a gift to golf lovers.  The story is somewhat trite, but the presentation is splendid.  I rated it an 8/10 on the strength of the production values and my love of the game.  Subtract one or two points if you think golf is boring.

Oneness is a feeling and when you feel it, great things happen, as Junuh became aware of.Robert Redford directed this winner and, as always, had an outstanding cast with a twist of thought for the script.Some people will enjoy the movie only for the golfing theme but it's far more than any golf game. Other reviewers here found that out, and some reviewers have no clue to the deep meaning in the movie and sought out criticism of how the Southern accent was portrayed. Those people are still in the 'rough'.Junuh had to dig deep down within himself to gather the feeling that drives him on to a winning situation salvaged from a beaten-down self-image and having the odds against his favor. Such is life and we all have that same within-ness to draw from. Bagger Vance was only the outward appearance of one who comes into and out of our lives or he was one who appears for a short time, bringing a message of hope and inspiration (much like Jesus), then leaves because he knows we'll never discover ourselves unless we HAVE to.An excellent film.

Adele Invergordon  (Charlize Theron) Junuh's former love interest, comes up with the  crazy notion to put on a golf tournament at the same course her dad built, right before he committed suicde. But the game could not go on unless someone could dig up Junuh. So one of his biggest fans (J.Michael Moncrief) goes to dig him out of the lowest place in the community. But Junuh says that he won't even consider it, and anymore talk is a waste of time. But shortly after that, Junuh gives it a shot. When he is practicing at night, a man comes walking out of the dark. Bagger Vance (Will Smith) tells him that he is here to help Junuh get his &quot;swing back&quot; that Junuh claims he lost long ago. But Vance through great persuading gets Junuh to join the tournament. He will go up against two greats, Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen  (Bruce McGill.) What Redford does here is takes a story and plays it along slowly, but not to slow! Through a great eye he makes it realistic enough to where you can't help but wonder that it could or did take place. The only thing that could have been a problem was that since Vance was a black man, he didn't get any trouble from anyone. All the more this took place in the south in the 1930's.

Redford has assembled an outstanding cast for this movie such as Matt Damon who plays Runnolph Junnah the main character, the beautiful Charlize Theron as his love interest and Will Smith as Bagger Vance the caddy and quite possibly his conscience. Without going into detail about the movie the overview is Junnah (Damon) portarys a golfer who once had great potential, but the horrors of WWI changes his views of life, and his game of Golf.  Theron a Savannah socialite portrays his love interest who has almost given up on him, and Bagger Vance (Smith) a mysterious man/golf caddie who shows Junnah how to get back into the &quot;swing&quot; of Golf.

Bobbie Jones and Walter Hagen are played without over-embellishment for example.  As a golfer who has read the Mahabharat, I am drawn to the idea of the interplay between the game and the epic.I thoroughly enjoyed the scene with Bagger Vance describing how the grain of the green and moisture content shifts during the day.  I thought that might be setting up a scene or two later - but it didn't really.  It was mostly just about establishing the character.  I was a bit surprised to see from the golf perspective more emphasis on the driving than the putting.  The middle game had a lot of coverage, but mostly when one of the golfers was in trouble.  All this didn't convey the kind of experience I have on the course.  It seemed like Hollywood golf to me and I don't think that it was necessary for them to film it that way.The film also lacked a sense of history I couldn't get over.  The setting was about the same time that Bobbie Jones helped found Augusta, just 2.5 hours down the road from Savannah.  And this is not just the depression, this is also the Jim Crow period of the south.  Black caddies were probably common, but we all know that none would be allowed to play the course - that's not treated.  In fact the  first African American  member of Augusta wasn't until 1990.But such a beautiful period piece can't afford room for the not-so-nice chapters of Savannah society.  As the only significant African American role in the film, I think Will Smith did well.

Also, his new book due to be released in July 2006 is on the trail for another pioneering blaze of a tale.",5,This Is Not A Film About Golf,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,837,"['Steven', 'Pressfield', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'authors', 'perhaps', 'when', 'done', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'authors', 'time', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Pressfield', 'novel', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'was', 'based', 'questions', 'are', 'destined', 'struggle', 'golf', 'pool', 'basketball', 'embroidery', 'how', 'will', 'choose', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'consequences', 'may', 'make', 'despised', 'humiliated', 'rejected', 'world', 'how', 'will', 'navigate', 'cilivized', 'culture', 'still', 'killing', 'solution', 'contrary', 'positions', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'film', 'please', 'have', 'time', 'buy', 'Steven', 'Pressfield', 'book', 'will', 'literally', 'blow', 'away', 'Also', 'new', 'book', 'due', 'be', 'released', 'July', '2006', 'trail', 'pioneering', 'blaze', 'tale']",N/A

In the words of one befuddled moviegoer, (Lindy Merrill, Texas A&amp;M University Construction Science major), ""I didn't know golf could be so dramatic.""  TLBV introduces Bagger Vance, played by Will-""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air""-Smith, a vagabond (celestial?) which makes appearances, intervenes in Life's course, and then disappears-ostensibly off to inspire another poor soul to find his/her ""field.""  The concept of  ""field"" is cryptically encoded, so that only movie audiences familiar with Zen Golf can comprehend its deep, philosophical meaning.  Under the scriptures of golf religions, you will find the mantra, ""Everyone has they own authentic swing,"" according to Vance.  This is an allegory on life.The Next, Next Robert Redford. Brad Pitt with his good looks and cool savoir faire has often been referred to as the next Robert Redford.  With that in mind, Matt Damon is the next, next Redford.  Damon, comes off smooth and silkily slides into his role as, Rannalph Judah.  Nothing is unnatural about this man.  He is a golden boy with a believable smile, ocean-blue eyes, and the perfect ire of an underdog golfer of the 1920's.Enjoyable Storyline Based on the novel by Steven Pressfield, director Robert Redford brings the 1920's to life with vivid imagery of golf as it were.  In the opening scene, seasoned ace Jack Lemmon, Old Hardy Greaves, has a heart attack, and while lying supine on the rough, reminisces about his childhood, including a chance encounter with Bagger Vance.  He remembers Judah and Judah's estranged lover Adele Invergordon, (actress Charlize Theron-who by the way has a heinous Georgia accent), and thus recants their tale of golf and life.Golf's Alright In the end, TLBV is an enjoyable movie, just pay no attention to its grasp at something substantial.  Ignore the underdeveloped characters, but enjoy the actors and setting.  Take the humor with a grain of 1920's salt, because it's rather dated, but if your willing to suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours, you will find yourself loving the game-golf, not life.",2,&#65533;Bagger Vance&#65533;s&#65533; Meaning of Life Lands in a Sandtrap,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,2234,"['MonitorThe', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'flick', 'drowning', 'overwritten', 'melodrama', 'saved', 'enjoyable', 'artists', 'storyline', 'life-preservers.Let', 'Get', 'Dramatical', 'words', 'one', 'befuddled', 'moviegoer', 'Lindy', 'Merrill', 'Texas', 'A', 'amp', 'M', 'University', 'Construction', 'Science', 'major', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'golf', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'dramatic', 'TLBV', 'introduces', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'played', 'Will-', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel', 'Air', '-Smith', 'vagabond', 'celestial', 'appearances', 'intervenes', 'Life', 'course', 'then', 'disappears-ostensibly', 'inspire', 'poor', 'soul', 'find', 'his/her', 'field', 'concept', 'field', 'cryptically', 'encoded', 'only', 'movie', 'audiences', 'familiar', 'Zen', 'Golf', 'can', 'comprehend', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'meaning', 'scriptures', 'golf', 'religions', 'will', 'find', 'mantra', 'Everyone', 'own', 'authentic', 'swing', 'according', 'Vance', 'allegory', 'life.The', 'Next', 'Next', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'good', 'looks', 'cool', 'savoir', 'faire', 'often', 'been', 'referred', 'next', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'mind', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'next', 'next', 'Redford', 'Damon', 'smooth', 'silkily', 'slides', 'role', 'Rannalph', 'Judah', 'Nothing', 'unnatural', 'man', 'golden', 'boy', 'believable', 'smile', 'ocean-blue', 'eyes', 'perfect', 'ire', 'underdog', 'golfer', ""1920's.Enjoyable"", 'Storyline', 'Based', 'novel', 'Steven', 'Pressfield', 'director', 'Robert', 'Redford', '1920', 'life', 'vivid', 'imagery', 'golf', 'were', 'opening', 'scene', 'seasoned', 'ace', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Old', 'Hardy', 'Greaves', 'heart', 'attack', 'lying', 'supine', 'rough', 'reminisces', 'childhood', 'including', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'Judah', 'Judah', 'estranged', 'lover', 'Adele', 'Invergordon', 'actress', 'Charlize', 'Theron-who', 'way', 'heinous', 'Georgia', 'accent', 'thus', 'recants', 'tale', 'golf', 'life.Golf', 'Alright', 'end', 'TLBV', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'just', 'pay', 'attention', 'grasp', 'something', 'substantial', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'actors', 'setting', 'Take', 'humor', 'grain', '1920', 'salt', 'rather', 'dated', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'couple', 'hours', 'will', 'find', 'loving', 'game-golf', 'not', 'life']",N/A
526054,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CXI4,Lawyeraau,"[17, 27]","This is a feel good movie, about a young World War I veteran and former golf pro, Randolph Junah (Matt Damon), from Savannah, Georgia, who is inveigled by his former girlfriend (Charlize Theron) to come out of obscurity and retirement to participate in a golf tournament with two legendary golfers, so that she can save her now deceased father's beautiful golf resort, from those salivating to buy it out from under her, during the great depression.Initially, Junah refuses, and the reason for the refusal is that he simply has lost his swing. A Deus Ex Machina now enters in the guise of Bagger Vance, charmingly played by Will Smith. Vance simply appears one night while Junah is out on his lawn trying out his swing. Vance persuades him to enter the tournament and offers to be his caddy. A deal is struck.Junah enters the golf tournament, and as it progresses he gets better. He delves more deeply into himself under the gentle encouragement of Bagger Vance in order to find his &quot;authentic&quot; swing and, ultimately, finds a lot more. This movie does for golf, what &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; did for baseball.The movie is narrated by Jack Lemmon who, as a young boy (J. Michael Moncrief) during the tournament, saw Junah transform himself under the guidance of Bagger Vance. It is the on screen Jack Lemmon who is summoned by Bagger Vance into the sunset at the end of the film. Just who was Bagger Vance? I say he was the proverbial guardian angel. Viewers, however, will differ on just who they think Bagger Vance really was.The flaw in the movie is that it is like a Hallmark Card movie in that it sugarcoats everything and paints the past in a somewhat unrealistic manner. Here, a diverse population is depicted as mingling together in a most collegial fashion. Quite frankly, I doubt that in reality African-Americans found life with Southern Whites to be quite so collegial as depicted in the film. Then again, this is not a movie about race relations, but rather a movie about that which was lost and is now found. A sort of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; theme.Still, this is an entertaining film that is in reality a fable for grownups.

It's more a spiritual film than a film about golf, as it could have been about baseball or some other sport, but golf fit the bill.  As much as I love Matt Damon, I adored Will Smith as his caddy/spiritual teacher. Perfect for the role. Great film, a joyful film.  Whether you play golf or not, you shouldn't miss it.  Jack Lemmon did the beautiful narration and the bit part at the end and I felt his presence made the film even better.That some reviewers and others thought it was a racial film because Will Smith was the angel and teacher, is preposterous imo.  I've watched it many times, and I never even thought about it that way. Must every film have ridiculous action, sex and violence in order to be appreciated these days?  Too bad.It did start getting me interesting in watching golf.  I hurt my back years ago playing golf, and never played again, but I started watching it on television after seeing this film, and followed Tiger Woods for a while.

From the onset, the story is narrated from the perspective of a 10-year old boy. Nothing wrong with that, but honestly, by the time the story kicks in, I haven't really established any kind of attachment with the characters. Trying to sell your house? Who cares? It's the Great Depression; if anything, I felt more sorry for the nameless people trying to get food in line than I did for the people of Savannah, Georgia: &quot;Who's going to play in our golf tournament?&quot;2. Motive. Matt Damon, playing Junuh (sp?), is a completely washed-out shellshocked drunk who, well, just decides to play because he's mixed-up anyway.3. Closure. Honestly, could we build-up some rough dramatic tension? The boy dislikes his father because he feels his job as a sweep is undignified. Well, all it takes is Matt Damon to say, &quot;Why don't you go stand by your father there?&quot; Wow...why couldn't his mother think of that? Wonderful...they're &quot;reunited&quot;. There's nothing more awe-inspiring than Matt being used as a &quot;crutch.&quot; Translation: &quot;You look up to me and not your father. So why don't you stand with your father over there because you value my opinion more than his.&quot; Whew.4. &quot;Magical&quot; golf inspiration. I really did love Will Smith in this movie--no sarcasm intended. I think it's high time that he is cast in a serious role.  Quite honestly, I am looking forward to seeing him in ALI. However, the whispery golf inspiraiton sequences were just a little much...I half-expected Pat Morita to show up in the middle of the multitude of inspirational Will Smith&quot;isms&quot; and say, &quot;Wax on. Wax off.&quot; Or to dissolve slowly into the Shao-Lin temple where Matt Damon originally learned to play.5. Love interest. &quot;I liked how we danced together?!?&quot; I'm sure they could have picked something more poignant and--God forbid--something a little more personal and tied to individuality apart from something that EVERYBODY does.There were elements in the story that I liked, but it all falls down to everybody kind of liking each other, pretending not to, and not establishing any sort of rapport with the audience.

526057,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXI4,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed The Legend of Bagger Vance, but I should tell you that a lot of people, as well as some critics, did not. I suppose I can understand why. A movie that seems to be about golf as a Zen experience isn't likely to excite many viewers. I grew up in a golfing family, and I doubt that any of my uncles, aunts and cousins ever had a Zen encounter. If any of them did, they certainly didn't know what it was. Still, one of the purposes of the movies is to find magic and mysticism in seemingly ordinary things. Field of Dreams did it to baseball while A River Runs Through It brought new meaning to fly fishing.Savannah, Georgia is in the midst of The Great Depression. It ruined the city's richest man, who then killed himself. His daughter, Adele [Charlize Theron], is determined to preserve his last great accomplishment, a magnificent golf course on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. She decides to hold an exhibition match between the then greatest American golfers, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. The city fathers insist that she include a local golfer in the match. They want Rannulph Junuh [Matt Damon], who happens to be Adele's ex-fiance, but Junuh was traumatized in World War I. He gave up Adele and golf and now spends his time drinking and playing poker on his plantation. He laughs at the idea of a comeback, but one night a stranger shows up at his house and offers to be his caddy. The man is Bagger Vance [Will Smith]. He may or may not be a spirit or angel, but whatever he is, he gets Junuh to enter the match and to put him back the path of life he so long ago gave up on.This is one of the most sumptuous and beautiful movies of last year. The cinemaphotography by Michael Ballhaus is stunning. Rachel Portman, one of the best composers working in film today, contributes a lyrical and moving score. Director Robert Redford has a sure hand. He must have known exactly where he wanted the movie to go long before production began. The acting is low-keyed and assured. Will Smith's role is a departure for him, and he makes the most of it. Matt Damon and Charlize Theron are charming.I think two things play against The Legend of Bagger Vance. One is that audiences currently favor movies that are cynical and fast-paced, and this one is positive and somewhat slow. The other is that it revolves around golf, and I can think of no boxoffice hit with that sport as a central character. The truth is that golf is not the subject. Golf is simply a metaphor for the movie's true meaning, which is that while life is anything but fair or kind, it is decidedly worth living.",4,"Liked the movie, and I don't even like golf!",1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,2589,"['enjoyed', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'should', 'tell', 'lot', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'critics', 'did', 'not', 'suppose', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'be', 'about', 'golf', 'Zen', 'experience', ""n't"", 'likely', 'excite', 'many', 'viewers', 'grew', 'up', 'golfing', 'family', 'doubt', 'uncles', 'aunts', 'cousins', 'ever', 'had', 'Zen', 'encounter', 'did', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'Still', 'one', 'purposes', 'movies', 'find', 'magic', 'mysticism', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'things', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'did', 'baseball', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'brought', 'new', 'meaning', 'fly', 'fishing.Savannah', 'Georgia', 'midst', 'Great', 'Depression', 'ruined', 'city', 'richest', 'man', 'who', 'then', 'killed', 'daughter', 'Adele', '[', 'Charlize', 'Theron', ']', 'determined', 'preserve', 'last', 'great', 'accomplishment', 'magnificent', 'golf', 'course', 'shores', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'hold', 'exhibition', 'match', 'then', 'greatest', 'American', 'golfers', 'Bobby', 'Jones', 'Walter', 'Hagen', 'city', 'fathers', 'insist', 'include', 'local', 'golfer', 'match', 'want', 'Rannulph', 'Junuh', '[', 'Matt', 'Damon', ']', 'who', 'be', 'Adele', 'ex-fiance', 'Junuh', 'was', 'traumatized', 'World', 'War', 'gave', 'up', 'Adele', 'golf', 'now', 'time', 'drinking', 'playing', 'poker', 'plantation', 'idea', 'comeback', 'one', 'night', 'stranger', 'up', 'house', 'be', 'caddy', 'man', 'Bagger', 'Vance', '[', 'Will', 'Smith', ']', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'spirit', 'angel', 'Junuh', 'enter', 'match', 'put', 'back', 'path', 'life', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'gave', 'up', 'on.This', 'one', 'most', 'sumptuous', 'beautiful', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'cinemaphotography', 'Michael', 'Ballhaus', 'stunning', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'one', 'best', 'composers', 'working', 'film', 'today', 'lyrical', 'moving', 'score', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'sure', 'hand', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'exactly', 'where', 'wanted', 'movie', 'go', 'long', 'before', 'production', 'began', 'acting', 'low-keyed', 'assured', 'Will', 'Smith', 'role', 'departure', 'most', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'are', 'charming.I', 'think', 'two', 'things', 'play', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'One', 'audiences', 'currently', 'favor', 'movies', 'are', 'cynical', 'fast-paced', 'one', 'positive', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'other', 'golf', 'can', 'think', 'boxoffice', 'hit', 'sport', 'central', 'character', 'truth', 'golf', 'not', 'subject', 'Golf', 'simply', 'metaphor', 'movie', 'true', 'meaning', 'life', 'anything', 'fair', 'kind', 'decidedly', 'worth', 'living']",N/A

It also seems he has lost all of his feeling about everything. In short, it appears that he has lost his faith about his place in this mortal world. Enter Bagger Vance-from seemingly out of nowhere one night, who seems to know Junah very well indeed and quietly guides him back to himself. The Bagger Vance character seems to be a manifestation of God sent to earth to help Junah prevail through his suffering. Junah has clearly suffered enough but doesn't understand this fact, he only feels guilt, which doesn't serve him well. The golf in this movie is fabulous, it's a stirring event. (Golf can be stirring? Who knew?) Good performances by Matt Damon, Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jack Lemmon who is as always, awesome. Check out this movie...it'll leave you feeling very hopeful about life. It will make you think that perhaps there is a bigger, quieter world than we know. If we're paying attention, that is...and it seems like paying attention is not a requitement at all.

Robert Redford has a strong sense of time and character in this study of a war-torn vet who finds his redemption at the hands of a mystical stranger and caddy.  Matt Damon does a fine job as Junuh, a young man who lost all of his men in a WWI battle and has retreated within himself, giving up his love for the game of golf.  Charlize Theron shines as a strong willed Southern belle who arranges a golf tournament featuring Walter Hagen (Bruce Mc Gill) and Bobby Jones (Joel Hertsche) to emerge from the great depression.  A delightful little boy (J. Michael Moncrief) convinces Damon to join in the tourney as a representative of the fine city of Savannah.  A marvelously restrained Will Smith shows up as Bagger Vance, a caddy who seems to have all the right answers for Damon.  The movie is framed by a narrative of a mature Moncrief, wonderfully evoked by Jack Lemmon in his last movie appearance.  The Georgia scenery is breathtaking and Rachel Portman contributes a wonderful score that carefully compliments the film's period.

I've seen it before numerous times. When this first came out on cable, I was able to record it onto a vhs tape. Back then, I loved the romance between Damon and Thereon. But since I've discarded all my vhs stuff, I've only randomly seen this on cable.I am not a golf fan. But Bagger Vance (Will Smith) and old Harvey (Jack Lemmon) do a pretty decent job giving the viewers the 411 on golf without boring me. Sometimes they were even funny. Old Harvey's narration was perfect. Not like those sports announcer voice over in other sport movie... *cough* Wimbledon...I still enjoy the romance between Damon and Thereon. But now, I've come to like his they played their characters. In my opinion, Thereon played the perfect southern woman not to be reckoned with, even when she isn't making any sense. Matt Damon was pretty good at acting as a troubled returning soldier with PTSD and has-been star golf player.Don't know, or cared, if Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones was portrayed correctly. I felt that they were the backdrop to the story.The character that I like now is the boy, Hardy Greaves, who's played by J. Michael Moncrief. He was thr perfect touch of comedy and the child who idolizes his heroes. Re-watching this movie would've been boring without that character.Seeing this again, I also notice the adult humor more.

526078,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,B00003CXI4,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[2, 2]","This movie is adapted from the Steven Pressfield's novel, ""The Legend of Bagger Vance,"" in which the author discusses the metaphysics of Bhagavad-Gita in a golf game setting. The conversation is supposed to be between the war-veteran and a golf champion, R. Junah (named to rhyme with Arjuna) and his caddie Bagger Vance (similar to Bhagavan). In this story, Vance explains the game of golf as a metaphor for the soul's search for its true identity: The search for the ""authentic golf swing"" and the search for the true meaning of life. Junah's feeling of guilt (after witnessing death and destruction in the WWI), the futility of life and Vance's words of encouragement during the game are reminiscent of the teachings of Gita.In the movie, Rannulph Junah (Matt Damon) is asked to play a game of golf with golf-legends Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones in Savannah, GA. Initially he refuses saying that in a world torn apart by conflict, competition to win a game is fruitless. When Vance (Will Smith) offers to be his caddie, he agrees, and during the game, Vance asks Junah a series of questions about his identity intended to promote Juanh's realization of true Self. Vance proclaims his mission is to teach the three paths; action, knowledge, and devotion. For author Pressfield, this story is a contemporary version of Gita, and director Robert Redford was drawn to the mystical dimension portrayed in a golf game and its human experience. The special effects of the movie convey the appreciation of nature and oneness of existence to echo the sentiment of Gita. There are few instances where Gita's message is reminiscent, when Junah rebukes a young boy for being ashamed that his father sweeps the streets, stressing the honor and integrity of his profession. At another instance, Vance corrects Junah that the soul is not dead when the body perishes. During the game, Junah states that an ""eagle"" on this hole will finish the game, but Vance nods disapprovingly, if you do not"" perfect the swing,"" meaning to indicate, you loose, and the cycle of life and death continues.For someone who is not familiar with the teachings of Bhagavad-Gita or Pressfield's novel, they miss the entire metaphysics of the movie, since a significant part of the movie dwells in the love life of Junah and his girlfriend Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron). Junah goes on a journey of temptations that is not in the book, but developed for the screen. Having tackled baseball in the movie, ""The Natural,"" Robert Redford admits during an interview that golf is used in this movie as a metaphor. Redford states that he liked the story of a frustrated and dejected golfer who lost his swing must find an ""authentic swing,"" to get back into the game. This is the same as losing a connection to your soul, losing your rhythm or a stride in life. Golf is the appropriate since it's about a struggle against self. You've got a club, a ball and nature; the greens, the fairways, the wind and light, and the precision and competence and centeredness it takes to have your swing. The film is narrated by Jack Lemmon who also makes a brief appearance as a veteran golf player. As expected, both Matt Damon and Will Smith offer splendid performances and Charlize Theron dazzles as the wealthy girlfriend of Junah.1.The Legend of Bagger Vance: A Novel of Golf and the Game of Life2.The Natural",5,The Gita of Bagger Vance,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3363,"['movie', 'adapted', 'Steven', 'Pressfield', 'novel', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'author', 'metaphysics', 'Bhagavad-Gita', 'golf', 'game', 'setting', 'conversation', 'supposed', 'be', 'war-veteran', 'golf', 'champion', 'R.', 'Junah', 'named', 'rhyme', 'Arjuna', 'caddie', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'similar', 'Bhagavan', 'story', 'Vance', 'game', 'golf', 'metaphor', 'soul', 'search', 'true', 'identity', 'search', 'authentic', 'golf', 'swing', 'search', 'true', 'meaning', 'life', 'Junah', 'feeling', 'guilt', 'witnessing', 'death', 'destruction', 'WWI', 'futility', 'life', 'Vance', 'words', 'encouragement', 'game', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'teachings', 'Gita.In', 'movie', 'Rannulph', 'Junah', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'asked', 'play', 'game', 'golf', 'golf-legends', 'Walter', 'Hagen', 'Bobby', 'Jones', 'Savannah', 'GA', 'Initially', 'saying', 'world', 'torn', 'apart', 'conflict', 'competition', 'win', 'game', 'fruitless', 'When', 'Vance', 'Will', 'Smith', 'be', 'caddie', 'game', 'Vance', 'Junah', 'series', 'questions', 'identity', 'intended', 'promote', 'Juanh', 'realization', 'true', 'Self', 'Vance', 'mission', 'teach', 'three', 'paths', 'action', 'knowledge', 'devotion', 'author', 'Pressfield', 'story', 'contemporary', 'version', 'Gita', 'director', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'was', 'drawn', 'mystical', 'dimension', 'portrayed', 'golf', 'game', 'human', 'experience', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'appreciation', 'nature', 'oneness', 'existence', 'echo', 'sentiment', 'Gita', 'are', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'Gita', 'message', 'reminiscent', 'when', 'Junah', 'young', 'boy', 'being', 'ashamed', 'father', 'streets', 'stressing', 'honor', 'integrity', 'profession', 'instance', 'Vance', 'Junah', 'soul', 'not', 'dead', 'when', 'body', 'perishes', 'game', 'Junah', 'eagle', 'hole', 'will', 'finish', 'game', 'Vance', 'nods', 'disapprovingly', 'do', 'not', 'perfect', 'swing', 'meaning', 'indicate', 'loose', 'cycle', 'life', 'death', 'continues.For', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'familiar', 'teachings', 'Bhagavad-Gita', 'Pressfield', 'novel', 'miss', 'entire', 'metaphysics', 'movie', 'significant', 'part', 'movie', 'love', 'life', 'Junah', 'girlfriend', 'Adele', 'Invergordon', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Junah', 'journey', 'temptations', 'not', 'book', 'developed', 'screen', 'Having', 'tackled', 'baseball', 'movie', 'Natural', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'interview', 'golf', 'used', 'movie', 'metaphor', 'Redford', 'liked', 'story', 'frustrated', 'dejected', 'golfer', 'who', 'lost', 'swing', 'must', 'find', 'authentic', 'swing', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'same', 'losing', 'connection', 'soul', 'losing', 'rhythm', 'stride', 'life', 'Golf', 'appropriate', 'struggle', 'self', ""'ve"", 'got', 'club', 'ball', 'nature', 'greens', 'fairways', 'wind', 'light', 'precision', 'competence', 'centeredness', 'have', 'swing', 'film', 'narrated', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'who', 'also', 'brief', 'appearance', 'veteran', 'golf', 'player', 'expected', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Will', 'Smith', 'offer', 'splendid', 'performances', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'wealthy', 'girlfriend', 'Junah.1.The', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'Novel', 'Golf', 'Game', 'Life2.The', 'Natural']",N/A
526079,AOPQ0KA1B7BFD,B00003CXI4,Ray Gray,"[3, 3]","First, ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is a wonderful story played out on a golf course that beautifully demonstrates the attitude we should have about the challenges we face in our lives.  Second, you do not have to be a golfer to enjoy the movie.  And third, if you are a golfer and buy the movie expecting it to be about golf you'll be disappointed.With golf referenced so many times why the disclaimers?  Golf is a metaphor for Life in many ways and director Robert Redford makes the intellectual life-golf connection without getting lost in golfiness.  One of great appeals of golf is that it is played within an Eden-like setting, yet a typical round is filled with traps, challenges, goals, problem solving, personal errors, and dramatic successes.  Each moment of the game, whether putting or driving, requires focus, yet between each stroke you have time to relax and savor the scenery, just like in life.  Romance, tragedy, recovery, personal failure and rising to overcome challenges are all played out in various ways around the movie's fictional course.The acting and cinematography are first rate.  Charlize Theron is powerfully present, majestically beautiful.  Matt Damon's personal demons are challenged one by one.  Will Smith is wonderfully subdued, demonstrating perfectly that we should face our challenges with an easy smile, anticipating success.An unexpected jewel in the movie is the whimsical narrative by an uncredited Jack Lemmon.  His presence provides a haunting, poignant exclamation to his last movie because Mr Lemmon died the year after the movie was released.  If you loved Jack Lemmon in life you have to own this movie.  Watch the movie and you'll understand why.Although the movie is not available on Blu-ray, don't let that stop you from buying the DVD.  The widescreen version is a 1.85:1 aspect ratio so it fills an HDTV screen.  The DVD transfer is almost as sharp and clear as Blu-ray.

It's a tale of redemption and the indomitable nature of the human spirit.  It's about how the rhythm of golf is the rhythm of life, and so much more.Matt Damon plays Rannulph Junuh, the pride of Savannah and one of the area's best golfers, who returns from World War I shattered and disillusioned from the horrors of war.  He reluctantly competes in a local exhibition golf match against golf legends Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill) to give it some local flavor.  Junuh is estranged from his socialite girlfriend (Charlize Theron), who is sponsoring the tournament to save her late father's golf resort, and idolized by young Hardy (newcomer J. Michael Moncrief, played as an older man by Jack Lemmon) but still not sure of his ability until the mysterious caddie Bagger Vance (Will Smith) comes in and teaches him about golf, life, and redemption.Director Robert Redford manages to extract superb performances from his cast, and despite the fact that Will Smith was billed as the star this picture clearly belongs to Matt Damon, who turns in his best acting performance since Good Will Hunting.The cinematography in this film is spectacular, and Rachel Portman's score is one of the most moving and beautiful I'd heard in a long time.

526084,A3R8GJKIOLRRB4,B00003CXI4,S. Morgan,"[0, 0]","We saw this as a family using Amazon Instant Video. I chose it because I remembered hearing about it but had never seen it at a theater and couldn't remember what the reviews were. However, I liked the ensemble cast and have enjoyed other Robert Redford movies, the trailer was good, and my husband was willing to watch it, too. We are not golfers, but it looked like it was about more than golf, and it was. (I have to admit, though, some of my favorite moments in the movie were the golfing shots. It made me smile to see a middle-aged man in bare feet standing on sand, water all around him, trying to hit a little white ball back to the grass.)We had a good time watching it. I looked at the other reviews after we finished, to get an idea of what other people thought, and found that most people agreed with me. This is a movie that sets out to entertain, and it does the job. I've never seen a Matt Damon movie I didn't like, and Will Smith and Charlize Theron are usually good, too. The plot is pretty light, but it hits the basics: Our Hero has to start at a disadvantage, or it wouldn't be interesting, but he has to improve fast because the tournament is only two days. He has to stumble at least once before the end, to make the end interesting; that happens too. But you do get the happy ending and the promise of a better future, even though not every problem is solved. All that is good. I was not looking for a movie that would leave me discouraged and depressed.One of the reviewers thought that when the narrator (a young boy) was told by Matt Damon's character to go stand by his father, that that was really unbelievable and not well-supported in the movie. Maybe that reviewer went out to get some popcorn and missed the earlier part, in the locker room, when Matt Damon's character explained to the boy exactly why his father was an honorable man who had shown tremendous character in the face of difficult circumstances. He may have also missed the part where Matt Damon's character made it clear that the boy's father was someone who had always been his friend, and was a man he respected still. Personally, I liked that part of the story line, and I thought the criticism was unfair.The movie is set in the south, and you could be forgiven for thinking, based on the movie alone, that racism wasn't much of an issue there. Some people were critical of Will Smith's character; they thought casting him was racist and patronizing. Really? I thought he did a great job, and the idea that anyone could or would look down on him as a choice is surprising to me. I am not exactly sure what he was (although he seems to have been something like an angelic visitor), but he didn't bother me any more than the angel in &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; bothers me. You shouldn't overthink these things too much.The setting is gorgeous (you can't go wrong with a beautiful golf course), the characters were likeable and interesting, the chemistry between the three competing golfers and between Matt and Charlize was good, and I liked the acting. The little boy was a charmer, so earnest and so very, very young. When I checked the Internet, I couldn't see that he's ever been in anything else; that's too bad, because he was really good. Some people didn't like Charlize Theron's accent. I wouldn't recognize a good southern accent if it hit me on the head, so I can't evaluate that, but I liked her.

Most comments on the Internet are negative, but I think they are from younger viewers looking for exploding heads and time-travel alien abductions and such.  Serious critics rated the movie a little better.  I found it entertaining.The film opens with a wealthy businessman from Savannah having passed away with large debts to many parties.  Several businessmen are hounding his daughter, Adel Invergordon (Charlize Theron), to sell them his assets on the cheap, including a golf course he owned.  Instead, to pay her father's debts, she decides to sponsor an exhibition golf between the two greatest golf player in the world, Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill.  She puts up all of her available cash, ten thousand dollars, as prize money.  The business and political leaders of Savannah do not think it would be good idea unless someone from Savannah was also in the exhibition.  The problem is they don't have anyone, that is, until someone remembers Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon).Rannulph was a World War I vet from Savannah who came home from the war with post-traumatic stress syndrome.  Before the war he was a gifted, champion golfer.  Since then he's lost his swing, and now he's an unemployed drunk and card player.  It takes a lot of convincing to get Rannulph to join the exhibition.  I can't blame him since he'd be playing against the two best players in the world.  Out of nowhere, comes a man named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) offering to be his caddy for five dollars.  Bagger Vance is a mysterious, guardian angel type character.  When it comes to golf technique he's totally incompetent, but he's a great coach in the mental aspects of the game, as in self-confidence.  As you can imagine, the whole city of Savannah is rooting for Rannulph.  In times like this of economic disaster, people look for things to celebrate.The story is told through the eyes and memory of an elderly man named Hardy Greaves.  As a ten-year-old in Savannah, Hardy (J. Michael Montcrief) helps convince Rannulph to participate and is an assistant caddy to him.  Rannulph is his hope and his hero, and Hardy believes golf is the greatest thing in the world.  The core of the movie is the interaction among Rannulph, Hardy and Bagger.The movie has the cinematic air of A River Runs Through It, which Robert Redford also directed.  I mean that in a good way, although both movies occasionally flirt with a metaphysical silliness.  The cinematography is great.  The character Bagger Vance doesn't have enough characterization, and that's why the ending lacks sufficient oomph-just like A River Runs Through It lacked that oomph at the end also.  Bagger Vance lacks the mystery and power of other mystery men in movies, like John Coffey, in The Green Mile.  I like the actor Matt Damon, especially after seeing Good Will Hunting, but he looked too young for a burned out, drunken World War I vet in 1931, which is when the movie is set.  I'm being picky.  On the whole it's a nice movie.  It makes me wish I played golf and lived next to the golf course in Savannah.",3,Entertaining,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,3191,"['like', 'golf', 'Savannah', 'movies', 'set', 'great', 'Depression', 'sports', 'general', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'Most', 'comments', 'Internet', 'are', 'negative', 'think', 'are', 'younger', 'viewers', 'looking', 'exploding', 'heads', 'time-travel', 'alien', 'abductions', 'such', 'Serious', 'critics', 'rated', 'movie', 'little', 'better', 'found', 'film', 'opens', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'Savannah', 'having', 'passed', 'away', 'large', 'debts', 'many', 'parties', 'Several', 'businessmen', 'are', 'hounding', 'daughter', 'Adel', 'Invergordon', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'sell', 'assets', 'cheap', 'including', 'golf', 'course', 'owned', 'Instead', 'pay', 'father', 'debts', 'sponsor', 'exhibition', 'golf', 'two', 'greatest', 'golf', 'player', 'world', 'Bobby', 'Jones', 'Joel', 'Gretsch', 'Walter', 'Hagen', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'available', 'cash', 'ten', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'prize', 'money', 'business', 'political', 'leaders', 'Savannah', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'someone', 'Savannah', 'was', 'also', 'exhibition', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anyone', 'someone', 'remembers', 'Rannulph', 'Junuh', 'Matt', 'Damon', '.Rannulph', 'was', 'World', 'War', 'vet', 'Savannah', 'who', 'came', 'home', 'war', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome', 'war', 'was', 'gifted', 'champion', 'golfer', 'then', 'lost', 'swing', 'now', 'unemployed', 'drunk', 'card', 'player', 'lot', 'convincing', 'get', 'Rannulph', 'join', 'exhibition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', ""'d"", 'be', 'playing', 'two', 'best', 'players', 'world', 'nowhere', 'man', 'named', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'Will', 'Smith', 'offering', 'be', 'caddy', 'five', 'dollars', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'mysterious', 'guardian', 'angel', 'type', 'character', 'When', 'golf', 'technique', 'totally', 'incompetent', 'great', 'coach', 'mental', 'aspects', 'game', 'self-confidence', 'can', 'imagine', 'whole', 'city', 'Savannah', 'rooting', 'Rannulph', 'times', 'economic', 'disaster', 'people', 'look', 'things', 'celebrate.The', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'memory', 'elderly', 'man', 'named', 'Hardy', 'Greaves', 'ten-year-old', 'Savannah', 'Hardy', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Montcrief', 'convince', 'Rannulph', 'participate', 'assistant', 'caddy', 'Rannulph', 'hope', 'hero', 'Hardy', 'golf', 'greatest', 'thing', 'world', 'core', 'movie', 'interaction', 'Rannulph', 'Hardy', 'Bagger.The', 'movie', 'cinematic', 'air', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'also', 'directed', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'movies', 'occasionally', 'flirt', 'metaphysical', 'silliness', 'cinematography', 'great', 'character', 'Bagger', 'Vance', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'characterization', 'why', 'ending', 'lacks', 'sufficient', 'oomph-just', 'River', 'Runs', 'lacked', 'oomph', 'end', 'also', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'mystery', 'power', 'other', 'mystery', 'men', 'movies', 'John', 'Coffey', 'Green', 'Mile', 'actor', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'especially', 'seeing', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'looked', 'too', 'young', 'burned', 'out', 'drunken', 'World', 'War', 'vet', '1931', 'when', 'movie', 'set', ""'m"", 'being', 'picky', 'whole', 'nice', 'movie', 'wish', 'played', 'golf', 'lived', 'next', 'golf', 'course', 'Savannah']",N/A

Redford does and excellent job with view of sport as Metaphor for life. Juna has lost his swing which in life terms is his soul and must get it back if he is going to get back in the game. Bagger is a spiritual sage (caddy) of some sort who is there to help him find his way.The cinematography is just breathtaking. The golfcourse looks like the Garden of Eden. I love stories about larger than life characters on a great journey. This is certainly one of them. The movie just makes you feel good about life. I find the score enchanting as it especially enhances the golf scenes. A very pleasing movie indeed. Will Smith does a great job in his untradional dramatic role although he has a few rather humorous parts.The best is Lemmon's ending line as narrator. &quot;Bagger always said it is a game that can't be won only played.

He tells the story of a golfer who turns away from the world after seeing the horrors of the First World War. The story isn't really about the game (a good thing, since golf is nothing more than a good walk wasted). It's about finding one's sense of self, being restored after being broken. Matt Damon is wonderful as the man who's retreated away from the world and slowly has to find his way back. Charlize Theron is ideally cast as his former lover, trying to save her late father's golf course dream in the midst of the recession. Will Smith has an enigmatic wisdom as the supernatural character Bagger Vance. Jack Lemmon narrates the whole thing in his homespun cranky style as an elderly version of the boy who finds himself watching events unfold in his home town.

I thought the World War flashback was a bit breezy for an event that had such numbing ramifications ... Yes, the critic in me has many reservations. However ... I loved the movie and watch it over and over again. I think this is because it is a fairy tale. Realism has no place in this sort of tale.
