As with any T.V. show, not every episode can be brilliant, but the character of Thomas Magnum was so likeable, you could forgive some of the poor plots. The seventh season was supposed to be the last, as Tom Selleck was tired of doing it ( it takes a lot out of you, doing these action shows ), but he was talked into doing one more season ( #8 )AFTER THE SERIES ENDED. I often think it would have been wiser to have left it with the end of the 7th season. The ( then ) final episode so caught me by surprise that I got a little more than emotional over it, I'm embarrased to say.

And he is getting tired to be P.I but therefore you see some episodes that are not on cases he needed to resolve. I saw Kevin Selleck and did and still do not know if that is a real Selleck Family member. But in this episode he is showing you more than the P.I he is :)  for those interested.There is still fraction between him and Carol but she sets him straight like no other  of the characters does. Anyway also on the 7th episode there are episodes that are part 1+2.. I know the televised Magnum P.I staying only With the Glen Larsen and Belisarrio Production which we all would like to see, but,  I Guess Tom wanted us to see Things his way(especially 8th season)? :)  He from that 7th season starts to be a producer  himself more continously in the serie and that what made the last episode here so  remarkably fitting the WHOLE entire 8th season(because of life altering incidence...)- because he was free to produce it as he wish and maybe because the serie is about him, and he wanted to show part of himself-ith Bellisarrio and Glen trailing him, but following him - he was the star producer of that episode... There are other episodes that are good of course but why won't you tune in and see. because there are many surprises in this season. Buck melts Down a bit and smiles, nd in that season  you see Frank Sinatra in a role. among other celebrities.

Taylor ""Free Think'n Country Boy""","[2, 3]","I'm a 50 yr old male, happily married, couple of late teen boys...and I just have a blast watching these DVDs...I have all of them now.  I'm quite an admirer of Mr. Selleck, due to his independent conservative beliefs as well as his views on the 2nd Ammendment. I also gained GREAT respect for him for his handling of the Rosie O. attack he endured!  I also find his cowboy movies are especially terrific examples of his acting ability, great story telling there.  Never payed much attention to Magnum PI in the 80's when on TV, but now with TODAY's TV which is...well... total garbage, this show is a breath of fresh air.  So I thought I'd buy the first season of Magnum, as I recalled it was a pretty good show, plus it has Selleck.  What a great decision.  The whole cast and the way they interact is like a tight family, funny, strong and loyal ties that bind, and is great fun to watch.  You may find that a few episodes (here & there in season 4, 5, 6) are pretty simple (poorly written), BUT the actors tried to work with it and it's still the Magnum PI family.  Buy it, enjoy it and turn OFF modern TV!

1093037,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000TZX5XK,Craig MACKINNON,"[3, 4]","Magnum P.I. was cancelled in this, its seventh season.  Tom Sellick was all set to take up the role of Indiana Jones, the character of Magnum was killed in a warehouse shootout (that's not really giving away a plot point since it happens in the first 5 minutes of the season finale).  I think because of the impending end of the series, the producers ""took off the gloves"" and the result is a poignant and edgy season.  That's not to say that Higgins (and Luthor Gillis) doesn't provide ample comic relief, but the ""serious"" shows are more serious and darker, much to the better for the viewer.  Even when a show is basically a remake of an earlier episode (as is the case with ""Solo FLight,"" a remake of ""Home From the Sea"" from Season 4).So the really good episodes far outnumber the weak episodes, and even the weakest episodes (e.g. those early-season episodes that bring back ""beloved favourite characters"" from previous shows) have some great parts in them.  The most important aspect of the season, however, is the formalisation of the Michelle plotline - in a few episodes we see the relationship between Magnum and his (ex?)wife and daughter play out.  I normally don't like the introduction of small children into an action show or movie, but Michelle's daughter is exceptionally well played and brings the show to a new level of maturity.Another obvious improvement in the shows of this season is the increased production value, or the impression of it.  The shows feel cinematic in scope, using music to bridge acts, mixing up the visual styles, etc.  Everything about the show is taken more seriously in this season than in previous seasons.Anyways, the best shows of the season include:Death and Taxes - sometimes known as the ""Mama"" episode (after the Genesis song that plays throughout).  The first really ""epic"" show of the season.  Magnum is taunted by a serial killer.Little Girl Who - the aforementioned introduction of Michelle's daughter in an ongoing storyline.Paper War - a comedy episode where Higgins and Magnum battle each other through practical jokes.  Victims include the Bridge on the River Kwai model, and Magnum's rubber chicken.  Not quite my favourite Higgins/Magnum battle (that would be the Season 8 episode ""Pleasure Principle""), but probably it's second-best.Novel Connection / Magnum on Ice - the crossover episodes with Murder, She Wrote (the M,SW episode is on the DVD, fortunately).  As different as these two shows are (maybe because they were different), these episodes are very good.  I think the tone is more Murder, She Wrote than Magnum (Higgins is oddly off-character in places, and there are the typical plethora of false leads in a M,SE episode).  Works MUCH better than the Simon and Simon crossover from Season 3.Murder By Night - an alternate reality, B&W; episode with Magnum as Bogart.Solo Flight - even the second time around, this story works.  The writers wisely make it an homage, even having Magnum refer to events in ""Home From the Sea"" and using clips therefrom.Laura - sometimes called the ""Frank Sinatra Episode"" - he plays a NYPD officer on the track of some bailjumpers.  But there's something personal in his crusade.....  I always thought of this as the ""Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"" episode, as it is the second episode featuring a Genesis song this season.Limbo - Magnum is ""killed,"" but his spirit stays in Limbo in order to ""say goodbye"" to his friends (and, presumably, viewers of the show).  Fortunately, there is enough wiggle room to allow him to return for Season 8, which has another series finale which isn't quite as poignant, but still very good.What more is there to say?  There are few extras (other than the Murder, She Wrote crossover episode), but the discs are good quality, and it's always nice to see these shows free of advertisements and syndication cuts.  Well worth the cost for the quality of these episodes.",4,"The last ""Magnum"" season (except for the real last season....)",1226448000,"11 12, 2008",2008,3902,"['Magnum', 'P.I', 'was', 'cancelled', 'seventh', 'season', 'Tom', 'Sellick', 'was', 'set', 'take', 'up', 'role', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'character', 'Magnum', 'was', 'killed', 'warehouse', 'shootout', 'not', 'really', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'point', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'season', 'finale', 'think', 'impending', 'end', 'series', 'producers', 'took', 'off', 'gloves', 'result', 'poignant', 'edgy', 'season', 'not', 'say', 'Higgins', 'Luthor', 'Gillis', ""n't"", 'provide', 'ample', 'comic', 'relief', 'serious', 'shows', 'are', 'more', 'serious', 'darker', 'much', 'better', 'viewer', 'Even', 'when', 'show', 'basically', 'remake', 'earlier', 'episode', 'case', 'Solo', 'FLight', 'remake', 'Home', 'Sea', 'Season', '4', '.So', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'far', 'outnumber', 'weak', 'episodes', 'even', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'e.g', 'early-season', 'episodes', 'bring', 'back', 'beloved', 'favourite', 'characters', 'previous', 'shows', 'have', 'great', 'parts', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'season', 'however', 'formalisation', 'Michelle', 'plotline', 'few', 'episodes', 'see', 'relationship', 'Magnum', 'ex', 'wife', 'daughter', 'play', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'introduction', 'small', 'children', 'action', 'show', 'movie', 'Michelle', 'daughter', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'played', 'show', 'new', 'level', 'maturity.Another', 'obvious', 'improvement', 'shows', 'season', 'increased', 'production', 'value', 'impression', 'shows', 'feel', 'cinematic', 'scope', 'using', 'music', 'bridge', 'acts', 'mixing', 'up', 'visual', 'styles', 'etc', 'Everything', 'show', 'taken', 'more', 'seriously', 'season', 'previous', 'seasons.Anyways', 'best', 'shows', 'season', 'include', 'Death', 'Taxes', 'sometimes', 'known', 'Mama', 'episode', 'Genesis', 'song', 'first', 'really', 'epic', 'show', 'season', 'Magnum', 'taunted', 'serial', 'killer.Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'aforementioned', 'introduction', 'Michelle', 'daughter', 'ongoing', 'storyline.Paper', 'War', 'comedy', 'episode', 'where', 'Higgins', 'Magnum', 'battle', 'other', 'practical', 'jokes', 'Victims', 'include', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'model', 'Magnum', 'rubber', 'chicken', 'Not', 'quite', 'favourite', 'Higgins/Magnum', 'battle', 'would', 'be', 'Season', '8', 'episode', 'Pleasure', 'Principle', 'probably', 'second-best.Novel', 'Connection', '/', 'Magnum', 'Ice', 'crossover', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'M', 'SW', 'episode', 'DVD', 'fortunately', 'As', 'different', 'two', 'shows', 'are', 'maybe', 'were', 'different', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'think', 'tone', 'more', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Magnum', 'Higgins', 'oddly', 'off-character', 'places', 'are', 'typical', 'plethora', 'false', 'leads', 'M', 'SE', 'episode', 'MUCH', 'better', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'crossover', 'Season', '3.Murder', 'Night', 'alternate', 'reality', 'B', 'W', 'episode', 'Magnum', 'Bogart.Solo', 'Flight', 'even', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'story', 'writers', 'wisely', 'make', 'homage', 'even', 'having', 'Magnum', 'refer', 'events', 'Home', 'Sea', 'using', 'clips', 'therefrom.Laura', 'sometimes', 'called', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Episode', 'NYPD', 'officer', 'track', 'bailjumpers', 'something', 'personal', 'crusade', '..', 'always', 'thought', 'Tonight', 'Tonight', 'Tonight', 'episode', 'second', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Genesis', 'song', 'season.Limbo', 'Magnum', 'killed', 'spirit', 'stays', 'Limbo', 'order', 'say', 'goodbye', 'friends', 'presumably', 'viewers', 'show', 'Fortunately', 'enough', 'wiggle', 'room', 'allow', 'return', 'Season', '8', 'series', 'finale', ""n't"", 'quite', 'poignant', 'still', 'very', 'good.What', 'more', 'there', 'say', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'other', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'crossover', 'episode', 'discs', 'are', 'good', 'quality', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'shows', 'free', 'advertisements', 'syndication', 'cuts', 'Well', 'cost', 'quality', 'episodes']",Magnum P.I.: The Complete Seventh Season

Some of the new additions were interesting as well.My complaint is up until the last few episodes you really had no idea this was supposed to be the last season. It didn't wrap up any of the story arcs and many of the new arcs were left hanging. In the finale ""Limbo,"" it felt like a decent season finale cliff hanger, but I have to say if they ended the series on that note I would be really angry.I have no idea how the shortened season 8 will be, but I'm thankful they didn't end the series like this.

1093043,A6A38ESR48ZPK,B000TZX5XK,"grundle2600 ""grundle2600""","[92, 99]","Magnum P.I. is my favorite TV show of all time. It ran for 8 seasons. Season 7 contains some of the very best episodes of the series. Here are the episodes:L.A. - While in Los Angeles to do some work for Robin Masters, Magnum meets Dana Delany. While some fans of the series love this episode, it's never been high on my list. I don't hate it either, but I don't see much special about it. This episode is two hours long.One Picture is Worth - Magnum protects a woman who was a witness to a bank robbery/murder. There's a clich&eacute; scene where Magnum and the woman are hiding in a remote shack, and the bad guys are outside shooting at them, and the shack gets set on fire.Straight and Narrow - A woman whom Magnum had met in the season 6 episode ""The Hotel Dick"" now hires Magnum to find her missing sister.A.A.P.I. - Magnum tries to solve the murder of a famous French detective, who was poisoned at a convention of private investigators. There are also some dream sequences along the lines of 1940s film noir.Death and Taxes - Magnum keeps getting phone calls which are either from a prankster, or from a crazy serial killer. This is one of the better episodes of this season.Little Girl Who - This episode is one of the reasons why season 7 is a must own for fans of the series. This is a continuation of the wonderful ""Memories Are Forever"" from season 2. Just like that episode, this one is emotional, powerful, well written, well acted, and a real tear jerker.Paper War - This is another one of the gems from this season. In one of the funniest episodes of the series, Magnum and Higgins repeatedly up the ante in an ever escalating series of practical jokes against each other. Magnum's mentioning of having an uncle named Otis who worked as an elevator operator is a joke that not everyone will get, but the point of the joke is that there is a real life elevator company named Otis. This is one of the best episodes of the series.Novel Connection - This is the first episode of a two part crossover with ""Murder She Wrote."" I really enjoy the scenes with Angela Lansbury, whose acting performances are always a joy to watch. But the other guest actors are nowhere nearly as interesting.Kapu - After being shot, Magnum wakes up on a small island and is taken care of by the natives.Missing Melody - After 7 seasons, the writers of the show decided that T.C. was divorced and has two children. T.C.'s daughter gets kidnapped. I think the writers must have been pretty desperate for ideas when they wrote this one.Death of the Flowers - Magnum tries to help his friend Carol to find out if a judge is taking bribes.Autumn Warrior - Higgins takes a bunch of teenage juvenile delinquent brats on a survivalist trip into the wilderness.Murder by Night - This is a nice homage to 1940s film noir.On the Fly - This time it's T.C.'s turn to get shot.Solo Flight - While mountain climbing alone, Magnum gets bitten by a centipede, and ends up trapped under the wreckage of an old World War II fighter plane. Magnum has lots of flashbacks, and we see many clips from previous episodes. The guy who played Mr. Roper on ""Three's Company"" also appears.Forty - Magnum celebrates his 40th birthday, and falls in love with a reporter.Laura - Frank Sinatra gives an absolutely wonderful performance - not as a singer, but as a retired police officer. I won't spoil the plot for you. This is a very good episodeOut of Sync - Dana Delaney comes to Hawaii to play the same character that she had played earlier this season.The Aunt Who Came to Dinner - Magnum's aunt comes to visit. Apparently she has Alzheimer's disease. This is about as interesting as those ABC Afterschool Specials.The People vs. Orville Wright - Rick confesses to having committed murder. This is a pretty good episode. But the most important thing is that the ending sets up the beginning of the next episode.Limbo - When it originally aired, this was to be the last episode of the series. This is an extremely moving, emotional episode. I won't spoil the plot for you.

1093048,A3H9PLV6L2S194,B000TZX5XK,Jim Davis,"[1, 1]","The 7th season of Magnum PI follows the pattern of the previous DVD releases - high quality material released in a mediocre package. There are 5 single sided DVDs in the tri-fold arrangement with 2 DVDs on each of 2 folds and 1 on the remaining fold. There is no evidence that any restoration was done on the episodes but fortunately they are recent enough not to require much. Extras are limited to an ""America's Top Sleuths"" feature and a short ""Inside the Ultimate Crime Crossover"" segment. The episodes are not broken up into scenes.I liked season 7 better than season 6. There were fewer mediocre episodes and more real jewels. Here are some good and a few bad impressions.The 2 hour opening episode ""L.A."", although by no means poor, really doesn't hold up when compared to the classic 2 parters of previous seasons. Inexplicably, this episode deleted a minute long chase scene. It isn't glaringly obvious but I got suspicious when a ""girl in hot tub"" was mentioned in the credits but was not on the DVD.The crossover with Murder, She Wrote is indeed an actual crossover. Both casts appear across both parts in a single story. This is in contrast to the earlier Simon and Simon ""crossover"" where there are essentially two separate stories and the Magnum cast's appearances on Simon and Simon is merely gratuitous.Frank Sinatra's last substantial acting role in the episode ""Laura"" is outstanding. He was a superb actor.The worst, but by no means terrible, episode was ""A.A.P.I."".""Missing Melody"" gets trashed because of the out of the blue introduction of T.C.'s ex-wife and children. I always thought this was an unfair criticism. TV shows have to resort to this sort of thing and it is really no worse than finding out that Magnum was once married. If you can get past this, the episode holds up fine.I normally hate the supernatural elements that crept into certain Magnum episodes but ""Limbo"" gets a pass from me. Since it was intended to be a series finale it couldn't really change the tone of the show for the worst. Besides, it was all pulled off superbly. A very touching episode only slightly spoiled by reediting to leave room for Magnum pulling through.Highly recommended to Magnum fans.

1093060,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000TZX5XK,Taheen Lopez,"[2, 2]","It's about time Universal had released this 1986-87 Season of this detective drama starring Tom Selleck as a former Naval Intelligence officer/Vietnam veteran who is now a James Bondish beach-bum style private investigator living in Oahu, Hawaii that ran on CBS from 1980-1988 that consistently ranked in the top 20 US Television programs during the first 5 years of MAGNUM's 8-year run, according to the Nielsen ratings.Additionally, the often indebted Magnum lived & resided in the guest house of a posh 200-acre beach-front estate known as Robin's Nest in Hawaii at the invitation of its owner(Robin Masters)which was the celebrated, but-never-seen author of several dozen lurid novels.Ostensibly this is quid pro quo for Magnum's services based upon Magnum's claimed expertise in security; which the pilot episode ""Don't Eat The Snow In Hawaii"" suggests Magnum also did Robin Masters a favor of some kind.Robin's Nest was guarded by 2 highly trained Doberman Pinschers named Zeus & Apollo and other aspects of the estate were managed by the often exasperated Englishman Jonathan Quayle Higgins III(John Hillerman) whom was an ex-British Army Sgt. Major with whom often as humorous aside during various episodes of the series.Magnum also had to barter for the use of estate amenities other than the guest house & the Ferrari 308 GTS, the tennis courts, wine cellar, expensive cameras, etc.During the early seasons of MAGNUM, PI; the voice of Robin Masters heard only a few times was voiced by Orson Welles which therefore led to a recurrent theme throughout the last 2 seasons of this show involving Magnum suspecting Higgins to be the actual Robin Masters leaving the possibility to be contradictory to numerous references throughout the series' run that made it clear they were 2 different people, especially in the ""Paper War"" episode when Magnum gets stuck in an elevator with Higgins in a building that was about to be demolished.In spite of this, Higgins' dual identity remained an open question until the series finale episode ""Resolutions"" when Higgins first admits that he is Robin Masters, but then later suggests what he had confessed to Magnum about Robin Masters was a lie. Magnum seemingly lived a dream lifestyle since he would come & go as he pleased, worked only when he wanted to, had the almost unlimited use of the Ferrari as well many other Robin Masters' luxuries. Magnum also kept a mini-fridge with a seemingly endless supply of beer, wore his fathers treasured Rolex GMT Master wristwatch, was seemingly surrounded by countless beautiful women whom were often clients or victims of Magnum's in the cases he solved & enjoyed adventures with his old Navy buddies T.C.(Roger Mosley)and Rick ""Orville"" Wright(Larry Mannetti)that he served in Vietnam with who both had a love/hate relationship with Magnum.As a matter of fact at the end of this 1986-87 Season; Magnum was supposedly killed off & this season was supposed to be the end of this series, but there was an outcry from fans back in the Spring of 1987 and an 8th Season was produced to bring Magnum 'back to life' in the Fall of 1987 and to round the series off as MAGNUM's final season in the Spring of 1988, despite the fact that Selleck seemed to already be getting tired and running out of steam by the time this season was underway along with the fact that the last 3 seasons seemed to have gotten more & more serious & less hilarious, including this 1986-1987 Season since Magnum wasn't doing his swims on the beach anymore on his leisure-time like he did a lot in the first 3 seasons and was playing more & more sports for his past-time instead, especially baseball and basketball with T.C. and Rick.In addition, this 1986-87 Season clearly indicated that MAGNUM was obviously no longer in its honeymoon phase of the show anymore either on top of that, despite the fact that MAGNUM, P.I. outlasted most other private detective shows, including its rival show MATT HOUSTON with Lee Horsley & Pamela Hensley which I think was a better detective show since Magnum(Tom Selleck) was always broke & indebted to people and Houston(Lee Horsley)never was since Houston was a filthy-rich playboy that lived high on the hog in a ritzy mansion in L.A. who was a lot more fortunate, a lot tougher, a lot huskier, a lot more organized than Magnum ever was, plus Houston only did detective work on the side as a hobby, unlike Magnum who was just a beach-bum private dick who lived on a shoe-string budget which made MATT HOUSTON like a rich-mans MAGNUM.As a matter of fact Lee Horsley used to get teased a lot by people asking him if he was trying to copy Tom Selleck during MATT HOUSTON's whole 3-year run on ABC since Horsley and Selleck obviously had a slight resemblence along with the fact that MATT HOUSTON was probably inspired by MAGNUM since MATT HOUSTON didn't even come out until MAGNUM, P.I. was in its 3rd Season on CBS since MATT HOUSTON didn't make its debut on ABC until Sunday September 26, 1982 which was 2 years after MAGNUM made its debut on CBS on Thursday December 11, 1980 which was a year after NBC had cancelled the ROCKFORD FILES back in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner developing chronic back & knee problems.In fact, the premiere of MAGNUM, PI was inspired by the ROCKFORD FILES & it just so happens that Tom Selleck had a couple of guest starring appearances in the last 2 seasons of Rockford as the impeccable gumshoe(Lance White)in the episodes ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" and the""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" which were the days before Selleck was even famous since MAGNUM is what made him a star.This is also the season when Shavar Ross known for his role as Arnold's best buddy(Dudley)on DIFFERENT STROKES joins the cast as T.C.'s estranged distant son(Bryant).This 1986-1987 Season also has some interesting guest stars like*Joe Santos in the episodes ""Laura"" and ""Death & Taxes"" after his co-starring days as Jim Rockford's often overwhelmed cop buddy(Det. Dennis Becker)from the LAPD on the ROCKFORD FILES*Angela Lansbury co-starring as novelist Jessica Fletcher from MURDER SHE WROTE in the crossover episode ""The Novel Connection"".*The late great Frank Sinatra in the ""Laura"" episode*Ken Tigar in the ""Death & Taxes"" episode before his co-starring days on DALLAS, DYNASTY, and DAYS OF OUR LIVES*James Luisi in the ""Forty"" episode after his co-starring days as Jim Rockford's disgruntled nemesis(Lt. Doug Chapman)on THE ROCKFORD FILES and before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES & ANOTHER WORLD*Steven Keats in the ""Laura"" episode before his co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDREN and ANOTHER WORLD*Jared Martin in ""The Novel Connection"" episode after his co-starring days on DALLAS*Joan McMurtry in the ""Laura"" episode before her co-starring days as Rick & AJ Simon's foxy cop buddy(Lt. Abigail Marsh)in the last 2 seasons of SIMON & SIMON*Norman Fell in the ""Solo Flight"" episode after his co-starring days as Mr. Roper on THREE'S COMPANY*Gary Frank in the ""Death & Taxes"" episode after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITALThe only thing I don't like about this 1986-1987 Season of MAGNUM, P.I. DVD is they didn't provide a summary index with each episodes original air-date on this DVD unlike the first 3 season DVD box sets of MAGNUM did, which made them easier to work with and made it more interesting along with the fact that this DVD box set didn't even provide the episodes original air-dates on the package by the listing of each episode either, unlike Warner Bros. did for all the WONDER WOMAN and DUKES OF HAZZARD DVD box sets.For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1986-87 Season episodes on CBS were10/1/86: L.A.10/8/86: ONE PICTURE IS WORTH10/15/86: STRAIGHT & NARROW10/22/86: A.A.P.I.10/29/86: DEATH & TAXES11/5/86: LITTLE GIRL WHO11/12/86: PAPER WAR11/19/86: NOVEL CONNECTION11/26/86: KAPU12/3/86: MISSING MELODY12/10/86: DEATH OF THE FLOWERS12/17/86: AUTUMN WARRIORS1/14/87: MURDER BY NIGHT1/21/87: ON THE FLY2/4/87: SOLO FLIGHT2/11/87: FORTY2/25/87: LAURA3/11/87: OUT OF SYNC3/18/87: THE AUNT WHO CAME TO DINNER4/1/87: THE PEOPLE VS. ORVILLE WRIGHT4/15/87: LIMBOOn the other hand, it's nice being able to watch all these Seventh Season episodes complete & uncut without all those deleted scenes & additional commercial interruptions in between that we used to get when MAGNUM was on COZY-TV, WGN, USA, and A&E; to allot more time for commercials, plus it's nice that all these episodes were all put on Single-sided discs instead of Double-sided discs to prevent freezing & skipping as opposed to all the flaws we got on the first 4 seasons of MAGNUM which froze & skipped frequently, but fortunately that didn't happen on this DVD box set.This 1986-87 Season of MANGUM also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when CBS's motto was ""Share The Spirit"" on CBS which was when I was 14 years old in the 8th grade in my hometown(El Centro).So now that Universal has all 8 seasons of MAGNUM released out on DVD, I'm hoping it will inspire Warner Bros. or Paramount to finally release the last 2 seasons of MATT HOUSTON out on DVD soon since MATT HOUSTON was also a very popular detective drama like MAGNUM, THE ROCKFORD FILES, SIMON & SIMON, and MANNIX all were.",5,The Season that should've been the
