1015838,AOB5695UUUJ0,B000HT386W,"Anime Lover ""D""","[0, 0]","I enjoyed the first series, Please Teacher so that is why I watched this series.  The events here offically start when Mizuho first appeared on this planet.  when three people see a house on a news cast of a UFO sighting, it is the beginning of a very interesting story.  Miku works as a computer programmer, and goes to the same high school as Kei Kusinagi.  He is an orphan with unusual blue eyes, and a picture with him and a little girl.  But when two young ladies arrive, they not only have the same eyes, but also the same photos which leaves a question, who is related and who is a stranger?  AS the three live together, the two girls form an alliance in order to determine who is family and who is the stranger, keep other girls away from Miku, and when they find out who the sister is, support the romance between the other girl and Miku.  But when a chance discovery brings the truth to light, can the alliance hold up?While the story is good, there are a few things I did not like.  The made Miss Kasimi (the alien from Onegai Teacher) and airhead, and Mantagu a complete freak (even more so than the first time).  But I enjoyed Ichigo's complete turnaround from a shy young lady to the most informed person on the campus (heh heh heh), and that at least everyone from the first movie makes a small appearance.  When this came out there was a book bassed on the anime (unlike Teacher which had a book and manga), and while they changed some parts of the ending (the person who is the relative is the same, but who MIku chooses to love....wellllll) they still kept to the spirit of the series.  OF course there was supposed to be a third series (Please Friend) but it never made it to production.  Overall a good series and a Anime Legend in its own right.",5,Onegai more please,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,1766,"['enjoyed', 'first', 'series', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'why', 'watched', 'series', 'events', 'here', 'offically', 'start', 'when', 'Mizuho', 'first', 'appeared', 'planet', 'when', 'three', 'people', 'see', 'house', 'news', 'cast', 'UFO', 'sighting', 'beginning', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'Miku', 'computer', 'programmer', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'Kei', 'Kusinagi', 'orphan', 'unusual', 'blue', 'eyes', 'picture', 'little', 'girl', 'when', 'two', 'young', 'ladies', 'arrive', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'same', 'eyes', 'also', 'same', 'photos', 'question', 'who', 'related', 'who', 'stranger', 'three', 'live', 'together', 'two', 'girls', 'form', 'alliance', 'order', 'determine', 'who', 'family', 'who', 'stranger', 'keep', 'other', 'girls', 'away', 'Miku', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'sister', 'support', 'romance', 'other', 'girl', 'Miku', 'when', 'chance', 'discovery', 'truth', 'light', 'can', 'alliance', 'hold', 'up', 'story', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'made', 'Miss', 'Kasimi', 'alien', 'Onegai', 'Teacher', 'airhead', 'Mantagu', 'complete', 'freak', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'first', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'Ichigo', 'complete', 'turnaround', 'shy', 'young', 'lady', 'most', 'informed', 'person', 'campus', 'heh', 'heh', 'heh', 'least', 'everyone', 'first', 'movie', 'small', 'appearance', 'When', 'came', 'out', 'there', 'was', 'book', 'bassed', 'anime', 'Teacher', 'had', 'book', 'manga', 'changed', 'parts', 'ending', 'person', 'who', 'relative', 'same', 'who', 'MIku', 'love', 'still', 'kept', 'spirit', 'series', 'course', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'third', 'series', 'Please', 'Friend', 'never', 'made', 'production', 'Overall', 'good', 'series', 'Anime', 'Legend', 'own', 'right']",N/A

After a long time, Maiku left the orphanage to live on his own in the house in the picture. Maiku works as a programmer in order to pay the rent and goes to the same high school the ""Teacher"" cast goes to. One day, a girl named Mina arrives at his doorstep with the same photo. She then asked Maiku if she can since they were twins, but Maiku didn't know what to do. In the middle of all the confusion, another girl named Kaden shows up with the same photo.

I loved it too, so that is all I will say on that.This anime is a really artistic way of saying home is where you choose to make it. It is a wonderful anime that speaks volumes of teenage angst, wanting to belong, and what it takes to make a true home for yourself in the world.I think the last episode (kinda like a hidden music track on a CD) was a really nice surprise. The second to the last episode is announced as the ""last episode"". Then the credits roll and there is a VERY risque ""final episode"" after the ""last episode"" which is very enjoyable both in humor and suggestive content.There is a lot of fan service in this but it is actually tastefully done. My delicate sensibilities weren't offended and I thought it was almost a sincere act of moving the story along (almost).This is funny material too. Especially when you put yourself in the position of our hero. He is a young man trying to make it on his own steam and not one, but two hotties enter his life. The sudden nose bleeds are timed well and laugh out loud funny.There are plenty of unexpected twists that keep the content interesting even when the initial excitement of the opening episodes wears off.This is worth your money if you enjoyed that time in your life when you were anxious to get closer to someone in your life but were scared to. Almost like a drawn out dating experience... you want it... but aren't sure you can have it... so you're patient but anxious all at the same time... It is a great cocktail of emotions that get drawn from you watching this one.Good stuff, pick it up, you won't be disappointed.",5,Warm Fuzzies all over this...,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,1646,"['Everyone', 'else', 'here', 'referenced', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'loved', 'too', 'will', 'say', 'that.This', 'anime', 'really', 'artistic', 'way', 'saying', 'home', 'where', 'choose', 'make', 'wonderful', 'anime', 'volumes', 'teenage', 'angst', 'wanting', 'belong', 'what', 'make', 'true', 'home', 'world.I', 'think', 'last', 'episode', 'kinda', 'hidden', 'music', 'track', 'CD', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'surprise', 'second', 'last', 'episode', 'announced', 'last', 'episode', 'Then', 'credits', 'roll', 'VERY', 'risque', 'final', 'episode', 'last', 'episode', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'humor', 'suggestive', 'content.There', 'lot', 'fan', 'service', 'actually', 'tastefully', 'done', 'delicate', 'sensibilities', 'were', ""n't"", 'offended', 'thought', 'was', 'almost', 'sincere', 'act', 'moving', 'story', 'almost', '.This', 'funny', 'material', 'too', 'Especially', 'when', 'put', 'position', 'hero', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'make', 'own', 'steam', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'hotties', 'enter', 'life', 'sudden', 'nose', 'bleeds', 'are', 'timed', 'well', 'out', 'loud', 'are', 'plenty', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'keep', 'content', 'interesting', 'even', 'when', 'initial', 'excitement', 'opening', 'wears', 'money', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'were', 'anxious', 'get', 'closer', 'someone', 'life', 'were', 'scared', 'Almost', 'drawn', 'out', 'dating', 'experience', 'want', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'can', 'have', 'so', ""'re"", 'patient', 'anxious', 'same', 'time', 'great', 'cocktail', 'emotions', 'get', 'drawn', 'watching', 'one.Good', 'stuff', 'pick', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

They are all orphans, they have the same photo of them as children, and 2 of them are twins. After seeing a news report they recognize the background on TV as the background of the photograph. The photograph is the only clue to their past and the identity of their twin. The 3 begin to live together in the same house and try to unlock the secrets of their childhood. Karin and Mina both fall in love with Mike. But only 1 of them will get to be his lover, since the other is his twin sister. Which of these 2 girls will get to be with her first love; and which of them has to hide her feelings and play the role of the loving sister. Either way hearts will be broken and love will conquer all.I love this series. It is the sequel to the Please Teacher series. Some of the characters return in the Twins series, but the plot is totally original. The animation and voice acting are very good. You will recognize Johnny Yong Bosch from Bleach and Eureka Seven. He plays Mike in this anime. The story is very touching and also quite funny. It has a few awkward moments considering that the 2 girls in love with Mike may be his sisters. But I can see that happening if you just met someone for the first time in 16 years, and you're not even sure if it's the truth or not. This anime has no flaws that I can think of.

But know that almost if not every episode includes lots of footage of the two main girls conversing together who are underage if not prepubescent completely nude in a bathing situation. Some situations including sexual references for humor's sake. While in no way would I call this pornography or even child pornography, I am not a lawyer and do not know where the line is drawn. I can see how in a legal situation someone in the United States could argue it as such. Just a fair warning. Beyond that, I am a 31 year old male with a pretty open mind but I felt very uncomfortable watching the show.Beyond the repetitive bathing scenes there is a lot of other repetition. You get to hear the main characters say that ""they might be relatives, but they might not"" about three times and episode, which gets old (yeah, we get it). Overall, the show is nothing special except perhaps for its creepy shock value. It certainly ended with me not wanting more.",2,Creepy and monotonous,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,1645,"['bought', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'series', 'whim', 'kind', 'enjoy', 'eccentric', 'anime', 'romance', 'comedies', 'lucked', 'out', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'Having', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'Please', 'Twins', 'series', 'not', 'good.The', 'main', 'plot', 'kind', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'characters', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'fair', 'bit', 'nice', 'also', 'place', 'same', 'town', 'ways', 'favorite', 'character', 'main', 'problem', 'show', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'amount', 'footage', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'naked', 'Now', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'argue', 'acceptable', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'not', 'normal', 'Perhaps', 'know', 'almost', 'not', 'episode', 'lots', 'footage', 'two', 'main', 'girls', 'conversing', 'together', 'who', 'are', 'underage', 'not', 'prepubescent', 'completely', 'nude', 'bathing', 'situation', 'situations', 'including', 'sexual', 'references', 'humor', 'sake', 'way', 'would', 'call', 'pornography', 'even', 'child', 'pornography', 'am', 'not', 'lawyer', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'line', 'drawn', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'legal', 'situation', 'someone', 'United', 'States', 'could', 'argue', 'such', 'Just', 'fair', 'warning', 'Beyond', 'am', '31', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'pretty', 'open', 'mind', 'felt', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'show.Beyond', 'repetitive', 'bathing', 'scenes', 'lot', 'other', 'repetition', 'get', 'hear', 'main', 'characters', 'say', 'might', 'be', 'relatives', 'might', 'not', 'three', 'times', 'episode', 'old', 'yeah', 'get', 'Overall', 'show', 'nothing', 'special', 'perhaps', 'creepy', 'shock', 'value', 'certainly', 'ended', 'not', 'wanting', 'more']",N/A
1015853,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000HT386W,trashcanman,"[63, 64]","After the success of the impeccably put together ""Please Teacher!"" romantic anime series, it would have been very easy for these folks to simply produce another season of that show filled with the episodic, predictable predicaments relying on running gags that so many other anime series use.  But, the studio kept with the theme of ""Please Teacher!"" and continued moving forward, and ""Please Twins!"" is the result.  And although watching ""Teacher"" before this series will increase your enjoyment of it, it isn't really a necessity as this one stands on it's own two feet just fine.  Now, onto the plot: picking up a year and a half after the ending of ""Teacher"" we are introduced to our three twins in question.  You read that right: three twins.  Self-made man Maiku, fiery Miina, and demure Karen all show up at the same house with the same childhood photo showing them and their only sibling, the same eye color, and the same story of childhood abandonment.  That is to say that one of the girls is Maiku's twin sister, and the other is not.  The question quickly becomes which is which?  The plot thickens when both girls fall in love with their possible brother.  Icky?  Yeah, but any anime veteran knows that this kind of implied incest is pretty much par for the course in this genre.  Plus, it's comic gold.  That is, if you have kind of a sick sense of humor. (ahem) Needless to say, this show opts to push the bounds far past the levels of inappropriateness that ""Teacher"" went to.  This turns out to be a good thing as the humor in ""Twins"" is raucous and thoroughly enjoyable throughout.  My favorite episode, for example, focuses on rumors that Maiku is in a homosexual relationship with a fellow student, so the girls put him to the test to see if he really is gay.  The results are more than a little bit amusing.  Not to be forgotten, the fantastic cast of ""Please Teacher!"" play supporting roles, most prominently the teacher herself, Mizuho Kazami, a beloved anime girl if ever there was one.  In fact, she shows up so often that it leads a main character to wonder aloud whether there are even any other teachers at the school.  But the best returning character by far is Ichigo Morino, the little girl who shared Kei's disease in ""Teacher"" which causes her to go into a state of suspended animation (or ""standstill"") when she loses the will to move forward with her own life.  Morino is now a devious class president with an evil little chuckle and a full-time hobby involving surveillance of her classmates and taking inappropriate pictures of them.  Shidou, on the other hand, has been relegated to uber-loser status this time around, becoming a one-note joke about lusting after his underage sister.  As if there wasn't enough incest in the show already, sheesh.  Despite the fact that this show is populated by characters from it's predecessor, it shares little in common with ""Teacher"" on the surface.  Still, the creators manage to put together another fine romantic comedy series that ends too soon, continually evolves and moves forward, and keeps you both entertained and rivetted.  The ending is a suprisingly definitive one, but it doesn't stop there.  After the initial 12-episode run, we are again treated to a bonus episode that acts as a coda to the series.  The plot involves Morino organizing an impromptu summer camp where the entire casts of both series get together for a great send-off to two of the best romantic-comedy animes out there.  It's also fun to see the huge shift in the dynamics of the relationship between the three ""twins"" following the events of the television show.  Faithful to the philosphy presented in both series, the show never stops accelerating, even at the end.  If you saw the first series and want more ""Teacher"", or if you thought that series was too tame then this is as good as it gets.  But if you are looking for some family-friendly entertainment to share with the kids, maybe you oughtta look elsewhere.",5,A worthy follow-up to an anime classic,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,3979,"['success', 'impeccably', 'put', 'together', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'romantic', 'anime', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'folks', 'simply', 'produce', 'season', 'show', 'filled', 'episodic', 'predictable', 'predicaments', 'relying', 'running', 'gags', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'anime', 'series', 'use', 'studio', 'kept', 'theme', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'continued', 'moving', 'forward', 'Please', 'result', 'watching', 'Teacher', 'series', 'will', 'increase', 'enjoyment', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessity', 'one', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'just', 'fine', 'Now', 'plot', 'picking', 'up', 'year', 'half', 'ending', 'Teacher', 'are', 'introduced', 'three', 'twins', 'question', 'read', 'right', 'three', 'twins', 'Self-made', 'man', 'Maiku', 'fiery', 'Miina', 'demure', 'Karen', 'show', 'up', 'same', 'house', 'same', 'childhood', 'photo', 'showing', 'only', 'sibling', 'same', 'eye', 'color', 'same', 'story', 'childhood', 'abandonment', 'say', 'one', 'girls', 'Maiku', 'twin', 'sister', 'other', 'not', 'question', 'quickly', 'plot', 'when', 'girls', 'fall', 'love', 'possible', 'brother', 'Icky', 'Yeah', 'anime', 'veteran', 'kind', 'implied', 'incest', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'course', 'genre', 'comic', 'gold', 'have', 'kind', 'sick', 'sense', 'humor', 'ahem', 'Needless', 'say', 'show', 'push', 'bounds', 'far', 'levels', 'inappropriateness', 'Teacher', 'went', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'humor', 'Twins', 'raucous', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'favorite', 'episode', 'example', 'rumors', 'Maiku', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'fellow', 'student', 'girls', 'put', 'test', 'see', 'really', 'gay', 'results', 'are', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'amusing', 'Not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'play', 'supporting', 'roles', 'most', 'prominently', 'teacher', 'Mizuho', 'Kazami', 'beloved', 'anime', 'girl', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'fact', 'up', 'so', 'often', 'main', 'character', 'wonder', 'aloud', 'are', 'even', 'other', 'teachers', 'school', 'best', 'returning', 'character', 'far', 'Ichigo', 'Morino', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'shared', 'Kei', 'disease', 'Teacher', 'go', 'state', 'suspended', 'animation', 'standstill', 'when', 'will', 'move', 'forward', 'own', 'life', 'Morino', 'now', 'devious', 'class', 'president', 'evil', 'little', 'chuckle', 'full-time', 'hobby', 'involving', 'surveillance', 'classmates', 'taking', 'inappropriate', 'pictures', 'Shidou', 'other', 'hand', 'been', 'relegated', 'uber-loser', 'status', 'time', 'around', 'becoming', 'one-note', 'joke', 'lusting', 'underage', 'sister', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'incest', 'show', 'already', 'sheesh', 'fact', 'show', 'populated', 'characters', 'predecessor', 'shares', 'little', 'common', 'Teacher', 'surface', 'Still', 'creators', 'manage', 'put', 'together', 'fine', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'series', 'too', 'soon', 'continually', 'evolves', 'moves', 'forward', 'entertained', 'rivetted', 'ending', 'suprisingly', 'definitive', 'one', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'initial', '12-episode', 'run', 'are', 'again', 'treated', 'bonus', 'episode', 'coda', 'series', 'plot', 'Morino', 'organizing', 'impromptu', 'summer', 'camp', 'where', 'entire', 'casts', 'series', 'get', 'together', 'great', 'send-off', 'two', 'best', 'romantic-comedy', 'animes', 'out', 'there', 'also', 'fun', 'see', 'huge', 'shift', 'dynamics', 'relationship', 'three', 'twins', 'following', 'events', 'television', 'show', 'Faithful', 'philosphy', 'presented', 'series', 'show', 'never', 'accelerating', 'even', 'end', 'saw', 'first', 'series', 'want', 'more', 'Teacher', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'too', 'tame', 'then', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'looking', 'family-friendly', 'entertainment', 'share', 'kids', 'maybe', 'oughtta', 'look', 'elsewhere']",N/A
