1056716,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000NIVJF4,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[16, 21]","The first thing that strikes me about 'The Last King of Scotland' is that it is such a rewarding movie to watch.  Thinking it would be a politically correct history lesson, I was happy to find it has a compelling story, as well as a striking portrayal.  While recent nominee, Forest Whitaker, as the self-titled bloody dictator, Idi Amin, has been justly heralded, the whole movie is effective and includes other fine performances.It all starts in 1970 in Scotland where Nicholas Garrigan (James Mc Avoy--remember him as Mr. Tumnus in 'Narnia'?) becomes a doctor with glowing admiration from his doctor father.  Rebelling against the mold as many of his generation, he spins the globe to give himself the fate of going to Uganda.  There he immediately makes a big impression, even at first making a dent at the local clinic.  He's come at a crucial time when a military general has taken over the government.  He and his love interest, Sarah (Gillian Anderson), go to one of Amin's speeches.  They leave early, but are diverted to meet the charismatic leader after he has hurt his hand in an auto accident.  Helpful from the first, Nicholas is summoned to become Amin's personal physician.  He declines at first, wanting to be the humanitarian he came to be, but, after a party and a series of assignments, he can no longer refuse.  Amin was a polygamist with many children from each wife. After healing a boy after an epileptic fit, Nicholas becomes a top aide.What's so effective about how director Kevin Mc Donald unfolds the story is that, even knowing Amin's history, the brutal nature of his bloody regime reveals itself as if for the first time.  McAvoy's performance puts us in the driver's seat, and from there we get conflicting evidence.  There's a harrowing scene as Amin's enemies fire at Nicholas and the tyrant in Nich's newly acquired car.  Then, there's the nature of Amin himself.  He is so funny and affable--such a likable host, we briefly forget that he's a dictator.  In one scene he has a double as himself play a practical joke on Nicholas.  (The jokes are more unnerving than his temperamental side, for it has us holding our breath for the other shoe to drop.)  His generosity toward Nicholas make him seem so human.  That is until we start to see his paranoid and fickle side slowly develop.  In the meantime, Nicholas is approached by a British official, Nigel (Simon McBurney), who seems to be steeped in his own self-interest...even though eventual mounting evidence supports his claims.  He also develops a dangerous alliance with Kay (Kerry Washington), one of Amin's wives.  Between his slowly growing knowledge and some unmentioned missteps, Nicholas is sitting on a ticking time bomb.  Harrowing, but more thoughtful than most chase movies, 'The Last King of Scotland' is a sharp and skillful reinenactment of a dark chapter of history.",5,Bloody Strange,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,2871,"['first', 'thing', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'such', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'watch', 'Thinking', 'would', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'history', 'lesson', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'compelling', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'striking', 'portrayal', 'recent', 'nominee', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'self-titled', 'bloody', 'dictator', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'been', 'justly', 'heralded', 'whole', 'movie', 'effective', 'other', 'fine', 'starts', '1970', 'Scotland', 'where', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'James', 'Mc', 'Avoy', 'remember', 'Mr.', 'Tumnus', ""'Narnia"", 'doctor', 'glowing', 'admiration', 'doctor', 'father', 'Rebelling', 'mold', 'many', 'generation', 'globe', 'give', 'fate', 'going', 'Uganda', 'immediately', 'big', 'impression', 'even', 'first', 'making', 'dent', 'local', 'clinic', 'come', 'crucial', 'time', 'when', 'military', 'general', 'taken', 'government', 'love', 'interest', 'Sarah', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'go', 'one', 'Amin', 'speeches', 'leave', 'early', 'are', 'diverted', 'meet', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'hurt', 'hand', 'auto', 'accident', 'first', 'Nicholas', 'summoned', 'become', 'Amin', 'personal', 'physician', 'first', 'wanting', 'be', 'humanitarian', 'came', 'be', 'party', 'series', 'assignments', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'refuse', 'Amin', 'was', 'polygamist', 'many', 'children', 'wife', 'healing', 'boy', 'epileptic', 'fit', 'Nicholas', 'top', 'aide.What', 'so', 'effective', 'how', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Mc', 'Donald', 'story', 'even', 'knowing', 'Amin', 'history', 'brutal', 'nature', 'bloody', 'regime', 'first', 'time', 'McAvoy', 'performance', 'driver', 'seat', 'get', 'conflicting', 'evidence', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'Amin', 'enemies', 'fire', 'Nicholas', 'tyrant', 'Nich', 'newly', 'acquired', 'car', 'Then', 'nature', 'Amin', 'so', 'funny', 'affable', 'such', 'likable', 'host', 'briefly', 'forget', 'dictator', 'one', 'scene', 'double', 'play', 'practical', 'joke', 'Nicholas', 'jokes', 'are', 'more', 'unnerving', 'temperamental', 'side', 'holding', 'breath', 'other', 'shoe', 'drop', 'generosity', 'Nicholas', 'make', 'seem', 'so', 'human', 'start', 'see', 'paranoid', 'fickle', 'side', 'slowly', 'develop', 'meantime', 'Nicholas', 'approached', 'British', 'official', 'Nigel', 'Simon', 'McBurney', 'who', 'be', 'steeped', 'own', 'self-interest', 'even', 'eventual', 'mounting', 'evidence', 'supports', 'claims', 'also', 'dangerous', 'alliance', 'Kay', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'one', 'Amin', 'wives', 'Between', 'slowly', 'growing', 'knowledge', 'unmentioned', 'missteps', 'Nicholas', 'sitting', 'ticking', 'time', 'bomb', 'Harrowing', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'most', 'chase', 'movies', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'sharp', 'skillful', 'reinenactment', 'dark', 'chapter', 'history']",N/A

I listened to the commentary, that's how I know. Please leave our breasts alone! It doesn't make the movie interesting. What's the point?On a lighter note, great story, great actors, and great acting but there is a particular love scene that did not need to be there 'cause it was too bold. I have never seen somebody's hands being put in the area of the legs and vice versa. This part was also not necessary. I love how fond of the caucasian doctor Idi Amin is. It is a bit scary, but it's funny. He escapes because of 'white' privilege; it's not fair. I gave it three stars not because it's okay for Kevin to show breasts generously, but because of the relationship between Idi Amin and the doctor and I thought Kerry Washington was great as an African woman.

1056719,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000NIVJF4,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 3]","What you notice most about The Last King Of Scotland is excellent cinematography, the recreation of Uganda in the 1970's is lovingly crafted and convincing, from the interior decor to the music to the colorful clothing and culture clash of western influence with African traditions.  Director Kevin Macdonald does what only great directors can; he takes you to another place and time and lets you inhabit it.Watching the film I was reminded of Caligula, whose descent into madness bathed Rome in blood and cruelty.  But Caligula was never charming.  The first half of this movie shows a charismatic Idi Amin, larger than life, riding high on the love of his people.  (This was before he slaughtered 300,000 of his countrymen and fed his ex-wives to crocodiles.)  We are swept up into his force of personality just as our protagonist, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, is swept up in it.  That works, although it must be pointed out that despite a terrific performance by James McAvoy as Garrigan, he is dreadfully miscast.  Despite all that happens to him, he never looks older than 19, which compounds his already maddening innocence.  Next to Amin, Whitaker, he looks 12.Whitaker's performance has been justifiably praised; it's a performance of a lifetime for him.  However, that sleepy eye of his is really getting tiresome, especially when playing a historical figure whose face is well known.  Also, there is a weight to Whitaker's persona that is distracting, one gets the sense that he is so profoundly miserable, nothing could ever make him even slightly happy.  This gloom is highly evident in interviews.  Though he is clearly of the ""method"" school, this ponderous quality does make it difficult for him to disappear into parts, often he wears them.One quick aside regarding Gillian Anderson who plays Sarah, wife of Dr. David Merritt.  Ever noticed that when Brits venture forth into the most God-forsaken remains of the empire to live on beetles and grubs and do good in a general sort of way for no particular reason, they invariably look like ex-runway models?  Ms. Anderson is breathtaking, and the alleged romantic encounter with Dr. Garrigan, still shaving with a rubber razor, is beyond ludicrous.The film concerns two men, Amin and Garrigan, both losing their souls in parallel.  Garrigan is a clueless twit high on a sense of adventure.  Amin is more duplicitous, and as Garrigan grows foul with corruption, Amin grows horrific in his madness.  The most memorable exchange of the movie comes when Garrigan tells Amin that he is a child, and that is why he is so terrifying.  That's quite true.  On the world stage, Amin was always a joke, a sort of revolting, embarrassing joke that made you ashamed to be a human being.  Director Macdonald took on a hard topic with The Last King Of Scotland, and he truly did it justice.  Highly recommended.",5,You Take The Low Road And I'll Take The Low Road,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,2854,"['What', 'notice', 'most', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'recreation', 'Uganda', '1970', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'convincing', 'interior', 'decor', 'music', 'colorful', 'clothing', 'culture', 'clash', 'western', 'influence', 'African', 'traditions', 'Director', 'Kevin', 'Macdonald', 'what', 'only', 'great', 'directors', 'can', 'place', 'time', 'lets', 'inhabit', 'it.Watching', 'film', 'was', 'reminded', 'Caligula', 'descent', 'madness', 'bathed', 'Rome', 'blood', 'cruelty', 'Caligula', 'was', 'never', 'charming', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'charismatic', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'larger', 'life', 'riding', 'high', 'love', 'people', 'was', 'slaughtered', '300,000', 'countrymen', 'fed', 'ex-wives', 'crocodiles', 'are', 'swept', 'up', 'force', 'personality', 'just', 'protagonist', 'Dr.', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'swept', 'up', 'must', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'terrific', 'performance', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Garrigan', 'dreadfully', 'miscast', 'never', 'older', '19', 'already', 'maddening', 'innocence', 'Next', 'Amin', 'Whitaker', '12.Whitaker', 'performance', 'been', 'justifiably', 'praised', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'However', 'sleepy', 'eye', 'really', 'getting', 'tiresome', 'especially', 'when', 'playing', 'historical', 'figure', 'face', 'well', 'known', 'Also', 'weight', 'Whitaker', 'persona', 'distracting', 'one', 'sense', 'so', 'profoundly', 'miserable', 'nothing', 'could', 'ever', 'make', 'even', 'slightly', 'happy', 'gloom', 'highly', 'evident', 'interviews', 'clearly', 'method', 'school', 'ponderous', 'quality', 'make', 'difficult', 'disappear', 'parts', 'often', 'them.One', 'quick', 'aside', 'regarding', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'who', 'Sarah', 'wife', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Merritt', 'Ever', 'noticed', 'when', 'Brits', 'venture', 'forth', 'most', 'God-forsaken', 'remains', 'empire', 'live', 'beetles', 'grubs', 'do', 'good', 'general', 'sort', 'way', 'particular', 'reason', 'invariably', 'look', 'ex-runway', 'models', 'Ms.', 'Anderson', 'breathtaking', 'alleged', 'romantic', 'encounter', 'Dr.', 'Garrigan', 'still', 'shaving', 'rubber', 'razor', 'ludicrous.The', 'film', 'concerns', 'two', 'men', 'Amin', 'Garrigan', 'losing', 'souls', 'parallel', 'Garrigan', 'clueless', 'twit', 'high', 'sense', 'adventure', 'Amin', 'more', 'duplicitous', 'Garrigan', 'foul', 'corruption', 'Amin', 'horrific', 'madness', 'most', 'memorable', 'exchange', 'movie', 'when', 'Garrigan', 'Amin', 'child', 'why', 'so', 'terrifying', 'quite', 'true', 'world', 'stage', 'Amin', 'was', 'always', 'joke', 'sort', 'revolting', 'embarrassing', 'joke', 'made', 'ashamed', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'Director', 'Macdonald', 'took', 'hard', 'topic', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'truly', 'did', 'justice', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

A chilling film about the 70's president of Uganda, the charmer-monster Idi Amin. As a story, it could easily stand for many of the developing world's dictators. James McAvoy was superb as Amin's physician portraying the naive, impressionable youth who gradually undergoes a transformation as he discovers the sinister reality behind his boss's charms. His extremely young looks stretch the credibility of such a boy having actually graduated from medical school, but his outstanding performance makes up for it.Hard to watch at the end, with the brutality of Amin and his henchmen reaching monstrous proportions. But precisely because the movie was not filled with scenes of violence, but rather spread them out in gradual doses over the second half, escalating towards the end, that made them all the more harrowing.

""brnn64""","[7, 10]","The above title was a common joke during the 70s when word of Idi Amin Dada's antics reached America.Overall, this is an interesting story involving Idi Amin Dada, who ruled Uganda with an iron fist in the 70s, and a naive Scottish Med schol graduate (actually the title character) who is first captured by Amin's (questionable) charisma, and gets in too deep over his head.It is important to note for those who take their history from movies that this is historical fiction. Amin was all too real, as are a number of events in the film, but the Scottish medical sttudent is pure fiction. However, the story is in character with ""what would Idi do.""Forrest Whittaker does well as Idi, but one wonders why the producers felt it necessary to but blackface makeup on Forrest when he is not that much lighter in complexion than the real Amin (who is shown in newsreel footage).Also, if you are not fond of blood & guts in movies, I would warn you in advance of this one. The real Amin was really into torture and decapatation, and all of this is graphically shown in the film. As is the case with ""Apocalypto,"" it's historically accurate, but too much for some viewers (myself included).Because of the extreme violence and subject matter, this is not the type of movie most people would want to see more than once, but it is very interesting to watch.

1056723,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000NIVJF4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`The Last King of Scotland' opens almost childishly, kind of amateurish, as if it was going to make light of a very serious subject.  Almost immediately though it shifts gears and begins its gradual decline into darker waters, submersing the audience in the stirring madness that was the reign of Idi Amin.  Told through the eyes of fictitious character Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, `The Last King of Scotland' attempts to give the audience a ringside seat to the tragic events surrounding Amin's rise to power; and for the most part it succeeds very well.One must remember that this is not a true story.  It is a fictitious account of historical events.  You can liken it to `Titanic', for it is a fictional story woven around a foundation of actual events.The film opens with Scottish Doctor Nicholas Garrigan making his way to Uganda to help care for the sick villagers but is soon persuaded by the power behind Idi Amin (who has a soft spot for the Scottish) to leave his original plans and become Amin's personal physician.  This decision proved to be devastating for Garrigan, but that realization would come at a time that was almost too late for him.  As Garrigan becomes more knowledgeable of the truth behind Amin's reign, his initial admiration turns to disgust as he realizes the weight of the situation he now finds himself.  Garrigan finds himself acquainted with those in Amin's circle, including one of his wives named Kay with whom he starts a very dangerous relationship.The film is strengthened by the phenomenal performances by the two male leads, both Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy delivering career best performances.  Whitaker delves into the real man that is Idi Amin, the brutality festering beneath his surface always showing through in his eyes.  (His performance reminds me a bit of Yul Brenner's Oscar winning performance in `The King and I', a portrayal of a man savage by nature who tries to justify his actions with a faade of kindness.  Yes, they are two different people in the end, but he similarities are obvious.)  His performance garnered him award after award (a sweep to be exact) and finally got him recognized among his peers.  His performance is extraordinary, but to be honest he is not as good as McAvoy who fleshes out Garrigan with expert precision, creating a character who is complete and real.  As Whitaker slips Amin into savagery, McAvoy is slowing peeling away Garrigan's sanity to unveil a man scarred by his surroundings and paralyzed by his newfound predicament.I was a little let down by Kerry Washington, not because her performance was lacking (it was quick good) but because the script didn't allow her to become someone truly real to us.  The film was so focused on Garrigan's relationship with Amin that it didn't take a few moments to really flesh out his relationship with Kay, and if it had then her performance would have seemed richer.  That is really the only fault I have with the script also, that it fails to fully invest itself in the entirety of Garrigan's surroundings, targeting his interactions with Amin and allowing the rest of the events around him to become mere side-points.  The film is not particularly long so it could have benefited from a few more minutes added to flesh out the entire plot.But, that is really just a small issue, not anything that should detract anyone from seeing this film.The final moments in `The Last King of Scotland' literally took my breath away (and single-handedly landed Whitaker his Oscar, when if the Academy would look at the less showy performance in the same scene they may have made a different choice).

James McAvoy plays Nicholas Garrigan, a Scottish physician who travels to Uganda for the adventure and wins Amin's affections, becoming his personal doctor. Garrigan enters into a moral crisis as he begins to realize the kind of man Amin is, and begins to fear for his own life as events spiral more and more out of his control.Whitaker seizes the chance to play this larger than life character and runs with it -- I've never seen Whitaker give so convincing and transforming a performance. However, as good as he is, McAvoy impressed me more. His performance as Garrigan is not as showy, but it's much more textured and subtle, and his character has the bigger arc from start to finish. Gillian Anderson also does terrific work in a small role as a fellow doctor, who understands things about Amin and the African culture that Garrigan does not.Unlike other recent thrillers set in African nations (""The Constant Gardener,"" ""Hotel Rwanda""), ""The Last King of Scotland"" is not greatly concerned with the geo-political implications of Amin's reign. The atrocities he committed against Ugandans are given only the barest of mentions, and the film sticks almost exclusively to Garrigan and the danger he himself faces. Some may think the film is irresponsible for this reason -- that the plight of one man pales in comparison to the plight of thousands, and I can see where a criticism like that is justified. But the movie packs a powerful wallop regardless, and complaints like this seem like quibbles when up against such an entertaining movie.",5,Exciting African-Set Thriller,1177804800,"04 29, 2007",2007,1650,"['Forest', 'Whitaker', 'titanic', 'performance', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Ugandan', 'dictator', 'who', 'rose', 'power', '1970s', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'Scottish', 'physician', 'who', 'Uganda', 'adventure', 'Amin', 'affections', 'becoming', 'personal', 'doctor', 'Garrigan', 'moral', 'crisis', 'realize', 'kind', 'man', 'Amin', 'fear', 'own', 'life', 'events', 'spiral', 'more', 'more', 'control.Whitaker', 'chance', 'play', 'larger', 'life', 'character', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Whitaker', 'give', 'so', 'convincing', 'transforming', 'performance', 'However', 'as', 'good', 'McAvoy', 'impressed', 'more', 'performance', 'Garrigan', 'not', 'showy', 'much', 'more', 'textured', 'subtle', 'character', 'bigger', 'arc', 'start', 'finish', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'also', 'terrific', 'work', 'small', 'role', 'fellow', 'doctor', 'who', 'things', 'Amin', 'African', 'culture', 'Garrigan', 'other', 'recent', 'thrillers', 'set', 'African', 'nations', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'not', 'greatly', 'concerned', 'geo-political', 'implications', 'Amin', 'reign', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Ugandans', 'are', 'given', 'only', 'barest', 'mentions', 'film', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Garrigan', 'danger', 'may', 'think', 'film', 'irresponsible', 'reason', 'plight', 'one', 'man', 'comparison', 'plight', 'thousands', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'criticism', 'justified', 'movie', 'powerful', 'wallop', 'regardless', 'complaints', 'seem', 'quibbles', 'when', 'up', 'entertaining', 'movie']",N/A

Unhappy with the idea of joining his father's practice, he instead decides to pick a country at random to go and work in. By chance, the country he picks is Uganda. He arrives whilst the country is rejoicing at the rise to power of the charismatic General Idi Amin Dada. By chance, Garrigan happens to treat the general after he is injured by a bull. Amin, a great fan of the Scottish people, insists on making Garrigan his personal physician. Initially Garrigan enjoys his privileged position and develops a personal friendship with Amin, scorning attempts by British diplomats to recruit him as a spy. However, both internal and international dissatisfaction with Amin's brutal repression of political enemies start to gather steam and Garrigan is caught in the whirlwind as Amin's rule begins to unravel.The Last King of Scotland is not a true story, although the brutal nature of Amin's rule of Uganda is pretty accurate. Garrigan is a fictional creation (although he is very loosely based on a British soldier who was far more directly complicit with Amin's regime), ably played by James McAvoy, who convincingly portrays a young, callow doctor who rapidly finds himself out of his depth. However, most of the praise for the film centers on Forest Whitaker's stunning portrayal of Amin. In fact, 'portrayal' is wholly inadequate as a term. Whitaker pretty much becomes Amin for the duration of the movie and rightly won an Oscar, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe for his performance. He nails the contradictory nature of Amin, a man of tremendous charisma who could also snap into a cold-blooded and ruthless murderer in an instant. Gillian Anderson also impresses, although her role is little more than an extended cameo.The movie overall is mostly impressive, with the optimism and hope of the first half gradually giving way to something much darker and more intense. However, this is accompanied by some problems. The movie takes a turn more for the fantastical towards the ending as Garrigan decides to assassinate Amin, and subsequent events are unconvincing (and extremely gruesome). Also, turning the 1976 Entebbe Airport hostage crisis into a mere backdrop for the finale feels like a bit of a slap in the face to those involved in this very real and dramatic event.Whitaker's performance is unimpeachable and McAvoy manages to hold his own against him very well, but overall the somewhat muddled ending dilutes the earlier power of the movie. Also, Garrigan - and the viewer - are perhaps too isolated from the horrors of Amin's leadership. The addition of perhaps a secondary plot (maybe using the massively under-used Gillian Anderson character) showing the 'sharp end' of Amin's criminal actions may also have helped to put the sheer evil of this regime into better perspective.The Last King of Scotland (***) is an ambitious movie worth seeing for one of the great acting achievements of our time, but it unfortunately comes a bit unstuck towards the end.

In essence, it is a weakly made film, with a paper-thin script, inexpert direction and so-so casting.The biggest flaw is in the creation (and casting) of the character of Nicholas Garrigan, the fictional ""personal doctor"" to Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.  The blithe, raffish, amoral Garrigan character is a wimpy stand in the real-life (and considerably more sinister) Bob Astles, a former British soldier who became an advisor to Amin's predecessor, Milton Obode and later switched his allegiance to Amin.  Astles' role in the genocidal horrors of Amin's rule is unclear (or at least unproven) but it is certain that he wasn't the sort of clueless, airheaded innocent as the Nicholas Garrigan character.  In the film, Garrigan is unlikable and utterly unbelievable -- the actor looks like he's sixteen years old (a constant distraction) and he has very little power or on-screen presence.  He constantly makes stupid, unlikely choices and seems to have no self-awareness or awareness of the violent turmoil around him.So are we supposed to turn to Amin to ground this film and give it some heft?  Well, sorry.  Forest Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin seldom goes beyond the flimsiest caricature... Sure, he has a (reasonably) good East African accent and his use of Swahili is impressive, but the character as written is flat, and Whitaker does very little to either add human depth or a sense of inhuman evil to his portrayal.  I am frankly appalled that he won an Oscar for this performance -- even setting aside Leonard DiCaprio's competing role in the similarly-themed ""Blood Diamond"" or Peter O'Toole's ""Venus,"" this was not Oscar worthy.  It was flat and uninvolving -- the movie revolves around Whitaker's inert Amin, and provides little of interest to make up for the vacuum.Sorry...

But, gradually, paranoia, ruthlessness, capricious abuse of power, and lack of concern over human life would reveal a far darker Amin to both the doctor, and to the world, building to a climax both frightening and brutal.Whitaker is the 'glue' that holds the film together, and his ability to make Amin both repellent and charismatic provides one of the screen's most fascinating portrayals of this decade. He certainly deserved his Oscar!Perhaps the film is a bit simplistic on the issues (England's role in Ugandan politics and Amin's rise to power wavers between self-serving and altruistic), but as a thriller, it is very effective.A remarkable film, not to be missed!",5,Whitaker's Bravura Performance Makes Amin Film a Must!,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,1482,"['Chilling', 'funny', 'ruthless', 'yet', 'childlike', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', ""'take"", 'Ugandan', 'dictator', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'truly', 'career-defining', 'role', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'film', 'worthy', 'accolades', 'received', 'Told', 'experiences', 'young', 'fictional', 'Scot', 'doctor', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'Uganda', 'lark', 'drawn', 'charismatic', 'Amin', 'inner', 'circle', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Macdonald', 'making', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'characters', 'time', 'grow', 'giving', 'film', 'believability', 'recent', 'political', 'thriller', 'remake', 'King', 'Men', 'sadly', 'naivety', 'smug', 'skirt-chasing', 'youth', 'doctor', 'Amin', 'promise', 'wealth', 'idyllic', 'existence', 'dictator', 'combination', 'flattery', 'lofty', 'goals', 'boyish', 'charm', 'irresistible', 'gradually', 'paranoia', 'ruthlessness', 'capricious', 'abuse', 'power', 'lack', 'concern', 'human', 'life', 'would', 'reveal', 'far', 'darker', 'Amin', 'both', 'doctor', 'world', 'building', 'climax', 'frightening', 'brutal.Whitaker', ""'glue"", 'film', 'together', 'ability', 'make', 'Amin', 'repellent', 'charismatic', 'one', 'screen', 'most', 'fascinating', 'portrayals', 'decade', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'issues', 'England', 'role', 'Ugandan', 'politics', 'Amin', 'rise', 'power', 'wavers', 'self-serving', 'altruistic', 'thriller', 'very', 'effective.A', 'remarkable', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

If they've researched and prepared and are ready to give 100% to the production, then you're more than likely going to have a successful movie. Movie-goers saw this with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in his portrayal of CAPOTE which won him the Oscar, the Golden Globe and so many other accolades that it'd take up half of a page to list them all. Not surprising, Forest Whitaker has mirrored Hoffman's success with last year's astounding THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND.When you don't see the actor and only see the character, the person doing the portrayal has bottled solid gold for viewers, and Whitaker certainly did this. His breathtaking performance as the deranged dictator General Idi Amin, former president of Uganda, was perfect. Mannerisms, voice, those strangely vacant eyes, they were all eerily present.Although a fictional representation on real events, The Last King of Scotland holds more fact than fiction. Even though one of its main characters (James McAvoy as Dr. Nicholas Garrigan) never really existed, the film inserts him in order for us to see what it was like being on the inside of this bizarre man's government. The brutality of 300,000 slaughter Ugandans is never seen but only hinted at because Dr. Garrigan and the rest of Amin's advisors are never privy to such information, being held tightly to the General's chest. As Idi Amin's paranoia begins surfacing more and more, Dr. Garrigan realizes how dangerous a position he's in -- that being so close to such an unstable figurehead.The cracks in Amin's persona are brutally and perfectly presented by Whitaker. His mood swings from friend to foe happen in the blink of the proverbial eye, and Whitaker makes it all completely believable. The stress Dr. Garrigan (McAvoy) feels is ratcheted up as he realizes he's not really the President's doctor but the prisoner of a genocidal maniac. This added an excellent level of texture to the film, giving the audience someone to care and worry about.Probably the strangest thing about this entire time in history is that many Ugandans still view Idi Amin as a ""great President/leader.""

I also appreciated how the film created the presence of violence and horror without actually having all the gratuitous visuals that we see all too frequently.Negatives: The one drawback for me was the portrayal of Doctor Garrigan. It's not the performance of James McAvoy I'm refering to but the character itself. Garrigan is a self-indulgent, morally weak individual who simply isn't a sympathetic figure.

1056747,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000NIVJF4,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is a highly entertaining film that gets more intense as the film reaches the end. Forest Whitaker does a wonderful job of playing General Idi Amin Dada, a man who rises to power in Uganda becoming the dictator of the country. He is genuinely frightening. James McAvoy plays the young immature Scottish medical doctor, Nicholas Garrigan, who finds himself in a lot of trouble in this troubled nation.The film and the main character, Dr. Garrigan, are fictional; however they are based on the actual history of Idi Amin Dada's genocidal tyranny and the PLO high jacking in Entebbe. Nicholas comes to Uganda on a lark and works in a mission clinic where he tries to seduce the physician's vulnerable wife with little regard for those around him. He meets the General by accident and impresses Amin. Nicholas Garrigan is at first entranced and entertained by Amin Dada's commanding personality, sarcastic wit, and unique views. However the longer Nicholas remains in the court of Amin Dada, the more complicit he becomes to the evil that is generated and the more mistakes and false steps he takes that begin to distance him from Amin Dada.In some ways the film is about maturity. Clever, witty, intelligent folks from privileged Western backgrounds will sometimes underestimate the level of threat and danger present in situations outside of North American culture. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is one of those folks and his underestimation of the forces of evil bring great harm to those around him and to himself.  Amin confronts him at the end of the film for being an egotistical Westerner who had decided to play with the natives for a lark. Amin shows him that the natives don't play.The Entebbe Airport high jacking by the PLO is relevant to the story and young Nicholas comes very close to losing his life. Will he be a wiser man due to his painful experiences? McAvoy does such a great job of portraying this flippant egotist that even after much pain and death, I doubted that he had changed his ways. This is not a very optimistic vision of human character. In fact it is darkly pessimistic. Idi Amin Dada is a rare occurrence, a homicidal tyrant who thinks nothing of genocide. But Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is not such a rare specimen, for he represents the smart young brass egotist who can do great harm because he lacks the experience and especially the wisdom to avoid danger. When his egotism involves others in exposure to danger he certainly becomes less charming and sympathetic a character.The film is great entertainment, great suspense, and great acting.",5,It takes a lot of pain to make a smart man into a wise man,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,2569,"['highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'more', 'intense', 'film', 'end', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'wonderful', 'job', 'playing', 'General', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Dada', 'man', 'who', 'power', 'Uganda', 'becoming', 'dictator', 'country', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'young', 'immature', 'Scottish', 'medical', 'doctor', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'who', 'lot', 'trouble', 'troubled', 'nation.The', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Garrigan', 'are', 'fictional', 'however', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'history', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Dada', 'genocidal', 'tyranny', 'PLO', 'high', 'jacking', 'Entebbe', 'Nicholas', 'Uganda', 'lark', 'mission', 'clinic', 'where', 'seduce', 'physician', 'vulnerable', 'wife', 'little', 'regard', 'General', 'accident', 'Amin', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'first', 'entranced', 'entertained', 'Amin', 'Dada', 'commanding', 'personality', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'unique', 'views', 'However', 'longer', 'Nicholas', 'court', 'Amin', 'Dada', 'more', 'complicit', 'evil', 'generated', 'more', 'mistakes', 'false', 'steps', 'begin', 'distance', 'Amin', 'Dada.In', 'ways', 'film', 'maturity', 'Clever', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'folks', 'privileged', 'Western', 'backgrounds', 'will', 'sometimes', 'underestimate', 'level', 'threat', 'danger', 'present', 'situations', 'North', 'American', 'culture', 'Dr.', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'one', 'folks', 'underestimation', 'forces', 'evil', 'bring', 'great', 'harm', 'Amin', 'end', 'film', 'being', 'egotistical', 'Westerner', 'who', 'had', 'decided', 'play', 'natives', 'lark', 'Amin', 'natives', 'do', ""n't"", 'play.The', 'Entebbe', 'Airport', 'high', 'jacking', 'PLO', 'relevant', 'story', 'young', 'Nicholas', 'very', 'close', 'losing', 'life', 'Will', 'be', 'wiser', 'man', 'due', 'painful', 'experiences', 'McAvoy', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'flippant', 'egotist', 'even', 'much', 'pain', 'death', 'doubted', 'had', 'changed', 'ways', 'not', 'very', 'optimistic', 'vision', 'human', 'character', 'fact', 'darkly', 'pessimistic', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Dada', 'rare', 'occurrence', 'homicidal', 'tyrant', 'who', 'nothing', 'genocide', 'Dr.', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'not', 'such', 'rare', 'specimen', 'smart', 'young', 'brass', 'egotist', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'great', 'harm', 'experience', 'especially', 'wisdom', 'avoid', 'danger', 'When', 'egotism', 'others', 'exposure', 'danger', 'certainly', 'less', 'charming', 'sympathetic', 'character.The', 'film', 'great', 'entertainment', 'great', 'suspense', 'great', 'acting']",N/A

Forest has a slight asymmetry to his face, where his eyes don't quite match, and while Idi Amin didn't possess this facial quality, Whittaker made good use of it for a ""crazy eyes"" effect. Soon you totally accept him as Idi Amin, you can't see the Forest for the Idi, you might say. He has a great accent, too, speaking with a British accent, reflecting his time in the British Army, since Uganda was a British colony up until 1962. What made the Oscar people take notice, I think, was how he was able to capture the mad dictator's charisma, the sweet and seductive charm, and then gradually reveal the terror of what was happening in Uganda.In interviews with the actor and director Kevin Macdonald included with the DVD they talk about how they didn't want to demonize Idi Amin. It is not exactly Springtime for Hitler, but it does show another side of him. He is ultimately revealed as a monster, but he was also a charismatic leader who did a lot of good for his country and people--when he wasn't killing them.The screenplay was based on a novel by Giles Foden. The story is told through the eyes of a totally fictional character, Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy). He is a strange looking man, and one of the opening scenes shows him screaming, as if having a nightmare, and he looks positively wraith-like. Not sure if this was supposed to be foreshadowing of the horror to come, or if he was just screaming out of boredom. Wanting to get out of his hum drum life and have some adventure. Once he gets to Uganda and becomes Idi Amin's personal physician, he proves an excellent foil for the dictator, and provides an interesting perspective to tell the tale. Whittaker has a way of calling his name, ""Nicholas, Nicholas"" that is sweetly sing songy, but becomes increasingly disturbing as the terror ratchets up.Alex Heffes composed music for the soundtrack, that is mostly good to adequate, but the best part of the soundtrack is the different African songs used. They really convey the excitement, vitality, and promise of an old country struggling to come into the modern world. Toko Momo by Wandel, Nakawunde by Percussion Discussion Africa, Afro Disco Beat by Tony Allen, Save Me E. T. by Mensah & The Tempos Band, Grazing in the Grass by Hugh Masekela, Kasongo by Afrigo Band, Fever by Jingo, Bukom Mashie Mashie by Oscar Sulley & The Uhuru Dance Band, Love Is You by Ofo The Black Company, and Acholi Pot Song by Ndere Dance Troupe really contribute to the excitement of this fine film.

Yet, this time, I believe they got it right.In the DVD special features, the director of THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND said that the script for the movie had been in lingo for a long time because it relied so much on casting. They had to have the right man to play Idi Amin. He had to be charismatic, youthful, large, larger than life and able to tap into a tremendous evil that erupted at appropriate times. Boy, did they find the right man.The movie is based on a novel written by Giles Foden. The novel depicts a fictional account of a Scottish doctor who manages to get in with the powerful leader and become his right hand man. He's blindly drawn into Amin's world, oblivious to the cruelty Amin is amassing all over the country.The only unfortunate thing is that IT IS a fictional account, but amazingly it gives an indepth look into a side of the man that has never been seen. The Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (played by James McAvoy), was created based on a collaboration of hundreds of stories, myths and inside tales that have circled over time.The unmistakable truth about THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND is the death count and the carnage that the man is accountable for. 300,000 Ugandans lost their lives under Amin's ethnic cleansing and struggle to maintain power, including Kay Amin, and many other family members. THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND and Amin's wrath is a testament to what can happen when power and ego corrupt a leader.Forrest Whitaker is amazing and the movie is not to be missed.",5,for once...

1056751,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000NIVJF4,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","I felt oddly bemused while watching ""The Last King of Scotland""; despite Forest Whitaker's brilliant portrayal of Ugandan president Idi Amin, everything else about the film felt incomplete. This is mostly because of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), a fictional character loosely based on Amin's real life British associate, Bob Astles. The movie opens in Garrigan's native Scotland in 1970, where he and his parents are sitting at the dinner table. Garrigan has officially been made a doctor, and his parents are rightfully proud. But after this supposedly happy occasion, Garrigan hastily decides to leave home. A decent explanation for why he was unhappy would have been nice; a couple of ideas are alluded to but never fully developed, most notably the pressure Garrigan feels to please his father.More time should have been spent on developing such a significant character, which I think is the main reason why I'm only giving ""The Last King of Scotland"" three stars. Garrigan came off as a young, naive risk taker, going into something blindly without stopping to consider the potential consequences. Only when he enters Uganda does he realize a military coup is in full swing, and only after he joins an isolated medical team does he realize how scarce doctors are in this country. I had a hard time believing in such a character, especially since he wanted to leave Scotland so badly. Nonetheless, he feels the need to help, which is certainly an admirable thing to do.If only I could believe this character was actually a doctor. Despite many scenes of medical emergencies, and despite the fact that he wears a white lab coat, everything about Garrigan seemed false. Maybe this is because he lacks responsibility; he first meets Dr. Merrit (Adam Kotz) and his wife, Sara (Gillian Anderson), two British physicians volunteering in a remote Ugandan village. Almost immediately, he takes a liking to Sara, and he unsuccessfully tries to make the most of it when her husband is called away. Again, a decent explanation for Garrigan's mindset would have been appreciated. What kind of a doctor could justify being so cavalier with someone else's feelings?His misguided nature leads him to an encounter with newly appointed president Idi Amin, who overthrew former president Milton Obote. Amin's introduction marks a dramatic increase in the film's pacing, helped by the fact that Whitaker is disturbingly convincing as the Ugandan dictator. As is often the case with duplicitous characters, Amin is jovial and persuasive when first introduced. It's enough to lure Garrigan into a false sense of security, especially after he's called on to treat Amin's injured hand. This paves the way for a tense friendship, made stronger by the fact that Amin has taken a liking to the Scots; much like a number of African nations, they have resisted being under British control. This emboldens Amin to ask for Garrigan's tee shirt, which has the word ""Scotland"" written on it (supposedly, will be a gift for Amin's son).This chance encounter leads to an enticing yet suspicious offer: Amin wants Garrigan as his personal physician. The rational behind this is flawed, as one would expect something coming from a power-hungry ruler to be--a strong and healthy president means a strong and healthy nation. Garrigan is initially hesitant to accept, but he changes his mind after attending a number of Amin's lavish parties.For a while, things appear to go smoothly. But as the film progresses, we see a gradual shift in Amin's demeanor, one that veers further and further away from jovial and persuasive. It begins when a number of Obote supporters beginning attacking, which eventually turn Amin into a paranoid mess. After a while, he feels he can no longer trust anyone, not even his health minister, Masanga (Abby Mukiibi). The only exception is Garrigan, who Amin now considers to be his most trusted advisor. This understandably weighs heavily on Garrigan. He came to Uganda to be of service to the sick and injured; now he's been unintentionally involved in the country's political turmoil. He eventually beings second guessing himself, not only in terms of associating with Amin, but in terms of associating with Uganda, as well.Unfortunately, he has yet to understand the seriousness of the situation, even after he learns that Amin has slaughtered hundreds of people (supposedly to wipe out any opposition). His first mistake is telling Amin to ""have a talk with"" Masanga after he's seen speaking with a white man in a bar. Needless to say, Masanga immediately disappears. His second mistake is to have an affair with Amin's third wife, Kay (Kerry Washington), resulting in her pregnancy. After months of living with Amin, and after witnessing his decline into severe paranoia, you'd think Garrigan would have learned be extremely careful. But no: he remains the reckless youth he started out as, a plot device I found very hard to accept as believable.I wish I could say that Forest Whitaker's performance is enough to warrant a recommendation for ""The Last King of Scotland."" Alas, it isn't; far too much about this story is lacking, especially in terms of Garrigan's character development. ""You didn't persuade me!"" Amin screams to Garrigan at one point. That pretty much sums up my feelings: this movie didn't persuade me.",3,He Rules with an Iron Fist,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,5328,"['felt', 'oddly', 'bemused', 'watching', 'Last', 'King',

1056753,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000NIVJF4,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[1, 1]","In the beginning of the historically-based drama The Last King of Scotland, we see amiable recent graduate Nicholas Garrigan (winningly played by James McAvoy) plotting to escape what he imagines will be a stilted and stifling Scottish life in a family physicians practice with his father.  He wants something different, something in direct contrast to the dull life he's dreading.  Well... be careful what you wish for, Nicholas!  He gets that (and so much more!) as he later finds himself in a kill-or-be-killed standoff with one of history's most infamous dictators, Idi Amin (brilliantly played by Forest Whitaker, who strikes an ingeniously dissonant note - an affable insanity - in his award-winning performance).From the first moment we see Nicholas on the bus in Uganda, we realize how thoroughly his wish for a divergent experience has been realized.  There is an establishing shot of his as the only (very) white face in a crowd of locals (later repeated in the crowd at an Amin rally) that visually underlines the fish-out-of-water element in this ""stranger in a strange land"" scenario.And our first visions of the rural Ugandan countryside emphasize a different contrast, accentuating disparate elements of both beauty and brutality - scenes where sharp-horned animals roam the streets among well-armed soldiers, majestic and menacing at the same time.Once Nicholas reaches the village where he is to do his work (heck, even on his journey there), we see still another contrast - this time between his spoken intentions and his internal motivations, as his idealism is often overrun by a more hedonistic streak.Thus, very shortly after he meets the local doctor's wife (played by Gillian Anderson), his ""whatever I can do to help"" platitude is put to the test when he sees the harsh conditions under which he'll be working and decides to have a little ""fun"" instead.  And when he finally acquiesces to Amin's request that he serve as personal physician, we wonder if his decision is directed more by his ""happy to help"" attitude or by his desire to dive headlong into the dashing dictator's intoxicating and seemingly-glamorous world.And while I don't want to give anything away from there, suffice it to say that what follows is a very well acted, well-executed political thriller filled with pathos and passion.But aside from all of the more obvious elements of suspense in this film, the one thing that really held my attention and kept me thinking was the overarching question of Garrigan's motivation in almost every situation.  Clearly, he has a good heart, but his altruism is so often undermined by his id-iotic impulsiveness. It is interesting to see which part of him takes charge from moment to moment, as he battles not only the external threat of Amin but struggles as well with his own internal boundaries and demons.Ultimately, the Last King of Scotland is about a lot of things, but to me this film is mostly about lines and borders - borders drawn between countries, between colors, and the more personal lines drawn by each person: what lines are you reluctant to cross, and what do you do once you choose (or are forced) to cross them?

Directed by Scotsman Kevin Macdonald, ""The Last King of Scotland"" filmed with breathtaking cinematography in Uganda chronicles the rise to power of Amin through the eyes of young doctor Nicholas Garrigan.Garrigan played by James McAvoy, was a naive, idealistic newly graduated physician who set out to Africa with the idea of helping the needy in a rural Ugandan clinic.  As a result of a chance meeting with newly annointed Amin, Garrigan becomes his personal physician and confidante.  Much to the dismay of the Brits who let Amin ascend to power, Garrian kowtows to Amin and gets on the program, being elevated to a high ministerial position.Seduced by the power bestowed upon him by Amin, the young doctor is blinded to the corruption of Amin's regime which has degenerated into one of torture and genocide.  Too late he realizes his mistake but is unable to leave the country being shackled by Amin and he begins to fear for his life.Director Macdonald takes some liberties with history but nonetheless provides a disquieting window into the morass into which Uganda was plunged by the dangerous policies orchestrated by the crazed and paranoid Amin.Simon McBurney playing Nigel Stone, a British foreign officer stationed in Uganda was very good in his role as was Kerry Washington playing Kay Amin.

Once the co-star of the film, James McAvoy as ""Dr.Nicholas Garrigan,"" became Amin's personal doctor this film, like a good book, became really difficult to put down.It was a very interesting story which got better and better as it went along. It's also one you won't forget about in a few days. This one stays with you!In real life, Amin was a brutal man and much more so than he is portrayed in this film. It's a disgrace he was able to live comfortably in exile until 2003. Whitaker's portrayal of the sociopath doesn't touch the surface of the Amin's evilness, but Amin, truth be told, was also a charmer. It's amazing how a little charm can make even a mass murderer look like a nice guy.In addition to the fine acting performances of Whitaker and McAvoy, I thought the camera-work in here was well above-average, too.

Though the movie is actually a fact-based fictional account, it is nonetheless a gripping thriller that graphically communicates the horrific scope of Amin's racism, paranoia and megalomania. The core of the film spotlights the improbable coercion of a young, idealistic Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), into becoming Amin's personal physician.  Though Garrigan is at first charmed, sufficiently impressed by the perks of his position, and mostly oblivious, he is ultimately sickened not only by the mounting evidence of Amin's cunning and savagery, but also by his own complicity. Director Kevin McDonald at once gradually builds the story and moves it along at a brisk pace, so that you are eventually on the edge of your seat. There are unflinchingly graphic (though mostly brief) scenes of torture, murder and mutilation that may leave some viewers queasy--all the better to underscore the inhumanity of one of history's most vicious dictators.  Of course ""The Last King of Scotland"" is most spectacular for its two lead actors.  With his drooping eye and shark-like grin, Whitaker makes you feel the full sledgehammer force of Amin's humor, charm, magnanimity and cruelty!  McAvoy maintains just the right balance between innocence, wordliness, courageousness, mounting horror and revulsion. Even if not wholly factual, this excellent movie should at least inspire viewers to read up on the real events--which were far more terrifying than any fiction could ever be--that took place in Uganda during this most turbulent time.",5,Excellent fact-based Thriller!,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2090,"['most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'indicated', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'astounding', 'performance', 'career', 'Ugandan', 'dictator', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'notoriously', 'brutal', 'dictator', 'who', 'plundered', 'country', 'considerable', 'assets', 'expelled', 'Asians', 'who', 'formed', 'backbone', 'economy', 'laid', 'waste', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'estimates', 'range', 'as', 'high', '500,000', 'mostly', 'Ugandan', 'residents', 'real', 'and/or', 'perceived', 'dissidents', 'political', 'opponents', 'walks', 'life', 'eight-year', 'reign', '1971-1979', 'terror', 'movie', 'actually', 'fact-based', 'fictional', 'account', 'nonetheless', 'gripping', 'thriller', 'graphically', 'horrific', 'scope', 'Amin', 'racism', 'paranoia', 'megalomania', 'core', 'film', 'spotlights', 'improbable', 'coercion', 'young', 'idealistic', 'Scottish', 'doctor', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'becoming', 'Amin', 'personal', 'physician', 'Garrigan', 'first', 'charmed', 'sufficiently', 'impressed', 'perks', 'position', 'mostly', 'oblivious', 'ultimately', 'sickened', 'not', 'only', 'mounting', 'evidence', 'Amin', 'cunning', 'savagery', 'also', 'own', 'complicity', 'Director', 'Kevin', 'McDonald', 'once', 'gradually', 'story', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'are', 'eventually', 'edge', 'seat', 'are', 'unflinchingly', 'graphic', 'mostly', 'brief', 'scenes', 'torture', 'murder', 'mutilation', 'may', 'leave', 'viewers', 'queasy', 'better', 'underscore', 'inhumanity', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'vicious', 'dictators', 'course', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'most', 'spectacular', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'drooping', 'eye', 'shark-like', 'grin', 'Whitaker', 'feel', 'full', 'sledgehammer', 'force', 'Amin', 'humor', 'charm', 'magnanimity', 'cruelty', 'McAvoy', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'innocence', 'wordliness', 'courageousness', 'mounting', 'horror', 'revulsion', 'Even', 'not', 'wholly', 'factual', 'excellent', 'movie', 'should', 'least', 'inspire', 'viewers', 'read', 'up', 'real', 'events', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'terrifying', 'fiction', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'took', 'place', 'Uganda', 'most', 'turbulent', 'time']",N/A

I remember his reign of terror, his regime's genocide, his banishing the Indians and Jews who had made Uganda their home.  Then I would see a clip of him on the nightly news; Amin was smiling, he was gregarious, charming--it just wasn't possible so likeable a man could be capable of such atrocities.  When Idi Amin disappeared into exile, in 1979, he disappeared from my memory.Until I saw THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND.  When I saw Forest Whitaker, the way he carried himself, the way he spoke, the way he could be so calmly maniacal. . .the hairs stood up on my neck.  Before my very eyes, Whitaker became Idi Amin, which is why this film is so believable--even though it's a fictional account of his regime.It's an account about Amin and the relationship he has with his personal physician, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy).  Nicholas wins instant points with ""President"" Amin because the young doctor is Scottish--and the Ugandan leader is an enthusiastic fan of Scotland and its culture.  In the beginning, all is well and good; Nicholas becomes intoxicated with his newfound wealth and power--with his ever-increasing influence with Amin.  But everything is an illusion; Uganda is unstable, Amin has many enemies, and when the enemies rebel, the dictator responds with an iron fist.  And the relationship with his physician becomes strained; Nicholas's naivete suddenly yields to remorse, to fear, to helplessness.  This thriller ends at Entebbe Airport, in one of the most brutal and disturbing cinematic scenes I've ever seen.Whitaker, McAvoy, and the rest of the cast furnish unforgettable roles--especially Whitaker, who won an Oscar.  Kudos to director Kevin MacDonald for making a film that is beautiful yet brutal, a film that has heart-pounding suspense.

1056778,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,B000NIVJF4,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[0, 0]","(SEMI SPOILER ALERT)Forest Whitaker really plays the role as only he could...His Amin can go from jovial to horrifying to jovial in the bat of an eye (literally) - -He is both a grown child... and horrible monster at the same time...his glance, the laugh, everything makes you believe he is AMIN... and watching videos of AMIN on YOU TUBE even qualify him as a bit scarier... and to an extent this carries the film.  (Although the real Amin was no fashion plate, he actually wasn't half as monstrous looking at Whitaker's Amin - - but the mix of the jovial nature and crimes against humanity are dramatically enhanced by Whitaker's make-up and bi-polar portrayal.)Unfortunately, there is a problem... I think pretty boy James McAvoy isn't quite convincing in the role.The script is meant to demonstrate the fact that he's wreckless and impulsive (a character that initially endears Amin), but ultimately gets him into trouble, then (SPOILER ALERT) sort of redeems him... unfortunately, he seems more like a calculating pretty boy doctor who at times is just really stupid and naive than a person who is stupid, rebellious and unstable enough to fall under the spell of Amin (as a father figure) and even screw his own wife, right under the eyes of people who would have surely found out (whether or not he was drunk.)Had the film made him out to be a bit more wild, hippie-iesh and a bit mentally unstable - - or his sense of ""un-reality"" being in african better portrayed, had his recklessness and stupidity been better demonstrated, MAYBE the premise of the film would have worked... but at times hr'd too patient and calculating, almost heroic... others, just dumb, clueless and stupid... bordering occasionally on a-moral - -  regrettably, as  the two extremes never congealed in the script or direction.  - - as a result, I just couldn't buy into the last 40 minutes of the film.  Sean Penn, I can imagine might have pulled it off.... but even then, I wonder if the film needed to go into more details about how this guy gained such great blind faith in the monster...Maybe, for example, if there was a supporting character through the film (say a lover) acting as the voice of his conscious, and him fighting against his own stupid nature, it would have worked, but actually, there is no voice of conscious for him... In fact, the person who helps save him in the end does an incredible role in his part, but the tension between the characters aren't really dramatized, so in the big scene we feel little emotion for the plight of the true hero and in fact as he's portrayed, I couldn""t imagine that character risking his life to save him so he could go save Uganda.That said, the sights and sounds (lot's of '70s afro beat) are great... and in general most of the other acting and directing is good...  especially when Whitaker is in the scene and other characters are reacting to him...and many of the scenes are brilliantly directed... and most of the supporting characters in the film are brilliant in the way they play off of Whitaker's AMIN, unfortunately (and this puts me in the minority) for me this slight flaw (as well as occasionally lack of character development) made it not work for me...P.S.

1056779,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000NIVJF4,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Forest Whitaker's ferociously charismatic turn as Idi Amin so dominates this intense historical fiction that it is honestly difficult to pay attention to anything else in this 2006 political thriller. Even though he is definitively the emotional locus, he is intriguingly not the protagonist of the story. That role belongs to young James McAvoy, who plays Nicholas Garrigan, a precocious Scottish doctor who ventures to Uganda to satisfy his need for adventure after graduating medical school. By happenstance, Garrigan is called upon to help Amin with a minor sprain after his private car plows into a cow. Impressed by the young man's lack of hesitancy to take action, Amin appoints Garrigan to be his personal physician, a post that seduces the impressed doctor into the Ugandan dictator's political inner circle and extravagant lifestyle.Scottish director Kevin MacDonald brings his extensive documentary filmmaking skills to the fore here, as he creates a most realistic-feeling atmosphere in capturing the oppressive Uganda of the 1970's. Helping considerably with this image are the vibrant color contrasts in Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography and the propulsive action induced by Justine Wright's sharp editing. Screenwriters Peter Morgan (who also wrote ""The Queen"") and Jeremy Brock have developed a sharply delineated character study of Amin, who evolves from a magnetic leader giving hope to his people to a scarifying tyrant conducting murders on an imaginable scale (at least until the genocides in Rwanda and Darfur). It is impossible to over-praise Whitaker's towering performance here. He conveys the dictator's playfulness as well as his unmitigated rage moving from simmering to full boil with a power that is at once bravura and subtle. His relationship with the fictionalized Garrigan turns out to be the plot's essential pivot point, although the contrast between the two can be almost too extreme at times.While McAvoy admirably captures the boyish naivet&eacute; of Garrigan, the character is drawn out in rather broad strokes that make his irresponsibility and self-delusion all the more contrived as the story progresses. To intensify the political upheaval portrayed, the plot takes a melodramatic turn into an adulterous affair and even folds in the infamous 1976 Entebbe hijacking incident to illustrate Garrigan's increasingly precarious situation. It's all exciting and even downright brutalizing toward the end, but it also starts to feel a bit too Hollywood in execution. Kerry Washington shows genuine versatility as Amin's cloistered third wife Kay, while Simon McBurney oozes cynical suspicion with ease as a British operative. A convincingly Brit-accented Gillian Anderson makes her few scenes count as a weary clinic physician who proves to have better instincts than Garrigan.

Trimnell ""edwardtrimnell.com""","[0, 0]","In The Last King of Scotland, Forest Whitaker accomplishes an extremely difficult task: portraying a famous contemporary character who has made numerous appearances in the media. But Whitaker makes the role of Idi Amin look easy. I remember seeing Idi Amin on the news during the 1970s, and Forest Whitaker effectively becomes the African dictator in this movie.The script touches upon the violence of the Idi Amin regime; but the film is mostly a character study. By all accounts, Amin was a charismatic character as well as a frightening one. The Amin of The Last King of Scotland is terrifying, but at the same time, somewhat likeable. In this regard, he is a most credible villain.The only flaw in this film was the believability factor regarding the relationship between Amin and the young Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (played by James McAvoy). Within days of his arrival in Uganda, Garrigan meets Amin in a situation that can only be described as an unlikely coincidence. His subsequent rise from youthful volunteer physician to close confidant of Amin seems a bit contrived. Similarly, Garrigan's downfall comes about when he becomes romantically involved with one of Amin's wives, an unlikely scenario given the risks for both parties.Nevertheless, since so few Western viewers are familiar with Uganda, the movie was enhanced by a Western point-of-view. Moreover, a few Westerners did in fact have access to Idi Amin. Garrigan's character is loosely based on a real British citizen, Bob Astles, who became an associate of Amin during the 1970s. Astles, however, was in his late forties when Amin came to power, and he had already spent a number of years in Uganda. If Garrigan's character had been a bit older, and a bit more of an insider in Uganda, his situation would have been more credible.Despite these flaws, The Last King of Scotland is a captivating ride.

There is a ""Scottish"" connection for the film that goes beyond Amin's documented passion for all things Scottish. He named two of his sons MacKenzie and Campbell.The director, Kevin MacDonald is Scottish. He has directed a dozen films since 1995, and mostly is known as a superb documentarian. He made HOWARD HAWKS: American Artist (1997). He won an Oscar for ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER (1999), about the 1972 terrorist attack at the Munich Olympics. A few years ago he made TOUCHING THE VOID (2003), based on a true story about a mountain climbing accident in the Andes in 1985. Oddly when one ""Goggles"" this director there is only a slim bounty. Most of the numerous hits belong to another Kevin MacDonald, an imminent Professor of Psychology in California. Young MacDonald directs KING with an almost documentary eye on history and real events. It is also fascinating, of course, to mix in a major character that is fictional.This film is based on a debut novel by Giles Foden, available with a hefty 352 page read awaiting. It was reviewed as ""dark but turbulent reading"". Foden inserted a fictional character right in the middle of Amin's reign -a young Scottish doctor named Nicholas Garrigan, who after newly graduating from medical school, probably out of boredom, spins a globe, closes his eyes, and stops the spin with his finger squarely on Uganda.James McAvoy plays Dr. Garrigan in the film. He, too, is Scottish, born in the late 70's just as Amin was forced into exile. A handsome slight-stature actor, one is surprised to discover that in real life McAvoy is a highly skilled boxer, accomplished fencer, gymnast, acrobat, rugby player, guitarist, and actual ""fire eater"". As Garrigan, however there are no heroics or grand physical feats on display. He plays a wide-eyed randy innocent charging into Africa like a tourist on a trek to London -leading the way with his crotch, his charm, and his flashing blue eyes. McAvoy has been around in films for more than a decade, fleshing out the ranks in BAND OF BROTHERS (2001), being agile and mysterious in THE CHILDREN OF DUNE (2003), and most of us remember him last year as the wonderful Tumnus, the Faun in THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (2005).Gillian Anderson manages a tolerable English accent, and makes a good impression in her brief scenes as the wife of a fellow doctor. She looks good as a blond, and in no time at all heated up the screen with a smoldering sexuality. Kerry Washington was effective as Amin's third wife, Kay, who Garrigan has an affair with that ends tragically. Simon McBurney had a good turn as Nigel Stone, a twit Brit politico -oddly looking a lot like Roman Polanski in the role. Author Giles Foden did a cameo as a British journalist.The cinematographer was Anthony Dod Mantle, and Englishman who has worked a lot with director Lars Von Trier in Europe. His camera work in KING was lush, and dripping in Ugandan heat and rich red earthen tones -even the medals and epaulets on Amin's fancy uniforms all seemed to jump off the screen in their primary spectrum richness. They shot the film in Uganda, and that gave it a strong sense of ""place"" within the fabric of the tale.The film absolutely belongs to Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin Dada. He delivered dialogue confidently in everything from a sotto voche stage whisper to a thunderous bellicose clap at the top of his voice, like a singer who has a several octave range. This is an actor at the apex of his game. He gave us an Amin that could genuinely charm, or seduce with a smile, a story, or a parable -only to explode in your face a moment later -taking the impact of a Joe Pesci performance in GOOD FELLAS (1990), and stretching it, testing it, pumping it with adrenaline. From his first entrance where he strode into the camera's eye -he used up every inch of the lens field, filling every frame with abounding energy, using up all the air in the room, let us dazzled and nearly faint. It was not just his immensity, his 6'2"" bulk -big men can be unimpressive, even invisible. He takes the concept of ""dynamic"" and super-charges it with a fully mature completely-realized organic smooth smirking and lethal character; unpredictable, extremely dangerous, unstable and fascinating.Forest Whitaker has been good, very good in films for over 20 years. Who can forget his performance in THE CRYING GAME (1992), or how he broke your heart in Clint Eastwood's BIRD (1988), made you smile and weep in PHENOMENON (1996), or intrigued you as the Black American samurai in Jim Jarmusch's GHOST DOG (1999). Whitaker will now live strong in our minds as Idi Amin, pushing aside even the powerhouse portrayal of Amin by Yaphet Kotto in RAID ON ENTEBBE (1977), or Julius Harris as Amin in VICTORY AT ENTEBBE (1976). As a curiosity, one might take a look at Amin, playing himself before his exile in IDI AMIN DADA: A Self-Portrait (1974).I would rate THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND (2006) at 4 stars; mostly for its acting

We had Crash the film for middle class hand wringers everywhere now we have this.Based losely on historical fact bored middle class Scot decides to travel to Uganda after picking it out by spinning his globe (it came second after Canada) Jumps on a bus, strikes up a conversation with young African woman who gets off the bus and wakes him up with the words ""This is my stop""  Which apparently means ""Jump into bed with me, I just met you""That scene realy sums up the film.  Bored middle class white male goes to dark skinned country for a bit of fun and adventure, sleeping around with a few natives who after all, judging by this film are falling all over him.The nonsense just does not stop.  We then have our brave Scot abroad attacking the 'evil 'English' colonialsist pointing out he is ""Scotish not English""  (Strange that most people refer to themselves as Brits abroad not English but then it wouldnt make the film half as daft) Now lets get one thing straight.  Post braveheart we have Scots trying to fob off the world that they are some kind of opressed minority what rubbish.  Scots have been the most active participants in some of the most horrific bloody episodes of British colonial history and the slave trade,  just look how many West Indians have the surname Campbell.  Now I wonder how they got a Scotish surname????This film covers nothing of any relevance to Idi Amins life.  Idi Amin, Uganda, Africans they are all the background to just another boring 'poor westerner goes abroad and gets a little in over his head'  We have seen it a million times before.Where is the background of Amin?  His life, his hardships why he took the name Idi Amin in the first place?  Remember this was a period of Pan Africanism but this is non-existant in this film as our great white hope has a great time getting drunk, hanging out with the mad ruler of an African nation, sleeping with a few natives (including the wife of Amin) and then getting out (needless to say at the expense of yet another African life (but dont worry, like all Africans in this film you dont get to know him long enough to care, you only find out in the last second of his life he has a family))Where is Amins pan Islamism? (the only 'mention' of it is reference to Palestinians as his 'brothers')Where are the reasons behind his expulsion of Asians from Uganda?  Nothing, just a few lines on a news reel refering to them as 'leeches'  (needless to say it just adds to the 'crazy African leader' image the film works so well)  Nothing is told of how the Ugandan capital was almost a no go area to Africans, how much of the ecomony was controled by Asians, nothing is examined of the resentment felt by Africans towards Asians in Uganda, nothing is examined of the open racism of Asians towards Africans not only in Uganda but at that time in many parts of Africa where Asians were seen as the 'middle men' between the colonial power and the African majority.I have heard over the years numerous reasons behind it from Asians refusing to take Ugandan nationality and intergrate into Ugandan society to Amin being turned down by an Asian lady.  None of this is looked at though, one of the most important periods of Ugandan history is covered in approx 5 minutes of a 2 hour film.And what about the atrocities commited by Amin?  Nope, our poor Scot abroad is shown a few horrible pictures (by another Brit of course) not much on how Ugandans felt though.So where does this leave us?  Just another pointless travel film at the end of the day, so what it is set in Uganda during Amins time you may as well watch the Beach it has a backdrop of drug smuggling.Bored middle class white male goes abroad seeking bit of adventure, has good time at first but then gets a little tired of the horrible natives killing each other so tries to leave before getting caught up in it, thankfully does so it all ends well.Just about sums up this film.",1,Awful just plain awful where is the 0 star option?,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,3969,"['More', 'up', 'white', 'mans', 'burdon', 'rubbish', 'here', 'had', 'Crash', 'film', 'middle', 'class', 'hand', 'wringers', 'everywhere', 'now', 'have', 'this.Based', 'losely', 'historical', 'fact', 'bored', 'middle', 'class', 'Scot', 'travel', 'Uganda', 'picking', 'out', 'spinning', 'globe', 'came', 'second', 'Canada', 'Jumps', 'bus', 'up', 'conversation', 'young', 'African', 'woman', 'who', 'bus', 'wakes', 'up', 'words', 'stop', 'Which', 'apparently', 'Jump', 'bed', 'just', 'met', 'scene', 'realy', 'up', 'film', 'Bored', 'middle', 'class', 'white', 'male', 'dark', 'skinned', 'country', 'bit', 'fun', 'adventure', 'sleeping', 'around', 'few', 'natives', 'who', 'judging', 'film', 'are', 'falling', 'him.The', 'nonsense', 'just', 'not', 'stop', 'then', 'have', 'brave', 'Scot', 'abroad', 'attacking', ""'evil"", 'colonialsist', 'pointing', 'Scotish', 'not', 'English', 'Strange', 'most', 'people', 'refer', 'Brits', 'abroad', 'not', 'English', 'then', 'make', 'film', 'half', 'daft', 'Now', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'Post', 'have', 'Scots', 'trying', 'fob', 'off', 'world', 'are', 'kind', 'opressed', 'minority', 'what', 'rubbish', 'Scots', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'active', 'participants', 'most', 'horrific', 'bloody', 'episodes', 'British', 'colonial', 'history', 'slave', 'trade', 'just', 'look', 'how', 'many', 'West', 'Indians', 'have', 'surname', 'Campbell', 'Now', 'wonder', 'how', 'got', 'Scotish', 'surname', 'film', 'nothing', 'relevance', 'Idi', 'Amins', 'life', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Uganda', 'Africans', 'are', 'background', 'just', 'boring', ""'poor"", 'westerner', 'abroad', 'little', 'head', 'have', 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'before.Where', 'background', 'Amin', 'life', 'hardships', 'why', 'took', 'name', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'first', 'place', 'Remember', 'was', 'period', 'Pan', 'Africanism', 'non-existant', 'film', 'great', 'white', 'hope', 'great', 'time', 'getting', 'drunk', 'hanging', 'out', 'mad', 'ruler', 'African', 'nation', 'sleeping', 'few', 'natives', 'including', 'wife', 'Amin', 'then', 'getting', 'out', 'needless', 'say', 'expense', 'yet', 'African', 'life', 'dont', 'worry', 'Africans', 'film', 'dont', 'get', 'know', 'long', 'enough', 'care', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'last', 'second', 'life', 'family', 'Where', 'Amins', 'pan', 'Islamism', 'only', ""'mention"", 'reference', 'Palestinians', ""'brothers"", 'Where', 'are', 'reasons', 'expulsion', 'Asians', 'Uganda', 'Nothing', 'just', 'few', 'lines', 'news', 'reel', 'refering', ""'leeches"", 'needless', 'say', 'just', ""'crazy"", 'African', 'leader', 'image', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'Nothing', 'told', 'how', 'Ugandan', 'capital', 'was', 'almost', 'go', 'area', 'Africans', 'how', 'much', 'ecomony', 'was', 'controled', 'Asians', 'nothing', 'examined', 'resentment', 'felt', 'Africans', 'towards', 'Asians', 'Uganda', 'nothing', 'examined', 'open', 'racism', 'Asians', 'towards', 'Africans', 'not', 'only', 'Uganda', 'time', 'many', 'parts', 'Africa', 'where', 'Asians', 'were', 'seen', ""'middle"", 'men', 'colonial', 'power', 'African', 'majority.I', 'have', 'heard', 'years', 'numerous', 'reasons', 'Asians', 'refusing', 'take', 'Ugandan', 'nationality', 'intergrate', 'Ugandan', 'society', 'Amin', 'being', 'turned', 'down', 'Asian', 'lady', 'None', 'looked', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'periods', 'Ugandan', 'history', 'covered', 'approx', '5', 'minutes', '2', 'hour', 'film.And', 'what', 'atrocities', 'commited', 'Amin', 'Nope', 'poor', 'Scot', 'abroad', 'shown', 'few', 'horrible', 'pictures', 'Brit', 'course', 'not', 'much', 'how', 'Ugandans', 'felt', 'though.So', 'where', 'leave', 'Just', 'pointless', 'travel', 'film', 'end', 'day', 'what', 'set', 'Uganda', 'Amins', 'time', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'Beach', 'backdrop', 'drug', 'smuggling.Bored', 'middle', 'class', 'white', 'male', 'abroad', 'seeking', 'bit', 'adventure', 'good', 'time', 'first', 'then', 'little', 'tired', 'horrible', 'natives', 'killing', 'other', 'so', 'leave', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'thankfully', 'well.Just', 'sums', 'film']",N/A
1056789,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000NIVJF4,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND delves into the history of Ugandan leadership in the 1970s with gusto.  One of the characters (Sarah, the doctor's wife) wisely observes that the crowds that fill the streets cheering as Idi Amin takes control from Milton Obote had the same reaction for the previous dictator and will have the same for the one who follows Amin.  It is that aspect of this very fine film that hits home: the people desperately want to be ruled by a hero who will care for them and they maintain hope that each successive 'hero' will be better.Director Kevin Macdonald bases his 'biography' on the fictionalized novel of the same name by Giles Foden, transformed into a fine screenplay by Jeremy Brock.  In order for us to understand the full nature of Idi Amin the story is told through the eyes of a fresh young Scottish physician Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who leaves his home looking of adventure and settles in Uganda as a mission doctor with Dr. David Merrit (Adam Kotz) and his beautiful wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson).  Garrigan learns his role quickly, is attracted to Sarah, but Sarah is wise and turns Garrigan's attention to the rising problem of the overthrow of the Ugandan government by the enigmatic Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker).  An incident occurs that draws Garrigan into Amin's favor and much against the advice of Sarah, Garrigan falls under the spell of Amin, becoming his official physician.  The two men form a warm bond of friendship and trust and it is through this bond that we see the human aspect of Idi Amin, a man born poor but who has risen to power due much to the connection with the British he loathes.Gradually Garrigan sees the inner workings of Amin's mind, his madness and his ever-increasing brutality as he faces a world as the dictator who will control everything.  Garrigan has an unfortunate affair with one of Amin's wives Kay (the very beautiful and gifted Kerry Washington) and as the country is falling under the slaughtering of Amin, Garrigan finally sees his implication in the rule and undergoes the turnabout effects of Amin's brutal strategy.  The film ends very quietly with and reenactment of the incident at Entebbe that brought the world's attention to the heinous dictator of Uganda.Forest Whitaker is brilliant as Amin: he has obviously studied the man from newsreels and has been able to go beyond press reports to find the humble man who rose to power.  McAvoy embodies the fictional physician and has far more screen time and a more sophisticated role than Whitaker and deserves more praise for this performance than he has received.  The entire cast is excellent. For once a film about the violence that erupts too often in Africa pays more attention to characters and the gorgeous landscape of Africa than to fighting and killing: the evidence of Amin's mass murders is shown in photographs and the monstrosity his deeds is carefully focused on one particularly heinous death.  The musical score by  Alex Heffes uses native songs and rarely calls attention to itself - the mark of a brilliant composer.  In the end THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND serves up a hefty slice of history altered by fiction to enhance the storyline but presents a case for how Amin came to power and the indomitable spirit of the people of Uganda despite the government.  A fine film on many levels.

After watching it, it's easy to see why.  Years ago I saw another film based on the same character called ""The Rise and Fall of Idi Amin"".  In that film, it was hard to take Idi Amin seriously because basically all he did was walk around the place saying stupid things and acting crazy.  In this film however, the character (Idi Amin) is portrayed as a charming, funny, unassuming and simple man who one wouldn't mind being in his company.  Later however, we see the character evolve or we see him for what he really is, which is a despotic monster.Idi Amin's character was difficult because he was very dichotomous.  Forest Whitaker must have studied the character throughly because he seemed so natural.  There are two scenes in the film involving Idi Amin which made me as well as the audience laugh so hard, yet close to the end it can make some of the hardest people cry.Forest Whitaker should get an academy award for his role in this film or at least nominated.

I'm not sure how historically accurate it is to Ugandan History but it is a movie.My biggest issue with the movie was one scene that almost literally made me sick.

He becomes the cruel dictator for every moment he is on the screen in this two-hour film and plays Amin as an extremely complex man who has had an interesting experience in the British military, loves all things Scottish and is willing to put his complete trust in a young white physician Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who goes to Uganda in the early 1970's to begin his practice of medicine. Young and full of optimism, he goes to Uganda to ""make a difference,"" becomes Amin's personal physician quite by accident on his part and gradually becomes sucked into the maelstrom of the dictator's evil machinations.The music is beautiful--  for example, a native singer performs a soulful rendition of Kris Kristofferson's plaintive ""Me and Bobby McGhee""-- and the filming comes off as completely authentic. My only concern with this must-see movie is that McAvoy looks too young to be a physician. Surely he would have had to have been approaching thirty to have just finished medical school, but he looks much younger. I heard an African American professor giving a civil rights speech shortly after Whitaker won his awards who in passing criticized this film because Amin is ""saved and protected"" by a white man, the physician. (Garrigan is a fictionalized character from the novel by Giles Foden.) I would argue just the opposite since Garrigan's life is saved by an African physican who loses his own for saving Garrigan's.The DVD version has documentary footage from Amin's life that is certainly worth seeing along with this highly suspenseful movie that is not to be missed.",5,A Much Deserved  Oscar and Golden Globe Winner,1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,1698,"['Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'praise', 'awards', 'received', 'stunningly', 'rich', 'performance', 'cruel', 'dictator', 'moment', 'screen', 'two-hour', 'film', 'Amin', 'extremely', 'complex', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'interesting', 'experience', 'British', 'military', 'things', 'Scottish', 'willing', 'put', 'complete', 'trust', 'young', 'white', 'physician', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'Uganda', 'early', '1970', 'begin', 'practice', 'medicine', 'Young', 'full', 'optimism', 'Uganda', 'make', 'difference', 'Amin', 'personal', 'physician', 'quite', 'accident', 'part', 'gradually', 'sucked', 'maelstrom', 'dictator', 'evil', 'machinations.The', 'music', 'beautiful', 'example', 'native', 'singer', 'soulful', 'rendition', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'plaintive', 'Me', 'Bobby', 'McGhee', 'filming', 'off', 'completely', 'authentic', 'only', 'concern', 'must-see', 'movie', 'McAvoy', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'physician', 'Surely', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'approaching', 'thirty', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'medical', 'school', 'much', 'younger', 'heard', 'African', 'American', 'professor', 'giving', 'civil', 'rights', 'speech', 'shortly', 'Whitaker', 'won', 'awards', 'who', 'passing', 'criticized', 'film', 'Amin', 'saved', 'protected', 'white', 'man', 'physician', 'Garrigan', 'fictionalized', 'character', 'novel', 'Giles', 'Foden', 'would', 'argue', 'just', 'opposite', 'Garrigan', 'life', 'saved', 'African', 'physican', 'who', 'own', 'saving', ""Garrigan's.The"", 'DVD', 'version', 'documentary', 'footage', 'Amin', 'life', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'along', 'highly', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

Then they will always manage to get rid of this tyrant after, in this case, six hundred thousand dead. It is always easy for the west to sacrifice a few hundred thousand people in some supposedly backward and underdeveloped country. But the film is disgusting because a young and small Scottish doctor who is running away from his oppressive father gets baited by the monstrous grotesque and disgusting tyrant in some kind of perverse father transfer.

James MacAvoy was tremendous as the nave Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, a young med school grad who traded a safe career as a country doctor in his dad's practice for a life of adventure in a mission hospital in Uganda. Garrigan is a skilled doctor, but also incredibly callow. Arriving in Uganda at the time of Idi Amin's takeover in 1971, he intends to boff everything in sight, including the wife of his fellow doctor. Coming on the future dictator whose car has collided. Garrigan inadvertently finds favor with the strongman and soon finds himself the his personal physician. Amin then begins to give the doctor more and more responsibilities, until he is so enmeshed he cannot escape.(Note: some spoilers follow)First off, Garrigan is fictional, which gives the filmmakers a couple of options. They can either make him the eyes of the audience, a  means for letting them see events in a naturalistic fashion. Or they can use him allegorically, making him stand for something larger than himself. In the case of ""Last King,"" the filmmakers seemingly tried to use him as both, but without success. Large swaths of Ugandan history are kept from Garrigan's eyes, and therefore our own. Amin is portrayed as large and lovable, with only a hint of the beast within. When it comes time for Garrigan to realize what a murderous monster Amin really is, Garrigan is brought up to speed in just a few minutes. It's at this point that the movie became unbelievable. We are asked to believe that everyone but Garrigan knew what was going on in the country. But the good Doctor was hardly kept in isolation, so his continued ignorance (when surrounded by those who knew the truth and were trying to tell it to him) is incredible. Garrigan doesn't even function as an allegorical figure, represting the outside world, since Amin's brutality was well known outside his own country.I demur from those who admire Forest Whitaker's depiction of the dictator. FW is too much of a teddy bear to function as homicidal maniac. His sudden turn from genial, oafish strongman to brooding maniac comes too swiftly to be believable. Watch the shots of the real Amin at the end of the film and in the additional material. He was a scary guy, with cold, piercing eyes. Sorry, Forest, but I would not have voted you the Oscar.""Last King of Scotland"" is a perplexing film that could have been much more. The final scenes, depicting the Entebbe raid in 1979, exist less for what they say about Amin or Uganda than as a convenient means for letting Garrigan escape the country. Why else the brutal scene in the room adjacent to where the hostages were kept? The film's first half promised a real classic about Africa and the forces that created a man like Amin. The failure of the film's second half, with its bloody scenes of torture, indicated a failure of nerve to follow through on that promise.",2,What's wrong with this picture?,1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,2903,"['What', 'wonderful', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'James', 'MacAvoy', 'was', 'tremendous', 'nave', 'Dr.', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'young', 'med', 'school', 'grad', 'who', 'traded', 'safe', 'career', 'country', 'doctor', 'dad', 'practice', 'life', 'adventure', 'mission', 'hospital', 'Uganda', 'Garrigan', 'skilled', 'doctor', 'also', 'incredibly', 'callow', 'Arriving', 'Uganda', 'time', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'takeover', '1971', 'boff', 'everything', 'sight', 'including', 'wife', 'fellow', 'doctor', 'Coming', 'future', 'dictator', 'car', 'collided', 'Garrigan', 'inadvertently', 'favor', 'strongman', 'soon', 'personal', 'physician', 'Amin', 'then', 'give', 'doctor', 'more', 'more', 'responsibilities', 'so', 'enmeshed', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'Note', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'First', 'off', 'Garrigan', 'fictional', 'filmmakers', 'couple', 'options', 'can', 'either', 'make', 'eyes', 'audience', 'means', 'letting', 'see', 'events', 'naturalistic', 'fashion', 'can', 'use', 'allegorically', 'making', 'stand', 'something', 'larger', 'case', 'Last', 'King', 'filmmakers', 'seemingly', 'tried', 'use', 'success', 'Large', 'swaths', 'Ugandan', 'history', 'are', 'kept', 'Garrigan', 'eyes', 'therefore', 'own', 'Amin', 'portrayed', 'large', 'lovable', 'only', 'hint', 'beast', 'When', 'time', 'Garrigan', 'realize', 'what', 'murderous', 'monster', 'Amin', 'really', 'Garrigan', 'brought', 'up', 'speed', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'point', 'movie', 'became', 'unbelievable', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'everyone', 'Garrigan', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'country', 'good', 'Doctor', 'was', 'hardly', 'kept', 'isolation', 'continued', 'ignorance', 'when', 'surrounded', 'who', 'knew', 'truth', 'were', 'trying', 'tell', 'incredible', 'Garrigan', ""n't"", 'even', 'function', 'allegorical', 'figure', 'represting', 'outside', 'world', 'Amin', 'brutality', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'own', 'country.I', 'demur', 'who', 'admire', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'depiction', 'dictator', 'FW', 'too', 'much', 'teddy', 'bear', 'function', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'sudden', 'turn', 'genial', 'oafish', 'strongman', 'brooding', 'maniac', 'too', 'swiftly', 'be', 'believable', 'Watch', 'shots', 'real', 'Amin', 'end', 'film', 'additional', 'material', 'was', 'scary', 'guy', 'cold', 'piercing', 'eyes', 'Sorry', 'Forest', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'voted', 'Oscar', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'perplexing', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'final', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'Entebbe', 'raid', '1979', 'exist', 'less', 'what', 'say', 'Amin', 'Uganda', 'convenient', 'letting', 'Garrigan', 'country', 'Why', 'else', 'brutal', 'scene', 'room', 'adjacent', 'where', 'hostages', 'were', 'kept', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'promised', 'real', 'classic', 'Africa', 'forces', 'created', 'man', 'Amin', 'failure', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'torture', 'indicated', 'failure', 'nerve', 'follow', 'promise']",N/A

When you first meet Amin he is fun, approachable and it was easy to find inspiration in his words and personality. Throughout the movie his personality changes from inspiring to paranoid and terrifying. Whitaker's performance flows naturally in and out of these two men trapped in one body. He never misplaces his anger in a sweet scene; his glints of admiration never seep out during a frenzied rant. Whitaker avoids all hints of schizophrenia and ignores all opportunities to dive into multiple personality disorder. Garrigan is unaware of what's happening in Uganda at first, but even after he realizes what Amin is doing, he does nothing to stop him. During the movie, I had to restrain myself from yelling at Garrigan to stop what he's doing, to leave right away or to just do what had to be done. McAvoy's seamlessly grows his character from an acorn to a diseased oak.The supporting cast isn't outshined by the main characters. Kerry Washington plays Kay Amin, Idi Amin's third wife. Her performance is tender, perplexing and sexy. Gillian Anderson plays Sarah Merrit, Garrigan's first love interest in the story. Her sage words and cool demeanor will be left ringing in your ears by the end of the movie. Simon McBurney, Nigel Stone's character, is monstrous in the covert, James Bond sort of way. His maniacal character is not over acted, absolutely to the credit to Stone.Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan use an historic figure to tell a cautionary tale about what happens when you let fear decide who runs your country and what happens when your blind ambition overrules your moral center. Their characters are complete and lacking no texture. The temptation to make characters who are strictly monsters or heroes is avoided. Each character, even Amin, is not strictly good, nor bad, but products of their circumstances. I found the recipe for creating a monster far too realistic to be comfortable and for that I thank the writers for giving me the opportunity to feel that level of discomfort. Even the hero of this movie is only slightly heroic; leaving the melodramatic phony heroics for a superhero movie. Garrigan's transformation left me wondering if I could be any stronger than he is, given the situation he got himself into. I was impressed that the cinematographers and directors made a point of changing the camera style, lighting and framing to fit the mood of the movie. There are scenes where the sweat on someone's face seems radiant in the dark. There is an impressive use of light to set mood that doesn't fall into the clich&eacute; parenthesis.This shattered my personal peace. It has left me to question my own behavior. Have I paid enough attention to my own life? Have I let raw, unadulterated ambition kill parts of my humanity? What would I do in that situation? At what point would I run screaming from Uganda? Can we afford to be afraid and let that fear color our decisions when it comes to our government? How can I tell if someone is a monster when they are so charismatic? Has my ambition hurt other people?"" The Last King of Scotland"" is a heart pounding drama that left me uneasy, utterly disappointed with the quality of the characters' behavior and inspired by the quality of the film making.

1056807,A1UQNX8S78JU0G,B000NIVJF4,Jessica Teel,"[2, 2]","The Last King of Scotland is intelligent, engaging, thrilling, suspenseful, well acted and interesting.  Forrest Whitaker's Oscar is well deserved.  He does a magnificent job portraying Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.  Whitaker powerfully embodies Amin - a man who is as seductively charming as he is viscous for power.  What I wasn't aware of until I saw the film was what a great supporting cast of actors are in the film.  Gillian Anderson (with no hint of Scully to be found) realistically portrays the neglected wife of a relief worker and Kerry Washington shines as the understatedly beautiful wife of Amin.  But most surprising was James McAvoy who portrays the films actual main character Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.  From the DVD's publicity, one doesn't realize that the story is told through Garrigan's eyes, and Amin could be classified more as a supporting role.  McAvoy does a wonderfully believable job portraying the innocent adventure seeker who becomes Amin's personal physician.  The overly nave Garrigan manages to be simultaneously likeable and repugnant - not unlike Amin who quickly pulls Garrigan into his fold of political confidantes.  The film is less depressing than I thought it might be, and doesn't leave you utterly and uncontrollably embarrassed to be human like after watching Hotel Rwanda. The film has a somewhat lighthearted tone even while dealing with genocide.  The bulk of the film shows the decadence and party atmosphere of Amin's life, and his comically bazaar behavior, rather than graphically portraying the country's violence.  It clips along more like a fast paced thriller than heavy political drama.  Other recent films should take a lesson from this format -it is possible to create a serious film without boring the viewer to death.  That's not to say that the movie is fluffy- it leaves you with a sense of how easily a career choice, such as Dr.  Garrigan's, can go from blissful adventure, to genocidal complicity.  The viewer leaves with a sense of the rapidity, and ease, with which a country can turn from nationalistic excitement to dictatorial deadliness.

1056808,A2ZX6GW8WL5AG3,B000NIVJF4,jimmy_rants@yahoo,"[2, 2]","Forrest Whitaker is the reason to see this film, his portrayal of the jovial psychopath General Idi Amin Dada is not just a dead mimmick, but a reincarnation of the African general who made great press with his clownish antics while hiding his genocidal agenda from his adoring press corps until it was too late.The era was fascinating and it was hard not to root for what seemed to be legitimate nationalism and anti-imperialism by Amin.Great Britain had plundered Uganda as a colony, bringing technolgy and education to few while empowering illiterate arm breakers like Amin into their colonial armies. First the Ugandan Asians took the brunt of Amins coup, later the Ugandan people, with casualties of Amin in the hundreds of thousands.This film starts strong and is photgraphed vividly, capturing the Third World condition and the elites who live above it. When one of those elites speaks badly about Amin to the young naive doctor whose relationship with Amin the film is based upon,it is easy to discount his criticism as typical of selfish and racsist colonialists- neither the viewer or the doctor want to believe him.When it becomes apparent that Amins policies are becoming more savage by the day, it becomes too late for the doctor and too late for Uganda.

I may not agree with their five-star rating, however, I can see why some people would opt to rate it that.  I can also see why many viewers disliked it as well.  For me, this film is definitely worth renting and I am even considering purchasing it just to watch Forest Whitaker again.  For I truly can't believe how great he was in this!Yes, the ""The Last King of Scotland"" has many flaws.  Yes, it is a bit far-fetched.  Yes, the main character in the film Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) drives you absolutely nuts at times with the some of the inane decisions he makes.  I mean, for a doctor, that guy really, really lacked common sense and scruples (I mean, how stupid do you have to be to have an affair with...? I'm not going to blow it for those of you who have yet to see this film).  This movie also gets a bit muddled mid-way through and in my opinion tends to lose focus after the first hour.  And finally, be prepared to see appalling, unsightly, violent scenes that might give you nightmares for weeks (at least I've been plagued by them)towards the end of the film.  However, all that being said, it's not a bad film to say the least all because of one amazing, tour-de-force performance by Mr. Forest Whitaker.I gotta tell you all, that ever since I saw this fine film last week I've been trying to rack my little brain into recalling a greater acting performance than Whitaker as Idi Amin.  Again, it's all relatively subjective, and of course open for debate, however, I don't know how anyone would argue that he doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the top three (I would love to hear other people's opinions in the comment section on their choice for top three best ever performances by a male actor).  After careful consideration and a whole lot of contemplation, these are my top three:  1) Whitaker as Idi Amin  2) Robert De Niro as Jake La Motta in ""Raging Bull""  3) Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" tied with Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles in ""Ray"".  This year the Academy Awards finally got it right in awarding Oscars to Whitaker and Helen Mirren (""The Queen"").  Of course, if they didn't get it right this year, they would have lost 100% credibility in my book.  This was their year without a doubt!By the way, I know that there are a lot of parents out there who let their kids watch 'R' rated movies.  If your kids are under 15 years old, do them a favor and don't let them watch this film.  Not yet at least.

The naive  Nicholas Garrigan arrives in Uganda in 1970 on a whim as a young doctor from Scotland and begins work in a village clinic. A chance meeting with Idi Amin promotes Garrigan to become personal doctor to Amin, and in a reflection of the psychotic Ugandan president, Garrigan also becomes Amin's ""most trusted advisor"".Everything about this film works. The interplay between the two leading actors is intensely dramatic and I was mesmerized by the performance of Dr. Garrigan by the young Scottish actor, James McAvoy. His character grows up in this film as Amin's remains the same....a child, as Garrigan puts it toward the end. McAvoy is superb and worth every moment of the two-hour film.Disturbing as some scenes are to watch, they are necessary to remind people of the brutality of Idi Amin's reign. Far from being the buffoon by which he was often characterized, Amin was a terrorist who happened to be president of Uganda. The final half hour has a crescendo of heart-pounding action and superb timing. Added to this film's appeal is the beautiful cinematography and the occasional Western-style music....with an African flair, of course.""The Last King of Scotland"" is an expansive work that succeeds on every level.

Knowing that Forest Whitaker won an Oscar for best lead for his role as Idi Amin and also having a good knowledge of the dictator and Uganda it was both fascinating and interesting to see if the film was faithful to the real events or just fiction to suit the watcher. It also seemed that very few people had actually seen the film and there were wild discussions around wether Forest Whitaker deserved the Oscar or not. The title itself refers to one of Amin's many titles he gave himself, since there was no ""King of Scotland"" he thought he could claim the title, this film is also loosely based on a book.The film tells the story about Idi Amin's Uganda 1971-1979 from the young doctor Nicolas Garrigan's (James McAvoy) experience as Amin's personal doctor and main councellor for a few years. The young Scotish doctor arrived to Uganda to work at a small hospital but eventually he get's invited by the Dictator who admires his courage and boldness after he killed a cow. They become good friends and there is nothing Amin won't do before asking Nicolas. He'll see both good and bad sides of Amin, like his hospitality, good speaches to the people and his sense of humour, but eventually it becomes inevitable even for a loyal friend like Nicolas to not realize what's going on in the country. Indians are sent away (thus destroying the economy), enemies are killed and even the Health Minister and it seems like all of the promises of Amin in the beginning of his reign were just empty promises. I don't know if there is any truth in the friendship between the two, but the rest is pretty much faithful to history and real events and the film itself was also shot in Uganda. Whitaker is brilliant as Idi Amin, with good makeup, African accent and gaining a few pounds he looks and acts exactly like him. Whitaker isn't playing Amin, He is Amin. The Oscar was certainly justified by his great archivement. James McAvoy is also great as Nicholas though, and perhaps he should have got nomitated too, it feels like Nicholas is actually playing the lead role cause everything is based after his experiences. Other small but worthwile roles are also played by Gillian Anderson as the wife of another Doctor and Keri Washington as one of Amin's three wifes.This film is defenitely worth a closer look, if you want to see a good film and also learn some History, this film is an excellent option. Even if the happenings surround Amin are brutal, there isn't that much violence as in Hotel Rwanda and Blood Diamond apart from a particular scene in the end of it. Needless to say, It's faithful to real events and there is also some great acting from Whitaker and McAvoy, but I wouldn't have mind even more of Amin and putting him more into the spotlight. However, it's worth checking out and it's defenitely a good film. But If you want to see more of Amin, check out some documentary about him, there are plenty and they're better.",4,The Story of Idi Amin,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,2994,"['was', 'thinking', 'seing', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'long', 'time', 'Knowing', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'lead', 'role', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'also', 'having', 'good', 'knowledge', 'dictator', 'Uganda', 'was', 'fascinating', 'interesting', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'faithful', 'real', 'events', 'just', 'fiction', 'suit', 'watcher', 'also', 'seemed', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'had', 'actually', 'seen', 'film', 'were', 'wild', 'discussions', 'wether', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'not', 'title', 'one', 'Amin', 'many', 'titles', 'gave', 'was', 'King', 'Scotland', 'thought', 'could', 'claim', 'title', 'film', 'also', 'loosely', 'based', 'book.The', 'film', 'story', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Uganda', '1971-1979', 'young', 'doctor', 'Nicolas', 'Garrigan', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'experience', 'Amin', 'personal', 'doctor', 'main', 'councellor', 'few', 'years', 'young', 'Scotish', 'doctor', 'arrived', 'Uganda', 'work', 'small', 'hospital', 'eventually', 'get', 'invited', 'Dictator', 'who', 'courage', 'boldness', 'killed', 'cow', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'nothing', 'Amin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'asking', 'Nicolas', ""'ll"", 'see', 'good', 'bad', 'sides', 'Amin', 'hospitality', 'good', 'speaches', 'people', 'sense', 'humour', 'eventually', 'inevitable', 'even', 'loyal', 'friend', 'Nicolas', 'not', 'realize', 'what', 'going', 'country', 'Indians', 'are', 'sent', 'away', 'thus', 'destroying', 'economy', 'enemies', 'are', 'killed', 'even', 'Health', 'Minister', 'promises', 'Amin', 'beginning', 'reign', 'were', 'just', 'empty', 'promises', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'truth', 'friendship', 'two', 'rest', 'pretty', 'much', 'faithful', 'history', 'real', 'events', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'Uganda', 'Whitaker', 'brilliant', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'good', 'makeup', 'African', 'accent', 'gaining', 'few', 'pounds', 'exactly', 'Whitaker', ""n't"", 'playing', 'Amin', 'Amin', 'Oscar', 'was', 'certainly', 'justified', 'great', 'archivement', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'also', 'great', 'Nicholas', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'got', 'nomitated', 'too', 'Nicholas', 'actually', 'playing', 'lead', 'role', 'cause', 'everything', 'based', 'experiences', 'Other', 'small', 'worthwile', 'roles', 'are', 'also', 'played', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'wife', 'Doctor', 'Keri', 'Washington', 'one', 'Amin', 'three', 'wifes.This', 'film', 'defenitely', 'worth', 'closer', 'look', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'film', 'also', 'learn', 'History', 'film', 'excellent', 'option', 'Even', 'happenings', 'Amin', 'are', 'brutal', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'violence', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'Blood', 'Diamond', 'apart', 'particular', 'scene', 'end', 'Needless', 'say', 'faithful', 'real', 'events', 'also', 'great', 'acting', 'Whitaker', 'McAvoy', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'mind', 'even', 'more', 'Amin', 'putting', 'more', 'spotlight', 'However', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'defenitely', 'good', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'Amin', 'check', 'out', 'documentary', 'are', 'plenty', ""'re"", 'better']",N/A

1056820,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000NIVJF4,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[4, 7]","*no spoilers*Idi Amin was one of the most ruthless dictators of the 20th Century. His reign of terror lasted for eight years and claimed more than 300,000 lives. ""The Last King of Scotland"" tells the journey of a Scottish doctor (Nicholas Garrigan) who traveled to Uganda, met Amin, witnessed the atrocities and wanted to escape from the nightmare of being with one of the most sadistic men in the world.Story:The adventurous Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is a newly graduated medical student who decides to leave his homeland Scotland to go to Uganda where he will improve his medical skills by helping the locals. He ends up in a small village and meets a western doctor Merritt (Adam Kotz) and his wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson) who he finds sexually attractive. Nicholas wanted to have an affair with her, but she rejects him.The new president Idi Amin shows up in the village to give a victory speech--Amin sounds promising and optimistic about his country--and Nicholas and Sarah are in the crowd to experience it. Amin ends his speech with cheers and applauses. As they are driving away from the gathering, a group of soldiers pull them over to explain that Amin got into a small accident and needs medical attention. Both are rushed to the scene--Amin hit a cow and only got a sore hand. Nicholas is the one who treats him and bandaged his hand. Amin likes his personality right away --probably because of what Nicholas did to the cow afterwards--and become friends. After a short time, he makes Nicholas his personal physician. What Nicholas doesn't know is that he is getting deeper and deeper involved in a world of madness and terror. Amin is not what he seems to be.Review:Skillful director Kevin Macdonald takes us back to the 1970s to show us one of the most brutal regimes of the 20th Century. He creates an atmosphere of political unrest, drama and fear in his new movie ""The Last King of Scotland."" The story focuses mostly on Nicholas' experiences in Uganda. A place where he thought could have a good time and practice his medical skills. We see him being a lady's man, partying and drinking with Amin who showed only one face to him. Slowly, he started to become aware of Amin's ""methods"" of dealing with his political enemies. Finally he meets the dark side of Amin--a paranoid psychopath and warmonger who turned Uganda into his personal country club. We like the way the movie shifts to survival mode for Nicholas who doesn't know what would happen to him if he stays with The Wild Man of Africa.Although Forest Whitaker physically doesn't look like Amin, he gives us one of the best performances of his career. He portrays Amin with power and realism. We can feel Amin's unstable personality through him. He is nominated for best actor--and rightly so. We also like the chemistry between Whitaker and McAvoy on screen--powerful as the characters they portray.The cinematography is another high point. The movie shows beautiful African landscapes and cities. The camerawork is impressive because we like the way it follows body language--like hands moving and quick close ups to the face--giving us a documentary-like style.The Verdict:Nothing went as expected for the young Dr. Garrigan who went to Uganda and found his personal hell. ""The Last King of Scotland"" is full of excellent performances, history and drama.

1056823,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000NIVJF4,Kaya Savas,"[30, 33]","MOVIE: Nicholas Garrigan is a free spirit young man who has just finished med school and is aching to get away from his parents. He spins the plastic globe in his room and lands his finger on Uganda. The movie jumps right there as he travels to a missionary to be a volunteer doctor. From the opening credits and his actions with Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson) at the missionary we can see that this character is immature and just looking for a fun way to live.One day he is stopped by the President's army because apparently the President is in need of a doctor. He drives up to find the President standing next to his car in the ditch and a dying longhorn bull laying on the side of the road. A giant deal is made over a simply bruised hand and during the chaos Nicholas takes the President's gun and puts the screaming animal out of its misery. I suppose it was the strength that Nicholas demonstrated then and there that appealed to Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). From that point on a new friendship is made as Amin takes Nicholas under his wing to be his personal physician. Nicholas is reluctant at first to accept the offer because he knows that the missionary is in need of his help much more than the charming dictator. Of course we can't forget that Nicholas wants to live the good life, and he cannot resist all that Amin offers him. He cannot resist temptation and gives in, practically selling his soul to the devil if you will. From that point things begin to escalate and Nicholas sees what Amin truly is, and that is a power hungry murderer.The story itself is an easy one to follow, and we immediately connect and relate to the main characters.  Director Kevin Macdonald gets us acquainted with Nicholas and Amin, so we sort of open up as an audience to them. We follow Nicholas' journey in that we accept Idi Amin as a fun loving and passionate leader. But as the story moves along we as an audience move away from both Nicholas and Amin. Nicholas's fatal flaw as a character is greed since he is easily tempted with material goods and the promises of fame and fortune, not to mention sexual temptation with one of the many wives of Amin. We begin to pity him for the moral mistakes he makes, but deep in our hearts we want him to survive because he was truly taken advantage of by a powerful figure. Paradise soon becomes hell, and a struggle to escape the closing grasp of darkness begins. The only flaw of the film was in its structure. Things move really quickly, it's a fast paced film, but I would have liked to linger a bit more with Nicholas' character at the missionary. I felt we jumped in way too fast, and the entire timeline of Idi Amin's reign felt like it occurred over a week. The film's events felt consecutive which made it feel like the entire film happened in a month, yet in actuality the timeline spans from 1971 to 1979.ACTING: Forest Whitaker gives the best performance of his career. You will not see such a captivating and authentic example of acting anywhere else. Will he win the Oscar? If it were up to me he would, but it's been hard to predict the Oscars the past few years. Now, I could go on and on about Forest Whitaker's performance, but then that would be injust to James McAvory. McAvory was introduced to American audiences last year when he played Mr. Tumnus in The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe. In this film he sells the character completely and makes him very accessible. His change of character once he figures out deep of a hole he has dug himself in is perfect for the film, and he gives an equally good performance as Whitaker. Fine acting from the two, very fine.BOTTOM LINE: Structural problems are minor and don't hinder the film enough to hurt its impact, the film is intense and captivating.

Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[5, 6]","Early on in ""The Last King of Scotland"", we're treated to a microscopic closeup of a mosquito about to pierce human skin.  The skin belongs to Scotsman Nicholas Garrigan, in Uganda for 48 hours shortly after his graduation from medical school for, as he has told another character, ""Helping others...and some fun and adventure."" The mosquito, obviously, is a foreshadowing device, both in terms of the pain Garrigan (as well as many in Uganda) will go through before the film's end; and in terms of how Uganda's new president, with whom Garrigan had a chance meeting the day before, will get under his skin and in his blood.Those old enough to remember well know both the snickers (Amin's full self-bestowed title was ""His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC,[Victorious Cross, made to look like a British medal] DSO, MC [Military Cross], Conqueror of the British Empire,in General, and of Uganda, in Particular;"" he also occasionally called himself ""King of Scotland"", hence the title)and terror Amin's character instilled .  This film does a brilliant job of capturing this, mostly due to Forrest Whitaker's portrayal, and his interaction with James McAvoy (Garrigan).  There is a moment at the beginning of each of their discussions when one isn't sure if we will see Amin, the jolly, gregarious ""good father""; or Amin, the roaring, wrathful dragon....the ""evil father,"" and one's stomach sinks, praying for Garrigan's sake we'll see the former.Not that Garrigan is a character who seems to deserve such prayer.  After coming to Uganda on a whim, he leaves the badly underserved health clinic he's committed two years to in the lurch to serve Amin (as McAvoy explains in the extra on the DVD, to the wet-behind-the-ears doctor, Amin's audacious praise,  and promise of comeraderie and confidences are too much for him to resist.) He is insulting to the British emmisary, then expects immediate help from him once Amin's jaws start to clamp down on him. He knowingly puts himself and others at risk of death. But most glaringly, his notice of the atrocities toward the Ugandan people, which start to become harder and harder to ignore, seems until the very end to be limited to how they affect him.Garrigan is a fictional character, but he serves as a mirror that allows us to see Amin in ways a simple biopic may not have been able to.  Moreover, perhaps in Garrigan, director Kevin MacDonald (and novel writer Giles Foden)wanted to remind us how the world itself turned away from Uganda during the Amin years, worrying only until things affected us.A special film not only for its important subject matter, but the acting, photography, and the beautiful Ugandan scenery (filmed almost entirely on location).",5,"Mirror, mirror....",1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,2754,"['Early', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', ""'re"", 'treated', 'microscopic', 'closeup', 'mosquito', 'pierce', 'human', 'skin', 'skin', 'belongs', 'Scotsman', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'Uganda', '48', 'hours', 'shortly', 'graduation', 'medical', 'school', 'told', 'character', 'Helping', 'others', 'fun', 'adventure', 'mosquito', 'obviously', 'foreshadowing', 'device', 'terms', 'pain', 'Garrigan', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'Uganda', 'will', 'go', 'before', 'film', 'end', 'terms', 'how', 'Uganda', 'new', 'president', 'whom', 'Garrigan', 'had', 'chance', 'meeting', 'day', 'will', 'get', 'skin', 'blood.Those', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'well', 'know', 'snickers', 'Amin', 'full', 'self-bestowed', 'title', 'was', 'Excellency', 'President', 'Life', 'Field', 'Marshal', 'Al', 'Hadji', 'Doctor', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Dada', 'VC', '[', 'Victorious', 'Cross', 'made', 'look', 'British', 'medal', ']', 'DSO', 'MC', '[', 'Military', 'Cross', ']', 'Conqueror', 'British', 'Empire', 'General', 'Uganda', 'Particular', 'also', 'occasionally', 'called', 'King', 'Scotland', 'hence', 'title', 'Amin', 'character', 'instilled', 'film', 'brilliant', 'job', 'capturing', 'mostly', 'due', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'portrayal', 'interaction', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Garrigan', 'moment', 'beginning', 'discussions', 'when', 'one', ""n't"", 'sure', 'will', 'see', 'Amin', 'jolly', 'gregarious', 'good', 'father', 'Amin', 'roaring', 'wrathful', 'dragon', 'evil', 'father', 'one', 'stomach', 'sinks', 'praying', 'Garrigan', 'sake', ""'ll"", 'see', 'former.Not', 'Garrigan', 'character', 'who', 'deserve', 'such', 'prayer', 'coming', 'Uganda', 'whim', 'badly', 'underserved', 'health', 'clinic', 'committed', 'two', 'years', 'lurch', 'serve', 'Amin', 'McAvoy', 'extra', 'DVD', 'wet-behind-the-ears', 'doctor', 'Amin', 'audacious', 'praise', 'promise', 'comeraderie', 'confidences', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'resist', 'insulting', 'British', 'emmisary', 'then', 'immediate', 'help', 'once', 'Amin', 'jaws', 'start', 'clamp', 'down', 'knowingly', 'others', 'risk', 'death', 'most', 'glaringly', 'notice', 'atrocities', 'Ugandan', 'people', 'start', 'become', 'harder', 'harder', 'ignore', 'very', 'end', 'be', 'limited', 'how', 'affect', 'him.Garrigan', 'fictional', 'character', 'mirror', 'see', 'Amin', 'ways', 'simple', 'biopic', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'Moreover', 'perhaps', 'Garrigan', 'director', 'Kevin', 'MacDonald', 'novel', 'writer', 'Giles', 'Foden', 'wanted', 'remind', 'how', 'world', 'turned', 'away', 'Uganda', 'Amin', 'years', 'worrying', 'only', 'things', 'affected', 'us.A', 'special', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'important', 'subject', 'matter', 'acting', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'Ugandan', 'scenery', 'filmed', 'almost', 'entirely', 'location']",N/A

One wanted distraction and this movie provided exactly that, buoyed by James McAvoy's delightful performance as Nicholas Garrigan, a fictional doctor drawn into Idi Amin's web of paranoia and nation-building.  A title tells us this movie is ""Inspired by Real Events"" but it doesn't let on that its entire frame story is a fictional construct.  We get to see Idi Amin from his doctor's point of view, only we don't of course, that's all just a story-telling gambit.  Those of you who are looking for some sort of docudrama of real events had better look elsewhere.  This is just the same olf story of, LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.Nicholas is a fun-loving hooligan from Scotland with a weakness for healing young children and taking sexual advantage of all the willing black and white women in Africa.  It's 1972 after all, no AIDS on the horizon, so as soon as Nick gets to Uganda he smiles that insouciant grin at a fellow passenger on one of those funky, strap goats to the roof buses they have in movies about Africa, and instantly the two of them are hard at it in a bus shelter.  He's adorable and deserves a special Oscar all of his own for, oh I don't know, cutest grin.  Next up, Gillian Anderson playing the Angelina Jolie part of the heroic white doctor's ignored wife, smouldering in the dust while children not her own die all around with flies on their eyelids.  Her name, Sarah Merritt, also a fictional character.  She falls hard for young Doctor Galligan, and her desire for him only increases as he charms the native children and proves himself a fit ally for her husband.  Before long, he's trying to kiss her under the Ugandan moon, and she gets all skittery like a sixteen year old virgin.The uproar about Forest Whitaker's performance is justified.  He really hollers great, in a new range of basso profundo we haven't heard out of him before.  Voice lessons helped him ease his way into a challenging part, but other than that it's the same old Forest we've loved since THE CRYING GAME and that movie where he's a psychic.  His eyes twitching in different directions, his vapid grin that freezes into a rictus of calculated ire.

Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[20, 23]","A funny thing happened to me after I finished a screening of ""The Last King of Scotland,"" I thought about the Iraq war.  I thought of the war because here is a movie about a dictator, who got the people of his country on his side, took over the country, and then caused great misery throughout his country.  Saddam was a monster, but to many Iraqi's he was a man for the people before he went crazy on them.  ""The Last King of Scotland"" revolves around Nicholas Garrigan, the son of a wealthy doctor in Scotland who just received his own doctor's degree.  He's supposed to go into the family business with dear old dad, but feels he is called somewhere else, and ends up in Ugandan, Africa.  Nicholas has come to Ugandan during a time where Ugandan is about to become a republic, under the leadership of their new president Idi Amin.Nicholas hears Amin speak at a rally, and falls in love with the guy.  Here's a leader who's charming, funny, and good with kids.  When Nicholas meets Amin, he is pleased to discover that Amin takes a liking to Nicholas too.  So much so, that Amin makes Nicholas his personal doctor and eventually his personal advisor.  Nicholas gets treated like royalty by Amin, and feels proud to be contributing to Ugandans' bright future.  However, as time goes on, Amin starts showing signs that he is not the giant teddy bear he appears to be.  After a couple of Amin's men question his true intentions, the men disappear.  A British journalist tells Nicholas to keep an eye on Amin, claimed that Amin had not only killed hundreds of people, but that ""they are getting very sloppy too.  They aren't bothering digging graves anymore, choosing to just feed most people to the crocodiles.""As the movie goes on, we too start to worry about Amin's sanity.  We see more and more of his outbursts, and when Nicholas requests to go home, Amin gives him a cold stare that shot daggers into my heart.  It's at this point Nicholas realizes what a dangerous man Amin really is, and watching the movie from an audience perspective, we suspect that it could be too late for Nicholas to get out of the situation he has gotten himself into.  Nicholas Garrigan is played by James McAvoy, who is best known as Mr. Tumnus the Faun in ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, & The Wardrobe,"" and he gives a star making performance in this movie.  While we see the signs way in advance that Nicholas may be getting too close and personal with a dangerous man, we can't deny that he's living a good lifestyle.  With the eagerness of a kid owning his first car, McAvoy goes through the perfect notions of someone who is treated like a king himself, before he realizes the danger he might be in.Gillian Anderson, who has a minor role as Dr. Sarah Merrit, warns Nicholas that Amin might not be as nice as he seems, and halfway through the movie, we'll discover that she was right.  The star of the movie though is Forrest Whitaker as the murderous Idi Amin.  With a thick accent, playful modes, and terrifying moments where the character is raving like a madman, Whitaker will most likely win the Academy Award for Best Actor come Oscar time.  While Whitaker's character is only in about two-thirds of the movie, his presence is larger then life, and is one of those truly memorable performances that will linger in your mind years after the movie has faded from your memory.  What we ultimately have with ""The Last King of Scotland"" is the story of a man who could have been a true leader, but chose the path of a dictator.Many murderous dictators exist in the world today, and like Idi Amin, they too most likely charmed their countrymen until they got into power, where their true colors came to light.  I warn you now, this is not a movie you will go to see for entertainment.  Oh sure, the first half of the film has you smiling quite a bit, but the final hour is grim, dark, and there is at least one torture scene that is the most graphic torture scene I've seen since Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of The Christ.""  Most people will not want to finish ""The Last King of Scotland,"" or even want to see it in the first place, but it is a fascinating historical piece that reminds us of how lucky we are to live in America, or any free country, away from dictators like Idi Amin.",4,Mark Whitaker Down For An Oscar Nab Next Year!,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,4286,"['funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'finished', 'screening', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'thought', 'Iraq', 'war', 'thought', 'war', 'here', 'movie', 'dictator', 'who', 'got', 'people', 'country', 'side', 'took', 'country', 'then', 'caused', 'great', 'misery', 'country', 'Saddam', 'was', 'monster', 'many', 'Iraqi', 'was', 'man', 'people', 'went', 'crazy', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'around', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'son', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'Scotland', 'who', 'just', 'received', 'own', 'doctor', 'degree', 'supposed', 'go', 'family', 'business', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'feels', 'called', 'somewhere', 'else', 'up', 'Ugandan', 'Africa', 'Nicholas', 'come', 'Ugandan', 'time', 'where', 'Ugandan', 'become', 'republic', 'leadership', 'new', 'president', 'Idi', 'Amin.Nicholas', 'Amin', 'speak', 'rally', 'love', 'guy', 'Here', 'leader', 'who', 'charming', 'funny', 'good', 'kids', 'When', 'Nicholas', 'Amin', 'pleased', 'discover', 'Amin', 'liking', 'Nicholas', 'too', 'So', 'much', 'Amin', 'Nicholas', 'personal', 'doctor', 'eventually', 'personal', 'advisor', 'Nicholas', 'treated', 'royalty', 'Amin', 'feels', 'proud', 'be', 'contributing', 'Ugandans', 'bright', 'future', 'However', 'time', 'Amin', 'showing', 'signs', 'not', 'giant', 'teddy', 'bear', 'be', 'couple', 'Amin', 'men', 'question', 'true', 'intentions', 'men', 'disappear', 'British', 'journalist', 'tells', 'Nicholas', 'keep', 'eye', 'Amin', 'claimed', 'Amin', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'killed', 'hundreds', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'very', 'sloppy', 'too', 'are', ""n't"", 'bothering', 'digging', 'graves', 'anymore', 'choosing', 'just', 'feed', 'most', 'people', 'crocodiles', 'movie', 'too', 'start', 'worry', 'Amin', 'sanity', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'outbursts', 'when', 'Nicholas', 'go', 'home', 'Amin', 'cold', 'stare', 'shot', 'daggers', 'heart', 'point', 'Nicholas', 'what', 'dangerous', 'man', 'Amin', 'really', 'watching', 'movie', 'audience', 'perspective', 'suspect', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'Nicholas', 'get', 'situation', 'gotten', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'played', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'Mr.', 'Tumnus', 'Faun', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'star', 'making', 'performance', 'movie', 'see', 'signs', 'way', 'advance', 'Nicholas', 'may', 'be', 'getting', 'too', 'close', 'personal', 'dangerous', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'living', 'good', 'lifestyle', 'eagerness', 'kid', 'owning', 'first', 'car', 'McAvoy', 'perfect', 'notions', 'someone', 'who', 'treated', 'king', 'danger', 'might', 'be', 'in.Gillian', 'Anderson', 'who', 'minor', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Sarah', 'Merrit', 'Nicholas', 'Amin', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'nice', 'halfway', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'was', 'right', 'star', 'movie', 'though', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'murderous', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'thick', 'accent', 'playful', 'modes', 'terrifying', 'moments', 'where', 'character', 'raving', 'madman', 'Whitaker', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time', 'Whitaker', 'character', 'only', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'presence', 'larger', 'then', 'life', 'one', 'truly', 'memorable', 'performances', 'will', 'linger', 'mind', 'years', 'movie', 'faded', 'memory', 'What', 'ultimately', 'have', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'leader', 'chose', 'path', 'dictator.Many', 'murderous', 'dictators', 'exist', 'world', 'today', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'too', 'most', 'likely', 'charmed', 'countrymen', 'got', 'power', 'where', 'true', 'colors', 'came', 'light', 'warn', 'now', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'go', 'see', 'entertainment', 'Oh', 'sure', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'smiling', 'quite', 'bit', 'final', 'hour', 'grim', 'dark', 'least', 'one', 'torture', 'scene', 'most', 'graphic', 'torture', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Most', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'finish', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'even', 'want', 'see', 'first', 'place', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'piece', 'how', 'lucky', 'are', 'live', 'America', 'free', 'country', 'away', 'dictators', 'Idi', 'Amin']",N/A
1056830,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000NIVJF4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[111, 120]","Before going any further, let's be upfront about what ""The Last King of Scotland"" is. It is essentially a fictional thriller, with a political/historical backdrop. With Forest Whitaker's highly touted performance as real-life Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, it may be natural to assume that the film is biographical in nature, but it is not. While many of the events portrayed within the film are based on actual incidents, the primary story involving Amin's white Scottish doctor (James McAvoy who is the actual lead performance) is a complete work of fiction by ""Scotland"" novelist Giles Foden. Interestingly enough, the original conception for this character was loosely based on the valet from Moliere's ""Don Juan""--but he was promoted to a doctor, in this story, to generate more compelling ethical questions. With that clarification in place, ""The Last King of Scotland"" is one heck of a ride--it is a riveting thriller that also manages to provide relevant insight into the complexity of Amin's private and public personas.The story framework and basic setup is not unfamiliar, we've seen it in many other genres--from political films, financial thrillers, corrupt cop stories, mob portraits, and even in supernatural hokum. Basically, an ambitious young man is seduced by wealth and power. Falling under the spell of an engaging mentor, he buys into the glorious lifestyle that he has always dreamed of--sacrificing a bit of himself, and making some moral compromises, in the process. Ultimately, though, the situation gets out of hand, but it may be too late. He is now complicit in the same crimes he wishes to extricate himself from. In this case, McAvoy plays a Scottish medic who arrives in Uganda, on impulse, to ""make a difference."" As Amin is rising to power, McAvoy gets caught up in public sentiment and a chance meeting brings doctor and dictator together. Amin is fascinated by the young man's brash and bold nature, and the doctor is enthralled by Amin's power and charm. Forming a strong initial bond, things soon start unraveling as Amin's real nature starts to become more clear.The power of ""Last King"" comes from the fact that this bond, this relationship, is actually quite believable. You understand what would bring these two men together, and ultimately what would drive them apart. Credit the screenplay for these interactions, but it's also the actors who breathe life into a great story. Forest Whitaker, having won 1042 acting prizes for this role (OK, maybe not quite that many), is indeed phenomenal as Amin. Expertly capturing both his charm and his dangerous paranoia, it is a spot-on recreation of a man who loved the limelight. If you aren't familiar with the actual Amin, check out Barbet's Schroeder's documentary ""General Idi Amin Dada"" (available from Criterion) to see just how astute his portrait is. McAvoy, who some find less convincing, is actually the dramatic center of the film, however. It is his evolution from callow youth to coconspirator to victim that the film revolves around. I, for one, thought he brought a lot to the role. His casual indifference and moral ambiguity heighten this tale--it's not just a routine good versus evil story.Anyway, with great performances, realistic action sequences, and a tight script--I really enjoyed ""Last King."" It was a thriller that I found to be genuinely thrilling, and the Ugandan backdrop is portrayed perfectly. At times harrowing and brutal, this bit of fiction succeeds not only as rousing entertainment, but as a relevant historical portrait as well.

All the blood, guts, and gore I heard people talking about was almost non-existant. I was expecting to see the real story of Idi Amin, something harsh and brutal, but what I saw was a disapppointment. I didn't get to see any of those things. This movie is about his pyhsician..NOT HIM! Frankly, I this movie didn't show me anything but the rantings of a madman, and you sort of have to use your imagination for the rest of it. It had just a few scenes that make you cringe. Overall, I think that it failed to capture the whole story. They told you about the killings throughout the movie, but they never actually show you him killing anyone. I'm sorry, I just didn't get the full effect that I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, Forest Whitaker is awesome as always, and he did a good job playing this role, I just wasn't impressed with this movie. Frankly, I'm not the type that gets easily moved by blood, guts and gore, but if you're gonna make a movie that is based on a real person and real events then you shouldn't hold back. I couldn't help but think they could've taken this a step further, but they chose not to. I think that it focuses more on Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, and how he was mezmerized by the person he thought Idi Amin was in the beginning, so much to where he even became his personal physician. Then, he slowly realizes that the man that he has so much respect and admiration for indeed a murderous madman that's corrupted by power. I think I was expecting this movie to go more into depth about the vicious tyrant Amin was, and show more of his tirades and massacres, instead of them just telling me about it. They never show him refer to himself as ""The Last King of Scotland"" the press said that's what they heard he was calling himself. The stories suggest that he was a cannibal. I saw nothing to support or deny that either.  This review is only an opinion, and we all know what they are like, but I just don't share the same feelings that a lot of other viewers did. On top of that, the documetary on the DVD ""Capturing Idi Amin"" doesn't make him seem so bad. In fact, it seems like despite the stories we have heard about the killings of over 300,000 Ugandans a lot of them still love and respect him, and some still consider him a good man and a hero.",2,Overrated!!,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,2357,"['hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'dull', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore', 'heard', 'people', 'talking', 'was', 'almost', 'non-existant', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'real', 'story', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'something', 'harsh', 'brutal', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'disapppointment', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'things', 'movie', 'pyhsician..NOT', 'HIM', 'Frankly', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'anything', 'rantings', 'madman', 'sort', 'have', 'use', 'imagination', 'rest', 'had', 'just', 'few', 'scenes', 'make', 'cringe', 'Overall', 'think', 'failed', 'capture', 'whole', 'story', 'told', 'killings', 'movie', 'never', 'actually', 'show', 'killing', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'was', 'expecting', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'awesome', 'always', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'role', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'movie', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'not', 'type', 'easily', 'moved', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore', ""'re"", 'gon', 'make', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'real', 'events', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'step', 'further', 'chose', 'not', 'think', 'more', 'Dr.', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'how', 'was', 'mezmerized', 'person', 'thought', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'was', 'beginning', 'so', 'much', 'where', 'even', 'became', 'personal', 'physician', 'Then', 'slowly', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'respect', 'admiration', 'indeed', 'murderous', 'madman', 'corrupted', 'power', 'think', 'was', 'expecting', 'movie', 'go', 'more', 'depth', 'vicious', 'tyrant', 'Amin', 'was', 'show', 'more', 'tirades', 'massacres', 'instead', 'just', 'telling', 'never', 'show', 'refer', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'press', 'said', 'what', 'heard', 'was', 'calling', 'stories', 'suggest', 'was', 'cannibal', 'saw', 'nothing', 'support', 'deny', 'review', 'only', 'opinion', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'same', 'feelings', 'lot', 'other', 'viewers', 'did', 'top', 'documetary', 'DVD', 'Capturing', 'Idi', 'Amin', ""n't"", 'make', 'seem', 'so', 'bad', 'fact', 'stories', 'have', 'heard', 'killings', '300,000', 'Ugandans', 'lot', 'still', 'love', 'respect', 'still', 'consider', 'good', 'man', 'hero']",N/A

Although based on real events, this portrait of the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is a fictional story set against a painfully real background. Still, what it lacks in factual detail it makes up for with its unnerving sense of reality, its tense (and at times terrifying) plot, and some of the most astounding acting ever filmed. The result is a harrowing tale of power, corruption, greed, the sinister danger that lurks behind charismatic politicians, and the most pitiful lows of human cruelty. At the same time, it's a genuinely engaging and darkly entertaining thriller. The film is full of suspense, with a twisting narrative and some fantastic tension-and-release dynamics.Now, as to those performances: As you've probably already heard, Forest Whitaker's portrayal of Amin is nothing short of pure genius: Even amid a startlingly capable cast, he manages to steal the show, dripping with charisma, wit, barely suppressed insanity, and a hypnotic sort of megalomania. He fills the screen with dangerous charm and ominous magnetism. The result is an absolutely unforgettable performance. And to think, my first introduction to this guy was when he was hosting the ""new, new Twilight Zone!""

His next (non-documentary) film is ""State of Play"" that stars Brad Pitt.  He does an excellent job with this film, bringing the horrific reign of Idi Amin to the screen with enough humor & humanity to make it watchable.  Jeremy Brock, who did the screenplays for Judy Dench's ""Mrs. Brown"" & Cate Blanchett's ""Charlotte Gray,"" does a good job of adapting Giles Foden's novel into a workable film.This may well be Forest Whitaker's most memorable role, despite such excellent work as in the Clint Eastwood picture of Charlie Parker's life titled ""Bird"" for which he won the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival & in a lesser-known dramaGhost Dog - The Way of the Samurai.  In addition to the Oscar for this film, he won similar awards from the British Academy Awards, the Golden Globe & film critics awards from Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York Film Critics + NY Online Critics, Oklahoma, Phoenix & Washington D.C.  Idi Amin is known as one of the most brutal dictators in modern history, joining Lenin, Hitler, Pol Pot & perhaps Sadam Hussein in that nefarious category.  In order for the film to work, Brock's screenplay had to show the various levels for the character, which Whitaker delivers with a cinematic payload.  We see the humor, the paranoia, the immaturity, the ruthlessness & the bravado of the character.  It is an amazing performance.James McAvoy, who had a small part in ""Wimbledon"" and played in ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch & the Wardrobe,"" plays the film's protagonist, Dr. Nicholas Garrin.  He's a young recent graduate trying to escape the esteemed shadow of his father in Scotland, which makes him decide to arrive in Uganda, where he is ignorant of the politics.  On one hand, it seems unbelievable that a character could graduate as a doctor and have such little maturity.  On the other hand, we watch TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"" & see varying levels of maturity among doctors.  McAvoy delivers a good performance as he grows up considerably before our eyes.  We learn to care about the character and wonder what the next chapter of his life might be like.  McAvoy will next be in ""Becoming Jane,"" opposite Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen.Of the smaller roles, there are some standout performances.  Kerry Washington, who breezed through two ""Fantastic Four"" films, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" & played Della Charles opposite Jamie Foxx in ""Ray,"" plays Idi Amin's wife who is the mother of an epileptic child.  In caring for her child and in her position as ""third wife,"" she is seduced by Dr. Garrigan and pays the price.Gillian Anderson, who will forever be known from her work on the TV show ""X-Files,"" has a stunningly different blonde look and does a good job in this cameo.  Simon McBurney from ""The Manchurian Candidate"" & the upcoming ""The Golden Compass,"" plays the disagreeable British diplomat Stone to perfection.  We really hate him, as we are supposed to do.  David Oyelowo's cameo part as Dr. Junju who is the conscience of the clinic does an excellent job.  Stephen Rwangyezi as Amin's assistant Jonah Wasswa does good work in a small part.  ""The Last King of Scotland"" is not always pleasant, but Whitaker's celebrated performance makes this essential viewing.

During his reign, three hundred thousand of his countrymen were killed.  This flawlessly-executed (no pun intended) film is a snapshot of those years through the eyes of Nicolas, a brash young doctor from Scotland who travels to Uganda via a random spin of the globe.  At first joining a medical mission desperate for doctors, he soon falls under the spell of the eloquent and unique general Amin. The Last King of Scotland title refers to Amin's years in the British Army, and his penchant for kilts.In this mesmerizing and alternately funny and chilling film, there are a host of high caliber perfomances, including Gillian Anderson (Scully from the X-Files) as a harried doctor who represents Nicolas' conscience, which he gladly - and somewhat understandably - abandons for the posh life as private doctor to Amin and his three wives and children.History is accurate here, including Amin's macabre penchant for cutting off the legs of his enemies, and putting the right leg to the left side of the body, and the right leg on the left side.  Also shown is the tense drama that was Entebe Airport, when Palestian gunmen, heeding Amin's promise of asylum, hijacked an airplane of Israeli civilians.This film was made entirely in Uganda, with Ugandans making up the supporting cast and the hundreds of extras.

1056842,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B000NIVJF4,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[60, 64]","Jeremy Brock, who is a television writer, wrote a fine script a few years ago for the film ""Mrs. Brown"", a tale of Queen Victoria, starring Dame Judi Dench.  Brock gets another chance to deliver in his work with ""The Last King of Scotland"". This time his director is Kevin MacDonald. MacDonald has not yet found fame, but his 1999 documentary, ""One Day in September"", about the killings at the 1972 Munich Olympics put Spielberg's ""Munich"" to shame. MacDonald uses a semi-documentary style in creating the arresting film that is ""The Last King of Scotland"". So, too, like ""Mrs. Brown"", is the film made memorable by a performance so compelling it will be the stuff of legends, and an arresting supporting performance. ""The Last King"", which saw limited release, came back to many American theaters in the past month as a tribute to the Golden Globe and the newly won Oscar by Forest Whitaker for his role as Amin. In his shadow is a fine performance from James McAvoy as the FICTIONAL, callow Dr. Garrigan, the personal doctor to Amin.Dr. Garrigan meets Amin just as he comes into power, and quite by accident, is connected to the arresting Amin who loves all things Scottish. In 1971, at the time the movie begins, Amin overthrew then dictator Obote in a coup that was lauded both in Uganda and abroad. Obote supporters persisted in Uganda and Tanzania, attempting to assassinate Amin more than once. Amin quickly morphed from a benevolent commander of what he envisioned as a democratic, western-type rule, to a treacherous paranoid. Ethnic violence resulted in a wave of tortures and assassinations throughout the country. Amin turned on the country's Asian (mainly Indian) population and cast out Hindus, Muslims and Jews. He looted their businesses.Aligning himself with Muammar al-Qaddafi, the Soviet Union and the PLO, Amin was shunned by the British government and the foreign press. His behavior became more and more unhinged as he attempted to keep close to the customs he had once revered by dressing in Scottish garb, throwing fetes with Scottish themes, and finally resorting to costumes of all kinds. In 1976, PLO supporters hijacked a French plane and 256 hostages were held at Entebbe, on the ground in Uganda. Amin visited the hostages and finally brokered the release of all but Israelis and Jews. Israel launched a rescue, which has been featured many times on film and in books, which freed all but one of the hostages, and 3 which had been killed by Ugandans under Amin's auspices. The world shunned Amin, and the knowledge of his practices of genocide (estimates of Ugandan's killed in the 8 years of his regime range from 80,000 to 300,00) became known. All charm and pretense disappeared in his last years, and his increasing paranoia and illness rendered him a monster. He was driven into exile by Tanzanian-Ugandan forces in 1979.In the film, against this backdrop comes the story of Amin's friendship and leverage on young Dr. Garrigan, who initially is blinded by the charm that Amin exhibits, and who slowly comes face to face with his erratic behavior and the personal threat that Amin poses to the Doctor. The film take us through Garrigan's early denials, and later to his bleak despair, unmindful affair with one of Amin's wives, and his eventual torture. It culminates in the scene at Entebbe, with the world watching.While the relationship deteriorates, the viewer is fascinated with Whitaker's captivating leadership and vision for a bright future for Uganda. He's persuasive, confident, and exudes charm and intelligence. He yells and shows his anger and penchant for violence with no remorse. Contrarily, he's childlike in his delight for things. He's a man for all seasons and Whitaker, with his powerful physique and a voice he is said to have taken lessons to enhance, is perfect for the role. As paranoia, greed and fame set in, Whitaker dissembles into the real Amin  - his eyes twitch, adrenaline makes him shudder and lope, he generates an aura of danger and unpredictability that has seldom been seen on the screen before. He IS Amin. McAvoy plays him off with the dawning realization of the danger his is in and his need to placate the man, while continuing to make reckless decisions that will eventually cause Amin to turn on him.Surrounded by the scenic beauty of the real Uganda, the red earth, the air that shimmers, the lushness of the territory and the beauty and terror of her people, Whitaker takes the film to a stunning and brutal conclusion that leaves you shaking in your seat.There are some editing flaws, notably in Whitaker's action scenes, some decisions made by the director that make the film sometimes a documentary, sometimes a feature. Ultimately the film is not great, just grand. And Whitaker, who has given us legendary work before in ""The Crying Game"" and ""Bird"",( and a 20 year career of dedication to acting as a craft) deserved every award he received this season.A fascinating film, sure to be a popular DVD.",4,The film showcases a truly spectacular performance....,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,4985,"['Jeremy', 'Brock', 'who', 'television', 'writer', 'wrote',

If you are not of the generation when he was in power, you probably don't know much about him, and this portrayal of Uganda at that time is excellent.  He is dynamic, charismatic, powerful, and intense.  His accent is authentic, watching him you feel like you are watching Idi Amin in the flesh.The story sucks you in, before you know it you feel like you are in Uganda in the 70's.  To have more of an understanding of what happened during that period of time is eye-opening, and as a pupil of Western Culture I feel like I know something more about the history of Africa, and its' effects on the world.

The Last King of Scotland understands that this is the essential, and essentially unanswerable, question of who and what we are.While McAvoy, as Garrigan, is wonderful as the smart, but self-deceiving doctor, his real accomplishment is holding his own in the face of as astonishing performance by Forest Whitaker as dictator Idi Amin. Whitaker brings to life a multi-dimensional, manipulative psychopath drunk with the thrill of adulation and power. Garrigan becomes more than Amin's personal physician, and, eventually, emerges so enmeshed in the psychopathology of Amin that, in defending the indefensible, he is defending himself and the monstrous adoptive father he will ultimately betray.Gillian Anderson, of X-Files fame, is emaciated and almost unrecognizable, with a brief, and fairly weak, turn as the wife of a clinic doctor and the target of Garrigan's blunt efforts at seduction. Kerry Washington, in contrast, shows startling power as the elegant and extraordinarily beautiful wife that bore two of Amin's sons and, ignored by him, falls into a torrid affair with Garrigan.The ending sequence of The Last King of Scotland is brutal and difficult to watch, but ultimately redemptive. Like another great film of 2006, Pan's Labyrinth, it is a very adult meditation on the nature of our humanity in all of its nobility and brutality.",5,The heart of darkness.,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,1887,"['Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'story', 'shallow', 'narcissistic', 'young', 'doctor', 'who', 'remote', 'clinic', 'Uganda', 'better', 'reason', 'escape', 'father', 'shadow', 'course', 'great', 'stories', 'Dr.', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'trotting', 'globe', 'descending', 'own', 'subconscious', 'place', 'populated', 'angels', 'demons', 'lurk', 'Uganda', 'help', 'poor', 'sleep', 'around', 'play', 'out', 'paternalistic', 'fantasy', 'something', 'else', 'Does', 'could', 'Garrigan', 'even', 'know', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'essential', 'essentially', 'unanswerable', 'question', 'who', 'what', 'are.While', 'McAvoy', 'Garrigan', 'wonderful', 'smart', 'self-deceiving', 'doctor', 'real', 'accomplishment', 'holding', 'own', 'face', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'dictator', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Whitaker', 'life', 'multi-dimensional', 'manipulative', 'psychopath', 'drunk', 'thrill', 'adulation', 'power', 'Garrigan', 'more', 'Amin', 'personal', 'physician', 'eventually', 'so', 'enmeshed', 'psychopathology', 'Amin', 'defending', 'indefensible', 'defending', 'monstrous', 'adoptive', 'father', 'will', 'ultimately', 'betray.Gillian', 'Anderson', 'X-Files', 'fame', 'emaciated', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'brief', 'fairly', 'weak', 'turn', 'wife', 'clinic', 'doctor', 'target', 'Garrigan', 'blunt', 'efforts', 'seduction', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'contrast', 'startling', 'power', 'elegant', 'extraordinarily', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'bore', 'two', 'Amin', 'sons', 'ignored', 'torrid', 'affair', 'Garrigan.The', 'ending', 'sequence', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'brutal', 'difficult', 'watch', 'ultimately', 'redemptive', 'great', 'film', '2006', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'very', 'adult', 'meditation', 'nature', 'humanity', 'nobility', 'brutality']",N/A

1056847,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B000NIVJF4,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[25, 51]","This is a terrible film. Though Uganda and Idi Amin are used by name, what is shown in the film has really nothing to do with the real events of the 1970s in that country. Real events are woven in, but the facts are almost always wrong. In the end, what you get is actors trying to present a cartoon image of the American television news image of Idi Amin combined with modern political spin.As lead character, we get the totally unbelievable Nicholas Garrigan. He has bad ""traditional"" parents so he decides at random to go be a doctor in Uganda. But we quickly discover that he is less interested in altruism than in being a sexual tourist in a very poor country. Gillian Anderson is used as a walk-through character. She seems to be there only so Garrigan can hit on her unsuccessfully.In the first totally unrealistic scene, Garrigan meets Amin, medically treats him and then grabs a gun and shoots an animal because it was making noise. Things like this just don't happen. It certainly never happened in Uganda.Even more unrealistically, Amin suddenly makes him his personal doctor and Garrigan accepts for no clear reason. We are supposed to believe that Amin somehow is charming him into the job. The problem is that Amin was a clown. He never charmed anyone in his life. What he did was often make a fool of himself in front of western reporters who gladly played up the image of african leader as childlike clown.Garrigan, true to his horrible nature, then embarks on a campaign to seduce one of Amin's wives. The only words for that are nonsensical and sucidal. And because Garrigan is just that kind of guy, he quickly gets her pregnant. In the meantime, for no particular reason he starts buying into Amin's paranoia and starts denouncing others to Amin who are then killed.Again, just because he is that kind of guy, Garrigan seems to want Amin's wife to keep the child. Then we go through some conveluted plot so she can be killed by Amin. Garrigan, who isn't every morally bothered much by anything else, gets angry at Amin over the death of the wife. Why he should be angry at Amin given that his own continuous irresponsibility is not clear.We are also repeatedly told that the world doesn't know how bad Amin is or the situation in Uganda was. Amin is ""charming"" all the reporters of the world just has he charmed Garrigan. Problem is, thats historically not what happened.Everyone knew what was happening in Uganda and how bad Amin was. He didn't charm anyone or fool much of anyone. The only people who bought into what Amin was selling were the idiot 1970s far-left crowd who were in love with any african dictator as long as he carried a gun, mouthed slogans about colonial oppression and talked about the new africa they were building.Garrigan eventually stumbles into the israeli hostage drama at the airport. The details of the event are all wrong, but at this point what does it matter. Garrigan tries to poison Amin in an unrealistic and clumsy way through ""instant death"" pills. He then gets taken into the duty-free shop at the airport for an overly elaborate and highly unrealistic torture scene. Of course he survives and with the help of another convienant dead african, he gets on a plane to escape and tell the world the ""truth"" about Amin. See, even after Amin ethnically cleansed Uganda of its Asian population, the world just didn't know he was a bad man. And only Garrigan could apparently tell them.As to the film itself, the sets are all wrong. Uganda in the 1970s didn't look anything like what was shown in the film. It was like a vision of Africa set in Southern California in the 1990s.The real man in Ugandan history who was closest as a model to Garrigan was a far different person. Bob Astles was an ex british soldier who moved to Uganda and wormed his way into the local society. He was always in it for the money. His relationship with Amin was variable going from being in his confidence to being beaten in prison. Eventually Astles became directly involved with Amin's security services. When Uganda was invaded by its neighbors, Astles spent many years in prison for what he was accused of doing.A real story of Uganda or at least a more realistic story of Africa would have been far better than what showed up in this film. The film is not even really based on the book of the same name.Forest Whitaker was given all sorts of awards for his performance, but I didn't find it all that noteworthy. He is playing a one-dimensional characature of Amin. Amin was a monster, but he was also a human being. Whitaker can't really capture him as a person. People confuse acting with being a good mimic of old television news footage. They are not the same thing.The flaws in the Garrigan character are not in the acting, but in a script that is simply not credible. Garrigan's actions are irrational. In some sense, we are supposed to have sympathy for him but there is nothing really redeeming about the man. The film tries with the ending to morally redeem him. But there isn't anything redeeming or even likable about him. He used everyone around him and he got people killed through his own irresponsible actions.If you want to see the real Amin at his peak, watch the French documentary General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait (the uncut version). The truth is always stranger than fiction. And actually, a movie about all the events and absurdities surrounding that film would probably have been a better story.I would also suggest the book as an alternative the this movie. It has its own flaws, but they are forgivable where there is no way to forgive the faults of this over-rated film.",1,"forget the hype, this is a rotten film",1172707200,"03 1,

1056848,AKEJE0HB5BST0,B000NIVJF4,Mark Lee,"[1, 1]","Forrest Whitaker can do anything.  His portrayal of the sweet and gentle Nate Pope in Phenomenon is never far from my mind since I religiously watch that movie about once a year.  His General-President Idi Amin, homicidal Ugandan leader during the 1970s - is alternatingly, exhaustingly charming and terrifying, endearing and repulsive.I didn't even recognize Gillian Anderson at first.  Kerry Washington was interesting as Kay Amin, one of the President's wives.  And the questions the film raises!  To what degree should the West be held accountable for ""creating"" someone like Idi Amin?It wasn't until James McAvoy's Dr. Nicholas Carrigan was on his back having sex at the beginning of the movie that I recognized McAvoy as the faun from The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.  I don't know what that means about fauns and me, but there it is.  Fools blithely go where angels fear to tread.  Carrigan is a fool, sweet at first, then more stupid as the movie progresses, and then ""Dude, you're a dumbass"" idiotic.  When he descends into the hospital basement near the end of the movie, he's descending into his own Inferno.  Welcome home, Doctor.The scene in which Amin expertly pursuades Carrigan to remain was one of my favorites.  It served as an excellent showcase for the quality of the acting, direction, and photography.  Was Amin actually such an excellent judge of persons and such a powerful manipulator?  It's an emotional rollercoaster ride.  I was soooo uncomfortable during so much of this movie.  The lapses into ""Dazed and Confused"" cinematography were a bit much for me.  I often felt that I was being manipulated much the same way the film's Amin worked Carrigan.  And like Carrigan, who embraced Amin, the man who terrified him, I'll say that this is a fine film.  It was also terrible.

1056850,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B000NIVJF4,maskirovka,"[5, 8]","This movie gives you an up close and personal view of what one of Africa's worst dictators was like.  With a body-count ranging from a low of 80,000 to a high of over a half million, ""Big Daddy"" Amin may not compare with Hitler, Stalin, or Mao.  But he was second to none in murderous lunacy.Forrest Whittaker does a superb job playing Amin, a mixture of a buffoon, charismatic leader, and serial killer.  The way he did the role made me think of the (in)famous Internet cartoon ""Happy Tree Friends"" (where the animals start off as cuddly and appealing and end up with utterly psychotic behavior).The movie also proves something that I've suspected for a long time, that sometimes film critics barely pay attention to --or even fall asleep-- while watching films.  How else can one explain the review I read where the author complained that Amin's murderous behavior was downplayed.  That is absolutely not true.  The movie has moments of appalling violence, and it makes it very clear what Amin did to Uganda.My only criticism of the film is that Gillian Anderson (with blond hair she's unrecognizable as ""Dana Scully"" of the X-Files) is underused by the film.  There's a hint that she and the protagonist of the story (a fictional Scottish doctor who went to Uganda on a lark and became Amin's physician by accident) will become involved, but that never happens.  Frankly, I would have rather seen that than the doctor's ill-advised affair with one of Amin's wives (who pays very, very dearly for her infidelity).But that's a minor quibble.  I think that the next time I hear about someone decrying the evils of colonialism, I'm going to bring up Amin and the horror so well documented in ""the Last King of Scotland.""",5,Heart of Darkness Redux,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,1719,"['movie', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'view', 'what', 'one', 'Africa', 'worst', 'dictators', 'was', 'body-count', 'ranging', 'low', '80,000', 'high', 'half', 'million', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Amin', 'may', 'not', 'compare', 'Hitler', 'Stalin', 'Mao', 'was', 'second', 'none', 'murderous', 'lunacy.Forrest', 'Whittaker', 'superb', 'job', 'playing', 'Amin', 'mixture', 'buffoon', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'serial', 'killer', 'way', 'did', 'role', 'made', 'think', 'famous', 'Internet', 'cartoon', 'Happy', 'Tree', 'Friends', 'where', 'animals', 'start', 'off', 'as', 'cuddly', 'appealing', 'end', 'up', 'utterly', 'psychotic', 'behavior', '.The', 'movie', 'also', 'something', ""'ve"", 'suspected', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'critics', 'barely', 'pay', 'attention', 'even', 'fall', 'asleep', 'watching', 'films', 'How', 'else', 'can', 'one', 'explain', 'review', 'read', 'where', 'author', 'complained', 'Amin', 'murderous', 'behavior', 'was', 'downplayed', 'absolutely', 'not', 'true', 'movie', 'moments', 'appalling', 'violence', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'Amin', 'did', 'Uganda.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'film', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'blond', 'hair', 'unrecognizable', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'X-Files', 'underused', 'film', 'hint', 'protagonist', 'story', 'fictional', 'Scottish', 'doctor', 'who', 'went', 'Uganda', 'lark', 'became', 'Amin', 'physician', 'accident', 'will', 'become', 'involved', 'never', 'Frankly', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'doctor', 'ill-advised', 'affair', 'one', 'Amin', 'wives', 'who', 'very', 'very', 'dearly', 'infidelity', 'minor', 'quibble', 'think', 'next', 'time', 'hear', 'someone', 'decrying', 'evils', 'colonialism', ""'m"", 'going', 'bring', 'up', 'Amin', 'horror', 'so', 'well', 'documented', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland']",N/A
1056851,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000NIVJF4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","""The Last King of Scotland"" impressed me greatly. This is a story that deserves to be told so that the world will always know the ruthlessness and brutal violence perpetrated by Idi Amin and his regime while Amin was in power in Uganda during the 1970s. Even though I had a fairly good idea of how it all would play out after the first thirty minutes or so, I remained glued to the screen by the acting and the overall story line being played out so very well. Forest Whitaker's performance as Idi Amin lacks nothing; he deserved both the Oscar and the Golden Globe awards that he won for his performance. Equally convincing and special is the fine acting work of James McAvoy as the young doctor Nicholas Garrigan. Kerry Washington turns in a stunning performance, too. The cinematography and the choreography are wonderful and the musical score enhances the movie even more.When the action starts at the beginning of the 1970s, we meet young doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who, fresh out of medical school, travels to Uganda to help the poor and needy who don't have access to doctors there. However, Nicholas is rather nave; the extreme paucity of medical care shocks him and he feels overwhelmed. Nicholas and his boss' wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson) attend a speech given by new Uganda leader Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). Although Sarah remains unconvinced that Amin will be anything different from his far less than admirable predecessors, Nicholas falls for Amin's charm and optimistically enjoys the event. Unexpectedly, on the way back from the rally Nicholas is called to help Amin who has hurt his hand in a car accident; and it isn't long before Idi Amin invites Nicholas to his presidential home in Kampala where Amin alternately insists and sweet-talks Nicholas into becoming his personal physician.Nicholas is swept up into Amin's world and for a while he enjoys the benefits of his new position and power--Amin buys him expensive suits, a Mercedes and introduces him to VIPS at social parties and government events. Amin even asks Nicholas to take his place at a meeting where he must pick a design for a new building in Kampala! Nicholas is particularly struck by one of Idi Amin's beautiful wives Kay (Kerry Washington); Nicholas is something of a womanizer and the attraction between Kay and Nicholas becomes part of the plot.It also isn't long before Nicholas begins to realize that Idi Amin might not be such a wonderful man. Nicholas eventually discovers that Amin orders hits on people who oppose him politically; and there's even one occasion in which Nicholas himself accidentally becomes a catalyst for someone being killed. Once he realizes that Idi Amin is inhumane and vicious to say the least, Nicholas wants to leave Uganda to return to his native Scotland; but Amin refuses to let Nicholas go! There is also some racial tension building as the movie progresses; Nicholas is increasingly seen as ""the white man"" even though he harbors no hate toward Ugandans.I've left out some of the plot so as not to spoil it for you; and I won't say much more about what happens during the rest of the movie in case you do not know where all this leads. Suffice it to say that there are a few interesting plot twists and you will be fascinated by the action. However, there are also a few grisly scenes especially near the end of the movie so I certainly wouldn't recommend this film for young children or anyone else who might be sensitive to this.The DVD comes with a few extras: an optional running commentary by director Kevin Macdonald; deleted scenes; a bonus entitled ""Capturing Idi Amin;"" ""Forest Whitaker `Idi Amin'"" and more!""The Last King of Scotland"" showcases spectacular performances by Forest Whitaker, Kerry Washington and James McAvoy; it's an essential film for fans of these actors.

I grew up in Africa amongst Scottish and English colonialists and was at Entebbe Airport only 2 weeks before the Israeli Entebbe raid - i think i talk from some experience - do not be taken in by this film - it certainly did'nt deserve any oscars , it was 2 tedious hours of badly scripted , low budget drama based only loosely on facts .If you want a real story of Africa that did deserve to get an oscar is ""Blood Diamond"" - not this one .

I can only say two things about the movie.One, I enjoyed quite a bit about it.  I found myself interested nearly the entire movie through and never was I disinterested with any of the characters.Two, at a certain point the movie becomes disjointed and difficult to understand.  That's when I started to dislike the movie - because I couldn't understand what had just happened.  One moment Amin was a beloved leader, revered by the people, looked up to and hearalded, the next he's off killing people as traitors.  There is no real transition to this event; it's never 100% clear exactly what his motives are.  It's like he just snapped one day and became paranoid after something happens (can't say exactly...would spoil it), but that's not realistic at all.

Not exciting enough, so he spins again and it lands on Uganda. And so Nicholas jumps on a plane, having no idea whatsoever that the country is in turmoil socially and politically and goes to Uganda: land of Idi Amin (a massive, magnificent Forest Whitaker).For most of ""The Last King of Scotland,"" Nicholas lucks into much of what happens to him. What Nicholas doesn't realize, at first at least, is that he is not in control of the events of his life....the events are in control of him.Much sooner than later, Nicholas is schmoozed by Amin himself to become Amin's personal doctor: a position that allows him entry into the personal as well as the political life of Uganda and of its leader. This of course proves to be a double edged sword and it is from the friction of this blade slicing through all strata's of Ugandan and Amin's life  from which the drama of this film is derived: privilege always comes with a price, political privilege  comes with a bill that inevitably finds us lacking the emotional currency to settle.The big deal here is without a doubt Forest Whitaker's Idi Amin.

If there has ever been a cinematic performance that can truly be said to burst out of the screen, it's Whitaker's. His Amin is intensely alive, unpredictable, and terrifying; staring at the other characters with his unreadable, strabismatic gaze, you never know whether he's going to hug or kill them (there's a 50-50 chance between the two). Therefore, it's a surprise when seeing the film for the first time that Amin is not the lead character. It's Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), a young Scottish doctor who's an amalgam of several Europeans unlucky enough to have been in Uganda in the 1970s. Garrigan, who comes to Uganda on a lark, is fun-loving, well-meaning, vaguely idealistic but with a wobbly moral compass. A chance meeting with Amin leaves Garrigan intoxicated with Amin's powerful charisma and charm; Amin, for his part, is convinced that Garrigan is the miracle-working adviser he's been seeking. Thus begins a toxic relationship in which Garrigan, first naively and then willfully, blinds himself to the obvious warning signs of Amin's true nature. By the time Garrigan finally wakes to Amin's insanity and the hideous carnage of Amin's rule, he finds he has no friends; all those opposed to Amin see Garrigan as Amin's ""white monkey,"" as a British diplomat sneeringly tells Garrigan. Eventually, even Amin passes moral judgment (as well as judgment of another kind) on Garrigan: ""Did you ever do anything in your life that is good?"" the bloody butcher asks the well-meaning but silly doctor. And that is a judgment, Macdonald implies, that could have been passed on far too many of us in that situation. McAvoy is excellent as Garrigan, but the character's behavior is so stupid at times that you just want to slap him. When Whitaker is on screen, the movie really comes to life. And we, like Garrigan, are seduced.",4,The high price of seduction.,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,1964,"['Kevin', 'Macdonald', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'won', 'renown', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'justly', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'ever', 'been', 'cinematic', 'performance', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'said', 'burst', 'screen', 'Whitaker', 'Amin', 'intensely', 'alive', 'unpredictable', 'terrifying', 'staring', 'other', 'characters', 'unreadable', 'strabismatic', 'gaze', 'never', 'know', 'going', 'hug', 'kill', '50-50', 'chance', 'two', 'Therefore', 'surprise', 'when', 'seeing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'Amin', 'not', 'lead', 'character', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'young', 'Scottish', 'doctor', 'who', 'amalgam', 'several', 'Europeans', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'Uganda', '1970s', 'Garrigan', 'who', 'Uganda', 'lark', 'fun-loving', 'well-meaning', 'vaguely', 'idealistic', 'wobbly', 'moral', 'compass', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Amin', 'Garrigan', 'intoxicated', 'Amin', 'powerful', 'charisma', 'charm', 'Amin', 'part', 'convinced', 'Garrigan', 'miracle-working', 'adviser', 'been', 'seeking', 'Thus', 'toxic', 'relationship', 'Garrigan', 'first', 'naively', 'then', 'willfully', 'obvious', 'warning', 'signs', 'Amin', 'true', 'nature', 'time', 'Garrigan', 'finally', 'Amin', 'insanity', 'hideous', 'carnage', 'Amin', 'rule', 'friends', 'opposed', 'Amin', 'see', 'Garrigan', 'Amin', 'white', 'monkey', 'British', 'diplomat', 'sneeringly', 'Garrigan', 'Eventually', 'even', 'Amin', 'moral', 'judgment', 'as', 'well', 'judgment', 'kind', 'Garrigan', 'Did', 'ever', 'do', 'anything', 'life', 'good', 'bloody', 'butcher', 'well-meaning', 'silly', 'doctor', 'judgment', 'Macdonald', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'passed', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'situation', 'McAvoy', 'excellent', 'Garrigan', 'character', 'behavior', 'so', 'stupid', 'times', 'just', 'want', 'slap', 'When', 'Whitaker', 'screen', 'movie', 'really', 'life', 'Garrigan', 'are', 'seduced']",N/A
1056863,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000NIVJF4,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","""The Last King of Scotland"" is based on the novel of the same name by Giles Foden, set in Uganda in the1970s during the reign of bloodthirsty President Idi Amin. The picture it paints of Idi Amin attempts to be accurate in tone and deed. But Foden places a fictional Scotsman who becomes an advisor to Amin into the historical context, turning the story into a thriller and giving us an insider's eyes through which to see Amin. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is feeling restless in his father's medical practice in Scotland. Eager for adventure and new challenges, he goes to Uganda to assist at a small hospital in the jungle. Nicholas' bold response to a crisis impresses the nation's President, Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), who recently took power in a military coup with Britain's blessings. Amin asks Nicholas to become his personal physician and help create a new Health Service for the country. Nicholas' vanity gets the best of him, and he finds himself beholden to Amin's whims and complicitous in his abuse.""The Last King of Scotland"", named for Idi Amin's love of all things Scottish and his support for Scottish nationalism, is accurate in the big picture of what went on in Uganda under Amin, while it changes details and rearranges events to serve Nicholas' story. The film's greatest attempt to inform is in the depiction of the charismatic, capricious Idi Amin. Forest Whitaker won an Oscar for his portrayal of this larger-than-life personality who was as charming and perceptive as he was paranoid and immoral. James McAvoy deserves a lot of credit as well for his vain, naive, and ultimately desperate turn as Nicholas. Nicholas represents Britain's view of Amin as it changed from hope to denial to horror over the course of his presidency. ""The Last King of Scotland"" is a fantastic marriage of history and thriller with a dose of politics as well. Nicholas' actions propel us through the story without missing a beat. The atmosphere is superb. Director Kevin Macdonald's first fiction film is successful in every way.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 2 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a theatrical trailer (2 min), 3 featurettes, and an audio commentary. ""Capturing Idi Amin"" (29 min) is a BBC short documentary about the real Idi Amin, how Ugandans perceived him,  facts vs fiction in the film, and the challenges in placing a fictional story in a historical context. ""Forest Whittaker - Idi Amin"" (6 min) interviews actors Whitaker and McAvoy about the character of Amin. ""Fox Movie Channel Presents: Casting Session"" (8 min) interviews the film's director, producer, and casting director Jina Jay about how they cast Forest Whitaker, who talks about preparing for the role. There is a good audio commentary by director Kevin Macdonald. He talks a lot about locations and people in Uganda who were involved with the film, provides some additional information about Amin, and addresses character development.

To get away from his idiot dad, Nicholas Garrigan (Played by James McAvoy), goes to the last place on earth anyone would want to be other then the USSR, Uganda!  When he gets there he frolicks with the female natives, makes some new friends like Dr. Merrit and his wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson).  Before long, Nicholas falls hard for the Sarah, but she rejects him kindly.Then they have a chance incounter with Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), Nicholas helps bandge his hand up, and he takes his gun and shoots a wounded cow without his permission.  Idi is impressed, and then realizes that Nicholas isn't acutally British but Scottish.  What a suprise they share something in common like most friends do, Uganda and Scotland were or is under British occupation.After Idi becomes leader of all Uganda, he invites Nicholas into his home, as it turns out he's obsesssed with Scotland as a country.  Nicholas and Idi become fast friends, and while Idi is charming, funny and charismatic, alas like most villians he too had his share of flaws.The British try to warn Nicholas that Idi isn't who he thinks he is and try to tell him that if he gets in his way, he could die.  But Nicholas isn't worried to much, he has nice stuff that Idi gives to him.  But then things turn sour when Nicholas takes notice of one of Idi's wives.  Only question is, will Nicholas as stupid and naive as he is get out of Uganda alive?  I'm not telling just find out for yourselves!Here is what I think of the movie as a whole.A. Music- Fantastic music by the African choirs and chants it makes you think you're in Africa yourself.B. Scenery- Just beautiful, makes me want to go to Uganda itself.C. Plot- Brillient.D. Acting- Brillient, Forest Whitaker plays Idi so authintically that you won't even know it's him!  And anyone who says that Forset doesn't or didn't deserve that Oscar, they're wrong.  He won that Oscar far and square!

Weems ""emperor_weems""","[4, 5]","This film probably would have otherwise gotten a 3 stars from me, but all due respect goes to Forest Whitaker for an amazing performance, so he alone bumps this up to 4 stars for me.I saw this movie expecting that I would be at least a little let down, since I had read the Foden novel and wasn't entirely impressed by the book.  In the novel, I found Dr. Garrigan a little too plodding, though I did appreciate the aspect the bookwas working on of a man who is trying to avoid controversy nevertheless wooed into the thick of controversy through both his neutrality and through the powerful personality and charm of Idi Amin.But the movie took a completely unfortunate tack.  Instead of being mildly weathered and maybe a little pessimistic about the world, Doctor Garrigan is instead young and naive and ambitious and idealistic, and these are what Amin uses to bring Garrigan into his fold.  While the book did drag a bit for its resistance to melodrama (except, maybe, towards the end), the movie makes the doctor quite the young piece of bravado by having him shooting cattle in the head and sleeping with the President's wife.  I found this stupidity (no other word for it) just plain over the top, which is tough to say when dealing with the story of Idi Amin's tyranny, but nonetheless the case.It is unfortunate because it seems that some movie execs got together and decided that Foden's Garrigan would not be an interesting leading man for the movie, so he went into rewrite.  The shame with this decision is that it is a total revision of the book to its very essence--rather than Amin being a threat for his ability to exploit anything but rabid dissention, Garrigan is instead a bumbling Scot who seems to lack too much common sense to avoid Amin at all.  Most of the threat is removed, and so Amin is down to being a mad killer rather than a charismatic mad killer.  Also, the removal of some wonderful Amin monlogues from the book, where he meanders wonderfully and shows the depth of his delusions, were a gaping hole here.Whitaker clearly deserved all accolades he received for his performance, but the movie as a whole left me rather wanting.",4,a bonus star for Whitaker,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,2161,"['film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'gotten', '3', 'stars', 'due', 'respect', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'amazing', 'performance', 'alone', 'up', '4', 'stars', 'me.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'expecting', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'had', 'read', 'Foden', 'novel', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'impressed', 'book', 'novel', 'found', 'Dr.', 'Garrigan', 'little', 'too', 'plodding', 'did', 'appreciate', 'aspect', 'bookwas', 'working', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'avoid', 'controversy', 'nevertheless', 'wooed', 'thick', 'controversy', 'neutrality', 'powerful', 'personality', 'charm', 'Idi', 'Amin.But', 'movie', 'took', 'completely', 'unfortunate', 'tack', 'Instead', 'being', 'mildly', 'weathered', 'maybe', 'little', 'pessimistic', 'world', 'Doctor', 'Garrigan', 'instead', 'young', 'naive', 'ambitious', 'idealistic', 'are', 'what', 'Amin', 'bring', 'Garrigan', 'fold', 'book', 'did', 'drag', 'bit', 'resistance', 'melodrama', 'maybe', 'end', 'movie', 'doctor', 'quite', 'young', 'piece', 'bravado', 'having', 'shooting', 'cattle', 'head', 'sleeping', 'President', 'wife', 'found', 'stupidity', 'other', 'word', 'just', 'plain', 'top', 'tough', 'say', 'when', 'dealing', 'story', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'tyranny', 'nonetheless', 'case.It', 'unfortunate', 'movie', 'execs', 'got', 'together', 'decided', 'Foden', 'Garrigan', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'interesting', 'leading', 'man', 'movie', 'went', 'rewrite', 'shame', 'decision', 'total', 'revision', 'book', 'very', 'essence', 'rather', 'Amin', 'being', 'threat', 'ability', 'exploit', 'anything', 'rabid', 'dissention', 'Garrigan', 'instead', 'bumbling', 'Scot', 'who', 'lack', 'too', 'much', 'common', 'sense', 'avoid', 'Amin', 'Most', 'threat', 'removed', 'so', 'Amin', 'down', 'being', 'mad', 'killer', 'rather', 'charismatic', 'mad', 'killer', 'Also', 'removal', 'wonderful', 'Amin', 'monlogues', 'book', 'where', 'wonderfully', 'depth', 'delusions', 'were', 'gaping', 'hole', 'here.Whitaker', 'clearly', 'deserved', 'accolades', 'received', 'performance', 'movie', 'whole', 'left', 'rather', 'wanting']",N/A

Nicholas Garrigan is a fictional character based loosely on Bob Astles(who in my opinion is boring compared to Nicholas Garrigan).

I remember the stories about Idi Amin in the papers and on the evening news back in the late 70s and he terrified me, even though he was thousands of miles away from where I was at the time (in Nigeria). He terrified me because he had such a strong resemblance to my father and he seemed to be ruling Uganda with the same ruthless tyranny with which my father ruled his household. There were never any heads in the fridge in our house back then but in my teenage imagination, anything was possible. Whitaker inhabits the spirit of Amin in a way I haven't seen since Jamie Foxx's (also Oscar-winning) impersonation of Ray Charles. Idi Amin was a madman and Whitaker looks every inch the madman here. I knew where the story was going, to a large extent I knew how it was going to end, but this made it no less terrifying. And no less mesmerising. I barely moved a muscle from beginning to end.It was also very interesting for me because Forest Whitaker is currently on our TV screens here in the UK, playing the role of Curtis Ames in ""ER"" (yes, we're several months behind) and while I don't know how THAT story is going to end - I've been tempted to find out on NBC's website but I've so far resisted - his sinister performance as he seems to be stalking Luka, Abby and Joe, is similarly terrifying.And it wasn't so long ago that he was Lt Jon Kavanaugh, Det. Vic Mackey's Internal Affairs nemesis on the groundbreaking cop drama ""The Shield"". He was pretty scary in that too.But he's not always scary. I remember him in movies like ""Bird"", ""Phone Booth"" and ""Waiting to Exhale"" and I felt he played those roles with sympathy and humanity. He can be cuddly. He's certainly come a long way since 1992's ""The Crying Game"", which was where I first saw him. The fact that he's been able to convince so well in all these varied roles proves what a great actor he is and I think no one deserved the 'Best Actor' Oscar this year more than he did. This movie is all about Forest Whitaker. I think James McAvoy, Kerry Washington, Simon McBurney and Gillian Anderson all gave very good performances too but this is essentially Whitaker's movie and he's really the only one I wanted to talk about in this review. He gives the performance of a lifetime. This is a must-see and definitely one for the DVD collection.PS. A Ugandan friend of mine who was there during the Idi Amin days, though a teenager himself, says he felt like he was watching a documentary when he saw the movie. He thinks it is a very accurate portrayal of that very complex period of Ugandan history.

Randall,"[5, 5]","A slightly fictionalized story set against the backdrop of one of the more horrific dictatorships in history, ""The Last King of Scotland"" proves to be a cinematic gem with one of the most outstanding performances in film history.Forest Whitaker portrays the notorious Ugandan dictator during his rule in the 1970's.  To provide a reference angle for that time, the composite character of Nicholas Garrigan (played by Jim McEvoy) is created.  Loosely based on several individuals from that time, he is reckless, bored young doctor who travels to Uganda in search of adventure and ends up becoming Idi Amin's personal physician where he is charmed, intoxicated, and eventually terrified by Amin's power.  He bears witness Amin's purges of his enemies (real and imagined), his paranoid expulsion of Asian business from the country, and his involvement the Palestinian terrorists who hijacked an Air France passenger jet.  While there is certain dramatic license taken with actual events, this film does a masterful job at portraying this monstrous individual.Whitaker gave his all to perform the role of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.  He learned Swahili and was able to adopt his West African accent.  In addition, he learned all the mannerisms and personality traits of Amin.  His transformation was so completely that, for months after filming was completed on this film, Whitaker would still slip into his Idi Amin persona.  The result was almost indescribable in its excellence.  Whitaker may have been the most deserving winner of the Best Actor Oscar in history.""The Last King of Scotland"" derives its title from Amin's obsession with Scotland.  He even offered to be Scotland's King (hence the title), but the offer was understandably rejected.  This movie is not a film for the faint of heart.  It is unflinching in its portrayals of Amin's atrocities.  But, for those who do see it, the power of this portrayal will stay with you long after you leave the theater.",5,Amazing Powerful film.

A fascinating premise? Yes, but, sadly, not in this case. The story is just ridiculous. I wont ruin it for you by describing how utterly unlikely any of this could happen because I want you to watch the film. Why? Beause of Forest Whitaker, that's why. His performance is spell binding. His playful menace is terrifying and I was gripped by his performance every second he was on the screen. If he had been on the screen for every second, I would have given this film 5 stars. Alas, he is not.James McAvoy is a good enough actor, but he has to battle with a story line that makes your eyes roll with incredulity. The script also makes him so unsympathetic that even in his worse moments - and there are some pretty bad moments for him - it is impossible to root for him, no matter how hard you try.At the end of the film, we are reminded of the brilliant Entebbe raid by Israeli forces. (Hope I am not giving too much away here?) Now that should have been the subject matter of this film. This would have given the film credibility and given Forest more time on screen. This dumb stupid story is a wasted opportunity. Watch it for Forest.A few scenes that jar: At a party, the doctor is introduced to British diplomats, one of whom says that it is nice to have another Englishman here. The doctor replies churlishly and indignantly that he is Scots. Of course he is! No Englishman would have mistaken the very obviously Scottish accented doctor for an Englishman. An example of extreme stupidity in the script. In another scene, the doctor goes to one of Amin's parties and goes off with one of Amin's wives to her bedroom. It beggars belief that anyone would do that knowing how thuggish and murderous Amin is and what the consequences would be.

Forest Whitaker is outstanding as the main character.  He's been known as a method actor who would BE Idi Amin himself throughout the duration of filming & he would interview Idi's family members to get his essence as right as possible.  Gilian Anderson's convincing as an English missionary doctor's lonely wife, James McAvoy who played the half man, half horse beast in Narnia is excellent in his portrayal of Idi's personal physician & so does Kerry Washington, who plays Idi's third wife. The movie has an authentic feel about it considering that it's filmed at Uganda. We must ask ourselves the purpose of having this film made.  Is it to raise awareness of the plight of Ugandans or is it simply to make a movie about a madman?  If the purpose is for the Ugandas, why is it that Uganda is still under the rule of a dictator to these days, who has reigned for the past 20 years?

M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso""","[0, 0]","Last King of Scotland is an interwoven fictional account of the complex relationship between Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish physician, and Idi Amin, the unstable Ugandan dictator.  James MacAvoy does a stand-up job as Garrigan, just out of medical school and seeking escape from the boring, genteel existence he'd face as a National Health physician in his homeland.Garrigan has a chance encounter with Amin, is seduced by the man's magnetism and the luxuries he can provide, and becomes Idi's personal physician.  The film covers the next several years as Garrigan slowly realizes the Faustian bargain he has made with an increasingly erratic and paranoid Amin, and then tries to escape Uganda.Forest Whitaker totally steals the film as Amin.  He manages to not only look the role, but to speak Amin's tribal language and give the impression that he was just a good ESL student.

This representation isaccurate and outstanding, with the exception of the more privatemoments, suggesting that Idi Amin was sentimental, artistic in hisappreciation and knew how to enjoy himself. This is pureconjecture, as the real Idi Amin proved to be anyone else than onekeen on pleasures and subtle with opponents.James McAvoy, as Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, gives an honest effort inthis character, yet  comes across much too adolescent-like in hisdemeanor, such as the hippy-length unkept hair, disorganized, andsexually promiscuous -  all conduct that is anything but that of alicensed, mature, medical professional -  thereby not only takingaway from the credibility of the character, but also, of theBritish, as he's the only European in Idi Amin's tight knit socialcircle. It also seems unsound to suggest that a MD would havespontaneous, unprotected relations with girls on a public  bus,when many parts of Africa have AIDS and hepatitis issues.In the extras of the DVD's, we learn that the MD is a fictionalcharacter, yet this movie attempts to be historically accurate,artistic liberty having been taken to weave an auto-biographicaltale into this work, upclose to the Idi Admin. That is to say, thework is outstanding in showing the misconduct of Idi Amin, yet thefictional aspects may confuse viewers, going forward.Simon McBurney mixes a comical yet sinister personality as acombination of Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickenson  and the Sex Pistol'sJohnny Rotten.A correct lesson, is that prejudice is eliminated by minglingdifferent groups and nations, having them work together for acommon purpose, as IDI AMIN did while in a Scottish Regiment,having instilled into him a deep respect and friendship withfellow soldiers over a period of time, while their cook, janitor,and army soldier.Accurately portrayed, as well, are guerilla factions ready toerupt and disturb the peace in highly populated areas, disagreeingwith the ones in power, as well as the influence of 10 DowningStreet in all affairs.The film is impressive in describing, realistically, theundercurrents of power, rivals, conspirators, guerillas, tanks,Ak-47 in the streets,  the primitive nature of the country-side,the importance of the merchant classes, the economy, the massmedia, etc. It also shows that IDI AMIN appreciated being advisedon matters, so long as the advice matched his own thoughts andopinions, the yes men being appreciated.The tension of the climax, surrounding the Entebbe airlineincident,  is effective nonetheless yet contrived.",5,"Brave, accurate portrayal of a developing country and leader",1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,3089,"['Last', 'King', 'Scotland', '2006', 'work', 'sincerebelief', 'human', 'rights', 'special', 'courage', 'authors', 'itwas', 'released', 'only', 'relatively', 'short', 'time', 'underlyingevents.The', 'filming', 'wide-screen', 'standard', 'European', 'quality', 'professionally', 'made', 'aspects', 'reproach', 'excess', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'moments', 'thefolklorish', 'portraying', 'populations', 'there', 'who', 'erupt', 'insong', 'dance', 'spontaneously.Forest', 'Whitaker', 'playing', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'impeccable', 'shines', 'taking', 'persona', 'leader', 'representation', 'isaccurate', 'outstanding', 'exception', 'more', 'privatemoments', 'suggesting', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'was', 'sentimental', 'artistic', 'hisappreciation', 'knew', 'how', 'enjoy', 'pureconjecture', 'real', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'proved', 'be', 'anyone', 'else', 'onekeen', 'pleasures', 'subtle', 'opponents.James', 'McAvoy', 'Dr.', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'honest', 'effort', 'inthis', 'character', 'yet', 'much', 'too', 'adolescent-like', 'hisdemeanor', 'such', 'hippy-length', 'unkept', 'hair', 'disorganized', 'andsexually', 'promiscuous', 'conduct', 'anything', 'alicensed', 'mature', 'medical', 'professional', 'thereby', 'not', 'only', 'takingaway', 'credibility', 'character', 'also', 'theBritish', 'only', 'European', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'tight', 'knit', 'socialcircle', 'also', 'unsound', 'suggest', 'MD', 'would', 'havespontaneous', 'unprotected', 'relations', 'girls', 'public', 'bus', 'when', 'many', 'parts', 'Africa', 'have', 'AIDS', 'hepatitis', 'issues.In', 'extras', 'DVD', 'learn', 'MD', 'fictionalcharacter', 'yet', 'movie', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'artistic', 'liberty', 'having', 'been', 'taken', 'weave', 'auto-biographicaltale', 'work', 'upclose', 'Idi', 'Admin', 'say', 'thework', 'outstanding', 'showing', 'misconduct', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'yet', 'thefictional', 'aspects', 'may', 'confuse', 'viewers', 'going', 'forward.Simon', 'McBurney', 'mixes', 'comical', 'yet', 'sinister', 'personality', 'acombination', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'Bruce', 'Dickenson', 'Sex', ""Pistol'sJohnny"", 'Rotten.A', 'correct', 'lesson', 'prejudice', 'eliminated', 'minglingdifferent', 'groups', 'nations', 'having', 'work', 'together', 'acommon', 'purpose', 'IDI', 'AMIN', 'did', 'Scottish', 'Regiment', 'having', 'instilled', 'deep', 'respect', 'friendship', 'withfellow', 'soldiers', 'period', 'time', 'cook', 'janitor', 'army', 'soldier.Accurately', 'portrayed', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'guerilla', 'factions', 'ready', 'toerupt', 'disturb', 'peace', 'highly', 'populated', 'areas', 'ones', 'power', 'as', 'well', 'influence', '10', 'DowningStreet', 'affairs.The', 'film', 'impressive', 'describing', 'realistically', 'theundercurrents', 'power', 'rivals', 'conspirators', 'guerillas', 'tanks', 'Ak-47', 'streets', 'primitive', 'nature', 'country-side', 'importance', 'merchant', 'classes', 'economy', 'massmedia', 'etc', 'also', 'IDI', 'AMIN', 'appreciated', 'being', 'advisedon', 'matters', 'so', 'long', 'advice', 'matched', 'own', 'thoughts', 'andopinions', 'yes', 'men', 'being', 'appreciated.The', 'tension', 'climax', 'surrounding', 'Entebbe', 'airlineincident', 'effective', 'nonetheless', 'yet', 'contrived']",N/A

I thought it was going to be a biopick of Idi Amin and that didn't interest me.  However, I got it free at the library and, the night before the DVD was due, I put it in the machine to see if I might be interested.The fact that the protagonist was really the young Scottish dr. made it more interesting to me than I had expected.  When I watched it, I assumed that it he was a real character.  Then, by reading the reviews here I discovered he wasn't, which puts the whole film in a different place in my head.  How much was real and how much wasn't??  It could worry me a little but I chose to let it go and just enjoy it.Actually the use of the dr. is a smart device that works well and it certainly makes for an interesting story.  James McAvoy is a bit annoying, but that is good, too, given the nature of the fellow he's portraying.  At first I thought he was going to be a real hero and I kept wondering when he was going to wise up and get out of there. A lot about him was ""wrong"" --he looked way too young and was just too scrawny and silly looking to have so many women falling for him.  And what was he, really, a good decent guy who wanted to help out, or a spoiled punk who was just out for an adventure???  I thought the character was really very well written and acted by showing the complexity of the guy.  I ended up by seeing him as totally believable.Forrest Whittaker was superb and surely deserved the Oscar. He portrayed the full range of this distressing man's personality with brilliance as everyone here has remarked.

It seamlessly portrays Amin's rise to power and his decline as his authoritarian regime swallows all around him, including the closest government advisors and even his family members.

As an actor that has portrayed characters of quiet dignity in the past, Whitaker pulls out all the stops and is deserving of all the accolades heaped upon him for his performance.Besides Whitaker's bravura acting, the film boasts fine work from fellow cast mates James McAvoy as Amin's idealistic yet naive personal physician, Kerry Washington as the dictator's third wife, Simon McBurney as an Englishman that truly understands the dictator's true nature, and David Oyelowo as an Ugandan doctor with hopes for his country despite the totalitarian nature of its leader.

James McAvoy is really the lead, and it's his observations that create the center of this fine film. Forrest Whitaker justifiably won many awards for his powerful, insightful portrayal, though he really wasn't the lead character. Known for generally sweet-natured performances, Mr. Whitaker has a repertoire that is most respected. This display of total control and command of the character is frightening and complete, a tour de force. Anyone remember his magnificent performance as Charlie Parker in Eastwood's ""Bird""? Though he wasn't the main character, this man created memorable moments (not unlike other Oscar winners with limited screen time, like Anthony Hopkins in ""Lambs"" or Geoffrey Rush in ""Shine"").  James McAvoy was given a bad rap by many, but I thought he was terrific. Kerry Washington, too was excellent, and te direction & editing were to the utmost power of the simple story being told.DVD extras are insightful, and Mr. Whitaker's humble approach to the frighteningly powerful role is well examined.

1056892,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000NIVJF4,RMurray847,"[2, 2]","LAST KING OF SCOTLAND suffers from some of the same problems as HOTEL RWANDA.  It is timid in its exploration of the atrocities committed by Idi Amin.  While I  have no interest in seeing horrible things happen to humans just for the sake of entertainment (I can watch HOSTEL if that's what interests me), I also feel that a true understanding of what Amin inflicted on his country is missing from this film.  The way  he's presented, he mostly seems like a charismatic but unstable leader, who become increasingly paranoid and blithely knocked off his inner-circle of advisors left and right.  He did do these things...but he inflicted so much more agony too.  If a viewer came to Idi Amin for the first time through this movie, they would wonder what much of the fuss is about.  It needs to show the SCALE of the horrors this man inflicted...just like HOTEL RWANDA needed to show us the true face of those atrocities.A movie like SCHINDLER'S LIST made the holocaust a personal story, but also showed the horrors on a broad scale.  LAST KING OF SCOTLAND could have done the same. (Although no doubt not as powerfully...that was Spielberg's finest effort, after all).But this disappointment aside, there is much to admire about this excellent film, starting WITH the charismatic performance by Forest Whitaker.  Whitaker is never less than compelling to watch.  We see many facets of Amin...from bold leader, to national hero, to simpering child, to loving father, to paranoid lunatic, to delusional monster.  Whitaker makes the man likeable for much of the film...which is important, because he is viewed mostly through the eyes of a young, white British doctor (James McAvoy) who is enticed to join Amin's inner circle.  If Whitaker played him as just a nut-case, why would McAvoy ever allow himself to become part of the ""team?""  Whitaker has always been a very good actor, with a wide range.  But his Amin is the shining high point of his career thus far.  He digs into this character with great intensity...I doubt the sweat that's always beading on his face was created by the makeup team.  He looks like a guy always on the brink of exploding...whether in raucous laughter or frightening rage.The script hints at the horrible things Amin is up to...but Amin himself never references them.  He hides the truth from McAvoy...and thus from us.  We feel as though the good doctor is anxious to get away from Amin only because he fears for his own life...not because he's seen what is happening to the country of Uganda.  While Whitaker more than delivers on his responsibilities to present Amin as the dangerous tyrant he was...the script allows few opportunities to show what Amin DID.So McAvoy is sometimes left looking more mildly concerned than terrified and outraged.  Later in the film, he suffers a personal tragedy and this energizes him...but for a lot of the movie, I was wondering how in the world he was so oblivious.  McAvoy (ATONEMENT) is a charming and capable actor...but he comes across as a bit of a lightweight in comparison to Whitaker's booming presence.  But the way  his character was developed (and the doctor IS the lead role), there probably wouldn't be many actors who could have made the part as interesting as Amin.  (Although here's another problem with the script:  McAvoy's character is fictional, so part of me felt that the filmmakers were wary of showing the story through any point of view other than that of a white person.  So often the plight of minorities is depicted through the eyes of the white majority...MISSISSIPPI BURNING is the first example that pops to mind, but there are lots of others.)The film also offers a brief but lovely performance from Gillian Anderson, hair dyed blonde and skin deeply bronzed.  At first, I just enjoyed seeing how different she looked from Dana Scully...but ultimately I was captured by her quiet charisma.  Sadly, she is only in the first third or so of the film.The film also has beautiful cinematography.  The film stock was highly saturated, making the colors richer than real life.  This has the effect of conveying not only the beauty of the land, but the intense heat.Despite my problems with the way the script decided to tell this story, and with its assumption that we all remember the famous ""Raid on Entebbe"" that brought Amin to the world's attention...I still recommend the film highly.  Whitaker certainly gave a performance worthy of Oscar consideration, and the story we do get is fascinating.  I'm frustrated it wasn't more...but I very much was engaged in what we were given.This is the kind of film that will have folks hitting the internet for more information of Idi Amin.

1056893,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B000NIVJF4,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[1, 1]","Heroes and Demons and those who are bothThe movie is about the interplay of passions: sex, power, mostly with a big dose of racism and cultural chavinism.The main character is a naive, young, Scottish doctor, who is both passionate and shallow at the same time.The is seduced by both the beauty of the land, the passion of it's women, but mostly by Idi Amin and the closeness to power that relationship brings.There are lots of movies about either heroes and demons, but few about the conflicts in a person who is both at the same time.The is naive and shallow, he chooses where to go after medical school by randomly picking a place on the globe (although Canada was the first pick, Uganda second). He is passionate, the movie is an exception to our rule of thumb that if a movie has a sex scene in the first 5 minutes then it sinks, having picked up a quickie on the bus to the clinic where he will work. But the movie shows his sexually energy as opposed to the sexuality of the demonic, theirs is cruel and is more power and control over people and their lives (through the demons killing them), lust for power. Where his is both a lust for living and a passion for pretty attractive and dangerous women. It shows his attraction to the dangerous, this heightened sense of lust by walking on the edge of forbidden relationships, the same thing that happens in his relationship with Amin.It is this relationship that occupies most of the movies attention. How he is seduced by the power and charisma of the man, with a generous heaping of access to pretty things and pretty women, but he goes for the forbidden fruit of a relationship with Amin's 3rd wife, which results in her pregnancy and her cruel death at the hands of Amin's demons. There are real heroes in the movie, the doctor in the hospital who eventually gives his life for our main characters, who utters the line: ""they will listen to you, for you are white"", and who dies with the words ""my wife"" on his lips. And the head of the health services who really cares for the people of Uganda in opposition to Amin and his demons who care about power and fulfilling their lusts for it.But it is this ambivalent relationship of the doctor to power that is most interesting, for at the end he is a hero, having found his voice in opposition to cruel and despotic murder. He pays the price for the lateness with his pain and blood, but the other doctor pays for it with his life. He is a kindof a hero, but too late to save either the wife or the people of Uganda from terror and demons.Where do heroes and demons come from? why do you see so many people facilitating murder and cruelty? and so few willing to risk life to say no, that this is wrong? There are lots of demons in societies such as Amin's Uganda, or Pol Pot's Cambodia, or Stalin's USSR or Mao's China or Nazi Germany. Many do start off as idealistic do-gooders, full of care and concern for ""The People"". I guess these lose their naivette and/or lives in prisons and in the killing fields. But many jump at the chance to get a piece of the action, being willing participants in the deeds of the great demons. Who could not exist without the complicity and active cooperation of many. It is as much a problem for me where they come from as where the few heroes come from.Naviette, ignorance, willfully closing one's eyes to the situation, seduction by the dark side. All to human and all to prominent in the 20thC. Why can't we have societies that encourage heroes in dark times rather than produce so many facilitating demons that make these events possible?Amin is a tortured character, but his passions and strength allow him to dominate the times and seduce not only the naive but an entire nation. Charisma, even a bit of humor, a competence with both words and deeds that draw people to himself, he is the big demon, the great orator, the evil hero of the times. His is a straightforward role, it is the doctor and his naviette that form the interesting contrast, for he really doesn't seem to have a life trajectory, but comes like a wandering comet under the influence of Amin until his passions collide with his oath and allegience to medicine and to healing. He tries to kill but betrays himself to save a human guinea pig forced to swallow his poison meant for Amin. He takes a stand but it is a mixed one, a doctor using poison. For in the end he is confused and forced into a stand by being backed up to a wall where despite his mixed motivations he is forced to take a stand.Perhaps this is the source of so many of our heroes. Mixed up people forced by circumstances to choose from a list of evils, forced to commit to their highest values by their lowest passions. Life is confusing and the movie is worth watching, it doesn't sort things out but makes the choices a bit more obvious and the difference between heroes and demons a bit more real.",5,about demons and heroes and those who are both,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,4885,"['Heroes', 'Demons', 'who', 'are', 'bothThe', 'movie', 'interplay', 'passions', 'sex', 'power', 'mostly', 'big', 'dose', 'racism', 'cultural', 'chavinism.The', 'main', 'character', 'naive', 'young', 'Scottish', 'doctor', 'who', 'passionate', 'shallow', 'same', 'time.The', 'seduced', 'beauty', 'land', 'passion', 'women', 'mostly', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'closeness', 'power', 'relationship', 'are', 'lots', 'movies', 'heroes', 'demons', 'few', 'conflicts', 'person', 'who', 'same', 'time.The', 'naive', 'shallow', 'where', 'go', 'medical', 'school', 'randomly', 'picking', 'place', 'globe', 'Canada', 'was', 'first', 'pick', 'Uganda', 'second', 'passionate', 'movie', 'exception', 'rule', 'thumb', 'movie', 'sex', 'scene', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'then', 'having', 'picked', 'up', 'quickie', 'bus', 'clinic', 'where', 'will', 'work', 'movie', 'sexually', 'energy', 'opposed', 'sexuality', 'demonic', 'cruel', 'more', 'power', 'control', 'people', 'lives', 'demons', 'killing', 'lust', 'power', 'Where', 'lust', 'living', 'passion', 'pretty', 'attractive', 'dangerous', 'women', 'attraction', 'dangerous', 'heightened', 'sense', 'lust', 'walking', 'edge', 'forbidden', 'relationships', 'same', 'thing', 'relationship', 'Amin.It', 'relationship', 'most', 'movies', 'attention', 'How', 'seduced', 'power', 'charisma', 'man', 'generous', 'heaping', 'access', 'pretty', 'things', 'pretty', 'women', 'forbidden', 'fruit', 'relationship', 'Amin', '3rd', 'wife', 'results', 'pregnancy', 'cruel', 'death', 'hands', 'Amin', 'demons', 'are', 'real', 'heroes', 'movie', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'who', 'eventually', 'life', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'line', 'will', 'listen', 'are', 'white', 'who', 'words', 'wife', 'lips', 'head', 'health', 'services', 'who', 'really', 'people', 'Uganda', 'opposition', 'Amin', 'demons', 'who', 'care', 'power', 'fulfilling', 'lusts', 'it.But', 'ambivalent', 'relationship', 'doctor', 'power', 'most', 'interesting', 'end', 'hero', 'having', 'found', 'voice', 'opposition', 'cruel', 'despotic', 'murder', 'price', 'lateness', 'pain', 'blood', 'other', 'doctor', 'pays', 'life', 'kindof', 'hero', 'too', 'late', 'save', 'wife', 'people', 'Uganda', 'terror', 'demons.Where', 'do', 'heroes', 'demons', 'come', 'why', 'do', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'facilitating', 'murder', 'cruelty', 'so', 'few', 'willing', 'risk', 'life', 'say', 'no', 'wrong', 'are', 'lots', 'demons', 'societies', 'such', 'Amin', 'Uganda', 'Pol', 'Pot', 'Cambodia', 'Stalin', 'USSR', 'Mao', 'China', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Many', 'do', 'start', 'off', 'idealistic', 'do-gooders', 'full', 'care', 'concern', 'People', 'guess', 'lose', 'naivette', 'and/or', 'prisons', 'killing', 'fields', 'many', 'jump', 'chance', 'get', 'piece', 'action', 'being', 'willing', 'participants', 'deeds', 'great', 'demons', 'Who', 'could', 'not', 'exist', 'complicity', 'active', 'cooperation', 'many', 'as', 'much', 'problem', 'where', 'come', 'where', 'few', 'heroes', 'come', 'from.Naviette', 'ignorance', 'willfully', 'closing', 'one', 'eyes', 'situation', 'seduction', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'prominent', '20thC', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'societies', 'encourage', 'heroes', 'dark', 'times', 'rather', 'produce', 'so', 'many', 'facilitating', 'demons', 'make', 'events', 'possible', 'Amin', 'tortured', 'character', 'passions', 'strength', 'allow', 'dominate', 'times', 'seduce', 'not', 'only', 'naive', 'entire', 'nation', 'Charisma', 'even', 'bit', 'humor', 'competence', 'words', 'deeds', 'draw', 'people', 'big', 'demon', 'great', 'orator', 'evil', 'hero', 'times', 'straightforward', 'role', 'doctor', 'naviette', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'life', 'trajectory', 'wandering', 'comet', 'influence', 'Amin', 'passions', 'collide', 'oath', 'allegience', 'medicine', 'healing', 'kill', 'save', 'human', 'guinea', 'pig', 'forced', 'swallow', 'poison', 'meant', 'Amin', 'stand', 'mixed', 'one', 'doctor', 'using', 'poison', 'end', 'confused', 'forced', 'stand', 'being', 'backed', 'up', 'wall', 'where', 'mixed', 'motivations', 'forced', 'take', 'stand.Perhaps', 'source', 'so', 'many', 'heroes', 'Mixed', 'up', 'people', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'choose', 'list', 'evils', 'forced', 'commit', 'highest', 'values', 'lowest', 'passions', 'Life', 'confusing', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', ""n't"", 'sort', 'things', 'out', 'choices', 'bit', 'more', 'obvious', 'difference', 'heroes', 'demons', 'bit', 'more', 'real']",N/A
1056894,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000NIVJF4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","The Last King of Scotland (Kevin MacDonald, 2006)Idi Amin was one of those dictators who really lived the seventies--excess, lack of restraint, far more interested in having fun than in actually running his country. Unfortunately, like his contemporary Pol Pot, he also had little use for anyone who criticized him. So much so, in fact, that three hundred thousand of his critics ended up dead during his brief eight years in power. It was a weird time, it was. Not that our particular time period is any less weird, who'd have thought that the (fictional) memoirs of Amin's doctor would get made into a movie, and that Forest Whitaker would win a Best Actor Oscar for playing the demented dictator?I will admit to not yet having read Giles Foden's book, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of the adaptation, but I do know that the movie version turned out like gangbusters. Whitaker's Amin is a fascinating chap, though one has to wonder at the portrayal of the man as less a ruthless dictator than an idealist who eventually succumbs to paranoia. James McAvoy (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) plays Nicholas Garrigan, a doctor in the bush who, after a chance encounter, finds himself invited to be Amin's personal doctor, a situation he uses to escape an awkward relationship with his boss' wife (Gillian Anderson) at the village hospital. In fact, much of what we see of Garrigan defines his life in terms of running away from things; he's in Uganda in the first place because he couldn't stand the thought of going into general practice in his family's sleepy small Scotland town. Much of the non-Amin-related drama from the movie comes from Garrigan, who starts off as a devoted believer in Amin's regime, becoming disillusioned enough to find the willpower not to run away (until, of course, not running away is the difference between life and death).In every way that Garrigan comes off as mousy (or, as British agent Nigel Stone [Simon McBurney] calls him, ""Amin's White Monkey""), Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin is boisterous. Amin comes off as larger than life, a guy whose main purpose in life is to have a good time. Give him a little power, it goes to his head, and suddenly the buzz-kills start getting murdered. But it's all good, because there's still money, power, women, and everything else that comes from being the president of a mid-sized African country. And, at the heart of it all, there is Nicholas Garrigan, who goes from being Amin's doctor to being his closest advisor, a man who doesn't know about most of what's going on and is torn about calling Amin to task for the rest and defending Amin's judgment.History has portrayed Idi Amin as one-dimensional, an insane dictator whose sole purpose was to kill his countrymen. The Last King of Scotland pushes the balance back the other way a bit, I think; while it never glosses over the fact that Amin was, in fact, an insane dictator, it makes sure we understand that that may not have always been the case, and turns Amin into a complex, three-dimensional character who is endlessly fascinating. This is a good movie, this is.

James McAvoy playing the doctor also did an outstanding job but is not receiving the attention he deserves but in the end this is a two man show that really just skims the surface of the characters as well as the times.  Only the two lead characters develop any depth and all of the other actors are little more than props.  Nevertheless the film is beautiful and a pleasure to watch.  In many ways this is a morality play that shows how the young doctor-- like most young men -- longs for excitement and desires to see exotic places and do exciting things, but pays for his naivete`.  We find him in Uganda caring for the poor, which he wanted to do, but he is very quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of them, the long hours, and the lack of progress. Doing good seems to be a lot less fun than he expected and the isolation as well as the work pall. Through some very believeable happenstances he is suddenly thrust into luxury surrounding the military dictator Amin. Thus begins the doctor's transition from callow youth seeking fun and excitement into trusted confident, then into co-conspirator, and finally just another victim of the dictator's paranoia.  There are several lessons delivered by this film.  The first quite obviously is to be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.  But it also teaches you to be careful how you treat others because you may find that you need them later on.  The gratuitous insults hurled by the doctor at the British diplomats come back to haunt him in full measure.  Then we see Idi Amin who is both charming and paranoid because like Richard III when you seize power by force you can never relax or trust anyone.  So Amin sinks into paranoia and distrust and he begins to eliminate all suspected of disloyalty.  He trusts no one including the doctor and surrounds himself with thugs willing to kill and torture for him-- but this is the fate of all dictators from Tiberias to Stalin to Amin.

1056900,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000NIVJF4,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 4]","Every political dictator is really schizophrenic con artist:  A persona of intellect, charisma, paranoia and greed, trying, suddenly, to project benevolence. Many dictators fail because what lifts them to power - murder, theft, fear and ruthlessness - contradicts with the practicality needed to keep it. What a frantic, random life they lead. One eye open in bed. Two death squads open for business.Ugandan general Idi Amin's angle was to play the lovable, chummy, gun-toting teddy bear.  He was a guy who'd take his own shirt off his back. Who'd let his soldiers dine before he did. Who believed Uganda was the root of civilization, and promised to restore its greatness.He also proclaimed himself ""Lord of All Beasts on the Earth and All Fishes in the Sea"" and expelled Asians from the country because God told him.  From 1971 through 1979, as Amin ruled Uganda, he ordered the murders of possibly 500,000 political opponents. Brutal, meticulous, torturous murders.So it makes sense that ""The Last King of Scotland,"" a fictional account of Amin's reign, is a nasty piece of business.But does it need to be this ugly?The last act of the movie plays like a contemporary tour of Dante's Inferno, tinged with the twisted vibe of the 1970s, and we're led through it by a character nearly as rotten as Amin. It's a lurid experience that, frankly, takes dead aim at women. Every female character is a target for infidelity, a one-night stand, or abuse.One character is disemboweled. Another is hung by his skin. Director Kevin Macdonald has crafted an effective, tense movie of tight close-ups and jarring violence.  But he reduces the movie to the violent fantasies of misanthropes. ""The Last King of Scotland"" is pulp fiction. Even the terrific Forest Whitaker, who plays Amin, can't escape it.Screenwriters Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan tell the story from the perspective of Nicolas Garrigan (James McAvoy) a young Scottish doctor who spins a globe and lands his finger on the middle of Africa. He starts in a rural Ugandan clinic. After a chance meeting, Amin offers Garrigan the job of personal physician. Garrigan accepts and finds Amin calling him ""my closest, most trusted advisor.""Movie ads are misleading, because Garrigan is really the center of the movie, and he's no innocent. In fact, he's a punk blown in from ""Trainspotting."" Banging around Amin's palace, wolfing down steaks, attending meetings, he falls under Amin's spell until he plays a (willful) role in the murder of a colleague. He's clued in to Amin's tactics, but it doesn't stop him from  tossing Amin's pretty third wife (Kerry Washington) against that aforementioned wall.Garrigan's creepy libertarianism leads ""The Last King of Scotland"" down a more melodramatic path than it needs to be. Amin killed so many innocents,  so it's odd that Macdonald fixates on Amin's personal war against a guy who kinda deserves it.Yes, the character is meant as a symbol of white decadence in Africa, and the cost of kicking up dirt in the backyard of a civil war. But it's no mystery that Europeans, with the help of guys like Amin, raped and pillaged the whole continent, leaving it decades behind in political and economic development. Based on a recent glut of movies about Africa, Garrigan's indulgence seems more exploitative than informative.McAvoy's annoyingly Scottish performance makes Garrigan harder to like. He hits the accent hard, especially in scenes where he's asked to sneer at British diplomats. He also seems to take Whitaker's cue in adding a bunch of flourishes to his performance. Confidence is compelling, but McAvoy acts like he's been Ewan McGregor for the last 15 years.As Amin, Forest Whitaker tears into his role to create a ravenous-yet-calculated man. He's moody, and, frankly, very funny. There two or three good, full laughs in this movie, and Whitaker is able to bury and excavate his character's dual personas within a scene. Amin understands, like few people do, both wit and slapstick. If the performance seems cartoonish, it's on purpose: Amin wanted to be a mascot to his people.Sadly, the filmmakers trust Whitaker's acting so much that the story hardly explores the sociopolitical aspects of Amin's rule. Crucial decisions and events are seen from afar. The Entebbe incident,  in which Amin allowed a hijacked Israeli airplane to land in Uganda before Israeli troops staged a rescue operation,  is presented more as a cliffhanger for Garrigan than the end symbolic end of Amin's legitimate claim to power.What makes Idi Amin tick? It is  unclear. ""The Last King of Scotland"" is more content to let us laugh his comedy, and shudder, however briefly, at the thought of his brutality. It seems so unhinged, its depiction of dictatorship so exotic and foreign, that we are left with, like ""Scarface,"" ""Fight Club"" or ""Full Metal Jacket,"" a piece of art easily manipulated for prurient desires.Don't be surprised if ""Uganda!"" quietly slips into the language of pop culture over the next few years as an expression of joy, anger, or both. That's a compliment to the movie's allure. And a fierce criticism on its lack of nuance.",3,"Long on the lurid, short on the substance",1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,5123,"['political', 'dictator', 'really', 'schizophrenic', 'con', 'artist',

James McAvoy is a Scottish doctor (and a completely invented character) who is bored with his life in Scotland and wants to add spice to his life.  The good doctor hence decides to go to Uganda at a time when a charismatic military Ugandan is becoming the president.  Through chance, and while working in a mission, McAvoy encounters this president, Idi Amin (Forrest Whitaker) and becomes Amin's personal physician, therefore having full access to all aspects of Amin's life.It is no secret that Amin was a paranoid, sociopathic monster, who exterminated large numbers of his own people.  Those who are not familiar with Uganda might think that Amin indeed did have a Scottish doctor, which he did not, but Amin did make a statement in which he proclaimed himself a King of Scotland.  Having served in the British Army, Amin became convinced that he would do a better job at ruling the United Kingdom than Elizabeth II.  Amin even offered his sexual services to the Queen of England.Even though a lot of the film is anecdotal at best, it is still a fact that Whitaker and McAvoy delivered unforgettable performances (and Whitaker won a well deserved Oscar for his role) and drew attention to this part of the world which is not well known by general populace.

1056911,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B000NIVJF4,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[9, 14]","Before I begin, I want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved, including Whittaker, who indeed deserves his nomination.  It is highly entertaining, and . . . taken in the right context as a work of FICTION, it is a very good movie.  For that, I give it the two stars.However, rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere, I want instead to point out the absolute ficitional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth.  I stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, is a complete invention of fiction.  Rather, it presents this character into a real historical setting, and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real, and what they are seeing is the truth.  I have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction - but to do so in such a dishonest matter is, in a word, reprehensible.There can be no doubt that Africa, along with most Third World Countries is rife with human misery and suffering.  Hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film.  But Hollywood also has its eye toward making money.  The only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the West is to either experience it for yourself, or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary.But these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much.  At the end of the day, they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself, and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming, ""SEE, WE TOLD YOU IT WAS BAD!""The seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the DVD after sitting through the movie.  Arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of Kay Amin, Idi's second wife, whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity.  In the film, we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse (arms for legs and vice-versa).  This is the director making sure you understand that Amin is, as the Gungans say, Bom-bad!  But watching the documentary, we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth, which the sitting Minister of Health at the time himself tells us is not true.So . . . what . . . they just MAKE UP these things?  Why?  Because Hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence, that's why!  They don't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves.  Look, that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that Amin was not the likeable guy he portrayed to the media - we don't need this TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE inspired imagery to reinforce that!And this is just the tip of the iceberg.  What is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character Garrigan is himself fictional.  There was no young Scottish doctor taken under Amin's wing.  As such, Garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb Westerners understand the African world.  The producers seem to thing we won't be interested in a film about Africa unless there is a white face in it.  (Ironically, even the titular character is portrayed by an AMERICAN black actor!)The problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of Amin and his regime, but instead an exploitative thriller about a white Westerner coming to Africa for all the wrong reasons, making several horrible mistakes, and then ""redeeming"" himself, even at the cost of three other innocent lives.  Honestly, I have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of Mrs. Amin was the result of a tryst with a ficitional Scottish doctor - it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment!I really wish Hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money.  I first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman's sugary-sweet adaptation of the life of John Nash, which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that America just can't get enough of.  The sad truth is that Hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years, and viewers, who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves, buy these fake portraits hook, line, and sinker.Look, I'm certainly not suggesting Amin is being turned into a villain he wasn't.  My point is, with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man, why must Hollywood then go to such fictional lengths?  Why must Hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films?  Why can they not trust us to think for ourselves!? Can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves?I urge all who continue to watch Hollywood's puportedly ""true"" movies to do yourself the favor of ALWAYS investigating for yourself, and to NEVER assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth!",2,"It is dangerous and reckless  to sell fiction as truth, but that is precisely what LKOS

1056914,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,B000NIVJF4,Strawgold,"[1, 1]","While I'm not well versed in the factual aspect of Idi Amin's history, I was aware that he was an extremely tyrannical, brutal dictator that rose to power in the way most brutal, bloody dictators do - by force and by charisma where it is counted.  Therefore, I'll center my own review of the film strictly on it's own merit, and that of the story it tells.A young, recently graduated medical student, Nicholas Garrigan, (James McAvoy) has aspirations of  doing something, anything - with his new degree and his life than staying home to do it.  He comes up with what he thinks is a suitable plan as he reactively starts his life and career; does an eenie meenie miney in a globe spin, rejects the first spin as being too civilized and close to home, and fate deals him the prefect second spin - Uganda.  What better place to do the Work of Importance than in The Third World and ""make that discernible difference"".He interns with a dedicated physician and his wife, who is played aptly, even though in alesser role - by Gillian Anderson, the attractive white woman who figures as one of the more elusive love interests in the film - beautiful in an earthy, practical way even when her hair is messed up.  As she is taking him on the tour of the country, she tries to explain to him some of it's politics and of it's inherent dangers, one of which is the new dictator, Idi Amin.  They have a chance to see him speak (thunder) to the masses, and it is quickly evident that this man is very bright, very charismatic when it suits him and very dangerous.  The young doctor discounts all of the sage suggestions given him by his consituents, because he doesn't think any of this can really affect him - because, as a man of medicine, he is removed from it.By chance, coming back through the countryside, dodging danger and wending through military vehicles prickly with machine guns, they come upon an accident wherein a vehicle has hit a Watusi cow.  The cow will not survive it's injuries, and is dispatched in a way by our youthful doctor (out of pity) that immediately takes the eye - and the unstable psyche - of the human victim who has hurt his hand in the accident, none other than Amin himself.  The young doctor is not afraid of him, treats the hand and is immediately drawn into the nightmare of becoming the person Amin considers ""his closest advisor"" for no specific reason, but as if by magic.  The story then begins to pick up steam, focusing on the Jeckyl/Hyde personality of Amin as the web of control tightens ever suffocatingly over Nicholas, who is by then afraid to extricate himself.The ingenious character enactment of Amin performed by Forest Whitaker was, in my estimation, not only outstanding, but brilliant; he dominates the film.  In contrast, the mild mannerisms, wholesome intelligence and vanishing naivete' that ultimately is overwhelmed by fear performance given by James McAvoy is almost as good; because he nails the character.  That is precisely the way Nicholas Garrigan is supposed to be.If you're into this type of subject matter and lots of developing nations action, you will appreciate this film.",4,"""Danger Zone""",1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,3134,"[""'m"", 'not', 'well', 'versed', 'factual', 'aspect', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'history', 'was', 'aware', 'was', 'extremely', 'tyrannical', 'brutal', 'dictator', 'rose', 'power', 'way', 'most', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'dictators', 'do', 'force', 'charisma', 'where', 'counted', 'Therefore', ""'ll"", 'center', 'own', 'review', 'film', 'strictly', 'own', 'merit', 'story', 'young', 'recently', 'graduated', 'medical', 'student', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'aspirations', 'doing', 'something', 'anything', 'new', 'degree', 'life', 'staying', 'home', 'do', 'up', 'what', 'suitable', 'plan', 'reactively', 'life', 'career', 'eenie', 'meenie', 'miney', 'globe', 'spin', 'first', 'spin', 'being', 'too', 'civilized', 'close', 'home', 'fate', 'deals', 'prefect', 'second', 'spin', 'Uganda', 'What', 'better', 'place', 'do', 'Work', 'Importance', 'Third', 'World', 'make', 'discernible', 'difference', 'dedicated', 'physician', 'wife', 'who', 'played', 'aptly', 'even', 'alesser', 'role', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'attractive', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'one', 'more', 'elusive', 'love', 'interests', 'film', 'beautiful', 'earthy', 'practical', 'way', 'even', 'when', 'hair', 'messed', 'up', 'taking', 'tour', 'country', 'explain', 'politics', 'inherent', 'dangers', 'one', 'new', 'dictator', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'speak', 'thunder', 'masses', 'quickly', 'evident', 'man', 'very', 'bright', 'very', 'charismatic', 'when', 'suits', 'very', 'dangerous', 'young', 'doctor', 'discounts', 'sage', 'suggestions', 'given', 'consituents', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'really', 'affect', 'because', 'man', 'medicine', 'removed', 'it.By', 'chance', 'coming', 'back', 'countryside', 'dodging', 'danger', 'wending', 'military', 'vehicles', 'prickly', 'machine', 'guns', 'come', 'accident', 'vehicle', 'hit', 'Watusi', 'cow', 'cow', 'will', 'not', 'survive', 'injuries', 'dispatched', 'way', 'youthful', 'doctor', 'pity', 'immediately', 'eye', 'unstable', 'psyche', 'human', 'victim', 'who', 'hurt', 'hand', 'accident', 'none', 'other', 'Amin', 'young', 'doctor', 'not', 'afraid', 'hand', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'nightmare', 'becoming', 'person', 'Amin', 'closest', 'advisor', 'specific', 'reason', 'magic', 'story', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'steam', 'focusing', 'Jeckyl/Hyde', 'personality', 'Amin', 'web', 'control', 'ever', 'suffocatingly', 'Nicholas', 'who', 'then', 'afraid', 'extricate', 'himself.The', 'ingenious', 'character', 'enactment', 'Amin', 'performed', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'was', 'estimation', 'not', 'only', 'outstanding', 'brilliant', 'film', 'contrast', 'mild', 'mannerisms', 'wholesome', 'intelligence', 'vanishing', 'naivete', 'ultimately', 'overwhelmed', 'fear', 'performance', 'given', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'almost', 'good', 'character', 'precisely', 'way', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'supposed', 'be.If', ""'re"", 'type', 'subject', 'matter', 'lots', 'developing', 'nations', 'action', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film']",N/A

The Scotsman's character is fictional and ""based"" on a character from a book which also like the movie is again ""based"" on facts during Amin's tyrannical rule. The movie should not be considered 100% historically accurate. The fictitious Scotsman's character is based on the the life of Bob Astles, an Englishman who was a close associate of Idi Amin and who after Amin's ousting fled to Kenya. He was later apprehended and was sentenced for crimes (theft, murder and corruption). He denied charges and was acquitted but it is anyone's guess what someone associated with the dreaded Amin and his security apparatus were up to.In the 70's the very word Amin meant terror. His big and towering 6 ft plus frame, looks and candid speech made him both a hated and dreaded personality. He was a perfect example of the phrase ""Absolute Power corrupts absolutely"". With a good measure of insanity, hedonistic evil and torture his reign was almost that of a modern day Caligula.Since many of us already know who Amin was this movie simply capitalizes on that very powerful presumption or at least expects us to have this hideous view of him and develop or possess hatred towards Amin. However, what you get in this movie is a cute, happy, chubby and cheerful Idi Amin who many would easily think, after watching Forest Whitaker play the role, could have even easily been guided from his evil ways on to a path of sanity and goodness. With his brilliant straight-from-the-heart 10,000 watt smile and innocent eyes Foresh Whitaker plays a very different Idi Amin we aren't used to. Compare videos or images of the real Amin and you'll see there's no way that smile and those eyes of Whitaker could exude evil or fear of the real dictator.Then comes the fictional Scotsman who by twist of fate ends up as Amin's personal physician, friend and adviser. But is everything ok with the Scotsman and did he do right?Here is his list of misdemeanors.Killing of man and beast.1. In one of the early scenes where he confronts Amin, a cow is involved in an accident. The scene is a total goof-up. Amin needs nursing and the Scotsman who is there to assist seems to be more irritated by the agonizing cries of the helpless animal (as he is not able to concentrate on treating Amin) that he shoots it to death in cold blood. The viewer is made to believe that the Scotsman did right by delivering the animal from its pain. But Why didn't he think of administering a sedative? He could have given it an anaesthetic and later put it to sleep or nursed it to health. Better still he could have asked his female companion (who is also a doc) to do something about it. Euthanasia is not even advocated by doctors.2. Wrongly tipping Amin of an innocent colleage and that which cost the colleague his life.3. There is yet another scene where he runs over and kills an injured man to save his life and Amin's during a failed assasination attempt on Amin.4. And finally the most daring of all - trying to kill Amin himself. Amin's wife and the doctor who saves his life in the end are both killed or sacrificed for the Scotsman.And of course not to forget the Scotsman's no.1. misdemeanor - Philandering5. One of his one-night-stands is shown briefly in the beginning of the movie. When you can pass that off as lightly, comes the next one.6. Trying to unsuccessfully seduce his friend's (another Doctor's) wife.7. Having an affair with one of Amin's (of all people) wives and impregnating her in the process and then desperately trying to abort the baby.Be he a criminal, a terror, a despot, a murderer or even a canniabal but wasn't Amin's trust in his friendship betrayed? Or is the film trying to say, ""If your trusted friend is a tyrant, you can go ahead and be a lover to his wife?"" Preposterous!With all this going against the Scotsman how can the movie expect the viewer to offer sympathy for the Scotsman and let him get away with all of this? Well you could if the movie shows the real Amin, but what you get is some chubby, cheerful and guileless looking guy for Amin in Forest Whitaker.Then there is the sour Scotsman - Englishman rivalry which was totally unnecessary because that too backfires on the Scotsman when the latter agrees to help the Scotsman. I really want to know if Scotland is another country totally different in thinking and evolution and views from English. When the Scotsman says ""I am Scottish."", does that mean they are much better off than their cousins and neighbors, the English, who at one time in history had colonized most of the civilization on this earth.This movie also has a very ridiculous scene where the Scotsman meets up with Amin, who with his friends are watching a porn movie under the influence of drugs and alcohol.All the negative aspects hides the good Afro songs and the lovely African landscape the movie has. Only the presumption that Amin was a hated guy saves this movie to some extent.Sharad Patel's ""The rise and Fall of Idi Amin"" made soon after Amin was ousted was in many ways comical and sometimes even exaggerated but at least it showed the world why the infamous despot was so dreaded. But even for those who knew Amin well this movie misleads them.",2,Unfair treatment,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,5299,"['What', 'FAILED', 'attempt', 'show', 'world', 'what', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'was',

1056919,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B000NIVJF4,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[0, 0]","It is a film about haggis and Highland Games that you were hoping for, then surely you will be disappointed. Because The Last King of Scotland has very little to do with the automatically assumed main topic of Scotland and instead takes us away from the Scottish land to a place a bit more remote: Uganda.Directed by Kevin Macdonald and written by Peter Morgan and Jeremy Brock, The Last King of Scotland is a narrative interpretation of the life and power of the former military dictator and president of Uganda Idi Amin. Like many others that he bestowed upon himself, the film gets its title from a self-given name that Amin calls himself.Forest Whittaker plays the role of Idi Amin and his performance leaves no surprises as to how Whittaker won the 2007 Oscar for Best Performance by Leading Actor. Whittaker boldly embodies the power and demeanor of Amin who at times can seem like either your best friend or a ruthless dictator. The mannerisms of Whittaker and the voice that he uses when speaking as Amin seems to fit the role perfectly and one would be hard pressed to imagine a more perfect possible cast for this role.Set in the years of Amin's rule between 1971 and 1979, the film also highlights the work of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy). Garrigan decides that living in Scotland and working in the family medical practice simply was not something that he would be able to do upon graduation from medical school. Therefore, Garrigan decides to literally spin the globe and land his finger on a location where he hoped to serve as a doctor to perhaps a population that needed him more than those back home in Scotland. Of course when he landed on Uganda even Garrigan himself likely was not ready for what was next to come.Garrigan plans to work in a Ugandan medical clinic run by Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson) and her husband. The clinic provides free care to so many in Uganda that simply cannot afford even the most basic of health care. After a run in with Amin, however, Garrigan decides eventually to leave the clinic to take a state run position as Amin's personal doctor.The relationship between Amin and Garrigan certainly grows as time goes on and the level of trust that Amin bestows upon Garrigan is clearly evidenced. The position of doctor quickly grows into confidant with an almost chief of staff level of seniority being reached by Garrigan in Amin's cabinet. However, as power tends to do to some people, quickly the power that Amin has garnered both by popular will and through force rapidly begins to corrupt the government that Amin has built and set out to be a change from the corrupt government that preceded him that he overthrew.Very quickly, as so many of the relationships of those around Amin had done before, the friendship between Garrigan and Amin begins to sour. Due largely in part to an incident involving one of Amin's purported wives, Kay (Kerry Washington) and Garrigan, Garrigan goes from being on top of the Amin leadership level to being an enemy of the Amin dictatorship and a marked man.There is certainly a good deal of blood and gore in this film which though at times is excessive accurately portrays the brutality inflicted by the Amin rule in Uganda. Though perhaps having a more Western frame of mind in theory, Amin certainly rules with an iron fist and ensures that his rule and authority comes at the expense of peace and due process in Uganda. Rather than having the brutality of Amin's rule simply glossed over in the film in actuality the director has done a fine job accurately transferring to film the rule that wreaked so much havoc upon Uganda.The Last King of Scotland is an amazingly well done film that takes a very historic and factual story and transforms it into a very watchable and interesting film. The movie has a way of holding the viewer's attention throughout and even though the nature of the film focuses on a very emotional and intense subject, the viewer can watch the film and not be lost in any complexities that are not well enough hashed out.Certainly after watching this film it is plain to see why The Last King of Scotland has commanded so much respect and praise amongst movie viewers. Unlike the forced appreciation of the leadership of Amin, this film is indeed worthy of all of the praise that it has and continues to receive.",5,The Last King of Scotland Commands Respect,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,4334,"['film', 'haggis', 'Highland', 'Games', 'were', 'hoping', 'then', 'surely', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'automatically', 'assumed', 'main', 'topic', 'Scotland', 'instead', 'away', 'Scottish', 'land', 'place', 'bit', 'more', 'remote', 'Uganda.Directed', 'Kevin', 'Macdonald', 'written', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'Jeremy', 'Brock', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'narrative', 'interpretation', 'life', 'power', 'former', 'military', 'dictator', 'president', 'Uganda', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'many', 'others', 'bestowed', 'film', 'title', 'self-given', 'name', 'Amin', 'himself.Forest', 'Whittaker', 'role', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'performance', 'surprises', 'how', 'Whittaker', 'won', '2007', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Performance', 'Leading', 'Actor', 'Whittaker', 'boldly', 'power', 'demeanor', 'Amin', 'who', 'times', 'can', 'seem', 'best', 'friend', 'ruthless', 'dictator', 'mannerisms', 'Whittaker', 'voice', 'when', 'speaking', 'Amin', 'fit', 'role', 'perfectly', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'imagine', 'more', 'perfect', 'possible', 'cast', 'role.Set', 'years', 'Amin', 'rule', '1971', '1979', 'film', 'also', 'work', 'Dr.', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Garrigan', 'living', 'Scotland', 'working', 'family', 'medical', 'practice', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'graduation', 'medical', 'school', 'Therefore', 'Garrigan', 'literally', 'spin', 'globe', 'land', 'finger', 'location', 'where', 'hoped', 'serve', 'doctor', 'perhaps', 'population', 'needed', 'more', 'back', 'home', 'Scotland', 'course', 'when', 'landed', 'Uganda', 'even', 'Garrigan', 'likely', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'what', 'was', 'next', 'come.Garrigan', 'plans', 'work', 'Ugandan', 'medical', 'clinic', 'run', 'Sarah', 'Merrit', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'husband', 'clinic', 'free', 'care', 'so', 'many', 'Uganda', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'health', 'care', 'run', 'Amin', 'however', 'Garrigan', 'eventually', 'leave', 'clinic', 'take', 'state', 'run', 'position', 'Amin', 'personal', 'doctor.The', 'relationship', 'Amin', 'Garrigan', 'certainly', 'time', 'level', 'trust', 'Amin', 'Garrigan', 'clearly', 'evidenced', 'position', 'doctor', 'quickly', 'confidant', 'almost', 'chief', 'staff', 'level', 'seniority', 'being', 'reached', 'Garrigan', 'Amin', 'cabinet', 'However', 'power', 'tends', 'do', 'people', 'quickly', 'power', 'Amin', 'garnered', 'popular', 'will', 'force', 'rapidly', 'corrupt', 'government', 'Amin', 'built', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'change', 'corrupt', 'government', 'preceded', 'quickly', 'so', 'many', 'relationships', 'Amin', 'had', 'done', 'before', 'friendship', 'Garrigan', 'Amin', 'sour', 'Due', 'largely', 'part', 'incident', 'involving', 'one', 'Amin', 'purported', 'wives', 'Kay', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Garrigan', 'Garrigan', 'being', 'top', 'Amin', 'leadership', 'level', 'being', 'enemy', 'Amin', 'dictatorship', 'marked', 'man.There', 'certainly', 'good', 'deal', 'blood', 'gore', 'film', 'though', 'times', 'excessive', 'accurately', 'brutality', 'inflicted', 'Amin', 'rule', 'Uganda', 'perhaps', 'having', 'more', 'Western', 'frame', 'mind', 'theory', 'Amin', 'certainly', 'rules', 'iron', 'fist', 'rule', 'authority', 'expense', 'peace', 'due', 'process', 'Uganda', 'Rather', 'having', 'brutality', 'Amin', 'rule', 'simply', 'glossed', 'film', 'actuality', 'director', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'accurately', 'transferring', 'film', 'rule', 'wreaked', 'so', 'much', 'havoc', 'Uganda.The', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'very', 'historic', 'factual', 'story', 'transforms', 'very', 'watchable', 'interesting', 'film', 'movie', 'way', 'holding', 'viewer', 'attention', 'even', 'nature', 'film', 'very', 'emotional', 'intense', 'subject', 'viewer', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'lost', 'complexities', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'enough', 'hashed', 'out.Certainly', 'watching', 'film', 'plain', 'see', 'why', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'commanded', 'so', 'much', 'respect', 'praise', 'amongst', 'movie', 'viewers', 'forced', 'appreciation', 'leadership', 'Amin', 'film', 'indeed', 'worthy', 'praise', 'receive']",N/A

But commercialization...the film was fairly accurate (Barbara Schroeder's documentary had some loopholes). For a better, raw depiction of Idi Amin watch ""The Rise and Fall of Idi Amin"" (1981). Ugandan actor Joseph Olita gave a hardcore portrayal of the dictator, and while some of the acts were debatable (e.g was he really a cannibal), the film has some actual people who interacted with Amin in it (e.g. UK reporter Denis Hills who was sentenced to death by Amin then released),gives more background with the Israeli/American/Libyan involvement and is/was not commercialized for American viewers.

1056923,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B000NIVJF4,The Mysterious Traveler,"[1, 2]","THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND(2006)Starring Forest Whittaker and Gillian Anderson.The story of a fictional Scotman who, in 1970, journeys to Uganda and eventually becomes physician to murderous dictator Idi Amin. At first enthusiastic---and taking the opportunity to get some Black female tail---the Scotman eventually realizes that Africa is no place for whitey and wants to go home. Amin hangs him from a pair of meathooks instead.A vanity piece designed to get Whittaker an Oscar for playing Amin, the film is one of those White man goes to someplace third world and learns a lesson movies---usually that white people should not go or get involved with non-white countries. These can work as a ploy to use the character as a device to tell the history of that country---but this only works if the film places the character where he can see things---so the audience can see them and that the character is both likable and has a moral center. The film flounders in that the Scotsman is usually never where he should be and consequently the viewer never learns just what is going on. Unless one is cognizant of Ugandan history, the viewer cannot expect to come away from the film with anything but the most basic idea that Amin overthrew a Communist govt(NO!!!), killed many people and was possibly insane. The Entebbe ending will be inexplicable to anyone who does not know the Entebbe story. Way too much time is expended on the Scotsman having sex with Blacks and not enough with Amin. While Whittaker is very good APPEARING as Amin, he never actually PLAYS Amin. His scenes feel like a series of cameos where a main character will encounter a historical personage for a scene or two and then move on. Amin never develops as a person. We know he has personality and went bad but we never learn why. He just is always as the Scotsman finds him. The film ends during the middle of the Entebbe affair so we never even get to the end of Amins dictatorship. The film just stops. The second flaw is that the Scotsman is a potty mouthed over sexed dim bulb twit who, as, at least, two character observe rightly, really has no reason to live. So the film has no moral center at all. There is nothing there to engage or hold the viewers interest. Whittaker would have been better served by doing a straight forward biography of Amin and dumping the fictional Scotman.Anderson--with a great British accent and looking like sex served up on a plate--gives a solid performance------in a nothing part that could easily should/could have been cut. She seems only to be there for the scene where she walks away from the Scotsman--and the viewer--so we can get a look at that fine jiggly thing she has down there.But is that something we should be concerned with in a film about a homocidal maniac who murdered over 300,000 of his countryman and was allied with MUslem barbarians??Not a bad film.

Because even a womanizer can't possibly be so stupid as to put his life on the line for an affair.

His literally towering presence as Amin is both seductive and terrifying at the same time, something you will not forget easily.The film is not a bio-pic of Ugandan president Amin. It is more like a political thriller seen from the eye of fictional young doctor Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, recently leaving his country Scotland, and arriving at Uganda. Though he is nice as a person, it is suggested that his motive is not always honorable. The film spends some time to set up his character as nave and slightly callous doctor who does not know what he is doing. Actually many will find him annoying, but that is exactly the point.Before him and another doctor Sarah (Gillian Anderson, too brief appearance) President Amin shows up, cheered by the excited crowd. Then Garrigan is given a chance to treat Amin's minor injury, and Amin, who had recently seized the power, in turn invites him to his office and asks him to be his doctor. Amin says to Garrigan, ""Uganda embraces you,"" but they young doctor finds the true meaning of it a bit too late.Director Kevin MacDonald, like his previous ""Touching the Void,"" blends reality and fiction, but for ""The Last King of Scotland"" he leans more on `fiction' side of the script which includes several incredible episodes, like ones you might find in spy novels. Still the film looks often very real. It is actually shot in Uganda and its capital Kampala (by the photographer Anthony Dod Mantle, ""28 Days Later"") and the fate of Amin's second wife Kay (Kerry Washington) is based on truths.Though the film includes violence (torture scenes and one horrible death), the atrocity of Amin's regime is not directly shown on the screen. It is taken as granted that the audiences have already known the fact, and the film focuses on Amin himself who develops paranoia, perfectly presented by Forest Whitaker's great acting. The film is not perfect as thriller, but still that doesn't change the fact that Oscar-winning performance as President Amin alone is worth your time and money.",4,Entertaining Thriller with Towering Presence of Forest Whitaker,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,2146,"['watch', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'see', 'terrific', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'fascinating', 'portrayal', 'evil', 'personified', 'literally', 'towering', 'presence', 'Amin', 'seductive', 'terrifying', 'same', 'time', 'something', 'will', 'not', 'forget', 'easily.The', 'film', 'not', 'bio-pic', 'Ugandan', 'president', 'Amin', 'more', 'political', 'thriller', 'seen', 'eye', 'fictional', 'young', 'doctor', 'Dr.', 'Nicholas', 'Garrigan', 'recently', 'leaving', 'country', 'Scotland', 'arriving', 'Uganda', 'nice', 'person', 'suggested', 'motive', 'not', 'always', 'honorable', 'film', 'time', 'set', 'up', 'character', 'nave', 'slightly', 'callous', 'doctor', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'Actually', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'annoying', 'exactly', 'point.Before', 'doctor', 'Sarah', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'too', 'brief', 'appearance', 'President', 'Amin', 'up', 'cheered', 'excited', 'crowd', 'Then', 'Garrigan', 'given', 'chance', 'treat', 'Amin', 'minor', 'injury', 'Amin', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'seized', 'power', 'turn', 'office', 'be', 'doctor', 'Amin', 'Garrigan', 'Uganda', 'young', 'doctor', 'true', 'meaning', 'bit', 'too', 'late.Director', 'Kevin', 'MacDonald', 'previous', 'Touching', 'Void', 'reality', 'fiction', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'more', 'fiction', 'side', 'script', 'several', 'incredible', 'episodes', 'ones', 'might', 'find', 'spy', 'novels', 'Still', 'film', 'often', 'very', 'real', 'actually', 'shot', 'Uganda', 'capital', 'Kampala', 'photographer', 'Anthony', 'Dod', 'Mantle', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'fate', 'Amin', 'second', 'wife', 'Kay', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'based', 'film', 'violence', 'torture', 'scenes', 'one', 'horrible', 'death', 'atrocity', 'Amin', 'regime', 'not', 'directly', 'shown', 'screen', 'taken', 'as', 'granted', 'audiences', 'have', 'already', 'known', 'fact', 'film', 'Amin', 'who', 'paranoia', 'perfectly', 'presented', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'great', 'acting', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'thriller', 'still', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'President', 'Amin', 'alone', 'time', 'money']",N/A

In this fictionalized account, he is Idi Amin President of Uganda.  He takes over telling his people he will take care of them, no more killing, better health care and so on.  The young Dr. Nicholas Garrigan from Scotland who left there and came on a whim to Uganda to get out from under his father's thumb is gradually charmed by Amin and thinks he can make a difference - a bigger difference - by working for President Amin as his personal physician.  This soon turns out to be a much different task than he imagined including picking the bid for the design of a new building and headquarters for Amin!!  I love how Forest Whitaker shows all the side of Amin, from playful, to charming, to humorous and violent!  James McAvoy also puts in a excellent and seldom mentioned as terrific characterization as the fictional doctor.However, what spoiled the movie for me from being 5 stars is that while the violent scenes were usually cut after brief glimpses of the violence and not too much gore, the sex scenes with Dr. Garrigan and Amin's not-so-favorite wife were far too graphic and totally unnecessary.  I felt that they detracted from the storyline and continuity of the film as a whole.  Do we really need to see all those naked and bouncing body parts to get the idea??  Also, early in the movie when Garrigan first arrives to work with an older British doctor and his younger wife, he also seems to come on to her.

That this is based to some extent on a true story is quite frightening.

As a doctor, he hardly seemed to question or evaluate the situation he was walking into at all.  The movie went from upbeat to a total nightmare.  This was good for me to watch.

It's a human creature, and sometimes a charming one, at that.I have been interested in issues of human evil for some time, as I have heard the word ""evil"" overused and mis-used quite a bit (I actually know people who describe dissenters in their church as ""evil"" - really!)  Real human evil (as opposed to mere name-calling) gets a good movie treatment in this motion picture, and also gets a good scholarly treatment in this book:Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass KillingI know that Forest Whitaker won a well-deserved Academy Award as best actor for his performance, here.  I recall him as being quite warm and soft-spoken in his Oscar acceptance speech.  He seemed a sweet and gentle soul.  Even so, I honestly would not get in an elevator with him after seeing this picture.  I know that's a strange thing to say, but I wouldn't.  I also read somewhere that he would come home to his wife ""in character"" after a day of shooting this movie.  She must be a wonderful woman. I would have divorced the SOB.  He scared me.

1056939,A14WCM5XDC1UT3,B000NIVJF4,William Capodanno,"[1, 1]","Forest Whitaker was simply remarkable as ex-Ugandan thug and dictator Idi Amin.  The screenplay was adapted from a novel centered on a fictional character, Nicholas Garrigan, a Scotsman who becomes Amin's personal physician.  Two of the great aspects of this movie:  Forest Whitaker and the local flavor.  Whitaker justly received an Oscar for his performance.  Not only does he bear an eerie resemblance to the real Amin, but he manages to create a more nuanced and deeper portrait than one might expect.  Amin begins the movie as the new leader of Uganda following a coup.  At first, Whitaker shows a gregarious and personable side of Amin with small flashes of his temper.  As the story evolves, Whitaker deftly shifts his portrayal to the more paranoid, self-centered and ruthless tyrant.Another fantastic aspect of the movie was the choice to film this movie on location in Uganda.  While I can't say that I would have noticed if the film was shot in another African country, but I can say the local casting and scenery were superb.While I thought James McAvoy delivered a strong performance as Garrigan, my biggest critique of the movie was ths screenplay.  I thought certain parts of the screenplay and various aspects of McAvoy's character were poorly written.  For instance, at the outset of the movie, McAvoy comes across as incredibly naive and ill-informed about the turmoil taking place in Uganda, or for that part most of post-colonial Africa at that time.  Additionally, some of the elements of the plot were a bit trite and predictable.  While clearly done for dramatic purposes, they were a little too expected, especially the final 15 minutes.In spite of my few criticisms, this is an incredibly solid movie and contains one of the best performances in recent memory.

I just hated his character so much and it was so hard to watch this movie for that reason, but his performance is so captivating that it was no suprise that he took home the Oscar. I also like James McAvory very much, though he's obviously upstaged by Whitaker effortlessly. Kerry Washington was very convincing as one of the wives whose infidelity caused her a tragic ending.

He brings to life the brutal dictator Idi Amin of Uganda, who during his reign as President of Uganda, was responsible for the murders of 300,000 people, thus earning himself the title of one of history's worst mass murderers. Forest Whitaker is able to personify Amin through his authentic accent, his gestures and mannerisms, and it his electrifying portrayal of Amin that makes this movie shine. The other main character, the fictional Dr Nicholas Garrigan, is played effectively by James McAvoy, and his portrayal of the charmed and naive young doctor who later views Amin with repulsion is convincing. The one complaint I had with the movie was the lack of depth in exploring further the complex character that was Amin, who at first seems the benevolent leader, and gradually turns into a despot, & ruthless murderer, appearing more deranged as his reign finally came to an end with his expulsion out of Uganda.
