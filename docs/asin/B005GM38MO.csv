But it still can be categorized as a gay movie, since the two main characters are gay, even though one of them doesn't realize it until late in the movie. There is a sweet romance among all of the comedic moments, and there are a couple of scenes that tug at the heartstrings. Oh, and the nudity. Good God, the nudity. There are five full frontal scenes. All the male actors in the cast show their ""longhorns"". And Dylan Vox is hilarious in the role of Steve. Everytime he's on screen, be prepared to laugh.

If you can look past the soft-core porn aspects, the misleading cover image  and some of the heavy handed see-this-is-Texas touches, the story is compelling and deft, for the most part. The real story is not in the sex, but three young men coming to terms with their sexual identities in the early 80s. There's awkwardness and fear here, and to the credit of the film makers, they are not obscured by cheesy, cheap cliches.  The atmospherics of life in the early 80s are well placed, aside from a few spurious ""awesomes"" dropped (only valley girls were using the term then), and it is a bittersweet snapshot just before the plague.

Like any ""straight"" boy, Kevin freaks out, and quickly heads out to join a couple of his best friends at a country cabin ... where we learn how some of his fantasies got originated.It's a rather unambitious but entertaining and funny film, by the same writer/director who brought you ""Rock Haven"" and ""Redwoods,"" which had similar vibes. I thought the acting was capable enough, and the gay character, Caesar (Deek Villanueva), was written as non-stereotypical and intelligent.  Unfortunately, the ""straight boy"" characters (which make up most of the cast) didn't fare as well, and were largely portrayed as cartoonish, macho wannabes.Not rated, but would be rated a heavy R for full frontal nudity and simulated sex.

(It also is known by the alternative title, ""Sexy Buffalo Boys"".) The budget for the project, obviously, was limited, but no large-scale effects or artificial settings were required, so a lot of money was not needed (or probably even desirable).Jacob Newton, as Kevin, is a real cutie, coltishly exuberant and sensuously irresistible, perfectly cast in the central role of one truly oversexed young dude, good at bedding the college women, but also, it turns out, even better in bed with the lads (as his gay instincts especially draw him into arousing them at groin level so skillfully by mouth or hand), as he repeatedly finds out to his confused chagrin. Newton's talents as well as his looks, dressed or full-frontally buck-naked, are utterly perfect for the role. As such an erotically mega-charged undergrad college boy, surprised by where his feelings and inclinations, in situations of delicious hilarity, take him, no better casting could be desired! It is very pleasing, as well, that Newton is a native Southerner (in real life hailing from Louisville, Ky.), which helps to make his spoken dialogue to sound so natural in this 2011 film's 1982 Texas setting. And Derek Efrain Villanueva, as C&eacute;sar, is the perfect foil for Newton, a very different kind of young gay dude, one who is very confident in his homosexuality but is alike of more sleekly delicate physique, and of more innately refined sensibilities, than the taller and varyingly more robust young men in the cast who surround him.The two protagonists, though so different, were destined for each other!

Martin,"[5, 5]","This could have been a really good movie, but it wore out its one-joke theme - straight guys who love nothing better than masturbating together while watching porn - about the third time it played out. That may be a powerful and persistent fantasy and an infallible source of amusement for lots of gay men, but it's not for me, and watching it in a movie gets old very fast. It wasn't even remotely believable the first time it happened, and it got less believable every time.The second recurring theme has one man stripping completely naked and standing still for another, fully clothed man to ogle. Each of the five main characters did it once each, with another of the five (two, in one instance) as the clothed ogler. Was that supposed to be funny too, or was it just an extremely clumsy way to get as much full frontal (but as sterile as a nun) nudity as possible into the movie?So the movie is almost unbearably contrived, stupid and unfunny. It has two redeeming strengths, though.Three of the main cast members are genuine Southerners who talk with real Southern accents, not the Hollywood fake-Southern accents non-Southern actors always affect (even Meryl Streep can't get it right) in movies. Non-Southerners must not be able to tell the difference, but I can, and as a long-time transplant to the North, hearing people who talk like me on screen warms my heart and points out how very, very rarely it happens. Even Southern actors almost never use their native accents in movies, which is sad.The movie's other strength is the cast, particularly Derek Villanueva and Dylan Vox, who shine (Jacob Newton, though sort of cute, is a little weak as the lead). I wish someone would remake Longhorns with the same cast but as a serious movie, not a very lame, very unfunny comedy.",3,"Much potential squandered in unfunny comedy, with redeeming strengths",1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,1785,"['could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'wore', 'out', 'one-joke', 'theme', 'straight', 'guys', 'who', 'love', 'nothing', 'better', 'masturbating', 'together', 'watching', 'porn', 'third', 'time', 'played', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'powerful', 'persistent', 'fantasy', 'infallible', 'source', 'amusement', 'lots', 'gay', 'men', 'not', 'watching', 'movie', 'old', 'very', 'fast', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'first', 'time', 'happened', 'got', 'less', 'believable', 'time.The', 'second', 'recurring', 'theme', 'one', 'man', 'stripping', 'completely', 'naked', 'standing', 'still', 'fully', 'clothed', 'man', 'ogle', 'five', 'main', 'characters', 'did', 'once', 'five', 'two', 'one', 'instance', 'clothed', 'ogler', 'Was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'too', 'was', 'just', 'extremely', 'clumsy', 'way', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'full', 'frontal', 'as', 'sterile', 'nun', 'nudity', 'possible', 'movie', 'movie', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'contrived', 'stupid', 'unfunny', 'two', 'redeeming', 'strengths', 'though.Three', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'genuine', 'Southerners', 'who', 'talk', 'real', 'Southern', 'accents', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'fake-Southern', 'accents', 'non-Southern', 'actors', 'always', 'affect', 'even', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'movies', 'Non-Southerners', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'difference', 'can', 'long-time', 'transplant', 'North', 'hearing', 'people', 'who', 'talk', 'screen', 'warms', 'heart', 'points', 'out', 'how', 'very', 'very', 'rarely', 'Even', 'Southern', 'actors', 'almost', 'never', 'use', 'native', 'accents', 'movies', 'sad.The', 'movie', 'other', 'strength', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Derek', 'Villanueva', 'Dylan', 'Vox', 'who', 'shine', 'Jacob', 'Newton', 'sort', 'cute', 'little', 'weak', 'lead', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'remake', 'Longhorns', 'same', 'cast', 'serious', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'lame', 'very', 'unfunny', 'comedy']",N/A

This is based in the dark days of 1982 when it was still cool to be homophobic and absolutely de rigueur in some places - like school work or out in public. We are introduced to jock boy Jacob Newton who plays Kevin. He is busily proving his macho credentials by sleeping with all the cheerleaders, so we have bedroom squelch pretty early on. The thing is he is fantasising that she .... wait for it, is a he! He also has pet names for his house plants - another hugely masculine and heterosexual trait (so I am told!)Then along comes Cesar (pronounced Sayzar - pretentious I know) played by Derek Efrain Villanueva (a bit of a mouthful that - actually that might be a simile for the film). Along with studying Willa Cather, he also agrees to do some nude posing for art class good boy Kevin. Well things get out of hand (that happened to me once actually) and Kevin decides to run off for a weekend of frat male bonding and video porn with the likes of `Cindy does SINcinatti' (for those who haven't seen it, the production values are woeful).This film has some laugh out loud moments and does not rely on the gross out humour that often besmirches, what could have been a funny film. There is some nudity, but not when it comes to the boudoir. There are fashion faux pas a plenty lots of great jock one liners and more than a couple of oninism episodes (do it yourself hand action). Dylan Vox as Steve is pretty hunky and seems to have never visited wardrobe which I did not mind about at all and all the stereo types get challenged.Though made on a small budget it wears its heart on its sleeve and was a really enjoyable movie. It is not a laugh fest, high cinema or particularly challenging, but it put me in a good mood hence the rating. Director David Lewis has done an excellent job, I thought the soundtrack could have been better, but then I am a music snob, and copyright laws are a real pain in America.
