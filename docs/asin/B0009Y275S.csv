In fact, if the movie would have had some nudity, it would have had all the ingredients of a classic Troma movie. It starts out a little show, but this is one of those movies that gets better as it goes along.Toward the end, Slime City becomes a gory, funny splatterfest. They just don't make them like this anymore. Actually they do, but not on a regular basis like they did in the 80's. If you want a movie full of gore, slime, and gross-out gags, Slime City is for you.

916601,AIMR915K4YCN,B0009Y275S,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[2, 3]","SLIME CITY is a fantastic little micro-budget indie, right up there w/ BASKET CASE! Robert Sabin is Alex, the newest tenant in an apartment building full of oddballs. Alex is a nice guy w/ an equally nice girlfriend named Lori (Mary Huner). Of course, all this niceness cannot last, so Alex is soon seduced by his sultry neighbor, Nichole (also played by Huner); and winds up doing naughty things. Alex also has dinner w/ another neighbor named Roman, who serves him some green gloop and a strange liqu&eacute;r, supposedly left by a deceased alchemist named Zachary. Well, Alex wakes up one morning covered in slime, and has an irresistible urge to kill! Kill!! KILL!!! The gore effects that follow are very inventive, especially when considering the low-low budget! Alex is a tormented soul, and Lori must face him in the unbelievable climax, complete w/ dismemberment, decapitation, and a crawling brain! All setting my little black heart aquiver! Director Gregory Lamberson has fashioned a slippery classic of sickening (in a good way) proportions! Also included as a bonus feature is Lamberson's NAKED FEAR. In this one, Robert Sabin stars as an agoraphobe who hasn't left his apartment in ten years. He decides to take in a roomie, only to be caught up in a blood-drenched killing spree! The bodies pile up while the oblivious Sabin character finds love through a 900 number! NF is shot on video, yet has decent direction and enough of a story to make me overlook it's shortcomings.

916602,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B0009Y275S,Grindhouse and Horror,"[0, 1]","This film has a very retro 80s style of film making.  It's got some great 80s style synthesizer scores and the whole film has that great 80s feeling.  The film is slower-paced and it has a much lower body-count than its sequel, but I thought it's the better film.  The sequel was very good, but the gore scenes in this film are more effective and it has a memorable ending gore sequence; The sequel's ending was very disappointing compared to this film. It does have some flaws like becoming a little bit too talky in some spots and it should've had a higher body count because the main reason for seeing this type of film is for the gore, but it's still a classic. The story involves a couple moving into an apartment which was home to an evil deceased alchemist. Once there, he meets a tenant in the apartment who introduces him to something called ""Himalayan Yogurt."" When he eats the yogurt, it causes him to have these episodes that have him being consumed by slime because he's being slowly possessed by Zachary the alchemist. When he kills, he temporarily stops oozing slime and returns to normal. The slime guy goes after a homeless man and a hooker who displays a laughably bad acting performance when she's killed by the slime man. He then gets a thug in a gore scene that copies John Carpenter's THE THING. He also goes after another guy and then there's that really gruesome and prolonged sequence when he's killed at the end, and the only sex scene in the film has no nudity because they both have their clothes on. I personally didn't think the film delivered much in terms of atmosphere or interesting scenery. In between the gore there's character development, some suspense because you wonder when he'll start oozing slime again, and dialogue; some may think that some of this dialogue is boring. Whether or not you get bored during some parts may depend on whether you like Lamberson's directing style and if the films characters and story are interesting to you. His directing in SLIME CITY MASSACRE will probably be more appealing to many people; his directing in this is more geared towards fans of 70s and 80s low-budget horror.I thought the DVD quality is great.  They did a good job with a cheap film that was made decades ago.",5,Slower-paced than SLIME CITY MASSACRE but it's a better film,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,2251,"['film', 'very', 'retro', '80s', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'got', 'great', '80s', 'style', 'synthesizer', 'scores', 'whole', 'film', 'great', '80s', 'feeling', 'film', 'slower-paced', 'much', 'lower', 'body-count', 'sequel', 'thought', 'better', 'film', 'sequel', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'gore', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'effective', 'memorable', 'ending', 'gore', 'sequence', 'sequel', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'compared', 'film', 'have', 'flaws', 'becoming', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'talky', 'spots', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'higher', 'body', 'count', 'main', 'reason', 'seeing', 'type', 'film', 'gore', 'still', 'classic', 'story', 'couple', 'moving', 'apartment', 'was', 'home', 'evil', 'deceased', 'alchemist', 'Once', 'there', 'tenant', 'apartment', 'who', 'something', 'called', 'Himalayan', 'Yogurt', 'When', 'yogurt', 'have', 'episodes', 'have', 'being', 'consumed', 'slime', 'being', 'slowly', 'possessed', 'Zachary', 'alchemist', 'When', 'temporarily', 'oozing', 'slime', 'returns', 'normal', 'slime', 'guy', 'homeless', 'man', 'hooker', 'who', 'laughably', 'bad', 'acting', 'performance', 'when', 'killed', 'slime', 'man', 'then', 'thug', 'gore', 'scene', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'THE', 'THING', 'also', 'guy', 'then', 'really', 'gruesome', 'prolonged', 'sequence', 'when', 'killed', 'end', 'only', 'sex', 'scene', 'film', 'nudity', 'have', 'clothes', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'delivered', 'much', 'terms', 'atmosphere', 'interesting', 'scenery', 'gore', 'character', 'development', 'suspense', 'wonder', 'when', ""'ll"", 'start', 'oozing', 'slime', 'again', 'dialogue', 'may', 'think', 'dialogue', 'boring', 'not', 'get', 'bored', 'parts', 'may', 'depend', 'Lamberson', 'directing', 'style', 'films', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'interesting', 'directing', 'SLIME', 'CITY', 'MASSACRE', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'appealing', 'many', 'people', 'directing', 'more', 'geared', 'towards', 'fans', '70s', '80s', 'low-budget', 'horror.I', 'thought', 'DVD', 'quality', 'great', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'cheap', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'decades', 'ago']",Slime City

916604,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0009Y275S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Slime City (Greg Lamberson, 1988)If you're a fan of cult horror films, you've probably heard of Street Trash, an infamous 1987 splatter comedy by Mike Muro. The year after, sleaze merchant Greg Lamberson made his debut with Slime City, a picture that rips off Street Trash in every conceivable way save the plot. Which, if you think about it, is kind of impressive; you take everything else from a movie and attach a completely different plot to it? I like that. Not enough to change my original rating, because it's still a low-budget piece of tripe with no worthwhile actors, fumble-fingered direction, and the most godawful soundtrack this side of Ravenous, but you've got to admire the guy's gall.Plot: Alex (Robert C. Sabin, who aside from debuting in I Was a Teenage Zombie, has appeared in nothing but Lambersom flicks) moves into a new apartment in a not-so-good neighborhood. On the way in, Alex and his pal Jerry (T. J. Merrick, who never acted again) are greeted by Nicole (Ghoul School's Mary Huner), and they both immediately fall in lust. Which makes life kind of tough for Alex, who has a girlfriend (also played by Huner!) who just won't go there. So he's trying to keep his hands off his new neighbor, but she's coming on strong. Meanwhile, Roman (Dennis Embry, who also never acted again), who lives upstairs, invites Alex up for a meal and feeds him something Roman calls ""Himalayan yogurt.""It's not, of course; in fact, when Alex wakes up the next morning, he's covered in slime and has an almost irresistible urge to go out and kill people. Obviously, there's something very wrong going on in this building besides the rent-control corruption...That Lamberson was able to lure Kealan Patrick Burke, one of the fastest-rising horror authors on the planet, to star in the sequel, 2010's Slime City Massacre (which I haven't seen yet), is some testament as to the lasting effect this movie has had, on at least one consciousness anyway. But man, is this movie awful. The acting isn't all that far above grade-school level, the direction not any better. Even the lighting is bad enough that there are times the movie looks as if it was shot on DV (and I don't mean that as a compliment). This is an amateur film in every respect, and not a good one at that. (Charles Pinion released Twisted Issues the same year, also an amateur film, but so much better than this.) You may want to watch it if you stumble across it just for some of the unintentional hilarity, but you'll regret that you wasted ninety minutes of your life on it afterwards. *",1,"When Variety said ""repulsive"", I don't think they were talking about the effects...",1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,2559,"['Slime', 'City', 'Greg', 'Lamberson', '1988', ""'re"", 'fan', 'cult', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'Street', 'Trash', 'infamous', '1987', 'splatter', 'comedy', 'Mike', 'Muro', 'year', 'sleaze', 'merchant', 'Greg', 'Lamberson', 'made', 'debut', 'Slime', 'City', 'picture', 'Street', 'Trash', 'conceivable', 'way', 'save', 'plot', 'Which', 'think', 'kind', 'impressive', 'take', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'attach', 'completely', 'different', 'plot', 'Not', 'enough', 'change', 'original', 'rating', 'still', 'low-budget', 'piece', 'tripe', 'worthwhile', 'actors', 'fumble-fingered', 'direction', 'most', 'godawful', 'soundtrack', 'side', 'Ravenous', ""'ve"", 'got', 'admire', 'guy', 'gall.Plot', 'Alex', 'Robert', 'C.', 'Sabin', 'who', 'aside', 'debuting', 'Was', 'Teenage', 'Zombie', 'appeared', 'nothing', 'Lambersom', 'flicks', 'new', 'apartment', 'not-so-good', 'neighborhood', 'way', 'Alex', 'pal', 'Jerry', 'T.', 'J.', 'Merrick', 'who', 'never', 'acted', 'again', 'are', 'greeted', 'Nicole', 'Ghoul', 'School', 'Mary', 'Huner', 'immediately', 'fall', 'lust', 'Which', 'life', 'kind', 'tough', 'Alex', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'also', 'played', 'Huner', 'who', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'trying', 'keep', 'hands', 'new', 'neighbor', 'coming', 'strong', 'Meanwhile', 'Roman', 'Dennis', 'Embry', 'who', 'also', 'never', 'acted', 'again', 'who', 'upstairs', 'invites', 'Alex', 'up', 'meal', 'feeds', 'something', 'Roman', 'Himalayan', 'yogurt', 'not', 'course', 'fact', 'when', 'Alex', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'covered', 'slime', 'almost', 'irresistible', 'urge', 'go', 'out', 'kill', 'people', 'Obviously', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'going', 'building', 'rent-control', 'corruption', 'Lamberson', 'was', 'able', 'lure', 'Kealan', 'Patrick', 'Burke', 'one', 'fastest-rising', 'horror', 'authors', 'planet', 'star', 'sequel', '2010', 'Slime', 'City', 'Massacre', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'testament', 'lasting', 'effect', 'movie', 'had', 'least', 'one', 'consciousness', 'anyway', 'man', 'movie', 'awful', 'acting', ""n't"", 'far', 'grade-school', 'level', 'direction', 'not', 'better', 'Even', 'lighting', 'bad', 'enough', 'are', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'DV', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'compliment', 'amateur', 'film', 'respect', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'Charles', 'Pinion', 'released', 'Twisted', 'Issues', 'same', 'year', 'also', 'amateur', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'stumble', 'just', 'unintentional', 'hilarity', ""'ll"", 'regret', 'wasted', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'life', 'afterwards', '*']",Slime City
916605,A1H7PH075VTHO8,B0009Y275S,Sir Jub-Jub,"[8, 11]","""Slime City"" is best described as a student film. The effects, camera work, acting and overall production are on par with what one would expect from a bunch of film students tasked with making a feature film. There are a lot of missed opportunities that would have made this film much better. For one, the film is played seriously, where comedy in the vein of ""Re-Animator"" would have been a better idea. The story is similar to many other ""strange goings on for a new tenant in an apartment complex"" type films. The new tenant is surrounded by oddball neighbors and soon becomes engulfed in a bizarre plot to allow the rebirth of some long dead occultist. The main selling point of the film is its gross-out effects as characters are consumed by a slimey substance that causes them to kill to retain their human form. The effects would have worked better if this film had played as a comedy as they are too over the top to be realistic. The DVD is well done with an additional feature by the same director as well as commentary and four trailers. There is also a making of segment. The effort in making this film is commendable but the film itself just isnt very good. The print used also has some damage and scratches, etc. throughout. I guess if you are into low budget films like ""The Corpse Grinders"" and ""Blood Feast"", you might like this.",2,Slimey,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,1345,"['Slime', 'City', 'best', 'described', 'student', 'film', 'effects', 'camera', 'work', 'acting', 'overall', 'production', 'are', 'par', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'bunch', 'film', 'students', 'tasked', 'making', 'feature', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'film', 'played', 'seriously', 'where', 'comedy', 'vein', 'Re-Animator', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'idea', 'story', 'similar', 'many', 'other', 'strange', 'goings', 'new', 'tenant', 'apartment', 'complex', 'type', 'films', 'new', 'tenant', 'surrounded', 'oddball', 'neighbors', 'soon', 'becomes', 'engulfed', 'bizarre', 'plot', 'allow', 'rebirth', 'long', 'dead', 'occultist', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'film', 'gross-out', 'effects', 'characters', 'are', 'consumed', 'slimey', 'substance', 'kill', 'retain', 'human', 'form', 'effects', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'played', 'comedy', 'are', 'too', 'top', 'be', 'realistic', 'DVD', 'well', 'done', 'additional', 'feature', 'same', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'four', 'trailers', 'also', 'making', 'segment', 'effort', 'making', 'film', 'commendable', 'film', 'just', 'isnt', 'very', 'good', 'print', 'used', 'also', 'damage', 'scratches', 'etc', 'guess', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'Corpse', 'Grinders', 'Blood', 'Feast', 'might', 'like']",Slime City
