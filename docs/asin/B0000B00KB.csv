769655,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000B00KB,A Customer,"[3, 3]","Summary:Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) and his partner, K.C. Calden (Josh Hartnett), are homicide detectives in Hollywood.  But, that's not all...  Gavilan also dabbles in real estate as a second income and K.C. is a Yoga instructor and 'wannabe' actor.The movie begins with the murders of the members of an up and coming rap group, H2OClick.  Gavilan and Calden are called in to investigate the murders only to find that it was actually the owner of the recording studio that had a contract with the group that ordered the murders, Antoine Sartain (Isaiah Washington).  As it just so happens, the former partner of Calden's father, Leroy Wasley (Dwight Yoakam), is in charge of Sartain's security - he hires the hitmen then kills them when they've finished their jobs.The rest of the movie involves Gavilan and Calden tracking down Wasley and Sartain while at the same time Gavilan is trying to make a huge sell and Calden, who does the Yoga instruction just to meet women, is pursuing a career as an actor.My Comments:I do have to admit that I laughed while watching this movie, but only about four times.  This movie was supposed to be a comedy, really!  But, well, it falls dramatically short on the delivery.  When I think of the ideal people for a buddy cop comedy, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett are not the first two names that come to mind.  Geez, if Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy can't pull off a buddy cop movie, Ford and Hartnett don't have a prayer.Anyway, the story is almost interesting but only because it shows pretty much every cop as having a second job.  Whether or not this is true to life, I don't know; I'm not a cop.  But it was at least a little bit new.  There are a number of problems with the story, but the major problem is the investigation of Gavilan by Lt. Bennie Macko (Bruce Greenwood).  The movie keeps trying to give some explanation for the investigation, but it never actually makes any sense.  Supposedly they think Gavilan is taking money, but then they accuse him of meeting with 'bad people' and prostitutes and who knows what else.  They only way this added to the film was by giving Gavilan someone to sleep with, Ruby (Lena Olin), who also just happens to be Macko's ex-wife.  Also, the connection between Wasley and Calden is another big, big coincidence that just doesn't work. It's almost as though the writers found as many things as they could to possibly complicate the movie and put them all into it with the hopes that people wouldn't see this as 'just another buddy cop' movie.  The result, just another buddy cop movie... but one that isn't funny and has far too many coincidences.The acting is okay, but, despite being a big fan of Harrison Ford, I really didn't think he was that great in this film.  This just isn't his genre.  He needs to stick the 'drama with a bit of action' genre.  As for Josh Hartnet, well, he was okay, but again, not very convincing.  Also, neither of these two are funny.  The only funny elements of the movie revolved around Gavlin's make real estate deals while chasing Sartain.  It didn't really make any sense, but it was a little bit funny.  The rest of the acting was about what you would expect from an episode of NYPD Blue.Overall, as buddy cop movies go, this isn't funny, the story is too complicated for its own good, and the actors are out of place.  I don't believe any of the buddy cop movies following Rush Hour have even come close to equaling its humor and action; this is not the exception.  I would highly not recommend this movie.",1,Is Harrison Ford really this desperate for roles?,1064707200,"09 28, 2003",2003,3531,"['Summary', 'Joe', 'Gavilan', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'partner', 'K.C', 'Calden', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'are', 'homicide', 'detectives', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'Gavilan', 'also', 'real', 'estate', 'second', 'income', 'K.C', 'Yoga', 'instructor', ""'wannabe"", 'actor.The', 'movie', 'murders', 'members', 'up', 'coming', 'rap', 'group', 'H2OClick', 'Gavilan', 'Calden', 'are', 'called', 'investigate', 'murders', 'only', 'find', 'was', 'actually', 'owner', 'recording', 'studio', 'had', 'contract', 'group', 'ordered', 'murders', 'Antoine', 'Sartain', 'Isaiah', 'Washington', 'just', 'so', 'former', 'partner', 'Calden', 'father', 'Leroy', 'Wasley', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'charge', 'Sartain', 'security', 'hitmen', 'then', 'when', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'jobs.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'Gavilan', 'Calden', 'tracking', 'down', 'Wasley', 'Sartain', 'same', 'time', 'Gavilan', 'trying', 'make', 'huge', 'sell', 'Calden', 'who', 'Yoga', 'instruction', 'just', 'meet', 'women', 'pursuing', 'career', 'actor.My', 'Comments', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'laughed', 'watching', 'movie', 'only', 'about', 'four', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'really', 'well', 'dramatically', 'short', 'delivery', 'When', 'think', 'ideal', 'people', 'buddy', 'cop', 'comedy', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'are', 'not', 'first', 'two', 'names', 'come', 'mind', 'Geez', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'Ford', 'Hartnett', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'prayer.Anyway', 'story', 'almost', 'interesting', 'only', 'pretty', 'much', 'cop', 'having', 'second', 'job', 'not', 'true', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'cop', 'was', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'new', 'are', 'number', 'problems', 'story', 'major', 'problem', 'investigation', 'Gavilan', 'Lt.', 'Bennie', 'Macko', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'movie', 'trying', 'give', 'explanation', 'investigation', 'never', 'actually', 'sense', 'Supposedly', 'think', 'Gavilan', 'taking', 'money', 'then', 'accuse', 'meeting', ""'bad"", 'people', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'what', 'else', 'only', 'way', 'added', 'film', 'was', 'giving', 'Gavilan', 'someone', 'sleep', 'Ruby', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'who', 'also', 'just', 'be', 'Macko', 'ex-wife', 'Also', 'connection', 'Wasley', 'Calden', 'big', 'big', 'coincidence', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'almost', 'writers', 'found', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'possibly', 'complicate', 'movie', 'put', 'hopes', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', ""'just"", 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'result', 'just', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'one', ""n't"", 'funny', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'coincidences.The', 'acting', 'okay', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'genre', 'stick', ""'drama"", 'bit', 'action', 'genre', 'Josh', 'Hartnet', 'well', 'was', 'okay', 'again', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'Also', 'two', 'are', 'funny', 'only', 'funny', 'elements', 'movie', 'revolved', 'Gavlin', 'make', 'real', 'estate', 'deals', 'chasing', 'Sartain', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'funny', 'rest', 'acting', 'was', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'episode', 'NYPD', 'Blue.Overall', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movies', 'go', ""n't"", 'funny', 'story', 'too', 'complicated', 'own', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movies', 'following', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'have', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'equaling', 'humor', 'action', 'not', 'exception', 'would', 'highly', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

769659,AM2ITPX4ZEUIA,B0000B00KB,"Amazon Customer ""Wildrider""","[0, 1]","""Hollywood Homicide"" wasn't what I expected at all.  First off, it was a lot funnier and a lot more fun than I had been led to believe from the advertisements, which seemed to show a straightforward action-cop flick.  But that's misleading.  Instead, it's a lighthearted romp much in the style of a ""Die Hard"" or ""True Lies,"" a high-speed action film with a good deal of tongue-in-cheek humor and poking fun at everyone, notably the age-old, crusty, buddy-cop movie itself (heck, it's just this side of being flat-out satire).  Cell phones, everyone in Hollywood wants to be an actor or to sell a script, old guys vs. young guys, all the cliches.  They're not in here by accident.Harrison Ford stars as Joe Gavilan, put-upon Los Angeles police sergeant detective with a handful of ex-wives and a faltering real estate business who knows his police work but struggles to deal with his life outside the department.  His partner, K.C. Calden, played by Josh Hartnett, is a young idealistic yoga instructor who has a way with the ladies and is apparently only on the force because his father was.  What he REALLY wants to be is an actor (of course!).  But to give the story a little meat (or, at least, protein-based tofu), naturally, his father was killed on duty under some shady circumstances, and his shady partner got off scot-free.  That's foreshadowing, mark of quality literature.  No, the story isn't deep (unless it's so deep it's shallow).  Joe and K.C. are called to the scene of a brutal shooting where an up-and-coming rap group were senselessly slain in apparent executioner style.  The chase is on.  While the heroes search for the gunmen, we in the audience find out right away that of course they are only hired guns -- they arrive at a pre-arranged meeting spot to get their money for carrying out the hit where they are ruthlessly slaughtered by the big boss and henchman, who turn out to be the head of the rap group's record label, Antoine Sartain (Isaiah Washington) and (ta da!) the shady partner of Hartnell's father, Leroy Wasley (Dwight Yoakam).  A couple of hops, skips, and jumps, and you know the score, the bad guys lose and the good guys win.No, it's not a terribly complex storyline; it's also paved with dangling plotlines which were probably tossed in to show ""there's a life outside of this story,"" but it was often frustrating to be shown tidbits with no relation to the main storyline (it's not the story, it's the jokes which are important); but where ""Hollywood Homicide"" comes up all right is the interaction between Ford and Hartnett.  Both turn in easy, comfortable, and likeable performances, making their characters fun and interesting, particularly Ford, who is at his butt-kicking, getting-his-butt-kicked best (probably a bit of a waste in a throwaway film like this, but hey, he's Harrison Ford).  Likewise, supporting characters are fun and interesting, including Martin Landau as a aging movie producer, Master P as a rap club owner Ford is trying to sell a house to, and Gladys Knight as the mother of a witness on the lamb.  The main problem lies in the two-D villains.  Not only are we shown from the onset who the bad guys are, it's fairly obvious from the beginning that our heroes pretty much know, too, so it's only a drawn-out chase, leading to the actual chase (with a terrific send-up of LA high speed chases, including media choppers).  While Washington is reasonably convincing in his role (Hey, look out, Joe, he's a bad guy!  Joe knows already), it's very much a single-celled character; with Yoakam it's almost worse, because it's just an amalgamation of the same character(s) he's been playing in his last few major releases -- a character who is a swaggering bully like Doyle (Sling Blade), cold and cruel like Raoul (Panic Room), and hysterical and whining like Glasscock (Newton Boys).  I can appreciate wanting to play so far from type, but when you play against ""type"" all the time, guess what... it's typecasting again.  It's time for Yoakam to show he can play more than a thug.The action is non-stop, the pacing even, the acting pretty good for a bit of fluff like this is.  Very enjoyable.

If your thinking not much happens in the trailer or there doesn't seem to be much sense of story, you're right. That's the movie. The first full hour of the film is almost completely pointless. The story seems void of any direction whatsoever.

The Josh Hartnett and Harrison Ford have almost no chemistry and neither one are believable as cops and the comedy... well there really isn't any. There should be. You're watching, and scenes play out as if they were supposed to be funny, but you aren't laughing....All throughout watching this movie I could not help but observe that Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett have no real sense of comedy. Judging by the rest of the performances of supporting characters, neither does the director. I kept wondering to myself, what is the point of this movie? It's definately trying to fill the shoes of an action/comedy, but there's as little action as there is comedy. And what is with the rap/hip-hop soundtrack? Even though this film is loosely about the investigation of some rap stars' murders, it seems completely out of place to the story and the target audience.None of the actors give poor performances (excepting their lack of being funny), and I'd even go so far as to say this is the best I've seen Josh Hartnettt perform.

769662,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0000B00KB,Benjamin,"[0, 0]","HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE was a dumb, formulaic  and downright silly cop movie about a grizzled old pro who's under the glare of Internal Affairs and, get this, his new partner - a young cop driven by the need to avenge the death of his father, a great officer gunned down in the line of duty under mysterious circumstances. The case they're currently working on, the murder of a rap group, implicates rich men in positions of power and may be more than it seems.Is there any chance that all of these plots won't all be tied together in the same case? Of course not. That's like asking if it ends in an elaborate car chase scene. Duh.It's not a great movie. It's probably not even a very good movie. But, a funny thing happened while I was watching it. I enjoyed myself.I didn't care if it was predictable or bad. I had fun. I had fun not because it was predictable or bad. I had fun because Harrison Ford proved once again that he's the most charismatic, natural actor onscreen. I had fun because a lot of the jokes weren't incredibly groan-inducing. I enjoyed Josh Hartnett's character getting silly little moments - though I didn't for one minute buy that the ""death of my father"" [stuff] was anything more than an intentional parody of almost every cop movie ever made. I enjoyed that the cop-movie elements, at times, become beside-the-point as the film goes off on tangents involving Harrison Ford talking real estate or Josh Hartnett rehearsing for a bad, bad production of STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE while also making time as a yoga instructor.Ron Shelton, who's made some good movies and one great one, is too smart to have done a movie this predictable on purpose. It HAS to be a parody. It HAS to be in on its own joke of a premise. The film is only slightly less subtle than THE NAKED GUN when it comes to its own wink-wink capabilities.I mean, why else would a film be more interested in its cop characters' side jobs than in their roles as cops?At the point where a cop movie as great and original as NARC can be released, HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE cannot have been playing its eye-rolling plot twists, stereotypical villains and deus ex machina conventions at all seriously.It's either clever or intensely stupid.

It's not Beverly Hills Cop, Lethal Weapon, or even within sniffing distance of Chinatown.  It's borderline whether or not it can be classified as a comedy or not.  For all that, it's a harmless piece of amusement that has lots of little disparate elements which individually are appealing but which never gel into a cohesive unit.  Sure it's annoying, but it doesn't mean the film is a complete waste of time.What the film has going for it: the overall concept, the location, the sardonic travelogue quality/tribute to Los Angeles, Martin Landau, Ron Shelton's track record as a director, a great car chase sequence, and some very funny character quirks on the part of Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett.  Yes, these are not things to hang your hat on, but they do provide some good moments.  Ford never looks quite comfortable and Hartnett is fine once you accept that fact that he's just an overgrown goofball, but the plot is flimsy at best and seems to be just a sideshow for the interplay between Ford and Hartnett.One other note about Harrison Ford - his image is such that for him to step into what is perceived as a comedy is almost a culture shock.  You don't know whether or not you should laugh or feel awkward.  Me, I tended to laugh more often than not.Ron Shelton has proven himself to be a very competent filmmaker and if he missteps here a bit, it's not for lack of trying.  You can see that somewhere in this mess there's a decent film but it shouldn't be the audience's responsibility to find it.

769669,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B0000B00KB,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[1, 4]","Indiana, say it isn't so? Please say that making films like ""Hollywood Homicide"" isn't what has become of Han Solo. Please.It's hard watching screen legends tarnish their legacy. Marlon Brando tried his best to make everyone forget his earlier performances with repeated bombs like ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" and now it seems that Harrison Ford is content on doing the same.Ford is a homicide detective trying to make ends meet as he investigates the gangland style murder of a hip-hop group.Forgive the glossing over the plot. Just trying to follow the film's example.After all, the reason for this film is not the plot, it's to see Ford and co-star Josh Hartnett take their turn at the buddy comedy flick.While shows like CSI making cops look like the smartest, wittiest people on the planet, director Ron Shelton (the force behind ""Bull Durham"" and ""White Men Can't Jump"") decides to play his detectives a little differently.K.C. (Hartnett ""Pearl Harbor"") doubts whether or not he wants to remain an officer or chase his dream of becoming an actor. K.C.'s also a yoga instructor who is only teaching the class for the slew of 20-something year old would-be actresses who attend the class.While his partner has a rotating lineup for his bedmate, Joe Gavilan (Ford) is enjoying his three-week anniversary with Ruby, (Lena Olin from ""Alias"") a radio psychic.The film's walking joke (it starts off as a running joke, but it gets used so much it had to slow its pace to a walk) is that Gavilan is also selling real estate and buyers and sellers keep calling him at the wrong time trying to close deals. It's good for a few chuckles early on, but it becomes too much a crutch joke after a while to remain humorous.In chasing a suspect, our low-rent Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker pursue him around a duck pond. The suspect paddles with his hand on a paddleboat while K.C. runs around the lake telling him to step away from the duck waste. My, how clever.This truly is the film's defining moment. But that definition could read ""Hollywood Homicide"" - n. 1. Seriously unfunny buddy flick 2. Yet another would be Lethal Weapon 3. Last call of Harrison Ford's movie career.With the film's comedy component dying on the respirator, the dramatic aspect doesn't fare any better either. K.C.'s father was killed in the line of duty and there was suspicion that his partner may have had something to do with it.Just so the audience can understand everything, K.C. kindly explains to his partner of four months that the investigation was closed before anything was discovered.Matter-of-factly, Joe offers to call on some favors and learn what happened on the case. That's not the kind of conversation that happens oh, say, on the first month?Dollars to donuts (pun intended) that K.C.'s father's partner is running around involved in the criminal shenanigans. Whatever were the odds?Bruce Greenwood (""Double Jeopardy"") gets a thankless role as an Internal Affairs officer intent on bringing Joe down for humiliating him years ago. It's another needless subplot in a movie so wrapped up with creating new subplots that the whole point of the movie doesn't get addressed until three-fourths of the way.Shockingly (gasp) all of these clich&eacute; puzzle pieces fit exactly into place. As K.C. pieces everything together, there strangely was no ""well duh!"" subtitle at the bottom of the screen.Speaking of thankless roles, Isaiah Washington (""Romeo Must Die"") gets typecast once again as the bad guy and gets to be quite menacing until he gets into a slugfest with Ford.Washington is a talented actor desperately need of better material.Clearly, there's some sort of an attempt to mimic the cop buddy-flick feel of ""Lethal Weapon"" here, but even at the series' most outrageous, there was a modicum of common sense. Imagine if you will, instead of having the younger and more unbalanced Mel Gibson chasing after the bad guy, his older, veteran partner Danny Glover is going after them. Granted, Ford is a much bigger star than Hartnett likely will ever be so it's understandable that he's treated like the big gun. But Ford barely looks like he could run two blocks, let alone maintain a citywide chase without passing out.

The trailer pretty much gives away the plot which at some points in the movie goes haywire it seems like the studio was forcing Ron Shelton to give everything into the movie so it could be a big summer tent pole release but alas for a movie of this nature to be a big summer tent pole release in my opinion I would have changed a few things. Number one- replace the non acting Master P with the more rounded Mos Def (who can make any bad movie pretty enjoyable hence his work in Showtime). Number two - make the film R rated you can't make a movie about Gangster rappers and not have profanity, I mean honestly how many ganster rappers do you know that release clean CD'S by choice ? As much sex as Hartnett was getting the film could have showed some T&A ! Number three - Give the very underrated Isiah Washingtion more screen time as the villain !

Although Ford and Hartnett have good chemsitry the film that is made here would have been better suited as a winter or fall release.

769675,A3R3JLC0UI2UIP,B0000B00KB,Dr. Rocco Malacca,"[0, 1]","Hollywood Homicide is the best movie Harrison Ford has made in years, and his character, Joe Gallivan, is perhaps his most interesting one since Indiana Jones.  Josh Hartnett turns in his best role to date as Ford's younger, inexperienced partner.  This movie does what few other movies do, it features the second careers of the officers.  Many officers in real life have secondary incomes, and it is nice to see a movie focus on this aspect instead of providing cliched cop stereotypes who live and breathe police work and nothing else.  Ford is a struggling real estate agent and Hartnett is a yoga instructor who wants to become an actor.  Throughout the film, he is rehearsing for his role in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and Ford is trying to sell the house of a movie producer (Martin Landau) to a club owner whose business was the scene of a homicide.There are a number of cameos as well, including Smokey Robinson as a cabbie and Lou Diamond Phillips as an undercover cop dressed as a prostitute.  There are a number of funny moments, including a hilarious foot chase scene and a dual interrogation scene where Ford won't quit answering his phone and Hartnett lapses into his yoga routine.  Ford's phone conversations during the chase scenes at the end are not to be missed.  Lolita Davidovich appears as the head of an escourt service, Ford's girlfriend is a radio psychic who helps out with the investigation, and Dwight Yoakum plays a cop turned bad who helps the main antagonist commit several murders.The blend of humor and action works well as the two leads play off each other.  It is nice to see a cop movie where the partners are friends all along instead of the biggest cliche ever, a pair of partners who badger at each other constantly and learn a ""lesson"" at the end.  Ford is a mentor to his partner, but never misses a chance to give him a hard time.  Ron Shelton (Bull Durham) handles the direction with veteran ease, and provides a touch of Hollywood noir while at the same time adding some realism to his characters.  I would recommend this to any fan of Ford, especially to those who thought he was losing his touch as one of the greatest American actors.",4,Hollywood Homicide Is Ford's Best In Years!,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,2180,"['Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'best', 'movie', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'made', 'years', 'character', 'Joe', 'Gallivan', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'one', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'Ford', 'younger', 'inexperienced', 'partner', 'movie', 'what', 'few', 'other', 'movies', 'do', 'second', 'careers', 'officers', 'Many', 'officers', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'secondary', 'incomes', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'focus', 'aspect', 'instead', 'providing', 'cliched', 'cop', 'stereotypes', 'who', 'live', 'breathe', 'police', 'work', 'nothing', 'else', 'Ford', 'struggling', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'Hartnett', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'who', 'become', 'actor', 'film', 'rehearsing', 'role', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Ford', 'trying', 'sell', 'house', 'movie', 'producer', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'club', 'owner', 'business', 'was', 'scene', 'are', 'number', 'cameos', 'well', 'including', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'cabbie', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'undercover', 'cop', 'dressed', 'prostitute', 'are', 'number', 'funny', 'moments', 'including', 'hilarious', 'foot', 'chase', 'scene', 'dual', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'where', 'Ford', 'wo', ""n't"", 'quit', 'answering', 'phone', 'Hartnett', 'yoga', 'routine', 'Ford', 'phone', 'conversations', 'chase', 'scenes', 'end', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Lolita', 'Davidovich', 'head', 'escourt', 'service', 'Ford', 'girlfriend', 'radio', 'psychic', 'who', 'out', 'investigation', 'Dwight', 'Yoakum', 'cop', 'turned', 'bad', 'who', 'main', 'antagonist', 'commit', 'several', 'murders.The', 'blend', 'humor', 'action', 'works', 'well', 'two', 'leads', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'nice', 'see', 'cop', 'movie', 'where', 'partners', 'are', 'all', 'along', 'instead', 'biggest', 'cliche', 'ever', 'pair', 'partners', 'who', 'badger', 'other', 'constantly', 'learn', 'lesson', 'end', 'Ford', 'mentor', 'partner', 'never', 'chance', 'give', 'hard', 'time', 'Ron', 'Shelton', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'direction', 'veteran', 'ease', 'touch', 'Hollywood', 'noir', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'adding', 'realism', 'characters', 'would', 'recommend', 'fan', 'Ford', 'especially', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'losing', 'touch', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'actors']",N/A

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE, the heavily mocked 2003 offering starring Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, is in my opinion well put together and extremely funny. Though at its most tiresome it was like a marriage between L.A. STORY  and BEVERLY HILLS COP, it is for the main part a funny and interesting look at the detectives from Hollywood Homicide.Sgt. Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford with an interesting Hispanic surname here) juggles his great talents as a homicide detective with his not-too-great talents as a real estate agent. He's partnered up with Det. K. C. Calden (Josh Hartnett), a randy little part-time yoga instructor-wanna-be-actor. Calden is perhaps what Gavilan used to be, a hit with the ladies and very good at his moonlight job. Calden, however, sucks as a cop. Gavilan is determined to mentor him as much as possible.They get mixed up in a rap-record-industry-related murder mystery, and part of the fun is watching Gavilan 'get his man' while wheeling and dealing a major house sale (with a delightful cameo by Martin Landau). Meanwhile, Calden struggles to recall the names of all the one-night stands he keeps encountering. It is hilarious to see the two detectives totally fail to keep their moonlighting apart from their detective work, and that is the L.A. STORY aspect that annoyed me a little. But also I laughed like hell.The great Bruce Greenwood appears as Lieutenant Macko, a jerk who wants Gavilan permanently galvanized in a cement overcoat, Dwight Yoakam as crooked, murderous Det. Wasley, and other great cameos by Eric Idle as an arrestee in custody for soliciting prostitutes, and Lou Diamond Phillips as a cop called Wanda--a sexy and smart appearance with Phillips in drag, undercover. When Gavilan picks him up for a brief conference and Calden witnesses it, Calden mutters sadly, ""say it ain't so, Joe!"" And Phillips looks spectacular in drag!There is a cast list a mile long with this thing, so I won't list anyone else. What I seem to recall when this was new was that critics lambasted Ford for his appearance in this unworthy, oddball comedy. It is NOT unworthy, and Ford hands in a near-genius comic performance here. Robin Williams could not have done it. The others also perform beautifully, and with Eric Idle walking on near the beginning, we get a slight whiff of  A FISH CALLED WANDA.Enjoy this and laugh, and...keep your eye/ears peeled. It is meant as ""detective light"", or ""diet homicide"" or whatever--but it's fun and keeps you watching.

The reviews weren't kind (though a number of reliable critics, including Ebert & Roeper, Rob Blackwell, and David Cornelius gave it positive marks), so undoubtedly low expectations on my part made this a more enjoyable venture for me, or maybe it's just a solid action/comedy. Either way, this continues my personal Harrison Ford streak (dating back to Star Wars, there hasn't been a movie of his I've seen that I've genuinely disliked, not even the strictly mediocre Random Hearts).Ford stars as Joe Gavilan, a Hollywood detective moonlighting as a real-estate broker who's desperate to sell a house just to pay off his mortgage and alimony payments. His partner, the much younger K.C. Calden (Josh Hartnett), is also a yoga instructor/aspiring actor. Their latest case involves the murder of a group of rappers, a hit possibly called by producer Antoine Sartain (Isaiah Washington). But their attempts to solve the crime are hindered by an I.A. investigation led by Bennie Macko (Bruce Greenwood), an old rival of Gavilan's who's determined to make his life a living hell.For about the first twenty minutes, Hollywood Homicide stumbles and sputters with awkwardly placed jokes involving food orders and real estate deals. But the randomness of the jokes and the situations improved and grew on me. It's part of the movie's appeal, basically focusing on two cops who have more pressing concerns on their minds than the homicide case they're on. As a matter of fact, the ""main"" plot is barely given any genuine development, it's just there to provide the movie with a frame with which the leads can interact and get into some physical action.The movie's success lies mainly with leads Ford and Hartnett, who, surprisingly, aren't the typical mis-matched buddy pairing I was expecting (they actually get along pretty well). Ford's talent with comedy is not a surprise, his gruff manner and deadpan approach is perfect for this material. The running cell phone and real estate gag would normally feel out of place and probably fall flat, but in Ford's capbable hands, the gags are often hilarious. Hartnett is just right as the playboy movie star-wannabe, not exactly a stretch for the young actor, but still a decent performance.Despite virtually no action in the opening hour, the movie climaxes with a twenty-minute, non-stop action sequence that's filled with car and foot chases, shootouts, and a couple of scuffles and fistfights. It's a thrilling segment that's easily the movie's highlight. There are several memorable comic setpieces: a chase involving a paddleboat, an I.A. interrogation constantly interrupted by cell phone calls, Ford chasing a villain with a girl's bike (actually my favorite scene of the whole film), Hartnett commandeering an SUV with a family of passengers still inside, and a bloodied Ford brandishing a gun and making the finishing touches on a real estate deal in an elevator full of frightened women. Incidentally, three of those scenes are set in the final half-hour, accompanying the action sequences.Hollywood Homicide's not without its fair share of flaws. The film boasts one subplot too many, mainly in Ford's underdeveloped romance with a psychic (Lena Holin), Hartnett's acting goals, and a silly ""father who was a cop, but was killed in the line of duty"" cliche storyline that should have been completely excised. The Gavilan-Macko rivalry is lazily resolved, more of an afterthought on the filmmaker's part than an actual conclusion. One scene involving a handcuffed prisoner with a loaded gun is just pointless; I said before the movie's random storylines were part of its charm but this is a little too random.But the movie succeeds at what it intends to be, a buddy-cop comedy where the cops actually feel like buddies and not hot-headed partners always at each other's throats over trivial matters. Such an approach may be what you're expecting, but believe me, the movie feels much fresher the way it is and is all the more enjoyable for that reason.",4,Quite an enjoyable action/comedy.,1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,4220,"['Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'had', 'misfortune', 'being', 'released', 'alongside', 'bigger', 'f/x', 'oriented', 'blockbusters', 'unfortunately', 'got', 'lost', 'box', 'office', 'shuffle', 'summer', '2003', 'putting', 'up', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'numbers', 'reviews', 'were', ""n't"", 'kind', 'number', 'reliable', 'critics', 'including', 'Ebert', 'Roeper', 'Rob', 'Blackwell', 'David', 'Cornelius', 'gave', 'positive', 'marks', 'so', 'undoubtedly', 'low', 'expectations', 'part', 'made', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'venture', 'maybe', 'just', 'solid', 'action/comedy', 'way', 'personal', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'streak', 'dating', 'back', 'Star', 'Wars', ""n't"", 'been', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'genuinely', 'disliked', 'not', 'even', 'strictly', 'mediocre', 'Random', 'Hearts', '.Ford', 'Joe', 'Gavilan', 'Hollywood', 'detective', 'moonlighting', 'real-estate', 'broker', 'who', 'desperate', 'sell', 'house', 'just', 'pay', 'off', 'mortgage', 'alimony', 'payments', 'partner', 'much', 'younger', 'K.C', 'Calden', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'also', 'yoga', 'instructor/aspiring', 'actor', 'latest', 'case', 'murder', 'group', 'rappers', 'hit', 'possibly', 'called', 'producer', 'Antoine', 'Sartain', 'Isaiah', 'Washington', 'attempts', 'solve', 'crime', 'are', 'hindered', 'I.A', 'investigation', 'led', 'Bennie', 'Macko', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'old', 'rival', 'Gavilan', 'who', 'determined', 'make', 'life', 'living', 'hell.For', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'stumbles', 'sputters', 'awkwardly', 'placed', 'jokes', 'involving', 'food', 'orders', 'real', 'estate', 'deals', 'randomness', 'jokes', 'situations', 'improved', 'grew', 'part', 'movie', 'appeal', 'basically', 'focusing', 'two', 'cops', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'pressing', 'concerns', 'minds', 'homicide', 'case', ""'re"", 'matter', 'fact', 'main', 'plot', 'barely', 'given', 'genuine', 'development', 'just', 'there', 'provide', 'movie', 'frame', 'leads', 'can', 'interact', 'get', 'physical', 'action.The', 'movie', 'success', 'mainly', 'leads', 'Ford', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'are', ""n't"", 'typical', 'mis-matched', 'buddy', 'pairing', 'was', 'expecting', 'actually', 'get', 'along', 'pretty', 'well', 'Ford', 'talent', 'comedy', 'not', 'surprise', 'gruff', 'manner', 'deadpan', 'approach', 'perfect', 'material', 'running', 'cell', 'phone', 'real', 'estate', 'gag', 'would', 'normally', 'feel', 'place', 'probably', 'fall', 'flat', 'Ford', 'capbable', 'hands', 'gags', 'are', 'often', 'hilarious', 'Hartnett', 'just', 'right', 'playboy', 'movie', 'star-wannabe', 'not', 'exactly', 'stretch', 'young', 'actor', 'still', 'decent', 'performance.Despite', 'virtually', 'action', 'opening', 'hour', 'movie', 'climaxes', 'twenty-minute', 'non-stop', 'action', 'sequence', 'filled', 'car', 'foot', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'couple', 'scuffles', 'fistfights', 'thrilling', 'segment', 'easily', 'movie', 'highlight', 'are', 'several', 'memorable', 'comic', 'setpieces', 'chase', 'involving', 'paddleboat', 'I.A', 'interrogation', 'constantly', 'interrupted', 'cell', 'phone', 'Ford', 'chasing', 'villain', 'girl', 'bike', 'actually', 'favorite', 'scene', 'whole', 'film', 'Hartnett', 'commandeering', 'SUV', 'family', 'passengers', 'still', 'inside', 'bloodied', 'Ford', 'brandishing', 'gun', 'making', 'finishing', 'touches', 'real', 'estate', 'deal', 'elevator', 'full', 'frightened', 'women', 'Incidentally', 'three', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'final', 'half-hour', 'accompanying', 'action', 'sequences.Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'not', 'fair', 'share', 'flaws', 'film', 'one', 'subplot', 'too', 'many', 'mainly', 'Ford', 'underdeveloped', 'romance', 'psychic', 'Lena', 'Holin', 'Hartnett', 'acting', 'goals', 'silly', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'cop', 'was', 'killed', 'line', 'duty', 'cliche', 'storyline', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'excised', 'Gavilan-Macko', 'rivalry', 'lazily', 'resolved', 'more', 'afterthought', 'filmmaker', 'part', 'actual', 'conclusion', 'One', 'scene', 'involving', 'handcuffed', 'prisoner', 'loaded', 'gun', 'just', 'pointless', 'said', 'movie', 'random', 'storylines', 'were', 'part', 'charm', 'little', 'too', 'random.But', 'movie', 'what', 'be', 'buddy-cop', 'comedy', 'where', 'cops', 'actually', 'feel', 'buddies', 'not', 'hot-headed', 'partners', 'always', 'other', 'throats', 'trivial', 'matters', 'approach', 'may', 'be', 'what', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'believe', 'movie', 'feels', 'much', 'way', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'reason']",N/A

769683,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B0000B00KB,Hound Dog,"[0, 0]","Prior to viewing, I hadn't seen any movie with Josh Hartnett before, so, frankly, I didn't know what to expect from him.  Still, I already knew director Ron Shelton writes relatively solid screenplays, and the solid supporting cast (including Lena Olin, Bruce Greenwood, Keith David, and cameos by Lou Diamond Phillips, Smokey Robinson, among a few others) seemed most promising.  With those positives in mind (particularly Harrison Ford's always reliable presence), I gave ""Hollywood Homicide"" a home DVD screening recently on a Saturday night.Here's the premise: two mismatched L.A. homicide cops (Ford & Hartnett) are partners on the gang slaying of a hip-hop rap group amidst a melee in a downtown nightclub.  Ford's character, Joe Gavilan (who is also desperately trying to sell off a lavish monstrosity of a home in the hills in his part-time gig as a real estate agent), also has the burden of covering for his distracted, young partner, who wants to give up police work to become a 'serious' actor.  Meanwhile, the drug-dealing thug (Isaiah Washington's character) who masterminded the multiple-homicide has a corrupt cop on his side (who, conveniently enough, has ties to the death of Hartnett's father, also a cop).  To add a little extra spice to the storyline, another corrupt cop (played by Bruce Greenwood) in Internal Affairs is cracking down on our heroes' outside interests.  Not too original, is it?I simply couldn't believe my eyes as to how terrible this movie really is.  Every conceivable cop movie clich&eacute; is here (the mismatched partners, corrupt cops, Internal Affairs, stupid car chases, vicious drug dealers, etc.), but Shelton's generic script doesn't bring anything new to the table.  Ford (playing a cop for the umpteenth time) clearly looks bored out of his mind, and seems no doubt as tired and haggard as the grizzled character he plays.  Hartnett, as Ford's yoga-loving sidekick, doesn't provide even adequate back-up, since he too knows this movie is simply a contractual obligation and nothing more.All in all, the movie felt completely artificial to me in that none of the performances were remotely plausible (with the exception of Isaiah Washington, who at least redeems himself as the chief villain).  It just seemed like I was watching movie stars acting for the sake of acting vs. seeing them portray the cops and the robbers they want you to believe they are. As an example, the film's worst scene (there are far too many to choose from, mind you) arguably comes at the climax in which Hartnett commandeers a family SUV (complete with Mom and two little kids in the backseat) to prolong a violent chase sequence.  Listening to Hartnett banter with the kids while chasing the bad guys is a painful lesson in bad taste in terms of needlessly endangering innocent lives for a cheap action movie thrill.In the end, here's my suggestion: carefully examine the promo picture on the DVD box.  To me, it was the only honest thing about the movie, because it delivers exactly what you are going to see: a generic buddy cop flick.  Still, from that picture, if you can somehow convince yourself that Ford and Harnett look even remotely interested in selling this movie, then maybe you should give ""Hollywood Homicide"" a chance.  Otherwise, you're definitely better off finding something else to invest your time and money in.Side Note: As for the DVD special features, they are all standard issue, so don't expect anything redeeming in that regard for your potential purchase.",1,Hollywood Homicide (Alias Harrison Ford: What Were You Thinking?),1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,3515,"['Prior', 'viewing', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'so', 'frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Still', 'already', 'knew', 'director', 'Ron', 'Shelton', 'relatively', 'solid', 'screenplays', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Keith', 'David', 'cameos', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'few', 'others', 'seemed', 'most', 'promising', 'positives', 'mind', 'particularly', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'always', 'reliable', 'presence', 'gave', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'home', 'DVD', 'screening', 'recently', 'Saturday', 'premise', 'two', 'mismatched', 'L.A.', 'homicide', 'cops', 'Ford', 'Hartnett', 'are', 'partners', 'gang', 'slaying', 'hip-hop', 'rap', 'group', 'melee', 'downtown', 'nightclub', 'Ford', 'character', 'Joe', 'Gavilan', 'who', 'also', 'desperately', 'trying', 'sell', 'off', 'lavish', 'monstrosity', 'home', 'hills', 'part-time', 'gig', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'also', 'burden', 'covering', 'distracted', 'young', 'partner', 'who', 'give', 'up', 'police', 'work', 'become', ""'serious"", 'actor', 'Meanwhile', 'drug-dealing', 'thug', 'Isaiah', 'Washington', 'character', 'who', 'masterminded', 'multiple-homicide', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'side', 'who', 'conveniently', 'enough', 'ties', 'death', 'Hartnett', 'father', 'also', 'cop', 'add', 'little', 'extra', 'spice', 'storyline', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'cracking', 'down', 'heroes', 'outside', 'interests', 'Not', 'too', 'original', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'eyes', 'how', 'terrible', 'movie', 'really', 'Every', 'conceivable', 'cop', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'here', 'mismatched', 'partners', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'stupid', 'car', 'chases', 'vicious', 'drug', 'dealers', 'etc', 'Shelton', 'generic', 'script', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'table', 'Ford', 'playing', 'cop', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'clearly', 'bored', 'mind', 'doubt', 'tired', 'haggard', 'grizzled', 'character', 'Hartnett', 'Ford', 'yoga-loving', 'sidekick', ""n't"", 'provide', 'even', 'adequate', 'back-up', 'too', 'movie', 'simply', 'contractual', 'obligation', 'nothing', 'more.All', 'movie', 'felt', 'completely', 'artificial', 'none', 'performances', 'were', 'remotely', 'plausible', 'exception', 'Isaiah', 'Washington', 'who', 'least', 'redeems', 'chief', 'villain', 'just', 'seemed', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'stars', 'acting', 'sake', 'acting', 'vs.', 'seeing', 'portray', 'cops', 'robbers', 'want', 'believe', 'are', 'example', 'film', 'worst', 'scene', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'choose', 'arguably', 'climax', 'Hartnett', 'family', 'SUV', 'complete', 'Mom', 'two', 'little', 'kids', 'backseat', 'prolong', 'violent', 'chase', 'sequence', 'Listening', 'Hartnett', 'banter', 'kids', 'chasing', 'bad', 'guys', 'painful', 'lesson', 'bad', 'taste', 'terms', 'needlessly', 'endangering', 'innocent', 'lives', 'cheap', 'action', 'movie', 'end', 'here', 'suggestion', 'carefully', 'examine', 'promo', 'picture', 'DVD', 'box', 'was', 'only', 'honest', 'thing', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'generic', 'buddy', 'cop', 'flick', 'Still', 'picture', 'can', 'somehow', 'convince', 'Ford', 'Harnett', 'look', 'even', 'remotely', 'interested', 'selling', 'movie', 'then', 'maybe', 'should', 'give', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'chance', 'Otherwise', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'better', 'off', 'finding', 'something', 'else', 'invest', 'time', 'money', 'in.Side', 'Note', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'standard', 'issue', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'redeeming', 'regard', 'potential', 'purchase']",N/A

Two cops, Joe Gavilan, a veteran detective of the LAPD, and his newly assigned partner K. C. Calden, somewhat of a rookie at the job, find themselves thrust in the midst of a high profile investigation involving the murder of an up and coming hip-hop band.  Yet instead of focusing on fleshing out the main story of the movie, the writers decide to throw in several other subplots, and the result is a convoluted mess that is dull as it is unbelievable.  First of all, every character is conveniently connected to each other through ex-girlfriend, old grudges or some previous associations.  Then there is the second profession in which both of the leading characters have taken: Gavilan dabbles in selling real estate while Calden teaches yoga and dreams of being an actor.  The running gag of Gavilan's cell phone ringing non-stop as he goes through the day, looking for a break in his big case, is tiresome and annoying.  Don't get me started on the hokey internal affairs inquiry into Gavilan and his finances, it is poorly conceived, unnecessary, and absolutely ridiculous.Another of the most glaring problems to Hollywood Homicide is that neither Harrison Ford nor Josh Hartnett is known as comedic actors, so one would think that their charisma alone should be enough for the buddy cop formula to work.  Suffice to say I was very disappointed, there was no chemistry between them to speak of.  Ford's portrayal of Gavilan is embarrassingly awful, that not since his role of Quinn Harris in Six Days Seven Nights have I been so bored by his performance.  Hartnett's Calden is equally a disaster, lacking all the gusto he had in Black Hawk Down, which makes me question all over again what is everybody seeing in him beyond the pretty boy look.  The supporting cast is unforgivably underused in bit parts that are uninteresting and badly written.Had Hollywood Homicide been a satire about the police force, maybe I would have had more of an appreciation for the movie.  Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case here.  Thus we were left with two individuals that want nothing to do with being cops, and since they disliked the job so much, you can well imagine how painful it was for the audiences to watch them doing something they are really terrible in.  However, the aforementioned problem could have been overlooked if the film at least gave us some action to distract us from the paper-thin characters, but somehow it managed to botch the attempt.  The only action scene to speak of came at the last twenty minutes of the picture, and the chase sequence was shoddily edited as well as anticlimactic.  In the end, Hollywood Homicide was a bore and a chore of an experience.  It is neither funny nor exciting, and there is almost no redeeming quality to the movie, what a waste of a talented cast.",2,"It doesn't get any worse than this, what a disappointment",1055289600,"06 11, 2003",2003,2885,"['premise', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'first', 'Two', 'cops', 'Joe', 'Gavilan', 'veteran', 'detective', 'LAPD', 'newly', 'assigned', 'partner', 'K.', 'C.', 'Calden', 'somewhat', 'rookie', 'job', 'find', 'thrust', 'midst', 'high', 'profile', 'investigation', 'involving', 'murder', 'up', 'coming', 'hip-hop', 'band', 'instead', 'focusing', 'fleshing', 'out', 'main', 'story', 'movie', 'writers', 'decide', 'throw', 'several', 'other', 'subplots', 'result', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'dull', 'unbelievable', 'First', 'all', 'character', 'conveniently', 'connected', 'other', 'ex-girlfriend', 'old', 'grudges', 'previous', 'associations', 'Then', 'second', 'profession', 'leading', 'characters', 'have', 'taken', 'Gavilan', 'dabbles', 'selling', 'real', 'estate', 'Calden', 'teaches', 'yoga', 'dreams', 'being', 'actor', 'running', 'gag', 'Gavilan', 'cell', 'phone', 'ringing', 'non-stop', 'day', 'looking', 'break', 'big', 'case', 'tiresome', 'annoying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'hokey', 'internal', 'affairs', 'inquiry', 'Gavilan', 'finances', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'unnecessary', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous.Another', 'most', 'glaring', 'problems', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'known', 'comedic', 'actors', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'charisma', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'buddy', 'cop', 'formula', 'work', 'Suffice', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'was', 'chemistry', 'speak', 'Ford', 'portrayal', 'Gavilan', 'embarrassingly', 'awful', 'not', 'role', 'Quinn', 'Harris', 'Six', 'Days', 'Seven', 'Nights', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'bored', 'performance', 'Hartnett', 'Calden', 'equally', 'disaster', 'lacking', 'gusto', 'had', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'question', 'over', 'again', 'what', 'everybody', 'seeing', 'pretty', 'boy', 'look', 'supporting', 'cast', 'unforgivably', 'underused', 'bit', 'parts', 'are', 'uninteresting', 'badly', 'written.Had', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'been', 'satire', 'police', 'force', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'appreciation', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'Thus', 'were', 'left', 'two', 'individuals', 'want', 'nothing', 'do', 'being', 'cops', 'disliked', 'job', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'well', 'imagine', 'how', 'painful', 'was', 'audiences', 'watch', 'doing', 'something', 'are', 'really', 'terrible', 'However', 'aforementioned', 'problem', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'film', 'least', 'gave', 'action', 'distract', 'paper-thin', 'characters', 'somehow', 'managed', 'botch', 'attempt', 'only', 'action', 'scene', 'speak', 'came', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'picture', 'chase', 'sequence', 'was', 'shoddily', 'edited', 'as', 'well', 'anticlimactic', 'end', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'was', 'bore', 'chore', 'experience', 'funny', 'exciting', 'almost', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'movie', 'what', 'waste', 'talented', 'cast']",N/A

The premise is that there is some rappers are murdered in a nightclub.  Two detectives investigate the murders and find that it isn't a straight forward murder, but rather something that has deeper implications towards a music label and perhaps the police force itself.  Joe (Harrison Ford) is the older cop who sells real estate on the side (and sometimes on the job).  He is paired with K.C. (Josh Harnett), a young detective who is also a yoga instructor and an aspiring actor.  Somehow all of this is brought together, but it really doesn't matter.The movie is a comedy.  Director Ron Shelton can direct comedy, he has done so in the past with Bull Durham and Tin Cup (these were slightly more serious comedies).  This movie was supposed to be funny.  You can see some scenes working very hard for a laugh.  It's just not funny.  It is dull, uninteresting and I believe the last half hour of the movie was one long chase sequence.  There are supporting performances and cameos from Master P, Gladys Knight, Lena Olin, Bruce Greenwood, Isaiah Washington, Lolita Davidovich, Dwight Yoakam, Lou Diamond Philips, and Martin Landau.

The movie's big innovation is that Ford moonlights as a realtor while Hartnett is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor, and they are far more passionate about their respective side jobs than being cops (at least the movie makes it appear that way at first). As the action progresses, Ford becomes enmeshed in a plan to negotiate a house sale between two of the principle witnesses, which leads to some pretty good jokes. There's also an ongoing joke that Ford is getting too old to physically run down the suspects, and his heavy breathing after an attempt is pretty funny, if only because so many other movies in the genre ignore that kind of thing. But the humor is limited to too few springboards, while the action is so standard that it might as well not even be there. Ditto the plot, which is a total paint-by-numbers good guys versus bad guys clich&eacute;. In the end, Hartnett decides to stick with the force, as he has taken a renewed pleasure in fighting for justice. The direction had some nice moments, and a surprisingly gritty feel for such a goofy innovation; the script had some good zingers in keeping with convention.

I can just imagine the pitch, ""okay for starters we've got eye candy for women of all ages (Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett), a multiple murder, feuding hip hop musicians, corrupt recording moguls, a cop with money problems, a young stud struggling to avenge his father's murder, an Internal Affairs guy with a grudge, a high class madam, characters that can pull a script out of their pocket at the mere mention of the word `producer', AND a psychic girlfriend, how can it fail?""  Perhaps the filmmakers should have asked a few other questions first.  Is it a comedy?  A buddy/action picture?  A cop drama with some lighthearted moments?  Sad to say, the result of all this is a barely watchable mishmash of nonsenseThe basic plot (and I'm being generous to call it that) has two detectives trying to balance police work and supplementary careers.  Ford is a homicide detective who also sells real estate.  Hartnett isn't just content being a detective and babe magnet yoga instructor, he's also a wannabe actor.  Do you really want to know more?  How about the hero trying to negotiate a home sale over the phone while he's involved in the climactic chase with the bad guys?Were it not for Ford's easygoing performance, this would have been a straight to video release that would languish on the shelves between Ishtar and Rockie 5.  And sadly, the talents of able actors like Martin Landau, Lena Olin and Lolita Davidovich get wasted in minor cartoonish roles, along with a nice cameo by Gladys Knight (sans Pips).  Mr. Hartnett manages to speak most of his lines clearly.Just to add insult to injury, the movie begins with the classic continuity error of having a character in a sunny daylight setting turn up only ten ""plot minutes"" later in a rainy nighttime scene; then they bookend that faux pas nicely by moving the guys directly from a downtown evening gathering to a sunlit crime scene in the hills.",2,This movie has an identity problem!,1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,2023,"['producers', 'just', 'drew', 'clich', 'eacute', 'hat', 'then', 'tried', 'make', 'movie', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'pitch', 'okay', 'starters', ""'ve"", 'got', 'eye', 'candy', 'women', 'ages', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'multiple', 'murder', 'feuding', 'hip', 'hop', 'musicians', 'corrupt', 'recording', 'moguls', 'cop', 'money', 'problems', 'young', 'stud', 'struggling', 'avenge', 'father', 'murder', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'guy', 'grudge', 'high', 'class', 'madam', 'characters', 'can', 'pull', 'script', 'pocket', 'mere', 'mention', 'word', 'producer', 'psychic', 'girlfriend', 'how', 'can', 'fail', 'Perhaps', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'have', 'asked', 'few', 'other', 'questions', 'first', 'comedy', 'buddy/action', 'picture', 'cop', 'drama', 'lighthearted', 'moments', 'Sad', 'say', 'result', 'barely', 'watchable', 'mishmash', 'nonsenseThe', 'basic', 'plot', ""'m"", 'being', 'generous', 'call', 'two', 'detectives', 'trying', 'balance', 'police', 'work', 'supplementary', 'careers', 'Ford', 'homicide', 'detective', 'who', 'also', 'real', 'estate', 'Hartnett', ""n't"", 'just', 'content', 'being', 'detective', 'babe', 'magnet', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'also', 'wannabe', 'actor', 'Do', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'How', 'hero', 'trying', 'negotiate', 'home', 'sale', 'phone', 'involved', 'climactic', 'chase', 'bad', 'guys', 'Were', 'not', 'Ford', 'easygoing', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'straight', 'video', 'release', 'would', 'languish', 'shelves', 'Ishtar', 'Rockie', '5', 'sadly', 'talents', 'able', 'actors', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Lolita', 'Davidovich', 'get', 'wasted', 'minor', 'cartoonish', 'roles', 'nice', 'cameo', 'Gladys', 'Knight', 'sans', 'Pips', 'Mr.', 'Hartnett', 'speak', 'most', 'lines', 'clearly.Just', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'movie', 'classic', 'continuity', 'error', 'having', 'character', 'sunny', 'daylight', 'setting', 'turn', 'up', 'only', 'ten', 'plot', 'minutes', 'later', 'rainy', 'nighttime', 'scene', 'then', 'bookend', 'faux', 'pas', 'nicely', 'moving', 'guys', 'directly', 'downtown', 'evening', 'gathering', 'sunlit', 'crime', 'scene', 'hills']",N/A

K.C. Calden (Josh Hartnett), Joe's  young partner of 4 months, makes extra cash as a yoga instructor but really wants to be an actor. When three members of an up-and-coming rap group are murdered at a night club in an apparent assassination, Joe and K.C. are assigned to the case. What looks at first to be a  gang shooting appears more sinister and complex as their investigation progresses. Meanwhile, the partners are dogged by an Internal Affairs investigation of Joe, which has been instigated by an old rival, Lt. Macko (Bruce Greenwood), whose motivations are suspect.For &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot;, director Ron Shelton teamed up with writer and veteran L.A. police officer Robert Souza to make a movie that shows the audience some of the realities behind the badge of L.A. police officers. &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; concentrates on the fact that many L.A. police officers have second jobs which at times may conflict with their duties and exploits this conflict to comic effect. &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; gives a strong impression of police detectives trying to do two jobs at once. In fact, Joe and K.C. so often have their minds on something else that they seem unprofessional, and you may wonder when they have time to consider the murder investigation at hand. The film's saving grace is that it is so relentless in showing us characters that are thinking about one thing while doing another -Joe selling real estate while pursuing a suspect, K.C. promoting his play everywhere, musicians who want to be screenwriters, groupies who want to be actors- that it eventually becomes laugh-out-loud funny. This is also one of those films that couldn't have been made in an era before cell phones. They chime constantly, but that just becomes annoying. Everything in &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot;, with the exception of the murders, is played for comic effect: chase scenes, the Internal Affairs investigation, the multiple jobs and lofty aspirations. Sometimes it gets bogged down in banter, but the film gets funnier as it goes along. Recommended to those seeking mildly amusing light entertainment.The DVD: My hat is off to this DVD for including the widescreen and full screen versions on the same disc. Bonus features include a director's commentary, filmographies (just lists) for director Ron Shelton, writer Robert Souza, and the two principal actors, and theatrical trailers.

The movie follows two homicide detectives investigating some murders within the rap music industry.Both of the detectives have their little quirks.  The younger of the pair is a part-time yoga instructor and wannabe actor whose cop father was killed in the line of duty.  The killer was never caught, but of course, his current investigation will solve this crime as well.  The elder partner is a part-time real estate agent with a girlfriend who is a radio psychic.  There are the requisite number of chase scenes and shoot-outs; the characters must deal with internal affairs and are given a certain time limit to solve the crime.  Fortunately, even if they don't have any actual evidence, the bad guys will at least start shooting and incriminating themselves.Ron Shelton has somehow become a big name screenwriter, but you would never know why from this movie.  The story seems like it was generated on a computer; just fill in a couple blanks and the film writes itself.

It is somewhere between a cop buddy parody movie and a love fest for the two co-stars who like to do nothing more than make money on the side (In more ways than one) through legit second jobs like teaching yoga and selling houses as a real estate agent. This is more akin to an episode of Sex in the City. Forget about the homicide in the title. It is something that doesn't motivate you in the least. You don't even pay any attention to it for that. I have forgotten what it is? Something about a rap record producer assassinating people with a hit-man who just happens to have connections with Harnett's dead dad. So why did I watch it? It reminds me of Showtime from DeNiro or Pluto Nash or I Spy or something like one of these really silly Eddy Murphy flicks. Yeah - like that. So is this the kind of material that deserves to be called Ford's greatest turkey? Probably yeah, it is actually. So here it is for the bottom of his pile. It's rubbish. It is Ford not going well at his trademark Ford funny&trade;. Hartnett probably just passes as the token kid but hams it up considerably.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","Despite some mighty impressive competition for the title, ""Hollywood Homicide"" clearly wins the award for the most enervating and lackluster major studio comedy of 2003.  It isn't that the filmmakers have tried and failed in their endeavor (which one could at least respect); it's that they seem not to have tried at all that is the real offense here.  Robert Souza and Ron Shelton (who also directed the film) have provided a screenplay so lacking in energy and forward momentum that the film seems to be evaporating even as you're watching it.Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett play cop buddies assigned to the Hollywood precinct of the LAPD.  Since these two fine actors have been given virtually nothing to work with in terms of either comedy or drama, Ford and Hartnett are left to underplay almost to the point of catatonia.  In fact, the whole film is suffering from a major case of inertia with Shelton clearly unable to execute even the most rudimentary elements for an effective police procedural.  The crime drama he's provided - something about murders that occur at a local nightclub - is so bland and uninteresting that the actors are left with absolutely nothing to play off of except their own sweet likeability.  And indeed, Ford and Hartnett wander aimlessly through every scene, getting off a few half-hearted quips every now and then to remind us that what we are seeing is supposed to be a sharp-edged satire on cop buddy movies.  Since nothing that happens is remotely exciting or amusing, the movie earns the rare distinction of failing in two different genres, tanking both as a comedy and as a drama.  That's quite an accomplishment for any film, I would say.Hopefully, Ford and Hartnett have already moved onto better things in their moviemaking careers.

769718,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0000B00KB,Samuel McKewon,"[4, 6]","""Hollywood Homicide"" is wit and sarcasm chugging on fumes, the first film Ron Shelton has ever written or directed that's lame on arrival -- even his last full writing/directing effort, ""Play It To The Bone,"" had its moments of machismo goofiness. This time, the former sportswriter of ""Bull Durham"" and ""Blaze"" has strayed too far from his comfort zone and tried to craft a kind of Robert Altman-lite LA story of intersecting lives and Tinseltown truisms. Aside from star Harrison Ford's droll lead, which exists apart from the tangled freeway of plots and subplots, ""Hollywood Homicide"" fails in just about every way imaginable.Ford is Joe Gavilan, a past-his-prime homicide investigator up to his salt-and-pepper shag in alimony payments to three ex-wives. Gavilan moonlights as a real estate agent; he's desperately trying to unload a house on Mt. Olympus while sparking a romance with a psychic (Lena Olin). Gavilan's partner is KC Calden (Josh Hartnett), a shaggy dog of a younger generation, who yearns, in the year's most unoriginal plot twist, to be an actor. Granted, that acting is such an unoriginal aspiration is part of Shelton's point, but satires of clich&eacute;s aren't particularly original either. Calden's character is a double whammy.But at least Hartnett plays a role. Shelton unwisely builds a giant bandwagon for his film for a series of walk-on ""color"" cameos that smash whatever driving narrative the movie could've hoped for. There's a cop in drag (Lou Diamond Phillips), a madam (Lolita Davidovich, a Shelton regular), an Internal Affairs cop (Bruce Greenwood, badly needing another JFK or Atom Egoyan role), the always-dependable Keith David as the ""Sarge,"" Olin's psychic and Gladys Knight in a reasonable cameo as a former backup singer. And then there's Martin Landau in another worthless, call-it-in role that Martin Landau specializes in while he waits for another Academy Award nomination to fall his way. Landau, in this movie, is pretty much an embarrassment.The ""homicide"" element of the plot is an afterthought -- four promising rappers are gunned down in a nightclub; unwisely, we're shown the villains, a record producer (Isisah Washington) and an ex-cop (Dwight Yoakam), well before the cops even investigate them, and a full hour before the Gavilan and Calden track down the key witness after an endless chase through the manure-filled waterways of Venice. Suspense is substituted for scenes of Davidovich making veiled threats and the ever-popular handcuffed-suspect-gets-the-cop-gun set piece in a parking lot.The rest of ""Hollywood Homicide"" is a recycled farce -- trash borrowed from the excise bins on better cop movies, as if Shelton owned the rights to every discarded and misguided stereotype and plotline ever conceived.Harrison Ford's movies have taken a beaten lately, critically and financially, but he still brings that Harrisonian aura to a picture; Ford's act is weathered and respectable -- he inches closer to that John Huston role in ""Chinatown"" with every job -- and Gavilan, as a guy who's had it up to here but expecting a little more, fits him nicely. Not quite so with Hartnett, painfully unconvincing with a badge -- there's fish out of water cases, and then there's KC Calden, who displays the crime-fighting capabilities of a high school security guard. The career he seems most fit for, yoga instructor, is merely his third calling in Shelton's grand opera.Shelton is a skilled enough writer of the male ego that ""Hollywood Homicide"" does not unravel without a few laughs, but his murder plot is shockingly empty, and the movie's climactic chase, -- as long, if not longer, than ""The Matrix Reloaded"" wowser -- is simply too unbelievable to endure. The movie stumbles and bumbles to the finish line at well over two hours and immediately signs its card as a contender for worst summer movie of 2003.",2,As slow as a day in LA traffic.,1065052800,"10 2, 2003",2003,3870,"['Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'chugging', 'fumes', 'first', 'film', 'Ron', 'Shelton', 'ever', 'written', 'directed', 'lame', 'arrival', 'even', 'last', 'full', 'writing/directing', 'effort', 'Play', 'Bone', 'had', 'moments', 'machismo', 'goofiness', 'time', 'former', 'sportswriter', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'Blaze', 'strayed', 'too', 'far', 'comfort', 'zone', 'tried', 'craft', 'kind', 'Robert', 'Altman-lite', 'LA', 'story', 'intersecting', 'lives', 'Tinseltown', 'truisms', 'Aside', 'star', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'droll', 'lead', 'apart', 'tangled', 'freeway', 'plots', 'subplots', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'just', 'way', 'imaginable.Ford', 'Joe', 'Gavilan', 'past-his-prime', 'homicide', 'investigator', 'salt-and-pepper', 'shag', 'alimony', 'payments', 'three', 'ex-wives', 'Gavilan', 'moonlights', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'desperately', 'trying', 'unload', 'house', 'Mt', 'Olympus', 'sparking', 'romance', 'psychic', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Gavilan', 'partner', 'KC', 'Calden', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'younger', 'generation', 'who', 'year', 'most', 'unoriginal', 'plot', 'twist', 'be', 'actor', 'Granted', 'acting', 'such', 'unoriginal', 'aspiration', 'part', 'Shelton', 'point', 'satires', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'original', 'Calden', 'character', 'double', 'whammy.But', 'least', 'Hartnett', 'role', 'Shelton', 'unwisely', 'giant', 'bandwagon', 'film', 'series', 'walk-on', 'color', 'cameos', 'driving', 'narrative', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'hoped', 'cop', 'drag', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'madam', 'Lolita', 'Davidovich', 'Shelton', 'regular', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'cop', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'badly', 'needing', 'JFK', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'role', 'always-dependable', 'Keith', 'David', 'Sarge', 'Olin', 'psychic', 'Gladys', 'Knight', 'reasonable', 'cameo', 'former', 'backup', 'singer', 'then', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'worthless', 'call-it-in', 'role', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'fall', 'way', 'Landau', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'embarrassment.The', 'homicide', 'element', 'plot', 'afterthought', 'four', 'promising', 'rappers', 'are', 'gunned', 'down', 'nightclub', 'unwisely', ""'re"", 'shown', 'villains', 'record', 'producer', 'Isisah', 'Washington', 'ex-cop', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'well', 'cops', 'even', 'investigate', 'full', 'hour', 'Gavilan', 'Calden', 'track', 'down', 'key', 'witness', 'endless', 'chase', 'manure-filled', 'waterways', 'Venice', 'Suspense', 'substituted', 'scenes', 'Davidovich', 'making', 'veiled', 'threats', 'ever-popular', 'handcuffed-suspect-gets-the-cop-gun', 'set', 'piece', 'parking', 'lot.The', 'rest', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'recycled', 'farce', 'trash', 'borrowed', 'excise', 'better', 'cop', 'movies', 'Shelton', 'owned', 'rights', 'discarded', 'misguided', 'stereotype', 'plotline', 'ever', 'Ford', 'movies', 'have', 'taken', 'beaten', 'lately', 'critically', 'financially', 'still', 'Harrisonian', 'aura', 'picture', 'Ford', 'act', 'weathered', 'respectable', 'closer', 'John', 'Huston', 'role', 'Chinatown', 'job', 'Gavilan', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'up', 'here', 'expecting', 'little', 'more', 'nicely', 'Not', 'quite', 'so', 'Hartnett', 'painfully', 'unconvincing', 'badge', 'fish', 'water', 'cases', 'then', 'KC', 'Calden', 'who', 'crime-fighting', 'capabilities', 'high', 'school', 'security', 'guard', 'career', 'most', 'fit', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'merely', 'third', 'calling', 'Shelton', 'grand', 'opera.Shelton', 'skilled', 'enough', 'writer', 'male', 'ego', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'not', 'unravel', 'few', 'laughs', 'murder', 'plot', 'shockingly', 'empty', 'movie', 'climactic', 'chase', 'long', 'not', 'longer', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'wowser', 'simply', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'endure', 'movie', 'stumbles', 'bumbles', 'finish', 'line', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'immediately', 'signs', 'card', 'contender', 'worst', 'summer', 'movie', '2003']",N/A

Yet, no, don't go in expecting a nailbiting police procedural.The film is strewn with several cliches but I fail to see why reviewers tend to compare it to &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; and &quot;Rush Hour.&quot; The partners are not mismatched, not constantly annoying each other , and it is filled with interesting characters that make up for the generic storytelling.Ford's character for instance moonlights as a real-estate agent who, despite not having sold a house in some time, dabbles in the business because being a cop can't pay the bills. Hartnetts character takes yoga lessons, in the process meeting women. This makes even the most generic scenes seem fresh and new.So, when watching an otherwise predictable car chase, you will find yourself worrying more about the characters reactions than the actual car chase itself. This is a film that relies more on characters than action and eye-candy. You will probably wear a slight grin on your face when Hartnett re-enacts &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; on the balcony of a Beverly Hills condo, or when Ford closes a real estate deal on his cell phone in the middle of an intense gunfight.Yes, the story is stale, but the characters are not, and that is probably the point. &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; puts itself a step above other cop films by offering characters (or caricatures thereof) that we can actually care for.",3,"NOT REALLY A COMEDY, BUT A LIGHT-HEARTED ROMP THRU COP LIFE",1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,1508,"['Harrison', 'ford', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'play', 'homicide', 'detectives', 'investigating', 'quadruple', 'murder', 'up-and-coming', 'rap', 'group', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'nailbiting', 'police', 'procedural.The', 'film', 'strewn', 'several', 'cliches', 'fail', 'see', 'why', 'reviewers', 'tend', 'compare', 'quot', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rush', 'Hour.', 'quot', 'partners', 'are', 'not', 'mismatched', 'not', 'constantly', 'annoying', 'other', 'filled', 'interesting', 'characters', 'make', 'up', 'generic', 'storytelling.Ford', 'character', 'instance', 'moonlights', 'real-estate', 'agent', 'who', 'not', 'having', 'sold', 'house', 'time', 'dabbles', 'business', 'being', 'cop', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'bills', 'Hartnetts', 'character', 'yoga', 'lessons', 'process', 'meeting', 'women', 'even', 'most', 'generic', 'scenes', 'seem', 'fresh', 'new.So', 'when', 'watching', 'otherwise', 'predictable', 'car', 'chase', 'will', 'find', 'worrying', 'more', 'characters', 'reactions', 'actual', 'car', 'chase', 'film', 'more', 'characters', 'action', 'eye-candy', 'will', 'probably', 'wear', 'slight', 'grin', 'face', 'when', 'Hartnett', 'quot', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'quot', 'balcony', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'condo', 'when', 'Ford', 'real', 'estate', 'deal', 'cell', 'phone', 'middle', 'intense', 'gunfight.Yes', 'story', 'stale', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'probably', 'point', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', 'quot', 'step', 'other', 'cop', 'films', 'offering', 'characters', 'thereof', 'can', 'actually', 'care']",N/A

I really like seeing that feature, and wish more movies gave that option.In this flop of a buddy cop comedy Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) is a cop who is more into his real estate business and K C Calden (Josh Harnett) is his younger partner who would rather teach yoga classes and flirt with the yoga students in his class.  Calden is also a wannabe actor.  The movie begins with the murders an up and coming rap group H20 Click (hip hop artist Choppa one of the members lip synching terribly).  During the investigation all clues lead to recording executive Antoine Sartain (Isaiah Washington- True Crime, Ghost Ship, Soul Food Series Season 1).  In an even bigger twist (if you can even call it that) the former partner of Calden's father, Leroy Wasley is in charge of Sartain's security.  The actual police case that the film is supposed to be investigating takes a back seat to their second jobs.  In fact you are so irritated by the constant ringing of Harrison's cell phone you forget what this lousy movie is about in the first place.  The rest of the movies is spent solving the case and Gavilan trying to sell the house that could give him a huge commission.  Gavilan can't sell to save his life!!!  Calden is seen rehearsing for a Street Car Named Desire.  All I wanted to do was scream at my TV ""Stick to being a cop and yoga instructor!!!!!!""  The funniest part of the film was the K-Ro (Kurupt) chase scene.  Kurupt had me laughing with the way he was running, and the crazy things he said, and did.  Aside of that I had to struggle to watch this disaster of a film.  Hollywood Homicide pretty much could describe the careers of anyone who starred in this flop.  Will someone please inform Hollywood putting some rappers in movies is not going to guarantee a hit.  All rappers can't act, so stop putting Master P in movies!!!!!! UuuugggggghhhhhhhhhGladys Knight has a small role as mother to K-Ro.  Lou Diamond Phillips has a role as a male hooker undercover cop;  Martin Landau as a has been director; Smokey Robinson as a cab driver; let's just say all the cameos in the world could not save this pathetic movie!!!The only reason I'm giving this movie a two rating is because of the Kurupt chase scene.  I'm so happy I borrowed this from my local library, and did not spend my hard earned money to rent this.  This movie is supposed to be a comedy, but trust me, you won't find yourself laughing.  I'm usually a huge fan of Ford's, but this is one movie I would not watch again.  I guess every actor has to have that one movie on their resume that they did just to collect a check.  This sorry flop is Harrison's.  The chemistry between the two ""buddy cops"" seemed very forced.The best Buddy cop movie will always be Lethal Weapon, with Rush Hour coming in second.

And throw some humor (of sort) in between the actions, plus the cameo appearances.  Then you get &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; which is, I frankly say, a total misfire case of how not to make a film.The story is about two cops Harrison Hord and Josh Hartnett, whose main concern seems to lie not in arresting the criminals.  They both have some part-time job (real estate agent and yoga instructor), which are more lucrative than police jobs (now, the script is provided by Robert Souza, ex-police officer in homicide division, so I do not question this part).And one hip-hop group are gunned down (reminding us of some real-life incidents), and the case throws the pair into the investigation behind the music business.  But of course, you see many twists and turns of the story ... which are so many that I started to lose interest.  Probably you will, too.The problem is twofold; the film has too many sub-plots, which only detract our attention.  The actions happen, but it is not easy to tell who is who (or who is not who).  The film seems to mock the trend in Hollywood celebrities by introducing yoga or fortune telling, but this part just makes us feel &quot;So what?&quot;The other problem is its misguided humors.  Harrison Ford is guilty of being too comical, but it just does not work.  The idea of his riding a bicycle when chasing a bad guy looks funny if the cop is played by actors like Jackie Chan, whose down-to-earth character makes the situation natural.  In Harrison, whose best remembered role is still Indiana Jones, it is simply embarrasing and impossible.Slightly interesting is the film's cameo.  There are so many of them -- Eric Idle, Robert Wagner, Lou Diamond Philips, Frank Sinatra Jr., Gladys Knight, and even Smoky Robinson  but few are effective.  Perhaps, some of them refer to the famous cases involving celebrities (British Eric Idle arrestd or Philips in women's dress, both of which remind us of the two real-life incidents),  Whatever they are, these brief cameo appearances are amusing for about ... ten seconds.Maybe, as the title suggest, the greatest thing about the film is its location -- Hollywood.  You can see many famous places of the Tinseltown, plus an unexpected glimpse of Venice Canals.  And compared with the fine locale, the film's actors (including Lolita Davidovich, wife to the director Ron Shelton) are all boring.

HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE has some action and is full of comedy, and it's mostly a buddy-flick. However, it's not an action-comedy buddy flick. Instead it's a dramatic-comedy buddy flick.Harrison Ford plays a Hollywood detective who also has a second job as a real estate agent. Josh Harnett plays his partner who also has a second job on the side as an yoga instructor, but what he really wants to be is an actor. The duo gets involved in a case involving some singer murdered at a local club. Along the way, there are all sorts of comical interchanges, some more hilarious than the Keystone Cops.I had heard a lot of negative things about this movie before watching it, so I watched it rather reluctantly. However, I was quite surprised. Granted, the film doesn't fit into a typical drama and the plot isn't that original. However, it really does work and work well.I think there are two reasons this film has been undeservedly panned. First of all, the villains really aren't much of bad guys and are more like villains taken from an animated flick and blown up into a real person. Ford and Harnett's characters and many of those around them are fleshed out. However, the villains, who are so central to the plot, come off as being nothing more than cardboard cut-out bad guys. Had they been a little more interesting, then I think people would have enjoyed the movie more.The other main reason I think the movie has gotten negative reviews is that the film was advertised as a action-comedy, but it's not an action-comedy. It's more of a dramatic-comedy with a little action inner-twined. Of course, the film also takes place in Hollywood and perhaps it reminded people of how much they loath what goes on in Tinsletown.Anyway, HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE is an underrated gem. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you have a quirky sense of humor and enjoy a comedy filled with drama and a little action, then you probably will enjoy it.",4,Different,1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,2111,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'full', 'action', 'inner-spaced', 'little', 'comedy', 'basically', 'buddy', 'flick', 'then', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'HOMICIDE', 'not', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'HOMICIDE', 'action', 'full', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'buddy-flick', 'However', 'not', 'action-comedy', 'buddy', 'flick', 'Instead', 'dramatic-comedy', 'buddy', 'flick.Harrison', 'Ford', 'Hollywood', 'detective', 'who', 'also', 'second', 'job', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'Josh', 'Harnett', 'partner', 'who', 'also', 'second', 'job', 'side', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'actor', 'duo', 'involved', 'case', 'involving', 'singer', 'murdered', 'local', 'club', 'way', 'are', 'sorts', 'comical', 'interchanges', 'more', 'hilarious', 'Keystone', 'Cops.I', 'had', 'heard', 'lot', 'negative', 'things', 'movie', 'watching', 'so', 'watched', 'rather', 'reluctantly', 'However', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'Granted', 'film', ""n't"", 'fit', 'typical', 'drama', 'plot', ""n't"", 'original', 'However', 'really', 'work', 'work', 'well.I', 'think', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'film', 'been', 'undeservedly', 'panned', 'First', 'all', 'villains', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'more', 'villains', 'taken', 'animated', 'flick', 'blown', 'up', 'real', 'person', 'Ford', 'Harnett', 'characters', 'many', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'However', 'villains', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'central', 'plot', 'come', 'off', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'bad', 'guys', 'Had', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'then', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'other', 'main', 'reason', 'think', 'movie', 'gotten', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'was', 'advertised', 'action-comedy', 'not', 'action-comedy', 'more', 'dramatic-comedy', 'little', 'action', 'inner-twined', 'course', 'film', 'also', 'place', 'Hollywood', 'perhaps', 'reminded', 'people', 'how', 'much', 'loath', 'what', 'Tinsletown.Anyway', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'HOMICIDE', 'underrated', 'gem', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'have', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'filled', 'drama', 'little', 'action', 'then', 'probably', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A
