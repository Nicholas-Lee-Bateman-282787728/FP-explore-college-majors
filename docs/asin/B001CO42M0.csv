Sunday School Musical(2008) was harmless fun. It's not perfect. A musical number with Zack starts and then nothing happens! The Christian themes are shoehorned into the movie. The film stars...nobody! I am kidding. It stars Chris Chatman and Candise Lakota. It's directed by Rachel Lee Goldenberg. Amy Ganser is ultra cute as Margaret. In Sunday School Musical, two choirs work together to save a church from being closed. Sunday School Musical tries to cash in on the success of Disney's High School Musical movies. Hollywood produced musicals from the 1920's to the 1960's. The genre was almost dead in the 1970's.Only recently has Hollywood movies and TV shows started a renewed interest in the musical genre with TV shows such as Glee. Sunday School Musical is a fun, B grade musical.",3,Sunday School Musical(2008),1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,907,"['Asylum', 'gained', 'bad', 'reputation', 'making', 'low', 'budget', 'duplicates', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'Sunday', 'School', 'Musical', '2008', 'was', 'harmless', 'fun', 'not', 'perfect', 'musical', 'number', 'Zack', 'starts', 'then', 'nothing', 'Christian', 'themes', 'are', 'shoehorned', 'movie', 'film', 'stars', 'nobody', 'am', 'kidding', 'Chris', 'Chatman', 'Candise', 'Lakota', 'directed', 'Rachel', 'Lee', 'Goldenberg', 'Amy', 'Ganser', 'ultra', 'cute', 'Margaret', 'Sunday', 'School', 'Musical', 'two', 'choirs', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'church', 'being', 'closed', 'Sunday', 'School', 'Musical', 'tries', 'cash', 'success', 'Disney', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'produced', 'musicals', '1920', '1960', 'genre', 'was', 'almost', 'dead', ""1970's.Only"", 'recently', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'started', 'renewed', 'interest', 'musical', 'genre', 'TV', 'shows', 'such', 'Glee', 'Sunday', 'School', 'Musical', 'fun', 'B', 'grade', 'musical']",Sunday School Musical

1177010,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001CO42M0,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 8]","Even though it's only a second-rate show with a hodge-podge of key scenes and characters from other shows (GREASE, BYE BYE BIRDIE, etc.), HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL is huge among American pre-teens and teenagers.  I'm not a very big fan of the show because it shows such little originality.  Anyway, with the massive success of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, it was only a matter of time before production companies started spewing out their own versions of the movie in an attempt to cash in on the success.  SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL is one of these.SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL was definitely inspired by HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but instead of taking place in a typical high school is set in a small Christian school. Instead of a New Year's Eve of karaoke, SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL's two stars, Zach (Chris Chatman) and Savannah (Candise Lakota) first meet at a regional church choir competition.  Zach is one of the stars of his choir and his group is chosen to compete in the final competition.  By a fluke, Savannah's group is also selected to compete in the finals. Later Zach's mom gets a new job and they are forced to move. Zach begins attending a new school, which turns out to be the same school where Savannah goes.  Savannah and some of her friends try to get Zach to join the choir, but he refuses because he feels connected to his old choir and doesn't want to compete against his old friends.  But a tragedy befalls Zach's friends and causes everyone to reconsider what is important in their lives and where loyalty should fall.There are one or two songs in SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL that aren't too terrible.  Candise Lakota is beautiful and has the attention of every scene she is in. There is no foul language and no violence.  The movie tries to deliver a message about the importance of using one's gifts regardless if one is rewarded for it.  Those are the good things about the movie.But, SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL is not a very good movie.  It was written, directed, and choreographed by first timers and I try very hard to give first-timers a break.  But if a movie is bad, it's bad.  SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL is bad.  I've seen better acting in middle school skits than most of the acting in the movie.  Most of the songs are covered in cheese and schmaltz and have a beat and vibe that sounds and feels like a Carmen song from the late 1980s or early 1990s. Candise Lakota is gorgeous and is quite talented, but she has zero chemistry with her co-star, Chris Chatman.  HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL is a second-rate musical watered-downed from other musicals, but much of the plot of SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL is watered-downed from HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL; there's barely an ounce of originality in the whole story.I did not enjoy watching SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL. In fact, there were certain parts of it that were painful to watch, especially some of the musical numbers.  There are some people who would enjoy the movie, especially because there's no foul language, violence, or sexual innuendo and has a fluffy-feel-goodness with a happy ending.  But if you actually want to see something that has some originality and creativity, contains decent acting, and attempts to engage the audience, you're better off watching something else.",1,Watered-Down Rip-Off,1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,3202,"['Even', 'only', 'second-rate', 'show', 'hodge-podge', 'key', 'scenes', 'characters', 'other', 'shows', 'GREASE', 'BYE', 'BYE', 'BIRDIE', 'etc', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'huge', 'American', 'pre-teens', 'teenagers', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'such', 'little', 'originality', 'Anyway', 'massive', 'success', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'production', 'companies', 'started', 'spewing', 'out', 'own', 'versions', 'movie', 'attempt', 'cash', 'success', 'SUNDAY', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'one', 'these.SUNDAY', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'was', 'definitely', 'inspired', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'instead', 'taking', 'place', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'set', 'small', 'Christian', 'school', 'Instead', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'karaoke', 'SUNDAY', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'two', 'stars', 'Zach', 'Chris', 'Chatman', 'Savannah', 'Candise', 'Lakota', 'first', 'meet', 'regional', 'church', 'choir', 'competition', 'Zach', 'one', 'stars', 'choir', 'group', 'chosen', 'compete', 'final', 'competition', 'fluke', 'Savannah', 'group', 'also', 'selected', 'compete', 'finals', 'Later', 'Zach', 'mom', 'new', 'job', 'are', 'forced', 'move', 'Zach', 'attending', 'new', 'school', 'out', 'be', 'same', 'school', 'where', 'Savannah', 'Savannah', 'friends', 'try', 'get', 'Zach', 'join', 'choir', 'connected', 'old', 'choir', ""n't"", 'want', 'compete', 'old', 'friends', 'tragedy', 'Zach', 'friends', 'everyone', 'reconsider', 'what', 'important', 'lives', 'where', 'loyalty', 'should', 'fall.There', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'songs', 'SUNDAY', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'terrible', 'Candise', 'Lakota', 'beautiful', 'attention', 'scene', 'foul', 'language', 'violence', 'movie', 'deliver', 'message', 'importance', 'using', 'one', 'gifts', 'regardless', 'one', 'rewarded', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'movie.But', 'SUNDAY', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'choreographed', 'first', 'timers', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'give', 'first-timers', 'break', 'movie', 'bad', 'bad', 'SUNDAY', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'acting', 'middle', 'school', 'skits', 'most', 'acting', 'movie', 'Most', 'songs', 'are', 'covered', 'cheese', 'schmaltz', 'have', 'beat', 'vibe', 'feels', 'Carmen', 'song', 'late', '1980s', 'early', '1990s', 'Candise', 'Lakota', 'gorgeous', 'quite', 'talented', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'co-star', 'Chris', 'Chatman', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'second-rate', 'musical', 'watered-downed', 'other', 'musicals', 'much', 'plot', 'SUNDAY', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'watered-downed', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'barely', 'ounce', 'originality', 'whole', 'story.I', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'SUNDAY', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'fact', 'were', 'certain', 'parts', 'were', 'painful', 'watch', 'especially', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'especially', 'foul', 'language', 'violence', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'fluffy-feel-goodness', 'happy', 'ending', 'actually', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'originality', 'creativity', 'decent', 'acting', 'attempts', 'engage', 'audience', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'something', 'else']",Sunday School Musical
