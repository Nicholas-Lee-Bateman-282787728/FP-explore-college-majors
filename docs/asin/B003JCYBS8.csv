The 1959-61 Gordon Scott Tarzan films may have been the best produced and best scripted, but Mike Henry is a terrific Tarzan&#8212;especially since, in this film, he is a sophisticated world traveler who only &#34;goes native&#34; when the task at hand calls for it.  Very cool!There are many eye-popping scenes in this film, which make viewing worthwhile.  However, the weak link is the script: it is generally superficial and un-involving.  The aforementioned Scott films crackled thanks to finely tuned characters whose interactions and circumstances drew us in.  In &#34;Valley of Gold,&#34; neither Tarzan nor the supporting cast ever get a chance to say enough to make the viewer feel personally engaged.Nevertheless, it's a fine looking film and refreshing to see people with combed hair and clothes that fit...among other delights.",4,Slickest Tarzan of them All,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2014,867,"['always', 'liked', 'movie', '1959-61', 'Gordon', 'Scott', 'Tarzan', 'films', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'produced', 'best', 'scripted', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'terrific', 'Tarzan', '8212', 'especially', 'film', 'sophisticated', 'world', 'traveler', 'who', 'only', '34', 'native', '34', 'when', 'task', 'hand', 'calls', 'Very', 'cool', 'are', 'many', 'eye-popping', 'scenes', 'film', 'make', 'viewing', 'worthwhile', 'However', 'weak', 'link', 'script', 'generally', 'superficial', 'un-involving', 'aforementioned', 'Scott', 'films', 'crackled', 'thanks', 'finely', 'tuned', 'characters', 'interactions', 'circumstances', 'drew', '34', 'Valley', 'Gold', '34', 'Tarzan', 'supporting', 'cast', 'ever', 'get', 'chance', 'say', 'enough', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'personally', 'engaged.Nevertheless', 'fine', 'looking', 'film', 'refreshing', 'see', 'people', 'combed', 'hair', 'clothes', 'fit', 'other', 'delights']",Tarzan And The Valley Of Gold
1347370,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B003JCYBS8,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[18, 18]","1966's ""Tarzan and the Valley of Gold"", part of producer Sy Weintraub's continuing effort to both 'update' Tarzan and achieve some fidelity with Edgar Rice Burrough's original vision, was a film three years in the making. His previous Tarzan, Jock Mahoney, was too old to build a franchise around (at 44), and had nearly died from illnesses contracted during the making of ""Tarzan's Three Challenges"", in Thailand, in 1963. Actor and producer had mutually agreed to end their working arrangement (not surprisingly!), and Weintraub now searched for a tall, dark, charismatic athlete-type in his thirties, who could convincingly perform stunts, look good in a loincloth, and would be willing to commit to both movie and television 'Tarzan' projects.Enter football star Mike Henry...the 6'3"" Los Angeles Rams linebacker, a six-year NFL vet, was doing bit parts at Warner Brothers during the off-seasons, and announced he wished to retire from the game and act full-time. At nearly 30, with a ripped, Adonis-like physique, and swarthy good looks, Henry had already caught the attention of producer Bill Dozier, who was courting him for his upcoming 'Batman' project (long before it turned 'camp', with Adam West), and Weintraub had to act quickly and decisively to commit him to Tarzan (his unwillingness to move quickly a few years earlier had cost him the services of Sean Connery as Tarzan, when Cubby Broccoli tapped him for the role of James Bond). Offering a package of films and television, and a lucrative salary that would increase as the boxoffice of the new series poured in, Henry was dazzled by the offer, and signed. Weintraub arranged to produce three films, nearly simultaneously, in Mexico and Brazil (to save production costs), while beginning production on a full-color television series, in Mexico. It would be a major gamble...While the first film would be produced, not by MGM, but by 'B' movie studio, American International (Paramount would release the second and third), the excellent director of both ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" and ""Tarzan's Three Challenges"", Robert Day, would helm the new film. A first-rate cast, including Nancy Kovack (a last-minute replacement for Sharon Tate), David Opatoshu, and talented child actor Manuel Padilla Jr. would support Henry, and jungle animals traditionally associated with Tarzan, lions and chimps, which had disappeared in recent Tarzan films, would reappear. The kicker, though, was how to attract film audiences in the midst of the 'James Bond' craze of the 1960s...whether a wise decision or not, the new Tarzan film looked very much like a Bond movie for the first 20 minutes of running time, including flashy opening credits, jazzy music, quick, abrupt violence, a shootout at a public location, and Tarzan, himself, attired in a very Bondian, Fleet Street tan suit, wielding a pistol(!). It may have seemed more 'Doc Savage' than 'Lord Greystoke', but it certainly kept your attention!Happily, once Henry donned his loincloth, the film settled into a more traditional 'Tarzan' format, and was actually very, very good. The location scenes at an Aztec temple were breathtaking, Henry was excellent at action (if a bit stiff with dialogue), and the fairly standard plot (greedy villains wish to steal Aztec gold), never interfered with the big fights!The film, sadly, would not be the huge hit Weintraub had hoped, and everyone, at the time, was so busy trying to make the nearly impossible deadlines of the second and third film, there was little time to pause and review what was, and wasn't working. Unfortunately, with a rushed schedule, accidents were bound to happen...but that would be a story better told with the next Tarzan film, 1967's ""Tarzan and the Great River""...",5,Tarzan in the James Bond Era!,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,3745,"['1966', 'Tarzan', 'Valley', 'Gold', 'part', 'producer', 'Sy', 'Weintraub', 'continuing', 'effort', ""'update"", 'Tarzan', 'achieve', 'fidelity', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burrough', 'original', 'vision', 'was', 'film', 'three', 'years', 'making', 'previous', 'Tarzan', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'build', 'franchise', 'around', '44', 'had', 'nearly', 'died', 'illnesses', 'contracted', 'making', 'Tarzan', 'Three', 'Challenges', 'Thailand', '1963', 'Actor', 'producer', 'had', 'mutually', 'agreed', 'end', 'working', 'arrangement', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Weintraub', 'now', 'tall', 'dark', 'charismatic', 'athlete-type', 'thirties', 'who', 'could', 'convincingly', 'perform', 'stunts', 'look', 'good', 'loincloth', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'commit', 'movie', 'television', ""'Tarzan"", 'projects.Enter', 'football', 'star', 'Mike', 'Henry', '6', '3', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Rams', 'linebacker', 'six-year', 'NFL', 'vet', 'was', 'doing', 'bit', 'parts', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'off-seasons', 'announced', 'wished', 'retire', 'game', 'act', 'full-time', 'nearly', '30', 'ripped', 'Adonis-like', 'physique', 'swarthy', 'good', 'looks', 'Henry', 'had', 'already', 'caught', 'attention', 'producer', 'Bill', 'Dozier', 'who', 'was', 'courting', 'upcoming', ""'Batman"", 'project', 'long', 'turned', ""'camp"", 'Adam', 'West', 'Weintraub', 'had', 'act', 'quickly', 'decisively', 'commit', 'Tarzan', 'unwillingness', 'move', 'quickly', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'had', 'cost', 'services', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Tarzan', 'when', 'Cubby', 'Broccoli', 'tapped', 'role', 'James', 'Bond', 'Offering', 'package', 'films', 'television', 'lucrative', 'salary', 'would', 'increase', 'boxoffice', 'new', 'series', 'poured', 'Henry', 'was', 'dazzled', 'offer', 'signed', 'Weintraub', 'arranged', 'produce', 'three', 'films', 'nearly', 'simultaneously', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'save', 'production', 'costs', 'beginning', 'production', 'full-color', 'television', 'series', 'Mexico', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'gamble', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'produced', 'not', 'MGM', 'B', 'movie', 'studio', 'American', 'International', 'Paramount', 'would', 'release', 'second', 'third', 'excellent', 'director', 'Tarzan', 'Magnificent', 'Tarzan', 'Three', 'Challenges', 'Robert', 'Day', 'would', 'helm', 'new', 'film', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'including', 'Nancy', 'Kovack', 'last-minute', 'replacement', 'Sharon', 'Tate', 'David', 'Opatoshu', 'talented', 'child', 'actor', 'Manuel', 'Padilla', 'Jr.', 'would', 'support', 'Henry', 'jungle', 'animals', 'traditionally', 'associated', 'Tarzan', 'lions', 'chimps', 'had', 'disappeared', 'recent', 'Tarzan', 'films', 'would', 'reappear', 'kicker', 'was', 'how', 'attract', 'film', 'audiences', 'midst', ""'James"", 'Bond', 'craze', '1960s', 'wise', 'decision', 'not', 'new', 'Tarzan', 'film', 'looked', 'very', 'much', 'Bond', 'movie', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'including', 'flashy', 'opening', 'credits', 'jazzy', 'music', 'quick', 'abrupt', 'violence', 'shootout', 'public', 'location', 'Tarzan', 'attired', 'very', 'Bondian', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'tan', 'suit', 'wielding', 'pistol', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'more', ""'Doc"", 'Savage', ""'Lord"", 'Greystoke', 'certainly', 'kept', 'attention', 'Happily', 'once', 'Henry', 'donned', 'loincloth', 'film', 'settled', 'more', 'traditional', ""'Tarzan"", 'format', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'location', 'scenes', 'Aztec', 'temple', 'were', 'breathtaking', 'Henry', 'was', 'excellent', 'action', 'bit', 'stiff', 'dialogue', 'fairly', 'standard', 'plot', 'greedy', 'villains', 'wish', 'steal', 'Aztec', 'gold', 'never', 'interfered', 'big', 'fights', 'film', 'sadly', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'huge', 'hit', 'Weintraub', 'had', 'hoped', 'everyone', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'busy', 'trying', 'make', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'deadlines', 'second', 'third', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'time', 'pause', 'review', 'what', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'Unfortunately', 'rushed', 'schedule', 'accidents', 'were', 'bound', 'happen', 'would', 'be', 'story', 'better', 'told', 'next', 'Tarzan', 'film', '1967', 'Tarzan', 'Great', 'River']",Tarzan And The Valley Of Gold

KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[1, 1]","I've been searching for a few of my favorite Tarzan films for many years and I am pleased to spread the word that Warner Archives has released several Tarzan titles and many other rare films on DVD. I watched many Tarzan films as a kid mostly the films starring Johnny Weissmuller, but I watched the Tarzan TV series starring Ron Ely and many others Tarzan films starring the various actors to take on the role of the ""Lord of the Apes"".While I enjoyed seeing this film again, it didn't age well for me as this film is very juvenile even for a Tarzan film. This film features Mike Henry for the first time as the ape man and I have mixed feelings about him playing the character.

In this films favor, it does mark the first appearance of Manual Padilla Jr. as Tarzan's boy sidekick who went on to do another Tarzan film(Tarzan and the Great River)and played Jai on the Tarzan TV series I mentioned earlier in this review. Although playing a different character in two films he might as well have been playing Jai from the TV series.This film is quite bizarre as it starts out like a James Bond film with Tarzan dressed in a business suit or ""monkey suit""(pun intended haha!)...in you will, and out of his normal surroundings. Once he gets back to the jungle, he enlist the help of some of his jungle friends, a Leopard(thanks Karen), a Lion and a Chimpanzee before meeting up with the boy played by Padilla. The entire production to me seems a little phony(more than usual)especially comparing it to 'Tarzan's Three Challenges'.

In the last episode, Tarzan, played by another man, parachuted into Thailand. In this 1966 episode, he flies into Mexico dressed in a business suit and is attacked by a gunman who tries to kill him. He responds like a James Bond secret agent and kills his attacker. In fact, the first quarter of this entertaining film is much like James Bond, except for the music. There is even a gadget, as in the Bond series; however, it is used by the criminal, perfectly played by David Apatoshu.Tarzan's mission is to find, protect, and deliver home an Aztec boy who has been kidnapped. The kidnappers want the boy to reveal to them where his hidden home filled with gold is located. Tarzan drops his suit, and scantily dressed in the well-known Tarzan outfit of a skimpy bathing suit type pants runs off with the help of a monkey, a leopard, and a lion.

Zubin Mehta may not be my absolute favorite conductor-but he has a gorgeous wife, Nancy Kovack-and she never looked better than in this movie. Unfortunately, every time I watch this, and see Mike Henry's abs, I feel I should run to the gym and do 500 crunches (could I do them over a month maybe?) This had to be influenced by the Bond films, since Tarzan looks like Sean Connery in the opening sequence (or at least Matt Helm). The nice thing is I don't have to listen to the inane dialogue-in fact I'm playing the Vladar/Wadsworth recording of the Beethoven 4 and 5 concerti in the background, because there is no plot! Gotta love the fact that Henry's and Kovack's hair never moves. I didn't know they had so many beauty parlors around the Mayan ruins, did you? Plus, the Mayan Chief looks like a refugee from the Central European casting lot!",3,"Fun, stupid, and Nancy Kovack!",1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,888,"['Tarzan', 'meets', 'Goldfinger', 'What', 'h', 'Zubin', 'Mehta', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'conductor-but', 'gorgeous', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'Kovack-and', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'watch', 'see', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'abs', 'feel', 'should', 'run', 'gym', 'do', '500', 'crunches', 'could', 'do', 'over', 'month', 'maybe', 'had', 'be', 'influenced', 'Bond', 'films', 'Tarzan', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'opening', 'sequence', 'least', 'Matt', 'Helm', 'nice', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'listen', 'inane', 'dialogue-in', 'fact', ""'m"", 'playing', 'Vladar/Wadsworth', 'recording', 'Beethoven', '4', '5', 'concerti', 'background', 'plot', 'Got', 'ta', 'love', 'fact', 'Henry', 'Kovack', 'hair', 'never', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'beauty', 'parlors', 'Mayan', 'ruins', 'did', 'Mayan', 'Chief', 'refugee', 'Central', 'European', 'casting', 'lot']",Tarzan And The Valley Of Gold
1347379,A20WKQ948WZOQJ,B003JCYBS8,Wes Saylors Jr.,"[1, 1]","Boy is this a movie.  We are first introdued to Tarzan (the ape man) as he steps off a modern, 60s-era jet plane, suitcase in hand and tailored suit clinging to his Tarzan-y body.  A man dressed as a chauffeur approaches him: ""Are you the one they call Tarzan?""  ""Yes, I am,"" replies the one they call Tarzan.  And we're off. -- This movie, one of three starring Mike Henry, tries (and mostly succeeds) in marrying the popular James Bond movies with the Tarzan world.  In this Tarzan, the Lord of the Jungle sips martinis and adjusts his tie and accepts rides from strangers.  But when the Cheetah pooh hits the fan, he dons his loin cloth, grabs the biggest knife available and tracks villains in the jungle, using only his keen Tarzan senses.  Is it fun?  Oh, yeah.  Is it silly?  Oh, yeah.--This curiosity is actually a very fun ride.  Tarzan ends up in a vast city of gold, helping the natives there thwart bad guys who would have the city for themselves. -- Mike Henry makes a suitably James Bond-looking Tarzan, and the opening credits along (which recall Dr No and Goldfinger) are almost (but not quite) worth the price of admission alone.  To say they don't make them like this anymore is an understatement.  I don't think they ever made them like this, except this one time.  It's as fun as any Tarzan-James Bond hybrid can be.  And if you really want to know what's worth the price of admission: When Tarzan takes out a would-be assassain with a huge mock-up of a bottle of Coca Cola.  Now THAT'S worth the price of admission.",4,Tarzan ... 007!,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,1536,"['Boy', 'movie', 'are', 'first', 'introdued', 'Tarzan', 'ape', 'man', 'modern', '60s-era', 'jet', 'plane', 'suitcase', 'hand', 'tailored', 'suit', 'clinging', 'Tarzan-y', 'body', 'man', 'dressed', 'chauffeur', 'Are', 'one', 'call', 'Tarzan', 'Yes', 'am', 'one', 'call', 'Tarzan', ""'re"", 'off', 'movie', 'one', 'three', 'starring', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'tries', 'mostly', 'marrying', 'popular', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'Tarzan', 'world', 'Tarzan', 'Lord', 'Jungle', 'sips', 'martinis', 'tie', 'accepts', 'rides', 'strangers', 'when', 'Cheetah', 'pooh', 'fan', 'loin', 'cloth', 'grabs', 'biggest', 'knife', 'available', 'tracks', 'villains', 'jungle', 'using', 'only', 'keen', 'Tarzan', 'senses', 'fun', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'silly', 'Oh', 'yeah.', 'curiosity', 'actually', 'very', 'fun', 'ride', 'Tarzan', 'up', 'vast', 'city', 'gold', 'helping', 'natives', 'thwart', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'city', 'Henry', 'suitably', 'James', 'Bond-looking', 'Tarzan', 'opening', 'credits', 'recall', 'Dr', 'No', 'Goldfinger', 'are', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'understatement', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'time', 'as', 'fun', 'Tarzan-James', 'Bond', 'hybrid', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'When', 'Tarzan', 'out', 'would-be', 'assassain', 'huge', 'mock-up', 'bottle', 'Coca', 'Cola', 'Now', 'THAT', 'price', 'admission']",Tarzan And The Valley Of Gold
