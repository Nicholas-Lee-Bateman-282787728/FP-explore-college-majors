They did enjoy it and then I was surprised by the second show In the Kitchen. It had a naked little boy used for the story. Not something I would recommend for my children to watch much. Plus one of the shows features a little boy Pier singing a song about saying, ""I don't care"". Not something I'm trying to teach my young children.

1154639,A2WJCE8VF3STFW,B0016OKR70,Judith,"[61, 62]","This DVD contains a collection of the best of the Maurice Sendak children's books.  The subtitles come on automatically so the child can read or SING along, but you can turn them off if you prefer, of course.First is Where the Wild Things Are, a story of a boy having a dream about friendly monsters after being sent to his room for punishment.  The illustrations are bold and the reading and accompanying sound and music add to the story.  Next is In the Night Kitchen, which is read and sung.  The tune is very catchy.  One note, this is also a dream story.  As the boy, Mickey, dreams he is falling his pajamas fall off.  The nudity is not graphic, but you could skip that story if it bothers you.  The rest of the stories are from the Nutshell books, which Carole King put to music for her project Really Rosie.  These tunes are absolutely wonderful.  Your children will sing along and sing them other times, too.  Chicken Soup With Rice seems to be the favorite of my little library patrons.  They will sing it any time they spot the book.  And, these are good songs that adults enjoy as well, not cloyingly obnoxious kiddie songs that will fray your nerves.  The Nutshell books are Chicken Soup With Rice, Pierre, One Was Johnny, and Alligators All Around.This DVD is definitely on my ""must have"" list for my library's DVD collection in our children's room.",5,A collection of classics,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,1363,"['DVD', 'collection', 'best', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'children', 'books', 'subtitles', 'come', 'automatically', 'child', 'can', 'read', 'SING', 'along', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'prefer', 'course.First', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'story', 'boy', 'having', 'dream', 'friendly', 'monsters', 'being', 'sent', 'room', 'punishment', 'illustrations', 'are', 'bold', 'reading', 'accompanying', 'sound', 'music', 'add', 'story', 'Next', 'Night', 'Kitchen', 'read', 'sung', 'tune', 'very', 'catchy', 'One', 'note', 'also', 'dream', 'story', 'boy', 'Mickey', 'dreams', 'falling', 'pajamas', 'fall', 'off', 'nudity', 'not', 'graphic', 'could', 'skip', 'story', 'rest', 'stories', 'are', 'Nutshell', 'books', 'Carole', 'King', 'put', 'music', 'project', 'Really', 'Rosie', 'tunes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'children', 'will', 'sing', 'along', 'sing', 'other', 'times', 'too', 'Chicken', 'Soup', 'Rice', 'be', 'favorite', 'little', 'library', 'patrons', 'will', 'sing', 'time', 'spot', 'book', 'are', 'good', 'songs', 'adults', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'cloyingly', 'obnoxious', 'kiddie', 'songs', 'will', 'fray', 'nerves', 'Nutshell', 'books', 'are', 'Chicken', 'Soup', 'Rice', 'Pierre', 'One', 'Was', 'Johnny', 'Alligators', 'All', 'Around.This', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'must', 'have', 'list', 'library', 'DVD', 'collection', 'children', 'room']",Where the Wild Things Are...and 5 More Stories by Maurice Sendak
