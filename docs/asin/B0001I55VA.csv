807050,A11YV6VC51HJTV,B0001I55VA,"Blake Petit ""Novelist, columnist & reviewer""","[2, 2]","I heard a lot of really good things about this film when it was released last year, with some reviewers saying it was so good that Disney should have released it theatrically. I can't say I disagree. While the story pretty much throws the classic book out the window, it's still entertaining enough, as our trio plays a group of handymen who dream of being Musketeers. When the Princess (Minnie Mouse, natch) wants a royal bodyguard, the dirty captain (classic villain Pete) gets the bumblers into Musketeer uniforms, counting Goofy's ineptness, Donald's cowardice and Mickey's diminutive size to allow him to kidnap the Princess and seize the throne.The movie is too short - just 68 minutes - but it packs plenty into the time it has. This is a really funny movie, with classic-style jokes, double-takes, musical stings and the like - everything you would want in an old-school cartoon. Pete gets one of his best showings in a long time, with really funny moments. The biggest problem I had was the music - rather than composing new songs, the filmmakers wrote lyrics to various pieces of operatic and classical music. It got a little distracting, to be honest. I found myself wishing they had either written new music or refrained from doing it musical-style entirely.At any rate, this movie proves there's still life in classic 2-D animation. I just can't wrap my brain around Disney's insistence in doing future projects with these characters in bloody CGI. A 3-D Mickey Mouse just doesn't look right. The movie is knocked down to a B grade from me because of the music, but at least there's one last entertaining animated flick from the house of mouse before they give up on classic animation entirely.",4,"Pretty good -- RIP, classic Disney animation",1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,1707,"['heard', 'lot', 'really', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Disney', 'should', 'have', 'released', 'theatrically', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'disagree', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'classic', 'book', 'window', 'still', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'trio', 'group', 'handymen', 'who', 'dream', 'being', 'Musketeers', 'When', 'Princess', 'Minnie', 'Mouse', 'natch', 'royal', 'bodyguard', 'dirty', 'captain', 'classic', 'villain', 'Pete', 'bumblers', 'Musketeer', 'uniforms', 'counting', 'Goofy', 'ineptness', 'Donald', 'cowardice', 'Mickey', 'diminutive', 'size', 'allow', 'kidnap', 'Princess', 'seize', 'throne.The', 'movie', 'too', 'short', 'just', '68', 'minutes', 'plenty', 'time', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'classic-style', 'jokes', 'double-takes', 'musical', 'stings', 'like', 'everything', 'would', 'want', 'old-school', 'cartoon', 'Pete', 'one', 'best', 'showings', 'long', 'time', 'really', 'funny', 'moments', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'music', 'rather', 'composing', 'new', 'songs', 'filmmakers', 'wrote', 'lyrics', 'various', 'pieces', 'operatic', 'classical', 'music', 'got', 'little', 'distracting', 'be', 'honest', 'found', 'wishing', 'had', 'written', 'new', 'music', 'refrained', 'doing', 'musical-style', 'entirely.At', 'rate', 'movie', 'still', 'life', 'classic', '2-D', 'animation', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'brain', 'Disney', 'insistence', 'doing', 'future', 'projects', 'characters', 'bloody', 'CGI', '3-D', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'movie', 'knocked', 'down', 'B', 'grade', 'music', 'least', 'one', 'last', 'entertaining', 'animated', 'flick', 'house', 'mouse', 'give', 'up', 'classic', 'animation', 'entirely']",N/A
807051,A3EW2L59UBHQSG,B0001I55VA,Bruce Aguilar,"[3, 6]","Well this was the best direct to DVD movie from Disney I have seen.  That said, it's no feature animation.  It plays more like an extended Mouse Works show.  Cute, with a few real laughs, but a very flimsy story.  The characterizations of Daisy and Clarabell have been drastically altered (and Clarabell seems to have lost her udder).  Now Daisy is the worldly-wise mentor of Minnie and Clarabell is a more villainous character.  These changes may be just because the characters are ""playing"" roles in a story, but the more ""contemporary"" feel of these characters didn't sit well with me.Strongest is the animation and voice work.  Production wise, the feel is of a top-notch Saturday Morning cartoon.  I wish the backgrounds were more detailed and textured, but it is a direct to DVD movie.  The children in the audience seemed to really like the movie and appropriately so, as it seems more aimed to children than a general audience.  Though there is an occasional wink at an more adult viewer.One other thing I really didn't like was the music which is all set to widely known classical arrangements such as The Nutcracker Suite.  The idea might've worked if the lyrics weren't so bland.  If it was an attempt to be Fantasia or Sleeping Beauty, it didn't work.  It's undoubtedly the weakest part of the movie.Still there is no denying the appeal of seeing the original Mickey gang together again in a new story.  That was the biggest thrill for me.

I have to say the production quality is not what it used to be in the real Disney era (read before Walt died). I assume most of these ""Folks"" who have reviewed this are either too young to have seen many of the quality flims Walt was the master of or they let the DVD player run as a baby sitter for very young children being satisfied that it keeps them involved  for 60 minutes. The movie is so convoluted, and far from the Three Musketeers I had a hard time seeing where it fits the story. I'm sure its great for kids 2 to 6, but really this is not what I expect from Disney. Of course this is not the Disney I know and love from 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. This is a new era Disney which I must say I dislike its not even of the quality of the 80's and 90's stuff. Finding Nemo was a much better, and involving, entertaining movie. The stuff that Pixar is involved with is of a higher quality than the dribble Disney has been putting out on its own. I can only say that if you have very young children, who are easily entertained then this might suffice, as an adult the age of 40 I had a hard time watching this. In the past I had no troubles watching high quality Disney flims, cartoons whatever.

807061,AC1U7PPQJKA9D,B0001I55VA,"James Sparks ""Hawkeye""","[2, 2]","I am really glad that Disney is starting to wheel out it's classic stars again.  While I do enjoy the feature films like Lion King, Tarzan, Peter Pan, etc.. I think their is nothing more ""Disney"" than the original stable of characters that made the Disney company the family studio.Disney recently has come out with the ""Disney Treasures collections"" and several of those are the old Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Pluto cartoons.  When I watch those with my son I always end up thinking two things.1.  I wish they would display the original shorts more&2.  I wish they would make more shorts for the classic characters.I'm so glad that Disney has started doing that with the Once upon a Christmas series and now with ""The 3 Musketeers""  And I think all of these new ventures into Mickey are worth while and done excellently.The comedy in this movie is wonderful.  There is some undertone humor only the adults will get but it's not raunchy or inappropriate, and the slapstick humor is wonderful.  Disney truly made an excellent movie for the family here and I hope all the Disney lovers out there or just families looking for a good movie will pick this up.I know this in some ways, was a dangerous undertaking for Disney because Mickey is more than a character, but he really is an icon.  So if you portray him in a way that the public doesn't like you can have a severe backlash, but Disney handled Mickey's latest outing with all the class Walt Disney himself would have wanted.Also, there are a few characters in the movie that really surprised me.1.  Pete:  was great!  a wonderful villain all the way back to Steamboat Willie.2.  Donald:  The attitude and personality of Donald has changed drastically in this movie.  He's gone from the hothead to the passive coward.  I found that a little unsettling; I hope that trend does not continue.3.  Clarabelle the cow:  Clara was a regular in the old (and I mean Old) Disney cartoon shorts, but has been MIA for like 60 years.  So to see her again was great.4.

807063,A3BC8YL69NOCUP,B0001I55VA,jmpg,"[2, 2]","There's no doubt about it, Disney has been very disappointing in the last several years. They've already tarnished their image ever since they began releasing unwanted and mediocre sequels to their classics. Even Disney's latest original offerings have been less than impressive. Now along comes The Three Musketeers. No, this film is not going to rescue Disney's reputation from the horrid material they've been producing and it's not going to revolutionize anything. In the end, who knows, you just might be entertained by surprise. Even though the film is quite short and the animation and soundtrack aren't masterpiece quality, it is still watchable hands down.Many of Disney's current works lack any form of clever humor, but this isn't so much the case in The Three Musketeers. The humor in the movie is integrated nicely (Minnie and Daisy eating burgers and fries in this time period?), and there will be some jokes and lines along the way that only Disney advocates will recognize or understand. By far, this is arguably the wackiest Disney flick since The Emperor's New Groove. As for the bad aspects of the movie, Disney's watercolor scheme returns and is still grating to the eyes. The soundtrack is average at best, with oddly vocalized versions of famous classical music filling one's ears, and with a few song numbers, including Pete's and Clairabel and Goofy's estranged duet, being lyrically amusing.Watching The Three Musketeers almost brings back some nostalgic Disney feel into the fold as well. The nature of its concept is very reminiscent of the cartoon shorts Disney made in the 30s and 40s. Be forewarned, since the film is (obviously) geared toward the very young age group. If you couldn't tolerate Disney's recent kiddy-flavored material, then I suggest you stay away from this product.

807064,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B0001I55VA,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[3, 3]","The first thing that surprised me about MICKEY'S THE THREE MUSKETEERS was how amazing the animation was.  Most of Disney's direct-to-video features are usually lacking in the art department (no doubt to the fact that making animation for feature films is expensive), but this one is absolutely gorgeous.  The backgrounds are painted with inked-watercolors in the style of ""Uncle Walt""'s good old days.  The animation is as fluid as one of their animated features.  If anything, this one should have gone to theaters, as it would definitely (IMO) make a lot more cash than the other features the Mouse House released this year.But I'm getting ahead of myself.  True to its promise, this woefully short (60 minutes with a seven-minute credit scroll is not enough!) ""feature"" is outrageously funny, action-packed, and not too syrupy either (even the romance between our heroes and their girlfriends is handled in an deliberately silly light), although it DOES manage to pack a heartfelt message about true camaraderie and friendship.This isn't a faithful retelling of Alexandre Dumas' novel (but then again, this IS Disney we're talking about); however, the best part about this feature is that it clearly addresses it to the audience.  Yes, the film has nothing to do with the original, but the actual story is something that could have been imagined by Walt himself.  It's also full of action and derring-do:  how wonderful it is to see Mickey, Donald, and Goofy cross swords with the nasty Beagle Boys (and their leader, Captain Peg Leg Pete) to save the lovely Princess Minnie!  Even better, there's a showstopping, hilariously paced climax at an opera house, which arguably is the highlight of the film.  (The tunes are excerpts from ""The Pirates of Penzance"", meaning that we get to hear a REALLY REALLY fast rendition of the Modern Major General's patter song!)The best part about this movie, however, is that Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Minnie, Daisy, Pete, and surprisingly, Clarabelle Cow, all get to ACT and play actual roles, and not simply exist just for the sake of being there.  Mickey is still his confident, reassuring self, but he is also spunkier.  Goofy is, well, Goofy, and even though Donald's role is reduced to that of a big chicken (no offense, Donald), he manages to be his cantankerous self.  Probably the most amazing role in the movie is that of Clarabelle.  Usually, she is cast as a secondary character, but this time she gets to be evil Pete's lieutenant... until Goofy's goodness touches her ""little cow-hide heart"".  (Her moo, he sings, in a very amusing parody of the ""Habanera"" from CARMEN, is music to his ears!)Speaking of which, the songs in the movie are barely a minute to two-minutes in length, but they don't feel forced--and they're all pieces of classical music set to lyrics.  Most of these pieces are sung by ze very French Troubadour Turtle--a newcomer to the Disney group--who narrates the story from time to time and appears in unexpected cameo roles.  But as mentioned, Goofy and Clarabelle get a very funny duet, and even Pete gets his own ""bad guy"" song (set to ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"")!  The musical score by Bruce Broughton, incidentally, is terrific, and does an elegant job spoofing the classical motifs throughout.  This is no doubt to Broughton's experience in scoring episodes for TINY TOON ADVENTURES and ANIMANIACS.All in all, this movie is, true to its tagline, ""all for fun and fun for all!""  While it probably may not match up to the classic Disney films, it certainly is better than a lot of the films the Mouse House has put out recently, and definitely kicks the crap out of their embarrassingly disappointing HOME ON THE RANGE.  There are lots to marvel at, laugh along with, and ultimately, cheer, by the time the end credits (cleverly embedded within the pages of a comic book!) roll.  If anything, I think this film far exceeds Disney's outrageous output of ""cheapquels"" to their classic films, which don't really need them.The DVD presents the feature in a flawless transfer, and the audio mix is even better.  The bonus features, unfortunately, are hit and miss.  The cast commentary (where Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Pete get a chance to talk together!) is a hoot, but it's only five minutes long.  The ""behind-the-scenes"" documentary is about as close as buffs will get to a feature detailing the production, but its mostly standard and not anything we haven't seen before (although it DOES continue the idea that Mickey and the gang are actors!).  The Many Hats of Mickey, however, is the real gem among the features; here we get to see clips of the Mouse's famous features (narrated by Troubadour Turtle!).  This far outshines the other features, which are at best, kiddie-fare.In closing my review, I'd like to say that the Disney Fast Find option is absolutely unnecessary, almost as if to imply that kids are too ""dumb"" to use their remote control to make their selections.  (Fortunately, you can skip to the Main Menu.)  If Disney decides to abandon this feature on future DVD releases, fine with me.",4,"Terrific DTV ""feature""--classic Disney style!",1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,5085,"['first', 'thing', 'surprised',

All I can say is it's about time!! Too many of today's kids do not realize that Mickey, Donald, and friends are more than pre-school posters or a watch face. This is the perfect movie to introduce your child to the characters that made Disney what it is.The Three Musketeers is a fun romp, but understand -  this has absolutely nothing to do with the original story, and, believe it or not, Disney doesn't hide this fact like they usually do. In this  new version, the three musketeers (Mickey, Donald, and Goofy) start off as janitors (!?!) who actually hope to become musketeers. Little do they know...I guess the reason why this movie worked for me is that it held the interest throughout for my 3 year old daughter as well as my 13 year old son - it made them both laugh out loud a number of times. They don't seem to do that with Fairly Oddparents or that teenage robot cartoon, so I guess that's a good thing.Yes, I recommend this lite Disney movie - why didn't they release this at the movie theaters - and hopefully this is a new beginning for the classic Disney characters.Now, how about releasing ""Song of the South"" on DVD?",4,Keep the Classic Characters Coming,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,1259,"['Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'Goofy', 'Minnie', 'Mouse', 'Peg', 'Leg', 'Pete', 'together', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'say', 'time', 'Too', 'many', 'today', 'kids', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'Mickey', 'Donald', 'friends', 'are', 'more', 'pre-school', 'posters', 'watch', 'face', 'perfect', 'movie', 'introduce', 'child', 'characters', 'made', 'Disney', 'what', 'is.The', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'fun', 'romp', 'understand', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'original', 'story', 'believe', 'not', 'Disney', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact', 'usually', 'do', 'new', 'version', 'three', 'musketeers', 'Mickey', 'Donald', 'Goofy', 'start', 'off', 'janitors', 'who', 'actually', 'hope', 'become', 'musketeers', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'guess', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'worked', 'held', 'interest', '3', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', '13', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'number', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'Fairly', 'Oddparents', 'teenage', 'robot', 'cartoon', 'guess', 'good', 'thing.Yes', 'recommend', 'lite', 'Disney', 'movie', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'release', 'movie', 'theaters', 'hopefully', 'new', 'beginning', 'classic', 'Disney', 'characters.Now', 'how', 'releasing', 'Song', 'South', 'DVD']",N/A

The best parts, for me, in the movie may be the french turtle singing to classical music pieces.  Quite a few extras on the disc as well, but not quite as fun as the actual movie.  Kids should like this overall, but i think there's enough here to where adults can appreciate it too.

He was scary and mean and VILLAINOUS. First, they took that GOOD voice actor away (HE actually sounded SCARY!), and then his cigar.  So he's become a lisping, unfunny moron.  And #2: THEY DITCHED THE WEASELS! Why, Disney, WHY?  The weasels were awesome!  And they sure beat the stupid Beagle Boys, who aren't funny OR scary.  The weasels were BOTH.The story needed a lot more work, too.  How would KIDNAPPING Minnie, but not HURTING her make him king?  Just a couple more things to work on. Also, the sequences would have been better if they had kept talking to the barest of minimums.  Having a silent cartoon would have been better, since that's basically what mickey and the others started as.  I mean, yeah, they HAD sound, but you could still read everything that was going on without it.

807074,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B0001I55VA,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 2]","Along with Disney's newest direct to video animated film, The Three Musketeers, comes a little something extra: proof that not all Disney direct to video films are a waste of time and money! Oh, Disney has made some rather good direct to video films in the past (An Extremely Goofy Movie, Lion King 2, Inspector Gadget 2), and has made several that were ""almost"" good or ""fairly good,"" but not nearly enough compared to the amount of direct to video releases they have produced. That's why every time they do get one right it seems like cause for celebration! A sad state of affairs, but that's just the way it is. On the bright side though, Disney's The Three Musketeers, starring Mickey, Donald, and Goofy, is just such a cause for celebration!The story is nothing like the original classic, so I hope you're not expecting that. And that doesn't make it ""Neo-Disney"" either. In Walt's day they rewrote EVERYTHING too. Anyway, this is a story of three NEW Musketeers...well, janitors really. Ya see, when Mickey, Donald, and Goofy were just little street urchins, they were saved from a group of ""bad guys"" by the famed Musketeers of Dumas' classic tale. From that day on, Mickey and his pals dreamed of joining the ranks of the noble Musketeers. Unfortunately, Musketeer Captain Pete finds the whole idea hilarious. In his opinion, Mickey is too small, Donald is too cowardly, and Goofy is, well, goofy. But fortune smiles on the three would-be heroes one day, when an attempt on Princess Minnie's life is narrowly avoided. The Princess orders Captain Pete to assign her some bodyguards, and since the Captain is really a villain with plans to take over the throne, he chooses the three fumbling janitors for the job. Suddenly, the boys' dreams have come true, and they're swashbuckling Musketeers in the service of the beautiful princess!  They are put to the test in no time, however, when Captain Pete's flunkies make an attempt to kidnap the princess. But, in a rare moment of inspiration for the Goof, a plan is cooked up and the new Musketeers save the day. This kicks off a romance between Mickey and the Princess, who has been carrying a dream of her own: to find her one true love. Minnie's Lady in Waiting, Daisy Duck, manages to resist the lure of romance, though the much less daydream-prone femme begins to weaken at times when noticing the joy such thoughts give Minnie. Goofy is the only one left without a potential mate, but not for long. When Captain Pete's nasty henchwoman, Clarabelle Cow, is ordered to send Goofy to a watery grave, the two fall in love! Everything comes to a climactic finish the night of a big opera performance, when the three Musketeers must learn the real meaning of ""All for one, and one for all"" in order to defeat Captain Pete and save Princess Minnie!Disney's The Three Musketeers is a wonderful new movie from Disney Toon Studios! Many have already written the magic of Disney off as a thing of the past, and it's true, this one new success is not enough to redeem their good name (and I say these things as an incredibly loyal Disney fanatic), but it certainly is a spring of hope for those of us who have been searching for one (unfortunately, the preview for the new and entirely computer-animated ""Mickey's Twice Upon A Christmas"" does its best to smother that hope)! So, why does the Fab Five's Three Musketeers film shine so brightly amongst the other direct to video films in Disney's animation library? Well, for one, The Three Musketeers is consistently very well animated! In the past, we have seen everything from flat-out terrible animation, such as in ""Return of Jafar,"" to films that bounce back and forth from good to bad, such as ""Aladdin and the King of Thieves,"" to films that can't help but look weird since they are really just compilations of TV shows with (even worse) new animation linking them together. Almost as important as the animation quality though, is the story. Again, The Three Musketeers comes out a winner! The story is adventurous, inspiring, swashbuckling, romantic, hilarious, and just overall fun! All the characters are as familiar and true to themselves as ever, even with Donald playing the role of a coward this time around, and Pete is always a real treat. The Three Musketeers also has great songs, and that's a bit of a surprise from direct to video. They're all brief excerpts of classical music accompanied by new, often hilarious lyrics, and they're great! Thank goodness for no pop music! Unless you're going to use the heavenly Hilary Duff, keep that pop music out of my Disney period pieces! The singing Turtle narrator was particularly entertaining, though he did look a little odd with the contemporary looking gloves. It's not all wine and roses, though. I have to complain about the film being overpriced, though it's hard to, knowing the sort of direct to video releases we've seen in the past. It is billed as a feature, but it is hardly long enough for that title, and the extras are not that fascinating, save for 3. The Behind the Scenes section has two nice features: A hilarious, but brief (only one scene) audio commentary from Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Pete, and a purely for fun behind the scenes short that is mostly comprised of interviews with the creators as they discuss what it was like to ""work"" with the classic Disney stars. There is also a nice set of deleted scenes, a rare treat with animated films. The other extras aren't really worth bothering with. So, one would expect a bit more entertainment for the price. Still, one must keep in mind the effort and cost put into it, and that it didn't have a theatrical release to make a bunch of money off of first, so perhaps we're all a bit spoiled by the dropping DVD prices lately. The only other complaint that comes to mind is the absence of a classic character that could have fit in so perfectly: Clara Cluck. This operatic talent would have been an excellent choice to use during the opera climax, so where was she? I suppose if they had added her, folks would have wanted to see Horace Horsecollar too, but why not? Still, it's a minor complaint. Overall, I highly recommend The Three Musketeers for any fans of Mickey and the gang, and old-school Disney. It definitely harkens back to the days of Mickey and the Beanstalk, or the 1980's and 90's classics, Mickey's Christmas Carol and The Prince and the Pauper. It's a film I could imagine being made in Walt's day, full of humor and fun. And where are these people coming from who hate watercolor backgrounds so much? They were gorgeous (and quite appropriate) in Lilo and Stitch, and they're gorgeous in The Three Musketeers! So, grit your teeth and close your eyes, and fork over the cash for this new classic! It's overpriced, but when you realize that you've paid the same for lower quality direct to video Disney in the past, you'll be comforted with the knowledge that this film is several notches above the others. It's great fun that you'll want to watch again and again!",5,Disney Brings New Hope For Direct To Video!,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,7015,"['Disney', 'newest', 'direct', 'video', 'animated', 'film',

And I, as an old-school Disney fan, don't appreciate what's out there today, mainly because of what Michael Eisner has been attacking the animation studio these days, with one of the attacks being to stop making musical films, which was what brought Disney animation's fame.When this film came out on DVD, I thought it was going to suck. But when my mother rented this film for the kids, I first saw the film, as if to say ""Are these guys breaking something?"" I mean in my opinion, it's as if they slip this film through without Eisner noticing.Anyway, getting to the film, this is about Mickey, Donald, and Goofy, who applied to the Princess Minnie's castle as bumbling janitors with dreams of becoming Musketeers. It's captain won't allow it because Donald's a coward, Goofy's a doofus, and Mickey is too small. Of course Pete had a dream of his own, too: kidnap and stow away the princess and become king at the opera. At that time, the princess tells Pete to hire bodyguards for her as she's unsafe. Seeing the trio's clumsy antics, Pete hires Mickey, Donald, and Goofy as bodyguards, and...well you'll get the rest.Now, in my defense, there are a few flaws with this film: The plot is pretty predictable, some of the jokes fall flat, and usually too much dialogue is added in a few scenes. It seems that they spent a little too much time on this film.Having said that, there are a few pros as well. The film aims directly at kids, but adults can still get a few chuckles in this film. If you knew Goofy, you can still get a good laugh or two at him for his clumsy character. And the story doesn't drag too long; about 68 minutes.It seems that direct-to-video was the perfect choice for this film. Of course the real pro, as I said before, is that this film is a musical. There are five total songs in this movie, sung by the cast in this movie.

They gave it a thumbs up, and during one pay period, when I had some excess cash to spend, I splurged on a used copy.I liked what I saw, but it felt a little forced in the humor department.  BACKGROUND; Disney and Warner Brothers were bitter rivals in the 30s, 40s, and up through the 60s.  It wasn't until some bean conter at WB realized that WB could save money by re-issuing and re-editing their current crop of animation that WB's animation studios fell into dissuse as the division was all but shut down.  This left Disney and MGM, and MGM was investing more and more in musical spectacles.  This left Disney as the animation king (well, at least here in the US).As such Disney took some story styling cues from Warner Brothers and integrated them into their short films and features.  It worked.  The only problem is that Disney is not Warner.  Disney has matured and polished its animation storytelling styles since that time, but when this film came out there was still a lot of rough edges that needed to be smoothed out.Even so, the humor does deliver for those who like zingers in their toons.  Mickey, Donald and Goofy go through a G-rated retelling of Dumas' tale, and save the Queen and France at the end of the adventure.I liked it.  It was okay.

I'm normally not the kids animation type but I did enjoy ""The Three Musketeers"" which ranks up there in regards to direct-to-video Disney movies. I found that it was good for about ages 3 to 10.Mickey, Donald & Goofy dream of becoming Musketeers serving France. Until then, they work as janitors a job they're particularly ill suited to do. When Pete the Captain of the Musketeers plots to overthrow the French monarchy and put Pete into power. Mickey, Donald and Goofy must suddenly become Musketeers to help Princess Minnie from being taken prisoner and save France. There's a number of songs that use classic pieces as the basis and these are quite fun.The animation is fluid and more than a cut above most of the TV cartoons we see. While the designs of the characters are simpler, they have much more character than most of the standard Yugi-O good guys and bad guys. ""Three Musketeers"" really is a throw back to the ""Mickey & The Beanstock"" style cartoons that Disney made in the 40's. With winning direction and writing, ""Three Musketeers"" will provide solid family entertainment. The handsome backgrounds look terrific and the extras will keep kids engaged beyond the movie.I particularly liked ""Backstage Disney"" with a comical commentary from ""the cast"" (although it is scene specific)and ""The Many Hats of Mickey"" which takes a glimpse back through the 20th Century at Mickey Mouse's evolution with clips from cartoons of the past. We also get to see deleted scenes (most of which aren't finished and are simply line drawings to be filled in later by the animators and colored by the colorists). There's also an option to ""create"" your own opera in an interactive section. It's probably sometime the kids will play with one or two times.Overall, a very good cartoon for kids up to the tween years, ""The Three Musketeers"" has a lot of daring sword fights and enough swashbuckling adventure to keep tikes interested.
