Ivy (Abbey Lincoln)is a black maid to a well-to-do white family on Long Island well Ivy decides she wants to move into the city to further her education and to live amongst people like her self (black) the family just doesn't want Ivy to go they don't understand why she wants to go, they consider Ivy family... well as much as one can consider the Maid a part of your family. The family is made up of Carrol O' Conner, Beau Bridges, Nan Martin and Laurie Peters. The children soon realize that Abbey wants to leave because she wants to have a life or her own which includes a man. The son and daughter decide to ""hook"" Ivy up with Sidney Poitier who owns a trucks service that distributes for their Father's dept store. Sidney agrees begrudgingly to this because Beau has a way of ""convincing"" him (no spoilers here).It's a cute movie Abbey Lincoln is very stylish, shy yet smart as well and Sidney Poitier was clever, smooth, hip and does wonders with his expressions LOL. There is this scene where Beau Bridges says something pretty racist and I was thinking... ""Wow! did he just say that?"" but Sidney's face conveyed a pause... (like he took his measure of Beau to keep to himself for later) then moved smoothly along in the conversation. As a african american watching this movie it reminded me that there are so few movies out there that potrays black love in such a positive way and I know this was a old flix but it still was a surprising pleasurable find.  I didn't know what to expect but it will go on my classic favorite list of movies for sure.  I highly recommend it.Respectfully Reviewed",5,A wonderful movie about Black Love,1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,1751,"['movie', 'was', 'set', '60', '68', 'be', 'exact', 'had', 'music', 'one', 'typical', 'New', 'York', 'romance', 'flix', 'think', 'Barefoot', 'Park', 'Ivy', 'Abbey', 'Lincoln', 'black', 'maid', 'well-to-do', 'white', 'family', 'Long', 'Island', 'well', 'Ivy', 'move', 'city', 'further', 'education', 'live', 'amongst', 'people', 'self', 'black', 'family', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'Ivy', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'go', 'consider', 'Ivy', 'family', 'well', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'consider', 'Maid', 'part', 'family', 'family', 'made', 'Carrol', 'O', 'Conner', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Nan', 'Martin', 'Laurie', 'Peters', 'children', 'soon', 'realize', 'Abbey', 'leave', 'have', 'life', 'own', 'man', 'son', 'daughter', 'decide', 'hook', 'Ivy', 'up', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'who', 'trucks', 'service', 'Father', 'dept', 'store', 'Sidney', 'begrudgingly', 'Beau', 'way', 'convincing', 'spoilers', 'here', '.It', 'cute', 'movie', 'Abbey', 'Lincoln', 'very', 'stylish', 'shy', 'yet', 'smart', 'well', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'was', 'clever', 'smooth', 'hip', 'wonders', 'expressions', 'LOL', 'scene', 'where', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'something', 'pretty', 'racist', 'was', 'thinking', 'Wow', 'did', 'just', 'say', 'Sidney', 'face', 'conveyed', 'pause', 'took', 'measure', 'Beau', 'keep', 'later', 'then', 'moved', 'smoothly', 'along', 'conversation', 'african', 'american', 'watching', 'movie', 'reminded', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'movies', 'there', 'black', 'love', 'such', 'positive', 'way', 'know', 'was', 'old', 'flix', 'still', 'was', 'surprising', 'pleasurable', 'find', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'will', 'go', 'classic', 'favorite', 'list', 'movies', 'sure', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.Respectfully', 'Reviewed']",N/A
