Simmons ""HENDRIX""","[1, 12]",for me takashi has been on a steady decline in the last 3 yrs films like Izo and One Missed Call(wasn't bad) have really just tarnished his reputation as an over the top overly violent movie director and really thats why we like him. This movie is just bad for his standards not The Takashi that we know and love. Imprint for instance is one of his masterpieces Audition Ichi the Killer Dead or Alive Trilogy. Takashi used to have a way of giving a really deep  story line masked behind graphic images that only he could deliver and i hate to say it miike you lost your touch.If your a fan of early takashi you will be dissapointed in this trust me.,2,Takashi has left the building,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,649,"['takashi', 'been', 'steady', 'decline', 'last', '3', 'yrs', 'films', 'Izo', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'have', 'really', 'just', 'tarnished', 'reputation', 'top', 'overly', 'violent', 'movie', 'director', 'really', 'thats', 'why', 'like', 'movie', 'just', 'bad', 'standards', 'not', 'Takashi', 'know', 'love', 'Imprint', 'instance', 'one', 'masterpieces', 'Audition', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'Trilogy', 'Takashi', 'used', 'have', 'way', 'giving', 'really', 'deep', 'story', 'line', 'masked', 'graphic', 'images', 'only', 'could', 'deliver', 'i', 'hate', 'say', 'miike', 'lost', 'touch.If', 'fan', 'early', 'takashi', 'will', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'trust']",N/A

The action consists mainly of poses, extreme violence, and interrogation with the occasional tender moment between the two main characters.

It is even subtitled in English, although I'm not sure why, because I can't see that it would make any sense in any language.I thought this was going to be an artistic, dreamy, sensual, mysterious film. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. It is a one-time-only, head-scratching extravaganza that goes nowhere. There are hints that there are dark, disturbing things that are going on, and if the creative team behind this had taken those elements and made a compelling story out of this, they might have had a cult classic. But they didn't and they don't.I will be interested to see what other Amazon members have to say about this film, if in fact anyone else has purchased it.",1,Incomprehensible,1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,884,"['someone', 'deep', 'gay', 'fantasy', 'are', 'lucky', 'got', 'money', 'make', 'film', 'lucky', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'made', 'based', 'luck', 'favors', 'someone', 'willing', 'sleep', 'someone', 'else', 'even', 'subtitled', 'English', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'language.I', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'artistic', 'dreamy', 'sensual', 'mysterious', 'film', 'Wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'one-time-only', 'head-scratching', 'extravaganza', 'nowhere', 'are', 'hints', 'are', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'creative', 'team', 'had', 'taken', 'elements', 'made', 'compelling', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'cult', 'classic', 'did', ""n't"", ""don't.I"", 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'Amazon', 'members', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'fact', 'anyone', 'else', 'purchased']",N/A

But for Big Bang Love i havent had a movie of this nature really affect me the way this one did.  Incorporating violence and so many other aspects and putting it in such a small, enclosed area prison with all kinds of people.  Its only natural that all sorts of violence would erupt from this.  Something else also comes from it though a love however strange it maybe what ties this two men together.  But there bond for each grows throughout the movie and while not long running at 86 minutes.There is more than enough time for anyone to become attached and even other prisoners arent closed minded about the things that happen.  Some see it as a way of getting in better with key officials by ""doing"" whatever is necessary to make the bleak and dark conditions just a little bit better.  In the Big Bang Love grabbed me because it felt real to me and that the people involved were putting their all and every ounce of energy into to making something that get that attention and interest of many.

1112453,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000WZAE6S,Richard Ross,"[5, 6]","On the cover art for this DVD Takashi Miike declares that ""This is my masterpiece."" I hate to disagree with him but I think Audition remains his best film. Fortunately that film and this one have a lot in common. They both have brilliant uses of color and odd shot compositions designed to  make you uneasy and unsure of your surroundings. This film takes place in an all male prison. Two new inmates are admitted on the same day. Though strangers to each other both men have a lot in common. At some point in their lives they were  sexually abused and both men committed violent murders which landed them in jail. One is shy and vulnerable the other tough and aggressive. The more violent of the two finds himself beating up the guards and his cellmates as soon as he arrives. He also acts as protector for his new friend. The two men slowly open up to one another and reveal very little about their past instead choosing to talk about the possibility of getting out of prison and whether they would like to go to heaven or space. The violent man chooses space since heaven would have people in it and it has been his experience that people just depress and disappoint you. There is an attraction between the two men that is hinted at but we never know if they act on that impulse. What sets the plot in motion is when a murder is committed. The violent man lays dead while the shy man is on top of him with his hands around his neck. As the guards pull him off he freely admits that he did it. It would seem like a no brainer since the victim was obviously strangled to death and here is the suspect with his hands still attached to his throat. The mystery deepens since seemingly everyone in the prison had a motive for killing this man. It could have been any one of the dozens of men he beat up or even the warden who has his own painful reason for revenge against the man. An investigation follows which is very entertaining to watch. Miike employs flashbacks to the two men's youth and also the murders that landed them in jail.  He shows some scenes up to four times, sometimes from a different angle, but each time revealing a little more in context. Everything is answered in the end but until it is things are a bit confusing. In the excellent bonus features on Disc 2 the actors confess to not understanding the script after they initially read it and still admit some confusion as to what is really going on. There is also an interview with Miike included. This film like other Miike films reminds me of the work of David Lynch, both for their strong and unusual visual style, but mainly for the fact that no matter how hard you try to pay attention and catch every clue it still seems like things aren't adding up. This is a very strong effort from Miike and the DVD has some good bonus features that try to explain some of the meanings of the film.",3,Not his masterpiece but one of his better films,1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,2863,"['cover', 'art', 'DVD', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'masterpiece', 'hate', 'disagree', 'think', 'Audition', 'best', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'have', 'brilliant', 'uses', 'color', 'odd', 'shot', 'compositions', 'designed', 'make', 'uneasy', 'unsure', 'surroundings', 'film', 'place', 'male', 'prison', 'Two', 'new', 'inmates', 'are', 'admitted', 'same', 'day', 'strangers', 'other', 'men', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'point', 'lives', 'were', 'sexually', 'abused', 'men', 'committed', 'violent', 'murders', 'landed', 'jail', 'One', 'shy', 'vulnerable', 'other', 'tough', 'aggressive', 'more', 'violent', 'two', 'finds', 'beating', 'up', 'guards', 'cellmates', 'as', 'soon', 'also', 'protector', 'new', 'friend', 'two', 'men', 'slowly', 'open', 'up', 'one', 'reveal', 'very', 'little', 'past', 'instead', 'choosing', 'talk', 'possibility', 'getting', 'prison', 'would', 'like', 'go', 'heaven', 'space', 'violent', 'man', 'space', 'heaven', 'would', 'have', 'people', 'been', 'experience', 'people', 'just', 'depress', 'disappoint', 'attraction', 'two', 'men', 'hinted', 'never', 'know', 'act', 'impulse', 'What', 'plot', 'motion', 'when', 'murder', 'committed', 'violent', 'man', 'dead', 'shy', 'man', 'top', 'hands', 'neck', 'guards', 'pull', 'freely', 'did', 'would', 'seem', 'brainer', 'victim', 'was', 'obviously', 'strangled', 'death', 'here', 'suspect', 'hands', 'still', 'attached', 'throat', 'mystery', 'seemingly', 'everyone', 'prison', 'had', 'motive', 'killing', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'dozens', 'men', 'beat', 'up', 'even', 'warden', 'who', 'own', 'painful', 'reason', 'revenge', 'man', 'investigation', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Miike', 'flashbacks', 'two', 'men', 'youth', 'also', 'murders', 'landed', 'jail', 'scenes', 'four', 'times', 'sometimes', 'different', 'angle', 'time', 'revealing', 'little', 'more', 'context', 'Everything', 'answered', 'end', 'things', 'are', 'bit', 'confusing', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'features', 'Disc', '2', 'actors', 'confess', 'not', 'understanding', 'script', 'initially', 'read', 'still', 'admit', 'confusion', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'also', 'interview', 'Miike', 'included', 'film', 'other', 'Miike', 'films', 'work', 'David', 'Lynch', 'strong', 'unusual', 'visual', 'style', 'mainly', 'fact', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'pay', 'attention', 'catch', 'clue', 'still', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'adding', 'up', 'very', 'strong', 'effort', 'Miike', 'DVD', 'good', 'bonus', 'features', 'try', 'explain', 'meanings', 'film']",N/A
