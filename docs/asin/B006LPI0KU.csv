1517218,A2QJNRWM7VMI1X,B006LPI0KU,"Colston ""Colston""","[19, 28]","If there is one reason to own this DVD, it is Dessay.  A natural query is ""Why would Dessay get involved in a production like this?""  Seeing Dessay in Met's La Traviata recently (HD theatres) inspired me to buy the present DVD, which is the only Violetta available with Dessay.  We see a vivacious forty-year-old face on a lithe twenty-year-old frame.  It is a pleasure.  Her performance brought back memories of watching Callas as Cio Cio San, and Moffo as Lucia more than half a century ago.  Callas, Moffo, and Dessay can now be spoken in the same breath.What a contrast!  This Virgin version is embedded in a third-rate setting (using that word loosely, sorry) and choreography.  It is impossible for anyone, including Dessay, to inspire her compatriots, who at best are indifferent, and at worse lacks imagination.  These singers performed in their street clothes. Annina even brought along her newspaper to keep her from being bored.  She needed it at the beginning of Act 1 (bit of sarcasm here).  Georgio Germont looks more like Alfredo's little brother than his father.  A little make up would have helped.  I came away with the feeling that these so-called professional artists simply didn't give a damn.Verdi would not recognize this opera.  Conclusion:  Dessay = 5 stars;  others = 1 star. Average = 3 starsAs gifted as Dessay is, with her voice, beauty, and unrivaled acting talent, she would have been an automatic all-time prima donna.  She virtually threw that away by repeatedly appearing in forgetable third-rate productions, like the present one.

1517226,A9ZQM87NYYQTB,B006LPI0KU,S. Wells,"[23, 31]","Natalie Dessay is an artist whom I admire greatly for her singing, acting, intelligence and musicianship.  This performance is ample reason why.  Here is a well-sung and compelling acted performance of one of opera's more challenging roles.  At times I thought her characterization was a bit edgy - on the verge in a manner more suited to Lucia than to Violetta - but, still, it's a thoughtful and valid portrayal.  Her singing is technically brilliant (as in ""Sempre libera"") and deeply moving (""Addio del passato"") where needed.  I was particularly pleased that she takes both verses of both her arias.  The last several performances of I've seen in the theatre have used these erstwhile traditional cuts.Miss Dessay is well-matched in the Alfredo of Charles Castronovo.  He has a pleasing lyric voice and shows a commendable empathy for a not altogether sympathetic character.  His singing is tasteful and involved, though he does come close to losing the high C at the end of his second act cabaletta.The most serious drawback to this performance is the Giorgio Germont of Ludovic Tezier.  To my ears, at least, his voice is dry and colourless and his technique a bit dicey.  Add to this that he shows about as much emotion as if he were singing listings from the telephone directory and you'll understand the damage he does in the great second act scena with Violetta.  He's no better in his briefer appearances later in the opera.Even the comprimarios are a pretty sorry lot.  It's obvious why these persons are singing with the principals and not as the principals.  Perhaps Mr. Tezier would have been better with them.The updated setting adds nothing to the work and detracts slightly from it.  I'd like the opera to be about persons who are a bit more sophisticated than the bottle-chugging partiers in the first scenes of the first and second acts.  The pointless, though pleasant, choruses of gypsies and matadors in Act 2, Scene 2 seem even more pointless than usual.  Perhaps worst is Violetta's standing-up death, followed by a little stroll across the stage after she's been pronounced dead.On the whole, I would recommend this only for Miss Dessay's Violetta with some additional enjoyment from Mr Castronovo's Alfredo.  As a first, or only, DVD of this opera, I'd go with the Georg Solti version from Covent Garden.",3,Buy this for Dessay,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,2332,"['Natalie', 'Dessay', 'artist', 'whom', 'admire', 'greatly', 'singing', 'acting', 'intelligence', 'musicianship', 'performance', 'ample', 'reason', 'why', 'Here', 'well-sung', 'compelling', 'acted', 'performance', 'one', 'opera', 'more', 'challenging', 'roles', 'times', 'thought', 'characterization', 'was', 'bit', 'edgy', 'verge', 'manner', 'more', 'suited', 'Lucia', 'Violetta', 'still', 'thoughtful', 'valid', 'portrayal', 'singing', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'Sempre', 'libera', 'deeply', 'moving', 'Addio', 'del', 'passato', 'where', 'needed', 'was', 'particularly', 'pleased', 'verses', 'arias', 'last', 'several', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'theatre', 'have', 'used', 'erstwhile', 'traditional', 'cuts.Miss', 'Dessay', 'well-matched', 'Alfredo', 'Charles', 'Castronovo', 'pleasing', 'lyric', 'voice', 'commendable', 'empathy', 'not', 'altogether', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'singing', 'tasteful', 'involved', 'come', 'close', 'losing', 'high', 'C', 'end', 'second', 'act', 'most', 'serious', 'drawback', 'performance', 'Giorgio', 'Germont', 'Ludovic', 'Tezier', 'ears', 'least', 'voice', 'dry', 'colourless', 'technique', 'bit', 'dicey', 'Add', 'as', 'much', 'emotion', 'were', 'singing', 'listings', 'telephone', 'directory', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'damage', 'great', 'second', 'act', 'scena', 'Violetta', 'better', 'briefer', 'appearances', 'later', 'opera.Even', 'comprimarios', 'are', 'pretty', 'sorry', 'lot', 'obvious', 'why', 'persons', 'are', 'singing', 'principals', 'not', 'principals', 'Perhaps', 'Mr.', 'Tezier', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'them.The', 'updated', 'setting', 'nothing', 'work', 'detracts', 'slightly', ""'d"", 'like', 'opera', 'be', 'persons', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'bottle-chugging', 'partiers', 'first', 'scenes', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'pointless', 'pleasant', 'choruses', 'gypsies', 'matadors', 'Act', '2', 'Scene', '2', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'pointless', 'usual', 'Perhaps', 'worst', 'Violetta', 'standing-up', 'death', 'followed', 'little', 'stroll', 'stage', 'been', 'pronounced', 'whole', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'Miss', 'Dessay', 'Violetta', 'additional', 'enjoyment', 'Mr', 'Castronovo', 'Alfredo', 'first', 'only', 'DVD', 'opera', ""'d"", 'go', 'Georg', 'Solti', 'version', 'Covent', 'Garden']",Verdi: La Traviata
1517227,A32IDJ16KR13SM,B006LPI0KU,W. J. Yoder,"[2, 6]","I find this production wonderul singing and wonderful orchestral playing, but totally unconvincing.  Although I love Natalie Dessay's performances, her Violetta falls short.  Dessay is just too innocent, cute and girlish to be convincing. I simply can't see her being a courtesan, or a call girl, or whatever she's supposed to be in this production.  And therein lies the problem with me:  This ""Traviata"" just didn't do the trick.  It was too modern and too sparsely conceived.  ""Traviata"" calls for brilliant salon scenes and gorgeous costumes of the Nineteenth Century Parisian variety.Dessay's portrayal of Violetta's death in Act III, however, was incredibly dramatic acting.  The best I've ever seen.Ludovic Tezier is another matter.  To me he can't act his way through anything.
