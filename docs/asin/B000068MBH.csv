In fact, typing the name of any Tim Allen film comes with a sharp mix of cringe and smile, since while none of his films are typically `good' films, they are all a lot of fun to watch.  `Joe Somebody' is no exception.  It is generic and predictable and sits nice and easy on the `family friendly' line, but it's respectably all of those things.  It understands its audience and so it serves up what that audience requires, but it does so with the extra `something'; that something being Tim Allen.  Allen plays the `everyman' with ease (a role he could take on in his sleep) and so he elevates the standard material by making it warm and inviting and `lived in'.

Anyway, for what it was intended to be, this movie is excellent. For those of you out there that loved the movie, Return to Me, in spite of critics ripping it apart, Joe Somebody is in the same category. Tim Allen gives his absolute most touching performance as a middle aged man in a terrible identity crisis. His pain seems very very real, and his childlike response to rising popularity makes him even more lovable than if he began to get cocky.The title of the film is the point of the movie, who we are is not what other people think about us. Joe is very invisible in the beginning and suffering from rejection. His artsy, image conscious wife has left him to pursue, what else, her own desires for fame, and fleeting excitement. His co-workers don't know his name although he's worked for his company for ten years. The final straw is when an immature employee beats him up in the company parking lot when Joe tries to stand up for his rights.Things change when he's visited by the company health counselor, who is as cute as a button and could replace Meg Ryan in a heartbeat. She asks Joe what he wants in a casual conversation, and from there Joe begins to change his life. The rest of the movie questions whether the changes are for the better. Although the movie is predictable, we really wouldn't want it to turn out any other way.Jim Belushi is as good in this movie as he was in Return to Me. Here he is an aged, out of work, Steven Seagal type character who Tim Allen enlists to help him get into shape for a rematch with his arch nemesis at work. The scenes are the best in the movie and worth the price alone. Most people don't know the extent of Belushi's martial arts background but it certainly shows here and he fits perfectly into his role. Tim Allen has never played a more sympathetic creature than he does here, and one wonders if he didn't bring some of the pain from his own life into the role.The old saying is, don't judge a book by it's cover, and I have to say that for this DVD. The cover is very misleading, especially with the leading lady leaning all over Joe - who stands like Conan the Barbarian. Her character is not like this at all - she's much classier and the cover art is really weird. Her character is also explored in depth, and the story is as much hers as it is Joe's. Watching Joe deal with his mid-life crisis causes many others in the film to re-evaulate their own right along with him.For those of you who loved Return to Me, another predictable movie, for the fact that endless quirky wonderful performances surrounded the leads and complimented them beautifully, then Joe Somebody is for you. The film is a wonderful exploration of true friendship, a fulfilling life, and the pursuit of happiness.",5,Tim Allen's most endearing performance,1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,2876,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hard', 'movie', 'taken', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'expecting', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'film', 'Anyway', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'movie', 'excellent', 'loved', 'movie', 'Return', 'Me', 'spite', 'critics', 'ripping', 'apart', 'Joe', 'Somebody', 'same', 'category', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'absolute', 'most', 'touching', 'performance', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'terrible', 'identity', 'crisis', 'pain', 'very', 'very', 'real', 'childlike', 'response', 'rising', 'popularity', 'even', 'more', 'lovable', 'began', 'get', 'cocky.The', 'title', 'film', 'point', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'Joe', 'very', 'invisible', 'beginning', 'suffering', 'rejection', 'artsy', 'image', 'conscious', 'wife', 'left', 'pursue', 'what', 'else', 'own', 'desires', 'fame', 'fleeting', 'excitement', 'co-workers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'worked', 'company', 'ten', 'years', 'final', 'straw', 'when', 'immature', 'employee', 'beats', 'up', 'company', 'parking', 'lot', 'when', 'Joe', 'stand', 'up', 'rights.Things', 'change', 'when', 'visited', 'company', 'health', 'counselor', 'who', 'as', 'cute', 'button', 'could', 'replace', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'heartbeat', 'Joe', 'what', 'casual', 'conversation', 'Joe', 'change', 'life', 'rest', 'movie', 'questions', 'changes', 'are', 'better', 'movie', 'predictable', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'turn', 'out', 'other', 'way.Jim', 'Belushi', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'Return', 'Me', 'Here', 'aged', 'work', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'type', 'character', 'who', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'help', 'get', 'shape', 'rematch', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'work', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'price', 'alone', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'extent', 'Belushi', 'martial', 'arts', 'background', 'certainly', 'here', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'never', 'played', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'creature', 'here', 'one', 'wonders', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'pain', 'own', 'life', 'role.The', 'old', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'have', 'say', 'DVD', 'cover', 'very', 'misleading', 'especially', 'leading', 'lady', 'leaning', 'Joe', 'who', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'character', 'not', 'much', 'classier', 'cover', 'art', 'really', 'weird', 'character', 'also', 'explored', 'depth', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'hers', 'Joe', 'Watching', 'Joe', 'deal', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'causes', 'many', 'others', 'film', 're-evaulate', 'own', 'right', 'him.For', 'who', 'loved', 'Return', 'Me', 'predictable', 'movie', 'fact', 'endless', 'quirky', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'surrounded', 'leads', 'complimented', 'beautifully', 'then', 'Joe', 'Somebody', 'film', 'wonderful', 'exploration', 'true', 'friendship', 'fulfilling', 'life', 'pursuit', 'happiness']",N/A

""Joe Somebody"" is a good romantic comedy that has a message I'm sure we can all agree on ""Be Yourself""! The cast seems to be enjoying themselves and that carries over on to the viewer. I don't think Tim Allen has ever been more likable and the romantic chemistry between him and quirky cutie Julie Bowen is believable.Jim Belushi is very amusing as a ""has been"" action hero star turned boozer Karate instructor, so the next time you wake up in one of those ""I don't want to do anything moods"" It might be time to watch ""Joe Somebody"" It just might have the inspirational fluff you need! lol!
