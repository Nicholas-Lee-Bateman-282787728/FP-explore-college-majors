1646790,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,B00CFK5HBU,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[1, 1]","The dust jacket shows that this documentary was originally made for the History channel/A&E; Networks and has now been released in a DVD version.If you are one of millions that enjoyed watching Godfather, Scarface, Sopranos or the variousother dramatizations of the ""Mafia"", then you may be interested in this documentary.  Thisis mostly one man's story, and that man is Sonny Franzese, whose father was in the New YorkColombo family.  Despite his father hoping that he'd pursue a more honest career, the acorndidn't fall far from the tree as the saying goes, and Franzese ended up becoming a""regimentcapo"" or captain for the Colombo family during the late-golden years for the New Yorkmob families.  Franzese is one of the very few ""made"" men who (he says) exited organized crimewithout leaving in a coffin, dying in prison or being in the witness protection program.Essentially how that happened was a combination of favorable circumstances: 1. Toward the endof his career, a pair of prosecutors whose names you might recognize: Rudy Giuliani and MichaelChertoff began a string of major trials under the RICO act, putting away much of the leadershipof the New York families.  2.  Having found a new and very lucrative way to steal money that wassupposed to go to the US government as taxes, Franzese had become very high-profile.  Hesensed that if he didn't get out of his position, some jealous rival might soon take him outwith a bullet.  3.  He got married and says his wife (and kids) were a good influence on him.So he took a plea-bargain rather than fight a case in court, served 8 years in prison, and whenhe got out, made it known that he was finished with that life.This film consists mostly of interviews with him regarding what it was like entering La CosaNostra, what it was like being a foot soldier, being a captain, and what he saw of howthe bosses of the New York families operated.  These are supplemented occasionally bybrief interviews with Chertoff regarding the history of the US government's response(from almost non-existent, to extremely aggressive, and now back to relatively passiveagain, as attention got diverted by foreign terrorism) and by interviews with one othermob-related figure (whose name I forgot) in part corroborating Franzese's story and inpart offering his own supplementary views, and by some still footage of various majormoments in NYC mob history: photos of bosses both living and dead, etc.  The film isloosely organized into chapters each one dealing with a particular sub-topic.  The transitionsbetween chapters are a little cheesy, generally using a new title which then gets ablood-spatter treatment.One can sense what still seems to be an ambivalence in Franzese, part of him still seemingproud of how successful he had been at earning a lot of money and never being successfullyprosecuted for it, and how he never ""ratted"" on other anyone else to the ""Feds""; yet he alsonow describes his former life as ""evil"".  He issues some cautionary warnings to young peoplewho may see movies like The Sopranos or the Godfather series as ""glamorous"", and to anybusiness people who might consider accepting an ""offer"" from someone in organized crime.I wish his warnings had been a little stronger, but they are there.This hardly tells the whole story of ""La Cosa Nostra"" in the US; it's almost solely focusedon the New York families in the 1970's and 1980's, and it does not cover all of the activitiesthey engaged in to make money, nor does it go into detail about how violent and ruthless theyoften were.  Nevertheless it's a good counterbalance to many of the fictionalized storieswhich have been immensely popular.  For anyone interested in organized crime in the US thisdocumentary is worth a viewing.",4,An Interesting Documentary,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,3748,"['dust', 'jacket', 'documentary', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'History', 'channel/A', 'E', 'Networks', 'now', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'version.If', 'are', 'one', 'millions', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Godfather', 'Scarface', 'Sopranos', 'variousother', 'dramatizations', 'Mafia', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'documentary', 'Thisis', 'mostly', 'one', 'man', 'story', 'man', 'Sonny', 'Franzese', 'father', 'was', 'New', 'YorkColombo', 'family', 'father', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'pursue', 'more', 'honest', 'career', 'acorndid', ""n't"", 'fall', 'far', 'tree', 'saying', 'Franzese', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'regimentcapo', 'captain', 'Colombo', 'family', 'late-golden', 'years', 'New', 'Yorkmob', 'families', 'Franzese', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'made', 'men', 'who', 'exited', 'organized', 'crimewithout', 'leaving', 'coffin', 'dying', 'prison', 'being', 'witness', 'protection', 'program.Essentially', 'how', 'happened', 'was', 'combination', 'favorable', 'circumstances', '1', 'Toward', 'endof', 'career', 'pair', 'prosecutors', 'names', 'might', 'recognize', 'Rudy', 'Giuliani', 'MichaelChertoff', 'began', 'string', 'major', 'trials', 'RICO', 'act', 'putting', 'away', 'much', 'leadershipof', 'New', 'York', 'families', '2', 'Having', 'found', 'new', 'very', 'lucrative', 'way', 'steal', 'money', 'wassupposed', 'go', 'US', 'government', 'taxes', 'Franzese', 'had', 'become', 'very', 'high-profile', 'Hesensed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'position', 'jealous', 'rival', 'might', 'soon', 'take', 'outwith', 'bullet', '3', 'got', 'married', 'wife', 'kids', 'were', 'good', 'influence', 'him.So', 'took', 'plea-bargain', 'rather', 'fight', 'case', 'court', 'served', '8', 'years', 'prison', 'whenhe', 'got', 'out', 'made', 'known', 'was', 'finished', 'life.This', 'film', 'mostly', 'interviews', 'regarding', 'what', 'was', 'entering', 'La', 'CosaNostra', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'foot', 'soldier', 'being', 'captain', 'what', 'saw', 'howthe', 'bosses', 'New', 'York', 'families', 'operated', 'are', 'supplemented', 'occasionally', 'bybrief', 'interviews', 'Chertoff', 'regarding', 'history', 'US', 'government', 'response', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'extremely', 'aggressive', 'now', 'back', 'relatively', 'passiveagain', 'attention', 'got', 'diverted', 'foreign', 'terrorism', 'interviews', 'one', 'othermob-related', 'figure', 'name', 'forgot', 'part', 'corroborating', 'Franzese', 'story', 'inpart', 'offering', 'own', 'supplementary', 'views', 'still', 'footage', 'various', 'majormoments', 'NYC', 'mob', 'history', 'photos', 'bosses', 'living', 'dead', 'etc', 'film', 'isloosely', 'organized', 'chapters', 'one', 'dealing', 'particular', 'sub-topic', 'transitionsbetween', 'chapters', 'are', 'little', 'cheesy', 'generally', 'using', 'new', 'title', 'then', 'ablood-spatter', 'treatment.One', 'can', 'sense', 'what', 'still', 'be', 'ambivalence', 'Franzese', 'part', 'still', 'seemingproud', 'how', 'successful', 'had', 'been', 'earning', 'lot', 'money', 'never', 'being', 'successfullyprosecuted', 'how', 'never', 'ratted', 'other', 'anyone', 'else', 'Feds', 'former', 'life', 'evil', 'issues', 'cautionary', 'warnings', 'young', 'peoplewho', 'may', 'see', 'movies', 'Sopranos', 'Godfather', 'series', 'glamorous', 'anybusiness', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'consider', 'accepting', 'offer', 'someone', 'organized', 'crime.I', 'wish', 'warnings', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'stronger', 'are', 'there.This', 'hardly', 'whole', 'story', 'La', 'Cosa', 'Nostra', 'US', 'almost', 'solely', 'focusedon', 'New', 'York', 'families', '1970', '1980', 'not', 'cover', 'activitiesthey', 'engaged', 'make', 'money', 'go', 'detail', 'how', 'violent', 'ruthless', 'theyoften', 'were', 'Nevertheless', 'good', 'counterbalance', 'many', 'fictionalized', 'storieswhich', 'have', 'been', 'immensely', 'popular', 'anyone', 'interested', 'organized', 'crime', 'US', 'thisdocumentary', 'viewing']",Definitive Guide To The Mob

1646792,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00CFK5HBU,Mark Turner,"[4, 4]","When I was in high school I took a sudden interest in all things mob related. I read book after book beginning with THE VALACHI PAPERS. For a while it held my interest culminating with finally seeing the film and reading the book THE GODFATHER. While that movie is still one of the best ever made, my interests have dwindled a bit. But when something comes along I still make a point of watching whether it's a TV documentary or something like this new DVD release.This new DVD first appeared on The History Channel a while back. While it purports to be the definitive guide, it actually gives some of the basics as seen through the eyes of one man, Michael Franzese. The DVD tells the story of how he was the son of a man already involved with the Mafia and how he eventually approached his father about joining himself.Franzese is a well dressed, successful looking man in the film. He presents himself well but as it progresses he makes it clear that men like him specialize in their appearance. In looking professional and respectful they are less likely to be thought of as anything but. It's only after they have you hooked in one scheme or another that you realize who you are dealing with.His story spells out the ceremony that each person takes to become a full fledged member of the Mob. It's the same story we've heard before with holding the burning paper and swearing allegiance to the Mob with the penalty of death should you talk. This was in induction ceremony and now he must become a money earner for the organization.Franzese discusses the set up of the Mob, how they have leaders and captains and low level members who all bring cash in and distribute it up the pipeline. If you're caught holding back or not paying your dues chances are you won't be in business or alive for long. Each person gets his cut and in return each member has various forms of protection or help passed along to them.What Franzese did when he became a member was to find new ways for the Mob to make money. One scam he came up with brought in so much money that it rivaled all other forms. It also brought the attention of the FBI. Through various pieces of evidence they had a solid case against him and he plea bargained for a lesser sentence. Then he did something no one else had ever done: he walked away from the Mob.To date no one before or since has walked away. Those that have passed along detailed information (which he refused to do) have either come up missing or found themselves in witness protection. Franzese chose not to become involved with the latter, taking his chances on the streets but making a point to be careful and not to return to his early stomping grounds. While he may give information here in this film it's nothing that isn't well known to begin with. Names that he names are those that are either dead or that have been written about before.For someone wanting to know how the Mob works, the small details of how it operates and what is involved in being associated with them this is a nice introduction. You may see how wealthy being involved is but at the same time you find out just how bloodthirsty they can be. A simple mistake can cost you your life. Still photographs and news footage of various high level Mob bosses are seen throughout here.Though the life of a Mob member appears glamorous at times the reality of staying one step ahead of the law while trying to watch your back with your cohorts would be something that I would think would make you steer clear of having ambitions to join. That along with the fact that you must be asked in should make it easy to avoid. In the end if you want a starting point to see what the Mob is all about this DVD is a good jumping point.",3,THE STORY OF ONE MOBSTER,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,3721,"['When', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'took', 'sudden', 'interest', 'things', 'mob', 'related', 'read', 'book', 'book', 'beginning', 'THE', 'VALACHI', 'PAPERS', 'while', 'held', 'interest', 'culminating', 'finally', 'seeing', 'film', 'reading', 'book', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'movie', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'interests', 'have', 'dwindled', 'bit', 'when', 'something', 'still', 'make', 'point', 'watching', 'TV', 'documentary', 'something', 'new', 'DVD', 'new', 'DVD', 'first', 'appeared', 'History', 'Channel', 'while', 'back', 'be', 'definitive', 'guide', 'actually', 'basics', 'seen', 'eyes', 'one', 'man', 'Michael', 'Franzese', 'DVD', 'story', 'how', 'was', 'son', 'man', 'already', 'involved', 'Mafia', 'how', 'eventually', 'approached', 'father', 'joining', 'himself.Franzese', 'well', 'dressed', 'successful', 'looking', 'man', 'film', 'well', 'clear', 'men', 'specialize', 'appearance', 'looking', 'professional', 'respectful', 'are', 'less', 'likely', 'be', 'thought', 'anything', 'only', 'have', 'hooked', 'one', 'scheme', 'realize', 'who', 'are', 'dealing', 'with.His', 'story', 'spells', 'out', 'ceremony', 'person', 'become', 'full', 'fledged', 'member', 'Mob', 'same', 'story', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'holding', 'burning', 'paper', 'swearing', 'allegiance', 'Mob', 'penalty', 'death', 'should', 'talk', 'was', 'induction', 'ceremony', 'now', 'must', 'become', 'money', 'earner', 'organization.Franzese', 'set', 'Mob', 'how', 'have', 'leaders', 'captains', 'low', 'level', 'members', 'who', 'bring', 'cash', 'distribute', 'up', 'pipeline', ""'re"", 'caught', 'holding', 'back', 'not', 'paying', 'dues', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'business', 'alive', 'long', 'person', 'cut', 'return', 'member', 'various', 'forms', 'protection', 'help', 'passed', 'them.What', 'Franzese', 'did', 'when', 'became', 'member', 'was', 'find', 'new', 'ways', 'Mob', 'make', 'money', 'One', 'scam', 'came', 'up', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'rivaled', 'other', 'forms', 'also', 'brought', 'attention', 'FBI', 'various', 'pieces', 'evidence', 'had', 'solid', 'case', 'plea', 'bargained', 'lesser', 'sentence', 'Then', 'did', 'something', 'one', 'else', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'walked', 'away', 'Mob.To', 'date', 'one', 'before', 'walked', 'away', 'have', 'passed', 'detailed', 'information', 'refused', 'do', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'missing', 'found', 'witness', 'protection', 'Franzese', 'chose', 'not', 'become', 'involved', 'latter', 'taking', 'chances', 'streets', 'making', 'point', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'return', 'early', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'may', 'give', 'information', 'here', 'film', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'well', 'known', 'begin', 'Names', 'names', 'are', 'are', 'dead', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'before.For', 'someone', 'wanting', 'know', 'how', 'Mob', 'works', 'small', 'details', 'how', 'what', 'involved', 'being', 'associated', 'nice', 'introduction', 'may', 'see', 'how', 'wealthy', 'being', 'involved', 'same', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'bloodthirsty', 'can', 'be', 'simple', 'mistake', 'can', 'cost', 'life', 'Still', 'photographs', 'news', 'footage', 'various', 'high', 'level', 'Mob', 'bosses', 'are', 'seen', 'life', 'Mob', 'member', 'glamorous', 'times', 'reality', 'staying', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'law', 'trying', 'watch', 'back', 'cohorts', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'steer', 'clear', 'having', 'ambitions', 'join', 'fact', 'must', 'be', 'asked', 'should', 'make', 'easy', 'avoid', 'end', 'want', 'starting', 'point', 'see', 'what', 'Mob', 'DVD', 'good', 'jumping', 'point']",Definitive Guide To The Mob

He didn't research La Cosa Nostra.  He WAS La Cosa Nostra.  Probably one of the smartest, craftiest--luckiest-- mobsters of all time, Michael Franzese delivers the goods.  He tells it like it was, or like he saw it to be.Complementing Franzese are a group of well-known experts on the Mob, who speak to other details of La Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian Mafia, etc.If you love anything to do with the American Mob, this documentary is a MUST-SEE.  It is well-done, informative, and rings authentic all the way through.  You might not like who Franzese used to be, but you will love what he has to say.Do yourself a favor and check out these books as well:1) Cosa Nostra by John Dickie2) Five Families by Selwyn Raab3) Gaspipe by Philip Carlo4) Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi5) Underboss by Peter Maas and Sammy &#34;The Bull&#34; Gravano6) The Ice Man by Philip Carlo7) Made Men: The True Rise-and-Fall Story of a New Jersey Mob Family by Greg B.
