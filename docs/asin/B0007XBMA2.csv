I had to spend my points, and get SOMETHING because I was not going to let all that code entering go to waste!So a while later I finally decide to watch it, and just before I start the first disc I mentioned this to my mom.  She says that I loved this show when I was little.  I personally don't remember it, but ok, I believe her,  but I'm still not expecting much from this oh, so 80s looking show.After starting though, I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the banter between David and Maddie.  They are both hilarious in their biting, witty sarcasm.  And once they started referring to the fact that they are in fact on a tv show, and this might be a little risque considering they're not on cable, etc, they truly won me over.  Now I'm looking forward to getting the rest and listening to them talk their way out of more trouble and into more cases.  And the only time the fact that it was filmed in the 80's stood out was when I paid attention to the wardrobe.  Hoo, boy I can't imagine many workplaces now letting Maddie wear those low v cut blouses!",5,Surprised by how much I enjoyed it!,1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,1196,"['got', 'dvd', 'order', 'use', 'up', 'points', 'promotion', 'soft', 'drink', 'company', 'had', 'going', 'while', 'ago', 'was', 'ending', 'had', 'spend', 'points', 'get', 'SOMETHING', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'let', 'code', 'entering', 'go', 'waste', 'So', 'while', 'later', 'finally', 'decide', 'watch', 'just', 'start', 'first', 'disc', 'mentioned', 'mom', 'loved', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ok', 'believe', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'oh', 'so', '80s', 'looking', 'show.After', 'starting', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'banter', 'David', 'Maddie', 'are', 'hilarious', 'biting', 'witty', 'sarcasm', 'once', 'started', 'referring', 'fact', 'are', 'fact', 'tv', 'show', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'risque', 'considering', ""'re"", 'not', 'cable', 'etc', 'truly', 'won', 'Now', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'rest', 'listening', 'talk', 'way', 'more', 'trouble', 'more', 'cases', 'only', 'time', 'fact', 'was', 'filmed', '80', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'when', 'paid', 'attention', 'wardrobe', 'Hoo', 'boy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'many', 'workplaces', 'now', 'letting', 'Maddie', 'low', 'v', 'cut']",Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2

Moonlighting became famous for that, as well as other bizarre but interesting and amusing behaviors from the leads and the agency staff.At its worst, in the last couple of seasons, Moonlighting became brooding and somewhat depressing. Of course, as with many shows like this, the never released sexual tension between the male and female leads (David and Maddie) was what drove the show. The show ""Jumped the Shark"" at the same time the writers made the mistake of letting David jump Maddie.

893453,A2VDN6OJOIY74W,B0007XBMA2,"B. Sloane ""dotalbon""","[1, 2]","Twenty years down the road, here's how Moonlighting holds up:Brilliantly.Who would have thought that Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd, essentially playing themselves, would have fallen so easily into the modern-day Nick-and-Nora routines created for them by an amazing stable of writers?  Yet they did, and the writing is a big reason why.  Alternating goofball antics, look-arent-we-silly scenes with truly moving ones, the Moonlighting creative team made Maddie Hayes and David Addison one of the great showbiz couples.Not everything worked.  The pastiche episodes, such as the homage to Taming of the Shrew and the black-and-white noir tribute, flirt with brilliance, and one is indebted to Caron and Co. for being so audacious as to try such innovative stuff at all.  Some of the self-consciously cute bits -- reading fan mail, talking to the camera -- get a wee bit tiresome, but once Maddie and David get back into the whirl of their latest case, it's all good again.Others have noted that the series went downhill quickly because of Caron's unwillingness to adhere to network budgets and timetables,  Shepherd's and Willis' egos, etc.  In later seasons, Allyce Beasley and Curtis Armstrong carried many episodes virtually alone, and while both were charming in small doses, they reached overkill quickly.  More critically, although the sexual teasing between Maddie and David was a powerful force in the show, Caron and the writers didn't know how to keep them apart forever.  Once David/Maddie finally hooked up, everything REALLY became problematic, starting with that famous seduction scene as Maddie/David knock over furniture to get to each other -- at the time, Moonlighting fans were uncomfortably aware that Shepherd was pregnant with twins during all that knockabout filming!  Then Caron and Co. really didn't know what to do with their characters, introducing one weird plot twist after another to reconcile the Maddie/David situation, all the while relegating the mysteries to the background.And we fans just sighed and waited for the end, which wasn't long.But the glory of the series is probably enhanced by its brevity.  For its first three seasons, this was the best show on television.  And watching it now, you'll be amazed at how the writing and directing match the best of what's on contemporary TV,  minus the tons-of-violence that modern tastes demand in such shows -- violence which would, in the case of Moonlighting, have merely gotten in the way of much more interesting goings-on.",5,Some of the best TV writing ever,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,2513,"['Twenty', 'years', 'road', 'here', 'how', 'Moonlighting', 'up', 'Brilliantly.Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'essentially', 'playing', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'so', 'easily', 'modern-day', 'Nick-and-Nora', 'routines', 'created', 'amazing', 'stable', 'writers', 'did', 'writing', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'Alternating', 'goofball', 'antics', 'look-arent-we-silly', 'scenes', 'truly', 'moving', 'ones', 'Moonlighting', 'creative', 'team', 'made', 'Maddie', 'Hayes', 'David', 'Addison', 'one', 'great', 'showbiz', 'couples.Not', 'everything', 'worked', 'pastiche', 'episodes', 'such', 'homage', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'black-and-white', 'noir', 'tribute', 'flirt', 'brilliance', 'one', 'indebted', 'Caron', 'Co.', 'being', 'so', 'audacious', 'try', 'such', 'innovative', 'stuff', 'self-consciously', 'cute', 'bits', 'reading', 'fan', 'mail', 'talking', 'camera', 'get', 'wee', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'once', 'Maddie', 'David', 'get', 'back', 'whirl', 'latest', 'case', 'good', 'again.Others', 'have', 'noted', 'series', 'went', 'downhill', 'quickly', 'Caron', 'unwillingness', 'adhere', 'network', 'budgets', 'timetables', 'Shepherd', 'Willis', 'egos', 'etc', 'later', 'seasons', 'Allyce', 'Beasley', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'carried', 'many', 'episodes', 'virtually', 'alone', 'were', 'charming', 'small', 'doses', 'reached', 'overkill', 'quickly', 'More', 'critically', 'sexual', 'teasing', 'Maddie', 'David', 'was', 'powerful', 'force', 'show', 'Caron', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'keep', 'apart', 'forever', 'Once', 'David/Maddie', 'finally', 'hooked', 'up', 'everything', 'REALLY', 'became', 'problematic', 'starting', 'famous', 'seduction', 'scene', 'Maddie/David', 'knock', 'furniture', 'get', 'other', 'time', 'Moonlighting', 'fans', 'were', 'uncomfortably', 'aware', 'Shepherd', 'was', 'pregnant', 'twins', 'knockabout', 'filming', 'Then', 'Caron', 'Co.', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'characters', 'introducing', 'one', 'weird', 'plot', 'twist', 'reconcile', 'Maddie/David', 'situation', 'while', 'relegating', 'mysteries', 'background.And', 'fans', 'just', 'sighed', 'waited', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'long.But', 'glory', 'series', 'probably', 'enhanced', 'brevity', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'watching', 'now', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'writing', 'directing', 'match', 'best', 'what', 'contemporary', 'TV', 'tons-of-violence', 'modern', 'tastes', 'demand', 'such', 'shows', 'violence', 'would', 'case', 'Moonlighting', 'have', 'merely', 'gotten', 'way', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'goings-on']",Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2

893455,A3J1POADBGJA1G,B0007XBMA2,Christopher Francis,"[11, 12]","I am going to cut and paste a quote from Sharon, another reviewer whose review appears below, because she perfectly sums up my feelings on a particular issue...  My own comments will follow.""'Lady in the Iron Mask' had one of the classic chase scenes of all time. Originally during that scene, the music being played is ""The William Tell Overture"" ( otherwise known as the Hopalong Cassidy theme ). Perfectly timed, the scene was hilarious. They had some other music playing and I know it sounds stupid, but it wasn't as funny.""Now I remember reading several places that this box set wasn't released a few years ago because it seemed like it was going to be nearly impossible to get all the music rights/clearances and the show's creator wouldn't allow it to be released without the original music.  Well, to expand on what Sharon stated above, the ""Lady in the Iron Mask"" chase scene was, in my opinion, ""Moonlighting""'s funniest moment.  I find it interesting they could get the rights to the Pet Shop Boys, the Rolling Stones,  and all the classic Motown tracks, but NOT to ""The William Tell Overture""?  Then again, ""The Price is Right"" stopped using ""William Tell..."" in one of its games (The Race Game) some years back too.  Maybe Mr. Tell's publishing rights cost too much?  If anyone knows the reason why it was changed, PLEASE post it here.  I don't mean to sound ungrateful, it's just that one of my favorite television moments ever was totally ruined by the deletion of that piece of music.  I only hope when they release future seasons, the great usage of Janet Jackson's ""Nasty"" and the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" aren't altered.  Music was, as you can tell, an INTEGRAL part of ""Moonlighting"".  Fortunately, the music was intact for the shows' second funniest chase scene, which is in ""Camille"", starring Whoopi Goldberg.  That is by far my favroite episode in this set!  The juxtaposition between Camille being chased and the assassination attempt is just visually and audially(sp?) stunning.Now onto the rest of it...  Great, great great!!!  The packaging, start menu, etc. are just wonderful.  There's no scene selection feature, but I don't miss it at all.  The featurettes are done greatly as well.  The episodes with commentary are not listed in the episode description booklet that comes inside, but that is only a minor annoyance.  I haven't listened to any of the commentary yet, but seeing that Bruce, Cybill, and Glenn Caron all participated, it should not disappoint...

893456,A3628L43ZVEMP5,B0007XBMA2,Christopher Twelvetrees,"[2, 3]","""Moonlighting"" was a great show.  Bruce Willis, back when he was cool.  Cybill Shepherd, back when she was relatively young.  Shepherd was never a great actress but she did have the knack for looking good on camera.  And she and newcomer Willis had a good chemistry in the show.The best asset to ""Moonlighting"" was the writing.  Of course, it was cutting edge for the time, and that which is closest to the cutting edge dulls the fastest.  In many ways the show ""Moonlighting"" was cloned from, the already successful ""Remington Steele,"" holds up better in retrospect.While there was much breaking of the ""fourth wall"" (such as talking to the camera, reference to the script or the writers, etc.) Willis and Shepherd never broke character.  And sometimes the writers were simply intent on showing what wiseacres they were, such as producing, out of nowhere, a show modeled after a Shakespeare play.Seasons one and two are really the first six episodes (a pilot t.v. movie and five additional episodes in the first season) and a full season.  Well, as full as ""Moonlighting"" ever got.  Based on the first six episodes, ""Moonlighting"" promised to be one of the best series ever.  And the second season seemed to confirm it.  The third season started well, introducing Curtis Armstrong (""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Better off Dead"") as a love interest to the receptionist, and ""Atomic Shakespeare.""  Then, at the end of season three, the show started to wobble and it never recovered its balance until it limped away for good after season five.The first three seasons of ""Moonlighting"" are still pretty good television, compared to what we have in the twenty-first century;  and this is not nostalgia talking.But the DVD to ""Moonlighting"" has proven very disappointing.  I have had two sets of Seasons 1 & 2 and disk four on each one refuses to load or play.  And I had the same problem with disk three of season 3;  only, watching the shows in order, I had Season 3 too long to return it!  Bummer.One bad disk 4 in a set might happen by accident.  But having the same disk refuse to work twice, plus a disk on the next season doing the same?  I never had that trouble with ""Remington Steele"" or any other show I've tried.  It sounds like shoddy workmanship on their end.So, beware.  It's a great show, but the DVDs are rip-offs.",1,DON'T BUY MOONLIGHTING,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,2325,"['Moonlighting', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'cool', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'relatively', 'young', 'Shepherd', 'was', 'never', 'great', 'actress', 'did', 'have', 'knack', 'looking', 'good', 'camera', 'newcomer', 'Willis', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'show.The', 'best', 'asset', 'Moonlighting', 'was', 'writing', 'course', 'was', 'cutting', 'edge', 'time', 'closest', 'cutting', 'edge', 'fastest', 'many', 'ways', 'show', 'Moonlighting', 'was', 'cloned', 'already', 'successful', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'up', 'better', 'retrospect.While', 'was', 'much', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'such', 'talking', 'camera', 'reference', 'script', 'writers', 'etc', 'Willis', 'Shepherd', 'never', 'broke', 'character', 'sometimes', 'writers', 'were', 'simply', 'intent', 'showing', 'what', 'were', 'such', 'producing', 'nowhere', 'show', 'modeled', 'Shakespeare', 'play.Seasons', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'really', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'pilot', 't.v', 'movie', 'five', 'additional', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'full', 'season', 'Well', 'as', 'full', 'Moonlighting', 'ever', 'got', 'Based', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'Moonlighting', 'promised', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'second', 'season', 'seemed', 'confirm', 'third', 'season', 'started', 'well', 'introducing', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'Better', 'off', 'Dead', 'love', 'interest', 'receptionist', 'Atomic', 'Shakespeare', 'Then', 'end', 'season', 'three', 'show', 'started', 'wobble', 'never', 'recovered', 'balance', 'limped', 'away', 'good', 'season', 'five.The', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Moonlighting', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'television', 'compared', 'what', 'have', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'not', 'nostalgia', 'DVD', 'Moonlighting', 'proven', 'very', 'disappointing', 'have', 'had', 'two', 'sets', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'disk', 'four', 'one', 'load', 'play', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'disk', 'three', 'season', '3', 'only', 'watching', 'shows', 'order', 'had', 'Season', '3', 'too', 'long', 'return', 'Bummer.One', 'bad', 'disk', '4', 'set', 'might', 'happen', 'accident', 'having', 'same', 'disk', 'refuse', 'work', 'twice', 'disk', 'next', 'season', 'doing', 'same', 'never', 'had', 'trouble', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'other', 'show', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'shoddy', 'workmanship', 'end.So', 'beware', 'great', 'show', 'DVDs', 'are', 'rip-offs']",Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2
893457,A51IK68MWKV5R,B0007XBMA2,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[1, 2]","Casual Moonlighting fans will likely remember ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice"" as ""the one in black and white."" Operating as investigators on a dubious ""unfaithful spouse"" case, private investigators Maddie Hayes and David Addison (of the Blue Moon detective agency) are told about the notorious Flamingo Cove Murder, which involved a clarinetist, his songbird wife, and the new cornet player in their swing orchestra. The clarinetist was murdered, and the singer and cornetist (?) always swore that the other did the killing, right down to their dual executions.Hayes and Addison instantly form opposing opinions as to who is ""obviously"" guilty, leading to an argument, after which each goes home and dreams his/her side of the story. It's fairly weak for a wraparound, but the dreams make it worth it.Done in a film noir style, ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice"" references films of the era (especially The Postman Always Rings Twice) in addition to being solidly crafted, designed, shot, acted, written, and directed. (That year saw the series nominated for sixteen Emmys, eight of them for this episode.)Each's dream perfectly suits their personalities. Maddie's is more reminiscent of the expected style: straightforward, romantic, and melodramatic (with a nicely cathartic first kiss for Shepherd and Willis), while David's involves more ironic voice-over, wisecracks, and parodic fourth-wall breaking. (For those reasons, I prefer David's, although a tad more seriousness would have made it perfect.)And how they did this, I don't know, but Orson Welles made his final filmed appearance by introducing this ""Very Special Moonlighting."" (""Television,"" he says with the ever-present glint in his eye, ""is about to take a huge step ... backwards."") ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice"" is my second favorite of the series; only the second-season finale ""Camille,"" guest starring Judd Nelson and Whoopi Goldberg, tops it for pure entertainment value.",5,"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice (Season 2, Episode 4)",1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,1968,"['Casual', 'Moonlighting', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'remember', 'Dream', 'Sequence', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'one', 'black', 'white', 'Operating', 'investigators', 'dubious', 'unfaithful', 'spouse', 'case', 'private', 'investigators', 'Maddie', 'Hayes', 'David', 'Addison', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'detective', 'agency', 'are', 'told', 'notorious', 'Flamingo', 'Cove', 'Murder', 'involved', 'clarinetist', 'songbird', 'wife', 'new', 'cornet', 'player', 'swing', 'orchestra', 'clarinetist', 'was', 'murdered', 'singer', 'cornetist', 'always', 'swore', 'other', 'did', 'killing', 'right', 'down', 'dual', 'executions.Hayes', 'Addison', 'instantly', 'form', 'opposing', 'opinions', 'who', 'obviously', 'guilty', 'leading', 'argument', 'home', 'side', 'story', 'fairly', 'weak', 'wraparound', 'dreams', 'make', 'worth', 'it.Done', 'film', 'noir', 'style', 'Dream', 'Sequence', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'references', 'films', 'era', 'especially', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'addition', 'being', 'solidly', 'crafted', 'designed', 'shot', 'acted', 'written', 'directed', 'year', 'saw', 'series', 'nominated', 'sixteen', 'Emmys', 'eight', 'episode', 'dream', 'perfectly', 'suits', 'personalities', 'Maddie', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'expected', 'style', 'straightforward', 'romantic', 'melodramatic', 'nicely', 'cathartic', 'first', 'kiss', 'Shepherd', 'Willis', 'David', 'involves', 'more', 'ironic', 'voice-over', 'wisecracks', 'parodic', 'fourth-wall', 'breaking', 'reasons', 'prefer', 'David', 'tad', 'more', 'seriousness', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', 'how', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'made', 'final', 'filmed', 'appearance', 'introducing', 'Very', 'Special', 'Moonlighting', 'Television', 'ever-present', 'glint', 'eye', 'take', 'huge', 'step', 'backwards', 'Dream', 'Sequence', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'second', 'favorite', 'series', 'only', 'second-season', 'finale', 'Camille', 'guest', 'starring', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'value']",Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2
893458,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0007XBMA2,Cubist,"[16, 16]","In a landscape dominated by Dynasty and Hill St. Blues, Moonlighting was a breath of fresh air when it debuted on American television in 1985. It was a detective show that provided a funny, witty alternative and ambitiously took the screwball comedy popular in the `30s and `40s and gave it a contemporary spin that has never been duplicated as successfully on mainstream TV since.The first two seasons feature Moonlighting in its purest form: sharp and focused. What makes the show work so well is the chemistry between Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. They banter and bicker furiously like a couple straight out of a Howard Hawks screwball comedy. Their exchanges are delivered fast with dialogue often overlapping that is very funny.The writing on the show is very good. The dialogue is crisp with a snap and pop to it. In ""Next Stop Murder,"" an homage to Agatha Christie murder mysteries, Blue Moon's chipper, rhyming receptionist, Miss DiPesto (Beasley) wins a contest to participate in famous mystery writer J.B. Harland's murder mystery train. David and Maddie drive her to the station and accidentally get stranded on the train with a real murder to solve. Here is a memorable exchange in the episode:Maddie: ""I was not born yesterday!""David: ""It's true. I had lunch with her yesterday. If she'd been born I'd a noticed.""It isn't only the words but how Willis delivers them that makes what he says so funny. And yet, the show isn't wall-to-wall comedy. There are sober moments of drama and, of course, romance. The show even addresses David's lack of maturity in ""My Fair David,"" where Maddie bets him that he can't act like a mature professional for a full week. This episode features some of the funniest bits between Shepherd and Willis in the show's entire run.This excellent 6-DVD set features top notch transfers and a nice collection of extras, featuring the participation of the three regulars (Willis, Shepherd and Beasley), for fans to enjoy.The first DVD features an audio commentary on the ""Pilot"" by writer/creator Glenn Gordon Caron, director Robert Butler, editor Artie Mandelberg and producer Jay Daniel. Completists and fans that have the Anchor Bay DVD should hold onto it as there is a different commentary with Caron and Willis.""Not Just A Day Job - The Story of Moonlight Part 1"" takes a look at the first season. ""Moonlighting Pilot Promo"" features a collection of vintage TV ads for the first episode of the show.The third DVD includes an audio commentary on ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice"" by director Peter Werner, co-writer Debra Frank and Caron. The met a lot of resistance from the network who didn't want them to shoot in black and white with ambitious musical numbers.There is also a commentary for ""My Fair David"" with director Will Mackenzie and Bruce Willis. They point out the continuity goofs on Willis' tie and tend to spend more time watching the episode then commenting on it.The fifth DVD features an audio commentary on ""Twas the Episode Before Christmas"" by director Werner, Daniel and Allyce Beasley. Daniel provides a wealth of production information and trivia.Also included is an audio commentary on ""Every Daughter's Father is a Virgin"" by Cybill Shepherd and Caron. They talk about how an episode is put together while the actress is refreshinglycandid about the times when she lost her cool.The sixth DVD features ""The Story of Moonlighting Part 2"" which focuses on the second season. Caron used the show's success to spend additional money on more ambitious episodes. However, they didn't always meet their scheduled air dates with scenes being written on the spot.""The Moonlighting Phenomenon"" has fans, critics and crew members gush about the show and talk about its significance.

The DVD set includes all 24 episodes from the shows 1st and 2nd season, including the pilot episode. The episodes look really great and transferred quite well. Moonlighting episodes always seemed like mini-movies, now they can be watched without commercials.Moonlighting seasons 1 & 2 are considered the shows best two seasons by many fans. The premise was unique. Cybill starred as Maddie Hayes. She is a former model who was living the good life until she wakes up one morning to smashing dishes. Her chef is having an uber fit because his check bounced. Turns out all of the staff members checks have bounced. Maddie learns that her accountant has ran off with all of her money. Her business manager suggests that she liquadate some of ber investment businesses. She stops at the detective agency that she owns and meets David Addison. She doesn't get a chance to turn down the agency. She is intrigued by him and the business and the two embark on making the detective agency a success.The Packaging & DiscsThe good news is that the discs are single sided. Many hour long shows have been released on dual discs as of late, but Moonlighting fans will be pleased to know that these 6 disc are single sided with color art work on each disc. The packaging is pretty, but it isnt the greatest. It would be nice if the discs were encased in individual slip cases, but they are in plastic shells. Several of my discs were loose when my set arrived--despite this fact all of my discs operated correctly. The cover art is very beautiful with an early Moonlighting promotional shot designed in a fashion in which the first disc looks like a moon.Buy this set not only for the episodes but for the extras.Not Just a day Job, the Story of Moonlighting, Part 1The writer/creator of the show discusses how he had a production deal with ABC. He created three pilots and Moonlighting was the third pilot that was shot and it was picked up. Bruce Willis discusses his audition process and how he got the part on the show. He even mentions flirting with Cybil behind the scenes to help and get the part. Cybil and Bruce do not appear TOGETHER in the featurette. She is shown alone in a room with hazy lighting wearing a black dress. The room has a black background. It's a very surreal setting that she is in. Bruce is very alive in his scenes during this feature. His head is bald and he is wearing a tee shirt. He appears very relaxed. In one scene Cybill makes it clear that her and Bruce were never lovers in real life. It is very interesting to see the people behind the scenes discuss how the show came together. Singer Al Jarreau is even seen discussing how he got involved with creating the shows theme song.Inside the Blue Moon Detective Agency, The Story of Moonlighting, Part 2Part 2 is even more interesting than part 1. The people behind the scenes continue to discuss how the show came together. One especially touching moment is when the writers and cast members discuss the day Orson Welles came to the set. He taped a spot that was shown prior to the infamous black and white film noir episodes. Turns out that Orson Welles taped these spots a week prior to his death. Various crew members also discuss the making of the black and white episodes. It turns out that at that time there was no studio in Hollywood that would develop that old black & white film stock that the episodes was shot on. It was suggested that they just take out the color, but the shows creators had a bigger budget once the show was proven a success so they went all out. In the end, MGM developed the film stock. Another interesting aspect disclosed is just how the shows creators really got down to the wire as far as meeting their deadline to air time. This is a really great behind the scenes featurette. This featurette also includes Bruce Willis, Cybil Sheppard and Allyce Beasly (Ms. Depesto).The Moonlighting PhenomenonThis is a really neat featurette. Members of the Moonlighting fan club and others appear in this featurette and discuss the importance of the show. One woman discusses how Moonlighting was the topic of conversation on Wednesday morning.Pilot episode Promo SpotsThe producers of this DVD really put a lot of effort into this box set.

I'm really enjoying the great verbal interplay between the leads -- it's very reminiscent of the wonderful screwball comedies of Preston Sturges and Howard Hawkes.The first season is the most 'plot driven' of the series.  By season two, the great dialogue, romance and office nonsense had become predominant, which in the case of Moonlighting, was all to the better!Truly, this wonderful show was only nominally a 'detective' story and used the detective plots for sight gags and madcap moments.  Also, I had forgotten how good a singer Bruce Willis was; not in a professional way, but in off-the-wall singing!I had taped these off the original ABC airings and so far have not noticed any cuts.  I haven't cued them up because my tapes of the first 3 seasons were destroyed in a house fire...  Thus, getting these replacement DVDs of the first 2 seasons was a godsend.I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves great dialogue and verbal banter.  The chemistry between the leads belies Cybill's comments that they never 'slept together.'  There's a lot of 'tension' between the two leads which gives the romantic tension believability and, of course, the off-stage tension between the two was tabloid fodder for years.Buying this series is like buying 24 movies and, thus, one hell-of-a bargain!

I agree with those that say the pilot is the weakest of these shows; the writers continued to improve as time went on and the line delivery of the actors improved as well.  It's almost funny the way they light Cybill Shepherd!  It's not as if she was ancient; after all she was only 35 when the show started.  But I digress.  I also agree that it's unforutnate that they replaced the ""William Tell Overture"" (aka ""the Lone Ranger"") in the ""Lady in the Iron Veil"" eppy. The piece of music was okay for a chase scene, but it lacked the comedic element.  (**found out via an online source that this was simply an error made at the studio; they used the clip with the ""mockup"" music by mistake.  I hope someday they'll release a new DVD set with the correct music). However.  The show is still funny, Bruce is still extremely charming, and IMO, makes the show.  It's so hard to believe that the idgits at ABC didn't want him!  Cybill did a great job...at the time, no one knew she could do comedy.

893480,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007XBMA2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 11]","I still have what I consider to be the best episodes of ""Moonlighting"" on tape (albeit, Beta tapes).  So when I watched the first two seasons of Glen Gordon Caron's seminal dramedy series that first aired in 1985 and saw the rest of the show I found myself wishing that we did some television shows the way they do in Great Britain.  A ""series"" across the pond is what we call a season here, and a show like ""Coupling,"" for example, might do only six episodes in a season.  Well, the first season of ""Moonlighting"" only had five episodes after the pilot movie, and like most series the other writers had problems getting a handle on the show's uniqueness.  Only ""The Next Murder You Hear,"" written by Peter Silverman, is on the same level as the pilot.  ""Moonlighting"" was pretty good, but it had its low points and imagine how great it would have been if these were the six episodes that made up the second season:(8) ""Brother, Can You Spare a Blonde?"" (Written by Caron), in which David's brother Ritchie (Charles Rocket) stops by for a visit; (10) ""Money Talks, Maddie Walks"") (Written by Kerry Ehrin & Ali Marie Matheson), where Maddie finds out that the accountant who embezzled her fortune is running a casino down South American way; (11) ""The Dream Sequences Always Rings Twice"" (Written by Debra Frank & Carl Sautter) is the monochromatic episode, introduced by Orson Welles, where we get Maddie and David's different takes on an unsolved murder mystery from 1946; (15) ""Portrait of Maddie"" (Written by Ehrin & Matheson) in which a painting of Maddie is a clue to a stolen masterpiece and an episode which features the longest period of time without dialogue in the show's history; (21) ""Every Father's Daughter is a Virgin"" (Written by Bruce Franklin Singer) has Maddie's mother (Eva Marie Saint) and father (Robert Webber) paying a visit, and David finding out something about Maddie's father she does not want to know; and (22) ""Witness for the Execution"" (Written by Jeff Reno & Ron Osborn) surprises us by coming up with a reason for David and Maddie to finally kiss.This is not to say that there are not other episodes in the running (e.g., ""My Fair David"" and ""In God We Strongly Suspect"") and if somebody wants to argue there should be eight episodes or even ten (add ""Atlas Belched"" and ""Funeral for a Door Nail"") I will not say thee nay.  But given the problems they had shooting their 140 pages scripts and getting new episodes on each week, I cannot help but think that the show would have been even greater if we they had not wasted precious time on less than stellar episodes, such as the painful ""Camille"" that wastes Whoopi Goldberg and Judd Nelson in a story that abuses the show's post modernistic tendency to break the fourth wall.For my money ""M*A*S*H"" became the original television dramedy with its first season episode ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet.""  As a Detective Comedy/Drama ""Moonlighting"" is clearly a dramedy as well, but a large part of its uniqueness as a television series was because of it being decidedly postmodern.  There was the verbal self-reflexivity in which David and Maddie were clearly aware they were television characters, the musical self-reflexivity where ""Moonlighting"" employed an incongruous juxtaposition of the musical soundtrack and the action on screen (using ""The William Tell Overture"" for the chase scene at the end of ""The Lady in the Iron Mask"") or sometimes it fits (e.g., when David listens to ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"" while trailing Maddie's father), and the show's intertextuality as it plays with the boundaries of the Situation Comedy and the Detective genres.  Then there are all references to other texts such as films, songs, novels, etc., through episode titles (e.g., ""My Fair David,"" ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice""), dialogue, musical cues, and visual techniques.Picking up all these references was what made watching ""Moonlighting"" fun as David and Maddie slowly but surely fought their verbal duels on their way to their inevitable kiss in the parking garage.  If there is a ""mistake"" to be found in some of the early episodes it is the idea that the detective part of the show was as important as the relationship between the two stars.  But coming up with an actual mystery for the Blue Moon Detective Agency to solve was not as important as the fact the case would gave David and Maddie something to fight about.  If she was not going to end up slamming a door over the case of the week, then the writers are missing the point.  But then the strangest thing about watching the ""Moonlighting"" pilot is being shocked at how slow the two stars are talking at that point.The key thing is that when ""Moonlighting"" was good during those first two seasons it was great, and even when it is not so good, there are usually a couple of good one liners buried in it to be enjoyed.  Cybil Shepherd and Bruce Willis apparently ended up not being able to stand each other off camera, but their on screen chemistry is undeniable (I was pleasantly surprised Willis showed up to do an audio commentary track for ""My Fair David,"" not to mention his remembering the ""You de-Daved him"" line).  Therefore it is probably a good thing that they did not do the less is more approach.  Still, a ""Moonlighting"" that was written only by Glen Gordon Caron would have been something to watch (think a ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" written only by Joss Whedon).So when is Season 3 coming

I normally transfer my DVDs to digital files to run directly off my computer's huge 2 terabyte hard drive used for storing videos; this gives me more freedom to choose what to watch. After watching Season 1, only 2 episodes remain (judged re-watchable). Season 2 has four episodes remaining on the drive.Rationale: David Madison reminds me too much of my most obnoxious students - who badger and annoy when they are told NO as they try to get you to change your mind. Gee, am I describing a BRAT? When Maddie says NO to David, off he goes into his badgering - sometimes he is funny (in Season 3 he is funny) but most times NO. Personally, I feel no empathy for Maddie since when David starts his brat mode it is a sure thing that she will give in.Comedy: Physical comedy is the show's major comedy strength; most of the verbal comedy seldom works (the quips remind me of the style used in the Die Hard movie series by Bruce Willis). The absurd seems to be the key to the better episodes - greater absurdity often leads to fun.Detective Strength: No sleuthing depth, it is just a facade for the interplay between the characters. This is not Columbo!Acting: The leads are good actors and what they are asked to say is the weakness. David trying to be extra cute with his quips seldom works. The support actors, especially in the Blue Moon office are excellent and add fun to the episodes.Buying Suggestion: Season 3 is outstanding!

It isn't muffled, just lower so turning up the volume is an easy fix.  Also, thank you to Lion's Gate for (1) giving this volume a decent price, unlike the greed that is associated with the release of Northern Exposure's seasons; (2) using single-sided discs with classy labeling; (3) having a nice package for the DVD's; and very importantly, (4) not bombarding us with ads and other unnecessary garbage that we are forced to watch or else flip through at the beginning of the discs!

893488,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0007XBMA2,Nicholas Carroll,"[6, 7]","I heard that the reason this TV series took so long to be released on DVD was because of the difficulty and expense of securing the rights to all the songs that Bruce Willis sings throughout the series. They could have rushed out a DVD where they edit out his little ditties (much like MTV did with ""The Real World New York"" on DVD), but I'm so glad they didn't. That was a major part of the appeal of the show for me. Bruce Willis singing got me to buy his two albums when I was a teenager. He was my idol at the time, as I wanted to be like David Addison...the coolest guy in the universe!I haven't seen this show in 15 years, so it has been amazing to watch again after so much time has passed. Its like meeting again with an old friend. So many details that I had forgotten, yet some memorable scenes that are awesome to view again (I remembered most the ""Limbo Rock"" scene, the scene where ""This Old Heart of Mine"" plays when David reignites an old flame, and lines like, ""a coffin in a hearse--call Mike Wallace!"" or the Seusslike dialogue about a Chinese man with a mole on his nose). Relive all this and more! This collection represents the first two seasons, when the show was fresh, funny, clever, original, and the best thing on TV (before the battles between Cybill and Bruce became so disruptive that the show focused on secondary characters like Miss Dipesto and her boyfriend).In watching these shows again, its easy to see what's great about it and what wasn't great about it. The battles between David Addison and Maddie Hayes were what made this show immensely watchable. The fast-talking wit and clever references to pop culture tidbits always kept the viewer alert and needing to watch again to catch everything. The only thing that doesn't hold up well were the cases. Many of them weren't that well thought out, though there were often twists upon twists. However, in terms of crime solving cases, this wasn't the show for a serious look at that. This show is all about Maddie and David, the tensions between them, their polar opposite personalities that ignited a firestorm between them. Once the show made them sleep together, it went downhill in a hurry. It ran for 5 seasons, but the first three are worth owning to watch again and again. Hope that they will release the other seasons on DVD soon...but until then, I'll continue to watch these classic episodes of my favorite show of all time.",5,My Favorite Television Show of ALL TIME!,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,2419,"['heard', 'reason', 'TV', 'series', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'difficulty', 'expense', 'securing', 'rights', 'songs', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'sings', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'rushed', 'out', 'DVD', 'where', 'edit', 'out', 'little', 'ditties', 'much', 'MTV', 'did', 'Real', 'World', 'New', 'York', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'major', 'part', 'appeal', 'show', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'singing', 'got', 'buy', 'two', 'albums', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'was', 'idol', 'time', 'wanted', 'be', 'David', 'Addison', 'coolest', 'guy', 'universe', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', '15', 'years', 'been', 'amazing', 'watch', 'again', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'meeting', 'again', 'old', 'friend', 'So', 'many', 'details', 'had', 'forgotten', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'are', 'awesome', 'view', 'again', 'remembered', 'most', 'Limbo', 'Rock', 'scene', 'scene', 'where', 'Old', 'Heart', 'Mine', 'when', 'David', 'old', 'flame', 'lines', 'coffin', 'hearse', 'call', 'Mike', 'Wallace', 'Seusslike', 'dialogue', 'Chinese', 'man', 'mole', 'nose', 'Relive', 'more', 'collection', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'fresh', 'funny', 'clever', 'original', 'best', 'thing', 'TV', 'battles', 'Cybill', 'Bruce', 'became', 'so', 'disruptive', 'show', 'focused', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Miss', 'Dipesto', 'boyfriend', 'watching', 'shows', 'again', 'easy', 'see', 'what', 'great', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'battles', 'David', 'Addison', 'Maddie', 'Hayes', 'were', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'immensely', 'watchable', 'fast-talking', 'wit', 'clever', 'references', 'pop', 'culture', 'tidbits', 'always', 'kept', 'viewer', 'alert', 'needing', 'watch', 'again', 'catch', 'everything', 'only', 'thing', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'were', 'cases', 'Many', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'were', 'often', 'upon', 'twists', 'However', 'terms', 'crime', 'solving', 'cases', 'was', ""n't"", 'show', 'serious', 'look', 'show', 'Maddie', 'David', 'tensions', 'polar', 'opposite', 'personalities', 'ignited', 'firestorm', 'show', 'made', 'sleep', 'together', 'went', 'downhill', 'hurry', 'ran', '5', 'seasons', 'first', 'three', 'are', 'worth', 'owning', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'Hope', 'will', 'release', 'other', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'soon', 'then', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'watch', 'classic', 'episodes', 'favorite', 'show', 'time']",Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2

893490,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B0007XBMA2,Paulo Leite,"[130, 144]","Moonlighting came in 1985 and had a great impact in all the fiction written for television since then. Why? Well.. let's see...It all started as the basic detective formula: two incompatible oddballs brought together having to solve one case in each episode - basically the same premisse present in most of the shows until then.But there is more than meets the eye.Moonlighting introduced new values such as MUSIC.... no other show had such a dramatic use of music as Moonlighting. Here, the usual ""chase music"" present in all shows were changed for Motown, blues, old rock classics and other kinds of music that where always used to a dramatic effect. The choice of each song we hear throughout the seasons was cleverly made... It means that most of the shows that came after... from CHINA BEACH to SEX AND THE CITY to SIX FEET UNDER owes a lot to the way Moonlighting started to use music. I just feel sorry that the producers never released a bigger soundtrack on cd because the CD that came in 1987 was far from its potential....More...Moonlighting opened up the TV narrative to the inner mind of the characters... in the sence that from then on, everything was possible in terms of what's going on inside the characters and the way we see it on the screen. The usual voiceover narration (that's as far as TV shows went until Moonlighting) was replaced by dreams, animation, musical numbers, richer editing, etc... again, Moonlighting opened the path to the great TV fiction we see today. THE SOPRANOS owe a lot to that.More...No other TV show relied upon the viewer's bond to the characters as Moonlighting... you can see that by the incredible number of ways fiction and reality merged during many episodes... many times, David Addison adressed the audience directly. Many times the characters show the sets and the fact that they are in a TV show... something that 99% of the TV shows at that time could not do. It is true that Moonlighting was not the only show to do that. SLEDGE HAMMER, many times did the same... but Moonlighting wasn't only a comedy......It was perhaps one of the first TV shows to blend different genres that were usually kept separated. Was it comedy? Was it detective-genre like MAGNUM P.I.? Was it romance? It was certainly not fantasy... but there was a lot of fantasy in it....It was one of the first TV ""self-aware"" shows that even paid homages to Cinema (Film noir, great musicals, keystone cops... just to name a few).It was also one of the first TV shows that actually had great supporting roles with plots and conflicts on their own.Moonlighting brought also more mature themes and an increasingly complexness to the leading character's motivations. And in this sence it is fascinating to see that in Moonlighting we have a detective show where many episodes go by where Maddie and David do not have cases to solve... where the spotlight is in their relationship.It is like the show started as a formula and drifted to something richer, more complex, newer...TODAY, fiction is miles beyond Moonlighting... but the show remains fascinating as an example of a TV product where everything is right. I trully believe Moonlighting had an important role in the development of TV fiction into what we see today.By the way... this DVD edition has been long anticipated by many fans like myself... It seems that it took a long time to secure the rights to all the great songs in the episodes... but now that everything is in order... let's enjoy the perfect chemistry between Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis... the last heirs of Katherine Hapburn and Cary Grant...Simply great!!!!!!!!!",5,A LANDMARK SHOW NOW ON DVD AT LAST!!!!,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,3617,"['Moonlighting', 'came', '1985', 'had', 'great', 'impact', 'fiction', 'written', 'television', 'then', 'Why', 'Well..', 'let', 'see', 'all', 'started', 'basic', 'detective', 'formula', 'two', 'incompatible', 'oddballs', 'brought', 'together', 'having', 'solve', 'one', 'case', 'episode', 'basically', 'same', 'premisse', 'present', 'most', 'shows', 'then.But', 'more', 'eye.Moonlighting', 'introduced', 'new', 'values', 'such', 'MUSIC', 'other', 'show', 'had', 'dramatic', 'use', 'music', 'Moonlighting', 'Here', 'usual', 'chase', 'music', 'present', 'shows', 'were', 'changed', 'Motown', 'blues', 'old', 'rock', 'classics', 'other', 'kinds', 'music', 'where', 'always', 'used', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'choice', 'song', 'hear', 'seasons', 'was', 'cleverly', 'made', 'most', 'shows', 'came', 'CHINA', 'BEACH', 'SEX', 'AND', 'THE', 'CITY', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'lot', 'way', 'Moonlighting', 'started', 'use', 'music', 'just', 'feel', 'sorry', 'producers', 'never', 'released', 'bigger', 'soundtrack', 'cd', 'CD', 'came', '1987', 'was', 'far', 'potential', '.More', 'Moonlighting', 'opened', 'up', 'TV', 'narrative', 'inner', 'mind', 'characters', 'sence', 'then', 'everything', 'was', 'possible', 'terms', 'what', 'going', 'characters', 'way', 'see', 'screen', 'usual', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'as', 'far', 'TV', 'shows', 'went', 'Moonlighting', 'was', 'replaced', 'dreams', 'animation', 'musical', 'numbers', 'richer', 'editing', 'etc', 'again', 'Moonlighting', 'opened', 'path', 'great', 'TV', 'fiction', 'see', 'today', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS', 'owe', 'lot', 'that.More', 'other', 'TV', 'show', 'relied', 'viewer', 'bond', 'characters', 'Moonlighting', 'can', 'see', 'incredible', 'number', 'ways', 'fiction', 'reality', 'merged', 'many', 'episodes', 'many', 'times', 'David', 'Addison', 'adressed', 'audience', 'directly', 'Many', 'times', 'characters', 'show', 'sets', 'fact', 'are', 'TV', 'show', 'something', '99', '%', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'true', 'Moonlighting', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'do', 'SLEDGE', 'HAMMER', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'same', 'Moonlighting', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'comedy', 'was', 'perhaps', 'one', 'first', 'TV', 'shows', 'blend', 'different', 'genres', 'were', 'usually', 'kept', 'separated', 'Was', 'comedy', 'Was', 'detective-genre', 'MAGNUM', 'P.I.', 'Was', 'romance', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'fantasy', 'was', 'lot', 'fantasy', '.It', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'TV', 'self-aware', 'even', 'paid', 'homages', 'Cinema', 'Film', 'noir', 'great', 'musicals', 'keystone', 'cops', 'just', 'name', 'few', '.It', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'first', 'TV', 'shows', 'actually', 'had', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles', 'plots', 'conflicts', 'own.Moonlighting', 'brought', 'also', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'increasingly', 'complexness', 'leading', 'character', 'motivations', 'sence', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Moonlighting', 'have', 'detective', 'show', 'where', 'many', 'episodes', 'go', 'where', 'Maddie', 'David', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'cases', 'solve', 'where', 'spotlight', 'relationship.It', 'show', 'started', 'formula', 'drifted', 'something', 'richer', 'more', 'complex', 'newer', 'TODAY', 'fiction', 'miles', 'Moonlighting', 'show', 'fascinating', 'example', 'TV', 'product', 'where', 'everything', 'right', 'trully', 'believe', 'Moonlighting', 'had', 'important', 'role', 'development', 'TV', 'fiction', 'what', 'see', 'way', 'DVD', 'edition', 'been', 'long', 'anticipated', 'many', 'fans', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'secure', 'rights', 'great', 'songs', 'episodes', 'now', 'everything', 'order', 'let', 'enjoy', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'last', 'heirs', 'Katherine', 'Hapburn', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Simply', 'great']",Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2
893491,A261PFFOK6LLGZ,B0007XBMA2,Petter Sellers,"[9, 11]","Moonlighting was a television show that premiered on March 3 1985 and was carried by the channel ABC.  It lasted through five seasons.  Moonlighting is a perfect example how good writing, talent and chemistry come through and have TV viewers wanting more and more of one show.  Moonlighting is also a perfect example of how can a top show reach bottom and fail to further please the audiences, due to lack of commitment as well as evaporation of that magic chemistry.It is a long awaited event by fans throughout the world.Moonlighting is finally out on DVD.  Personally, I have had it with my videotaped versions of the show.  I needed to relive the magic of that show from the beginning through the help of a Digital Version.  The Episodes run very wonderful and it is a pleasure to hear crystal clear the musical theme on every beginning.  The picture is crystal clear and the audio is digital stereo (not 5.1 surround as it is stated by the technical characteristics).  Still, at some points you will notice the audio changing from stereo to mono and stereo again.Another issue that comes up in this DVD collection of the two first seasons is the fact that some episodes have been altered.  It seems ridiculous to have episodes altered when transferring to DVD especially if you examine the reason that this is done.  For example, in the episode ""A funeral for a doornail"" in the sex shop scene, there is furniture superimposed in front of Maddie the moment she is reading a dirty magazine.  Clearly there was no reason for that type censoring because the front page of the magazine was visible and at the bit offensive for the prudish back in the `80s.  Was there a legal issue with the magazine this time around?  One can only speculate.  And why did they provide us the classic episode ""The Lady with the iron mask"" with a newly recorded soundtrack?  Was it that difficult to gain the rights for the musical themes that were played on the original episode?  For people who are new to Moonlighting such issues may be trivial, but for people who have fond memories of that TV series such things matter.So what can we do?  We were so anxious for the release of Moonlighting so we can not be stopped by such minor technicalities.  I rushed and bought the DVD collection of the two first seasons as soon as I could, not to mention I have already pre-ordered Season 3.  No true fan can be left behind from such a treat of their favourite television show.Do I need to advertise the show?  To people who are familiar with there is no reason at all.  This show has many fans through out the globe.  Do I need to advertise the show to younger and unfamiliar generations?  Surely enough by saying that television dialogue, character development and television entertainment is at its best rolled into this old series.We can only hope in the future that the episodes will all be restored in their original form and further more, there will deleted scenes, and there will be the teaser 15 to 30 second TV ads and much, much more.  The has to be a second time around of doing a professional job on the inclusion of all this trivia because I am almost certain that like me, a great deal of fans will buy them all over again.  Just try to keep away from anniversary editions that appear every five years and include a new item that has been recently discovered.  Pretty much, I feel we have all had it with the predatory marketing that started as a business trend during the late `90s.",4,Moonlighting .... at last ...

893493,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B0007XBMA2,P Magnum,"[2, 3]","Moonlighting is a smart & sophisticated show that debuted with a short six episode season in 1985.  The show revolves around Maddy Hayes (Cybil Shepherd) a fashion model who is bilked out of her money by a shady accountant.  She is forced to start selling off her assets, one of which is the Blue Moon Detective Agency.  She is going to sell that as well until she is drawn in by the charismatic David Addison (Bruce Willis).  She joins the agency and together they get involved in screwy cases.  The sexual tension between Maddy & David is the crux of the first two seasons.  The will they or won't they vibe permeates the show.  The show itself harkens back to the witty comedies of the 30's & 40's where the banter between David & Maddy is smart and high-brow.  The show had some quirky episodes like a flashback to a 1940's murder show in black & white (and containing an introduction by Orson Welles).  The show was a critical smash, but did not catch on with the general public in large part to numerous production delays that postponed many episodes and stalling any momentum the show gained.",5,Smart & Sophisticated TV,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1099,"['Moonlighting', 'smart', 'sophisticated', 'show', 'debuted', 'short', 'six', 'episode', 'season', '1985', 'show', 'around', 'Maddy', 'Hayes', 'Cybil', 'Shepherd', 'fashion', 'model', 'who', 'bilked', 'money', 'shady', 'accountant', 'forced', 'start', 'selling', 'off', 'assets', 'one', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'Detective', 'Agency', 'going', 'sell', 'as', 'well', 'drawn', 'charismatic', 'David', 'Addison', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'agency', 'together', 'get', 'involved', 'screwy', 'cases', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Maddy', 'David', 'crux', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'vibe', 'show', 'show', 'back', 'witty', 'comedies', '30', '40', 'where', 'banter', 'David', 'Maddy', 'smart', 'high-brow', 'show', 'had', 'quirky', 'episodes', 'flashback', '1940', 'murder', 'show', 'black', 'white', 'containing', 'introduction', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'show', 'was', 'critical', 'smash', 'did', 'not', 'catch', 'general', 'public', 'large', 'part', 'numerous', 'production', 'delays', 'postponed', 'many', 'episodes', 'stalling', 'momentum', 'show', 'gained']",Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2

893498,AEGQWVR6KWBV,B0007XBMA2,"Ron Cronovich ""Ron""","[295, 302]","""Moonlighting"" truly is one of the best television series of all time. It was extremely creative, loaded with great humor and drama, and occasionally some action and intrigue. It faltered a bit in its last two seasons, but even they are worth 5 stars.The premise: Maddie Hayes (Cybill Sheperd) is a former model running a nearly bankrupt detective agency. David Addison (Bruce Willis) convinces her to run the agency together as partners instead of shutting it down.  They bumble their way through many mysteries, solving most of them. Maddie and David couldn't be more different - Maddie is conservative, reserved, preoccupied with being responsible, and slightly repressed and uptight. David is spontaneous almost to a fault, and not terribly responsible.  These stark personality differences lead to some very funny banter in every episode.  Yet, both have big hearts, and over the course of Seasons 1 and 2, they fall very much in love - even though they cannot admit it - especially to themsevles.In the typical episode, David and Maddie work on a case. However, there's much more going on. Events in the case parallel events in one or both of the main characters' lives, or their relationship with each other.  It's obvious that the writers, directors, cast and crew are having a great time making this show.  The writing is very clever, and as the series progresses, the characters occasionally show awareness that they are characters on a television show - to great humorous effect. In later seasons, there are episodes that have themes - such as a black and white film noir take-off, and a hilarious modernized version of Shakespear's Taming of the Shrew. In its first two seasons, Moonlighting is a bit more conventional - though still innovative and still one of the finest television programs ever.Moonlighting has other strengths.  One is Agnes DiPesto, the delightfully quirky receptionist that answers every phone call with a different rhyme.  Another is a roster of great guest stars, like Orson Wells, Tim Robbins, Dana Delany, Whoopi Goldberg, and many more (and the ones I named are all in the first two seasons, so you'll be seeing them on this DVD set).  Moonlighting also features great music - not just the classic theme song by Al Jarreau.  Nearly every episode has great classic tunes.  The first two seasons include songs by Little Richard, Patsy Cline, Smokey Robinson, Otis Redding, The Rolling Stones, The Temptations, The Isley Brothers, and Gene Kelly, and many others.The picture and sound quality are excellent for a 20-year-old TV show, and better than when these episodes were broadcast on Bravo in recent years.  This set is a great value, too, considering that you get a total of 23 episodes (all 5 episodes from the brief Season One, which began late in the year, plus 18 episodes from Season Two, which ran a regular fall-to-spring schedule).  The DVD extras are a lot of fun, especially two short documentaries (one for each of the first two seasons) that feature interviews with Bruce, Cybill, the actress that plays Miss DiPesto, and some of the writers and crew members.  They all have interesting stories to share about their experiences making Moonlighting.Highly recommended.If you're curious about why it has taken so long for Moonlighting to come to DVD, it's because Lions Gate had great difficulty securing the necessary rights to all of the songs featured in the various episodes.  The music came from a variety of different sources and record labels, some of which have gone bankrupt or been taken over by other corporations in the last 15 years.  A few years ago, Lions Gate considered releasing Moonlighting on DVD without music, but this was unacceptable to Glenn Caron, the series' creator.  Finally, they obtained the necessary rights to all of the songs that so greatly enriched this wonderful show. They also got Bruce Willis & Cybill Sheperd involved in some of the DVD extras, and now we can finally see the result of all this hard work!",5,One of the best television shows ever,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,3998,"['Moonlighting', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'time', 'was', 'extremely', 'creative', 'loaded', 'great', 'humor', 'drama', 'occasionally', 'action', 'intrigue', 'faltered', 'bit', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'even', 'are', 'worth', '5', 'stars.The', 'premise', 'Maddie', 'Hayes', 'Cybill', 'Sheperd', 'former', 'model', 'running', 'nearly', 'bankrupt', 'detective', 'agency', 'David', 'Addison', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'run', 'agency', 'together', 'partners', 'instead', 'shutting', 'down', 'bumble', 'way', 'many', 'mysteries', 'solving', 'most', 'Maddie', 'David', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Maddie', 'conservative', 'reserved', 'preoccupied', 'being', 'responsible', 'slightly', 'repressed', 'uptight', 'David', 'spontaneous', 'almost', 'fault', 'not', 'terribly', 'responsible', 'stark', 'personality', 'differences', 'lead', 'very', 'funny', 'banter', 'episode', 'have', 'big', 'hearts', 'course', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'fall', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'admit', 'especially', 'themsevles.In', 'typical', 'episode', 'David', 'Maddie', 'work', 'case', 'However', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'Events', 'case', 'parallel', 'events', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'lives', 'relationship', 'other', 'obvious', 'writers', 'directors', 'cast', 'crew', 'are', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'making', 'show', 'writing', 'very', 'clever', 'series', 'characters', 'occasionally', 'show', 'awareness', 'are', 'characters', 'television', 'show', 'great', 'humorous', 'effect', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'episodes', 'have', 'themes', 'such', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'noir', 'take-off', 'hilarious', 'modernized', 'version', 'Shakespear', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Moonlighting', 'bit', 'more', 'conventional', 'still', 'innovative', 'still', 'one', 'finest', 'television', 'programs', 'ever.Moonlighting', 'other', 'strengths', 'One', 'Agnes', 'DiPesto', 'delightfully', 'quirky', 'receptionist', 'answers', 'phone', 'call', 'different', 'rhyme', 'roster', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'many', 'more', 'ones', 'named', 'are', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'set', 'Moonlighting', 'also', 'great', 'music', 'not', 'just', 'classic', 'theme', 'song', 'Al', 'Jarreau', 'Nearly', 'episode', 'great', 'classic', 'tunes', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'include', 'songs', 'Little', 'Richard', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'Otis', 'Redding', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Temptations', 'Isley', 'Brothers', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'many', 'others.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', '20-year-old', 'TV', 'show', 'better', 'when', 'episodes', 'were', 'broadcast', 'Bravo', 'recent', 'years', 'set', 'great', 'value', 'too', 'considering', 'get', 'total', '23', 'episodes', '5', 'episodes', 'brief', 'Season', 'One', 'began', 'late', 'year', '18', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Two', 'ran', 'regular', 'fall-to-spring', 'schedule', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'especially', 'two', 'short', 'documentaries', 'one', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'feature', 'interviews', 'Bruce', 'Cybill', 'actress', 'Miss', 'DiPesto', 'writers', 'crew', 'members', 'have', 'interesting', 'stories', 'share', 'experiences', 'making', 'Moonlighting.Highly', 'recommended.If', ""'re"", 'curious', 'why', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'Moonlighting', 'come', 'DVD', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'had', 'great', 'difficulty', 'securing', 'necessary', 'rights', 'songs', 'featured', 'various', 'episodes', 'music', 'came', 'variety', 'different', 'sources', 'record', 'labels', 'have', 'gone', 'bankrupt', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'other', 'corporations', 'last', '15', 'years', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'considered', 'releasing', 'Moonlighting', 'DVD', 'music', 'was', 'unacceptable', 'Glenn', 'Caron', 'series', 'creator', 'Finally', 'obtained', 'necessary', 'rights', 'songs', 'so', 'greatly', 'enriched', 'wonderful', 'show', 'also', 'got', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Cybill', 'Sheperd', 'involved', 'DVD', 'extras', 'now', 'can', 'finally', 'see', 'result', 'hard', 'work']",Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2
893499,A36RM2S7UD5K2R,B0007XBMA2,"R. Whitney ""Ross Whitney""","[6, 12]","I ordered and received from Amazon Moonlighting Seasons 1, 2, and 3 in two different disc binders, each of which was sealed with shrink-wrap plastic. These containers, before they're opened, are very pretty to look at, with Bruce and Cybill shown as die-cut figures against the NYC skyline and an enormous harvest moon. (So far, so good).I discovered, however, once the plastic wrap was broken on the box containing 1 and 2, that the cardboard-and-plastic binder for the discs was extremely poorly designed and manufactured. When I opened the booklet, two of the plastic inserts holding discs pulled free from the thin cardboard spine acting as a hinge, and they clattered to the floor. I own hundreds of DVDs in just about every kind of DVD container ever designed. And this is probably the worst of the entire lot. The only thing securing the plastic inserts to the cardboard folder is a thin bead of what appears to be rubber cement, which I was able to pull free of the cardboard like a stretchy worm.I didn't view the videos and didn't open the second package. Within hours of receiving it in the mail, I attempted to return all of it for a refund. When I encountered resistance on the Amazon return site (which wouldn't provide a UPS return label), I phoned the company and explained the situation. The person I spoke to also resisted me, but after some discussion, he agreed to make it right and provide a refund. I certainly do understand that Amazon is not a free lending library for DVDs. I'm not at all sure that Amazon understands that a customer can have a truly valid reason for returning an opened DVD and requesting a full refund, or that the DVD container is just as much a part of the purchased product as the DVDs themselves.The only effective way to hold together the components of seasons 1 and 2, once they're opened and have fallen apart, is with several rubber bands. If you're fine with that kind of workaround, you may find the product to be a good bargain.

893504,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,B0007XBMA2,S. T. Peterson,"[0, 1]","This show was one of my favorites growing up . . . at least the first two seasons. I can remember watching the &#34;TV Movie&#34; that was the pilot. A lot of people now don't realize watching that that a CD Walkman around that time was a big technology innovation. That pilot episode definitely had and reminds me of the &#34;80s feel&#34;. Love it. Anyway the first two seasons were fun. They were fresh. But as we approached the third, fourth, and fifth seasons it was almost like the writers wanted to make people miserable. It was just plots designed to jerk the audience around. Also some say that it was because of a writer's strike. Obviously that is not true. Some say it was because Shepherd was pregnant. I never got that one. If she can have her parts &#34;in Chicago&#34; with the parents why not in LA? It was totally bad writing and bad writing decisions. I was turned off by then. It was only now all these years later that I have actually seen some of the later episodes and even know how it ended. And by that time Willis was a big movie star and rubbing elbows with Hollywood.

You knew from his first scene he was going to be a big star. He had charisma. Former model Maddie Hayes (Cybil Shepherd) wakes up one morning to discover her accountants have ripped her off. She's broke. All she has left are the businesses she invested in. Her lawyer advises her to visit each one, sell it or close it down to liquidate the assets and become solvent again. When she visits the City of Angels Detective Agency (later the Blue Moon Detective Agency) she tries to do the same thing. Only David Addison (Bruce Willis) the manager of the agency has other plans in mind. He woos Maddie convincing her to not only keep the agency open but gets her involved in their latest case and wets her appetite for the biz and man does she get a buzz out of it.Featuring top notch writing, direction and performances ""Moonlighting"" became a surprise hit for ABC. Unfortunately, by the 3rd season Willis and Shepherd were butting heads and the show had run into a creative dead end so ""Moonlighting"" became a hit series that experienced a brief, bright creative life and then faded away. Luckily, syndication kept the show alive for fans. Willis has gone on to bigger things and Shepherd has revived her several times since then but nothing could quite capture the magic of the original pairing and the first two marvelous seasons of the series.Lion's Gate has done an extensive restoration on ""Moonlighting"". The series looks and sounds better than most series from the early 80's. There's occasional analog defects in the form of dirt and noticeable grain in some episodes but, on the whole, the show looks sharp with vivid colors and images. Interestingly, some of the episodes here run a bit short which leads me to suspect that the syndicated versions were used for the set although I haven't seen the series in so long I don't know which ones they may have used. If that's the case, I would guess that it was inadvertent and they also probably went with whatever prints were available on the release time table they had for the series. The audio is also quite good and, although the box states it's stereo, I don't recall the series being broadcast that way. My guess is that stereo masters were prepared and then mixed down to mono for the original broadcast episodes. The dialog is occasionally muffled and flat sounding and the volume is also quite low for most of these episodes.We get three exceptional featurettes all of which have the participation of the original cast and/or crew of the series. ""Not Just a Day Job"" focuses on the creation of the show and the first season. There's interviews with Cybill Shepherd, creator/writer/producer Glenn Gordon Caron, director Robert Butler (who shot the pilot episode and, curiously shot many of the pilots for some of the most memorable shows from the 60's, 70's and 80's including ""Star Trek""), Bruce Willis, Allyce Beasley and the staff writers for the first season. It's quite a comprehensive look at what made the show so successful. ""Not Just a Day Job"" appears on the first disc of the set.""The Moonlighting Phenomenon focuses on the success of the show and its afterlife in syndication. A variety of folks from members of the Moonlighting Fan Club to creator Caron discussing why the show remains popular and has continued to resonate with fans. Caron discusses how he felt it was time to take the air out of detective shows which were ubiquitous on the networks during the 80's. Cybill Shepherd talks about the way that the show constantly broke down the TV ""4th wall"" cluing in the audience on the action and humor of the series pointing out that only certain characters (such as David Addison) could do it.  Willis is pretty quiet throughout the interview but does make a couple of pointed comments about the chemistry of the show. Allyce Beasley points out that the work load was on Shepard and Willis the most since the network saw them as the focus of the show. The resulting pressure created conflicts between the two stars but also created additional ""magic"" on the screen. Like Lennon & McCartney the two of them were perfect from the first moment together on screen.""Inside Blue Moon Detective Agency""  has Caron pointing out that the network was making a huge profit on the series and how he pushed to have money ploughed back into the series. He also resented doing 22 episodes a year and the pressure of doing the series like any other TV show. Caron's issue was that the show cost more than other TV series. The network's issue was the fact that the show didn't always make its airdate. They literally would finish some episodes  before the show was scheduled to air. Shepherd felt that the series was so dense that it was like shooting a movie on a TV schedule. The inside joke was that they would make it up in their shots driving the car. By the way, you can spot the fact that they were rarely ""driving"" during these scenes but the chemistry and magic was there so they kept it. We also discover how Caron ended up having Orson Welles introduce the infamous black and white episode. Sadly, Welles died one week after the episode was shot. It would have been a blast to have him direct or write one episode of the series even though he was at the end of his career.Commentary tracks are tricky to do effectively. Luckily, we get five here that are memorable and very well done. The pilot features Caron, pilot director Butler, producer Daniels, editor Mandelberg throwing out trivia throughout the entire 45 minute episode. ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice"" featuring Peter Werner, Debra Frank (co-writer of the episode) and Glenn Gordon Caron also ranks pretty highly up there. Still, for my money the best of the commentary tracks are those by Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis on ""Every Daughter is a Virgin"" and ""My Fair David"" respectively. The two reveal quite a bit about the day-to-day production of the series but also some their issues during production as well.A great 80's show that has aged very, very well, ""Moonlighting"" still has the magic. Lion's Gate has done a terrific job putting together this set. I'm happy to report they went to great lengths to restore the episodes here.  The extras are great here as are most of the commentary tracks. I didn't find the packaging as much of an issue as one reviewer and felt it was good overall (particularly when compared to many other boxed sets where the discs are released as dual sided and face each other in the set insuring they'll get scratched).",5,Classic show gets a classy presentation on DVD,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,6650,"['When', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'appeared', 'Moonlighting',
