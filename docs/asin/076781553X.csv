This movie is based on a 1920s book, and that message might seem resonant with the values of that era. But it's strange to listen to this kind of litany in a contemporary movie. To summarize the plot a bit, the film is about a young man, son of an unwed and stern woman, whose career is made almost impossible by his natural father, a thoroughly repellent individual, whose job seems to be to evict the poor from their homes when they can't pay their debts. The father tries every tactic to harass his son and to bring him into ruin and bankruptcy. What is most shocking is that the movie seems to imply that the father really loves his son, and all the wretched things he does to him are in order to build his character (hence the title) and become a successful person in society. Summing up, a well made movie with a message that seems a relic from a previous era.",3,"Generally well made movie, with dubious final message",1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,990,"['generally', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'very', 'dubious', 'message', 'best', 'way', 'raise', 'children', 'treat', 'garbage', 'movie', 'based', '1920s', 'book', 'message', 'might', 'seem', 'resonant', 'values', 'era', 'strange', 'listen', 'kind', 'litany', 'contemporary', 'movie', 'summarize', 'plot', 'bit', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'son', 'unwed', 'stern', 'woman', 'career', 'made', 'almost', 'impossible', 'natural', 'father', 'thoroughly', 'repellent', 'individual', 'job', 'be', 'evict', 'poor', 'homes', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'debts', 'father', 'tactic', 'harass', 'son', 'bring', 'ruin', 'bankruptcy', 'What', 'most', 'shocking', 'movie', 'imply', 'father', 'really', 'son', 'wretched', 'things', 'are', 'order', 'build', 'character', 'hence', 'title', 'become', 'successful', 'person', 'society', 'Summing', 'up', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'message', 'relic', 'previous', 'era']",N/A

The next thing you know the police are arresting him for killing this man.  At the time it looks all very possible.The story is then told by this defendant on what his relationship with this man is.  You quickly find out he is his father, but not in any traditional (except for biological) sense.This story is of an odd estranged relationship between a father and his son and the woman between them both.  The dynamic between all three is that of control.The mother, a taciturn woman was impregnated by her employer, a powerful representative of the court, the bailiff.  Basically he's the guy who does the dirty work, seizing property, notifying tenants of evictions etc.  He is a man who takes his level of control of the world for granted.  Well, there is one thing he does not control and it is this woman.  She takes this opportunity to wrest her small amount of control in the world from him and raises her son on her own.  Of course this bailiff is persistent in his efforts to gain control, but there is very little he can do.The son, grows up aware of who his father is at a distance and soon enough becomes a pawn, in his control games.  He comes by his own issues of control soon enough and as various situations develop, you see a parallel in their lives.I felt this movie was very well done.

12569,A5LNIF5QPQ0G6,076781553X,Brian A. Gross,"[7, 10]","Character, directed and adapted from novel by Mike van Diem, is an extraordinary example of why Hollywood is out of the loop when it comes to storytelling in film. It is also a paradigm of postmodernism that, at a time when Hollywood is the sludge export to the rest of the world, a Dutch film about a Depression-era family is so refreshing and well received.Dreverhaven. In the town that he works in as court bailiff, Arend Barend Dreverhaven (Jan Decleir) is a name feared by everyone; his son is no exception. Jacob Willhem (Feja Van Huet, who facially resembles Robert Downey Jr. and Rufus Sewell) is the illegitimate offspring of Dreverhaven and his housekeeper, Joba (Betty Schuurman). After the night Dreverhaven rapes her (supposedly, it is never made clear there was consent) and she learns of her pregnancy, Joba leaves him and raises the child on her own. She is a stern woman who refuses Dreverhaven's proposals of marriage. They are sent monthly with a check and the terse question: ""When is our wedding?""Jacob grows up with the shadow of his father's prominence around him and the cries of bastard in his ears. Joba is silent to the point of being mute and when he asks about his father he only gets the reply, ""We need nothing of him."" He eventually does stop proposing and keeps his eye on the boy and his mother from afar. His work, in early 20th century Netherlands, consisted mostly of evicting tenants from their homes and carrying out the unhappy law. It is not a cheery story and van Diem creates a darker visual aesthetic similar to Von Trier's Zentropa and Soderberg's Kafka. He is amazingly successful and the film is shot beautifully amongst the harshness of the story.Jacob's world changes when -- after an untimely move precipitated by his mother being taunted in the streets with ""whore"" -- he finds a sack of books left by the previous tenants. The knowledge they contain widens his world and he studies them constantly, caring for them like children. He learns English and works his way through the `T's' in his Encyclopedia (the last volume he has) but the cold faade of his mother does not melt at all.He has a quasi-ambition to strike out on his own but he is really trying to escape his mother. When he's summoned to a law office regarding his impending bankruptcy the place captures his imagination and he gains a job there through a forward maneuver amongst a management crisis. Once stable at the firm he remains determined to succeed and continues his law studies, taking time to shyly eye a beautiful French clerk named Lorna (Tamar van den Dop), but he's absorbed in the cat-and-mouse game he and his father play, keeping him in the forefront of his mind. When on the verge of another bankruptcy, the ruthless Dreverhaven comes again asking  for Joba's hand and she tells him she will never marry him. She asks him to leave the boy alone, but he responds ""...I'll strangle him for nine tenths and the last tenth will make him strong.""Against this backdrop of fear and stern affection, the characters make their life decisions. In one intense sequence Jacob goes to his father and presents him with the information that he is now a lawyer. He is empty inside because he has worked for so long and is still restless, and Dreverhaven knew he would be when he pushed him that hard. He extends a hand to the boy and incredulously he responds:""I cannot take the hand of someone who has worked against me my entire life.""""Or worked for you...""When Dreverhaven is found dead after this confrontation Jacob is taken into custody and questioned at length. Most of the story is told here, from the jail, in a wonderfully somber and methodical way. Character is a remarkable film that reminds me why I still find worth in sitting in a darkened theater with strangers for two hours.

In this instance, an extremely distant pair of parents and a young man seeking his identlty. It's also about great psychological drama, superior period design and unbelievably assured freshman filmmaking from director Mike Van Diem. It's also, as the title implies, about &quot;building character.&quot; The father, Dreverhaven, has some unusual character building techniques, to put it mildly. He at one point tells the young man's mother that he will strangle 9/10s of the life out of son Jacob, but the remaining 1/10ths will make him strong. And just for good measure, he may take the last tenth as welll.Jan Decleir, as Dreverhaven, is a revelation. He's built like Gerard Depardieu and is even more preposessing than that fine actor on screen. He would make a great Javert or Lear in some future production. Victor L&ouml;w, as Jacob's mentor and elder friend, De Gankeelar, is unlike anyone you will have seen on screen or stage. With an impossibly jutting jaw and unique mode of speech, he is the ultimate character actor. The entire cast is splendid. I'm not at all familiar with Dutch Cinema, and am not even entirely sure the term isn't an oxymoron. This film, however, can stand beside anything in contemporary cinema. Now I just have to dig up the novel by Ferdinand Borewijk, from which the movie was adapted.

Or at least that is how I took it, that it is about a man who wants more than anything, more than happiness in his own life, for his son to stand on his shoulders and go even farther in the world and he spends his life setting things up for his son to learn what he needs to learn so that he will be on top, a big success and so he can make sure his own offspring remain on top in society and have the greatest success Too. It is about striving to make sure that your LINE, survives and thrives. It ruins the life of the man who is the father, but the only thing he cares about is for his son to stand on his shoulders and go farther because he gave him all that was necessary in life to achieve. I believe that when you have children, that the most important thing in your life becomes making sure that they are successful in life and can take care of the next generation so that for generations, your offspring and their offspring and their offspring, and on and on, are successful people in life and all rise to the top, that they do not fail. To do this, to accomplish this in your lifetime parents often have to push and force children to educate themselves extremely well in order to have that success, before they even fully appreciate that it is necessary to do all the preparation IN Order to have the kind of life that will enable them to help their own offspring go on to school (for example) and prepare themselves to go on to greatness for the next generation and so on, so that a family line can remain on top in life over many many generations. This is about a man who understood what it takes to be on top and after he had a son, the only thing he cares about in life and felt a great obligation to, was his son, and to make sure that no matter what happened in life, after he was gone, that his son would be able to rise to the top and be successful and be able to take his own children and propell them to the top too. It is a very sad movie about what it takes and how some men care so much about accomplishing this most important goal in life that they sacrifice much in their own lives to get the end result. It takes place long ago and is a story of the ages.I LOVE This movie. Really, it is about a man who very deeply loves his son, and whose ONLY care in life is to make sure that his son stands on his shoulders and goes farther in life than he. While he is working toward this goal, the son is full of hate for his father, never understanding that it is from the deepest love for him that any father could ever have, that he has done everything he did in life. The father loves the son so much that ONLY the sons success in life matters to him, even if it ruins his own life, that his life is only for giving everything to his son. So it is about devotion to the offspring you create and going all the way to make sure that your child or children succeed in life. You do not understand the hated father until the end.A very powerful film and a story that has been going on for thousands of years in men who achieve greatness and who do Everything possible to make sure their line remains great. I think like this, understand this view and recognize that this is the path exceptionally strong and hugely successful men have taken in life over thousands of years.",5,ONE OF GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME!,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,3431,"['loved', 'movie', 'extent', 'man', 'make', 'sure', 'offspring', 'successful', 'life', 'gone', 'least', 'how', 'took', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'anything', 'more', 'happiness', 'own', 'life', 'son', 'stand', 'shoulders', 'go', 'even', 'farther', 'world', 'life', 'setting', 'things', 'up', 'son', 'learn', 'what', 'learn', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'top', 'big', 'success', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'sure', 'own', 'offspring', 'remain', 'top', 'society', 'have', 'greatest', 'success', 'Too', 'striving', 'make', 'sure', 'LINE', 'survives', 'thrives', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'father', 'only', 'thing', 'son', 'stand', 'shoulders', 'go', 'farther', 'gave', 'was', 'necessary', 'life', 'achieve', 'believe', 'when', 'have', 'children', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'making', 'sure', 'are', 'successful', 'life', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'next', 'generation', 'generations', 'offspring', 'offspring', 'offspring', 'are', 'successful', 'people', 'life', 'rise', 'top', 'do', 'not', 'fail', 'do', 'accomplish', 'lifetime', 'parents', 'often', 'have', 'push', 'force', 'children', 'educate', 'extremely', 'well', 'order', 'have', 'success', 'even', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'necessary', 'do', 'preparation', 'IN', 'Order', 'have', 'kind', 'life', 'will', 'enable', 'help', 'own', 'offspring', 'go', 'school', 'example', 'prepare', 'go', 'greatness', 'next', 'generation', 'so', 'family', 'line', 'can', 'remain', 'top', 'life', 'many', 'many', 'generations', 'man', 'who', 'understood', 'what', 'be', 'top', 'had', 'son', 'only', 'thing', 'life', 'felt', 'great', 'obligation', 'was', 'son', 'make', 'sure', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'life', 'was', 'gone', 'son', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'rise', 'top', 'be', 'successful', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'own', 'children', 'propell', 'top', 'too', 'very', 'sad', 'movie', 'what', 'how', 'men', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'accomplishing', 'most', 'important', 'goal', 'life', 'sacrifice', 'much', 'own', 'lives', 'get', 'end', 'result', 'place', 'long', 'ago', 'story', 'ages.I', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'Really', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'deeply', 'son', 'ONLY', 'care', 'life', 'make', 'sure', 'son', 'shoulders', 'farther', 'life', 'working', 'goal', 'son', 'full', 'hate', 'father', 'never', 'understanding', 'deepest', 'love', 'father', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'done', 'everything', 'did', 'life', 'father', 'son', 'so', 'much', 'ONLY', 'sons', 'success', 'life', 'matters', 'even', 'own', 'life', 'life', 'only', 'giving', 'everything', 'son', 'devotion', 'offspring', 'create', 'going', 'way', 'make', 'sure', 'child', 'children', 'succeed', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'hated', 'father', 'end.A', 'very', 'powerful', 'film', 'story', 'been', 'going', 'thousands', 'years', 'men', 'who', 'achieve', 'greatness', 'who', 'do', 'Everything', 'possible', 'make', 'sure', 'line', 'great', 'think', 'understand', 'view', 'recognize', 'path', 'exceptionally', 'strong', 'hugely', 'successful', 'men', 'have', 'taken', 'life', 'thousands', 'years']",N/A

As Jacob grows,the deafening silence that exists with his mother and now the involvement here and there with his father as a money lender increases Jacob's fierce and independent spirit to live free of both of them.This he continually finds impossible to do.The mother is austere and silent;the father is cruel and calculating;the son has terrible problems with both of them,yet is generally favored well by all of his coworkers.Things many times throughout this film come to a boil and the viewer is asked to consider the character motivation of each of the three principles, all the while realizing that the stress and strain is building Jacob into a strong and confidaent man.These are REAL and ALIVE and TREMENDOUSLY INTERESTING characters for those who love this kind of a film.It is nail-biting and tense,and yet has an underlying sweetness AND sadness about it.The film is first rate in all departments from it's look, to it's editing to a wonderful soundtrack by Het Paleis Van Boem.14 time nominee,4 time winner Jan Declair (ANTONIA""S LINE ,DAENS etc.) is the bailiff/tyrant Deverhoeven; Freja Van Huet portrays Jacob Willem and Betty Schuurman is Miss Katadreuffe.All three are multiple European actor winners.This is a first rate acting job in a first rate film.The fact that Award winning director has done nothing since CHARACTER is a mystery to me.Imdb stops his resume with his triumph here.1997 was a great year for films.Watch CHARACTER and you will surely agree.EXTREMELY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,"No one gives an inch in psychological twister ""Character""",1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,3456,"['visit', 'CHARACTER,1997', 'Foreign', 'film', 'Year', 'ever', 'so', 'often', 'never', 'tire', 'it.This', 'Netherlands-made', 'Mike', 'Van', 'Diem', 'written', 'directed', 'thriller', 'based', '1938', 'novel', 'entitled', 'Katadreuffe', 'und', 'Dreverhoeven', 'en', 'Karakter', 'fine', 'wine', 'deeper', 'more', 'character', 'complex', 'time', 'view', 'it.CHARACTER', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'fellow', 'epics', 'TITANIC', 'AND', 'AMISTAD', 'Foreign', 'category', 'CHARACTER', 'brought', 'home', 'Oscar', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'prior', 'Netherlands', 'film', 'amazing', 'ANTONIA', 'LINE', 'had', 'been', 'victorious.The', 'fact', 'CHARACTER', 'beat', 'out', 'SILENCE', 'Germany', 'FOUR', 'DAYS', 'IN', 'SEPTEMBER', 'Brazil', 'put', 'masterpiece', 'really', 'fine', 'company', 'INSUFFICIENTLY', 'stated', 'IMO', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'CHARACTER', 'really', 'three', 'way', 'struggle', 'Father', 'Son', 'Mother', 'battle', 'stubborn', 'pride', 'obsession', 'control.All', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'caught', 'cat-and-mouse', 'dog-eat-dog', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'set', '1923', 'Rotterdam.This', 'screenplay/book', 'right', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'mode', 'full', 'bleak', 'beginnings', 'endings', 'class', 'struggles', 'acceptance', 'greed', 'lust', 'pride', 'vengeance', 'particularly', 'reminiscent', 'Dickens', 'NICHOLAS', 'NICKLEBY', 'IMO.Will', 'good', 'come', 'suffering', 'Dreverhoeven', 'court', 'bailiff', 'who', 'Scroogesque', 'one', 'can', 'be.He', 'forecloses', 'everyone', 'blinking', 'eye.He', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'never', 'speaks', 'fornicates', 'why', 'are', 'never', 'certain', 'why', 'do', 'one', 'evening.Six', 'weeks', 'later', 'child', 'Miss', 'Katadreuffe', 'housekeeper.She', 'nothing', 'Dreverhoeven.He', 'marriage', '13', 'times', 'quietly', 'proudly', 'stubbornly', 'time.A', 'son', 'born', 'named', 'Jacob', 'Willem.He', 'glimpses', 'father', 'here', 'there', 'only', 'one', 'constant', 'thought', 'planted', 'brain', 'hardened', 'mother', 'have', 'need', 'nothing', 'Jacob', 'deafening', 'silence', 'mother', 'now', 'involvement', 'here', 'there', 'father', 'money', 'lender', 'Jacob', 'fierce', 'independent', 'spirit', 'live', 'free', 'them.This', 'continually', 'impossible', 'do.The', 'mother', 'austere', 'silent', 'father', 'cruel', 'calculating', 'son', 'terrible', 'problems', 'yet', 'generally', 'favored', 'well', 'coworkers.Things', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'come', 'boil', 'viewer', 'asked', 'consider', 'character', 'motivation', 'three', 'principles', 'while', 'realizing', 'stress', 'strain', 'building', 'Jacob', 'strong', 'confidaent', 'man.These', 'are', 'REAL', 'ALIVE', 'TREMENDOUSLY', 'INTERESTING', 'characters', 'who', 'love', 'kind', 'film.It', 'nail-biting', 'tense', 'yet', 'underlying', 'sweetness', 'AND', 'sadness', 'it.The', 'film', 'first', 'rate', 'departments', 'look', 'editing', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'Het', 'Paleis', 'Van', 'Boem.14', 'time', 'nominee,4', 'time', 'winner', 'Jan', 'Declair', 'ANTONIA', 'S', 'LINE', 'DAENS', 'etc', 'bailiff/tyrant', 'Deverhoeven', 'Freja', 'Van', 'Huet', 'Jacob', 'Willem', 'Betty', 'Schuurman', 'Miss', 'Katadreuffe.All', 'three', 'are', 'multiple', 'European', 'actor', 'winners.This', 'first', 'rate', 'acting', 'job', 'first', 'rate', 'film.The', 'fact', 'Award', 'winning', 'director', 'done', 'nothing', 'CHARACTER', 'mystery', 'me.Imdb', 'stops', 'resume', 'triumph', 'here.1997', 'was', 'great', 'year', 'films.Watch', 'CHARACTER', 'will', 'surely', 'agree.EXTREMELY', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

The acting is arresting and utterly convincing.  Each character represents heartbreak and tragedy.  Even the cold, hard father, Dreverhaven (brilliantly played by Jan Declier) is revealed to have a human side...albeit a terribly flawed and scarred humanity.  There is tremendous pathos in the final scenes between Dreverhaven and his son, Katadreuffe (the amazing Fedja van Huet). Even as Katadreuffe explodes in violence and rage, the sorrow and sense of loss is powerfully palpable.  Van Diem's direction is flawless.  He allows the actors to say so much without using many words.  The slow, steady pace allows the plot to simmer before reaching a boil.  The longing between Katadreuffe and his lovely co-worker is incredibly heartrending.  Katadreuffe's complex relationships with his mother and his mentor are also quite striking.  Van Diem gets the most out of very simple gestures...a look, a smile, a touch...perhaps the most dramatic and emotional moment in the film is when Dreverhaven extends his hand to Katadreuffe or when he later whispers, ""Help me, Jacob.""  Reviewers have invoked Kafka, Dickens, Shakespeare, and Oedipus in attempting to describe this film.  All of those apply, and I don't think it's a stretch to say that this film belongs in the worthy company of those great stories. (Let me say that the father-son relationship here reminds me in a strange way of a certain famous Johnny Cash song, though I will let you guess which one.)

12582,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,076781553X,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 2]","It's unclear who ""Character"" - which otherwise tells the story of a luckless man locked in battle with his biological father - refers to.  Set in Europe after the first world war, ""Character"" presents us with a fearsome figure: Arend Dreverhaven (Jan Declair), the local ""Bailiff"".  In uncertain times, when nobody can be sure how long they'll have a job or a roof over their head, Dreverhaven fearlessly and contemptuously wields his power to divest whole communities of both.  Physically large, he can stare down whole battalions of armed communists single-handedly, or jump into the sea to re-possess a ship.  (In a chilling dream sequence, he evicts an entire building's tenants wearing no more than his bailiff's medal.)  In a lesser film, Dreveraven would be easy to dismiss as a coward, cloaking his weakness behind the power of the office, but ""Character"" goes a braver route - Dreverhaven has his fears, but he's still the power behind the position.  He's driven to possess the one thing he can't get - the love of Joba, his former housekeeper and the one woman who slept with him.  Though the script is murky on whether Joba consented to their coupling, she makes it crystal clear that she wants nothing to do with him - whether for herself or their ""son"".  Proving she's as strong willed as Dreverhaven, she coldly rebuffs his efforts to control or support them, especially the pathological way he repeatedly proposes to her over the years - even as the two enter the inescapable redoubt of old age.  Not taking ""no"" for answer very well, Dreverhaven wages a war against Jacob Willem, the illegitimate son who will rise into respectable manhood by dint of serious labor.Though already having the world against him, (poverty and bastardy are bad enough alone) Jacob finds himself under the gun.  Dreverhaven buys up Jacob's debts, hounding the boy into poverty.  Jacob rises to the occasion - he defeats Dreverhaven in bankruptcy court, twice.  He even nabs a job as a clerk in the town's house of finance, a move with potential for a respectable and lucrative future, light years away from the wretched existence into which he was born.  Unfortunately, Willem too is driven by fear and hatred of the old man - having just redeemed his last debts to Dreverhaven, he boldly incurs a new one, relishing the chance to beat the old man again.  He also confuses success with happiness, discarding a pretty fellow worker whose affections offer him nothing in his private war.  Dreverhaven's motives are unclear - though the script ingeniously works this dilemma into the story.  Dreverhaven boldly tells Joba that he'll strangle his son for nine-tenths to make a man out of him, since that's the only way he can legitimize Jacob Willem as his son.  He obviously wants Joba, but only if he can make their boy into a mirror image of himself.  When Joba rebuffs him one last time, however, he decides it's time to go after that last 10th.  Unfortunately, for both our heroes and the story, Joba soon dies, a move that robs the story of its emotional force and complexity, and boils it down to a clash of wills in which both characters go after that last bit of their lives left un-strangled.  It's no surprise who survives the other - the script is based on Jacob's ""confession"" to the police after the old man is found dead in the solitary gloom of his office, after a fight Jacob admits the two had.While serious film lovers see it as an alternative to Hollywood sludge (another reviewer wrote that, I didn't make it up), the film's theme of ""father v. son"" is pure Hollywood.  The script's sub-text of an evil-elder figure who elevates a younger hero by making his life hell was already old when Willem Defoe used it in ""Spiderman"". (James Earle Jones used it against Mark Hamill in the ""Star Wars"" movies and against Schwarzennegar in the first ""Conan"" flick - and that was over 20 years ago!)  Also, the film's obviously high production values means it will never be a favorite with the Dogme set.  That said, ""Character"" gives us the timeless Oedipal battle with less than heroic figures.  When Jacob's mother coolly condemns him for missing out on a chance for love, it sounds mean, but we all know she's right.

12583,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,076781553X,Turfseer,"[4, 5]","'Character' is a Dutch film which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1998. The film begins as a young man, Jacob Katadreuffe, has been arrested on the suspicion of murdering Dreverhaven, a powerful and much feared bailiff in the city of Rotterdam. Katadreuffe is interrogated by the police and the recounting of his story forms a voice-over narration for the rest of the film.We flashback to the early 1920s as Katadreuffe relates that his mother, Joba, was Dreverhaven's housekeeper. They have a very brief affair but she decides to raise the child on her own since he is a cruel man who she cannot relate to. Nonetheless, Dreverhaven is persistent in trying to get Joba to change her mind. He sends an emissary laden with cash begging her to marry him but each time she rejects his entreaties.Finally Dreverhaven gives up and Joba is left to raise little Jacob on her own. Oddly, she has no fondness for the boy and throughout his childhood and adolescence she hardly says a word to him.'Character' has a few powerful scenes in its expository sequences. First we discover just how cruel a man Dreverhaven is. When he comes to evict a family who are behind on their rent, he finds an extremely sick woman inside the apartment and ends up dragging her out of bed and throws her out into the street. In another powerful scene, Katadreuffe is arrested with a group of other boys for stealing some bread and is almost raped by a pederast police officer inside a juvenile detention center.It should be noted that when Katadreuffe is detained, he tells the police that Dreverhaven is his father. But when questioned, Dreverhaven denies knowing the boy. Hence, at the outset, we wonder why the Dreverhaven rejects his son. Is he trying to get back at the mother who won't marry him? It's never really explained.Katadreuffe's 'call to adventure' begins when he finally becomes a young man. He's still living with his mother and decides that he must strike out on his own. He takes out a loan from a credit company and impulsively buys a cigar shop without checking the inventory. He soon discovers that the inventory, boxes of cigars, are filled with nothing but straw. One wonders why Katadreuffe didn't bother to inspect the inventory before purchasing the business. After this fiasco, Katadreuffe is forced to go back to live with his mother.Katadreuffe keeps pushing forward. He manages to land a job as an assistant to an attorney, Stroomkoning, at a law firm utilizing his English skills which he learned as a child studying an old encyclopedia. Soon after, Katadreuffe discovers that the credit company he borrowed the money from belongs to Dreverhaven. Katadreuffe is now in debt to his father who interestingly enough allows him to pay off his debts in installments. During the first go-round, he proves to his father that he's an honorable guy and pays off the debt as money is garnered from his pay check.Most of 'Act 2"" of 'Character' deals with Katadreuffe attempt to better his position within the law firm. He's attracted to Stroomkoning's secretary, Miss Te George, but due to his bitterness over the poor relationship with his father, he never works up the courage to hook up with her. The film's B story doesn't seem to go anywhere when Te George eventually leaves the firm and nothing comes of their relationship.Katadreuffe is eventually offered the position of office manager within the firm. Inexplicably, he asks Dreverhaven for another loan which he uses for tutoring to become a full-fledged attorney. The loan has one proviso: Dreverhaven can call it in at anytime. He does so just as Katadreuffe is about to take his exams. To Katadreuffe's horror, it's revealed that he failed to pay an earlier debt consisting of his 15 guilder collection of old books (including the encyclopedia). Stroomkoning comes to his rescue, convincing the bankruptcy court that the debt was merely a gift.Meanwhile, Dreverhaven, the cruel, obsessed bailiff, has never given up hope that Joba will accept his proposition (why he still wants to marry her after all this time is never explained). He visits her again after all these years and she turns him down on cue. This fuels his monstrous rage and he's off evicting as many poor tenants he can find. He's so obsessed that he serves a notice of eviction to a Communist who's in the middle of firefight with the police.In her old age, Joba becomes a little more talkative and chides Katadreuffe for not going after Lorna Te George. Joba soon dies and Dreverhaven has a soft spot in his heart and attends her funeral.The climax of 'Character' is unsatisfying. We expect Dreverhaven to do something shattering that leads Katadreuffe to confront him in the final scene. But it's nothing more than his graduation from law school and acceptance into the firm that propels him to the final confrontation with his father (Katadreuffe remarks that he ""knew all along"" that his father had been ""waiting"" for him).Father and son are both bloodied as they duke it out at Dreverhaven's place of employment. Dreverhaven ends up dead but the police conclude that Dreverhaven committed suicide and let Katadreuffe go.'Character' is fairly absorbing until the Third Act Climax. The film is helped immensely by the brooding, noirish musical score. Although we never really find out what makes Dreverhaven tick, it's suggested that he was merely using 'tough love' as a means of building his son's character (Dreverhaven ends up ceding his entire estate to his son and signs his will ""Father"" to boot). ""Character' is a melodrama with a nice look to it which will keep you engaged for most of its two hours. But the motivations of its 'characters' (especially Dreverhaven) are not always convincingly defined.",3,'Character' keeps your interest but its 'characters' remain unconvincingly

12584,A36NF437WZLQ9E,076781553X,W. Powell,"[1, 1]","The flawed characters give this mysterious movie its brilliant flavor.  A silent mother, a cold, unfeeling father and a son trying desperately to win their love and approval. The movie ""Character"" marches its viewing audience along a grief stricken, no thrills scenic route.  The booming musical score gives the feeling of a quickening downhill death march where you know you must soon face the powerful enemy, to the death. But what if the enemy is you?It's a movie that captures your attention with a questionable circumstance, then whisks you along toward the climaxing conclusion that may hold the answers. It thrives on unfulfiilled ambitions, desires, loves and needs.  The lead actors play their roles to perfection, but I must point out two of the supporting cast members who bring out the flavor of the story with their unique seasonings.  Look for Lorna and De Gankelaar to add a few dashes of colorful spice to what might otherwise be a bland and tiresome stew.  Though the main struggle appears to be between father and son, you can't help but see the struggles many characters have with themselves and their choices.
