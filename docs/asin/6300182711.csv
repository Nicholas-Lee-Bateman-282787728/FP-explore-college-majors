202126,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6300182711,Dennis Littrell,"[9, 10]","Although this is not a great film it is a lot better than its reputation.  Jack Nicholson is excellent and Harvey Keitel is very good.  The beautiful and beguiling Mexican actress, Elpidia Carrillo, handles a limited role with enough artistry to make me wonder why I never heard of her before.  Turns out she does have a healthy list of credits both internationally and in the US.The direction by Tony Richardson, who had his heyday in the sixties with films as varied as The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962), Tom Jones (1963), and The Loved One (1965), all adapted from novels, is at times inspired and artistic, and at other times as ordinary as dishwater.  I don't think he was able to make up his mind while directing this film about whether he wanted win an award at Cannes or Venice or to just sell some tickets.  As it turns out he did neither as well as he might have.  Nonetheless as a snapshot of poor Mexican immigrants (and would-be immigrants) as they clash with the border patrol culture twenty-some years ago The Border is definitely worth a look.  Particularly vivid is the depiction of the absurdities and hypocrisies among the coyotes, the ""wets,"" the border patrol rank-and-file, the law and the realities of life along both sides of the thin strip separating the promised land from the third world.Nicholson plays Charlie Smith, a border patrol cop with a trailer trash wife (Valerie Perrine) who yearns to move up to the luxury of duplex living.  In particular she wants to move in next door to her high school girlfriend Savannah (Shannon Wilcox) who is married to the ""Cat"" (Harvey Keitel).  Charlie Smith is a bit of an innocent who was satisfied with his trailer home and his sexy, loving, but not overly sharp, wife Mary.  When they do pick up and move to Texas he runs headlong into the corrupt lifestyle of the Cat and the cruel realities of his job which consists of arresting illegal immigrants and sending them back to Mexico.  Meanwhile Mary isn't just sitting home twiddling her thumbs.  Instead she is out buying water beds and dinette sets, overstuffed chairs and sofas, and other knickknacks that put a strain on the couple's budget which leads Charlie into temptation.  But when taking kickbacks turns to murder, Charlie draws the line in the sand (literally as it happens) and he and the Cat have a rather rude falling out.  Meanwhile Charles spots Carrillo as the lovely Maria with babe in arms and a little brother at her side.  Predictably the system cruelly exploits her, bringing Charlie to her rescue.I think the striking contrast between Charlie's air-headed Mary and the desperate and needy Maria needed to be further explored.  As it was played Charlie is just a good joe doing a good deed or two when in fact we know he is much more involved than that.  I think the movie would have been improved by making him choose between the two women as he had to make the moral choice between going with the Cat's corruption or going against him.See this for Jack Nicholson, one of the great actors of our time, who brings subtlety and veracity to a role that could have been ordinary, while giving us only a hint of the commanding and irreverent style that he would adopt in later years.",4,"Underrated and overlooked, but definitely worthwhile",1063238400,"09 11, 2003",2003,3239,"['not', 'great', 'film', 'lot', 'better', 'reputation', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'excellent', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'very', 'good', 'beautiful', 'beguiling', 'Mexican', 'actress', 'Elpidia', 'Carrillo', 'limited', 'role', 'enough', 'artistry', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'out', 'have', 'healthy', 'list', 'credits', 'internationally', 'US.The', 'direction', 'Tony', 'Richardson', 'who', 'had', 'heyday', 'sixties', 'films', 'as', 'varied', 'Loneliness', 'Long', 'Distance', 'Runner', '1962', 'Tom', 'Jones', '1963', 'Loved', 'One', '1965', 'all', 'adapted', 'novels', 'times', 'inspired', 'artistic', 'other', 'times', 'as', 'ordinary', 'dishwater', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'directing', 'film', 'wanted', 'win', 'award', 'Cannes', 'Venice', 'just', 'sell', 'tickets', 'out', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'have', 'Nonetheless', 'snapshot', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'immigrants', 'would-be', 'immigrants', 'clash', 'border', 'patrol', 'culture', 'twenty-some', 'years', 'Border', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'Particularly', 'vivid', 'depiction', 'absurdities', 'hypocrisies', 'coyotes', 'wets', 'border', 'patrol', 'rank-and-file', 'law', 'realities', 'life', 'sides', 'thin', 'strip', 'separating', 'promised', 'land', 'third', 'world.Nicholson', 'plays', 'Charlie', 'Smith', 'border', 'patrol', 'cop', 'trailer', 'trash', 'wife', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'who', 'move', 'up', 'luxury', 'duplex', 'living', 'particular', 'move', 'next', 'door', 'high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'Savannah', 'Shannon', 'Wilcox', 'who', 'married', 'Cat', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Charlie', 'Smith', 'bit', 'innocent', 'who', 'was', 'satisfied', 'trailer', 'home', 'sexy', 'loving', 'not', 'overly', 'sharp', 'wife', 'Mary', 'When', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'move', 'Texas', 'headlong', 'corrupt', 'lifestyle', 'Cat', 'cruel', 'realities', 'job', 'arresting', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'sending', 'back', 'Mexico', 'Meanwhile', 'Mary', ""n't"", 'just', 'sitting', 'home', 'twiddling', 'thumbs', 'Instead', 'out', 'buying', 'water', 'beds', 'dinette', 'sets', 'overstuffed', 'chairs', 'sofas', 'other', 'knickknacks', 'put', 'strain', 'couple', 'budget', 'Charlie', 'temptation', 'when', 'taking', 'kickbacks', 'murder', 'Charlie', 'line', 'sand', 'literally', 'Cat', 'have', 'rather', 'rude', 'falling', 'out', 'Meanwhile', 'Charles', 'spots', 'Carrillo', 'lovely', 'Maria', 'babe', 'arms', 'little', 'brother', 'side', 'Predictably', 'system', 'cruelly', 'bringing', 'Charlie', 'rescue.I', 'think', 'striking', 'contrast', 'Charlie', 'air-headed', 'Mary', 'desperate', 'needy', 'Maria', 'needed', 'be', 'further', 'explored', 'was', 'played', 'Charlie', 'just', 'good', 'joe', 'doing', 'good', 'deed', 'two', 'when', 'fact', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'involved', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'making', 'choose', 'two', 'women', 'had', 'make', 'moral', 'choice', 'going', 'Cat', 'corruption', 'going', 'him.See', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'great', 'actors', 'time', 'who', 'subtlety', 'veracity', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ordinary', 'giving', 'only', 'hint', 'commanding', 'irreverent', 'style', 'would', 'adopt', 'later', 'years']",N/A

Elpidia Carrillo (Predator) is excellent in her first American (though still mostly non-English) role. Unfortunately, all-star character actors Harvey Keitel and Warren Oates are woefully underutilized. Nicholson as the border patrol agent with a conscience is compelling, though seeing him find his moral compass is reminiscent of J.J. Gittes in the eminently more watchableChinatown. On a macro level, The Border disappoints because of its lackluster editing and what I fear is an unnaturally ""happy"" ending. Ultimately, what we have here is a stellar acting performance in an average film, which does not invite multiple viewings.

And he refuses to go along with it.  At the same time, the story is interwoven with that of a young refugee played by the very talented Elpidia Carillo who is trying to enter the U.S. to seek work.  The greatest part of this film is to watch Nicholson reject not only the Border Patrol's corruption but the vapid Anglo life and culture that he falls into in El Paso in favor of the more humble but honest and vibrant Mexican way of life.  One of the few times in the film that he smiles is when he does a good deed at the end of the movie for the Mexican woman.

And he just may be right about that.  His performance as a good, simple man who's caught up in the pressures of corruption and material life is perfect.  Tony Richardson, director of such diverse films as Blue Sky and Tom Jones, knows how to keep the focus on his characters rather than on the superficial bulls**t that so often marks films these days.  The supporting cast includes Harvey Keital, Warren Oates, and Valerie Perrine, and they, along with the remaining cast, are just as great as Nicholson is.Keitel plays Cat, a fellow border patrol officer and Charlie's (Nicholson's) neighbor and so-called friend.  Cat, the C.O. (Oates), a crude lowlife Texan, and a sleazy Mexican are all in on a corrupt scheme to sell wetbacks (Mexican laborers in the U.S.) for profit.  When murder becomes part of the mix, Charlie--who had finally agreed to cash in--backs out and the others turn on him.  He helps a young Mexican woman whose baby has been snatched and meanwhile tries to put up with his greedy wife (Perrine) who loves material objects more than life itself.For some very strange reason, this film has sunk so far into the depths of obscurity that no one seems interested in releasing this on DVD.  This is a great dramatic work and showcases not only Nicholson himself, but a story that means something, a director who knows how to do what has to be done, and a film whose emphasis is where it should be--on story and characters, not on shallow emotions that can be resolved with the snap of a special effects finger.Very highly recommended.",4,"Great film, great Nicholson",1061596800,"08 23, 2003",2003,1692,"['one', 'point', 'career', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'mentioned', 'films', ""'d"", 'done', 'thought', 'Border', 'was', 'best', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'performance', 'good', 'simple', 'man', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'pressures', 'corruption', 'material', 'life', 'perfect', 'Tony', 'Richardson', 'director', 'such', 'diverse', 'films', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'how', 'keep', 'focus', 'characters', 'rather', 'superficial', 'bulls**t', 'so', 'often', 'films', 'days', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Harvey', 'Keital', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'remaining', 'cast', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'Nicholson', 'is.Keitel', 'plays', 'Cat', 'fellow', 'border', 'patrol', 'officer', 'Charlie', 'Nicholson', 'neighbor', 'so-called', 'friend', 'Cat', 'C.O', 'Oates', 'crude', 'lowlife', 'Texan', 'sleazy', 'Mexican', 'are', 'corrupt', 'scheme', 'sell', 'wetbacks', 'Mexican', 'laborers', 'U.S.', 'profit', 'When', 'murder', 'part', 'mix', 'Charlie', 'who', 'had', 'finally', 'agreed', 'cash', 'backs', 'out', 'others', 'turn', 'young', 'Mexican', 'woman', 'baby', 'been', 'snatched', 'meanwhile', 'tries', 'put', 'up', 'greedy', 'wife', 'Perrine', 'who', 'material', 'objects', 'more', 'life', 'itself.For', 'very', 'strange', 'reason', 'film', 'sunk', 'so', 'far', 'depths', 'obscurity', 'one', 'interested', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'great', 'dramatic', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'Nicholson', 'story', 'something', 'director', 'who', 'how', 'do', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'film', 'emphasis', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'story', 'characters', 'not', 'shallow', 'emotions', 'can', 'be', 'resolved', 'snap', 'special', 'effects', 'finger.Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

I can't think of a single illegal among the many I've known who hasn't created a more secure and satisyfing life ""across the borderline."" You can bet that the scriptwriters, the director, and producer of The Border spent a lot of their time with illegals, perhaps most especially their maids.Most offensively, the film is an insult to the illegals. The people who made this film had to have believed that illegal immigrants were imbeciles who didn't bother to learn anything about conditions in the U.S. before coming to the country, and then returning if they were caught and deported.

Itrefers to wetbacks, pepper bellies, a 3 mile fence, coyotes, gourdheads, etc.Here, Nicholson is told to turn a blind eye to alien cargos deliveredto needy fruit and vegetable crop producers in the USA, and toindustrial base owners who rely on below minimum wage workers tomaximize profits. He is also told to accept as business taking outindependent and rival gang drug traffickers. There's  holding a babyfor randsom in the form of an annuity. He has trouble in dealing withall this, from his inexperience in life, prior training, and fromdifferent behaviors required in normal police environments.Keeping the lid on the jar of corruption is a tough job, parallel tothe actual work officers do, as Nicholson, Keitel struggle to keepthe money flows going between all interested parties, especiallythemselves, and to their wives, who are phenomenal spenders ( such asunderground pool, waterbed, new home, etc.) who pile on them afinancial pressure without giving it any second thoughts. This iscritique on consumerism, of the affluence of American society. Thewife says "" Don't worry about paying it back! I opened a charge cardaccount at the merchant"" suggesting credit cards debt is not  a truedebt.Interestingly, Keitel quickly carries out a strategy to keepNicholson under his thumb, by framing him for manslaughter,potentially charged unless the latter cooperates, and goes along withtotal obedience to what the former describes as ""real big money onthe table, how each must take care of their own, that something'sgood is going on, because things are different down here, and theneed to sit on the right horse from the start.""The downside is the perpetuation of the stereotype of the illiteratepeasant Mexican, either on the take if a man, or a prostitute if awoman, with others looking to live a new life in the USA. The cheesy1970's era pickup trucks and clunkers are perhaps the only aspectthat makes the picture truely dated.The best cinematography was obviously done in the outdoors,especially action scenes filmed with a pleasing clarity, while theindoor ones are suprisingly average, boorish. The true widescreenaspect, however, is welcomed in either case.The music oftentimes is wholly inappropriate, with Ry Cooder, playinghis acoustic traditional guitar, and other times, slide guitar duringaction, or life-and-death sequences for example, suggesting a perhapsone-trick-pony type of audio he's able to come up with, identical tohis Paris, TX colaboration.Overall, BORDER is a courageous picture, interesting, with a gooddose of action and excitement, balanced out equally with mellow,vulnerable human behavior that tells the tale of a struggle betweencharacter and doing what's right against profit-minded, one-trackminded opportunists.",3,"A courageous picture, a good dose of action  balanced  with human vulnerability",1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,3470,"['BORDER', '1982', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'taking', 'onthe', 'roles', 'US', 'Border', 'Patrol', 'officers', 'Mexico', 'were', 'optimalchoices', 'individualism', 'charisma', 'proven', 'crowd-drawingcapabilities', 'theatres.The', 'theme', 'touched', 'trafficking', 'humans', 'cattleacross', 'border', 'poor', 'conditions', 'aliens', 'obviouslymore', 'current', 'even', '25', 'years', 'later.Its', 'strength', 'immense', 'realism', 'battle', 'embracingone', 'true', 'character', 'doing', 'what', 'one', 'naturally', 'rightthing', 'do', 'often', 'line', 'law', 'weighed', 'thestruggle', 'please', 'boss', 'co-exist', 'existing', 'loco', 'corruption', 'payoffs', 'occurring', 'patrol', 'officer', 'workforce', 'Itrefers', 'wetbacks', 'pepper', 'bellies', '3', 'mile', 'fence', 'coyotes', 'gourdheads', 'etc.Here', 'Nicholson', 'told', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'alien', 'cargos', 'deliveredto', 'needy', 'fruit', 'vegetable', 'crop', 'producers', 'USA', 'toindustrial', 'base', 'owners', 'who', 'rely', 'minimum', 'wage', 'workers', 'tomaximize', 'profits', 'also', 'told', 'accept', 'business', 'taking', 'outindependent', 'rival', 'gang', 'drug', 'traffickers', 'holding', 'babyfor', 'randsom', 'form', 'annuity', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'withall', 'inexperience', 'life', 'prior', 'training', 'fromdifferent', 'behaviors', 'required', 'normal', 'police', 'environments.Keeping', 'lid', 'jar', 'corruption', 'tough', 'job', 'parallel', 'tothe', 'actual', 'work', 'officers', 'do', 'Nicholson', 'Keitel', 'struggle', 'keepthe', 'money', 'going', 'interested', 'parties', 'especiallythemselves', 'wives', 'who', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'spenders', 'such', 'pool', 'waterbed', 'new', 'home', 'etc', 'who', 'pile', 'afinancial', 'pressure', 'giving', 'second', 'thoughts', 'iscritique', 'consumerism', 'affluence', 'American', 'society', 'Thewife', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'paying', 'back', 'opened', 'charge', 'cardaccount', 'merchant', 'suggesting', 'credit', 'cards', 'debt', 'not', 'truedebt.Interestingly', 'Keitel', 'quickly', 'out', 'strategy', 'keepNicholson', 'thumb', 'framing', 'manslaughter', 'potentially', 'charged', 'latter', 'cooperates', 'along', 'withtotal', 'obedience', 'what', 'former', 'describes', 'real', 'big', 'money', 'onthe', 'table', 'how', 'must', 'take', 'care', 'own', ""something'sgood"", 'going', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'down', 'here', 'theneed', 'sit', 'right', 'horse', 'start', 'downside', 'perpetuation', 'stereotype', 'illiteratepeasant', 'Mexican', 'either', 'take', 'man', 'prostitute', 'awoman', 'others', 'looking', 'live', 'new', 'life', 'USA', 'cheesy1970', 'era', 'pickup', 'trucks', 'clunkers', 'are', 'perhaps', 'only', 'picture', 'truely', 'dated.The', 'best', 'cinematography', 'was', 'obviously', 'done', 'outdoors', 'especially', 'action', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'pleasing', 'clarity', 'theindoor', 'ones', 'are', 'suprisingly', 'average', 'boorish', 'true', 'widescreenaspect', 'however', 'welcomed', 'case.The', 'music', 'oftentimes', 'wholly', 'inappropriate', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'acoustic', 'traditional', 'guitar', 'other', 'times', 'slide', 'guitar', 'duringaction', 'life-and-death', 'sequences', 'example', 'suggesting', 'perhapsone-trick-pony', 'type', 'audio', 'able', 'come', 'up', 'identical', 'tohis', 'Paris', 'TX', 'colaboration.Overall', 'BORDER', 'courageous', 'picture', 'interesting', 'gooddose', 'action', 'excitement', 'balanced', 'out', 'equally', 'mellow', 'vulnerable', 'human', 'behavior', 'tale', 'struggle', 'betweencharacter', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'profit-minded', 'one-trackminded', 'opportunists']",N/A

202138,A16QODENBJVUI1,6300182711,Robert Moore,"[5, 6]","Of all Jack Nicholson's finest performances, this is without question the least rarely seen.  Although Nicholson can excel at over-the-top performances, in many of his greatest, he goes to the opposite extreme.  In this one, he rarely expresses emotion, rarely smiles, and instead communicates a simmering, barely contained rage at life and himself for having settled for being so much less than he ought and would like to be.  By the end of the movie, he discovers that he has become a person he really doesn't want to know.Told parallel to the story of Nicholson's descent into corruption is a Mexican woman who clearly wants to cross the physical borderline (just as Nicholson in the film has clearly crossed the moral borderline) with her baby to try and find a better life for him and her.  Over and over we confront her and her trials, until her destiny becomes entwined with Jack Nicholson near the end of the film when he has to decide whether he will help her and run up against the other corrupt cops, or lose whatever tiny bit of self-respect he has left.  The quiet, understated dynamic between their two stories is beautifully contrasted with the tawdriness of the lives of the border cops.There are so many positives about this film: an incredible supporting cast, including Valerie Perrine as Nicholson's grasping, materialistic wife, Harvey Keitel as the corrupt border guard who pulls Nicholson into, and Warren Oates as a thoroughly despicable associate.  I am not sure of the name of the young Mexican girl, but I love the innocence and yearning that she manages to project.  The soundtrack is extraordinary, with one superb musical sequence after another by Ry Cooder, capped off by Freddy Fender's vocal on the Cooder-written ""The Borderline.""The film is somewhat predictable, but, you know, I find that nearly all films are.

There were great expectations for this back in 1982 - a script co-written by The Wild Bunch's Walon Green, Jack Nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast (Harvey Keitel, Warren Oates, Valerie Perrine), Tony Richardson directing (although he was pretty much a spent force by then) - but now it doesn't even turn up on TV. The material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s American Dreams 80s of capitalism and conspicuous consumption, with Nicholson's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife's relentless materialism, until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business. Unfortunately, he never really gets his hands dirty, barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface. The film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and, sadly, the recent DVD release is a missed opportunity to restore the original, nihilistic ending where Nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film's trailers.While that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low-key Nicholson's crisis of conscience is in the film, it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point he's holding characters at gunpoint, then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him, one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the Rio Grande while Valerie Perrine's character gets dumber on an exponential level. The villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease (and one impressive car stunt) in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely. What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring. Unfortunately Ry Cooder's beautiful title song, Across the Borderline, says it all much more economically. But if you want to know the film's real crime, it's completely wasting the great Warren Oates in a nothing bit part. When even he can't make an impression, you know something's really wrong.
