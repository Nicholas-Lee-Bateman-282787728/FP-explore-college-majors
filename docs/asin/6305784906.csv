477815,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6305784906,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[0, 2]","This flick has almost everything a true Bond fan would die for.  Great locations, wonderful special effects, spare-no-expense stunts, beautiful women, and of course Pierce Brosnan.  The plot's pretty good, too, as it  finds a way to involve The Russians in a plausible Post-Cold War scenario  that is just real enough to be scary.What bothered me about the movie  was its formulaic feel.  The action scenes came at too regular intervals.  There was a major action scene before the title credits; then we're into  the film.  A few minutes later of course, another action scene.  Then they  come at regular intervals.  It gets to the point where anyone who has seen  these movies before can predict when something is going to happen and  usually who's going to be behind it.  I'm not saying I had the whole movie  figured out from the beginning, but there was an element of shock and  surprise missing from the film; it was just too conservative in the way it  played out.

477816,A35JE1NQ0HL8RQ,6305784906,A. Macphee,"[0, 0]","I liked this nineteenth Bond flick which had a good cast- Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Dame Judie Dench, the late, great Desmond Llewelyn, John Cleese, and Robbie Coltrane.  But the list stops there.  Why, oh why did they pick Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist of all  things!  She even challenges Talisa Soto(LICENSE TO KILL)as worst Bond  girl.  I would have liked to have seen Denise and Sophie exchange roles.  Then they would have been much better suited for each other.The opening  sequence involving the boat chase was excellent!, as was the introduction  to &quot;R&quot;.  As Skiing sequences go in Bond movies, this one was OK,  but my fave is still where this film gets its title- ON HER MAJESTY'S  SECRET SERVICE.I was glad to see Coltrane back- and loved the leg joke  he did on Bond later on!  Carlyle turned out a good performance too, but  wasn't in the movie as much as I thought he would be.  he turned out to be  more of a pawn to Elektra.The BMW seemed to be there just for show this  time, and was only used once for gadgets, which is, lets face it, what we  want to see.As for the DVD extras, I liked the explanations of the  stunts, similar to the &quot;Follow the white rabbit&quot; on The Matrix  DVD, and the Making of TWINE could have been a little longer, IMHO.  The  other Makings of... were much better made.  Anything by Shirley Manson and  garbage is always welcome by me!  Two things- One is no English  subtitles(same as on the majority of The James Bond Gift Set 2).  This gets  to me because when I have the commentary option on, I like to know what's  going on in the movie, and subtitles is the only way.  Secondly- as it is  with all Bond DVDs, there are no bios on the main characters.  I think this  would make a great addition.All in all, a great film, but we shall miss  you, Desmond...",4,Orbis non sufficit,964137600,"07 21, 2000",2000,1853,"['liked', 'nineteenth', 'Bond', 'flick', 'had', 'good', 'cast-', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Dame', 'Judie', 'Dench', 'late', 'great', 'Desmond', 'Llewelyn', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'list', 'there', 'Why', 'oh', 'why', 'did', 'pick', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'things', 'even', 'Talisa', 'Soto', 'LICENSE', 'TO', 'KILL', 'worst', 'Bond', 'girl', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Denise', 'Sophie', 'exchange', 'roles', 'Then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'suited', 'other.The', 'opening', 'sequence', 'involving', 'boat', 'chase', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'introduction', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'Skiing', 'sequences', 'go', 'Bond', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'OK', 'fave', 'still', 'where', 'film', 'title-', 'ON', 'HER', 'MAJESTY', 'SECRET', 'SERVICE.I', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Coltrane', 'back-', 'loved', 'leg', 'joke', 'did', 'Bond', 'later', 'Carlyle', 'turned', 'out', 'good', 'performance', 'too', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'pawn', 'Elektra.The', 'BMW', 'seemed', 'be', 'there', 'just', 'show', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'used', 'once', 'gadgets', 'face', 'what', 'want', 'see.As', 'DVD', 'extras', 'liked', 'explanations', 'stunts', 'similar', 'quot', 'Follow', 'white', 'rabbit', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'DVD', 'Making', 'TWINE', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'longer', 'IMHO', 'other', 'Makings', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'made', 'Anything', 'Shirley', 'Manson', 'garbage', 'always', 'welcome', 'Two', 'things-', 'One', 'English', 'subtitles', 'same', 'majority', 'James', 'Bond', 'Gift', 'Set', '2', 'when', 'have', 'commentary', 'option', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'subtitles', 'only', 'way', 'Secondly-', 'Bond', 'DVDs', 'are', 'bios', 'main', 'characters', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'addition.All', 'great', 'film', 'shall', 'miss']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Connery does not help - setting the standard so  high with the earlier Bond flicks. Bronson will always deliver as bond. His  supporting cast- Marceau and Carlyle are equally good. The actress who  plays Christmas Jones is laughable. She is so wrong for the part, you wish  she had stayed home. The plot - not bad- classic Bond, with the fate of the  world at stake. I liked it becasue there is always room for a good action  film, with no indecent language and (dare I say) excessive violence. Bond  delivers.

477818,A3CQCZRTVQZGDN,6305784906,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I was hooked on this movie from the beginning; the opening sequence is one of the most thrilling and amazing ever done in a Bond movie and instantly sold me on the entire thing. I'll first describe the things they did wrong  for this one: Denise Richards and underexploitation of the villain. I'm  sorry, but Denise Richards is no nuclear physicist, and shame on the  casting directors for trying to pawn her off on us. She's hot, I'll give  her that. But her lines were delivered atrociously and from the minute she  walks up in her short shorts and tight shirt, you can't take the character  seriously. Of course, this is a Bond film, so you can ignore seriousness  when it comes to Bond girls if you want without it spoiling the movie. My  second problem with TWINE was how they implemented the main villain,  Renard. Now this was a villain I was interested in; he was ruthless,  unfeeling, and yet had a strange pathos about him. And the movie makers did  not use him to his full extent. I don't want to spoil too much of the  movie, but they could have done a lot more with a man who feels no pain.  Those two quibbles aside, TWINE is easily Pierce Brosnan's best effort so  far, especially after the dismal Tomorrow Never Dies. He combined his  effortless grace and charm with a certain ruthlessness that I loved about  Timothy Dalton's Bond (yes, I am a Timothy Dalton fan, don't crucify me),  and which was one of the most defining features of Connery's Bond in  Goldfinger, widely regarded as the best Bond film. There was an actual  story this time around, unlike TND. And Sophie Marceau sizzles...she's  amazing as Elektra King.

Pierce Brosnan (&quot;Grey Owl&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, &quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot;) reprises his role as Bond, James Bond for the third time and he is better then ever. In the 19th bond film, the cast is back and also gets better than ever. The story starts off with Bond rescuing a suitcase of money and then finds out that he is in the chase of his life trying to avenge a friend's death and stop a man from a nuclear war! 'M' (Dame Judi Dench, &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot;, &quot;Chocolat&quot;) informs Bond of what he's dealing with and wants to know the details of how her friend, Mr. Robert King died. Mr. King owns an oil company and his daughter, Elektra King (Sophie Marceau, &quot;Lost and Found&quot;) inherits it. Bond now must protect her from death also. Renard (Robert Carlyle, &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, &quot;The Beach&quot;) is the villain who can't feel pain or pleasure because of a bullet in his brain. Because of this condition, he is basically unstoppable and a worthy adversary for 007. When Bond's adventure continues, he meets the lovely Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards, &quot;Tail Lights Fade&quot;, &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;, &quot;Valentine&quot;), a nuclear physicist. Renard gets hold of a nuclear warhead and plans for the worst. This is the best Bond yet with great effects, a wonderful cast, a more than great director (Michael Apted &quot;Gorillas In The Mist&quot;), and a very well-written script. Also, there are several plot twists in which you'll be hanging on to your seat, Robbie Coltrane reprises his role as Valentine Zukovsky. John Cleese (&quot;Monty Python&quot;, &quot;Rat Race&quot;) is added to the cast as 'R', 'Q's (Desmond Llewellyn, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;) replacement.

While Connery played the character with much suave and finesse, Brosnan plays it with a more serious and bolder touch. Without getting into too much detail about story or plot for this latest Bond flick it definitley lives up to its title with evil characters that don't know too much of a good thing can be hazardous to their health ! The story or plot is packed with typical Bond-esque twists and turns dealing with explosions,espionage, gadgets and global domination in some form or another concerning the world's leading oil pipelines along with Soviet politics ! In true essence it's any James Bond fan's cinematic treat.The beautiful and gorgeous French actress Sophie Marceau (from Braveheart fame) is perfect for her role as heiress Elektra King to an oil empire. Even with half her character's ear missing (watch the movie and you'll know why)she's still mesmerizing. The only questionable choice for another character is Denise Richards (Wildthings) for her role as nuclear physicist/scientist Christmas Jones. At times her wooden performance will make some viewers cringe.I know, give Denise Richards time and she will be a &quot;better&quot; actress someday.It's just that she seems great for eye candy and nothing else (it's embarrassing since she plays an American scientist among European and British characters/actors). The only other disappointing note is the final cinematic appearnce of British actor Llewellyn as Q ;he passed away shortly after filming this project. The dvd inclusion of Garbage's video and theme title for the film,while the video has it's own Bond storyline, keeps in sync with the  overall effect or subject of world domination and destruction. It's amazing no matter what artist from almost any pop genre is chosen to record the Bond opening themes, they always come out on top ! It's a pleasant surprise to see the group garbage in an almost &quot;formal&quot; music video environment without going to wild, extreme, or bizarre (not that that is such a bad thing for the group's own personal musical image---I'm a fan of theirs,also)...To say this is the worst James Bond---NEVER !

477831,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6305784906,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[3, 5]","I don't really know what it is about this particular Bond movie, but it comes up a bit short. This is by no means because of anyone involved, because it is a very well done film that looks great. It starts off with the usually great opening sequence before the credits, which also includes Bond getting pretty hurt for the first time, but it then goes from mearly good to just simply okay. Pierce Brosnan returns for his third go around as Bond and he is as assured and confident in the role as ever. The most confident one has been in the role since the good old days of Sean Connery. Let's start off with the plot. Bond is assigned to protect an oil heiress named Elektra King(played by the sensual and beautiful Sophie Marceau), after her oil tycoon father is murdered in the opening teaser. Elektra was once kidnapped by a terrorist named Renard(Robert Carlyle). What Bond eventually finds out, albeit being too late, is that Elektra has fallen in love with Renard during that time and the two of them are now in cohorts with each other. The main villainous plot has Elektra intending to destroy Istanbul by exploding a submarine , which would then force the world to rely on her own pipeline. Along the way, James teams up with a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jones(Denise Richards). 007's boss M(the always great Judi Dench), is caught up in it and is also kidnapped by Renard. Bond villains have always been a great part of the franchise. Carlyle's Renard is seen so little, and given nothing to do, and he feels like he's just there to stand and look sinister. Elektra is a far more interesting and watchable character. Bond also meets up with Valentin Zukovsky(Robbie Coltrane), previously seen in ""Goldeneye"". The action is good, but it's been tamed way down from the previous film, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". It's apparent that the filmmakers wanted to tame the action and make it a little more plot driven like older Bond films. What this one needed IS a bit more action. It's a talky film which drags on and on. It's also sad to know that this was the final appearance of our beloved Q, played by Desmond Llewelyn. He died in a car wreck not long after. In his scenes with John Cleese, it is obvious that Q was being prepped to leave anyway. At least Cleese is a brilliant new addition. The Denise Richards part is laughable. While she is beautiful and nice to look at, her acting is something to be desired, and the mere thought of her as a nuclear physicist is a joke. Who's going to buy that?. Brosnan is Bond. He seemed comfortable with the role from the beginning, and now he just seems to be Bond. It makes you think - Roger and Timothy who?. Like any other Bond film, the movie is filled with gadgets galore, and great locations. The film is as entertaining as you would expect a 007 picture to be, but there's just something there that just doesn't hit the mark. The latest film, ""Die Another Day"", is a lot better and more entertaining.",3,This 'World' Is Not Quite Enough,1043884800,"01 30, 2003",2003,2958,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'particular', 'Bond', 'movie', 'up', 'bit', 'short', 'means', 'anyone', 'involved', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'great', 'usually', 'great', 'opening', 'sequence', 'credits', 'also', 'Bond', 'getting', 'pretty', 'hurt', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'mearly', 'good', 'just', 'simply', 'okay', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'returns', 'third', 'go', 'around', 'Bond', 'as', 'assured', 'confident', 'role', 'ever', 'most', 'confident', 'one', 'been', 'role', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Let', 'start', 'off', 'plot', 'Bond', 'assigned', 'protect', 'oil', 'heiress', 'named', 'Elektra', 'King', 'played', 'sensual', 'beautiful', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'father', 'murdered', 'opening', 'teaser', 'Elektra', 'was', 'once', 'kidnapped', 'terrorist', 'named', 'Renard', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'What', 'Bond', 'eventually', 'out', 'being', 'too', 'late', 'Elektra', 'fallen', 'love', 'Renard', 'time', 'two', 'are', 'now', 'cohorts', 'other', 'main', 'villainous', 'plot', 'Elektra', 'intending', 'destroy', 'Istanbul', 'exploding', 'submarine', 'would', 'then', 'force', 'world', 'rely', 'own', 'pipeline', 'way', 'James', 'up', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'named', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'Denise', 'Richards', '007', 'boss', 'M', 'always', 'great', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'caught', 'up', 'also', 'kidnapped', 'Renard', 'Bond', 'villains', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'part', 'franchise', 'Carlyle', 'Renard', 'seen', 'so', 'little', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'just', 'there', 'stand', 'look', 'sinister', 'Elektra', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'watchable', 'character', 'Bond', 'also', 'up', 'Valentin', 'Zukovsky', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'previously', 'seen', 'Goldeneye', 'action', 'good', 'been', 'tamed', 'way', 'previous', 'film', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'apparent', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'tame', 'action', 'make', 'little', 'more', 'plot', 'driven', 'older', 'Bond', 'films', 'What', 'one', 'needed', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'talky', 'film', 'also', 'sad', 'know', 'was', 'final', 'appearance', 'beloved', 'Q', 'played', 'Desmond', 'Llewelyn', 'died', 'car', 'wreck', 'not', 'long', 'scenes', 'John', 'Cleese', 'obvious', 'Q', 'was', 'being', 'prepped', 'leave', 'anyway', 'least', 'Cleese', 'brilliant', 'new', 'addition', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'part', 'laughable', 'beautiful', 'nice', 'look', 'acting', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'mere', 'thought', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'joke', 'Who', 'going', 'buy', 'Brosnan', 'Bond', 'seemed', 'comfortable', 'role', 'beginning', 'now', 'just', 'be', 'Bond', 'think', 'Roger', 'Timothy', 'who', 'other', 'Bond', 'film', 'movie', 'filled', 'gadgets', 'galore', 'great', 'locations', 'film', 'as', 'entertaining', 'would', 'expect', '007', 'picture', 'be', 'just', 'something', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'hit', 'mark', 'latest', 'film', 'Die', 'Day', 'lot', 'better', 'more', 'entertaining']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Fortunately there is also less product placement in  this picture than in the last one in which this was pushed to an  intolerable degree. Another strength of the picture is its villain, one of  the best in the series. What disappointed me was the lack of tension and  the rather unexciting action scenes which were, for the most part, worse  than in the last films. After the incredible pre-credit-sequence, the  quality of the action goes steadily downward. The lame showdown is slightly  better than the one in &quot;Tommorow never dies&quot;, still you have to  say that all Brosnan Bonds ended with the worst action scene of the entire  movie, a big mistake since you should end the film with the BEST you have  to offer.All in all, &quot;The World is not enough&quot; is a step in  the right direction in terms of storyline and characterization. Now they  should hire a director who is a wizard in action sequences (maybe John Woo  should become a Briton). It is also the film that will always be remembered  as the one with last appearance of &quot;Q&quot;. Its place in the  Bond-history-books is therefore secured.",3,There is still room for improvement,957916800,"05 10, 2000",2000,1721,"['quot', 'World', 'not', 'enough', 'quot', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', 'worthy', 'entry', 'never', 'ending', 'James-Bond-franchise', 'have', 'weakness', 'Bond', 'movies', 'hoped', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'two', 'Brosnan-starrers', 'were', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'best', 'films', 'franchise', 'respects', 'quot', 'World', 'not', 'enough', 'quot', 'better', 'two', 'predecessors', 'others', 'worse.Let', 'start', 'good', 'news', 'think', 'film', 'more', 'class', 'last', 'Bond', 'film', 'less', 'joyless', 'Brosnan', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'edge', 'Fortunately', 'also', 'less', 'product', 'placement', 'picture', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'pushed', 'intolerable', 'degree', 'strength', 'picture', 'villain', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'What', 'disappointed', 'was', 'lack', 'tension', 'rather', 'unexciting', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'worse', 'last', 'films', 'incredible', 'pre-credit-sequence', 'quality', 'action', 'steadily', 'downward', 'lame', 'showdown', 'slightly', 'better', 'one', 'quot', 'Tommorow', 'never', 'quot', 'still', 'have', 'say', 'Brosnan', 'Bonds', 'ended', 'worst', 'action', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'big', 'mistake', 'should', 'end', 'film', 'BEST', 'have', 'offer.All', 'quot', 'World', 'not', 'enough', 'quot', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'terms', 'storyline', 'characterization', 'Now', 'should', 'hire', 'director', 'who', 'wizard', 'action', 'sequences', 'maybe', 'John', 'Woo', 'should', 'become', 'Briton', 'also', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'last', 'appearance', 'quot', 'Q', 'quot', 'place', 'Bond-history-books', 'therefore', 'secured']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

The spectacular beginning action sequence is a knockout and a perfect way to blast off this impressive Bond entry. The film advances at a steady pace  and is filled with tongue-in-cheek humor. The ravishing Sophie Marceau is a  memorable Bond Girl and is certainly the best in the Brosnan Bonds, she's  everything a man could ask for; beautiful, exotic and seductive but lethal.  The voluptuously beautiful Denise Richards is also great, more Americanized  than Marceau but also impressive. Even though she doesn't have the looks  for a Dr. specialist in nuclear physics but she is attractive and that's  the most important thing for a Bond Girl even though it couldn't hurt for  them to have personality and smarts. John Cleese of 'Monty Python' fame  appears as 'R' who replaces the late Desmond Llewelyn who appeared as 'Q'  in 19 Bond films. There's a skiing action sequence that could remotely  compare to the one in 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. Robert Carlyle who played it  nice in 'The Full Monty' maked for a lethal villain here even though the  excellent premise of a man who could not feel pain is not fully  appreciated. The last action sequence is a bit of a letdown and the way the  villain dies is wholly unoriginal and disappointing. But still exciting  action sequences, a healthy dose of wit, 2 memorable Bond Girls and a  lethal villain make this one of the most impressive of the latest Bond  entries.

Bond is back in this latest of the genre's thrillers and Pierce Brosnan as the unflappable 007 is at his best!In ""The World Is not Enough,"" it's action, more action,  and even more action!  This Bondian entry moves fast and furious, almost as  if the director (Michael Apted) was afraid that if he slowed down, the  audience would depart!Not so, this viewer!  Brosnan seems to have  the kinks worked out and appears more relaxed (and better coifed!)--perhaps  he feels now that Connery  and Moore are not lurking over his shoulders!  He doesn't have to worry about unnatural comparisons!And where  would any Bond film be without exotic (and erotic!) locations.

It is going to take all the talent that 007 possesses if he is to emerge  the winner of this tryst!Of course, we are honored with the  presence of Judi Dench (who seems to have found a permanent role as the new  M) and roly-poly Robbie Coltrane chimes in with a good performance.  Naturally, a Bond film cannot be without its ritual ""femme fatale""--and  this lady's fatal, rest assured (mourning does not become Elektra here).

477845,A2N9OENVXDF643,6305784906,Brian M. Benway,"[3, 3]","In the wake of the excellent Special Edition treatments that previous Bond  movies have enjoyed, this &quot;Ultimate Special Edition&quot; DVD of TWINE  is somewhat of a let-down in comparison.  Don't get me wrong, TWINE is a  very good Bond movie, with an interesting--albeit labrynthine--plot, great  stunt sequences, beautiful Bond women, and excellent character development.  Brosnan continues to give us a Bond that is an amalgamation of all of the  best characteristics of his predecessors, with a bit of his own, suave  style thrown in for good measure.  He keeps getting better with every film,  and dare I say, one day, he may supplant Connery as the consummate Bond.  The transfer of this film to DVD is pristine, continuing in MGM's tradition  of providing excellent DVD transfers.  But, as mentioned earlier, this disc  is relatively feature-poor.  While the other Special Edition Bond films  included multiple trailers, numerous TV spots, a couple of 45-minute  documentaries, and photo galleries, the TWINE DVD merely scrapes by with  only one trailer, a short, 15-minute documentary, and a series of alternate  video tracks (which are quite interesting).  That's it: no TV spots, no  longer documentaries, no photos.

Plummeting to a new  entertainment low, The World is Not Enough is pitiful shadow of the Bond  series former glorioius self. The suave all-knowing secret agent, the  tounge-in-cheek humor, scantly clad women, charismatic antagionists,  amazing gadgets, and hard-broiled suspense that dignified the Bond series  apart from the action pack in the 1960's has sadly been rehashed,  repackaged, and constantly reused to the point of cinematic oblivion.  Despite the obvious debonair charm of the ever-so-talented Pierce Bronson  in the role he was made for, this new Bond adventure is noticably absent of  the intelligence, sophistication, and film-making excellance that elevated  the orginal Bond films to such unparalled fame and prestige in the 1960's.  The film attempts to add mind-numbing and old-fashioned sentiment to an  old-fashioned cocktail creating a very dry dry dry martina of out-dated  cinema. Gone is the thrill of wondering what magnificent death trap will  Bond get himself out of this time, gone is fun of watching each  successively unbelievable stunt, gone are the insanely demented Goldfingers  or Earnest Blowfields, and gone are all the many numerous pleasures of  watching a James Bond film.

The latest chapter in the Bond series has all the believability of a daytime  drama. Pierce Brosnan gives his usual great performance of the tough yet  sophisticated 007, and the choice of Sophie Marceau as his initial love  interest is a good one. The writing however leaves a great deal to be  desired. The plot line is so very thin, that even the most casual Bond fan  can figure out what is going to happen within 30 minutes of the films  opening credits, which leaves you the rest of the movie to do nothing but  enjoy the special effects. The addition of Denise Richards to the movie  seems to be almost an after thought, and could have just as easily been a  man, however 007 would not have any one to sleep with at the end of the  movie.

They're action movies pure and simple and arguably no one does it better. But seeing as how we're already on Bond 19 and while it's not that the series has completely run out of ideas, there is a sameness and familiarity to it all that prevents it from being the best Bond it can be. Doesn't mean that the filmmakers don't try really hard though.After the killing of oil tycoon Robert King, 007 James Bond is hired to protect his daughter, beautiful Elektra. The main villain orchestrating everything is Renard, a man who was shot in the head and affecting his brain so that he can't actually feel pain, although the bullet will eventually kill him. Bond has to team with nuclear physicist Christmas Jones (Bond girls have had pretty strange names but this is just stupid) in order to avert a world-threatening plan (natch).First, the casting: Sophie Marceau personally is my choice for the hottest Bond girl but acting-wise it's very extreme from one end to the next without any in-betweens. And Denise Richards is arguably the biggest miscast I've seen in a film. As for Pierce Brosnan, well this is #3 for him so he's still as suave and Bond-esque with the action hero coming into play whenever he needs to. As for the villain, Robert Carlyle is one of those Bond baddies where the premise is there but he's just not as compelling, in fact he seems kind of wimpy.The Bond series lately has been going for that bigger is badder approach but there's a couple of goodies: the opening with a big boat chase is one of my favorite openers in the series but then we have a kind of meh ski escape as well as Bond versus a helicopter with sawblades attached which is as exciting as it is preposterous. But that's what's expected with any Bond film so I don't even mind anymore but there's almost a too over-the-topness to it as if the films tried to eclipse Bond wannabe films of late.Is it the best Bond?

It *did* have the potential to be a great addition to the series, but ended up being far too long and greatly lacking any good characterization.My biggest problem with *World* is the villain--Renard. The beginning of the film sets him up to be an enormous challenge for Bond--a man who feels no pain, who can push himself stronger and harder than any ordinary man. However, there is absolutely no sign of this later in the film. Aside from two early scenes that display his imperviousness to pain, he might as well *be* an ordinary man.Another serious problem I have is with the characterization of *all* the women in the movie. As pointed out by several other reviewers, Denise Richards is--at best--comical as Dr. Christmas Jones, the shorts-clad nuclear scientist who ends up as Bond's main crush. On the other hand, Sophie Marceau is ridiculously dramatic as villainess Electra King who pouts childishly throughout the entire film, despite everyone's insistence of her strength in overcoming her &quot;kidnapping.&quot; I regret to say that even though I adore Judi Dench and Samantha Bond as &quot;M&quot; and Moneypenny, respectively, I have an incredibly hard time accepting that the former *would* walk into a trap like the one set for her. Similarly, I believe that Moneypenny has tradionally shown herself to be above the petty jealousy she seems to display toward Dr. Molly Warmflash (what a ridiculous name!) early in the movie.Finally, (and this would likely take care of the film's seemingly endless length) there seem to be a lot of unnecessary sweeping views of vast Eastern European landscapes, which could be shortened or done without entirely.All this said, I *do* think that there are some wonderful fight and chase scenes in the movie (and superb music to go along with them)--namely the awesome boat chase at the beginning, the parahawk chase through the French Alps and the fight scene at the banker's office in the opening sequence. The attack at Zukovsky's factory was also quite entertaining, despite the fact that Bond's awesome BMW was destroyed almost before he could use it!I *do* wish that these few positive notes could erase all the bad factors in the film, as, like I said earlier, I believe it had real promise to develop some highly complex characters.

That explains pretty much the whole movie - you know you're getting girls, gimmicks, and lots of explosions and stunts.  This one seems to to better than the average Bond.  Brosnan has brought a  greater degree of ferocity to the part, more like Sean Connery.  The best  part for me is that it looks good - unlike most action movies today, there  is very little computer animation (one computer animated part looks  terribly phoney (the flying sawblades) by contrast with all the real stunts  and explosions).  I also liked the interaction between Bond and the  pseudo-badguys, meaning the criminals in the movie who aren't the main bad  guys that Bond uses to help him out, another proud tradition from the early  Bonds.The plot is a little murky (sort of like Cruise's Mission:  Impossible), but it doesn't really detract from the movie.  If you like  Bond, you should like this film.As for the DVD edition itself, there are  a ton of extras: (1) the director's commentary is quite good, if a little  dry; some neat insight into what he was doing with each scene and why (2)  the 2nd commentary (prod. designer, 2nd unit director, and composer) wasn't  as good - seemed like they didn't really prepare anything, just sat around  and yacked, thus it is not very useful; additionally the composer talked  about the music in particular scenes, but with the movie soundtrack  completely removed, you couldn't remember the music he was talking about,  so not very useful.  (3) the &quot;secrets of Bond&quot; clips you could  cut to in the middle of the movie would have been more interesting if there  was a little commentary about how things were done, rather than a big  visual montage with pounding music. (4) The making of segment was only okay  - the interviewer was a ditz.All in all, with the extras and the  enjoyment of the film, this is a very good DVD.",4,"A definitive Bond movie, better than average",961977600,"06 26, 2000",2000,1890,"['James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'movie', 'know', ""'re"", 'getting', 'girls', 'gimmicks', 'lots', 'explosions', 'stunts', 'one', 'better', 'average', 'Bond', 'Brosnan', 'brought', 'greater', 'degree', 'ferocity', 'part', 'more', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'best', 'part', 'good', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'today', 'very', 'little', 'computer', 'animation', 'one', 'computer', 'animated', 'part', 'terribly', 'phoney', 'flying', 'sawblades', 'contrast', 'real', 'stunts', 'explosions', 'also', 'liked', 'interaction', 'Bond', 'pseudo-badguys', 'meaning', 'criminals', 'movie', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'main', 'bad', 'guys', 'Bond', 'help', 'out', 'proud', 'tradition', 'early', 'Bonds.The', 'plot', 'little', 'murky', 'sort', 'Cruise', 'Mission', 'Impossible', ""n't"", 'really', 'detract', 'movie', 'like', 'Bond', 'should', 'like', 'film.As', 'DVD', 'edition', 'are', 'ton', 'extras', '1', 'director', 'commentary', 'quite', 'good', 'little', 'dry', 'neat', 'insight', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'scene', 'why', '2', '2nd', 'commentary', 'prod', 'designer', '2nd', 'unit', 'director', 'composer', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'prepare', 'anything', 'just', 'sat', 'yacked', 'thus', 'not', 'very', 'useful', 'additionally', 'composer', 'talked', 'music', 'particular', 'scenes', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'completely', 'removed', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'music', 'was', 'talking', 'about', 'not', 'very', 'useful', '3', 'quot', 'secrets', 'Bond', 'quot', 'clips', 'could', 'cut', 'middle', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'little', 'commentary', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'rather', 'big', 'visual', 'montage', 'pounding', 'music', '4', 'making', 'segment', 'was', 'only', 'okay', 'interviewer', 'was', 'ditz.All', 'extras', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'DVD']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

I almost walked out in disgust then too...I promised a friend of mine (who will remain nameless) that I would try and sit through it a couple of months back but I failed...I simply don't like it. Really, after the boat chase it slips into melodrama and never recovers. It is the most boring non-fun movie of the franchise.- It was boring and they turned James Bond into a Nancy-boy.- The action setpieces seemed artificial and forced - they lacked the flow evident in earlier movies. The parahawk sequence is a prime example of what was wrong with TWINE's action, it was stilted and lackluster (not helped by a terrible Arnold score). The only action sequence that worked on any level was the boat chase.- Denise Richards as Christmas Jones was the Stacey Sutton of the Brosnan era (but without the knock-out looks, sorry Finesse).- Pierce Brosnan seemed to sleepwalk his way through the part delivering his worst performance as James Bond (his best still being his excellent turn as 007 in GE).- A lackluster screenplay with more twists and turns than a pretzel, none of which were interesting or particularly well explained.- The worst finale of any Bond movie....who really cared.- ""I thought Christmas only came once a year"" -- the whole theater groaned, no one laughed or even chuckled.- Elektra as a villain was telegraphed way too early.- They used another flipping gadget car. Prior to Brosnan we had gadget cars in 1964, 1965, 1977 and 1987. They used to be special now they are commonplace marketing which ever newest vehicle of the company that dished out the most dough.- David Arnold used the James Bond theme too much, the only track that he scored a home run on was during the boat chase.",5,This movie should have been killed at birth!,962928000,"07 7, 2000",2000,2365,"['thoughts', 'abomination', 'movie', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'were', 'recently', 'reinforced', '-I', 'saw', 'terrible', 'Casino', 'Royale', '1967', 'again', 'past', 'weekend', '.You', 'know', 'managed', 'sit', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'manage', 'do', 'TWINE', 'IMO', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'worse', 'unfunny', 'spoof', 'Casino', 'Royale', '.It', 'not', 'only', 'worst', 'Bond', 'movie', 'ever', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'action', 'use', 'term', 'loosely', 'hardly', 'travesty', 'movies', 'last', '30', 'years.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'sit', 'TWINE', 'saw', 'first', 'night', 'was', 'out', 'movie', 'theater', 'almost', 'walked', 'out', 'disgust', 'then', 'too', 'promised', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'will', 'remain', 'nameless', 'would', 'try', 'sit', 'couple', 'months', 'back', 'failed', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Really', 'boat', 'chase', 'melodrama', 'never', 'recovers', 'most', 'boring', 'non-fun', 'movie', 'franchise.-', 'was', 'boring', 'turned', 'James', 'Bond', 'Nancy-boy.-', 'action', 'setpieces', 'seemed', 'artificial', 'forced', 'lacked', 'flow', 'evident', 'earlier', 'movies', 'parahawk', 'sequence', 'prime', 'example', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'TWINE', 'action', 'was', 'stilted', 'lackluster', 'not', 'helped', 'terrible', 'Arnold', 'score', 'only', 'action', 'sequence', 'worked', 'level', 'was', 'boat', 'chase.-', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'was', 'Stacey', 'Sutton', 'Brosnan', 'era', 'knock-out', 'sorry', 'Finesse', '.-', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'seemed', 'sleepwalk', 'way', 'part', 'delivering', 'worst', 'performance', 'James', 'Bond', 'best', 'still', 'being', 'excellent', 'turn', '007', 'GE', '.-', 'lackluster', 'screenplay', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'pretzel', 'none', 'were', 'interesting', 'particularly', 'well', 'explained.-', 'worst', 'finale', 'Bond', 'movie', 'really', 'cared.-', 'thought', 'Christmas', 'only', 'came', 'once', 'year', 'whole', 'theater', 'groaned', 'one', 'laughed', 'even', 'chuckled.-', 'Elektra', 'villain', 'was', 'telegraphed', 'way', 'too', 'early.-', 'used', 'flipping', 'gadget', 'car', 'Prior', 'Brosnan', 'had', 'gadget', 'cars', '1964', '1965', '1977', '1987', 'used', 'be', 'special', 'now', 'are', 'commonplace', 'marketing', 'ever', 'newest', 'vehicle', 'company', 'dished', 'out', 'most', 'dough.-', 'David', 'Arnold', 'used', 'James', 'Bond', 'theme', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'track', 'scored', 'home', 'run', 'was', 'boat', 'chase']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Pierce Brosnan, no matter what cranky critics say, is a fantastic Bond, who is sort of like a melting pot of the past actor's  best attributes. Connery's vicious edge, Moore's amusing wit, and Dalton's  brutality. Another thing that makes Brosnan a keeper is that, like Connery  and Moore, he has fun with Bond. Dalton and Lazenby made the mistake of  taking this as a serious acting job. It isn't. TWINE does have a great  script which is understandable (I guess a lot of people who complained just  weren't attentive, since very few modern movies require that.) Renard may  have been a lame bad guy, but Carlisle did play him well and believably -  isn't that all that counts? Denise Richards, however laughable she was as  Christmas Jones, did well with her material. And, the way I look at it, she  wasn't evne the main Bond woman this time around. Sophie Marceau is perhaps  one of the sexiest Bond women ever to grace the silver screen.

According to director Michael Apted, Brosnan went into this film with the desire to look further inside the character of 007.  Scriptwriters Purvis and Wade delivered and the result is one of the finest films in the 40 year old series.Brosnan seizes the character of Bond and makes it his own in this picture.  No longer a comical superhero, this Bond gets injured, feels pain, and becomes emotionally involved in the mission.  His feelings betray him and he is left to salvage the situation to the best of his abilities.  &quot;This time it's personal&quot; has become a Hollywood cliche but it really is true for Bond this time around.  Not only is the central character given more depth and complexity, but many of the supporting roles are well written and superbly acted.  Special mention must be made of Sophie Marceau's performance as Elektra and Robert Carlyle as Renard, a villain who shows real pathos but never truly elicits the audience's full sympathy due to his horrific crimes.Of course, being a Bond film, it also has plenty of humor and outrageous action-oriented set pieces.

After saving Elektra's life-and becoming romantically involved with her as well-Bond's subsequent investigation leads him to suspect she may not be as innocent as she appears.After surviving a series of standard hair-raising action set-pieces, including an air-born buzzsaw attack that is both exciting and ridiculous(and typically over-long), Bond finds his mission even more complicated when M (Judi Dench) stupidily gets herself kidnapped.  This is the  most unacceptable portion of the film.  M, whom should be wiser than all the Double O's put together, should never had fallen for such an obvoius ploy.With the aid of a sexy, busty nuclear physicist played by Denise Richards (the less said about her performance the better)007 goes forward and eventually saves the day.The weakest film in the Brosnan era to date, nevertheless has many strong points to offer.  Brosnan is good and Robert Carlyle does well with his underwritten part as the villain who feels no pain because of a bullet lodged in his brain.  Most Bond adversaries would gleefully relish this but Renard spends much of the film moping about how he can't feel love.  Also good is Sophia Marceau the central figure of the movie, who's not quite what she seems.  Robbie Coltrane makes a welcomed return although his character has nothing really to do.  John Cleese joins the series as the new Q, replacing the much beloved Desmond Llewelyn, who sadly died shortly after this film was released.",2,"Actually, it's quite enough!",1039824000,"12 14, 2002",2002,1708,"['Messily', 'directed', 'over-produced', 'over-long', '007', 'flick', 'Bond', 'protecting', 'beautiful', 'Elektra', 'King', 'daughter', 'petroleun', 'magnate', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'villainous', 'Renard', 'terrorist', 'planning', 'massive', 'destruction', 'oil', 'pipeline', 'saving', 'Elektra', 'life-and', 'becoming', 'romantically', 'involved', 'well-Bond', 'subsequent', 'investigation', 'suspect', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'innocent', 'surviving', 'series', 'standard', 'hair-raising', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'including', 'air-born', 'buzzsaw', 'attack', 'exciting', 'ridiculous', 'typically', 'over-long', 'Bond', 'mission', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'stupidily', 'kidnapped', 'most', 'unacceptable', 'portion', 'film', 'M', 'whom', 'should', 'be', 'wiser', 'Double', 'O', 'put', 'together', 'should', 'never', 'had', 'fallen', 'such', 'obvoius', 'aid', 'sexy', 'busty', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'played', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'less', 'said', 'performance', 'better', '007', 'forward', 'eventually', 'day.The', 'weakest', 'film', 'Brosnan', 'era', 'date', 'nevertheless', 'many', 'strong', 'points', 'offer', 'Brosnan', 'good', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'well', 'underwritten', 'part', 'villain', 'who', 'pain', 'bullet', 'lodged', 'brain', 'Most', 'Bond', 'adversaries', 'would', 'gleefully', 'relish', 'Renard', 'much', 'film', 'moping', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'love', 'Also', 'good', 'Sophia', 'Marceau', 'central', 'figure', 'movie', 'who', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'welcomed', 'return', 'character', 'nothing', 'really', 'do', 'John', 'Cleese', 'series', 'new', 'Q', 'replacing', 'much', 'beloved', 'Desmond', 'Llewelyn', 'who', 'sadly', 'died', 'shortly', 'film', 'was', 'released']",The World Is Not Enough VHS
477871,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6305784906,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 5]","I enjoyed this movie but a few things bothered me.  I think Denise Richards is a beautiful woman but she's not convincing enough as a top nuclear scientist.  Sophie Marceau is sexy and does a good job.  I don't  know too much about Robert Carlyle but he did well as a villain.  Seeing  Judi Dench as M was very cool but it's not so much the fault with the  acting it's the plot.It's good but it didn't have the &quot;OOMF&quot;  that I usually get from previous Bond films.  Oh, the action and effects  were top notch and you can see so in the secrets segment of the DVD but the  goal for the producers was to see a new side of Bond.  Thus they selected  Michael Apted to direct the film.  His previous movies were not action.  They were good movies such as &quot;Coal Miner's Daughter&quot;,  &quot;Gorillas in the Midst&quot; and &quot;Nell&quot;.  Three very cool  movies but non-action.  It was a bold move.  I guess we are treated with a  side of James Bond that we are not used to seeing.  A Bond that shows his  rage.  Is something new, something good?  Either way, I enjoyed the movie  and it's very good and different from the others.  Maybe another woman as a  nuclear scientist and not a young 20+ year old?  I guess I'm used to seeing  older women as Bond's ladies and not someone so young but it's OK.  Denise  Richards is very beautiful and she's a talented actress.First, let's  discuss the audio and video.  The audio is great and at first I questioned  about the surround in the early beginning but then I started to hear the  surround later on.  I was expecting a lot more through the boat scenes in  terms of audio but throughout the movie, the sound becomes prominent.  The  audio is well done throughout the film and is a good highlight for this  DVD.  The video is pretty good and MGM did a great job.  I don't think I  recall seeing any artifacts and no horrendous switch to the new layer.  It's anamorphic, so be happy!As for the DVD, The menu is done really  well, interactive, computer generated and very nice.  Similar to the  MATRIX DVD where you can see how they created some scenes in the movie,  this DVD allows you to see &quot;The Secrets of 007&quot; where if you see  the 007, with a press on your remote, you can access the making of certain  scenes and see the storyboards which is nice.  The GARBAGE music video for  &quot;The World is not Enough&quot; is pretty cool.  I always felt she is a  freaky woman, I like their music but she's freaky.  The video is very cool  and they must of spent a lot of money on it.  For commentary freaks, you  get two.  One from the director and the other from the production designer,  unit director and composer.  Also, the booklet included is pretty cool but  booklets would be nice if they included it on the DVD as well.Welcome  to a new Bond and a chance to share the psyche of the agent known as 007.  A very good DVD but a new side of Bond that I was not easily open to but it  was a pretty damn good movie.",4,The World is Not Enough - Was the storyline enough?,960336000,"06 7, 2000",2000,2987,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'few', 'things', 'bothered', 'think', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'not', 'convincing', 'enough', 'top', 'nuclear', 'scientist', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'sexy', 'good', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'did', 'well', 'villain', 'Seeing', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'M', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fault', 'acting', 'plot.It', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'quot', 'OOMF', 'quot', 'usually', 'get', 'previous', 'Bond', 'films', 'Oh', 'action', 'effects', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'can', 'see', 'so', 'secrets', 'segment', 'DVD', 'goal', 'producers', 'was', 'see', 'new', 'side', 'Bond', 'Thus', 'selected', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'direct', 'film', 'previous', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'action', 'were', 'good', 'movies', 'such', 'quot', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gorillas', 'Midst', 'quot', 'quot', 'Nell', 'quot', 'Three', 'very', 'cool', 'movies', 'non-action', 'was', 'bold', 'move', 'guess', 'are', 'treated', 'side', 'James', 'Bond', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'seeing', 'Bond', 'rage', 'something', 'new', 'something', 'good', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'different', 'others', 'Maybe', 'woman', 'nuclear', 'scientist', 'not', 'young', '20+', 'year', 'old', 'guess', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing', 'older', 'women', 'Bond', 'ladies', 'not', 'someone', 'so', 'young', 'OK.', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'very', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'actress.First', 'let', 'discuss', 'audio', 'video', 'audio', 'great', 'first', 'questioned', 'surround', 'early', 'beginning', 'then', 'started', 'hear', 'surround', 'later', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'boat', 'scenes', 'terms', 'audio', 'movie', 'sound', 'prominent', 'audio', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'good', 'highlight', 'DVD', 'video', 'pretty', 'good', 'MGM', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'recall', 'seeing', 'artifacts', 'horrendous', 'switch', 'new', 'layer', 'anamorphic', 'so', 'be', 'happy', 'DVD', 'menu', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'interactive', 'computer', 'generated', 'very', 'nice', 'Similar', 'MATRIX', 'DVD', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'created', 'scenes', 'movie', 'DVD', 'see', 'quot', 'Secrets', '007', 'quot', 'where', 'see', '007', 'press', 'remote', 'can', 'access', 'making', 'certain', 'scenes', 'see', 'storyboards', 'nice', 'GARBAGE', 'music', 'video', 'quot', 'World', 'not', 'Enough', 'quot', 'pretty', 'cool', 'always', 'felt', 'freaky', 'woman', 'like', 'music', 'freaky', 'video', 'very', 'cool', 'must', 'spent', 'lot', 'money', 'commentary', 'freaks', 'get', 'two', 'One', 'director', 'other', 'production', 'designer', 'unit', 'director', 'composer', 'Also', 'booklet', 'included', 'pretty', 'cool', 'booklets', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'included', 'DVD', 'well.Welcome', 'new', 'Bond', 'chance', 'share', 'psyche', 'agent', 'known', '007', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'new', 'side', 'Bond', 'was', 'not', 'easily', 'open', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'movie']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

477874,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,6305784906,D. Mok,"[3, 5]","The World Is Not Enough isn't quite bad.  It's just...bland.  After the dizzying high of GoldenEye and a fairly strong showing in Tomorrow Never Dies (Jonathan Pryce's awful performance excluded), the franchise was looking on the up and up.  The World Is Not Enough doesn't fulfill theexpectations, however; a swirl of bad choices and too much style-over-substance make this the weakest Bond film since the Roger Moore days.Pierce Brosnan shows his weak spots as an actor in this film.  The prospect of James Bond and M (dependable Judi Dench) being challenged in their moral stance is just rift with possibilities, but director Michael Apted was content with just scratching the surface of the dilemma; Brosnan, saddled with the character's guilt complex, is unable to surpass more than just a couple of puppy-dog guilty looks, and thus damages the character's credibility.  Of course, Dench and Brosnan are not helped by an atypically erratic, shallow performance by Sophie Marceau.  She is quite pretty and has shown ability in the past, but in this world, she flutters between screaming, hysterical weakling and icy, sadistic maneater with no conviction.  It's not an easy mix to begin with, and Marceau just doesn't pass the mustard.  Denise Richards is of course just a token pretty face in here, &quot;Dr. Christmas Jones&quot; easily the most laughable Bond girl in the last 20 years.  When Apted tries to make us take her seriously, the ludicrous nature of the casting choice and script sink his intentions, and when he tries to bury her into the background, it merely points out that the character is window dressing.Robert Carlyle, thankfully, offers up some solace on the acting front, projecting a more human, wounded sensibility into his terrorist character.  He, too, is relegated to the sidelines, inexplicably, in favour of the much weaker Marceau.After the pretty outrageous initial chase (where high hopes of Il Postino's Maria Grazia Cuchinotta becoming a Bond girl are dashed), the action sequences also fall low.  The ending of The World Is Not Enough is an all-time low, a vacuous attempt at a hand-to-hand fight sequence sabotaged by bad staging and shooting.  I sure hope the next Bond will pull the franchise back up, because this is  one of Bond's weakest moments.",2,Very weak.,1024444800,"06 19, 2002",2002,2291,"['World', 'Not', 'Enough', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bad', 'just', 'bland', 'dizzying', 'high', 'GoldenEye', 'fairly', 'strong', 'showing', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'awful', 'performance', 'excluded', 'franchise', 'was', 'looking', 'up', 'up', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', ""n't"", 'fulfill', 'theexpectations', 'however', 'swirl', 'bad', 'choices', 'too', 'much', 'style-over-substance', 'make', 'weakest', 'Bond', 'film', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'days.Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'weak', 'spots', 'actor', 'film', 'prospect', 'James', 'Bond', 'M', 'dependable', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'being', 'challenged', 'moral', 'stance', 'just', 'rift', 'possibilities', 'director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'was', 'content', 'just', 'scratching', 'surface', 'dilemma', 'Brosnan', 'saddled', 'character', 'guilt', 'complex', 'unable', 'surpass', 'more', 'just', 'couple', 'puppy-dog', 'guilty', 'looks', 'thus', 'damages', 'character', 'credibility', 'course', 'Dench', 'Brosnan', 'are', 'not', 'helped', 'atypically', 'erratic', 'shallow', 'performance', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'quite', 'pretty', 'shown', 'ability', 'past', 'world', 'screaming', 'hysterical', 'weakling', 'icy', 'sadistic', 'maneater', 'conviction', 'not', 'easy', 'mix', 'begin', 'Marceau', 'just', ""n't"", 'pass', 'mustard', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'course', 'just', 'token', 'pretty', 'face', 'here', 'quot', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'quot', 'easily', 'most', 'laughable', 'Bond', 'girl', 'last', '20', 'years', 'When', 'Apted', 'tries', 'make', 'take', 'seriously', 'ludicrous', 'nature', 'casting', 'choice', 'script', 'sink', 'intentions', 'when', 'bury', 'background', 'merely', 'out', 'character', 'window', 'dressing.Robert', 'Carlyle', 'thankfully', 'up', 'solace', 'acting', 'front', 'projecting', 'more', 'human', 'wounded', 'sensibility', 'terrorist', 'character', 'too', 'relegated', 'sidelines', 'inexplicably', 'favour', 'much', 'weaker', 'Marceau.After', 'pretty', 'outrageous', 'initial', 'chase', 'where', 'high', 'hopes', 'Il', 'Postino', 'Maria', 'Grazia', 'Cuchinotta', 'becoming', 'Bond', 'girl', 'are', 'dashed', 'action', 'sequences', 'also', 'fall', 'low', 'ending', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'all-time', 'low', 'vacuous', 'attempt', 'hand-to-hand', 'fight', 'sequence', 'sabotaged', 'bad', 'staging', 'shooting', 'sure', 'hope', 'next', 'Bond', 'will', 'pull', 'franchise', 'back', 'up', 'one', 'Bond', 'weakest', 'moments']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

The World Is Not Enough has two great things going for it, and thats the extent I got out of this film.  Its not a bad movie, its just not up to par with the other so many great Bond films out there.  The pre-credits scene is the best pre-credits action scene ever in a Bond film - and its the best part of this movie.  The other great thing is the character Elektra King.  Her chemistry with Bond and her own secrecy was quite mysterious.It's sad when I am waiting for the ending of a Bond movie to come.  Some parts of the movie were very good, and then there are others that just made me feel like ugh.  The story was never interesting, as much as I tried to get into it.  I won't say it was the easiest thing to follow either.  I was captivated, however, by any events surrounding Elektra.  She fooled Bond for quite some time - and me too, believing she was an innocent woman.  Though she really isn't the main villain in this film, her character was strong enough to hold the role.  The main villain, Renard,  was a big dissapointment.  He had the ability to be a very original villain, being shot in the head once and escaping death.  The result - he cannot feel anything, including any pain.  One would think such a villain would destroy his enemies in the fight scenes.  One would think.  The final fight between Renard and Bond felt very weak, despite the creativity that they are fighting in a submarine that has fliped vertically.The action was actually limited in this film too.  The action scenes that are presented, felt rather dull.  Though there is some originality with the copters that have hanging blades and saws from their base, cutting everything in sight, that was about the only interesting scene of action.  As mentioned earlier, its the pre-credits scene that steals the show.  It is the most amazing boat chase, involving the Q boat piloted by Bond, who ends up taking shortcuts through the streets and buildings in London, before landing back on the water.Pierce Brosnan actually did pretty good in this film, maybe a bit better than his previous two films.  The role of Bond seems to now fit him well, and he has found a comfortable level of flow.  Aside from Elektra, the rest of the characters were rather dull.  Again, the villain Renard is easily forgettable, and Denise Richards as Christmas Jones was embarrassing - specifically, she just can't act.  Most Bond villains have decent henchmen, but not here.  The closest we get is a guy named Bull, who is all show and no action.Ok movie overall, but one of the most uninteresting Bond films ever.  One of the best female charcaters and a great pre-credits action scene are the higlights.  Die hard fans will still find enough to appreciate it, but for those who are comfortable with films like ""Goldfinger"" and ""Spy Who Loved Me"", this just can't compare.Acting - 3Action - 3.5Characters - 3.5Story - 3Overall - 3.5",3,"[3.5] ""There's no point living if you can't feel life""",1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,3018,"['point', 'watching', 'movie', 'are', 'serious', 'Bond', 'fan', 'who', 'keep', 'up', 'film', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'two', 'great', 'things', 'going', 'extent', 'got', 'out', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'other', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'Bond', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'pre-credits', 'scene', 'best', 'pre-credits', 'action', 'scene', 'ever', 'Bond', 'film', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'other', 'great', 'thing', 'character', 'Elektra', 'King', 'chemistry', 'Bond', 'own', 'secrecy', 'was', 'quite', 'mysterious.It', 'sad', 'when', 'am', 'waiting', 'ending', 'Bond', 'movie', 'come', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'then', 'are', 'others', 'just', 'made', 'feel', 'ugh', 'story', 'was', 'never', 'interesting', 'as', 'much', 'tried', 'get', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'easiest', 'thing', 'follow', 'was', 'captivated', 'however', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Elektra', 'fooled', 'Bond', 'quite', 'time', 'too', 'believing', 'was', 'innocent', 'woman', 'really', ""n't"", 'main', 'villain', 'film', 'character', 'was', 'strong', 'enough', 'hold', 'role', 'main', 'villain', 'Renard', 'was', 'big', 'dissapointment', 'had', 'ability', 'be', 'very', 'original', 'villain', 'being', 'shot', 'head', 'once', 'escaping', 'death', 'result', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'anything', 'including', 'pain', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'villain', 'would', 'destroy', 'enemies', 'fight', 'scenes', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'final', 'fight', 'Renard', 'Bond', 'felt', 'very', 'weak', 'creativity', 'are', 'fighting', 'submarine', 'fliped', 'vertically.The', 'action', 'was', 'actually', 'limited', 'film', 'too', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'presented', 'felt', 'rather', 'dull', 'originality', 'copters', 'have', 'hanging', 'blades', 'saws', 'base', 'cutting', 'everything', 'sight', 'was', 'only', 'interesting', 'scene', 'action', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'pre-credits', 'scene', 'show', 'most', 'amazing', 'boat', 'chase', 'involving', 'Q', 'boat', 'piloted', 'Bond', 'who', 'up', 'taking', 'shortcuts', 'streets', 'buildings', 'London', 'landing', 'back', 'water.Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'actually', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'maybe', 'bit', 'better', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'role', 'Bond', 'now', 'fit', 'well', 'found', 'comfortable', 'level', 'flow', 'Aside', 'Elektra', 'rest', 'characters', 'were', 'rather', 'dull', 'Again', 'villain', 'Renard', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'specifically', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Most', 'Bond', 'villains', 'have', 'decent', 'henchmen', 'not', 'here', 'closest', 'get', 'guy', 'named', 'Bull', 'who', 'show', 'action.Ok', 'movie', 'overall', 'one', 'most', 'uninteresting', 'Bond', 'films', 'ever', 'One', 'best', 'female', 'charcaters', 'great', 'pre-credits', 'action', 'scene', 'are', 'higlights', 'Die', 'hard', 'fans', 'will', 'still', 'find', 'enough', 'appreciate', 'who', 'are', 'comfortable', 'films', 'Goldfinger', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Loved', 'Me', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare.Acting', '3Action', '3.5Characters', '3.5Story', '3Overall', '3.5']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Personally, I love it when the  creators try to depart from the norm, and TWINE is one of the best examples  of this.  To begin with, it actually has a plot!  I agree, it's not the  best plot I've ever seen, but in Bond films the plot does not have to be  airtight, and at least there is more to this one than the stupid  action-driven premise of TND.  Brosnan is seriously trying to portray 007  as a real person, rather than the suave superhero parody that Moore was  trying to be.  Carlyle is great as the new millenium's Jaws, although he is  seriously underused.  The action is not non-stop, but when it comes it is  breathtakingly done.  Come on, admit it - you never expected that second  parafoil to open up, did you?

As usual in these cases I shall do my best to convince you about the true nature of this movie , and help you to come to the pass over decision .Upon seeing this Bond flick , soon enough would you come to terms with the fact that this film belongs to the ""has no standing ability whatsoever"" category . The plot is one of the weakest , stupidest and most embarrassing the silver screen has suffered from the Bond's series . As an avid Bond's fan I do claim to be , I had to digest confusing nets of conspiracies on top of conspiracies, which are interweaved together on account of vague reasons of revenge , spite , power and greed . I feel like there is no point in even trying to track down the main occurrences and actions since they are generally puzzling , on occasions disconnected , and frustrating even to the most welcoming and patient viewer .This time it is not my opinion alone , since I share the same feelings with a bunch of guys that had seen the movie and became completely numb in the end . The feeling was so common that we just looked at each other with no expression on our faces and immediately continued to another movie to erase and forget the disappointment and rage .Nevertheless , to hit the main problem , it seems the main action scenes were designed to meet the hunger for pyrotechnics of the special effects division , and not the plot's ones . Unfortunately , these needs were taken to the extreme and left no room for real movie . In other words , the viewer gets the impression that someone had thought first of the way and style the fights and battles would have to be conducted , the landscape and the places in which they are going to take place , the High-Tech gadgets that would participate , and then , only then , built a framework story . It does not work .I know people also expect these kind of things from a Bond's release , but you will have to believe me the outcome has crossed the line this time . This motion picture is almost a complete joke and disgraces the entire series . Even if considered as an attempt to be a farce about the Bond's series (which is a declared farce on spy movies in the first place , and sometimes a good one) it fails inclusively in almost each and every aspect you can think of : script , acting , logical sequence , dialogue and even in the love scenes .

However, after seeing Tomorrow Will Never Die, I guess I shouldn't have expected much.  The action scenes- as well as everything else about the movie- were just so banally cliche and overdone, and the plot wasn't anything special at all. I also thought the thing about the villian was rather stupid and hokey-- &quot;he was shot in the head, so he will continue to grow stronger and stronger until he dies&quot;. Ummm.....yeah, ok. Well thank god the movie didn't even follow that absurd premise much. Bond films used to be smart, creative and original with unique and fresh scripts. Now, just like most other action movies and sequels and whatnot (recent Bond films, M:I-2, Charlie's Angels, on and on and on) they're just like any other movie out there with snowmobile chases and big explosions. Only with british accents and crazy gadgets. The James Bond series has unfortunately fallen into a very derivative rut, it seems. And I mean really, was there any difference between Tomorrow Will Never Die and The World is Not Enough? I don't think so. God forbid they do something original, creative or intelligent with the series like they used to. They may as well just have named it &quot;Clich&eacute;d 90s Action Movie #463&quot;.  Also, while most of the cast was fairly good (I think Bronsan makes one of the best Bond yet, a distant second only to Connery), did they really have to write in a physicist named &quot;Christman Jones&quot;, played by the very young, beautiful, untalented and unconvincingly-&quot;smart&quot; Denise Richards?  That did nothing for the movie.But I guess you can't blame'em. They're just catering to the average American audience, who would rather sit through mindless car chases and explosions than something that takes half a brain to appreciate (M:I --&gt; M:I2 , for example....ugh).  If you're a fan of *real* James Bond movies and what made them so popular, infamous and stand out in the first place, skip this movie.

477893,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305784906,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 0]","This is the 19th installment of what has become an institution in filmmaking.  James Bond has to be the most enduring of characters in film.  He has been in Her Majesty's Secret Service for almost 40 years now and  barely looks 45!  ""TWINE"" is true to the late Bond formula.  A flimsy  script serves as an excuse for Bond to wreak havoc and mayhem on evildoers  in the name of saving the world.  As always, it is full of gadgets, gizmos,  lots of corny puns, serial sexual conquests, pyrotechnics, and stunts  galore.  It is a genre unto itself, part comedy, part action/adventure, and  part sex fantasy.This installment concentrated on taking the action and  stunts to a new and exciting level and in that regard succeeded  brilliantly.  This was one of the most impressively stunt intense films  I've ever seen.  There were stunts that made use of every element; air,  water, earth and fire.  Michael Apted set the bar at a new level with  innovative and complex stunt work brilliantly done.  The DVD has a bonus  feature that gives behind the scenes looks at the stunts and you get a real  appreciation for how much planning and work goes into setting each one up.  I was surprised to learn that Pierce Brosnan actually did some of his own  stunts.  Also, Apted's choice of locations was fabulous, with some of the  most majestic backdrops you will ever see in an action flick.As  impressive as the action was, I still long for the days when James Bond  films were stories of international intrigue, with strong and mysterious  plot lines, rather than a predictable succession of death defying chase  scenes.Pierce Brosnan gets high marks this time out in the starring  role.  He was witty, charming, cool, tough and very athletic.  Sophie  Marceau was alluring as the victim turned villain, though the part was  limited in scope.  Besides her bewitching beauty, Marceau is a terrific  dramatic actor and this part really didn't allow her much opportunity to  show the breadth of her talents (See `Firelight' if you want a better  example).Denise Richards landed her first part playing a grownup in  this film.  Her character was included strictly for the titillation factor,  a role for which Richards was correctly cast and is amply equipped.  Fortunately, the part did not have a heavy line load and didn't require any  real acting, an area in which she has scant assets.John Cleese is no  substitute for the late and irreplaceable Desmond Llewelyn as the  gadgetmaster Q.  After 17 appearances, he will be sorely missed.This  film gets a 10 for the action sequences, and about a 4 for the story.  I  split the difference and gave it a 7/10 overall.  As Bond films go, this  was one of the more entertaining in recent memory.  Action fans will love  it.  For those looking for an intriguing plot line, probably not.",4,"Great stunts, mediocre plot",959472000,"05 28, 2000",2000,2821,"['19th', 'installment', 'what', 'become', 'institution', 'filmmaking', 'James', 'Bond', 'be', 'most', 'enduring', 'characters', 'film', 'been', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'now', 'barely', '45', 'TWINE', 'true', 'late', 'Bond', 'formula', 'flimsy', 'script', 'serves', 'excuse', 'Bond', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'mayhem', 'evildoers', 'name', 'saving', 'world', 'always', 'full', 'gadgets', 'gizmos', 'lots', 'corny', 'puns', 'serial', 'sexual', 'conquests', 'pyrotechnics', 'stunts', 'galore', 'genre', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'action/adventure', 'part', 'sex', 'fantasy.This', 'installment', 'concentrated', 'taking', 'action', 'stunts', 'new', 'exciting', 'level', 'regard', 'succeeded', 'brilliantly', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'impressively', 'stunt', 'intense', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'were', 'stunts', 'made', 'use', 'element', 'air', 'water', 'earth', 'fire', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'set', 'bar', 'new', 'level', 'innovative', 'complex', 'stunt', 'work', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'feature', 'scenes', 'stunts', 'get', 'real', 'appreciation', 'how', 'much', 'planning', 'work', 'setting', 'one', 'up', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'actually', 'did', 'own', 'stunts', 'Also', 'Apted', 'choice', 'locations', 'was', 'fabulous', 'most', 'majestic', 'backdrops', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'action', 'flick.As', 'impressive', 'action', 'was', 'still', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'were', 'stories', 'international', 'intrigue', 'strong', 'mysterious', 'plot', 'lines', 'rather', 'predictable', 'succession', 'death', 'defying', 'chase', 'scenes.Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'high', 'marks', 'time', 'out', 'starring', 'role', 'was', 'witty', 'charming', 'cool', 'tough', 'very', 'athletic', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'was', 'alluring', 'victim', 'turned', 'villain', 'part', 'was', 'limited', 'scope', 'bewitching', 'beauty', 'Marceau', 'terrific', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'part', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'much', 'opportunity', 'show', 'breadth', 'talents', 'See', 'Firelight', 'want', 'better', 'example', '.Denise', 'Richards', 'landed', 'first', 'part', 'playing', 'grownup', 'film', 'character', 'was', 'included', 'strictly', 'titillation', 'factor', 'role', 'Richards', 'was', 'correctly', 'cast', 'amply', 'equipped', 'Fortunately', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'heavy', 'line', 'load', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'real', 'acting', 'area', 'scant', 'Cleese', 'substitute', 'late', 'irreplaceable', 'Desmond', 'Llewelyn', 'gadgetmaster', 'Q', '17', 'appearances', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'missed.This', 'film', '10', 'action', 'sequences', '4', 'story', 'split', 'difference', 'gave', '7/10', 'overall', 'Bond', 'films', 'go', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'entertaining', 'recent', 'memory', 'Action', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'looking', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'line', 'probably', 'not']",The World Is Not Enough VHS
477894,A1DA6E4FNRSAWN,6305784906,Furio,"[2, 2]","I have been reading several negative reviews about this Bond episode and the only explanation I can give myself is that what so many people have hated is exactly what I have liked.Admittedly this is not your usual Bond plot: there is plenty of action scenes, including the classical pursuit, this time Bond chasing a handsome sniper(ess) on the Thames; there is the usual plot to conquer/destroy the world, etc. but the general atmosphere is completely different, dark, gloomy, realistic.That is my point, the plot is realistic: the villains' motives are perfectly clear and understandable from the point of view of general, globalised economy. In you put a decaying Russian empire with all its leaks of corruption, weapon trafficking, inefficient government. In you put the blatant inefficiency of the British (read Western) governments too.Then we have two superb villains, both unquestionably evil: one, a splendid Sophie Marceau who becomes such out of a desperate sense of abandonment and revenge, the other, the terrorist, who surprises us by being capable of loving tenderly and fully.There is no black and white here, just a murky gray that taints everything and I can very well see how this adult vision may have displeased many Bond fans.Five stars cannot be given to this glorious attempt though: the script is faulty and there are some really cheesy lines including, unfortunately, the usual love banter between Bond and the Beauty at the end of the film. Direction is not flawless either: here and there the rhythm falters and is regained with an effort. Too bad.Acting is not as bad though as stated by many.

A gargantuan yawn-machine filled with awful dialogue and clumsy plot points, this one sits in the Bond series cellar with &quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot; and &quot;Live and Let Die.&quot;This film just implodes with too much dull, cliched plotting. The entire film is one long set up, where every character must make another startling revelation that steers the plot into another unneeded direction. In fact, plot details are still developing during the ludicrous climax, which involves M being captured by the villains. The film also loses that careful balance of humor, action, and gadgets, which renders the &quot;serious&quot; scenes silly and contrived. Then there's the action scenes, which are technically impressive but are so long that they failed to hold my attention.There are two things that worked well, for me at least. I found Denise Richards to be surprisingly fun and energetic, probably the only person having any fun in the movie. She added some spark to otherwise dull and overblown action sequences. I also really liked the opening action scene on the River Thames. Ultimately, I disappointed by the lack of substance behind the film's highly polished look and the lame dialogue.

477898,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,6305784906,Gary P. Cohen,"[0, 2]","""The World Is Not Enough"" is a pretty good though not particularly memorable Bond film, it does not come anywhere near the great Bond flicks.  Released in 1999, the film was Brosnan's 3rd Bond film.  It is interesting that Brosnan started at the top with the terrific ""Goldeneye"" and worked his way downward with each suceeding film.  (While this film is not great, his next and last Bond film ""Die Another Day"" was far worse, an absolute mediocrity.)  This film does make you remember, despite all the Daniel Craig mania, just what a good Bond Brosnan was.  I read a recent interview with him where he is still unclear why the producers of the Bond films let him go, feeling he had at least 2 more Bonds left in him.  I absolutely agree that he had a couple more Bonds.  However he did have a habit of shooting his mouth off too much and advising who he would like to direct the next Bond film, people like like Quentin Tarantino.  Perhaps the producers felt he was too much trouble.  For whatever reason, he was let go but he was a good Bond.  (I really don't think that there has ever been a bad Bond, although Connery is still my favorite.)""The World Is Not Enough"" has a relatively serious script that basically concerns Bond's attempts to protect a beautiful heiress attempting to build the world's longest oil pipeline.  The heiress is played by beautiful French actress Sophie Marceau, coming right after ""Braveheart.""  Her character is one of the more serious and interesting Bond female leads and she does do a good job of it.  The second female lead proably involves one of the silliest bits of miscasting in any Bond film: California bimbo-type Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, a NUCLEAR PHYSICIST!!!! (Yes, you heard right.)  This casting is silly but it did create some interest in the film.  (I can remember how excited my friends were after seeing her in ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Wild Things,"" feeling she was one of the hottest women in the world.  However she never really looks that great in this film, being dressed down most of the time.  She never really looks truly spectacular until the final scene.)  This film also features Robert Carlyle doing a fine job as the villain Reynaud, the great Robbie Coltrane reprising his role as the Russian gangster from ""Goldeneye"" and the wonderful Desmond Llewelyn in his final appearance as Q.)The action scenes are okay at best (although they are a million times better than anything in the most recent Bond ""Quantum of Solace."")  The opening sequence is the longest in Bond history and features a motorboat chase down the Thames.  It is okay but still nowhere as enjoyable as the motorboat scene in ""Live and Let Die.""  There is a silly and unexciting segment of Bond and Electra (Marceau) on skis being attacked by some bizarre ""parahawks.""  (This whole scene makes no sense in the larger context of the film.)  The one really good action action scene is of Bond being attacked by helicoptors with hanging, whirling blades, normally used to cut off the tops of tress.  This is an exciting sequence and Brosnan does a lot of running, jumping and shooting.  The conclusion has Bond attempting to prevent a nuclear device from going off aboard a sunken Russian submarine and fighting the evil Carlyle, who is impervious to pain, at the same time.  It is fairly exciting, though nothing great by Bond standards.  The same could be said of this film: it is a pretty good movie.  However Bond films are in a class by themselves and this is simply not one of the greater ones.The picture and sound on the blu-ray are great.  Among the extras are deleted scenes with on-screen introductions by the director, Michael Apted.  Theres a ""making of"" documentary with some bimbo who obviously knew very little about the Bond films interviewing the cast and director.  This was obviously made for tv and used for publicity around the time of the film's release. There is also a nice tribute to Desmond Llewelyn who made his final appearance as Q in the film.  Llewelyn was sadly killed in a car crash not long after the film was completed, although this was thought to be his last Bond film appearance at the time he made it and he does get a nice send-off in the film.",4,"Good,Though Not Particularly Memorable Bond Film",1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,4227,"['World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'Bond', 'film', 'not', 'come', 'anywhere', 'great', 'Bond', 'flicks', 'Released', '1999', 'film', 'was', 'Brosnan', '3rd', 'Bond', 'film', 'interesting', 'Brosnan', 'started', 'top', 'terrific', 'Goldeneye', 'worked', 'way', 'downward', 'suceeding', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'next', 'last', 'Bond', 'film', 'Die', 'Day', 'was', 'far', 'worse', 'absolute', 'mediocrity', 'film', 'make', 'remember', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'mania', 'just', 'what', 'good', 'Bond', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'read', 'recent', 'interview', 'where', 'still', 'unclear', 'why', 'producers', 'Bond', 'films', 'let', 'go', 'feeling', 'had', 'least', '2', 'more', 'Bonds', 'left', 'absolutely', 'agree', 'had', 'couple', 'more', 'Bonds', 'However', 'did', 'have', 'habit', 'shooting', 'mouth', 'too', 'much', 'advising', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'direct', 'next', 'Bond', 'film', 'people', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Perhaps', 'producers', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'reason', 'was', 'let', 'go', 'was', 'good', 'Bond', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'been', 'bad', 'Bond', 'Connery', 'still', 'favorite', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'relatively', 'serious', 'script', 'basically', 'Bond', 'attempts', 'protect', 'beautiful', 'heiress', 'attempting', 'build', 'world', 'longest', 'oil', 'pipeline', 'heiress', 'played', 'beautiful', 'French', 'actress', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'coming', 'right', 'Braveheart', 'character', 'one', 'more', 'serious', 'interesting', 'Bond', 'female', 'leads', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'second', 'female', 'lead', 'proably', 'one', 'silliest', 'bits', 'miscasting', 'Bond', 'film', 'California', 'bimbo-type', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'NUCLEAR', 'PHYSICIST', 'Yes', 'heard', 'right', 'casting', 'silly', 'did', 'create', 'interest', 'film', 'can', 'remember', 'how', 'excited', 'friends', 'were', 'seeing', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Wild', 'Things', 'feeling', 'was', 'one', 'hottest', 'women', 'world', 'However', 'never', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'being', 'dressed', 'down', 'most', 'time', 'never', 'really', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'also', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'doing', 'fine', 'job', 'villain', 'Reynaud', 'great', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'reprising', 'role', 'Russian', 'gangster', 'Goldeneye', 'wonderful', 'Desmond', 'Llewelyn', 'final', 'appearance', 'Q', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'okay', 'best', 'are', 'million', 'times', 'better', 'anything', 'most', 'recent', 'Bond', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'opening', 'sequence', 'longest', 'Bond', 'history', 'motorboat', 'chase', 'down', 'Thames', 'okay', 'still', 'nowhere', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'motorboat', 'scene', 'Live', 'Let', 'Die', 'silly', 'unexciting', 'segment', 'Bond', 'Electra', 'Marceau', 'skis', 'being', 'attacked', 'bizarre', 'parahawks', 'whole', 'scene', 'sense', 'larger', 'context', 'film', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'action', 'action', 'scene', 'Bond', 'being', 'attacked', 'helicoptors', 'hanging', 'whirling', 'blades', 'normally', 'used', 'cut', 'off', 'tops', 'tress', 'exciting', 'sequence', 'Brosnan', 'lot', 'running', 'jumping', 'shooting', 'conclusion', 'Bond', 'attempting', 'prevent', 'nuclear', 'device', 'going', 'off', 'sunken', 'Russian', 'submarine', 'fighting', 'evil', 'Carlyle', 'who', 'impervious', 'pain', 'same', 'time', 'fairly', 'exciting', 'nothing', 'great', 'Bond', 'standards', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'However', 'Bond', 'films', 'are', 'class', 'simply', 'not', 'one', 'greater', 'ones.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'blu-ray', 'are', 'great', 'extras', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'on-screen', 'introductions', 'director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'making', 'documentary', 'bimbo', 'who', 'obviously', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'Bond', 'films', 'interviewing', 'cast', 'director', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'tv', 'used', 'publicity', 'time', 'film', 'release', 'also', 'nice', 'tribute', 'Desmond', 'Llewelyn', 'who', 'made', 'final', 'appearance', 'Q', 'film', 'Llewelyn', 'was', 'sadly', 'killed', 'car', 'crash', 'not', 'long', 'film', 'was', 'completed', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'last', 'Bond', 'film', 'appearance', 'time', 'made', 'get', 'nice', 'send-off', 'film']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Unfortunately this idea never really comes satisfactorily to fruition, as the essential plot elements are not fully explored. They are forsaken at the expense of some unimaginative action sequences and a protracted additional love interest in the form of Dr. Christmas Jones.

477904,AGQ8TQ8U3KG19,6305784906,"""goodboygonebadd""","[3, 4]","THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (TWINE) edges out GOLDENEYE by a narrow margin to claim the title of best Brosnan Bond, in my opinion.  The plot is intriguing and Brosnan as Bond displays a little bit more complexity this time around.  We get hints that Bond actually feels.  Another plus is Sophie Marceau in what is probably the best Bond girl role.  Her role has even more complexity and depth to it, and in my opinion, she makes this movie.The plot revolves around the murder of British Oil magnate Sir Robert King.  Bond eventually begins to suspect that the tycoon was killed by a shadowy terrorist named Renard (Robert Carlyle) who kidnapped King's daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau) several years ago.  At M's behest, King did not pay the ransom (due to the UK government's policy to not negotiate with terrorists).  Elektra eventually managed to escape, and Renard wasn't heard from again.  Until now.  Fearing Renard is trying to exact revenge for the botched kidnapping, Bond travels to Elektra's side to protect her.  But there is more to Elektra than meet's the eye....  And this is where the movie kicks into high gear.  Bond finds himself in the middle of an attempt to steal a nuclear bomb from a decomissioned test site.  The terrorists succeed, and nearly manage to kill Bond and one of the nuclear scientists at the site, Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards, in a severely underrated performance).  Suspecting the worst about Elektra and Renard, Bond teams up with Christmas and they race against time to foil a plot to destroy competing oil pipe-lines before it's too late.What separates TWINE from its predecessors is a marked complexity to the proceedings.  No one is completely good or evil.  Everyone is flawed and painted in shades of gray.  Bond is better here than he's ever been in the hands of Brosnan.  Sophie Marceau is simply terrific as the multi-layered Elektra.  Renard is a little underutilized and underdeveloped, but Carlyle makes it work because of his skills.  Denise Richards has caught a lot of flack for her performance.  Even I thought she was miscast when I first saw this movie, but now I realize its because Sophie Marceau is so awesome as Elektra that any other Bond girl would suffer in comparison.  Upon subsequent viewings, I've decided that Denise Richards really isn't so bad.  Her introductory scenes are smartly played.  She has a real sass in these scenes.  She may appear too young, but hey this is a Bond movie.  The real fault lies with the writers.  As good as this story is, they should have filled out her role a little bit more.  Denise Richards did what she could with the material, and I think has been the unfair target of critics.  The writers should have let her defuse the bomb at the end of movie, allowing her to leave a stronger impression.  Instead, it's Bond who saves the day again.  But I guess that's the point.All in all, this a great Bond movie.  Complex, surprising, with texture and depth.  Let's hope DIE ANOTHER DAY is as good.  And once more, Sophie Marceau is the best Bond girl.  A close second, third, and fourth are Izabella Scorupco and Famke Janssen (Natalya Simonova and Xenia Onatopp, respectively,in GOLDENEYE) and Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones (she really isn't that bad, folks).",4,"Best of the Brosnan Bonds: Complex plot, complex characters.",1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,3275,"['WORLD', 'IS', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', 'TWINE', 'out', 'GOLDENEYE', 'narrow', 'margin', 'claim', 'title', 'best', 'Brosnan', 'Bond', 'opinion', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'Brosnan', 'Bond', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'complexity', 'time', 'around', 'get', 'hints', 'Bond', 'actually', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'what', 'probably', 'best', 'Bond', 'girl', 'role', 'role', 'even', 'more', 'complexity', 'depth', 'opinion', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'murder', 'British', 'Oil', 'magnate', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'King', 'Bond', 'eventually', 'suspect', 'tycoon', 'was', 'killed', 'shadowy', 'terrorist', 'named', 'Renard', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'King', 'daughter', 'Elektra', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'M', 'behest', 'King', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'ransom', 'due', 'UK', 'government', 'policy', 'not', 'negotiate', 'terrorists', 'Elektra', 'eventually', 'managed', 'escape', 'Renard', 'was', ""n't"", 'heard', 'again', 'now', 'Fearing', 'Renard', 'trying', 'exact', 'revenge', 'botched', 'kidnapping', 'Bond', 'Elektra', 'side', 'protect', 'more', 'Elektra', 'meet', 'eye', 'where', 'movie', 'high', 'gear', 'Bond', 'middle', 'attempt', 'steal', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'decomissioned', 'test', 'site', 'terrorists', 'succeed', 'nearly', 'manage', 'kill', 'Bond', 'one', 'nuclear', 'scientists', 'site', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'severely', 'underrated', 'performance', 'Suspecting', 'worst', 'Elektra', 'Renard', 'Bond', 'up', 'Christmas', 'race', 'time', 'foil', 'plot', 'destroy', 'competing', 'oil', 'pipe-lines', 'too', 'late.What', 'separates', 'TWINE', 'predecessors', 'marked', 'complexity', 'proceedings', 'one', 'completely', 'good', 'evil', 'Everyone', 'flawed', 'painted', 'shades', 'gray', 'Bond', 'better', 'here', 'ever', 'been', 'hands', 'Brosnan', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'simply', 'terrific', 'multi-layered', 'Elektra', 'Renard', 'little', 'underutilized', 'underdeveloped', 'Carlyle', 'work', 'skills', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'caught', 'lot', 'flack', 'performance', 'Even', 'thought', 'was', 'miscast', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'now', 'realize', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'so', 'awesome', 'Elektra', 'other', 'Bond', 'girl', 'would', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'subsequent', 'viewings', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'really', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'introductory', 'scenes', 'are', 'smartly', 'played', 'real', 'sass', 'scenes', 'may', 'appear', 'too', 'young', 'Bond', 'movie', 'real', 'fault', 'writers', 'As', 'good', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'filled', 'out', 'role', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'material', 'think', 'been', 'unfair', 'target', 'critics', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'end', 'movie', 'allowing', 'leave', 'stronger', 'impression', 'Instead', 'Bond', 'who', 'day', 'again', 'guess', 'point.All', 'great', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Complex', 'surprising', 'texture', 'depth', 'Let', 'hope', 'DIE', 'ANOTHER', 'DAY', 'as', 'good', 'once', 'more', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'best', 'Bond', 'girl', 'close', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'are', 'Izabella', 'Scorupco', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Natalya', 'Simonova', 'Xenia', 'Onatopp', 'respectively', 'GOLDENEYE', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'folks']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Many people have said that they think that this newest Bond movie,  &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, is good. It's not particularly bad- it  just isn't up to previous standards set.The plot, while fairly  simplistic, was still hard to follow, and at times you couldn't understand  who was the bad guy, or why. It would have helped had they developed the  characters more- then you might have had more insight into the entire  development of the plot. The special effects and stunts were fairly good,  as always, but they weren't as memorable as many of the famous scenes from  other movies (such as the jump off the dam in Goldeneye).

477909,A3B08DCVOC1BDI,6305784906,"""halo1000""","[0, 1]","OK, let's face it, Bond fans, this wasn't exactly the best Bond movie ever made (Goldfinger still holds that title), but it certainly wasn't the worst either (that still goes to On Her Majesty's secret Service). And I also want to point out that this Bond movie is still better than just about anything that's been released in the last two months. The production values were certainly more over the top than, say Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies, but that was expected. With technology getting better, the Bond movies will, in fact, change with the technology.The plot for this Bond was different from some of the other ones, since the enemy happened to be a man, Reinard, that was practically unstoppable, since he had a bullet in his head. Bond's assignment is to protect Elektra King, the daughter of a wealthy oil tycoon because of fear Reinard could strike against her. Along the way, the chase takes him to Valentine's  caviar factory, which Bond nearly destroys, to a chase through the oil pipeline to diffuse a bomb, to motor boat and air-balloon chase over London's Millenium Dome, to the underwater finale.My only complaint for this Bond movie was the choice of Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones (I don't think they could've come up with a stupider name, either). She kind of gave the whole movie an especially cheesy feel, because either she was trying too hard or not hard enough. Especially with my favorite line in the movie where she yells &quot;James! It's too risky!&quot;. Come on! You're talking to a guy who's jumped off a cliff to catch a crashing plane (Goldeneye), wrestled with Jaws 30,000 feet above groud(Moonraker), not to mention the countless amount of times he's nearly escaped death, and you're saying &quot;It's too risky&quot;? Never, ever tell Bond that anything's too risky.Other than Denise Richards, this Bond was one of the best yet, and proves that no matter what happens, there's always going to be James Bond in some form or another. The scenery for this movie was really something, too. Brosnan should be commended as Bond's savior, since Dalton nearly brought the franchise down.",4,"Not the best Bond, not the worst, either",987033600,"04 12, 2001",2001,2128,"['OK', 'let', 'face', 'Bond', 'fans', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'best', 'Bond', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Goldfinger', 'still', 'title', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'still', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'secret', 'Service', 'also', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'Bond', 'movie', 'still', 'better', 'just', 'anything', 'been', 'released', 'last', 'two', 'months', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'certainly', 'more', 'top', 'say', 'Goldeneye', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'was', 'expected', 'technology', 'getting', 'better', 'Bond', 'movies', 'will', 'fact', 'change', 'technology.The', 'plot', 'Bond', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'ones', 'enemy', 'happened', 'be', 'man', 'Reinard', 'was', 'practically', 'unstoppable', 'had', 'bullet', 'head', 'Bond', 'assignment', 'protect', 'Elektra', 'King', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'fear', 'Reinard', 'could', 'strike', 'way', 'chase', 'Valentine', 'caviar', 'factory', 'Bond', 'nearly', 'destroys', 'chase', 'oil', 'pipeline', 'diffuse', 'bomb', 'motor', 'boat', 'air-balloon', 'chase', 'London', 'Millenium', 'Dome', 'underwater', 'only', 'complaint', 'Bond', 'movie', 'was', 'choice', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'come', 'up', 'stupider', 'name', 'kind', 'gave', 'whole', 'movie', 'especially', 'cheesy', 'feel', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'not', 'hard', 'enough', 'Especially', 'favorite', 'line', 'movie', 'where', 'quot', 'James', 'too', 'risky', 'quot', 'Come', ""'re"", 'talking', 'guy', 'who', 'jumped', 'off', 'cliff', 'catch', 'crashing', 'plane', 'Goldeneye', 'wrestled', 'Jaws', '30,000', 'feet', 'groud', 'Moonraker', 'not', 'mention', 'countless', 'amount', 'times', 'nearly', 'escaped', 'death', ""'re"", 'saying', 'quot', 'too', 'risky', 'quot', 'Never', 'ever', 'tell', 'Bond', 'anything', 'too', 'risky.Other', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Bond', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'yet', 'matter', 'what', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'James', 'Bond', 'form', 'scenery', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'too', 'Brosnan', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'Bond', 'savior', 'Dalton', 'nearly', 'brought', 'franchise', 'down']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

477913,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,6305784906,Henry Platte,"[1, 2]","This is the best film to date in the series, hands-down. It may not have the classic charm of Goldfinger, but a couple of viewings (something most people aren't willing to credit a Bond film with) reveal a film which is incredibly substantial, in an unprecedented - and unnecesary - way. It could get by on the charm of the locations, one-liners etc., but it still tries to put together a credible and interesting plot, and it succeeds.The most obvious credit to the writers is Carlyle's brooding, existentialist villain, which reminded me of The Misfit in O'Connor's 'A Good Man is Hard to Find.' Carlyle, in surprising contrast to his turn as the psychotic Begbie in Trainspotting, plays the role with just enough subtley and understatement, making the character's evil much more believable than the cackling megalomania of earlier specimens. What I also like about the screenplay, though, and what isn't immediatley apparent, is that it casts some doubt on the role of Bond in the world. In other movies, he seems to have an absolute moral imperative, able to gun down scores of people without any consequence, simply because his enemies are abosolutley evil. In this film, though, among the ruins of the USSR (a theme already explored in Goldeneye), there's more gray than black and white, and the circumstances don't allow him to get off so blamelessly; ultimately he has to do something which he might might regret. It's far from making him human - if that were to happen, it would undermine the whole promise of the series - but it's an interesting take. Then there's the way the plot works in minor characters, like Judi Dench's M and the Russian gangster Zukovsky, both of whom provide a usually self-reliant Bond with indispensable help, while Zukovsky experiences the closest thing to character _development_ which anyone has probably ever experienced in a Bond film. As for Richards, I don't know what she's doing there, either, and probably it would have been a stronger movie without her, but at least she's hot.",5,&quot;I never miss&quot;,1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,2026,"['best', 'film', 'date', 'series', 'hands-down', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'classic', 'charm', 'Goldfinger', 'couple', 'viewings', 'something', 'most', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'willing', 'credit', 'Bond', 'film', 'reveal', 'film', 'incredibly', 'substantial', 'unprecedented', 'unnecesary', 'way', 'could', 'get', 'charm', 'locations', 'one-liners', 'etc.', 'still', 'put', 'together', 'credible', 'interesting', 'plot', 'most', 'obvious', 'credit', 'writers', 'Carlyle', 'brooding', 'existentialist', 'villain', 'reminded', 'Misfit', ""O'Connor"", 'A', 'Good', 'Man', 'Hard', 'Find', 'Carlyle', 'surprising', 'contrast', 'turn', 'psychotic', 'Begbie', 'Trainspotting', 'role', 'just', 'enough', 'subtley', 'understatement', 'making', 'character', 'evil', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'cackling', 'megalomania', 'earlier', 'specimens', 'What', 'also', 'like', 'screenplay', 'what', ""n't"", 'immediatley', 'apparent', 'doubt', 'role', 'Bond', 'world', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'absolute', 'moral', 'imperative', 'able', 'gun', 'down', 'scores', 'people', 'consequence', 'simply', 'enemies', 'are', 'abosolutley', 'evil', 'film', 'ruins', 'USSR', 'theme', 'already', 'explored', 'Goldeneye', 'more', 'gray', 'black', 'white', 'circumstances', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'get', 'off', 'so', 'blamelessly', 'ultimately', 'do', 'something', 'might', 'might', 'regret', 'far', 'making', 'human', 'were', 'happen', 'would', 'undermine', 'whole', 'promise', 'series', 'interesting', 'take', 'Then', 'way', 'plot', 'minor', 'characters', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'M', 'Russian', 'gangster', 'Zukovsky', 'whom', 'provide', 'usually', 'self-reliant', 'Bond', 'indispensable', 'help', 'Zukovsky', 'closest', 'thing', 'character', '_development_', 'anyone', 'probably', 'ever', 'experienced', 'Bond', 'film', 'Richards', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'there', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'movie', 'least', 'hot']",The World Is Not Enough VHS
477914,A3N0AXNEZVE686,6305784906,Hound Dog,"[0, 0]","Pierce Brosnan returned for Round 3 as the legendary James Bond in the franchise's 1999  installment, ""The World is Not Enough,"" co-starring elegant Sophie Marceau (as oil heiress Elektra King), Robert Carlyle (as villainous Renard), and Denise Richards (as physicist Dr. Christmas Jones), with expanded roles for returnees Judi Dench (as M) and Robbie Coltrane (as opportunistic mobster Valentin Zukovsky).  Brosnan reportedly insisted upon far more character depth and a less complicated story this time.  Fortunately, he only got the former, as much like 1995's ""Goldeneye,"" this film posseses an impressively sophisticated storyline and logical plot twists making it a very worthy entry for the now-50 year old Bond franchise.All the best elements of 007's Pierce Brosnan era (1995-2002) are present in this movie: an awesome title song by Garbage, sleek acting, adrenaline-pumping stunts, and an intelligently written script offering genuine international suspense and plenty of slam-bang for the buck.  The film's only significant detriment is the inexplicable miscasting of Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist.  Obviously, the Bond production team sacrificed credibility for eye candy, but Richards tries her best to no avail.  Even so, it proves a costly, distracting error in the film's second half when the extent of the villains' scheme takes precedence, and Bond's supposed back-up in defusing a stolen nuclear bomb simply appears so implausible.  Instead, perhaps stunning Maria Grazia Cuccinotta (seen in the pre-credits sequence as the ill-fated ""Cigar Girl) should have received an expanded role and participated as Bond's cohort in order to seek some payback against Renard.  Yes, it is a moot point, but the Bond production team should have already learned its lesson from similarly inept choices for Bond Girls in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""View to a Kill.""Ultimately, despite the Denise Richards casting issue, ""The World is Not Enough"" deserves recognition for a classy, top-notch Bond film that is willing to take chances in order to best serve the surprisingly provocative script. In conclusion, special kudos should be given to Brosnan, Marceau, Carlyle, Dench, and Coltrane for keeping audiences guessing as to what will happen next.  In closing, the classy final scene of Desmond Llewellyn as Q was the worth the price of admission for me, as his few moments of screen time far outclassed his buffoonish replacement in John Cleese.Rating: 8/10 stars.

When Mr. King leaves, Bond sits down to have a cordial drink with ""M"". After the ice in his drink begins to fizz, he notices it has been poisoned. Bond suddenly gets the notion to run to the safe to stop Mr. King.  As King gets near the billetes of money, the special pin on King's lapel sets off a bomb in the money.  It kills Robert King instantly.Later at the funeral, Bond is briefed about Robert King's daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau).

477923,A19IPL2GDZSS3G,6305784906,Jamie Bouadana,"[8, 9]","Pierce Brosnan's third outing as James Bond and a slew of controversy if it will be his last.Feeling responsible for the death of a British oil tycoon and a friend, who died in an explosion in MI6 headquarters, James  Bond takes position as bodyguard to the tycoon's daughter, Elektra (Sophie  Marceau), who has a mysterious past and hidden agenda.In recent weeks,  Brosnan has gone on record saying he wants more revealing and sexier love  scenes in Bond and he would love to see Bond killed off. He has also said  he wouldn't mind leaving Bond behind. Are these the greatest things to be  saying upon the opening of the film?It would be such a shame when he  seems to be playing Bond right and having a script that wants us to see  more Bond.I guess the next question to ask is who or what is Bond? And  why that element makes a good Bond film. A superior Bond film is always in  the script and the intrigue associated with a spy. In the latest film the  script always has two levels going on coupled with a pain within Bond  himself. These play off each other as the perpetual hero shows the signs of  being human. In the past 5 Bond films they have been trying to make him  more human and it really isn't till this one that they seem to have located  the angle they sought. Betrayed, injured, and scorned are just some of the  emotions I haven't seen in Bond in years. And that's exactly why this one  works and why it's the best Bond in ten years.With this revelation,  director Michael Apted's action sequences and locales seem to be fleshed  out and in the highest of Bond form. Apted pushes the envelope with a great  Bond finale which pivots Bond and the villain dueling in a submarine  spiraling towards the bottom of the ocean. This sequence is true Bond and  reminds me a lot of the great climaxes of the 80's pictures.Within the  cast is the always brilliant Sophie Marceau who's innocent but brutal  Elektra is going to be a fondly remembered Bond girl. Wasted is 2nd Bond  girl Denise Richards who seems to be quite out of her element and made me  thinking that these two could be father and daughter instead of lovers.  Richards looks like a teen and is supposed to be a &quot;Lara Croft type  nuclear expert&quot;? Rounding out the rest of the cast is &quot;the man  who can feel no pain&quot; Renard played deviously by Robert Carlyle.  Carlyle reminded me a lot of Sean Bean's 006 in &quot;Goldeneye&quot;.With this entry into the Bond vault I hope Brosnan comes back for at  least two or three more. Connery and Moore did over six each why can't  Brosnan. So here is to the continuation of the franchise.  I hope the DVD  release is every bit as good as the film and the previous Bond DVD  releases.",5,Bond......James Bond,951091200,"02 21, 2000",2000,2719,"['Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'third', 'outing', 'James', 'Bond', 'slew', 'controversy', 'will', 'be', 'last.Feeling', 'responsible', 'death', 'British', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'friend', 'who', 'died', 'explosion', 'MI6', 'headquarters', 'James', 'Bond', 'position', 'bodyguard', 'tycoon', 'daughter', 'Elektra', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'who', 'mysterious', 'past', 'hidden', 'agenda.In', 'recent', 'weeks', 'Brosnan', 'gone', 'record', 'saying', 'more', 'revealing', 'sexier', 'love', 'scenes', 'Bond', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Bond', 'killed', 'off', 'also', 'said', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'leaving', 'Bond', 'behind', 'Are', 'greatest', 'things', 'be', 'saying', 'opening', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'shame', 'when', 'be', 'playing', 'Bond', 'right', 'having', 'script', 'see', 'more', 'Bond.I', 'guess', 'next', 'question', 'ask', 'who', 'what', 'Bond', 'why', 'element', 'good', 'Bond', 'film', 'superior', 'Bond', 'film', 'always', 'script', 'intrigue', 'associated', 'spy', 'latest', 'film', 'script', 'always', 'two', 'levels', 'going', 'coupled', 'pain', 'Bond', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'perpetual', 'hero', 'signs', 'being', 'human', 'past', '5', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'make', 'more', 'human', 'really', ""n't"", 'till', 'one', 'seem', 'have', 'located', 'angle', 'sought', 'Betrayed', 'injured', 'scorned', 'are', 'just', 'emotions', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Bond', 'years', 'exactly', 'why', 'one', 'works', 'why', 'best', 'Bond', 'ten', 'years.With', 'revelation', 'director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'action', 'sequences', 'locales', 'seem', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'highest', 'Bond', 'form', 'Apted', 'envelope', 'great', 'Bond', 'finale', 'Bond', 'villain', 'dueling', 'submarine', 'spiraling', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'sequence', 'true', 'Bond', 'lot', 'great', 'climaxes', '80', 'pictures.Within', 'cast', 'always', 'brilliant', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'who', 'innocent', 'brutal', 'Elektra', 'going', 'be', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Wasted', '2nd', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'who', 'be', 'quite', 'element', 'made', 'thinking', 'two', 'could', 'be', 'father', 'daughter', 'instead', 'lovers', 'Richards', 'teen', 'supposed', 'be', 'quot', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'type', 'nuclear', 'expert', 'quot', 'Rounding', 'out', 'rest', 'cast', 'quot', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'quot', 'Renard', 'played', 'deviously', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Carlyle', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Sean', 'Bean', '006', 'quot', 'Goldeneye', 'quot', 'entry', 'Bond', 'vault', 'hope', 'Brosnan', 'back', 'least', 'two', 'three', 'more', 'Connery', 'Moore', 'did', 'six', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Brosnan', 'So', 'here', 'continuation', 'franchise', 'hope', 'DVD', 'release', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'previous', 'Bond', 'DVD']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

477926,A3FKVJ0SJR2EA0,6305784906,J.C. Correa,"[1, 1]","The World Is Not Enough is a solid entry in the near 40-year-old franchise.  After two decent outings in the role, Pierce Brosnan is finally given a film where he can showcase the numerous qualities which make Bond a  great hero, even today: dry wit, elegant sophistication, and a cold-blooded  lethality which has been absent in the series for a long time.  Brosnan is  secure and confident this time around, and the film does for him what  &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; did for Roger Moore. The film has what is  perhaps the best (and longest) pre-credit sequence in the history of the  series.  It has a fantastic character in Elektra (played with a natural  sensuality by Sophie Marceau).  Most surprisingly, it gives Judy Dench  something more to do than just sit around in her office, briefing Bond  about his latest mission. The film also marks the last appearance of  &quot;Q&quot; (wonderfully played by Desmond Llewellyn for over 35 years),  and passes on the torch to John Cleese in a most humorous fashion.  The  welcome return of Robbie Coltrane as a reoccuring character from  &quot;GoldenEye,&quot; is also one of the film's high points. The film's  greatest strength is perhaps the rare attention to actual drama that the  series has unfortunately been inconsistent with.  The best Bond films (From  Russia With Love, Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Licence To  Kill) have payed close attention to this element, and this one is all the  much better for it. The only disappointing features in the DVD are the  inclusion of only one trailer, and the lack of the Desmond Llewellyn  tribute, which inexplicably, the VHS version includes.  On every other  count, it's a good edition of a very good 007 adventure.",4,The Best Bond In Years!,960163200,"06 5, 2000",2000,1739,"['World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'solid', 'entry', 'near', '40-year-old', 'franchise', 'two', 'decent', 'outings', 'role', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'finally', 'given', 'film', 'where', 'can', 'showcase', 'numerous', 'qualities', 'make', 'Bond', 'great', 'hero', 'even', 'today', 'dry', 'wit', 'elegant', 'sophistication', 'cold-blooded', 'lethality', 'been', 'absent', 'series', 'long', 'time', 'Brosnan', 'secure', 'confident', 'time', 'film', 'what', 'quot', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Loved', 'Me', 'quot', 'did', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'film', 'what', 'perhaps', 'best', 'longest', 'pre-credit', 'sequence', 'history', 'series', 'fantastic', 'character', 'Elektra', 'played', 'natural', 'sensuality', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'Most', 'surprisingly', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'something', 'more', 'do', 'just', 'sit', 'around', 'office', 'briefing', 'Bond', 'latest', 'mission', 'film', 'also', 'last', 'appearance', 'quot', 'Q', 'quot', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Desmond', 'Llewellyn', '35', 'years', 'passes', 'torch', 'John', 'Cleese', 'most', 'humorous', 'fashion', 'welcome', 'return', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'reoccuring', 'character', 'quot', 'GoldenEye', 'quot', 'also', 'one', 'film', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'perhaps', 'rare', 'attention', 'actual', 'drama', 'series', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'inconsistent', 'best', 'Bond', 'films', 'Russia', 'Love', 'Goldfinger', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Licence', 'Kill', 'have', 'payed', 'close', 'attention', 'element', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'only', 'disappointing', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'inclusion', 'only', 'one', 'trailer', 'lack', 'Desmond', 'Llewellyn', 'tribute', 'inexplicably', 'VHS', 'version', 'other', 'count', 'good', 'edition', 'very', 'good', '007', 'adventure']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

A great villain, and what Bond flick would be complete without a tiger shark or two? Sprawling adventure, Awesome set design,  intrigue and megalomania. That's what these films should be about. Tomorrow  Never Dies, although having a weak villain, was cool. It took James into  some cool locations and good stunts. But that isn't what makes a Bond film  REALLY special, it's the feel. One elemant building on another, everything  steering towards a final climax. Personal conflicts, adventurous outcomes  and diabolocal schemes all come together in the end. This movie is a limp  noodle. You don't care about the characters, and although Robert Carlysle  adds an interesting element, it just doesn't gel. The two women are total  bimbos, and the big boat chase had me yawning. How many times has James  been in boat chases? I can't even count them all. I know they're running  out of ideas, but come on fellas, reach for something here. Best Bonds:  Thunderball, Tomorrow Never Dies, Goldeneye, A View to a Kill, Liscense to  Kill.

Being aware of this I still say that the 22nd bond movie made is my third favorite, recentcy being not relavent.The new ""owner"" of the bond enterprise finally keep her politics in check a little bit by just having the writers create strong, interesting and at the same time beautiful female characters to balance and play off of Brosnan's charisma.  M (Bonds female boss) actually was part of the plot this time.  Denise Richards as a 22 year, built and gorgeous nuclear physicist was a stretch, but I smiled and accepted it.  Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) is deliciously powerful, vulnerable and beautiful.  For families there is no cursing with only a suggestion of sex and nudity.  This was to be Desmond Llewelyn's (Q) last bond film, but sadly he died shortly after its release in a car accident, preventing any cameo's that health considerations might have allowed.

477929,A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,6305784906,"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff""","[0, 1]","When I first heard of the rumors that 'Remington Steele' actor Pierce Brosnan was tapped to play James Bond I felt that the series was in for a good dose of adrenaline it had been lacking in for about half of the Roger Moore films.  But the producers of 'Steele' wouldn't let Brosnan out of his contract, and sorry for us Bond fans, but we had to wait an agonizing 2 more films before they got around to FINALLY securing Brosnan.  This is the role he was BORN to play, and 'The World Is Not Enough' stands side-by-side (in MY opinion) with any of the Bond films of old.The opening scene alone is just about the BEST of ALL the Bond films and for that matter pretty much ANY film I have ever seen. Ever hear of Sprint Boats?  Well they are miniature speed boats that can actually turn on a dime and the opening scene is a chase (what else?) on the river Thames in London which raps up at the Millinnium Dome and it'll leave you breathless.  While I had a hard time imagining one of the two leading ladies as an honest-to-goodness nuclear physicist, I STILL managed to find a LOT to enjoy in this, I believe the 19th outing for the super-spy.  Let's be honest: We DON'T see a Bond film hoping to stretch our intellect, now DO we?  We go 'cuz we KNOW we're gonna be in for a visual roller coaster ride with a pinch of adrenaline thrown in for good measure--shaken not stirred, please.

Robert Carlyle is really good as that mad man and is one of the best Bond villians in my book. You also have Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards as two sexy Bond girls. Most Bond fans just mostly picked on the film due to Denise Richards acting abilities. Which are limited. I never had much of a problem with her, I guess I was too busy looking at her and not watching her acting abilities as closely as other Bond fans lol.I do think Brosnan's Bond films did try too hard in casting Bond women though. I mean most of them were too recognizeabke and just casted on looks basically. I think Goldeneye had the best casting though of any of his films. I mean I don't even know what else that Bond girl was in after Goldeneye or before it for that matter and she could act too. I do like the casting of Sophie Marceau here more than the Denise Richards casting though. Not only because she's a better actor but because she doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. I mean I just know her from a bad David Spade film.Anyway I think The World is Not Enough is one of Brosnan's better outings as Bond. It's surely better than Tomorrow Never Dies. Plus I think Robert Carlyle is as memorable as a Bond villian as Sean Bean in GoldenEye. I don't know why people talk about the villian in Die Another Day like he was the best of the Brosnan films, he did nothing for me really.  Brosnan doesn't shine here as much as he does in GoldenEye but I do find his line at the end both crude and funny and he delivers it well.

The banker is about to tell Bond who killed 0012 and took the money when the banker is killed by a thrown knife into the back of his neck.  Bond escapes after several close calls with death and manages to take the money with him.He returns to London and gives the cash to the authorities only to have Sir Robert King killed by the money which was booby trapped. Bond chases the assassin and he discovers that the assassin is the banker's assistant who killed the banker with the knife.  He traps her after a dramatic boat chase in the Thames River but she kills herself and nearly takes Bond with her.Bond is assigned to guard Sir Robert's daughter Electra (Sophie Marceau).  This is because she is linked to the possible murderer of her father as the man had abducted Electra and held her for ransom in the past.  He is a former KGB agent who now works as a terrorist named Renard (Robert Carlyle). Bond Visits her at the site of where the international pipeline is being built and almost immediately has to save her life and his from assassins.....This is a high action Bond thriller like all of them.  It features two beautiful actresses in Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards (as Doctor Christmas Jones) and it makes for a suspenseful plot with an evil madman trying to cause a catastrophe.  With action scenes and stunts while in the air, snow covered mountains, and under water, this movie will keep you interested in seeing the suspenseful ending.

Yes, Dalton is cool as a silk shirt, but somehow, I didn't, uh, bond with him as a Bond. This Bond film is really about the best I've seen so far. It delivers what we all expect from Bond films-action and plenty of it, gadgets, intricate plot, one bad girl and one good Bond girl.The Bond girl here is Denise Richards (Starship Troopers) who works as an unlikely atomic physicist in shorts and tee shirt (think Lara Croft) and has an even more unlikely name ""Christmas Jones."" She is outshone, however, by lovely Sophie Marceau as Electra King, poor little rich girl gone bad.In fact, what makes this film as enjoyable is that the supporting cast is excellent. Lead bad guy Renard is well played by Robert Carlyle, Judy Dench makes an admirable (if somewhat stupid) M, and we get to see Desmond Llewlyn as ""Q"" one last time. The direction by Michael Apted is tight. The film never falters.The stunts are spectacular, including an opening boat chase on the Thames that makes you appreciate the art of stunt filming without the assist of CGI graphics. The predictable helicopter makes its appearance, but with a real twist-dragging some kind of tree-trimming sawblades that do amazing things to buildings.The only quibble I have is that the villain --a man who feels no pain is a ridiculous concept. There are people who feel no pain, and they end up pretty much incapacitated, not to mention that a bullet even brushing the medulla oblongata stops your breathing . Too unbelievable and really, the lack of pain part was not even needed for the script. Dumb.The DVD surround sound quality was distinct.

Sophie Marceau only showed half  of what she is capable of as an actress in this film,as she played the  emotional, psychotic Elektra King. Marceau was convincing, witty, and evil  to the core. Renard is a well developed maniacle character, yet his schemes  seem all too far-fetched, and his love for King is a touch unrealistic. In  my opinion, a character like Jaws or Oddjob would do a whole lot of good  for the more modern Bonds as they seem a bit dry and unimaginative. Where  this movie really lacks, though, is its plot, and...what can I say...Denise  Richards. The plot of TWINE would seriously take a 00 Agent to unravel, as  it started out convincingly enough, yet it became over-twisted, and down  right crazy! Finally, Denise Richards was about the worst actress I have  ever witnessed in a movie. Her lines were lame, her character was dry, and  her romance with James Bond (Brosnan) as Christmas Jones, was short,  displeasing, and dirty. Brosnan did all he could towards the end of this  film to make up for Richards's horrific acting! Of the three modern Bonds,  I would rate them: 1.

477945,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,6305784906,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 0]",The World Is Not Enough released in 1999 directed by Michael Apted who has really just done a lot of TV work & some documenteries. I actually saw this in theater when it came out. This is 1 of the better Bond movies. It stars Pierce Brosnan as James Bond for the 3rd time Judi Dench reprises her role as M. Which she was given a bigger role. Desmond Llewlyn as Q who died after this movie came out. Robert Carlyle as Renard Sophie Marceau as Elecktra King  Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones & Robbie Coltrane returned as Zukovsky. Story is Bond is in Biblo Spain to retrive money for Robert King but he wants to find out the truth about the murder of 0012. The banker is murdered by his assistant Bond escapes arrives in London with the money. King's lepel pin is triggered to arm a bomb it kills King. Then we get a decent boat chase with the assassin she tries to escape in a hot air ballon Bond grabs a hold of a rope tries to reason with her she shoots 1 of the gas tanks kills herself Bond falls a short distance we get a cool opening with a great theme by Garbage. Bond traces the money to a terrorist named Renard who has a bullet in his brain which he feels no pain but the bullet will eventually kill him. M thinks Renard might go after King's daughter Elecktrta because Renard abducted her previously. Elecktra runs her father's oil business now she is building a big pipe line. Elecktra is over seeing it when she is attacked we get a decent action scene while sking it's cool. Bond goes to Valentine Zukovsky's casino to find out if he was behind the attack on Elecktra. He finds out 1 of Eleckta's body gaurds Davidov is working with Renard he goes & kills Davidov poses as him to find out what Renard is up to. In this missle site or whatever were intoduced to Dr. Christmas Jones & she is suspicous of Bond. He finds out Renard is stealing plutonium his cover is blown & we get 1 of the better action scenes. He also finds out that Elecktra might be working with Renard. A bomb has been placed in 1 of the pipelines Bond & Jones go to investigate he fakes there deaths to throw Elecktra off. Elecktra turns on M no suprise you could see it coming 10 milies away. Bond thinks that Zukovsky is working for Elecktra but that's not the case Electra's men are trying to kill him this was a decent acton scene. Basically they find out where Renard's hide out is Madien's Tower in Instanbul Renard is going to use a Nuclar Sub to cause an instant catosphic melt down to take out Russia's oil pipe line. 1 of Zukovsky's henchies turn on him Bond & Christmas Jones are captured. Bond is put in a torture chair it's kind of cool Zukovsky comes in saves him but he is killed in the process he goes & frees M kills Eleckta goes to save Dr. Jones & that's pretty much the movie. The boat chase took 7 weeks to film. The scene with Zukovsk in the pool of caviar was filmed on Robbie Coltrane's birthday. MGM wanted Sharon Stone for the role of Elecktra King. Peter Jackson was considered to direct. The original screener was 160 minutes I do suggest the game on the N64 & PS1. Michael Apted did a decent job directing. Some of the acting is on & off Pirece Brosnan was great again. Judi Dench was good again she figured into the plot more. Sad Desmond Llewlyn never got to play Q again you can't go wrong with Llewlyn & Judi Dench. Robert Carlyle worked fine as the villain. Robbie Coltrane was pretty good. I'm not a fan of Denise Richards but she did a decent job I'd rather watch her than Halle Berry in Die Another Day. Sopie Marceau her character wasn't the best I don't think it was needed honestly but she did good for what she had to do. I think the director & cast all did a good job it has some problems & the plot wasn't the best but it gets the job done. I'd rather watch this over a lot of the Roger Moore Bond movies or Casino Royale yes I'm serious or Die Another Day now that's a bad sequel.,3,Not as good as Golden Eye or Tomorrow Never Dies but not bad 7/10,1291766400,"12 8, 2010",2010,3913,"['World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'released', '1999', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'done', 'lot', 'TV', 'work', 'documenteries', 'actually', 'saw', 'theater', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1', 'better', 'Bond', 'movies', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'James', 'Bond', '3rd', 'time', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'role', 'M.', 'Which', 'was', 'given', 'bigger', 'role', 'Desmond', 'Llewlyn', 'Q', 'who', 'died', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Renard', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'Elecktra', 'King', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'returned', 'Zukovsky', 'Story', 'Bond', 'Biblo', 'Spain', 'retrive', 'money', 'Robert', 'King', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'murder', '0012', 'banker', 'murdered', 'assistant', 'Bond', 'London', 'money', 'King', 'lepel', 'pin', 'triggered', 'arm', 'bomb', 'King', 'Then', 'get', 'decent', 'boat', 'chase', 'assassin', 'escape', 'hot', 'air', 'Bond', 'grabs', 'hold', 'rope', 'reason', 'shoots', '1', 'gas', 'tanks', 'Bond', 'short', 'distance', 'get', 'cool', 'opening', 'great', 'theme', 'Garbage', 'Bond', 'money', 'terrorist', 'named', 'Renard', 'who', 'bullet', 'brain', 'pain', 'bullet', 'will', 'eventually', 'kill', 'M', 'Renard', 'might', 'go', 'King', 'daughter', 'Elecktrta', 'Renard', 'abducted', 'previously', 'Elecktra', 'father', 'oil', 'business', 'now', 'building', 'big', 'pipe', 'line', 'Elecktra', 'seeing', 'when', 'attacked', 'get', 'decent', 'action', 'scene', 'sking', 'cool', 'Bond', 'Valentine', 'Zukovsky', 'casino', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'attack', 'Elecktra', 'out', '1', 'Eleckta', 'body', 'gaurds', 'Davidov', 'working', 'Renard', 'kills', 'Davidov', 'poses', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Renard', 'up', 'missle', 'site', 'were', 'intoduced', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'suspicous', 'Bond', 'out', 'Renard', 'stealing', 'plutonium', 'cover', 'blown', 'get', '1', 'better', 'action', 'scenes', 'also', 'out', 'Elecktra', 'might', 'be', 'working', 'Renard', 'A', 'bomb', 'been', 'placed', '1', 'pipelines', 'Bond', 'Jones', 'go', 'investigate', 'fakes', 'there', 'deaths', 'throw', 'Elecktra', 'off', 'Elecktra', 'M', 'suprise', 'could', 'see', 'coming', '10', 'milies', 'away', 'Bond', 'Zukovsky', 'working', 'Elecktra', 'not', 'case', 'Electra', 'men', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'was', 'decent', 'acton', 'scene', 'Basically', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'Renard', 'hide', 'out', 'Madien', 'Tower', 'Instanbul', 'Renard', 'going', 'use', 'Nuclar', 'Sub', 'cause', 'instant', 'catosphic', 'melt', 'down', 'take', 'out', 'Russia', 'oil', 'pipe', 'line', '1', 'Zukovsky', 'henchies', 'turn', 'Bond', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'are', 'captured', 'Bond', 'put', 'torture', 'chair', 'kind', 'cool', 'Zukovsky', 'saves', 'killed', 'process', 'frees', 'M', 'kills', 'Eleckta', 'save', 'Dr.', 'Jones', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'boat', 'chase', 'took', '7', 'weeks', 'film', 'scene', 'Zukovsk', 'pool', 'caviar', 'was', 'filmed', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'birthday', 'MGM', 'wanted', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'role', 'Elecktra', 'King', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'was', 'considered', 'direct', 'original', 'screener', 'was', '160', 'minutes', 'do', 'suggest', 'game', 'N64', 'PS1', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'directing', 'acting', 'Pirece', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'great', 'again', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'was', 'good', 'again', 'figured', 'plot', 'more', 'Sad', 'Desmond', 'Llewlyn', 'never', 'got', 'play', 'Q', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Llewlyn', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'worked', 'fine', 'villain', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'did', 'decent', 'job', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Die', 'Day', 'Sopie', 'Marceau', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'needed', 'honestly', 'did', 'good', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'think', 'director', 'cast', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'problems', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'job', 'done', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'lot', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Bond', 'movies', 'Casino', 'Royale', ""'m"", 'serious', 'Die', 'Day', 'now', 'bad', 'sequel']",The World Is Not Enough VHS
477946,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,6305784906,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","In 1999, a year that saw big budget special effects extravaganzas such as, ""The Matrix"" and ""Star Wars - Episode 1:  The Phantom Menace"", MGM really had their work cut out for them in bringing the 19th film in the `James Bond' franchise to theaters.  It would have been a simple decision for some movie studios to push back the release of any movie that was expected to do well, in order to get away from the stiff competition so that their movie would have the chance it deserves.  But MGM believed in the `James Bond' franchise so much, that even though it's had sequel after sequel after sequel, and audiences should, by all rights, be completely tired of the character, MGM knew that their latest effort ""007:  The World Is Not Enough"" (quite the mouthful isn't it) was such a solid movie that even going up against such huge blockbusters wouldn't be enough to dent their profit from this franchise.""007:  The World Is Not Enough"" starts off with Agent 007, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) being given the assignment of protecting a very beautiful and seductive oil heiress (Sophie Marceau).  This assignment, as simple as it seems, proves to be rather troublesome for 007, for one this heiress is a close personal friend of M's (Judi Dench), and she possesses a passion for life and love that rivals James Bond's.  To make matters increasingly worse, the reason the heiress needs protection is because of an eco-terrorist known as Renard (Robert Carlyle), who due to a bullet lodged in his brain makes him impervious to any pain, and virtually unstoppable as an enemy.  In his quest to stop Renard, James encounters a lovely, young scientist (Denise Richards) who, unbeknownst to her, just so happens to be working for Renard and his evil cause.  So, it's up to Bond to not only thwart Renard's nefarious schemes, but also protect the young scientist and the heiress.  To some this might seem daunting, to James Bond it's just another day at MI-6.Proving that even after 19 films and 5 different actors playing the title role, this franchise is still in top-form, somehow managing to come back time and time again with fresh, new ideas that continue to thrill audiences.  Pierce Brosnan returning to the role of James Bond for a third time, turns in his strongest performance to date, his range from Bond's love for the ladies to his ruthlessness with the villains is remarkably played by Brosnan.  Robert Carlyle delivers a very sinister, yet somewhat low-key performance as the villainous Renard.  Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards not only vie for the affection of James Bond, but also for the coveted role of favorite Bond girl featured in this movie.  Most Bond films only feature one clear cut Bond girl, but with this film it's evident that one would not suffice, and both win the coveted title in my opinion.  The action scenes are even more fun and elaborate, especially the obligatory jaw-dropping opener that always manages to deliver some new, over-the-top obstacle for Bond to overcome.  If I had one complaint about this movie at all, it would have to be the choice to have the band `Garbage' perform the title song, I am not a fan of `Garbage', and truthfully I believe their name says everything there is to say about their music.  They are definitely a poor choice for the title song in this franchise.With 19 films under his belt, James Bond is still going strong, and this newest installment is definitely one of the strongest in the series.

477953,A7IIPRUAEZ2N6,6305784906,Kendrik Lau,"[2, 3]","The World Is Not Enough is a good Bond film, but I remember having a better time in the theater watching A View To A Kill, a film that everybody seems to to trash but was never able to come up with an adequate reason to back up their claim.TWINE opens up with a 13+ minute pre-title teaser (one of the main complaints I have with Brosnan's Bond is that the teaser is always soooo long) which have Bond in Spain before skipping to London, where Sir Robert King, a close friend of M, got blown uo with exploding money. It then seques onto a spectacular boat chase on the river Thames as Bond chases after the delectable Giulietta da Vinci (aka Cigar Girl), played by Maria Grazia Cucinotta. With pure Bondian logic, the river chase ended up on hotair balloon where Giulietta prefer suicide than to tell our hero who was the one who blew King up.With King gone, Bond is convinced that Victor Zokov, aka Renard the Anarchist, who onced kidnapped King's daughter Elektra, is behind the assassination and is now after the bereaved daughter.The rest of the movie have Bond trying to track down Renard, see what is he really up to, and find out if Elektra is really as innocent as she looks.Overall, this is one of the few Bond films which actually delve deeper into some of the characters. But for every attempt at character development, something else misfires.The scenes between Renard and Elektra are too melodramatic. It is an attempt to make the audience sympathize with the villain, with somehow it just sort of get....gooey, for lack of a better word. You might think that our villain would revel in the fact that he can't feel pain thanks to a bullet in his head. But no.... he bemoaned his fate like a Shakespearean character trapped in the wrong story.While Elektra is well developed, Bond's other interest, Christmas Jones, is woefully underwritten and really does next to nothing. So she can disarm nuclear bombs, ironically in the movie, she didn't disarm a thing. Denise Richards is just not convincing as a nuclear physicist. What they needed was a older, more mature actress in the part.Action wise, TWINE delivers, but there is something about the ski chase that seems tired and repetitive. Perhaps it is David Arnold's lackluster score. As for the caviar factory with the helicopter and the hanging buzzsaws, we have Bond running this way, that way, up and down..... why don't he just get the hell out of there?The title-sequence, which centered around the oil motif started out great...but Daniel Kleinmann, unlike Maurice Binder before him, jam too much into the screen at once and you don't know where to look. Binder before him, have the audience concentrate on one image at a time.Compare to all the dvd of other Bond films,the extra features on the TWINE Dvd is rather sparse. There are some trailers, an interview with Brosnan, and some other extras, like how the title sequence is shot, are included, but have no commentary.Overall, TWINE is a pretty good picture, helped enormously by French actress Sophie Marceau. I just love that sick expression on her face when she took her earring off and reveal to Bond how psycho she can be. Robert Carlyle is okay as Renard, but I would much like it if they cut down on the melodrama. As for Brosnan, he shines as Bond. I hope he would make more.

477956,AHRSDAKFHXEUX,6305784906,kentuckyreader,"[0, 0]","Originally, I was disappointed by this film.  A Bond film usually rushes you along headfirst through the action until you sometimes feel just a little giddy.  I thought the character development with the villains in this film slowed that headlong flight, to its detriment.But in looking at this film a couple more times, I realized something.Michael Apted really has a good way with the action sequences:  once he gets going, he really throws everything at you ... not only the kitchen sink, but even some of the plumbing.  He puts in so much, as a matter of fact, that I experienced some sensory overload in my first viewing.  It was hard to get a sense of the scenes, and so they blurred past me.But now, after a couple more viewings, I have a better sense of the action sequences and of what Bond is doing in them.  Consequently, I really enjoy those scenes a lot, with the exception of the skiing sequence, which was disappointing.Other pluses are that we saw more of the inner workings of MI6 and more scenes with the team backing Bond up.  I love that the series is doing that.  The addition of John Cleese is almost a masterstroke!  (I was sad but glad that &quot;Q&quot; had the opportunity to say one last goodbye ... in a scene that has a subtle surreality about it in that is foreshadows his death.)Brosnan continues to give us that intense, hard, quick and very driven James Bond that he's been giving us since the **awesome** Goldeneye!  And, of course, this movie retains very well the James Bond elegance ... or should I say opulance?  It's difficult not to like an action hero who wears French cuffs!  I wonder if Brosnan gets to keep his wardrobe after filming wraps???I can't help but think that other Bond fans who were slightly let down by this film might enjoy it more after another look ... if only for the great action sequences.  Even though the character development with the villains seemed to pull back a trifle too hard on the plot's reins, this film gets most of the James Bond panache just right!",3,One Viewing Wasn't &quot;Enough&quot; to Catch All the Action!,991440000,"06 2, 2001",2001,2026,"['Originally', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Bond', 'film', 'usually', 'headfirst', 'action', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'just', 'little', 'giddy', 'thought', 'character', 'development', 'villains', 'film', 'slowed', 'headlong', 'flight', 'detriment.But', 'looking', 'film', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'realized', 'something.Michael', 'Apted', 'really', 'good', 'way', 'action', 'sequences', 'once', 'going', 'really', 'everything', 'not', 'only', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'even', 'plumbing', 'so', 'much', 'matter', 'fact', 'experienced', 'sensory', 'overload', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'sense', 'scenes', 'so', 'blurred', 'past', 'me.But', 'now', 'couple', 'more', 'viewings', 'have', 'better', 'sense', 'action', 'sequences', 'what', 'Bond', 'doing', 'Consequently', 'really', 'enjoy', 'scenes', 'lot', 'exception', 'skiing', 'sequence', 'was', 'disappointing.Other', 'pluses', 'are', 'saw', 'more', 'inner', 'workings', 'MI6', 'more', 'scenes', 'team', 'backing', 'Bond', 'up', 'love', 'series', 'doing', 'addition', 'John', 'Cleese', 'almost', 'masterstroke', 'was', 'sad', 'quot', 'Q', 'quot', 'had', 'opportunity', 'say', 'one', 'last', 'goodbye', 'scene', 'subtle', 'surreality', 'death', 'Brosnan', 'give', 'intense', 'hard', 'quick', 'very', 'driven', 'James', 'Bond', 'been', 'giving', '**awesome**', 'Goldeneye', 'course', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'James', 'Bond', 'elegance', 'should', 'say', 'opulance', 'difficult', 'not', 'like', 'action', 'hero', 'who', 'French', 'cuffs', 'wonder', 'Brosnan', 'keep', 'wardrobe', 'filming', 'wraps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'other', 'Bond', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'slightly', 'let', 'down', 'film', 'might', 'enjoy', 'more', 'look', 'only', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'Even', 'character', 'development', 'villains', 'seemed', 'pull', 'back', 'trifle', 'too', 'hard', 'plot', 'reins', 'film', 'most', 'James', 'Bond', 'panache', 'just', 'right']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

A more complex and nuanced story than most recent Bond films, TWINE recaptures a good part of the exotica and international intrigue of the Bond series as first conceived.The precredits sequence sets up the story nicely: Sir Robert King, oil magnate and friend of ""M"" (Judi Dench) is killed by booby trapped money delivered to him by Bond. All roads lead to Rome, the roads being clues, and Rome in this case being represented by Electra King (Sophie Marceau), Sir Robert's beautiful daughter, who was the victim of a recent kidnap plot hatched by the mysterious Renard, a terrorist rendered unable to experience pain by a bullet lodged in his skull.  ""M"" dispatches Bond to protect Electra, who has taken over her father's petroleum empire in central Asia.From the moment he arrives in Azerbaijan, Bond is a hunted man. Although first enamored of Electra, Bond soon realizes that there is something amiss.In TWINE, Brosnan resurrects the dark Bond of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. His dual nemeses, Electra and Renard, are ably played by Marceau and Robert Carlyle, who both bring some surprising depth to their characters. Electra is particularly sympathetic, being both the brainwashed victim and willing accomplice of Renard. She is by turns sexual and ingenuous, vulnerable and implacable. Marceau is breathtakingly beautiful.Carlyle's Renard, trapped in a body that can't feel, exudes both pathos and hatred as he plots the destruction of the democracies.Dench's ""M"" plays a central role in the film, far larger than any ""M"" before her. The film is notable for being the last appearance as Desmond Llwellyn as ""Q"". Llewellyn, who played ""Q"" in almost every Bond film after 1964, died in a car wreck just days before the theatrical release of the picture, and John Cleese was cleverly edited into the film as his replacement, ""R"".Denise Richards has the weakest major role, playing Dr. Christmas Jones, a nuclear physicist. Richards could have been left on the cutting room floor in her entirety. More's the pity, because Richards is a strikingly beautiful woman who is entirely upstaged by the exotic, erotic Marceau.

Ross ""Kristy""","[1, 1]","Bond number 19 is a solid, if sometimes unspectacular entry into the franchise, brought to the screen by director Michael Apted (Extreme Measures, Enigma).Bond is indeed back, and Pierce Brosnan proves to once again be the best, and fits better in the role making his performance more controlled than in Goldeneye. Along for the ride are Denise Richards (Wild Things), and Sophie Marceau, who provide ample eye candy...The story for the film is the biggest problem. Over-complicated and contrived, it at least provides some good action scenes. However, apart from the excellent pre-credits opening scene the action and stunts feel laboured and sometimes un-involving.But it's a good addition and certainly an improvement on the lacklustre Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). The DVD, like all the Bond releases is fantastic, with great picture and sound quality and tons of extras. With Brosnan, the series is assured to be more popular than ever.

477963,A16X61RLY1YJL7,6305784906,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[8, 11]","For me, this was one of those films where first impressions weren't exactly the best ones as when this film was released there was a great deal of hype about it and I certainly remember being excited about it but the reality of it at the theater didn't ring true.  My opinion of its theatrical release had even been so poor as to not even purchase the DVD when it was released.  A recently rekindled interest in the Bond films brought me to the decision to give this film one more chance which also leads one to the market place sellers as the DVD is no longer in production unless you wish to buy one of the entire boxed sets to get this film.Upon viewing &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot; the second time I would definitely have to say that I was overly critical of its theatrical release.  Taken as a whole, this third Bond film with Pierce Brosnan as James Bond is a pretty good film.  The basic premise is a bit weaker than the other three Bond films starring Brosnan but of course, the films producers overcome that with some spectacular action sequences and scenery.Performance wise, Pierce Brosnan does Bond extraordinarily well in this, his third appearance.  At this point in time, who else could play Bond, probably nobody as he's made the part entirely his and we, the fans, are the better for it.  One of the greatest treats in this Bond film, as with all Bond films is some new Bond babes and as even more special treat this film stars the extraordinarily beautiful French actress Sophie Marceau who may be best known by American audiences for her role in &quot;Braveheart.&quot;  Her performance for this film is pretty much perfect to the role, which is &quot;over the top,&quot; as she takes her character from one end of the extreme to the other.  We're also treated to Denise Richards as a Bond babe in this film and she does a great job with her role although it isn't as quite as over the top as one would expect of her based on previous roles she's taken.&quot;The World is Not Enough&quot; is also quite unfortunately the last appearance by Desmond Llewelyn in role of Q prior to his passing.  &quot;Die Another Day&quot; just didn't seem right without his appearance in the film.  As the &quot;show must go on,&quot; the producers brought in his replacement in John Cleese of &quot;Monty Python&quot; fame in the role of R which is Q's assistant and his character is different but an acceptable replacement.Director Michael Apted does a very good job with this film considering the script.  He may be best known for films such as &quot;Nell&quot; and &quot;Coal Miner's Daughter&quot; but his contribution to Bond series is a respectable one.The Premise:Our erstwhile hero finds himself once again amidst a series of plot twists and action sequences as he's been assigned to protect Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) and at the same time discovers a post cold war disaster involving Russian equipment to include tactical nuclear weapons, all along the way in attempting to find Renard (Robert Carlyle) who was supposed to have been eliminated by another &quot;00&quot; agent but that agent only succeeded in making a stronger monster.  What follows from there is a fairly decent Bond film that covers a majority of the spectrum that is normally covered in a Bond film as we find Pierce Brosnan's version of Bond becoming a bit darker and harsher...  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Audio Commentary with Director Michael Apted-Audio Commentary with Production Designer Peter Lamont, Second Unit Director Vic Armstrong and Composer David Arnold-&quot;The Making of The World is Not Enough,&quot; Documentary-The Secrets of 007:  Featuring Alternate Video Options-Music Video by Garbage-Original Theatrical Trailer-Collectible Booklet",4,007 James Bond The World is Not Enough - A decent Bond film!,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,3752,"['was', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'first', 'impressions', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'best', 'ones', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'hype', 'certainly', 'remember', 'being', 'excited', 'reality', 'theater', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'opinion', 'theatrical', 'release', 'had', 'even', 'been', 'so', 'poor', 'not', 'even', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'recently', 'rekindled', 'interest', 'Bond', 'films', 'brought', 'decision', 'give', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'also', 'one', 'market', 'place', 'sellers', 'DVD', 'longer', 'production', 'wish', 'buy', 'one', 'entire', 'boxed', 'sets', 'get', 'film.Upon', 'viewing', 'quot', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'quot', 'second', 'time', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'overly', 'critical', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Taken', 'whole', 'third', 'Bond', 'film', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'James', 'Bond', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'basic', 'premise', 'bit', 'weaker', 'other', 'three', 'Bond', 'films', 'starring', 'Brosnan', 'course', 'films', 'producers', 'overcome', 'spectacular', 'action', 'sequences', 'scenery.Performance', 'wise', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Bond', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'third', 'appearance', 'point', 'time', 'who', 'else', 'could', 'play', 'Bond', 'probably', 'nobody', 'made', 'part', 'entirely', 'fans', 'are', 'better', 'One', 'greatest', 'treats', 'Bond', 'film', 'Bond', 'films', 'new', 'Bond', 'babes', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'treat', 'film', 'extraordinarily', 'beautiful', 'French', 'actress', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'known', 'American', 'audiences', 'role', 'quot', 'Braveheart.', 'quot', 'performance', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'perfect', 'role', 'quot', 'top', 'quot', 'character', 'one', 'end', 'extreme', 'other', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Bond', 'babe', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'role', ""n't"", 'as', 'quite', 'top', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'based', 'previous', 'roles', 'taken.', 'quot', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'quot', 'also', 'quite', 'unfortunately', 'last', 'appearance', 'Desmond', 'Llewelyn', 'role', 'Q', 'prior', 'passing', 'quot', 'Die', 'Day', 'quot', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'appearance', 'film', 'quot', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'quot', 'producers', 'brought', 'replacement', 'John', 'Cleese', 'quot', 'Monty', 'Python', 'quot', 'fame', 'role', 'R', 'Q', 'assistant', 'character', 'different', 'acceptable', 'replacement.Director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'considering', 'script', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'known', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Nell', 'quot', 'quot', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'quot', 'contribution', 'Bond', 'series', 'respectable', 'one.The', 'Premise', 'erstwhile', 'hero', 'once', 'again', 'amidst', 'series', 'plot', 'twists', 'action', 'sequences', 'been', 'assigned', 'protect', 'Elektra', 'King', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'same', 'time', 'post', 'cold', 'war', 'disaster', 'involving', 'Russian', 'equipment', 'include', 'tactical', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'all', 'way', 'attempting', 'find', 'Renard', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'eliminated', 'quot', '00', 'quot', 'agent', 'agent', 'only', 'succeeded', 'making', 'stronger', 'monster', 'What', 'fairly', 'decent', 'Bond', 'film', 'majority', 'spectrum', 'normally', 'covered', 'Bond', 'film', 'find', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'version', 'Bond', 'becoming', 'bit', 'darker', 'harsher', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Audio', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Apted-Audio', 'Commentary', 'Production', 'Designer', 'Peter', 'Lamont', 'Second', 'Unit', 'Director', 'Vic', 'Armstrong', 'Composer', 'David', 'Arnold-', 'quot', 'Making', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'quot', 'Documentary-The', 'Secrets', '007', 'Featuring', 'Alternate', 'Video', 'Options-Music', 'Video', 'Garbage-Original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer-Collectible', 'Booklet']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

477967,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6305784906,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 4]","Pierce Brosnan returned in 1999 for his third appearance as James Bond in the 19th official Bond film. Brosnan was excellent as Bond in ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" and he was pretty good in this movie, but it seemed to me that churning out three movies in less than six years was causing a little fraying around the edges. This movie is just not as good as ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and perhaps not even as good as ""Goldeneye.""This Bond film begins just as Bond films always do, with Bond attempting to save someone. This time he has become involved in trying to rescue Elektra King (the stunningly beautiful Sophie Marceau). While Bond does not rescue Elektra (who soon after frees herself), Bond does recover the ransom money. It probably would have been better if Bond had not rescued the ransom money because it makes a big hole in MI-6's headquarters. An assassin nearly kills Bond, who then goes chasing the assassin about in Q's nicely appointed fishing boat. When I say nicely appointed, I mean rocket boost, torpedoes, a submarine mode, and a computer that has a cool mapping feature.Once Bond stops chasing the assassin he learns that Elektra King is being threatened by a terrorist, along with her family's oil pipeline. At least, that is what appears to be the situation. Bond soon encounters danger as he tries to protect Elektra from terrorists. Bond encounters even more danger when he discovers that the terrorists plan to steal a nuclear weapon from Russia. While in Russia, Bond meets Christmas Jones (played by Denise Richards - their meeting generates one of the best jokes in the movie). The nuclear bomb soon shows up in the King pipeline. But wait, there's more! Some of the nuclear material is missing from the bomb (I will let the viewer discover how Bond learns that little tidbit). Bond is forced to learn what happened to the remaining nuclear material. During Bond's search for the remaining material he encounters one of the most nefarious weapons yet seen in a Bond film, a helicopter with a series of cutting blades that is supposed to be used for trimming trees.The plot thickens and builds until a final encounter with terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle) aboard a Russian submarine that is well on its way to going kaboom, which will ultimately contaminate a goodly portion of the Mediterranean.This special edition DVD also includes a wealth of extras, including a music video of the theme song by Garbage, a couple of audio tracks, a making of documentary, and alternate video that shows how certain scenes were filmed. That extra was one of my favorites. The audio commentary by Michael Apted was somewhat lackluster, but the audio commentary by Peter Lamont (production designer), Vic Armstrong (second unit director) and David Arnold (composer) was good.This Bond movie is not one of my favorites. While there are portions that I think are outstanding (specifically, the opening boat chase, the chase scene in the mountains, the helicopters with the tree trimming blades, and the scenes involving Q and John Cleese as R), this movie seems to have much less creativity overall than the previous few Bond movies. I am unable to fault Pierce Brosnan, who does very well. Perhaps after churning out two Bond movies in the previous four years the level of creativity was running low. I have to balance my comments a little by the six awards this movie won and the eight awards this movie was nominated for. However, one award and one nomination were for Razzie awards for Worst Supporting Actress (Denise Richards, who won) and Worst Screen Couple (Brosnan and Richards, but no winner this time).In spite of the weakness of this movie, it did well in the box office, setting a new record for the opening weekend of a Bond film, and grossing more than any previous Bond movie. The main reason is that there is no such thing as a bad Bond film. There may be weak Bond films, but they are all watchable. The only question is how often you would like to watch them again.This film does mark the passing of an era. Desmond Llewelyn passed away shortly after this film was released in the United States. We will forever miss Desmond and his explanations of his gadgets. While it is said that anyone can be replaced, the question that is usually not asked is how well they can be replaced. There was only one Desmond Llewelyn and while someone may take his function in the movies, they will not replace Desmond in our hearts.I have this Bond film because it is a Bond film. Admittedly weaker than average, it remains one of the series and I have watched this one several times, and I will watch it again. Sometimes having all the movies in a series is more important than just having the best.",4,Running on Cruise Control,1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,4709,"['Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'returned', '1999',

With The World Is Not Enough, however, everything  comes together. Pierce Brosnan delivers another excellent performance as  James Bond, by now second only to Sean Connery himself.

Garbage  provides one of the greatest Bond theme songs ever, and Michael Apted  brings it all together almost perfectly. Not everything is perfect of  course; the action sequences near the end are somewhat chaotic, John Cleese  is hard to swallow as R, and Sophie Marceau's near perfect physical and  dramatic performance leaves Denise Richards looking foolish.

This is one of my favorite opening sequences for the way it establishes the storyline and offers up the perfect mix of action payoff and cliffhanger before the opening titles actually kick in. Plus, the title song is performed by Garbage, fronted by Scottish singing powerhouse Shirley Manson. She lends just enough rock with power ballad tinges to make a Bond song modern, yet classic. This film also employs a particularly fine cast not the least of which is a the authentic Bond ingredient: Desmond Llewellyn as Q-branch's chief of tech trickery in his last role before tragically being killed in a motor accident. Coincidentally, this film introduces a less paternal guru of gadgets, the all-thumbs 'R' (really a nickname, since Q is the shortening of Quartermaster Branch, and major Boothroyd is ""Q""'s actual character name.) As if that weren't enough star power, a few others on the list of classy Brit talent: Michael Kitchen, Robbie Coltrane, Colin Slmon and Judi Dench. Rounding it out is a love interest that can really act: Sophie Marceau, famously from Braveheart.

477977,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305784906,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","Bond. James Bond. Those three words are known around the globe. They conjure up more than a series of movies dating back to 1962. They make us feel at home. Once again we are invited to spend a couple of hours with an old friend whom many of us have known all of our lives. Naturally, all meetings with a friend are not equally memorable, and The World is not Enough is not the greatest of our visits with agent 007. Still, it is better than a lot of them, and it's always nice to see Mr. Bond. Perhaps he can by now be viewed as the ultimate Peter Pan, and if that is true, then certainly he is also the most charming.The world has changed in the nearly forty years Bond has been around. The Cold War is long over, so the creative team behind The World is not Enough brought back two of the movies' longest running villains - the mad anarchist and the insanely greedy capitalist. In a fairly ingenious twist, they have managed to make these two diametrically opposed forces allies through, of all things, love. I won't say more about this for fear of spoiling the plot. This element does give the movie more interesting plot twists than the last couple of Bond efforts. There is also, for once, an attempt to keep the audience guessing about one character's true intentions.There are several things that are givens in any 007 movie. James will have lots of new toys to play with. There will be a beautiful and forceful woman whom Bond will conquer, yet there will be lingering doubts at the end as to who conquered who. Q will never laugh at one of his jokes. M will never acknowledge to him that he is the best spy in the world. James will always beat the bad guys because none of them can shoot straight even though their lives depend on it.I personally like Pierce Brosnan as 007, although he wins in my eyes by default, since no one will ever top the original Bond, Sean Connery. Judi Dench as M and Desmond as Q are more than satisfactory. John Cleese plays a new character called R, who is Q's future replacement, and this addition provides for several comic moments.There are also great performances by two excellent actors, Robert Carlyle and Sophie Marceau. Carlyle, a star in his native Great Britain, is the dreaded terrorist Renaud, who is more than happy to wipe out a major city with an atomic bomb just to prove a point. Marceau is Elektra King, the daughter of a billionaire oil tycoon. Electra was once held for ransom by Renaud, and when her father is assassinated by a terrorist group, she turns to the British secret service for help. Naturally, Renaud is the group's leader. There is one fly in the acting ointment. Denise Richards turns in a dreadful performance as a nuclear scientist named Dr. Christmas Jones. Ms. Richards was very good in a thriller called Wild Things, and her career survived her being cast in the abysmal Starship Troopers. Whether it can survive this role remains to be seen.Rated PG-13. Not much here that will harm the kids. I should point out that 007 is not quite the gentleman he was 30 to 40 years ago. Back then he would never have shot an unarmed assailant, no matter how dastardly the person was. The modern Bond has become rather pragmatic about these things.",4,Forty years of Bond are not enough,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,3216,"['Bond', 'James', 'Bond', 'three', 'words', 'are', 'known', 'globe', 'conjure', 'up', 'more', 'series', 'movies', 'dating', 'back', '1962', 'make', 'feel', 'home', 'Once', 'again', 'are', 'invited', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'old', 'friend', 'whom', 'many', 'have', 'known', 'lives', 'Naturally', 'meetings', 'friend', 'are', 'not', 'equally', 'memorable', 'World', 'not', 'Enough', 'not', 'greatest', 'visits', 'agent', '007', 'Still', 'better', 'lot', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Mr', 'Bond', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'viewed', 'ultimate', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'true', 'then', 'certainly', 'also', 'most', 'charming.The', 'world', 'changed', 'nearly', 'forty', 'years', 'Bond', 'been', 'around', 'Cold', 'War', 'long', 'over', 'creative', 'team', 'World', 'not', 'Enough', 'brought', 'back', 'two', 'movies', 'longest', 'running', 'villains', 'mad', 'anarchist', 'insanely', 'greedy', 'capitalist', 'fairly', 'ingenious', 'twist', 'have', 'managed', 'make', 'two', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'forces', 'allies', 'things', 'love', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'fear', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'element', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'last', 'couple', 'Bond', 'efforts', 'also', 'once', 'attempt', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'one', 'character', 'true', 'intentions.There', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'are', 'givens', '007', 'movie', 'James', 'will', 'have', 'lots', 'new', 'toys', 'play', 'will', 'be', 'beautiful', 'forceful', 'woman', 'whom', 'Bond', 'will', 'conquer', 'will', 'be', 'lingering', 'doubts', 'end', 'who', 'conquered', 'who', 'Q', 'will', 'never', 'laugh', 'one', 'jokes', 'M', 'will', 'never', 'acknowledge', 'best', 'spy', 'world', 'James', 'will', 'always', 'beat', 'bad', 'guys', 'none', 'can', 'shoot', 'straight', 'even', 'lives', 'depend', 'it.I', 'personally', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', '007', 'eyes', 'default', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'top', 'original', 'Bond', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'M', 'Desmond', 'Q', 'are', 'more', 'satisfactory', 'John', 'Cleese', 'new', 'character', 'called', 'R', 'who', 'Q', 'future', 'replacement', 'addition', 'several', 'comic', 'moments.There', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'performances', 'two', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'Carlyle', 'star', 'native', 'Great', 'Britain', 'dreaded', 'terrorist', 'Renaud', 'who', 'more', 'happy', 'wipe', 'out', 'major', 'city', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'just', 'prove', 'point', 'Marceau', 'Elektra', 'King', 'daughter', 'billionaire', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'Electra', 'was', 'once', 'held', 'ransom', 'Renaud', 'when', 'father', 'assassinated', 'terrorist', 'group', 'British', 'secret', 'service', 'help', 'Naturally', 'Renaud', 'group', 'leader', 'one', 'fly', 'acting', 'ointment', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'dreadful', 'performance', 'nuclear', 'scientist', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'Ms.', 'Richards', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'thriller', 'called', 'Wild', 'Things', 'career', 'survived', 'being', 'cast', 'abysmal', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'can', 'survive', 'role', 'be', 'seen.Rated', 'PG-13', 'Not', 'much', 'here', 'will', 'harm', 'kids', 'should', 'point', 'out', '007', 'not', 'quite', 'gentleman', 'was', '30', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'Back', 'then', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'shot', 'unarmed', 'assailant', 'matter', 'how', 'dastardly', 'person', 'was', 'modern', 'Bond', 'become', 'rather', 'pragmatic', 'things']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Of Brosnan's efforts this is clearly his best, for he has now settled comfortably into the role, has fun with it, yet at the same time manages to give Bond a darker, grittier side which contrasts with the Playboy demeanour Moore gave the character. For Brosnan acting as playboy is merely a means to an end, and the grittier aspect Brosnan portrays is acknowledgement of this.The realism in The World is not Enough leaves Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies in the boy's league, while it strongly marches into a more muscular league. This film was billed as the movie where Bond grows up, and it certainly lives up to it.Denise Richards is perhaps the biggest drawback of the film, not truly suitable for playing a cerebral character. Carlyle, while adequately portraying the villian Renard, just lacked enough on-screen presence to truly make him menacing. Also, the movie tries to cash in on the Oscar successes of Dame Judi Dench by giving her more screen time, and while her acting is flawless, the way she is written further into the story is somewhat contrite. This is easily tolerable since she is such a wonderful actor to watch.The movie relies moreso on character interaction and not over-the-top action sequences or typical Bond glib remarks.

Sadly, the film turned out to be the last for Desmond  Llywellen as Q - the film also introduces Q's understudy, R, played by John  Cleese.The film's score also brings back the lush sweep that made John  Barry's scores such a big part of the Bond mystique.Normally the  prologue introduces the premise and/or a major character.  Here, though,  the prologue begins the actual story in earnest, as the recovery of ransom  money by James turns into a deadly trap for billionaire oil magnate Robert  King.  When MI6 HQ is thus destroyed, James chases a woman assigned to  finish the job, and is injured when she blows herself up rather than  surrender.MI6 quickly deduces that it is the work of terrorist Renard  (Robert Carlyle), a killer with a bullet lodged in his brain severing his  ability to feel pain, which thus makes him physically stronger and more  dangerous.  James must protect Robert King's daughter Elecktra (Sophie  Marceau, who smolders throughout the film like no Bond girl before since  You Only Live Twice's Number 11), and this reunites him with old nemesis  Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltraine).  The return of Valentin is welcome,  and the interplay between James and Valentin is outstanding, particularly  when James corners Valentin at gunpoint later in the film.Through  Valentin James learns of Renard's hideout, an abandoned Soviet ICBM site  whose dismantling is supervised by shapely scientist Christmas Jones  (Denise Richards in a mixed-bag performance).  But there Renard manages to  escape, and in the process James begins to suspect he is being  doublecrossed.  His suspicions prove true when Renard plants a motorized  nuclear bomb in a pipeline near the Caspian Sea.  James and Christmas  succeed in disarming the nuclear portion of the bomb, but James has the  rest of the explosive go off, thus faking their deaths.  This allows him to  interrogate Valentin and learn the shocking truth about Renard and an  inside man on his side.The action comes faster and fiercer than usual  throughout, and the characterization throughout is unusually good.",4,Bond Goes Through The Wringer In Battle With Terrorist,961977600,"06 26, 2000",2000,2439,"['World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'substantial', 'improvement', 'disappointing', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'bringing', 'back', 'personal', 'score-settling', 'aspect', 'made', 'Goldeneye', 'breakthrough', 'Bond', 'saga.By', 'now', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'company', 'have', 'come', 'own', 'roles', 'greater', 'polish', 'shown', 'performances', 'Sadly', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'last', 'Desmond', 'Llywellen', 'Q', 'film', 'also', 'Q', 'understudy', 'R', 'played', 'John', 'Cleese.The', 'film', 'score', 'also', 'back', 'lush', 'sweep', 'made', 'John', 'Barry', 'scores', 'big', 'part', 'Bond', 'mystique.Normally', 'prologue', 'premise', 'major', 'character', 'Here', 'though', 'prologue', 'actual', 'story', 'earnest', 'recovery', 'ransom', 'money', 'James', 'deadly', 'trap', 'billionaire', 'oil', 'magnate', 'Robert', 'King', 'When', 'MI6', 'HQ', 'thus', 'destroyed', 'James', 'woman', 'assigned', 'finish', 'job', 'injured', 'when', 'up', 'rather', 'surrender.MI6', 'quickly', 'deduces', 'work', 'terrorist', 'Renard', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'killer', 'bullet', 'lodged', 'brain', 'severing', 'ability', 'feel', 'pain', 'thus', 'physically', 'stronger', 'more', 'dangerous', 'James', 'must', 'protect', 'Robert', 'King', 'daughter', 'Elecktra', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'who', 'film', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Only', 'Live', 'Twice', 'Number', '11', 'old', 'nemesis', 'Valentin', 'Zukovsky', 'Robbie', 'Coltraine', 'return', 'Valentin', 'welcome', 'interplay', 'James', 'Valentin', 'outstanding', 'particularly', 'when', 'James', 'Valentin', 'gunpoint', 'later', 'film.Through', 'Valentin', 'James', 'Renard', 'hideout', 'abandoned', 'Soviet', 'ICBM', 'site', 'dismantling', 'supervised', 'shapely', 'scientist', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'mixed-bag', 'performance', 'there', 'Renard', 'escape', 'process', 'James', 'suspect', 'being', 'doublecrossed', 'suspicions', 'prove', 'true', 'when', 'Renard', 'plants', 'motorized', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'pipeline', 'Caspian', 'Sea', 'James', 'Christmas', 'succeed', 'disarming', 'nuclear', 'portion', 'bomb', 'James', 'rest', 'explosive', 'go', 'off', 'thus', 'faking', 'deaths', 'interrogate', 'Valentin', 'learn', 'shocking', 'truth', 'Renard', 'inside', 'man', 'side.The', 'action', 'faster', 'fiercer', 'usual', 'characterization', 'unusually', 'good']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

The plot is interesting and involving. The writers  did a good job of getting some of the other characters major roles (M,  Valintin, and so on). I think it was a nice touch to involve M in the film  more than usual.The opening scene is awesome and original, and from  there we're treated to everything you would expect from a Bond film;  intrigue, wit, gambling, and sexy Bond girls.Only two complaints:1.  Although Denise Richards is physically attractive, her acting belongs on  late-night Cinemax movies.  I can't believe how bad she is!2.

Once again, we get solid action, this time from new director Michael Apted, who shows us a rousing airboat chase in the siberian mountains and Bond and one of his new squeezes racing down an oil pipe to outrun a bomb ready to blow them to noting than ashes.  It all seems formulaic, but who the hell cares?  Pierce bronsnan is the best Bond since Sean Connery and they are enough plot twists and surprises to keep it all going.  One thing I especially like about this film, is the way they go back to Goldeneye and reprise the role of Valentine.  With all other Bond films, they seem to forget the last film and just go on; so that was a nice touch.One last reason why I consider this one of the better Bond films, is because they show a scenario that really could happen. Oil is getting more scarce nowadays and people may exploit that to make boatloads of cash for themselves, which is what the villians do here.

477990,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,6305784906,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[5, 8]","Pierce Brosnan is proving more and more to be a most impressive James Bond.  In this, his third outing, Brosnan gives us a little more insight into who Bond is as well as how he is able to keep it all together.  The opening sequence, which is the longest in Bond history, really sets the tone well for the film, with a wonderful boat chase thrown in (Bond fixing his tie as he goes underwater is a gem).But a truly great Bond movie requires good supporting acting as well, and this film has just that, minus one...that of Denise Richards who plays Dr. Christmas Jones (Dr.????).  If she's suppose to be a Nuclear Physicist then I'm a Rocket Scientist.  With an obnoxious personality that just screams &quot;Kill me quickly&quot;, the only two things Richards is good for is &quot;Eye Candy&quot; and getting the younger generation to want to see this movie, which is why she was hired in the first place.  She's almost half Brosnan's age for crying out loud!Well, as bad as Richards is, French Actress, Sophie Marceau is completely breathtaking as Elektra King.  Her performance is simply incredible, keeping you glued to the picture for all the right reasons.  As she showed American audiences in her U.S. debut with &quot;Braveheart&quot;, Sophie evokes a vulnerability that leaves you breathless.  Her strength, determination and cunning instinct, as well as her catlike prowess in this movie give 007 a run for his money.  Finally, a Bond Woman who can take on 007 intelectually and still win out.Robert Carlyle, as many know from his performance in &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, gives a quite unique performance as the villanous, Renard.  I know many critics were quite mixed on their opinion of his performance.  I must go with the positives.  In Bond films we always get these larger than life, truly evil bad guys bent on mass destruction and/or ruling the world.  What a nice change of pace it is to take this formula and add another element to it by making Renard already slowly dying from a bullet wound to the head that is making it's way further and further towards the center of his brain, thereby making him impervious to pain.  One of Carlyle's best scenes is when he's in bed with Elektra (Marceau) and we see this very vulnerable and touching exchange between them, something you never see with Bond villains, giving more dimension to the character.Other noteworthy performances are of course, Dame Judi Dench as M, who this time, for a change, finds herself in the field as a prisoner which adds a nice new element.  Robbie Coltrane, who we all should remember from &quot;Goldeneye&quot; reprises his role as Valentin Zukovsky with the same wonderful wit he showed us before.  Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny still gives us that unique sense of being repulsed by Bond while at the same time admiring him just the same.  And of course, the late, great, Desmond Llewelyn, who played gadget master Q since 1963s From Russia With Love and retires the part in this film to Monty Python alum, John Cleese, who is referred to in the film as R.The plot, in case you don't already know, involves the oil pipes owned by Elektra King, with Renard planning to destroy rival pipes, making hers the only ones available and in the process allowing them both complete control over the oil distribution in the far east.David Arnold is still in grand form scoring his second Bond movie, with some original touches added but not holding back from the classic themes we've come to love and appreciate.  But the title song, performed by Garbage feels a bit under par when presented here.  It sort of feels like it drags on too much with not enough passion by lead vocalist, Shirley Manson, compared to previous title vocalist, Sheryl Crowe, who's amazing work on &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; is truly inspiring (and I'm not even a fan of hers).  I felt the DVD extras for this Bond Special Edition were a bit light, compared to others.  You do get 2 audio commentaries, the first by Director Michael Apted and the second by Production Designer Peter Lamont, Second Unit Director Vic Armstrong and Composer David Arnold (the 2nd being the most entertaining for me).  There's, of course, a &quot;making of&quot; featurette included but it's over much to soon, leaving you stirred, instead of shakin'.The Garbage music video is included, but it is very bizarre.  Apparantly, Shirley Manson plays a cyborg being created in a lab to eventually go and kill the real Shirley Manson and blow up a theater full of people where the band is playing.  The opticals are cool, I must admit, while we see Shirley singing while the scientists are working on building her body.  Quite creative.  I just don't understand what it has to do with the movie other than a unique interpretation of the Elektra King character.  Strange, but still worth a look.I was also disappointed that you only get the original Theatrical Trailer and not the Teaser Trailer on this DVD.  Where many of the Bond discs include many trailers and TV spots, you'd think the newest Bond films would find it much easier to include theirs, considering they just came out.The only other bonus on the disc is &quot;The Secrets Of 007 Revealed&quot; an interesting and unique extra that was first used for The Matrix DVD.  When selecting this feature, you watch the film normally until you see the 007 logo appear at the bottom right of your TV screen, then you push the &quot;Enter&quot; button on your remote control.  The film stops and you now begin to view some wonderful behind the scenes footage of the action scene you were just watching.  It's a fun feature (you can also view the behind the scenes without watching the film too), I just wish there were more of them.  Still, a nice treat.In conclusion, yes, Denise Richards does hurt the movie, somewhat, with her spoiled brat-like attitude, but with plenty of action, nonstop thrills and excitement, The World Is Not Enough still reminds us why we love James Bond, 007!",4,"Great Movie, Minus Denise Richards",974592000,"11 19, 2000",2000,5981,"['Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'proving', 'more', 'more', 'be', 'most',

First, the story is serious and dark, but filled with  built-in action set pieces that mostly  (except for the parachute snowmobiles) fit right in and don't seem too  contrived. I was especially imressed that the finale wasn't a routine  shootout in the villian's secret fortress.  Second, the villians are  tragic and developed rather than the usual egomaniacal billionaire. They  are carefully written and add much to the depth of the film.  Third, there  are several supporting roles that are well-played and written, especially  Dame Judy Dench as M. The plucky Christmas Jones character is fun, and adds  a nice contrast to the silky Electra King.  Do I need to mention that  Pierce Brosnan is an excellent Bond? He really embodies Bond's  essence-sauve, sexy, and very dangerous.  Finally, the film is  beautifully shot and directed. Too many of the 70's and 80's Bonds looked  they were directed by committee.

The earlier Bond films, up to and including Licence to Kill, didn't just rely on special effects, explosions and lots of gunfire: they had plots, and they told a story clearly. (They also had attractive, sexy women.) Decay started with Goldeneye, perhaps because Albert Broccoli was no longer involved in production, and by the time we come to 'The World is Not Enough', the emphasis is clearly on explosions, flames, gunfire, and destruction. There is a story, which you can just about follow; but telling the story takes a back seat to filling the air with bullets, and surrounding Bond with the kind of flame-filled explosion popularized by the 1991 movie 'Backdraft'. Of course, in some of the earlier movies, Bond was occasionally near enough to explosions to be put out of action - he had some implausible escapes; but in 'The World is Not Enough' there is no attempt at realism. Every few minutes Bond walks, runs, or jumps out of explosions that would have reduced him to charred scraps.Brosnan does his best, and he's a good actor, but good acting is wasted in a movie like this; he's literally outgunned; the real stars are the bangs, flames and gunfire. If that's what you like, you'll like this movie.Bond's close encounters with the uniformly unattractive female characters aren't sexy, erotic, or romantic: they're just embarrassing.

478000,A2JHAY08NJ5V7O,6305784906,"""nytnd83""","[2, 2]","The World is Not Enough is probably the best James Bond movie since 1977's  The Spy Who Loved Me.  It has the best action scenes (the opening sequence  is the best by far in the series), the best girl (Sophie Marceau, NOT  Denise Richards), and the best villain (an impervious-to-pain adversary).The first forty-five minutes of the film are completely original  (something that has diminished from the 007 franchise).  In fact, it's the  smartest 007 to date, finally using the special effects and actually using  some wit to make the villain interesting.  Afterwards though, right at the  start of the ski-chase scene, we see the same old stuff from the Spy Who  Loved Me, A View to a Kill, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, etc. and the  finale aboard a submarine, reminiscent of the Spy Who Loved Me, Tomorrow  Never Dies and a few scenes in For Your Eyes Only.  Nonetheless, what a  refreshing feeling it is to see Brosnan enjoying himself as Bond.  This is,  like I said, the best 007 film in over twenty years, and I am betting it is  because of this guy--the best Bond since Connery.Sophie Marceau is  extremely impressive as the heiress whom Bond must protect (and later doing  some extra ciricular activities with, unsurprisingly), but Denise Richards  as Christmas Jones is totally outrageous. She displays dumb-as-a-post  dialogue and a performance to go with it, and by now you guys out there are  saying, &quot;What? Why not, she's a fox!&quot;  Well, the truth is yes she  is, but I've seen Wild Things and that was impressive enough.  She was  definitely better than Teri Hatcher in Tomorrow Never Dies, that's for  sure.The theme song, sung by Garbage, is also the best theme since the  Spy Who Loved Me.  For Your Eyes Only, Moonraker and Tomorrow Never Dies  were all good theme songs but this one stands out above them and being  surpassed only by Carly Simon's song.  Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die  and Goldfinger's themes are superb, also.For some unknown reason this  film's extras are not that impressive when compared to the rest of the  series'.  Yes, there are two audio commentaries but first they have to be  interesting before you can sit for two hours listening to how they did this  or that.

With all those gadgets, Bond movies started to seem like a visit to Sharper Image or Brookstone. Unfortunately, this movie is distracted somewhat (The previous movie, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, is far superior and more coherent.), and the British superspy is still driving that German sportscar, and using that grappling hook/watch. Make sense? Not if you remember that Bond loved his martinis shaken and not stirred, his women in flocks and his cars British. I expected more from director Michael Apted: the plot is all over the place, the ending is abrupt, &quot;M&quot; does things that the British government would never allow a person of such power to do, and the villains are weak.  (The main villain is the actor who portrays the loveable character from &quot;The Full Monty&quot;. C'mon. What next? Elmo versus Bond?) If these type of things don't annoy you, and if you enjoy action movies, then you'll probably like the latest installment of the Bond franchise.

Here, this film is just plain boring.The film starts off strong with it's 15 minute long PTS. After a successful operation in Istanbul, A woman has terrorized the MI6 building and Bond successfully defeats her. Now if only the rest of the film were that strong... we then get into a ridiculous plot involving this girl Elektra King, an heiress to an oil company. Bond is assigned to protect her from a Superterrorist with a bullet lodged in his head. This leads Bond into a plot that is confusing, and incredibly hard to follow.It's incredibly disappointing that a film like this turned out to be so over the top and ridiculous.

King is appearantly is so evil she can make everyone turn into third rate soap opera stars gushing over their emotions instead of thinking logically. This film makes everything so personal to the point of being a joke. Everyone has something whine about or some regret. The World is Not Enough is far removed from Ian Fleming's books which were targeted for warm-blooded metrosexuals. Yes folks, Bond is a 90's man and he's not afraid to cry.The action scenes are dull and sometimes badly executed and the plot is far too convoluted even for a Bond film. I will admit this film is actually pretty stylish in terms of clothes and set decor but the dreary cinematography hampers the film's image quite a bit. I would say the last major insult was the return of Goldeneye's Valentin Zukovsky who is now just a comical fop as opposed to be a ruthless Russian gangster with a sense of humor.

478023,A16GJQ27XTZLLE,6305784906,"Rick Seals ""Transplanted OKie""","[1, 2]","The World Is Not Enough is Pierce Brosnan's third outing as 007. It's a fun, fast-moving action movie with a lot to offer. There is of course a pretty scientist, an interesting chase scene and a villainess/victim (watch the movie) who covers her behind-the-scenes activities well enough that some viewers may not pick her out as a co-conspirator until all the facts are lined up. The main bad guy in fact even has an interesting motive for his actions given that he himself is dying and will not live to see the plot come to fruition.A lot of heat has been thrown at this Bond film because of Denise Richards' wardrobe in her performance as Christmas Jones, a nuclear physicist. Her acting was fine to me but I can understand that short-shorts and a tank-top may seem strange choices in clothes for a scientist who disables nuclear warheads. However, note that the work is being done in Kazakhstan which is a country with a lot of hot, arid regions which when you add on a protective suit, equals a lot of body heat. So give the character some slack.The chase scenes involving Bond and a female assassin in the early stages of the film are un-remarkable but fun. The later chase scenes through the snowy Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan are much better. Who wouldn't like snowmobiles that apparently can fly?As mentioned above, the villains in this film are among the more interesting Bond foes over the years. The first main villain, Robert Carlyle's Renard, is a Soviet terrorist who has a bullet in his head that is inching deeper into his brain over time and will soon kill him. The other is an oil tycoon's daughter named Elektra King, played by Sophie Marceau, who having basically had her father assassinated, wants to destroy oil pipelines in the Middle-East to make sure a new one she is building will be the only one, thus making her ridiculously wealthy. There is more to her story but you will have to watch the movie to find out. At any rate, both characters are both interesting and fleshed out very well.Finally, Brosnan's Bond is not as silly as some of the Roger Moore outings but he is also not very close to Ian Fleming's book versions either. He quips frequently and is less serious than the Connery, Dalton or current Craig versions. Still, his take on the character is fun and fits the fast style of the film very well.

478024,ALD1CRUBY1365,6305784906,R. L. MILLER,"[2, 4]","Throughout most of Roger Moore's tenure as James Bond, all we heard was how he fell short of Sean Connery's greatness. If you don't count the sidestream ""Never Say Never Again"", Moore actually did one more Bond than Connery. Some ""pinch hitter"", huh. When Timothy Dalton took over, he wasn't around long enough for viewers to either get get used to him or come up with enough ways in which he didn't cut the mustard--less fool he. Then when Brosnan slipped into the role in ""Goldeneye"", all we heard was how ""slight"" he was (??). The truth of the matter is that each of the three ""lifers"" has put his own stamp on the role that is very consistent with James Bond as created by Fleming. Connery was the macho Scotsman, tough as nails and no pretensions--the Bond who was very much the man who turned down knighthood in the book version of ""Man With the Golden Gun"" by sending M a wire that began ""I am a Scottish peasant..."". Moore gave the role the urbane aspect that I think Cary Crant would have (did you know that he was on the short list before they found Connery?). But throughout Fleming's books, the Bond character has had a hot temper that has alternately stood him in good stead and gotten his tail in a wringer. Brosnan exhibits that Bond when the villan Renard taunts him with the fact that he slept with Elektra King before he did. BAM! Enraged, Bond decks him with one shot to the jaw. George Lazenby, another pinch hitter in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", wisecracked in an early scene; ""This never happened to the other fellow.""

Zwick,"[3, 3]","The latest James Bond opus, `The World is Not Enough,' makes for reasonably diverting escapist fare, provided, of course, one is not too  discriminating in one's moviegoing demands. Bursting at the seams with the  usual array of high-tech gadgetry and elaborate action stunts (including a  spectacular pre-credit boat chase along the majestic Thames), the film once  again stars Pierce Brosnan as the intrepid secret agent 007, undergoing a  myriad of hairbreadth escapes as he makes the world safe for the democratic  forces of the Western world.The quality of any Bond flick must be  measured by how well it fulfills several basic requirements: the quality of  its stunts, the level of its wit, the beauty of its women, the creativity  of its gadgets and the cleverness of its storyline. `The World is Not  Enough' fulfills most of these prerequisites fairly well although much of  the humor - except for some scenes early on involving Q - falls miserably  flat with the allegedly clever quips and one liners eliciting far more  groans than laughs. The story itself, though it sputters at points, always  seems to right itself at crucial moments. As always, profusion often leads  to confusion as more and more characters are introduced then dispatched  before we have had time to register exactly who they are or what part they  play in the proceedings. However, the writers and director Michael Apted  have provided a solid core around which to build their narrative: the  character of Elektra, played winningly by Sophie Marceau, the daughter of  an oil tycoon, who provides us, first, with a focal point of humanity and  sympathy and, then later on, one of ruthlessness and villainy. Rendered  enigmatic by her dual qualities of warm vulnerability and icy cold  malevolence, she turns her every interaction with Bond into a fascinating  duel of wills and wits. That is far more than can be said for the other  major female figure in the cast, Christmas Jones, the nuclear physicist  with the aerobics-instructor body, who, next to Elektra, looks even more  inane and insipid than that description sounds.As to the hardware and  the stunts, they, as usual, cannot be faulted in their imaginativeness and  technical proficiency, but the unending parade of ear-splitting explosions  and gun battles does begin to grow a bit wearying during the overlong 128  minute course of the film. Some judicious editing would certainly have  helped in tightening up the proceedings somewhat.`The World is Not  Enough' must, finally, be adjudged a success or failure based on one's love  or disdain for the Bond series. Those with no strong feelings either way  will find themselves relatively entertained by the movie's assortment of  stunts and actions and positively enthralled by the riveting performance of  Ms. Marceau - which is about all one can reasonably ask from a film of this  nature.",3,uneven but generally fun Bond film,965692800,"08 8, 2000",2000,2887,"['latest', 'James', 'Bond', 'opus', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'reasonably', 'diverting', 'escapist', 'fare', 'provided', 'course', 'one', 'not', 'too', 'discriminating', 'one', 'moviegoing', 'demands', 'Bursting', 'seams', 'usual', 'array', 'high-tech', 'gadgetry', 'elaborate', 'action', 'stunts', 'including', 'spectacular', 'pre-credit', 'boat', 'chase', 'majestic', 'Thames', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'stars', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'intrepid', 'secret', 'agent', '007', 'undergoing', 'myriad', 'hairbreadth', 'escapes', 'world', 'safe', 'democratic', 'forces', 'Western', 'world.The', 'quality', 'Bond', 'flick', 'must', 'be', 'measured', 'how', 'well', 'several', 'basic', 'requirements', 'quality', 'stunts', 'level', 'wit', 'beauty', 'women', 'creativity', 'gadgets', 'cleverness', 'storyline', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'fulfills', 'most', 'prerequisites', 'fairly', 'well', 'much', 'humor', 'scenes', 'early', 'involving', 'Q', 'miserably', 'flat', 'allegedly', 'clever', 'quips', 'one', 'liners', 'eliciting', 'far', 'more', 'groans', 'laughs', 'story', 'points', 'always', 'right', 'crucial', 'moments', 'always', 'profusion', 'often', 'confusion', 'more', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'dispatched', 'have', 'had', 'time', 'register', 'exactly', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'part', 'play', 'proceedings', 'However', 'writers', 'director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'have', 'provided', 'solid', 'core', 'build', 'narrative', 'character', 'Elektra', 'played', 'winningly', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'daughter', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'who', 'first', 'focal', 'point', 'humanity', 'sympathy', 'then', 'later', 'one', 'ruthlessness', 'villainy', 'Rendered', 'enigmatic', 'dual', 'qualities', 'warm', 'vulnerability', 'icy', 'cold', 'malevolence', 'interaction', 'Bond', 'fascinating', 'duel', 'wills', 'wits', 'far', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'major', 'female', 'figure', 'cast', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'aerobics-instructor', 'body', 'who', 'next', 'Elektra', 'even', 'more', 'inane', 'insipid', 'description', 'sounds.As', 'hardware', 'stunts', 'usual', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'imaginativeness', 'technical', 'proficiency', 'unending', 'parade', 'ear-splitting', 'explosions', 'gun', 'battles', 'begin', 'grow', 'bit', 'wearying', 'overlong', '128', 'minute', 'course', 'film', 'judicious', 'editing', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'helped', 'tightening', 'up', 'proceedings', 'somewhat.', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'must', 'finally', 'be', 'adjudged', 'success', 'failure', 'based', 'one', 'love', 'disdain', 'Bond', 'series', 'strong', 'feelings', 'way', 'will', 'find', 'relatively', 'entertained', 'movie', 'assortment', 'stunts', 'actions', 'positively', 'enthralled', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Ms.', 'Marceau', 'one', 'can', 'reasonably', 'ask', 'film', 'nature']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

I love the Bond flicks, and Brosnan is easily the best, but he's weighted down by a story that starts out appropriately complex, but then becomes too complex for it's own good, with too many plans-within-plans, too many betrayals, and way too many explosions.In this outer, Bond must protect a beautiful heiress, Elektra King, from a seemingly invincible and cold-blooded killer, Renard.  A bullet making its way through Renard's skull is slowly killling him, even as it renders him impervious to pain.  Elektra (Sophie Marceau), her father murdered in the first few minutes of TWINE, now stands ready to complete a monumental oil pipeline through the former Soviet central asia.  Because the pipeline will assure the west's energy needs through the next century, and with competing projects underway in Russia, both it and Elektra become prime targets.  But all is not it seems, as Bond learns with a bang.Unfortunately, much of TWINE seems that way, with Bond uncovering a plot just in time for it to prove a cover for something darker.  Usually, the revelation comes with the appropriate explosion, so, by the time the real climax occurs, we're already too punch-drunk to notice or even care.  the only hint of a structure is the standard formula with Bond falling into bed with every beautfiful woman he meets, and action sequences that seem to run out of sync with the script.

TWINE is a definite improvement on 'Tomorrow Never Dies' which was pretty forgettable. Bond's nemesis is a terrorist named Renard (Robert Carlyle) a man who feels no pain, thanks to a bullet lodged in his brain. With such an interesting background I thought his character could have been developed further. He might have turned out as a classic Bond villain. Brosnan could do well to loose the brooding scowl because I think he should lighten up a little. In a documentary featured on this disc, Brosnan says he likes having Bond's darker side explored. For this they accused Timothy Dalton of being too stiff and serious! Apart from that Pierce is a great James Bond. He can't be held responsible for the film's shortcomings.Judi Dench returns as 'M', the head of MI6 and 007's boss. This time around she has a more substantial role. Electra King (Sophie Marceau) and Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) are the two Bond girls but as usual the girls are present mostly for show and little else. Like Renard, Electra King poses as an intriguing figure but her potential is unrealised. Robbie Coltrane also reprises his 'Goldeneye' role of Valentin Zukovsky. The opening sequence with 007 racing down the river Thames in a power boat is just fantastic. This is also Desmond Llewelyn's last appearance as 'Q', MI6's gadget man. There's a short tribute to him on this disc accompanied fittingly by the theme of The Spy Who Loved Me, 'Nobody Does It Better'.",4,"Intense and gripping, despite some weak points",984096000,"03 9, 2001",2001,1555,"['1995', 'excellent', ""'Goldeneye"", 'Brosnan', 'finally', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'role', '007', 'TWINE', 'definite', 'improvement', 'Never', 'Dies', 'was', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'Bond', 'nemesis', 'terrorist', 'named', 'Renard', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'man', 'who', 'pain', 'thanks', 'bullet', 'lodged', 'brain', 'such', 'interesting', 'background', 'thought', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'further', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'classic', 'Bond', 'villain', 'Brosnan', 'could', 'do', 'well', 'loose', 'brooding', 'scowl', 'think', 'should', 'lighten', 'up', 'little', 'documentary', 'featured', 'disc', 'Brosnan', 'having', 'Bond', 'darker', 'side', 'explored', 'accused', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'being', 'too', 'stiff', 'serious', 'Apart', 'Pierce', 'great', 'James', 'Bond', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'held', 'responsible', 'film', 'shortcomings.Judi', 'Dench', ""'M"", 'head', 'MI6', '007', 'boss', 'time', 'more', 'substantial', 'role', 'Electra', 'King', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'are', 'two', 'Bond', 'girls', 'usual', 'girls', 'are', 'present', 'mostly', 'show', 'little', 'else', 'Renard', 'Electra', 'King', 'intriguing', 'figure', 'potential', 'unrealised', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'also', ""'Goldeneye"", 'role', 'Valentin', 'Zukovsky', 'opening', 'sequence', '007', 'racing', 'down', 'river', 'Thames', 'power', 'boat', 'just', 'fantastic', 'also', 'Desmond', 'Llewelyn', 'last', 'appearance', 'Q', 'MI6', 'gadget', 'man', 'short', 'tribute', 'disc', 'accompanied', 'fittingly', 'theme', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Loved', 'Me', ""'Nobody"", 'Better']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Especially after the mind bender that  Tommorow Never Dies was.First the biggest problem is the plot. The story just drags on and on without any climaxes. It is boring. Very boring. I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did.The second problem was the supporting cast. Whoever made the descision to cast Sophie Marceaux as femme fatale. Made a fatale mistake. She's a joke. Issabelle Adjani would have been a much better choice. The same goes for the villain Robert Carlisle--I really did not find him that scary or effective as a villain.Denise Richards was nothing but eye candy and does nothing to enhance the movie. If she had not been in the film I would not have missed her at all.The only pluses in this film are Pierce Brosnan who did a great job again. As well as the witty double entendres ""I was wrong Christmas does come twice a year!"" Which I found quite amusing.Frankly the film feels as if it had been slapped together so that they could meet the quota of 2 years between Bond films. After this travesty no wonder the creators wanted to take 3 years instead of two for putting out the next film (Die Another Day).

When an oil tycoon is killed inside MI-6, Bond must protect his daughter and thwart a complex plot to contaminate the world's oil supply.Even though the story has become somewhat more relevant in today's political climate, at times it simply lacks the energy and urgency of other Bond adventures. The stakes are high enough, but the movie never presents them with enough gusto to rise above the typical Bond formula. You get the requisite mixture of dialogue and action sequences, and some elements that are potentially interesting (such as Bond's shoulder injury and M's larger role) aren't expanded on in a satisfying fashion. Renard is a villain with a great gimmick in the vein of Jaws and Oddjob, yet he ends up underdeveloped. The film gives us one of the best Bond girls (Sophie Marceau) along with one of the worst (Denise Richards). It also features the last appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q, who passed away shortly after the film premiered.This dvd isn't as loaded as the older Bond films. You get two audio commentaries, a short, superficial making-of documentary, and one of those ""extended-viewing"" modes where clicking on an icon during the film will bring up some behind-the-scenes footage. There's also the cool music video from Garbage. It's a decent collection of goodies, just not enough (no pun intended). None of the Brosnan Bond movies can be called bad, and The World is Not Enough definitely tops some of the franchise's past efforts.

Some of the top action scenes include the Boat Chase, James Bond and Electra King(a very beautiful woman) getting chased while skiing and the helicopter scene. The basic story is that James Bond is sent to protect an oil heiress, whom unknown forces are trying to kill.Bond thinks it is because they don't want competition from her Oil pipeline. However, the story takes a surprise twist that most won't see coming.

478053,ANHGGQT4HTEK0,6305784906,Sonia,"[1, 2]","The World Is Not Enough is typical James Bond.  Part thriller and part comedy.  Slick and inventive.  If you're looking for new aspects to the series, you aren't going to get it here.  Part of the charm of 007 is the tried and true formula of doing the same things over and over, but with different characters and new locations.The basic plot, which I feel I can give you about the first five minutes because after that I'll spoil it.  It gets too dense to explain anyway, you just have to see it.  An oil-tycoon friend of M's (Judi Dench) is killed, and his daughter is feared to be next after her recent escape from the clutches of a power-hungry madman, Renard (Robert Carlyle).  James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is sent to protect her and thwart the villain.  I have a confession.  With all my nagging about plot sequence, inconsistencies, characterizations, etc. I must tell you that for a James Bond movie I virtually let all that stuff go out the window.  Not sure why, but since I know the formula so well, it's almost more fun to watch for the trademark stuff.  Let's go through and see which ones you also like watching for.James Bond.  007.  The man himself.  There have been many.  No one can hold a candle to Sean Connery.  He IS James Bond.  Everyone since has had some pretty big shoes to fill.  Pierce Brosnan comes to the closest to the master, in my estimation.  Roger Moore was Bond when I was a kid, so I like him because the first one I ever saw was For Your Eyes Only.  Timothy Dalton was a disaster, sheesh, who picked that guy?  But Brosnan affects the same charm, wit and ease of the character as Connery....almost.There are always two gorgeous Bond babes.  Bond always sleeps with both of them.  One of them always ends up dead.  Note to female readers: don't sleep with James Bond, because then you only have a 50/50 shot at surviving the next 72 hours or so.  Not good odds, so don't chance it.This time it's Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) the daughter of the dead oil tycoon that James must protect and then there's nuclear physicist Christmas Jones (Denise Richards).  I would be remiss if I didn't mention, daring escapes, sensational chase sequences, exotic locations, diabolical villains and fantastical ways to meet one's demise.  My favorite ""weapon"" in this movie was the monstrously huge multi-bladed tree trimmer contraption dangling from a menacing helicopter.  They flew that sucker around sawing through all kinds of neat stuff.Our dear James would not be complete without the old stand-bys back at British intelligence.  M, Bond's boss whom Dame Judi Dench plays with conviction and respect.  Even though it is obviously far beneath her talent, she never lets up for a moment.  Miss Moneypenny and a new face in R (John Cleese), Q's gadget guru apprentice.On a sad note, when you get the video, there is a tribute to Desmond Llewelyn who has been playing Q since 1963.  In the film, the retirement of Q is mentioned in the story, but sadly, Desmond Llewelyn passed away last year and the video tribute to him at the beginning of the video is touching and appropriate for a man who was so dedicated to a single character.  The storyline and plot gets a little muddled and confusing in a couple spots, mostly in favor of demonstrating some of the trademark cool Bond stuff instead.  If you're the kind of James Bond fan who enjoys the old standards, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  If you are the fan who wants to see something new, this isn't for you.I've got Dr. No and Goldfinger in my video cabinet.  I'm still waiting for a movie to top the ultimate good guy-villain exchange, ""Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?  No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to die.""  I mean, how cool is that?  Cheesy and hip at the same time.  That's the James Bond genre, if you can get through all the double entendres without grimacing, you'll be OK.  The World Is Not Enough, in this case, the video is not enough.

Susan Stark of the Detroit News claims ""She (Sophie Marceau) turns out to be the most complex female character ever introduced in the series, and one of the most seductive.""  That's one theory.  Actually, when they tried to make her seem less two dimensional by having her acting all sad that her boyfriend was destined to impotency, it seemed stupid, unconvincing, and if at all possible, it would have happened when they met (if at all).  ""Oh,"" Susan might say, ""that's the profound effect that Remington had on her.""  If it's true that her heart was rehabilitated, the effect should have lasted beyond the one scene.""I'm going to check on the pipeline.""  They get their skis, they ski, they're attacked.  Bad guys all go after Pierce instead of the chick whose life they're supposed to be threatening...he knows the terrain well enough to pull out of a slalom just before going over a cliff.  Everyone is saved.  We never even see the pipeline at this location.  (A co-viewer recalls seeing pipeline markers, though.  So then, the pipeline was under the snow?  Did she plan to thaw it?  Why is the corporate head ""going down to check on the pipeline"" anyway?  Don't contractors do that sort of thing, rather than financiers?I can buy that perhaps a 00 agent might be familiar with a boat which is being developed, and he could be thorough enough to know what sort of impact it could withstand.  I don't buy that he is also familiar enough with the encasing building's architecture to know that his boat's structural integrity exceeds that of the wall of the building holding it.  It is also implausible that the drag force resulting from the wall collision would have negligible effect on the momentum of the boat.  He should have crashed in the street instead of landing in the water.  A five minute Bond film, I think, would be a very cool way to end the series.  Oh well.Water has a high coefficient of friction compared to air.  It is physically impossible for his boat to travel at the same velocity under water (especially with an open roof) as it did in the air.  Watching carefully, his boat did indeed flip over, the effect of which was edited out.Lastly, regarding the boat sequence, such a thing was done more believably in ""Live And Let Die"".  It was even reprised in ""Moonraker.""We go from the boat scene in ""Live and Let Die"" to the skiing scene from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", once again, done better in the original.  Well, we also did have the skiing scenes in ""For Your Eyes Only"".  Predictable is perhaps the best adjective to describe the bad guy's x-wing having a parachute on it.  So much for suspense.  And how about the gratuitous x-wings crashing into each other for no reason?And then at the nuclear site, chaos starts breaking loose, Brosnen's first thought is 'save the pretty girl, even if she did expose me as an imposter.'  Very realistic.So why, if Judy Dench is so great as M, does she have fear and nervousness in her eyes as she admonishes Remington?  We all know refusing to deal with terrorists is standard operating procedure, including the spoiled brat.

James  Bond movies, for almost 40 years, have been some of the best escapist  fantasy cinema has to offer. &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; is in the  top half of Bond films in terms of overall quality, with some fantastically  staged action scenes (even if a couple are nicked from other Bond films).  Pierce Brosnan continues to stake out his place as the second best Bond,  after Connery. He's got style, charm, a dry sense of humor, and a sense  that this is all a bit daft, which helps immeasurably. The villain Renard  is poorly written, but Robert Carlyle does his best with the part. Sophie  Marceau is an anti-Bond Girl type who thinks a lot like Bond. Very sexy and  convincing, but with a girl-gone-bad attitude that is a great foil for  Brosnan. Denise Richards is one of the worst Bond girls ever (and yes, her  role -- a twenty-something NUCLEAR PHYSICIST working in Azerbaijan -- is  preposterous), but fortunately, Marceau gets far more screen time. TWINE is  different as well in that M (a dignified Judi Dench) gets caught up in the  intrigue and action to a far greater extent than any other Bond film. So  overall, even with the awful double-double-entendres at the end of the film  that had the entire theater groaning when I first saw it, &quot;The World  Is Not Enough&quot; is a more-than-worthy addition to the Bond canon.

Pierce Brosnan returns as 007, not quite as sharp as he was in ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" but certainly older and with more gadgets.  In this one, he teams up with physicist(!) Denise Richards (whose acting style is about as painful as Tanya Roberts' was in the moronic ""A View to a Kill"") to thwart the evil plans of man-eater Sophie Marceau and her terrorist boyfriend, a completely underused Robert Carlyle.  The basic idea is good, but too often the script only makes passing reference to the issues it raises.  So, viewers who want to see what happens with a villain that cannot feel pain are expected to be satisfied instead with a standard hand-to-hand fight scene; those anticipating a humanized Bond's wounds to become central to the story will discover they must make due with simply seeing him for a while with an arm sling.

I could go on for pages why I didn't like this film much, and the rating reflects that, but I'll just give a few comments on the DVD extras. First the  introduction is too obnoxious and there is no way to skip past it. The very  short, 15 minute, 'making of' feature was more like a 'E!' feature from TV  with some rather boring interviews with some of the cast and crew. The  'secrets' section was very interesting with storyboards combined with  unfinished scenes that showed what the shots looked like before final  production. The video by Garbage is very good too. It's a great song  although short. The music video isn't just cut scenes from the movie,  although it has them, but a whole little story in itself.

Much of the strength of this film lies with director Michael  Apted, whose previous credits are limited almost exlusively to dramas  (&quot;Blink&quot;, &quot;Nell&quot;, &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;) and  documentaries (&quot;Incident at Odwala&quot;).  The result of his  direction, as well as a superb script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade  (&quot;Plunkett &amp; Macleane&quot;) is a Bond film that at last allows  some complex character relationships to underline the pyrotechnic action.  From an exhilarating opening sequence (the best of perhaps any of the Bond  films), the film rolls out with a plot that seems a bit better constructed  that most of the other Bond films, some interesting character interaction  and some of the most human villains the series has ever been able to offer.  Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle turn in excellent performances, much  better than many of the other high profile actors to portray villains in  the series (such as the cartoonish performances given by Christopher Walken  and Jonathan Pryce, to name a couple).  Brosnan looks and acts the part  better than any Bond in years: he is undoubtedly the best man for the role  besides Sean Connery himself.  With some highly original action sequences  (I particularly liked the &quot;buzzsaw helicopter&quot; sequence) and a  story that for a change actually explores Bond's darker side, &quot;The  World is Not Enough&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the finest films in the  series.",4,"Stirring, not shaky",958521600,"05 17, 2000",2000,1711,"['relative', 'failed', 'attempts', 'quot', 'updating', 'quot', 'Bond', 'quot', 'Goldeneye', 'quot', 'quot', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'quot', 'Michael', 'Wilson', 'Barbara', 'Broccoli', 'finally', 'get', 'right', 'quot', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'quot', 'Much', 'strength', 'film', 'director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'previous', 'credits', 'are', 'limited', 'almost', 'exlusively', 'dramas', 'quot', 'Blink', 'quot', 'quot', 'Nell', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gorillas', 'Mist', 'quot', 'documentaries', 'quot', 'Incident', 'Odwala', 'quot', 'result', 'direction', 'as', 'well', 'superb', 'script', 'Neal', 'Purvis', 'Robert', 'Wade', 'quot', 'Plunkett', 'amp', 'Macleane', 'quot', 'Bond', 'film', 'last', 'allows', 'complex', 'character', 'relationships', 'underline', 'pyrotechnic', 'action', 'exhilarating', 'opening', 'sequence', 'best', 'perhaps', 'Bond', 'films', 'film', 'out', 'plot', 'bit', 'better', 'constructed', 'most', 'other', 'Bond', 'films', 'interesting', 'character', 'interaction', 'most', 'human', 'series', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'offer', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'turn', 'excellent', 'performances', 'much', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'high', 'profile', 'actors', 'portray', 'villains', 'series', 'such', 'cartoonish', 'performances', 'given', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'name', 'couple', 'Brosnan', 'part', 'better', 'Bond', 'years', 'undoubtedly', 'best', 'man', 'role', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'highly', 'original', 'action', 'sequences', 'particularly', 'liked', 'quot', 'helicopter', 'quot', 'sequence', 'story', 'change', 'actually', 'Bond', 'darker', 'side', 'quot', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'quot', 'opinion', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'series']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

478064,A3VCFKG8PVV0CO,6305784906,Stingray Ramone,"[7, 8]","After a surprisingly dismal entry in Tomorrow Never Dies, Pierce Brosnan bounces back with an emphatic performance in Bond #19, The World Is Not Enough.  That is not to say Brosnan's outing in his previous film was horrendous (In fact, Brosnan was solid in Tomorrow Never Dies), but he was graced with a more alluring storyline, although at times spotty in its execution.  Aside from the unimpressive Bond girl stint of the stunning and delectable Denise Richards, all aspects of the film computed to make The World Is Not Enough a worthy rival to the classic Goldeneye, as Brosnan's best Bond film.The plot takes a cue from Dalton's The Living Daylights, in that it is dark, deliberate, methodical, complicated and hence, somewhat confusing.  The story starts off with Bond in a Swiss bank located in Bilbao, Spain, where our hero secures the money of a wealthy oil magnate, Sir Robert King.  Bond returns to MI6 in London and hands over the the cash to King, but he is mysteriously assassinated thereafter.  007 deduces his daughter, Elektra King, played brilliantly by the unbelievably sultry Sophie Marceau, will be targeted next by King's killer.  Bond believes that an anarchist, Renard (Robert Carlyle of The Full Monty fame), who has a bullet entrapped in his brain, near his medulla oblongata and had previously kidnapped Elektra, is the one responsible for King's untimely death and will be Elektra's potential assailant.  With that, Bond ventures to Azerbaijan, where Elektra is organizing an operation to build a breakthrough oil pipeline, to shield Elektra and hunt down the suspected terrorist.  As Bond further delves into his investigation, he exposes that Elektra has Stockholm Syndrome, meaning she has fallen in love with her abductor, Renard and it turns out she was just playing Bond all along.  Together, Elektra and Renard attempt to take control of the Western oil supply, by detonating a nuclear bomb in Istanbul, where all three competing pipelines lead to.  Bond tags along with nuclear scientist, Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), who earlier attempted to thwart Renard in his successful quest to capture a nuclear bomb at a nuclear bomb deactivation facility, to save the day.The World Is Not Enough is a fun, provocative, edge-of-your-seat thriller, exhibiting Brosnan at the top of his game.  This is Brosnan's most inspired performance, even more so than Goldeneye, as he seems to display more passion into this effort.  Equally impressive is the show-stopping Sophie Marceau, who portrays Elektra, as the mentally frenetic, chilling, yet thrilling ""good-girl-gone-really-bad"" vixen.  Marceau stands out as the best Bond girl villain in the entire series and an honorable mention as one of the very best Bond girls, overall.  Robert Carlyle is cold and calculating as the menacing, seemingly invincible, impervious, and tragic Renard.  Denise Richards is not as bad as what many critics and die-hard or casual Bond fans would claim her to be.  Definitely, Denise is pretty on-screen eye candy, but of course, she is not exactly gifted in acting skills, and her outing is no exception, though she was used quite well, in that she had rather simple lines in the film.  The supporting cast receives kudos for being a solid cast.  Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), as previously seen in Goldeneye, steps into a bigger role, as a comic relief tough guy.  M (Judi Dench) also receives a boost into a magnified role and she is surprisingly solid.  Of course, Q, played by the late Desmond Llewellyn makes a short, bittersweet farewell appearance.As for the story and screenplay, The World Is Not Enough comes through with an excellent rhythmic flow, although the events tend to zip and zap with quick transitions, at times.  The action sequences are formidable and more impactful than those of Goldeneye, in my honest opinion.  The rip-roaring pre-title sequence sets the tone of the film beautifully, with the pipeline and Nuclear bomb hijack scenes standing out.  The climax is superb and suspenseful, especially the torture scene where Elektra, in sultry, methodical fashion, gets closer and closer to breaking Bond's neck.  To cap it all off, Garbage, with the sexy redhead lead Shirley Manson at vocals, rocks with an excellent theme song.  All in all, The World Is Not Enough is a sexy, smart, rollercoaster of an adventure, which probably unseats Goldeneye as Brosnan's finest accomplishment as Bond.",5,I thought Christmas only comes once a year...,1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,4440,"['surprisingly', 'dismal', 'entry', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'back', 'emphatic', 'performance', 'Bond', '19', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'not', 'say', 'Brosnan', 'outing', 'previous', 'film', 'was', 'horrendous', 'fact', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'solid', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'was', 'graced', 'more', 'alluring', 'storyline', 'times', 'spotty', 'execution', 'Aside', 'unimpressive', 'Bond', 'girl', 'stint', 'stunning', 'delectable', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'aspects', 'film', 'computed', 'make', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'worthy', 'rival', 'classic', 'Goldeneye', 'Brosnan', 'best', 'Bond', 'film.The', 'plot', 'cue', 'Dalton', 'Living', 'Daylights', 'dark', 'deliberate', 'methodical', 'complicated', 'hence', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'story', 'Bond', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'located', 'Bilbao', 'Spain', 'where', 'hero', 'money', 'wealthy', 'oil', 'magnate', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'King', 'Bond', 'returns', 'MI6', 'London', 'hands', 'cash', 'King', 'mysteriously', 'assassinated', 'thereafter', '007', 'deduces', 'daughter', 'Elektra', 'King', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'unbelievably', 'sultry', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'will', 'be', 'targeted', 'next', 'King', 'killer', 'Bond', 'anarchist', 'Renard', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Full', 'Monty', 'fame', 'who', 'bullet', 'entrapped', 'brain', 'medulla', 'oblongata', 'had', 'previously', 'kidnapped', 'Elektra', 'one', 'responsible', 'King', 'untimely', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'Elektra', 'potential', 'assailant', 'Bond', 'ventures', 'Azerbaijan', 'where', 'Elektra', 'organizing', 'operation', 'build', 'breakthrough', 'oil', 'pipeline', 'shield', 'Elektra', 'hunt', 'down', 'suspected', 'terrorist', 'Bond', 'further', 'delves', 'investigation', 'Elektra', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'meaning', 'fallen', 'love', 'abductor', 'Renard', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'playing', 'Bond', 'along', 'Together', 'Elektra', 'Renard', 'attempt', 'take', 'control', 'Western', 'oil', 'supply', 'detonating', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'Istanbul', 'where', 'three', 'competing', 'pipelines', 'lead', 'Bond', 'tags', 'nuclear', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Christmas', 'Jones', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'who', 'earlier', 'attempted', 'thwart', 'Renard', 'successful', 'quest', 'capture', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'deactivation', 'facility', 'save', 'day.The', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'fun', 'provocative', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'thriller', 'exhibiting', 'Brosnan', 'top', 'game', 'Brosnan', 'most', 'inspired', 'performance', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Goldeneye', 'display', 'more', 'passion', 'effort', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'show-stopping', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'who', 'Elektra', 'mentally', 'frenetic', 'chilling', 'yet', 'thrilling', 'good-girl-gone-really-bad', 'vixen', 'Marceau', 'out', 'best', 'Bond', 'girl', 'villain', 'entire', 'series', 'honorable', 'mention', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'Bond', 'girls', 'overall', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'cold', 'calculating', 'menacing', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'impervious', 'tragic', 'Renard', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'what', 'many', 'critics', 'die-hard', 'casual', 'Bond', 'fans', 'would', 'claim', 'be', 'Definitely', 'Denise', 'pretty', 'on-screen', 'eye', 'candy', 'course', 'not', 'exactly', 'gifted', 'acting', 'skills', 'outing', 'exception', 'was', 'used', 'quite', 'well', 'had', 'rather', 'simple', 'lines', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'receives', 'kudos', 'being', 'solid', 'cast', 'Valentin', 'Zukovsky', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'previously', 'seen', 'Goldeneye', 'bigger', 'role', 'comic', 'relief', 'tough', 'guy', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'also', 'boost', 'magnified', 'role', 'surprisingly', 'solid', 'course', 'Q', 'played', 'late', 'Desmond', 'Llewellyn', 'short', 'bittersweet', 'farewell', 'appearance.As', 'story', 'screenplay', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'through', 'excellent', 'rhythmic', 'flow', 'events', 'tend', 'zip', 'zap', 'quick', 'transitions', 'times', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'formidable', 'more', 'impactful', 'Goldeneye', 'honest', 'opinion', 'rip-roaring', 'pre-title', 'sequence', 'tone', 'film', 'beautifully', 'pipeline', 'Nuclear', 'bomb', 'hijack', 'scenes', 'standing', 'out', 'climax', 'superb', 'suspenseful', 'especially', 'torture', 'scene', 'where', 'Elektra', 'sultry', 'methodical', 'fashion', 'closer', 'closer', 'breaking', 'Bond', 'neck', 'cap', 'off', 'Garbage', 'sexy', 'redhead', 'lead', 'Shirley', 'Manson', 'vocals', 'rocks', 'excellent', 'theme', 'song', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'sexy', 'smart', 'rollercoaster', 'adventure', 'probably', 'Goldeneye', 'Brosnan', 'finest', 'accomplishment', 'Bond']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

First off, this 19th Bond epic begins with a bang.  Before the title sequence even starts, Bond has escaped capture from crooked bankers, survived a massive explosion which guts out MI6 headquarters and pursues a really attractive female assasin in what must be the most suped up jet boat in cinema history.  It's just a shame that the rest of the film can't top the exciting first ten or twelve minutes.The plot is Bond appropriate, Agent 007 is sent to protect a heiress to an oil industry who has been targeted by a super terrorist who is impervious to pain, he has a bullet lodged in his brain.  Before long, Bond embroiled in a complicated (and hard to follow) plot to rule the oil industry and then the world.  What is disappointing about this installment is the films sometimes slow pace and final battle scene.The climax of the film takes place on a submarine and is too reminiscent of the end of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;.  However, the strengths of the film are in the suprisingly strong performances (excluding Denise Richards).  M has a more prominant role in this round which makes sense because she's played again by Oscar winner Judi Dench.  Her M character is for more empathetic this time and you can tell that she is concerned about Bond's safety.  This is a welcome plot development and I hope that Brosnan and Dench have more dramatic scenes with each other in future Bond films.While just a tad disappointing, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; is entertaining enough.",3,Middle ground Bond,974764800,"11 21, 2000",2000,1747,"['Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'third', '007', 'outing', 'quot', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'quot', 'ingrediants', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'series', 'love', 'explosions', 'cool', 'action', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'course', 'Bond', 'played', 'Brosnan', 'somehow', 'film', 'beat', 'First', 'off', '19th', 'Bond', 'epic', 'bang', 'title', 'sequence', 'even', 'Bond', 'escaped', 'capture', 'crooked', 'bankers', 'survived', 'massive', 'explosion', 'out', 'MI6', 'headquarters', 'really', 'attractive', 'female', 'assasin', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'suped', 'up', 'jet', 'boat', 'cinema', 'history', 'just', 'shame', 'rest', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'top', 'exciting', 'first', 'twelve', 'minutes.The', 'plot', 'Bond', 'appropriate', 'Agent', '007', 'sent', 'protect', 'heiress', 'oil', 'industry', 'who', 'been', 'targeted', 'super', 'terrorist', 'who', 'impervious', 'pain', 'bullet', 'lodged', 'brain', 'long', 'Bond', 'embroiled', 'complicated', 'hard', 'follow', 'plot', 'rule', 'oil', 'industry', 'then', 'world', 'What', 'disappointing', 'installment', 'films', 'sometimes', 'slow', 'pace', 'final', 'battle', 'scene.The', 'climax', 'film', 'place', 'submarine', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'end', 'quot', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'quot', 'However', 'strengths', 'film', 'are', 'suprisingly', 'strong', 'performances', 'excluding', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'M', 'more', 'prominant', 'role', 'round', 'sense', 'played', 'again', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'M', 'character', 'more', 'empathetic', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'concerned', 'Bond', 'safety', 'welcome', 'plot', 'development', 'hope', 'Brosnan', 'Dench', 'have', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'other', 'future', 'Bond', 'films.While', 'just', 'tad', 'disappointing', 'quot', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'quot', 'entertaining', 'enough']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Bond, the  supersmart, supercool secret agent is an anachronism: he belongs to a  bygone age in which Britain was a superpower. However, the recent films  have altogether energetically (albeit with mixed results) brought him up to  date. The traditionally male-centred attitude of the films is missing:  Bond's superior, M, in these films is a woman. Moneypenny the secretary is  no longer the dizzy chick eagerly infatuated with Bond. She gets to rebuff  him and put him in his place. A new low in violence is also reached in the  films. In the opening scenes of this one, he callously points a gun in a  man's chest (reminiscent of one of the signature touches of John Woo) and  in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, he stabs a man with a knife (!) towards  the end, which is highly uncharacteristic of the old Bond who is much more  refined in his methods.

The action scenes have no momentum, the storylines feel like retreads without the witty, apocalyptic urgency of the early films, and everything just feels rushed.Robert Carlysle is a great villain but he's pretty much by the numbers for the second half.  Nothing is made of the irony that Bond is a hero who cannot connect with feelings and Carlysle is a villain who can't physically feel anything.(Why couldn't Carlysle, lying at the bottom in the climax, laugh loudly at Bond and defiantly yell, ""Hey, Bond...Didn't hurt!"").This entry also has the most cringe-worthy line of all the Bond films: ""Who says Christmas only comes once a year?""Oh, how the mighty have fallen.",2,Enough is nearly Enough,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,1164,"['think', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'had', 'most', 'impressive', 'debut', 'James', 'Bond', '1995', 'GOLDENEYE', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'first', 'invented', 'role', '1962', 'George', 'Lazeby', 'only', 'got', 'one', 'shot', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'did', ""n't"", 'taylor', 'role', 'third', 'outing', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'lack', 'humor', 'never', 'allowed', 'fit', '007', '.But', 'GOLDENEYE', 'producers', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'really', 'squandered', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'have', 'role', 'jumping', 'lifeless', 'scripts', 'listless', 'direction', 'action', 'scenes', 'have', 'momentum', 'storylines', 'feel', 'retreads', 'witty', 'apocalyptic', 'urgency', 'early', 'films', 'everything', 'just', 'feels', 'rushed.Robert', 'Carlysle', 'great', 'villain', 'pretty', 'much', 'numbers', 'second', 'half', 'Nothing', 'made', 'irony', 'Bond', 'hero', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'connect', 'feelings', 'Carlysle', 'villain', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'physically', 'feel', 'anything', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'Carlysle', 'lying', 'bottom', 'climax', 'laugh', 'loudly', 'Bond', 'defiantly', 'yell', 'Hey', 'Bond', 'Did', ""n't"", 'hurt', '.This', 'entry', 'also', 'most', 'cringe-worthy', 'line', 'Bond', 'films', 'Who', 'Christmas', 'only', 'once', 'year', 'Oh', 'how', 'mighty', 'have', 'fallen']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

First, it has a decent  story for a bond film, but do they really need to get this advanced? The  first bond films were, guys gonna blow up the earth, bonds gotta stop him,  plot twist, bond gets the woman. Now days, they think we need mission:  impossible like stories to enjoy the film. We are gonna see the film for 2  reasons: 1. The shoot-em-up blow-em-up (no pun intended) action 2. And the  women We dont care about these deep plots! The other high point is there is  a lot of action, nothing memorable, we've seen it before, but still cool.  Characters is something rarely developed in bond films and that holds true  in this film. The enemy is hardly hateable. We dont care if Bond wins or  not. We just want to see Denise Richards, and thats why the films do well.

478080,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6305784906,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","After the disappointment of Tomorrow Never Days, it perhaps shouldn't have been too surprising that, as per the usual EON pattern of alternating good and bad Bond films, The World is Not Enough turned out rather well. It helps that it has a stronger plot this time round as well as some attempt at an element of mystery - along with For Your Eyes Only this is the only Bond where the identity of the real villain is withheld for the first half of the movie. It's also more character-based than usual, with some interesting dialogue that takes on a different dimension once you know who's on the side of the angels and who isn't. The Maguffin is an oil-based variation on Goldfinger's big scheme, but the execution is very different and rather more grounded. Brosnan has the best character writing of his tenure but isn't always up to it: the moments of ruthlessness convince but he's one of those actors who can't stand still and just be and always has to do something, making him seem somewhat ADDS in some scenes and leads to a couple of strange bits of gurning. Yet it can still lay claim to being his best performance in the role, and the presence of Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle helps raise the acting bar enough so that even Denise Richards' hot pant wearing nuclear scientist - in-joke casting at its finest - isn't quite as bad as she's been painted.There's a slightly schizoid feel to Michael Apted's direction at times seeming a tad uncertain and stylistically very different from Vic Armstrong's action scenes. It's certainly not difficult to tell who shot what, and not just because Armstrong seems better at hiding the significant height difference between Brosnan and Carlyle. While still variable (the opening boat chase has a few too many sight gags and the helicopter/chainsaw sequence doesn't work as well as it should), the action scenes are much better handled this time round and much better integrated into the story. Despite some awful wisecracks, this feels less like an attempt to hang plenty of setpieces on a flimsy plot and more like the action is being dictated by the story. Definitely one of the better modern Bond outings.There's not much new in the two-disc Ultimate Edition to justify an upgrade though. While the extras from the previous release have been carried over, there's only a Hong Kong press conference and a few deleted and alternate scenes. Of these - including Renard's very unimpressive original entrance, more tomfoolery in Q's lab and a line about madmen in hollowed out volcanoes filled with large breasted women threatening the world with nuclear war (""It only takes one"") among them - only a visually striking scene in the abandoned oilfields seems good enough to have kept.",4,Bond back on good form,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2732,"['disappointment', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Days', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'too', 'surprising', 'that', 'usual', 'EON', 'pattern', 'alternating', 'good', 'bad', 'Bond', 'films', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'turned', 'out', 'rather', 'well', 'stronger', 'plot', 'time', 'round', 'as', 'well', 'attempt', 'element', 'mystery', 'Eyes', 'Only', 'only', 'Bond', 'where', 'identity', 'real', 'villain', 'withheld', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'also', 'more', 'character-based', 'usual', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'different', 'dimension', 'know', 'who', 'side', 'angels', 'who', ""n't"", 'Maguffin', 'oil-based', 'variation', 'Goldfinger', 'big', 'scheme', 'execution', 'very', 'different', 'rather', 'more', 'grounded', 'Brosnan', 'best', 'character', 'writing', 'tenure', ""n't"", 'always', 'up', 'moments', 'ruthlessness', 'convince', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'still', 'just', 'be', 'always', 'do', 'something', 'making', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'ADDS', 'scenes', 'couple', 'strange', 'bits', 'gurning', 'can', 'still', 'lay', 'claim', 'being', 'best', 'performance', 'role', 'presence', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'raise', 'acting', 'bar', 'enough', 'even', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'hot', 'pant', 'wearing', 'nuclear', 'scientist', 'in-joke', 'casting', 'finest', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'been', 'slightly', 'schizoid', 'feel', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'direction', 'times', 'seeming', 'tad', 'uncertain', 'stylistically', 'very', 'different', 'Vic', 'Armstrong', 'action', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'not', 'difficult', 'tell', 'who', 'shot', 'what', 'not', 'just', 'Armstrong', 'better', 'hiding', 'significant', 'height', 'difference', 'Brosnan', 'Carlyle', 'still', 'variable', 'opening', 'boat', 'chase', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'sight', 'gags', 'helicopter/chainsaw', 'sequence', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'handled', 'time', 'round', 'much', 'better', 'integrated', 'story', 'awful', 'wisecracks', 'less', 'attempt', 'hang', 'plenty', 'setpieces', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'more', 'action', 'being', 'dictated', 'story', 'Definitely', 'one', 'better', 'modern', 'Bond', 'not', 'much', 'new', 'two-disc', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', 'justify', 'upgrade', 'though', 'extras', 'previous', 'release', 'have', 'been', 'carried', 'only', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'press', 'conference', 'few', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'including', 'Renard', 'very', 'unimpressive', 'original', 'entrance', 'more', 'tomfoolery', 'Q', 'lab', 'line', 'madmen', 'hollowed', 'out', 'volcanoes', 'filled', 'large', 'breasted', 'women', 'threatening', 'world', 'nuclear', 'war', 'only', 'one', 'only', 'visually', 'striking', 'scene', 'abandoned', 'oilfields', 'good', 'enough', 'have', 'kept']",The World Is Not Enough VHS
478081,A243HY69GIAHFI,6305784906,tropic_of_criticism,"[4, 6]","TWINE is the continuation of a welcome trend in the Bond series.  Like the two other Brosnan films before it, TWINE sees the improving fortunes of Oscar (tm) winner Dame Judi Dench take Universal Exports along for the  ride.  No longer is M a `bookend' character; here she-and the whole of  MI6-are integral to the plot.  Indeed, it's not just that Judi Dench  herself has grown her own role, it's that there has come a realization at  EON Studios that there is a need to create a tapestry of recurring  characters with whom Bond works.  Hence we see here the creation of an MI6  team, including the return of _Goldeneye_'s Tanner, who, though until  recently ignored in the movies, was an important, recurring character in  the books.The practical result is that M's traditional role of mission  setup has been farmed out to her subordinates, and her screen time is  mostly devoted to the development of an actual relationship with Bond.  The  consequent chemistry between Judi Dench and Pierce Brosnan is electrifying  in an unusual filmic way.  It may be the first big budget male/female  pairing where sex is not at issue, the woman is in a position of power, and  the man has no fear of losing his job for speaking frankly.  It's a  delicious mix which allows the two performers license to smoulder.It  also gives M an uncommon chance to become a part of the emotional, and not  just factual, set up of the movie.  Her reaction to the fruit of her  loyalties-indeed, to the field consequences of her orders--is at the very  heart of the movie.  Never have we seen an M show us actual regret about a  mission before, and it lends for the first time an air of credible  ambiguity to the invincibility of the Double-0 section.Moving away from  the film's emotional core, however, there are problems.The opening  sequence is ultimately unsatisfying.  I wasn't sure at first if my  displeasure came from the editing of the piece, or the length of it, but  subsequent viewings have convinced me it's the just the very ending which  is unsuitable.  This is maybe the only Bond opening where Bond is  essentially defeated before the titles.  And that's a good thing: director  Michael Apted was trying to push the Bond format in different directions.  Showing Bond as vulnerable works.  But to leave us with that defeat  unrebutted by Bond making a joke leaves the scene unclosed.  Thus, we go  into the titles much too abruptly, and we wonder, if only for a second,  `Was that a good teaser or not?'  Just those few more moments of closure  would've left us totally happy with what is in every other regard a  beautiful thing.By contrast, beauty is the only thing that Denise  Richards has going for her.  Denise Richards' dismal performance is an  obvious earsore-but more than that, the need for her character to be  romantically linked to Bond is unclear.  Surely the formula calls for Bond  to end up with a girl at the end of the film, but this feels somehow like  he just ended up with *any* girl.  Given the complexity of his main  romantic relationship in the picture, Denise Richards' character becomes a  cheap, badly-acted gimmick that insults the careful characterization given  to the film's real female leads, M and Electra.Fortunately these are but  aberrations on an otherwise excellent entry to the Bond series.  The return  of Robbie Coltrane, the Central Asian locations, the relevant (but  critically maligned) oil plot, and the interesting psychology of the  Electra-Renard-Bond-M quadrangle all conspire to give us a Bond experience  worth buying.  It can only be hoped that Brosnan will take his contractual  option for a fourth film-and that he'll bring MI6 back to life for  us.(DVD notes: Like other Special Editions, this is a feature-rich DVD.  Don't even think about buying on VHS if you have the DVD option.  Unlike  most other Special Editions, the director's commentary is made without the  sometimes annoying presence of the Ian Fleming Society's interviewer.  This  is a straight-up running commentary and it's definitely the better for it.  Apted's a fascinating director, and it's more than interesting to hear him  talk about the choices he made.)",5,Three Brosnan Bonds is not enough,959817600,"06 1, 2000",2000,4182,"['TWINE', 'continuation', 'welcome', 'trend', 'Bond', 'series', 'two', 'other', 'Brosnan', 'films', 'TWINE', 'improving', 'fortunes', 'Oscar', 'tm', 'winner', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'take', 'Universal', 'Exports', 'ride', 'No', 'longer', 'M', 'bookend', 'character', 'here', 'she-and', 'whole', 'MI6-are', 'integral', 'plot', 'Indeed', 'not', 'just', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'grown', 'own', 'role', 'come', 'realization', 'EON', 'Studios', 'need', 'create', 'tapestry', 'recurring', 'characters', 'whom', 'Bond', 'works', 'Hence', 'see', 'here', 'creation', 'MI6', 'team', 'including', 'return', '_Goldeneye_', 'Tanner', 'who', 'recently', 'ignored', 'movies', 'was', 'important', 'recurring', 'character', 'books.The', 'practical', 'result', 'M', 'traditional', 'role', 'mission', 'setup', 'been', 'farmed', 'subordinates', 'screen', 'time', 'mostly', 'devoted', 'development', 'actual', 'relationship', 'Bond', 'consequent', 'chemistry', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'electrifying', 'unusual', 'filmic', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'big', 'budget', 'male/female', 'pairing', 'where', 'sex', 'not', 'issue', 'woman', 'position', 'power', 'man', 'fear', 'losing', 'job', 'speaking', 'frankly', 'delicious', 'mix', 'two', 'performers', 'license', 'smoulder.It', 'also', 'M', 'uncommon', 'chance', 'become', 'part', 'emotional', 'not', 'just', 'factual', 'set', 'movie', 'reaction', 'fruit', 'loyalties-indeed', 'field', 'consequences', 'orders', 'very', 'heart', 'movie', 'Never', 'have', 'seen', 'M', 'show', 'actual', 'regret', 'mission', 'first', 'time', 'air', 'credible', 'ambiguity', 'invincibility', 'Double-0', 'section.Moving', 'away', 'film', 'emotional', 'core', 'however', 'are', 'problems.The', 'opening', 'sequence', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'first', 'displeasure', 'came', 'editing', 'piece', 'length', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'have', 'convinced', 'just', 'very', 'ending', 'unsuitable', 'maybe', 'only', 'Bond', 'opening', 'where', 'Bond', 'essentially', 'defeated', 'titles', 'good', 'thing', 'director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'was', 'trying', 'push', 'Bond', 'format', 'different', 'directions', 'Showing', 'Bond', 'vulnerable', 'works', 'leave', 'defeat', 'unrebutted', 'Bond', 'making', 'joke', 'scene', 'unclosed', 'Thus', 'go', 'titles', 'much', 'too', 'abruptly', 'wonder', 'only', 'second', 'Was', 'good', 'teaser', 'not', 'Just', 'few', 'more', 'moments', 'closure', 'would', ""'ve"", 'left', 'totally', 'happy', 'what', 'other', 'regard', 'beautiful', 'thing.By', 'contrast', 'beauty', 'only', 'thing', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'going', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'dismal', 'performance', 'obvious', 'earsore-but', 'more', 'need', 'character', 'be', 'romantically', 'linked', 'Bond', 'unclear', 'Surely', 'formula', 'Bond', 'end', 'up', 'girl', 'end', 'film', 'somehow', 'just', 'ended', 'up', '*any*', 'girl', 'Given', 'complexity', 'main', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'picture', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'character', 'cheap', 'badly-acted', 'gimmick', 'careful', 'characterization', 'given', 'film', 'real', 'female', 'leads', 'M', 'Electra.Fortunately', 'are', 'aberrations', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'entry', 'Bond', 'series', 'return', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Central', 'Asian', 'locations', 'relevant', 'critically', 'maligned', 'oil', 'plot', 'interesting', 'psychology', 'Electra-Renard-Bond-M', 'quadrangle', 'conspire', 'give', 'Bond', 'experience', 'worth', 'buying', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'hoped', 'Brosnan', 'will', 'take', 'contractual', 'option', 'fourth', 'film-and', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'MI6', 'back', 'life', 'DVD', 'notes', 'other', 'Special', 'Editions', 'feature-rich', 'DVD', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'buying', 'VHS', 'have', 'DVD', 'option', 'most', 'other', 'Special', 'Editions', 'director', 'commentary', 'made', 'sometimes', 'annoying', 'presence', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'Society', 'interviewer', 'straight-up', 'running', 'commentary', 'definitely', 'better', 'Apted', 'fascinating', 'director', 'more', 'interesting', 'hear', 'talk', 'choices', 'made']",The World Is Not Enough VHS
478082,AN9TLUKFAJHP8,6305784906,Tung Yin,"[0, 2]","After two outstanding entries (&quot;Goldeneye&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;) in the James Bond series, Pierce Brosnan's third going, &quot;The World is Not Enough,&quot; is certainly ambitious in acting and  characterization.  Bond exhibits a dark and (generally) amoral streak  throughout the movie; there are at least two people that he kills in  instances that would have been shocking in most other Bond movies with the  possible exception of the early Sean Connery ones.No doubt director  Michael Apted had something to do with the deeper layers of  characterization; Apted previously directed the &quot;7-Up&quot;  documentary series, as well as the ambitious (but disappointing)  &quot;Thunderheart.&quot;The set pieces throughout &quot;The World is  Not Enough&quot; are terrific, ranging from a boat chase through London, a  ski sequence involving &quot;para-hawks,&quot; a long sequence at a  refinery dock with giant circular saw blade armed helicopters, and numerous  brutal gunfights and fistfights.  Brosnan reportedly did many of his own  stunts, and indeed, Bond is more spectacularly violent here than in recent  films.The biggest problem with the movie (aside from the inherent  laughable premise of Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist) is that too  much of it makes no sense.  Now it may be that I've been dumbed down by too  many movies, but there were multiple instances while watching this that  Bond would struggle to take some action and I would be left wondering why  he was doing what he was doing.  At 2 hours and 8 minutes, the movie may  have been as long as the studio would have allowed it to be, but one gets  the sense that another five minutes or so scattered throughout might have  helped make things make more sense.Equally problematic is the fact that  the villain, who is described as being impervious to pain due to the  lodging of a bullet near his brain, goes around doing things like grasping  hot coals in his hand.  Sure, maybe he wouldn't feel any pain, but his hand  should still be burned and structurally damaged.  That sort of damage  should affect his ability to grasp objects (like guns) and affect his  ability to use his hands (for things like shooting guns).Finally, a note  on the special features of the DVD.  The DVD proudly advertises its  &quot;video options,&quot; allowing you to catch behind the scene looks of  certain scenes.  Those of you who own &quot;The Matrix&quot; on DVD will  think that this is similar to the &quot;Follow the White Rabbit&quot;  feature on that disc.  Indeed, at designated scenes in &quot;The World is  Not Enough,&quot; a white &quot;007&quot; flashes on the screen.

He has become too much of an action hero in the Rambo sense for my liking. I didn't like the story of this one, and the evil villan was very weak in terms of portrayal. We get an impression of how frightening and powerful this villan is through what other characters say and do, but when we see him ourselves, he is rather disappointing! It is not all the fault of the actor, even though he does not have the physical stature to carry off such a role. This is made even more acute by the fact that there is a great build up where we are told that he is just getting stronger and stronger until the day he dies, but it isn't really followed up with the dramatic ending that it could have been. Very run'o the mill, in fact. Also, he bore too much of a resemblence to Blofeld to be convincing in his own right. Somehing went wrong with this Bond movie.

This film is character driven.  The actions follow the intricate plot in revealing dark, unexpected motives.  The actions, explosions, threats, and character dynamics do not seem to be scripted or contrived.These villains are complex and shrewd, and the seductive Elektra is capable of capturing Bond's heart.  The reasons for Elektra and Rinard's actions are plausible and more human than in other Bond films.  It does not necessarily make them sympathetic, but there is a great sense of loss captured in the scenes between Rinard and Elektra.The action scenes are complex and should be viewed more than once to enjoy the full impact.  I am a Bond fan, so I always see the movies more than three times.  The character development in this film gave depth that has been missing in James Bond.  He is human and does care deeply, but he will not let emotions control him.  This makes Pierce Brosnan's Bond equal to Sean Connery's -- and I can think of no higher compliment.The DVD features are excellent.  Commentaries, interviews, and a music video that is exotic, erotic, and seductive, as any James Bond love theme should be.  The band Garbage takes us on an incredible journey to a high tech world where a beautiful female android is created.  Her kiss of death and the song makes it is easy to see similarities to the plot.Since this was released in late 1999, I am looking for another 007 movie with Pierce Brosnan soon.  I do hope that Michael Apted will be the director.This is a top-notch film worth watching again.  I will watch the commentaries several times and definitely the music video; it is 5 stars.Victoria Tarrani",5,"Bond in love is a new twist, and it works.",993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,1823,"['can', 'always', 'count', '007', 'James', 'Bond', 'take', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'quot', 'World', 'not', 'Enough', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'deeper', 'side', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'character', 'driven', 'actions', 'follow', 'intricate', 'plot', 'revealing', 'dark', 'unexpected', 'motives', 'actions', 'explosions', 'threats', 'character', 'dynamics', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'scripted', 'contrived.These', 'villains', 'are', 'complex', 'shrewd', 'seductive', 'Elektra', 'capable', 'capturing', 'Bond', 'heart', 'reasons', 'Elektra', 'Rinard', 'actions', 'are', 'plausible', 'more', 'human', 'other', 'Bond', 'films', 'not', 'necessarily', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'great', 'sense', 'loss', 'captured', 'scenes', 'Rinard', 'Elektra.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'complex', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'more', 'once', 'enjoy', 'full', 'impact', 'am', 'Bond', 'fan', 'always', 'see', 'movies', 'more', 'three', 'times', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'gave', 'depth', 'been', 'missing', 'James', 'Bond', 'human', 'care', 'deeply', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'emotions', 'control', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Bond', 'equal', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'can', 'think', 'higher', 'compliment.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'excellent', 'Commentaries', 'interviews', 'music', 'video', 'exotic', 'erotic', 'seductive', 'James', 'Bond', 'love', 'theme', 'should', 'be', 'band', 'Garbage', 'incredible', 'journey', 'high', 'tech', 'world', 'where', 'beautiful', 'female', 'android', 'created', 'kiss', 'death', 'song', 'easy', 'see', 'similarities', 'plot.Since', 'was', 'released', 'late', '1999', 'am', 'looking', '007', 'movie', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'soon', 'do', 'hope', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'will', 'be', 'director.This', 'top-notch', 'film', 'watching', 'again', 'will', 'watch', 'commentaries', 'several', 'times', 'definitely', 'music', 'video', '5', 'stars.Victoria', 'Tarrani']",The World Is Not Enough VHS

Sadly, after an incredible ""first act"", the second half of the film drags it down almost two whole stars.For a basic plot summary, ""World"" sees Bond (Brosnan) up against the Russian baddie Renard (Robert Carlyle) for control over a key oil pipeline.  Along the way, Bond runs into a few beauties (Sophie Marceau & Denise Richards), gets his orders from M (Judi Dench), and receives the gadgets from Q (Desmond Llewelyn).The first half of the film is some of the best Bond action ever.  Brosnan is incredibly slick, his chemistry with Marceau is palpable, and the action is full-throttle without being over-the-top.  Basically, Bond is firing on all cylinders.However, when Renard is introduced (and proves to be nothing ever close to menacing) this film takes a sharp nosedive.  Only adding to the misery is the terrible acting from Richards.  I know that Bond girls are usually ""seen but not heard"", so to speak, but I think one can say that Richards is the worst of the worst by quite a large margin.Overall, ""The World Is Not Enough"" is a very fun Bond outing until it nosedives about halfway through.
