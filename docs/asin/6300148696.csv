Recently, I found this DVD version and it is still enjoyable although the print is poor and sound pretty mushy. It was made about 1934 and sound was problematic in those days anyway. The story is of a Scottish laird who is more interested in romancing girls than fighting in the war and, as a result, gets blown up. The accidental death is handled with a bit of heavy handed humor and a rival clan is implicated in the event. The ghost of the laird is ordered by his departed father to remain haunting the castle until he revenges the family honor on a descendent of the offending rival clan. This is greatly complicated by the sale of the castle by the last of the family who is broke and glad to be rid of it. The castle is dismantled and shipped to Florida accompanied by the ghost. Robert Donat plays both parts and the romantic interest, the daughter of the rich businessman who buys the castle, is played by a pretty actress I have not seen in anything else. One novelty is a thin and pretty Elsa Lancaster, playing a small part.

197014,A16QODENBJVUI1,6300148696,Robert Moore,"[15, 15]","Of all the great European directors who came to Hollywood in the thirties and forties, Ren&eacute; Clair may have enjoyed the most successful exile, directing the classics I MARRIED A WITCH and AND THEN THERE WERE NONE.  But, before traveling from Paris over the Atlantic to the New World, Clair enjoyed a brief sojourn in Great Britain, where he made this marvelous and unjustly neglected comedy.The plot is simple:  a land rich/cash poor Scotsman sells the family castle to a rich American millionaire, who has the castle moved to the US stone by stone.  The difficulty is that the castle is haunted, and the ghost moves with the castle to its new locale.  We therefore get a ghost fantasy with a different twist:  a ghost has to deal with culture shock.For me, three things make this film stand out.  First, Robert Donat is marvelous as the ghost/impoverished seller.  Had Donat lived later in the 20th century, he would have been far, far more successful as an actor, and infinitely more active.  Donat suffered from nearly debilitating asthma condition that severely limited his screen appearances (as well as some serious stage fright, or, in this case, screen fright).  This performance is one of his finest.  Second, Eugene Pallette enjoys one of his greatest roles.  Pallette is perhaps best known as Friar Tuck in the Errol Flynn THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, and almost as well known in THE LADY EVE and MY MAN GODFREY.  He actually appeared in a vast number of films from the beginning of the silent era all the way to his death in 1946.  Yet, his major roles were relatively few.  I find his stern scowl, rotund physique, and softhearted core to be enchanting.  The third reason the film succeeds is the deft and light-hearted direction of Ren&eacute; Clair.  Partly because he suffered a sharp post-WW II decline, Clair is not as fondly remembered as he ought to be.  He directed the two Hollywood classic I mentioned above, but was even better in the early 1930s, directing in France such masterpieces as SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS and &Agrave; NOUS LA LIBERTE, as well as one of my all time favorite films, the utterly delightful musical LE MILLION.",5,"A marvelous, enchanting fantasy-comedy",1033776000,"10 5, 2002",2002,2162,"['great', 'European', 'directors', 'who', 'came', 'Hollywood', 'thirties', 'forties', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Clair', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'successful', 'exile', 'directing', 'classics', 'MARRIED', 'WITCH', 'AND', 'THEN', 'THERE', 'WERE', 'NONE', 'traveling', 'Paris', 'Atlantic', 'New', 'World', 'Clair', 'enjoyed', 'brief', 'sojourn', 'Great', 'Britain', 'where', 'made', 'marvelous', 'unjustly', 'neglected', 'comedy.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'land', 'rich/cash', 'poor', 'Scotsman', 'family', 'castle', 'rich', 'American', 'millionaire', 'who', 'castle', 'moved', 'US', 'stone', 'stone', 'difficulty', 'castle', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'moves', 'castle', 'new', 'locale', 'therefore', 'get', 'ghost', 'fantasy', 'different', 'twist', 'ghost', 'deal', 'culture', 'shock.For', 'three', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'First', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'marvelous', 'ghost/impoverished', 'seller', 'Had', 'Donat', 'lived', 'later', '20th', 'century', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'actor', 'infinitely', 'more', 'active', 'Donat', 'suffered', 'nearly', 'debilitating', 'asthma', 'condition', 'severely', 'limited', 'screen', 'appearances', 'as', 'well', 'serious', 'stage', 'fright', 'case', 'screen', 'fright', 'performance', 'one', 'finest', 'Second', 'Eugene', 'Pallette', 'one', 'greatest', 'roles', 'Pallette', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'Friar', 'Tuck', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'THE', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'ROBIN', 'HOOD', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'THE', 'LADY', 'EVE', 'MY', 'MAN', 'GODFREY', 'actually', 'appeared', 'vast', 'number', 'films', 'beginning', 'silent', 'era', 'way', 'death', '1946', 'major', 'roles', 'were', 'relatively', 'few', 'find', 'stern', 'scowl', 'rotund', 'physique', 'softhearted', 'core', 'be', 'enchanting', 'third', 'reason', 'film', 'deft', 'light-hearted', 'direction', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Clair', 'Partly', 'suffered', 'sharp', 'post-WW', 'II', 'decline', 'Clair', 'not', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'ought', 'be', 'directed', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'classic', 'mentioned', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'early', '1930s', 'directing', 'France', 'such', 'masterpieces', 'SOUS', 'LES', 'TOITS', 'DE', 'PARIS', 'Agrave', 'NOUS', 'LA', 'LIBERTE', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'films', 'utterly', 'delightful', 'musical', 'LE', 'MILLION']",The Ghost Goes West VHS
