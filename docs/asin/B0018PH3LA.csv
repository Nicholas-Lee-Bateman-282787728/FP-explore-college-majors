I am in a sorority and it is absolutely NOTHING like this movie.  And the fact that someone dies right in the beginning because she doesn't look like a model is really messed up.,3,Kinda Eh...,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,273,"['movie', 'was', 'sort', 'boring', 'places', 'overbearing', 'sorority', 'girl', 'image', 'times', 'am', 'sorority', 'absolutely', 'NOTHING', 'movie', 'fact', 'someone', 'dies', 'right', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'look', 'model', 'really', 'messed', 'up']",Legacy

I thought it brought exactly what I expected, mean sorority girls and brainless humor, all wrapped up in a pink package called Legacy. I think some people on here took this film way to seriously, in no way was it supposed to be a moving, life changing piece of cinema, and I thought the writing was a fairly accurate depiction of sorority life yet also highly exaggerated. The whole film is an exaggeration...including the blond wig. To me it seems its on purpose, in fact I think Hailey's character even makes a comment about her hair falling out. If you are headed to blockbuster and want to laugh and be entertained, this is the movie for you. To me its what happens when Heathers meets Super Bad.",5,Loved it!,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,726,"['really', 'liked', 'film', 'thought', 'brought', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'mean', 'sorority', 'girls', 'brainless', 'humor', 'wrapped', 'up', 'pink', 'package', 'called', 'Legacy', 'think', 'people', 'here', 'took', 'film', 'way', 'seriously', 'way', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'moving', 'life', 'changing', 'piece', 'cinema', 'thought', 'writing', 'was', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'sorority', 'life', 'yet', 'also', 'highly', 'exaggerated', 'whole', 'film', 'exaggeration', 'including', 'blond', 'wig', 'purpose', 'fact', 'think', 'Hailey', 'character', 'even', 'comment', 'hair', 'falling', 'out', 'are', 'headed', 'blockbuster', 'want', 'laugh', 'be', 'entertained', 'movie', 'what', 'when', 'Heathers', 'Super', 'Bad']",Legacy
