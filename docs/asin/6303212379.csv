The high points of this edition are an inventive and colorful selection menu, the excellent transfer print of the film used, and the feature-length audio commentary, which reunites the entire child-star cast of the film! They've even gone so far as to include both parts of the promotional Cindy Lauper &quot;Its Good Enough&quot; video that ran its course back in the good-old days, when MTV played music videos.The DVD is far from perfect, however, and there are a few minor disappointments. First, the audio commentary occasional switches from the movie to an in-studio shot of the actors discussing the film, which I personally found a bit distracting, although others may disagree. And while they take great pains to show the cast members talking, there are no filmographies or bios included in the Cast &amp; Crew section, an excellent opportunity for a &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; moment. Finally, while some deleted scenes are included with the extras, the cast invariably makes mention throughout the commentary of numerous scenes filmed that are not shown, even in rough form. Its always a let-down when a seven-hour rough cut is alluded to, yet only five minutes worth of deleted scenes (and no outtakes) make it onto the disc.But these are all minor complaints, and in no way detract from one of the greatest kid's films ever made!

I went into the theater and saw The Goonies. What a ride. What a summer. I saw it in the theater 2 or times. I would of seen it again if my dad hadn't persuaded me to try another new movie that just came out. A certain Zemeckis movie about a teenage boy who goes back in time and see his parents when they were his age. Like I said, what a summer!. The Goonies is a special and magical film for all those who were lucky enough to witness it in it's original release. How many of us have had our group of childhood friends who would play, pretend, and just be kids?. How many of us would dream and fantasize of being a superhero, or a pirate, or going on great adventures?. Well, with The Goonies, it's all there. It hits close to home for me not just because of the times and how nostalgic it was, but because it spoke to me. I could of been a Goonie. The film follows a group of Oregon kids(The Goonies) who stumble upon an old treasure map leading to the treasure of pirate One Eye Willie. The kids see it as a way of possibly saving their homes from destruction. From then on, our fearless kids begin their search that leads them thru tunnels, face to face with gun toting criminals, and trying to survive deadly booby traps. It's a wonderful adventure for everyone. The cast is phenomenal. From Sean Astin to Corey Feldman to Jeff Cohen, these are real kids. They seem to really be friends. They all have their own quirks and personalities, and the kids are so talented to pull it all off. The dialogue is sharp and funny, and it always sounds genuine and just ""right"". What is also great about the film is that it has an ""edge"" to it. A certain darkness just underneath that doesn't make it 100% squeaky clean. Some curse words and a corpse helping. The bad guys, The Fratellis, are an interesting bunch. Both seriously menacing and cartoonish at the same time. And really, who didn't want a Sloth of their own after seeing the film?. Some people and critics complain that nostalgic kids from the 80's make the movie out to be better than it is. Maybe, but the movie IS good. Sometimes the hype from it's life long fans are justified. This is one of them. It's funny, it's wild, it has engaging and relatable characters, and it's just...magic. The commentary has all the kids and director Richard Donner, and what's great is that the film will go to a box in the corner and actually show the entire cast sitting there watching while they record the commentary.

Some of the scenes looked familiar like I'd seen bits and pieces of the film in the past, but I don't think I ever sat down and actually watched it the entire way through.  This is hard to believe considering I spent my entire childhood in the 80's.Well, for the most part it's a family/adventure type film involving a group of troublemaker kids around 10-years old and going on an enormous adventure.  It's funny whenever the kids think they're doing something they'll be grounded for, it's actually mild compared to things kids do in reality.As you can tell, adventure movies came a long way since the Goonies- just look at Harry Potter for example. Two completely different films perhaps, but both putting heavy emphasis on the adventurous aspect of the storytelling.Anyway, this movie aged somewhat well. You can definitely tell it was released in the mid 80's, and my goodness, Anne Ramsey is one of the scariest women of all time! I mean that as a compliment- she'd immediately scare *any* troublemaker child straight just by looking at them with that mean expression on her face!  I remember her fondly throughout the 80's- rest in peace.  A terrific actress she was.This is a pretty good film. I'm surprised it's popular enough to have received 500 reviews here on amazon, but I guess it's easy to see why- it's a fun flick.  Perhaps the Goonies is more important than I'm giving it credit for and it's considered either a perfect timepiece of the 80's, or I'm just underrating its overall popularity, or maybe it's a major influence on something.

""The Goonies"" does that for alot of people in my generation. The cool thing about this flick is, not only does it take you back, but, once there, it captures so wonderfully what the best moments of being a kid felt like. Yes, the plot is mostly a fantasy-the ultimate wish fulfillment of having a great adventure, and saving the day. However, the soul of the movie-why it's still cherished today-is it's understanding of friendship and family. ""Stand By Me"" is the only other film that has so accurate a portrait of adolescent boys interacting with each other. The cast had such an amazing chemistry. Great direction by Richard Donner, and this is Spielberg magic in it's prime. This fantastic DVD presentation does the film justice.

They did this since their home was to be destroyed by greedy land developers who wants to build a golf course.

We then have just a glimmer of hope that they won't have to leave. (If they can find an old pirate's treasure.) Now what is interesting here is that the hope revolves around a willingness to believe again as a child.Now what is interesting here is that the 4 young friends set off on this journey together, and gradually, Sean Astin's older brother, his possible girl friend, and her friend join the party. (The party started with 4 young children, and 3 older people ended up joining the party.)They go through an interesting series of caves filled with traps in hopes of saving their homes. What is especially interesting here is that no one is there without a purpose. (Corey Feldman knows Spanish and can read the map; Data has some gadgets that may prove useful; Andy can play the keyboard at a crucial time; Brandon is a little older, so he may be acquainted with some dangers the younger crew is not ready for, etc.Of course, we can't have it that easy. They are later persued by 3 The Fratellis who are very bad. But they carry a charm that makes them likable despite their crimes.  A signature moment is when one of the Fratellis complains that his mother always liked the other son better, and then she slaps him and says: ""That's right.""An especially funny moment with the Fratellis is when they want their prisoner Chunk to tell them EVERYTHING about the hidden treasure, but he takes it literally, and tells them every bad thing he ever did. And one of them gets interested in Chunk's confessions and responds: ""I'm starting to like this kid.""While the movie may seem simple, it is never boring. And the delightful interaction of the characters who aren't exactly experts, but who all have something to contribute to this journey may very well thrust this movie into the classics.It is emotionally enduring; funny; suspenseful; and full of adventure.

A Film that shaped Many a Childhood, including mine, and Still holds the title of the Best Kid's Adventure film Ever.The amount of Big name Talent behind the scenes is Phenomenal. Richard Donner is in the Directors Chair; Steven Spielberg came up with the Story and Produced it while Chris Columbus wrote the Screenplay. Rarely is a film in Such Good Hands.My Favourite Scenes are Too Numerous to List, but I Will Anyway. Firstly we have the Spectacular opening Prison Escape and Car Chase, then the ""Truffle Shuffle"" scene (I Think that's how you Pronounce it), Mouth showing Rosalita around the house, the gang escaping from Brand (Data: ""Hey Brand, how far can you stretch that?), Mouth causing Chunk to open the door of the Restaurant, the gangs first ""Sloth"" encounter (Chunk: ""Sounds like Kong""), the Fertelli's picking up Chunk (Chunk: ""In Third grade I cheated on my History exam, In Forth grade...""). All that takes place in the films first half, for those who haven't seen it... I'm Telling you, you Don't know what your Missing Out on.Many Childhood favourites lose their Shine as one grows Older, but my Love for ""The Goonies"" just gets Stronger and Stronger as the years go by.

363820,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,6303212379,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 2]","Brainchild of cinematic genius Steven Spielberg, The Goonies is a thrilling fantasy adventure film for younger audiences - although adults will find it enjoyable as well. Foreshadowing the success of the Harry Potter films, The Goonies involves a series of tests and obstacles that a group of young kids must overcome in order to save the day. In a lot of ways, the film is like an Indiana Jones for kids - produced in such a way that kids can envision or fantasize about being in just such a situation.The film follows the exploits of a neighborhood group of kids who call themselves The Goonies. Upset that they will soon have to part ways because of the forced commercial development of their neighborhood, the kids are enjoying what they believe will be one of their last meetings together.But while Mikey, Chunk, Mouth, and Data (the nicknames of the Goonies respectively) are exploring Mikey's attic, they find a treasure map hidden in the back of an old picture frame. Purportedly, the map leads to the long lost treasure of the famous pirate ""One-Eyed"" Willy. Banding together with Mikey's older brother Brandon and two neighborhood girls, Andy and Stef, the group sets out to uncover the pirate's vast riches and thus save their homes from the wrath of the wrecking ball.But a small problem stands in their way. The treasure map's starting point rests underneath an old abandoned house used as a hideout by the notorious Fratelli crime family. Brothers Jake and Francis, coupled with their deformed yet gentle brother and mean Mama Fratelli, are quite an intimidating force. When the Goonies manage to uncover the entrance to the cave that harbors their treasure, Chunk is left behind. The Fratelli's viciously interrogate the boy in an effort to find out what happened to his friends. But it takes a freak accident (spilled water falling down the hole in the fireplace) before they find One-Eyed Willy's secret passage.With the Fratelli family hot on their heals, the Goonies must pass through a series of mental and physical obstacles set up centuries before by pirates intent on keeping undesirables away from their precious bounty. Interspersed in the action is a number of clever and humorous one-liners that add to the overall audience enjoyment of the film.In the end, the kids discover One-Eyed Willy's monstrous treasure. But can they stave off the greedy ambitions of the Fratelli family? Will they manage to save their neighborhood with the newfound treasure? You'll have to watch to find out, and trust me, this movie is a lot of fun...Each of the stars contributes to the film in his own way. Chunk provides many moments of comic relief with his endless whining, and Data's constant deployment of quirky homemade inventions, although stretching the limits of reality, are a welcome addition to a fantasy adventure film tailored for a young audience.With the introduction of The Goonies DVD, an entirely new generation can discover the thrill and wonder of this instant cinema classic. Given its wide range of appeal to audiences of all ages and the exciting quest for hidden treasure, The Goonies passes the test as a definite must-see film. If you haven't seen it, or even worse - if your children have been deprived of seeing it - then I highly recommend renting this one...The DVD Report",5,Indiana Jones for kids...,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,3312,"['Brainchild', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Goonies', 'thrilling', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'film', 'younger', 'audiences', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'well', 'Foreshadowing', 'success', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'Goonies', 'series', 'tests', 'obstacles', 'group', 'young', 'kids', 'must', 'overcome', 'order', 'save', 'day', 'lot', 'ways', 'film', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'kids', 'produced', 'such', 'way', 'kids', 'can', 'envision', 'fantasize', 'being', 'just', 'situation.The', 'film', 'exploits', 'neighborhood', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'call', 'Goonies', 'Upset', 'will', 'soon', 'have', 'part', 'ways', 'forced', 'commercial', 'development', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'are', 'enjoying', 'what', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'last', 'meetings', 'together.But', 'Mikey', 'Chunk', 'Mouth', 'Data', 'nicknames', 'Goonies', 'respectively', 'are', 'exploring', 'Mikey', 'attic', 'find', 'treasure', 'map', 'hidden', 'back', 'old', 'picture', 'frame', 'Purportedly', 'map', 'long', 'lost', 'treasure', 'famous', 'pirate', 'One-Eyed', 'Willy', 'Banding', 'together', 'Mikey', 'older', 'brother', 'Brandon', 'two', 'neighborhood', 'girls', 'Andy', 'Stef', 'group', 'out', 'uncover', 'pirate', 'vast', 'riches', 'thus', 'save', 'homes', 'wrath', 'wrecking', 'ball.But', 'small', 'problem', 'stands', 'way', 'treasure', 'map', 'starting', 'point', 'rests', 'underneath', 'old', 'abandoned', 'house', 'used', 'hideout', 'notorious', 'Fratelli', 'crime', 'family', 'Brothers', 'Jake', 'Francis', 'coupled', 'deformed', 'yet', 'gentle', 'brother', 'mean', 'Mama', 'Fratelli', 'are', 'quite', 'intimidating', 'force', 'When', 'Goonies', 'manage', 'uncover', 'entrance', 'cave', 'treasure', 'Chunk', 'left', 'Fratelli', 'viciously', 'interrogate', 'boy', 'effort', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'friends', 'freak', 'accident', 'spilled', 'water', 'falling', 'down', 'hole', 'fireplace', 'find', 'One-Eyed', 'Willy', 'secret', 'passage.With', 'Fratelli', 'family', 'hot', 'heals', 'Goonies', 'must', 'pass', 'series', 'mental', 'physical', 'obstacles', 'set', 'up', 'centuries', 'pirates', 'intent', 'keeping', 'undesirables', 'away', 'precious', 'bounty', 'Interspersed', 'action', 'number', 'clever', 'humorous', 'one-liners', 'add', 'overall', 'audience', 'enjoyment', 'film.In', 'end', 'kids', 'discover', 'One-Eyed', 'Willy', 'monstrous', 'treasure', 'can', 'stave', 'off', 'greedy', 'ambitions', 'Fratelli', 'family', 'Will', 'manage', 'save', 'neighborhood', 'newfound', 'treasure', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'trust', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'stars', 'film', 'own', 'way', 'Chunk', 'many', 'moments', 'comic', 'relief', 'endless', 'whining', 'Data', 'constant', 'deployment', 'quirky', 'homemade', 'inventions', 'stretching', 'limits', 'reality', 'are', 'welcome', 'addition', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'film', 'tailored', 'young', 'audience.With', 'introduction', 'Goonies', 'DVD', 'entirely', 'new', 'generation', 'can', 'discover', 'thrill', 'wonder', 'instant', 'cinema', 'classic', 'Given', 'wide', 'range', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'ages', 'exciting', 'quest', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'Goonies', 'test', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'even', 'worse', 'children', 'have', 'been', 'deprived', 'seeing', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'renting', 'one', 'DVD', 'Report']",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS

Once they find the pirate's map in their attic, the wild fun begins as the group is put through many rigorously challanging tasks in their quest.The film moves along at a rapid pace, with excellent acting, witty dialogue, and a nice, cohesive storyline that is fun and easy to follow.  You can't help but cheer for the Goonies to succeed in their search.Besides the entertaining film, the DVD is loaded with some super extras.  A Cyndi Lauper music video, three never-seen-before scenes, and some excellent commentary by some of the actors are just a few of the perks of the DVD.This movie is nothing but fun, and with the help of a super, colorful cast of actors, THE GOONIES is a very enjoyable experience.  It is a pleasure to watch the magic unfold on the screen.  This is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by everyone, especially people with children.",5,&quot;Hey You Guys!&quot;  This DVD Rocks!,1000080000,"09 10, 2001",2001,1404,"['remember', 'watching', 'THE', 'GOONIES', 'child', 'loving', 'Now', 'can', 'share', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'children', 'probably', 'most', 'complete', 'DVD', 'available', 'today.THE', 'GOONIES', 'wonderful', 'story', 'bunch', 'friends', 'experience', 'magical', 'ties', 'bonds', 'friendships', 'classic', 'story', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'did', 'wonderful', 'writing', 'it.A', 'group', 'friends', 'are', 'out', 'search', 'quot', 'One-Eyed', 'quot', 'Willie', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'hopes', 'stopping', 'land', 'developer', 'taking', 'homes', 'find', 'pirate', 'map', 'attic', 'wild', 'fun', 'group', 'put', 'many', 'rigorously', 'challanging', 'tasks', 'quest.The', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'rapid', 'pace', 'excellent', 'acting', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'nice', 'cohesive', 'storyline', 'fun', 'easy', 'follow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheer', 'Goonies', 'succeed', 'search.Besides', 'entertaining', 'film', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'super', 'extras', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'music', 'video', 'three', 'never-seen-before', 'scenes', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'perks', 'DVD.This', 'movie', 'nothing', 'fun', 'help', 'super', 'colorful', 'cast', 'actors', 'THE', 'GOONIES', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'magic', 'unfold', 'screen', 'wonderful', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'especially', 'people', 'children']",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS

We both loved this movie and I am quite sure my son imagined himself being a Goonie, having this wonderful gang of friends, treasure hunting.I think the movie has held up well even though 26 years have gone by since it first came out.  Yes, there are some dated parts of the movie: hair styles, clothes, glasses, bicycles - but overall this is a movie that even in another 26 years, young and old will still enjoy.There is big business vs. small property owner; escaped convicts; young love; bullies; friendship; treasure hunting; pirates; a giant; puzzles to figure out; brotherly competition; and good winning out over evil.  These are all pretty timeless themes.These young actors got a good start in this movie.  Most have gone on to much bigger things. Sean Astin - Samwise Gamgee in the Lord of the Rings trilogy plus many other roles in movies; Josh Brolin - many distinguished roles on TV and movies including ""No Country For Old Men"", ""Milk"", and the remake of ""True Grit""; Jeff Cohen became an entertainment attorney with his own law firm in Beverly Hills; Corey Feldman continued acting on TV, movies, and stage, also is involved in music and is an environmental activist; Kerri Green continued acting on TV and movies, co-founded a movie production company and writes screenplays; Jonathan Ke Quan has continued acting on TV and movies and has worked as a stunt choreographer; Martha Plimpton has been nominated for an Emmy and three Tonys, has continued acting on TV (I still remember the amazing episode of Law and Order: SVU she received the Emmy nomination for and she is currently starring in the FOX sitcom ""Raising Hope""), in movies, in plays,she sings and is considered to be one of the hardest working actors in show business.  With this talented bunch of young talent, is it any wonder that ""The Goonies"" is still standing the test of time and keeping us entertained? Plus Steven Spielberg wrote the story.  Talk about a no-brainer.One note - John Matuszak, ex-NFL Oakland Raiders football player that played ""Sloth"" in the movie, died in 1989 at 38 years old of heart failure caused by drugs and possibly pneumonia.  Tooz lived hard and partied hard but he'll live on in this movie as the scary looking but loving Sloth, friend to Chunk and the rest of the Goonies.",5,"""Sloth love Chunk.""",1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,2416,"['Watching', 'Goonies', 'again', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'good', 'memories', 'watching', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1985', 'oldest', 'son', 'loved', 'movie', 'am', 'quite', 'sure', 'son', 'imagined', 'being', 'Goonie', 'having', 'wonderful', 'gang', 'friends', 'treasure', 'hunting.I', 'think', 'movie', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'even', '26', 'years', 'have', 'gone', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Yes', 'are', 'dated', 'parts', 'movie', 'hair', 'styles', 'clothes', 'glasses', 'bicycles', 'overall', 'movie', 'even', '26', 'years', 'young', 'old', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy.There', 'big', 'business', 'vs.', 'small', 'property', 'owner', 'convicts', 'young', 'love', 'bullies', 'friendship', 'treasure', 'hunting', 'giant', 'puzzles', 'figure', 'out', 'brotherly', 'competition', 'good', 'winning', 'out', 'evil', 'are', 'pretty', 'timeless', 'themes.These', 'young', 'actors', 'got', 'good', 'start', 'movie', 'Most', 'have', 'gone', 'much', 'bigger', 'things', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Samwise', 'Gamgee', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'many', 'other', 'roles', 'movies', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'many', 'distinguished', 'roles', 'TV', 'movies', 'including', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Milk', 'remake', 'True', 'Grit', 'Jeff', 'Cohen', 'became', 'entertainment', 'attorney', 'own', 'law', 'firm', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'continued', 'acting', 'TV', 'movies', 'stage', 'also', 'involved', 'music', 'environmental', 'activist', 'Kerri', 'Green', 'continued', 'acting', 'TV', 'movies', 'co-founded', 'movie', 'production', 'company', 'screenplays', 'Jonathan', 'Ke', 'Quan', 'continued', 'acting', 'TV', 'movies', 'worked', 'stunt', 'choreographer', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'been', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'three', 'Tonys', 'continued', 'acting', 'TV', 'still', 'remember', 'amazing', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'received', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'currently', 'starring', 'FOX', 'sitcom', 'Raising', 'Hope', 'movies', 'plays', 'sings', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'hardest', 'working', 'actors', 'show', 'business', 'talented', 'bunch', 'young', 'talent', 'wonder', 'Goonies', 'still', 'standing', 'test', 'time', 'keeping', 'entertained', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'wrote', 'story', 'Talk', 'no-brainer.One', 'note', 'John', 'Matuszak', 'ex-NFL', 'Oakland', 'Raiders', 'football', 'player', 'played', 'Sloth', 'movie', 'died', '1989', '38', 'years', 'old', 'heart', 'failure', 'caused', 'drugs', 'possibly', 'pneumonia', 'Tooz', 'lived', 'hard', 'partied', 'hard', ""'ll"", 'live', 'movie', 'scary', 'looking', 'loving', 'Sloth', 'friend', 'Chunk', 'rest', 'Goonies']",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS

Since the film's release, it's become a cult classic of sorts, as well as being a favorite film for nostalgic teens and adults.The story follows a group of outcast kids growing up in Oregon, who call themselves the Goonies, as they spend their last weekend together before their parents are forced to sell their homes to make way for a golf course. Mikey, the youngest and most precocious of the Goonies, finds a pirate's treasure map in his attic and realizes that if the Goonies can find the treasure then their parents won't have to sell their homes. Mikey and his good friends, Chunk, Mouth, and Data begin following the clues that will lead to the treasure and they're eventually joined by Mikey's older brother, Brand and two high school girls, Andy and Stef. But things become complicated when a family of second-rate criminals, the Fratellis, catch Chunk and find out about the treasure. Jake and Francis Fratelli lock Chunk up in a room with their deformed brother, Sloth. Sloth may be fearsome in appearance but his grotesque exterior hides a heart of gold, and he and Chunk become fast friends. Meanwhile the other Goonies make their way through a series of underground tunnels, all the way avoiding booby traps and following the clues. Little do they know that the Fratellis, lead by Mama Fratelli, are in hot pursuit. But can the Goonies find the pirates' treasure and save their homes, and can they outsmart the Fratellis?Like many of Spielberg's own films, The Goonies follows a specific formula. The kids, like those in E.T., swear frequently and use vulgar language, so parents be warned. There's also some risqu&eacute; humor and comic violence, but most of which is simply too funny to be offensive. When inspected closely, the story unravels due to numerous plot holes, continuity errors, and a general lack of realism. But that's all part of the charm of The Goonies.The ensemble cast is terrific especially Sean Astin as Mikey, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Ke Huy Quan as Data, Josh Brolin as Brand, Martha Plimpton as Stef, Kerri Green as Andy, John Matuszak as Sloth, Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis Fratelli, and Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli.The excellent DVD includes outtakes (features the infamous missing octopus scene), The Making of The Goonies vintage featurette, a ridiculously silly 12-minute Cyndi Lauper music video, theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary (with video commentary by Richard Donner, Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Ke Huy Quan, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green). This audio/video commentary is perhaps the most entertaining feature I've ever seen on a DVD and alone makes this a worthy purchase.Also recommended:GremlinsBack to the Future - The Complete TrilogyExplorersFlight of the NavigatorThe Monster SquadHome AloneThe Sandlot",4,"""Goonies Never Say Die!""",1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,3044,"['1985', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'filmsandE.T', 'served', 'executive', 'producer', 'Goonies', 'adventure', 'film', 'based', 'story', 'Spielberg', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Superman', 'film', 'release', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'sorts', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'favorite', 'film', 'nostalgic', 'teens', 'adults.The', 'story', 'group', 'outcast', 'kids', 'growing', 'up', 'Oregon', 'who', 'call', 'Goonies', 'spend', 'last', 'weekend', 'together', 'parents', 'are', 'forced', 'sell', 'homes', 'make', 'way', 'golf', 'course', 'Mikey', 'youngest', 'most', 'precocious', 'Goonies', 'pirate', 'treasure', 'map', 'attic', 'Goonies', 'can', 'find', 'treasure', 'then', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'sell', 'homes', 'Mikey', 'good', 'friends', 'Chunk', 'Mouth', 'Data', 'begin', 'following', 'clues', 'will', 'lead', 'treasure', ""'re"", 'eventually', 'joined', 'Mikey', 'older', 'brother', 'Brand', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'Andy', 'Stef', 'things', 'become', 'complicated', 'when', 'family', 'second-rate', 'criminals', 'Fratellis', 'catch', 'Chunk', 'find', 'out', 'treasure', 'Jake', 'Francis', 'Fratelli', 'lock', 'Chunk', 'up', 'room', 'deformed', 'brother', 'Sloth', 'Sloth', 'may', 'be', 'fearsome', 'appearance', 'grotesque', 'exterior', 'heart', 'gold', 'Chunk', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'Goonies', 'make', 'way', 'series', 'underground', 'tunnels', 'way', 'avoiding', 'booby', 'traps', 'following', 'clues', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'Fratellis', 'lead', 'Mama', 'Fratelli', 'are', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'can', 'Goonies', 'find', 'pirates', 'treasure', 'save', 'homes', 'can', 'outsmart', 'Fratellis', 'many', 'Spielberg', 'own', 'films', 'Goonies', 'specific', 'formula', 'kids', 'E.T.', 'swear', 'frequently', 'use', 'vulgar', 'language', 'parents', 'be', 'warned', 'also', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'humor', 'comic', 'violence', 'most', 'simply', 'too', 'funny', 'be', 'offensive', 'When', 'inspected', 'closely', 'story', 'unravels', 'due', 'numerous', 'plot', 'holes', 'continuity', 'errors', 'general', 'lack', 'realism', 'part', 'charm', 'Goonies.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'terrific', 'especially', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Mikey', 'Jeff', 'Cohen', 'Chunk', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Mouth', 'Ke', 'Huy', 'Quan', 'Data', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Brand', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'Stef', 'Kerri', 'Green', 'Andy', 'John', 'Matuszak', 'Sloth', 'Robert', 'Davi', 'Jake', 'Fratelli', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Francis', 'Fratelli', 'Anne', 'Ramsey', 'Mama', 'Fratelli.The', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'outtakes', 'infamous', 'missing', 'octopus', 'scene', 'Making', 'Goonies', 'vintage', 'featurette', 'ridiculously', 'silly', '12-minute', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'music', 'video', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'audio', 'commentary', 'video', 'commentary', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Jeff', 'Cohen', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Ke', 'Huy', 'Quan', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'Kerri', 'Green', 'audio/video', 'commentary', 'perhaps', 'most', 'entertaining', 'feature', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'alone', 'worthy', 'purchase.Also', 'recommended', 'GremlinsBack', 'Future', 'Complete', 'TrilogyExplorersFlight', 'NavigatorThe', 'Monster', 'SquadHome', 'AloneThe', 'Sandlot']",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS

363865,ADVX0P3EIKWBK,6303212379,Darth Wader,"[3, 4]","Goonies, the greatest 80's movie of all times, is one of those movies that doesn't ever get old to me.  I remember loving this movie as a kid, and as an adult, well, some things never change!  I can still quote most lines from this movie, and although that annoys some people, other people love to quote it right back at me.  The Goonies is an adventure from the get-go and it keeps you rooting for the Goonies the entire time while hating the Fratelli's.  Donner and Spielberg have created a timeless movie with all of the pure 80's goodness.  Let's face it: the hair, the outfits, the music, the sayings.  It's all outdated.  But the story and characters are timeless, and the movie is bursting with energy.  Sean Astin is gold in this movie, and I was glad to see him get his career back on track after The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.  And can I say that I had the biggest crush on Kerri Green?!  Wow!  She was great in ""Lucas"" as well.  Corey Feldman, is well, he's Corey Feldman, and he's extremely annoying in the DVD commentary (so much so that his constant interrupting sends Sean Astin to leave and not come back!).  Chunk does a great Truffle Shuffle and other characters round out this wildly entertaining adventure.  And there are funny little mistakes in the movie (like Sean Astin calling Josh Brolin ""Josh"" instead of by his character's name ""Brand"" when they are in the basement), but the deleted scenes help answer some of those mistakes (like the octopus being scary).  Watching the deleted scenes makes you feel like it was the right decision that they were deleted because most of them DID NOT look good!  I am actually pretty happy that there never was a sequel as I think it probably wouldn't have been that good and that our expectations would be too high, and ultimately, all of us who loved the original would have been disappointed.  And I do agree that this movie is actually more like a PG-13 movie.  Too much unnecessary language that shouldn't have been there in the first place.",5,"Down here, it's our time.

Litton,"[5, 6]","Part preteen mystery novel, part shiver-me-timbers adventure trek, &quot;The Goonies&quot; is a classic example of crowd-pleasing entertainment that needs no logic in order to tell its story. Director Richard Donner seems to have gathered this seek-and-find journey from the childhood fantasies of every child in the world a dozen times over, and the result is pure, unrelenting fun from beginning to end!The plot is the simplest one imaginable: Mikey, Mouth, Data, and Chunk, a group of friends who call themselves The Goonies, stumble across a centuries-old map of the upper West Coast, near their homes, where there is a treasure believed to be buried somewhere along the shoreline. Despite the disagreement of Mikey's older brother, Brandon, they leave in search of the treasure, in hopes that their newfound riches will save their homes from a greedy developer.Their hopes are somewhat thwarted when the path to the treasure lands them face-to-face with the Fratellis, a mother-son crime team who begin tracking the kids once they realize that there is money at stake. As they all make their way deeper and deeper into the caverns leading to the pirate ship, they encounter dangers that will keep kids on the edge of their seats.This is all done with a high level of laughter, lightheartedness, and surprising enjoyment. Each character is given a certain demeanor, different from others. Mikey is crippled by a speech impediment, while Chunk, like his name, is husky and clumsy; Data has a pseudo-James Bond fascination about him, and Mouth is outspoken and crude. All of their personalities combine with hilarious results, a special part of the film's magical charm.The cast also seems to be having a tremendous amount of fun with the movie. To scrutinize their performances is completely cynical, for their is little that can be criticized. The dialogue is corny from the start, but everyone takes it all in stride, and together, they polish off each moment with comedic joy and humor.As a child, I enjoyed this movie immensely, and as I look back on it, the adventure was quite suspenseful, due to my age and experience with movies. The journey through the underground caverns, the booby traps, the children at the hands of the not-so-cunning crooks... all of this is pure magic for a kid, without being overly frightening. Now, as an adult, the movie has a much different effect on me, allowing me to recall my childhood fantasies, and the vast enjoyment I had for this film.&quot;The Goonies&quot; is a classic adventure that appeals to many, kids and adults alike. It's got a charm and sense of humor that grow on you, and its indulgence in its own corniness is, in its own way, appealing. For those who experienced it as a child, to watch it now is to recapture a pleasurable memory from childhood; for those new to the experience, it recalls your own fantasies and beliefs as a kid, and leaves you smiling with satisfaction.",5,A child fantasy masterpiece!,1002067200,"10 3, 2001",2001,2937,"['Part', 'preteen', 'mystery', 'novel', 'part', 'shiver-me-timbers', 'adventure', 'trek', 'quot', 'Goonies', 'quot', 'classic', 'example', 'crowd-pleasing', 'entertainment', 'logic', 'order', 'tell', 'story', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'have', 'gathered', 'seek-and-find', 'journey', 'childhood', 'fantasies', 'child', 'world', 'dozen', 'times', 'result', 'pure', 'unrelenting', 'fun', 'beginning', 'end', 'plot', 'simplest', 'one', 'imaginable', 'Mikey', 'Mouth', 'Data', 'Chunk', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'call', 'Goonies', 'stumble', 'centuries-old', 'map', 'upper', 'West', 'Coast', 'homes', 'where', 'treasure', 'believed', 'be', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'shoreline', 'disagreement', 'Mikey', 'older', 'brother', 'Brandon', 'leave', 'search', 'treasure', 'hopes', 'newfound', 'riches', 'will', 'save', 'homes', 'greedy', 'developer.Their', 'hopes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'thwarted', 'when', 'path', 'treasure', 'face-to-face', 'Fratellis', 'mother-son', 'crime', 'team', 'who', 'begin', 'tracking', 'kids', 'realize', 'money', 'stake', 'make', 'way', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'caverns', 'leading', 'pirate', 'ship', 'encounter', 'dangers', 'will', 'keep', 'kids', 'edge', 'seats.This', 'done', 'high', 'level', 'laughter', 'lightheartedness', 'surprising', 'enjoyment', 'character', 'given', 'certain', 'demeanor', 'different', 'others', 'Mikey', 'crippled', 'speech', 'impediment', 'Chunk', 'name', 'husky', 'clumsy', 'Data', 'pseudo-James', 'Bond', 'fascination', 'Mouth', 'outspoken', 'crude', 'personalities', 'combine', 'hilarious', 'results', 'special', 'part', 'film', 'magical', 'charm.The', 'cast', 'also', 'be', 'having', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'fun', 'movie', 'scrutinize', 'performances', 'completely', 'cynical', 'little', 'can', 'be', 'criticized', 'dialogue', 'corny', 'start', 'everyone', 'stride', 'together', 'polish', 'moment', 'comedic', 'joy', 'humor.As', 'child', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'immensely', 'look', 'back', 'adventure', 'was', 'quite', 'suspenseful', 'due', 'age', 'experience', 'movies', 'journey', 'underground', 'caverns', 'booby', 'traps', 'children', 'hands', 'not-so-cunning', 'crooks', 'pure', 'magic', 'kid', 'being', 'overly', 'frightening', 'Now', 'adult', 'movie', 'much', 'different', 'effect', 'allowing', 'recall', 'childhood', 'fantasies', 'vast', 'enjoyment', 'had', 'film.', 'quot', 'Goonies', 'quot', 'classic', 'adventure', 'appeals', 'many', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'got', 'charm', 'sense', 'humor', 'grow', 'indulgence', 'own', 'corniness', 'own', 'way', 'appealing', 'who', 'experienced', 'child', 'watch', 'now', 'recapture', 'pleasurable', 'memory', 'childhood', 'new', 'experience', 'own', 'fantasies', 'beliefs', 'kid', 'smiling', 'satisfaction']",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS

363894,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6303212379,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[51, 62]","The first thing I was thinking when ""Goonies"" really kicked into gear was: This is the daydream of an adventure-loving preadolescent boy, full of pirates, bloodthirsty villains, and exotic twists and turns in an underground maze full of booby traps. It's sort of ""Indiana Jones"" for the kids as well as the adults.The Goonies (a band of young boys) are spending their last weekend hanging around their hometown, before it's razed for yuppie developers. Then Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin) uncovers a treasure map hidden in an old painting, and becomes obsessed with finding the lost treasure of the pirate One-Eyed Willie. With that treasure, they could save their town.But the hunt for treasure sends the Goonies, Mikey's long-suffering teenage brother (Josh Brolin), and a pair of teenage girls (Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton) into dangerous proximity to the murderous fugitives, the Fratellis. With the Fratellis on their tail, the Goonies are determinedly navigating the underground, booby-trap-infested tunnels that lead to the treasure -- or to a very nasty demise.The stolidly mature among you may scoff at the improbability of the story, but who cares? This is obviously a fantasy story, harkening back to pirate treasure and childhood adventures, thwarting the evil guys. The classic formulae are what makes it so fun. ""Goonies"" is like ""Indiana Jones"" in the sense that it's action-filled, with nasty villains, elaborate booby-traps, and a plotline that is wonderfully improbable. This is just fun. The sets are amazingly complex, full of stone tunnels and enormous waterfalls full of money, thin little bridges and a bone piano that causes the floor to collapse.Sean Astin (yes, this is THAT Sean Astin, the guy currently starring as Samwise Gamgee in ""Lord of the Rings"") is endearing and very convincing as Mikey, the gutsy boy that could.

It captures all of the childhood joy and want of adventure and excitement that a normal day just doesn't bring. This movie, while it is clearly an ""80's"" flick, does not appear dated in any way. It still has that spark that gave it life nearly 20 years ago.That said, here's what you get with this DVD and here's why you should buy it today:The movie itself is enough however...The deleted scenes are a lot of fun. We finally get to see the ever-fabled ""Octopus"" scene. For years, I would scratch my head when Data said ""The Octopus was really scary!"" Huh? What Octopus? Well, he's in this DVD. You also realize why the scene was cut out. Let's just say the animatronics weren't all that great.Those old music videos starring Cyndi Lauper and various classic WWF wrestlers are here too. Remember Rock ""n"" Wrestling? I found myself saying ""oh yeah....I remember that!"" Watch for a cameo of Susanna Hoffs from the Bangles in the video!The DVD commentary is a lot of fun! While almost every new DVD has a commentary in place, it almost always bores one to tears with the director or a star just kind of droning their way through the movie. Often, the major stars don't even do the commentary (great example is Rocky - where the commentary features everyone but Stallone himself!) This commentary has all of the original Goonie stars plus Richard Donner. There's a lot of joking around and the stories they tell are funny and don't go off the subject.

363909,A1PEKEZTSDJAVH,6303212379,Eric San Juan,"[2, 2]","One of the 1980s' most enjoyable romps, this fun adventure throws together a group of kids spending their last days with one another into a quest for hidden treasure, all with escaped criminals on their tail. What follows is a movie filled with spills, chills, chases, action, awesome set pieces and obstacles, and plenty of humor. All very predictable, and all very fun. Think The Little Rascals in the world of Indiana Jones and you have the right idea.Take note before buying this for kids: Some of the humor from the 80s is probably more risqu&eacute; than would be expected. This would probably get a PG-13 were it released today. The kids joke about sexuality and drugs in a way that many might be surprised about. Parents with small children, proceed with caution. That said, the movie remains kid friendly enough that it should be fine for most kids over 10.This DVD looks very good; while not state-of-the-art, it is an improvement over the VHS versions that have kicked around for years. Great sound, good picture. All very nice.The extras really stand out here. We have a Making Of documentary that covers all the bases, with plenty of on set footage and interviews. Informative and well done. An array of deleted scenes was surprisingly good - some of this footage is excellent - though not complete. Finally, the DVD commentary brings the cast back together for a very funny gathering as they swap stories from way back when. Good viewing for longtime fans.The only downer on this DVD is that it comes in one of those awful Warner's snapcases. This reviewer hates those cases; if you have no such hatred, then there is nothing to worry about.

I wish more movies got this kind of treatment for their Blu-Ray release, Ghostbusters, Big Trouble In Little China and Die Hard really should have gotten this kind of treatment. The box for the 25th anniversary of The Goonies is great, the inside cover has the map to the treasure of One Eyed Willie, there is a board game it comes with, a press release kit recreation that was shrunk down and some other goodies. The overall presentation of this is stellar. They really couldn't have done a better job. I have heard some complaints about the transfer but I think it looks borderline immaculate. There is no DNR, not too many soft edges, no muddy images, it looks sharp and crisp and retains a lot of the original film grain. There's a decent amount of special features and I am really glad I got this, it's well worth the price. If you grew up with this movie and are a fan, you need this. Thankfully they still haven't made a sequel to this like they have talked about. Sequels suck folks, If you don't believe me, look at what those Hollywood Dougs did with Ghostbusters, because Ghostbusters 2 is one of the worst sequels ever. It completely undermines the first film (which is a modern masterpiece of cinema) and isn't a good movie in any way, shape or form. I just hope they don't try and squeeze more money out of the Goonies by making some crappy, forced sequel.

(&#34;Gremlins&#34;, maybe?).  I'd think of it from time to time, and thus it stayed fresh in my mind; so imagine my &#34;shock&#34; to realize how old it was.  I mean, Dated.  Like a Shirley Temple film.  &#34;You Are Here&#34; says the galaxy map of time and space, and it's 1985.  That isn't necessarily a good thing, unless you like the 'eighties, and a lot of people do---as States Evidence I point to the fact that this film has its own website fan group.For the Record, this Astoria, in Oregon, is on the West Coast.  The movie starts off rather shakily with manic over-acting on the part of the kids, with half of them playing adult, Jersey Shore roles.  The girls in particular, when they show up, are right out of Big Hair East Coast 'Eighties (watch &#34;Moonstruck&#34;) something I never saw when I was passing through this area, regularly, in the day.  But Hollywood has deep Astoria, NY connections so I understand.In any case, within 30 minutes or so, the cast settles down and the story takes off.  From this point on, it's a pretty entertaining film.  Of course, times have changed and today the film seems like the basis for a Disneyland theme ride that never was, probably thanks to the &#34;Raiders...&#34; movies that produced one that is.  But the sets, especially inside the cliff, are quite imaginative and visually appealing.  The bad guys are bad enough, but still funny.  I don't think it's a spoiler to say it has a happy ending----only a clod couldn't figure that out.  But it was the very-very ending that I didn't like when I saw it, and saying what that was would be a spoiler, and probably why I never saw it again---the very last part could have been done better.Given that this is a Family Film, we have to note the abundant foul language.  By this point, Spielberg had come to be seen as the Modern Disney, producing saccharine sweet stories heavily tinted with nostalgia, and to protect himself from associations with the post-Walt, Disney crap that Eisner was just beginning to wrench that studio out of, Spielberg decided to use foul language and sexual references by kids to give a realistic edge.  A stupid and utterly unnecessary decision, especially given the lens of time.What's amusing is the Product Placement, which was just taking off---along with Corporate Naming, having been ushered in by the 1984 Olympics, Los Angeles--which made them profitable for the first time in decades, but left us with a legacy of baseball parks and theaters named for Corporations.  Here it's fairly tame, a couple of Pepsi cans and a Pizza Hut box too obviously &#34;placed&#34; in the frame.Some folks can't leave their youth behind---you see them at state fairs dancing to 1970s Disco hits with their kids, mindless of the often blatant sexual references;  those folks book DIsney cruises to Disney Parks and Disney Islands, and join &#34;The Goonies&#34; and &#34;The Christmas Story&#34; fan clubs.  Good for them.  It is not a disease, it certainly isn't contageous.  You can watch this film without catching it.  And, if the kids you know keep insisting you watch one of their miserable cartoons or films that you've seen over and over again, this might be old enough that they aren't aware of it, which would allow you to watch something with them that they will probably enjoy, without having to fear cramps and muscle aches from ninety minutes in permanent cringe mode.Go for it!",3,"Sweet, Vintage 'Eighties Spielberg-Produced Film.

Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys.""Shut up!I honestly cannot fathom the universal adoration that the masses have for The Goonies. It's one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen in my life. Only the Von Trap children and the brats Spielberg cast as the Lost Boys in Hook have irritated me more than The Goonies (with the exception of Chunk). Before I get into the movie I'll give you a run down of the cast.Sean Astin as Mikey: seems as if he is phonetically reading off cue cards (a-la Peanuts) rather than fully understanding what he is saying.Josh Brolin as Brand: a constant damper on the adventure as he does nothing but attempt to diffuse the fun with his constant 'grown-up' perspective.Short Round as Data: so lovable in Temple of Doom, in the space of one year he managed to become the most annoying characters in movie history. Very little he says can be understood. His inventions are cartoonish, out of place, contribute nothing, and spoil many scenes. Whenever he opens his mouth I just want to grit my teeth down to the gums.Corey Feldman as Mouth: would be tolerable if he stopped screaming so much. This applies to the whole cast, but especially Mouth. Is better when he's serious instead of sarcastic, which isn't often unfortunately.Kerri Green as Andy: again, she would be bearable is she just shut up. Her random petrified rant about looking after her body is completely un-called-for and spoils the scene.Martha Plimpton as Stef: likable, but doesn't have much to do or serve any purpose.Jeff Cohen as Chunk: adorable, and the best (and youngest) actor of the bunch by far. Cohen's talent is infectious and it's a shame that the rest of the child cast undo his effort. In the scene where he confesses his previous misbehavior you can see that Robert Davi is loving it and cannot hold in his laughter.John Matuszak as Sloth: also adorable, but his ""Hey, you guys"" moment spoils everything.The Goonies was the second of three films in a row that Chris Columbus wrote for Amblin. If it had the shades of darkness and horror of Gremlins before it, or Young Sherlock Holmes after it, then it may well have been a true classic. Richard Donner (a loud, monstrous director who I really like) even used darkness to great effect in Scrooged a few years later, but here he seems to be really distracted by the fact that he's laughing at the antics off-camera and unable to see that, as a finished film, it's not as funny as he thinks it is. I mean what teenage kid, in the 80s, played with marbles or pretended to be James Bond? He directs these kids as if they were 7 or 8 instead of 13-ish. A film depicting more realistic teenagers would have won me over right away.The titular gang themselves live in Astoria, Oregon and are failing to enjoy their last weekend together before the rich folks tear down their houses to build a golf course. That is until Mikey suddenly remembers the treasure map up in the loft. So off they go to find the treasure of pirate captain One-Eyed Willie against the wishes of downer big brother Brand. They soon discover that the entrance to the subterranean world where Willie lies waiting begins underneath an abandoned restaurant used as a hideout by the Fratelli crime family. They only just barely manage to sneak into tunnels without being noticed, leaving Chunk behind to have his own sideshow adventure. Once inside the tunnels they encounter a gauntlet of traps set by Willie to prevent anyone getting his loot.Sound good right? And it would be if handled by a different director, or was scored by someone other than Dave Gruisin, who turns in a fully generic effort with no standout themes or melodies. Silvestri and Goldsmith were very busy in 1985, but nobody Gruisin, who I have never heard of before or since, was the wrong choice. I fully believe that Columbus' script was worthy, as I have read the novelization and it's far superior to the film, but for above listed reasons it doesn't work for me as a film.A lot of The Goonies has been rudely forced into pop-culture too. How exactly is 'The Truffle Shuffle' funny? Why do people fondly remember this? It's...nothing. Why do people always quote Sloth's ""Hey, you guys!"" as if it's hilarious. It isn't. It is absolutely not funny at all. By the end Donner allows the action to become campy and farcical, disrespecting the story and pathos. There are moments towards the climax where I honestly feel like switching the movie off.Stick with the novelization, and be thankful a sequel was never made.The Blu Ray features an above-average 2.40:1 1080p picture with Dolby TrueHD sound.

Best I've seen and he shows it with this which is one of his best along with Jaws, ET, Shindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Indian Jones, Jurassic Park, and much much more of his best. I don't know. His movies of today are kind of becoming a little bit of a blunder, like War of the Worlds, and The Terminal. But they were great at some scenes, but still they're not his best. Steven might be going a little downhill with his movies, because probably he's running low on ideas and most of them have already been done. But, PLEASE!!! Everyone Do not attempt to remake any of his classics. They are meant to be done once and be the best forever. Like if Jaws is done again it will be a load of garbage.

I ran around my house as a young one, trying to act like Mouth, or doing the Truffle Shuffle to entertain friends (I lacked on the truffle, but I could do the shuffle).The Goonies holds something that every kid should find magical, even though the only magic in the movie is the magic of friendship. Steven Spielberg wrote the story about a group of friends who are about to lose their houses so a country club can be built where they leave. They come upon a treasure map that supposedly has a legend behind it, and leads to a great treasure. Mikey and his colorful bunch of friends set up to go in search of the treasure not knowing the villianist trio, the Fratellis, are also out for the treasure. Along the way, chaos ensues, friendships go stronger, and they meet a creature who has nothing but love to share and Baby Ruths to eat.The characters are all likable . . . are all lovable, and the actors who portray them made them all that they were. The Fratellis are even, in some ways, likable throughout the movie, but in the end, they get what they were asking for. The directing, of course, is awesome. None like it actually. And the sets are amazing. Especially the pirate ship set.

364008,AWAXS66YMHMNW,6303212379,"J. Thomason ""Movie Family""","[1, 1]","The Goonies Bowling for Movies Score: 300 of 300!!  Wahoo - a perfect score :]  Good stuff for sure - at the time of this review only a small handful of movies can boast they got a perfect Bowling for Movies Score - The Big Lebowski, Popeye, and A Clockwork Orange.  A prestigious honor (if I do say so myself) and an incredibly small list considering the hundreds of movies I've seen.But wait - what is this whole Bowling For Movies score anyway (you may very well be asking yourself)?  Well, let me tell you ladies and jellyspoons, I watch movies - LOTS and LOTS of movies.  In a typical week I can watch a dozen or more movies.  I own hundreds of movies - some are 3D, some Blu Rays, many DVDs, heck - I even own a few streaming on Amazon.  It occurred to me that my great love of movies (and collecting) has resulted in a unique problem - I had no way of knowing which were my favorites and then a brain-flower was born which blossomed into Bowling for Movies - just an average dude's way of ranking movies using a scoring system which literally has NOTHING to do with bowling!  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea.  I know what you're likely thinking - what a great use of quasi/pseudo-science!  And I'd agree :]Ok, Movie Dude - if its so great what's it about??Set in and about the Oregonian coastal town of Astoria, a group of pre-teen rejects (The Goonies) set out on the adventure of a lifetime to find the fabled treasure of the dread pirate One-Eyed Willie in order to save their homes which are slated for repossession and destruction to make way for a golf course.  Lead by the iron-willed asthmatic Mickey Walsh (a young Sean Astin) and armed with a treasure map the band of misfit friends brave subterranean labyrinths, dangerous booby traps, and hardcore, despicable criminals in their bid for all that shiny swag.Wonderfully shot, creatively crafted - The Goonies is a true gem of an 80's movie.  To top the entire movie experience off the flick features a top notch soundtrack with some of the decade's most memorable artists such as Cyndi Lauper, REO Speedwagon,  and The Bangles.  This movie was more than Goon-enough for me when I was 14 and now that I'm 42 it's even better as I share the Goonies experience with my little Goonies (Little Miss Movie Dude).What went right:&lt; > Um, like everything - great story, great cinematography, great jokes, great adventure... what can I tell you - it's just a wonderful time.What went wrong:&lt; > Um, like nothing - great movie for kids, teens, or simply the young at heart.Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",5,The Goonies Bowling for Movies Score!,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,3266,"['Goonies', 'Bowling', 'Movies', 'Score', '300', '300', 'Wahoo', 'perfect', 'score', ']', 'Good', 'stuff', 'sure', 'time', 'review', 'only', 'small', 'handful', 'movies', 'can', 'boast', 'got', 'perfect', 'Bowling', 'Movies', 'Score', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'Popeye', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'A', 'prestigious', 'honor', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'incredibly', 'small', 'list', 'considering', 'hundreds', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen.But', 'wait', 'what', 'whole', 'Bowling', 'Movies', 'score', 'anyway', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'asking', 'Well', 'let', 'tell', 'ladies', 'jellyspoons', 'watch', 'movies', 'LOTS', 'LOTS', 'movies', 'typical', 'week', 'can', 'watch', 'dozen', 'more', 'movies', 'own', 'hundreds', 'movies', 'are', '3D', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'many', 'DVDs', 'heck', 'even', 'own', 'few', 'streaming', 'Amazon', 'occurred', 'great', 'love', 'movies', 'collecting', 'resulted', 'unique', 'problem', 'had', 'way', 'knowing', 'were', 'favorites', 'then', 'brain-flower', 'was', 'born', 'blossomed', 'Bowling', 'Movies', 'just', 'average', 'dude', 'way', 'ranking', 'movies', 'using', 'scoring', 'system', 'literally', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'bowling', 'score', '108', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'ok', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', '/', 'bad', 'movie', 'where', 'score', '192', 'would', 'tell', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Now', 'break', '200', ""'ve"", 'got', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'Throw', 'too', 'many', 'gutterballs', 'will', 'land', '100', 'well', 'get', 'idea', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'likely', 'thinking', 'what', 'great', 'use', 'quasi/pseudo-science', ""'d"", 'agree', ']', 'Ok', 'Movie', 'Dude', 'so', 'great', 'what', 'Set', 'Oregonian', 'coastal', 'town', 'Astoria', 'group', 'pre-teen', 'rejects', 'Goonies', 'set', 'out', 'adventure', 'lifetime', 'find', 'fabled', 'treasure', 'dread', 'pirate', 'One-Eyed', 'Willie', 'order', 'save', 'homes', 'are', 'slated', 'repossession', 'destruction', 'make', 'way', 'golf', 'course', 'Lead', 'iron-willed', 'asthmatic', 'Mickey', 'Walsh', 'young', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'armed', 'treasure', 'band', 'misfit', 'friends', 'brave', 'subterranean', 'labyrinths', 'dangerous', 'booby', 'traps', 'hardcore', 'despicable', 'criminals', 'bid', 'shiny', 'swag.Wonderfully', 'shot', 'creatively', 'crafted', 'Goonies', 'true', 'gem', '80', 'movie', 'top', 'entire', 'movie', 'experience', 'flick', 'top', 'notch', 'soundtrack', 'decade', 'most', 'memorable', 'artists', 'such', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'REO', 'Speedwagon', 'Bangles', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'Goon-enough', 'when', 'was', '14', 'now', ""'m"", '42', 'even', 'better', 'share', 'Goonies', 'experience', 'little', 'Goonies', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Movie', 'Dude', 'went', 'right', 'lt', 'Um', 'everything', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'cinematography', 'great', 'jokes', 'great', 'adventure', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'just', 'wonderful', 'went', 'wrong', 'lt', 'Um', 'nothing', 'great', 'movie', 'kids', 'teens', 'simply', 'young', 'heart.Hey', 'have', 'question', 'review', 'feel', 'free', 'leave', 'comment', 'will', 'try', 'answer', 'promptly', 'will', 'be', 'leaving', 'more', 'movie', 'reviews', 'bowling', 'scores', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'reviews', 'Bowling', 'Movies', 'way', 'affiliated', 'Amazon', 'do', 'have', 'website', 'other', 'business', 'interest', ""'m"", 'just', 'dude', 'who', 'movies', 'quasi/pseudo-science', ']', 'Want', 'review', 'movie', 'score', 'Amazon', 'review', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'have', ""'ll"", 'get']",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS

Now that over 20 years have gone by and my boys are grown, I occasionally watch it on DVD and in retrospect, I am a little surprised at some of the lines. I know this film is a cult movie and it probably deserves it, but really didn't see the need for some of the language, like ""Oh Sh-t"" from Chunk, and so on.My kids really enjoyed this film and wound up being ""influenced"" by the flick in a few ways.  My wife and I bought a pirates map on fake parchment for them which we had framed and placed in their room which we called a Goonies Map.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 3]","Combining swashbuckling, mystery, murder, pre-teen wonder and teen angst, ""The Goonies,"" is a wonderful film about two brothers and their friends who are about to lose their homes but wind up on an amazing journey that just might save them all.  When the Walsh brothers and their friends find a map in the family attic, the ""Goonies"" set out on one last adventure before having to say goodbye to each other.What they find is a trail leading to the treasure of the infamous One-Eyed Willie, a pirate who literally protected his gold to his death.  The gang has to get past a number of booby traps, including a piano of death, in order to get Willie's treasure.  They also have to deal with a rich high school bully and the murderous Fratelli family.This film is fun from the beginning.  Steven Spielberg story and Chris Columbus' screenplay fit well on the screen.  Director Richard Donner blends humor, adventure, and a touch of romance into the tale that prevents the story from ever getting boring.  Cyndi Lauper's ""The Goonies R' Good Enough"" sets the musical tone for the film.The cast features a number of (at the time) up-and-coming actors.  Sean Astin plays the younger Walsh son, Mikey.  Josh Brolin plays Brandon Walsh.  Indie princess Martha Plimpton plays Stef Steinbrenner.  Future fight choreographer (and also ""Short Round"" in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") Ke Huy Quan plays Data.  Jeff Cohen portrays Chunk.  Kerri Green plays Andy Carmichael and future ""Two Coreys"" star Corey Feldman rounds out the Goonies as Mouth.The Fratelli clan is filled with the wonderful Anne Ramsey as Ma Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis, Robert Davi as Jake and John Matuszak as the legendary Sloth.Be warned that their is quite a bit of strong language in this film.  It pre-dates the PG-13 era, and probably would have received that rating if it had been around.  The rest of the tale is family friendly, with only mild peril and one murder.For a solid afternoon or evening of family fun, I highly recommend ""The Goonies.""

It had everything - adventure, danger, treasure, cool gizmos, and bumbling bad guys. This, in my books, is the best kids adventure movie ever made. What's more, it is still great to watch as an adult - there are numerous gags that would just go straight over the heads of kids that now make so much more sense.The Goondocks, in Astoria, are being demolished to make way for a golf course and resort. A local bunch of kids, who have affectionately named themselves The Goonies, are not taking the news too kindly as this is their favourite place in the whole wide world. On a rainy day before the Goondocks were due to be demolished Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin), Brandon Walsh (Josh Brolin), Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Johnathon Ke Quan) are bumming around the Walsh house feeling very depressed. On a whim they decide to go rummaging through the attic, out-of-bounds to all mind you, and 'stumble' across an ancient treasure map and doubloon depicting the whereabouts of One-Eyed Willie and his treasure.Needless to say The Goonies see this as a great adventure, not to mention a chance to pay off foreclosing banks! Along the way they get mixed up with the Fratellis, some of the most bumbling 'evil' criminals ever to grace the silver screen. Ma Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) is the matriach with a firm controlling hand on Jake (Robert Davi), and Francis (Joe Pantoliano). Boy, is Ma one scary lady! The Goonies also come across Andy (Kerri Green) and Stef (Martha Plimpton). These two join the swelling ranks of The Goonies and help wend their way through the caves and booby traps laid by One-Eyed Willie centuries ago.Throw into this movie mix the enigmatic, and gigantically huge, Sloth (John Matuszak), booby traps, high adventure, a blender, a few bats, an octopus (almost!), incredible treasure, a one-eyed pirate, falling boulders, the most amazing waterslide, a few skeletons, and a buccaneer fight aboard an ancient pirate sloop - what more do you want?

It's filled with memorable lines and wacky humour that appealed to kids back then. But is it actually that good? Well, some of it is a bit grinding sometimes, where the film starts to verge on ""screaming"" humour, which we all know, ain't funny at all. But the bunch of weirdos who go off in search of 'One-eyed Willie's treasure proves for some good-natured fun and innocent adventure.The standout performance in the film is Jonathan Ke Quan (INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), where we find out, that HEY, Some kids CAN act! It's fun to spot all the young kiddies who went on to bigger things like Josh Brolin and Sean Astin. And of course, Jeff Cohen as the wimpy 'Chunk' who keeps coming across corpses, providing some halarious moments. The fact that Donner helmed this small-scale adventure seems strange, given that he went on to do things like THE OMEN and the LETHAL WEAPON films, but it's handled well, and dosn't get TOO far-fetched. You have to have bad guys of course, and this one has Robert Davi (From A VIEW TO A KILL) and THE MATRIX's Joe Pantoliano as the bumbling Fratelli brothers chasing after the ""Goonies"".

Coming along to spoil the show, we have a wealthy land developer with his brat of a son as a sidekick who want to raze the town and turn it into a golf resort.Not willing to be uprooted from their beloved town, the industrious kids (with the help of a found treasure map and a local pirate legend) stumble upon a passage that could possibly lead them to treasure.Getting to this point was only half the fun.  Now we're really in for a good time!  Enter the danger, adventure and all out pursuit of treasure.  We follow the 7 youngsters through booby traps, dark caverns, perilous near misses, and exciting exploits that is sure to grab the imagination of adults and children alike.  And all this while being chased by 3 bumbling but quite funny counterfeiters who add a great touch to the plot.Moving right along, while avoiding all the pitfalls that might trip up most people (but not these young Indian Jones proteges), they discover the ultimate prize in the form of a long hidden Pirate ship located in a lagoon enclosed by a mammoth cave.Upon searching the ship (and dodging more inventive booby traps to boot), the pirates treasure is found which is a means to an end to pay off the land developer to save the town.Not so fast!  No easy getaway for these bunch of resourceful and rambunctious little ones.  Along comes those dastardly counterfeiters destined to spoil the show.  A little walking the plank, some sword fighting, and a whole lot of fun and the baddies are put out of business.  The exit from the cave is no walk in the park either being that the cave itself was booby trapped (yep, another booby trap and a good one).  With the help of a lovable monster and a whole lot of strength, the kids leave the cavern as fast as you please.Believing that upon leaving the cavern that the treasure was lost in the lagoon, alas, we have one of the seven heroes who spirited away several gemstones from the Pirate ship that will save the day for the future of the town!Now, who do we have to thank for this excellent adventure?  Well, let's first look at one of the executive producers.  Steven Spielberg.  Arguably the best movie director who has ever been associated with the silver screen and motion pictures.  Almost every piece of work that Spielberg has ever done has turned to gold and he is a master of exceptional movie making.Next, we have director Richard Donner who is behind the blockbuster Lethal Weapon movies and many more greats too numerous to list. He has done an excellent job of making a movie that audiences can count on time and again to enthrall them and make them feel great.This is absolutely 5 stars of fun and excitement all the way and is a sure winner anytime, anywhere.

The storyboard cards are interesting to look at and come in a protective envelope. The other two inserts-the magazine replica and the article reprint are kept next to them as well, sandwiched between the game and the movie. The movie is a bit shorter than everything else, so they've put a cardboard insert to keep it from sliding around.The magazine and article are in fairly small typing, but are fun to look through.The game itself is kept in a box, then a plastic case and is all shrink wrapped. The cards, game pieces and board are individually shrink wrapped as well. The board is fairly heavy duty. I'd say it's made just like a normal game board, just a bit smaller. Folds out larger than expected-didn't measure but at least 12x18. It's big enough to easily play and sturdy enough you're not going to need to be super careful with it either.The movie is a BR.

Now as far as the beginning where you see the prison scene, there you will get some detail but here is the big problem....after the prison scene it starts getting dark ""flickering"" effects around the sides of the picture due to ""I guess"" (DVD defect). maybe I got a bad disc but it could possibly be a defect in all but I will return the disc and let you guys know as soon as I get a new one.

Oddly, the bonus content on the disc is less than 30 minutes (which was ported over from the 2001 DVD). It also contains an audio commentary. On the one hand it is loaded with goodies but the lack of video supplements is disappointing. The longest featurette is only 13 minutes and that's a music video. ""The Making of the Goonies"" documentary is only 7 minutes long. Ultimately, this is a set for diehard fans only since Goonies is now available separately on Blu-ray without the board game.

Some of the lines are hilarious and I always hear something new during repeated viewings.The DVD has a great bonus:  The commentary is a screen within the film of the reunited actors.

Martha Plimpton has some particularly enjoyable memories and a ferocious laugh.The cut scenes (including the famous Octopus scene) are disappointing.  The Octopus looks really fake.

I can only imagine how fun this would be watching it for the first time in the theater, must have been incredable for those who got the chance to. The movie is great the film is by the amazing Richard Donner. The story and every thing is done by the amazing Steven Spielberg who has a way with children and looking through the eyes of the adventure. The screen play is written by Chris Columbus! I mean what more can you ask for with those great men in Hollywood? How about an amazing cast just staring out you have the youngsters like Corey Feldmen who plays the loud mouth &quot;Mouth,&quot; Sean Astin as the kid who leads them on the journey to save their home town, Josh Brolin who plays the older brother and helps keep them out of trouble and other noticable faces. Not only was this movie full of comedy but it leads to a spectacular adventure we can only dream about as kids. With spectacular senery, and great special effects.The DVD is amazing buy, the commentary by the entire cast is worth it to buy from but more on that later. The graphic's of the DVD is outstanding. It leads you through a cave like senery like in the movie with voice over's from the cast. The full length Cindy Lauper video that aired on MTV and was a number one hit &quot;The Goonie's Are Good Enough.&quot; Some cut scene's with the octopus scene, and a scene that was cut out where they are in a 7/11 type store and so on. And a short but sweet Making of the Movie with talk from Richard Donner, some of the cast, and a young Steven himself.As for the commentary that alone is worth the buy. Everyone showed up. However, Sean Astin for reason's unknown walked out in the middle of the commentary and Richard Donner can't remember half of what had happened during the commentary of his own movie. However, a lot of it was saved by Corey Feldman and  and Martha P. You'll hear interesting tid bits like maybe the hat from Indiana Jones was taken for the movie from the last Steven picture at the time :), The Jackson's hung out around the set, funny and memerable moments from the rest of the cast. It's truly amazing and I have fun watching it over and over.

Find a treasure map, ride their bicycles to a forbidden place, break in, find the secret tunnel that leads to the pirate cave, discover the hidden treasure, use it to spring dad from foreclosure and save the town -- all while being pursued by an evil, greedy family with a violent past.Brolin can't act now, so why we would expect acting from him then is unlikely; Astin shows glimpses of the reasons we liked him as Rudy and Sam, but that's about it.

Then, as if by divine intervention, Mike(y) Walsh (Sean Astin) finds a treasure map in his parent's attic, and bands together with his friends, his older brother, and two girls, to find the treasure and save the ""Goondocks.""This DVD release was carefully planned and masterminded by someone rather skillfully.  If it hadn't been for those who knew the potential this DVD had for the many loyal fans, we may have been stuck with nothing more than 2 different language subtitles and the theatrical trailer.  This DVD delivers in the realm of several interesting areas:1)Audio/Video commentary by the cast: Probably one of the most innovative ways for comentary, as we see and hear Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jonathan Ke Quan, and even director Richard Donner give their views.  And even with the comentary, Corey Feldman still embodies the spirit of his character ""Mouth"": the fact is that he seems to never shut up throught the entire commentary.  Some interesting articles get covered up in some areas as some people try to say things but give up when someone else intervenes.2)""The Goonies R Good Enough"" music video by Cyndi Lauper.  Yep, Cyndi Lauper in all her colored haired glory, this time acting in quite a nutty take as her Mom and Pop's gas station is going to be overtaken by greedy corporate types, until she uncovers a secret cave, where she meets the Goonies, and a number of crazies (pirates, a green-faced witch, etc) all search for an ancient treasure.  Steven Spielberg even makes a brief cameo.3)Making of the Goonies-a 7 minute segment on the film, shot back in 1985, very brief, but does show interesting scenes, such as filming inside a ""Snack-shop,"" and a police car chase shot that was omitted.4)Outtakes-this title is misleading, as you may think it was the kids flubbing their lines.  Actually, it contains 3 scenes, including the deleted snack-shop sequence, a further dissection of One-Eyed Willy's treasure map, and then the gang's encounter with a giant octopus.5)Page layout: the main screen looks like the caverns, and really captures the movie instead of a static image, any direction you go will cause something on the menu to happen.Even with 5 stars, there will always be things that we, the fans of the Goonies, will always wish to see.

364114,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,6303212379,Mitch Weaver,"[6, 7]","Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg team up to bring us &quot;The Goonies.&quot; The Goonies are a group of kids that love to go on crazy adventures and have a &quot;never say die&quot; attitude. They are being forced out of their homes by a local land developer that wants to build a country club. The only way to save their homes is to come up with enough money to pay off all the back taxes their families owe. Unfortunately, it is a feat that is practically impossible to accomplish. However, The Goonies discover a map that is supposed to lead to the buried treasure of the legendary &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Willie. Determined to keep their homes, the group sets off on a quest to find the rich stuff. Little do they know, that the beginning of the hunt leads to the basement of the local crime family The Fratelis. Now with the Fratelis hot on their tails, they must overcome numerous obstacles and booby traps to find the loot.Sean Astin who is known for his role as Sam in the Lord of the Ring films, offers an outstanding performance as Mikey - the leader of the Goonies. He is the believer of the group and has always loved pirates - especially &quot;One - Eyed&quot; Willie. Johnathan Key Quan plays Data, who is the creative one of the group. He is obsessed with making wacky inventions and none of them work. Corey Feldman is great as Mouth. Mouth is a smart aleck whose mouth always gets the group in trouble. Jeff Cohen probably offers the film's best performance with his portrayal of Chunk. He is the main reason why the film has become such a fan favorite. Chunk is the most entertaining character by far. His constant whining, food cravings, and &quot;truffle shuffle&quot; will have you laughing for the majority of the film. Mikey's older brother Brand ( Josh Brolin), his girlfriend Andi ( Keri Green), and her best friend Stef ( Martha Plimpton) are also great as they come along for the ride. Troy Perkins ( Steve Antin) is the rich and spoiled bully that makes it his mission to terrorize the Goonies. He also has a thing for Andi and is in constant battle with Brand for her affection. The Frateli crime family is great. Mama Frateli (Anne Ramsey) will give you the creeps. Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi play the Frateli brothers Francis and Jake. Their constant bickering and other antics will make you laugh. Then there is Sloth. Sloth is their brother that is disfigured and possesses superhuman strength. They keep him chained in the basement. Sloth however is my favorite character and has a heart that matches the size of his love for Baby Ruth's! The relationship between him and Chunk is very touching.The Goonies is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it maybe a dozen times, and I still love it just as much. Richard Donner does an excellent job directing the vast array of talent in the film. Steven Spielberg crafts an amazing tale of friendship and determination set in extraordinary circumstances. The characters that pave the road for the story are by far the best thing about the film. The visuals in this movie are beautifully done. The underground caverns, the booby traps, the pirate ship, and the treasure all give the film a sense of authenticity when dealing with the pirate genre.The DVD is outstanding. It contains deleted scenes that include a hilarious convienient store scene and the infamous octopus scene. The commentary is the best feature. It brings back all the Goonies and shows them in the booth. You get to see Data, Chunk, Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Stef, and Andi all grown up. It is great to hear what they have to say about working with each other, the characters that they played, and the movie in general. The movie itself and the amazing DVD make it a must own!",5,Fun filled family adventure,1065484800,"10 7, 2003",2003,3724,"['Richard', 'Donner', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'team', 'up', 'bring', 'quot', 'Goonies.', 'quot', 'Goonies', 'are', 'group', 'kids', 'love', 'go', 'crazy', 'adventures', 'have', 'quot', 'never', 'say', 'die', 'quot', 'attitude', 'are', 'being', 'forced', 'homes', 'local', 'land', 'developer', 'build', 'country', 'club', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'homes', 'come', 'up', 'enough', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'back', 'taxes', 'families', 'owe', 'Unfortunately', 'feat', 'practically', 'impossible', 'accomplish', 'However', 'Goonies', 'map', 'supposed', 'lead', 'buried', 'treasure', 'legendary', 'quot', 'One-Eyed', 'quot', 'Willie', 'Determined', 'keep', 'homes', 'group', 'off', 'quest', 'find', 'rich', 'stuff', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'beginning', 'hunt', 'basement', 'local', 'crime', 'family', 'Fratelis', 'Now', 'Fratelis', 'hot', 'tails', 'must', 'overcome', 'numerous', 'obstacles', 'booby', 'traps', 'find', 'loot.Sean', 'Astin', 'who', 'known', 'role', 'Sam', 'Lord', 'Ring', 'films', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Mikey', 'leader', 'Goonies', 'believer', 'group', 'always', 'loved', 'especially', 'quot', 'One', 'Eyed', 'quot', 'Willie', 'Johnathan', 'Key', 'Quan', 'Data', 'who', 'creative', 'one', 'group', 'obsessed', 'making', 'wacky', 'inventions', 'none', 'work', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'great', 'Mouth', 'Mouth', 'smart', 'aleck', 'mouth', 'always', 'group', 'trouble', 'Jeff', 'Cohen', 'probably', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'portrayal', 'Chunk', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'become', 'such', 'fan', 'favorite', 'Chunk', 'most', 'entertaining', 'character', 'far', 'constant', 'whining', 'food', 'cravings', 'quot', 'shuffle', 'quot', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'majority', 'film', 'Mikey', 'older', 'brother', 'Brand', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'girlfriend', 'Andi', 'Keri', 'Green', 'best', 'friend', 'Stef', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'come', 'along', 'ride', 'Troy', 'Perkins', 'Steve', 'Antin', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'bully', 'mission', 'terrorize', 'Goonies', 'also', 'thing', 'Andi', 'constant', 'battle', 'Brand', 'affection', 'Frateli', 'crime', 'family', 'great', 'Mama', 'Frateli', 'Anne', 'Ramsey', 'will', 'give', 'creeps', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Robert', 'Davi', 'play', 'Frateli', 'brothers', 'Francis', 'Jake', 'constant', 'bickering', 'other', 'antics', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'Then', 'Sloth', 'Sloth', 'brother', 'disfigured', 'possesses', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'keep', 'chained', 'basement', 'Sloth', 'however', 'favorite', 'character', 'heart', 'size', 'love', 'Baby', 'Ruth', 'relationship', 'Chunk', 'very', 'touching.The', 'Goonies', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'maybe', 'dozen', 'times', 'still', 'love', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'excellent', 'job', 'directing', 'vast', 'array', 'talent', 'film', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'amazing', 'tale', 'friendship', 'determination', 'set', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'characters', 'pave', 'road', 'story', 'are', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'visuals', 'movie', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'underground', 'caverns', 'booby', 'traps', 'pirate', 'ship', 'treasure', 'give', 'film', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'when', 'dealing', 'pirate', 'genre.The', 'DVD', 'outstanding', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'hilarious', 'convienient', 'store', 'scene', 'infamous', 'octopus', 'scene', 'commentary', 'best', 'feature', 'back', 'Goonies', 'booth', 'get', 'see', 'Data', 'Chunk', 'Mikey', 'Brand', 'Mouth', 'Stef', 'Andi', 'grown', 'up', 'great', 'hear', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'working', 'other', 'characters', 'played', 'movie', 'general', 'movie', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'make', 'must', 'own']",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS

It had enough teen appeal, adventure, kids saving the day and overcoming the fetid stench of corporate corruption to keep us coming back over and over.

This was just before the politically correct 90s, where we would not be allowed to use fat jokes (Chunk's truffle shuffle), making fun of the physically or mentally disabled (the disfigured Sloth being locked in the basement by his ashamed family), or racial sterotypes (Data).What really made this a great DVD was the special features commentary.  Bringing back the original cast to comment on it together made it a truly wonderful experience, as those kids are all about my age, and I lived it once again through their eyes.

Well, it's here, along with some other stuff which you should like.Two. The Cyndi Lauper video. It's nearly 12 minutes long!

I do however know alot about it from the Digital Bits. First off, I am a Goonie Fanatic. It is my favorite movie of all time and I even took the time to visit Astoria Oregon and went the goonie house and other locales when I was on the west coast a while back. To say I wore out the special edition DVD release is an understatement. So when I heard about this new version I was beyond euphoric. I was crushed though when I read what Warner Bros is prepping for said 25th year version. They are basically repackaging the DVD we all have with a new remaster and adding a board game(beyond lame), some promotional magazines(I will take those) and I think a few trading cards or trinkets If I can remember, that's it. Nothing more. Come on Warner Bros, where are the rumored deleted scenes such as the goonies oath scene, the second store visit, the data intimidator scene, the leech scene, the gorilla scene, and extra dialogue. Also how about seamless branching so we can watch the goonies with the existing deleted scenes back into the movie. And it wouldn't hurt either Warner Bros to throw in a new commentary or documentary.

364146,A3I4EX7TBWUT1U,6303212379,"""patrick_mcknight""","[0, 0]","Really I should know better than to enjoy this film that was so obviously made with kids in mind. Yet there was something about this film that I couldn't help but respond to. Maybe it was the fact that I, like the kids in this film grew up in a northwest climate during the eightees. Or maybe it was the fact that I too dreamed of pirates and finding buried treasure as a kid.Anyway, I really did enjoy watching this film. It has suspenseful moments, exciting action sequences, and incredible sets. The kids were all quite likable, indeed I remember kids like the goonies while I was growing up. I think all of us have met people like Chunk at some point, a worrisome, glutinous, but good natured kid. Steven Spielberg wrote the story for this film, and his influence can certainly be felt throughout. Interestingly, the climax of the film foreshadows Spielberg's ""Hook"" which he would make a few years later. I guess making that film was always at the back of his mind.  Richard Donner was the director.  Donner also directed ""Superman"" and adds an amusing little reference to that film.The DVD is well worth purchasing as it allows the film to be shown in its original widescreen aspect ratio. The Goonies was shot as a widescreen film, as a result the pan & scan VHS cuts out a lot of the image making it difficult to see what is going on.",4,Guilty pleasure time.,1027555200,"07 25, 2002",2002,1342,"['Really', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'enjoy', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'obviously', 'made', 'kids', 'mind', 'was', 'something', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'respond', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'kids', 'film', 'grew', 'up', 'northwest', 'climate', 'eightees', 'maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'too', 'dreamed', 'pirates', 'finding', 'buried', 'treasure', 'kid.Anyway', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'incredible', 'sets', 'kids', 'were', 'quite', 'likable', 'indeed', 'remember', 'kids', 'goonies', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'think', 'have', 'met', 'people', 'Chunk', 'point', 'worrisome', 'glutinous', 'good', 'natured', 'kid', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'wrote', 'story', 'film', 'influence', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'felt', 'Interestingly', 'climax', 'film', 'Spielberg', 'Hook', 'would', 'make', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'guess', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'always', 'back', 'mind', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'was', 'director', 'Donner', 'also', 'directed', 'Superman', 'amusing', 'little', 'reference', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'film', 'be', 'shown', 'original', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Goonies', 'was', 'shot', 'widescreen', 'film', 'result', 'pan', 'scan', 'VHS', 'out', 'lot', 'image', 'making', 'difficult', 'see', 'what', 'going']",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS

I had to have it when I discovered it included a commentary featuring all of the Goonies with the director. I begged and pleaded with my parents to get a DVD player so I could see it, and finally, my wish was granted.How could I be disappointed? The movie is fabulous. It is an adventure story and a teen movie mixed into one; it covers the coming of age theme and finding buried treasure at the same time. I know what you're thinking: ""Rubies, and emeralds... and diamonds?"" Yes! A group of kids who call themselve ""The Goonies"" are facing their last days in Astoria, Oregon. Their homes are being taken from them by a rich family who wants to extend their country club over the properties. Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brandon Walsh (Josh Brolin) are brooding in their home when Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Ke Huy Quan) drop by. In their boredom, they decide to explore Mikey's dad's attic where he keeps all of the rejected museum items. There, they find a map showing where the kids can find pirate One Eyed Willie's buried treasure on the coast. Fueled by boredom and a need for money, the kids set out to find it. Brand tries to stop the boys, but consents to go along on the adventure when they meet up with Andie (Kerri Green) and Steph (Martha Plimpton). However, they run into trouble when they find that the place where the treasure is buried is also the hideout of the Fratellis, a group of murderous criminals. Filled with great scenes and great lines, (""I smell ice cream,"" ""That's my mom's most favorite piece,"" ""I'm setting booty traps!"") you'll find yourself quoting this film and talking about it with everyone. It appeals to young and old alike.The extra features are great. Besides the commentary which adds a lot of insight into the hijinx behind the scenes, there are both parts of the Cindi Lauper ""Goonies R Good Enough"" music video, a short featurette with behind the scenes information, and three deleted scenes including the famed octopus scene. Even the main menu is beautifully done.I paid significantly more for this DVD than it is being listed for here, and it was worth what I paid for it and more.

The creative booby-traps are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones, which shouldn't surprise anybody who watches movie credits, and even though the content is most unusual, the movie never loses it's believablity (except, perhaps, during the Superman shirt gag).This may very well be my favorite Spielberg film.",5,Indiana Jones for Kids,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,970,"['Maybe', 'should', 'say', 'teens', 'movie', 'inappropriate', 'language', 'situations', 'first', 'saw', 'Goonies', 'pre-teen', 'years', 'loved', 'Heck', 'continue', 'love', 'even', 'day', 'group', 'kids', 'find', 'treasure', 'map', 'attic', 'full', 'old', 'pirate', 'antiques', 'pretty', 'seamless', 'transition', 'then', 'place', 'considering', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'where', 'kids', 'follow', 'map', 'old', 'abandoned', 'restaurant', 'hideout', 'family', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'rest', 'movie', 'wild', 'chase', 'kids', 'make', 'way', 'booby-trap', 'infested', 'tunnel', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'right', 'tail', 'creative', 'booby-traps', 'are', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'should', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'anybody', 'who', 'movie', 'credits', 'even', 'content', 'most', 'unusual', 'movie', 'never', 'believablity', 'perhaps', 'Superman', 'shirt', 'gag', '.This', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'favorite', 'Spielberg', 'film']",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS

In fact, I didn't miss anything. The story is predictable and the kids chatter so much it was annoying. The adult villains, as usual, are comic caricatures that nobody could possibly be afraid of. No attempt is made to reflect the reality of real kids' lives, and everything, from the Sloth creature to the treasure hunt, is so rooted in fantasyland that you don't believe that any of it could happen in real life. In other words, the film is nothing more than an amusement park ride or a Rube Goldberg project (which it shows again and again). It operates on a purely superficial level - you suspend disbelief and have to ignore all the ridiculous things in it too make it work.I felt many scenes were forced - all the kids' expressions didn't seem natural, but fake, everything was ""on cue""; their laughter or fearful expressions didn't seem inspired or spontaenous. I believe the curse words were put there in a desperate attempt to make the kids sound real, but they just sounded Hollywoodized.In comparison, take a look at the Disney live action kids films of the 70s, like ""Candleshoe"" and ""Escape to Witch Mountain."" Fewer special effects, a bit dated, no curse words, but genuinely moving as well as exciting and the kids were always believable. As it was, this film left me cold.

It was such a success, that I decided this time around to buy it for my own three year old. I figured he may be a little too young, but sometimes, for my own sake, I need to put on something different than the usual cast of cartoons. Within the first five minutes of the film, I thought I was in trouble when Chunk drops the S-H bomb, and my three year old instantly repeated it. At which point his mother yelled from the other room...  ""did he just say...?""  I quickly dodged that bullet though, and, am pleased to say, that the kid really dug the film.  As for me, I find this film to be as enjoyable now, as I ever have. I don't really know why for sure, but I always feel like I did the first time around (was probably seven or eight) digging this cool adventure, where little Mikey gets to make out with Andi. Oh yeah Andi. She could be part of my group of Goonies anyday...I'd be like ""F*** this inhaler!""The bonus features also include the two part video from Cyndi Lauper, which is absolutely a treat, ...even for the kids. It has a few of Cyndis wrestling buddies, Captain Lou, Roddy Piper, and Andre The Giant, as well as a few other familiar faces, in a fun, two part serial, Cyndi Lauper type twist on the Goonies story.

364271,A1S56U8GV9C8F9,6303212379,Wilson Smith,"[3, 3]","The Goonies DVD surpassed my expectations. Ranging from its easy-to-navigate 3-D menus to its extra features, this is certainly one of the most well-realized DVD's yet. The bonus features themselves make up for the long delay in its release. The commentary was undoubtedly the best part of the DVD: 17 years down the line, all seven main characters (&quot;Mikey&quot;, Sean Austin; &quot;Brad&quot;, Josh Brolin; &quot;Chunk&quot;, Jeff Cohen; &quot;Mouth&quot;, Cory Feldman; &quot;Andi&quot;, Kerri Green; &quot;Data&quot;, Ke Huy-Quan; &quot;Stef&quot;, Martha Plimpton; and the director &amp; producer of the film, Richard Donner) gather together and all sit viewing the film in a recording studio, reminiscing about their experience along the way. Most of the cast have changed beyond all recognition, as is evident by the brief &quot;hidden video treasures&quot; which are periodically shown throughout the film in its commentary-enabled mode. All four of the deleted scenes which were shown on the Disney Channel airing, but left out in the final cut, are included as &quot;outtakes&quot;, and high-quality ones at that. It would have been great if, as an extra option, they could be incorporated in the film, but perhaps that's asking a little too much. Both parts of Cyndi Lauper's video, directed by none other that Richard Donner, are included. Along with a trailer which conveys absolutely none of the film's sense of adventure and charm. And last but not least, a 7-minute behind-the-scenes &quot;Making of&quot; which is quite interesting. Speaking as a layman, I found the sound &amp; picture quality of the film absolutely extraordinary, given the time period when this film was made. There are very few negative aspects to this DVD; those there are range from the (minor) fact Warner Bros. opted for a cardboard snap case instead of the more traditional full-sleeve plastic case, to the more significant event of Sean Austin's mysterious &quot;walk-out&quot; in the middle of the commentary feature, to the (even more significant) fact that there weren't any bona fide &quot;outtakes&quot;, nor other unearthed scenes, beyond what was included on the uncut Disney Channel's airing.

364278,A3OI841P5R6FCH,6303212379,Zagnorch,"[2, 5]","Well, gee-whiz! Looks like I'm not the only one who waxes nostalgic about this flick! Of course, having grown up in the 80s, gettin' sentimental over The Goonies  is pretty much a given. How can any self-respecting Gen-Xer NOT be taken back whenever he/she watches this bad-boy? Yeah, see what I mean? Heck, I even remember re-enacting my fave Goonies  moments with the few friends I had way back when. I was always stuck with havin' to play 'Chunk' for obvious reasons (I still do today!) but that's cool, 'cuz he had the best lines anyway! Now I'll admit that doin' the Truffle-Shuffle was sorta lame. But the guy you really hadda feel for was the one who was picked to play Sloth !All right, enough nostalgia now; time for me to break out a proper review. Now if you're lookin' for a synopsis of the flick, take a look at the top of the item page. That having been said, I'm goin' to comment on the picture quality (pretty good, but not quite tops compared to other DVDs in the Warner Bros.  catalogue) and sound quality (above-average; but like the picture quality, Warner  has done better with their other video discs).Now it's on to the special features, of which there are a decent amount. To me the most notable extra feature is the commentary audio track, featuring director Richard Donner and the six Goonies  adventurers, all grown up! Just about everybody throws in an anecdote or two as the flick plays on, except for 'Data ', who had to be prodded into talking by the others on occasion. Sean 'Mikey ' Astin throws in his two cents every once in a while for about the first forty minutes, then mysteriously disappears for the rest of the presentation. And Corey 'Mouth ' Feldman spends quite a few moments takin' shots from his castmates regarding his character's VERY 80s fashion tastes, which included parachute pants and a Prince  Purple Rain  T-shirt!Then there's the behind-the-scenes mini-doc featuring Donner getting things going with the kids, and Executive Producer Steven Spielberg throwing in a few comments about the flick and how it relates to his childhood memories of old-time adventure flicks and stuff. Also of note are the outtakes. The showcase cutting-room scrap: a scene at the local convenience store featuring the fab four of Mikey , Mouth , Data , and Chunk . Personally, I felt this particular bit should've been restored to the movie itself, but then again, it's probably best that they left well enough alone. The rest of the excised snippets include a giant octopus attack in the hidden pirate cove, and a few scene extensions.Last-- and least-- is the two-part Cyndi Lauper Goonies 'R' Good Enough video, which has to be one of the weirdest and dumbest music videos ever produced. It's basically a fifteen-minute-long mini-movie featuring Cyndi going on her very own Goonies -style adventure, with a few of the mo-pic's principals and a lotta WWF stars roundin' out the cast. If you ever thought that Captain Lou Albano, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Classy Freddy Blassie, or Andre The Giant had no acting ability, this unfortunate little ditty-drama will prove you right!Now if only Warner would put their discs in PLASTIC keep cases instead of cardboard, this bad-boy would be near-perfect!'Late",4,I'm takin' 'em ALL back!,1029974400,"08 22, 2002",2002,3230,"['Well', 'gee-whiz', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'nostalgic', 'flick', 'course', 'having', 'grown', 'up', '80s', 'gettin', 'sentimental', 'Goonies', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'How', 'can', 'self-respecting', 'Gen-Xer', 'NOT', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'whenever', 'he/she', 'bad-boy', 'Yeah', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'Heck', 'even', 'remember', 're-enacting', 'fave', 'Goonies', 'moments', 'few', 'friends', 'had', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'always', 'stuck', 'havin', 'play', ""'Chunk"", 'obvious', 'reasons', 'still', 'do', 'today', 'cool', 'had', 'best', 'lines', 'anyway', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'doin', 'Truffle-Shuffle', 'was', 'sorta', 'lame', 'guy', 'really', 'hadda', 'feel', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'picked', 'play', 'Sloth', 'right', 'enough', 'nostalgia', 'now', 'time', 'break', 'out', 'proper', 'review', 'Now', ""'re"", 'lookin', 'synopsis', 'flick', 'take', 'look', 'top', 'item', 'page', 'having', 'been', 'said', ""'m"", 'goin', 'comment', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'quite', 'tops', 'compared', 'other', 'DVDs', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'catalogue', 'sound', 'quality', 'above-average', 'picture', 'quality', 'Warner', 'done', 'better', 'other', 'video', 'discs', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'decent', 'amount', 'most', 'notable', 'extra', 'feature', 'commentary', 'audio', 'track', 'featuring', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'six', 'Goonies', 'adventurers', 'grown', 'up', 'Just', 'everybody', 'throws', 'anecdote', 'two', 'flick', ""'Data"", 'who', 'had', 'be', 'prodded', 'talking', 'others', 'occasion', 'Sean', ""'Mikey"", 'Astin', 'throws', 'two', 'cents', 'once', 'while', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'then', 'mysteriously', 'rest', 'presentation', 'Corey', ""'Mouth"", 'Feldman', 'quite', 'few', 'moments', 'takin', 'shots', 'castmates', 'regarding', 'character', 'VERY', '80s', 'fashion', 'tastes', 'included', 'parachute', 'pants', 'Prince', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'T-shirt', 'Then', 'behind-the-scenes', 'mini-doc', 'featuring', 'Donner', 'getting', 'things', 'going', 'kids', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'throwing', 'few', 'comments', 'flick', 'how', 'childhood', 'memories', 'old-time', 'adventure', 'flicks', 'stuff', 'Also', 'note', 'are', 'outtakes', 'showcase', 'cutting-room', 'scrap', 'scene', 'local', 'convenience', 'store', 'featuring', 'fab', 'four', 'Mikey', 'Mouth', 'Data', 'Chunk', 'Personally', 'felt', 'particular', 'bit', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'restored', 'movie', 'then', 'again', 'probably', 'best', 'left', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'rest', 'excised', 'snippets', 'include', 'giant', 'octopus', 'attack', 'hidden', 'pirate', 'cove', 'few', 'scene', 'extensions.Last', 'least', 'two-part', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'Goonies', 'R', 'Good', 'Enough', 'video', 'be', 'one', 'weirdest', 'dumbest', 'music', 'videos', 'ever', 'produced', 'basically', 'fifteen-minute-long', 'mini-movie', 'featuring', 'Cyndi', 'going', 'very', 'own', 'Goonies', '-style', 'adventure', 'few', 'mo-pic', 'principals', 'lotta', 'WWF', 'roundin', 'cast', 'ever', 'thought', 'Captain', 'Lou', 'Albano', 'Rowdy', 'Roddy', 'Piper', 'Classy', 'Freddy', 'Blassie', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'had', 'acting', 'ability', 'unfortunate', 'little', 'ditty-drama', 'will', 'prove', 'right', 'Now', 'only', 'Warner', 'would', 'put', 'discs', 'PLASTIC', 'keep', 'cases', 'instead', 'cardboard', 'bad-boy', 'would', 'be', 'near-perfect', ""'Late""]",The Goonies Clamshell  VHS
