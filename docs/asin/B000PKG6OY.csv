1071832,AN9J46667D80O,B000PKG6OY,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[10, 12]","""Les Enfants Terrible"" is a collaboration between one of France's greatest authors, Jean Cocteau, and one of its greatest directors, Jean-Pierre Mellville. It should be, and according to many, is, a superb, excellent film. But to me there was something... missing. I don't know what.The plot of the movie centers around a brother and sister who have an unusually close relationship. It's not made clear in the movie if it's an incestual relationship, but the overtones are certainly there (indeed, when they make references to the ""games"" they play, one can easily substitute the word ""sex"", and remove all doubt).Both children, apparently around sixteen, spend a great deal of time isolated in the room they share, and woe betide anyone who invades their sanctum. All is reasonably well until the sister marries a wealthy man, who soon dies, giving her, her brother and their friends a large house to live in.From a technical standpoint a lot to admire in this film. There's a great deal of poetry in the visuals, some wonderful acting, and some powerful dialogue. But for me, as I said, something was missing. I'm not sure what it was. I SHOULD have liked this movie more than I did. Perhaps on subsequent viewings, I will like it more.For now, though, it gets three stars. But at least it's a SOLID three stars, and I certainly don't feel as though I wasted my money by buying it.",3,"Good, but not great, and I don't know why...",1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,1383,"['Les', 'Enfants', 'Terrible', 'collaboration', 'one', 'France', 'greatest', 'authors', 'Jean', 'Cocteau', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Mellville', 'should', 'be', 'according', 'many', 'superb', 'excellent', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'centers', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'have', 'unusually', 'close', 'relationship', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'movie', 'incestual', 'relationship', 'overtones', 'are', 'certainly', 'there', 'indeed', 'when', 'make', 'references', 'games', 'play', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'substitute', 'word', 'sex', 'remove', 'doubt', 'children', 'apparently', 'sixteen', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'isolated', 'room', 'share', 'woe', 'betide', 'anyone', 'who', 'sanctum', 'reasonably', 'well', 'sister', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'soon', 'dies', 'giving', 'brother', 'friends', 'large', 'house', 'live', 'in.From', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'lot', 'admire', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'poetry', 'visuals', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'powerful', 'dialogue', 'said', 'something', 'was', 'missing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'did', 'Perhaps', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'will', 'like', 'more.For', 'now', 'three', 'stars', 'least', 'SOLID', 'three', 'stars', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wasted', 'money', 'buying']",Les Enfants Terribles
1071833,AI2GILPGNEXUL,B000PKG6OY,Clayton,"[0, 0]","The first half of this film is virtually intolerable viewing.  Therein two adults, portraying children, screech and howl at one another in such a cacophonous manner as to drive the viewer to cease watching the film.  The premise of the first half is ludicrous and was based upon an experience of Jean Cocteau's life.  An adolescent crush, object of his hero worship, hits Paul with a snowball, and he nearly dies as a result.  Dargelos, the object of Cocteau's obsession, destroys this film.  Not with acting, but simply by his presence and the cult Cocteau devotes to his worship.  Thus, the first half &#34;Les Enfants Terrible&#34; can be written off as a gay, pubescent crush that serves only as an expression of narcissism.  It was too personal and too self-contained an experience to ever try to bring to film and to convert others to its worship.Now, to the second half of &#34;Les Enfants Terrible&#34;.  It is interesting that both Jean Cocteau and Jean-Pierre Melville both claimed this film as their own.  I surmise it is because they split directing chores.  The second half of the film, from the moment of a minor character's death, is all Jean Cocteau.  Anyone who has viewed &#34;Orphee&#34; or &#34;La Belle et La Bete&#34; will recognize his genius, his poetry, and his cinematic lyricism .If the film had commenced at the point of the minor character's death, I could have hailed it as a masterpiece.",2,Two Directors Wreck A Film,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,1418,"['first', 'half', 'film', 'virtually', 'intolerable', 'viewing', 'Therein', 'two', 'adults', 'portraying', 'children', 'screech', 'howl', 'one', 'cacophonous', 'manner', 'drive', 'viewer', 'cease', 'watching', 'film', 'premise', 'first', 'half', 'ludicrous', 'was', 'based', 'experience', 'Jean', 'Cocteau', 'life', 'adolescent', 'crush', 'object', 'hero', 'worship', 'Paul', 'snowball', 'nearly', 'result', 'Dargelos', 'object', 'Cocteau', 'obsession', 'film', 'Not', 'acting', 'simply', 'presence', 'cult', 'Cocteau', 'worship', 'Thus', 'first', 'half', '34', 'Les', 'Enfants', 'Terrible', '34', 'can', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'gay', 'pubescent', 'crush', 'only', 'expression', 'narcissism', 'was', 'too', 'personal', 'too', 'self-contained', 'experience', 'ever', 'try', 'bring', 'film', 'convert', 'others', 'worship.Now', 'second', 'half', '34', 'Les', 'Enfants', 'Terrible', '34', 'interesting', 'Jean', 'Cocteau', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Melville', 'claimed', 'film', 'own', 'surmise', 'split', 'directing', 'chores', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'moment', 'minor', 'character', 'death', 'Jean', 'Cocteau', 'Anyone', 'who', 'viewed', '34', 'Orphee', '34', '34', 'La', 'Belle', 'La', 'Bete', '34', 'will', 'recognize', 'genius', 'poetry', 'cinematic', 'lyricism', 'film', 'had', 'commenced', 'point', 'minor', 'character', 'death', 'could', 'have', 'hailed', 'masterpiece']",Les Enfants Terribles
1071834,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000PKG6OY,Doug Anderson,"[32, 39]","During the first few minutes I thought Cocteau's Les Enfants Terribles seemed like an odd choice of novels to adapt for a director known for his low view of human nature but that is only because I was not all that familiar with Les Enfants Terribles. The title should have given me a clue but I realized as I watched that Cocteau also is very interested in exploring man's and woman's less seemly side. Furthermore, Melville's gritty noir sensibility is every bit as much on display here in this coming-of-age story as it is in the noir masterpieces that came later. In this adaptation of Cocteau's novel Melville ruminates about the insular world of a brother and sister whose precocious and despotic imaginations are destabilized only by uncertain desires. The two teen siblings are Paul, an ultra-sensitive student who is infatuated with another male student named Dargolos, and Lise, his sister, who has been forced to stay at home to care for their ailing mother. There is an obvious and deeply disturbing symbiotic bond between these two and the unwholesomeness of the bond is immediately apparent. Though they are young there is nothing youthful or innocent about either of them; in fact, much of the time, they seem to act like little blonde fascist versions of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton--as with Taylor and Burton for these two cruelty and seduction are indistinguishable. Just how depravedly selfish these two are, or might be (again, the extent of their depravity is never made explicit) might disgust some viewers. (If the incest topic makes you queasy you should probably stay away from this.)  But even viewers who can handle the topic might be frustrated that Melville does not give us the proper amount of background information on these two to allow us any real depth of insight into the evolution of these two tormented psyches. To be fair, though, Cocteau was writing before Freudian psychoanalysis and the idea that we needed fully fleshed out case histories to understand individual or symbiotically joined psyches had become part of the common culture. As it is Cocteau and Melville only give us bits and pieces of Paul and Lise's psyches and all we can do is make assumptions about what went wrong.  Whether the cause of their rapid slide down the slippery slope of narcissism was lack of a tutor to socialize them or just a result of their having received an overabundance of  creativity and beauty at birth remains a mystery to the end. And we can never say whether Paul's infatuation with Dargolos and then the later infatuation with Agathe was an attempt to replicate his bond with his sister or to escape it. All we really know at films end is that the strange bond that exists between Paul and Lise prevents either of them from bonding with anyone outside their own mutually imagined realm. They do invite two guests to live with them (or, I should say, the two are seduced by Paul and Lise's depraved behavior) but they are welcome only so long as they play by Paul and Lise's very exclusive rules.There is plenty here even for the casual Freudian and those who think deeply about such films will no doubt come up with their own plausible solutions to this brother-sister mystery but, it seems to me, one can only guess at Cocteau's and Melville's intentions--and I think this lack of explicitness is intentional. I can't help presuming that Cocteau is making a point about creativity and dissent and how asocial (anti-bourgeoisie) desires lead to psychological depravity but that judgement relies upon a value system that I do not think Cocteau and Melville necessarily share with the rest of society. More likley its just their own creative prerogotive to acknowledge that such states of desire exist outside the normally sanctioned channels of being.In any event, this is a very creative film that will elicit a variety of responses from Freudians and anti-Freudians alike (I'll be curious to read future posts here).Note: If this kind of thing is your kind of thing you might also like Volker Schlondorff's adaptation of Musil's Young Torless as well as the fictions of Edgar Allen Poe, Thomas Mann, Andre Gide, & Paul Bowles.",4,A Depraved Seduction,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,4170,"['first', 'few', 'minutes', 'thought', 'Cocteau', 'Les', 'Enfants', 'Terribles', 'seemed', 'odd', 'choice', 'novels', 'adapt', 'director', 'known', 'low', 'view', 'human', 'nature', 'only', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'Les', 'Enfants', 'Terribles', 'title', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'clue', 'realized', 'watched', 'Cocteau', 'also', 'very', 'interested', 'exploring', 'man', 'woman', 'less', 'seemly', 'side', 'Furthermore', 'Melville', 'gritty', 'noir', 'sensibility', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'display', 'here', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'noir', 'masterpieces', 'came', 'later', 'adaptation', 'Cocteau', 'novel', 'Melville', 'insular', 'world', 'brother', 'sister', 'precocious', 'despotic', 'imaginations', 'are', 'destabilized', 'only', 'uncertain', 'desires', 'two', 'teen', 'siblings', 'are', 'Paul', 'ultra-sensitive', 'student', 'who', 'infatuated', 'male', 'student', 'named', 'Dargolos', 'Lise', 'sister', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'stay', 'home', 'care', 'ailing', 'mother', 'obvious', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'symbiotic', 'bond', 'two', 'unwholesomeness', 'bond', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'are', 'young', 'nothing', 'youthful', 'innocent', 'fact', 'much', 'time', 'seem', 'act', 'little', 'blonde', 'fascist', 'versions', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Taylor', 'Burton', 'two', 'cruelty', 'seduction', 'are', 'indistinguishable', 'Just', 'how', 'depravedly', 'selfish', 'two', 'are', 'might', 'be', 'again', 'extent', 'depravity', 'never', 'made', 'explicit', 'might', 'disgust', 'viewers', 'incest', 'topic', 'queasy', 'should', 'probably', 'stay', 'away', 'even', 'viewers', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'topic', 'might', 'be', 'frustrated', 'Melville', 'not', 'give', 'proper', 'amount', 'background', 'information', 'two', 'allow', 'real', 'depth', 'insight', 'evolution', 'two', 'tormented', 'psyches', 'be', 'fair', 'though', 'Cocteau', 'was', 'writing', 'Freudian', 'psychoanalysis', 'idea', 'needed', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'case', 'histories', 'understand', 'individual', 'symbiotically', 'joined', 'psyches', 'had', 'become', 'part', 'common', 'culture', 'Cocteau', 'Melville', 'only', 'give', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Paul', 'Lise', 'psyches', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'assumptions', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'cause', 'rapid', 'slide', 'down', 'slippery', 'slope', 'narcissism', 'was', 'lack', 'tutor', 'socialize', 'just', 'result', 'having', 'received', 'overabundance', 'creativity', 'beauty', 'birth', 'mystery', 'end', 'can', 'never', 'say', 'Paul', 'infatuation', 'Dargolos', 'then', 'later', 'infatuation', 'Agathe', 'was', 'attempt', 'replicate', 'bond', 'sister', 'escape', 'really', 'know', 'films', 'end', 'strange', 'bond', 'Paul', 'Lise', 'bonding', 'anyone', 'own', 'mutually', 'imagined', 'realm', 'do', 'invite', 'two', 'guests', 'live', 'should', 'say', 'two', 'are', 'seduced', 'Paul', 'Lise', 'depraved', 'behavior', 'are', 'welcome', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'play', 'Paul', 'Lise', 'very', 'exclusive', 'rules.There', 'plenty', 'here', 'even', 'casual', 'Freudian', 'who', 'think', 'deeply', 'such', 'films', 'will', 'doubt', 'come', 'own', 'plausible', 'solutions', 'brother-sister', 'mystery', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'Cocteau', 'Melville', 'intentions', 'think', 'lack', 'explicitness', 'intentional', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'presuming', 'Cocteau', 'making', 'point', 'creativity', 'dissent', 'how', 'asocial', 'anti-bourgeoisie', 'lead', 'psychological', 'depravity', 'judgement', 'value', 'system', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Cocteau', 'Melville', 'necessarily', 'share', 'rest', 'society', 'More', 'likley', 'just', 'own', 'creative', 'prerogotive', 'acknowledge', 'such', 'states', 'desire', 'exist', 'normally', 'sanctioned', 'channels', 'being.In', 'event', 'very', 'creative', 'film', 'will', 'elicit', 'variety', 'responses', 'Freudians', 'anti-Freudians', ""'ll"", 'be', 'curious', 'read', 'future', 'posts', 'here', '.Note', 'kind', 'thing', 'kind', 'thing', 'might', 'also', 'like', 'Volker', 'Schlondorff', 'adaptation', 'Musil', 'Young', 'Torless', 'as', 'well', 'fictions', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'Thomas', 'Mann', 'Andre', 'Gide', 'Paul', 'Bowles']",Les Enfants Terribles

It's so removed from his milieu that I can't help being reminded of Alfred Hitchcock's involvement with the romantic comedy, MR AND MRS SMITH. It seems, however, that Melville wanted to do it so he has only himself to blame.Here we are treated to a couple of overbearing teenagers orphaned early in the story -- but that doesn't seem to be the cause of the siblings troubles. Their story in the first part of the film is mostly confined to their shared bedroom in which torment each other at the top of their lungs. Some people are fascinated by this psychopathology, but it was pure hell for me.Nicole St&eacute;phane as the sister has been revered for her performance -- yet I found it constantly over-the-top. I tolerated the performance of the actor playing the brother, Edouard Dermithe, better -- while he was roundly jeered by the critics. No doubt, cuz I don't speak French, I am reacting to only part of his performance.An hour into the movie, and 46 minutes before the end, the film finally opens up and shows some momentum. That's about the time the American appears. He sings a pleasant ballad with a pleasant-enuf voice. Then the film begins to descend again, but it ends before it sinks to previous depths.Jean Cocteau's source novel is considered a classic. Many people rank this film as a classic. That may be all you need to know about it.If, like me, you want to see everything Melville did, than you have already decided to see this film.
