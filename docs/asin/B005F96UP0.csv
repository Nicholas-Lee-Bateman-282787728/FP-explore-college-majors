1457789,A3GS7XVYAK31QT,B005F96UP0,David Heeren,"[7, 8]","I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of some old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime I please.So far I&#8217;ve bought DVDs of forty shows. I&#8217;ve found some fine shows, such as Matlock and Trapper John, which I missed the first time around. And I have been disappointed by shows such as The Greatest American Hero and The A Team, which I once enjoyed.No issues with Little House on the Prairie, however. After watching many reruns of all of the great shows, I now consider Little House to be the greatest of all, in a close call with Touched by an Angel.Michael Landon, a genius in all facets of TV &#8211; acting, directing, script writing, producing &#8211; was the mastermind behind Little House. The greatness of the show is evinced in the enduring camaraderie of cast members at reunions. Who could have thought that antagonists Laura Ingalls (Melissa Gilbert) and Nellie Olson (Alison Arngrim) in real life were close friends?This show had the best acting, most interesting and inspirational story lines, clever comedy, serious drama, and the best mood music of all-time.Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10. Jackie Gleason&#8217;s Honeymooners.
