1278682,ALIHO7BMAD8L0,B002MYZYXU,"Charlotte Ellis ""charlottemellis""","[6, 15]","I was looking for an intense cardio workout - this wasn't it.  Very slow beginner moves - and stuff seemed repetitive.  I really wanted cardio, not weights - there was one cardio section and that was over the top.  She went from barely moving to full burpees and pushups.  I did enjoy that cardio part, but it wasn't enough.  I am not a beginner - my favorite cardio workout is the P90X Kenpo Plus workout.",1,Where's the cardio?,1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,406,"['was', 'looking', 'intense', 'cardio', 'was', ""n't"", 'Very', 'slow', 'beginner', 'moves', 'stuff', 'seemed', 'repetitive', 'really', 'wanted', 'cardio', 'not', 'weights', 'was', 'one', 'cardio', 'section', 'was', 'top', 'went', 'barely', 'moving', 'full', 'burpees', 'pushups', 'did', 'enjoy', 'cardio', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'am', 'not', 'beginner', 'favorite', 'cardio', 'workout', 'P90X', 'Kenpo', 'Plus', 'workout']",N/A

The chatter re the heart monitor is a little off putting..Just work out! and the chatter during the work out was useless.

1278685,A1W817C9KE3ZPP,B002MYZYXU,"Nicole Pellegrini ""sockii""","[7, 7]","This is a great workout program for people who enjoy some serious cardio without a lot of ""fancy"" moves or choreography. Jeanette does a great job describing the kicks and punches, doing many of them slow first before full speed, so in a few times through the program you're sure to get the hang of it. It doesn't get boring on repeat viewing, and you will definitely work up a good sweat! The routine is also set up with a few ""breaks"" for strength and weight training, so it's very balanced overall.Overall I definitely recommend the program. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is the music isn't that great, and the camera work is sometimes a bit clumsy. But still, this is one I've certainly added to my regular workout video rotation!",4,Really good workout.,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,751,"['great', 'workout', 'program', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'serious', 'cardio', 'lot', 'fancy', 'moves', 'choreography', 'Jeanette', 'great', 'job', 'describing', 'kicks', 'punches', 'doing', 'many', 'slow', 'first', 'full', 'speed', 'so', 'few', 'times', 'program', ""'re"", 'sure', 'get', 'hang', ""n't"", 'get', 'boring', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'will', 'definitely', 'work', 'up', 'good', 'sweat', 'routine', 'also', 'set', 'up', 'few', 'breaks', 'strength', 'weight', 'training', 'very', 'balanced', 'overall.Overall', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'program', 'only', 'reason', 'give', '4', 'instead', '5', 'stars', 'music', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'clumsy', 'still', 'one', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'added', 'regular', 'workout', 'video', 'rotation']",N/A
