Songwriters own the rights for sales profit as compared to TV re-runs.  In season 5,  Suzi Quatro performs many of her own songs and cover remakes. Actors also may have to paid based on their contract.  This is disappointing because the Ron Howard/Donny Most years made for good TV.  ""Mr. C""  was a great dad because he never tried to be Andy Griffith.  He watched the T.V. football game then helped solve the inner family and friends problems at his own pace.  Tom Bosley as ""Mr. Cunningham"" recently passed away.  He was funny and very 1950's. Season 5 also was the year the trio (Richie, Potsie and Ralph) moved on to college.  Besides rocker Suzi Quatro as Leather Tuscadero, joining the cast was poster boy Scott Baio (Cha Chi) and attractive Lynda Goodfriend ( Lori Beth).  Fonzie (Henry Winkler) made even the weak episodes worth watching.  It's time for those involved to iron out their differences for us fans who followed this show.

The reason we enjoyed it so much was because it was nostalgic, the Fonz was sort of like a plagiarized copy of Elvis Presley, as he looked in his early movies, leather jacket, strut and attitude, also similar to James Dean and Marlon Brando. But with this latest version, all of the original music is gone, except for the karoake singing of Anson Williams and a few songs by Suzi Quatro, So then most fans of the series would rate this season quite highly because they did not grow up with this music, so it wouldn't matter to them that it is all gone, replaced with the most awful generic noise that is barely audible in most episodes.Ron Howard is the best character in the series, he looks and acts like Archie in the popular comics. In fact, most of these plots are like comic book stories, with characters that are more or less one dimensional, Ralph Malph the clown, Potsie kinda bland but part of the band with Ritchie - they sure seem a lot like the Archies without Betty and Veronica, I guess that's one reason to get Suzi Quatro into the group. Joanie, originally good as the smaller sister, as she grew into a teenager, the producers tried to put her into romantic roles, but she never did have the charm of a Sally Field as Gidget, A Patty Duke , an Annette Funicello, a Cherly Holdridge as Wally's girlfriend in Leave It To Beaver, but maybe that's just the way I see it.So the music is gone, making most of these episodes meaningless for the older generation, but as I mentioned before, younger fans will probably not notice. Almost all of the stories center around the Fonz, unlike the earlier years, so basically for me it was too much overkill, I prefer Wonder Years which had stories about all the characters and it was recently announced that the full series, 5 seasons, will be released later this year, so we 'boomers' now have something better to look forward to.",2,Season 5 - The Archie Comics Version,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",2014,2078,"['did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'Fifties', 'then', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'what', 'CBS/Paramount', 'did', 'latest', 'release', 'one', 'most', 'highly', 'rated', 'shows', 'teens', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'was', 'nostalgic', 'Fonz', 'was', 'sort', 'plagiarized', 'copy', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'looked', 'early', 'movies', 'leather', 'jacket', 'strut', 'attitude', 'also', 'similar', 'James', 'Dean', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'latest', 'version', 'original', 'music', 'gone', 'karoake', 'singing', 'Anson', 'Williams', 'few', 'songs', 'Suzi', 'Quatro', 'So', 'then', 'most', 'fans', 'series', 'would', 'rate', 'season', 'quite', 'highly', 'did', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'music', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'gone', 'replaced', 'most', 'awful', 'generic', 'noise', 'barely', 'audible', 'most', 'episodes.Ron', 'Howard', 'best', 'character', 'series', 'like', 'Archie', 'popular', 'comics', 'fact', 'most', 'plots', 'are', 'comic', 'book', 'stories', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'one', 'dimensional', 'Ralph', 'Malph', 'clown', 'Potsie', 'kinda', 'bland', 'part', 'band', 'Ritchie', 'sure', 'seem', 'lot', 'Archies', 'Betty', 'Veronica', 'guess', 'one', 'reason', 'get', 'Suzi', 'Quatro', 'group', 'Joanie', 'originally', 'good', 'smaller', 'sister', 'grew', 'teenager', 'producers', 'tried', 'put', 'romantic', 'roles', 'never', 'did', 'have', 'charm', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Gidget', 'A', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'Cherly', 'Holdridge', 'Wally', 'girlfriend', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'maybe', 'just', 'way', 'see', 'music', 'gone', 'making', 'most', 'episodes', 'meaningless', 'older', 'generation', 'mentioned', 'younger', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'notice', 'Almost', 'stories', 'center', 'Fonz', 'earlier', 'years', 'so', 'basically', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'overkill', 'prefer', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'had', 'stories', 'characters', 'was', 'recently', 'announced', 'full', 'series', '5', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'later', 'year', ""'boomers"", 'now', 'have', 'something', 'better', 'look', 'forward']",Happy Days: Season 5

1220029,A1KDCQJVWW5S6E,B001NGPLCM,Mr. x,"[1, 3]","Although the picture does look fabulous and there are a lot of episodes I love.... CBS DVD/Paramount has yet again replace most (not all) the original music in the show with generic music.You still get a few original songs (ex. the songs in the episode ""Be My Valentine"" and a couple of songs sung by Leather Tuscadero, as well as Potsie singing a few songs here and there).But for the most part it is disappointing regarding the replacement music - especially when a character is singing lyrics to songs (ex. Fonzie singing the lines in ""Cream In My Coffee"" and Postie/Ralph singing a line from ""Tea For Two"").  The worst scene is where Leather (and the band) go through the motions of playing/singing ""Johnny B. Goode"" with a generic instrumental (where Leather is seen moving her mouth to an instrumental!)....Of course as other reviewer has pointed out - there's only a piano instrumental during the flashback scene in ""Richie's Accident"" instead of Leather singing a touching song (what is the name of this song?)Overall I'd rate this a C only on the basis that the Music is replaced.  The picture and episodes are still good (and for the most part unedited).....Somewhat disappointing after the improvement of Seasons 3 & 4.",3,"Another Great Season, Another so-so DVD Set.",1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,1230,"['picture', 'look', 'fabulous', 'are', 'lot', 'episodes', 'love', 'CBS', 'DVD/Paramount', 'yet', 'again', 'replace', 'most', 'not', 'original', 'music', 'show', 'generic', 'music.You', 'still', 'get', 'few', 'original', 'songs', 'ex', 'songs', 'episode', 'Be', 'Valentine', 'couple', 'songs', 'sung', 'Leather', 'Tuscadero', 'as', 'well', 'Potsie', 'singing', 'few', 'songs', 'here', 'there', '.But', 'most', 'part', 'disappointing', 'regarding', 'replacement', 'music', 'especially', 'when', 'character', 'singing', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'ex', 'Fonzie', 'singing', 'lines', 'Cream', 'My', 'Coffee', 'Postie/Ralph', 'singing', 'line', 'Tea', 'Two', 'worst', 'scene', 'where', 'Leather', 'band', 'go', 'motions', 'playing/singing', 'Johnny', 'B.', 'Goode', 'generic', 'instrumental', 'where', 'Leather', 'seen', 'moving', 'mouth', 'instrumental', '.Of', 'course', 'other', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'only', 'piano', 'instrumental', 'flashback', 'scene', 'Richie', 'Accident', 'instead', 'Leather', 'singing', 'touching', 'song', 'what', 'name', 'song', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'rate', 'C', 'only', 'basis', 'Music', 'replaced', 'picture', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'unedited', '..Somewhat', 'disappointing', 'improvement', 'Seasons', '3', '4']",Happy Days: Season 5
