Some what creepy,  not overly scary but a bit creepy. If you are into ghost movies its worth the buy. check it out, rent it, buy it what ever I personally wouldnt buy it cause Im more of a slasher/zombie fan.But a solid movie with a very cool plot, very good acting,  good pace never gets boring and stays quit interesting, and keeps you focused and awake.

Its main problem is all too simple to identify: the movie lacks a single empathetic, much less likable, character. This main flaw is backed up by any number of others, most notably the writing, which sounds more like a bad pop song than a film script much of the time (does any sober person over the age of sixteen actually use the phrase ""this is my solemn promise"" in a sentence?). But why stop there? We could go on all day about the terrible lighting (even in the outdoor shots!), some odd sound anomalies,  the barely-competent cinematography, etc. By halfway through this movie I was attempting to watch it with just half an eye in order to preserve what little was left of my sanity.
