802845,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0001EQI7E,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[7, 11]","This has to be one of the lamest films I've ever seen, made on what must have been a shoe-string budget, but it is also, perhaps because I like the premise, quite entertaining; the script meanders, and one has to wonder how much was actually written down, and how much was on the fly improvisation...as some of it sounds like what one can hear in an acting class exercise.It is an end-times plot that centers on three young lawyers who go to Manila on a case, are warned by a blind man to repent because the end of the world is at hand, and lo and behold ! the blind man was right.There is a nifty rapture sequence on a bridge, and some nice cheesy special effects afterwards, with hail as big as bowling balls, and the sea turning red with blood, as they wander around in a ""hell on earth"" scenario looking for water, which is now the world's most precious commodity, and ponder the existence of God.Starring two actors from the ""Survivor"" TV series, Dirk Been and Joel Klug, Philippine actress Bianca Lapus, as well as Tim Chey, who wrote, directed, and produced this film (Tim also directed ""Fakin' Da Funk"" in '97), and it has a score by Daniel Bijan and Sherwin Castillo, which features some pleasant songs.This movie is not as brain-dead as some of the fare that Hollywood dishes out, and despite its 101 flaws, remains watchable, and is short and sweet at  77 minutes.""You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart"" Jeremiah 29:13.",3,"""livin' la vida loca in hell""",1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,1459,"['be', 'one', 'lamest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'made', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'shoe-string', 'budget', 'also', 'perhaps', 'like', 'premise', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'script', 'meanders', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'actually', 'written', 'down', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'fly', 'improvisation', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'acting', 'class', 'exercise.It', 'end-times', 'plot', 'centers', 'three', 'young', 'lawyers', 'who', 'go', 'Manila', 'case', 'are', 'warned', 'blind', 'man', 'repent', 'end', 'world', 'hand', 'lo', 'behold', 'blind', 'man', 'was', 'right.There', 'nifty', 'rapture', 'sequence', 'bridge', 'nice', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'afterwards', 'hail', 'as', 'big', 'bowling', 'balls', 'sea', 'turning', 'red', 'blood', 'wander', 'around', 'hell', 'earth', 'scenario', 'looking', 'water', 'now', 'world', 'most', 'precious', 'commodity', 'ponder', 'existence', 'God.Starring', 'two', 'actors', 'Survivor', 'TV', 'series', 'Dirk', 'Been', 'Joel', 'Klug', 'Philippine', 'actress', 'Bianca', 'Lapus', 'as', 'well', 'Tim', 'Chey', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'produced', 'film', 'Tim', 'also', 'directed', 'Fakin', 'Da', 'Funk', ""'97"", 'score', 'Daniel', 'Bijan', 'Sherwin', 'Castillo', 'pleasant', 'songs.This', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'brain-dead', 'fare', 'Hollywood', 'out', '101', 'flaws', 'watchable', 'short', 'sweet', '77', 'minutes', 'will', 'seek', 'find', 'when', 'seek', 'heart', 'Jeremiah', '29:13']",Gone

802848,A1PIDV6SKBLFQ2,B0001EQI7E,"SCMLA ""SoCal Martial Law Alerts""","[6, 8]","I appreciated the unique take on this one -- it's NOT just your typical the-whole-world-revolves-around-us-Americans-even-during-the-rapture flick. No, although the plot does revolve around 3 Americans, it sets them down in an exotic location (the Philippines) & challenges them to get back home (to America) after the rapture hits.Which I think effectively drives home the fact that EVERYONE -- all over the world! -- will be affected by the rapture. Everyone EVERYWHERE will be disoriented & afraid. And EVERYTHING will change.I do agree that the plot meanders a bit, but, then again, the 3 hotshot American attorneys were in the Philippines on a mission: to defend their multi-national client. So, when the rapture hit, it completely threw them off-course. Their ""mission"" then became a matter of survival & an attempt to escape a foreign country that was quickly threatening to become their prison &/or their collective graveyard.And, for that reason, I think the movie works.That said, I did enjoy the movie a lot better the second time around with the director's commentary on. Even so, I'm still wondering why the trip to the top of the cross had to be made? It was very dramatic & resolved things for each of the characters involved, but it just seemed so unnecessary ... Did I miss something?I also love the soundtrack (I'm referring to the CD) -- the opening track is very moving. Definitely worth having.",5,GONE in the twinkling of an eye ...,1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,1415,"['appreciated', 'unique', 'take', 'one', 'NOT', 'just', 'typical', 'the-whole-world-revolves-around-us-Americans-even-during-the-rapture', 'flick', 'No', 'plot', 'revolve', '3', 'Americans', 'down', 'exotic', 'location', 'Philippines', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'America', 'rapture', 'hits.Which', 'think', 'effectively', 'home', 'fact', 'EVERYONE', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'rapture', 'Everyone', 'EVERYWHERE', 'will', 'be', 'disoriented', 'afraid', 'EVERYTHING', 'will', 'change.I', 'do', 'agree', 'plot', 'bit', 'then', 'again', '3', 'hotshot', 'American', 'attorneys', 'were', 'Philippines', 'mission', 'defend', 'multi-national', 'client', 'So', 'when', 'rapture', 'hit', 'completely', 'threw', 'off-course', 'mission', 'then', 'became', 'matter', 'survival', 'attempt', 'escape', 'foreign', 'country', 'was', 'quickly', 'threatening', 'become', 'prison', '/or', 'collective', 'graveyard.And', 'reason', 'think', 'movie', 'said', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'director', 'commentary', 'Even', 'so', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'why', 'trip', 'top', 'cross', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'very', 'dramatic', 'resolved', 'things', 'characters', 'involved', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'unnecessary', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'also', 'love', 'soundtrack', ""'m"", 'referring', 'CD', 'opening', 'track', 'very', 'moving', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'having']",Gone

Yet the dreamlike quality of the film--similar to Eyes Wide Shut--the emptiness of the sets (Manila is NOT a sparcely populated city!) and the poor sound quality of the dialogue all made this a difficult watch.  Additionally, the ""wonder if God is real"" and ""how can a loving God allow so much evil"" dialogue seemed more like what you would hear in college dorms then at the end of the world.GONE fits in the Christian apocalytic genre, and as such, should be able to compete against the Left Behind movies, the Apoclypse series, and Omega Code I & II.  This one settles at least one, if not two tiers below these others, and even they generally only rate 3-stars.Bottom-line:  There are better films in this genre, and still Christians are awaiting a five-star production with the power of the Passion of the Christ, to communicate the all important message that the Day of Judgment is real and imminent!

The acting is very weak, the story predictable and very dry, and the feel of the movie? Over-dramatic. Most Christians are accustomed to the many bad films currently flooding the Christian market - Megiddo, etc. This is another.This movie came out about the same time as the Passion of the Christ, and was marketed extensively on Google. I decided to buy it, and after watching the first 15 minutes, felt like I was not being a good steward of my money.Christian film makers need to begin with a good story if they want to catch the eye of non-Christians, and not just with over-dramatic threats. No non-Christian takes this hokey, cartoonish cinema seriously. God didn't give us creative skills to make caricatures of ourselves.Horrendous filmmaking.
