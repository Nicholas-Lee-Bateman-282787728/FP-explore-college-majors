821748,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00022FWTA,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 5]","I will admit, I was a fan of the first film.  While I didn't think it was one of the greatest films created, I did think that it had quite a bit of potential coupled with ample originality.  It was fun, exciting, and it seemed like everyone involved seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I only with that I could say the same for the sequel, Agent Cody Banks: Destination London.  From the opening sequence of this film you could sense an aura of dislike, repetitiveness, and simple futility.  Nobody, not even Frankie Muniz himself, seemed like they were bringing the same level of excitement to this project.  Also, the level of originality was completely below par for this sequel.  If you, like myself, brought any excitement from the first film to this one, it will be completely destroyed.  Nothing worked in this movie, from the jokes, to the ""spy"" story, it just seemed flat and disrespectful.My first issue is with the cast.  If this was a true sequel, I think the producers could have budgeted a bit more to see about getting the original characters back.  I understand that perhaps Hillary Duff's paycheck had risen since the original film, but she did bring something (as embarrassing as it is to say) to Agent Cody Banks that kept the spark alive.  As did everyone else involved, sadly, Anthony Anderson (one of the most overused comic actors of this decade) brought nothing to the table.  His jokes seemed generic and, honestly, repetitive.  He had no character, all I could witness was Anthony Anderson being Anthony Anderson.  They attempted to bring sympathy to his character by giving him this sub-story about being the ""black"" sheep of the CIA, but in my eyes it just wasn't enough.  Anderson was just trying to showcase his ""talent"" so that he can continue to live the lifestyle that he has built.  It was sad, and really hurt this film.  Second, was Muniz himself.  The bond between him and Hannah Spearritt was poor.  I am not sure who the casting agent was on this project, but there was no chemistry between these two actors.  They continued to prove that by reading your lines and walking the steps, you could inherit a $5 million dollar paycheck.  Nobody cared, nobody stopped, they just continued to make this cheapened sequel.Next issue, where was the story?  The first film carried with it some decent events that built a strong story which ultimately lead to a better than average film, but it seemed like in this sequel they aimed towards children and empty minds.  In most film sequels, they use a similar plot structure to give the audience a sensation of relaxation, while simultaneously building different elements to keep our attention.  Well, none of that was used in this film.  Instead, we find ourselves with a cheapened story that results in dogs playing piano and a very unspooky villain.  In fact, I couldn't even tell you who the true bad guy was of this film, and that is a perfect sign that your film is struggling.  This story just felt as if it was unfinished, as if the original screenplay was not dumbened down for children, but instead built another strong adventure, but the studio wanted to capture the child audience, so the butchered the product, leaving frayed edges and unfinished segments, so that they could make room for Anthony Anderson's cheap laughs.  Yet again, proving the pathetic nature of the film.  I went into this story expecting to be completely surprised, yet somehow walked away without any recollection of what I just experienced.  It was the perfect example of a how a sequel should not be structured or released.Finally, I would like to say that if you have a film that seems to do somewhat well at the box office, there should be no need to rush right into a sequel, especially if you see a growing decrease in the excitement behind Malcolm in the Middle.  Frankie Muniz is a decent actor, but when handed poor material, he will not fray from making it exceptionally poor.  He is one of those actors that brings good things to great material, but will falter if handed unseasonable stuff.  I do not see a bright future for Muniz due to his ability to stray from decency.  This could have been a powerful sequel, but instead Hollywood yet again strayed towards the side of childish behavior instead of truthful storytelling.Overall, this film lacked the fun of the first film.  With unfamiliar characters, comedy that seemed forced and incoherent instead of funny, and a story that had that cheapened Velcro feel to it, Agent Cody Banks 2 proved that jumping to quickly into a sequel will place a black cloud on your entire series.  While once I had considered this to be an interesting and highly original concept, I now have second thoughts.  I am not sure that Muniz was prepared for such a cheap sequel, and therefore he signed too quickly.  I do not recommend this film to anyone that enjoyed the first film, or at least was under the impression that the first film was decent.  This was a horrible sequel that should have never seen the light of day.

Not once did he thank ANYBODY for helping him get to where he was, other than himself. Not even his family.Well, I'll tell you what, Frankie Muniz would be absolutely nowhere if it weren't for the WRITERS of ""Malcolm in the Middle"". The key to Muniz's success was that he was a normal looking kid with a hint of dorkiness and whole lot of luck... then the writers and directors for the show did their magic.Agent Cody Banks 2 is pointless and more importantly, a movie that strokes the ego of an actor that needs no more ego stroking.The movie is poorly thought out, unfunny, and an obvious attempt at a hurry up and capitalize off of the flash in the pan success that is Frankie Muniz. No script. No thought. Ridiculous scenes that have our SUPEREGO star singing ""War! What is it Good for?"" at a world leaders meeting.

After tackling his domestic American homeland with sheer machoism and a dedicated bravery, Agent Banks (Frankie Muniz) is off on another dangerously exciting adventure, except this installment takes place in jolly old London. Agent Banks, with an endless arsenal of gadgets in hand, must take on a madman head-to head, who's intent is to control the world's monetary supply through means of an orally-implanted microchip, which makes robots out of humans. Banks is sent to London in the guise of a music student, so as not to blow any sort of cover as a CIA spy.

821759,A319SKSB556033,B00022FWTA,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[4, 14]","Agent Cody Banks 2 is, with no doubt, the most useless, redundant and unasked-for sequel since WWII. No one wanted a sequel and the only reason it exists is to cash in on the modest, modest, incredibly modest 'success' of the original. The plan didn't work as this quite deservedly bombed horribly.Even in the 2-second gap between this and the first Frankie Munitz hasn't aged well. And he's quite aggravating. Hilary Duff wisely bailed out and her character is replaced by some untalented non-celeb former pop-babe.

821778,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00022FWTA,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 3]","""Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London"" is the sequel to a film that I confess I've never actually seen.  Based on what I HAVE seen here, I'm not sure I missed all that much the first time around.For those unfamiliar with the premise, Banks is an under-aged spy who works for the CIA, sort of a teenaged James Bond for the Doogie Howser set.  In this installment in the series, the organization sends Banks on an undercover mission to England to seek out and destroy a mind control machine that one of its rogue agents (who's feeling unappreciated and slighted by the agency) is now helping to develop and finance for his own nefarious purposes.This is harmless enough wish-fulfillment fantasy for youngsters, I suppose, but adults forced to sit through it with them will quickly find themselves irritated and bored by all the lowbrow shenanigans.  There's a very funny scene up front in which we see how the kids' spy training facility is converted into an innocuous summer camp to fool the parents on visiting day, but, I'm afraid, this cleverness soon gives way to an inordinately silly plot and a succession of tired chase sequences.  Although the gadgets are cool, there aren't enough of them to distract us from the appalling overacting on the part of virtually the entire cast, including Frankie Muniz who, though a likable young performer on ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" is here forced to wear a single expression of pained disbelief throughout.  As an actor of undeniable talent and charm, hopefully he'll get the opportunity to tackle more varied and mature roles in the near future and won`t go the way of so many other juvenile performers - that of being stuck in roles for which he is too old and thus failing to make that successful leap from child star to adult actor.",2,Call Frankie's Agent!,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,1780,"['Agent', 'Cody', '2', 'Destination', 'London', 'sequel', 'film', 'confess', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'Based', 'what', 'HAVE', 'seen', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'missed', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'unfamiliar', 'premise', 'Banks', 'under-aged', 'spy', 'who', 'CIA', 'sort', 'teenaged', 'James', 'Bond', 'Doogie', 'Howser', 'set', 'installment', 'series', 'organization', 'Banks', 'undercover', 'mission', 'England', 'seek', 'out', 'destroy', 'mind', 'control', 'machine', 'one', 'rogue', 'agents', 'who', 'feeling', 'unappreciated', 'slighted', 'agency', 'now', 'helping', 'develop', 'finance', 'own', 'nefarious', 'purposes.This', 'harmless', 'enough', 'wish-fulfillment', 'fantasy', 'youngsters', 'suppose', 'adults', 'forced', 'sit', 'will', 'quickly', 'find', 'irritated', 'bored', 'lowbrow', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'up', 'front', 'see', 'how', 'kids', 'spy', 'training', 'facility', 'converted', 'innocuous', 'summer', 'camp', 'fool', 'parents', 'visiting', 'day', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'cleverness', 'soon', 'way', 'inordinately', 'silly', 'plot', 'succession', 'tired', 'chase', 'sequences', 'gadgets', 'are', 'cool', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'distract', 'appalling', 'overacting', 'part', 'virtually', 'entire', 'cast', 'including', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'who', 'likable', 'young', 'performer', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'here', 'forced', 'wear', 'single', 'expression', 'pained', 'disbelief', 'actor', 'undeniable', 'talent', 'charm', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'opportunity', 'tackle', 'more', 'varied', 'mature', 'roles', 'near', 'future', 'won', 't', 'go', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'juvenile', 'performers', 'being', 'stuck', 'roles', 'too', 'old', 'thus', 'failing', 'make', 'successful', 'leap', 'child', 'star', 'adult', 'actor']",Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London

821784,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00022FWTA,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","I liked the idea of the half-pint James Bond-like secret agent  played by Frankie Muniz aka 'Agent Cody Banks.'  The story is not exceptionally original, but Muniz, a decent actor I suppose, carried the whole film pretty well, which was enjoyable to see.Now, finally I saw the sequel, which turned out a big disappointment.  First, you realize that everything is missing from the sequel, I mean, everything that made the original film quite a unique one.  Here, 'Cody' is no longer timid or feels intimidated before women; he just acts like an ordinary American teenager, but this time he is in London!  That's all, and Cody is assigned a job to retrieve the high-tech mind-control device that might be used to control the world's leaders at G7 (or G8 ... whatever).  But ... why do they need special agent Cody instead of ordinary spy like James Bond or any spies you can name?Because Cody has to get close to the prime suspect, who owns a boarding school, where Cody must be placed.  And for the successful mission, Cody must not disclose his identity before the kids (who wouldn't believe such nonsense anyway).  My question: Do you believe in this poorly written plot, or, more to the point, DO you care?If you should care, that's because of romance.  In the sequel, you see no Hilary Duff, who was not bad in the first film.  Instead, you get Hannah Spearritt (ex 'S-Club'), but between Muniz and her there is no chemistry.  Add to that, the gadgets are unimaginative ones; the locations are all shot like post-cards.  Side kick Anthony Anderson is same old Anthony Anderson, who is certainly funny, but we know he could be much more funny with better materials, better than doing unfunny slapsticks in the kitchen.I read that the film's script was being written during the shooting.  What were they thinking?  Did director Kevin Allen approve that?  Did MGM need the sequel that desperately?  Or quickly?  Because Frankie Muniz was reaching the age of 20, no longer a 'teenager,' no 'Cody Banks'?  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure that as far as the script is concerned, the film is a very lazy, unfunny, unexciting comedy of which sole merit is that it was shot in London.
