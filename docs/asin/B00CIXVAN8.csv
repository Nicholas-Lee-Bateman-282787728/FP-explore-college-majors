The CONS of Now You See Me, and then PROS are conjured up by me below. AlakaZAM! Let us begin.CONS:  Breezy fun as it might be, when the movie tries to be serious it fails miserably. When the movie races at fast-pace, giving us sleight of hand, impossible feats of magic, and witty banter, all is fine and dandy. When Now You See Me tries to explain itself logically, it comes off as trying too hard. As Michael Caine says in The Prestige, we _want to be fooled. But we don't want to be cheated, and the admittedly unforseen twist ending was shocking for one breathless second, until we realized how extraordinarily unlikely, impossible, and silly it actually was. And also, the use of CGI for magic is a dubious choice. When we know what we are seeing onscreen was generated by computers and some greenscreen, it's harder to feel amazed and awed by the spectacular tricks.PROS: But hey, I'm taking this too seriously! NYSM is the perfect film for a night of carefree entertainment. Now You See Me combines healthy doses of action, humour, twists and turns, suspense, and a fresh sense of fun to make one of the rare original but engaging blockbusters out this year. It's no wonder Now You See Me was a surprise hit, outgrossing The Lone Ranger and Pacific Rim in the States.It's success is due in no small part to it's talented and diverse cast.Jesse Eisenbergplays smug, difficult know-it-alls like he was born to, and his illusionist J. Daniel Atlas is right on the money.Woody Harrelson's obnoxious mentalist Merritt is one of the highlights of the film. In the supporting cast, Isla Fisher shows her talent and charm and Dave Franco is charming and cool as a pickpocketing magician.Mark Ruffalohas little to do but look confused and be ten steps behind everything else, but his final twist gives him some gravity, and he's got most of the funny bits. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are woefully underused. Not once did Caine ask if we were watching closely. But Caine is a remarkably suave gent, and Freeman makes every movie he's in 33.33% better. Quote me on that.By no accounts a truly GREAT film, Now You See Me successfully treads the thin line between silly and utterly entertaining by welcoming and embracing it's own silliness straight out of the door. You should even have such a great time that you forget that the plot is nonsensical and the twist at the end makes no sense. So come in close, because the more you actually see, the easier it will be...to have a great time at the movies.My rating? 4 of hearts out of 5.",4,Come in close...but leave your brain at the door!,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,2753,"['Now', 'See', 'hit', 'caper', 'thriller', 'fromLouis', 'Leterrier', 'up', 'most', 'fast-paced', 'glitzy', 'action-packed', 'twisty-turny', 'fun', 'crowd-pleasing', 'cocktail', 'imaginable', 'forgets', 'make', 'make', 'sense', 'CONS', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'then', 'PROS', 'are', 'conjured', 'up', 'AlakaZAM', 'Let', 'begin.CONS', 'Breezy', 'fun', 'might', 'be', 'when', 'movie', 'be', 'serious', 'miserably', 'When', 'movie', 'races', 'fast-pace', 'giving', 'sleight', 'hand', 'impossible', 'feats', 'magic', 'witty', 'banter', 'fine', 'dandy', 'When', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'tries', 'explain', 'logically', 'off', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Prestige', '_want', 'be', 'fooled', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'cheated', 'admittedly', 'unforseen', 'twist', 'ending', 'was', 'shocking', 'one', 'breathless', 'second', 'realized', 'how', 'extraordinarily', 'unlikely', 'impossible', 'silly', 'actually', 'was', 'also', 'use', 'CGI', 'magic', 'dubious', 'choice', 'When', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'onscreen', 'was', 'generated', 'computers', 'greenscreen', 'harder', 'feel', 'amazed', 'awed', 'spectacular', 'tricks.PROS', 'hey', ""'m"", 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'NYSM', 'perfect', 'film', 'night', 'carefree', 'entertainment', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'combines', 'healthy', 'doses', 'action', 'humour', 'twists', 'turns', 'suspense', 'fresh', 'sense', 'fun', 'make', 'one', 'rare', 'original', 'engaging', 'blockbusters', 'out', 'year', 'wonder', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'was', 'surprise', 'hit', 'outgrossing', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Pacific', 'Rim', 'States.It', 'success', 'due', 'small', 'part', 'talented', 'diverse', 'cast.Jesse', 'Eisenbergplays', 'smug', 'difficult', 'know-it-alls', 'was', 'born', 'illusionist', 'J.', 'Daniel', 'Atlas', 'right', 'money.Woody', 'Harrelson', 'obnoxious', 'mentalist', 'Merritt', 'one', 'highlights', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'talent', 'charm', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'charming', 'cool', 'pickpocketing', 'magician.Mark', 'Ruffalohas', 'little', 'do', 'look', 'confused', 'be', 'ten', 'steps', 'everything', 'else', 'final', 'twist', 'gravity', 'got', 'most', 'funny', 'bits', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'are', 'woefully', 'underused', 'Not', 'once', 'did', 'Caine', 'ask', 'were', 'watching', 'closely', 'Caine', 'remarkably', 'suave', 'gent', 'Freeman', 'movie', '33.33', '%', 'better', 'Quote', 'that.By', 'accounts', 'truly', 'GREAT', 'film', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'successfully', 'thin', 'line', 'silly', 'utterly', 'entertaining', 'welcoming', 'embracing', 'own', 'silliness', 'straight', 'door', 'should', 'even', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'time', 'forget', 'plot', 'nonsensical', 'twist', 'end', 'sense', 'So', 'come', 'close', 'more', 'actually', 'see', 'easier', 'will', 'be', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'movies.My', 'rating', '4', 'hearts', '5']",N/A

Harsh ?  Actually, I'm being kind.The best way to describe what's 'wrong' with this movie is as such :  It is incredibly impressed with it's own self whilst being utterly pointless and DRASTICALLY flawed in it's premise, story, and plot.  The movie has ZERO concern for the viewer's brain, and it's ONLY positive attribute is that it's cinematographer was good at his job.  You're expected to buy into one outlandishly preposterous circumstance after another, whilst the pace of the movie is meant to PREVENT you from actually following what's going on.  This is not a coincidence, because [as you start to suspect less than half way through], there IS nothing to 'get'.  It is just one fast-edited piece of pointless eye candy after another, all sewn together to form a gigantic, steaming turd, alas, a turd painted with gold paint and covered with sparkles in order to mask and hide its stench.  All the while, you're expecting that it'll come together and make sense at the end, which is the ONLY reason you'll push forward, because, you simply can't bring yourself to 'believe' that it could be as pointless and flawed and empty as your suspicions are telling you it is, but in fact, the ending is VOID, as in TOTALLY VOID of any shred of merit or believable point.If you're someone who smokes e-cigarettes, watches gutter-brain reality tv shows, and buys into anything that comes down the road, then perhaps you might be just the audience this movie was shooting for, in which case, I feel sorry for you.

Well, the fact that it had some good actors and a interesting concept certainly got my emotions. I was excited to see it. But then my logic tried to justify it to no avail. Here are some problems I had. First of all, I immediately noticed that Jesse was playing the same character as he did in The Social Network. You know, a brilliant-minded prick. And is there any different role for Morgan Freeman to play other than an old wise owl? Woody plays the typical role he's played since White Men Can't Jump. Ruffalo was so angry all the time in the film I expected him to turn into the Hulk at any moment. As far as the other characters, I was not familiar with them. The Interpol agent was pretty and...that's pretty much that about her. Now to the concept: We see the stunts and they get explained to us. That about sums up the plot. Then there was this eye of something thing. The whole movie goes to great lengths to show us basically what magic is, but then tries to say magic is real. So basically, though I wanted to get into some cool story that hasn't been done before (at least to my knowledge) I wasn't really invited ""in"" (those who watch should know what I mean). One last thing: Where was the production crew during all of this? You can't tell me the Three Horse Men w/One Horse Lady were able to set all the events up by themselves.

1647609,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00CIXVAN8,Chris Kennison,"[3, 5]","It's inevitable that you go into every movie expecting something. For ""Now You See Me"", I expected to see a movie about magicians, obviously, but to have a bunch of dazzling tricks that weren't humanly possibly and they would go unexplained; as if they were possessed by some other-worldly entity. There is that scene in the trailer where the four-horsemen (their magician team stage name) leap from a building and magically turn into hundreds and thousands of floating dollars. So, I figured that would be the case for the movie because that was a brilliant piece of editor magic at work in that particular shot.  I was wrong.""Now You See Me"" starts off introducing us to four different magicians, two are well known, one is on her way up and one uses his skills as a common street thief. Together, they are brought to a locked room in a dingy hotel by a mysterious benefactor and coaxed to become a team in order to achieve a certain goal. That goal is a mystery to us as is most of the movie. The movie then cuts to just a year later and the four magicians have become the Four-horsemen, a daring magician team that quickly becomes the talk of the world after just their first show.Now I'm not gonna go into any more details about the movie because that is all the fun. Just like any magic trick, you don't want to know how it was done, you want to see it for yourself and figure it out for yourself. That is what I truly liked about ""Now You See Me"". The movie itself is a magic trick. It doesn't rely on unexplained special effects. In fact, they explain nearly every single trick in the movie and how it was done. That adds to the quality of the movie because even though they are telling you how tricks are done, you are only enlightened for a few moments before the next trick occurs and you try to figure out that one as well.""Now You See Me"" is gonna be a sneak hit in my opinion. As time goes by, this movie will have life. In fact, as word of mouth gets out, this movie will have a steady pace of success before it gets swallowed up by the Summer movie tidal wave. Don't be mistaken though, if you like movies that are intelligent and challenging, ""Now You See Me"" is your kind of movie. With a great cast of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Michael Caine, this movie is gifted with great actors, working from an intelligent script that will keep you guessing. Despite all that, it will most likely slip through the cracks of all the mindless Summer movies that are on the way, so go see it before it disappears.",4,A TRICK INSIDE A TRICK INSIDE A TRICK,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,2571,"['inevitable', 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'something', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'expected', 'see', 'movie', 'magicians', 'obviously', 'have', 'bunch', 'dazzling', 'tricks', 'were', ""n't"", 'humanly', 'possibly', 'would', 'go', 'unexplained', 'were', 'possessed', 'other-worldly', 'entity', 'scene', 'trailer', 'where', 'four-horsemen', 'magician', 'team', 'stage', 'name', 'leap', 'building', 'magically', 'turn', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'floating', 'dollars', 'So', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'editor', 'magic', 'work', 'particular', 'shot', 'was', 'wrong', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'introducing', 'four', 'different', 'magicians', 'two', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'one', 'way', 'one', 'skills', 'common', 'street', 'thief', 'Together', 'are', 'brought', 'locked', 'room', 'dingy', 'hotel', 'mysterious', 'benefactor', 'coaxed', 'become', 'team', 'order', 'achieve', 'certain', 'goal', 'goal', 'mystery', 'most', 'movie', 'movie', 'then', 'just', 'year', 'later', 'four', 'magicians', 'have', 'become', 'Four-horsemen', 'daring', 'magician', 'team', 'quickly', 'talk', 'world', 'just', 'first', 'show.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'go', 'more', 'details', 'movie', 'fun', 'Just', 'magic', 'trick', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'want', 'see', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'truly', 'liked', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'movie', 'magic', 'trick', ""n't"", 'rely', 'unexplained', 'special', 'effects', 'fact', 'explain', 'nearly', 'single', 'trick', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'quality', 'movie', 'even', 'are', 'telling', 'how', 'tricks', 'are', 'done', 'are', 'only', 'enlightened', 'few', 'moments', 'next', 'trick', 'occurs', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'sneak', 'hit', 'opinion', 'time', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'life', 'fact', 'word', 'mouth', 'out', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'steady', 'pace', 'success', 'swallowed', 'up', 'Summer', 'movie', 'tidal', 'wave', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'mistaken', 'like', 'movies', 'are', 'intelligent', 'challenging', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'kind', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'movie', 'gifted', 'great', 'actors', 'working', 'intelligent', 'script', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'slip', 'cracks', 'mindless', 'Summer', 'movies', 'are', 'way', 'so', 'go', 'see']",N/A

I also really like Mark Rufalo.  His roles inMarvel's The Avengers, andJust Like Heavenproved how great of an actor he can be.  I even like Isla Fisher and Woody Harrelson! And, needless to say, I adore Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, two of the greatest actors of their generation.All this adoration led up to my excitement for Now You See Me.  Then I saw that the director was Louis Leterrier, which gave me pause.  Letierrer rarely rises above the material he's given (Clash of the Titans (2010),The Transportermovies).  In fact, the only movie I've ever really liked of his was The Incredible Hulk, which I think the only thing he added was excellent action scenes.  So, I went into this movie cautiously optimistic with lower than normal expectations.THE BADAlthough the characters are likable enough, there is a famine of character development in this film.  Almost every character is remarkably shallow.  I found myself wanting to see the mystery resolved, but not out of any attachment to the characters.  This was so surprising to me because of the immense amount of talent involved.  It felt like the screenwriters were bent on creating a mystery film with lots of twists and turns, but most of these don't involve much emotional resolution.I didn't find much satisfaction in the big twist at the end.  It felt contrived and made the investment that I had made (i.e. Over an hour of my time) seem almost not worth while.In attempting to create some tension in the first Vegas show (at least I think that was their intention) they circled the stage multiple times.  Although it was a cool effect, it made me a bit dizzy, which was NOT the desired effect, methinks.THE GOODNo one ever said that Mr. Leterrier doesn't know how to pace a film. And it shows: the pacing of the film is fantastic. There is never a dull moment, and the action plays out nicely.Woody Harrelson is his best in this movie. I really liked his character and wanted to see more of him.The pull of the this movie is the magic tricks: both watching them being performed, and having Morgan Freeman's character deduct how the illusions are actually done.  This, the actions scenes, and the banter between the four magicians are what make this movie worth seeing.CONCLUSIONThis movie is ultimately a popcorn flick: an action packed thriller that will both make you think and not think at the same time. It is a fun watch without much character development.  3.5/5 Stars.PARENTS GUIDEIt's rated PG-13 for an almost sex scene, sexual references, and some really intense action scenes.

1647644,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B00CIXVAN8,Davewise,"[0, 0]","Here is a clever combination of a heist movie with magic. As you would then expect, it is quite slick in its presentation and many of its characters. There are four magicians who meet and combine forces as &#34;The Four Horseman&#34; to enact four great magic acts. If that sounds a bit fantastic, it's because there is slight fantasy element here - the four individuals get together hoping to become part of the &#34;eye&#34;, a group of master magicians who protect magic. The special effects for the magic scenes are sometimes over the top (one of the floats in a bubble) but I enjoyed them. If fantasy isn't your thing though, don't worry because it's not a large part of the movie so you may still enjoy it.Besides the magic side of things, there are some good chase scenes and hand-to-hand fighting. The FBI and others pursue the magicians across a few different cities since they are stealing money; however, they don't keep the money so they are very much like Robin Hood. As you would expect/hope after looking over the cast list, the acting is quite good. My favorite was Jesse Eisenberg's magician character, though he seemed a LOT like the way he played Mark Zuckerberg in &#34;The Social Network&#34;. All of the characters are well fleshed out.

1647647,A2W7LKMON1FST0,B00CIXVAN8,David Doria,"[1, 4]","(SPOILERS)This movie is a religious-fest disguised as a psychological thriller.  As far as I can tell, the only reason it has gotten rave reviews is because of how much it bashes non-believers and masturbates the egos of believers.  The entire movie - amid horrible dialogue and plot holes - is spent hammering in the idea that magic is important and that it's OK to lie to people about it, as long as the lie makes them feel good.By the end of the movie, Morgan Freeman winds up in prison, framed by the movie's heroes (the magicians) for the crimes that they committed.  I am not exaggerating when I say that Morgan Freeman does nothing illegal or even unethical for the entire movie.  He shows the public how the main characters' magic acts are done, so people know that it is not real magic; for that alone, we are apparently expected to sympathize with his being framed.  After all...how dare someone replace hope and awe with truth.  Truth has no value, and is apparently an evil in this movie.As far as plot holes, they are &#34;filled up&#34; with such unbelievably mashed together junk, that I laughed out loud more than once.  For example, we see a main magician die in a car accident.  He clearly flips in his car, and the car explodes.  Of course, by this point in the movie, I know he couldn't possibly be dead, so it's not even surprising when you find out that he isn't...but I never would have guessed how stupidly this would be explained.  The movie takes us back in time to show how another magician (who somehow knew that the car chase would be at a specific part of a bridge during a specific time in the chase) happens to be driving a city bus, which apparently nobody noticed drove to the bridge equipped with a vehicle on the front exactly like the one the other magician is driving.  So we're supposed to believe that the vehicles were switched, and the one on the bus is the one that really crashed.  But what about the body?  The movie then takes us even further back in time, to show that a cadaver was stolen from a mortuary for this feat.By the end of the movie, the main magicians have committed grand larceny, hijacked a city bus, and stolen and destroyed the cadaver of some random family.  Yet we are STILL expected to cheer for them and jeer at Morgan Freeman, because the magicians did all of this to give some people hope, and Freeman let everyone know what a sham they were.",1,"If you think that keeping people honest should land you a hefty prison sentence, you'll love this movie",1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,2411,"['SPOILERS', 'movie', 'religious-fest', 'disguised', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'only', 'reason', 'gotten', 'rave', 'reviews', 'how', 'much', 'non-believers', 'egos', 'believers', 'entire', 'movie', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'holes', 'spent', 'hammering', 'idea', 'magic', 'important', 'OK', 'lie', 'people', 'as', 'long', 'lie', 'feel', 'end', 'movie', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'up', 'prison', 'framed', 'movie', 'heroes', 'magicians', 'crimes', 'committed', 'am', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'when', 'say', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'nothing', 'illegal', 'even', 'unethical', 'entire', 'movie', 'public', 'how', 'main', 'characters', 'magic', 'acts', 'are', 'done', 'people', 'know', 'not', 'real', 'magic', 'alone', 'are', 'apparently', 'expected', 'sympathize', 'being', 'framed', 'how', 'dare', 'someone', 'replace', 'hope', 'awe', 'truth', 'Truth', 'value', 'apparently', 'evil', 'movie.As', 'far', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', '34', 'filled', 'up', '34', 'such', 'unbelievably', 'mashed', 'together', 'junk', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'once', 'example', 'see', 'main', 'magician', 'die', 'car', 'accident', 'clearly', 'car', 'car', 'explodes', 'course', 'point', 'movie', 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'dead', 'not', 'even', 'surprising', 'when', 'find', 'out', ""n't"", 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'how', 'stupidly', 'would', 'be', 'explained', 'movie', 'back', 'time', 'show', 'how', 'magician', 'who', 'somehow', 'knew', 'car', 'chase', 'would', 'be', 'specific', 'part', 'bridge', 'specific', 'time', 'chase', 'be', 'driving', 'city', 'bus', 'apparently', 'nobody', 'noticed', 'drove', 'bridge', 'equipped', 'vehicle', 'front', 'exactly', 'one', 'other', 'magician', 'driving', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'vehicles', 'were', 'switched', 'one', 'bus', 'one', 'really', 'crashed', 'what', 'body', 'movie', 'then', 'even', 'further', 'back', 'time', 'show', 'cadaver', 'was', 'stolen', 'mortuary', 'end', 'movie', 'main', 'magicians', 'have', 'committed', 'grand', 'larceny', 'hijacked', 'city', 'bus', 'stolen', 'destroyed', 'cadaver', 'random', 'family', 'are', 'STILL', 'expected', 'cheer', 'jeer', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'magicians', 'did', 'give', 'people', 'hope', 'Freeman', 'let', 'everyone', 'know', 'what', 'sham', 'were']",N/A

It takes a year to hone and develop everything to be able to pull off the scheme they have been invited to participate in.

But when four magicians--aided by a mysterious and anonymous third party--come together to rob a French bank, the FBI comes calling, and the charms and outright fun of NOW YOU SEE ME come to the forefront.  Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher (wolf howl), and Dave Franco play the magicians; naming themselves the Four Horsemen, they rob the French bank doing a show in Las Vegas, steal all the money in their greedy benefactor's (Michael Caine) bank account in New Orleans (distributing over $140 million to the audience), and pull off the climatic show in New York by stealing a safe from a corrupt manufacturer containing half a billion dollars.  All the while a debunker of magic shows (Morgan Freeman) continues to warn the FBI Agent in charge of the investigation (Mark Ruffalo) and his Interpol counterpart (Melanie Laurent) that law enforcement is being set up for the ultimate comeuppance.  Yet there is a surprising (and very satisfying) plot twist showing ultimately who gets played the fool.  Accordingly the four magicians join the Eye, the metaphysical level for elite practitioners where magic really is magic.This is one fun romp.  The pacing and plot and acting are all fast and furious, as the Four Horsemen are always one step ahead of their pursuers.  And it's a good thing NOW YOU SEE ME gets out of the gate and moves; if it slowed down where the viewer can actually think about the plot and how the ""magic"" is performed, the movie would unravel in a heartbeat.

I just love Woody Harrelson's character for that reason.  He's the sarcastic soundtrack accompaniment to a lot of the hijinks that occur.

The group then proceed to conduct magic shows in which totally impossible feats (like robbing a bank and having all the money drop from the ceiling into the audience)are done flawlessly.  The FBI is called in to figure the whole mess out.  Mark Ruffalo plays the ever pragmatic seasoned FBI agent who is determined to find out the truth and stop the Horsemen.  The problem is that in order to arrest the magicians, the FBI would have to admit to believing that magic is real and that's not an option.  The Horsemen go on to perform more shows at different locations around the country and their actions lead to lots of action sequences, even a high speed car chase.

1647714,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00CIXVAN8,FNDNreview,"[11, 20]","When you're watching a movie trailer (in a theater or online), it's not hard to be misled - sort of like a magic trick.  In any event, there's been a big discussion in online communities about the amount of information a film's movie trailer gives away.  Are they giving away too much?  Does it take away from the overall quality of the film when the audience is already prepared to not laugh at a scene from a trailer, even though that particular scene helped put people in the theater to begin with?  In the event movie trailers were reduced to about a minute, is that too little information for people these days?  This all brings us to the incredibly flashy movie trailer released for the magic/bank heist film, Now You See Me.  To say this film's trailer gives away a fair amount of plot details is an understatement, since there's very little more to gain when you can already guess what happens.  Sure, there are relatively miniscule nuances that are missing from the trailer, but the main substance of the plot is right here in front of you, without even having to pay a dime to see it.  So, is it worth paying to see a film when the trailer basically gives away everything before you even see it?  Let's discuss that notion in the review for Now You See Me.Directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk), Now You See Me stars Mark Ruffalo as an FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes, who trails a group of magicians as they mysteriously rob banks while performing their act on stage.  These handpicked magicians include J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt Osbourne (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco).  On their own, they are mediocre, but they are each specially selected by a secret benefactor to form a group, known as the Four Horsemen.  In attendance for the horseman's magic shows is a magician myth buster, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), who makes an agreement with the horseman's original promoter, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), to destroy their act after they steal his millions and give it to an attending audience.  The FBI, Interpol, a myth buster, and an angry business man are all out to catch the illusive horseman.  Can anyone catch them before they complete their grand finale?  M&eacute;lanie Laurent, Common, and Michael J. Kelly also star in supporting roles.The general theme of this film is constantly repeated through the course of this film, which is ""the more you think you see, the easier it is to fool you.""  If you're standing in an auditorium watching a magic act, it's pretty impressive - not because it's supposedly magic, but because everyone wants to know how the performer did the tricks.  When you're watching a film, it's easy to trick an audience since the majority of the trickery is done through CGI.  That's not impressive, that's deceitful.  What's even more deceitful is passing off Now You See Me as an interesting movie in its advertisements, only to get people to the theater to show them the same advertisements they've already seen - only over a two hour span.  At this point, if you've seen the trailer to this film, you'd really only be paying to see how it ends.  So, is it worth the price of admission to see how this film ends?The answer to that particular question is not as simple as a quick ""yes"" or ""no.""  This film carries a large amount of star power that easily carries the load in a variety of scenes.  Basically, every second you'd be watching this film, you'd see a major actor/actress on the screen.  Does that translate to movie success?  More often than not, an A-list name isn't enough to garner a film recommendation - not anymore at least.  Let's go down the list:  Jesse Eisenberg plays his usual self-absorbed character that quickly grows tiresome, Woody Harrelson's character is purely charismatic and absolutely full of himself, Isla Fisher role is that of a dimwitted former assistant, serving no other purpose than to add a woman to the horseman, and Dave Franco plays aloof workhorse that is somehow able to fight like Jackie Chan.  And, there's really no need to say anything about Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman, since they have enough credentials to do whatever they want on screen (all of which happens to be awesome).If you want to talk about future star power, then keep your eye on Mark Ruffalo.  He's been around for quite a while, but he's really gone ""big"" since earning himself the role as Bruce Banner in Marvel's The Avengers.  Like his incredibly enjoyable performance in Zodiac, Ruffalo is once again a man of the law - a role that suits him quite well.  Now You See Me gives Ruffalo a ton of screen time, which was rather surprising considering the amount of talent in this film.  Surprisingly, the ""magicians"" aren't on stage very long, with the majority of the film belonging to Ruffalo and his endless pursuit of the horsemen.  He is unequivocally the shining star of this muddled dud.Overall, Now You See Me is exactly what you see - comparable to a cheesy reality TV show with very little substance and poor execution.  This film is just one of many knockoffs that can join Ocean's 11 in the ""too dumb to be believable"" category of silly bank robbery films that would never, ever work.  No matter how many flashing lights they use, or how many people they pack on the top of a roof building to cheer for them - these characters lack depth and intrigue.  Now You See Me features another ""big twist"" ending (if you even want to call it that), but by the time the twist takes place, you'll already be asking your movie neighbor ""what the heck is going on with this movie?""  The glitz and glamor are possibly enough to draw people to see this film, but don't give in to the light.  Make a smart decision and just move on to something else...Grade:  D+FNDNreview.com",2,'Now You See Me' conjures up a dud,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,5829,"['When', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie',

It is simply fantastic entertainment that keeps the viewer glue to the screen trying to figure out the impossible things that are happening to a superlative groups of actors playing well written roles (written by  Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt) and directed with aplomb by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk, Transporter 2, Unleashed, and the soon to be made Now You See Me 2!) whose imagery and imagination is endless.The story is simple but inordinately complex in the way it is shared. Four magicians each answer a mysterious summons to an obscure address with secrets inside. A year later, they are the Four Horseman (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco), big time stage illusionists who climax their sold out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts agents Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) of the FBI and Alma Vargas (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) of Interpol on the case to find out how they did it. However, this mystery proves difficult to solve even with the insights of the professional illusion exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). What follows is a bizarre investigation where nothing is what it seems with illusions, dark secrets and hidden agendas galore as all involved are reminded of a great truth in this puzzle: the closer you look, the less you see. Add to this rather amazing cast the talents of Michael Caine, Michael Kelly, Common, David Warshofsky, Jos&eacute; Garcia, and Elias Koteas  and the talents of Brian Tyler, musical score and the cinematography by  Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong and this film becomes addictive.

Despite what the trailer & opening scenes imply, this wasn't really a thinking-person's movie; fun to watch, entertaining but not engaging.  I won't give away anything but a fairly alert / intelligent teen could quickly narrow down the list of suspects to find the one pulling the strings behind the elaborate tricks; after all, the viewer is constantly warned about falling for misdirection and distractions. Once you subtract out all the distractions in the movie, the remainder leaves you with few choices as to who could be orchestrating the whole thing.Never the less, the ""tricks"" (bank heist, draining the millionaire's bank account) were just a tad too over-the-top to be taken seriously, but some of the standard stage illusions were satisfying to watch. The film starts out well enough but gets less-believable as it moves along.  The number one rule of magic: the simpler the trick, the better. Technically complicated illusions have too many things that can go wrong -- like obtaining the password to a millionaire's bank account.  It apparently never occurred to the writers that your average millionaire actually holds relatively little in liquid assets and what cash he or she keeps on hand is most likely maintained in multiple accounts; accounts utilizing multiple-layers of security including complex passwords with non-alphanumeric characters. Sheesh, anyone who does on-line banking knows that!And that's why I rated this 3-stars. The film was promoted as being somewhat cerebral in nature but, in the end, it really wasn't.

1647758,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B00CIXVAN8,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[2, 3]","Now You See Me is about as close to a magic trick as a film can become - it's glitzy, slick, fast, fantastical and ultimately nonsense. Unlike the vast majority of 2013's theater offerings, it's undoubtedly exciting and entertaining and keeps a pace going that stops the audience asking really obvious questions. But unlike other recent magic-themed films such as The Illusionist and Prestige, both of which have tricks of their own and get better with each viewing, Now You See Me gets flimsier and less substantial the more you think about the plot, and feels more like a pick-pocketing scam than a grand heist.The opening quickly establishes four supposedly world-class magicians, none of which seems to have any really great acts, and they are assembled by a mysterious hooded character who gives them all coded tarot cards to meet. Naturally, they all do and are led to an apartment where a grand scheme is unveiled in 3D holographic schematics that a NASA engineer wouldn't be able to understand. Somehow they figure it out and united as the Four Horsemen, the crew now put on Robin Hood-style shows where the wealthy are robbed and the poor are literally showered with cash. Sounds like fun, right?Unfortunately, the logic gets so bad so quickly it becomes ridiculous. After a French bank is robbed by magic, an Interpol agent is sent to Vegas to work with the FBI (good luck getting the paperwork to approve that partnership). The FBI proves to be staggeringly incompetent as our magicians show a near-psychic capability to outwit them at every turn. At one point, our heroes even hijack a bus rigged with a flipping and exploding squad car to fake a disappearance, all set up within minutes at exactly the right point on a bridge. They even install a massive, smear-free, 5-ton mirror to hide a safe instead of simply stealing it, hoping that the police stand only at exactly the right angle to see it's gone (and praying they don't dust for prints and bang their heads on the mirror).This is all part of the fun but by the time act three rolls around, the film doesn't even pretend to be about illusion and mind-games anymore - it quickly descends into impossible CG shots and absurd set pieces that are fun but betray the original premise completely. The big reveal for one of the major characters is completely unbelievable, worsened by a really weak romance plot that's wedged into the storyline. The actual finale is such an insult to the audience that I couldn't believe it made the final cut.Still, the remarkable thing is that it's an enjoyable film that, just like a well-executed illusion, keeps you watching and guessing if ultimately it's a bit disappointing. None of the characters really develops, nothing of any substance really happens, and none of the heist twist stand up to any scrutiny, but in a year full of truly atrocious movies, it's relatively decent.",4,Fast and fun - but don't expect The Prestige,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,2885,"['Now', 'See', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'magic', 'trick', 'film', 'can', 'become', 'glitzy', 'slick', 'fast', 'fantastical', 'ultimately', 'nonsense', 'vast', 'majority', '2013', 'theater', 'offerings', 'undoubtedly', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'pace', 'going', 'audience', 'asking', 'really', 'obvious', 'questions', 'other', 'recent', 'magic-themed', 'films', 'such', 'Illusionist', 'Prestige', 'have', 'tricks', 'own', 'get', 'better', 'viewing', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'flimsier', 'less', 'substantial', 'more', 'think', 'plot', 'feels', 'more', 'pick-pocketing', 'scam', 'grand', 'heist.The', 'opening', 'quickly', 'four', 'supposedly', 'world-class', 'magicians', 'none', 'have', 'really', 'great', 'acts', 'are', 'assembled', 'mysterious', 'hooded', 'character', 'who', 'coded', 'tarot', 'cards', 'meet', 'Naturally', 'do', 'are', 'led', 'apartment', 'where', 'grand', 'scheme', 'unveiled', '3D', 'holographic', 'schematics', 'NASA', 'engineer', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'Somehow', 'figure', 'out', 'united', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'crew', 'now', 'put', 'Robin', 'Hood-style', 'where', 'wealthy', 'are', 'robbed', 'poor', 'are', 'literally', 'showered', 'cash', 'fun', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'logic', 'so', 'bad', 'so', 'quickly', 'ridiculous', 'French', 'bank', 'robbed', 'magic', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'sent', 'Vegas', 'work', 'FBI', 'good', 'luck', 'getting', 'paperwork', 'approve', 'partnership', 'FBI', 'be', 'staggeringly', 'incompetent', 'magicians', 'show', 'near-psychic', 'capability', 'outwit', 'turn', 'one', 'point', 'heroes', 'even', 'hijack', 'bus', 'rigged', 'flipping', 'exploding', 'squad', 'car', 'fake', 'disappearance', 'set', 'up', 'minutes', 'exactly', 'right', 'point', 'bridge', 'even', 'install', 'massive', 'smear-free', '5-ton', 'mirror', 'hide', 'safe', 'instead', 'simply', 'stealing', 'hoping', 'police', 'stand', 'only', 'exactly', 'right', 'angle', 'see', 'gone', 'praying', 'do', ""n't"", 'dust', 'prints', 'bang', 'heads', 'mirror', '.This', 'part', 'fun', 'time', 'act', 'three', 'rolls', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'pretend', 'be', 'illusion', 'mind-games', 'anymore', 'quickly', 'impossible', 'CG', 'shots', 'absurd', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'fun', 'original', 'premise', 'completely', 'big', 'reveal', 'one', 'major', 'characters', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'worsened', 'really', 'weak', 'romance', 'plot', 'wedged', 'storyline', 'actual', 'finale', 'such', 'insult', 'audience', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'made', 'final', 'cut.Still', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'just', 'well-executed', 'illusion', 'watching', 'guessing', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'None', 'characters', 'really', 'nothing', 'substance', 'really', 'none', 'heist', 'twist', 'stand', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'year', 'full', 'truly', 'atrocious', 'movies', 'relatively', 'decent']",N/A

It straddled both, and didn't stretch my imagination to accomplish that.But, like I said, someone I know said it kept her guessing all the way through and saying &#34;WHAT!?&#34; at the end.I loved Ruffalo in The Avengers ... he makes a great Hulk.  I liked seeing him in something else - let's me know even more how much I liked him in The Avengers, though I didn't dislike him in this. Maybe it's the genre.  Morgan Freeman - always good (or haven't seen him in a bad role).  However, somewhat predicable was his role.  In so many ways, much was boringly predictable.  One guy talked way too fast.  And, some of it was simply unbelievable (like when the transporter functioned).  The trickery behind it and the explanation about magic not being magic just slight of hand - was good.  The finale?

Everyone who has not yet seen this movie should definitely watch it. Here are my thoughts.What we have are a team of magicians and a agent determined to bring them down. This powerhouse cast consists of: Mark Ruffalo as Dylan the FBI agent, Michael Caine as Arthur Tressler, Dave Franco as Jack Wilder, Isla Fisher portraying Henley, Woody Harrelson as Merritt Mckinney, Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, Melanie Laurent as Alma Dray, Jesse Eisenberg as Daniel, and rapper/rising actor Common makes minor appearances as Agent Evans. The whole cast was great; I was really impressed with Mark Ruffalo's performance and Jesse Eisenberg is quite the catch.The story in this movie is not as simple as some would think it is. Sure, it DOES involve magic, illusion, and the art of deception, but expect some major surprises (especially towards the 3rd act) and many questions left that will hopefully be answered in the sequel.I would honestly give Now You See Me a solid perfect score, although I do wish that a few things had been handled better.

1647837,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00CIXVAN8,J. Richardson,"[2, 5]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.As the credits started rolling at the end of Now You See Me there was one feeling that overwhelmed all others, the feeling of being misled. The promotional trailers all lead you to believe that the film is going to be about one thing, but in reality it's about something else entirely. I don't know why, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth. The more I thought about it the more I felt like Now You See Me just didn't live up to its full potential.That's not to say that it's a bad movie, though. On the contrary, Now You See Me manages to keep you entertained for majority of its lengthy two hour running time. What got to me, though, was that you see very little of what I thought were the four leads: J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henly Reeves (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco). Instead, a lot of focus is put on Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and Alma Vargas (Melanie Laurent).That's where I think they kind of lost me. I think Louis Leterrier wanted to take this movie in a different direction than what most people are expecting and it's going to have a lot of people leaving disappointed. Instead of focusing on these four magicians and the repercussions of robbing a bank, they tried to create some convoluted plot that revolves around who got these four together and why (s)he is asking them to do these things in the first place. Which is fine, but don't advertise the movie as one thing only to have a completely different set-up.Still, I must admit that even with the somewhat lackluster plot I was impressed by how well they covered every little detail. Usually movies like this leave some major plot-holes or a group of unanswered questions, but every question in Now You See Me gets answered by the end of the movie. Which was nice because as the movie was progressing I said to myself, ""So we're just going to forget that this happened? We're not going to discuss this any further?"", but, thankfully, everything got covered eventually. This also allowed the audience to feel like every little detail in the plot was important because, in the grand scheme of things, they were.What annoyed me the most, however, was the inclusion of an extremely out-of-place romantic side story between Rhodes and Vargas. Some movies call for these things while others, like this one, don't. The relationship is just completely unnecessary and it does nothing substantial to help progress the plot. Vargas' involvement in the story as a whole was slightly significant, but the little romantic tension just felt tacky and forced. Note to any aspiring film directors/writers: Not every film needs romance! In fact, some films will wind up better without any romance at all, Now You See Me being a prime example of this.Perhaps this film's strongest attribute is its cast. You have an all-star lineup consisting of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, and Woody Harrelson. Four fantastic actors who deliver once again by giving the audience an engaging and fun performance. Then you have Michael Cain with a pretty minor role and Dave Franco with what's probably his first really big role. Out of everyone involved Franco in particular stood out the most to me. I've grown to love Eisenberg over the years, Harrelson is always a blast, and you can never go wrong with Freeman, but Franco just knocked it out of the park in this movie. Still, I wish that he, along with the other three magicians, received more screen time. The four of them had fantastic chemistry that was never really utilized.Finally, the film's score, composed by Brian Tyler, leaves a lot to be desired. In terms of the film itself it does its job, but as a standalone score it does nothing new or inventive. In fact, almost every piece I heard in this movie felt like a rip-off of some other big budget action film. There was no originality, no creativity, and, most importantly, it just lacked its own identity. Probably one of the weakest and most generic film scores I've heard in quite some time.Overall Score: 7/10 - I think my main issue with this film is that I felt duped. The magic was nice and it was cool to see them break it down and show you just how ""real"" magic is, but beyond that the experience as a whole just felt underwhelming.

This movie was an epic fail for me on so many levels, for starters, it was waaay longer than it had to be. The idea and the premise was actually good, and I loved the actors in this movie, and their illusions were visually stunning. However, I agree that some of these stunts were just unrealistic and unbelievable. Even the best magicians in the world couldn't pull of what they pulled off. On top of that, the ending dropped the ball for me. I guess I couldn't see what the hell they were doing? I get that it wasn't about they money, but there had to be something more than what we saw. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie yet, but that ending.

Just one big superhero flick after the other, and it's just rather boring and mundane after the fourth or fifth one. ""Now You See Me"" reminded me of the little spark of magic though that is possible with a really well done movie. Though I had more or less figured out the end by the time I got there, I left the theater with a big ol smile on my face. ""Now You See Me"" is slick, sophisticated and very fun (as long as you don't think too deeply about it).Four magicians are placed together and given a set of tasks/shows that they must perform in order to gain entrance into a secret magician's society (a bit like Yale's Skull and Bones Society). When their first show leads to a bank being robbed, the FBI get involved and rush to figure out how this team is pulling off their tricks. Morgan Freeman plays an ex-magician intent on unmasking the ""magic"" and revealing the secrets behind what the band of four are doing which also heightens the drama. His character serves as almost a narrator to the tricks, which the viewer needs as some of the tricks enter the realm of being wholly unbelievable and wouldn't be able to be figured out at all by just watching the movie. And the last piece of the puzzle comes from a reoccurring story of a legendary magician who tragically died. By the end of the movie, everything comes together and the end serves up a one-two punch plot twist that elevates it from being just eye candy to being memorable.What was surprising to me was that with the exception of Woody Harrelson, I didn't particularly like any of the characters. Normally this is one of my biggest turnoffs with movies--but I didn't really care here as the entire emphasis is on the stunts, performances and plot. The characters in this movie simply exist to move the plot forward, and quite honestly it doesn't matter that they are rather one dimensional. This movie is all about the spectacle. The show. The misdirection. And it certainly succeeds in this regard. It means there isn't much depth to it, but the ride sure is engrossing.Recommended for those who enjoyed ""Ocean's 11"", ""The Prestige"", ""The Illusionist"" and anyone looking to indulge your inner kid.

And putting four insufferable showboating know-it-alls on the same stage? Unbearable.Thought the premise interesting and the story clever, but how can anyone too low on the hipster list of mocking snarks ever hope to squeeze themselves into the same space occupied by a quad of ever-expanding craniums? Even done on a fictional cinematic stage - it's extraordinarily difficult to appreciate the movie being presented.From my perspective these are people whom I know as the Insecure Knowledge Whore. Someone who constantly *has* to have a ""greater insight"" than you or anybody within distance of their voice. Feeding off your discomfort, they're in-the-know and you, you poor low-brow slob, have no clue what's really at play.And we're not just talking just magic - one will find these mental cases across every aspect of Life. Sadly, more so today than in years past. Interestingly, that kind of warped personality is also shared by conspiracy nutters.People like this can't function without attempting to belittle you by way of condescension.And, basically, these four identical polished prima donna turds were popped from the same unpleasant mold.Despite the film's premise that they are the Robin Hoods of Magic, adjusting the balance of society's scale; one has to remember that they weren't doing this out of some selfless sense of justice or community, but a self-interest in joining a secret club. In fact, judged outside of their ""act"", these characters have little, if any, redeeming merit.I hunkered down and pushed thru the entire two-hours just to see ""the reveal"".In this modern 21st Century where self-aggrandizement and unapologetic narcissism are the norm - this might be enjoyable for those who enjoy mirrors and where selfies are a common, if not daily, occurrence.Sadly, the film's concept is lost under the massive weight of collected ego that these black holes draw to themselves.If this wasn't such a tight, well made production, I would happily dump this into the two-star category.

But the kinds of illusions you see from the likes of Copperfield, Angel, and Penn & Teller have pretty obvious parameters. Here's a bullet with your initials fired from a gun and caught in the teeth of someone across the stage. Watch as these nails and swords pierce my flesh with no seeming damage. Solid Lucite box? I'll float in it. Ta da.Movie magic requires a whole lot more to both earn and reward that suspension of disbelief. It takes interesting and believable characters. It takes entertaining and engaging storytelling. It takes a movie world that plays by some understandable and consistent ground rules. Without that, all you've got is spectacle. A lot of hocus with none of the follow-up pocus. If that makes any sense.NOW YOU SEE ME is a story about four B-list magicians who are invited via mysterious cards to be a part of some kind of be-all, end-all magic trick. It might have something to do with a magician named Shrike who died during a botched trick long ago. It might have something to do with robbing millions of dollars in cash. It might even have something to do with a group called The Eye that is the supposed guardian of real, live, actual magic!It's really not very clear. Ever. Like a magician with too much patter, the movie keeps trying to explain itself but is still so desperate to keep some of that magic that it's explanations only go halfway. Most of them come from Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a man who has dedicated his life to debunking magicians. He keeps detailing how tricks are done, but he never really does fill in all the blanks. He can tell you how four magicians robbed a bank in Paris while standing on a stage in America, but he conveniently leaves out the part where they burst into wads of cash while jumping off a twenty story roof. The last third of the movie is glutted with this kind of heavy and inconsistent exposition, and it makes the film feel like it's not entirely comfortable with its subject matter.Because there's so much going on, there is really very little time to get to know or even care about any of the characters. Our four magicians end up feeling more like props or set pieces, and in spite of their glitzy bravado and showmanship, they are about as hollow and fake as a mirrored box. The movie's emotional hook lies in Dylan (Mark Ruffalo), the FBI agent who is hell-bent on hunting them down. Unfortunately, he ends up being a one-note character as well, and the story takes him into a place that is supposed to be magical, but that ends up feeling like a really cheap trick, like the ""got your nose"" of the cinematic world.The movie, in spite of all of this, is a helluva a lot of fun to look at, and there are some satisfying moments here and there (including an amazingly choreographed fight scene/car chase). No actor really stood out, but then again, none of them were glaringly bad, either. However, unlike a magic show where they take great pains to roll up the sleeves and denounce camera or light trickery, this flick -- both the way it's filmed and told -- just feels like a lot of smoke and mirrors and not much else. You might be able to suspend your disbelief for the film, but like the old trick with the floating woman, you'll probably need the help of some wires and wenches to keep it up there for the entire movie.",3,Slight Of Hand,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,3403,"['Magic', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'one', 'big', 'factor', 'shares', 'movies', 'kinds', 'illusions', 'see', 'likes', 'Copperfield', 'Angel', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'have', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'parameters', 'Here', 'bullet', 'initials', 'fired', 'gun', 'caught', 'teeth', 'someone', 'stage', 'nails', 'swords', 'pierce', 'flesh', 'seeming', 'damage', 'Solid', 'Lucite', 'box', ""'ll"", 'float', 'Ta', 'da.Movie', 'magic', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'earn', 'reward', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'interesting', 'believable', 'characters', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'storytelling', 'movie', 'world', 'understandable', 'consistent', 'ground', 'rules', ""'ve"", 'got', 'spectacle', 'lot', 'hocus', 'none', 'follow-up', 'pocus', 'sense.NOW', 'YOU', 'SEE', 'ME', 'story', 'four', 'B-list', 'magicians', 'who', 'are', 'invited', 'mysterious', 'cards', 'be', 'part', 'kind', 'be-all', 'end-all', 'magic', 'trick', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'magician', 'named', 'Shrike', 'who', 'died', 'botched', 'trick', 'long', 'ago', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'robbing', 'millions', 'dollars', 'cash', 'might', 'even', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'group', 'called', 'Eye', 'supposed', 'guardian', 'real', 'live', 'actual', 'magic', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'Ever', 'magician', 'too', 'much', 'patter', 'movie', 'trying', 'explain', 'still', 'so', 'desperate', 'keep', 'magic', 'explanations', 'only', 'go', 'halfway', 'Most', 'come', 'Thaddeus', 'Bradley', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'man', 'who', 'dedicated', 'life', 'debunking', 'magicians', 'detailing', 'how', 'tricks', 'are', 'done', 'never', 'really', 'fill', 'blanks', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'four', 'magicians', 'robbed', 'bank', 'Paris', 'standing', 'stage', 'America', 'conveniently', 'out', 'part', 'where', 'burst', 'wads', 'cash', 'jumping', 'off', 'twenty', 'story', 'roof', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'glutted', 'kind', 'heavy', 'inconsistent', 'exposition', 'film', 'feel', 'not', 'entirely', 'comfortable', 'subject', 'matter.Because', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'even', 'care', 'characters', 'four', 'magicians', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'more', 'like', 'props', 'set', 'pieces', 'spite', 'glitzy', 'bravado', 'showmanship', 'are', 'hollow', 'fake', 'mirrored', 'box', 'movie', 'emotional', 'hook', 'Dylan', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'hell-bent', 'hunting', 'down', 'Unfortunately', 'up', 'being', 'one-note', 'character', 'well', 'story', 'place', 'supposed', 'be', 'magical', 'up', 'feeling', 'really', 'cheap', 'trick', 'got', 'nose', 'cinematic', 'world.The', 'movie', 'spite', 'helluva', 'lot', 'fun', 'look', 'are', 'satisfying', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'including', 'amazingly', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scene/car', 'chase', 'actor', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'then', 'again', 'none', 'were', 'glaringly', 'bad', 'either', 'However', 'magic', 'show', 'where', 'take', 'great', 'pains', 'roll', 'up', 'sleeves', 'denounce', 'camera', 'light', 'trickery', 'flick', 'way', 'filmed', 'told', 'just', 'feels', 'lot', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'film', 'old', 'trick', 'floating', 'woman', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'need', 'help', 'wires', 'wenches', 'keep', 'up', 'there', 'entire', 'movie']",N/A

While it's true that a couple of the tricks are somewhat spectacular, the viewer never really connects with the magicians.  There is a better connection with Mark Ruffalo's character and Morgan Freeman's character, but there too, the viewer never really gets to know either of them well enough.  The result is that watching the film feels like watching a performance instead of becoming absorbed with the story.  The relationship between Ruffalo's character and the Interpol character never really takes off either.  At the end of the movie, I was left wondering why they were even thrown together in the film.

If you like movies with no explanation of plots or details or if you do believe in magic and everything you see then you'll love this.If you prefer movies with plot building, character building, relating to the characters, substance and an ending that completes the movie, then do not watch this one. I love my 16yr old daughter but the good lord did not grace her with patience or common sense in the real world but she is trying. Having said that, she thought this was the best movie she had seen in her life. Absolutely no explanation on many plot twists, ---SPOILERS HERE...SPOILERS HERE.......The 5th Horseman we find at the end? He funded all that and was a full time police officer?  Who set up the elaborate show at the end? The lights, the props?Are we to believe they hypnotized dozens and dozens of people? I thought they were street magicians not professional stunt drivers to do what they did on that bridge?..come on people.And what actually happened-(the other 4 horseman)to them in the end? So there really is ""the eye"" ? This movie requires absolutely no thinking except to wonder why they would try to smooth over and explain so many unrealistic plot elements.

1647991,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B00CIXVAN8,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[3, 5]","Now You See Me pits an elite group of world renown magicians, The Four Horsemen, against a disgruntled FBI agent in an intense game of cat and mouse. With a serious vendetta against the illusionists, Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) teams up with Interpol agent, Alma Dray (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) to catch The Horsemen off their guard. The illusionists have been given an impossible mission---to pull off a series of daring heists, stealing from a bevy of corrupt business leaders. And they do, in front of an audience during their show. And like modern-day Robin Hoods, they generously shower the stolen profits upon the unsuspecting crowd, all while staying one step ahead of the law.I love movies that use real-life magic as a premise, movies like The Illusionist and The Prestige, so when I first saw the trailer for Now You See Me, I was really excited. Now You See Me had quickly become one of my most anticipated movies of the year. And much to my disappointment, it has also become one of the biggest letdowns of the year.This movie has an all-star cast (Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain & Dave Franco), intriguing premise and SO much potential. So where did it go wrong? Poor character development, a shoddy script and too much time focusing on befuddling the viewer, for starters. It very much reminded me of The Gangster Squad with it's lack of intellectual integrity and try-too-hard attitude.They turn Agent Rhodes (Ruffalo) into a total buffoon which makes the whole cat and mouse thing a bust. If you're going to use that angle, the opposing forces need to be equally matched, drawing out the suspense. Such was not the case here. And then you expect to see this group of talented actors shine, instead, it's like attempting to pull too many rabbits out of the hat. It's just a bunch of terrific actors who are totally restricted and undervalued. The draw of the film, The Horsemen, are given less screen time than expected and they're really the ones you want to see. Give me more Woody Harrelson!Now You See Me promises many things to the viewer but it never delivers upon those promises. It's not cerebrally challenging the way a magic movie should be. The twists and reversals weren't surprising and were completely unbelievable. You didn't see them coming, not because of skillful misdirection as was often implied, but rather because the explanations were crooked and expedient. Especially, near the end as we backtrack through the movie's big events, the reveals are less-than-convincing than if you were to simply believe in real magic. I'll take fantasy over the contrived solutions in this movie.Now You See Me, like most magic, is all smoke and mirrors with no real substance hiding behind the curtain. Basically, it's just one big pile of crap.Food for Thought: Now You See Me is a mix of Robin Hood meets The Prestige---only not quite so good. Sure, it's got all the misdirection that a magic movie should have, but much like bad magic, there's no integrity. Flashy, full of bells and whistles and big personalities, this movie has so much potential. Unfortunately, it completely fails in the execution, rendering it one of my biggest disappointments this year. If you want magic then you should watch The Prestige instead.",2,Now You See Me... and why I wish I hadn't.,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,3290,"['Now', 'See', 'Me', 'pits', 'elite', 'group', 'world', 'renown', 'magicians', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'disgruntled', 'FBI', 'agent', 'intense', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'serious', 'vendetta', 'illusionists', 'Dylan', 'Rhodes', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'up', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'Alma', 'Dray', 'M', 'eacute', 'Laurent', 'catch', 'Horsemen', 'off', 'guard', 'illusionists', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'impossible', 'mission', 'pull', 'off', 'series', 'daring', 'heists', 'stealing', 'bevy', 'corrupt', 'business', 'leaders', 'do', 'front', 'audience', 'show', 'modern-day', 'Robin', 'Hoods', 'generously', 'shower', 'stolen', 'profits', 'unsuspecting', 'crowd', 'staying', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'law.I', 'love', 'movies', 'use', 'real-life', 'magic', 'premise', 'movies', 'Illusionist', 'Prestige', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'Now', 'See', 'had', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'movies', 'year', 'much', 'disappointment', 'also', 'become', 'one', 'biggest', 'letdowns', 'year.This', 'movie', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Michael', 'Cain', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'SO', 'much', 'potential', 'where', 'did', 'go', 'wrong', 'Poor', 'character', 'development', 'shoddy', 'script', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'focusing', 'befuddling', 'viewer', 'starters', 'very', 'much', 'reminded', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'lack', 'intellectual', 'integrity', 'try-too-hard', 'attitude.They', 'turn', 'Agent', 'Rhodes', 'Ruffalo', 'total', 'buffoon', 'whole', 'cat', 'mouse', 'thing', 'bust', ""'re"", 'going', 'use', 'angle', 'opposing', 'forces', 'need', 'be', 'equally', 'matched', 'drawing', 'out', 'suspense', 'Such', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'then', 'expect', 'see', 'group', 'talented', 'actors', 'shine', 'instead', 'attempting', 'pull', 'too', 'many', 'rabbits', 'hat', 'just', 'bunch', 'terrific', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'totally', 'restricted', 'undervalued', 'draw', 'film', 'Horsemen', 'are', 'given', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'expected', ""'re"", 'really', 'ones', 'want', 'see', 'Give', 'more', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'promises', 'many', 'things', 'viewer', 'never', 'promises', 'not', 'cerebrally', 'challenging', 'way', 'magic', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'twists', 'reversals', 'were', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'were', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'not', 'skillful', 'misdirection', 'was', 'often', 'implied', 'rather', 'explanations', 'were', 'crooked', 'expedient', 'Especially', 'end', 'backtrack', 'movie', 'big', 'events', 'reveals', 'are', 'less-than-convincing', 'were', 'simply', 'believe', 'real', 'magic', ""'ll"", 'take', 'fantasy', 'contrived', 'solutions', 'movie.Now', 'See', 'Me', 'most', 'magic', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'real', 'substance', 'hiding', 'curtain', 'Basically', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'pile', 'crap.Food', 'Thought', 'Now', 'See', 'mix', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Prestige', '-only', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'good', 'Sure', 'got', 'misdirection', 'magic', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'much', 'bad', 'magic', 'integrity', 'Flashy', 'full', 'bells', 'whistles', 'big', 'personalities', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'Unfortunately', 'completely', 'execution', 'rendering', 'one', 'biggest', 'disappointments', 'year', 'want', 'magic', 'then', 'should', 'watch', 'Prestige', 'instead']",N/A

I will not be discussing anything not shown in the trailers, and I ask you not to go looking for such secrets online, but only by watching it yourself. This movie is designed to entertain, and to a degree it does just that.I haven't seen many of Leterrier's films, but I enjoyed this about as much as The Incredible Hulk, but more than Clash of the Titans. There were still disappointments. Magic movies have been a great interest of mine, and from the trailer I had to wonder, does Michael Caine + woman in a tank = The Prestige? Truthfully, the similarities stopped there, including magic's screentime.Despite magic taking up most of the trailers, it was too scarce in the film itself. I wanted more magic. I know that doing so would take screen time from Ruffalo, but he wasn't the best of the bunch. In fact, they were Freeman, Caine, and Laurent, respectively.The screenwriting didn't allow for many to develop character well. The Four Horsemen were usually smooth-talking brick walls. And was that Dave Franco I saw? He had no screentime! (except for brief fancy dodging falling fighting)These character holes would be acceptable if the movie were a large show. But as mentioned before, magic only came in smaller pieces, when at all. Some were amazing, some were old already, and some were hilarious.It seems like I didn't appreciate the movie much, but I could only talk about what I didn't like. The rest, the secrets, I loved but can't talk about. Suffice it to say that many surprises are in store, and they're worth watching the movie for. That said, it's best to go in without guessing and predicting, because seeing the many reveals is where most of the entertainment lies. Don't spoil it for yourself.This is a film some would be happier seeing in theatres, but if you don't think you'd spend ticket money for this, you'd probably regret it, so wait for dvd.As a warning, there is a suggestive/inappropriate scene near the beginning that ends up going nowhere, but children's eyes should be turned aside. Also, there's a moment in a mardi gras parade that needs to be avoided, and minor language throughout. I'd recommend this movie for 17+, not only for these, but for the understanding of the secret material I can't bring up.",4,"Magic and Character development were lacking, but surprises entertained",1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,2312,"['very', 'important', 'realize', 'movie', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'spoiled', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'discussing', 'anything', 'not', 'shown', 'trailers', 'ask', 'not', 'go', 'looking', 'such', 'secrets', 'online', 'only', 'watching', 'movie', 'designed', 'entertain', 'degree', 'just', 'that.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'Leterrier', 'films', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'more', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'were', 'still', 'disappointments', 'Magic', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'interest', 'mine', 'trailer', 'had', 'wonder', 'Michael', 'Caine', '+', 'woman', 'tank', 'Prestige', 'Truthfully', 'similarities', 'stopped', 'there', 'including', 'magic', 'screentime.Despite', 'magic', 'taking', 'up', 'most', 'trailers', 'was', 'too', 'scarce', 'film', 'wanted', 'more', 'magic', 'know', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'take', 'screen', 'time', 'Ruffalo', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'bunch', 'fact', 'were', 'Freeman', 'Caine', 'Laurent', 'respectively.The', 'screenwriting', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'many', 'develop', 'character', 'well', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'were', 'usually', 'smooth-talking', 'brick', 'walls', 'was', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'saw', 'had', 'screentime', 'brief', 'fancy', 'dodging', 'falling', 'fighting', 'character', 'holes', 'would', 'be', 'acceptable', 'movie', 'were', 'large', 'show', 'mentioned', 'magic', 'only', 'came', 'smaller', 'pieces', 'when', 'were', 'amazing', 'were', 'old', 'already', 'were', 'hilarious.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'movie', 'much', 'could', 'only', 'talk', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'rest', 'secrets', 'loved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'Suffice', 'say', 'many', 'surprises', 'are', 'store', ""'re"", 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'said', 'best', 'go', 'guessing', 'predicting', 'seeing', 'many', 'reveals', 'where', 'most', 'entertainment', 'Do', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'yourself.This', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'happier', 'seeing', 'theatres', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'spend', 'ticket', 'money', ""'d"", 'probably', 'regret', 'so', 'wait', 'dvd.As', 'warning', 'suggestive/inappropriate', 'scene', 'beginning', 'up', 'going', 'nowhere', 'children', 'eyes', 'should', 'be', 'turned', 'aside', 'Also', 'moment', 'mardi', 'gras', 'parade', 'be', 'avoided', 'minor', 'language', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', '17+', 'not', 'only', 'understanding', 'secret', 'material', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'up']",N/A

This is popcorn cinema at its finest - the kind of movie that entertains while not being overtly deep.  It's the kind of film Roland Emmerich used to make back in the heyday of 1990s blockbuster cinema.The movie starts with the supposed heist seen in the trailer.  As the story unfolds, Mark Ruffalo's character is trying to chase down the magicians and we are constantly trying to figure out how these feats were done, whose on whose side, and are appropriately kept on the edge of our seats while trying to do so.The film works because of the actors, a fun (but albeit highly implausible) screenplay, and some really tight pacing.  The over the top tricks allow for a good show and the choice of actors is great.  Jess Eisenberg and Woody Harleson are easily the most fun to watch in this.  Then there's the neat little twist in the end, which, admittedly, the film didn't need, but it works.I highly recommend this because it's so much fun to watch.  Just don't take it too seriously.  I miss a popcorn movie done well.  There are dozens of dumb, formulaic, repetitive popcorn films coming out nearly every week, but this one is different.

1648031,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00CIXVAN8,Ranny Levy,"[7, 9]","""Now You See Me"" tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation. Featuring Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKenny (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the Four Horsemen make a dream team of street magicians. Since they have made their stunts public, allowing the world to ""witness"" the robberies, authorities are in hot pursuit of the four, now wanted criminals. Detective Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is accompanied in his search for the illusive magicians by Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and French detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). Will the Four Horsemen be able to pull of their final act without being caught, or will it be curtains for the criminal performers? Our KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven D, raved about this film. See her review below.I absolutely love this film. ""Now You See Me"" is like nothing I've ever seen before. The plot is so original and full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. I love how fast paced this film is, I swear there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns it should be a pretzel, but it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and hits you with major shock factor. The acting in this film is incredible. It features a group of incredible actors - Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and many others. I love how each character has a unique quirk and personality that you can really see, but they all work together so well. The cinematography and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures, drawing you into the magic and making the illusions appear so real. The soundtrack is also amazing. It is suits each scene very well, while keeping a consistent theme and feel throughout the movie. ""Now You See Me"" is definitely not one to miss.It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the ""card trick"" or ""read your mind"" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the ""muscle"" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.My favorite scene is when the Four Horsemen have to escape from the FBI after their second robbery. Jack Wilder has to stay behind to burn secret files. When he has an unexpected run-in with Detective Rhodes, an action filled fight sequence and high speed chase follow. This scene is filled with suspense, action and incredible stunts and it shows that the Horsemen are always two steps ahead.I recommend this film for ages 12+ because of violence and mild mature language.

With a little misdirection, a little flair, and a lot of heart, 'Now You See Me' manages to be both.What I love most about magic is the capacity to delight. By giving in just a little to the possibility of something wonderful, a good magician can create something that enchants and mystifies, something we can talk about later and tell our friends, &#34;wasn't that amazing?&#34; I had the same feeling after leaving the theatre after seeing 'Now You See Me' - I wanted to share this experience with my friends, to tell them about what made it so special, to encourage them to see it for themselves.And the caper angle is right there too - four solo magicians, each with different talents, who come together to make an astonishing claim: in front of a packed Las Vegas audience, they're going to rob a bank. What follows is fun, exciting, mystifying, full of unexpected twists and turns, and packing a surprising emotional punch at the end. Carried by solid, believable performances from Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, and the always-delightful Morgan Freeman, and shot in a dynamic style that made me feel like I was front row center for every trick, 'Now You See Me' carried me willingly along for the ride from beginning to end.The Blu-ray edition of the movie follows a trend I like to see, including both the original theatrical cut and an Extended cut (adding about 10 minutes of footage in) on the blu-ray disc, and also including a separate DVD of just the theatrical version - giving us different viewing options depending on the equipment available. The blu-ray movie looks and sounds great, and the extra 10 minutes of movie in the extended cut aren't essential, but flesh out a couple scenes nicely.  All in all, a great package.The only movie I can think to compare 'Now You See Me' to is one of my all-time favorites: 'Sneakers' - another caper movie with a killer ensemble cast, a great sense of humor, and an interesting story to tell. Remove the high-tech trappings of 'Sneakers' and replace it with the flourish of a little old-fashioned sleight-of-hand - keep the fun and the action and the surprises coming, and you'll come close to the experience of 'Now You See Me.'&#34;What is magic?

1648053,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00CIXVAN8,RMurray847,"[4, 8]","NOW YOU SEE ME thinks that it's a really smart, twisty movie.  I suspect it secretly hopes to be this year's INCEPTION or even THE PRESTIGE (both smart, twisty movies from Christopher Nolan of THE DARK KNIGHT fame).  Heck, it even has Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman from the BATMAN movies.  But it is NOT all that smart.  It does have a lot of twists, yes, but as the movie goes on, they become less and less convincing.Early in the film, we meet 4 magicians who are not exactly the most successful prestidigitators out there (Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco).  But they are called together to a mysterious apartment in NYC and given a mysterious mission.  A year later, with the support of mogul Michael Caine, they are playing a huge crowd at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, where they transport an audience member to the inside of his vault in Paris.  They bring him back, along with the 3 million euros that were in the vault, and they shower the money upon the audience.  Thus, the police are now very interested in this group (called The Four Horsemen), but are unable to keep them because unless the FBI is willing to admit they believe in magic, they have no way of showing HOW the crime could have been committed.The investigation is led by agent Mark Ruffalo (at his most rumpled) who is perplexed by these magicians and goaded by their taunting.  He is soon aided by an Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent from INGLORIOUS BASTERDS), and even assisted to some degree by professional magic debunker Morgan Freeman.  Freeman mostly serves the purpose of telling Ruffalo (and thus the audience) how the tricks are done.  These reveals range from amusing and moderately clever to eventually ridiculously elaborate, dangerous and expensive.  I won't give any more details, but let's just say that The Four Horsemen are apparently brilliant cat-burglars, drivers, engineers and even MMA fighters.The film, thus, grows from being quite interesting and engaging into something that really stretches credibility.  At first, we're willing to be drawn along for the ride...but after a while, the antics grow too big (and yet too predictable at the same time).  You're meant to get really involved in wondering who the puppet-master behind all this might be (and you're given a few red herrings along the way)...but I was not terribly invested.The performers are varyingly successful.  Freeman & Caine give us the same quality (but uninspired) work they so often do when allowed to take a paycheck role.  (Please don't get me wrong...Caine is capable even now of the most delicate and gripping performances [HARRY BROWN springs to mind], but he is coasting here).  Eisenberg is at his most annoying here, but it fits his character.  Harrelson is always fun and brings enjoyable energy, easily stealing his scenes.  Fisher is wasted, and Dave Franco (James' brother) mostly fades into the background.  But the magicians become less and less central, and Ruffalo and Laurent become more important.  I like both of these actors, but here their chemistry is forced and the script doesn't do them any favors.I had an okay time at NOW YOU SEE ME because I naturally like trying to outguess tricky movies.  And the basic concept of the film is actually pretty solid.  But the execution is lacking.  The movie wants to feel like a big summer blockbuster...but it needs a properly scaled down feel and a bit more at stake.  The camera work consists mostly of swirly, 360 degree sweeps.  The characters go from engaging to cardboard.  And the plot (and this type of movie is first and foremost about the plot) is ultimately unsatisfying and perhaps quite full of holes.  But I didn't care enough to try to figure out those holes.  And that is not a good sign.  2.5 stars.",3,"2.5 stars.

also.The film reunites stars Eisenberg and Harrelson,since their first collaboration in Zombieland.The story finds four single act magicians,one who specializes in lock picking,bending spoons,etc,the other a mentalist,the other a card trick master and lastly an escape artiste.They one day all get a special card telling them to meet at an apartment.Inside they are given instructions by remote,and a year later they are all in Vegas doing a joint act;now known as the Four Horsemen.In Vegas they ""pick"" out a visiting Frenchman from the vast audience and have him ""rob"" his personal bank in Paris,through ""teleportation"".After the show the bank in Paris has indeed been robbed and the four are arrested by the FBI.Without just cause and total lack of connection,the foursome are let go.We are introduced to a debunker who has been following the four and wants to expose them and will follow them to the end.The next big trick is in New Orleans.This time they have their benefactor/backer on stage with them.As they have each member of the audience check their bank accounts,the audience finds theirs going up while the funds are coming out of their benefactors account,much to his chagrin.After the show their mentor,who is now seeing red,finds the debunker and puts him on the payroll to expose them.The groups last big trick is in New York where there is a safe loaded with multi millions of dollars.Through their usual means,the group manages to spirit the safe away right from under the FBI noses.After all is said and done the FBI investigator who has been so far behind this group arrests the debunker.The debunker never saw it coming,neither did we,that the lead FBI man was somehow behind it all.Meanwhile the four have appeared in Central Park at a tree containing a card left behind by a long dead magician called Shrike.The four put their original cards together,which activates the card in the tree,which in turn starts a nearby carousel moving.In front of the carousel is the FBI agent,who welcomes them to the ""eye"" .They all board the carousel and ""disappear"".Time passes and a French Interpol agent who was working with the FBI agent on the case from the start,is sitting on a bench on a bridge in Paris,when the agent appears.It is learned he is the son of the long dead magician.Along with revenge on the debunker who humiliated his father,he got revenge on the company that produced the sub par steel in the safe his father drowned in,and the bank and the benefactor of the Horsemen who originally refused to pay on the insurance claim.Fade out.The film itself resembles a magic act before your eyes,as deception after deception is played out by multiple characters and we,like the audience in the film,are often fooled and amazed.Some of the tricks are explained and others are not(hey there are some secrets that are sacred after all).When it all comes down to the end of the film,like Harrelson's charcater says""I didn't see that coming"".All the actors do a tremendous job together and obviously had some fun doing this film.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette and commentary.All in all a nicely done who done it,wrapped in the guise of a huge magic act,with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing right to the end.A solid four stars,and maybe

1648055,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00CIXVAN8,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 6]","Now You See Me (Louis Leterrier, 2013)The last time Louis Leterrier and Morgan Freeman got together to make a movie, the result was 2005's Danny the Dog, released in America as Unleashed. It's widely (if you define ""widely"" as ""critical reaction as measured by both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes and public reaction as measured by IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes"") considered Leterrier's best movie by a country mile (as of this writing), and this reviewer is not inclined to disagree; I adore Danny the Dog something fierce, and much of Leterrier's other work (two films in the Transporter franchise and remakes of The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans) are epitomes of the brainless action film; what sets Danny the Dog apart is its fearsome intelligence. And when I saw a trailer for Now You See Me and noticed it was directed by Leterrier, I had hopes that same intelligence would be back, and so I wandered out to see it despite it having a trio of my least favorite actors currently working in Hollywood all in starring roles: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Mark Ruffalo. And even there, there was a mitigating factor: the one time I have so far been able to stand Jesse Eisenberg on a screen was in Zombieland, and his co-star there was Harrelson, turning in his best role since Natural Born Killers. Whaddya know?Sadly, the high hopes I had were not all realized, though I in no way mean to imply that Now You See Me is not Leterrier's best flick since Danny the Dog. It is that, and it manages to be a slick, fun little heist film despite some woeful casting choices and a script (penned by Boaz Yakin, responsible for such timeless classics of motion pictures as Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money and Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights) that managed to avoid any semblance of character development. If Leterrier has re-teamed with Luc Besson, who wrote Danny the Dog, they might have come up with a movie just as good.Plot: as we begin, four street magicians, Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg), his former assistant Henley Reeves (Wedding Crashers' Isla Fisher), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) and grifter/prestidigitator Jack Wilder (Warm Bodies' David Franco), finish up various performances and discover tarot cards with a date, time, and address in New York City. When they get to the apartment, they find, in the words of a famous space traveller, ""something wonderful."" Fast-forward a year later, and the four of them are now known as the Four Horsemen, slick TV magicians headlining Vegas, looking like run-of-the-mill David Copperfield wannabes until the final trick of one performance, where they appear to rob a bank... and when the folks at the bank (located in Paris) open the vault, well, 3.2 million Euros has vanished into thin air. Needless to say, this draws the attention of the Las Vegas PD, in the form of Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), who quickly finds himself paired with a gorgeous Interpol agent from Pairs, Alma Dray (Inglorious Basterds' M&eacute;lanie Laurent). The Horsemen left some clues to their next performance, to be held in New Orleans three days hence; can Rhodes and Laurent, with the reluctant help of professional debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Freeman), head off the Horsemen and their millionaire backer Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine)?When the movie is good, it is very, very good. It's beautifully shot, and I'm intrigued by the fact that what should have been perfectly standard thriller shots seemed like they shouldn't have been in this flick and were thus a surprise (for example, the rooftop of a building in New York City; how many thrillers have you seen that in? And yet it seemed brand new here; much credit to co-DPs Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong). That takes some doing, and it's more impressive than the movie's magic tricks. Woody Harrelson turns in his most affable performance since Zombieland, and I almost, almost didn't hate Mark Ruffalo. Now that takes some doing. On the other hand, Jesse Eisenberg has made himself a career, rather like Tom Cruise did, of getting up on a screen and playing Jesse Eisenberg. (I am still convinced the only reason he was so good in Zombieland is because the screenwriter wrote the character specifically for him.) There's  enough good acting here to balance out Eisenberg, but he's still annoying. So maybe the complete and utter lack of character development that I think has been addressed in every review written on this movie to date is actually a good thing; if this script had tried to delve into Eisenberg's character, we may have gotten more of him. ** ",3,Jesse the Dog?,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,4562,"['Now', 'See', 'Me', 'Louis', 'Leterrier', '2013', 'last', 'time', 'Louis',

They left it off where this could potentially become a series which might be nice.  I figured most things out but the ending I didn't see coming.

It mixes elemnts from a lot of diffirent shows and movies.  You could think of the team in a kind of leverage (the show) type of way.  It also had some elements of national treasure which might spoil some things so I wont go into detail.  I however didn't see it being anything like oceans so don't try and compare the two.

Like the Stanely Donen classic, &#8220;Now You See Me&#8221; is built on a series of plot twists and character turns in which no one or nothing is quite what it appears to be.The always engaging Mark Ruffalo is the skeptical FBI agent trying to catch the criminals in the act, while old pros Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman have the time of their professional lives as a veteran magician and a veteran magician debunker, respectively. Their scenes together are alone worth the price of admission. And Ruffalo is perfection as the slightly disheveled and perpetually outmaneuvered law enforcer who finds himself up against a quartet of antagonists who always manage to be a good half-dozen or so steps ahead of him.It&#8217;s hard to overstate just how much fun this movie turns out to be, with well-earned kudos going to Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt for their infinitely imaginative screenplay, Louis Leterrier for his turbocharged direction, and all the technical wizards who&#8217;ve engaged in a little legerdemain of their own by making the magic scenes so seamless and convincing.And if it all doesn&#8217;t seem entirely plausible in the end, and you walk away with the nagging suspicion that the writers must have cheated in some way - well, that IS the power of magic, after all.Hollywood filmmakers please take note: THIS is how you make a crowd-pleasing blockbuster!",4,A Hollywood blockbuster that's actually fun.

The twist of course is they never actually rob anyone -- or do they?  The FBI pursues them as bank robbers but they use magic to keep ahead of the authorities.  Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as an iconolast determined to expose them and show their magic is really just tricks.

As always, Morgan Freeman is great and quite a performer. The story line is also interesting, and it has all the required twist and turns to keep you interested right to the very end.

1648148,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00CIXVAN8,The People's Critic,"[5, 7]","In 2006's The Prestige, Michael Caine plays a magician mentor who says, ""Making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back.""  In Now You See Me, Caine plays a very different character who in one scene learns this lesson in a very painful way.  Now You See Me is like The Prestige-Lite, but that doesn't mean it's not good.According to Now You See Me, successful illusions are the result of misdirection and timing. In a summer teeming with sequels, it is refreshing to see an occasional original idea hit the theaters, and it is this misdirection and successful timing that perhaps enhances the appeal of this film.  In one of the year's most enjoyable opening scenes, four unique illusionists (Jessie Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco) are drawn together by a mysterious individual who provides them with the blueprints to a spectacular act that only they are capable of performing as a team.  The team, now known as the Four Horsemen, begins performing a series of illusions that involve various heists including the robbery of a major Paris bank.  Ironically, the spoils of these robberies go not to the victors but to the audience of the show!  This Robin Hood-esque form of vigilantism draws the attention of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who is given the exceptionally difficult task of proving exactly how the Four Horsemen are guilty of these robberies.Casting is by far one of the film's major attributes.  Eisenberg's awkward, self-deprecating persona is put aside for one with much stronger bravado; watching him play J. Daniel Atlas is sort of like watching him play Mark Zuckerberg on personality steroids, in other words - kind of great.  Woody Harrelson does a great job as mentalist Merritt McKinney, which he plays kind of like Sherlock Holmes...on personality steroids - so also kind of great.  Dave Franco and Isla Fisher are very effective, but far less central to the film's development.  Ruffalo and his partner Alma (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) are great at revealing the frustration of chasing down the clever illusionists, and Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine expertly provide further dimension to the story by exploring the darker side of ""magic's"" purpose.Now You See Me has a lot of fun with its premise.  Director, Louis Leterrier packs the film with style and tricks of the trade that keep the story moving and rather captivating.  Leterrier, mostly known for action films like The Incredible Hulk and the first two Transporter films, takes a crack at an ensemble piece where he must balance story with numerous characters - all the while keeping the audience in the dark about the exact motivations of these characters.  He is mostly successful at this, but the film requires a rather high level of suspension of disbelief and some serious overlooking of plot-holes.  It also has a bit of an unevenness to it as Leterrier cannot quite lose his proclivity for action and crowbars a 15 minute car chase smack in the middle of the film.  The scene is brilliantly shot and very exciting, but it also involves virtually none of the film's main characters and thus, feels a bit superfluous.Now You See Me is a lot of fun and fortunately, it does not run out of steam at the end.  Too often films like this are all set-up and no delivery, but the ending of Now You See Me is satisfying and very appropriate.  Hopefully, Now You See Me will find an audience and remind movie studios that once in a while an original idea is worth their consideration before they green-light Fast and Furious 12: Where Did I Put My Keys?

1648155,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00CIXVAN8,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 4]","Now You See Me (2013)****Four magicians, each with a very different shtick, (played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Lookout"") and Dave Franco (""Warm Bodies"", ""21 Jump Street"") receive Tarot cards directing them to a run-down apartment in Brooklyn. After a few moments of general confusion (""oh, you're here as well?"") they uncover the plans for an elaborate magic illusion. Fast forward and the group is now headlining in Vegas as The Four Horseman. Their sponsor, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) watches with disinterest from the audience. Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and his assistant also sit quietly in the audience, filming the entire show; Thaddeus has made a career of debunking the claims and magic of popular acts. The group calls a random audience member to the stage and manages to transport him, to the interior of his bank's vault, in Paris, where he grabs millions of euros just before they begin to rain down on the audience in Vegas. Enter reluctant FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who is called in to investigate. But the Four Horsemen are quickly released and move on to their next venue, New Orleans and their next illusion.Thus begins ""Now You See Me"", a very fast-paced, well-made caper film directed by Louis Letterier (""The Transporter"", ""Taken"") and written by Ed Solomon and Boaz Yakim. ""See Me"" is a fun, easy to watch film perfect for the summer popcorn crowd.  The film is not without problems; there are a few too many third act plot twists which aren't established enough to connect to the rest of the story. While this does detract from the overall effort, the rest of the film is good enough to help you overlook this.""See Me"" is also a very slick film, which is both good and bad. As the narrative barrels along, it keeps us interested, but it doesn't provide a lot of time for character development. As each of the characters is introduced, we get a brief moment showing us a little of their lives, but that is pretty much it. J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) is in Vegas captivating a crowd of pretty young women; he is putting the moves on one of the girls in his swanky bachelor pad when he realizes he has the Tarot card. Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) is doing hypnosis tricks at Caf&eacute; du Monde in New Orleans when he gets his card. Henley Reeves (Fisher) is performing an elaborate escape act, complete with a straitjacket and piranhas, in a Los Angeles club. Jack Wilder (Franco) is doing cheap tricks for a group of tourists on a New York ferry, trying to scam them out of a tenner. When they initially meet at the address in Brooklyn, we learn some know each other, some have heard of others, but that is it. When they uncover the secret plans, they are captivated and the narrative shifts forward a year and we rejoin them as the Four Horsemen.Interpol agent Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent, ""Inglourious Basterds"") enters the picture after the illusion involving the French bank and tags along with Dylan. But they always seem to be one step behind the clever magicians.Letterier, the director of ""Clash of the Titans (2010)"", ""The Incredible Hulk (2008)"" and ""The Transporter"" films is a director who seems intent on creating summer popcorn films, films filled with fast-paced action, lots of special effects and little or no character development. ""The Transporter"" films were a blast, but since then Letterier has had difficulty finding the right balance. In ""Now You See Me"", the director uses great CGI to almost convince us the magicians are performing real illusions. Unfortunately, because the CGI is so good, it isn't believable. And the late-in-the-narrative explanation of how the magic was possible just doesn't cut it either.In ""See Me"", Letterier seems to have found the right vehicle for his limited storytelling skills. I only wish he had been able to create a little bit of character development, fleshing out the performances to make them more interesting. In a way, because the production values are so high, the lack of character development is more noticeable and makes the film seem unbalanced and the experience seem hollow. Learning something, anything about them would forge a stronger connection with the viewer and make us care about them just a little more. Note to all filmmakers; even the smallest amount of character development will improve your film immensely.Generally, if we don't learn specifically about the characters, their actions and the plot will lead us to learn something about them. But the four magicians are following a detailed set of instructions and seem clueless as to their purpose or the final outcome. So, that doesn't work either.Rhodes (Ruffalo) is reluctantly paired with Alma. As they chase the magicians, we see a relationship building between them, but this is the only one in the entire film. And they aren't the central characters - I'm not sure anyone could be considered the star, there are too many people running around, playing a part  - so it seems odd to be given more information about these characters than others.My biggest problem with ""See Me"" is there are too many third-act plot twists. The key to a good plot twist is there needs to be a subtle hint or connection to something we have witnessed earlier. The best plot twists involve something you have seen, but no longer remember. When the twist happens, a light goes off in your head. ""Oh, yeah."" In ""See Me"", there just aren't connections to the many, many twists. If they are there, they are too subtle. Because these moments seem to simply materialize out of thin air, the movie's credibility wanes and wobbles and quickly devolves into a bad episode of ""Murder She Wrote"".I know the problems don't really seem small or insignificant, but when weighed against the overall effect of the entire film, they seem to be less important. Maybe Letterier has created an illusion of his own?""Now You See Me"" is a fun bit of fantasy, perfect to help you make a few hours disappear.Get ready for a sequel.",4,"Breezy, Summer

1648156,A2LNVIYOP4RTO5,B00CIXVAN8,THREEKAY,"[0, 1]","Directed by Loius Letterier, Produced by Bobby Cohen/Alex Kurtzman/Roberto Orci, Starring Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Melanie Laurent, Isla Fisher, and Morgan Freeman.Storyline: Four street magicians (experts in their own tricks), come together through an invitation from an unknown person. The union emerges as &#8216;The Four Horsemen&#8217;. The first stage show and the subsequent ones of this new brand, specializes in giving huge performances, that target specific people from the audience to hypnotize them and later use them as pawns to steal huge money from vaults of big banks across the world.FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes takes up investigation of this case, along with the gorgeous Interpol agent Alma Dray. They find out that &#8216;The Four Horsemen&#8217; gang is targeting only those people who were responsible for the death of a famous magician, Lionel Shirke, who was humiliated and died in an accident 30 years ago, after his tricks exposed by his counterpart, Thaddeus. The Four Horsemen loot the bank Credit Republicain de Paris and Tressler&#8217;s insurance company that refused to settle the insurance of Lionel Shirke&#8217;s  death. They, finally trick Thaddeus, to get him arrested.The surprise comes in climax, when The Four Horsemen stage their final show in New York to steal a safe and transfer the money to Thaddeus&#8217;s car, giving an impression to the police that Thaddeus is the  actual culprit behind the robberies. This is when The Four Horsemen get to see the fifth Horseman, in hiding all the while and that happens to be the FBI Agent Dylan himself. Dylan claims to have done all this to take revenge on all those who were responsible for the death of his father Lionel Shirke, but never ever to be found by the Police.Positives: A wonderful twist at the end which surprises the audience. Magicians and many of their tricks revealed. A grave truth that modern magic is nowadays being used for huge financial gains rather than just providing entertainment to public, like once upon a time. The audience could never guess the secret of the fifth Horseman. Plot was well designed. Good screenplay and good music. Free flowing pure entertainment. Melanie Laurent and Morgan Freeman, are my favorites, in the movie.Negatives: Gives a negative approach towards the FBI and Interpol which could be tricked so easily by some street magicians, while looting heavy amount from banks and insurance companies. The revelation of the fifth Horseman could have been a little more exciting.My rating is 3.5 out of 5",3,A movie which exposes the modern commercial magicians,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,2557,"['Directed', 'Loius', 'Letterier', 'Produced', 'Bobby', 'Cohen/Alex', 'Kurtzman/Roberto', 'Orci', 'Starring', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Melanie', 'Laurent', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Morgan', 'Freeman.Storyline', 'Four', 'street', 'magicians', 'experts', 'own', 'tricks', 'come', 'together', 'invitation', 'unknown', 'person', 'union', '8216', 'Four', 'Horsemen', '8217', 'first', 'stage', 'show', 'subsequent', 'ones', 'new', 'brand', 'giving', 'huge', 'performances', 'target', 'specific', 'people', 'audience', 'hypnotize', 'later', 'use', 'pawns', 'steal', 'huge', 'money', 'vaults', 'big', 'banks', 'world.FBI', 'Agent', 'Dylan', 'Rhodes', 'up', 'investigation', 'case', 'gorgeous', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'Alma', 'Dray', 'find', 'out', '8216', 'Four', 'Horsemen', '8217', 'gang', 'targeting', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'death', 'famous', 'magician', 'Lionel', 'Shirke', 'who', 'was', 'humiliated', 'died', 'accident', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'tricks', 'exposed', 'counterpart', 'Thaddeus', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'bank', 'Credit', 'Republicain', 'Paris', 'Tressler', '8217', 's', 'insurance', 'company', 'refused', 'settle', 'insurance', 'Lionel', 'Shirke', '8217', 's', 'death', 'finally', 'trick', 'Thaddeus', 'get', 'arrested.The', 'surprise', 'climax', 'when', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'stage', 'final', 'show', 'New', 'York', 'steal', 'safe', 'transfer', 'money', 'Thaddeus', '8217', 's', 'car', 'giving', 'impression', 'police', 'Thaddeus', 'actual', 'culprit', 'robberies', 'when', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'get', 'see', 'fifth', 'Horseman', 'hiding', 'while', 'be', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Dylan', 'Dylan', 'have', 'done', 'take', 'revenge', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'death', 'father', 'Lionel', 'Shirke', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'found', 'Police.Positives', 'wonderful', 'twist', 'end', 'audience', 'Magicians', 'many', 'tricks', 'revealed', 'grave', 'truth', 'modern', 'magic', 'nowadays', 'being', 'used', 'huge', 'financial', 'gains', 'rather', 'just', 'providing', 'entertainment', 'public', 'once', 'time', 'audience', 'could', 'never', 'guess', 'secret', 'fifth', 'Horseman', 'Plot', 'was', 'well', 'designed', 'Good', 'screenplay', 'good', 'music', 'Free', 'flowing', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'Melanie', 'Laurent', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'favorites', 'movie.Negatives', 'negative', 'approach', 'FBI', 'Interpol', 'could', 'be', 'tricked', 'so', 'easily', 'street', 'magicians', 'looting', 'heavy', 'amount', 'banks', 'insurance', 'companies', 'revelation', 'fifth', 'Horseman', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'exciting.My', 'rating', '3.5', '5']",N/A

There is just something about the concept of ""magic"" that I think really translates well into the cinema.  Unfortunately, ""Now You See Me"" doesn't take full advantage of those possibilities.For a basic plot summary, this film sees a famous magician (Jesse Eisenberg), an up-and-coming conjurer (Dave Franco), a beautiful stage performer (Isla Fisher), and a mentalist (Woody Harrelson) team up to create the greatest performance of magic ever seen.  When they supposedly rob a bank through the use of magic, they draw the interest of an investigator (Mark Ruffalo) and a ""magician debunker"" (Morgan Freeman) to try and find out just what the heck is going on.""Now You See Me"" is a movie filled with a lot of ""flash"".  The chemistry between the actors is very entertaining, the action scenes are visually impressive, and the film moves along at a brisk case.  Those watching it in theaters were likely consuming a lot of popcorn and getting a large number of thrills from the experiences.The trouble is (and what cements this movie as decidedly average) that the flick promises far too much than what it can actually deliver.  For example, ""The Prestige"" promises to bend the mind but then actually does it.  Here, director Louis Leterrier promises similar things (he sets up the movie like it will amaze you in the end), but instead just provides a ho-hum ending.Thus, it isn't so much that the film is bad, per se, but rather that it promises the world and only delivers a sliver.  You might like it for the pizzazz and crackling dialogue/action, but don't expect anything mind-blowing (confusion is more of the end result).",3,A Lot Of Flash But Too Little Substance,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,1743,"['Movies', 'magic', 'have', 'always', 'intrigued', 'consider', 'Prestige', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'all-time', 'just', 'something', 'concept', 'magic', 'think', 'really', 'well', 'cinema', 'Unfortunately', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', ""n't"", 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'possibilities.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'famous', 'magician', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'up-and-coming', 'conjurer', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'beautiful', 'stage', 'performer', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'mentalist', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'team', 'up', 'create', 'greatest', 'performance', 'magic', 'ever', 'seen', 'When', 'supposedly', 'rob', 'bank', 'use', 'magic', 'draw', 'interest', 'investigator', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'magician', 'debunker', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'heck', 'going', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', 'movie', 'filled', 'lot', 'flash', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'very', 'entertaining', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'visually', 'impressive', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'brisk', 'case', 'watching', 'theaters', 'were', 'likely', 'consuming', 'lot', 'popcorn', 'getting', 'large', 'number', 'thrills', 'experiences.The', 'trouble', 'what', 'movie', 'decidedly', 'average', 'flick', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'can', 'actually', 'deliver', 'example', 'Prestige', 'bend', 'mind', 'then', 'actually', 'Here', 'director', 'Louis', 'Leterrier', 'similar', 'things', 'up', 'movie', 'will', 'amaze', 'end', 'instead', 'just', 'ho-hum', 'ending.Thus', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'film', 'bad', 'se', 'rather', 'world', 'only', 'delivers', 'sliver', 'might', 'like', 'pizzazz', 'crackling', 'dialogue/action', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'mind-blowing', 'confusion', 'more', 'end', 'result']",N/A

It just falls short.One of this film's good qualities is its ability to keep you wondering how the heck X did Y.  Lots of tricks and twists to keep your attention.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of awe-inspiring, magical occurrences that are never explained and border heavily on the magic in Dungeons and Dragons, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings--take your pick.  (SPOILERS IN NEXT SENTENCE)  Like floating through the air in a bubble, jumping off a building and bursting into flame, etc.Then there are some highly unrealistic scenes that in real life would require a team of engineers and roadies bigger than Metallica tours with.  (SPOILERS IN NEXT TWO SENTENCES)  Yet the FOUR Horsemen miraculously make a series of buildings transform into their multimedia circus without ANYONE being the wiser, for example.  And move around INCREDIBLY heavy safes with ease in minutes.  I cannot move a refrigerator without a handtruck and another person!  I know Franco and Harrelson are manly men, but come on.Thirdly, and most frustrating, is the inclusion of the secret society of mages.  Ok, cool idea.  Love it!  It makes you wonder if this society holds the secret to &#34;real&#34; magic like the stuff we see in Harry Potter or if it is just an incredible arcane intelligentsia.  Or both.Unfortunately, we never find out.  They just ARE.  You can argue it is a smokescreen.Then we get a twist no one sees coming, but it means very little in the whole scheme of things.  The magicians go from being magical vigilantes (sort of) to pawns in a bigger plot that really could have been handled better with a Glock.  That's all I'll say.The movie had great potential when the magicians bond together and start committing crimes for good.  They should have stuck with that premise.  We could have had some amazing sequels too.The action is intense.  Franco is incredible in his fight and flight scenes.  All of the acting is superb.  Woody Harrelson's mentalism is enthralling.  The way the camerawork is used, you get a sense of how the different forms of magic are done.  So no info-dumps or boring explanations.  That was a creative way to present the characters.You WILL be entertained, but ultimately disappointed that they did not build something bigger and more meaningful.",4,More Flash Than Content,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,2377,"['good', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'advocated', 'avoiding', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'just', 'short.One', 'film', 'good', 'qualities', 'ability', 'keep', 'wondering', 'how', 'heck', 'X', 'did', 'Y', 'Lots', 'tricks', 'twists', 'keep', 'attention', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'lot', 'awe-inspiring', 'magical', 'occurrences', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'border', 'heavily', 'magic', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'take', 'pick', 'SPOILERS', 'IN', 'NEXT', 'SENTENCE', 'floating', 'air', 'bubble', 'jumping', 'off', 'building', 'bursting', 'flame', 'etc.Then', 'are', 'highly', 'unrealistic', 'scenes', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'require', 'team', 'engineers', 'roadies', 'bigger', 'Metallica', 'tours', 'SPOILERS', 'IN', 'NEXT', 'TWO', 'SENTENCES', 'Yet', 'FOUR', 'Horsemen', 'miraculously', 'make', 'series', 'buildings', 'transform', 'multimedia', 'circus', 'ANYONE', 'being', 'wiser', 'example', 'move', 'around', 'INCREDIBLY', 'heavy', 'safes', 'ease', 'minutes', 'can', 'not', 'move', 'refrigerator', 'handtruck', 'person', 'know', 'Franco', 'Harrelson', 'are', 'manly', 'men', 'come', 'on.Thirdly', 'most', 'frustrating', 'inclusion', 'secret', 'society', 'mages', 'Ok', 'cool', 'idea', 'Love', 'wonder', 'society', 'secret', '34', 'real', '34', 'magic', 'stuff', 'see', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'just', 'incredible', 'arcane', 'intelligentsia', 'both.Unfortunately', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'ARE', 'can', 'argue', 'smokescreen.Then', 'get', 'twist', 'one', 'coming', 'very', 'little', 'whole', 'scheme', 'things', 'magicians', 'go', 'being', 'magical', 'vigilantes', 'sort', 'pawns', 'bigger', 'plot', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'Glock', ""'ll"", 'say.The', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'when', 'magicians', 'bond', 'together', 'start', 'committing', 'crimes', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'premise', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'amazing', 'sequels', 'too.The', 'action', 'intense', 'Franco', 'incredible', 'fight', 'flight', 'scenes', 'acting', 'superb', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'mentalism', 'enthralling', 'way', 'camerawork', 'used', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'different', 'forms', 'magic', 'are', 'done', 'info-dumps', 'boring', 'explanations', 'was', 'creative', 'way', 'present', 'characters.You', 'WILL', 'be', 'entertained', 'ultimately', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'build', 'something', 'bigger', 'more', 'meaningful']",N/A

Kabir,"[0, 3]","don't watch this movie! what a huuuuuge waste of time. no real plot. the twist at the end wasn't even a good twist. i watched the whole thing hoping that they would turn it around. the idea of illusion and the detail in which they 'tricked' people was pretty interesting and smart, however, what a waste of a movie. here are all the reasons you shouldn't watch this movie:- bad acting by all except for maybe woody harrelson- the plot was convoluted, filled with nonsense and did not follow any story format. it's as if all these scenes were stitched together by a complete stranger- the twist at the end - huh? why? who cares! it wasn't even stitched together or explained properly at the end- the chemistry between all characters - none. had they not done a test screen to test the chemistry?- the french interpol agent - again, why? who cares! unnecessary!If I could give it negative stars, I would. Also, can I please have my money back?",1,the ratings are misleading!!!,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,941,"['do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'what', 'huuuuuge', 'waste', 'time', 'real', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'twist', 'i', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'hoping', 'would', 'turn', 'around', 'idea', 'illusion', 'detail', ""'tricked"", 'people', 'was', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'smart', 'however', 'what', 'waste', 'movie', 'here', 'are', 'reasons', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'bad', 'acting', 'maybe', 'woody', 'harrelson-', 'plot', 'was', 'convoluted', 'filled', 'nonsense', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'story', 'format', 'scenes', 'were', 'stitched', 'together', 'complete', 'stranger-', 'twist', 'end', 'huh', 'why', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'stitched', 'together', 'explained', 'properly', 'end-', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'none', 'had', 'not', 'done', 'test', 'screen', 'test', 'chemistry', 'french', 'interpol', 'agent', 'again', 'why', 'who', 'unnecessary', 'could', 'give', 'negative', 'stars', 'would', 'Also', 'can', 'please', 'have', 'money', 'back']",N/A
