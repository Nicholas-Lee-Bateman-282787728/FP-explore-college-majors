Paramount is in danger of losing their audience by releasing a 20-year series in 39 installments.  I was 10 years old when the first season aired - Many viewers were much older.  At the planned rate, how many of the original fans of the early seasons will not live to see the release of the complete series?  THEY are the customers for these B&W half-hour shows.  THEY are nostaglgic for these shows from their youth.  THEY are the higher-paid segment of our society who can better afford to buy full runs of long-lived TV shows.  Many of today's young viewers will not watch black & white TV - or are more interested in series of more recent vintage.  I urge everyone to WRITE TO PARAMOUNT AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR PLANS FOR THESE GUNSMOKE DVD RELEASES.  Studios DO respond to customer pressure.  Fox relented to customer pressure to offer an alternative packaging for the Simpsons DVD sets.  Paramount brought Star Trek back to TV after fans launched a letter-writing campaign.  It's not too late to make Paramount re-think their plans for next year's DVD releases.",1,Gunsmoke: The Second Season Vol 1,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,1188,"['SHAME', 'ON', 'PARAMOUNT', 'should', 'offer', 'full', 'seasons', 'fair', 'price', 'Fans', 'will', 'willingly', 'pay', 'more', 'get', 'FULL', 'sesaons', 'Paramount', 'danger', 'losing', 'audience', 'releasing', '20-year', 'series', '39', 'installments', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'first', 'season', 'aired', 'Many', 'viewers', 'were', 'much', 'older', 'planned', 'rate', 'how', 'many', 'original', 'fans', 'early', 'seasons', 'will', 'not', 'live', 'see', 'release', 'complete', 'series', 'THEY', 'are', 'customers', 'B', 'W', 'half-hour', 'shows', 'THEY', 'are', 'nostaglgic', 'shows', 'youth', 'are', 'higher-paid', 'segment', 'society', 'who', 'can', 'better', 'afford', 'buy', 'full', 'runs', 'long-lived', 'TV', 'shows', 'Many', 'today', 'young', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'series', 'more', 'recent', 'vintage', 'urge', 'everyone', 'WRITE', 'TO', 'PARAMOUNT', 'AND', 'COMPLAIN', 'ABOUT', 'THEIR', 'THESE', 'GUNSMOKE', 'DVD', 'RELEASES', 'Studios', 'DO', 'respond', 'customer', 'pressure', 'Fox', 'relented', 'customer', 'pressure', 'offer', 'alternative', 'packaging', 'Simpsons', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Paramount', 'brought', 'Star', 'Trek', 'back', 'TV', 'fans', 'launched', 'letter-writing', 'campaign', 'not', 'too', 'late', 'make', 'Paramount', 're-think', 'plans', 'next', 'year', 'DVD']",N/A

In fact, I even bought Season 1 for my 79 year old neighbors.  Great job by Paramount's pricing team on setting the new Season 2 price point at $50+ per FULL SEASON!  $50 X 20 seasons = $1,000 for the series??? Lets see ... should people buy these ridiculously overpriced 50 year old shows (as great as they were), or send their child to college???? Not such a tough choice is it?  Think about this for a brief moment folks.  It's all about Paramount's greed as virtually all this dough goes into their pocket as there were no DVD or video royalty payment rights back then. Paramount thought they found the ""Golden Goose"" when all of us Gunsmoke fans showed our loyalty to the 50 year old content and invested in season 1. Even at the ""decent"" Season 1 price, it would still cost the average hardworking American over $500 to invest in the full series.

1107438,A268TJ88VHO5IP,B000W8OM68,Arbitrator,"[1, 2]","I was very pleasantly surprised with the originality of the stories in this second season. Twists and surprises which shatter a lot of the stereotypes of 1950's TV westerns.(Mild Spoiler Warning for what follows...)Unlike most western ""good guys"" Matt Dillon is a realist; willing to bend the rules a bit to enforce the law in a hard-bitten town like Dodge City. For example, in one episode he draws first to kill a gunman who wants to make his mark by shooting down a U.S. marshal. We've all seen so many one-on-one shootouts in westerns, how can anyone write one that's original? Well, this one was. Plus, the bad guy somewhat justifies Dillon's action by trying to creep his gunhand onto the gun before actually drawing. (Obviously if you have your trigger finger ON the trigger before actually drawing the revolver, you're going to have an edge... unless you're confronting a marshal like Matt Dillon who's savvy and realist enough to draw first!) Of course, drawing first even for a lawman is pushing the limit of righteousness so the storyline evolves into one where the dead gunslinger's brother arrives in Dodge to avenge his death... with a nice final twist that I won't give away.Another episode Dillon and Chester set up a ""sting"" operation to entice 6 seriously bad guys (they've been stealing horses from settlers by slaughtering entire families, including a little girl and making like it's the Pawnee Indians who are to blame---over the edge reprehensibility especially for 50s TV!) into attacking a shed where the pair are hiding. Chester is understandably uncomfortable with the two lawmen confronting 6 armed desperadoes... and he's even more discomforted when Dillon tells him they're going to AMBUSH THE BAD GUYS! Dillon shoots down 4 (not clear if Chester does anything since he's apparently a bit concerned about lawmen ambushing even child-killers); the 2 wounded survivors surrender. They have the gall to deny their guilt and accuse Dillon with murder (""even a lawman can't shoot down innocent people in cold blood!"")... until Matt finds evidence on one of them (a bit of ribbon from the little girl they slaughtered) to prove his case. But, boy, did he take a rather big chance ambushing 6 cowboys who could have been innocent travelers. One wonders what he would have done had he been wrong...Which leads to another episode where Dillon tracks down and wounds a suspected murderer and turns out to have been WRONG. In this case not only was he wrong but he messed up what passes for an investigation (in those days) by not properly checking out the suspect's alibi before spending two days tracking him down and dragging him back wounded to Dodge... only to find out his alibi... Doc's statement... is sound! Well, he does apologize to the wounded cowpoke... who while lamenting how his shoulder will be stiff the rest of his life, does gamely offer to buy Matt a drink if he ever has the misfortune to run into the marshal again!My point here is these stories are clever and original, unpredictable and sometimes even unsettling... much more mature and sophisticated fare than typical for 1950's TV programming of any sort.I share the irritation of others here about the format and delay in bringing out the entire series but for stories alone I give this DVD 5 stars.",5,Original and creative story telling!,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,3296,"['was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'originality', 'stories', 'second', 'season', 'Twists', 'surprises', 'shatter', 'lot', 'stereotypes', '1950', 'TV', 'westerns', 'Mild', 'Spoiler', 'Warning', 'what', 'most', 'western', 'good', 'guys', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'realist', 'willing', 'bend', 'rules', 'bit', 'enforce', 'law', 'hard-bitten', 'town', 'Dodge', 'City', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'first', 'kill', 'gunman', 'who', 'make', 'mark', 'shooting', 'down', 'U.S.', 'marshal', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'one-on-one', 'shootouts', 'westerns', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'write', 'one', 'original', 'Well', 'one', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'somewhat', 'Dillon', 'action', 'trying', 'creep', 'gunhand', 'gun', 'actually', 'drawing', 'Obviously', 'have', 'trigger', 'finger', 'ON', 'trigger', 'actually', 'drawing', 'revolver', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'edge', ""'re"", 'confronting', 'marshal', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'savvy', 'realist', 'enough', 'draw', 'first', 'course', 'drawing', 'first', 'even', 'lawman', 'pushing', 'limit', 'righteousness', 'storyline', 'one', 'where', 'dead', 'gunslinger', 'brother', 'Dodge', 'avenge', 'death', 'nice', 'final', 'twist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away.Another', 'episode', 'Dillon', 'Chester', 'set', 'up', 'sting', 'operation', 'entice', '6', 'seriously', 'bad', 'guys', ""'ve"", 'been', 'stealing', 'horses', 'settlers', 'slaughtering', 'entire', 'families', 'including', 'little', 'girl', 'making', 'Pawnee', 'Indians', 'who', 'are', 'blame', '-over', 'edge', 'reprehensibility', 'especially', '50s', 'TV', 'attacking', 'shed', 'where', 'pair', 'are', 'hiding', 'Chester', 'understandably', 'uncomfortable', 'two', 'lawmen', 'confronting', '6', 'armed', 'desperadoes', 'even', 'more', 'discomforted', 'when', 'Dillon', ""'re"", 'going', 'AMBUSH', 'THE', 'BAD', 'GUYS', 'Dillon', 'shoots', 'down', '4', 'not', 'clear', 'Chester', 'anything', 'apparently', 'bit', 'concerned', 'lawmen', 'ambushing', 'even', 'child-killers', '2', 'wounded', 'survivors', 'surrender', 'have', 'gall', 'deny', 'guilt', 'accuse', 'Dillon', 'murder', 'even', 'lawman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'down', 'innocent', 'people', 'cold', 'blood', 'Matt', 'evidence', 'one', 'bit', 'ribbon', 'little', 'girl', 'slaughtered', 'prove', 'case', 'boy', 'did', 'take', 'rather', 'big', 'chance', 'ambushing', '6', 'cowboys', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'innocent', 'travelers', 'One', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'had', 'been', 'wrong', 'Which', 'episode', 'where', 'Dillon', 'down', 'suspected', 'murderer', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'WRONG', 'case', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'wrong', 'messed', 'up', 'what', 'investigation', 'days', 'not', 'properly', 'checking', 'out', 'suspect', 'alibi', 'spending', 'two', 'days', 'tracking', 'down', 'dragging', 'back', 'wounded', 'Dodge', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'alibi', 'Doc', 'statement', 'sound', 'Well', 'apologize', 'wounded', 'cowpoke', 'who', 'lamenting', 'how', 'shoulder', 'will', 'be', 'stiff', 'rest', 'life', 'gamely', 'offer', 'buy', 'Matt', 'drink', 'ever', 'misfortune', 'run', 'marshal', 'again', 'point', 'here', 'stories', 'are', 'clever', 'original', 'unpredictable', 'sometimes', 'even', 'unsettling', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'sophisticated', 'fare', 'typical', '1950', 'TV', 'programming', 'sort.I', 'share', 'irritation', 'others', 'here', 'format', 'delay', 'bringing', 'out', 'entire', 'series', 'stories', 'alone', 'give', 'DVD', '5', 'stars']",N/A

FOX has been doing the same thing for a while, Lost In Space and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea to name a couple. I think the $26.00 Amazon wants for this box set is very reasonable. The only thing a boycott is going to achieve is Paramount not putting them out at all. People think the studio just slaps these shows together and since they are old it should be dirt cheap. The studios have stopped investing time and money into the restoration of these shows (Gunsmoke is fifty years old as it is) when they find there is not a market for them. How does that old saying go? Cutting off your nose to spite your face? I'm still waiting for FOX to put out season 2 of St Elsewhere!I, too would prefer full seasons at the current average prices of shows from this era of around $40.00, but a lot of people would balk at paying that much for a show this old. The studio probably feels $26.00 is within the budget of it's target market of baby boomers old enough to remember this program.Paramount is one of the only studios left that are restoring these old gems for a new generation to enjoy. Anyone who doubts that, should take a good look at what they have done with the Mission Impossible or Hawaii 5-0 season box sets. They look and sound better than shows half their age.

But for an out-and-out timeless classic like ""Gunsmoke"" to suffer this fate: unacceptable. This, to me, is like disrespecting one's elders, spitting in the face of tradition.Given that this is a groundbreaking show, one would never have thought it would have come to this. A few short years ago, this would have been unheard of. Getting ENTIRE seasons of TV shows was the selling point of buying them on DVD.What is with these stupid trends, anyway? First they start putting out two versions of the same movie (one and two discs, then jacking up the prices of the two disc sets). Then, depending on where you go, there are different features and bonuses on DVDs and CDs (for instance, Target has an additional bonus disc, Wal-Mart has another, etc.). Plus you never seem to get even so much as a booklet or insert inside the DVD case itself, which, at one time, was standard practice. Sometimes there was additional information and tidbits inside, as well as a chapter selection list, all which I personally liked. And now they resort to this. And, on top of all that, absolute zero bonus features (another selling point). Seems like DVDs are beginning to lose the allure they once had. Stuff like this will eventually kill sales entirely.Yes, I might sound hyperbolic about this, but these practices are ridiculous. What next? Are they going to start giving us only one episode at a time? (For ""Gunsmoke"", this would quite literally go on for the rest of my life:-(). Would love to have this, but I don't know. I should do like a previous reviewer said and just buy it used.Content-wise, there simply aren't enough stars to give ""Gunsmoke"". It is a tried-and-true classic. But I cannot give but one star to the DVD treatment, which is a travesty.

CBS/Paramount made a wise decision on their part. They figured since they'd begin releasing a 20 season show, why not try milking as much money as possible out of the viewers. Season 2 VOLUME ONE proves this point. Considering that season 1 was a full 6 disc set and costs about $17 on this site, there is no excuse for releasing half of a season for the same price. As of now, the most current Gunsmoke dvd available is Season 9 Volume 2. That means for 9 seasons, we have to buy 17 separate full priced sets. THATS A RIP-OFF. CBS/Paramount lost my business after season 1. While I have the official season 1 dvd, I've invested in a home-made set which contains all 20 seasons of this show.

Let's hang Paramount by not buying this set!If we don't buy the set and ""Gunsmoke"" goes down the drain, let's let it go!!!!!Marshall Dillon, Chester, Kitty, and Doc all stood for principles, no matter what it took. Let's do the very same thing to honor them even if it means not buying dvd's with them on them! They'd be proud!!!!I only (and have always only) planned to buy the episodes with Chester. So I've already bought the 1955-'56 season at $30-$40 or so. Chester, if I remember correctly was on through the 1963-'64 season. So, at roughly $60.00-$80.00 per  season even I'll have to pay roughly $480-$510-$520, maybe even up to $600 or more (depending upon price variations) for eight more years. To that I say that Paramount's a horse thief and I won't buy!However, I'll tell you what I'll say yeeeeessssssss to-caliing them and sending them MANY letters!!! Hopefully I can find a toll free number somewhere and an physical address. Remember, e-mails do NO GOOD in these types of situations. It's VERY SIMPLE for someone to hit DELETE. However, with physically written notes, they go through the mail room, delivered, hand opened, and read!Let's flood them with calls and mail. They'll get the message. They'll know that we can't be taken for granted, and even if it's ""Gunsmoke"", they'll know that we're not going to fall for their shennanigans. We'll tell them we  won't buy and we'll follow up on our statements and not buy! (sorry, folks, but you have to follow through on what you say and write or they'll never believe you after the first month or two after the set is out-You MUST follow through!! Even if it's out for a month or two and they see that we're following through on what we've said, they might very well turn around and repackage them with a full season!!)  I LOVE the Chester years of Gunsmoke, but not at $480-$600 + $'s. You folks who'd have to pay over $2,000 to go all of the way up through the Festus years, be just as tough.Even if they don't change their minds, let's not buy.

But I happily picked up the first season for my father's birthday and planned to borrow it when he was finished, just like the three Have Gun, Will Travel sets I purchased for him over the past three Christmases. But I don't think I'm going to get the second season for him unless I can find it used. I can understand dividing up an older TV program like Perry Mason with almost 40 episodes in a season when the modern TV season lasts only 22 or 23. However, Perry is an hourlong and averages at least ten minutes longer per episode than modern series. When they start dividing up series like Rawhide with only 15 or 16 episodes per set (with no real extras), it starts to become ridiculous. And to do it with the first seasons of Gunsmoke, when the program was only a half-hour long, and then charging almost as much as the previous release was for half as many episodes... well, it's simply incomprehensible and whoever is in charge of Paramount's TV division needs to get an earful, because they aren't doing their job very well. The show itself is great, and I'm thrilled to see more classic TV coming out that I never had a chance to watch growing up. I hope that studios continue to mine their wells for the shows that aren't seen on TV much anymore as I would much rather they concentrate on them then another 12 episode, flash-in-the-pan reality series.

With the odds against them, Matt and Chester see only one way to end this reign of terror, with bullets and gun-smoke.  Season 1 of Gunsmoke was a nation wide hit and Season 2 went all out to to give viewers what they wanted: hard, gritty drama with cutting edge action.  The whole crew is back; Chester, Doc, Kitty and Matt all teaming up to keep Law & Order in  Dodge City.  If you liked Season 1, you're gonna love Season 2.  As in the previous season the story lines are diverse and range from light hearted humor to intense drama and some shockingly brutal entries.  If anybody doubted that Matt could be a hard man when necessary, those doubts are laid to rest with many of the Season 2 episodes.  The screenplays for each episode are excellent and Sam Peckinpah is again on hand with some outstanding scripts.  As for guest stars, Season 2 has plenty to go around.  Is Cloris Leachman trying to kill her husband? Looks like Sebastian Cabot has his career in focus.  Lovely Angie Dickinson's father is causing her real problems.  Also watch for Mike Connors, Carl Betz, Jack Kelley and Harold J Stone.  For me some of the stand out episodes were: Cow Doctor, The Round Up, No Indians.  But who am I kidding? Each and Every episode is great.  In Season 2 you may see a side of Matt that you never knew was there.  A gun-slinger that can't be touched by the law will still have to answer to Matt, man to man.  Amanda Blake never looked better and some of her outfits will knock your eyes out.  Milburn Stone gives his best performance yet.  Dennis Weaver shines when accused of murder.  And, of course, James Arness giving you a whole new outlook on the Western genre and bringing a brand new meaning to the concept of Rough Justice.Last Ranger",5,Rough Justice,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1934,"['Note', 'review', 'Second', 'Season', 'Vol', '1', '2.Disguised', 'Indians', 'gang', 'renegade', 'whites', 'raiding', 'isolated', 'ranches', 'killing', 'families', 'stealing', 'horses', 'odds', 'Matt', 'Chester', 'see', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'end', 'reign', 'terror', 'bullets', 'gun-smoke', 'Season', '1', 'Gunsmoke', 'was', 'nation', 'wide', 'hit', 'Season', '2', 'went', 'give', 'viewers', 'what', 'wanted', 'hard', 'gritty', 'drama', 'cutting', 'edge', 'action', 'whole', 'crew', 'back', 'Chester', 'Doc', 'Kitty', 'Matt', 'teaming', 'up', 'keep', 'Law', 'Order', 'Dodge', 'City', 'liked', 'Season', '1', ""'re"", 'gon', 'love', 'Season', '2', 'previous', 'season', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'diverse', 'range', 'light', 'hearted', 'humor', 'intense', 'drama', 'shockingly', 'brutal', 'entries', 'anybody', 'doubted', 'Matt', 'could', 'be', 'hard', 'man', 'when', 'necessary', 'doubts', 'are', 'laid', 'rest', 'many', 'Season', '2', 'episodes', 'screenplays', 'episode', 'are', 'excellent', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'again', 'hand', 'outstanding', 'scripts', 'guest', 'stars', 'Season', '2', 'plenty', 'go', 'around', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'trying', 'kill', 'husband', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', 'career', 'focus', 'Lovely', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'father', 'causing', 'real', 'problems', 'Also', 'watch', 'Mike', 'Connors', 'Carl', 'Betz', 'Jack', 'Kelley', 'Harold', 'J', 'Stone', 'stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'were', 'Cow', 'Doctor', 'Round', 'Up', 'No', 'Indians', 'who', 'am', 'kidding', 'Every', 'episode', 'great', 'Season', '2', 'may', 'see', 'side', 'Matt', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'there', 'gun-slinger', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'touched', 'law', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'answer', 'Matt', 'man', 'man', 'Amanda', 'Blake', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'outfits', 'will', 'knock', 'eyes', 'out', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'best', 'performance', 'yet', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'shines', 'when', 'accused', 'murder', 'course', 'James', 'Arness', 'giving', 'whole', 'new', 'outlook', 'Western', 'genre', 'bringing', 'brand', 'new', 'meaning', 'concept', 'Rough', 'Justice.Last', 'Ranger']",N/A

And, the whole time I was growing up, I used to wish so bad that we could own the shows that were our personal favorites, and watch them when it was more convenient, or just when the mood struck. 30 odd years later, and here we are, doing that very thing. Never did I think I would complain about the prospect of planting my butt in my favorite chair and watching an episode or two of some of my all-time favorite shows at my own convenience. That's one of the very things I had always hoped progress would allow us to do someday. But do you know what? As much as I love being able to do that, there's something that I really, really hate!

Only a real creep would do something like that.

1107475,ANUJUFRP6RNA2,B000W8OM68,O'Dryden,"[0, 0]","This season continues to depict the dark side of human nature and the unpredictability of life in the most honest manner I have ever seen on television. Matt Dillon, Chester Goode, Kitty Russell, and Doc Adams form a tight circle of friendship and battle against those who refuse to obey the laws of Dodge and not adhere to basic laws of decency. The brutality and depravity of human nature is on full display. For example, a group of white bandits parades about the plains killing innocent farm families; Marshall Dillon accidentally shoots on of his best friends; innocent wives and husbands are killed by murderers;  a woman set on revenge purposely exposes another boy to cholera; and white settlers captured by Indians. Many of the episodes do not contain the traditional ""feel good"" endings, which I like because I think it adds to the shows intensity. Most importantly, Marshall Dillon, who is portrayed as a larger then life character, also exhibits weaknesses, doubts, and emotions like all of us. He is not perfect but you know he is doing his best to perform the almost impossible task of trying to maintain law and order on the wild frontier.Season 2 climbed in the TV ratings to number 8. James Arness was nominated for Best Continuing Performance by an Actor in a Dramatic Series. This series is the best TV show I own and I thoroughly enjoy watching it with my kids. My biggest problem is that my 13 year old son and 11 year old daughter want to watch all the episodes right away. I need to limit the viewing so that we can get at least a months worth of enjoyment out of it.If you don't like paying the high price for half a season, you can wait until season 3 arrives because like other companies, I think Paramount will package season 2 Vol 1 and Vol 2 into one set and reduce the price to around $[...]. This is what other companies are doing. The risk you run is not having the set available because it is sold out.

1107482,A1D50XFXDM24A1,B000W8OM68,Samuel E. Spear,"[14, 20]","""Gunsmoke"" began to truly hit its stride during its second season and the twenty episodes that comprise the first half of that season include several that are among the series' finest entries.  Almost all were based upon the most popular episodes of the classic radio series and the installation of Norman MacDonnell as permanent producer for the television version ensured that these episodes would remain faithful to the darker and more ""adult"" portrayal of the American West that Mr. MacDonnell and writer John Meston had brought to the radio series.  In addition, James Arness, Dennis Weaver, Amanda Blake, and Milburn Stone had established the traits of their respective characters by the time production began on the second season's shows and they were all able to bring increasing depth to their performances.  Assuming that the presentation is similar to that of the Season 1 DVDs, the video and audio quality should be extraordinary.A number of reviewers have been unsparing in their criticism of CBS/Paramount for releasing Season 2 of ""Gunsmoke"" in two volumes and for asking a higher price ""per episode"" than was set for Season 1.  I agree wholeheartedly that ""multi-volume"" season sets are annoying and like most consumers I try to find the lowest price available.  However, as a longtime ""Gunsmoke"" buff, I value this one highly enough to still feel that this set will be a great value for the price.  I personally thought the price for the 39 episodes from Season 1 was so low that it was almost unrealistic.  Just a very few years ago, the only way I was able to obtain these episodes was to (eagerly) purchase the Columbia House DVDs for an average price of $3.50 per episode.  The current amazon.com price for ""Gunsmoke"" Season 2 Volume 1 works out to about $1.30 per episode and audio and video quality promise to be superior to the Columbia House DVDs.  I would also point out that footage missing from the Columbia House DVDs will likely be restored to the forthcoming set.Obviously, quite a few reviewers feel strongly that the multi-volume offering at a higher price represents unabashed profiteering.  I suppose that's a matter of perspective, but I have a hard time thinking that ""boycotting"" this set will accomplish anything other than to further convince the major media firms that ""classic"" television DVDs aren't worth the effort.  That would be a pity.UPDATE: I received my copy of ""Gunsmoke Season 2, Volume 1"" on January 12, 2008 and have viewed several episodes.  I can attest that the audio and video quality of this set is exemplary (just as we saw with ""Season 1""), and I can also attest that CBS/Paramount has continued with the practice of locating, restoring, and including some footage that was missing from several episodes included on the Columbia House DVD collection of this series.  Ironically, the back of the box includes the standard disclaimer that ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions.""  To date, I haven't noticed any instances of missing footage on either of CBS/Paramount's ""Gunsmoke"" releases.",5,A Little Perspective...,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,3077,"['Gunsmoke', 'began', 'truly', 'hit', 'stride', 'second', 'season', 'twenty', 'comprise', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'include', 'several', 'are', 'series', 'finest', 'entries', 'Almost', 'were', 'based', 'most', 'popular', 'episodes', 'classic', 'radio', 'series', 'installation', 'Norman', 'MacDonnell', 'permanent', 'producer', 'television', 'version', 'ensured', 'episodes', 'would', 'remain', 'faithful', 'darker', 'more', 'adult', 'portrayal', 'American', 'West', 'Mr.', 'MacDonnell', 'writer', 'John', 'Meston', 'had', 'brought', 'radio', 'series', 'addition', 'James', 'Arness', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Amanda', 'Blake', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'had', 'established', 'traits', 'respective', 'characters', 'time', 'production', 'began', 'second', 'season', 'shows', 'were', 'able', 'bring', 'increasing', 'depth', 'performances', 'Assuming', 'presentation', 'similar', 'Season', '1', 'DVDs', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'should', 'be', 'extraordinary.A', 'number', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'unsparing', 'criticism', 'CBS/Paramount', 'releasing', 'Season', '2', 'Gunsmoke', 'two', 'volumes', 'asking', 'higher', 'price', 'episode', 'was', 'set', 'Season', '1', 'agree', 'wholeheartedly', 'multi-volume', 'season', 'sets', 'are', 'annoying', 'most', 'consumers', 'try', 'find', 'lowest', 'price', 'available', 'However', 'longtime', 'Gunsmoke', 'buff', 'value', 'one', 'highly', 'enough', 'still', 'feel', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'value', 'price', 'personally', 'thought', 'price', '39', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'so', 'low', 'was', 'almost', 'unrealistic', 'Just', 'very', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'way', 'was', 'able', 'obtain', 'episodes', 'was', 'eagerly', 'purchase', 'Columbia', 'House', 'DVDs', 'average', 'price', '3.50', 'episode', 'current', 'amazon.com', 'price', 'Gunsmoke', 'Season', '2', 'Volume', '1', '1.30', 'episode', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'promise', 'be', 'superior', 'Columbia', 'House', 'DVDs', 'would', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'footage', 'missing', 'Columbia', 'House', 'DVDs', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'restored', 'forthcoming', 'set.Obviously', 'quite', 'few', 'reviewers', 'feel', 'strongly', 'multi-volume', 'offering', 'higher', 'price', 'unabashed', 'profiteering', 'suppose', 'matter', 'perspective', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'thinking', 'boycotting', 'set', 'will', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'other', 'further', 'convince', 'major', 'media', 'firms', 'classic', 'television', 'DVDs', 'are', ""n't"", 'effort', 'would', 'be', 'pity.UPDATE', 'received', 'copy', 'Gunsmoke', 'Season', '2', 'Volume', '1', 'January', '12', '2008', 'have', 'viewed', 'several', 'episodes', 'can', 'attest', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'set', 'exemplary', 'just', 'saw', 'Season', '1', 'can', 'also', 'attest', 'CBS/Paramount', 'continued', 'practice', 'locating', 'restoring', 'including', 'footage', 'was', 'missing', 'several', 'episodes', 'included', 'Columbia', 'House', 'DVD', 'collection', 'series', 'Ironically', 'back', 'box', 'standard', 'disclaimer', 'episodes', 'may', 'be', 'edited', 'original', 'network', 'versions', 'date', 'have', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'instances', 'missing', 'footage', 'CBS/Paramount', 'Gunsmoke']",N/A
