1076965,AK2FSJJ7GAN8B,B000QUCQV0,"Nancy C. De Young ""darthmader""","[0, 0]","Jenna Redgrave is fantastic in her role of unusual female Dr in Victorian England. Father also a Dr but her sex keeps her out of the Old Boy club and she opens The Thrift in a run down area to help the poor. Issues cover the harshness of times...babies sent off to workhouse for a terrible cold mean childhood, women dying in childbirth...her own Mum died giving her birth..pre-antibiotic infections...pneumonia killed many patients. Being wealthy was not protection from illness and death...her benefactrice succumbs to ruptured appendix due to arrogance and incompetence of famed Dr.The costumes, medical equipment and situations are realistic...times were hard and illness was rampant.
