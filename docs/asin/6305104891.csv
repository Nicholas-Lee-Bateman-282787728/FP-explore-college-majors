At that time I bought all the wutang collection on vhs, it was fun watching them during summertime when I skipped college classes to go home & watch them & had late lunches with it while watching , then I took a nap when the shows over.  After the nap I would watch another or I save it for dinner time.I like the beginning of this movie (Taiseng Version) & past fast forward to the part with the Shaolin Palm Fist to kill the evil white haired guy.Not the best kung fu movie but for an old school kung fu flick its pretty good.Whats the difference in the dvd names, both are 1:33:1 & 90 minutes long so whats missing or which one has better picture quality over the other ?",5,whats the difference on both versions of the dvd ?,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,946,"['saw', 'Wu', 'Tang', 'Clan', 'Heroes', 'taiseng', 'video', 'version', 'time', 'dvd', 'era', 'was', 'fairly', 'new', 'have', 'vhs', 'had', '2', 'high', 'quality', 'vhs', 'recorders', 'can', 'make', '2', 'hour', 'preview', 'cool', 'old', 'school', 'fight', 'scenes', 'form', 'movies', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'bought', 'wutang', 'collection', 'vhs', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'summertime', 'when', 'skipped', 'college', 'classes', 'go', 'home', 'watch', 'had', 'late', 'lunches', 'watching', 'then', 'took', 'nap', 'when', 'shows', 'nap', 'would', 'watch', 'save', 'dinner', 'time.I', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Taiseng', 'Version', 'past', 'fast', 'forward', 'part', 'Shaolin', 'Palm', 'Fist', 'kill', 'evil', 'white', 'haired', 'guy.Not', 'best', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'old', 'school', 'kung', 'fu', 'flick', 'pretty', 'good.Whats', 'difference', 'dvd', 'names', 'are', '1:33:1', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'so', 'whats', 'missing', 'one', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'other']",Wu Tang Clan VHS

This movie is some what suspect due to the few noticable editing mix ups, but if  you really look at what's goin on in the movie you'll be very impressed. Ti  Lung is amazing in this film.  playing the role of the bad guy/good guy/  who know's for sure.  follow him as he helps bring down the shaolin temple  that he studied from, working for the ching dynasty.  Instead of killing  all the students left alive he holds them prisoners, and tortures them.  Unwilling and unknowing the prisoners are being tortured in such a way that  there Martial arts is vastly improved.  But when they finally find out what  the purpose of there arrest, it's too late for someone. Ti lung is supurb  with his shaolin palm fist, and his concealed palm, which looks smooth and  deadly as he shows them off during the climactic battle which seems to pull  the complex story together. Forget what these other reviewers are saying,  and take a look at wu tang clan, you'll thank me.",4,"See past the choppy filming, and see a classic.",964915200,"07 30, 2000",2000,1106,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'people', 'reviewing', 'were', 'watching', 'when', 'got', 'ideas', 'movie', 'were', 'well', 'truth', 'movie', 'what', 'suspect', 'due', 'few', 'noticable', 'editing', 'mix', 'ups', 'really', 'look', 'what', 'goin', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'impressed', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'amazing', 'film', 'playing', 'role', 'bad', 'guy/good', 'guy/', 'who', 'know', 'sure', 'follow', 'bring', 'down', 'shaolin', 'temple', 'studied', 'working', 'ching', 'dynasty', 'Instead', 'killing', 'students', 'left', 'alive', 'prisoners', 'Unwilling', 'unknowing', 'prisoners', 'are', 'being', 'tortured', 'such', 'way', 'Martial', 'arts', 'vastly', 'improved', 'when', 'finally', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'purpose', 'arrest', 'too', 'late', 'someone', 'Ti', 'lung', 'supurb', 'shaolin', 'palm', 'fist', 'concealed', 'palm', 'smooth', 'deadly', 'off', 'climactic', 'battle', 'pull', 'complex', 'story', 'together', 'Forget', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'saying', 'take', 'look', 'wu', 'tang', 'clan', ""'ll"", 'thank']",Wu Tang Clan VHS
448437,ACQXZS0F9JSXL,6305104891,Joe Fatmama,"[4, 6]","A wonderful HK classic with plenty of well choreographed fights, and even a meningful plot (well, by HK standards).  The story follows a former Shaolin student, turned Ching -- Marshall Kao, who is forced to eradicate the very temple that once harbored him, and thus to betray his own btothers, who are initilally incredulous of Kao's new allegiance.  Torn between his loyalty and his friends who have all but turned against him, Kao forges a plan to redeem himself and pays the ultimate price upon its completion.The reason for a 3 star rating is the horrendous image quality on this DVD.  I do not recall the VHS being this bad, it simply looks out of focus most of the time -- a real f%^*ing disgrace.  Definitely recommend the movie, but do bring your prescription glasses as not to be completely baffled by the impressionistic DVD transfer.",3,"classic martial arts flick, dreadful quality",1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,845,"['wonderful', 'HK', 'classic', 'plenty', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fights', 'even', 'meningful', 'plot', 'well', 'HK', 'standards', 'story', 'former', 'Shaolin', 'student', 'turned', 'Ching', 'Marshall', 'Kao', 'who', 'forced', 'eradicate', 'very', 'temple', 'once', 'harbored', 'thus', 'betray', 'own', 'btothers', 'who', 'are', 'initilally', 'incredulous', 'Kao', 'new', 'allegiance', 'Torn', 'loyalty', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'turned', 'Kao', 'plan', 'redeem', 'ultimate', 'price', 'completion.The', 'reason', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'horrendous', 'image', 'quality', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'recall', 'VHS', 'being', 'bad', 'simply', 'focus', 'most', 'time', 'real', 'f', '%', '^*ing', 'disgrace', 'Definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'do', 'bring', 'prescription', 'glasses', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'baffled', 'impressionistic', 'DVD', 'transfer']",Wu Tang Clan VHS
448438,APIW11UEPKIC2,6305104891,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[1, 1]","Ti Lung plays a traitor of the Shaolin temple.  He is a General working for the Chings.  Dorian Tan, Choi Wang and Wu Ma play students of Shaolin, and are captured after the temple is destroyed.  They are repeatedly tortured by Ti Lung.  Chan Wai Man plays the high government official, and he suspects something is up.  Ti Lung is not only torturing his former friends, but he is actually training them to become stronger so they can overthrow the Ching dynasty.  As you can probably guess, the movie ends with a duel between Chan Wai Man and Ti Lung.I was not blown away by this movie, but that is probably because I have seen so many kung fu movies and this just didn't offer anything new to me.  And it doesn't help that it is a very low budget movie.  I did get a surprise at the end, so it gets bonus points for that.  And I have to point out how great of an actor Ti Lung is.  It doesn't matter how cheap the movie is, Ti Lung is always the man.The fighting is a bit slow, but the choreography by Robert Tai is still pretty good.  Ti Lung is smooth as can be with his movements, Dorian Tan's kicks look great, and the final fight is definitely worth waiting for.3/5Picture quality is decent.  Looks the same as all of Tai Seng's other Martial Arts Theater releases.  The English dub sounds fine.  There is a commentary from Ric Meyers.  He basically just reads off filmographies.",3,This review is for the Tai Seng DVD of 'The Heroes' from 1980,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,1386,"['Ti', 'Lung', 'traitor', 'Shaolin', 'temple', 'General', 'working', 'Chings', 'Dorian', 'Tan', 'Choi', 'Wang', 'Wu', 'Ma', 'play', 'students', 'Shaolin', 'are', 'captured', 'temple', 'destroyed', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'tortured', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'Chan', 'Wai', 'Man', 'high', 'government', 'official', 'something', 'up', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'not', 'only', 'torturing', 'former', 'friends', 'actually', 'training', 'become', 'stronger', 'can', 'overthrow', 'Ching', 'dynasty', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'movie', 'duel', 'Chan', 'Wai', 'Man', 'Ti', 'Lung.I', 'was', 'not', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'probably', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'new', ""n't"", 'help', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'did', 'get', 'surprise', 'end', 'bonus', 'points', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'great', 'actor', 'Ti', 'Lung', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'cheap', 'movie', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'always', 'man.The', 'fighting', 'bit', 'slow', 'choreography', 'Robert', 'Tai', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'smooth', 'can', 'be', 'movements', 'Dorian', 'Tan', 'kicks', 'look', 'great', 'final', 'fight', 'definitely', 'worth', 'waiting', 'for.3/5Picture', 'quality', 'decent', 'same', 'Tai', 'Seng', 'other', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'Theater', 'English', 'dub', 'fine', 'commentary', 'Ric', 'Meyers', 'basically', 'just', 'reads', 'off', 'filmographies']",Wu Tang Clan VHS
