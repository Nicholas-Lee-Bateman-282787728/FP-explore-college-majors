1427187,A1ITCVZ46MUB3A,B004SGWYVA,A Hot Whizzer Summer...,"[2, 3]","High School of the dead is a little bit of a misleading name, as the majority of the series doesn't actually take place in a high school, albeit most of the characters are related to the high school in one fashion or another.This is your basic zombie apocalypse story delivered as anime. It consists of all the things you expect from this kind of story, gore, blood, human interaction, mental breakdowns, and nudity. In all reality, HOTD has a lot less nudity than some anime I have watched in recent months, only consisting of a single episodes with anything of the sort. The fan service instead relies on women with abnormally large and giggly chests more than openly graphic nudity.HOTD provides less flat out humor than you might expect from most ""funny"" anime. However, it provides jokes in a much more subtle way that still let's you enjoy yourself. For example, in one scene, a character decides to use a girl's breasts to stabilize his machine gun as he fired it.I really liked some of the characterization in this anime. People aren't quite as idiotically stupid as they appear in other zombie films, and will often say what you might expect them to. I particularly like the smart girl with glasses, as she quickly manages to reason out what is going on instead of rambling around for 3 episodes saying... ""Oh is that what is going on?"" like is produced in many Hollywood movies.This is not a horror anime, and I can't say I was scared for a single moment. The main characters seem relatively invincible so far as they work together to blast through one zombie infestation after another. Three of the characters, specifically, seem to be able to beat and hit their way through any amount of zombies without a second thought, giving you very little sense of danger. If you try to see this as some kind of horror flick with building dread and suspense, you will be be disappointed. If you see this as some fun zombie killing good time guilty pleasure like Zombieland or Left 4 Dead, then sit back and enjoy yourself, as this anime can be very enjoyable.One last thing, this is not the full series. This is merely the first season of a potentially multi season show. It does not end in a cliffhanger, but it doesn't really end complete either, as there are tons of unanswered questions left by the end, most of all being how are they going to survive? The next series is said to start soon and I eagerly await for it's release as well.To sum it up, this is a good fun watch but there is very little substance here. It's a zombie smashing, boob swinging, good time and not much else. I give it a 4 star because within one season there is very little progression storywise, but is otherwise a fun watch.",4,I enjoyed it alot,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,2707,"['High', 'School', 'dead', 'little', 'bit', 'misleading', 'name', 'majority', 'series', ""n't"", 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'high', 'school', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'related', 'high', 'school', 'one', 'fashion', 'another.This', 'basic', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'story', 'delivered', 'anime', 'things', 'expect', 'kind', 'story', 'gore', 'blood', 'human', 'interaction', 'mental', 'breakdowns', 'nudity', 'reality', 'HOTD', 'lot', 'less', 'nudity', 'anime', 'have', 'watched', 'recent', 'months', 'only', 'consisting', 'single', 'episodes', 'anything', 'sort', 'fan', 'service', 'instead', 'women', 'abnormally', 'large', 'giggly', 'more', 'openly', 'graphic', 'nudity.HOTD', 'less', 'flat', 'humor', 'might', 'expect', 'most', 'funny', 'anime', 'However', 'jokes', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'way', 'still', 'let', 'enjoy', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'character', 'use', 'girl', 'breasts', 'stabilize', 'machine', 'gun', 'fired', 'it.I', 'really', 'liked', 'characterization', 'anime', 'People', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'idiotically', 'stupid', 'appear', 'other', 'zombie', 'films', 'will', 'often', 'say', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'particularly', 'smart', 'girl', 'glasses', 'quickly', 'reason', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'instead', 'rambling', '3', 'episodes', 'saying', 'Oh', 'what', 'going', 'produced', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'movies.This', 'not', 'horror', 'anime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'scared', 'single', 'moment', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'relatively', 'invincible', 'so', 'far', 'work', 'together', 'blast', 'one', 'zombie', 'infestation', 'Three', 'characters', 'specifically', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'beat', 'hit', 'way', 'amount', 'zombies', 'second', 'thought', 'giving', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'danger', 'try', 'see', 'kind', 'horror', 'flick', 'building', 'dread', 'suspense', 'will', 'be', 'be', 'disappointed', 'see', 'fun', 'killing', 'good', 'time', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Zombieland', 'Left', '4', 'Dead', 'then', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'anime', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable.One', 'last', 'thing', 'not', 'full', 'series', 'merely', 'first', 'season', 'potentially', 'multi', 'season', 'show', 'not', 'end', 'cliffhanger', ""n't"", 'really', 'end', 'complete', 'either', 'are', 'tons', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'left', 'end', 'most', 'being', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'survive', 'next', 'series', 'said', 'start', 'soon', 'eagerly', 'await', 'release', 'well.To', 'sum', 'up', 'good', 'fun', 'watch', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'here', 'zombie', 'smashing', 'boob', 'swinging', 'good', 'time', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'give', '4', 'star', 'one', 'season', 'very', 'little', 'progression', 'storywise', 'otherwise', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A

This is a short series, and they oddly enough stamped it forty dollars? No way. The show is entertaining to watch on a rainy day, if you don't have anything better to watch. But, to spend that much on 12 episodes of a show with virtually NO story whatsoever and nothing but fanservice is like paying for a prostitute to stare at.Cliches out the ass. Every character has huge breasts and a butt that could be considered a rear bust. We get every sort of overused carbon copy stereotype that we can. Moe, super moe, super tsundere, loli, fat nerd otaku, the overly regular guy who turns out to be a badass, military chick and so on. It's nothing to write home about. The animation is decent, but it seems they put the most budget and effort into shading the female assets when they're constantly jamming them down your throat. Call me gay for saying there's too much fanservice... but there really is.I can't bash it for not having a story, since it's a zombie plot. Government shadiness, people dying, moral crisis, loss of innocence, it's all rather typical. So they don't gain points but they don't lose many either. Though you can call them unoriginal and dock points if you're critical like me.There's a carefree negligence the show makes blatantly obvious almost every scene. They all know that they could easily die and be doomed at any moment, but... nobody seems to care. I understand losing the will to live during the apocalypse, but they just blindly run into hordes of zombies like ""LOLOL I HOPE I DUN GET BIT! DERP! CLOSE RANGE IS SMART WITH FLESH EATING INFECTED!"" and it sort of pisses me off. Sure- it makes things 'fun' but at the same time makes it just lack just a bit more logic (though I know mentioning logic in a series about zombies is retarded).So- overall... if you want a new reason to look up images of certain characters and desire a blond haired nurse character who has breasts that might hit the floor if she were topless, look up High School of the Dead. It's not an amazing series, but there's a bit of fun bloodbrawling that makes you smirk and some nice bums and bewbs forced into every other scene. It's amazingly overpriced and I can only imagine that all the females have the most disgusting dubs ever- but give it a shot if you need something to keep you awake for a few hours.",3,Not worth it.,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,2413,"['watched', 'HOTD', 'Japanese-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'dub', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'yet', 'short', 'series', 'oddly', 'enough', 'stamped', 'dollars', 'way', 'show', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'rainy', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'better', 'watch', 'spend', 'that', 'much', '12', 'episodes', 'show', 'virtually', 'NO', 'story', 'whatsoever', 'nothing', 'fanservice', 'paying', 'prostitute', 'stare', 'at.Cliches', 'out', 'ass', 'character', 'huge', 'breasts', 'butt', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'rear', 'bust', 'get', 'sort', 'overused', 'carbon', 'copy', 'stereotype', 'can', 'Moe', 'super', 'moe', 'super', 'tsundere', 'loli', 'fat', 'nerd', 'otaku', 'overly', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'badass', 'military', 'chick', 'so', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'animation', 'decent', 'put', 'most', 'budget', 'effort', 'shading', 'female', 'assets', 'when', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'jamming', 'down', 'throat', 'Call', 'gay', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'fanservice', 'really', 'is.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bash', 'not', 'having', 'story', 'zombie', 'plot', 'Government', 'shadiness', 'people', 'dying', 'moral', 'crisis', 'loss', 'innocence', 'rather', 'typical', 'do', ""n't"", 'gain', 'points', 'do', ""n't"", 'lose', 'many', 'can', 'call', 'unoriginal', 'dock', 'points', ""'re"", 'critical', 'carefree', 'negligence', 'show', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'almost', 'scene', 'know', 'could', 'easily', 'die', 'be', 'doomed', 'moment', 'nobody', 'care', 'understand', 'losing', 'will', 'live', 'apocalypse', 'just', 'blindly', 'run', 'hordes', 'zombies', 'LOLOL', 'HOPE', 'DUN', 'GET', 'BIT', 'DERP', 'CLOSE', 'RANGE', 'IS', 'SMART', 'WITH', 'FLESH', 'EATING', 'INFECTED', 'sort', 'pisses', 'off', 'Sure-', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'just', 'lack', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'logic', 'know', 'mentioning', 'logic', 'series', 'zombies', 'retarded', '.So-', 'overall', 'want', 'new', 'reason', 'look', 'up', 'images', 'certain', 'characters', 'desire', 'blond', 'haired', 'nurse', 'character', 'who', 'breasts', 'might', 'hit', 'floor', 'were', 'topless', 'look', 'up', 'High', 'School', 'Dead', 'not', 'amazing', 'series', 'bit', 'fun', 'bloodbrawling', 'smirk', 'nice', 'bums', 'bewbs', 'forced', 'other', 'scene', 'amazingly', 'overpriced', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'females', 'have', 'most', 'disgusting', 'dubs', 'ever-', 'give', 'shot', 'need', 'something', 'keep', 'awake', 'few', 'hours']",N/A

The only bad thing about this anime is that it's far too short, but has an excellent pace and decent action...as well as comedy thrown in here and there.It's paint-by-the-numbers as far as the plot goes:  A zombie shows up and bites someone and suddenly there's a whole horde of Zombies that wants nothing but to eat the flesh of the living. The survivors band together to fight off the zombies with various weapons....the plot is not that original besides the fact that this takes place at a school instead of a mall.

There are those who cannot stand boobs, those who love boobs, and those who actually watched the series and discovered a great anime.  I am with the last group.  For me great series come down to two things: an interesting story and character development; and HotD has that.  I agree that fan service can be over the top sometimes, but if you are intelligent enough to look beyond the boobs, you will find a great series with potential for greatness.  I will spare you from the details of the story because I do not want to spoil it.If you are hesitant about buying this series because it is only part of a larger story (this is a manga adaption), I will not be worried because this first 12 episodes are self contained and can stand as complete series with a beginning and conclusion.

1427194,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B004SGWYVA,Arch Stanton,"[22, 62]","Fan Service and zombies. That's all this show is. So I suppose that any review has to cover both of them. Ladies first I guess.The opening titles alone has a dozen crotch and boob shots. None of them serve any purpose. Throughout the show you are constantly plastered with this given the slightest opportunity. Or even when they have to create an opportunity. The number of dialogue scenes where the camera slowly goes down to focus on their panties averages out to at least two an episode. Probably more. The worst episode by far is episode six. In it the girls all bathe together, with predictable fondling and lesbianism, while the two guys sit in the other room and talk about guns. That's the whole episode right there. Oh, except for the fact that all the girls try to sleep with the main guy. I'm assuming that they got drunk somewhere in there because they all act it after the bath. Either it's just assumed or that's just how this guy thinks girls act when they let their crazy feminine emotions out.This is symptomatic of the treatment of the girls in general throughout the series. All of the girls (with one exception) offer nothing but an opportunity to show off their bodies. There are four main girls. I can't be bothered to remember their names so I'll just identify them by their hair color. Pink is a total b*tch. She says she's a genius at every possible opportunity although she never demonstrates any proof of it (many of her 'facts' are wrong and the ones that are right she cannot possibly know), and she enjoys belittling people for it. The blonde girl is a complete bimbo. She's the school nurse but she has giant breasts and the IQ of a five year old. She never speaks except to whine or fawn all over the main character who is I might point out, actually an underage student. I suspect she works at a high school for a very specific reason... Brown hair is also obnoxious and likes to go on about how great the guy's friend was even though he's still traumatized from killing him. At one point she's thrown from a car and she just lies there for at least 3-4 hours (it goes from midday to sunset) while everyone else protects her. She's not hurt or anything, she just gets up and walks it off. Naturally she's the main love interest. The last girl is purple haired and she's the only semi-good one. She's a master with swords and genuinely loves killing zombies. Her competence and professionalism do not prevent her from being used as yet another sex doll for them to display. It is made quite clear that even the competent girl can do nothing without a guy to lead her. More than that the girls cannot think for themselves and constantly put everyone's lives in danger because of their uncontrolled emotions and lusts. It really is a disgustingly misogynistic and exploitative show.So now the zombies. Zombies are cool right? How can they mess them up? Well first off they never call them zombies. They seem to think this makes them realistic somehow. Secondly they bind them with stupid rules and then constantly break them. These zombies are cannot see, smell or touch. The only sense they have is hearing. Sounds interesting right? So naturally they'll be quiet and sneak around to prevent the zombies from hearing them. Except they don't. They run around screaming with zombies all around ignoring them and then one of them will bump into a pole, or drop a bat, or the wind in the trees will make noise and suddenly the zombies are attacking them everywhere. I want you to think hard about that last one. The wind in the trees attracted the zombies. THE WIND IN THE FRIGGIN' TREES!!!!!! So having established by the second episode that zombies need sound to hunt they then proceed to ignore it until it is convenient to the show for them to be in danger. How can there be any actual sense of danger when they ignore their own rules when it's convenient?The two guys are there too. That's really all that can be said of them. The main guy is basically how the author views the perfect guy to be. He has no real flaws and is fawned over to an obscene degree by all the women. The other guy is a fat nerd and a gun buff. He's probably the most interesting character there since he's extremely competent at one thing and enjoys it immensely. Naturally he's treated with nothing but contempt by all the girls who are nothing if not superficial.So, the good things.........I'm drawing a blank here. I suppose that technically it's an impressive film. The animation is quite good and the character designs aren't that bad. The main theme's pretty catchy too. Apart from that zip. Zilch. Nada.

1427213,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B004SGWYVA,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[10, 39]","I've heard a lot of things about High School of the Dead, but mostly how it's a combination of zombie horror and anime fan service. I wasn't really expecting anything good since a few respectable anime fans confirmed that I'd hate it, but out of morbid curiosity and the fact that I was able to watch this for free, I spend a day watching it and holy moly, this is among the worst of the worst in anime.I loathe this so badly, I now consider it the second worst anime I've ever seen, right behind Elfen Lied.STORYHigh School of the Dead focuses on a group of teenagers in a high school that soon find themselves in the middle of a zombie outbreak in Japan. They must band together to survive and possibly even find the truth behind the zombie outbreak.TONAL INCONSISTENCYThis is one of the most tonally-inconsistent anime titles I've ever seen in my life. The tonal inconsistency is the biggest ""death sentence"" for this anime. There's so many scenes in this anime that switch tones and visual styles at the drop of a hat. At one moment, you'll see really gruesome killings at the hands of zombies and right afterward, you'll see dumb, over-exaggerated faces, nosebleed gags, and way too much ecchi comedy. It's like the writers that created this anime couldn't decide between making a zombie series or a high school teenage dramedy, so they took the worst route imaginable and mashed the two together, and they mesh about as well as two ferocious streetdogs fighting for dumpster scraps.I swear it's almost like the people who wrote this anime were trying to outdo Elfen Lied in terms of horrible tonal shifts. Among the worst examples of the bad tonal shifts is the episode where all the female characters bathe together and aren't the least bit hesitant to grab each others' unmentionables and spraying each other with shower heads. Aside from this not being sensually appealing or funny, it's followed by a man and his daughter trying to hide from the zombies, and the dad gets killed, followed with the girl crying over her dad's dead body. Another example of odd tonal shifts is that the nurse has a brief fantasy of herself as a maid cleaning her friend's apartment, which doesn't fit in with the fact that there's zombies all over the place, killing people. Even worse is that there cartoon-ish ""bouncing"" sound effects and other sound effects that are more appropriate for a Looney Tunes short than a ""mature"" anime centered around a zombie outbreak. The tonal shifts and changes in serious to silly visual styles harmed this anime so badly, that I was totally unengaged by anything else and was just waiting out until the end.CHARACTERSThere was no creativity in the way the characters were made. None of them have much nuance beyond the most base stereotypes, and this makes them unlikeable and especially uninteresting. Among the worst characters in this anime is the nurse (characters are forgettable to the point of not remembering names). She's dumber than a coffee can full of nails and whines a lot about everything, yet the students take her with, despite the fact that's she's practically nothing but dead weight. This shows that this anime is without much logic, either, as the nurse is beyond stupid yet is somehow holding a job healing minor ailments that befall students at school. Another among the worst stereotypes is the chubby geek (I think his name is Kota), as he represents all the worst stereotypes of ostracized kids due to his unhealthy fixation on guns and his choice to wear black clothing. Easily among the most annoying characters is the pink-haired one, since she has an ego bigger than Kanye West's (she's always claiming to be a genius) yet proves to be useless in 99% of the anime, and is further damaged for the fact that she's just a cookie-cutter caricature of over-achieving honor students (uptight, belittling others, and constantly harping over her intellectual prowess).PRETENTIOUSNESSAside from the fact that this anime is rampant with bad tonal shifts, it also doesn't help that in terms of its themes and overall story, it wants to have its cake and eat it, too. So much of the time is spent in this anime trying to be a constant vehicle for fanservice to appeal to teenage male anime fans, yet there's hints of it trying to be higher than what it is as it also tries to make commentary about whether or not the real monsters are the humans or zombies (highlighted by the hysterical school teacher who tries to form a cult with some of the surviving students). Instead of adding depth to the anime, it just feels like tacked-on social commentary thrown in there to make this anime seem smarter than it really is.This anime goes even further into pretentious territory where there's a segment that tries to tie in the storyline of this anime with Mutiny on the Bounty. This scene didn't make the anime anymore ""artistically-developed,"" but just trying too hard to be more than something stupid.LACK OF ORIGINALITYOne of the things that struck me the most about High School of the Dead is that it's nothing but a salad bowl of all the most base cliches from the anime genre.Lots of jejune violence? Check.Majority of female characters are schoolgirls? Check.Unimaginative character personalities? Check.Lots of unfunny ecchi comedy? Check.Half-baked storyline? Check.Lots of redundant fanservice? Double check.Half-baked ending? Check.It's apparent that none of the people who made this anime wanted to make something that was a labor of love or to add anything of artistic merit to the anime genre. They just looked at all the most lucrative aspects to anime and mashed them together.ACTION SCENESWith this being an anime that's supposed to be heavy on zombie-slaying action, this didn't deliver at all. Despite the plentiful action scenes, the absolute dearth of quality character development or character personalities stripped away all tension in these scenes. The way these scenes are made are so predictable, as there's plenty of scenes where you think one of the main characters is going to get eaten by the zombies, there's a ""deus ex machina"" moment where the zombie(s) in question get slain before they can infect one of the main characters. I should have kept count when these scenes occurred, but there's more than enough to take away any tension. Not that this would have helped out a lot since the clashing tones damage this anime beyond repair, but it would have helped if the writers were more creative and had one or two of the main characters die off. I should also point out how absurd some of the action scenes are, since there's a scene where one of the guys runs out of ammo during a fight with the zombies and grabs the brown-haired girl's gun, but because of the strap attached to her, he has to push her down and sandwich his arms between her chest. Does there really need to be this much blatant fanservice? I rolled my eyes at least twice when this occurred.BAD HUMORNow you must be saying ""Can't you just get over yourself and enjoy the action and ecchi humor for what it is?"" I answer with a gigantic ""NO!"" The humor in this totally lacks creativity, since these types of ecchi jokes have been repeated ad nauseum in previous anime, and they don't do any good (especially for folks like me, who have a giant disdain for anime comedy as it is). If I wanted humor, I'll go watch some Angry Grandpa videos or Dumb and Dumber. Speaking of that, I swear there was a gag that was ripped off from that hilarious movie. There's a scene where the group leader saves a little girl from the zombies and is carrying her on his back, and she has to go to the bathroom, and because she couldn't hold it in, she wets herself and the guy's back. That scene was funny in Dumb and Dumber, but not in this.APPEARANCEThe animation and artwork certainly had a lot of time and effort put into it, but good visuals alone NEVER make a worthwhile anime. Despite being a huge technical achievement, this is easily Madhouse's worst creation thus far. To think the same studio that cranked out Perfect Blue and Battle Angel also made this.SOUNDTRACKThe background music in this anime was pretty forgettable, and the music in the intro wasn't any good. It's just pop-rock that doesn't fit at all with an anime centered around an apocalyptic zombie attack.MATURE CONTENTThere's a great deal of gore in this anime. There's plenty of bloodshed and of people getting eaten by zombies, and even some dismemberment. The nudity and sensual content isn't at all extreme for me, since there weren't any female parts totally exposed, as the animators were chickens and conveniently covered up any private areas, in which the scenes are as absurd as the comedic censoring in the Austin Powers movies.Since there's so many scenes with fanservice and absurd female behavior, this anime totally reeks of misogyny (no points were added or deducted for allegations of misogyny, these are merely observations), yet I'd bet a dozen Snickers bars that the anime fans gushing over High School of the Dead would quickly smash Doomed Megalopolis for allegations of misogynistic content.FINAL WORDIf you're looking for Japanese animation to feed into your most personal fantasies of women, man up and get some Bible Black DVDs instead (or watch BB on the internet). Bible Black goes all the way with its ""mature content"" and as a whole, is much more enjoyable than HOTD since even though its animated erotica, it still manages to maintain a pretty serious, consistent tone and with semi-competent story and character development.If you want adult anime containing artistic merit, check these titles out instead.Shigurui: Death FrenzyRin: Daughters of

I recieved it yesterday and watched the entire season in one sitting (with a break to walk the dog). Afterwards I have to say, WHERE IS SEASON 2!! This was a great series. It truly developed the characters and you started liking/disliking them because of their traits. Yes it is anime, but it tackled the idea of zombie apocalypse quite ""realistically"" (so to speak) in the terms of how it would spread and how society would change in a heartbeat. Do you only look out for yourself or do you put your neck on the line to save a stranger from death? Would you kill the weaker, to ensure your own survival? Are you capable of killing or has it been something deeply woven into you that you feared what would happen if it came out?None of the characters are exactly alike. Some of them are just there for laughs(Nurse Megamammory) who even responds to the question of why she's so ditzy by stating it's how she was written. It doesn't take itself so seriously, there are laugh out loud moments, and OMG REALLY!?!?!?! moments. The combat is great, voice acting was remarkable given some of the horrible voice overs lately.The one thing that I wanted to do though was beat them for always yelling, its like HELLO ZOMBIES CAN HEAR YOU, SHUT UP lol. Super glad I bought this series as it is one to watch several times over. Zombie destruction day marathons FTW!I truly hope they come out with a season 2 because this is one series to follow. I fear like most of the anime I end up loving it will be a one season wonder to only be lived out in the imagination of it's true fans.",5,"Expected little, was amazed in the end",1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,1655,"['was', 'skeptic', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'show', 'had', 'decent', 'things', 'say', 'recieved', 'yesterday', 'watched', 'entire', 'season', 'one', 'sitting', 'break', 'walk', 'dog', 'Afterwards', 'have', 'say', 'WHERE', 'IS', 'SEASON', '2', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'truly', 'developed', 'characters', 'started', 'liking/disliking', 'traits', 'Yes', 'anime', 'tackled', 'idea', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'quite', 'realistically', 'so', 'speak', 'terms', 'how', 'would', 'spread', 'how', 'society', 'would', 'change', 'heartbeat', 'Do', 'only', 'look', 'out', 'do', 'put', 'neck', 'line', 'save', 'stranger', 'death', 'Would', 'kill', 'weaker', 'ensure', 'own', 'survival', 'Are', 'capable', 'killing', 'been', 'something', 'deeply', 'woven', 'feared', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'came', 'out', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'exactly', 'alike', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'laughs', 'Nurse', 'Megamammory', 'who', 'even', 'question', 'why', 'so', 'ditzy', 'stating', 'how', 'was', 'written', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'seriously', 'are', 'loud', 'moments', 'OMG', 'REALLY', 'moments', 'combat', 'great', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'remarkable', 'given', 'horrible', 'voice', 'overs', 'lately.The', 'one', 'thing', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'beat', 'always', 'yelling', 'HELLO', 'ZOMBIES', 'CAN', 'HEAR', 'YOU', 'SHUT', 'UP', 'lol', 'Super', 'glad', 'bought', 'series', 'one', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'Zombie', 'destruction', 'day', 'marathons', 'FTW', 'truly', 'hope', 'come', 'out', 'season', '2', 'one', 'series', 'follow', 'fear', 'most', 'anime', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'season', 'wonder', 'only', 'be', 'lived', 'out', 'imagination', 'true', 'fans']",N/A
1427217,A2BESHHTTDGI2Y,B004SGWYVA,EZE,"[1, 2]","I've known about the High School of the Dead Manga since I was in High School.  I never read it though other than a quick summary of the story.  I thought it sounded interesting but I never followed up on it.  Just a few months ago I saw the entire show and was amazed at how good the story is.First off let me say that yes, the circumstances are ridiculous (2 average dudes traveling with 4 INSANELY hot babes) but isn't that every high school kids fantasy?  A zombie apocalypse where the women outnumber the men in the group and they all fight over you?  Sounds good to me.The only bad thing I have to say about this show is the amount of ""fan service"" that is displayed.  We get far too MANY shots of boobs jiggling, panty shots, and stupid situations in which boobs are somehow the focus.  If they had been more subtle with that then this show would have been perfect.In one of the episodes you have the 2 main guys in one room talking about guns and loading them up, while the 4 girls are in the bathroom bathing together and grabbing each others tits.  Then they walk around the apartment either naked, or wearing nothing but an apron while acting VERY horny and stoned trying to hit on the main character.  He of course is shocked like very other damn anime character is in these shows and denies their advances, opting to tuck them into bed so that he can go snipe out some zombies.I realize this defines a lot of male fantasies but it's done in such a blatant way that I can't help but shake my head and blush when I watch this.As far as the characters go I think they are well developed.  The main guy is your average slacker with hidden potential that most of the girls want when the shiz hits the fan.  The second dude is you typical fat geek who happens to be obsessed with guns and is an expert in their use.  He's probably the most useful character in battle.  The 4 women are: The ditsy nurse with the ENORMOUS rack.  She's the only adult in the group.  Then there's the main girl, she's basically the main love interest of the main character, she's hot, well balanced, has drama...etc.  The third girl is the red/pink headed smart rich girl of the group.  She seems to be a potential love interest for the fat gun nerd.  And finally the fourth girl is the samurai girl, who is the best hand to hand combat character in the group.  She's the most serious of all the females and is probably in competition with the main girl for the main guys man juices.The characters are fun and the show is entertaining.  A fine addition to the ever growing zombie culture.I rate this show 5 stars despite the embarrassing fan service.  If you like zombies, guns, hot anime girls, and drama then you will like this show.",5,Every High School Kids Dream,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,2721,"[""'ve"", 'known', 'High', 'School', 'Dead', 'Manga', 'was', 'High', 'School', 'never', 'read', 'other', 'quick', 'summary', 'story', 'thought', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'never', 'followed', 'up', 'Just', 'few', 'months', 'saw', 'entire', 'show', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'story', 'is.First', 'let', 'say', 'yes', 'circumstances', 'are', 'ridiculous', '2', 'average', 'dudes', 'traveling', '4', 'INSANELY', 'hot', 'babes', ""n't"", 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'fantasy', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'where', 'women', 'outnumber', 'men', 'group', 'fight', 'good', 'me.The', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'show', 'amount', 'fan', 'service', 'displayed', 'get', 'far', 'too', 'MANY', 'shots', 'boobs', 'jiggling', 'panty', 'shots', 'stupid', 'situations', 'boobs', 'are', 'somehow', 'focus', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'subtle', 'then', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect.In', 'one', 'episodes', 'have', '2', 'main', 'guys', 'one', 'room', 'talking', 'guns', 'loading', 'up', '4', 'girls', 'are', 'bathroom', 'bathing', 'together', 'grabbing', 'others', 'tits', 'Then', 'walk', 'apartment', 'naked', 'wearing', 'nothing', 'apron', 'acting', 'VERY', 'horny', 'stoned', 'trying', 'hit', 'main', 'character', 'course', 'shocked', 'very', 'other', 'damn', 'anime', 'character', 'shows', 'advances', 'opting', 'tuck', 'bed', 'can', 'go', 'snipe', 'out', 'zombies.I', 'realize', 'lot', 'male', 'fantasies', 'done', 'such', 'blatant', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'shake', 'head', 'blush', 'when', 'watch', 'this.As', 'far', 'characters', 'go', 'think', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'main', 'guy', 'average', 'slacker', 'hidden', 'potential', 'most', 'girls', 'want', 'when', 'shiz', 'fan', 'second', 'dude', 'typical', 'fat', 'geek', 'who', 'be', 'obsessed', 'guns', 'expert', 'use', 'probably', 'most', 'useful', 'character', 'battle', '4', 'women', 'are', 'ditsy', 'nurse', 'ENORMOUS', 'rack', 'only', 'adult', 'group', 'Then', 'main', 'girl', 'basically', 'main', 'love', 'interest', 'main', 'character', 'hot', 'well', 'balanced', 'drama', 'etc', 'third', 'girl', 'red/pink', 'headed', 'smart', 'rich', 'girl', 'group', 'be', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'fat', 'gun', 'nerd', 'finally', 'fourth', 'girl', 'samurai', 'girl', 'who', 'best', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'character', 'group', 'most', 'serious', 'females', 'probably', 'competition', 'main', 'girl', 'main', 'guys', 'man', 'juices.The', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'show', 'entertaining', 'fine', 'addition', 'ever', 'growing', 'zombie', 'culture.I', 'rate', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'embarrassing', 'fan', 'service', 'like', 'zombies', 'guns', 'hot', 'anime', 'girls', 'drama', 'then', 'will', 'like', 'show']",N/A

It's not complete now, and we don't know for sure that more won't be animated.The annoying part, is that the OVA was known about long ago, so either nobody did their research, the contracts were done way too early, or like many anime brought over to the US, the local producers refused to spring for the extra material licensing.I've been thinking the latter on a lot of recent releases since I keep seeing info stating 2.0 dolby on shows that were broadcast in 5.1 AC-3.  Not sure if that is the case here, though.We're watching this at our anime club, and other than the rather amazed impression the super-breast-overdose with slo-mo and bullet-dodging was, in terms of animation... most of the members (including me) thought the extreme over-the-top fanservice was annoying, unnecessary (the story and characters were plenty sufficient without it), and distracting.

Every week when it came out online we would watch it together. This anime does what happens in many shows that are in the west only with an anime feel to it this time.So the story is your typical zombie outbreak that came out of nowhere and the main characters have to band together to survive. It really is that simple.The anime only goes up to the first arc in the manga so not much is done for the first season except to establish the characters. That's fine to establish how bad the world has gone because of the zombies. At the same time though, I feel like the most serious scenes in the series were ruined by the over the top fanservice. Like I wish the anime could stay serious for a couple of minutes without the bouncing noises. Not to say that in some scenes this was hilarious (the bullet Matrix scene anyone?)

Between story, cultural elements and animation quality I'm more than willing to over look the relatively minor fan boy titillation factor, in my enjoyment of the show.Starting in a Japanese high school the series follows the adventures of survivors, mostly students, of the outbreak of a zombie apocalypse. Besides surviving the flesh eating, populous infecting cadavers the characters have to look into themselves and reflect on their roles in society as the society crumbles around them, For example do they listen to a teacher that no body liked? He is an adult and would have been an authority at school but now? This would be an interesting issue for anyone but in a culture like Japan that is so fixated on the individual knowing his or her place in society it is nearly revolutionary.The quality of the animation is very good, so much so this is definitely not for children. In the first episode you get a view of an infected but not yet turned teacher doing a header out a window onto the concrete below- splat. Very vivid. true to life, if you can use that term here, but also very disturbing.The characters a pretty much stock types to those familiar with anime, is there some rule that girls outside of ""Bamboo Blade"" who do kendo must have long hair and talk in monotones or that very smart girls must be  bitterly and unpleasantly contemptuous of everyone else? But it works. There has been much made of the `fan boy jiggle factor' and this did worry me but it isn't so bad. It is no where near as bad as anime like ""Akira"" or ""Najica"" where the angles are always up the skirts.The girls are well endowed but not over the top. There are flashes of panties but it's just that, flashes as might be expected from girls in short, school girl, skirts in active combat. Most skin seen is in a more realistic setting than gratuitous.  The exception to this is the school doctor- a brainless blond bimbo with boobs so large she needs scaffolding more than a bra and which move with the audible rumble of a kettle drum. Her I found annoying. The jiggle factor and the fact that she's dumb as a box of rocks- and she's a doctor? - was bad.The graphic violence means it is not for the kiddies but overall I really enjoyed High School Of The Dead. Well drawn and plotted with a serious creep factor for the horror and the hallmark of good sci-fi, it really makes you think about your own society and culture.",4,Zombie Apocalpyse meets Japanese school girls,1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,2497,"['High', 'School', 'dead', 'one', 'best', 'new', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'come', 'long', 'time', 'Between', 'story', 'cultural', 'elements', 'animation', 'quality', ""'m"", 'more', 'willing', 'look', 'relatively', 'minor', 'fan', 'boy', 'titillation', 'factor', 'enjoyment', 'show.Starting', 'Japanese', 'high', 'school', 'series', 'adventures', 'survivors', 'mostly', 'students', 'outbreak', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'surviving', 'flesh', 'eating', 'populous', 'infecting', 'cadavers', 'characters', 'have', 'look', 'reflect', 'roles', 'society', 'society', 'example', 'do', 'listen', 'teacher', 'body', 'liked', 'adult', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'authority', 'school', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'issue', 'anyone', 'culture', 'Japan', 'so', 'fixated', 'individual', 'knowing', 'place', 'society', 'nearly', 'revolutionary.The', 'quality', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'much', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', 'first', 'episode', 'get', 'view', 'infected', 'not', 'yet', 'turned', 'teacher', 'doing', 'header', 'out', 'window', 'concrete', 'below-', 'splat', 'Very', 'vivid', 'true', 'life', 'can', 'use', 'term', 'here', 'also', 'very', 'disturbing.The', 'characters', 'pretty', 'much', 'stock', 'types', 'familiar', 'anime', 'there', 'rule', 'girls', 'Bamboo', 'Blade', 'who', 'do', 'kendo', 'must', 'have', 'long', 'hair', 'talk', 'monotones', 'very', 'smart', 'girls', 'must', 'be', 'bitterly', 'unpleasantly', 'contemptuous', 'everyone', 'else', 'been', 'much', 'made', 'fan', 'boy', 'jiggle', 'factor', 'did', 'worry', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'anime', 'Akira', 'Najica', 'where', 'angles', 'are', 'always', 'skirts.The', 'girls', 'are', 'well', 'endowed', 'not', 'top', 'are', 'flashes', 'panties', 'just', 'flashes', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'girls', 'short', 'school', 'girl', 'skirts', 'active', 'combat', 'Most', 'skin', 'seen', 'more', 'realistic', 'setting', 'gratuitous', 'exception', 'school', 'doctor-', 'brainless', 'blond', 'bimbo', 'boobs', 'so', 'large', 'scaffolding', 'more', 'bra', 'move', 'audible', 'rumble', 'kettle', 'drum', 'found', 'annoying', 'jiggle', 'factor', 'fact', 'dumb', 'box', 'rocks-', 'doctor', 'was', 'bad.The', 'graphic', 'violence', 'not', 'kiddies', 'overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'High', 'School', 'Dead', 'Well', 'drawn', 'plotted', 'serious', 'creep', 'factor', 'horror', 'hallmark', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'really', 'think', 'own', 'society', 'culture']",N/A

This anime is about busty high school girls killing zombies.

However, this anime has a lot of action moments and comedy. I watched the original broadcast in Japanese. Then just recently, I found out that it was available in the US with English dubs. I didn't think twice to get it. The English dub is pretty good, and this is the kind of anime that you want American jokes in. I've watched this at least 8 times already and I'm not tired of it yet. It's one of those rare gens that you don't want to end. Apparently there is a sequel stated for September in Japan, so get this so you don't miss on anything.Ok, a little bit of the plot. Takashi is your regular lazy high school student. One day, he is skipping classes until he witnesses a murder right in front of the school gate; then the teachers that were there started killing each other. And that's where hell broke loose. You have Rei who was member of the spear club, Saeko was a member of the kendou club (sword techniques and stuff), Takagi is the school's genius girl who provides everyone with most of the info, and the school nurse who helps the team in different ways. Those are the girls in the team. Now the guys; Hirano is a student who used to get bullied a lot, but he didn't complain. He actually received military training and is the weapon's specialist of the group. Takashi is the guy who doesn't have a real skill other than to adapt to what's going on. He's got good thinking and he is most mental-stable person of the group (which is shown later on in the anime and manga). Takashi s the type of guy who has natural leader qualities. He tries to move forward with everyone and tries to help them in any way he can. Later on, they find a little girl named Alice.Basically, the whole world has been overrun with zombies or ""them,"" as they call them in the anime. The team works together to get to their goal, which is to make sure everyone's families is secure. They come across a variety of times such as weapons, motorcycles, cars, and even a bus. They move forward thinking of the best possible option for them to stay alive. There some conflicts, but that's what makes it exciting. Some fans have even stated that they like this better than the Resident Evil zombies, and it's not hard to understand why.Now, the blu-ray version is in full 1080p and it looks stunning. It has both Japanese and English audio in true HD. If you have a home theater, then this is the perfect anime to show it off. The animation is top notch and the action moments are great, though they ,ay go a little overboard in some parts. Also, it has nudity such as breasts and stuff. That's just a warning so that you don't watch this in front of someone who may feel offended by it. It also has some foul language.In short, this is really one of the best anime series to come to the West.",5,The perfect anime for the Western audience!,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,2841,"['Yes', 'lot', 'fanservice', 'part', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'However', 'anime', 'lot', 'action', 'moments', 'comedy', 'watched', 'original', 'broadcast', 'Japanese', 'Then', 'just', 'recently', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'available', 'US', 'English', 'dubs', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', 'get', 'English', 'dub', 'pretty', 'good', 'kind', 'anime', 'want', 'American', 'jokes', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'least', '8', 'times', 'already', ""'m"", 'not', 'tired', 'yet', 'one', 'rare', 'gens', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'Apparently', 'sequel', 'stated', 'September', 'Japan', 'so', 'get', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything.Ok', 'little', 'bit', 'plot', 'Takashi', 'regular', 'lazy', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'One', 'day', 'skipping', 'classes', 'murder', 'right', 'front', 'school', 'gate', 'then', 'teachers', 'were', 'there', 'started', 'killing', 'other', 'where', 'hell', 'broke', 'loose', 'have', 'Rei', 'who', 'was', 'member', 'spear', 'club', 'Saeko', 'was', 'member', 'kendou', 'club', 'sword', 'techniques', 'stuff', 'Takagi', 'school', 'genius', 'girl', 'who', 'everyone', 'most', 'info', 'school', 'nurse', 'who', 'team', 'different', 'ways', 'are', 'girls', 'team', 'Now', 'guys', 'Hirano', 'student', 'who', 'used', 'get', 'bullied', 'lot', 'did', ""n't"", 'complain', 'actually', 'received', 'military', 'training', 'weapon', 'specialist', 'group', 'Takashi', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'skill', 'other', 'adapt', 'what', 'going', 'got', 'good', 'thinking', 'most', 'mental-stable', 'person', 'group', 'shown', 'later', 'anime', 'manga', 'Takashi', 's', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'natural', 'leader', 'qualities', 'move', 'forward', 'everyone', 'tries', 'help', 'way', 'can', 'Later', 'find', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Alice.Basically', 'whole', 'world', 'been', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'call', 'anime', 'team', 'together', 'get', 'goal', 'make', 'sure', 'everyone', 'families', 'secure', 'come', 'variety', 'times', 'such', 'weapons', 'motorcycles', 'cars', 'even', 'bus', 'move', 'forward', 'thinking', 'best', 'possible', 'option', 'stay', 'alive', 'conflicts', 'what', 'exciting', 'fans', 'have', 'even', 'stated', 'like', 'better', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'zombies', 'not', 'hard', 'understand', 'why.Now', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'full', '1080p', 'stunning', 'both', 'Japanese', 'English', 'audio', 'true', 'HD', 'have', 'home', 'theater', 'then', 'perfect', 'anime', 'show', 'off', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'action', 'moments', 'are', 'great', 'ay', 'go', 'little', 'overboard', 'parts', 'Also', 'nudity', 'such', 'breasts', 'stuff', 'just', 'warning', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'front', 'someone', 'who', 'may', 'feel', 'offended', 'also', 'foul', 'language.In', 'short', 'really', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'series', 'come', 'West']",N/A

I liked it for several reasons but the main reason was Saeko.  What's not to like about a girl with a sword?A coworker saw me reading one of the books and told me about the series.  Of course I had to get it.Two things to note:1) It says the complete series which is sort of correct. It's the complete series of season 1 as it only covers about 5 of the Manga books from the series.  I should also comment that it stays reasonably faithful to the story.  There are changes but not enough for comment.2) This is for mature audiences. There are plenty of bouncing boobs, blood and suggestive shots of the girls.H.O.T.D is a zombie apocalypse story which starts in a private high school where the main character Takashi is pondering his misery when he observes the start of the plague in his school.  It quickly spreads and he tries to save his childhood love (Rei) and her boyfriend which happens to be his best friend.  The school becomes inhabitable due to the amount of zombies so they have to escape and along the way they pick up other survivors.Much of the stories involve running, fighting and hiding as they watch the world descends into chaos.There are 12 episodes which at first I thought was rather small for the $40 price tag.  My coworker said that is actually a good price as they are expensive in Japan.I would like to see season 2 but it didn't happen as I read the show did not do well in Japan.  I have read a few rumors that second series was announced.Overall, I liked the series.  Plenty of action, bouncy boobs, humor, great artwork, and interesting characters.

After that, the six main characters escape and try to find safe haven anywhere they can. (They also escape the school with a teacher and several other students in a bus, but the teacher turns out to be a power-mad wanna-be dictator of sorts who turns the surviving students into his own little cult, so the main characters-five students and the school nurse-separate from that group and try to make it on their own.)If you've seen American zombie movies it's pretty obvious this show was STRONGLY influenced by them. The same rules that went for most flesh-eating zombie films apply here as well: If a zombie bites you, you become one of them, and the only way to kill a zombie is to shoot or stab it in the head, killing it's brain. I also noticed at the very beginning what seemed to be a direct nod to the recent DAWN OF THE DEAD remake, when army helicopters pass over the heads of two of the lead characters when they're on the roof of the school building, but don't stop to help them.As the Amazon reviewer noted, we don't get any explanation as to why exactly the dead have risen and are attacking people. However the same thing is true for alot of ""killer zombie"" films. (The above-mentioned DAWN OF THE DEAD remake, the 1990 NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD remake, DIARY OF THE DEAD, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, ect.)

The series mostly focuses on about six teenagers from the same highschool as well as the school nurse and a young girl they save later on from the zombies,  and pretty much as seen by the trailers and online about all the females are beyond well endowed except understandably the young girl.  Again as expected the series will give you double the usual dose of fan service beyond what we've seen with most animes and even though it's hinted at of some sexual romantic relationships there not shown on the show so the only r-rated scenes you'll see other than the violence from the zombies is the standard topless scenes and panty shots.

HOTD will fully live up to - or down to - these stereotypes.  It is also 12 episodes of guilty pleasure, with zombies.For some unexplained reason, a plague has broken out all over the world, that turns people into ""them"". (The word ""zombie"" is never used)  But ""they"" shamble around, make weird noises, and bite people, their bite being rapidly fatal.  This doesn't end the story, because it seems that zombies, like Mormons, have the ability to convert the dead.  So the plague grows exponentially, and chaos ensues.When a local high school becomes infected, the intrepid survivors break free in the school bus, and search for friends, family and sanctuary, in a horror-comedic race against time (and, of course, zombies).  Most of the episodes follow a band of six escapees: the useless school nurse, who seems to exist only to rub her assets against everyone else; the spoiled rich girl who shouts a lot and keeps her hair impeccably groomed, and four kids who can fight, including a dark-haired kendo girl who acts like a demented Aoyama Motoko and whom I found the most engaging of the bunch.

1427281,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B004SGWYVA,trashcanman,"[126, 165]","By now we're all well aware of and are probably active participants in the media zombie pandemic.  What began with classic horror films has spawned countless novels, comics, television, comedies, video games, and everything else you can see or hear, infecting pop culture with the undead virus.  But I have been wondering something for quite some time now:  when will anime represent for the walking dead?  Well, that question has been answered, fellow animation fanatics.  Highschool of the Dead is here and delivering the thrills of classic Romero and the coolness of The Walking Dead, while utilizing the full spectrum of the anime genre to make this zombie apocalypse stand out as it's own animal.  And it is so close to perfectly awesome it hurts.Before I whine about the show's failing, let me fill you in on the good.  There's lots of it.  Right from the get-go Highschool of the Dead gets your heart racing with pure horror and some of the coolest action sequences ever animated.  As the sudden invasion quickly spreads through the halls of the high school, we are introduced to the individuals who will become our heroes.  While most students panic and quickly become prey to the ever-increasing host of ghouls, a few individuals pull it together and improvise means to fight back.  The otaku gun nut.  The kendo princess.  The ordinary kid whose best is brought out by extraordinary circumstances.  The haughty intellectual.  The airheaded school nurse. Over the first two episodes, these people will coalesce into a force to be reckoned with.  The show does an admirable job of remaining character-based and developing the relationships between it's survivors well after the extremely hectic initial outbreak, and as far as opening salvos go in survival horror, this show takes the damn cake for sure.  The art and animation are top-notch, the characters are instantly memorable, and also it's zombies!  And anime!  Sugoi, neh?Okay, time for some of that old-time tough love.  This show is one of the most exciting and cool anime series I've come across in a good while, and it ticks almost all of my boxes for a great zombie story, but on one front it really blows it. Rant mode: engaged.  I'm writing this paragraph as an introduction speech to present Highschool of the Dead with the first annual Najica Blitz Tactics Award for Achievement in Moronic Fanservice.  Hold your applause.  This is not a good thing.  God, this show could even teach Najica a thing or two.  It's frankly embarrassing.  I'm a big fan of sexuality in entertainment, but only when it is portrayed in a realistic and adult manner or at least matches the tone of the story.  But in a show where high school students are seeing their teachers and classmates being torn apart only to rise again and attack them in turn, having a character with ridiculously enormous breasts that make boingy noises and fly all over the place independently of each other every time she so much as blinks around is not only distracting, it literally brings the entire show down a notch.  I can deal with the pantyshots in every scene, but the incessant focus on the female characters' boobs makes this show infuriating.  At one point we get a bullet's-eye-view shot as one girl's breasts use a scissor motion to dodge said bullet.  And the bullet was fired from a rifle using another girl's breasts as a bipod (they slosh in slow motion with each shot fired).  Jesus God, WHY?!  Everything else about this show is so good!  The immaturity shown in HotD's use of fanservice is probably the most atrocious thing I've ever seen in terms of bringing down an otherwise amazing production.  Honestly, I'd be tempted to knock off another half star or so from the rating if the first season's second half didn't tone it down so much.  Be warned.[sighs] Glad to get that off my chest.  Okay, the good of HotD far outweighs the idiotic breast and panty fixation in an otherwise great show.  In fact, this would be instantly pushing for a spot on my favorite anime ever list if the childish sexuality had been presented in a more mature manner or omitted altogether.  If you love zombies and anime, this is a must-see.  This is brought to us by the same man who gave us the Death Note and Black Lagoon animes, after all. Each ep has a post-credits sequence that is often important to the story which makes the show feel even more theatrical than it already is and I like that the ending theme changes as well.  A mere 12 episodes is far too short a season for a show like this, and once you see the nod to Romero that is the final shot of the first season, I suspect you will be as excited as I am for the next chapter in the saga.  If they keep the fanservice manageable from here on out, we may just have a classic on our hands.",4,Could have been perfect.,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,4784,"['now', ""'re"", 'well', 'aware',

I was very impressed with the dubbing in this particular version of HotD. I've over time become somewhat used to bad dubbing in Japanese anime so I was glad to hear the voice actors putting in a lot of effort. They really did a good job of making the characters sound and act realistically.The Blu-Ray itself has great quality and because of that and the fact that it's uncut I noticed things that I never noticed in the original airing. The audio quality is also top notch.It has simple packaging with 2 Blu-Ray's. Eight episodes on the first disc and four episodes on the second disk.Like others have mentioned it is an action packed zombie apocalypse style anime with lots of blood, fan service, and a bit of vulgar language. Nothing worse than the kind you hear on the streets. You can learn much more about its contents from the current highest rated review so I won't go into a lot of detail.
