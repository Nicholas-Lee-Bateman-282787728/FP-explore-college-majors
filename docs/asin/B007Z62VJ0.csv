It goes beyond that idea to the realm of infinite ideas and possibilities.  I also felt the film did a great job in explaining why the Thought Exchange method is an effective alternative or supplement to self-help concepts like ""affirmations"" and ""your life is a mirror"".  It did a wonderful job of explaining the idea that everything is already here - we just need to discover it. This is a really valuable method to have in a self-improvement toolkit.  I am now going to buy the book.",5,Great Tool and Philosophy!,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,632,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'method', 'exchanging', 'positive', 'thoughts', 'negative', 'thoughts', 'idea', 'realm', 'infinite', 'ideas', 'possibilities', 'also', 'felt', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'explaining', 'why', 'Thought', 'Exchange', 'method', 'effective', 'alternative', 'supplement', 'self-help', 'concepts', 'affirmations', 'life', 'mirror', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'explaining', 'idea', 'everything', 'already', 'here', 'just', 'need', 'discover', 'really', 'valuable', 'method', 'have', 'self-improvement', 'toolkit', 'am', 'now', 'going', 'buy', 'book']",The Thought Exchange - Practical Method of Moving Beyond Positive Thinking

The concept that sensations - not to be confused with feelings - can be responsible for our successes or failures was new to me.  Failure to lose weight, for example, is caused by the unwillingness to accept and embrace the sensations we feel when we think about not being able to eat our favorite, fattening foods.  I must admit that I've given this more than cursory thought as a result of watching this film. I have suffered for several years from near debilitating grief over losing someone I loved, and changing my approach to grief by dealing with it as a sensation has helped me a great deal. The thoughts in this film are worth considering; the appeal of its technical aspects are pretty bad ... hence my 3 star rating, smack dab in the middle of really good and really bad.",3,Nyeh ...,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,865,"['movie', 'valuable', 'ideas', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'captivating', 'style', 'concept', 'sensations', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'feelings', 'can', 'be', 'responsible', 'successes', 'failures', 'was', 'new', 'Failure', 'lose', 'weight', 'example', 'caused', 'unwillingness', 'accept', 'embrace', 'sensations', 'feel', 'when', 'think', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'eat', 'favorite', 'fattening', 'foods', 'must', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'given', 'more', 'cursory', 'thought', 'result', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'suffered', 'several', 'years', 'debilitating', 'grief', 'losing', 'someone', 'loved', 'changing', 'approach', 'grief', 'dealing', 'sensation', 'helped', 'great', 'deal', 'thoughts', 'film', 'are', 'worth', 'considering', 'appeal', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'hence', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'really', 'good', 'really', 'bad']",The Thought Exchange - Practical Method of Moving Beyond Positive Thinking
