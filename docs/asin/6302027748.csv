The German Region 2/PAL DVD is even better than the LaserDisc I used to watch.  With it, the soundtrack may be switched to English in a pinch, but the original Lapp with subtitles conveys much more.The story is truly epic, yet told in a modest 88 minutes, and it is no wonder the Sami people passed this story down -- much like the Inuit tale of the Fast Runner.

291393,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302027748,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 1]","This is the story of a 16-year-old boy 1,000 years ago who finds himself fighting alone against the killers of his mother, father and little sister. It's part epic legend on a small scale and part coming-of-age. Whatever you choose to call it, Pathfinder is an exciting and moving tale. The story is set in the northern-most reaches of what is now Scandinavia amongst the nomadic family groups of the Sami, who hunt and herd reindeer. The landscape is beautiful, but harsh and frigid. Aigin returns one day from a hunting trip to see the corpses of his parents and little sister being dumped in a frozen lake through a hole in the ice. They have been killed by the Tchudes, outlaws who prey on the Sami. Aigin is spotted but manages to escape with an arrow in his shoulder to a small family group several miles away. They treat his wound but immediately prepare to flee to the coast. They know the Tchudes are most likely tracking Aigin. The boy refuses to leave. He plans to stay and fight. ""What would you do?"" Aigin is asked. ""Find them. Before they find us,"" Aigin says. ""Find them,"" one man says. ""We're not warriors!"" ""If they find us,"" Aigin says, ""you know what will happen. We will have to fight. No one will be spared. Not even the children."" And he's right. The Tchudes are outcasts, hard, experienced men who take what they want and slaughter everyone they catch. Three of the men decide to stay with him. There is a fight in the snow, with arrows against crossbows and axes. Aigin is captured. He may be brave, but he also is frightened. To save one of the men who has been his friend, he says he will be a pathfinder. He will show them through the icy passes in the mountains to the large encampment on the coast. His friend, of course, is slaughtered as soon as Aigin is out of sight.From here we switch back and forth between the encampment, largely made up of women and children as the men have left for hunting, and the journey through the frigid, snow-swept passes. This 16-year-old boy is up against two dozen killers, led by an utterly ruthless and shrewd leader. Aigin is no match for any of them if it comes to a fight. All Aigin has is his wits and, as we come to realize, a determination to protect the encampment by destroying the Tchudes even if it means sacrificing his own life. This is played out against the feelings of some in the settlement that Aigin is bad luck, that he led the Tchudes to them earlier and may very well be leading them to the coast where they are now. The conclusion is brutal, redeeming and satisfying.Pathfinder works so well, I think, because the story, which is a simple one, is treated in a straightforward, matter-of-fact manner. The emotions and motivations are simple and strong. The acting is plain and effective. Mikkel Gaup, the 19-year-old son of the film's director and writer, Nils Gaup, is a good-looking kid with blue eyes who comes across as exactly who he is playing, a capable young man who is brave and scared and determined. The feelings that start to show between Aigin and the young woman who treated his arrow wound are tentative and very low-key, and they're all the more touching because of that. This is a strong, affecting story with a little myth and legend-making woven in.",5,"A frigid, rousing adventure, as well as a touching film about courage and sacrifice",1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,3256,"['story', '16-year-old', 'boy', '1,000', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'fighting', 'alone', 'killers', 'mother', 'father', 'little', 'sister', 'part', 'epic', 'legend', 'small', 'scale', 'part', 'coming-of-age', 'choose', 'call', 'Pathfinder', 'exciting', 'moving', 'tale', 'story', 'set', 'northern-most', 'reaches', 'what', 'now', 'Scandinavia', 'amongst', 'nomadic', 'family', 'groups', 'Sami', 'who', 'hunt', 'herd', 'reindeer', 'landscape', 'beautiful', 'harsh', 'frigid', 'Aigin', 'one', 'day', 'hunting', 'trip', 'see', 'corpses', 'parents', 'little', 'sister', 'being', 'dumped', 'frozen', 'lake', 'hole', 'ice', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'Tchudes', 'outlaws', 'who', 'prey', 'Sami', 'Aigin', 'spotted', 'escape', 'arrow', 'shoulder', 'small', 'family', 'group', 'several', 'miles', 'away', 'treat', 'wound', 'immediately', 'prepare', 'flee', 'coast', 'know', 'Tchudes', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'tracking', 'Aigin', 'boy', 'leave', 'stay', 'fight', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'Aigin', 'asked', 'find', 'Aigin', 'Find', 'one', 'man', ""'re"", 'not', 'warriors', 'find', 'Aigin', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'will', 'have', 'fight', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'spared', 'Not', 'even', 'children', 'right', 'Tchudes', 'are', 'outcasts', 'hard', 'experienced', 'men', 'who', 'take', 'what', 'want', 'slaughter', 'everyone', 'catch', 'Three', 'men', 'decide', 'stay', 'fight', 'snow', 'arrows', 'crossbows', 'axes', 'Aigin', 'captured', 'may', 'be', 'brave', 'also', 'frightened', 'save', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'been', 'friend', 'will', 'be', 'pathfinder', 'will', 'show', 'icy', 'mountains', 'large', 'encampment', 'coast', 'friend', 'course', 'slaughtered', 'as', 'soon', 'Aigin', 'sight.From', 'here', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'encampment', 'largely', 'made', 'women', 'children', 'men', 'have', 'left', 'hunting', 'journey', 'frigid', 'snow-swept', 'passes', '16-year-old', 'boy', 'up', 'two', 'dozen', 'killers', 'led', 'utterly', 'ruthless', 'shrewd', 'leader', 'Aigin', 'match', 'fight', 'Aigin', 'wits', 'come', 'realize', 'determination', 'protect', 'encampment', 'destroying', 'Tchudes', 'even', 'sacrificing', 'own', 'life', 'played', 'out', 'feelings', 'settlement', 'Aigin', 'bad', 'luck', 'led', 'Tchudes', 'earlier', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'leading', 'coast', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'conclusion', 'brutal', 'redeeming', 'satisfying.Pathfinder', 'works', 'so', 'well', 'think', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'treated', 'straightforward', 'matter-of-fact', 'manner', 'emotions', 'motivations', 'are', 'simple', 'strong', 'acting', 'plain', 'effective', 'Mikkel', 'Gaup', '19-year-old', 'son', 'film', 'director', 'writer', 'Nils', 'Gaup', 'good-looking', 'kid', 'blue', 'eyes', 'who', 'exactly', 'who', 'playing', 'capable', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'brave', 'scared', 'determined', 'feelings', 'start', 'show', 'Aigin', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'treated', 'arrow', 'wound', 'are', 'tentative', 'very', 'low-key', ""'re"", 'more', 'touching', 'strong', 'affecting', 'story', 'little', 'myth', 'legend-making', 'woven']",N/A

""I almost care.""","[2, 2]","'Pathfinder' is a compelling drama set a thousand years ago in the cruel but inspiring hiemal wastelands of Lapland in northern Scandinavia.It's the story of young Aigin, his family slaughtered by brutal raiders, and his twin tasks of revenge and the protection of the friendly tribe that have adopted him.At times 'Pathfinder' is so realistic and extra-ordinarily beautiful, it's easy to forget that you're watching an engaging thriller, rather than a sensual travelogue or documentary.At it's core it has a set of ravagers as hispid and scary as any pack of wolves, and as ruthless and blood-lusting as any horror-movie mob bogeymen.Gore-splashed snowdrifts, broken bones and treachery are what you get when these hombre's sashay into the Christmas card vista and despoil the divine Panavision landscape you're admiring. They think nothing of killing women, children and pets with disturbing ambivalence.Led by a barbarous fugleman with executioner-cold eyes, these frozen-bearded Nordic Angels of Death trudge the ice and snow, meting instant dismissal to any-one in their path by crossbow, or when they get up close, elk-gutting knife.Aigin's alone, and his understandable terror of this intimidating clan is what makes his determination and eventual bravery against seemingly impossible odds, all the more admirable.To this addictive brew of violence and suspense, director Nils Gaup adds a touch of folklore mysticism. Portents of good and evil are introduced; in the form of a legendary buck-reindeer (set symbolically against a flickering borealis) and a cawing raven, high in the sky, as it's sinister counterpart.Nothing complex there, but it's effective and suggestive filming is warming and superbly satisfying.There's something sickening about blood on snow. Seal-kills by polar bears have the same effect, as does obscene whaling in the Arctic. Imagery that just seems to ignite something from our ancient psyches and wire-brush it against our nerve-endings.Gaup knows all this, and his film works here as well.'Pathfinder' is astonishingly good. Relatively short (85 mins) it says more about honour, sacrifice and the resolve of the human spirit than a hundred 'Saving Private Ryan's.Unmerciful and unbreakable, Lapland's snowy fauna is as much an intended character in the film as the snow in 'Dr Zhivago'. Gaup brilliantly emphasises the setting as part of the story, at the very least on a par with the characters and the legends that inspired it.If you possibly can, plot YOUR route to 'Pathfinder'.",5,Blood and Snow,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,2518,"[""'Pathfinder"", 'compelling', 'drama', 'set', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago', 'cruel', 'inspiring', 'hiemal', 'wastelands', 'Lapland', 'northern', 'Scandinavia.It', 'story', 'young', 'Aigin', 'family', 'slaughtered', 'brutal', 'raiders', 'twin', 'tasks', 'revenge', 'protection', 'friendly', 'tribe', 'have', 'adopted', 'him.At', 'times', 'so', 'realistic', 'extra-ordinarily', 'beautiful', 'easy', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'engaging', 'thriller', 'rather', 'sensual', 'travelogue', 'documentary.At', 'core', 'set', 'ravagers', 'hispid', 'scary', 'pack', 'wolves', 'ruthless', 'blood-lusting', 'horror-movie', 'mob', 'bogeymen.Gore-splashed', 'snowdrifts', 'broken', 'bones', 'treachery', 'are', 'what', 'get', 'when', 'hombre', 'sashay', 'Christmas', 'card', 'vista', 'despoil', 'divine', 'Panavision', 'landscape', ""'re"", 'admiring', 'think', 'nothing', 'killing', 'women', 'children', 'pets', 'disturbing', 'ambivalence.Led', 'barbarous', 'fugleman', 'executioner-cold', 'eyes', 'frozen-bearded', 'Nordic', 'Angels', 'Death', 'trudge', 'ice', 'snow', 'meting', 'instant', 'dismissal', 'any-one', 'path', 'crossbow', 'when', 'get', 'up', 'close', 'elk-gutting', 'knife.Aigin', 'alone', 'understandable', 'terror', 'intimidating', 'clan', 'what', 'determination', 'eventual', 'bravery', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'odds', 'more', 'admirable.To', 'addictive', 'brew', 'violence', 'suspense', 'director', 'Nils', 'Gaup', 'touch', 'folklore', 'mysticism', 'Portents', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'introduced', 'form', 'legendary', 'buck-reindeer', 'set', 'symbolically', 'flickering', 'borealis', 'cawing', 'raven', 'high', 'sky', 'sinister', 'counterpart.Nothing', 'complex', 'there', 'effective', 'suggestive', 'filming', 'warming', 'superbly', 'something', 'sickening', 'about', 'blood', 'snow', 'Seal-kills', 'polar', 'bears', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'whaling', 'Arctic', 'Imagery', 'just', 'ignite', 'something', 'ancient', 'psyches', 'wire-brush', 'nerve-endings.Gaup', 'film', 'here', 'as', 'well', ""'Pathfinder"", 'astonishingly', 'good', 'Relatively', 'short', '85', 'mins', 'more', 'honour', 'sacrifice', 'resolve', 'human', 'spirit', 'hundred', ""'Saving"", 'Private', ""Ryan's.Unmerciful"", 'unbreakable', 'Lapland', 'snowy', 'fauna', 'as', 'much', 'intended', 'character', 'film', 'snow', ""'Dr"", 'Zhivago', 'Gaup', 'brilliantly', 'setting', 'part', 'story', 'very', 'least', 'par', 'characters', 'legends', 'inspired', 'it.If', 'possibly', 'can', 'plot', 'YOUR', 'route', ""'Pathfinder""]",N/A

Someone recommended this movie to me that I could find available only on VHS.  Luckily, my video equipment works, the movie tape was not damaged, and I happened to see one of the most fabulous movies ever.  ""Pathfinder"" is made after Norwegian legend from Lapp ethnic group about the young boy who fights and wins over evil tribesmen.  When a young man discovers his family murdered by another tribe, he runs for his life thru unforgiving harshness and cold of Norway's winter.  He makes his way to another village just in time to warn them about the danger.  Determined to revenge his parents' and his sister's death he wants to fight the intruders, while the rest of the village wants to find their way safely to the sea where they will be protected by the mountains and another tribe.  The story unfolds as coming of age movie, but also a spiritual awakening story of a young man learns from a local holy man about good and evil, premonitions, and undeniable existance of higher power.  ""Pathfinder"" is a Lapp name for the holy man.  In that kind of world, almost 1,000 years ago, people were reverend of nature around them.  Every animal they had to kill for food would be killed by a holy man and then blessed for the rest of the tribe to enjoy.  Holy man would pray for them all and would heal the wounded and sick.  Man of wisdom who definitely leads the tribe in spite of the fact that tribe has its chief.  Chief however, looks miniscule compared to the spiritual strength and will of a man that everyone respects and fears.  The scenes of nature, winter, snow, animals and even people bundled in their animal skins are wonderful.  Storytelling is compelling and the lessons learns stay with one for a lifetime.

I saw this movie years ago.  I rented it from Blockbusters.  I bought it so that I could see it again any time I wanted.  If you own a DVD do not buy this movie from this site.  You will not be able to play it!  I am crushed.Contacted Amazon. This is a region 2 dvd that will only play in Japan and Europe. Only region 1 dvd will play in US and Canada and there is not a region 1 dvd. Amazon offered to refund me so I feel better.,5,very moving and beautiful,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,849,"['loved', 'movie', 'grandfather', 'was', 'Sami', 'movie', 'lot', 'movie', 'so', 'absorbing', 'felt', 'was', 'could', 'almost', 'feel', 'cold', 'snow', 'Beautiful', 'scenes', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'When', 'tried', 'see', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'player', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'played', 'said', 'DVD', 'prohibited', 'area', 'limitations', 'was', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'not', 'advertised', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'just', 'DVD', 'saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'rented', 'Blockbusters', 'bought', 'could', 'see', 'again', 'time', 'wanted', 'own', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'movie', 'site', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'am', 'crushed.Contacted', 'Amazon', 'region', '2', 'dvd', 'will', 'only', 'play', 'Japan', 'Europe', 'Only', 'region', '1', 'dvd', 'will', 'play', 'US', 'Canada', 'not', 'region', '1', 'dvd', 'Amazon', 'offered', 'refund', 'feel', 'better']",N/A
291404,AYIHIIOO7Z6P0,6302027748,Ruth Henriquez Lyon,"[39, 39]","This film, based on an ancient Sami legend, is a coming-of-age story about a boy who witnesses his family's murder by a brutal gang of thieves.  How he deals with these murderers, while protecting the rest of his tribe, makes up the principal plot.  The movie is simple--simple plot, simple dialogue, simple (but stunning) visuals, and this simplicity lends a great deal of strength to this work.  Everything unnecessary has been cut away, much like the lives of the Sami people, a tribal group closely tied to an unforgiving landscape and climate (Lappland).Although most of the film is action, there is a wonderful relationship that develops between the boy and the tribe's shaman, or &quot;pathfinder.&quot;  They have only a couple of conversations before fate separates them, but in those brief exchanges the pathfinder imparts all the knowledge the boy needs to take up the mantle of pathfinder himself.This film is beautifully crafted, well-paced, and provides a wonderful portrait of a culture which has much to teach.",5,a beautiful and moving film,983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,1026,"['film', 'based', 'ancient', 'Sami', 'legend', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'boy', 'who', 'family', 'murder', 'brutal', 'gang', 'thieves', 'How', 'murderers', 'protecting', 'rest', 'tribe', 'up', 'principal', 'plot', 'movie', 'simple', 'simple', 'plot', 'simple', 'dialogue', 'simple', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'simplicity', 'great', 'deal', 'strength', 'work', 'Everything', 'unnecessary', 'been', 'cut', 'away', 'much', 'lives', 'Sami', 'people', 'tribal', 'group', 'closely', 'tied', 'unforgiving', 'landscape', 'climate', 'Lappland', 'most', 'film', 'action', 'wonderful', 'relationship', 'boy', 'tribe', 'shaman', 'quot', 'quot', 'have', 'only', 'couple', 'conversations', 'fate', 'separates', 'brief', 'exchanges', 'pathfinder', 'knowledge', 'boy', 'take', 'up', 'mantle', 'pathfinder', 'himself.This', 'film', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'well-paced', 'wonderful', 'portrait', 'culture', 'much', 'teach']",N/A

It is definitely NOT a family film. It scared an 8 year old out of his mind and sent 2 teenaged girls out of the room in tears. Yes, it is a fierce story that has a lot of graphic cruelty. But the film also had the power to pull me so far into the story that I was wondering how the hero will pull it off, forgetting that it was a film. Now that's an achievement considering the film's provenance.The photography was excellent, the acting was somewhat unusual to me. But it did convey, effectively, a whole cultural outlook. The enemy Tchudes were vicious plunderers that took everything, even the lives, of a peaceful and generous people. How to fight this well armed group of psychopaths seemed to be impossible. But inventiveness and good does win out. The romantic ending was boffo because the hero really gets the girl.A mutli-region DVD player is a must for any film buff who wishes to explore this wide world of international cinema.",5,Superb yet obscure film.,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1012,"['first', 'Lapp', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'quite', 'experience', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'family', 'film', 'scared', '8', 'year', 'old', 'mind', 'sent', '2', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'room', 'tears', 'Yes', 'fierce', 'story', 'lot', 'graphic', 'cruelty', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'power', 'pull', 'so', 'far', 'story', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'hero', 'will', 'pull', 'off', 'forgetting', 'was', 'film', 'Now', 'achievement', 'considering', 'film', 'provenance.The', 'photography', 'was', 'excellent', 'acting', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'did', 'convey', 'effectively', 'whole', 'cultural', 'outlook', 'enemy', 'Tchudes', 'were', 'vicious', 'plunderers', 'took', 'everything', 'even', 'lives', 'peaceful', 'generous', 'people', 'How', 'fight', 'well', 'armed', 'group', 'psychopaths', 'seemed', 'be', 'impossible', 'inventiveness', 'good', 'win', 'out', 'romantic', 'ending', 'was', 'boffo', 'hero', 'really', 'girl.A', 'mutli-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'must', 'film', 'buff', 'who', 'explore', 'wide', 'world', 'international', 'cinema']",N/A
