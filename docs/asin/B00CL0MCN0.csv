1648547,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00CL0MCN0,Acute Observer,"[6, 9]","Perry Mason Season 9 Volume 2These fifteen TV shows from 1966 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative, they tell about life that is not experienced by most people. The books explain why some things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ""ropers"", rough or smooth shadows, how to evade surveillance, and avoid leaving a back trail. Some questioned the legality and ethics of Perry Mason's tactics but the stories were written before modern legal rules. The background tells about life in Los Angeles and America. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on today's broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? Erle Stanley Gardner was a founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free the unjustly convicted. Gardner sought to use scientific means to find the guilty rather than using hunches or guesses alone.The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent, but these films have a higher contrast than in earlier seasons. These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings and often tell about the law. The titles begin with ""The Case of The"".

At last, that is now the case with the last half of Season Nine in release.I watched Perry Mason as a kid, but I became an entrenched fan during the years that TBS ran the series in the 80s. I saw them round and round, until to this day many of them are like old friends when I view them again on DVD. However, these old friends bring continued surprises, as the DVD sets have the entire show, something that has likely never been true in any syndication of the series.I never felt that the quality of the acting, mysteries, or production dropped throughout Perry Mason's long run. The final few shows were as entertaining as the first.As others have mentioned, this set contains the very entertaining dual role episode, with Raymond Burr playing both Mason and the alcoholic merchant marine hired to get Mason into hot water.Not only have I always been entertained by Perry Mason and his mysteries, but I learned a few things along the way too. Mason was a great role model with his firm stands against those without ethics. I admired that backbone and made sure to grow it myself, and it has served me well over the decades.We can't thank most of them in person anymore, but regardless my thanks go out to Erle Stanley Gardner, Raymond Burr, Barbara Hale, William Hopper, William Tallman, Ray Collins and the dozens of judges, hundreds of guest stars, and the outstanding writers who brought us so much entertainment for so long, and made these characters our friends.RIP",5,A long road draws to a close,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1633,"['Many', 'fans', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'have', 'watched', 'release', 'season', 'expectantly', 'hoping', 'momentum', 'stayed', 'entire', 'series', 'made', 'DVD', 'last', 'now', 'case', 'last', 'half', 'Season', 'Nine', 'release.I', 'watched', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'kid', 'became', 'entrenched', 'fan', 'years', 'TBS', 'ran', 'series', '80s', 'saw', 'round', 'round', 'day', 'many', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'when', 'view', 'again', 'DVD', 'However', 'old', 'friends', 'bring', 'continued', 'surprises', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'entire', 'show', 'something', 'likely', 'never', 'been', 'true', 'syndication', 'series.I', 'never', 'felt', 'quality', 'acting', 'mysteries', 'production', 'dropped', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'long', 'run', 'final', 'few', 'shows', 'were', 'as', 'entertaining', 'first.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'set', 'very', 'entertaining', 'dual', 'role', 'episode', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'playing', 'Mason', 'alcoholic', 'merchant', 'marine', 'hired', 'get', 'Mason', 'hot', 'water.Not', 'only', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'entertained', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'mysteries', 'learned', 'few', 'things', 'way', 'too', 'Mason', 'was', 'great', 'role', 'model', 'firm', 'ethics', 'admired', 'backbone', 'made', 'sure', 'grow', 'served', 'well', 'decades.We', 'ca', ""n't"", 'thank', 'most', 'person', 'anymore', 'regardless', 'thanks', 'go', 'out', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'Barbara', 'Hale', 'William', 'Hopper', 'William', 'Tallman', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'dozens', 'judges', 'hundreds', 'guest', 'stars', 'outstanding', 'writers', 'who', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'entertainment', 'so', 'long', 'made', 'characters', 'friends.RIP']","Perry Mason: The Ninth and Final Season, Vol. 2"

But unlike, say, CBS's Rawhide, which was abruptly canceled that same fall, Perry Mason was allowed to complete the season and film a full 30 episodes. So, many of these episodes in season 9 volume two, have a nice touch, giving the writers, actors, and producers a chance to leave the viewer in good stead. There is some great comedy in this volume, like Victor Buono's broad manipulations as the mastermind of inept adolescent thieves, in color, in The Case Of The Twice Told Twist; his slow burns while pondering the fools around him is his best appearance in the series. Raymond Burr gets to play Perry Mason and a drunken sailor in The Case Of The Dead Ringer.

As the show's stars aged gracefully, the producersdecided to focus on youth culture. So the episodes have teenagers, British pop-stars, Dick Clark, shyster talent managers, coffee houses replete with '60's dancing, motorcycles, fast cars, & surfing references. Raymond Burr is still the greatest, however he has gained considerable weight & his hair has been plastered down on his head. If anything, he looks like he's preparing for the infinitely-inferior ""Ironsides"" series.While it's interesting to see the one episode shot in color, I feel it's perhaps the worst show of all 9 seasons.Of course, pandering to a younger audience, it deals with juvenile delinquents & car theft. The whole thing feels strained & Perry & Della seem out of place in a pedestrian teen drama. The other episode people either love or despise is the one where Raymond Burr plays Perry Mason, & also a drunken, loud seaman, as a kind of doppleganger. I find this episode incredibly tiresome w/ hammy overacting, but it is amusing. Luckily, there are several episodes that involve the adult world (& better-quality, experienced actors). The golf club episode is a thing of malicious beauty. I guess if the show had gone another season, they would have had The Monkees & riots on the Sunset Strip. Though I love the late '60's, that world does not work in the more film noir B&W; world of Perry Mason. Though unrealistic & with a repetitive formula involving last-minute courtroom confessions, PM is/was one of the best shows ever on television, due to the lead actors chemistry, guest character actors, the lighting, sets & locations.
