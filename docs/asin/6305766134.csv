477013,A24PTVSZSM8968,6305766134,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I usually like 80s movies even if they are a little tacky. This particular movie is a mess. It is about a girl who is a dishwasher and gets hired by limousine  company that has only stodgy male drivers. I suppose it's supposed to be one of those feel-good movies where an outsider character eventually breaks through and is successful. There are a couple of extended scenes where she drives odd or difficult customers around. The customers appear to have happy endings but she ends up in trouble for some mistake she made. There's also a creepy romantic angle where she falls in love with s client who starts out being a complete jerk, has an inexplicable change of heart, turns out to be the boss' son, might be her brother and then... In any case, the acting is fairly bad, the scenes are a bit disorganized and the story has a pile of loose ends. To make matters worse, the film is extremely politically incorrect with a number of scenes that would be considered to be inappropriate and highly disrespectful today. There really aren't many redeeming qualities for this movie and I cannot really recommend it.

477017,A2IOI5MO10XO80,6305766134,"Elak Swindell ""Movie Addict""","[0, 0]","Initially, I snagged this DVD for two reasons - it had Deborah Foreman in it (which I'm a fan of) and I wanted to hear the soundtrack.  Gladly, I never saw it back in the 80s, so it was entirely fresh to me.  I'm really happy that it's a part of my DVD library now, for it is very funny and Deborah looks her best since ""Valley Girl"".  Funny thing is, right from the start, when she shows up at the Brentwood Limousine Company, her acting surprised me due to it being so familiar.  Then it hit me, she mixed together the character style of her friend, Michelle Meyrink (from ""Real Genius"") and a bit of Ally Sheedy from ""The Breakfast Club"".  Michelle in the fast talking, always hyper personality and Ally for the quick responses like ""No!"".  If you are a fan of ""The Breakfast Club"", you'll know what I'm talking about.  Michelle also played her friend in ""Valley Girl"" as well, but that characterization was totally different than when she was in ""Real Genius"".  The soundtrack is quite good too.  Hard to find The Wigs album though.  Supposed to be coming out on CD sometime soon.  Only one song in the movie stinks by them and that's the extremely repetative ""Fire"" tune that they play in the club.  Also didn't know this was Penn & Teller's first movie.  Penn plays a con artist and Teller an Arabian sheik.  You would never guess that they would become so well-known in the magic-comedy business from their roles in the film.

477021,A3GYVMUS7SSDFW,6305766134,Kyle Tolle,"[0, 0]","`My Chauffeur' is a better than average comedy from the mid 80's that deserves its time in the spotlight.  Even though it can be regarded as a cult classic these days, that's okay because it is still as funny now as it was then.  Despite what it may look like on the outside, this isn't a chick flick and it can be enjoyed by everyone in general.Casey Meadows (Deborah Foreman of `Valley Girl' fame) becomes the first woman to ever drive for the exclusive and male dominated Brentwood Limousine company.  She definitely knows how to make an appearance showing up with a wild hairdo and freaky wardrobe selection that sends the other drivers around the bend.  Her sometimes wicked behavior doesn't hurt one bit either. The company dispatcher Mr. McBride (Howard Hesseman of `WKRP in Cincinnati' fame) takes offense to everything about her and gives her the worst driving assignments to be had.  This works out fine for the movie because she gets herself into some very funny situations that set the tone for some great follow on scenes.Later in the movie, Casey is assigned to drive Battle (Sam Jones of `Flash Gordon' fame) who happens to be the son of the company owner Mr. Witherspoon who hired her in the first place.  At first this turns out to be difficult as Battle doesn't like to associate with the hired help but he still ends up in funny predicaments over and over.  Later on, in a nice twist of fate, Casey and Battle actually end up as a romantic item but there is a crazy family secret that may or may not spoil their relationship.When watching `My Chauffeur', don't expect top notch acting or a tightly defined plot but just enjoy it for a lot of good laughs and some clever humor laid out in good installments through the movie.  It's just over 90 minutes of innocent fun in a simplistic kind of way.

477023,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6305766134,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","Long a favorite. And to this very day, I can't see this movie without being stunned by Deborah Foreman's beauty - 25 years later and it's never gotten to the point where I'm weary or finding myself having 'moved on'. She is, for me, the epitome of sweet sexuality blended within a complex mix of quirky fun and raw energy. If I were to compare her to another actress - the only one that even comes close would be Carole Lombard. Interestingly, while writing this review, I did a Google Image Search for a recent picture - and I was stunned to see that's she's just as beautiful today as she was back then. Amazing genes. Amazing smile.In this film - and in my opinion her best role in such a short career - she plays hapless dishwasher Casey Meadows. And like so many fairy tales, begins with a beautiful girl trapped in a miserable life.Until the one day when a mysterious envelope is delivered to her dungeon-like existence.Contained within that envelope is a job offer to become a luxury limousine driver. It's her ticket out, if she can hang on long enough to cash it.Her arrival to the staid chauvinist all-gentleman's club begins a hilarious and genuinely fun romp as we ride along with her multitude of escapades & adventures. Everything from dealing with insane clients to earning respect from her mean-spirited fellow drivers. Simultaneously, there's an intriguing understory, a secret that will engulf all the main characters and potentially undo all the good deeds her guardian angel has quietly positioned for Casey's future prospects.There are so many tender and really touching scenes (some might describe them as unabashedly sentimental) that, admittedly, do tend to hail from the Dickens-school of dramatics. And equally there are some insanely hilarious moments and one incredibly romantic scene, gratefully without the cheap trope of lead actress nudity. Notably, there's also a memorable hefty meat display for the ladies in there too, as rugged Sam Jones puts on quite a show. &lt;g>And speaking of which - this movie is also a poignant highlight in the career of the handsome actor. He was at the peak of his virility; his thespian skills and his timing were pitch perfect as the detached executive and scion to the corporation founded by his kind-hearted father, played by the inimitable E.G. Marshall. He would, in my opinion, never again achieve this level of quality performance. And I take absolutely no pleasure in saying that because, like so many people, I have a soft spot for underdogs; truly celebrating when career character actors like Terry O'Quinn hit the right roles and suddenly become breakthrough stars. Unfortunately for Jones, just like fellow 80's macho man Ken Wahl, he just seemed to catch all the wrong breaks at the wrong times. There's so much unfulfilled potential in his resum&eacute;.Thankfully, under the direction of David Beaird, the lead actors put on a clinic of how to do a romantic-comedy in the best traditions of legendary teams likeWilliam Powell and Myrna Loy. 'My Chauffeur' is an extremely enjoyable flick in the old school tradition that will entertain, tickle and charm its way into the hearts of romantic souls.Couple of Notes:- I have to make mention of the amazing dream-inspired opening soundtrack by Michael Galasso. It succinctly captures the essence of Casey Meadows and her story. I only wish it were commercially available.- Leland Crooke, a favorite character actor, was never funnier as the Johnny Rotten-like punk rock singer. His malicious band of sex kittens and their twisted ""global scavenger hunt"" inspired years of jokes between myself and my college classmates as we drove around hoping to score 10,000-bleeping-points with a blue-haired woman walking a blue dog wearing blue panties!

I just recently watched my bootleg copy I made from a neighborhood video store copy(pre-Blockbuster...they were ALL little neighborhood stores) and had an immediate lovely flashback to those days. I also noted that the music seems to be Michael Nyman, or Nyman-ish, which, in his similarity to Philip Glass, made the movie all that much more charming. I can't speak for the DVD but the VHS version, although weak in places, is still charming in the low-key, New Wave way that now seems so naive. Wasn't it great to NOT have celphones and PCs and the internet? Not to mention that New Wave was still NEW. *sigh* Goes well with the much-more-cool &quot;Something Wild&quot;.

Cult actress Deborah Foreman, star of such films as VALLEY GIRL, APRIL FOOLS DAY, WAXWORK, and LOBSTER MAN FROM MARS gives her best performance yet, defying all other mainstream 80's starlets such as Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy.The plot centers around Foreman's character Casey Meadows, who has just been hired for a position as a chauffeur at the elite Brentwood Limiousines Ltd. Casey is not welcomed by her new colleagues, mainly because she happens to be the only female working there. Can Casey prove them wrong and save her job? The film takes us on a journey through all of Casey's driving escapades, which include a feisty punk star, an Arabian prince, and ultimately, the son of the owner of Brentwood, where the climax of the film begins.When I watched this movie for the first time, it reminded me of other 80's flicks like MANNEQUIN and MAID TO ORDER. This comedy flick surpasses those though, mixing elements of 1930's screwball comedy and VALLEY GIRL style. After this film being virtually unavailable for years, Rhino productions has kindly re-released it on VHS and DVD. If you dont posess a liking for 80's films in general, you most likely will not enjoy this film, but if you have an open mind and a love for campy 80's pop culture, then you will no doubt love this film.MY CHAUFFER also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 13 years old in the 7th grade when this movie was theatrically released in the Winter of 1986.",4,My Chauffer Rocks!,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,1605,"['Sleek', 'cars', 'stuffy', 'old', 'men', 'Madonna-esque', 'high', 'spirited', 'girl', 'are', 'ingredients', '1980', 'comedy', 'reached', 'cult', 'status', 'deservingly', 'Cult', 'actress', 'Deborah', 'Foreman', 'star', 'such', 'films', 'VALLEY', 'GIRL', 'APRIL', 'FOOLS', 'DAY', 'WAXWORK', 'LOBSTER', 'MAN', 'FROM', 'MARS', 'best', 'performance', 'yet', 'defying', 'other', 'mainstream', '80', 'starlets', 'such', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Ally', 'Sheedy.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Foreman', 'character', 'Casey', 'Meadows', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'hired', 'position', 'chauffeur', 'elite', 'Brentwood', 'Limiousines', 'Ltd.', 'Casey', 'not', 'welcomed', 'new', 'colleagues', 'mainly', 'be', 'only', 'female', 'working', 'there', 'Can', 'Casey', 'prove', 'wrong', 'save', 'job', 'film', 'journey', 'Casey', 'driving', 'escapades', 'include', 'feisty', 'punk', 'star', 'Arabian', 'prince', 'ultimately', 'son', 'owner', 'Brentwood', 'where', 'climax', 'film', 'begins.When', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'reminded', 'other', '80', 'flicks', 'MANNEQUIN', 'MAID', 'TO', 'ORDER', 'comedy', 'flick', 'surpasses', 'mixing', 'elements', '1930', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'VALLEY', 'GIRL', 'style', 'film', 'being', 'virtually', 'unavailable', 'years', 'Rhino', 'productions', 'kindly', 're-released', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'dont', 'posess', 'liking', '80', 'films', 'general', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'love', 'campy', '80', 'pop', 'culture', 'then', 'will', 'doubt', 'love', 'film.MY', 'CHAUFFER', 'also', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'was', '13', 'years', 'old', '7th', 'grade', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Winter', '1986']",N/A
477036,A2PDVQRK9PSIPJ,6305766134,Tamarleigh Lippegrenfell,"[3, 7]","SPOILER ALERT: This review discusses the plot in detail.This film is shockingly hideous from start to finish, with the sole exception of Penn Jillette's awesome cigarette trick, which lasts all of thirty seconds. Other than that, this movie is PAINFUL to watch. Let's review.This is a love story, but you won't care about the love story because: the man and the woman are both such horrible people that you really don't care what happened to them, AND to make matters worse, they fall in love for no apparent reason whatsoever -- there is literally nothing that happens that is in any way romantic or bonds them together as friends or lovers. Probably that's because they are both seemingly devoid of any conscience or endearing qualities (other than the requisite Hollywood good looks).At first, we just think he's a cranky, demanding businessman, but we figure he's got a heart of gold underneath. Let's find out.1. When he's having an argument with his girlfriend, who is trying to leave him for good (she's fallen in love with, and is carrying the child of, another man), she has stormed from the vehicle. He chases her down, grabs her, throws her over his shoulder, swats her on the butt, and shoves her into the vehicle. The swat on the butt is the most offensive part -- it isn't done in any sort of playful sense whatsoever, nor in any sort of flirtatious sense; it is done in a disciplinary fashion, as though it is his job as the boyfriend to physically control and discipline her. But I guess it's okay, because assault is hilarious!2. When he gets drunk, he runs around like a fool in the park, and at one point thinks it's fun to grab a baby carriage away from a mother strolling with her child in the park, run around pushing the baby carriage like a drunken fool, weaving around, keeping it out of reach of the increasingly frantic mother, paying no attention whatsoever to the child's safety or well-being. But I guess it's okay, because kidnapping is hilarious!And then there's the woman. What's her character like?1. When she's driving some total jerk rock star around, he tells her to stop the car. He and his entourage of scantily clad women get out of the car, chase down a woman who is walking her dog in the park, surround her, wrestle her to the ground, allow her dog to run off, lift her skirt up and expose her underwear, and then forcibly strip her of her underwear, which they steal (allegedly for some stupid game, of which we learn nothing at this or any other point in the film). The protagonist not only fails to report this, but then later actually DEFENDS the actions of her passengers when she is chastised by her boss for allowing this to take place. But I guess it's okay, because molestation is hilarious! Especially if the victim is elderly and overweight.2. In the only scene with any redeeming features whatsoever, the woman is driving Penn and Teller around. Of course, they're not playing themselves; Teller is playing a diplomat from the Middle East, and Penn is playing a scam artist who is blatantly stealing from the diplomat. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together could have detected that the diplomat did not speak English and that the other passenger was a con artist, but again the woman does nothing whatsoever to protect the victim or to report it afterwards. There is an absolutely epic thirty seconds of Penn doing awesome cigarette tricks, but other than that (or just enjoying seeing Penn and Teller so young and Penn acting so silly), this was just a scene of the protagonist acting like a clueless, irresponsible jerk.The Love Story1. They don't get along. Some stupid pointless dialogue to make that clear. Car trouble. Long hike through the wilderness. She is complaining; he is ignoring her. In order to prove a point (that he should listen to her), she allows him to back into a giant pit. She doesn't know anything about the area, the terrain, the depth of the pit, or what's at the bottom of it, but she lets the guy back into it just to prove that he should be listening to her. It turns out to be mud. But I guess it's okay, because teaching someone a lesson by needlessly risking his life is hilarious!2. They find somewhere to stay. They argue about how he treats women. She specifically mentions the way he treated his (now ex-) girlfriend. He pulls her into a kiss that she initially resists, but she immediately melts into his arms, and they make passionate love in front of a roaring fire in the fireplace. Worst Love Story Ever. As the subplot about the old rich guy unfolds, the viewer is put in the position of knowing that the rich guy is the MAN's father, and simultaneously strongly suspecting that the rich guy might also be the WOMAN's father. Eventually, they are informed by the rich guy that he IS her father! The two of them laugh bashfully and say, ""We've been bad!"" EWWWW. But I guess it's okay, because incest is hilarious!In the end, it turns out that he's NOT her brother after all! They immediately get married! And they are driven away in a limo. The End.The ONLY reason I kept watching this hideous movie all the way through is that I was already planning this review and was just making notes about how horrible the movie is, as the story grew more and more appallingly bad.I am sure I can find videos of Penn Jillette doing cigarette tricks on YouTube.
