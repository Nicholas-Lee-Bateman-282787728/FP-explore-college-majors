But this was not the right day to watch his long and rather gory bit about violence. Also, we have to admit that 15 year old jokes are sometimes a bit dated.Still, I give it four stars, though not five, because I couldn't help laughing, and because George has such an incredible imagination. Also great delivery: does he really memorize all those crazy lists? The facial expressions and gestures and silly walks and all are not buffoonery, but part of the story.This is a good show, but maybe wait until the story about the Tucson shooting is a little older before you watch it.",4,More George Carlin Nostalgia,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,625,"['[', 'Written', '1/12/11', ']', 'love', 'George', 'really', 'do', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'day', 'watch', 'long', 'rather', 'gory', 'bit', 'violence', 'Also', 'have', 'admit', '15', 'year', 'old', 'jokes', 'are', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'dated.Still', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'five', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laughing', 'because', 'George', 'incredible', 'imagination', 'Also', 'great', 'delivery', 'really', 'memorize', 'crazy', 'lists', 'facial', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'silly', 'walks', 'are', 'not', 'buffoonery', 'part', 'story.This', 'good', 'show', 'maybe', 'wait', 'story', 'Tucson', 'shooting', 'little', 'older', 'watch']",George Carlin - Back in Town

728157,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00007G1WT,Michael Crane,"[20, 20]","George Carlin is one of my favorite comedians, being that he has never found a way to not make me laugh.  While I enjoy his older stuff the best, his new bitter and angry stuff is funny too.  ""George Carlin: Back in Town"" represents Carlin as he is today; angry, sarcastic, and over-the-top.  And it is all executed so perfectly.He talks about everything, and does not hold back for one second.  Just when you think he can't say anymore to shock you, he does.  In this HBO special he talks about abortion, how capital punishment should be televised, the sanctity of life, state prison farms, familiar expressions, and more.  Plus, it includes one of my all time favorites: ""Free Floating Hostility;"" a very long rant about MANY things that tick him off.  The title is more than appropriate for it, believe me.I wouldn't recommend him to people who get offended easily or don't like controversial topics being jokes like abortion or religion.  And he does have quite a mouth on him, so if you do not like profanity you better skip it right now.  However, if you ARE a fan of the man, then I recommend getting this as soon as possible!  I've had the CD for quite some time, but it's nothing like seeing him in action.The DVD doesn't really have any special features or anything extra to offer (or at least nothing I am aware of).  The picture looks great and the sound is really good.  It would've been cool if there was an interview or two, perhaps a documentary would be nice.  Still, it is a worthy purchase.""George Carlin: Back in Town"" is a hilarious DVD and an outrageous HBO special.  As soon as you pop this baby into your DVD player, you know you're in for one hell of a ride.
