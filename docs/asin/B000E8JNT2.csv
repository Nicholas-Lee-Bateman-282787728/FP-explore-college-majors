Thankful ""RolyPolyBear""","[9, 39]","Got this DVD from the library to see if I could show my son what is going on inside his mom and what is happening with his sibling.  What you get is a bizarre ""bellycam"" shot of the exposed mom's belly walking around and also being way too close to a stove when she's cooking (is she trying to burn herself?) If you are NOT into evolutionary views, some of the ""science"" dialogue will bother you (the usual bit about us being so closely related to chimps and daffodils etc...) I didn't appreciate the naked views of the outside of the woman either, since I just wanted my child to see what was going on inside mommy---not for him to see pornography diguised as ""science"".  Also, no mention of God whatsoever or the true miracle that every child is.  Very disappointed, but I guess, what should I have expected from National Geographic?  Pass on this one---the science info you learn could be learned elsewhere and you wouldn't have to be exposed to women in half shirts and bare breasts.",1,"Not for conservative, modest Christian households!",1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,987,"['Got', 'DVD', 'library', 'see', 'could', 'show', 'son', 'what', 'going', 'mom', 'what', 'happening', 'sibling', 'What', 'get', 'bizarre', 'bellycam', 'shot', 'exposed', 'mom', 'belly', 'walking', 'around', 'also', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'close', 'stove', 'when', 'cooking', 'trying', 'burn', 'are', 'NOT', 'evolutionary', 'views', 'science', 'dialogue', 'will', 'bother', 'usual', 'bit', 'being', 'so', 'closely', 'related', 'chimps', 'daffodils', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'naked', 'views', 'outside', 'woman', 'just', 'wanted', 'child', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'inside', 'mommy', '-not', 'see', 'pornography', 'diguised', 'science', 'Also', 'mention', 'God', 'true', 'miracle', 'child', 'Very', 'disappointed', 'guess', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'expected', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Pass', 'one', '-the', 'science', 'info', 'learn', 'could', 'be', 'learned', 'elsewhere', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'exposed', 'women', 'half', 'shirts', 'bare', 'breasts']",N/A

We have a childbirth class upcoming and we want to learn as much as possible beforehand, so that we can ask intelligent questions at the class.The video is educational and shows you what your child is experiencing at each stage of pregnancy. While we both learned a lot, we thought that the videos inside the mother's womb were the most-amazing aspect of the film; it would be interesting to know how National Geographic managed to get these incredible videos.The only part of the film that I thought was ""off"" was a sequence in which a surgeon inserted a balloon into a developing fetus in order to prevent a birth defect; I thought that this segment was very interesting, but it seemed to be out of place given that the rest of the film focused on the development of one fetus. Potential viewers should also be aware that this video focuses on fetal development - not birth. In the Womb includes the birth at the end, but (as the title suggests) the nine months of fetal development are the focus of the film.I highly recommend In the Womb.
