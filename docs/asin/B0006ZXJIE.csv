The voices of some of the fairies could have been a bit more pleasant than what they were...geese, some of them sounded like an ole' hag rather than a spring chicken fairy.Kelly Sheridan (the voice of Barbie in all her movies)did another great job as Barbie/Elina.The storyline was creative, but in some cases a bit drawn out, some scenes could have been deleted.

876153,AGG9C66TOLJZB,B0006ZXJIE,"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[14, 19]","I was a bit frustrated by this movie. It seemed to be mostly product oriented - lots of fairys to buy, lots of flowers to buy, lots and lots of add-ons to buy - but not much of a story. It gets 2 stars for a story, but 3 stars for imagination and animation which I thought was pretty good.I think this movie is better suited to older kids. It is actually quite confusing - Elina (Barbie) is a fairy without wings and teased mercilessly by the other fairies for it. She lives in a flower in a meadow with other fairies and her (annoying) side-kick bibble. Bibble never says anything, he just bibbles and babbles incoherently. I must say I prefer side-kicks like Penelope in Rapunzel, or the unicorn in Swan Lake who actually add to the story.Anyway, evil comes to the meadow and it is up to Elina to fix it, she sets off with her friend, but all flying things are suffering from the fug over the meadow and she soon turns back. It is up to Elina alone.The adventure takes her all over the place and finally she solves the puzzle and her strength and friendship overcomes all.The things I really disliked about this movie - the teasing at the start from the other fairies, it was mean - and I know it is all fictional but I just hated seeing it, it just seemed wrong. The story was too disjointed, I think, Elina just seemed to go on endless voyaging rather than coherent story development (which was so good in Princess and Pauper and Swan Lake)The things I liked were the colours and animation (except when elina walked, that is, everything but Elina walking which looked all wrong to me). Again, I really liked the fact that Elina manages to solve things on her own. She is able and ready and while not completely brave she is prepared to try what she has to.This may be better for older girls but it is completely lost on my young ones, and I am quite grateful - buying all the associated toys would be a nightmare!To the makers of these movies, please do another musical -Princess and the pauper is our all time favourite - great songs, great animation, great message and great fun.",3,"Not good for under 5 year olds, they lose the story quickly, more product oriented",1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,2085,"['was', 'bit', 'frustrated', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'mostly', 'product', 'oriented', 'lots', 'fairys', 'buy', 'lots', 'flowers', 'buy', 'lots', 'lots', 'add-ons', 'buy', 'not', 'much', 'story', '2', 'stars', 'story', '3', 'stars', 'imagination', 'animation', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.I', 'think', 'movie', 'better', 'suited', 'older', 'kids', 'actually', 'quite', 'confusing', 'Elina', 'Barbie', 'fairy', 'wings', 'teased', 'mercilessly', 'other', 'fairies', 'flower', 'meadow', 'other', 'fairies', 'annoying', 'side-kick', 'bibble', 'Bibble', 'never', 'anything', 'just', 'bibbles', 'babbles', 'incoherently', 'must', 'say', 'prefer', 'side-kicks', 'Penelope', 'Rapunzel', 'unicorn', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'who', 'actually', 'add', 'story.Anyway', 'evil', 'meadow', 'Elina', 'fix', 'friend', 'flying', 'things', 'are', 'suffering', 'fug', 'meadow', 'soon', 'back', 'Elina', 'alone.The', 'adventure', 'place', 'finally', 'puzzle', 'strength', 'friendship', 'all.The', 'things', 'really', 'disliked', 'movie', 'teasing', 'start', 'other', 'fairies', 'was', 'mean', 'know', 'fictional', 'just', 'hated', 'seeing', 'just', 'seemed', 'wrong', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'disjointed', 'think', 'Elina', 'just', 'seemed', 'go', 'endless', 'voyaging', 'rather', 'coherent', 'story', 'development', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Princess', 'Pauper', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'things', 'liked', 'were', 'colours', 'animation', 'when', 'elina', 'walked', 'everything', 'Elina', 'walking', 'looked', 'wrong', 'Again', 'really', 'liked', 'fact', 'Elina', 'solve', 'things', 'own', 'able', 'ready', 'not', 'completely', 'brave', 'prepared', 'try', 'what', 'to.This', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'older', 'girls', 'completely', 'lost', 'young', 'ones', 'am', 'quite', 'grateful', 'buying', 'associated', 'toys', 'would', 'be', 'nightmare', 'makers', 'movies', 'please', 'do', 'musical', '-Princess', 'pauper', 'time', 'favourite', 'great', 'songs', 'great', 'animation', 'great', 'message', 'great', 'fun']",N/A

Of course it has Barbie and fairies so it was an instant hit.  As any mom who has to watch movies over and over again I appreciate quality in children's movies and look for movies my daughter will love and I will not go crazy watching reapeatedly.  My daughter truly enjoys the movie.  It was a let down for me.The movie is 70 minutes long (compared to 78 min for Nutcracker, 83 min for Rapunzel, 83 min for Swan Lake, and 85 min for Princess and the Pauper) and seems to be meant as a set-up for a series of Fairytopia movies and to sell fairytopia dolls. (if you see the feature in called Meet New Friends, or something along those lines, it shows many of the products related to the line, which is one the most shameless promotions I've seen for the series.  No inspirational true life stories of girls achieving their goals or anything of the sort in this one, unlike some of the previous movies which did include some nice extras).The movie introduces a lot of characters that are not at all developed and has a very flimsy story.  I guess that is why I am not giving it 5 stars.  I've seen what Barbie movies can be, and this one was not the best.  The previous four Barbie movies based on classic stories are wonderful.  I can watch them with my daughter every time and do not get tired of them.  They are extremely well developed for this kind of movie.  They used well known voice talents that brought a certain credibility to the movies which I had not expected when I first saw them advertised.  This one is not in the same level as the previous four. It is sort of like the difference between Disney's Aladdin and the two sequels.  The sequels were not bad, but they just were not as well produced as the first one.  While the first four Barbie movies were almost flawless within their category of little girl movies, and actually raised the bar in quality animation and storytelling within said category, Barbie Fairytopia is just one more movie for your child's collection.  Not really one to stand out.After all is taken into consideration, Barbie Fairytopia is a cute movie with a nice message.  Little kids will more than likely want to see it again and again.  Little girls will probably want to dress up as Barbie - Elina for Halloween this year and want Fairytopia birthday parties.  It is deffinitely not a waste of money.

Elina and her friends are chased by firebirds and fungus. Elina has to get past guards and other obstacles. It has a lot of self sacrifice and and doing things for those you care about. There is some humor and the animation is beautiful. I don't agree with the reviews that say the animation is half-done and ugly...I found it to be enchanting and whimsical. The pastel colors blend with the bright ones to make the overall color scheme very pretty. However, there's a couple of things I didn't like.1: Elina and Nalu's little... 'relationship'. It's so ridiculous! They hold hands as he pulls her through the water and they look all dove-eyed into each other's faces and smile and then when they have to leave, Nalu grabs her hand and says, ""Be safe. I hope we meet again."" He swims off and leaves Elina smiling and looking fondly in his direction. And I'm like, ""What?!?!?!?"" In Mermaidia, he's in love with Nori! Is it just me, or is this Prince Nalu a player and a cassanova????2:The two happy trolls who rhyme all the time bug me. They're a major marketing ploy. They're irritating and there because they'll be another thing to sell. And they are ugly, big-eyelashed dwarfs who act all sweet and innocent and smile one-toothed simles. They get on Elina's nerves a little, but not enough. Not the way they would in real life.Overall, though, I really like this movie.
