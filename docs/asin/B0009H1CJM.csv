This DVD captures Bonnie Raitt at her absolute best as a singer-songwriter and blues-guitarist. As a guitarist myself, I was blown away by Bonnie's performance. The songs are great, the band is great, the atmosphere at Montreux is fantastic.

You can tell it was from the 1970's because of the hair styles of some of the band members. Their performances are simply outstanding. You get 11 great songs from the 1977 concert, plus, 4 more from Bonnie & her ""up-dated"" 1991 band. Luckily, the 1991 timing was great, because Bonnie had just released the Grammy Award winning album 'Luck of the Draw' and she was receiving lots & lots of radio airplay from that album at the time. Bonnie is a great blues vocalist & guitarist and this concert dvd proves it. She has my repect. She can Rock!!! This is a ""must-have"" for any Bonnie Raitt fan, and I am one. Therefore, I highly recommend this dvd. I think you'll enjoy it very much.

I don't feelthis show captured Bonnie at her best but it does a nice jobof showing her un-polished R&B; rootsy styles she did such a great job doing effortlessly. I first saw a live Raitt showin Boston 1975 @the Music Hall and that show just blew thisone to pieces but this is a nice bit of history for Bonnie fans.She really had a much better command of her vocals during thistime period, I think she may have been touring all over theplace and her voice shows it here and there. The 1991 showsare a totally different Bonnie Raitt. Her stage presense andvocals just flow and her slide guitar smokes & the band is one of the best out there atthe time, they did everything from funked up rock to back porch country blues, you name it Bonnie is so smooth yet at thetop of her game. Thisis a collectors items not to be missed.

The night she played there, she sung most of her songs from her newest album, ""Souls Alike"". The night was beautiful at the Ravinia Festival and she played in the Pavilion. She played along with Keb'Mo, whom was the opening act and later after her performance which won a standing ovation, the both of them played together. Keb'Mo was outstanding. If you are a Bonnie Raitt fan as I am, you would have had a wonderful time. I praythat her performance June 23 & 24, 2006 will soon be put on DVD, I will be the first to buy it.D.

Watching this was like a look back at a slimmer, less-gray me. The performance is A1, and both the audio & video recording are excellent. The extras from '91 are OK, too, but this from 1977 is when I saw Bonnie & band every time I could for at least 8 or 9 years.
