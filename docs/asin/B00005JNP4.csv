But this is a surpringly watchable movie. Humor, cruelty, and cruel humor in its sharp, witty dialogue keep it moving. Warm, too, and not always as predictable as a typical review might make it seem. At times, it tries to be more than it is, such as when waxing philosophical about ""the upside of anger,"" but generally it's just a strikingly realistic portrayal of some less than perfect characters and how they interact.

633572,AUJFO0J9A2HGE,B00005JNP4,Alcee Arobin,"[6, 6]","I must admit that when I bought this film, I was expecting the storyline to follow the same, stale, husband-done-me-wrong plot.  It was Joan Allen that eventually forced me to whip out the checkbook.  And so, I was incredibly surprised to find this to be a movie of such depth.First of all, as practically all reviewers have raved, Allen and Costner are phenomenal.  It was mid-way through the film that I realized how superb the acting was, as they were actually making me fall in love with utterly unlikable characters.  Joan Allen has long-since been the most underappreciated actress in Hollywood.  It was hard for me to watch Julia Roberts walk away with her 2001 Oscar for the lackluster ""Erin Brockovich,"" while Ms. Allen's amazingly convincing performance in ""The Contender"" went without even a nod.  As for the coming award season, yes Charlize Theron was wonderful in ""North Country,"" and I'm sure that Reese Witherspoon will be lovely in ""Walk the Line"" (or at least I think I'm sure), but come on people, Joan Allen's moment to shine is years past due.  But Ms. Allen doesn't carry this film on her own.  As stated earlier, Kevin Costner is amazing.  I liked his performance in this film more than any of his previous roles.  Yes, he has a heart for sweeping epics, and yes ""Dances with Wolves"" was a great film, but to see him so subdued, and really capturing the essence of this man he was portraying was truly enjoyable to watch.  He has reinvented his career.And finally, all of the whining about the plot redirecting its aim.  I honestly don't understand all of the problems so many people seem to have with this.  To me, it only made the film all the more enjoyable, proving that in that end, perhaps the only champion to anger is divine irony.  Life, fairly often, will throw both at you.This is a great film and highly recommended on my part.",5,One of the Best Films of 2005,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,1862,"['must', 'admit', 'when', 'bought', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'storyline', 'follow', 'same', 'stale', 'husband-done-me-wrong', 'plot', 'was', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'eventually', 'forced', 'whip', 'out', 'checkbook', 'so', 'was', 'incredibly', 'surprised', 'find', 'be', 'movie', 'such', 'depth.First', 'practically', 'reviewers', 'have', 'raved', 'Allen', 'Costner', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'was', 'mid-way', 'film', 'realized', 'how', 'superb', 'acting', 'was', 'were', 'actually', 'making', 'fall', 'love', 'utterly', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'long-since', 'been', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'actress', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'walk', 'away', '2001', 'Oscar', 'lackluster', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Ms.', 'Allen', 'amazingly', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Contender', 'went', 'even', 'nod', 'coming', 'award', 'season', 'yes', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'was', 'wonderful', 'North', 'Country', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'will', 'be', 'lovely', 'Walk', 'Line', 'least', 'think', ""'m"", 'sure', 'come', 'people', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'moment', 'shine', 'years', 'due', 'Ms.', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'stated', 'earlier', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'amazing', 'liked', 'performance', 'film', 'more', 'previous', 'roles', 'Yes', 'heart', 'sweeping', 'epics', 'yes', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'see', 'so', 'subdued', 'really', 'capturing', 'essence', 'man', 'was', 'portraying', 'was', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'reinvented', 'career.And', 'finally', 'whining', 'plot', 'redirecting', 'aim', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'problems', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'only', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'proving', 'end', 'perhaps', 'only', 'champion', 'anger', 'divine', 'irony', 'Life', 'fairly', 'often', 'will', 'throw', 'you.This', 'great', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', 'part']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)
633573,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005JNP4,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[1, 3]","Despite great performances, this film is a dismal portrait of an unlikable character. We are told that Terry's husband has gone to Sweden with his secretary, and that for 3 years, never contacted his family (wife and 4 teenage to adult girls). We are told that Terry was ""sweet"" before this event, and has changed. What we see is a manipulative control freak with a bad drinking habit, and one must suspect that the seeds of this were always there.I find the biggest flaw is the basic premise of the film, which I can't mention because it would be a spoiler. I had a nagging feeling throughout the film that something didn't make sense, and in reflecting on the story after seeing the film, I realized that I had been duped, and that the very clever twist ending was a actually a silly one. There would have been too many unanswered questions for the plot to unfold as it does.Joan Allen is superb as Terry, but it is hard to have sympathy for her, even though she asks for compassion in her time of need. Kevin Costner is also excellent as Denny Davies, Terry's booze buddy turned lover, an ex-baseball star with a radio talk show, and a beer for breakfast type of guy. Yes, the liquor runs like a river in this film, but the dialogue is often weak, and many scenes seem unresolved. As the daughters, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Alicia Witt and Keri Russell all do their parts beautifully.""The Upside of Anger"" was written and directed by Mike Binder, who also plays Shep, Denny's producer. Shep is a bit of a reprobate, but gives Terry an earful of truth at a wedding party, and has some of the best scenes in the film. The score by Alexander Desplat is lovely with some nostalgic songs included, like Neil Diamond's ""Girl, You'll Be a Woman Now."" DVD extras include deleted scenes, and commentary. Total running time is 118 minutes.SEMI-SPOILER:We all have favorite things. Things we use daily and wouldn't like to live without. If I ever ""disappeared,"" I would hope that the family I had been living with for nearly 2 decades would notice if for instance, my journal and favorite pen had not ""disappeared"" with me.",3,The Downside of a Flawed Premise,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,2127,"['great', 'performances', 'film', 'dismal', 'portrait', 'unlikable', 'character', 'are', 'told', 'Terry', 'husband', 'gone', 'Sweden', 'secretary', '3', 'years', 'never', 'contacted', 'family', 'wife', '4', 'teenage', 'adult', 'girls', 'are', 'told', 'Terry', 'was', 'sweet', 'event', 'changed', 'What', 'see', 'manipulative', 'control', 'freak', 'bad', 'drinking', 'habit', 'one', 'must', 'suspect', 'seeds', 'were', 'always', 'there.I', 'find', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mention', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'had', 'nagging', 'feeling', 'film', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'reflecting', 'story', 'seeing', 'film', 'realized', 'had', 'been', 'duped', 'very', 'clever', 'twist', 'ending', 'was', 'actually', 'silly', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'plot', 'unfold', 'Allen', 'superb', 'Terry', 'hard', 'have', 'sympathy', 'even', 'compassion', 'time', 'need', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'also', 'excellent', 'Denny', 'Davies', 'Terry', 'booze', 'buddy', 'turned', 'lover', 'ex-baseball', 'star', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'beer', 'breakfast', 'type', 'guy', 'Yes', 'liquor', 'river', 'film', 'dialogue', 'often', 'weak', 'many', 'scenes', 'seem', 'unresolved', 'daughters', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'all', 'do', 'parts', 'beautifully', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'who', 'also', 'Shep', 'Denny', 'producer', 'Shep', 'bit', 'reprobate', 'Terry', 'earful', 'truth', 'wedding', 'party', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'score', 'Alexander', 'Desplat', 'lovely', 'nostalgic', 'songs', 'included', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'Girl', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Woman', 'Now', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '118', 'minutes.SEMI-SPOILER', 'have', 'favorite', 'things', 'Things', 'use', 'daily', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'live', 'ever', 'disappeared', 'would', 'hope', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'nearly', '2', 'decades', 'would', 'notice', 'instance', 'journal', 'favorite', 'pen', 'had', 'not', 'disappeared']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)
633574,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JNP4,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 4]","Those famous words by Bob Dylan say a lot about the love in this movie. The characters here, especially the adults, are damaged, unable to cope with major disappointments and challenges in their lives. Denny Davies, Costner, once had it all. A star pitcher for a pro ball team, he is now reduced to talking sports on the radio and selling autographs, two lonely occupations that give him no pleasure. Terry Wolfmeyer, rich and mother of four lovely girls, has been abandoned by her husband. Both have descended into a state of perpetual inebriation, never severe enough to be life threatening, always severe enough to keep real emotions and maturity away. They bump together not because of love's strong magnetism, but rather, because unanchored boats in a harbor eventually must bump into each other during storms.The great strength of the movie is that these people are not attractive, they're whiny, cynical, self-pitying, narcissistic drunks. They hang together out of convenience and desperation, in time, some sort of affection develops. But Terry has to push Denny pretty hard before he can relocate the confidence and focus he must have had on the mound, and demand something real. It's a defining moment in the film, a moment when Terry and Denny realize the four daughters are far more mature than they are. In case you don't know the movie's surprise ending I will only say that in the final analysis it only cements what should have been pretty obvious already.  That is, both these people were extremely blessed and their wallowing, while understandable, is best viewed as a necessary stage of grieving and not a lifestyle.A point of clarification about the leads. Joan Allen is one of our best actresses, incapable of delivering anything less than a stellar performance. Mr. Costner, by contrast, earned this role I'm happy to say. It was not always thus. Before there was a Brad Pitt, before there was a Tom Cruise, the handsome young idiot devoid of acting talent women adored was Kevin Costner. The young Costner was so stiff on camera that blocks of wood actually complained that he was giving them a bad name. (For a great example, sample his performance in The Untouchables, you would bet he was holding his script.) Because of his completely undeserved success Costner was allowed to stick around and make more movies. In the process, he improved a good bit. In TUOA we see how much.Costner is loose in this role, rumpled, casual, messed up. Just right. When he does show passion, it's believable. That's a pleasure. To see Costner holding his own with an actress of Joan Allen's stature, and actually creating a meaningful synthesis that causes us to care, is an accomplishment. This is a smart, beautifully made movie worth watching.",5,"""My Love She's Like Some Raven At My Window With A Broken Wing""",1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2756,"['famous', 'words', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'say', 'lot', 'love', 'movie', 'characters', 'here', 'especially', 'adults', 'are', 'damaged', 'unable', 'cope', 'major', 'disappointments', 'challenges', 'lives', 'Denny', 'Davies', 'Costner', 'once', 'had', 'A', 'star', 'pitcher', 'pro', 'ball', 'team', 'now', 'reduced', 'talking', 'sports', 'radio', 'selling', 'autographs', 'two', 'lonely', 'occupations', 'give', 'pleasure', 'Terry', 'Wolfmeyer', 'rich', 'mother', 'four', 'lovely', 'girls', 'been', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'have', 'descended', 'state', 'perpetual', 'inebriation', 'never', 'severe', 'enough', 'be', 'life', 'threatening', 'always', 'severe', 'enough', 'keep', 'real', 'emotions', 'maturity', 'away', 'bump', 'together', 'not', 'love', 'strong', 'magnetism', 'rather', 'unanchored', 'boats', 'harbor', 'eventually', 'must', 'bump', 'other', 'storms.The', 'great', 'strength', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'attractive', ""'re"", 'whiny', 'cynical', 'self-pitying', 'narcissistic', 'drunks', 'hang', 'together', 'convenience', 'desperation', 'time', 'sort', 'affection', 'develops', 'Terry', 'push', 'Denny', 'pretty', 'hard', 'can', 'relocate', 'confidence', 'focus', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'mound', 'demand', 'something', 'real', 'defining', 'moment', 'film', 'moment', 'when', 'Terry', 'Denny', 'realize', 'four', 'daughters', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'mature', 'are', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'surprise', 'ending', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'final', 'analysis', 'only', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'already', 'people', 'were', 'extremely', 'blessed', 'wallowing', 'understandable', 'best', 'viewed', 'necessary', 'stage', 'grieving', 'not', 'lifestyle.A', 'point', 'clarification', 'leads', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'incapable', 'delivering', 'anything', 'less', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Mr.', 'Costner', 'contrast', 'earned', 'role', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'thus', 'was', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'handsome', 'young', 'idiot', 'devoid', 'acting', 'talent', 'women', 'adored', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'young', 'Costner', 'was', 'so', 'stiff', 'camera', 'blocks', 'wood', 'actually', 'complained', 'was', 'giving', 'bad', 'name', 'great', 'example', 'sample', 'performance', 'Untouchables', 'would', 'bet', 'was', 'holding', 'script', 'completely', 'undeserved', 'success', 'Costner', 'was', 'allowed', 'stick', 'around', 'make', 'more', 'movies', 'process', 'improved', 'good', 'bit', 'TUOA', 'see', 'how', 'much.Costner', 'loose', 'role', 'rumpled', 'casual', 'messed', 'up', 'Just', 'right', 'When', 'show', 'passion', 'believable', 'pleasure', 'see', 'Costner', 'holding', 'own', 'actress', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'stature', 'actually', 'creating', 'meaningful', 'synthesis', 'care', 'accomplishment', 'smart', 'beautifully', 'made', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)

The Upside of Anger (2005) stars Joan Allen and Kevin Costner along with 4 young actresses I've followed in other movies and TV shows.  I had heard from several critics that Kevin Costner was quite good in this movie, but I found the story and Costner's acting to be flat for me.  Joan Allen was definately great as she almost always is, but even Allen couldn't lift this script beyond ""average"".  It wasn't a bad movie, but it just didn't capture me.  Maybe it was just so much of a ""female"" driven comedy/drama that being a man I couldn't relate...although that's usually not a problem for me.

633578,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JNP4,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","Can a film about an embittered wife - whose husband left her to head to Sweden with his secretary - make for interesting watching, and not seem like a chick-flick or invite opportunities for male-bashing? Surprisingly the answer is ""yes"".Meet Mrs. Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen), a woman on the edge. Her husband's run off with the office slut (or so she thinks) and now she's left to finish off raising their almost-adult daughters. Add to this a drinking, washed-up, baseball hall-of-famer who lives nearby and is ""interested"" in her, and you've created an entirely new layer.Mrs. Wolfmeyer is forced to battle alcoholism, parental duties related to sex and relationships, and, most destructively, her own anger. She pushes away all those whom she loves, and does so via some hilarious film making. For instance, there's a scene where she's at a restaurant table and has just discovered that her eldest daughter (who's in college) is pregnant and getting married. She meets her future son-in-law's parents and proposes a toast, at which time she drains her bloody mary. Then, when she sits, she raises her glass again to signal to a waiter that she needs another, and everyone thinks she's making another toast, so they raise their glasses again. Extremely funny moments like this punctuate what could have been a drab and dreary movie.Kevin Costner pulls off his best roll to date, creating a deep and equally shallow man all wrapped in one. His on-screen persona was so much different than anything I'd ever seen him play before. I'd dare say that this is my favorite Costner performance.The film pulls you not-so-gently into these people's lives and makes us live with them during their best and worst times (sometimes it's difficult to tell when you're in a ""best time"" versus a ""worst time"", too.)The ending was definitely a shocker; something that came out of the blue and plowed into me. A pleasant surprise.The only issues some might have with the movie is that it has no action. There's no battle scenes or fight sequences. It's a human tale with real people living out real problems. If you enjoyed such films as THE SHIPPING NEWS and the like, you'll probably enjoy this one.",4,"A Funny, Touching, Human Tale",1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,2180,"['Can', 'film', 'embittered', 'wife', 'husband', 'left', 'head', 'Sweden', 'secretary', 'make', 'interesting', 'watching', 'not', 'seem', 'chick-flick', 'invite', 'opportunities', 'male-bashing', 'Surprisingly', 'answer', 'yes', '.Meet', 'Mrs.', 'Wolfmeyer', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'woman', 'edge', 'husband', 'run', 'off', 'office', 'slut', 'so', 'now', 'left', 'finish', 'off', 'raising', 'almost-adult', 'daughters', 'Add', 'drinking', 'washed-up', 'baseball', 'hall-of-famer', 'who', 'nearby', 'interested', ""'ve"", 'created', 'entirely', 'new', 'layer.Mrs', 'Wolfmeyer', 'forced', 'battle', 'alcoholism', 'parental', 'duties', 'related', 'sex', 'relationships', 'most', 'destructively', 'own', 'anger', 'away', 'whom', 'so', 'hilarious', 'film', 'making', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'restaurant', 'table', 'just', 'discovered', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'who', 'college', 'pregnant', 'getting', 'married', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'parents', 'toast', 'time', 'bloody', 'mary', 'Then', 'when', 'glass', 'again', 'signal', 'waiter', 'everyone', 'making', 'toast', 'raise', 'glasses', 'again', 'Extremely', 'funny', 'moments', 'punctuate', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'drab', 'dreary', 'movie.Kevin', 'Costner', 'best', 'roll', 'date', 'creating', 'deep', 'equally', 'shallow', 'man', 'wrapped', 'one', 'on-screen', 'persona', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'different', 'anything', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'play', ""'d"", 'dare', 'say', 'favorite', 'Costner', 'performance.The', 'film', 'pulls', 'not-so-gently', 'people', 'lives', 'live', 'best', 'worst', 'times', 'difficult', 'tell', 'when', ""'re"", 'best', 'time', 'versus', 'worst', 'time', 'too', 'ending', 'was', 'definitely', 'shocker', 'something', 'came', 'blue', 'plowed', 'pleasant', 'surprise.The', 'only', 'issues', 'might', 'have', 'movie', 'action', 'battle', 'fight', 'sequences', 'human', 'tale', 'real', 'people', 'living', 'out', 'real', 'problems', 'enjoyed', 'such', 'films', 'THE', 'SHIPPING', 'NEWS', 'like', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)
633579,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B00005JNP4,Boggman!,"[3, 3]","""The Upside of Anger"" is a pleasant surprise. One would think that a movie about a middle aged woman, bitter and boozed up up over the sudden disappearance of her cheating husband; and doing her best to raise her 4 adult daughters would scream ""chick flick"" and make for 2hrs of terribly unfunny male bashing.Instead.. what we get is a remarkably honest and relate able performance by Joan Allen. Her Terry Wolfmeyer is quite a character indeed. Terry is mad. MAD, MAD, MAD! After her hubby all but abandons her and her family, Terry whiles away the days watching TV with a smoke in one hand and a drink in the other. She's sarcastic to everyone she comes in contact with and is pretty much fed up with the suburban ""American Dream"".Enter neighbor Denny Davies, a ex baseball playing, pot smoking, beer guzzling radio talk show host - who after hearing about Terry's predicament- decides to become her new neighborly drinking buddy. He doesn't seem to mind Terry's moodiness and although she initially pushes him away- she tends to grow fond of his company.Of course, the two grow closer and closer until you can only guess what's developing....but the movie ends with a slight twist that this reviewer was not to particularly fond with.Ending aside however, the ""Upside of Anger"" is quite an entertaining and well acted piece of work. Having never, never, NEVER, been a Kevin Costner fan- this reviewer was immediately taken with his performance of Denny Davies. Costner shines in his supporting role fantastically. This is definitely some of his best work in years, if not ever. His strong presence helps ""The Upside of Anger"" become a movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy.There's a lot more to ""The Upside of Anger"" than what I've just mentioned above. Interesting sub plots with Terry's daughters and one of Denny's co-workers helps the film come full circle.Recommended!!",5,Things aren't always as they seem......,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,1885,"['Upside', 'Anger', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'bitter', 'boozed', 'up', 'up', 'sudden', 'disappearance', 'cheating', 'husband', 'doing', 'best', 'raise', '4', 'adult', 'daughters', 'would', 'scream', 'chick', 'flick', 'make', '2hrs', 'terribly', 'unfunny', 'male', 'bashing.Instead..', 'what', 'get', 'remarkably', 'honest', 'relate', 'able', 'performance', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Terry', 'Wolfmeyer', 'quite', 'character', 'indeed', 'Terry', 'mad', 'MAD', 'MAD', 'MAD', 'hubby', 'abandons', 'family', 'Terry', 'away', 'days', 'watching', 'TV', 'smoke', 'one', 'hand', 'drink', 'other', 'sarcastic', 'everyone', 'contact', 'pretty', 'much', 'fed', 'up', 'suburban', 'American', 'Dream', '.Enter', 'neighbor', 'Denny', 'Davies', 'ex', 'baseball', 'playing', 'pot', 'smoking', 'beer', 'guzzling', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'who', 'hearing', 'Terry', 'predicament-', 'decides', 'become', 'new', 'neighborly', 'drinking', 'buddy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'Terry', 'moodiness', 'initially', 'away-', 'grow', 'fond', 'company.Of', 'course', 'two', 'grow', 'closer', 'closer', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'what', 'developing', 'movie', 'slight', 'twist', 'reviewer', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'fond', 'with.Ending', 'aside', 'however', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'well', 'acted', 'piece', 'work', 'Having', 'never', 'never', 'NEVER', 'been', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'fan-', 'reviewer', 'was', 'immediately', 'taken', 'performance', 'Denny', 'Davies', 'Costner', 'shines', 'supporting', 'role', 'fantastically', 'definitely', 'best', 'work', 'years', 'not', 'ever', 'strong', 'presence', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'become', 'movie', 'audiences', 'can', 'thoroughly', 'lot', 'more', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'what', ""'ve"", 'just', 'mentioned', 'above', 'Interesting', 'sub', 'plots', 'Terry', 'daughters', 'one', 'Denny', 'co-workers', 'film', 'come', 'full', 'circle.Recommended']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)

633588,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B00005JNP4,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[4, 5]","In many ways this is a predictable movie and is somewhat cliche'-ridden, but there are enough redeeming qualities throughout that make this film worthwhile.Joan Allen is a great actress and never disappoints, especially in this film. Kevin Costner is kind of surprising, not necessarily in the character he portrays, an ex-pro baseball player, which isn't exactly a stretch for him since he's done a few similar roles before, but what's really different about it is how he approaches this retired, burned out, introspective middle-aged man.I enjoyed the film because it's a very humanistic story, and I felt that Costner was drawing from personal experience in his portrayal which is probably why it was so believable. Joan Allen on the other hand is also very real, flesh and blood, desperate woman going through a flood of emotions after she believes her husband ran off with his Swedish secretary to Sweden, and she's left to pick up the pieces along with their four daughters. Her family is affluent of upper pedigree, well-mannered and sophisticated but of course that kind of becomes a facade that crashes down all around her as her young daughters rebel in their own ways, perhaps blaming their mom on a subconscious level for their dad leaving them.The daughters could have been further developed and were left slightly two-dimensional, but that was because the story focused mostly on the relationship between the angry, grieving mom and her rushed love affair with the radio DJ, ex-baseball pro. Joan Allen's character finds solace in him because for one he's there as a trusting, friendly and witty neighbor who gradually wins over the hearts of her daughters, but also because he's just a good guy, he's the calm in her storm and helps bring some rationale to her chaotic existence. The radio DJ takes on the role of a surrogate father but also as the ""cool adult"", which helps win over the heart of the mom.Despite the focus on the relationship between Costner and Allen, the audience gets to know the youngest daughter fairly well, as well as the second oldest. The youngest sibling is a bit of a paradox, she's constantly dismissed as an ignorant and inexperienced child but ends up displaying incredible maturity and wisdom by the end of the film. The 2nd oldest is misunderstood and doesn't get the respect she deserves from her mom because she studied interpretive dancing, an art form her mom doesn't understand, therefore doesn't respect. There's an important lesson to be learned there by not only the mother, but also people who watch the film, which is that there is more to life to be appreciated than what is within the limited scope of an individual's experiences, and even though this film might not delve too deeply into this concept, it deals with it in a respectful and moving manner that makes one think twice about things we might be unfamiliar with or not fully understand, and might end up appreciating once exposed to the beauty one facet of the human experience.Most of the cliche'd moments occur at the dinner table and involve stereotypical moments between the mom and daughters, and the in-jokes that they laugh at, which is kind of a standard for films like this, but it doesn't really hurt the film too much. I suppose it would have been more effective had the audience gotten to know all 4 girls as well as the mom.There are several sub-plots that happen simultaneously, but they aren't quite as important and serve more as a distraction than an exploration of this family's troubles of coping with a broken home. Several moments of genuine joy and sadness make this movie a soulful, moving experience and has one of the best endings I've seen in a movie.I fully recommend this film to anyone, and even though this type of film is considered to be a chick flick by most, don't let that scare you away, because it's worth watching and just might give people a better view of one's own family or even others and how perfect a family may seem, everybody has their problems, so it definitely promotes tolerance and understanding, and that's never a bad thing.

Their relationship grows, there bond and his bond with her daughters strengthens as they learn together the truth of her husbands sudden departure.  The acting is wonderful here on the part of Allen and Costner and thats really what carries this simple plot from being slightly entertaining to wonderfully made and a very rewatchable film.  Sometimes we don't give ourselves the opertunity to greive like we should...we bottle up out anger instead of properly displacing it and we end up hurting the ones we love because we have to let it out somehow and it usually comes out wrong.  Allen, who should be up for an oscar here, may not make it to the final race but she will always remain to me the dark horse that should have made it.

633592,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00005JNP4,David E. Levine,"[13, 15]","I am a fan of Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. Their acting was great in this movie, however, the plot and and the material they had to work with was lacking. Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) has four daughters and when her husband disappears, evidentally running off with his young secretary, she becomes bitter, angry, and unbearably controlling of her daughters. Her husband's friend, Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) is a former baseball player and current radio personality. What just does not make sense is how Denny so easily works his way into Terry's life when Terry is so shattered by her husband's evident betrayal. It doesn't ring true. They start off as drinking buddies and quickly move into a romance. Denny makes some moves on Terry, such as sneaking into the bathroom while Terry is in the shower, which would never further a possible relationship. In real life, some of Denny's audatious behavior would lead to a restraining order against a character such as Denny. In the script, such behavior (albeit well acted by Costner) is not believable.To make this movie even more incomprehensible, Terry, her daughters, Denny and everyone else involved have misconceptions about Terry's husband. We have no clue as to how these misconceptions arose. It just isn't explained in any way. Each of Terry's four daughters is involved in her own subplot, giving Terry the opportunity to try to manipulate each one's life. Allen does a great job in playing the role of this angry, maniplative mother but, these subplots don't congeal due to a mediocre screen play. The writer & director, Mike Binder has a supporting role as Denny's low life producer and he does a fine acting job but his screen play and direction are lacking.

633595,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JNP4,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","Showing dimensions she has not been allowed to display before onscreen, Joan Allen gives a fearless and fiercely comic performance as Terry Wolfmeyer, a suburban Detroit wife and mother of four daughters who apparently has been abandoned by her philandering husband. Director and screenwriter (as well as former stand-up comic) Mike Binder - who worked with Allen on 2000's ""The Contender"" playing her chief-of-staff - provides Allen with quite an explosive, warts-and-all showcase for her considerable acting prowess in this spirited 2005 comedy-drama.The plot seems to be an amalgam of Paul Mazursky's 1978 breakthrough ""An Unmarried Woman"", a reverse-angle take on Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", and the quirky, ironic sensibilities of Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"". However, the themes that Binder espouses are intriguing in that he explores the unremitting torrent of anger one woman feels toward life when she discovers one day that her husband is gone. As Terry deals with her anger through alcoholic binges and canoodling with Denny, the retired pro baseball neighbor, she emotionally abandons her four daughters against her best efforts.Played by Alicia Witt, oldest daughter Hadley just graduated college and becomes pregnant by an affable rich boy whom Terry describes as ""not intelligent"". Former ""Felicity"" star Keri Russell portrays aspiring ballet dancer Emily, who becomes anorexic and almost as angry as Terry. Evan Rachel Wood, superb in ""Thirteen"", plays youngest daughter ""Popeye"" (nicknamed for no explained reason), who provides the narration at the beginning and end through a class video project, while experimenting with drugs and developing a crush on a gay classmate. Rebellious Andy, portrayed by Erika Christensen, decides to get a job as a radio station production assistant rather than going to college. In the most nonchalant manner, she ends up sleeping with Shep Goodman, the sleazy producer who happens to be played by Binder. All four up-and-coming actresses are terrific within the confines of their roles.However, I have to hand the prize to Kevin Costner, who seems finally freed of the self-absorbed heroic roles he has been playing. In what has to be his most insightful performance since 1988's ""Bull Durham"", Costner plays Denny with an &eacute;lan he hasn't displayed in years. It is another baseball player role, but he infuses such humor, resignation and naked emotion into his gone-to-seed character, now a perpetually stoned disc jockey who patiently waits for Terry to see the ""upside of anger"", that sense of calm one feels in the end after all of the rage has been released. He does have a great moment when he kicks Terry's bathroom door down - rather than a romantic gesture, it summarizes the years of frustration in dealing with her paranoia and bitterness.I also appreciate how Binder realistically treats their mutual alcoholism as a way of life rather than a TV-movie disease eating away at them. There are certain times when the movie does veer toward triteness, and Binder likes to use fantasy sequences to express unspoken feelings - such as when Shep's head explodes at the dinner table to Terry's satisfaction - which are effective though a little too convenient for my taste. While not in the league of ""The Sixth Sense"", the much-discussed twist ending really makes the film more a parable about the futility of anger. It's a creative move by Binder, though it obviously prevents him from exploring the true upside of anger since it would mean explaining some story lapses.Nonetheless, this is Allen's show and she is amazing - whether collecting her husband's belonging with fury much like Jill Clayburgh did in ""An Unmarried Woman"", reacting with silent disgust as she catches Andy and Shep in bed, spooning hesitantly with Denny, ordering another Bloody Mary in front of her prospective in-laws or decking Shep twice at Hadley's wedding. The DVD includes the standard ingredients - eight deleted scenes that were understandably excised, a rather lengthy making-of featurette at over thirty minutes (although I was amazed to discover most of the film was shot in London to keep down costs), and an alternate audio commentary track by Allen and Binder, which is alternately insightful and self-congratulatory.

I think Kevin Costner is adorbable in it, and I've always loved Joan Allen.  This was one of those movies I just happened to catch by accident on cable one day and eventually ended up buying it.  The story begins with a middle-aged woman discovering her husband has abruptly run off with his secretary without a word.  As their mother selfishly wallows in her own sorrow, her four high school-aged daughters try to keep her together while more or less running the household.  Not long into the movie, she and her neighbor start a friendship, intially as drinking buddies, and things progress from there.  The focus of the story is not just on the development of their relationship, however.  It also shows the effect her own emotional roller coaster has on her relationship with her daughters.

I'm not sure if its adapted from a book but it does indeed nail that sucker for emotion in me. Joan Allen acted rather well. I dont know why a certain reviewer is praising Kevin Costner. His role isnt all that substantial and since when is playing a drunk difficult? Joan Allen's character suffers from alcahol plus broken home induced anger. Although she doesnt slap people and scream, her behaviour is erratic because she cannot digest the fact that her husband has left her. She plays the mother of four beautiful girls who lives very different lives. I fell in love with the character of Emily for it was realistic and loveable.Does the movie deserve to be purchased?I'm not quite sure on this one although I do know that anyone who's a half movie watcher would have a good time watching it. Do watch the trailer to know what to expect. This movie has no comedy and it isnt something a family would sit and watch together. However, if you are a loner like me then I suggest you watch it right away.For some reason beyond my understanding of me, my favourite scene in the film was the one where the family goes to watch a dance and are sitting in the audience.

Joan Allen plays Terry, a vodka-imbibing mother and wife who is convinced that her husband left her without a word for his Swedish secretary. There is no explanation why she would be so deadset that this is where her husband is, and no effort on her part to look for him - other than in Sweden via the Internet and directory assistance.  She is a bitter, resentful woman who is determined to vent her anger on her daughters and anyone else with whom she comes in contact.  The daughters have to deal with her irritating behavior, and when Kevin Costner (his name in the movie escapes me) comes into the picture he has to put up with her as well until he finally can't take it anymore. Though I also found myself wondering what she saw in him - a paunchy, graying former baseball player, now radio commentator.

There is some wit, Costner was actually pretty funny as again, a former baseball player--Though this is not a comedy.  Ms. Allen was good as the left wife and the rest of the cast, the daughters and the guy who played Costner's radio producer were a welcomed addition to this movie.  I enjoyed it though it was a flop at the theaters and there was a pretty good twist at the end.  Though the movie circled around bitterness and anger, hence the name, it ended happily ever after, as it wasn't a waste of my time watching.  Evan Wood who played one of Ms. Allen's daughter is an up and comer.  I see good things in her future in acting.  Ms. Allen who was really good in the Contender wasn't as sharp in this movie although she played a very articulate, well educated, bitter and angry woman.  She might not have been my first choice for her role, but she did a pretty good job.

We all take a beating sometimes it's just what happens next that matters.'The Upside Of Anger' invigourates the senses and leaves the viewer in a constant state of euphoria thoughout the entire running time of the film.So mesmerized was I to the six leads that no matter what occured onscreen I could never tear my eyes away for even a second. I was transfixed and enlightened. But anyone would feel this way when angry dialogue or objects are not propelled through the atmosphere at them at a terrific speed.So one of the things that might attract an audience apart from the stellar and always appealling cast, is the fact that while anger is displayed on the screen for viewers to observe and identify with, it is watchable because nothing is happening to us now at this very moment in the cinema seats.Kevin Costner, is back in fine form after a string of hits but mostly misses.Evan Rachel Wood gets more and more stunning as her delightful film career expands. She is always a joy to watch. She was the highlight of my movie experience.Joan Allen was remarkable. I wouldn't want to be in her sights if I got out of line. She has looks that can kill.Keri Russell is a real gem. She has lost none of the appeal that made her so terrific as Felicity Porter on 'Felicity'.

It is funny, dramatic and  profound  all at the same time. The story is well written and the chemistry between Kevin Costner and Joan Allen is magical, their performances are truly outstanding! Mike Binder is amazing too, as his  cynical and shallow character.The Upside Of Anger is in fact a movie about love. Denny Davis  (Kevin Costner) and Terry Wolfmyer (Joan Allen) are two lost souls with broken hearts who become drinking buddies and find comfort in each other's company. Gradually their friendship grows to a meaningful love. There are so many ways to say ""I love you"" but I really liked Denny Davis's  definition: ""When I am with you, and with your girls, I feel like there is a  big chunk of my life  still left to be played  out...Broken heart heals funny, you more or less walk with a limp. We'll figure out a way to be okay with it."" And  they did figure it out.The final is shocking surprise and it is beautiful. Beautiful is to watch  the affection, the closeness and the tenderness between two people who love each other deeply. It gives everyone who's heart is broken a HOPE, that the end of this painful journey  is a chance  to become a better person and to find  that ""one safe place"".""How many roads you've travelHow many dreams you've chassed,Across sand, and sky and gravelLooking for one safe place.Life is trial by fire,And love's the sweetest taste.And I pray it lifts us higherTo one safe place!""",5,Beautiful film!,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,1515,"['Upside', 'Anger', 'very', 'special', 'film', 'love', 'more', 'more', 'viewing', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'profound', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'chemistry', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'magical', 'performances', 'are', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'amazing', 'too', 'cynical', 'shallow', 'character.The', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'fact', 'movie', 'love', 'Denny', 'Davis', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Terry', 'Wolfmyer', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'are', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'broken', 'hearts', 'who', 'become', 'drinking', 'buddies', 'find', 'comfort', 'other', 'company', 'Gradually', 'friendship', 'meaningful', 'love', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'say', 'love', 'really', 'liked', 'Denny', 'Davis', 'definition', 'When', 'am', 'girls', 'feel', 'big', 'chunk', 'life', 'still', 'left', 'be', 'played', 'out', 'Broken', 'heart', 'heals', 'funny', 'more', 'less', 'walk', 'limp', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'be', 'okay', 'did', 'figure', 'out.The', 'final', 'shocking', 'surprise', 'beautiful', 'Beautiful', 'watch', 'affection', 'closeness', 'tenderness', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'deeply', 'everyone', 'who', 'heart', 'broken', 'HOPE', 'end', 'painful', 'journey', 'chance', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'find', 'one', 'safe', 'place', 'How', 'many', 'roads', ""'ve"", 'travelHow', 'many', 'dreams', ""'ve"", 'chassed', 'Across', 'sand', 'sky', 'gravelLooking', 'one', 'safe', 'place.Life', 'trial', 'fire', 'love', 'sweetest', 'taste.And', 'pray', 'higherTo', 'one', 'safe', 'place']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)

His performance is the only thing that keeps this movie afloat, and even WITH his performance, it's a mess.Joan Allen's performance seems phoned-in at best.  Those who've seen this lady in action know what to expect.  Her anger/despair thing feels very superficial and seem to exist only at the surface.Meanwhile her daughters are a total enigma.  Their characters are given one or two notes and nothing more.  The information we get about them is doled out in unfinished bits and incredibly boring pieces.  It was unclear even at the end of the movie exactly what the age line-up was for the girls.  We knew the oldest & the youngest, but that was it.  (The fact that Keri Russell is actually OLDER than the actress playing the oldest girl didn't help things there.)  It was also unclear what their real feelings towards their parents' situation really was and the passage of time didn't seem to have much of an effect on what was going on in most of their lives.  The events of the movie supposedly take place over three years, but in the end that didn't make a great deal of sense in the context of things.  It was also unclear why one of the girls was actually named ""Popeye.""The movie begins with what has to be hands down the WORST movie voice-over of ALL TIME.  It's hideously written and delivered very poorly by Evan Rachel Wood -- an actress I frankly expected more from, given her stellar performance in ""Thirteen"" a couple of years ago.  Alas, the fault in this movie lies mostly in the material.

She drowns herself in booze and anger and leaves her four daughters in exasperated confusion as she flounders around trying to make sense of a new life without her husband.

Her only solace is her next-door neighbor, a former professional baseball player (Kevin Costner) who offers her companionship and understanding.

633610,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNP4,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 7]","On occasion, an archipelago offers a metaphorical illustration for the human race in regards to relationships, as each island represents a human being.  In this metaphor the islands are dormant, unwilling to move, and only every 100 millennia these islands might bump into each other, as continental shifts sluggishly move great distances over a vast amount of time.  Thus, the water between the islands gives the impression of infinite distances, even though the physical distance might only be a mere foot.  Only an intangible source could generate such an elusive distance within human beings.  The director Mike Binder explores the notion of intangible distance within a broken family through his The Upside of Anger.Mike Binder does not waste any time in illustrating any complex ideas of how and what could possible create an endless distance within a family.  In the first scene, the daughter Lavender (Evan Rachel Wood), also known as Popeye, states, ""A case in point in anger's ability to change us is my mother.""  Through Popeye's statement, Binder verbally and visually focuses the attention to the mother, Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen).  Through Terry, an obvious sentiment emerges, anger in the form of a cold and merciless resentment, which she continuously tries to control in the haze of vodka.  Despite Terry's concentrated efforts to bottle up her feelings with alcohol, her resentment seeps through her tightly shut bottleneck, as everyone of any relation to her falls victim to her anguishing well-managed rage at the most awkward moments.After the opening where Terry and Popeye ride in the back of a limousine together with former baseball pro Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) to a funeral, the story jumps back three years.  Through this extensive flashback, the audience learns that Terry's husband Gray has left her for a young and beautiful Swedish secretary, which also seems to be the root for her anger.  Her neighbor Denny soon learns about Gray's departure, and invites himself into the home of the Wolfmeyer's with the help of his manipulative charm.  Together Terry and Denny become drinking buddies, as Denny also tries to drown the feeling of being a has-been.  Nonetheless, Denny and Terry get closer to one another while Terry's resentment and anger flare up in the most inappropriate moments where she ends up hurting her daughters emotionally.The absence of the father Gray has shaken the Wolfmeyer family to the core, as he never has attempted to contact them.  The neglect from the father furthers the emotional pain within the daughters who also must deal with their resentful mother.  It has also hurt Terry, as she never got the opportunity to get closure to her relationship with Gray.  Terry and her daughters have merely been left in an unfeeling no-mans land that is occasionally lightened up by the presence of Denny.  Nonetheless, the daughters also find their own struggles such as getting married, post-high school educational decisions, and the people that the daughters date adds to Terry's anger, which sporadically flares up in small explosions.The Upside of Anger is a film that resembles two recent films Imaginary Heroes (2004) and Garden State (2004) in regards to the cold and detached atmosphere in the film.  There is also some likeness with Little Women (1994), but regardless of the similarities with other films Binder succeeds in making a unique story that touches the audience.  The story delivers a dissection of anger in a woman who ends up hurting those she loves.  However, it is not the tearjerker that many might anticipate, but the film delivers several thoughtful messages worth pondering, as people try to reach across the water between the islands.",4,A Drama Worthy of Further Reflection...,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,3721,"['occasion', 'archipelago', 'metaphorical', 'illustration', 'human', 'race', 'regards', 'relationships', 'island', 'human', 'being', 'metaphor', 'islands', 'are', 'dormant', 'unwilling', 'move', 'only', '100', 'millennia', 'islands', 'might', 'bump', 'other', 'continental', 'shifts', 'sluggishly', 'move', 'great', 'distances', 'vast', 'amount', 'time', 'Thus', 'water', 'islands', 'impression', 'infinite', 'distances', 'even', 'physical', 'distance', 'might', 'only', 'be', 'mere', 'foot', 'Only', 'intangible', 'source', 'could', 'generate', 'elusive', 'distance', 'human', 'beings', 'director', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'notion', 'intangible', 'distance', 'broken', 'family', 'Upside', 'Anger.Mike', 'Binder', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'illustrating', 'complex', 'ideas', 'how', 'what', 'could', 'possible', 'create', 'endless', 'distance', 'family', 'first', 'scene', 'daughter', 'Lavender', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'also', 'known', 'Popeye', 'case', 'point', 'anger', 'ability', 'change', 'mother', 'Popeye', 'statement', 'Binder', 'verbally', 'visually', 'attention', 'mother', 'Terry', 'Wolfmeyer', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Terry', 'obvious', 'sentiment', 'emerges', 'anger', 'form', 'cold', 'merciless', 'resentment', 'continuously', 'control', 'haze', 'vodka', 'Terry', 'concentrated', 'efforts', 'bottle', 'up', 'feelings', 'alcohol', 'resentment', 'seeps', 'tightly', 'shut', 'bottleneck', 'everyone', 'relation', 'falls', 'victim', 'anguishing', 'well-managed', 'rage', 'most', 'awkward', 'moments.After', 'opening', 'where', 'Terry', 'Popeye', 'ride', 'back', 'limousine', 'together', 'former', 'baseball', 'pro', 'Denny', 'Davies', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'funeral', 'story', 'back', 'three', 'years', 'extensive', 'flashback', 'audience', 'Terry', 'husband', 'Gray', 'left', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Swedish', 'secretary', 'also', 'be', 'root', 'anger', 'neighbor', 'Denny', 'soon', 'Gray', 'departure', 'home', 'Wolfmeyer', 'help', 'manipulative', 'charm', 'Terry', 'Denny', 'become', 'drinking', 'buddies', 'Denny', 'also', 'drown', 'feeling', 'being', 'has-been', 'Nonetheless', 'Denny', 'Terry', 'get', 'closer', 'one', 'while', 'Terry', 'resentment', 'anger', 'flare', 'up', 'most', 'inappropriate', 'moments', 'where', 'up', 'hurting', 'daughters', 'emotionally.The', 'absence', 'father', 'Gray', 'shaken', 'Wolfmeyer', 'family', 'core', 'never', 'attempted', 'contact', 'neglect', 'father', 'emotional', 'pain', 'daughters', 'who', 'also', 'must', 'deal', 'resentful', 'mother', 'also', 'hurt', 'Terry', 'never', 'got', 'opportunity', 'get', 'closure', 'relationship', 'Gray', 'Terry', 'daughters', 'have', 'merely', 'been', 'left', 'unfeeling', 'no-mans', 'land', 'occasionally', 'lightened', 'up', 'presence', 'Denny', 'Nonetheless', 'daughters', 'also', 'find', 'own', 'struggles', 'such', 'getting', 'married', 'post-high', 'school', 'educational', 'decisions', 'people', 'daughters', 'date', 'Terry', 'anger', 'sporadically', 'up', 'small', 'explosions.The', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'film', 'two', 'recent', 'films', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', '2004', 'Garden', 'State', '2004', 'regards', 'cold', 'detached', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'also', 'likeness', 'Little', 'Women', '1994', 'regardless', 'similarities', 'other', 'films', 'Binder', 'making', 'unique', 'story', 'audience', 'story', 'dissection', 'anger', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'hurting', 'However', 'not', 'tearjerker', 'many', 'might', 'anticipate', 'film', 'delivers', 'several', 'thoughtful', 'messages', 'pondering', 'people', 'try', 'reach', 'water', 'islands']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)

633612,A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ,B00005JNP4,Larry Scantlebury,"[2, 3]","Stallone's response to Burt Young's question 'what do you see in my sister?' (Talia Shire) is kind of like Costner, drifting in an alcoholic fugue, the glory days as a Detroit Tiger (Denny McClain?) over, with the horribly emotionally wounded Joan Allen.This movie is reminiscent of the Diane Lane ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" story several years back. I found ""Anger"" much more engaging and was frankly bored by ""Tuscan Sun.""Part of that is due to Allen's brilliance and her ability to do more with what she was given than Lane was. And, frankly, Costner is better now aging than he was before saving the world and being heroic. I liked ""For the Love of the Game"" and I thought ""Open Range"" was one of the best westerns ever made.Here we deal with Allen's anger and the impact it has on her four daughters ranging from 15 to I imagine 23-24. Mike Binder knows that anger is like a drug and like a drug it allows us destructive self-pity and the excuse for not changing.Why Allen's husband disappeared is almost irrevelant as her rage is so close to the surface. That rage fuels the first 3/4ths of the movie.Costner plays sort of a sounding board and his accptance by the daughters as a friend-father-figure comes really earlier than his acceptance by Allen as a partner and a friend.My only criticism is that Binder does too much with the issues. The acting talents of the daughters are never really used and they drift from one crisis to another. Allen's 'my life just fell apart so let me be a psycho-witch' becomes tedious and her explosions, while brilliantly acted, causes one to wonder if her husband had the right idea.All of which is a credit to Allen and her own range. Here's a note on Costner. In both ""Open Range"" and ""Anger"" he acts a secondary role with brilliant actors (Duvall; Allen) and they draw from him his own deep talent. 4 stars.

633613,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005JNP4,Larry VanDeSande,"[6, 6]","Joan Allen's riveting yet restrained performance lends a big assist to this dramedy about social and subruban manners circa 2005. Allen plays protagonist to Kevin Costner's antagonist in this film about divorce, bitterness, alcoholism, readjusted family life and, finally, great surprise.Allen plays affluent suburbanite Terry Wolfmeyer who takes to drinking and bitterness when her husband leaves home, seemingly on a permanent basis, for what she thinks is his secretary. She soons develops a friendship with neighobr Denny Davies (Kostner), a washed up old ball player) who likes to drink and has a radio talk show in Detroit. Their friendship moves in a predicatble direction that keeps the plot from being as interesting as Allen's wonderful performance.The film is greatly abetted by actresses playing Allen's four daughters -- Alicia Witt, Keri Russell, Erika Christensen and Evan Rachel Wood -- two of whom are out of high school and two still carrying out late adolescence. The girls' lives are also very interesting and help the viewer stay connected with the enveloping emotions of the film.This movie won no awards but was more interesting and rewarding than a lot of Oscar winning and nominated flicks I've seen in recent years. There is affect from ""American Beauty"", ""Ordinary People"" and ""Terms of Endearment"", Oscar winners to which this film readily compares.

633615,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNP4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[15, 15]","When her husband's secretary goes back to Sweden and then her husband disappears, Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) puts two and two together.  As far as Terry is concerned, her husband no longer exists and is dead to her and their four daughters.  At the start of ""The Upside of Anger"" Terry is not so much angry as she is drunk.  When next door neighbor and former baseball player Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) finds out about Terry's situation, both the news that her husband is gone and the fact that she is drinking all of the time, he walks into her house and into her life.  Denny's reasons for doing so are not clear.  He could just be looking for a new drinking partner, or he could be recognizing a person whose life has just crumbled beneath then.  Then again, maybe he just wants sex.  But when Terry decides she just wants sex, Denny flees, so we have to think there is more going on.The relationship between Terry and Denny is the main plotline of ""The Upside of Anger,"" but in addition to the missing husband and deciding what is up with this new man suddenly in her life, Terry has to deal with four daughters.  Hadley (Alicia Witt) is about to graduate college and has a double-dose of news for her mother.  Andy (Erika Christensen) does not want to go to college and just wants to work, which is also news for Terry.  Emily (Keri Russell) is a dancer who wants to go to a small arts college, ideas that Terry disparages.  Then there is ""Popeye"" (Evan Rachel Wood), real name Lavender, who is the narrator of the film in those few instances where we cannot be told a profound thought any other way.  It is hard enough for Terry to deal with being an abandoned wife without her daughter's throwing an increasingly frustrating number of new monkey wrenches into her life as well.  Consequently, there are moments where the dialogue gives way to inarticulate grunts and a particular memorable death wish daydream at the family dining room table.I do not have a problem with the conclusion put together by writer-director Mike Binder (""The Sex Monster,"" ""The Search for John Gissing"").  Since I have the firm conviction that irony is the master trope of the universe, I appreciate the twist at the end of this one.  Furthermore, I think that it underscores the message of the film, a conclusion I reached before I did the extras on this DVD and found out precisely what Binder says is his thesis proposition.  Binder wrote the script specifically for Allen, so it is not surprising that her performance is on point, but Costner is equally as good in what is essentially a supporting role (his best moments are when he wins ""Popeye"" over and kicks down the bathroom door).  It is not surprising that the four young actresses basically jumped on board because they wanted to work with Joan Allen (clearly there is a big upside to doing so).My main complaint with this movie ends up being that it does not have enough deleted scenes.  Dealing with what is happening between Terry and Denny is enough without trying to provide equal time to all four of the daughters.  After all, it is not like this is adopted from a novel that you can go read after the fact to find out more about the characters.  Binder wrote a script and not a novel, so this is all there is and there ain't no more.  But I wish there was because it is the complexity of Terry's relationship with her daughters and how they all deal with Denny and the absent father.  ""The Upside of Anger"" feels like it has the depth of a novel, which is a pretty good compliment for a movie of this sort.Plus, you have to like any writer-director who writes a script in which his leading lady gets to slap him not only around but actually all the way down to the groud.  The fact that Binder filmed this story, set in a Detroit suburb, at the Ealing Studios in London, is also impressive.  Now the big question is whether the Academy will remember Joan Allen at Oscar time, because she should at least get a nomination out of this one (her performance is certainly better than all five of last year's nominees).",5,A fable about what a waste of time anger is,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,4070,"['When', 'husband', 'secretary', 'back', 'Sweden', 'then', 'husband', 'disappears', 'Terry', 'Wolfmeyer', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'As', 'far', 'Terry', 'concerned', 'husband', 'no', 'longer', 'exists', 'dead', 'four', 'daughters', 'start', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'Terry', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'angry', 'drunk', 'When', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'former', 'baseball', 'player', 'Denny', 'Davies', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'out', 'Terry', 'situation', 'news', 'husband', 'gone', 'fact', 'drinking', 'time', 'house', 'life', 'Denny', 'reasons', 'doing', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'clear', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'looking', 'new', 'drinking', 'partner', 'could', 'be', 'recognizing', 'person', 'life', 'just', 'crumbled', 'beneath', 'then', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'just', 'sex', 'when', 'Terry', 'just', 'sex', 'Denny', 'flees', 'have', 'think', 'more', 'going', 'on.The', 'relationship', 'Terry', 'Denny', 'main', 'plotline', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'addition', 'missing', 'husband', 'deciding', 'what', 'up', 'new', 'man', 'suddenly', 'life', 'Terry', 'deal', 'four', 'daughters', 'Hadley', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'graduate', 'college', 'double-dose', 'news', 'mother', 'Andy', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'college', 'just', 'work', 'also', 'news', 'Terry', 'Emily', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'dancer', 'who', 'go', 'small', 'arts', 'college', 'ideas', 'Terry', 'disparages', 'Then', 'Popeye', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'real', 'name', 'Lavender', 'who', 'narrator', 'film', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'profound', 'thought', 'other', 'way', 'hard', 'enough', 'Terry', 'deal', 'being', 'abandoned', 'wife', 'daughter', 'throwing', 'increasingly', 'frustrating', 'number', 'new', 'monkey', 'wrenches', 'life', 'well', 'Consequently', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'dialogue', 'way', 'inarticulate', 'grunts', 'particular', 'memorable', 'death', 'wish', 'daydream', 'family', 'dining', 'room', 'table.I', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'conclusion', 'put', 'together', 'writer-director', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'Sex', 'Monster', 'Search', 'John', 'Gissing', 'have', 'firm', 'conviction', 'irony', 'master', 'trope', 'universe', 'appreciate', 'twist', 'end', 'one', 'think', 'message', 'film', 'conclusion', 'reached', 'did', 'extras', 'DVD', 'found', 'out', 'precisely', 'what', 'Binder', 'thesis', 'proposition', 'Binder', 'wrote', 'script', 'specifically', 'Allen', 'not', 'surprising', 'performance', 'point', 'Costner', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'what', 'essentially', 'supporting', 'role', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Popeye', 'kicks', 'down', 'bathroom', 'door', 'not', 'surprising', 'four', 'young', 'actresses', 'basically', 'jumped', 'board', 'wanted', 'work', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'clearly', 'big', 'upside', 'doing', 'so', '.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Dealing', 'what', 'happening', 'Terry', 'Denny', 'enough', 'trying', 'provide', 'equal', 'time', 'four', 'daughters', 'not', 'adopted', 'novel', 'can', 'go', 'read', 'fact', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'characters', 'Binder', 'wrote', 'script', 'not', 'novel', 'ai', ""n't"", 'no', 'more', 'wish', 'there', 'was', 'complexity', 'Terry', 'relationship', 'daughters', 'how', 'deal', 'Denny', 'absent', 'father', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'feels', 'depth', 'novel', 'pretty', 'good', 'compliment', 'movie', 'sort.Plus', 'have', 'like', 'writer-director', 'who', 'script', 'leading', 'lady', 'slap', 'not', 'only', 'around', 'actually', 'way', 'groud', 'fact', 'Binder', 'filmed', 'story', 'set', 'Detroit', 'suburb', 'Ealing', 'Studios', 'London', 'also', 'impressive', 'Now', 'big', 'question', 'Academy', 'will', 'remember', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Oscar', 'time', 'should', 'least', 'get', 'nomination', 'one', 'performance', 'certainly', 'better', 'five', 'last', 'year', 'nominees']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)
633616,ATNQJL1SF21TS,B00005JNP4,"lb136 ""lb136""","[3, 3]","2005's ""Upside of Anger,"" missed out during the awards season; and it didn't do well at the boxoffice. But don't pass it by. It features a chilling performance by Joan Allen as a boozy abandoned stay-at-home wife (her husband has apparently left for Sweden with his assistant), and a great comeback performance by Kevin Costner as her neighbor, who plays a beer-buzzed ex-baseball player turned radio dj (he's been hired to talk about baseball but he doesn't want to).The scene where Costner first learns Allen's husband has abandoned her is a hoot. He arrives at her door, beercan in hand, to discuss the idea of turning those tulgy woods behind their property into a subdevelopment, and things progress bizarrely on from there, as the ill-matched pair end up making each other comfortable, and finally they're at least embarked on the road to happiness.The supporting cast is great, too. Allen has four daughters, superbly played by (from oldest to youngest) Alicia Witt, Keri Russell (""Felicity""), Erika Christiansen (""Traffic""), and Evan Rachel Wood (""Pretty Persuasion""). Each has a memorable scene or two or three. Director Mike Binder turns up as Kostner's not quite pervy producer. He overdoes the sleazebag bit, but maybe that's the point.Beware! The film begins (and ends) with one of those pseudo-significant voiceover narrations (by Wood) and a funeral scene (in the rain, of course). That might make you roll back your eyes and hit the eject button. But don't do it! There's a quick flashback to three years before, and when the action starts, you begin to realize that you haven't seen all of the characters you're now introduced to among the mourners. And so, with the various crises that develop along the way, you begin to ponder who among the others was being buried.When you find out, it's quite a shock.",4,Underrated Gem,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1823,"['2005', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'missed', 'out', 'awards', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'boxoffice', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'chilling', 'performance', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'boozy', 'abandoned', 'stay-at-home', 'wife', 'husband', 'apparently', 'left', 'Sweden', 'assistant', 'great', 'comeback', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'neighbor', 'who', 'beer-buzzed', 'ex-baseball', 'player', 'turned', 'radio', 'dj', 'been', 'hired', 'talk', 'baseball', ""n't"", 'want', '.The', 'scene', 'where', 'Costner', 'first', 'Allen', 'husband', 'abandoned', 'hoot', 'door', 'beercan', 'hand', 'discuss', 'idea', 'turning', 'tulgy', 'woods', 'property', 'subdevelopment', 'things', 'progress', 'bizarrely', 'there', 'ill-matched', 'pair', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'other', 'comfortable', 'finally', ""'re"", 'least', 'embarked', 'road', 'happiness.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'too', 'Allen', 'four', 'daughters', 'superbly', 'played', 'oldest', 'youngest', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Felicity', 'Erika', 'Christiansen', 'Traffic', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Pretty', 'Persuasion', 'memorable', 'scene', 'two', 'three', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'up', 'Kostner', 'not', 'quite', 'pervy', 'producer', 'sleazebag', 'bit', 'maybe', 'point.Beware', 'film', 'one', 'pseudo-significant', 'voiceover', 'narrations', 'Wood', 'funeral', 'scene', 'rain', 'course', 'might', 'make', 'roll', 'back', 'eyes', 'hit', 'eject', 'button', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'quick', 'flashback', 'three', 'years', 'when', 'action', 'begin', 'realize', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'characters', ""'re"", 'now', 'introduced', 'mourners', 'so', 'various', 'crises', 'develop', 'way', 'begin', 'ponder', 'who', 'others', 'was', 'being', 'buried.When', 'find', 'out', 'quite', 'shock']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)
633617,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JNP4,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 5]","I went to the movie theatre expecting a good film and became mesmerized.  I went back again with my daughter for a second time and now have the DVD.  My jaw drops with HOW good this movie is.  Director Mike Binder who was in ""Minority Report"" as an actor and who wrote the screenplay does an amazing job with the dialogue.  It's framed by some very literate narration from the young daughter Popeye played by Evan Rachel Wood from TV's ""Once & Again"" series.Joan Allen's performance is brilliant.  She is so angry and depressed and achieves such comedy that it's amazing she didn't walk away with a gold statuette at the Oscars.  She is so self-absorbed and delights in it so that everyone around her must pay attention.  When she goes to meet daughter Hadley's new in-laws she downs Bloody Marys like they were Pepsi-Colas and says, ""Well, at least you're not Jewish.""  It's the quintessential inappropriate remark and later causes her to describe herself as the poster child for alcohol prevention.  The costumer who puts her in the flowing nightgowns in the bedroom as she rips her husband's clothes out of the closet and his pictures off the wall is brilliant.  While most of the film's expressionistic flourishes fell on the cutting room floor in the deleted scenes, the one brilliant moment is when Shep slurps soup and his head suddenly explodes.  The deleted scenes show a fantasy sequence where Joan Allen's Terry has murdered her husband and his cheating partner and the bloody husband's corpse comes back to complain.  Terry looks at him with one of those icy stares and then punches his bloody hacked head.  It is hysterical!Her comedy plays off of a brilliant Kevin Costner performance as a former baseball star who seeks a life after baseball.  His giddy little expressions as he intrudes on her shower and offers her a drink are priceless.  After he makes love, he lays back and looks like the happiest man on the planet.The supporting actors are excellent.  In addition to Wood as Popeye, TV's Felicity, Keri Russell, plays Emily who longs to dance, but who the mother shuts down as being unrealistic.  Her illness and Terry's rushing to her side show even more levels of caring, tenderness, and gives the mother character a perspective on her own difficulties.  Erika Christensen from ""Swimfan"" and ""Flight Plan"" does an excellent job as Andy who doesn't want to go to college and gets a job as a production assistant at the radio station.  Her affair with middle-aged Shep is hilarious, especially when Terry discovers them in bed and is so furious words will not even form on her lips over the intense rage she feels.  Alicia Witt who was in ""Vanilla Sky"" plays the older daughter Hadley who marries and has several babies in the course of the film.  Dane Christensen plays Popeye's friend Gordon who she hits on, only to find out he's gay.  His bungi-jumping scene through their plate glass window is hysterical for the nonverbal reactions from Joan Allen.I also found the theme of the movie to be profound.  Anger is an emotion that many experience.  Controlling it, channeling it and focusing in ways that don't hurt those around us is an important lesson that some never learn.  As an actress, Joan Allen expresses her rage so exquisitely that we both laugh & cry.  This will be a film I will pull out from time to time as one of my all-time favorites.

There is no exception with Costner here (which is why there is one star missing).  The real credit goes to Joan Allen.  It's easy to have a love/hate relationship with her character and Allen does such a fine job of pulling this off.  Her character is neurotic, depressed, and anxious and I think Joan Allen should have gotten an Oscar nod for Best Actress, replacing Judi Dench in Mrs. Henderson Presents who only got the Oscar nod because she is a bit more respectible in Hollywood.

Joan Allen is as always marvelous as Terry, a middle-aged wife whose husband vanishes from their life, apparently running off to Sweden with his assistant.  He leaves Allen with four attractive daughters who have their own personal demons:  Erika Christensen as a spritely young girl who eschews college to seek a job as a production assistant for a smarmy radio producer (director Mike Binder in an engaging performance); Keri Russell as a dancing hopeful who lets stress and dieting almost end her chances; Alicia Witt as a strong-willed daughter who finds herself married and pregnant upon her college graduation; and fifteen year old Evan Rachel Wood who falls for a [...] guy and is doing her own documentary on violence and anger.  In a career rejuvenating role, Kevin Costner is great as a baseball star who integrates his way into Allen and her daughters lives.  All this is well and good, but the movie doesn't offer any information as to the disintegration of Allen's marriage and Allen actually isn't a very likeable mother or character.

633623,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JNP4,mirasreviews,"[21, 21]","Terry Wolfmeyer was, in her daughter's words, the ""sweetest, nicest, woman that anyone who knew her ever knew"". That is, until her husband ran off with his secretary leaving her with 4 cheeky daughters, a lovely suburban Detroit home, and a lot of self-pity. ""Then things changed. And she changed. She got angry. Good and angry."" Terry (Joan Allen) turns herself into an embittered lush and has an affair with an equally drunk neighbor Denny Davies (Kevin Costner). Denny's an affable, easy-going ex-pro baseball player who trades on his former glory to make a living. Terry is of the opposite temperament: controlling, intense, and self-important, so they make quite a pair. Preoccupied with her husband's rejection and using her victimhood to excuse all manner of outrageous behavior, Terry still finds time to be appalled by her eldest daughter Hadley's (Alicia Witt) marriage, her ballet dancer daughter Emily's (Keri Russell) choice of career, and other daughter Andy's (Erika Christensen) boyfriend. Only the youngest of the family, Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood), escapes her venom.The key to enjoying ""The Upside of Anger"" is to understand that it is a black comedy. The film's fault is that that is not obvious. The humor in Terry's behavior is clear, but it's always played straight, which sometimes makes it difficult to know if we are watching a comedy or a tragedy. The film's tone is inscrutable. It has a sense of humor, but at the same time is consumed by Terry's anger. Terry seems to have everything in the world except  a husband, whom she apparently didn't love anyway. Her life is remarkably unchanged by his abandonment. Yet she never ceases to feel sorry for herself, and she tries to keep such a tight reign on everyone around her that we feel she might crack. Terry is sympathetic only up to a point. Fortunately, writer/director Mike Binder sensed the limit of our sympathy and made the characters act accordingly.Even if we're unsure of how we should take Terry Wolfmeyer, this is one of Joan Allen's most memorable performances, and that's saying a lot. Terry is overbearing, seems to resent her daughters' happiness and successes, and goes out of her way to find something to criticize. But she is cognizant of her own foibles. She is also possessed of a fierce love for her children, even if they wish they saw more of the love and less of the fierce. All of the characters are self-aware and refreshingly forthright. Mike Binder has written a smart film with impressively sharp dialogue. -And he is fantastically funny in the role of Andie's lecherous older boyfriend Shep. Like Terry, Shep is a alternately sympathetic/repulsive/hilarious character who is, nonetheless, blunt and insightful no matter what he does. Denny Davies is Kevin Costner's best role in years, a tolerant, caring, slacker-ish neighbor who is brighter than he seems. Denny and Terry's boozy relationship is certainly entertaining and gives the film an element of romantic comedy. The audience can choose to take ""The Upside of Anger"" as seriously or as lightly as it wants. The film's greatest strength may be in the fact that it is simultaneously very funny and very true. But it's never dumb.The DVD (New Line 2005): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer, 8 deleted scenes, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), a making-of documentary, and an audio commentary. ""Creating the Upside of Anger"" (27 minutes) features interviews with the cast, producers, and writer/director/actor Mike Binder. Binder discusses writing the film for Joan Allen and getting it made. Actors discuss each other, characters, and filming. There is some information on Mike Binder's career. This documentary should have been edited down, but there is some interesting info. The audio commentary is by Mike Binder and Joan Allen, moderated by Rod Lurie. It starts off as a prolonged mutual admiration society but does eventually move on to discuss characters, themes, and talk a great deal about decisions in writing the film. Binder does at one point address the comedy-drama genre confusion. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.",4,"Black Comedy or Poignant Drama?

Terry (Joan Allen) discovers that her husband has left her, presumably to run off to Sweden with his young secretary. In response, she goes on a boozy, angry binge and gets in touch with her inner bitch. Denny (Kevin Costner), Terry's neighbor and a washed-up baseball star, is only too happy to join in the alcohol-soaked pity party, and the two misery-loving drinking buddies find themselves drawn to one another. Costner and Allen were both amazing in this movie. I must admit, I had almost written Costner off after I saw several of his movies that did nothing for me. But in The Upside of Anger, he proves that he's still got it. Allen, who can sometimes come off on screen as a bit too repressed and buttoned up (a quality that made her perfect in Pleasantville), really lets loose here.I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the director didn't throw away the roles of Terry's dughters on actresses who weren't up to the challenge. Erika Christensen, Alicia Witt, Keri Russell, and Evan Rachel Wood all turn in strong performances. The movie seems to explore both love and anger, with some interesting conclusions drawn via the character of Popeye (don't ask me where they got the name), one of Terry's daughters.

633628,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JNP4,Only-A-Child,"[0, 0]","After her performance in ""The Ice Storm"" it is no surprise that Joan Allen could carry a movie like ""The Upside of Anger"". Nor was it a surprise that she and Alicia Witt could beautifully play off each other in their confrontational mother and daughter roles. What did surprise was that the film featured equally strong performances from the other members of the cast. Even writer/director Mike Binder does a fine ""on-screen"" job as a slimy but not entirely unsympathetic radio producer. Kevin Costner would be wise to stay with this type of role (and with comedy) instead of big-budget epic stuff.The casting of Witt with Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, and Keri Russell as the four sisters was inspired. It was refreshing just to see a film family that looked enough alike physically to actually be related to each other. Since Christensen looks so much like Julia Stiles they could have even added a fifth sister although their resemblance is so strong that it might be confusing. All the subtle birth order distinctions felt right. The oldest (Witt) was the most connected to mom even though it did not appear so on the surface. The second (Christensen-who absolutely glows on the screen) was determined to be different than her older sister. The third (Russell) was the most connected to the father, missed him the most, and had the least understanding of the mother. The youngest (Wood) was way ahead of the curve and the most perceptive character in the film. Watch for all this stuff because it is there, and watch how no matter how down the mother becomes she continues to monitor the welfare of her daughters.Binder gave into the temptation to use cheesy special effect gimmicks several times (the explosion at the dinner table, the neighborhood transition from summer to winter, the ballet fantasy, and the daughters growing older during the funeral scene). Although done well they seemed out of place. Also Binder should review the Kent State shootings, there were four students killed-not six.There is a spectacular shot at the wedding. Beginning as an over the shoulder shot of Hadley (Witt) sucking in her ""plump"" cheeks, the camera pans slightly right and moves toward the wedding party as the focus changes to bring them out of a blur.The film's ironic twist in the last 15 minutes is borrowed wholesale from ""Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice"". I particularly liked Wood's beautiful narration which helped clarify the title and theme, necessary (or at least helpful) after this ironic story line twist. She managed to sound both detached and involved, it is actually the voice-over for her broadcasting class project. When we are suddenly forced to reevaluate everything that has gone before in what we thought was just an interesting comedy, Wood steps in and steers us to internalize the theme. They go out on a shot of Wood looking up from her Mac and smiling. Amazing.This is the best of Binder's writing: ""Anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks. That's what I know now. It needs nothing to burn but the air and the life that it swallows and smothers. It's real though, the fury, even when it isn't. It can change you, turn you, mold you and shape you into something you're not. The only upside of anger then, is the person you become, hopefully someone that wakes up one day and realizes they're not afraid of its journey. Someone that knows that the truth is, at best, a partially told story. That anger, like growth, comes in spurts and fits and in its wake leaves a new chance of acceptance and the promise of calm"".""The Upside of Anger"" is one of those rare films that I believe everyone should make an effort to connect with, doing so will make you a better person.

It is a shame that none of them is conscious of how different most of people live their lives, of how furtunate they are.

The film is very conservative in its morals: to go out with a young girl is bad, to run with your Swedish secretary is bad (is better to be dead); but strangely, for the young daughter to take advantage of an older man in her profession is OK.

The director, the star of HBO's funny but short-lived ""Mind of the married man,"" plays as an excellent counterpoint to Costner's well-worn retired jock persona, the drunk with a heart of gold and the hottest mom in town as his neighbor.This is no chick flick, but it is a tribute to Joan Allen, the star Binder wrote the script to feature. Binder gives her a wonderful role, both troubled and joyous, both wounded and strong, as an abandoned mom surrounded by four beautiful but troubled young women. Clearly, they get it from their mom: their looks, their talents, their neuroses. And you have to like them all, and empathize with them and their plight as Allen finds herself alone in a big house, with no explanation, just the sudden disappearence of her husband, supposedly on the lam with his hot young Nordic secretary.And you have to ask: Who would give up on Allen? Yes, she is a bit repressed by her upper-class life and her desire to motivate, manage and love her daughters, but she is so lovely, long-limbed and unintentionally charming that you have to ask: Who was this idiot husband? Binder, as Shep, is not much help here. He plays a most unattractive media stereotype, seducing a daughter with an internship and appearing totally clueless as to the scorn he deserves and gets from the mother. Shep's ability to ingratiate himself into this struggling family had to leave Allen asking herself repeatedly: Where did I go wrong? Only we all know, and by the end we confirm, that it is not her fault, and she did nothing wrong.Costner slowly and not-so-weasily works his way into Allen's new life, balancing his obvious lust for her agaisnt her own anxieties and the disapproving looks of the four concerned daughters. But his method works, and you have to give Costner and Allen credit for re-establing some semblance of a meaningful life in the middle of all of the problems that surround them, from Costner's drinking, to Allen's abandonment, to the trials and tribulations of the four daughters.The film offers a wonderful, quite unexpected turn at the end. It would be cruel to reveal its nature and even more cruel to criticize it as a little too smarmy. This climax certainly caught me off guard, just as this entire film caught me pleasantly by surprise. Binder wrote Allen a great role; she deserved it, and more. She is a gift left unopened all too long. This is not a classic film, nor is it a truly great film, but it is an enjoyable, admirable one, made all the more rewarding by the recent inability of Hollywood to make and market anything of enduring value.",5,Not a chick flick at all,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,2746,"['Immersed', 'film', 'listening', 'Shep', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'lecherous', 'producer', 'hidden', 'scraggly', 'beard', 'took', 'time', 'recognize', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'director', 'star', 'HBO', 'funny', 'short-lived', 'Mind', 'married', 'man', 'excellent', 'counterpoint', 'Costner', 'well-worn', 'retired', 'jock', 'persona', 'drunk', 'heart', 'gold', 'hottest', 'mom', 'town', 'neighbor.This', 'chick', 'flick', 'tribute', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'star', 'Binder', 'wrote', 'script', 'feature', 'Binder', 'wonderful', 'role', 'troubled', 'joyous', 'wounded', 'strong', 'abandoned', 'mom', 'surrounded', 'four', 'beautiful', 'troubled', 'young', 'women', 'Clearly', 'get', 'mom', 'looks', 'talents', 'neuroses', 'have', 'like', 'empathize', 'plight', 'Allen', 'alone', 'big', 'house', 'explanation', 'just', 'sudden', 'disappearence', 'husband', 'supposedly', 'lam', 'hot', 'young', 'Nordic', 'secretary.And', 'have', 'ask', 'Who', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'Allen', 'Yes', 'bit', 'repressed', 'upper-class', 'life', 'desire', 'motivate', 'manage', 'love', 'daughters', 'so', 'lovely', 'long-limbed', 'unintentionally', 'charming', 'have', 'ask', 'Who', 'was', 'idiot', 'husband', 'Binder', 'Shep', 'not', 'much', 'help', 'here', 'most', 'unattractive', 'media', 'stereotype', 'seducing', 'daughter', 'internship', 'appearing', 'totally', 'clueless', 'scorn', 'mother', 'Shep', 'ability', 'ingratiate', 'struggling', 'family', 'had', 'leave', 'Allen', 'asking', 'repeatedly', 'Where', 'did', 'go', 'wrong', 'Only', 'know', 'end', 'confirm', 'not', 'fault', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong.Costner', 'slowly', 'not-so-weasily', 'way', 'Allen', 'new', 'life', 'balancing', 'obvious', 'lust', 'agaisnt', 'own', 'anxieties', 'disapproving', 'looks', 'four', 'concerned', 'daughters', 'method', 'works', 'have', 'give', 'Costner', 'Allen', 'credit', 're-establing', 'semblance', 'meaningful', 'life', 'middle', 'problems', 'surround', 'Costner', 'drinking', 'Allen', 'abandonment', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'four', 'daughters.The', 'film', 'wonderful', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'end', 'would', 'be', 'cruel', 'reveal', 'nature', 'even', 'more', 'cruel', 'criticize', 'little', 'too', 'smarmy', 'climax', 'certainly', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'just', 'entire', 'film', 'caught', 'pleasantly', 'surprise', 'Binder', 'wrote', 'Allen', 'great', 'role', 'deserved', 'more', 'gift', 'left', 'unopened', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'classic', 'film', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'admirable', 'one', 'made', 'more', 'rewarding', 'recent', 'inability', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'market', 'anything', 'enduring', 'value']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)

633636,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00005JNP4,R.A. McKenzie,"[4, 5]","I wasn't really sure if I would like this, but one deep breath and 3 dollars later I sat back and took a chance with it.  I had the same experience with this movie as I did with ""Million Dollar Baby.""  The first 15 minutes really didn't do anything for me.  We meet the characters, who are seemingly going nowhere in both their lives or the plot...but then your patience comes very rewarded.The basic outline is Terry (Joan Allen, a real treasure) has realized that her husband has left her and their 4 daughters, likely with his secretary to Sweden.  Bitter and depressed, she drinks her life down, but not as an alcoholic (there are no drunk sequences at all).  Instead, she's just confused and angry, and needs a good chaser to mend some hurt feelings.The other star of the movie is Kevin Costner in a superb performance as Denny Davies, a former Detroit Tigers player, who's drinking buddy is now gone, so he spends his aimless days with Terry and the dysnfunctional family.  Between these two people is a connection of bittersweet romance, but certainly with heavy baggage along for the ride.The four daughters (Alicia Witt, Erika Christiansen, Keri Russell, Evan Rachel Wood) each have wonderfully-drawn supporting roles.  Their stories are coming-of-age tales, each with their won carefully-crafted traits.  Oldest daughter Hadley is in college with a somewhat-hateful relationship with her mother, but also copes with a fiance and a pregnancy.  Andy has no dreams of college, but instead works for Denny's sleazy producer.  Emily dreams of becoming a dancer, which has no place in Terry's philosophies of life.  And ""Popeye"" falls for a vague teenager, plus expresses a keen knack for documenting projects and themes...as well as the plot.I love how these characters verbally commnicate their frustrations with each other, but somehow there is unspoken tension between everybody.  Joan Allen is the main character, and does an Oscar-worthy job, but every one of Kevin Costner's lines put a big old smile on my face and often got a huge laugh out of me.  This is defintely Costner's best acting since the early 90s with ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""JFK.""The daughters all get enough screen-time to appreciate and become fascinated with their twists on the story.I do have a couple of negatives that I felt during this movie.  First off, the aforementioned opening scenes could've used a little more life in them.  When I compare the movie's final minutes with the opening scenes, I'm confused where the life in this movie suddenly bursted from.  My attention was literally gripped out of nowhere.Also, I do feel that in the 3 years that encompass this movie, not much really changes.  I find huge differences in my life within a couple of months, but the attitudes and beliefs of these characters don't change much within a couple of years.  Terry is as furious with her husband's in the beginning until about 15 minutes remain in the movie.  Denny Davies is already a little bit of a wandering fool with a good heart, but he doesn't really develop much.  The daughters experience the most change (pregnancy, love, sickness, bonding)...but instead of it being a gradual process, the situation kind of changes out of nowhere.However, because Mike Binder creates such enthralling personalities and has a gentle tone to the movie, it was very easy for me to absorb the sudden changes.  Binder has such minimal direction here that the slightest touches can go unnoticed.  For example, instead of a quick-cut and having a cop-out title card say ""4 Months Later,"" we get a wonderful blur from the Fall leaves to the snowy roads of Winter.""The Upside of Anger"" needed a little more time to develop and needed to give us a better opener.  However, with such colorful characters, dark humor (Terry imagining Denny's producer head explode is priceless), and genuine emotions being presented here...""The Upside of Anger"" is a very moving film.

Joan Allen and Kevin Costner were so in touch with the material that the 4 young starlets as her daughters were a little left out of the picture. Still, Ms. Allen was amazing in a complex characterization that left me exhausted. The hurt, confusion and anger were well displayed. Costner won a few awards for his performance, a presence that was at once cute and clever, as well as deeply concerned. Writer/director Mike Binder also filled the role of Costner's sleazy producer with vigor. Many have said that the four young ladies (daughters) were superficial, which may be a bit true, but this film was about Joan. Her daughters weren't very nice to her when she needed them most. The last film I can remember where 4 ingenues were thrown at you at once was ""Mona Lisa Smile"", but it was a different type of story, giving each a definite agenda. Binder created moments that almost looked like they were in fast-forward, showing Ms Allen's perception. That was clever. Once again, this is Ms Allen's film. My attention didn't stray much from her issues at hand. Though her daughters created some added angst, I was more concerned with how Ms Allen dealt with that angst. It's a really tough role, and she has no end of my admiration.  The clever, rapid-fire dialogue was reminiscent of the best of Billy Wilder or Preston Sturges.

633638,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNP4,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 4]","Joan Allen has one of her juiciest roles to date in ""The Upside of Anger,"" playing the neurotic mother of four daughters whose life is shattered when her husband leaves her for another woman.  Like Aurora Greenway in ""Terms of Endearment,"" Terry seems to have been put on this earth to drive her children crazy.  Yet, Terry also has reserves of strength, wisdom and common sense that can come into play when she isn't downing a pint of whiskey or trying to run the lives of everyone around her.""The Upside of Anger,"" though it deals with serious issues of abandonment and resentment (and anger, of course), is, essentially, a warmhearted comedy that has some wise and witty things to say about the complexities of mother-daughter relationships.  Terry has high expectations for each of her girls, so, naturally, she is a bit disconcerted when one of them chooses not to go to college and another hides the fact that she is pregnant and engaged to a man Terry has never even heard of let alone met.  The screenplay by writer/director Mike Binder explores the tensions between Terry and her various daughters without ever becoming trite and predictable along the way.  It's true that there could have been a bit more differentiation in the character of the four sisters; sometimes it's a little hard to tell who is who or what each of their particular goals or motivations are.  But that's a minor complaint when the movie, as a whole, is so insightful and witty about so many aspects of life.Conjuring up memories of ""Field of Dreams"" and ""Bull Durham,"" Kevin Costner returns to form in a low-keyed, understated performance as Denny, an ex pro-ball player and neighbor who develops romantic feelings for Terry.  A fellow alcoholic, he manages to bring his own share of complications and baggage into Terry's already stressful life.  (Denny serves a function very similar to the one provided by Jack Nicholson in ""Terms of Endearment"").As fine as the other actresses portraying her daughters are, this is clearly Allen's film (and she has never looked as beautiful as she does here).  She brilliantly conveys the many moods of a conflicted woman without ever once going over the edge or stepping out of character.  She sinks her teeth into the role and never lets go.  It's a virtuoso performance from one of the finest screen actresses of our time.The film ducks more than one potential ""chick flick"" clich&eacute; in its search for the truth (even avoiding what would have been a major and truly disastrous parallel to ""Terms of Endearment"").

I thought he was the perfect adversary to the Joan Allen character.  The movie needed a male character for Joan Allen to vent all of her hostility against men--and her husband--onto someone.  Yeah, Mike Binder was a sleazy character.  Wasn't Joan Allen's husband supposed to be like that?  When you see Mike Binder, you can understand why Joan Allen would react the way she does to someone like her husband.  She certainly wouldn't react that way to the Kevin Costner character.  He was supposed to be a supportive guy.  Let's face it--that's life.  There are bruised women like Joan Allen who have a vendetta against men.  It's universal.

633644,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JNP4,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 2]","Mike Binder wrote and directed ""The Upside of Anger,"" and also plays a somewhat-redeemable loser in the flick.  It's obvious that ""TUOA"" is a labor of love for Mr. Binder, but it's also obvious that he's in love with it a bit too much.  Virtually every writing instructor tells you that the hardest thing in writing is cutting a favorite character, subplot, or chapter in order to make the entire novel work.  Mr. Binder appears to have lacked that discipline on this project.And yet, ""TUOA"" succeeds more than it fails.  That success comes from three things - a generally funny script, and two pitch-perfect performances from Joan Allen and Kevin Costner.  Both actors are so true, so wrapped-up in their characters that we alternately acknowledge (in Allen's case) and concede (in Costner's) that these are two of the best actors working today.  (Maybe Costner should just act in movies that he doesn't direct . . .)Allen plays Terry Ann Wolfmeyer, mother of four gorgeous daughters -- one off at college and three in high school.  She lives in a huge McMansion that abuts some surprisingly dark woods.  But there is trouble in paradise (perhaps overly stated by the bar-like window frames everywhere in the house).  Terry's four daughters range from hating her to leaning that way, and Terry's husband (never seen) has apparently fled for Sweden with his nubile secretary.Enraged, Allen crawls inside Grey Goose vodka bottles, where she meets former baseball great Denny Davies (Costner), who lives nearby and hosts a local radio show where he talks about anything except baseball.  Denny, perpetually pleasantly buzzed on Budweiser (from a can), sees another soul in pain and begins one of the laziest, most drunken seductions ever seen on film.  But Terry sees the good in Denny, and she more or less tolerates his advances.Eventually, they become the booziest couple in film history since Nick and Nora Charles from the ""Thin Man"" movies.  Their relationship hits roadblocks and speedbumps, most notably when Denny does his version of Rhett Butler's ""No lock's going to keep me out, Scarlett"" rampage -- this is one of the movie's most entertaining scenes.  But through it all, Costner and Allen give Denny and Terry life and depth that is absent from so many other movies.  Watch as Costner nervously caresses his immminent bald spot when pressed into a corner, and watch how Allen shifts from defense-to-attack when challenged by a rebellious daughter.  Fine work.That said, ""TUOA"" is over-written and includes about five too many subplots.  The daughters get a few individual moments, but there's just not enough for them to do.  Binder gives a good performance as Denny's sleazy womanizing producer Shep, but the movie spends a lot of time crushing and redeeming Shep when he's really a minor player.  Binder also could have easily cut the exposition narrative from the younger daughter . . . cute teenagers only talk like this in movies.All in all, you can miss ""TUOA"" and you won't have missed much . . . except for two classic performances by two talented actors at the top of their game.  You'll get more than a few laughs out of it, too.",3,Joan Allen and Kevin Costner Shine in Over-written dramedy,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,3152,"['Mike', 'Binder', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'also', 'somewhat-redeemable', 'loser', 'flick', 'obvious', 'TUOA', 'labor', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Binder', 'also', 'obvious', 'love', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Virtually', 'writing', 'instructor', 'hardest', 'thing', 'writing', 'cutting', 'favorite', 'character', 'subplot', 'chapter', 'order', 'make', 'entire', 'novel', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Binder', 'have', 'lacked', 'discipline', 'project.And', 'yet', 'TUOA', 'more', 'success', 'three', 'things', 'generally', 'funny', 'script', 'two', 'pitch-perfect', 'performances', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'true', 'so', 'wrapped-up', 'characters', 'alternately', 'acknowledge', 'Allen', 'case', 'concede', 'Costner', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'Maybe', 'Costner', 'should', 'just', 'act', 'movies', ""n't"", 'direct', 'Allen', 'Terry', 'Ann', 'Wolfmeyer', 'mother', 'four', 'gorgeous', 'daughters', 'one', 'off', 'college', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'huge', 'McMansion', 'surprisingly', 'dark', 'woods', 'trouble', 'paradise', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'stated', 'bar-like', 'window', 'frames', 'everywhere', 'house', 'Terry', 'four', 'daughters', 'range', 'hating', 'leaning', 'way', 'Terry', 'husband', 'never', 'seen', 'apparently', 'fled', 'Sweden', 'nubile', 'secretary.Enraged', 'Allen', 'Grey', 'Goose', 'vodka', 'bottles', 'where', 'former', 'baseball', 'great', 'Denny', 'Davies', 'Costner', 'who', 'nearby', 'local', 'radio', 'show', 'where', 'anything', 'baseball', 'Denny', 'perpetually', 'pleasantly', 'buzzed', 'Budweiser', 'can', 'soul', 'pain', 'one', 'laziest', 'most', 'drunken', 'seductions', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Terry', 'good', 'Denny', 'more', 'less', 'advances.Eventually', 'become', 'booziest', 'couple', 'film', 'history', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movies', 'relationship', 'roadblocks', 'speedbumps', 'most', 'notably', 'when', 'Denny', 'version', 'Rhett', 'Butler', 'No', 'lock', 'going', 'keep', 'out', 'Scarlett', 'rampage', 'one', 'movie', 'most', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'Costner', 'Allen', 'give', 'Denny', 'Terry', 'life', 'depth', 'absent', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'Watch', 'Costner', 'nervously', 'immminent', 'bald', 'spot', 'when', 'pressed', 'corner', 'watch', 'how', 'Allen', 'defense-to-attack', 'when', 'challenged', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'Fine', 'said', 'TUOA', 'over-written', 'five', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'daughters', 'get', 'few', 'individual', 'moments', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'do', 'Binder', 'good', 'performance', 'Denny', 'sleazy', 'womanizing', 'producer', 'Shep', 'movie', 'lot', 'time', 'crushing', 'redeeming', 'Shep', 'when', 'really', 'minor', 'player', 'Binder', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'cut', 'exposition', 'narrative', 'younger', 'daughter', 'cute', 'teenagers', 'only', 'talk', 'movies.All', 'can', 'miss', 'TUOA', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'missed', 'much', 'two', 'classic', 'performances', 'two', 'talented', 'actors', 'top', 'game', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'few', 'too']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)

Cheeky homages to urban cluelessness, studies of ordinary people in ordinary towns facing ordinary problems.But there's an extraordinary flair, a rhythm, to the way their stories are told. You keep watching because you relate to the characters and mull over their predicament long after the credits have rolled. The bookish narration may be one downside, you think, but traces of good humor and some taut acting all round are surely the upsides of anger and they make up handsomely.One for the discerning types.

Based on the flimsiest circumstantial evidence, the wife, Terry (Joan Allen), assumes that her heretofore responsible and loving husband has flown the coop with his Swedish secretary. Moreover, over a period of years she makes no serious effort to track him down. Instead, Terry, an intelligent, educated, stay-at-home mom living an upper class privileged lifestyle with four intelligent daughters ranging from fifteen to early twenties decides to immediately turn herself into an alcoholic. The anger she shows is mostly directed at the people closest to her.As soon as Terry starts drinking herself into a daily stupor, her neighbor Denny (Kevin Costner) ingratiates himself as her drinking buddy. Denny is an ex-baseball star who, for reasons unknown (anger, maybe?), became an alcoholic long ago. So these two alcoholics get along drinking and watching stupid TV shows all day. Well, they cut back on some of the TV once they become lovers. But they don't cut back on the booze.After years of putting up with Terry's ""bad moods,"" which the sex doesn't seem to ameliorate, Denny gets fed up and starts showing some anger of his own. He kicks down a heavy door with Terry on the other side. If Terry had been standing closer to the door, she could easily have been killed. But hey, Denny was just expressing anger and a terrified Terry couldn't apologize enough for her bad moods, begging Denny to come back. And from that point on, Denny is no longer passive, no longer anyone's ""bitch"" (as he tells Terry).

So why is this ""witty"" and ""poignant"" character-driven film from writer/director/actor Mike Binder flat as a pancake?  Maybe because it's not witty nor poignant, but it seems to think it is.  The Upside of Anger trots out tired cliches--the bored and boozy suburban housewife, the middle-aged has-been trying to find himself (Costner stretching himself in another washed-up baseball player role), the daughters coming of age, dealing with sex and boyfriends and having runs-ins with mom every other day.  There doesn't seem to be a big point to it all--does Binder think he's telling us anything new?!?  There are also way too many cribs, or attempted cribs, from Terms of Endearment, including a sudden serious hospital illness, to make this seem like anything more than a tired conceit of a movie wallowing in pretention.  (Plus it just reminds you how fresh Terms of Endearment was in 1982.  But 2005 is not 1982.)  Allen, always natural and effortless, gets to strut her stuff as the middle-aged mom with a fondness for Grey Goose vodka; Costner is well-cast--he never displays much range but in the right role he fits like a comfortable old pair of shoes.  Binder gives himself a major role as a radio producer in a subplot that goes littlewhere and seems more like a vanity trip than an exploration of anything germaine to the movie.  The love interest of one daughter, Dane Christensen, has a pointless role, that climaxes puzzlingly when he smashes through a glass window while bungee-jumping from a tree (and if that makes little sense to you, it makes even less sense in the context of the film).  The four daughters themselves (Alicia Witt, Keri Russell, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood) are bland and interchangeable--maybe one daughter less and one subplot less would have given the movie more focus.  But even better would have been more unique situations and setups for the conflicts, which are as forseeable as an Iraq quadmire.  Too often in this movie mom just pops off on the typical things TV and movie moms pop off on all the time: mouthy children, the claustrophobia of suburbia, neighbors who want to get them between the sheets.  Although the film tries the patented James L. Brooks formula of lurching from hilarity to pathos in an eyeblink, here the quips aren't funny, the drama not fresh, the psychological underpinnings pedestrian.  We've seen it all before--on Desperate Housewives, for example, to which stylistically this movie bears more than a passing resemblance, especially when it comes to the undistinguished music score (amazingly, composed by Alexandre Desplat, who turned out far more unique and extraordinary work for the Nicole Kidman film Birth; this one he seems to have phoned in).Well, we've *almost* seen it all before.  At the very end there is a twist so unusual that I have to admit I was totally taken by surprise for once.  The official Amazon review calls it ""wrongheaded,"" but I disagree: this oddball direction is just what the rest of the movie needed.  But is it worth waiting two hours for?  For me, the answer is definitely no.  Joan Allen, I love you, but better luck next time.The DVD looks great, with a near-perfect transfer.  There are commentaries and the obligatory ""making of"" documentary, but this film left me so bored that I cared about neither.

633657,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNP4,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","First let me say I really like Joan Allen. Anyone who has seen such films as `The Crucible' and `The Contender' knows her enormous talent, and in `The Notebook' she even gave depth and nuance to a character that could have been very flat. If real upside of `Upside of Anger' should be named, it is the presence of Joan Allen, who can grab your attention simply by sitting at a dinner table as Terry Ann Wolfmeyer, angry wife who has taken to drinking after her husband left her house.To her comes easy-going neighbor Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), a radio dick jockey and retired pro baseball player. The main plot involves the curious relation between two hard-drinking lost souls Terry and Denny with comical touch from Director Mike Binder, who manages to create some mirthful moments out of this unlikely couple. It must be said that to his credit Mike Binder (who also appears as sleazy radio producer) has successfully extracted excellent performances from the two leads, but as I said, as to Joan Allen who can shine even in action flick like `Face Off,' this is no news.Terry has four daughters (played by Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Alicia Witt, Evan Rachel Wood), and all of them provide sub-plots. It is regrettable that for all the names assembled here, none of these fragmentary sub-plots are interesting. These girls tormented by their mother are meant as the flip side of `Little Women,' but none of them are allowed to have their own recognizable voices as Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. The episodes about them are mostly forgettable ones, or at best misfires with failed comic attempts that fall flat.But in addition to its overlong story, the film also suffers from two things: one is the frequent allusions to wars or news from Afghanistan. Perhaps these footages suggest another nature of anger, `downside' of it, but I don't think the anger of a deserted wife, understandable as it is, could be equated to that of the people living in strife-torn countries.The other drawback is a simpler one. There is a surprise waiting for you at the end which I cannot disclose here. The surprise, I think, is meant for irony, giving another meaning to Terry's constant anger, but if Terry had done what a normal person, angry or not, would usually do, there would have been no such surprise as this.For all the brilliant acting from Joan Allen, I really want to ask you ... Can a person be angry for three years like Terry? Maybe he or she can, but the film would not tell us much about such people or Terry, whose hell-raising anger really makes her daughters miserable. Yes, some viewers would find it amusing to see the characters behaving badly to each other or in public, and I have no problem with that. But at the same time what kind of a film is it when it is based on a contrived premise and hateful characters whose portraits can show little insight or wisdom? But of course, it depends. I know. Still I think there are better ways for these talented actors to show the characters' anger than 'Scanners'-like 'head-explosion' episode or Kevin Costner's kicking down a bedroom door.",3,(2.5 STARS) Brilliant Acting from Joan Allen Who Deserves a Much Better Story,1164931200,"12 1, 2006",2006,3097,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'really', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'such', 'films', 'Crucible', 'Contender', 'enormous', 'talent', 'Notebook', 'even', 'gave', 'depth', 'nuance', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'flat', 'real', 'upside', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'should', 'be', 'named', 'presence', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'who', 'can', 'grab', 'attention', 'simply', 'sitting', 'dinner', 'table', 'Terry', 'Ann', 'Wolfmeyer', 'angry', 'wife', 'who', 'taken', 'drinking', 'husband', 'left', 'house.To', 'easy-going', 'neighbor', 'Denny', 'Davies', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'radio', 'dick', 'jockey', 'retired', 'pro', 'baseball', 'player', 'main', 'plot', 'curious', 'relation', 'two', 'hard-drinking', 'lost', 'souls', 'Terry', 'Denny', 'comical', 'touch', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'who', 'create', 'mirthful', 'moments', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'credit', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'who', 'also', 'sleazy', 'radio', 'producer', 'successfully', 'extracted', 'excellent', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'said', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'who', 'can', 'shine', 'even', 'action', 'flick', 'Face', 'Off', 'news.Terry', 'four', 'daughters', 'played', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'provide', 'sub-plots', 'regrettable', 'names', 'assembled', 'here', 'none', 'fragmentary', 'sub-plots', 'are', 'interesting', 'girls', 'tormented', 'mother', 'are', 'meant', 'flip', 'side', 'Little', 'Women', 'none', 'are', 'allowed', 'have', 'own', 'recognizable', 'voices', 'Meg', 'Jo', 'Beth', 'Amy', 'episodes', 'are', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'ones', 'best', 'misfires', 'failed', 'comic', 'attempts', 'fall', 'flat.But', 'addition', 'overlong', 'story', 'film', 'also', 'two', 'things', 'one', 'frequent', 'allusions', 'wars', 'news', 'Afghanistan', 'Perhaps', 'footages', 'suggest', 'nature', 'anger', 'downside', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anger', 'deserted', 'wife', 'understandable', 'could', 'be', 'equated', 'people', 'living', 'strife-torn', 'countries.The', 'other', 'drawback', 'simpler', 'one', 'surprise', 'waiting', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'disclose', 'here', 'surprise', 'think', 'meant', 'irony', 'giving', 'meaning', 'Terry', 'constant', 'anger', 'Terry', 'had', 'done', 'what', 'normal', 'person', 'angry', 'not', 'would', 'usually', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'such', 'surprise', 'this.For', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'really', 'want', 'ask', 'Can', 'person', 'be', 'angry', 'three', 'years', 'Terry', 'Maybe', 'can', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'tell', 'much', 'such', 'people', 'Terry', 'hell-raising', 'anger', 'really', 'daughters', 'miserable', 'Yes', 'viewers', 'would', 'find', 'amusing', 'see', 'characters', 'behaving', 'badly', 'other', 'public', 'have', 'problem', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'when', 'based', 'contrived', 'premise', 'hateful', 'characters', 'portraits', 'can', 'show', 'little', 'insight', 'wisdom', 'course', 'know', 'Still', 'think', 'are', 'better', 'ways', 'talented', 'actors', 'show', 'characters', 'anger', ""'Scanners'-like"", ""'head-explosion"", 'episode', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'kicking', 'down', 'bedroom', 'door']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)

Kevin Costner is better as an ex-baseball star and radio jock who lives nearby and longs for stability. Binder himself, as Costner's producer, makes a believable jerk. They are the only reasons for watching this pointless and unpleasant picture. Between the subplot clutter and self-absorbed characters, there is nothing to admire and nobody to like. The surprise ending does not surprise and, in fact, aborts the film's premise.Directors usually try to cast actors who resemble siblings or a parent, but no effort was made here; the teenagers are attractive but disparate (and spend a lot of time in the kitchen.) Costner's umpteenth turn at bat is a two-base hit, charmingly fey. Allen, as resourceful and serious a stage and screen actress as we have, mostly acts drunk, uncaring and rude, as though booze excuses bad behavior. When we're finally asked to pity her, we don't.

633659,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B00005JNP4,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[6, 8]","This film is the bittersweet tale of a family coming to terms with life and each other.  Written and directed by Mike Binder, it starts out at a funeral and then flashes back three years into the past.  It's primarily a love story between the estranged wife Terry Wolfenmeyer played by Joan Allen, and the semi-retired ex baseball jock neighbor, Denny Davies played by Kevin Costner.  Terry's husband has apparently run off to Sweden with his receptionist leaving her and her four adolescent daughters to fend for themselves.  Terry is torn up by the betrayal and turns to alcohol as a crutch, which works out well for Denny, who starts out as her drinking buddy.Denny can tell how hurt Terry really his, and provides quiet support when she needs it.  Each of the four daughters and her relationship with their mother is also a sub-plot, and this helps the film be more true to life than many films.  The dialogue is witty and well-written.  Joan Allen, though, really shines in this movie.  Her portrayal of the bitter, almost alcoholic, betrayed wife is just phenomenal.  Her sniping with her daughters and her facial expressions are just spot on.  A truly great and memorable performance.  Costner, although, not quite as good as Allen, does a solid job of playing Denny.  Overall, I thought this was one of Costner's better performances.There are moments of this film that are laugh at loud funny, and moments that are touchingly sad.  Again that makes this film more realistic, and is a credit to Mike Binder who wrote and directed the film.  He also plays a good bit role as Denny's sleazy radio producer.The cinematography is well done, with the passing seasons used to show the passage of time.  Too many romantic comedies happen in a kind of frozen landscape, where the story is the only thing important, and nothing outside of the story changes.  This film is different, the landscape changes, and, more importantly, the characters change over time, again much more realistic than most films.My only real gripe about this film was the younger daughter's cheesy documentary being used as kind of the ""message' of the film; ""it's easier to react with anger than love"".  Yeah, yeah we get it, the old films of slapstick comedy and the cartoon characters banging each other over the head are superfluous.  We especially get the message when Terry looks at her four daughters sitting together at the end of the film and imagines them as they were 15 years, 10 years and 5 years ago.A great story, with great dialogue, solid cinematography, solid acting with a ""one for the ages"" performance by Joan Allen, combine to make this a very enjoyable film.

633660,A1O60Q7LBN4MQ,B00005JNP4,Wendy Schroeder,"[2, 2]","I really enjoyed this movie if only for Joan Allen's portrayal of a bitter blooming-alcoholic living in the 'burbs with 4 beautiful daughters around 15 to 21. Kevin plays a retired baseball player now DJ (for WRIF-FM, the station I listened to often in Detroit when I was in my late teens and early '20s). He too drinks way too much. They find solace in each other.I loved watching Joan Allen and the movie does have a good script. I liked all the major characters in it except one. All but the detestable middle age guy. He only goes out with young women is made to be the guy you love to hate.I think most women over 40 will like this movie. I highly recommend it to them and anyone who enjoys films about relationships.",4,Good relationship movie,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,722,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'only', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'portrayal', 'bitter', 'blooming-alcoholic', 'living', ""'burbs"", '4', 'beautiful', 'daughters', '15', '21', 'Kevin', 'retired', 'baseball', 'player', 'now', 'DJ', 'WRIF-FM', 'station', 'listened', 'often', 'Detroit', 'when', 'was', 'late', 'teens', 'early', ""'20s"", 'too', 'drinks', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'find', 'solace', 'other.I', 'loved', 'watching', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'script', 'liked', 'major', 'characters', 'one', 'detestable', 'middle', 'age', 'guy', 'only', 'out', 'young', 'women', 'made', 'be', 'guy', 'love', 'hate.I', 'think', 'most', 'women', '40', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'films', 'relationships']",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)
