Zwick,"[4, 5]","""Are We Done Yet?"" is probably the only film in movie history to be both a sequel to one movie (""Are We There Yet?"") and a remake of another (""Mr. Blanding Builds His Dream House"").The movie picks up where ""Are We There Yet?"" left off, with confirmed bachelor Nick Persons having tied the knot with his main squeeze, Suzanne (Nia Long), and adopted her two children, Kevin and Lindsey.  Desperate to get his new family out of his two-by-four Portland apartment, Nick purchases a home in the country, a dilapidated relic that gives a whole new meaning to the term ""fixer-upper.""""Are We Done Yet?"" starts off with a clever animated title sequence that brings to mind the work of the great Saul Bass in the 1950's and 1960's.  Unfortunately, it's strictly downhill from there.  For bad as it was, the original found at least a modicum of comic tension in the conflict between Nick and the two bratty kids who hated him.  Here Nick is forced to wage an endless battle with an assortment of woodland creatures, shady contractors, loose floorboards, insect infestations, dry rot and a whole host of other homeowner inconveniences.  Far from being antagonists, the other family members are reduced to little more than a grating Greek chorus cynically commenting on the hapless man's nonstop travails.Ice Cube demonstrates a certain minor flair as an actor, but even Jim Carrey would have trouble making a silk purse out of this pratfall-laden sow's ear.  With its bland mixture of anemic slapstick and gooey sentimentality, ""Are We Done Yet?"" is about as dreadful a movie comedy as has come down the pike in quite some time.

I'm not big on sequels in the first place and this film did little to change that.  In fact, it reinforced my distaste for them.My biggest problem is that the film starts off making little sense.  For example, why would everyone have to move into Ice Cube's cramped broken-down apartment after they married?  Why does he have a such an apartment when he's a very successful business man?  He did own a Custom Lincoln Navigator in the first film.  And what was wrong with moving in with the mom, Nia Long, who had a magnificent house in the first film and was as equally as successful as Cube?  I just don't get the reason for perpetuating urban slum stereotype as the reason to move out to the country.  Couldn't they just move because of a job transfer or something?My second big issue with this film is how the characters don't grow into anything likable.  The children now make me cringe and come across as very spoiled, Nia Long has become a nagging shrew, and Ice Cube is ALWAYS mad at something.  John C. McGinley (Scrubs) is the only reason to watch this rather unwatchable film.  His deft comedic performance is an absolute delight.  He absolutely steals every scene he is in and you wish he was in every scene.This film is rather boring for long stretches and most of the comedy seems very forced with the exception of McGinley, who, again, makes this whole film worth watching in the short run and thank God this film is short.

1080971,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B000RBA6C4,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 0]","In 2005, ""Are We There Yet?"" was the first movie in the ""Are We...Yet?"" series and it was really good back then and performed fairly well, its still a great movie even today. In 2007 a sequel, ""Are We Gone Yet?"", came out, with once again Nick but this time with his family as they move to a new house after deciding Nick`s apartment is too small, and with a baby coming they have to find a new house.The script was based on a good idea and it was charming as well with some great moments and with a touch of humor added to it. After falling in love with in the first movie, Suzanne,he offered to take care of her two children when she couldn`t and so they embarked on a trip to see the kids`s dad. What a memorable trip that was! The kids really gave Nick a hard time but in the end they decided he was a good step father and it was a happy ending. Now ""Are We Done Yet"" sees the family moving to a new house in a new town and with a twins coming soon and Nick`s apartment being too small for them it was the best thing to do. Not too long after they arrive the house needs some fixing and they get a professional`s help and with his crew they quickly get to work. What they don`t know yet, is that the guy whom they hired, Chuck Mitchel Jr, is in fact a contractor, home inspector, a baby whisper and a city inspector and is only making things worse by destroying the house part by part and that and ends up costing a lot. Nick will eventually discover that and he can`t seem to do much about it. Of course other things happen as Nick has projects for a sports magazine and other things but that`s the basic story of the film.The movie was based on the 1948 classic ""Mr.Blandings Builds His Dream House"" and takes a lot from it,to the point where it`s a not a sequel anymore but a copy in many ways. The first film in the series was something different, original and creative and everyone could enjoy it, now that`s gone and few people can really enjoy this movie, maybe if they haven`t seen the first one or they don`t know about ""Mr.Blandings Builds His Dream House"" they will like it. It was less than I expected and even if there are a few good moral values here, its not enough to keep this movie from being a disappointment. I did enjoy the movie still, I mean I gave it a three stars rating after all,they still managed to pull out something watchable and for this sequel the directors and most of the crew from the original apparently changed which could explain why it turned out like this. The thing I don`t get is in the first movie Nick appears to be loaded as he has all the bling-bling clothes,the great car, nice job and his wife to be in the first movie had a house, yet they live in Nick`s lousy apartment? Someone Explain this.There are some strong moments and some funny ones that makes it an OK movie. What I don`t like is how the characters are, I mean Nick is okay even if he does yell more than anything else, he`s still the main event and all but the kids have really changed and the girl is now a real annoying teen. Overall this feels a lot like watching a house being built and destroyed with constant up and downs.There is enough substance to keep the watchers interested,mostly Chuck who is a great character that adds suspense and as much as he can be an idiot, he`s also a good guy and John C. McGinley, the actor who plays his role gives quite a great performance. The first one was great but they probably screwed the series pretty bad right here,unless they can do a third movie in the spirit of the first then I seriously think they should stop it right there. I am confident that they will do better next time, that is if there really is going to be a next time. 3/5.",3,Lackluster Sequel,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,3705,"['2005', 'Are', 'Yet', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Are', 'Yet', 'series', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'back', 'then', 'performed', 'fairly', 'well', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'today', '2007', 'sequel', 'Are', 'Gone', 'Yet', 'came', 'out', 'once', 'again', 'Nick', 'time', 'family', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'deciding', 'Nick', 's', 'apartment', 'too', 'small', 'baby', 'coming', 'have', 'find', 'new', 'house.The', 'script', 'was', 'based', 'good', 'idea', 'was', 'charming', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'moments', 'touch', 'humor', 'added', 'falling', 'love', 'first', 'movie', 'Suzanne', 'offered', 'take', 'care', 'two', 'children', 'when', 'couldn', 't', 'so', 'embarked', 'trip', 'see', 'kids', 's', 'dad', 'What', 'memorable', 'trip', 'was', 'kids', 'really', 'gave', 'Nick', 'hard', 'time', 'end', 'decided', 'was', 'good', 'step', 'father', 'was', 'happy', 'ending', 'Now', 'Are', 'Done', 'family', 'moving', 'new', 'house', 'new', 'town', 'twins', 'coming', 'soon', 'Nick', 's', 'apartment', 'being', 'too', 'small', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'Not', 'too', 'long', 'arrive', 'house', 'fixing', 'get', 'professional', 's', 'help', 'crew', 'quickly', 'get', 'work', 'What', 'don', 't', 'know', 'yet', 'guy', 'whom', 'hired', 'Chuck', 'Mitchel', 'Jr', 'fact', 'contractor', 'home', 'inspector', 'baby', 'whisper', 'city', 'inspector', 'only', 'making', 'things', 'worse', 'destroying', 'house', 'part', 'part', 'up', 'costing', 'lot', 'Nick', 'will', 'eventually', 'discover', 'can', 't', 'seem', 'do', 'much', 'course', 'other', 'things', 'happen', 'Nick', 'projects', 'sports', 'magazine', 'other', 'things', 's', 'basic', 'story', 'film.The', 'movie', 'was', 'based', '1948', 'classic', 'Mr.Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', 'lot', 'point', 'where', 's', 'not', 'sequel', 'anymore', 'copy', 'many', 'ways', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'was', 'something', 'different', 'original', 'creative', 'everyone', 'could', 'enjoy', 'now', 's', 'gone', 'few', 'people', 'can', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'maybe', 'haven', 't', 'seen', 'first', 'one', 'don', 't', 'know', 'Mr.Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', 'will', 'like', 'was', 'less', 'expected', 'even', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'moral', 'values', 'here', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'disappointment', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'still', 'mean', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'rating', 'still', 'managed', 'pull', 'out', 'something', 'watchable', 'sequel', 'directors', 'most', 'crew', 'original', 'apparently', 'changed', 'could', 'explain', 'why', 'turned', 'out', 'thing', 'don', 't', 'get', 'first', 'movie', 'Nick', 'be', 'loaded', 'bling-bling', 'clothes', 'great', 'car', 'nice', 'job', 'wife', 'be', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'house', 'yet', 'live', 'Nick', 's', 'lousy', 'apartment', 'Someone', 'Explain', 'are', 'strong', 'moments', 'funny', 'ones', 'OK', 'movie', 'What', 'don', 't', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'mean', 'Nick', 'okay', 'even', 'yell', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 's', 'still', 'main', 'event', 'kids', 'have', 'really', 'changed', 'girl', 'now', 'real', 'annoying', 'teen', 'Overall', 'lot', 'watching', 'house', 'being', 'built', 'destroyed', 'constant', 'up', 'downs.There', 'enough', 'substance', 'keep', 'watchers', 'interested', 'mostly', 'Chuck', 'who', 'great', 'character', 'suspense', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'idiot', 's', 'also', 'good', 'guy', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'actor', 'who', 'role', 'quite', 'great', 'performance', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'great', 'probably', 'screwed', 'series', 'pretty', 'bad', 'right', 'here', 'can', 'do', 'third', 'movie', 'spirit', 'first', 'then', 'seriously', 'think', 'should', 'stop', 'right', 'there', 'am', 'confident', 'will', 'do', 'better', 'next', 'time', 'really', 'going', 'be', 'next', 'time', '3/5']",N/A

BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE.  Both of those films are better than ARE WE DONE YET?, but overall the film isn't too bad.In this movie Nick (Ice Cube) and Suzanne (Nia Long) are married and the entire family has moved into Nick's apartment.  Nick has sold his sports collectible shop and started a sports magazine.  The apartment is way too small for everyone, but space is even more of an issue when Suzanne notifies Nick that she's pregnant.  Nick and Suzanne have been house hunting, but it isn't until they meet realtor Chuck Mitchell, Jr. (John C. McGinley) and tour one of his homes in the country away from Portland that they agree that they've found the ideal home for their family.  The home needs some work initially seems fine and in working order.  But then the problems start.  Nick finds himself faced with one remodeling issue after another.  When he calls a contractor in to look things over and fix things up, he discovers that not only is Chuck the only local realtor, he's also the only local contractor.  More and more problems are discovered and the bills pile up as Nick struggles to find a balance between keeping his family together, starting his new magazine, and building a home.  As Nick discovers, when you're a homeowner the work is never done.I had been pleasantly surprised by ARE WE DONE YET? and was curious how well the sequel would be.  Overall, the film isn't too bad.  It is formulaic in some parts and doesn't break any new ground.  However, as a sequel it works rather well.  Ice Cube might not be a comic genius, but his talent as a physical film comedian has grown enormously in the past few years.  The real comic value and much of the emotional depth of the film comes from John C. McGinley's portrayal of Chuck.  Chuck could have easily been portrayed as a jerk that somehow gets everyone in Nick's family to like him.  However, McGinley doesn't portray Chuck that way.  Instead, we get a man who is passionately devoted to his work and who even though can be annoying at times, is also extremely likeable.  I know that ARE WE DONE YET? will not have an initial appeal to a huge audience, but I would suggest watching the movie for McGinley's performance alone.  It's worth it.Recommended for those who saw ARE WE THERE YET?, for those just looking for an average family comedy, and for anyone who is a fan of any of the cast members.",3,Moving On Out to the Country.,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,2519,"['WE', 'DONE', 'YET', 'sequel', 'fairly', 'successful', '2005', 'comedy', 'ARE', 'WE', 'THERE', 'YET', 'remake', 'classic', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'film', 'MR.', 'BLANDINGS', 'BUILDS', 'HIS', 'DREAM', 'HOUSE', 'films', 'are', 'better', 'ARE', 'WE', 'DONE', 'YET', 'film', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad.In', 'movie', 'Nick', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Suzanne', 'Nia', 'Long', 'are', 'married', 'entire', 'family', 'moved', 'Nick', 'apartment', 'Nick', 'sold', 'sports', 'collectible', 'shop', 'started', 'sports', 'magazine', 'apartment', 'way', 'too', 'small', 'everyone', 'space', 'even', 'more', 'issue', 'when', 'Suzanne', 'Nick', 'pregnant', 'Nick', 'Suzanne', 'have', 'been', 'house', 'hunting', ""n't"", 'meet', 'realtor', 'Chuck', 'Mitchell', 'Jr.', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'tour', 'one', 'homes', 'country', 'away', 'Portland', 'agree', ""'ve"", 'found', 'ideal', 'home', 'family', 'home', 'work', 'initially', 'fine', 'working', 'order', 'then', 'problems', 'start', 'Nick', 'faced', 'one', 'remodeling', 'issue', 'When', 'contractor', 'look', 'things', 'fix', 'things', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'Chuck', 'only', 'local', 'realtor', 'also', 'only', 'local', 'contractor', 'More', 'more', 'problems', 'are', 'discovered', 'bills', 'pile', 'up', 'Nick', 'find', 'balance', 'keeping', 'family', 'together', 'starting', 'new', 'magazine', 'building', 'home', 'Nick', 'discovers', 'when', ""'re"", 'homeowner', 'work', 'never', 'done.I', 'had', 'been', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'ARE', 'WE', 'DONE', 'YET', 'was', 'curious', 'how', 'well', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'Overall', 'film', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'formulaic', 'parts', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'However', 'sequel', 'rather', 'well', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'comic', 'genius', 'talent', 'physical', 'film', 'comedian', 'grown', 'enormously', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'real', 'comic', 'value', 'much', 'emotional', 'depth', 'film', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'portrayal', 'Chuck', 'Chuck', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'portrayed', 'jerk', 'somehow', 'everyone', 'Nick', 'family', 'However', 'McGinley', ""n't"", 'portray', 'Chuck', 'way', 'Instead', 'get', 'man', 'who', 'passionately', 'devoted', 'work', 'who', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'times', 'also', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'know', 'ARE', 'WE', 'DONE', 'YET', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'initial', 'appeal', 'huge', 'audience', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', 'movie', 'McGinley', 'performance', 'alone', 'worth', 'it.Recommended', 'who', 'saw', 'ARE', 'WE', 'THERE', 'YET', 'just', 'looking', 'average', 'family', 'comedy', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'cast', 'members']",N/A
1080974,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B000RBA6C4,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[0, 0]","This is the kind of film so bad that it deserves a public, near-lethal beating. And I'm in the mood to deliver it.Someone in Hollywood seems to ""have it in"" for classic Cary Grant films. First there was ""The Preacher's Wife"", a remake of a truly fine film, ""The Bishop's Wife"" (with Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven). (It's a Christmas film, thematically similar to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and I can't recommend it highly enough.) ""Preacher's"" was apparently intended as a vehicle for the late Whitney Houston's singing. I watched the first 15 minutes, and was so upset by its awfulness that I couldn't watch any more.Sunday night, while browsing the newspaper, I chanced across ""Are We Done Yet?"" and decided to give it a try. The opening credits said it was adapted from another Grant film, ""Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House"", an unquestioned minor classic. Grant -- an ad executive -- and his wife Myrna Loy -- live in a cramped apartment and yearn for more space. The film details their problems in finding -- and restoring -- a suitable house, along with Grant's problems in coming up with a new and improved slogan for Wham ham. It also takes some fairly astute pokes at the advertising industry, before it was fashionable to do so. The screenplay was adapted from a novel of the same name, by none other than Norman Panama & Melvin Frank.""Done?"" bears only a superficial relationship to ""Blandings"" -- it's about a man fixing up a house -- so one wonders why the producers felt obliged to give credit. (The idea was hardly new. A Jack Benny film, ""George Washington Slept Here"" (made six years earlier), covered the same ground. And then there's Buster Keaton's classic ""One Week"" (1920), in which he and his bride attempt to assemble a kit house.) I'd like to imagine everyone involved with ""Blandings"" rising from the dead and casting the producers of ""Done?"" into the deepest pit of Hell -- ""How dare you claim that our infinitely better film was inspiration for your piece of ****!""""Blandings"" shows just how much film comedy has declined in 60 years. To get across how small the apartment is, Grant and Loy are shown in close-up maneuvering around each other as they try to use the bathroom's sink & mirror at the same time. The humor builds from the situation, not slapstick. But ""Done?"" has the family in a not-overly-small kitchen, splattering each other with food. It's not just unfunny -- it's stupid.""Blandings"" tells a coherent story. ""Done?"" simply moves from one lame, unfunny scene to another, without any sense of purpose. The writers have no idea how to write sharp dialog, or build a scene (or sequence) with a beginning, middle, and end. And naturally, they ignore common sense when it gets in the way of of the plot. Nick (Ice Cube) doesn't bother to have the house inspected (which the mortgage company would likely have required), and overlooks the fact the Chuck (John McGinley) lied to him about the house's condition, which would justify a lawsuit.What is particularly obnoxious about ""Are We Done Yet?"" is that it was actually /made/. The money could have been used for more-worthy ventures. And as an unproduced screenwriter, I'm upset (that's putting it mildly) that the untalented doofuses who wrote this film (Barrett Strong & Norman Whitfield), were actually /paid/ for it. No wonder new writers have so much trouble breaking into Hollywood.This is one of those films that, as they say, if it were a dog, it would shed. Utter garbage.
