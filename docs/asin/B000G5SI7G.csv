998774,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B000G5SI7G,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[4, 4]","Although I don't believe in ghosts, I love ghost stories, and this TV movie is exceptionally good.  It is a scary mystery with an engrossing story, wonderful acting, and a surprise ending.Ted Danson, plays James Van Praagh who has inherited a gift of being able to see the dead, which he tries to deny until he's contacted by a group of boys who have been murdered.  He finally realizes that the boys persistence stems from the fact that the murders are continuing and they need his help to stop them.It's sufficiently well done that even when you know the solution, you will want to watch the movie again for the acting and the truly moving story.  There's even a scene for insiders with James Van Praagh playing the organ.  The story is supposedly based on his life, but you have to know what he looks like in order to recognize him at the organ.My favorite scenes are when the dog comes for the elderly man who has died in the hospital and leads him to his family as well as some of the touching stories that are expressed in meetings by people who want to talk to their loved ones who have died.The story is scary, but is done in an upbeat way that treats death not as an end, but as a continuum.",5,An eerie little plot.,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,1200,"['do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ghosts', 'love', 'ghost', 'stories', 'TV', 'movie', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'scary', 'mystery', 'engrossing', 'story', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'surprise', 'ending.Ted', 'Danson', 'James', 'Van', 'Praagh', 'who', 'inherited', 'gift', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'dead', 'deny', 'contacted', 'group', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'finally', 'boys', 'persistence', 'fact', 'murders', 'are', 'continuing', 'need', 'help', 'stop', 'them.It', 'sufficiently', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'solution', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'acting', 'truly', 'moving', 'story', 'even', 'scene', 'insiders', 'James', 'Van', 'Praagh', 'playing', 'organ', 'story', 'supposedly', 'based', 'life', 'have', 'know', 'what', 'order', 'recognize', 'organ.My', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'dog', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'died', 'hospital', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'touching', 'stories', 'are', 'expressed', 'meetings', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'talk', 'loved', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'died.The', 'story', 'scary', 'done', 'upbeat', 'way', 'death', 'not', 'end', 'continuum']",N/A

His father admonishes his abilities, he almost had a girlfriend until he spooked her, his mother haunts him, and every time he tries to us his abilities something goes wrong.Just as he tries to quit, everyone presses him to go on to help solve a 30-year-old murder with spooky consequences. Is he the victim, the innocent bystander or maybe the perpetrator? Will the case be solved?The film starts out very slow paced, for a while you think you may be watching a religious documentary. It seems to deviate this way and that off course. Then in the second half, the pace picks up and you get absorbed and intrigued as it gets spookier and spookier. By the end you find that the film did not deviate and every word, every gesture forms a tapestry to review an overall picture.A surprising plus is the quality of acting.

998783,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B000G5SI7G,Kathy W,"[0, 0]","Great movie for my spiritual friends.  This true story is about 175 minutes long, and is based on James Van Praagh's #1 New York Times best-seller &#34;Talking to Heaven: A Medium's Message of Life After Death,&#34; and is the complete 2-part mini series.  The movie features several big stars,  Ted Danson plays James Van Praagh, a very famous medium (famous now--not then--in the story).  Jack Palance plays Ted's/James' father; Queen Latifah plays an employee, turned friend, who helps Ted/James accept his inner-self.The movie begins with young James, seeing people and seeing things happen through dimentional portals, but whenever he tries to tell someone, it cause chaos, because they cannot see what James sees.  To make matters worse, he is in Catholic school, so it only convinces teachers he is siding with the devil.  So, James grows up taught to supress all of this supernatural stuff and not even talk about it.  As a matter of fact, he wishes he could just turn it off---but it wasn't meant to be.Fast-forward about 40 years or so, and Mom has a stroke.  James hires a lady to work for him (Queen Latifa), and she begins talking about things her psychic told her, but James said he has had his fill of the supernatural.  She gives him a Ouija Board, and encourages him.  And James begins to see more folks from the other side.  The next thing you know, he begins helping police detective Mary Steenburgen find missing children.  Especially awesome, and the main theme of the movie, is the 7 young (deceased) boys, who take James on a journey toward solving their murders and helping them continue their path on the other side.Walk with James as he experiences the double-edge sword -- the psychic gift and the pain of having and accepting the gift.  For those of you who want to believe there is more to life than most people see and for those of you who believe the dead are closer than most folks think, this movie is very enjoyable.",5,"The life of Van Praagh, beginning as a boy--opening your eyes to a medium's life",1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,1950,"['Great', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'friends', 'true', 'story', '175', 'minutes', 'long', 'based', 'James', 'Van', 'Praagh', '1', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'best-seller', '34', 'Talking', 'Heaven', 'Medium', 'Message', 'Life', 'Death', '34', 'complete', '2-part', 'mini', 'series', 'movie', 'several', 'big', 'stars', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'James', 'Van', 'Praagh', 'very', 'famous', 'medium', 'famous', 'now', 'not', 'then', 'story', 'Jack', 'Palance', ""Ted's/James"", 'father', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'employee', 'turned', 'friend', 'who', 'Ted/James', 'accept', 'inner-self.The', 'movie', 'young', 'James', 'seeing', 'people', 'seeing', 'things', 'happen', 'dimentional', 'portals', 'whenever', 'tell', 'someone', 'chaos', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'James', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Catholic', 'school', 'only', 'teachers', 'siding', 'devil', 'So', 'James', 'up', 'taught', 'supress', 'supernatural', 'stuff', 'not', 'even', 'talk', 'matter', 'fact', 'could', 'just', 'turn', 'off', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be.Fast-forward', '40', 'years', 'so', 'Mom', 'stroke', 'James', 'lady', 'work', 'Queen', 'Latifa', 'talking', 'things', 'psychic', 'told', 'James', 'said', 'had', 'fill', 'supernatural', 'Ouija', 'Board', 'James', 'see', 'more', 'folks', 'other', 'side', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'helping', 'police', 'detective', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'find', 'missing', 'children', 'Especially', 'awesome', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', '7', 'young', 'deceased', 'boys', 'who', 'take', 'James', 'journey', 'solving', 'murders', 'helping', 'continue', 'path', 'other', 'side.Walk', 'James', 'double-edge', 'sword', 'psychic', 'gift', 'pain', 'having', 'accepting', 'gift', 'who', 'want', 'believe', 'more', 'life', 'most', 'people', 'see', 'who', 'believe', 'dead', 'are', 'closer', 'most', 'folks', 'think', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable']",N/A
