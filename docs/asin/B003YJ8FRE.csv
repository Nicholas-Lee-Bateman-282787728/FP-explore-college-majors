Drums pounding and guitars screaming and, well, there's Alice, right in the middle of it all.Some 40 years after Alice first showed us the way to blend visual entertainment with music, the entire show still works and still holds a few surprises, even for the long time fans like myself.  The Blu-Ray disc brings the show to life in ways that will make you appreciate your HDTV and the bonus audio disc allows you to take this wonderful concert on the road with you.You know the songs, you've lived the anthems, you love the characters and you're just a few clicks of the mouse away from having the nice man at the post office deliver a copy of this wonderfully filmed and brilliantly performed show to your doorstep.What on earth could you possibly be waiting for?",5,This stuff never gets old.,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,865,"['smoke', 'brutality', 'stuff', 'flying', 'stage', 'People', 'knives', 'Drums', 'pounding', 'guitars', 'screaming', 'well', 'Alice', 'right', 'middle', '40', 'years', 'Alice', 'first', 'showed', 'way', 'blend', 'visual', 'entertainment', 'music', 'entire', 'show', 'still', 'still', 'few', 'surprises', 'even', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'show', 'life', 'ways', 'will', 'make', 'appreciate', 'HDTV', 'bonus', 'audio', 'disc', 'take', 'wonderful', 'concert', 'road', 'you.You', 'know', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'anthems', 'love', 'characters', ""'re"", 'just', 'few', 'clicks', 'mouse', 'away', 'having', 'nice', 'man', 'post', 'office', 'deliver', 'copy', 'wonderfully', 'filmed', 'brilliantly', 'performed', 'show', 'doorstep.What', 'earth', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'waiting']",N/A

Oh, I remember when I was a lot younger, the things that were said about Vincent Damon Furnier. I couldn't have any of his 45's or albums, mother wouldn't allow. He was a shock rocker, and been at it for at least 5 decades. So, he obviously did something very right. Even though &#34;the establishment&#34; didn't think so. So I had to wait a little longer to buy vinyl. He's another who could just stand on stage and do nothing, of course he's above Kid. I said that about him too. This DVD is good. I think the one done in 05 might be better. My poor husband 20 years ago I'd crank up my stereo, and he dreaded hearing Alice and so loud. He's gotten to were he can listen to him, but he's not got over the loudness. I tell him &#34;if it's too loud, your to old&#34;. I swear if I live to be 100 it'll be rock n roll and loud. And other kinds of music, and loud!I do have a very old tape of him, quite different from this. Just can't imagine how mother knew. Word of mouth? The stupid reports on the tube?  And look at what they said about Elvis.

1376351,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B003YJ8FRE,Monkdude,"[11, 11]","Thanks to my Dad and his huge record collection, I've been an Alice Cooper fan since birth. I saw him live once back in 2001 and one of my father's friends even managed to dive over a seat and snag a whip Alice threw into the crowd from some poor little kid. Other than KISS (who even claim to have stolen the over-the-top stage theatrics idea from Alice), nobody puts on a live show like him. There are 26 songs on both the Blu-ray and CD that were recorded in December 2009. The DVD runs for a little over 90 minutes and the CD is about 80 minutes long, but no songs are cut. The 10 missing minutes from the CD is the time he spends on stage doing his typical crazy stuff that we all love.The picture and sound quality are top notch. Alice Cooper still sounds very good live and the band hits all the right notes. I also liked the all over the place song selection. You still get most of the classics, but we get a song here and there from the more recent albums too. This stage show blows away the one I saw some 9 Halloweens ago. Alice dies multiple times and we get all kinds of creatures and masked men running around on the stage.If you're a fan this is a must buy of course. I've seen his other live DVD releases and this is my favorite by far. I can't wait to watch it again. Maybe I'll blast it Halloween night and scare all the kids away. More candy for me.

1376352,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B003YJ8FRE,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[1, 1]","I was rather hesitant to buy this Blu-Ray performance of Alice Cooper live, because I just recently watched his previously released Blu-Ray release of ""Alice Cooper Live at Montreux"", and I just wasn't too impressed.  I even rented it twice to confirm to myself that I just wasn't all too impressed with that performance.  But, after seeing all these five star reviews of this performance, I figure that I can't go wrong picking this one up.  And I sure am glad that I did.Don't think for a minute that just because Alice Cooper is in his early sixties, doesn't mean the he's too old to behave like a convincing mischievous child on stage, because he's just as wonderfully immature as ever!  And he still has his wonderful raw voice that we are all so familiar with.  And don't think that just because he's in his early sixties that he's going to look like some old man (a convalescent home, nurse-fed, bed-ridden, death candidate), because Alice has always looked like the Frankenstein clone we've all imagined him to continue to be.  He may have put on a few extra pounds (but, haven't we all?), and it may take less applied make-up to make him look scary, but that's what we expect from the legendary Alice Cooper.And all his warped theatrics are here. The guillotine trick, the sloppy, skanky, psychotic nurse, and, of course, Alice as the baby killer himself strikes again!  It's all here, gruesome and tasteless as ever.Now, if they would just release Alice Cooper's ""Brutally Live"" from 2000 onto High Definition Blu-Ray, I'd be a totally satisfied, happy degenerate myself.",5,You can't go wrong with this performance,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,1581,"['was', 'rather', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'performance', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'live', 'just', 'recently', 'watched', 'previously', 'released', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Live', 'Montreux', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'even', 'rented', 'twice', 'confirm', 'myself', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'too', 'impressed', 'performance', 'seeing', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'performance', 'figure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'picking', 'one', 'up', 'sure', 'am', 'glad', 'did.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'minute', 'just', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'early', 'sixties', ""n't"", 'mean', 'too', 'old', 'behave', 'convincing', 'mischievous', 'child', 'stage', 'just', 'wonderfully', 'immature', 'ever', 'still', 'wonderful', 'raw', 'voice', 'are', 'so', 'familiar', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'early', 'sixties', 'going', 'look', 'old', 'man', 'convalescent', 'home', 'nurse-fed', 'bed-ridden', 'death', 'candidate', 'Alice', 'always', 'looked', 'Frankenstein', 'clone', ""'ve"", 'imagined', 'continue', 'be', 'may', 'have', 'put', 'few', 'extra', 'pounds', 'have', ""n't"", 'may', 'take', 'less', 'applied', 'make-up', 'make', 'look', 'scary', 'what', 'expect', 'legendary', 'Alice', 'Cooper.And', 'warped', 'theatrics', 'are', 'here', 'guillotine', 'trick', 'sloppy', 'skanky', 'psychotic', 'nurse', 'course', 'Alice', 'baby', 'killer', 'strikes', 'again', 'here', 'gruesome', 'tasteless', 'ever.Now', 'would', 'just', 'release', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Brutally', 'Live', '2000', 'High', 'Definition', 'Blu-Ray', ""'d"", 'be', 'totally', 'satisfied', 'happy', 'degenerate']",N/A
