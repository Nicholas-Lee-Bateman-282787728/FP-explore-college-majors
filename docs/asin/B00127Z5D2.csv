1136044,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B00127Z5D2,Alric the Red,"[3, 3]","This series was one fine example of great science fiction and drama.  It had an intriguing premise, executed with sharp direction, clear writing, and an excellent cast.  There were never any segues, and the confident pace established trust, never stirring suspicions that the writers might be making it up as they went along.  Like LOST, it got more complex as it went along (though not nearly as labyrinthine).  It was one of those series that, if you didn't get in on it at the beginning (which I didn't), it would be difficult to catch up.  This is probably why, despite all that was good about the series, it never gained an audience and the network canceled it before the conclusion.  But kudos to the network for taking the chance, and more importantly, having enough respect for the viewers to complete a final episode, even if it wasn't aired.  And it's here, in this DVD set.  There are so many examples of creators of shows like these, simply driving away after the ratings fail, leaving us in the middle of the desert.  For not abandoning us, the network should be commended.If you enjoy fresh original television, I highly recommend you pick this up, and then spread the word.  The series deserves a bigger fanbase, and is just too good to let whither illustriously in dusty back annals of TV history.  I bet you could bring it up to your friends and they'd have no idea what you were talking about.Whatever.  The good thing is, now you can see the entire series, right up to its satisfying conclusion.  The picture quality is rich and clear, with a lot of detail, even though it's in SD.  And there are lots of extra features to boot, such as featurettes and commentaries by different cast members, writers, and producers.  And let's not overlook the presence of Moon Bloodgood as Rita Shelton, love interest to Detective Hopper (Taye Diggs).  Moon is a woman I'd like to see grace more often our screens at home and in theaters, as her beauty has a serene warmth to it.  It's always nice to see her._________________________________________",5,It deserves a cult following,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,2054,"['series', 'was', 'one', 'fine', 'example', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'drama', 'had', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'executed', 'sharp', 'direction', 'clear', 'writing', 'excellent', 'cast', 'were', 'never', 'segues', 'confident', 'pace', 'established', 'trust', 'never', 'stirring', 'suspicions', 'writers', 'might', 'be', 'making', 'up', 'went', 'along', 'LOST', 'got', 'more', 'complex', 'went', 'along', 'not', 'nearly', 'labyrinthine', 'was', 'one', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'catch', 'up', 'probably', 'why', 'was', 'good', 'series', 'never', 'gained', 'audience', 'network', 'canceled', 'conclusion', 'network', 'taking', 'chance', 'more', 'importantly', 'having', 'enough', 'respect', 'viewers', 'complete', 'final', 'episode', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'aired', 'here', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'examples', 'creators', 'shows', 'simply', 'driving', 'away', 'ratings', 'fail', 'leaving', 'middle', 'desert', 'not', 'abandoning', 'network', 'should', 'be', 'commended.If', 'enjoy', 'fresh', 'original', 'television', 'highly', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'then', 'spread', 'word', 'series', 'bigger', 'fanbase', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'let', 'illustriously', 'dusty', 'back', 'annals', 'TV', 'history', 'bet', 'could', 'bring', 'up', 'friends', ""'d"", 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'were', 'talking', 'about.Whatever', 'good', 'thing', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'right', 'up', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'picture', 'quality', 'rich', 'clear', 'lot', 'detail', 'even', 'SD', 'are', 'lots', 'extra', 'features', 'boot', 'such', 'featurettes', 'commentaries', 'different', 'cast', 'members', 'writers', 'producers', 'let', 'not', 'overlook', 'presence', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'Rita', 'Shelton', 'love', 'interest', 'Detective', 'Hopper', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'Moon', 'woman', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'grace', 'more', 'often', 'screens', 'home', 'theaters', 'beauty', 'serene', 'warmth', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'her._________________________________________']",N/A
1136045,A132FCKZZYSHBY,B00127Z5D2,baylor,"[5, 5]","On a shopping binge i picked up the first season of a lot of shows - Mad Men, White Collar, Dexter, Six Feet Under, Veronica Mars, Numb3rs and a few other whose names i'd heard and were highly hyped. i found this cheap and it sounded like a detective Groundhog Day so figured i wasn't risking a lot of money. Boy was i surprised - this was BY FAR the best TV series i picked up. Had a friend over and we watched episode after episode wanting it to not end (although my friend liked that it ended before it got old).Here's the basic idea - a cop is framed for murder, his day goes poorly, he wakes up the next morning and it all starts over again. His hope is that if he finds out who framed him (or more appropriately, who heads the shadowy organization that framed him), the day will end and life will go on. A detective Groundhog Day. Within a few episodes you learn one thing is different - any damage (or gunshot wounds) he receives are still there the next day. Not the bandages that kept him alive, just the wounds. So, unlike Bill Murray, he can't just do anything, he has to try to stay alive.A few more episodes go by and you learn that the day CAN change. There are several people who are important to him, each with a problem, a problem that ultimately causes him problems. If he solve that person's problem, the next day that person ""feels"" different and does something to make his day easier. For example, his partner has an issue that causes a death every night. Once he solves her problem, from every day forward, she solves her own problem and he has one less death to worry about. Solving other people's problems helps solve his problems, little by little.A few more episodes go by and you learn that he isn't the only person who can tell when the day repeats. This part could have been developed better and perhaps would have been had the show not been cut short.So it's not exactly Groundhog Day. It's also not a comedy and he's not stuck in place - every day he researches a clue and tries to remember it so that the next day he can learn a little more, eventually working his way to the bad guy. You watch him make progress little by little, and it's interesting to see.i buy a lot of cheap stuff and i'm almost always disappointed but this month has been good - i picked up Fast Forward (another canceled show) that is fantastic and this one, which is better than fantastic. Since i also liked FireFly (another show canceled in its first season), maybe i just like shows everyone else hates.

1136058,A1IXLZSQPMQ0ZL,B00127Z5D2,Horace G,"[0, 0]","I think this show is a must buy at 19.99. This show is special, in a way that I really haven't ever seen before. The show's premise is like Groundhog Day, but I think it works even better in this case. If you like watching detective shows, where the plot sort of unfolds in one hour, then you will LOVE this show because it unfolds over the season, brilliantly. Brett Hopper is repeating the same day over and over again, and he learns so much from every character, what they were going through that day, and it's almost scary to think about his relationships and how shaky they really were. But you come to see that he is a fast learner, and really the day repeating is the only way to allow him to find the truth.

I watched the entire Day Break tv show this week and I just finished the last episode last night.  This is, by far, one of the best tv shows I have ever seen.  So, why am I'm angry... because it was canceled!  I knew it was canceled before I started watching it, but I didnt expect the show to be that good.  I assumed it was canceled because it wasnt good enough to compete with other shows.  So many of the shows I watch has been canceled recently.  Shows like Moonlight, Deadzone, 4400, and Journeyman.  Though I love these shows, deep in my heart I knew that they were'nt up to the standards set by other shows in their genre (Heroes and Lost).  My mistake, Journeyman was up to the standard and was also an excellent show, but I can imagine it was hard to get into if you missed the first few episodes.  Day Break may have had the same problem, but I feel like the network could have done a better job in helping the show find it's audience.  Replay the first episode, try different timeslots, whatever.  Anyway, I'm starting feel better... I think I needed to vent.  I give it 5 stars for this dvd set.  Though I would have enjoyed watching interviews on the cancellation of the show find out where they had plan on taking it next.  The show is excellent.  Great acting and great storyline.  I have to applaud the writers, because they made each and every episode different even though the same day was repeating.  One positive thing about the ending of the show was that everything was wrapped up at the end.  I wanted more because I enjoyed the ride, but at least the storyline of that season was completly wrapped up.

1136071,AJQBZTED5BJCA,B00127Z5D2,One Sad TiVO Monkey,"[5, 6]","I was very happy with the price that I paid for this DVD set. I give my thanks to the other reviewers who pointed out that the packaging is cheap, the shows have a lot of compression artifacts, the ""extras"" are minimal and there are no subtitles for the hard of hearing. That's acceptable given the price. It's a really good show.Day Break (two words, not one like in the product description) was a short lived series on ABC during the 2006 season. ABC pulled it after airing just six episodes but allowed the company to resolve the show and put the remaining show out on the web. It is a really good series and i am baffled about why they cancelled it after just six episodes. Maybe the show was too complex to retain viewers. I can understand that since I had to review prior scenes a few times to understand the plot. Subtitles would have helped with the understanding. Also, the picture was very dark and murky at times. At first I thought that it was from the low-budget compression but it turns out that it was just the way the show was produced.The basic story is simple - Detective Brett Hopper is accused of murdering a district attorney. He says that he's framed and tries to prove his innocence. The twist is that he relives the same day over and over again. Unlike the movie Groundhog Day, his injuries carry through from day to day and he continues to age. nice touches are things like his beard growing and him getting hungry from not eating the ""day before.""What I liked about this series was the character development. Not only does Brett have to save himself, he has to save the people that he loves. He resolves issues with his family, his girlfriend and his partner. Even characters that in other shows would just be stereotypes to support the plot are given a chance to evolve. For example, his sister Jen's husband is initially presented as an abusive man who happily turns brett over to the bad guys. Over the season we find out that he's actually a scared man trying to protect his family. In one conversation with Jen we see the whole issue turned inside out.What i didn't like about it was the way that Brett's sense of morality degrades throughout the series. at one point Chad (his girlfriend's ex-husband) asks Brett why he just doesn't walk into the station with a sub-machine gun and get what he wants by force.

After watching just the first episode of Day Break, I was instantly hooked. This show is finely written, with a thought-provoking story line and wonderfully created characters. As expected, Bloodgood is fantastic, but  Taye Diggs absolutely dominates in his role as Detective Hopper-- the man is an amazing talent. The rest of the cast holds their own too, especially Adam Baldwin as Diggs' nemesis.Not surprising that a show this good couldn't survive on network television (much like the aforementioned Journeyman).

It's tricky as it is risky, sophisticated, avant garde and needs a bit oftime and exposure to get into your head. Once there you'll appreciate the complex script,characters and unorthodox concept.No, it's not a knock off of GROUNDHOGS DAY; DAY BREAK a whole other animal, very sophisticated and put together to draw you in.  You will get hooked; buy not right away. Its complexity will challenge you. Unlike many TV plots today, thinking is required. And shrewd observation and the realization that what's obvious isn't all there is.It will take some (very enjoyable) deductions  to get into the right mindset. Once there you'll really be challenged and certainly edge-of-your-sofa entertained.Your perception should be, as a bad guy character says, that decisions lead to consequences. Maybe it was Aristotle who first thought up the line, like 'for ever cause there are many effects; for every effect, many causes. There are many clever causes and effects here. All real, all believable and mostly exciting.It  took me two viewings to get what was going down. Three to really appreciate the finewriting and so-unique concept and direction. A virtue with DAY BREAK is that you'll be able tosee it many times and each time see, enjoy more. I'm now looking forward very much to re-viewand expect to view again.Production, from acting to editing, posh green LA venues to hot women and either cool or cruelmen is first-class. I lived and working in media writing and never saw better locations. In all, DB is the best mini-series I've seen in a long while. It should've, could've been a major theatrical release. It would have been a sensation with its new actors and attitudes and action. The deep, complex plot'sa wonder.And wonder of wonders, the more the onion's peeled the better it gets. The final denouement isbelievable and hard to believe at the same time. Give it time, you'll see what's what. I watched as I, under my breath kept saying ""aha and oh yeah and (expletive deleted)now I get it. DB's an education In the Making Of segments you'll see some dedicated young filmmakers talking about the risks they took and why the risks were worth it, whether they were accepted or not by some viewers. I agreed. For me everything in DB was worth it; surprising and memorable. I'll wait a month or months and see it all again.Surprisingly, seeing it more than once, the surprise quotient stays high. Mostly when surprises are revealed it's a rush. Will you guess the surprises? Many will, many will hit replay to go back to the scene and see what led to the consequences.Taye Diggs is perfectly cast as a hard cop with compassion, one who makes mistakes and accepts the humanity (failings included) of other characters, good or bad people - and those lines are blurred throughout the595 MINUTES. Every character is real and human as can be. They're mostly familiar faces and a great very balanced, true to live ensemble.Okay, enough raving. This fine show lasted one season? The rumors that bean counters lack taste and and feel viewers are are mostly oblivious.

1136078,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00127Z5D2,trebe,"[9, 9]","Day Break (2006) is an extremely complicated crime drama that was cancelled after only six of the thirteen episodes in the series had aired.  The whacky central premise is that Brett Hopper (Taye Diggs), a police detective accused of murder, is continually reliving the same day.  Using information that he learns from his past experiences, Hopper attempts to solve the murder, and discover the secret to what seems to be an ever expanding mystery.The entire series, including the seven unaired episodes are in this set.  Due to its non-linear constantly evolving plotline, and focus on the time element, Day Break lends itself extremely well to DVD, where the episodes can be viewed one after another, and the characters and plot elements are perhaps easier to remember and keep track of.The story begins on what is called ""Day 2"" with Brett Hopper waking up at 6:18am in the apartment of his girlfriend Rita Shelten (Moon Bloodgood).  Hopper soon discovers that he is wanted for the murder of district attorney Alberto Garza, a man he has never met.  While trying to avoid capture by the police, Hopper turns to various people for help, including his current partner Andrea Battle (Victoria Pratt), his sister Jennifer Mathis (Meta Golding), Damien Ortiz (Ramon Rodriguez) a criminal informant, and Chad Shelten (Adam Baldwin) his ex-partner, and Rita's ex-husband.A detailed plot synopsis would be a challenge and take too long, as numerous events, even the death of various characters, are frequently negated when Hopper's day ""resets"" to ""Day 2"".  One long continuous nonlinear adventure, Day Break has to be seen in chronological order, to be truly understood and appreciated for the amazing experience that it is.  The writing is absolutely first class, continually keeping you off balance, until finally the numerous overlapping events and conspiracies, evolve and meld into one coherent event.  Several times, the story seems to be resolved, only to restart again.  At one point Brett and Rita are relaxing on a beach in Mexico, but even while there Hopper's day is repeating, compelling him to resume the search for the truth.From beginning to end, Taye Diggs is simply outstanding in what is an extremely challenging role.  Much like 24's Jack Bauer, Hopper is put into all kinds of unlikely situations, but he has the advantage of remembering what has happened in the past, which helps him to prevent disaster and death, and also helps him to make progress faster.  Has the story proceeds, Hopper learns to expect the day to reset, and he becomes more methodical, and less emotional about the events that happen.Moon Bloodgood is also excellent, as her character Rita goes through almost as many permutations as Hopper.  The terrific supporting cast includes Jonathan Banks, Mitch Pileggi, Ian Anthony Dale, Jim Beaver, Joe Nieves, Michael McGrady, Marlene Forte, Don Franklin, and Bahar Soomekh.  As the story continues, many of the supporting or peripheral characters are thrust into the spotlight, or become a key piece in what seems to be an ever changing puzzle.  None of the acting performances disappoint.ABC deserves some credit for greenlighting Day Break, however with its overly complicated plot, it was perhaps too much to expect that the series could sustain an audience though 13 episodes.  People may not have been able to figure out what the series was really about, and they were perhaps looking for something with a more obvious direction.  The ratings for Day Break steadily declined until cancellation, but fortunately it is still possible to see the entire series.It you enjoy a convoluted crime drama that requires that you pay close attention, and features great writing and acting, give Day Break a chance.  The series is available in a four disc version, and a lower cost two disc version.  Either one is fine, and the total runtime is about ten hours.  The episodes are subtitled, and each has some kind of commentary track that provides tons of information about the backstory of the series.",5,"a marvelous series that was perhaps just too clever, Day Break never had a chance...",1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,4030,"['Day', 'Break', '2006', 'extremely', 'complicated', 'crime', 'drama', 'was', 'cancelled', 'only', 'six', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'series', 'had', 'aired', 'whacky', 'central', 'premise', 'Brett', 'Hopper', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'police', 'detective', 'accused', 'murder', 'continually', 'reliving', 'same', 'day', 'Using', 'information', 'past', 'experiences', 'Hopper', 'solve', 'murder', 'discover', 'secret', 'what', 'be', 'ever', 'expanding', 'mystery.The', 'entire', 'series', 'including', 'seven', 'unaired', 'episodes', 'are', 'set', 'Due', 'non-linear', 'constantly', 'evolving', 'plotline', 'focus', 'time', 'element', 'Day', 'Break', 'extremely', 'well', 'DVD', 'where', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'one', 'characters', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'perhaps', 'easier', 'remember', 'keep', 'track', 'of.The', 'story', 'what', 'called', 'Day', '2', 'Brett', 'Hopper', 'waking', 'up', '6:18am', 'apartment', 'girlfriend', 'Rita', 'Shelten', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'Hopper', 'soon', 'wanted', 'murder', 'district', 'attorney', 'Alberto', 'Garza', 'man', 'never', 'met', 'trying', 'avoid', 'capture', 'police', 'Hopper', 'various', 'people', 'help', 'including', 'current', 'partner', 'Andrea', 'Battle', 'Victoria', 'Pratt', 'sister', 'Jennifer', 'Mathis', 'Meta', 'Golding', 'Damien', 'Ortiz', 'Ramon', 'Rodriguez', 'criminal', 'informant', 'Chad', 'Shelten', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'ex-partner', 'Rita', 'ex-husband.A', 'detailed', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'would', 'be', 'challenge', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'numerous', 'events', 'even', 'death', 'various', 'characters', 'are', 'frequently', 'negated', 'when', 'Hopper', 'day', 'resets', 'Day', '2', 'One', 'long', 'continuous', 'nonlinear', 'adventure', 'Day', 'Break', 'be', 'seen', 'chronological', 'order', 'be', 'truly', 'understood', 'appreciated', 'amazing', 'experience', 'writing', 'absolutely', 'first', 'class', 'continually', 'keeping', 'balance', 'finally', 'numerous', 'overlapping', 'events', 'conspiracies', 'evolve', 'meld', 'one', 'coherent', 'event', 'Several', 'times', 'story', 'be', 'resolved', 'only', 'restart', 'again', 'one', 'point', 'Brett', 'Rita', 'are', 'relaxing', 'beach', 'Mexico', 'even', 'Hopper', 'day', 'repeating', 'compelling', 'resume', 'search', 'truth.From', 'beginning', 'end', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'what', 'extremely', 'challenging', 'role', 'Much', '24', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Hopper', 'put', 'kinds', 'unlikely', 'situations', 'advantage', 'remembering', 'happened', 'past', 'prevent', 'disaster', 'death', 'also', 'make', 'progress', 'faster', 'story', 'proceeds', 'Hopper', 'expect', 'day', 'reset', 'more', 'methodical', 'less', 'emotional', 'events', 'happen.Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'also', 'excellent', 'character', 'Rita', 'through', 'almost', 'many', 'permutations', 'Hopper', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'Mitch', 'Pileggi', 'Ian', 'Anthony', 'Dale', 'Jim', 'Beaver', 'Joe', 'Nieves', 'Michael', 'McGrady', 'Marlene', 'Forte', 'Don', 'Franklin', 'Bahar', 'Soomekh', 'story', 'many', 'supporting', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'are', 'thrust', 'spotlight', 'become', 'key', 'piece', 'what', 'be', 'ever', 'changing', 'puzzle', 'None', 'acting', 'performances', 'disappoint.ABC', 'credit', 'greenlighting', 'Day', 'Break', 'however', 'overly', 'complicated', 'plot', 'was', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'expect', 'series', 'could', 'sustain', 'audience', '13', 'episodes', 'People', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'series', 'was', 'really', 'about', 'were', 'perhaps', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'obvious', 'direction', 'ratings', 'Day', 'Break', 'steadily', 'declined', 'cancellation', 'fortunately', 'still', 'possible', 'see', 'entire', 'series.It', 'enjoy', 'convoluted', 'crime', 'drama', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'great', 'writing', 'acting', 'give', 'Day', 'Break', 'chance', 'series', 'available', 'four', 'disc', 'version', 'lower', 'cost', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'one', 'fine', 'total', 'runtime', 'about', 'ten', 'hours', 'episodes', 'are', 'subtitled', 'kind', 'commentary', 'track', 'tons', 'information', 'backstory', 'series']",N/A
