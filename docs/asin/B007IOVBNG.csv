1531412,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B007IOVBNG,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[9, 9]","17 year old Tim Cartright decides to do his senior history paper on his father's death in the Gulf War, only to find, once he starts doing research, that there is no record of his father (or anyone else from Kansas) dying in that struggle.  Whenever he gets close to finding out what really happened, a new, seemingly insurmountable roadblock is put in his way, and he starts being followed by someone who identified himself as an FBI agent. His mother is also secretive regarding the details of his father's death, and apparently arranged for Tim to no longer have to do the paper, though his curiosity can't let him stop now.All of this happens during the hectic final months of his senior year in high school, with his girlfriend obsessed with plans for the prom.  As he has since they were little kids, Tim relies heavily on his friend Austin, who has grown into a self-assured young gay man who gets Tim out of some nasty situations. The mystery uncovers his father's notes about UFOs, a war monument that seems to have changed since Tim saw it as a child, and a newspaper story that disappeared from all microfiche and archive copies of that edition.This is a well-conceived, capably written (and directed) emotional story, extremely ambitious for an indie film with a limited budget.  The one negative is some over-acting by several in the cast (including Michael Gordon as Tim, and Danielle Wolverton as his mother), though Mark Ayesh (as Tim's friend Austin) scores a touchdown with a fully-nuanced, engaging character portrayal. There is a surprise ending I was not at all expecting, which is especially rare in a low budget film like this. Don't miss this one.  Four stars out of five.DVD extras include only director commentary.  Not rated, would likely be a PG at most.",4,"Excellent, suspenseful story, rare in a low-budget indie.",1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,1782,"['17', 'year', 'old', 'Tim', 'Cartright', 'do', 'senior', 'history', 'paper', 'father', 'death', 'Gulf', 'War', 'only', 'find', 'once', 'doing', 'research', 'record', 'father', 'anyone', 'else', 'Kansas', 'dying', 'struggle', 'Whenever', 'close', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'new', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'roadblock', 'put', 'way', 'being', 'followed', 'someone', 'who', 'identified', 'FBI', 'agent', 'mother', 'also', 'secretive', 'regarding', 'details', 'father', 'death', 'apparently', 'arranged', 'Tim', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'do', 'paper', 'curiosity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'now.All', 'hectic', 'final', 'months', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'obsessed', 'plans', 'prom', 'were', 'little', 'kids', 'Tim', 'heavily', 'friend', 'Austin', 'who', 'grown', 'self-assured', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'Tim', 'nasty', 'situations', 'mystery', 'father', 'notes', 'UFOs', 'war', 'monument', 'have', 'changed', 'Tim', 'saw', 'child', 'newspaper', 'story', 'disappeared', 'microfiche', 'archive', 'copies', 'edition.This', 'well-conceived', 'capably', 'written', 'directed', 'emotional', 'story', 'extremely', 'ambitious', 'indie', 'film', 'limited', 'budget', 'one', 'negative', 'over-acting', 'several', 'cast', 'including', 'Michael', 'Gordon', 'Tim', 'Danielle', 'Wolverton', 'mother', 'Mark', 'Ayesh', 'Tim', 'friend', 'Austin', 'touchdown', 'fully-nuanced', 'engaging', 'character', 'portrayal', 'surprise', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'especially', 'rare', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'Four', 'five.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'only', 'director', 'commentary', 'Not', 'rated', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'PG', 'most']",War Stories

However, the story is really about relationships - between a boy and his dad,and between him and all the other people who impact his teenage life -- girlfriend, mom, etc. But no relationship stands out as a greater source of strength than the character's great best friend - a non-shit-taking, emancipated minor who takes care of business, and who just happens to be gay.A lot of care went into the plot of this movie - all the clues make sense - in a Crying Game sort of way.It gets only four stars because even after being warned how terrible the mother was, I was still unprepared.",4,Really great movie,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,671,"['real', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'movie', 'hit', 'right', 'marks', 'felt', 'lot', 'X-files', 'However', 'story', 'really', 'relationships', 'boy', 'dad', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'impact', 'teenage', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'mom', 'etc', 'relationship', 'out', 'greater', 'source', 'strength', 'character', 'great', 'best', 'friend', 'non-shit-taking', 'emancipated', 'minor', 'who', 'care', 'business', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'gay.A', 'lot', 'care', 'went', 'plot', 'movie', 'clues', 'make', 'sense', 'Crying', 'Game', 'sort', 'way.It', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'even', 'being', 'warned', 'how', 'terrible', 'mother', 'was', 'was', 'still', 'unprepared']",War Stories

There's some CGI and it's not great and the performances turned in by one of the actors is really quite poor.  But all of that said, there performances by the tennagers were great and I really liked the story a lot.
