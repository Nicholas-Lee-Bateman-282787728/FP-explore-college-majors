1530537,A3D0T6EHDQREDJ,B007FZ7LOG,Cartoon lover,"[0, 0]","It is nice to see this series get a serious release and not compressed onto 6 discs as it has been before. This 10 disc collection is a must have for any 80's baby collector or fan of teddy or parent with child who wants a show with GOOD animation and heart to show their kids. The boxset is packaged really interesting, it is made out of a recycled paper that is condensed and becomes heavy and solid like wood. This thing weighs like 3 pounds I think. There is literally no plastic to this box-set it is all biodegradable paper product with ink. I don't know how I feel about my discs touching rough cardboard like paper so I'll put them in a dvd album, but they arrived unscathed so no fear about receiving scratched discs or anything. But I feel like If I was to keep watching them and putting them in and out of the paper boxes that might cause scratching",4,What a Great collection at great price,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,860,"['nice', 'see', 'series', 'get', 'serious', 'release', 'not', 'compressed', '6', 'discs', 'been', 'before', '10', 'disc', 'collection', 'must', 'have', '80', 'baby', 'collector', 'fan', 'teddy', 'parent', 'child', 'who', 'show', 'GOOD', 'animation', 'heart', 'show', 'kids', 'boxset', 'packaged', 'really', 'interesting', 'made', 'recycled', 'paper', 'condensed', 'heavy', 'solid', 'wood', 'thing', '3', 'pounds', 'think', 'literally', 'plastic', 'box-set', 'biodegradable', 'paper', 'product', 'ink', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'discs', 'touching', 'rough', 'cardboard', 'paper', 'so', ""'ll"", 'put', 'dvd', 'album', 'arrived', 'unscathed', 'so', 'no', 'fear', 'receiving', 'scratched', 'discs', 'anything', 'feel', 'was', 'keep', 'watching', 'putting', 'paper', 'boxes', 'might', 'cause', 'scratching']",Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin

I can dream with this Bear all over again now.When I was a little kid, I use to watch a lot of good shows on TV, back in the 80's; 1984 was the year I was born, and this was released on TV a few years after. Of all the DVD Box Sets I've seen, and or gotten, THIS one is much different from the others; what I mean by that is that it holds two DVD Boxes in one WHOLE box, and holds them side by side. Even though this box mentions a brief history of the famous interactive talking Toy Bear that inspired this show, it doesn't, unlike some DVD boxes, or so I hear rumors about, tell you that they'd be available in the same place where you would buy this. Seeing as how you can now try to find the toy bear here at Amazon, and at an expensive price, I can see why this bear, in toy form, would be a bit hard to find, and buy.This bears (no offense, or pun intended) similarities to Seasons 1 & 2 of He-Man, Season 1 of She-Ra, and the Complete Series of both Filmation's Ghostbusters, and Bravestar, because of the fact that this TV Series ran for a total of 65 Episodes. I only watched the first 5 DVDs in Volume 1, starting with the first 5 Episodes that tell a 5-Part Story, but I plan to start watching Volume 2 sometime soon.Bottom line, I'm taking a trip down memory lane with this special bear, and I am loving every minute of it. In fact, on YouTube, courtesy of a new friend of mine, I like listening to his special lullaby song called, ""Will You Go To Sleep Before I Do"", and it seems to be my favorite, probably because this bear was my favorite bear, and I haven't seen him, or heard his songs, including that one, in such a long time.My vote of 5 stars for this musical, story-telling bear. The adventures in Grundo await.UPDATE: I have finished watching all 65 episodes of this show, and am happy to say that although it left me wondering what would've happened next, I liked how it turned out. Unfortunatelly, before I continued, and finished watching this, a canine member of our Family had gone, and left us. A passing vehicle took her life away. So I decided to finish watching this is honor of her. I miss her...very much.",5,"More of my Childhood, revisiting.",1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,2167,"['Come', 'Dream', 'Tonight', 'can', 'dream', 'Bear', 'over', 'again', 'now.When', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'use', 'watch', 'lot', 'good', 'shows', 'TV', 'back', '80', '1984', 'was', 'year', 'was', 'born', 'was', 'released', 'TV', 'few', 'years', 'DVD', 'Box', 'Sets', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'gotten', 'THIS', 'one', 'much', 'different', 'others', 'what', 'mean', 'two', 'DVD', 'Boxes', 'one', 'WHOLE', 'box', 'side', 'side', 'Even', 'box', 'brief', 'history', 'famous', 'interactive', 'talking', 'Toy', 'Bear', 'inspired', 'show', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'boxes', 'so', 'hear', 'rumors', 'tell', ""'d"", 'be', 'available', 'same', 'place', 'where', 'would', 'buy', 'Seeing', 'how', 'can', 'now', 'try', 'find', 'toy', 'bear', 'here', 'Amazon', 'expensive', 'price', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'bear', 'toy', 'form', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'hard', 'find', 'buy.This', 'bears', 'offense', 'pun', 'intended', 'similarities', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'He-Man', 'Season', '1', 'She-Ra', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Filmation', 'Ghostbusters', 'Bravestar', 'fact', 'TV', 'Series', 'ran', 'total', '65', 'Episodes', 'only', 'watched', 'first', '5', 'DVDs', 'Volume', '1', 'starting', 'first', '5', 'Episodes', 'tell', '5-Part', 'Story', 'plan', 'start', 'watching', 'Volume', '2', 'sometime', 'soon.Bottom', 'line', ""'m"", 'taking', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'special', 'bear', 'am', 'loving', 'minute', 'fact', 'YouTube', 'courtesy', 'new', 'friend', 'mine', 'like', 'listening', 'special', 'lullaby', 'song', 'called', 'Will', 'Go', 'Sleep', 'Do', 'be', 'favorite', 'probably', 'bear', 'was', 'favorite', 'bear', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'heard', 'songs', 'including', 'one', 'long', 'time.My', 'vote', '5', 'stars', 'musical', 'story-telling', 'bear', 'adventures', 'Grundo', 'await.UPDATE', 'have', 'finished', 'watching', '65', 'episodes', 'show', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'happened', 'next', 'liked', 'how', 'turned', 'out', 'Unfortunatelly', 'continued', 'finished', 'watching', 'canine', 'member', 'Family', 'had', 'gone', 'left', 'passing', 'vehicle', 'took', 'life', 'away', 'decided', 'finish', 'watching', 'honor', 'miss', 'very', 'much']",Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin

1530542,AZP335D31XNA7,B007FZ7LOG,RetroMan,"[14, 15]","I am sure if you are here you're a Teddy Ruxpin fan or curious about this show. Well you've hit the right link because this is the Teddy Ruxpin set to buy. The previous Teddy Ruxpin complete set was spread across 6 discs by Mill Creek, this set it's spread over 10 discs which makes compression a lot less taxing on the disc and your player.You get all 65 episodes in their full glory, just like you remember from 1987, Teddy Ruxpin was the best selling toy of 1986 and then came this great cartoon which its plot was spread across all 65 episodes to a satisfying ending. Take it from someone who owns this set the price is right, it'll make a great stocking stuffer or a good present for a Teddy Ruxpin fan. Most of these reviews are from the old Teddy set I mentioned on 6 discs, Amazon has a very bad HABIT of transferring old reviews from previous sets and sticking them on the new editions which helps no one! I don't know if Amazon is ever going to end this practice but at least you can pin the newest release date of a set to the reviews after that date and see it's a review for the new set. I was pleased with the packaging, nice and study and colorful, the price is awesome! Great job Image ent.! I wish they would release more complete sets like this of bygone cartoons we all miss seeing. This cartoon speaks for itself so I hope I was helpful on just letting you know about this latest edition.",5,Teddy Ruxpin 65 episode complete adventures!,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,1408,"['am', 'sure', 'are', 'here', ""'re"", 'Teddy', 'Ruxpin', 'fan', 'curious', 'show', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'hit', 'right', 'link', 'Teddy', 'Ruxpin', 'set', 'buy', 'previous', 'Teddy', 'Ruxpin', 'complete', 'set', 'was', 'spread', '6', 'discs', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'set', 'spread', '10', 'discs', 'compression', 'lot', 'less', 'taxing', 'disc', 'player.You', 'get', '65', 'episodes', 'full', 'glory', 'just', 'remember', '1987', 'Teddy', 'Ruxpin', 'was', 'best', 'selling', 'toy', '1986', 'then', 'came', 'great', 'cartoon', 'plot', 'was', 'spread', '65', 'episodes', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Take', 'someone', 'who', 'set', 'price', 'right', ""'ll"", 'make', 'great', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'good', 'present', 'Teddy', 'Ruxpin', 'fan', 'Most', 'reviews', 'are', 'old', 'Teddy', 'set', 'mentioned', '6', 'discs', 'Amazon', 'very', 'bad', 'HABIT', 'transferring', 'old', 'reviews', 'previous', 'sets', 'sticking', 'new', 'editions', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Amazon', 'ever', 'going', 'end', 'practice', 'least', 'can', 'pin', 'newest', 'release', 'date', 'set', 'reviews', 'date', 'see', 'review', 'new', 'set', 'was', 'pleased', 'packaging', 'nice', 'study', 'colorful', 'price', 'awesome', 'Great', 'job', 'Image', 'ent.', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'more', 'complete', 'sets', 'bygone', 'cartoons', 'miss', 'seeing', 'cartoon', 'speaks', 'so', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful', 'just', 'letting', 'know', 'latest', 'edition']",Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin
1530543,A203K9HA5QWIWE,B007FZ7LOG,Spottedfeather,"[0, 0]","I loved Teddy Ruxpin when I was a kid. Though, I was more familiar with the live action movie. I had never seen the cartoon. Of if I had, I didn't remember it beyond some of the same story that was used in the live action movie. The show is a lot of fun. Sure, the animation can be a bit limited, but you don't really notice it after a while. The only thing that could make this set better would be if there was some sort of bonus features. The video quality, for the most part, is that of a very high quality VHS tape....which is fine. It reminds me of the quality of video in the 80s when I was a kid, which is nice.The only bad thing about the set is the way it's packaged. The discs are stuck on little rubber nubs instead of the standard plastic dvd nubs. When the discs are in the cardboard trays, they sit right against the cardboard. This is a big no-no for anyone that knows about dvds and movies. My set didn't have any major damage, and the discs seem to play fine...so far. It would have been MUCH better had the discs been in standard plastic keepcases.....NOT stacked on top of each other as sets like these tend to do.",4,"""New"" Childhood Favourite !",1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,1133,"['loved', 'Teddy', 'Ruxpin', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'more', 'familiar', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'cartoon', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'same', 'story', 'was', 'used', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'show', 'lot', 'fun', 'Sure', 'animation', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'limited', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'while', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'make', 'set', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'sort', 'bonus', 'features', 'video', 'quality', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'VHS', 'tape', '.which', 'fine', 'quality', 'video', '80s', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'nice.The', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'set', 'way', 'packaged', 'discs', 'are', 'stuck', 'little', 'rubber', 'nubs', 'instead', 'standard', 'plastic', 'dvd', 'nubs', 'When', 'discs', 'are', 'cardboard', 'trays', 'sit', 'right', 'cardboard', 'big', 'no-no', 'anyone', 'dvds', 'movies', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'major', 'damage', 'discs', 'seem', 'play', 'fine', 'so', 'far', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'MUCH', 'better', 'had', 'discs', 'been', 'standard', 'plastic', 'keepcases', '..NOT', 'stacked', 'top', 'other', 'sets', 'tend', 'do']",Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin
