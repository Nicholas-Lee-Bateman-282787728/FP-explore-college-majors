IF you want good Tenchi DVD's check out the Tenchi Muyo OVA, that is the best of the best.  This series is okay, but never will be as great as the original.",4,It's Tenchi... but that;s about it,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,498,"['only', 'reasons', 'can', 'give', 'DVD', '4stars', '1', 'Ryoko', 'basically', 'TEnchi', 'end', '2', 'shocking', 'way', 'Yugi', 'fought', '3', 'Tenchi', 'DVD', 'opinion', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'gets.Sadly', 'TEnchi', 'Tokyo', 'Shin', 'Tenchi', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'series', 'plots', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'even', 'animation', 'lacking', 'IF', 'want', 'good', 'Tenchi', 'DVD', 'check', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'OVA', 'best', 'best', 'series', 'okay', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'original']",N/A
517364,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00003CWHL,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","This isn't my favorite Tenchi series, but it's still pretty good. This show starts out with the girls already living at the Masaki home. Tenchi has decided to go to Tokyo to study under a priest and continue high school. The girls are not happy about this obviously. Washu invents a tunnel that can transport them back and forth from the house to Tenchi's apartment. When he arrive in Tokyo he meets a cute girl named Sakuya. She seems normal, and that's a nice change for Tenchi. After they spend more time together things get kind of ugly with the others.After apparently losing Sakuya to the evil Yugi. Tenchi and the girls come together again and storm Yugi's crystal fortress. Defeating her will not be easy. Especially with the fate of Sakuya inexorably tied to Yugi. Sakuya is no more than a fragment of Yugi's soul broken off to achieve the goal of breaking Tenchi's friends apart. The conclusion is pretty shocking, but there is a reason to hope for a bright future.This is a different look at a very familiar series. The animation is different, and I like the new character, but overall it falls short of the original series, and Tenchi Universe.",4,A sad ending.

517365,A2O0CFU9Q9XK3,B00003CWHL,"""madnessmark""","[0, 0]","The grand finally to Tenchi in Tokyo should be a must-have for any Tenchi fan. As Sakuya is driven mad by the fact she knows nothing of her past, Washu discovers that Sakuya is actually a shadow of Yugi. Meanwhile, Kiyone and Mihoshi finish off Subaru and Ryoko takes care of Hotsuma. Yugi takes back control Sakuya, turns to Tokyo to crystal and has Sasami in her custody. Tenchi confronts Yugi with two options. Either he can stay in a dream world with Sakuya forever or sacrafice Sakuya to safe the earth. Tenchi says good bye to Sakuya and Ryoko, Aieka, Kiyone, Mihoshi and Washu all come to Tenchi's aid as well as Sasami. Tenchi summons up the ultimate sword (or power, whatever) and goes after Yugi. Suprisingly, instead of slicing Yugi with the sword, he just slaps some sense into her and comforts her. The show ends up with Yugi putting herself in sleep-mode until she is all grown up. Overall, I liked the ending as it serves up as the most intense volume ever. If you were confused about the last episodes, see this one. It will answer all your questions. Tenchi in Tokyo might not be everyone's favorite of the Tenchi saga, but it is still great.",5,A fare ending to a fare series,979430400,"01 14, 2001",2001,1159,"['grand', 'finally', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'should', 'be', 'must-have', 'Tenchi', 'fan', 'Sakuya', 'driven', 'mad', 'fact', 'nothing', 'past', 'Washu', 'Sakuya', 'actually', 'shadow', 'Yugi', 'Meanwhile', 'Kiyone', 'Mihoshi', 'finish', 'off', 'Subaru', 'Ryoko', 'care', 'Hotsuma', 'Yugi', 'back', 'control', 'Sakuya', 'Tokyo', 'crystal', 'Sasami', 'custody', 'Tenchi', 'confronts', 'Yugi', 'two', 'options', 'can', 'stay', 'dream', 'world', 'Sakuya', 'forever', 'sacrafice', 'Sakuya', 'safe', 'earth', 'Tenchi', 'good', 'bye', 'Sakuya', 'Ryoko', 'Aieka', 'Kiyone', 'Mihoshi', 'Washu', 'come', 'Tenchi', 'aid', 'as', 'well', 'Sasami', 'Tenchi', 'up', 'ultimate', 'sword', 'power', 'Yugi', 'Suprisingly', 'instead', 'slicing', 'Yugi', 'sword', 'just', 'slaps', 'sense', 'show', 'up', 'Yugi', 'putting', 'sleep-mode', 'grown', 'up', 'Overall', 'liked', 'ending', 'up', 'most', 'intense', 'volume', 'ever', 'were', 'confused', 'last', 'episodes', 'see', 'one', 'will', 'answer', 'questions', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Tenchi', 'saga', 'still', 'great']",N/A

As the family comes back together, they each and everyone show that trust and love can truly combine their skills and powers.  Each minion of Yugi's is taken out of action and in the end, with the others' help, Tenchi goes after Yugi herself, armed with a sword made from all the crystals his mother left him.  He must win because if Tenchi fails the Earth is doomed.But if he kills Yugi he also kills her shadow, the girl he loves, Sakuya!  The ending is somewhat of a surprise, but given Tenchi's nature, maybe it shouldn't of surprised me as much as it did.I happen to really enjoy the fight between Ryoko and Hotsuma, and the final episode is both touching and very funny.  I also happen to be a fan of Yugi, I really enjoyed her character, even if her fashion sense was a tad on the blah side.",5,The last of the Tenchi In Tokyo DVDs.,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,876,"['DVD', 'four', 'episodes', 'giving', 'viewer', 'great', 'ending', 'story', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'everyone', 'show', 'trust', 'love', 'can', 'truly', 'combine', 'skills', 'powers', 'minion', 'Yugi', 'taken', 'action', 'end', 'others', 'help', 'Tenchi', 'Yugi', 'armed', 'sword', 'made', 'crystals', 'mother', 'left', 'must', 'win', 'Tenchi', 'Earth', 'doomed.But', 'also', 'shadow', 'girl', 'Sakuya', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'surprise', 'given', 'Tenchi', 'nature', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'as', 'much', 'happen', 'really', 'enjoy', 'fight', 'Ryoko', 'Hotsuma', 'final', 'episode', 'touching', 'very', 'funny', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'fan', 'Yugi', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'even', 'fashion', 'sense', 'was', 'tad', 'blah', 'side']",N/A
517367,A1U0G0F4LTIYEP,B00003CWHL,Phil Humphrey,"[3, 4]","The last chapter in the Tenchi in Tokyo series is a worthy ending, and it's only at this point that several of the key questions are finally answered. At this stage we know roughly who Yugi is, but what is her  interest and involvement with the Masaki family, and what are her motives,  all is revealed in these final episodes. These final few chapters bring  together all the past elements of the series, including some of the events,  which at the time may have seemed a little strange or unrelated, but now  can be explained, plus this DVD includes the pivotal final battle between  Tenchi and Yugi. If like me, you bought the first Tenchi in Tokyo chapters,  then simply had to buy the rest to follow the unravelling story, this final  addition will not disappoint. The quality of the animation, like the entire  Tokyo series, being TV derived is not quite up to the quality seen in the  OAV series, however it has a unique style and in some ways is more real and  the characters more expressive than seen in the OAV box set. I recommend  this Tokyo series to anyone who has the OVA set and wants more. The quality  may not be as good but the overall story, being slightly less fluffy makes  up for any other short fallings. Does Ryoko or Ayeka ever get Tenchi?

She gets very frightened and she won't let Tenchi do anything without her. Things keep building and the tension keeps growing... As I watched the end of episode 24, &quot;Yugi's Shadow&quot;, I couldn't help but cry. This is one of the saddest anime episodes ever. &quot;why did they have to do that??? i liked Sakuya so much!&quot; This episode definetly knows how to rip your heart out. I don't think there is any sane human who can watch this episode and not feel strong emotions during the Tenchi and Sakuya flashback scene.
