Ever wondered what it would be like coming back to your floating, rather small, island, with half your airplane missing?. Sheer guts abound in this account of life aboard, and aloft from, a typical American fleet carrier. The heroism of the deck crew in throwing caution to the wind to extricate a pilot from his damaged machine, coupled with the sheer courage of pilots approaching a small deck at high speed in the middle of a rather large ocean, is always going to offer something worthwhile watching.

The words above are taken from the film.For security reasons the carrier remains unnamed - but it is aso the story of all carriers that fought in the Pacific. All footage is in colour and shows everything from the barbershops and bakeries to the captain of the ship that never leaves the bridge (even takes his meals up there).The propaganda is smooth, not much Jap bashing but more a story of the boys and men, how a crew with about 75% fresh recruits in a company of 6000 men become one of the greatest weapons of war. The film takes you from their commission - on to their first fighting at Marcus Island and on finally cumulating in the Marianas 'turkey shoot'. All this in one hour. If there is a drawback it is that the DVD is in normal TV aspect ratio but as is obvious from the credits and a few sceens the films original was wider.War film fans will be in for a ride of their lives since all the arial combat is taken from combat films from the planes that fought (through the later part of the war a film camera was fitted to combat aircraft and started to record when the gun triggers were activated.)I have seen a few WW2 propaganda films and this is by far the best documentary, beaten only in the overall category by ""Donald Duck in Nutzi Land by Walt Disney"" (Walt Disney Wartime Classics).

579856,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00005B1YF,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[8, 9]","This excellent documentary was produced for war time PROPAGANDA purposes in 1943 and 1944 by the services of communication of US Navy and therefore it has all the limitations of this kind of films. It is however a precious document capturing well a great deal of the atmosphere of life on board of an American aircaft-carrier during WWII in Pacific and also showing lots of most interesting REAL fight footage - and all of this in color! It is also very skillfully done. The narration is of course quite jingoistic, but I believe it reflects quite well the general mood prevailing amongst American fighting men (and women) and the general public during the war.In this film the real name of the aircraft-carrier is never revealed, in order to not give this kind of information to the enemy - the ship is always just called ""The Fighting Lady"". But in fact, the carrier on which we travel, was the USS ""Yorktown"" (CV-10), the second ship in the famous ""Essex"" class (which counted no less than 26 units!). ""Essex"" class carriers were the ones which between 1943 and 1945 allowed the US Navy to comprehensively defeat Imperial Japanese Navy and bring US forces from Southern and Eastern Pacific to the immediate proximity of Japanese home islands. The ""Fighting Lady"" was the second carrier to bear this name - the first ""Yorktown"" was sunk at Midway.The second USS ""Yorktown"" had a very busy war and it is well shown in this documentary, which covers the period from August 1943 to June 1944. During this time we can see the real war footage from the following battles:- raid against Marcus Island (August 1943)- invasion of Kwajalein (January 1944)- the massive raid on Truk, known as operation ""Hailstone"" (February 1944)- the battle of Philippine Sea, the greatest carriers battle in history, also known as ""The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"" (June 19-20, 1944)This is only the selection of battles in which USS ""Yorktown"" participated during this time. Minor actions are not mentioned, but what we see is plenty enough.The narrator is Hollywood actor Robert Taylor, known amongst others for ""Quo Vadis"" and ""Knights of round table"". The music was composed specially for this film and it is so good, that it was since used in many war movies in the 40s and 50s.The film is very well done and very interesting - and the end is extremely moving, but I will not reveal more. Once again, this is PROPAGANDA - but gosh, this is propaganda on the highest possible level! Small wonder, that ""The Fighting Lady"" got the Oscar for best documentary in 1944. Hollywood produced between 1941 and 1945 hundreds of propaganda films and documentaries, but this is probably THE BEST!There are two more reasons for which I found this documentary interesting and moving:- first, after June 1944, USS ""Yorktown"" fought many more battles and some pilots and air crew members we get to know during this film didn't survive the war...- second, the ""Fighting Lady"" still exists. USS ""Yorktown"" remained in service for a long time and even took part in Vietnam War. And since 1975, returned more or less to her WWII aspect, she is a museum-ship, anchored at Mount Pleasant in South Carolina.To conclude, I recommend warmly this interesting propaganda movie, for anybody interested in WWII, the naval history, Hollywood history or propaganda/communication history. I bought the DVD and I am very happy I did it, but if you just want to watch it without buying, if you search well on the internet, it is possible to find this film and see it free of charge, although the quality is not exactly great. On the big screen of the TV it looks better and buying the DVD is therefore more interesting.",5,It is a war time propaganda film - but of the greatest quality!,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,3668,"['excellent', 'documentary', 'was', 'produced', 'war', 'time', 'PROPAGANDA', 'purposes', '1943', '1944', 'services', 'communication', 'US', 'Navy', 'therefore', 'limitations', 'kind', 'films', 'however', 'precious', 'document', 'capturing', 'well', 'great', 'deal', 'atmosphere', 'life', 'board', 'American', 'aircaft-carrier', 'WWII', 'Pacific', 'also', 'showing', 'lots', 'most', 'interesting', 'REAL', 'fight', 'footage', 'color', 'also', 'very', 'skillfully', 'done', 'narration', 'course', 'quite', 'jingoistic', 'believe', 'quite', 'well', 'general', 'mood', 'prevailing', 'amongst', 'American', 'fighting', 'men', 'women', 'general', 'public', 'war.In', 'film', 'real', 'name', 'aircraft-carrier', 'never', 'revealed', 'order', 'not', 'give', 'kind', 'information', 'enemy', 'ship', 'always', 'just', 'called', 'Fighting', 'Lady', 'fact', 'carrier', 'travel', 'was', 'USS', 'Yorktown', 'CV-10', 'second', 'ship', 'famous', 'Essex', 'class', 'counted', 'less', '26', 'units', 'Essex', 'class', 'carriers', 'were', 'ones', '1943', '1945', 'allowed', 'US', 'Navy', 'comprehensively', 'defeat', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'Navy', 'bring', 'US', 'forces', 'Southern', 'Eastern', 'Pacific', 'immediate', 'proximity', 'Japanese', 'home', 'islands', 'Fighting', 'Lady', 'was', 'second', 'carrier', 'bear', 'name', 'first', 'Yorktown', 'was', 'sunk', 'Midway.The', 'second', 'USS', 'Yorktown', 'had', 'very', 'busy', 'war', 'well', 'shown', 'documentary', 'period', 'August', '1943', 'June', '1944', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'real', 'war', 'footage', 'following', 'battles', 'raid', 'Marcus', 'Island', 'August', '1943', 'invasion', 'Kwajalein', 'January', '1944', 'massive', 'raid', 'Truk', 'known', 'operation', 'Hailstone', 'February', '1944', 'battle', 'Philippine', 'Sea', 'greatest', 'carriers', 'battle', 'history', 'also', 'known', 'Great', 'Marianas', 'Turkey', 'Shoot', 'June', '19-20', '1944', 'only', 'selection', 'battles', 'USS', 'Yorktown', 'participated', 'time', 'Minor', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'mentioned', 'what', 'see', 'plenty', 'enough.The', 'narrator', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'known', 'amongst', 'others', 'Quo', 'Vadis', 'Knights', 'round', 'table', 'music', 'was', 'composed', 'specially', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'used', 'many', 'war', 'movies', '40s', '50s.The', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'interesting', 'end', 'extremely', 'moving', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'more', 'Once', 'again', 'PROPAGANDA', 'gosh', 'propaganda', 'highest', 'possible', 'level', 'Small', 'wonder', 'Fighting', 'Lady', 'got', 'Oscar', 'best', 'documentary', '1944', 'Hollywood', 'produced', '1941', '1945', 'hundreds', 'propaganda', 'films', 'documentaries', 'probably', 'THE', 'BEST', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'reasons', 'found', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'moving', 'first', 'June', '1944', 'USS', 'Yorktown', 'fought', 'many', 'more', 'battles', 'pilots', 'air', 'crew', 'members', 'get', 'know', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'war', 'second', 'Fighting', 'Lady', 'still', 'USS', 'Yorktown', 'remained', 'service', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'took', 'part', 'Vietnam', 'War', '1975', 'returned', 'more', 'less', 'WWII', 'aspect', 'museum-ship', 'anchored', 'Mount', 'Pleasant', 'South', 'Carolina.To', 'conclude', 'recommend', 'warmly', 'interesting', 'propaganda', 'movie', 'anybody', 'interested', 'WWII', 'naval', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'propaganda/communication', 'history', 'bought', 'DVD', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'did', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'buying', 'search', 'well', 'internet', 'possible', 'find', 'film', 'see', 'free', 'charge', 'quality', 'not', 'exactly', 'great', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', 'better', 'buying', 'DVD', 'therefore', 'more', 'interesting']",N/A

This hour plus long documentary filmed in color was screened in theaters in 1944 about a couple months or so after the operations had taken place. It shows life aboard this newly commissioned aircraft carrier as it sails southward from its eastern seaboard home port through the Panama Canal, as she was designed too do, and onto her destination, the Pacific Theater of Operations. This gray lady goes on to see much action in the Pacific theater of operations.We see everything from daily life of preparing meals, doing laundry, to the pilots and crews who this great class of ship was built for. And you are aware that ever person on the ship also has a combat station with preassigned duties. The documentary has the first plane landing on the new floating runway through the many hard fought engagements that comprised the attacks on Marcus Island, Kawjalen, Truk, and Battle of the Philippine Sea known as ""The Marianas Turkey Shoot."" All footage if actual combat footage that was extremely well done.Robert Taylor, USNR, does the narration and does an excellent job in explaining what is not only obvious but the feelings the crew felt at the time of the filming. Though his narration does not convey the stress and boredom that waiting for actual combat entails he does share these truths.

579871,AK61LQI92GTCH,B00005B1YF,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[81, 84]","Released in late 1944, winner of an Academy Award as Best Documentary in 1945, William Wyler's THE FIGHTING LADY portrays life aboard  a newly commissioned aircraft carrier as it wends its way southward from its eastern seaboard home port, crosses the Panama Canal, and streams westward to join the naval war in the Pacific theater of operations.  Finally, we are on board planes and boat during a number of enemy engagements.The War Office commissioned a number of these documentaries during the war.  They were made by top-notch Hollywood directors, including John Huston, John Ford, and Wyler.  Probably the best known of these is Frank Capra's early, five-part `Why We Fight' series, the first of which was released in 1942.  I've read that audiences grew increasingly tired of them.  War-weariness had set in, newsreels delivered much more current information, and the typical 60-minute run time was hard to fit onto a playbill.  A Saint or a Boston Blackie or even a Blondie episode would have been a lot easier to sell than a war documentary depicting events that occurred over a year and a half ago.That said, THE FIGHTING LADY is pretty good.  The ship's real name is never revealed. I guess (wasn't told this, either) that it's a Yorktown-class carrier.  The camera gets around fairly comfortably, imparting an idea of how enclosed and self contained life on an aircraft carrier was.  Crewmen bake bread, shave steaks off whole quarters of beeves.  The deck hangar is as huge as a cathedral.  Early on the ship's captain exhorts the crew to greater efficiency, pilots are granted the luxury of pre-battle breakfasts of steak and eggs, and the mutt mascot wags around in a miniature life vest when the ship enters more dangerous waters. The approach is admiring, the tone (with voice-over narration by Robert Taylor) is determined, and the general impression, by 1943, is one of overwhelming material superiority.  By 1945 the subject had changed from `why we fight' to `how we won.'This is the first full color WWII documentary I've seen, and one of the few produced during the war.  After the ship reaches the war zone we're shown a lot of footage of Japanese planes being shot out of sky by the ship's aak-aak guns, land and sea targets strafed and bombed via movie cameras strapped onto airplane guns, and that fellow with the flags on the flight deck guiding the planes in for the always hazardous deckside landings.  Although cameras are smaller, lighter, and steadier today, TFL contains some of the supplest photography I've seen in a contemporary documentary.  It's visually interesting, and not the worst of the lot by a long shot.",4,The Fighting Lady,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2650,"['Released', 'late', '1944', 'winner', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Documentary', '1945', 'William', 'Wyler', 'THE', 'FIGHTING', 'LADY', 'life', 'newly', 'commissioned', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'way', 'southward', 'eastern', 'seaboard', 'home', 'port', 'Panama', 'Canal', 'streams', 'westward', 'join', 'naval', 'war', 'Pacific', 'theater', 'operations', 'Finally', 'are', 'board', 'planes', 'boat', 'number', 'enemy', 'engagements.The', 'War', 'Office', 'commissioned', 'number', 'documentaries', 'war', 'were', 'made', 'top-notch', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'including', 'John', 'Huston', 'John', 'Ford', 'Wyler', 'Probably', 'best', 'known', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'early', 'five-part', 'Why', 'Fight', 'series', 'first', 'was', 'released', '1942', ""'ve"", 'read', 'audiences', 'grew', 'increasingly', 'tired', 'War-weariness', 'had', 'set', 'newsreels', 'delivered', 'much', 'more', 'current', 'information', 'typical', '60-minute', 'run', 'time', 'was', 'hard', 'fit', 'playbill', 'Saint', 'Boston', 'Blackie', 'even', 'Blondie', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'easier', 'sell', 'war', 'documentary', 'depicting', 'events', 'occurred', 'year', 'half', 'said', 'THE', 'FIGHTING', 'LADY', 'pretty', 'good', 'ship', 'real', 'name', 'never', 'revealed', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'told', 'either', 'Yorktown-class', 'carrier', 'camera', 'around', 'fairly', 'comfortably', 'imparting', 'idea', 'how', 'enclosed', 'self', 'contained', 'life', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'was', 'Crewmen', 'bake', 'bread', 'shave', 'steaks', 'off', 'whole', 'quarters', 'beeves', 'deck', 'hangar', 'as', 'huge', 'cathedral', 'Early', 'ship', 'captain', 'crew', 'greater', 'efficiency', 'pilots', 'are', 'granted', 'luxury', 'pre-battle', 'breakfasts', 'steak', 'eggs', 'mutt', 'mascot', 'wags', 'miniature', 'life', 'vest', 'when', 'ship', 'more', 'dangerous', 'waters', 'approach', 'admiring', 'tone', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'determined', 'general', 'impression', '1943', 'one', 'overwhelming', 'material', 'superiority', '1945', 'subject', 'had', 'changed', 'why', 'fight', 'how', 'won', 'first', 'full', 'color', 'WWII', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'few', 'produced', 'war', 'ship', 'war', 'zone', ""'re"", 'shown', 'lot', 'footage', 'Japanese', 'planes', 'being', 'shot', 'sky', 'ship', 'aak-aak', 'guns', 'land', 'sea', 'targets', 'strafed', 'bombed', 'movie', 'cameras', 'strapped', 'airplane', 'guns', 'fellow', 'flags', 'flight', 'deck', 'guiding', 'planes', 'always', 'hazardous', 'deckside', 'landings', 'cameras', 'are', 'smaller', 'lighter', 'steadier', 'today', 'TFL', 'supplest', 'photography', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'contemporary', 'documentary', 'visually', 'interesting', 'not', 'worst', 'lot', 'long', 'shot']",N/A
