I own a lot of barre/ballet exercise DVD'S which provide me with more than enough srength training and some cardio; however, I only had one true cardio workout where you constantly use hand weights. This DVD does it all as far as a non-stop low impact workout! There are quite a few exercises using the gliding discs so I ended up buying a pair. Cathe uses much heavier dumbbells; I use eight pound ones.Once again, great workout!",5,Great workout!!,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,472,"['first', 'Cathe', 'Friedrich', 'workout', 'own', 'lot', 'barre/ballet', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'provide', 'more', 'enough', 'srength', 'training', 'cardio', 'however', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'true', 'cardio', 'workout', 'where', 'constantly', 'use', 'hand', 'weights', 'DVD', 'as', 'far', 'non-stop', 'low', 'impact', 'workout', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'exercises', 'using', 'gliding', 'discs', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'pair', 'Cathe', 'much', 'heavier', 'dumbbells', 'use', 'eight', 'pound', 'ones.Once', 'again', 'great', 'workout']",N/A

The usual non-annoying backup crew, decent cues, non-intrusive music with a beat, high production quality with excellent camera work.I substituted higher impact moves since I do not have/use the gliding discs.  I believe you may get an even more intensive workout with the discs since I can see that you would really have to use your core on top of everything else but regular impact (jumping etc.) works also to give you a good workout.Overall, this was, perhaps, not quite as exciting to do as previous workouts but still went by quickly and, more importantly, is an effective workout.",4,Solid workout,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,694,"['consider', 'intermediate-advanced', 'level', 'fitness.Another', 'solid', 'workout', 'instructor', 'usual', 'non-annoying', 'backup', 'crew', 'decent', 'cues', 'non-intrusive', 'music', 'beat', 'high', 'production', 'quality', 'excellent', 'camera', 'work.I', 'substituted', 'higher', 'impact', 'moves', 'do', 'not', 'have/use', 'gliding', 'discs', 'believe', 'may', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'intensive', 'workout', 'discs', 'can', 'see', 'would', 'really', 'have', 'use', 'core', 'top', 'everything', 'else', 'regular', 'impact', 'jumping', 'etc', 'also', 'give', 'good', 'workout.Overall', 'was', 'perhaps', 'not', 'quite', 'exciting', 'do', 'previous', 'workouts', 'still', 'went', 'quickly', 'more', 'importantly', 'effective', 'workout']",N/A
1505285,A19XC6Z95GK5AB,B005XMC7WO,"Nancy Loderick ""Internet strategist""","[20, 22]","This is the toughest of Cathe's Low Impact Series.  It's awesome.  Once again, Miss Cathe has proven beyond the shadow of doubt that low impact can mean high intensity.  This workout consists of seven routines; you alternate a low impact cardio move with a compound move using light weights.  You do each two moves two times through.  Cardio endurance is the focus here.This workout combines HiiT(high intensity interval training), with metabolic weight training (high reps using light weights and short rest periods).Why I love this workout:**It's a killer and it's nonstop movement.  I feel so energized and accomplished after I've finished.  I'm not even close to using the same weights as Cathe.  Who would have thought that little 8 pound or 5 pound dumb bells could feel so heavy?**It works your core with planks, pushups, mountain climbers and burpees.  I have a love/hate relationship with these exercises.  I hate doing them, but I love how they tone my core.**The fun variety of exercises.  You'll do spidermans with the gliding discs, you'll do lunges with shoulder raises and you'll do air squats.  Even if you don't like a particular exercise, there's enough variety that you'll find some exercises that you like.**The music has a driving beat, which really helps get me through a tough workout like this.  I was pleasantly surprised since I usually don't like Cathe's taste in workout music.There are some things to note about this workout.  I don't consider them to be negatives since I so love this workout.The things to note:**The lunges could tweak your knees, while the pushups and planks could tweak your wrists.  Cathe doesn't really give any modifications for these exercises, so you're on your own.  You could lunge less deeply, or just do back lunges.  For the pushups etc., you could try to use dumb bells to support your wrists.**This is truly an advanced workout, with very few modifications given.  To make the workout easier, you could do it with no weights and also do it without using the gliding discs.If you are looking to breakthrough a plateau and want to mix up your workout routine with something fun, try this workout!",5,More like total burn!,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,2156,"['toughest', 'Cathe', 'Low', 'Impact', 'Series', 'awesome', 'Once', 'again', 'Miss', 'Cathe', 'proven', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'low', 'impact', 'can', 'mean', 'high', 'intensity', 'workout', 'seven', 'routines', 'alternate', 'low', 'impact', 'cardio', 'move', 'compound', 'move', 'using', 'light', 'weights', 'do', 'two', 'moves', 'two', 'times', 'Cardio', 'endurance', 'focus', 'here.This', 'workout', 'combines', 'HiiT', 'high', 'intensity', 'interval', 'training', 'metabolic', 'weight', 'training', 'high', 'reps', 'using', 'light', 'weights', 'short', 'rest', 'periods', '.Why', 'love', 'workout', '**It', 'killer', 'nonstop', 'movement', 'feel', 'so', 'energized', 'accomplished', ""'ve"", 'finished', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'close', 'using', 'same', 'weights', 'Cathe', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'little', '8', 'pound', '5', 'pound', 'dumb', 'bells', 'could', 'feel', 'so', 'heavy', '**It', 'core', 'planks', 'pushups', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'burpees', 'have', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'exercises', 'hate', 'doing', 'love', 'how', 'tone', 'core', 'fun', 'variety', 'exercises', ""'ll"", 'do', 'spidermans', 'gliding', 'discs', ""'ll"", 'do', 'lunges', 'shoulder', 'raises', ""'ll"", 'do', 'air', 'squats', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'particular', 'exercise', 'enough', 'variety', ""'ll"", 'find', 'exercises', 'like', '**The', 'music', 'driving', 'beat', 'really', 'get', 'tough', 'workout', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Cathe', 'taste', 'workout', 'are', 'things', 'note', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'negatives', 'so', 'love', 'workout.The', 'things', 'note', '**The', 'lunges', 'could', 'tweak', 'knees', 'pushups', 'planks', 'could', 'tweak', 'wrists', 'Cathe', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'modifications', 'exercises', ""'re"", 'own', 'could', 'lunge', 'less', 'deeply', 'just', 'do', 'back', 'pushups', 'etc.', 'could', 'try', 'use', 'dumb', 'bells', 'support', 'wrists', '**This', 'truly', 'advanced', 'workout', 'very', 'few', 'modifications', 'given', 'make', 'workout', 'easier', 'could', 'do', 'weights', 'also', 'do', 'using', 'gliding', 'discs.If', 'are', 'looking', 'breakthrough', 'plateau', 'want', 'mix', 'up', 'workout', 'routine', 'something', 'fun', 'try', 'workout']",N/A

My knees, however, started to go at this time in my life, so low-impact is a necessity. Cathe's Afterburn really does drive you and it is hard (and I had already been working out 5x a week for over a year when I got this video). It is all worth it, however, this works me and the sense of accomplishment I feel when I am done is well worth it. Cathe is encouraging and knowing that she is in her 50s (I think) makes me know I can do it too. You may not be able to do all of the exercises in the video or all of the reps, but do as much/many as you can until the day you can do it all. She does not offer modifications for most moves, which is a shame, but as long as you do what you can to the extent you can, and find a way to keep moving during the ones you can't do (be sure you don't do anything that hurts you) and then follow along with what you can, I think there is a benefit.
