235588,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,6300270025,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","There are some movies that, for reasons I don't quite understand, just flop at the box office.  This was one of them.  Tom Selleck, as some may know, was the original choice to play Indiana Jones, but couldn't do the film because of his commitment to the ""Magnum, P.I."" series in which he was starring at the time.  This move, which came along slightly later, was an attempt to get him into the role of rather Indiana Jones-like adventurer.  Unfortunately for poor Mr. Selleck, where ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was a huge blockbuster, ""High Road to China"" was a box office dud.It really is a shame, because the movie has a good story, a great cast, decent pacing, and real chemistry between the romantic leads, and an absolutely beautifil score by the great John Barry.  It's nowhere near the film ""Raiders"" was, but it should have done well.  I just don't know why people stayed away from the theaters for this one.The film is based on a decent novel that probably few have ever read, and departs quite dramatically from it in several respects.  The British William Bede O'Malley is changed to American Patrick O'Malley.  Tom Selleck, though he does well in the part, as an American is perhaps not quite the best actor to play an ex-WWI flying ace (there were relatively few U.S. aces, after all, given how late we entered the war), and at 6'4"" he's also rather big to be a fighter jock, especially from that era.  And it would be nice, for a change, to see a film made with American money where they don't feel compelled to change things in order to make the hero American.  The book had a German ex-enemy-turned-friend who is written completely out of the movie.  And the novel had the heroine's father a hostage taken by a Chinese warlord, not as a warlord himself.  But it's still an entertaining movie, and makes for a great afternoon or evening's entertainment.  The period and locations are mostly very well filmed, and it's a nice, old-fashioned, romantic adventure story.",4,A Cult Classic,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,1980,"['are', 'movies', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'just', 'flop', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'one', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'may', 'know', 'was', 'original', 'choice', 'play', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'commitment', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'series', 'was', 'starring', 'time', 'move', 'came', 'along', 'slightly', 'later', 'was', 'attempt', 'get', 'role', 'rather', 'Indiana', 'Jones-like', 'adventurer', 'Unfortunately', 'poor', 'Mr.', 'Selleck', 'where', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'was', 'huge', 'blockbuster', 'High', 'Road', 'China', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'dud.It', 'really', 'shame', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'decent', 'pacing', 'real', 'chemistry', 'romantic', 'leads', 'absolutely', 'beautifil', 'score', 'great', 'John', 'Barry', 'nowhere', 'film', 'Raiders', 'was', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'people', 'stayed', 'away', 'theaters', 'one.The', 'film', 'based', 'decent', 'novel', 'probably', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'quite', 'dramatically', 'several', 'respects', 'British', 'William', 'Bede', ""O'Malley"", 'changed', 'American', 'Patrick', ""O'Malley"", 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'well', 'part', 'American', 'perhaps', 'not', 'quite', 'best', 'actor', 'play', 'ex-WWI', 'flying', 'ace', 'were', 'relatively', 'few', 'U.S.', 'aces', 'given', 'how', 'late', 'entered', 'war', '6', '4', 'also', 'rather', 'big', 'be', 'fighter', 'jock', 'especially', 'era', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'change', 'see', 'film', 'made', 'American', 'money', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'compelled', 'change', 'things', 'order', 'make', 'hero', 'American', 'book', 'had', 'German', 'ex-enemy-turned-friend', 'who', 'written', 'completely', 'movie', 'novel', 'had', 'heroine', 'father', 'hostage', 'taken', 'Chinese', 'warlord', 'not', 'warlord', 'still', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'great', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'period', 'locations', 'are', 'mostly', 'very', 'well', 'filmed', 'nice', 'old-fashioned', 'romantic', 'adventure', 'story']",N/A

235595,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6300270025,Bobby Underwood,"[30, 30]","This wonderful film reminiscent of those 1930's comedy adventures had the misfortune to come on the heels of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was compared unfavorably to Raiders because critics were not astute enough to recognize the difference between a film paying homage to the serial adventures of the 1930's such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, and an affectionate wave to a bygone type of picture from the same era, no longer made.Critics may not have known what kind of film this was but Tom Selleck, as the often soused air ace Patrick O'Malley does, and so does Bess Armstong, who is quite wonderful in this film. She is spoiled heiress deluxe Evie Tozar, who hires Patrick to search for her missing father. The complication is that Bentik (Robert Morely) wants to insure she does not find him, so he can gain control of her father's fortune.The other complication is Patrick's drinking and her determination to find her father, even if it kills him! Watching Patrick and Evie argue and bicker all across Asia reminds us of Gable and Harlow, and the charm of those films from the 1930's where we knew the constantly bickering stars were going to fall in love.John Barry wrote his most beautiful score for this film, one that even outshines his later score for Out of Africa. It adds a sweeping beauty to the aerial scenes and the inevitable romance between the two leads. Bess Armstong shows something special here and should have become a big star. Perhaps the lukewarm reception to this magnificent film prevented that from happening.Wilfred Brimley as Evie's father, and Jack Weston as Struts offer fine support in secondary roles, but Selleck and Armstrong are the big stars here, and they fill the screen in a manner befitting those film legends of the 1930's. It would be difficult to find anyone who has seen this film who didn't love it. Make do with whatever copy of this one you can acquire for now. Surely someone will realize what an audience there is for this type of entertainment, and at some point it will become available once again.

It is like someone crossed Indiana Jones with an Aviator. In fact if you enjoyed Aviator with Christopher Reeve you will love this one. It takes place in the 1920's and the costumes, sets, and music are wonderfully done.When former WWI ace Patrick O'Malley, Tom Selleck, is hired to take a wealthy spoiled heiress Eve Tozer, Bess Armstrong, to her father, Wilford Bramley, the adventure and spatting begins. Eve finds out her father's fortune is in danger because his partner, Mr. Bentik, played by Robert Morley, is declaring her father dead since he has been absent for years, she sets out to find him.She finds that not only is there a very limited amount of time but her father's partner will stop at nothing to prevent her from reaching her father before the deadline. She talks O'Malley into taking her to Afghanistan. With the assistance of Struts, Jack Weston, O'Malley's mechanic there journey just begins in Afghanistan, after besting a Tribe leader there they must go to Nepal. No sooner there they find they now must go to a province in China.

However there is something about this simple film that keeps me coming back for more again and again. Spoilers after this point:  It's a simple story with a non ending where the catalyst for the entire plot amounts to basically nothing at the end. This is not a bad thing. Since it deviates from the norm with everything all wrapped up nicely this film sort of just fades out slowly with the main characters not even returning to home. Both planes destroyed, money undelivered, wealth never relay in jeopardy, and a battle that is not entirely over pretty much sums up the ending. Still the film leaves you satisfied. The bickering relationship between Tom Selleck and Bess Armstrong is the classic I hate you, but I really love you antagonistic fore play. Even though the relationship is never fully summed up I was left feeling like all was going to be well. The two were meant for one another and that was all that mattered. At it's core the film is a love story that takes place on cool bi-wing airplanes with some side story action.  The soundtrack is also worth mentioning. John Barry who of course did the early amazing Bond scores and the also amazing Dances With Wolves score.

I then bought a European DVD that apparently was made from the VHS as the video was equal to or less quality.

I absolutely love this flic and my granddaughters think the Bess Armstrong character is a whole lot like Grandma as far as being feisty (ha ha). The flying scenes are great. The characters have depth, and the story line is a great vehicle for the action.For those who haven't seen it, it is a redemption story. A WW I flying ace is now a broken down alcoholic rent-a-plane driver. The girl is a spoiled rich kid too well known by most of the British officer corp. Word comes to her that her over-the-horizon father is about to be declared dead by his deadbeat partner who will then take all the company assets, leaving our little rich girl out on the street. She, a skilled pilot herself, hires our hero and his mechanic to fly her to find her father eventually winding up in China where daddy is helping the locals fight off a warlord. Along the way they have a load of close escapes and other adventures flying across India to China. The deadbeat partner keeps trying to assassinate the girl and her fellow travellers. There's even an air combat sequence where our hero shows his stuff (he really is a combat ace several times over). I'll leave the ending out, but it does end on a happy note as expected.

Indeed, the Blu-ray version is superior to pretty much every DVD out there today.So, why are reviewers dissing the Blu-ray transfer. The answer is deceptively simple and in two parts:Firstly, in the few short years since Blu-ray debuted the format has set the bar so high in terms of high definition content that anything short of that is seen as a disappointment. The Blu-ray of ""High Road to China"", which easily bests the DVD, is still not of a level to where it stands up to other releases in the format.Secondly, the movie itself. The film stock most commonly used in the late 1970s and early 1980s is well known, indeed famous, for its very softness. So, in retaining the actual look of the film the movie falls short of the detail that people have become accustomed to in terms of Blu-ray. Sure, Hen's Tooth could have taken the easy route and DNR'd ""High Road to China"" to death, but is that what we actually would want?  I've taken some of the frames of ""High Road to China"" and applied DNR and it just does not look right. Why? because the movie was never meant to be that detailed or sharp.So, be confident in purchasing ""High Road to China"" on Blu-ray. It does offer a significant upgrade on the DVD. It is better quality than DVD in general. The Blu-ray is the best the movie has looked since its theatrical run in 1983. However, don't expect to ever use it as a reference quality Blu-ray or that it will stack up to the quality of ""Iron Man"" or ""Avatar"".

They must find him before his evil partner Bentik, delightfully played by Robert Morley, declares him dead and takes over the company.  Aerial cinematography, John Barry's wonderful score and delightful acting chemistry make for great film watching.  Rounding out the cast is Jack Weston as O'Malley's partner Struts and Brian Blessed as Suleman Khan.I don't think anyone is surprised that Selleck was the first choice for Indiana Jones and this movie easily shows his ability to have handled that role.  It is easy to compare the two and maybe this is the wrong thing to do as each movie carries its' own strengths and weaknesses.  This movie might arguably never have been made if not for Raiders.

Along comes this romantic comedy-adventure flick, scored beautifully by John Barry, with great cinematography and terrific performances by Tom Selleck (at his peak) and Bess Armstrong, and supported by the funniest Jack Weston, and what a delightful movie to watch. Obviously obscured by the Indiana Jones flicks, it comes off theatres, and finds its way to VHS, but never to DVD in the U.S. Don't bother with the European DVD imports, they are just transfers from the horrible VHS which was framed at 4x3 aspect ratio. The theatrical presentation was 1.85:1. I am hoping the Blu-ray preserves the original ratio. I can't wait to see it like I did almost 30 years ago.An UPDATE to this review on 4-22-12: Since Amazon placed me on backorder with the Blu-ray temporarily out of stock, I ordered it from a marketplace seller who had it in stock, and I received it in 3 days. I was a little scared by the reviews I had read about the quality of the blu-ray, but I was not that dissapointed, to be quite honest. Having projected this movie several times on film ( I was a part-time projectionist while in college), the image quality of the Blu-ray is identical to the motion picture print. The movie never had very saturated colors, but they were very natural looking. Also, some scenes were apparently shot with a diffusion filter, making them look sightly foggy. Remember this is a 30 year old negative, and probably not heavily digitally restored. However the transfer to video is extremely clean with no scratches or dust marks at all. I actually was more dissapointed with the soundtrack. It was a 2-track DTS but had no surround encoding. I could not get my receiver to enhance it with any of the surround settings, and I was not able to get any sound from the rear channels at all!.I want to thank Hens Tooth Video for making this great film available to us, and for doing a terrific job with the source they were given by the film's rights' proprietors.

It took a little while for Amazon to send it to me but even after reading the negative reviews, it was worth the wait. Sure, the presentation on blu-ray could have been better but it probably would have raised the price.  It is certainly better than my worn out video cassette.  Here's a good way to enjoy this movie: Lower your color and tint settings (to get most of the red out of Tom's face) and lower the brightness some (so that the daylight scenes look normal).  Then, on an HDTV using HDMI cable, you may surprised how watchable the movie is. Regardless of the sound recording (which seemed fine to me), John Barry's hauntingly beautiful theme alone is worth the price of admission.  His orchestral themes seemed perfectly suited to this action/adventure setting.  This is probably the best version of this movie we will ever see.  Amazon's price is perfect (and was the only way to get the movie around Peoria, Illinois).  It's simple, if you have seen the movie, then buy this blu-ray.

Unfortunately, HIGH ROAD TO CHINA was released in the long shadow of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and has always been considered derivative, fogging the fact that this film is an example of quality entertainment all on its own.In HIGH ROAD TO CHINA, set in the early 1920s, Armstrong plays Eve Tozer, the spoiled flapper daughter of a China trader who has gone missing in that vast land. Tozer leaves Paris, where she has been gorging at the moveable feast, and sets out east to find her father. She hires Selleck, a swashbuckling World War I ace, to fly her into the heart of the Orient.Along the way, the byplay between them is acidic and wildly funny. Armstrong is cute, sharp and sassy (and looks great in flying breeches); Selleck plays it as the intelligent lummox, the perfect foil for her cutting wit.If the ending is a bit over-the-top, it is no more over-the-top than anything RAIDERS and its sequels presented, albeit not as deftly handled. Still, HIGH ROAD TO CHINA is a sleeper that should not be missed.Why this film (theatrically released in 1983) had to wait until 2000 for an already outdated VHS release and still hasn't been transferred to DVD is an open question. One prior reviewer claims that Selleck's conservative politics are to blame; be that as it may, had HIGH ROAD TO CHINA been the moneymaking mega-hit it should have been, Selleck's NRA membership would not have mattered.

235676,A129YBX5BVNW2,6300270025,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[2, 2]","Before there was George Clooney - there was Tom Selleck - as personable an actor as you could get. Women loved him and guys admired him.And I can remember seeing &#34;High Road To China&#34; at the cinema on release in 1983 and the audience warming wholeheartedly to its old-fashioned story of daring-do - a ripping yarn set in the 1920's with a handsome/rugged male lead (Tom Selleck) and a ballsy/brainy moll in distress (the lovely Bess Armstrong). All that and a score from John Barry that made the flying sequences feel lush and huge. I vividly recall Brian Hutton's movie being great 'fun' - a sort of poor man's Raiders/Indiana Jones and re-watching it on BLU RAY only confirms that. And remarkably it hasn't really aged a jot either...Miss Eve Tozer is a pretty society brat (Bess Armstrong) - the headstrong daughter of Bradley Tozer (Wilford Brimley). She spends money like water and her evenings doing the Charleston in the men's clubs with adoring officers waiting to light her cigarette. But then her faithful manservant Charlie Shane advises her that Mister Bentik (Robert Morley) - the partner in her absent fathers company - will be able to get all the assets (and therefore all the money) if he can legally declare her Dad dead in 12 days. But her father is in Afghanistan and Eve will need a plane to get there...possibly even a reliable hand at the throttle...Enter war-hero and ace fighter pilot Patrick O'Malley who just so happens to own two biplanes (Lorraine and Dorothy) and is both drunk and broke. O'Malley not only needs the hair of the dog to wake him up - but money to keep him and his trusty mechanic Struts (Jack Weston) in the liquid lunches they've become accustomed to. So after much haggling and brat refusal - Eve hires them for $60,000 - and off the motley crew set for Fort Kipling inside Afghanistan to seek her father.Along the way - they almost get Eve sold into slavery to a Sheik who keeps telling women to shut-up (a very funny Brian Blessed) - pick up a sultry lady passenger who helps them escape a war on the British (the gorgeous Cassandra Gava as Alessa) while the headstrong duo of Eve and O'Malley continue to have shouting matches on the ground and in the air everywhere they go. Until the gang has to finally fly into Xinjiang in China where they find her Dad setting explosives in a small but worthy battle (he&#8217;s become a General to lowly Chinese peasants defending their hillside town against a merciless warlord)...The will-they won't-they fighting between Selleck and the pint-sized Armstrong is done well (title above) - and not only do they have chemistry on screen - there's a very genuine likeability about both of them. Jack Weston, Brian Blessed, Robert Morley and Wilford Brimley (as Eve's father) provide a lot of the laughs in-between the set pieces. And there's convincing battle sequences, aerial photography and battle-of-the-sexes jokes galore. Great fun really...The BLU RAY picture quality is a very mixed bag - from gorgeous to awful and back again almost all of the time. It's defaulted to Full Aspect so it fills the entire scene (no lines top or bottom) and overall - I'd still have to say that it looks great despite its age. There's a slight haze on many scenes to give it that oldie look - and when it gets to the Robert Morley sequences back in his English Mansion as Bentik - the grain and fuzz swells are many (even if the humour is great). But then you're hit with a shot beside the two planes in a field where it looks absolutely gorgeous. Even in the tents at night when Eve is being sold as a slave to Suleman Khan (Brian Blessed) - the picture is very, very clean. But when they finally do get to China - there's a scene where Eve looks over at a sleeping O'Malley - it's awful one moment - uber clean the next - back to middling&#8230; The picture quality flits all over the place. But again - and I must stress this &#8211; &#8216;overall&#8217; it's a very a worthy upgrade if you love the film. It's just that with a bit of a clean up &#8211; a bit of digital TLC - it could have been fabulous.I found the audio to be most disappointing of all - it's rubbish frankly. Right from the clean opening credits - the soundtrack feels like its been tagged on - or recorded in a very small bucket. There's no real oomph of any kind - which is a shame because John Barry's work here is typically beautiful and panoramic too. English is the lone subtitle and there are no extras - slim pickings I'm afraid.Is &#34;High Road To China&#34; worth buying on BLU RAY - overall - I'd still say yes. It's unlikely that we'll see the film look any better.Sure it's a shame they didn't get the Lewis Guns out for a full-on restoration - but it's still a cracker of a movie and worth taking a punt on...",4,"""&#8230;You Dirty Rotten Rat!"" &#8211;

A labeled and sealed stamp?Instead, all they do, is to produce remakes, sequels and again remakes of remakes of even more remakes...Any normal child would say they are nuts, but not so at the upper echelons of the hierarchy, where they live excellent and comfortable lives and do not seem to realize that there is a very real world out there waiting for them to change their minds about some policies.But as long as incompetent lawyers and lazy (read greedy and corrupt) bankers rule over the New Hollywood System, nothing will ever budge nor change.We need risk-takers, gamblers (in the good sense of the word), and TRUE movie-makers as well as writers worth of this name. But above all, we need more pro-active distributors who actually have some cinematographic culture and a sense of history.This is after all an Art form, not just an industry, as many in Hollywood very conveniently have decided to consider.They have forgotten that an industry only works well when people are truly satisfied and not just a selected group of them, but rather the vastest cohortof them all.It is not enough to evaluate what a brand new movie makes in, say, two, three or four weeks at the box-office. It is also important to see if that very same movie will work in the future and other future generations to come.Alas though, we are living in an ""IN THE NOW"" society, where everyone is far too concerned about hers or his own welfare, rather than being concerned about the welfare of others.Self-glamorizing stars, self-servicing directors, and totally repetitive writers (many of whom have shamelessly plagiarized for years works by other more prominent, and probably far more talented peers) seem to rule the game these days.But how long will this new ""empire"" last?A castle needs strong walls.How strong are theirs?I hope that in the future, classics like ""HIGH ROAD TO CHINA"" (even if just a modern classic and only in the adventure genre), will all finally receive the well-deserved treatment they merit, since what many movie moguls tend to forget, they did not make themselves into what they are these days (I mean these movies).They were made by dozens if not hundreds of people who worked hard on them and for them, sometimes sacrificing much and even neglecting their own private lives.Granted. No one forced them into it, nor did anyone say they had to do it. But they did, and having given us a part of their lives with these works, they deserve to be more appreciated and respected than they are today.I hope my appeal will arrive to some ears and move things along, because in my own personal view, time has come to show some real respect for the culture of movie-making and its history.Consider bringing in people with a true vision and a true passion, as well as genuinely talented ones.It certainly would bring a refreshing regeneration of this industry.Forget about special effects, forget about monumental technical devices. Think about true stories and true actors (possibly some with a clear English pronunciation - sadly a rarity these days)...",5,"OK, it was Golden Harvest producing it, but...",1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,3703,"['why', 'heck', 'did', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'think', 'buying', 'rights', 'digitally', 'restore', 'convey', 'original', 'screen', 'ratio', 'format', 'One', 'mysteries', 'universe', 'Production', 'companies', 'days', 'seem', 'too', 'lazy', 'risk-shy', 'deliver', 'what', 'audiences', 'especially', 'certain', 'age', 'who', 'have', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'memories', 'have', 'been', 'demanding', 'ages.Bring', 'oldies', 'goodies', 'light', 'What', 'get', 'days', 'are', 'very', 'timid', 'attempts', 'may', 'say', 'shamelessly', 'costly', 'bring', 'back', 'movie', 'titles', 'have', 'proven', 'quality', 'have', 'provenso', 'showing.What', 'more', 'do', 'Studios', '/', 'Production', 'Companies', 'want', 'more', 'labeled', 'sealed', 'stamp', 'Instead', 'do', 'produce', 'remakes', 'sequels', 'again', 'remakes', 'remakes', 'even', 'more', 'remakes', 'Any', 'normal', 'child', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'nuts', 'not', 'so', 'upper', 'echelons', 'hierarchy', 'where', 'live', 'excellent', 'comfortable', 'lives', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'realize', 'very', 'real', 'world', 'there', 'waiting', 'change', 'minds', 'policies.But', 'as', 'long', 'incompetent', 'lawyers', 'lazy', 'read', 'greedy', 'corrupt', 'bankers', 'rule', 'New', 'Hollywood', 'System', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'budge', 'change.We', 'need', 'risk-takers', 'gamblers', 'good', 'sense', 'word', 'TRUE', 'movie-makers', 'as', 'well', 'writers', 'name', 'all', 'need', 'more', 'pro-active', 'distributors', 'who', 'actually', 'have', 'cinematographic', 'culture', 'sense', 'history.This', 'Art', 'form', 'not', 'just', 'industry', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'very', 'conveniently', 'have', 'decided', 'consider.They', 'have', 'forgotten', 'industry', 'only', 'well', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'truly', 'satisfied', 'not', 'just', 'selected', 'group', 'rather', 'vastest', 'cohortof', 'all.It', 'not', 'enough', 'evaluate', 'what', 'brand', 'new', 'movie', 'say', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'weeks', 'box-office', 'also', 'important', 'see', 'very', 'same', 'movie', 'will', 'work', 'future', 'other', 'future', 'generations', 'come.Alas', 'are', 'living', 'IN', 'NOW', 'society', 'where', 'everyone', 'far', 'too', 'concerned', 'hers', 'own', 'welfare', 'rather', 'being', 'concerned', 'welfare', 'others.Self-glamorizing', 'stars', 'self-servicing', 'directors', 'totally', 'repetitive', 'writers', 'many', 'whom', 'have', 'shamelessly', 'plagiarized', 'years', 'works', 'other', 'more', 'prominent', 'probably', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'peers', 'seem', 'rule', 'game', 'days.But', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'new', 'empire', 'last', 'castle', 'strong', 'walls.How', 'strong', 'are', 'theirs', 'hope', 'future', 'classics', 'HIGH', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'CHINA', 'even', 'just', 'modern', 'classic', 'only', 'adventure', 'genre', 'will', 'finally', 'receive', 'well-deserved', 'treatment', 'merit', 'what', 'many', 'movie', 'moguls', 'tend', 'forget', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'what', 'are', 'days', 'mean', 'movies', '.They', 'were', 'made', 'dozens', 'not', 'hundreds', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'sacrificing', 'much', 'even', 'neglecting', 'own', 'private', 'lives.Granted', 'one', 'forced', 'did', 'anyone', 'say', 'had', 'do', 'did', 'having', 'given', 'part', 'lives', 'works', 'deserve', 'be', 'more', 'appreciated', 'respected', 'are', 'today.I', 'hope', 'appeal', 'will', 'arrive', 'ears', 'move', 'things', 'along', 'own', 'personal', 'view', 'time', 'come', 'show', 'real', 'respect', 'culture', 'movie-making', 'history.Consider', 'bringing', 'people', 'true', 'vision', 'true', 'passion', 'as', 'well', 'genuinely', 'talented', 'ones.It', 'certainly', 'would', 'bring', 'refreshing', 'regeneration', 'industry.Forget', 'special', 'effects', 'forget', 'monumental', 'technical', 'devices', 'Think', 'true', 'stories', 'true', 'actors', 'possibly', 'clear', 'English', 'pronunciation', 'sadly', 'rarity', 'days']",N/A

Admittedly this is an Indiana Jones knock off, but not a bad one.  Some of the shots and cuts are a little on the basic side.  It doesn't have the cinematic complexity of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", nor some heavy underlying themes regarding good and evil and lost civilizations.But it does have some dynamic characters who0 are a pleasure to watch.  The scope of the production is sweeping, but the camera is a little shy to show us all of the splendor that is outlaid before us.  We don't get too many panoramic shots of army encampments, but we do see them.  We don't get incredible long shots of armies storming positions, but, again, we do see them.  In this regard the film itself is basic and delivers on its promise to show Tom Selleck and Bess Armstrong in an adventure that takes them to the ends of the Earth.It's a loving film that, again, rides the market trend of the adventure genre revitalized by Spielberg and Lucas with Raiders, but offers the audience more of a couples film than a testosterone driven adventure against the forces of darkness.  This film takes place perhaps a decade or so before Indy's adventures, but still carries the same flavor in terms of being a period piece in exotic locations.I've got minor quibbles with some of the supporting cast, the dogfight, and maybe one or two process shots, but, even then this is a production in the classic Hollywood vein of offering a romantic fantasy, because that's kind of what we're interested in; the aviatrix and her has-been war hero who's down and out.Henstooth Video had the luck of getting the rights for this great film, and have given an almost forgotten piece of cinema a proper relaunch and new life.

Sounds like new Blu-ray isn't worth owning due to very poor quality; maybe regular disk is???  At least it costs less, and I'd recently seen price new down about $2 already from $19.99 at Amazon.We love this movie and have watched it over and over a couple of times each year since we recorded copy from TV.  However it doesn't have captions, which my wife now needs to enjoy it.  So we've eagerly awaited the new release on DVD and Blu-ray with subtitles, but disappointed about quality ratings we've seen.  We put our Amazon order on hold, and are still holding.  I prefer Blu-ray, but don't consider it worth that much more (to us at least) than regular DVD.  We opt for it when price difference is reasonable, like $0.30 each more at RedBox, few $/mo more on Netflix.At my request, our local library purchased a copy of recent regular DVD with subtitles.  We've now watched it several times as a loaner from them, thus have avoided buying copy at high prices out there so far.

Patrick O'Malley, played by Tom Selleck is a former world war 1 fighter pilot and now ace flying instructor.  He is a womanizer and is fond of getting drunk every night at the Blue Nile club.  But he meets his match with society dame, Eve Tosser, played by Bess Armstrong.  She needs O'Malley to help her find her father before the courts declare him dead and she loses her inheritance.  He has disappeared somewhere in Wazuristan and she is willing to pay handsomely for O'Malley's aircrafts.  Eve is also an ace flier.  During their adventures they are hounded by the evil Bentick (Robert Morley), the nasty Tribal leader, Suli Mon Kahn (Brian Blessed), various thugs, and a German flier, named major Hess who all try to destroy the trio before Eve can reach her father.Despite the serious nature of the film, there are many scenes that are laughable and comical. Jack Weston plays a fine supporting role as Struts, O'Malley's rotund mechanic.The film takes place in Egypt, Tibet, and finally ends in China.  The scenery is breathtaking and beautiful.I really enjoyed watching the DVD edition of this film on my large TV which was much better than watching the VHS tape on my little TV.It's a wonderfully entertaining film.

I've lost count how many times I've watched this excellent little movie. There is such a chemistry between the two lead characters that the film is a real joy. I don't think Bess Armstrong played such a likeable funny magnetic character again. (Then again I don't suppose I've seen all her work. Suffice to say , she is wonderful in this).And Tom Selleck demonstrates most clearly how underrated he has been since the days of ""Magnum"". High Road to China was a bit lost at it's time of release. It was dismissed as a Raiders of the Lost Arc wanna-be. Looking at it again now makes one realise that this was a silly and shallow comparison to make. The only similarity is the time period the film takes place in.Now to the negative. A DVD release of this film is LONG overdue. Why oh why is it being flopped into the market place with poor mono sound and dodgy unrestored picture that looks like it has been pirated from a VHS tape?I bought this DVD from another source in Australia and was just so glad to finally have it on DVD in any condition. However I do fear that the uncreative twits who make the decisions as to which movies are to be released on DVD, are simply testing the waters with this unrestored release. If this sells well then maybe High Road to China will eventually be given the treatment it deserves and fully restored and re-released on DVD.These decision makers aren't fans of movies. They don't understand why or how a film is a success. (just look at the number of sequels that are made, when the first in any series always has to struggle to be approved).This DVD release is well worth getting in my opinion because the characters and story hold one's attention so well that the dodgy quality of the DVD itself is not too distracting an issue.

I just saw most of the movie this afternoon on TV - complete with popcorn! I have loved High Road to China for over 20 years!The romantic score by John Barry is as beautiful as any soundtrack could ever be! The flying scenes in the wonderful old planes, WWI planes, are beautiful. Camels? The love scene at the end is one of my all-time favorite love scenes in any movie. Years ago I wore out an old cassette rewinding it just to see that scene over and over and over again. It is NOT a chick-flick because it has too much action (some rotten language, too) but Selleck steals your heart away. Simple as that.I find that now, at nearly 75, Tom Selleck still does ""it"" for me. Smile.. . . they have said their goodbyes. She has walked away - he is thinking - you can read his thoughts - and John Barry's beautiful music begins - suddenly he stands - he calls out to her, ""Hey!"" She turns around - looks at him. ""Come here a minute."" She turns, walks slowly toward him. ""Closer,"" he says. She walks even more slowly until . . . she is finally very, very close. He waits, then says, ""Now - put your arms around me."" She slowly slips both arms around his neck. He looks down at her - just the way all women want to be looked at - and he says, ""You know, I only made one real mistake."" Looking up at him - eyes smiling, she asks, ""What was that?"" Selleck: ""I should have sold you when I had the chance."" Her arms stretch up and her hands gently pull his face down to hers. He wraps his arms around her . . . the kiss - the music - the biplane gliding in the sky - the music . . . beautiful . . .",5,TAKING the HIGH ROAD with TOM SELLECK,1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,1721,"['High', 'Road', 'China', '1983', 'movie', 'humble', 'opinion', 'best', 'film', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'ever', 'made', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'also', 'wonderful', 'just', 'saw', 'most', 'movie', 'afternoon', 'TV', 'complete', 'popcorn', 'have', 'loved', 'High', 'Road', 'China', '20', 'years', 'romantic', 'score', 'John', 'Barry', 'as', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'flying', 'scenes', 'wonderful', 'old', 'planes', 'WWI', 'planes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Camels', 'love', 'scene', 'end', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'love', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Years', 'wore', 'out', 'old', 'cassette', 'rewinding', 'just', 'see', 'scene', 'over', 'again', 'NOT', 'chick-flick', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'rotten', 'language', 'too', 'Selleck', 'steals', 'heart', 'away', 'Simple', 'that.I', 'find', 'now', 'nearly', '75', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'still', 'Smile..', 'have', 'said', 'goodbyes', 'walked', 'away', 'thinking', 'can', 'read', 'thoughts', 'John', 'Barry', 'beautiful', 'music', 'suddenly', 'out', 'Hey', 'around', 'Come', 'here', 'minute', 'walks', 'slowly', 'Closer', 'walks', 'even', 'more', 'slowly', 'finally', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'then', 'Now', 'put', 'arms', 'slowly', 'slips', 'arms', 'neck', 'down', 'just', 'way', 'women', 'want', 'be', 'looked', 'know', 'only', 'made', 'one', 'real', 'mistake', 'Looking', 'up', 'eyes', 'smiling', 'What', 'was', 'Selleck', 'should', 'have', 'sold', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'arms', 'stretch', 'up', 'hands', 'gently', 'face', 'down', 'hers', 'arms', 'kiss', 'music', 'biplane', 'gliding', 'sky', 'music', 'beautiful']",N/A
