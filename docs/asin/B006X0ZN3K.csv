Time..it tells us who made worthwhile films which tells us something about our time, or the human being, and strikes a chord, and Stanwyck was this actress...she started in the 1930's but ran out of steam in the mid 50's largely for unexplained reasons. Her box office wasnt bad, parts just dried up. Here we have a good american film genre, the film noir, and no better actress and very few could pull it off, here she is venomous and romantic, on the edge and manipulative,...the film opens with a child..some crime either mom or dad will be sent away for...she's out of the house..on a train...to nowhere...a long shot of her looking at feet..here we have the director visually impinging ideas on our understanding of the film, which is typical in film noir, and the time when scripts were not allowed to delve into some subject matters, even as late as the SEven Year Itch. In a talk a gentleman with a lady present talks of a family man...compared to the wife. A shot at Stanwyck..horrific train crash..excellent visual!! Hospitalization..identity issues..blackouts..hysteria/trauma...a series of lovers..christmas scene with message she's being chased. By whom? Who else could act the terror of her soul like Stanwyck, the helplessness...she's onthe run..her new lover husband is coming over and wont leave town without the loot...a man is shot but she was not the killer and she thought she was..but another fellow so the detective says? Surely a case of semantics since she put a bullet through a dead man's body..and dead men tale no tales...but she must make statement signed and sealed with D>A> in morning..and film's over...thanks to Olive films for bringing one of the few Stanywyck films not available to the dvd market...what other actress contemporaneous with her or even today could fill her shoes,...warner's has recently put out one of her last films with James Cagney Those wilder Years about a father going through  courts to find son...ill try to get a copy and review.",4,greatly admired film finally on dvd,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,2121,"['Stanwyck', 'films', 'are', 'abundantly', 'available', 'dvd', 'almost', 'neglect', 'very', 'famous', 'personalities', 'film', 'people', 'past', 'Time..it', 'who', 'made', 'worthwhile', 'films', 'tells', 'something', 'time', 'human', 'being', 'chord', 'Stanwyck', 'was', 'actress', 'started', '1930', 'ran', 'steam', 'mid', '50', 'largely', 'unexplained', 'reasons', 'box', 'office', 'wasnt', 'bad', 'parts', 'just', 'dried', 'up', 'Here', 'have', 'good', 'american', 'film', 'genre', 'film', 'noir', 'better', 'actress', 'very', 'few', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'here', 'venomous', 'romantic', 'edge', 'manipulative', 'film', 'child..some', 'crime', 'mom', 'dad', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'away', 'house..on', 'train', 'nowhere', 'long', 'shot', 'looking', 'feet..here', 'have', 'director', 'visually', 'impinging', 'ideas', 'understanding', 'film', 'typical', 'film', 'noir', 'time', 'when', 'scripts', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'delve', 'subject', 'matters', 'even', 'as', 'late', 'SEven', 'Year', 'Itch', 'talk', 'gentleman', 'lady', 'present', 'talks', 'family', 'man', 'compared', 'wife', 'shot', 'Stanwyck..horrific', 'train', 'crash..excellent', 'visual', 'Hospitalization..identity', 'issues..blackouts..hysteria/trauma', 'series', 'lovers..christmas', 'scene', 'message', 'being', 'chased', 'whom', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'act', 'terror', 'soul', 'Stanwyck', 'helplessness', 'onthe', 'run..her', 'new', 'lover', 'husband', 'coming', 'wont', 'leave', 'town', 'loot', 'man', 'shot', 'was', 'not', 'killer', 'thought', 'fellow', 'so', 'detective', 'Surely', 'case', 'semantics', 'put', 'bullet', 'dead', 'man', 'body..and', 'dead', 'men', 'tale', 'tales', 'must', 'make', 'statement', 'signed', 'sealed', 'D', '>', 'A', '>', 'morning..and', 'film', 'thanks', 'Olive', 'films', 'bringing', 'one', 'few', 'Stanywyck', 'films', 'not', 'available', 'dvd', 'market', 'what', 'other', 'actress', 'contemporaneous', 'even', 'today', 'could', 'fill', 'shoes', 'warner', 'recently', 'put', 'out', 'one', 'last', 'films', 'James', 'Cagney', 'wilder', 'Years', 'father', 'going', 'courts', 'find', 'son', 'ill', 'try', 'get', 'copy', 'review']",No Man of Her Own

I won't go into specifics on the story because that has been done by previous reviewers.  What I will say is that the DVD transfer is excellent....both sight and sound.  Stanwyck was positively the greatest actress of her generation and possibly the greatest actress of all time.  So honest, sincere and talented.  This film shows her at the peak of her craft....a true artist.  The story is engaging and keeps you in suspense from the first moment to the last.  Not one wasted reel.  Directed by Mitchell Leisen, it is film noir at its best.  The interesting thing about this film is that Stanwyck did all her stunts in the train wreck scene, along with Phyllis Thaxter.  Jane Cowl is deliciously sympathetic as the grandmother.  Lyle Bettger is a true menace and John Lund, though bland, is made to look good by Stanwyck.

1522478,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,B006X0ZN3K,C. Rothlind,"[2, 2]","Engrossing sort-of-noir about a woman assuming a mistaken identity by dumb luck. Stanwyck is excellent as usual, bringing the moral authority of the Mother she infused every role with. She could plead like no one else. That voice helped--along with Joan Greenwood's, Lizabeth Scott's, Lauren Bacall's and Kathleen Turner's one of the most distinctive in film history. One of the boys yet 100% woman, the strength of her genuine weakness is irresistible and on full display here.This was Lyle Bettger's first role and he is both menacing and alluring, with leading-man good-looks and charisma to spare. This may be the only role in which he ever combined those characteristics, which is sad because he had all the goods. Lund, by comparison, is a complete bore.I was pleasantly surprised by this film, though I needn't have been given that Mitchell Leisen directed. My one quibble was with the lengths to which the script goes to establish the innocent-victim status of Stanwyck's character. Rather heavy-handed and unnecessary, given the moral bonus points Stanwyck goes into any role with. She's good even when she's bad. Still, it would be hard to imagine the ending without our willing complicity in her good-fortune.

It was intense but I really hated Barbara Stanwycks character for this where she pleads with all the men in her life ""Ill give you anything""Her character was spineless to meThe story is a *stolen identity* plot where Barabara Stanwyck in the role of Helen Ferguson takes on the identity of Patrice Harkness, who is part of a wealthy family when the real Mrs Harkness (& husband) are killed in a train crash. She takes the identity and tries to live with this rich family despite feeling guilty. Add a really sick ex-boyfriend of Helens to the mix in a blackmail scheme and you've got something that to me sounded interesting. What did Helen see in her ex anyway, and the role she played while he was blackmailing her to me made women look really bad the way she begged and pleaded. I couldnt wait until the end.So it was a frusterating movie for me to watch and yes it does sound good. Most might enjoy this kind of movie and I usually do, but sometimes a character just blows it for me.The DVD from Olive - the print is average, nothing special, Im sure they did what they could. The source material may just be really in bad shape.This is the kind of movie that I should have rented first but it sounded like it cant miss and it did.

1522490,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B006X0ZN3K,Muzzlehatch,"[7, 7]","It takes a great cast, director, crew and screenplay to turn a hoary story idea like this: a woman impersonating another (dead) woman, becoming part of the dead woman's family, and then getting visited by her dark and shady past - and turn it into something close to a masterpiece. Fortunately, director and uncredited contributor to the screenplay Mitchell Leisen, screenwriters Sally Benson and Catherine Turney (adapting a Cornell Woolrich novel), and principal cast Barbara Stanwyck, John Lund, Phyllis Thaxter, Jane Cowl and Lyle Bettger are around to perform the miracle, and make this into a seminal woman-in-danger noir.As the film begins, the pregnant Stanwyck character is thrown over by scumbag boyfriend Bettger, and given a trainride out of town. On the train she meets a sympathetic couple, also about to have a child, and the woman lets her try on her wedding ring while they are in the ladies' room. You know what's going to happen now don't you? Well, if you can't guess I won't spoil it. In any case, Stanwyck is soon mistakenly adopted into a new family with her new baby, but it's a rich family, and somehow slimy Bettger finds out... Stanwyck is just marvellous in a role that calls for a lot of bewilderment and uncertainty, and only a gradual show of the kind of strength that the actress demonstrated time and again; Lund is excellent as the sympathetic brother-in-law who wants to be more, and Bettger, wow, what a great creep.  There's a bit of great location work at a train station which combines strikingly well with the Paramount sets used for the rest of it, and a lovely Olde New England stuffiness is beautifully communicated to contrast with the more modern and ""liberated"" Stanwyck character.The Olive DVD is pretty solid looking except for a bad patch about ten minutes before the end that's a bit grainy and hissy; no extras at all, not even a trailer.  So not the greatest noir or Stanwyck release ever in terms of disc quality, but is there likely to be any kind of upgrade?

She plays Helen, a pregnant young woman fleeing her worthless lover (Lyle Bettger). On the train out of town, she meets Patrice Harkness (Phyllis Thaxter), a bride of her age and general description, who's on her way with her groom to meet her rich in-laws for the first time. When the train crashes and the newlyweds are both killed, the desperate Helen sees a chance at a new life for herself and her unborn child. So Helen becomes Patrice, and she's accepted by the dead woman's in-laws and taken into their home. Her new ""family"" is kind to her, and the dead groom's brother (John Lund) even falls for her. Everything's like a dream come true--until the creepy ex-boyfriend shows up with blackmail on his mind...NO MAN OF HER OWN is based on the novelI Married a Dead Man (The Best Mysteries of All Time)by Cornell Woolrich, and it's one of several great films based on his wonderful stories.
