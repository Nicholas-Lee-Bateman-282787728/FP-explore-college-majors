It was made on little money, and a great Kickstarter campaign. It is mostly a box film with the house being the main set. It has a small cast and the suggestion of special effects. What it has in surplus is a great story and amazing characters.Mike Flanagan has a wonderful cast. From the first scene you get pure sympathetic performances from Courtney Bell & Katie Parker. As the cast expands you get Dave Levine's great cop only matched by Justin Gordon. At no point was I not believing a character.One beautiful element to this script is the dialogue. It is true. It is quick and isn't bogged down by long orations. It is people speaking as people speak. That is a rare gift for any screenwriter.Next this film is scary. The first act alone had me jumping at more points than I'd like to admit. At the third act I knew what was coming and still jumped.Flanagan needs to do more films now. Absentia the disc is filled with great extras. The retrospective is insightful to the entire film.I'm a huge fan of ELB (Extremely Low Budget) films. They force the cast & crew to work at a level bigger budgets can cast aside. Absentia will stay with me for days.

1519215,A3KZLNCUDDY7J,B006QWC2ZC,Amanda,"[3, 5]","I've seen a lot of horror movies (pretty much every one offered on Amazon, campy 80's horror movies excluded) and was in the mood for something genuinely creepy and scary to watch this morning. Not an easy task for someone that's seen it all. After watching the trailer for this movie on Youtube it definitely seemed worth a shot. And I was really pleasantly surprised. I have only ever written one other review but I felt like this one was worth the time. Although somewhat low-budget in production value, the quality was still perfectly good enough (no sound, lighting issues etc.) And even though few movies have succeeded in truly creeping me out, this one certainly did. The haunting and graphic images were at time really horrifying and even though they built the tension to the ""big scares"", thus giving away what was about to happen, I still found myself jumping in my seat. And they also snuck in a few totally-out-of-nowhere scares that I don't think anyone could have seen coming. If you're a fan of gore, then you will be disappointed in this movie. But if you want a movie with scares so chilling they won't leave your mind for quite some time, a movie that masterfully builds suspense to the point of breaking every last nerve of the viewer and a story that I have yet to see in any other movie... then spend the $4 and have good time.",4,"Original, creepy indie horror film.",1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,1349,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'offered', 'Amazon', 'campy', '80', 'horror', 'movies', 'excluded', 'was', 'mood', 'something', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'scary', 'watch', 'morning', 'Not', 'easy', 'task', 'someone', 'seen', 'watching', 'trailer', 'movie', 'Youtube', 'definitely', 'seemed', 'shot', 'was', 'really', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'have', 'only', 'ever', 'written', 'one', 'other', 'review', 'felt', 'one', 'was', 'time', 'somewhat', 'low-budget', 'production', 'value', 'quality', 'was', 'still', 'perfectly', 'good', 'enough', 'sound', 'lighting', 'issues', 'etc', 'even', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'succeeded', 'truly', 'creeping', 'one', 'certainly', 'did', 'haunting', 'graphic', 'images', 'were', 'time', 'really', 'horrifying', 'even', 'built', 'tension', 'big', 'scares', 'thus', 'giving', 'away', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'happen', 'still', 'found', 'jumping', 'seat', 'also', 'snuck', 'few', 'totally-out-of-nowhere', 'scares', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', ""'re"", 'fan', 'gore', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'want', 'movie', 'scares', 'so', 'chilling', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'mind', 'quite', 'time', 'movie', 'masterfully', 'suspense', 'point', 'breaking', 'last', 'nerve', 'viewer', 'story', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'other', 'movie', 'then', 'spend', '4', 'have', 'good', 'time']",Absentia

Absentia is that movie.  The acting at first, in the initial scenes between the two sisters, felt a little forced, but the actors quickly fell into their roles.This movie is more notable for the *absence* of what you expect to see -- massive special effects, explicit gore, spoon-fed explanations -- that characterize today's horror movies, and you find yourself continually and distractingly surprised that the movie actually achieves more without them than it would have with them.  You find yourself cynically marvelling that you're actually shivering at a CGI-less scene.  Just the *hint* of what the creature looks like is far more effective than actually showing the thing in graphic detail would be, because they show just enough to make your imagination fill in the blanks from your own fears and squick-zone.

Plus, the acting was solid, as was the photography and music and editing.Ignore the cover of the DVD with the woman being dragged away. That seems like a marketing decision to lure people in. This movie is much better than the cheesy cover suggests. They should have gone with the silhouette figure standing in the tunnel.The premise, without spoilers: Tricia's husband Daniel disappeared seven years ago, and she is about to have him declared dead in absentia. Her sister Callie comes to stay and to help Tricia find a new apartment. Soon Tricia starts having terrifying visions, and Callie senses something eerie about the nearby tunnel.This is just the kind of horror film that you want if you enjoy a slow build of dread (like in Brad Anderson's ""Session 9""). There is this palpable feeling of melancholy throughout ""Absentia"" that most American horror features don't usually have. It is not a typical scary film that Hollywood puts out; it's thoughtful and it does not spoon feed to the viewer. No cheapo jump scares here, no gallons of gore.

It has a missing husband -presumed dead after seven years- who keeps appearing in spectral form to his wife. Then, the story shifts drastically, changing into a monster movie. For a low-low-budget film, ABSENTIA is superb. I enjoyed the realistic bond, full of pain as well as joy, between the two sisters.

Most of the time, however, money spent on them could've been money that I could have saved. All too often; plots of the movies are, basically, regurgitated material from other movies with amateur acting at best. Most movies are worth watching only once and forgotten about. What's weird is that, even though Absentia is low-budget with above-average acting, Absentia is one of those movies you might want to watch a second or third time through. Like another reviewer who posted on this same movie, days later after seeing the movie, I still think about it. Despite its' low-budget, it's not your run-of-the-mill flick. Character, mood, and atmosphere are the three key things that really drive this film and, needless to say, the movie really got under my skin.The story is about a woman named Tricia, who's husband is missing. Seven years pass and, just when she's ready to move on with what's left of her life, He reappears in a tunnel. Her sister, Callie, who's there to support her soon realizes that there's a connection between the tunnel and several encounters that's happend near it. Make no mistake, though, it might not be much of a plotline but it sure comes to one satisfying(albeit confusing) conclusion..believe me.Absentia is an exceptionally written and directed psychological horror movie.

1519223,A3ITYWFTPW71H2,B006QWC2ZC,Brett Talley,"[4, 6]","For whatever reason, ""intelligent"" is a word you rarely use to describe horror movies. Maybe it's because writers think they can get away with slapping pretty much anything on a piece of paper when they are writing a screenplay. Maybe it's because characters usually have to do some pretty stupid things to get in horrifying situations. I don't really know the answer. And that's why movies like Absentia are as rare as they are pleasing to watch.I'll let the distributors of the movie tell you what it's all about:Tricia's husband has been missing for seven years. Her younger sister Callie comes to live with her as the pressure mounts to finally declare him 'dead in absentia.' As Tricia sifts through the wreckage and tries to move on with her life, Callie finds herself drawn to an ominous tunnel near the house. As she begins to link it to other mysterious disappearances, she comes to the realization that his presumed death might be anything but 'natural.' Soon it becomes clear that the ghostly force at work in the tunnel might have set its sights on Callie and Tricia too.Absentia is character driven horror with a Lovecraftian bent. Whatever lurks in the tunnel near Tricia's house has been around for a very long time, something we learn as Callie--who has her own dark secrets in her past--begins to investigate. The terror is, of course, somewhat limited--it's not like the tunnel is going to move--but it portends a lot of horrifying consequences. If here, why not anywhere? Who can say what dark forces lurk just outside our doors? And where do all those people who just up and disappear go to, anyway?Well worth the money and time, Absentia is great fun for any horror fan willing to put aside the faster pace and dumber scares of your typical scary flick fare.4 out of 5 Stars",4,Character driven horror with a Lovecraftian bent.,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,1795,"['reason', 'intelligent', 'word', 'rarely', 'use', 'describe', 'horror', 'movies', 'Maybe', 'writers', 'think', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'slapping', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'piece', 'paper', 'when', 'are', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'characters', 'usually', 'have', 'do', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'things', 'get', 'horrifying', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'answer', 'why', 'movies', 'Absentia', 'are', 'as', 'rare', 'are', 'pleasing', 'watch.I', ""'ll"", 'let', 'distributors', 'movie', 'tell', 'what', 'Tricia', 'husband', 'been', 'missing', 'seven', 'years', 'younger', 'sister', 'Callie', 'live', 'pressure', 'mounts', 'finally', 'declare', ""'dead"", 'absentia', 'Tricia', 'sifts', 'wreckage', 'tries', 'move', 'life', 'Callie', 'drawn', 'ominous', 'tunnel', 'house', 'link', 'other', 'mysterious', 'disappearances', 'realization', 'presumed', 'death', 'might', 'be', 'anything', ""'natural"", 'Soon', 'clear', 'ghostly', 'force', 'work', 'tunnel', 'might', 'have', 'set', 'sights', 'Callie', 'Tricia', 'too.Absentia', 'character', 'driven', 'horror', 'Lovecraftian', 'bent', 'lurks', 'tunnel', 'Tricia', 'house', 'been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'something', 'learn', 'Callie', 'who', 'own', 'dark', 'secrets', 'past', 'investigate', 'terror', 'course', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'not', 'tunnel', 'going', 'move', 'lot', 'horrifying', 'consequences', 'here', 'why', 'not', 'anywhere', 'Who', 'can', 'say', 'what', 'dark', 'forces', 'lurk', 'just', 'doors', 'where', 'do', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'up', 'disappear', 'go', 'anyway', 'Well', 'money', 'time', 'Absentia', 'great', 'fun', 'horror', 'fan', 'willing', 'put', 'aside', 'faster', 'pace', 'dumber', 'scares', 'typical', 'scary', 'flick', 'fare.4', '5', 'Stars']",Absentia

There is no gore, very little violence, and no torture or any of that kind of stuff. Instead, this movie is driven by the eerie atomsphere, a chilling mystery, and a revelation at the end that is very unsettling.This is the type of movie that makes you think a little. It disturbs you, and leaves you wanting more, even though the ending is somewhat conclusive to the film's story. The acting is fine, the pace could be a little faster but the slower pace is essential for creating the atmosphere the film needs to succeed. This film is more for fans of the ""Twilight Zone"" than for fans of the ""Saw"" movies; it is 180 degrees from a torture film.But after you watch this, and think about it for a while, it is dark and disturbing and it takes you to places that movies rarely attempt to venture.

To help her cope, her wayward sister Callie (Katie Parker) moves in.  Callie starts going for jogs, passing through a tunnel near the women's house.  Before long, Tricia's nightmares of guilt become a little too realistic...as Callie has a few strange encounters of her own.  Then events really take a turn for the macabre, and the sisters are forced to confront the nightmare that lurks so close to their home...an evil force that is growing ever more hungry...This isn't a creature feature.  This isn't a ghost story.  It's almost a fable, itself based on the childhood story ""Three Billy Goats Gruff.""  It's a tale of growing tension and psychological terror, heightened some some fantastic camerawork and editing, and earthy, realistic acting by all characters involved.  (Cops who act like real cops and not mindless morons!  Who would've figured?)  There's practically no gore, and yet ABSENTIA manages to be wholly and thoroughly unsettling...mainly because of what you don't see.  And sorry, fans of gore and monsters and things that go visibly bump in the night...you don't see a whole lot.  ABSENTIA is subtle.  It works itself under your skin and stays there.  Writer/director Mike Flanagan is clearly a talent on the rise.  ABSENTIA will never gain the popularity it deserves; just look at the cover art, which completely sells the film as something else.

1519232,AYG1U47VFZ165,B006QWC2ZC,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[6, 12]","I've seen a lot of horror films in my lifetime.  I'm not bragging, and I'm certainly not proud of it.  Most film fans like me have.  Generally speaking, horror films are a dime a dozen, often times cheaply made for new studios, so there tends to be a glut of them available from time to time.  What I've found though - when I've tried debating the merits of what genuinely frightens me - is that I tend to gravitate more to those films that don't insist on showing me everything.  It's a subtle difference that most horror fans appreciate: you don't have to parade the endless hacking and slashing and slicing and dicing to scare me.  I believe there's far more trepidation in seeing the killer coming at me, walking at me in the dark, knowing there's no escape from his clutches, no quenching his insatiable need to take another life, another soul.  It's then that I'm really scared.  The flashing of his bloodied instrument as he cuts open yet another victim always feels gratuitous to me.For example, showing me the Creeper's underground hideout in JEEPERS CREEPERS is always vastly more frightening than displaying exactly how the monster caught, killed, and stitched all of those lustful young people into the walls of his lair.There's something to be said by leaving much of the shock off-screen, prowling through the dark recesses of my mind, where it'll continue to scare me for far longer after the credits roll and the lights come up.  Then, I'm left to ponder the endless possibilities of `what comes next' all on my own, away from the forced constructs a viewing experience requires, and it's only at that point when I can truly come to grips with whether or not the film truly got to me, whether it accomplished its goal of entertaining me in a way only a terrific horror film can.Consistently moody and atmospheric, ABSENTIA is that rare cinema delight that bursts out of the dark, serving up old-fashioned scares while still producing a uniquely original ghost story.  It's a simmering dreadfulness, punctuating by minimal special effects and exceptional camera trickery, all backed up with a story that relies on the bare bones humanity of its central players.  Thankfully, its fright is not accomplished with buckets of blood and trails of severed limbs, a trait that's ruined far too many horror films in the last two decades.  Rather, ABSENTIA's scares always stick near and dear to one's mind, grounded in the very real experience of what happens after Tricia has her husband missing for seven years declared legally dead.  That alone is a chilling enough experience; following that acceptance up with the grim reality that his `disappearance' may've been anything but naturally explained produces chills aplenty.Why?Because with this smart script there's always a rational alternative.  There's always a voice of reason.  There's always a logical explanation.  That's precisely how a picture like ABSENTIA toys so successfully with the audience's emotions: just when you think it's become crystal clear that these events must be supernatural in nature, another character steps up to the plate with a theory that rips the proverbial rug out from under you.  It's when the most likely explanation becomes the least plausible that the real fun begins ... because imagining what's lurking out there at the dark end of the tunnel is always far, far more fearsome than showing it.In my opinion, horror purists have plenty to celebrate with ABSENTIA.  It's score is sparse, mostly relying on a few tracks that oddly hint at equal parts menace and harmony.  The players - Courtney Bell as the grieving Tricia and Katie Parker as her sister (and recovering addict) Callie - offer performances grounded in humanity and pathos; they're real people recovering from real injuries, making the consequences of what they suffer all the more dire.  As I've already pointed out, the film is replete with excellent camera work, delving creatively in and out of focus as often as the director creeps in and out of shadows and light; it's nothing short of masterful work that adds depth to the storytelling and the overall anxiety of the characters trapped within these frames.  The sound work is incredible, repeatedly toying with levels and clarity, always pushing the unsuspecting viewer to listen more closely.  Its coloring is understandably muted, and, yes, for us old school scare fanatics, writer/director Mike Flanagan even managed to work in a damsel-in-distress in her underwear while still not making it gratuitous and exploitative!  Can you imagine that?  Also, the script is chocked full of enough subtle twists and turns - all plying and playing around the central emotional mystery of missing persons - that Hitchcock himself would no doubt turn green with envy.ABSENTIA is exactly the kind of independent cinema that deserves to be uncovered, acknowledged, and celebrated.  I find it no surprise that the film served as an Official Selection to the 2011 Fantasia Film Festival and the 2011 Toronto `After Dark' Festival.  Equally, I find no shock in recognizing that it won ""Best Horror Feature"" at the 2011 Shriekfest, as well as claiming the prize of ""Best Narrative Feature"" at the 2011 Sonoma International Film Festival.  The disc comes complete with two separate commentary tracks, some additional features regarding the film's history and development, as well as deleted scenes and a trailer.  There are also a handful of trailers for other scary features available from Phase 4 Films.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the kind folks of Phase 4

1519235,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B006QWC2ZC,G. Teslovich,"[5, 7]","Negatives:(1.) Misleading DVD cover. Didn't look like that in the movie and such scenes occurred just a couple of times for maybe a second or two.(2.) No subtitles for either English hard of hearing or Spanish speakers. First sign of cheap.(3.) Almost 400 special thanks contributors. Second sign of cheap budget.(4.) Usual reliance upon missing people newspaper clippings (this is getting so old) to tell our story of suspense. Usual reliance on the same scene shown over and over and over as a obvious suggestive clue - in this case a long walk through tunnel with the obligatory white light at the end and spiders with their webs.(5.) Special effects consist of fabric representing a solid wall and someone pushing from the opposite side to represent someone's inside the wall. Usual underground beings snatching a human every so often. Underground beings appear in very brief flashes (about one second) as sort of spider like. Usual cheap dragging of a person who seems to be capable of nothing but briefly grabbing the ground or some post. Total number of scenes with effects is around four and total time allocated about one minute. Usual ghost image or illusions showing up every so often to scare the viewer. Really just looks like someone at Halloween with bad makeup.(6.) Usual scene of girl in bathroom with moving closed shower curtain -  nothing there, just a dirty bathtub. Who keeps their shower curtains closed all the way anyway?(7.) Usual dumb cops. If I was a national union for police officers I would sue Hollywood for how frequently cops are portrayed in similar negative ways.(8.) To explain how beings can live in a suburb we are given the middle school chemistry lecturer hook that matter (atoms) are just 90+% empty. So beings can live in those spaces.

I just finished watching Absentia and must say I was quite disappointed by it after having read all of the glowing reviews on the net. Don't be fooled! This is a slowwwwwww moving movie. There where times when I wanted to turn it off because of boredom. Pretty much nothing happens for the first hour except character development. Not much happens in the last half hour of the movie either, which is when things are supposed to be climactic. You catch a few shadowy glimpses of ""some"" creature. You get to see plenty of shots of a tunnel(where the creature resides) from a distance and up close. The ending is extremely lame, even for low budget films. They had all this buildup through the film, but unfortunately there was no payoff at the end.I guess what saves this movie from me giving it a one star rating is the acting. More specifically, the emotional trauma played between the two main characters. That's the best thing about this low budget independent horror film. Which is nice to see since most independent horror flicks have pretty bad acting. There's not really many ""main actors"" but the handful there is does a darn good job. My problems(BIG) with this film is that it's a creature film with no creatures we ever see. It briefly hints/tells what kind of creature it is, but never really reveals it(only in shadows and then you know kind of what it is but not what it looks like). In other words, the where attempting quiet horror over shock horror and failed. The tunnel I mentioned earlier is never explored once the pieces of the puzzle is put together. How creepy and scary would that have been to go in the lair of the creature and see it and it's victims housed in there? Very, I do believe.Nothing about this movie was suspenseful or scary. At all. Which is why I'm baffled at all the glowing reviews. Maybe if you like your horror movies of the quiet variety where the monsters are never revealed in the ""flesh"" and you can use your imagination to fill in the gaps(BIG), then this may be your cup of tea and I could maybe see someone giving it 3.5 stars. But 5 stars! Some of the statements other reviewer made about how great this movie is are a bit ludicrous. Such as going to so far to say this is the best independent horror film in a decade or so. Yeah. Right.A character driven movie with no suspense or scares to speak of all in the vain of quiet horror that's supposed to unsettle you with the unseen. Sorry not here folks. Everyone has differrent opinions but I don't see how anyone can call this a great(or even good horror flim) and say it's frightening or scary. Don't get me wrong. I like quiet ghostly horror movies. When they are effective. Sadly most of them aren't, especially those in the world of low budget films. I probably would have given this movie 3 stars if they had shown the creature and it's lair and victims a time or two. I'm not saying it had to jump out and start ripping people limb from limb. Violent or not, I wanted it effective and chilling. What I am saying is why make a creature flick if you're not going to show the creature and use it in nasty and disturving ways? Seems pointless not to. Skip this one and find something else to rent. I say 2 stars out of 5 or a 4 out of 10. Not the worst I've seen, but also a longgggg way from being the best I've seen.",2,IF YOU LIKE QUIET HORROR MOVIES WHERE CREATURES ARE UNSEEN YOU'LL PROBABLY LIKE IT...

1519240,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B006QWC2ZC,J from NY,"[0, 2]","""Absentia"" is a film which requires that the viewer be open to suggestion of a very subtle sort.  Made on what I suspect was a shoestring budget, it reminded me of some particularly eerie stories by Robert Aickman or Ramsey Campbell.  The two central characters, Callie (Katie Parker) and Trisha (Courtney Bell), are estranged sisters who reunite when Callie decides it's finally time to declare her husband Daniel officially dead (""in absentia"", as it's called)  instead of missing.  Callie, a recovering drug addict, returns home to be with her sister during this stressful time.  And boy, do things get stressful.At first Trisha seems fine and it's revealed that she's pregnant.  Her love interest is a cop who'd been following Daniel's case from the beginning and is probably relieved Trisha's let Daniel go.  The thing that's so unnerving about the film is that precisely the things you would find the most horrifying personally happen and they happen in a *believable* way.  When Trisha and the cop are making out in a car, an emaciated and pale Daniel shows up at her house, looking more like a four time victim of the holocaust than a healthy human being.  He is pale, livid, and panicked about something that happened in the tunnel he claims to have been staying at for the past 3 years.  This is when the teeth of the film really grow.  Callie notices during her morning jogs that there's a sort of brothership in the tunnels, a demented link between these vagrants she encounters.  She traces back the history of the tunnel Daniel emerged from and finds that it has an odd history of disappearances.Director Mike Flanagan works the nerve of our worst fear (oblivion without cause, explanation, or meaning) and creates what is destined to be a cult horror film.

Sure, it has its flaws (like any small-budget independent film, and even many big-budget Hollywood films), but unlike those films, it's absolutely original and unique, and I have to be honest here --- I am a horror writer and a huge horror junkie, but I have never seen a film quite like ""Absentia."" The DVD cover art is misleading. Yes, there's a monster in it, but the story's main focus is driven by a psychological character study. The monster plot is reserved for the background. The core theme of the film is the emotional trauma between the two main characters. They go through so much in the film's short run time, and their performances are so natural and convincing, that I couldn't help but feel sorry for them more and more as the film progressed. This is one of the few horror films I have ever seen in which I felt so much sympathy for the characters. It's a perfect balance of character-driven drama and creepiness, and the film did an amazing job of evoking that horrible feeling of ""What's in the dark?"" and ""What was that noise?"". Also, the musical score was perfect in combining both heartfelt emotion and a sense of deep dread. It felt like a really well-written book being played out on screen. Watching the special features was extremely interesting, as well, learning that the cast and crew was so small, that it was filmed in the director's real apartment, that the main actress really was pregnant, that the actor playing the detective is really a waiter at a restaurant, etc. As a writer, knowing that these people pulled off something so effective in such a short time with hardly any money at all is so inspiring to me.

Flanangan maintains an atmosphere of dread and even cleverly leaves enough doubt in our minds that keeps us on edge as to whether this is a product of denial and emotional distress, or, is it really the work of something else.

Writer/director Flanagan pulls off an incredible feat with this film. He manages to reinvent the ghost story,  then takes it to an unexpected, even creepier place.Don't be fooled by the show-burn pacing, because the almost-suffocating tension had me squirming in my seat, forgetting to breathe.It's been almost a year since I've seen ABSENTIA.  What haunts me most is not the disturbing visuals or even the deeply unsettling story line.  It's the mood.

Perron ""Philip""","[2, 7]","If one looks at the box cover art for this film, it appears strictly to be a horror film but this film is so much more than that.  What we have is a human interest story  with thriller elements that may be a horror film deep within the screenplay's core.  If you are the type of individual that likes strong character development and mysteries that slowly fill in pieces of the plot you'll enjoy this movie tremendously.  As I was watching it the story went in various directions that made you wonder if the plot was simply focusing on a missing person and two women trying to come to grips within a place and time in their lives.  But more adequately, the movie begins to fill in with details that may be a greater mystery relating to lost folks grounded in plot devices right out of an Arthur Machen story.  With our two lead protagonists appearing to be unreliable narrators, the film slips into the unknown even more so.  I'm trying to be as vague as possible since everyone should go in knowing nothing about this film.  If you are looking to introduce someone to horror films, this is a good place to start since the thriller and mystery aspect of the plot give it a great cross over appeal (unlike what the box cover may present, ha ha).

The sister out of rehab comes to stay & help her sister move out of the apartment she lived in with her missing husband & move on with her life. The rehab sister goes for a run every morning she happens to go thru a tunnel & it seems fine until her way back when she finds a man just laying in the middle of the tunnel he looks in bad shape & is asking for help but she won't listen & tells him she will bring him some food. Later that evening she takes a bowl of leftovers to the tunnel & leaves it at the opening. Later she finds a pile of jewelery at her door & takes it to the tunnel & lays it at the opening saying she didn't want anything in return for the food,,,a young man walks up behind her with a garbage bag & leaves it & tells her she shouldn't give them anything.The pregant sister keeps seeing her missing husband & of course no one else can. She finally agrees to go out with 1 of the cops that have been working on her case as they leave she sees her husband standing in the street & tries to ignore him until the cop sees him also.

And to them, I say ""Watch 'Absentia,' if you dare.""'Absentia' does what all good horror should do - makes us confront some of our most deep-seated fears in a novel way. Horror is not always about blood and gore. At its best, horror takes a common fear and makes it uncommon, approaches it with something otherworldly to make us see it differently. At its heart, 'Absentia' deals with the pain of grief and loss, the need for closure, and the fear of moving on - but it does so while scaring the crap out of you.It's a simple premise - Callie is visiting her sister Tricia, whose husband has been missing for seven years, to support her as she tries to complete the process of having her husband declared dead ""in absentia"" and move on with her life. Tricia is seeing things in the shadows and hearing whispers, which her therapist convinces her is part of the grieving process in a traumatic time. Callie is also witness to some strange things, from the vagrant lying in the underground tunnel she jogs through who asks if she can see him to the movement of the shower curtain in an empty tub.If you think you know where this is going, you're probably wrong - 'Absentia' is nothing if not surprising. And I'm not planning to give any away here.'Absentia' sets itself apart in its ability to set a pervasively creepy mood throughout. From the simple concrete tunnel connecting two neighborhoods to unique camera angles to the underpinning of an unusual musical score, there's very little in this movie that doesn't feel off somehow. Shot by shot and moment by moment, the atmosphere of dread builds and builds. Very few horror films have had this kind of effect on me, but 'Jacob's Ladder' and '1408' both come to mind for a similar tone. In short, this is not a movie that goes for shock value or the ""gotcha"" moment. Instead, it gets under your skin and behind your eyes to get you where it hurts.It helps that 'Absentia' features two smart, flawed, and strong female leads. Callie and Tricia have their issues, and those issues play into the story, but being the vapid stereotypical scream queen is not among them. Instead, these women feel three-dimensional, believable, and very sympathetic. To the last frame these characters feel real. It's refreshing to see a horror movie with a cast of characters I can believe in - it makes what happens to them that much more awful.I learned in the credits that 'Absentia' was funded in part through Kickstarter, which makes me appreciate it all the more. While most big studio horror films are the same remakes and gore-fests time and again, this little independent project of someone with a vision gives me hope for horror films again.'Absentia' is intelligent, original, surprising and sets a consistent tone of dread from beginning to end. It dares to be both scary and deep - to dig into our psyche and stir up the primal fear of losing those we love most.No ordinary horror film, this.

I saw a number of bloggers give it the Canadian equivalent of a Best in Show award, and determined I'd check it out when it came to DVD. (I knew better than to think it would ever appear on the big screen in Cleveland, though I was intrigued enough to ask if it could be added to the Capitol Theatre's all-night horror-thon in October. Which obvioiusly didn't happen.) That determination was sharpened when the end of the year rolled around...and a lot of those same critics--plus more--started putting &lt;em>Absentia&lt;/em> on the tops of their best-of-the-year lists. (In fact, the only movie I saw top more of those was &lt;em>Drive&lt;/em>.) By the time I got my hands on a copy thanks to the good folks at Netflix, I had already seen one film that would be in contention for best-of-2011, &lt;em>Bellflower&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>Drive&lt;/em> was sitting on the mantel waiting for me to get to it.It no longer matters. &lt;em>Absentia&lt;/em> is a movie so good that there are few years in which it &lt;em>wouldn't&lt;/em> be the best film of the year. My first impression was that with a clearer head and a few day's distance, I might be able to find some things about the movie that would make me knock it down to four and a half stars; I can't remember the last time I gave out two five-star movie reviews in the space of a month (cf. &lt;em>Jeux Interdits&lt;/em> review 13Mar12).

For the record, &lt;em>Ikiru&lt;/em> would be the last film to which I have a five-star review for two years.] But I've given the movie those few days, I've read other reviews of the film and examined the criticisms, I've examined the things I thought I might eventually become less than thrilled with, and I should mention ""other people's criticisms of the film"" and ""things I thought might have been weak"" are mutually exclusive categories (more on that later), and I realized that it didn't matter how much I was going to pick at this film, it is sheer, unadulterated gold.Plot: Tricia (&lt;em>Step Up 2: The Streets&lt;/em>' Courtney Bell)'s husband Daniel (&lt;em>Nailed&lt;/em>'s Morgan Peter Brown) disappeared seven years ago, and she is headed towards filing to have him declared dead in absentia. Her sister Callie (&lt;em>Cut&lt;/em>'s Katie Parker), a former narcotics addict now in recovery (and on the religion kick), is in town to offer moral support, and Detective Mallory (&lt;em>Asylum&lt;/em>'s Dave Levine), who took over the investigation after the original detective retired, is also hovering close. And here's the first question this film will make you ask: if the husband has been missing for seven years, how is Tricia pregnant? (An answer is suggested. Pay attention. I have seen way too many people ask this question.)None of which sounds like a horror film. Which is both one of the movie's strongest points and one of the things that has caused such great ire from disappointed people on comment threads at places like IMDB: for most of its length, &lt;em>Absentia&lt;/em> is not a horror film at all, especially not in the sense we in the 2010s think of a horror film. To understand where Flanagan is coming from, you have to go back farther than that, to a period where people remembered what horror films are actually for--the examination of feelings of fear and heartbreak that accompany loss. And the first half of this film is absolutely, and completely, about Tricia's feelings towards Daniel's disappearance and her guilt at having him declared dead. It's a drama, not a horror film, and when the supernatural stuff does start appearing (and it does in the second half of the film), it is there mostly to augment the drama rather than provide a horror element. (I feel an urge to compare this to &lt;em>YellowBrickRoad&lt;/em> in this regard, though &lt;em>Absentia&lt;/em> is a far superior film.)I've seen two main criticisms of the film that actually hold water (there is a small batch of people who are criticizing the film's near-perfect script, which makes absolutely no sense to me, so I'm not going to even consider that one), though I found neither bothersome at all. The first is that this isn't actually a horror film. I think I've already covered that one, and when it comes right down to it, it's not the movie's fault if it was mismarketed (or if you think it was mismarketed). The second has to do with the movie's soundtrack, and I've seen this criticism from professional critics as well as the hoi polloi posting on the message boards. I did notice some repetition, but really, folks, if you thought that was bad, go watch &lt;em>The Turin Horse&lt;/em>, one of the best movies made in 2010 despite having a soundtrack that contains just two pieces (one of which is far more grating than the main theme here could ever dream of being). When I was looking at things I might want to ding the film for, I focused more on the acting, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought Bell and Parker were going for that kind of &lt;em>cinema verit&eacute;&lt;/em> feel a la Cassavettes, and was willing to let it slide. Other than that, there's nothing at all I can fault this movie for. Pitch-perfect pacing, one of the better scripts I've come across in a horror movie in years, very good cinematography, well-drawn characters with realistic emotional reactions... I really have nothing at all bad to say about this movie. But do yourself a favor and go into it with no expectations. This is not a horror film like any that has been released in the past thirty-odd years, and if you're looking for that sort of experience, look elsewhere. For the rest of us, &lt;em>Absentia&lt;/em> is one of the best movies of the past decade. *****",5,One of the best films of 2011 hands down.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,6029,"['lt', 'strong', '>',

What it is is a very low-key horror film built around a group of damaged, emotionally frayed people whose everyday concerns blind them to the evil presence that is mostly responsible for their wounds.

The people in this film have no idea they're living in a horror story, and you'd be amazed what a difference that makes.

It was second tier all the way, especially during those sad scenes which ran way too long. There were a number of times I thought Courtney Bell forgot what role she was playing. And the third thing was the boom mike visible in the upper right hand corner in a midway scene that involves Callie walking into the bathroom.

1519276,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B006QWC2ZC,Thomas M. Sipos,"[1, 5]","ABSENTIA isn't your typical contemporary horror film. No slashers or zombies or romantic vampires or Japanese crawling ghosts. Instead, ABSENTIA is a creepy and intelligent supernatural/Locecraftian thriller, with strong dramatic/human subtext and religious/spiritual themes.Tricia's husband, Daniel, disappeared seven years ago. She's still posting ""Has anybody seen this man?"" flyers on trees, but she's about ready to move on. She's pregnant with another man's child. She's also kinda, sorta seeing this detective. (The film intimates the unborn child is his, though that's never made clear.)Since it's been seven years, the County of Los Angeles will soon declare Daniel officially dead, and Tricia can begin dating detective Mallory -- openly rather than sorta, kinda.Then Callie, Tricia's prodigal sister, returns home. Tricia and Daniel had raised the troubled Callie, a runaway druggie who left to backpack across the U.S. But Callie has cleaned up her act. She's a Christian now, in contrast to Tricia's Buddhism.It's okay. The two sisters love and respect each other.Then Callie notices something ominous about that creepy, dark tunnel near Tricia's home. Callie can't say for sure why it feels wrong. A homeless man babbles nonsense in the tunnel. (Is he just another homeless crazy?) A teenager leaves a plastic bag by the entrance. (What's inside -- and who is the intended recipient?)You won't see much of That Which Lurks In The Tunnel. ABESNTIA is minimalist horror. Its monster is intimated rather than seen in long, lingering shots. This may disappoint some gorehounds, but I found ABSENTIA's brief, murky shots to be just right. Perfect, even.We see shadows. Brief shots of tentacles and feelers -- a bit reptilian, a bit insectisoid. It's all very Lovecraftian. ABSENIA is not specifically based on a Lovecraft story, yet H.P. is clearly one of the film's inspirations.A strong spirituality also informs ABSENTIA. Callie lives her Christianity. She makes the mistake of reaching out to the homeless man in the tunnel, bringing him food. This lures the monster back to Tricia's home.It seems these creatures have been abducting people for centuries, dragging them into their lair, which is both beneath the city and in another dimension of space/time.Although spiritual, ANSENTIA is never preachy. All of its characters are flawed, yet all of them -- Tricia, Callie, detective Mallory, and the deranged Daniel -- try to do the right thing. But these Cthulhuian creatures -- who move through the walls of houses unlucky enough to overlap their dimensions -- are more than most, even good-hearted, mortals can handle.ABSENTIA's dramatic minimalism is supported by its soundtrack. We hear sound effects that may or may not be monsters -- discreet, difficult-to-identify noises. It sorta sounds like an insect? The music consists of simple, moody melodies that simultaneously support the film's domestic strife and enhance the creepy atmosphere.Part of ABSENTIA's strength is that its domestic story (of sisters and lovers and estranged spouses -- and their emotional conflicts) is well interwoven with its tale of Lovecraftian creatures. The fear and anger engendered on those two dramatic levels support, and play off of, each other. When Callie reports seeing a giant insect, Tricia blows up at Callie, suspecting her of regressing to her drug habits. ""The last time you saw insects, they were crawling under your arm!""Director/writers Mike Flanagan is a master of minimalist horror.

If this were a student film I'd be willing to applaud the effort, but as a film distributed for the masses, I expected more.  As such, the look of the film is enough to take the viewer out of the experience of watching a movie.

1519280,AI0PLL5DQAHRG,B006QWC2ZC,"Ty Arthur ""xFiruath""","[2, 6]","For anyone who hasn't ever seen the movie, I recommend skipping all reviews entirely. It's best to go in knowing nothing so everything is a surprise and each layer of the movie can have its full impact. For those who are going to read anyway, this part of the review is completely spoiler-free.  Anyone considering the flick should know ahead of time that the cover art is amazingly misleading. This is not a slasher movie of any kind, and while it may qualify for the tag ""low-budget,"" it's definitely not your typical direct-to-DVD terrible B horror movie.With the possible exception of one detective character, the acting is very strong and really carries the movie. ""Absentia"" has an understated quality to its horror themes, which is overall actually very benign and deals with loss and the unknown more than anything that goes bump in the night.  A strength of the film is that several different options are presented from different character's view points as to what actually is happening.  Much like ""The Last Exorcism,"" two people can watch the movie and one will come away thinking something supernatural must have happened, while the other will be convinced everything is perfectly explainable by normal events.If you choose to believe the supernatural version, then this movie deserves to be called ""Lovecraftian."" Not in the common sense of the term meaning slimy tentacled things, but rather in the sense that the horror is cosmic in nature, utterly alien to human understanding, and completely impossible for the protagonists to overcome.This next part of the review is now going to be filled with massive spoilers, so stop reading here until you've seen ""Absentia."" After having seen the movie multiple times now, it seems to me the most likely course of events is that Walter's son kidnapped Danny, and then kept both Walter and Danny prisoner underground for years. Somehow they managed to escape, but they were delirious from dehydration, malnutrition, and an utter lack of human contact for years.Meanwhile, the main character Tricia is suffering a breakdown due to mounting bills, the guilt of being pregnant when she doesn't know what happened to her husband , and the stress of having Danny declared legally dead without an explanation of his disappearance. Coupled with pregnancy hormones, this breakdown causes her to experience visual and auditory hallucinations. What's interesting is that this seems to be only the explanation for this segment of the movie - the filmmakers seem to make a point that the woman seeing the ""ghost"" of her husband is completely non-supernatural, even if there are really monsters from another dimension later on. This fact makes me think the rest of the movie is meant to be followed in a non-supernatural fashion as well.After escaping, Danny makes his way home to find his wife clearly pregnant. After seeing his wife kiss the detective, he either runs away or is re-kidnapped by Walter's son, who has already previously broken into the house looking for his escaped victim.  The bug creatures are clearly just a hallucination brought on by Callie's abuse of hard drugs. Watching the movie through a second time you'll notice she only starts to see the strange things in the bathroom after taking the drugs, and her hallucinations start with a bug in the sink - just as her previous breakdowns had in the movie's back story. No one else ever sees these creatures, and they are just her way of dealing with what's going on. The scene where she is attacked in the bathroom may have been real however, as the form that jumps out of the shower is human, not bug-like, and may have been Walter's son coming to reclaim his victim. After her husband goes missing for a second time and her sister goes back on the drugs, Tricia gives up her current life and decides to just disappear and start over.There's only really one aspect of the movie that makes it seem like the bug monsters are real, which is when Walter's son shows up at the crime scene with a dog in a bag, apparently as some sort of sacrifice to appease the monsters. But considering how everything else pretty much points to a human monster being the cause of it all, personally I think this was just a red herring.With strong acting, great atmospheric music, and a slick but understated style, ""Absentia"" is a horror gem that's well worth checking out. The multiple possible answers to all the questions also makes it a real conversation starter and a great flick to watch in the dark with some of your horror loving friends.",5,An understated horror gem that focuses on its strengths and drops everything else,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,4543,"['anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'reviews', 'entirely', 'best', 'go', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'so', 'everything', 'surprise', 'layer', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'full', 'impact', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'read', 'anyway', 'part', 'review', 'completely', 'spoiler-free', 'Anyone', 'considering', 'flick', 'should', 'know', 'ahead', 'time', 'cover', 'art', 'amazingly', 'misleading', 'not', 'slasher', 'movie', 'kind', 'may', 'qualify', 'tag', 'low-budget', 'definitely', 'not', 'typical', 'direct-to-DVD', 'terrible', 'B', 'horror', 'movie.With', 'possible', 'exception', 'one', 'detective', 'character', 'acting', 'very', 'strong', 'really', 'movie', 'Absentia', 'understated', 'quality', 'horror', 'themes', 'overall', 'actually', 'very', 'benign', 'deals', 'loss', 'unknown', 'more', 'anything', 'bump', 'night', 'strength', 'film', 'several', 'different', 'options', 'are', 'presented', 'different', 'character', 'view', 'points', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'Much', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'something', 'supernatural', 'must', 'have', 'happened', 'other', 'will', 'be', 'convinced', 'everything', 'perfectly', 'explainable', 'normal', 'events.If', 'choose', 'believe', 'supernatural', 'version', 'then', 'movie', 'be', 'called', 'Lovecraftian', 'Not', 'common', 'sense', 'term', 'meaning', 'slimy', 'tentacled', 'things', 'rather', 'sense', 'horror', 'cosmic', 'nature', 'utterly', 'alien', 'human', 'understanding', 'completely', 'impossible', 'protagonists', 'overcome.This', 'next', 'part', 'review', 'now', 'going', 'be', 'filled', 'massive', 'spoilers', 'so', 'stop', 'reading', 'here', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Absentia', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'multiple', 'times', 'now', 'most', 'likely', 'course', 'events', 'Walter', 'son', 'kidnapped', 'Danny', 'then', 'kept', 'Walter', 'Danny', 'prisoner', 'years', 'Somehow', 'managed', 'escape', 'were', 'delirious', 'dehydration', 'malnutrition', 'utter', 'lack', 'human', 'contact', 'years.Meanwhile', 'main', 'character', 'Tricia', 'suffering', 'breakdown', 'due', 'mounting', 'bills', 'guilt', 'being', 'pregnant', 'when', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'husband', 'stress', 'having', 'Danny', 'declared', 'legally', 'dead', 'explanation', 'disappearance', 'Coupled', 'pregnancy', 'hormones', 'breakdown', 'experience', 'visual', 'auditory', 'hallucinations', 'What', 'interesting', 'be', 'only', 'explanation', 'segment', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'make', 'point', 'woman', 'seeing', 'ghost', 'husband', 'completely', 'non-supernatural', 'even', 'are', 'really', 'monsters', 'dimension', 'later', 'fact', 'think', 'rest', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'followed', 'non-supernatural', 'fashion', 'well.After', 'escaping', 'Danny', 'way', 'home', 'find', 'wife', 'clearly', 'pregnant', 'seeing', 'wife', 'kiss', 'detective', 'either', 'away', 're-kidnapped', 'Walter', 'son', 'who', 'already', 'previously', 'broken', 'house', 'looking', 'escaped', 'victim', 'bug', 'creatures', 'are', 'clearly', 'just', 'hallucination', 'brought', 'Callie', 'abuse', 'hard', 'drugs', 'Watching', 'movie', 'second', 'time', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'only', 'see', 'strange', 'things', 'bathroom', 'taking', 'drugs', 'hallucinations', 'start', 'bug', 'sink', 'just', 'previous', 'breakdowns', 'had', 'movie', 'back', 'story', 'one', 'else', 'ever', 'creatures', 'are', 'just', 'way', 'dealing', 'what', 'going', 'scene', 'where', 'attacked', 'bathroom', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'however', 'form', 'shower', 'human', 'not', 'bug-like', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Walter', 'son', 'coming', 'reclaim', 'victim', 'husband', 'missing', 'second', 'time', 'sister', 'back', 'drugs', 'Tricia', 'up', 'current', 'life', 'just', 'disappear', 'start', 'only', 'really', 'one', 'aspect', 'movie', 'bug', 'monsters', 'are', 'real', 'when', 'Walter', 'son', 'up', 'crime', 'scene', 'dog', 'bag', 'apparently', 'sort', 'sacrifice', 'appease', 'monsters', 'considering', 'how', 'everything', 'else', 'pretty', 'much', 'points', 'human', 'monster', 'being', 'cause', 'personally', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'red', 'herring.With', 'strong', 'acting', 'great', 'atmospheric', 'music', 'slick', 'understated', 'style', 'Absentia', 'horror', 'gem', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'multiple', 'possible', 'answers', 'questions', 'also', 'real', 'conversation', 'starter', 'great', 'flick', 'watch', 'dark', 'horror', 'loving', 'friends']",Absentia

This isn't DRAG ME TO HELL. But, I suppose if it gets a few more people to check this movie out it isn't all bad.I want to praise this film specifically for the two lead actresses and the tunnel location, which is a character in itself. Except for one or two unfortunate ""information dump"" sequences and narrative leaps of telling-not-showing, (and that's the fault of the script and direction)these women give two natural, quietly compelling performances (and it's a nice uninitentional (given the casting process) bonus that they happen to be normal women with average body-types). I often forgot they were actresses playing parts. The same can't be said, well, in my opinion, at least, for the male actors playing the detectives. For the most part, their acting is a distractingly stark contrast to the women. Especially the more aggressive one. (the other male actors are quite good, though)HOWEVER, this is nitpicking, when the film as a whole is so good. It's not perfect by any means, but, it's one of those movies which used to be called ""sleepers""; worth seeing because it rises above its faults. I especially appreciated the way the story addresses doubt and memory. And you'd have to be incredibly hard-hearted not to relate to Tricia's feelings as her plans get yanked out from under her. If you're not a fan of intentionally ambiguous horror, this probably isn't for you. If you feel cheated by not being shown ""everything"", you'll definately be disappointed in the approach to the dark forces at work in the story (I actually felt the film would've benefitted from one less flash of reveal). All this aside, when a small movie can make a simple bathroom as realistically scary as this does, it's way above the majority of horror junk food out there. This leaves an impression afterwards that's a bit deeper than needing to pick your popcorn bucket off the floor.",4,"""TRADE! TRADE!
