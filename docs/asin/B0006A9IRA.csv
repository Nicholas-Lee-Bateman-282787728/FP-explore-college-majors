864705,A1TET60NZOM8HK,B0006A9IRA,A Reader,"[2, 2]","Got this as a gift, so I can't complain too much.  However, the one real Bruce Lee movie in the set I already had a copy of.  Mostly this is a collection of Sonny Chiba movies of mixed quality.Some of the movies have been cropped to look like widescreen, but you can tell that they got cropped too much, cutting off part of words that were on the bottom of the screen and/or cutting off people's heads at the top of the screen.  What's the point?  They probably copied it from VCR and cropped it to fool people into thinking they are watching a digitally re-mastered movie. The cropping was particularly obvious on Shogun's Ninja, and Ninja Wars is obviously copied from VCR tape with a noisy sound track and occasional tracking lines.  Honestly, I have duped better quality VCR copies on my home DVD recorder.The best quality is The Street Fighter, which also seems to be the movie that made Chiba famous, mainly because it is so shockingly violent.  There are scenes where he punches holes into people or pulls out hunks of their flesh from sensitive parts of their bodies.  Very nasty.  In fact, I read somewhere else that when the movie was first released in the U.S. they gave it an X rating because it was so violent.Anyway, rule of thumb with these old martial arts movies seems to be that when you buy them in big collections you should not expect good quality.  While it might sound good you are getting 14 hours of entertainment for small change, you should keep in mind that you always get what you paid for.  So, set your expectations low with this collection.",1,"mixed quality, not enough of Bruce",1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,1572,"['Got', 'gift', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'However', 'one', 'real', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'movie', 'set', 'already', 'had', 'copy', 'Mostly', 'collection', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'movies', 'mixed', 'quality.Some', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'cropped', 'look', 'widescreen', 'can', 'tell', 'got', 'cropped', 'too', 'much', 'cutting', 'off', 'part', 'words', 'were', 'bottom', 'screen', 'cutting', 'off', 'people', 'heads', 'top', 'screen', 'What', 'point', 'probably', 'copied', 'VCR', 'cropped', 'fool', 'people', 'thinking', 'are', 'watching', 'digitally', 're-mastered', 'movie', 'cropping', 'was', 'particularly', 'obvious', 'Shogun', 'Ninja', 'Ninja', 'Wars', 'obviously', 'copied', 'VCR', 'tape', 'noisy', 'sound', 'track', 'occasional', 'tracking', 'lines', 'Honestly', 'have', 'duped', 'better', 'quality', 'VCR', 'copies', 'home', 'DVD', 'recorder.The', 'best', 'quality', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'also', 'be', 'movie', 'made', 'Chiba', 'famous', 'mainly', 'so', 'shockingly', 'violent', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'holes', 'people', 'out', 'hunks', 'flesh', 'sensitive', 'parts', 'bodies', 'Very', 'nasty', 'fact', 'read', 'somewhere', 'else', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'U.S.', 'gave', 'X', 'rating', 'was', 'so', 'violent.Anyway', 'rule', 'thumb', 'old', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'be', 'when', 'buy', 'big', 'collections', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'good', 'quality', 'might', 'sound', 'good', 'are', 'getting', '14', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'small', 'change', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'always', 'get', 'what', 'paid', 'So', 'set', 'expectations', 'low', 'collection']",N/A
864706,A1LEJPSQ3TD538,B0006A9IRA,Jeff Roper,"[1, 1]","This is one of my favorite DVD sets I own. Sonny Chiba's ""The Street Fighter"" is one of the most violent Kung-Fu films you will ever see. Blood flying all over the place. The only other one I can think that is gorier has to be ""Ricky-O"". Great action, music, story and cinematography. This set is well worth it just for this film alone. The first disc has only one Bruce Lee film in ""Fist of Fury"" and if you don't own any of his films at least you'll have this one in your collection if you pick this up. Sure, the transfer isn't all that great. But, who cares? For this price you can't really go wrong. On the other hand, ""The Street Fighter"" looks and sounds beautiful. Sonny Chiba fans rejoice.
