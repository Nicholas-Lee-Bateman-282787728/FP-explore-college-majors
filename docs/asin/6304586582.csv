I'm sorry to hear that...We can not blame the actors here. No, this is sloppy, horrific, editing and direction. The director it would seem had a hard time coaxing the best from his actors, who, while not overtly talented, could've been motivated and bumped to do better. Sloppy direction combined with useless editing (some of the worst I've seen), wrecked this movie from attaining B-flick status. Still...This is good for laughs (see the getting pulled over sequence) no doubt about it. From the goofy Indian (played by a white dude), to that mildly retarded wolf, over to the wretched make-up. The script is dreadful...and that's a good thing if you're looking for fun.I have, believe it or not, seen worse.

429092,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6304586582,Michael Butts,"[2, 3]","FEVER LAKE is tedious, derivative, full of plot holes and inconsistencies.  Corey Haim, the glory boy of the 80s, tries playing a college freshman, and even though he still looks pretty young, he doesn't look young enough to be that.  Add Bo Hopkins as the local sheriff, looking dyspeptic to say the least and Michael Wise as a demon spouting Indian, you have the first inclination of the movie's problems.  IN the opening scene, a father chops up his wife, and looks up at his son who has been hidden in the attic and says &quot;You're cursed..just like me.&quot;  Then his eyes glow green and that's it for that segment.  Segue into the present day (although one has to wonder; the opening sequence looks like it was in the 40s; if that was the case, the little boy would be at least in his fifties by now).  Anyway, Corey has invited five of his friends to join him at where else, Fever Lake, for a weekend getaway.  Of course, the townspeople don't cotton to strangers so they immediately suspect the kids of something, although the local teen waitress tells them the gory history of Fever Lake, which is reinforced by the local fish bait store manager.  If you listen to his tales, you will find that the script doesn't stick to the stories; for instance, there's no little boy this time.  Well, the evil finally gets released from the lake and the kids find themselves hacked up....if you can't figure out who the killer is, you haven't watched enough slasher films.This wouldn't be so bad, but the acting is abysmmal, the direction shoddy, and the background music altogether annoying and inappropriate.FEVER LAKE will go on Mr. haim's resume as another attempt to recapture the youth of the 80s.",2,MERCURY FALLING,1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,1704,"['FEVER', 'LAKE', 'tedious', 'derivative', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'inconsistencies', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'glory', 'boy', '80s', 'tries', 'playing', 'college', 'freshman', 'even', 'still', 'pretty', 'young', ""n't"", 'look', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'Add', 'Bo', 'Hopkins', 'local', 'sheriff', 'looking', 'dyspeptic', 'say', 'least', 'Michael', 'Wise', 'demon', 'spouting', 'Indian', 'have', 'first', 'inclination', 'movie', 'problems', 'IN', 'opening', 'scene', 'father', 'up', 'wife', 'up', 'son', 'who', 'been', 'hidden', 'attic', 'quot', ""'re"", 'cursed..just', 'me.', 'quot', 'Then', 'eyes', 'glow', 'green', 'segment', 'Segue', 'present', 'day', 'one', 'wonder', 'opening', 'sequence', 'was', '40s', 'was', 'case', 'little', 'boy', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'fifties', 'now', 'Anyway', 'Corey', 'invited', 'five', 'friends', 'join', 'where', 'else', 'Fever', 'Lake', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'course', 'townspeople', 'do', ""n't"", 'cotton', 'strangers', 'immediately', 'suspect', 'kids', 'something', 'local', 'teen', 'waitress', 'gory', 'history', 'Fever', 'Lake', 'reinforced', 'local', 'fish', 'bait', 'store', 'manager', 'listen', 'tales', 'will', 'find', 'script', ""n't"", 'stick', 'stories', 'instance', 'little', 'boy', 'time', 'Well', 'evil', 'finally', 'released', 'lake', 'kids', 'find', 'hacked', 'up', '.if', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'killer', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'enough', 'slasher', 'films.This', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'acting', 'abysmmal', 'direction', 'shoddy', 'background', 'music', 'altogether', 'annoying', 'inappropriate.FEVER', 'LAKE', 'will', 'go', 'Mr.', 'haim', 'resume', 'attempt', 'recapture', 'youth', '80s']",Fever Lake VHS
