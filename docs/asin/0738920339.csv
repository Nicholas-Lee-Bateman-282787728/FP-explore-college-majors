Members of Stomp and other Sesame Street clips show us that music is all around us--we can make music with anything!  All the rhythmic clapping, tapping, banging on pots (always a fun toddler activity), and singing really keep my 17 month old daughter enthralled.

My daughter fell in love with it the first time we watched it and asks for it repeatedly.  More importantly, it is not overly annoying to adults.How I rated this DVD:* Educational value.  Since buying this DVD my daughter has become very interested in making her own music.  I have found her stomping, making drums from rubbermade containers, and trying to blow in bottles.  She is only 20 months old and I think this is very impressive since we have only had the tape a few weeks.* Entertaining to child.  Keeps her entertained through the whole video.* Entertaining to adults.  I can even watch the tape with her and not become mindlessly numb.* The DVD starts right at the menu.  No annoying commercials to sit through.* Cost.  The video did not break the budget.

In this video, Telly learns that music can be made from many different things, as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the ""can can"" part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue (""Cans?  We've got cans!"" and ""Yeah, we'll go get them!"").  Trust me, you've got to see that part.

Combining the Sesame Street habitat with animation and live-action video tape keeps the pace moving.  The variety of musical experiences is remarkable.

There's a wonderful sequence  that choreographs cracking eggs and slamming doors.  It's a terrific tape and our 2-year old has gotten a lot from it.One word of advice for those with younger kids.
