Webb ""love to groove""","[0, 0]","For me what I look for first in a kung fu movie is good power packed, well thoughtout, visually pleasing fight scenes, in the process if a reasonable story line and fine acting is included you have a first class movie. Well in this film  I felt like I got the action packed fight scenes which is ongoing but didn't produce the other attributes not a bad movie.",3,Good fight movie,1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,360,"['what', 'look', 'first', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'good', 'power', 'packed', 'well', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'process', 'reasonable', 'story', 'line', 'fine', 'acting', 'included', 'have', 'first', 'class', 'movie', 'Well', 'film', 'felt', 'got', 'action', 'packed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'ongoing', 'did', ""n't"", 'produce', 'other', 'not', 'bad', 'movie']",Empire Of Assassins
1430920,AYWSFRCIMOAYE,B004WSA4CK,Cestmoi,"[1, 1]","- This movie looks exactly like a cheap TV show. Many of the sets look fake.- Some of the fighting scenes are good. Some are bad because of poor editing and filming.- The fighting scenes are non stop from the beginning of this film to the end. There's no time for character development. For example, the 2 brothers fought against each other in many scenes. Each time,  one of the brother had a chance to kill the other brother but he stopped it when seeing a big scar on that guy's neck. Then the director did not give the characters time to investigate the scar further. He just showed the two fighting again and again in the following scenes. And then the same guy stopped the fighting when he saw the same scar again. It's so silly that it's boring.- In short, it's a waste of money. I'd rather watch Iron Monkey again.",1,This empire crumbled to pieces,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,822,"['movie', 'exactly', 'cheap', 'TV', 'show', 'Many', 'sets', 'look', 'fake.-', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'bad', 'poor', 'editing', 'filming.-', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'non', 'stop', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'example', '2', 'brothers', 'fought', 'other', 'many', 'scenes', 'time', 'one', 'brother', 'had', 'chance', 'kill', 'other', 'brother', 'stopped', 'when', 'seeing', 'big', 'scar', 'guy', 'neck', 'Then', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'characters', 'time', 'investigate', 'scar', 'further', 'just', 'showed', 'two', 'fighting', 'again', 'again', 'following', 'scenes', 'then', 'same', 'guy', 'stopped', 'fighting', 'when', 'saw', 'same', 'scar', 'again', 'so', 'silly', 'boring.-', 'short', 'waste', 'money', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'again']",Empire Of Assassins

1430923,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004WSA4CK,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The movie opens with some ""defy the laws of physics"" type of fighting, which I enjoy. It seems the Emperor wants to destroy all martial art fighting schools so he can reign supreme without fear of uprisings. The movie jumps 15 years ahead as a man tries to kill the Emperor. He is eventually captured placed in confinement, gets out, almost gets killed, gets better, gets arrows in both arms and can still fight 4 ninja warriors at once. He is helped and hindered by the Emperor's daughter, who thinks she know who he is. The Emperor also has a son, who apparently was the son of one of the man he killed, but he doesn't know that. He is also the brother of the would be assassin, who does know that. Got that?The dubbing into English at times was fine, but when they fought, the grunts almost seemed comical. The soundtrack at times was modern, but also resorts back to traditional Chinese style of music. It is a tough film to watch. I would recommend getting your ninja fix elsewhere. Don't blame me, I warned you. Let me put it this way: I will be giving my copy away for free. It should be a crime to charge for it.",1,TIRESOME TO WATCH,1311724800,"07 27, 2011",2011,1120,"['movie', 'defy', 'laws', 'physics', 'type', 'fighting', 'enjoy', 'Emperor', 'destroy', 'martial', 'art', 'fighting', 'schools', 'can', 'reign', 'supreme', 'fear', 'uprisings', 'movie', '15', 'years', 'ahead', 'man', 'kill', 'Emperor', 'eventually', 'captured', 'placed', 'confinement', 'out', 'almost', 'killed', 'better', 'arrows', 'arms', 'can', 'still', 'fight', '4', 'ninja', 'warriors', 'once', 'helped', 'hindered', 'Emperor', 'daughter', 'who', 'know', 'who', 'Emperor', 'also', 'son', 'who', 'apparently', 'was', 'son', 'one', 'man', 'killed', ""n't"", 'know', 'also', 'brother', 'would', 'be', 'assassin', 'who', 'know', 'Got', 'dubbing', 'English', 'times', 'was', 'fine', 'when', 'fought', 'grunts', 'almost', 'seemed', 'comical', 'soundtrack', 'times', 'was', 'modern', 'also', 'back', 'traditional', 'Chinese', 'style', 'music', 'tough', 'film', 'watch', 'would', 'recommend', 'getting', 'ninja', 'fix', 'elsewhere', 'Do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'warned', 'Let', 'put', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'giving', 'copy', 'away', 'free', 'should', 'be', 'crime', 'charge']",Empire Of Assassins

Years after his family is killed Zhang (Tse) finally finds who he has been looking for, the murderer.  The only problem is that it is his brother who he must defeat in order to get to him.  Not being a huge fan of martial arts type movies I did think that this one looked good in the preview.  What I found was a very low budget movie that was not that enjoyable.  I will say that of the ones that I have seen have Jet Li and Jackie Chan in them, and the quality of action between them and the lesser known actors is huge.  The choreography is very poor, and looks just short of what a school play would be like.  The movie did have some pretty cheesy parts but the story was good.  The only problem is that the bad action takes away from the story, it may have been better if the left the fighting out actually.  Also, I don't usually comment on the technical aspects of the DVD, like camera work etc... but the dubbing (I watched the original Chinese version) was so bad that the mouths didn't match the sounds.  I can understand if they are off in the english dubbing, but not the original.  It was almost so bad that you found yourself thinking about that instead of the movie.  I don't know if it says more about the sound or the movie itself.  Overall, maybe hardcore martial arts fans will like this.  I did not.  I say C.Would I watch again? - No I won't*Also try - Warrior's Way & Fearless",2,"Really neat idea, brother vs brother martial arts movie.  Story was good, fighting was bad, movie was cheesy.
