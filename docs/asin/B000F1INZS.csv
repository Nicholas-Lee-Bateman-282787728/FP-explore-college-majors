981256,A3E1UIGSVRQXQ,B000F1INZS,"Bobby Brady ""Radioman970""","[0, 0]","This is a series I should have seen when it originally aired, but I have no recollection.  I would have been about 14 or so, perfect age for this.  No telling what I was watching on some other channel while these little gems were on.As an adult, I am thoroughly pleased with this wonderful set of stories... being filmed in their country of origin using actors from those countries and a narrator who speaks my language (English).  Really, this couldn't be better than the way it is on these DVDs.  The stories are all timeless tales... and having them in this form can only keep them alive a good while longer.  I can't express how thrilled I am that I grabbed one of these sets at the last minute and can watch these forever.I sincerely hope this collection gets another release so others can discover them like I did.  Funny, I discovered this myself after having some interest in Shelley Duvall's shows...  I enjoy Fairy Tale Theater, but Storybook is a bit more entertaining for me personally.I noticed this entire program is on youtube.  I watched the first story, called Clever Manka, and was hooked.  When the set arrived in the mail I watched that one again. Wonderful!  These reminds of stuff I actually did grow up on, like tapes of Superscope Storyteller, or shows like ABC Weekend Specials and Wonderworks on PBS.  Quality television for kids that was so good at the time, even with me approaching 50 I can still sit back and enjoy them even when nostalgia isn't the only thing driving my enjoyment.I hope more gems like this get releases and I hope I see them before they are gone.",5,Now out of print...,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,1595,"['series', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'have', 'recollection', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'about', '14', 'so', 'perfect', 'age', 'telling', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'other', 'channel', 'little', 'gems', 'were', 'adult', 'am', 'thoroughly', 'pleased', 'wonderful', 'set', 'stories', 'being', 'filmed', 'country', 'origin', 'using', 'actors', 'countries', 'narrator', 'who', 'language', 'English', 'Really', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'way', 'DVDs', 'stories', 'are', 'timeless', 'tales', 'having', 'form', 'can', 'only', 'keep', 'alive', 'good', 'while', 'longer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'how', 'thrilled', 'am', 'grabbed', 'one', 'sets', 'last', 'minute', 'can', 'watch', 'forever.I', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'collection', 'release', 'others', 'can', 'discover', 'did', 'Funny', 'discovered', 'myself', 'having', 'interest', 'Shelley', 'Duvall', 'shows', 'enjoy', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'Theater', 'Storybook', 'bit', 'more', 'entertaining', 'personally.I', 'noticed', 'entire', 'program', 'youtube', 'watched', 'first', 'story', 'called', 'Clever', 'Manka', 'was', 'hooked', 'When', 'set', 'arrived', 'mail', 'watched', 'one', 'again', 'Wonderful', 'reminds', 'stuff', 'actually', 'did', 'grow', 'up', 'tapes', 'Superscope', 'Storyteller', 'ABC', 'Weekend', 'Specials', 'Wonderworks', 'PBS', 'Quality', 'television', 'kids', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'time', 'even', 'approaching', '50', 'can', 'still', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'even', 'when', 'nostalgia', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'driving', 'enjoyment.I', 'hope', 'more', 'gems', 'get', 'hope', 'see', 'are', 'gone']",Storybook International Collection Set
981257,A2TS040W2FW5O,B000F1INZS,Heidi Anne Heiner,"[130, 132]","Having never viewed this series when it originally aired, I had the privilege of viewing it while the DVDs were in preproduction. The large variety of tales from all over the world is impressive. I also didn't expect the episodes to be so entertaining or well-produced considering native speakers and actors were used to film each tale in the land it came from. This is the most comprehensive and collection of folktales on film for family viewing to date. It is also highly recommended for public libraries and similar collections. With 65 episodes, it is also reasonably priced. In the end, this series is entertaining and educational.Episode Guide1.

981264,A2HF7VO2KZMXU6,B000F1INZS,Thomas H. Ayers,"[25, 25]","I came across this title unexpectedly and, based on the previous two reviews, decided to give it a shot.  This set of 10 DVDs covers 65 folktales from around the world, and each episode is filmed on location and acted by indigenous actors.Our reaction:  We watched our first episode tonight.  After a lovely song introducing the series, we watch A Hundred Cattle from Africa.  My kids loved it and were very intrigued by the people, their way of life, and how they handled problems.  This particular story was narrated, and the narrator spoke the actors' parts as the actors, through facial expressions and gestures, illustrated the story.  The overall effect felt like being read to as the book's pictures came to life.  I suspect all of the episodes are done this way.What You Get:  The boxed set consists of two cases, each containing five discs which are stacked on top of each other.  I've never seen DVDs packaged this way before.  I'm tempted to buy thin cases to hold each DVD separately to avoid damage.  Also, the set contained a loose disc to replace disc 5 from volume 1.  I'm not sure why - I presume it replaces a defective disc.  I'm glad they corrected the problem before I found out about it the hard way!  The shows are over twenty years old, but the picture and sound are acceptable.Warning:  I bought this used on Amazon without ANY problem.  However, while researching this title, I discovered that some dealers are confusing ""The Ugly Duckling"" with Storybook International - perhaps because of similar UPC codes?  Beware of prices below $15, because you might get ""The Ugly Duckling"" instead of this - ask before buying.  I paid under $30 for this set and got what I paid for--I'm pleased with my purchase.Based on one episode, I think this set of folktales is an amazing value.
