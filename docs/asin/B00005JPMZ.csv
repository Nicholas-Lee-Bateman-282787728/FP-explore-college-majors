Though even if I hadn't been a fan as a child I would have still enjoyed this movie. It has character development, action, comedy, and a collective team orientation- even the foot soldiers joined the turtles to overcome the obstacle. I think its a great film for any age. I am also pleased that they will be another (based on how it ended.) The only thing that as a female bothered me is how they portray females even in animation. In this animation April and the leader of the foot soldiers were both sexy gals with tremendous curves- couldn't we get the average gals with the average physiques (I don't remember April being vuluptous and she def wasn't sexy besides she looks like a Teenager herself in this one and she should be atleast in the mid to late 20's.)",5,Great!,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,869,"['just', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'nostalgic', 'watched', 'twice', 'big', 'ol', 'smile', 'face', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'fan', 'child', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'character', 'development', 'action', 'comedy', 'collective', 'team', 'orientation-', 'even', 'foot', 'soldiers', 'joined', 'turtles', 'overcome', 'obstacle', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'age', 'am', 'also', 'pleased', 'will', 'be', 'based', 'how', 'ended', 'only', 'thing', 'female', 'bothered', 'how', 'portray', 'females', 'even', 'animation', 'animation', 'April', 'leader', 'foot', 'soldiers', 'were', 'sexy', 'gals', 'tremendous', 'curves-', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'average', 'gals', 'average', 'physiques', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'April', 'being', 'vuluptous', 'def', 'was', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'Teenager', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'atleast', 'mid', 'late', '20']",N/A

653269,A3EW4TUSY1HAXC,B00005JPMZ,Andrew Mcdonald,"[3, 5]","Given the new CGI technology, I believed it was possible to reboot the franchise but this TMNT movie doesn't do that.  Did anyone really care about the monsters or the immortality story?  I didn't and I thought of that as just a cheap way to fill the time with a bunch of swordfighting.  Here are some random thoughts about the film (from a lifelong TMNT fan):The only character that I truely did care about in the movie was Raphael and he gets the most time on screen.  His resentment towards Leo and his quest for independence gives this film what very little dimension it has.  The only moment in the movie of pure excitement that had me on the edge of my seat was the battle between Raph and Leo.Leonardo gets a lot of attention in this film also but I always found him to be too one dimensional and because he's supposed to be the flawless leader, the most boring.  On the positive side, he does look more bad-a$$ in this film than the 80s cartoon and the 90s movies.Michelangelo was my favorite character from the TV show but I was somewhat disappointed with his role in this film.  He scarcely says 2 consecutive sentences in a row, being reduced to just making wise-cracker remarks when the opportunity presents itself.  Yes, some of them are funny but I wanted more from him.  The only part of the movie that is truely his is the opening scene where he is scateboarding through the sewers (didn't they already do this in the first live-action movie?).I don't remember anything at all about Donatello except he has a job helping people with computers.  I hardly remember a line of dialogue from him and he's the least visable turtle.Splinter is just like he's always been, nothing worthy of making note except he has a different voice.  April looks totally different (much younger) and, although I was initially against her new look, it warmed on me as the movie went along.  The main thing I didn't like was that she's now a sword-fighter which is totally inconsistent with everything I've seen from the character and was totally unnecessary and was just intended to get us to say ""oh wow, April can swing a sword"".Overall, given the new technology I feel like there were several other routes this movie could have taken with more successful results.  Instead of making this a sequel to the live-action movies it should have simply retold the story (from the beginning).  They could have begun the movie when Splinter was still human and show how he was banished to the New York sewers and then got 4 pet turtles who later became mutant turtles and so on.  Another thing is that because this is CGI, they could have for the first time in a TMNT movie used Krang and the always funny duo Rocksteady and Bebop.  That would be a hell of a lot better than monsters no one is going to remember.I would not recommend that someone who has little invested in the TMNT to buy this film or even rent it.  Watch it on youtube for free (shhh, don't tell anyone I told you that).  I wouldn't even recommend that lifelong TMNT fans buy this even if the bluray disc is really good.  Just rent it and don't have high expectations.I'm on the fence about whether I want there to be another TMNT movie. I just hope they get it right if they decide to give it another try.",2,"As a lifelong TMNT fan, I was surprised when this movie (almost) made me not care about the characters",1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,3261,"['Given', 'new', 'CGI', 'technology', 'believed', 'was', 'possible', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'TMNT', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'Did', 'anyone', 'really', 'care', 'monsters', 'immortality', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'thought', 'just', 'cheap', 'way', 'fill', 'time', 'bunch', 'swordfighting', 'Here', 'are', 'random', 'thoughts', 'film', 'lifelong', 'TMNT', 'fan', 'only', 'character', 'truely', 'did', 'care', 'movie', 'was', 'Raphael', 'most', 'time', 'screen', 'resentment', 'towards', 'Leo', 'quest', 'independence', 'film', 'what', 'very', 'little', 'dimension', 'only', 'moment', 'movie', 'pure', 'excitement', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'was', 'battle', 'Raph', 'Leo.Leonardo', 'lot', 'attention', 'film', 'also', 'always', 'found', 'be', 'too', 'one', 'dimensional', 'supposed', 'be', 'flawless', 'leader', 'most', 'boring', 'positive', 'side', 'look', 'more', 'bad-a', 'film', '80s', 'cartoon', '90s', 'movies.Michelangelo', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'role', 'film', 'scarcely', '2', 'consecutive', 'sentences', 'row', 'being', 'reduced', 'just', 'making', 'wise-cracker', 'remarks', 'when', 'opportunity', 'Yes', 'are', 'funny', 'wanted', 'more', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'truely', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'scateboarding', 'sewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'do', 'first', 'live-action', 'movie', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'Donatello', 'job', 'helping', 'people', 'computers', 'hardly', 'remember', 'line', 'dialogue', 'least', 'visable', 'turtle.Splinter', 'just', 'always', 'been', 'nothing', 'worthy', 'making', 'note', 'different', 'voice', 'April', 'totally', 'different', 'much', 'younger', 'was', 'initially', 'new', 'look', 'warmed', 'movie', 'went', 'along', 'main', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'now', 'sword-fighter', 'totally', 'inconsistent', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'character', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'just', 'intended', 'get', 'say', 'oh', 'wow', 'April', 'can', 'swing', 'sword', '.Overall', 'given', 'new', 'technology', 'feel', 'were', 'several', 'other', 'routes', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'successful', 'results', 'Instead', 'making', 'sequel', 'live-action', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'simply', 'retold', 'story', 'beginning', 'could', 'have', 'begun', 'movie', 'when', 'Splinter', 'was', 'still', 'human', 'show', 'how', 'was', 'banished', 'New', 'York', 'sewers', 'then', 'got', '4', 'pet', 'turtles', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'mutant', 'turtles', 'so', 'thing', 'CGI', 'could', 'have', 'first', 'time', 'TMNT', 'movie', 'used', 'Krang', 'always', 'funny', 'duo', 'Rocksteady', 'Bebop', 'would', 'be', 'hell', 'lot', 'better', 'monsters', 'one', 'going', 'remember.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', 'little', 'invested', 'TMNT', 'buy', 'film', 'even', 'rent', 'Watch', 'youtube', 'free', 'shhh', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'told', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'recommend', 'lifelong', 'TMNT', 'fans', 'buy', 'even', 'bluray', 'disc', 'really', 'good', 'Just', 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations.I', ""'m"", 'fence', 'want', 'be', 'TMNT', 'movie', 'just', 'hope', 'get', 'right', 'decide', 'give', 'try']",N/A

653272,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B00005JPMZ,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[1, 1]","This is the first 3D feature starring the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. From 2007, it was a revamp in the look and tone of the franchise (not the story), and for the most part, it worked well. It has a good story with a very strong central conflict, and good visuals. For the most part, like the 1990 live-action film, it is a strong movie, but it has its flaws.The central conflict of TMNT is very strong. The Ninja Turtles have been in disarray for a time, what with Leonardo in South America to train in becoming a better leader. Because without him, the unity of their group has sort of evaporated and his brothers have become aimless and restless. Of no one is this truer than Raphael. His frustration with Leonardo and their reconciliation with each other (and themselves) is the force that binds this film together. Very strong it is, especially in regards to Raphael and his double-life as a vigilante. I love this core of the film; the character conflicts are very sympathetic.The thing is, the film has another, external story about a millennia-old warlord who is trying to undo a curse he started a long time ago. Well-woven as the two storylines are into one, it still feels like two entirely different stories being told at the same time, and there's no question which is the better one. Leonardo and Raphael's conflict is far more connected to the audience than that of the warlord.The visuals are dark and atmospheric, which I generally never liked in this series, but it works well here. The character animation is brisk and suitably edgy, and the CG-camerawork is wonderful. The environments are spot-on; New York feels huge and bleak. The character designs are mostly very good (the Turtles, Splinter). On the other hand, most of the other ones feel very banal (April in particular looks way too young with her huge head and giant, Bratz-like eyes). The voice acting is, for the most part, heartfelt and genuine, but I don't think Splinter's voiceover works that well as a whole, sometimes his speeches sounding a lot like speeches. It is to thank the strength of the character's dialogue and character animation that his heart still comes through.The action and pace of the film is very well-handled and the film is told in a solid, consistent manner. The story's only holes arise from its lesser half, the warlord's story, in which a number of inconsistencies arise - have those monsters simply been taking a vacation until now? The music is rather inconsistent as well. The orchestrated score works well, but I miss the character in the music this series used to be famous for. A minor berth, true, the score does its job but no tunes are gonna linger on your mind.Overall, TMNT the movie is a worthwhile view, with a strong central plot and character arc that works against a rather banal side-story about the supernatural. That adds up to a rather disjointed film, though, one I cannot easily recommend. Although it is a child of its time, I recommend the 1990 live-action TMNT movie over this one.",3,"Strong Where Its Heart's At, But Flat",1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,3021,"['first', '3D', 'feature', 'starring', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', '2007', 'was', 'revamp', 'look', 'tone', 'franchise', 'not', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'worked', 'well', 'good', 'story', 'very', 'strong', 'central', 'conflict', 'good', 'visuals', 'most', 'part', '1990', 'live-action', 'film', 'strong', 'movie', 'flaws.The', 'central', 'conflict', 'TMNT', 'very', 'strong', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'have', 'been', 'disarray', 'time', 'what', 'Leonardo', 'South', 'America', 'train', 'becoming', 'better', 'leader', 'unity', 'group', 'sort', 'evaporated', 'brothers', 'have', 'become', 'aimless', 'restless', 'one', 'truer', 'Raphael', 'frustration', 'Leonardo', 'reconciliation', 'other', 'force', 'film', 'together', 'Very', 'strong', 'especially', 'regards', 'Raphael', 'double-life', 'vigilante', 'love', 'core', 'film', 'character', 'conflicts', 'are', 'very', 'sympathetic.The', 'thing', 'film', 'external', 'story', 'millennia-old', 'warlord', 'who', 'trying', 'undo', 'curse', 'started', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Well-woven', 'two', 'storylines', 'are', 'one', 'still', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'stories', 'being', 'told', 'same', 'time', 'question', 'better', 'one', 'Leonardo', 'Raphael', 'conflict', 'far', 'more', 'connected', 'audience', 'warlord.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'dark', 'atmospheric', 'generally', 'never', 'liked', 'series', 'well', 'here', 'character', 'animation', 'brisk', 'suitably', 'edgy', 'CG-camerawork', 'wonderful', 'environments', 'are', 'spot-on', 'New', 'York', 'feels', 'huge', 'bleak', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'Turtles', 'Splinter', 'other', 'hand', 'most', 'other', 'ones', 'feel', 'very', 'banal', 'April', 'particular', 'looks', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'huge', 'head', 'giant', 'Bratz-like', 'eyes', 'voice', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'heartfelt', 'genuine', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Splinter', 'voiceover', 'that', 'well', 'whole', 'sometimes', 'speeches', 'sounding', 'lot', 'speeches', 'thank', 'strength', 'character', 'dialogue', 'character', 'animation', 'heart', 'still', 'through.The', 'action', 'pace', 'film', 'very', 'well-handled', 'film', 'told', 'solid', 'consistent', 'manner', 'story', 'only', 'holes', 'arise', 'lesser', 'half', 'warlord', 'story', 'number', 'inconsistencies', 'arise', 'have', 'monsters', 'simply', 'been', 'taking', 'vacation', 'now', 'music', 'rather', 'inconsistent', 'as', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'score', 'works', 'well', 'miss', 'character', 'music', 'series', 'used', 'be', 'famous', 'minor', 'berth', 'true', 'score', 'job', 'tunes', 'are', 'gon', 'linger', 'mind.Overall', 'TMNT', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'view', 'strong', 'central', 'plot', 'character', 'arc', 'rather', 'banal', 'side-story', 'supernatural', 'up', 'rather', 'disjointed', 'film', 'though', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'easily', 'recommend', 'child', 'time', 'recommend', '1990', 'live-action', 'TMNT', 'movie', 'one']",N/A

I mean seriously, with the wrong director, they could easily ruin our much beloved Turtles for future generations. We all, as fans, lucked out and are greeted with a terrific rendition with one of the best stories ever though.The story starts off with the Turtles in complete disarray. Leo is out of the country training to be a better leader, yet also trying to decide if his brothers are better off without him. Raph is out fighting baddies undercover as the metal-clad Nightwatcher. Don is keeping his nerdy schtick going strong by becoming an IT person. And Mikey is working for a party agency where he DRESSES UP AS A TURTLE. Love it.Enter Winters. He was granted immortality centuries ago for the sacrifice of his army. However, he's now set to resurrect his army so he won't be immortal anymore. They find this out and fight back. Then the Turtles come in.I think the greatest thing about this movie is that they centered the light-heartedness of the Turtles around a fairly intense storyline.

653282,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPMZ,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 9]","I willingly went to go see this new version of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" I stood in line. I paid for my ticket. I entered the theater. I stayed for the entire show. Clearly, I had been sucked in by the impressive ad campaign, a collection of high-octane television spots, creative posters, and well edited trailers. I have no idea why I allowed myself to experience this film; I already experienced it seventeen years ago, when the live action version was first released. Yes, I was a fan. But I was also a kid--no more than seven--and as we all know, tastes change as one grows. This new film represents an idea that has already gotten old, and it offers nothing original in terms of characterization, plot, and setting. In short, there was absolutely no reason for ""TMNT"" to be made.This computer-generated cartoon is basically a ninety-minute sequence of nonstop energy, a wall-to-wall montage of chase scenes and physical altercations. Nothing much holds it all together, save for one of the flimsiest stories ever conjured up for an animated film. It begins with the description of a ruthless Central American warrior who lived more than 3,000 years ago. Apparently, he had discovered an inter-dimensional portal, one that would give him immortality if opened during an alignment of certain stars. He does so, only to learn of the price he has to pay: not only was every one of his soldiers turned to stone, but thirteen monsters were unleashed, as well. He was doomed to walk the earth for all eternity, unable to die no matter what.According to the opening narrator (Laurence Fishburne), this 3,000-year-old myth is a new evil to be fought by our sewer-dwelling, pizza-loving heroes in half shells. They have since stopped fighting crime on the streets of New York City; Master Splinter (Mako) has sent the eldest brother, Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor), on a Central American retreat in order to hone his leadership skills. In the meantime, the remaining three Turtles have turned to other lines of work. Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) goes to birthday parties as a costumed character, dressed as ... well, a turtle (complete with a false head). Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) is a Technical Support phone operator for a computer company. Rafael (Nolan North) has failed to get a real job; by night, unbeknownst to everyone else, he's a vigilante crime fighter known only as Nightwatcher.While visiting Central America on assignment, news reporter April O'Neil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) reunites with Leonardo and informs him that he needs to return to New York so that he and the other Turtles can be one happy family again. Sound advice from a news reporter who would actually participate in a martial arts battle. It was obvious that this character's inclusion was merely for the sake of appeasing diehard ""TMNT"" fans. Her role in this film is so minimal that it's practically a cameo. She serves mostly as a second half to her boyfriend, the clumsy wannabe crime fighter Casey Jones (Chris Evans).O'Neil delivers a package to powerful business tycoon Max Winters (Patrick Stewart), one that contains a life-sized warrior statue made entirely of stone. It's quickly established that Winters has ulterior motives for his statue collection, all of which are actually the hardened remains of the cursed Central American warriors. He then teams up with the few remaining members of The Foot, who seem to have lost their way since Master Shredder was defeated. Winters wants them to track down and capture the thirteen monsters that were released 3,000 years ago. This will actually be quite easy, as they've all somehow managed to end up in New York City. But why should that matter? A number of cool looking creatures are given screen time, which is a plus for anyone who cares little for plot and characterization.Upon Leonardo's return, tension between him and Rafael grows deeper: Leonardo feels that it's his responsibility to lead his brothers; Rafael is an impatient hothead who wants to give his own form of justice. Master Splinter seems to be the only one who knows how to patch things up, which is amazing considering how badly he's portrayed in this film. Listening to him speak was grating due to his consistently slurred voice; he sounded more like a drunkard than a wise Japanese rat. He does occasionally give a few words of wisdom. He also enjoys watching soap operas, as noted when he announces that he's off to watch his stories.I could go on describing the plot, why should I bother? It's weak in every way, from the story to the character development to the special effects, all of which amount to nothing more than a cheaply produced video game. It isn't helped by truly awful dialogue; every line was either a pun or a joke, which might have worked had they not been spoken during some very inappropriate scenes (such as when everyone is engaged in hand-to-hand combat). Who would actually be entertained by such mindlessness? I should think that even fans of the ""TMNT"" franchise would be sorely disappointed. And rightfully so: this latest film reduces every character to an insignificant action drone, someone that will fight at the drop of a hat. There's no depth. There's no meaning. It's all eye candy.Can I get a ""Cowabunga, Dude""?",2,Shell Shocked,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,5269,"['willingly', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'new', 'version', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles',

653283,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B00005JPMZ,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[10, 28]","As a child my number one passion in all the world was pro wrestling, but coming in a close second were these stupid ninja turtles. Don't ask me why, and no I don't honestly think that they are somehow better than Transformers or He-Man or whatever your obsession was. So now I am the target demographic for this movie, a man child who never grew up and thus has a nostalgia for all things green plus excess time and money. The problem is that the film is kind of a stinker and even I can't ignore that. Let's start off with the animation which was quite loudly outsourced overseas and was thus produced as a deeply discounted rate. The end result is a second rate job, but considering the sweet deal they got I'm sure the Weinstein's aren't shedding any tears over the quality of the look. What they should be crying over, however, is the dialogue for this movie which I would classify as abysmal. And seriously, I'm not looking for scholarly work here, just a little bit more snap than calling a hairy bad guy Fuzzy Wuzzy. Especially when we consider just how jaded these kids are nowadays, there is no way these jokes worked on anybody other than parents trying to pretend that they are no longer jaded.What the film does basically is tell a dull, generic story that is just a bloated TV episode. This one involves a tiff between Leonardo and Raphael over a difference in personality. We pick things up as the Turtles are getting over their glory days and moving on to the next stage of their life. But Raphael is unwilling to accept this and unable to get over his hero urges, so at night he moonlights as Batman. Leonardo, taking his talking points from Splinter, takes offense and tries to reel in the rebel. To me vigilantism is a big ole waste of energy but not necessarily inferior to the stoic restraint that Leonardo is trying to sell. But alas this is a kids movie and so there must be a lesson to be learned and here it is the importance of top down mentality as the underlings (read: slackers and free thinkers) must take their orders from Splinter (since we learned in ""Karate Kid"" that an Asian accent equals wisdom above all) and his assistant manager Leonardo. The rest is just a blast of white noise. The characters crack wise (or kind of try to) and then fight some bad guys. Evil is overcome and consequences are non-existent.I have no animosity towards this movie, only to say that had I spent $11 on it at a Manhattan theatre I would've viewed that as a poor investment. So instead I paid $0.99 thanks to Amazon Unbox and for a little while forgot about all the debilitating relationship woes I am going through. There is really nothing here to excite the former fans of the show. Other than bringing back the same characters the mythology is not tapped into or advanced... at times it is even desecrated... like do you remember the episode where April is trained as a samurai? Plus the monsters were corny and interchangeable, or straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon.  Most of them simply looked like escapees from early Crash Bandicoot. The voice acting is fine but nothing anybody will ever be proud of. And when the movie ended I simply shrugged my shoulders. . .and wondered if maybe they'd make another one of these movies, because for a dollar I'd totally watch it. **1/2",2,Worth the Dollar I Paid for It,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3306,"['child', 'number', 'one', 'passion', 'world', 'was', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'coming', 'close', 'second', 'were', 'stupid', 'ninja', 'turtles', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'think', 'are', 'somehow', 'better', 'Transformers', 'He-Man', 'obsession', 'was', 'So', 'now', 'am', 'target', 'demographic', 'movie', 'man', 'child', 'who', 'never', 'grew', 'up', 'thus', 'nostalgia', 'things', 'green', 'excess', 'time', 'money', 'problem', 'film', 'kind', 'stinker', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'Let', 'start', 'off', 'animation', 'was', 'quite', 'loudly', 'outsourced', 'overseas', 'was', 'thus', 'produced', 'deeply', 'discounted', 'rate', 'end', 'result', 'second', 'rate', 'job', 'considering', 'sweet', 'deal', 'got', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Weinstein', 'are', ""n't"", 'shedding', 'tears', 'quality', 'look', 'What', 'should', 'be', 'crying', 'however', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'would', 'classify', 'abysmal', 'seriously', ""'m"", 'not', 'looking', 'scholarly', 'work', 'here', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'snap', 'calling', 'hairy', 'bad', 'guy', 'Fuzzy', 'Wuzzy', 'Especially', 'when', 'consider', 'just', 'how', 'jaded', 'kids', 'are', 'nowadays', 'way', 'jokes', 'worked', 'anybody', 'other', 'parents', 'trying', 'pretend', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'film', 'basically', 'tell', 'dull', 'generic', 'story', 'just', 'bloated', 'TV', 'episode', 'one', 'tiff', 'Leonardo', 'Raphael', 'difference', 'personality', 'pick', 'things', 'up', 'Turtles', 'are', 'getting', 'glory', 'days', 'moving', 'next', 'stage', 'life', 'Raphael', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'unable', 'get', 'hero', 'urges', 'so', 'night', 'Batman', 'Leonardo', 'taking', 'talking', 'points', 'Splinter', 'offense', 'tries', 'reel', 'rebel', 'vigilantism', 'big', 'ole', 'waste', 'energy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'inferior', 'stoic', 'restraint', 'Leonardo', 'trying', 'sell', 'kids', 'movie', 'so', 'must', 'be', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'here', 'importance', 'top', 'down', 'mentality', 'underlings', 'read', 'slackers', 'free', 'thinkers', 'must', 'take', 'orders', 'Splinter', 'learned', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Asian', 'accent', 'equals', 'wisdom', 'assistant', 'manager', 'Leonardo', 'rest', 'just', 'blast', 'white', 'noise', 'characters', 'crack', 'wise', 'kind', 'try', 'then', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys', 'Evil', 'overcome', 'consequences', 'are', 'non-existent.I', 'have', 'animosity', 'movie', 'only', 'say', 'had', 'spent', '11', 'Manhattan', 'theatre', 'would', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'poor', 'investment', 'instead', 'paid', '0.99', 'thanks', 'Amazon', 'Unbox', 'little', 'forgot', 'debilitating', 'relationship', 'woes', 'am', 'going', 'really', 'nothing', 'here', 'excite', 'former', 'fans', 'show', 'Other', 'bringing', 'back', 'same', 'characters', 'mythology', 'not', 'tapped', 'advanced', 'times', 'even', 'desecrated', 'do', 'remember', 'episode', 'where', 'April', 'trained', 'samurai', 'monsters', 'were', 'corny', 'interchangeable', 'straight', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'Most', 'simply', 'looked', 'escapees', 'early', 'Crash', 'Bandicoot', 'voice', 'acting', 'fine', 'nothing', 'anybody', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'proud', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'simply', 'shrugged', 'shoulders', '.and', 'wondered', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'make', 'one', 'movies', 'dollar', ""'d"", 'totally', 'watch', '**1/2']",N/A
653284,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPMZ,"Cloud ""...""","[6, 8]","I'll admit that in the early 90's I was a massive Turtles fan. From blankets to this weird mirror to the abundance of toys and even a homemade costume for Halloween, I was quite the diehard. Of course now I grew out of it but still, I just had to check out the film. That's tricky since do you like the film because you were a fan, like the film because it's good or hate it. Well it does have its issues, the film is quite good whether or not you were a nut in the heyday.Taking place after the defeat of Shredder, the 4 have parted ways. Leonardo is in Central America training to be a better leader, Michaelangelo entertains kids at birthdays as Cowabunga Carl, Donatello is an IT tech serviceman while Raphael takes on the persona of the Nightwatcher to help the people of New York. Meanwhile, April is now an archaelogist working for a powerful businessman named Max Winters and in a relationship with Casey Jones.However, 3000 years earlier, someone opened a portal and became immortal and unleashed 13 monsters unto the Earth with his generals being turned to stone. Now with the help of his generals as well as the Foot Clan led by Karai, his plans could end up doing heavy damage around the world so it's up to the Turtles to stop him but with the Turtles at odds with each other, how can they save the world when they can't get along?That's basically the story in a nutshell and it might sound complicated but trust me when I say it isn't. In fact, it's probably a bit too simplistic for some people but considering this is a comic book franchise, it doesn't have to be complex. But like a lot of stories, characters can get sidetracked (Michaelangelo and Donatello feel more like supporting characters than part of the group) and some such as Karai don't get much development or screen time at all. But at least it adds more to the other 2 Turtles as well and there's one scene many will feel is a long time coming.As for voices, nobody really sort of steals the show since they're all good in their roles. As for Mako voicing Splinter, I don't really have an issue with his voice although it's more accent-y than I'd like but maybe I just saw the originals too many times but I loved Splinter's more wiser and older voice from the movies like a grandfather whereas here he sounds like an affectionate uncle. Animation though is superb and while some might chuckle at character designs (why are humans so scrawny looking?), the detail and the scope of it kind of makes up for it. As for the humor, it's mainly Mikey that provides it and at times it feels like we're still in the 90's. Burps, puns and surfer lingo were fine then but considering the more darker look of the film, having a California-sounding guy everywhere doing lowbrow humor might detract some.It's a fair bet to say that there's no doubt a special edition to come since deleted scenes have commentary only and featurettes are minimal at best.

Yeah, fabulous...another cutesy butchering of what was originally a somewhat dark comic series (dark compared to what it is now, anyway). And I know that TMNT is aimed at the younger masses today, so I understand some kiddie-fying to make it sell. Anyway, I was impressed by it. First and foremost, the animation had my attention. I kind of liked the tall, slender look the Turtles were given...as opposed to looking very wide in past incarnations. And all the characters seemed to stick relatively true to their actual personalities: Leonardo being the teacher's pet, Donatello being the geek, Raphael being an angry jerk, and Michealangelo being an idiot with a surfer's voice. Why they turned April into a cutesy teenybopper-looking girl is beyond me, though.The plot was cool - I like how they used a comic book ally (Karai) besides having the Shredder come back to life *again*. And I like how the Turtles kind of went and did their own thing when Leonardo left to go find himself in South America. Sure, they remained in the same home, but rather than fighting crime, they all went and got jobs. Well, save for Raphael. Then again, this struck me as a little odd since in past movies, the Turtles were encouraged by Splinter to not let themselves be seen publicly. Sooo, now that's okay? That threw me off a little.I don't want to spoil it too much for folks who have not seen it, so I'll just say that it is a really good animated film and if you like the Ninja Turtles, it's a pretty nifty film.",5,Glad to see this wasn't butchered,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,1556,"['When', 'heard', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'groaned', 'Yeah', 'fabulous', 'cutesy', 'butchering', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'comic', 'series', 'dark', 'compared', 'what', 'now', 'anyway', 'know', 'TMNT', 'aimed', 'younger', 'masses', 'today', 'so', 'understand', 'kiddie-fying', 'make', 'sell', 'Anyway', 'was', 'impressed', 'First', 'foremost', 'animation', 'had', 'attention', 'kind', 'liked', 'tall', 'slender', 'look', 'Turtles', 'were', 'given', 'opposed', 'looking', 'very', 'wide', 'past', 'incarnations', 'characters', 'seemed', 'stick', 'relatively', 'true', 'actual', 'personalities', 'Leonardo', 'being', 'teacher', 'pet', 'Donatello', 'being', 'geek', 'Raphael', 'being', 'angry', 'jerk', 'Michealangelo', 'being', 'idiot', 'surfer', 'voice', 'Why', 'turned', 'April', 'cutesy', 'teenybopper-looking', 'girl', 'plot', 'was', 'cool', 'like', 'how', 'used', 'comic', 'book', 'ally', 'Karai', 'having', 'Shredder', 'come', 'back', 'life', '*again*', 'like', 'how', 'Turtles', 'kind', 'went', 'did', 'own', 'thing', 'when', 'Leonardo', 'left', 'go', 'find', 'South', 'America', 'Sure', 'remained', 'same', 'home', 'rather', 'fighting', 'crime', 'went', 'got', 'jobs', 'Well', 'save', 'Raphael', 'Then', 'again', 'struck', 'little', 'odd', 'past', 'movies', 'Turtles', 'were', 'encouraged', 'Splinter', 'not', 'let', 'be', 'seen', 'publicly', 'Sooo', 'now', 'okay', 'threw', 'off', 'little.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'too', 'much', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'really', 'good', 'animated', 'film', 'like', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'film']",N/A
653296,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JPMZ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","The trailer looked good, so I went to the theater with high hopes for TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). After having seen the film, well, color me contented. This is the fourth feature film about our fun loving, pizza-scarfing ninja turtles and the second most enjoyable one (in my eyes, nothing can really upstage the awesome first flick, released in 1990). Unlike the first three movies - which were all live-action, with some puppetry thrown in - TMNT is full on, across-the-board CG - and dazzling CG, at that. I've never seen the turtles so dramatically depicted (check out the rooftop scene of Leonardo and Raphael in the rain - just amazing!!).Sadly, the blah storyline doesn't do justice to the spectacular animation. In its cliche-ridden effort, it not only borrows an old fantasy plot device (of the planets being aligned and, thus, causing mystical forces to come into play), it dips some more into that recurring rivalry between the sensible leader Leonardo and the impulsive and often angry Raphael. We even see a half-hearted attempt at a romance between April and Casey (they're now living together). I don't know how much actual sweat and thought went into the crafting of the story, but the finished product comes off as having that by-the-numbers feel.The plot involves a warrior king who, 3000 years ago, sought to gain even more power by opening up a portal to another dimension. The energy from the portal granted the warrior immortality but at the expense of turning his soldiers into stone. At the same time, 13 monsters were released onto our world.Cut to the present, in New York City, where our turtles are going thru a crisis. It seems that Master Splinter had sent Leonardo away to Central America for leadership training a while ago, and Leo's not back yet. With their leader's absence, the three remaining turtles have drawn apart, with each brother branching off and doing his own thing. Mikey has ventured into the business of entertaining at children's parties in his guise as Cowabunga Carl (as Carl, he dons a huge turtle mask over his real turtle noggin!). Donatello has started his own at-home tech support endeavor. And Raphael sleeps all day.But things change when fearsome monsters and stone warriors begin appearing in NYC. The Foot clan, as well, begins to make noise, now under the leadership of the sexy Karai. And with frequent sightings of an enigmatic nighttime vigilante known as the Nightwatcher, you just know Leo picked a good time to come back to the sewers. Mikey and Donatello welcome him back with open arms. Raphael? Well, he has issues...When Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird debuted their first issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles way back in 1984, they obviously had no idea that their creation would become such a world wide juggernaut. I'm a fan of their work. I'm talking about the issues they themselves actually wrote and drew. The stuff after that, when they got so busy with the managing of their TMNT empire that they hired other artists to put out the issues, well, I can take those or leave 'em. This picture takes the turtles back to their roots in terms of grit and seriousness. In its sensibilities and its darker mood, TMNT hearkens back to classic Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. Not much of that Saturday morning cartoon vibe in this one, although Mike does let loose with an occasional ""Cowabunga!"" The humor's still here, mind you (and mostly provided by Mikey); it's just not as prevalent.The voices are well cast, with Patrick Stewart (Prof. X, Capt. Picard) lending his distinctive pipes to Max Winters, the mysterious entrepreneur with an agenda. Chris Evans (Casey), Sarah Michelle Gellar (April), and Ziyi Zhang (Karai) provide good support. The key casting, however, lies in the actors who voice the turtles. Fortunately, though I've never heard of any of these guys, they come near perfect in how Leo, Mikey, Donatello, and especially Raphael should sound.Despite the inferior storytelling, this gets 4 stars from me, on the strength of how great the film looks.

Whether it's depicting Mikey gleefully skateboarding down the sewer tunnels, Raphael's headlong plunge down several stories as he parallels a monster's fall, or the frenetic and well-executed fight scenes, the animation is a blissful treat.

653300,A26O0T192IBKY1,B00005JPMZ,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","Imagi Entertainment's first full-length CGI animated movie before the recent Astro Boy film was this sequal to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles live-action movie trilogy from the 90s. Despite what alot of people thought, the Critic included, this was not a followup to the 80s animated series, the 2000s animated series, or the abomination known as The Next Mutation.Taking place a few years after the third movie, the Turtles have gone estranged. Leonardo left to go on a training mission to Central America. April O'Neil is now into trading relics, and while in Central America tracks down Leo, and lets him know how the other brothers are doing. Donatello and Michaelangelo each have secret part-time jobs to make ends meet. Raphael is doubling as a masked vigilante called Nightwatcher. Leo decides to finally return to New York. While this is going on, the Foot Clan is being lead Karai in the wake of Shredder's apparent death who are now working for the rich CEO, Max Winters. Winters is really an immortal ex-warrior king who three millenia ago opened a door to another dimension that unleashed thirteen monsters into our world. Winters is now trying to collect the monsters who are converging on New York, supposedly because the portal is going to reopen, although it threatens to release an endless army of monsters too. To help him, Winters collects the statue-fied remains of his former war buddies, and brings them to life as living stone. After getting involved in a fight with the Foot's attempt to capture one of the monsters, Leo grows tired of Raphael's stubborness to listen to his orders. He later finds out about Raphael's superheroing, and they have it out in a fight that's been building for a long time now(ask anyone whose read the original comics!). Leo gets captured by the Winters' stoneboys who want to fake him out as the last of the monsters so that they can keep their immortality. Raph gets Splinter, April, Casey Jones, and the other Turtles to raid Winters' tower while they are opening the vortex. The stone soldiers betray Winters as the Turtles and the Foot team up to stop them. They conveniently manage to find the last monster and send it into the vortex with the others. The Foot leaves promising a possible sequal, and Winters then disappears into pixie dust, while the Turtles decide to continue their crimefighting careers.This was a good upgrade from the live-action movies, and most of the other adaptions of the comic, but it still carried the storyline from the original movies pretty well. The animation is most impressive, and the backgrounds and character designs are very articulate. I thought the movie was a great extension of the Turtles mythos, even though it might be a little unappealing to non-shellheads",3,Turtles return,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,2764,"['Imagi', 'Entertainment', 'first', 'full-length', 'CGI', 'animated', 'movie', 'recent', 'Astro', 'Boy', 'film', 'was', 'sequal', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'live-action', 'movie', 'trilogy', '90s', 'what', 'alot', 'people', 'thought', 'Critic', 'included', 'was', 'not', 'followup', '80s', 'animated', 'series', '2000s', 'animated', 'series', 'abomination', 'known', 'Next', 'Mutation.Taking', 'place', 'few', 'years', 'third', 'movie', 'Turtles', 'have', 'gone', 'estranged', 'Leonardo', 'left', 'go', 'training', 'mission', 'Central', 'America', 'April', ""O'Neil"", 'now', 'trading', 'relics', 'Central', 'America', 'down', 'Leo', 'know', 'how', 'other', 'brothers', 'are', 'doing', 'Donatello', 'Michaelangelo', 'have', 'secret', 'part-time', 'jobs', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Raphael', 'doubling', 'masked', 'vigilante', 'called', 'Nightwatcher', 'Leo', 'finally', 'return', 'New', 'York', 'going', 'Foot', 'Clan', 'being', 'lead', 'Karai', 'wake', 'Shredder', 'apparent', 'death', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'working', 'rich', 'CEO', 'Max', 'Winters', 'Winters', 'really', 'immortal', 'ex-warrior', 'king', 'who', 'three', 'millenia', 'ago', 'opened', 'door', 'dimension', 'unleashed', 'thirteen', 'monsters', 'world', 'Winters', 'now', 'trying', 'collect', 'monsters', 'who', 'are', 'converging', 'New', 'York', 'supposedly', 'portal', 'going', 'reopen', 'release', 'endless', 'army', 'monsters', 'too', 'help', 'Winters', 'statue-fied', 'remains', 'former', 'war', 'buddies', 'life', 'living', 'stone', 'getting', 'involved', 'fight', 'Foot', 'attempt', 'capture', 'one', 'monsters', 'Leo', 'tired', 'Raphael', 'stubborness', 'listen', 'orders', 'later', 'out', 'Raphael', 'superheroing', 'have', 'out', 'fight', 'been', 'building', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'ask', 'anyone', 'read', 'original', 'comics', 'Leo', 'captured', 'Winters', 'stoneboys', 'who', 'want', 'fake', 'out', 'last', 'monsters', 'can', 'keep', 'immortality', 'Raph', 'Splinter', 'April', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'other', 'Turtles', 'raid', 'Winters', 'tower', 'are', 'opening', 'vortex', 'stone', 'soldiers', 'betray', 'Winters', 'Turtles', 'Foot', 'team', 'up', 'stop', 'conveniently', 'manage', 'find', 'last', 'monster', 'send', 'vortex', 'others', 'Foot', 'promising', 'possible', 'sequal', 'Winters', 'then', 'pixie', 'dust', 'Turtles', 'decide', 'continue', 'crimefighting', 'careers.This', 'was', 'good', 'upgrade', 'live-action', 'movies', 'most', 'other', 'adaptions', 'comic', 'still', 'carried', 'storyline', 'original', 'movies', 'pretty', 'well', 'animation', 'most', 'impressive', 'backgrounds', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'very', 'articulate', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'extension', 'Turtles', 'mythos', 'even', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'unappealing', 'non-shellheads']",N/A

653302,A1Z3O2SODQ1NZ1,B00005JPMZ,"Jason ""&#51228;&#51060;&#49832;""","[2, 2]","When I was a kid I was a huge fan of the Turtles watched the live action movies over and over.  But of late pretty much any movie that I liked as a kid is being remade or re-mastered and destroyed in the process.  This new TMNT is one of the first that feels like its being made by a fan.  Written and directed by Kevin Munroe, which shows with the story and action flowing together in most cases seamlessly.The story of the brothers is strong, Leonardo and Raphael hate and love for each other comes off strong leading up to their epic fight.  The rest of the Turtles aren't explored so in deathly but knowing that it's a series and that there will be more, it gives me hope for the writer to explore Donatello and Michelangelo giving them something more then just jokes on their own creation.  With Michelangelo lying on the couch talking while he sleeps, saying ""dude, dude, dude..."" and Donatello working Help lines for computers.  Though I find this funny and well written I wish it would go further into their story but I'll wait and hope it comes to that in the next installment of the TMNT.And it comes to the voice action, I found that the Turtles are done with respect, as well as giving these lifeless CGI models life. Even April and Casey done by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Evans, is done well.  The character that is lost with the voice is splinter (Mako), Mako also does the uncle in Avatar The Last Air Bender and is superb, having the ability to sound spacey but on point at all times.  The only problem is that is not the character of Splinter and when he is demanded to be serious, his voice comes off stale.  Leaving me wanting any scene that Splinter's in to end.Then it comes to the design, I found that at first I was worried not the biggest fan of CGI and a traditional animator myself.  But I found the CGI to be nice stylized with traditional animation technique giving the characters a fluid flow. The Turtles are skinny but seem to make sense to their bodies. But I have to say splinter again look horrible, like a rat put through a washing machine with a Asian looking cloth placed over him.  Along with splinter there are the human, which as skinny, looking as if you punched them in the face they would snap in half with the b bottom half still standing.And the thing that made me excited about it being animated was that the Turtles could actually use their weapons, because though the live action movies are amazing they lack one thing and that's a great weapon fight scene. It's just to hard in the suits, but this movie has them and has them strong, with Leo and Raph about to kill each other.All and all I'm glad that it wasn't just another live action take off, but still gave the character depth.  Their anger and strength come through them as they prepare to fight.  I'm just left disappointed because Splinter isn't the father figure he was in the live action films, he's more of the distant teacher that just shows up.I would recommend this film to any fan and any kid. And to those adults that can go to it as a film that's meant to entertain. 4 stars.",4,The only movie to make me care about Leonardo,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,3098,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Turtles', 'watched', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'late', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'liked', 'kid', 'being', 'remade', 're-mastered', 'destroyed', 'process', 'new', 'TMNT', 'one', 'first', 'being', 'made', 'fan', 'Written', 'directed', 'Kevin', 'Munroe', 'story', 'action', 'flowing', 'together', 'most', 'cases', 'seamlessly.The', 'story', 'brothers', 'strong', 'Leonardo', 'Raphael', 'hate', 'love', 'other', 'strong', 'leading', 'up', 'epic', 'fight', 'rest', 'Turtles', 'are', ""n't"", 'explored', 'so', 'deathly', 'knowing', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'hope', 'writer', 'explore', 'Donatello', 'Michelangelo', 'giving', 'something', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'jokes', 'own', 'creation', 'Michelangelo', 'lying', 'couch', 'talking', 'saying', 'dude', 'dude', 'dude', 'Donatello', 'working', 'Help', 'lines', 'computers', 'find', 'funny', 'well', 'written', 'wish', 'would', 'go', 'further', 'story', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'hope', 'next', 'installment', 'TMNT.And', 'voice', 'action', 'found', 'Turtles', 'are', 'done', 'respect', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'lifeless', 'CGI', 'models', 'life', 'Even', 'April', 'Casey', 'done', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'done', 'well', 'character', 'lost', 'voice', 'splinter', 'Mako', 'Mako', 'also', 'uncle', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Air', 'Bender', 'superb', 'having', 'ability', 'sound', 'spacey', 'point', 'times', 'only', 'problem', 'not', 'character', 'Splinter', 'when', 'demanded', 'be', 'serious', 'voice', 'off', 'stale', 'Leaving', 'wanting', 'scene', 'Splinter', 'end.Then', 'design', 'found', 'first', 'was', 'worried', 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'CGI', 'traditional', 'animator', 'found', 'CGI', 'be', 'nice', 'stylized', 'traditional', 'animation', 'technique', 'giving', 'characters', 'fluid', 'flow', 'Turtles', 'are', 'skinny', 'seem', 'make', 'sense', 'bodies', 'have', 'say', 'splinter', 'again', 'look', 'horrible', 'rat', 'put', 'washing', 'machine', 'Asian', 'looking', 'cloth', 'placed', 'splinter', 'are', 'human', 'skinny', 'looking', 'punched', 'face', 'would', 'snap', 'half', 'b', 'bottom', 'half', 'still', 'thing', 'made', 'excited', 'being', 'animated', 'was', 'Turtles', 'could', 'actually', 'use', 'weapons', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'amazing', 'lack', 'one', 'thing', 'great', 'weapon', 'fight', 'scene', 'just', 'hard', 'suits', 'movie', 'strong', 'Leo', 'Raph', 'kill', 'other.All', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'live', 'action', 'take', 'off', 'still', 'gave', 'character', 'depth', 'anger', 'strength', 'come', 'prepare', 'fight', ""'m"", 'just', 'left', 'disappointed', 'Splinter', ""n't"", 'father', 'figure', 'was', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'more', 'distant', 'teacher', 'just', 'up.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'fan', 'kid', 'adults', 'can', 'go', 'film', 'meant', 'entertain', '4', 'stars']",N/A

653304,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JPMZ,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 6]","I was one of the many that grew up watching Teenage mutant ninja turtles and got caught up in the whole TMNT phenomenon back in the late 80s and the early 90s. That being said, the craze escalated when the guys in green migrated to the big screen and spanned over 2 sequels, which to my opinion didn't match up the level of polish the first one was.Yes, my family and I watched the new TMNT movie and I was, once again, one of the few or many that wasn't keen about the whole CGI transition and it just looked too kiddie cartoon to me. However, being a fan I am, I went to see the movie anyways because I always have a soft spot for my green heroes. The first live action movie still has a lot of charm to it, although it is almost 2 decades old, and it is really close to the comic book origins. I still, up to this day, have goose bumps while watching it and the one liners still makes me laugh. I realized now why the first one is such classic and the rest just fall flat - the sequels were toned down a bit and they weren't as gritty and mature as the first one was.Now we are with TMNT - a rival attempt to the franchise- now let me say I totally enjoyed this movie and I think the transition from live to CGI was best suited for the following reasons: 1. It is easier for the viewer to be caught up in the illusion as opposed to the live actions films because we knew that the turtles were fake - guys in rubbery suits...2. We finally grasp the sense of the turtles being ninjas - in the old films their movements were limited because of the obvious, but here they're more agile and realistic in terms of fighting.3. Because it is CGI the imagination, scenery, fights can go wild because the sky is the limit with CG as opposed to live action..I can go on and on, but the movie just fit right with this style of filming. I really enjoyed the interaction with the turtles - Leo character fits right as I remembered him to be; Raf seems complex and different from the bunch, which is true the comics; Donnie, although not much character development, seems to be the same old Don as I remembered him to be; and then there is Mikey....I love this guy as well as Master Splinter even though he look likes Chester Cheetah (from the Cheetos commercials).

But I had a lot of doubts in me because I'm not too crazy over the ""NEW"" cartoon series and I knew this was based on the new series. The reasons I don't like the new series is because of it's comic book art style [and the turtles have no pupils] and there's no Krang, Bebop, or Rocksteady. And I'm sad to say that this TMNT movie is exactly what I was affraid it would be...a letdown!Sure, the CG animation looks great and all [April O'Neil never looked better] but I would have greatly preferred another live action movie. This movie made me feel like I missed something, almost like there was another movie before this one and I missed it. Because in this movie, Shredder is supposedly dead...which was a great disappointment to me. There's a new bad guy in this movie which I believe made this movie boring! Well, that AND the story. And since when does April O'Neil know any kind of martial arts? Since I don't watch the NEW series, I don't know! I guess all I can do is hope that eventually the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles gets back to it's original greatness again!

This time round its computer generated, which adds substantially to the emotional range of the characters. The art directors hedged their bets by stylizing the human designs rather than the risky attempt to do any ultra-realistic representation. But, the turtles are animated to gorgeous mutant perfection, as you'd expect. This allows for the terrific dynamic between the brothers, especially the expressiveness necessary to convey some of the more charged moments between Leonardo, just returned from South American soul-searching and brother Raphael chafing at the need to follow any orders. The siblings deal with these issues in a way that none of the other incarnations of character have taken on, the series has grown up with it's audience, those of us who were fans of the original books, movies and TV shows. It will still appeal to its new generation of Turtle fans, but it is surely the most clever and best written of any non-comic version. While the film still combines elements of the currently running comic book series with the original film series and the currently running Saturday morning fare. Don't worry, it combines the best elements...really. Throw-backs include some sewer skatin', Splinter joinin' the fray and a ""I love bein' a turtle"" closer. Not to mention a timely soundtrack, like a particularly effective use of a cover of ""Black Betty"" during Raphael's  scuffle with the Jersey Devil appropriately enough in Kevin Smith's kitchen.The voice talent is particularly notable in TMNT: Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar is an excellent April, Patrick Stewart is a perfect mult-millenium-aged warrior-king, the venerable Mako (Aku of SAMURAI JACK & that wizard in CONAN) is a natural for Master Splinter,  cameos from Kevin Smith a.k.a Silent Bob (as a cook), Laurence Fishburne of the Matrix narrates,  also, Ziyi Zhang, Chris Evans (as Casey Jones) and others.The story is pretty good, if maybe complex: The Turtles have gone their separate ways, Leo off to become a better leader, Raphael embarks on a solo vigilante career in the absence of a team, Mikey does kid's parties as a Turtle-headed Cowabunga Carl, while Donny, of course, is a phone-bound tech-support. No back-story or origin of the turtles is needed nor is it supplied, we are thrown right in with a Lord of the Rings style set-up of a warrior who opens a gateway to immortality, but in doing so, releases 13 monsters upon the world and when our story begins in the present, 3000 years later, the time has come to make things right, with the help of the recently reunited Turtles, the FOOT Clan (lead by Korai, the Shredder's adopted daughter and sole heir, although this isn't referenced in the film) and some living stone warriors from the old days. The team ultimately work out their interpersonal issues and team-up for the epic climax including Casey & April.Great, gorgeous and clever "" I do hope there's more of them...""",5,"Both old & new school....Great, gorgeous & clever ...""

He's been sent there by Master Splinter (Mako) to learn how to be a better leader to his brothers.  The training didn't go well, and Leo stayed.But in his absence, his brothers have lost their way.  Michelangelo (Mikey Kelly) dons a costume and hires himself out for entertainment as kid's birthday parties.  Donatello (Mitchelle Witfield) works as a computer helpline operator.  Only Raphael (Nolan North) still fights crime, taking to the streets at night as a vigilante.The turtle's human friend April (Sarah Michelle Gellar) finds Leo while on an antiques expedition.  When she tells him what his brothers are up to, he decides to return to New York, where he is greeted warmly by all but Raphael.He's returned just in time, however.  Something evil is happening in New York City.  Weird creatures are on the loose and even stranger creatures are capturing them.  Can the turtles pull together to find the answers and defend their city?I wasn't a fan of the turtles going into the movie, but got talked into going to see it by some friends.  Even so, I found this movie fairly predictable.  Now that's not necessarily a bad thing in my book.  There are some movies I absolutely love that were predictable.My bigger problem came with Leo and Raphael's fight.  I wanted to see the turtles working together, something they really don't spend much time doing.  In fact, this storyline dominates so much of the film, the villain's story seemed more like a badly tacked on sub-plot instead of the main focus.Not that the villain wasn't entertaining.  I got caught up in wondering how the turtles would defeat him.  I just wish it had been more prominently featured.The computer animation is quite interesting.  It's part realistic, part comic book.  There were shots that looked very real, including some during a rain storm.  Other times, it looked like something directly out of a comic book.I don't know how true fans will feel about the movie.  I tried to give it a far chance, but it really didn't entertain me like I hoped it would.",3,Crime Fighting Heroes in Search of a Good Plot,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,2114,"['Leonardo', 'voiced', 'James', 'Arnold', 'Taylor', 'been', 'studying', 'South', 'America', 'been', 'sent', 'Master', 'Splinter', 'Mako', 'learn', 'how', 'be', 'better', 'leader', 'brothers', 'training', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'Leo', 'stayed.But', 'absence', 'brothers', 'have', 'lost', 'way', 'Michelangelo', 'Mikey', 'Kelly', 'costume', 'out', 'entertainment', 'kid', 'birthday', 'parties', 'Donatello', 'Mitchelle', 'Witfield', 'computer', 'helpline', 'operator', 'Only', 'Raphael', 'Nolan', 'North', 'still', 'fights', 'crime', 'taking', 'streets', 'night', 'vigilante.The', 'turtle', 'human', 'friend', 'April', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Leo', 'antiques', 'expedition', 'When', 'what', 'brothers', 'are', 'up', 'return', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'greeted', 'warmly', 'Raphael.He', 'returned', 'just', 'time', 'however', 'Something', 'evil', 'happening', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Weird', 'creatures', 'are', 'loose', 'even', 'stranger', 'creatures', 'are', 'capturing', 'Can', 'turtles', 'pull', 'together', 'find', 'answers', 'defend', 'city', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'turtles', 'going', 'movie', 'got', 'talked', 'going', 'see', 'friends', 'Even', 'so', 'found', 'movie', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'Now', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'book', 'are', 'movies', 'absolutely', 'love', 'were', 'predictable.My', 'bigger', 'problem', 'came', 'Leo', 'Raphael', 'fight', 'wanted', 'see', 'turtles', 'working', 'together', 'something', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'doing', 'fact', 'storyline', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'villain', 'story', 'seemed', 'more', 'badly', 'tacked', 'sub-plot', 'instead', 'main', 'focus.Not', 'villain', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'wondering', 'how', 'turtles', 'would', 'defeat', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'prominently', 'featured.The', 'computer', 'animation', 'quite', 'interesting', 'part', 'realistic', 'part', 'comic', 'book', 'were', 'shots', 'looked', 'very', 'real', 'including', 'rain', 'storm', 'Other', 'times', 'looked', 'something', 'directly', 'comic', 'book.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'true', 'fans', 'will', 'feel', 'movie', 'tried', 'give', 'far', 'chance', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'entertain', 'hoped', 'would']",N/A

Or something yellow anyway? After much thought, I realised the only reason I had her was because my neighbours grandsons had the rest of the figurines, and I wanted to 'play' with them. Why they put up with me, I have no idea, I was a lonely little girl, who didn't have any friends, and they were probably teenagers at the time.I have no recollection of watching the turtles I was young. I probably did at some point, but I don't think I watched it avidly, or anything like that. In fact, in a recent question & answer session (before watching this of course!) I could only name two of the turtles - Leonardo & Raphael. I couldn't even remember Splinter!But enough of my rambling, my opinion on the film was yes it was good, considering I had no idea what was going on a lot of the time. I thought the effects were excellent, and what made the film a lot different from other animation movies, I couldn't place the 'celebrity' voices in it. Which makes a change. (Just in case you were curious, some of them included Patrick Stewart, Lawrence Fishburne, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Chris Evans.)The turtles were smart - I don't have a favourite, and I don't think I could tell you right now which one was which (possibly!), they were funny, and they each had their own special weapons. I think if I'm thinking of the correct one, I liked Raphael (or Leonardo), cos they had those two knives.Are there a lot of hardcore disappointed fans out there? If there is, you're way too hardcore. Hey, according to someone special, my figurine of April was way wrong, if you go by the comics. But there's a lot of different fans out there - you've got fans of the comics, fans of the original TV shows, etc, who do you disappoint first? This must be a very difficult movie if they'd even brought that into consideration. I wouldn't want a bunch of die hard fans on my case if I was the director. But then he's probably just after the paycheck.I can't really say I'm going to become a die hard fan of the Turtles anytime soon. It was a perfectly good animation movie, considering I was slightly wary of it to begin with, and this is the kinda film that needs to be respected, rather than the Shreks of the film world these days. Make more of these, maybe you'll get a new fan. Or maybe not!

653327,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B00005JPMZ,Mel Odom,"[6, 7]","The Turtles have been around in one incarnation or another for more than a generation now.  They started out as a black-and-white comic by Eastman and Laird, who have gone on to other things but have never grown beyond this one HUGE splash they made in comics and kids cartoons.The original Turtles weren't for kids.  The action in the comics was gritty and bloody.  They originally didn't sell well.  In their first incarnation, they were like a parody of the white-hot X-Men at the time.Then someone out in television production land looked at the idea and thought the Turtles would be an excellent addition to the kids market that the X-Men cartoons had opened up.  And we soon had Turtles everywhere.  Cartoons, comics, movies, and action figures soon blossomed everywhere.Now we have TMNT, which is most likely the relaunch of the movie franchise.  Thankfully we're not treated to a rehash of Turtle history and the origin story.  Unless you've been living in some far-off shell, you know the story of the four turtles and the rat that were exposed to radioactive slime and became Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo, Raphael, and Master Splinter.  April O'Neil and Casey Jones are also up to bat in this one (sorry, I couldn't resist).The plot centers around a billionaire CEO named Max Winters who's been alive for 3000 years thanks to a spell that introduced 13 monsters into the world.  The planets only line up in a certain way every 3000 years to provide the energy to open a doorway to another world (you'd think they'd find a better power source!).  Winters also had four generals who served him that were turned to stone.  They've recently returned to life and are now looking for the 13 monsters to power up the sorcerous spell again.  Mix in the Foot Clan who are working for Winters and you've got a return to greatness.The characterizations for the Turtles, Splinter, April O'Neil (voiced by Sarah Michelle Geller), and Casey Jones are spot-on.  April comes across a little to Tomb Raiderish for me, but it works overall.However, Leonardo has been gone from the group for the last year and doesn't really want to return.  When he does, it's just in time and there's a world to save and a family to reclaim.TMNT is beautifully rendered in computer generated artwork.  Although it does admittedly look like a cartoon and you're never really pulled into the this-is-real mindset even the three live-action movies of the 1980s achieved to a somewhat limited dgeree, the world is big and vibrant.  The musical score compliments the action and the moods really well.  The fight between Raphael and one of the demons to the rollicking licks of ""Black Betty"" have to be seen to be believed.My nine-year-old was in heaven.  There were plenty of funny bits, actions as well as one-liners, that kept him in stitches.  Even though some of the movie is predicatable for the adult mind, I still had a blast and found myself chuckling along with my kid.  Even my 17-year-old son and 21-year-old daughter, who I thought would never want to see this movie, had a great time when they decided to join us.The martial arts moves, the mad dashes across the rooftops, and the larger-than-life creatures in combat on the screen looked terrific.  You're not going to get this kind of experience in live-action, and the cartoons simply don't have this kind of budget for CGI.The movie treks along familiar themes and doesn't really go anywhere new, but it is a fantastic treatment of material that has become part of a generation's heritage.

I wondered how this would turn out, so I took my niece to see it who I don't think thought it was all that great either.The graphics looked good, after I got past how big the Turtles hands looked and got used to the look.... but from my understanding this movie was supposed to go back to the roots of the comics where it was a much darker feel to it... but nope, it isn't even a new start as I thought it might... it's pretty much TMNT 4! Shredder is mentioned for a brief second at the beginning of the film, but also later hinted at for a sequel.PLOT: Leonardo has left the Turtles to go to South America somewhere to further his training or something, so the other 3 Turtles are pretty much out of work and bored with there lives... Donatello is an IT consultant, Mikey is dressing up as a Big turtle clown for parties and Raph has become a secret avenger by night in a shredder kind of outfit as a vigilante that he doesn't let the other turtles know about.April O'Neil (looked too anomie imo)find's Leonardo in South America helping out a village as an unseen protector kind of thing but soon finds his way going home to New York to take lead of the brothers again while still feuding with Raph over leadership.Also, 3000 years ago something happened that left this guy immortal and turned his generals into stone, so they, with the help of the foot in present day are looking for 13 monsters so they are not immortal anymore... i dunno what it was all about really, it was kind of confusing... but it was kinda like the end plot to 13 ghosts.Casey Jones also returns, but if kind of, i dunno, just not the right look for him or speech, both him and April just didn't feel right, i dunno, maybe you can get used to it, but they just looked too out of place.The plot as I said had a bit of confusion, plus, it didn't have the shell kicking it needed or smartness to it, it was all kind of too fast paces and needed a better ending.But don't get me wrong, thats just what i thought, and i'm not saying its a bad movie, im just saying the original fans might find it a bit out of place in certain parts.oh well, see yas at the sequel.",3,Nothing Special,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,2295,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', '80', 'TMNT', 'cartoon', 'then', 'movies', 'not', 'fan', 'new', 'TMNT', 'TMNT', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'big', 'screen', '3D', 'CGI', 'wondered', 'how', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'took', 'niece', 'see', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'either.The', 'graphics', 'looked', 'good', 'got', 'past', 'how', 'big', 'Turtles', 'hands', 'looked', 'got', 'used', 'look', 'understanding', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'go', 'back', 'roots', 'comics', 'where', 'was', 'much', 'darker', 'feel', 'nope', ""n't"", 'even', 'new', 'start', 'thought', 'might', 'pretty', 'much', 'TMNT', '4', 'Shredder', 'mentioned', 'brief', 'second', 'beginning', 'film', 'also', 'later', 'hinted', 'sequel.PLOT', 'Leonardo', 'left', 'Turtles', 'go', 'South', 'America', 'somewhere', 'further', 'training', 'something', 'other', '3', 'Turtles', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'work', 'bored', 'lives', 'Donatello', 'IT', 'consultant', 'Mikey', 'dressing', 'up', 'Big', 'turtle', 'clown', 'parties', 'Raph', 'become', 'secret', 'avenger', 'night', 'shredder', 'kind', 'outfit', 'vigilante', ""n't"", 'let', 'other', 'turtles', 'know', 'about.April', ""O'Neil"", 'looked', 'too', 'anomie', 'imo', 'find', 'Leonardo', 'South', 'America', 'helping', 'out', 'village', 'unseen', 'protector', 'kind', 'thing', 'soon', 'way', 'going', 'home', 'New', 'York', 'take', 'lead', 'brothers', 'again', 'still', 'feuding', 'Raph', 'leadership.Also', '3000', 'years', 'something', 'happened', 'left', 'guy', 'immortal', 'turned', 'generals', 'stone', 'help', 'foot', 'present', 'day', 'are', 'looking', '13', 'monsters', 'are', 'not', 'immortal', 'anymore', 'i', 'dunno', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'was', 'kind', 'confusing', 'was', 'kinda', 'end', 'plot', '13', 'ghosts.Casey', 'Jones', 'also', 'kind', 'i', 'dunno', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'look', 'speech', 'April', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'i', 'dunno', 'maybe', 'can', 'get', 'used', 'just', 'looked', 'too', 'place.The', 'plot', 'said', 'had', 'bit', 'confusion', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'shell', 'kicking', 'needed', 'smartness', 'was', 'kind', 'too', 'fast', 'paces', 'needed', 'better', 'ending.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'thats', 'just', 'what', 'i', 'thought', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'movie', 'im', 'just', 'saying', 'original', 'fans', 'might', 'find', 'bit', 'place', 'certain', 'parts.oh', 'well', 'see', 'yas', 'sequel']",N/A

653333,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00005JPMZ,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[4, 5]","Let's get something clear: I love the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, no matter what form they take, from TV shows to comics, but the movies have thus far always been my favorite medium. It takes some serious goofing up on a director's part to make me cast anything less than a fawning eye on my reptilian heroes...but in this case, first-time director Kevin Munroe has made me leave the theatre feeling disappointed, even though I had just been blasted by 87 minutes of my favorite sewer-dwelling ninjas. My god, what went wrong? - the animation was top-notch, the cast featured big names like Sarah Michelle Gellar (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") and Mako Iwamatsu (""Seven Years in Tibet""), and the film had a budget that topped that of all three previous movies. What could have possibly sullied the greatest chance to re-introduce the Turtles to a new generation?In ""TMNT"", the Turtles are a divided clan: with Leonardo (James Taylor, ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"") off honing his skills in Central America, Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield, ""W.I.T.C.H."") and Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) have pursued dead-end jobs in the civillian sector while Raphael (Nolan North) has turned to fighting crime on his own. Yet, when an ancient and dangerous power summoned by a powerful businessman (Patrick Stewart, ""X-Men"") threatens to be turned upon the city, the Turtles must come together in an effort to save the world....but with personal tensions running high between Leo and Raph, will they be able to remain a team?My first grief is with the story itself: while it'll easily appeal to younger kids and fans of the current TV series, don't the Turtles have enough time in their once-a-week primetime slot to relieve the need for magic and other supernatural elements as plot points? I mean, I know that arguing realism where the Turtles are concerned is a bit of a paradox, but I like to think that the previous three movies held a semi-realism and sophistication that served as a pleasant departure from the buffoonery of the TV shows; I like giant monsters, ancient prophecies, and stone statues coming to life as much as the next guy, but could writer/director Munroe really not come up with anything better than recycled serial fodder for his first feature-length movie?Also, I jumped for joy when I realized that most of the story's arc revolved around Raph and Leo...but my face fell when I realized that it came at the expense of Donny and Mike. While I was pleased by how the movie built on their rivalry (the showdown in the rain is the absolute best confrontation between the two, ever), I saw so little of their other two brothers that I occassionally forgot they existed; other than seeing both at the beginning of the movie and seeing Mike take a tumble on his skateboard, their input to the movie is extremely limited. This carries over into the fight scenes, where we see a few seconds' worth of Don wielding his bo staff and virtually nothing of Mikey swinging his nunchukas while Raph and Leo lead the charge. Shoot, even April (Gellar) gets better fight scenes!Smaller, less signifigant nitpicks include the film's choice of villain (who has no previous connection to the franchise) and the character design, which - apart from the Turtles and other non-human characters - looks like it was taken from ""The Incredibles"", with Max Winters hardly looking threatening as a human charicature and Casey Jones (Chris Evans, ""Fantastic 4"") sporting a chin from hell.On the good side, the movie really is a good example of fantastic CG animation, the voice-casting is fine, the action scenes are exciting (the brawl in the skyscraper takes the cake), and a decent amount of humor reminds me why I liked these guys in the first place. The Leo/Raph wound is re-opened and examined to its most personal level. Small scenes like Mikey sewer-skating and Raph's encounter with the pint-sized (albeit insanely destructive) monster build both character and charm, and make a point that the filmmakers are not entirely without an eye for detail.Alas, there's nothing good enough here to keep my attention beyond a second viewing that merely confirmed my belief in the film's inadequacy as an addition to the pre-existing trilogy. While any TMNT is better than no TMNT, I can honestly say that this latest incarnation has topped TMNT3 for disappointment...but even that one had a little bit for everybody, while the current offering panders to kids and strict CGI-lovers but delivers nothing to the more mature fans of the Turtles.Maybe next time, Warner Bros. will think twice before letting a first-time director at the helm of one of the century's biggest franchises...but until then, we're stuck with this.",2,De-Shelled,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,4695,"['Let', 'get', 'something', 'clear', 'love', 'Teenage',

653334,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B00005JPMZ,Mike Zimmerman,"[3, 4]","After the defeat of nemesis Shredder, the Turtles have split up. Leader Leonardo (James Arnold Kelly) now resides in South America by orders of Master Splinter (Mako), Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) is tech help, Michaelangelo (Mikey Kelly) entertains youngsters as Cowabunga Carl, and Raphael (Nolan North) defends New York under the identity of Nightwalker. Struggling to keep them together, their rat sensei, Master Splinter (Mako), becomes worried when strange things begin to brew in New York City. Tech-industrialist Max Winters (Patrick Stewart) is raising up an army of ancient, 3,000-year-old monsters to take over New York. The Turtles are now needed more than ever, and with a little pep-talk from Casey Jones (Chris Evans) and April O'Neil (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the Turtles must put any beef behind them and focus on more pressing matters.With comic books being converted into movies by the dozen, feel free to add ""TMNT"" to the list. That's right, the heroes in a half shell have come back after a 14 year absence, thanks to Kevin Monroe, director of some video game called ""Freaky Flyers"", who ALMOST gets it right.In this installment, Munroe ditches the light tone of the live-action films and goes for a grittier tone a la ""Batman Begins"". This change of pace is one of this movie's many strengths, but also its many weakness. The good is that Munroe adds a subplot that has Leonardo and Raphael at each others throats. What could've been annoying fodder is actually compelling and powerful, thanks to James Arnold Taylor (""Drawn Together"" as the voice of Wooldor Sockbat) and Nolan North's (""Ultimate Avengers"" as Hank Pym/Giant Man) sharp line readings. And how can you go wrong with a scene where the two Turtles vent their emotions during heavy downpour? That scene is where we get to see Munroe's surprisingly sharp editing skills in action.Unfortunately, it's also the film's weakness. I applaud Munroe for sticking to the comic book origins, but he seems to be at a tug-of-war between scenes of conflict and scenes where Michaelangelo and Donatello - reduced to cameos - crack jokes. Anytime the latter happens, it doesn't have the correct effect to make us laugh. You can tell Munroe is trying to match the original movies' upbeat nature by throwing in driving rock-and-roll tunes in various scenes (such as Jet's ""Rip it Up"", Big Rock City's update on the Ram Jam classic ""Black Betty"", and more), yet it doesn't meld well when dealing with darker situations.Munroe has also added newcomers to the cast. Mako, who recently died this year, gives his last, and most memorable performance as Zen Master Splinter. Chris Evans delivers a funny performance as hockey-loving crimefighter Casey Jones. Patrick Stewart makes his villainous character believable without being overly loathsome. There's even a brief cameo by director Kevin Smith that gets some much needed laughs in a scene where Raphael battles a monster in the kitchen, and Smith's chef character believes that he's being robbed. Finally, Larry Fishburne reads the opening narration with total conviction. All actors benefit.The only weak spot in the cast, which is a shock to me, is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Annoying squeaky voice aside, Gellar is another star whose gifted comic timing (see her 2002 episode of ""Saturday Night Live"") isn't used to full potential. Rather, she seems to be stepping back into her days of being on ""Buffy: The Vampire Slaye""r, where her take on April O'Neil has mastered martial arts. In the movie adaptation of ""Scooby Doo"", Sarah was able to take this subplot and be funny at the same time. In ""TMNT"", it's taken too seriously, robbing her chances to take advantage of the material. And when she's in a scene of comedy, it feels awkward.All that aside. ""TMNT"" is an entertaining film, and a rebirth of a franchise that may see the light of day again considering how the movie ends. Let's just hope Munroe can get the franchise back to its light-hearted spoof agenda if that ever happens.",3,"""Man, I love being a turtle!""",1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,4005,"['defeat', 'nemesis', 'Shredder', 'Turtles', 'have', 'split', 'up', 'Leader', 'Leonardo', 'James', 'Arnold', 'Kelly', 'now', 'South', 'America', 'orders', 'Master', 'Splinter', 'Mako', 'Donatello', 'Mitchell', 'Whitfield', 'tech', 'help', 'Michaelangelo', 'Mikey', 'Kelly', 'youngsters', 'Cowabunga', 'Carl', 'Raphael', 'Nolan', 'North', 'New', 'York', 'identity', 'Nightwalker', 'Struggling', 'keep', 'together', 'rat', 'sensei', 'Master', 'Splinter', 'Mako', 'becomes', 'worried', 'when', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'brew', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Tech-industrialist', 'Max', 'Winters', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'raising', 'up', 'army', 'ancient', '3,000-year-old', 'monsters', 'take', 'over', 'New', 'York', 'Turtles', 'are', 'now', 'needed', 'more', 'ever', 'little', 'pep-talk', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'April', ""O'Neil"", 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Turtles', 'must', 'put', 'beef', 'focus', 'more', 'pressing', 'matters.With', 'comic', 'books', 'being', 'converted', 'movies', 'dozen', 'feel', 'free', 'add', 'TMNT', 'list', 'right', 'heroes', 'half', 'shell', 'have', 'come', 'back', '14', 'year', 'absence', 'thanks', 'Kevin', 'Monroe', 'director', 'video', 'game', 'called', 'Freaky', 'Flyers', 'who', 'ALMOST', 'right.In', 'installment', 'Munroe', 'light', 'tone', 'live-action', 'films', 'grittier', 'tone', 'la', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'change', 'pace', 'one', 'movie', 'many', 'strengths', 'also', 'many', 'weakness', 'good', 'Munroe', 'subplot', 'Leonardo', 'Raphael', 'others', 'throats', 'What', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'annoying', 'fodder', 'actually', 'compelling', 'powerful', 'thanks', 'James', 'Arnold', 'Taylor', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'voice', 'Wooldor', 'Sockbat', 'Nolan', 'North', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'Hank', 'Pym/Giant', 'Man', 'sharp', 'line', 'readings', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'Turtles', 'vent', 'emotions', 'heavy', 'downpour', 'scene', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'Munroe', 'surprisingly', 'sharp', 'editing', 'skills', 'action.Unfortunately', 'also', 'film', 'weakness', 'applaud', 'Munroe', 'sticking', 'comic', 'book', 'origins', 'be', 'tug-of-war', 'scenes', 'conflict', 'scenes', 'where', 'Michaelangelo', 'Donatello', 'reduced', 'cameos', 'crack', 'jokes', 'Anytime', 'latter', 'happens', ""n't"", 'have', 'correct', 'effect', 'make', 'can', 'tell', 'Munroe', 'trying', 'match', 'original', 'movies', 'upbeat', 'nature', 'throwing', 'driving', 'rock-and-roll', 'tunes', 'various', 'scenes', 'such', 'Jet', 'Rip', 'Up', 'Big', 'Rock', 'City', 'update', 'Ram', 'Jam', 'classic', 'Black', 'Betty', 'more', 'yet', ""n't"", 'meld', 'well', 'when', 'dealing', 'darker', 'situations.Munroe', 'also', 'added', 'newcomers', 'cast', 'Mako', 'who', 'recently', 'died', 'year', 'last', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Zen', 'Master', 'Splinter', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'funny', 'performance', 'hockey-loving', 'crimefighter', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'villainous', 'character', 'believable', 'being', 'overly', 'loathsome', 'even', 'brief', 'cameo', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'much', 'needed', 'scene', 'where', 'Raphael', 'monster', 'kitchen', 'Smith', 'chef', 'character', 'being', 'robbed', 'Finally', 'Larry', 'Fishburne', 'opening', 'narration', 'total', 'conviction', 'actors', 'benefit.The', 'only', 'weak', 'spot', 'cast', 'shock', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Annoying', 'squeaky', 'voice', 'aside', 'Gellar', 'star', 'gifted', 'comic', 'timing', 'see', '2002', 'episode', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', ""n't"", 'used', 'full', 'potential', 'be', 'stepping', 'back', 'days', 'being', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slaye', 'r', 'where', 'take', 'April', ""O'Neil"", 'mastered', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Sarah', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'subplot', 'be', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'TMNT', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'robbing', 'chances', 'take', 'advantage', 'material', 'when', 'scene', 'comedy', 'aside', 'TMNT', 'entertaining', 'film', 'rebirth', 'franchise', 'may', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'again', 'considering', 'how', 'movie', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'Munroe', 'can', 'get', 'franchise', 'back', 'light-hearted', 'spoof', 'agenda', 'ever']",N/A

Leaving the cinema, my dad taught me the phrase, ""You couldn't pay me to do that again.""Two years late my friend Seth and I saw the second one. My reaction was one of ambivalence. What difference a year of high school makes. Two years after that I started watching the third one on TV. I barely made it in 15 minutes.Half a lifetime later, the Turtles are making a comeback, and I see why. This installment carries enough gravitas to appeal to all the old Turtle fans, and entertain the kids watching now.It begins in the middle of the story. The Turtles have recently defeated the Shredder, but the team has sundered. A morose Leonardo has travelled to Central America to learn to be a better leader. How exactly doing this would make him a better leader isn't explained. The others aren't doing much better, Donatello's stuck in tech-support world. Michaelangelo, always the party animal, is a children's party dummy. And Rapheal, the short fuse, has taken up vigilantism.Meanwhile, Captain Picard is gathering up his old army of immortal stone warriors and the 13 monsters he brought into the world 3,000 years earlier. He's got both April O'Neil and Casey Jones (man, was I glad to see him in this!), and the Foot Clan working for him.Great voice talent drove the otherwise hackneyed plot and its deus ex machina ending along.

The story is pretty basic and straightforward, but it definitely feels like they developed it with a companion video game in mind. Many scenes just feel like they were meant to be great levels on the video game based on the movie.If you can get past that, however, the action is actually done quite well.The one thing that is really missing here is the lightheartedness of the first films. Whether you loved or hated those films, they definitely had more humor than this rather dour version. (I personally loved the first two, but the third one suffered from much more than sub-par animatronics due to the fact that the Jim Henson Company wasn't interested in doing the third one.)Not to say that there is no room for a more brooding version of the turtles. It works, for instance, rather well for Raphael since he is by far the more broody of the bunch. Leonardo also does a fair amount of brooding himself, always wondering what more he could be doing as the leader, not feeling up to the job. However it does Michaelangelo and Donatello a disservice. Their strong point (as characters) is largely built around their playful, quippy, snarky attitudes in situations of great danger. They get a couple of quips out here, but they feel forced and there are not enough of them to really get a feel for their characters.On the whole, I enjoyed the movie well enough, but I would have definitely preferred more for the cinematic return of the Turtle clan.**Mild Mild Spoiler Alert**They hint at a possible sequel, and I do hope that they get it out. This movie was largely bogged down by the attempt to re-introduce the characters to the movie-going audience. (April as a ninja? C'mon.) A sequel, however, would not be thusly hindered.

After 14 years after the last movie was done, we finally get a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie starring our favorite reptiles.  The story picks up years later after the third movie, while Leonardo is training to be a better leader leaving the others back in New York waiting for his return.  While Mikey, Donnie and Raph have to find some way to keep busy while Leo is off on his training that Splinter had sent him on, though there seems to be a rough patch for them as they try to keep the turtle family together.  Eventually Leo, makes his way back to his brothers just in time to face their possible threat to their brotherhood, eventually they learn how to act as a family to overcome the possibilities.While this is the first `animated' movie in the turtles franchise, although this technology wasn't in full use back in the day of the live action movies.  Visually the turtles look good, as well as the other characters, but one thing is that some areas don't seem to look to be all that great, that may be due to not being a big budget to work with.  Although this movie does reminisce, some qualities of the previous movies while at the same time it seems to keep true to the original source which is that of the Turtles comics.  If there's anything I can say is that with this movie they were able to do things that they may not have been able to do if they would've made this a live action movie.  As for the extras, they're good but not excellent though it helps give an idea on what wanted to be done as well as knowing why some things were taken out.

This movie however, isn't what it could've been.What works: The visuals of the Turtles are spot-on, and in computer-generated form they're more athletic and acrobatic than ever. There's one particular showcase fight sequence in the rain that is gorgeous. The film also nails the family dynamic between the Turtles and Splinter, from friendships and brotherly rivalry to the father-son dynamics. It's a deeper approach than the animated TMNT shows have taken, and it works.What doesn't work: The plot of the movie, involving an immortal conqueror and 13 monsters, comes off as a bunch of sci-fi nonsense. The story clashes with the grittier, grounded tone the rest of the film wants to take, and it's disappointment for anyone looking for some classic TMNT/Foot Clan action (the Foot Clan sans Shredder does appear, but only in a supporting role). The narrative isn't particularly well told either, and there are certain obvious gaffs such as when April repeats the entire history already explained in the opening narrative. Other bits and pieces seem to have been cut for time, and Mikey and Don get somewhat shortchanged in the screen time department. Finally, the designs for April, Casey, and the rest of the human cast don't hold up to other modern computer animation - they animate stiffly and lack originality.This animated movie is better than the 2nd and 3rd live-action films, but is still a distant second to the original 1990 film that represents the TMNT at their best.

So of course I was intrigued yet skeptical about seeing them on the big screen again in more than a decade.  I was pleasantly surprised that they hadn't changed much.Good news for Raphael fans like me.  His character is focused on quite a lot, as he has now taken up crime fighting in disguise at night, against the wishes of their sensai Splinter the rat.  It gives him sort of a Batman/Wolverine quality that I liked.  Leonardo is also at the forefront of this movie as well, returning home to his family after training alone in the jungles of South America.  Donatello and Michaelangelo take a backseat to all this but still play their part and get in on plenty of the action.Casey Jones makes a grand return to the series and plays off Raphael and April the best.  Speaking of April, this is my favorite interpretation of her I've seen.  She's no longer the pesky, whiny reporter looking for ""a big scoop"" and getting into trouble in the process.  Instead she can take care of herself now and makes a welcome addition to the team.Splinter's voice was probably my least favorite aspect, but that's a minor complaint.  All the turtles were voiced by actors who obviously knew the characters and played them well.  CG animation is the perfect medium for this type of movie.  Definitely not realistic looking, but added to the cartoony nature of the idea of giant turtles.  The turtles definitely looked better than the humans.  I think the action sequences benefitted from that over the limitations of the live action movies.  Some of the ""camera"" angles were definitely well crafted during the battles especially.I enjoyed seeing the foot clan play a part in it as well.  Seeing them animated to fight they way they did I enjoyed a lot better than the live action foot.  These guys moved like ninjas.  Maybe just the anime style is what I liked about it.  I enjoyed the little details as well that they threw in there.  The broken canister of ooze on the shelf along with Shredder's helmet was a nice touch.Of course like any comic book movie, they set it up for a sequel.  We'll just have to wait and see if they can keep it up or even top this.  I just hope we can see Bebop and Rocksteady.  Perhaps even Krang.  I'm actually starting to get excited at the thought.

Critics are putting this one down rather harshly and yet films like Happy Feet got showered with golden rains of praise but in the end that golden rain was just piss. Quite frankly critics have lost any and all sensibility when it comes to which films they choose to unilaterally praise or completely trash.If you visit rottentomatoes.com TMNT is sitting pretty low on the tomatometer.  Reviews like that can worry any hardcore turtle fan but allow me to ease your fears.  TMNT brings back the look and style from the original Laird/Eastman comics.  The CG animation is sparkling marred only by the lackluster design of the human characters April and Casey Jones. The films centerpiece is a brotherly fight in the rain between Leonardo and Raphael. Rain has never looked so good. The film really fails to live up to this highly emotional scene when we finally reach the far more substandard subplot involving immortal statues and ancient monsters from another dimension.The voice work is standard fair but nothing stands out as terribly as the truly awful Splinter, voiced by a man simply known as Mako, who recently passed away. So at least when the sequel comes around we can get something that sounds a little more like the original splinter other than one who drank just a little too much sake before  each scene. Splinter slurs his wisdom like a drunk whino holding onto his buddies shoulder trying to keep from falling off the bar stool. The turtles sound like you expect them too and Sarah Michelle Gellar goes unnoticed as April O' Neil.The film  has some really impressive action seqeuences and does a fine job of setting itself up for a far better sequel down the line. This one will have to settle for being just slightly above average. If you are a turtles fan, like me, you will find much to enjoy in this revival of a long dead franchise.

TMNT's skateboarding reptiles named after art masters, talking master rat, and Michaelangelo's incessant bad jokes will drive home the nostalgia for any fan of the crime-fighting foursome. The nonstop action, wildly inventive character designs, and impressive computer animation will undoubtedly entertain everyone else.Taking place after the events of the original films, the brotherhood of ninja turtles is thrown into disarray when Leonardo departs for South America to hone his leadership skills at the behest of their sensei, Splinter. Michaelangelo and Donatello attempt to acquire slightly more ""normal"" jobs during Leo's absence, while Raphael, pining for the days of fighting crime, turns to the vigilante justice of his armored alter ego, the Nightwatcher. Upon Leo's return he is met with animosity by Raphael, and Splinter orders the group not to resume their crime fighting duties until they can once again work as a team. But when the mysterious industrialist, Max Winters (voiced by the instantly discernable Patrick Stewart) hires Karai and her Foot Clan to aid in the acquisition of 12 extremely dangerous ancient beasts, Leonardo is captured by the stone generals of a 3,000 year old army attempting to open a portal to another dimension in order to unleash a demon force capable of destroying the earth (did you honestly expect a more conventional plot from a story concerning talking mutant turtles trained in the ways of a ninja?). Now the remaining turtles, along with the help of their friends Casey Jones and April O'Neil, must band together to defeat the dark forces that threaten civilization.It's quite an undertaking to revitalize the cult phenomenon of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, especially after a 14-year film hiatus, but the artists at Imagi Studios have done the adventurous reptiles justice. Highly detailed textures adorn the four heroes' streamlined models and the added attention to their shells and weaponry elevates the overall result. Outlandish antagonist designs stand out against the rather expected look of the human characters, especially several of the twelve ancient monsters and the four stone generals, whose appearances range from inspired to near-genius. Add to that the ridiculously detailed backgrounds and locations that inhabit the turtles' New York cityscape and you've got an animated visual feast rarely equaled. Perhaps the only disappointing character design was that of the curious Max Winters, who looked suspiciously like a rejected cast member from The Incredibles.An impressively diverse voice cast lends their talent in creating the turtles' world with Mitchell Whitfield, James Arnold Taylor, Mikey Kelley, and Nolan North as the teenage heroes while Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Evans portray April and Casey. Patrick Stewart is antagonist Max Winters, while everyone from Laurence Fishburne to Zhang Ziyi to Kevin Smith supplies their voices to secondary roles. The late Mako provides Master Splinter with a slightly raspier tone than any of his previous incarnations, which may be harder to accept for die-hard fans, but still adequately fits the wise sensei figure.While it may appear as if the action never lets up (and it seldom does) an underlying theme of honor, respect, and camaraderie does exist. But enough about that. The action is where TMNT shines and it's properly attended to as the majority of fans would expect from the ninja turtle universe. Top-notch animation brings the ninjas to life in a way live-action never could, with exaggeratedly agile martial arts moves and over-the-top combat. Fantastic fight sequences abound with colossal battles interspersing intense duels, and the radical camera movements and extreme angles highlight every slice of a sword and swing of a sai. A driving rock soundtrack hurries the action along and tight pacing helps keep the truly bizarre bits of the story from drifting too far astray. Incredible particle effects also enhance each fight sequence, most notably in an extraordinary rooftop duel in the rain where one can't help but think ""Cowabunga, dude.""Though only a handful of gags will likely induce full-out laughing in adults, the immature quips that dot the screenplay keep the proceedings consistently lighthearted and guarantee fun for audiences of any age. With more than its fair share of spectacular action and adventure, combined with gorgeous visuals and the deft attention to the fundamentals of mutant ninja turtle doctrine, TMNT superbly carries on the legacy of the heroic crime-fighting brotherhood with style and wit to spare.- Joel Massie",4,TMNT Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie Review,1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,4776,"['decade', 'last',

653364,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JPMZ,Tom Benton,"[1, 4]","Roughly 14 years after their last big-screen appearance, everyone's favorite human-sized, buff turtles return in ""TMNT"".  Director Kevin Munroe made the interesting choice to make the film in CGI after no studio was interested in another life-action Ninja Turtles film (bummer).  CGI works well for the lean, green fighting machines, particularly in ""TMNT"", where the animation is fine-tuned to near perfection.  Also, as was Munroe's intent, the animation resembles the style of a comic book.  This is all great, except for one big flaw: CGI screams family, and in the case of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, family says ""kids"".That's the biggest letdown of Munroe's movie: it's clearly aimed at a younger audience.  Which isn't to say that older audiences can't or won't enjoy it, but those fans expecting at long last a truly ferocious TMNT film should brace themselves to be let down.  Aside from the kid-friendliness of the movie, the only other downside is probably the storyline.  Munroe decided to do something different from this film, and that's okay, but it seems a little too over-the-top for a comeback film.  On the plus side, ""TMNT"" leaves an all-too-obvious hint that the Turtles' nemesis will return should this film warrant a sequel.  Which begs the question, does this film deserve a sequel?Well, let's see - the voicing cast is pretty neat.  The Turtles' voices fit their personalities well.  The rest of the cast, which includes Patrick Stewart, Zhang Ziyi, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Smith (!), have almost instantly-recognizable voices which really add some interest to otherwise dull characters.  Sarah Michelle Gellar does a great job voicing April, and Mako - oh, Mako, rest in peace - is a perfect fit as master Splinter, who steals the show in every one of his scenes.Then there's the script.  It has some ridiculous one-liners, of course, clearly aimed at the kiddies, but there's some cool scenes and great lines (Splinter's interest in soaps?  Priceless!), and it's a perfect length.  In a live-action film the script would never do, but ""TMNT""'s animation is superb enough to keep the film afloat no matter what.So all in all, ""TMNT"" is an interesting and fun film, but it's target audience is too young to really appreciate it, and that fact that it's target audience is so young will leave most older fans feeling rather blue.  However, just because our sewer-dwelling heroes have returned, because of an all-star voice cast, and because of some really super animation, I'd recommend to ""TMNT"" to anyone familiar with the franchise.  It could be better, but face it - it could be a lot worse.",3,Half-shelled,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,2631,"['Roughly', '14', 'years', 'last', 'big-screen', 'appearance', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'human-sized', 'buff', 'turtles', 'return', 'TMNT', 'Director', 'Kevin', 'Munroe', 'made', 'interesting', 'choice', 'make', 'film', 'CGI', 'studio', 'was', 'interested', 'life-action', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'film', 'bummer', 'CGI', 'well', 'lean', 'green', 'fighting', 'machines', 'particularly', 'TMNT', 'where', 'animation', 'fine-tuned', 'perfection', 'Also', 'was', 'Munroe', 'intent', 'animation', 'style', 'comic', 'book', 'great', 'one', 'big', 'flaw', 'CGI', 'screams', 'family', 'case', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'family', 'kids', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'Munroe', 'movie', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'younger', 'audience', 'Which', ""n't"", 'say', 'older', 'audiences', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'fans', 'expecting', 'long', 'last', 'truly', 'ferocious', 'TMNT', 'film', 'should', 'brace', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'Aside', 'kid-friendliness', 'movie', 'only', 'other', 'downside', 'probably', 'storyline', 'Munroe', 'decided', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'film', 'okay', 'little', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'comeback', 'film', 'plus', 'side', 'TMNT', 'all-too-obvious', 'hint', 'Turtles', 'nemesis', 'will', 'return', 'should', 'film', 'warrant', 'sequel', 'question', 'film', 'deserve', 'sequel', 'Well', 'let', 'see', 'voicing', 'cast', 'pretty', 'neat', 'Turtles', 'voices', 'fit', 'personalities', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'have', 'almost', 'instantly-recognizable', 'voices', 'really', 'add', 'interest', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'characters', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'great', 'job', 'voicing', 'April', 'Mako', 'oh', 'Mako', 'rest', 'peace', 'perfect', 'fit', 'master', 'Splinter', 'who', 'show', 'one', 'scenes.Then', 'script', 'ridiculous', 'one-liners', 'course', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'kiddies', 'cool', 'scenes', 'great', 'lines', 'Splinter', 'interest', 'soaps', 'Priceless', 'perfect', 'length', 'live-action', 'film', 'script', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'TMNT', 'animation', 'superb', 'enough', 'keep', 'film', 'afloat', 'matter', 'what.So', 'TMNT', 'interesting', 'fun', 'film', 'target', 'audience', 'too', 'young', 'really', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'target', 'audience', 'so', 'young', 'will', 'leave', 'most', 'older', 'fans', 'feeling', 'rather', 'blue', 'However', 'just', 'sewer-dwelling', 'heroes', 'have', 'returned', 'all-star', 'voice', 'cast', 'really', 'super', 'animation', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'TMNT', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'franchise', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'face', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'worse']",N/A

653367,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JPMZ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 3]","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles came to huge national prominence during my early teenage years and my youngest brother was a huge fan of the original cartoon series.  Therefore, I won't deny that part of my attachment for the Turtles is rooted in nostalgia and sentimentality.  However, the concept of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a very interesting one and is full of ripe movie making possibilities.Attempting to pacify fans of all the various incarnations of the Turtles (comics, original cartoons, live action films, new cartoon series), TMNT incorporates CGI action more similar to the new animated series.  However, the storyline of the film begins approximately a year after the events in the live action film TEENAGE MUTANT TURTLES III.Since once again defeating Shredder and traveling through time, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have returned to a New York City that isn't as violent and crime-ridden as it used to be.  For all intents and purposes the Foot has been disbanded and violent crime in the city has dramatically dropped.  In short, the city doesn't seem to have any use for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles right now.  Their sensei and father, the giant rat Splinter, knows that the current peace that pervades the city will not last.  The Turtles seem to be growing apart and perhaps sensing his own mortality, Splinter wants the Turtles to work and fight together as a unified team and become a true family.  Therefore, he sends Leonardo to South America to train and become a better leader.  The brothers miss Leo, but they move on:  Michelangelo works as a children's party attraction, Donatello has started a tech-support business, and Raphael, unbeknownst to his family, prowls the night as the hooded vigilante Knightwatcher.Meanwhile, a cosmic alignment is on the verge of occurring for the first time in 3,000 years and seems connected to the appearance of various giant monsters appearing in and around the city.  There's also the sudden revival of the Foot clan.  Through their connection with April O'Neil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Casey Jones (Chris Evans), who now are dating, the Turtles learn that the events are all connected to the philanthropic billionaire Max Winters (Patrick Stewart).  With the help of O'Neil and Jones the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have to figure out what the connection between Winters, the Foot, the monsters, and the stone warriors is and in the process save the city from destruction on an apocalyptic scale.As far as CGI animated films go, TMNT is pretty good.  Freed from the constraints of live action animatronics or costumed people, TMNT tells a much more action oriented story.  The animation is vivid and sleek, but has an overall visually dark tone reminiscent of the original Turtle comics.  The storyline of the film combines elements of both historical fantasy and science fiction and successfully connects the stories of the live-action Teenage Turtle Ninja Turtles movies to the newer animated series.  Some might find the general plot a bit unwieldy, but for anyone who grew up with the Turtles, the plot doesn't seem all that far-fetched and actually is more grounded than some other turtle stories (TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES III anyone?).Overall, I enjoyed TMNT.  I thought the filmmakers did an excellent job of tying together all the different strands of Turtle canon that not only unites it in a coherent film, but also makes a good movie that appeals both to fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the general public.  I especially liked seeing the action sequences where the Turtles, Casey Jones, April, and Splinter fight together.  Seeing Splinter in action reminded me of seeing Yoda fight for the first time in ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  I also liked how April wasn't as prissy as she was presented to be in the first live action Turtle films; she's not afraid to fight in this movie and brings an additional asset to the team instead of a liability.  The movie also has a great soundtrack and score.  Highly recommended for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fans, but also has appeal to anyone who enjoys well developed animated films.As an extra, listen for Kevin Smith as the voice of a Diner.

So I was very excited to see the new CGI TMNT, but the horde of terrible reviews came so fast it made my head spin. I finally got a chance to catch this movie on HBO and FORSHAME ON ALL OF YOU WHO HATED THIS MOVIE!!!This was a great story with a great cast of characters. The story takes place after Shredder and the Turtles are not actually teenagers anymore. The story has a lot of emotion and great dilogue between the turtles even an excellent falling out with Leo and Raph that just left me awestruck. Making this an animated film was the right way to go because the action sequences were mind blowing. This was just a great way to lose myself in fantasy for a good hour and a half.

But this newest saga in the Turtles quest, simply called TNMT, has been advertised for a couple of years, and now has finally come to pass, and it is killer. Classic turtle fighting, with some drama. The family isn't such a happy family, as Leonardo has left for an extended training to become a better leader, leaving the other turtles to fend for themselves...in the real world.  Donnatello does phone computer supportand young michelangelo does birthday parties as a giant turtle, go figure.  Will Leonardo find his way and return to his brothers, and will his brothers accept him again.  And will everything work out as a new great terror is about to destroy the earth.  Just get thsi film.  This is by far the most advanced CGI movie to date.  Just great angles and details.  I can only dream of what the future may hold in CGI, but if this film is just a shimmer of it...were in for some great films.  Must have for turtle fans, old and new alike.",5,"WOW, Best CGI to date.

653370,A3OND36Q71G76D,B00005JPMZ,W. Scott Heitman,"[2, 3]","Animation in the US has long been considered kid's fare.  This standard applies even more to computer animation.  Back in the glory days of Disney and Bluth studios, animated movies were something that adults didn't mind viewing with their kids.  Now, computer animated films are something to keep the tykes glued to the screen while parents take a break.Of course, this viewpoint is naive, and other countries such as Japan have long proven that animation is both an art form and a compelling medium for mature entertainment.  The same proves true for computer animation.  While the first Final Fantasy film (the only one to come to US theaters) was lacking in plot, both Final Fantasy films have stunning near-photorealistic visuals that scream ""art"".Previously, the only hint of adult-targeted animated film in the US has been the much underratedTitan A.E. (Special Edition).  The film wasn't widely seen, though, and here we come to the present.TMNT enters the scene with all of the pieces in place.  A star-studded voice cast (Patrick Stewart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Chris Evans, Zhang Ziyi, and Laurence Fishburne to name a few), high quality animation, a largely well-written and humorous script, and some nice choreography make the film easy to recommend to anyone with the slightest fondness for the classic sewer dwellers.The story, itself, may come across as outlandish but only to those that are unfamiliar with the comics.  The comics see the turtles crossing into other dimensions and battling a host of foes in addition to the iconic ""Shredder"".  Once you get past the fact that this isn't going to be the same ""defeat shredder"" set-up you've seen before, you may realize that the story is quite compelling.  Thematically, things are kept in line with the past movies, but because of the freedom computer animation provides, these themes are approached with greater dramatic strength.  I was only disappointed at how quickly things were resolved...the initial set-up promises a curse that (in my eyes) could have taken several movies to resolve.  I suppose the filmmakers can be forgiven for their awareness that half of their audience will be youngsters that don't DO two hour movies.  Still, the one flaw in the film remains that the conclusion comes too abruptly, and even the final fight seems rushed (slight spoiler: an enemy the four turtles couldn't handle earlier on is defeated in a one-on-one sequence in the finale...?)Ultimately, TMNT is a good deal smarter than I expected it to be.  The mainstream nature of the film promises that a number of adults will get to see it and enjoy it- even if that only happens once it reaches dvd.  I can only hope that we will see more of the turtles in this form- and that the movie manages to change a few adult minds on the nature of computer animation.",5,Maybe there's hope for adult-oriented animation afterall...,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,2818,"['Animation', 'US', 'long', 'been', 'considered', 'kid', 'fare', 'standard', 'applies', 'even', 'more', 'computer', 'animation', 'Back', 'glory', 'days', 'Disney', 'Bluth', 'studios', 'animated', 'movies', 'were', 'something', 'adults', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'viewing', 'kids', 'Now', 'computer', 'animated', 'films', 'are', 'something', 'keep', 'tykes', 'glued', 'screen', 'parents', 'take', 'break.Of', 'course', 'viewpoint', 'naive', 'other', 'countries', 'such', 'Japan', 'have', 'long', 'proven', 'animation', 'art', 'form', 'compelling', 'medium', 'mature', 'entertainment', 'same', 'true', 'computer', 'animation', 'first', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'come', 'US', 'theaters', 'was', 'lacking', 'plot', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'films', 'have', 'stunning', 'near-photorealistic', 'visuals', 'scream', 'art', '.Previously', 'only', 'hint', 'adult-targeted', 'animated', 'film', 'US', 'been', 'much', 'underratedTitan', 'A.E', 'Special', 'Edition', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'widely', 'seen', 'here', 'come', 'present.TMNT', 'scene', 'pieces', 'place', 'star-studded', 'voice', 'cast', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'name', 'few', 'high', 'quality', 'animation', 'largely', 'well-written', 'humorous', 'script', 'nice', 'choreography', 'make', 'film', 'easy', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'slightest', 'fondness', 'classic', 'sewer', 'dwellers.The', 'story', 'may', 'come', 'outlandish', 'only', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'comics', 'comics', 'see', 'turtles', 'crossing', 'other', 'dimensions', 'battling', 'host', 'foes', 'addition', 'iconic', 'Shredder', 'Once', 'get', 'fact', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'same', 'defeat', 'shredder', 'set-up', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'may', 'realize', 'story', 'quite', 'compelling', 'Thematically', 'things', 'are', 'kept', 'line', 'past', 'movies', 'freedom', 'computer', 'animation', 'themes', 'are', 'approached', 'greater', 'dramatic', 'strength', 'was', 'only', 'disappointed', 'how', 'quickly', 'things', 'were', 'resolved', 'initial', 'set-up', 'promises', 'curse', 'eyes', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'several', 'movies', 'resolve', 'suppose', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'awareness', 'half', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'youngsters', 'do', ""n't"", 'DO', 'two', 'hour', 'movies', 'Still', 'one', 'flaw', 'film', 'conclusion', 'too', 'abruptly', 'even', 'final', 'fight', 'rushed', 'slight', 'spoiler', 'enemy', 'four', 'turtles', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'earlier', 'defeated', 'one-on-one', 'sequence', 'finale', 'Ultimately', 'TMNT', 'good', 'deal', 'smarter', 'expected', 'be', 'mainstream', 'nature', 'film', 'number', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'enjoy', 'it-', 'even', 'only', 'dvd', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'turtles', 'form-', 'movie', 'change', 'few', 'adult', 'minds', 'nature', 'computer', 'animation']",N/A

My boyfriend convinced me to go see this and I was pleasently surprised. I thought it was very entertaining! The animation was great, the action was awesome, it had a lot of funny one-liners and I thought it had a strong plot. I liked the rivalry between the two brothers and I thought the movie carried a good message for kids about taking responsibility, working together and forgiving your family, etc. It's not the typical movie I am into but I really hope they make another one. This is more of a kids movie but good for adults also if you are looking for something fun and lighthearted. Another wonderful thing, in the theatre all the kids were so glued to the screen they were all SILENT! None of them made so much as a peep. Any movie that can make a bunch of 5-10 year old boys sit quiet with their hands in their lap must be pretty good! Simply amazing!
