952070,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000BX0VTG,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Valachi Papers, 1972 filmJoseph Valachi is in prison. He seems to be out of favor with his associates. A man with a knife attacks him but fails. Its solitary confinement for Joe. Is his food poisoned? He wants to see his lawyer. Joe survives another attack! But now it is a murder charge. A Federal Official arrives with news about an open contract! He gets to meet Don Vito. Some guys can't do the time, he says. Bad apples have to be removed. ""Who said you did anything wrong?"" [Note the looks on their faces.] Vito names a figure. Joe decides to talk to that Federal agent. Joe is sent to Ossining and meets his cellmates. They talk about business. There's a war on. It took Joe's gang a minute to pull a job, the police need two minutes to respond. This presents a history of gang warfare in New York city. Buster was brought from Chicago to kill a rival. An apartment is rented so the target can be watched. [Can a Tommy gun really fit into a violin case?]Shots are fired, two men fall. What about the others? ""Initiative."" Valachi puts on a suit, he is initiated into the Cosa Nostra with a blood ritual. Joe is part of the family now, even if not from Castellamara. These conflicts can be compared to Imperial conflicts over colonies and their wealth. There are beatings, shootings, and the disposal of by- products. Death is an occupational disease, like soldiers in combat. A funeral is disturbed by the arrival of rivals. Can they arrange a truce that will be good for business? ""My condolences."" Later a rival is given a surprise early retirement. There are more shootings and killings [to provide action]. Valachi seeks refuge with the wife of a business associate. [Note the old-style refrigerator in the kitchen.] Joe is a good soldier. ""Maria is no toy."" Joe is invited back into the gang.Genovese offers his friendship to Letizia, which can be more important than a lawyer or the police. Joe is sent out on a special operation, then reports back about a man who died from ""shortness of breath"". [A description of congestive heart failure.] Joseph and Maria are married. Many guests arrive to pay their respects and wish them happiness. Vito must vacation abroad. Can he start a business with drugs? Fixing a horse race can provide big profits. They learn about Vito's girlfriend's friend! [For shock value?] Don Vito returns and asks Joe to locate a man. This man will provide a ""gift"". Joe does him a favor. Later there is an assassination in a barber shop.There is a meeting at a country estate. Don Vito examines the faults of the organization. But shots interrupt the meeting! The NY State Police raid this meeting. Later two officials ask for information on the drug operation. Joe tells how drugs were smuggled into this country. Who stashed the drugs in Vito's home? ""Tony and Joe"" is the answer. Was a telephone tap used to get information? Joe is arrested and faces 15 years. Will he cooperate with a Senatorial investigation? Yes, and it is a national sensation in 1963. Vito offers $100,000 for Joe Valachi. [About a million today - and tax free.] Joe has remorse in his prison cell; he was depressed. They treat him at the infirmary. Will Joe outlive Don Vito?The Valachi Hearings were a news sensation in the summer of 1963. [Until November.] Was this movie meant to cash in from that better movie from 1972? Is organized crime tolerated because of its benefits to the Establishment? The movie ""Key Largo"" used the return of a mob boss as part of its story. [Did it echo ""The Petrified Forest""?] No other administration before or after JFK went after organized crime like he did.

952072,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,B000BX0VTG,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[8, 12]","Having come out almost right after ""The Godfather"" (though the book came out much earlier), this movie tried to capitalize on Coppola's masterpiece and the publics' appetite for mob flicks, so it had big shoes to fill. By that comparison, it pales. On its own, it fits into the category of movies like, ""The St. Valentines Day Massacre."" It leaves a little bit to be desired in performances (cerainly in brand name actors aside from Charles Bronson), dialogue and editing/continuity. But the story it tells is true, based on a book that by itself tells the story  of a mobster turned informant because of the contract unjustifiably put on his head. The movie satisfies those who crave the ingredients offered in the mob genre- violence, hits, blood, betrayal, loyalty, misguided power hungry individuals, and mistrust. And it can be argued that the cast of largely unknown Italian actors lends a feel of authenticity to the movie. But it does come down to script, dialogue and what is done with it by those actors, and in that, though the movie is a guilty pleasure of mine, it does come up short. But it does detail the hierarchy of the mafia over several years, how that changed due to power struggles, and how it affected those who lived within it. Bronson's Valachi character is the sympathetic figure in this movie and the movie is told from his perspective and that of the FBI agent to whom he provides information- in violation of the oath of mob code of secrecy he's sworn to- in exchange for protection from his assailants (the agent being the only other familiar face in this movie- he from a late 60s/ early 70s police TV show, perhaps ""The Mod Squad""). There is some unforgettable dialogue, but unlike ""The Godfather,"" it's for more forgetable reasons. Example? At the funeral of an executed mobster, his widow pleads to Salvatore Maranzano, the head of the mob at the time, to bring life back to her husband. Maranzano's reply? ""I no can bring back the dead. Only keel the living."" That said, that's actually part of the appeal to this movie. It doesn't purport to be anything it isn't. On it's own devices this is an informative, if not entertaining movie. Not all mob movies, parcularly of this era or earlier, strived to the award winning excellence of ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Godfathers,"" even ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" or ""A Bronx Tale""- movies where the dilogue is as vital as the action. In this movie, the dialogue merely pieces the story together, and not much more. Couple other points of note. Jill Ireland, Bronson's real life wife, plays his wife in this movie. And perhaps the most notable to those who are fans of this movie, the sight of the Twin Towers in the background during one scene, in a movie that takes place starting in the 30s. That aside, taken on its own merits, as far as mob movies from its period, this one ain't so bad, which I admit isn't exactly a ringing endorsement.",3,"Not bad, but don't expect ""The Godfather""",1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,2905,"['Having', 'come', 'out', 'almost', 'right', 'Godfather', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'much', 'earlier', 'movie', 'tried', 'capitalize', 'Coppola', 'masterpiece', 'publics', 'appetite', 'mob', 'flicks', 'had', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'comparison', 'own', 'category', 'movies', 'St.', 'Valentines', 'Day', 'Massacre', 'little', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'performances', 'cerainly', 'brand', 'name', 'actors', 'aside', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'dialogue', 'editing/continuity', 'story', 'true', 'based', 'book', 'story', 'mobster', 'turned', 'informant', 'contract', 'unjustifiably', 'put', 'head', 'movie', 'satisfies', 'who', 'crave', 'ingredients', 'offered', 'mob', 'genre-', 'violence', 'hits', 'blood', 'betrayal', 'loyalty', 'misguided', 'power', 'hungry', 'individuals', 'mistrust', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'cast', 'largely', 'unknown', 'Italian', 'actors', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'come', 'script', 'dialogue', 'what', 'done', 'actors', 'movie', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'detail', 'hierarchy', 'mafia', 'several', 'years', 'how', 'changed', 'due', 'power', 'struggles', 'how', 'affected', 'who', 'lived', 'Bronson', 'Valachi', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'movie', 'movie', 'told', 'perspective', 'FBI', 'agent', 'whom', 'information-', 'violation', 'oath', 'mob', 'code', 'secrecy', 'sworn', 'to-', 'exchange', 'protection', 'assailants', 'agent', 'being', 'only', 'other', 'familiar', 'face', 'movie-', 'late', '60s/', 'early', '70s', 'police', 'TV', 'show', 'perhaps', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'unforgettable', 'dialogue', 'Godfather', 'more', 'forgetable', 'reasons', 'Example', 'funeral', 'executed', 'mobster', 'widow', 'pleads', 'Salvatore', 'Maranzano', 'head', 'mob', 'time', 'bring', 'life', 'back', 'husband', 'Maranzano', 'reply', 'can', 'bring', 'back', 'dead', 'Only', 'keel', 'living', 'said', 'actually', 'part', 'appeal', 'movie', ""n't"", 'purport', 'be', 'anything', ""n't"", 'own', 'devices', 'informative', 'not', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Not', 'mob', 'movies', 'parcularly', 'era', 'earlier', 'strived', 'award', 'winning', 'excellence', 'Goodfellas', 'Godfathers', 'even', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'movies', 'where', 'dilogue', 'as', 'vital', 'action', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'merely', 'story', 'together', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'Couple', 'other', 'points', 'note', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'Bronson', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'wife', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'most', 'notable', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'movie', 'sight', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'background', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'place', 'starting', '30s', 'aside', 'taken', 'own', 'merits', 'as', 'far', 'mob', 'movies', 'period', 'one', 'ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'admit', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'ringing', 'endorsement']",The Valachi Papers

952079,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B000BX0VTG,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""The Valachi Papers"" is a 1972 production about the infamous mafia rat Joe Valachi. This movie has recieved mixed reviews over the years; it has the benefit of using one of the first exposes on the mafia as its template, but also the limitations of Hollywood in transition. The late 60's and early 70's saw huge changes in Hollywood; the old studio executives were being replaced by a new generation. With this new wave, came greater artistic freedoms. Without these freedoms, film makers would never have come close to duplicating mobsters on screen.This movie is such a good example of this transitional era. The plot of this film, based on the the 1969 tell all by Peter Maas, is light years ahead of the gangster movies released in the 1950's and early 60's. The ability of producer Dino De Laurentis to adhere to a work of superb journalism is what makes the storyline live up to modern screenwriting. Prior to this film (as well as ""The Godfather"", which was released the same year), the public's perception of the mob as derived from the media was way off base. The cigar chomping cliches of Hollywood's first gangsters are for the most part done away with here. What's left is a story that is now viewed as the first true to life account of what actually happened within the New York City mafia in the first half of the 20th century.The biggest strength of this picture was its use of Peter Maas' book. Nowadays, the Valachi case is like the year zero for journalists and true crime writers who seek to expose the mafia. The public's knowledge of the real truths of organized crime  could be split into everything before the Valachi era (which included Applachin and Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"") and everything that came after, specifically the FBI assault on LCN that began with Donny Brasco and concluded with the conviction of John Gotti.Even though this movie has all the twists and turns of a modern masterpiece about mafia families, there are still alot foibles that make it far from perfect. When compared to ""The Godfather"", its probably not even in the same category as far as production and direction go. The feel to this movie is in some ways quite raw. Charles Bronson plays the title role; his preformance is not by any means stellar, but the screenplay baaed from Maas' book carries this picture from start to finish. Bronson is no Brando. I'm not sure that he got the Italian machismo all that much. He often comes off more like a traditional Hollywood tough guy mobster, but with the lines that hold up to any mafia story that could be released today.If Bronson was a little short of grasping Italian charisma, the other characters over compensate. The actors who play Vito Genovese, Lucky Luciano, Albert Anastasia and others are all Italian nationals, complete with heavy accents. Most versions of the era in question portray these men more as New Yorkers rather than immigrants. This picture had some problems in the details, but it still stands as a classic mafia story. This movie went along way in giving the public a dose of harsh reality in the underworld. The story according to Valachi paints a bloody picture. There are hits galore here.

952083,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B000BX0VTG,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[0, 1]","Actually while this film has some annoying weaknesses it's also got a lot of decent merit. For one thing it's pretty much dead-on accurate to the real events that took place during the early days of the mafia in NY city. While the film feels sort of like a spaggetti western due to the fact that it's a half American and half Italliain production, and the voices of some of the characters seem cheesy like they would in a spaggetti western, it's somewhat forgivable because the film has an honorable history. For one thing, if my memory serves correctly, it was released just weeks before The Godfather in 1972 and was overshadowed by the superiority of Coppola's fictional masterpiece, While the far more accurate story here got ignored. It's easy to understand why. This movie was simply produced fairly poorly. Like a cut below Sergio Leone's pretty great film about the mob, 'Once upon a time in America' which came more than 10 years later. I found it interesting that this film now has a PG rating, which it really shouldn't have. It's loaded with some rather harsh violence and nudity. In 1972 when it did have an ""R"" rating this movie was considered fairly brutal.. But times have changed I guess. I still think the film deserves a solid ""R"" anyway. Though the film has it's weaknesses it's really pretty decent. Bronson is perfect in the role of Valachi. The film tells the story like it really happened as apposed to The Gofather which was not the story of any real mafia family. This film tells it like it was, even if it's production values are at moments, rather laughable, complete with cookie cutter Italian music and cheap Itallian accents. The film does ok anyway. But in the hands of the right director it could have been even better. Over all though I think it's still very good despite it's production weaknesses.",3,"Nearly forgivable weaknesses aside, the film is rather memorable",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,1833,"['Actually', 'film', 'annoying', 'weaknesses', 'also', 'got', 'lot', 'decent', 'merit', 'one', 'thing', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead-on', 'accurate', 'real', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'early', 'days', 'mafia', 'NY', 'city', 'film', 'feels', 'sort', 'spaggetti', 'western', 'due', 'fact', 'half', 'American', 'half', 'Italliain', 'production', 'voices', 'characters', 'seem', 'cheesy', 'would', 'spaggetti', 'western', 'somewhat', 'forgivable', 'film', 'honorable', 'history', 'one', 'thing', 'memory', 'correctly', 'was', 'released', 'just', 'weeks', 'Godfather', '1972', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'superiority', 'Coppola', 'fictional', 'masterpiece', 'far', 'more', 'accurate', 'story', 'here', 'got', 'ignored', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'simply', 'produced', 'fairly', 'poorly', 'cut', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'pretty', 'great', 'film', 'mob', 'time', 'America', 'came', 'more', '10', 'years', 'later', 'found', 'interesting', 'film', 'now', 'PG', 'rating', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'loaded', 'rather', 'harsh', 'violence', 'nudity', '1972', 'when', 'did', 'have', 'R', 'rating', 'movie', 'was', 'considered', 'fairly', 'brutal..', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'guess', 'still', 'think', 'film', 'solid', 'R', 'anyway', 'film', 'really', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Bronson', 'perfect', 'role', 'Valachi', 'film', 'story', 'really', 'happened', 'apposed', 'Gofather', 'was', 'not', 'story', 'real', 'mafia', 'family', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'moments', 'rather', 'laughable', 'complete', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'Italian', 'music', 'cheap', 'Itallian', 'accents', 'film', 'ok', 'anyway', 'hands', 'right', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'think', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'production', 'weaknesses']",The Valachi Papers

Based on Joe Valachi's Grand Jury testimony that lifted the veil on the way the mob worked and was organized after years of denial of its very existence by J. Edgar Hoover, it's a well-crafted and enjoyable saga with none of the operatic grandeur that Coppola, Leone and De Palma would bring to the genre. There's not much in the way of historical or social context, more a catalog of greatest hits and internecine feuding, but it's done with some flair and is surprisingly entertaining. Bronson makes a good lead, with decent support from Walter Chiari and Lino Ventura, both surprisingly well dubbed.
