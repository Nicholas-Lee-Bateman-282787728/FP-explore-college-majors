I may be in the minority regarding this, but I did not like Shirley MacLaine as Cora's mother.  I thought that her performance was mostly forced and dry, although it was well-written in the fact that Martha Levinson was intended to be Violet's opposite yet equal force.  I felt that Ms MacLaine was only moderately successful in the role, but that's just my opinion.I also felt that the Bates story line was a bit overdone, and was glad when it came to a conclusion.  The season's ending, of course, was a stunner, but I'm not believing anything until I see it in a coffin.  (That's my ostrich impression for the day.)  Mrs. Hughes and her health condition was riveting; I felt for her every step of the way. I did not too much like the flighty-cousin (Rose) story line, but I did like her kindness to Anna, and the fact that she obviously has some kind of drama coming around the bend.I still recommend this series; I do love to watch it, and can't wait to see what happens!",4,"Wonderful!

193534,A1AYNQ4Q8AZ0X,1608838137,anonymous,"[1, 1]","Though I had some minor quibbles, I enjoyed Season 3 of ""Downton Abbey"" a lot.  It proved it's still an addictive, well-acted, stylish soap.  It was a lot of fun even though I didn't like all that went down at Downton this year....SPOILER WARNING!For instance, it made no sense that Martha Levinson would come to town for Mary's nuptials but not Edith's wedding, Sybil's funeral or the birth of Mary and Matthew's son.  (Perhaps she'll show up at the start of Season 4 to meet her new grandson and mourn Matthew.) It also made no sense (and infuriated me) that Mr. Bates felt bad enough for Thomas that he went to bat for him when he was going to be fired without a job reference.  Given how poorly Thomas had always treated Mr. Bates, it was hard to believe that anyone--even Bates--would be so pious, so forgiving.  And the reappearance of Ethel just so she could give up her baby didn't seem to serve much purpose except to give Matthew's mother a new project (and cause friction between her and the Crawleys after she put Ethel to work in her house).That's not to say there weren't great dramatic moments this year....Mary and Matthew's wedding kicked things off with lots of style; Edith getting jilted at the altar was unfortunate but very entertaining; Sybil's death was shocking but forced the Crawleys to accept and respect Tom as a member of the family, and it drove a wedge between Robert and Cora.  (Leave it to Violet to find a way to bring them back together!) I was sad to see Matthew die because the show's Juliet has now lost her Romeo.  I enjoyed watching their relationship blossom over the first two seasons, and I thought the show handled their short married life well by having them butt heads from time to time.  They were never boring, but now that part of the story has come to an abrupt (and unplanned) end.  I know this isn't what the creator had in mind for the couple, so I hope the show can survive the loss of Matthew.END SPOILERSI believe in rating not just the show itself but the Blu-ray too.  Like its predecessors, this season's Blu-ray release of ""Downton Abbey"" is presented in 1080i and 2.0 stereo (according to the back of the case).  Other websites have stated in their professional reviews that the video is actually 1080p.  Either way, it looks great.  However, the fact that the audio consists of 2 channels only is ridiculous.  In 2013, it's commonplace for shows to be released with 5.1 mixes, and this show would certainly benefit from the extra channels.  And like its predecessors, this season's release has neither a printed nor on-screen episode guide with descriptions of each episode, nor does it have a season play feature that remembers where you left off.  I find these omissions inexcusable given the fact that the episodes are simply numbered (not entitled) on screen (except for the special episode that aired on Christmas in England).  Not even the disc labels tell you which episodes are contained on which discs: you have to pop them into your player to find that out.  For these reasons, I'm taking a full star off this product's rating.Though I was a bit disappointed here and there, I still found myself riveted to the show.  I look forward to Season 4 with great enthusiasm!

I'll be watching the rest of Season 3 as it becomes available.I want to avoid spoilers or plot giveaways, so I'll just describe overall characteristics of the show.This fascinating, serious drama evinces a subtle, generous love of humanity, and makes you love humanity, the wonderful qualities, the foibles, and the frailties, and how all that stands up to the darker side of human nature.  The writing is excellent; the show's plot always has me on edge.  Out of dozens of characters two or three are bad and rather wicked, but on the whole it seems every episode moves me at some point to shed a tear or two because of the kindness and goodness and generosity of various characters.  And it's not that the writers set out in a contrived way to do that.  It all unfolds very naturally out of the drama itself.The show is not a comedy, but there are touches of humor here and there that manage to be moving even as they amuse.  The show is about an extended family of the British aristocracy and their servants.  The daughters are looking to get married.  So are some of the servants.  There is even a murder.  Oh, yes, and World War I is going on during a number of episodes, involving all the characters in huge changes.  And it turns out there are some beautifully noble qualities in some of these titled nobles, as well as in a number of their servants.  The few characters with a more or less sinister side just add more drama, nuance, and depth to a show that on the whole reveals the best of human beings, without oversimplifying them.  Something about this show trusts human beings.  It makes me think that perhaps the best of Britain is something ""very good indeed.""",5,"Great story with a heart of gold: Seasons 1, 2, and first episode of Season 3",1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,1744,"['.This', 'review', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', '3', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'rest', 'Season', '3', 'available.I', 'want', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'plot', 'giveaways', ""'ll"", 'just', 'describe', 'overall', 'characteristics', 'show.This', 'fascinating', 'serious', 'drama', 'subtle', 'generous', 'love', 'humanity', 'love', 'humanity', 'wonderful', 'qualities', 'foibles', 'frailties', 'how', 'up', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'writing', 'excellent', 'show', 'plot', 'always', 'edge', 'dozens', 'characters', 'two', 'three', 'are', 'bad', 'rather', 'wicked', 'whole', 'episode', 'point', 'shed', 'tear', 'two', 'kindness', 'goodness', 'generosity', 'various', 'characters', 'not', 'writers', 'set', 'out', 'contrived', 'way', 'do', 'unfolds', 'very', 'naturally', 'drama', 'itself.The', 'show', 'not', 'comedy', 'are', 'touches', 'humor', 'here', 'there', 'manage', 'be', 'moving', 'even', 'amuse', 'show', 'extended', 'family', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'servants', 'daughters', 'are', 'looking', 'get', 'married', 'are', 'servants', 'even', 'murder', 'Oh', 'yes', 'World', 'War', 'going', 'number', 'episodes', 'involving', 'characters', 'huge', 'changes', 'out', 'are', 'beautifully', 'noble', 'qualities', 'titled', 'nobles', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'servants', 'few', 'characters', 'more', 'less', 'sinister', 'side', 'just', 'add', 'more', 'drama', 'nuance', 'depth', 'show', 'whole', 'best', 'human', 'beings', 'oversimplifying', 'Something', 'show', 'human', 'beings', 'think', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Britain', 'something', 'very', 'good', 'indeed']",N/A

This is difficult to start with because I find each character/actor/actress so impressive.  Who pops to mind first? Thinking about season 3 brings me to the terror of Sybil's death.  Of course everyone at this point has fallen in love with Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay).  The shear agony of everyone in the household which now includes the &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; audience, is shocked by her death.  I was impressed by the truth of the era where child birth was indeed common.  Regardless, I had trouble facing the fact of her death.  The argument between Sybil's parents was so honest and Tom's heartache with his daughter was real.  I believed.  Throughout Season 3 Tom Branson's (Allen Leech) strength of character developed and the entire family gathered support for him and Sibby.  The storyline of John Bates (Brendan Coyle) was remarkable.  The prison scenes were grueling but Anna (Joanne Froggatt) was always there for her man. It was remarkable that Bates got to come back home.  Mary (Michelle Dockery) always shows such stress that I can't find her character remarkable at all.  The cast of the the &#34;house&#34; are significantly more impressive and lots more fun! Thomas (Rob James-Collier) albeit arrogant has a deeper character in Season 3 and he bridges so well with the rest of the house staff.  I could go on about each character but the above are my best of the best.  Of course we must include the kind, gentle and most lovable of the cast, Matthew (Dan Stevens).  In Seasons 1 & 2 he quietly worked his magic charm into the entire family and this season he won Downton Abbey via monetarily as well as in marriage.  The terrible accident that befalls Matthew at the end of Season 3 has so traumatized fans that they tell me they will never watch another episode of Downton Abbey.  I myself have been in mourning since the end of last season, but I am waiting with baited breath for Season 4.

The first episode picks up with Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley at last about to get hitched, but as usual there is quite a lot going on at Downton both above and below stairs and you just know that nothing is going to go smoothly.Shirley Maclaine makes her appearance as Martha Levinson, Lady Grantham's American mother. As usual, Violet, played by Maggie Smith manages to set the scene with some rather pithy comments. Martha has no time for the stuffy English and their traditions and is not slow to voice her opinion. Clearly she was introduced as a foil to Maggie Smith and the interplay between the two does work very well as one suspected it would. Violet seems to manage to continue to dominate any scene she is in.There are plenty of dramatic moments in the new series, as life on the Downton estate returns to more as it was shown in the first series, before the First World War when it served as a convalescent home for injured servicemen. However, there are new challenges for Downton in the post war period and there has to be change for the estate to survive. The interaction between the family and those that serve them `below stairs' continues to be a rich source of story lines for the script writers and is a major contribution to the success of the show.Downton Abbey is the most successful costume drama from British TV since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago - and this is quite an accolade as they produce a lot of this sort of drama in the UK. Regular viewers of Downton will have been holding their breath wondering whether Series 3 could possibly keep up the very high standards of the previous episodes. However, we need not have worried and few will be disappointed with the latest series.

Why not have John Bates run away to become a barnstorming pilot?  Why not have Lady Grantham swept away by an alluring Sheik of Araby?Right!

Every single time after the first episode, I am once again a DA addict. Just try pulling me away!Right off the top, let me get something off my chest.  I THINK BATES IS GUILTY. Am I the only one to think that way? I  just do not see his late wife, a character who lived for revenge, killing herself, which is the only alternative. I guess you could argue that this was a primo act of revenge but she was doing fabulously well against Bates and Anna revenge wise with limitless prospects for further success. Why end such a pleasurable experience which she could watch endlessly unfold?  She was already making them absolutely miserable! If it turns out she was a suicide, I think it is the only misstep the writers made. So this remains a big plot element in season three downstairs with Anna still trying to exonerate him.Upstairs we have the wedding for Matthew and Lady Mary with further quarrels leading them all the way to the altar.  These two will not have a staid marriage and that is all to the good. Sybil is present with Tom and will be shortly delivering her baby. Hugh Bonneville, the lord and master of the abbey, is again beset on all sides.  He makes many mistakes based on his aristocratic viewpoint of the world.  At heart this is the prime problem for all of these people, they grew up in an aristocracy and the aristocracy is precisely what is no longer needed in post world war one England.But the best characters are the three older women, the matriarchs of all other characters.  These are the dowager countess, played wonderfully by Maggie Smith, Matthew's mother, and Shirley MacLaine as the present countess's American mother. You would think the dowager countess would be a complete anachronism with the future being firmly represented by the other two matriarchs.  However, as the power behind the throne, Smith is incredible.  There is always power behind the throne and it is often a woman who has it.  Smith thus continues to be a major delight.As usual, I am anxiously awaiting the next episode.  sigh.....",5,I always start off thinking i won't like it and then get hooked anew,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,2154,"['show', 'huge', 'family', 'saga', 'historical', 'romance', 'always', 'think', 'will', 'resist', 'being', 'pulled', 'world', 'single', 'time', 'first', 'episode', 'am', 'once', 'again', 'DA', 'addict', 'Just', 'try', 'pulling', 'away', 'Right', 'top', 'let', 'get', 'something', 'chest', 'THINK', 'BATES', 'IS', 'GUILTY', 'Am', 'only', 'one', 'think', 'way', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'late', 'wife', 'character', 'who', 'lived', 'revenge', 'killing', 'only', 'alternative', 'guess', 'could', 'argue', 'was', 'primo', 'act', 'revenge', 'was', 'doing', 'fabulously', 'well', 'Bates', 'Anna', 'revenge', 'wise', 'limitless', 'prospects', 'further', 'success', 'Why', 'end', 'pleasurable', 'experience', 'could', 'watch', 'endlessly', 'unfold', 'was', 'already', 'making', 'absolutely', 'miserable', 'out', 'was', 'suicide', 'think', 'only', 'misstep', 'writers', 'made', 'big', 'plot', 'element', 'season', 'three', 'downstairs', 'Anna', 'still', 'trying', 'exonerate', 'him.Upstairs', 'have', 'wedding', 'Matthew', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'further', 'quarrels', 'leading', 'way', 'altar', 'two', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'staid', 'marriage', 'good', 'Sybil', 'present', 'Tom', 'will', 'be', 'shortly', 'delivering', 'baby', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'lord', 'master', 'abbey', 'again', 'beset', 'sides', 'many', 'mistakes', 'based', 'aristocratic', 'viewpoint', 'world', 'heart', 'prime', 'problem', 'people', 'grew', 'up', 'aristocracy', 'aristocracy', 'precisely', 'what', 'longer', 'needed', 'post', 'world', 'war', 'one', 'England.But', 'best', 'characters', 'are', 'three', 'older', 'women', 'matriarchs', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'dowager', 'countess', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Matthew', 'mother', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'present', 'countess', 'American', 'mother', 'would', 'think', 'dowager', 'countess', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'anachronism', 'future', 'being', 'firmly', 'represented', 'other', 'two', 'matriarchs', 'However', 'power', 'throne', 'Smith', 'incredible', 'always', 'power', 'throne', 'often', 'woman', 'who', 'Smith', 'thus', 'be', 'major', 'delight.As', 'usual', 'am', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'next', 'episode', 'sigh', '..']",N/A

But we still can't escape the never-ending drudgery of poor Edith, who is thwarted at every turn. I sincerely hope the writer gives her a break someday! Just when one possibility of future happiness turns up, Fellowes throws in a plot twist right out of a Bronte novel to further complicate her life. There's also a redundancy and lack of clarity in certain plot twists (such as Anna's sudden realization of Vera Bates' motives, which were obvious to us all last season). But it's always funny, always charming, and always romantic... even if it does make us cry buckets of tears before the season is out. It threatens to take one character from us, only to deviate into two shocking, unexpected deaths in a later episode.As always, the acting is magnificent and this season there's a lot to work with emotionally, from a death to near financial disaster and the arrival of a newborn to Downton. Maggie Smith is given all the best lines but the flirtations between Matthew and Mary are delightful to watch. In fact, there's one sneaked kiss in the first episode that is particularly fun. BUT, frankly, the last two minutes of this series are the most depressing I've ever seen.

I also have seasons 1 and 2 that I purchased directly from the UK which are region free and those disks do not have annoying and time-wasting commercials on them and instead go promptly to the main menu.  This season 3 put out with the PBS logo on it was release here in the US has at least two commercials for PBS - it's like watching the series on television with the commercials.  However, you can fast-forward to the main menu to select the episodes.  However, I will not purchase season 4 when it becomes available from the US/PBS version for the same reason that it will most likely have commercial messages in it.  Seek out the UK version instead if that matters to you. I think it's a bit arrogant on the part of PBS (and other movie studios as well), to insert commercials into a Blu-ray or DVD.  After all, one purchases movies on Blu-ray and DVD not just for the quality and convenience but for the absence of time-wasting and annoying commercials.As for the actual season 3 (and 1 and 2) of Downton Abbey, well, it's ""simply fabulous"" as Thurston Howell III (from the 70's TV series ""Gilligan's Island"", played by Jim Baccus) would say in his Dink accent, and if you've seen seasons 1 and 2 you'll not want to miss season 3.  I can't wait for season 4.  The end of season 3 was simply riveting.One gets a true sense of what it must have been like to be part of a family of Lords around the turn of the 19th century in England and to have been brought up with the attendant privileges of such a station in life there.If I were rating just the production of Downton Abbey it would get a 10 on a scale of 1 to 5 - it's that good; actors, acting, scenery, costumes, dialog, filming, character development, and especially the filming.

To my viewing, she definitely daunts the Dowager, trumping her in audacity in nearly every encounter.  No doubt the financial vulnerability plays a strong part in that. It may be a case of whether you prefer blunt over acidity or vice versa.The attachment between Matthew and Mary was never so poignant as revealed in the night before wedding sequence at Mary's bedroom door.  Matthew is so richly warm as he affirms his love and repeats to Mary the words from Tom Branson that he could not be content in life without her, regardless of their disagreement.  So effective.The mystery still holds concerning Bates, as a darker side is showing up with his cell mate.  Since he has been so insistent in not revealing things to shield others in the past, perhaps that is still the case. I wouldn't be surprised if Anna's probings provide necessary evidence and we find that again, he has been acting in honor by not revealing something that could have cleared him.  As to his cell mate, the pressure of his circumstances could well account for his unwillingness to take anything off someone he doesn't have to.  A lot of good people believe in his character.This episode as seen on PBS severely breaks the smooth transition of story lines previously experienced, making a complete UK edition mandatory.  Hopefully, there will be help in the very rapid moving from one story line to the next, as presently it is a bit of a whiplash at times.  One is trying to digest what was just presented, but is immediately being thrown into another diverse and complicated scenario.  Before, the difference in the broadcast and full version was an abrupt introduction of a character without the lead up in the full edition, but now it is more a hurl from one venue to another, especially in the latter part.It will be very interesting to see how this central theme of change plays out among the parties, along with the various fates hanging in the balance and old scores to be settled.",5,Clash of Cultures,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,2683,"['Never', 'before', 'clash', 'cultures', 'times', 'played', 'integral', 'part', 'family', 'beginning', 'show', 'division', 'willing', 'adjust', 'change', 'staunchly', 'holding', 'old', 'ways', 'even', 'spouses', 'Dear', 'Mrs.', 'Levinson', 'Cora', 'mother', 'here', 'boldly', 'state', 'issue', 'idealists/diehards', 'emerge', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Mr.', 'Carson', 'position', 'sympathetic', 'due', 'attachment', 'characters', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'one', 'defend.The', 'big', 'changes', 'opening', 'Series', '3', 'episode', 'are', 'financial', 'loss', 'family', 'introduction', 'Cora', 'mother', 'coming', 'wedding', 'blunt', 'indomitable', 'personality', 'viewing', 'definitely', 'Dowager', 'trumping', 'audacity', 'nearly', 'encounter', 'doubt', 'financial', 'vulnerability', 'strong', 'part', 'may', 'be', 'case', 'prefer', 'blunt', 'over', 'acidity', 'vice', 'versa.The', 'attachment', 'Matthew', 'Mary', 'was', 'never', 'so', 'poignant', 'revealed', 'night', 'wedding', 'sequence', 'Mary', 'bedroom', 'door', 'Matthew', 'so', 'richly', 'warm', 'love', 'repeats', 'Mary', 'words', 'Tom', 'Branson', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'content', 'life', 'regardless', 'disagreement', 'effective.The', 'mystery', 'still', 'concerning', 'Bates', 'darker', 'side', 'showing', 'up', 'cell', 'mate', 'been', 'so', 'insistent', 'not', 'revealing', 'things', 'shield', 'others', 'past', 'perhaps', 'still', 'case', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Anna', 'probings', 'provide', 'necessary', 'evidence', 'find', 'again', 'been', 'acting', 'honor', 'not', 'revealing', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'cleared', 'cell', 'mate', 'pressure', 'circumstances', 'could', 'well', 'account', 'unwillingness', 'take', 'anything', 'someone', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'good', 'people', 'believe', 'character.This', 'episode', 'seen', 'PBS', 'severely', 'smooth', 'transition', 'story', 'lines', 'previously', 'experienced', 'making', 'complete', 'UK', 'edition', 'mandatory', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'help', 'very', 'rapid', 'moving', 'one', 'story', 'line', 'next', 'presently', 'bit', 'whiplash', 'times', 'One', 'trying', 'digest', 'what', 'was', 'just', 'presented', 'immediately', 'being', 'thrown', 'diverse', 'complicated', 'scenario', 'difference', 'broadcast', 'full', 'version', 'was', 'abrupt', 'introduction', 'character', 'lead', 'up', 'full', 'edition', 'now', 'more', 'hurl', 'one', 'venue', 'especially', 'latter', 'part.It', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'central', 'theme', 'change', 'plays', 'out', 'parties', 'various', 'fates', 'hanging', 'balance', 'old', 'scores', 'be', 'settled']",N/A

193806,ACU94F93TR1T8,1608838137,"D. M. Paine ""Renaissance Man""","[0, 0]","Downton Abbey succeeds where other series have failed because it is intelligently written and compellingly acted. Part of its appeal of course lies in recreating a bygone time that many of us Americans are curious about, like our British brethren. It breathes life into an age of pomp and circumstance, that we may not have realized was as alive as it is here. The Crawley family have for ages lived in splendor, and their servants in a lower station in life, but there's a conscious realization that everyone, the rich and the servants, have a  role to play. Indeed, Carson the head butler is proud of his station, and has no hesitation in enforcing the rules with all the staff under his command. This system works because, at least in this household, the Earl's family care about the staff and their well-being, as part of the social compact that makes everything work.This brings a basic humanity to their lives and enables the stories to bring real flesh and personality to the characters. The romantic but ultimately tragic courtship between Mary Crawley and Matthew Crawley (distant cousins) matters to us not just the fluff of soap opera, but we see their torn inner lives and the reconciliation they make to finally accept and love each other. I think Hugh Bonneville is especially effective as Lord Crawley. A benevolent master who rules but knows much is expected of him, he accepts Bates, a semi-invalid veteran who fought with him in the Boer War, as his new valet despite the infighting it causes with other footmen. At a crucial moment in season three, Lord Crawley graciously cedes operating control of his estate to his son-in-laws, fighting the impulse to feel usurped.Like many serials, Downton Abbey contrives events to conform around it's characters. SPOILER ALERT: it seems to me the only reason to kill off Matthew in a car accident is the actor Dan Stevens was ready to leave the show. Still, these things happen with any long-lived show, and the scripts create plenty enough genuine intrigue and action without it.There is so much more you could say to praise Downton Abbey. It's addictiveness to the viewer (like me) is it makes you care about all the members of the household...plus it packs so much into each episode, you can barely miss half an hour before being completely lost in what's happening next.",5,The utmost in intelligent continuing series - turns the model on its head,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2333,"['Downton', 'Abbey', 'where', 'other', 'series', 'have', 'failed', 'intelligently', 'written', 'compellingly', 'acted', 'Part', 'appeal', 'course', 'lies', 'recreating', 'bygone', 'time', 'many', 'Americans', 'are', 'curious', 'British', 'brethren', 'life', 'age', 'pomp', 'circumstance', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'realized', 'was', 'as', 'alive', 'here', 'Crawley', 'family', 'have', 'ages', 'lived', 'splendor', 'servants', 'lower', 'station', 'life', 'conscious', 'realization', 'everyone', 'rich', 'servants', 'have', 'role', 'play', 'Indeed', 'Carson', 'head', 'butler', 'proud', 'station', 'hesitation', 'enforcing', 'rules', 'staff', 'command', 'system', 'because', 'least', 'household', 'Earl', 'family', 'care', 'staff', 'well-being', 'part', 'social', 'compact', 'everything', 'work.This', 'basic', 'humanity', 'lives', 'stories', 'bring', 'real', 'flesh', 'personality', 'characters', 'romantic', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'courtship', 'Mary', 'Crawley', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'distant', 'cousins', 'matters', 'not', 'just', 'fluff', 'soap', 'opera', 'see', 'torn', 'inner', 'lives', 'reconciliation', 'make', 'finally', 'accept', 'love', 'other', 'think', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'especially', 'effective', 'Lord', 'Crawley', 'benevolent', 'master', 'who', 'rules', 'knows', 'much', 'expected', 'Bates', 'semi-invalid', 'veteran', 'who', 'fought', 'Boer', 'War', 'new', 'valet', 'infighting', 'other', 'footmen', 'crucial', 'moment', 'season', 'three', 'Lord', 'Crawley', 'graciously', 'operating', 'control', 'estate', 'son-in-laws', 'fighting', 'impulse', 'feel', 'usurped.Like', 'many', 'serials', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'events', 'conform', 'characters', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'only', 'reason', 'kill', 'off', 'Matthew', 'car', 'accident', 'actor', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'was', 'ready', 'leave', 'show', 'Still', 'things', 'happen', 'long-lived', 'show', 'scripts', 'create', 'plenty', 'enough', 'genuine', 'intrigue', 'action', 'it.There', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'say', 'praise', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'addictiveness', 'viewer', 'care', 'members', 'household', 'so', 'much', 'episode', 'can', 'barely', 'miss', 'hour', 'being', 'completely', 'lost', 'what', 'happening', 'next']",N/A

I was especially moved by  Mrs. Hughes' storyline since I consider her the most compassionate character at Downton. When she stands framed in the shadows of the corridor and accepts that she may die, it is one of the finest shots of the series. I also loved Carson's surreptitious singing revealing just how much he loves her. Also enjoyable, though brief and thinly portrayed, is Shirley MacLaine's appearance as she brings fresh air to the stodginess of English tradition.Unfortunately, my interest waned after Sybil's moving and unexpected death in Episode Five. As the episodes progressed, Mary, Father Crawley, and Matthew grew increasingly irritating to me. The subplots reintroducing the fallen maid and the battle between Mrs. O'Brien and Thomas were tiresome and repetitive. Bates in prison and out of prison was boring. With the introduction of the silly 18-year old ingenue, the season jumped the shark. Maybe Ted McGinley was unavailable.Lastly, the season ending was dreadful.

I have watched them avidly on PBS and then went out and bought each DVD as they've come out and re-watched them again.  The intersecting stories of the nobility upstairs and the servants downstairs continues to intrique and enthrall.  I love to love some characters and I love to hate some characters, and some of them even switch in my affections over time.Season Three takes place in the early 1920's.  Now that WWI is behind Downton, the estate still isn't safe as they take a hit in their finances and have to come to terms with the idea of modernization.  Mary and Matthew are finally together (yeah!) and their wedding is beautifully done, but Matthew is clearly hopeful of a child (and heir) to be.  Edith loses out on her wedding dreams, but discovers her own voice.  I must say, I have gone from disliking her to liking her in this season.  The same with Ms O'Brien, as she becomes a deeper character who is sorry for her mistakes, but still has that sharp tongue.  While, Thomas...well, what can one say about Thomas.  He will emerge a bit of a dark hero by the end of this season.Not sure what I think about the new character of Rose, a young would-be flapper, but it looks like she will be joining the regular cast, and so far I'm liking her.  Also adored the brief bit with Shirley McLaine as Cora's mother and her sarcastic interaction with the Dowager (Maggie Smith)...what can be better with two fabulous actors like this!  Loved every moment of their conversational banter.The world is changing and Downton is changing with it, despite all the attempts of our favorite grumpy by the book yes M'Lord butler.  None of the characters stay static in this show and no one is safe from an untimely end, which makes the stories not only interesting but really sends you on an emotional rollercoaster.  Just when things look their best and brightest--watch out!Non-character stars of the show include the beautiful 1920's style clothing (bring back feathered and jeweled headbands!), the vintage cars, and Oh My! that wonderful trip to the Scottish Highlands that rounds out the season.

193933,A13TO5TU4A68LD,1608838137,Gryphonisle,"[8, 9]","There was a time,  back in the 1990's, when a BBC miniseries put as much emphasis on historical accuracy as it did on entertainment value, perhaps more.  I remember one such program set in the 1920's that was so slow moving and dull that drying paint would have been more interesting.  Those days are over, and Downton Abbey is not your father's BBC miniseries.  Historical accuracy is left for, well, to quote many speakers at the recent GOP convention,  the fact checkers to decide.  No, one does not see jet contrails over the manor house, or hear Led Zeppelin coming from a maid's room, but characters do utter words and phrases not yet coined.  In one episode, our dear Livinia is (in jest) said to be ""sucking up to"" her mother in law, which would have been a rather disturbing idea, between two adult women in 1919.In such a world, WWI showed up to add drama to the end of the last episode of the first season, and was gone, having taken out only a couple of superfluous characters, by the time we were 2/3 of the way through Season 2, all wounds healed, except on characters marked for dire ends in Season 3.  The Spanish Flu Pandemic (1919) arrived for one episode in Season 2, in order to take out another superfluous character, but just to make sure we understood her intentions, the episode introduced a Ouija board, so she could speak to us from the beyond.  Yep, this is the New BBC miniseries.  No child left behind.So, it was with no little excitement that Downton Abbey Season 3 crossed the atlantic early this year, and with Shirley MacLaine among the cast.Calm down, she only got three episodes, as the writers apparently didn't allow her a fortune big enough to save Downton Abbey, so there wasn't any need to keep her around once that was revealed.  This is not a spoiler.  Besides, it was a strangely subdued, almost sedated MacLaine.  I imagine she had to have shots due to wounds she suffered in the battle with her wardrobe.  For nearly all of her appearances, MacLaine, rather wildly dressed in 1920's gowns for mature women, seems to be getting swallowed whole by her costume, and can barely keep her head out of its throat, and as a result, is restricted to rather gnomic one liners intended to make her (a New York/Newport socialite) the paragon of Democracy, speaking Truth to the wily Old World landed gentry.As if...Anyone who's read Edith Wharton, or seen the movies (""House of Mirth"") knows that American high society was as constricted, if not moreso, as any of the nobles of Europe, and just as class conscious.  MacLaine's character would have been fawning over the Granthams not pushing back.  AND she's Jewish?  You mean the titled families of England were marrying into foreign Jewish fortunes, in an era when anti-Semitism was barely disguised in the US, and some big wigs over there would later openly sympathize with Hitler?Again, cool down big feller, that's for them fact checkers...Yes, this is the topsy turvy world aimed at lightly educated Moderns, whose concepts of history are hazy at best, and who are so complacent in their world view, of the eternal character of the status quo, the Republic, that science is often thought of as merely ""another opinion"".  The New BBC Miniseries is a lot like its PBS cousins, education is but a minor component of its goal.Downton Abbey is pure entertainment in period clothes.

193940,A20FK68BUB1IVA,1608838137,Happy Reader,"[5, 7]","If you haven't seen all of Season 3 and the 2012 Christmas special, called ""A Journey to the Highlands"", you probably don't want spoilers. I am going to give a synopsis of the Special Features, and that's difficult without giving some facts away as to season 3. Two important characters die in two different places on this 3-disc set (I won't say who, but the actor playing the one that dies during the Christmas Special wanted to leave the show). The deaths might make you want to take Julian Fellowes, writer and creator, to task. But then again, having tragedy amidst the joy is what makes ""Downton Abbey"" a really really great show. I have a couple people hooked on ""Downton Abbey"" who have never watched ""Masterpiece Theater"" before!This Season 3 DVD set contains three discs. It DOES have the 2012 Christmas Special. I have received my DVD set, ordered on this page, and it has parts 1 - 9 of Season 3, plus ""A Journey to the Highlands"" and 8 Special Features.DISC 1:Disc 1 has parts 1, 2, and 3 of Season 3 and 1 extra. English subtitles are available.Special Features:1. ""Behind the Drama"" (60 minutes) This is an fabulous overview of the first two seasons, with clips from the two seasons, interviews and rehearsal scenes. What I particularly liked is that it's not just a rehash of the plot lines, it includes why a plot line or character development was important or undertaken. Per the narrator, before WWI, there were 1.4 million people ""in service"" in England. Highclere Castle, ""with more than 50 bedrooms, there was plenty to do."" And plenty of rules, and the hierarchy below stairs was even stricter than above stairs.When a scene takes place upstairs, they are really filmed at Highclere Castle. When below stairs, though, they were filmed on sets at Ealing Studios. That's because though the magnificent upstairs is much the same (except for bathrooms!) now as it was before WWI, the kitchens and downstairs have been modernized.Remember the scene where ""The Turk"" enters Lady Mary's bedroom and she says, ""You and my parents have something in common. You think I am much more of a rebel than I am."" (Which is pretty humorous in itself, given that Mary is most tradition-hide-bound of the sisters.) Julian Fellowes tells us that the whole dead Turkish lover is based on a true story. A friend of his, who owns a Big House, ""came upon a diary of one of his great-aunts, and this whole incident is recorded"".The commentators also touch on the Spanish Flu epidemic, which may have killed up to 50,000,000 people world wide. Most flus are most lethal to the very young and the elderly. I've read that the Spanish Flu, however, was most lethal to healthy adults. It made your immune system go wild, attacking your body as well as the virus. So the healthier your immune system was, the more likely it was going to kill you.DISC 2:Disc 2 has parts 4. 5. 6. and 7 of Season 3. English subtitles are available. There are no special features on this disc.DISC 3:Disc 3 has parts 8 & 9 of Season 3, as well as ""A Journey to the Highlands"" (the 2012 Christmas special) and 7 Special Features. English subtitles are available.Special Features:1. ""Downton in 1920"" (20 minutes) Commentators include Julian Fellowes (writer and creator), Brian Percival (director, episodes 1 & 2), Magi Vaughan (make up & hair designer), Caroline McCall (costume designer), Charmain Adams (production designer), Elizabeth McGovern (plays Cora, Countess of Grantham), Michelle Dockery (plays Lady Mary), Laura Carmichael (plays Lady Edith), Alastair Bruce (historical advisor), Jim Carter (plays Mr. Carson the butler), Lesley Nichol (plays Mrs. Patmore, the cook), Jessica Brown Finlay (plays Lady Sybil), Sophie McShera (plays Daisy Mason, cook assistant), Allen Leech (plays Tom Branson, the chauffeur), Brendan Coyle (plays John Bates), Gareth Neame (executive producer), Shirley MacLaine (plays Martha Levinson, Cora's American mother), Dan Stevens (plays Matthew Crawley), and Pete Gaine (from Motorhouse Hire Ltd, who supplied Matthew's marvelous 1920 car).In Season 3, it's 1920. When we think 1920, we think ""The Roaring Twenties"". But, as Caroline McCall points out, ""I think people's perception of the 20's is very different from 1920.""  Julian Fellowes points out that the Charleston dance craze didn't happen until 1926. The hair and costume designers had to show fashions changing gradually, because it's not as if everyone started dressing like flappers in 1920.The rigid laced-up corsets of before the war, give way to bandeau corsets and breast-flattening bras. Even the men show subtle changes in their suit jackets, etc. Except for Mr. Carson, of course, who continues to wear exactly the same suit he always has.It wasn't just clothing that was changing. As Alastair Bruce says, ""We see this great imperial family gradually alter, as moral conscience takes us on a different path."" Very much the way the Imperial British Empire was altering.2. ""The Wedding of Lady Mary"" (18 minutes) Commentators include many from extra #1, with new ones: Victoria Brooks (head of publicity for ""Downton Abbey""), Liz Turbridge (producer), Matthew 'Sparky' Ellis (location manager), Charmain Adams (production designer), Maggie Harris (resident of Bampton, where the wedding was filmed), Rev. David Lloyd (Vicar of Bampton), Timothy Word (crowd assistant director), Danielle Bennett (second assistant director), Rupert Steggle (crowd costume assistant), Hugh Bonneville (plays Robert, Lord Grantham), Rob James-Collier (plays Thomas Barrow, footman and troublemaker), Chris Croucher (first assistant director), Stephen Sorby (from Above the Line Security) and Joanne Froggatt (plays Anna Bates).Victoria Brooks says, ""It's almost the next royal wedding, dare we say it!"" There were 209 total crew & cast, including the extras, and the paparazzi was wild to get a photo of ""Mary"" in her wedding dress.3. ""The Wedding of Lady Edith"" (25 minutes) Commentators include many who also appear in the first 2 extras, as well as Robert Bathurst (plays Sir Anthony Strallan), Denis Maguire (supporting artist, plays the photographer at the church), David Holt (special effects technician) and Damian Butlin (standby propman).Poor Edith - how many of us think that? Julian Fellowes says, ""Her self-rebuilding will become another part of the story.... The subliminal message, I think, is we must get behind the wheels of our own lives.""We should take a poll. Did Sir Anthony act out of misguided honor or is he just a jerk? And if we don't think he's a jerk, how about Lord Robert's part in this?4. ""The Men of Downton Abbey"" (12 minutes) Commentators appear in the first 3 specials. This focuses on how WWI was the changemaker, whether you were above stairs or below stairs. Hugh Bonneville says, ""After the turmoil of the war, Robert thinks, in a way, that life will return to the way it was before the way. And, of course, it never will.""Alastair Bruce adds, ""People have survived something [in WWI], and they are never going to forget what they've gone through.... It changes their view of what they expect from the world.""5. ""Shirley MacLaine at Downton"" (16 minutes) MacLaine hadn't been watching ""Downton Abbey"" herself, but she had friends who were addicts. It's a sign of how good the show is that it could get a Shirley MacLaine to be in it. Sophie McShera groans, ""I didn't get to meet Shirley MacLaine and I'm so jealous.""Rob James-Collier is excited just talking about the meeting of Shirley Maclaine and Dame Maggie Smith on the show. ""They are going to be epic, they really are. Two actual legends on screen, battling it out. The only thing I can liken it to is DeNiro vs Pacino in ""Heat""!"" (""Heat"" is an American 1995 movie.)6. ""Behind the Scenes: The Cricket Match"" (10 minutes) Many commentators appear before. New ones are Eddie Williams (3rd assistant director), Adam Ghillam (camera operator), Kevin Doyle (plays Molesley, the butler for Mrs. Crawley, Matthew's mother), Ed Speleers (plays Jimmy Kent, new footman), Cora Theobold (plays Ivy Stuart, new kitchen maid), David Evans (director episodes 7 & 8) and Matt Milne (plays Alfred Nugent, footman).The match took three days to shoot. Mr. Carson takes part, and Jim Carter says, ""It's lovely for Carson to be out in his cricket gear. First time in three years I've had a change of clothes."" Only one cast member taking part in the match actually knew how to play cricket. Thanks to stand-ins and clever camera work, you wouldn't know it.7. ""Behind the Scenes: A Journey to the Highlands"" Many familiar commentators, with these new ones: Lily James (plays Lady Rose MacClare), Andy Goddard (director for this episode) and Diana Scrivener (choreographer). For this 2012 Christmas special, cast and crew traveled, for filming, to Inveraray Castle, Scotland, seat of the real Duke of Argyll. Incredibly beautiful scenery, but everybody complains about the outdoor scenes where they were attacked by hordes of midges.For the show, Inveraray stands in for Duneagle Castle, home of Sir Robert's cousin, Hugh 'Shrimpy' MacClare. His 18 year-old daughter, Rose, will, according to Julian Fellowes become a prominent character going forward. The staff that stays home at Downton Abbey aren't forgotten, and the episode shifts back and forth between Scotland and Downton. New romance is in the air for more than one character. Lesley Nichol says she asked Fellowes to give Mrs. Patmore a love interest, and he complied. Lesley says, ""Mr. Tufton has taken over our local shop. He's a bit of a flirty ponce, which shocks her [Mrs. Patmore] sideways, really, because I don't think people flirt with Mrs. Patmore.""Season 4 of ""Downton Abbey"" starts filming in late February 2013.

We've primarily followed the various mystery series but have also enjoyed other offerings.  Downton Abbey has taken their TV productions to new heights in a way that Julian Fellows probably never thought possible, but at the same time a sense of detachment and disappointment has settled in after this season.  l hate to be spiteful but it's slowly evolving into an extremely well produced soap opera.  With the various characters coming and going you get the sense they're trying to keep the storyline alive but too many improbable events add up to hard-to-believe episodes.  This entire series has been the best of the best and I consider it to be the crowning achievement of Brit TV. Some of us, a lot of us, here in America have a serious appetite for this formal English society with all its maneuvering and back biting - regardless of our social emphasis on the everyman here.

193942,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,1608838137,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[4, 4]","Worth every cent in price, every minute in time. A powerful period costume drama (some call a Soap) with historical excellence upstaged by perfection in acting. It's the ""Roots"" of historical family drama for the 21st century. You'll drool your champagne over locations, costumes, props, and sets.AND IT'S TO CONTINUE FOR A 4th SEASON. The biggest question is not will it maintain the UK and US growing following, but will it contain Matthew Crowley (Dan Stevens). But he's at least back doing his best and wedding Mary (Michelle Dockery) and will take over the realm of Downton Abbey, even though Earl Robert (Hugh Bonneville) has bungled the finances, always a plot among the early English wealthy families.Yes, much of the former cast is back, joined with the American upstart actress Shirley MacLaine playing Cora's (Elizabeth McGovern) American mother. With this huge star going against the impeccable delivery of lines from Dowager Violet (Maggie Smith), the excitement and cast excellence remains. Combined, these 2 drive a thread of sharp-spark delight through this third series. She's welcomed by cast and viewers. Past issues, like imprisonment, the Bates, Anna & John, also continues in romance/tragedy form.Although the UK gets first peeks, it is America that is driving worldwide success. It will continue in some form, and at the peak of seductive drama.To Downton Abbey fans, it is just ""family"" being viewed.The 1920 English lifestyle of the aristocrat and their home staff has never been presented better since Upstairs, Downstairs. Only time will tell if Downton Abbey fans will drive this series beyond the regal success of U,D. I suspect they will. It's powerful writing coming from the pen of Julian Fellowes, and perhaps will end only at his decision. The writing behind the Abbey is as deliciously alluring toward characters as Catherine Cookson's work. Already the public demands more, I and my wife included. She nearly wore out season 2 DVDs and will do likewise to Season 3. We'll order Season 4 as soon as the listing appears.SUBTITLED.Not a rental. It's a MUST OWN.

193944,A18FFOY1FWG5NT,1608838137,Hayat,"[9, 13]","Series 3 was a huge disappointment to me for several reasons.  The stories did not flow as nicely as Series 1 and 2.  For instance, the storyline about Matthew's indecision about taking Reggie Swire's fortune was a total waste of time.  It added nothing to the series and it only served to show Mary's ugly side.  I also didn't understand why some of the characters' personalities changed.  For instance, Lord Grantham suddenly became an incompetent loser who couldn't seem to hold things together. Then we have two new footmen and Cousin Rose who were awful additions.  All of the stories involving the two footmen and Rose seemed to be written in a hurry and thrown in willy nilly and again did not add anything to the continuing saga of Downton Abbey.  And for all the hype about Shirley Maclaine being added to the cast and her interaction with Maggie Smith's character, that was a total bust.  Shirley Maclaine's acting was awful and her role was so small that she could have phoned it in.  The so-called ""brilliant"" exchanges with Maggie Smith never materialized.  And what happened to Cora?  They should have killed off her character when she had the Spanish flu because all she does is walk through the scenes with that silly smile and her head lowered.  The only time she showed any emotion was when Lady Sybil died.  Other than that she does nothing useful and surprisingly shows very little interest in Sybil's baby.  Not once did she hold the baby.  Branson is another character who underwent a huge personality change.  He became a robot.  He needs to ride off into the sunset with his daughter.  The deaths of two main characters did not bother me so much as the poor script.  It appears to me that Fellowes has gotten bored with Downton or maybe his mind has been too much on the American program he is making.  As I understand it, other writers will be making the future scripts and that's usually not a good thing.  I enjoyed the first two series of Downton Abbey immensely, but Series 3 has turned me off so much that I don't think I will be watching it in the future.",1,Downton Abbey 3 is a disappointment,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,2086,"['Series', '3', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'several', 'reasons', 'stories', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'as', 'nicely', 'Series', '1', '2', 'instance', 'storyline', 'Matthew', 'indecision', 'taking', 'Reggie', 'Swire', 'fortune', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'added', 'nothing', 'series', 'only', 'served', 'show', 'Mary', 'ugly', 'side', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'characters', 'personalities', 'changed', 'instance', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'suddenly', 'became', 'incompetent', 'loser', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hold', 'things', 'together', 'Then', 'have', 'two', 'new', 'footmen', 'Cousin', 'Rose', 'who', 'were', 'awful', 'additions', 'stories', 'involving', 'two', 'footmen', 'Rose', 'seemed', 'be', 'written', 'hurry', 'thrown', 'willy', 'nilly', 'again', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'continuing', 'saga', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'hype', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'being', 'added', 'cast', 'interaction', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'character', 'was', 'total', 'bust', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'acting', 'was', 'awful', 'role', 'was', 'so', 'small', 'could', 'have', 'phoned', 'so-called', 'brilliant', 'exchanges', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'never', 'materialized', 'what', 'happened', 'Cora', 'should', 'have', 'killed', 'off', 'character', 'when', 'had', 'Spanish', 'flu', 'walk', 'scenes', 'silly', 'smile', 'head', 'lowered', 'only', 'time', 'showed', 'emotion', 'was', 'when', 'Lady', 'Sybil', 'died', 'Other', 'nothing', 'useful', 'surprisingly', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'Sybil', 'baby', 'Not', 'once', 'did', 'hold', 'baby', 'Branson', 'character', 'who', 'underwent', 'huge', 'personality', 'change', 'became', 'robot', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'daughter', 'deaths', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'so', 'much', 'poor', 'script', 'Fellowes', 'gotten', 'bored', 'Downton', 'maybe', 'mind', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'American', 'program', 'making', 'understand', 'other', 'writers', 'will', 'be', 'making', 'future', 'scripts', 'usually', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'immensely', 'Series', '3', 'turned', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'future']",N/A

The heir apparent Matthew Crawley has wedded his cousin Mary, and the Crawley clan is more than ever ensconced in their way of life.  World War I and the ravages of Influenza are over, and Downton Abbey has returned to its normal and happy state of not giving a rat's fart about the rest of the world.  So it's imperative that the show invents/fabricates new tensions and conflicts to keep the slow inexorable train that is the Downton Abbey plotline moving.The major conflict in Season 3 is tradition vs. modernity, the go-to conflict in period dramas when it's clear audiences have little patience for real issues and problems.  The heir and de facto owner of Downton Abbey Matthew Crawley is intent on importing modern business and farming practices to make Downton Abbey self-sustainable, whereas the patriarch Robert Crawley is upset that his tenants may thrown at the mercy of the market.  But apparently Matthew is not at all happy with the Crawley tradition of financially ruining the estate and therefore forced to happily pursue beautiful American heiresses.  Robert then responds that wise investments can save good tranditions -- isn't Ponzi a good investment?The appeal of Downton Abbey is not in its writing (which is lazy and self-indulgent) or in its acting (Elizabeth McGovern is apparently only capable of an expression that's half-chagrin and half-smile -- stop taking that Botox, Elizabeth!).

The excellent cast, fine writing, and the wonderful sets and costumes make it a ""Don't Miss"" for me.  In Season 3 the noble Crawley family and their servants at Downton Abbey, having survived the vissitudes of World War I more or less intact, are faced with new economic and social pressures.  The world is changing, and the path is no longer automatically smoothed for bearers of noble titles and distinguished lineages.The Earl of Grantham gets things off to a rough start by mismanaging his wife Cora's wealth so badly that he loses it all and faces having to sell Downton Abbey.  His cousin, heir, and new son-in-law Matthew Crawley manages to sort things out in the end, but it's only the beginning. The Earl's daughters Mary (now married to Matthew at last), Edith, and Sybil all continue to have romantic ups and downs, while the Dowager Countess finds her place as Queen of Downton challenged by the arrival of Martha Levinson, the American mother of Lady Grantham. Below stairs the staff continues to soldier on, beset by scandal and romantic turmoils of their own. Eventually tragedy strikes both below and above stairs, leaving plenty of loose ends and questions that will lead to a Season 4 (and who knows how many more?)The fine cast headlined by Hugh Bonneville, Maggie Smith, Michelle Dockery, Penelope Wilton, and Jim Carter among many others has some stellar additions, most notably Shirley MacLaine.

The class differences of upstairs and downstairs is so convincingly portrayed by all the characters. You become invested in the plot, and feel they are some how your own family.The breathtaking historical accuracy to costumes, locations and English countryside alone is well worth tuning in for.Maggie Smith is hysterical with her witty banter as Violet, and I love all the characters.As a gay male myself, it is refreshing to see the development of Thomas Barrow's character played by Robert James Collier.

The writing is fine and consistent, even when external events (actors wanting to depart at the end of their contracts) force storylines.  Thus, we lose some loved characters, but gain new ones.I often find British dramas to be slow going and over-burdoned with heavy dialogue.  This one, however, bucks that trend.

It makes me glad that I am not nearly counted as one of them.  They would never sit down to eat pizza or spaghetti or any other down home meal.  Fried chicken would never be seen nor would cheese steak sandwiches ever be on their menu.  The working people living downstairs work their derriere's off to make upstairs people enjoy their lives.  Personally I enjoy a good pizza with a side of Bud and at times a cheese steak with fried onions is heavenly.  I am not rich by any means and after seeing how the ultra rich live I am glad I am not one.  The show is a study of human nature.  How the workers are charged with taking care of the ladies or the gentlemen.  They don't even have to dress themselves for their maids and butlers are in charge of making sure the Lords and Ladies are dress in clean good fitting clothes.  The show take place in the early 1900s in England.  All that said I have thoroughly enjoyed  every episode .  I am only sorry that Amazon does not have more seasons to offer to their prime members.

There is enough continuity so you can enter the Downtown world each week and feel at home, and enough novelty in characters and situations to keep it from becoming stale.Season 3 brims with energy.  Shirley McLaine is believable as Lord Grantham's mother-in-law from America and plays her role with dash and panache.  It would be easy to be too campy in that role, but that is avoided.

194252,AOCVPRFNS2IKN,1608838137,Lover of English,"[1, 1]","Update: I was considering buying this season a second time.  I originally bought it in November 2012 when it became available in the U.K. and then was very angry when I watched it on PBS in January 2013 to find that there were many additional scenes in Episodes 3, 4, 5 & 6 being shown on PBS.  I felt cheated. However, after reading several comments on one of the reviews here it appears that this DVD offering is no better than that I purchased from Amazon.com/uk.  Why there should be additional scenes shown on PBS and not included in the DVD versions is a mystery but many, many viewers are now aware of this discrepancy  and hopefully it will not happen again as the producers go forward with Season 4.This marvelous series gets better and better.  The guiding spirit that makes this production so much more wonderful than others is the fact that the creator, Julian Fellows, seems to have a benevolent view of life.  I haven't encountered this view since I last read the Brother Cadfael mysteries by Elllis Peters (Edith Pargeter).  Fellows has decided to show people at their very best - a most unusual approach to drama.  I think that this is the reason for Downton Abbey's world-wide success.  Dramatic contrast, which is necessary to keep our interest riveted on the characters, means that the Crawley family will continue to encounter adversity, but it is the way that they pull together that makes us care about them so deeply.  I received Season 3 about mid-November and have watched it every day since then.  It is glorious.I do have to complain that Fellows has gone off the rails once again (cf. the trial of John Bates) in the scene where Tom Branson is allegedly given a drink that makes him act oddly.  In fact: Branson, talking with Larry Gray, puts his cocktail glass down and walks away.  Larry puts something in Tom's glass.  Immediately thereafter dinner is announced and they all go in to dinner.  At that time, with before -dinner cocktails being a very new  phenomenon, people did not take their cocktails into dinner.  It's not like today when people are in a restaurant and take their cocktails from the bar to the dining room.  At that time wine was served with every course and everyone would have left their cocktails in the drawing room.  There was, therefore, no opportunity  for Tom to drink the doctored cocktail.  I think it is insulting that Fellows assumes that his viewers will not recognize the impossibility of these scenes.  The trial scenes were outrageous since there was no possible way for the prosecuting attorney to have knowledge of the events that Mrs. Hughes and Miss O'Brian were forced to testify to.  In Season 3 I was delighted to see that the resolution of Bates's situation was well thought out - logically and rationally and totally in character for everyone, so Julian Fellows can stay within the bounds of the possible when he wants to.  I wish he wanted to more often.  Why he allows his near-perfect series to be marred by these digressions into the impossible is a mystery to me.",5,Glorious series continues,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,3044,"['Update', 'was', 'considering', 'buying', 'season', 'second', 'time', 'originally', 'bought', 'November', '2012', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'U.K.', 'then', 'was', 'very', 'angry', 'when', 'watched', 'PBS', 'January', '2013', 'find', 'were', 'many', 'additional', 'scenes', 'Episodes', '3', '4', '5', '6', 'being', 'shown', 'PBS', 'felt', 'cheated', 'However', 'reading', 'several', 'comments', 'one', 'reviews', 'here', 'DVD', 'offering', 'better', 'purchased', 'Amazon.com/uk', 'Why', 'should', 'be', 'additional', 'scenes', 'shown', 'PBS', 'not', 'included', 'DVD', 'versions', 'mystery', 'many', 'many', 'viewers', 'are', 'now', 'aware', 'discrepancy', 'hopefully', 'will', 'not', 'happen', 'again', 'producers', 'go', 'forward', 'Season', '4.This', 'marvelous', 'series', 'better', 'better', 'guiding', 'spirit', 'production', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'wonderful', 'others', 'fact', 'creator', 'Julian', 'Fellows', 'have', 'benevolent', 'view', 'life', 'have', ""n't"", 'encountered', 'view', 'last', 'read', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'mysteries', 'Elllis', 'Peters', 'Edith', 'Pargeter', 'Fellows', 'decided', 'show', 'people', 'very', 'best', 'most', 'unusual', 'approach', 'drama', 'think', 'reason', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'world-wide', 'success', 'Dramatic', 'contrast', 'necessary', 'keep', 'interest', 'riveted', 'characters', 'Crawley', 'family', 'will', 'continue', 'encounter', 'adversity', 'way', 'pull', 'together', 'care', 'so', 'deeply', 'received', 'Season', '3', 'mid-November', 'have', 'watched', 'day', 'then', 'glorious.I', 'do', 'have', 'complain', 'Fellows', 'gone', 'off', 'rails', 'once', 'again', 'cf', 'trial', 'John', 'Bates', 'scene', 'where', 'Tom', 'Branson', 'allegedly', 'given', 'drink', 'act', 'oddly', 'fact', 'Branson', 'talking', 'Larry', 'Gray', 'cocktail', 'glass', 'down', 'walks', 'away', 'Larry', 'something', 'Tom', 'glass', 'Immediately', 'thereafter', 'dinner', 'announced', 'go', 'dinner', 'time', '-dinner', 'cocktails', 'being', 'very', 'new', 'phenomenon', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'cocktails', 'dinner', 'not', 'like', 'today', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'restaurant', 'take', 'cocktails', 'bar', 'dining', 'room', 'time', 'wine', 'was', 'served', 'course', 'everyone', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'cocktails', 'drawing', 'room', 'was', 'therefore', 'opportunity', 'Tom', 'drink', 'doctored', 'cocktail', 'think', 'insulting', 'Fellows', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'recognize', 'impossibility', 'scenes', 'trial', 'scenes', 'were', 'outrageous', 'was', 'possible', 'way', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'have', 'knowledge', 'events', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'Miss', ""O'Brian"", 'were', 'forced', 'testify', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'resolution', 'Bates', 'situation', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'logically', 'rationally', 'totally', 'character', 'everyone', 'so', 'Julian', 'Fellows', 'can', 'stay', 'bounds', 'possible', 'when', 'wish', 'wanted', 'more', 'often', 'Why', 'near-perfect', 'series', 'be', 'marred', 'digressions', 'impossible', 'mystery']",N/A

The clothing is exceptional as well as the picturesque scenery and castles. The automobiles are quite elegant & proper for the times.. I've grown to love the downstairs help as much as the kind & caring upstairs rich family. Love how the family has a English point of view that sometimes fights the American side that is shown in the Abbey's mother as well as her mother. Maggie Smith is quite a dame to watch. Her expressions & pauses just add to the very prim & proper English style. With the addition of Shirley Maclaine as the American material grandmother, I can laugh at &#34;our&#34; differences to that of the Abbey's inhabitants, whether downstairs help or upstairs upper class.I can't wait until season 4 commences in January!

194334,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,1608838137,Melissa Niksic,"[1, 1]","""Downton Abbey"" is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I am giving this season four stars because I am super critical. I feel like this season, while I still enjoyed it enormously and it is far better than pretty much anything else on television, was super predictable and contrived. I am not going to post any spoilers, because the emotional impact of this season packs quite a punch and everyone deserves to enjoy that in full without being spoilers. My main issues are that, for example, the final event that happens at the very end of the bonus/Christmas episode is something that both my husband and I predicted right down to the letter...and we predicted it during the second episode. That's how much obvious foreshadowing I think there is in the various plots this year, which is a bummer. Sometimes the storylines are so obvious, the dialogue so contrived, that it just takes away from my enjoyment of the show as a whole.Another big disappointment--HUGE--is Shirley MacLaine's character. When I found out she would be joining the show, I was thrilled. ALl I pictures was Shirley and Maggie Smith trading zingers back and forth with a vengeance. Sadly, Shirley's role this season is pretty brief, and her character is much more watered-down than I ever imagined. I am stunned that her talents were not put to better use, and that more effort wasn't put into giving her a more dynamic character. It wasn't a bad character or a bad performance, but it wasn't at all up to par with what I was expecting. I think there was a huge missed opportunity here.That is NOT to say that this is a bad season at all. It's not. It's fabulous and I enjoyed every second of it (well, except the horribly depressing parts, and I am warning you all, there are plenty of those). There are some great storylines, many surprises, and so much emotion. In terms of each character's individual stories, I think Season 3 has been the best season by far, at least as far as individual character development goes.

Lady Mary continues to be headstrong and even takes a stand against her mother when Downton's future seems doomed, offering a glimpse of just how deeply English tradition is ingrained in some of the Granthams despite a seemingly hopeless future for their privileged way of life. Lady Judith's husband finds an unexpected ally among the blue-bloods when he returns for Mary's wedding. Things take an ugly turn between former allied trouble makers downstairs and keeps the suspense up between O'Brien and the duplicitous footman.she once plotted with to wreak troubles amid those in service as well as the Grantham family.

The saga of an aristocratic British family in the years just before and after the first World War, it's a gorgeous look at the fashions, morals, social distinctions and events of the era. Sometimes it's a little overwrought, but when you're watching, you get so caught up, it's all good.  Season one introduced us to The Earl of Grantham, his wife and mother, his three daughters, the various servants, and Matthew Crawley, the new heir to the estate. Season two revealed the on again off again love affair between Matthew and Daughter Mary. Season 3 was even better and kept us enthralled with what those Crawleys were up to now. We were happy in our little fool's paradise...until that last episode.Matthew Crawley is like one of those Good News/Bad News jokes.  Downton Abbey is entailed. That means it can only be inherited by the closest living male relative to the current owner.  That's good news for Matthew...turns out, he's the only living heir.  The bad news? The family thinks he's a dork.  The good news, they have a beautiful daughter named Mary. Matthew likes her. A lot. Bad news? She thinks he's a major dork.  Good News: She suddenly has a change of heart. Bad news? Because if she marries Matthew, the state passes to her son and stays in the family. Good News, she changes her mind Bad news: It's too late, Matthew has met someone else even though he still loves Mary.It goes on and on and on this way. WWI intervenes and poor Matthew is MIA and then found. Twice. He's killed in action at least once, but VOILA! it's a mistake. He's fine. Ooops, no, he's seriously wounded. But he recovers. One problem gets settled and another appears.  The estate is bankrupt and then a timely inheritance makes it solvent again. Finally, in Season 3, all the problems seem to be sorting themselves out and despite one heart-breaking family tragedy, we are smiling through our tears. Watching that final Season 3 episode, we are lulled into a false sense of security...and that's when the writers stick a shiv into our hearts.Not fair. Not nice and not fair. I would be devastated, but I have one desperate hope left.  Matthew has been put through the wringer for all 3 seasons and he just keeps coming back, so i have my fingers crossed that this is going to be fixed in Season 4.  Even if the writers have to come up with a ""Dallas"" like dream ending. I don't care I just want them to fix it.",5,Why Why Why?,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,2573,"['Warning', 'minefield', 'Spoilers', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'addictive', 'especially', 'opt', 'Britisn', 'version', 'not', 'somewhat', 'dumbed', 'version', 'edited', 'American', 'tastes', 'saga', 'aristocratic', 'British', 'family', 'years', 'just', 'before', 'first', 'World', 'War', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'fashions', 'morals', 'social', 'distinctions', 'events', 'era', 'little', 'overwrought', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'get', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'good', 'Season', 'one', 'introduced', 'Earl', 'Grantham', 'wife', 'mother', 'three', 'daughters', 'various', 'servants', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'new', 'heir', 'estate', 'Season', 'two', 'revealed', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'love', 'affair', 'Matthew', 'Daughter', 'Mary', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'kept', 'enthralled', 'what', 'Crawleys', 'were', 'up', 'now', 'were', 'happy', 'little', 'fool', 'paradise', 'last', 'episode.Matthew', 'Crawley', 'one', 'Good', 'News/Bad', 'News', 'jokes', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'entailed', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'inherited', 'closest', 'living', 'male', 'relative', 'current', 'owner', 'good', 'news', 'Matthew', 'out', 'only', 'living', 'heir', 'bad', 'news', 'family', 'dork', 'good', 'news', 'have', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'named', 'Mary', 'Matthew', 'lot', 'Bad', 'news', 'major', 'dork', 'Good', 'News', 'suddenly', 'change', 'heart', 'Bad', 'news', 'Matthew', 'state', 'passes', 'son', 'stays', 'family', 'Good', 'News', 'mind', 'Bad', 'news', 'too', 'late', 'Matthew', 'met', 'someone', 'else', 'even', 'still', 'Mary.It', 'way', 'WWI', 'intervenes', 'poor', 'Matthew', 'MIA', 'then', 'found', 'Twice', 'killed', 'action', 'least', 'once', 'VOILA', 'mistake', 'fine', 'Ooops', 'no', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'One', 'problem', 'settled', 'estate', 'bankrupt', 'then', 'timely', 'inheritance', 'solvent', 'again', 'Finally', 'Season', '3', 'problems', 'seem', 'be', 'sorting', 'one', 'heart-breaking', 'family', 'tragedy', 'are', 'smiling', 'tears', 'Watching', 'final', 'Season', '3', 'episode', 'are', 'lulled', 'false', 'sense', 'security', 'when', 'writers', 'stick', 'shiv', 'hearts.Not', 'fair', 'Not', 'nice', 'not', 'fair', 'would', 'be', 'devastated', 'have', 'one', 'desperate', 'hope', 'left', 'Matthew', 'been', 'put', 'wringer', '3', 'seasons', 'just', 'coming', 'back', 'i', 'have', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'going', 'be', 'fixed', 'Season', '4', 'Even', 'writers', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'Dallas', 'dream', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'just', 'want', 'fix']",N/A

The writers just do what they feel like at the moment.OK, here goes.  I've watched every single episode of the first three seasons of Downton Abbey (some of them twice), and I'm here to tell you it's basically pure junk. The plot(s) are hokey beyond imagining: one daughter runs off with the chauffer (a radical Irish socialist to boot), another loses her virginity to a Turk who dies during the encounter, a third is jilted at the alter by an old one-armed man, a lame valet goes to prison for murdering his wife, etc.  During the second season Matthew's fiancee conveniently dies and he is miraculously cured of his inability to walk so he can marry his true love.  These are just a few examples of the silliness of the show. The portrait of the British aristocracy (particularly the Duke or whatever he is) is unbelievable (only the incomparable Maggie Smith makes them endurable). After the penultimate episode of Season 3 I thought (hoped) it was over. Everything seemed resolved. Bates was back, married, in a new home; the gay valet was going to stay, the Irish chauffer and his baby were moving into the house, etc. But wait . . . there's more. Matthew is dead and a whole new set of questions (and facile ansers) remains.As I say, all this gives a rich new meaning to ""hokey.""

It's an award-winning ITV series penned by Julian Fellowes that has evolved a great deal in the last three years. Praised for its first season but earning lackluster reviews in its second (which I attribute to the time frame), the series returns for a stronger, but emotionally driven third season. One that wouldn't be the 'Downton Abbey' we know and love without some fun and soapy drama - and there's plenty of it!It has been many months since the house of Downton Abbey has seen such life and happiness as that of the impending wedding of Mary (Michelle Dockery) and Matthew (Dan Stevens). Butler and stickler of the rules, Carson (Jim Carter) couldn't be more proud if Mary were his own daughter - always his favorite, Carson would do anything to see to it that Mary and his employer Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonnville) receive only the best care and are never subject to scandal. Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) and the family couldn't be more delighted that Mary and Matthew are finally marrying after a tumultuous relationship and for once, Cora and her mother-in-law, Countess Grantham (Maggie Smith) agree on something. The big day isn't complete without the arrival of Cora's opinionated - and bossy -American mother (Shirley McClain)... and Cora's youngest daughter, Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay) who created waves of conflict in the family when she married the chauffer, Tom (Allen Leech). Accepting a tradesman for a son-in-law soon becomes second to the dreams of Edith (Laura Carmichael) becoming a journalist, the arrival of new downstairs staff, Thomas' shenanigans, scary possibilities for Mrs. Hughes (Phyillis Logan)... and financial woes for Downton Abbey.What makes this series such a success is its characters. It's been said time and again by reviewer after reviewer. And it's true; the foundation would simply crumble without them. It's the things that we laugh, cry and bite our nails over that makes Downton so distinctively what it is. Three years in, that is still the key to why this is so darn successful and I am pleased to say that even entering an age of renowned promiscuity - the ""roaring 20's,"" Fellowes still retains the charm and (mostly) wholesome ideal. Marvels galore - from new characters and old favorites... to inventive new costuming! -will delight devoted fans of this popular British-originated and now ""imported"" American series.Leaving off from the second season, certain character's fates were left in tatters and in jeopardy, and others lives were finally getting on the track of happily-ever-after after much angst. I'll confess to reading spoilers and gossiping about this in anticipation with a couple of friends so I wasn't unprepared for anything that was happening in the stately halls of my favorite British mansion. There is plenty of soapy drama mixing in with tears... and lest you despair, never fear, there are events that make us smile and our hearts inexplicably happy. Edith's happiness takes a turn, ripping a page straight from a Bronte novel. Thomas and O'Brien continue to scheme directing hate towards each other. Lest you think some fan favorites are absent, you'd be mistaken; Daisy, Anna and Bates are still a familiar presence, as is Isobel and even the re-appearance of the fallen maid, Ethel. New faces also become a fixture at Downton between a besotted new kitchen maid and a vain footman. That alone creates loads of tension.Some of the highlights consist of meeting Cora's mother (she and Violet are a riot together - like she and Isobel, they are constantly at odds) as well as the characters who have evolved into something more mature and if possible, more wonderful. Being something of a romantic, I wish Matthew and Mary had shared more intimate moments of flirting and stolen kisses but being the proper British couple they are, that is kept to a minimum but seriously, as my mother said, ""even when they're fighting, they are cute!"" She is so right! Their interaction is darling and all too rare. Everything from the motor cars to the scenery, the grandeur of a London club to the costuming is gorgeous and beautifully puts us in mind of this era. I love the production for that reason alone if nothing else though there are many other reasons. With rumors that some of the main cast (nooo! Please say it isn't so!) is leaving and no report that there will be a fourth series (yet!), I can accept this ending but am wishing that we will be granted another series beyond just the upcoming Christmas special. So many moments were precious (including the acceptance of Tom - loved Robert's shifting attitude) and memories were made that we will no doubt cherish all of which is carried by the phenomenal cast and the emotional, witty script.

And the fact they have so many characters and they are able to make them interesting and real, and keep up with it all is impressive. And such wonderful characters, that I never cried so hard in my life for a show or film as I did when Sybil died. And it takes a lot for me to do so. I had to watch the whole thing with a box of tissues. In fact I was so distressed that they killed one of my favorite characters that I wasn't sure if I could continue watching. But couldn't stay away, I had to continue it's that good. And unfortunately it looks like I'm in for a lot more tears but I'm hooked.

She has no depth and is very stereotypical of teenagers today! And she's coming to Downton to replace Sybil I guess. Just dumb. And then there's poor Lady Edith or should we now call her Jane Eyre? Her man is horribly chained to a lunatic wife he cannot divorce; why steal a plot line that was already done and done better to boot? And now we are manipulated into feeling sorry for Thomas when most of the series, he was always plotting and evil, not being heroic and humble.To top it all off, one of my 'favorite to look at' characters gets killed off. I find, after reading a few of these reviews, that he wanted to leave the show. Too bad, but geez, aren't actors signed onto long term series with long term contracts? I also hated when Sybil died, but this was just too much. I guess when there is happiness, it's just gotta be ripped away. And really, enough of Anna and Mr. Bates. They just bug me SO much.

If you get tired of the splendor of Downton, you are wisked away to Scotland and that completely different culture and landscape. You really get a sense of time flying by (modernity) and also standing still (tradition). It is such an interesting contrast. If you liked the first two, you will probably like this one.

194739,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,1608838137,The Wingchair Critic,"[2, 3]","'Downton Abbey' (2010-present) is the outstanding period drama and British-American production created by Julian Fellowes.Unlike AMC's 'Mad Men,' which also took America by storm a little at a time, and also largely by word of mouth, 'Downton Abbey,' which considers Edwardian England, the Great War, and its aftermath, was predominantly created by native British citizens, and carefully analyzes the period it covers without wholly trashing it, as 'Mad Men' subtly and unsubtly does 1960s America on an episode-by-episode basis.In an era of exploitive programs like 'American Horror Story,' which is as extreme as anything ever produced for television, and which regularly traffics in horrific amputations, sadomasochism, genetic deformity, and torture, it is wonderful to discover a series like 'Downton Abbey,' which proves, among other points, that adults everywhere are absolutely starved for intelligent, ethical, and mature dramatic fare, such as was regularly produced in decades past on both sides of the Atlantic, especially in film.Opening in 1912, 'Downton Abbey' is the story of the aristocratic and genuinely noble Crawley family, who live in contented luxury at Downton Abbey, their immense Yorkshire estate, and of the lives of their multitude of servants, who the Crawleys treat with humanity, decency, and respect.Their fairly idyllic lifestyle is rattled by the loss of the family heirs on the Titanic, and then the coming of the Great War, which turns Britain and its social traditions upside down in a thousand painful ways.What makes 'Downton Abbey' almost radical in this age is that it refuses to denigrate the Edwardian aristocracy it examines. While both Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Maggie Smith) and American-born Lady Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern) are initially shown to be somewhat priggish and short-sighted, one of the themes of the program is the dual nature of most men.Thus, homosexual footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) is, along with lady's maid Miss O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran), initially something of a villain, but as the series progresses, even sociopathic Thomas is shown to have, or to develop, a good side.Likewise, overlooked middle sister Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) foolishly betrays her elder sister, Mary (Michelle Dockery), but this action is shown to be a lapse, if still a serious one, in an otherwise good personal character.As a whole, 'Downton Abbey' believes in the predominantly ethical and decent nature of man. As such, it depicts both the aristocrat and the 'common' working man, such as Christ figure and valet John Bates (Brendon Coyle, whose performance dominates the first season), as capable of integrity, empathy, courage, nobility of purpose, and basic human goodness in all its forms.It is this vision of mankind that gives 'Downton Abbey' its power.Though the series has the occasional weak treatment of a plot thread--such as dignified butler Carson (Jim Carter) being revealed to have once been a vaudeville performer or the rather unconvincing return of an heir thought dead, 'Downton Abbey' usually steers clear, not of soap opera cliches unfortunately, but of the standard melodramatic treatment of them when they do appear.For 'Downton Abbey' to continue to thrive creatively, however, the writing has to remain focused primarily on the historical period, and continue to provide viewers with 'a window into the past' instead of becoming bogged down too heavily in the lives of the characters themselves. By Season Three, for example, the lame and long-suffering Bates has been put through so many sensational reversals of fortune that such events no longer seem very credible, and audience sympathy for the character wanes considerably.In Season One, the various characters appeared largely to represent objective principles as much as they were presented as three-dimensional human beings; in the opening episodes of Season Three, however, the same characters are instead depicted strictly in human terms, and the writing is far more self-conscious in every respect. Thankfully, by the fifth episode and following, the writing is the best it has been since the first season.'Downton Abbey,' in its worldwide success, should not be playing to its audience, but going its own way and forcing the viewer to make all the effort necessary to follow it.Still, 'Downton Abbey' remains outstanding on almost every level, from the writing, cinematography, set design, costuming, and score to the brilliant acting by Hugh Bonneville as the Crawley family patriarch, Dan Stevens as heir presumptive Matthew Crawley and Smith, McGovern, Dockery, Coyle, and well over a dozen others, 'Downton Abbey' sets a new standard for 21st century television, and, by extension, asks us to reconsider the lives we lead and the society we support today.All students of Edwardian England, of Rupert Brooke, Vita Sackville-West, Kenneth Grahame, J. M. Barrie, the Sitwells and others will admire and deeply appreciate this intelligent, thoughtful, and moving series.",5,Remembering Civility,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,5030,"[""'Downton"", 'Abbey',

Since each episode in the series builds in dramatic power, we have relished seeing Downton Abbey in its entirety, while we await the start of season 4.My wife and i began watching DA during its first season on PBS, and were immediately hooked.  Excellent, witty dialogue; great direction and pacing; gorgeous settings in the house and grounds - I could go on and on.  Season three continues the outstanding performance.  If you liked the first two series, you'll be equally enthralled by the third.If you're new to the series, then, by all means, start at the beginning - the first season sets the stage where you get to know the characters, and watch as they develop through the years.  This is not a series carried by one or two stars, such as Maggie Smith or Hugh Bonneville, but devotes sufficient time to a wealth of characters, developing their story lines, drawing the viewer into almost a family relationship.After watching most of the third season last year on PBS, we were so affected, we bought the entire 1970s series of &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; from Amazon and watched it.

Excellent acting, superior dress and sets.It was hard losing Sybil, but this year the show loses one of it's main characters. As popular and excellent as this show is, I'm not sure if the series is still following the book. The second major kill-off was because the actor wanted to leave the series.  I went around two days moping because of that lol.I would like to mention that I hope someone else speaks up if they're having problems with the Blu-Ray UK version.The first two shipments from Amazon, disk 1 didn't work but disk 2 and 3 did.The last shipment, all three disks didn't work in our player. We have a large Blu Ray collection and they all play fine. I might also mention I tried a second machine and it didn't work in that one too.On the second set, I called in and had the misfortune of having to talk to someone from India who spoke pigeon English. When I explained to her what happened, she asked me to describe my DVD player and give her the model number! Then she said there would be an ""investigation"" into the claims I made of the faulty disks. My God! I am not trying to steal anything I want working disks! Then she read that the DVDs are for region 1/A for North America, and asked me if United States was in North America.Luckily, I used the automated online return/replace form and Amazon graciously sent out the third set. Sadly, also defective. We are now going to buy from Walmart or PBS because we know it will be a different batch of prints. We have been loyal Amazon buyers since 2000 but three times is enough.The show still has all the charm, class, and tear jerking moments of the first, I heartily recommend everyone to watch the series.

Season 3 in my opinion is not as great as the previous two seasons, primarily because I felt a lot of the subplots got resolved in a pat manner and some characters, significant ones at that, are killed off. I won't mention which ones so as not to spoil the experience for those who are yet to watch the series but some of the actors playing these roles wished to move on to other projects and so there was no choice but to get rid of their characters.I thought Season 2 was a sad season because of the war and the losses resulting from it, including the death of a well-liked character and some dramatic turn of events. However, after watching Season 3, I have to say that the current season wins hands down in being a downer. Bates (Brendan Coyle), who is valet to the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) and is married to head housemaid, Anna Bates (Joanne Froggatt) gets sent to prison for the murder of his first wife though he claims he is innocent. For much of this season, Anna spends what little free time she has chasing leads to clear Bates' name and set him free.Downton is also in serious financial trouble thanks to the Earl making some questionable investment choices. All this and there's a wedding to prepare for, the much anticipated wedding between heir Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) and Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery). Will Downton survive? Lady Sybil is pregnant with her first child with husband, ex-chauffeur Branson (Allan Leech) and comes to stay at Downton for the wedding, though later events may cause the couple to remain indefinitely at Downton. Lady Edith who is always unfortunate in matters of love, thinks she may have finally found happiness, but as is often the case with Edith, things don't always go according to plan.I admit that this season does have a lot of depressing events in it but despite it all, it remains a riveting and engaging watch. I love how Julian Fellowes balances the drama of both upstairs in the Earl's family as well as the politics of downstairs. Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan)suffers a medical scare, Mrs. Patmore finds romance, and footman turned valet Thomas Barrow (Rob James-Collier) displays his sensitive side. There are some interesting developments among the staff but one can always rely on butler Mr. Carson (Jim Carter) to remain steadfast and stodgy!Dame Maggie Smith who plays the formidable Dowager Countess Grantham is amazing as usual and has some of the best lines in the show. She delivers them with such panache and is definitely one of the stars of the show. I think she is indispensable to the show's continued success and is certainly one of the main reasons why I adore the series so much.The sets, costumes, and cinematography remain as exquisite as ever, and though I could have done with a little less soap opera and bad news this season, I still would not trade Downton Abbey with anything else on TV at the moment.",5,The Dowager Countess alone makes it all worthwhile,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,2986,"['am', 'ardent', 'fan', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'have', 'watched', 'episodes', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'Season', '3', 'opinion', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'primarily', 'felt', 'lot', 'subplots', 'got', 'resolved', 'pat', 'manner', 'characters', 'significant', 'ones', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'ones', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'experience', 'who', 'are', 'yet', 'watch', 'series', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'wished', 'move', 'other', 'projects', 'so', 'was', 'choice', 'get', 'rid', 'characters.I', 'thought', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'sad', 'season', 'war', 'losses', 'resulting', 'including', 'death', 'well-liked', 'character', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'events', 'However', 'watching', 'Season', '3', 'have', 'say', 'current', 'season', 'hands', 'down', 'being', 'downer', 'Bates', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'who', 'valet', 'Earl', 'Grantham', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'married', 'head', 'housemaid', 'Anna', 'Bates', 'Joanne', 'Froggatt', 'sent', 'prison', 'murder', 'first', 'wife', 'innocent', 'much', 'season', 'Anna', 'what', 'little', 'free', 'time', 'chasing', 'leads', 'clear', 'Bates', 'name', 'set', 'free.Downton', 'also', 'serious', 'financial', 'trouble', 'thanks', 'Earl', 'making', 'questionable', 'investment', 'choices', 'wedding', 'prepare', 'much', 'anticipated', 'wedding', 'heir', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'Will', 'Downton', 'survive', 'Lady', 'Sybil', 'pregnant', 'first', 'child', 'husband', 'ex-chauffeur', 'Branson', 'Allan', 'Leech', 'stay', 'Downton', 'wedding', 'later', 'events', 'may', 'cause', 'couple', 'remain', 'indefinitely', 'Downton', 'Lady', 'Edith', 'who', 'always', 'unfortunate', 'matters', 'love', 'may', 'have', 'finally', 'found', 'happiness', 'often', 'case', 'Edith', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'go', 'according', 'plan.I', 'admit', 'season', 'have', 'lot', 'depressing', 'events', 'riveting', 'engaging', 'watch', 'love', 'how', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'drama', 'upstairs', 'Earl', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'politics', 'downstairs', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'Phyllis', 'Logan', 'medical', 'scare', 'Mrs.', 'Patmore', 'romance', 'footman', 'turned', 'valet', 'Thomas', 'Barrow', 'Rob', 'James-Collier', 'sensitive', 'side', 'are', 'interesting', 'developments', 'staff', 'one', 'can', 'always', 'rely', 'butler', 'Mr.', 'Carson', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'remain', 'steadfast', 'stodgy', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'who', 'formidable', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'Grantham', 'amazing', 'usual', 'best', 'lines', 'show', 'such', 'panache', 'definitely', 'one', 'stars', 'show', 'think', 'indispensable', 'show', 'continued', 'success', 'certainly', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'why', 'adore', 'series', 'much.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'remain', 'as', 'exquisite', 'ever', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'less', 'soap', 'opera', 'bad', 'news', 'season', 'still', 'would', 'not', 'trade', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'anything', 'else', 'TV', 'moment']",N/A
