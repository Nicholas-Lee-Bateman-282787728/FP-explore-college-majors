I must admit, it is worth much more and even though it is choppy and dissected from start to finish, it has its moments.

1067860,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B000P0IZVQ,The Jaundiced Eye,"[1, 3]","It took two tries for me to watch all of this bewildering mess. I gave up about half way through the first viewing, shaking my head in disbelief that such a confusing mess could actually be financed and released.The script and acting are frequently below the level of a mediocre high school play, and the truly amateurish direction and editing make the flimsy plot unintelligible. The atrocious editing requires special attention: it effectively destroyed any possibility of comprehension.  Scenes are terminated prematurely and the viewer then thrust into another, completely unrelated scene that was already underway.I watch a lot of independent films, because they generally lack the pretentious, glossy, profit-oriented phoniness of hollywood blockbusters...but this wretched mess makes me question the wisdom of this notion.As testimony to this movie's complete lack of positive attributes, the only flattering critical comment quoted on the DVD label was from a private review posted on the IMDB; no doubt written by someone associated with the movie itself. It is an industry joke that every movie, no matter how awful, seems to be able to locate or paraphrase some positive quotes from an established critic or publication....but not this one.I rest my case. This is an amateurish, confusing, poorly conceived and executed waste of time and (apparently very little) money. Please, for the sake of your wallet and faith in independent films, avoid it.",1,Atrocious....even for a low-budget independent movie !!!,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,1458,"['took', 'two', 'tries', 'watch', 'bewildering', 'mess', 'gave', 'up', 'way', 'first', 'viewing', 'shaking', 'head', 'disbelief', 'confusing', 'mess', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'financed', 'released.The', 'script', 'acting', 'are', 'frequently', 'level', 'mediocre', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'truly', 'amateurish', 'direction', 'editing', 'make', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'unintelligible', 'atrocious', 'editing', 'special', 'attention', 'effectively', 'destroyed', 'possibility', 'comprehension', 'Scenes', 'are', 'terminated', 'prematurely', 'viewer', 'then', 'thrust', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'scene', 'was', 'already', 'underway.I', 'watch', 'lot', 'independent', 'films', 'generally', 'lack', 'pretentious', 'glossy', 'profit-oriented', 'phoniness', 'hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'wretched', 'mess', 'question', 'wisdom', 'notion.As', 'testimony', 'movie', 'complete', 'lack', 'positive', 'attributes', 'only', 'flattering', 'critical', 'comment', 'quoted', 'DVD', 'label', 'was', 'private', 'review', 'posted', 'IMDB', 'doubt', 'written', 'someone', 'associated', 'movie', 'industry', 'joke', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'awful', 'be', 'able', 'locate', 'paraphrase', 'positive', 'quotes', 'established', 'critic', 'publication', 'not', 'one.I', 'rest', 'case', 'amateurish', 'confusing', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'executed', 'waste', 'time', 'apparently', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'Please', 'sake', 'wallet', 'faith', 'independent', 'films', 'avoid']",Sugar Creek
