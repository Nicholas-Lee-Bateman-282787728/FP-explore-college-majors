Gilda's is the best, as Cheri Oteri and Molly Shannon present the classic ""Nerds Make Out"" skit.Also, there are great montages each representing a five - year period in the show's hsitory, as well as a hysterical ""Weekend Update"" montage.The only thing not so good is the musical performances. I didn't like any of he oerformers. They could've had someone like Aerosmith or Billy Joel or Paul Simon perform or include the montage of msuical performances (there was one included when this was aired on television).Other than that note, this is a great look at ""Saturday Night Live's"" first five years.

512901,A1G1ZYRA96FCZH,B0000214GE,"Ian Stewart ""call me pookie""","[0, 0]","I only started watching SNL in early 2001 after moving to the US from Britain, and hadn't heard much of it before then apart from knowing that was where the Blues Brothers movie etc had originated. I soon became an avid watcher, partly because of a teeny weeny crush on Tina Fey but also because I loved Will Ferrell and Jimmy Fallon, amd later on, Rachel Dratch and Amy Poehler.I bought this DVD because I was keen to have a look for myself at some of the older stuff that other SNL fans were in raptures about. I have to say some of it was a bit dated, somewhat inevitably, but a lot of it was still very funny. I guess the people putting it together avoided topical political stuff, which quickly dates, although some of the stuff like impressions of various presidents holds up well.On a slightly macabre level, I loved the opportunity to watch people who have since died, particularly the outstandingly charismatic performers such as John Belushi and Chris Farley. In fact, the funniest thing on the whole show for me was Chris Farley interviewing Paul McCartney - funny and sweet all at the same time!The show is put together pretty smoothly, with current performers coming out and introducing each set of skits, which fits well with the DVD format since I can skip easily to the bits I regularly rewatch - I do think it could have been divided into shorter sections though. The introductions were quite variable in quality as other reviewers have pointed out, I was hoping for better things from Chris Rock and Adam Sandler for example. I was also a bit disappointed with the musical guests - it's a shame the Beastie Boys didn't get to play for real, and the Eurythimcs got too long, good though they were. I suppose the music had to a mix of up tempo and relaxing stuff to fit the mood of the show.I really enjoyed the special features like the interviews with former cast members and with Lorne Michaels, and I loved watching all the stars turn up in their tuxedos and dresses - there was such a sense of anticipation beforehand! The atmosphere was clearly very convivial among the audience, one could tell that former anxieties and tensions were put aside for the evening and former cast members and writers were all very much aware that the show was much bigger than they ever were.I really recommend this DVD for fans of SNL. Its the kind of show that you can dip into here and there according to your mood.

For example, in the 20th anniversary show, Dan Aykroyd & Jim Belushi spoke, and they showed clips of John's most famous and well-loved characters. This time around, it was Dan and Larraine Newman, who joked about selling Belushi stuff on eBay. The only clip was John's ""luck of the irish"" rant on Weekend Update. Granted, some of his other work was shown when they highlighted the cast from 1975-1980, but it still felt like a  hastily done memorial.Gilda's memorial was along the same lines, being introduced by Molly Shannon and Cheri Oteri, and consisting of a Nerds sketch. Both women said some nice things about Gilda being a groundbreaker for female comedians.The memorials for Phil and Chris were more heartfelt (Jon Lovitz for Phil and David Spade for Chris), almost to the point of being difficult to watch, because the intros were so emotional. The wounds from these two recent (at the time) and sudden deaths have obviously not healed, and it seemed a shame to make their friends and colleagues tearfully mourn their friends on live TV.Moving on to the musical guests...SNL has had many, many famous acts over the years, but instead of being shown clips from the best known and/or most notorious, there were instead performances by the Eurythmics, the Beastie Boys, and others who don't spring to mind, because they were kind of lost in the shuffle of clips. The performances were good, don't get me wrong, but I think the show could have done more to acknowledge and highlight some of the other performances over the years.The patter of the various hosts who introduced the series of clips was, for the most part, funny, with many nods to the famous people in the audience. Some people didn't get enough to say (Steve Martin) and some people got way too much (Adam Sandler). That contributed to the uneveness of the program. It's fun to watch if you've been a long time fan, but it doesn't give as complete a history of the show as it should, or even as previous anniversary shows have done.",3,I liked the 20th anniversary show better...,1051488000,"04 28, 2003",2003,2407,"['did', ""n't"", 'show', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'did', 'still', 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'appreciated', 'took', 'time', 'honor', 'lesser-known', 'SNL', 'players', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'Michael', ""O'Donoghue"", 'Danitra', 'Vance', 'as', 'well', 'famous', 'ones', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Gilda', 'Radner', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'Chris', 'Farley', '.However', 'thought', 'memorials', 'John', 'Gilda', 'Phil', 'Chris', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'done', 'example', '20th', 'anniversary', 'show', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'spoke', 'showed', 'clips', 'John', 'most', 'famous', 'well-loved', 'characters', 'time', 'around', 'was', 'Dan', 'Larraine', 'Newman', 'who', 'joked', 'selling', 'Belushi', 'stuff', 'eBay', 'only', 'clip', 'was', 'John', 'luck', 'irish', 'rant', 'Weekend', 'Update', 'Granted', 'other', 'work', 'was', 'shown', 'when', 'highlighted', 'cast', '1975-1980', 'still', 'felt', 'hastily', 'done', 'memorial.Gilda', 'memorial', 'was', 'same', 'lines', 'being', 'introduced', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Cheri', 'Oteri', 'consisting', 'Nerds', 'sketch', 'women', 'said', 'nice', 'things', 'Gilda', 'being', 'groundbreaker', 'female', 'comedians.The', 'memorials', 'Phil', 'Chris', 'were', 'more', 'heartfelt', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Phil', 'David', 'Spade', 'Chris', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'difficult', 'watch', 'intros', 'were', 'so', 'emotional', 'wounds', 'two', 'recent', 'time', 'sudden', 'deaths', 'have', 'obviously', 'not', 'healed', 'seemed', 'shame', 'make', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'tearfully', 'mourn', 'friends', 'live', 'TV.Moving', 'musical', 'guests', 'SNL', 'had', 'many', 'many', 'famous', 'acts', 'years', 'instead', 'being', 'shown', 'clips', 'best', 'known', 'and/or', 'most', 'notorious', 'were', 'instead', 'performances', 'Eurythmics', 'Beastie', 'Boys', 'others', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'spring', 'mind', 'were', 'kind', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'clips', 'performances', 'were', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'think', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'acknowledge', 'highlight', 'other', 'performances', 'years.The', 'patter', 'various', 'hosts', 'who', 'introduced', 'series', 'clips', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'funny', 'many', 'nods', 'famous', 'people', 'audience', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'say', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'people', 'got', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'contributed', 'uneveness', 'program', 'fun', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'been', 'long', 'time', 'fan', ""n't"", 'give', 'complete', 'history', 'show', 'should', 'even', 'previous', 'anniversary', 'shows', 'have', 'done']",Saturday Night Live: 25 Years Of Laughs VHS

Tom Hanks is the foil of a tried-and-true SNL convention--the host interrupted  by audience members--that brings out the comedic best in Jon Lovitz and  Christopher Walken. (By the way, if you missed this year's Walken-hosted  show, be sure to catch it in rerun. It was the best of the season so far.)  The show even contains some sentimental tributes to departed performers.  The beauty of these is that they are all done tastefully and they are, if  you are old enough to appreciate them, quite moving. The live musical  performances are quite good, particularly Elvis Costello backed by the  quite intent Beastie Boys. So good, in fact, that by the time this lengthy  (but never long) show ends, you might not even realize that the DVD does  not include the musical highlight segments that were part of the original  telecast. Too bad, otherwise this would be a five-star disc. There is one  segment included in the program that did not make it to air--an interesting  behind-the-scenes look at the creation of a show. This may not be a disc  you'll watch often, but it's an excellent sampling of what is now--gasp!--a  TV institution.

512906,A3CDR7VEX55JAD,B0000214GE,"Red Wood ""critic""","[8, 12]","This anniversary show was just okay the first time around-in 1989. That's right. If anyone taped that show(or owns it)there's a really good reason why THAT show, the 15th anniversary, isn't here-IT'S THE EXACT SAME SHOW!!! The 25th anniversary is not a taped rerun, mind you, but the EXACT same script(with minor changes in guests-which is understandable: some may not have been able to make this one). I thought that this was beyond surreal, when I first saw this one. I mean, it was down right just plain lazy on the writer's part. Am I the ONLY person to have caught this? Oh, brother!!! Anyway, since the 15th anniversary is no longer available here, no one else will ever know. Pathetic! As far as the show goes, itself, it's about as good-and bad-as the other criticism here explains. The only way to really view this is to check it out season by season, the way it was meant to be seen. I mean, they can stand on their own. Sadly, it'll only become more obvious that the writing became lazier-and less pointed-after the 70s. However, very little ever holds up to it's original incarnation-ie. original seasons(M*A*S*H, All in the Family, Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, Gunsmoke). There are fans for most of the seasons, though. Anyway, if there are completists for shows like ""X-Files"" and ""M*A*S*H"", there are surely those for this show.

Although short, the memorials for John Belushi and Chris Farley were great, however, they would've been better if they'd used more than just one skit (Belushi's &quot;Luck of the Irish&quot; banter and Farley's interview of Paul McCartney).

SNL legend Bill Murray's opening of the show is very inspired and warm as he is joined by Dan Aykroyd, Laraine Newman and Garrett Morris, evoking the great spirit the show once had. But this is where the fun stops.The rest of the show is just compilations cobbled together from most of the series. They're mostly punchlines without the set-up. So they're usually funny only if you've seen the actual sketches. And before each batch of clips you get a lot of 1 to 2 minute intros that aren't very funny.The tributes to the deceased castmates are just ordinary sketches where they were particulary amusing. But they could have found more somber, funny and appropriate tributes to the likes of John Belushi, Phil Hartman, Chris Farley and Gilda Ratner.Lorne Michaels made sure to showcase the revolutionary show's most popular sketches and alumni but deny us the groundbreaking or controversial moments. He also chose quantity over quality.

512909,A243HY69GIAHFI,B0000214GE,tropic_of_criticism,"[41, 43]","Amidst the perennial criticism of _Saturday Night Live_, it's easy to forget just how big an impact the show has had on our national artistic identity.  This retrospective is a great place to begin that (re)discovery.  Through its vast collection of clips from the show's 25-year run, one  gains a real appreciation of the hundreds of colloquialisms, impressions,  and comedic commentary this program has added to our national identity.What makes this show uniquely satisfying, however, is that it has  significant original programming, including remarkable new material from  Billy Crystal, Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Mike Meyers, Robert Smeigel, various  &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchors, and the Eurythmics.There's also a  fascinating montage on the production of a typical episode of SNL.  True,  this segment is in some ways cleverly-edited eye candy, but to my  knowledge, it's the only SNL-produced filmed exposition of the backstage  process at SNL. (There are three press bits on the DVD-version of the  product which greatly amplify one's appreciation of the show, but SNL  itself has still not produced a significant exploration of its own  machinations.)It is a difficult thing, I would imagine, to make an  anniversary show where so much material already exists.  The temptation for  Lorne Michaels was probably to air many more clips than his staff ended up  including.  For every bit that was included, there were at least five that  I personally might have included as well.  What Michaels and company were  going for, though, was not an anthology, but an anniversary party.  And  that's what they ended up with.  The show is in no way like the &quot;Best  of [insert performer's name here]&quot; series that SNL has recently been  releasing.  You won't find this to be a exhaustive  record of any aspect of  the SNL experience.  You won't even find that many complete sketches here.  And you certainly won't discover anything but oblique references to the  show's colorful off-screen history.  Rather, _SNL 25_ very much feels as  though they've gathered a few hundred of their closest friends (some of  whom pointedly refused to show up) and have said &quot;Hey, remember when  we did this?&quot;Happily, not only do we remember how good they were,  this anniversary special lets us see how good they still are.",5,Still crazy after all these years,953078400,"03 15, 2000",2000,2328,"['perennial', 'criticism', '_Saturday', 'Night', 'Live_', 'easy', 'forget', 'just', 'how', 'big', 'impact', 'show', 'had', 'national', 'artistic', 'identity', 'retrospective', 'great', 'place', 'begin', 're', 'discovery', 'vast', 'collection', 'clips', 'show', '25-year', 'run', 'one', 'gains', 'real', 'appreciation', 'hundreds', 'colloquialisms', 'impressions', 'comedic', 'commentary', 'program', 'added', 'national', 'identity.What', 'show', 'uniquely', 'satisfying', 'however', 'significant', 'original', 'programming', 'including', 'remarkable', 'new', 'material', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'Robert', 'Smeigel', 'various', 'quot', 'Weekend', 'Update', 'quot', 'anchors', 'Eurythmics.There', 'also', 'fascinating', 'montage', 'production', 'typical', 'episode', 'SNL', 'True', 'segment', 'ways', 'cleverly-edited', 'eye', 'candy', 'knowledge', 'only', 'SNL-produced', 'filmed', 'exposition', 'backstage', 'process', 'SNL', 'are', 'three', 'press', 'bits', 'DVD-version', 'product', 'greatly', 'amplify', 'one', 'appreciation', 'show', 'SNL', 'still', 'not', 'produced', 'significant', 'exploration', 'own', 'machinations', 'difficult', 'thing', 'would', 'imagine', 'make', 'anniversary', 'show', 'where', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'already', 'temptation', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'was', 'probably', 'air', 'many', 'more', 'clips', 'staff', 'ended', 'up', 'including', 'bit', 'was', 'included', 'were', 'least', 'five', 'personally', 'might', 'have', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'Michaels', 'company', 'were', 'going', 'though', 'was', 'not', 'anthology', 'anniversary', 'party', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'show', 'way', 'quot', 'Best', '[', 'insert', 'performer', 'name', 'here', ']', 'quot', 'series', 'SNL', 'recently', 'been', 'releasing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'exhaustive', 'record', 'aspect', 'SNL', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'many', 'complete', 'sketches', 'here', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discover', 'anything', 'oblique', 'references', 'show', 'colorful', 'off-screen', 'history', 'Rather', '_SNL', '25_', 'very', 'much', 'feels', ""'ve"", 'gathered', 'few', 'hundred', 'closest', 'friends', 'whom', 'pointedly', 'refused', 'show', 'up', 'have', 'said', 'quot', 'Hey', 'remember', 'when', 'did', 'quot', 'Happily', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'remember', 'how', 'good', 'were', 'anniversary', 'special', 'lets', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'still', 'are']",Saturday Night Live: 25 Years Of Laughs VHS
