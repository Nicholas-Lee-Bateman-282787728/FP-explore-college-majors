136495,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792835727,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Blown Away, 1994 filmThe story begins in a prison in Northern Ireland. One prisoner finds hidden supplies, he builds a bomb to escape from a hole in the wall! Next there is a hidden bomb at a university in Boston. A police bomb expert disables it just in time! He suffers from the strain. Elsewhere there is a tavern in Boston, we see the escaped prisoner (who watches the bomb expert on TV). This bomber calls to get information on the police bomb expert. We see a party for people. Later there is a bomb explosion! The police bomb expert teaches others his skills. That bomber gets a job as a janitor in police headquarters! [No security checks?] We now know who the bad guy is, and the good guy, so the drama comes from seeing when the police catch the bad guy.Will a bomb be placed in a police vehicle? Can they be warned in time? What was the purpose in this? That bomber calls the police bomb expert! [Believable? No Caller ID?] Will Leo&#8217;s wife and children be targeted? There is a personal motive for revenge here. The identification of the bomber will help in the search. Jimmy&#8217;s father makes contact with someone for information on Gaerity. But he is discovered and attacked! His son rushes to his rescue and finds him tied up and booby-trapped with a bomb! We see another dramatic event. Jimmy is upset. His wife tells him who was at the beach house. Gaerity cooks up some chemicals at home. Leo finds a clue, will this lead him to Gaerity? There is more conversation and drama. [Incredible?] There is fight with cartoon-ish action.Can Leo be rescued in time? Will there be explosions to wake up anyone who is dozing? We see the rockets red glare and other fireworks. Will Leo&#8217;s wife&#8217;s car have a bomb planted in it? Can Leo reach their car and dismantle the bomb? Can the crowd be dispersed? &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; And so the good guys win in the end.This is not a good story because of its somewhat unbelievable features (such as a too complex bomb fuze at the end). The more complex the mechanism, the more likely something can or will go wrong. But they thought it would improved the story, I guess. Given the recent bombing on Patriot&#8217;s Day (April 19) this may not be an amusing movie. You can decide otherwise. &#8220;Patriot&#8217;s Day&#8221; is a Massachusetts state holiday that commemorates the Battles of Lexington and Concord.",2,Terrorists Bomb Boston,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2383,"['Blown', 'Away', '1994', 'filmThe', 'story', 'prison', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'One', 'prisoner', 'hidden', 'supplies', 'bomb', 'escape', 'hole', 'wall', 'hidden', 'bomb', 'university', 'Boston', 'A', 'police', 'bomb', 'expert', 'just', 'time', 'strain', 'Elsewhere', 'tavern', 'Boston', 'see', 'escaped', 'prisoner', 'who', 'bomb', 'expert', 'TV', 'bomber', 'get', 'information', 'police', 'bomb', 'expert', 'see', 'party', 'people', 'Later', 'bomb', 'explosion', 'police', 'bomb', 'expert', 'others', 'skills', 'bomber', 'job', 'janitor', 'police', 'headquarters', '[', 'security', 'checks', 'now', 'know', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'drama', 'seeing', 'when', 'police', 'catch', 'bad', 'guy.Will', 'bomb', 'be', 'placed', 'police', 'vehicle', 'Can', 'be', 'warned', 'time', 'What', 'was', 'purpose', 'bomber', 'police', 'bomb', 'expert', '[', 'Believable', 'No', 'Caller', 'ID', ']', 'Will', 'Leo', '8217', 'wife', 'children', 'be', 'targeted', 'personal', 'motive', 'revenge', 'here', 'identification', 'bomber', 'will', 'help', 'search', 'Jimmy', '8217', 'father', 'contact', 'someone', 'information', 'Gaerity', 'discovered', 'attacked', 'son', 'rushes', 'rescue', 'tied', 'up', 'booby-trapped', 'bomb', 'see', 'dramatic', 'event', 'Jimmy', 'upset', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'beach', 'house', 'Gaerity', 'up', 'chemicals', 'home', 'Leo', 'clue', 'will', 'lead', 'Gaerity', 'more', 'conversation', 'drama', 'Incredible', ']', 'fight', 'cartoon-ish', 'action.Can', 'Leo', 'be', 'rescued', 'time', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'explosions', 'wake', 'up', 'anyone', 'who', 'dozing', 'see', 'rockets', 'red', 'glare', 'other', 'fireworks', 'Will', 'Leo', '8217', 'wife', '8217', 's', 'car', 'have', 'bomb', 'planted', 'Can', 'Leo', 'reach', 'car', 'dismantle', 'bomb', 'Can', 'crowd', 'be', 'dispersed', '8220', 'Who', 'are', '8221', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'end.This', 'not', 'good', 'story', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'features', 'such', 'too', 'complex', 'bomb', 'fuze', 'end', 'more', 'complex', 'mechanism', 'more', 'likely', 'something', 'can', 'will', 'go', 'wrong', 'thought', 'would', 'improved', 'story', 'guess', 'Given', 'recent', 'bombing', 'Patriot', '8217', 's', 'Day', 'April', '19', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'amusing', 'movie', 'can', 'decide', 'otherwise', '8220', 'Patriot', '8217', 's', 'Day', '8221', 'Massachusetts', 'state', 'holiday', 'Battles', 'Lexington', 'Concord']",N/A
136496,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,0792835727,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 4]","But ""Blown Away"" isn't a bad flick either. It has many of the right ingredients.  Look at the cast:  Jeff Bridges, Tommy Lee Jones, Forest Whitaker.  Jeff Bridges plays the freshly-retired bomb expert for the Boston Police Department.  When the mad bomber starts terrorizing Boston, Jeff jams his way back in and has to figure out whether to cut the red wire, or the green wire, or no wire . . . Whitaker plays the cool, by-the-numbers but somewhat cocky replacement to fill that job; naturally, the two form an odd-couple team.  Tommy Lee Jones is the mad bomber, and the movie gives us the vicarious thrill of seeing both sides of the game--what Tommy Lee's up to and exactly when he lets the fuzz onto his games.What didn't I like?  Through no fault of his own, the late Lloyd Bridges played such a hideous stereotype of an Irish-American, in white tam-o-shanter and spouting nonsensical maxims, that I'm considering giving up Lucky Charms.  The Jeff Bridges character is a nervous wreck.  Now:  would you rather have a bomb dismantled by someone who's competent and cool or by someone who's competent and a nervous wreck?  Me, too.  A somewhat labored backstory that I won't reveal gives us some insight into Jeff's irrationality, but at the expense of losing some of the film's credibility.Riffing off of this, I found the story trite and predictable.  Twenty minutes into the film you can make educated guesses about who is going to die, when children are going to be threatened, when Jeff is put on the spot, and whether there will be a happy ending.  I find it particularly telling that nobody at Jeff Bridges' retirement party asks him what his plans are for the future.  It seems that the moviemakers here so took the formula for granted that they forgot the mere pretense of having their just-fired lead character consider his future options!  Even the best actors could not redeem this routine material.So see this flick if you enjoy good acting, particularly of men under pressure.  Go if you like big explosions.  Don't go if you want a new and exciting story, because you won't find one.  That's why I can't give ""Blown Away"" any better than a middling rating.",3,"Chicka BOOM, Chicka BOOM!

A bit of stereotypes too make their presence in this movie, in terms of character and situation. For example, the character that Jeff Bridges plays is often a bit artificially constructed - its like building it in blocks. So what we have is a kind of jerky movement of character-creation, from loving-husband-to-be, to superhero ultracool fireman plagued with an inexplicable revulsion to his job, to son of an Irishman, to detective blessed with omniscience, to I-see-flashbacks-in-black-and-white; you get the drift! The plot is your typical ""I'm your friend, now back for revenge"" & how Jeff Bridges overcomes all the hurdles and faces his tormentor. Throw in some pretty interesting camera angles (outdoors especially) and some interesting fireworks, you've got the movie wrapped up.What makes this movie really nice and rescues it from a probable disaster is Tommy Lee Jones & U2. Jones' character is built right from the first scene where he escapes from prison till the very end. He also plays the role well, acting menacingly insane and dedicated to revenge. That he builds complex bombs with U2 in the background is a real interesting treatment & this movie is worth watching for just those sequences, if not anything else - especially if you're a U2 fan!Blown Away - definitely watchable once, dont expect much and just sit back and relax and enjoy this movie.",3,Sort of ok - watchable definitely,1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,1535,"['Ok', 'would', 'come', 'typical', 'action', 'movie', 'where', 'effects', 'stunts', 'are', 'perfect', 'excuses', 'seemingly', 'glaring', 'loopholes', 'characterization', 'plot', 'bit', 'stereotypes', 'too', 'make', 'presence', 'movie', 'terms', 'character', 'situation', 'example', 'character', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'often', 'bit', 'artificially', 'constructed', 'building', 'blocks', 'So', 'what', 'have', 'kind', 'jerky', 'movement', 'character-creation', 'loving-husband-to-be', 'superhero', 'ultracool', 'fireman', 'plagued', 'inexplicable', 'revulsion', 'job', 'son', 'Irishman', 'detective', 'blessed', 'omniscience', 'I-see-flashbacks-in-black-and-white', 'get', 'drift', 'plot', 'typical', ""'m"", 'friend', 'now', 'back', 'revenge', 'how', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'hurdles', 'tormentor', 'Throw', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'camera', 'angles', 'outdoors', 'especially', 'interesting', 'fireworks', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'wrapped', 'up.What', 'movie', 'really', 'nice', 'probable', 'disaster', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'U2', 'Jones', 'character', 'built', 'right', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'prison', 'very', 'end', 'also', 'role', 'well', 'acting', 'menacingly', 'insane', 'dedicated', 'revenge', 'complex', 'bombs', 'U2', 'background', 'real', 'interesting', 'treatment', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'sequences', 'not', 'anything', 'else', 'especially', ""'re"", 'U2', 'fan', 'Blown', 'Away', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'once', 'dont', 'expect', 'much', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A
136499,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792835727,Austin Somlo,"[1, 2]","Viewed: 9/10Rate: 49/10: The best part of Blown Away is every time there is an explosion, we are shown the facial reaction of Jeff Bridges. How he does it is awesome and sublime. However, the rest of the film is pure rubbish and silly. Since when the conflict escalates to mano a mano whenever there is a terroristic attack on a major city, especially with the usage of bombs? It never happens that it is handled by the local bomb squad alone. That's why the film fell apart quite quickly for me. The story behind the relationship between Ryan Gaerity and Liam McGivney (cute Irish names) is unclear to me as always. The scenes with the explosions are cool, but they look boring at same time. There was one particular scene, or maybe two of them, where Tommy Lee Jones was praying to himself while being so near to the scene of bomb. Don't you think that's rather too close to be near it? Why did the bomber wait until the last second to blow the woman and the daughter up? Just get it over with already. The Irish filled dialogues were getting ridiculous and far too much; it allowed the movie to be more of a ""Irish Impromptu Skit Show.""

136500,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0792835727,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","While this movie is intense, it suffers from the serious flaw that a known mad bomber is able to move easily throughout Boston. Tommy Lee Jones plays an IRA (Irish Republican Army) bomber that has just managed to break out of prison. Jeff Bridges plays a former fellow IRA bomber who broke with the IRA and is now part of the bomb disposal squad in the Boston police department. He has taken the new name of Jimmy Dove and has not informed his wife or employer that he is a former member of the IRA. Lloyd Bridges as a relative of Jimmy's and Forest Whitaker as a fellow member of the Boston bomb squad fill supporting roles.The action is intense at times as the Jones character is truly a mad bomber and he can build a bomb out of almost anything. A tension meter is clicking louder as Jimmy's wife moves through their house after Jones has been in it, opening things, firing up the gas stove, turning on lights, doing all of the things that one does. Since each could be the trigger for the bomb, you edge closer to the edge of your seat as she completes one action after another.All of this goes over the top at the end when the Jones character uses an elaborate Rube Goldberg device to execute a self-destruct mechanism in his place of residence. It seems to serve no useful purpose other than to provide enough time for the struggle between Jimmy and the Jones character to run its' lengthy course.If you like things exploding all the time and are willing to suspend a bit of disbelief over the ease with which the Jones character manages to put bombs in any place he chooses, then you will enjoy this movie. Absent that, you will probably engage in too much disbelief to take it completely seriously.",4,"If you like explosions and don't think too hard about the ease of the bombings, then you will enjoy it",1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,1706,"['movie', 'intense', 'serious', 'flaw', 'known', 'mad', 'bomber', 'able', 'move', 'easily', 'Boston', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'IRA', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army', 'bomber', 'just', 'managed', 'break', 'prison', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'former', 'fellow', 'IRA', 'bomber', 'who', 'broke', 'IRA', 'now', 'part', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'squad', 'Boston', 'police', 'department', 'taken', 'new', 'name', 'Jimmy', 'Dove', 'not', 'informed', 'wife', 'employer', 'former', 'member', 'IRA', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'relative', 'Jimmy', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'fellow', 'member', 'Boston', 'bomb', 'squad', 'fill', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'action', 'intense', 'times', 'Jones', 'character', 'truly', 'mad', 'bomber', 'can', 'build', 'bomb', 'almost', 'anything', 'tension', 'meter', 'clicking', 'louder', 'Jimmy', 'wife', 'moves', 'house', 'Jones', 'been', 'opening', 'things', 'firing', 'up', 'gas', 'stove', 'turning', 'lights', 'doing', 'things', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'trigger', 'bomb', 'edge', 'closer', 'edge', 'seat', 'one', 'action', 'another.All', 'top', 'end', 'when', 'Jones', 'character', 'elaborate', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'device', 'execute', 'self-destruct', 'mechanism', 'place', 'residence', 'serve', 'useful', 'purpose', 'other', 'provide', 'enough', 'time', 'struggle', 'Jimmy', 'Jones', 'character', 'run', 'lengthy', 'course.If', 'things', 'exploding', 'time', 'are', 'willing', 'suspend', 'bit', 'disbelief', 'ease', 'Jones', 'character', 'put', 'bombs', 'place', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Absent', 'will', 'probably', 'engage', 'too', 'much', 'disbelief', 'take', 'completely', 'seriously']",N/A

While I couldn't care less if Keanu got blown away or not.Most IRA movies made in Hollywood are always critisized for weak plots and the actors not sounding like real Irishmen. While this is generally true (Brad Pitt in the Devil's Own) it certainly isn't for Blown Away. Tommy Lee Jones is quite convincing as a deranged IRA bomber who goes after Jeff Bridges in revenge for betraying him 25 years earlier.Stephen Hopkins uses his fave cinematographer and composer Peter Levy and Alan Silvestri to bring some visual style and a powerful musical score to accompany the action and explosion scenes. The final encounter between Jones and Bridges is WAY cool. Trust me. It's one of the best showdowns in history.A cool use of widescreen photography captures a pleasant and eye-pleasing view of Boston. I only ever saw this city in Cheers previously and now it makes wanna visit. This film was overlooked in the summer of 1994 because the audience was too busy with Keanu foiling Dennis Hopper. But Speed was just about a bomber wanting money.

It's about the worst it could be for a person trying to imitate half-Irish half-Boston.

Those reviews couldn't be farther from the truth.Blown Away teaches a valuable lesson: its ok to put a friendship at stake if its for a good cause. When Jeff Bridges left Belfast, Northern Ireland and changed his name, it was after his former friend, played by Tommy Lee Jones, was put away in Castle Gleigh prison in Northern Ireland. It seems unrealistic to see Jones' character ever breaking out AND finding Bridges, but he uses his own talent with building explosive devices to escape prison and he spots Bridges, whose name changes from Liam McGivney to Jimmy Dove on the screen.Without spoiling anything, Tommy Lee Jones' character, Ryan Gaerity, does kill friends of Jimmy Dove, and the deaths are followed by very well-crafted scenes that seem to convey the emotion, pain and suffering of Bridges very effectively.Both Jones and Bridges are well-cast and suitable for their roles. They both portray the Irish descent very believably, especially Jones (who, in the same year, 1994, did a pretty bad job of trying to sound southern in the movie ""The Client"").I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13, and at that time i wasn't supposed to be watching it because it was rated R, and now, at 20, I still watch it and consider it one of the most underrated movies ever just because critics think that the high presence of explosions takes away from the plot. Its a shame that it didn't get better reviews, but, Tommy Lee Jones went to Harvard to learn how to act, and he sure did a good job in this movie. He won a few awards as best villain, deservedly. Today, movies like ""The Matrix,"" are bringing in millions for not having a plot. Go for ""Blown Away.""

136525,A3QZRCZWDN5ZFV,0792835727,wulfgar,"[0, 0]","This is one of Tommy Lee Jones's best performances.Never expected to see him play a mad, genius bomber that was even too crazy for the Irish Republican Army to want to recruit.I like it when an actor stretches themselves from roles they normally don't play, and that's what Lee does here.He speaks in an Irish Dialect used by the prisoners so the British Guards can't understand them, then switches back to English with an Irish accent, then to English without his real life Texas accent.The movies premise was pretty ridiculous but I loved it anyway.I don't give spoilers away but after 20 years in an Irish prison Lee makes his way to Boston, finds former comrade in arms Bridges living their by accident, wants revenge for the 20 years he spent in prison and other things, and all hell breaks loose.The action starts from the beginning of the film until the very end and I liked the music chosen during certain parts of the movie, also this was obviously filmed in Boston and at that time Boston looked beautiful to me, though I've heard many parts are poor and full of crime, but this movie did not show any of that.The only bad part of the movie I could find was the bad acting of Forest Whitaker, who I think is a good actor but in this film he was hard to watch, and his character was unlikable, arrogant and annoying to me.Other than that this movie was great and action packed.Hail Odin!!!!!!!!!!",5,I saw this in the late 90's.,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,1405,"['one', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'best', 'performances.Never', 'expected', 'see', 'play', 'mad', 'genius', 'bomber', 'was', 'even', 'too', 'crazy', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army', 'want', 'recruit.I', 'when', 'actor', 'roles', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'what', 'Lee', 'here.He', 'speaks', 'Irish', 'Dialect', 'used', 'prisoners', 'British', 'Guards', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'then', 'back', 'English', 'Irish', 'accent', 'then', 'English', 'real', 'life', 'Texas', 'accent.The', 'movies', 'premise', 'was', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'loved', 'anyway.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'spoilers', 'away', '20', 'years', 'Irish', 'prison', 'Lee', 'way', 'Boston', 'former', 'comrade', 'arms', 'Bridges', 'living', 'accident', 'revenge', '20', 'years', 'spent', 'prison', 'other', 'things', 'hell', 'loose.The', 'action', 'beginning', 'film', 'very', 'end', 'liked', 'music', 'chosen', 'certain', 'parts', 'movie', 'also', 'was', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'Boston', 'time', 'Boston', 'looked', 'beautiful', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'parts', 'are', 'poor', 'full', 'crime', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'that.The', 'only', 'bad', 'part', 'movie', 'could', 'find', 'was', 'bad', 'acting', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'who', 'think', 'good', 'actor', 'film', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'character', 'was', 'unlikable', 'arrogant', 'annoying', 'me.Other', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'action', 'packed.Hail', 'Odin']",N/A
