Gehlke ""Cat Mom""","[0, 2]","Although the reviews here and the online rental place mostly bad reviews, I put the movie in my queue because I like all the actors.  I don't mind at all that a movie slowly builds on it's characters but for me, I felt that George (Paul Rudd) really wasn't all that interesting or endearing enough to draw me in or to get the girl.  The end is pretty obvious but still I was hoping for more to like about George.",2,"Some characters great, some not so much",1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,412,"['reviews', 'here', 'online', 'rental', 'place', 'mostly', 'bad', 'reviews', 'put', 'movie', 'queue', 'like', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movie', 'slowly', 'characters', 'felt', 'George', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'endearing', 'enough', 'draw', 'get', 'girl', 'end', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'still', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'like', 'George']",N/A

In my opinion, How Do You Know? was much btter than the Tourist in terms of the message it sent across and the after-feel I had when the movie was over.

1342286,A14N5L5T089VX3,B003EYVXXC,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[67, 81]","My wife and I really enjoyed ""How Do You Know.""  The script itself was slightly on the bland side, as others have noted, but the film itself is redeemed by some great performances and excellent direction and editing.  For us, it generated consistent laughs and smiles throughout the film, as well as lots of undercurrents and multileveled themes to ponder after we left the theatre.What really made the film work for me were the performances of the Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson and Paul Rudd.  The Director / Writer (James L. Brooks) spends lots of screen time doing closeups on the faces of these three performers, allowing us to see the interplay of complex emotions on their faces as they wrestle with the dilemmas they are confronting.  This would not have worked unless Mr. Brooks was able to coax finely tuned and believable emotions out of these excellent actors; and he is superb at doing so.The flip side of this is that it takes time to allow these emotions to play out, so the film seems slower paced than films that are more concerned with situational comedy (and perhaps then less concerned with exploring the emotional depths of relationships).Combined with this are some really hysterical scenes.  Owen Wilson has long been known as a great comedic sidekick, and that well-honed character he always seems to play - bumbling, shallow, narcissistic and clueless - plays well in this film.  Yet, even his character plumbs emotional depths I've never seen from him in other films.  Paul Rudd, who I am not as familiar with, also did a great job.  Yet, what makes the film shine is Reese Witherspoon's performance.  You really connect-with her character.  The film ends predictably, and was foreshadowed from the very start.  I would have preferred another few minutes to give us insight into the outcomes of Reese's choice at the end of the film.I saw some interesting themes and visual statements popping up again and again throughout the film, such as the way in which the characters would engage in extended dialog with one of them offscreen, before they'd walk into the shot at the end of the conversation.  There is also a great scene where Rudd's and Reese's characters play-out their own feelings for each other by helping an acquaintance with her own marriage proposal.  Another interesting contrast, which intentionally sums up the relationships each had with her - was the gifts the two male leads both offer to Reese's character just before her ""Birthday party"" - how they were presented, what they meant to the givers, and Reese's reactions to them and their presentation.Ultimately, the film explores the difference and relationship between external and internal love, between self love and love for other, between sacrificial love and self preservation. It does it well, and it does it in unexpected ways.  This is definitely a film I will purchase when it comes out on Blu-Ray and watch several times to really ""get"" all of the more subtle messages and themes being presented.  I think the pacing could have been a bit better, and I was a bit let down by the ending as I said, so will rate it four stars - really good, but some room for improvement.",4,A Romantic Comedy with complex underpinnings,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,3177,"['wife', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'How', 'Do', 'Know', 'script', 'was', 'slightly', 'bland', 'side', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'redeemed', 'great', 'performances', 'excellent', 'direction', 'editing', 'generated', 'consistent', 'laughs', 'smiles', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'lots', 'undercurrents', 'multileveled', 'themes', 'ponder', 'left', 'theatre.What', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'work', 'were', 'performances', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Director', '/', 'Writer', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'lots', 'screen', 'time', 'doing', 'closeups', 'three', 'performers', 'allowing', 'see', 'interplay', 'complex', 'emotions', 'wrestle', 'dilemmas', 'are', 'confronting', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'was', 'able', 'coax', 'finely', 'tuned', 'believable', 'emotions', 'excellent', 'actors', 'superb', 'doing', 'so.The', 'flip', 'side', 'time', 'allow', 'emotions', 'play', 'out', 'film', 'slower', 'paced', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'situational', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'then', 'less', 'concerned', 'exploring', 'emotional', 'depths', 'relationships', '.Combined', 'are', 'really', 'hysterical', 'scenes', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'long', 'been', 'known', 'great', 'comedic', 'sidekick', 'well-honed', 'character', 'always', 'play', 'bumbling', 'shallow', 'narcissistic', 'clueless', 'plays', 'well', 'film', 'even', 'character', 'plumbs', 'emotional', 'depths', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'who', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'what', 'film', 'shine', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'performance', 'really', 'connect-with', 'character', 'film', 'predictably', 'was', 'foreshadowed', 'very', 'start', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'few', 'minutes', 'give', 'insight', 'outcomes', 'Reese', 'choice', 'end', 'film.I', 'saw', 'interesting', 'themes', 'visual', 'statements', 'popping', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'film', 'such', 'way', 'characters', 'would', 'engage', 'extended', 'dialog', 'one', 'offscreen', ""'d"", 'walk', 'shot', 'end', 'conversation', 'also', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'Rudd', 'Reese', 'characters', 'play-out', 'own', 'feelings', 'other', 'helping', 'acquaintance', 'own', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'intentionally', 'up', 'relationships', 'had', 'was', 'gifts', 'two', 'male', 'offer', 'Reese', 'character', 'just', 'Birthday', 'party', 'how', 'were', 'presented', 'what', 'meant', 'givers', 'Reese', 'reactions', 'presentation.Ultimately', 'film', 'difference', 'relationship', 'external', 'internal', 'love', 'self', 'love', 'love', 'other', 'sacrificial', 'love', 'self', 'preservation', 'well', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'definitely', 'film', 'will', 'purchase', 'when', 'out', 'Blu-Ray', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'get', 'more', 'subtle', 'messages', 'themes', 'being', 'presented', 'think', 'pacing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'ending', 'said', 'so', 'will', 'rate', 'four', 'really', 'good', 'room', 'improvement']",N/A

1342288,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003EYVXXC,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","It's surprising to me to think that a name as big and as well-known as James L. Brooks can only be associated with (as far as directorial works are concerned) to six films.  Of those six, I've seen five.  Of those five, this is the worst (I'm in that rare group that considers `Spanglish' to be better than the Oscar winning `As Good As It Gets').  I won't say that I'm a real fan of his work.  In fact, of the five that I've seen, the only one I really adore is `Broadcast News'.  I find `As Good As It Gets' to be highly overrated and a tad too one-dimensional (despite firmly standing behind Hunt's Oscar win, which was glorious).  I find `Terms of Endearment' to be wonderfully nostalgic and beautifully composed, if a tad pretentious and manipulative.  `Spanglish' is overreaching, sure, but I applaud its ambitious nature despite being sloppy in parts and unashamed in its own unevenness.  One thing that all of the aforementioned films contain that `How Do You Know' does not is heart.  Even a film as sharply conflicting in tone as `Spanglish' was bursting with real heart.`How Do You Know' just feels awkward; and not in a `haha funny' way.The film centers around a young woman who is reaching an age that forces her, as a woman, out of her `life'.  She is a female baseball player who winds up being thrown out because she's thirty-one.  She is in a relationship with a dim-witted male baseball player who is a serious womanizer and a tad too self-absorbed.  She meets a businessman in serious legal trouble thanks to his careless father and the two start to bond while he plays `shoulder to cry on' while she dukes things out with her boyfriend.The problem with `How Do You Know' is that I just didn't care about anyone.  I mean, even in Brooks less successful offerings (anything not made in the 80's) he brought a good deal of heart to his characters.  You couldn't help but sincerely love Hunt's character in `As Good As It Gets', and even when Tea Leoni was confessing her adulterous behavior your heart was breaking for her because she was so `real'.  Nothing about `How Do You Know' can begin to feel `real' and so it just doesn't work.  I can understand the approach to certain conversations and sequences having that `awkward/real' feel to them, but they don't always work in films, especially of this nature.  This is a comedy that isn't all that funny (accept Owen Wilson's character who is the only real standout here and made me laugh out loud a lot) and so the awkward moments don't work because they don't feel anything but awkward.  They don't even get a smile.  They just feel ill conceived.Reese Witherspoon used to be so awesome (the late 90's, early aughts were her stomping ground) but ever since her Oscar win she has plummeted and she feels limited in range and her past onscreen charisma feels nonexistent.  Paul Rudd is still adorable and manages to make the most of his character, but he isn't memorable here (or at least his character isn't).  Jack Nicholson yells a lot and chokes and is kind of gross and boring (I still love you Jack, but seriously...try a little!) and Kathryn Hahn is just obnoxious.UGH, and don't get me started on that proposal scene that just felt so...wrong.The film is a mess, which is a shame because I really expected more out of Brooks and his cast; especially Rudd.  I mean, I've never considered Brooks the greatest director or anything (even though the rest of the world seems to, and I acknowledge and semi-understand that) but I did expect him to try a little here.",2,How do you know when you need to sit back and reassess your career?,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,3536,"['surprising', 'think', 'name', 'big', 'as', 'well-known', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'associated', 'as', 'far', 'directorial', 'works', 'are', 'concerned', 'six', 'films', 'six', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'five', 'five', 'worst', ""'m"", 'rare', 'group', 'Spanglish', 'be', 'better', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'real', 'fan', 'work', 'fact', 'five', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'adore', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'find', 'As', 'Good', 'be', 'highly', 'overrated', 'tad', 'too', 'one-dimensional', 'firmly', 'standing', 'Hunt', 'Oscar', 'win', 'was', 'glorious', 'find', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'be', 'wonderfully', 'nostalgic', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'tad', 'pretentious', 'manipulative', 'Spanglish', 'overreaching', 'sure', 'applaud', 'ambitious', 'nature', 'being', 'sloppy', 'parts', 'unashamed', 'own', 'unevenness', 'One', 'thing', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'contain', 'How', 'Do', 'Know', 'not', 'heart', 'Even', 'film', 'sharply', 'conflicting', 'tone', 'Spanglish', 'was', 'bursting', 'real', 'heart.', 'How', 'Do', 'Know', 'just', 'feels', 'awkward', 'not', 'haha', 'funny', 'way.The', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'reaching', 'age', 'woman', 'life', 'female', 'baseball', 'player', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'thrown', 'out', 'thirty-one', 'relationship', 'dim-witted', 'male', 'baseball', 'player', 'who', 'serious', 'womanizer', 'tad', 'too', 'self-absorbed', 'businessman', 'serious', 'legal', 'trouble', 'thanks', 'careless', 'father', 'two', 'start', 'bond', 'shoulder', 'cry', 'things', 'out', 'boyfriend.The', 'problem', 'How', 'Do', 'Know', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'anyone', 'mean', 'even', 'Brooks', 'successful', 'offerings', 'anything', 'not', 'made', '80', 'brought', 'good', 'deal', 'heart', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'sincerely', 'love', 'Hunt', 'character', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'even', 'when', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'was', 'confessing', 'adulterous', 'behavior', 'heart', 'was', 'breaking', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'Nothing', 'How', 'Do', 'Know', 'can', 'begin', 'feel', 'real', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'can', 'understand', 'approach', 'certain', 'conversations', 'sequences', 'having', 'awkward/real', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'films', 'especially', 'nature', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'funny', 'accept', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'character', 'who', 'only', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'lot', 'so', 'awkward', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'awkward', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'smile', 'just', 'feel', 'ill', 'conceived.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'used', 'be', 'so', 'awesome', 'late', '90', 'early', 'aughts', 'were', 'stomping', 'ground', 'ever', 'Oscar', 'win', 'plummeted', 'feels', 'limited', 'range', 'past', 'onscreen', 'charisma', 'feels', 'nonexistent', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'still', 'adorable', 'make', 'most', 'character', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'here', 'least', 'character', ""n't"", 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'lot', 'chokes', 'kind', 'gross', 'boring', 'still', 'love', 'Jack', 'seriously', 'try', 'little', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'just', 'obnoxious.UGH', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'proposal', 'just', 'felt', 'so', 'wrong.The', 'film', 'mess', 'shame', 'really', 'expected', 'more', 'Brooks', 'cast', 'especially', 'Rudd', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'never', 'considered', 'Brooks', 'greatest', 'director', 'anything', 'even', 'rest', 'world', 'acknowledge', 'semi-understand', 'did', 'expect', 'try', 'little', 'here']",N/A

Witherspoon's character is a great gal, but has been so dedicated to her career in women's baseball, she lives by all the sports slogans taped to her mirror and must now find out how she really feels about her life when she is cut from the team. Rudd is bright, amiable and truly a good person but also a bit of a patsy about standing up for himself, especially when his financial wizard father, Jack Nicholson, needs to pin a fraud rap on him and his career-driven fiance dumps him in the scandalous aftermath.  Before he can implode and drown in self-pity, he encounters Witherspoon and is completely taken with her honesty and positive outlook....and also her quirks. Wilson is a sweet, successful and self-centered baseball pro but in a good way.  He has had little inclination or motivation to commit to or understand his many romantic partners until Witherspoon's strikes an honest chord in him. This is basically about Witherspoon finding herself through her encounters with these two very different men, and Rudd's surviving a personal sinking ship when he sees the possibilities for love and true happiness with this girl. Wilson his terrific as a likeable cad, and Kathryn Hahn is a delight as Rudd's pregnant and protective secretary.  Nicholson is just okay using too many of the tics we have seen too often. Rudd and Witherspoon are both outstanding. ( I have liked every moment Rudd has ever put on film.)  These characters need time to evolve and we get to be in on that, so this is not a crude gag film.

Brooks is so very good at what he does.Like Broadcast News, As Good As it Gets, and even Spanglish (not to mention the lesser known I'll Do Anything),  I had mixed feelings about the complex characters at first (I was very upset with the windup of Broadcast News, for instance, and it later became one of my favorite films). I think one of the first impressions is: am I supposed to like these people or not? And what exactly, am I rooting for?Brooks creates real, dimensional characters, with unpredictable futures. However, he works inside a romantic comedy genre that can seem familiar. So when the characters don't behave as they do in traditional romantic comedies, it's actually a bit jarring at first. That's not a knock at Brooks, but a big knock at the hundreds of predictable romantic comedies that are churned out; movies where you can literally predict the endings by watching the coming attractions.In real life, people are in sort of a gray area most of the time. Brooks allows people their gray areas. How Do You Know doesn't provide neat happy endings for its characters. Brooks establishes a bit of hope and a sense of forward motion - no more, and no less. It may seem a subtle difference, but it makes a world of difference compared to most ""romantic comedies."" You may or may not root for his characters to succeed in their relationships with others, but you root big time for them to succeed in their individual journeys.

1342305,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B003EYVXXC,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","Somewhere hidden in this overlong, often exasperating 2010 comedy is a small-scale independent film about flawed characters trying to take charge of their lives when they really never had the control to begin with. That more intimate movie is the one I wanted to see, but veteran director/screenwriter James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment) appears focused on showing the messiness of their lives by adding incidental characters and overinvolved subplots that do little to enrich the romantic triangle at the story's heart. This approach could have worked better as a TV series where you would have a reason to come back every episode, but I think Brooks makes a fundamental mistake in thinking that such an approach works over a two-hour running time because the emotional payoff feels marginal. That's not to say the movie isn't smart, insightful, and funny in its scattershot way, but it's just too unwieldy to love.Similar to the structure of Brooks'Broadcast News, the meandering plot focuses on 31-year-old Lisa Jorgenson, a popular career softball player who suddenly gets cut from the Team USA roster. Cast adrift from her one passion in life, she starts dating Matty Reynolds, a self-indulgent A-Rod-type pro baseball player with a classic case of Peter Pan Syndrome. In this tenuous situation comes George Madison, a financial executive who first alienates Lisa by giving her a courtesy call just to tell her he is seeing someone else. However, his world comes crashing down when he becomes the target of a criminal investigation for corporate malfeasance at a company run by his conniving tycoon father Charles Madison. George's shallow girlfriend dumps him, so he calls Lisa for what turns out to be a disastrous blind date. At the same time, they haphazardly bond over their respective misfortunes just as Matty tries to acquit himself of his selfish, womanizing ways. The romantic triangle is set up for further complications until the eventual resolution.The stars perform admirably under the circumstances. In Lisa, Reese Witherspoon finds a role that accommodates her likeable steeliness with a gently probing vulnerability. Playing Matty, Owen Wilson comes across more predictably amusing as the supreme man-boy so proud of his glimmers of maturity that he has to announce them out loud to Lisa. Paul Rudd probably fares the best of the trio as George simply because he has that schlubby everyman demeanor down to an art, and there is a flattering hint of Jack Lemmon circa 1960 in his performance. Jack Nicholson returns in his fourth role in a Brooks film, this time playing the subsidiary role of Charles with his mastery of sleaze intact. Kathryn Hahn portrays George's loyal and very pregnant assistant Annie in a little too broad a manner for the company she keeps here, but my guess is that Brooks encouraged her to play it that way in order to provide a striking contrast with the introspective workings of the principal characters.Considering the film's disappointing box office returns, the 2011 DVD offers a surprisingly abundant set of extras - a decent audio commentary by Brooks and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski plus a select scenes commentary with Brooks and Wilson obviously focusing on the actor's scenes as Matty; four deleted scenes; a quick blooper reel; and a fifteen-minute making-of featurette. The Blu-Ray adds an interactive script gallery; a conversation with Brooks and composer Hans Zimmer; more deleted scenes with more Brooks commentary, and another featurette focused on Rudd's character.",3,"Despite a Stellar Trio of Stars, Brooks Sags This Time Around with a Meandering Triangle Yarn",1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,3539,"['Somewhere', 'hidden', 'overlong', 'often', 'exasperating', '2010', 'comedy', 'small-scale', 'independent', 'film', 'flawed', 'characters', 'trying', 'take', 'charge', 'lives', 'when', 'really', 'never', 'had', 'control', 'begin', 'more', 'intimate', 'movie', 'one', 'wanted', 'see', 'veteran', 'director/screenwriter', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'focused', 'showing', 'messiness', 'lives', 'adding', 'incidental', 'characters', 'overinvolved', 'subplots', 'do', 'little', 'enrich', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'story', 'heart', 'approach', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'TV', 'series', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'reason', 'come', 'back', 'episode', 'think', 'Brooks', 'fundamental', 'mistake', 'thinking', 'approach', 'over', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'feels', 'marginal', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'smart', 'insightful', 'funny', 'scattershot', 'way', 'just', 'too', 'unwieldy', 'love.Similar', 'structure', ""Brooks'Broadcast"", 'News', 'meandering', 'plot', '31-year-old', 'Lisa', 'Jorgenson', 'popular', 'career', 'softball', 'player', 'who', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'Team', 'USA', 'roster', 'Cast', 'adrift', 'one', 'passion', 'life', 'dating', 'Matty', 'Reynolds', 'self-indulgent', 'A-Rod-type', 'pro', 'baseball', 'player', 'classic', 'case', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Syndrome', 'tenuous', 'situation', 'George', 'Madison', 'financial', 'executive', 'who', 'first', 'Lisa', 'giving', 'courtesy', 'call', 'just', 'tell', 'seeing', 'someone', 'else', 'However', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'target', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'corporate', 'malfeasance', 'company', 'run', 'conniving', 'tycoon', 'father', 'Charles', 'Madison', 'George', 'shallow', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'Lisa', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'disastrous', 'blind', 'date', 'same', 'time', 'haphazardly', 'bond', 'respective', 'misfortunes', 'just', 'Matty', 'acquit', 'selfish', 'womanizing', 'ways', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'set', 'up', 'further', 'complications', 'eventual', 'resolution.The', 'stars', 'perform', 'admirably', 'circumstances', 'Lisa', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'role', 'likeable', 'steeliness', 'gently', 'probing', 'vulnerability', 'Playing', 'Matty', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'more', 'predictably', 'amusing', 'supreme', 'man-boy', 'proud', 'glimmers', 'maturity', 'announce', 'out', 'loud', 'Lisa', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'probably', 'best', 'trio', 'George', 'simply', 'schlubby', 'everyman', 'down', 'art', 'flattering', 'hint', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'circa', '1960', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'returns', 'fourth', 'role', 'Brooks', 'film', 'time', 'playing', 'subsidiary', 'role', 'Charles', 'mastery', 'sleaze', 'intact', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'George', 'loyal', 'very', 'pregnant', 'assistant', 'Annie', 'little', 'too', 'broad', 'manner', 'company', 'here', 'guess', 'Brooks', 'encouraged', 'play', 'way', 'order', 'provide', 'striking', 'contrast', 'introspective', 'workings', 'principal', 'characters.Considering', 'film', 'disappointing', 'box', 'office', 'returns', '2011', 'DVD', 'surprisingly', 'abundant', 'set', 'extras', 'decent', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Brooks', 'cinematographer', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'select', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Brooks', 'Wilson', 'obviously', 'focusing', 'actor', 'scenes', 'Matty', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'quick', 'blooper', 'reel', 'fifteen-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Blu-Ray', 'interactive', 'script', 'gallery', 'conversation', 'Brooks', 'composer', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more', 'Brooks', 'commentary', 'featurette', 'focused', 'Rudd', 'character']",N/A

1342307,A23HLET8WYJ7UA,B003EYVXXC,Eve Callaway,"[0, 1]","Lisa (Reese Witherspoon), a pro softball player, gets dropped from her team and is devastated about it. But she's spent her whole life being a tough gal who refuses to let anything get her down, and she refuses to give into her anger and grief at a major life setback. She sees doing so as self-indulgent and weak.At the same time all of this drama is going on with her life, Lisa has a chance to go out with two very different guys. Matty (Owen Wilson), is a wealthy, major-league pitcher, who beds endless women whom he never gets attached to. He has only one preference: he thinks that fit, young, female athletes make the best bed partners. Matty's empty-headed but cheery and light-hearted approach to life fulfills Lisa's wish that neither she nor anyone else discuss her pain and grief. Matty is more than happy to be an insensitive clod in service of her desire. It's his preferred way of interacting with everyone in his life.George (Paul Rudd), is Lisa's other romantic opportunity. He is currently the fall guy at his father's firm in Washington, D.C. for fraud that he didn't commit. His legal problems lead to getting dumped by his cold-hearted professor girlfriend and fired from his executive job at the family firm. George is perfectly willing to discuss his and Lisa's mutual problems on their first date, which is a blind date set up through one of Lisa's friends. It's a good offer, but Lisa stops him flat. She informs him that her idea of the perfect date is for the two of them to eat in complete silence, which George good-naturedly agrees to do. Amazingly, George, who is a sentimental, idealistic softie, finds Lisa's brusqueness comforting, and he falls hard for her. The only conclusion one can draw given the string of awful people in George's life is that apparently he is a sucker for punishment.Thus begins a long, rather boring odyssey that, in my humble opinion, can only be enjoyed by someone who doesn't particularly like or respect romantic comedy--or popular films in general. The film alternates between presenting George's life and Lisa's, which through most of the film rarely intersects. George wanders from scene to scene, at the mercy of a string of users in his life, most notably (and the obvious progenitor for all of them), his father (Jack Nicholson). Lisa also wanders from scene to scene, at the mercy of her need to avoid feeling disempowered, in the process subjecting herself to a dead-end romantic entanglement with Matty, whom she moves in with not because they are compatible, but simply to use him as an emotional drug to deaden her feelings of loss and despair. In her case as well, the link to how she was raised--and probably coached in a harsh world of sports--has created her tough, warrior persona.I don't have anything against psychological dramas, but I prefer they admit to being dramas, not falsely bill themselves as ""comedy,"" as this film has been marketed. There is barely a moment of comedy in it. There is no witty repartee, no comic surprise, no comic misunderstandings. The only pseudo-comic moment is one, lone pratfall when George slides down the stairs, but that's about it.I am a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon, Jack Nicholson, and Paul Rudd. I've even enjoyed some of Owen Wilson's comedies.

People say they want Hollywood to give them something different and yet when Hollywood does they say it was so bad and not like other romantic comedies, or that Reese took a really bad role that wasn't her fit.

1342311,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003EYVXXC,Grady Harp,"[2, 5]","James L. Brooks has given us some very fine films (Terms of Endearment, As Good As It Gets) and some mediocre (at best) ones - like Spanglish, The Simpsons Movie and numerous TV series.  The odd thing about this much maligned HOW DO YOU KNOW is that it seems to be searching to find a reason for being mad - often to the point of feeling as though Brooks wrote the script as he went. For this viewer the film is not as bad as the audiences and critics say, but it is definitely one of Brooks' memorable works. The characters he created are for the most part losers who manage to get along in life because of an occult optimism. That part is refreshing.Lisa (Reese Witherspoon) is a much loved Pro Softball player whose ego is badly bruised when she is cut from the new team. She dates Matty (Owen Wilson), a wealthy major league baseball pitcher who is either horrifically naive or completely clueless when it comes to relating to Lisa. Concurrently we meet George (Paul Rudd), a bright but emotionally ill-equipped businessman who has just been indicted in his work for his father Charles's (Jack Nicholson) company - apparently for something he did not do. Just as this vulnerable guy needs support he is dumped by his girlfriend and must move out of his place to lesser digs with the help of his devoted assistant Annie (Kathryn Hahn) who is very pregnant but unwed. Lisa meets George on a date arranged by well-meaning friends, but Lisa is 'committed' to Matty.  Some chemistry between Lisa and George develops, Matty makes moves to change and invites Lisa to move in, George and his father duel over the indictment, and finally the 'sort of love' triangle finds a shaky center and Pow! the movie is over.Witherspoon makes the best of her odd role and Paul Rudd restores some glory to his dwindling cinematic repertoire.  Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson, and Jack Nicholson looks like he is one the wrong movie set.  Part of this little film is smart, but it just never quite gels. How do we know? Just watch it with low expectations and be surprised here and there.

1342312,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003EYVXXC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I can't figure out whether this movie is a misstep or if there's something with James L. Brooks' screenplay that I'm not getting, some perspective that sailed over my head. HOW DO YOU KNOW just may be James L. Brooks' weakest theatrical release, and maybe that's not as big a knock when one considers that the guy's only made six movies in his decades-long career. Or, hold up, maybe it IS more damning than if it were the weakest movie in a body of work encompassing, say, thirty theatrical releases. I dunno.It's about two people who meet on the worst day of their lives. It's about 31-year-old Lisa Jorgenson (Witherspoon) who today got cut from the women's national softball team and must now repurpose her life, and it's about George Madison (Rudd) who's barely keeping it together, this beleaguered business executive what's currently being investigated by the Justice Department for security fraud. Their lunch meet affords George his second opportunity to make a bad first impression on Lisa (he'd previously flubbed it over the phone when he called to cancel a blind date). You'd think Lisa and George would part ways permanently once their mostly silent meal was over. But then there wouldn't be a movie.It's my long-harbored liking of Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon that's at war with my lukewarm reaction after having watched the thing. In a lot of ways Paul Rudd owns this movie. His role covers a broader canvas than does Witherspoon's or Owen Wilson's. He plays the neurotic straight man but also finds spaces to provide bits of comic relief. If you enjoy cringing and feeling awkward for a character in a movie, then you'll appreciate what Rudd does here. George Madison is a sweetheart of a guy but the opposite of smooth. My one gripe about George's arc: he was marginalized, too much of a doormat too deep into the film.The cast is just about uniformly terrific, with the possible exception of Jack Nicholson who, in playing Rudd's strident father, settles for channeling his inner Jack Nicholson. I wish Brooks had landed his first choice of Bill Murray. I think he would've been amazing and more interesting.I can never find fault with Reese Witherspoon, never mind that her Lisa tends to spout these self-help platitudes. Owen Wilson, with his laid back approach and off-kilter delivery, mines comic gold as Reese's self-absorbed but surprisingly sweet boyfriend Matty (who also happens to be a major league pitcher). To quote Brooks from the Making Of featurette: ""As played by Owen, Matty gives you the sunny side of narcissism."" Meanwhile, Kathryn Hahn should draw some good chuckles as George's loyal, very pregnant secretary. Tony Shaloub's cameo provides one of the film's infrequent moments of grace. So, no, I won't dis the actors.But here at Casa de Bala, allocating faults is as habitual as sucking in oxygen. I lay blame on James L. Brooks, his direction, his script, something. There's a generic quality here and a sense of inertia, and maybe it's because two of the three leads spend much of the film wallowing in existential dilemma. There sure is a lot of talking. Scenes feel staged. As enjoyable as Wilson's performance is, as much of a sympathetic lovable loser as Paul Rudd is, the film doles out an easy, predictable choice for Reese. What bugs me is that I don't know that the story did enough to earn this particular happy ending. I don't think the guy who won the Lisa Jorgenson sweepstakes did enough. Playdough cannot be that much of a romantic panacea.I like the idea of Rudd and Witherspoon together - yes, partly stemming from my having seen them inOvernight Deliveryyears back - so you can guess my preference in this love triangle. I wish the story had made it a tougher choice for Reese to make. Will a confused soul end up with a free spirit (Wilson) or with a fellow confused soul? It's not long into the movie before you sense the answer. If nothing else, the film gives us two memorable bromides. I wrote down soon as I heard them:- ""We're all just one small adjustment away from making our lives work.""- ""Never drink to feel better; drink to feel even better.""If Rudd and Witherspoon hadn't been enough reason for me to check out this film, then hearing those two things would've been ample compensation. From now on, whenever I throw out those two bits of wisdom, oh, how my friends will think I'm so damn sage. In-crowd, here I come. 3 out of 5 stars.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Filmmakers Commentary with writer/director James L.

I was convinced that a movie with Paul Rudd,Reese Witherspoon and Jack Nicholson had to be better than what I was reading. Let me tell you first and foremost that I was WRONG!This movie was just incredibly boring. You never feel for the characters or care what is going on with them. You know from the get go that if it follows the majority of rom-coms who she will end up with. Witherspoon looked bored all throughout this as if she herself didn't believe in the script. Rudd tries his best but even he can't enlighten an overly long and boring movie. Owen Wilson is well..Owen Wilson. He probably just signed to do this to fill some time. Lastly we have Mr. Jack Nicholson. Jackie my boy, what were you possibly thinking? Maybe he owed James Brooks a favor. His character had nothing to really do here and it was just a waste of a truly talented actor!In all honesty folks..just don't waste your time on this. It is very boring and goes nowhere.

1342321,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003EYVXXC,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[10, 11]","How Do You Know opened in late 2010 to atrocious reviews, arguably worse reactions from audiences, and went on to become a box-office bomb coming nowhere near recouping its $120 budget. This budget has been oft-discussed, as $50 million went for star salaries alone and you'd be hard-pressed to find the other $70 million onscreen. This is the sixth film to be written and directed by James L. Brooks, who works almost exclusively in romantic-comedy and writes some of the most charming, intelligent dialogue one would be pressed to find in the genre. Is it one of his best films? No. But a bad romantic-comedy by Brooks is far better than the average, mass-produced rom-com that hits the multiplex on what seems like a weekly basis. I have issues with the film like all viewers do, but the amount of criticism it's received is unfathomable to me; being a romantic-comedy, it really is better than 90% of the dreck that's released in this genre.Reese Witherspoon is Lisa, a 31-year-old softball player who is adored by her teammates but sees her career coming to a halt because of her age. Trying to start a new phase in her life, she begins dating Matty Reynolds (Owen Wilson), a clueless, womanizing pro-baseball player whose insensitivity she finds oddly charming. George Madison (Paul Rudd) is a young executive who discovers that he's the target of a federal investigation and is informed by his father Charles (Jack Nicholson) that he could be facing a possible indictment. As this is a romantic-comedy, you know that George meets Lisa at this unique crossroad in their lives and falls for her, leaving her torn between Matty and George. Kathryn Hahn co-stars as George's pregnant assistant Annie, who is quite the scene-stealer among these big marquee names.The quality of this film is all about perception, as there's nothing inarguably good about it. Its quality comes completely from how you respond to the material and how well you think the material is performed. If you look at the negative reviews (and there are many) you will see comments like it's ""boring,"" ""too long,"" ""has unlikable characters,"" etc. I did not feel this way at all, which leaves me firmly in the minority. If the film has one big flaw it is probably the characterization. Brooks is a good writer but his creation of the central characters is heavily flawed here, particularly in the relationship between Lisa and Matty. It's hard to see why Lisa would be attracted to Matty let alone why she would continue to actively pursue a relationship with him, as he remains a static character throughout the film. Despite this, their relationship takes up a significant portion of screen-time. Lisa is a strong, fairly intelligent female protagonist but her intelligence becomes questionable due to her taste in men. It takes a while before she warms up to flawed, but extremely loveable George, yet she likes Matty almost immediately. With that said, I didn't find these characters unlikable as they are played by actors charming enough to off-set any un-likability. Even though his character's relationship with Lisa makes little sense, Wilson carries his role very well and is responsible for some of the film's funniest moments. Even with weak characterization, Brooks' characters seem more developed, multi-dimensional, and intelligent than the usual caricatures that populate these types of films.Witherspoon is a capable actress, adorable as Lisa and Rudd is an actor of intense likability and immense charm. The two have a very cute, believable chemistry together that likely stems from how likable they are separately and their relationship develops in a somewhat unconventional manner. I'd like to see them work together again, as they are the heart and soul of the film. Of course, you can't not discuss the legend that is Jack Nicholson, an actor of such greatness his mere presence in a movie can bring a smile to your face. Reuniting with Brooks for the fourth time, Nicholson is playing a creep but he's still Jack and it's hard to hate him. His first scene, in which he angrily rants at George to the chagrin of Annie, brought me great pleasure and solidified for me why Jack has reached a level of such legend that people know who you're talking about when you say his first name. Many have complained that Nicholson sleepwalks through the role on the basis that he's Jack Nicholson and doesn't need to deliver a performance; but I found Jack to be one of the highlights of the film. He's not in many scenes, but I found his facial expressions and dialogue some of the most grin-inducing moments. Finally, Hahn is a scene-stealer as the really sweet, down-to-earth Annie who brings an earthy quality to the more high-class, problematic proceedings. It's a joy to watch.At 117 (without end credits), How Do You Know is longer than the typical romantic-comedy but I never felt it was being drawn out or becoming too long. The first time I saw it, I was aware of its length but untroubled by it. The second time, I remained blissfully unaware of the length. While many have failed to recognize it, Brooks still has a knack for writing wonderfully warm, comedic scenes. The hospital scene is a great piece of writing and execution, with Nicholson's entrance being hilarious in a low-key sort of way. Also, Rudd's ""Play-Doh"" speech is adorable and another wonderful example of Brooks' writing. Essentially, I found this film just like the actors that inhabit it; charming and likable. It may not be ""great,"" but I enjoyed it much more than I expected to and it left a big, goofy smile on my face.I don't believe that what I've written will change the opinions of those who have already seen it. I can offer nothing to sway those people to agree with me; but hopefully this shows that there are people out there who actually really like this film and are unable to comprehend the vitriol some people have for it. I can't recommend this film to any particular demographic or promise that you'll feel as I do about it...But I hope you do. If you enjoy this movie as much as I do, you're in for quite a treat.GRADE: B",4,An Unjustly Panned Romantic-Comedy from James L.

As others have noted, the writing felt flat, and the performances forced. I think the real culprit was just a complete lack of chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and both her co-stars. I felt slightly more of a spark between her and Owen Wilson, or at least some mutual affection, but considering the fact that Paul Rudd's character is supposed to be challenging that in a love triangle, the complete lack of chemistry between he and Reese just really sunk the film. I think Owen turned in the best performance of the film, and was genuinely charming, but he couldn't save the film. Both Reese and Rudd just felt so forced, and like they were overacting.

The average comedy today seems to consistently feature emotionally immature, narcissistic boy-men, and women who are trying to be tough at work but are insecure and confused about how to have any kind of grown-up relationship.  The characters are virtually interchangeable from one movie to another. Since I'm an avid movie-lover, I'm not that hard to please, but am too often left cold or indifferent.Then along comes this supposedly ""bad"" movie, which I finally Netflixed since I like the director. It has characters I DID care about, and I wanted to give it 41/2 stars in contrast to what's out there. Life thas thrown Lisa and George some curve balls (pun intended), but they are BOTH striving to be caring and self-responsible people (how retro!) and figure out how to move on with their lives. I loved the performances of Reese and Paul (just watching their faces change was delicious), and I agree with another reviewer that Owen found a deeper layer too. Jack was Jack. I was particularly taken with the attention paid to supporting characters and the unique friendship George had with pregnant and emotional Annie.  The hospital scene was moving and funny, worth watching the movie to see.  But there were many little treats along the way.  e.g. 1) Lisa's attempts to rise above her pain with post-it-note slogans,like she did in baseball. 2) the power of silence at the restaurant (what, not even text messaging?) etc.I am buying this movie, and hope they don't give up making little gems like this.  My scales have already tipped to independent and foreign films, so Hollywood is way behind in the battle for my dollar.

1342334,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003EYVXXC,Mark Turner,"[3, 7]","The romantic comedy has taken some serious hits over the past few years. What was once a major staple of a night out at the movies is slowly dissolving into a thing of the past. Lets fact it, the bad examples of this genre far outweigh the good. But the majority fall into that middle of the road category, the one where the movie isn't quite that bad but it's also not one you'll watch again. Such is the case with HOW DO YOU KNOW.Directed and written by James Brooks, the man behind AS GOOD AS IT GETS, BROADCAST NEWS and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT (sorry but I never liked this one no matter how many people love it), what we have is a movie that looks good with great stars but that leaves you with little to remember or recommend. The movie revolves around two major characters. Lisa (Reese Witherspoon) is a professional woman's baseball star hoping to get on the roster of the latest USA team. She doesn't make it and in a slump ends up trying something new by getting involved with a pro baseball player named Matty (Owen Wilson).Prior to her involvement, Lisa was supposed to go on a blind date with George (Paul Rudd), a young Wall Street exec, who cancels their date on the phone since he's involved with someone already. That all changes when George becomes the target of a Federal investigation at company he works for, owned by his father Charles (Jack Nicholson). Down on his luck, his girlfriend dumps him to concentrate on her own needs.Lisa's involvement with Matty is everywhere. One minute they're fine, the next they part ways. During one of those times apart, she finally meets with George for a dinner date. For George it's love at first sight. He adores everything about Lisa. Unfortunately the feelings aren't reciprocated and she goes back to Matty after a phone call.These two characters keep bouncing back and forth into each other's lives through the whole film. Things look well and then Matty does something stupid in the most stereotypical dumb jock mode there is. Lisa leaves and then later comes back, hoping for the best. All the while George sits to the side hoping that Lisa will leave Matty and he might get the opportunity he botched with that first phone call.The movie is mainly about Lisa and her search for love. And when she thinks she's found it she's never quite sure if it's really love, infatuation or just what it is. Thus the title of the film.So here's the thing. This cast, as I said, looks great. They perform quite well. But while I might like the characters I never feel involved with any of them. They all seem too self-absorbed in their own problems and when they do decide to consider someone else they almost always mess it up. Sure, life is messy but this is a movie, a comedy no less. I want to be entertained and not sit there uninvolved with the main characters. The only one I found myself caring about was George's secretary who knows what's going on at the office but can't tell him and wants to so badly.The movie is beautiful to look at. It's well photographed and the sets look delicious. These are streets you find yourself wanting to walk down. But no matter how good the photography or the sets, a story needs to be presented that you enjoy. It never happens.Brooks has shown some incredibly deep movies. He's made us look deeper into worlds we never visit and makes them interesting. He's made us invest in characters and their lives, hoping against all hope that they survive everything he throws at them. But here, it's just kind of bland. It's not boring but when it finishes you just feel sort of empty.When released all everyone could talk about was the cost to make this picture. The stars were paid astronomical sums. Brooks ran over budget shooting and reshooting pieces. The fear was that the movie wouldn't make back what was invested in it and those fears came true.

1342336,A3NI800P6Q6YNS,B003EYVXXC,Matthew J. Gallagher,"[7, 9]","First, any James L. Brooks film is worth viewing, if only because he is one of the few Hollywood directors who is interested in the problems of adults, and because the best of his films, ""Broadcast News,"" ""Terms of Endearment,"" do a believable and intelligent balancing act between light humor, moving drama, and outright comedic fare, that is also represented in his other brilliant creations, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" and ""The Simpsons."" The critics certainly sharpened their knives over what is, at least, a more than pleasant romantic comedy, that features an often smart, moving, and funny script and probably Owen Wilson's best performance to date as a self-absorbed, but lovable jock, who plays for the Washington Nationals. His competition for the affections of Reese Witherspoon, as radiant here as ever, is Paul Rudd, playing a decent fellow, falsely accused of tax fraud, who has the ultimate nefarious father, played by Jack Nicholson, always a welcome addition to any film.  As the DVD commentary with Wilson and Brooks points out, it is really two movies - with Wilson and Witherspoon's turbulent, but sexy relationship, and she and Rudd's warmer, deeper relationship well developed over a series of often funny and touching scenes that will be relatable to anyone who is attempting to balance both professional and personal aims at the same time - and never exactly knowing if you are doing it quite right - hence the title. Part of the charm of the script is, in Brook's words, ""making decency sexy,"" and each of the three characters, in their own way, is truly decent, even Wilson's philandering jock is redeemed by his sincere devotion to Witherspoon, who is trying to get over her own professional disappointment, and find a life that will truly make her happy.  The smart script, crisp direction, beautiful cinematography, and wonderful score, which will remind you of the wonderful music that also underscored ""Broadcast News"" and ""Terms of Endearment"" is first rate. The movie may run a tad too long, the script could be tighter in places, and Rudd's performance was problematic for me: he relies too much on the gimmicky acting he does in films like ""I Love You, Man,"" when this performance really calls for him to be more of a man, with a sincerity and depth that often eludes him, but Reese Witherspoon is terrific, fully believable as an Olympic softball player, and beautiful, natural, and funny in all the right places. This was a FAR better movie than the critics gave it credit for, with Anthony Lane, in The New Yorker, actually calling it a ""bad"" movie, while he gives credit to far less worthier films than this. This is a good quality romantic comedy for adults and it has, at moments, exquisite moments of grace, especially the soulful ending, and laugh out loud situations, which is very difficult to achieve in a romantic comedy.  I thought it was a breath of fresh air.  It's never vulgar, always intelligent, and, at times, quite moving. I honestly wish Brooks was making more films because I think his decent, wry, and compassionate way of looking at people is sorely missed at the cineplex. ""How Do You Know"" may not be top drawer Brooks, but it is awfully close, and it one of the more rewarding romantic comedies I have seen in quite awhile.

Witherspoon's character is very poorly drawn.  She is supposed to be a tough, top athlete who knows what she wants and who has strong leadership abilities, but when she unexpectedly loses out in a bid for an athletic spot, it's as though she suddenly becomes indecisive, ditzy,  and unable to manage her own life.  Her character is hardly believable, and the combination between her acerbic personality and her constantly confused look makes her not only unappealing but boring.  Witherspoon's talent and beauty are wasted on this character.  Owen Wilson plays a more endearing but still cardboard-cutout character who is mainly needed as a contrast with Rudd.  Wilson is fun to watch in this movie but has still not been given enough to do from an acting standpoint; he too is capable of much more.  The only characterization that is consistently worth watching is that of Paul Rudd, who plays the range between comedic and compelling with authentic charisma.  He is a one-man show, but he can't hold this one up all by himself.  If the movie were mostly about him, it might fly, but the other characters are so poorly developed that it really doesn't.  Overall, I would give this movie a 2.5, primarily for Rudd's performance.

When I first watched this film I didn't like some of the characters but halfway through I realized that this was because the characters were done so well. It's hard to know which guy she would choose because each one had things going for them. And the Witherspoon character herself has some flaws that made her unattractive but after some thought I feel it just gave her more texture in the tale. There are a lot of male/female issues here, some that are like land mines you don't want to bring up. Heh. Some people will complain that the film was too slow but the reason for that is because the film people are trying to build up the emotions. The two best scenes were the gifts giving to her for her b-day (one gift tipped the scales and convinced her to go with that guy) and the other was when she and the other was when she and a guy acted out a love tale in front of two people who had forgotten what they had said to each other. Alan Brooks delivers another grand film but it would appear most of the audience wanted something dumbed down with lots of laughs and no depth. Jack Nicholsan doesn't seem to contribute as much as I would have expected. The budget was $120M but it yielded only a bit over $48M at the Box Office.

It failed to tell us anything new about love, failed to give us characters that we should care about, and most important it failed to deliver laughs.

This baffles me. This wonderful picture from the great James L. Brooks does, for me at least (and apparently I am alone on this one), everything a great film should do. It engaged me emotionally and intellectually, I related to the characters and their problems, I found it to be human and funny and their struggles were timely. Brooks' film is an ode to those who are just off center of making their lives work and I found it next to irresistible. Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, Owen Wilson and Jack Nicholson are all terrific here, delivering witty, honest and well rounded performances. The film is nicely directed, beautifully shot and attentively written. In a year when films have to be all high concept and surreal images trump character and motivation (yes, I'm looking at you ""Inception"" and ""Black Swan""), ""How Do You Know"" is a lovely breath of fresh air.

It leaves them open to smart-ass film critics who then use that same question against them while writing their reviews. Of course, if the film were good, this wouldn't be a problem.James L. Brooks, the once great writer - director of such films as ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Broadcast News"", is not the most prolific filmmaker; he has only made three films in thirteen years. Of these films, only one can be considered good. So when he makes a bad film, it really sticks out. You have to ask yourself ""this piece of crap was made by the same person who made ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""As Good As It Gets""?"" Very soon, our first statement about his films might be ""Aah, another film from the guy who made ""I'll Do Anything"", ""Spanglish"" and ...""""How Do You Know"" (Okay. Technically, not a question, but close enough) is the newest film starring Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson. Written and directed by Brooks, it is a phenomenally bad film and an incredible waste of talent.How do you know a promising actress has made a bad mistake? Witherspoon plays Lisa, a member of the USA Softball Team who gets cut. At 31, this throws her into a tailspin and she begins to reevaluate her life. As a member of the team, she states she is going to stop dating professional athletes. As soon as she is cut, she jumps into bed with Matty (Wilson), a professional baseball player and full-time lothario. Because Lisa knows Matty is a player, and still enters into a relationship with him, she seems desperate and needy completely contradicting the strong, independent image she is meant to convey. Worse, after her initial ""encounter"" with Matty, she quickly learns the truth about him. Instead of walking out, never to return, she justifies his behavior by returning to him. Of course, if she walked out on him, there would be no reason to watch the movie. On second thought, maybe that isn't such a bad thing.How do you know you should stay away from a movie? If Owen Wilson is one of the stars, it's a pretty safe bet. Has this guy made any good films recently? In the last five years? Sure, he was memorable in ""Meet the Parents"", but that was a small role. His last memorable (good?) starring role was ""Wedding Crashers"" in 2005. Before that, ""Minus Man"" in 1999. Everything else has been dreadful, a supporting role or a voice in a cartoon (""Cars""). Wilson does the same shtick in every role and it wears thin very quickly. It becomes almost impossible to sit and watch him.How do you know a film is in trouble? When Paul Rudd begins to flounder around trying to create some desperately needed laughs. To be honest, Rudd basically does the same shtick in just about every film as well. But he has a better track record and his work seems lighter and funnier. Rudd plays George, a commodities broker (?) who works for his dad, Charles (Jack Nicholson). As the film begins, George is subpoenaed and may be indicted for financial shenanigans. This causes him to become rudderless and desperate. During all of this, he contacts Lisa and asks her on a blind date. The date doesn't go well, he is a little preoccupied, so he flounders around a bit and tries to figure out what is going wrong with his life. Naturally, this is when he decides a new relationship is just the ticket. As if his life weren't stressful enough. There is a certain amount of ""movie-cute"" in his character, but he is also significantly overwrought. And because we never understand what his character is accused of doing (despite the lengthy narrative - halting explanations to try and enlighten us) it is difficult to follow along or muster any sympathy.How do you know a great actor is bored? When Jack Nicholson takes on the thankless, unfunny, uninteresting role of Charles, George's dad. The most remarkable thing about this character is that Nicholson plays him. Throughout the film, Charles makes an appearance, has a discussion with his son, mugs for the camera and leaves. It is jaw dropping, but in the wrong way.How do you know a film just isn't going to work on any level? Some of the people, any of the people, who read the script before production began should've pointed out to Brooks' that none of the characters are likable. That is a big problem in a romantic comedy. Lisa just seems weak and pathetic making it difficult to get behind her character, to root for her. Matty isn't supposed to be likable and we get that from the beginning. So why does Lisa fall for him? George is supposed to be the hero, but he is so distraught and anxious throughout, it is difficult to stand watching him. I think it would be hard for anyone to say ""Let's invite George to dinner. He would be a great addition to the conversation"". We can't stand George, or anyone else, so it is difficult to like anyone.How do you know ""How Do You Know"" is a dreadful film to be avoided at all costs? As you watch the film, time seems to slow down; the movie eventually feels longer than it actually is.

If a moviegoer doesn't know people like the characters in this movie, it is easy to see how they wouldn't enjoy the film. How could they?

After her life takes a drastic turn Lisa (Witherspoon) tries to start over with new boyfriend Matty (Wilson).  Businessman George's (Paul Rudd) life is also falling apart.  A chance meeting between the two has the potential of helping them both through thier problems.  Although this is a pretty standard chick-flick it's a lot better then most.  This is a movie that is 100% depended on the characters, and the casting again makes this movie better then it really could have been.  Reese Witherspoon's part at first seems basic, but an actress like her as a way of taking a complex part and making it seem that way.  Owen Wilson plays a guy so unlikeable you really hope he suffers.  Paul Rudd also plays a complex character that is overly likeable.  Jack Nicholson plays Rudd's dad, and the biggest complaint I have with the movie is that he's not in it enough.  This movie does something that is hard to do, a funny, romantic comedy that is enjoyable for both men and women.  I think that a lot of that has to do with the casting.  I give it a B.Would I watch again? - I think I actually would.",3,"A chick flick both men & women will enjoy. An OK movie made better by the casting choices, just needed more Jack.

1342365,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003EYVXXC,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 10]","Written and directed by James L. Brooks, it is only natural that ""How Do You Know"" looks like an amusing and intelligent romantic comedy. Almost all characters are nice and likable (played by Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson), and the only person that may not be very likable is lent considerable charm by the person who plays him, Jack Nicholson. Too bad that the end result does not live up to the expectations we get from the cast.Reese Witherspoon is Lisa, a pro softball player recently cut from the national team. Paul Rudd is George, a corporate executive facing possible federal indictment for what he doesn't know anything about. It was the worst day of their lives and Lisa and George meet each other. Lisa also meets a playboy Matty, a Washington Nationals pitcher played by Owen Wilson. And Matty thinks he has fallen in love with her for real, just as the now down-and-out George does.""How Do You Know"" begins with a typical romantic-comedy set-up. The entire cast tries hard to invest their characters with some depth, but without much success. I was having a hard time trying to understand who they are and what they really want to do, especially the heroine Lisa. She is confused, doesn't know what to do, but her confusion is not fun to see. Her character is just boring, even though played by Reese Witherspoon.Some may call the film an off-beat comedy. Each off-beat comedy has its own rhythm and tempo, which I couldn't find in ""How Do You Know,"" except in some brief but amusing scenes such as Lisa visiting a psychiatrist (cameo by Tony Shalhoub), or Annie, a pregnant assistant (Kathryn Hahn). These good parts have little to do with the romantic triangle of the three leads. Even though his charisma is intact, Jack Nicolson's underwritten character is not memorable and the subplot about his father (and boss)-and-son conflict with Paul Rudd's George only drags.In short ""How Do You Know"" is a huge disappointment especially when it is from the director of ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""As Good As It Gets.""",2,"Disapppointing Romantic Comedy from the Director of ""As Good As It Gets""",1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,2041,"['Written', 'directed', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'only', 'natural', 'How', 'Do', 'Know', 'amusing', 'intelligent', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Almost', 'characters', 'are', 'nice', 'likable', 'played', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'only', 'person', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'likable', 'lent', 'considerable', 'charm', 'person', 'who', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Too', 'bad', 'end', 'result', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'get', 'cast.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Lisa', 'pro', 'softball', 'player', 'recently', 'cut', 'national', 'team', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'George', 'corporate', 'executive', 'facing', 'possible', 'federal', 'indictment', 'what', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'was', 'worst', 'day', 'lives', 'Lisa', 'George', 'meet', 'other', 'Lisa', 'also', 'playboy', 'Matty', 'Washington', 'Nationals', 'pitcher', 'played', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Matty', 'fallen', 'love', 'real', 'just', 'now', 'down-and-out', 'George', 'How', 'Do', 'Know', 'typical', 'romantic-comedy', 'set-up', 'entire', 'cast', 'tries', 'hard', 'invest', 'characters', 'depth', 'much', 'success', 'was', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'trying', 'understand', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'especially', 'heroine', 'Lisa', 'confused', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'confusion', 'not', 'fun', 'see', 'character', 'just', 'boring', 'even', 'played', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon.Some', 'may', 'call', 'film', 'off-beat', 'comedy', 'off-beat', 'comedy', 'own', 'rhythm', 'tempo', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'How', 'Do', 'Know', 'brief', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'such', 'Lisa', 'visiting', 'psychiatrist', 'cameo', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'Annie', 'pregnant', 'assistant', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'good', 'parts', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'three', 'leads', 'Even', 'charisma', 'intact', 'Jack', 'Nicolson', 'underwritten', 'character', 'not', 'memorable', 'subplot', 'father', 'boss', 'conflict', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'George', 'only', 'short', 'How', 'Do', 'Know', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'especially', 'when', 'director', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'As', 'Good']",N/A
