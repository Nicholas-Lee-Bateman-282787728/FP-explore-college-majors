I guess that is the reason that most of reviewers gave low scores to this magnificent documentary. They just want to see the undeniable interesting scenes of the actual ship on the sea bottom. I want that too.But Titanica is above all an excellent History of the Titanic AND its time. I think that is the best achievement of this DVD: to put the Titanic and what happened to her into an historical context so we can understand the reasons and the meaning of this human tragedy.This said I think Leonard Nimoy narration, music and visual material are top notch. I recommend this Titanica to anyone with and interest above the understandable curiosity for the actual wreckage scenes.",5,It has become a circus,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,787,"['Titanic', 'wreckage', 'lost', 'human', 'scientific', 'meaning', 'should', 'have', 'become', 'just', 'show', 'guess', 'reason', 'most', 'reviewers', 'gave', 'low', 'scores', 'magnificent', 'documentary', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'undeniable', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'actual', 'ship', 'sea', 'bottom', 'want', 'too.But', 'Titanica', 'excellent', 'History', 'Titanic', 'time', 'think', 'best', 'achievement', 'DVD', 'put', 'Titanic', 'what', 'happened', 'historical', 'context', 'can', 'understand', 'reasons', 'meaning', 'human', 'tragedy.This', 'said', 'think', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'narration', 'music', 'visual', 'material', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'recommend', 'Titanica', 'anyone', 'interest', 'understandable', 'curiosity', 'actual', 'wreckage', 'scenes']",Titanica
181353,A1IBC9XP2LICQL,1558908676,A. Wolverton,"[5, 7]","'Titanica' documents the efforts to film and salvage some of the remains from the Titanic wreckage.  How the scientists are able to take themselves to the ship in and of itself is an interesting story, but too much time is spent on that aspect.  Tension develops as scientists argue among themselves over what artifacts should and shouldn't be brought back to the surface.  Unfortunately, that scene is about as exciting as it gets.The history of the ship and its fateful voyage is adequately covered, but I would have enjoyed hearing more information from the two survivors who were interviewed.  Like all the IMAX DVDs, 'Titanica' ultimately suffers from being forced onto a small screen.  The information presented is somewhat useful and moderately interesting, but the small format of a television screen (no matter how large your home entertainment center stretches) just can't inspire the awe that viewers experience in an IMAX theatre.",2,"Not Enough Story, Not Enough Screen",1002758400,"10 11, 2001",2001,942,"[""'Titanica"", 'documents', 'efforts', 'film', 'salvage', 'remains', 'Titanic', 'wreckage', 'How', 'scientists', 'are', 'able', 'take', 'ship', 'interesting', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'aspect', 'Tension', 'scientists', 'argue', 'over', 'what', 'artifacts', 'should', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'surface', 'Unfortunately', 'scene', 'as', 'exciting', 'history', 'ship', 'fateful', 'voyage', 'adequately', 'covered', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'more', 'information', 'two', 'survivors', 'who', 'were', 'interviewed', 'IMAX', 'DVDs', ""'Titanica"", 'ultimately', 'suffers', 'being', 'forced', 'small', 'screen', 'information', 'presented', 'somewhat', 'useful', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'small', 'format', 'television', 'screen', 'matter', 'how', 'large', 'home', 'entertainment', 'center', 'stretches', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'awe', 'viewers', 'experience', 'IMAX', 'theatre']",Titanica
181354,A3PAHM8VNML9F6,1558908676,"Karen ""Karen""","[5, 7]","This IMAX DVD is very disappointing.  Much of it consists of old newsreel footage and still images of the Titanic rather than the stunning IMAX photography I was expecting.  There is even quite a bit of time devoted to images of the submersible crews looking out their window and operating the subs.  If you are looking for a short, semi-documentary on the Titanic, this might appeal to you, but if you are looking for IMAX images of the ship then this DVD is a total flop.",1,Save your money,1000080000,"09 10, 2001",2001,473,"['IMAX', 'DVD', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Much', 'old', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'still', 'images', 'Titanic', 'rather', 'stunning', 'IMAX', 'photography', 'was', 'expecting', 'even', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'devoted', 'images', 'submersible', 'crews', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'operating', 'subs', 'are', 'looking', 'short', 'semi-documentary', 'Titanic', 'might', 'appeal', 'are', 'looking', 'IMAX', 'images', 'ship', 'then', 'DVD', 'total', 'flop']",Titanica

Now, I didn't expect the visuals to match those of the big screen (that's why IMAX is what it is), but I was appalled by the &quot;blue-light special&quot; editing job.  While the original theatrical release was some 90 minutes long, this DVD was only an hour long, yet it somehow boasted &quot;additional footage&quot;!  The result is a version of Titanica-lite that skips a LOT of footage, both underwater as well as biological and scientific insights courtesy of the Russian crew.  This is very, very disappointing, seeing as this now feels like half a documentary.",3,What happened?,1081900800,"04 14, 2004",2004,650,"['remember', 'loving', 'IMAX', 'release', 'Titanica', 'finally', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'Now', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'visuals', 'match', 'big', 'screen', 'why', 'IMAX', 'what', 'was', 'appalled', 'quot', 'blue-light', 'special', 'quot', 'editing', 'job', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'DVD', 'was', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'somehow', 'boasted', 'quot', 'additional', 'footage', 'quot', 'result', 'version', 'Titanica-lite', 'LOT', 'footage', 'underwater', 'as', 'well', 'biological', 'scientific', 'insights', 'courtesy', 'Russian', 'crew', 'very', 'very', 'disappointing', 'seeing', 'now', 'documentary']",Titanica
181356,A2YTSOE0BJDSEH,1558908676,"Robert Morris ""phase52001""","[20, 21]","I have seen 3 versions of this Imax film. The first was the 90 min long videotape version. The second was the 45 minute theatre version, (as it was shown in Australia), which was basically a cut down version of the video,  concentrating on the ocean floor and looking at the wreck, and this newly  re-edited 67 minute DVD version. When I purchased the DVD I thought I was  getting a DVD copy of the 90 min videotape version. This DVD is a  completely re-edited and updated and DIFFERENT version of both the video  and the theatrical versions I saw. The video of Titanica is a complete Imax  film. The DVD contains numerous new interviews, all shot on video(! ),  lots of old photos and film footage from the era, and while it contains  Imax film footage, it doesn't end up looking and feeling and sounding like  an Imax film. (And some of the Imax film included on this DVD is quiet  scartchy in parts). All that said, it is a good update and does tell the  story of the Titanic quiet well. Which is the main diffence between this  DVD and the video. The video tells the story of the Titanic from the point  of view of the Russian/Americam/Imax expedition sent in to film it, and  spends a lot of time on the ocean floor, the DVD is more an overall account  of the Titanic with the expedition included in the story. Its a great  supplement to the video version, but not really as good. If you can afford  it, try to get both, if not, go for the 90 minute videotape version, its  far more intersting, the comparsion of the Russian and American attitudes  to the Titanic site far more revealing and it has a lot more of that  incredible Imax footage which gives you more of the feeling of actually  being at the bottom of the Atlantic. I would have preferred to see the new  footage either added to the original cut of the 90 minute video version or  as an additional feature included on the DVD or perhaps BOTH versions could  have been included on the DVD. And nothing against Mr.Leonard Nimoy but why  was he allowed to say &quot;In Search Of ...&quot;; and why did this DVD  version need to have its narration re-recorded; Cedric Smith did a fine job  on the video version.",3,A New Re-Edited Updated and SHORTER Version of TITANICA,950918400,"02 19, 2000",2000,2175,"['have', 'seen', '3', 'versions', 'Imax', 'film', 'first', 'was', '90', 'min', 'long', 'videotape', 'version', 'second', 'was', '45', 'minute', 'theatre', 'version', 'was', 'shown', 'Australia', 'was', 'basically', 'cut', 'down', 'version', 'video', 'concentrating', 'ocean', 'floor', 'looking', 'wreck', 'newly', 're-edited', '67', 'minute', 'DVD', 'version', 'When', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'getting', 'DVD', 'copy', '90', 'min', 'videotape', 'version', 'DVD', 'completely', 're-edited', 'updated', 'DIFFERENT', 'version', 'video', 'theatrical', 'versions', 'saw', 'video', 'Titanica', 'complete', 'Imax', 'film', 'DVD', 'numerous', 'new', 'interviews', 'shot', 'video', 'lots', 'old', 'photos', 'film', 'footage', 'era', 'Imax', 'film', 'footage', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'feeling', 'sounding', 'Imax', 'film', 'Imax', 'film', 'included', 'DVD', 'quiet', 'scartchy', 'parts', 'said', 'good', 'update', 'tell', 'story', 'Titanic', 'quiet', 'well', 'main', 'diffence', 'DVD', 'video', 'video', 'story', 'Titanic', 'point', 'view', 'Russian/Americam/Imax', 'expedition', 'sent', 'film', 'lot', 'time', 'ocean', 'floor', 'DVD', 'more', 'overall', 'account', 'Titanic', 'expedition', 'included', 'story', 'great', 'supplement', 'video', 'version', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'can', 'afford', 'try', 'get', 'not', 'go', '90', 'minute', 'videotape', 'version', 'far', 'more', 'intersting', 'comparsion', 'Russian', 'American', 'attitudes', 'Titanic', 'site', 'far', 'more', 'revealing', 'lot', 'more', 'incredible', 'Imax', 'footage', 'more', 'feeling', 'actually', 'being', 'bottom', 'Atlantic', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'new', 'footage', 'either', 'added', 'original', 'cut', '90', 'minute', 'video', 'version', 'additional', 'feature', 'included', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'BOTH', 'versions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'Mr.Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'why', 'was', 'allowed', 'say', 'quot', 'Search', 'quot', 'why', 'did', 'DVD', 'version', 'need', 'have', 'narration', 're-recorded', 'Cedric', 'Smith', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'video', 'version']",Titanica
