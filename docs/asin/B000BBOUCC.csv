939725,ADOUBP7AMWGKU,B000BBOUCC,,"[1, 2]","I don't know why this film got such lousy reviews. Folks are reviewing it like it was supposed to be Citizen Cain or something. Come on people - this is a Rob Schneider movie! It's supposed to be stupid. It's supposed to be infantile. It's supposed to be insulting to our intelligence. I can't understand why people go to a movie like this expecting some sort of Woody Allen style level of literacy. That isn't what this sort of film is about. Get used to it.Now, with that out of the way, on to the movie. I think there are a number of elements that really made it work for me.First, Deuce himself is a guy it's impossible not to like. He wanders through the film in a cheery daze, almost blissfully unaware of what is going on around him. At times he comes across as incredibly thick but the general impression I had of him was that he was just remarkably naive. Deuce was an innocent abroad, big of heart and dim of wit, and ultimately oddly sweet. I know Rob Schneider got the ""Worst Actor Award"" at the Razzies, but I really believe that he played this part perfectly. I certainly had no problem accepting that his character was anything other than the kindly hearted loser that Schneider portrayed him to be.Second, Eddie Griffin absolutely stole the show as Deuce's old pimp TJ. With more material to work with than in the last film he absolutely shines as an absolutely repulsive yet loveable individual. The scene where he spills some french fries in a toilet is hilarious, and the scene with the cat (""You love them big hairy balls don't you?"") had me in an agony of laughter. I showed that scene to my elderly mother and she laughed harder than I've seen her laugh in years. Finally, TJ's attempts to dissuade his fellow prisoners from getting amorous with him by talking about his glass-eating carnival days was inspired. I must remember to use that line if I'm ever in a similar situation.Third, the Man-Whores of Europe were terribly funny - especially the Scotsman, the Indian and Little Kim (the asian Man-Whore). The Indian guy was hilarious with his variety of reasons why he was not out man-whoring (having been scared off by the man-whore killer). His version of ""the dog ate my homework"" as an excuse slew me.Finally, the She-Johns, though not as funny as the ones in the first film, were still pretty cool. The woman with the tracheotomy hole was wonderfully sickening, and the one with the singularly alarming nose was scary, but oddly cute at the same time. I had the feeling that the whole point to the She-Johns in this film, as in the first, was that regardless of how you look, you can still be a wonderful person and worthy of love.Unlike your typical sequel, this film was not a rehash of the original. Yes, there is the sub-plot involving Deuce's awkward adventures with the She-Johns, but where that was most of the plot to the first film, it is incidental here. Where the first film was one long running gag about a loser becoming a gigolo and succeeding at it because he was a loser, the sequel is more about cramming as many jokes into a small space as possible. And it succeeds. True, it isn't food for the brain - but who cares? If you watch this movie for laughs you won't be disappointed.",5,Magnificently stupid film - Deserving of cult status!,1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,3227,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'film', 'got', 'such', 'lousy', 'reviews', 'Folks', 'are', 'reviewing', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Citizen', 'Cain', 'something', 'Come', 'people', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'stupid', 'supposed', 'be', 'infantile', 'supposed', 'be', 'insulting', 'intelligence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'sort', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'style', 'level', 'literacy', ""n't"", 'what', 'sort', 'film', 'about', 'Get', 'used', 'it.Now', 'way', 'movie', 'think', 'are', 'number', 'elements', 'really', 'made', 'work', 'me.First', 'Deuce', 'guy', 'impossible', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'cheery', 'daze', 'almost', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'what', 'going', 'times', 'incredibly', 'thick', 'general', 'impression', 'had', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'remarkably', 'naive', 'Deuce', 'was', 'innocent', 'abroad', 'big', 'heart', 'dim', 'wit', 'ultimately', 'oddly', 'sweet', 'know', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'got', 'Worst', 'Actor', 'Award', 'Razzies', 'really', 'believe', 'played', 'part', 'perfectly', 'certainly', 'had', 'problem', 'accepting', 'character', 'was', 'anything', 'other', 'kindly', 'hearted', 'loser', 'Schneider', 'portrayed', 'be.Second', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'absolutely', 'stole', 'show', 'Deuce', 'old', 'pimp', 'TJ', 'more', 'material', 'work', 'last', 'film', 'absolutely', 'absolutely', 'repulsive', 'yet', 'loveable', 'individual', 'scene', 'where', 'french', 'fries', 'toilet', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'cat', 'love', 'big', 'hairy', 'balls', 'do', ""n't"", 'had', 'agony', 'laughter', 'showed', 'scene', 'elderly', 'mother', 'laughed', 'harder', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'laugh', 'years', 'Finally', 'TJ', 'attempts', 'dissuade', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'getting', 'amorous', 'talking', 'glass-eating', 'carnival', 'days', 'was', 'inspired', 'must', 'remember', 'use', 'line', ""'m"", 'ever', 'similar', 'situation.Third', 'Man-Whores', 'Europe', 'were', 'terribly', 'funny', 'especially', 'Scotsman', 'Indian', 'Little', 'Kim', 'asian', 'Man-Whore', 'Indian', 'guy', 'was', 'hilarious', 'variety', 'reasons', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'man-whoring', 'having', 'been', 'scared', 'off', 'man-whore', 'killer', 'version', 'dog', 'ate', 'homework', 'excuse', 'slew', 'me.Finally', 'She-Johns', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'ones', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'still', 'pretty', 'cool', 'woman', 'tracheotomy', 'hole', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'sickening', 'one', 'singularly', 'alarming', 'nose', 'was', 'scary', 'oddly', 'cute', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'feeling', 'whole', 'point', 'She-Johns', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'regardless', 'how', 'look', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'wonderful', 'person', 'worthy', 'typical', 'sequel', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'rehash', 'original', 'Yes', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Deuce', 'awkward', 'adventures', 'She-Johns', 'where', 'was', 'most', 'plot', 'first', 'film', 'incidental', 'here', 'Where', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'long', 'running', 'gag', 'loser', 'becoming', 'gigolo', 'succeeding', 'was', 'loser', 'sequel', 'more', 'about', 'cramming', 'many', 'jokes', 'small', 'space', 'possible', 'True', ""n't"", 'food', 'brain', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

939727,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000BBOUCC,,"[2, 4]","I was curious about this movie for one reason, and one reason only: the prominent position it holds in Roger Ebert's new (and wonderful) book ""Your Movie Sucks."" Ebert does not often mention his Pulitzer Prize, but did so in the introduction to his new book in defense of a fellow journalist with his extremely pointed and apt statement ""Speaking in my official capacity as a Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Schneider, your movie sucks."" There is a much longer story than that behind this statement, and I highly recommend you read the book for a full account of the happenings that brought it about.As far as the movie goes, it is vile, disgusting, repulsive, and worst of all decidedly not funny: it utterly fails to live up to the standards Schneider sets in his other films.The film begins with an explanation of how Deuce's wife was eaten on their honeymoon by a shark. To prove his undying love for her, he carries one of her prosthetic legs around with him wherever he goes (until the closing credits when an old woman makes it into a bong, anyway). Deuce (Schneider) is befriended by his old friend T.J. (Eddie Griffin) who now lives in Amsterdam. T.J. is the alleged straight man (sort of) and is wrongly accused of murder. He also eats French fries and fights off an eight pound housecat in what was but the first of many revolting scenes. Deuce falls for Eva, a fellow ichthyologist, and is entranced by her sketch of a ""Sudanese Sweetlips,"" which actually is a real fish. In the meantime, we discover that Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is hilarious; this foreshadows the unpleasant case of dwarf tossing later in the film.Deuce gets to date a variety of women in his undercover occupation. I will hit the highlights by mentioning that he gets to wear diapers for a giantess; he escorts a woman who has had a laryngectomy to a fancy restaurant, and is able to provoke a fountain of red wine to shoot from the stoma in her neck (do not inquire about her case of hiccups or the subsequent use of the stoma in the plot resolution...it is so heinous, I will not discuss the matter further); finally he escorts a woman wearing a veil who explains that she is from Chernobyl, and the her mother worked in the nuclear power plant while she was pregnant. She then elaborates further that she is wearing the veil because ""instead of a nose, I was born with an appendage on my face."" Need I say more? Do not even think about her sneezing fit on the dance floor. Really. Don't think about it.The movie's alleged plot involves a killer of male prostitutes loose in Amsterdam, and the action peaks at an awards ceremony. The plot is resolved by the worst use of swordplay in screen history (and a special guest appearance by the stoma of fate.) The film then concludes with the worst ever ""where are they now"" vignettes ever committed to celluloid.The DVD has many extras, including a ""making of"" short (see how the nasal appendage was created!), a casting reel, and an extra on the making of T.J.'s ""Float Crib."" It was more bearable than the film, but only marginally so.After viewing this film (surely Schneider's very worst) I can only think that Roger Ebert was extremely generous in his appraisal. I would not recommend this film to any human being or other vertebrate of any kind.",1,"""Instead Of A Nose, I Was Born With An Appendage On My Face.""",1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,3286,"['was', 'curious', 'movie', 'one', 'reason', 'one', 'reason', 'only', 'prominent', 'position', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'new', 'wonderful', 'book', 'Movie', 'Sucks', 'Ebert', 'not', 'often', 'mention', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'did', 'so', 'introduction', 'new', 'book', 'defense', 'fellow', 'journalist', 'extremely', 'pointed', 'apt', 'statement', 'Speaking', 'official', 'capacity', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winner', 'Mr.', 'Schneider', 'movie', 'sucks', 'much', 'longer', 'story', 'statement', 'highly', 'recommend', 'read', 'book', 'full', 'account', 'happenings', 'brought', 'about.As', 'far', 'movie', 'vile', 'disgusting', 'repulsive', 'worst', 'decidedly', 'not', 'funny', 'utterly', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'Schneider', 'sets', 'other', 'films.The', 'film', 'explanation', 'how', 'Deuce', 'wife', 'was', 'eaten', 'honeymoon', 'shark', 'prove', 'undying', 'love', 'one', 'prosthetic', 'legs', 'wherever', 'closing', 'credits', 'when', 'old', 'woman', 'bong', 'anyway', 'Deuce', 'Schneider', 'befriended', 'old', 'friend', 'T.J.', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'who', 'now', 'Amsterdam', 'T.J.', 'alleged', 'straight', 'man', 'sort', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'murder', 'also', 'French', 'fries', 'fights', 'off', 'eight', 'pound', 'housecat', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'many', 'revolting', 'scenes', 'Deuce', 'Eva', 'fellow', 'ichthyologist', 'entranced', 'sketch', 'Sudanese', 'Sweetlips', 'actually', 'real', 'fish', 'meantime', 'discover', 'Obsessive-Compulsive', 'Disorder', 'OCD', 'hilarious', 'unpleasant', 'case', 'dwarf', 'tossing', 'later', 'film.Deuce', 'date', 'variety', 'women', 'undercover', 'occupation', 'will', 'hit', 'highlights', 'mentioning', 'wear', 'diapers', 'giantess', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'laryngectomy', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'able', 'provoke', 'fountain', 'red', 'wine', 'shoot', 'stoma', 'neck', 'do', 'not', 'inquire', 'case', 'hiccups', 'subsequent', 'use', 'stoma', 'plot', 'resolution', 'so', 'heinous', 'will', 'not', 'discuss', 'matter', 'further', 'finally', 'woman', 'wearing', 'veil', 'who', 'Chernobyl', 'mother', 'worked', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plant', 'was', 'pregnant', 'then', 'further', 'wearing', 'veil', 'instead', 'nose', 'was', 'born', 'appendage', 'face', 'Need', 'say', 'more', 'Do', 'not', 'even', 'think', 'sneezing', 'fit', 'dance', 'floor', 'Really', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'it.The', 'movie', 'alleged', 'plot', 'killer', 'male', 'prostitutes', 'loose', 'Amsterdam', 'action', 'peaks', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'plot', 'resolved', 'worst', 'use', 'swordplay', 'screen', 'history', 'special', 'guest', 'appearance', 'stoma', 'fate', 'film', 'then', 'worst', 'ever', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'vignettes', 'ever', 'committed', 'celluloid.The', 'DVD', 'many', 'extras', 'including', 'making', 'short', 'see', 'how', 'nasal', 'appendage', 'was', 'created', 'casting', 'reel', 'extra', 'making', 'T.J.', 'Float', 'Crib', 'was', 'more', 'bearable', 'film', 'only', 'marginally', 'so.After', 'viewing', 'film', 'surely', 'Schneider', 'very', 'worst', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'was', 'extremely', 'generous', 'appraisal', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'human', 'being', 'other', 'vertebrate', 'kind']",N/A

His former pimp, T.J., called him from Amsterdam to help the brotha solve a murder case, as a gigolo killer is on the loose.  Deuce packed his stuff and his dead girl's wooden leg and traveled to Amsterdam.  From the legalized-drug nation of Europa, he'll have to be investigate the possible suspects by being friendly with ugly clients that make the obese lady from the first film look tamed.  Also, he later has to clear T.J.'s name as being the homosexual prime suspect of the gigolo murders; no really, this movie's pulling the gay joke whenever it can.""European Gigolo"" is stupid.  Lewd, disgustingly stupid.  Everything about this movie is just wrong. The way the sequel sets-up is just rushed and it easily shafted the girl from the first movie so her wooden leg can be used as a gag and a bong piece; what a way to respect the dead.  Was a sequel really necessary? Must it really need to see a woman with a deformed phallic for a nose so she can sneeze the 'liquid' on someone's plate and have someone accidentally eat it? Did Eddie Griffin had to eat fries from a toilet? It's radically gross, and what's worse is how illogical it can be. Deuce's new love-interest in this movie said she has OCD, but her random spazes are all conditions of Tourette's syndrome; plus, she said she's afraid of doorknobs but I see a couple of scenes where she's near a doorknob and she's fine. There's a video camera that showed T.J. with a body that's already been dead, so how can he be the killer and how come it didn't footage the real murderer? What's with the joke foretelling Europeans pooping on the streets and showed a shot of a Canadian doing the exact thing?It's an amalgam of same-sex jokes, black jokes, scat humor, and inanity such as a pimpboat with hydrolics.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","It took 6 long years for our favorite he-bitch to return to the big screen, and this time, he single-handily takes on the entire male-whore population of Europe. Well, not quite. You see, the title's a misnomer; he's an American Gigolo, not European. Set in Europe you say? Only Amsterdam, where weed is legal. Doesn't even set foot in Pisa, where the poster suggests the Leaning Tower.Many critics can't wait to slam this movie, but hey, what do critics know anyway? It's a crass movie, so steer clear if you can't take crass.

Some jokes were bordering on the lame, and what made the first part interesting - the various weird girls that Deuce encounters, were very quickly glossed over. Despite the fact that the story is a little simple, generic, and weak, the movie contains non-stop jokes that will make you laugh, whether you want to or not. The movie does contain some immature humor, like the occasional fart joke; however, they are still funny. The movie also has quite a bit of creative humor. Eddie Griffin is a very funny part of the movie in a hilarious performance. This is a simple movie meant for no other purpose than to make you laugh, a purpose which it does a very good job of fulfilling. Do not treat it like a drama. It is a comedy and therefore it does not have to make perfect sense as long as it is funny.It might not have been THE comedy of that year, but it certainly has its moments.

939746,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B000BBOUCC,Joe Sherry,"[9, 24]","You don't go into theatre to see ""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo""  and expect to see a modern classic of American Film.  You go into a theatre to see the new ""Deuce Bigalow"" movie to see a dumb movie that may very well be funny.  After all, Adam Sandler's career was made on such movies, as was Jim Carrey's.  Rob Schneider, however, is neither Adam Sandler nor Jim Carrey.  So while the dumb comedy genre has the potential to deliver big laughs, this movie doesn't.  To be fair, I have seen ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" and it was surprisingly funny and far better than I expected.  It offered a fairly ridiculous premise: Rob Schneider becomes a male prostitute.  Right.  That's what I thought.  And yet because of Schneider's good nature and the absurd nature of his ""clients"", the movie worked more often than it should have.  In a place where a little went farther than it should have, Columbia Pictures decided to finance another ""Deuce Bigalow"" movie.Here is the story so far: Deuce (Schneider) is still working as a fish expert, having given up the life of a gigolo when he married his wife Kate.  Kate, unfortunately, was eaten by a shark two years ago because Deuce did not realize there was meat sauce on the lettuce he was feeding a sea turtle off of the coast of  Mexico.  Still with me?  We open the movie with Deuce getting himself into a little bit of trouble because of two kids who are serious punks and mess with his research which causes a marine accident with some elderly blind people.  When Deuce gets a phone call from his friend T.J. (Eddie Griffin) in Amsterdam, Deuce accepts the invitation to join T.J. and visit for a while.  T.J. is living large as a pimp but is down on hard times (so to speak) because there is a murderer stalking the gigolos of the city.  After stumbling upon a victim and somehow getting his friend implicated, Deuce decides to help T.J. discover who the real killer is by going back into business as a gigolo and investigating the crimes.  Honestly, that is probably more than you need to know and it is as much as I can bear to tell about the story.Like a ""Police Academy"" movie, the plot really does not matter one bit.  It is an excuse to get our hero (hero?) from one situation to another and to drive the humor along.  The real question should be: is this movie funny?  The answer: No, not really.  Much of the movie is rather stupid and parts that I think were supposed to be funny were not actually funny.

I am also not one who is easy to please with a film either. I think some people obviously took this film too seriously and if you did then it wasn't for you in the first place and you shouldn't have watched it. The Deuce films are  silly, tasteless, vulgar and juvenile in spots but they are SUPPOSED to be! No one claimed these films to be the uptime of upstanding comedy! Sometimes comedy can simply be entertaining on it's own level.I think that too many people are thinking that the Deuce films should be on the level of other standard comedies. Well they aren't and you gotta respect the films for what they are. For the naysayers who took this film too seriously, when you saw that Rob Schneider and Eddie Griffin were the stars what in the world did you EXPECT? An oscar-winning comedy? Please! You shouldn't be surprised at what you got. Both of these men are known for making bad, semi-funny films. But that's what makes them stars! They got famous off of being silly!Some folks need to relax and get off their high horse. If you expected more from these two then you need help or a life. Rob and Eddie are the kings of silly comedies so expecting anything other than that would be a disservice to yourself.I found this sequel even funnier than the first one. I admit that the first had more of a background and even though it was silly, it could be taken a little more seriously than European Giggilo but NEWSFLASH, these films aren't supposed to be taken seriously! Just watch them and be entertained and you'll enjoy them.If you're looking for an Amy Heckerling-clever-like comedy,then this is not for you! If you just want a to watch a film with some laughs where you can rest from thinking and just chill to get away from all the BS in the world today, then Deuce is a decent enough film for that.

And was released in 2005, so why after 6 years, did they bring a sequel out, usually sequels may come out within 2 years of the first movie. And even through both movies have Gigolo in the title, he is being called a man-whore. So then why don't they have man-whore in the title, maybe because it is better to have Gigolo in the title, then man-whore. And by looking at the cast list, it looked like that Rob Schneider and Eddie Griffin are the only ones from the first movie that is back in this sequel, but Oded Fehr who played Antoine Laconte who was the Gigolo, that hired Deuce to stay in house while he went to Switzerland for 3 weeks, to care for his sick fish, but while doing that he destryos the Gigolo's house, and has to earn money for repiars, so he becomes a man-whore/gigolo himself in case you have forgotten, he appears in this movie in an uncredited role, so please don't be looking for his name in the credits, cause you not going to find it. When we last saw Deuce Bigalow (Rob Schneider) he left the business, and married Kate, the gril he met while doing the business, and was the only one he feel in love with, but on thier honeymoon, she was eaten by a shark, and Deuce is left a widower. And to this day, the only thing he has left of her is her fake leg. So the movie picks up where we meet him at a beach, and then he gets blamed for accident, so he returns home, and recives a long distance phone call from T.J. (Eddie Griffin) who is now in  Amsterdam. And he ask him to vist him, Deuce filps on the TV, and see the story, and a sketch picture of him, and deicdes that far away is best. But he arrives at a pretty bad time, since there is a serial killer on the loose. And now TJ is being framed for it, but Deuce is the only one that knows he is innconet, and even the cop Gaspar Voorsboch (Jeroen Krabbe), doesn't believe him. And along the way, he meets his niece Eva (Hanna Verboom), and she suffers from OCD. So once again, Deuce has to become a man-whore/gigolo, to be able to capture the real killer. His first date makes him dress up like a baby.
