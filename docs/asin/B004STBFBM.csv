1427510,A33DP67IAGRTZR,B004STBFBM,Christopher Carter,"[0, 0]",This completes the tenchi ova series and ties it into the gxp series. Despite what others have said I believe this is a good ending. Yes there are a couple a voices that have change but it doesn't deviate from the story line and the actors play the part to how the story line evolved in the first two. The only problem I have is with the way the product was shipped the secound disc was loose  bouncing around in case leaving scratches on disc.,5,Must have for tenchi fans.,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,444,"['tenchi', 'ova', 'series', 'gxp', 'series', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'believe', 'good', 'ending', 'are', 'couple', 'voices', 'have', 'change', ""n't"", 'deviate', 'story', 'line', 'actors', 'play', 'part', 'how', 'story', 'line', 'evolved', 'first', 'two', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'way', 'product', 'was', 'shipped', 'secound', 'disc', 'was', 'loose', 'bouncing', 'around', 'case', 'leaving', 'scratches', 'disc']",N/A
1427511,A2JBKT35YK1X0V,B004STBFBM,"HenBond ""HenBond""","[3, 3]","I enjoyed Tenchi Muyo first and second OVA series in the mid 90 which it ended on the cliffhanger until almost 10 years later Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki released as the third OVA series picked up where the second OVA ended. I was glad it gets third OVA series at first but after I watched the few episodes from Ryo Ohki, I was very disappointment for more than one reason. The character design is slightly worsen than previous OVA, I am not too picky about English dub but this one the dub is awful, the complete third OVA is not funny nor interesting, and previous OVA have a handful of interesting soundtracks (J-Pop) that was nicely translated into English version which you won't find any on this one. Overall I feel this third OVA lost most of the charms that I like about first OVA, second OVA, and Tenchi Universe.",1,Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki is big disappointment in more than one way.,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,815,"['enjoyed', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'first', 'second', 'OVA', 'series', 'mid', '90', 'ended', 'cliffhanger', 'almost', '10', 'years', 'later', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Ryo', 'Ohki', 'released', 'third', 'OVA', 'series', 'picked', 'where', 'second', 'OVA', 'ended', 'was', 'glad', 'third', 'OVA', 'series', 'first', 'watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'Ryo', 'Ohki', 'was', 'very', 'disappointment', 'more', 'one', 'reason', 'character', 'design', 'slightly', 'worsen', 'previous', 'OVA', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'picky', 'English', 'dub', 'one', 'dub', 'awful', 'complete', 'third', 'OVA', 'not', 'funny', 'interesting', 'previous', 'OVA', 'have', 'handful', 'interesting', 'soundtracks', 'J-Pop', 'was', 'nicely', 'translated', 'English', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', 'Overall', 'feel', 'third', 'OVA', 'lost', 'most', 'charms', 'like', 'first', 'OVA', 'second', 'OVA', 'Tenchi', 'Universe']",N/A

1427513,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B004STBFBM,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[7, 8]",This is the conclusion to the legendary original Tenchi Muyo series. Telling you about the story would spoil the fun for old Tenchi fans that haven't seen it. I'll just say that it takes a major plot twist in any Tenchi series to surprise me b/c it's all been done. That was what I thought before I saw this. It's got some major surprises in store. It's great. The only complaint I have is the different voice actor for Ryoko. Other than that this is a great conclusion to the original Tenchi series. Definitely give it a go.,4,Conclusion to the origional Tenchi Muyo,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,525,"['conclusion', 'legendary', 'original', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'series', 'Telling', 'story', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'old', 'Tenchi', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'major', 'plot', 'twist', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'surprise', 'been', 'done', 'was', 'what', 'thought', 'saw', 'got', 'major', 'surprises', 'store', 'great', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'different', 'voice', 'actor', 'Ryoko', 'Other', 'great', 'conclusion', 'original', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'Definitely', 'give', 'go']",N/A

1427515,AGQF1EMUZC3VB,B004STBFBM,Peyton C. Presgrove,"[1, 1]","Tenchi Muyo has always been one of my favorite anime franchises, but the Third OVA is a HORRIBLE way to wrap-up this particular piece of Tenchi Cannon, not only does it not make sense unless you read the Tenchi novels which were written in the decade long wait between the end of the original OVA's and the creation of this one.  But OVA 3 in and of its self has horrible pacing! And the last episode is downright confusing and nonsensical!  *well again it'll make sense if you had read the Japanese novels, but sadly those were never translated and brought stateside*So overall this whole thing is a MESS, I understand why its a mess, there was a big delay, it was made by a different studio then the original's, etc.  But still its disheartening to see the heart of the Tenchi-franchise wrapped up in such a SLOPPY manner.  If you ask me your much better off sticking with the original OVA's, Universe, and the films as opposed to this.  Heck even Tenchi In Tokyo is MUCH MUCH better then this mangled-up mashed-up  slapped together monstrosity!I will say this though, in OVA 3's defense,  it has nice music, and it does (in a round about way) do a good job of setting up for GXP, and it was nice for Funimation to get as many of the original VA's back as they could (although sad Ryoko's va didn't return.But yeah, overall unless your just a huge Tenchi fan (such as myself) or a comlpetist, stay away from this thing!
