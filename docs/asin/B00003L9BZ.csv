545296,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00003L9BZ,trebe,"[0, 0]","Charlie The Lonesome Cougar (1967) is an adventure tale that features a real cougar as its star.  Using real animals, it's the kind of movie that was a Disney specialty, and along with TV programs like Lassie, Gentle Ben, Flipper, and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom, was the kind of entertainment that a generation of kids in the 60's grew up with.The story is very simple, as a forester named Jess Bradley (Ron Brown), discovers a young cougar cub in the woods in Montana, and takes him home.  The male cub is named Charlie, and grows up becoming used to being around people, and other animals like dogs.  Jess works for the Carbon County Lumber Company, and Charlie routinely accompanies him to work.  The young cougar has some exciting adventures at a logging camp, taking a wild ride down a river, and later gets into mischief at a lumber mill.  Charlie eventually gets loose, and learns how to survive in the wild, having further adventures with other animals, and one startled farmer.  Eventually Charlie makes his way back to the lumber mill, panicking the workers.  The cougar is on the verge of being shot, when he recognizes his old friend Jess, and is briefly taken back into captivity, before being released in a protected wildlife refuge, to happily live the rest of his days in the Big Sky country.The kind of warm feel-good adventure that Disney was known for, Charlie the Lonesome Cougar features a truly remarkable performance by the cougars playing Charlie.  The animals are obviously very well trained, as the cougars perform a myriad of tasks and actions, and also some astounding tricks and stunts.  The cougar's interaction with both his human and animal co-stars is at times astonishing.  There are so many shots where it is obvious that there are no animal handlers anywhere nearby.  The cougar does all kinds of things involving logs, walking on moving logs in a river, riding on them in a sluice, pushing them in a log jam, and even jumping on one to challenge a man in a log rolling contest!  Much of this footage appears to feature a real animal, and if so, is quite impressive.  Charlie also has some terrific interactive scenes with other animals, including `Chainsaw' a fox terrier, other dogs, a bear cub, some cats, a cow, a hog, some sheep, deer, and another cougar, as well as a confrontation with a very feisty raccoon.In modern times, when animated animal characters can do such amazing things, it might be easy to take for granted Charlie's real life exploits.  If you keep in mind that this is a live animal, and one that is by its nature a hunter and killer, you might appreciate what a really remarkable achievement this performance is.  Check out those teeth when Charlie snarls!  Watching the cougar in the wild, running and leaping, and you get a real appreciation for the grace, balance, and immense power the animal possesses.The film does take a dated and traditionally folksy Disney approach to storytelling, using the iconic Rex Allen to narrate the tale.  It's pretty corny, but this was a popular style back then, and the narration along with the lively musical score, really does help to make the story flow along.  The acting by the humans is often stiff and pretty goofy, but the people are mostly used as setups for the Cougar and other critters.  Give Ron Brown and the rest cast credit for bravery, as many work side by side with the big cat.  This is a classic example of Disney's work in this genre, and a particularly impressive one, as featuring a performing cougar was probably a bit more challenging than working with an animal like a dog.  With a pretty good story, and lots of great action scenes with animals, Charlie the Lonesome Cougar is highly recommended family entertainment.",5,"Charlie the Lonesome Cougar, a classic Disney live animal adventure...",1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,3747,"['Charlie', 'Lonesome', 'Cougar', '1967', 'adventure', 'tale', 'real', 'cougar', 'star', 'Using', 'real', 'animals', 'kind', 'movie', 'was', 'Disney', 'specialty', 'TV', 'programs', 'Lassie', 'Gentle', 'Ben', 'Flipper', 'Mutual', 'Omaha', 'Wild', 'Kingdom', 'was', 'kind', 'entertainment', 'generation', 'kids', '60', 'grew', 'up', 'with.The', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'forester', 'named', 'Jess', 'Bradley', 'Ron', 'Brown', 'young', 'cougar', 'cub', 'woods', 'Montana', 'home', 'male', 'cub', 'named', 'Charlie', 'up', 'becoming', 'used', 'being', 'people', 'other', 'animals', 'dogs', 'Jess', 'Carbon', 'County', 'Lumber', 'Company', 'Charlie', 'routinely', 'work', 'young', 'cougar', 'exciting', 'adventures', 'logging', 'camp', 'taking', 'wild', 'ride', 'river', 'later', 'mischief', 'lumber', 'mill', 'Charlie', 'eventually', 'loose', 'how', 'survive', 'wild', 'having', 'further', 'adventures', 'other', 'animals', 'one', 'startled', 'farmer', 'Eventually', 'Charlie', 'way', 'back', 'lumber', 'mill', 'panicking', 'workers', 'cougar', 'verge', 'being', 'shot', 'when', 'old', 'friend', 'Jess', 'briefly', 'taken', 'back', 'captivity', 'being', 'released', 'protected', 'wildlife', 'refuge', 'happily', 'live', 'rest', 'days', 'Big', 'Sky', 'country.The', 'kind', 'warm', 'feel-good', 'adventure', 'Disney', 'was', 'known', 'Charlie', 'Lonesome', 'Cougar', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'cougars', 'playing', 'Charlie', 'animals', 'are', 'obviously', 'very', 'well', 'trained', 'cougars', 'perform', 'myriad', 'tasks', 'actions', 'also', 'astounding', 'tricks', 'stunts', 'cougar', 'interaction', 'human', 'animal', 'co-stars', 'times', 'astonishing', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'shots', 'where', 'obvious', 'are', 'animal', 'handlers', 'anywhere', 'nearby', 'cougar', 'kinds', 'things', 'involving', 'logs', 'walking', 'moving', 'logs', 'river', 'riding', 'sluice', 'pushing', 'log', 'jam', 'even', 'jumping', 'one', 'challenge', 'man', 'log', 'rolling', 'contest', 'Much', 'footage', 'feature', 'real', 'animal', 'so', 'quite', 'impressive', 'Charlie', 'also', 'terrific', 'interactive', 'scenes', 'other', 'animals', 'including', 'Chainsaw', 'fox', 'terrier', 'other', 'dogs', 'bear', 'cub', 'cats', 'cow', 'hog', 'sheep', 'deer', 'cougar', 'as', 'well', 'confrontation', 'very', 'feisty', 'raccoon.In', 'modern', 'times', 'when', 'animated', 'animal', 'characters', 'can', 'do', 'such', 'amazing', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'easy', 'take', 'granted', 'Charlie', 'real', 'life', 'exploits', 'keep', 'mind', 'live', 'animal', 'one', 'nature', 'hunter', 'killer', 'might', 'appreciate', 'what', 'really', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'performance', 'Check', 'out', 'teeth', 'when', 'Charlie', 'snarls', 'Watching', 'cougar', 'wild', 'running', 'leaping', 'get', 'real', 'appreciation', 'grace', 'balance', 'immense', 'power', 'animal', 'possesses.The', 'film', 'take', 'dated', 'traditionally', 'folksy', 'Disney', 'approach', 'storytelling', 'using', 'iconic', 'Rex', 'Allen', 'narrate', 'tale', 'pretty', 'corny', 'was', 'popular', 'style', 'back', 'then', 'narration', 'lively', 'musical', 'score', 'really', 'help', 'make', 'story', 'flow', 'along', 'acting', 'humans', 'often', 'stiff', 'pretty', 'goofy', 'people', 'are', 'mostly', 'used', 'setups', 'Cougar', 'other', 'critters', 'Give', 'Ron', 'Brown', 'rest', 'cast', 'credit', 'bravery', 'many', 'work', 'side', 'side', 'big', 'cat', 'classic', 'example', 'Disney', 'work', 'genre', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'one', 'featuring', 'performing', 'cougar', 'was', 'probably', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'working', 'animal', 'dog', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'lots', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'animals', 'Charlie', 'Lonesome', 'Cougar', 'highly', 'recommended', 'family', 'entertainment']",N/A
