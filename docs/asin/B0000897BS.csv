Cillian's bizarre hyper-exaggerated ""Cork"" accent made me want to reach into the screen and smack him at (many) points. This one aspect of the film alone ruins it for me. Perhaps the accent was chosen to make him seem more insane, but honestly, it made him seem more of a brutal dullard than anything else, which makes one wonder why Runt would have ever cared for his company in the first place.All in all, an interesting, but aggravating film to watch.",2,A perfectly painful film for your ears,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,606,"['agree', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'film', 'well-directed', 'shot', 'engrossing', 'plot', 'also', 'chock-full', 'weirdness', 'Cillian', 'bizarre', 'hyper-exaggerated', 'Cork', 'accent', 'made', 'want', 'reach', 'screen', 'smack', 'many', 'points', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'alone', 'Perhaps', 'accent', 'was', 'chosen', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'insane', 'honestly', 'made', 'seem', 'more', 'brutal', 'dullard', 'anything', 'else', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'Runt', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'cared', 'company', 'first', 'place.All', 'interesting', 'aggravating', 'film', 'watch']",Disco Pigs

They love each other to the exclusion of all the rest of creation. This seems idyllic, and it is, at least for a while. Pig and Runt are childlike teens approaching adulthood, at least physically. Mentally, they are both what they have always been, two children lost in each other. Then, one day Pig sees Runt in a new and different way. He sees her as a woman. Suddenly, she's not just the girl he's grown up with, but a beautiful, desirable woman. From here the relationship begins to change. Two types of love emerge. Pig is ill-equipped to deal w/ the emotions that overwhelm him. This is where the relationship leaves its crazy innocence behind, and becomes increasingly dangerous, even deadly. DISCO PIGS is a tragic love story in a similar vein to HEAVENLY CREATURES. Both films concern an all-consuming love that blots out all else.

736365,A1W5J6ATHGRS71,B0000897BS,"C. Miller ""Knitter and bookworm""","[24, 28]","&quot;Disco Pigs&quot; is the story of two Irish teenagers, Pig (Cillian Murphy) and Runt (Elaine Cassidy), who have been inseparable since birth.  Born moments apart, they live next door to one another in Cork, speak their own language, live by their own rules, and generally do their best to ignore everyone else around them.  So far, they have managed to keep the outside world from creeping into their sur-reality, in which they imagine searching for a palace where they will be king and queen someday.But the real world closes in and threatens this when Runt is sent away to a vocational school, and Pig realizes his world is nothing without her.  He tries to win Runt back and is lost when it seems Runt may not feel as strongly as he does.Cillian Murphy is nothing short of extraordinary as Pig, teetering on the line between sanity and madness as he struggles to hold on to the world he and Runt have created, just as he tries to convince her to do the same.  Murphy clearly knows the character well, having originated the role in its successful theatrical run, and it shows.  The character practically jumps off the screen, he is so alive and present in each moment.Elaine Cassidy seems less comfortable in the role of Runt.  She is a highly evocative actor, capable of registering a spectrum of emotions in a single glance, but her performance here is opaque and unfocused at times.  Murphy may get the fireworks as the volatile Pig, but Cassidy never registers Runt's emotional center.This is director Kirsten Sheridan's first full-length film, and while it bodes well for her future, &quot;Disco Pigs&quot; is far from a perfect film, lagging at times and indulging itself in others.  It is a fascinating character study in which a world of contrasts is created.  The frenetic action of the Cork discos pitted against the calmness of the sea show how different Pig and Runt have become and how divergent their futures may be.  But Sheridan almost tries to put too much symbolism and too many allusions in the film and doesn't give herself enough time to flesh those out, making the film seem muddled and rushed in places.All in all, though, &quot;Disco Pigs&quot; is an original, though-provoking film.",4,"Original and refreshing, if flawed",1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,2214,"['quot', 'Disco', 'Pigs', 'quot', 'story', 'two', 'Irish', 'teenagers', 'Pig', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Runt', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'inseparable', 'birth', 'Born', 'moments', 'apart', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'one', 'Cork', 'speak', 'own', 'language', 'live', 'own', 'rules', 'generally', 'do', 'best', 'ignore', 'everyone', 'else', 'So', 'far', 'have', 'managed', 'keep', 'outside', 'world', 'creeping', 'sur-reality', 'imagine', 'searching', 'palace', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'king', 'queen', 'someday.But', 'real', 'world', 'when', 'Runt', 'sent', 'away', 'vocational', 'school', 'Pig', 'world', 'nothing', 'win', 'Runt', 'back', 'lost', 'when', 'Runt', 'may', 'not', 'feel', 'as', 'strongly', 'does.Cillian', 'Murphy', 'nothing', 'short', 'extraordinary', 'Pig', 'teetering', 'line', 'sanity', 'madness', 'hold', 'world', 'Runt', 'have', 'created', 'just', 'convince', 'do', 'same', 'Murphy', 'clearly', 'character', 'well', 'having', 'originated', 'role', 'successful', 'theatrical', 'run', 'character', 'practically', 'screen', 'so', 'alive', 'present', 'moment.Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'less', 'comfortable', 'role', 'Runt', 'highly', 'evocative', 'actor', 'capable', 'registering', 'spectrum', 'emotions', 'single', 'glance', 'performance', 'here', 'opaque', 'unfocused', 'times', 'Murphy', 'may', 'get', 'fireworks', 'volatile', 'Pig', 'Cassidy', 'never', 'Runt', 'emotional', 'center.This', 'director', 'Kirsten', 'Sheridan', 'first', 'full-length', 'film', 'well', 'future', 'quot', 'Disco', 'Pigs', 'quot', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'lagging', 'times', 'indulging', 'others', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'world', 'contrasts', 'created', 'frenetic', 'action', 'Cork', 'discos', 'pitted', 'calmness', 'sea', 'show', 'how', 'different', 'Pig', 'Runt', 'have', 'become', 'how', 'divergent', 'futures', 'may', 'be', 'Sheridan', 'almost', 'put', 'too', 'much', 'symbolism', 'too', 'many', 'allusions', 'film', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'time', 'flesh', 'making', 'film', 'seem', 'muddled', 'rushed', 'places.All', 'quot', 'Disco', 'Pigs', 'quot', 'original', 'though-provoking', 'film']",Disco Pigs

736368,A1KELU76GK578O,B0000897BS,"Kim M. Brantley ""BTheFuture""","[3, 5]","I saw Disco Pigs on the heels of watching Cillian Murphy in Red Eye.  What a triumph for director Sheridan. What stood out for me was the similarities between Pig's experience as an Irish youth and that of many young African-American males. Pig appeared to be reared in a single-parent environment where there was no father figure; his school social worker made reference to him as a ""lost cause"" and his identification with manhood was sought through having his first sexual experience with his girl, Runt.  Despite the dense dialogue, I was amazed to see that the two were actually robbing a liquor store at one point.  I could almost feel the downward spiral beginning as Pig slowly but surely lost his anchor with reality.  The sense of fear and doom I felt for these two teens mirrored the fear I felt for the teens in Boyz N' The Hood. The ending to Disco Pigs is an absolute shocker.  Few movies have moved me to that extent.  I was literally haunted for many months afterwards -- largely due to the outstanding performances by Murphy and Cassidy. Sheridan's expertise in directing successfully captures the innocence of youthful, unbridled puppy love, while simultaneously illustrating the affect of the erosion of confidence and dignity and the stark emasculation young males experience, often times at the hands of their own countrymen.",5,Haunting Similarities Regarding Teen Angst.,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,1346,"['saw', 'Disco', 'Pigs', 'heels', 'watching', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Red', 'Eye', 'What', 'triumph', 'director', 'Sheridan', 'What', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'similarities', 'Pig', 'experience', 'Irish', 'youth', 'many', 'young', 'African-American', 'males', 'Pig', 'appeared', 'be', 'reared', 'single-parent', 'environment', 'where', 'was', 'father', 'figure', 'school', 'social', 'worker', 'made', 'reference', 'lost', 'cause', 'identification', 'manhood', 'was', 'sought', 'having', 'first', 'sexual', 'experience', 'girl', 'Runt', 'dense', 'dialogue', 'was', 'amazed', 'see', 'two', 'were', 'actually', 'robbing', 'liquor', 'store', 'one', 'point', 'could', 'almost', 'feel', 'downward', 'spiral', 'beginning', 'Pig', 'slowly', 'surely', 'lost', 'anchor', 'reality', 'sense', 'fear', 'doom', 'felt', 'two', 'teens', 'mirrored', 'fear', 'felt', 'teens', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'ending', 'Disco', 'Pigs', 'absolute', 'shocker', 'Few', 'movies', 'have', 'moved', 'extent', 'was', 'literally', 'haunted', 'many', 'months', 'afterwards', 'largely', 'due', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Murphy', 'Cassidy', 'Sheridan', 'expertise', 'directing', 'successfully', 'innocence', 'youthful', 'unbridled', 'puppy', 'love', 'simultaneously', 'illustrating', 'affect', 'erosion', 'confidence', 'dignity', 'stark', 'emasculation', 'young', 'males', 'experience', 'often', 'hands', 'own', 'countrymen']",Disco Pigs
