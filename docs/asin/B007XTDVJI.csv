1539748,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B007XTDVJI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","In the same year that Eleanor Parker starred in the edgyDetective Story (1951)(and was later nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for it), she ventured into romantic comedy territory with A MILLIONAIRE FOR CHRISTY. She built her reputation on the strength of her fine dramatic turns, and yet I vastly prefer her more playful vehicles. I guess I don't fancy me the three-hankie tearjerker. My favorite Eleanor Parker movie isThe Voice of the Turtle(a.k.a. ONE FOR THE BOOK), a fine and gentle wartime romantic comedy. This one's a bit more in your face with the humor. It's got more screwball elements. It's produced by Parker's then husband, Bert Friedlob, and directed by George Marshall whose resume includes another slapstick MacMurray picture,Murder, He Says.Christabel Sloane (Parker) is a legal secretary for a San Francisco law firm. She's struggling to make ends meet. Behind on her debts, she sees her mink coat repossessed, the one nice thing she owns. Her boss tasks her with flying out to Los Angeles to inform a man of his uncle's passing and of his subsequent inheritance of 28 million pesos (or two million dollars). Christabel (or ""Christy"") is inherently a good girl, except that her pragmatic co-worker (Una Merkel) begins to fill her head with cynical thoughts. She's advised to catch herself a millionaire and to ""Throw your personality at him."" The co-worker says on: ""For one day be a scarlet woman. The rest of your life you can be virtuous.""In Los Angeles Christy doesn't waste time setting her cap on Peter Ulysses Lockwood (Fred MacMurray), a.k.a. ""the Sunshine Man."" Lockwood is a radio philosopher whose on-air shtick is as tiresome as his constant promotion of his talk show sponsor's prune product (yum). Parker demonstrates her gift for deft physical comedy as she finds occasion to bat her eyelashes and repeatedly swoon in MacMurray's arms. Trust me, she executes this much better than I'm describing it. Christy's conscience rapidly kicks in and, minutes into her vamping, she does fess up on Peter's inheritance. Except that, by this time, she's got him convinced that she's cuckooville.And maybe I should've mentioned that today is Peter's wedding day to a high profile society heiress (Kay Buckley). Christy picked a fine time to play homewrecker. In the course of things, Christy is accused of being the other woman which then stalls the wedding. In her efforts to make amends, Christy triggers a chain of comic misunderstandings and misadventures. It all culminates in a raucous sequence that gathers in thankful orphans, a Salvation Army band, newshounds, the police, and that bunch of boisterous, tequila-drinking Mexicans that Christy and Peter had met earlier on their road trip. Oh, yeah, Christy and Peter embark on a road trip, thanks to Peter's psychiatrist pal (Richard Carlson) who's not so secretly in love with Peter's fianc&eacute;e and would prefer that the wedding doesn't happen at all. He makes Peter take the two-hour drive to his office so that he could properly psychoanalyze Christy. See, Peter's claim to innocence depends on his ""She's nuts!"" defense.I enjoyed this droll comedy, mostly because of Eleanor Parker who proves again that she can lighten the mood with the best of them. Eleanor's part calls for her to entertain stealing MacMurray away from his fianc&eacute;e, but she's so dang endearing I can't find it in me to judge her objectively. If anyone, it's the old pro Fred MacMurray whom I'm harder on for his flirtation with a heel turn. Thankfully, it doesn't come close to being as grimy as his role inThe Apartment (Collector's Edition)(in which he was never more beady-eyed). Still, I liked MacMurray's expert mugging and the comedic timing between him and Parker, if not the chemistry. It's something of a throwback film in that it recalls the daffiness of those screwballs from the 1930s. And I still cringe when I think of what happens to those two million dollars. And if you ask me, that psychiatrist pal is kind of a fink.3.5 out of 5 stars.",4,Eleanor Parker's likable gold digger,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,4022,"['same', 'year', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'starred', 'edgyDetective', 'Story', '1951', 'was', 'later', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'ventured', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'territory', 'A', 'MILLIONAIRE', 'FOR', 'CHRISTY', 'built', 'reputation', 'strength', 'fine', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'yet', 'vastly', 'prefer', 'more', 'playful', 'vehicles', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'fancy', 'three-hankie', 'tearjerker', 'favorite', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'movie', 'isThe', 'Voice', 'Turtle', 'a.k.a', 'ONE', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'fine', 'gentle', 'wartime', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'one', 'bit', 'more', 'face', 'humor', 'got', 'more', 'screwball', 'elements', 'produced', 'Parker', 'then', 'husband', 'Bert', 'Friedlob', 'directed', 'George', 'Marshall', 'resume', 'slapstick', 'MacMurray', 'picture', 'Murder', 'Says.Christabel', 'Sloane', 'Parker', 'legal', 'secretary', 'San', 'Francisco', 'law', 'firm', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'debts', 'mink', 'coat', 'repossessed', 'one', 'nice', 'thing', 'boss', 'flying', 'out', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'inform', 'man', 'uncle', 'passing', 'subsequent', 'inheritance', '28', 'million', 'pesos', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'Christabel', 'Christy', 'inherently', 'good', 'girl', 'pragmatic', 'co-worker', 'Una', 'Merkel', 'fill', 'head', 'cynical', 'thoughts', 'advised', 'catch', 'millionaire', 'Throw', 'personality', 'co-worker', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'scarlet', 'woman', 'rest', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'virtuous', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Christy', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'setting', 'cap', 'Peter', 'Ulysses', 'Lockwood', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'a.k.a', 'Sunshine', 'Man', 'Lockwood', 'radio', 'philosopher', 'on-air', 'shtick', 'as', 'tiresome', 'constant', 'promotion', 'talk', 'show', 'sponsor', 'prune', 'product', 'yum', 'Parker', 'gift', 'deft', 'physical', 'comedy', 'occasion', 'bat', 'eyelashes', 'repeatedly', 'swoon', 'MacMurray', 'arms', 'Trust', 'much', 'better', ""'m"", 'describing', 'Christy', 'conscience', 'rapidly', 'minutes', 'vamping', 'fess', 'up', 'Peter', 'inheritance', 'time', 'got', 'convinced', 'cuckooville.And', 'maybe', 'should', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'today', 'Peter', 'wedding', 'day', 'high', 'profile', 'society', 'heiress', 'Kay', 'Buckley', 'Christy', 'picked', 'fine', 'time', 'play', 'homewrecker', 'course', 'things', 'Christy', 'accused', 'being', 'other', 'woman', 'then', 'wedding', 'efforts', 'make', 'amends', 'Christy', 'chain', 'comic', 'misunderstandings', 'misadventures', 'culminates', 'raucous', 'sequence', 'gathers', 'thankful', 'orphans', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'band', 'newshounds', 'police', 'bunch', 'boisterous', 'tequila-drinking', 'Mexicans', 'Christy', 'Peter', 'had', 'met', 'earlier', 'road', 'trip', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Christy', 'Peter', 'embark', 'road', 'trip', 'thanks', 'Peter', 'psychiatrist', 'pal', 'Richard', 'Carlson', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'secretly', 'love', 'Peter', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'e', 'would', 'prefer', 'wedding', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Peter', 'take', 'two-hour', 'drive', 'office', 'so', 'could', 'properly', 'psychoanalyze', 'Christy', 'See', 'Peter', 'claim', 'innocence', 'depends', 'nuts', 'enjoyed', 'droll', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'who', 'again', 'can', 'lighten', 'mood', 'best', 'Eleanor', 'part', 'entertain', 'stealing', 'MacMurray', 'away', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'so', 'dang', 'endearing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'judge', 'objectively', 'anyone', 'old', 'pro', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'whom', ""'m"", 'harder', 'flirtation', 'heel', 'turn', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'being', 'as', 'grimy', 'role', 'inThe', 'Apartment', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'beady-eyed', 'Still', 'liked', 'MacMurray', 'expert', 'mugging', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Parker', 'not', 'chemistry', 'something', 'throwback', 'film', 'daffiness', 'screwballs', '1930s', 'still', 'cringe', 'when', 'think', 'what', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'ask', 'psychiatrist', 'pal', 'kind', 'fink.3.5', '5', 'stars']",N/A
