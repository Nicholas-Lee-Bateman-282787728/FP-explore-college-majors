1290579,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B002USF1TU,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","As the other reviews indicate, this is generally a very fast paced horror film having a lot more in common with summer blockbusters (think Transformers) than a traditional horror film. Like transformers, the viewer is presented with a plot having a bunch of sequential details that just happen without any underlying logical cause-effect connection. In this case, those non-sequittur leaps happen, somewhat blatantly, but the action is quick enough that the viewer doesn't have time to really think it through. However, if you're able to accelerate your on-the-fly cognition, you may, as I have, found these leaps annoyingly thin. For reasons I can't well articulate, sometimes those leaps are ok, and not a movie killer (probably has something to do with another redeeming quality that makes up for this problem), but I'm having a hard time accepting those failures in this movie. Again, though, if you're in the mood for a sit back, eat popcorn and not think much-type of movie (which I very often am), you might enjoy this film.  The production values are high, the crazy Nazi is played by the Inglorious Basters stuffy brit spy guy, and it is fast.

Let me first say, there are two loose ends that just nagged the heck out of me through the movie.  First, supposedly these people kept Victor for *two years.*  Yet we never see any indication of where and how they actually kept him.  If they'd kept him in the trailer, he'd be dead of exposure and probably gangrene. In *any* event, he should've been pale and wasted and weak.  The other loose end is why in the world would Wirth have brought bones of his family with him to America, where they would later become his only vulnerability?  That seemed discordant and was never explained.Aside from those two points that really bugged me, by and large the film kept my interest tightly enough to let me overlook any further logic gaps.  The movie progressed at a quick pace, the acting was actually really great.  Even the minor actors fit well into their characters and gave convincing performances.  The special effects were convincing.  The zombie horse was particularly effective and creepy and not nearly as humorous or schlocky as it sounds.One thing this movie loses by releasing direct to DVD is that you really need to watch this movie in a dark room.  The film lighting and shading make it much more effective if watched in the dark.  Very simple thing, but amazingly true.  Try it.  It adds a whole 'nother level of atmosphere.I saw this movie on Netflix and liked it so much that I came straight to Amazon to buy.  This is an interesting, well-done movie that manages some originality and interesting twists.  It's not going to win any Oscars, but then again, I don't generally watch Oscar award-winning films for entertainment.  This is interesting, creepy and entertaining, and if that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.",4,Another pleasantly surprised viewer,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,1834,"[""'m"", 'yet', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', ""n't"", 'as', 'cheesy', 'expected', 'Let', 'first', 'say', 'are', 'two', 'loose', 'ends', 'just', 'nagged', 'heck', 'movie', 'First', 'supposedly', 'people', 'kept', 'Victor', '*two', 'years', '*', 'never', 'see', 'indication', 'where', 'how', 'actually', 'kept', ""'d"", 'kept', 'trailer', ""'d"", 'be', 'dead', 'exposure', 'probably', 'gangrene', '*any*', 'event', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pale', 'wasted', 'weak', 'other', 'loose', 'end', 'why', 'world', 'would', 'Wirth', 'have', 'brought', 'bones', 'family', 'America', 'where', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'only', 'vulnerability', 'seemed', 'discordant', 'was', 'never', 'explained.Aside', 'two', 'points', 'really', 'bugged', 'large', 'film', 'kept', 'interest', 'tightly', 'enough', 'let', 'overlook', 'further', 'logic', 'gaps', 'movie', 'progressed', 'quick', 'pace', 'acting', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'great', 'Even', 'minor', 'actors', 'fit', 'well', 'characters', 'gave', 'convincing', 'performances', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'convincing', 'zombie', 'horse', 'was', 'particularly', 'effective', 'creepy', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'humorous', 'schlocky', 'thing', 'movie', 'releasing', 'direct', 'DVD', 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'dark', 'room', 'film', 'lighting', 'shading', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'watched', 'dark', 'Very', 'simple', 'thing', 'amazingly', 'true', 'Try', 'whole', 'level', 'atmosphere.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'Netflix', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'came', 'straight', 'Amazon', 'buy', 'interesting', 'well-done', 'movie', 'originality', 'interesting', 'twists', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'Oscars', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'watch', 'Oscar', 'award-winning', 'films', 'entertainment', 'interesting', 'creepy', 'entertaining', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Blood Creek

1290584,A2AQG4XS7MJUB4,B002USF1TU,Daniel S. Cooter,"[0, 0]","If possible, I would have given this one a 3 1/2.  I think it is better than three, but not sure of 4 stars.  The acting is good, and the premise is pretty good, but there are some holes in the story line, some of the special effects leave much to be desired, and I think the genre will have a limited appeal.As I said, the storyline is pretty good (for the Nazi-occult genre) - Nazi official visits an immigrant German farm family in Virginia in the 1930s, where his sinister occult intentions become known.  Without giving too much away, the end result is that the family of four is then held prisoner on their farm and in time (they stop aging) while forced to serve the Nazi monster.  In serving him, over the years they've trapped unsuspecting campers and fishermen for use by the monster.  This is one of the holes in the plot - as pointed out by another reviewer, no one has investigated this farm in the area where all these people have disappeared throughout the years?  Another story hole - no neighbors or anyone the family does business with has noticed this family hasn't aged in 60 years?!  They've lived on the same farm, drive a truck (needing gas) and sell their produce locally, but no one has noticed them?  One of the victims is a character played by Dominic Purcell - he escapes and enlists his younger brother (Henry Cavill) to go back to the farm and stop the horror.  In the process the full story is revealed, battle ensues, etc., etc., etc....Overall, I thought the acting was good.  Cavill pulls off a decent generic American accent.  There are no superfluous scenes (even the early scenes of Cavill, and between Cavill and Purcell, explains their back story).  Some of the decisions by some of the characters seem far-fetched, but then when it comes to movies, especially Nazi occult movies, sometimes logic has to be suspended.If there was one aspect that I really had a problem with, it would be the scenes involving fire and the horses.  The special effects were downright amateurish and really took away from the film.",4,Blood Creek - not too bad,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,2050,"['possible', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'one', '3', '1/2', 'think', 'better', 'three', 'not', 'sure', '4', 'stars', 'acting', 'good', 'premise', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'holes', 'story', 'line', 'special', 'effects', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'think', 'genre', 'will', 'have', 'limited', 'appeal.As', 'said', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'good', 'Nazi-occult', 'genre', 'Nazi', 'official', 'visits', 'immigrant', 'German', 'farm', 'family', 'Virginia', '1930s', 'where', 'sinister', 'occult', 'intentions', 'become', 'known', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'end', 'result', 'family', 'four', 'then', 'held', 'prisoner', 'farm', 'time', 'stop', 'aging', 'forced', 'serve', 'Nazi', 'monster', 'serving', 'years', ""'ve"", 'trapped', 'unsuspecting', 'campers', 'fishermen', 'use', 'monster', 'one', 'holes', 'plot', 'pointed', 'out', 'reviewer', 'one', 'investigated', 'farm', 'area', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'disappeared', 'years', 'story', 'hole', 'neighbors', 'anyone', 'family', 'business', 'noticed', 'family', ""n't"", 'aged', '60', 'years', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'same', 'farm', 'drive', 'truck', 'needing', 'gas', 'sell', 'produce', 'locally', 'one', 'noticed', 'One', 'victims', 'character', 'played', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'younger', 'brother', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'go', 'back', 'farm', 'stop', 'horror', 'process', 'full', 'story', 'revealed', 'battle', 'ensues', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'etc', '.Overall', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'Cavill', 'decent', 'generic', 'American', 'accent', 'are', 'superfluous', 'scenes', 'even', 'early', 'scenes', 'Cavill', 'Cavill', 'Purcell', 'back', 'story', 'decisions', 'characters', 'seem', 'far-fetched', 'then', 'when', 'movies', 'especially', 'Nazi', 'occult', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'be', 'suspended.If', 'was', 'one', 'aspect', 'really', 'had', 'problem', 'would', 'be', 'scenes', 'involving', 'fire', 'horses', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'downright', 'amateurish', 'really', 'took', 'away', 'film']",Blood Creek

1290587,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B002USF1TU,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","For every good Joel Schumacher movie, he's got a handful of truly, mind-bogglingly awful ones. On one hand, ""Lost Boys."" On the other, ""Batman and Robin."" ""Blood Creek"" is perhaps the first Schumacher movie I've yet seen that is just sort of mediocre. The first part is hideously confusing (it took me awhile to figure out who was related to whom), but it's a decent movie for people who like blood, guts and gritty backdrops.In 1936, a small German farm family was visited by Professor Wirth (Michael Fassbender), an occult investigator for the Nazi regime. He came to West Virginia to investigate an ancient Viking runestone that is build into the foundation of the Wollners' barn.Fast-forward eighty years. Ever since his older brother Victor vanished during a camping trip, Evan Marshall (Henry Cavill) has had to care for his aged father, sister-in-law and young nephews. Then one night, Victor (Dominic Purcell) reappears, looking like a crazed hermit. After a shower and shave, he immediately drags Evan out to the Hollners' farm, seeking revenge.It turns out that the Hollners -- who haven't aged in decades -- have been capturing people and extracting their blood, and Victor has been their prisoner for the past few years. But they aren't the real danger. That would be Wirth, who is still alive (sort of), able to control the dead, and seeking human blood for the grotesque magic he gains from the runestone.""Blood Creek"" is a pretty simple story -- two guys go to get revenge against immortal Germans, only to be trapped in a dusty rural farmhouse by a literally bloodthirsty necromancer who wants to become all-powerful. Okay, it sounds a little less simple when put that way. But most of the horror boils down to a ghoulish-looking Fassbender stalking around the farm, using zombie animals to break into the house.However, the first third of the movie is a chore to sit through. There's an onslaught of shakycam that nearly made me sick (particularly during the meth bust). And Schumacher doesn't really enlighten us about some of what is going on -- I didn't figure out that the Grizzly Adams guy was Victor until a few scenes after he appeared.Fortunately, both the camera and script stabilize after the brothers invade the Hollner farm. After night falls, the entire story just becomes a gruesome nightmare of blood, white-eyed zombies and a crumbling farmhouse being battered from every direction. It's not particularly scary, but it's got a satisfying amount of blood'n'gore, and the denouement isn't too unbelievable.It also has a pretty decent cast -- a pre-fame Henry Cavill and Michael Fassbender, both of whom are giving performances way too good for the movie they're in. Even Dominic Purcell, who normally leaves me indifferent, gives a very powerful performance as a haunted veteran driven almost to madness. Cavill's character is the exact opposite, a compassionate and clever man who is riddled with guilt about his brother's loss.And Fassbender... well, you can't see him most of the time, due to bloodied bandages and lots of shadow. But he is genuinely scary as a man who was monstrous to begin with, and became a true monster once he got access to magic.""Blood Creek"" is a resolutely mediocre onslaught of blood, darkness and zombies, but the performances by Purcell, Cavill and Fassbender make it worth watching.",3,Power in the blood,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,3346,"['good', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'movie', 'got', 'handful', 'truly', 'mind-bogglingly', 'awful', 'ones', 'one', 'hand', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'other', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Blood', 'Creek', 'perhaps', 'first', 'Schumacher', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'just', 'sort', 'mediocre', 'first', 'part', 'hideously', 'confusing', 'took', 'awhile', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'related', 'whom', 'decent', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'blood', 'guts', 'gritty', 'backdrops.In', '1936', 'small', 'German', 'farm', 'family', 'was', 'visited', 'Professor', 'Wirth', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'occult', 'investigator', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'came', 'West', 'Virginia', 'investigate', 'ancient', 'Viking', 'runestone', 'build', 'foundation', 'Wollners', 'barn.Fast-forward', 'eighty', 'years', 'Ever', 'older', 'brother', 'Victor', 'vanished', 'camping', 'trip', 'Evan', 'Marshall', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'had', 'care', 'aged', 'father', 'sister-in-law', 'young', 'nephews', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'Victor', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'reappears', 'looking', 'crazed', 'hermit', 'shower', 'shave', 'immediately', 'drags', 'Evan', 'Hollners', 'farm', 'seeking', 'revenge.It', 'out', 'Hollners', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'decades', 'have', 'been', 'capturing', 'people', 'extracting', 'blood', 'Victor', 'been', 'prisoner', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'danger', 'would', 'be', 'Wirth', 'who', 'still', 'alive', 'sort', 'able', 'control', 'dead', 'seeking', 'human', 'blood', 'grotesque', 'magic', 'gains', 'runestone', 'Blood', 'Creek', 'pretty', 'simple', 'story', 'two', 'guys', 'go', 'get', 'revenge', 'immortal', 'Germans', 'only', 'be', 'trapped', 'dusty', 'rural', 'farmhouse', 'literally', 'bloodthirsty', 'necromancer', 'who', 'become', 'all-powerful', 'Okay', 'little', 'less', 'simple', 'when', 'put', 'way', 'most', 'horror', 'down', 'ghoulish-looking', 'Fassbender', 'stalking', 'farm', 'using', 'zombie', 'animals', 'break', 'house.However', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'chore', 'sit', 'onslaught', 'shakycam', 'nearly', 'made', 'sick', 'particularly', 'meth', 'bust', 'Schumacher', ""n't"", 'really', 'enlighten', 'what', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'Grizzly', 'Adams', 'guy', 'was', 'Victor', 'few', 'scenes', 'appeared.Fortunately', 'camera', 'script', 'stabilize', 'brothers', 'invade', 'Hollner', 'farm', 'night', 'falls', 'entire', 'story', 'just', 'gruesome', 'nightmare', 'blood', 'white-eyed', 'zombies', 'crumbling', 'farmhouse', 'being', 'battered', 'direction', 'not', 'particularly', 'scary', 'got', 'satisfying', 'amount', 'blood', ""n'gore"", 'denouement', ""n't"", 'too', 'unbelievable.It', 'also', 'pretty', 'decent', 'cast', 'pre-fame', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'whom', 'are', 'giving', 'performances', 'way', 'too', 'good', 'movie', ""'re"", 'Even', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'who', 'normally', 'indifferent', 'very', 'powerful', 'performance', 'haunted', 'veteran', 'driven', 'almost', 'madness', 'Cavill', 'character', 'exact', 'opposite', 'compassionate', 'clever', 'man', 'who', 'riddled', 'guilt', 'brother', 'loss.And', 'Fassbender', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'most', 'time', 'due', 'bloodied', 'bandages', 'lots', 'shadow', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'monstrous', 'begin', 'became', 'true', 'monster', 'once', 'got', 'access', 'magic', 'Blood', 'Creek', 'resolutely', 'mediocre', 'onslaught', 'blood', 'darkness', 'zombies', 'performances', 'Purcell', 'Cavill', 'Fassbender', 'make', 'worth', 'watching']",Blood Creek
1290588,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B002USF1TU,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Though Joel Schumacher has had some high points in his career, much of his work has been very middle-of-the-road. He's not generally much of a stylist. He just works the script. Here he ramps things up a bit on the visual side but the script isn't supporting him.Here's the scoop. It's 1936. Hitler is on the move. He's got some of his agents combing the world for particular relics with magical powers to help the Nazi cause. Some of his agents hit the States looking for Rune Stones left by the Vikings. One agent comes across one on a farm in Virginia. Jump ahead to now and various people go missing periodically around this farm. One young guy, who thought he lost his brother on a fishing trip two years prior, finds his brother has returned and wants to recruit him to do vengeance on everyone at said farm. Of course it turns out things are more complicated than that.The whole Nazi/ occult thing has become more prominent over the years. Some people have realized that this was not just some pipe dream imagined by the lunatic fringe. Hollywood has worked it with varying degrees of success. Here it's not played too well. It's just not a very good script. You find out, pretty early on, that this particular Nazi agent has learned a few magical tricks. But it escalates to such an over the top degree that it almost becomes cartoonish. And there is some pretty stupid stuff at hand. For instance: How could this farm stand for some 50 plus years, with runic symbols painted, in a garish red, over all the doors and windows with no one ever trying to investigate? And has no official ever gone to the farm to even inquire about the people that have been disappearing at regular intervals? And the daughter. She seems to know enough where they could have done this Nazi pig in long ago. Little of all this makes sense.The acting is decent enough. I'm not a great fan of Dominic Purcell.

But at least this very minor effort by Joel Schumacher continues his tradition of introducing fine lads to the screen in hopes of launching a career (Colin Farrell in TIGERLAND is a typical example).  The story/screenplay by David Kajganich tries very hard to be substantial (Viking runes were left in about eight farms and the Nazi's preoccupation with the occult made them spend years tacking them down - the runes being a means toward immortality if you drink the right blood yada yada yada...), but in the end this is just another of the genre as SAW 1 - 6(?), Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Halloween 1 - 5, etc. If lots of blood and crazy behavior on a farm in dark territory inhabited by ageless creatures under the spell of a crazy guy is what rocks your boat, then welcome aboard.The redeeming factor in the movie is the presence of Henry Cavill (of the Tudor series fame and fine actor waiting to be used in some choice roles) and Dominic Purcell.  As brothers bent on vengeance they make the most of this plot, giving it as much dignity  as could be expected.  They deserve better material as they are both fine actors and personalities.  So Joel Schumacher can't really be run out of town for this movie - he at least gave the two primary actors the chance for screen time. Only or those who love gore.

We soon discover he is into the occult and here on a quest for the Third Reich's search for mystical ruins left by their forefathers, the Vikings.

The brothers soon discover however that there is more going on with this family then what it seems however, dating back to the days of World War II when a Nazi scholar (Michael Fassbender of Inglourious Basterds) unleashed something dangerous, blood thirsty, and immortal.  With disagreements between Schumacher and the film's screenwriter, it's no wonder Blood Creek sat on Lions Gate's shelf for as long as it did.  The script is all over the place and often confusing, while a good amount of the film's CGI effects are pretty bad as well.

However once the movie started I was immediately intrigued and drawn in. It was actually not half bad, it wouldn't win any Oscars but it was certainly better than a lot of movies I have gone to see in theaters over the years. The story was interesting and original, the acting wasn't too bad, it was well directed and edited with plenty of supernatural horror mixed with fast paced action sequences.I think this is one of those movies that will appeal to certain people and appeal not at all to certain others.

And since &lt;em>The Client&lt;/em>, Schumacher has been on a pretty steady downward slide, with each film getting worse and worse (no, I will not make an exception for the vastly overrated &lt;em>Tigerland&lt;/em>, thanks for asking [viz. review November 2002 ish]). And then, in 2009, came &lt;em>Blood Creek&lt;/em>, a film around which tremedous rumor has swirled regarding just how much of the script belongs to credited scriptwriter David Kajganich and how much was rewritten by Schumacher (unfortunately, everything I've found so far is entirely unsubstantiated). One way or the other, this is where Schumacher simply fell off the cliff.Plot: Victor Marshall (&lt;em>Prison Break&lt;/em> cutie Domic Purcell) vanished, seemingly without a trace, two years before the movie opens, while he and his brother Evan (&lt;em>Immortals&lt;/em>' Henry Cavill) were on a camping trip. And we could have had a movie about a guy dealing with the loss of his brother, but no: soon after the film starts, Victor turns up, tattered and much the worse for wear, and tells Evan that he has been held captive for the past two years by the Wollners, a local, reclusive family of German farmers. Evan loads up the SUV and away they go to get some answers and shed some blood--but when they get there, they discover that the Wollners are much more than they seem--they are undead thralls to Nazi scientist Richard Wirth (&lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>'s Michael Fassbender), sent to the farm in the 1930s to look for a runestone said to be one of a set of nine conveying the secrets of immortality. The family are desperate for release from the monstrous doctor, and so are willing to get out of the way of the brothers' quest for vengeance--though not willing to do much to help.All of which could probably have made for a good survival horror film, had the script been in any way worthwhile. (Again unsubstantiated, but a post in the IMDB forum for this film was written by someone who claims to have read both drafts, and says that Kajganich's script &lt;em>is&lt;/em>.) As it stands, it's... awful. And when I say ""awful"" I mean ""I'll give oyu a call when I come up with one redeeming feature about the film, save that it is not in any way patently offensive, but don't hold your breath."" Over the course of my movie-viewing career, I have turned off, with no intention of finishing, less than a dozen movies. I seriously considered it where &lt;em>Blood Creek&lt;/em> was concerned. And, having instead sat through the entire horrific concoction, I'm here to tell you: I wouldn't have missed a damn thing of consequence.

1290608,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B002USF1TU,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[0, 0]","Joel Schumacher has been making movies for a very long time, and while not ever looked upon as a great director, he has made some classics.  He's given us Grisham thrillers(The Client, A Time To Kill), suspense thrillers(8MM, Phonebooth, The Number 23), goofy comedies(Car Wash, The Incredible Shrinking Woman), and single-handedly ruined the Batman franchise(Batman Forever, Batman & Robin).  He's dabbled in many genres, but a straight to video Nazi themed horror film is not something I would have expected from him.  Sure he dabbled a bit in horror with The Lost Boys and Flatliners, but those were kind of pop-horror, especially The Lost Boys.  I'm not saying those films were bad by any means, I love them both.  Blood Creek is a different beast altogether though.Henry Cavill plays a paramedic who's brother had gone missing two years prior.  One night, his brother, Dominic Purcell, returns and immediately drags Cavill along with him on a search and destroy revenge mission on a small farm up Town(Blood)Creek.  Purcell had been captured and held prisoner on this farm by a family that had taken in a German lodger back in the 30s.  This German, Michael Fassbender, was actually a Nazi carrying out experiments with the occult on orders from Hitler.  You know, that whole Third Reich/occult thing.Fassbender was one of many Nazis assigned to track down ancient runestones scattered across the country.  They hold the secret to immortality along with blood drinking rituals and other hocus pocus.  As a result, Fassbender has lived all these years, growing more and more powerful.  The family he lived with also has caught the immortality bug, but sometime along the way, they all realized Fassbender's evil plans and have kept him imprisoned on their farm all these years.  The catch is the occasional blood sacrifice victim that's needed to keep Fassbender from being unleashed into the world.  Purcell was one of those blood donors until he got away, and now he's back with his brother, Cavill, to go all out Bronson on the family and Fassbender.What follows is the standard Night of the Living Dead scenario with Purcell, Cavill, and the immortal family trapped inside the farmhouse(Fassbender cannot enter the house), fighting off Fassbender and his gang of resurrected humans and farm animals.It's as schlocky as it sounds, and as fun as it sounds too.  Schumacher may be a Hollywood heavy hitter, but this movie is as direct to video as it comes....with a higher budget and better production values than most.  It's fast paced, violent, gory, and best of all it's entertaining.Yeah, it's not 100% original, there's some crappy CGI, there's some plot holes(why does the immortal family look fine, but Fassbender looks all mummified and gruesome?  That's one of many questions you could ask), but who really cares?  This is a Nazi-themed horror film, and those aren't really known for being great examples of American Film making.Considering the avalanche of straight to video horror films available, most of which disappoint, Blood Creek manages to rise above many of them and delivers the goods.Joel Schumacher-who knew??",4,It Is Better Than Batman & Robin!,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,3136,"['Joel', 'Schumacher', 'been', 'making', 'movies', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'ever', 'looked', 'great', 'director', 'made', 'classics', 'given', 'Grisham', 'thrillers', 'Client', 'A', 'Time', 'Kill', 'suspense', 'thrillers', '8MM', 'Phonebooth', 'Number', '23', 'goofy', 'comedies', 'Car', 'Wash', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Woman', 'single-handedly', 'ruined', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'dabbled', 'many', 'genres', 'straight', 'video', 'Nazi', 'themed', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'dabbled', 'bit', 'horror', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Flatliners', 'were', 'kind', 'pop-horror', 'especially', 'Lost', 'Boys', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'films', 'were', 'bad', 'means', 'love', 'Blood', 'Creek', 'different', 'beast', 'altogether', 'though.Henry', 'Cavill', 'paramedic', 'who', 'brother', 'had', 'gone', 'missing', 'two', 'years', 'prior', 'One', 'night', 'brother', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'returns', 'immediately', 'drags', 'Cavill', 'search', 'destroy', 'revenge', 'mission', 'small', 'farm', 'up', 'Town', 'Blood', 'Creek', 'Purcell', 'had', 'been', 'captured', 'held', 'prisoner', 'farm', 'family', 'had', 'taken', 'German', 'lodger', 'back', '30s', 'German', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'was', 'actually', 'Nazi', 'carrying', 'out', 'experiments', 'occult', 'orders', 'Hitler', 'know', 'whole', 'Third', 'Reich/occult', 'thing.Fassbender', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'Nazis', 'assigned', 'track', 'down', 'ancient', 'runestones', 'scattered', 'country', 'hold', 'secret', 'immortality', 'blood', 'drinking', 'rituals', 'other', 'hocus', 'pocus', 'result', 'Fassbender', 'lived', 'years', 'growing', 'more', 'more', 'powerful', 'family', 'lived', 'also', 'caught', 'immortality', 'bug', 'sometime', 'way', 'realized', 'Fassbender', 'evil', 'plans', 'have', 'kept', 'imprisoned', 'farm', 'years', 'catch', 'occasional', 'blood', 'sacrifice', 'victim', 'needed', 'keep', 'Fassbender', 'being', 'unleashed', 'world', 'Purcell', 'was', 'one', 'blood', 'donors', 'got', 'away', 'now', 'back', 'brother', 'Cavill', 'go', 'out', 'Bronson', 'family', 'Fassbender.What', 'standard', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'scenario', 'Purcell', 'Cavill', 'immortal', 'family', 'trapped', 'farmhouse', 'Fassbender', 'can', 'not', 'enter', 'house', 'fighting', 'off', 'Fassbender', 'gang', 'resurrected', 'humans', 'farm', 'animals.It', 'as', 'schlocky', 'as', 'fun', 'too', 'Schumacher', 'may', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'heavy', 'hitter', 'movie', 'direct', 'video', 'higher', 'budget', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'most', 'fast', 'paced', 'violent', 'gory', 'best', 'entertaining.Yeah', 'not', '100', '%', 'original', 'crappy', 'CGI', 'plot', 'holes', 'why', 'immortal', 'family', 'look', 'fine', 'Fassbender', 'mummified', 'gruesome', 'one', 'many', 'questions', 'could', 'ask', 'who', 'really', 'Nazi-themed', 'horror', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'known', 'being', 'great', 'examples', 'American', 'Film', 'making.Considering', 'avalanche', 'straight', 'video', 'horror', 'films', 'available', 'most', 'disappoint', 'Blood', 'Creek', 'rise', 'many', 'goods.Joel', 'Schumacher-who', 'knew']",Blood Creek

1290610,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B002USF1TU,Stuart Conover,"[2, 3]","Its original UK release had the film known as Town Creek but the name was changed to Blood Creek when it was released in the United States. The film was directed by Joel Schumacher who has quite a few amazing films under his belt (including a personal favorite of mine 8MM) though also quite a few that fell short. While not all of his work falls into horror he does have a few key films set in both horror and suspense and knows how to put a film together. The writing credit falls to David Kajganich who is a little newer having only one screenplay written before it. The quality of his work shows through quite well through this one and he has 3 more movies being written. My only worry is that two of them are remakes of classics and I hope he writes the screenplays for It and Pet Cemetery in a way to do them justice as pissing off the Stephen King fans, with remakes of 2 classic films, will surely hurt his chances for much after that.Now going into this film I had heard mixed reviews. After seeing the film I ultimately believe it was a bias against Schumacher for a few of his films that were utterly painful to watch. If you can put those thoughts aside while watching the film as I did I believe you'll have a great time. We open with a German family on a farm in the middle of nowhere in the World War 2 era who receive a letter that a scholar is coming to stay on their farm. While the mother is against the idea initially the check they are offered to keep the scholar up swayed any decision against finding out more away and they agreed to do it. His first night there he points out that Germany will soon rule the world and we find out he is on a mission for the Nazi regime to recover ancient artifacts that can provide immortality. Apparently there were multiple artifacts left in the United States when ancient Vikings first found the continent and the Nazi's want them. The scholar that comes to town, Professor Wirth (Michael Fassbender), finds the first relic and ends the introduction apparently cutting the daughter and fading out of scene.We cut to modern day as the modern day as a man, Evan Marshall (Henry Cavill), is being lectured by his father that his older brother, Victor (Dominic Purcell), has been missing for over two years and blames him for it happening. That night out of the blue the older brother reappears and insists there is no time and they need to go out immediately to have revenge on the family that has kept him captive and tortured him for the past 2 years. While his brother is at first hesitant just happy his brother is back when he sees the scars on his back he agrees to go with him. We see them sneak up on the house where the family is at (which is the same house shown in the introduction) and once we have the family rounded up appear to be seeing the same family from nearly 60 years before -un ravaged by the passage of time. Soon after the Nazi shown in the introduction reappears, infused with power making him stronger than a normal man and quite angry for the situation he is described to be in.This movie was a true shock on how well it was portrayed. When you combine a lower budget film (even with amazing production value) with a Nazi mastermind who is nearly immortal and went straight to DVD you expect nothing great. When you keep in mind that a large slew of his films haven't been great you will further be worried. Don't be. If it at all sounds like something you may enjoy watching I recommend picking it up immediately as I was truly surprised at how enjoyable and worth watching this film was.",4,A movie I only wish had a sequel in the works!,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,3574,"['original', 'UK', 'release', 'had', 'film', 'known', 'Town', 'Creek', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'Blood', 'Creek', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'who', 'quite', 'few', 'amazing', 'films', 'belt', 'including', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', '8MM', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'fell', 'short', 'not', 'work', 'horror', 'have', 'few', 'key', 'films', 'set', 'horror', 'suspense', 'how', 'put', 'film', 'together', 'writing', 'credit', 'falls', 'David', 'Kajganich', 'who', 'little', 'newer', 'having', 'only', 'one', 'screenplay', 'written', 'quality', 'work', 'shows', 'quite', 'well', 'one', '3', 'more', 'movies', 'being', 'written', 'only', 'worry', 'two', 'are', 'remakes', 'classics', 'hope', 'screenplays', 'Pet', 'Cemetery', 'way', 'do', 'justice', 'pissing', 'off', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fans', 'remakes', '2', 'classic', 'films', 'will', 'surely', 'hurt', 'chances', 'much', 'that.Now', 'going', 'film', 'had', 'heard', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'seeing', 'film', 'ultimately', 'believe', 'was', 'bias', 'Schumacher', 'few', 'films', 'were', 'utterly', 'painful', 'watch', 'can', 'put', 'thoughts', 'aside', 'watching', 'film', 'did', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'have', 'great', 'time', 'open', 'German', 'family', 'farm', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'World', 'War', '2', 'era', 'who', 'receive', 'letter', 'scholar', 'coming', 'stay', 'farm', 'mother', 'idea', 'initially', 'check', 'are', 'offered', 'keep', 'scholar', 'up', 'swayed', 'decision', 'finding', 'out', 'more', 'away', 'agreed', 'do', 'first', 'night', 'there', 'out', 'Germany', 'will', 'soon', 'rule', 'world', 'find', 'out', 'mission', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'recover', 'ancient', 'artifacts', 'can', 'provide', 'immortality', 'Apparently', 'were', 'multiple', 'artifacts', 'left', 'United', 'States', 'when', 'ancient', 'Vikings', 'first', 'found', 'continent', 'Nazi', 'want', 'scholar', 'town', 'Professor', 'Wirth', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'first', 'relic', 'introduction', 'apparently', 'cutting', 'daughter', 'fading', 'scene.We', 'cut', 'modern', 'day', 'modern', 'day', 'man', 'Evan', 'Marshall', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'being', 'lectured', 'father', 'older', 'brother', 'Victor', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'been', 'missing', 'two', 'years', 'happening', 'night', 'blue', 'older', 'brother', 'reappears', 'insists', 'time', 'need', 'go', 'out', 'immediately', 'have', 'revenge', 'family', 'kept', 'captive', 'tortured', 'past', '2', 'years', 'brother', 'first', 'hesitant', 'just', 'happy', 'brother', 'back', 'when', 'scars', 'back', 'go', 'see', 'sneak', 'up', 'house', 'where', 'family', 'same', 'house', 'shown', 'introduction', 'once', 'have', 'family', 'rounded', 'up', 'appear', 'be', 'seeing', 'same', 'family', 'nearly', '60', 'years', '-un', 'ravaged', 'passage', 'time', 'Soon', 'Nazi', 'shown', 'introduction', 'reappears', 'infused', 'power', 'making', 'stronger', 'normal', 'man', 'quite', 'angry', 'situation', 'described', 'be', 'in.This', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'shock', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'portrayed', 'When', 'combine', 'lower', 'budget', 'film', 'even', 'amazing', 'production', 'value', 'Nazi', 'mastermind', 'who', 'nearly', 'immortal', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'expect', 'nothing', 'great', 'When', 'keep', 'mind', 'large', 'slew', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'great', 'will', 'further', 'be', 'worried', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'sounds', 'something', 'may', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'immediately', 'was', 'truly', 'surprised', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'was']",Blood Creek

1290612,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002USF1TU,trebe,"[1, 1]","As the years go by, incorporating the Nazis as part of a contemporary story becomes less common, but the supernatural horror thriller Blood Creek (2009) comes up with a new wrinkle that kind of works.  Directed by Joel Schumacher (Batman And Robin, Phone Booth, Flatliners, A Time To Kill, Falling Down), the story has a number of problems, but within the strange reality the film establishes, things hold together pretty well, in what is a tense, well-paced thriller that has more than a few surprises.  Some spoilers follow, so stop here if you must.The story begins in 1936, when the Nazi hierarchy, influenced by Hitler's belief in the occult and divine destiny, send a professor named Richard Wirth (Michael Fassbender) to a small farm in West Virginia.  Firth is interested in a large carved rune stone that was discovered on the property, owned by the Wollner family.A mysterious evil is unleashed at that time, and is still alive and well, when the story picks up some seventy years in the future, as military veteran Victor Marshall (Dominic Purcell) disappears while camping, leaving behind a wife and two kids.  After being missing for two years, Victor's brother Evan (Henry Cavill), a paramedic, is shocked when his long lost brother, unexpected shows up at his trailer home.Victor doesn't tell his brother much, but convinces him to grab some guns and ammo, and head off in a boat for what turns out to be the Wollner farm.  There the brothers and what remains of the Wollner family form a strange alliance, and try to conquer a greater evil.Moving along at a quick pace, Blood Creek doesn't always present a narrative that is credible, but the actual story that is behind the events quite compelling.  It is a twisted blend of suspense, mythology, the supernatural, torture, and the consumption of human blood.  The strange being that Wirth has become, is tremendously powerful, and is on the verge of becoming unstoppable.  The Marshall brothers have taken refuge inside the Wollner home, and the only thing keeping Wirth from entering the house and killing everyone, are runic symbols painted on the doors and windows.  Wirth however has the power to bring the dead back to life, and he sends re-animated humans and even a horse, to strike where he cannot tread.Wirth's survival and development, depends on his feeding on the blood of live victims.  Cuts are made on the victim's back, and Wirth sucks the blood from the flesh.  Liese (Emma Booth) the daughter of the farmer Wollner, was his first victim.  Her blood nourished his early development, until her father Otto (Rainer Winkelvoss) found a way to control Wirth, and keep him contained on the farm.  As long as Wirth lives, the Wollner family does not age.  Through the decades, unfortunate victims like Victor and Luke (Shea Wigham), have been taken prisoner by the Wollners, to providing sustenance for the beast.The acting performances are quite good, really helping to sell the unusual situation.  Michael Fassbender makes a formidable villain, while Dominic Purcell, Henry Cavill, and Shea Wigham also give solid performances.  And as the Wollners, Emma Stone, Rainer Winkelvoss, and Joy McBrinn as Grandmother Wollner, are all very good.Blood Creek has some big gaps in logic, but manages to mix together several familiar horror themes and spice things up with some creative ideas.  Wirth is a riveting figure, and the film delivers some solid scares, and has a number of well executed and edgy action sequences.  Joel Schumacher does a more than competent job of directing, and provides some interesting insights in his commentary, that helps fill in some of the gaps.  Considering the material, Schumacher's attitude is somewhat flippant, but then horror is perhaps not really his cup of tea.",4,"the legacy of nazi evil lives on in secrecy for decades, on a small West Virginia farm...",1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,3776,"['years', 'go', 'incorporating', 'Nazis', 'part', 'contemporary', 'story', 'less', 'common', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'thriller', 'Blood', 'Creek', '2009', 'up', 'new', 'wrinkle', 'kind', 'works', 'Directed', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Flatliners', 'A', 'Time', 'Kill', 'Falling', 'Down', 'story', 'number', 'problems', 'strange', 'reality', 'film', 'establishes', 'things', 'hold', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'what', 'tense', 'well-paced', 'thriller', 'more', 'few', 'surprises', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'stop', 'here', 'must.The', 'story', 'begins', '1936', 'when', 'Nazi', 'hierarchy', 'influenced', 'Hitler', 'belief', 'occult', 'divine', 'destiny', 'send', 'professor', 'named', 'Richard', 'Wirth', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'small', 'farm', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Firth', 'interested', 'large', 'carved', 'rune', 'stone', 'was', 'discovered', 'property', 'owned', 'Wollner', 'family.A', 'mysterious', 'evil', 'unleashed', 'time', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'when', 'story', 'up', 'seventy', 'years', 'future', 'military', 'veteran', 'Victor', 'Marshall', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'camping', 'leaving', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'being', 'missing', 'two', 'years', 'Victor', 'brother', 'Evan', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'paramedic', 'shocked', 'when', 'long', 'lost', 'brother', 'unexpected', 'up', 'trailer', 'home.Victor', ""n't"", 'tell', 'brother', 'much', 'grab', 'guns', 'ammo', 'head', 'off', 'boat', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'Wollner', 'farm', 'brothers', 'what', 'Wollner', 'family', 'form', 'strange', 'alliance', 'try', 'conquer', 'greater', 'evil.Moving', 'along', 'quick', 'pace', 'Blood', 'Creek', ""n't"", 'always', 'present', 'narrative', 'credible', 'actual', 'story', 'events', 'quite', 'compelling', 'twisted', 'blend', 'suspense', 'mythology', 'supernatural', 'torture', 'consumption', 'human', 'blood', 'strange', 'being', 'Wirth', 'become', 'tremendously', 'powerful', 'verge', 'becoming', 'unstoppable', 'Marshall', 'brothers', 'have', 'taken', 'refuge', 'Wollner', 'home', 'only', 'thing', 'keeping', 'Wirth', 'entering', 'house', 'killing', 'everyone', 'are', 'runic', 'symbols', 'painted', 'doors', 'windows', 'Wirth', 'however', 'power', 'bring', 'dead', 'back', 'life', 're-animated', 'humans', 'even', 'horse', 'strike', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'tread.Wirth', 'survival', 'development', 'feeding', 'blood', 'live', 'victims', 'Cuts', 'are', 'made', 'victim', 'back', 'Wirth', 'blood', 'flesh', 'Liese', 'Emma', 'Booth', 'daughter', 'farmer', 'Wollner', 'was', 'first', 'victim', 'blood', 'nourished', 'early', 'development', 'father', 'Otto', 'Rainer', 'Winkelvoss', 'found', 'way', 'control', 'Wirth', 'keep', 'contained', 'farm', 'As', 'long', 'Wirth', 'Wollner', 'family', 'not', 'age', 'decades', 'unfortunate', 'victims', 'Victor', 'Luke', 'Shea', 'Wigham', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Wollners', 'providing', 'sustenance', 'beast.The', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'really', 'helping', 'sell', 'unusual', 'situation', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'formidable', 'villain', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Shea', 'Wigham', 'also', 'give', 'solid', 'performances', 'Wollners', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Rainer', 'Winkelvoss', 'Joy', 'McBrinn', 'Grandmother', 'Wollner', 'are', 'very', 'good.Blood', 'Creek', 'big', 'gaps', 'logic', 'mix', 'together', 'several', 'familiar', 'horror', 'themes', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'creative', 'ideas', 'Wirth', 'riveting', 'figure', 'film', 'solid', 'scares', 'number', 'well', 'executed', 'edgy', 'action', 'sequences', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'more', 'competent', 'job', 'directing', 'interesting', 'insights', 'commentary', 'fill', 'gaps', 'Considering', 'material', 'Schumacher', 'attitude', 'somewhat', 'flippant', 'then', 'horror', 'perhaps', 'not', 'really', 'cup', 'tea']",Blood Creek

I'm a fan of Dominic Purcell and Michael Fassender, so I thought this movie was good. It's about a creature created by the Nazi's back before WWII and how he needs human blood to stay alive with power. Dominic Purcell plays one of his kidnapped and tortured victims who escapes and along with his younger brother goes back for revenge. I love movies that have occult overtones to it and there's plenty of gory action. I recommend it for horror and action movie fans.",5,Good movie and lots of action!,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,517,"['saw', 'movie', 'first', 'cable', 'liked', 'alot', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'Michael', 'Fassender', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'creature', 'created', 'Nazi', 'back', 'WWII', 'how', 'human', 'blood', 'stay', 'alive', 'power', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'one', 'kidnapped', 'tortured', 'victims', 'who', 'escapes', 'younger', 'brother', 'back', 'revenge', 'love', 'movies', 'have', 'occult', 'overtones', 'plenty', 'gory', 'action', 'recommend', 'horror', 'action', 'movie', 'fans']",Blood Creek
