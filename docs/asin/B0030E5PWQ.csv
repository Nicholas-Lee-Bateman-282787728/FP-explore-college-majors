1315358,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B0030E5PWQ,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[4, 6]","Steven Seagal has had quite a rebirth in 2009-2010. His reality show has become a huge hit, and his two latest films, ""The Keeper"" and ""A Dangerous Man"" have found him using less stunt doubles and going back to his famous brand of wrist and neck snapping karate.While ""The Keeper"" was by far his best DTV film, this one is better. For one thing, the cast is much better, and there are no spots in the film that drag. The plot is a familiar one....Seagal is a former special-ops who is down and out after serving 6 years in prison for a crime in which he was not guilty. After he is released, he witnesses a kidnapping/robbery that has connections not only to the Chinese and Russian mobs but also there is corruption deep within the police department. Since Seagal cannot go to the police, he actually befriends the Russians and wages an all-out war in an attempt to rescue a young woman and stop the Chinese from delivering their goods.There are quite a few explosions, and Seagal does a lot of hand-to-hand combat, much of it in very close quarters. The production and filming is of better quality, so you can actually SEE the entire fight scenes, and the dialogue and characters all make sense and have a purpose in this film. There is still some dubbing of Seagal's voice at times, but it is forgiveable given the amount of action this film offers.At this stage, Seagal may not make another film that rivals his box office topping glory days. But he doesn't have to. He just has to give the fans what they want, which is a huge amount of revenge-styled fighting and no-holds-barred action....and this film is loaded with it. The only thing missing in this one is his occasional humor....and perhaps that is intentional. Seagal has not been this focused or intent on delivering a quality product in quite some time. 4.5 stars.",5,The Best Seagal Flick in Years,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,1829,"['Steven', 'Seagal', 'had', 'quite', 'rebirth', '2009-2010', 'reality', 'show', 'become', 'huge', 'hit', 'two', 'latest', 'films', 'Keeper', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'have', 'found', 'using', 'less', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'going', 'back', 'famous', 'brand', 'wrist', 'neck', 'snapping', 'karate.While', 'Keeper', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'DTV', 'film', 'one', 'better', 'one', 'thing', 'cast', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'spots', 'film', 'drag', 'plot', 'familiar', 'one', '.Seagal', 'former', 'special-ops', 'who', 'down', 'serving', '6', 'years', 'prison', 'crime', 'was', 'not', 'guilty', 'released', 'kidnapping/robbery', 'connections', 'not', 'only', 'Chinese', 'Russian', 'mobs', 'also', 'corruption', 'deep', 'police', 'department', 'Seagal', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'police', 'actually', 'Russians', 'wages', 'all-out', 'war', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'young', 'woman', 'stop', 'Chinese', 'delivering', 'goods.There', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'explosions', 'Seagal', 'lot', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'much', 'very', 'close', 'quarters', 'production', 'filming', 'better', 'quality', 'can', 'actually', 'SEE', 'entire', 'fight', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'make', 'sense', 'have', 'purpose', 'film', 'still', 'dubbing', 'Seagal', 'voice', 'times', 'forgiveable', 'given', 'amount', 'action', 'film', 'stage', 'Seagal', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'box', 'office', 'topping', 'glory', 'days', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'give', 'fans', 'what', 'want', 'huge', 'amount', 'revenge-styled', 'fighting', 'no-holds-barred', 'action', '.and', 'film', 'loaded', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'one', 'occasional', 'humor', '.and', 'perhaps', 'intentional', 'Seagal', 'not', 'been', 'focused', 'intent', 'delivering', 'quality', 'product', 'quite', 'time', '4.5', 'stars']",N/A

1315361,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0030E5PWQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[6, 12]","The top review here is excellent and insightful. Pity that this film is one of the WORST Seagal films I have ever had to endure. One of my favorite of his ""bad"" films is ""Belly of the Beast"" (2003), which I've mentioned before for its flaws yet brilliant overall structure. Liam Neeson took a great deal away from Seagal in his remake of this film, ""Taken"" (2008).What of this obsession with ""Beast""? Well, it has all of Seagal's oddities in full view. However that may be, ""A Dangerous Man"" should have been called ""A Dangerous Mess of Cinematic Blunders"". The reviewer who so eloquently leads the reviews asked a question: why is Seagal getting his voice dubbed over by someone else?Let me address to the viewer what I think has been going on with Seagal: I think he's old, fat, out of shape and either very ill or still unrecovered from his old groin injury. It is pitiable that he thinks he's John Wayne and should keep working through his obvious misery.Yes, there is Seagal himself doing some looping, which always happens to everyone...noise in the background, someone drops a toolbox, otherwise good take. You have to economize. Why are so many scenes with Seagal in close-up so painfully dubbed by someone else? I think it is because Seagal loses his voice from time to time.His physical condition explains the idiotic stunt double he uses, and also the ""cheat shots"" during fight close-ups. If you look at this film, Seagal is really only performing beginning and ending techniques--not any movement in between. In one scene, his back to the camera, he (or his double) just stands there while the bad guy flies!What I want desperately to know is why does Seagal insist on ""talking black"", as if he were a native of Louisiana? It is annoying as hell, he doesn't need to do it at all, and as if that weren't enough, the accent disappears for most of the film only to return full force at the end. Now what gives with the phony accent?Secondly, while I appreciated SO much Seagal's elimination of his eternally ugly ponytail, why is he wearing such a lousy, Dracula-like hairpiece? We all know his hairline's gone the way of the dodo. So has Seagal, apparently, but heck, if Wayne could do it, well....I've watched Seagal's first film, ""Above the Law"", which he did when he was 36, and his hairline was literally receding as filming progressed. By the time he did ""Under Siege"" he had on a toupee. He has since graduated to a wig.Now, this fella, who I suspect is completely bald up top, has been able to get away with the rug only for so long...he's not Sean Connery, who bared his pate to the public a lot earlier than John Wayne finally did. Seagal isn't even up to the standards of Jack Klugman, who was as bald as an egg yet everyone thought he had a gorgeous head of hair. Same with Seagal; now he's being scrutinized by an unfriendly new generation and they see an ugly, fat old man with a REALLY bad wig. Is he getting away with it? Or just making himself look foolish?This film indeed has a promising storyline, which is unfulfilled: the worst kind. Seagal plays an understandably pissed-off dude. His criminal actions are easily explained in this way. A falsely imprisoned special forces agent finally gets out...shades of Connery's ""The Rock"". Yet Seagal is also taking his typical ""I'm-dead-inside"" hell-bent-for-leather total destruction attitude.I thought this man was supposed to be a reincarnated lama!!What little I love about this film is its commentary on the modern Chinese government and refugees therefrom. Good point that was sadly and stupidly underplayed here. Seagal was loved from the first because of his films' deep political messages. Those are now pathetic memories past.Seagal fans, support him and let his transgressions pass...but don't buy this piece of garbage. Seagal needs to know one thing: he must stop insulting his fans. If he's going to be fat, bald, old, ugly and sick, so be it! Wayne managed it, though he never appeared bald in a film. Connery did at least one film I know with his head au naturale. Seagal needs to truly touch his inner core and understand that people loved him for his message, his talents, and not for his crummy wigs and silly accents.",2,"Ai Ki Do master, heal thyself, NOW!!",1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,4210,"['top', 'review', 'here', 'excellent', 'insightful', 'Pity', 'film', 'one', 'WORST', 'Seagal', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'endure', 'One', 'favorite', 'bad', 'films', 'Belly', 'Beast', '2003', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'flaws', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'overall', 'structure', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'took', 'great', 'deal', 'away', 'Seagal', 'remake', 'film', 'Taken', '2008', '.What', 'obsession', 'Beast', 'Well', 'Seagal', 'oddities', 'full', 'view', 'However', 'may', 'be', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Dangerous', 'Mess', 'Cinematic', 'Blunders', 'reviewer', 'who', 'so', 'eloquently', 'reviews', 'asked', 'question', 'why', 'Seagal', 'getting', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'someone', 'else', 'Let', 'address', 'viewer', 'what', 'think', 'been', 'going', 'Seagal', 'think', 'old', 'fat', 'shape', 'very', 'ill', 'still', 'unrecovered', 'old', 'groin', 'injury', 'pitiable', 'John', 'Wayne', 'should', 'keep', 'working', 'obvious', 'misery.Yes', 'Seagal', 'doing', 'looping', 'always', 'everyone', 'noise', 'background', 'someone', 'toolbox', 'otherwise', 'good', 'take', 'have', 'economize', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'Seagal', 'close-up', 'so', 'painfully', 'dubbed', 'someone', 'else', 'think', 'Seagal', 'voice', 'time', 'time.His', 'physical', 'condition', 'idiotic', 'stunt', 'double', 'also', 'cheat', 'shots', 'fight', 'close-ups', 'look', 'film', 'Seagal', 'really', 'only', 'performing', 'beginning', 'ending', 'techniques', 'not', 'movement', 'one', 'scene', 'back', 'camera', 'double', 'just', 'bad', 'guy', 'flies', 'What', 'want', 'desperately', 'know', 'why', 'Seagal', 'insist', 'talking', 'black', 'were', 'native', 'Louisiana', 'annoying', 'as', 'hell', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'accent', 'most', 'film', 'only', 'return', 'full', 'force', 'end', 'Now', 'what', 'phony', 'accent', 'Secondly', 'appreciated', 'SO', 'much', 'Seagal', 'elimination', 'eternally', 'ugly', 'ponytail', 'why', 'wearing', 'such', 'lousy', 'Dracula-like', 'hairpiece', 'know', 'hairline', 'gone', 'way', 'dodo', 'So', 'Seagal', 'apparently', 'heck', 'Wayne', 'could', 'do', 'well', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Seagal', 'first', 'film', 'Law', 'did', 'when', 'was', '36', 'hairline', 'was', 'literally', 'receding', 'filming', 'progressed', 'time', 'did', 'Siege', 'had', 'toupee', 'graduated', 'wig.Now', 'fella', 'who', 'suspect', 'completely', 'bald', 'up', 'top', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'rug', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'not', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'who', 'bared', 'pate', 'public', 'lot', 'earlier', 'John', 'Wayne', 'finally', 'did', 'Seagal', ""n't"", 'even', 'up', 'standards', 'Jack', 'Klugman', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'bald', 'egg', 'yet', 'everyone', 'thought', 'had', 'gorgeous', 'head', 'hair', 'Same', 'Seagal', 'now', 'being', 'scrutinized', 'unfriendly', 'new', 'generation', 'see', 'ugly', 'fat', 'old', 'man', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'wig', 'getting', 'away', 'just', 'making', 'look', 'foolish', 'film', 'indeed', 'promising', 'storyline', 'unfulfilled', 'worst', 'kind', 'Seagal', 'understandably', 'pissed-off', 'dude', 'criminal', 'actions', 'are', 'easily', 'explained', 'way', 'falsely', 'imprisoned', 'special', 'forces', 'agent', 'finally', 'out', 'shades', 'Connery', 'Rock', 'Seagal', 'also', 'taking', 'typical', ""I'm-dead-inside"", 'hell-bent-for-leather', 'total', 'destruction', 'attitude.I', 'thought', 'man', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'reincarnated', 'lama', 'What', 'little', 'love', 'film', 'commentary', 'modern', 'Chinese', 'government', 'refugees', 'therefrom', 'Good', 'point', 'was', 'sadly', 'stupidly', 'underplayed', 'here', 'Seagal', 'was', 'loved', 'first', 'films', 'deep', 'political', 'messages', 'are', 'now', 'pathetic', 'memories', 'past.Seagal', 'fans', 'support', 'let', 'transgressions', 'pass', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'piece', 'garbage', 'Seagal', 'know', 'one', 'thing', 'must', 'stop', 'insulting', 'fans', 'going', 'be', 'fat', 'bald', 'old', 'ugly', 'sick', 'so', 'be', 'Wayne', 'managed', 'never', 'appeared', 'bald', 'film', 'Connery', 'did', 'least', 'one', 'film', 'know', 'head', 'naturale', 'Seagal', 'truly', 'touch', 'inner', 'core', 'understand', 'people', 'loved', 'message', 'talents', 'not', 'crummy', 'wigs', 'silly', 'accents']",N/A

1315368,ADE00OPL4KPWK,B0030E5PWQ,Maladjusted,"[3, 4]","Churning out more movies in 6 months than Hollywooddoes in a year, Seagal still hasn't shown any signsof slowing down despite nearly collecting retirement.Since Above the Law audiences have been enthralledby the numerous ways in which a human body can be twisted,snapped, thrown, pummeled, cut, burned, impaled, shot andblown to smithereens. And ol' Steven continues to deliverthat need with a cinematic body count rivaling that of asmall country.However, over the years viewers have been baffled bythe parody of the 6'4"" Aikido star.Uncertain to fans:1. The gross overuse of poor voice-overs. Also, Steven'smysterious use of accents ranging from a jive-talkin'brotha, to a Louisianan bumpkin. Is it mockery or simplytrying to fit in with the natives?2. Seagal's stand-in's that poorly resemble him; usuallyshorter, half his weight and with real hair.3. How the lapsed time can sometimes feel like more thandouble or even triple the film's actual running time.And still we commit time to his films in desperate hopefor a quick glimpse of films decades past.Now, advice for future Seagal DTV bad guys:1. Never, under any circumstance hold a pistol a foot awayfrom Steven's face. This generally results in being quicklydisarmed in an array of hyper-edited fight shots resultingin a disc seperating neck chop by a hand big enough tograsp 3/4 of a basketball, or having your nuts kicked intoyour upper abdominal area and rendered useless (Seagal isa one man army for population control).2. When you run completely out of ammo, flee. DO NOT byany means attempt hand-to-hand combat, especially when youare usually half the man's height and weight and plan tohave children. You might be half his age, and he's usuallystanding immobile, but the man's arms can move quicker thanlightning. The unfortunate saps that try typically end up pinnedagainst a wall, bombarded by flailing arms and then thrown intoevery piece of nearby furniture (always done in hyper-editingmode).3. Never explain your nefarious deeds while standing 3 feetaway from said bone-breaker/nut-pulverizer, especially whenholding a pistol a foot away from his face while standingin a room full of furniture.4. Never make Steven look bad on the set, as it couldresult in aforementioned injuries (i.e. leave your confidenceand arrogance at the door).Advice to producers of the next imminent DTV release:Please, do not put Steven in any further scenes involvingsex or the possibility of it.

1315369,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B0030E5PWQ,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[4, 9]","Seagal fans, the streak is over. So good wereUrban JusticeandPistol Whippedthat I was willing to letKill SwitchandAgainst the Darkpass as flukes, and at the time, I was rewarded with the better-than-averageDriven to Kill.The Keeper, the first of two collaborations between Steven and director Keoni Waxman, barely passed as acceptable in my book, and now, ""A Dangerous Man"" confirms my growing suspicions that Seagal's past DTV disasters have less to do with the whims of the company he's affiliated with (then Sony, now 20th Century Fox) and more with the competency of the director handling him. You wouldn't believe by looking at this film that it wasn't made five years ago in the midst of Seagal's unpopular period, but sure enough, this one's repeats all of the past's ugly mistakes for the new decade.The story: after serving six years in prison for a crime he didn't commit (it's never resolved who did), ex-Special Forces member Shane Daniels (Seagal) is released and promptly caught up in a deadly triangle between Chinese warlords, the Russian mafia, and corrupt local police about a kidnapped girl (Marlaina Mah) and a bag of drug money. Promised a way out of the country by a mafioso boss whose son he rescued (Jesse Hutch, ""About a Girl""), Shane must upset the plot of a vicious Chinese colonel (Byron Mann) if he hopes to leave with his life.Believe it or not, the movie starts promisingly: sure, there's some unnecessary post-production editing already apparent, but the first two minutes nevertheless feature Steven supplying his own voiceover for a cell phone conversation and sporting one of his trademark funny jackets. An additional two minutes later, however, everything goes to hell by way of an overkill of obvious dubbing, poorly-disguised stand-ins, and the same quick-cut fight scenes that helped spell death for many of Seagal's previous DTV ventures. Yet another two minutes later, it's back to looking promising. For this recurring flip-floppery, ""A Dangerous Man"" is easily one of the most confounding of Steven's movies. It raises the questions why Seagal can do voiceovers for things as insignificant as phone calls but then require someone to match lines to his lips while he's speaking in clear sight, and why it was necessary to resort to stunt doubles and annoying camera angles when we get to see him execute several brilliant aikido moves on his own throughout the film. Honestly, what gives?To its credit, the plotline doesn't share the convolution of the production methods and is easy to follow - always a plus for Seagalian fare. The acting is decent, with Terry Chen (They Wait) and Jerry Wasserman (The Entrance) adding a strong supporting base of bad guys to the leads. Mob man Vitaly Kravchenko actually steals the show at one point by playing the intimidation game on dirty cop Wasserman better than Steven Seagal ever could. However, neither of these unexpected plusses can match the disappointment of Seagal reverting back to his old film formula for the worse. I was particularly disappointed by the one-sidedness of the eventual Seagal-Byron Mann encounter: seeing as their previous collaboration was in the thoroughly awesomeBelly of the Beast, I hoped that some of that style would rub off and make their first mano-e-mano fight something out of the ordinary, but no such luck. There's a bit more action in here than in his previous film, but Steven displays little variation as he dismantles everybody who crosses him in the same brutal-yet-mundane fashion.By now, the film's short bursts of competency have been overshadowed by the long lags of damning post-production editing and Seagal feeding his ego by having every other character figuratively kiss his butt in one way or another. It's really beyond me why so many of these low-budget filmmakers think it necessary to fill their fare with all of these pointless, attention-calling artificialities, but the point's moot by now - this movie has been ruined. Seagal, please try to find another Don Fauntleroy or Roel Reine to work with - leave the over-indulgent Keoni Waxmans of the world beneath you.",2,"""He threatened my balls""",1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,4110,"['Seagal', 'fans', 'streak', 'over', 'So', 'good', 'wereUrban', 'JusticeandPistol', 'Whippedthat', 'was', 'willing', 'letKill', 'SwitchandAgainst', 'Darkpass', 'flukes', 'time', 'was', 'rewarded', 'better-than-averageDriven', 'Kill.The', 'Keeper', 'first', 'two', 'collaborations', 'Steven', 'director', 'Keoni', 'Waxman', 'barely', 'passed', 'acceptable', 'book', 'now', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'confirms', 'growing', 'suspicions', 'Seagal', 'past', 'DTV', 'disasters', 'have', 'less', 'do', 'whims', 'company', 'affiliated', 'then', 'Sony', 'now', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'more', 'competency', 'director', 'handling', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'looking', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'midst', 'Seagal', 'unpopular', 'period', 'sure', 'enough', 'one', 'repeats', 'past', 'ugly', 'mistakes', 'new', 'decade.The', 'story', 'serving', 'six', 'years', 'prison', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'never', 'resolved', 'who', 'did', 'ex-Special', 'Forces', 'member', 'Shane', 'Daniels', 'Seagal', 'released', 'promptly', 'caught', 'up', 'deadly', 'triangle', 'Chinese', 'warlords', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'corrupt', 'local', 'police', 'kidnapped', 'girl', 'Marlaina', 'Mah', 'bag', 'drug', 'money', 'Promised', 'way', 'country', 'mafioso', 'boss', 'son', 'rescued', 'Jesse', 'Hutch', 'Girl', 'Shane', 'must', 'upset', 'plot', 'vicious', 'Chinese', 'colonel', 'Byron', 'Mann', 'leave', 'life.Believe', 'not', 'movie', 'promisingly', 'sure', 'unnecessary', 'post-production', 'editing', 'already', 'apparent', 'first', 'two', 'minutes', 'nevertheless', 'feature', 'Steven', 'supplying', 'own', 'voiceover', 'cell', 'phone', 'conversation', 'sporting', 'one', 'trademark', 'funny', 'jackets', 'additional', 'two', 'minutes', 'later', 'however', 'everything', 'hell', 'way', 'overkill', 'obvious', 'dubbing', 'poorly-disguised', 'stand-ins', 'same', 'quick-cut', 'fight', 'scenes', 'helped', 'spell', 'death', 'many', 'Seagal', 'previous', 'DTV', 'ventures', 'two', 'minutes', 'later', 'back', 'looking', 'promising', 'recurring', 'flip-floppery', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'confounding', 'Steven', 'movies', 'questions', 'why', 'Seagal', 'can', 'do', 'voiceovers', 'things', 'as', 'insignificant', 'phone', 'calls', 'then', 'require', 'someone', 'match', 'lines', 'lips', 'speaking', 'clear', 'sight', 'why', 'was', 'necessary', 'resort', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'annoying', 'camera', 'angles', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'execute', 'several', 'brilliant', 'aikido', 'moves', 'own', 'film', 'Honestly', 'what', 'credit', 'plotline', ""n't"", 'share', 'convolution', 'production', 'methods', 'easy', 'follow', 'always', 'plus', 'Seagalian', 'fare', 'acting', 'decent', 'Terry', 'Chen', 'Wait', 'Jerry', 'Wasserman', 'Entrance', 'adding', 'strong', 'supporting', 'base', 'bad', 'guys', 'leads', 'Mob', 'man', 'Vitaly', 'Kravchenko', 'actually', 'show', 'one', 'point', 'playing', 'intimidation', 'game', 'dirty', 'cop', 'Wasserman', 'better', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'ever', 'could', 'However', 'unexpected', 'plusses', 'can', 'match', 'disappointment', 'Seagal', 'reverting', 'back', 'old', 'film', 'formula', 'worse', 'was', 'particularly', 'disappointed', 'one-sidedness', 'eventual', 'Seagal-Byron', 'Mann', 'encounter', 'seeing', 'previous', 'collaboration', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'awesomeBelly', 'Beast', 'hoped', 'style', 'would', 'rub', 'off', 'make', 'first', 'mano-e-mano', 'fight', 'something', 'ordinary', 'such', 'luck', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'here', 'previous', 'film', 'Steven', 'little', 'variation', 'everybody', 'who', 'same', 'brutal-yet-mundane', 'fashion.By', 'now', 'film', 'short', 'bursts', 'competency', 'have', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'long', 'lags', 'damning', 'post-production', 'editing', 'Seagal', 'feeding', 'ego', 'having', 'other', 'character', 'figuratively', 'kiss', 'butt', 'one', 'way', 'really', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'low-budget', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'necessary', 'fill', 'fare', 'pointless', 'attention-calling', 'artificialities', 'point', 'moot', 'now', 'movie', 'been', 'ruined', 'Seagal', 'please', 'try', 'find', 'Don', 'Fauntleroy', 'Roel', 'Reine', 'work', 'leave', 'over-indulgent', 'Keoni', 'Waxmans', 'world', 'beneath']",N/A

I think it's because there is that occasional Seagull (no I didn't misspell it, that's my moniker for him now) movie that for some reason I like. The aforementioned ""Flight of Fury"" and I liked ""Pistol Whipped"" (2008) as well. ""The Keeper"" (2009) and ""Driven to Kill"" (2009) were pretty well-made movies, but I personally didn't care for them. The bad news for this film is that it is even worse than those others. I had high hopes at the outset of the film - the camera work looked pretty nice and though the story set-up was your usual cliche that Seagull was wrongly accused and incarcerated and now he's back out of prison to, to do what exactly? Well, we don't know because the story didn't tell us what he's doing now. I guess he's a former good guy that is now hardened by his prison experience, how original.I thought the film was much more brutal than any of his other movies. Not as dark as ""Against the Dark"" (2009) but that was a horror film, so it was expected. As another reviewer said, this film was more like Seagull was a punk, brutally beating people with little rhyme or reason. And there was just too much obvious stunt double work, and dubbed voice overs and mumbling. Plus, what is it with this Russian mobster theme as of late - it's getting tired real fast. I guess he has a lot of fans in that part of the world. Plus they missed a real opportunity here to have his cute 20-something rescuee get naked. That would have helped a pretty lame and unoriginal story - bad cops, Russian mobsters, Chinese mobsters, e...i...e...i...OAnd that final scene which was all of about 30 seconds with him in some mansion estate in some foreign land with his hot 20-something girlie girl - well, it made me laugh so it wasn't all bad.

Back on the street, he comes to the rescue of a beautiful young hostage stashed in a car trunk with millions in cash. Wielding a devastating combination of street fighting smarts and martial arts skills, he suddenly finds himself in a deadly showdown with international drug merchants and the local corrupt cops. As the only ones standing between him and his new found freedom, they're about to discover just how dangerous one man can be in this explosive, wall-to-wall thriller.The prosLots of action. You get gunfights,hand to hand combat and even some real brutal scenes with him messing somebody up ugly. You get a number of hot chicks in it as well,some even got naked. A solid story line for an action film of this type. Seagal is convincing in this type of role. I was never a big fan of his,but I liked this film. Sometimes it's good to watch a basic action film with butt kicking and not much else. Like a guilty pleasure. The acting won't win any awards,but it wasn't bad for a lower budget film like this. I've seen many of these types of films with much worse acting than this. It's nice that he touched upon people getting put in jail on circumstantial evidence in our societyThe consHe may be good at action,but his acting could use some more effort. One scene has him being rode by a naked hot white chick and he sits there stone faced. I had a issue with the camera angles during the fights. It was jumping around at different angles so much I couldn't tell what was going on. I really wish some of these directors would stop trying to get fancy with this stuff. The story was decent,but I wish somebody would try and put a good story in an action film. I find myself not being as interested in films like this as I get older. You can have a good story and tons of action. I felt the island did it fairly well. I like seagal,but this super man things were he never gets hit much in his films is boring to me. Even BRUCE Lee took some lumps in his films. It's more interesting to see a guy have at least one match in the film who can give him some go. Some might have a problem with the level of violence in the film. He does get down and dirty in this film. Also there are brief scenes of nudity and some profanity in the film. Some parents may not want their teenagers watching this. I kind of hated that they didn't explore the subject of people getting forced into prison and the bad arrest that our criminal justice system makes. It would have made this picture much better to have focused on that a bit more. Also they could have developed the relationship with him and his wife a bit more. It would have helped me to feel his pain a bit more when he went to jail and lost every thing. Also why no scenes of him actually being in jail? Lets reinforce and show his suffering a bit more. Silly me though because that would have taken away from his time beating people upthe conclusionA solid action film worth watching. It's not a great film,but you could do a lot worse. Sometimes it's nice sit around and watch a film like this that's not really about any thing,but people getting messed up ugly.

1315379,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0030E5PWQ,Sid the Elf,"[18, 21]","Over the past few years Steven Seagal has become more of a walking punchline then the renowned action powerhouse he used to be known as. His movie had hit the bottom of the barrel in a way you could barely get through the entire thing without a finger on the fast forward button. However our beloved Seagal is showing signs of greatness yet again as he appears to be pulling a 180 in the a-- kicking department. Where we last left him was with his filmThe Keeperwhere we got a taste of a supremely entertaining entry and thought it to be more of a fluke, but were proven very wrong. Hey we're not ashamed to admit it, even we make mistakes from time to time. A Dangerous Man (aka A Nice Mix) is definitive proof that Seagal still has a little something left under his sleeve. Not to mention a new catch phrase with the term ""F--- you up ugly"" which he utters a couple times as a warning before he has to take you down.In A Dangerous Man Seagal plays an empty soul Shane Daniels who was just released from prison. The reason for his inner anger is due to the fact he served 6 years for a crime he didn't commit with nothing more then an apology from the State. He lost his wife and everything that mattered in his life long ago. Once free he happens to witness a cop murdered by the Chinese Mafia and decides to intervene. After finding a bag of drug money along with a kidnapped girl he decides to make this matter his business in old school Seagal a-- kicking fashion. He finds that the kidnapped girl has an uncle that was captured, and with a helping hand from the Russian mafia, makes it his mission to dismantle the Chinese Mafia one eggroll at a time.This movie right here has restored all faith in the fact Seagal has so many more great years of action packed potential to offer. Sure anything he will ever do for the rest of time will be a straight to video release, but that makes it even more appetizing for us. It keeps it in that realm of B action (which we live for) while simultaneously being a legit great movie. From the opening scene this one has us captivated all the way through with barely any lulls. There was a short stint here or there that slowed the pace down a little, but not nearly enough to take anything positive away. We now have no choice but to eagerly await his next release which will most likely be in another month or two. So kudos to you Steven on a job.....done.",5,"""It means your mama won't be able to recognize you in your coffin""-actual Seagal quote",1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,2401,"['past', 'few', 'years', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'become', 'more', 'walking', 'punchline', 'then', 'renowned', 'action', 'used', 'be', 'known', 'movie', 'had', 'hit', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'way', 'could', 'barely', 'get', 'entire', 'thing', 'finger', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'However', 'beloved', 'Seagal', 'showing', 'signs', 'greatness', 'yet', 'again', 'be', 'pulling', '180', 'kicking', 'department', 'Where', 'last', 'left', 'was', 'filmThe', 'Keeperwhere', 'got', 'taste', 'supremely', 'entertaining', 'entry', 'thought', 'be', 'more', 'fluke', 'were', 'proven', 'very', 'wrong', 'Hey', ""'re"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'even', 'make', 'mistakes', 'time', 'time', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'aka', 'A', 'Nice', 'Mix', 'definitive', 'proof', 'Seagal', 'still', 'little', 'something', 'left', 'sleeve', 'Not', 'mention', 'new', 'catch', 'phrase', 'term', 'F', 'up', 'ugly', 'couple', 'times', 'warning', 'take', 'down.In', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'Seagal', 'empty', 'soul', 'Shane', 'Daniels', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'prison', 'reason', 'inner', 'anger', 'due', 'fact', 'served', '6', 'years', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'apology', 'State', 'lost', 'wife', 'everything', 'mattered', 'life', 'long', 'ago', 'Once', 'free', 'witness', 'cop', 'murdered', 'Chinese', 'Mafia', 'intervene', 'finding', 'bag', 'drug', 'money', 'kidnapped', 'girl', 'make', 'matter', 'business', 'old', 'school', 'Seagal', 'kicking', 'fashion', 'kidnapped', 'girl', 'uncle', 'was', 'captured', 'helping', 'hand', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'mission', 'dismantle', 'Chinese', 'Mafia', 'one', 'eggroll', 'time.This', 'movie', 'right', 'here', 'restored', 'faith', 'fact', 'Seagal', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'years', 'action', 'packed', 'potential', 'offer', 'Sure', 'anything', 'will', 'ever', 'do', 'rest', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'straight', 'video', 'release', 'even', 'more', 'appetizing', 'realm', 'B', 'action', 'live', 'simultaneously', 'being', 'legit', 'great', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'one', 'captivated', 'way', 'barely', 'lulls', 'was', 'short', 'stint', 'here', 'there', 'slowed', 'pace', 'down', 'little', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'take', 'anything', 'positive', 'away', 'now', 'have', 'choice', 'eagerly', 'await', 'next', 'release', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'month', 'two', 'So', 'kudos', 'Steven', 'job', '..done']",N/A

1315381,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0030E5PWQ,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","Steven Seagal's new movie ""A Dangerous Man"" is directed by Keoni Waxman, the same director responsible for the so-so action ""The Keeper."" To me the former is no better or no worse than the latter. The differences are ""A Dangerous Man"" has a more complicated (or confusing) storyline involving Chinese and Russians, and also supporting actors including Byron Mann, previously seen in Seagal's ""Belly of the Beast"" in 2003.In ""A Dangerous Man"" Steven Seagal is Shane Daniels, an ex-military special agent who was wrongly convicted for murder. After six years in prison he is finally released, but his wife has already left him. Then while drinking in a parking lot, Shane saves the life of a young car thief Sergey (Jesse Hutch) and a kidnapped woman named Tia (Marlaina Mah). And Shane gets a bag full of cash. Maybe we should forget the muddled story. In short, Seagal's is a hero, ""a good guy"" who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.As a low-budget film, actions of ""A Dangerous Man"" are just average. Keoni Waxman seems to prefer murky photography in shooting his films, so most of the film's actions take place during the night, and sometimes it is hard to tell who is shooting who. As to Seagal's martial arts action, it is the same as in ""The Keeper,"" which means nothing special.The most disappointing thing about ""A Dangerous Man"" is that Byron Mann's character, a baddie called ""The Colonel."" As you know, underrated Byron Mann can really act and do actions, but here he is not allowed to show what he can do. Not a single moment. But maybe we shouldn't complain. Had he given a chance to do so, the film would have had a different ending.",2,"(2.5 STARS) No Better or No Worse Than ""The Keeper""",1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,1663,"['Steven', 'Seagal', 'new', 'movie', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'directed', 'Keoni', 'Waxman', 'same', 'director', 'responsible', 'so-so', 'action', 'Keeper', 'former', 'better', 'worse', 'latter', 'differences', 'are', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'more', 'complicated', 'confusing', 'storyline', 'involving', 'Chinese', 'Russians', 'also', 'supporting', 'actors', 'including', 'Byron', 'Mann', 'previously', 'seen', 'Seagal', 'Belly', 'Beast', '2003.In', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Shane', 'Daniels', 'ex-military', 'special', 'agent', 'who', 'was', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'murder', 'six', 'years', 'prison', 'finally', 'released', 'wife', 'already', 'left', 'Then', 'drinking', 'parking', 'lot', 'Shane', 'life', 'young', 'car', 'thief', 'Sergey', 'Jesse', 'Hutch', 'kidnapped', 'woman', 'named', 'Tia', 'Marlaina', 'Mah', 'Shane', 'bag', 'full', 'cash', 'Maybe', 'should', 'forget', 'muddled', 'story', 'short', 'Seagal', 'hero', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time.As', 'low-budget', 'film', 'actions', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'are', 'just', 'average', 'Keoni', 'Waxman', 'prefer', 'murky', 'photography', 'shooting', 'films', 'most', 'film', 'actions', 'take', 'place', 'night', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'tell', 'who', 'shooting', 'who', 'Seagal', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'same', 'Keeper', 'nothing', 'special.The', 'most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'Byron', 'Mann', 'character', 'baddie', 'called', 'Colonel', 'know', 'underrated', 'Byron', 'Mann', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'do', 'actions', 'here', 'not', 'allowed', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Not', 'single', 'moment', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'complain', 'Had', 'given', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'different', 'ending']",N/A

All of the supporting roles are performed so well you become willing to overlook the mediocre plot or the fact Seagal doesn't appear much in the middle of the film.  While his dialogue is heavily dubbed in the beginning of the movie, they finally found a voice actor so good you almost can't tell the difference, and the occasional body double appears but is not as blatantly apparent as in most other films comprising the Seagal DTV canon.  The single aspect of the film which deserves genuine criticism is the fighting, as most fight scenes were sped up in post production to the point of being comical.  The fighting is what we pay to see and should receive the most attention to detail.  The Keeper is another recent release which rates just as highly, but none of the Seagal DTV era compares with Urban Justice.
