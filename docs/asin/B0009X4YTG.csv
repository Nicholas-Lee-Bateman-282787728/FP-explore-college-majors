Things that shouldn't make sense in any normal way shows that ""normalcy"" can be a byproduct of the surreal. Scientific projects gone entirely awry, and others that were successful (for a time being), and others that I've read documented proof on some of the stuff on this show, including the mysterious object known only as ""The Bell"" and how it had permanently disappeared, seemingly, from existence. And, though I already knew about a mysterious object falling over Russia and exploding before touching the ground, I never thought it could've been connected to Nikola Tesla.

He does a good job of narrating this 'short story' format of scientific discoveries. These are quirky little blurbs more than anything else - from what really happened to Einstein's brain to Missing Cosmonauts - did the Russians really send humans into space; humans who died in space?These are indeed more 'short stories' than anything else, but the series was interesting, and led me to look up some of the rather esoteric stories to gain more knowledge on the subject.

I suspected this would be something closely aligned to shows like 'Ancient Aliens', wherein junk science is praised and observable reality is rarely confronted. In some places, this show lives up to that expected standard. But, for the most part, Dark Matters succeeds in shedding light on some of the more wacky chapters of scientific history. If you can get past the pieces which are lacking, then this is nothing but a fun experience. You would be hard pressed to call it educational; as certain stories (such as the one equating the Tunguska event to Tesla, when a perfectly reasonable resolve for the event exists) are purposely cheating viewers of the most plausible explanations. Like I said though, immensely entertaining.
