744160,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00008KDGZ,Amanda,"[0, 1]","Romantic &quot;chick flicks&quot; are a dime a dozen these days, but only a few of them are worth even mentioning. This, surprisingly, is one of them. Kate Hudson is adorable as Andie Anderson - the author of a monthly &quot;How to...&quot; guide in Composure magazine. While she wants to be a serious reporter covering such things as politics, her boss just wants her to cover fluff on losing weight, fashion, dating, etc. So she gives in once again, and decides to write an anti-dating article, entitled &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; - in other words, be as annoying as you can to the guy you're dating until he dumps you. Meanwhile, Matthew McConaughey's character, Ben, has made a bet that he can make Andie fall in love with him in 10 days (he, of course, knows nothing about her little scheme, and vice versa). What ensues is a silly movie, but sweet and often funny.Like I said before, there are so many romantic comedies out there that are dull and unemotional. Recent movies, such as 'Maid in Manhattan', try so hard to be funny, sweet and tear-jerking at the same time, but fail. But not this one. I actually found myself rooting for the two main characters - both of whom I really liked. Kate Hudson does an incredible job going from the slightly psychotic Andie to the fun and sane Andie, and Matthew McConaughy makes great chick flick material (which we found out in 'The Wedding Planner' - if only it had been a better movie). 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' has quickly moved on to my list of favorite romantic comedies. And guess what, girls? You can probably even get your boyfriends to watch it with you. I watched it with my boyfriend (who does not consider himself a fan of the chick flick genre), and he seemed to enjoy it as well. I highly recommend it.",5,Undeniably Cute.

744163,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00008KDGZ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I think what makes me just love `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is none other than Kate Hudson.  Her performance is just so hilariously charming it's almost impossible not to fall in love with her here.  I say almost because I've read a few reviews that suggest the other alternative.  To me though, while the film is clich&eacute;d, it still manages to rise above the majority of romantic comedies today with a surprisingly warm performance by Hudson and an even more surprisingly charming performance by McConaughey.  I think it would be safe to say that Matthew general fails to really impress me.  I just don't see the hype behind his good looks.  Sure he's got a body but aside from that he's void of any real qualities that help him stand out and embrace the audience.  He's like Paul Walker to me.  Not really an ounce of acting ability but a charming smile and good hair.  Here though, and maybe it's just Hudson creating the perfect atmosphere, but he seems to be a little more in control of his scenes and comfortable in his skin.  I actually believed he was a living breathing person and not a manikin with a smile.The film centers around two people needing to prove something.  First there's Andie Anderson, a beautiful journalist for a woman's fashion magazine who just wants her shot at writing the articles that intrigue her.  Basically she wants to break away from shoes and write about war.  In order to get her chance she has to write an article on the dating don'ts, the mistakes women make in relationships, namely, how to lose a guy in ten days.  In order to do this she has to find a man, make him love her and then drive him away chronicling the entire experience for her article.  Then we have Ben, an advertising exec who wants to break into the diamond market.  In order to win the opportunity to pitch a campaign to a wealthy diamond exporter he has to prove his undeniable charm by getting a woman to fall in love with him.  The woman that is chosen is Andie.  So Ben needs to attain Andie's love all the while Andie needs to drive Ben away and if either fails then they lose all that they are trying so hard to attain.Of course we all know that in the end they fall in love, but getting there is a lot of fun.  As charming as Matthew is as Ben its Hudson's Andie that steals the show.  Even in her insanity she is irresistible.  Not only is she a knock out (so beautiful) but she knows how to accentuate her greatest asset, her personality.  Kate Hudson is larger than life here and she perfectly switches between charming aspiring journalist to charming crazed lunatic.  Her comedic timing is great here.  Whether she's going bananas over photo-shopped pictures of her family with Ben or swooning over her secret crush while he works a room full of diamond buyers, Hudson is on top of her game.  You can definitely see her mother in her eyes and that's a good thing, a very good thing.  Sadly Kate has moved on to duller comedies instead of embracing her talent with more suitable work.  Some have mentioned that this was the beginning of the end of her career, but I like to think of this as her last great effort.  Sure, it's no `Almost Famous', and dear god I hope one day she returns to those glory days, but it's still a great romantic comedy that fits it's leading lady about as well as that yellow dress (when you see the movie you'll know the one).",4,"Charming and playful, a film that serves up the goods...",1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,3385,"['think', 'what', 'just', 'love', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'none', 'other', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'performance', 'just', 'so', 'hilariously', 'charming', 'almost', 'impossible', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'here', 'say', 'almost', ""'ve"", 'read', 'few', 'reviews', 'suggest', 'other', 'alternative', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'still', 'rise', 'majority', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'today', 'surprisingly', 'warm', 'performance', 'Hudson', 'even', 'more', 'surprisingly', 'charming', 'performance', 'McConaughey', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'safe', 'say', 'Matthew', 'general', 'fails', 'really', 'impress', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'hype', 'good', 'looks', 'Sure', 'got', 'body', 'aside', 'void', 'real', 'qualities', 'help', 'stand', 'out', 'embrace', 'audience', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Not', 'really', 'ounce', 'acting', 'ability', 'charming', 'smile', 'good', 'hair', 'Here', 'maybe', 'just', 'Hudson', 'creating', 'perfect', 'atmosphere', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'control', 'scenes', 'comfortable', 'skin', 'actually', 'believed', 'was', 'living', 'breathing', 'person', 'not', 'manikin', 'smile.The', 'film', 'centers', 'two', 'people', 'needing', 'prove', 'something', 'First', 'Andie', 'Anderson', 'beautiful', 'journalist', 'woman', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'who', 'just', 'shot', 'writing', 'articles', 'intrigue', 'Basically', 'break', 'away', 'shoes', 'write', 'war', 'order', 'get', 'chance', 'write', 'article', 'dating', ""don'ts"", 'mistakes', 'women', 'make', 'relationships', 'namely', 'how', 'lose', 'guy', 'ten', 'days', 'order', 'do', 'find', 'man', 'make', 'love', 'then', 'drive', 'away', 'chronicling', 'entire', 'experience', 'article', 'Then', 'have', 'Ben', 'advertising', 'exec', 'who', 'break', 'diamond', 'market', 'order', 'win', 'opportunity', 'pitch', 'campaign', 'wealthy', 'diamond', 'exporter', 'prove', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'getting', 'woman', 'fall', 'love', 'woman', 'chosen', 'Andie', 'So', 'Ben', 'attain', 'Andie', 'love', 'while', 'Andie', 'drive', 'Ben', 'away', 'fails', 'then', 'lose', 'are', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'attain.Of', 'course', 'know', 'end', 'fall', 'love', 'getting', 'lot', 'fun', 'As', 'charming', 'Matthew', 'Ben', 'Hudson', 'Andie', 'show', 'Even', 'insanity', 'irresistible', 'Not', 'only', 'knock', 'out', 'so', 'beautiful', 'how', 'accentuate', 'greatest', 'asset', 'personality', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'larger', 'life', 'here', 'perfectly', 'charming', 'aspiring', 'journalist', 'charming', 'crazed', 'lunatic', 'comedic', 'timing', 'great', 'here', 'Whether', 'going', 'bananas', 'photo-shopped', 'pictures', 'family', 'Ben', 'swooning', 'secret', 'crush', 'room', 'full', 'diamond', 'buyers', 'Hudson', 'top', 'game', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'mother', 'eyes', 'good', 'thing', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'Sadly', 'Kate', 'moved', 'duller', 'comedies', 'instead', 'embracing', 'talent', 'more', 'suitable', 'work', 'have', 'mentioned', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'career', 'like', 'think', 'last', 'great', 'effort', 'Sure', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'dear', 'god', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'glory', 'days', 'still', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'leading', 'lady', 'as', 'well', 'yellow', 'dress', 'when', 'see', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'know', 'one']",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

There's Andie (played perfectly by the adorable and lovable Kate Hudson) who is a writer for a fashion magazine. Then there's Ben (played by Matthew McConaughey-the part could not have went to a better male lead!) who's in advertising.So as to not to give too much away there's two different bets going on from both parties. Andie's is to how to lose a guy in ten days by doing all the things girls do wrong in romantic relationships for her column she writes for the magazine. Ben's is to make a girl fall in love with him in 10 days and if he succeeds he gets the bit he's been wanting to do on diamonds at work.This twist brings Andie and Ben together in a whirlwind of hilarious situations and very amusing scenes.When the ten days are up what will happen?I highly recommend this movie to any romantic comedy lovers~ Watch Kate Hudson at her best- this proves her acting skills are absolutely incredible!For laughs and amusement this movie is a must! If you have not seen it I highly recommend you do very soon!Also I rate the extras a 9 out of 10! The VHS version is good but the DVD version is definetley worth checking out!

The dialogue and writing were witty, and the story was romantic in a way that men and women found enjoyable (and occasionally hilarious).  The producers of this movie would have you believe that this too is a 'romantic comedy', but they're lying.The fact that this movie has 'fans' seems to prove Albert Einstein correct*. Either it's proof of Einstein's insight, or it's an attempt to test H.L. Mencken's hypothesis that ""No one ever went broke trying to underestimate the intelligence of the American public.""This movie is completely moronic, aimed at those on the left tail of 'The Bell Curve', and probably written by adults who taped the conversations at a college fraternity/sorority, b*llsh*tt*ng after the brothers/sisters had a few drinks.There is not a single engaging or likeable character in this movie.  The story is idiotic and not at all credible. The premise makes no sense either --  Matthew McConaughey plays an advertising executive who bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days. If successful, then he'll win a major account that will secure a big career.  With this movie, the whole world can now learn why decent people in Austin, Texas regard Mr. McConaughey as an embarrassing local jerk.Kate Hudson was convincing as a brainless rock-band groupie in ""Almost Famous"", and here she's still the same bubble-brain, but clearly out of her league.I may watch this DVD all the way to its end some day (if someone else lends me another copy). But 20 minutes of Fast-Forward & play convinced me that there is nothing worth shelling out real money for here.* Actual Einstein quote:""In my opinion, only two things are infinite.

Andie is tasked by her editor to find a man, start a relationship with him, and the do the stereotypical things that drive men away (for instance, redecorating his apartment with stuffed animals, using baby talk).  The result of her experiment will become the subject of her next column.  Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is an advertising executive who, in order to win a major account, bets that he can win the heart of any woman.  These two characters target each other for their article and bet, and the movie sets off on its predictable path.Don't get me wrong: I did enjoy the movie.  Hudson and McConaughey have good chemistry, and are supported by an excellent ensemble that includes a good performance by Bebe Neuwirth as Andie's editor.  The things that Hudson's character contrives to drive Ben away are often humorous, and the lengths to which Ben goes to tolerate Andie's behavior are also funny.The rest of this paragraph may be considered a SPOILER by anyone who hasn't seen a Hollywood movie in the last decade.

744183,A2VZ11U5DXM8J5,B00008KDGZ,"C. Ebeling ""ctlpareader""","[1, 3]","""How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days"" is a movie that has the classic bones of the type of bubbly romantic comedy we used to see far more of before 1970.  Doris Day and Rock Hudson plus good writers could have pulled it off spectacularly.  The premise is that Kate  Hudson's character is assigned a magazine article for a trendy magazine, the theme being the movie's title.  Matthew McConaughey is a serial bachelor determined to win a wager that he can engage in a serious relationship. Each becomes the other's prey, and what ensues is Hudson's writer pushed to more and more excessive behavior to shake the unshakable and unbelievably patient suitor.Hudson, McConaughey and a talented supporting cast are ready and willing but their efforts are decimated by messy writing and an uneven, mean-spirited plot that never succeeds in suspending disbelief.  Rather than the witty 21st century battle of the sexes that this should have been, it feels more like ""Fatal Attraction"" with crocheted poodle toilet paper cozies.  Hudson's antics are agonizing and the scenes don't know when to end.  They lack a snappy rhythm.  Some lines were crossed that leave the civil world of romantic comedy behind.  Sticking the guy with the pet he never ordered without knowing whether he would take responsibility contemplates animal cruelty.  Dragging innocent family members into the mess does not seem particularly fair, and it is quite hard to appreciate the leads when they use someone else's special event for their own ugly climax.  Their original intentions are unprincipled, using supposedly innocent strangers for personal gain, but that scruple is easily resolved by the dual agendas, so that isn't a problem. Had they been played out with genuine humor and less extreme behavior, had the infliction of cruelty been confined just to the lead characters who finally reach the big revelation that they are basically good people and meant for each other (that's not giving away the plot because it is to be assumed), had it been a genuine lesson in how women and men think about romance, then it would be the film it should have been.",2,"Shoulda, woulda, coulda --  it doesn't.",1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2118,"['How', 'Lose', 'A', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'movie', 'classic', 'bones', 'type', 'bubbly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'used', 'see', 'far', 'more', '1970', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'good', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'spectacularly', 'premise', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'character', 'assigned', 'magazine', 'article', 'trendy', 'magazine', 'theme', 'being', 'movie', 'title', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'serial', 'bachelor', 'determined', 'win', 'wager', 'can', 'engage', 'serious', 'relationship', 'other', 'prey', 'what', 'Hudson', 'writer', 'pushed', 'more', 'more', 'excessive', 'behavior', 'shake', 'unshakable', 'unbelievably', 'patient', 'suitor.Hudson', 'McConaughey', 'talented', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'ready', 'willing', 'efforts', 'are', 'decimated', 'messy', 'writing', 'uneven', 'mean-spirited', 'plot', 'never', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'Rather', 'witty', '21st', 'century', 'battle', 'sexes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'crocheted', 'poodle', 'toilet', 'paper', 'cozies', 'Hudson', 'antics', 'are', 'agonizing', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'end', 'lack', 'snappy', 'rhythm', 'lines', 'were', 'crossed', 'leave', 'civil', 'world', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Sticking', 'guy', 'pet', 'never', 'ordered', 'knowing', 'would', 'take', 'responsibility', 'contemplates', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'Dragging', 'innocent', 'family', 'members', 'mess', 'not', 'seem', 'particularly', 'fair', 'quite', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'leads', 'when', 'use', 'someone', 'else', 'special', 'event', 'own', 'ugly', 'climax', 'original', 'intentions', 'are', 'unprincipled', 'using', 'supposedly', 'innocent', 'strangers', 'personal', 'gain', 'scruple', 'easily', 'resolved', 'dual', 'agendas', ""n't"", 'problem', 'Had', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'genuine', 'humor', 'less', 'extreme', 'behavior', 'had', 'infliction', 'cruelty', 'been', 'confined', 'just', 'lead', 'characters', 'who', 'finally', 'reach', 'big', 'revelation', 'are', 'basically', 'good', 'people', 'meant', 'other', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'be', 'assumed', 'had', 'been', 'genuine', 'lesson', 'how', 'women', 'men', 'think', 'romance', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been']",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

Kate Hudson looks just like her mother and plays a perfect seductress turned who knows what.  Matthew McConaughey is perfect in this role as stud, but supreme ladies man.  Each seems like the bets they partake in, but true love shines through for both and there is an ultimately happy ending.  It's got a great soundtrack, and even a great, though terribly, awful rendition of You're So Vain that had me in stitches.

This is too bad, because for a while in the middle I was starting to enjoy this goofy movie. Ultimately, though, it was as my mother would say ""Sha-poopy.""Kate Hudson stars as Andie Anderson, a columnist for a ""Vogue""-type magazine who longs to write about important issues like the refugee plight in ""Takijstan"". Instead, she is saddled with an assignment to drive a man away in ten days by committing all the supposedly classic mistakes woman make in relationships. You know, calling a guy fifty million times a day, telling him you love him after knowing him less than a week, etc. Matthew McConaughey is a slick ad exec named Ben who attempts to prove he can handle a big account targeted toward women by making a random woman fall in love with him, also in ten days (This part of the plot is pretty shaky, to tell you the truth). Of the millions of people in New York, guess which two hook up in a crowded bar?Of course, none of the nutty things Andie does to Ben send him packing, so her ideas gradually become more and more outrageous. This part of the movie actually borders on being funny, as Andie humiliates Ben in wilder and wilder ways; redecorating his apartment, getting him beat up, and (horrors!) dragging him to see Celine Dion. There is also a sweet scene involving Ben's parents and a rather colorful card game, but the final fifteen minutes or so return to the strained feeling of the beginning before we finally get to the end we all knew was coming.Kate Hudson's once promising career really started to go downhill with this film, and even though you can see the Goldie Hawn sparkle she doesn't appear to have her mother's magnetism. Simply put: Kate grates. And don't get me started on McConaughey, who with the exception of ""A Time to Kill"" plays the same part in every movie. His character here is really no different from his character in ""Sahara"", and that's saying something.If you really want a modern romantic comedy, I recommend ""Two Weeks Notice"" or ""Laws of Attraction"". While no classics, these two are at least funny and unpainful. As for ""Ten Days"", I would say as a point of reference it's worse than ""Miss Congeniality"" but better than ""The Wedding Planner"". But then again, what isn't.GRADE: C+(By the way, for those who care, I will admit Kate trounces ""Maid in Manhattan's"" J.Lo in the Looking-Stunning-While-Wearing-A-Designer-Dress Department.

The twist - the male character trying to get the woman to love him, and the female character trying to drive him away - it totally original and exceptionally funny.The movie involves just a touch of sexual content, but it's nothing extreme, and can be considered mild compared to the other things you see nowadays. It's sweet and understandable. In one scene, the female character mentions that she wants the male character's respect, and he follows through loyally.Even though it gets boring in a couple spots, Kate Hudson provides great comic relief in the most unexpected times.

It&#65533;s just too darn bad she has such conventional taste in movies.  So of course I have gotten very used to the occasional chick flick.  They make her laugh, even if I don&#65533;t get it or care too.  They fill her with glee but they fill me with loathing.  But every once and while a chick flick comes along that is so conventional, and so silly.  That I&#65533;m am filled with Apathy instead of loathing.  So I guess that&#65533;s the only way to describe HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS: a conventional film that filled with apathy.Like every romantic comedy 10 DAYS tells the story of two beautiful people and how they get to know each other, falling in and out of love with each other, and then telling there less attractive friends about how happy they are.In this film those two people are Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson, Almost Famous) and Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughy, EDTV), they are so adorable their first names have that same first letter as their last name (they might want to shoot their parents).  They each meet under dubious circumstances, she has to write and article about the mistakes women make while dating, and he has to make her fall in love with him to win an advertising account.  So of course in the process they both fall in love and wild comedic scenes take place.What works in the film are Hudson and McConaughy, they have really nice chemistry together.  They have a really sweet conversation when they first meet. It is constructed with just pithy little statements, and it is both silly and charming.  Hudson also relishes torturing McConaughy with her silly dating games.  The scene in which she breaks up the boy&#65533;s poker game really enchanted me.  Not a terribly inspired scene but it has a really nice comedic tone.  So at least it worked for me.I also liked the scene at Ben&#65533;s parent&#65533;s house.  The game of B.S. was inspired.  This scene works because for once the colorful family doesn&#65533;t act like buffoons.  This scene is also much too good for this movie.I just hated that the film was so conventional.  In the course of an hour and forty minutes, they meet, fall in love, fall out of love, and realize they both really love each other and live happily ever after.  Its plot is constructed out of every romantic comedy cliche ever made.What also bothered me was that our two star-crossed lovers are far to good for the material.  The concept would work without sitcom jokes and witty one liners; but of course in Hollywood unconventional ...  If you are looking for a good night out with your lady friend, 10 DAYS will make her smile.  But may I recommend a better romantic comedy, Benny and Joon.

The premise is that both of them are working in opposite directions at first, with her being tasked to write a column as the ""how-to"" girl for a Cosmopolitan-like magazine on how to do everything wrong in a relationship and drive guys away.He, on the other hand, is an advertising exec hoping to get past his genre of beer and women to move on to more glamorous, upscale markets like diamonds.

She wants to write more serious issues, like politics, poverty, etc. Currently, she writes a monthly article called ""How to..."" Her friend has been broken up with. She made all of the mistakes you make in a relationship that has been going on for a week. Andi decides to save her friends butt and herself, and write ""How to lose a guy in 10 days,"" at her bosses request.Ben is an advertising exec, who is cool and cocky. He wants this assignment for diamonds, big client. He somehow lets out that he can make any woman fall in love with him.

They will find out the results at the ""diamond"" party. Can he do it? Can she make him leave? The results, at least, started out to be interesting.She goes about, making all of the mistakes women make to chase men away. I have to admit, this was the best part of the movie.These are some tricks she tries:*Making him go for soda the last few minutes of a Knicks game.*Telling him that she doesn't eat meat after he has made lamb and making him go to a vegetarian place and eat barley and tofu.*Bringing pink objects to decorate his place and stuffed animals to live on his couch and bed.*Acting like a happy lovey puppy all of the time, then crying the next minute for no reason.You get the idea. Good concept, but could have been carried through a little bit better.Anyway, the end turns out to be predictable and formulaic, but I did get something from it. I'm sure there will come a time where Kate Hudson can't help the movie by acting adorable. She did help it enough to keep me there, but not enough to keep me from making fun of it.

At certain angles, Kate looks like Goldie when she was younger. The same trademark giggle and cheeky grins are there, but for me Goldie has that certain X factor, and is definitely more well endowed than her daughter (and it shows). The story line is simple, and one I can empathize with as I am The Travelling Gourmet &amp; I am a Travel, Food &amp; Wine journalist. Kate is a journalist for a top womens' magazine in New York and for a story, she is assigned to write a piece (journalistic lingo for story or article) on &quot;How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days&quot; To do this her simple minded plan is to entice and ensnare a guy in a short while &amp; then to dump him unceremoniously in 10 days. Of course, all sorts of funny and hilarious things happen in between like when she invades his bachelor pad with all her cuddly stuffed toys, bears and what have you! Also, she crashes his weekly Poker Party with the boys and creates havoc with her PMS tantrums. Then there is the classic scene where she tells him she is a vegetarian after he has slaved over a hot stove to cook her a gourmet meal of Lamb. Another classic is the restaurant scene where she accuses him falsely of calling her &quot;FAT&quot;. What a guy, he is so tolerant he even falls in love with her! he is the Sensitive New Age Man personified. Well, who can blame him. She is undoubtedly beautiful, with or without cleavage. As star she is sure to rise and shine very fast in the future. I liked the portrayal of a HARD AS NAILS editor; very true to life. I have known editors like her, only better looking but still tough to the core beneath their designer power suits complete with immaculately varnished shocking red nails. The scenes in the magazine publishing house is very realistic, as is the scene where the stories are assigned to various writers during an Editorial meeting. I was thinking as I watched, &quot;Is it Art imitating Life, or vice versa, or both??&quot; The twist is that the guy also has underhand plans of his own to get a plum advertising account for a Diamond tycoon. What a world! To do this he has to prove he can ensnare Kate with his macho charms. Anyway, to cut a long story short, true LOVE wins in the end and triumphs over all obstacles. This only goes to show you how true the motto of the SAS is as WHO DARES WINS! I watched this with someone I love very much, and I recommend you watch this with someone you love very much too.

It's packed full of laughs and fun and boasts a great cast that gives it the edge over the slew of romantic comedies recently released.Ben (Matthew McConaughey) makes a bet with his boss that he can get a woman to fall in love with him in ten days to land a valuable advertising campaign (don't ask questions, you'll understand when you see the movie).  Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) is the ""How To..."" columnist as the hot new women's magazine, Composure.  The topic of Andie's next column?  How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days, hence the name of the film.  If Andie writes the article, her boss, Lana, will give her complete freedom on the topics she writes about Apparently Andie wants to write about ""serious"" issues.  That's great, hon, but why are you working at a glossy fashion mag if you want to write articles on global issues?Of course, Ben and Andie see each other at a bar and coincidentally choose each other as their ""victims"".  And then you know what happens...Kate Hudson is an absolute gem!  She is sweet, funny, and completely adorable.  The audience genuinely likes Kate Hudson, and thus sympathizes with Andie.  A big problem with most romantic comedies is that the characters are so dislikable that you don't really care what happens to them.  Kate Hudson was able to prevent that.McConaughey was fine, but I firmly believe that he doesn't really act in films, just plays himself (he plays the same kind of guy in almost all his movies).Ever noticed how most romantic comedies are really quite funny until they reach that inevitable stage when the two stop hating each other (or whatever was holding them from love) and fall in love?  Take McConaughey's ""The Wedding Planner"" (another film in which McConaughey plays himself), which I thoroughly enjoyed until they fell in love.  ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" blessedly does not fall under this category.

Instead, she's the ""How to..."" columnist for the trendy women's magazine, COMPOSURE. When her Editor comes up with an article idea, Andie quickly takes the job. Now she's writing a first-hand account on what it takes to drive a guy out of your life in exactly 10 days. While this new assignment for Andie is taking place, ad agency bachelor, Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) accepts an extremely high-stakes bet that he can make any woman fall entirely head-over-heels in love with him in...exactly 10 days. When the two of them end up with each other, it's a laugh-out-loud hilarious thrill ride for all.There is only one sentence to describe Kate Hudson's performance in this film...utterly fabulous. Everything about her is amazing. Her acting skills shine bigger and better in this movie than in her past films. Matthew McConaughey is hilarious, as he takes everything that Kate's character does in stride, and puts up with all of her freakish antics throughout the entire movie. Fans of romantic comedies such as MISS CONGENIALITY and SWEET HOME ALABAMA will relish in this film about falling in love.

This movie has these elements.  Kate Hudson plays a &quot;How To&quot; columnist for a fluffy women's mag, but she really wants to write about serious subjects.  She is trying to impress her boss (Bebe Newirth) enough to earn free reign on her writing.  In this process and after her coworker whines incessantly about being dumped, Hudson opts to write a reverse How To on what turns guys off.  She must find a guy that will fall for her, then do everything that women do wrong in relationships.  Concurrently, Matthew McConaghey plays a sharp-shooting, go-getter ad exec who has thus far worked predominantly in the sports arena.  He would like to break into the very lucrative world of jewelry.  What stands in his way?  Two lovely ladies who believe they can do it better, and have the ear of McConaghey's boss.  McConaghey makes a bet that he can make any woman fall in love with him in 10 days, in order to prove his adeptness at knowing and being able to speak to the female mind.  His opposition, having overheard Hudson's latest assignment, pick her seemingly randomly as McConaghey's target, thinking he's sure to lose.  This is how the couple comes together.  The rest of the movie is how they come apart ... and it's funny.  Actually, it's almost uncomfortably funny.  Your sides will split in laughter in parts of the movie.  Plus, you'll wonder how Kate Hudson ever managed to get through the embarrassingly funny things she did in her attempt to scare off unsuspecting McConaghey.  Kate's performance is perfect.  In the end, as you just have to know, the truth unravels with the unwitting help of McConaghey's sidekicks.  All in all, this movie has everything ... a good plot, good acting, lots of laughs, and ample chemistry.  This one is a must for the avid romantic comedy collector.  (and guys should like it too)As for the DVD itself ... The deleted scenes aren't bad to watch, but the movie wasn't missing anything for having left them on the cutting room floor.

Perhaps you have seen the trailers and thought you knew the movie already.  Needless to say, you come in with little to no expectations.  For this movie, I expected to get some reading done, but found myself watching the movie and getting a laugh or two.Business agendas and love do not go together, and this movie highlights that fact.  While Matthew McConaughey is trying to win an account by getting someone to fall in love with him, Kate Hudson is writing a story about losing a guy in just ten days.  In both cases, they are not in complete control.  Kate's editor tells her she must write the story while Matthew's competitors choose his girlfriend.The comedy comes in what should be a romp through the things that a woman may do to scare a man off; however, the true comedy comes in the patience the man shows when the woman's tactics get a little unbelievable.  The tactics, like planning their wedding and life together after only having been dated a few days, seem a bit much.  The characters seem to know that this is extreme and because of this, I don't think the extremity hurt the movie.  Just trying to cope good naturedly takes everything they have.I would recommend this for some light viewing.

Unbeknownst to her, the man she gets is Matthew McConaughey, an ad exec who has been challenged by his boss and competitors at work to make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days or less. See? One wants to wreck it at all costs, one wants to save it at all costs. The wackiness is supposed to ensue.Why It Doesn't Work: This type of set-up forces two very amiable stars to behave like nitwits for the entire film. By the time they inevitably discover that each was deceiving the other, you haven't developed any sympathy for either character. You don't care if they get past it and end up together. If just one was deceiving the other, you'd have a place to make your emotional connection to what's happening, and it doesn't even necessarily preclude you from ending up liking the deceiver (especially if he or she is being deceptive for reasons beyond their control). Here, however, they're both being extraordinarly callous about the feelings of another human being, for pretty flimsy reasons. After awhile, rather than sucking you in, it just starts to piss you off.McConaughey's a very likeable star, and I'm crazy about Hudson. I'm inclined to like any movie she makes.

She writes the ""How To"" column intended for a female audience (Composure is similar to Cosmo or Glamour).  The column she agrees to write for the current month is ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"".

These mistakes will cause the guy to dump Andie in 10 days or less, which is just in time for Andie to finish her column and get it published.Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) works in advertising.  He is very good at what he does, but he is known for working on ""guy"" related campaigns.  Ben wants to land his company's largest client, a diamond company, but he is seen as not having the right expertise and style for it.  Ben is very good at selling himself and convinces his boss that he can get any woman to fall in love with him (being able to do this is similar to being able to sell diamonds, apparently).  His boss gives him ten days, until a party that his boss is throwing for the new client.  Benjamin has to be able to prove to his boss that the woman he brings to the party has truly fallen in love with him.Out of all of the people in New York City, Andie and Ben are going to meet at the perfect time to start dating and try to work out their conflicting assignments.

744245,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00008KDGZ,Joseph Haschka,"[1, 1]","Once upon a time, Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson appeared in fine dramatic roles. LONE STAR (1996) and A TIME TO KILL (1996) come to mind for the former, and ALMOST FAMOUS (2000) for the latter. HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS is a pleasant, but inconsequential, piece of fluff for both.Hudson plays Andie, the How To girl for ""Composure"" magazine (a fictional ""Cosmopolitan""), and the writer of such articles as ""How to Beat A Traffic Ticket"". Inspired by her best girlfriend's bad luck with men, she volunteers to write a piece, HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS. As her boss (Bebe Neuwirth) puts it, ""Five days is too short, and the magazine goes to print in eleven."" Andie is to base her article on the exercise of attracting a single man, then employing her womanly wiles to drive him to dump her. (Hudson's real-life Mom, Goldie Hawn, would also have been perfect for the Andie role in her younger years.)McConaughey is Ben, who works for an ad agency, and is out to convince his boss that he, not two female colleagues, is best able to devise an ad campaign for a major diamond wholesaler. Ben wins the assignment if he can make good on a bet, i.e. that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days.Andie and Ben target each other at a party, and the battle of totally opposite agendas is on. At one point, as both gaze lovingly at each other, Andie's inner thought is revealed by a voiceover: ""I'm going to make you wish you were dead.""  Get the drift of the plot?McConaughey and Hudson are both enormously attractive actors, and so this film is certainly not unpleasant. OK, ok - it's cute. Hudson's Andie is the meatier of the two roles, best seen when she intrudes on Ben's night of poker with his male buds. The script works - most of the time.

Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[1, 1]","The ever-adorable and delightfully gorgeous Hudson is Andie Anderson, a columnist for one of those women's magazines that offer all manner of good advice. In this case the magazine is called Composure and Andie writes the regular How To column. You know the sort of thing - How to dress to your body shape, How to lose 150kg in three weeks,  How to have the ultimate orgasm...and so on and so on. But Andie wishes to be taken as a credible journalist and dreams of the day when she can write articles on politics or How to Bring Peace to Tajikistan, but her editor will have nothing of it, so the How To column continues focusing on relationships, fashion, glamour, and salacious gossip. When colleague and friend Michelle (Kathryn Hahn) suffers yet another mystifying break-up with her new boyfriend of only a week, Andie gets an idea for a new column. It will be a dating guide in reverse - a guide to all the things NOT to do if you want to keep your man and will be called How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. The catch is that she will experience this first hand. She will hook a guy at a bar, seduce him and once he's hooked, unleash every rotten girl-trick in the book to drive him away - all inside 10 days.Meanwhile, advertising exec Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is desperate to get appointed to lead the ad campaign for a new diamond promotion and will basically do anything to get the chance to make the pitch for the diamond campaign. Ever the ladies man, he makes the bold claim to colleagues that he could easily make a girl fall in love with him - inside 10 days, and they challenge him provided they can pick the target (I think you can see where this is heading). His boss agrees to the challenge and provided Ben can have a girl madly in love with him by the time of the big promotional party, the ad campaign is his.What follows is a series of humorous scenes in which Andie and Ben hook up and she proceeds to drive him completely crazy by doing everything in her girl-power to make him dump her. Ben of course will suffer through anything and gleefully accepts all manner of horrible girl problems that Andie can throw at him. There is perfect chemistry between McConaughey and Hudson, and herein lies the strength of this film, because in a nutshell it adds precious little to the age-old ""lets make a bet about love and hope the other side doesn't find out, but they do"" routine. There are some genuinely funny moments - I can only imagine the pain of having a new girlfriend nickname your p**** 'Princess Sophia', or being forced to attend a chick-flick marathon at the local cinema, but it is the actions and the reactions of both McConaughey and Hudson to each other that many will find ultimately engaging.",4,Hilarious!,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,2734,"['ever-adorable', 'delightfully', 'gorgeous', 'Hudson', 'Andie', 'Anderson', 'columnist', 'one', 'women', 'magazines', 'offer', 'manner', 'good', 'advice', 'case', 'magazine', 'called', 'Composure', 'Andie', 'regular', 'How', 'column', 'know', 'sort', 'thing', 'How', 'dress', 'body', 'shape', 'How', 'lose', '150kg', 'three', 'weeks', 'How', 'have', 'ultimate', 'orgasm', 'so', 'so', 'Andie', 'be', 'taken', 'credible', 'journalist', 'dreams', 'day', 'when', 'can', 'write', 'articles', 'politics', 'How', 'Bring', 'Peace', 'Tajikistan', 'editor', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'so', 'How', 'column', 'focusing', 'relationships', 'fashion', 'glamour', 'salacious', 'gossip', 'When', 'colleague', 'friend', 'Michelle', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'yet', 'mystifying', 'break-up', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'only', 'week', 'Andie', 'idea', 'new', 'column', 'will', 'be', 'dating', 'guide', 'reverse', 'guide', 'things', 'NOT', 'do', 'want', 'keep', 'man', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'How', 'Lose', 'A', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'catch', 'will', 'experience', 'first', 'hand', 'will', 'hook', 'guy', 'bar', 'seduce', 'once', 'hooked', 'unleash', 'rotten', 'girl-trick', 'book', 'drive', 'away', '10', 'days.Meanwhile', 'advertising', 'exec', 'Benjamin', 'Barry', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'desperate', 'get', 'appointed', 'lead', 'ad', 'campaign', 'new', 'diamond', 'promotion', 'will', 'basically', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'chance', 'make', 'pitch', 'diamond', 'campaign', 'Ever', 'ladies', 'man', 'bold', 'claim', 'colleagues', 'could', 'easily', 'make', 'girl', 'fall', 'love', 'inside', '10', 'days', 'challenge', 'provided', 'can', 'pick', 'target', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'heading', 'boss', 'challenge', 'provided', 'Ben', 'can', 'have', 'girl', 'madly', 'love', 'time', 'big', 'promotional', 'party', 'ad', 'campaign', 'series', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'Andie', 'Ben', 'hook', 'up', 'drive', 'completely', 'crazy', 'doing', 'everything', 'girl-power', 'make', 'dump', 'Ben', 'course', 'will', 'suffer', 'anything', 'gleefully', 'manner', 'horrible', 'girl', 'problems', 'Andie', 'can', 'throw', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'McConaughey', 'Hudson', 'herein', 'strength', 'film', 'nutshell', 'precious', 'little', 'age-old', 'lets', 'make', 'bet', 'love', 'hope', 'other', 'side', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'do', 'routine', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'pain', 'having', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'p****', 'Sophia', 'being', 'forced', 'attend', 'chick-flick', 'marathon', 'local', 'cinema', 'actions', 'reactions', 'McConaughey', 'Hudson', 'other', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'ultimately', 'engaging']",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

Cutting a long story short, she has to write a story about How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days (what a surprise?).  She meets (not by complete chance) Benjamin Barry (who is on a mission to make a girl fall completely in love with him in 10 days before a product launch).Well, you can imagine how this movie goes, but it is funny and it is cute and it is good light fluffy escapism.

Andie (Kate Hudson) is a 'How-To-Girl' at a magazine and one day she has to make a story, How to lose aguy in 10 days. She will start dating a man and then drive him away, in 10 days, with things, that women usually do, that man don't like. Benjamin (Matthew McConaughey) works in advertising. One day he makes a bet with two of his co-workers. He will get the most important work, if he will bring a woman, which will be totally in love with him, to a party 10 days from that day. And his co-workers choose, which woman will that be. They, knowing what Andie is about to do, choose her, but do not tell Ben. So, the problem occurs in their relationship. One wants to make it last at least 10 days, but the other wants to end it before the 10 days are gone by. So through series of comic events the 10th day comes. So on the party, they both find out about another one's lying and they break up. But it wouldn't be a romantic comedy, if they wouldn't end up together.How to lose a guy in 10 days is one of the most romantic comedies in my opinion. Also the actors are really good. I mean, Matthew is an ok actor, he can be funny from time to time. But Kate Hudson was the one that I really loved in that movie. She's a great actress.

I can't say I'm that big a fan of Matthew or Kate, as haven't really seen them in that many films (A Time To Kill & Gossip are the only ones that come to mind). Plus, I needed to get a third movie to get the good deal, and it was between this & 40 Days & 40 Nights. I've heard that's really bad, so I got this.With Goldie Hawn for a mother, Kate is coming straight from comic stock, so it might have been disappointing if she didn't live up to expectations, but the girl is funny! From just her facial expressions & mannerisms, you'll be in fits. Personally, the defining moment from the whole film for me was when Kate's character Andie was sitting in her office, eating a burger, and she talks with her mouth completely PACKED full! It's the look on her face at the same time, and the fact you can't understand a word she says. I had to watch this little scene over & over, in fits of giggles the whole time.The plot was surprisingly original for a rom-com/battle of the sexes movie. The formula was followed strictly, and I was under no illusion what the final outcome would be, but the best part of this movie was laughed at.Guys, if you're easily scared, then I suggest you don't watch this movie. Andie has to make a guy date her, before she prepares to get him out of her life - in 10 days. To succeed she goes as far as taking him to a Celine Dion concert; gets him to get her a Coke in the last minutes of a (crucial?) Nicks game; destroys his poker game; on their SECOND date, brings over fluffy toys, pink toilet cover, a signed framed photo of her, a plant; takes him to a couples therapist after 7 days; pretends to be vegetarian after he makes a lamb dinner; cries that he called her fat; names a certain part of his anatomy by the oh-so-unappropriate name of Princess Sophia and many more disbelieving things.Another highlight of the movie was their ""fight"" and changing to the lyrics to ""You're So Vain"" by Carly Simon. They absolutely butcher the song beyond belief.Other stars include the lovely Adam Goldberg and Thomas Lennon - the latter is listed here, because it always bugs me where I know him from. He was in A Guy Thing too, but most notably, in FRIENDS!!! (You knew I was gonna say that, didn't you?) He was in The One In Vegas, the one who Joey thinks has the exact same hands as him.This was a great movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will definitely rewatch at some point.

The machinations of the plot take a back seat, though to the very real and palpable romantic combustion that his stars ignite on screen. And like their recent predecessors, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant for example, Hudson and McConaughey are a believable and natural couple: we can actually picture them in bed together. Which, if this type of film is going to work is absolutely necessary, as real chemistry between stars is a very rare thing. McConaughey didn't have it with Jennifer Lopez in ""The Wedding Planner"" but Ralph Fiennes (!) did in ""Maid in Manhattan."" Go figure.In a comedy, it is the supporting actors and the characters they play who add texture and substance to the proceedings. Think Rosie O'Donnell in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or Rhys Ifans in ""Notting Hill."" These characters, besides stealing most scenes that they are in, also give the film a context in which the main characters live. Unfortunately, only a couple of the supporting players in ""How To"" really pop.

I was waiting for the big laughs that never came. The storyline, when you think about it, is questionable: How do you make it funny, anyway? It's just weird. And not cool-weird or good-weird, just weird. Like impossible-weird. She's doing a magazine article on &quot;what not to do on a date&quot; and wants to drive away this guy in ten days. He wants to make her fall in love with him to prove to this people that he can make girls fall in love with the diamonds they're selling. So...she's trying to make him hate her, he's trying to make her love him. It's not that funny, it's simply a bit strange. I rented this with &quot;Bringing Down the House,&quot; and just as a comparison between two supposed comedies, I laughed hysterically throughout and thoroughly enjoyed the Queen Latifah/Steve Martin movie. This one, on the other hand, bored me. I stopped watching after about half an hour and I don't know how I could've kept going though another hour and a half of it. This is NOT the film it's made out to be...There must have been SOME part I liked...for instance, the moment when she first gets the job of driving the guy away. From there, everything's downhill.

744283,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B00008KDGZ,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[0, 0]","I'm not quite sure where to start with this one. I didn't have high expectations, after seeing the trailer, but I thought it was an interesting premise, so finally I rented it. My initial skepticism was promptly validated. Until about 2/3 of the way through the movie I was going to write a rather scathing review and certainly not give it more than a 3.0 rating. The basic plotline is this: Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) writes a ""How to"" column for a rather flaky looking magazine that usually covers topics like clothes, diets, dating, etc. Her current topic is ""How to lose a guy in 10 days,"" and she's made a bargain with her boss that if she can successfully drive a man away in that amount of time, she'll finally be able to write about issues that really matter - politics, religion, etc.Meanwhile, Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) works in advertising, and is desperate to be the one appointed to handle a contract with a huge diamond company. While trying to persuade his boss that he's the right man for the job, the topic of selling diamonds is somehow made synonymous with Ben's ability to sell himself to any woman alive. His boss agrees that he can have the job if he can make a woman (picked by two of his co-workers) fall madly in love with him in the next ten days. He agrees. The co-workers pick a woman out of the crowd and, big surprise, it's Andie. The two begin to date, with Andie doing everything she possibly can to drive him mad, and Ben doing everything he can think of to win her heart. Predictably, they end up falling for each other, and much professional and internal conflict ensues.As I said earlier, the first 2/3 of the film did little to win me over. Most of the characters seemed just too incredibly fake to care about, particularly Andie. The makers of the film took a big gamble, whether they know it or not. The power of romantic comedies comes from having the audience truly wanting the two protagonists to get together in the end. Here, Andie comes across as a cold, calculating snob for much of the first part of the movie, while Ben is a cocky, arrogant playboy. I just didn't feel like rooting for either of them.It's not until the sequence where Ben takes Andie to Staten Island to meet his family that the two really begin to seem like caring, feeling beings. At that point the characters' emotions were much more genuine, and the story began to pick up. From there on I really liked the film, even though the very end was perhaps a little too contrived ... But the chemistry really does come through in the latter part of the film, and thus I raised my rating to a generous four stars.The acting is fairly good all around, despite the fact that most of Andie's co-workers are rather stereotypical scatterbrains who live on emotional roller coasters and think the world is made better by a cup of coffee and new clothes. I'm not sure whether their characters were supposed to be genuine or satire, but either way it adds some comic value to the film. I particularly liked the scenes with Ben's family, as the interactions there seemed the most genuine, and the people there the most real (they're a bit odd at times, granted, but don't most families have their quirks?).DVD features include director commentary, a ""Mapping Out the Perfect Movie"" sequence with cast and crew interviews that provide extra insight into the film, deleted scenes (most of which I'm glad were not included in the actual film), a ""Mapping Out the Perfect Location"" featurette, and a music video of the song ""Somebody Like You."" My parting advice: If you don't like romantic comedies to begin with, don't see this movie. It's [probably] not the one that will win you over to the genre. If you do like romantic comedies (or even if you just have a thing for Matthew McConaughey), it's worth seeing, though it isn't the best. I'd advise renting it first to decide if you really like it or not.",4,"(3.5) A movie with flaws, but it improves toward the end.",1080000000,"03 23, 2004",2004,3918,"[""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'start', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'premise', 'finally', 'rented', 'My', 'initial', 'skepticism', 'was', 'promptly', 'validated', '2/3', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'write', 'rather', 'scathing', 'review', 'certainly', 'not', 'give', 'more', '3.0', 'rating', 'basic', 'plotline', 'Andie', 'Anderson', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'How', 'column', 'rather', 'flaky', 'looking', 'magazine', 'usually', 'topics', 'clothes', 'diets', 'dating', 'etc', 'current', 'topic', 'How', 'lose', 'guy', '10', 'days', 'made', 'bargain', 'boss', 'can', 'successfully', 'drive', 'man', 'away', 'amount', 'time', ""'ll"", 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'write', 'issues', 'really', 'matter', 'politics', 'religion', 'etc.Meanwhile', 'Benjamin', 'Barry', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'advertising', 'desperate', 'be', 'one', 'appointed', 'handle', 'contract', 'huge', 'diamond', 'company', 'trying', 'persuade', 'boss', 'right', 'man', 'job', 'topic', 'selling', 'diamonds', 'somehow', 'made', 'synonymous', 'Ben', 'ability', 'sell', 'woman', 'alive', 'boss', 'can', 'have', 'job', 'can', 'make', 'woman', 'picked', 'two', 'co-workers', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'next', 'ten', 'days', 'co-workers', 'pick', 'woman', 'crowd', 'big', 'surprise', 'Andie', 'two', 'begin', 'date', 'Andie', 'doing', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'drive', 'mad', 'Ben', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'think', 'win', 'heart', 'Predictably', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'other', 'much', 'professional', 'internal', 'conflict', 'ensues.As', 'said', 'earlier', 'first', '2/3', 'film', 'did', 'little', 'win', 'over', 'Most', 'characters', 'seemed', 'just', 'too', 'incredibly', 'fake', 'care', 'particularly', 'Andie', 'makers', 'film', 'took', 'big', 'gamble', 'know', 'not', 'power', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'having', 'audience', 'truly', 'wanting', 'two', 'protagonists', 'get', 'together', 'end', 'Here', 'Andie', 'across', 'cold', 'calculating', 'snob', 'much', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Ben', 'cocky', 'arrogant', 'playboy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'rooting', 'them.It', 'not', 'sequence', 'where', 'Ben', 'Andie', 'Staten', 'Island', 'meet', 'family', 'two', 'really', 'begin', 'seem', 'caring', 'feeling', 'beings', 'point', 'characters', 'emotions', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'genuine', 'story', 'began', 'pick', 'up', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'even', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'contrived', 'chemistry', 'really', 'come', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'thus', 'raised', 'rating', 'generous', 'four', 'stars.The', 'acting', 'fairly', 'good', 'around', 'fact', 'most', 'Andie', 'co-workers', 'are', 'rather', 'stereotypical', 'scatterbrains', 'who', 'live', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coasters', 'think', 'world', 'made', 'better', 'cup', 'coffee', 'new', 'clothes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'characters', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'genuine', 'satire', 'way', 'comic', 'value', 'film', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scenes', 'Ben', 'family', 'interactions', 'there', 'seemed', 'most', 'genuine', 'people', 'there', 'most', 'real', ""'re"", 'bit', 'odd', 'times', 'granted', 'do', ""n't"", 'most', 'families', 'have', 'quirks', '.DVD', 'features', 'include', 'director', 'commentary', 'Mapping', 'Out', 'Perfect', 'Movie', 'sequence', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'provide', 'extra', 'insight', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'most', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'actual', 'film', 'Mapping', 'Out', 'Perfect', 'Location', 'featurette', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'Somebody', 'parting', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'begin', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', '[', 'probably', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'win', 'genre', 'do', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'even', 'just', 'have', 'thing', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'worth', 'seeing', ""n't"", 'best', ""'d"", 'advise', 'renting', 'first', 'decide', 'really', 'not']",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

This one is no exception, it's cheesy, unbelievable, but still entertaining!Andie Anderson writes a How-To column for a popular magazine.  Her newest assignment is to do everything women normally do to drive men away from relationships.  She's just got to find a mark to practice this on.  Which makes it hilarious when she encounters Benjamin Barry, an ad executive who won't get an assignment to sell diamonds unless he can prove to his boss he knows how to make a woman fall in love with him (there is a tie-in that explains this random requirement).  So the two unwittingly pair together to try to achieve both their goals which results in much hilarity.Characters:Kate Hudson as Andie AndersonMatthew McConaughey as Benjamin BarryKathryn Hahn as MichelleAnnie Parisse as JeannieAdam Goldberg as TonyThomas Lennon as ThayerMichael Michele as Judy SpearsShalom Harlow as Judy GreenRobert Klein as Phillip WarrenBebe Neuwirth as Lana JangMarvin Hamlisch as Himself (Cameo)I thought that all of the actors were well cast.  They were funny, smooth, and performed their lines nicely.  McConaughey and Hudson had good chemistry and actually made a very cute couple.  I could almost believe that they were real people.  I did think they both took it a little over the top at times, but seeing as this is a comedy of the romantic persuasion that's not really surprising.  It's probably a requirement.The whole plot is hard to believe.  And relies heavily on coincidence, but the way the plot is carried out is cute.  You have these two people forced into something for the job, and yet they can't help but be attracted to each other despite knowing that it isn't going to last.  And the pranks that Andie played on Ben, well some of those were truly inspired.  It won't be the type of show for people who don't enjoy romantic comedies though.  Because it definitely fits the category.  There's no action, no serious conversation, no sword fights.  It's just romance and a little bit of karaoke.Cute movie, but not for everyone.  But if you like funny, it's probably a good one to watch.Review by M.

744288,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,B00008KDGZ,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[1, 1]","""How To Loose a Guy in 10 Days,"" despite it's somewhat morally disturbing premise is an enjoyable film.  Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson have great chemistry on-screen and the supporting cast does an awesome job of telling this somewhat simple, yet oddly enough sweet, story.THE STORY:Andie Anderson (Hudson), a rising journalist for women's magazine Composure is assigned to write an article on ""How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days"" whereby she is to date some poor fellow and attempt to drive him off within 10 days.In order to secure a lucrative account, Advertising account executive Ben Barry makes a bet with his boss that he can make any woman fall in love with him in 10 days.Through some slight manipulation both Andie and Ben wind up hooked up with each other and seek to achieve both their ends, she to drive him off in 10 days, he to win her over.  Hilarity ensues as Andie seeks to drive Ben away while Ben struggles to cling onto the ever (seemingly) increasingly illogical Andie.THE COOL STUFF:While the premise of both Andie and Ben merely using each other for their own ends can be a little off-putting, the execution of the story is flawless and really enjoyable.  The situations that Andie and Ben and their cast of friends get themselves into are hilarious and the tender moments that Ben and Andie share (particularly when they visit Ben's family) are just really enjoyable moments.  Overall, it's just a nice film to have a good laugh and an ""awwwww"" moment at.Best Scenes:1. Visit to Ben's folks2. The Poker GameTHE DVD FEATURES:Much like the film itself, the DVD features are a little sparse in variety, but very deep in content.  Truly, the amount of features, more than many other DVDs put out, offer strong insight and background on the film and are alone well worth the DVD purchase.  For your viewing and listening pleasure on this DVD are:1. Director's Commentary track:  Standard fare, but always insightful2. ""Mapping the Perfect Movie"" - These are a series of approximately 4 minute featurettes talking about each member of the cast and crew where they talk about each actor/filmmaker talking about things such as casting or working with each other.  Great stuff overall and easily outshines the standard ""actor/filmmaker biography/filmography we usually get.3. 5 deleted scenes with optional director commentary track4. ""Mapping the Perfect Location"" - Much like ""Mapping the Perfect Movie"" these are approximately 4 minute individual featurettes discussing each of the major sets used in this movie.  You'll get insights into how the sets were either built or selected including the scene scouting process used in film-making.  Again, great stuff overall.5. Music video - ""Somebody Like You"" by Keith Urban.  Standard fair.  Nice country influenced track with some great footage from the film and band.6. 3 trailersTHE VERDICT:Overall, ""How To Loose A Guy in 10 Days"" is just a nice romantic comedy.  Again, the premise built on deception is a little disturbing but the execution in this movie is just flawless.  The humor and hilarious situations our cast find themselves in our witty and brilliant and the metamorphosis of Andie and Ben's relationship into true love is just beautifully done.  This makes a great watch for couples who need a nice laugh.  The insight DVD extras make this a fine choice for purchase if you are so inclined.Grades:The Movie:  4 starsThe Extras:  5 starsOverall:  4.5 starsHighly Recommended",5,Funny and Nice,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,3455,"['How', 'Loose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'somewhat', 'morally', 'disturbing', 'premise', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'on-screen', 'supporting', 'cast', 'awesome', 'job', 'telling', 'somewhat', 'simple', 'yet', 'oddly', 'enough', 'sweet', 'story.THE', 'STORY', 'Andie', 'Anderson', 'Hudson', 'rising', 'journalist', 'women', 'magazine', 'Composure', 'assigned', 'write', 'article', 'How', 'Lose', 'A', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'whereby', 'date', 'poor', 'fellow', 'attempt', 'drive', 'off', '10', 'days.In', 'order', 'secure', 'lucrative', 'account', 'Advertising', 'account', 'executive', 'Ben', 'Barry', 'bet', 'boss', 'can', 'make', 'woman', 'fall', 'love', '10', 'slight', 'manipulation', 'Andie', 'Ben', 'wind', 'up', 'hooked', 'up', 'other', 'seek', 'achieve', 'ends', 'drive', 'off', '10', 'days', 'win', 'over', 'Hilarity', 'Andie', 'drive', 'Ben', 'away', 'Ben', 'cling', 'ever', 'seemingly', 'increasingly', 'illogical', 'Andie.THE', 'COOL', 'STUFF', 'premise', 'Andie', 'Ben', 'merely', 'using', 'other', 'own', 'ends', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'off-putting', 'execution', 'story', 'flawless', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'situations', 'Andie', 'Ben', 'cast', 'friends', 'get', 'are', 'hilarious', 'tender', 'moments', 'Ben', 'Andie', 'share', 'particularly', 'when', 'visit', 'Ben', 'family', 'are', 'just', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'Overall', 'just', 'nice', 'film', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', 'awwwww', 'moment', 'at.Best', 'Scenes:1', 'Visit', 'Ben', 'folks2', 'Poker', 'GameTHE', 'DVD', 'FEATURES', 'Much', 'film', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'little', 'sparse', 'variety', 'very', 'deep', 'content', 'Truly', 'amount', 'features', 'more', 'many', 'other', 'DVDs', 'put', 'out', 'offer', 'strong', 'insight', 'background', 'film', 'are', 'alone', 'well', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'viewing', 'listening', 'pleasure', 'DVD', 'are:1', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'track', 'Standard', 'fare', 'always', 'insightful2', 'Mapping', 'Perfect', 'Movie', 'are', 'series', 'approximately', '4', 'minute', 'featurettes', 'talking', 'member', 'cast', 'crew', 'where', 'talk', 'actor/filmmaker', 'talking', 'things', 'such', 'casting', 'working', 'other', 'Great', 'stuff', 'overall', 'easily', 'standard', 'actor/filmmaker', 'biography/filmography', 'usually', 'get.3', '5', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary', 'track4', 'Mapping', 'Perfect', 'Location', 'Much', 'Mapping', 'Perfect', 'Movie', 'are', 'approximately', '4', 'minute', 'individual', 'featurettes', 'discussing', 'major', 'sets', 'used', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'insights', 'how', 'sets', 'were', 'either', 'built', 'selected', 'including', 'scene', 'scouting', 'process', 'used', 'film-making', 'Again', 'great', 'stuff', 'overall.5', 'Music', 'video', 'Somebody', 'Keith', 'Urban', 'Standard', 'fair', 'Nice', 'country', 'influenced', 'track', 'great', 'footage', 'film', 'band.6', '3', 'trailersTHE', 'VERDICT', 'Overall', 'How', 'Loose', 'A', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'just', 'nice', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Again', 'premise', 'built', 'deception', 'little', 'disturbing', 'execution', 'movie', 'just', 'flawless', 'humor', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'cast', 'find', 'witty', 'brilliant', 'metamorphosis', 'Andie', 'Ben', 'relationship', 'true', 'love', 'just', 'beautifully', 'done', 'great', 'watch', 'couples', 'who', 'need', 'nice', 'laugh', 'insight', 'DVD', 'extras', 'make', 'fine', 'choice', 'purchase', 'are', 'so', 'inclined.Grades', 'Movie', '4', 'starsThe', 'Extras', '5', 'starsOverall', '4.5', 'starsHighly', 'Recommended']",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

The rest of the movie is Kate Hudson doing everything she can to be annoying (she succeeds with flying colors!) and Matthew doing everything in his power to be a sweet, sensitive, and understanding boyfriend to try to make her fall for him. There are funny parts, and there are also extremely predictable and dull parts. But, the movie is saved by the acting of both Kate Hudson (who is too cute for words) and Matthew M. (um, hello? sexy as hell) I liked it. Not the best comedy of the year, but definitely worth watching. I think it makes a pretty good date movie, since there is the romance and girl humor for the girls, and guy humor for the guys.",4,Saved by the actors,1068249600,"11 8, 2003",2003,1335,"['Would', 'have', 'given', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'option', 'was', 'available.Kate', 'Hudson', 'aspiring', 'journalist', 'who', 'assigned', 'job', 'less-than-serious-journalism-beauty-magazine', 'called', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'assignment', 'Find', 'poor', 'unexpecting', 'schmuck', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'overnight', 'then', 'do', 'annoying', 'little', 'stereotypical', 'quirks', 'girls', 'do', 'push', 'guys', 'away', 'must', 'get', 'rid', '10', 'days', 'Matthew', 'M.', 'egotistical', 'womanizing', 'guy', 'who', 'bet', 'friends', 'can', 'make', 'poor', 'unexpecting', 'girl', 'fall', 'love', '10', 'days', 'What', 'coincedence', '-shocker', 'two', 'meet', 'Yeah', 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'either', 'rest', 'movie', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'flying', 'colors', 'Matthew', 'doing', 'everything', 'power', 'be', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'understanding', 'boyfriend', 'try', 'make', 'fall', 'are', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'dull', 'parts', 'movie', 'saved', 'acting', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'too', 'cute', 'words', 'Matthew', 'M.', 'um', 'hello', 'sexy', 'hell', 'liked', 'Not', 'best', 'comedy', 'year', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'date', 'movie', 'romance', 'girl', 'humor', 'girls', 'guy', 'humor', 'guys']",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

Against my better judgment I decided to check out this 'romantic comedy', a genre that has become a breeding ground for garbage in the past 20 years or so.Should have known better.  If we want to call romantic comedies genre films, then this has all the pieces.  And like many genre films these days, it sucks, made of half-baked ideas or the same old ingredients baked to nauseating results.  Here's a movie about two people you would never know: he works at a super cool ad agency and has the type of office no one you know has, she works at a Cosmo-like magazine writing vapid columns for vapid people in a vapid office.  They both make bets with their respective bosses: he'll get a girl to fall in love with him in 10 days, and she'll get a guy to dump her in 10.  Want an easy solution to lose someone in a weekend?  Start here.The characters are happy, beautiful people living in impossibly large Manhattan apartments in your typical romantic comedy New York (which means full of rich, pretty people and none of the grit of the real city).  They make a bet that they can basically ruin someone for the sake of their jobs, both of which are appropriately hollow professions (he is trying to sell diamonds to more women, she is doing columns for your typical New York society ice queen boss).  Of course this means we'll see him be the nicest guy on the planet (cooking, court side Knicks tickets )for her while she tries to make his life a living hell (buying a puntable little dog who does his business on the man's pool table, interrupting his poker night, etc.) But of course, he has to try and work it out as his job depends on it.  Meanwhile most men would have booted her and the dog in a jiffy.The movie flat out insulted my intelligence.  It has the obligatory scene where he takes her to his humble beginnings, which in this case is Staten Island, a place they want to portray as more down to earth, romantic, homey, etc.  Blah.  Kate Hudson may be nice to look at but she has none of her mother's famous expressions and in general, she has about half the talent. Matthew Mc-whatever is his same down-home nice guy.Romantic comedies do not have to be this sappy and cheesy and insulting.  Movies like this border on contempt for audiences. Who can relate to these characters?  Who cares in the end?  I guess it's a safe investment for a studio.  Avoid, unless you want to lose more respect for Hollywood in two hours.  And if you're stuck on a plane, ask for a gin and tonic and go to sleep.",1,Or How to Lose Your Lunch in Two Hours,1065571200,"10 8, 2003",2003,2615,"['Why', 'review', 'movie', 'simple', 'reason', 'was', 'stuck', 'airplane', 'hours', 'nothing', 'do', 'Against', 'better', 'judgment', 'decided', 'check', 'out', ""'romantic"", 'comedy', 'genre', 'become', 'breeding', 'ground', 'garbage', 'past', '20', 'years', 'so.Should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'want', 'call', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'genre', 'films', 'then', 'pieces', 'many', 'genre', 'films', 'days', 'made', 'half-baked', 'ideas', 'same', 'old', 'ingredients', 'baked', 'nauseating', 'results', 'Here', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'super', 'cool', 'ad', 'agency', 'type', 'office', 'one', 'know', 'Cosmo-like', 'magazine', 'writing', 'vapid', 'columns', 'vapid', 'people', 'vapid', 'office', 'make', 'bets', 'respective', 'bosses', ""'ll"", 'get', 'girl', 'fall', 'love', '10', 'days', ""'ll"", 'get', 'guy', 'dump', '10', 'Want', 'easy', 'solution', 'lose', 'someone', 'weekend', 'Start', 'here.The', 'characters', 'are', 'happy', 'beautiful', 'people', 'living', 'impossibly', 'large', 'Manhattan', 'apartments', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'New', 'York', 'full', 'rich', 'pretty', 'people', 'none', 'grit', 'real', 'city', 'make', 'bet', 'can', 'basically', 'ruin', 'someone', 'sake', 'jobs', 'are', 'appropriately', 'hollow', 'professions', 'trying', 'sell', 'diamonds', 'more', 'women', 'doing', 'columns', 'typical', 'New', 'York', 'society', 'ice', 'queen', 'boss', 'course', ""'ll"", 'see', 'be', 'nicest', 'guy', 'planet', 'cooking', 'court', 'side', 'Knicks', 'tickets', 'make', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'buying', 'puntable', 'little', 'dog', 'who', 'business', 'man', 'pool', 'table', 'interrupting', 'poker', 'night', 'etc', 'course', 'try', 'work', 'out', 'job', 'Meanwhile', 'most', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'booted', 'dog', 'jiffy.The', 'movie', 'flat', 'out', 'insulted', 'intelligence', 'obligatory', 'scene', 'where', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'case', 'Staten', 'Island', 'place', 'want', 'portray', 'more', 'earth', 'romantic', 'homey', 'etc', 'Blah', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'may', 'be', 'nice', 'look', 'none', 'mother', 'famous', 'expressions', 'general', 'about', 'talent', 'Matthew', 'Mc-whatever', 'same', 'down-home', 'nice', 'guy.Romantic', 'comedies', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'sappy', 'cheesy', 'insulting', 'Movies', 'border', 'contempt', 'audiences', 'Who', 'can', 'relate', 'characters', 'Who', 'end', 'guess', 'safe', 'investment', 'studio', 'Avoid', 'want', 'lose', 'more', 'respect', 'Hollywood', 'two', 'hours', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'plane', 'ask', 'gin', 'tonic', 'go', 'sleep']",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

So if you want to go to the movies with your friends, you typically wind up watching what their wives want to see. This is how I was roped into seeing ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"".  This film has one thing going for it (and only one thing): Kate Hudson is hilarious playing the psycho girlfriend (and I've had a couple). Unfortunately, that might be enough for a 5-minute SNL skit or a guest appearance on a show like ""Friends"", but it's not enough to carry a 2-hour movie.  Everything else in the film comes from the sitcom ""Just Shoot Me"": Kate Hudson's character is a serious journalist ""trapped"" working at a shallow fashion magazine, and the characters played by Bebe Neuwirth & Robert Klein are carbon copies of Wendie Malick & George Segal respectively in the aforementioned TV show.  The ""plot""--so to speak--is that Hudson's character is going to pick a guy to clamp on to, then drive him away with all the stuff that women do when they feel more needy than desirable, after which she will write an article called ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"". Meanwhile an ad exec (Matthew McConaughey, who I met a couple of times when we were in college together) bets his co-workers he can get anyone to fall in love with him. They pick each other for their respective projects and the bad chick-flick comedy cliches ensue.  Another big problem I have with the movie is that it has nothing to do with the real world. Since when are the Knicks in the NBA finals each year? That hasn't happened since Jeff Van Gundy left. Also, as a Texan, I have come to accept that my accent is used for all sorts of rural types (Ohio in ""Heathers"", Alaska in ""Northern Exposure"", Minnesota in ""A Simple Plan""); and I realize that in the movies, everywhere outside of New York City proper is supposed to be the sticks. But surely even the most elitist Manhattanite must realize that people from Staten Island do *not* speak with an exaggerated Southern drawl.  For a single heterosexual male, watching this movie is like waiting for your sister to finish trying on outfits at a department store when you were a kid. You just wanted her to hurry up so you could go home and play video games.

744309,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00008KDGZ,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","What a nice surprise this film is! It is a situational romantic comedy, and so a bit predictable (though I should add that unpredictibility in a formula picture like this is NOT a desirable quality), but the situation works, and the two leads enjoy a great chemistry together.The situation is far-fetched but clever. A woman intending to write an article entitled ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" meets a guy who has just bet that he can make any woman fall in love with him before a party in 10 days. Thus yoked improbably to one another, the guy who is forced to stay with the woman puts up with behavior that the woman is certain must drive him away, but doesn't. The trick in such a plot is to find a way for the two to fall in love despite her appalling behavior, and the movie does this deftly. There are a couple of false notes along the way, such as a dreadful rendition in front of a room of people of ""You're So Vain,"" but so many moments are so right that I had no trouble forgiving them the few missteps.I have never disliked Matthew McConaughey, but neither have I been a big fan. He was, however, far more enjoyable in this one than in any other I have seen him in. But the star of the film is without any question Kate Hudson. She is one of those rare screen personalities you can't take your eyes off the entire time she is onscreen. I love her mother as well, but she has none of her mother's cartoonish wackiness, though much of her charm and energy.

744330,A9OVXY24IY777,B00008KDGZ,"""velurion""","[4, 4]","It's my own fault that I had higher expectations of this film, but I'm guessing that this movie was not exactly made for guys like me anyway. The acting is ok, Matthew McConaughey's character Ben and Kate Hudson's Andie really just have to act and react. The dialog doesn't matter. Kate Hudson's character always has the upperhand, which is fine for a while, but after an hour it gets tiring. She completely invades every aspect of Ben's life; we never even see Andie's world besides her two friends and workplace. So while both characters have a similar agenda, there is a complete imbalance of upperhandedness, and this to me is the film's greatest shortcoming. He puts up with all her attempts in 'losing him', but all this only produces frustration in Andie - and fuels her to do crazier things. As a viewer you're dying to see her fall on her face just once. But that's wishful thinking. Ben's resilience to Andie's antics barely entertains me, and Andie's total lack of shame does not endear her to me. Sure they both look great, and Hudson positively beams when she smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to endure this game.I can imagine some people thinking this movie is great. Girl Power and all. I don't know. But I think we can agree the movie was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson's rise to stardom.This movie reminds me a bit of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons but notably because it was written & produced by women - which in the male-dominated movie world is a much needed perspective - but Nancy Myers (the producer/director of What Women Want) is definitely a lot smarter than the 'brains' behind How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days. You only have to watch the DVD extras to see proof of this. We meet two of the producers, both of whom have obviously had facelifts. I'm serious. It's creepy. They talk about the material like it's Shakespeare. Then there is the director Donald Petrie, who totally lacks any charisma whatsoever. The MAKING OF with him is so cheaply done it's probably funnier to watch than most of the movie. While he sits there chatting, a TV monitor behind him fires off stills from the film, and a female office clerk (with her back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen while biting her nails and shaking her head a lot. She does this for the entire duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It's department store music. Or elevator music. Which ever one you hate more.I didn't bother with the commentary. Donald is a bore.There are no outtakes, which is by now unusual for a comedy.The deleted scenes are actually good, some honest emotions are shown by Andie and we get a few more calm private moments between the two leads.Look, it started off ok. It felt like it would be harmless fluffy romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can sum up my review with this observation of director Petrie's reason he became interested in directing the movie. He says it was because he found out that Kate Hudson was attached to it. Aha. So basically, if the movie does well at the box office, then it will launch Hudson's AND his career. Sorry Petrie, but that's not good enough for me.",2,How to annoy a guy over the course of 112 minutes,1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,3242,"['own', 'fault', 'had', 'higher', 'expectations', 'film', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'made', 'guys', 'anyway', 'acting', 'ok', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'character', 'Ben', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Andie', 'really', 'just', 'have', 'act', 'react', 'dialog', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'character', 'always', 'upperhand', 'fine', 'while', 'hour', 'tiring', 'completely', 'aspect', 'Ben', 'life', 'never', 'even', 'see', 'Andie', 'world', 'two', 'friends', 'workplace', 'So', 'characters', 'have', 'similar', 'agenda', 'complete', 'imbalance', 'upperhandedness', 'film', 'greatest', 'shortcoming', 'up', 'attempts', ""'losing"", 'only', 'frustration', 'Andie', 'fuels', 'do', 'crazier', 'things', 'viewer', ""'re"", 'dying', 'see', 'fall', 'face', 'just', 'once', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'Ben', 'resilience', 'Andie', 'antics', 'barely', 'Andie', 'total', 'lack', 'shame', 'not', 'endear', 'Sure', 'look', 'great', 'Hudson', 'positively', 'beams', 'when', 'man', '112', 'minutes', 'long', 'time', 'endure', 'game.I', 'can', 'imagine', 'people', 'thinking', 'movie', 'great', 'Girl', 'Power', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'can', 'agree', 'movie', 'was', 'conceived', 'vehicle', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'rise', 'stardom.This', 'movie', 'bit', 'WHAT', 'WOMEN', 'WANT', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'variety', 'reasons', 'notably', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'women', 'male-dominated', 'movie', 'world', 'much', 'needed', 'perspective', 'Nancy', 'Myers', 'producer/director', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'definitely', 'lot', 'smarter', ""'brains"", 'How', 'Lose', 'A', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'only', 'have', 'watch', 'DVD', 'extras', 'see', 'proof', 'meet', 'two', 'producers', 'whom', 'have', 'obviously', 'had', 'facelifts', ""'m"", 'serious', 'creepy', 'talk', 'material', 'Shakespeare', 'Then', 'director', 'Donald', 'Petrie', 'who', 'totally', 'charisma', 'whatsoever', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'so', 'cheaply', 'done', 'probably', 'funnier', 'watch', 'most', 'movie', 'there', 'chatting', 'TV', 'monitor', 'off', 'stills', 'film', 'female', 'office', 'clerk', 'back', 'camera', 'static', 'PC', 'screen', 'biting', 'nails', 'shaking', 'head', 'lot', 'entire', 'duration', 'interviews', 'Petrie', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'background', 'music', 'extras', 'department', 'store', 'music', 'elevator', 'music', 'Which', 'ever', 'one', 'hate', 'more.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'commentary', 'Donald', 'are', 'outtakes', 'now', 'unusual', 'comedy.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'honest', 'emotions', 'are', 'shown', 'Andie', 'get', 'few', 'more', 'calm', 'private', 'moments', 'two', 'leads.Look', 'started', 'off', 'ok', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'harmless', 'fluffy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romance', 'lasted', '10', 'minutes', 'can', 'sum', 'up', 'review', 'observation', 'director', 'Petrie', 'reason', 'became', 'interested', 'directing', 'movie', 'was', 'found', 'out', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'was', 'attached', 'Aha', 'So', 'basically', 'movie', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'then', 'will', 'launch', 'Hudson', 'AND', 'career', 'Sorry', 'Petrie', 'not', 'good', 'enough']",How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

She is engagingly funny as she talks baby talk, brings over a suitcase full of stuffed animals and carries around a silly toy dog during her 1 week relationship. But despite all her clingy, controlling stupidity she still gets the guy because it is a movie after all.Matthew McConaughey is his usual gorgeous self playing an ad exec who tries to bag a deal by making a woman fall in love with him, instead of the diamonds in his ad. I imagine this would not be too hard....but the movie makes it out to be.

It's one of those movies where you think to yourself, ""it was so much more entertaining the first time around..."" not to say it wasn't at all entertaining, it was! Just, you know...Andie is a columnist for a female magazine (is it just me or do most chick-flicks have a character that lives in NY and writes for a magazine/works in fashion?) writing ""how to's"" and she wants more. She's got the qualifications and smarts to write things that matter but as in any job like that she has to write what her boss wants, not what she wants. So she takes up an assignment after her fellow co-worker gets dumped using her as an inspiration -- ""How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days"" -- by doing the annoying things girls do to drive guys away.Ben works in marketing and while he's good at what he does, he too wants to break into a new brand of marketing.

It's a set up from the beginning.While this is suppose to be a ""rom-com"" (I guess) I didn't really catch the ""com"" part of it. I get that Andie was on a tight timeline to get Ben to break up with her within ten days but I think some of the things she did was a bit much and over the top. She was way beyond the ""annoying"" and straight into ""SHESAPSYCHORUNBENRUN"". When they were being normal people in a normal relationship however, they worked.
