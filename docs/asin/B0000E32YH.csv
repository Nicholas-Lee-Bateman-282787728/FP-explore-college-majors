Man dies, and leaves behind a film documentary that he secretly taped of all his friends in their real and private moments. It his wish that they all watch the film together at the funeral.And then the fun & chaos begin...How carefully Sadie, Jude's widow, sits there studying each face in the room as each friend is revealed in their naked and raw moments.  As each ugly truth is pranced on the screen for all to see.But Sadie never gives anything away.Ray Winstone (SEXY BEAST) taught me a whole slew of new Cockney curses.",5,Finger Sandwiches...,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,586,"['Jude', 'Law', 'Nuff', 'said.But', 'really', 'what', 'bizarrely', 'made', 'film', 'Man', 'film', 'documentary', 'secretly', 'taped', 'friends', 'real', 'private', 'moments', 'wish', 'watch', 'film', 'together', 'funeral.And', 'then', 'fun', 'chaos', 'begin', 'How', 'carefully', 'Sadie', 'Jude', 'widow', 'there', 'studying', 'face', 'room', 'friend', 'revealed', 'naked', 'raw', 'moments', 'ugly', 'truth', 'pranced', 'screen', 'see.But', 'Sadie', 'never', 'anything', 'away.Ray', 'Winstone', 'SEXY', 'BEAST', 'taught', 'whole', 'slew', 'new', 'Cockney', 'curses']",N/A

Gibbs,"[1, 2]","I am moved to write a review out of frustration that a movie with a promising premise and a charismatic lead actor can turn out so...all I can think of is a dead fish....cold, useless and sort of stinky.Interesting premise, but defies any sort of logic. So Jude begins the film...why? It certainly sounds like he wants it to be seen after he dies. But his death is an accident. His narrative sounds like a man mulling over his mortality. But his death is an accident. So why was he making a movie like this? Coincidence? HUH? No logic. And so his wife, Sadie (5 stars for Bad Acting Hall of Famer Sadie Frost...man, she is just uncomfortably laughably bad) finishes his film? It is implausible in the extreme.She calls the cops...when...? ...to catch Ray as he makes his exit? Is she clairvoyant? Lame. As if the cops would wait for her to set all this up. No. And they send what amounts to a SWAT team. HUH?But. A side note. Anything with Ray Winstone is worth watching. Even this. But just for his crackling, pent-up, electric energy. He is scary and beguiling and you don't really take your eyes off him for a moment. He swears creatively, admirably and with great enthusiasm. I was nearly taking notes.He is worth seeking out in anything. Amazing, under-the-radar actor.Awful film.

From beyond the grave, Jude Law narrates and shows a film of his friends to his friends. They are shown as cowards, cheats, petty criminals, adulterers and ultimately murderers. The end is a shocker. The acting superb,  in that ""fly on the wall"" documentary style. Ray Whinstone steals most of his scenes.

Still, it was very slow-moving and even though Ray Whinstone was very good and Jude Law looked as hot as ever, there wasn't much else to hold my attention.  The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion.  So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-(",2,A little disappointed...,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,726,"['Am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'Sure', 'was', 'original', 'idea', 'revelation', 'how', 'Jude', 'died', 'was', 'surprising', 'say', 'least', 'Still', 'was', 'very', 'slow-moving', 'even', 'Ray', 'Whinstone', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Jude', 'Law', 'looked', 'as', 'hot', 'ever', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'hold', 'attention', 'female', 'all', 'acted', 'were', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'read', 'lines', 'Sadie', 'Frost', 'opinion', 'was', 'terrible', 'Surely', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'actresses', 'who', 'would', 'show', 'little', 'emotion', 'seem', 'sincere', 'when', 'did', 'show', 'little', 'emotion', 'So', 'give', 'film', 'kudos', 'such', 'original', 'idea', 'unique', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'presented', 'otherwise', 'have', 'give', 'two', 'thumbs']",N/A
