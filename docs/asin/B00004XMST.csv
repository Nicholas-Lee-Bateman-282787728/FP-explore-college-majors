556414,AV2Q16LYHBRP0,B00004XMST,1800's Lady at heart,"[2, 2]","I have loved this movie since I saw it on cable a long time ago.  I have never gotten it out of my head.  I have searched for a DVD for a long time and I am so very happy to find it now.  I ran across the book ""Letters of a Woman Homesteader"" in a used bookstore and when I picked up the book and started looking through it, I was instantly aware this was the book the movie was taken from.  Of course I purchesed the book and took it home and it has become one of my very favorite books.  I love this movie and it's portrail of life on a Wyoming homestead in the early 1900's.  What an impressive movie.  Ms. Farrell and Mr. Torn have done an excellent job in reaching inside your heart and pulling on those heartstrings.  They did a wonderful job.  If you are looking for a movie that portrays life in the west in the early 1900's, I think this would be as close as it gets.  You will love it.",5,Heartland,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,895,"['have', 'loved', 'movie', 'saw', 'cable', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'never', 'gotten', 'head', 'have', 'searched', 'DVD', 'long', 'time', 'am', 'so', 'very', 'happy', 'find', 'now', 'ran', 'book', 'Letters', 'Woman', 'Homesteader', 'used', 'bookstore', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'book', 'started', 'looking', 'was', 'instantly', 'aware', 'was', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'taken', 'course', 'purchesed', 'book', 'took', 'home', 'become', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'books', 'love', 'movie', 'portrail', 'life', 'Wyoming', 'homestead', 'early', '1900', 'What', 'impressive', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Farrell', 'Mr.', 'Torn', 'have', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'reaching', 'heart', 'pulling', 'heartstrings', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'life', 'west', 'early', '1900', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'close', 'will', 'love']",N/A
556415,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00004XMST,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 22]","I realize that living in the Western Plains of Wyoming during the 1900s was brutal, in fact, it probably is still brutal today, but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly ""made-for-TV"" movie?  Also, women's rights were still budding in this nation during this time, so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory, and still show the realism of the era ... would it make for good viewing?  Honestly, I don't know.  I have thought about this film for the past two days, and I still can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film, yet I can truthfully tell you that it wasn't the greatest I have ever seen.  From several hodgepodge styles of acting, to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character, to some of the most gruesome PG rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema, it is hard to fully get a good grasp on Heartland.  Was it good?  Was it bad?  That may be up for you to view and decide yourself, but until then, here are moments I enjoyed and desperately hated!This film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes.  Scenes where I wasn't sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed, but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole.  I thought the story as a whole was a very interesting, historical tale.  I do not know much about living in Wyoming, especially during the early 1900s, so this film captured that image in my mind.  The thought of very cold winters, no neighbors for miles upon miles, and this Polaroid-esque view untouched by corporate America.  It was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience (though the television).  There were scenes that really stood out in my mind, like the cattle-branding scene, the pig slaughtering scene, and the saddening homesteader that didn't survive their journey, that just brought a true sense of realism to this story.  Director Richard Pearce did a great job of bringing the view of Wyoming to the viewers, but I am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view.While I will constantly compliment the scenery of this film, I had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side.  Rip Torn seemed out of place in his role as Clyde Stewart, a loner that somehow finds a connection with Conchata Ferrell's Elinore Randall.  The two as actors have no chemistry at all.  Their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion.  The pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two ""veteran"" actors portrayed it.  The brave Elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her, while Clyde gives an approving nod when she is done.  This is love?  Was it supposed to be love?  I don't know, I think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond, but with Torn and Ferrell, it felt like two actors just playing their parts.  Other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse ""knocks"" on the door for food or shelter, the constantly fading and growing compassion that Clyde had for Elinore's daughter (I just didn't believe it), the lack of true winter struggle, and the entire land scene.  The land scene especially because I needed more explanation on what Elinore was doing, why she was doing it, and why Clyde would build her a house if they were married!  It was these simple events that if taken the time to explore, would have made for a stronger film.Overall, I will go middle of the road with this feature.  There were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper, such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of Elinore, but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation.  These panoramic scenes which, in the span of 100 years, have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers.  While there were some brilliant scenes of realism (starring cattle and pigs), I just felt as if we needed more.  Depth was a key element lacking in this film, which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story.  Pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world, but instead left open loopholes and clich&eacute;d Western characters.  Ferrell carried her own, but Torn was completely miscast.  Decent for a viewing, but will not be picked up again by me.Grade: ** out of *****",2,"""MMMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"", says the cow.",1123891200,"08 13, 2005",2005,4475,"['realize', 'living', 'Western', 'Plains', 'Wyoming', '1900s', 'was', 'brutal', 'fact', 'probably', 'still', 'brutal', 'today', 'was', 'monumental', 'enough', 'transform', 'seemingly', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Also', 'women', 'rights', 'were', 'still', 'budding', 'nation', 'time', 'so', 'find', 'independent', 'woman', 'determined', 'start', 'fresh', 'harsh', 'territory', 'still', 'show', 'realism', 'era', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'viewing', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'thought', 'film', 'past', 'two', 'days', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'muster', 'strength', 'say', 'was', 'horrible', 'film', 'yet', 'can', 'truthfully', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'several', 'hodgepodge', 'styles', 'acting', 'two', 'mismatched', 'actors', 'playing', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'character', 'most', 'gruesome', 'PG', 'rated', 'scenes', 'ever', 'come', 'late', '70s', 'cinema', 'hard', 'fully', 'get', 'good', 'grasp', 'Heartland', 'Was', 'good', 'Was', 'bad', 'may', 'be', 'up', 'view', 'decide', 'then', 'here', 'are', 'moments', 'enjoyed', 'desperately', 'hated', 'film', 'be', 'struggle', 'mind', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'Scenes', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'doing', 'direction', 'was', 'headed', 'somehow', 'still', 'seemed', 'work', 'well', 'whole', 'thought', 'story', 'whole', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'historical', 'tale', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'living', 'Wyoming', 'especially', 'early', '1900s', 'so', 'film', 'captured', 'image', 'mind', 'thought', 'very', 'cold', 'winters', 'neighbors', 'miles', 'miles', 'Polaroid-esque', 'view', 'untouched', 'corporate', 'America', 'was', 'refreshing', 'witness', 'sheer', 'breathtaking', 'experience', 'television', 'were', 'scenes', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'mind', 'cattle-branding', 'scene', 'pig', 'slaughtering', 'scene', 'saddening', 'homesteader', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'journey', 'just', 'brought', 'true', 'sense', 'realism', 'story', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Pearce', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'view', 'Wyoming', 'viewers', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'brought', 'decent', 'players', 'accompany', 'view.While', 'will', 'constantly', 'compliment', 'scenery', 'film', 'had', 'trouble', 'coping', 'actors', 'seemingly', 'walked', 'set', 'read', 'lines', 'cards', 'side', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'seemed', 'place', 'role', 'Clyde', 'Stewart', 'loner', 'somehow', 'connection', 'Conchata', 'Ferrell', 'Elinore', 'Randall', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'share', 'together', 'are', 'pointless', 'honestly', 'void', 'emotion', 'pregnancy', 'scene', 'nearly', 'had', 'stitches', 'way', 'two', 'veteran', 'actors', 'portrayed', 'brave', 'Elinore', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'child', 'Clyde', 'approving', 'nod', 'when', 'done', 'love', 'Was', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'stronger', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'stronger', 'bond', 'Torn', 'Ferrell', 'felt', 'two', 'actors', 'just', 'playing', 'parts', 'Other', 'scenes', 'just', 'seemed', 'struggle', 'mind', 'were', 'ones', 'when', 'frozen', 'horse', 'knocks', 'door', 'food', 'shelter', 'constantly', 'fading', 'growing', 'compassion', 'Clyde', 'had', 'Elinore', 'daughter', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'lack', 'true', 'winter', 'struggle', 'entire', 'land', 'scene', 'land', 'scene', 'especially', 'needed', 'more', 'explanation', 'what', 'Elinore', 'was', 'doing', 'why', 'was', 'doing', 'why', 'Clyde', 'would', 'build', 'house', 'were', 'married', 'was', 'simple', 'events', 'taken', 'time', 'explore', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'stronger', 'film.Overall', 'will', 'go', 'middle', 'road', 'feature', 'were', 'definitely', 'elements', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'deeper', 'such', 'relationship', 'two', 'strangers', 'ultimate', 'homesteading', 'goals', 'Elinore', 'were', 'countered', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'nation', 'panoramic', 'scenes', 'span', '100', 'years', 'have', 'changes', 'vast', 'mountains', 'enormous', 'skyscrapers', 'were', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'realism', 'starring', 'cattle', 'pigs', 'just', 'felt', 'needed', 'more', 'Depth', 'was', 'key', 'element', 'lacking', 'film', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'marginal', 'acting', 'diminishing', 'story', 'Pearce', 'could', 'have', 'dove', 'deeper', 'untapped', 'world', 'instead', 'left', 'open', 'loopholes', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Western', 'characters', 'Ferrell', 'carried', 'own', 'Torn', 'was', 'completely', 'miscast', 'Decent', 'viewing', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'again', 'me.Grade', '**', '*****']",N/A

A Scottish immigrant (played by Rip Torn) (he was born for the part) advertizes for a housekeeper in an eastern newspaper. Elinore Pruitt (Conchita Ferrel) (also perfectly casted) Answers the ad and comes west on the train with her 6 year old daughter.She's met in Burnt Forks by Clyde Stewart and told to go to the general store and order supplies. ""I'll be back in a half hour"" he says. Not a lot of chit chat in the way of introducing himself. That sets the tone of the story for awhile. Most of the film shows the everyday chores and tasks of living on a small ranch. Some might find this a boring film since it's not your everyday entertain me every minute film. They worked hard just to survive. It's amazing how much the world has changed since 1910. In some ways I envy them. But it was an awfully hard life. The winter was bitter cold. As the movie progresses Elinore claims the land next to Stewart and finds she can't keep up the land by herself so ends up marrying Stewart figuring between the two of them they can keep both places. There is not a lot of affection or hand holding between the two. They seem almost like strangers to each other but as time goes on you can tell there is love between them. People were much more reserved in those days. They have a baby boy but it dies during the winter. The feelings are kept inside and eventually Elinore breaks down while hanging up the laundry. She drops to the ground with a scream of anguish. And just as quickly is back to the laundry. Part of the way they were I guess. Most of the livestock is lost in the winter but in spring they start over. The last scene is of Clyde and Elinore helping a calf being born with a comealong and some rope by pulling the calf out of the cow. It appears to be a real calf being born.It's an abosultely wonderful film of the old days of a time long gone. I'm sorry its gone. Wonderfully filmed with wide open scenes of Wyoming in all seasons. Outstanding acting.
