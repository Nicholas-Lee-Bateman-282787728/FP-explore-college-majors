If you already have 2 or more of the seasons, I would wait for price drop or just buy the remaining seasons. The discs can be scratched easily as they fall out of the case but as long as you're careful, this shouldn't be that big of a deal.If you're a fan, this should be added to your collection.",5,Great series.,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,446,"['great', 'series', 'video', 'quality', 'good', ""'m"", 'expert', 'will', 'say', 'collection', 'individual', 'seasons', 'put', 'together', 'already', 'have', '2', 'more', 'seasons', 'would', 'wait', 'price', 'drop', 'just', 'buy', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'discs', 'can', 'be', 'scratched', 'easily', 'fall', 'case', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'careful', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'deal.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'collection']",Knight Rider Seasons 1 - 4 Bundle DVD Set
1019039,A29CJR2LAN3LJ0,B000I3MBNI,broctune,"[33, 37]","This appears to be a repackaging of the separate Knight Rider single season DVD sets.I have purchased sets from amazon that contain combined DVD seasons multiple times and I have never been disappointing. In general it appears that they are reducing current stock by lumping things together. With this you get a great price. On amazon each of these seasons originally retailed for almost 30 dollars. The box set cost almost 130 dollars at some point. Right now the box set can be purchased for $90!The main drawback to these bundles is that you do not get the fancy packaging that would be provided with the ""Knight Rider: The complete collection"" box set. The complete collection box set comes with a whimsical red bar that lights up and plays the theme song. This is actually very creative, especially if you need a large 80's showpiece for some reason. If somehow you are just looking to enjoy the episodes then you might want to consider this deal. It depends on whether or not a red flashing peice of plastic is worth $30 to you.This bundle of the seasons will take up less space on your shelf, but as i mentioned will be less flashy. The discs that come with this set are supposed to be with 24 dvds. From reading other reviews this implies that the discs are single sided which other reviewers have noted as being a bonus. Apparently, the double sided discs had some issues when it came to consistent quality. This means you should get 12 slim cases with two discs in each case.I feel that this is a worthwhile bundle if you love the show and you know what you are getting into.",5,worthwhile amazon bundle,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,1585,"['be', 'repackaging', 'separate', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'single', 'season', 'DVD', 'sets.I', 'have', 'purchased', 'sets', 'amazon', 'contain', 'combined', 'DVD', 'seasons', 'multiple', 'times', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'disappointing', 'general', 'are', 'reducing', 'current', 'stock', 'lumping', 'things', 'together', 'get', 'great', 'price', 'amazon', 'seasons', 'originally', 'retailed', 'almost', '30', 'dollars', 'box', 'set', 'cost', 'almost', '130', 'dollars', 'point', 'Right', 'now', 'box', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', '90', 'main', 'drawback', 'bundles', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'fancy', 'packaging', 'would', 'be', 'provided', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'complete', 'collection', 'box', 'set', 'complete', 'collection', 'box', 'set', 'whimsical', 'red', 'bar', 'up', 'theme', 'song', 'actually', 'very', 'creative', 'especially', 'need', 'large', '80', 'showpiece', 'reason', 'somehow', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'deal', 'not', 'red', 'flashing', 'peice', 'plastic', 'worth', '30', 'you.This', 'bundle', 'seasons', 'will', 'take', 'up', 'less', 'space', 'shelf', 'i', 'mentioned', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'flashy', 'discs', 'set', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', '24', 'dvds', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'discs', 'are', 'single', 'sided', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'being', 'bonus', 'Apparently', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'had', 'issues', 'when', 'came', 'consistent', 'quality', 'should', 'get', '12', 'slim', 'cases', 'two', 'discs', 'case.I', 'feel', 'worthwhile', 'bundle', 'love', 'show', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting']",Knight Rider Seasons 1 - 4 Bundle DVD Set

1019046,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000I3MBNI,Taheen Lopez,"[4, 14]","I loved this 1982-86 series about an artificially smart talking supercar with capabilities beyond imagination used to combat heavy-duty crime with the help of its pilot which was the reclusive freelance investigator Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff)who gets rescued by dying eccentric billionaire Wilton Knight(Richard Basehart)with a new identity after nearly being killed in the line of duty as former police detective Michael Long.The Foundation For Law & Government was headed by British overly concerned Devon Miles(Edward Mulhare)whom assigned Michael to cases involving criminals that the law couldn't touch.Dr. Bonnie Barstow(Patricia McPherson)was Devon's technical assistant and chief engineer technician in charge of KITT's maintenance, but was replaced by technician April Curtis(Rebecca Holden)in KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd Season in the Fall of 1983, but had returned to the show in the 3rd Season in the Fall of 1984.KNIGHT RIDER was also my favorite childhood show and it takes me all the way back to memory lane to when KNIGHT RIDER was the bomb and I used to watch it every Friday at 9PM after the short-lived THE POWERS OF MATTHEW STAR at 8PM when KITT was the hottest car on Friday nights from October of 1982 thru August of 1983 when it stole the Dukes thunder since KNIGHT RIDER KO'd THE DUKES OF HAZZARD in the ratings when KNIGHT RIDER debuted on NBC in September of 1982 on the same weekend CBS started THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's 5th Season with the new Dukes Coy(Byron Cherry)and Vance(Chris Mayer)since John Schneider(Bo)and Tom Wopat(Luke)left the show in the Spring of 1982, due to a salary dispute which also resulted in the Dukes getting a huge slump in ratings and losing lots of viewers thru KNIGHT RIDER, especially since the General Lee wasn't the hottest car for Friday nights anymore since the Knight 2000 outclassed the General, especially since KNIGHT RIDER's ratings were soaring at an all time high while THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's ratings were sinking at an all time low, but then Bo and Luke were brought back on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD in the Spring of 1983 and KNIGHT RIDER was moved to Sundays at 8PM in the Summer of 1983 which helped improve the Dukes ratings a little, despite the fact that KNIGHT RIDER still beat THE DUKES OF HAZZARD to a pulp.Additionally, KNIGHT RIDER was a pioneer in many ways, because for 1 thing KNIGHT RIDER was the first show in futuristic, high-tech vehicles since KNIGHT RIDER's debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 inspired the creation of the superchopper series AIRWOLF on CBS in the Winter of 1984 and the short-lived supercycle series STREET HAWK on ABC in the Winter of 1985 which by the way were all Universal distributions that were all filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City, despite the fact that KNIGHT RIDER, AIRWOLF, and STREET HAWK were all competitors and were all on rival networks since ABC had STREET HAWK on Fridays, CBS had AIRWOLF on Saturdays at 9PM, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER on Sundays at 8PM which eventually resulted in viewers getting too much of the same thing every weekend since AIRWOLF & STREET HAWK were too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER and had premiered not too long after one another which was probably why STREET HAWK tanked after only 10 weeks when ABC cancelled it in the Spring of 1985, despite the fact that STREET HAWK had stole KNIGHT RIDER's thunder which resulted in KNIGHT RIDER losing a lot of viewers thru STREET HAWK since the Knight 2000 was outclassed by the Street Hawk supercycle, so KITT was no longer the bomb or the hottest car on weekends anymore when STREET HAWK made its debut on Friday January 4, 1985.Unfortunately KNIGHT RIDER tanked after its 4-year run on NBC and was cancelled in the Summer of 1986, due to a nose-dive in ratings.Overall, I really don't understand why Universal feels such a need to re-release another Complete Series DVD box set of KNIGHT RIDER, especially in todays sluggish economy, especially since they already made and released one back in the Fall of 2008.",5,KITT Rocks!,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,4016,"['loved',
