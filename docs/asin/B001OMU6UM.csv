1222650,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001OMU6UM,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Bolt / B001OMU6UW*Spoilers*""Bolt"" opens smoothly, with the set-up presented (Bolt is the star of an action show, where he uses his super powers to protect his clever owner, Penny, not unlike a souped-up version of Brain fromInspector Gadget) vividly and amusingly as Bolt uses his 'super bark' to thoroughly decimate a onslaught of cars while Penny darts skillfully in and out of traffic. Of course, all this is just a television show, which we learn early on but which Bolt is not-so-blissfully unaware of.Then follows some exposition dialogue which is unfortunately ham-fisted and creates more problems than it solves. To wit: in order for the movie script to work, Bolt has to really believe that his television world is the real world. In order to explain this, the script writers opted to go for an eccentric director who has constructed Bolt's entire reality a laThe Truman Show. Unfortunately, about five seconds worth of thought breaks this down completely as it's one thing to have ""on site"" special effects and no double takes in a slow-paced reality show about an insurance agent and it's quite another to have it in a show with a super-hero dog. Furthermore, viewers are likely going to be bothered by the timeline: it is implied that Bolt was Penny's dog when she was a child, before she became the co-star of the show, then her ""father"" (an actor) was kidnapped, just before turning Bolt into a super-dog. This means that either the actor who plays her father really IS her father (he doesn't seem to be) or Bolt didn't pay much attention to the family life around the house. Or something. It's just too convoluted, it's unnecessary for the script, and it bogs down the movie making replay value on this particular bit pretty low. Then again, this is a movie aimed at kids, so maybe I'm being too nitpicky.When Bolt escapes from his trailer, intent on rescuing Penny from the clutches of villainy, he is astonished to see that his super powers suddenly don't work anymore. As he works his way back to Penny, he takes a female cat hostage (on the advice of three pigeons lifted, pretty clearly, out ofAnimaniacsand collects an overly excitable gerbil who, being a veteran couch-potato, recognizes Bolt as being a super-dog without recognizing that he is, in fact, an actor. When Bolt is eventually forced to confront the fact that he does not, in fact, have super powers, he is (to my delight) no less determined to find Penny - now out of love, rather than duty. Along the way, Bolt learns what it means to be a 'regular dog' while he teaches his companions how to find joy in a life that they thought no longer held anything for them. They realize, as a group, that the quiet life is a best life.I really enjoyed ""Bolt"", despite the initially painful set-up, as the movie finds and hits its stride quickly after that and rolls smoothly on from there. Bolt is a wonderful hero, never annoying or insufferable either because of his super-powers or without them. He doesn't succumb to self-pity and he remembers, always, his friends and what they have done for him. Penny, too, is a wonderful character, balancing her responsibilities carefully and yearning for a 'real life' for her darling dog and, perhaps, for herself. The ending is particularly heartwarming and satisfying and - despite many 'incredible journey' type movies - the anxiety of separation is mild and fairly downplayed. Certainly, this is a superb movie for children, and most adults will enjoy the ride.~ Ana Mardoll",5,"Corny beginning, but hits its stride wonderfully.",1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,3498,"['Bolt', '/', 'B001OMU6UW*Spoilers*', 'Bolt', 'smoothly', 'set-up', 'presented', 'Bolt', 'star', 'action', 'show', 'where', 'super', 'powers', 'protect', 'clever', 'owner', 'Penny', 'not', 'souped-up', 'version', 'Brain', 'fromInspector', 'Gadget', 'vividly', 'amusingly', 'Bolt', ""'super"", 'bark', 'thoroughly', 'decimate', 'onslaught', 'cars', 'Penny', 'darts', 'skillfully', 'traffic', 'course', 'just', 'television', 'show', 'learn', 'early', 'Bolt', 'not-so-blissfully', 'unaware', 'of.Then', 'exposition', 'dialogue', 'unfortunately', 'ham-fisted', 'more', 'problems', 'wit', 'order', 'movie', 'script', 'work', 'Bolt', 'really', 'believe', 'television', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'order', 'explain', 'script', 'writers', 'opted', 'go', 'eccentric', 'director', 'who', 'constructed', 'Bolt', 'entire', 'reality', 'laThe', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Unfortunately', 'about', 'five', 'seconds', 'worth', 'thought', 'breaks', 'down', 'completely', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'site', 'special', 'effects', 'double', 'slow-paced', 'reality', 'show', 'insurance', 'agent', 'quite', 'have', 'show', 'super-hero', 'dog', 'Furthermore', 'viewers', 'are', 'likely', 'going', 'be', 'bothered', 'timeline', 'implied', 'Bolt', 'was', 'Penny', 'dog', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'became', 'co-star', 'show', 'then', 'father', 'actor', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'just', 'turning', 'Bolt', 'super-dog', 'actor', 'who', 'father', 'really', 'father', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'Bolt', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'family', 'life', 'house', 'something', 'just', 'too', 'convoluted', 'unnecessary', 'script', 'bogs', 'down', 'movie', 'making', 'replay', 'value', 'particular', 'bit', 'pretty', 'low', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', 'aimed', 'kids', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'nitpicky.When', 'Bolt', 'escapes', 'trailer', 'intent', 'rescuing', 'Penny', 'clutches', 'villainy', 'astonished', 'see', 'super', 'powers', 'suddenly', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'anymore', 'way', 'back', 'Penny', 'female', 'cat', 'hostage', 'advice', 'three', 'pigeons', 'lifted', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'ofAnimaniacsand', 'collects', 'overly', 'excitable', 'gerbil', 'who', 'being', 'veteran', 'couch-potato', 'Bolt', 'being', 'super-dog', 'recognizing', 'fact', 'actor', 'When', 'Bolt', 'eventually', 'forced', 'confront', 'fact', 'not', 'fact', 'have', 'super', 'powers', 'delight', 'less', 'determined', 'find', 'Penny', 'now', 'love', 'rather', 'duty', 'way', 'Bolt', 'what', 'be', ""'regular"", 'dog', 'companions', 'how', 'find', 'joy', 'life', 'thought', 'no', 'longer', 'held', 'anything', 'realize', 'group', 'quiet', 'life', 'best', 'life.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Bolt', 'initially', 'painful', 'set-up', 'movie', 'stride', 'quickly', 'smoothly', 'Bolt', 'wonderful', 'hero', 'never', 'annoying', 'insufferable', 'super-powers', ""n't"", 'succumb', 'self-pity', 'always', 'friends', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'Penny', 'too', 'wonderful', 'character', 'balancing', 'responsibilities', 'carefully', 'yearning', ""'real"", 'life', 'darling', 'dog', 'perhaps', 'ending', 'particularly', 'heartwarming', 'satisfying', 'many', ""'incredible"", 'journey', 'type', 'movies', 'anxiety', 'separation', 'mild', 'fairly', 'downplayed', 'Certainly', 'superb', 'movie', 'children', 'most', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'ride.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Bolt

1222657,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001OMU6UM,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","I'm going to go out on a HUGE limb here and say that the film that should have won that 2008 Oscar for Best Animated Feature was `Bolt'.  I know, I know; `Wall-E' is wonderful, but for me that particular film falls a bit short with it's unoriginal and wildly clich&eacute;d ending (besides, of Pixar's three year winning streak, `Wall-E' was BY FAR the weakest link).  `Bolt', while not free from its own set of clich&eacute;s, never once disappointed me.  I laughed, I cried, I was concerned, I was intrigued, I was tense, I was jovial; everything I could have ever wanted in a cartoon (NO, never use that word) was found in `Bolt'.The film tells the story of Bolt, a television super-dog who doesn't realize he isn't really a super-dog.  He has been raised to fully believe he has superpowers and that his `person' Penny is truly in danger.  So, when the television studio takes a risk and decides to leave the audience with a cliffhanger (Penny's capture by the evil Dr. Calico), Bolt escapes into the real world in order to rescue Penny himself.Once in the real world, Bolt soon realizes that he is far from the super-dog he thought he was.  What he learns though, is that he is an even bigger super-dog than the television show let-on.This lovely little film definitely wins points for addressing the emptiness of celebrity without every going over the top (""nope, never seen him before in my life"").  It also would certainly make PETA very happy with its stern take on the abandonment of animals (I actually teared up during Mittens' big reveal).  At heart though, this film is all about the power of love and loyalty (dogs are noted for their loyalty).  The film teaches the valuable lesson that, if we believe, we can achieve.  Bolt suffers a huge blow when he realizes his powers are fake, but the real power he possesses is his heart, and that `weapon' is more powerful than any super-bark could be.The film manages to evoke a lot of emotional responses, and it understands how to make everything fit together well.  The film has its intense moments, which could be a tad scary for kids, but the overall feel to the film is a jovial and heartwarming one.  The films opening is particularly well done (it's like a movie inside a movie), but the high opening doesn't give way to any sort of a let-down.The film just keeps getting better and better.The voice work here is also great.  John Travolta has a voice suited for this kind of work.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Miley is rather unrecognizable, but whatever (she's not really in the film too much).  For me, the standouts were Mark Walton and Susie Essman.  They were hysterical, and Essman had the right amount of earnestness to make her character's arc truly touching.Yes, this film has its share of clich&eacute;s (I mean, Rhino is a clich&eacute; in himself, but a really funny one), and the Hollywoodized happy ending was expected (this is a film about Hollywood in a way) but it is also totally welcome here.  This film embraces and embellishes its own faults to make something beautiful out of them.Like I said, this film, for me, was better than `Wall-E'.",5,Consider me `Team Bolt'!,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,3128,"[""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'out', 'HUGE', 'limb', 'here', 'say', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'won', '2008', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'was', 'Bolt', 'know', 'know', 'Wall-E', 'wonderful', 'particular', 'film', 'bit', 'short', 'unoriginal', 'wildly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ending', 'Pixar', 'three', 'year', 'winning', 'streak', 'Wall-E', 'was', 'BY', 'FAR', 'weakest', 'link', 'Bolt', 'not', 'free', 'own', 'set', 'clich', 'eacute', 'never', 'once', 'disappointed', 'laughed', 'cried', 'was', 'concerned', 'was', 'intrigued', 'was', 'tense', 'was', 'jovial', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'wanted', 'cartoon', 'NO', 'never', 'use', 'word', 'was', 'found', ""Bolt'.The"", 'film', 'story', 'Bolt', 'television', 'super-dog', 'who', ""n't"", 'realize', ""n't"", 'really', 'super-dog', 'been', 'raised', 'fully', 'believe', 'superpowers', 'person', 'Penny', 'truly', 'danger', 'So', 'when', 'television', 'studio', 'risk', 'decides', 'leave', 'audience', 'cliffhanger', 'Penny', 'capture', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Calico', 'Bolt', 'real', 'world', 'order', 'rescue', 'Penny', 'himself.Once', 'real', 'world', 'Bolt', 'soon', 'far', 'super-dog', 'thought', 'was', 'What', 'even', 'bigger', 'super-dog', 'television', 'show', 'let-on.This', 'lovely', 'little', 'film', 'definitely', 'points', 'addressing', 'emptiness', 'celebrity', 'going', 'top', 'nope', 'never', 'seen', 'life', 'also', 'would', 'certainly', 'make', 'PETA', 'very', 'happy', 'stern', 'take', 'abandonment', 'animals', 'actually', 'teared', 'up', 'Mittens', 'big', 'reveal', 'heart', 'film', 'power', 'love', 'loyalty', 'dogs', 'are', 'noted', 'loyalty', 'film', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'believe', 'can', 'achieve', 'Bolt', 'huge', 'blow', 'when', 'powers', 'are', 'fake', 'real', 'power', 'heart', 'weapon', 'more', 'powerful', 'super-bark', 'could', 'be.The', 'film', 'manages', 'evoke', 'lot', 'emotional', 'responses', 'how', 'make', 'everything', 'fit', 'together', 'well', 'film', 'intense', 'moments', 'could', 'be', 'tad', 'scary', 'kids', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'jovial', 'heartwarming', 'one', 'films', 'opening', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'movie', 'high', 'opening', ""n't"", 'give', 'way', 'sort', 'let-down.The', 'film', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better.The', 'voice', 'work', 'here', 'also', 'great', 'John', 'Travolta', 'voice', 'suited', 'kind', 'work', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Miley', 'rather', 'unrecognizable', 'not', 'really', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'standouts', 'were', 'Mark', 'Walton', 'Susie', 'Essman', 'were', 'hysterical', 'Essman', 'had', 'right', 'amount', 'earnestness', 'make', 'character', 'arc', 'truly', 'touching.Yes', 'film', 'share', 'clich', 'eacute', 'mean', 'Rhino', 'clich', 'eacute', 'really', 'funny', 'one', 'Hollywoodized', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'expected', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'also', 'totally', 'welcome', 'here', 'film', 'own', 'faults', 'make', 'something', 'beautiful', 'them.Like', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'Wall-E']",Bolt

The movie spends a fair amount of time on a production set, showing props, actors (and scary actors who take their helmets off and are just normal people), various equipment and special effects.

1222661,A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B001OMU6UM,"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony""","[0, 0]","Disney's Bolt is a white American shepherd, birthmarked with lightning and gifted with super powers. Greatest among these is his undying loyalty to protect his person Penny where together, on their weekly show, they help her father (a research scientist) escape the clutches of Dr. Calico and other super villains.In another Disney era, this alone may have added up to Hayley Mills, David Tomlinson, Dean Jones and a more false movie starring real actors. (Anyone remember ""The Cat From Outer Space""?) But first-time Disney directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams (Williams also co-writing the screenplay) use this premise to spool a warmer, more detailed and visually beautiful animated adventure. ""Bolt"" focuses literally coast to coast on a young girl's and pet's love for each other transcending the TV business itself.The fictional TV show creators insulate Bolt (John Travolta, with the right sweet/salty voice mix) from the outside world, making him believe his powers/their special effects protect Penny (an earnest Miley ""Hannah Montana"" Cyrus). But a plot change joins an almost Rube Goldberg turn of events to send Bolt cross-country to New York, where he meets declawed cat Mittens (a New Yawk-streetwise Susan Essman), then later, in Ohio, hero-worshipping Rhino the hamster (exuberant Mark Walton, who won the part after nailing the role in sound tracking).Together they head cross-country to Hollywood and Penny on a journey of self-discovery. With Mittens' first unwilling, then gently loving help, Bolt trades TV psuedo-superpowers (a superbark, ability to melt locks with his eyes) for powers pets have long held over human hearts: begging food, sticking heads out car windows and finally, love and bravery as he rescues Penny once more helped by his new friends.""Bolt""'s visuals join Disney's legendary attention to backgrounds with fluid motions more commonly trademarked by sister studio Pixar. This is most notable in the fast-moving ""Bolt"" TV show action scenes in the film's first 15 minutes. (Casual fans may need to see the ""Walt Disney Animation"" logo, referncing Mickey Mouse debut ""Steamboat Willie,"" to tell the difference.) The bonus features literally illumninate the directors' approach, addressing subtle light and shade changes on New York streets, an Ohio trailer park, a Las Vegas desert and finally, to ""Bolt""'s"" studio for the thrill-filled climax. The voices (featuring everyone from ex-wrestler Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage to TV host James ""You are electric!"" Lipton) are on point, except for Greg Germann's too-smarmy Phil Hartman impression as ""the agent.""Bonus features including an entertaining short featuring Rhino (look for him to get a ToonDisney series soon), a music video featuring Cyrus and Travolta, some intriguing deleted scenes where Bolt could earlier have realized his mortality, and even a spontaneous video where Walton discovers he won ""Rhino's"" voice part. ""Bolt,"" the film, echoes too many Disney and Pixar classics (""Homeward Bound,"" ""Finding Nemo"") to stand among the studio's masterpieces. But it recalls those classics with sly wit and a warm visual style. In a company often known for sequels and cross-marketing, here's hoping this ""Bolt"" isn't just one from the blue.

First off, the intro may seem actiony.... if you're a 5 year old. We all know that this action sequence is part of the tv show, we know that because in the trailer it said that he was a tv dog. The beginning sequence just seemed like it dragged on and on. When he finnaly gets out into the real world, he meets a cat named Mittens and a hampster named Rhino (Who is the only humor in the movie). It just seems like this drags on and on. It was boring in every single way! My parents were watching this with me, and we kept looking at each other thinking ""Um, when is it going to get good?"". Finally, we get a good REAL action sequence where Bolt saves Penny from a fire. This is the only part of the movie that was touching and had me crying. After that, the ending just showed how pathetic the TV studio was (They tried to do a new epi of the Bolt TV show with a new dog and girl. Epic fail btw) And the cat and hampster end up getting adopted by Penny which was sweet even though you can see it coming a mile away.What happened to you Disney? You had great films, and now this. This film was as boring as Night at the Museum, and what's worse, they had to cast freakin Miley Cyrus to play Penny, not only that but they use some of her songs! UGH! Also, they stole the plot, from one of their own movies! They stole the TV Dog going into the real world plot from 101 Dalmations 2: Patch's London Adventure (Great Movie). Honestly, stealing your own plots, making boring movies, creating Hannah Montana?! Walt is probably rolling in his grave.Oh, but it gets better! In the mini movie, Super Rhino, Rhino the Hampster has a dream that he now has super powers and has to save Penny and Bolt. It got a couple snickers out of me, but the end is a WTF moment. After he saves Penny and Bolt, Rhino takes an elevator the leads to a stage where he starts singing ""The Best of Both Worlds"" by freakin Hannah Montana! WTF?! Disney, why the heck are you advertising your lame sitcoms during a mini movie! I just can not get over that!I'm sorry Disney, but only a couple snickers thanks to a hampster, and one touching moment out of 130 minutes is not going to cut it.

1222679,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001OMU6UM,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","You know the formula, classic Walt Disney. Some cute and cuddly lead character, attacked by a black evil character, scare the little kids for a while, there's a big fight, and the cute and cuddly lead character wins. If you love the Disney formula, this film is a total winner. Hate that formula, and well you just won't enjoy this film.Animation has certainly made a ton of progress in the past few years. This movie is no exception. Where the Incredibles (The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)) were more cartoon, primary colors, Bolt is more cartoon-realistic, with primary colors and shading. The feel of the two films is pretty similar.So the scary part for little kids, there's a ton of subwoofer activity (very loud booms) in the first few minutes. Most of it is a big surprise. In fact my 13 year old son dropped his root beer bottle during one very surprising scene a bit later on. There's a lot of shooting, killing, chasing, implausible action during the first 30 minutes. Ah, just warning sensitive parents.Overall, the story is cute. The dog, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta), thinks he is a superhero dog with superhero powers. Bolt stays on set all the time. Somehow the production people of this television program have decided a dog knows about his setting and will fall out of character if he finds out he doesn't really have super powers (very very odd premise, if you think too hard about it). Two cats taunt Bolt, and make him believe Penny is in trouble. Bolt escapes the set, accidently gets packed in a box with styrofoam peanuts, and gets shipped to New York. There the road movie starts up when Bolt meets an alley cat. The movie is mostly a road movie, how does Bolt get back to LA.There's some good funny moments - the three different sets of three pigeons are hilarious. The Quentin Tarratino parody at the beginning is just too funny (although it's probably very close to the bone in reality). Bolt is very likeable, Travolta does a great job. The hamster is pretty darn funny. Miley - ah, not so great (and it's not just because I'm not a huge Miley fan - overexposure), her voice just wasn't that wonderful.Closing credit song - Travolta FANS - John and Miley sing a duet for the closing credits. I'll have to admit, he's gotten some singing lessons since his last singing in a movie (Love Song For Bobby Long - super great movie,A Love Song for Bobby Long, not for kids at all). John was a blues singer in that film, in Bolt he's a straight ballad singer with a pretty decent voice.The DVD is pretty sparse, with one great exception. There is an awesome funny bonus feature about Rhino the hamster. Oh it's so worth watching. The rest is trailers. Again Disney does it's ridiculous Fast Start nonsense at first insertion of the disc (when will they ever realize the stupidity of that ""feature."")Overall - darn good movie. Not a great one (I liked Incredibles more). But, it's really good entertainment for a Saturday afternoon.

1222681,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B001OMU6UM,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[64, 74]","""Bolt"" really blew me away; this is the first time that I have seen a CGI film that shows a level of mastery that allows the visual artistry of the film to be the driver rather than the capabilities of the computer. The characters have the typical CGI look--extremely well rendered, with the 3D type look you'd expect. However, the backgrounds have the look of a traditional painting. Art Director Paul Felix should be commended for this mixing of styles which works out extremely well. The overall lighting, colors, and style of this film are its hallmark in my opinion. The story is really not anything that will blow you away; in fact, it is somewhat predictable; however, with the characterizations, action sequences, visual quality, and the vocal talents behind the characters, ""Bolt"" becomes a must-see.In a nutshell: Bolt (John Travolta) is a super-hero canine...at least in his own mind and to TV viewers everywhere. In order to protect his performance and keep it ""real,"" TV execs have sheltered Bolt and he believes that what he accomplishes on his show is all done on his own, not through special effects. Bolt is deeply devoted to his human costar, Penny, a little girl (Miley Cyrus), who is also deeply devoted to him as well. Mistakenly thinking that Penny is in danger at the hands of the TV villains, Bolt escapes his trailer and finds himself in the real world, where his super powers are not so super. He accidentally gets shipped to NYC, and thinks that the pink styrofoam peanuts clinging to his fur are the cause of his loss of power. With the help of a hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton) and a street-tough kitten, Mittens (Susie Essman, who is FANTASTIC!), Bolt must find his way back to Hollywood and his beloved Penny. It is a tale of growth, maturity, and love; again, nothing really earth-shattering, but in this recycled tale that we have seen in other movies, it is done so well that you forgive the studio for its predictability.BONUS MATERIAL:""Super Rhino"" (4:27)--Rhino the hamster gets the spotlight in this animated short focusing on him. Cute!Deleted Scenes: 2 deleted scenes (""Dog Fight in Vegas"" and ""River Sequence"") with introductions by directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard. They are both shown in storyboard form and neither is really missed from the final picture. They were not used mainly because they wanted to heighten the emotional level of Bolt finding out about his lack of powers.""In Session with John Travolta & Miley Cyrus"" (:59)--This one is like a blip on the radar...very short! Interviews with both stars as they get ready to sing the duet from the movie ""I Thought I Lost You."" They are truly a mutual admiration society, with Travolta comparing Cyrus to the appeal of Olivia Newton John in ""Grease.""""I Thought I Lost You"" Music Video--Interspersed with footage of Travolta & Cyrus and clips from the film.Bolt's Be-Awesome Mission--High def video game is somewhat more challenging and fun than the typical Disney video game extra. Begin at level 1, The Burning Warehouse and see how far you can progress! Takes a little bit of mastering of the controls on the remote.""A New Breed of Directors: A Filmmakers' Journey"" (4:34)-- The two directors discuss what it was like to make ""Bolt,"" and how John Lasseter was a great mentor and guide in the process. Fun to see the gigantic plastic hamster ball that the animators played in to diffuse tensions around the office. Obviously great camaraderie was apparent with the team, as they also stopped shaving in unison during the last 9-10 weeks of work on the film.""Act, Speak! The Voices of Bolt"" (9:47)--Always interesting to see how each actor has to record their lines independently, making the process of playing off the other characters next to impossible. Really takes talent to make it work. Travolta began in voicework (commercials), so this was a return to his roots. He comments that ""You can only contribute your voice...the most exciting this was seeing the marriage with the animation."" Mark Walton, a Disney animation team member, did the scratch voice of Rhino, and was so perfect that he was cast in the final movie. The actual video of him finding this news out is touching to watch as you see his unbridled enthusiasm. Susie Essman (""Curb Your Enthusiasm""), the voice of Mittens, was excited to show her method acting skills, but was told by the Disney team to be herself. They wanted a tough kitten with a New York accent. As Susie says, ""It's just me."" Disappointingly enough, she never met Travolta during her recording sessions, even though practically every scene in the movie involves her character interacting with Travolta's.Bolt Art Galleries: Character Design, Color Script, Storyboard Art, and Visual Development. Sure is fantastic to see this great pieces of art filling up a widescreen high-def TV. The quality is really amazing, and sure beats the old days of DVD when art gallery images were in low-res and fairly tiny.""Creating the World of Bolt"" (6:45): The amazing work of art director Paul Felix and lighting director Adolph Lusinsky is detailed here. They actually visited the many locations across the country to make sure that they were able to capture the light of each unique scenic setting. Felix wanted the painterly looks of traditionally animated Disney films, and he definitely succeeds. Interesting to watch this featurette.Also included:Digital Copy disc and a DVD of the feature with all the bonus features except the art gallery and video game.SPECS:Video: 1080p High Def/1.78:1. Disney is to be commended for having high-def extras as well. Whereas most studios go to the usual crappy video quality, Disney consistently upgrades even the extras. Especially enjoyable for the video game.Audio: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. I actually had to turn the volume down a bit, as this movie really gives the speakers a work-out. Sound comes out of all your speakers, and with a number of action sequences, the subwoofer really rumbles! Extremely impressive!

The sound and picture are both excellent and the 3D version is very effective. The 3D version is presently only available through Sony for purchasers of a Sony 3D TV. That is similar to the Panasonic program which offers Avatar in 3D to purchasers of a Panasonic 3D TV. I suspect they will both be available for general purchase within a year or so.The story is of a girl and her dog that just happens to hit the big time in Hollywood as stars of an adventure series, but are then separated by an unfortunate set of circumstances. The story follows the adventures of the dog, Bolt, who is devoted to his beloved girl and determined to find her again.Bolt's life is complicated by one awkward misconception; he has come to believe that the special effects wonders he performs on stage are all real; he believes he can really do all of those miraculous things he appears to do courtesy of the special effects and stage props.During his journey home he encounters all sorts of adventures which teach him the reality of his personal strengths and weaknesses and the value of friendship.The movie is remarkable in its clear cut presentation of high moral and ethical principles; I definitely recommend it as a first-rate movie for all of the family!",5,Charming and Delightful for the Entire Family,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,1598,"[""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'Bolt', 'twice', 'once', '2D', 'now', '3D', 'times', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'heartwarming', 'adventure', 'triumph', 'good', 'evil', 'great', 'importance', 'friends', 'faithful', 'love.The', 'movie', 'really', 'fun', 'watch', 'picks', 'up', 'viewers', 'along', 'fast', 'paced', 'adventure', 'entire', 'United', 'States', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'excellent', '3D', 'version', 'very', 'effective', '3D', 'version', 'presently', 'only', 'available', 'Sony', 'purchasers', 'Sony', '3D', 'TV', 'similar', 'Panasonic', 'program', 'Avatar', '3D', 'purchasers', 'Panasonic', '3D', 'TV', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'general', 'purchase', 'year', 'so.The', 'story', 'girl', 'dog', 'just', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'adventure', 'series', 'are', 'then', 'separated', 'unfortunate', 'set', 'circumstances', 'story', 'adventures', 'dog', 'Bolt', 'who', 'devoted', 'beloved', 'girl', 'determined', 'find', 'again.Bolt', 'life', 'complicated', 'one', 'awkward', 'misconception', 'come', 'believe', 'special', 'effects', 'wonders', 'stage', 'are', 'real', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'miraculous', 'things', 'do', 'courtesy', 'special', 'effects', 'stage', 'props.During', 'journey', 'home', 'sorts', 'adventures', 'teach', 'reality', 'personal', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'value', 'friendship.The', 'movie', 'remarkable', 'clear', 'cut', 'presentation', 'high', 'moral', 'ethical', 'principles', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'first-rate', 'movie', 'family']",Bolt

We laughed many times, and the animation was sweet and adorable. The story was also very touching. As usual, Disney manages to infuse the story with several useful ""messages"", and does so without being preachy. One of course, is that Bolt is loved and missed despite not actually being a superhero, and his own acceptance, that he has a purpose, without being one. Another was when the cat was telling her story, of how her owners, let her fend for herself without claws-an obvious plea to not abandon your cat, and especially not, if he/she has no claws to defend itself.

She coaches him about fetching a stick, greeting and playing with other dogs, and how to stick his head out a car window.  All this as Bolt and cohorts race across the country to reach his beloved owner, Penny. Here's the setup: Bolt is a dog portraying a super canine on a television show who has been altered to protect his owner. Only Bolt thinks it's all real and that he really does have super strength, laser beam eyes, and a superbark. It's kind of clever the way the movie audience learns the truth  through a conversation with the show's director and a woman from the network. In this scene, the director has a fit when a boom mike appears in a scene, not because it ruined the scene, but because Bolt could have seen it. Anyway, the network  wants the show to be less predictable. So to comply, the show stages a cliffhanger whereby the episode ends with Penny being kidnapped by Bolt's nemesis, the evil Dr. Calico (voiced by Malcolm McDowell in a way too-short performance). Bolt, thinking it's real and his owner has been captured by his enemy, escapes from his trailer and tries to find Penny, but accidentally gets shipped to New York and thus has to embark on a cross-country journey to get back to Penny. A recurring gag are the hapless pigeons Bolt and company encounter and talk to at various points in their journey. They share information and actually get the whole thing rolling by pointing Bolt to Mittens, who was bullying some of the pigeons in New York. So there's lessons to be learned about friendship and loyalty, reality vs. non-reality, as well as some exciting action sequences (mostly in the fantasy world of the TV show, but the escape from the animal shelter is exciting too). Miley Cyress and John Travolta are fine as the voices of  Penny and Bolt, respectively, but for me, Susie Essman as the voice of Mittens steals every scene she's in. There's some real voice acting here. The other breakout character is a geeky hamster named Rhino, voiced by geeky real life storyboard artist Mark Walton (who also did voicework in Turbo and Chicken Little) who accompanies Bolt and Mittens on their adventure. How is it that Mittens came to understand that what's on TV isn't real (a feat some humans I know haven't mastered)? I like that unlike many other animated projects, this feels like it has a very small scope, but at the same time, they get the big action setpieces in as part of the Bolt TV series.",5,"Bolt seems like a small movie, but still has fantastic visuals and action setpieces",1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,2584,"['favorite', 'part', 'Bolt', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'street-wise', 'cat', 'teaches', 'highly-sheltered', 'nave', 'dog', 'how', 'act', 'canine', 'fetching', 'stick', 'greeting', 'playing', 'other', 'dogs', 'how', 'stick', 'head', 'car', 'window', 'Bolt', 'cohorts', 'race', 'country', 'reach', 'beloved', 'owner', 'Penny', 'Here', 'setup', 'Bolt', 'dog', 'portraying', 'super', 'canine', 'television', 'show', 'who', 'been', 'altered', 'protect', 'owner', 'Only', 'Bolt', 'real', 'really', 'have', 'super', 'strength', 'laser', 'beam', 'eyes', 'superbark', 'kind', 'clever', 'way', 'movie', 'audience', 'truth', 'conversation', 'show', 'director', 'woman', 'network', 'scene', 'director', 'fit', 'when', 'boom', 'mike', 'scene', 'not', 'ruined', 'scene', 'Bolt', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'Anyway', 'network', 'show', 'be', 'less', 'predictable', 'So', 'comply', 'show', 'cliffhanger', 'whereby', 'episode', 'Penny', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'Bolt', 'nemesis', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Calico', 'voiced', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'way', 'too-short', 'performance', 'Bolt', 'thinking', 'real', 'owner', 'been', 'captured', 'enemy', 'trailer', 'tries', 'find', 'Penny', 'accidentally', 'shipped', 'New', 'York', 'thus', 'embark', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'get', 'back', 'Penny', 'A', 'recurring', 'gag', 'are', 'hapless', 'pigeons', 'Bolt', 'company', 'encounter', 'talk', 'various', 'points', 'journey', 'share', 'information', 'actually', 'get', 'whole', 'thing', 'rolling', 'pointing', 'Bolt', 'Mittens', 'who', 'was', 'bullying', 'pigeons', 'New', 'York', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'reality', 'vs.', 'non-reality', 'as', 'well', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'mostly', 'fantasy', 'world', 'TV', 'show', 'escape', 'animal', 'shelter', 'exciting', 'too', 'Miley', 'Cyress', 'John', 'Travolta', 'are', 'fine', 'voices', 'Penny', 'Bolt', 'respectively', 'Susie', 'Essman', 'voice', 'Mittens', 'steals', 'scene', 'real', 'voice', 'acting', 'here', 'other', 'breakout', 'character', 'geeky', 'hamster', 'named', 'Rhino', 'voiced', 'geeky', 'real', 'life', 'storyboard', 'artist', 'Mark', 'Walton', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'voicework', 'Turbo', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'who', 'Bolt', 'Mittens', 'adventure', 'How', 'came', 'understand', 'what', 'TV', ""n't"", 'real', 'feat', 'humans', 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'mastered', 'like', 'many', 'other', 'animated', 'projects', 'feels', 'very', 'small', 'scope', 'same', 'time', 'get', 'big', 'action', 'setpieces', 'part', 'Bolt', 'TV', 'series']",Bolt

Bolt is a star in show where he has super powers. Everything is well only that Bolt does not know he is a TV show, he thinks everything is real.

1222700,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B001OMU6UM,Erica Anderson,"[1, 8]","BOLT is the story of a canine tv star of the same name (voiced by John Travolta) who has spent all of his life on the hollywood set where the show he works on with his co-star Penny (Miley Cyrus). Because he has spent all of his life on the set, he doesn't realize that his reality is really fiction. When Bolt suddenly finds himself in the ""real"" world, chaos ensues and Bolt learns the hard way that his reality isn't what it appears to be.Normally I enjoy Disney's animated films likeWall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)but that is due to the strong writing, animation, music, and performances that comes with working with Pixar. Without Pixar, Disney's animated films like BOLT is bland. I think it is obvious that BOLT is aimed more towards the younger audiences than an adult audience. Children will definitely enjoy the story of Bolt trying to survive New York City while he is on the search for Penny. For me personally there wasn't anything about this film that made it likeable for me. The film lacked the strong writing and superb animation of WALL-E and even KUNG FU PANDA.Disc two features some behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, and the cast in action for the film. At least Disney didn't skimp out on bonus features.

1222701,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B001OMU6UM,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[1, 7]","From the ""We're Disney, we don't need Pixar everytime we do animation!"", comes a film that disproves that theory in the CGI filled 00's. Sure, at times it's looks like a Pixar film circa ""A Bug Life"", but that was over ten years ago. Sure, my 10 year old was entertained, but when a person that age isn't ""blown away"" with the first viewing you know you got a middle-of-the-road CGI flix. Bolt (an unrecognizable John Travolta) is a dog, similar to Lassie thru James Bond, that has his own TV show where he saves his young female owner (voiced by Miley Cyrus, who sounds like she needs to lay off the two-packs-a-day of Virginia Slims) from evil trying to destroy them. But Bolt doesn't know that he's just an actor and thru a typical plot point of getting sent hundreds of miles away from the one he loves to try to find a way back to her while learning the hard truths of who he really is along the way. Also lending a voice was surprisingly Susie Essman of Curb Your Enthusiasm who I kept expecting to say ""What's the f&*%$*' a matter with you Dog?"". Another thing I noticed is alot of gags seem to be borrowed from alot of other films and TV shows, most noticeably the New York pigeons that looked straight out of '90's Warner Bros Goodfeathers cartoon, which seemed more rip-off than homage. And of course you have the goof character Rhino The Hamster, rolling ball and all that helps with the lack of original lines & sight-gags along the way. Overall, this will pass the time with the younger generation but I doubt they'll be screaming for multiple viewings over WALL+E or even Kung Fu Panda. The one-disc version has the typical Disney ""look, we still have other retread stuff"" promos and a short film starring Rhino that you'll see coming a mile away, and way too short to boot (even for a short!). A decent rental, but like what the pigeons say, ""I've seen this dog somewhere before, but where?"" you'll be thinking the exact same thing.(RedSabbath Rating:7.0/10)",3,"Doggonit, I Feel Like I've Seen This Hound Of A Flix Before...",1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,1973,"[""'re"", 'Disney', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Pixar', 'everytime', 'do', 'animation', 'film', 'theory', 'CGI', 'filled', '00', 'Sure', 'times', 'Pixar', 'film', 'circa', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Sure', '10', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'entertained', 'when', 'person', 'age', ""n't"", 'blown', 'away', 'first', 'viewing', 'know', 'got', 'middle-of-the-road', 'CGI', 'flix', 'Bolt', 'unrecognizable', 'John', 'Travolta', 'dog', 'similar', 'Lassie', 'thru', 'James', 'Bond', 'own', 'TV', 'show', 'where', 'young', 'female', 'owner', 'voiced', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'who', 'lay', 'off', 'two-packs-a-day', 'Virginia', 'Slims', 'evil', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Bolt', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'actor', 'thru', 'typical', 'plot', 'point', 'getting', 'sent', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'away', 'one', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'learning', 'hard', 'truths', 'who', 'really', 'way', 'Also', 'lending', 'voice', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'Susie', 'Essman', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'who', 'kept', 'expecting', 'say', 'What', 'f', '*', '%', '*', 'matter', 'Dog', 'thing', 'noticed', 'alot', 'gags', 'seem', 'be', 'borrowed', 'alot', 'other', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', 'most', 'noticeably', 'New', 'York', 'pigeons', 'looked', 'straight', ""'90"", 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Goodfeathers', 'cartoon', 'seemed', 'more', 'rip-off', 'homage', 'course', 'have', 'goof', 'character', 'Rhino', 'Hamster', 'rolling', 'ball', 'lack', 'original', 'lines', 'sight-gags', 'way', 'Overall', 'will', 'pass', 'time', 'younger', 'generation', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'screaming', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'WALL+E', 'even', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'one-disc', 'version', 'typical', 'Disney', 'look', 'still', 'have', 'other', 'retread', 'stuff', 'promos', 'short', 'film', 'starring', 'Rhino', ""'ll"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'boot', 'even', 'short', 'decent', 'rental', 'what', 'pigeons', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dog', 'somewhere', 'before', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'RedSabbath', 'Rating:7.0/10']",Bolt

Bolt is a movie that was convinced by the U.S box office receipts that it was an underachiever when in reality it is one of the finest of Disney's recent animated features. Much speculation has surrounded the reasons for the grosses, two being the marketing angles and its competition on the same premiere weekend.It was nominated for an Academy Award, it's a smash in the United Kingdom and is sure to hit big on DVD, especially in this nicely-packaged edition. If you're fortunate enough to have a Blu-Ray player, the magnificent artistry described in the bonus features will be especially apparent. There is a fine series of mini-documentaries about the making of the film and a very funny new short, SUPER RHINO, starring the breakout character, though the pop culture reference at the film's conclusion will become as dated as a MONKEES throwback. I suppose that's okay because it's a short and not the film itself.And the film itself is very entertaining. While there is always comment about whether the voice work of John Travolta and Miley Cyrus was any better than that of an actor who specializes in voice work, they did not phone in their performances. Travolta enthusiastically treated this role as if it was his big break, when he could have done otherwise. And it's nice to hear the duo sing together.The supporting characters, and their voices, steal the movie, which is nothing new in Disney films, including those from Walt's day. In addition to Disney artist-turned-voice artists Mark Walton (you have to love the guy when you see his reaction on the bonus material after getting the role) as Rhino the Hamster, Susie Essman is marvelous as Mittens (which was our cat's name too!). Even Diedrich Bader, whose voice work deserves more acclaim, makes the most of a very small role in the early portion of the film.There are three versions of BOLT on DVD/Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray version offers the movie in dazzling, wondrous glory on a Blu-Ray disc along with the extras, plus a standard DVD of the film plus a digital disc for free downloading.

1222713,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001OMU6UM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","It's almost unfair for BOLT that it has to follow all these other animated kid classics from Pixar and Disney. Otherwise, I think this film garners even more props. As it is, the word on BOLT is strong and very positive. I personally think it ranks up there with the likes of A BUG'S LIFE, MONSTERS, INC., FINDING NEMO, THE INCREDIBLES, WALL-E and the TOY STORY flicks. BOLT is ideally suited for children, with its flawless visuals, relatable humor, and its sweet message. Yet it's sophisticated enough that the grown-ups will walk away also having had a great time.The cute opening scene shows us how Penny comes to choose the tail-waggly, slobbery puppy Bolt at the Animal Rescue shelter. Cut to five years later, and Bolt has become a huge television star. His show features him as a super-powered canine caught up in secret agent shenanigans. It's a popular show, but the network wants to amp it up even more. Accordingly, the latest television escapade climaxes with Penny being kidnapped. This gets us to the meat of the plot.Bolt makes his residence on the Hollywood movie lot; he has in fact never been out in the real world. And here's the thing. Bolt believes that all this secret agent stuff is real, believes that he has super powers and that Penny has been really kidnapped. Frantic to rescue his person, Bolt breaks out of his studio trailer and so plonks himself straight into real life.From this point on, the movie follows a tried and true storyline, that of the devoted pet finding its way back home, this particular trek adhering to a New York to L.A. itinerary. The existential twist here, of course, is that Bolt is so very convinced that he has these extraordinary attributes; he thinks that he really is super-strong and has laser vision and a super-bark - and it takes most of the film to resolve this identity crisis. There's a lot of fun for the audience as the film at first lets Bolt down easy. Each time he tries to apply a super-power and it fails him, circumstances surface which offer him a credible explanation (the uber-explanation being the sinister presence of styrofoam packing peanuts, which Bolt comes to regard as his kryptonite). The story then also becomes about Bolt gradually relaxing and learning what it's like to be a real dog, so wrapped up was he before in his fake reality. Voiced terrifically by John Travolta (and I didn't even know it was Travolta 'til the end credits rolled around), Bolt is an instantly endearing lead. There's a streak of sentimentality which runs thru the film, but what really lends texture are Bolt's key supporting characters and those side characters, and specifically Bolt's initially adversarial relationship with Mittens, the street-savvy alley cat and Bolt's polar opposite in character traits. Bolt is all optimism and sort of brandishes this sense of entitlement, while Mittens is the cynical, world-weary vagabond surviving on her wits. When we first meet Mittens, she's shaking down pigeons for food scraps. I liked her right away. I guess it's only karma that Bolt and Mittens eventually end up muy sympatico.Miley Cyrus is good (but underused) as Penny, but the awesome surprises are Susie Essman as Mittens and Mark Walton as Rhino, the enthusiastic chubby hamster sidekick rolling around in a bubble - and both are wicked scene stealers. Mittens is wonderfully snide, while Rhino is, well, the hamster's insane, almost disturbingly so (and yet I couldn't stop laughing at his lines and antics). I couldn't help snickering at one scene, in which Bolt and Rhino, having infiltrated an animal shelter to rescue Mittens, are peeking at a security guard - and Rhino offers to snap the guard's neck. Hah! And if you're looking for more hamstery fun, included in the single DVD is the 4-minute animated short ""Super Rhino"" which has Rhino gaining super powers. Also fun are that pair of ""evil"" cats and, omigosh, those New York pigeons (these are the side characters I mentioned).It's a given that Bolt will reunite with Penny, Disney wasn't gonna mess with that formula. But, to echo that one maxim, the fun is in the journey. The meat of the story is during the road trip, rife as it is with surprises, laugh out loud humor, and some sweet, heartwarming moments. And, because BOLT also caters to adult sensibilities, sly references are dropped regarding Hollywood and its shady citizens (the most absolutely annoying of whom is Penny's agent).One highlight (of many) is the exhilarating, exquisitely choreographed first eleven minutes which owe something to THE MATRIX and demonstrate Bolt's impressive ""super powers"" (including an impeccably delivered karate punch *snicker*). The time lapse stuff is very cool, and I even liked that one small touch of an explosion causing a distant soda papercup to slowly keel over. I saw the ending coming a mile away, but by that time the movie had already worked its magic on me, so I didn't even mind the clich&eacute;d feel of it. BOLT follows on the heels of exceptional animated children's films and, like those other films, it is slick yet full of heart, is sophisticated yet retains a sense of wonder, is amiably goofy but also witty. BOLT sparks the imagination, but also reduces you to one of those folks who sickeningly go ""Gaga googoo"" at precious babies or ""Aww! Who's a good boy?"" at cute puppies. And is that what happened to me during this film, you ask? Ruefully, I say, ""Yes, dammit.""",5,"""Are you mad?!

I'm glad we did because Bolt is clearly among the second tier of animated films from 2008 withMadagascar - Escape 2 Africa,IgorandSpace Chimps.With a nod towardUnderdog, Bolt is a dog portraying a superhero learns he doesn't have super powers but finds within himself the strength to still be a hero. John Travolta provides Bolt's voice and would win the honor of the worst miscasting if it were not for Miley Cyrus as Penny, Bolt's beloved owner and co-star of his superhero TV show.Neither Travolta nor Cyrus improve this film. They provide names for the marketing department but neither of them breathes life into their animated character. Instead, it is Mark Walton who steaks every scene voicing Rhino, the ball-enclosed hamster who is Bolt's #1 fan.Despite the poor casting and the tired story, the film quality is excellent. The colors are vibrant and the animation is of a much higher quality than what appeared on Space Chimps. There's even one must-see bonus feature - Super Rhino - that (smartly) features the movie's funniest character.In summary, Bolt provides mediocre family entertainment.

I have a family of boys, so no one watched this movie because of Miley Cyrus.

All of us were laughing, or remarking on something cool happening throughout the movie. We were each glued to the film without bordom. My wife and I find the hamster, Rhino, to be our favorite. He is voiced by one of the animators with Disney, and he is cast so well. I know that they use the big Hollywood names to bring people in to watch these films, but to me, having a great character voice is better than having the image of this or that actor when you hear the voice. We were able to not worry about who was saying the lines, and focus on the movie more. This is such a fun movie, with great action, and it does a wonderful job with introducing it's characters and it's storyline very well.

1222735,A9TG2NFA614S9,B001OMU6UM,John F. Rooney,"[0, 0]","""Bolt,"" brilliantly animated and spectacular in Blu-Ray, has an intriguing premise. Bolt is the wonder TV dog that performs outstanding physical and mental feats in order to protect his ""person,"" his owner, young Penny. The hook for the film is a long section of action footage in which Bolt and Penny are doing super-hero work against the evil Dr. Calico. Bolt is isolated from the real world, locked in his studio trailer, and doesn't realize he's acting, the stunts are faked, and he's just an ordinary dog who deeply loves his mistress and will do anything for her.Bolt gets inadvertently shipped to New York from Hollywood. In New York Bolt encounters an extortionist cat named Mittens whom he ties up and takes with him on his cross-country trip. He befriends a hamster named Rhino, but what is the rodent doing in a plastic sphere?The movie has its slow parts particularly Bolt's gradual realization of his ordinariness. It's a journey to self-awareness. A thunderbolt had been painted on his flank, and he discovers that it's just paint.Most animated films seem to have a didactic quality, preaching lessons of inspiration to children, building up their egos, making them more open to loving others and themselves. On his way back across country, what Bolt learns from his friend Mittens: love conquers all, and despite his lack of super powers, he still has to fight to get back to his Penny and never give up his sense of self-worth just because he isn't a super dog. Better to be a real dog than a fake TV dog.John Travolta's voice is perfect for the part of Bolt--very believable, sincere, and earnest. Penny's chunky mother and the greedy agent add to the story line. A lot of background stuff about moviemaking is well-done.It's a great movie for kids. There's no inappropriate adult humor, and dogs nosing around each other shouldn't be offensive.",5,A Great Movie for Kids,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,1862,"['Bolt', 'brilliantly', 'animated', 'spectacular', 'Blu-Ray', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'Bolt', 'wonder', 'TV', 'dog', 'outstanding', 'physical', 'mental', 'feats', 'order', 'protect', 'person', 'owner', 'young', 'Penny', 'hook', 'film', 'long', 'section', 'action', 'footage', 'Bolt', 'Penny', 'are', 'doing', 'super-hero', 'work', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Calico', 'Bolt', 'isolated', 'real', 'world', 'locked', 'studio', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'realize', 'acting', 'stunts', 'are', 'faked', 'just', 'ordinary', 'dog', 'who', 'mistress', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'her.Bolt', 'inadvertently', 'shipped', 'New', 'York', 'Hollywood', 'New', 'York', 'Bolt', 'extortionist', 'cat', 'named', 'Mittens', 'whom', 'up', 'cross-country', 'trip', 'hamster', 'named', 'Rhino', 'what', 'rodent', 'doing', 'plastic', 'sphere', 'movie', 'slow', 'parts', 'particularly', 'Bolt', 'gradual', 'realization', 'ordinariness', 'journey', 'self-awareness', 'thunderbolt', 'had', 'been', 'painted', 'flank', 'just', 'paint.Most', 'animated', 'films', 'seem', 'have', 'didactic', 'quality', 'preaching', 'lessons', 'inspiration', 'children', 'building', 'up', 'egos', 'making', 'more', 'open', 'loving', 'others', 'way', 'back', 'country', 'what', 'Bolt', 'friend', 'love', 'conquers', 'lack', 'super', 'powers', 'still', 'fight', 'get', 'back', 'Penny', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'sense', 'self-worth', 'just', ""n't"", 'super', 'dog', 'Better', 'be', 'real', 'dog', 'fake', 'TV', 'dog.John', 'Travolta', 'voice', 'perfect', 'part', 'Bolt', 'very', 'believable', 'sincere', 'earnest', 'Penny', 'chunky', 'mother', 'greedy', 'agent', 'add', 'story', 'line', 'lot', 'background', 'stuff', 'moviemaking', 'well-done.It', 'great', 'movie', 'kids', 'inappropriate', 'adult', 'humor', 'dogs', 'nosing', 'other', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'offensive']",Bolt

And the visuals are virtuoso.The story has lots of familiar touches. Its road trip plot channelsThe Incredible Journey. Pooch Bolt sincerely thinks he has true superhero powers, much like Buzz Lightyear fromToy Story. The truth is that he is on a television series, and has been living a lie most of his life (The Truman Show, anyone?) His human, a preteen girl named Penny, is a child actress, although she truly loves Bolt and longs to give him a normal doggie life.Although the plot could have been stronger, the visual effects and look of the film are amazing. I kept being distracted by the perfection on the screen. My poor daughter, who went with me to see the movie when it was released in theaters, had to endure me continually tapping her arm, saying ""Did you see that?! The smoke looks REAL!"" or ""The rust on the train looks PERFECT!""A number of scenes use techniques I learned about watching a Pixar documentary on theWall-EDVD. It's about the imperfect lens, or how cameras have inherent limitations. Animation of course doesn't use cameras in the traditional way. Yet in Bolt you see example after example of the filmmakers enhancing the reality of the movie by building in imperfections that don't have to be there. For instance, in one shot Bolt looks up at the sunny sky. The screen shows the squared-off circles you'd see if you pointed a camera's lens into the sun. The film also uses variable depth of field, much like a cameraman does when shooting a live-action movie. It's as if a camera is adjusting its lens as the scene progresses.Bolt is voiced by John Travolta, and Penny by Miley ""Hannah Montana"" Cyrus. Both these likable actors delivered true-life, believable characters.

1222742,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001OMU6UM,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[1, 3]","BOLT, the latest Disney animated offering, is very cute and very fun.  A story about a little girl and her beloved dog, BOLT is a terrific film for the entire family.  My three year old daughter fell in love with the characters; she now wants a little white dog, named BOLT.  My husband and I both enjoyed the film; there are many places were we laughed out loud.In BOLT, Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) and BOLT (voiced by John Travolta) are on their own, saving the world and each other from countless disasters.  Penny's father has been kidnapped by the arch-villian Dr. Calico (voiced by Malcolm McDowell).  But before he disappeared, Penny's father altered BOLT, and turned him into a canine superhero with laser vision, super speed, and the ultimate bark.  But what BOLT doesn't know is that his whole life is a TV series, and that truth has been carefully hidden from him.  He truly believes he has superpowers.  One day, however, after an episode where Dr. Calico captures Penny, BOLT accidentally gets loose in the real world.  He is shocked when his superpowers suddenly fail him, but becomes convinced that pink Styrofoam packing peanuts have the power to weaken him.  Eventually, however, he realizes the truth, and with the help of an alley cat named Mittens and a crazy hamster named Rhino, he discovers who he truly is, as he makes his way back home to Penny.  In the end, BOLT becomes a true hero, and saves the life of the one he loves the most.As I stated above, BOLT is a very entertaining film, perfect for the entire family.  It is funny, adorable, and well cast.  Miley Cyrus is wonderful as Penny.  John Travolta is always a plus.  The rest of the cast is equally good, all working well together.  The animation is gorgeous, extremely realistic, and quite amazing.  Kids like it, and adults like it.So why not five stars?  You would think that a Disney movie about a cute little girl and her adorable pup would be a slam dunk five stars.  Well, it is close, but it just isn't quite ""there.""  I wanted to see/hear more of Miley Cyrus, who does an outstanding job as Penny.  John Travolta, whom I love and who has created many memorable characters, needed MORE character as BOLT.  His voice was pleasant, and there was nothing wrong with his performance; it just didn't grab me the way his characters normally do.  Additionally, I think the writers let the audience down.  There is not a lot of ""pop"" in this script; perhaps it is just a bit bland.  The writers also lost sight of the target audience.  While BOLT is charming in most ways, too much of the comedy goes over kids' heads.  Adults may laugh out loud, but the kids are left puzzled.  While this happens in many kid films, it is usually more subtle and happens less frequently than it did here. The script simply tries to be too many things to too many people.Don't get me wrong, I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOLT, especially for an evening of family entertainment.  This film is very appealing and quite charming.

I think Bolt is destined to be a classic. It's a really well-told story with great characters. True to Disney form, they've created a movie that engages all ages.  My kids particularly enjoyed Rhino.  He's fearless and devoted - in fact he's more like a dog than Bolt is.Bolt is a dog whose entire life has been lived on stage. His self-concept as a super-dog prevents him from enjoying being a dog. The process of learning to be a canine is well-portrayed. From learning to stick his head out the window of a moving vehicle to chasing a stick, Bolt has missed out on the little things that make life fun for a dog.The blu-ray version is excellent. The bonus features were fun for the kids, even if short-lived.  I like having the three-pack which includes the DVD version and a digital copy. The DVD has been left at a Grandparent's house for future viewing and the Digital version has been added to my laptop for travel entertainment.I highly recommend buying DVD's and Blu-ray like Bolt using the pre-order system. Not only is it fun to get the product on it's release date, it can be a nice surprise when you order well in advance and forget it's coming.

The quality of these new toons is quickly surpassing almost all of the live action studio stuff being made, to the point where I'd rather watch one of these for sheer entertainment.The voices are good, the dialogue quite intelligent and rarely sappy, and overall this feels as much made for adults as kids. The phony agent/producer guy is a nice touch as well; no harm in letting kids know what kinds of weasels await in the ""grown-up"" world. Visually, Bolt is stunning; on blu-ray it's a trip. The myriad possibilites afforded by animation are well explored, especially wild ""camera"" angles that make watching this more mind-boggling than all but the best sci-fi and fantasy flicks. The hyper-cute animals make it a treat for kids and pet lovers alike, and the faux James Bond feel at the start and end is oddly thrilling. (I also like the promotion of choosing a rescue pet! Mutts over purebreds any day is my motto.)All in all, just another superlative animated film from the bumper crop of the past few years.

The film is about love, friendship, loyalty, and devotion, concepts that are sandwiched within this wonderful adventure story.The main character, a dog named Bolt, is the star of a hit television show with his owner, Penny, a young girl who is always living on the edge of danger. Thanks to Bolt's super powers, however, she is kept safe. The only thing is that Bolt has no idea he really does not have super powers and that his beloved Penny is never really in any danger. His life is a carefully constructed lie made for prime time, thanks to the wizardry of special effects. In this respect, it is somewhat reminiscent of the film ""The Truman Show""When Bolt escapes from his special studio lot trailer, thinking Penny is once again in danger, Bolt finds himself in the real world and gets a serious reality check, learning quite a bit about life and himself, while on the road to being reunited with  Penny. Along the way, he meets and is befriended by two wonderful characters, Mittens, a scrawny, cynical, tough-talking alley cat, and Rhino, the most adorable plump and juicy hamster the viewer could ever want to meet and a huge fan of Bolt. They join Bolt on his journey and have a number of hilarious adventures.The film is both funny and heartwarming. The characters are fully fleshed, with distinct, recognizable personalities. The script is intelligent and well-thought out, and the animation is first-rate.  This is definitely entertainment that is enjoyable for the whole family.

Thanks to no rehearsals or reshoots, Bolt (John Travolta) doesn't suspect that his powers come through trickery.When the network insists that the TV show becomes edgier to attract the young adult crowd, the writers come up with a cliffhanger that leaves Penny and Bolt separated.  But Bolt doesn't understand and escapes his trailer to rescue his human.  Packed up and shipped from Los Angeles to New York, Bolt is on a mission.  Kidnapping an ally cat named Mittens (Susie Essman) and teaming up with a hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton) who lives in a ball, Bolt sets out cross country.  Will he learn his powers aren't real?

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","Take Homeward Bound's tale of three pets drawn together on an epic journey across America, mix in Toy Story's winking sense of irony at the faux world of toys, shroud it in the artificially-created world of The Truman Show and you've got Bolt.Bolt (John Travolta) is a clueless acting dog who truly loves his ""person,"" Penny (Miley Cyrus). In the movies, Bolt is a superhero, but Bolt doesn't quite grasp that he's actually in a movie.  When audiences begin to tire of Bolt's heroics, the network decides to throw in a twist and separate Penny from Bolt.  Distraught and determined, Bolt escapes the studio in a quest to rescue Penny from Hollywood.Along the way, he meets a street savvy cat named Mittens (Susie Essman) and a chubby fanboy gerbil named Rhino (Mark Walton).  Rhino's a lot like Kung Fu Panda's Po - overweight, hopelessly consumed by fandom, and relentlessly optimistic. Mittens, on the other hand, is the Bones equivalent; a beaten down cynic who thinks Bolt is completely insane.Bolt is at its best during the film-within-a-film sequences; the motorcycle chase scene is just as thrilling as the one in Terminator Salvation.  The catch is that though it's not real, the violence takes place on screen.  In other words, does it really matter if CGI actors are pretending to be CGI dead? Helicopters explode, motorcycles flip, and bad guys don't get back up.  In that regard, Bolt's pretty violent.Where Michael J. Fox voice perfectly embodied Chance in Homeward Bound as a young pup, Travolta's throaty whisper seems an odd choice for Bolt, who's at least as clueless as Chance. He does a great job, but occasionally you can hear the weariness and maturity in his voice.Occasionally, the movie glosses over its own moral arc; although it's critical for Bolt to reunite with his person and Mittens still nurses her own emotional wounds over the loss of her family, Rhino leaves his old lady without nary a look back.  It's never mentioned that she might miss him.But those are minor quibbles.  Overall, Bolt's an entertaining, fast-moving action picture.

But he is the only one who doesn't know that his world is all a TV show. On his mission to rescue his beloved human, Bolt is accidentally shipped across the country to New York City, and getting back to Hollywood is no easy trip when you think you have superpowers and a sinister organization is plotting against you. Bolt manages to secure some help along the way from streetwise pigeons, an alley cat named Mittens, and a super-fanboy hamster named Rhino, but the group will not only have time and distance against them, they'll also have to deal with Bolt's discovery that he is just a regular dog after all.Disney's latest animated feature (at review time, March '09) is a supercharged CGI delight that thankfully restores much of the studio's reputation for top-notch toons, at least enough to hold us over until ""The Princess and the Frog"" is released. ""Bolt"" is not going to win many points for originality of plot. It basically combines ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" with the two ""Toy Story"" films and a ""Truman Show"" setup. Still, it works, and after all, ""A Bug's Life"" was excellent and yet a nearly complete plot copy of ""The Three Amigos"". The fact is, only a few movies truly have original plots. ""Bolt"" makes up for it with gorgeous visuals, fun and funny characters, and plenty of heart. Gotta love those pigeons! Bolt is well voiced by John Travolta, with Susie Essman as Mittens, and animator Mark Walton as the hilarious Rhino, and of course one can't forget Miley ""Hannah Montana"" Cyrus as Bolt's owner, Penny. Penny's a cute character, but Miley sounded a bit too old for the design in my opinion, leaving one to question the motives of her casting, but it's no big issue. Another interesting point though, is this makes at least 3 Disney animated little girls by the name of Penny... I wonder if they totally forgot about the others or just didn't care. Well, unimportant. The bottom-line is that Bolt is a very fun and entertaining picture. One can tell that PIXAR's new role within the Disney company had its effect on this film. Some folks may consider it too flashy and typical of the current animation trends to ever feel like a ""classic"", but while it may not have such a strikingly original look, I frankly find this one more appealing than ""Cars"", and I'm a big PIXAR fan. Plus, Bolt's characters are very strong and not too many to handle, and they manage to take the movie to a higher level than just another CGI animated feature. This one fits well in the PIXAR and Dreamworks ranks.The Blu-Ray currently comes as a 3-disc set, but understand that the 2nd and 3rd discs are just more copies of the film. Disc 2 is the standard DVD version of ""Bolt"", and Disc 3 is the Disney File digital copy, or as my friends and I call it, the coaster. Who needs it. I appreciate the addition of the standard def DVD though for use in the non-Blu-Ray players in the house (and for some I'm sure these are handy in the car). Anyway, as for the bonus features, they can all be found on Disc 1, and there really aren't as many as there should be. One imagines much more when they think of the build up Blu-Ray always gets. Still, there are some solid extras among them. We get 2 fine deleted scenes (story art format), a Miley Cyrus/John Travolta music video, a very brief behind the scenes on the video/song, a short behind the scenes featurette focusing on the directors (without getting into the nasty issues of Bolt's original director, Chris Sanders, who gave us Lilo and Stitch and now works for DreamWorks) and animator antics, another featurette on ""Creating the World of Bolt"" (a fine insight into the settings of the film and the detail put into them), and a third featurette on the voices of the film (though not all are mentioned; Malcolm McDowell, who played Dr. Calico, is a noteworthy absence), and there are also some great galleries and a surprisingly cool game! Oh, and did I mention the short cartoon, ""Super Rhino""? Really funny stuff!If you're a fan of Disney or animated films in general, not excluding CGI ones, this is a film that should be in your collection. Bolt's story may feel familiar, but it has its own take and is a fun, well-paced, humorous, and visually pleasing romp that has heart but doesn't get too sappy over it.

1222774,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B001OMU6UM,Moon Donkey,"[2, 2]","A great movie based on the traditional hero quest.  I'm surprised that this movie doesn't get more hype because it is one of the best.My kids love this movie.  In fact, I think it rates as one of their top 5 all-time favorites.  I suppose it helps that the main character is a dog - both boys and girls seem to relate well to animal movies.However, what I think really makes this movie great is its adherence to the traditional hero quest.  Bolt is separated from his home and undergoes an initiation before returning and saving the day.  In this case, I think that the writers did an excellent casting job casting a cat in the position of the teacher (Yoda) and the hamster as companion (Chewbacca).What's that you say?  This reviewer has flown the coop?  What's all this Yoda nonsense?  Be still your beating heart my friends and read Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces.  Or - perhaps just watch the PBS interview with Bill Moyers (even though Moyers is generally a raving fool). That pretty much explains it.  Note that the movie Spirit (about the horse) follows basically the same pattern.  Separation, initiation, return.Bolt also follows a Wizard of Oz pattern in the way he follows the map of pancake houses (yellow brick road) to his destination.  In this case, Oz being Hollywood.Bolt is really interesting because it handles the hero development in reverse - rather than leaving home to learn some mystical skill, Bolt does the opposite.  He is a superhero to begin with, only to leave home and discover his life is a lie.  Bolt's separation from home results in his transformation into a normal dog, not a super dog (unlike a character like Luke Skywalker for instance).  However, the beauty of this movie is that Bolt is a ""hero"" regardless.  You could argue that in some ways, Bolt perhaps does become a super dog of sorts - he goes from a make-believe hero to a real one.My black lab is a super dog too.  Her super power is eating entire loaves of bread off the kitchen counter.  She also hunts mice - kind of strange for a dog, but she is pretty good at it.All that aside, I highly recommend this movie to families with children 10 and under.

He's right.The reason for that is almost certainly the involvement of John Lasseter, who was the driving force behind the Pixar classics we've come to know, and more importantly-trust with our kids. He's now apparently with Disney, and the difference is immediately obvious. Bolt is absolutely wonderful from beginning to end. It's funny, exciting, heartwarming and witty enough at the adult level to entertain mom and dad as well.The last point is particularly important here. The Dreamworks method, and up till recently the Disney one for keeping adults in their seats has been the particularly lazy and offensive expedient of throwing-in enough sexual innuendo and fart gags to hopefully make mom and dad giggle. Assuming of course, that mom and dad have the class of Rosanne and the I.Q. of well....Rosanne.Thankfully, Pixar has always decided to take the higher and decidedly more creative route of, oh, actually writing a script filled with wit, cleverness and sincere heart. Those three things will trump vulgarity to any thoughtful parent and child every time. And just when you fear that America is becoming the world's largest trailer park, the success of these wonderful Pixar films reminds you that Hollywood, and the audience they ostensibly serve, are not entirely bankrupt of heart and ideas.Which happily brings us to Bolt. This really is the first film to come from a non-Pixar studio that is every bit as good as Finding Nemo, Cars, and Toy Story. The animation is jaw-dropping. The humor is sharp, the characters memorable, the action sequences exciting, and the lessons pure and simple; love, loyalty and courage. I can't imagine anyone not loving every moment of this film.While it was sadly, slightly overshadowed by the (to my mind) smug and preachy Wall-E, for anyone more interested in entertaining their child than indoctrinating them, you couldn't do better than this. If you're an admirer of Pixar's films, I think you'll find that the spirt lives in Bolt far more than in the lesser film that got all the critical sighs. Please give this a try for your kids, and watch it with them. I promise you'll smile, laugh, and cry...even if the TV does slightly enlarge your carbon footprint ;)",5,Thanks again Mr. Lasseter,1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,2419,"['accident', 'Bolt', 'first', 'non-Pixar', 'film', 'have', 'companys', 'magic', 'one', 'paper', 'aptly', 'said', 'first', 'Disney', 'offering', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'earned', 'sparkle', 'fairly', 'dust', 'logo', 'right.The', 'reason', 'almost', 'certainly', 'involvement', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'who', 'was', 'driving', 'force', 'Pixar', 'classics', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'more', 'importantly-trust', 'kids', 'now', 'apparently', 'Disney', 'difference', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'Bolt', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'beginning', 'end', 'funny', 'exciting', 'heartwarming', 'witty', 'enough', 'adult', 'level', 'entertain', 'mom', 'dad', 'well.The', 'last', 'point', 'particularly', 'important', 'here', 'Dreamworks', 'method', 'up', 'till', 'recently', 'Disney', 'one', 'keeping', 'adults', 'seats', 'been', 'particularly', 'lazy', 'offensive', 'expedient', 'throwing-in', 'enough', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'fart', 'gags', 'hopefully', 'make', 'mom', 'dad', 'giggle', 'Assuming', 'course', 'mom', 'dad', 'have', 'class', 'Rosanne', 'I.Q', 'well', '.Rosanne.Thankfully', 'Pixar', 'always', 'decided', 'take', 'higher', 'decidedly', 'more', 'creative', 'route', 'oh', 'actually', 'writing', 'script', 'filled', 'wit', 'cleverness', 'sincere', 'heart', 'three', 'things', 'will', 'trump', 'vulgarity', 'thoughtful', 'parent', 'child', 'time', 'just', 'when', 'fear', 'America', 'becoming', 'world', 'largest', 'trailer', 'park', 'success', 'wonderful', 'Pixar', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'audience', 'ostensibly', 'serve', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'heart', 'ideas.Which', 'happily', 'Bolt', 'really', 'first', 'film', 'come', 'non-Pixar', 'studio', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Cars', 'Toy', 'Story', 'animation', 'jaw-dropping', 'humor', 'sharp', 'characters', 'memorable', 'action', 'exciting', 'lessons', 'pure', 'simple', 'loyalty', 'courage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'loving', 'moment', 'film.While', 'was', 'sadly', 'slightly', 'overshadowed', 'mind', 'smug', 'preachy', 'Wall-E', 'anyone', 'more', 'interested', 'entertaining', 'child', 'indoctrinating', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', ""'re"", 'admirer', 'Pixar', 'films', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'spirt', 'Bolt', 'far', 'more', 'lesser', 'film', 'got', 'critical', 'sighs', 'Please', 'give', 'try', 'kids', 'watch', 'promise', ""'ll"", 'smile', 'laugh', 'cry', 'even', 'TV', 'slightly', 'enlarge', 'carbon', 'footprint']",Bolt

It's predictable, to be sure.  In fact, some of it reminds me of Disney's other recent dog film, ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua,"" in that a dog is removed from a somewhat priviliged background and forced to live like a regular dog.  Like any good animal movie, Bolt meets friends along the way.  Upstaging Bolt is Rhino, a hamster who worships Bolt and moves around in a little plastic ball.What Disney has succeeded in doing is injecting a little heart back into their product.  It's something they've really not been able to successfully do since ""Lilo and Stitch.""  There's a really touching scene between Bolt and a stray cat named Mittens that not only captures the heart of the film, but really makes you think twice about animal abandonment!Performances are good all around and the animation is top notch.  For some reason, I feel that Disney still wants to compete against their own partner Pixar.  Still, the characters aren't quite as multidimensional.  And considering the hero's plight to get back to his owner Penny, Penny really gets little time in this. The film has a fun road movie quality and the film makers seemed to have fun with the action sequences. It's a fun watch, but pretty far from Pixar quality.",4,"Predictable, but Disney is starting to hold their own again",1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,1546,"['having', 'far', 'superior', 'product', 'distribution', 'Pixar', 'Disney', 'still', 'churn', 'out', 'own', 'animation', 'days', 'golden', 'days', 'yesteryear', 'are', 'gone', 'resurgence', 'back', 'early', '90s', 'are', 'long', 'nice', 'see', 'disney', 'put', 'out', 'couple', 'good', 'titles', 'here', 'there', 'Bolt', 'pretty', 'good', 'predictable', 'be', 'sure', 'fact', 'Disney', 'other', 'recent', 'dog', 'film', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Chihuahua', 'dog', 'removed', 'somewhat', 'priviliged', 'background', 'forced', 'live', 'regular', 'dog', 'good', 'animal', 'movie', 'Bolt', 'way', 'Upstaging', 'Bolt', 'Rhino', 'hamster', 'who', 'Bolt', 'moves', 'around', 'little', 'plastic', 'Disney', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'injecting', 'little', 'heart', 'back', 'product', 'something', ""'ve"", 'really', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'successfully', 'do', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'really', 'touching', 'scene', 'Bolt', 'stray', 'cat', 'named', 'Mittens', 'not', 'only', 'heart', 'film', 'really', 'think', 'twice', 'animal', 'abandonment', 'Performances', 'are', 'good', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'reason', 'feel', 'Disney', 'still', 'compete', 'own', 'partner', 'Pixar', 'Still', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'multidimensional', 'considering', 'hero', 'plight', 'get', 'back', 'owner', 'Penny', 'Penny', 'really', 'little', 'time', 'film', 'fun', 'road', 'movie', 'quality', 'film', 'makers', 'seemed', 'have', 'fun', 'action', 'sequences', 'fun', 'watch', 'pretty', 'far', 'Pixar', 'quality']",Bolt

1222802,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001OMU6UM,Robert Moore,"[2, 3]","If you want to get BOLT -- and why wouldn't you? -- then you should definitely get the version that features both the Blu-ray and regular DVD discs.  I have a Blu-ray player on both my laptop and my PS3, but visiting my parents I was nonetheless able to show this to the homefolk on a regular DVD player.  I love Blu-ray, but unless I leave it at home and watch things there, I'm unable to share my discs with others.  The fact is that one of the greatest things about owning Blu-ray or DVDs is being able to share them in social situations.  Get this edition and you are set to show the movie in the best possible format depending on the hardware available.The film itself is well worth seeing, a lot of fun for both children and adults.  Although Disney and Pixar have an alliance, we usually associate CGI films with Pixar.  BOLT, however, is a non-Pixar related Disney release.  In terms of visual quality the film more than holds its own with Pixar.  In content it might be slightly more oriented to a younger viewer, but not by much.  If the Pixar films are actually adult films that kids can also enjoy, this is the reverse.  One other comment on the CGI aspect of the film is that it is not 100% CGI.  Or at least I don't think so.  There are some spots where background paintings were employed instead of CGI, or at the very least the CGI was used to simulate background paintings.  At any rate, the effect was interesting.The story involves a dog, Bolt, who was adopted from a pet store as a puppy by Penny.  However, Bolt was used as a actor in a live action television series, starring as a dog with super powers.  The entire long opening sequence where Bolt is putting all his super powers on display is a total hoot, though the pacing immediately suggested that something was amiss.  My first guess was that the whole thing was a fantasy or dream sequence.  But as soon as we learn that the studio was involved in an elaborate effort to convince Bolt that he actually did have super powers (in order to make his acting more convincing), we sense that Bolt was not exactly a happy dog.  Convinced that he had to perpetually save Penny from danger, he was a bit too vigilant to have fun or be happy.  But when through a series of misunderstandings Bolt believes that Penny has in fact been abducted, he begins a real cross country rescue mission to save his person.The sequences of the film devoted to Bolt both traveling across country and discovering (much like Buzz Lightyear in TOY STORY) that he didn't have the powers he thought he had involve his traveling by a variety of means from NYC to Hollywood.  He forces a streetwise cat (Mittens) to assist him, picking up along the way a hamster in a ball named Rhino, whose growl and courage surpass his considerable girth.  From beginning to end, the journey and all the antics in which they are all involved are a total hoot.I'm not a Miley Cyrus fan (guys, I have to go with Radiohead on this), and although we have to listen to one of her songs, she isn't too bothersome as Penny.  Of course, for young girls her presence in the film will be a positive.  John Travolta is great voicing Bolt and often sounds almost nothing like his usual self.  Susie Essman of CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM is splendid in what is in fact the true female lead, providing the voice for the cranky cat Mittens.  And after recently discovering what a fine voiceover artist Malcolm McDowell could be in the hit game FALLOUT 3 (as President John Henry Eden), he is superb here as Dr. Calico.All in all, this was a great movie that both kids and adults can enjoy.  But definitely make sure to get the Blu-ray + DVD edition.  The price makes it a bargain and you get not one, not two, but three versions of the movie, the third being a Digital Copy for use on iPods or computers.  I hope more companies follow Disney's example here and provide multiple formats.  All of these factors make this a must-buy set.",5,Definitely get the Blu-ray + DVD edition,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,3944,"['want', 'get', 'BOLT', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'get', 'version', 'Blu-ray', 'regular', 'DVD', 'discs', 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'laptop', 'PS3', 'visiting', 'parents', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'able', 'show', 'homefolk', 'regular', 'DVD', 'player', 'love', 'Blu-ray', 'leave', 'home', 'watch', 'things', 'there', ""'m"", 'unable', 'share', 'discs', 'others', 'fact', 'one', 'greatest', 'things', 'owning', 'Blu-ray', 'DVDs', 'being', 'able', 'share', 'social', 'situations', 'Get', 'edition', 'are', 'set', 'show', 'movie', 'best', 'possible', 'format', 'depending', 'hardware', 'available.The', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'lot', 'fun', 'children', 'adults', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'have', 'alliance', 'usually', 'associate', 'CGI', 'films', 'Pixar', 'BOLT', 'however', 'non-Pixar', 'related', 'Disney', 'release', 'terms', 'visual', 'quality', 'film', 'more', 'own', 'Pixar', 'content', 'might', 'be', 'slightly', 'more', 'oriented', 'younger', 'viewer', 'not', 'much', 'Pixar', 'films', 'are', 'actually', 'adult', 'films', 'kids', 'can', 'also', 'enjoy', 'reverse', 'One', 'other', 'comment', 'CGI', 'aspect', 'film', 'not', '100', '%', 'CGI', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'are', 'spots', 'where', 'background', 'paintings', 'were', 'employed', 'instead', 'CGI', 'very', 'least', 'CGI', 'was', 'used', 'simulate', 'background', 'paintings', 'rate', 'effect', 'was', 'interesting.The', 'story', 'dog', 'Bolt', 'who', 'was', 'adopted', 'pet', 'store', 'puppy', 'Penny', 'However', 'Bolt', 'was', 'used', 'actor', 'live', 'action', 'television', 'series', 'starring', 'dog', 'super', 'powers', 'entire', 'long', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'Bolt', 'putting', 'super', 'powers', 'display', 'total', 'hoot', 'pacing', 'immediately', 'suggested', 'something', 'was', 'amiss', 'first', 'guess', 'was', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'fantasy', 'dream', 'sequence', 'as', 'soon', 'learn', 'studio', 'was', 'involved', 'elaborate', 'effort', 'convince', 'Bolt', 'actually', 'did', 'have', 'super', 'powers', 'order', 'make', 'acting', 'more', 'convincing', 'sense', 'Bolt', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'happy', 'dog', 'Convinced', 'had', 'perpetually', 'save', 'Penny', 'danger', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'vigilant', 'have', 'fun', 'be', 'happy', 'when', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'Bolt', 'Penny', 'fact', 'been', 'abducted', 'real', 'cross', 'country', 'rescue', 'mission', 'save', 'person.The', 'sequences', 'film', 'devoted', 'Bolt', 'traveling', 'country', 'discovering', 'much', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'TOY', 'STORY', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'powers', 'thought', 'had', 'involve', 'traveling', 'variety', 'means', 'NYC', 'Hollywood', 'streetwise', 'cat', 'Mittens', 'assist', 'picking', 'up', 'way', 'hamster', 'ball', 'named', 'Rhino', 'growl', 'courage', 'surpass', 'considerable', 'girth', 'beginning', 'end', 'journey', 'antics', 'are', 'involved', 'are', 'total', 'hoot.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'fan', 'guys', 'have', 'go', 'Radiohead', 'have', 'listen', 'one', 'songs', ""n't"", 'too', 'bothersome', 'Penny', 'course', 'young', 'girls', 'presence', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'positive', 'John', 'Travolta', 'great', 'voicing', 'Bolt', 'often', 'almost', 'nothing', 'usual', 'self', 'Susie', 'Essman', 'CURB', 'YOUR', 'ENTHUSIASM', 'splendid', 'what', 'fact', 'true', 'female', 'lead', 'providing', 'voice', 'cranky', 'cat', 'Mittens', 'recently', 'discovering', 'what', 'fine', 'voiceover', 'artist', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'could', 'be', 'hit', 'game', 'FALLOUT', '3', 'President', 'John', 'Henry', 'Eden', 'superb', 'here', 'Dr.', 'Calico.All', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'kids', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'definitely', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'DVD', 'edition', 'price', 'bargain', 'get', 'not', 'one', 'not', 'two', 'three', 'versions', 'movie', 'third', 'being', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'use', 'iPods', 'computers', 'hope', 'more', 'companies', 'follow', 'Disney', 'example', 'here', 'provide', 'multiple', 'formats', 'factors', 'make', 'must-buy', 'set']",Bolt
1222803,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B001OMU6UM,Robert Morris,"[0, 0]","Frankly, I did not know what to expect when I took three grandchildren to see this film immediately after it arrived in Dallas months ago. We saw it at an IMAX theater in 3-D, an experience that reminded me of a time when (at their age) I was startled when Vincent Price began to hit a rubber ball with a wooden paddle at me and others in the audience at the Shore theatre in Chicago. This time around, I was soon unaware of the paper glasses and concentrated on an especially clever plot. Briefly, Bolt (voice of John Travolta) has become a celebrity dog because of his appearances on a television show during which (through special effects) he demonstrates super-canine powers when opposing evil forces in various forms, especially those that threaten his beloved owner, Penny (voice of Miley Cyrus). Bolt is convinced that he indeed possesses these powers. After all, he can ""see"" himself in action on film. And then, for reasons best revealed during a screening, Bolt and Penny are separated (a recurrent theme in most of Disney's feature animated films) and he must overcome all manner of obstacles to become reunited with her, another familiar Disney theme.Of course, he collects some eccentric but likeable companions along the way.I was especially impressed by the co-directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams keep the plot moving along at a lively pace and credit the screenplay's co-writers, Dan Fogelman (also the voice of Billy) and Chris Williams (another voice) with producing consistently entertaining dialog.  It's always fun to try to recognize the voices provided to animated characters. Other than those of other than Travolta and Cyrus, the only other significant voices I recognized were James Lipton's as The Director and Malcolm McDowell's as Dr. Calico. Lipton is best known for his association with the Actors Studio (he conducts the interviews on PBS) and McDowell was unforgettable as the character Alex in Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film, A Clockwork Orange.The quality of this film's production values is very high. I especially enjoyed watching it in 3D and expect most (if not all) animated features to introduced in 3D. As is also true of so many other animated features produced by Disney's Pixar as well as DreamWorks, Bolt appeals to those of all ages. The special features that accompany the film in both DVD and Blu-ray formats (my copy is DVD only) really are special. They include an animated short film, ""Super Rhino,"" and deleted scenes as well as several featurettes: ""In Session with John Travolta and Miley Cyrus,"" ""A New Breed of Director: The Filmmakers' Journey"" and ""Act, Speak! The Voices of Bolt.""As indicated, I really enjoyed seeing this film again as well as seeing the special features provided with it. I think Bolt is a worthy companion of Disney's other action/adventure animated features, notably The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under, and also resembles Disney's Pinocchio, Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland, and Peter Pan in terms of its themes of separation and  ""grace under duress."" Also, its clever use of loyal companions throughout a sometimes perilous journey before reaching a reunion or reconciliation of some kind. However, unlike most of these films, it has no scenes that may upset younger children. True to the studio's founder, Disney's animated features also affirm certain basic values of enduring importance. For Bolt, it means possessing authentic courage rather than the illusion of it.",5,An especially enjoyable film for younger children,1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,3457,"['Frankly', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'took', 'three', 'grandchildren', 'see', 'film', 'immediately', 'arrived', 'Dallas', 'months', 'ago', 'saw', 'IMAX', 'theater', '3-D', 'experience', 'reminded', 'time', 'when', 'age', 'was', 'startled', 'when', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'began', 'hit', 'rubber', 'ball', 'wooden', 'paddle', 'others', 'audience', 'Shore', 'theatre', 'Chicago', 'time', 'was', 'soon', 'unaware', 'paper', 'glasses', 'concentrated', 'especially', 'clever', 'plot', 'Briefly', 'Bolt', 'voice', 'John', 'Travolta', 'become', 'celebrity', 'dog', 'appearances', 'television', 'show', 'special', 'effects', 'super-canine', 'powers', 'when', 'opposing', 'evil', 'forces', 'various', 'forms', 'especially', 'threaten', 'beloved', 'owner', 'Penny', 'voice', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'Bolt', 'convinced', 'indeed', 'powers', 'can', 'see', 'action', 'film', 'then', 'reasons', 'best', 'revealed', 'screening', 'Bolt', 'Penny', 'are', 'separated', 'recurrent', 'theme', 'most', 'Disney', 'feature', 'animated', 'films', 'must', 'overcome', 'manner', 'obstacles', 'become', 'reunited', 'familiar', 'Disney', 'theme.Of', 'course', 'eccentric', 'likeable', 'companions', 'way.I', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'co-directors', 'Byron', 'Howard', 'Chris', 'Williams', 'keep', 'plot', 'moving', 'along', 'lively', 'pace', 'credit', 'screenplay', 'co-writers', 'Dan', 'Fogelman', 'also', 'voice', 'Billy', 'Chris', 'Williams', 'voice', 'producing', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'dialog', 'always', 'fun', 'try', 'recognize', 'voices', 'provided', 'animated', 'characters', 'Other', 'other', 'Travolta', 'Cyrus', 'only', 'other', 'significant', 'voices', 'recognized', 'were', 'James', 'Lipton', 'Director', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Dr.', 'Calico', 'Lipton', 'best', 'known', 'association', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'interviews', 'PBS', 'McDowell', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'Alex', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '1971', 'film', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange.The', 'quality', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'very', 'high', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'watching', '3D', 'expect', 'most', 'not', 'animated', 'features', 'introduced', '3D', 'also', 'true', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'animated', 'features', 'produced', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'as', 'well', 'DreamWorks', 'Bolt', 'appeals', 'ages', 'special', 'features', 'accompany', 'film', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'formats', 'copy', 'DVD', 'only', 'really', 'are', 'special', 'include', 'animated', 'short', 'film', 'Super', 'Rhino', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'featurettes', 'Session', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'New', 'Breed', 'Director', 'Filmmakers', 'Journey', 'Act', 'Speak', 'Voices', 'Bolt', 'indicated', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'film', 'again', 'as', 'well', 'seeing', 'special', 'features', 'provided', 'think', 'Bolt', 'worthy', 'companion', 'Disney', 'other', 'action/adventure', 'animated', 'features', 'notably', 'Rescuers', 'Rescuers', 'Down', 'also', 'Disney', 'Pinocchio', 'Dumbo', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'terms', 'themes', 'separation', 'grace', 'duress', 'Also', 'clever', 'use', 'loyal', 'companions', 'sometimes', 'perilous', 'journey', 'reaching', 'reunion', 'reconciliation', 'kind', 'However', 'most', 'films', 'scenes', 'may', 'upset', 'younger', 'children', 'True', 'studio', 'founder', 'Disney', 'animated', 'features', 'also', 'affirm', 'certain', 'basic', 'values', 'enduring', 'importance', 'Bolt', 'possessing', 'authentic', 'courage', 'rather', 'illusion']",Bolt

The story picks up when his owner is kidnapped, on the set of the show, and Bolt leaves the set in search of her.

1222816,A3TDJYEQCXG1DA,B001OMU6UM,Sera69,"[17, 49]","I wanted to like this. I really did. But it offers nothing new. Nothing at all. And, i have to say, for the first hour the lead character is totally unsympathetic, with no redeeming warmth at all.And the set-up, i feel, is completely blown by the first (very good) action scene. How would it be possible in any way at all to film that scene without the dog knowing it wasn't real? And i realise this is a cartoon, and that i shouldn't take everything quite so seriously but this is the premise for the entire film: that Bolt doesn't know he's on TV. Yet, if this were true, that scene is utterly unfilmable.Sorry, but it's a big, big, big, big, big plot hole; one of many to be honest.Anyway, our hero finds himself lost, alone and a long way from home. He enlists a couple of comedy sidekicks to help him get home, well, actually he kidnaps one (highly un-PC treatment towards the cat, btw), the other is a psychotic Scrappy-Doo. He travels across the country. Has a crisis of confidence when he realises he's not so super after all. Gets the toe curling pep speech common to at least 90% of Disney movies: ""The world needs a hero and YOU! are that hero!"" and sorts himself out. Then...The worst of all, the 'You came back for me. Why did you come back for me?' bit about an hour into the film when Bolt goes back to rescue the cat he kidnapped. It's a horrible moment of cinema. Clich&eacute;d does not even come close to the horror of suffering through that.Suddenly everyone is friends and the journey home continues. But there's another crisis of confidence. Bolt's whole life has been a sham and maybe he is just not needed anymore. Pep talk... Confidence restored off Bolt goes and arrives just in time to rescue his owner from a perilous, death is certain, situation and become a real life hero... Ahh...It says something about the movie when the best lines, best comedy and best scenes all come from the supporting cast. The pigeons are the Three Amigos, the rodent is a 'lemme-at-'em!' Scrappy-Doo with some cool post-modern hang-ups and the humans are too incredibly stupid to be taken as 'whole' believable characters. Bolt is just an unsympathetic Buzz Lightyear (imagine Toy Story if Buzz played it straight for three quarters of the film, but without any ensuing comedy.)To be fair, i watched this twice, i really gave it a go, but the second time was with a distinct feeling of being cheated. Bolt is 'cut & paste' Disney by numbers and a perfect example of why the industry needs producers like Pixar. Bolt lacks the humour, the invention, the characterisation, the story, the depth, the irony, the quality and the FUN of a Pixar movie (tho, it does look fantastic). Ok, I'm being harsh on a cute cartoon but Bolt is still the wax apple next to Pixars healthy real thing.Young kids raised on E-numbers and MRM will love it, it's all style over substance, Disney fans will love it cause they buy Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2. But it made me grimace more than it made me smile. And i didn't laugh once.

Hannah Montana fans will be happy that Miley Cyrus, has a voice in this movie, but how about the rest of us? What Bolt does lack, is orginal. Films have been seen like this, where a dog gets lost. But of course you will want to know if the movie is worth your time, and my opinion it is, while somebody else's opinions it is not, so you will have to decide for yourself. The movie begins with a young Penny (Chloe Moretz) goes to a pet shop and buys a dog. And she names him Bolt, then the movie jumps to 5 years later, where Penny (Miley Cyrus) and Bolt (John Travolta) are on a set of a TV show filming an epsiode, in which her TV dad (Sean Donnellan) is kidnapped by the TV show's villian Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell), and she has to go to rescue him. When filming ends, Penny takes Bolt back to his trailer, he never leaves the set, and some of the people with the show, including the director (James Lipton) wants the show to be real to Bolt, and he worries while looking at film, discovers a boom mike on film. While a woman named Mindy (Kari Wahlgren) from the network doesn't care about the boom mike, and is more worried about the ratings for the show. Meanwhile Penny decides that she wants to take Bolt home for the weekend, and she apporaches her own Mom (Grey Delisle) with the idea, but her agent (Greg Germann) is against the idea. So after filming of the next episode, in which Penny gets kidnapped on the show, Bolt who doesn't know that she is really alright, is so worried sick. And when his door on top of the trailer is opened, he manges to get out to find her, with leads him to be accidently packed in a box with styrofoam peanuts. And he ends up in New York City, a long way from Hollywood, where the show is filmed. He meets up with a couple of clueless piegons, that knows that he looks familar, but can't figure where or why he looks familar. Then he meets up with Mittens (Susie Essman) a felmale alley cat, that he assumes to be apart of Penny's disappearance, and also assumes that she works for the villain of the show, that he doesn't know by name, but only as the green eyed man. And when she sees on his name tag, that says Hollywood, she shows him a map, that they are in New York, and he has to get to Hollywood, or right by a waffle on the map. And he forces her to take the trip with him.

Penny, his person, and the heroine from the show wants Bolt to be able to be a real dog and come home with her for the weekend. The money grubbing agent of course will have nothing to do with that idea.The network says that research shows Bolt is too predictable and is boring people in their target age group. Penny gets in trouble and Bolt always saves her. So they put in a twist, Penny gets in trouble and Bolt doesn't save her. After the show Penny is panicked because they won't let her see Bolt, and she knows he's going to be freaking out thinking she is in trouble, which of course he is. He gets out of his trailer, hits his head trying to escape the building and is knocked unconscious into a box of pink Styrofoam and gets shipped to New York.When he wakes up, he is searching for Penny, and doesn't know he's not on the set and doesn't have super powers. The contrast of his belief he is a superhero with real life sets up lots of funny scenes throughout the movie. He meets some pigeons, which is a reoccurring theme in the movie. The pigeons always have a pronounced accent and clear local sayings and behaviors that are quite funny. These pigeons introduce him to a jaded cat named Mittens that Bold believes works for the villain from the TV show. She explains to him that he has to get from New York to California to find Penny. Against her wishes they set off across country to find Penny.They pick up a funny hamster in a ball on the way named Rhino. He's a huge fan of Bolt's TV show and that is how Mittens, and eventually Bolt figure out that he's not truly a superhero. There are so many funny scenes that it may be in the Disney humor realm with the greats likeToy Story (10th Anniversary Edition),Monsters, Inc. (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),Cars (Widescreen Edition), andMulan (Special Edition).  I'll need to see it a few more times to know for sure, but it's at least close.There are of course several tear jerking scenes as Bolt discovers he is just a dog, the truth about Mittens and when he thinks Penny doesn't really love him. But in true Disney fashion, he rises above his limitations and is more than he knows. The ending is great, and the pigeons make a final appearance indicating what part of the country they're in.This is a movie I preordered because I will enjoy it as much as my children, and when they watch it every day in the car for two weeks, I'll laugh at the lines right along with them.",5,Great Disney humor,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,2595,"['Bolt', 'character', 'TV', 'show', 'producers', 'think', 'most', 'emotion', 'filled', 'believable', 'animal', 'actor', 'ever', 'seen', 'Penny', 'person', 'heroine', 'show', 'Bolt', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'real', 'dog', 'come', 'home', 'weekend', 'money', 'grubbing', 'agent', 'course', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'idea.The', 'network', 'research', 'shows', 'Bolt', 'too', 'predictable', 'boring', 'people', 'target', 'age', 'group', 'Penny', 'trouble', 'Bolt', 'always', 'put', 'twist', 'Penny', 'trouble', 'Bolt', ""n't"", 'save', 'show', 'Penny', 'panicked', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'see', 'Bolt', 'going', 'be', 'freaking', 'out', 'thinking', 'trouble', 'course', 'trailer', 'head', 'trying', 'escape', 'building', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'box', 'pink', 'Styrofoam', 'shipped', 'New', 'York.When', 'up', 'searching', 'Penny', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'set', ""n't"", 'have', 'super', 'powers', 'contrast', 'belief', 'superhero', 'real', 'life', 'up', 'lots', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'pigeons', 'reoccurring', 'theme', 'movie', 'pigeons', 'always', 'have', 'pronounced', 'accent', 'clear', 'local', 'sayings', 'behaviors', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'pigeons', 'introduce', 'jaded', 'cat', 'named', 'Mittens', 'Bold', 'works', 'villain', 'TV', 'show', 'get', 'New', 'York', 'California', 'find', 'Penny', 'Against', 'wishes', 'set', 'off', 'country', 'find', 'Penny.They', 'pick', 'up', 'funny', 'hamster', 'ball', 'way', 'named', 'Rhino', 'huge', 'fan', 'Bolt', 'TV', 'show', 'how', 'Mittens', 'eventually', 'Bolt', 'figure', 'out', 'not', 'truly', 'superhero', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'Disney', 'humor', 'realm', 'greats', 'likeToy', 'Story', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Cars', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andMulan', 'Special', 'Edition', ""'ll"", 'need', 'see', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'know', 'sure', 'least', 'are', 'course', 'several', 'tear', 'jerking', 'scenes', 'Bolt', 'just', 'dog', 'truth', 'Mittens', 'when', 'Penny', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'true', 'Disney', 'fashion', 'limitations', 'more', 'ending', 'great', 'pigeons', 'make', 'final', 'appearance', 'indicating', 'what', 'part', 'country', ""'re"", 'in.This', 'movie', 'preordered', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'children', 'when', 'watch', 'day', 'car', 'two', 'weeks', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'lines', 'right']",Bolt

I am giving it 4+ stars because I have seen better animated movies - the bar is pretty high - but I do recommend it.Clarification on ""mildly disturbing"":The story is about a dog who thinks he has a home, and a family consisting of the girl, and who thinks he is a super-dog. He then finds out that the girl is just an actor and that he was living in a fake reality - he is not a superdog either.

1222833,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001OMU6UM,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Disney's ""Bolt"" is about a dog of the title with incredible superpowers. Bolt is always there to aid his master, a girl named Penny, whose father is kidnapped by an evil organization led by Dr. Calico. Brave and strong Bolt never fails Penny, saves her from danger, using his great powers. But there is one thing Bolt doesn't know: the world he thinks is real is actually the set of a TV show made in Hollywood.Things change drastically, however, when Bolt is accidentally sent to New York City. This is the beginning of the real adventures for him and two animals he meets on the way, a cat named Mittens and a hamster named Rhino, and on the way home Bolt's courage will be tested.The film's story is a blend of ""The Truman Show"" and any films featuring a dog coming back to his/her home - like two classics ""Lassie Come Home"" and ""Incredible Journey"" - and it works with good narrative pace and first-rate visuals. The best part of the film is the fast-paced, thrilling film-within-film segment, the hair-raising ""Bolt"" show where you can see Bolt running like a real super-dog should do. (One character says the ratings of ""Bolt"" are falling. I just don't believe that.)Despite its unique premises about the TV show and its canine star, the storyline of ""Bolt"" is orthodox, just like any good family pictures.

1222834,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001OMU6UM,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","I admit that I really wasn't that excited to see BOLT.  An animal road trip movie featuring the voices of John Travolta and Miley Cyrus?  It really didn't sound that interesting to me.  However, I was wrong.  BOLT is a much more entertaining and enjoyable movie than I expected and after viewing it I would gladly watch it again.Bolt (John Travolta) is the star of his own tv show with his owner, Penny (Miley Cyrus).  In the show, Penny's dad is a world-class scientist who is wanted by an evil mastermind named Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell).  Knowing that he won't always be around to protect his daughter, Penny's father genetically alters Bolt giving him superpowers such as heat vision, lasers that shoot from his eyes, super strength, super endurance, and a super bark that works as a sonic weapon. It makes for a highly entertaining adventure show that has made Penny and Bolt into stars.  The only catch is that Bolt thinks that the world of the television show is real life.  Each day after filming Penny takes him to his trailer where he is locked in for the night.  Penny wants to bring him home for a weekend, but her agent and the producers won't allow it.  When a studio representative threatens to shut the production of ""Bolt"" down if the ratings don't garner enough of the key 13-25 year-old graphic, the Director (James Lipton) writes a cliffhanger episode that ends with Penny being captured by Dr. Calico.  Bolt thinks it's for real and attempts to rescue Penny, but accidentally gets shut up in a box and sent across the country to New York.  Taking a stray cat named Mittons (Susie Essman) as his hostage, Bolt begins his cross-country odyssey to find Penny.  Halfway through the trip they are joined by a hamster in his exercise ball named Rhino (Mark Walton).  It's a trip that will change each of their lives forever. And even though the movie is named BOLT, Rhino is the real star of the film.The plot isn't exactly new, but it is told in a fresh and engaging way.  I think this has a lot to do because of John Lasseter and new directors Byron Howard & Chris Williams.  Even if BOLT was just an average picture, it would be noteworthy because it's the first Disney film that Lasseter has produced since Pixar was brought under the Disney umbrella.  Disney animation has been lagging for years and with the addition of Pixar, Disney hoped that Lasseter and company would turn things around for them.  I also think that the fresh perspective of Howard & Williams also helped the production.In regards to animation, BOLT is extraordinary.  The landscapes and scenery are beautiful, but don't distract from the central action.  While watching the special features, I learned that this is because the backgrounds are actual paintings of real-world locations. These were filmed onto a frame and then the main action was animated over those scenes. Also, scenes and items that looked too perfect were made to look more real and lifelike. It's a combination of old style animation, but done using computer technology.The special features on the DVD include the short ""Super Rhino"" which shows what happens if Rhino had the same super powers as Bolt; two deleted scenes with introductions from directors Howard & Williams; the preview ""In Session with John Travolta & Miley Cyrus""; ""I Thought I LostYou"" music video; ""A New Breed of Directors"" featurette; ""Act, Speak! The Voices of Bolt"" featurette; ""Creating the World of BOLT"" featurette; and previews.  I really enjoyed the ""Voices"" featurette. Mark Walton is not a full-time actor but just works at Pixar/Disney. He's done a few voice before and did the voice for Rhino on the rough-cut of the film. It was planned to hire a professional actor to do Rhino's voice, but everyone loved Mark as Rhino. The ""Voices"" featurette includes footage of when Mark found out he had been hired as Rhino. The guy is quite talented and enthusiastic and I hope that he does more voices in the future.The Blu-ray version of the film also includes ""Bolt's Be-Awesome Mission"" which is a game using your remote and an Art gallery as well as a copy of the movie on DVD and a digital copy of the movie.",4,Disney BOLTs Toward the Future,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,4153,"['admit', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'excited', 'see', 'BOLT', 'animal', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'featuring', 'voices', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'interesting', 'However', 'was', 'wrong', 'BOLT', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'expected', 'viewing', 'would', 'gladly', 'watch', 'again.Bolt', 'John', 'Travolta', 'star', 'own', 'tv', 'show', 'owner', 'Penny', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'show', 'Penny', 'dad', 'world-class', 'scientist', 'who', 'wanted', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Calico', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Knowing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'always', 'be', 'protect', 'daughter', 'Penny', 'father', 'genetically', 'Bolt', 'giving', 'superpowers', 'such', 'heat', 'vision', 'lasers', 'shoot', 'eyes', 'super', 'strength', 'super', 'endurance', 'super', 'bark', 'sonic', 'weapon', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'adventure', 'show', 'made', 'Penny', 'Bolt', 'stars', 'only', 'catch', 'Bolt', 'world', 'television', 'show', 'real', 'life', 'day', 'filming', 'Penny', 'trailer', 'where', 'locked', 'night', 'Penny', 'bring', 'home', 'weekend', 'agent', 'producers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'When', 'studio', 'representative', 'shut', 'production', 'Bolt', 'down', 'ratings', 'do', ""n't"", 'garner', 'enough', 'key', '13-25', 'year-old', 'graphic', 'Director', 'James', 'Lipton', 'cliffhanger', 'episode', 'Penny', 'being', 'captured', 'Dr.', 'Calico', 'Bolt', 'real', 'attempts', 'rescue', 'Penny', 'accidentally', 'shut', 'up', 'box', 'sent', 'country', 'New', 'York', 'Taking', 'stray', 'cat', 'named', 'Mittons', 'Susie', 'Essman', 'hostage', 'Bolt', 'cross-country', 'odyssey', 'find', 'Penny', 'Halfway', 'trip', 'are', 'joined', 'hamster', 'exercise', 'ball', 'named', 'Rhino', 'Mark', 'Walton', 'trip', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'forever', 'even', 'movie', 'named', 'BOLT', 'Rhino', 'real', 'star', 'film.The', 'plot', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'new', 'told', 'fresh', 'engaging', 'way', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'new', 'directors', 'Byron', 'Howard', 'Chris', 'Williams', 'Even', 'BOLT', 'was', 'just', 'average', 'picture', 'would', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'first', 'Disney', 'film', 'Lasseter', 'produced', 'Pixar', 'was', 'brought', 'Disney', 'umbrella', 'Disney', 'animation', 'been', 'lagging', 'years', 'addition', 'Pixar', 'Disney', 'hoped', 'Lasseter', 'company', 'would', 'turn', 'things', 'also', 'think', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'Howard', 'Williams', 'also', 'helped', 'production.In', 'regards', 'animation', 'BOLT', 'extraordinary', 'landscapes', 'scenery', 'are', 'beautiful', 'do', ""n't"", 'distract', 'central', 'action', 'watching', 'special', 'features', 'learned', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'actual', 'paintings', 'real-world', 'locations', 'were', 'filmed', 'frame', 'then', 'main', 'action', 'was', 'animated', 'scenes', 'Also', 'scenes', 'items', 'looked', 'too', 'perfect', 'were', 'made', 'look', 'more', 'real', 'lifelike', 'combination', 'old', 'style', 'animation', 'done', 'using', 'computer', 'technology.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'short', 'Super', 'Rhino', 'what', 'Rhino', 'had', 'same', 'super', 'powers', 'Bolt', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'introductions', 'directors', 'Howard', 'Williams', 'preview', 'Session', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'Thought', 'LostYou', 'music', 'video', 'New', 'Breed', 'Directors', 'featurette', 'Act', 'Speak', 'Voices', 'Bolt', 'featurette', 'Creating', 'World', 'BOLT', 'featurette', 'previews', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Voices', 'featurette', 'Mark', 'Walton', 'not', 'full-time', 'actor', 'just', 'works', 'Pixar/Disney', 'done', 'few', 'voice', 'did', 'voice', 'Rhino', 'rough-cut', 'film', 'was', 'planned', 'hire', 'professional', 'actor', 'do', 'Rhino', 'voice', 'everyone', 'loved', 'Mark', 'Rhino', 'Voices', 'featurette', 'footage', 'when', 'Mark', 'found', 'had', 'been', 'hired', 'Rhino', 'guy', 'quite', 'talented', 'enthusiastic', 'hope', 'more', 'voices', 'future.The', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'film', 'also', 'Bolt', 'Be-Awesome', 'Mission', 'game', 'using', 'remote', 'Art', 'gallery', 'as', 'well', 'copy', 'movie', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'movie']",Bolt

It's a buddy road trip, with adventure and humor. It's Lassie, showing the strong bond between a kid and her dog.

I would expect this movie to have universal appeal, with its cute and lovable characters. It looks and sounds pristine on Blu-ray.

Raphael ""AstraDaemon of The Zombiep...","[1, 1]","I originally opted not to see this in the theater because I didn't think it could come close to the new standard set byWall-E, and the trailers didn't do the movie justice.I finally rented it for my son, and now we plan on purchasing it. The story is about a dog, Bolt, who is raised on-set, so he thinks the TV show being filmed is real. Everyone that has anything to do with the TV series goes out of their way to make sure that Bolt never finds out the truth. They want his reactions to be genuine.The problem arises when they take it too far, and Bolt is convinced that ""his person"" Penny has been kidnapped. He ends up lost off-set, but meets other animals that help him get back to Hollywood.The pigeons were awesome. They had different dialects, depending on where they lived, but these animatede versions had all the nautral clicks that real pigeons do (ex: the weird way they shift their eyes).The pigeons lead Bolt to a stray cat, Mittens, who he believes is in league with the bad guy. Bolt also meets, Rhino, a hamster who watches too much TV and thinks Bolt's character is real. Mittens tries to explain reality to Bolt and Rhino, but to no avail.The three of them travel together to Hollywood, with Mittens teaching Bolt how to be a regular pet, and Bolt discovering that Mittens used to be a pet herself.  By the time they arrive at the studio, the dynamic of the group has changed. Eventually, Bolt is reunited with Penny, but they are soon trapped by a very real studio fire.Of course, there is a happy ending. There is also a cute short with Rhino, who pays homage to Hannah Montana, which is amusing since Miley Cyrus is Penny's voice.While this is not as good as Wall E, I thought it had more action than Pixar's Up.

The running joke, ""Bolt, the super-dog,"" gives plenty of room for humor. The characters, especially Rhino the rodent with delusions of grandeur, work well. Animation, of course, meets very high standards. Somehow, though, Bolt adds up to a lot more than the sum of its parts.To tell the truth, lots of those parts show wear: the good-buddy road trip, the loyal dog, and a stifling set of moral messages about being true to your friends. This could have turned into a snoozable sermon.

When he's separated from Penny during a crucial scene where Penny is 'kidnapped' by the baddies, he is resolved to rescue her. Unfortunately, out in the real world, Bolt discovers to his dismay that he has 'lost' his superpowers, which he attributes to the styrofoam peanuts he was smothered in before being accidentally shipped off in a box to NYC. It is only after meeting a street smart kitty, Mittens [Susie Essman] that Bolt slowly comes to accept the realities of being a dog. Bolt uses his strength and cunning to force Mittens to show him the way to Penny [he is convinced that Mittens, being a cat, is in league with the baddies]. Along the way, the pair meet TV-addicted Rhino [Mark Walton], a pet hamster who immediately recognizes his 'hero' and finally the realization sinks into Bolt's consciousness that he is in fact, just an ordinary dog.The trio go through many adventures on their journey back to LA [Bolt is adamant in getting back to Penny], and in the course of the film, Bolt as well as Mittens and Rhino discover the true value of friendship, of being true to one's self, perseverance and loyalty.Most Disney productions do not fail to entertain whilst delivering inspiring messages, and Bolt succeeds on both counts.
