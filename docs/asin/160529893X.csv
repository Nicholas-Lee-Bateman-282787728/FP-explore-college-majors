193412,A26MVLLMLG3Q8B,160529893X,"Avid Reader ""Karen""","[71, 72]","This is an enjoyable walking workout that combines standing core work. The low impact walking choreography is simple to follow and the instructor does a great job of explaining each move in advance. Even though this is a walking workout, there are enough different moves to keep you from getting bored. This DVD is for everyone - there isn't anything jarring or high impact that could hurt any injuries.Workouts: There is a warmup, 25 minute walking routine with ""Stop and Tone"" segments that target the core, an 8 minute ab/core floor routine and a cool down.Setting: The set is a large, open workout studio with hard wood floors.Music: Instrumental background music. If exciting music is your thing, this is not it; however you can do this DVD many times and not get tired of the music.Crew: There are 2 women working out with Ellen. One person shows easier modifications and one shows more challenging modifications.Equipment Needed: No equipment needed for the walking workout - just a little space in front of your TV. I use a yoga mat when doing the floor work, but it really depends on the surface of your workout space.Instructor: Ellen Barrett is pleasant and encouraging. Her cueing is excellent.",4,Good walking workout,1278115200,"07 3, 2010",2010,1206,"['enjoyable', 'walking', 'workout', 'standing', 'core', 'work', 'low', 'impact', 'walking', 'choreography', 'simple', 'follow', 'instructor', 'great', 'job', 'explaining', 'move', 'advance', 'Even', 'walking', 'workout', 'are', 'enough', 'different', 'moves', 'keep', 'getting', 'bored', 'DVD', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'anything', 'jarring', 'high', 'impact', 'could', 'hurt', 'injuries.Workouts', 'warmup', '25', 'minute', 'walking', 'routine', 'Stop', 'Tone', 'segments', 'target', 'core', '8', 'minute', 'ab/core', 'floor', 'routine', 'cool', 'down.Setting', 'set', 'large', 'open', 'workout', 'studio', 'hard', 'wood', 'floors.Music', 'Instrumental', 'background', 'music', 'exciting', 'music', 'thing', 'not', 'however', 'can', 'do', 'DVD', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'get', 'tired', 'music.Crew', 'are', '2', 'women', 'working', 'out', 'Ellen', 'One', 'person', 'easier', 'modifications', 'one', 'more', 'challenging', 'modifications.Equipment', 'Needed', 'equipment', 'needed', 'walking', 'workout', 'just', 'little', 'space', 'front', 'TV', 'use', 'yoga', 'mat', 'when', 'doing', 'floor', 'work', 'really', 'surface', 'workout', 'space.Instructor', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'pleasant', 'encouraging', 'cueing', 'excellent']",Flat Belly Workout: Walk Off Your Belly
193413,A3NJZCBIOTA3BZ,160529893X,"Brandie Parker ""HEARTFANNN""","[19, 21]","This is an okay workout and a nice change of pace. This instructor is not quite as stiff as Freytag, but still a bit too bouncy with her unnatural walking moves. The bonus workout at the end is worth the purchase on it's own. You should be able to complete the 8 minute toning on your first try and really feel the results. The walk workout crosses the line and has just a few too many fancy dance steps, but if you can get through that five minutes, it's worth the effort. This is the first Prevention workout that I have purchased that is actually worth keeping in my collection.",3,Change of Pace,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,581,"['okay', 'workout', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'instructor', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'stiff', 'Freytag', 'still', 'bit', 'too', 'bouncy', 'unnatural', 'walking', 'moves', 'bonus', 'workout', 'end', 'purchase', 'own', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'complete', '8', 'minute', 'toning', 'first', 'try', 'really', 'feel', 'results', 'walk', 'workout', 'line', 'just', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'fancy', 'dance', 'steps', 'can', 'get', 'five', 'minutes', 'effort', 'first', 'Prevention', 'have', 'purchased', 'actually', 'worth', 'keeping', 'collection']",Flat Belly Workout: Walk Off Your Belly

193415,A83CZYODDQQOT,160529893X,Chickenmonkey,"[3, 4]","I've been doing the flat belly diet for some time and I was excited to find that they had workouts to accompany the eating plan, so I got this one and the other one (Express Belly Blast)to try out. This one (Walk off Belly Fat) consists of 25 minutes of intervals- you do a walking series and then you ""stop and tone"" in between the sets of walking. At the end you do about 8 minutes of ab work and then there is a cool down at the end. I think this video is pretty effective, it didn't get my heart pumping as much as the other one though and I have 2 left feet, so I found the walking footwork a challenge at first, but now that I've done it several times I have it down. I would say this workout is good for beginners through intermediate exercisers. Advanced exercisers would be bored with this workout. I really enjoy the instructor, Ellen Barrett, she cues really well and is energetic and motivating without being irritating. I also enjoy that there are modifications to most of the exercises that are demonstrated by one of the background girls in the video. Overall I think this is a good workout, it just isn't as good as the other one in this series, so that's why I only give it 4 stars.",4,"Good workout, but wish it was a little more interesting",1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1199,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'flat', 'belly', 'diet', 'time', 'was', 'excited', 'find', 'had', 'workouts', 'accompany', 'eating', 'plan', 'got', 'one', 'other', 'one', 'Express', 'Belly', 'Blast', 'try', 'out', 'one', 'Walk', 'Belly', 'Fat', '25', 'minutes', 'intervals-', 'do', 'walking', 'series', 'then', 'stop', 'tone', 'sets', 'walking', 'end', 'do', '8', 'minutes', 'ab', 'work', 'then', 'cool', 'down', 'end', 'think', 'video', 'pretty', 'effective', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'heart', 'pumping', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'one', 'have', '2', 'left', 'feet', 'found', 'walking', 'footwork', 'challenge', 'first', 'now', ""'ve"", 'done', 'several', 'times', 'have', 'down', 'would', 'say', 'workout', 'good', 'beginners', 'intermediate', 'exercisers', 'Advanced', 'exercisers', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'workout', 'really', 'enjoy', 'instructor', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'really', 'well', 'energetic', 'motivating', 'being', 'irritating', 'also', 'enjoy', 'are', 'modifications', 'most', 'exercises', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'one', 'background', 'girls', 'video', 'Overall', 'think', 'good', 'workout', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'other', 'one', 'series', 'why', 'only', 'give', '4', 'stars']",Flat Belly Workout: Walk Off Your Belly
