Being a progressive rock fan, a professional musician and drummer,I really liked the music, the lyrics, the playing skills of the band members and the song writing. These guys can really play.Itwas very nice to see that, Opeth are able to play their demanding songs live as good as the album versions. So to me,as a band, Opeth definetely deserves 5 stars. The DVD has very good sound and picture quality as well and successful in terms of production.But there is only one thing that bothers me about their live performance: The very long breaks between the songs. These breaks can go up to 2-3 minutes, and this makes Opeth unable to sustain the tension and the energy they created during the songs.",5,Keep up the good work.,1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,821,"['am', 'not', 'Opeth', 'fan', 'had', 'only', 'listened', 'two', 'albums', 'Deliverence', 'Damnation', 'buying', 'DVD', 'Being', 'progressive', 'rock', 'fan', 'professional', 'musician', 'drummer', 'really', 'liked', 'music', 'lyrics', 'playing', 'skills', 'band', 'members', 'song', 'writing', 'guys', 'can', 'really', 'play.Itwas', 'very', 'nice', 'see', 'Opeth', 'are', 'able', 'play', 'demanding', 'songs', 'live', 'as', 'good', 'album', 'versions', 'So', 'band', 'Opeth', 'definetely', '5', 'stars', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'successful', 'terms', 'production.But', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'live', 'performance', 'very', 'long', 'breaks', 'songs', 'breaks', 'can', 'go', 'up', '2-3', 'minutes', 'Opeth', 'unable', 'sustain', 'tension', 'energy', 'created', 'songs']",N/A

791441,A110L6QITPVJTP,B000127ZEG,B.Huss,"[4, 5]","The reason I bought this DVD was mainly because of the 'Damnation' set. I am not a Death Metal fan at all and prefer power or progressive when it comes to metal, bands like Overkill or Dream Theater respectively. Nevertheless I love the style of death metal of Opeth, particularly because of its complex progressive structures and the technical explosions of the heavier sections. Admittedly I'm not too keen on the grunting death vocals and I definitely prefer Mikael's melodic singing but in the context of their compositions I don't mind it that much at all. Overall I enjoy the entire set, starting with the fantastic quieter first part, and then the powerful second part, where the guys 'let loose'.When I say that it could have been better, I mean the extremely long breaks between songs which in my opinion break the flow of the concert (just watch Overkill's 'wrecking everything' DVD and you know what I mean).Also: no encore(?!). Was there a particular reason why they couldn't play at least one or even two more songs. If it was because of any sort of time restriction, then it would make even more sense to keep the breaks between songs short. Surely it's not absolutely neccessary to tune the guitars for every song. No other band I know does it.It's a shame. This could have been a barnburner of a DVD instead of merely being very good.PS: the making of... is ok.

The first part of the show is a complete rendition of the Damnation album.  From start to finish, in order.  That was awesome.  Then after that they played some songs off of Delieverance and Blackwater Park.  The concert was a little over two hours and was freaking awesome!  And if that's not enough fo you for some strange reason, there is an interesting documentary on the making of Deliverance and Damnation.If there was one dissapointing factor to this, it would be that there was nothing played before Blackwater Park.  But it's no biggie, If I want to hear something from Still Life, let's say, I'll pop in that album.

791443,AVCRD98TH48RN,B000127ZEG,D. Knouse,"[2, 2]","4.5 stars.  This is a great show!  I just wanted to get that out before any criticism dampens my spirit.  The show is divided into 2 sets, the first containing 9 songs, 8 of which are from their most recent album, Damnation.  The concert begins fine, with the first 3 songs played professionally and admirably.  But when Opeth unveils their extended version of the song &quot;Closure&quot; I was positive that these guys comprise one of the greatest bands in the world.  Of the remaining 5 songs there are shining moments strewn throughout, the final song of the first set giving a false sense of what is to come next: Progressive Death Metal.  The second set begins magnificently with &quot;Master's Apprentices&quot; from the album Deliverance, and the momentum is sustained with &quot;The Drapery Falls&quot; which follows.  But the cresecendo comes with the next 2 tracks.  Combined, watching &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;The Leper Affinity&quot; played live is both mesmerizing and awesome.  Their technical musicianship is incredible to behold!  There being no clear way for them to top that climax, they mellow a bit for the closing song, &quot;A Fair Judgement.&quot;  All in all, this was a superb concert, and had me buzzing for hours afterward.  But the actual DVD has its tedious moments.  The long pauses between some of the songs were slightly annoying.  Apparently, somebody forgot to tighten the editing to help make the show flow more smoothly.  While most of the editing was excellent, there were moments of confusion with out-of-focus cameras and confusing fast-cuts.  Some of the cuts were so fast I had a hard time figuring out which band member was being shown.  Sometimes the edit would contain only the instrument.  Now for the Documentary.  It is a solid, behind-the-scenes look at this superlative band creating in the studio, and interviews with each band member.  With the individual interviews you get a real sense that all these guys (let's not forget Steve Wilson) really care deeply about what they are creating.  It is truly refreshing to here such authentic honesty and enthusiasm.  Overall, this DVD is a requirement for all Opeth fans.

I was looking for something new and had heard of Opeth.  When I researched them/their music, more often than not I'd find the quote, ""Opeth rules!!!.""  I was open minded and excited to see what they were about.  BUT, after I watched this DVD, the only thing I could say was, Opeth - what a SNOREFEST-PALOOZA.  The video itself is shot very well BUT the band is a complete visual bore.  There are a lot of long pregnant pauses in between songs, almost as if they're just trying to kill time.  They look like they forgot they were playing in front of an audience and decided to throw in a band rehearsal before their moms pick them up for their weekend visitations with their bloated absentee fathers.  On top of that, they play their entire Dmnation album to the obvious chagrin of the audience.  The singer announces, apologetically, that they're going to continue playing the rest of the album, to which the crowd has no reaction, I mean NO REACTION FROM THE CROWD (if I was a performer, I'd take that to mean they ""no like it."") At times, the crowd is so disinterested that their conversations threaten to drown out the music.  The audience, in no way, appeared to be getting into this.  11/13ths of the way through the concert Opeth decide to play something heavy.  But not before the dullard singer tells the audience, pleadingly but in a muted tone, ""O.K. Now I want you to go absolutely (expletive) crazy.  O.K? "" then spends 55 seconds lolling around, as if he's waiting for inspiration (or a bus) before they play it. There is NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENING ON STAGE.  Absolutely no showmanship whatsoever.

Live Opeth is a powerful, indelible experience and the DVD captures that as well as is possible with the medium. The song selection is great (all of _Damnation_, killer tracks from _Deliverance_ and _Blackwater Park_). They couldn't include anything from earlier albums because other labels own those songs (copyright laws are unethical and should be abolished), but what is here is outstanding.The footage is some of the best I've seen on a metal DVD, with very little of the unnecessary and annoying hyperspeed editing that usually ruins these things. ""Lamentations"" has lots of varied camera angles, crystal-clear picture, and tight editing (but alas, limited camera angles of drummer Martin Lopez). The sound is great and the performances will send shivers through your body to your innermost core.

With six cameramen you'd think that the film editor/director could have chosen the best possible angle and used that. But no. Often its merely a snippet of a blistering guitar solo as the point of view changes every three seconds.  And while one can appreciate the attempt to capture the full sonic affect of an Opeth song by fast cutting to various band members, at times the affect is to wonder why you are hearing a guitar lead but not seeing it.So Opeth gets a 6 (out of 5) for music, the director gets a 4 (out of 6) for visuals.

For anyone who is familiar with their music, the first half is pretty mellow since it includes the performance of Damnation in its entirety.  By most accounts that particular album is an anomaly in that it doesn't include anything even remotely like death metal (that's not really a good way to categorize them anyway, they're too progressive and unique to be labeled anything but Opeth).  For longtime fans of what Opeth are known for (extended bone crunching assaults), the second half more than makes up for it.

I enjoyed the full mellow set of ""Damnation,"" However, the heavier set is what I truly was anticipating. My only criticism is the consistent slient breaks with the small talks between the songs...I understand the acknowledgement of any band towards its fans is always a good thing, but sometimes those minutes could be used for another possible song. Still, this does not take away from the great musical performance Opeth executes, plus furthermore, this is my opinion and only my opinion.

Now, I'm sure all Opeth fans ran out to get this as they should've, but if you do buy this don't expect a HUGELY  and facinating look into the members of Opeth, or even much into the music of Opeth, because all you'll basically get is a well performed concert and 1 hour making of documentary on their 2 latest albums.First let's start off with the concert. They do a handful of songs from the last few albums (Deliverance, Damnation, and Blackwater Park), but if you've seen them live already then you've pretty much already seen the DVD, they perform the songs the same, don't jump around stage or do anything out of the ordinary. I've seen them live twice so the live DVD wasn't anything special. The camera work and different angles were very good though and kept things interesting. Opeth was only able to do these songs from their 3 latests albums because of record company rights, so if you ask me, they should've probably waited for more albums until doing something like this for a better variety of songs, and a better in depth documentary.If you're going to buy this, buy it for the documentary. It'll take you into the studio and have interviews with each of the members of Opeth but simply does not dig deep enough into them as people. Sometimes you can't even understand what the hell the guys are saying because of the substandard recording and heavy accents. Sure, they mention things from their past and you learn a few things, but nothing extraodinary. Cannibal Corpse's latest DVD on &quot;15 year killing spree,&quot; you got to see the band hang out  outside of the concert and recording sessions, so it's almost like you got to know them one on one, i wish something similar could've been done with Opeth's DVD. You will see some cool stuff  though; like sessions with Steve Wilson, seeing Mikael Akerfeldt death growl in the recording booth, guitarists whaling on their guitars, and seeing Akerfeldt stress out and almost start crying during the recording sessions (they really went through hell to record the last 2 albums, i felt bad for em'), which is sad because idiot billion dollar bands like Metallica can have as much session time as they want, but when it comes to REAL metal talent like Opeth, the money and quality equipment just wasn't there.In conclusion, if you're an Opeth fan, you probably already have this and are agreeing on everything I'm saying, but if you're just getting into them, wait to be a hardcore fan before picking this one up. It's good for what it costs you, 12 bucks, but you realy only get what you pay for.",3,(3.5 stars) First Non-Necessary Opeth Release,1085788800,"05 29, 2004",2004,2659,"['Opeth', 'first', 'DVD', 'cheap', 'price', 'really', ""n't"", 'worth', 'owning', 'most', 'part', 'sadly', 'Now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Opeth', 'fans', 'ran', 'out', 'get', 'should', ""'ve"", 'do', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'HUGELY', 'facinating', 'look', 'members', 'Opeth', 'even', 'much', 'music', 'Opeth', ""'ll"", 'basically', 'get', 'well', 'performed', 'concert', '1', 'hour', 'making', 'documentary', '2', 'latest', 'albums.First', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'concert', 'do', 'handful', 'songs', 'last', 'few', 'albums', 'Deliverance', 'Damnation', 'Blackwater', 'Park', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'live', 'already', 'then', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'already', 'seen', 'DVD', 'perform', 'songs', 'same', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'around', 'stage', 'do', 'anything', 'ordinary', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'live', 'twice', 'so', 'live', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'camera', 'work', 'different', 'angles', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'though', 'kept', 'things', 'interesting', 'Opeth', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'do', 'songs', '3', 'latests', 'albums', 'record', 'company', 'rights', 'so', 'ask', 'should', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'waited', 'more', 'albums', 'doing', 'something', 'better', 'variety', 'songs', 'better', 'depth', 'documentary.If', ""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'buy', 'documentary', ""'ll"", 'take', 'studio', 'have', 'interviews', 'members', 'Opeth', 'simply', 'not', 'dig', 'deep', 'enough', 'people', 'Sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'understand', 'what', 'hell', 'guys', 'are', 'saying', 'substandard', 'recording', 'heavy', 'accents', 'Sure', 'mention', 'things', 'past', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'nothing', 'extraodinary', 'Cannibal', 'Corpse', 'latest', 'DVD', 'quot', '15', 'year', 'killing', 'spree', 'quot', 'got', 'see', 'band', 'hang', 'out', 'concert', 'recording', 'sessions', 'almost', 'got', 'know', 'one', 'one', 'wish', 'something', 'similar', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'Opeth', 'DVD', 'will', 'see', 'cool', 'stuff', 'sessions', 'Steve', 'Wilson', 'seeing', 'Mikael', 'Akerfeldt', 'death', 'growl', 'recording', 'booth', 'guitarists', 'whaling', 'guitars', 'seeing', 'Akerfeldt', 'stress', 'almost', 'start', 'crying', 'recording', 'sessions', 'really', 'went', 'hell', 'record', 'last', '2', 'albums', 'i', 'felt', 'bad', 'em', 'sad', 'idiot', 'billion', 'dollar', 'bands', 'Metallica', 'can', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'session', 'time', 'want', 'when', 'REAL', 'metal', 'talent', 'Opeth', 'money', 'quality', 'equipment', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'there.In', 'conclusion', ""'re"", 'Opeth', 'fan', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'are', 'agreeing', 'everything', ""'m"", 'saying', ""'re"", 'just', 'getting', 'wait', 'be', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'picking', 'one', 'up', 'good', 'what', '12', 'bucks', 'realy', 'only', 'get', 'what', 'pay']",N/A
791456,A1793S04PGEUZ9,B000127ZEG,Sunshine the Werewolf,"[47, 50]","OPETH - Lamenations (DVD)-Since the purchase of this DVD I do not believe I have gone a week without watching at least part of the Concert.  From start to finish this DVD showcase one of World's greatest bands proving why they are one of the greatest bands.There are two sets:  The 1st set opens with Windowpane and continues though all of the Damnation Album (Actually they throw in Harvest off BWP before the closer Weakness.)  Set One may be subtle in its delivery, yet it beautiful and incredibly atmospheric. The exception is the ending of Closure, Which I believe has the only real distortion off of Damnation.  This ending erupts which is only a preview of what is to come during their second set.The Second Set (The Heavier Part) is composed of songs off Deliverance and Blackwater Park. From what I've heard, they had some label issues and couldn't record anything Pre-BWP for this DVD.  SET II, kicks off with Master's Apprentices... which is was the perfect way to begin thing on a heavier note and then they continue with: The Drapery Falls, Deliverance, and The Leper Affinity.  For a closer Opeth plays the beautiful:  A Fair Judgment, which is my personal favorite, slower Opeth song.In addition to this 2 hour concert there is an hour plus Documentary with Steven Wilson. (Incase you don't know he was their Producer for BWP, Deliverance and Damnation.  - He is also the front man of the UK band called Porcupine Tree.) This Documentary is a great way to get inside the making of the last 2 albums as well as to get to know the Band and Mr. Wilson.Some highlights are, the scene where Martin Lopez is recording the end of Deliverance... very cool.  There is also a scene where Mikeal is doing some death-growls with a goofy look on his face.  He keeps giving a look to Steve Wilson as if he's questioning his approval on his previous scream.  (Actually it is quite humorous to hear a vicious death growl and then see the looks he gives Wilson)All in all, this DVD is required for anyone who either loves Opeth or those may have even a remote interest in the band.  In fact everyone who has a remote interest in music should check this out.  Even the first part of the Concert (SET I) would easily be acceptable by my Fathers 70's Rock Roots.Favorite Tracks:  Closure, Master's Apprentice, The Leper Affinity and A Fair Judgment.-5.0 StarsP.S. To those who said this DVD was boring because there wasn't enough stage antics... go buy the Killswitch Engage DVD.  Personally I'd rather watch a talented band compose a work of art.  Then a band that will do overdubs to correct the mistakes they make while playing live and dancing around like fools.  Nothing Personal KsE but antics may impress the 15 year olds but Opeth are the Masters of a live performance and this DVD clearly demonstrates that.IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?""",5,My Favorite Music DVD - EVER!!!!,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,2900,"['OPETH', 'Lamenations', 'DVD', '-Since', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'have', 'gone', 'week', 'watching', 'least', 'part', 'Concert', 'start', 'finish', 'DVD', 'showcase', 'one', 'World', 'greatest', 'bands', 'proving', 'why', 'are', 'one', 'greatest', 'are', 'two', 'sets', '1st', 'set', 'opens', 'Windowpane', 'Damnation', 'Album', 'Actually', 'throw', 'Harvest', 'BWP', 'closer', 'Weakness', 'Set', 'One', 'may', 'be', 'subtle', 'delivery', 'beautiful', 'incredibly', 'atmospheric', 'exception', 'ending', 'Closure', 'Which', 'believe', 'only', 'real', 'distortion', 'Damnation', 'ending', 'erupts', 'only', 'preview', 'what', 'come', 'second', 'set.The', 'Second', 'Set', 'Heavier', 'Part', 'composed', 'songs', 'Deliverance', 'Blackwater', 'Park', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'had', 'label', 'issues', 'could', ""n't"", 'record', 'anything', 'Pre-BWP', 'DVD', 'SET', 'II', 'off', 'Master', 'Apprentices', 'was', 'perfect', 'way', 'begin', 'thing', 'heavier', 'note', 'then', 'continue', 'Drapery', 'Falls', 'Deliverance', 'Leper', 'Affinity', 'closer', 'Opeth', 'beautiful', 'Fair', 'Judgment', 'personal', 'favorite', 'slower', 'Opeth', 'song.In', 'addition', '2', 'hour', 'concert', 'hour', 'Documentary', 'Steven', 'Wilson', 'Incase', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Producer', 'BWP', 'Deliverance', 'Damnation', 'also', 'front', 'man', 'UK', 'band', 'called', 'Porcupine', 'Tree', 'Documentary', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'making', 'last', '2', 'albums', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'know', 'Band', 'Mr.', 'Wilson.Some', 'highlights', 'are', 'scene', 'where', 'Martin', 'Lopez', 'recording', 'end', 'Deliverance', 'very', 'cool', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'Mikeal', 'doing', 'death-growls', 'goofy', 'look', 'face', 'giving', 'look', 'Steve', 'Wilson', 'questioning', 'approval', 'previous', 'scream', 'quite', 'humorous', 'hear', 'vicious', 'death', 'growl', 'then', 'see', 'looks', 'Wilson', 'All', 'DVD', 'required', 'anyone', 'who', 'Opeth', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'remote', 'interest', 'band', 'fact', 'everyone', 'who', 'remote', 'interest', 'music', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Even', 'first', 'part', 'Concert', 'SET', 'would', 'easily', 'be', 'acceptable', 'Fathers', '70', 'Rock', 'Roots.Favorite', 'Tracks', 'Closure', 'Master', 'Apprentice', 'Leper', 'Affinity', 'A', 'Fair', 'Judgment.-5.0', 'StarsP.S', 'who', 'said', 'DVD', 'was', 'boring', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'stage', 'antics', 'go', 'buy', 'Killswitch', 'Engage', 'DVD', 'Personally', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'talented', 'band', 'compose', 'work', 'art', 'Then', 'band', 'will', 'do', 'overdubs', 'correct', 'mistakes', 'make', 'playing', 'live', 'dancing', 'fools', 'Nothing', 'Personal', 'KsE', 'antics', 'may', 'impress', '15', 'year', 'olds', 'Opeth', 'are', 'Masters', 'live', 'performance', 'DVD', 'clearly', 'YOU', 'LIKED', 'AGREED', 'OR', 'APPRECIATED', 'THIS', 'PLEASE', 'CLICK', 'YES', 'FOR', 'Was', 'review', 'helpful']",N/A

Now, being a raving Opeth fanboy, my reaction to this release may be more intense than the average Joe, but the crazy Swedes have done it again. Just to see Opeth live, which is something I will never have a chance to do in the flesh, was an amazing experience.Forget that the entire Damnation album is performed, forget that The Leper Affinity and Deliverance alone are so thrashingly powerful that you run the risk of losing part of your short term memory, just buy it.Technical merits abound, the DVD has 5.1 and DTS surround, all the more needed if you wish to actually hear Martin Lopez' kick bass rumbling while you are in the shower. Mikeal Akerfeldt and crew remain the reigning masters of death metal, and this release only reaffirms it. This is a must have for fans of amazing music. ""Windowpane,"" ""Hope Leaves,"" and ""Deliverance"" are worth the price alone.Then, after the rapturous musical set ends, you get the pleasure of watching an hour long documentary on the making of Deliverance/Damnation.
