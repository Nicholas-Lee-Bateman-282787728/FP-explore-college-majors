1105186,A33L7G4E8CID3,B000VXK6Z0,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[2, 2]","It is hard to argue that Curb Your Enthusiasm has maintained a consistent level of quality throughout its entire run--the previous two seasons were predominantly weak, despite some exceptions. At times in recent history, the series seemed to be moving toward becoming an inside-baseball series about showbusiness instead of the saga of the world's greatest self-sabotager, Larry David. In fact, after the deeply unsatisfying (and very unfunny) finale for the series' fifth season, many fans might have been correct in just wanting to let the axe drop on the series for good, so as to (ironically) save further embarrassment for Larry. But this show going out on such a low note would have been a bit too disappointing, I suppose. So, considering the diminishing returns that recent seasons of the show have shown, some skeptics might have expected this season of Curb to be as uninspired as some recent seasons.Thankfully, these people were WRONG, as this season of Curb is easily the best to date. I count only two dud episodes in this set, and even those have some redeeming moments. And the good episodes are every bit as good as anything else the show has done. All episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm are incredibly contrived operettas of humiliation. At its best, though, Curb is able to proceed through the absurdity at such a frantic pace that one is willing to accept the ridiculousness. The past two seasons have sacrificed that energy, in my opinion, in order to be more about ""showbiz"" culture, a well-worn subject area that was more or less definitively charted in The Larry Sanders Show and, to a lesser extent, Entourage. I believe that that last phrase should become part of Entourage's branding. Isn't Entourage like the lesser extent, period? It's rather slight.In this season, though, Curb gets back to its roots in many ways. There is, of course, the season's main plot of Larry and Cheryl adopting the Black family, displaced by a hurricane and brought in by yet another of Cheryl's self-righteous acts of charity. Some people might say that the depictions of the Black family are racist or one-sided or in some other way bigoted, but in my opinion, those people are WRONG! They are presented as being easygoing, uncomplicated people who are generally kind and mean what they say--in other words, a stark contrast with the assorted Hollywood a-holes with which Larry has to rub elbows every day. In fact, this season of CYE has a generally naturalistic take on race relations. And the show had never before seen a character like Leon, who becomes Larry's best friend over the course of the series. The actor playing him is such a force of nature that I will be upset if he doesn't pop up again in the show's next season. Many of Leon's memorable quotations are decidedly profane, but there's never been a character quite like him on television--a Black man who is a bit of a hustler and a smooth talker but is totally devoted to his family and completely without any hint of any chip on his shoulder. His chemistry with Larry is superb (see in particular Larry's advice to him on how to flip around a job interview so that he's the one asking the questions, or Leon's advice to Larry on how to stand up to people, which involves a pretty hilarious extended metaphor).The other main storyline in this season is the (supposedly uninspired by real events) separation of Larry and Cheryl. The show actually presents a good case for why Cheryl wasn't really that good for Larry--aside from the self-righteousness, she never really seemed to want to stand up for him, or try to make him a better person. Larry winds up finding someone else--I won't say who--but the final scene of the season is one of the most appropriate and satisfying imaginable. I know that a lot of fans of the show liked the early ""Trick or Treat"" episode because Larry actually kinda came out ahead on that episode and managed to take revenge on one of the many adversaries that annoyed him. Well, let's just say that the final scene of the finale is in the same vein and will put a smile on your face, only it feels even better than the earlier episode.One of the truly unexpected things in this season is not only how fresh the comedy seems--and we see Larry in all manner of compromising situations, from stealing flowers from Funkhouser's mother's memorial (which leads to an angry confrontation in which Funkhouser declares, ""If we weren't best friends, I'd rip your face off,"" to which Larry repies nonchalantly, after Funkhouser leaves, ""He's not my best friend."") to a predictably awesome screaming match between Larry and John McEnroe (over a freaks book) to a drunk limo driver ruining Ted Danson's birthday party by shouting, ""Happy birthday, Becker!"" and so on--but also how well the show tackles the difficult subject matter of separation and divorce. The show never strikes a false moment in a season that has to qualify as the most heartfelt of all seasons of Curb, and while one might predict that adding some emotion to the old cynical formula would only serve to weaken the show, it actually strengthens it greatly. There's more at stake, and we see Larry start to grow up, if only a little bit, as he's nurtured by his new friends (and family), the Blacks. This might well be the seminal season of Curb, should it go forward, but if not it will be a very fitting end to the saga. It's certainly the funniest season of television in memory.I'll just say this--it's pretty, pretty, prett-y-y-y good!",5,The best season of Curb there ever has been or ever could

Larry is back with great topical comedy (none of the surreal oddity of season 5) and his usual neurotic faux-pas.

1105189,A10UGG54QNH71L,B000VXK6Z0,"Alex S ""Blurb""","[7, 9]","There's an underpinning sadness that runs through Curb's season 6.First, due to the desctuction of their home (an obvious allusion to New Orleans), the Black family (literally - that's their name, as well as skin color) moves in with the Davids, creating a unique relationship that's sometimes humorous, sometimes sad, and sometimes both.Second, people are now wary of David's unconventional conduct. They seem to avoid him, as if they can't be bothered to deal with him at all anymore.Third, Cheryl's finally had enough of Larry's antics and leaves him. The house becomes empty, a stark contrast to the constant yelling and bickering before. The loneliness gradually seeps through, accentuating the last factor which makes this season more than slightly despondent: Larry's getting old. Seeing him wandering around this huge empty house in his pajamas makes the viewer contemplate the inevitability of death - even seemingly ageless, eternally witty figures like Larry grow old and lonely.That's not to say this season isn't funny. In fact, it starts off on a hilarious note, and only gradually, and very subtly, does it become more thoughtful, more reflective. The producers have toned down on the eccentricity and slapstick that became quite apparent, almost overbearing in Curb lately, and returned to their traditional, reality-show roots. While not quite as real and hysterical as seasons 1-3, the sixth one is also much more so than seasons 4 and 5.The absence of Curb stalwart director Robert B. Weide is apparent - he only did one episode, ""The Anonymous Donor"", and it's by far the funniest one in the bunch. The producers must have brought in David Mandel to inject some lyricism into Curb, and the results are clear. While staying true to its low-key roots, and intermittently side-splitting (how can it not be, after all - it IS Larry David), season 6 certainly feels like a come-down, and if it's not the end of an era, then surely the premonition of one.PS: Steve Coogan does a weird-to-the-point-of-stupefying cameo that is both out-of-place in the Curb universe and completely uproarious at the same time.",4,"Haha, Sniff Sniff",1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,2122,"['underpinning', 'sadness', 'Curb', 'season', '6.First', 'due', 'desctuction', 'home', 'obvious', 'allusion', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Black', 'family', 'literally', 'name', 'as', 'well', 'skin', 'color', 'Davids', 'creating', 'unique', 'relationship', 'sometimes', 'humorous', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'sometimes', 'both.Second', 'people', 'are', 'now', 'wary', 'David', 'unconventional', 'conduct', 'seem', 'avoid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'deal', 'anymore.Third', 'Cheryl', 'finally', 'had', 'enough', 'Larry', 'antics', 'house', 'empty', 'stark', 'contrast', 'constant', 'yelling', 'bickering', 'before', 'loneliness', 'gradually', 'accentuating', 'last', 'factor', 'season', 'more', 'slightly', 'despondent', 'Larry', 'getting', 'old', 'Seeing', 'wandering', 'huge', 'empty', 'house', 'pajamas', 'viewer', 'contemplate', 'inevitability', 'death', 'even', 'seemingly', 'ageless', 'eternally', 'witty', 'figures', 'Larry', 'grow', 'old', 'lonely.That', 'not', 'say', 'season', ""n't"", 'funny', 'fact', 'hilarious', 'note', 'only', 'gradually', 'very', 'subtly', 'become', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'more', 'reflective', 'producers', 'have', 'toned', 'down', 'eccentricity', 'slapstick', 'became', 'quite', 'apparent', 'almost', 'overbearing', 'Curb', 'lately', 'returned', 'traditional', 'reality-show', 'roots', 'not', 'quite', 'real', 'hysterical', 'seasons', '1-3', 'sixth', 'one', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'seasons', '4', '5.The', 'absence', 'Curb', 'stalwart', 'director', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Weide', 'apparent', 'only', 'did', 'one', 'episode', 'Anonymous', 'Donor', 'far', 'funniest', 'one', 'bunch', 'producers', 'must', 'have', 'brought', 'David', 'Mandel', 'inject', 'lyricism', 'Curb', 'results', 'are', 'clear', 'staying', 'true', 'low-key', 'roots', 'intermittently', 'side-splitting', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'Larry', 'David', 'season', '6', 'certainly', 'feels', 'come-down', 'not', 'end', 'era', 'then', 'surely', 'premonition', 'one.PS', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'weird-to-the-point-of-stupefying', 'cameo', 'out-of-place', 'Curb', 'universe', 'completely', 'uproarious', 'same', 'time']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 6

One would think that by this time, the series would start to show wear and tear, but it doesn't.

The shows are as hilarious as anything Larry's done, with special kudos going to The Ida Funkhouser Roadside Memorial (where Larry steals flowers from his friend's mother's memorial), The Therapists (with a wonderful comic turn by Steve Coogan), The N Word (where Jeff Garlin accidentally gets his head shaved because of Larry, and Garlin actually got his head shaven for the show and sports a crewcut for the rest of the series), and the anonymous donor, where Larry gets in Ted Danson's face about being ""anonymous"".  It's also funny to see Larry use the Blacks' bathroom with their ""real"" toilet paper, as opposed to the scarring, environmentally friendly one.  Larry divorced his wife, Laurie, and he complained in an interview how she was pyscho about her environmentalism, and she forced him to use said toilet paper.  Larry's rear end is now much more pleasant, as he has divorced Laurie and enjoys the benefits of singledom and soft toilet paper.Many of the usual suspects appear here, and new ones do too (the above Black family, Michael McKean, Steve Coogan, Tia Carrere).

Seasons 4 and 5 were good, but they lacked the originality and freshness of their predecessors. Well, with Season 6, CYE is back on track!The introduction of new central characters so late in a series's life is typically evidence of ""jumping the shark."" But this is not the case with the introduction of an African-American family, the Blacks, whom Cheryl and Larry take in as hurricane refugees. Particularly, it is Leon (played by J.B. Smoove) who stands out. When he and Larry share screen time together, virtually every second is hilarious.The real-life Larry David went through a divorce prior to Season 6, and thus, CYE offers a new take on Cheryl, who is largely based on real-life Larry's environmentalist wife, Laurie. Thus far, CYE-Larry has been seen as inconsiderate and bumbling in marital relations, but Cheryl's actions in Season 6 give a new perspective on all of his previous foibles. Ultimately, the season ends with a finale that rivals that of Season 3 -- and Susie Green is, for once, put in her place!

This is definately one of the best seasons.  He almost always gets better over time.  And while it only has 10 episodes, they are all terrific.  The situations he gets himself in are hilarious.  I cringe each time he either puts his foot in it or someone takes him the wrong way.  I felt for him when he was relaying what he'd heard in the bathrooms at the hospital and when he was telling the story, someone assumed that he was actually the one who'd said it and the trouble that follows.Here is some detail on what happens throughout this season.MEET THE BLACKSCheryl learns about a program to help disenfranchised families displaced by a major hurricane, and tries to talk Larry into hosting a family. Meanwhile, Larry's quest to find the perfect excuse for missing parties backfires on him, and he's disgusted by the choice of cake Marty Funkhauser recommends.THE ANONYMOUS DONORLarry decides to be nice for a change and actually donate money to a worthy cause. But when he's revealed to be the anonymous donor for the hospital wing, Larry goes ballistic. He then accuses a dry cleaner of giving his jersey to someone else, and goes off in search of it. Meanwhile, Larry, Jeff, and the Blacks get their reputation stained.THE IDA FUNKHOUSER ROADSIDE MEMORIALA sweaty $50 bill, a sample abuser, a roadside memorial, and a private school superintendent are all things that intimidate Larry while he tries to help Marty Funkhauser cope with the sudden death of his mother in a freak accident.THE BATHROOM MONITORQuestions about Larry's bathroom habits become concern when Larry gets Richard Lewis' girlfriend a job at a place across the hall from his office. Meanwhile an incident involving a waiter and some take-out food threatens Jeff's dog.THE FREAK BOOKLarry's birthday gift to Ted Danson - a coffee table book called ""Mondo Freaks"" gets him in trouble with everyone he shows the book to, which includes Ted, the limo driver, tennis star John McEnroe, a group of random mourners, and Paul McCartney's ex-wife Heather Mills.THE RAT DOGA faulty toaster makes life difficult for Loretta and Leon. Larry repeatedly offends a hearing impaired girl about the small dog she keeps with her. Larry and Leon get their phones mixed up, and Larry traumatizes the entire audience at Sammy's middle school production of Grease when he invites Jeff's exterminator to watch the show.THE TIVO GUYCheryl is finally tired of Larry being Larry after her plane encounters severe turbulence and Larry seems more concerned about a malfunctioning TV device. After Cheryl announces that she's leaving Larry, the incident quickly splits up Larry's friends, who now have to break the news to Larry as to whose side they are taking.THE N WORDLarry goes to the hospital to see his new girlfriend, an orthopedist. While in the bathroom, Larry overhears one end of a very angry, horribly offensive cell phone conversation. But repeating what the man said offends another doctor - the same one who is about to perform Jeff's operation. But it only results in Jeff's head getting shaved, who now has to deal with being bald. Larry has to give testimony as Jeff prepares to sue the hospital.THE THERAPISTSLarry devises an overly elaborate plan to win back Cheryl. He does so by trying to get on her therapists' good side. Meanwhile, Larry accuses Marty Funkhauser of taking charity money under false pretenses.THE BAT MITZVAHThe Blacks learn some good news: they get to go home. As Larry says goodbye, he once again offends the wrong person, who takes his revenge on Larry by spreading a nasty rumor involving him and a gerbil. But thankfully Jeff's daughter's bat mitzvahs is coming up, and that provides Larry with the perfect, public opportunity to clear up that nasty rumor, as well as one more chance to patch things up with Cheryl.I cannot wait to own all of these on the dvd set.  I can add it to my other five seasons.  I enjoy watching these over again every now and then because you still laugh even though you've seen it before.

He continues to ""plumb the depths"" of sophisticated situational comedy. Further nooks and crannies of obscure, unwritten social law are explored in painstaking detail. This sixth season tops even the flawless fifth season.Of course, our antagonising protagonist is assisted in his questionable explorations by his unscrupulous agent and co-conspirator, Jeff Green (Jeff Garlin). In tireless opposition to the duo's antics stand Larry's wife Cheryl, Jeff's wife Susie, friends Marty Funkhouser, Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, and a vast array of quirky guest characters.Chief among the guest characters in this season are a family of survivors of Hurricane Katrina who, at Cheryl's charitable insistence, come to stay with the Davids at their LA mansion. While Larry is initially hesitant about the idea, he grows fond of his new housemates, especially Leon, the 30-something unemployed layabout, thug-for-hire, and self-confessed babe-magnet. Leon and Larry have chemistry to burn.I turn now to Larry's best friend and, when it comes to arguments, his most deadly nemesis, Richard Lewis. I should point out that Richard's screen time in this series is limited. Space and time have been compressed, however, because the few choice sequences in which Richard does appear are so funny that you'll cry your eyes out. No one drives Larry nuts like Richard. This man can send Larry into a flaming rage without batting an eyelid.Further highlights include:Larry's pathetic attempt to get out of a close friend's house party - a scheme which is imitated in turn by Jeff and then Richard;An admission by Jeff that he fornicated with himself in one of Larry's spare rooms during a dinner party;Several continued assaults on the peculiarities of doctors; andA scheme Larry cooks up with his loony psychiatrist (played by special guest star Steve Coogan) in a desperate attempt to reconcile with a loved-one.The last episode restores a newfound equilibrium to Larry's personal life, which by the end of the series is greatly transformed.

1105214,A387BD735MI50R,B000VXK6Z0,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","I was reluctant to get the Sixth Season of ""Curb"" because I'd heard the show takes the shocking turn of heading Larry and Cheryl into divorce. I couldn't imagine ""Curb"" being nearly as funny without the solid, sane backbone of their marriage, and specifically without Cheryl. Cheryl is the perfect foil for Larry.I was relieved and delighted to see that Cheryl is still a part of every episode. In fact, Larry's attempts to reconcile with her bring her even more into play than usual.These attempts introduce another character into the series that I hope we'll see more of - Larry's hapless therapist. After this well-meaning, but slightly bewildered man gives Larry some terrible advice about how to effect a reconciliation, he lends himself to one of Larry's wild schemes by way of making amends. He goes the last mile, and almost ends up walking the Green Mile, in his efforts to make-up for his error.My only criticism of the show at this stage is that it has ratcheted up the vulgar exchanges almost to the point of being over-the-top unbelievable. These Sixth Season episodes tend to march along in strict 2/2 time. Larry commits some terrible faux pas (or is perceived as having committed a terrible faux pas) - and an exchange of raw, raunchy obscenities ensues. It's gaff - wrath - gaff - wrathe - gaff... Every scene is a riff on that basic theme, in that same tempo. It would be impossible to sustain any friendships, any social relationships of any kind, if that was the tenor of all a person's daily encounters.This DVD includes a bonus interview chat between Larry David and series co-star Susie Essman. The two are much more civil to each other in this interview than they ever are in the series. This civility serves as an almost necessary corrective to the often minimally provoked barrage of cursing that marks the exchanges between them on the Show.You might want to take the time to watch this DVD bonus material for other reasons. Larry David gives an interesting account of how he goes about creating each episode. From the start, he wanted to distinguish ""Curb"" from his previous ""Seinfeld"" hit series by making this follow-up more improvisational. He and the other series' writers spend a lot of time outlining each scene. But they don't give the actors much, if any, specific dialogue. They don't even let them know the outlines of their scenes beforehand, so that the actors don't think up and rehearse funny lines. Larry David wants the show to be ad-lib as much as possible.Perhaps that's why it's been easy for the show to fall perhaps a little too much into a pattern of road-rage volleys. Since the actors aren't allowed to compose funny lines in advance, they fall back on ever more explosive fusillades of profanity to fill their time. They are each put in the position of the stand-up comic who hasn't prepared enough witty material and who then falls back on profanity to get sure shock laughs. Maybe just a little more prepared dialogue wouldn't be a bad thing.But this is a relatively minor flaw in an otherwise hilarious series that I generally can't get enough of.

1105216,A3B6X5KB0W963D,B000VXK6Z0,Troll Reviewer,"[0, 0]","Look on numerous Internet forums/polls and you'll find that season six of Larry David's brilliant series 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' is one of the most popular seasons, if not the most popular. While season six is another excellent season for the show, I actually disagree with that opinion, and found this season a little overrated. Now, I think that almost each season is only marginally better or worse than others, so when I call it the second-weakest one yet, I'm not saying much. But still, that's my opinion: that it's the weakest since season one, even if by a tiny margin.""Meet the Blacks"" begins season six with a pretty clean slate, and although not up to CYE standards, it's still cleverly written and includes the start of one of the best additions to the entire show yet: the Black family. Next up are two fan favorites: ""The Anonymous Donor"" and ""The Ida Funkhouser Roadside Memorial."" While I understand the love for the former (Larry's irritation with the anonymity of a wall donation is subtly hilarious), the latter is just too far-fetched for me to consider it a classic. Larry stealing roadside memorial flowers seems too insensitive for him, and nobody accepting the $50 bill when he tried to buy something was just unrealistic. It's quite funny, but not realistic enough to be a classic. ""The Lefty Call"" is a mostly mediocre episode that I would consider one of the series' weakest if not for two hilarious moments: the classic Leon monologue and the fight between Larry and Richard Lewis that culminates in Larry's rhetorical suggestion of a 'colon contest.'""The Freak Book"" is an underrated classic, with a higher laugh-per-minute ratio than most season six episodes. ""The Rat Dog"" is another very funny episode, although it's no masterpiece, mostly for the fact that it's a little too busy. It had about four plots/subplots in one, which is too many for most 30-minute sitcom episodes, including this one. Next up is ""The TiVo Guy,"" the famous episode where Cheryl leaves Larry from a combination of Larry's social ineptness, a malfunctioning TV, and a guy sitting next to Cheryl who makes no-fly zone underwear. ""The N Word"" is a merely solid episode with more generic humor than usual, but it's made much better by Larry's Cheryl montage and Leon's hilarious reaction when he hears loud snoring. ""The Therapists"" is an interesting one, with less laughs than usual, but a nice temporary reconciliation of Larry and Cheryl. And ""The Bat Mitzvah"" is a classic that's up there with the best CYE season finales, partly because of its amazing last five minutes.So, overall, this season of 'Curb' definitely wasn't the strongest one yet. I think it's the weakest since season one, although once again, that's not saying much at all because almost each season is better or worse than the others by a very small margin. Also, I think it deserves extra credit for being the season where the Blacks were introduced, as the addition of the Blacks was really good. The family (especially Leon and Loretta) actually felt like characters, and not just plot tools.Best episodes: ""The Anonymous Donor"" and ""The TiVo Guy""Season grade: A-",4,"Not the best season, although still another excellent one",1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,3143,"['Look', 'numerous', 'Internet', 'forums/polls', ""'ll"", 'find', 'season', 'six', 'Larry', 'David', 'brilliant', 'series', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'seasons', 'not', 'most', 'popular', 'season', 'six', 'excellent', 'season', 'show', 'actually', 'disagree', 'opinion', 'found', 'season', 'little', 'overrated', 'Now', 'think', 'almost', 'season', 'only', 'marginally', 'better', 'worse', 'others', 'when', 'call', 'second-weakest', 'one', 'yet', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'still', 'opinion', 'weakest', 'season', 'one', 'even', 'tiny', 'margin', 'Meet', 'Blacks', 'season', 'six', 'pretty', 'clean', 'slate', 'not', 'CYE', 'standards', 'still', 'cleverly', 'written', 'start', 'one', 'best', 'additions', 'entire', 'show', 'yet', 'Black', 'family', 'up', 'are', 'two', 'fan', 'favorites', 'Anonymous', 'Donor', 'Ida', 'Funkhouser', 'Roadside', 'Memorial', 'understand', 'love', 'former', 'Larry', 'irritation', 'anonymity', 'wall', 'donation', 'subtly', 'hilarious', 'latter', 'just', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'consider', 'classic', 'Larry', 'stealing', 'roadside', 'memorial', 'flowers', 'too', 'insensitive', 'nobody', 'accepting', '50', 'bill', 'when', 'tried', 'buy', 'something', 'was', 'just', 'unrealistic', 'quite', 'funny', 'not', 'realistic', 'enough', 'be', 'classic', 'Lefty', 'Call', 'mostly', 'mediocre', 'episode', 'would', 'consider', 'one', 'series', 'weakest', 'not', 'two', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'classic', 'Leon', 'monologue', 'fight', 'Larry', 'Richard', 'Lewis', 'Larry', 'rhetorical', 'suggestion', ""'colon"", 'contest', 'Freak', 'Book', 'underrated', 'classic', 'higher', 'laugh-per-minute', 'ratio', 'most', 'season', 'six', 'episodes', 'Rat', 'Dog', 'very', 'funny', 'episode', 'masterpiece', 'mostly', 'fact', 'little', 'too', 'busy', 'had', 'four', 'plots/subplots', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'most', '30-minute', 'sitcom', 'episodes', 'including', 'one', 'Next', 'up', 'TiVo', 'Guy', 'famous', 'episode', 'where', 'Cheryl', 'Larry', 'combination', 'Larry', 'social', 'ineptness', 'malfunctioning', 'TV', 'guy', 'sitting', 'next', 'Cheryl', 'who', 'no-fly', 'zone', 'underwear', 'N', 'Word', 'merely', 'solid', 'episode', 'more', 'generic', 'humor', 'usual', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'Larry', 'Cheryl', 'montage', 'Leon', 'hilarious', 'reaction', 'when', 'loud', 'snoring', 'Therapists', 'interesting', 'one', 'less', 'laughs', 'usual', 'nice', 'temporary', 'reconciliation', 'Larry', 'Cheryl', 'Bat', 'Mitzvah', 'classic', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'CYE', 'season', 'finales', 'partly', 'amazing', 'last', 'five', 'minutes.So', 'overall', 'season', ""'Curb"", 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'strongest', 'one', 'yet', 'think', 'weakest', 'season', 'one', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'almost', 'season', 'better', 'worse', 'others', 'very', 'small', 'margin', 'Also', 'think', 'extra', 'credit', 'being', 'season', 'where', 'Blacks', 'were', 'introduced', 'addition', 'Blacks', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'family', 'especially', 'Leon', 'Loretta', 'actually', 'felt', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'plot', 'tools.Best', 'episodes', 'Anonymous', 'Donor', 'TiVo', 'Guy', 'Season', 'grade', 'A-']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 6

1105218,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B000VXK6Z0,Wesley Mullins,"[64, 66]","The sixth season of critical darling Curb Your Enthusiasm delivers the same Larry David and his life of absurd self-sabotage that has entertained viewers for nearly a decade.  With an almost reality-TV improv feel, Curb follows the Seinfeld co-creator through his miseries and mishaps brought about by his George Costanza-like neuroses and over analysis of everyday situations.As with previous years, Season 6 is tied together by a single overarching plot.  In the first episode, Larry's wife convinces him to take in a family displaced by a recent hurricane.  The Black Family (whose name mirrors their race, a joke not lost on Larry) work their way into each episode, as either an extra source of frustration for our perpetually exasperated hero or as a source for an alternative perspective when providing Larry with advice.  In another example of art imitating life, a second extended plot develops involving the breakdown of Larry's marriage, just as he is going through divorce proceedings in real life. Cheryl's character doesn't seem as important in Season 6, also possibly the product of Larry's real life matrimonial problems.  His frustrations with Cheryl take a meaner, more mocking tone (her absurd reaction to Larry and the Blacks desire to use non-recycled toilet paper being the best example).  Larry's real life soon-to-be former wife is a champion of environmental and other causes, a trait she shares with Cheryl and one that Season Six paints as nave and misguided.Richard Lewis, Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen continue their real life roles as Larry's friends and have no problems mocking their own image (where else can you see great moments like an uninvited drunken limo driver crashing a party and taunting Ted Danson by calling him ""Becker""?).  Season 6 adds Lucy Lawless, Senator Barbara Boxer and John McEnroe in small parts as themselves, each bravely portraying an exaggerated and ridiculous version of who they really are, but one that fits perfectly with Larry David's view of the world...and one that echoes the spirit of this irresistible show.",5,Another Great Season,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,2079,"['sixth', 'season', 'critical', 'darling', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'same', 'Larry', 'David', 'life', 'absurd', 'self-sabotage', 'entertained', 'viewers', 'nearly', 'decade', 'almost', 'reality-TV', 'improv', 'feel', 'Curb', 'Seinfeld', 'co-creator', 'miseries', 'mishaps', 'brought', 'about', 'George', 'Costanza-like', 'neuroses', 'analysis', 'everyday', 'situations.As', 'previous', 'years', 'Season', '6', 'tied', 'together', 'single', 'overarching', 'plot', 'first', 'episode', 'Larry', 'wife', 'take', 'family', 'displaced', 'recent', 'hurricane', 'Black', 'Family', 'name', 'mirrors', 'race', 'joke', 'not', 'lost', 'Larry', 'work', 'way', 'episode', 'extra', 'source', 'frustration', 'perpetually', 'exasperated', 'hero', 'source', 'alternative', 'perspective', 'when', 'providing', 'Larry', 'advice', 'example', 'art', 'imitating', 'life', 'second', 'extended', 'plot', 'involving', 'breakdown', 'Larry', 'marriage', 'just', 'going', 'divorce', 'proceedings', 'real', 'life', 'Cheryl', 'character', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'important', 'Season', '6', 'also', 'possibly', 'product', 'Larry', 'real', 'life', 'matrimonial', 'problems', 'frustrations', 'Cheryl', 'take', 'meaner', 'more', 'mocking', 'tone', 'absurd', 'reaction', 'Larry', 'Blacks', 'desire', 'use', 'non-recycled', 'toilet', 'paper', 'being', 'best', 'example', 'Larry', 'real', 'life', 'soon-to-be', 'former', 'wife', 'champion', 'environmental', 'other', 'causes', 'trait', 'shares', 'Cheryl', 'one', 'Season', 'Six', 'paints', 'nave', 'misguided.Richard', 'Lewis', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'continue', 'real', 'life', 'roles', 'Larry', 'friends', 'have', 'problems', 'mocking', 'own', 'image', 'where', 'else', 'can', 'see', 'great', 'moments', 'uninvited', 'drunken', 'limo', 'driver', 'crashing', 'party', 'taunting', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'calling', 'Becker', 'Season', '6', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'Senator', 'Barbara', 'Boxer', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'small', 'parts', 'bravely', 'portraying', 'exaggerated', 'ridiculous', 'version', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'one', 'perfectly', 'Larry', 'David', 'view', 'world', 'one', 'spirit', 'irresistible', 'show']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 6
1105219,A2O0LIVTTFU75I,B000VXK6Z0,W Mianecke,"[0, 0]","I love CURB and I really enjoyed this season. Episodes like the one with John McEnroe surprised me and made me laugh out loud. I just wish Larry David would stop falling back on lazy, repeated  attempts at humor. For example- the Larry-and-another-character-stare-each-other-down-with-the-same-music-playing-each-time schtick. It's painful to watch and it wastes time that could be used to better effect. And the Larry-doesn't-let-something-go-and-insults-someone-who-turns-out-to-be-directly-involved-with-something-he-needs-later-in-the-episode routine. It's just like when SEINFELD started to rely too much on coincidences to tie together every subplot almost every week.Give me more of the wonderful moments when Larry is brutally honest yet charming. And SURPRISE us more often, Larry. Like when he is supportive of Susie in getting the doggie bag at the restaurant. The funny misunderstanding where his father falls in love with the ""happy ending"" masseusse. Or when he prepares a garden plot for Auntie Raye. Or when he asks Loretta to dance. Or the incredible scene when both he AND Cheryl are reacting to the truth of the cake Funkhouser had served them. I love it when he and Cheryl are equally guilty of being dishonest- as with the showing-up-on-the-wrong-day-for-the-party.I get frustrated with the far-fetched aspects of the stories. For example, there really is no reason for Larry to say as much as he does at Sammi's bat mitzvah. It's a cheap attempt at an extra laugh. It's way too insensitive, even for Larry's character. It borders on cruelty. And WHY would his character stay with a therapist like Steve Coogan's character in the first place? He would've dismissed him as incompetent almost immediately. I loved Steve's guest appearance, but, come ON, Larry! Why would Ted Danson invite him back ANYWHERE after what he does at his birthday? And WHY would Antoinette stay with him after the way he yells at her in front of Richard Lewis?Yeah, I know, it's TV, not real life, and it's not scripted, it's an improv show, but improv BETTER, Larry. work with less hackneyed outlines.
