""Daniel""","[1, 1]","The first TV pilot of COLUMBO, PRESCRIPTION: MURDER, was broadcasted on Feb. 20th, 1968, more than three years before the broadcasting of the first episode. It's also possible to see this pilot in the DVD standard by purchasingColumbo - The Complete First Season. Gene Barry, the first mean guy who ever confronted Columbo, is mostly appreciated by movie buffs because he starred in two Samuel Fuller films :Forty GunsandChina Gate.We have to accept it: there is a huge difference between this pilot and the Columbo episodes of the first season. For example, PRESCRIPTION: MURDER looks a lot more like a stage play and still belongs to the TV world of the sixties. But there are also in it a few sparkles that announce the grandness of the first episodes. I'm specially thinking here about the scene when Dr. Ray Flemming, a psychiatrist, dissects the way and the recipes Columbo uses with the suspects. This scene alone is worth the 99 minutes of this TV movie.A VHS for the Columbo buffs.",3,PILOT NUMBER ONE,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,990,"['first', 'TV', 'pilot', 'COLUMBO', 'PRESCRIPTION', 'MURDER', 'was', 'broadcasted', 'Feb.', '20th', '1968', 'more', 'three', 'years', 'broadcasting', 'first', 'episode', 'also', 'possible', 'see', 'pilot', 'DVD', 'standard', 'purchasingColumbo', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'first', 'mean', 'guy', 'who', 'ever', 'confronted', 'Columbo', 'mostly', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'buffs', 'starred', 'two', 'Samuel', 'Fuller', 'films', 'Forty', 'GunsandChina', 'Gate.We', 'have', 'accept', 'huge', 'difference', 'pilot', 'Columbo', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'example', 'PRESCRIPTION', 'MURDER', 'lot', 'more', 'stage', 'play', 'still', 'TV', 'world', 'sixties', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'sparkles', 'announce', 'grandness', 'first', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'specially', 'thinking', 'here', 'scene', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Ray', 'Flemming', 'psychiatrist', 'way', 'recipes', 'Columbo', 'suspects', 'scene', 'alone', '99', 'minutes', 'TV', 'movie.A', 'VHS', 'Columbo', 'buffs']",Columbo: Prescription for Murder The Premiere Collection  VHS

361909,A20CR4907G7CTS,6303186866,Jeff Marzano,"[8, 12]",For those old enough to remember Columbo was I think one of a family of tv movies that were all part of 'The Sunday Mystery Movie'.  Some of the other mystery types shows in the group were McMillan And Wife and a cowbody type detective (Dennis Weaver ?).The Columbo series is a true classic.  I don't think I've ever seen an episode of Columbo that I didn't like.'Prescription Murder' was the premier episode for the Columbo series.  The Columbo character in this first movie is a little different than the other episodes I've seen.  The series creators made some adjustments to the character after this movie.  They generally softenned up the character in the later episodes even including giving him a softer hair style.  However that's what makes this movie interesting also.The villain in this case is a psychiatrist who gives Columbo a psychological evaluation.  This is interesting.  It really defines the character as far as he lulls people into a sense of false security while constantly waiting for the suspect to get careless and reveal something.If I recall correctly Peter Falk played a bad guy in 'Murder Incorporated' but I don't think that was a great casting job.True greatness in a movie character I think requires perfect casting.  The casting of Peter Falk as Lieutenant Columbo was a stroke of genius by someone.  I suspect perfect casting only occurs when the character shares some personality traits with the actor in real life.For some reason just lately I was thinking about the Columbo movies and I took out the videos and watched a lot of them again.  It's probably a sign that something is good when you can watch them many times and still enjoy them.There's usually some pretty girls in the Columbo movies and this one is no exception.These movies are good too because they get into human nature and the good and evil in people.The plots themselves are totally contrived and would never really happen.  In real life civilians would never be allowed to interact so closely with detectives.  Also many things that Columbo does to catch people are against the law in real life such as tricking people.But that doesn't hurt the movies at all.  In fact if they were more realistic they probably wouldn't be any fun to watch.Columbo - The Complete Sixth and Seventh Seasons,5,Columbo Series A True Classic,1029628800,"08 18, 2002",2002,2295,"['old', 'enough', 'remember', 'Columbo', 'was', 'think', 'one', 'family', 'tv', 'movies', 'were', 'part', ""'The"", 'Sunday', 'Mystery', 'Movie', 'other', 'mystery', 'types', 'group', 'were', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'cowbody', 'type', 'detective', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', '.The', 'Columbo', 'series', 'true', 'classic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'episode', 'Columbo', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', ""'Prescription"", 'Murder', 'was', 'premier', 'episode', 'Columbo', 'series', 'Columbo', 'character', 'first', 'movie', 'little', 'different', 'other', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'creators', 'made', 'adjustments', 'character', 'movie', 'generally', 'softenned', 'up', 'character', 'later', 'episodes', 'even', 'including', 'giving', 'softer', 'hair', 'style', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'interesting', 'also.The', 'villain', 'case', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'Columbo', 'psychological', 'evaluation', 'interesting', 'really', 'character', 'as', 'far', 'people', 'sense', 'false', 'security', 'constantly', 'waiting', 'suspect', 'get', 'careless', 'reveal', 'something.If', 'recall', 'correctly', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'played', 'bad', 'guy', ""'Murder"", 'Incorporated', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'great', 'casting', 'job.True', 'greatness', 'movie', 'character', 'think', 'perfect', 'casting', 'casting', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Lieutenant', 'Columbo', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'someone', 'suspect', 'perfect', 'casting', 'only', 'when', 'character', 'shares', 'personality', 'traits', 'actor', 'real', 'life.For', 'reason', 'just', 'lately', 'was', 'thinking', 'Columbo', 'movies', 'took', 'out', 'videos', 'watched', 'lot', 'again', 'probably', 'sign', 'something', 'good', 'when', 'can', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'enjoy', 'usually', 'pretty', 'girls', 'Columbo', 'movies', 'one', 'exception.These', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'get', 'human', 'nature', 'good', 'evil', 'people.The', 'plots', 'are', 'totally', 'contrived', 'would', 'never', 'really', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'civilians', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'interact', 'so', 'closely', 'detectives', 'Also', 'many', 'things', 'Columbo', 'catch', 'people', 'are', 'law', 'real', 'life', 'such', 'tricking', 'people.But', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'movies', 'fact', 'were', 'more', 'realistic', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fun', 'watch.Columbo', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Seventh', 'Seasons']",Columbo: Prescription for Murder The Premiere Collection  VHS
361910,A3UJUVPDP4XF3B,6303186866,"Lesley M. Schultz ""msthoth""","[9, 11]","I don't know if this made-for-TV movie was intended as a series pilot, as it isn't obvious from the way it was put together, but whether it was or not has nothing to do with the quality of the film.  It's excellent. We have been accustomed by now to expect the rumpled-looking, cigar-smoking, affable-but-apparently-ditzy detective ""with just one more question, sir/ma'm...""  These qualities exist in the pilot but not at all to the same degree.  This earliest Columbo is a much more clever-seeming man, with less of the schtick we've come to know and love, and more of the raw power of his intellect and his relentless probing energy.  Columbo badgers a reluctant witness/accomplice!!!! I don't think we ever see that again in any of the rest of the series.  That scene absolutely takes one's breath away, used as we are to a much gentler, more cajoling manner-even with the miscreants [or perhaps especially with the miscreants.]  Gene Barry, who plays the criminal mastermind, does an excellent job as a conniving, almost evil adulterer (...).  He is a psychiatrist, and we are treated to a psychological reading of why Columbo uses his camoflague of the wrinkled raincoat, the sheepish expression, the shy and affable but continual pestering.  I won't reveal what it is, but it is interesting. Columbo takes it for what it's worth, and the audience will too.  If you are a Columbo fan, I highly recommend viewing it.",4,Great Pilot....A Must-See for all Columbo Fans,1005091200,"11 7, 2001",2001,1420,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'series', 'pilot', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'way', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'was', 'not', 'nothing', 'do', 'quality', 'film', 'excellent', 'have', 'been', 'accustomed', 'now', 'expect', 'rumpled-looking', 'cigar-smoking', 'affable-but-apparently-ditzy', 'detective', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'question', 'sir/ma', ""'m"", 'qualities', 'exist', 'pilot', 'not', 'same', 'degree', 'earliest', 'Columbo', 'much', 'more', 'clever-seeming', 'man', 'less', 'schtick', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'love', 'more', 'raw', 'power', 'intellect', 'relentless', 'probing', 'energy', 'Columbo', 'reluctant', 'witness/accomplice', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'rest', 'series', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'one', 'breath', 'away', 'used', 'are', 'much', 'gentler', 'more', 'cajoling', 'manner-even', 'miscreants', '[', 'perhaps', 'especially', 'miscreants', ']', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'who', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'excellent', 'job', 'conniving', 'almost', 'evil', 'adulterer', 'psychiatrist', 'are', 'treated', 'psychological', 'reading', 'why', 'Columbo', 'camoflague', 'wrinkled', 'raincoat', 'sheepish', 'expression', 'shy', 'affable', 'continual', 'pestering', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'what', 'interesting', 'Columbo', 'what', 'worth', 'audience', 'will', 'too', 'are', 'Columbo', 'fan', 'highly', 'recommend', 'viewing']",Columbo: Prescription for Murder The Premiere Collection  VHS
361911,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,6303186866,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[17, 19]","People forget that ""Columbo"" started out not as a 1970s TV series, but as a single TV movie in 1968 that pitted an arrogant genius against a streetwise bulldog of a detective.  Falk is wonderful as a criminal's worst nightmare-a rumpled little man who disarms his opponents with his cheap suits and scatterbrained demeanor.  In ""Prescription:  Murder,"" Columbo is considerably more polished-and aggressive-than in the TV series in his attempt to take down a psychiatrist (played regally by the always-polished Gene Barry) who's murdered his wife in what he thinks is the perfect crime.  The production is sumptuous for television fare, with sets and color that rival cinema productions of the time, and even if all of the Columbo telefilms essentially copy Alfred Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder,"" the story is quite satisfying.  As was standard for the time, the best part of ""Prescription: Murder"" is watching two great actors spar with each other in a plot that is more chessmatch than car chase.
