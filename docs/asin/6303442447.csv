When Christmas rolls around, there are several of these films that get to see the light of day again for a while. While ""The Santa Clause"" may not be ""A Christmas Story"" or ""It's A Wonderful Life"" to some people, it is still an incredibly fun and entertaining family classic for everyone. Tim Allen, who at this time was the king of the tube with ""Home Improvement"", stars as Scott Calvin. He is a divorcee with a son named Charlie(Eric Lloyd), and is an executive at a toy company. The holidays come around and Tim and Charlie have their yearly visit. It's no surprise that Scott doesn't especially care for Charlie's stepdad Neil(Judge Reinhold). That's another story. One night, Scott hears something on the roof and goes to investigate. He yells at the strange man who is on his roof. The man slips and falls and dies. He is Santa Claus. Scott refuses to believe it at first, but Charlie is excited as all get out. Scott takes over the reins for the night until a suitable replacement comes. Scott learns that he is the permanent replacement. He is swooped away to the north pole and meets all of the elves who fill him in on what is going on....and who he will be. Then, over the course of the year and into the next holiday season, Scott gradually changes. White hair and a belly that shakes like a bowl full of jelly take over Scott. He is now, truly, Santa Claus. This all causes Scott's ex wife(Wendy Crewson) and Neil, who is a psychiatrist by the way, to think Scott has lost his mind and is messing with Charlie's in the process. The reason this movie works is because of Tim Allen. Sure, you can have a number of people in the role, but Tim has such an endearing charm and likeability to him, that he makes the moment his. It's his movie and one can't think, or want, anyone else in the role. That has been his key to such popularity for all these years. He's like a best bud. Everybody else in the film do fine jobs, but it is Tim's movie, and they all blend into the background. The movie has a nice, warm, magical feel to it. Makes you want it to be Christmas. It's a by the numbers script, but I don't think anyone will care or mind that they can pretty much figure out what is going to happen. It's not about that. It's about make believe. It's about fantasy. It's about being a kid and finding that kid in all of us. It does the heart good.",4,Believe....,1035676800,"10 27, 2002",2002,2463,"['certain', 'time', 'year', 'where', 'certain', 'kinds', 'films', 'get', 'yearly', 'taken', 'out', 'watched', 'When', 'Christmas', 'around', 'are', 'several', 'films', 'get', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'again', 'while', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'people', 'still', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'family', 'classic', 'everyone', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'king', 'tube', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'divorcee', 'son', 'named', 'Charlie', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'executive', 'toy', 'company', 'holidays', 'come', 'around', 'Tim', 'Charlie', 'have', 'yearly', 'visit', 'surprise', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'especially', 'care', 'Charlie', 'stepdad', 'Neil', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'story', 'One', 'night', 'Scott', 'something', 'roof', 'investigate', 'strange', 'man', 'who', 'roof', 'man', 'falls', 'dies', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Scott', 'believe', 'first', 'Charlie', 'excited', 'get', 'out', 'Scott', 'over', 'reins', 'night', 'suitable', 'replacement', 'Scott', 'permanent', 'replacement', 'swooped', 'away', 'north', 'pole', 'elves', 'who', 'fill', 'what', 'going', '.and', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'Then', 'course', 'year', 'next', 'holiday', 'season', 'Scott', 'gradually', 'White', 'hair', 'belly', 'shakes', 'bowl', 'full', 'jelly', 'take', 'over', 'Scott', 'now', 'truly', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Scott', 'ex', 'wife', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'Neil', 'who', 'psychiatrist', 'way', 'think', 'Scott', 'lost', 'mind', 'messing', 'Charlie', 'process', 'reason', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Sure', 'can', 'have', 'number', 'people', 'role', 'Tim', 'endearing', 'charm', 'likeability', 'moment', 'movie', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'want', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'been', 'key', 'such', 'popularity', 'years', 'best', 'bud', 'Everybody', 'else', 'film', 'do', 'fine', 'jobs', 'Tim', 'movie', 'blend', 'background', 'movie', 'nice', 'warm', 'magical', 'feel', 'Makes', 'want', 'be', 'Christmas', 'numbers', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'will', 'care', 'mind', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'not', 'about', 'make', 'believe', 'fantasy', 'being', 'kid', 'finding', 'heart', 'good']",The Santa Clause VHS

The quick and dirty synopsis of the plot is that Scot Calvin (Tim Allen) is an executive at a toy company, divorced with a young son who is doing well, but has kind of lost his way when it comes to the spirit of Christmas.  On Christmas Eve his son wakes him because of a racket outside and they discover Santa on the roof.  Startled, Santa takes a tumble off and after Scot puts on the coat & hat the adventure begins as he takes the reigns as the new Santa.The movie itself is fun, cute, and of course... safe for kids.  It's got a little going on for adults as well, but the target audience is absolutely kids.  My 10 year old will sit through it without protest and the 3 year old really likes Santa, the elves, and of course the reindeer.  It's no Home Alone, but if you are looking to round out your more recent Christmas classics, this is a title worth owning.If you're looking for one of the best, not really kid safe Christmas movies... pick up a copy of ""The Ref"" as well and watch it after the kids go to bed.

It was more about Jack Frost, the King of the Chill, than Santa outside the domestic situation. Jack, played skillfully by Martin Short, was a gay big phony with freeze-dried hair -- atyled like some young people wear theirs today. He was a manipulator, a jack of all trades, but mean and nasty as a conspirator to take North Pole away from Santa and his elves. Jack appeared to be happy as a lark, but he changed and turned into an ogre out to sabotage Christmas.

During this particular Christmas, Scott's son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), comes for a visit while his mother, Laura (Wendy Crewson) and her new husband, Dr. Neil Miller (Judge Reinhold) go away. Charlie is reluclent at first staying with his father...especially after Scott accidentally burns the turkey dinner and they have to eat at Denny's restuarant. After Scott tells Charlie the 'Night Before Christmas' story and he goes to sleep, Charlie hears a ""clatter"" on the roof ""just like in the poem,"" as he says to Scott. So Scott goes outside to see what is wrong, when he is shocked to find Santa Clause on the roof! Appearently, Santa is also shocked to see him, so Santa falls off the roof and dies. Now, Scott (after putting on the Santa suit, getting in the sleigh, and bringing the preasents to the rest of the houses), is the new Santa Clause...only he doesn't realize this until after he and Charlie are brought to the North Pole and are introduced to the Arch Elf, Bernard (David Krumholtz), who tells him that he is indeed, Santa, by showing him the ""binding contract"" on the little card Scott found in the red suit. Now Scott is stuck doing something he really doesn't want to do or believes in, and he has one year to start looking like the real Santa. And if Charlie doesn't stop telling everyone that he's Santa Clause, Scott will be in a heap of trouble--especially with Laura and Neil, who feel that Charlie's strong belief in Santa Clause isn't good for him, and even try to prevent Charlie from seeing Scott when they think Scott is encouraging him.OVERALL THOUGHTS: First of all, the acting...is absolutely superb! Tim Allen is perfect as the new-but-obligated Santa Clause. Eric Lloyd is cute and charming as Charlie, and the rest of the cast is brilliant. The storyline is humorous and fun--who wouldn't laugh when Scott keeps forgetting Bernard's name, or is making fun of Neil, or when they first arrive at the North Pole? The directing is wonderful, and the script is well-written. The special effects are darn good, too.This special edition DVD is wonderfully packaged with a limited time movie pass to ""The Santa Clause 2: Mrs. Clause"" (the brand new sequel), exclusive sneak peak at the sequel, an original featurette, trivia game, holiday recipes, and DVD-ROM extras. The DVD is available in both wide screen and full frame formats.I highly recommend ""The Santa Clause"".Score:100/100A+",5,Holiday film classic!,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,2608,"['Santa', 'Clause', 'directed', 'John', 'Pasquin', 'upbeat', 'Christmas', 'tale', 'classic', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'love.PLOT', 'SUMMARY', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'divorced', 'dad', 'who', 'co-owns', 'toy', 'company', 'particular', 'Christmas', 'Scott', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'visit', 'mother', 'Laura', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'new', 'husband', 'Dr.', 'Neil', 'Miller', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'go', 'away', 'Charlie', 'reluclent', 'first', 'staying', 'father', 'especially', 'Scott', 'accidentally', 'turkey', 'dinner', 'have', 'eat', 'Denny', 'restuarant', 'Scott', 'Charlie', ""'Night"", 'Before', 'Christmas', 'story', 'sleep', 'Charlie', 'clatter', 'roof', 'just', 'poem', 'Scott', 'So', 'Scott', 'outside', 'see', 'what', 'wrong', 'when', 'shocked', 'find', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'roof', 'Appearently', 'Santa', 'also', 'shocked', 'see', 'so', 'Santa', 'roof', 'dies', 'Now', 'Scott', 'putting', 'Santa', 'suit', 'getting', 'sleigh', 'bringing', 'preasents', 'rest', 'houses', 'new', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'only', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Charlie', 'are', 'brought', 'North', 'Pole', 'are', 'introduced', 'Arch', 'Elf', 'Bernard', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'who', 'indeed', 'Santa', 'showing', 'binding', 'contract', 'little', 'card', 'Scott', 'found', 'red', 'suit', 'Now', 'Scott', 'stuck', 'doing', 'something', 'really', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'one', 'year', 'start', 'looking', 'real', 'Santa', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'stop', 'telling', 'everyone', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Scott', 'will', 'be', 'heap', 'trouble', 'especially', 'Laura', 'Neil', 'who', 'feel', 'Charlie', 'strong', 'belief', 'Santa', 'Clause', ""n't"", 'good', 'even', 'try', 'prevent', 'Charlie', 'seeing', 'Scott', 'when', 'think', 'Scott', 'encouraging', 'him.OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'First', 'all', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'perfect', 'new-but-obligated', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'cute', 'charming', 'Charlie', 'rest', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'storyline', 'humorous', 'fun', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'when', 'Scott', 'forgetting', 'Bernard', 'name', 'making', 'fun', 'Neil', 'when', 'first', 'arrive', 'North', 'Pole', 'directing', 'wonderful', 'script', 'well-written', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'darn', 'good', 'too.This', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'wonderfully', 'packaged', 'limited', 'time', 'movie', 'pass', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'brand', 'new', 'sequel', 'exclusive', 'sneak', 'peak', 'sequel', 'original', 'featurette', 'trivia', 'game', 'holiday', 'recipes', 'DVD-ROM', 'extras', 'DVD', 'available', 'wide', 'screen', 'full', 'frame', 'formats.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Santa', 'Clause', '.Score:100/100A+']",The Santa Clause VHS

Now combine that humor of his with Disney, well, you just HAVE to have this! This DVD has got to be one of our very favorite NEW Christmas movies. It's just a very neat, well done story on how Santa Claus gets started and changes over the years. Something we've all wondered at some point. When Allen decides to put on the Santa suit and becomes the man himself, well, it's just a great, great story. I love the part when they show his bedroom at the North Pole and there he is, sleigh bed and all! I showed my son that Santa does actually sleep in a sleigh bed and well, now he has one and just has no trouble going to sleep in it! Hey, whatever works! Another part when Allen doesn't want to do the Santa thing and says so - the reaction of all the elves is just heartbreaking. What a great movie with such creativity and just all over feel good about Christmas. Elves with Attitude is a pretty funny section too. I honestly don't think anyone else could have pulled off this movie like Allen did. I had no idea that he was such a great storyteller until this movie came out.

As you can see from other's reviews, this is an absolutely terrific film.  If you are wondering whether or not to get it, get it and, if you have even the tiniest good feelings about Christmas, you won't be disappointed.That said, someone at Disney aught to be taken out and slapped for the dismal way this movie's ""Special Edition"" was treated.  Admittedly, if you want to finally upgrade to the Widescreen version of this film (as everyone should), this is your chance.  Beyond that, however, this DVD is an unworthy homage to a terrific film.  There are no commentaries, no production notes, not even the usual fare of trailers from the film.  What is there is an absurd featurette where the actor playing Bernard comes out and gives a pep talk to a group of elves plus some holiday recipes.Maybe I'm over-reacting, but I figure that, with this release in advance of The Santa Clause 2, they would have really loaded this up.  Director commentaries are a must and, with Disney practically owning Tim Allen, a commentary with him and some of the other stars would have been great added value.  The movie is great, as my rating references, but this is NOT a Special Edition, no matter what it says on the case.Anyone buying this should enjoy the movie and write Disney and complain about its treatment.",5,A Great Movie - a not so Special Edition,1036454400,"11 5, 2002",2002,1424,"['possible', 'exception', 'White', 'Christmas', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'best', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'films', 'went', 'color', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'film', 'are', 'wondering', 'not', 'get', 'get', 'have', 'even', 'tiniest', 'good', 'feelings', 'Christmas', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.That', 'said', 'someone', 'Disney', 'aught', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'slapped', 'dismal', 'way', 'movie', 'Special', 'Edition', 'was', 'treated', 'Admittedly', 'want', 'finally', 'upgrade', 'Widescreen', 'version', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'chance', 'however', 'DVD', 'unworthy', 'homage', 'terrific', 'film', 'are', 'commentaries', 'production', 'notes', 'not', 'even', 'usual', 'fare', 'trailers', 'film', 'What', 'absurd', 'featurette', 'where', 'actor', 'playing', 'Bernard', 'out', 'pep', 'talk', 'group', 'elves', 'holiday', 'recipes.Maybe', ""'m"", 'over-reacting', 'figure', 'release', 'advance', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'loaded', 'up', 'Director', 'commentaries', 'are', 'must', 'Disney', 'practically', 'owning', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'commentary', 'other', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'added', 'value', 'movie', 'great', 'rating', 'references', 'NOT', 'Special', 'Edition', 'matter', 'what', 'case.Anyone', 'buying', 'should', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'write', 'Disney', 'complain', 'treatment']",The Santa Clause VHS

374686,A2MW0RYIXMEYGS,6303442447,Dave,"[0, 1]","I heard about The Santa Claus movie a long time ago, but was never motivated to see it until after purchasing the sequel, which appeared even more family friendly than the first. You will definitely want to see them in order, but there are a few slight moments of objectionable content in this first movie, while I'll mention in a second.PLOT: Scott Calvin is a divorced father, an executive of an advertising company, and getting set for a Christmas time visit from his son. Little Charlie isn't thrilled to be with his *other* dad for Christmas, especially when Christmas dinner equals Denny's. Charlie awakens Scott in the middle of the night when hearing thumping noises on the roof. Scott steps outside and hollers at the perpetrator on his roof - and looks on in stunned disbelief as a red-suited figure comes tumbling down. Scott finds a card in the fellow's pocket saying ""If something should happen to me, put on my suit, the reindeer will know what to do."" Climbing up on a magic ladder, Scott finds himself face-to-face with eight not-so-tiny reindeer...and one long night's work. He finds himself at the North Pole at the end of his journey, where head-elf Bernard irritably informs Scott that, according to the Santa Clause (the clause in the contract, as stated in microscopic text on the card he removed from Santa's pocket) he's the new Big Guy himself. Scott is returned home in disbelief, and must decide whether or not to accept the job ... all the while in trouble with Charlie's parents when Charlie tells them the tall tale of the North Pole visit.GOOD POINTS: With a few exceptions, most of the humor in the movie is clean and humorous. And, again with a few exceptions, the whole movie is family-friendly, and a great holiday classic for everyone to sit down and watch.BAD POINTS: There's a lot of discussion about whether or not Santa Claus is real. Charlie doesn't believe at first, and when he does after visiting the North Pole, his other father Neil attempts to dissuade him by raising numerous objections as to how Santa could do that. Neil and Charlie's mother Laura discuss the times they stopped believing in Santa. There's also some potty humor found in such things as Scott passing gas early one morning. Scott also hollers at a neighbor that he usually sleeps ""butt-naked"". During his first night taking over for Santa, he isn't very nice to one young girl who wakes up to see him, and grumbles about passing out the other gifts. There's also several ""Oh my god"" exclamations. Most of these ""bad points"" are minor, but might raise objections for those searching for a thoroughly clean family film.THOUGHTS: The question of Big Red's validity will probably be raised again by this movie, even though he is proven by Scott's North Pole visit. But if you don't mind that, and a few other parts like those listed above, then you'll want to buy this movie. Six and a half out of ten stars.DVD BONUSES: Minimal. I'm guessing this was among the first few to enter DVD-dom because of the small extras. There's an interactive game you can play (keep Santa airborne by ducking flocks of geese, and chimneys) a Make Santa Snacks with some Chef you've never heard of but are supposed to have, and a ""So You Wanna Be An Elf?"" feature, which is an early attempt at a behind-the-scenes feature, but didn't quite make it.",4,Great holiday flick,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,3341,"['heard', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'was', 'never', 'motivated', 'see', 'purchasing', 'sequel', 'appeared', 'even', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'first', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'see', 'order', 'are', 'few', 'slight', 'moments', 'objectionable', 'content', 'first', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'second.PLOT', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'divorced', 'father', 'executive', 'advertising', 'company', 'getting', 'set', 'Christmas', 'time', 'visit', 'son', 'Little', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'be', '*other*', 'dad', 'Christmas', 'especially', 'when', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'equals', 'Denny', 'Charlie', 'Scott', 'middle', 'night', 'when', 'hearing', 'thumping', 'noises', 'roof', 'Scott', 'steps', 'outside', 'hollers', 'perpetrator', 'roof', 'stunned', 'disbelief', 'red-suited', 'figure', 'tumbling', 'down', 'Scott', 'card', 'fellow', 'pocket', 'saying', 'something', 'should', 'happen', 'put', 'suit', 'reindeer', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Climbing', 'up', 'magic', 'ladder', 'Scott', 'face-to-face', 'eight', 'not-so-tiny', 'reindeer', 'one', 'long', 'night', 'work', 'North', 'Pole', 'end', 'journey', 'where', 'head-elf', 'Bernard', 'irritably', 'informs', 'Scott', 'according', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'clause', 'contract', 'stated', 'microscopic', 'text', 'card', 'removed', 'Santa', 'pocket', 'new', 'Big', 'Guy', 'Scott', 'returned', 'home', 'disbelief', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'accept', 'job', 'while', 'trouble', 'Charlie', 'parents', 'when', 'Charlie', 'tall', 'tale', 'North', 'Pole', 'visit.GOOD', 'POINTS', 'few', 'exceptions', 'most', 'humor', 'movie', 'clean', 'humorous', 'again', 'few', 'exceptions', 'whole', 'movie', 'family-friendly', 'great', 'holiday', 'classic', 'everyone', 'sit', 'down', 'watch.BAD', 'POINTS', 'lot', 'discussion', 'not', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'real', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'believe', 'first', 'when', 'visiting', 'North', 'Pole', 'other', 'father', 'Neil', 'dissuade', 'raising', 'numerous', 'objections', 'how', 'Santa', 'could', 'do', 'Neil', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'Laura', 'times', 'stopped', 'believing', 'Santa', 'also', 'potty', 'humor', 'found', 'such', 'things', 'Scott', 'passing', 'gas', 'early', 'one', 'morning', 'Scott', 'also', 'neighbor', 'usually', 'butt-naked', 'first', 'night', 'taking', 'Santa', ""n't"", 'very', 'nice', 'one', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'see', 'grumbles', 'passing', 'out', 'other', 'gifts', 'also', 'several', 'Oh', 'god', 'exclamations', 'Most', 'bad', 'points', 'are', 'minor', 'might', 'raise', 'objections', 'searching', 'thoroughly', 'clean', 'family', 'film.THOUGHTS', 'question', 'Big', 'Red', 'validity', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'raised', 'again', 'movie', 'even', 'proven', 'Scott', 'North', 'Pole', 'visit', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'few', 'other', 'parts', 'listed', 'above', 'then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'buy', 'movie', 'Six', 'half', 'ten', 'stars.DVD', 'BONUSES', 'Minimal', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'first', 'few', 'enter', 'DVD-dom', 'small', 'extras', 'interactive', 'game', 'can', 'play', 'keep', 'Santa', 'airborne', 'ducking', 'flocks', 'geese', 'chimneys', 'Make', 'Santa', 'Snacks', 'Chef', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'So', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Elf', 'feature', 'early', 'attempt', 'behind-the-scenes', 'feature', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make']",The Santa Clause VHS

There's some hilarious little gimmicks, but overall it's an honest, just plain sweet story. Tim Allen's great for the role of cynic-turned-Santa I that I would never have expected...really! He IS Santa, man. Eric Lloyd, who plays Santa's son, is an adorable but atypically not-[cruddy] child actor! yow!

Portrayed by the magnificent David Krumholtz, he's the cranky head-elf who manages to DEAL with the new Santa. Come on, everyone loves Bernard.

Scott Calvin accidentally causes Santa Claus to fall off the roof on Christmas Eve, and, when he decides to put on his suit, he becomes Santa. He has one year to get thing settled, and then must return to deliver gifts to all the children.Scott is trying to bring some Christmas cheer for his son Charlie, but he has no idea that all this is in store for him.There are plenty of quick one-liners for Tim Allen, as he tries to explain away why his son is suddenly calling him ""Santa Claus"" ( a funny scene is when the kids introduce their parents and what they do for a living at school). Another great scene, as mentioned by other reviewers, is the one where Scott burns the turkey and winds up in Denny's (""the American Institution"" as he calls it) with all the other fathers who have also burned their dinner.Scott at first does not believe or accept his role as Santa, but as he learns more from his visit to the North Pole, and as he starts to put on the pounds and pyscially become Santa, then he feels obligated to take on the role. He also tries to patch things up with his ex-wife and her boyfriend.Sure, you probably can predict the ending from a mile away, but that really isn't what this film is about.

This Sinter Klaus was changed to Santa Claus for English-speaking countries where he adopted the role of the more generic character of 'Father Christmas'. Since the dawn of Xmas Commercialism the Santa image has been used by pretty much everyone to sell their crappy products. THIS is how kids in modern society are introduced to a such a ridiculous fantasy figure. Why do any parents feed their kids this nonsensical crap? Imagination is fine. But lying to them about something that a 5-year-old should be able to see through is stupid.That said, as purely a fantasy movie, The Santa Clause is quite amusing. But maybe a bit too obnoxious to be a Xmas Classic. It was only made to cash-in on Tim Allen's Home Improvement success (and directed by a Home Improvement director) on the Disney Channel (which is even referenced rather unsubtly). I suppose it was a lucrative idea, but since I believe Tim Allen is completely talentless it's not really his own success. Santa Claus sells. Not Tim Allen. That's why all his other movies have been complete failures.Allen plays the curiously initialled Scott Calvin, a man who accidentally kills Santa on Xmas Eve. Once he puts on the dead man's jacket he becomes the new Santa and is whisked away to the North Pole. Over the next year he undergoes a transformation from ordinary guy to fat, jolly fellow with a big, white beard. Much to the shock of his ex-wife and baffled boss Peter Boyle (who would later star in the sequels as Father Time).I know that this is strictly a movie for kids but even before I reached double digits I questioned the logic behind 'Santa'. Even the movie lacks basic sense-making. Why would anyone doubt the existence of the movie character Santa Claus? Who do they think delivers free gifts to their children every year? It doesn't add up! If you show this to your kids and back up the lunatic conspiracy that this junk is real then shame on you. If you tell them that it is a load of crap and that the film is strictly make-belief then bravo!This new DVD is an improvement on the last one (while not drastically) with an anamorphic 1.85:1 picture and Dolby 5.1 sound.

When he's inside the first house he takes out a plastic dump truck and it lightly thuds on the floor as he puts under the tree. In comes this Rottweiler growling at him. Scott puts on his most winning smile and says ""Nice teeth."" The dog barks at him. He tries to escape out of the window, but an alarm goes off. Someone upstairs yells ""Who's down there?!"" He inches his way towards the fireplace, with the dog growling at him, saying ""It's the holidays. Come on. Whoo-hoo-hoo."" All of a sudden there's a gunshot.

I love this happy, sentimental, magical, feel good movie.  Starring Tim Allen, THE SANTA CLAUSE will make you laugh, make you cry, and help you remember the true meaning of Christmas.  You WILL believe in Christmas magic.Tim Allen plays Scott Calvin (S. C., hint, hint), a divorced father doing his best to celebrate Christmas with his son.  In typical fashion, Scott is late picking up his son,  the turkey catches fire in the oven, they end up at Denny's for Christmas Eve dinner...overall, a complete disaster.  Later, as they read The Night Before Christmas, they hear a sound out on the roof. They run outside to investigate, startling Santa, who falls off the roof.  Scott tries to help Santa and ends up putting on the Santa suit to keep warm.  However, there is a Santa Clause on a card in the pocket of the coat...he who wears the suit becomes the next Santa.  Scott and his son end up in the sleigh delivering presents, and then at the North Pole meeting the elves.  Of course, no one believes them the next morning, and even Scott thinks it was all a dream.  But the Santification process has already begun, and eventually even Scott has to believe...Tim Allen is just excellent as both Scott Calvin, a toy company executive who has lost his way and as Santa Claus.  His transformation from one to the other is perfect:  his sense of shock and disbelief vanishes as learns the joy and magic of actually being Santa.  Tim's performance is warm, genuine, real, and very believable.  You want this to be real, and you want Scott Calvin to be Santa.  You feel happy, joyful, and uplifted.  The supporting cast is all wonderful, and the elves are just terrific.  The sets and effects comprising the North Pole and Santa's Workshop are just right.  They make you believe, which is the whole point.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SANTA CLAUSE for the entire family.  We watch it several times each Christmas, and love it every single time.",5,Seeing Isn't Believing.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 5]","Disney struck gold with this story about a man who becomes Santa Claus when the previous Santa Claus has an unfortunate accident.  Tim Allen is in one of his best roles, the script is generally fun and heart-warming, and kids seem to love this one.Scott Calvin is a toy company executive.  As seems to be a standard in many movies, Scott is divorced and only gets to see his son periodically; Christmas Eve is one of those visits.  After burning a turkey and heading for a thrilling meal at Denny's with all the other divorced fathers (note the stereotype that only fathers do not know how to cook), Scott reads ""The Night Before Christmas"" to Charlie before bed.Scott awakes when he hears a noise on the roof.  Thinking burglars, Scott runs outside, only to see a fat guy in a red suit on top of his roof.  Scott yells at the guy, startles him and the guy slides down and falls off the roof.  Unfortunately, the guy apparently seems down for the count.  Scott searches his pocket for identification and finds a card indicating the bearer is Santa Claus.The next thing Scott knows, the man in the red suit is gone, leaving the suit behind.  Scott can only do one thing; he puts the red suit on.  Scott spends a whirlwind night globe-trotting, and ends the night at the North Pole speaking with Bernard the Elf (David Krumholtz, who was perfect for the role, just as he is perfect as Charlie Eppes in ""Numbers"").  Bernard explains to Scott that by putting on the Santa suit Scott has invoked the Santa Clause, meaning the Scott will henceforth be the new Santa.When Scott wakes up the next day he wonders whether he had a dream.  Of course, we know better and soon Scott will as well.  Indeed, Scott suddenly puts on a lot of weight and seems to be capable of growing beards almost instantly (and capable of generating more than a few laughs).  Scott also has a very difficult time explaining his behavior and appearance to anyone, most especially his ex-wife Laura Miller (Wendy Crewson, ""Corrina, Corrina,"" ""Air Force One,"" and ""Eight Below"") and her new husband Dr. Neil Miller (Judge Reinhold, ""Stripes"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"").  While the movie becomes somewhat predictable at this point, it is funny and enjoyable to watch.  I most particularly enjoyed the end of the movie, which Disney managed to pull off in a very serious and sincere way.This movie does contain a few scenes that could be difficult to explain to very young children, perhaps ages 5 or 6 and younger.  This film should be suitable for most other family members.Disney has only a few Christmas movies that are fun, funny and heartwarming.  ""The Santa Clause"" is a worthy addition to Disney's family film library and the Christmas movie genre.

It's the usual time of the year when the holiday themed feature films are out in full force, flooding multiplexes across the country for the Thanksgiving holiday and going into December. And it seems work as usual for the Walt Disney Company with their release of The Santa Clause, but what makes this project unique is the concept it uses, one that has never fully been developed on the big screen before. The feature is also unique in that it stars Tim Allen, who is best known for his hit television show, Home Improvement, on ABC. Does that mean an automatic is lying in the waiting to flock to theaters for Allen's flick? Not necessarily. Granted there are people who are die hard fans who will love the actor/actress for whatever work they do but for others, they are pretty critical of television stars who believe they can easily make the jump to the big screen. Can Allen pull it off? Only the holiday box office will tell.The story centers around a man who goes from being divorced, self-centered business man to possibly the most care-free, charitable man on the planet, Santa Claus. Scott Calvin works for a toy company, has recently divorced from his wife, and is stuck on Christmas Eve with his son, who is just as excited as his father is being together for the holidays. Once he tucks his kid into bed for the night, Scott hears a noise on the roof and goes to investigate. When he tries to confront the man on the roof, he falls off and when Scott encounters him, the mystery man is dressed like Santa Claus. He and his son enter the sleigh and the puts on the Santa suit, all thanks to the urging of his son. When the sleigh returns to the North Pole after a long Christmas Eve, Scott discovers that he is the new Santa, thanks to the Santa Clause, which is a contract stating who ever puts on the suit becomes the new Santa Claus. He notices physical changes like the color of his hair and his weight but soon he notices that he feels more and more like Santa on the inside. The story for The Santa Clause is quite possibly one of the most original holiday films in years, which is surprising considering the concept is such a simple one that it is hard to believe that it has never fully been attempted before. The feature does a wonderful job at mixing comedic elements with emotional values, which is hard to do at times. The Santa Clause defies that and presents how it can be done right.The film revolves mostly around Tim Allen's character and generally that is all that really matters for the film but at the same time the character can be ruined if he doesn't interact with supporting cast members. Fortunately this doesn't happen here or at least not very often. Allen is marvelous in his role as Scott Calvin aka Santa Claus. He successfully translates the comedic magic he had on his television show and amplified it ten times. There is also a lot of emotion behind scenes that he has with his son, Charlie. David Krumholtz, who plays Bernard the head elf at Santa's workshop, is quite possibly the most enjoyable highlight of the film. He work extremely well with Allen as the two are able to play off each other in several moments within the film, that if they had been performed by anybody else would have been flat. The character of Charlie, Scott's son, is moderately played out by Eric Lloyd. Lloyd begins to get pretty annoying and whiny as the film progresses but then again what can you expect from a cute little kid?Overall, The Santa Clause, just like the big man himself, spreads holiday magic to every boy and girl, nobody how young or old they are. It is such an original concept, one that hasn't been seen and may never be seen again for many years. Though there is much to praise the film on, there are also slight things to pick at. The messages that the film tries to convey, though meaningful and expressive, came off as being too forced. It would have been better if the filmmakers had slowly sunk the ideas in the heads of movie-goers rather then what they ended up doing. And, as was stated earlier, Eric Lloyd came as being too cute and annoying at times in the film but this is something that doesn't necessarily mean anything major, just a small squabble. Make sure to avoid the tacky holiday films like the remake of Miracle on 34th Street and make it your duty to catch The Santa Clause instead, which is sure to become a new holiday classic for the entire family.",4,The Moose Hole - 'Santa' Delievers Holiday Magic,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,4445,"['Here', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'usual', 'time', 'year', 'when', 'holiday', 'themed', 'feature', 'films', 'are', 'out', 'full', 'force', 'flooding', 'multiplexes', 'country', 'Thanksgiving', 'holiday', 'going', 'December', 'work', 'as', 'usual', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'release', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'what', 'project', 'unique', 'concept', 'one', 'never', 'fully', 'been', 'developed', 'big', 'screen', 'feature', 'also', 'unique', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'hit', 'television', 'show', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'ABC', 'mean', 'automatic', 'lying', 'waiting', 'flock', 'theaters', 'Allen', 'flick', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'Granted', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'who', 'will', 'love', 'actor/actress', 'work', 'do', 'others', 'are', 'pretty', 'critical', 'television', 'stars', 'who', 'believe', 'can', 'easily', 'make', 'jump', 'big', 'screen', 'Can', 'Allen', 'pull', 'off', 'Only', 'holiday', 'box', 'office', 'will', 'tell.The', 'story', 'centers', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'divorced', 'self-centered', 'business', 'man', 'possibly', 'most', 'care-free', 'charitable', 'man', 'planet', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'toy', 'company', 'recently', 'divorced', 'wife', 'stuck', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'excited', 'father', 'being', 'together', 'holidays', 'Once', 'kid', 'bed', 'night', 'Scott', 'noise', 'roof', 'investigate', 'When', 'confront', 'man', 'roof', 'off', 'when', 'Scott', 'mystery', 'man', 'dressed', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'son', 'enter', 'sleigh', 'puts', 'Santa', 'suit', 'thanks', 'urging', 'son', 'When', 'sleigh', 'returns', 'North', 'Pole', 'long', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Scott', 'new', 'Santa', 'thanks', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'contract', 'stating', 'who', 'ever', 'suit', 'new', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'physical', 'changes', 'color', 'hair', 'weight', 'soon', 'more', 'more', 'Santa', 'inside', 'story', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'holiday', 'films', 'years', 'surprising', 'considering', 'concept', 'such', 'simple', 'one', 'hard', 'believe', 'never', 'fully', 'been', 'attempted', 'feature', 'wonderful', 'job', 'mixing', 'comedic', 'elements', 'emotional', 'values', 'hard', 'do', 'times', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'right.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'mostly', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'character', 'generally', 'really', 'matters', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'ruined', ""n't"", 'interact', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'Fortunately', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'least', 'not', 'very', 'often', 'Allen', 'marvelous', 'role', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'successfully', 'comedic', 'magic', 'had', 'television', 'show', 'amplified', 'ten', 'times', 'also', 'lot', 'emotion', 'scenes', 'son', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'who', 'Bernard', 'head', 'elf', 'Santa', 'workshop', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'highlight', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'Allen', 'two', 'are', 'able', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'several', 'moments', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'performed', 'anybody', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'flat', 'character', 'Charlie', 'Scott', 'son', 'moderately', 'played', 'out', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'Lloyd', 'get', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'whiny', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'cute', 'little', 'kid', 'Overall', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'just', 'big', 'man', 'holiday', 'magic', 'boy', 'girl', 'nobody', 'how', 'young', 'old', 'are', 'such', 'original', 'concept', 'one', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'much', 'praise', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'slight', 'things', 'pick', 'messages', 'film', 'tries', 'convey', 'meaningful', 'expressive', 'came', 'off', 'being', 'too', 'forced', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'slowly', 'sunk', 'ideas', 'heads', 'movie-goers', 'rather', 'then', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'was', 'stated', 'earlier', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'came', 'being', 'too', 'cute', 'annoying', 'times', 'film', 'something', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'anything', 'major', 'just', 'small', 'squabble', 'Make', 'sure', 'avoid', 'tacky', 'holiday', 'films', 'remake', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'make', 'duty', 'catch', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'instead', 'sure', 'become', 'new', 'holiday', 'classic', 'entire', 'family']",The Santa Clause VHS

Despite that, they will still enjoy the film.  The Christmas Eve in Denny's alone is worth the price of the video, and there are cute little homages to everything from James Bond to John Knox!  Peter Boyle also has a great supporting role.For no conceivable reason, Allen snipes with his ex-wife's new beau, Judge Reinhold.  It is unclear why either man would want the anorectic and rather dull Wendy Crewson, but, heck, you have to take some things on faith at Christmastime, right?  Besides, Allen's running commentary on Reinhold's egregiously ugly sweaters is worth attending to.So, yes, don't expect THE BISHOP'S WIFE, or MIRACLE on 34th STREET, but order CLAUSE, pop it in the DVD player and settle back for some fun and laughs and a good family film!",3,"Not a classic, but not bad",1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,1541,"['already', 'have', 'DVD', 'library', 'well-stocked', 'holiday', 'classics', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'farther', 'afield', 'decent', 'addition', 'Christmas', 'collection', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', 'theaters', 'disc', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'bet.Basically', 'wholesome', 'kid-centric', 'family', 'film', 'harried', 'divorced', 'ad', 'executive', 'ably', 'wittily', 'played', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'who', 'win', 'affections', 'estranged', 'son', 'Charie', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'one', 'disastrous', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'Allen', 'snookered', 'standing', 'Santa', 'Claus.Kids', 'will', 'just', 'eat', 'up', 'film', 'Charlie', 'wishes', 'fulfilled', 'family', 'patches', 'things', 'up', 'Santa', 'very', 'own', 'dad.Adults', 'will', 'find', 'Charlie', 'just', 'awful', 'alternately', 'bratty', 'petulant', 'pathetic', 'whiny', 'smug', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Denny', 'alone', 'price', 'video', 'are', 'cute', 'little', 'homages', 'everything', 'James', 'Bond', 'John', 'Knox', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'also', 'great', 'supporting', 'role.For', 'conceivable', 'reason', 'Allen', 'ex-wife', 'new', 'beau', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'unclear', 'why', 'man', 'would', 'want', 'anorectic', 'rather', 'dull', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'heck', 'have', 'take', 'things', 'faith', 'Christmastime', 'right', 'Besides', 'Allen', 'running', 'commentary', 'Reinhold', 'egregiously', 'ugly', 'sweaters', 'worth', 'attending', 'to.So', 'yes', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'THE', 'BISHOP', 'WIFE', 'MIRACLE', '34th', 'STREET', 'order', 'CLAUSE', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player', 'settle', 'back', 'fun', 'laughs', 'good', 'family', 'film']",The Santa Clause VHS

Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) plays the part of a divorced toy company executive who wants to spend Christmas with his son. Charlie is not exactly thrilled with the prospects of his father's culinary talents and they opt out for dinner at Denny's. Later that evening after Scott has read The Night Before Christmas to Charlie, Charlie awakens to the ""clattering"" on the roof. Scott runs outside to find reindeer on his roof and Santa who then suddenly falls off the roof. Ooopps.So, what will happen to all the presents and who will deliver them? Scott puts on the red suit and by doing so enters into the"" Santa Clause"" and must be the next Santa. In order to prepare for his duties, he physically changes into the jolly Santa everyone loves. Scott mentions a few ""versions"" of Santa Claus who are loved by millions of children all over the world. This legendary figure is portrayed in this movie as a jolly, stout man with a twinkle in his eye, rosy-red cheeks and a cheerful laugh. This is the American adaptation of the European legend of Saint Nicholas.Though he may look a bit different in each country and be called many names, to children of all countries his message is the same. They peek out the windows and hope to catch a glimpse of this special man as he flies through the sky, delivering gifts for boys and girls they will get to open on Christmas Day.There are many enjoyable witty lines executed so well by Tim Allen. The script is superb and memorable. The classic ""Tim"" with fire extinguisher in hand to save the flaming family turkey is a must see. Charlie himself says some pretty funny one liners and is quite the actor in this movie. The elves are also adorable and they come to the rescue at a moments notice.A very enjoyable family comedy you can laugh along with, year after year. While this movie doesn't really explain the true meaning of Christmas, it does give some insight into the true spirit of the Holiday Season.~The Rebecca Review",5,Merriment in July ;>,996451200,"07 30, 2001",2001,2229,"['summer', 'weather', 'getting', 'start', 'long', 'snow', 'Christmas', 'cookies', 'hot', 'apple', 'cider', 'just', 'movie', 'awaken', 'inner', 'child', 'who', 'still', 'fascinated', 'life', 'magic.The', 'scene', 'set', 'rather', 'bleak', 'Christmas', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'part', 'divorced', 'toy', 'company', 'executive', 'who', 'spend', 'Christmas', 'son', 'Charlie', 'not', 'exactly', 'thrilled', 'prospects', 'father', 'culinary', 'talents', 'opt', 'out', 'dinner', 'Denny', 'Later', 'evening', 'Scott', 'read', 'Night', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'clattering', 'roof', 'Scott', 'find', 'reindeer', 'roof', 'Santa', 'who', 'then', 'suddenly', 'roof', 'Ooopps.So', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'presents', 'who', 'will', 'deliver', 'Scott', 'red', 'suit', 'doing', 'so', 'enters', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'must', 'be', 'next', 'Santa', 'order', 'prepare', 'duties', 'physically', 'jolly', 'Santa', 'everyone', 'Scott', 'few', 'versions', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'who', 'are', 'loved', 'millions', 'children', 'world', 'legendary', 'figure', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'jolly', 'stout', 'man', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'rosy-red', 'cheeks', 'cheerful', 'laugh', 'American', 'adaptation', 'European', 'legend', 'Saint', 'Nicholas.Though', 'may', 'look', 'bit', 'different', 'country', 'be', 'called', 'many', 'names', 'children', 'countries', 'message', 'same', 'peek', 'out', 'windows', 'hope', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'special', 'man', 'sky', 'delivering', 'gifts', 'boys', 'girls', 'will', 'get', 'open', 'Christmas', 'Day.There', 'are', 'many', 'enjoyable', 'witty', 'lines', 'executed', 'so', 'well', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'script', 'superb', 'memorable', 'classic', 'Tim', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'hand', 'save', 'flaming', 'family', 'turkey', 'must', 'see', 'Charlie', 'pretty', 'funny', 'one', 'liners', 'quite', 'actor', 'movie', 'elves', 'are', 'also', 'adorable', 'come', 'rescue', 'moments', 'notice.A', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'comedy', 'can', 'laugh', 'along', 'year', 'year', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'give', 'insight', 'true', 'spirit', 'Holiday', 'Season.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",The Santa Clause VHS
374792,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6303442447,Reviewer,"[2, 2]","Ever wonder, who is Santa Claus, really?  Where does he come from, how old is he?  How in the world does he squeeze down a chimney, and how does he get in if there isn't a chimney?  What's the deal here?  Well, happily, the answers to these questions and more are finally answered, as the legend of Santa Claus comes to life as never before in ""The Santa Clause,"" directed by John Pasquin and starring Tim Allen.  Scott Calvin (Allen) is an executive with a toy manufacturing company, he's divorced and has a young son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), who still believes in Santa, but is at an age at which doubt is beginning to creep into the picture.  And the fact that Charlie's mom, Laura (Wendy Crewson) has a boyfriend, Dr. Neal Miller (Judge Reinhold), who is a psychiatrist, isn't helping the situation any.  Neal, it seems, is adamant about counseling Charlie in the realities of life, which of course includes the real scoop on Santa, which doesn't go over too well with Scott.Then on Christmas Eve, which Charlie is spending with Scott, a strange thing happens.  There's a clatter on the roof, and Scott rushes outside to investigate, where he discovers a man in a red suit clamoring about on the roof of his two-story house.  As Scott watches, the man loses his footing and falls into the snow on the front lawn.  And to Scott's amazement, it's Santa Claus!  Or at least a guy dressed up like Santa, and he's not in very good shape at the moment.  Lying there on his back, the man hands Scott a card with instructions written on it about what to do in this particular situation.  ""Put on the suit,"" it says, ""The reindeer will know what to do.""  And when Scott looks back up at the roof, what he sees concludes what Neal would probably call an SEE (Significant Emotional Experience), and though he doesn't realize it at the moment, his life is about to change forever...And with that, Pasquin goes on to tell the story of Scott Calvin's amazing odyssey, which puts a humorous, and at times poignant, spin on this contemporary and highly imaginative rendition of the Santa Claus story, which offers much more than merely a fresh face on an old tale.  The Santa angle has that universal appeal that will attract viewers initially, but what makes this story really accessible is the reality which lies beneath the fantasy.  The relationships examined in this film-- the whole situation with Scott, Charlie, Laura and Neal-- are quite common in our modern world, and that obstacle in the lives of these characters puts a necessary balance in the story that makes it more than just another Christmas fantasy.  It puts an edge on the sentimentality that would've been over-the-top had Scott, for example, been a happily married man with a text book family life.  That would've been good for maybe a one hour T.V. special on a Tuesday night, whereas this story and the way it's presented is unique and lends itself well to full length motion picture status.When you think of Tim Allen, you don't necessarily think in terms of Santa Claus-- his Tim Taylor, ""Home Improvement"" persona is simply too far-reaching (there are, in fact, some ""in"" jokes sprinkled subtly throughout this film, like when Scott, in Santa's workshop, picks up a toy tool belt and holds it up to himself)-- but it actually becomes a positive here, and another part of the appeal of this film.  it establishes Scott as a real person, an average guy attempting to cope with the everyday problems of everyday life.  And it keeps the core of the story grounded, which ultimately makes the fantasy work while giving it heart.  So, in retrospect, Allen was a perfect choice for the role of Scott Calvin, and in the long run this just may turn out to be one of his most memorable roles (which is somewhat ironic, as this was Allen's big screen debut), because this is certainly the kind of film that is bound to make a lot of people's annual ""holiday movies to watch"" list, falling into that category of films you can watch over and over again every Christmas season, like ""A Christmas Story."" ""Christmas Vacation,"" ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life.""  All films which, though certainly diverse, have at their center the spirit of Christmas along with family values and traditions, and all told in a way that enables the viewer to readily identify with the characters and the story, which is exactly what this film does.Eric Lloyd turns in a good performance as Charlie, making his character believable while keeping him positive despite the conflicts which surround him, and Crewson and Reinhold are solid in their respective roles, as well.  But in supporting roles, the standout performances come from David Krumholtz, as Bernard, Santa's Head Elf, and Paige Tamada, who is endearing as Judy, the Little Elf.Rounding out the supporting cast are Peter Boyle (Mr. Whittle), Mary Gross (Miss Daniels), Larry Brandenburg (Detective Nunzio), Judith Scott (Susan), Jayne Eastwood (Judy, the Waitress) and Joyce Guy (Principal Compton).  An entertaining and ultimately uplifting movie, ""The Santa Clause"" is funny and enjoyable and has a lot to offer in the way of family entertainment, the kind of film adults and kids alike are going to appreciate.  And it may even make you believe in some things you hadn't even considered before-- but that's for you to figure out as you watch the movie.  And that's the magic of the movies.",4,Tim Allen's Most Memorable Role,1006732800,"11 26, 2001",2001,5398,"['Ever', 'wonder', 'who', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'really', 'Where', 'come', 'how', 'old', 'How',

His ex-wife Laura (Crewson) and her second husband Neil (Reinhold) are trying somewhat to get Charlie out of believing in St. Nick, which of course Scott is totally against.On Christmas Eve just after midnight Charlie wakes up after hearing Santa Claus on the roof. Scott goes outside to see who's up there and Santa FALLS OFF THE ROOF! Now there is no Santa! So Charlie convinces his dad to play Santa for the night. Scott plays along with it and is no match for the real Santa. He has a problem staying quiet. Dogs bark at him, guns and alarms go off, he breaks things, knocks down Christmas trees, etc.Now after he completes Santa's job, he starts to turn into Santa. He gains weight, his hair turns white, and he grows a beard. The funny thing is, whenever he shaves, the hair instantly grows backs. Now, Laura and Neil notice this and they think Scott is doing this purposely to make Charlie like him. So they go to court to end his visitation rights. Now that Christmas is only a month away, he has to face reality and realize HE IS SANTA and that he has a job to do. To help him face his responsibility, Charlie along with the elves are there to help him get ready for the big night.This movie is another Christmas classic that the whole family can enjoy. It's very heartwarming and loving. Buy this movie and you along with you're kids won't be disapointed. Merry Christmas!!

But I'm not sure who eats the cookies and milk if cookies and milk was left out for Santa Clause. But also think of it, Christmas is the only holiday that parents lie to thier kids on who thier presents are from, Easter. Every Easter and Christmas, parents lie to thier kids on who thier presents are from. The Easter Bunny for Easter and Santa Clause from Christmas. I'm not sure on how this all started, but it has to stop. (I don't mean Christmas and Easter) has to stop but parents lying to thier kids on who thier presents are from.

Scott burns the turkey, and he and Charlie go to dinner at Denny's. (Even though we don't know what they ordered for dinner). During the night Santa Clause makes a loud noise on the roof of Scott's house. Charlie wakes up his father and Scott goes outside yells up to Santa causing him to fall. Charlie goes outside and both go on the roof find the Santa's deer and sleigh, and finishes Santa's duties with Scoot dressed as Santa Clause).

374821,A9HB18W9DAC1V,6303442447,Toby J Martin,"[1, 1]","Christmas movies about Santa Claus are a special breed. They all take a few (or all) of the following ingredients, and mix them up into a fun little Christmas flick:* Helping Santa deliver gifts* Santa being a real person or made up, and the need to prove he's real* Santa representing the Christmas spirit* Chillin' out with Santa up in the North Pole (with wacky hijinx)The Santa Clause is one of these family films that do a little bit of everything, in a very endearing way. Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) is a busy executive at a toy company, who doesn't really have time for anything other than work. On his way home from a Christmas party, he makes up stories as to why he's late to meet his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd), ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson), and her new husband Neil (Judge Reinhold) on Christmas Eve. After complaints of being stuck with dad, Charlie finally lets his mom leave, and Scott and Charlie proceed to fail to make Christmas dinner. Bedtime arrives with a reading of ""The Night Before Christmas"", and Scott shows a small bit of love towards his son and tucks him into bed. In the middle of the night, a huge commotion occurs in the house, and the two run outside to see Santa falling off of the roof and landing in the snow. Due to The Santa Clause (with an 'e' for you legal types), since Scott was the one who tried to help dead Santa, Scott is now Santa Claus (Scott Calvin/Santa Claus - SC, get it!). The rest of the movie deals with Scott trying to take over as Santa, both in role and physical shape, and the effects it has on both his family and professional life.I really enjoy this movie as a holiday classic. Tim Allen's role as Santa is fantastic, with both his quips to his family as well as the children he meets his first Christmas as Santa. This movie came out around the time when Home Improvement was on TV, and even though you can see bits and pieces of ""Tim Taylor"" throughout the movie, Tim Allen did a great job in making a separation between his famous role, and his role as Santa here. While Wendy Crewson's mother role was weak, both Eric Lloyd and Judge Reinhold worked wonders with their role. You can truly feel Charlie's love of his father, and how much he dearly wants to hold on to the Santa belief. Judge Reinhold's acting style comes off extremely fitting in his role as a father/psychiatrist, in both trying to deal with a family, and a step-son who he feels has Santa issues.There are two major life issues this movie handles EXTREMELY well. The first issue is divorce/separated families. All of the actions in this film in that regard, are shown in a civil manner, with the parents never fighting over Charlie, or making him feel out of place or unloved. This is always nice to see in films, especially as someone who came out of a divorced family with two parents who always treated me properly.The other issue is Santa Belief. Obviously as we've all gotten older, we've stopped believing in Santa Claus. Christmas turns into a time of family and love for most of us, and we realize that the gifts we've always gotten were from the ones who truly care about us. When movies come out, they usually tread (or cross) the fine line of making Santa still seem real, or flat out saying that he's fake. This movie, even with Tim Allen taking over Santa's role, would still let a child seeing this movie believe that Santa is the dude that flies over the world in one night, dropping off presents for the good kids and coal for the bad ones. I HIGHLY applaud this in this film, because a child's beliefs are for them to keep or lose, and not to be taken by a movie trying to make a point.Overall, this is one of those ""Watch ever year"" Christmas films that will leave you smiling at the end of the night, remembering back to your childhood fun of leaving milk and cookies for Santa, and not being able to sleep because of all the sweet presents that were coming your way.",5,My review,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,3918,"['Christmas', 'movies', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'are', 'special', 'breed', 'take', 'few', 'following', 'ingredients', 'mix', 'up', 'fun', 'little', 'Christmas', 'flick', '*', 'Helping', 'Santa', 'deliver', 'gifts*', 'Santa', 'being', 'real', 'person', 'made', 'up', 'need', 'prove', 'real*', 'Santa', 'representing', 'Christmas', 'spirit*', 'Chillin', 'out', 'Santa', 'up', 'North', 'Pole', 'wacky', 'hijinx', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'one', 'family', 'films', 'do', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'very', 'endearing', 'way', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'busy', 'executive', 'toy', 'company', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'time', 'anything', 'other', 'work', 'way', 'home', 'Christmas', 'party', 'up', 'stories', 'why', 'late', 'meet', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'ex-wife', 'Laura', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'new', 'husband', 'Neil', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'complaints', 'being', 'stuck', 'dad', 'Charlie', 'finally', 'mom', 'leave', 'Scott', 'Charlie', 'proceed', 'fail', 'make', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'Bedtime', 'reading', 'Night', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'Scott', 'small', 'bit', 'love', 'towards', 'son', 'bed', 'middle', 'night', 'huge', 'commotion', 'house', 'two', 'run', 'see', 'Santa', 'falling', 'roof', 'landing', 'snow', 'Due', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'e', 'legal', 'types', 'Scott', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'tried', 'help', 'dead', 'Santa', 'Scott', 'now', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Scott', 'Calvin/Santa', 'Claus', 'SC', 'get', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'Scott', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'Santa', 'role', 'physical', 'shape', 'effects', 'family', 'professional', 'life.I', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'holiday', 'classic', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'role', 'Santa', 'fantastic', 'quips', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'first', 'Christmas', 'Santa', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'when', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'was', 'TV', 'even', 'can', 'see', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Tim', 'Taylor', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'separation', 'famous', 'role', 'role', 'Santa', 'here', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'mother', 'role', 'was', 'weak', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'worked', 'wonders', 'role', 'can', 'truly', 'feel', 'Charlie', 'love', 'father', 'how', 'much', 'dearly', 'hold', 'Santa', 'belief', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'acting', 'style', 'off', 'extremely', 'fitting', 'role', 'father/psychiatrist', 'trying', 'deal', 'family', 'step-son', 'who', 'Santa', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'life', 'issues', 'movie', 'EXTREMELY', 'well', 'first', 'issue', 'divorce/separated', 'families', 'actions', 'film', 'regard', 'are', 'shown', 'civil', 'manner', 'parents', 'never', 'fighting', 'Charlie', 'making', 'feel', 'place', 'unloved', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'films', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', 'came', 'out', 'divorced', 'family', 'two', 'parents', 'who', 'always', 'treated', 'other', 'issue', 'Santa', 'Belief', 'Obviously', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'older', ""'ve"", 'stopped', 'believing', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Christmas', 'time', 'family', 'love', 'most', 'realize', 'gifts', ""'ve"", 'always', 'gotten', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'truly', 'care', 'When', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'usually', 'tread', 'cross', 'fine', 'line', 'making', 'Santa', 'still', 'seem', 'real', 'flat', 'out', 'saying', 'fake', 'movie', 'even', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'taking', 'over', 'Santa', 'role', 'would', 'still', 'let', 'child', 'seeing', 'movie', 'believe', 'Santa', 'dude', 'world', 'one', 'night', 'dropping', 'off', 'presents', 'good', 'kids', 'coal', 'bad', 'ones', 'HIGHLY', 'applaud', 'film', 'child', 'beliefs', 'are', 'keep', 'lose', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'movie', 'trying', 'make', 'point.Overall', 'one', 'Watch', 'ever', 'year', 'Christmas', 'films', 'will', 'leave', 'smiling', 'end', 'night', 'remembering', 'back', 'childhood', 'fun', 'leaving', 'milk', 'cookies', 'Santa', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'sleep', 'sweet', 'presents', 'were', 'coming', 'way']",The Santa Clause VHS

I remember this movie coming out in 1994 and really wanting too see it in theaters, but I couldn't, so I had too wait till the VHS came out in 1995 to see it, and it has been an annual viewing since.  And for my review I'm just going too say that the movie itself deserves a 5 out of 5 rating - the reason for the 2 out of 5 above is mostly for the Blu-Ray itself.I've had the third Santa Clause movie on Blu-Ray for about 2 years now and it really looks good, so I was excited when I heard that the first two were making their Blu-Ray debut.  Unfortunately, these are discs that were produced fast and without the care required.On the Santa Clause 3 English audio was provided in both LPCM and Dolby Digital 5.1, for the first Santa Claus Disney went with what sounds like the same mix that was used for the 2002 DVD, but encoded it in DTS-HD 5.1 instead of Dolby Digital.  The picture quality of the few scenes I looked at appeared too be about as good as the 2002 DVD when my PS3 up's it too 1080p. (The picture on the 3rd movies DVD and Blu-Ray is a lot sharper and clearer on the Blu-Ray.)Bonus items: nothing new here and, in fact, Disney dropped one bonuses.  The bonuses consist of ""So you want To Be An Elf?"" (a fun little behind the scenes look at the making of the film that doesn't go into great depth, and is from the 2002 DVD, and it's presented here in 480p, but at a bit rate topping out at 11 Mbps), the 1933 Silly Symphony cartoon ""The Night Before Christmas"", which, on the 2002 DVD was a hidden bonus that was unlocked by beating ""Santa's Helper"" Trivia Game (which is not present). ""The Night Before Christmas"" also knocks the bonuses down quite a bit because instead of using the High-Definition transfer that was made for the ""More Silly Symphonies"" DVD set from the Walt Disney Treasures line, the Disney people decided to use an old tape master as the source, since you can see the edges of the Silly Symphony logo having that tape crawl that came from early NTSC tape transfers.  The last bonus is the Wolfgang Puck collection of Christmas baking videos that were also on the 2002 DVD.That just leaves the menu of he disc.  The 2002 DVD had a full motion menu that was of Charlie' house with the car in front in a snow globe in front of a Christmas Tree, and there was even a button on the menu too ""shake"" the globe and get snow falling.  On the Blu-Ray you get nothing like that.  The menu just has a static picture  of the cover picture.All in all I would recommend the 2002 DVD over the Blu-Ray.",2,Fun Classic Gets Bad Blu-Ray,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,2546,"['Santa', 'Clause', 'remember', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', '1994', 'really', 'wanting', 'too', 'see', 'theaters', 'could', ""n't"", 'had', 'too', 'wait', 'VHS', 'came', 'out', '1995', 'see', 'been', 'annual', 'viewing', 'review', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'too', 'say', 'movie', '5', '5', 'rating', 'reason', '2', '5', 'above', 'mostly', 'Blu-Ray', 'itself.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'third', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'movie', 'Blu-Ray', '2', 'years', 'now', 'really', 'good', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'making', 'Blu-Ray', 'debut', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'discs', 'were', 'produced', 'fast', 'care', 'Santa', 'Clause', '3', 'English', 'audio', 'was', 'provided', 'LPCM', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'first', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Disney', 'went', 'what', 'same', 'mix', 'was', 'used', '2002', 'DVD', 'encoded', 'DTS-HD', '5.1', 'instead', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'picture', 'quality', 'few', 'scenes', 'looked', 'appeared', 'too', 'be', 'as', 'good', '2002', 'DVD', 'when', 'PS3', 'up', 'too', '1080p', 'picture', '3rd', 'movies', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'lot', 'sharper', 'clearer', 'Blu-Ray', 'Bonus', 'items', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'fact', 'Disney', 'dropped', 'one', 'bonuses', 'bonuses', 'consist', 'So', 'want', 'Be', 'Elf', 'fun', 'little', 'scenes', 'look', 'making', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'great', 'depth', '2002', 'DVD', 'presented', 'here', '480p', 'bit', 'rate', 'topping', 'out', '11', 'Mbps', '1933', 'Silly', 'Symphony', 'cartoon', 'Night', 'Before', 'Christmas', '2002', 'DVD', 'was', 'hidden', 'bonus', 'was', 'unlocked', 'beating', 'Santa', 'Helper', 'Trivia', 'Game', 'not', 'present', 'Night', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'also', 'bonuses', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'instead', 'using', 'High-Definition', 'transfer', 'was', 'made', 'More', 'Silly', 'Symphonies', 'DVD', 'set', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Treasures', 'line', 'Disney', 'people', 'decided', 'use', 'old', 'tape', 'master', 'source', 'can', 'see', 'edges', 'Silly', 'Symphony', 'logo', 'having', 'tape', 'crawl', 'came', 'early', 'NTSC', 'tape', 'transfers', 'last', 'bonus', 'Wolfgang', 'Puck', 'collection', 'Christmas', 'baking', 'videos', 'were', 'also', '2002', 'DVD.That', 'just', 'menu', '2002', 'DVD', 'had', 'full', 'motion', 'menu', 'was', 'Charlie', 'house', 'car', 'front', 'snow', 'globe', 'front', 'Christmas', 'Tree', 'was', 'even', 'button', 'menu', 'too', 'shake', 'globe', 'get', 'snow', 'falling', 'Blu-Ray', 'get', 'nothing', 'menu', 'just', 'static', 'picture', 'cover', 'picture.All', 'would', 'recommend', '2002', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray']",The Santa Clause VHS

Tim Allen was a surprise (back in the day) in this role -- funny throughout, he is completely believable as the absent father, and yet somehow turns it around to portray a very believable and caring Dad.

374827,A1ACZLAKFO6H4Y,6303442447,Will Pearce,"[0, 0]","'The Santa Clause' is a Disney movie centered around the Christmas season. Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) is a single parent with a son Charlie (Eric Lloyd).  Scott is a toy salesman for a large toy manufacturer. When Charlie's mom Laura Miller (Wendy Crewson) and step dad Dr. Neal Miller (Judge Reinhold) drop Charlie off at Scott's home for Christmas Eve dinner, they tell Scott that Charlie does not believe in Santa Claus. All of Scott's attempts to provide a good dinner fail, and Scott and Charlie end up at Denny's for a Christmas Eve Dinner. Charlie is awakened by a noise on the roof, and when Scott and Charlie go outside to investigate, they find Santa on the roof. Santa slips off the roof and is killed from the fall. While looking for identification, Scott finds a business card on Santa. The card states that Scott must take over for Santa. The reindeer take Scott and Charlie on the appointed rounds, delivering toys to the girls and boys, before ending up at the North Pole. Bernard (David Kurmholtz), the head elf, explains to Scott that when he put on the Santa suit he became the new Santa Claus, because of the 'Santa Clause'. Over the next year, Scott loses his job as a toy salesman, gains weight, and grows facial hair that turns white.  Director John Pasquin attempted to inject comedy into the sensitive subject of believing in Santa Claus. Trying to make a movie for all ages is especially hard when the subject is Santa Claus. I believe the use of the police in this movie was not the right approach for a children's movie, because children are instructed from early on in life that police officers are their friend and present to help them in a time of need, only to be further confused by the sight of their friend taking Santa Claus to jail on Christmas Eve.  The animation of the reindeer was superb. The fact that Charlie's step dad, psychiatrist Dr. Miller, wanted a weenie whistle for Christmas was one of the funnier parts of the movie. My opinion is that this movie rates on the low end of the Disney collection.
