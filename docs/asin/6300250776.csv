This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  JoBeth Williams is fantastic in her roles as suburban housewife Cathy Palmer who has a secret dream of being a published author AND as fearless multi-lingual agent Rebecca Ryan.  Her very appearance changes as she leaves one role and enters the other.  This is easily her best performance and I thoroughly enjoyed the snappy writing, the excellent choreography of dance and movement, and the clothes...oh, the clothes.  Tom Conti is a perfect foil and together they rule the screen.

When Cathy wakes up after being struck by a car, she finds herself at the center of a frenetic Rebecca Ryan mystery.  But is it real?  The plot gets thicker, deeper, and zanier as the film goes along, but never steps over the boundary into absurdity.

It's a sophisticated grown-up version of the young-adult &quot;Romancing the Stone.&quot;  The portrayal of the marriage avoids all the Hollywood cliches of bad marriages.  The husband is considerate (on the surface), polite, etc. and totally clueless of his wife's feelings.  So, she has built a dream life for herself made up of romance novels and especially indentifies with one strong heroine, Rebecca Ryan.  In a traffic accident in Paris, she is knocked unconscious and becomes her alter-ego.The genius of the film is that we can see the world through her eyes and also see it the way it is, and the contrast between the two is hilarious.  But the film even goes beyond that.  By chance, some of the people she encounters and treats with suspicion really ARE up to something, and her behavior forces them to make mistakes and reveal themselves.  Thus, illusion and reality begin to merge, with even more hilarious results.

AMERICAN DREAMER stars JoBeth Williams in one of her greatest roles, with fine support from Tom Conti and Coral Browne.As a faithful wife to her colourless husband (James Staley) and attentive mother to two boys (Huckleberry Fox, C.B. Barnes), Cathy Palmer finds more romance and adventure in her beloved ""Rebecca Ryan"" novels.  Cathy enters a contest where she has to submit a story written in the style of ""Rebecca Ryan"", and wins the trip to romantic Paris.  Her husband forbids her to go, but realising this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Cathy packs her bags and goes alone.  While siteseeing, Cathy is mugged and hit by a car, and waking up the hospital becomes convinced that she is indeed Rebecca Ryan, in the middle of one of her famous cases of international espionage.JoBeth Williams is so wonderful as Cathy/Rebecca and turns in one of her greatest performances.

I have watched it  numerous times, and I always laugh. There is something about it, that no matter how many times  I view it, it always feels fresh.  Jobeth Williams is beautiful as the  bored house-wife who is patronized, carefully  ridiculed, and ignored by  her boring, self- indulging husband. Everything she attempts to do, he  sabotages by treating her as a misguided child who needs to be under the  control of her husband. When Williams's  Cathy wins a trip to Paris for  two, her husband immediately says it's silly and they won't be going. But  Cathy, who feels it's her one shot at feeling alive, arranges for a  babysitter and heads to Paris in her matronly clothes. Once there, she is  hit by a car, and upon awakening in the hospital, takes on the persona of  Rebecca Ryan, a super-sleuth from a mystery series. Her whole demeaner and  appearance becomes the take-charge character of Rebecca, even to the extent  of charging clothes from elite Paris boutiqes to the hotel where Rebecca  Ryan, mystery book character, resides fictionally.  Rebecca&quot; arrives with all her charged  packages at the famous hotel, greets the baffled &quot; Dimitri,&quot; her  assistant (Tom Conti), who is the son of the author of the Rebecca Ryan  books. The adventure quickens, with Dimitri at first thinking it is a joke  arranged by some friends, until the mild but exasperated  &quot;assistant&quot; realizes that Cathy really thinks she's Rebecca Ryan  , who believes she is hot on the trail of a cold war incident. The two  amateurs become enbroiled in real danger, with Rebecca/Cathy at the helm of  the caper.  Jobeth Williams is outrageouly serious in this mad-cap romp  through Paris with the frustrated and mild-mannered Conti at her side.

229417,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6300250776,Reviewer,"[78, 82]","An exuberant wife and mother of two, with a flair for the written word finds adventure in ""American Dreamer,"" a comedy from director Rick Rosenthal.  Cathy Palmer (JoBeth Williams) enters a writing contest  (two-thousand words written in the style of the famous ""Rebecca Ryan""  adventure-thriller series) and wins a week-long trip for two to Paris,  France, to attend a luncheon to be given in her honor.  When her  patronizing husband, Kevin (James Staley) refuses to go (too much work at  the office), and forbids her to go, as well, she asserts herself, finds a  sitter for her two boys and goes anyway.  While taking in some of the  sights of Paris on her way to the luncheon, she is hit by a car and bashes  her head on the pavement.  When she awakens in the hospital, she thinks she  is Rebecca Ryan, and her real adventures begin in earnest.  First, a new  wardrobe, charged to the hotel in which ""Rebecca"" resides.  Actually, it's  the home of Alan McMann (Tom Conti), son of Margaret McMann (Coral Browne),  the author of the ""Ryan"" series.  When Cathy shows up at Alan's as Rebecca,  he takes it as a joke being played on him by one of his friends, and goes  along with it.  And very quickly, he wishes he hadn't; before he knows it,  they're up to their necks in intrigue, involving political machinations and  heads of state from a number of different countries.  Not to worry, though,  ""Rebecca Ryan"" is on the case.  It's all a flight of fancy, played with  gusto by the delightful JoBeth Williams.  Her Cathy is the dutiful wife and  mother, not necessarily demure, but cautious; when Rebecca takes over,  however, she lets go without restraint.  Rebecca comes on with both  barrels, spunky and full of moxie, and Williams sells it completely,  playing perfectly off of Conti's initially bemused, then confused, and  ultimately alarmed Alan.  Their timing is right on the money, and Rosenthal  never lets it slow down; for this kind of story to work, it has to move  fast, and it has to stay fun, and on both fronts Rosenthal succeeds.  The  story itself may lack some plausibility, but it doesn't make any  difference; just suspend any disbelief for awhile, and go with it, because  this movie is just what it's supposed to be:  Entertaining and funny.  And,  it doesn't hurt that Williams sprinkles it all with charm.  There's some  memorable scenes here, including one in which Rebecca, at a party for some  dignitaries, whispers what turns out to be a secret code to Don Carlos  (Jean Rougerie), an ambassador from Spain, the consequences of which are  hilarious.  The supporting cast includes Giancarlo Giannini (Victor),  Pierre Santini (Inspector Klaus), Leon Zitrone (Ivan), Christopher Daniel  Barnes (Kevin, Jr.) and Huckleberry Fox (Karl).  ""American Dreamer"" is  light, breezy fare; it's well made and delivered with plenty of fun, thanks  mostly to Williams, with an able and noteworthy assist from both Conti and  Rosenthal.  This may not be a classic, but for an evenings entertainment,  this will aptly fill the bill.  Moreover, it's one you're going to want to  watch more than once, because it's fun, and it's going to leave you with a  smile on your face.

Penola,"[11, 12]","I will never understand why this movie did not catch on -- all of the big critics claim miscasting -- but I think this is a delightfully original and very, very funny movie.  With charm to spare, the spy/adventure/dreamer  elements come to together in a creative, if sometime predictable way, and  by the breathless finale, you are completely caught up in the situations of  all of the major players.  JoBeth Williams is so completely committed to  both sides of her character, including of course the novel heroine, that  she shoots sparks and is deliriously entertaining and funny in her  seriousness.  Tom Conti displays his winning puppy-dog quality, and the  oddball pairing seems, in the end, absolutely perfect.

It's actually a gem, perfectly paced and filmed.The hero/heroine with amnesia who develops a new, more dynamic identity, may seem a bit tired these days, but when this movie released it was fresh and strong. Female secret agents were under-utilized and it's nice to see JoBeth Williams - who has natural good looks as opposed to manufactured beauty - be cocky and daring while never loosing her wit. Tom Conti makes an excellent love interest.
